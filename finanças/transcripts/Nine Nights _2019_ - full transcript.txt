Is she even serious right now? Mom, Michael went... We gotta talk about tactics, mom. I reckon she's gonna make the team. She's very peristent. Aren't you, Marc? Really? Listen to your brother. I just hope all of this training's gonna pay off. You're gonna get some medals or something. I'm gonna go to Lucille's on my own, yeah, but back in time for your race. Gonna be here, hon? I'll see you here, yeah? Yeah. Phyllis is good. She's always going. She's got the spirit of a fighter. God rest her soul. I mean, who wants to look like their dead dad. And especially if you're a girl. See how he looks over here. He can't keep his eyes off you. Yo, what's good? What you think? Not bad. You good. You did good still. These. The ones. I'm starving. I'm getting her number. Nah. Yes. Do you really think I can win? You're racing girls not me so of course. Just focus on that finish line. You coming? I'll meet you there. Go on. You better not be late. My sis running for gold. Course I'll be there. I got the perfect place to take those girls. Yeah? Picnic in the woods. The woods? Yeah. These babes deserve somewhere different. Private. Romantic. It's different all right. Yeah. But why the woods? 'Cause me and Marc found it. Don't say anything. The best thing is nobody will bother us 'cause they don't know where it is. You know that's where people die, you know? - In the woods. - Oh, come on. Bro, don't be like that. Bro, are you in or not? Yeah? Better have a bet on it 'cause man's got plans. What? Yeah, you know. Is that yeah? Yeah, that's right. Pulled out all the stops. I mean it's a bit creepy. Ah, don't be creeped out by it. It's fine. Just 'cause it's private. It's like a rubber forest. Don't be like that. Come on, come on. Come on, it's gonna be fine. All right? Listen, no one's got you but me. Okay. Come down with me. Road special. What you think? It's cute. Not bad, eh? Thank you. It's all about presentation, you see. Do you want some help? I'm all right. I've got this. I will work this. Here we go. Oh no. No, no. Shit. Wait, where you going? Come on, Marcie. Second is not so bad. You did good. Yeah, that was sick, Marc. You did good. Where is he? Where is he? I called him but I don't know where he is. Mommy, where's Mikey? There was an accident. An accident? Excuse me, excuse me. Get out of the way. Excuse me. Miss? My brother's here. Mikey. Michael Haines. H-A-I-N-E-S. Date of birth. Third of November 2000. Okay, he's not here now, love. But this is the nearest hospital. Let me see if I can get someone for you. Where's your mother? No. What the? Paul, come here. Where is she? Where does she live? Who? That skank Anna. Listen, if anything's happened to Michael, I'm gonna blame you 'cause you always got him sneaking around, acting up. Where does she live? What are you talking about? That skank Anna. Tell me where she lives. I don't know. Marcie. Stop this now. Yeah? What? Tell me where she lives and I'll leave you. Just tell me. I don't know. You know what? Forget it. Marcie. Sorry. You have no new messages. I don't know what to say to you. I can't. He'd want you to have this. Take it. He said. He said it was his good luck charm. Oh, that's really nice. Auntie. So glad you're here. Oh, Marc, it's all right. You can help me find Michael and drive me around. Darling, find him? Yeah, people are saying all kinds of weird things. They even said he was dead. I know right? I mean, if Mikey were dead, I would know. I mean, that time when he hurt his leg and I had the same pain in mine. Remember when he got lost and I knew where to find him? Yes. Ain't it true, mom? She doesn't even care, does she? Of course she cares, Marc. Why are they all here? This is nine night, Marc. This is where people come and pay their respect. Please have some. How? By eating people out of their house and home? Okay Marcie, stop it now, darling. Why are they here? You're upsetting people. I'm upsetting people. Mikey would kill himself laughing with all this mourning. Let's go. Come on. Nora, you know you can leave this to me. What? Now people say I can't cook? Please. You could've picked up the phone. Did you wash that rice three times? Rude boy, still alive? Very much so and for the foreseeable future. Sorry for your loss, girl. Life goes on. Pay him no mind. Life is a road we all must travel. And death is a destination for us all. Now this helps everyone. So you believing that Mikey's dead? Child, who would make up something like this? We are one family. One heart. Is that why everyone's here? Yes, for the nine nights. It's open house for everyone. The man down the road might never had said hello to Michael, yet he's welcome just the same. But I know he's out there. I can feel it. What you mean, girl? The Lord rose from the dead in three days. That was a miracle. For mere mortals... Although, the first three nights are pure confusion. Their shock understandable. A person finds themself dead. And those left behind don't want to accept he's gone. Maybe we stop this now. No, I wanna hear it. So those left behind don't want to accept things and those that have departed, when the Lord plays your life back and holds you to account. That's night three. Tonight six. Transference. Transference? Yes, transference. Transference is getting ready to accept your fate. Like when you go on holiday, you're excited, but then you got to sort out the detail. Pack your bags. Pay your bills. The bills. Redemption hurts. Night six the departed starts their journey to the afterlife. There's no going back. That's right. Both sides have to give up. The deceased have to forfeit anything they know. Otherwise the last three days, it's a tug of war. They will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Call it what you like. Paradise, nirvana, whatever. A spirit can never be earthbound. Earthbound? Let's just say you no want meet a restless spirit. Exactly. The ticket has been paid for. You have to get on the plane. That's how it is. That's how it's always been. And I say amen to that. Hey sis. Mikey. Oh Jesus Christ. Shit. Let me help. Please? Careful. Sorry. She'll come round, you know. In time. Come round? Have you heard her? She's still calling out her dead brother's name. Have you considered that perhaps she might... Obsessed. She's always been obsessed. I mean, I know they're twins but Jesus. Even I'm not allowed in. No wonder he needed his own space. So it's true? You knew he was sneaking out at night. Yeah, well. I wasn't happy about it, but he's 17 years old. He was almost a. Nearly a man. So have you? You thought about whether you'd like Mikey to be buried or cremated? Don't you dare. Marcie. Mikey, where are you? You said you were gonna be there. And you know what? Just call me back. The first three nights are pure confusion. And those left behind don't want to accept he's gone. What's going on? Now child, I know it's not easy. These things are tragic. You know he hates when you come in here messing things up. Watch when he finds out. We're doing this for him. It's okay. He's just doing his man thing. He'll be back. Marcie. We shouldn't be arguing at a time like this. Great. Let's go back to being best friends, shall we? Here. No. Aunt Sylvie said... She's not your fucking auntie. Well we put together a chart for the nine nights that might. Cool. Always wanted one of these. No, that's not what it's for. Well, I'll make sure Mikey sees it, yeah. Best of three? Cool. Where did you get this? Your mom gave it to me. Where did you get this? Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it to me. What are you doing? What have you done to Mikey? Give it to me. What are you? Give it to me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. See? Mikey would never give him this. What are you doing? I gave that wristband to Paul. Paul, are you okay? Paul and Mikey were tight. He's going through with it. We all are. Oh, fuck off. Oh my God, we'll all be maimed at this, right? What are those tablets for? Please tell me you're not giving these to Marc. Do you know how strong these are? Well she needs them. She or you? Excuse me but are you the doctor? Last I checked you were just a nurse. Oops, sorry. Was a nurse. You can't sedate this away, Nora. Yeah right. You have a child upstairs that needs you. I do not need child caring tips from you. How many kids you got again? That's low. God, that's low even for you. Sis, I'm here. Come. Uh uh, where are you going? Darling, it's late. Running helps me clear my mind. Well, perhaps you can go for a run in the morning. Mikey's back. Ugh Sylvie, your cases are in the way. Put them. Where would you like me to put them, Nora? Put them somewhere. And where are you going? I thought you were asleep. - Auntie. - Hey what? You're not going nowhere, you know. I'll go around the back. Well are you gonna go after her? You want me to watch her 24 seven? I'm trying to plan a funeral here, Sylvie. Yeah well perhaps you'd allow someone to help. There's nothing to see here. Girl, what the hell are you playing at? Get in. Look, I'm sorry for hitting you. I didn't mean... Sh. I'm sure I'll survive. It's fine. You know, I think I saw Michael and I think he saw me but he didn't wait for me. He must be in such a mess. You know sometimes, Marcie, when people die, it feels like they come to us, but oh darling it's not real. You know what's not real? Is that when dad died, there was none of this nine nights. One minute everything was cool and the next boom. You were gone, he was gone, and no one was there. And it was just me and Michael. Your mother was there, too. Yeah but why did you leave us? Why? Look it was just. You know, it was a difficult time. Please, can we just leave it as that? All right, cool. I can't believe she collapsed when she saw him. So God send you here? You think? I don't know. Just figured after all this time Nora would at least... Now is not the time for forgiveness. Just be here. That's what's important. So what exactly is it I'm to be forgiven for? You've been gone for seven years. Mikey. That's the girl that saw me. We should be able to get in. Let's see. I don't think it's your kind of scene. Actually I'm here to meet my brother. Who's he when he's at home? Michael Haines. The runner? Yeah.

I've got your phone, stupid. Well I was looking for you. This ain't no game, Mikey. Everyone thinks you're dead. What the hell? What are you on about? Look it was two nights ago and the house was full of strangers talk about this nine nights. What? Anyways, mom said there was an accident. Even Auntie Sylvie's back. Aunt Sylvie? Fuck. I didn't even know what to think and Paul's been acting... Oh, don't tell me. He thinks I'm dead, too. It's not funny and you had something to do with it 'cause he had your wristband. Anyways, I got them. Look, whatever trouble you're in, even if it's girl trouble... You're freaking me out, Marc. I don't know how I got here. Come on, we're leaving. One second, mate. Yo.

Marcie. I'm trying to explain it to you, all right. I can't go right now. Can you listen to me? Huh? Fine. I'll come home. You better not be lying. I know. I'm not. You know, everyone thought you were dead. I didn't believe them. See you in a bit. Don't come back here, miss. You won't be allowed in. Oh, mom. Wait, honey. Morning. Hi. Oh, thank you. These are beautiful. I'll take them. I'll take them. Thanks for the flowers. Join us. There's so much food, please. Are you okay, Marc? Yeah. Oh mom. Well, the whole school chipped in. Oh nice. Everyone loves. Loved Michael. But no one knew him like us, eh? Marc. This funeral. Well, this is your chance to. What you think about getting yellow roses for the church? Yeah, of course. Yellow's our favorite color. That works. This is great. Oh hi. Thanks for coming. Thank you, darling. Good to see you. Please go through. Help yourself to something. Hello. Where you coming from? What's that, trainers? Who you got trainers for? Hello. Yellow roses at the church. Yeah, my ass. Nora. Come on, she's obviously stressed. She's stressed? Do you know what I'm under right now? Do you know what I'm dealing with? On the bright side, at least she started to grieve, huh. You really don't know my daughter at all, do you? Grieving? Her and Michael is like one. She ain't grieving yet. She ain't never gonna be over this. Oh please, put something on. Look at your chest. This ain't a dance. Hi. Thanks for coming, love. Please go through. Go through. Have a drink. Hey, Sister P. How are you? All right. I know you think you saw him. What you saw was not your brother. What you saw a nothing. A ghost. But he's not see through or anything. You want something so badly. Child, you're hanging onto him. It's a one way flight. You can't win. He's just sorting some stuff. He's gonna come back. What stuff? I don't know. He promised. Now listen to me now, you know. The night's no place for a grieving girl. Well? Listen. I don't know if I believe in ghosts, Marc. I mean, you see them in films and all but... But if you could do something you would, wouldn't you? Tina? Tina? Tina? I always wanted to be a makeup artist. Okay, so I'm freaked out. So? Look, I don't need your attitude, okay. I told Michael I'd try and help you. But shouldn't we be helping Michael? Sometimes seeing is believing. Don't let your heart rule your head. Tell you I sing. ♪ I walked away ♪ Come on, Mikey, we're leaving. Tina said she'd try to help you. Yeah, she proper freaked me out. Is she the reason? Come. Come on, Mikey. Talk to me. Remember how confused I was? They told me freaking truth. Everything. About the car. The accident. And the good side is no pain. Yeah but we're here talking like normal. It's not safe for you here, sis. Look, I can look after myself and besides I wanna be where you are. Haines twins forever. Sounds like that Michael Jackson song mom used to play. You won't believe it 'til you see for yourself. That's always been you, sis. No. I'm sorry, darling. I need to check for swelling. What happened? Don't you remember? Oh God, Marcie, you had us so worried. You're just there in the middle of the road. Was I alone? Yeah and I think at least someone must have seen you. Leave it to them to be so bad minded. Hey. Wanna come downstairs, sit with us? Yeah? Good, come on. You'll live. Better get a plastic on that. I haven't seen these before. Dad looks so retro. Oh, your dad. He's worse than a woman. Everything had to be just so. I can't believe you kept these. No point throwing them away is there? Oh. Look at mom. I've seen her before. Where have you seen her before? Don't you remember, Nora? She was the most fabulous singer. Her voice would send shivers through your spine. That's right. She almost had a record deal. So wait, she died? Yeah. Had them singing on a cruise ship and well it went down. All of them. So, so sad. Anyway, let me go look about the chicken. How did dad die? There was an accident. Yeah, but you said that... Yeah, well it's not important now, is it? I know. Look I know, but what am I supposed to do? Look, look, look. I'm sorry, I gotta go. Bye. I thought everyone knew by now. Who you talking to? I did what I had to do. You see here. If you weren't drunk, you're interfering. But you didn't see it like that when you needed me. You know what, Leonore? I had to drink to be able to stand looking at your miserable face day after day. Oh Leonore, it really is no wonder you're on your own. Anything else you wanna add about my bad parenting? Good. See when this is over, go and live with her. Oh, you took your time. - Wow, you look. - Listen. We gotta move fast. Mom wants to send me away and I gotta find Mikey and I can't leave him. She's turning him to lush. Who? Tina from the club drunk. We don't even drink. I get it. I know I'm not supposed to be out right now. I don't know anything about no club. No, fuck you. It's just that. If he's been drinking, messed up, we can't bring him home. He'll get in even more trouble. He's safe where he is, yeah? Let's leave him there and bring him back later. Gives us time to work out a plan. Then he can make a proper entrance. Yeah, exactly. All right. All right, girl. Please leave your message after the tone. Paul, can you call me back, please? Night six the departed starts their journey to the afterlife. There's no going back. You ready, Paul? Whoa, for what? To go for a run. To go get Mikey, idiot. I thought we was gonna have a plan. So where is it? Yeah, thought so. Look, me, your mom, Aunt Sylvie. We've tried everything. Think about your mom. Why do I need to do that when she's got you? Nothing works with you. They've even tried sedating you to help you cope. Everything that happened to Michael, yeah, you imagined it. You know what? You're a traitor and me and Michael can't trust anybody. Just get out of my way. Aren't you tired, child? What you got? There's your feet. Neonatal syndrome. It meant you were literally starving. Remember people used to make a fuss around me all the time? Course we should make a fuss. You were such a cute baby. Oh my God. No, but it was more than that. Auntie Sylvie was way over the top. You were just so tiny. Unbelievably tiny. And then one day. One day your heart stopped. Saying I died? A minute. Seconds. We were lucky we were still at the hospital. What you doing with your hair? You want me to finish it? Come. Mom, did Michael say anything about going to university outside of London? Maybe. You know what he's like. Every day he's got a different plan. He had such big dreams. Please don't go out tonight. I get so worried when you go out. So pretend I put it back. Now I buy no more, you know. You're too much you know, Pastor? Mom. You're locked in? No, I like being held prisoner. Open the door. Who's locked the door? Who's locked the door? I don't know. Mom's gone mad. She's drugging me. What are you playing at? How can you lock the child in the room? You can't do. Do not tell me what to do. This is my house. Come here, yeah. Them don't know you but I know you. All right Leonore, just please give me the key. Please. Thank you. Come round here trying to steal my children. My husband. Oh you know what? Your husband left you because you're a jealous fool. Dad left? You drove dad away. Is that why Michael's not even welcome here? I'm sorry. I didn't. I want you out. You don't mean that. I said get out. I want you out. You're forever pushing me away, Nora. It's fine. Yeah well I'll keep pushing. Get out. Get the fuck out of of my house. Oh, you've lost it. You really lost it. Take your shit and go. All right, I'm going. Come in here trying that shit in here. Get out. Do not tell me what to do. I'm doing my best. Oh, is there something to see here? Do you know what? Take your coat and fuck off and bloody bamba. Don't watch me. Get out. Tell me what to do. Gorgeous. And still she comes. Oh Marc, what are you doing here? Mikey, I was thinking. Maybe Tina can help us with this whole nine nights spin. If she's able to live in both worlds then. You wanna keep him earthbound? 'Cause you can't bring him back. Whoa. Are you sure? I don't wanna be stuck here in my ones. Never seeing my family again. My friends. My sister. Okay. How much do you want to be with him? I'll give anything. Jump. No way. You did before. That was an accident. I thought maybe. What? He was going to get hurt? You tricked me. Why'd you say anything? You're such a bitch. Marc, I didn't mean to. I was confused. And this? Oh, it means nothing. It's not gonna happen now anyway. You were just gonna go to Bristol leave me and mom knew. Maybe she's been right about this whole thing. About this nine nights. Well wait? You're listening to them now? You were just gonna go. It's nothing but secrets and lies with you. All you care about is yourself. No, no, Marcie please. I'm sorry. Why didn't you... Don't touch me. He didn't mean to trick you. Okay, it's a human impulse. Look, I know he's not dead but he's not acting the same. This is some kind of game. You know the truth in your heart. He's still my brother. So how long you been? January 5th, 2007. That was the day Mikey. I saw you that morning. Yeah. It was a weird day. Remember? Sunny and cloudy. Yeah, I had a race, but I knew he would never miss it. What? I don't know. What happened to you? It was one of those stupid, fucking things they call accidents. I was at a party. Took some pills. You overdosed? Yeah, but that didn't kill me. Okay? Some nurse fucked up at the hospital. She was drunk and gave me the wrong dose. Shit. So how come you're still here? Who knows? I didn't have any ties. My mother gone. I hear it sorts stuff out in the end. Karma's a bitch. 10 years is a long time. So what do you think? That'll happen to Mikey? Mikey's surrounded by love. All right? He will be fine if you let him go. It all depends on you. My sis running for gold. They told me the freaking truth. You won't believe it until you see for yourself. Always been you, sis. Sh. After I spent all day cooking. The funeral's this Tuesday. Why do you even care about all those strangers? Am I to blame for Mikey? Baby, no, of course not. Oh darling, you know it's normal you feeling this way. Feeling guilty. Not wanting to let him go. It's all apart of it, yeah. Yeah but everyone says I have to. Mom, Tina, you, but no one explains how. You'll always have Mikey in your heart. Hold onto that. Celebrate that. That sounds so fake. And what if this nine nights doesn't work? You know, every culture has its type of nine nights. A way of celebrating their dead. So, it always works. Well Tina said karma's a bitch and it always gets you. So if Mikey. Tina said karma's a bitch and it always gets you. All right, listen Marc. You have done absolutely nothing wrong. Okay? Karma's just. It's just another belief. Who is this Tina anyway? I mean, you seem to listen to her. What's her last name? Don't know. You don't know her last name? I know she's 17 and she's been dead for 10 years, but it was the hospital that let her down. How'd you explain that? I can't. All right? I can't. I heard you come back into the church. Well, let's just say the Lord has moved me in ways you can't imagine. Oh, I can imagine. Well, you've always had a good imagination. Spirit can never be earthbound. Both sides have to give up. So much beauty in strength in one so young. Is this from you, Auntie? Everyone was right. I know what I have to do now. Mikey. No, Marcie, no. Deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory. Forever and ever. No. Marcie, no. Did you do this? Do what? You're my sister. You were just gonna leave. Suppose I could've said, Marc, you know how we spoke about college? Well I wanna branch out. Go somewhere on my own. Well here I am. Look Mikey, I'm sorry about the accident. About everything. Always following you around. Being jealous. But I never meant any of this. It's okay. You're here now. You told me to go home. You said it was dangerous. I was an idiot. I don't wanna be by myself. Remember, nobody can come between us. Not mom, even dad couldn't. Dad? He's here. Just say you'll stay for good. No, I can't. I can't be here. Can't or won't? Look, I'm ready. Oh, you are? Do I count? Haines twins forever. That's what we said. Forever. You'll be here with dad. Remember the fuss he used to make around your first medal? The only time he noticed me was when I ran. He adored you. That is not true. You were everything to him, even me. Not quite. You were starting to do your own thing. I read your diary. You had no business doing that. Yeah, see how it feels not to have your own space? Don't worry. Can't tell anyone. God, I miss even this. You getting on my nerves. Me trying to fix everything. What are we gonna do? I don't know. I feel different everyday. I'm scared. He didn't mean to trick you. Sleep will help. Hey, need a bit of time, guys. We were so worried. Marc, we're just trying to help you. Look, I've got some food in the kitchen. Why don't you help yourself? Come on, Marc. All right then, I'll speak to you later then. Okay? Cool. Look, I was thinking that Aunt Sylvie can go in Mikey's room since it's bigger. Can you bring me up a snack? You're hungry now? Yeah. Want some curry goat? Mhm. Haven't seen you knock it back like that since. Oh God, what was the name of that club? We practically had our names above the door. What was it called? Long time ago. Crystals. Yeah, Crystals. Lord, we would dance all night and never get tired. Do you remember? We would like angels. No fear. Yeah. Remember these moves. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Move to the side. You never had any rhythm. You know that? I did. All right, watch me now, yeah. Watching, watching. Five, six, seven, eight. Back. Six. Oh Leonore, you know you were never happier than when we were dancing. Oh yeah, just forget everything. You know what I mean? Oh remember Stanley used to watch me when I was dancing. Just a sick guy. He loved watching me dance. You know what I mean? Trouble was he liked watching every other honey, too. No matter who. You know what? Whatever you think happened, Nora, didn't. When are you going to start believing me? We got on. So what? We had to. He couldn't cope on his own. It's not how it look from where I was standing was going on between you two. You think I'm blind? You think I'm blind? You could've had anyone. And there was you taking over all my kids. Yeah? Take over my husband. Yeah? I loved him, Sylvie. Are you listening to yourself? Your kids. Your kids. Your kids would've ended up in care if I hadn't stepped in. All right? So stop fucking laying this at my door. Stanley, you know, he never judged me. Nora, he never fucking judged me. He was always there for me. You carrying on like he's dead, Nora. He's not dead. You, you drove him away. You did it, not me. You cut him off from his kids. You fucking left him, Nora. That is not my fault. What did I do? What did I do? What have I done? He hates me. Everybody hates me. What could keep him away at a time like this, eh? The only thing is he doesn't even hate you. Despite everything he still fucking loved you. He loved you, Nora. He'll be here, all right. He'll be here. Oh come on, we gotta be strong for Marc. - Even for you. - I'll be okay. Yeah. Yeah. Hey. Hey. You needed that rest, didn't you? Yeah. What you listening to? I'm just making a playlist. Listen. It's sick, isn't it? ♪ Precious Lord ♪ ♪ Take my hand ♪ ♪ Lead me on ♪ ♪ Let me stand ♪ ♪ I am tired ♪ ♪ I'm weak ♪ ♪ And I am worn ♪ So Mikey's here. I mean his coffin. It's gonna be all right, Marc. Trust me. Just get through today. Just feels like everything's changing. Things change. Oh. Oh no, Kim, don't worry. Don't leave on my behalf. Was that the playlist? Yeah. Crept in. Corrupt in Conan. Sorry what kind of name is that? I don't understand any of you young people's music. I'm officially old. I know you tried to say goodbye to Mikey. It'll come. That's the thing. Me and Mikey never got a chance to say bye to you. Why did you leave us? Marc, now's not the time. Tell me. Why did you leave? Kim, could you give us a minute actually please? Thanks. No, actually I would prefer you stay. God, you're like a dog with a bone. I mean, Kim. That's the thing about adults. They never explain anything. And you of all people have been honest always. Tell me. Why did you leave us? Something happened, all right. I don't know. I felt. Felt ashamed and I couldn't stay. But it all comes out anyway. - Come on, tell me. - Marcie, please. Just leave it alone. It's gonna be a lovely funeral. Maybe there is some truth in what Marcie's saying. That they can't settle until they're rested. ♪ When the roll is called up yonder ♪ ♪ I'll be there ♪ ♪ When the roll is called up yonder ♪ ♪ When the roll is called up yonder ♪ ♪ When the roll is called up yonder ♪ ♪ When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there ♪ ♪ When the roll is called up yonder ♪ ♪ When the roll is called up yonder ♪ ♪ When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there ♪ ♪ When the roll is called up yonder ♪ ♪ When the roll is called up yonder ♪ ♪ When the roll is called up yonder ♪ ♪ When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there ♪ I got you, my bro.
