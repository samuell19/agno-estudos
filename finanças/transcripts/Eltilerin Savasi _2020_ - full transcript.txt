Kids. Kids! What did I tell you? What's the ruckus? -Be quiet! -Okay, ma'am. Okay, Hande! You're it! Yakup! Don't worry, I'll be back right away, alright? ou must be tired from the trip. Mom, Dad, and I drove here. It took about 13 hours from Istanbul to Rize. It takes me ten hours. You know, we made some stops for needs and such... I also made stops. -I'm sure. -Were you all in the same car? No, ma'am. Mom, Dad, and I drove here. Selim and Sultan... We preferred to fly. She hates long trips. I'm their first daughter-in-law. They butter me up. Right, Mom? You get along so nicely for a girl and her mother-in-law. -Tell me about it. -She's like a mother to me. -Oh! Mom... -Yes, what? Necla, he says it's a bit warm and he doesn't have a spare jacket. He doesn't want to sweat and get sick, so he'd like to remove his jacket, if that's okay. Of course. -I'll take it. -Go ahead. My dad doesn't talk much. A man of few words. Right, Dad? -Right. -Yeah. We met through Hande. -Yeah, I was just the means. -Yeah. -Fatih was a classmate in college. -Yes. -And Gizem is my childhood friend. -Right. -I had just posted a picture of us-- -Sultan and I met at a wedding. We were dancing and she just took my arm. What a dance it was, though! We were all sweaty. I generally don't sweat that much. We went insane. Then I took a look around, no one else was there. Just the two of us. We locked eyes. She said, "I'm Sultan, you?" I said, "I'm Selim." She said, "Oh, Sultan Selim! Take me to your palace." -I liked outgoing girls a lot back then. -Shut up, you! I'll go check on Gizem and help her. -For God's sake, please do. -Okay. Honey... -It's Yavuz. -Oh, yeah? -It's a video call. -Our youngest. He's studying in Europe. They took his passport for the residence permit, -so he couldn't come. We're sorry. -What's up, man? -It's too loud! -Hi, Yavuz! Oh, son... Did you get their blessing? Did her grumpy dad say yes? -We can't hear him, just hang up. -Did he say yes? -Are you an idiot or what? -What? Just hang up. Hey, Gizem. Have you met your sister-in-law before? No, I haven't. But she's a nice lady, like... -Different. -Yeah. -I like her. -So... If I heard correctly, you're going to be neighbors, right? Fatih says so, yeah. He says she'll support me. It's just, maybe you should live a bit farther apart. Living that close won't help, if you don't get along. No, it's not like that. There's an apartment complex on my father-in-law's land. They have three flats and one of them is ours. He gave it to us. It's only logical. We won't have to pay rent. -Anyway, why wouldn't we get along-- -Do you need any help? Şükran! Nah, we took care of everything. It's Sultan, honey. Not Şükran. I'm so sorry, ma'am! I got confused. Ma'am? Honey, I'm like, two years older. Why are you calling me ma'am? Where's the engagement ring? -It's here, look. -She has it on. Let me see. Oh, this one? Where's the diamond? Oh, it's here. So tiny! It's like a speck of dust. Dear God... -It's just how I like them. -Minimalistic and elegant. Girls, I don't mean to brag, but... It's as big as your head. Hey, don't stare! It's bad luck. -It's beautiful. -What about the wedding gown? Remember the one you liked the other day? Yes, I haven't decided yet but that one was nice. -Yes. -The one with the tulle. -Yes, on the shoulders. -It was nice. -So you're going to wear a gown? -Of course. Don't get me wrong, love, it's just that... I just worry people are going to say things, like "Wow, she's as old as my mom and she's wearing a gown?!" Wow. Girls, something stinks in here. It's either you or... Or it's something else in the kitchen. Anyway, bye bye! I'm going to vomit. Did she just take a jab at us? Damn right she did, sis. Oh, Mom, she's dirty. She's no match for me. -There we go. -Bravo! God, yes! -Bravo. -Yay! -Wow, dude. Just wow. -Let's pose. Raise your hand. -What's this? -Say cheese! -You're getting married, huh? -Yeah, bro. You're getting married! -My brother's getting married! -Yeah, bro! We're going to get along so well, Sis. Let's take a pic. -We're sisters-in-law! -Yeah. -We're going to get along so well. -I hope so, ma'am. Ma'am, huh? My home is so much more beautiful Than my sister-in-law's I'm stylish My rustic drapes are ready I never forget getting my nails done Or going to my tailor You'll get what's coming to you soon When I have a baby Just come over for a cup of coffee Witness how well I cook every treat Just don't stare at me too much You'll bring bad luck or something People, say a prayer for me I'm not a potted plant you can throw out I will be noticed If I decide to do something I'll do it well I'm not some pillow you can toss aside I will be noticed I'll gloat and boast And make everyone jealous My home is so much more beautiful Than hers I'm stylish My rustic drapes are ready I never forget getting my nails done Or going to my tailor You'll get what's coming to you soon When I have a baby Ta-da! Here's our block. -So exciting! -We'll walk around and get groceries. This place is beautiful, Fatih. Yeah? Wait till you see the apartment, if they're done with it. I'm so excited! I'll close my eyes. Wait, stop! Let me close my eyes. HOME SWEET HOME Fatih, what the hell?! -Please put me down. -Why? I always do this. Yeah, with all the girls? I'm not one of them. -Aren't you? -Stop, someone's going to see. Please put me down. Come on, Fatih. You'll wake people up. Wow. Fatih! -Alright. -You have to see the kitchen! Unbelievable. Beautiful! -I love it, it's amazing! -Yeah, it's so nice. -The furniture is here, too. -Finally, I must say. Well, we got married so quickly. They had to do it the last minute. -There you go. -Aw, Fatih. -Our home. -Our home. The place is a mess, let me get a cleaning lady. Nah, I'll fix it up in a day. Don't you worry. Oh, my humble wife. I'm going to go change, I have to go to work. Okay. Are you going to tell your mom, hubby? Aren't we done with that yet? -The "hubby" thing? Isn't it the best? -Please, don't. I hate it. Fatih, are you okay? The rug slips. Someone's going to get hurt. Sis! Click! Good morning. I have some hot pastry for you. It's homemade. -This early? You shouldn't have-- -What's up with you? Are you sick? -What is it? -Come closer. What is it? Oh, you just don't have makeup on. Disgusting! You obviously need it. What's this? Damn it, the furniture is all wrong. I told them this is office furniture, but they didn't listen. You've unpacked them, too! How are you going to return them? No, this is our own furniture. I saw your honeymoon pics. The hotel looked awful. Damp, dirty, cheap. I'm so sorry. You should've gone to Dubai. We're going. We're richer. Good for you. Come closer. You know, our neighbor's daughter... She wasn't like you, though. She was so beautiful. Anyway, she had a bad honeymoon and they got divorced immediately. -And? -Just saying. God, this is awful. Just awful. By the way, you're having dinner at our place. It's just us. I won't invite Mom. I'll just cook some pasta. Our place is livelier, since it's well-decorated. Just so you don't get bored from the get-go. The furniture looks very boring. Honey, you're not getting offended, right? I'm just a blunt person. I mean well, though. Ew, what an ugly coatrack. See? I just can't hold it in. I'm incapable of lying. God would strike me down if I called your ugly mug beautiful, or I wouldn't be able to sleep if I called this awful rack nice. Who's this? What are you looking at, you eyesore? Are you in or what? Um... Sure, we'll come, ma'am. Ma'am, huh? Let me see. Every single part of your face is too big and crooked. Ew, I'm going to be sick. I don't know how you live with it. Anyway, bye bye! I'm calm. I don't want to take my sister-in-law by the hair and drag her through the building. Oh, my beautiful wife. Love you. I love Fatih so much. I don't want him to be upset. I'll show you "ma'am" at dinner. What was that? -You look beautiful. -Yeah? -Did you like it? -A lot. Thank you. -Fatih. -Yeah? Am I underdressed? Should I go change real quick? -We haven't brought any gifts either. -You look amazing. -It's just going to be us anyway. -I mean, she said so. But you told me that you don't know her very well. -So? -So, just look at me. I'm underdressed. So what? It's not like she's going to make fun of you. We're family now. Okay. You're right, we're family. Welcome! Wow, Sultan. -Oh, Mom's here, too! -She is? Honey, are you planning to sleep? You're in your pajamas. No gifts either. Look like someone's a bit ill-mannered. You're so cute, uneven face! Come in. Take your shoes off, the floor is expensive. Oh, whose dinner is this? Oh, it's my dinner Eat something, honey. -Have some of Mom's dumpling. -I will, Fatih. -How was I supposed to know? -Alright. Mom, is that you? The chandeliers are blocking my view. Yes, it's me, honey. Oh, your dad wants some salt, honey. Oh, this is flour. -I love having family dinners. -Me too. -I wish Yavuz was here. -Yeah. Yavuz resembles you more, Selim. -Yes, he's handsome, just like my husband. -So I'm not handsome? Well... I'm chubby now, Gizem. I was very handsome when I was younger. But a big belly is a man's golden belt. So, are all of you tall? My husband's taller than yours and I'm taller than you. Lovely. I'm old now, I want grandchildren. Mom, come on, don't be like that. You know Sultan has concerns about it. I'll do it when I'm ready. Young? You're 36, honey. -Shut up, you. -Come on... -You will give me a grandkid, then. -What, me? I'd actually love to, but I want to get a job first. It's your body after all, honey. Look how beautiful she is. Leave the salad, Dad. Just look how beautiful she is. I'm glad I married you. -I'm glad you married me. -God bless. Everyone who saw the wedding video texted me right away, -telling me how beautiful you are. -Thanks. You know, she kind of looks like a Hollywood actress. -Oh, come on! -Exactly. -She also looks European. -Stop it. -Look at those eyes. -Fatih, come on. -That smile. -Shut up. -Dimples and all... -Stop it, Fatih! Ouch! A mosquito bit me! -Ouch, it hurts. -I'm blushing. They always bite me. Must be because of my silky soft skin. -Right, honey? -Right. -How's your mom and dad? -They're okay. They said hi. -How nice. -They miss me a bit, naturally, but they're okay... Mom. Did you call me "Mom"? You're so cute. -Did you call her "Mom"? -Yes. Yes, I did. Come on, it's no big deal. Ouch! What are you doing, Selim? God! He pinched my waist. Do you realize where we are? Your parents are here. -You lover boy. -Come on, I didn't. Shut up, don't lie! I can't believe you. Come here. Come. I love you. Since the day we met. I love you too. -Let's take a pickie! -What's a pickie? -Um, it's-- -Come on, pose for the pickie! -Oh, it's a picture. -Dad! Get in the frame, Mom. Okay. You aren't in it. It's okay. Put that here. You must be surprised. It's the kitchen of Hürrem. -Hürrem? -The sultan. Since my name is Sultan. Lovely. -I was going to ask you-- -Look, my faucet is golden. It's beautiful. Look... -Why didn't you-- -Look at the cabinet handles. Solid gold. -Why didn't you tell me-- -Look at that cover. It's laced with gold. It looks amazing. Why didn't you tell me they were coming? You must've seen these already. Very nice. Because I dressed casual. I'm embarrassed. That's not cool. "That's not cool!" Look at the way you're talking, you're just a rough broad. You are. You even dress rough. Look at this sweater. You're not a feminine spirit like me. Dressing up wouldn't help you anyway. -You're being rude. -Look at my rug. Hey! Don't stare at it, it's bad luck. I'm kidding, go ahead. Look... I actually want you to see my bedroom too, but... Never mind. -You're new, you'll get jealous. -I won't. It's a beautiful room. -It's just that yours is a bit... -What? I promised Selim I wouldn't, but I can't hold it in. I get that you don't have taste, but your bedroom looks like an underground casino! I took a look before and I was like, "Selim! These two are going to play cards in the bedroom every night!" It was so disgusting that it makes me laugh. Oh, I hope you aren't offended, honey. I just couldn't not say it again. I just can't hold it in. My mouth won't stop. I love you, honey. My cute rag doll. Who's this? Hey! You're daydreaming again, piggy! You fell in love with the place. Um, actually, it's not really my style. It's not easy on the eyes. Everything is golden and stuff... Is that so? Come here. I should've been harder on you this morning. By the way... Hollywood? No chance! Follow me, ugly duckling! Ugly duckling? Oh, whose husband is this? Oh, it's my husband The breadwinner My heart's owner My darling This is so ridiculous. -You're awake? -Honey. -Yeah. -Morning. Why didn't you wake me up? I'd get you breakfast. Don't worry about it, honey. You were fighting in your dreams. I figured you'd be tired. I'll eat at work. I'll walk you out. -I'm coming. -Okay. -Stop it, Fatih! -You look nervous. Let me give some to them. -Open it. -Kiss me. Oh, honey. -Brother! -Dude, we're neighbors! -Come here, Fatih! -Sis! -Amazing. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Why did you take my picture, Sis? Don't be ashamed, this is the real you. Look at her face. You devil. Fatih, I'm sure your wife prepared a lovely breakfast since you're newly-weds, but here's a few hot buns for you to eat on your way to work. -It's handmade. -You're a real sultan, Sultan. We haven't eaten yet. Want some? -No, thanks. -Come on, it's handmade. -It'll help with the morning breath. -No, thanks. -Just have one. -No, thanks. That breath is incurable. Alright then. -Oh, call me after the job thing. -Okay. -What thing? -A kindergarten. -Cool! -Thanks, Selim. -She's going to apply today. -Good luck, then. -See you. -Hang on. -Yeah? -I dress him up, too. Don't sweat too much. Oh, Fatih! If the company doesn't renew your car, just get one from Selim's dealer so you can get around. -Don't bother, we're just fine. -She's a new bride, she'll get jealous. -I won't at all. -She will. -I won't. -She will. -I won't. -You will. -No. -Yes. -They're playing around! -You will. -I won't. -You will eventually. -I won't ever. -Your car is awful. Soccer? That'd be amazing, but it's our first night together. Wow, dude, you're such a wimp. Sultan's going to take care of her like a big sister anyway. -Right? -Don't be such a wimp! -Come on, bro. -I'll beat you with my tummy. Take some cues from me. Don't! Stop, dude. We're here, stop. Grow up, man. So, where are you going? I'm going to apply for the job and then get some groceries. "Apply for the job, get some groceries." What kind of speech is that? You're so strange. -I'm strange, sure. -Why are you applying? Because I don't like doing nothing all the time. Do something then. There's plenty to do at home. Comb your hair, put on makeup, paint your nails, remove it, and then repeat, apply a face mask with cinnamon and then avocado, edit a pic then post it on Instagram, do some decoration, cook food, watch TV... See, there's a lot to do. -Sure there is, okay. -Hey. You know, the daughter of one of our relatives... She wasn't like you, though. She was so young, so lively. I'm sure. It was such a shame. She got divorced as soon as she got married. She was devastated. -And? -Just saying. Anyway, bye bye. Honey! I was just going to call you. You won't believe what happened. Gizem? What's up? Is something wrong? Hande, that woman is going to drive me insane. You wouldn't believe how jealous the new bride gets. She constantly takes jabs at me. -So? -So?! She calls this place the slums. She says I've grown accustomed. I even invited her here just to help her, but she said, "I won't even speak with those bitches." -No way. -What bitches? She means you, you, and you. You too! I bet she's all bark and no bite. No to that sweater. Don't let her walk over you, honey. I don't know, Hande. I'm barely keeping it together. I try to humor her, treat her like an older sister, but no. I said, "Sis, look..." See, I even call her "Sis" out of respect. "Everyone's nice around here, they'll protect you," I said. But she said, "They can all go to hell." Filthy girl. See you. I swear she's the Devil. She won't shut up about me. I don't know what her problem is. Hold on, I'm about to leave. If it weren't for Fatih, I wouldn't stay. I keep asking if she needs anything. I said, "Everybody is nice here, they'll help you out." She said, "Those assholes? No way." -Who does she think she is? -Ugh, new bride. Damn it, you're so unlucky. -What about the job application? -I'm walking over there to apply Maybe working will do me good. I'll have some new friends, maybe. I told her she could find such good friends. "Fuck them!" she yelled. For real, Sultan? That's insane. Shoo, shoo! Honey, this is my sister-in-law. Okay, I'll stay positive. I'm here. I'm so excited. Anyway, I'm hanging up now. Okay, I'll let you know. Bye! New bride, my ass. Oh, my beautiful mom! Did you miss your favorite? I've just finished knitting these. There you go. Just stop it. I have like eighty pairs. Anyway, Gizem sent me over. She insists on cooking dinner for us. She invited us over. No, she's a new bride. Let her rest for a few weeks. That's what I told her, Mom. I told her that there's no need and that she should rest. But she insisted. Maybe she feels like a loser. You know, after the glorious dinner I served, which was trending on social media. -I see. -I feel sorry for her. -Alright then, we'll go. -Oh, okay! -See you at dinner, then. -See you. Hold on, Mom. Come here. I love you. I made you a mother-in-law, don't forget that. -I know. -Alright. I want grandchildren. See you! -Shoo, new bride! -What the hell, man?! New bride! New bride! New bride! New bride... New bride... Isn't that Melahat's new daughter-in-law? -Is it heavy? -No. For God's sake... I'm having so much fun. Sis! Could we come over for dinner tonight? -I'm not available today. -Is that so? Yeah, I figured and told Mom you wouldn't want to anyway. To whom? Mom? Yeah, she sent me over. She wanted to have dinner at your place. I said, "Oh, Mom, her place must be in a terrible state right now. She has an underground casino there, they're playing cards constantly." "She can't cook as well as me," I said. -I told her you couldn't-- -No! Of course I can. Sure, you can come over. I'd love to if that's what Mom wants. -We'll be there, then. -Okay. -You're sure? -Yes. Okay then, bye bye, good luck. Hey. You know, there was this neighbor of one of our relatives... She wasn't like you, though. She was something else entirely. Right after the marriage, she had a fight with her mother-in-law. They got divorced right away. Just saying. I'm calm. I don't want to throw my sister-in-law in a pool full of acid. I don't. Because I'm a civilized person. And I'm going to cook something beautiful. Here we go. Okay, amazing. I'll just go shopping then. Oh, my God! Is your fridge empty? I feel sorry for you. -Delivery guy! -Yes, ma'am? -Can you come here silently? -Alright. Hey, stop! Don't move! -What's wrong, ma'am? -Um... Let's just talk without moving at all. I don't want the lights to turn on. -Why, though, ma'am? -Well... You see, the neighbor is a crazy lady. -I see. -She bites strangers. -Does she? -Yes, she bites hard. We don't know why. The wounds were awful. -Dear God. -Let's get this over with. -Alright, ma'am. -The light mustn't turn on. Be careful. Hand it over. -Okay, alright. -Let's just... -Can I use the NFC? -Do it already, dude. Is it done? -Lose the receipt. Send it over. -Here you go. Oh, did you order food? Run, save yourself! -Shoo! -What?! You shoo! I know exactly how to make a fool out of you. Loser. Alright. Very good. Perfect. #HURRAYFORTHENEWBRIDES What am I even doing? I'm going crazy. No need for that, it's nice. I'm going crazy. It's amazing. Sis, what a dinner. Seriously amazing. I swear. Thank you so much. Am I right? Yeah. I won't lie, honey, I didn't know you were such a good cook. It tasted restaurant-ish to me. It didn't feel handmade. Mom and Dad are accustomed to my amazing cooking, they must've found it strange. Not at all. Thanks so much, honey. It was delicious. Glad you liked it, Mom. -Oh, Dad wants salt. -No, not salt. He said, "I love dishes with meat and they're hard to cook. You did an amazing job." What else did you say? Oh, he added, "The amount of sauce was perfect. -Thanks, honey." -That's wonderful to hear. I'm really glad you liked it, but... I have to tell you something. -So-- -Just tell them. Tell them you ordered it. What's going to happen? Tell them you're just talentless and that's how God created you. Confess, come on. Tell them. Just tell them, come on. -No! -What? What's up? It's just... Is it salty enough? Mom, is it enough? -Yes, it's perfect, honey. -It's perfect. Let me tell you something. I was one of the best meat dishes I've ever had. -Right? -Yeah, mine too. -Right? -Yeah. -It was amazing. -You nailed it. I swear I couldn't have done it better. -I loved the rice. -Right, Sultan? -Exactly. -Are you full? -Yes, I had like three plates. -Nah, eat six plates. -The rice was perfectly cooked. -Shut up, Mom. -Bravo. -Did you use butter? -Yes, of course. -Mom cooks a mean rice, too. -I don't use grease either, you know. -Yeah, she does. -I cooked everything with butter. -Bravo. Wow, seriously. Let's stop now and continue this another day. We've grown tired of orzo after all these years. -It was a magic touch. -Don't look down on, Mom. -I loved it. -I have to go to the bathroom. -I stink of butter. -How did you cook the carrots? -Mom's rice or Gizem's rice? -Oh, the carrots? I just... I'll give you the recipe, I'll be right back. -Sultan. -Yeah? This is the kitchen. The bathroom is there. Is that so? I just got turned around, since they look alike here. Is this place the bathroom in the opposing flat or something? Stop messing around. Where is the trash from the order? Just tell me. I won't spit on you so much. Just a little, like this. Oh, come on, ma'am. What order are you talking about? -You're embarrassing yourself. -You think you're so smart, huh? You think you're going to fool me, huh? Moron. You're going to look like a fool in front of your in-laws when I find it. Mom! -Selim! -What happened? -Whoa! -Honey! -That was real?! -What happened? -You basically flew. -Are you okay, Sis? -The rug slipped. -Get up. -Get up! -I fell! -The rug slips. -Just glue it or something. -It hurt so much! -Yeah? Aw... -It was bad, yeah. -Get me out of here. -Okay, let's go. -The rug slipped and she fell. -Thanks for the food. -Just glue it down. -What if it were me? -No way, Mom. You wouldn't fall. Glue this rug down. Hamdullah, come on! You're still eating? You're like a vulture. -How did this happen? -It's the rug. Dad, everyone's leaving. Oh, whose husband is this? Oh, it's my husband The breadwinner My heart's owner My darling -What's up? -Everyone does it. -Who's everyone? -Just... everyone. Alright then. See you. -You're leaving? -Yeah. -Are you off to Mom's? -Yes, I am. See you, honeypot. -Let's not get divorced so soon. -Alright, okay. Shame on you. -I love you. -I love you too. -See you, booger! -Bye. Oh, whose husband is this? Oh, it's my husband What's up? Where are your pajamas? Yeah, I'm going to give them to you as a gift. I only wear satin. I'm allergic to cheap fabric. You know what I'm allergic to? Simple things. I'm so itchy right now. I hate it. You know... Snap out of it. Don't make faces at me. Oh, Mom! -Mom-- -Good morning. Good morning. I love this place. So spacious. Your first daughter-in-law has missed you very, very much, Mom. -Come in. -What a beautiful place. So spacious. -I made these for you. -For me? -Mom... -Fingers crossed. Thank you so much, they're beautiful. -Your new daughter-in-law loves you. -I love you too. -You're so beautiful. -Get the door. -So cute. -The door. They're beautiful. -Hallo. -Welcome. -Hi, Gizem. -Hi. We kiss three times. Sorry I couldn't come to your wedding or for a visit. No worries. They kiss three times in Germany. They were in Germany. They go there every summer. -Yeah, I work-- -She teaches German. -Yes. -Nice to meet you. Hülya's the best. She loves me. I love her back. We're besties, right? -Yeah, our neighbors are important to us. -How nice. -Let's go have breakfast. -Okay. -Your pie looks tasty. -Yeah. -Mom... -Yeah, Mom. -You forgot the homemade pastry. -You really like it? You forgot the most important dish. Anyway, I got it. It's okay. I have the handmade pastry. I got the handmade pastry, Mom. You look tired, honey. -Well, you know... -I'm tired too. We women suffer constantly. I got up this morning and I noticed that my hair was dry. I couldn't ignore it. I applied some oil. While I was doing that, I noticed that my nails weren't shiny. I removed the polish, then reapplied it. But I had to do my feet, too. I did that and then my back started aching. Well, I woke up at dawn. My kid had a fever, I brought it down. I gave him a bath. I washed and ironed his school uniform. I prepared for the new school year. You know, I work on weekdays. I vacuumed the apartment, cooked our week's meal, then I fixed the leaking sink, and then I remembered Melahat invited me over, so I baked some German pie and came here. It seems you're tired too, Hülya. There you go. Hülya, I assume you aren't married. -I'm not. I divorced him. -I'm so sorry. I'm not. I'm relieved. He didn't want to work, so I left his ass. He lives in Germany now. I don't care at all. I'm happy with my kid. -Is it a boy or a girl? -A boy. -What's his name? -Berk. Aw, how old is he? -Nine. -Yeah? So he's in fourth grade. -God bless him. -Have some sincerity. Hülya, you know, I want grandchildren. Songül's second grandkid had his teeth grown in by now. I do want to have kids, but I lost so much weight. Dresses wrap my body so nicely, and no offense, but my butt is rock-solid. I don't want to get all wobbly, so naturally I postponed it. -What about you? -I'm going to find a job first. You know, the unemployment rate is high. And I don't like sitting at home like a dork. You know, Hülya, I have so many followers now... It'd be hard to visit Dubai with a baby. You don't have that many views. -I get an insane amount of views. -I get triple the viewers. Maybe they wanted to watch a comedy. Yeah, because yours are horror movies. Melahat, your daughters-in-law get along so well. So well! They have an excellent friendship. -Oh! -You're ugly. It's the chandelier again. Your dad will handle it when he comes home. I'll take care of it, Mom. It's simple. -No, I'll do it, Mom. -You just fell last night, honey. -I'm the first daughter-in-law. -But I'm the newest one. They're so cute. Be careful, Sis. Don't fall down. Stop. -What do you know, you yokel? -I'll show you yokel. Shut up. Hülya, I'm so tired too. The place is so big, the chores are never over. Why don't you move to Ayvalık? You just bought a place there. Why live here and bother with the stairs? We will, and whoever gives birth first, will get this place. -Don't even think about it. It's mine. -I'm not going to give birth for a flat. You can't anyway. You're a loser. -I'm a loser? -Yes. -I'll make three just out of spite. -Go ahead, do it. -What? What's up? -What's up? -I'll gouge your eyes out. -Bring it on. -I will. -Do it. -Go away. -You go away. -Go away. -You go away. -Just-- -Mommy! Oh, God. Should I break it up? No, they're just playing around. -My foot! -I'll kill you. I will fix the damn thing! -Should we break it up? -They're just joking around. We're fine, Mom! Hülya, are they serious? -Let it go! -You let it go. Yeah, I'm kicking your ass. There's no place for brotherhood in the game. Watch how I get pregnant, Sultan. Honey, be careful with the rug. It slips. Selim insisted, honey. I didn't want to, but... No worries, babe. The sofa is comfy, right? We chose well. Hi, honey. What's... What's up, honey? -Did you put on red lipstick? -Yes, I did. So what? Nothing. You're so silly. Why put on red lipstick at night? Maybe I am silly. Weird... Is it warm in here? No. But something's making me sweat, that's for sure. Well, the gown doesn't look that warm. I guess it is, huh? Why did you bite it like that? You know, when I look into your eyes, I feel something heating up inside me. What do you think it is? Are you mad at me because I'm playing games? No, I'm just madly in heat. I love your goofiness the most. Thanks, I guess. Should we have a baby? -Right now. -Here? That'd be difficult. Wow. -"Wow?" -Read the signals, Selim. What are you after? -Rawr. -You know what? That was one of the most arousing moves I've seen lately. -Here? -In the bedroom? Here? But you wanted to get a job first, and-- -No. I want it. -You do? Okay. I want to breed as soon as possible. -Breed? Who says that? -Let's breed. -Come on. -Who says that? Hush. I'm uncomfortable with this, Gizem. Honey! What are you doing, Gizem? It's like my brother's watching me. You made me so uncomfortable. With my shoulder. Yeah. -Ouch! -Sorry, ma'am. Be careful, damn it! I got a concussion. -Thanks. -Come again. Oh? Yeah, it's just for a friend, and she... -Anyway, have a nice day. -Goodbye. -You? -You. Why are you here? -I was at the pharmacy. -Yeah? We needed toothpaste. -Where are you off to? -To the pharmacy. What are you getting, a pregnancy test? Um, mouthwash. Your necklace is crooked. I don't know, maybe you-- Your lipstick is smeared all over! Well, I guess it happens when you're trying to have a kid. It happens. Yeah. You know, honey, I don't like meaningless competitions, because I'm not you. Alright, ma'am. -See you. -"See you." Hypocrite. So windy... -Um, Sultan-- -How are you? I'm just fine, but... I guess the weird weather gets to people. Yeah, it's so weird, just the weather for going insane. It happens, yeah. It affects all of us. -Yeah, there are so few sane people. -You're right. -Yeah. -Anyway, I want... -What? -Um, a test... Antidepressants? Poor girl. What are you looking at? Is there something on my face? Something on my teeth? Um, my sister-in-law did this. Yeah. My bitch of a sister-in-law did it. She smeared it. Oh, that bitch. We ran into each other over there. Look, she's there! She's looking at us. See? -That bitch. -I'm sure she is. I'm sure. You'll get what's coming to you. You'll see. You'll see. What?! Sorry, Mom. What is it, dear? This evening? Okay. Who? Oh, Hayriye? Okay. Okay, Mom. We'll be there. No, it's just that it's so windy. I was frustrated. Hang on, Mom! Remember Hayriye's grandson? The one who was on the news, yeah. What was his name? Yes, Hüseyin. She should bring him over. We'll play with him. You know, Gizem is an educator. She'll like having a kid around. -He's so energetic! -Yeah. -Look at him. -So cute. -Be careful. -Yeah. -So energetic. -God bless. He won't stop. What was his name? -Hüseyincan Rıza. -Hüseyincan Rıza. Hüseyincan! Buddy, what are you doing? Just take a breath. -Come. -Calm down. -Fatih! -He's weird. Yeah, he's very vibrant. We saw him on the news, too. He's going to fall. You're so cute. Just sit down so I can hug you. -Come on. -Come on, just take a seat. Hüseyincan, come on, go near her. -Come on, Hüseyin. -You're going to be sick. You're making me dizzy, son. -How old is he? -He's almost eight. Oh, God bless. He looks younger. -Be careful! -Careful! -What are you doing? -That's an antique! -It's okay, calm down. -Don't make me chase you. -That's precious. -Fatih, stop, please. -Hold it from below. -Calm down. Hüseyin, please give that to me, honey. -Come on. -Just don't get too close. Look how he's staring you down. He loves you. Good job, Hüseyin! -There you go. -Bravo. -Good job. -The right way is to talk to kids. -It's important-- -Oh, God! -Let her go. -He's playing! It's just a joke. -No worries. -Leave her alone. -Let go, honey. -She's trained for this. Let go. Dude, let go. She's an educator. -Someone stop him. -Don't you dare. -Let go. -I'm uncomfortable. Good job, kiddo. No worries. It happens. He's just curious. You know, I studied education. He has to notice things, get curious, get excited. It's important-- -What the hell are you doing?! -Honey. -Stop staring! -Honey. Why are you staring at me?! Fatih, just let me go! Hold on! Who the hell do you think you are, huh?! My sister-in-law is getting her ass kicked by a kid right now. -Just take him away! -Hang on! What the hell are you doing?! -Take him! -Let me go! -Let me go! -Sultan, what are you doing? -Calm down! -You brat! -Take him! -Stop! Who do you think you are, you brat?! -Just leave me alone! -She just got her ass kicked. Hold him down! -Stop! -Calm down! My lovely wife, who was beaten up by a kid. -Did he beat you, honey? -It's not funny, Fatih. I love kids. How did I get so mad? Don't be hard on yourself. That kid beat his uncle with a crowbar. -What? -Yes, a crowbar. He was on the news and you didn't tell me? He went viral, everybody knows him. You type in "kid" and "crowbar," he comes up. Sultan told me she warned you. How was I supposed to know? Right. Sure. Sultan told me. I must've forgotten. He deserved to be yelled. Don't worry about it. -It's not his fault. -Whose is it? -His parents. -Right. Everyone who enables him is guilty. You are, too. -What did I do? -Drop it, Fatih. I'm already mad. Let's just not talk. -But-- -I don't want to talk. And she says she wants a kid. I don't want it anymore. I don't. -It wouldn't work anyway. -Why? We can do it. Not like that. Apparently I'm not ready. I'm just going to get a job. I'll think about it later. -I don't want it. -Okay. -I don't. -Okay. Can you get me a glass of water? -I don't want a kid. -Okay. Oh, my husband! I love you! Oh, my husband! What the hell? Oh! You normally take a lot longer. Sultan, are you okay? There's a mosquito under the bed. A mosquito? You call a mosquito your husband? No, dear. I was just yelling "You huge mosquito, you has-been!" Ew. -It was huge? -Yeah. It'll bite us at night. -Honey, but... -It's somewhere around here. Whatever. -What? -Are you going to sleep right away? It's late, honey. I'd better. Don't. Let's just hang. Hang? We did that before work this morning. So, yeah... But you're my bad boy. I mean, sure I am, but... I am, but... Be a bad boy, then. It's not like it's a tap, Sultan. -Whoa. -What's up? I'm just a bit cold. I'll warm you up. -You know... -Alright then. -Let me see the tap. -Alright, I guess. Are they fighting? I hope so. -Why? -I hope not. Good night, then. -Something on your mind? -No, it's just a bit hot. We should get an AC. -I changed my mind. Let's breed. -Yeah? Alight. OVULATING MY LOVE VIDEO CALL Gizem? LOGISTICS AND ECONOMICS COME EARLY Yay! Yes! We're not kids, you know. -Come on. -It'll be fun. We play this a lot. Come on, it's your turn. -Me? -Yes. -I'm putting it on. -Go ahead. -Here's the music. -Okay. -This is too easy. -Wow! Can you hear me? Mom says I'm her favorite. -Okay, he's set. -Let's start, honey. -Kangaroo. -Simple. Boogaloo. -So simple. -No, it's wrong. -It's wrong. -What? Put it back on. Look at me. Kangaroo. -Bungalow? -Kangaroo! -Look... Kan... -Lan... -...ga... -Langa? What's "langa?" -Kangaroo! -Lampoon? Just take it off. It's "kangaroo"! Why can't you tell? -Say "kangaroo" then! -That's what I did. -You didn't. -Come on. -It's our turn now. -No! We're playing, too. Oh, Mom wants in. -Yeah. -Hamdullah, come on. -Dad! -Come on, Dad. You open your mouth too wide. Dad, put the headphones on. -There's going to be music. -Yeah. Do you hear it? -He does. -Okay. Look at my mouth. -Trephone. -Trephone. -Wow. -Awesome. -Amazing. -We did it! -Wow. -Wow. -It's unreal. -You see how it's done? -It's our turn. -Here goes. -Here's the music. -Okay. -He'll fail. -There we go. You're going to be a dad. Your goats? You're going to be a dad. -Wow! -Yearly goals? -No. You are... -Your... -...going to be a dad. -My goals? -I did it. -No. -It'll happen. -No, it's wrong. -You're going to be a dad! -Going to be a dad? -Yes, you are! -You're going to be a dad? A dad... Oh, God! I'm going to be a dad! I'm going to be a dad! Dad, did you hear? What do you say? You're going to be grandpa. -Oh, God... -Congratulations, guys. -Congratulations. -Sultan! -Take a pic. -Sultan, take a picture of us, please. -Take one horizontally. -Yeah. Now a vertical one for the story. -Vertical. -Vertical! -Point to her belly. -Yeah, let's. It's done. -Okay. I think my eyes were closed. Can you take another one? -Amazing. -Congratulations, man! MIRACULOUS PLANTS FOR INCREASED FERTILITY -Hello. -Welcome. Yarrow, coltsfoot, shepherd's purse. Oh, I'm out of shepherd's purse. Hang on a minute. Wolf's scream, then. Never heard of it. -Sounds ridiculous. -Yeah, 'cause the others were so sensible. I just saw them on the Internet. -Let me check. -Okay. Oh, Sis! What brings you here? Um, I was just buying some spices. We're here to buy some nuts for my baby. Since I'm pregnant. Come here. I love you. I love you too. Oh, Mom. I love you. Sultan... -Your yarrow and coltsfoot. -What are those? Oh... It's just... -I just wanted some cinnamon. -Cinnamon? -Yeah. -I'll get some. Oh, Sis, should we get some "fox den" as well? Mom, did you get it? What a pun! Oh, my baby... Let's go, then. Let's go, honey. Mom, since I'm pregnant, I should be careful with the stairs. God forbid... Ouch. I could've fallen. Here's the cinnamon. That's everything. Give it here. Thanks. Here's your money. What kind of music is this? This is a spice shop! Who do you love so much even? Did you break up with the date palms? Did you fall for a dried apricot? Huh? Hey. No, she's not pregnant. Not pregnant! Not pregnant! Not pregnant! Not pregnant! Not pregnant! Not pregnant! Not pregnant! Let's just skip the herbs. "Making a young boy jump on a bed is a method for getting pregnant." This is ridiculous. Have a nice day. Bestie! What are you two doing here? You're so cute. I just saw something on the Internet. It's a tradition or something. It says if you make a young boy jump on your bed, your husband will earn a lot of money. So I yelled "Selim! Let's find us a boy and make him jump on our bed!" -You know, for prosperity. -You need a boy to jump on your bed? Maybe, I mean... if he wants to. Berk, would you like to jump on Sultan and Selim's bed for prosperity? No. Wow, he said it so well. Just "No." What a cutie. Whatever, it's not that I believe it. I just saw it and thought maybe it'd work. See you. No, that won't work. "Run three circles around your husband and on each lap, lock eyes with him and say 'Assalamu alaikum.'" Ridiculous. Who comes up with these? No way. So ridiculous. I'm so hungry. Enjoy it, honey. Thanks, honey. Oh, there's potato salad, too. Assalamu alaikum. Alaikumu assalam. Assalamu alaikum. Alaikumu assalam. Assalamu alaikum. -Allah help me... -Calm down. -Bismillah... -Selim, no. -Don't come near me. -Stop. -Calm down. -Stay away! Ouch. Oh, honey. But, I mean... Why would you do something like that? Why did you throw the saltshaker? I was scared to death. I thought you were possessed by a demon or something. I mean, you ran around the table, stopped to say "Salaam alaikum," looked at me, then ran another lap, looked at me again. I said, "Alaikumu assalam," yet you didn't even register it. You just kept running. I was scared. Okay, just drop it, Selim. I saw it on the internet. Maybe we shouldn't rush it, honey. Am I right? Just let it happen when it happens. Let the baby choose when. -It'll tell us-- -You watch too many TV dramas. You just got over your fears anyway. Don't go there, Selim. Please. Alright then. I'll just go brush my teeth. You speak too slowly, Selim. Okay, I'll just go brush my teeth. You just warm your feet here. "Don't rush it, honey." We'll see how you feel when she gives birth. God... Come on, this is too big! Oh, hubby! Oh, hubby! I love you! I can't believe this! Please, Fatih, don't insist! This ring is too big! I can't wear this around! Stop! What are you doing, honey?! Are you okay? -Why? -Is it the hormones? Oh, that. It's just... nothing. We have a game going on between us, Sultan and I. It's a joke. -So you're on good terms? -Of course we are. She's like my sister. I can't believe you, hubbity. Alright then. My lawyer will call in the morning. -Can you get us a glass of water? -Of course. SULTAN - I'M SO BEAUTIFUL TODAY GİZEM - PREGGIE MORNING -Drive safely. -Okay. Kiss my forehead. -Kiss me on the forehead. -Why? -Just do it. Make sure you don't sweat. -Why would I? It's cold. -Okay. Don't forget to eat this. -Alright. -Morning. -Morning. -You want some? -No, thanks. -Sis? -No, thanks. -It's handmade. -No. Have a nice day. -Have a nice day, Daddy. -Daddy loves his baby. I love you. I love you too. Sultan, hey. It's just... There was this daughter-in-law of our neighbor... She wasn't like you, though. She was so fine. She couldn't bear children and they got divorced in a heartbeat. -And? -Just saying. -Yeah? -Yeah. Anyway, bye bye. If Sultan were to tell me she's pregnant, I'd just lose it. -I'd go crazy. -It will happen. You know what? She doesn't fear it as much nowadays. Yeah. Maybe it won't happen again. Now that Gizem's pregnant, they'll spend a lot of time together and she'll get over it. I hope so. Off you go. The ball is in the penalty area, the match almost over. The referee looks at his watch, here comes an offensive! He shoots... and goal! Goal! As if he's saying "I'm here! It's not over until I say so!" He bolted it right in! What a goal! An amazing shot! Beautiful! -Fatih, just... -Alright. -Okay. -Look. It's beautiful, Mom. -Oh, honey. -Mommy. What? They're celebrating! He says, "Lower the volume, we aren't deaf, you know." -Come on. -Alright. -Okay. -I will. -He's getting mad. -Just lower it. Alright already! What a goal! The entire bench is... -What is this? -What's going on? -What's this? -What... For God's sake, what is this? -Strange. -What is this, Sultan? -What are they doing? -It's funny. That one's the boy, this one's the girl. Look at that belly dancing. She's entertaining us. -It's like a wedding. -Looks fun. -Let's watch it, then. -She's playing the music on her phone. What is this? Dear God! I'M PREGNANT What does it say? -I can't read. -Does it say "pregnant"? -She's pregnant. -Yes. -"I'm pregnant." -Wow! Are you pregnant? -Wow! -See, I knew it! -She's pregnant! -Yay! You're pregnant! -Congratulations, guys. I'm so happy. -God, this is amazing! -I'm going to be a dad. -Congratulations. -I can't believe it. -Let's take a pic. -The whole family. -Alright. -Take a picture of us. -I can't. Just take it. -Just us. -Okay. -I can't unlock... -Come on, a pic with our baby! -You two too. -Go ahead. -Come on. -Let's all say "God bless." God bless! -Okay, done. -Take one horizontally. Yeah, please, Sis. -I'm not bothering you, am I? -Of course not. I just tutored three kids in a row, now I'm just having fun plowing snow. Cool. You know, I'm four-weeks pregnant. -Yeah. -When Gizem found out about hers, hers was also four weeks old, so it's now eight weeks old. Amazing! So we have a four-week difference, that means a month by my calculation. In order for me to give birth first, it has to be a girl. Because as you know, girls arrive earlier. We all know that. So if hers is a boy, he'll arrive late. So I still have a shot. -How about you both give birth on time? -But I'm the first daughter-in-law. My child must be the first grandkid, and I'll get the place. I mean, I can't live in a two-bedroom flat like a loser when my sister-in-law lives in a huge apartment. Am I right? Naturally mine will arrive sooner. The first grandkid is going to be my kid for sure, right? -How long was your pregnancy? -My son arrived on time. Nice. I was worried for a second. -I'll just go then. -You do that, yes. I HOPE IT'S A GIRL! WHAT A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY! WHAT A WEDDING IT WAS! HOME SWEET HOME! MORNING, GIRLS! DR. SERKAN CANSEVDİ AT WORK, ANOTHER BABY ARRIVES AT DAWN! I'm Dr. Serkan Cansevdi. In the long and tedious journey of life, every baby deserves a good start. For a million likes, choose Cansevdi Clinic.

I live so far away, though. I'm carrying a life here. I'll just wait. You look lovely. Hello, um... I'm nine-weeks pregnant. I was told I couldn't get an appointment. Yes, that was me. Okay. Well... Can I just talk to him? I'm sure he'll want me. He doesn't decide based on looks, ma'am. He's too busy. He has a birth today, then he has a birth tour in Dubai. Alright then. I'll just wait there. -Okay then. -You! I can't believe you. You just can't stop copying me, can you? Why would I copy you? I was his fan already. You think you will get an appointment? -You won't, that's for sure. -Blah, blah. Stop mocking me or else. -Look... -It's him! Sir, please... Cansevdi I can't believe it! -He's really here!

Come on, hurry. -He's amazing! -So cute! Alright, let's see. There it is. Let's hear the heartbeat. Doesn't look like you got pregnant simultaneously. -Yeah. -Nah, just a few days. -Let's check yours. -Okay. It's big, it'll catch up. -It was so huge. -Post a lot of pics on Instagram, girls. #SistersGivingBirthAtTheSameTime. -#AtCansevdiClinic! -#BigBabyComingAtCansevdi! -#AtCansevdi! -Yeah. I can't believe it. -Fatih. -Yeah? -I have a two-millimeter baby. -Tell me about it. Mine's ten millimeters. Looks just like me. It's ten millimeters, how can you tell? See, it's just like me, tall and slim. -Hold it sideways and it'll look like me. -Yeah, it does. You weirdo. -God... -Sultan? Why didn't you wait for me today? He's so popular. He doesn't have time. We told him we're sisters, that's how we got in. Well, you are like sisters. -Well, sure... -Of course, but... -Not that... -Not exactly, but as a joke... -Like a joke... -Sure, we're family, but not sisters. But I would've liked to be there, because-- But Selim, you know what the doctor said? He said, "What a huge baby! Looks like he's going to catch up!" God bless. No, wait. When did he say that? I didn't hear that. Yeah, you didn't. I told him that we're both tall, and-- -Hang on. Fatih. -Yeah? He told me that ours is going to be so active. Then he checked some more and told me it's going to be smart. -He did? -And the baby kicked at the clinic! -It did? -It even punched! icks, punches... What a punk. -How did it do that even? -It even punched! Did you hear, Mom? It's kicking and all. I bet they did. You know what the doctor said, Mom? He told me it looks like I'm going to give you your first grandkid. -Wow. -She's kidding. -Hormones. -Must be. Maybe one will be a girl and the other a boy! Well, diversity is cool. I'd like that. -Dad's saying something. -Yeah? -As long as they're healthy. -He said, "As long as they're healthy." He literally said it. I love this room. Look how peaceful it feels. We have a lot of room here. You can raise the babies here. -Yes, that'd be great! -Yes, that'd be great! I mean, as long as it's healthy, I don't want anything else, Mom. I hope it will be. Mom, you should see how Selim gets. He's so emotional nowadays. The other day I had a dream. You know, a pregnant woman's dreams are basically prophecies. I enter the living room and see Selim just sitting there. I say "I've never seen you read a book." He doesn't. He jumps up and throws the book away. I say "Hey!" He has this robe on, like the ones Arabs wear. He calmly glides towards me. Then he gets very energetic and starts dancing. He comes closer. "What are you doing, Selim?" I say. He suddenly notices me. But he looks just like you. You know how I always say that. Then he lands, comes closer and says... My miraculously beautiful wife... "...is going to gift me a baby, huh?" Then he says... A new baby... "...means a new home." Or something like that. Then he runs away. A new home? He either said "home" or "hole," but it sounded like "home" to me. I think he yelled "A new home," and then he ran away. I hope it's a good sign. -I hope. -Mom, Fatih is no different. I too had a dream the other day. Maybe Fatih told me things that he couldn't in person. In the dream, I am in the kitchen. I just baked a wonderful pie. What a cake, though. Then, suddenly, Fatih comes towards me. He has a shiny jacket on. I mean, not that shiny, but satin or something. His hair was so long, too. Maybe it means discomfort or something. But he gets overjoyed when he sees me. He looks like he's about to dance. Then he just slams the wall. He bangs his head, then turns. He says, "What did I do to deserve to have such a happy wife and a kid? I took you from your home and brought you to this crowded city, but you, you... You're giving this family their first grandkid. Do you realize that?" Then he tells me I deserve the best of everything, and starts shaking and crying. Oh, come on. You see, since I'm making him a dad, I think he's so happy but he can't show it. Of course it's something else entirely to give such a wonderful, happy family their first grandkid. Naturally, it's a big deal. You don't know that. -Well, I got pregnant first. -Well, I was right after. -Well, mine was the first seed. -Well, my ovaries shined right after. Well, my egg was the first to cook. I love listening to your chatter. You're both going to be beautiful moms When you hold it in your arms... and when you smell that wonderful smell... BOY - GIRL WELCOME, MY BABY BOY OR GIRL VOTE NOW IS IT A GIRL? IS IT A BOY? Hello. -Hi. -You look beautiful. Really? Alright, let's count down. Come on, three, two... Fatih! -What color is it? -I'm going to have a nephew! -I'm going to be a dad! -Come here! We're here! I'm going to be the first. Yeah, right. SULTAN - 15 WEEKS GİZEM - 19 WEEKS Come here, Selim. Get over here. What is it? -What's up? -Something weird happened. -About the baby? -No, nothing like that. -I was just sitting around. -Yeah? I suddenly got inspired. I didn't know what to do with it. -So I wrote a poem. -A poem? -Give me the notebook. -You wrote it down? Yeah. -Listen. -Okay. It's so weird. I am, and you are You are, and I am From me and from you, Selim This baby is ours and with you, I am Mine is yours and yours is mine 2019, Yeşilköy, Sultan. Amazing. That might be one of the most emotional poems I've ever heard. I know. -Oh, honey... -Do you want me to read it again? Read the part with "From you." -The emotional part? -Yeah. Okay. I am, and you are You are, and I am -From me and from you, Selim -From me and from you, Selim Think about it. In a year or two, she's going to run to you, hold you by your shoulders, look into your eyes, and recite you a poem that goes, "Daddy, you're my hero. You know that, right?" I feel so emotional. She's really going to say all that? Hero and all? Well, her mom's a poet. Oh, God... -God, I'm going to cry. -Stop it, honey. You're overreacting. Come back. Here I am! My son wants ice-cream, huh? What's up? It's nothing. -Why are you crying, honey? -I just saw the most emotional video. Come on, honey. We talked about this. I told you not to watch such videos. You're pregnant. Did you watch another birth video? No, I didn't. It was about a robot they built in Japan. -And? -It like... It gets up and has difficulty walking, then it falls down. -I felt so sorry. -For the robot? -Did I stutter, Fatih? Yes, for the robot. -Okay, I understand. It gets up, falls down, then looks up, and smiles. -For God's sake... -I am so sad right now. Who wouldn't be? Just think about it. Our little boy will also fall down after taking his first steps. -Come on. -He will. Then he will look up towards you and go, "Daddy, daddy!" I would never let him fall down. -Let me see the video. -It's the worst. It tore my heart to pieces. It really did. Look, it falls and smiles. -Yeah... -It's smiling. -Sure. -It shattered my heart, Fatih. -You want ice-cream? -Yes. -What's this? -There you go. Fatih, I didn't want this. I wanted cacao and mixed. Okay, I'll just go buy some. I don't want it anymore. You got my least favorite. -Bro? -Hey, bro. I can't see you anymore because of all the flowers. You know how Sultan gets when she starts decorating. Your new newspaper rack looks very nice. Yeah, it fits the other furniture, too. We love it. I'm glad you do. We're thinking about changing the tufts on the drapes. They don't fit well. -What color are they? -It's like... -Like a reddish purple. -Damson. -Yeah, damson. -A heavy color. Right? We're thinking pale pink. -Pale pink would be perfect. -It would complement the white dresser. -It'd make the dresser stand out. -Yes, it would. Yeah. I had no idea how important drapes are. Yeah, and the tuft... It just completes the drape Laced rustic ones are the best, though. -Golden. -Exactly. Bro, I'm not okay. Let's go play soccer or something. I beg you, let's yell and scream. I'm so glad you said that. Dude, what's happening to us? This is not us. The guys won't even call anymore, because we haven't been going. -For God's sake... I'm so bored. -Alright, hold on. I have an idea. -Good morning. -Good morning. So, like I said, since eggplants contain nicotine, we don't want any dish that includes them to be cooked. -Morning, honey! -Good morning. This is our dad Fatih. Oh, you mean... I'm interviewing midwives. Just trying to find out who will get to be with us at the birth and the following three months. I had no idea. I'm so happy. You are? Really? -Anyway, if you'll excuse me... -Alright, see you, Daddy! Bye! So, yeah... So many midwives. Excuse me. -Is she out yet? -We're waiting too, son. I have experience with quadruplets. -How is that possible even? -There were four nannies. What is the one thing you don't like at a birth? They scream too much. I mean, just do it. So unnecessary, right? -I mean, we all did it. -Right. -Do you like kids? -No, I hate them. -How lovely. Why not? -I just don't. Talk about yourself a bit, please. -I see. Do you speak our language? -Thank you. No, thank you. -Do you have experience? -I looked after my sister's son, my brother's son, my uncle's daughter, my sister-in-law's daughter, my other sister-in-law's son, my neighbor's nephew... So, yeah, I do. But I don't like it. I'm sick of it, honestly. Please tell me a bit about yourself. Everything you need is on the form. You can read it, ma'am. I will make you give birth. Then I will take care of the baby. It's my specialty. Give me five babies and I'll take care all of them. Is that so? -I have a question if you're available. -I'm so available. Alright, awesome. So, when Melahat Lila is born, we're going to do a photo shoot. Like, with a newborn photographer. Let me just show you my favorite. -Hang on. -Multiply this... Here. It tears me up. Anyway, what was I saying... Picture a basket in your mind. Did you do it? Melahat Lila is inside the basket. She's sleeping. Next to her, there are rows of actual chicken eggs. They're not even cold yet. In between them, there's hay. It's going to cost a lot but it's worth it. And right in the middle, this is the surprise part... there's an actual, live, docile chicken. So it's as if Melahat Lila is a newly-hatched little chick. Surprise! Someone shut me up. I just get inspired somehow. I bet it's going to be huge on Instagram. What do you think? See? He was so moved. It's unbelievable. Must be the hormones. I'm, like, super intelligent. Oh, Selim's here. We're going to a workshop that's very important for Lila's health. Does it have to be poolside? Don't be like that. Don't you want us to have poolside pictures, Daddy-o? If you call me "Daddy-o" one more time, I swear I'll get a fake passport and flee the country. -Yeah? -I'll disappear. -Really? -You'll see. Come on, Fatih. Just enjoy it. Is he a good photographer? I hope he's calm and quick. Fatih-- -Is it him? Is it? -Hang on. -Continue! -Let's go. For God's sake, come on. Stop posing. We're leaving. And gentlemen! Spread your arms like they're wings and just like a bird would, hold the mother and the baby under your wings. Let's do it. Splendid. Just like that. Also, simultaneously, you can make any sound you want. Why, you ask? Because you're whichever bird you want to be and you're free to make any sound you want. Let's hear it. Come on. Make a sound. -Sultan, I don't think I get it. -Just do it. -Why, though? -He's coming, come on! Can we talk for a minute? Of course, sir. I get it. It's hard. It's scary. Does the burden of having people under your wings scare you? Actually, no. It doesn't scare me, but... -I see. -But, you know... I just don't get the sound thing. Everything sacred is loud. And birth is a sacred phenomenon, right? Birth is. Let's spread those arms. There you go. -Do you feel it? -Kind of, I guess. And you know what to do now. Go ahead. -I'll fly. -Sure. Don't stop. Yes, beautiful. Just like that. Continue. Yes. Continue. Bravo! -Fatih! -God damn it. -What are you doing here? -You scared the shit out of me. -You sure know how to make an entrance. -You look like a private investigator. Oh, you had a fight -and you don't want to go home. -No. -Just let it slide. She's pregnant and-- -Bro, we didn't have a fight. I'm just looking into our finances. -What for? -Well, you know... With all the things she asks for, I'm stretched thin. I see. Makes sense. The baby shower, the gender reveal... the private hospital... the nanny, and so on... Let's hope this baby doesn't bankrupt me. They say babies bring prosperity, but I don't know. You only do this stuff once. Try not to worry about it. -You're right. -Just please her as much as you can. Bro, of course I will. It's impossible to say no anyway. But I'm not so sure if we need the most expensive version of everything. That's what I'm questioning. We're going to be dads. Yeah. -I can't believe it. -He's going to be amazing. I'm going to have a tiny daughter. Oh, do you have tiny feet, too? I have tiny feet and a cute neck! Oh, I'll just eat that neck up! -My beautiful neck! -How cute! -It's beautiful! -Yeah! Cute neck, yay! -Dude, what floor is he on? -I don't know, bro, -but he's disgusted with us. -Yeah. SULTAN - 35 WEEKS GİZEM - 39 WEEKS Look at that. -She looks amazing. -What a wonderful woman. -Can we chat for a bit? -Sure, babe. Do we really need another person... living here? I'm not sure. What are you saying, Fatih? Honey, you're going to get me a diamond ring when I give birth, right? Of course, honey. -Slowly... -Alright. -Ouch. -Be careful. It's just that... Fatih bought Gizem a diamond ring when she got pregnant. -He did? -I wonder where he found the money. So I'm spending too much? Is that what you're saying? You want a baby shower, but it has to be in a hotel. -Yeah. -You'll give birth at a private hospital, but you insist on a suite, you even want to serve guests. -Yeah. -Now you want a babymoon? I don't even know what that is. It says "vacation for the pregnant." Honey, you struggle going to the kitchen or the bathroom as it is. Should we calm down a bit? -You think so? -I don't know. So, I changed, right? Wow. For God's sake... Sultan was right after all. About what? Never mind, it's nothing. She told me... that you don't have enough money to buy me nice things anyway. That I shouldn't dream about a babymoon. Whatever, never mind. She said that? -And Fatih told Gizem that... -What? He told her that the big flat is rightfully theirs since the first grandkid will be their son, and that you're so sly because you've just gotten me pregnant even though we've been married for years in order to get the big flat. -Which one's the big flat? -Mom's place. Fatih said this? Yes. Apparently, Selim told her that you married in a hurry just to get a flat for free, that you got me pregnant in a hurry in order to get the big flat, and so much more. Anyway, just forget it. He thinks I'm after the flat? Did Selim say this? Yes. He even danced around, singing, "The big flat is ours!" He danced like a gypsy, apparently. Just to spite you. Are you messing with me? Anyway, don't try talking to him. Keep this between us. I don't want you to fight over something like this. My husband can buy me a diamond ring and a flat if he wants to. -For sure. -Yeah. My husband ain't no loser. My husband ain't no pushover. Just forget it. Don't think about it. Don't fight over this. Forget it. We'll just live in this itsy bitsy flat. Melahat Lila, you, and I. Don't worry about it. I don't care about this stuff. Good night, babe. How could he? He's supposed to me my brother. We'll just make do. BIG BRO Thank you. Goodbye. Sir. HOME SWEET HOME WELCOME -Good evening. -Good evening, bro. -Hey, Selim. -Hey, Sultan. The dinner is ready. I'm going over to Hülya's. Mom said they're on the way and they'll be late. That's all. There you go. Hi, honey. Bro... Gizem's not home either. Can we talk for a minute? Sure, Fatih. I was just about to ask you myself. I'm glad you asked. Hi, bestie. -How are you? -We were just chatting with Gizem. Oh, yeah? I'll brew some tea. What's up, loser? Are you trying to steal my bestie? First of all, Hülya loves me. Anyway, my mood is ruined now. I'll just leave the three of you alone. Three of us? Hülya, you, and the bag under your eye. -Can I get you anything? Take a seat. -I'm good, thanks. -Fatih-- -Bro, the marriage wasn't a scheme. I met Gizem, I fell in love with her, and decided to get married. -I know. -So, Mom told me the flat is available. She said I shouldn't pay rent unnecessarily. Dude, I know. Why are you telling me this? What's gotten into you? Seems like you've forgotten how you look. You look like a fat caterpillar. -You goggly-eyed caterpillar. -Oh, honey. I haven't gained any weight. I look like a model. Don't be jealous. -You're so jealous. -Yeah, yeah. You said that. You told her that I've been living for free for years, and that I got Sultan pregnant just to get the big flat. Do you really believe I would say that? Do your baby shower at home. We'll make a bulgur salad instead of cupcakes. With roasted chickpeas and-- -I'll be the first! -The flat is mine! -In your dreams! -Piss off, you idiot! -In your dreams! -You're the idiot! -Just walk away! -Go away! -Shut up! -I swear-- -Shut up! Enough! Is this how you speak to each other? -It's her, not me. -Is this a game to you? Did you get pregnant just to boast? -You got me wrong, see-- -I held it in for so long. This has nothing to do with hormones. Big flats and shit. Instead of prioritizing your children's health, their education, their self-confidence, their happiness, their manners... you keep blabbering about baby showers, Instagram, followers! Shame on you two. I can't deal with this. Get the hell out of here. Hülya... Wow... I... Why would I say such a thing? -Take the flat, take everything! -Bro, you take it! You're my brother! We aren't like that and you know it! Oh! Gizem, tell him how Sultan told you that we're just having a baby to get the big flat. -Oh, that? I... That was-- -Sultan? -Did you say that? -Of course not. She told me that her husband bought her a diamond ring and that you couldn't have bought one. I didn't buy her a diamond ring. Did you say so? -Did you? -But she told me... that they're better off than us, and that I couldn't have a baby shower. Do you want us to fight or something? For God's sake! We're a family. I swear I'm just holding back because you are pregnant. -I'm leaving. -Bro, hang on. Don't go. -Bro! -Selim... -Fatih... -Shame on you, Gizem. Just look at us. -Your fight has poisoned the family. -Hold on. Bro! Bro? -Fatih! -Bro. -Bro? -Fatih... Gizem? I think my water broke. It's okay. -Hold on. -It's too soon. I'll take you to the hospital. -Let's just sit and wait. -Calm down. No, Sis. Please. Let's go to the hospital. I'll call Selim on the way, okay? Calm down, breathe. We'll be there in a second, girls. -It's too soon. -Baby, look. I'm here for you, okay? Don't you worry. -Look, Gizem. -Yeah, Sis? My mother died at childbirth. Look after her if something happens to me. Sultan, shut up, please. Don't talk like that. Let's keep the bad thoughts away. Come here. Don't think about that. Stay positive. -Think about nice things, okay? -If something's going to happen, -please, let it happen to me. -No, Sultan! Nothing's going to happen. Didn't the doctor tell you? -Tell me what? -He said she'll be just fine. He did, right? No, I said that. Yeah, you're right. Don't you worry a bit. We're both going to have our babies. They'll play together, grow up together... Alright? Oh, Sis! You got the big flat, Sis! For God's sake... You two are so cute. Sorry, girls. -I'll get the door. -Come here. Sis! Sis, I talked to him! They're on their way. You can do this. The baby is coming! I can't let you in, ma'am. Can't I be there for my sister? Sis... -Oh, Sultan... -She's so cute. -Is she really ours? -No, she's mine. She's Mommy's girl. -She's mine. -Look at her feet. -How did we make such a thing? -Remember that night with the "rawr"s? -For God's sake... -What? It's true. Hello, Mom and Dad. -Hi, Doc. -Hi, Doctor. Will she be in there for a long time? Hi, Selim! Oh, Sultan... -She's so beautiful, God bless. -God bless. -God bless her. -God bless her. -God bless her. -She has hair. -Right? -Oh, Doc. -Hi. -Hello there. -Hi. How's my niece? -She's perfectly fine, thank God. You'd get at least ten thousand followers if you delivered the same day. She's almost there, we're waiting. I swear I'm going to do it if she doesn't soon. Oh, you... -Yeah, it's hard. -Yeah. -Yeah... -See you. Honey, it wasn't that funny. -Something's happening. -What? -My water just broke. -What now? -Fatih, my water just broke. -Your water... Her water broke, Doctor! -Calm down. -Where did he go? Doc! -Calm down. -You okay? Calm down. -I love you. -Fatih! I caught him! Such a coincidence! I was here for another birth. -It's destiny, I guess. -I'm so glad I hired you! SULTAN - MY DAUGHTER AND MY SISTER GİZEM - MY SON AND MY SISTER What's up, buddy? -This is the most liked one, Sis. -Yeah, Sis. Break it up, you two! I'm getting jealous over here. So, it looks like it's your turn now. Everyone doesn't have to have children, I guess. -I guess. -You okay, honey? Yeah, Dad. Thanks. You have to think about the fall of the stock prices, Uncle Hamdullah! You said the same about Bitcoin. I'm all for digital platform stocks. What did Satoshi Nakamoto say? He said that Exodus was the best, am I right? Good job, Fatih. You're going to be a caring father. Thank you, Hande. I have to learn all about it. These two are founding a company. What? What company, Gizem? -Doorstep decoration and-- -Creative kids' rooms. You can sell my knitting, too! And we'll cook! -I'm taking classes. -Good for you. -Really? -There we go! -He farted. -Oh, you! In only four minutes. It's a record. -His mom would've done it in two minutes. -Sure, Dad. So, Melahat, I assume you aren't moving to Ayvalık? No way. I can't leave my grandkids. So, the big flat stays with you. -Can you pick it up? -Okay, I got it. Hang on. Oh, it's Yavuz! -Video call? -Yes. Is it Yavuz? -Come on, everyone. -Come, honey. -Here we go. -I'm answering it. Here goes. -Oh, Yavuz. Look, honey. -Hey! -Hi, all! I can't wait, I'm coming to see my niece and nephew. -Sure. -Come. -Of course. -This is your home, too. -I won't be coming by myself, though. -What? I'm getting married too! -Congratulations! -Yavuz? Uncle's getting married! Who's the unlucky girl? -Hush, she's in the shower. -In the shower? -Dude, don't just walk in there. -Honey! Let me introduce you to my family. They're on the phone. Say hi. I can't deal with bitchy moms right now. Just go away. Get up. Let's just move away, people. Let's get up, son. Did she call us bitchy moms? Damn right she did, Sis. THE END Girls, I don't mean to brag, but... It's as big as your head. For God's sake... Let me just polish it with my spit. I'll get it this time. See, when I lick it... So heavy. And this one? I can't hold it up. So heavy. And this one? Look. I can do it, I swear. Where do I go from that? -The gown. -The gown, okay. You know, our neighbor's daughter... She wasn't like you, though. She was so beautiful. She had a bad honeymoon... Come on, man! You're making me laugh! Cut! The camera is ready. Two... They're gone. Cut. Let's take five. Every single part of your face is too big... Why are you even laughing? You shouldn't have, man. You got her going. Mom's rice or Gizem's rice, Dad? And then I remembered Melahat invited me over, so I baked some German pie... -I'm so sorry. -You were so close. I was so good! Be careful, damn it! -Stay away! -Ouch. Dude, why are you laughing? Come on, man! I mean, you ran around the table, stopped to say... Cut! She's going to run to you, hold you by your shoulders, look into your eyes, and recite you a poem that goes, "Daddy, you're my hero. You know that, right?" Oh, whose husband is this? Oh, it's my husband The breadwinner My heart's owner My darling It's my husband My husband!
