Oh Oh Oh could you mummy how could you be a party to such a thing mothers don't do to their children what you're doing to Gloria blackening their characters in front of the entire world you are unaware of the neglect that has been going on Consuela this unfortunate child has been dying and Gloria has paid no attention to it that's ridiculous to hear you talk you think she was Little Orphan Annie how can you say the kid's been neglected she's never been left alone a day in her life from the day she was born she's either been with you or with that crazy nurse or with Gloria aren't you the one to talk about neglect you never considered it neglect when you left your children scattered all over Europe when Thelma and glory are little you never went near them for months at a time the child will be better off with Gertrude that is a proven fact ask the dr. Sandler on that Oh Kruger would jump through a flaming hoop if Gertrude snapped I think isn't told him to ah maybe it's vengeance is that it mama you never have forgiven Gloria for not letting you live with her anymore years ago into the streets she threw me her own mama into a very charming perfectly adequate flat right down the street from her in Paris all expenses paid is where she threw you mama let Gloria withdraw her petition if she doesn't want her shame to be broadcast for all the world to see you're just determined to drag her name through the mud aren't you look who's talking about mud you are not a leak on that add up a colored man he's a prince mama hasn't it occurred to you yet that you might have a lot to lose to are you forgetting the Thelma Gloria support you to the tune of $500 a month I see that this is a threat it's okay you can threaten I don't care if they can give me my check for this month I won't need their money anymore how are you going to live is no business of yours it's obvious how she's going to live Gertrude right mommy Gertrude will support you from now on won't she in return for you doing her dirty work for her isn't that right my lips are sealed at least said soonest mended mama please don't go ahead with this awful thing a child belongs with its mother any child any mother no matter what you say you love glory we'll think what this'll do toward we're all life publicity alone we'll be horrible for her I can never face my God if I don't do this good truth I am pleased to see you out of your widow's weeds so soon are you really I thought you might have wished that my devotion to Harry's memory would have approximated your devotion to father's Oh hardly my dear can I get you anything well a new heart would not be unwelcome tell me what do you hear about what was it that awful gossip columnist called her after Reggie died ah the world's most beautiful Widow I gather you haven't been reading the newspapers recently heavens no I'm ill enough as it is I'm afraid Oriya recently overstepped even her own extremely questionable boundaries North another panelist European Prince surely no this time she's seen fit to involve herself in a lurid much publicized liaison with a married man named Blumenthal I think it's fair to presume the gentleman is of the Hebrew persuasion good truth your own life has not been without its indiscretions my private life has never been lived for the sake of the newsreel cameras I have never been the source of scandalized amusement of the masses nor have I caused a whisper of public embarrassment for the family it's long since time she was called to account for her responsibility to the Vanderbilt name all of that notwithstanding I've been generous to her in my will there's plenty of time in the next world for accounting plenty of Gertrud says she knew nothing about it she says the first she heard of it was when I called her that's not so the first she heard of his when she cooked it up with your mother and her legal eagles Cochran Dunnington you think so I know so I have my sources now Gertrudis paying Dunning foods FINA represent your old lady excuse me your mother what forgive me for saying this but you've got something other than agree it asked for 30 Whitney this is the last time I'm gonna allow her to treat me in this appalling passion she may be one of the richest women in America and she may be used to getting whatever she wants whenever she wants it but she is not gonna take my child away from me she created any problems about glory having this vision with you no glory is coming tomorrow for the rest of the week but you sure didn't like it I can tell you that no Gloria if I remember correctly this situation is from going on now for about two years yes and it started when you left little Gloria with Gertrude after the tonsillectomy right and then you went back to Europe my first fatal mistake oh I regret it now well no I want her back with me for good well clearly if you're taking a little girl two years ago kept it for yourself they're right here in New York I stopped just going back and forth business into Europe things would have been hunky-dory for you now well however what slipped into it I guess at first I didn't want to cause any problems in the family because of Alice she was so ill and I didn't want to upset her she's always been so good to me in Wow little Gloria was just surrounded completely by all these lawyers and doctors who kept telling me to leave her where she was with Gertrude and how healthy she was and how good the country air was for her how many friends she'd made and on and on and on like that I believed them I trusted them they all just tricked me is what they did even my own mother's turned against me and she's siding with Gertrude Richie's been dead for nine years for pete's sake then I still have to go begging to my daughter's Guardians for what's rightfully mine as far as I'm concerned we're gonna fix that I sure hope so oh I'm working on it meanwhile Gloria I want you to stay off boats you never in my whole life I understand the kind of room with this Gloria Vanderbilt is it's not the child she wants it's the child's money ha ha ha sure sure if little Gloria died her mother cry crocodile tears her millions would be hers it's just what she wants what the mother don't have enough cabbage of her own without the child she has a pauper is what she is with a child I never heard of a poor vanderbolten it's a long story of a man little Gloria is a terrifically wealthy little girl you know what wealth brings greed that's what it brings Oh even from an innocent child a baby lamb would make no difference to them for Gloria Vanderbilt and those sisters of hers that's who don't you worry about them this is what day mrs. Morton will take care of them all right are you after worried about is the kidnappers do I have to go on to you I'm afraid you do Don your mother wants to see you I don't want to see her I'm afraid there's nothing to be afraid about you'll want to be gone a few days you'll be back by the end of the week well I'll go if I have to but I don't want to I'm not happy with my mother sometimes Gloria we have to place duty before our own personal happiness you'll stay with me all the time won't you don't know Oh every instant my sweet life never fear of that journey hippies you're here Oh Oh you you rang that yes Beasley nurse Keys like wants to take miss Gloria to Central Park and then perhaps to a museum and I want you to drive them and stay close by at all times I sent that awful bodyguard away I'm sure you're quite capable of standing whatever God is necessary over my daughter yes ma'am I'll see to it good morning darling don't give mommy a great big good morning kiss mmm the day's first kiss is always best what are you doing I'm paying all these nasty bills writing our checks how do you do it oh well see you subtract the amount of the check from this number here and then you write in the balance after that's been deducted here hmm I don't like arithmetic neither do i darling but you'll find it in life arithmetic is very important has such an exhausting name ages Connie we looked at simply dozens of houses but you're gonna adore the one I picked it's simply smashing and very near glorious school so okay go tune all her lawyers and doctors and violins insist the country living is so healthy for my daughter swell she could have it but I will provide it here's the country living well there you are wait till you hear the wonderful news I have for you the same reason old innocent children are kidnapped darling for your money if I don't give it never give it to her she'll never get your money will we'll find a way to stop we will dear we've come see you pray say our prayer now Shh little flower at this hour say it dark insane little flower at this hour show us thy house so as they say it again so you dig it little flower actus out show us thy power I have to go to the bathroom Fred oh yeah be quick I've taken possession of the Long Island House immediately nurse will be moving out the day after tomorrow she was promised to go back to mrs. with me on Saturday she won't be returning to mrs. Whitney nurse I'd like you to accompany us and stay for a while until we get settled down but Gloria is old enough now for us to dispense with the services of a nurse I believe I won't be with Tilbury anymore the governess Gloria is 10 years old now after all every day and night of her whole life I've been with her since she was three weeks old yes I appreciate that nurse but all good things must come to an end mustn't yes Oh on your way where are you off to today to the park as usual and then we're going to the hospital and visit mrs.

Van de Velde fully intends taking gloria out to a house that she's rented on Long Island I don't really know how to proceed that's why I'm asked you both to come here I need your legal advice I'm only too glad to be of whatever assistance I can be mrs. Whitley but as the child's guardian I must of course take care against appearing in any way partisan in your dispute with mrs. Van der Bilt oh I quite appreciate your position mr. Gilcrest still I did think it was important that you be here today mr. Darlington I want you to tell me what I should do under the circumstances I don't want to do anything that is not absolutely in accord with surrogate Foley's judgment I want you to tell me what I ought to do see what I mean mr. Dunning child's absolutely terrified by a mother I wonder why you know mrs. Whitley I had no idea I see there's no one ask her about the reasons for her her feelings mr. Darlington the child can hardly be expected to be capable of explaining its feelings after all it is only a child what are you doing Charles I'm trying to find miss Gloria's wristwatch Madame they've sent for it her wristwatch who sent for it mrs. Whitney the chauffeurs count for it Beasley he's downstairs this is Whitney what's all this crying and upset being about anyway because my mother wants to take me well that's nothing to cry for I hate my mother what a thing to say you don't hate your mother Gloria you were just excited nobody hates their mother where's Miss Whitney as I told you on the telephone the child was brought to me in a completely hysterical condition there was nothing else to be done in the circumstances you had no right to do anything without calling me first I'm her mother whether you like it or not you've gone too far this time Gertrude where is she Lauria what's the matter with you she's not good for the child you I'll never know for what you've done no wonder the child is in its condition oh yeah Hobbs isn't fit for pigs and you you're a bird oh I could say what I'm going to say yes you see that I have to hire that woman oh of course you must she prevented you from carrying out your intention at least she won't be around anymore to help you carry out yours Gertrude we'll see you've all twisted Glory's mind against me that's what you've done well I don't care how much money and influence you've got so I'm gonna be enough to kidnap a child from its mother but we had to leave our Gertrude's because dr. Craig said she was too upset to be taken away I but Connie said it was probably the best thing to do Connie well I just went along but I want you to get me my child back Nathan they're doing terrible things to my baby well the only way now is of habeus I said which Lawton will discuss glory I prefer not to take that action Tortoises Whitney's attorney now he's gonna be out of town until Monday oh no no I won't wait another minute I want it back now god knows what they'll do to her by Monday okay all right I'll get the writ today but I think you should know just how serious a situation this could get to be I think you should prepare yourself for a very severe reaction understand we have just one other thing I found out just a couple of hours ago you're being followed I beg your pardon you are under constant surveillance by private detectives or in the employ of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney I'm being followed how do you know that I have my sources the point is Laurie that they'll stop at nothing to get the goods on you what goods you took the words right out of my mouth no miss Laurie if this thing goes to court you're gonna be asked a lot of what could be called sensitive questions and I have to ask you the first one what I keep this in mind Gloria I'm your lawyer I'm not your judge I have no opinion about your private life past or present unless there is something in it it could be detrimental to our case unless there was something in that if it came up in court and I did not know about it in bands it could be very embarrassing you tell me there's nothing absolutely nothing except the ravings of my crazy vindictive mother okay excellent private detectives finally it was gonna be like this mrs. Whitney has asked me to say that she wishes at the document be accepted that instead by our attorney mr. Frank Crocker of the firm of solid well you tell mrs. Whitney that she is required by law to accept this writ in person herself and if she doesn't you can tell her for me I'll be just as happy to plaster the whole front of this house with Ritz if you'll just wait a moment mrs. Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney yes you understand Gertrude that if we go into court the publicity will be I quite understand Frank much as I despise airing private matters in public this insulting effrontery of glorious cannot go unchallenged but she would dare to say no me know how she dare go into court where she knows what we know about her of course we must make every effort Frank not to divulge anything of a scandalous nature about Gloria I will not be parted well don't you worry about that Gertrude I'll see to that all right well Gloria had better watch your step now all the dirty linen is about to be laundered in front of the entire nation heavens to Betsy what a sexy I hope you're doing the right thing hon what do you mean well I mean can't always be sure we're getting into can we when we're getting into it Oh Connie stop sounding like my older and wiser sister why I am your older and wiser sister think of a bellman burger if you think you have a good chance of torque mr. Burton any comments you have any chance to get a job you're just a windproof yeah there's no surprise she's got herself some of the best lawyers in the country logic so for this row second you'll all rise oyez oyez oyez the Honorable Supreme Court of the state of New York City and County of New York is now in session the Honorable John Francis Carew presiding machine gentlemen in regard to allegations of unfitness contained and certain affidavits submitted in this case may remind you that there is nothing in the law to warrant the exercise of the powers of parens patriae that would deprive a mother of a child the custody of a child unless the mother was so unfit that constant association of the child with the mother would prevent her from growing up to be a good and useful member of society only the most unusual circumstances would warrant the refusal of the custody of a child in favor of any other relatives no matter how unselfish the motives of that relative may be and only the most compelling evidence of such unusual circumstances would warrant the awarding of the custody of a child to any other person other than the natural mother that's it you may proceed yet oh we call Emma Sullivan Keithley you swear until I say though she's right nothing it looks a little sable sure is what is your occupation nurse when did you take charge of the infants the subject of inquiry in this case I took her when she was three weeks old father was alive did he see the child much all the time what about mrs. Mandeville I seen very little her do you remember some of the people who were in that Paris house friends of mrs. Vanderbilt there was Prince ho and LOI he was a prince but he had no money he was her lover he was a German I moved to strike that out like that oh and there was her brother mr. Morgan that was his support there he was supported by the child I moved to strike that out I get out but mr. Harry Morgan live he lived there he didn't work Your Honor I moved to strike out Prince didn't work either nobody worked it was all supported by the child by the child's money Your Honor please woman stop not good for a witness to volunteer too much it shows a partisan spirit it discounts a testimony severely now remember we have teeth in the front of our mouths like that so we can clamp down on our tongues proceed let me ask you this and so that we can get it straight in the beginning what is your feeling toward the child I object to that what her feelings are jjan sustained may I not show that the person who has charge of the child laughs there I don't know that it's of the slightest importance in this case whether she loves it or not I don't know whether it's important whether she loves it can you tell us something about the books you saw around did you notice what kind of books there were yes they were I saw them I saw the books I never seen anything like it vile books disgusting pictures Your Honor I move to strike that out disgusting your honors a pictures of naked yes Sara Melissa hooks is lying around open he he dropped him down there prince illinois he'd leave them there after you've been reading it to her now risk is leaked to your knowledge did mrs. Vanderbilt ever take the child to Sunday School never never never said a prayer with the child child said her prayers with me I taught her my prayers I believe that you are a Catholic are you yes I am but to your knowledge did mrs. Vanderbilt ever go to Mass never to my knowledge never in my time do you want this child to be reconciled with its mother what do you mean to love its mother yes anyone who would love her yes and and and love all and of God first and be honest and good living and clean and lead a clean life I want her to have a clean life I pray to God to give it to and not ever name dragged in and known like many others didn't mrs. Whitney know before you came to this courtroom that you were going to endeavour to destroy every vestige of the good reputation and character that mrs. Vanderbilt had no she has no good name no her sisters either nobody's safe with this woman yes she's like this letter has already been marked for identification do you recognize the handwriting yes miss letter was supposedly written by little Gloria to her mother and April above here take it won't bite you just don't touch me I have no desire to touch I can assure you yeah I suggest that that letter never originated as we've been asked to believe in the minds of an innocent nine-year-old girl I suggest that those words were dictated to her by another person an adult prayer no objection no we're not all liars we're not your sword we're not your kind call him October 2nd 1934 head Vanderbilt boudoir secret spared servant in Sables peeped on prints paragraph yesterday at the behest of mrs. Harry Payne Whitney a servant in Sables crept up society's back stairs to the witness stand to tell a shocking tale painting her former employer is a lazy loose erotic woman addicted to books and pictures treating of sadism and other forms of abnormal sexual behavior for five hours mrs. Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt listened to a tight lip nurse denounced her with virtuous relish as a cocktail craze dancing mother a devotee of sex erotics and the mistress of a German Prince oh my glorious Gloria it was a blistering tale no skin lotion consumed good morning ladies and gentlemen won't you be seated my only thought since little Gloria came to live with me and throw out the court proceedings has been for the child's welfare she's always saying she's only interested in my daughter's wealth is it middle Gloria's welfare that she's being brought up with hatred for the one person she should love most in the whole world her own mother it was always my hope and desire to bring the child and her mother closer together this case is not of my making she's been behind this whole movement to rob me of my child if this case wasn't her doing as she claims then why were her attorneys trying to find witnesses to testify against me as long ago as last June my most fervent wish is that this case could be put out of the public mind for the sake of the child as for my supposedly being unfit because I was away from my child too much what about Gertrude and her children they grew up with nannies and nurses not their mother and everybody knows that if that's the reason I'm supposed to be unfit then she's no more fit than aya it seems to me that the issue has become sadly enough more one of a mother's personal behavior shall we say but of course I have very little money and Gertrude Whitney has many many millions and eighty million dollars couldn't possibly be wrong could it money has never been a primary issue in this regrettable case we call the rear tire and when were you employed by mrs. Vanderbilt for the first time the scale for the first time in 1929 in Paris and in what capacity were you employed as personal maid will you tell us something about what you remember as to the daily habits of mrs. van der Bilt but when did she get up oh mrs. Van der Bilt got up at the horn one o'clock sometimes two sometimes three sometimes four and sometimes she said it meant all day did you notice anything about the kind of books there were around the house yes well they're books with pictures in them yes what kind of books were there there were very dirty books what kind of pictures whether you say there were dirty books oh he had pictures said we're not allowed to look at that what you mean sure but I'm trying to find out now whether they were pictures of one sex or both sexes or what what difference would it make what sex they were supposing they were homosexual your honor wouldn't make any difference where they were homosexual or bisexual unisexual trisection all right maybe just as dirty if they were homosexual or unisexual or bisexual or trisexual er yeah I will with for the best suit were you with mrs. Van der Bilt when she went down to the Riviera in 1932 and can yes when did she live at the Miramar she lived there for how many weeks or months two months did she live alone no no I think she was living with her friend lady mid-field Evan and this friend lady Milford Haven appeared to be a decent fine lovely person yes and this is van de Ville was with her at the hotel yes did you see any impropriety of that hotel during the two months at the Marimo Hotel do not understand during those two months that mrs. Vanderbilt get drunk no I did not see you at all did she run around with anyone yes ooh landlady midfield Evan no you said there were there some men or gentlemen no I always sir mrs. Van der beek coming coming out of the Miramar Hotel with her friend letting me feel David so you did not see any improper conduct during the entire two months isn't that right I remember something that seems to me very funny tell us if you can what thing you saw well one day mrs. Vanderbilt got me for breakfast like she do she always called me for breakfast she called you for breakfast yes so I serve breakfast and I took her things up to my home for placing them and a few minutes afterwards I came back into mrs.

Van Der Beek's neck lady Milford Evans arm was along mrs. Venable neck and she was kissing her like a lover intercession to this file give your testimony of this style we were taken privately hey what is excused except the parties in this case Berninger why why did I ask that last question why that is first-year law school you'll never ask a question unless you have the answer to it and Gloria why didn't you tell me that she was your special friend I told you about our friendship Oh sweetheart please please now there are friendships and then there are friendships it's all so ugly folks it's a pack of malicious lies Gloria now please if you're anything more to tell me but Pete sake just tell me now please no there's nothing nothing not what about the books you did not tell me about the books what about those books who cares about the books what I do in the privacy of my own home is nobody's business no huh it used to be nobody's business I've studied the situation over the weekend I've come to the conclusion that's so much scandalous gossip being bet loose from this courtroom that it might embarrass the child's future therefore I have determined to hold the future sessions of this trial and private Noah will be allowed in this room during the taking of testimony except those people about safe for by counsel in order to accommodate the members of the press I am prepared to provide them with my personal summaries of the testimony I will meet with the reporters from the evening papers at 1:00 p.m. and the reporters from the morning papers at 4:00 p.m. it's all asleep well barring the press in the public yes the civil Practices Act covers it but the personal summary of the testimony I know it sounds kind of fishy me and why was it you and not your daughter who engaged the nurse for the infant mrs. Morgan my daughter didn't show any desires or any interest to choose the nurse and the mother what contribution did she make toward the care of the child it is not my daughter's fault but she has not been born with a maternal instinct no she was indifferent to the child she had nothing to do with the child mrs Morgan will you search back in your memory and tell us when you commenced to say is into your daughter by way of protest about the life that your daughter was living or about the care of the child what did you complain to your daughter about her conduct well during the last six years I've been all the I'm telling her that she must settle down and love her own country better than she did to live in this country and to take an interest in the things of our country and to drop the European entanglements and the European titles and the desires of for a life of pleasure that you can get on the other side and to be more domestic and to do things like that I love my daughter it's for my baby's sake that I'm doing this your honor this is sacrifice of my life that I am making I am going to remain alone in this world without anybody if she had committed murder I would have taken her on my own shoulders for her except for the baby not if she had murdered the baby mommy mommy but I did not know that I would be called to go through this gallery on earth that I am going through how did it come do this Court is adjourned until 10:00 a.m. Monday morning nice weekend Gloria guess who's coming to see you this morning I'm afraid she's a bit upset where is she in her room is Keith Luke with her no I sent her away for the day good my grandson's nurse is with her miss Walsh perhaps it would be better not to see her just now Gloria we're here to see the child and seer we will Laurie darling it's mommy nice no she must open this door we're here to see this little girl this is a court order I know it is but Gloria won't give me the key why did you let her have it didn't she took it we'll take it back for goodness sakes hurry we must stop this immediately give me that kid do you hear me get here hang it over Gloria Gloria this is aunt Thelma open the door this instant she's thrown the key in the fire she what Laurie thank you George what's the matter you're not frightened about Thelma are you yes oh yeah I haven't done anything to you no well then come on give me a kiss don't talk like a little child you know your mother's in there crying you've made her very unhappy what'd you go and tell her you sorry and give her a kiss no look here Gloria do you realize how much you're hurting your mummy you don't really want to hurt her do you what do you know all right then I won't tell are you sorry for behaving like such a silly little girl growing up no you can't behave this way Gloria that's what you see I am keep asking for you in the car we could play it together okay Oh hello oh yes put her on hello Julia how high Annie well you call me with bad news Julie I don't want any bad news yes I'm sitting down what sure Julie they can't do that that's against the law but well who leaked it Oh Julia really honest to god it you don't know did it okay all right thanks again honey goodbye that was Julia McCarthy from the news somebody leaked the booklets testimony it's gonna be in the midnight edition that's contempt of court Nate oh just when I need a lawyer concerning a missive Annabelle's taste in literature Zog admitted that he looked at a book of erotic drawings of unclothed nuns as many as he could stand these which showed women in unconventional positions the butler testified reluctantly as someone who is in this courtroom while the butler was on the witness stand gave a very accurate story of his testimony to the newspapers somebody has betrayed my confidence now if we were not for the fact that I don't want to embarrass this trial at this moment I most certainly would ascertain the culprit if there is anything we can do in the way of an investigation I will be glad to cooperate your honor your honor I have already spoken to the managing editor of The Daily News mr. Frank House and strenuously requested that both sides of the story be written now may I request that your previous ruling as to secrecy be a rolling stance these proceedings will continue close to the press and to the public and when I went into the room the child appeared preoccupied and discouraged emotionally I asked her what had happened she said that her mother had wanted to keep her and she the child didn't want to stay I asked her why she didn't want to stay and what did she reply to that dr. Lawrence she said because I hate my mother I asked her why on earth she should feel that way towards her mother she said because I'm afraid of her did you say anything to her at that time doctor I told her don't take life so seriously and you say that after only six days of treatment by you the condition of the child improved most certainly dreams are better you say the terrors are gone James better Tara's gone and all this in six days is that true doctor I produced a marvelous change beautiful result a happy child I think it's wonderful here in the greatest metropolis of the world the city of the purple robe and copper-clad we find this bitterest of family vendetta's and for what the custody of a little golden girl who is too young to understand with all the mudslinging means mrs. Vanderbilt and her brothers and sisters are fighting mad family skeletons will rattle when the new celebrated legal battle resumes operation this morning in the Supreme Court in such a tale were staged in a Broadway theatre a pictured on the screen the audience would shout impossible the place at Westbury has been in my husband's family for a great many years my children were brought up there and after they married I built them houses on the place near so that we all live in a small community and my children and my grandchildren are there it's a little community of children except one children too many don't get back it oh I'll get it go on Thawne get back that go and get back get back come on come on come on Go Go Harry get back come on get back get back you hear me get that hell up this is your deadline there anybody who comes any closer to my courtroom than that will be held in contempt of court and contempt now where were we you're told his honor that you maintain studios in New York and an Old Westbury Long Island yes you have models yes now in your work you design in the nude don't you I presume you mean my models are in the new not I that's what I mean yes both male and female yes totally nude yes breasts of women exposed yes certainly now has the childhood Gloria Vanderbilt been to your museum the Whitney Museum yes once or twice where the pictures are exposed and the statuary is exposed yes and some of it is yours yes this point your honor I will offer an evidence a partial list of certain articles apart though you at the Whitney Museum of American life a mural painting of a woman wearing a very short black slip and no panties and black silk stockings and black shoes the lack of panties and the short slip leave the thighs and the under paws exposed entirely a man's torso showing that genitalia exposed in a very pronounced manner a nude figure of a woman leaning on her hands in a sitting position with the breasts Hani developed legs slightly raised apart sketch of a woman who has gone to the roof to hang wet wash being embraced in a corner by a much younger man while a small child sits at one side playing with clothes pins and clothes basket giving the impression of a married woman cheating in front of a child entitled love on the roof you say to his honor that this paper describes accurately the paintings and figures in a crude manner yes incidentally John Sloan's love on the roof is of itching not a sketch I stand corrected my artistic education has been badly neglected no doubt I shouldn't be surprised I offer this in evidence I object to it as a material course the situation is very different from having a lot of dirty pictures around the house and those figures were absolutely naked were they not when you sculpted them I used women models when they were absolutely nude how about the man not completely in the nude what do you mean not completely a fig leaf or something analogous to a fig leaf but in the case of the women the women were absolutely stark naked yes now are there any figures there those that you sculpted yourself that are without the presence of the fig leaf yes when you're completed the designing you tore off the fig leaf is that it on the statue I did on the model I did not I should like to say that the paintings and sculptures in the Whitney Museum mentioned earlier and many others like them are works of art and are recognized as such they are no different than similar works of art in the Louvre or the Metropolitan Museum the Whitney Museum is a recognized Museum of Art it's open to the public free no complaint has ever been made about any work of art contained in it I always hope that little Gloria and her mother could have a closer relationship I said everything I could to arouse in this child an affection for her mother in accordance with that idea that they should have a closer relationship it wasn't the child's only apprehension was that her mother was going to take her out to Long Island to live with her certainly not when the child showed hysterics and started to shriek and scream when her mother came into the room that was not just because she didn't want to go out and live with her in the country when the child said if I have to go back I'd rather die that is not simply a fear of going back if you through no I'm not if the child says I'm afraid of my mother I don't want to go back with her I don't want to be with her that signifies something far beyond the fact that she doesn't want to go on it in the country the fact is the child was afraid for her life did she have to testify they're insisting on a Gloria it's perfectly cruel I don't know how I even got you can do this to her when we've got one break at least she won't have to appear in the courtroom Carew will take a testimony in his chambers and only Smythe and I will be there I don't know how they can do this - huh just have the face of Gloria I hate to say this but she's their star witness don't you think you could learn to love your mother no I never want to go back to her do I have to think you'd want to know she was never nice to me how was she not nice to you middle her huh once I had a little dog very much and she took him away from me maybe the dog had fleas no he didn't but didn't you like your mother before you went out to live in the country no I didn't let you send her all these nice little postal cards here all these nice little pictures of animals and and flowers and all these X's and O's well I had to because I was afraid of her afraid of what I don't know I'm just afraid of her you know any prayers yes let's hear you say some prayers hel Mary full of grace Lord is with thee blessed art thou look well talked a little slower I can't say it unless I say it fast hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with thee blessed art thou blessed art thou I see that every night it's awfully funny I can't remember it do you say the our Father our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us it is not into temptation but deliver us from evil amen and I know this one this is a short one when you want something to happen you say little flower at this hour show me thy power dodo tell me that can you say the Apostles Creed I used to know that but I forget can I go now how about the act of contrition you know when you say you're sorry for your sins no this child's religious education has obviously been badly neglected now in this photograph your mother you're smiling I'm smiling with you mother right yes because of photographer said to smile and at that time you hated your mother yes Gary how old were you when you began to hate your mummy as soon as I could understand things as soon as totally Nene explained things to me Gloria wondered understood that she doesn't dislike her mother it's just that she hasn't seen very much up does she claim that her mother neglected her she doesn't seem to recall anything about that we just say to look glorious unusually bright child oh no nothing about children what do you have five of your own they their mother's concern yes we all had the strictest of Catholic education when the child went to bed she used to cross herself and say Hail Mary in French I was talking to her yesterday and she made no suggestion that she knew anything whatever about making a sign of the Cross I watched her I gave her every opportunity now if there is one thing that is characteristic of the Catholic above all others it is the making of the sign of the Cross now you go over the waterfront and you see a fella about to jump in the water he'll make a sign on the cross before he jumps in if he's a Catholic I've seen Jewish boys make the sign of the Cross when I jumped in there was a gang of us in the neighborhood and we used to go swimming every day after school weather permitting the East River that was I don't know whether little boys still go swimming in there after school but if they do in there Catholics you can bet your bottom dollar they make the sign across at least I hope they do be a sad state of affairs of things have come to such a pass that religion no longer plays a part in the daily play of little boys sad state of affairs I remember one little fella Oh must have been in line at the time I suppose a little bit of chat in a resolution introduced before the committee of courts and practices at the Federal Bar Association lawyers today denounced Supreme Court Justice John F Cairo for borrowing the public and press not to mention line to the reporters about what's really going on in court grievous damage already inflicted on the plaintiff who is asserting the most natural of Rights with every sympathy and presumption in her favor the court saw fit to clamp the lid of secrecy on all further evidence the plaintiff protested her counsel protested and yet the court has seen fit to brush aside these fundamental considerations of justice the judges course in this matter is wrong he is obviously made a mistake and a grievous one this judge is incomprehensible wonderful Nathan says Cara's gone around the bend no you're not looking too good hon lost a lot of weight since this trial began eleven pounds in five weeks well beats dialing mrs. Vanderbilt will you tell us briefly where you spent your early life up to the time that you married mr. Vanderbilt I was born in Lucerne Switzerland in 1905 I stayed in Europe until 1916 in 1916 my sister Thelma and I came to America for six months in 1917 I spent nine months in America and the rest in Europe in 1918 I spent nine months in the United States and went back to Europe in 1920 I went to Brussels where my father and mother were then living in 1921 I visited in America until thelma's marriage June 19-22 I went to Brussels in September 1922 I came back to America in March 1923 I married mr. Vanderbilt I was 18 please tell us where you were educated and the name of the school or schools there were so many uh I was in school in Switzerland I was in school in Spain I was in school in Germany I was in school in Switzerland again and then I went again to France within a period of four years you attended school in four different countries conducted in four different languages yes I think so I guess who it's very complicated I never in my life touched my daughter in anger except for once one time when she asked me for some money in those days she was a very little bit of a thing she used to open my bag and look through it there was some loose change I said Gloria you can't have that because it hasn't been washed the money I said I'll give it back to you after it's been washed she said oh well I'll go and ask nanny so off she went to ask her grandmother so when I went after her and I said Gloria mommy says you can't have any money that hasn't been washed and I took her by the shoulders and I turned her around this way I didn't push her and I didn't know treat her I I just turned him around and said off with you to nurse so she started crying because she couldn't have the money before I was washed then when I came in mrs. Vanderbilt was in bed reading a paper and there was lady milford-haven beside the bed with her arm around mrs van der Bilt's neck lady Milford's arm around mrs van der Bilt's neck and she was kissing her like a left mrs. Vanderbilt it any such occurrence ever take place it certainly did not were you ever guilty of such an act or similar act with any woman any time at any place no never when his honor undertook the difficult task of talking to your daughter she said that she hardly saw anything of you and that you weren't nice to her said an accurate statement that is not an accurate no although she written lots of letters she said she didn't love you but only wrote them because she was afraid of you now did you ever see or notice any fear on the child's part never never had any doctor would seen her during all the years that you had her did any doctor tell you that upon examination he discovered that the child had an apprehension or fear of you know 10 a.m. tomorrow morning Oh and it's perfectly obvious to anyone with half an eye that mrs. Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt attended constantly by a nurse in position is on the brink of a complete nervous breakdown she has been questioned and crossed questioned about little thoughtless actions throughout her widowhood she's been vilified with the testimony of discharged servants and now at the end smiling bravely she faces the final issue will her child be restored her in the meantime the little girl who was the bone of contention remains with her aunt and her palatial Westberry estate a member of the household stated the child had not seemed aware of the recent proceedings or if she was she did not appear interested while her fate is being decided by others a little girl plays with her toys and puppies her cheeks glowing with autumn wind her eyes dancing doctor sir Lawrence told you to let the child stay in America during the whole summer of 1932 while you went to England or Paris are you trying to make my child out as critically ill she was not but she wasn't quite well enough to travel right after the operation in anyway I was sailing back as soon as I got my house closed in Paris oh then you came back then I came back I went back again in June I was there July and part of August in France and now you're going back to 1932 that's what you asked me don't get me mixed up it's bad enough to keep my own mind straight without keeping yours you are not responsible for my mines mrs. Vanderbilt thank God for that yes thank God for that I am trying to find out how responsible you were for your child you're not trying to make me how crazy by any chance are you and not exactly no I'm glad to hear it dear Naini I received your letter and your cable I am writing this letter in bed to you as I have a bad throat I hope that you will excuse my letter dear Naini Tony's mother is putting me into another room every week who's there his mother Oh mrs. Vanderwaal sister your honor lady Finans my mother is so bad to me I wish that I could run away to New York to you I am very unlucky girl love from Gloria this is the handwriting of your child is it not it may be the handwriting of my child but it was never written by a child of that age I am a dirty Li her hand was held or the letters were dictated to her by someone I am NOT going to acknowledge that my child wrote that letter willingly the question is I don't care what the question is that's my answer does it occur to you that the letters complaining about you were written by a child who might be afraid of you her letters to me didn't show that well as she said in her own testimony the affectionate letters to you were written because she had to write them if she was forced to write letters of affection to me then she might have been forced to write letters against me can you imagine any motive your mother can have except the welfare of the child to say anything against you yes I gather I'm sorry to say money why should money come into any motive on the part of your mother you better ask mrs. Whitney that that's where my mother's getting her money from now are you charging that mrs. Whitney has been giving money to your mother yes but can you imagine any motive your mother can have had prior to the time that mrs. Whitney came into this matter in 1932 it's very hard for me to say this but I must say it against my mother since you're forcing me to she wants the guardianship of the child so as she can get the money from Gloria's trust fund do you really mean that I certainly do can you tell this court any motive mrs. Whitney can have except the welfare of her brother's child I don't know what this is Whitney's motives are I've never known what mrs. Whitney's motives are mrs. mandible do you believe that's leaving your child for extended periods of time as has been established in this court do you believe that that is taking care of your child I think it's just as much taking care of my child is when mrs. Whitney is never around how does that compare with your absence as time and again with a child lying sick no give me that my job do you remember being told that before this court the child was asked would she go back to her mother and that she shrank back and tears came out of her eyes and she said I will not go I am afraid of my mother yes yes I remember you trying to do break my heart witness is excused oh really that's all your honor that's all your honor we rest erased that we read both sides rest is heavy sharp recess he's coming back here now me the issue here is the best interest of the child I cannot approve of the conduct of the mother and relation to the child nevertheless their mother is a young woman I don't think that the child should altogether be taken from this woman I would be glad if she would have the opportunity in the first place to win back the child's confidence and affection and in the second place to show that her future conduct will not be as a past conduct as bit I think she should have such access to the child as will not interfere with the present life of the child I will give her an opportunity to win the child back and to take care of it properly in the future I intend and some degree now to preserve for some time life that the child has now as I construe your honors words it simply means that she is deprived of the child that's my instruction of it well to some extent she certainly is but even if she were a thousand times more guilty than she ever has been I still have enough of the human in me to want to give her an opportunity for the future we'll have another little talk you and I and mr. Smythe you may transcribe from your notes this statement mr. justice Carew has decided that the child Gloria Vanderbilt will not have for the future the life that it had from the death of its father until June 1932 but what is this even mean your honor every word means exactly what it says nothing boss look what kind of life is that kid to leave well that will have to be worked out the mother needs a guardian almost as much as the child does my mind is still open on the settlement when my final decision is filed it will be a work of supreme genius and will be recognized as such when will the decision be filed judge it will take the usual course governess for biscuit and it is further considered ordered found judge and decreed that he said writ of habeas corpus be finally disposed of as follows mrs. Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney is granted custody of said infant shall provide for her a governess of the Roman Catholic faith who shall reside with her teacher the Catechism of the Roman Catholic faith Nathan she can read at any time I think we've got the gist okay I see her at all beginning next month you have her from 10 o'clock Saturday morning till sundown on Sunday you have a during the mother July you have her gen o'clock so 6 o'clock on Christmas Day at least we got rid of the nurse he's like has a walking papers the judge was agreeable to that I put everything I had into this case do a little Gloria happy at last and so the matter of Vanderbilt is done the drama that has so enthralled the nation for these many months is ended but what really has been accomplished by all this scandalous hue and cry of charge and counter-charge just this the Justice John Francis Carew the socialites Solomon has wielded his sword of dubious justice and his severed perhaps forever what fragile bonds still remain between the Liguria and her mother he has taken the child from her mother and awarded to the woman whom the mother probably most attests in the world can either of these women refrain from trying to influence the child's mind against the other I think not and what will that do to the child Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney may have won the battle but it is surely a Pyrrhic victory and his most tragic casualty is certainly the poor little rich girl herself Gloria Laura Vanderbilt you I think your honor in all fairness that no matter what disposition your honor makes us to these charges the day will come when this issue must be tried out between this child and her mother three years after the trial Justice John Francis Carew was discovered to be a patient at the neuropsychiatric Hospital in Hartford Connecticut an institution specializing in the treatment of alcoholism and nervous breakdowns Nathan Birkin unsuccessfully pursued the case to the United States Supreme Court in 1936 he died of a heart attack never having fully recovered from his failure to vindicate Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt eleven years after the trial little Gloria now 21 years old brought nurse easlick to live with her in New York City providing a permanent annual income in 1942 Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney died at 67 years of age leaving in a state in excess of 80 million dollars her funeral was attended by 1,200 mourners Laura Kilpatrick Morgan died in 1956 at age 79 only her two daughters Gloria and Thelma and one friend attended the funeral in 1964 Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt died at the age of 60 her sister Thelma at her bedside she had never remarried for estrangement from her daughter persisted throughout her life with only occasional periods of strained reconciliation 42 years after the trial when asked what of all her possessions she most valued little Gloria replied the one thing I treasure most is a small round friend of my mother and me when I was an infant you you
