A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Are you happy? Happiness? Hmm. I don't know. Never thought about it. Does it really matter? - Are you still looking for happiness? - Sure, I am. I'm chasing it even if I won't be able to catch it. Trying to be true to myself. You're the one who taught me that, Eda. Then I've forgotten what I knew. Seriously, how was it like that? We thought we could defy the whole world. [Işık] What's going to happen now? I don't know. It's clear. We're screwed. [Necdet] Okay, Ms. Burcu, say what you have to say and we'll proceed to the vote. I have nothing to say. There's a major transgression here. There is no need to even talk about it. - Let's kick them out. Ruin their lives. - Yes. - They deserve it. - You're right. Crime and punishment. It's the rule of society. Uh, it just occurred to me now. As a single woman, I took self-defense lessons last year. I got trained to fight. In case I'd need to. But I was told that punches wouldn't help you sometimes. For instance, when someone points a gun in your face. What's that got to do with anything? You're going off topic. No, sir. It just occurred to me. Let's say someone pulls a gun on you, to your face. Determined to kill you. What would you do? [scoffs] This was the training. Talk about yourself. Who you are, your real story. Maybe you can spark their conscience. What do you mean? Are we killing these kids? We're banning them from formal education, which they deserve. - The worst ones... - We say "the worst ones," don't we? Yes. The worst ones. This description helps us forget they're real people. It enables us to be ruthless when we are fighting against them. - Come on now... - [Burcu] Kerem. Son of Kenan Öz. What a privileged way of coming into the world. And he's out there creating a mess. - Spoiled. - Or angry. Angry about everyone looking at him that way. Sure, Kenan Öz is an important man. But do we know what kind of a father he is? Do we know what Kerem is going through at home? Eda. A very talented girl. Brave enough to do anything. But we want to kick her out. She's beautiful anyway. Nothing would happen to her, right? She could just marry someone and that's it! Ms. Burcu. I'd like to remind you, you were blaming us for making it personal. But that's exactly what you're doing right now. Yes, because we needed to make it personal. I just happened to realize that every person is a distinct world. What matters is not principles and the rules, but the person, even if that person seems horrible from the outside. Sinan's been living alone since he was 14. He was abandoned by his parents. With all that pain, this kid could have burned the school down. But he's only trying to stand on his feet and move on with his life. [muttering] I can't believe it. Do we really know what it means to not experience being someone's child? Not to be loved by one's parents? Do we have any idea how to live with that? Do we know who those kids really are while we're about to execute them? Did we ever think about how Osman could change the world? Okay. Let's shoot them! We don't like them anyway. Let's deny their existence. Is this killing them? In fact, by leaving them with no chance... That's it. It's giving them no chance. Are we all okay with taking on that responsibility? I mean, what if we pick up the newspaper one day to see one of them actually killed themselves? God forbid. Will we still stand by our decision? [exhales] I will. Come on, let's vote! I consent. Let's get them expelled. Ah. Yes. Let's cut to the chase, friends. Please. Yes? Come on! - What's going on? - I'm not sure. [Refik] We're a bit confused. Ms. Burcu has a point, sir. No way. It's just a cheap argument. She read a book or two, and now she's babbling nonsense. I just said what I think. You know best. Ms. Ayşe. Come on! Mr. Refik. Let's give them one last chance. They should apologize. One last time. [Ayşe] I agree. Let's not ruin their lives. They should have a last chance. Let's hear them apologize. [Necdet] My god! What's gotten into you? With a vote of 11 to 1, it's been decided that the kids won't be expelled if they express their regret and apologize. [exhales deeply] Eleven to one. By a majority, it's been decided that you'll apologize. [door closes] [adult Eda] Necdet. What a son of a bitch. He was determined to screw us all. - I swear, that's what I heard. - Really? Everybody's talking about it! [boy 1] Wow! End of a legend, huh? [boy 2] Tell me about it. It's a shame. [indistinct chatter] Eda will get what she deserves. I seriously couldn't believe it. Necdet finally did it. He will finish them off. I'll laugh about it, let me tell you! We screwed them. - [all chuckling] - Good thing nothing happened to us. Nothing would have happened. We have a clean record. Seeing them like this, I'm over the moon with joy. What's going on? Here's the deal. We're going to stand on the podium during the flag ceremony and apologize. - What? In front of everyone? - [Osman] Exactly. - He's trying to hurt our pride. - [Eda] Yeah, right. We're going to go up there, apologize, and feel small. And Necdet's going to show the whole school how big his balls are! But isn't that so irritating? [Kerem] That's the point. He's going to hang the delinquents in front of everyone. It's a question of power. Fear is the greatest authority. He wants to show his power. No fucking way! Don't be ridiculous. We'll just apologize and be done with it. We're saved. It's over. What? Do we have no pride? But you're leaving anyway. You won't get expelled. That's not the case, honey. I canceled the transfer application. Why? It's that... If I'm... If I'm not myself... If I'm just an asshole who runs away, what's the point of all this? I'm telling you we're getting off the hook. Think pragmatically. Let's just apologize. Don't be so proud. Don't we always say, "It's not important what it is, but where you put it"? Don't give it meaning. Let's just get it over with. - It's not like that. - It's exactly like that. I agree. Let's not make it a big deal. We're at fault after all. Right? - Sinan. - The punishment doesn't fit the crime. Are you going to bring justice to the world? If we get expelled, would the punishment fit the crime? It's worse. I won't apologize, I'll tell you that much. - We need to think. - Yeah, we need to think. All right, then. Every man for himself. The ceremony is tomorrow. Think about it if you like. I'll go up and make my apology. I recommend you do the same. Mr. Kemal. You asked for me. I did. Sit. - For your help the other day... - But you haven't listened to me. Again, you created a mess. I did the best I could. You're an amazing person. You blow my mind. Your fight. Your stance... It's incredible. That purity of yours is like a drop of water. Who is this man? Why do you want him? Why him and not me? Tell me. I'll do my best. I'm ready to fight for it in any way. I'm ready to race for it. Tell me, even if I have the slightest chance. Choose me. Be with me. I want to be the one for you. I broke up with him. [laughing] I've been waiting for this for such a long time. Kerem, I'm sorry. If I hurt you. I know that sometimes I can get more aggressive than you can handle. That's because I expect a lot from you. Nothing else. I'm sorry. Thanks. You apologize, too. I mean, tomorrow at school. Look, we'll come, too, and be there with you. - There is no need. - There is. You need support, so I'll come. Don't look at anyone, just look at me. And get it over with, huh? I assure you it's not as big of a deal as you think it is. ["Ode to My Family" playing] [knock on door] [door opens] I ironed this. You can wear it tomorrow. Your dad and I are coming, too. - Why, Mom? Don't... - Eda, come on! Mom, come here for a second. Come, sit. - What do you think about this? - Let me see. It's nice. A little rough, though. I was thinking... Maybe I should be a graphic designer. - Study graphic arts? What do you say? - I don't know... Isn't it a bit beneath you? - What do you mean? - You have a lot of potential. What kind of potential? What kind of potential requires me not to do something I love and am good at? Eda, are you all right? I'm good. Very good, actually. - Anyway, Mom. Thanks. - Okay. ♪ ...where's when I was young And we didn't give a damn ♪ ♪ 'Cause we were raised ♪ [Aynur] We feel safe within the rules, honey. Not fitting in, on the other hand, makes life difficult. Besides, there's nothing wrong with being ordinary, honey. It's comfortable. You walk through life without problems, never stumbling.

So we'll do whatever it takes? Will you do it? I will. You? That would be the smart thing to do. Let's do it. - [Osman] Sinan? - Yeah... Let's do whatever's necessary. ♪ My father, my father, he liked me ♪ ♪ Oh he liked me, does anyone care? ♪ ♪ Does anyone care? ♪ You think that was true? What? The decisions you make at 17, do they really not matter? Or do they determine who you really are? Do your first decisions make you the person you are? What do you think? What's your opinion? Are we the same forever? Looks like it. If you, today, could meet you back then, what would you say? What would you say to your 17-year-old self? So many things. I'd tell her, "Don't be afraid to carry yourself with dignity, to be yourself. When do you listen to adults? When you don't have anything to say yourself. Always have hope. Nothing is the end of the world. Life is longer than you think it is. New roads will open for you. When you think you've hit a wall, new doors will open." I would tell her that life's going to start over and over. "Know yourself, realize and determine your own worth. Don't care too much about how people view you. Only you can know who you really are. You're the only you. You're worthy of love. Understand that." But, of course, our 17 year-old self would also have a lot to say to us. There are so many things we got hold of and lost amid the tiredness of adult life. Things lost along the way. You kept it! Come off it. Come off. We were asked to apologize. You remember? [sighs] [chuckles] Ayşe! I love you. [crowd cheering] Hülya! Hülya, I love you! Fuck off. [indistinct chatter] Wow. So they agreed to apologize. Necdet made sure they're not so cocky anymore. Look at them. Can't believe we're seeing this. [laughs] What happened? You've turned into babies all of a sudden. Bringing your parents with you as well. Nice! Write it down. "Dear teachers. Dear friends. Today, I'm here to apologize to all of you. I regret my mistakes. I insisted on acting without care for anyone else. I tried to get attention with my spoiled behavior. I thought I was smarter than you all. I destroyed everything with my great arrogance. I was the one in the wrong all along. I should have fit in, behaved. I should have listened to Mr. Necdet. There was no point in disturbing everyone. I was too stupid to realize that. I'm very sorry. I can't tell you how much I regret it." - Did you write it all? - Yes, sir. Good job. Let them read one by one. What's up? Don't do anything stupid. Come on, move. Don't make it a big deal. It's a shit world. Things happen. Are you and Burcu a thing now? [scoffs] None of your business. - She broke up with the fiancé? - Mmm. She did. How nice. We did it. Hmm? We wanted Burcu to stay so she can keep saving our ass and we can graduate. So we picked you. We thought love would save us. How can you have anything to do with it? Whatever happened, happened. Right. But with the May 19th ceremony, the rock concert and all, we pushed it in that direction a little. Whatever. I just thought you should know. [microphone feedback] [Necdet] Sound check. Miss. Will you tell Burcu? [Necdet] Check. What's going on here? So... what's up? I'm late to the flag ceremony. You're not coming? I'm not talking about that. I meant Kemal. You came and went that night. Then I found myself out the door. [clears throat] Look, if you're hooking up with him, at least tell me honestly. I should have understood. The universe keeps bringing you together somehow. Someone has your back. The universe? I was thinking, could you come, too? Just for protection. They won't do anything if you're there. Look how you separated them right away. - [Kemal] Get out, I'll deal with it. - No, I'll do it. - Okay, leave it to me. - No. It's just right here. [knock on door] Can you please open the door? We want Ms. Burcu and Coach Kemal to lead the rehearsals this year. You need to love yourself first. You need to be able to accept yourself. Otherwise, what you call love is a couple of enjoyable moments, some fake desperation. [Eda] The illusion of all these things that you know wrong. Thinking you love them, because they love you. By the way, Coach Kemal's jacket. We had it. You know him. You can give it to him. [Necdet] Sound control. Check. One, two... Sound check! Sound check, check. Boy! Order! [indistinct chatter] Due to the damage they've done to our school, we've been put through a lot of trouble. Us, as educators. You, as students. The destruction of our brand new lab was the last straw. Thankfully, they decided to mend their ways and want to apologize to us all. We took the high ground and accepted it. Since the whole school deserves this apology, they're going to apologize to all of us. Yes. Sinan, come up here. Go ahead, read your confession. Let's get your apology. You regret it, right, son? You won't do it again? Go on, apologize to your friends. Read it. No, I don't regret it. I would do it again. [crowd murmuring] [indistinct chatter] I should have known nothing would become of you. Go. You're done, boy. Yes, Eda. Let's get you over here. I'm sure you don't agree with your friend. No, I don't. Actually, you know what I'm thinking? You need to take a new direction with your style, sir. [crowd exclaiming] These moccasins... Plus, please get rid of that disgusting suit in the color of your nickname. [crowd chuckling] Besides, I'm not apologizing. This is a disgusting ego trip. [indistinct chatter] [both laughing] - You were so crazy. - Like you weren't! Okay, we were all crazy. You think they will come? [Necdet] Kerem, come up here. Look, your esteemed dad is here, too. He already reached out to us. He agreed to rebuild the lab. You being here is a mere formality so that it wouldn't be unfair. Come on, son! Come on. Okay. You regret it, right? You wouldn't want to do something like this, we know that. Go on, tell your friends... Read what's in your hand. [Kerem clears throat] Good morning. I'm Kerem Öz. Kerem. Not Kenan. To make sure there's no confusion. I'll put this paper aside and use my own words. Do I regret what I did? Would I do it again? Yes, I would. This is who I am. [indistinct chatter] Long story short, I'm not apologizing. And your lab can go to hell. [crowd exclaiming] [indistinct chatter] [Necdet] Quiet! [indistinct chatter continues] [Necdet] Calm down! Quiet! I said quiet! Işık. Come here. Anyway! What happened, happened. Everyone made their own decision. We're just trying to be fair, here. Işık, come on! Show your friends. Be an example to all students. Come on! We have to make Ms. Burcu fall in love. Fine, I'll help you. How nice. We will spread love, right? "My mom says so, then it must be true." How stupid is that? Hold on tight, okay? Don't give up. Even if you think you'll be sad, go for it. At least you'll have lived through it. What you can't experience is worse. I'm thinking of you. It makes me feel better. I only have one wish. Let's still be in each other's lives in 20 years. No, I don't regret it. Everything I did was my choice. This is who I am, and I'm not ashamed of it. Maybe it's you who's wrong. When cars drive towards us, why should we assume we're in the wrong lane? Besides, your need for us to apologize, where will it lead you exactly, sir? How correct are you? Did you know they were beating up my friend Kerem? Of course I was going to try to save him. I'm not apologizing. If I ran away as my friend took a beating, I would have apologized, but to myself. I would have never forgiven myself. Now, I'll say it again. I don't regret it at all. I would do it again. And I'm proud of myself for doing it. [crowd cheering and whistling] - Silence! - [cheering continues] What's going on? What? What good does that do? Calm down! Stop it. Osman! Come up here, son. Your friends hurt themselves with ridiculous ideas. But there's a serious crime here. There's no harm in expressing regret. Your future is in question after all. It's your future at stake here. Let's hear your apology, at least. Yes. The mic is yours. Sure. [boy] What is he doing? [indistinct chatter] [microphone feedback] Come on, son. Fuck you all. I'm not apologizing. [crowd cheering and whistling] ["I Gotta Rise Up" playing] Damn you! Cut it off. Son! Cut it off. Cut it off. Shame on you. Impudents! [Necdet] Be quiet.
