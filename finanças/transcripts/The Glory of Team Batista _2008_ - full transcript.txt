Presented by TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting System, Inc.) TOHO CO., LTD. We're ready for you, Doctor. Good luck. Just as I imagined. OK, go. Stopping the heart. Applying clamp. Flow down. Flow down. Clamp in place. Backup. Backup complete. Infuse cardioplegia. Yes, Doctor. The Glorious Team Batista Releasing aortic clamp. Backup. Back on ventilator. Backup complete. Heart's not restarting. Pacing. - Other way. -Sorry! Rate of 30. V fib! DC! Dr.Haba, I idocaine! 100 mg. Hurry it up! What's his temperature? 96.8. Normal. Prepare DC 50 Joules! Charged. Doctor... Doctor! I'm filing a malpractice suit. This was a clear botch up. And all of you conspired to cover it up. All I wanted was to have a boil removed. But instead you took away my signature trait. Let me repeat. This mole here, and the one on my forehead... without both of them, I'm not me! I won't let this slide. That's all for today. Shall I pencil you in for next Monday, then? Next Monday? That's an unlucky day on the Buddhist calendar. The 25th is lucky. The 25th, then? Professor Udo is here to see you. How can I help you? I'm in a bind. Over what? A last-minute request from the Director. But your silver anniversary round the-world trip is tomorrow! She'll be so crushed. No, you can't cancel your big anniversary celebration! You're right. Then, could you go for me? Around the world? Uh... who are you again? Oh yeah, you're from the Outpatient Department. Yes. I'm Taguchi from Indefinite Complaints. Professor Udo can't make it, so I'm here in his place. Is that so? Well then... I guess you'll do. Come in. Excuse me. This is Dr. Kiryu, surgeon and assistant professor. Yes, I know. Pleasure. Please be seated. Are you familiar with the Batista surgical procedure? I've heard of it. The average rate of success is about 60 percent. But in the year since Dr. Kiryu has been with us... we've had an incredible streak of 26 straight successes. We have patients coming to him from all over. And yet the past three operations have ended in failure. We want Professor Udo... I mean, you... to find out why. I can't. I wish you would. We have a big. secret operation coming up. Isn't that the job of the Risk Management Committee? We'd like to keep it quiet. What's more, I know almost nothing about surgery. Precisely what we want, a non-specialist. For this procedure, I'm required to temporarily stop the heart. In a sense, I kill a patient. I felt the last three operations went perfectly. Yet for some unknown reason, they all died. DC! Lidocaine! You can't understand the fear I felt unless you'd been there. I don't ever want to experience, that fear again. I'll send you all the data. I'm so glad you've agreed to help us. See you in O.R. I don't know if I can be of any help. Don't worry. I have a strong feeling you will be. How so? Excuse me. Here's the data. That much? You're kidding? Playing happily with her friends is 3rd grader Mana Yoshimura. A year ago, she was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, an enlarged heart... and a life-threatening disease. She required a heart transplant. But organ transplants in children are not allowed in Japan. What Mana needed... was a miracle. It came in the form of cardiosurgeons at Tojo Medical University. And its leader, Batista surgeon Dr. Kyoichi Kiryu. "A healthy heart" "A healthy heart" Cardiomyopathy stretches the heart so it can't pump blood efficiently. Cardiomyopathy stretches the heart so it can't pump blood efficiently. "Dilated cardiomyopathy” Cardiomyopathy stretches the heart so it can't pump blood efficiently. "Dilated cardiomyopathy” In the Batista procedure, a portion of the heart tissue is removed... and re-sewn in a shrunken size to restore systolic function. Dr. Kiryu spent over a decade in the US as a cardiac surgeon. And has earned the nickname "Mister Perfect". He now heads a team made up of Japan's top cardiac specialists. His right-hand man is Dr. Yuji Kakitani, a coronary bypass expert. Second in command is Toshiki Sakai, a rising star in the field. Providing cool and collected support is anesthesiologist, Koichiro Himuro. Takayuki Haba mans the heart-lung machine while the heart is stopped. Nurse Kyoko Hoshino wields dynamic visual acuity and reflexes. Pathologist Ryo Narumi trained with Kiryu in the US He determines the appropriate heart excision. Their groundbreaking work has come to be known as... The "Team Batista Miracle", or "The Glorious Seven". "Frontlines of Medicine: The Team Batista Miracle" "... heart failed to restart." "... death during surgery." "... resuscitation efforts..." "... cause unknown.” "Case 27, Hisae Takada... female, age 54" "Death" "Case 29, male, age 41 ” "Death" "Case 30, male, age 59" "Death" What are you doing? I'm counting the number of strokes in the deceased's names. "Case 28, male, age 9" "Recovering” No problems with child surgery. Kyoichi Kiryu High integrity, sharp... noble-minded. He personally requested this inquiry. His supreme confidence makes him a bit... overbearing, perhaps? As an animal, he'd be... an eagle. "Excels in child surgery?" Excuse me. Doctor? Please knock before entering. I did. The Prajna Sutra on a grain of rice? Dexterity training. It's a surgeon's lifeblood. Is this dexterity training, too? So, am I first on your interrogation list? Did you notice anything different between the 3 fatal cases... and the 27 successful operations? If I did, Dr. Kiryu would've noticed it long before me. It bears repeating that Batista is a high-risk procedure. Most patients have other concurrent illnesses, too. It's a miracle we've been as Successful as we have. The team's scrub nurse was recently replaced, right? From Ms. Hoshino to... Ms. Otomo. Yes, Ms. Hoshino married and left the team. She was a very good nurse. Ms. Otomo doesn't compare. I'm sorry. I must admit that her arrival has thrown off our rhythm a bit. When did she join? Case 27. Case 27 would be... "Death” the first of your failures. First Assistant, Dr. Kakitani is patient and hard-working. Hints at Nurse Otomo's culpability Could he be trying to draw attention away from himself? His animal likeness? A mole. Let me guess what Dr. Kakitani said. I bet he blames Nurse Otomo. He didn't go that far. A person doesn't die because of a different nurse. If you ask me, it's Kakitani who holds us back. He just can't keep up with Dr. Kiryu's pace. Are you saying that Dr. Kakitani could be at fault for the deaths? Dr. Kakitani's role has little to do with the results. It's me and Dr. Kiryu who run the operation. On the other hand. .. Keep this quiet. If anyone were to welcome the failures, it would be kakitani. He was in line for top surgeon when suddenly a ringer from America arrives. Now excuse me. We don't have the luxury of getting paid to listen to people complain. Second Assistant Sakai... pompous and insecure. Kisses up to Dr. Kiryu, looks down on Dr. Kakitani. He's a Spitz. "Yip yip!” It's my fault. They all think so, right? I can't blame them, you know. I have bad timing. My fumbling irritates Dr. Kiryu. No matter how hard I try... I'll never be Nurse Hoshino. Nurse Otomo... without any prompting, broke into tears. Emotional? Dramatic? Perhaps by intent? A shellfish. "What's a cardiopulmonary bypass?" You're kidding, right? You know we stop the heart, right? This replaces the heart and lungs, circulating blood to the body. In layman's terms, it's a "pump". I feel sorry for Nurse Otomo. Do you also think she could be to blame? No idea. I'm fixed on this. Excuse me. Yeah? I told you this morning! That's not what I said! That's right. I want sashimi for dinner tonight. My wife. Despite what you may think, I love her with all my heart. Perfusion Technologist Haba... mild-mannered in appearance. But harbors a Jekyll and Hyde quality. As an animal, he'd be... a chameleon. Who is that? Arnold Agapi, West African child soldier. He was treated for a bullet wound, and found to have cardiomyopathy. He may be a child, but he's also an anti - American guerilla. The U.S. won't treat him. So our Team Batista got the call. We will do everything in our power to ensure that Arnold... receives the best treatment by our Batista team. So this was the big secret. You'll start to feel sleepy. Breathe deeply. Have a minute, Dr. Himuro? Uh, wait downstairs. I'll be right there. Here. Thank you. It's my lunch. Is this enough? My body will only accept drinks or ice-cream. You must be exhausted. On the verge of death. The Batista surgery must be especially hard. Actually, that's easy. I'm working with the best. Multiple operations are what's hard. Anesthesiology is slave labor. Overworked and understaffed. Sometimes 5 cases a day. Isn't that dangerous? You can say that again. Not a winner. I'm sorry. I've got to run. Just one more question. Notice anything different in pre-or post-operation? I gave that some thought, but nothing came to mind. But the next case is a child, so it'll be okay. Isn't a child more difficult... what with the smaller heart? You'd think so, but child surgery is Dr. Kiryu's forté. Apparently so. Anesthesiologist Himuro... perennially busy and fatigued. Serious and dedicated to his work. I'd label him... a mountain goat. I locate the degenerative part, of the heart with Dr. Kiryu... and determine what to remove. "Degenerative?" I take and freeze a sample from the excision... and make a 4-micron section. I then dye the section and observe it under a microscope... to confirm if we've removed the degenerative portion. Did you notice anything different with the 3 failed operations? I'd even say they went better than usual. What, this? I was a surgeon, too, until a careless mistake in O.R. So I switched to pathology. Dr. Narumi, I hear that Dr. Kiryu is your brother-in-law. You've worked as a team since America, right? Exactly. So... any idea who the killer is? "The killer?" You think this is a homicide, right? When did I say that? Am I wrong? Pathologist Narumi... hypothesizes murder as the cause. The animal he most resembles? A coyote. "Case 31” Pardon me. Let's intubate. Laryngoscope. Tube. Don't you need a roll call before an operation? What for? How many people are here? Doctors Kiryu and Narumi aren't here yet so... six. 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7! Then we have an intruder. Who are you? An "intruder", huh? Thanks a lot. Dean Kurosaki? Doctors Kakitani and Sakai... I needn't remind you of the importance of today's procedure. Give it your best. Yes, Sir. Why can't he just watch from the monitor room? Good luck, doctors. Let's do it. Let's begin. Yes, doctor. Scalpel. Gauze. Electric scalpel. Retractor. Saw. Testing. Stop ventilator. Stopping. There it is. Mayo scissors. Tubes. Cardiopulmonary tubes. Aortic stitch. Aortic cannula. "Heart-lung machine” Ready, Doctor. Good luck. Good luck. It's larger that I expected. Left Anterior Descending? Is it excisable? OK, it's a go. Apply clamp. Clamp. Flow down. Flow down. Clamp in place. Backup. Backup. Cardioplegia injection. Cardioplegia injection! Understood. It's stopped. Yes, Doctor. Scalpel. Scalpel. Metzen scissors. Sorry. Here's your specimen. Here, Doctor. Let's stitch it up. Warm him up. - Wrong way! - Stay focused! More light. The needle holder. Mayo scissors. Completed. Division is fine. Aortic declamping. Temperature? 95 degrees. Flow down. Flow down. Take him off bypass. Backup. Ventilator back on. Backup. No pulse yet. Temperature and potassium? 95.9 and potassium level fine. No pulse, Doctor. Relax, Sakai. Colonic temperature, 96.8! We have rhythm! Good work! You did it! Let's lower the HLM flow. Yes, Sir. Go wash up, Nurse Otomo. He's here. Dean Kurosaki has emerged from the operating room. How did it go? Excuse my appearance. It was a difficult operation, but we were successful. When do you expect Arnold's release? I really can't hazard a guess right now. What a relief. For a moment there, I was thinking, "not again." I thought my heart would stop. Is that a joke? Time! Concentrate. One hit and we lose. I know. Play ball! Time! Who're you? You can't just come on the field during a game, mister. I see. Shall we say, "pinch hitter Shiratori” then? Is that okay? What? Understood. Go ahead, Sir. Go ahead. Play ball! Strike! Ball! Ball. That was a ball. Ball. Say what? Ball. You'd better not be jerking us around, creep. A little more heat, please. When did you start having trouble breathing? After busting my nose in the ring. My doc says I'm fine. But it is harder to breathe. Yeah. Maybe my lung's deformed. I've been kicked and punched a lot. Ultrasound? You know how birds can hear frequencies humans can't? Maybe our neighborhood "Edison" is sending out... some kind of anti-crow frequency. And my ears are picking it up. T've made it clear want dinner at 6:30 every night. But nothing's ready by then. Maybe she's busy. No, she's on the phone with friends. I'll ask, "Is dinner ready yet?", she says, "Why not take a bath first?" It's only after I'm undressed that I notice there's no water in the tub. Perhaps she forgot to fill it. It's on purpose. She wants me to die of pneumonia. Next patient, please. You... I just have to know. Excuse me? In a restaurant, what the people, at the next table are eating. Or what someone on a cell phone, is talking about. I feel like I have to know so many things. This gentleman is not a patient. What? "Keisuke Shiratori, Secretariat, Ministry of Health and Labor" That explains everyone's kowtowing. I guess to most folks, we live in the clouds. What do you want? I'm here to save you. Excuse me? You were told to find out why a series of Batista operations... ended in failure. But you found nothing and gave up. I didn't "give up". I concluded that the cause was unknown. But what's that got to do with you? The Director asked me to look into it. We go way back. What, he came? A word of warning. Guard your feelings when talking to him. God's speed. Hello? Something's terribly wrong with Team Batista. The last surgery went exceedingly well. T'm not talking about medical, blunders. I'm talking murder. Murder? There's a murderer among them. I read your flimsy little report. It's a masterpiece... I'm impressed. The good-natured doctor of psychosomatic disorders... writes her "summer diary.” Can i toss him out? I love your animal analogies. It was enormously helpful in preparing a real investigation. A "real investigation"? Another round of questioning. What you did was "passive hearing." You sat and listened. Even a monkey can do that. I plan to do "active hearing". In short, aggressive inquiry. Sorry to keep you. You're from the Health Ministry? I'm Shiratori. Can you keep it short? I'm pretty busy. I'd be glad to. I'm even busier. What would you like to know? I understand you opposed bringing Dr. Kiryu here from the U.S. Of course. I'm duty bound to promote Dr. Kakitani from inside. I'm in charge of the surgical, department. The Director was meddling in my internal affairs. Then I suppose you object to Dr. Kiryu's success. Sorry to disappoint. But I'm not much of an axe-grinder. True. You're quickness to adapt is well-known. Your press interviews make it sound like you invited him. Some say you're looking to ride his coattails to personal success. Now who would say that? Dr. Taguchi here. Get out! Out! I said no such thing! But you thought it. It's the same thing. How is this helping? We only succeeded in angering him. This is "active hearing,” and it gained us plenty. We can now strike him from the list of suspects. He's just an attention seeker and a grump. A small man. Enter. Excuse us. This is the rice grain? Who're you? Mr. Shiratori's from the Ministry of Health. I've got just a couple of Batista questions. I've told Dr. Taguchi everything I know. l'll be brief and direct. You orchestrated the surgery's failure, didn't you? There is a motive, since you were being tapped as lead surgeon. But then Dr. Kiryu arrived from America to block your career. You hoped to undermine him by having his Batista method fail. Perfectly understandable. He's younger, more handsome. And a much better surgeon. Dr. Taguchi... It's not me. I'll be filing a protest with your superior, Professor Udo. Your days here are numbered. Why'd you do that? Dr. Kakitani is not our culprit. Then why say such nasty things? To observe his expressions. He hid them well, but he was definitely angry. You want to question Dr. Sakai and Nurse Otomo together? Note how they respond to each other's grilling. So you chose the nurse's dressing room where she's most relaxed. No, I've just always wanted to see a nurse's dressing room. You're scum, aren't you? What's the idea? I'm real busy. I'm Shiratori from the Ministry of Health and Labor. Please. I'll get right to it. Did you eat this? No. I'm relieved. I wouldn't expect you to have an appetite. Patients have been dying ever since you replaced Nurse Hoshino. How dare you? I'm not asking you. How's about it, Ms. Otomo? What would you like me to say? Do you feel remorse? Remorse for what? She didn't cause the operations to fail. I told you that. I said I'm not asking you. Please wait your turn. I feel inadequate, yes, but not remorse. No remorse? That people have died? How surprising! It wasn't my fault! Everybody says so. "Everybody"? Who's "everybody”? Me! I'm not asking you! Then let me go! Nurse Otomo? I don't see any tears. - I can't be silent! - You haven't been! Taguchi, we've been through all this already! A little mis-timing by a nurse won't kill a patient! I agree... if surrounded by a talented staff. What? You speak ill of Dr. Kakitani, but your surgical technique is deplorable. How would you know? Video. I've seen every operation. Video? Dr. Taguchi, every Batista procedure is recorded. You didn't know that? Deplorable? Yes, I don't know how Dr. Kiryu puts up with it. Dr. Kakitani's a mole. You're a dog that just barks. And Ms. Otomo was what again? A clam? No! I mean, I didn't say that. I see why Nurse Hoshino quit. Or maybe Ms. Otomo... you harassed her into quitting. Why are you eating both udon and soba noodles? I'm not. The udon is a side dish for my soba. When did you watch all the Batista videos? I haven't ... not yet. A bluff? Our technical term is "offensive hearing". For angering and insulting people? Human relationships are key to solving murder cases. If there is a single cause to these deaths, then I want to discover it. But I don't believe it's murder. Believe what you want. But another patient will die. I'm leaving for Florida. The next surgery is in a week. I'll be back by then. Congratulations! Look this way! Modern medicine has the power to... transcend borders and religious or racial differences. I'm proud that we were able to demonstrate that with our own hands. Way to go, Arnold! Congratulations! Congratulations! Good luck! What do you think of my face, Dr. Taguchi? This face that has lost one of its moles. Well... Two. One. Two. One. With... Without. With... Without. I like it... without. Right? As a matter of fact... people have been telling me I look younger. Come in. Excuse me. Nurse Otomo... come for a cry? Mr. Ogura's Batista procedure is tomorrow. He's a bit nervous. We're preparing him for anesthesia soon. I'm told this is the place to come for things like this. Dr. Kiryu is a brilliant surgeon. You're in great hands. Yes, I'm sure you're right. Here you are. If the surgery goes well, I'd like to fulfill a dream from my youth. Really? What dream is that? Promise you won't laugh? Of course. Rock'n roll. With a healthy heart, I can sing out loud, right? I'll get up on stage with a guitar, and scream and shout and jump. And sing with such passion, sparks will fly. Will that be possible? Of course. But I can't guarantee stardom. Will you be my judge? ♪ I take a lemon and squeeze it hard ♪ So you'll have some zest... in your tea ♪ We share a cup of lemon tea ♪ My lemon... is so ripe It seems about to burst ♪ But I make sure that every drop... goes in your tea ♪ Nothing beats a cup of lemon tea ♪ Let me add... a little flavor... to your reddish tea ♪ A little color... of lemon yellow... to your pekoe ♪ Everyday I drink a cup of lemon tea ♪ A Liberal dose... of sugar... slowly stirred ♪ Hurry... before it cools... I wait for you, desperately ♪ A sweet and sour cup of lemon tea Another patient will die. Thank you. You've given me the courage to face my surgery. The anesthetic is administered from the day before? Of course not. Just an epi catheter. A catheter is inserted to administer the anesthetic during surgery. It lets us control the pain after operation, too. After the operation? Yes, after your successful operation. Dr. Taguchi. You'll be present at the surgery, right? Yes. Good, because I'm even more perplexed than ever. I can detect no difference between the successes and failures. It'll work out, Doctor. Okay. Mr. Ogura? Mr. Ogura! Emergency! Mr. Ogura? Mr. Ogura? What happened? A seizure. He's going into Surgеrу пOW. Mr. Ogura! It's Shiratori. I've just arrived at Narita. Florida was very fruitful. Mr. Ogura's been taken into emergency surgery! No, he can't! Call it off! I can't! Just suspend it! Aortic stitch, please. Needles. Towel clip. "Case 32” Dr. Kiryu? Good luck. Piece of cake. The easiest case yet. Okay. It's a go. Let's clamp it. Clamp, please. Specimen's out. Here, Sir. Stitch and felt. - Careful. - Sorry. No problem. Perfect. Stitching complete. Perfect here, too. Taking him off bypass. 96.8. Flow down. Flow down. He's off bypass. Backup. Ventilator on. Backup complete. Temperature? 96.8. Doctor... pulse isn't coming. Dr.Kiryu? Dr. Himuro, pacing. Start at 30. VOO... with pacing rate of 30. Output of 5. Raising output to 10. Output at max. He's gone into VF. DC defibrillator! Hurry! Calm down. Charge the DC! 20 Joules! Charge OK. Ready, go! VF again. Go again. Using beta blockers. DC to 30. Charge. Charge. Charged. Ready, go! Shut off the machine. Close him up. I need to know the cause. Request a postmortem. An autopsy because we stopped the heart and couldn't return it? We can't ask his family for that. Okay, nobody leaves. We examine the body. Not under these conditions. Autopsy imaging is non-invasive. Autopsy? An MRI on a corpse? It's got Ministry and Pathology Society approval. If we don't do this now, our chance of finding the cause is lost forever. Are you crazy? This is for the living! If people found out a corpse... I've cleared it with your boss, though he wasn't happy. It's established practice in the U.S. I see nothing wrong. Not yet. There's nothing. There has to be. Expand the view beyond the surgical area with a coronal image. The heart and stomach is plenty! From the apex of the lung to the head! Screw you! The killer is challenging us. Did you notice anything during the operation? I finally understand what you said before. You can't understand the fear you feel... unless you've been there. When's the next one? I think... the 16th. In four days. I told her "Dishes should first be washed in a bowl... instead of letting the tap run". I mean, I try not to interfere. But her method was wasteful. I merely made a suggestion. You wouldn't believe how she reacted to that. You were just trying to help, but she called you a "nag". I'm sorry. No, that's OK. I'm always griping to you about the same thing. I'm sure you've got your problems, too. DC defibrillator! Hurry! Calm down. He lives here? I didn't tell you about Florida. How was Disneyland? Dr. Kiryu and Dr. Narumi worked at a heart disease clinic in Florida. They formed a surgical duo. Do you know how Dr. Narumi scarred his hand? A mistake during operation. Yes, by Dr. Kiryu. A big traffic accident had them both operating at full tilt, simultaneously. In the turmoil, Dr. Kiryu mistakenly cut Dr. Narumi's wrist... deeply. Dr. Kiryu did? The man who ended Narumi's career as a surgeon... was Dr. Kiryu himself. Well, shall we resume our questioning? At this hour? Dr. Narumi? No, you Dr. Taguchi. OK then. This here's a puzzle. We know the fatalities are being caused in surgery. The culprit's access to the patient is a necessary condition. We can narrow it down to two lines. First, there is direct physical tampering with the heart. Your move. Oh, really? Well, Dr. Kiryu requested the investigation. Continue. Not Dr. Narumi. What, you kidding me? You're unbelievable. He's got a prime motive. He resents Dr. Kiryu. He doesn't seem to. Plus, he doesn't touch anything. OK, how about these two? Before Dr. Kiryu starts his Batista procedure... the operating table is manned by only these two. Co-conspirators, eh? That would make sense. Co-conspirators? One covering for the other. Could be the only way. Nah... I doubt it. There's one more person who doesn't leave the table. Nurse Otomo? If all three are involved, it's possible. Like a strong Bridge hand. .. high and low cards. A three-way conspiracy. What's their shared motive? There is none. Precisely. Can a surgeon this skilled really cut another surgeon's hand? But it happened. So Dr. Narumi has it out for Dr. Kiryu, then? Rumor is Narumi was even better than Kiryu. Until the door was slammed. Appearances aside, I can't see him doing nothing. Dr.Kiryu places his full trust in Dr. Narumi. He lets him determine the excision. He's a pathologist. Dr. Kiryu doesn't even look. I doubt that. He closes his eyes. Hello? What is it now? Dr. Kiryu... it's Taguchi. Kiryu here. Understood. l'll be there. Any pain? I'm OK. Don't worry about me. How can you not, right? Any throbbing in your side? No, it's fine. Please, take a seat. We have surgery tomorrow. Pathologist Ryo Narumi, "hypothesizes... murder"? Only you have pointed out this possibility. Why? I have a wild imagination. More like a preemptive move by a person hiding something. Oh, good. I got lost. I haven't been down here in years. Director... over there. I see. Haven't sat here in years, either. So... did you find something? I sure have... the culprit. Let's begin. What can these possibly tell you that's new? Incredible work. The Glorious Team Batista's commemorative first case. Next please. We jump far ahead to Case 26. Nurse Hoshino's last gig as a scrub nurse. Look closely. There, you take a break. Afterwards, your technique grows more meticulous. Next. Next is Case 27, the first operational fatality. Terrible workmanship. The first one with Nurse Otomo. Let's move on. Next we skip to Case 29. The second fatality. Again, you're off your technique and rhythm. Wait. What? There's no visual. It's Case 29. Kyoichi... Dr. Kiryu? What? We're watching Case 29. Without video. Dr. Kiryu... Yes? Down here, Doctor. Kiryu... you can't ... See it, right? This is a farce. Let's go. Come on! Your diagnosis is correct. My vision is limited. Kyoichi! It's narrow angle glaucoma. The lower half of my field of vision.. is clouded. The symptoms began in Florida. Like a short power outage. But they grew more frequent, and the vision loss spread. Until one day... it all turned white. It's a bit larger than we thought. The degeneration spreads to the anterior descending branch. You can remove it. It was a miracle. When Ryo described the excisable region. .. it was like the white cloud had lifted. Then a voice in my head said. .. "You can still do this. You can go on." You should've laid down your scalpel. There are so many patients waiting for their turn. They've waited months and years. Turned down everywhere and in despair, they've come to us. Do you think I can just tell them that due to my condition. .. I can no longer help them? Why did you request the investigation yourself? I guess to test my luck. To prove to myself that the recent failures were not my fault. At least I wished so. If the cause originated elsewhere, I could still continue my work. Your eyes are in no condition to perform surgery. You should've laid down your scalpel. Why should he? You still won't find a better team in the country, no, the world... than the one the two of us put together. A doctor who can't see, and a doctor who can't operate. Together, they're whole. It's time you set your brother-in-law free, Dr. Narumi. What's that mean? You're capitalizing on Dr.Kiryu's dedication toward his patients. How's that? By not facing the truth... by trying to continue as a surgeon through him. You're inviting disaster with your delusions of grandeur. We'd still be on our way up. If it weren't for you... if it weren't for you! You're to blame! Stop! Dr. Kiryu's hands are not yours. Ryo... enough. Forget it. The "Glorious Team Batista" is little more than a club... of broken physicians picking up each other's pieces. What you two did amounts to murder. No matter the reason, you should've laid down your scalpel. I'm sure you've heard. I thought of disbanding our team after my final surgery. Instead, it represents a brand, new start for Team Batista... under Doctor Kakitani. What? Me? Yes. Your work is steady and sure. And you're calm under pressure. I've seen you perform a coronary bypass. And it was flawless. Will you do it, Dr. Kakitani? Yes. I'll be giving Dr. Kakitani support for this procedure. I expect you'll do the same. "Case 33" "Case 33" Flush, please. It's done. I'm giving you a local anesthetic. Let's begin. Scalpel. Good luck. Towel clip. It's bigger than expected. But in decent condition. It touches the LAD, but within limiter range. OK, let's go. Start the bypass. Aortic clamp. Flow down. Specimen excised. Here, Doctor. Let's stitch her up. Aortic stitch. Don't space out, Sakai. No... sorry. Margin checks out. Perfect. Stitching done. I'm declamping. Temperature? 96.2. Flow down. Flow down. She's off bypass. Backup. Ventilator back on. Backup. Pulse isn't coming. Temperature, potassium. 96.4, potassium level fine. Doctor... Patience, Sakai. There it is. I'm going to wash up. Keep monitoring. Superb work. Thank you. Easy now. Congratulations. Congratulations. This is a clean area. Change before entering. Congratulations. Let's see now... Examiner Shiratori? We know what killed Mr. Ogura. Remember we took an MRI of his body after the surgery? We photographed a section of his head. To the chagrin of some, I might add. But we went ahead... and found this. What is this? The brain is skewed. How can this happen? Someone here applied pressure near his brain-stem. That's ridiculous. How is that possible? Epi catheter. Correct. Through epidural anesthesia. Excuse me? But my blood test would detect any powerful drugs. I didn't say a drug, I said "pressure to the brain-stem". How? Inhalation anesthetic. It's used as a gas but... it starts as a liquid. This is it, right, Dr. Himuro? He drew the anesthetic in its Tiquid form into a syringe. And injected it into the epi catheter. Inhalation anesthetic in the catheter? If injected in the peridural space... it would turn to gas and put pressure on the skull. Causing a brain hernia or cerebral hemorrhage. Absolutely fatal. Come on. Do you have any proof that Dr. Himuro did it? Good point. The inhalation anesthesia used during surgery... should be detected in the blood. Then how? Dr Himuro planned to employ the same method today, too. But prior to surgery, Dr. Taguchi replaced the syringe. This one, in which we found liquid inhalation anesthetic. So that's why she didn't die. On my authority, I'm issuing a state of emergency. Kakitani will keep the surgical staff in order. While Mr. Shiratori deals with the police. Sakai, summon Dean Kurosaki... Otomo, the Head Nurse. Dr. Himuro... Why? Don't waste your breath. He's no longer human. Why would you do this? Why shouldn't I do it? Everyone needs an amusement. It was for "amusement"? Seeing everyone panic when the heartbeat doesn't return... is incredibly exciting. It's like... a carnival. No one ever requested an autopsy. The best way to kill a person and go scott free is to do it... in front of a surgeon. You caused Mr.Ogura's emergency operation because.. you knew Mr. Shiratori would be returning soon. I gave him stomach medicine to set off an allergic reaction. But no children died. Did you want to spare them? This facility doesn't use epi catheters on children. I couldn't, that's all. I believed you, Dr. Taguchi, would end this game. You pay attention to people, and things others abandon. I should've noticed your SOS for help when we first met. The police will arrive shortly. I should thank you. You'll help my Ministry strengthen its administrative oversight powers. Words cannot express our shock and dismay to learn that a physician. .. with intent to harm patients had lurked among us undetected. We grieve for the victims and their families. We are so truly sorry. Doctor? Your patients are waiting. I'm in no condition to see them. Give me a couple minutes. Anything I can do? I'll be fine. Doctor? You all right? It's not my place to say so, but you look tired. Cheer up. Today, we'll listen to all your complaints. Dr. Taguchi. Dr. Kiryu! I've finally put down my scalpel. The victims were my responsibility. I plan to carry that burden with me. But I wanted to make sure I thanked you. Thank you. Not at all. Take care. Maybe I'll come for an "unidentified complaint" checkup myself. Please do. So long. Strike! Batter out! Here to strengthen administrative oversight for a softball team? I came to save you. No thank you. In another pinch, I see. Mind your own business.
