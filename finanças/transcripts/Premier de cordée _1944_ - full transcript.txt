This film was restored by PATHE in 2017 This film relating the courage and feats of mountain guides was shot on location in the Alps without any special effects. Off again, Ravanat? Old mules never stop, Ezian. It'll be sunny, but you may find snow. I can take fresh snow. Les Grandes Jorasses? La Verte? Les Droites? Just let me guide you, Mr Hubert. Two days from retiring, old Ravanat can lead a group as well as younger men. You have stamina. 60 in two days. And young as ever. But they take the rules seriously down below. It's kind of you, Mr Hubert, to arrange this climb to comfort me. My last. My last as a guide. We're right above Aline's farm. We might see her. Forget Aline, Georges. She's at the Servettaz party. - We were invited too. - Yes. Come on. We'll reach the hut by 4. A stroll today, but tomorrow... Or tonight rather. You won't forget this, sir. Tell me, won't Jean Servettaz think you did it on purpose? Did what? Picked the very day he opens his new hotel. Certainly not. Jean Servettaz is glad to do more relaxing work. A fine climb awaits. Yes. It'll be an early start. The sun can soften the snow in the corridors. It's notjust the climb up. We have to come back down. L'll jump- Go around the crevasse. Don't jump, I said! - Respect the mountains. - He'll learn. It's a trade of responsibility and planning. - Hi, Alfred. Have you finished? I'm off to Corsica soon. Let's have a drink. The bar, always the bar. I leave the mountains with a broken leg, get an office job, and now drink is the danger! - Hello. - The rate for Mont Blane? 800. And a porter, 500. We carry our own gear. It's obligatory for a party's safety. Damn telephone... - May I? - Of course. What? You want Jean Servettaz? Our best man. You've come from Norway to climb Les Drus? No, he's not available today. He's inaugurating his new chalet, his hotel. Jean Servettaz is our friend, a master for us all. And the pride of Chamonix. He has taught us, not in words, because he doesn't talk much, but in deeds, which is better. The day he changes trades, I drink to his health. Prosperity and long life! And to Marie too. Good health, Jean. Your friendship touches me. As Maxime said, talk isn't my thing. No words, action. Suzanne, six more bottles. The ones on the left with blue caps, the reserve. MY 'turn! - I raise my glass to my nephew. - Quiet! Let Uncle Paul speak. In the Servettaz family, Pierre marks a change of course. He'll be a hotelier, like me. A fine trade. After hotel school, he'll train in Europe's best establishments. But he'll come back to us. Jean and Marie Servettaz's hotel will be the transition. I'll retire one day. By then, Pierre will have met the young woman who will bring elegance to my hotel, the Continental. But we'll see... Here's to Pierre, the hotel business, progress... To mountains and open bottles! These innkeepers can talk. They never stop! Start the dance with Aline. Yes, just a minute. You can't beat Napoleon's cow. She's ruled for two years now. When the cows fight, my Lionne will show them. She's still young, but once she's in her prime... Napoleon has Boucle. No other cow can beat her. We'll shut Napoléon up. In a season or two, when the cows choose their queen, you'll see. It's rustic, clean and bright. Not luxurious, but there's a clientele. Eight rooms, four doubles. If you'd started early like me, you'd be less tired and better off. I have no regrets. I'm still not done with the mountains. This is Pierre's room for now. If you had no regrets, you'd let your son choose. They're having fun. Let's cut a rug. Give me a minute, Paul. I'm joining Ravanat. Not today. - It's his last climb. - So? You chose the day I gather my friends on purpose. The son climbs, with his father safe at home? You can't teach me. I don't plan to, but I said I'd go. You can't refuse. You'd only bear a grudge if I did. I don't already? When you're at hotel school, you'll forget the mountains. Never! I cherish them. They're my life. I know the mountains. They ruin you. Spare me your nonsense. Nonsense? So, your honour as a guide, your career, that's nonsense? Why raise me here only to tear me away? You'll obey me just as I obeyed my father. And be a coward? I'm a coward for opening this hotel? You've proved yourself. Enough, Pierre! You'll never be a guide. That's all. Believe me, it's for your own good. If you'd been sent away at 20, would you have said that? I was a fool. You're proud of having been that fool. And I was proud to hear about your climbs. Do you know why I told you? Shall I tell you? To put you off. Pierre, look at Uncle Paul and his hotel. A fine legacy. - I prefer yours. - No. Be reasonable. I won't back down. But I won't rush you. So I can.. Of course. As an amateur, now and then. Go and join Ravanat. Pierre! Where are you going? It's wrong, sneaking off. I feared you'd be angry. What for? Relenting. No one could force you. Aline, would you agree to marry an office clerk? A valley man who runs no risks, far from the summits' air? You wouldn't. When I'm up there, I'm not away from you. The mountains and you are one for me. If I lose one, I'll lose the other. Aline, have I lost you? Don't linger, Pierre. Go and join Ravanat. Beautiful. Yes, but you forget that at their foot. Our work's cut out tomorrow. Old Ravanat can still climb rocks. Servettaz took me there 10 years ago. I was there too, 25 years ago. But not with Servettaz. With a client who gave me a scare. Fear is like vertigo, we all experience it. Those who claim not to know it are liars or forgetful. Pierre... You're here? - You left the others? - I was bored. With us tomorrow? With you! Bravo. They've come from Norway just to do Les Drus with you. They want Jean Servettaz. They insist. You can't refuse. I knew it. You accept. The last one, of course. Or second to last. All right. Marie... I promised, but I still have the poison in my blood. Pierre too. If they'd forced you... They should have. You let him join Ravanat anyway. He didn't ask. It's the last time. Despite him, despite Aline... Aline is a fine girl, not spoiled by learning. He's under her thumb. Even if it's hard, he ought to be happy. You can get over anything when you're young. Mountaineering and the rest. This makes it worth it. Never bored once in a thousand days like this. Look down there. Our tracks on the glacier. It's all so far, the valley, men, trains, others... Look at these crests, peaks and ridges. We can only be happy close to them. Come on, lads, let's not tarry. We have to hurry. The sun softens the snow in the corridors. I'll cut the steps. That's my job. All right then. - Belay me, Georges. - Go on. Look out, rocks! Damn mountain. Hurry, Pierre. Watch out! Steady, Georges! White shirts in the right-hand drawer. Here you are. I'm helping sort Pierre's linen. What news? Pierre will be discharged next month. Then he'll start his course as soon as possible. What's that look for? Jean, you're harsh. You think I'll change my mind? Pierre will be upset. It's not enough? Pierre five weeks ago and now Georges injured! Any news? They're bringing him back. Frostbite in his feet. His client? Dead of cold. Don't you understand now? Marie, you know. Tell her. They're the risks of the trade. - So you don't love Pierre. - I do. Didn't Marie love you? You'd go climbing and she'd wait. I can wait too. If you loved him for himself, you'd be on my side. And help him forget. I love him where he was born. I love a local man, a mountaineer. When he gets a good job, you'll change your mind. Besides, you're not even engaged yet. He won't leave me. You're giving him those ideas. Sorry, dear, but Pierre's going away. Can I get up? Get up? Three weeks after trephination? Don't rush things, my boy, if you want to recover fully. Fully? No after-effects and my faculties restored? Of course. You swear? A doctor never swears. But I can say, without complications, which are unlikely, you'll recover. Hello, doctor. Hello, Aline. Visiting our patient? The best medicine. A book too? The Great Climbs. No, only simple novels or thrillers that won't feed his obsession. I'll keep The Great Climbs for now. Doctor... Can ltell him about Georges? He'll soon find out. Let's avoid secrets. A call from the guides' office. The injured man's on his way. Room 26, next to Pierre. Does the surgeon know? He's coming, doctor. Aline, here at the clinic, I've been thinking. I've found the strength to resist. Father can't take what keeps me alive. It's hard disobeying Jean Servettaz. Even as a Servettaz, stubborn like him. You'll see, Aline. You're not very confident. Partly. Will Georges visit today? I have some bad news. Georges fell in a crevasse. - Is he dead? - No. They've rescued him, but he spent all night in the cold. He's on his way down. Georges, my best pal. Hurry and find out how he is. If he and Boule hadn't held steady... Go right away, Aline. - Where's the ambulance? - It must be on the way. You've come, Aline. Poor Aline, I'm done for. Frostbite in my feet. They'll have to amputate. A mutilated, legless cripple. Georges now, Pierre a month ago. AS if... Pierre will manage. The hotel trade accepts infirmity. But me... The car is here. Don't despair, Georges, nothing is final. - It'd take a miracle. - Miracles happen. You know about them, Aline. Let's hurry and make breakfast, mother. Pierre's gone to see Aline. There's no stopping him now. - Let me help. - A guest! - I'd like to! - All right. Whip this cream for me. Pierre loves it. You pamper him. I was so scared for five months. You're reassured now. A bit too much so. The fresh snow is pretty. We'll never agree on that. It reminds me of the men up there. What an animal! Don't be so tough on her. He's like a child with his cow. Don't worry, Lionne will make us rich. Unless she ruins us. Mend the barn roof instead. It keeps leaking. I'll see to the roof. Pierre can help now he's better. - You? - The two of us. With my orthopaedic shoes, I'll be dancing soon. Let's not waste time. Coming? Come on, Pierre. Bravo, Georges! He impresses me. Remember when he left the hospital? He could barely walk. Well? Stay there, Pierre. I'll bring the shingles. It's vertigo. The rock damaged your inner ear. Poor balance, beware. No more summits, all right? Just pastures, snow and easy climbs. If you're well accompanied. And, above all, never as party leader. You could collapse without warning. It's bad for a guide, not for a hotelier. I see now. It's a conspiracy. My family have talked to you. I'm not stupid. I'll soon be guiding again. You're mistaken, son. I'm in league with no one. It's just sound advice. That's all. So, it's incurable? At your age, we can't say. Perhaps... No... Doctors know nothing. I have to find out myself. That's easy to do. One attempt will suffice. Just Dean out from a rooftop. Then we'll know. And if I fall, fine! You must fight, Pierre. You must resist. You must overcome. You must fight, Pierre. You must resist. You must overcome. You know now. You can't be liable for a client. His Hie is sacred. You'll never be a real guide. A real guide... What? What, sir? I'm not a real guide? I'll show you. Here, sir, take this rope. It's just a short passage. Mind the rope doesn't tangle. The drop? Ajoke. Vertigo? You control it, sir. Show willpower, like me. Watch howl do it. No... No, run, sir. I want out! I want to save my hide! Careful, the mountains are mad! They're dancing! No, sir, do as I do. On your knees. Crawl! Fall, sir, too bad for you. A hotelier isn't liable for anyone's life. Well? No news. The others haven't seen him today. I'm not fooled. - I'm scared. - Scared? Since his convalescence, he won't talk about the future. At 20, Jean, if they'd taken you from the mountains, what would you have done? Always me at 20... I was mad, totally reckless. We'll save him. A little rage and rancour for now. He'll thank us later. It's you, Pierre. Take this. Pierre, what's wrong? Aline, I... You're hiding something. No, on the contrary. What I said before doesn't count. Forget it. I've had enough of the mountains. They won't possess me. My father is right. Hotelier... I'll make more and risk less. Pierre, what's wrong? You make no sense. Your gaze keeps wandering. Explain yourself. I have nothing to explain! I'm changing trades. Isn't that enough? Pierre... Pierre! You'll enjoy this. An expert in wine and climbing. Are you interested too? From my rocking chair. Or in a cable car, at 25 centimes per metre up. Papa, Pierre is back. To your liking? And a bottle, Mum. - An old one. - Hold on. Let me check my roast. I mustn't let the rice stick. This calls for a drink. You'll be pleased, Father. I'll listen to experience. Yes, Pierre Servettaz, son of Jean, son of the famous guide, will be a hotelier. Three glasses for a toast. What's wrong? Aren't you pleased? We know you hate us for it. They all think that. Change your tone. It's insulting. I can forgive your grudge. I wish I was wrong. But there are limits. - You won't... - Calm down. You're not going to argue because you agree. Georges, I'll train you. I have time, now they've retired me. I'll soon get you in shape. First, simple, basic exercises. You think I... No doubt. But dig in, Georges. Watch these vultures. Those shoes are a fine invention for your frozen feet. But courage is worth more than any orthopaedics. No one's better than you to get a man back on his feet. There is someone. Aline. Too bad she... After training, you'll attempt tougher climbs. - Hey there... - Luc! Heard the news? Pierre's gone. Without saying? Without a goodbye? Not even to Aline? He left alone, with his knapsack, like a leper. He'd changed since the operation. He was different. A stranger. Hello? Yes, sir, Hotel Alcazar. Very good. No vacancies until tomorrow, sir. Yes. Yes, a room for two. In what name? Angioletti? Yes, sir. Thank you. Give this to Lady Wilcox. She sails at 6 this evening. Take that down. This isn't a tourist office. All right, sir. Aline, I can't believe it. What luck. Don't tangle the wool. Be careful. A moderate climb doesn't scare me. I did the Aiguille du Plan. I'm so indebted to Ravanat and you. My guardian angels. Don't dream out loud. Aline, remember the guides' office? After my accident? You said, "Miracles happen." I remember. Pierre had sent me. He wanted news of you. So it was Pierre... Some miracles don't happen. They aren't miracles then. Wait... You'll make her dangerous like that. For Napoléon's Boucle. Let her be for more milk. Look at her. Lionne is in great shape. I'd bet my life on her winning. You'll find paper in the lounge to leave a note. Thank you. Pierre! Fancy seeing you in Paris. We were friends. Have I changed that much? Two years since we met. A Parisian now? You're thinner. It's city life. Less sturdy and athletic, of course. May I offer you a drink? - Two whiskies. - No, Perrier for me. You never drank before. Good stamina requires sobriety. Stamina for a hotelier... Been back to Chamonix? No, I've burned my bridges. - And you? - Every season. I've climbed with your father. Still guiding, despite your mother. - Mr Pierre? - Yes? Sorry, 127 is complaining about 128's phonograph. As 128 is a grouch, I don't dare... I'll talk t0128. And Georges' feet? He's made amazing progress, with Ravanafs help. He might actually become a porter again. Aline Lourtier has helped him too. Does she write to you? Aline... Only mountaineers interest her. Her world ends below 2000 m. Let's have dinner on your night off. You need to loosen up a bit. Come on. I'm your father's student, a brother to you. I'm free tomorrow if you want. Such agility. I can't! Come! You're like a brother to me. I didn't tell anyone about it, see. Not even Aline. It's as bad as being a coward. It made me mean, especially with those I loved most. What's wrong, old chap? I have vertigo. Yes, since my accident. I've tried to control it, but I can't. The mountains didn't want me, so I left. You've no idea how I've suffered. Alone, always alone... It's good to talk to a friend. You can cure vertigo. With willpower, like Georges. He felt neither shame nor anxiety. No more whisky, promise me. - Your headaches? - Gone. That's a good sign. Start tomorrow. Come to the gym. I stay in shape all winter. Agreed? It just requires motivation. For the spring migration, you go back, recovered. Your friends, Aline and the mountains mustn't see you in this state. Fernand, is Charette in shape? Great shape. She'll have it tough. I saw Boucle, old Napoléon's cow. She was red-eyed and drooling. Lionne isn't scared. Aline! Aline. Pierre. Pierre, is it you? I was stifling there. Months without... Pierre. Me too, I... So, you hadn't completely forgotten me? You thought of me now and then? Every day, Aline. Even if I tried not to. You left me so badly last time, as if I was at fault. I couldn't explain! Pierre! Look, Pierre is back! The day we least expected him! Pale and elegant. Fresh air will colour his cheeks. Local wine too! And his gang of pals. Douce, owned by Roger Charvaillon, aged four. Whitey, owned by Trulard, aged five. Blacky, from Alfred's herd in Les Houches, aged three. No, four. All right. Beautiful, isn't it? All these animals... They lived wild in the valley in Methuselaws day. Lionne will be queen to lead them to the pastures. And bring them back down in autumn. Animals have laws too. So, no one's interested? Against Napoléon's Boucle? No? No takers over here either? You're scared, aren't you? Come on! Who? One, two... Not so fast, Napoléon. So, there's no one? I'll take up your wager. - 500 francs. - Little upstart! Spendthrift! You want to end up broke? Lionne will trounce your joker. Fine. You'll lose your farm. Don't bet that much! Two minutes to back out. - I won't ruin you. - Like I said, 500. Did you ask your cow? Some are smarter than their masters. I'll wager 500 too. You're crazy. No, I'm backing Lionne. Here, Hyacinthe. Me too, Hyacinthe. 500 francs. 500? Georges, you're in love! 3 times 500 francs. The brats spoil me! But that's all, even if they beg me, candle in hand. I'm no thief. I'll add 500 more. I don't want it. All talk and no guts! Me? You greenhorn! Hyacinthe, three big ones on Boucle. You're clubbing together to make me rich! Fernand, I'll give yours 15 minutes! At the most! Lionne can fight on and on. So you say! The way you left me, Pierre. As if you suddenly hated me. You couldn't understand, Aline. Never a card, never a word. That hurt a lot. Yet you smiled a lot at Georges. Are you jealous? That would have comforted me. Georges was so nice to me. He loves you. I didn't encourage him. Should I make him unhappy to please you? You who abandoned me. But you're back, Pierre. You're here. That's enough. You must know the truth, Aline. I have fewer doubts now. A coward couldn't tell you. A coward? Aline, I... Come closer. There. I'll say it quietly. In a whisper, just for you. The final will be Boucle versus Lionne. Lionne will be tired. She has youth. Boucle has confidence and domination. You'll soon see. They'll keep away from Boucle. Lionne will have no end of fights. She has no chance of winning. - Damn Fernand. - Seen Pierre and Aline? Think I care? This is cow fighting, not flirting. Aline. Aline. If you had told me, Pierre, I would have helped you. It was my role to do so. Have you worked with Mr Hubert? Yes, showing off at the gym. But when it comes to reality, I don't feel ready. It's a beginning though. Perhaps this condition is in your mind. Maybe you're over it without knowing. Shall I train you? Am I your Ravanat? A Ravanat with soft skin and sweet words. Who doesn't smell of tobacco, but flowers. Less strict and experienced. That's a consolation. Go on! Go on, honey! - Don't disturb them. - I'm allowed! - You're not! - What? Your Lionne's losing! - Go on, Boucle! - Let them sort it out. - It's my business! - And mine! Go on! You can't lord it over me! Get lost, beanpole! Damn midget! You don't scare me! - You pesky mosquito! - What? The cows fight, not men! Horns, not fists. Go on, honey! Push harder! You idler! Go on! Go on! Attack! Push harder! You're useless! Go on, honey! Push! Go on, push! I said Fernand's Lionne would win. I can pick a winner. You've shamed me, you minx! Are you dawdling, Pierre? If anything happened to you, I'd be held responsible. Still hesitating? Too bad, I'm off. Aline! Careful, Aline! Hurry, Pierre. Hurry. I'm there. Come on up! Without you, I'd have fallen. You can manage it. No, I can't. I'll never be able to. You were in trouble. But, after, lwas afraid. Afraid, you hear? Aline... Mrs Servettaz. Could I eat at 11? My train is at 12:10. I'll make you an omelette. All right. We expected you two weeks ago. - Work. - My husband was worried. Yes, he told me. And his resolutions? He still promises. A drunk's oath. He managed to put his son off, but can't do it for himself. Seen Les Ravours, Paul? Les Ravours at dawn bring water to the mill. Mont Blanc is clouding over. As long as La Verte is clear. Beware if it covers up. - We carry on? - Yes, for now. 10:40 am. We're making good time. A double bonus if we reach Les Drus half an hour early. Let's go. You should have left me there. Why did Hubert come for me? To make me feel worse? The mountain was spinning. It's hopeless. You can do it, Pierre. I was a bad coach. I was too brusque. I weakened for a minute too. You're not alone. You rushed to save me. I had lost my mind. It's no use. You did it anyway. I promise you, it's possible. You don't mind being a nurse? Don't talk nonsense. - La Verte? - Yes. Its cloud. We turn back. We must descend before the storm. - And my record? - We need to get down. I paid to climb Les Drus. I have to get you back. Guide, I've climbed Europe's highest peaks. I've never turned back. Are Chamonix guides cowards? All right. We'll go, since you insist. At your own risk. Let's go. Keep your mitts at hand, Paul. Excellent. A new record. Let's not waste time. Do you hear bees? Buzzing bees? The storm. Let's hurry down. That's an order, sir. You got Les Drus. You've put us in a fine mess. We've no time to lose. In this murk... Five hours of it. It'll be hard to find our way. Sorry. I spoke harshly, but I didn't think... All rig ht. Later. Come on, let's go. After Grepon and the glacier, he took the same route down. A night with his client at Tour Rouge before the Dent du Géant. Boule, that was you. Did the storm bother you? No, not like Jean Servettaz. Don't worry. His client's in the refuge. They're cosy up there. Seen Pierre? He's probably out. And soaked. It's no better up there. We're way off the normal route. - We go back up? - Too late. The storm. We can always manage with belays. What a trade! All to suit a client... If I started over again... You'd do the same thing. It's a fine trade! I shouldn't have stopped Pierre. Odd I should think of that now we're in this mess. Go on, Paul, slide down. Your turn. Go on. Go on, sir. Don't hesitate. Jump off. Move yourself, dammit. We must descend now. You're mad! Go and shelter. Wait there! Jean! Jean! I'm going up. Paul, stay here. Paul! Fine work, sir. - Well? - Struck by lightning. This is bad. If we wait here, they'll come for us after it's over. They'll find two lumps of ice. We've no time to feel sorry. Move! Will you shut up? Will you shut up? Shut up! 15 m down, take the drop to the foot of the chimney. Then swing to the right to reach the gap. Otherwise... Your singing is driving me mad! Go! Careful! Grab the rope, dammit! Service, 12 %. There. Mum, did Mr Branet have a brandy today? Mum. What, Suzanne? Why fret so, Mum? - He's been gone 36 hours. - The storm is over. - The phone! - No. - It's ringing! - It isn't. Yes, the guides' office. What? Struck by lightning? And the others? Yes. A rescue party. What's it like up there? And the cold? Yes. Thank you. I'll make arrangements. Hi, Brocherel. Pierre! There's been an accident at Les Drus. Only my father was up there. Struck by lightning. The rescue team is on its way up. But it may not reach the summit. Pierre. You think... No, Les Drus are too much for you. I have no choice. It's my father. - I'll join the team. - Pierre. You swore I could do it. Don't contradict yourself. Go to Mother. Stay with her. That's your task now. It's windy out there. It'll be cold on Les Drus tomorrow. Your feet will hamper you. I had to come. I've done some tough climbs since my accident. - Trumpg _ Trump? W8 up to you. You're useless. We needed one more trump. I'm out of them. You're finished. Hello, Pierre. Where did you find out? At the foot of the Périades. Brocherel told me. I saw the ledge where it happened from here. Les Drus... It's 20 minutes from the top. - Off the route? - Yes. They went too far left in the fog. I'm surprised your father went so far up in a storm. It's a devilish position. Not an easy rescue. - It'll be a risky climb. - We go anyway. Us maybe. You'll wait for us here. No, I'm coming. You're out of shape from the city. L'll go anyway. I'm responsible for the team. You'd stop a son from fetching his father's body? Even if it's dangerous? We'll decide in the morning. But I'm in charge here. For now, eat and have some broth. You can't overcome the mountains with fine feelings, frozen feet and hotel manners. Nor with amateurs, right? You don't mean yourself? No. Sorry, Marie, I have to go. My hotel, see. I'll be back first thing tomorrow. Good night. Why wasn't Pierre allowed to follow his vocation? There'd be someone qualified up there. A real son. But there is a real son. Thank you, Georges. You came despite your accident. - You too. - It's different for me. A team breathes together. This warmth is comforting. It's reassuring. It dispels your doubts. Friendship, see. Itoo, in my suffering, I couldn't have it all. Aline... the mountains... Let's sleep. Tomorrow will be tough. Good night, Georges. Good night. It won't be easy. Should we count only on luck to find him? Well, Maxime? If the bad weather returns, it's off. If the storm unhooks him, we'll never find him. We can't wait. We go up. We risk it. But, I'm warning you, it will be tough. The body is way off the normal route. Will we get through? In any case, we can't take on dead weights. Anyone not in top shape needs to stay here. There's no shame in it. It's frank comradeship. I'll answer for Georges. Who'll answer for Pierre? His duty is to go with you. No one can stop him. He's not your responsibility. As for me, I'm getting old. You need agile climbers. I'll wait here. It's wiser to give up than risk my old hide. You're right, Ravanat, that eases my mind. Let's not waste time. Take it slowly and change leader often. And take no risks. Jean Servettaz wouldn't have allowed it. Would Jean Servettaz go further? You're in charge. It's my turn now. Boule. There's not a single hold. The hammer and a piton. No one's ever found this passage. It's too risky and I can't... Even so... - Are you secured? - Yes. Go on. We can get across it. We'll never get across. It's tougher and tougher. Secure me anyway. I wouldn't do that again for a million. My arms have had it. We did all we could. José and Boule nearly fell back there. Your father would never have agreed. I know you did all you could. It's my turn now. Careful, Pierre! It's madness. The hammer and a piton. They're not moving anymore! I've nailed it. Hear that sound, girls? No, mother. Rest now. Sleep a little. That sound... The lumberjacks, perhaps. No, something else. You'll discover it yourselves one clay. With the years, the children, the sorrows, the joys, the same soup, the same sleep... The force of habit. You end up forming one, so to speak. It's good what you did. Without you... Your father would be pleased. Your father is pleased. You have his cross and his heart now. It won't be easy, dear. Marrying a guide and a Servettaz... Ah, women like us... We can't escape our fate. - But you've known happiness. - Yes, a great deal of it. I feel a misgiving on becoming a guide. Father still seemed in charge. In charge...
