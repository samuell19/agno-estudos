How about you? Thanks. I'm OK too. See you later. Can I get my card, Kemal Agabey? - Hi Zeynep. - Hi. Are you ok? You look a little upset. No... You can tell me if you like. I mean... ...if there is something I can help with. There's nothing to talk about. You better go now. As soon as the train comes. You were supposed to change jobs, weren't you? It didn't happen. They're looking for educated people... ...Besides, I don't want to go far away. I'll wait for you tomorrow too anyway. Don't wait for me in the mornings, okay? Why not? Don't wait, that's all. All right, I won't. - Bye then. - Bye. - Welcome. - I came to pick up the lunch box. - Where's its handle? - Its handle? Boss, it was just here. - Boss, I guess it's over there. - Here. Bring some cotton and cologne, will you? Done. Did you see my lighter? No. Aren't you going to have breakfast? No. - Hi, Zeynep. - Are you still here? Yes, I've been waiting for you for an hour. Sorry, I can't come with you. I have things to do. Why not? Today is holiday. What? Do I have to explain everything to you? Yes but we were supposed to go to a movie. Listen, I can't do things you want whenever you want. Understand? - Some other time maybe? - We can't go some other time either. - I can't, do you get it? - I got it. - Well, bye bye. - Okay... See you. Hi Fatma. Well, well. Zeynep. How are you doing? I'm fine. How about you? It's just before the religious feast, you see... ...so there is not much demand for us. You tell me. What do you want me to tell you? You know. Today is my day off. - Are you out shopping? - No, I came to see you. You don't smoke, do you? Don't smoke, by God! Who do you see from the neighbourhood? I don't see anybody... Everybody moved away... It's not like it used to be. That's true. Everybody has moved on and out, right? You were going to rent a flat, what happened? We were. Supposedly we still will... Why? Nothing. Just asked. I've been wondering... ...what you did. We have a lot of ideas, sweetheart. Ayse says we should buy another car instead of... ...renting a house. But I don't know. You look good, Zeynep. I am good. I am. Thank you. I hope it'll go smoothly. Get outa here, motherfucker! Who the hell are you? - Stop your swearing, you heathen! - You're son of a bitch. Stop swearing, you asshole. - Dad, Dad, stand up. - My baby... - Dad, are you okay? Stand up. - My daughter... - Stand up. - Where's that asshole motherfucker? - OK, Dad. Stand up. - All right, my daughter. - Let's go home. - Okay, baby. - Come on, let's go home. - Okay, my daughter, let's go home. - Come on Dad... Dad, walk. - My baby... - Who is it? - It's me... - How are you honey? - I'm fine. Welcome. Thank you. - Does it hurt you a lot? - No, no I'm fine... This is for you... Well, go ahead, open it. - Is there any tea? - Yes. It's OK, I'll get it. - Do you like it? - It's nice. I bought it for you to listen to it while... ...you're working. - Thanks. Well turn it on so that we can listen. It doesn't work. - What's wrong? - I don't know. They didn't put a battery in it. I'll buy one on my way to work tomorrow. - It should have earphones too. - Should it? Yes. Yeah. What's for dinner? I'm going to make some potatoes with mincemeat. - Good... Make some rice, too. - OK, I will. - Let's have some pickles too. - We don't have any. Do you want me to borrow some from the upstairs' neighbours? No, no. - We can make some salad maybe. - OK. How was work today? I didn't work; we were on holiday today. So, what did you do? Nothing. I walked along the shore with some of my friends. We drank tea. We went to the food tent to break the fast. Are you fasting? No, my friends are... so we went there. There was a huge crowd. You shouldn't go to crowded places nowadays. Why not? There's going to be an earthquake. Don't you know? Who said that? Hasan's father-in-law. He works at the seismology center in Kandilli. Don't believe what everybody says. They're all saying something. Anyway, we still should take precautions. Remember Cemal, the guy I used to work with? He got the wining ticket on the horse race. - Really? - Yes. - Did he win a lot of money? - Well, pretty much. Good. At least Esma Auntie will have it a little better. When are you going to win? When pigs begin to fly. Sel?uk, honey, you shouldn't hold on to Funda's clothes. It's not good. I'll send someone over who is in need to take them. Is it OK? Okay. - Hi. - Hi. Ms. M?serref has sent me. There are some clothes you're getting rid of, I guess. Thank you very much. Thanks. - Have a good day. - You, too. - Good morning. - Good morning. Were you here? I came late. I didn't want to wake you up. You are very thoughtful. The air is really stale in here again. You'll get cold. I'm going to make some coffee. Do you want some? Yes... OK... OK. I'll be there in 30-45 minutes. OK, see you. Bye. Funda, what is this letter? I left it for you. I can't keep up with... ...what your comings and goings. For me? Am I supposed to read it? That's up to you, Sel?uk. Tell these things directly to my face, Funda! I wrote it down there. Read it, if it's not much trouble for you. I'll come to pick the rest of my stuff later... ...or not. Is it that easy to leave? I'll leave. That's the only thing you can say isn't that? I hate this apartment, I hate you and this fucking smell, understand? Funda... Will you give me a lift to Sevda's? I'll be leaving in a little while; I have some stuff to do first. Fine, where are the car keys? What are you going to do with the keys? Take a cab, OK? No. I have to get used to driving. I was going to read it. Good bye. Why don't you stay? You can rest a bit. Don't worry about me. I'm sorry Dad. - Hi. - Hi. Ms. M?serref has sent me. There are some clothes you're getting rid of, I guess. Hello 603... OK... All right... The weather is very nice. Do you like rainy weather? I love it too. I like walking in the rain. Me too. Dad... Come in. Iook, this is my room. I hope you'll forgive me. It's a bit messy. Sit down. You can take off your coat if you like. No, I'm cold. Are you hungry? I can get something for you to eat. Don't be afraid. Everything will be OK. We will get through this. If you want we can go to my hometown. Besides, nobody can find us over there. We can live easily. I'll always be next to you. I'll never leave you alone. Don't cry. Give me another glass, will you? Give me some more. Here... Are you okay? I'm fine. How long have I been sleeping? For 2 hours. It's getting dark. Don't be scared. My housemates came. Eat your meal, never mind. Come... Do you need anything? No, thanks. Sleep tight... You too...
