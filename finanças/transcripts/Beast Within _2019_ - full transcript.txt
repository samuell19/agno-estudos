That night started simple enough. It was a launch party for the video game "Werewolves Awaken Online." And I was the lead programmer. The infamous tech mogul Brian Fenris brought me in right out of school and proclaimed me his star protégé. The event was the start of a big marketing push to create some buzz. Brian wanted me to be the poster boy, the face of his company. All the media bigwigs, corporate honchos and celebrities were there. I hated crowds, and I really hated parties. But I did my job, and I showed up. I thought I had everything under control. We were in a very different game that night. We were the game. We were the prey waiting to be slaughtered. Hey, Padre! I got a confession for you. You're dead, August. August? I said you're dead. See? I told you, I'm not the werewolf. Totally unaware of what's really going on. I'm anxious because I'm about to face the media any minute now. Let's get introduced to the players of the game. If August isn't the werewolf, that means... That's Veronica in the red dress. She's Brian's lawyer. Veronica is a God-fearing conservative who has brought her Bible-thumping husband Luke and sister Betty to the party. There's this awkwardness in the way they communicate with one another, but I just stayed out of it. Brian? Brian's the werewolf? No, I'm not. The narrator runs the game, he's never the werewolf. This is my boss, the creator of the game and founder of Supermoon Media. Brian Fenris. He's as intelligent as he is eccentric. The lady that he's with is Nikki. She's Brian's assistant and current fling at the moment. I thought you'd know the rules to the game that your wife has been working on, Luke. Oh, really, Nikki? So you know who the werewolf is, then? It's easy. It's me. And me. And you thought I was the wolf. Well, darling, anybody could be hiding as the werewolf. My husband, or even my sister. Besides, you seemed like you had something to hide. Yeah, I was hiding the fact that I knew who the werewolves were the whole time. You knew it was Betty and Nikki? Oh, no. No, I thought it was you, too. Everything ready? You're on, team. Here we have Remy, our publicist. His job is to ensure that Brian's shenanigans stay out of the headlines. He's banking on my squeaky clean image to deflect the focus around the allegations against Brian. Excellent. So, you get the gist of how to play the game, Natasia? Well, on the night turns, the werewolves choose a player to kill, and on the day turns, everyone, including the werewolves, votes to execute someone trying to kill the werewolf. Natasia the blogger. Brian hired her to do his tell-all story from his perspective, of course. It's another strategy to shift Brian's bad boy image. But that wasn't the only reason he hired Natasia. Paranoid, murderous fun. Of course, it's usually played with a larger group than this, that's why it'll be such a hit online. I just can't believe that August didn't show you the original playing cards for your feature. No, he didn't. Well, you stick with me, and I'll get you some great footage. And a private interview. All right, let's lead with the stars of the spot. Nikki and August... Where are you, man? Let's go, August. - I'll see you later? - You better. All right. Remy, really, is this necessary? Up front, you're the man of the hour. Go, August. - Awesome gameplay, August. - Thanks. - Awesome. - Thanks. I love you, August. Dude, that's great. August, I love the beta. Cool. Smile harder, August. Social engineering takes more than one person. I prefer software engineering, Remy. Yeah, I get that, but I've been branding you up against Brian's dominant personality. Is this... honestly, is this really necessary? Okay, can you get August out on stage? - Yeah, of course. - Show me your teeth. All right, folks... He's not kidding about Brian's personality. And I can speak from experience. God knows, sometimes I just wanna... - Hi, Stan. - Stan? - How'd you know it was me? - Stan?! This is my buddy Stan. Wet met back in college while he was working on his fourth degree. He's the smartest guy you'll ever meet who believes Big Foot exists. Although he's much older, I'm definitely the responsible one. But he cracks me up. And he's the only person I really trust. Now I have to go clean this up. She's a wild one. But seriously, how did you know it was me? Your glee is radiant, Stanley, radiant. Yeah, so is your misery, cupcake. Hey, you wanna see something cool? Where are you reaching to? Original first edition werewolf playing cards. - Do you know how rare these are? - No. - Dude, they're rare. - Okay. Look, you may not know this, but this... this is a party for our game. It's not our game, we just worked on it, remember? Sure, Brian's game then. Well, we're not entirely sure it's Brian's game either. Look, I just pick the winners, all right, August? I don't make excuses for the losers. Well, it's Brian's excuses in front of a jury that has Veronica so worried right now. So you think he stole it too? I don't know. I don't really want to know. I'm just a bit overwhelmed right now. A month ago I'm at work, and none of us even know each other. Yeah, good times, buddy. Then suddenly Brian shows up with buckets of money and brings a bunch of strangers online together through his social engineering. So, what's wrong with that? - You know what I don't get? - What? How he introduced himself. Sends me a Facebook gift. - He sent you a gift? - Yeah. All he did was poke me. You know what poking means. I can't sit down, I can't walk straight. But seriously, who does this? After four weeks we're just gonna launch the game with this? It's a little much, don't you think? Yeah, and on time, too. Last night of the hunter's moon. Brian's not gonna miss a marketing opportunity like that. God damn it, Stan! Yann? What the hell are you doing here? Winning you back. I'm not sure how Yannick even got into this party. But everyone at work had heard about this guy. Brian would lose it on Nikki whenever Yannick was brought up. He's Nikki's ex, and Brian's a jealous man. I'm not some goddamn trophy for you to win, Yannick. If Brian sees you, he'll kill you. Remy, too. Hell, I should kill you myself. Uh... Nikki! Give me one reason why I shouldn't set security on you and have your ass dragged back to France. And make it a good one. I want you back, Nikki. I'm with Brian now. Really? Does Brian know this? We have an understanding. Well, understand that I love you. And I know that you still love me, too. Not the way you speak to me sometimes. I've gotten help, Nikki. Real help. You threatened me, Yannick. But I never did any of those things. Can we just talk? Take off that stupid suit. Wait here. I'll be right back. With the caliber of stunts Brian can pull off, this... this is kind of... shame. Agile development, virtual companies, viral launch parties, that's how business is done today. Welcome to the future. Yeah, but who are all these people? I don't know, look at this douche bag. You got the viral video invite: "An intimate gathering with some of my most intimate friends." He always has that angry look on his face. Leave it to Brian to mix viral and intimate. A surefire recipe for genital crabs meets genital warts on a dark and rainy night of chlamydia. Enough, you're taking it too far. - What, you never had crabs before? - You always take it too far. - Listen... - No, I didn't have crabs. The way he's dragging you around tonight, I wouldn't be surprised if you get some intimate friends of your own tonight. Boom-chaka-boom-chaka boom-chaka... Shut up! You're so loud. Hey, despite your miserable attitude, I think we got a chance with those two hot skanks over there. I love a girl with a hat. - Shh! Shh! She's here. - Wait, you know those muffins? - Dude, introduce me. - No, shut up. Not them. - Is my breath okay? - Not them. Her. Don't look, don't look. You can't be looking. Why can't... You point, what am I supposed to do? - Stop looking. - It's hard not to. You're pointing at her and you're telling me to look over there. Plus, she's hot. How do you know her? She's that girl that follows me online. She's your internet stalker? Shh! How'd she get in here? I invited her. You invited your internet stalker to the party? Well, she's not a stalker. We've been talking online. Dude, that takes balls, man. She's really hot for a stalker. She's not a stalker. Yann? Yann, is that you? Oh, it's you. You scared the shit... You're gonna have to do that again. That's a pretty awesome looking shirt you got going on there. You gotta be kidding me. Yeah, yeah. This job brings out the worst in you, darling. And what, pray tell, is the worst in me? Intemperance. "But put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provisions for the flesh to grant its desires." Romans 13:14. Oh, we're gonna talk about resisting desires? Let's ask Betty to join in our little discussion about sins of the flesh. Shall we? "And let he who is without sin cast the first stone." John 8:7. Are we quoting scripture? Because I don't think that our Lord and Savior would approve of your workplace, Sister. "Be sober-minded, be watchful. You adversary, the Devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour." Peter 5:8. Yeah, it's time for another one, please. Ladies and Gentlemen... Okay, shush. Brian's on. Introducing... the prankster supreme, the technology guru, The CEO of Supermoon Media and all-around lycanthrophile, Mr. Brian Fenris. Thanks, Remy. Remy Lisel, everyone, the man who put "social" in "social engineering." Let's hear it for Remy. I think a lot of you know August, my lead developer and my code-monkey prodigy, who, without him, this game would not be possible. Let's hear it for August. For those of you who don't know me, I am Brian Fenris. Well, today is full circle for me. Or full moon, if you will. I started Supermoon Media by printing "Werewolves Awaken" card games in my garage. But today, thanks to August, and others, I can announce the launch of "Werewolves Awaken Online." 360 interactive on your browsers, your mobiles. Each week you can be one of the villagers trying to survive, or you could be the werewolf, secretly hunting and preying, and eliminating the other players one by one. Ahh! Stan Bachman, everyone. Maybe the only man who knows more about werewolves than I do. Now, I'm sure we all have questions for Mr. Fenris. Would you care to discuss the ongoing litigation over the lack of credit to the original "Werewolves Awaken" co-creator? We're not here to talk about that tonight. Melanie, how can you get any work done when you're always flirting with me? You know, if you lose your job, I can't support you, now that you've migrated from my bedroom to the newsroom. Hi! So... So... - So that's how it's gonna be? - How what's gonna be? I'm finally here... in person. There's no computer screen. And that is how you're gonna say hello to me? Well, I guess you showed how little all that time meant to you. What? Oh, hi. Hi, I'm Stan. I'm friends with August. Hello, Stan. So, Cheyenne, what do you do? Turns out she's a cam girl, I just found out. - A what? - She... I take my clothes off on the internet for money. Lots of money. And I'm not ashamed of it. - Why were you hiding it from me? - I wasn't hiding anything from you. So you just forgot to mention what you do for months and months on end? Wait a minute! Are you Sololady23? I am. Toehugger1337. What? - Yeah! - No way. I didn't recognize you with your clothes on. You gotta be kidding me. That's okay. And do you know why it's okay? Because I look amazing naked. Dude, she looks so awesome naked. Yeah, see? It's nothing to be ashamed of. I don't think it's bad, I just... I just... this is just all really weird right now. Abomination! You've brought an abomination on us all! This land was ours before you arrived. Our honored dead claimed the land in blood. It's they you insult, desecrate with this abomination. Not again. How'd he get in here? I don't know. Uh, Father... Don't you "Father" me, young pup. You helped bring this upon us all. But, Father, surely my generous weekly donations to the church... Cannot buy back your soul for being part of this den of sinners. This sin, or any other, the Lord shall flay thy wolfish visage. You have truly marked yourself for the Beast. Well, the game keeps coming alive all night long. The priest character is part of the exclusive expansion pack that will be a gift to all my special guests tonight. Get Argus working on patch to add that skin as soon as possible. All right, how about some drinks? How about some champagne? Weak stunt. That dude is terrible casting for a priest. Okay, I'm gonna check on this PR guy. Stan, can you show her around? Yeah, Toehugger, that makes sense. Well, you know, if you got big toes. If you got big toes... - So this is where August works? - And me. Brian has us both sequestered here under his watchful eye. - So, Brian's pretty controlling, you know? - I've heard. And what I'm about to show you, only he, August, and I have ever seen. Whatever you do, you can't tell Brian, because if he finds out, he'll kill me. Okay. the panic room! So, you're saying these are all real? Real silver, every one. Just like the silver bullet around my neck. Now, if a real werewolf ever attacked me, he better watch out. As you can see tonight, I'm all about genuinely immersive games. There's nothing I love more than being inside a visceral experience. Really? Really. Hey. Hey, August. I thought I'd check in after that whole mess. Everything okay? Yeah, Father's just always like that, fire and brimstone. Father, as in, the priest. Right. That dude was pretty intense, man. Yeah, no worries. You're coming to the post-party game? Uh, actually I was gonna... That was a statement, not a question. You're coming. Bring your date. My date? Yeah, the hot babe that Stan's dragging around. No, no, no, she's not my date. Like Stan could ever get a girl like that. Anyways, it's good geek chic sex appeal for Natasia's feature. Hey, you're August, right? - Yeah. - Yeah, you created the game. Well, Brian did, so. Oh, the old guy, yeah, he looks like my dad. He said you created it. No, well, I did the interactive game. He did the original game, so. Oh, so he's the money guy. You know, I have a lot of really great ideas for games. We could do one. That's more of a Brian thing. But you could introduce me, right? I... I guess I could, I mean. You know, it's a lot of hard work, coding. A game engine's based on a framework that encompasses a library of modules that configure and manage gooeys... Gooey? What's a gooey? Uh, it's not important. It's fine. You're funny. You know, I have a lot of really great ideas for games. You should introduce me to your boss. Uh... Tell you what. I want you to see my gooey. Um... I... I gotta go. I-I should... I should really go. Yeah. What? Well, I'm just kind of with somebody, you know, so we have a thing... Okay... Cheyenne, you're the... you're the best. You're the best. You're the most beautiful, smart, incredible, amazing girl I've ever met, and... Ugh! That's horrible. That's shit. Come on. Hello? I-I wanted us to be honest with each other. You know? Like, do your parents even know? Are they concerned? That's horrible. Hey, what's going on back there? Okay... I know you, okay? And if we're together, you don't have to feel like you need to do this type of stuff. Stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Okay. I'm sorry. Cheyenne, I'm sorry. Are you taking a number 2? Ahh! ♪ NO SERVICE TUESDAY, OCTOBER 27 ♪ Damn it! It won't work, Melanie. I'm, uh, jamming all reception. No livestreaming for you. And the exclusive is promised elsewhere. And I bet I know to whom. - Now, Melanie. - Save it. I know how you work. I did not appreciate that question earlier. Get your hands off me. You can control the world around you, but you can't control me. Or what I know. Hey, babe. There you are. Uh, yeah. Brian, may I introduce Richard, my trainer. Boyfriend. I'm her boyfriend. Ah. Nice to meet you, Brian. "Bri." Richard. Dick. Melanie and I were just discussing an exclusive. Team members are holding a private after party, playing the game we all love so much. I can guarantee you one-on-one time with each and every one of them. You can even bring along your, uh... Dick. Well... that is great. Um, fine. Hugs! This isn't over. Have a safe drive. Take care, man. Yeah, yeah, thank you. Appreciate the love, man. Take care. Thank you. If the have-nots ever want to tear down Brian's empire, he can hole up here for months. He's got bed, food, a urine filtration system that turns your piss into drinkable water, kind of like a flat champagne. - Really? - Not that I tried it or anything, but yeah. - Does he have any guns? - No, Brian's not into guns. Too random for him. But this? This really represents Brian. The latest info, the latest trends, it's all in the application. Watch. ♪ GARAGE ♪ On top of the world and in complete control. Gonna go see the hot tub. What...? What are you doing? Don't... Don't... Get... Oh! You can't do that! - Ha! - Melanie! Oh, my God. Hey. How did you get in here? Secret back door. Yeah, Brian's a real-life Bond villain. Yeah, actually the launch, it's winding down in there, so we're supposed to go to this after party and do a few more rounds for the news piece, so I was thinking maybe you should head in soon. For sure. So, maybe you can... head in? Oh, yeah. Oh, of course. - See you guys in there. - Yeah. - Nice guy. - Yeah. Um, listen, I'm... I'm sorry about before. I'm just not so sure about people anymore. Yes, you mentioned that. And I don't think what you do is bad. Well, I didn't think that you would. I mean, you dated a stripper. Um... a stripper? Remember when you told me that you dated a stripper? Oh, yeah. That. - I made that up. - You made it up? - Yeah. - I mean... you make this big stink about how I make a living, and then just go making up stuff? I was trying to impress you. - Oh. - Let's just... Can we just drop it? Okay. The sooner we can get out of here, then we can just talk. Really... really talk. But just for the record, I was completely aware that you were lying about the stripper thing. It was very ridiculous. - Mm. - Okay. Cool. Shouldn't we see what those screams were about? Nah, that's just how Brian runs his games. Bastard always has to take it to the next level. He just doesn't know how to relax. Are you nearly done? Just one more thing. What are you doing? Causing some real damage. Now for the fuel line. Hey! Ah. Melanie's question, Father Roman's outburst... I don't feel confident. Do you feel confident? Is Nikki back? God! That's Nikki? - Oh, my God. No. - Sweet Jesus. Go on! Go! All right, everyone, let's get inside right now. Hey, buddy... Who are you, man? Let's go. In the house, now. Okay, just calm down. Brian? What the hell, man? I know this piece of shit! I'd know Yannick anywhere! - Yannick? - Shut up, you goddamn murderer! - I didn't do it! - You abusive piece of shit! I loved her! Like hell! You fucking killed her! Everyone is inside asking questions. - It's him. - Is that Yannick? What does it look like? Stop, we don't even know what happened here. Let's get him up and call the cops. And no one touch anything until the cops get here. Stan, get him up. Come on, you don't need to be here. Come on. - Hey, what's going on? - What is going on? Who is this? Did he do that to Nikki? That's Yannick, Nikki's ex. He said he found her a few seconds before we did. Okay, look, everyone, obviously something terrible has happened. WE don't know exactly what it is, but... We're calling the cops and we're gonna wait here until they come. They're not coming. I can't reach them, the line's dead. What? Okay, I'm going out to the junket box. August, I want you to keep everybody here. Nobody leaves! Remy, come with. Wait. Wait, where's Melanie? Melanie and her guy? They were walking out the front door before the screams. Where did they go? Two murders, Melanie in shock. The phone's out, and we're down to one car. So we're gonna play this smart. I'm gonna hold the fort, you're gonna go for help. What are you gonna do about Yannick? Now don't worry, he's not the killer. I know that. He was with us the whole time. But I wanna see him sweat a bit. So, I've got the emergency flares from the panic room. I want you to take Stan and your girl and get out of here. I can't believe this shit. We're gonna go to the top of the hill, we're gonna try and reach a signal with the cell phones, we're gonna call the cops, you guys just stay inside. Okay? This shit's fucked! Guys, I'm really worried about everyone back at the house because this is the video game coming to life. I don't know who it is, but it's got to be someone connected to the game. So, I'm pretty sure it's a werewolf. Stan. I'm sorry, but come on. Full moon, we're cut off. And did you see those bodies? They were shredded. Is anyone getting a signal? - Eyes on the road! - What the hell is that? She has a gun! Yeah, I have a gun. I own guns, I like to shoot guns. It relaxes me. Does it have silver bullets? Can you hear yourself? Who have I been talking to this whole time? Look out! Oh, God. Okay, just calm down, everybody. Calm down. But the lights are out! I can see that the lights are out, Veronica. Where's your generator, Brian? In the shed. Now just relax, all right? You can't mean to have us go out there with a killer on the loose. Or leave us in here with one. Relax! Remy, keep everyone here. I'm gonna go out to start the generator. And you're coming with me. - What... - Come on, Yannick. Come on! Cheyenne? Cheyenne! Cheyenne? Hey! Are you okay? Yeah? Come here. Holy... Oh-oh-oh! What's... - Oh, man. - Oh, my God. I don't know what that was, but we're not far from the house, so let's get going. It just ripped her whole spine out, man. - Shut up, Stan. - That is not a human thing to do. - Stan, shut up. - There's no way we're dealing with a regular human here. Will you listen to yourself? Is this guy an ordinary killer? He's not an ordinary guy. He's a psycho killer. But, August, what about that thing you crashed your car trying to avoid? - Large, furry... - Deer. Goat. Werewolf. Calm down. - Calm down. You're okay. - I'm okay? - You're okay. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Guys. This is Yannick's shirt. We gotta get back now. Shut it down now! August! Remy! - Damn. You really know how to use that gun. - Yes, I do. She's got a gun? She's got 12. So, did you guys bring back help? We didn't get far before the crash. Melanie, she's dead. - From the crash? - From the werewolf. There is no werewolf. Wait, what? Melanie's dead, but not from the accident. She was murdered. What the hell happened in here? I mean, we were attacked. - By the werewolf? - Veronica: By the devil! Brian took Yannick with him to go and start up the generator while the rest of us waited. Our flare was dying. Remy was about to start another one when... that's when it struck. We could hear it come in. It knocked out Remy. My brave Luke tried but failed, and it made its way to my sister. And I always look after my little sister. I have seen sin. So much. And my sin... my sin has been suppressing it. Keeping it all quiet. Brian's thievery. My sister and my husband's infidelity. And no one is blinder then she who will not see. And so God saw fit to take my eyes from me so that I might see more clearly. But he did grant me one more mercy. The light that chased away the evil also showed me its face. Father Roman spoke the truth. We are cursed for what we've done. God showed me the truth. Remy, what did you see? I don't know. I was out of it. I don't know what I saw. Luke? - It was a demon. - Luke, seriously? If Veronica says it was a demon, it was a demon. Don't any of you guys get it? There's a monster here, all right, but it's only a man. - Yannick. - No, it's not Yannick. Think about it. Who's still missing? You don't... - Brian? - He's finally lost it. - It's gotta be Brian. - But Brian... I mean, it does make sense. You all know he's crazy. But not that kind of crazy. - No, this is absurd. - Remy, think through it. Who's been killed so far? Brian's ex-girlfriends... Melanie and Nikki. And both the guys they had on the side. - Yeah, but how? - Simple. He starts off with Nikki. Sets up the body. Then he comes in like he hasn't seen her. Is Nikki back? Leaving Yannick to find the body and cause all the suspicion. Then when he goes to check the phone lines, he takes care of Richard. And we were away for like an hour. He had plenty of time to leave with Yannick, take care of him, finish off Melanie, then try for you guys. - But what about what Veronica saw? - The devil. Yeah, Stan, where's your costume? - Costume? - That stupid werewolf costume you were scaring everyone with. - The utility shed. - The utility shed, where Brian went with Yannick. - It's so obvious. - I don't know, August. - Why would he do this? - Because he's a short-tempered, werewolf-obsessed, control-freak psychopath, Remy. Come on, Remy. It makes sense. But not with what we know about him. We've known him for like a month, tops. Maybe... maybe Brian is a werewolf. Brian's an insane killer and we've got one gun. We've got these. It's not a goddamn werewolf. Silver's not gonna help. Dude, werewolf or not, you stick the pointy end of one of these into somebody, you win. Grab everything. Stay. Turn around, Brian. It's over. Step aside, or I swear... Shut up and lose the stupid costume, psycho! - Where's Remy? - He saw something in the woods and ran off. Guys, uh, guys. No, no, no, no! I want you to know that Luke and I were so... so sorry. - I got 'em! - Beatrice. - Yes? - The curse approaches. You son of a bitch. You maniac. I got him! Damn it, August. I knew it had to be him. It's Yannick. Remy, damn it. What are you doing? He can't possibly be the killer. There's no way. - Why the hell not, August? - He has no motive. Motive?! This monster has been abusing Nikki for the past three years. Christ! You'r genious Brian theory was hanging by a thread and you dragged us out in the goddamn darkness for it. - What? Where's Brian? - He's dead. Cheyenne and I found him dead. - But that doesn't mean Yannick... - Yes, actually, I think it does mean Yannick. - Bring me that chair. - No, no. Remy, listen. Listen to me. We found these cards on all the bodies. What does that tell you? - That Yannick is a crazy psycho. - No. It has to be someone who knows the game as well as you. Or you. Or you, Stan. - Stan, you're hearing me, right? - I don't know, August. I mean, we found him naked in the woods covered in blood. Classic werewolf M.O. Bela Lugosi, 1941. December 12th to be exact. Even a man who's pure of heart who says his prayers at night... Remy... what are you doing? What we should've done a long time ago when we found this little monster. Remy, you don't plan on killing him in cold blood? No, I don't. But Veronica will. I am the instrument of God. He is my eyes. And I am His hand. Jesus, Remy. What the hell, man? This is sick! By Your will, oh, Lord, I shall cleanse us of this curse. Guide my hand and restore us unto Your grace. Nobody goddamn well moves, you hear me? - Cheyenne... - No, August. - Cheyenne. - I said no, August! Hey, I don't know you. Not really. You know me like I know you. I do know you. I know your dad's favorite advice to give is, "You die now, or you die later." And if we stick together, no one else is gonna die, Cheyenne. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be fine. Murderer! - Betty! - Stan: No! Oh no. Oh no. Betty... Betty. No. Please. No one else is gonna use it. Just lay it down on the ground. Mm. Imported. Smart man. Smart but... not smart enough. You monkeys never are. I mean, you build all this... the cottages, electricity, the Internets. You light up the darkness. And now we talk about the social media. Bringing the world together. How many friends do you have? Who's following who? But all you've really done is digitize the most basic function of any successful species... the tribe. But you forgot the most basic function. To keep the wolves out. Why? Why are you doing this? The only reason... the hunt. I mean, sure, the hunger drives it, but really the hunt is its own delicious reason. The chase. The herding. The playing. That's why. - How long you been planning this, you sick bastard? - Plan? No, no, no, August, no. There's no fun in planning. But why here? Why now? I know what you want. A reason. An explanation. But... I have already given you the only reason that has ever mattered between species. Predator... and prey. The rest is just natural course. So what now? You gonna kill us? Have you been listening at all?! The hunt is on. And for the sport of it, I am going to give you a head start. So... run! Whoa. Betty! Betty! Come on, come on. Come on. Hurry! Come on! Come on! I love you. Come on, you son of a bitch. No! No. Oh, no. No. No. No, no. Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. It's a werewolf. - So what do we do? - Stan: What? What do we do now? How do we stop it? - How the hell should I know? - You're the goddamn werewolf expert. - It's... - You always know everything! - You always know everything! - How the hell should I know what to do? Huh?! Tell me! What are we supposed to do? - What the hell do you want me to do? - Hey! Hey! August, stop it! Stop it! I just really need your help right now because I don't think I'm as prepared as you are to accept this. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, bro. - Sorry. Seriously, I think we're safe in here. - Oh, he's in the shed. - Maybe we can use something to shore it up. The shelves. Oh, yes, excellent, because a few assemble-it-at-home tables and shelves are gonna be able to stop a monster that can smash through a fucking steel door. Well, it'll slow 'em down so we can get to the... Feel better? I know I do. Oh, you don't know how good this feels. The hunger... My hunger is gone. First time in 200 years. The hunger is gone. My turn is over. But the hunt is eternal. Father taught us that. Forever and ever, a hunt without end. The predator's predator. Father is still hungry. Stan: August, what was he talking about? It doesn't matter. - No, we're missing something. - He was messing with us. He loved this whole twisted rampage the whole way through. No, there's something more to what he said. We're missing... You... Oh, it's you. Me. Oh, Remy. He so liked playing with his food. And I love all my children. No matter how childish they may be. You were so young. What was the point of killing my best friend? Killing all those innocent people? For what? For some high? I'm afraid I'm too old and too wise to play the games of my young pups. Oh, well, in that case... Come on. Go, go, go! Here we go again. How long did Stan say that that door is gonna last? Not long enough. Do we have any silver left? Lost it all. Except... What are you doing? Brian's silver bullet. He always wore it. Where's your gun? It's by the car outside. Here's the plan... I'm gonna use that back door... gonna grab the gun, you're gonna load this bullet, you're gonna shoot him in the heart. August... August, this is crazy. How do you even know that this is gonna work? You can do this. You die now, or you die later. Hey, Padre! I got a confession for you! August... August, come on. August... I love all of my children. Cheyenne... Cheyenne. Cheyenne. You did it. You did it. Die now... or die later. No. No, not now. Not now, Cheyenne. Not now. Not now, Cheyenne. Stay with me. My wounds had completely healed by the morning and fur started to grow. I hadn't learned how to control it yet. Roman's bite had passed on the disease. That night consumes me. It's my obsession. I have it in me. Now, I'm the monster.
