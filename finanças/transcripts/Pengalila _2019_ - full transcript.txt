Scene from the film "Ormakalundayirikkanam" (1995) No caste, no relegion, no Justice for you... No Church, no Temple, no God for you... This procession is to dismiss the government Why dismiss? Because it is the government of the poor Of the poor?Ours then? Of course But I didn’t know that.. You will get to know soon.. We will be given land.. They’ll give us land?

Amma read it and I listened Now it is when you say such things That we are able to learn about them.. So I’ve become a song book for you? Not song book, but text book.. Yes.. Sometimes I feel it is good That I didn’t have a native place So many different lands, different people.. All lands are like one’s own Yet not one’s own.. That too is a good thing! But not even an inch of land of one’s own! I stayed in many places But I was never lazy, I worked Joined the people to fight for rights Rehabilitate the displaced! Justice from Government!

In Ardh Satya and Aakrosh.. All the frauds are here! They are my friends now.. Now? Get lost, you.. Ompuri’s acting in Ardh Satya was good But in Aakrosh.. What a character! And that wail at the end! A performance that blended actor and character! True! Aakrosh is a great film! What about a song? That’s why Abubacker is here Come on Abubacker.. We’re in good mood Which song? Your favourite! Yes, that will do.. The one who roamed around Aluva riverbed Holding the tail of the wind Didn’t the torrential rain, Carry you in its currents, And take you to Kochi backwaters? Oh,the dark spotted koel That came to bathe in Kurumali river Great song! The song is good It is our Azhakan.. The one who cried holding the feet of the rising waves of the backwaters Didn’t anyone come with a boat To row and row you away? I will put an end to his singing! Why are you silent? If he sings, what is your problem? When decent people come here, He starts his bloody song! But they all listened to it! That’s their decency! What decency? They liked the song, so they listened You didn’t like the song Because you don’t like him! They liked the song, and I didn’t Because I don’t like him Why don’t you go and teach? This place is becoming problematic First I thought it’ll be a relief from Bombay’s rush But here, I’ve nothing to do Because it is vacation time they are with me After that, I have nothing to do.. I’m boring you with my worries... Sorry! I have a doubt.. Yes? What we call the meaning of life and all It varies according to what we feel.. If we don’t feel it, There is no meaning, isn’t it?

Snow, on the fragile nerves of the leaves Snow, on the peaks of the hill Snow, melting highland ancestors Snow where firehill grandmas smoulder Snow on the head of God’s snake Snow in the attic where goddess resides In the verdant green of the grass shoots Snow drawing water marks Snow, that covers the fire-face of Sun God And revels sucking blood Snow that draws the narrow bridge Over which people, holding hands, pass without falling Snow that turns drinking water to stone Snow that upturns settlements Snow that roams around as white bear Snow that swallows  lightning Coming from the South with the smell of death Snow that dances in the veranda Descending from the palm tree with the smell of the flower Snow that catches the earth in its fangs Snow that guzzles songs through the river Snow that sheds from the feathers of the vulture Lo, a pulaya sings the song of the burial ground With his drunken tongue, sitting in the cold.. Hey.. Don’t you ever set foot in my compound! Hey.. Come.. Koshy Sir?! Why did you beat uncle? Don’t you open your mouth! It is all because of you! You shouldn’t have beaten him.. When decent people come home He comes drunk and sings in front of my house..! All those decent people are lying there dead drunk! Don’t talk nonsense! They’re my friends, I can own upto them But who is he to you? Shame on you ! Radha dear, have breakfast.. Me and mom were really sad - When my dad hit uncle..

You know why we’re boozing here? To sing sitting here.. From now on, that scoundrel won’t sing.. He is fasting to death He will be arrested before that and he won’t come out So, from now on, his songs are ‘cut’ I am celebrating that! Some people may not like it They can leave.. Such an uncouth man! Hey, stop there! You can’t bear it, eh? You want to listen to his song? Do one thing.. Put us all in jail.. Then you can bring his song home, eh? To the bed room.. - Sir You still have this house The house is gone This is no more a house How can it be? The company is still paying the rent And you are still the company’s staff!
