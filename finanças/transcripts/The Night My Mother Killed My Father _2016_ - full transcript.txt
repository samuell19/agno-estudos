TO MY FATHER, THE PHILOSOPHER CARLOS PAR√çS Auguste, my love! They've taken my hands! They don't want me to make more mud children for you! Jump! - What? - Jump, jump! Go on! - What do you mean "jump"? - Jump. Do the lines jumping. - All of it? - All of it. Go! Jump! - Like this? - The lines. - My hands! - More. - Where did you hide them? - More! Frolic about! Alright... Auguste! - Go! Leap about! - My love! - My love! - More. They don't want me to make more mud children for you! Put the bag in there. Miss! Please, I'm begging you. My wife's not here. - Isn't that her? - That'd be great... No, she's my ex-wife, Alba's mother. The mother of the little one isn't here, my current wife. She's bringing Dylan, his son, but not my biological brother. It's a mess, but we're not a commune, we're just divorced with kids from each marriage... I don't care about your mess. We're half an hour late and I don't want to arrive at night. Up you go. Don't get left behind. - Honey, say goodbye to Dad. - No, Mum's got my dolly. Up! And the skis and boots? My wife's bringing them, she's almost here. Don't start that again. You can't come without gear, we said it over and over in the circulars. Screw your circulars, you witch. - What do we do? - I don't know, I can't think. How can my wife be such a disaster? - Leap, leap! Lines! - They took my hands! - They don't want me to...! - Up! Up! Break up the lines! A leg is what I'll break! We've been at it for two hours! I've got an appointment. Can we do this later? What? Can we... stop for... 10 minutes? I'll call and then... I'll jump, I'll do what you like. Forget it. Thanks for coming, but I don't see you in it. You don't see me... - What do you mean? - The character, Camille Claudel, is 25. How old are you? The same as two hours ago, when we started rehearsal. No, that's fantastic, terrific news. - Susana! - What? - Sorry, I can barely hear you. - Susana, I remind you that we normal human beings have a problem! Snap out of it! Isabel and her loony son aren't here! The girls are boarding and there are no skis. - I'm talking to Argentina. - And I'm talking to you. Dad, they're taking Estrella away! Dad! Dad! Stop, stop, stop! Stop! Stop! Open up. Estrella! Estella, honey. I'm going to sue you! Oh, God. Where is it? Here it is. Don't hang up. Shit! - One, two, three... - Great! Don't step on the lines. Good. Pick up the rock. Mum! Sweetie! - Here I am! - My dolly! Yay! Where the hell were you? - Don't tell me they've gone! - Why didn't you answer? Where's the bus? What a fucker! Son, watch your language. It's a motherfucker, it is. Very badly organized, Isabel. It's my fault, a friend lent me the gear, so we had to go get it. It's my fault, I had to pick you up. No! I left my bag and History book on the bus, and I've got a test! "My History book and I've got a test!" He thinks it's funny. We've lost a ton of money because it was pre-paid, and you think it's funny, right? Let's all have a laugh. Let's not get frantic. Let the boy follow the bus in the car. - Has he got a license? - Yeah, I got it last month. Yes, an experienced driver. Even better, I taught him myself. I don't know, it scares me. It's a long way. Mum! The car practically drives itself. It's my car, I'm not lending it. - Dad! - I want to go skiing! I don't think it's a bad idea. Okay- - Dylan, not over 90. - I know. You hear? Listen to me. Look at me. Alright? - Okay. - Okay. Give Dad a kiss. Thanks, everyone, for listening to me. Go on. I hope it's not the last time we see our children. That'll do. See you soon, guys! How's Dylan doing at school? - Terrible. - Great. - He passed Ethics. - Well, he only passed Ethics. Isn't that the main thing, to distinguish good from evil? You joke about everything. It's no system for bringing up kids. Oh, there's a system? How's the movie coming, Susana? It all depends on if we find a male lead and co-producer, which are in the same bag. - So we know nothing. - Yes, we do. We're meeting a possible partner for dinner tomorrow. - That's great! - Tomorrow? Don't tell me who it is. Malkovich? No. Benicio del Toro? George Clooney? Peretti. Peretti! Who's Peretti? You've got no idea! He's a wonderful Argentinean actor. Argentinean? I thought we agreed we wanted an American. American. North American! North America, South America... Who cares? Even better, we can shoot it in Spanish. - He's perfect for the role. - I can't put a face to that name. Hey, take him to the bar. First one's on the house. Stop, I'm getting out here. See you soon, babe. 'Bye, everyone Good luck with the dinner. - See you. - Angel... Chill out. It's Peretti! How could you marry that goofball? Save your arguments for home. What arguments? We never argue, do we, honey? Door to door service. Girl, when I see your house, I see why my husband left me. So do I, sometimes. Like a drink? Cut out the invitations. See you tomorrow, tell me where. Why don't we have the dinner at home? No way. No way. Let's go to good restaurant. It's not a bad idea. There's no privacy in public and we have a tight budget. - I'd love to do it. - Because you love stardom. I can see you making eyes at... What's his name? Peretti! Let her make eyes! The movie depends on it. Angel, if he comments on the script, don't get frantic, I know you. He's going to comment on my script? An actor? Tomorrow, at 9. At 9. Let's have dinner and go to bed. I just realized, I had no time to go shopping. Or get to the bus on time, or fix the downstairs bathroom... I remind you, it's still blocked. The plumber swore he'd come tomorrow. If it's not fixed when the guests arrive, we'd had it. It's nuts having the dinner here. - I don't know why you said it. - Stop complaining. Tell me about the movie. How's the casting going? The main character is great. No need for an American actress now. I don't want to talk about it. It's enough to have to depend on the opinion of an actor. - It's the limit! - But he'll love it! Your movie's got everything: love, sex, murders... What matters is the treatment of violence, Isabel, my thoughts on the human condition. I should've stay a novelist, film people trivialize everything. Your movie will be perfect. I hope you give me a role this time. Don't start! I hate it when you go "actress" on me! - I am an actress. - Not here. - Here you're my wife. - You work with your ex. - Would you rather be my ex? - I don't know! So, would you consider me? What's wrong, cutie? You're going to kick up a fuss about a movie - we may not even make? - Don't come near me. Don't touch me. I said: don't touch me. Honey. Yes. Yes, I know. Pick me up? I'm already at the house. No, my flight arrived at 7, not 9. What do you want me to do? Go back to Buenos Aires? Make time go backwards? I'm not in a bad mood. They got my arrival wrong, I've lost my bag. And this house is in the sticks. Apart from that, it's all great. I'll call you later. Ciao. Isabel! Fuck... Hello. Oh, a sight for sore eyes! Come in. Please. It's great to see you. I haven't been so anxious to see someone in ages. Come in. Thanks. Thanks a lot. You said you'd come yesterday, then tomorrow, then in the evening... This turd's been waiting two days for you. Smells like shit! You can't fix it from over there. Is the plumber here? Diego! Diego? Diego, yes. Diego Peretti. And I know nothing about toilets. What a start! Poor Angel, you must think he's nuts. No, just a neurotic obsessive. Nothing therapy won't cure. "Therapy"! Oh, God, don't say that word. He hates anything to do with psychologists, coaches and such. - I'm an actor and a psychiatrist. - Then let's change the subject. Is that you? An actress? That's worse than a psychiatrist. - Yes. - What are you doing now? Auditions. Auditions, auditions and more auditions. I just turned 40 and it's like I've got Tutankhamen's curse. You're not the problem, it's the mummies you annoyed. - Yes. - Speaking of mummies... While I was making canapes, I thought, as revenge for being coarse and not recognizing you, you might dump me, the script and the project, so tell me now so we can dine in peace. Honey, here. Have a whisky and let's relax, okay? Let's sit down. Diego, Angel, come on. Diego, sit down. Thanks a lot. There's Susana. Hallelujah! She's his ex, and the only one who can control him. I'll go. So you're a writer. Yes. Crime novels? And the story of this film, did you base it on real life'? - They didn't tell you? - About what? I was in prison for several years. For murder. I took revenge on someone who destroyed my parents' lives. - Really? - No. But I aroused your interest and you believed it. That's this movie, a lie well told. A lie? Diego! - Susana. - At last! Sorry about the airport mix-up. No! It's nice to meet you in person. Same here. Thank you so much for coming. This is so important for us. Angel put so much of himself into the script. This will be a film with soul, heart and truth. Angel was just telling me precisely that, right? She's my ex and still puts me on a pedestal. - Shall we have dinner? - Yes. - Let's go in. - Alright. - What did I miss? - Nothing, they're getting on fine. - It's delicious, you'll see. - That's fine, thanks. Do you always work in the family? They do. They don't use me. Because the opportunity hasn't arisen, lsabelita. And yes, all of my films are co-written with Angel. Yes. By co-written she means: "I don't like this" or "Put in more action". I also sometimes remind you it's a film, not a novel. He'd make it all dialogue. I love films full of dialogue. I'm a big fan of "On Probation", "it's Not You, It's Me"... I'm a fan of everything you do. "Wakolda"...! Thank you. I have a question you must've been asked tons of times... Do you prefer comedy or drama? It's the classic question. My question is: What did you think of the script? Excuse me. Go ahead, ask me. Do you think... it's good for actors to go to therapy? I'll get it... the door, I mean. I'll get therapy for later. I don't know, in Argentina everyone goes to therapy, not just actors. It's weird not to go. My son goes to therapy. Don't let Angel find out. I don't care, he's not his father. - You have no children in common? - Yes. Estrella. - We adopted her two years ago. - She's Chinese. Then there's Alba, Susana and Angel's daughter. And Dylan, who's my son and my ex's. Now they're skiing all together. It's incredible how well you all get along, it's exemplary. Honey, your ex, he needs to talk to you urgently. Well! Speak of the devil... Excuse me a moment. Get rid of him, and fast. Weird, isn't it? - Wine? - No. I don't drink, thanks. - A teetotaller? - Yes. I can't stand the lack of control. I'll have some. Sometimes to be in control, you need to drink a little. Yes. Or a lot. Or a lot. How are you? We're having dinner. Alex, Isabel. - How are you? - Hello. - Can I get a glass of water? - Yes, of course. Alex... I'll Wait. Hey, isn't she a little... well, way too young? We're suggesting that you not only star - but co-produce as well. - What we're not suggesting... A glass of water. My ex. We're not suggesting that you rewrite it. No... In case you'd thought about it. All that power... Ignore him. If we need to do some alterations... The script isn't a suit! Have you read it? No! You're... You're... You're... I can't remember... Yes, the big nose guy. - Cyrano. - Who? No, somebody famous. You crack me up! The Argentinean actor. Darin. Ricardo Darin. No, I wish. Who are you? Alex, Carlos' girlfriend. Isabel's ex, this man's wife. Hello, Alex. How are you? This is wicked, It's on the tip of my tongue. - The other famous Argentinean. - Messi. Maradona. Mafalda. Diego Peretti, girl. Excuse me, dear, what did you want? - The bathroom. - The downstairs one is broken. Never mind, I suddenly don't need to pee. - Excuse me, we're having dinner. - Can we do a selfie? Yes, of course. Just a minute, eh? My girl friends are gonna freak when they see it! - Pucker up. - What's that? Pucker up, like this. - Both of us. - Yes, puckering up. Now wink. - Poke your tongue out. - My tongue? Fine. I'm sorry, it was my idea. It was my fault, but I'll... It was my fault, but... What's wrong? - The girls. - No, the kids are fine. Your mother? - Yours? - No, that's not it. - Everything's fine. - Excuse me, we've got a guest and your friend is sitting on his knees. I understand, I'm going... Well, we're going. I just wanted to explain it to you. Okay- I need it. I'll make you a copy. I'll see you out. Corning? - I'll just get the roast beef out. - Okay. I'm Peeing myself! - They're having fun. - Yes. Take her away. Carlos, this is Diego Peretti, a really famous actor. - Hi. - Hi, how are you? - Alex, let's go. - Hold on. Diego's incredible. Check out what he says. Say what you said before. Butt...? In this photo we look like a couple of buttheads. "Buttheads"! I love the accent he puts on. He's not putting it on, he's Argentinean, so he has the accent. Hilarious! You're very attractive. - Thanks a lot. - Really. Humour gets me so hot. - Take her or I'll kick her out. - I'll take her. Alex, honey, really... That smells nice! It looks great! I'm so hungry... Come on, we're being a nuisance. - Really? - Yes. But we're having so much fun. - Sure, but these people... - It looks delicious! Can I try a little? - She's a hungry girl! - Yes. - We'll get more cutlery. - Are you sure? I've got no problem. Great! Angel, come with me. Potato salad. - Shift up, Diego? - Yeah, sure. Right, Diego. I'm Carlos. Diego... Peretti. Bufihead! So, Diego, a joint? Why did you say they could stay? And where'd that ditz come from? I don't know, Angel. She's Carlos' girlfriend. They're ruining everything! What's wrong? What's wrong? - You wouldn't believe... - Hey, relax. Relax, no. I hate him. I hate him! Okay, it's alright, it's fine. I hate him! I could kill him! What did he do to you? I can't, I can't, I can't. Do that thing you do... - Like what? - I don't know. That thing... Honey, have some water. I can't... Yes, okay. Okay, it's over, it's over. What do you get when you cross a weed and a dope? A weed and a dope? I'm giving you a clue. I don't know. - Waccy baccy! - That's my girl! 100% organic weed, I grow it myself. Like some? No smoking in my house. After dinner you can smoke all you like in the garden. Whatever the boss says. Diego, are you going to work on their film? We hope so. Cool! What's the movie about? It's from a novel by Angel. It's wonderful. It's about murders committed by a woman. So the star's a gal? And a policeman's after her, that'd be Diego. - Who's playing the girl? - It's undecided. We want your opinion, Diego. How do you see her, Angel? A brunette, exotic, a dark expression that makes you think she could kill. Naturally she has to be a good actress, pretty, young... - With a name. - Not over 30. So young? She has to be attractive. But 30 is ancient! Cool, I love all this. - A toast to the movie? - No. Not until it's signed, it could bring back luck. Then let's toast to something else. - Shall we tell them? - No, Alex. Not now. Why not? Yes! It's not the time. And we can invite Diego, I really fucking like him. - I really fucking like you. - Same here. I wasn't going to announce it yet, but... - We're getting married. - Yeah! And you're... all invited, though you'll have to get a plane. Yes, because we're also... going to live in Brazil! You're full of surprises. - Well... - I'll get dessert ready. - Diego, can you dance salsa? - No. No, not very well. - And "bachata"? - No, worse than salsa. Put on some "bachata", I'm in the mood. I don't have any. I can put on Mozart. C'mon, I'll be DJ. Let's see what I can find. And the Chivas is still in the same place? - Come on. - Let's go! Diego, I'll show you later. What did you think of the script? Diego, aren't you coming? Isabel, open up. If you're going to commit suicide, don't put your head in the oven, it's such a cliche. Why are you shut in here? I wanted a cigarette. Yes. Are you alright? Yes, yes, I'm fine. I feel like shit, but I'm fine. Right, well... I was frantic when Angel said he was getting married again, with you, in particular. It's not that, Susana. Then what? Carlos is the worst. Though I took a while to work that out. Carlos? I thought you two got along great. Don't tell Angel you saw me smoking. There are lots of things I don't tell Angel. That looks great. I had to make two more. No, no, no! This one has no sugar. Try this one. No, you finish your work of art, but hurry, we need a dessert to sweeten this dinner. Susanita, shake your booty. Leave me alone. What are you doing here? Breathing. And preventing anyone from asking me to dance to that junk. - I'm going to bed. - Here we go! How does Isabel seem to you? I don't know, very weird, like she's hiding something. Like she's about to explode. Isabel's always been a tad unstable. You're not cheating on her? I know you. Just what I need. Do you think I treat all my woman badly? In my experience, yes. You're all ruining my night. It's freezing. Are we ever going to talk about the script? Relax, there'll be time. Dessert? Looks delicious! I love it! Carlos, this is for you. Wow! My favourite dessert. Thanks, cutie. That's enough, Alex. Dessert? Stop working. Isabel, Alex, please. Have some fun. I hope you like it. It's really good. Diego likes your wife more than the girl. You just like to annoy me. - Carlos, any tangos? - Sure. - This one? - That's perfect. Alba. Alba, my girl. How are you? How are you? Has something happened? Alba, has something...? You're breaking up, honey. No, you're breaking... Shit! That's it! Diego. This is much more fun, right? Sorry, sorry, sorry. - I don't feel so good. - Too much dope. - We're too old, Carlos. - You might be! Fuck, I'm spinning out. Do you mind? Don't have a girlfriend and an ex? That's why: I like uncharted territory. - I'm spinning. - Alex, honey, - your boyfriend's feeling bad. - He's exaggerating. - Want me to go? - No. He's fine. How do you know? Because I know him. And I'm a doctor. You're a doctor? Yes, I'm doing my residency. Right, what's wrong? My stomach hurts, my head... I'm in a bad way. - Let's walk in the garden. - No, no... I'd rather die on your sofa. You're hilarious tonight. Give him some herbal tea. Doctor's orders! Angel, honey, can you get some herbal tea? Wait, I'll go with you so I can get these legs off me. It's near the sugar bowl, remember? - I feel terrible. - I don't care if you die. If that Alex is a doctor, I'm a stripper. I can't take any more. Why don't you all go? - Where's the herbal tea? - There, in the cupboard. Did you hear me? I'm going to bed. I heard you. I hate parties. This is meant to be a business dinner. And it is. Hey, what's this?! - Is it a cockroach? - A cockroach? Angel! - Why is this in the kitchen? - Rat poison. What's it doing there? It's dangerous, especially with kids in the house. I don't know. Isabel's so flaky. A posh house like this has rats? Yes, it's the drawbacks of living in the country. We can't afford an exterminator. Put the herbs in that. Carlos, not here. Please. No. - Look, there they are. - Herbal tea. Oh, God! Sorry, Angelito. Babe, did you puke? He has to lie down. Come on now. In bed, Carlos. Go on. Isabel, put a towel there, he's going to vomit again. - Okay, stay there. - It really hurts. Come on, Carlos. He's getting worse by the second. Are you really a doctor? Sure, a dentist. Isabel, what the hell made him like this? I don't know! I'm calling a doctor. Let's not get hysterical. - The herbal tea. - He doesn't want it. - Don't stand there gawping. - I'll call an ambulance. It's nausea, not a heart attack! Angel, really! - Don't you trust me? - He wants to vomit. That's good. See? She says that's good. Into the bathroom, Carlos. Carlos, cooperate, for God's sake! Help! Give us a little help. Do you know what's wrong'? It's the third time I've called. Yes, a standard Samsonite. Green. No, not blue, green. Yes, the flight number is... AR080. Yes. No, from Buenos Aires. - What are you doing? - Quiet! Let go of me! I don't know how to say this. What? I think Isabel poisoned Carlos. Oh, please! See? "Ratox, kills rats and mice. Highly effective, easy to use. Contains..." "Death results from non-coagulation of the blood, causing convulsions." Angel, we're in real life, not in one of your novels. Their argument was real, Carlos' convulsions are real, - this rat poison is real. - Sure. And if Carlos had taken just a teaspoonful of this, he'd be dead now. - What happened? - I don't know. Hurry! Hurry! You're pulling me down! Watch out! - Shit! I'm coming! - Go! Go! - Isabel! - What's wrong? - Carlos, please! - What's wrong? Is he dead? - What? - He's dead! He's dead! You said he was alright! - Let me, I'm a doctor. - You're a doctor? - Yes, a psychiatrist. - Diego, he's not breathing. I need to see if he's dead or not. Let me see. - This is impossible! - Calm down, you're in shock. - You're stressed out. - Take her away! He can't be dead! - Alex, you're in emotional shock. - Leave me alone with him. - He's dead! - Alex! Alex! Leave me alone with him. Shut the door. Shut the fucking door. Shut the fucking door! No, it's absurd. It just can't be. I don't believe she killed him. The mousse. The mousse! Isabel made the mousse. A teaspoonful of Ratox... Hold on, hold on... I was in the kitchen with her. She put one aside. She wouldn't let me try it. Well, at least she didn't want to kill me. You don't drink. I've got potato salad on my palate. Shit, this is delicious. I should've known. Isabel hasn't been well for ages. But being an actress, I thought: - "Since she turned 40..." - Sure, she's not as hot now, so she became a killer. Piss off! She's grouchy, sleepless and she's smoking again. Yes, she smoked, she must be a serial killer. I'm trying to make you understand that my wife's out of control! - You said so. - I did? I don't think so. - What are you doing? - This whisky's fucking great. Susana, you're not used to it. Right. Nor am I used to your wife killing her guests. I didn't realize, Diego. I didn't know Carlos was so sick! It's not your fault. No one knew it was so serious. - You won't leave me? - How could I? - I'm so upset! - I know, I know, but... Alex, dear, you'll suffocate Diego. - When these things happen... - Hug me, Diego! Alex, you're hyperventilating. - Breathe along with me. - I can't! - Take in air, let it out. - I can't breathe! Like that. - Do you have a sedative? - Yes, of course. Grandma's remedies. So, will you stop gabbing about it and call the police? And accuse my own wife? Never! Go on, let them interrogate her and we'll see what happens. What'll happen, Susana? They'll interrogate and arrest her. It'll be a scandal, we'll be front page news and the latest trending tropic. Don't try to make me worry. It wasn't her! - Why are you so sure? - There's no motive. No motive, no murder. You should know that better than anyone. They were fighting. - All exes fight. - Something was going on. Yes, Carlos is allergic to cream, - lemon, potato salad... - Shut up and let me think. Let me think. Alright... Why did he come? When I went into the kitchen, there was a paper... that Carlos put away... C'mon, c'mon, let's go. But... Keep a lookout. - For whom? - Keep a lookout! What? But... What are we doing? Diego... How are you? How's it all going? Fine. Alexis with Isabel, she's getting over it. Oh, right, then it's all fine. Why don't you go down and have whisky? It's terrific. I was going to go in, maybe I can... You can't, you can't do anything now. Nothing at all. He's super-dead, totally kaput. Then I'll wait downstairs before I say goodbye. - I'd rather go, if you don't mind. - I don't mind at all. Alright... What are you doing? Hurry up! It's not as if the body's going to get up! - Is Calmacid good? - Quiet! I'm going to take one. I don't think they do anything. Isabel's an addict. This is it! This is it! C'mon! It's from the Tax Department. How dull! I imagined something else. A repossession order! What's this shit! Who's yelling now? No... Stand still! I can't see. Shit, shit, shit! Carlos owes a ton of money. To suppliers, to the Tax Dept... He's a black hole. And? Look who his business partners are. - I can't see a thing. - Isabel... Isabel covered his credit. They're demanding this house, plus 300,000 Euros. No! Carlos ruined her. He ruined us! They're all joint assets. Assets? It was her money and she inherited this house. Let's not nitpick. She hid it all from me. She deceived me, betrayed me! Now I know why she was angry. And in one brilliant move, she knocks him off. - You know what? - You would've killed him too. - She deserves to go to jail. - What are you doing? - Calling the police. - Not a good idea. You said it before. She'll drag us all down with her. Think of the movie. What movie?! For 8 years I've been sleeping next to a murderer. 300,000 Euros. How can I pay that? Hey, kid, if they arrest Isabel, you're sunk. You'll be begging for conjugal visits in prison. Sure! I don't even want to see her. Answer! You'll be taking care of the girl by yourself. Even better. A killer's a bad influence. How can Emergencies be busy? And Dylan. Remember, his dad is dead. You're his guardian now. Dylan's guardian? I can't take any more! No, no, no... How can this be happening to me? No, no, not like this. Have a sip, go on. I have a plan. And you're no good to me if you're hysterical. Why are you so calm? The pill works like a charm. Do you want one? Now I know why she's angry. She found out Carlos was going to Brazil and leaving her in the lurch. Stop it! Shit! - God damn you! - That disgusting! I knew it, I knew it! What is this? A party with a butthead guest everyone laughs at? Quiet, they'll hear you. It's an audition. An audition? They want to audition me? No, it's an audition for Isabel. She dying to be the star and to work with you. Why doesn't she tell her husband? She can't tell Angel, and much less Susana. She's not a big name, they don't like her as an actress, they don't see her in the lead. So she thought she'd kill me to show that she was credible as a murderer. All this was Isabel's idea? You're all psychos in this house. Help us out and I promise you we'll all get treatment. If you uncover all this, you'll screw her up completely. Diego, you understand, right? Yes, I understand. Diego, Diego... I'm freezing. Why don't you move? It's to keep the continuity of the corpse. The continuity. The continuity. The continuity. Fuck, it's not working. Diego? Diego. Sorry we left you standing there. - No, it's alright. - Honey... You really should go. You've been very kind, but this whole mess... Misfortune, death... I'll get you a taxi. - Angel, the phone. - No, wait. Just a moment. What happened tonight, Carlos' death, is not what it seems. Angel, you really love Isabel, don't you? Well, sort of... What? He loves her a lot. He loves her, he'd kill for her. Exactly, I've noticed the tension. The police will come, do an autopsy... Where's the poison? It was Isabel! - Is that whisky? - Yes. Isabel put rat poison in his mousse. - What are you saying? - Why would she do that? No, no, we don't think she wanted to kill him. It was more like - an accident. - An accident? Does she know you know? No, we wanted to give her the chance to explain, then we'll see what happens. It's not easy dealing with all this. The kids... Poor Angel... Angel... This is awful! Fucking hell! The mother of your children, your life companion. You must be in a mess, give me a hug. I'm not leaving, I can't, I don't want to. I won't leave you in a situation like this. You're a good person, I could tell straight away. - Give me a hug too. - Yes, Susana. Yes, together against adversity. There you go. I want to help. What do I do? Can you deep clean? - Blood, for example? - No, dishes. ADULT-FREE ZONE LET ME DO MY THING! I don't get it, I don't. What are they doing? - Why don't they interrogate me? - Relax, Isabel. I don't know. They must be thinking. Shall we rehearse your confession? Okay- What if they don't believe me? You were really overacting. - Me? - Yes, you. Excuse me, I did not overact. Young girls are like that, they overact themselves. You gave me a stereotypical role. It suited the character. A redhead? And dressed like that? - Who'd believe you were a doctor? - Why not? Oh, God! Besides, I said "dentist". And that show you put on? I saved the whole situation. It turns out he's a doctor. Unless I went a bit hysterical he would've cottoned on. You've been glued to him all night long. What did we agree on? That your character was madly in love with Carlos. I know what you're doing. You're trying to get him to notice you. What a girl! I don't believe it! Look, Isabel, I don't need this. I've got a job. Really? In what? Micro-theatre. I write, direct and act. And since it's "micro", you've got lots of spare time. Envy is a sin. I hope I don't end up like you. I'll cause a confrontation. - I'll come too. - No. Stay here, keep quiet and don't move. You're confessing? Then I have to go apeshit! No! No! I'm not going to confess! The idea is for them to accuse me. And only under unbearable pressure, after denying it several times will I give in, break down and fall apart. And put the fucking wig on right. I'll put on the dishwasher. Good. Diego, don't put the dishes in without rinsing. Hand them to me. Grease never comes out in cold water. You're clearing up. Of course, it'd be dead selfish to leave you... I mean, with all this mess, the kitchen... Honey, where's the strong grease remover? Grease remover? The strong one. The grease remover, honey! Here. Well... I'm sorry, but what do you think we should do? You mean...? Carlos? It's great you're so helpful, but we have a body in the bathroom. We have to wait for Alex. After all, she's his girlfriend. Let's see what she wants to do. - How is she? - Who? Alex. Oh! Better, better. After the shock... I think. I'll go see how she is. Tell her to keep breathing. To breathe slowly. Inhale, exhale, let the air out. She's so cold-blooded! My God, I think she's got it all worked out. What? Think about it. Who knows that she poisoned him? - We do. - We do. Exactly. And if we keep quiet and a doctor certifies it was natural causes, it's wrapped up nice and neat. I'm a doctor. He won't be suspicious. Anyway, she has Alex and she's... A complete airhead. Yes, but also a doctor. Therefore, if Alex signs the death certificate, it's all sorted out. I'm convinced that this is Isabel's plan. I'm not saying anything. It looks like she knows my wife better than I do. I'm going. Where? To get some air. Angel, Angel... the three of us are in on this. Idiots! They're complete idiots! And my husband's the worst! We set up a fight, give them a motive, put the murder weapon in the pantry... Perfect! And nothing! It's as if Carlos snuffed it from a bad cold. And he writes those crime novels. Well, if after everything we've set up they still don't get it... ...we go to Plan B. Plan B? We don't have a Plan B. Plan B is: "Confess and that's that". No, no, no. I can't confess. They have to realize it by themselves. Fuck, fuck! What do we do? I can go down. If you trust me, of course. If the press finds out, they'll give us hell. They love jumping on film people. They could say you're a suspect. This is bad We've got no way out. If we keep quiet, we're accomplices. Alex, how are you? So-so. Bad. Have a drink. It'll do you good. I don't want one. This is a bummer. What a horrible death. His heart stopped. A heart attack. He was a smoker, wasn't he? No, that's not what killed him. He was vomiting blood. I think it was internal haemorrhage. It's like... something gnawing away at him inside like... ...a rat. There's no need to give us the details. You're a doctor. Does it look natural to you? No, but I couldn't examine him. I'm telling you, as a colleague, damn it! I think he was poisoned. And it was Isabel. What? Isabel? Why would she do such a thing? I'm completely sure. It's a professional opinion. That's a serious accusation. Do you have proof? Ask her. If it wasn't her, let her deny it. Alex, you're not feeling right. - Susana... - She's in shock. - Neither are you, Susana. - Susana, please. C'mon, off to bed. To bed! To bed! You're smashed! So...? Who's going to say it to Isabel? How long have you known Carlos? - Three... No, four... - Days? He never mentioned you. Months. I'll tell you one thing. My wife and Carlos were together for ten years. They had a child and got along very well. In fact, better than I would've liked... Why is it so hard to ask Isabel? If you saw poor Carlos... What a shame! Do you want to put the love of his life in the electric chair? The mother of his son? Go upstairs, the adults need to talk. Get up there, or... Up you go. Macho man! Macho man! The big man is back! Yes, Susana. Your plan failed. So now keep your mouth shut and let me make the decisions. Everything! I told them everything, just like you said! Your husband thinks you're a saint! He'd cut off his right arm for you! Do you think they know? They're messing with us. No, they believe Carlos is dead and that I know everything! The only character they don't believe is yours. That's it, that's the last straw. You're fired! Get out! Excuse me? - Get out! - No, no, no... You're not firing me. I'm going of my own accord. Whatever you want, but you're out the door. Pay me first. Pay you? Tomorrow. You'll get a cheque tomorrow. And only if you keep your mouth shut. Can you do that? I told you! But, no, you always have it your way! - Shut up, you're making me dizzy. - Now what? What? You don't know how to save us? Lost your messianic powers? Hold on. Why don't you calm down and breathe deeply? I think it's time to talk to Isabel. - No! - No! At least you agree on that. It's because of you, Diego. We've grown so fond of you. Look, it's better that when all this comes out, you're far away. We'll all say we don't know you. That's it. That you never, even EVER. . Set foot in this damned house. Exactly! Carlos was never in this house. He's in worse shape than I am. I wrote that. Why didn't I remember it? - I agree. - What? Oh, I don't know. Anything to get me out of this hell. I need some water. I'll get you some water, but you're fucking smashed. You're such a gentleman. Can I count on you? - Absolutely. - Okay. The only compromising thing is Carlos' body. If we get it out... - The body? Not a good idea. - Are you with me or not? I am, but think it over. The dentist! The dentist! Where are you going? Home. I don't give a shit what mess you're in. I'm going. Listen to me. If you open your mouth, I'll come to your house personally and slice you up? She's bald! You fired her? The little brat was unbearable. Vain, pedantic and a terrible actress. - Are you shagging her? - No! Something's wrong. Something not working. Your marriage, I've told you a thousand times. Leave him. No, not that, I mean our plan. - Nobody found out, did they? - No, nobody. Come here, look at me. By the way. How is it with Peretti? Why? - No reason. - Do you think he fancies me? Stop, stop. Stop it, Carlos. Carlos! Shit! What else can go wrong? No, please. I don't want to see the body. - Angel, just now... - Control her! Free me from this horrible vision, Diego. - Please! - Watch the stairs. Angel! You scared me! What happened? The fuses blew. There's light in the street. Then go fix it. No, I don't know how. - You don't? - You go. - Me? No. - Yes. - Okay, give me your phone. - Susana will go with you. - Why are you talking like this? - I don't know! Fine, I'll go with Susana. - Diego, come on. - Susana, take the stairs. It's not a good idea, Angel. Angel, it's not a good idea. Here. Here. It's here. - What are you looking for? - The car keys. - The car? What for? - Did you hear a noise? A noise? No. Wait, I'll get flashlights. You don't have to speak. Okay- What do we do? Grab his arms. Take this arm, I'll take this one. Pull, pull, pull... He won't fit through the door. - You first. - Drag him. He won't fit. We'll have to cut off an arm. Cut off an arm? To get him out. You're brave. He's coming. Go, go. Here he goes. - The turn! Look out! - Here he goes. Like that. - Wait, wait. - I've got his arms. Here he goes. - Push. - He's coming out. Push. - Now you've blown it. - I hit my head. There. There, push. Susana, please, give it a rest. - I can't see a thing. - It's moving by itself. Give it to me, I'll take it. Give it to me. Really! Scary, huh? You're so drunk. I don't believe it! Stay right here, okay? Fuck, it stinks. Of dead body? No, of piss. Piss? The fucker pissed himself before he snuffed it. - He pissed himself? - I can smell the vapour. Wait, wait. Stop, stop. I'm going to have a heart attack. Put him down. On the floor. Come on. He's sliding down. He doesn't have rigor mortis. - It takes three and a half hours. - How do you know? Exhaustive research for my novels. - Where are you going? - For coats. Use this chance to breathe. What's he doing? Where's he going? I don't know. Don't worry, I think he's taking you home. - Home? What for? - He didn't say. Here, take this coat. Hat. We'll drag him to the car. Watch his head. - The light! - Hurry! - They got the light. - Hurry, hurry! - Where are we going now? - Upstairs, go. Okay- One, two, three! I don't get why I'm doing this. Not like that, you're in the way. Back up. - Does he fit? - Yes. His butt's caught. There you go! - Okay, shut it. - Wait! His arm. - Get his arm in. - Head. Everything inside. Come on, almost there. Let's go. Come on. There. That's it. Angel! Cover me. Cover me, I'm cold. Angel! Don't yell. Angel! - Isn't that Alex? - Stop! I don't know. Where are we going? You haven't read my novel "Murder on the M-40". You'd understand completely. Diego Angel! Diego? Diego? Damn it! Good God! - Hello. - Carlos! - Hello. Hello. - Where are you? What's wrong? Problems. What? I don't understand. Your husband, he's nuts. Don't tell me he found you out? No, I'm hanging in there, I'm hanging in there. Carlos? How are you doing? - Get me out of here. - I can't. - In a little while. - No, Diego! Perfect! 14 metres. A little push and the car's down the ravine. Did you see me brake? Like the car skidded. I've written about these situations for 15 years. 15! For the first time I'm the protagonist. I feel alive! Thanks to you, my friend. The gas, the gas... If the car burns, there's no body, so no autopsy. It's all worked out. Help me. Bring the body, we'll make like he was driving. I can't. - I have to do everything! - Angel, listen to me. I have something to tell you. My prints, they're on it. We have to wipe them off. Find some branches. Angel, are you aware that if you let this car fall, you'll be the accomplice of a woman who's cheating on you? What? Isabel's cheating on you with Carlos. No, he's conning her! Isabel lent him money. All of our money. Why didn't she say anything? That bitch. She was cheating on me with Carlos. Let's go. Diego. Let's go, Diego. Diego, let's go. What's wrong? Come on now. Have some coffee and get over it. Go on. You hurt me, Isabel. I like you. I want us to get along. Please, I'm begging you. I think you're an extraordinary woman. - No, you don't like me. - Yes. No, because I'm... I'm terse... and grumpy. No, silly! No, I think you're strong and super-smart. I'd like to have half the personality you have. You're so... so sweet... and so... sensitive... and so pretty. Isabel, my love, let yourself go. If I did, I'd smack you one. What's wrong with you? I've always fancied you, ever since we met. Why did you go with Angel? Because I like men? - No, don't answer it. - Why not? - It's Dylan. - Wait. Son. BOTH gm Hold on, I can't hear you. Don't go, Isabel! Between women it's all so much more... feminine. Dylan... Now. What's wrong...? What's wrong with Estrella? She broke both her wrists? Well, son, something always goes wrong. I sound weird? I do not sound weird. Hey, are you driving? Then hang up. Then I'll hang up. Stop! - Stop! - What is it? People on the road. C'mon, Diego. An accident! An accident! - What's wrong? - There's been an accident. - What? - Open the door! - An accident. - Is it serious? It's a family car. Get on. - Did you call an ambulance? - Diego! - Call an ambulance or the police. - Right away. It's behind that pine tree. - He's gone. - What pine tree? - What are you doing? Are you crazy? - We're going. Going where? To my house. Open the door, you fuck! Are you alright? Stop! Stop, damn it! Stop! Come on. A little more. Perfect. There you go. And where's my husband? What a pain in the ass! Why do you only think of Angel? - I love you, Isabel. - Yes. I said I love you, so much that I don't care what you've done. What have I done? Isabel, it was an accident. - You didn't mean to kill him. - Who did you tell? I know, my love. Who did you tell? Who knows? I'm sorry to tell you, but we all do. Everyone? Everyone, everyone? My husband and Diego too? We'll sort it out, don't worry. Thank you, thank you! - I love you so much. - Really? Of course. Yes, but don't kiss me. Stop it. It's a bus. - Where were you? What happened? - Why the bus? He hijacked it. Where's Carlos? I mean, his body? Dance? Tell me, honey, is your ex better in the sack? Give it to me straight, is his bigger? Does he make you scream more? You sure scream with me. - You scream and scream...! - Not as much as you. - What's wrong with you? - After what I've done for you. After what I've put up with! You're a disaster! You spend a fortune on face creams and toilet paper! You should see the rate we get through toilet paper! Our money goes down the toilet! And I don't like cheese from Burgos! How can I tell you?! Every Sunday morning: "Here, honey, your cheese". And Dylan is subnormal, he never passes anything! I did it all for love! You don't know what that is! Meanwhile, you're fucking that guy with nothing to say! Is this subnormal saying you were sleeping with your ex? What does that matter? Where's Carlos? That's taken care of at the bottom of a ravine. What? Diego, speak. Please. - He can't, he's lost his voice. - What have you done? You slit his throat? You animals! You've got no idea. She's the one that killed him. We just got rid of the body. A bit clumsily, because we had no time to put him behind the wheel. He went down the ravine and it caught fire. He was alive, you idiot! It was all fake! He was alive? I saw him dead, didn't I? We fooled you. It was her bright idea. It was a set-up. A set-up? I put him in the trunk and pushed him down the ravine. - What are you saying? - You killed him! Are you saying... that... I killed Carlos? Oh, my God! Is there the slightest chance, however small, that he survived? Oh, God... it's all your fault! I'm not going to jail! I'm warning you, I'm not going to jail! It's him! Him! The dead man's calling. But... This is scary, it's like "Ghost Hunters"! Please, be rational! Someone's found his phone. It'll be the police, don't answer it! Carlos? Carlos, my love! You're alive! Alive? Of course I am, though my ankle, some ribs and my phone screen are all busted. But I've still got the strength to kill somebody. Is Angelito alright? He is? No, no reason. That's lucky. Just as well! Be very careful, honey. Yes, very much. See you soon. What? What happened? The trunk was open and he jumped. He's fine I'm okay now. Sorry. Post-traumatic stress. I'm fine now. - Whisky? - Yes, please. I got my voice back. Thanks. Sorry. Honey, cheer up. Let's forget all about it. You called him "my love"? You all heard her. She said "my love". Not again! What a pain in the ass! Look at me and tell me you're not involved with him. Of course she's not involved with him, get it through your head. I'm sick of all this. Carlos is my lover, yes. I sleep with him sometimes because I like him, he makes me laugh and he thinks I'm clever, not like you. - I knew it. - Please, let's not argue. The main thing is that it's all sorted out and we can make the movie. Fuck the movie, you, you and the whole planet! My wife is insane, she's involved with her ex. I'm a sucker. But kid... I've discovered I'm an alcoholic and a lesbian, and it's fine. Diego. What? Tell us you'll make the movie. Do you really think I'd want to make a movie with a pack of loonies like all of you? Thanks a lot, sir. Really, thanks a lot. It's been a pleasure... No, I'm fine, I'm fine. Don't worry, I'm fine. They'll be blown away when they see we're back. Mom's so hysterical... Look, dolly, we're home. - What's that? - What's a bus doing out front? Stop, I dropped my dolly. - My dolly! - Dylan, stop! Wait, I'll put it in reverse. What...? No, no, no! - Fucking hell! - We ran over something! Look, I'll tell you the truth. The script wasn't believable. A woman capable of manipulating everyone? A compulsive liar they all love? I've never met a woman like that, ever. Until tonight. Do you mean me? If you don't know... Dad! Dad! The children! Mom! - Mom! - Oh, God! - Dad! - Mom! My God, Dylan! What have we done? Dad! - What happened? - It's terrible! Where's Estrella? She's fine, but we ran over him! - Mom! - Carlos! - Come here, Mom! - Carlos! - Oh, my God! - Mom, I think I killed Dad! No, son. I killed him. My God, Carlos! Mom... My love, we're all here, your family, your friends... the women who loved you. You're unforgettable, my love. You gave us all your lust for life. You gave us your generosity and warmth, and I don't know how we'll live without you. Many people won't understand what bound us together. An indestructible bond... that is beyond death... and will never separate us. Too late. No, no! Cut! Cut the water! Extras out for a moment, please. Extras out! Babe... Nice! Nice! It was beautiful, beautiful. Isabel, it's "indestructible link". What did you say? - "Indestructible link". - I thought it sounded great. It's written for a reason, honey. Someone told Susana we were changing it. Then I'll just take the pages and throw them out. If this is no good, I'll throw them out! THE NIGHT MY MOTHER KILLED MY FATHER
