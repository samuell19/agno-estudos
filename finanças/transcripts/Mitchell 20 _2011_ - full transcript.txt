Mitchell is in an area of high poverty, high crime, situations that speak to low socio-economics. To be a teacher at Mitchell you have to really be a special person. You have to get to know the students and the challenges that they're living with day to day. There's this great misconception. Schools within inner cities are painted as, as these places where kids are just thrown into and kids don't really wanna be there. Dangerous. Just because this is a struggling community, it doesn't mean that all students will struggle academically. Too often educators can say, they can't reach this, they won't be this, because of this, this, this and this. And I think everyone here at Mitchell challenges that and says, "No, they can." Daniela Robles is a second generation career teacher who started teaching at Mitchell thirteen years ago as a student teacher. Unfortunately, unfunded federal and state mandates, pressure to teach to standardized tests, and scripted curriculum caused Daniela to question her calling. I was lost. I was confused. I was in a state, almost of constant bewilderment, because I didn't know who I was anymore. And when I began to read through National Board Certification, I said, "Here's the pinnacle, here's the pinnacle." In 2007 Daniela decided to focus on the one thing that she had control over: the quality of her teaching. She decided to attempt, and she achieved, National Board Certification, a process that is compared to lawyers passing the bar and doctors becoming certified. National Board Certification is the gold standard of teacher quality. After she completed her National Board Certification, it was just like a metamorphosis. She's taken on this role of what can I do now to help my co-workers become the best that they can be. And I began to think who's going to be next? I knew it was going to be my Mitchell family. She challenged these teachers to give up their personal time to improve their teaching and to verify it. She challenged them to attempt National Board Certification, and 20 teachers said yes. - These 20 teachers are not only volunteering to do the extra work, they are putting their reputations and careers on the line. They are stepping up to find their voices all in an effort to improve their practice. An option that has not been available because for the last eight years all of their professional learning has been mandated by the district. Daniela found a single ally at the district office, and Principal Crawford did something few principals have ever done. She committed a significant part of her federal funding to the National Board Certification process, and she opened it up for as many staff as would apply. Daniela started a fire. My message was: this is about you. This is your choice. - My arm was twisted. - I'm just kidding. Persuasive encouragement I would call it I was really doing it because everybody else was doing it. I'm like don't let anybody hear that. The reason I went into this I think was the faith of others. I was a little bit nervous about it at first, but then I got to read more about it and understand it, and I said, "This is, I need to do this." Every once in a while you just wake up and you say, "You know what? I need something, I need something challenging." And I'm hearing this is very challenging program. It's a very rigorous program and so it's time to make that next step. I've told every teacher that I know anywhere about what's going on here at Mitchell. Even if we only get two people across the line. We're going to be an A+ school. Oh my gosh, it gives me goosebumps. I think it's just awesome. It does stress me out a bit, because I don't want to be that one teacher who doesn't certify The teacher is the main determinant of whether or not a child is gonna succeed in education, and I would suggest to you ultimately in life. If we don't have knowledgeable, supported, committed teachers in every classroom, we're not going to be able to enable all children to learn to the levels that they need to in this 21st century economy. The most important factor in determining a student's academic success isn't race, isn't class, isn't socio-economic status, it's the quality of the teacher in front of his or her classroom, and you can take the average child, the average student, give them three great teachers in a row, and that average child will be a year and a half ahead of where they should be. Take that average child and give them three poor teachers in a row and that student unfortunately will be so far behind it'll be hard for them to ever catch up. So there's nothing more important we can do than to give every single child in this country a great, great teacher. I think that, that this group will make other teachers see that this is possible. Working together as a group, we can really impact our students' lives, our teachers' lives. They're going to see a lot of leaders come out of this group of teachers, a lot of strong leaders. It is critical for schools to have strong teacher leaders working with strong principals because together they know what's best for their students and will guide and apply their professional learning to meet those needs. I can't think of anything that is more important than ensuring that all of our children and our students receive a quality education. We know that by doing so that we are going to help them have a better quality of life. This is my 16th year in the Isaac School District. Only three years of that was at another school and that was when I left to become an assistant principal. Luckily I got to come back to Mitchell as the principal. The Mitchell story is unique, because the vast majority of National Board Certified teachers reside in wealthier suburban school districts, often leaving students in our impoverished schools with our least experienced teachers. The very place we need our most experienced teachers. In the current attack on teachers it is completely overlooked that students in schools with less than 10% poverty are number one in international rankings. If our poor students scored at the same rate as our affluent students, our country would jump to number one in the world. Poverty matters. The schools teaching poor students must be our priority. Hi guys, how are you? Good! The teachers here care about kids. It might be easier for them to go to a more affluent area and teach, but they know that these are the kids that really need them and they're going to be the very best that they can be. I do teach because I love it. I was born to be a teacher. I think I teach because it was my calling. Since I was that big I wanted to be a teacher. ♫ It's your thing ♫ Do what you wanna do ♫ I wanna make a difference in these students' lives. A person in my students' lives that they remember. Every student needs positive role models and I can be that role model. I can be the best teacher possible. I want to expand my knowledge. And learn through this experience. To make as many changes as I can in the lives of my students. I teach because I wanna make a difference. Everybody that works here has the same conviction, the same passion, the same love to be the best that they can be for their students. ♫ It's your thing ♫ Do what you wanna do ♫ I had a career day in high school where a disgruntled teacher came in and did a speech about her experience as a teacher and basically told us that we didn't want to become teachers because teachers didn't get paid enough money so I thought, being 16 years old, "Okay, I'm gonna go to the corporate world, because you make a lot of money there." Worked in the corporate world as a project manager at a marketing company and in 2001 was laid off. And it was the best day of my life. ♫ It's your thing ♫ Do what you wanna do ♫ I have two parents that were educators. My father passed away when I was nine and my mother pretty much lived his dream of becoming a school principal, and so she worked tirelessly to make that dream come true and be able to provide for us as a single parent. She taught me that no matter where you work you do your best and simply because all kids deserve the best. Well, I'm originally from South Central Los Angeles. I grew up in the inner city. My father never went to school. He was a farmer, he worked with his hands, and he told me, he told me once that when I was younger, he said, "You know I didn't come to this country to waste my time. I came to this country to to make a family, to be the best I can be and to help you be the best you can be. I am a single mother, and it was my family who said, "You know what, we're gonna support you to get an education. If you're, you know, working and going to school and being a mother, at that rate you won't ever finish." So my family said concentrate on your education and allowed me to get my bachelor's, my master's degree, so family has just been very supportive. Kimberly's family extends into the Mitchell family. Her aunt Billie Williams, a 21 year veteran of teaching, has served as her mentor and is working towards full certification. While student teaching, Billie became Daniela's mentor. ♫ I am every day before ♫ I'm a native of Arizona. My first language was Spanish, so when I started kindergarten, that's all I knew was Spanish, and so throughout kindergarten I just picked up the English language and ever since I just always was very involved in my education and always wanted to become a teacher. ♫ We gotta live together ♫ I moved to Arizona two years ago to get my first teaching job. I definitely grew up in an area where we maybe had one African American student and maybe three Hispanic students in my class. Being here at this school in this community, I feel like the minority. Unlike Amy, many of the Mitchell 20 are minority educators and immigrants themselves who sought out this opportunity to work with English language learners and minority children because of their life experience. My parents are from India, and they did immigrate here in the 60s so their children could have a better life. They were just advocating my education all the time. I'm Chinese American but I was actually immigrated when I was seven. I went to New Mexico, and as a seven year old I thought out, "Wow, I'm going out west." I had my red boots on, I had my cowboy hat on, and then I got there and it was nothing like that. When I came to the United States, I was placed in a second grade classroom but because of my language, I was very clueless as to what was happening around me. Nobody spoke my language or looked like me or anything. So it was very different, I definitely stood out. I was lower than most kids because my vocabulary was lower because my parents didn't speak English, but my parents were educated so that gave me an advantage. Most of my students are from outside of the country and I am that student who comes into the classroom without knowing English. I am that student who's feeling anxiety in not knowing what's in front of them. I am that student who doesn't understand, doesn't know why the teacher is talking to them. ♫ Because I am everyday people ♫ Kids need to see teachers that look like them. I'm saying that as the biggest single demographic out there in the teaching force, which is white women. Not that if you're not a minority you cannot relate, but I think it does have a greater impact on those students because we all bring our own perspective and world view into everything we do. So as a result, those students get to see a model of someone who has done what some people have told them they can't do. One, two, three, four, how many do you guys have left? Four! So everyone's answer should have been? Four! Teachers care. We have high expectations for our kids even though they are not coming in reading ninety words a minute, we try our hardest to get them there, and we know that they're going to become somebody they're gonna come out of this neighborhood and become leaders in our community, become a teacher, become a police officer, become the next Cesar Chavez. We can have the next president in one of our classes, born here, Hispanic, why not? Today if you are a student of color, if you're a student who lives in poverty, the chances of you receiving an excellent education are very slim. This is historical in terms of bringing less qualified teachers to the most disadvantaged students. We've been doing this for years, I may even say decades. If we can ensure that every child has an accomplished teacher than we're gonna also ensure that every child has the skills that they need to work their way out of poverty. Students from poor environments from low-income communities, often from minority backgrounds, are actually benefitting more from board certified teachers than teachers who are not board certified. Professional development is big business. Publishing companies, their powerful lobbyists and philanthropists, exert tremendous influence on policies around professional development and student learning. The United States spends over three billion dollars a year on professional development. Yet when you talk to teachers, many will say the professional development they are forced to participate in does little to change practice or impact student learning. It's no wonder. The primary motive of the for-profit publishing companies is profit, not the specific needs of students or even teachers. Most of the time it's one size fits all. We have three point four to four million teachers in this country depending on how you count them. And for the most part we perhaps just think of them as all alike as widgets to be molded in a certain way. Most professional development is the one shot drive by 'spray and pray' workshop where you hear an expert for a couple of hours, they go away, and you're supposed to apply it in your classroom. I think before when I'd hear professional development I would think of trainings, having to sit there and listen to lectures and hear strategies. Here you go, just you know, telling us how to do things. When a district is in charge of your professional growth, it isn't always something that I need to improve on or something that I need to get better at doing. It's more of a blanket for everybody. You just kind of, you know, sit there because you have to be there. ♫ R-E-S-P-E-C-T ♫ Find out what it means to me ♫ R-E-S-P-E-C-T ♫ Take care, TCB ♫ Oh ♫ A little respect ♫ I think one of the biggest complaints about professional development is that it's not meaningful and applicable to our classroom, but whereas with National Board everything you do is meaningful and applicable. We have a lot of evidence that effective professional development that changes practice is both long in duration, it's connected to work with children, it's connected to work around the subject area and it involves other colleagues in a reflection and coaching and inquiry process, and that kind of professional development, in fact, does lead to improvements in student learning. It's not prescriptive. It goes beyond surface features of teaching and goes right down into the heart of teaching which is causing learning and teachers who can articulate the learning that they've caused, no matter how they did it, are valued. ♫ All I'm askin' ♫ Is for a little bit of respect when you come home ♫ Baby ♫ It makes a teacher look like a superman, super teacher. Like wow, if I can accomplish all these standards? It's something almost, when I first glanced at them, I thought they were impossible, but then I started reading them and lookin' and going into them and I thought to myself, "I do these things, I just don't do it the extent" so I wanted to just kind of fine tune what I'm doing now and then take it to that next step. There is a high price tag for this type of professional development. Years ago policymakers understood its value and provided funding to offset the fee and salary incentives to those who achieve. While there was little salary incentive, the Mitchell 20 received significant support from the school's federal allocation and the Arizona K-12 Center, a statewide professional development center for teachers. S-at… word? - Is it real or nonsense? Real. - Real. In April 2008, the teachers begin their long haul towards improved teaching practice. Of the Mitchell 20, eight are attempting full National Board Certification, a demanding year long process that requires them to videotape themselves in class, reflect on and analyze their teaching, and prove through four written entries, videotapes and student work, that shows their students are learning over time. All to illustrate their teaching meets the rigorous standards of the National Board. When the portfolio of their work is complete, they will sit for an exam designed to assess their content knowledge. The other 12 are participating in Take One, a single piece of the full process. While taking less time to complete, a teacher must still show student learning over time, and the standards in their practice. So we have four, let's read our equation so far. Four take away one equals - And what are we missing, what are we missing? Equals. Let's see if Cassandra remembers what the equals sign looks like. There you go. It's not just me doing this but Ms. Garcia who's right next door, Ms. Chu who's right across, Ms. Torres and Ms. Gammage, the whole third grade as a matter of fact. So they're, they see that and they're like wow, our teachers are really into this. Turn that on to play and then the computer will recognize that. Okay. Teachers in nations with high performing schools like Finland have 10 to 20 hours built into their week to work with colleagues - critiquing lessons, examining student work and developing curriculum. However, teachers in the United States have less than three hours a week to work with their colleagues. Each of the Mitchell 20 will need to devote many evenings and weekends to the process, above and beyond their regular work schedule and their personal lives. By the time they finish, they will have spent more than 300 hours to complete the entire process. This commitment will take its toll on the Mitchell 20. In terms of the process, still haven't written anything down, so I'm not reaching my goal yet. I plan on leaving after I videotape and going home and getting to work, so keep your fingers crossed. It always feels like I'm behind. It's like no matter how organized I am, still behind. ♫ You better keep on ♫ Keep marching on ♫ You better keep on ♫ Deep into the process, tension is mounting and the stress is trying the group. ♫ You better keep on ♫ Two of the Mitchell 20 decide that this is not their year and they are pulling out. The rest of the group is committing themselves and continuing on despite the hardship. I should know you never ever have a perfect year, but I am wearing my little bear. Let me show you my bear, see how he's hanging in there? And every year about this time I have to realize that you hang in there and good things do come. Last night I had kind of a little meltdown , everything just kind of piled up and I feel like I'm behind, I feel like there are all these things that I should have been doing that I didn't do. I wanna give a 110% every day to what I do in my classroom but then, you know, I have to do National Board. I'm having trouble juggling. It's like trying to juggle an apple and a watermelon at the same time. You know, there's like, it's just very unbalanced and I'm struggling, I find it very difficult. There's been a couple of times where I wanted to quit, I just didn't want to do it anymore. ♫ Keep on marching on out ♫ Have you guys ever seen your reflection in the water? Have you, Jose? It sounds pretty cool, huh? If you think about a typical school historically, tradition have been that the teacher closes the door and that no one really knows what goes on in the classroom except the students and that teacher. Teaching is ultimately a team sport. Collaboration is at the heart of any effective school. There's no single adult who by themselves can know everything, do everything, create the culture that will allow a child to grow and learn from grade to grade and across classrooms. I see every group working as a team, collaborating with each other, and not only lesson planning but making important decisions for our children. There's a lot more openness because we all kind of speak the same language. We're all afraid, but we're all walking together, and we're all gonna try to do this to the best of our ability, then it's comforting. You know what I mean? You feel that support and you're walking forward, and sometimes you wanna back, but you can't because someone's pushing you from behind. We're finding that there's much more power in the experience if they are able to go through the experience with their colleagues and when that happens, lots of exciting things are possible. I have been here 22 years and I haven't seen that passion for collaboration, working together knowing they'll all fail or we all succeed. Max and I went to play with the baby. We went outside. I think that, I know it's for my students. When I ask them a question, whether they are right or wrong, I'll always have them explain my answer, to explain their answer. I went into the lounge the other day and here are six teachers engaging about a lesson. This is the lounge. This is when everything but instructional talk should be taking place, and there it was. One of the things that I- - That's been probably the most exciting piece of this. It's so profound when you can walk onto our campus, and you can see all the signs on the doors that say videotaping, and people are out there putting their practice for everyone to see. Our students know that their teachers are learning, that they're trying to be better. That's powerful. How are you going to conclude this? Something to think about. You don't have to the answer the question. I just want you to think about it. Show me your combination along with your diagram tree. One of the requirements of National Board is that candidates must submit videotapes of themselves teaching. Teachers will use these videos to closer examine their practice, and its impact on their students. The power emerges when teachers view these lessons with their colleagues. When he was saying, "Okay, how did you get it? What did you do to solve the problem?" He kind of started to understand how to do it, so he was like, "Okay, 30 + 30 and then +30 and yeah." It is this type of self-examination that allows for reflective professional growth. When I watch my videos I get very frustrated. I know how I want to impact my students but it's just not showing yet, and so I just need to continue pulling that out of myself to just make myself change some of my habits that I have with teaching and just get past that point of maybe stereotypes that I've formed for myself and just completely just give myself to teaching. It's a challenge making me look at myself and my students and what I need to do to reach every student and make sure that they are focused, make sure that they are paying attention and that they're not playing with their markers while I'm teaching somewhere else. I need eyes all over my head. How many of you have seen Pinocchio? I've seen all three of the movies. Among the Mitchell 20 all but a few have kids of their own, and four of them are single parents. The struggle of taking on a professional learning opportunity like this is above and beyond what the teachers are already doing for their students and is taking them away from their own kids and families. I'm one of those people that can get so stressed I can make myself like sick. I have a headache and I know it's only because I know I have this to do, I have you know, work for my school, I have the kids' stuff. I have sixteen month child, a baby girl, and it's definitely taking away time from her and it kills me because all I wanna do when I get home or on the weekends is spend the most time that I can with her and my husband. Mom, momma? Thank you very much. Full candidacy was really hard. It was really time consuming, taking away a lot of time from the girls and then with the complications I've been having with the pregnancy it was really hard cause I didn't have time to actually sit down and give it all the time and effort that I wanted to do, and now with the changing to the Take One has really helped me a lot. I'm able to relax a little bit more. It is the spring of 2009 and Marisa, Zenaida, Vanessa and Benny are expecting new additions to their families. Due to Vanessa's pregnancy, she's dropping out of the process. I wasn't able to prioritize, everything was priority. I just had to start choosing, and getting pregnant and I had a lot of major complications and I was at the doctor quite a bit in the beginning and still now, so I kind of had to choose my own health over anything else. Get in line guys, second set of teams are up. I'm gonna be a father in August. I'm really excited about that. It's been on my mind every day, every night It's awesome. I was just reflecting a few days ago, thinking "you know I love my students so much, how much am I going to love my own child?" Are we taking away or adding? Adding. We're in the homestretch and we have the next two weeks to really just focus on our portfolio entries and just trying to get everything taken care of. We have four weeks until the deadline. I'm really focused and trying to complete by March 13th. We'll see how that goes, but this has been a really good quarter. A lot of a-ha moments, and my students have started to make some significant progress. The extra work that I put in definitely paid off. Show your ninety four cents. Tell me what you used. Half a dollar. Half a dollar, okay. Two dimes. Two dimes? I believe that everyone will make it. We've started something at Mitchell, and we'll finish it. It just seems that we've grown a lot closer to where last year you know, they were my peers and coworkers. And now it's like we became a family By March 31st the seven full candidates have to submit their portfolio entries, while the 10 Take One participants have until April 15th. I can tell Daniela I will turn it in, I will mail the entries in. The quality, that's something different you know? What happens after that, no one knows. So we know these rubrics. You can hear about rigor, and you can hear other people's stories, but until you're there and it's for yourself, you're not gonna be able to know that. So I think we have had a lot of shock. Maybe a little fear because what that shock has meant and kind of the reality of it all. Everyone's still saying, "But you know what? I see why I'm doing this." On top of the pressure of finishing their submissions, Arizona has fallen into a very serious budget crisis and the state's legislative leadership is advocating deep cuts for education, firing teachers and requiring larger class sizes. The state education community and parents rally in a desperate plea to fight off cuts and members of the Mitchell 20 are there. Save our schools, save our schools. Save our schools, save our schools, Save our schools, save our schools. Save our schools! Just weeks after the rally on March 31st of 2009, the full candidates submit their portfolios to be assessed by reviewers all over the country. Hold on, I'm coming, where the color copier? Over there, let's go - Okay here girls. They now have to wait eight months for their results. Of the over 10,000 applicants nationwide, less than half will achieve. Throughout the year, Mitchell teachers have to deal with many life complexities related to having a large immigrant population. These issues are compounded by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's immigration sweeps. The immigration situation caused a number of our students to move away. Our student population in my school is down about 200 students, because of the crack down I guess you would call it. My mom she take to me school because I was good and I say thank you. She brings you to school? And what's your school's name? - Mitchell. Mitchell, good job. - They're afraid to speak out. Okay if I say this, where is it gonna lead to? Is this gonna make me lose my job? People don't feel safe about sending their children to school, because they're afraid that someone's gonna take them away from them. So that's where I have to come in as a teacher and just let them know that they are in a safe environment when they're with me. The 2008-2009 school year is turning out to be a tough year for the Mitchell 20. The rally did little to change the political realities in Arizona, and the state legislature cut more than 200 million from the state's education budget. Thank you, the T-H-E lady L-A-D-Y had Had. - No. No. - Food. Food. - In. In. - Her. Her. - Garden. Garden. They're having a budget cut at the wrong place because the schools, I think they should be getting more. These are our children and with limited funding there's only so much that you can do. Three, four, five, six. We're gonna lose a lot of our first year teachers and I think that's gonna affect us all with our class sizes. And it just seems like everything that we're going through is just added pressure. - Brian visited his grandma's house. How can we change this to make it possessive? Think about it. Think about it, how you gonna change Grandma? I mean it all starts with teachers. Doctors had teachers, the Governor had a teacher, the President had teachers. I mean you know, without teachers no other profession is possible, right? Every year schools must meet the federal standard known as adequate yearly progress or AYP. With the ultimate goal that in the year 2014 every single child in the United States, 100% of our students, will be proficient on the state exams. While states make every attempt to meet this noble but impossible federal rating, punitive policies and regulations have been put in place when districts and individual schools do not meet the AYP standard. This system is causing some schools to cheat and some states to lower already lowered standards to help their outward appearance of success. Many attribute this effort of arbitrary labels as a clever ploy to paint schools in poor neighborhoods as failing, allowing an easier opportunity for privatization. At the close of the 2008-2009 school year, Mitchell does not meet AYP, due to the performance of just one subgroup - fourth grade English language learners in the subject of reading. As a result of substandard performance of 44 fourth graders out of more than 700 students, the entire school is put on warning, delivering a devastating blow. That was difficult you know to hear that, because you know we work so hard through the year to make AYP. There's a tremendous amount of growth, and for this one test that determines whether we did well or we didn't do well it's just like I don't know. Everybody put their best effort forward. I know that and for that, and for that to not be enough was very, very frustrating. I was pretty disappointed. I was thinking that my class would do a lot better than they did, and I felt like I was teaching a lot stronger, and then to see that it was kind of like "oh, maybe not." The team is feeling beat up after the immigration sweeps, budget cuts and the lower than expected AYP scores. I think right now there is a move to eradicate public education, and I think that move has momentum because it's so easy to point the finger and to say not there, they're not doing it there, because their kids can't do it. Their kids speak another language. There's an assumption that all Hispanics are less capable. There is an assumption the majority of the Hispanics are illegal. There's an assumption the majority of our students are illegal. That's what the world thinks. With that assumption there's an underlying feeling that because we're going to assume they're illegal, because we're going to assume that they are less than, that it's okay if we know the schools that they attend aren't the same as the schools that other children attend. The idea that no matter where you live no matter who your parents are, their economic status, that your dreams can be achieved and the vehicle is public education. The idea that we don't find a way to make that happen for every child in America is, we just can't tolerate that end result. Hands down, there's a moral obligation to provide every child with high quality education, period. With the 2009-2010 school year beginning, the Mitchell 20 bring what they learned through the National Board process to their classroom practice, while they eagerly await notice of whether or not they achieved. This journey to improve their teaching practice began a full and tumultuous year ago. Now it's 7 AM. Their results will be made available online for each teacher to access. This is a waiting game. It's different when it's just you. It's kind of, you're just, you know, your individual piece of "okay, if I make it, if I achieve, I achieve." If not, it's just on a very one person basis, but then when you look at this group, you just can't help but feel like you're just invested in everyone. There's eight minutes until seven. I'm very nervous, very nervous. I'm so excited for them, for all the hard work that they've put in to this process and just, these are my kids, and I'm proud of what they've done. Try again, are you there? Okay, I'm ready. All righty. - Interventions with an s right? Full candidates will see a screen notifying them if they have achieved. All of the candidates are looking for a score of 2.75 or greater. Yay! What does the score have to be? I don't remember. You have to have at least a 2.75. Okay, so barely, I missed it. 2.625, close. No. So I didn't make it. Okay, I didn't make it. Mine is no. No what? You can't get in? No, it's no. Thank you for your hard work and dedication, although your performance on the first attempt did not meet the standards Oh my god. established on the board of directors. It's okay! We encourage you to continue. Okay, I'm going to go on and look. - Mine's a no. Oh my god, I don't wanna know now. Oh my god! Congratulations! One year has passed since the Mitchell teachers decided to attempt National Board Certification. Seven of them attempted full candidacy, and only Tina achieved. 10 of them attempted Take One, and Amy, Laura and Sylvia achieved. The Mitchell teachers had a great deal of expectation wrapped up in this moment and were optimistic that the vast majority would achieve. The results are devastating, but like every day, today they have a job to do. They are teachers. An apple? Thank you, Michael. My dad has been a great supporter. He's been like, we're still gonna open the champagne on Thanksgiving cause everybody's gonna be in town and all my family knew about it So it's, I mean, and I had many text messages from my friends this morning, cause they all knew I was getting my scores today. So it's really nice to know that everybody really cares about me and wanted me to do my best. After Chhaya and Shellie got their scores, I almost didn't want to get it. All three of us worked so closely together, and were so involved with each other's work. I know I could have done it. I know it, I know it, seriously, but I just had to put my heart into it more. I think, like, my mind was there, and I think my writing was pretty solid, but I know I could put more energy into it, more heart into it and I'll get it next time. This journey was about growing and learning, and if that's truly what the journey is, then that's what's been accomplished and the people that perhaps did not achieve, I think the message that I'm hearing from them is, "Okay, well, I'm gonna continue on." I mean, past the heartbreak and the incredible disappointment, you can still hear that piece of "okay, well, this, you know, isn't what I expected, but I do know that I'm not going to quit." Even if I had not accomplished, I think I still got out of it what I needed to, and it's really personal, and I think everybody here is probably experiencing that as well. That they took from it every thing that they could and that's all you could hope for. M-O-T-H-E-R, a mother. I have so much admiration for that team of teachers in Mitchell. First time I've heard of basically almost an entire school coming together, every single one saying, "We're gonna take our game, we're gonna take our craft, we're gonna take our ability to change students' lives to an entirely different level." They stick together over the next couple years? You'll see a school serving children with some real challenges. You'll see that school get dramatically better. Unfortunately, sticking together is not in the cards for the Mitchell 20. We were getting a lot of good feedback that there were some really good things happening at Mitchell. Our attempt as a district is to spread that wealth. We wanna see those kinds of things happen at other schools and as you know, some schools are in greater need, have greater needs and so we try to put our resources sometimes where our greatest need is at. On February 1st I was called in to meet with my assistant sup and director of leadership, and I was informed that I was going to be moved to a middle school, and basically they gave me about a week turnaround to make this transition occur. I had no say in the matter, I remember looking at Mrs. Crawford, my principal, and as a teacher I mean that's, you know, if I think about chain of command, that's who you constantly, that's who you go to. And so I remember looking at her and being told you know, your principal has no say in this. And I just remember sitting there. You know, sometimes I think we can think about events in our life where we're put in our place. And that's exactly, you know, how I felt. The power structure of the public education system is a pyramid with the president at the top. As you move down through the layers of policymakers, bureaucrats and boards, you'll find the teachers at the very bottom, without a real voice in the policies or practices of their profession. This top down style of management has lost ground in the business world, yet is institutionalized in our public education system. While Daniela was confronting her involuntary transfer, the Mitchell family rallies to find a way to keep her at Mitchell. New leaders in the group emerge and get a petition signed by every member of the staff asking for Daniela not to be transferred. The stress level at Mitchell is high, and having an effect on the teachers. On April 30th, the situation gets worse. The Arizona legislature passes even deeper budget cuts to education. Yet, with all of these distractions, these teachers forge on. The six who did not achieve National Board Certification are in the midsts of redoing their entries, and Amy and Kimberly are now working on their first attempt at full certification. And within days Reuben will find out he is going to be transferred. When you work for the district, you can be assigned to any school. The Mitchell school is very important to me and the teachers there, but they are not more important to me than the other schools and the other teachers. I mean that, people need to realize you need to sit in this chair, walk in my shoes, and you'll see all decisions that we make are based on what's in the best interest of the school district. I wrote my letter of resignation the week that all of the turmoil was going on. I knew that they didn't want someone in the district that would support teachers, so I was prepared to turn that letter of resignation in any time I needed to. It is kind of sad if people made it personal, because it never really was. The petition to keep Daniela at Mitchell made it to the district office, and as a result, threats of an insubordination investigation were brought against the Mitchell staff. On Tuesday morning after the Easter break, Principal Linda Crawford was called to the district office for a meeting. Good morning, Mrs. Crawford, we have made a decision to change leaders at Mitchell and therefore, we will not be renewing you. Well I wanna clarify that. I don't think she was non-renewed. She resigned or retired, I think that's more the case. There had been talk of leadership changes at schools throughout the district, though in the end the only changes were the ones at Mitchell, most significant, the forced resignation of Principal Crawford. We not only need our best teachers in schools in this area. We need our best principals, we also need our best district administration, and until they get it right at the district level, the schools and the kids are the ones that are going to be suffering. The top layer of Mitchell will look completely different next year. You know you just look at all the schools and you say, "hmm, which one looks really different than it did?" And it's Mitchell. It's very unsettling to feel like here's this really strong school, people trying to make a difference and we're being asked not to. If we truly had district support, it would be amazing what could happen at this school, but instead of giving us that support they wanted to tear everybody apart. With Mrs. Crawford, Daniela and Reuben gone, Amy found the lack of respect for teachers was more than she was willing to take and decided to leave teaching. I'd like to ask them why. I'd like to sit down, "okay, now that I'm gone, now that I'm leaving, tell me what it is. What happened? What was the big problem?" After the threats of insubordination and her attendance at professional development conferences being cancelled by the district, Daniela decided to leave the Isaac School District. What's that say? Read it. Treat others the way you would like to be treated. Oh that's a good rule, huh? The changes at Mitchell are the result of a top-down management structure that conflicts with a collaborative community of teachers. This is a reality faced in high needs districts and schools that already struggle with high turnover. Time is needed for meaningful change to take root and sustain itself. At Mitchell, lingering is the question of how the destruction from above impacted the potential benefit of momentum that was building over the last two years. As is the reality around the country, these teachers face a new school year with fewer resources and a greater sense of fear of speaking out or stepping up. Of course it was disruptive with them leaving. Yeah, because you have to go back to the beginning and start all over again. I think we definitely shared in the heartfelt absence of both Daniela and Reuben and Mrs. Crawford. A lot of us were just concerned how this year was gonna be with new leadership and some people missing from our leadership team. I think we expected it to be bad because we had it so good over the last couple of years and we had built this family that was so strong and this culture that was so vivacious and just ready to tackle the world. So we were cautiously optimistic at best. For the most part today we're gonna be exploring some perceptual data. Your perceptions about how things went as well as some of the data that the district has provided. The minute that I met our new principal, Dr. Montoya I was immediately put at ease. They just seemed a lot more positive about their own learning and taking control of their own learning because they saw us doing the same thing. We were modeling what we expected from them. The teachers here have not made it difficult for me, even though they went through a difficult process, you know, last year. It truly is a very special staff and that they're very willing to take on new things, new learning. I feel like she really understands the needs of her staff. She's really embraced Mitchell. This year the Mitchell 20's new leaders were confronted by district leadership and were forced to adjust. They saw the birth of three children, felt the impact of budget cuts and state scrutiny of their school. In a community already reeling from the deepening recession and immigration sweeps, these teachers are stepping up and making the most of what they have. Like teachers everywhere, they do what is needed to teach our children. Having submitted in April 2010, Blanca, Reuben, Benito, Chhaya, Shellie, Billie, Kimberly and Amy are all awaiting November to get their results. I knew I just couldn't, I couldn't stop. It just wasn't in me. I felt like I needed to find the silver lining in the cloud, the dark, dark cloud that was not achieving, and I really was able to discover that I had a lot more growing to do. No matter how long it takes me, if I have to become an advanced candidate next year and start all over the following year, it's a journey that I plan on seeing to the end. I think one of the fascinating things about the board is how high a percentage of those who don't pass, which is more than half, go back and try again, and I don't think they are going back and trying again just because they want that piece of paper. I think they also recognize what a marvelous impetus this is to the quality of the work they do. After attempting Take One, and then taking a year off, Laura was inspired to attempt full certification. I took my time thinking about if I wanted to take this challenge on. I looked at Daniela Robles and Tina Chu and I thought, well, you know, they are an inspiration in the case that they didn't stop even if it was hard. They committed to it, and I see their behavior and their attitude positive, always challenging themselves, and having fun in the process, even if it is difficult. And though leaving was tough for Daniela, she has been recruited and hired as an academic achievement coach by a neighboring school district whose leadership embraces the potential of powerful teachers and teacher leaders. So this time you're gonna have to fill in the blank. So partner B, you're going to say, "I enjoyed listening to you because..." When we first heard about the availability of Daniela, we just jumped at the opportunity. At Griffith Elementary School, Daniela's exceeding expectations, building new relationships, and fitting into her new community. What is your favorite thing to do and why? I'm going to give you, hmm, seven seconds to think about that. When you want to bring in change, it's important to kind of develop a critical mass and that's what we're looking for Daniela to do, to be able to come in, to be able to mentor other individuals, to develop a cadre that can create real and lasting change not only in one school but in the entire district. When you build teachers up, when you make them believe in themselves, great things happen. Our class is great, great, great, great. Perfect, okay. We're looking at data all the time, and our data supports that her job and the teachers' work with her is working. When you believe in what you're doing, and you start to realize your colleagues around you believe in what you're doing, then you create that spark and that fire, and before you know it, there are 50 voices that sound just like yours, and so there you have that collective power and that's what changes things. Maybe not immediately but eventually it's what will change things. If what I'm doing is important for the 22 children in my classroom, how do I make it work for the 400 in my school? How do I make it work for the 30,000 in my school district? And ultimately you can say, how do I make it work for the six million kids in secondary schools that are most at risk of dropping out? Throughout Arizona and the country, the story of the Mitchell 20 has spread and is inspiring other schools and teachers to follow their lead. As a result, the perception of National Board Certification as the pursuit of a single teacher has now been changed to something a group or a whole school can do together, having a greater impact on the culture of the school. ♫ So get ready, get ready ♫ Here I come ♫ We have about 95,000 schools in our country, and if every single one of those schools followed Mitchell's example, and entire cohorts of teachers taking that next step in the journey, I think I could retire and go to the Bahamas. My job would be done. The education in this country would be transformed. I think sometimes we define heroes by position or title, and I think heroes are defined by actions. I don't know of another place where a group of teachers just decided to lead the transformation in the school and bring everybody along. That's exciting to me. The Mitchell School story is an amazing example of how we can fundamentally confront and overcome inequality in the society. We have a huge problem with teacher quality in this country, but it's not because of the fact that we don't have enough smart people teaching. The fact is, we don't treat them well enough or we don't support them well enough. ♫ And I'm bringing you a love that's true ♫ So get ready, get ready ♫ I'm gonna try to make you love me too ♫ So get ready, get ready, here I come ♫ Get ready cause here I come ♫ Get ready cause here I come ♫ Oh my gosh It has been a full two years since the Mitchell 20 began their journey, a journey of many challenges and few victories. Today the second set of scores are released at 7 AM. You know what? I did better than the last time, but I don't think I achieved. I knew that when I submitted it. No, I didn't achieve. No, I didn't make it either. ♫ It's your thing ♫ Do what you wanna do ♫ Thank God! Thank God! I'm so happy. I can't even explain how happy I am right now, gosh. Christy? I got my, I got my scores and I'm a National Board Certified Teacher! I did it, I achieved, I did it! Break open the champagne, Dad. Like this weight has lifted off my shoulders. I've been waiting for months for the score. Oh my gosh to see that on that screen. Congratulations! ♫ It's your thing ♫ It's so small though. You're like "I want it bigger!" Yes, we did. ♫ Oh it's your thing ♫ Do what you wanna do ♫ While working at her new job, Amy found out that like Shellie, Chhaya and Tina, she has become a National Board Certified Teacher. A month later, Amy came back to teaching. Hello ladies! - Good morning - Are you ready for your final? Yeah. ♫ It's your thing ♫ Do what you wanna do ♫ Not accomplishing made me realize that I had to sit back and say, "You know what? I appreciate the fact that this isn't coming easy." I'm not one of those teachers you sit and you listen to teachers say, "Well, I accomplished everything the first time." My life has never been first times. I've always had to fight for whatever it is that I accomplished. It was disappointing that I didn't get a bankable score, but it wasn't disappointing because I got so much out of it. I felt like I grew, that I grew through this process. So that, in of itself, is a form of achievement. I am a different person for all the learning processes and reflections that you have to do? Yes, you grow into a different person, and you view things in education in a different way. I am a better teacher because of the process and I'm grateful that I went through it, and I feel everything that I went through has definitely help me be the person and the teacher and the leader that I am today. Two years ago, Linda, Daniela and the Mitchell teachers stepped up to ask more of themselves and their profession. They decided to put action to their desire and bring better practice to their classrooms, and so doing, they brought a spotlight to a type of school that usually rests in the shadows. They made themselves vulnerable and exposed, and much to their surprise, their quest for greater autonomy and empowered teaching touched a nerve. In the face of it all, they became better teachers, more reflective, more collaborative, more confident. They became more effective. Student achievement, attendance, and parent participation are up and making steady growth, and because of the efforts of these teachers, last year Mitchell made AYP and is no longer on warning. Teachers are the key to improving education in America. And if we, the teachers, don't put ourselves out there to be the change agents, then nobody else will. They're the ones in front of our nation's 50 million students every single day. They're the ones who, through their hard work, their blood, their sweat, their tears, their long hours, they're transforming students' lives and giving them an opportunity to be successful. And so teacher leadership, teacher leaders working together have a huge, huge ability to transform our students' lives, and we have to do everything we can to support them, to nurture them and to help them grow and develop, to recognize and reward their success and to learn from them. We did all this for our students. And our students are our number one priority. You know, we're not just here for a paycheck or you know, a summer break. If I'm not in school I feel out of place. We don't work in the perfect school district. If it can work here at Mitchell, it can, it could work anywhere and everywhere else. We are teachers who got tired with complacency. When we get together, we are a strong force. And we made it happen. Teachers all over the country are eager to make it happen, they are eager to lead and own their profession. Unfortunately, teachers do not have a real voice in the system. It will take a big shift to change this reality, and it starts with you, with all of us. By seeing this film you are already part of a movement. With 50% of the film's proceeds going to a scholarship fund for teachers. Your next step? Go to a school board meeting and encourage the school board members to set up a special screening. We all need to donate more. We all need to demand that teachers are driving education policy so that we can deliver a great education for every student. ♫ Get ready ♫ Cause here I come ♫ Get ready cause here I come ♫ We can improve education in America, in every school, in every community if just one person, one teacher, one parent, one leader decides to step up. It takes one person, because I know, because I've lived it. It takes one person to cause a spark that then sets a fire. You can be that spark. You can be that person. And together we can deliver a great education for every student. ♫ Get ready, get ready cause here I come Subtitle by Pedotriba ♫ Never met a girl who makes me feel the way that you do ♫ You're all right ♫ Whenever I'm asked who makes my dreams real, ♫ I say that you do ♫ So, fee-fi-fo-fum ♫ Look out baby cause here I come ♫ And I'm bringing you a love that's true ♫ So get ready, so get ready ♫ I'm gonna try to make you love me too ♫ So get ready so get ready 'cause here I come ♫ Get ready 'cause here I come ♫ Get ready 'cause here I come ♫ If you wanna play hide and seek with love, ♫ Let me remind you ♫ But the lovin' you're gonna miss ♫ and the time it take to find you ♫ So, fiddley-dee, fiddley-dum ♫ Look out baby, 'cause here I come ♫ And I'm bringing you a love that's true ♫ So get ready, so get ready ♫ I'm gonna try to make you love me too ♫ So get ready, so get ready 'cause here I come ♫ Get ready 'cause here I come ♫ Get ready 'cause here I come ♫ If all my friends should want you too, ♫ I'll understand it ♫ I hope I get to you before they do, ♫ The way I planned it ♫ So tiddley-dee, tiddley-dum ♫ Look out baby, 'cause here I come ♫ And I'm bringing you a love that's true ♫ So get ready, so get ready ♫ I'm gonna try to make you love me too ♫ So get ready, so get ready 'cause here I come ♫ Get ready 'cause here I come ♫ Get ready 'cause here I come ♫ Get ready 'cause here I come ♫ Get ready 'cause here I come ♫
