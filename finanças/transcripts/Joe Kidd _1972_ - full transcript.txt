Got some nice breakfast for you, boys. Hey, Joe. Wake up and eat something. You're gonna appear before the Judge. He's stinking drunk. Why'd you put him in here? We don't want him. Gringo son of a bitch, woke us up. He don't give a damn. Hey Joe, you hear me? You're to appear before the judge. - Bob Mitchell hit me? - Yup. - Who else? - And some others. Took three of 'em to get you in here last night. I'll be back for you. Smells good? Gringo, you want some? You say, "Please, Señor Naco." Say it. I want to remind you why we're here. We aren't suing anybody yet. We're here to see if any of you have a legal claim. If you do, then a suit will be filed in court. But I want you to think before you act. I don't know if the land grants you have, signed by the King of Spain or the Emperor of Mexico, are going to stand up against the deeds and titles on file here. I do have other court matters to attend to, so I'm postponing these hearings until tomorrow. I'll let you have time to consider what you're doing. I advise you to use proof before you take legal action that'll set peoples' teeth on edge. - Calvin? - Yo? Gimme Joe Kidd, right now. Come on, Joe. They're waiting on you. Hey, Gringo. Want some? Go ahead, take it. You want some? Calvin, what the Hell's going on? Boy just spilled his breakfast. You shouldn't have hit me, Bob. Next time I'll knock your head off. Let's go see the judge. Your Honour, I got three warrants on Joe Kidd here: Poaching, disorderly, and resisting arrest. Poaching? Witness saw him carrying a buck off Jicarilla Reservation. You arrested a man for shooting a deer? I warned him. - What did you do with this deer? - I ate him. It's against the law to hunt on a reservation. The deer didn't know where he was, and I wasn't sure either. Are you pleading guilty? I'm saying I shot a mule deer in South Emenaro. On the reservation. Last night I told him he had to pay a fine, and he got nasty. - That's the "disorderly" charge? - No, sir. "Disorderly" was something else. What? Well, he stood out there and said he would urinate on the courthouse. You do whatever you feel like, is that it? - Anything else? - Yes. Do you want to pay a 10-dollar fine or spend 10 days in jail? I'll take the 10 days. Your Honour... Court's adjourned until 2 o'clock. You think you can sit in that jail while Calvin waits on you? No, siree. You're gonna paint, scrub floors and work your... I want to inform you people, you're in a US territorial court. We have listened to you enough. Now, now it's our turn. When the Anglo first wished to build a house in Sinola, he asked. And the old people, our grandfathers say, "It's alright. There is enough land. Let the Anglo have a home." Then you build more houses, the railroad, the courthouse. Then we begin to hear you say strange things. Two years ago, we start to see about our land claims. We go to the record office in Santa Fe, and ask for our deeds. You know what they say? "No, we don't have those records any more. There was a fire in the courthouse, and all the records got burnt up." You feel you have a legal claim, with proof... We have heard all that. Ricardo. We let you use our land, but you wish to steal it all. - Look, Mister... - I am Luis Chama. So you're Chama. Well, you're more trouble than you're worth, but I'll still inform you: You're committing an offence before a witness in a court of justice. That is the word: Justice. Later we will have much time to talk about it. What are you staring at? I just want to remember your face, honey, when you come to trial. I'll show you something. Anglos claim they own the land. Big cattle and timber companies. One day, there was a fire... Stay where you are. He's going with us. He'll give us our rights. What do you want him for? Take Mitchell. He's an expert on rights. - Think they'll shoot us? - Maybe. Maybe not. Luis, he's got the judge. - Who's with him? - Joe Kidd. He was in jail. Forget him. Get the judge. I suggest you go right on the back, your Honour. Yeah. Hello, Joe. How'd you make out? I'm not sure yet, Harry. Gringo, you're thirsty? Where is he? Oh, he went home. Your friends are calling you. I guess I better go. I guess so. Maybe we'll see each other in jail again sometime? That's possible. Calvin. Where in Hell you been? They broke those two guys outta jail. I said where in Hell you been? - Where? - In jail. Jesus. Form a posse. Mount up. Git your guns. Jesus... I'll take the posse out, you stay here. Will you try to keep some law and order while I'm gone? Bob, how we gonna find them? Didn't they just leave fresh tracks? There's tracks all over out there. How do we know which are Chama's? He gets up in them mountains, he can stay up there for good. Just a damn minute. I'm not begging you to come. You want to sit on your fat asses when that wild son of a bitch is loose, you don't mind him cutting fences and running your stock... that's Ok. But get out of my way, I'm riding. And I'm going to bring back him or his hide. Joe, what are you doing? Serving 10 days. Bob, you know Joe's the one we need. You want to go? No. I got nothing against Luis Chama. Posse couldn't get him. You think that's gonna work? Joe, you take your broom, that shovel, that rake and that bucket. Go to courthouse square and pick up everything that's not nailed down. - Howdy, Mr Harlan. - Howdy. - To the Grand Hotel. - You bet. Good morning, Mr Harlan. These telegrams came in last night and this morning. One of them, I noticed, all the way from Chicago. Mr Harlan, it's such a pleasure to have you and your friends. It's been how long? 2, 3 months? Time goes so fast. Seems like yesterday. Oh my, no. I'm glad you weren't here yesterday. You heard about the excitement we had. I've reserved the governor's suite for you, and 2 other rooms. Anything else? Mr Harlan? I want the whole second floor. Oh, I have guests... the other rooms... I mean, I don't have extra space anywhere. What should I do? I can't very well tell them to get up and get out, can I? For 10 bucks a head, I'll throw 'em out the window. Just say the rooms are spoken for, and there's nothing you can do. If there's trouble, gimme a holler. Just say the rooms are spoken for. - Send it out for me. - Hello, Mr Harlan. Ma'am. Anything I can do for you? I want to see a man named Joe Kidd. Joe Kidd's in jail. If he weren't, I doubt we'd be talking. You knew he was in jail, huh? I'd like to pay his fine, and I want you to send him over to me. Didn't know he was a friend of yours. Send him on over. Second Floor. Joe, Mr Harlan wants to see you. - Who? - Mr Harlan. Don't know the man. - You know his name? - Never heard it. He knows you, he's paid your fine, and he wants to see you. - Yeah? Where is he? - At the hotel. He's paid my fine, huh? He can't be all bad. - You Joe Kidd? - Yeah. Be with you in a minute. Hey, aren't you going to wait? Well, you sure don't look like you're supposed to. - How am I supposed to look? - You're dressed like a town dude. Were you really leaving? Well, he asked to see me. If he's busy, maybe another time. Oh, you don't know Mr Harlan, do you? You call him that? "Mr Harlan"? I call him "Frank". A few other things. Why? Well, you... don't look like his daughter, I don't think you're his wife. I'm not his mother either. But you do take care of him at times. - Ask him if you like. - Or I'll find out for myself. How long did they have you locked up? Two days. What would you be like after two months? We wouldn't even be talking now. Mr Harlan can see you now. Mr Harlan, Joe Kidd. Kidd, Joe Kidd. I'll say this: You come well recommended. Judge Vince Brennan, spoke very highly of you. A man named Wallace said you worked at the Jicarilla Apache Station, know the mountains and game trails better than anybody. You were supplying their meat. Yeah, I worked for them a few years. I understand you hunted men. Anybody with a price on his head. Good at it. That was a long time ago. Now you got an outfit in Big Wash, you work when you're not out hunting. I get out now and then. We propose to spend a week, maybe 10 days. Pay you your rate, and a bonus for everything we shoot. Get us some mule deer, some elk, maybe a mountain cat if we see one. You think this piece of iron will stop one of them big old cats? Yeah, if you can get close enough. Close enough. Hear that, Mingo? Mr Kidd, meet my associates: Mr Olin Mingo, Lamarr Simms, this is Roy Gannon. These gentlemen are fine hunters, my friend. I bet them against anybody, at any distance. You believe that? If he says so... Whatever he says, that's it. I'll show you something, buddy. Shut the window, Lamarr. We'll need four horses, which we'll buy off you if you want. Come to your place tomorrow evening, and start in the morning. You're asking me to guide for you? What do you think I been talking about all this time? Well, I don't hire out to guide, either for animals or men. You don't believe we're after deer, do you? You're after Luis Chama. Seen through it right away, didn't you? Got a keen eye. It's simple enough. You deal in land, and he wants to take it away. If the sheriff can't stop him, I will, Mister. I got claim to 935 sections, nearly 600,000 acres. And I'm not letting some sheep-herder named Luis Chama cut my fences and stir up the Mexican population with talk about land reform. Nor am I going to waste time arguing in court. Now here it is: I'll give you 500 dollars to help us track that man. If it's your shot that gets him, it's alright with me. 500 dollars. What do you say? I already said it. Wait a minute, sir. I paid a fine on you. Got you out of jail. If you want your 10 dollars back, I'll sit out the rest of the time. He's going on a hunting trip. I'll be back. Emilio? Vita? Joseph. Señor Emilio, they take him. They take horses too. - When did it happen? Where? - This morning. Emilio say, "stay home," and they take him. Up there. Joseph, where you been? Chama do this? He and his men took some horses and shot the rest. One say you killed his friend. He say he's gonna kill you too. Where are you going? Come in. You want Luis Chama? Got thinking about the money, did you? Do you want him? I told you: 500, and I don't care who shoots him. The price'll be a thousand. Alright. Anything else? No. Meet you downstairs. Want something? You know how many holes I could put in you with this gun? Lamarr, I got a dollar that says I can break your neck before you shoot. Yeah. Mr Harlan wants you around. That's why I don't plug you right now. When Mr Harlan doesn't want me around any more, you let me know. Huh, boy? We might get lucky and find him sitting home waiting on us, Mingo. Yeah: "For a dumb-ass sheep-dipper, you sure been bothering us. Causing all kinds of discomfort." There's a road west of here. We could save time. Game doesn't walk down roads. We're supposed to be hunting deer. If we see somebody here, which don't seem likely, does it? Well, we've had company for about a mile. Where at? Both sides of us. I don't see a thing. How many? Three, maybe more. - What's going on? - Shut up. We got people going with us, maybe Chama. I don't see anybody. - I see 'em, Frank. - What are you saying? I could wing one of those fellows, if you wanted to talk to him. They're showing themselves. They don't give a darn. They know they got us outnumbered. Nice looking string you have there. Still green. They'll be alright. You rope 'em? Yeah. We chased them three or four days. You haven't, by chance, see any elk around? No. Some deer. You out hunting? You haven't been home for a while? No, not for a few days. You want some game? Go into San Juan. You might get a bear. My friend, I'll ask a question, and I want to ask it only once: Where's Luis Chama? Luis Chama? Yeah, I saw him some time. You looking for him? We got to go. If I see Luis Chama, I'll tell him you're asking for him. Mingo, I want him alive. I got him in the arm. I was aiming for his shoulder, but he jumped. You say you saw Luis Chama where? I don't know anybody by that name. We can cut your ears off. I don't know him. We can cut something else off too. He says, "Say anything. Why get chopped up?" Chico, the only way you're going to live is if you answer me. Understand? The question is: Where's Luis Chama? I don't know him. Lamarr. I came here to hunt Chama, not kill people in cold blood. I told you, I don't have time for court hearings. If they want to fight me, I'll blow 'em straight to Hell. Anybody home? Hello. Well, look what I have found. Evening. Honey, I want to ask you something. You know a man named Luis Chama? I know him. - You see him lately? - No. When? - About a week ago. - Are you a friend of his? I see him when he goes by here. Like on his way to Arroyo Blanco? - You know where that is. - Over the pass. He isn't there. Well Honey, we're friends of his. If he's around, we want to say hello. Is that why you have all those guns? This is a hunting trip. You gotta have guns. Ask why she has so many guns. Huh? They're from my father and brother. Where are they? Looking for work. I don't know when they come back. They leave you by yourself? I don't mind being alone a few days. Pretty girl like you shouldn't be left alone. Maybe we'll camp here tonight, if she invites us. - What's your name, Honey? - Helen Sanchez. Helen, what would you think if we stayed here with you tonight? I think you're going to do whatever you want. They'd like some more coffee. - Have you told them yet? - Nope. Why not? I think it's none of there business. But you are with them. Let's say I made a poor judgement, but I'm gonna have to live with it. When I was in jail in town, there was a man named Naco? - He died two days ago. - He shouldn't have come at me. But you want Chama. Everybody wants Chama. He'll either get shot or hanged. Some people will give their lives for what they believe. You understand. I guess so, if they want something enough. No. Even if there's no chance, but to do it for others. Like a soldier gives his life. You don't know Luis Chama. Maybe you've never met anybody like him. Maybe not. Were you with him when he came to my place? Yes, I was there. You want to kill me too? There was a man named Emilio with my horses. I remember him. Ramón went back to see if he was following us. Ramón, huh? Next stop: Bandera Station. - Nothing there but stock pens. - Wanna bet? - Mr Harlan, where you been? - Resting from my train ride. - Thought you'd be here waiting. - We're here now, Eljay. Let's go. We're ready. All those guns to kill one man. Yeah, if they find him. They're all hiding. Call everybody out into the street. Alright, everybody out. Out in the street. Hold your fire. They're way up in those rocks. Chama. You hit one of my men, I'll kill 10 of your people. Morning, Padre. I want you to call your people out. We're holding services in the street. Bring them out. Out in the street. Roy? Now, I don't want to take up your time. I just want to say, we're gonna shoot five of you, if Luis Chama don't come down off his mountain by sun-up tomorrow. If he don't show by noon, we shoot five more. If he still don't show up by supper, we put five more against the wall. Now, the next day if we have to, we start all over again. Son... - You have a horse? - Yes. Get on your horse, go upstairs and ask Luis Chama if he heard what I said. - Understand? - Yes, Señor. Padre, get 'em all inside the church. Repeat everything, in case some of 'em "Americans" didn't understand. Stake out your men, Eljay. Keep the horses saddled. Me and the little girl sleep here. Kidd, you're fired. Take his gun, Mingo. Put him in the church. Look at him. Without his gun, he looks like a big, dumb farm boy. Go ahead, farm boy. Take your pick. I know it's a crappy deal, buddy. But that's all you got. What's the matter, run out of nerve? Go ahead. Grab. Because I'm gonna blow your head off. I said make a grab. Jesus, that boy don't ever learn. Well, the fun's over and he's gone to church. Are you thirsty? - Yeah. What do you have there? - Holy water. I've had just about everything else, might as well have some holy water. Today is the feast of Saint James the Apostle, one of the first martyrs. I will tell the people: Pray to him, for his strength. He was beheaded, rather than deny his faith. You wouldn't have a gun around here, Padre? Good time of day, Eljay. Day's work is done, a man's waiting on a good supper. Open the door, Ming. - You going to feed these people? - Feed them. Roy, let him get these people some food. Hey, Lamarr, how you feeling? That medicine easing the pain? You just keep talking. You'll be spitting teeth all night. A high-priced waiter you got, Roy. - You gonna eat all that? - It's for the glutton outside. How's he treating you? We're getting married, what do you think? He wouldn't have a loaded gun around here, would he? Don't do anything foolish. Wait for Luis. The boy they sent seems to be having trouble finding his way back. He's probably still hunting for Chama. Think so? Luis is up there. He knows and he'll come. With a gun, without one, but he'll come. I certainly hope so. If he doesn't, it'll disappoint an awful lot of people. If you don't blink soon, your eyeballs will fall out. Hey. How about somebody else coming up here for a while? You want to take that, Lamarr? Why not. Come on, Lamarr. Get up here. When this is over, we finish it. From the table they put the guns on. I don't even know if it fires. Don't worry, it fires. I have lived with my people 33 years. This morning I can't look in their faces. I can't bless five of them and send them outside. Well, Padre... we'll see. He's dead. I believe you. Send up his gun and his hat. Lamarr, don't fall asleep up there. Go screw yourself. That sweet boy's either asleep or he's fallen off the tower. Oh, let him alone. He's had a bad night. Ok, get five of them out. Come on. I want Chama to see the facts of life staring him in the face. Roy, Mingo. Get outta the field, get your rifles and do some good. Come on. There they are, Chama. You coming down now? Chama, you got one minute. Now, that's not much of a shot for you is it, Mingo? - Where do I hit them? - I'll pick a spot. First man: Second button. For six bits, if you hit the button. For six bits, I'll hit the second button on both men. Jesus... Mingo. Shoot two right now. - How you doing? - Don't touch it. You would have let them kill those people. I'm going to tell you something. Listen, and try to understand. If our people are killed for what we are doing, they will become names. They will live forever. Martyrs? I think we have enough of them. Then why do you want me to become one? Listen: We only win if I stay alive. If those men kill me now, who will take my place? Understand? - You'd let people die for you. - For what they believe. They believe in you. I am telling you how it is. - There is no other way. - I know another way. Come with me back to Sinola, give yourself up and stand trial. Stay out of it. You brought me into it by stealing my horses. You killed one of our men. You help her, now we're even. Go home, while you can. He's right. We must give ourselves up. Don't you see? There's no other way. I don't care what you think. I take you along for cold nights, and days when there's nothing to do, not to hear you talk. Harlan. You want Chama? You can find him in Sinola Jail. Let's mount up. Just like that, huh? Straight up or draped over the saddle. Either one. And my men? I don't care about them. They can come or stay, whatever pleases them. Listen to this Anglo son of a bitch. Luis. Say it. We throw him off the cliff. Ramón. Alright. This isn't the time. We'll settle this later. - Train stop here, Mr Harlan? - It'll stop, Eljay. Hold your fire. They're way out of range. We'll be eleven. - Hi. - Hey, little girl. Let a person get a chance to breathe. You'll breathe so you can't stop. - Did you miss me? - Of course I did. Stay right here in the room, like I told you? Sure did. Mr Harlan. Ma'am. How was your hunting trip? - Mitchell, how you been? - Just fine. Somebody will bring Luis Chama in tomorrow. Hand him over to me. - What did you say? - Hand him over to me. There's no way... - Take time off and get drunk. - Mr Harlan... Tomorrow's Sunday. Pray we don't meet again until this is done. Little girl, find some whiskey and pour me a drink. Morning. - Let's open up. - We're Closed. You're open. We're open. Alright. I say Chama goes to jail and pleads his case. What do you say? Not you, Ramón. Ramón. Lead on. I figured we might be too close. Come on in, Kidd. Nobody's going to hurt you. Hey, Kidd. Bring Chama over here. Come on in, Kidd. Mitchell. Got a prisoner for you. Jesus, Joe. Here. Give me some cover. Start with the hotel. Bob. Get outta here. Good luck, huh? Well, that settles that. Anything I can do for you? Come on. Joe, you shouldn't have done that. Next time, I'll knock your damned head off.
