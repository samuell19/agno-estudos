"How I regret the passing of spring." ASANO CLAN The time to avenge our late Lord Takumi-no-Kami Naganori is here. Let us kill Lord Kira! Former councilor, Oishi Kuranosuke, left his leisure life in Yamashina for the East with Ishioda, Chikamatsu, Sugaya, Hayami, and others. It is October 7, 1702. 11 MILES TO EDO He is here. Sir Oishi, Hara Soemon is here to greet us. Soemon, I thank you for coming. You there... I believe you are Maeda Heinai. During the days I was partying at Gion-machi, you accompanied the Uesugi's chief retainer Chisaka Hyobu As one of his agents with Sarubashi Umon. What a strange place to meet up again at. Wait! Takebayashi Tadashichi has killed him. I'm to blame for hiring him without knowing he was a Uesugi spy. Don't worry about him. A man of Chisaka's caliber would have many plots. There is no way he would not know of my entering Edo. The match begins now. Shuzaemon, how are the Edo comrades' movements? Onodera Junai uses the alias Jubei and poses as the owner Of a saké store called Nanba-ya in Honįo. Kanzaki Yogoro uses the name Yosichi and works for him along with Katsuta Shinzaemon as Shinkichi. Thank you for waiting. Next, Hazama Gihei is a clothing dealer called Mimasaka-ya in Honįo Aoi-cho. Here, Hazama Jiįiro and Shinroku, Muramatsu Sandaiyu, and Okano Kinemon work for him. I will leave now for delivery. Yokogawa Kanpei is a fish vendor. Kurahashi Densuke is a greengrocer. Okuda Magodayu is a fortuneteller. Amongst them in pity is Horibe Yasubei... What happened? Horibe is known in Edo for getting into fights. Thinking he'd be a hindrance as a spy, he purposely poured boiling water on his face... Rokusuke, it's been a while since I've seen you. I was at Matsura's mansion, but have been unlucky. It's been so gloomy, I can't show my face anywhere. I feel awkward coming here... But in this cold, I'm in a helpless condition. Please let me have one drink. I've įust returned. Aren't you Sugino Juheiįi? What is with that attire? He was born clumsy. He is useless even in martial arts. So I made him try to become a soba vendor, but the taste is... I thought he was good in boiled side dishes and seasoning. Who said it was bad? This is good. You should try some. You'll do really good with this. It will be a hit. Thank you. Young master... I mean the sensei of Muruya. What is it? - There is a soba stall. Won't you buy us all a bowl of noodles to warm us up? That is great! Give us five bowls! It's great to accompany you! I don't mind accompanying you, but Genba-sensei has no mercy. Every time he strikes me, fire comes out of my eyes and I faint. True, but when she helps you up, you feel better right away. There is a girl who works like a stimulant. She is the younger sister of Tawaraboshi Genba, a spear instructor and her name is Tae. We go there įust to see her face. She may be great, but Genba is a drunkard crank. We pay high recompense fee and get beaten up. How ridiculous is that? Tae... Tae, where are you? Noodle vendor, I call for you. Come in from the front. Thank you for your patronage. TAWARABOSHI GENBA Vendor, why do you lie? Lie? You just said thank you for your patronage. This is your first time here. I wasn't lying. I was just being polite as a businessman. Flattery?! That is just it! Because you go around saying compliments, it has affected the samurai and now they curry favor with their superiors and are absorbed in only flattery. What a shame! Thank you for waiting. What is this? It's soba. I don't want any! - What? I didn't order it. When I was passing by, you said, I call for you. I said that, but I didn't mean I wanted soba. I see what they mean... He is a crank. What did you just say? I said is that right? You lied again. You called me a crank! His hearing is good. So what do you want? I'd like some water to get sober. Don't you have any? - I do... But you have some at your home. But I really want drink your water. You just don't want to get it yourself. Here is your water. Delicious! Enough with the compliments. Now return my bowl. Compliments? How rude! I, Tawarboshi Genba, do not give out flattery! Because I cannot do that, my only sister has to... Do you have saké? I have a little, but... You do? Will you let me have some? Sure. For a night vendor, you have good saké. This is not flattery. Give me those noodles from earlier. What? You said you didn't want any. Silence! After my drink I feel hungry now. This is good! That is flattery. Come back tomorrow for your money. Wait a minute. You're being unreasonable. Why is that? - That is right! I live day by day. You lure me in by saying,"I call for you." Then you ask for water, saké and ate the soba you first rejected. And now you won't pay? What?! I didn't say I wouldn't pay. - Then pay me. I don't have the money now. And my sister is not here. Even is she were here, there is no guarantee you have the money. I have you read. You're a liar! I won't forgive you for calling me a liar! Go home! Fire does come out of your eyes... Brother, what are you doing? I may be drunk, but it doesn't alter my skill. He was just frightened out of his wits. Hang in there. She is a stimulant. I feel much better. That hurts. Are you all right? I'm fine. You need not so that, you will dirty your hand. He is such a crank, so I got mad. If you're too nice to me... I'm afraid of Genba-sensei, so I'll leave now. Excuse me... His bill? I'll come by tomorrow. I still won't have it... I'll come by some day. No... Take this. It's my late mother's. It's not worth that much, but it'll cover your bill. You should keep that memento. Please take it. Well... I'll hold on to it. Forgive my brother. Don't be silly. It must be hard for you. He is a good man... He is just lonely. Excuse me. Noodles... I'll have a bowl. I'm done for the day. - Don't give me that. You just said,"noodles." I'm not in the mood to work now! I want to eat soba! What?! Don't get rough! All right, I'll make it. When did you start your business? I haven't seen you around before. This is terrible! Terrible? I've never had such bad soba! What? This is terrible. Here. I don't have any money on me. When I see you the next time, I'll pay. Wait there! If you had no money, why did you order? I ate it because I have no money. If I did, why would I eat such bad noodles? Silence! Enough of your offensive remarks! Say it again and I won't forgive you! You're some soba-ya Sugino, it's me. You are Horibe? Not too loud. Why did you do this? The old man told me you were here, so I came here worried about you. As expected, your speech was a dead giveaway. What if I were a Kira servant? I'm sorry. Juheiji, Sir Oishi left for the East. Our day will be soon. That is why we must be extra cautious. Do you understand now? If you do, then make me another bowl. It was really good. Tawaraboshi did that? You know him, then. I've never met him. He was a vassal for the Bishu clan, and is well known for using the Mugen-ryu spear. I didn't realize he was master-less. It's too bad for him. Is that right? There must be a reason. Here you go. Thank you for loaning me the five ryo. Master, the madam of Matsuno-ya is waiting in the other room. Thank you for coming by. Who was that man who just walked by? His name is Heiji, one of my clerks. Did he do something offensive? Nothing like that. Because you didn't like something, You threw away your 300-koku stipend and became a ronin. It may be all right for you to be selfish, but what happens to your younger sister? She is trying to make ends meet with the sewing jobs I find for her. You may be earning some money by taking in students. But you drink up all of your earnings and even hers. Don't say that. He may scold me, but I am going to say my piece. Do you realize the hardship she goes through to buy rice? Have you thought about that even once? If she were not here, you would have starved a long time ago. Are you listening? Please stop! I feel sorry for her. Do you know how old she is? At this rate, I won't be able to die in peace. Excuse me. This is soy sauce... And this is his favorite barrel of saké. What is going on? Well... Last night, she... He mentioned he wanted to learn fencing from you. So as his admission fee, he brought these, right? Yes... Is that right? That was considerate of you. The goal of training is not only to become strong... It's to shape up the manliness and troubled mind. It should be the same for a soba-ya, too. Come with me to the fencing hall. Help me out. Please, just for a while. - But... Brother, please don't be too rough on him. He has never held a spear before. I know that. Do I really have to go through this? Take your position. He didn't strike you yet. Who is this woman who fell in love with Sugino? She is from the country and her name is Oran. She is young but has her own restaurant in Yanagibashi. Even on Ako, Juheiji was always popular with the matured women in the gay world. The reason why we take good care of her is because Kira has taken a liking to her. If she should ever have to provide him bed service, then Juheiji could take advantage of that. I see. Whenever she goes to Kira's mansion, that will mean he is definitely at home. Juheiji may talk sense and act like it, but he is a man of strict morals. So he wouldn't be able to do that. You need not worry about that. It's a great honor for him. If you tell him it will really help us, he will be the lady killer. Besides, I was reluctant to have him join us. Although an underling, a samurai should know martial arts. On the day of the raid, he will just be a burden. That is what I told Oishi. Takebayashi! That is going too far! Can you kill even one of Kira's men? When it comes to martial arts, what you said is true... And? But come time for the raid... I'll be killed and stabbed... If someone can kill the enemy during that time, I'd gladly die. But to be used by Kira's woman... I won't be able to die in peace! Thank you for this morning. Why miss... I'll return this to you. What is it? The money you left this morning. What are you saying? It's the money from your hairpin. I tried to sell that before. I couldn't even get a barrel of the soy sauce you brought today. It all depends on who you sell it to. The buyer just happened to be looking for something like it. I have a favor to ask you. What is it? I went along with you this morning and put on an act to become a student. But now I really want to learn from him. Something happened today that made me realize how I wish I knew the martial arts. What happened? It was just a fight amongst friends. Still, if only I was a little more skilled... I'm so mortified. Isn't Otae here yet? Sensei, you've started drinking already. Can we have some? Go home. No practice today? My spear skill is not a plaything for you men. Now leave. But without our master's fee, how will you earn a living? How rude! I said leave! And don't ever return! If you won't leave... Then I'll... I'm back. What is wrong? Heiji, come on in. Sensei, good evening. Why, it's Heiji, the night vendor. Brother, Heiji would seriously like to learn from you. Will you please teach him? I am asking on his behalf, too. Until now, you didn't want me to accept any townsmen. And after what I saw this morning... Sensei, please! Very well then. This is how you hold a spear. Now come at me! Again! Come! Heiji! Heiji, practice is over. You were so hard on him that he is crying. Soba-ya, come here. Would you like a drink? You brought it. You weren't a townsman before. And this is not the first time you're learning. You were really bad, so the instructor gave up on you. Forgive me. I can't fool an expert like you. You're exactly right. There is more. You're seeking a vendetta. Your skill and spirit are too different. I sense desperation. I shouldn't have kept a secret from you. Please don't ask me my former lord's name. I am the son of a foot soldier of a certain clan in the west. My older brother and I came to Edo to seek revenge. My brother knows the Jigen-ryu, but I am what you see. When we get into a fight, I'm to throw myself at the enemy and get stabbed, while my brother kills him. But now, I want to at least get a stab at the enemy before I die... The reason I asked you over today... I was able to obtain the map of Kira's mansion. You got it? Okado Kinemon got it after much hardship. I thank you, too. I am honored. This is the front gate of the Kira mansion. KIRA KIRA Soba-ya, this is very good. Soba-ya, this is very good. The soup and seasoning is very good. I am glad you like it. I just started my business, so I need to build my customers before making money. Please patronize me. We have to keep watch all night. In this cold, we need to eat something hot. Stop by whenever you're nearby. Thank you. Whenever it gets cold, I drink this to help me. It may not be great quality saké, but you may have some. I'll take it. I'll give it right back. Take your time. I have a favor to ask of you. What is it? When it gets cold, everywhere closes their doors early. I'm having a hard time fetching water. I don't have much water left with me. Will you let me take some of the mansion's water? From the mansion? - Yes. They have become strict about who we can let into the mansion. You need to have a pass to go in. It should be all right for a bucket of water. Everyone is asleep now, so no one will see him. You're right. More? In the back, there is a row of residences. The well is there, so hurry and get it. Be careful no one sees you. Okay. Splendid! The sword is a "Kunimitsu," the swordsman is Waku Handaiyu. It has to cut well. This... Who is there? Check it out. Oran. Is something wrong? Anyone suspicious? No. - Okay. He didn't come by today. Who? Heiji. Oh, the soba-ya. You were so rough on him, I'm worried he may have quit. Are you that worried about him? Why, of course... He is trying to avenge his parents' death. He won't survive. Why do you say that? As he said, he'll get killed and his brother will kill the enemy. He'll be all right. He won't get killed. You must assist him. Me, assist him? He is your student. I have to assist my student's vendetta? I have no reason to do so. If it were more than a teacher-student relationship, like a teacher and son-in-law, then I will have to assist. I didn't mean that... Did I read wrong? You're so mean. It took half of my lifetime to master the secret of spear fighting. To die in obscurity is truly unbearable... That is how much I believed in my skill and resented those that did not acknowledge me. I cursed my misfortune and became the cynic I am. I want a good disciple to pass on my spear skills. Taken up with that deep attachment, I wasn't attentive to my only sister's happiness. What a stupid story. You've continued to suffer because of me, and can't even dress up at your age. The kimonos you want to wear... You can only sew them for others. Brother. I don't care about the kimonos... Your foolish brother only thought about his spear skills. And my only younger sister... My dear younger sister... It was my shortcoming to not see how important it was for a man to make you happy. Brother...! Tae, be happy. Are you a scarecrow? If you just stand there, you won't improve! Come at me! Stand! You won't get your revenge like that! Now get up! Stand! A slow-witted man like you needs to practice 100 times harder! You can't give up yet! Now stand up! With the new year, Kira will move from Matsuzaka to the Uesugi mansion and it was approved that he will spend his retirement days there. Kira has been spending most of his days at the Uesugi's. The tea ceremony on the 6th that Otaka found out about will probably fall through. It must be Chisaka Hyobu's doing after discovering that Oishi left. If he moves, we'll be left with just two opportunities. You mean, we still have two more chances. He won't be staying with the Uesugi all the time. Kozukenosuke will surely stay at his mansion in Matsuzaka. Let us devote our efforts to find out when. Oran will be the key. The one that likes Juheiji? If only Sugino would do the job. Unfortunately, Juheiji fell in love. What? Of all things! We've had men leave the group because of their woman. Will Sugino be one of them? You need not be concerned about that. He considers the day of the raid as his death day. His way of showing his love for her is to die undefiled. I really appreciate your feelings. Heiji... But I can't change my fate. My life is only until the day of the vendetta. Don't worry, my brother will assist you. That is... That is... I have to go. Heiji! You say that because you don't like me. That is not it! I... What is wrong? The couple on the riverbed acting close must have bothered her. Be quiet! Lover boy! Hey, soba-ya! I need to talk to you. Come with me. Yasubei, I understand what you're saying. Then will you go to Matsuno-ya? You may scorn me for being a coward, but... Please give me one night. I need time to think about it tonight. Madam, Master Mimasaka is here. Is he alone? No, he is with a young clerk. I see. Show them in. If Heiji doesn't want to come, then just tell me so. That is not true... You can't fool me. He has a woman. No, he is a man of strict morals. That is enough. I saw them together. I saw him meeting a woman. What is wrong? Why am I so bewildered? I don't understand it. Excuse me. Heiji, welcome. I have good news. Come on in. Hello sensei. My brother has been offered employment. Employment? Come on in. I am happy for you. Congratulations. I don't know if this is auspicious or not, but at least I'll be able to buy Tae a kimono for New Years. Have a drink. He'll receive a 200-koku stipend. 200?! Which clan will you be working for? That is just it... I'm not too keen about it. So I've asked for one night to think about it. The man who came here is Uesugi vassal Surubashi Umon. My job will be to guard the Kira mansion. I'm sorry. Someone like me wouldn't understand the situation, but if the opportunity comes to you... Then I should grab it? It is 200-koku, right miss? I don't understand what is bothering him, too. Then I will explain. Last March, Lord Asano Takumi-no-kami injured Lord Kira Kozukenosuke in the castle's Corridor of Great Pines. As a result, the Asano clan was abolished, and Lord Asano Naganori committed suicide. I've heard about that. The injured Lord Kira was not punished at all. There were various criticisms regarding that sentence. I'm sure the Ako ronin will not remain quiet. The Ako clan has the talented Oishi Kuranosuke. Along with many loyal vassals. I am positive they will try to kill Lord Kira and avenge their lord's death, while appealing the unfair judgement. Rumor has it that Oishi is indulged in the gay quarters and has no intention of taking revenge. But the Uesugi's chief retainer Chisaka Hyobu thinks he will. That is why he is gathering skilled men. If I were to accept and be one of Kira's guards... I'd have to fight the Ako men. I may sound like I'm talking big... But if I stand outside of Kira's mansion with my spear... I won't allow that many of the Ako men through. Even though I've hit rock bottom in poverty, my spear which I've prided on being unrivaled... It's truly unbearable to disgrace my skill for this... Brother, if you're doing this for my sake, I'm happy with how things are. Let us practice. Sensei, that is a real spear! This is what Denkuro Michinaga trained with. Face the butt end toward me. Why did you do that? When you attack your enemy, I'll show you how to fight when you storm in. You won't always see your enemy outside. Heiji, watch carefully. It's called the Mugen-ryu "tatami-gaeshi" (flipping the mat). When the enemy comes attacking you from the back, you must first flip the mats to put him in disorder. During that time you charge forward and stab. When you're outnumbered use it to gain advantage. Try it. Again! Again! Stand. Stand! Brother! Stand, Heiji! Stand! Brother! Heiji, if you can't even do this, how can you take revenge? Stand! Please stop! You'll kill him! Heiji... Who is watching the Uesugi mansion? We're keeping a constant watch all night. Warm sweet saké! Warm sweet saké! I'll take one. - Okay. Sugino would like to see Oishi. Send him in. I, Juheiji, will go to Matsuno-ya. You've made up your mind? I am helpless, and realize I can't help in any other way. This duty is unbecoming to a samurai's honor. I sympathize with your feelings. However, when it comes to loyalty, you are not inferior to us at all. Thank you for those words. There is one other thing I'd like to inform you of. Chisaka Hyobu has approached Tawaraboshi Genba. As on of Kira's guards? - Yes! Brother, your saké. I've had enough. Tae, will you fix the hall mats? - Yes. We'll be having visitors. The Uesugi's messenger? I wonder about that. Excuse me. - Coming. I am a vassal of Kaga Tsunahiro. If Tawaraboshi Genba is home, we would like to see him. Please wait here. Brother... Send them in. - Yes. Come on in. Excuse yourself and go out to the garden. I am Tawaraboshi Genba. I am Okumura Kageyu, Maeda Tsunahiro's vassal. Pleased to meet you. My lord has idolized your high reputation, and would like to welcome you as our clan's spear instructor. I am here to seek your acceptance. Did you say you are a vassal of Maeda Tsunahiro? That is right. I am Okumura Kageyu, the steward. To have that much trust... I am satisfied as a samurai. I will turn down the other clan's offer. What, you are accepting? I will never disobey you. Genba, thank you! I will be able to accomplish my mission. I will forever remember this! Thank you very much. Did the guests leave? Tae, you'll have to give up on Heiji. I am happy. It's like a dream. Hold me... Heiji, do you love me even a little? Yes, I do. You will come and see me frequently? I will... But... - But? When you go up to the Kira mansion, you'll let me know ahead of time, right? I'll tell you about that day in this room. "14th" Madam, what is wrong? I lost... Either he was pathetic or I was despicable. I don't know what happened, but I gave him up... And let him go untouched. I even informed him of the day Kira is staying at Matsuzaka. I know his identity, yet why did I do that... Perhaps deep inside, I despise Kira... Or perhaps I wanted my once in a lifetime love to remain pure... I am such a stupid woman. December 14, 1702... It snowed heavily from morning. Excuse me. It's Heiji. I have something for you from Genba. The spear that he cut the butt off of is now ready, so he is giving it to you. Where did they go? To visit a shrine and pray, in this snow. Nanba-ya, thank you for coming. Please go upstairs. Please, allow me. Welcome, please go upstairs. Welcome. There is no point in staying up late. Let us get some rest. When raiding Kira's mansion there is no depth to this merit. The one who gets Kira's head or stands guard are seen as equal. There will be no quarrels before or after. Therefore, even if a member has a displeased motive, we will help one another out of danger to attain victory. If we kill Kira, each of you may not evade punishment. If that happens, we may all be separated. Tae, go to sleep. The drum...! They're doing it! Brother, where are you going? Pray for Heiji's success in battle! Oishi Kuranosuke! It's Tawaraboshi Genba. I wanted to see you, so I am here now. Genba, I apologize for deceiving you the other day. No explanations necessary. Is Heiji in there? He is already in the mansion and fighting. I'm glad to hear that. I would like to assist you, but I am not in a position to. Therefore, I will head to Ryogoku Bridge, and fight the Uesugi should they try to send men over. Pardon me! Waku Handaiyu will take you on. Sugino, he is strong. Let me fight him. Sugino, where did you learn that technique? I did it... I did it... Sensei, I did it! Sensei, I did it! I did it! I gather you are from the Uesugi mansion. I am Tawaraboshi Genba, a ronin. For friendship’s sake, I am siding with the Ako ronin who are raiding Kira's mansion tonight. No one is allowed to cross the bridge. If you insist, I must fight you! As you wish! Kill him! Retreat! Chief retainer Chisaka has ordered that no one is to act on their own. What if you harm the Uesugi clan? Withdraw! Sir Tawaraboshi, it must be fate that we met this way. I agree. Let's go. He fought valiantly. Thank you very much. I shall leave now. Sensei, I flipped the mats! I assumed so when Oishi mentioned your great work. Miss... Please call me Tae. Tae, thank you. Juheiji... Farewell. Yasubei, laugh at me... I'm not behaving like a samurai. You've done your duty. You are free to cry or laugh. You cry your heart out and I will laugh out loud. My spear lives on in Juheiji. But for you... My happiness is on his forehead.
