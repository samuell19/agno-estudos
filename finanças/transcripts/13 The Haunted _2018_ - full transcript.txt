(373 Senior High School) Say "yes" if you're here. Say "yes" if you're here. (Klara, "The Jackal" Vlogger) What's your name? Tasya. (Joy, "The Jackal" Vlogger) Were you a student of this school? Do you remember how you died? Tasya. Right now, in this room, where exactly are you? "Above." =13 The Haunted= Good life! Guys, do the toast again. -What did you say? -My angle was bad. Do it again. Just focus your camera on me. (Quincy, "Miss Cool Wannabe") I bet you will get a great shot. That's right. -Come on. Again. -Cheers. -Hi! -Come on. What to do? (Hana, "Miss Scaredy Cat", Rama's Sister) I spilled the drink. Help me, Rama. What if Mom is mad at me? Hana, just use my handkerchief. Garin! Did you just fart? Oh my God. It stinks. Really stinks. Crazy! (Garin, "The Fart Boy") Sorry, guys. You're so hopeless, Garin. Yo, what's up, guys? Put your hands up! What is that witch doing here? (Fira, "Miss Nagging") And with the wrong dress code on? Who wears black to a party anyway? Celsi, I think your boyfriend still hasn't moved on from Klara. Fira, the fact is, (Celsi, "Miss Fact") if he hasn't, why would he date me? Besides, Klara is nothing compared to me. What's going on? What is it? -Damn Joy! -Why, babe? Why? You still ask me why? Come on, babe. They're such social climbers. They were so proud and just stood there as if he's the king of the year. Ridiculous vlog. Try and play with ghosts. It's just Joy's cheesy trick. Well, babe. The fact is, everybody loves that social climber. Because they can make something that can easily become a big hit. -Or maybe... -Or what? Are you still jealous to see Joy with Klara? Klara? Seriously, babe? Who do they think they are? I just don't like it, some people out of our league... came to our private party only to ruin it. Then they put some ear to ear grin... as if they just came up with a brilliant idea. That's a big bullshit. You can destroy them. You can do something bigger. Another bigger bullshit. I know you can do it, babe. Like what? Let's make a vlog to compete with The Jackal. -Vlog? -Vlog? You mean the one with the camera and we should say, -"Hi, guys. Now we're.." -"Hi, guys." Why are you laughing? Will you listen to me? Guys. Guys! I've been thinking about it last night. Please listen to me. People love supernatural things. Do you know what makes The Jackal popular? Because they make horror theme vlogs. They posted a review about the sighting in the old factory. They got 1,300,000 views... within five days. Guys. I can feel that I'm not just with Klara here. Klara, come on. I can't do it. -Klara, we have to keep moving. -I can't, Joy. -Why? -Come here. Come here, quick. What's the matter? See it through your camera. Hurry. What do you think? Garin, even an elementary school kid can do that. Right? We can make something two times better than that. Even better. -There's more. Hold on -Do you have anything scarier? It's about a female ghost in 373 Senior High School. Where? Here. They got 1,700,000 views. Only in four days. But what if we look up and there's a ghost there? Of course it will fall. We have gravity. -But it's creepy. -Scaredy cat. Don't worry, Hana. I'm here, the future famous director. I even take care of my camera, let alone you. Sweet talker. You mean it? Garin, it stinks! Oh my God! Sorry, guys. My name is Rama. But my friends call me Mr. Perfect. Because I'm always awesome. These are my best friends. And this is my first vlog. This is insane. Have we really lost to The Jackal? We haven't just lost, but mission totally failed. But how could we lose? -We are way cooler compared to them. -Of course we are. -The Jackal is a loser. -Tell me about it. Is it possible that they buy views? -That's impossible. -That's very possible. They got so many views in such a short time. It makes sense. Who are they actually? Joy is just a broke guy who dates Klara for her money. I'm sure it was Klara who bought the camera they use for vlogging. Whatever. They can use Klara's camera or whatever. But they make us look like losers. -Well, the fact is... -Stop with "the fact", babe. Come on. Hey, why not? The fact is, they knocked down our vlog because of their horror vlog. Like it or not, if we want to beat them, we should follow Garin's idea. -This fart boy? -Yes. He came up with the vlog idea. -And what did we get? Totally failed. -Because you didn't listen to me. I told you we had to discuss about our vlog. But none of you listened to me. -Only Celsi did. -When did you say that? Listen. We have to make a "Horror Vlog Reality Show". We find the most haunted place and make a vlog there. I'm sure it will be a big hit. We will get lots of views. Okay? Guys. Hello? Why aren't you listening? Hello, guys. Attention, please. I told you, we have to make a "Horror Vlog Reality Show". We go to the scariest place and make a vlog. It will go viral. But you were busy. To summon a ghost is easy. -Just do this. -Setan (ghost)! Right. You can laugh. But from the beginning, I agree with Garin's idea. Well, what do you think? I say we do it. Nothing to lose, guys. We will make a vlog. And I will be the director. Let's do it. Don't stop short like that. -This is the place. -What place? What place? The place where the sightings of the accident victim in the factory... 15 years ago is located. When this factory was still in use. Let's spread out. Are you crazy? -Rama, you and Celsi go that way. -No way. Farel and Quincy go that way. Fira and Hana will go with me. We'll be recording with this camera. -Are you crazy? -What are you thinking, Garin? We have to be together. -This is our vlog. -We have to stick together. What's that noise? -Probably a rat. Don't exaggerate. -But I really heard something. You didn't hear it? I'm scared. What if someone is here? I don't think rats can make that noise. I bet someone threw a stone over there. She's talking about logic in a place like this? Babe, seriously. So, guys. Do you think that was a rat or.. -What's wrong with you? -I saw... -What now, Hana? -Something passed that way. I'm scared. -Let's see the camera. -It's not clear, because it's dark. -Try and zoom again. -Zoom again. Only 10,000 views in five days? How come, Garin? Maybe they think it's staged. It's the same location with The Jackal. And also a trending topic. So what now? We have to find a location that The Jackal never used. But where? They're always 10 steps ahead. Guys, calm down. Give me time and I will know their plan. Hana, come with me. What do you think? We can't, Joy. You see this? Nobody comes to that island ever since that tragedy. The police officer that was assigned to close the island... is mysteriously missing and hasn't been found. It's so dangerous. Which is good actually. It can be something new in our vlog. Because, exactly 13 months ago, a bloody tragedy happened on that island. Do you realize what you've just said? Joy, we're not that great. How many more likes and followers do we need to make you happy? Remember. The Jackal is not an exorcist. There's a limit in our activity. Klara, trust me. Nothing bad can happen. And if something does happen, it's good for our vlog, isn't it? What are you saying? Do you think you can ask your social media followers to die? I'm not that stupid. Klara. Wait. Klara. Tomorrow, on the 13th, we'll go to Ayunan island. Garin. Bring all the equipments and your camera. And the rest of you, just bring what you need. We will destroy The Jackal. (Ayunan Island, 1:00 P.M.) Yo, guys! What's up? Now it's the 13th, Wednesday, 1:00 p.m. We've just arrived at the resort reportedly to be haunted. It's located in Ayunan Island. So, 13 months ago, one family was slaughtered here. So, we, The Borju Vlogger, presents... Horror Vlog Reality Show. Let's turn now. Fira! You scared me! You said you wanted to become a famous horror director. But you got scared so easily. You look like a ghost. Of course I'm scared. Fart boy, even a ghost would die for a second time because of your fart. What are you talking about? Watch what you're saying. My mommy said we have to be extra careful in a place like this. Spoiled kid. You should've just stayed home and not come with us. Annoying. -Scaredy cat. -Don't mess up my hair! Mommy said, just stay close to me. Ew. Okay, guys. Bye for now. Wait for me. Hold on. -We just go straight from here? -Yes. -Enough about logic. -All right. Follow me. Enough, okay? The camera will die. This is it. It looks totally different than what we saw on internet. Joy and Klara fooled us. They posted fake pictures and tricked us to come here. Or maybe they know that we've been spying on them. Because we made the same video about the old factory. Right? The logic is, how can Joy and Klara fabricate the tragedy in this house? This villa was established. 2.5 years ago. And also for 2.5 years I've been working as a manager for this villa. But there's no such thing as the bloody tragedy as you said. It's a hoax. The pictures you saw on the internet have been edited. It's a lie. The manager of our competitor must have done it. But people say one family was slaughtered here 13 months ago. That's what I meant by a hoax. It's a lie. Impossible. It can't happen here. But the effect now, for the last 13 months, this villa has been abandoned. This is the way it is, because we don't get too many guests. So there's no ghost here? We can have a vacation here. -So it's pointless. -Yeah. No. Your visit wont be pointless. I guarantee you that you will be safe, relaxed and spoiled here. I will introduce you to someone named Stella. Stella. Stella. Her name is Stella. Hi. Stella will be your tour guide on this island. Welcome to Ayunan Island Resort. Before taking you to your rooms, I want you to try our chef's food. The food is amazing. Jaka will take your luggage to your rooms. I'll get Jaka. Jaka. Jaka, come here. -This is Jaka. -Hello. I'm sorry. Jaka can't speak but he can hear. So he can understand what we say, but to communicate with him is a bit difficult. Take the luggage to their rooms. Give your luggage to him. It's okay. Okay. Ready? Who's hungry? Come. -Have some more drinks. -Thank you, chef! -Okay. This is Chef Papang. -Hello. Chef Papang will cook for us during our stay at this resort. My name is Garin, chef. -I'm Papang. Hello, everyone. -Hi! Chef, are we going to cook now? -We will cook. -I'm coming with you to record it. -Okay. Wait for a second. -Okay, chef. -Have you put the memory card in? -Of course. There! What? Oh my God. This is Jailangkung that Farel made for the property. I don't care! If it's still there, I want to go home! Rama, if your sister keeps crying to go home, we'll be in trouble. Okay. Don't use that Jailangkung. -Get rid of it. -Here, let me hide it. Just throw it away. -Okay, Hana. -Done. -Done. It's gone now. -Come on. You don't have to be scared. It's just a prop. I didn't sleep at all last night to make this. And now it's useless. It's not useless. On my count. Rama, you first. Come on. One, two, three! -Now let's do it three on three. -Yeah, three on three. Can we do it? Of course you can't. -Celsi. -Yeah? -Rama! -Rama! Let's drink. When I searched about this resort, they said something about bad signal. But someone posted a comment that there's a spot with a good signal... and it's about two kilometers from here. It's not cool. So we have to walk that far if we want to post a status? Don't worry. I saw Mr. Fandi's bike. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if we borrow it. But we can't go with the group. I don't want to go just the two of us. It's too scary. You're always scared. Quincy. What's wrong? You've been so quiet. Now I'm thinking. If The Jackal didn't pull a prank on us and this island is really haunted... Don't say that. That's good. If this island is haunted, we can make a great vlog. I'm serious. When we were at the swimming pool, I got a really strange feeling. -Stop it. -What do you mean strange? When we were at the swimming pool... Farel! What do you think you're doing? That's not cool. It's not funny. Go! My heart is pounding. -I wanna go home! -No. It's okay. Rama? Rama? Rama? Farel? Don't try to scare me, okay? Celsi. Celsi. Celsi. Celsi. Celsi. Celsi! Celsi! Celsi! Are you okay? What's the matter? -What did you see? -What's going on here? Why? Over there! Oh my God. This is Darsih. I'm so sorry. Darsih is the helper who cleans this villa. One second. Darsih, I told you not to clean at night. You will scare the guests. Darsih, you go home now. Oh my God. I am so sorry. Darsih is a little bit weird. But she's a very hard worker. That's why Mr. Fandi still keeps her around. Are you all right? Nothing is wrong here. You better get some rest. I'm going home now. Do you usually go home at this hour? I live nearby, only two kilo meters from here. -Get some rest. -Okay. One, two, three. Nineteen, twenty. Are you sure you're like this because you did what the book said? Yes. Here. You want to try? No. I didn't bring the camera. What for? To see a ghost but we can't benefit anything from it? You're unbelievable. Seeing ghosts is not our hobby. We do this in the name of science and creation. I'm not your ex-boyfriend who's obsessed with The Jackal. All he can think of is how to defeat us. Don't think that I don't know... that you still stalk him in social media. Who said I still stalk him? You often use a wrong account. You stalk him with The Jackal's account, not your private account. You still like him, don't you? Just admit it. What are you talking about? You know I can be nosy sometimes. I heard that he would make a vlog with Garin. So I stalked him. What? Are you jealous? Of course I am. You know that, do you really have to ask? Okay. But seriously, I was only curious. You know, that I only care and feel comfortable with you. And that's enough reason for me to fall in love with you. Let's go back. Joy. They went to that island. Can you explain to me how come this doll got on my bed last night? -The logic is... -Listen, Mr. Fandi. I don't believe in myth. The reason we came here... is to find the prove whether or not this resort is haunted. If this resort is not haunted... and the bloody tragedy never happened here, I suspect that someone is trying to sabotage us. Listen to me. Have you asked your other friends? Maybe they just pulled a prank on you. My friends don't know where this doll came from. Miss. The door of that room is always locked. And that room belongs to the child of this villa's owner. So it's always locked. But I clearly saw that room was open. And the witness was the housekeeper. That's her. Stella. I'm sorry for your inconvenience. If Darsih is the one behind it, as a manager in this resort, I will fire her. Don't worry, okay? Oh my. Rama. Let's just go home. I'm scared. Stop whining about going home. Or you go home by yourself. Are you serious? A spot with a decent signal here? You hear that? That's cool! So we can upload the first part of our vlog. Agree? -I will take you there. -Cool! But where's that spot? They said it's two kilometers from here. -Hello. -Hi, chef. This is the special soup. -Thank you, chef. I don't believe in myth. Greedy. Please pass me the rice. -I'm on a diet. -Do you smell something fishy? -No. -Really? I don't think so. -Why are you yelling at me? -Are you nuts? This is dining table. Don't fart! -What? -I know it was you. Who else? The gecko? I swear I didn't. I only fart when Hana's around. I get nervous when she's near me. If she's not here, I don't fart. He's right. He won't get nervous because of you. Then what is this fishy smell? Beats me. I've contacted Garin and Rama through their social media accounts. But no one replies. Their last update was around the time when they left to that island. Garin and Rama's number that you gave me, I called them too. -But those numbers are off. -Yeah, I know. I asked for their other numbers but everything is off. Maybe they don't get phone reception on that island. Jaka! Jaka, thank you so much. Really. Thank you. Give me a ride. You think? I ride the bike and you sit on the back? You're heavy. You will give me hernia. All right. Hold my camera. Get off first. I have to turn the bike that way. What's wrong with you? Come on. By the way, how heavy am I? As heavy as your sins. Stay away from this room. So you're the one who put this doll on my bed last night? What's wrong with her? Darsih! Darsih! -Celsi. Let's go for a swim. -But... What? Let's go now. Let's go while the weather is nice. Stella said it will rain soon. But accompany me to the bathroom first. I got stomachache. It must be chef Papang's food today. It's not fresh and it's fishy. -Really? -Yes. Fira said so too. -I don't think so. -Hey, where's Fira? She's at the swimming pool already. We're waiting for you. Let's go. To the bathroom first. Can't you go alone? -What a spoiled baby. Come on. -Let's go. Why did it stop? But I just charged it. Hello. Why hasn't she showed up? Help! Help! Jaka. I want to ask you something. When I held the doll from the room 13, I could see that you were terrified. What's going on? Do you know something about that doll? Or do you know the owner of the doll? You don't need to be afraid. I promise I won't tell about it to anyone. But please be honest with me. Mr. Fandi said that the room belongs to the daughter of the resort's owner. And it has been locked for 13 months. Why? (Missing) So, Ranti has been missing for 13 month? And she still hasn't been found? Something is strange with this place. Praise be to God, we're finally here. -I got the signal here. -Really? We got it! -Don't let me fall. -I got you. We got the signal here! Let's make a vlog. Okay. It's uploading. Yo, guys! What's up? Now you will follow our adventure in our Horror Vlog Reality Show. Yeah! My friends and I are still in Ayunan Island... where the bloody tragedy occurred. You will see some super scary and super real sightings. Don't go anywhere. We will be back. Okay! -Check your direct message on Instagram. -Let me post this first. Check it first. Joy messaged me, asking me to tell you to read your message. Joy? Why? I don't know. Let me upload something now. What happened? What is it? -What is it? -I'm laughing out loud now. -I'm laughing hard. -Let me see it. -Joy is being ridiculous. -Let me see. -He's a freak. -Let me see. He knows we're here and he is trying to sabotage us. What did he say? -Okay, let me see it already. -Yeah. In a minute. -Let me see. -Wait. I just want to read it. -Wait. -I hate you. -Why are you whining? -Just do it yourself. Okay, you can see. -Do you want to see it? -No. -You feel better now? -Better. Finally. The weather is so nice. Where's Fira? Maybe she's taking a walk. -Let's just swim. -Come on. Why did she leave her phone here? What? That's her phone. Where is she? Fira. -Fira!-Fira! -Fira! Fira! -Fira! -Fira! Fira! Fira! Fira! Is she inside? Fira's missing? How come? No way. She probably went somewhere looking for a phone signal. That's impossible. She even left her phone here. The logic is, this is not a small resort. Why did Fira leave without telling us or waiting for us... and left her stuff here? Guys, calm down. If she still doesn't show up after dark, Mr. Fandi will call the police. -Right, Mr. Fandi? -Yes, sure. I will surely call the police. But it's actually like this. This might be a big resort, but this island has the form of a circle. I'm sure she got lost somewhere nearby. She will be back. Just stay calm. Okay? -Don't worry. -Okay. Thank you. -Now please excuse us. -Okay. Fira! Fira! -Fira, where are you? -Fira! Fira, where are you? -Fira! -Fira! Fira! Where is she? Where is she? Fira! Fira! Fira! Fira! Where else should we look for Fira? Rama, have you asked Mr. Fandi to call the police? I have. He will let us know immediately. But we still haven't heard from him. He didn't even come to meet us here. Maybe he's waiting for the police to come... and will look for Fira with them. Right? Come on, just go home. We shouldn't be here. Hana, stop it. If you keep annoy me like this, you can go home by yourself. Rama! Be patient! This is all your fault. You provoked us to come here in the first place. -Why me? -You provoked us to come here. Why me? Blame that fart boy! He's too obsessed with becoming a director! -Why me? -What's all of this? It's your fault. You want to defeat The Jackal, so it's your fault. Whose idea is this? The vlog was your idea. -Yes, but you want to defeat The Jackal. -So why did you blame me? -So it's your fault. -Guys! Come on. We won't find Fira if we keep arguing like this! Now... -Guys, stay calm. -Where's the flashlight? -Guys, stay calm. -It's okay. -Listen, guys. -Stay calm. In this condition, we have to count our members. -One, two, three, four... -Garin, stop! What's wrong with you? Can't you see how terrified Hana is now? Stop it! I mean it, Celsi. There's six of us. If one is missing, we can try and look for them. -But what if there's one extra here? -What are you saying? Guys, stop! Just hold on. We better go to the lobby, find Mr. Fandi and the fuse box. -You wait here. You'll be okay, right? -Are you serious? -Yeah. -Are you serious? -I won't be long. -No. Let's go with them. We shouldn't split up. -Quincy, you stay with Hana. -It's okay, Hana. Garin, Farel, let's go. Be careful. Don't be long. Just stay here. Mr. Fandi. Mr. Fandi. Mr. Fandi. Where is he? Wait for me, guys. It's off. But the wire is connected. We should check. Guys. It's broken. -You're right. It's broken. -What should we do? Stay calm. You're okay, Hana? We'll wait for Rama and the others to come back. It's so dark here. They've been gone too long. Be patient. It's okay. Fira? Fira? Quincy, don't go! Quincy! -Help! -Quincy! Fira! Where is she? Fira! Fira! Fira. Fira. Fira. Fira? Fira? Fira? Fira? Fira? Where is that girl? Fira! Fira? Miss Stella. You scared me to death! What are you doing here? I'm looking for my friend, Fira. She's been missing since this afternoon. Fira is in my house. How come? When I saw Fira, she was terrified. I tried to take her back to the villa but she refused. I know. Why don't you come with me to pick her up now. Come on. -Okay. I will tell the others. -No. Fira told me that she only wanted to see Quincy. You are Quincy, right? Yes. All right. Let's go and get her. Come on. Farel, you stay here and find the fuse box. Garin and I will find another telephone. -Alone? -Are you scared? -Says who? -Wait here. Quincy! Quincy! Where is she going? Jaka! You scared me. I'm looking for the fuse box. Help me, Jaka. Don't just stand there. I'm scared. Jaka. Jaka. Jaka. Jaka, where are we going? -Rama! -What's wrong? -What's wrong? -Stay calm. -Have you seen Quincy? -Quincy? Where did she go? Oh, no. Celsi! I told you not to split up! She just left unexpectedly. -How come? -Where's Farel? He's looking for the fuse box. Listen. From now on, we have to stick together. I am positive. Something is wrong with this place. Not only this place. I'm sure Mr. Fandi has something to do with this too. He never called the police. The phone line seems to be cut off too. Try to stay calm now. Now we'll wait for Quincy, Fira and Farel to come back. Okay. Stay calm. Miss Stella, is it still far away? Miss Stella, that's Darsih. What is she doing there? Miss... Miss Stella? Miss Stella? Where is she? Darsih? Miss Stella? Miss Stella! Which one, Jaka? We're looking for the fuse box, right? Jaka. It's still on. Do you have another fuse box here? Jaka? Jaka? Jaka? Jaka. I clearly saw Darsih under that haunted tree. -But then she just disappeared. -Really? Jaka did too. Stella disappeared too. Really disappeared in a blink of an eye. Seriously? I'm positive. Something is wrong here. -Guys, what if.. -Enough. Let's just go home, okay? We can't. We have to wait for Fira to come back now. Because we have to get the evidence no matter what. Right. Listen. I will be waiting for Fira until morning. I won't sleep. -Yeah? -Okay, me too. -You too, Farel. -Yes, me too. Gosh! -Fira. -What's the matter? -You look like you've just seen a ghost. -Where have you been last night? -Fira! -Hey! Where have you been? We were so scared and looked for you everywhere. What's going on, Fira? You scared us all, you know that? Sorry, guys. I just pulled some pranks on you. -So, you switched off the power? -Yes. -And you cut off the phone line too? -Yes. It's not funny, Fira. I'm sorry. It's okay. Fira is fine and it's all that matters. But please don't make this kind of joke ever again. We even thought this resort was haunted because of you. Sorry, guys. But now I'm fine and I came back here safely. -Were you really worried? -No! Are you happy that I'm back? -Let's eat. It's morning already. -Okay. Let's eat. -Sorry, guys. -Annoying. -This sambal is the best. -Amazing. It's really good. Even though we have soup here. Are you full? But you're not finish yet. I will finish it. I'm starving. You eat like a horse. The food is really tasty. This is the best. -Hello. How's the food? -Hi, chef. Amazing! -Why are you so good at this? -That's right. The food in this resort the best. Especially the soup and seafood. But it's a good thing that you're not picky eaters. You want more soup? -No. Thanks, chef. -Okay. -The soup is amazing. -It is. Rama, Farel, come with me to the bathroom. One minute. -But I'm not finished. I'm still hungry. -Yeah, but just for one minute. -Come with me. -The food is in the house, yo! -Please. -May I help you? No. Need to use to bathroom? Let me walk you there. -No, thanks. Rama can go with me. -What? I'm eating. -Please. One minute. Come with me. -What a baby. -You want us to hold it for you? -Yeah. Hold it for me. Rama, one minute. Please You always go alone. Why act like a kid? One minute. I really have to go to the bathroom. What's wrong with him? You said that Fira and Chef Papang were ghosts? Garin! I know you're obsessed with becoming a horror movie director. Nothing's wrong with being obsessed, but don't hallucinate. Joy messaged me on Instagram. I screenshot it so we could laugh at it together. But now, I think Joy can become our savior. Joy? Why did you bring him up? Do you know what he said? He said it's true that this island and resort are dangerous. That tragic incident really happened 13 months ago. This island is cursed... because it's filled with restless dead spirits... that are trying to get more victims to stay here forever. Got it? Garin. You're getting more and more delusional. And you even believe in what Joy said. Okay. You don't believe me, do you? Joy said we wouldn't just believe in a story like that. That's why he gave me this. There are 13 things that we can do... to see ghost or spirit of the dead around us. These are 13 ways to see ghost? You're joking. Why don't you do one of these? Prove my words. We are in a great danger now. Fira, the one that we've known all this time... she's no longer Fira. Everything okay? Okay, chef. Ram, you dropped your money. Look. What's wrong? It's okay, chef. But the floor is a bit slippery here. Yes. Be careful. I will tell Jaka to mop the floor. Okay. Thank you. I'm right, aren't I? Oh my God. Joy said that the tragedy happened exactly 13 month ago, on the 13th at 1:01 a.m. So, 1 equals 13 in 24 hour time format. And do you remember what date and time we got here? Yo, guys! What's up? Now it's the 13th, Wednesday, 1:00 p.m. Guys, we have to do all the 13 ways from Joy... if we want to leave this island alive. But how should we do that? The third way. Close your eyes... and pull five strands of hair on the top of your head. And then open your eyes. Hana... Hana... The fourth way. Bow your head and wink your eyes three times. After the third wink, straighten up your head. The fifth way. Walk seven steps backward with one index finger pointing down. Hana... Stay calm. Follow me. I'm just not sure. Do they know what they're doing? Or maybe they start to get obsessed with our horror vlog? I don't understand. I feel stressed out. If they're wrong, it means we have lunatic friends. But what if they're right? Quincy, come with me now. -What are you doing? -What about me? Rama told us to wait here. The sixth way. Tie the two thumbs together. Raise them to your head level. The seventh way. Shave off your eyebrow and wear your underwear inside out. Rama. The seventh way doesn't work. I don't see anything. I shaved off my eyebrows and wear my underwear inside out. Why doesn't it work? You did it wrong. The seventh way. Shave off your two eyebrows. And then wear your underwear inside out. But wear it on your head. I can't do it. If I wear on my head, what will happen to my junior? -What now? -Okay. Use my underwear. Okay. Let's go. Rama... What do you see? What? Let's get out of here! The eight and ninth way... What's wrong with you? have to be done at the same time. Ranti? You are Ranti, right? I saw the flyer. You're the missing child, aren't you? Don't say that. The tenth way. Put some stones in a glass. Then shake it gradually faster and harder. Hana! Hana! -Hana! -Quincy! Hana! -Quincy! -Hana! -Help! -Hana! Help! Celsi! Quincy! Open the door! -Celsi! -Hana! Help! Celsi! -We go get Rama! Hurry! -Hana! Rama! -Rama! -What's wrong? Hana... Where's Hana? She's locked up in the room 13! The eleventh way. Cover your eyes with the back of your hands. And then bite your lips. Darsih! I have to save my sister! Hana? Hana? Hana! Hana! Hana. Hana! Hana... Accompany me. Miss Stella said that her house is over there! Maybe we can find another house there. We can't believe what they said! -We have no choice, Quincy! -Right! See, Rama? There's never been a house here in the first place. This is their graves. It's a mass grave! They wanted to trap me here that night. I remember it well. -But there's no other way, Quincy. -I have to go back and get Hana. Rama! You can't go there. It's too dangerous. -I can't leave my sister alone! -Rama! Rama! Stay calm! -Hana is gone! -My sister. Get yourself together! Get yourself together. Hana is gone. Get yourself together. Let the police come and get her. Rama. Hana wouldn't want to see us die like her. You have to think of Celsi now. Come on, Rama! Come on, Rama. You have to think of Celsi, come on! You can't go back there. Rama! We've been looking for you in the villa. We have to leave at once. It's dangerous here. How do we know if they're human? Prove it that you are Joy and Klara! You know the 13 ways to see ghost, right? Do one of them and prove it if we're human or not. The 12th way. Take some dirt from the grave. Then wipe it in your eyes. -Hurry up! -Come on. Hurry! Use my handkerchief. Just stay close to me. You mean the one with the camera and we should say, "Hi, guys." "Hi, guys." The 13th way. Curl up like a fetus and put in your hands in your armpits. No! No. I don't want to go back there. And you shouldn't either. Hey. Fira's and Hana's bodies are still there! The police couldn't find their bodies too. Their spirits are still trapped between the two worlds. And they only can be found if Gapuro Tentrem is closed for eternity. "Thirteen Ways to Close Gapuro Tentrem"? Yes. Gapuro Tentrem. It's a border gate between the afterlife and the real world. If that gate is open, then the living can be defeated by the dead. And vice versa. -Garin, over here! -Garin! Don't open the door! The dead can cross over here. Come out! Come out, all of you! -Rama, calm down! -Come out! -They're gone. -Relax, Celsi.
