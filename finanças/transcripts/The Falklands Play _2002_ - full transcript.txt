RIDLEY: With permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a statement on the Falkland Islands. (MPs MURMURING) MP: Shame! Sit down! RIDLEY: I have this morning returned from consulting the Islanders as to the future of their homeland. We have no doubt whatever about British sovereignty over the islands. (MPs MURMURING APPROVAL) The Argentines, however, are being far more urgent in their demands and insistence on ownership. Decisive action must be taken. - It's 40 minutes to Heathrow. - Mmm. You're not going straight to the House of Commons? We've got to stop the rumours. - Why don't you get some sleep? - No, I'm all right. We'll check this with Peter Carrington on the way through, huh? Yep. The options available to us include, surrendering sovereignty of the Islands to the Argentines... MP: Never! SPEAKER: Order! ...in exchange for a long lease of them back to Her Majesty's Government. Leaseback. (MPs CLAMOURING) Order! Order! You seriously intend to announce this in half an hour? I've toned that draft down a bit. The backbenchers will fall on you like a pack of wolves. They're rubbed sore enough as it is over Rhode... 1 mean Zimbabwe. What do you think, Robin? Well, if Mr Ridley can crack the Falklands problem once and for all, everyone will applaud. Well, of course they will. This... Well, it's not that it's wrong in principal, but it's far too blunt. Well, can't we put it on ice until Rhode... Zimbabwe is out of the way? Peter, we just can't afford to keep those Islands on indefinitely. Well, I'd sooner face a herd of charging rhino. It is absolutely essential, however, that British law, administration, and way of life, continue on the Islands for the time being. That is what the Islanders have chosen and that is what they shall have! Mr Speaker? Yeah, Mr Peter Shore. This is a very worrying statement. (MPs AGREEING) Will the Minister confirm that involved here are the rights and future of 1,800 British people in a territory that was originally uninhabited? Will he affirm that there is no question whatsoever of surrendering these islands to Argentina against their wishes? Order! The answer to all the right honourable gentleman's questions -is yes. - Order. Mr David Lambie. Is the minister aware that there was no need for his statement today, which will only increase the Islanders' suspicions about our intentions? Why can't you leave well alone? Order! Order! - Order! Order! - If we don't do something, Argentina will invade! And there would be nothing whatever we could do about it. Order! The poor fellow took a terrible hammering, as if some sort of floodgates burst. Well, are you surprised? His timing was totally and utterly wrong, Peter. Totally and utterly wrong. Even to consider just handing over 2,000 of our own people to an evil regime like that. Their record on human rights is bloodcurdling. In return for a long leaseback? Which the Argentines would instantly dishonour. The whole thing smacks to me of a nasty little Foreign Office plot. Well, it's hardly surprising is it? We can't afford to keep them on. I don't mean you, dear. Eight thousand miles away, a contracting navy... In two years time, we won't even be able to defend them. Why can't we simply leave things as they are? Well, if we do nothing, Nicholas thinks they could invade. - What? - There's a new mood in Buenos Aires. More hot-headed. (SCOFFS) They've been talking about invasion for years. Well, Nicholas has been there, we haven't. - Morning. Morning. Morning. - Morning, Prime Minister. What a lovely morning. The frost looks simply magical. I do hope everyone managed to get some sleep after last night's debate. Willie, dear, you were a hero. Come on, everybody. The press have been so silly about it this morning. The instability of the regime is at the heart of it. The military junta have utterly failed to control the economy or inflation, which roars away like a volcano. It is a government of terror, torture, execution without trial, thousands of people a year. Not unlike the Gestapo. They may make such a hot-headed gesture as to invade. Personally, I think it unlikely. None the less, Prime Minister, has the Foreign Office formed a view as to what form any Argentine invasion might take? There's been a meeting of the head of South American Department, our ambassador in Buenos Aires and others to try to anticipate what might transpire. Prime Minister, do we have a planned response to that? Aren't you going to reply? Well, with respect, I think that's rather a question for the Foreign Office. After all, they're the people who've had such discussions. No, Prime Minister, we do not have a planned response. We can't keep half the Army and the Navy down there just in case. Well, we have got the icebreaker HMS Endurance patrolling in the area. She could be a form of deterrent. And also a nuclear-powered sub could be deployed from Gibraltar. - How long will that take to arrive? - Seven to ten days, Prime Minister. There's another factor, Prime Minister. The Minister of State acknowledges that his parliamentary reception of leaseback was a grave blow, even a disaster. 1 suggest that we await the reaction to this from the Argentinian military junta, General Galtieri and the other two, before deciding the next step. (ALL AGREEING) - Is that the general opinion? - I think so, Prime Minister, yes. Very well. But we must not lose sight of this one. Next item. Rhodesia, uh, Zimbabwe. Argentina. It's where the nuts come from isn't it? No, no, Willie, that's Brazil. Oh, is it? well, it's all comic opera land, anyhow. Do you know that they haven't fought anyone for over 100 years except each other? What do you think, Robert? The junta will have to introduce a savage economic package. With inflation at 150%, they've no option. That could mean rioting in the streets, martial law and an ungovernable country all over again. Surely they couldn't mount an invasion with all that going on? Not even as a uniting factor? Something the Argentine people have wanted passionately for over 100 years. Have you read the Foreign Office assessment of the Argentinian invasion plan? - Yes. - Is the plan realistic? Well, so far as 1 remember, it consisted of a series of graduated steps. Denouncing us in the UN is an early one. Then there's an invasion of the little islands of South Georgia. - That's an early one, too. - Surely, it's all hypothetical? The Foreign Office have assured me that, in practice, invasion is out of the question. Well, good. MAN: Governor, Falkland Islands, to Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London. I had this morning received a signal from the island of South Georgia. An Argentine naval vessel has been observed at deserted Leith Harbour. A party of civilians have established themselves ashore, claiming to be scrap metal merchants. Shots have been fired and the Argentine flag raised. I've consulted Captain Barker of HMS Endurance and requested he be ordered to sail to South Georgia with all dispatch to enforce eviction. The Argentine Navy may be using these men as a front to establish an Argentine presence on South Georgia. - The Falklands to South Georgia is... - Eight hundred miles. Tell our ambassador to make the strongest protest. But we mustn't overreact. Overreaction is perhaps what they want. 1 shall have to say something in the House. Play it down, don't be provoked. Most of the personnel left on 21st March. However, the base commander has reported that a small number of men and some equipment remain. We are making arrangements to ensure their early departure. {MPs CHUCKLING) Mr Denis Healey. Is it not the case that the Argentine party planted an Argentine flag on this British territory? Yes, for a short time the Argentine flag was planted. It has now been removed. Could this incident be connected with the Argentine threat to take unilateral action over the Falklands, unless negotiations really progressed? {MPs CLAMOURING) Order! Order! Robin, make it crystal clear that we urge Mr Haig to personally intervene with the Argentine government. (TELEPHONE BUZZING) Yes. Yes, Prime Minister. Yes, Margaret. Two Argentine corvettes have broken away from routine manoeuvres and are steaming towards South Georgia. Well, we're trying not to worry about South Georgia. Where's the Chief of Defence Staff? - Where's Admiral Lewin? - MAN: He's in New Zealand. THATCHER: Can we review this on the way to Brussels in the morning? Yes, I'm telling Nicko Henderson to tell the Americans they've just got to stop this. Nicko. What do you mean, "even-handed approach"? The Argentines are good friends of ours now, you know that. You're both good friends, Mr Ambassador. Are you seriously putting Her Majesty's Government on the same level as a bunch of fifth-rate comic-opera thugs? One little rocky, barren, ice-bound island? John Nott thinks we should send submarines now to support Endurance. I think he's right. The Argentines have built up a dangerous head of steam. It gives them very little room for manoeuvre. Though anti-government riots are not exactly the best platform for launching a war. - Riots? -452, appendix A. "The reaction to the junta's economic package. "Public sector spending frozen totally, personal taxation up by 90%." The whole country is going up in smoke. "Scores of people shot by the army." There's a leader in La Prensa this morning which says that the only thing that can hold this government together now is a war. I called a senior op staff meeting this afternoon to review the options presented to us, following the dispatch of the submarines to the South Atlantic. - Yes. - Now, if things do get worse, if the Argentines invade the Falkland Islands, for instance. - Yes? - Argentina has a substantial navy. At least six ships fitted with Exocet, four submarines, a good carrier. The air force has 200 planes fully capable of launching an attack against any British task force approaching by sea. The problems of operating against such a force 8,000 miles from Fleet Headquarters are immense. Therefore, we reject any task force which does not embrace all the forces. Aircraft, carriers, submarines, escorts. A full amphibious assault force. What? If things do get worse, we only have two military options. - One is to do nothing. - And the other? - To send in the fleet. - What? Send in the fleet. - All of it? - Substantially. - Nothing in between? - Not really. I see. - The entire fleet? - Yes, you see... I get the point. A full British battle fleet putting to sea in anger. There's been nothing like this since Suez. Can we leave Suez out of this conversation? Sorry. It's one of those little words that irk. (TELEPHONE RINGING) - Nott. - Duty Office, Defence Ministry, sir. - Sorry to wake you at such an hour. - I wasn't asleep. There was an emergency meeting of the Cabinet Intelligence Group West at 2:30 this morning. - Yes? - To assess signals -monitored by GCHQ Cheltenham at 1:00am. - What signals? where from? They've called a joint Intelligence Committee at 7:30 in the Cabinet Office. Um, it's from the South Atlantic, sir. Have you seen Number 13 in the annexe? We knew last night they were redeploying those warships, but not for this. 1 was assured, absolutely and categorically, that this could not happen. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - Good afternoon, Prime Minister. - You've been briefed on this? I have but not Robin. Just after midnight, the Argentine fleet broke away from the exercise with Uruguay and began steaming south at top speed. Their only aircraft carrier, the Veinticinco de Mayo, left port 20 minutes later and is heading straight for the Falkland Islands. And this is the direct intercept of a signal to the submarine Santa Fe, ordering her to surface and carry out an immediate survey of beach landing sites -around Port Stanley. - Get Peter Carrington back. And the Chief of Defence Staff. Where's Admiral Leach? I've signalled him to return immediately. We must get onto Reagan. The Americans must stop this. - I tell you they're invading. - It's just not possible, Mr Ambassador. It's there! It's in the intelligence reports! You think we made this up? - Why wasn't I informed of this? - What? But I had a categorical assurance from their foreign ministry that they would not invade. Well, he's made a monkey out of you. Get onto our ambassador in Buenos Aires. Tell him to go and see Galtieri now. Tonight. And demand to know what the hell he's up to. - Could not President Reagan... - I'll go and see the President myself. President Reagan has twice tried to speak to him. General Galtieri has refused to take his calls. Refused? Well, on both occasions, he was apparently told to try again later. - It could still be a bluff. - With the entire Argentine Navy at sea, moving into position where they could invade the Islands within 48 hours? How quickly could we mount a task force? Oh, it's far too late for that. Not too late as a diplomatic lever, John. Well, if they really are invading, Prime Minister, surely we should avoid doing anything provocative, in case the Islanders... Avoid doing anything provocative? What do you think they're doing? - Yes, but what 1 mean is... - Snatching and grabbing by force what they have failed to gain through honest negotiation. (INTERCOM BUZZING) "Avoid anything provocative." Let them get away with this, and we send a signal round the entire world to all aggressive, greedy, unstable states and dictators that they can just march in and grab and get away with whatever they want because the democracies are too feeble to say no. - Admiral Leach is outside. - Thank God. Ask him, please, to come in. Come in, please. Morning, Prime Minister. How quickly could you mobilise a full task force for the South Atlantic? It would have to be a balanced fleet, Prime Minister, not just a small squadron. Yes? We have a group of our ships currently off Gibraltar on exercise. They could regroup and sail within 24 hours. The core of the fleet, the carriers Hermes and Invincible, they're at Portsmouth. It's now Wednesday night. They could sail by the first tide Monday morning. - You're certain of that? - Absolutely, if you made the decision to prepare this evening. Do we need Cabinet approval for that? No. I can authorise emergency preparations. Well, then do so. It will show them we mean business, which we do! (STAMMERING) No, 1 understand, sir, but... What is it, Al? Who said you could come in here? Galtieri's on the line, waiting. I'll have to get back to you, sir. Sorry. - Yes, Jean, put him through. - am through. And I'm very glad and grateful to be able to talk to you at last, General. You see, we're getting more and more reports that you're about to invade those, uh... Those little islands down there. - You know the ones I mean. - The Malvinas. Never mind what we call them. Now, listen... The British have refused to acknowledge our sovereignty for over 150 years. Mr President, time has run out. But you can't start a war. You'd be the aggressor, you must see that. Listen, 1 tell you what I'm gonna do, General. I'm gonna send Vice President George Bush down to mediate. He can leave first thing tomorrow morning, all right? There is no point in sending Mr Bush. It is too late Then do 1 have your assurance, sir, that you are not going to invade? (TELEPHONE CLICKS) - Hello? Hello? - Line's gone dead. He hung up on me. What do you mean, we don't know? All lines to Port Stanley are dead. We simply don't know whether there's been an invasion or not. What about local Falkland Island radio? Don't we monitor that? Apparently not. So I'm calling a Cabinet to discuss an invasion we don't even know has happened. It could still be a bluff. We must not overreact but review our position in readiness for firm news. Foreign Secretary? I can't take any further steps till I know the military position. - Minister of Defence? -(SIGHS) The same. Prime Minister, Richard Luce can't avoid making a statement when the House assembles in an hour. What should he say? As little as possible. 1 suppose the House may have to be recalled for an emergency debate on Saturday. Well, that hasn't happened since the Suez Cri... It's unbelievable that the Foreign Office can't tell us whether there's been an invasion or not. Yes. Are the landlines to Argentina dead as well? No. Apparently, they're functioning normally. Oh. Well, then, perhaps we should telephone General Galtieri and ask him what's going on. Even at this late stage, we earnestly hope the Argentine government will reconsider their rejection of diplomatic channels to settle this dispute. The Falkland Islands are British, inhabited by British citizens who wish to remain British! (MPs MURMURING) SPEAKER: Mr John Brown. Will my right honourable friend accept that, in a case like this, possession is likely to be about nine-tenths of the law? {MPs CLAMOURING) Order! There's no question of your resignation. It was my job to foresee this. Do you think, as Foreign Secretary, I'm any the less responsible? You can't be responsible... Now, listen, you can earn your salvation. I'm putting you in charge of coordinating the diplomatic offensive to get the Argies out. If they are in. Well, they key to that is whether the Americans will help. Well, get on the telephone and ask them. Richard Luce demanded that Washington openly condemn Argentine military aggression, ambassadorial evacuation and an embargo on all arms shipments to Buenos Aires. - Siding with the British, right? - Exactly. Which would buy us 100 years of Latin American aggression. (SCOFFS) Baloney. I know all about Latin American policy, Mr President. I've spent years at it. The British are very suspicious of our position. Well, are you surprised? They know where Mrs Kirkpatrick was dining while the invasion was actually taking place. - It was a long-standing arrangement. - You could have postponed it. The Argentines should know who their real friends are. While the Argentines were actually storming ashore, shooting and blowing their way onto the island, Mrs Kirkpatrick was attending a banquet in her honour at the Argentine Embassy. That was the only date I happened to be free. I am UN Ambassador. And 1 was told all about it, AL You approved it? Yes, it was a policy decision made by me not to alienate them. Anyhow, if the Argentines own those islands, how can the moving in of their own troops be called aggression? I'd be real careful about saying that kind of thing in public, Jeane. - Sir, I have a suggestion. - Yes, Tom. There's oil under those islands and mineral deposits, rich ones, too. - Surely, sir... - No, Tom. Sir, if we make them agree to split the drilling rights, all this will blow over... I don't think this has anything to do with drilling rights. Then why have the British gotten so overheated? It's pride. It's patriotism. It's because the scars still hurt from the loss of the Empire. It's principle, Tom. The British are nice, reasonable people until someone starts kicking them around, and then they start behaving exactly like Mrs Kirkpatrick. (STAMMERS) Yeah, okay, Al, okay. Let's calm down here now. Okay, I think the... 1 think the US sympathises more with Great Britain on this... - But, Mr President, 1... - And 1 said, "1 think", Jeane, and 1... And the most practical expression of that sympathy, however, would be impartial US mediation. Now, that is what we offer the British. Uh, Ridley, Nicholas Ridley... No, there's been a change, sir, Richard Luce. Yeah, well, whoever it is, that's what we offer them. - Okay, everybody? - Mmm-hmm. All right, let's not lose any sleep over this one. It's just a little scrap over some old bit of sheep's pasture. Confirmation has been received in London that the Argentines have invaded and captured the Islands. The Argentine flag flies over Government House, Port Stanley. Diplomatic relations between our two countries have been severed, and a large naval task force is preparing to sail to the South Atlantic on Monday. - REPORTER 1: Have we declared war? - Not yet. But that's a legal point which will be dealt with by the law officers. REPORTER 2: Is the Government seriously planning to settle this dispute by killing people? We are not the aggressors. We have called the Security Council into emergency session to deal with this matter peacefully. We have, not the Argentines. REPORTER ON TV: The Security Council, preoccupied with other emergency resolutions on Central America and the West Bank, has had to set them aside to consider this latest threat to peace. 1 cannot find words strong enough 10 express my government's condemnation of this blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and of international law. The Council must act immediately. 1 propose the following draft resolution. "The Security Council, deeply disturbed at reports of an invasion "by the armed forces of Argentina, one, demands an immediate ceasefire. "Two, demands the immediate withdrawal of all Argentine forces from the Falkland Islands. "Three, calls on the governments of Argentina and of the United Kingdom "to seek a diplomatic solution to this dispute.” The Malvinas are part of Argentine territory, illegally snatched and grabbed by the United Kingdom in 1833 by act of force. Such a criminal action can give rise to no rights at all. 1 call upon all our friends who have suffered the cruelties and injustices and ruthlessness of European colonialism to reject this imperialist motion with contempt. There will now be a short recess before the vote is taken. - Ten votes. Just enough. - And it's a damn near run thing. - What's that about? - What? The Jordanians. They are one of our ten. Go and see them. I cited non-alignment, anti-imperialism, Argentine grain to Moscow. They will veto the motion, I'm sure of it. He's just received instructions from Amman to vote against us. - But he's just spoken for us. - I know. He's very embarrassed. So he should be. The Foreign Secretary left 10 minutes ago, Sir Anthony. You're in the Security Council chamber now? This is Margaret Thatcher. Can 1 help? Yes. Yes, 1 see. The Jordanians? I'll try. Will you get me King Hussein? (TELEPHONE RINGING) Order! Order! The vote will now be taken. (BUZZING) Yes? - Ten votes for. - The Russians could still veto. Panama's voting against. - Four abstentions. - They've done it! Oh, God. The House meets this Saturday to respond to a situation of great gravity. For the first time for many years, British sovereign territory has been invaded by a foreign power. The lawful British government of the Falkland Islands has been usurped. I am sure that the whole House joins me in condemning totally this act of unprovoked aggression by the government of Argentina against British territory. Hear, hear! It has not a shred of justification and not a scrap of legality. Hear, hear! The Government has now decided that a large task force will set sail as soon as preparations are complete. HMS Invincible will be in the lead and will sail on Monday. (MPs CHEERING) Meanwhile, we hope that our continuing diplomatic efforts meet with success. The Security Council meets again today. (MPs LAUGHING) Opposition members laugh. They would have been the first to urge us to meet with the Security Council, if we'd not arranged it. They would have been the first to accuse us of sabre-rattling and warmongering. The people of the Falkland Islands, like the people of the United Kingdom, are an island race. Their way of life is British. Their allegiance is to the Crown. They are few in number, but they have the right to live in peace and to choose their way of life and their allegiance. It is the wish of the British people and it is the duty of Her Majesty's Government to do everything we can to uphold that right. (MPs AGREEING) SPEAKER: Mr Michael Foot. The people of the Falkland Islands are faced with an act of naked, unqualified aggression, carried out in a most shameful and disreputable circumstance. (MPs AGREEING) Even though the people who live in the Falkland Islands are uppermost in our minds, it would be outrageous if this were not the case, there is the longer term interest to ensure that foul and brutal aggression does not succeed in our world. If it does, there will be a danger, not only to the Falkland Islands, but to people all over this dangerous planet. (MPs AGREEING) SPEAKER: Mr Enoch Powell. Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister, shortly after she came into office, received the sobriquet of the Iron Lady. In the next week or two, this House, the nation and the Right Honourable lady will learn of what mettle she is made. - Is she in? - Yes, but she's pretty shaken. Well, I don't imagine any of us are exactly... John Nott's resigned. Well, offered his resignation. I haven't accepted it. His department was not responsible. This is the time for resolution, not resignation. - Did you catch the end of the debate? - The last few minutes. John attacked the opposition's defence record. Oh, Lord. Lack of commitment to defence spending, lack of patriotism, that sort of thing. You couldn't hear him for howling and jeering. Sit down. I'm going to get you a drink. Margaret, someone's got to go. There's a massive attack on the Foreign Office for not foreseeing this. In my opinion, all three ministers should go. But no one could have foreseen this. My dear, we may be going to war. - Dear God, 1 hope not. But if we are... - Then someone's got to lance the boil. Despite all the loyalty out there, there's considerable disquiet about how it came about. You can't lead a country to war with that hanging round your neck. It would be read as disagreement with sending in the task force. Then 1 shall state that 1 support that policy 100%. Up to the hilt. Peter, 1 need you in Cabinet. Please, sleep on it. Talk to Willie. It's essential that the Cabinet have people in it who know what fighting is really like, who fought in the war and saw their chaps blown to bits about them, who have no romantic illusions about it. Do you realise that you and 1 and Francis are the only ones? (BELLS PEALING) I say, what a dear little fellow. What is it? Mezereum, I think. Daphne mezereum. It's a fine fellow. You won't shift me, Willie, you canny old Home Secretary. Listen to the bells. You know, sometimes England seems so close, it's as if you are about to turn a corner and bump into her putting dung on the roses. And she is always saying, "I stand for what I've always stood for. -"That's what I'm here for." - Noblesse oblige? No, it's rather more than that. It's recognising the moment that justifies everything else. Winston said as much in 1940. You're not seriously comparing this with 1940. - In size, no. Of course not. But you remember the march into the Rhineland four years before. That was about this size and, if we'd stopped that, there'd have been no Second World War. Now, just think of that. There is such a thing as ministerial responsibility. And there's also such a thing as comradeship, my dear, in times of trouble. Willie, that's why I'm going. Ah, good morning, Sir Terence. How splendid to see you back. - Have you had any sleep at all? - Enough, thank you, Prime Minister. Did they bring you up-to-date on the plane? Yes, and my team had an hour in the car back from Heathrow to put me straight and two hours back in the office. 1 should tell you, before we go in, that Francis Pym is taking over at the Foreign Office. - I heard Lord Carrington had resigned. - Yes. So now we've got Francis Pym. The War Cabinet will meet every morning at this time. Here during the week and at Chequers at weekends. We will report to the full Cabinet once a week and when we need their backing for some major decisions. Isn't that right, Robert? We are delighted that the Chief of Defence Staff is back. - Hear, hear. - Hear, hear. Is there anything you wish to say to us at this stage? Just this, Prime Minister. I think it'll be helpful if the government could define its objective. Objective? To win the bloody war. - Ah, please. - THATCHER: Yes, Attorney General. - We're not at war. - Of course we're at war. No. The Argentines, at no stage, declared war on us. - Well, yes. But... - For us to do so, when we're simply trying to reclaim what was wrested from us by force, would, in international law, put us on entirely the wrong footing. Well, that's just lawyers' quibbles. No, any action we take would be covered by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. The right to armed self-defence. Yes. 1 think that's perfectly clear. The question of objective. Is it simply to recapture Falkland Islands? No, that's too military. We can still regain them peacefully. Well, by economic means, you mean, sanctions, that kind of thing? What about, "To cause the withdrawal "of the Argentine forces from the Falklands "by economic, diplomatic, and, if necessary, military means, "and to restore British administration"? Military last. You see my point? - Yes. A last resort. - Yes. I think that states our position. Which brings us immediately to the central decision this morning. Secretary of State. Nine major warships have already left the fleet exercise off Gibraltar. They're steaming to the South Atlantic with full dispatch. They're here and here. Yes, the two big carriers, Hermes and Invincible have been in rapid preparation in Portsmouth throughout the weekend. They sail with six other warships, if we give signal, one hour from now. The object is to do so with maximum worldwide publicity and tub-thumping, to convince the Argentines that we really mean business. 1 think you should underline that to the House of Commons. - Yes, Prime Minister. - Make it absolutely plain that we're deadly serious. The Argentines are listening to every word we utter. Gauging our resolve, judging if we really mean it. Precisely. Exactly. - How long will they take to get there? - Three weeks. Three weeks of increasing pressure to back up the diplomatic offensive. That's correct. Let me get this quite clear, Prime Minister. We are sending in a task force but it won't be used in anger. Purely as a diplomatic lever, a tightening of the screw? Now, listen, if we send them, there must be no drawing back halfway. And that means if diplomatic means fail, then we have to fight. This must not be another Suez. No, that's totally and absolutely right, Willie. Precisely the point. Now, do we send those ships? Do we still have the will to fight aggression by force of arms? Even halfway across the world? Even at huge risk of world opinion turning against us? Because if we don't have it any more, for God's sake, let's say so now and pull out before we start. It may be we are going to war. People will get killed, innocent people. Young soldiers, many of whom won't even know what it is they're fighting for. Are we really prepared to do that? Do we still believe what we certainly believed in in 19407 Or is that now just the romance of history? Nothing to do with the cold realities of Britain in 1982. Part of a nation that has, actually, quietly died. As Greece died, as Spain died. Because if, in our hearts, we really believe that Britain is dead, then it would be a crime of the direst and blackest sort to send in those men to fight. A crime of which the country would very soon find us guilty because their hearts won't be in it. And the first death will light a fuse that would blow us sky-high and clean out of office at the next election. Now, do we send the signal or not? - Michael? - Yes. - Willie? - Of course we do. - John? - Yes. Francis? Yes. REPORTER ON TV: Steaming gently at first but with gathering force, HMS Invincible was the first to put to sea. AMERICAN REPORTER ON TV: Here in the United Kingdom... I'll tell you what I've been thinking. I've been thinking there might be some sort of mediating role for us. You see, it might be possible for the US to negotiate between you and the Argentines some sort of a mixed administration to run the island and... We are not going to negotiate until the Argentinians get out. Isn't that a little unreasonable? Two thousand people on some bleak, little rocks at the end of nowhere. Do you remember how all America felt about 52 hostages in Iran? Didn't we rush to help you the moment you asked? There's been no issue since 1939 on which the British public have felt so strongly. Right across party lines. 1 still see some sort of mediating role for someone. I could start for London tonight if this coincides with your crisis perception, Mr President. Shuttle diplomacy between London and Buenos Aires, huh? Trying to patch something up. - That's right, sir. - Mmm-hmm. Will your heart stand up to it? Sure. Sure. My heart's Mach 3. There's nothing whatever wrong with my heart. I don't know. Anyone with - what was it - a triple bypass coronary surgery? Mr President, I am 100% fit -100%. - All right, AL We've only got 17 days, okay, before the British get down there and this thing blows up into a full-scale war. The first action of the task force will be to deny the Argentine forces on the Falklands the means of reinforcement and re-supply from the mainland. NOTT: To this end, I must tell the House that the following notice has been promulgated to all shipping today. From 04:00 GMT on Monday, April 12th, 1982, a maritime exclusion zone will be established around the Falkland Islands. The outer limit of this zone is a circle of 200 nautical miles from the centre of the island. From the time indicated, any Argentine warships, submarines or naval auxiliaries found within this zone will be treated as hostile and are liable to be attacked by British forces. The force, now on the high seas and heading for the South Atlantic, is a formidable one. There are the carriers of HMS Invincible and Hermes with augmented complements of Sea Harriers and Sea King helicopters. Destroyers, Sheffield, Glasgow and Coventry armed with Sea Dart Frigates Arrow, Alacrity and Antelope with their Exocet surface-to-surface missile. When one stops a dictator, there are always risks. But there are far greater risks in not stopping one. Hear, hear! A lesson this country has learnt before. Let the world be under no illusion these people are British and we mean to defend them. We are in earnest and no one should doubt our resolve. MPs: Hear, hear! You'd think it was 1940 all over again. Hitler and Churchill and their finest hour. Argentina is also getting very edgy, Mr Secretary. The more excited they get, the harder it's gonna be for us. I've drawn up the 200-mile circle, Mr Secretary. Maritime exclusion zone. PILOT: London in seven hours, Mr Secretary. Why the hell couldn't the British have told us about this before we enplaned? Well, neither side wants a war. That's our strongest card. One, both sides should withdraw to 500 miles either side of the Falklands. Two, some sort of interim authority should be created on the Islands. Three, the status of the Falklands should be negotiated by 31 December. What do you mean, status? - Well... - Sovereignty? - Nothing should be excluded. - You do mean sovereignty? - I'm trying to de-escalise a war. - So am I. But you do not do it by appeasement. You increase its chances. - Mrs Thatcher, we're not... - You see this table? This was where Neville Chamberlain sat in 1938 when he spoke on the wireless about the Czechs as far away people about whom we know nothing and with whom we have so little in common. Munich! Appeasement! A world war followed because of that irresponsible, woolly-minded, indecisive, slip-shod attitude and the deaths of 45 million people. The fact that we have to treat Britain and Argentina even-handedly -for the purpose of negotiation... - How dare you treat us even-handedly! Argentina is the aggressor, the invader. A fourth-rate, cruel, unstable, corrupt, brutal regime with no morals or scruples whatever! They torture and murder their political opponents by the most ghastly Nazi methods. And this is the regime you wish to give even a foothold over British citizens? - The poor chap's head is still spinning. - Did she convince him? - It's difficult to say. - What are our orders for tonight? Rattle the Americans. Unnerve them. They can't just sit on the fence. - Ah, Terry. - Al, how very good to see you. Say, how sharp you guys look. Tuxedoes are the one thing we didn't think to pack. Oh, yeah. I'll have a soda water. How's the heart standing up after the op? The heart's fine, fine. Absolutely nothing wrong with my heart. Thank you. - Good evening, everyone. - Good evening, Prime Minister. - Good evening, Al - Good evening, Prime Minister. All we were expecting were some sandwiches around a conference table. I dare say we'll make you sing for your supper. Besides, 1 particularly wanted you 10 see this portrait I've had specially moved in here. Isn't it splendid? Hmm. Duke of Wellington and Lord Nelson. It was their British truculence against another dictator -that ensured peace for 100 years. - Yes, Prime Minister. 1 thought you might like 10 sit opposite them during dinner. - Gee, thanks. - Well, shall we de-hungerise? NOTT: The time factor is crucial. There's so little time. Before the fleet gets down there? No. 1 mean the weather. - The weather? - Yes. Winter's coming on fast in the South Atlantic. In a very few weeks, conditions will be appalling. Fifty-foot waves, temperatures that never rise above freezing. Impossible for you to mount the operation. - Exactly. - We're certain the Argentines hope to string things out till that point is reached, then we'd have no alternative. We'd have to withdraw the fleet. The entire political initiative would be lost. How do you know that's what the Argentinians planned? Wouldn't you, in their place? What precisely are you hoping to achieve with this shuttle? We want to find the line between your needs and the Argentine demands. Do you support Resolution 502 in the Security Council? Absolutely. 100%. But there will have to be compromises, Prime Minister. Although, of course, the Argentinians should not be seen to benefit from the use of force. Maybe you should let them keep some residual presence down there. - What? - HAIG: Mrs Thatcher... - But that would be giving into them. - No way. There will be no itemisation of sovereignty at this time... No item... No mention of sovereignty? But that's the central issue. That and self-determination. Well, maybe we could just gently coast around that one. How on earth could we do that? By using a certain constructive ambiguity of wording. Fudge. You'll try and fudge it. - The alternative, Mrs Thatcher, is war. - Yes, Mr Enders. And we don't want it any more than you do. But if the bully boy marches into your house and starts smashing up the furniture, the first thing you do, if he won't stop, is throw him out. PYM: Maybe we should ask the Islanders how they feel about that. What? Well, before we fight a war in or over Port Stanley perhaps we should ask the inhabitants whether they prefer Argentine rule to annihilation. They are British. They have chosen to stay British. They have appealed to us for help and we are giving it to them whole-heartedly. Whole-heartedly, except that is, for the Foreign Secretary! Yes, well, it's been a most interesting exchange of views. - I wish there were more like her. - You do? You know exactly where you stand. In the corner. ENDERS: It comes down to those five points. The Argentines will never accept this. If they did, it would mean the end of Galtieri. How long before Buenos Aires? Thirteen hours, sir. Mr Haig's visit is perhaps the last opportunity to avoid a military confrontation. But what real chance does he have? Judge for yourself. People had flocked into the central square, the Plaza de Mayo, since well before dawn. They'd been told to show Alexander Haig the feelings of the Argentine people. The three nuclear-powered submarines, Conqueror, Spartan and Splendid, are now well down in the South Atlantic. Yesterday, Spartan spotted the Argentine navy landing ship Cabo San Antonio laying mines off Port Stanley Harbour. The Argentine ship was here. Spartan radioed Fleet Headquarters in London for permission to attack and sink. - This was refused. - Why? Because we are doing our utmost to achieve a diplomatic settlement. At 4:00 am this morning, the maritime exclusion zone came into force and Congueroris there to enforce it. You call it a maritime exclusion zone. It's really just an old-fashioned blockade, isn't it? Of a kind, it's to prevent Argentine warships and auxiliaries delivering stores and reinforcements. What happens if an Argentine merchant ship tries to force its way through? If the diplomatic offensive is making the slightest headway, we turn a blind eye. Now, the main task force, assembled here at Ascension Island, is now steaming south. Now, in two weeks, the main battle group will arrive in the Falklands. Then the maritime exclusion zone becomes a total exclusion zone. Virtually anything of any nation will then be liable to attack without warning if it ventures inside. The next twist of the screw could be the recapture of South Georgia, over here. And the one after that, the establishment of air and sea superiority by drawing out Argentine warships and airplanes and destroying them in battle. This, we hope, will be completed before the arrival of the main landing force. We could call a halt to this at anytime? Absolutely. The moment they realise we're not bluffing. The moment they comply with Resolution 502. - I doubt they will. I doubt it. - Al Haig will know. - When does he get back? - Tomorrow morning. With his body clock in ruins. This is... This is really not so different from the British conceptualisation. Foreign Minister Costa Méndez gave me this for you, Mr Secretary. What day is it? Sunday. Easter Sunday. My God, so it is. "No negotiation without prior guarantee of sovereignty. "All British islanders to leave within one week." This... This is totally the opposite to what we just... What we just co-treatied. What status is that letter? It says, "Personal thoughts." Of a class-one screwball. What the hell kind of game is he playing? Mr Secretary, we have to cable the President in 15 minutes. Oh, hell, yes. Tell him... Proceeding Londonwards. Haig. Happy Easter. I don't understand the purpose of all these flags. - That's just a symbol, I think. - Of what? Just a face-saver. - No inference about sovereignty? - Over the Falk... I mean the Malvinas, sorry, the Falklands? No, no. Hmm. What is the main difference, as you see it, between your discussions with the Argentinians and with us? Well, they're usually drunk and you're usually sober. There is one point on which we might be able to shift a little. The trauma of the invasion may have induced the islanders to soften their previous intransigence. - THATCHER: Over leaseback. - Over Argentine involvement generally. (WHISPERING) This morning's New York Times. Did you know about this? From today's New York Times by Costa Méndez. This is what he called his "private thoughts". Word for word. Now, it seems, the official policy of Argentina. Not what you've brought us at all, is it? Well, what the hell do you mean by it? It is obvious the Malvinas must be governed by an Argentine government. There was no mention of that in the agreement. That wasn't an agreement. That was just some agreed notes. Dr Costa Méndez, war is very close. Is Argentina prepared to make any modification in its new position or is it...? But of course. Really? Provided the British will decolonise the Malvinas in compliance with the United Nations 1964 Declaration on Decolonisation. Declaration on Decolonisation. I've never even heard of it. We are trying to find a copy. 1 must say, it doesn't sound very promising. Their entire strategy is prevaricational, but if we're into a war, they'd lose. It still must be followed through, Al Every avenue. Here are our replies to the first Argentine proposals. We can shift on two points. Quite a concession, in my view. Maybe 1 should go back to Buenos Aires via Washington. Speak to the President. I could take my revised proposals to Galtieri. Haig II. That's an excellent idea, Al And make sure you get some sleep, especially after that heart operation... I'm fine, fine. I... I don't need any sleep. I have to tell my right honourable friends, with great sadness, that I, for one, am not part of that consensus which believes we should use force if diplomacy fails. I do not believe it would be right to seek out and destroy Argentine vessels, or to make an opposed landing. In other words, to kill people just to ensure that the Union Jack flies over what was left of the public buildings in the Falkland Islands. If the Government really intends to carry matters as far as that, I have no doubt they will have the support of this House. Alas, they will no longer have mine. {MPs MURMURING) Mr Haig's plane has been standing here at the airport since early this morning waiting to take him to London, when and if the Argentine government agrees to his proposals. As the negotiations became bogged down again... But we can't just go on talking forever. Clearly they have no intention of acting in good faith. And the weather down there is deteriorating rapidly, Prime Minister. Exactly. How long now before the first ships reach the maritime exclusion zone? Six days, Prime Minister. If the Haig mission has ground to a halt, the Americans should say so. They should come down publicly on our side, and the UN should take over negotiations. Francis could fly out tonight and set all this in motion. - It could be done by telephone, Prime... - Confront Haig face to face and demand to know whether you or he should take it to the United Nations. He can take Haig II, if he insists. Do you think it's wise for me to leave my desk? Yes! - Yes. - Rules of engagement. Admiral Lewin. The War Cabinet will be aware that the Royal Navy has always issued instructions to its captains about the circumstances in which they can fire on the enemy. Normally, these are based on the principle of self-defence, but as the task force nears its objective, the rules will need to be changed, as is normal in warfare. We're not yet in warfare. Do you have any particular circumstances in mind? Yes. Yesterday, Argentine Air Force Boeing 707s began to track the task force. Admiral Woodward requests permission to shoot them down. - Well, how are these planes armed? - They're unarmed. - But that would be intolerable. - If I may finish, Prime Minister. They are reconnaissance aircraft. Their job is to vector Argentine submarines and strike aircraft onto the track of the task force. One or both of our aircraft carriers could be sunk without having fired a shot and we'd have lost the war. That's the danger. Prime Minister, such permission should surely be limited to when our task force enters the maritime exclusion zone. To shoot them down on the high seas without warning... No one is suggesting they should not be warned. Even so. We are trying to achieve a diplomatic settlement. Hear, hear, Prime Minister. 1 should like no one to be in any doubt -about the risks involved. - The alternative is unthinkable. - Are we all agreed on that? - Hear, hear. Whatever the risk? Permission refused. It'll be a miracle if she agrees to this. Oh, pardon me, sir. I was given this for you. - By Dr Costa Méndez? - Yes. His private thoughts on our negotiation? Yes, sir. Tom. It goes back on everything. My conscience is clear. So should yours be. I just keep thinking of all those body bags. 1 won't give up. 1 will not give up. - South Georgia. - Ah, yes. The main question this morning is whether we mount an operation against South Georgia before the main landing on the Falklands themselves. CDS. South Georgia is 800 miles from the main objective. The island is mountainous, covered with glaciers. Weather conditions are pretty foul at this time of year. Heavy snow, gale-force winds. If an action to retake should fail or if there is substantial loss of life, it would be a devastating prelude to the main campaign. Having said that, the manpower and ships are available and we believe the island can be recaptured without diverting effort from the main objective. Defence Secretary. The public's becoming restless for some action that will keep the political will going. - But in my view, we should go in. - Home Secretary. Well, a short, sharp action like this would put ginger into the negotiations -before they pass onto the UN. - Whatever the weather? AMERICAN REPORTER ON TV: This is the first time the British Royal Navy has sailed in anger since the Suez Crisis 25 years ago. You're bound to casualtise. You can't help but casualtise. - And now, listen to me for... - It would be saving life. Don't you see? If Buenos Aires could be shocked into sense by one small landing without our having to invade the Falklands themselves. - I see that. 1 see that. - Yes, but does your President? We're trying to protect him from all this. - Protect? - And failing 100%. Every time he turns on the TV, he tells me, "There's Nicko Henderson "saying hoorah for Britain all over again." As far as I know there's been no estimate of costs, if we have to start fighting. Some may regard that as naive, but remember that we British spent the accumulative wealth of an entire century fighting two world wars, defending the cause of democracy and the freedom of the individual We had to wait for you from 1914 to 1917, from 1939 to 1942. How long shall we have to wait for you this time? Oh, boy! Hmm. Did you see the weather reports from South Georgia? Yes. Sea conditions aren't much better. Force-6 gales, flurries of snow, a lot of icebergs. Congueror reports one 35 miles by 12. - Have you seen 418? -418. Galtieri is actually on the Falklands at the moment. Giving pep talks to his troops. "The British may defeat us, but they cannot break our spirit." - He said that? About defeat? - Hmm, 302. Ah, here we are. We've just heard from HMS Antrim. The SAS helicopters are taking off at the moment. What are the conditions like? Extreme air turbulence, 15 degrees of frost. The helicopters are manoeuvring on pitching, icy decks. - Should we postpone the operation? - I don't think so, Prime Minister. If we did, the weather might become unpleasant. We think the enemy are here and here. There are about 120 Argentine marines on the island, we know that. These were taken at dawn today. You can see the terrain. Excuse me, Prime Minister. Can we communicate with the Antrim? I'm very worried about these conditions. Hello, Brian. The Prime Minister is with me. How is the weather looking outside your window? He says he lost sight of the helicopters as they disappeared into the snow. He could see them for the first 200 yards. Should we postpone the operation? Is it simply too awful? Brian, will the SAS be able to operate? He says it is okay as long as they can camp overnight. They've got tents. The problem is pitching them in a blizzard. - Can we not stay listening in? - I prefer not, if you don't mind. We have to let them make their own judgements. If you start listening in, the temptation is to start interfering. - Yes, true. - Excuse me. The Argentine carrier Veinticinco de Mayo has altered course, -northwards. - Away from the Falklands? Toward our approaching task force. Could mean nothing, of course. And the fourth item will be the Foreign Secretary's report on his meeting with Haig. And there will be a paper to go with that. Yes. There will be, of course. And the rest of the agenda is straightforward. - Were you ever in the forces, Robert? - No. We saw very little of the real war when 1 was a child. There was some bombing in Grantham and I suppose people were... There were casualties, but 1 don't remember much. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Yes. Can Admiral Lewin see you? - Of course. - Yes, please. - Good morning, Prime Minister. - Morning. Can 1 show you over here? Please stay, Robert. Those Wessex 5 helicopters. Here's where they landed last night. They tried to pitch tents. They were largely blown away. The temperature dropped to minus 40. There was a gale with 100-mile-an-hour gusts during the night. The two helicopters sent to rescue them both crashed and overturned. One of them filled with men it had just picked up. About here. - Casualties? - We don't know. The whole operation's been aborted while they try and get them out. (TELEPHONE BUZZES) Yes? Will you speak to the Chief of Defence Staff, Prime Minister? Yes, of course. - Hello. - I'm sorry to wake you at this hour. Have those men been found? Yes. They have frostbite and hypothermia but they're all alive. - Thank God! - But the weather's got worse. And I'm afraid a second attempt to land has had to be aborted as well. An enemy C-130 reconnaissance plane has been low-flying over our ships. And we've picked up signals from one of their submarines. Fieldhouse has ordered our ships to scatter. Then the main assault? We'll need to review that when we've located the sub, if we can find it. It's a terrible thing to send those men into fight, to risk their young lives in those atrocious conditions. - They're professionals. - Of course they are. And superb, but I've never seen fighting, Willie. Well, you'd be even more certain about what you're doing if you had. They've found the sub, on the surface. Here, heading like this. That's well within the 25-mile rules of engagement radius. Brian? Hello, sir, I've just sent you a second flash. What's she doing on the surface? Dropping reinforcements on the island, we think, sir. I've vectored up the two Wasps to support Wessex's attack. MAN: Dropping to 100,700. (RADIO STATIC) BRIAN: We're engaging now. The helicopters attacked with torpedoes and depth charges from this direction. It's amazing the sub stayed afloat. She was severely damaged and beached near Grytviken, here. The crew jumped into the water and were seen running along the coastline here looking for cover. Major Sheridan is preparing to storm ashore and attack while they're disorganised. - How many men has he got? - Seventy-five. - Against how many? - We don't know. Antrim and Plymouth will bombard suspect enemy positions here and here. And the assault will go in at 14:45 this afternoon. - Bombard? - Strictly military targets. Isn't it... Well, a bit of a gamble? Yes. It's a gamble. It'll be a bigger gamble to do nothing. - Agreed? - ALL: Hear, hear. (BOMBARDMENT ON RADIO) Forty-five minutes later, as our own troops advanced, the Argentinian flag was lowered and the garrison at Grytviken were assessed to have surrendered. Why didn't they mention there was no loss of life? That's so important. Could we go outside and read the wording of the signal to the press? No loss of life. Well, they may ask some pretty silly questions. Oh, tell them to rejoice. Just rejoice. About 180 prisoners were taken, who will all be returned to Argentina. This action, in no way, alters the Government's determination to do everything possible to achieve a negotiated settlement to the present crisis. We seek the implementation of the Security Council resolution and we seek it by peaceful means. Hear, hear. Mr Michael Foot. While sharing the Prime Minister's heartfelt relief that the operation was carried out without loss of life, the most important questions remain. How are we to pursue the search for a diplomatic settlement to which the Honourable Lady has just referred? Do the Argentines yet appreciate that if they refuse to negotiate, we will invade? - Mr Secretary. - Gentlemen. In light of Argentina's refusal to accept a compromise, the United States is ending its attempts at mediation. The President has ordered an immediate imposition of a wide range of economic sanctions against Argentina. Moreover, the United States will, as of now, respond positively to any requests by British forces for military assistance. Yes. And, gentlemen... Gentlemen, we must remember that the aggression was on the part of Argentina in this little dispute over... over that little bunch of ice-cold islands down there, and that's got to stop. You fly straight over there, Francis, and tell Haig exactly what we need. Do you think it's wise for me to leave my desk... Yes. - Yes. - Total exclusion zone. Attorney. Yes, Admiral Woodward's 12 warships enter the maritime exclusion zone today. It thereupon becomes a total exclusion zone, TEZ. Aircrafts as well as ships, irrespective of nationality, will be attacked if they attempt to enter it. Chief of Defence Staff, would you reiterate the object of this? It's a further tightening of the screw. Aerial and naval actions will be launched over the Falklands to draw the enemy into combat, before the arrival of our landing force. It should draw out their reserves. And in connection with that, Prime Minister, may 1 raise a point? Yes, of course. In addition to the total exclusion zone, 1 think it important that we promulgate a broader warning. Enemy ships and aircraft in any position will be attacked if they pose a threat to our forces. Well, that's more or less the same thing. No, with respect, they are two distinct things. Anything inside the total exclusion zone will be attacked. Anything outside may be attacked, without warning, if it threatens our forces. How would we inform them? Through the United Nations, as we inform them of everything. But if the Argies could sink one of our carriers, they'd go ahead and do it no matter where it was. So we'd be putting ourselves in the same footing as them. Yes, but we're doing it publicly and giving notice. - Agreed? - Yes. Hmm? Attorney, would you go ahead with that? Issue the warning. REPORTER ON TV The Secretary General believes a breakthrough is possible. An indication that matters may be reaching a critical stage, Britain's Ambassador, Sir Anthony Parsons, slipped in for his meeting with the Secretary General unobserved. I would like you immediately to convey the offer of the United Nations to both governments. - I'm sure my government will welcome it. - Speed is most important. I'm not sure how my government will view a further attempt to mediate. Not even by the United Nations? After the brutal and unprovoked attack on South Georgia. You invaded, not us. Aggression should not be allowed to succeed. The Argentines have sent in over 40 planes to attack your Sea Harriers and ships. Are you aware of that, to engage your fleet? Will you provide to us the assistance on that list? Of course we will. Of course. Meantime, I could get onto the government of Peru. They could take over Haig II. Maybe they'd listen to another Latin American country. Al, both sides have rejected Haig IL. Well, we gotta keep talking or the South Atlantic's gonna become a bloodbath. Come on. Come on. Telephones in Peru are still made from jungle creeper. - Hello, General Haig. - Good evening, Mr President. Um, 1 very much appreciate the chance to talk to you, sir. I have a seven-point conceptualisation I would like to put to you, sir, to end hostilities in the South Atlantic. - You put to me? - Exactly. Then perhaps your government, the Peruvian government, might consider putting the package to the Argentines. The Veinticinco de Mayo and her escorts moved down to here during the night. It's their main battle force. But how did they get past our nuclear subs? I don't know. You've spoken to Woodward? Yes, he's convinced it's a pincer movement. He wants Belgrano sunk. Pincer movement? The Belgrano and her escorts carrying Exocets could suddenly turn and steam hard north. The Veinticinco de Mayo could simultaneously steam south and launch her Skyhawk attack aircraft. Both our carriers would be caught between. - What's the answer? - Pick off one arm of the pincer. - Yes? - Congueror should sink Belgrano. Could such a decision wait until a pincer movement is actually started? No. Here's the Birdwood Bank of shallow water. If Belgrano turns north, she'll be over it very quickly. It's deep enough for her, but too shallow for our submarines to operate. The chance would have gone. Well, we've got a War Cabinet at 3:00. Can it wait till then? Conqueror sticks her aerial above the surface to receive signals at prearranged but irregular times. It's only up for a few seconds. The next such signal time is 55 minutes from now. After that, it will be too late. This must be ordered now, Prime Minister. Right, well, everyone's arriving for the big midday meeting. Let's round up the War Cabinet. - What about loss of life? - There are bound to be casualties, yes. She might only be disabled, but if she sank, the two escorts could rescue the ship's company. Those who survived. Are we absolutely certain that she's armed with Exocet? Not 100%, but there have been intelligence reports that she is. - We have to assume they're correct. - The two escorts certainly are. But this ship was outside the total exclusion zone. That's clearly covered by our warning of the 23rd of April. Anything outside it may be attacked, without warning, if it proves a threat. What about the direction the Belgrano is sailing in? It means nothing. She can change course in 30 seconds. The one thing she won't do is betray the course she'll be taking after the pincer is sprung until the last possible moment. - What's her complement? - About 1,000 men. Dear, dear God. The threat is clear. 1 think we have to consider the political implications. Well, there's bound to be tremendous world reaction. It's a major escalation of the fighting. But they've been trying to sink our ships, kill our boys. They invaded, not us. They attacked two of our ships by air yesterday. They claim to have seriously damaged Hermes and to have shot down 11 Harriers. It's quite clear, in my view, that Argentine commanders have instructions to sink our ships wherever they find them. I don't think we've any alternative. - Willie? - Iagree. Michael? I don't have enough information to offer an opinion. You said it would be clearly within our warning of the 23rd of April. Yes, it's clearly that. Well, suppose Conqueror kept shadowing her, if necessary, around the Birdwood Bank. She would almost certainly lose her. -(SIGHS) Well, in that case, 1 agree. - How quickly would this happen. The signal can go out now. Then it's up to Conqueror. It is feared that the loss of life may have been heavy. Our submarines did not attack the two escorting destroyers in the belief that they would assist survivors. Regrettably, the escorts rapidly removed themselves from the scene before picking up their own men in the water. The loss of life must be a matter of deep concern to this House, but our first duty must be the protection of our ships and our men. Hear, hear. The only way to stop the fighting is for the Argentines to withdraw their garrison in compliance with UN Resolution 502. The Government have direct responsibility in this matter. The right honourable lady especially so. Can she say that this terrible event is consistent with her statements about the minimum use of force? MP: Hear, hear. 1 would remind the right honourable gentleman of our warning to Argentina of the 23rd of April, made both directly and through the United Nations, that Argentine warships would be sunk if they constituted a direct threat to our forces whatever their position. Our prime duty and consideration must be towards our own men. Hear, hear. The worry I live with hourly is that attacking Argentine forces may now get through and sink some of our ships. Naturally, we wonder what effect this might have on the Peruvian peace plan. - Haig in a poncho. - Pardon me? Oh, that's what the Argentinians are calling it. Haig in a poncho. I like it. Actually, it's Haig II in a poncho. Well, Buenos Aires is continuing to negotiate. - Belgrano's made no difference to that. - That's for sure? They've just confirmed next week's schedule of meetings with Pérez de Cuéllar. Then maybe I should have one last try. Now, Mr Secretary... Maybe not me. Maybe you should go, Dick. Try talking to that bunch of drunken screwballs down there. We don't want them talking to the Soviets. - If you say so, sir. - Secretly, of course. There's no doubt about the effect on the Argentine Navy. Every one of their ships has scuttled back here, where the water is too shallow for our subs to operate. It's effectively neutralised their entire fleet. Thus probably saving lives. - Margaret? - Yes? Sorry. Attorney. The new total exclusion zone, leaving them a 12-mile strip down the coast, will effectively pin them in. (INTERCOM BUZZING) Yes. May the Defence Secretary see you urgently, Prime Minister? Yes. The Sheffield has been hit. We think by an Exocet. There may be a lot of casualties. The ship caught fire, which soon spread out of control. The order was given to abandon ship. Communications within the operational area are difficult at present. Next of kin will, of course, be informed as soon as we have information. I do not seek in any sense, in this moment of tragedy, to make any political comment. But 1 hope the government will make a full statement tomorrow so that we can debate the matter. Hear, hear. Mr Wells. One cannot help feeling that the Leader of the Opposition is a prize hypocrite. (MPs PROTESTING) It is the last chance. If we fail to get a deal on this, the UN proposals, a great many more people are going to be killed. General comments. Home Secretary? Well, it goes much further than it's gone before, abandoning sovereignty and agreeing to a United Nations governor? I'm aware of what it says. What is your position? Well, I suppose it's acceptable as a last-ditch try. It leaves many matters very vague, Prime Minister. Surely that is Pérez de Cuéllar's intention. Well, everything must be clear. Nobody must be left in the slightest doubt... For heaven's sake, we're trying... If you would allow me to finish, Prime Minister, 1 think you might agree with me. It's up to you and the War Cabinet to decide how far you are prepared to go. It's up to me to explain exactly what this says and fails to say. - If you will... - Shall we go through it point by point? You were very brave. She is quite the most wonderful and quite the most impossible human being I've ever come across. While she was talking, 1 kept remembering, "Little man, little man, 'must' is not a word to use to princes." Do you know she's written scores of letters in her own hand to the families of every single serviceman killed? And she'll go on doing that as long as the fighting lasts. There'll be quite a lot of letters. Yeah. It would be self-defeating madness to reject it. It's all there. - I don't know that I can... - Nicanor. It really constitutes everything Argentina wants. Accept it and you've won. It's not as simple as that. HAIG: If they reject it I could come up with another proposal. Al, we've been negotiating for six and a half weeks. The Argentines can't deliver, and the weather is finally closing down. But I can't seriously believe you'd invade. In three days? It'll take about an hour to explain the plan to the full Cabinet, from the landing here at San Carlos to the capture at Port Stanley. How much notice would you require? - For landing? - No, no, explaining this. It's all ready, Prime Minister. We haven't yet heard from the UN, you see. Could there be a last-minute agreement? - Where is the task force now? - Here, on full battle alert. Waiting for us. I have the Argentine reply. Perhaps you'd care to wait till the morning. You have it with you? Thank you. Dry martini. "Even sovereignty." I hope you have a clear conscience. Even sovereignty. (INTERCOM BUZZING) - Yes. - Can the Foreign Secretary see you? Oh, yes. Good evening, Prime Minister. - What time did the first troops go in? -3:40 this morning. Hmm, we shan't have any real news for some hours. 1 know. I'm not enjoying this, Francis. No, it's not a question of enjoying it, Prime Minister. It's... - It's just that it can't be right. - What can't be right? Trying to solve anything by warfare. It's appalling. - They invaded. - Yes, Prime Minister, I'm aware of that. What should we do? Lie down and let them trample all over those people? - What people? - The Falkland Islanders. The people they invaded. The people who desperately want to stay British. But do we have to settle this by actually going to war? Only one thing makes war justified and lawful, only one thing. When it's a struggle for law against force for people's laws, their language and way of life. Everything that makes them what they are against a brutal effort to impose on them a life, a language and laws which are not theirs and they do not want, when everything else has been tried and failed. If were are wrong to fight now, we were wrong to fight Hitler. We were wrong to fight the Kaiser. We were wrong to fight Napoleon. Wrong to fight Philip of Spain, wrong to do anything but throw in the towel and crumple before the first brute force to come along and abandon all the good and fine and splendid things that Britain's given the world through the centuries for a bleak totalitarian desert. Well, I just hope you're right. That's all. Prime Minister. REPORTER ON TV: The British batteries kept up a constant barrage, seeking out the enemy guns, laying fire on Argentine positions. A detailed statement will be made about our own casualties when next of kin have been informed. (MPs JEERING) REPORTER ON TV: Skyhawks, four or five, came low across the bay to bomb the two landing jets unloading men and supplies. We very much regret to announce that Lieutenant Colonel H Jones was killed in the action to take Goose Green. Order! Order! HMS Coventry, a destroyer, was hit and has been lost About 900 prisoners were taken by the battalion. (TELEPHONE RINGING) (TELEPHONE RINGING) - MAN: They've signed. - They've signed. (WHISPERING) 1 want you here. MP- 1 assure the House that there is no foundation at all in the rumours voiced... The Prime Minister. Mr Speaker, I will, with permission, make a short statement about the Falkland Islands. After successful attacks last night, General Moore decided to press forward. The Argentines retreated. Our forces reached the outskirts of Port Stanley. Large numbers of Argentine soldiers threw down their weapons. They are reported to be flying white flags over Port Stanley. (MPs CHEERING) Will the Prime Minister publish a full analysis of the cost in life, equipment and money of this tragic and unnecessary war, which the world knows very well will not provide an answer to the problems of the Falkland Islands. The right honourable gentleman calls it an unnecessary war. Tragic, it may have been, but may I point out to him, he would not enjoy the freedom of speech, which he puts to such excellent use, unless people had been prepared to fight for it. (MPs CHEERING)
