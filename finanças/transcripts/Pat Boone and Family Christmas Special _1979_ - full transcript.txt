[MUSIC - PAT BOONE, "IT'S OK TO BE A KID AT CHRISTMAS"] - Ladies and gentlemen, Pat Boone. [applause] - [SINGING] It's OK to be a kid at Christmas. To believe in love the way we did back then. Let your heart reach out. That's what it's all about. It's OK to be a kid again. Funny how the whole thing feels brand new. It always seems to take me by surprise. Some mistletoe, a Christmas song or two, and look at me! There's wonder in my eyes. It's OK to be a kid at Christmas, to believe in love the way we did back then. Let your heart reach out. That's what it's all about. It's OK to be a kid again. Sometimes don't you think that the world gets tired of grown-up things that happen every day? Yes, we do! Then Christmas comes to wrap the world in smiles and for a while to love the hurt away. If you have faith, if you believe, you can be a kid again most any Christmas Eve. So-- [knocking] [laughter] [applause] So let the season make a change in you, and don't you be surprised at what you find. You're going to have a younger point of view when you are in a Christmas state of mind. It's OK to be a kid at Christmas, to believe in love the way we did back then. Let your heart reach out. That's what it's all about. It's OK to be a kid again. It's great to be a kid again. So great to be a kid again! [applause] - Pat Boone and Family. A Christmas Special starring Pat Boone, Shirley Boone, with Cherry, Lindy, Laury, and Debby Boone. - With tonight's guest stars the Hudson Brothers. And special guest stars the Ropers, Norman Fell and Audra Lindley. Featuring Perry Lang as Joey the bartender, Yogi Bear and his friends. With special cameo appearances by Tom Bosley, Rosemary Clooney, Marty Ingels, Patty and Gavin MacLeod, and Dinah Shore. [applause] - Thank you very much. Merry Christmas. I really am excited about tonight, not just because of the show we have for you, although it's a beauty. It's just that there's always something special about the Christmas season, especially for the Boones, and especially for me. The fireplace, Christmas trees, Santa Claus, the reindeer, lots of snow, and that's just in my car. [laughter] No, there's something very special about this Christmas. We have a new addition to the Boone family. No, relax. No, I'm not a new father. No, I'm a new father-in-law. My daughter Debby was married this past year. [applause] I had very little to do with it. Let's see, that's Cherry, Lindy, Debby-- that makes three down, and one to stay. Fact is Debby's in the house right now with Shirley taking a few newlywed lessons. - Oh, that was such a great lunch, mom. - Oh, thanks, Deb. Boy, honey, it's just so nice to have you come and visit. - Mom, would you quit treating me like a guest? I'm still part of the family. Hey, how's everything going with the party? - Oh, fine. - Do you need any help with any of the food? - Oh, thanks, honey, but we're having it catered. - Catered? - Yeah. - That's a new one for us. - Well, this time is a little different. Daddy's invited a few friends. - How many? - 300. - 300? - Yeah, but mostly friends in the business. You know, they usually work during the holidays. And daddy just thought it would really be nice if we had our Christmas party early so we could share with them. - Yeah, but mom, 300 people! - Oh, I know. Daddy did say we'd probably have to add a leaf to the table. [laughter] - Hello, look who's here. - Hi, honey. - Hello, honey. Hi, Deb-o. - Hello. - Did you all have a good lunch? - A great lunch. - Looks like it. - We did but we had a little accident, honey. - An accident? - We broke your Snoopy mug. [laughter] What? - Oh well, I've got a $5.00 deductible on it. It's OK. [laughter] - Listen, I gotta go. I gotta do some shopping. See you later. - Already? - Yeah, I do. - Boy, thanks for coming, Deb. Come again anytime, honey. - OK, next time I'll bring my laundry. - Honey, any mail? - Oh, nothing much. Just a couple of bills, honey. - No replies to the party yet? - Not yet. But you know the mail's slow this time of year. - Yeah, yeah, I guess so. I'm just excited. Imagine all of our wonderful friends in show business. They're going to be part of our family this Christmas. - Do you really think they'll all come? I mean, you know they're very busy people. - Oh, sure they're busy, but you know how it is. The more famous people are, the lonelier they are. - You really think so? [doorbell chime] - I'll get it. Yes? - [SINGING] Hello, hello, hello! - Who are you? - [SINGING] I'm Bill. - [SINGING] I'm Mark. - [SINGING] I'm Brett. - Hi, we're the Tele-tunes. We deliver messages in song. Hey, where's the occupants of this residence? - Hello. - [SINGING] Hello, hello, hello! - Will you cut that out? I'm the occupant of this house. I'm Pat Boone. - You are? I'm so sorry. I thought he'd be a lot younger. - So did I. - I think he's got a face drop. - I agree. Let's see some ID. - ID? This is my house. You just walked in here. I'll give you some ID. [SINGING] April love. - Ah ha! I knew he wasn't Pat Boone. He's April Love. - Boone. - Boone. - [SINGING] April Boone. - Look, I don't know what your game is... I know what I'll do. Shirley, will you come here, please? - Yes, honey, do you want me? - Will you tell these guys who I am? - Did you forget again? [laughter] No, this is Pat Boone. - Oh! It is him! Pat Boone, idol of dozen! - Have you guys got a telegram for me or not? - Do we have a telegram? Do we? - Of course, we do. - Right here in your living room. Come on, Mrs. Boone. - That's right, Mr. Boone. Right here in your living room, we have the most stupendous, tremendous telegram ever sent. Bring in the fellas! - OK, fellas, let's set up! [music playing] [applause] - All of this for a singing telegram? - Hey, hey, this telegram ain't from anybody, Mr. April. - Boone. - Boone. - It's from him. - Him? Him who? - Let me give you a hint. [SINGING] Do-be-do-be-do. - I've got a telegram from the Doobie Brothers? - No, no, no, no, no, no. Wrong, uh-huh. This telegram is from Frank Sinatra. - Frank Sinatra, honey! Guys, don't start yet. Girls, come here quick. Quick. You're not going to believe this. Sit down. Oh, ho ho! [barks] - Watch it, watch it. Honey, aren't you glad we invited Frank Sinatra? Singing telegram. He's going to-- - Ready! Maestro, please! [music - the hudson brothers] - [SINGING] Here is a telegram specially for Pat Boone. Hot off the wire, hot off the wire. This telegram we will happily sing it to-- to the family Boone, our tele-tune sung by our choir. Telegram, telegram, telegram, telegram, telegram, telegram telegram. Here! Where? Telegram here. Telegram there. Telegram there. Telegram where? We have a telegram, we have a telegram, we have a telegram, telegram, mister, for you. Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Where'd it go? [laughter] - Oh! - What's so funny? - The Doobie Brothers. - [SINGING] I got the telegram. He got the telegram. I got the telegram. We got the telegram. We got the telegram. Singing for telegram. We got the telegram here in our hand, hey! We've got the wire. We'll sing it higher. You are the buyer. We've got the wire. We have got the wire. Got the wire! [gasps] [applause] - That was nice. Is that from Frank Sinatra? - No, that's how we warm up. - Well, what does it say? Is he coming to the party or not? - [SINGING] The answer's no. - Come on, fellas! [music playing] - Oh, honey. Don't feel bad. It's only one person. We still have 299 left to hear from. - That's what I'm afraid of. [laughter] [phone ring] - Hello? - Hi, Pat. This is Gavin MacLeod. - Hi, Gavin. Coming to the party? - Look, I want to thank you for the invitation. I just got it. I really appreciate it. But as you know, Love Boat's on hiatus for a while. And, well, Patti and I are going to take a real cruise. We won't be back 'til the 17th. - Oh, hey, that's OK. The party's on the 18th. - Oh. Well, another day at sea won't kill us. [laughter] - Yeah, bon voyage. - Here's the mail, daddy. - Don't tell me. More rejections? - OK, I won't tell you. - Tell me, tell me! - More rejections. - How many? - Daddy. - I'm a grown man, Cherry. I can take it. How many? - 42 more people turned us down. - Will you excuse me just a minute? Oh! [laughter] Only 42, huh? Shirley, look. - Oh, honey, I know. 42 more people turned us down. - So far. - I don't know what's happening. But I think I just got to unwind. I'm just going to go down the Milk Bar a while. - OK, honey. - I'll be back. - Pat! Why don't you invite Joey to the party? - Invite Joey? That kid down at the Milk Bar? Naive Joey? Can you imagine him feeling comfortable with all these showbiz folks? - Do you? - You're right. He might be good company for me. OK. [applause] - I just love Christmas cards, even this one I got from the post office. "We've enjoyed serving you this past year and look forward to serving you again in 1977." [laughter] But this one. This one from Audra just overwhelms me. [door knock] Come in. [applause] - Hi, Norm. - Hi, Aud. - Oh, hey, I see you got my Christmas card. - Yeah, I can't believe this message. It's so warm. I mean, I didn't know you felt this way about me. - Oh yeah, well, I thought you'd like it. - Like it? "Here's a Christmas present to my favorite boy. God bless and keep you, sweetheart. You are my pride and joy." And two bucks. [laughter] - Oh, dear me. I've made a terrible mistake. Oh, I'm sorry. - Don't feel bad. $2.00 is $2.00. You get what you can. [laughter] - No, I mean, I sent you my nephew's card. And I sent him a subscription to Playboy. And he's only 11. - Lucky kid. [laughter] - Hey, look, Norm, I came by to ask you what you're going to wear to the Boones' Christmas party. - I'm not going to do that thing. Are you kidding? When I'm ready for retirement, I'll go to a rest home. - Oh boy, are you making a mistake. This is going to be a really fun party. - Fun party with Pat Boone? May I remind you, Audra, that in the last Olympics he took the gold medal for boring. - OK, forget it. - His coat of arms is two loaves of white bread on a field of oatmeal. [laughter] - Are you through? - If he had a flag, it would be gray. - I guess not. - His birthstone is lint. - Stop. - His idol is Captain Kangaroo. - Enough! - All right, all right. It's just-- it's hard to stop making jokes about Pat's dullness. - Look, I am sick and tired of people making fun of Pat Boone just because he's nice. - Oh really? - Yeah. The least we can do is make an appearance. Every star in town has been invited to this thing. - I don't know, Audra. - Jacqueline Bisset. - I don't know. - Cheryl Ladd. - I don't know. - Cheryl Tiegs. - All right, I'll go. [laughter] Just doing this for you. [applause] - Well, hey, Merry Christmas and aloha. - Merry Christmas. - Mr. Boone! Oh boy! [phone ring] Hi. The phone, Mr. Boone. - Yeah, I thought so. - Hello? Oh. Yeah, well, I don't know. Mr. Boone, are you here? - Yeah, I believe I am. - That's funny. Yeah, he's here. Hold on, hold on. It's for you. - Oh, thanks, Joey. Hello? [applause] - Pat, Tom Bosley. - Hi, Tom, how are you? - Oh, fine, fine. Listen, I just had to call you. You know, every day I have lunch at the Paramount commissary with all the stars there. You know, Henry Winkler, Robin Williams, Ronnie Howard, Penny Marshall, the whole crowd. - I know. - And today I couldn't believe it! They were all talking about your Christmas party. - Really? - That's right. None of us are coming. [laughter] - Wonder if they all chipped in to make the call. [laughter] - So what's it going to be? The usual, Mr. Boone? - No, no, Joey. Today, I think you better make it low fat and orange juice. - A Harvey Wall-Booner? - Yeah. On the rocks. And leave the bottle. - Mr. Boone, you look like you're under a lot of pressure there. - Yeah. - Don't worry. Wide ties will come back. [laughter] - I didn't even know they left. No, it's not that. It's just the-- it's just the hassle of planning a big Christmas party. We're going to have a major party Friday. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - I love Christmas parties. - Yeah? - How many people are going to be there, Mr. Boone? - Oh, it's going to be a big party. I don't know, 200, 300. You know, Farrah Fawcett, Burt Reynolds, all those people, you know. In fact, when we were making out the guest list, Shirley and I decided we'd like to invite all the people that are close to us, you know-- - Yeah? - --in some way. And we'd love you to come. - Me, Mr. Boone? Me, Joey from the Milk Bar? - Yeah, keep me company. - Oh, Mr. Boone! Boy, what an honor! - I know. - Let me check my schedule. [laughter] It's Friday, Friday. OK. Oh, Mr. Boone, that's "Star Trek," "Gilligan's Island," and "Wild Kingdom." I don't know if I can make it. That's a big day. Can't you move it up a couple of days, huh? - Joey, you're going to turn me down to watch television? - Well, Mr. Boone, I was going to watch it at my parents' house. It's their anniversary. - Oh really. - Yeah, it's the second year they've had their television set. [laughter] - Is there a Bone here? A Bean? A Burned? A Bone? - Could it be a Boone? I'm Pat Boone. - No. Ha ha! That's-- no, just hold that a second. - Is this for me? - No, no, no, no. That's not. But this is. - All of that? - Yeah, there's two more. - Wait a minute. "Dear Pat, sorry I can't come to your Christmas party. Thanks, Perry Como." - And some of them don't even say thanks. [laughter] - Have you been reading my mail? - Oh no, no. You see, I couldn't help it. No, see, the envelopes are so thin-- the paper. You know, it's easy to see, right? And there's postcards, that's, you know-- Well, what's the difference, they all said no. - All of them? - Yeah. - That's a lot of rejections. - Yeah, well, you know, I tell you, though, you shouldn't feel bad. You know, I heard that Abraham Lincoln had difficulty getting people coming to his party, too. Did you know that? - Abraham Lincoln? You've been a mailman a long time. [laughter] - Hey, that's pretty good! Regular Milton Berle here. By the way, he's not coming either. [laughter] - I'm sorry about all that, Joey. I guess I better be going, too. - That's OK. - How much do I owe you? - Owe me, Mr. Boone? Owe me? It's the Christmas season. The drinks, they're on the house. - Oh, thanks, Joey. - Sure, any time. Tips aren't. [laughter] - Oh. Right. - And remember, Mr. Boone, it's the holiday. Gift-giving season. - Right, Joey. - Yeah. God bless you and your family, Mr. Boone. - You, too, Joey. - And may the new year bring a new hit record. - That's about all the goodwill I can afford, Joey. Merry Christmas. - Love you, love you, Mr. Boone. [applause] - ...group when we were in Hong Kong. They were doing a dance on a native drum with Chuck-- - Hello, Dinah. [applause] - Pat! It's Pat Boone. How nice. Well, this is a surprise. - Well, you know, I'm always glad to see you. - Thank you. - But I was in the neighborhood, and I just really wanted to stop in and invite you to our Christmas party. - Your Christmas party? - Yeah, yeah. - When is it going to be? - Next Friday night at 8:00. - Oh, can-- Friday night at 8:00? - Yeah. Friday at 8:00. - Can you believe that? What a coincidence. That is so funny. That's exactly when I was going to have my Christmas party, was at Friday night at 8:00. - You're having a Christmas party-- - Friday night at 8:00. Well, listen, I tell you what. When your party-- are you have a lot of people? - Oh yeah, I think so. A lot. - Well, I tell you, when all of them have left, why don't you just come on by, you know? We'll-- - Well, will yours still be going at 9:00? [laughter] - 9:00? Well, I don't know. They may have left by then. You come on by anyway. - Excuse me for butting in like this. - No, no. I'm just so glad. Pat Boone! [applause] - Hi, Laury. Something wrong? - Oh, nothing. Mom, I just broke up with Michael. - Oh no, honey. Too bad. It's not the end of the world. - That's easy for you to say. You have your date for the Christmas party. - I sure do. Every Christmas party. I married him. - Mom, it's just not that easy to find Mr. Perfect. - Laury, honey, I got news for you. Your daddy wasn't always a 10. - What? - Honey, no man's perfect in the beginning. It's like buying a house. No matter how beautiful it is, every wife wants to do her own remodeling. [MUSIC - SHIRLEY AND LAURY BOONE, "MARRY THE MAN TODAY"] [SINGING] At Wanamaker's and Saks and Klein's, a lesson I've been taught, you can't get alterations on a dress you haven't bought. At any vegetable market from Borneo to Rome, you mustn't squeeze a melon 'til you get the melon home. You simply gotta gamble. You get no guarantee. So why don't we just discuss it, you and I? You and me? - There's just some basic principles every girl should know. - Principles? - If you want interest. [SINGING] Marry the man today. - You're kidding. - [SINGING] Trouble though he may be. - And he would be. - [SINGING] Much as he likes to play. - He does. - [SINGING] Crazy and wild and free. Marry the man today rather than sigh in sorrow. Marry the man today and change his ways tomorrow. - I think I've got it. - [SINGING] Marry the man today. Marry the man today. Maybe he's leaving town. Maybe he's leaving town. Don't let him get away. Don't let him get away. Hurry and track him down. Counterattack him. And marry the man today. Give him your girlish laughter. Give him your hand today, and save the fist for after. Slowly introduce him to the better things. Respectable, conservative, and clean. Alice Cooper. Oh no. James Taylor. Maybe. Pat Boone. Now you got it. I thought so. But marry the man today. Handle it meek and gently. Marry the man today and train him subsequently. Carefully expose him to domestic life. And if he ever tries to stray from you, have a pot roast. Have a headache. Have a baby. Have two, four, six, eight, you better hurry. It's getting late. Marry the man today. I'll marry the man. Rather than sigh and sorrow. Marry the man today and change his ways, and change his ways, and change his ways, and change his ways, and change his ways, and change his ways tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. [applause] [phone ring] - I'll get it. Hello? - Pat, it's me, Rosie. - Rosie Greer! You coming to the party? - No, Rosemary Clooney. You know, your daughter's favorite mother-in-law. - I was just kidding, Rosie. Hey listen, [SINGING] come on to my house, my house, I'm going to give you everything. - Listen, Pat. I got your invitation, but [SINGING] I'm beginning to work a lot at Christmas. - Business before pleasure, huh? - [SINGING] And I could use the dough. - [SINGING] Well, I really am glad to hear it. - [SINGING] And I'll be there in spirit. Merry Christmas and a ho, ho, ho! - Bye, Rosie. - Bye-bye. [applause] - Ah, gee. - Look, Norman, I want you to promise me before we go in there that you won't tell any more jokes about Pat. - But, Audra, listen-- - No! Promise. No more shtick about boring, OK? - OK. I was just going to say that he's so boring that his pool's in the shape of a yawn. [laughter] All right, a promise is a promise. - Just get it through your head. Pat Boone is not boring. - Pat Boone is not boring. Pat Boone is not boring. [doorbell chimes] - Hi folks! Great to see you. - Well, hi, Pat. [snore] Norman! [LAUGHING] He's such a kidder. - Yeah, he's going to be the life of the party. Come on in. Let me take your coats. - Oh, thank you. - I'm really so glad you could make it. [laughter] Welcome. - Are-- are we early? I mean, we seem to be the only ones here. - We can come back later. - Oh no, no. Know what they say? Earlier you come, the longer you can stay. - In my entire life, I never heard anybody say that. [laughter] - Oh, what a lovely place you have here, Pat. - Thank you, thank you. - Oh, and look at these trophies. - Yeah. - "First prize for competitive water wading." - Oh that's just a joke. - Oh. - Yeah. - Look at this. "To Pat Boone, singles tennis champ." It's kind of small, isn't it? - Well, they give you a bigger one if you play against somebody. [laughter] - And you said this was a dull man. - All right, Aud, he got off one line. Is it OK if I sit down? - Well, you know your pants better than I do. [laughter] - OK, two lines. - Honey, the water wading team called and said practice has been canceled. - That's funny. Honey, look who's here. - Audra! - Shirley! Merry Christmas. - Hi, Shirle. - Aud, did-- Pat, did you offer them something to drink? - Ooh, ooh. Something to drink. - No, I haven't, but I will. Come on, it's a special recipe. Pat's Pink Passion. Just for Christmas. - Thank you. - OK, everybody. Get a cup. Chug-a-lug, everybody. [laughter] - Mmm, it's much stronger this year, honey. It's really got a kick to it. - Mmm-hmm. That's because I didn't just put milk in it this year. I spiked it with half-and-half. - Tastes like John Belushi's socks. [laughter] - Hi, everybody. - Hey, Lindy. Our daughter, Lindy, Norman, Audra. - Oh, Lindy! Merry Christmas. - Daddy, while you were out, Don Rickles called. - Oh, what did he say? - He said he can't come to the party. He said he had to take his snake to the dentist. [laughter] - He probably had an impacted fang. [laughter] - I gotta go. I'll see you. - OK, Lindy. - That's 298. - 298 what? - People. Pat invited 300 of his closest friends. And by some incredible coincidence, 298 couldn't make it. - Wait a minute. You mean you invited all those people, and we're the only ones who didn't have the courage to turn you down? [laughter] - Yeah, looks that way, Norm. But then look, we got the most important people of all right here, you two. And our family, of course. - That's sweet. Thank you. - Cheryl Ladd's not coming? - No. - Cheryl Tiegs? - No. - What about Jackie Bisset? - I forgot about him. [laughter] It's just the most incredible coincidence, everybody's busy. - Everybody but us. - Oh so what, Pat? This is going to be a fun evening. Now come on, everybody, let's go sit down. - Yeah, I'm enjoying it already. - Me, too. - I know what, honey. You can tell them the wonderful stories you tell about growing up in Tennessee. - You really think so? You think Norm and Audra would really like to-- well, maybe just a couple of best ones. Growing up there in Nashville, I just loved whittling. - Will you look at the time? - It's 7:45. - How did it get to be so late? - But you haven't had dinner. - That's true. Could you put it in a bag? I'll take it home. [laughter] - Well, I guess so. - Hold it, Pat. You don't have to get this man anything. - But, Audra-- - Sit! [tense music playing] These are difficult times. War, famine, violence. This man and this woman-- Pat and Shirley Boone-- exemplify everything that this country needs the most. Courage, honesty, and a sense of sharing. 298 people are that much poorer this night for not knowing the warmth and cheer of Pat Boone and his family. And I'm just so sorry I can't stay myself. [laughter] [applause] - Would you like to hear my Frank Sinatra impression? - I'm back! Come on, everybody. I was only joking! [applause] - Oh, you got us. - I fooled him. - You got us. [applause] [MUSIC - THE BOONE FAMILY, "WE'LL DRESS THE HOUSE"] - [SINGING] We'll dress the house with holly bright and streams of mistletoe. We'll trim the Christmas tree tonight and set the lights aglow. We'll wrap our gifts with ribbons gay and give them out on Christmas day. By everything we do and say, our gladness we will show. [MUSIC - PAT BOONE, "CHRISTMAS IS A COMIN'] - [SINGING] Christmas is a-comin' and the lights are on the tree. How's about a turkey leg for poor old me? If you haven't got a turkey leg, a turkey wing'll do. If you haven't got a turkey wing, may God bless you. God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you. If you haven't got a turkey wing, may God bless you. Christmas is a-comin' and the egg is in the nog. Please do let me sit around your old yule log. If you'd rather I didn't sit around, just stand around will do. If you'd rather I didn't stand around, may God bless you. God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you. If you'd rather I didn't stand around, may God bless you. If you haven't got a thing for me, may God bless you. [MUSIC - PAT AND SHIRLEY BOONE, "SILVER BELLS"] - [SINGING] Silver bells, silver bells, it's Christmas time - [SINGING] Silver bells, silver bells, it's Christmas time in the city. in the city. Ring-a-ling, hear them ring, soon it will be Christmas day. Ring-a-ling, hear them ring, soon it will be Christmas day. [MUSIC - THE BOONE SISTERS AND THE HUDSON BROTHERS, "CAROL OF THE BELLS"] - [SINGING] Hark how the bells, sweet silver bells, all seem to say, throw cares away. Christmas is here bringing good cheer to young and old, meek and the bold. Ding dong ding dong, that is their song with joyful ring loud caroling. Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas. Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas. On on they send, on without end. Their joyful tone to every home. Hark how the bells, sweet silver bells, all seem to say, throw cares away. [MUSIC - THE BOONE SISTERS, "O LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM"] - O, little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie. - O, little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie. - O, little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie. The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight. The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight. The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight. [MUSIC - PAT BOONE, "JOY TO THE WORLD"] - [SINGING] Joy to the world, the Lord has come. Let Earth receive her king. Let Earth receive her king. Let every heart prepare him room. And Heaven and nature sing, and heaven and nature sing, and heaven and heaven and nature sing. and heaven and heaven and nature sing. and heaven and heaven and nature sing. [applause] - Thanks, folks. Normally about here, we all thank you for watching our show. But tonight, for us anyway, it was really more than a show. It was a sharing. A sharing of the spirit of Christmas. We thank you for allowing us to share that with you. On behalf of Audra and Norman, Bill, Brett, Mark, Shirley, my whole family, I want to wish you and your family a very merry Christmas. And may you experience the peace, joy, and goodwill that's the essence of this special time of the year. ["silent night" playing] - [SINGING] Holy infant so tender and mild sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace. and mild sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace.
