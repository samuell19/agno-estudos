[blues music playing] ["Pers Lab" by Hotdog playing in Tagalog] [noise of traffic and children] -[driver] Good evening. Miss Jackie? -[Jackie] Yes. [woman on radio] Of all the things you've done to me... [phone ringing] Sir, take me to the bus station in Cubao. Cubao, ma'am? Traffic is really bad there. Does that have to be my fault? [Jackie] That's why I hate riding cabs. Every trip is all about complaints. I'm sorry about that, ma'am. As much as we want to bring you anywhere, we, cab drivers, are always at the losing end. Always helpless. Miss, I hope you won't get offended, but you look like a loser. [laughs] [Jackie] Lose? Did I really lose? Come to think of it, just like this trip, we can't really do anything. We are all helpless. You. Me. All of us. -Just like my change, all will be lost. -[driver] Thank you, ma'am. Ma'am? Your change? Ma'am, here's my card. In case you feel better and choose to return, just text me here. -Thanks. Take care. -[driver.] All right, ma'am. [bus honking] [woman] I don't care! -I demand a refund! -[ticket seller] The bus is not here yet. -No! This can't be! -I will file a complaint! [ticket seller] If you don't want to wait, then leave! -Go away! -Just give me my ticket! -I will file a complaint! -[ticket seller] Go ahead! -[in English] Next! -Going to Baguio. That's 150. You'll have to wait. There's no bus yet. [in English] Next! These people are such idiots! -[bus passengers chatting] -[in English] Next! [phone ringing] [ticket seller] Why are you only here now? I can't do anything about it... -Hello, Mom. -What now? Where are you? -Are you all right? Are you there? -Yes, I just arrived. I already called your Aunt. She was curious about the rush. What has gotten into you? I just told her to let you be. Just make sure you text her so she can fetch you. -Yes, Mom. -Take care of yourself, Jackie. Keep your bags close so it won't get snatched in case you fall asleep. And buy something to eat. Smile! Keep the good vibes. Love you! OK, Mom. [beeps] [woman] Miss, may I take this seat? Off to Baguio? -[in Taglish] What trip are you taking? -11:45. We're the same. See. [in Taglish] We're doing the same trip. [phone ringing] [snickers] Why don't you just block them? [in English] Boyfriend? You know how guys are. They will make you feel loved and promise to protect you no matter what happens. And when you've fallen in love, when you're ready to give the world to them, they'll just leave you. That prince will just leave you. Yet again, the princess is back to just hoping. You know what? All those fairy tales that we used to believe in? They weren't real after all. Prince Charming turns out to be Satanas. [scoffs] Kath. [short laugh] Jackie. [in Taglish] Going for a vacation? Or going home? Just visiting my aunt. [in English] New environment, new people. That way, it's easier to forget. Easier to move on. [heavy sigh] How about you? Why are you going to Baguio? To find myself. [in English] Soul searching. Wherever the wind takes me. Going through something? So, do you want to talk about Satanas? You sure about that? Of course! We're in hell anyway. [in English] Long story. [in Taglish] We have a lot of time. [Jackie] Ever since my mom made me believe that you should be aggressive when you like someone, I have gone all-out for it. A STORY OF FIRST LOVE It was an ordinary night as an ordinary student. On my way home from school, I rode the usual FX [in English] with my usual K-Pop oppa. Then, someone suddenly came in. He sat as if he owned the place with his enormous bag. [in Taglish] I wished could punch him. That's him. That's Satanas! But of course, he wasn't Satanas yet back then. His jaw... [in English] lips... [in English] eyes... and his sweat... smelled like heaven. -Miss? Miss, can you move a little? -[inaudible Korean host] -Miss? -Miss, wake up! [in English] Sorry. [indistinct happy noises] [dialing] [mobile calling] Guess who I sat with inside the FX? It's RJ! It's crazy! He really is quite unique! He's the only one that makes me feel this way. I mean, what is this? -[in English] This is destiny! This is it! -[cat shrieks] [humming happily] -Were they able to meet? -[man speaking Korean on TV] [Jackie's mom] Your timing is perfect! I just finished cooking. Let's eat! [Jackie's grandma] You're disturbing me. [Jackie] Mm! Is that really delicious? Or did you mix strange things again? Of course! It really tastes good! When did I ever fail? -Besides, I learned it online. -Really? By the way, someone called a while ago, a guy named RJ. He said you left your ID in the FX. [gasps] [Jackie] I didn't even know I'd left my ID. [in English] Speaking of destiny. -Did you get his number? -Here. Jackielyn, enough with your phone! You're at the dining table. -It's time to eat! -Nothing. No phone! -Getting mad again, Mom? -[Jackie's grandma] I'm not mad. [Jackie's mom and grandmother talking indistinctly] I AM JACKIE. That's why you got pregnant early. WE SAT BESIDE EACH OTHER IN THE FX Your grandchild is practically an adult. You haven't moved on yet? If Mom hadn't gotten pregnant, then I wouldn't be here! [in Taglish] You wouldn't have a smart and beautiful granddaughter. -Is that what you want? -[Jackie's mom in English] True! Mom, even if it's just the three of us, we're happy anyways. [in Taglish] We can actually be good endorsers of women empowerment. IT WAS MY MOM YOU TALKED TO [in English] Independent, strong, happy women! -[in English] True! -You're just hungry! Will you sit down and eat a lot? Because you've gotten really thin. -[Jackie's mom] Eat a lot! -Yes, I will! -But I'll serve you first, Mom! -[Jackie's grandma] Of course! [Jackie's mom] I know you got tired laughing while you were watching. -You disturbed me. -[Jackie's mom] Hey, you eat. -Yes. That's really delicious, Mom! -Delicious, you say? How come we had leftovers yesterday? [phone message alert] [romantic guitar music] THERE! NICE. SO, YOU KNOW ME. SORRY, JACKIE, FOR THE LATE REPLY. Ow! SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT YOU LOOKED TIRED [Jackie, laughing] Yeah! HEY, I'M NOT A SNOB BUT YOU LOOK CUTE IN YOUR SLEEP [Jackie scatting] IS THIS MINE NOW? [Jackie's mom] What happened? Being too flirty? [in Swardspeak] Why aren't you dressed yet? Wow, you're not dressed either. Fine! I'm going to get dressed now! [Jackie's grandma] I almost won in Scratch it! JACKIE, TEXT ME IF YOU'RE FREE LATER. Your grandchild acts that way because you are doing unnecessary things at the table. -Can you please respect the food! -All right! [in Taglish] But tomorrow, I'll win for sure! But it seems like someone else has won? Who are you texting? Is that RJ? [in Swardspeak] Boyfriend? [Jackie's mom] Based on that smile, it does seem like a boyfriend. [in Taglish] Grandma, we're just friends, OK? -[in Taglish] But we're getting there. -That fast? [in Taglish] Just go for it! Invite him. I'll cook some beef stew! [in Taglish] You're overreacting, Mom. We just met yesterday. [in Taglish] Go, fight for love! [in English] Go! Love, love, love! Your best friend was right. You should never have hoped. You're just as pessimistic as her. It's not that we are pessimistic. But there are some things that you simply shouldn't hope for. Something personal going on? Do you have a story to tell? Story or drama? [dramatic music] [Kath] The kind of emotion that pierces through you. The pain I felt when he said, [in English] "I need space." What a douchebag. I'd gotten used to him being around. Then suddenly, just like that, he was gone. He just left. As for me, I looked like a fool. [in Taglish] "Emo." Disgusting. But that's how it is. [in Taglish] I felt the bitterness of every tear I shed. [man] Miss, one ramen please. -[waitress] What else? -[man] Plus another one of this. All right. [sobbing] [dramatic music filters softly over earplugs] [sighs heavily] [in Taglish] Excuse me, miss. Mind if I share this table? What? -[man] Is it OK if I sit with you? -Go ahead. [distant cars honking] Are you OK? Just thinking of my ex-girlfriend. Same here. I miss my ex-boyfriend. So, you're crying over a guy you sat with in a ramen house? What about you? You cried over a guy you sat with in an FX. What? I didn't cry at that time. I was actually happy. Extremely happy. [in Taglish] There was something about that day. Something different. Something special. If it were a movie, [in Taglish] our first meeting would have been a musical. It was as if everyone around me knew that something big was about to happen. But I was just simply getting my ID back. But then I thought, was that all it was? [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music intensifies] [epic choral music] Jackie. -[woman] Is she crazy? -[RJ] Sorry about that. I know her. -[in English] Excuse me. -[in English] Sorry. -Jackie? -Ah. [man] What is she doing? -Jackie! -I'm really sorry. -It's all right. Here's your ID. -[Jackie] You should go back there. -I'm really sorry about before. -Take care! [romantic music playing] [in English] Let's go. Here. [mouths] Thank you. [waitress in Taglish] Hi, ma'am, sir! Welcome! [in English] Ah, yes. You know, this is one of my favorites. The food is delicious here. [waitress] What would you like to order? [Jackie] Something as delicious as you. Hey, thanks again. [in English] For what? [in Taglish] For giving back my ID and for the cheese tart. [in Taglish] Excuse me, the cheese tart's on you. [in Taglish] But don't worry, it's on me next time. [in Taglish] So, there's a next time? Of course. -Here's your order. -Why not? Here. Here it is. [in English] Thank you. [hesitating noises] Do you have a girlfriend? [laughs] Are you seriously asking me that? Yes. [in English] OK, fine! If you don't want to answer, I'll ask something else. -Uh... -Game. [in Taglish] What's your shoe size? -None. -Huh? [in Taglish] None? You don't have a shoe size? None, to your first question. [in Taglish] To your second question, I'm a size 10. ["Inday" by Juanita Romualdez playing in Taglish] [mouths] Oh my God! [happy screaming] [happy laughter] [Jackie] Since the day he returned my ID, we were inseparable. He would always fetch me from my house and accompany me to school. Then he would accompany me on the way back home. Every single day. Jackie, I want to ask you something. -What's that? -May I use your bathroom? Sure! Bathroom's inside the house. -You sure it's OK? -Of course. -This way. -Thank you. -[in English] Is he the one? -What? -Come here. -What? Aren't you going somewhere? No, I'll stay here! He's really handsome! -Lower your voice. He might hear you. -Mom, look, he's very handsome! Oh, no, I cooked beef stew for dinner! He should eat here! No way. -What's with you? -No way. [Jackie muttering] Mom? [RJ clears throat] Um... Mom, he just needed to use the rest room. [in Taglish] Good evening, ma'am. My dear, join us for dinner. I cooked some beef stew! It's my specialty. Psst! Sit! -So, what's the status between you two? -Huh? -Mom? -What? -You just need a little push. -Tomatoes? So, is it all right? What? It's a good thing you left your ID. Why is that? Well, had you not left it, [in Taglish] I would not have met my future girlfriend. [laughs in English] Present. What? [in English] Present girlfriend. [romantic music playing] [in Taglish] At least the two of you became a couple. How could you become a couple when you just met him that night? Unless you saw each other again? Well, that's just it. I was really confused. I couldn't stop thinking about my ex-boyfriend. -Hi, miss! -Bastard! STORY OF AN EMOTIONAL PERSON'S LOVE -Sorry, miss. -What the heck! -What? -[drunk man] I just want to talk to her. [man] Miss! Miss who kept crying while eating ramen. Look who's talking. Dan. [distant disco music] -OK! -[in English] Nice to meet you, Dan. Wait, I didn't get your name. And why would I give you my name? Aren't you aware of the Golden Rule? -What Golden Rule? -The Golden Rule of party boys and girls. That you shouldn't give your real name to people you just met in a bar. We're not in a bar. [in English] Fine! I'm Kath. Happy? Kath. Are you on your way home? Do you want some company? Guys might harass you again. [in Taglish] You know what, I don't really talk to strangers. That's why I'm introducing myself. You're quite annoying, you know? I can handle myself. This place, Tomas Morato, I can handle this! So, thanks. I'm good. If you say so. -[car honking] -[gasps] When he held my hand, it felt as if we were in a different world. I never thought he'd save me. All I knew was, he was holding my hand. Why are you smiling? You're crazy! I look good, don't I? Not really. So, are you heading home now? -Aren't your parents looking for you? -No. How about your boyfriend? Nice style, huh. [in Tagalog] Well, he just told me that he needs space. [in Tagalog] So, technically, I have nowhere to go. Isn't this the same guy you were crying about? Thanks for reminding me. [in Tagalog] He told me he needed space. So, nobody's looking for me. Parents. Boyfriend. Dog. [in English] I just want to go somewhere to find some peace and quiet. Let's go to Manila Bay. [in English] Let's watch the sunrise from there. You really are crazy. [in Taglish] There's no sunrise in Manila Bay. -[in Taglish] There's just sunset. -That's what I thought. You wanted somewhere peaceful, right? Then let's go to a cemetery. It's very peaceful there. [scoffs] Ha, ha, ha, funny! Hey, I was just kidding. Let's go! -Game? -[chuckles] Taxi! This jerk. He had some serious guts. Feeling handsome enough to ask me out just like that... And yet there I was, the fool who went with him, [in Taglish] even though I barely knew him. [in Taglish] It's all right. An adventure. It's amazing here! Had I known, I would have come earlier. Well, you're here now. [Dan chuckles] -Dan, I wanted to ask you something. -[clears throat] What's that? That night when we met at the restaurant, why were you crying? What happened to you and your ex-girlfriend? [chuckles] All right, let's see. [in English] Let's play a game. But if a question becomes too personal, we have the option to pass. And we only get one question per turn. -Are you OK with that? Game? -Game! -Game! OK. -So what... What happened to the two of you? OK. When you saw me back then, let's just say it was very recent. You still love her? [in English] What? [in Taglish] You ask a lot of questions. Let's just have some breakfast! [Kath] I know Dan isn't your real name. [Dan] How sure are you? [Kath] That's it! Now I'm absolutely sure that Dan is not your name. So, why did you do this? -[Alex] Do what? -[Kath] Why did you bring me here? I don't really have a reason. I just feel like you're fun to be with. [in English] So, my turn. OK. If there's anything you wish you could go back and change, what would that be and why? [Kath in Taglish] When my boyfriend asked for space, [in Taglish] I wish I hadn't pretended it was OK. That it was OK for him to leave. How about you, what would you change in your past? [sighs] I would go back to the day I met the girl who showed me how to love. But that won't ever happen again. What's your favorite food? -Caesar salad? -Seriously? Vegetables? -How boring. -I know right. [in English] Your turn. A while ago, you were asking me where I wanted to go. Your turn. Where do you want to go? ["Loco" by Itchyworms playing in Tagalog] -[Alex] Let's play again. -[Kath] Game! [Alex] What's the wildest thing you've done? [Kath] I kissed a stranger. -[Alex in English] Wild! -[Kath] How about you? -[Alex] Um, pass. -[Kath] That's unfair. -Tell me. -[Alex] Maybe this. [in English] A road trip with a girl I don't really know. Sir, please pull over. [in Taglish] They have the best beef marrow stew here. -[Kath] It could cause hypertension! -[Alex] Damn! Let's just relax! [in Taglish] You only live once, they say. "YOLO!" [shouts] Whoo! Whoo! Try it! [weak shout] [laughs] [shouts loudly] [in Taglish] Space your face! You think you're handsome? [in Taglish] I'll smack space in your face! You're nothing but space! ["Bukas Makalawa" by Sam Conception playing in Tagalog] [Kath] I can't explain how I felt. I found something I didn't expect. Someone who would make me forget. [Alex] Whatever it is you're feeling, let it all out. In time, you'll let go of everything. Am I the only one going through things? Don't we all want to move on from these feelings? That's true. Just let it all out. -All right? -All right! [owner in English] All right! You're the winner! [Kath] When I was with him, I felt better. I was happy. Everything was suddenly in place. [cheering and laughing] [in Taglish] But that was really fun! Though it's my first time. [both laugh] Are you sure no one's looking for you? Nobody's looking for me. You'll get used to it. Besides, my battery is flat. -I have a charger. -[gasps] -Really, you have a charger? -Mm-hm. Aww... That's perfect for my phone. -Let's try? -Who uses that phone? -[in Taglish] Wait. Excuse me, sir. -[in English] Yes, sir. Do you have a phone charger? My phone is an old model, sir. A charger that would fit that kind of phone. Yes, sir! I have one at the counter. -A charger for this phone, sir? -[in English] Yes, ma'am! -[chuckles] I told you. -I'll accompany you to the counter, ma'am. You're pretty lucky, you know? ["Bukas Makalawa" by Sam Conception continues playing in Tagalog] [phone beeping] [Kath] But as my phone rang, I felt confused again. I don't know if I was going to be happy receiving a phone call from my boyfriend. Or wish that he had never called. [in Taglish] I was already enjoying that moment. The sort of moment you wish would never end. [woman over PA] To those riding the 11:45 trip to Baguio, you can now board the bus. -Let's go. -[man] Go ahead! Straight ahead! Hurry up, so we'll arrive early tomorrow. [man] Baguio! Board now! We're about to leave! Wait, why do I feel you're confused? What, do you always know what you want? [sobs] Yes. I want him. I want him even if it makes me a fool. I admit. I'm also a fool. [Jackie] I was supposed to give him a gift. [in Taglish] I wanted to surprise him. [in Taglish] I was trying to be the perfect girlfriend. [in Taglish] Tolerant. Ever patient. Ever loving. [in English] And very understanding. [romantic music playing] [sipping] -Babe, where are you? -[RJ] I'm still here at my aunt's house. I see. I'll just wait for you here. Mom already left. I thought of waiting for you. Why don't you just head home? I'll just text you when I'm already home. Can we meet some other day? No, it's all right. I'll just stroll around here waiting. -[RJ] Jackie. Whatever. -I love... [sad piano music] I was hoping to meet with him. If you're a martyr, I am weak. [Miguel] Weren't you the one who wanted to talk? [in Taglish] I'm still here but I'm about to leave. [Kath] Yes, babe. Please wait. I'm on my way back to Manila. [in English] Please wait for me. [in English] Yeah. OK, fine. Go ahead. -[Kath] Sir, room 616. -[bellboy] Ma'am, sir advised me. -He just left. -[Kath] It's OK. I'll check it, anyway. [doorbell dings] [girl] Is that the pizza, Miguel? ["Ang Awit Natin" by Janine Tenoso playing in Tagalog] Miguel called. My boyfriend. He wants us to talk later at his place around 10:00 p.m. We need to go. Can I get your number? [in Taglish] Well, I might get a craving for Caesar salad one day. [in Taglish] In case you need it. [crying] [Dan] Kath. Did you see each other? I gave up. Why? Because of you. We just met today. You barely even know me. [in English] Hi. I'm Kathyln Rodriguez. [in English] Pass. I look like a fool. What? I said, I look like a fool! So what? -Do I look like a fool? Answer! -You're crazy, Jackie! Tell me! I want you to tell me I look like a fool. Because that's what you're making me. You made me wait the whole day, just for me to see you with another girl! Yes, you're a fool! Did I ask you to wait for me? Didn't I tell you to go home? [in English] Sorry. [in Taglish] The problem with you is you're too much in love. It's annoying. It's tiring. It's suffocating. [sobs] ["Ang Awit Natin" by Janine Tenoso playing in Tagalog] [silently crying out] [sobs] That's what happened to me. [bus conductor] Good evening, everyone. Some of you may want to grab some snacks. Because we are experiencing mechanical problems. But don't worry, we're already fixing them. -We're already fixing it. -Let's eat. [passenger] What kind of service is this? [bus conductor] We'll call you as soon as we're ready to go. Our mechanics are already there. They are already fixing the problem. So, that's possible. To have that kind of infatuation even if you just spent one day together? Did you call him? Did you message him? Did he respond? No response. [in Taglish] I guess there's no "happy ending". [laughing] What? [in Taglish] The Lord is trying to tell us we shouldn't believe in Satanas. Maybe we can still give this a chance, [in Taglish] to prove that there's true love. [powering noises] [chiming] [phone ringing] [Alex] If you read a book based on my story, the readers might find themselves just throwing it away. Because there's nothing interesting about me. I have no exciting backstory. No lessons to be learned. Nothing exciting really happens. I'm just an ordinary student who travels daily from south to north. [man] You can still fit there, it's an eight-seater. Every day is exactly the same. I listen to our professor's lecture. Then I go home at 5:00. I'm the type of student who sits at the back of the classroom, along with other weirdos. I'm quiet. Invisible. [in Taglish] Like I don't exist at all. I barely even talk. [in Taglish] In short, I'm boring. I don't have friends. Except for some classmates who want me as their group-mate just because I'm a good at drawing. Architecture. I took up that course because my father who is an architect told me to. I just obeyed. I don't have any talents. I can't sing or dance. I don't even do sports. I'm also not interested in things [in Taglish] that require me to interact with other people. In other words, I just like to stay at home. My room knows me better than anyone else. My room, this mess, knows every bit of my problems. [alarm ringing] Bye, Mom! [in Taglish] When it comes to love, I don't think I exist. If I'm invisible to my friends, how can a girl see me? But something happened. From the quiet world I knew to this boring life I live, everything started to change... -Shalee. -[laughing] [laughing] -I hate this. I wish I hadn't looked back. -So handsome! [Alex] Why does she take photos of people without their permission? [Shalee] Hey! What are you doing? And why did she even have to make fun of me? This strange world I had, where I used to live peacefully, got disturbed. [ceiling] What's the matter, Alex? A STORY OF TRUE LOVE It's Shalee. Oh, that girl, right? Shalee? She's the girl you've been stalking on Facebook. That's not true. I was only browsing when I stumbled on her. "Browsing"? Don't you look at all the photos in her page every single day? Will you stop it? [ceiling] What the heck did you do, Alex? [in Taglish] I destroyed the photo she took of me. Why would you do that? Why wouldn't I? Should I just let her have that photo of me looking like an idiot? Since when did you care about what others think? Fix it. Apologize to her. I don't want to. [ceiling] Then suit yourself. [sighs] [horror music] [gasps] [action music] Bye, Mom, Dad! Psst! What are you looking at? Nothing. [chuckles] What do you mean nothing? Why don't you go inside then? I left something. [sighs] Guard, he doesn't have his ID. Don't you see the sign? [in English] No ID, no entry. [camera shutter clicks] Hey, Alex! Alex! [laughs] Alex! Wait! Wait for me! [intense music] [vehicle honking] -[man] Miss, are you OK? -Hey. What are you doing? I ran after you. Why? I wanted you to have this. [snorts and laughing] You're the one who got hurt, and here you are laughing at me. I've known you for three years, that's the longest sentence you've ever said to me. Please stop. Calm down. OK? Don't we still have an exam? YOLO. Isn't that what they always say? [in English] "You only live once." I'm just living this day to the fullest. -What's with this day, anyway? -Not much. It's just that the weirdo in our classroom finally spoke to me. Whatever. Hey, Alex! I think my camera is broken. Then have it fixed. Where? Go to Hidalgo. All right. Where is that? It's in Quiapo. You will go with me, Alex. If it weren't for you, this wouldn't have happened. -[barker] Quiapo! -Excuse me, sir. OK, thank you! Miss, space is a bit tight. Yes. Sir, can you please move? -Sit back. -[barker] Quiapo! Better? [hopeful music] I think we can make this work. Just wait for a while. Take a seat. It's interesting to see this back in trend. [in Taglish] Digital cameras are very fleeting. [in English] Temporary. [in Taglish] You just keep on shooting. Then you erase photos instantly. But these cameras are like... [Shalee] They're like magic. [romantic music] [Alex] I'm Catholic, but I am not religious. Every time my family goes to church, I just stay in my room. If I'm not sleeping, I just keep staring at the ceiling. I know that God exists. But if He really does, He's just one more of those who doesn't really care about me. What are you praying for, Alex? Me? I don't pray. Me, I'm praying for my wish to be fulfilled. [sighs] I don't understand people like you. You keep on praying even if you don't get answers. Didn't God plan everything already? From the day we were born until we die. Because of hope, Alex. Hope is all I have. [in Taglish] Do you remember when I didn't attend school? Uh... Yes. You were on a vacation, right? [chuckles] Not really. It was just an excuse. [in Taglish] Alex, there's something wrong with my heart. [Alex] I didn't really know if I should believe her. If I were to choose, I hope it isn't true. Why are you still going to school? [sniffs] Thanks for the support. My heart needs to undergo surgery while my body can still handle it. [in Taglish] This is a major operation. [in Taglish] So I asked my parents for three months. [in Taglish] I want three months to live a normal life. I want to go to school. And then I told myself [in English] that I'm going to live that life for as long as I can. Stop talking like that, Shalee. [laughs, sniffles] -[bell tolling] -[in English] Speaking of normal life, I want to ask you a favor. [ceiling] Didn't I tell you? [in English] The less you care, the happier you will be. What kind of mess are you caught up in again, Alex? -[in Taglish] I don't have a choice. -[in Taglish] You have a choice, Alex. [in English] Go back to the old Alex. The one who doesn't care. [in Taglish] Why did you say yes? Can you stop lecturing me? Just tell me. How does one become a boyfriend? [happy music playing] Looking handsome. What's with the perfume? Are you courting someone? [upbeat music continues] This day is absolutely different. I can't believe it. Can't believe what? I feel like I'm no longer invisible. My parents started noticing me. My sister even told me I looked handsome today. Our classmates, they seem to be aware of my existence now. [in Taglish] They usually don't notice me. As if I don't exist. Alex, you're becoming talkative. [chuckles] In fairness. Besides, who ever told you that you didn't exist? What do you mean? You know what, sometimes we don't realize that we're the one closing the door on the people who want to be around us. We often think that the world is against us. And that we're all alone. But the truth is, we are the ones preventing the good things from entering our lives. [clicks] Was that OK?

I'm OK, Mom. [Shalee's mom] I know. I'm just making sure. Yes, Mom. You don't have to worry about anything. [Shalee's mom in Taglish] Just make sure you call us for any emergency. Yes, Mom. My sister, Anna, is a bit frank. So, don't be surprised. Meanwhile, my mom can be quite the detective. She tends to ask a lot of questions. My dad is not much of a talker. He usually looks pissed but he's really not. [in English] OK. I'll be OK. [in English] You'll be OK. Mom. How are you, dear? -[in English] So, how was your day? -[Shalee] It was fine. -Dad? -[glass shatters] [Alex's mom] Alex! It's Shalee! Alex! [pained rasps] [gasping] [pained rasps] [female nurse] She's only alive now because of life support. [in English] It will only be a matter of minutes. [in English] If we take it out, her brain will experience cellular death. [in English] And shortly, the organs will follow. [in English] I'm sorry. We did everything we can. [ECG flatlining] [Alex] A girl brought me here. She said, "You give people hope." I know this is the only time I came to You. And all my life, I've gotten used to doing things for myself. I learned to just go along with what others want. What You wanted. I have only reached out to You once. What did I do to deserve this? I asked for a little more time. Why do You have to be so selfish? [nostalgic, sad guitar music] [nostalgic, sad music continues] [Shalee] Psst. Alex! [chuckles] [in Taglish] Remember the first day I took your photo? I was laughing so hard while you were very angry. [Shalee laughing] [in Taglish] That was my favorite day. Hey, I don't want you crying. You're not handsome anymore. Go ahead. [Shalee laughs] But seriously, game! [in Taglish] From the church where you agreed to my request until you and I became inseparable in such a short period of time, you gave me everything I wished for. [laughs] Every single one of these photos, they gave me all the hope I needed. [chuckles] I'm sorry I wasn't able to tell you everything, Alex. But let this box tell you everything you need to know. Because I want to tell you how happy I was. All because of this. [laughs] Wherever this may take you, always remember that tomorrow when you wake up, I'd still be loving you. [Alex chuckles] [soft, hopeful music] [stronger, hopeful music] [Jackie] My cousin told me, even if love is uncertain, you'll still choose to believe in it. Because it makes you happy. Even though you know it could hurt, you won't regret anything. Because you were brave enough to try or fight for it. [Kath] That was really painful. I don't think I could take it if it happened to me. [both girls crying] [laughing and crying] But... [in Taglish] It's been almost a year since that happened. [in Taglish] I think he's slowly moving on. But it's really hard if you think about it. [both crying] [bus conductor] For those riding the last trip to Baguio, you can now board the bus. We are leaving for real. Chance passengers are to board later. Please leave the bus for now. -I'll just use the rest room. -I'll wait for you inside. [in Taglish] Sir, please inform me if you are able to find an extra seat. -OK. I'll let you know, sir. -OK. -Jackie! -Alex! -Wait, you're also going to Baguio? -Yes. But it looks like there are no more tickets available for the last trip. I was supposed to accompany a friend. ["Ang Awit Natin" by Janine Tenoso playing in Tagalog] Kath! He's the cousin I was telling you about, Alex. Alex, this is Kath. We became friends just now. [in Taglish] Alex, not Dan. Sorry, I was a coward. [clears throat] [in English] Excuse me. [laughs] Wait, isn't this your bus? This trip belongs to you. It's not yet my time. [sighs happily] -[in English] Thank you. -Thanks, too. [in English] After meeting Kath and Dan, [in English] I realized, you're never going to be ready. Some people win. Some people lose. But everyone learns. [driver] Are we all set, ma'am? [Jackie's mom] Where are you? Have you passed Tarlac? Have you already eaten? Skipped your meals again? Keep your bags near your lap-- Jackie? -I think I need some of your beef stew. -[Jackie's mom] Certainly. -I'm always here for you, OK? -I'm on my way home. ["Ang Awit Natin" by Janine Tenoso continues playing in Tagalog] FOR YOU FOR ME
