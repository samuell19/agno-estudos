You shouldn't be here. I've got nowhere else to go. You can't stay here. I've got nowhere else. It's not safe. Mum, please. Please. Hey, what's your name? Sorry? I said, what's your name? Nathaniel. I'm Rachel. Heard you playing guitar around here. It's really good. Oh, yeah. It's broken. Well, that's no good. What are you doing out here? Just got nowhere else to go. Do you wanna get lunch with us? This is Emily by the way. What are you guys eating? We're just trying to figure that out. Thinking Thai food? Thai food? Yeah. You like Thai? - Uh - hmm. Are you guys ready to order? Oh, just give us a second. Thank you. Anything catch your eye, Nathaniel? Yeah, gonna have this one. Great. I'll get the veggie Pad Thai. Thank you. So, Nathaniel. Tell us more about yourself. We wanna know everything. Well, I was born in the Philippines. And when I was seven, my dad, he was killed by a gang back there. So, I grew up with my mum over here in Australia. She's married someone else now. It wasn't exactly the best and I've been living on the streets ever since then. Pretty much. Anything else you wanna know? Sounds like you've been through a lot Well... We're really glad we've met you. And I'm glad you came to lunch with us. So, what do you wanna do, Nathaniel? What would you do if you could do anything? I'd probably become a doctor or something. I don't know. That's a good choice. What makes you wanna do that? I don't know. I guess, I've always wanted to know how to help people better? But, I don't know. Maybe in another life. Why not on this life? I didn't really have a choice about this life. Hey, Nathaniel... What are you doing this afternoon? I've some errands to run. Do you wanna come along? You know, this is a pretty great city. Maybe for some people. Yeah. A lot of people are lucky. Hey, Nathaniel. Where are you staying tonight? I have a few places I go. Sometimes there's some free places. Would you wanna stay at mine? I have a spare bed I usually take guests. Emily always let's me. You really want me to stay with you? I want you to have a safe place to stay. So, yeah. I mean... Yeah. That sounds really cool. Yeah? Should be fun. Come on. Make yourself at home. There's a couch and a view. The bathroom's just through there. And this is the living room. Hey! Yeah, yeah. Things are all good. Uh-huh. I just have a friend over at the moment. Can I give you a callback? Alright. Bye. Just in time. Can you chop up the carrots for me? You seem to eat a lot of Asian food. Yeah, mostly because it's the best vegetarian food. You're vegetarian? Yeah, mainly. Mainly... I just try to eat healthy. Good job, but I'll show you how. Yeah. So, what do you do? Uhm.. I study still. I'm doing a nursing degree at the Sydney Adventist Hospital. I work a bit on the side but my main passion's in helping people. So, whatever can get me into that would be great. That all sounds pretty cool. Yeah. It's really fun. Definitely a learning curve. Who's that? That's Paji. My sponsor child. He lives in Bangladesh. You have a sponsor child? Yeah. He's in year six and he really likes learning English. Wait, so you sponsor this kid, how much do you pay for all that? Oh, It's like, $30 a month. It's not much. It just helps with education and some other things. I'm just fortunate I can afford it. I mean, yeah. I don't know anyone else your age that would do that type of thing. Well, they're just missing out. It's one of the most rewarding things I do with my money. What song is that? It's an Australian artist, Geoff Bullock. Keep playing. Grab a guitar if you want. That was great. You're a really good guitarist. Thanks. But I'm still learning. I have a friend who teaches. Maybe? I like this song. Yeah. It's my favourite. Hey, Rachel. I don't have to sleep here if you don't want me to. I can go somewhere else. I have people over all the time. But I'll keep a lock on my door so, if you need me, just knock. What's the time? Almost 10. Sorry, did I wake you? So, what are your plans for today? Uhm.. I've got some work to do and a couple other things. You're welcome to come along if you'd like. Earn some money. Yeah, I'll just do whatever you're doing. You can come if you want. It'll only be an hour or two. Hey Em, how's your night? It was okay. Hey. Hi. So, how do you feel? I'm feeling good. Thanks. Yeah, it's good to feel fresh. How are you feeling today, Maria? It's Rachel. Brought you some of the stuff thought you'd like. You can share that with the others. Will I be seeing you at the shelter tomorrow? Yeah, yeah. Great. Until then. Do you know Maria? Yeah. She's beyond help, you know? Most of us are. I don't think you believe that. Hey! Do you have enough work for two helpers today? Hey, yeah. There's enough here for a few days that are boxing. Are you both here to help? - Uh - hmm. Okay, great. Well, you know what to do. Just have a look in those shelves over there and you should find what you need. Great! Thanks. Hey! And Rachel, thanks again for what you did the other day. You really saved us by coming in early. No worries, you would have done the same. So What are we even posting? It's advertisement for this program. Scholarship program. Okay. What is this program even about? Diet & lifestyle, healthy-living. Okay, so.. You've done this program? Yeah, and I really liked it. And how much is it? I think about $5 per night? Wait, how is it so cheap? Some programs aren't aren't about making money. Well, what else are they about? I guess, making friendships and teaching others about healthy-living. Huh. That sounds really good. Good work today, you guys. Thank you. There should be more work again on Sunday if you're interested. Wait, so not tomorrow? No Saturday? No, tomorrow you have the day off. Look at you. All out of bed and outside. How long have you been up? Oh, Rachel! So good to see you. Yes. I've been out a while waiting for you. Well, I hope you weren't waiting for too long. What's this? My birthday isn't for another six months. I know But that doesn't need for any occasion for presents. Rosie, I want you to meet someone very special to me. This is my friend, Nathaniel. Nathaniel, this is Rosie. Hi, it's nice to meet you. Rachel, how is the shelter going? It's been amazing. But we miss you there. I miss you too. There's nothing was done sitting alone doing nothing. It's been such a blessing to have you and then Nathaniel here with me. Of course. You know I love to visit. Plus, our plans for Christmas. I better be going. I have to take Nathaniel home. Plus, plan for some friends. But I'll see you next week? Thanks, Rachel. You're so kind. Who was that? Your grandma? Pretty much. No, she's an old friend of mine. Me and Rosie go way back. Yeah, she seems really nice. Yeah. She's the best. Hey, is Emily here? No, she texted to say she's out tonight. Do you ever go out? Not the places Emily goes. But I have a couple friends coming over here tonight. You're welcome to stay. Okay. There was this one time I had a... a musical performance so I... volunteered to do it In University... So, you were born in the Philippines? That's so cool. Ah, yeah, it's not as cool as it sounds. Well, what's the biggest difference between here and there? I guess, it's just the whole culture. People here have everything they could ever want. A lot of the people over there don't really have that much. Yeah, that's so sad. A few of the guys here are going to Cambodia at the end of the year. I hear it's pretty similar over there? Yeah, probably. Hey, I know Rachel has been having you stay at her place and she's happy to have you but I have a place for you with your own room that's not too far from here. If you wouldn't mind staying there with me. Thanks. I'll think about it. Yeah, there's no pressure. I just thought it might be a bit better conditions for you. Hey, I have a some questions about the talk we had tonight. Yeah, for sure. Well... I don't know where to really start. I don't think I believe in God like you guys. I just haven't seen him work in my life or anywhere really. So, how do you guys believe so much? Yeah. It's true. I can't ever walk in your shoes. And I can really only speak from my own experience. I think a lot of people talk the talk, but not many people walk the walk with their actions. All I know is what I see. And I see lives changed. People who were once so maliciously self-centered, they change. People with immense anger, it Goes away. Within each person, there seems to be this moral compass that says this is wrong or this is good. And I know for me, I.. Couldn't live my life without knowing that there's some form of purpose to it. You know, it's not enough for a lot of people to convince them to believe. But for others, it's more than enough. Yeah. I know what you mean. Yes, I've never met anyone like Rachel before. She just seems to give so much to others. Yeah. There's not a lot that I'm certain of, Nathaniel but I'm sure that Rachel is the real deal. She just really believes and you can see it in her life. I just wish there were more people like her. Is it okay if I stay here one more day? Yeah, of course. Now, music? Hey. Are you going somewhere? Yeah, I'm going out. Where are you going? Church. On Saturday? - Uh - huh. Can I come? Of course. Hey. Is everything okay with Emily? Really? All we can really do is just be there for her you know. She's still trying to figure out who she is. Leony! Hey, how are you doing? I've been good. This is Nathaniel. He's helping us out today. Hi, it's great to see you here. So, what we can do to help? There's some things that can be done in the kitchen. No, but I have a photo with them. No, I don't recognize any of the place but it was the best moment I've ever had. Need any help? No, it's alright. Pass me the lettuce. So, this is church? Pretty much. We prepare food for a lot of homeless people here. Some of the people who've been coming have been coming here for years. A lot of the kids don't have parents. That's pretty cool you guys do that. Well, if we don't, who will? Plus, it's actually a lot of fun. I'm just so thankful to have Rachel here every week to help set all of these up. And also for her new friend Nathaniel for all of his help this morning and everyone else. You guys make me feel so lucky to have a safe place to bring my kids to. So, how'd you go with the stuff the guy was saying today? It was alright. I don't know what I believe in though about all that stuff. Yeah, I didn't think a lot of people do. Well, it's okay. I want to know, like... I want to figure out what to believe in but... I don't know, Rachel... You... you believe in God, right? Nathaniel... I look around and I see the way people around me live their lives. Some live their lives in pursuit of money and recognition. Others, boyfriends and girlfriends, you know, that romantic high. Very few with their lives serving others. Helping those in need. Giving time to causes that don't affect them. I guess that's just what means the most to me. That's what believing in God means to me. I guess, you're right. I've just never thought about anything like that. Yeah, a lot of people don't. I've just, never met anyone like you before. And I've never met anyone like you. Come on in. So, you've got everything you need? Yeah. Thank you. Hey. Hey. You know, I've seen you before. Yeah. You were serving at this soup kitchen I was at. I've always wondered what kind of people volunteer at those places. And I'm glad that I've met you guys. Well, I'm glad I've met you too, Nathaniel. It's people like you that make the whole thing worth it. Hey, you want to grab a drink? No, thank you. You don't drink? Never have. Would you prefer if I did? No, no way. I like the way you are. Like, you don't dress and talk like other girls. It's a good thing. I just can't seem to do anything that doesn't have any value to me, I guess. All I wanna know is that I'm making a difference in the world. That I'm looking outside myself and helping others. I think you definitely do that. Thanks. How are you, Nathaniel? Are you okay? Yeah. I really am. That makes me really happy. I think we can both learn a lot from each other. You already taught me so much. Hey. Hey. Oh, do you wanna go away with some friends this weekend? Sure, where you guys heading? Just some beach. We're gonna take a bus. Cool. Sounds fun. Hey, why aren't you playing? I'm not the best at sports. It's okay. We're just having fun. Yeah. Growing up, I never really fit in at school. It's all right. Think a lot of kids struggle to fit in at school. Just funny because those kids turn into adults, and fitting in the adult world is kind of the same thing. Yeah, that's true. There anything on your mind? You have no idea. Yeah, that's why it's so interesting not knowing what people are really thinking. Do you think I'm a good person? Yeah, I really do. How long have we known each other now? Let's say a few weeks. We've come a long way. Think Mark is really taking you under his wing. Yeah, he's a good guy. Hey, Rachel. I really like you. Like, I think you're one of the most amazing people I have ever met. I don't even know how to say thank you for what you did for me. You don't have to thank me. I'm just glad I could help you. What do you think about love and feelings people have? Well, what does loving someone mean to you? I suppose... valuing their happiness over yours. Yeah, I like that description. You know, I struggle a lot to not love people. It's like, I've been given this gift that just makes me love and see people the same as me. When it comes to falling in love I don't know the first place to stop. 'Cause my heart is just so full of love for everyone. Not romantically inclined to any person. I just feel like there's more important things in my life right now. You know, it's something I will want when the time is right. For now, I'm content of where I am at. You know, I believe in life you get one person. One person to devote yourself entirely to... to invest in. I know a lot of people don't believe what I believe but, that's just me. I want one person. I'm waiting for that person to be right and then just know it is. You really view love as something much deeper than a feeling. Loving people is something we should do always. Loving and committing to one person requires a lot longer of a process of commitment and connection. Yeah. I actually kinda like that. Is there anything else you're thinking about? I don't know. I guess you've given me a lot to process. You've given me a lot to process too. Are you convinced God is real? I don't know. But I think more than I used to. Think we're all figuring out what we believe in. Nathaniel, I'm gonna go talk to Em now. You'll be alright here on your own? Yeah. I'll probably join in on the game later Just the person I was looking for. Can you try one of these for me? Yeah. This is vegetarian. Yeah. Do you like it? Really good. Have you seen that guy before? Which guy? The homeless guy. No. He looks to young to be on the streets. We should help him. That's right. He's already getting heaps of money. Hey, what's your name? Sorry? I said, what's your name? Uhm... Nathaniel. I'm Rachel. Heard you playing guitar around here It's really good. Oh, yeah. It's broken. Well, that's no good. What are you doing out here? I just got nowhere else to go. Do you wanna get lunch with us? This is Emily by the way. What are you guys eating? We're just trying to figure that out. Thinking Thai food? Thai food? Yeah. You like Thai? Are you guys ready to order? Oh, just give us a second. Thank you. Anything catch your eye, Nathaniel? Yeah. Gonna have this one. Great. I'll get the veggie Pad Thai. Thank you. So, Nathaniel. Tell us more about yourself. We wanna know everything. Well, I was born in the Philippines. And when I was seven, my dad, he was killed by a gang back there. So, I grew up with my mum over here in Australia. She's married someone else now. It wasn't exactly the best. And I've been living on the streets ever since then. Pretty much. Anything else you wanna know? Sounds like you've been through a lot Well... We're really glad we've met you. And I'm glad you came to lunch with us. Hey, can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah. - Thanks. Hey, I don't feel comfortable here. I think I'm gonna go. Oh, yeah that's fine, you go. Hey Em, how's your night? It's okay. Hey. Hi. Just a sec. Hey, you okay? Yeah. I just want to say thank you for letting me have Nathaniel stay last night. That's okay. I have people over all the time. You know, I'm always here for you, Em. I know. Hey, Em. Hey. Do you want any dinner? We're cooking. No thanks. How'd the other night with Sean go? Yeah, it was all right. Anything happened? You guys left together. No, nothing. I just went home. Well, that's good. I was thinking of seeing him later tonight. If that's okay with you. Yeah, sure. Hey, are you home? Can you wait up for me? Hey. Are you okay? What's happened? I don't know. I just keep doing the same stupid things. And my friends is stupid. I just don't feel anything. Don't be silly, of course, you do. Wasn't Sarah with you? No. She had other friends. You're gonna be okay, Em. Hey, how you feeling? Okay. You interested in an adventure today? Where to? Just out with some friends. Is this your first time out here? Yeah. I don't go out much. You should hang out with us more you always have such a good time I know, I just don't have time always. Nathaniel's staying with you guys now, isn't he? Yeah, he is. How do you guys do it? Always do such crazy things. I think it's more Rachel than me. But yeah, she's a good influence on me. I think she's a good influence on everyone. I'm surprised you've never asked her out before. No, I wouldn't dare do that to her. She deserves someone much more similar to her. Yeah. Can't wait to meet that guy. Hey, thanks for bringing me here. I really needed to get out. Is everything okay with Nathaniel? I think he's gonna be fine. What's the matter? Just not good enough... to always handle these situations. What do you mean? You're like the best person I know. Thanks, but still not perfect. - We're so different. - You and me. I don't even know how we get along. Emily, are you happy? No. Do you know why? I don't know. I just... I get caught up in all the little things. And I honestly, don't know what to do with my life. You're always giving everything you have to help people. Like those kids in Africa and everything. I don't know. I just, I can't be like that. It's not me. And it's not that I don't wanna be like you. I just... I don't have it in me. Do you think I'm selfish? I think most people are selfish. It's what comes to us naturally. Why aren't you selfish then? Why do you care so much? Em, you know why. I wake up everyday and I'm just so content. So grateful for the life I've been given. Do you really believe in God? God is everything to me, Em. I wouldn't be who I am without him. Pause. Thanks for looking after me, Nathaniel. Mum, don't worry about it. Are you off to work today? Yeah, I'll be there all day. And are you enjoying your time there? Yeah. I better get going. I'll see you later tonight, okay? Hey Derek. I got a pretty busy schedule. I'll see you when I can find a time already. Yeah, I'll call you later, okay? Alright, see you. What's up? I don't know, I guess, I just wanted to talk. Okay... What's on your mind? I don't think I've been the nicest to you. I know your Christian. And I know that's important to you. But I really just don't think about those things. I really just don't see God in my life. Or religion or anything to have any point. Do you really not believe in God, Em? I don't know. Then what do you believe in? Well I don't know if I believe in God. But I do know that you're the closest thing to a good person I've ever met. You know, it's not just me, Em. I prayed for you so much. I've seen God work in your life. Look at you, you're stronger than you've ever been. You're not the same person I used to know. Is that God, though? I can't see him. Rach, I'm trying. But I can't see him. I just see you. You see me? Yeah, I see you. Hey, Maria. Here. Hey, have you heard from Nathaniel? Haven't see him in a while. Hope he's okay. No, I haven't seen him. I've never seen you go after anyone as much as Nathaniel, Rach. I can't believe you just walked up to him that day. Yeah, it wasn't something I normally do. Just felt like it was right. I've got Charles and Maria who's still seeing him all the time. Plus, that trip to Zimbabwe you've got planned next year. Rach, I feel like you need a holiday. Yeah, maybe I'll take one with you sometime. Nathaniel, hey. Rachel's just inside, she'll be out in a second. How you going? I'm doing well. Yeah? It's so weird, we were just talking about you. Hopefully, good things? When was the last time I saw you? I went to a social Rachel had organized a few months ago. But I just felt like it was time to step away and do my own thing. And, yeah, I've been hanging out with Mark too. Yeah, it's good to have figured out for yourself what you're gonna do. You aren't Christian, are you, Emily? No, not really. Yeah, but Rachel, she fully believes in it all. I've never met someone like her. She just, gives constantly. Yeah. She's definitely a unique person. She's actually the best roommate. Does she make you believe in God more? Yeah, definitely. I mean, it's hard not to be influenced by her. She makes me wanna believe in something. You know, the first time I saw you, I just... didn't think you had any chance. Like, I was there with Rach and... she just saw the potential in you. Like she could see right to the core of who you really were as a person. I used to hate her bringing all those people to our house that I didn't think were normal or Cool enough to be near me. But she always prove me wrong. Those people always we're so grateful for everything she did. And people in my life who I thought all worth my time always seem to let me down. I just believe that there aren't many truly unselfish people out there. Like sure, there's good in people. But just purely, genuine, kind, selfless people are so rare. Can I ask you something then? Like, you see how happy Rachel is. The way she lives her life. She's always ready to drop anything for you. Why don't you want to be more like her? Yeah, of course, I want to be more like her. I just don't have it in me. What she does isn't normal. It's pretty crazy, actually. Hey! Hey. What are you doing here? It's so good to see you. I just finished work and thought I'd stop by and see what you guys were up to. We we're just heading out, actually, but you're welcome to join. We're just grabbing dinner. Thai food. Yeah, that sounds great.
