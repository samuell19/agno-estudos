He said four minutes precisely. Non, non, non. Quickly. Two perfect eggs this time, no? Ah. Hmm. Maybe. I blame the chicken. Why do hens lay eggs of different sizes? It's not you, mon ami. These are two perfectly good oeufs. Mr. Poirot... I've got three religions bent on riot. If you're going to perform one of your miracles, the time is now. Have the eggs. Allons-y! Poirot! Sorry for the, um... It is not the, uh... It is the imbalance of the... Right. That's better. Excuse me. Coming through. Make way, please. Excuse me. Please call for the accused. The rabbi... the priest... and the imam. It is like the old joke, yes? The rabbi, the priest, and the imam. Forgive me, I am Belgian. So, let us begin. In the Church of the Holy Sepulchre above us... three representatives meet under the supervision... of the Chief Inspector of Police to discuss a divided timetable for market use. One hour after this tense meeting... a priceless relic is found to be stolen. It is said, one of these three men has stolen it. The police find no pieces of evidence at all. I find one. On the meticulously well-kept wall of a fresco... a single crack from an indelicate climb... with a hard-soled shoe or perhaps a boot. So, ladies and gentlemen, we must ask... who stands to benefit from the crime. Our three holy men live humbly. They're thin-soled shoes poor. Sudden riches and rubies would be... too conspicuous, yes, to enjoy. They do not gain. At this point, we need an armed guard at the south gate. Thank you very much. No, the only one... who benefits from the theft and the unrest it causes... is a man whose office I had searched this morning... as I waited, I have to tell you, rather disappointedly upon my breakfast. Difficulty with eggs. You don't need to know this. A man who is paid lavishly to keep order in Jerusalem. I mean, of course, the Chief Inspector of the Police. A man who does not wish to lose a well-paid post... when there is discussion among the local peoples of self-governance... who does wear boots, and who, I believe, now does regret... inviting me to consult on this case. How dare you accuse me! Please, Sergeant... did you search the office as I asked? Uh, yes, sir. And did you find what I said you might? Uh, yes, sir. Just as you said. Merci. Halt! You need to deliver that, Captain. It should be through first thing in the morning. Very good, sir. Luggage is on board, sir. I won the right to escort you to your boat. To Stamboul, then? Will you be back to London straight off? I am tired, and I have earned myself a little holiday. I want to look at paintings and have too much time on my hands. You are staring. Does it stop? It's just... How did you know it was him, sir? From just a tiny crack on the wall. I have the advantage... I can only see the world as it should be. And when it is not, the imperfection stands out... like the nose in the middle of a face. It makes most of life unbearable. But it is useful in the detection of crime. But it's as though you see into their hearts and divine their true natures. And whatever people say, there is right, there is wrong. There is nothing in between. We must part here. Oh, no, sir, I'm to escort you on the ferry. Au revoir, mon capitaine. We must never meet again. Could you straighten your tie, please? Just a little. Yes. That is perfect. Final passengers, please! Oh, I'm sorry. Will be fixed soon. But, will it be fixed in time? We are working! I have a connection in Stamboul. Leaves tomorrow at seven. There's a very ill patient waiting for me in London. I am a doctor. Doctor. I am a doctor. I am shouting at you in English, and now I'm doing it louder and slower. Very silly, forgive me. May I help? Let me help. I know your mustache. From the papers. You're the detective, Hercules Poirot? Hercule Poirot. I do not slay the lions. Mademoiselle. Mary Debenham, monsieur. I'll forget a name but never a face. Not yours, anyway. You come from Baghdad? It's true. No detail escapes his notice. Your ticket. Ah. I might also ask you if you enjoyed your time there... as a governess? The chalk on your sleeve and the geography primer. A governess or a cartographer. I made my gamble. I always begin them with geography... and monster them till they have the world down cold. They may get lost in life... but I'll be damned if they don't know where they are. Well, our chains are free. Right on time. I feel so free out here on the water. I wish I could enjoy it. We should be out of this, Mary. Not now. When it's all over. When it's done. Then, nothing can touch us. Ah, my holiday begins here. I can see the soul of the city in these humble breads. The world insists on destruction, yet here... masterpieces are baked to order every day. Monsieur Poirot! Mohammed! Mohammed, my friend... you are an artist. Ah! My friend! Sorry. Here. Come, come. Don't mind us, we're just looking for a place to have a private argument. It should take some 20 minutes or so... at which point we will both come to an agreement, or at least I will. Monsieur Bouc! Poirot! In the kitchen? Well, of course, this man will sniff out a perfect pastry faster than he catches... a jewel thief. Mon ami! Now, I am no longer a policeman. I cannot bail you out when this goes badly, eh? This is my dear, old friend, the esteemed... Poirot, who I knew before the esteem. Hercule Poirot, this is... A prostitute. She is. I am. Bouc, you did not tell me you had famous friends. We're friends because I'm the only person who never asks him... any questions about his cases, because I don't care. And he never judges me for being a terrible person. Indeed you are. Madame, Bouc, please join me for a drink, yes? You only have me for an hour. I ride on the Orient Express at seven, official director business. Uncle pays me absurdly to stay onboard his gorgeous train... and far away from him... at the home office... consigned to wine and dine handsome officials for all eternity. There is an art to nepotism. And you are its Michelangelo! Mr. Poirot. Are you a prostitute as well? Certainly not. Is this man bothering you? He is about to. You are from the British consulate. I am, sir. It is the Kassner case. Why, yes. I was correct in certain predictions? Quite. I do not need to read the telegram. Oh, how fun. Did someone cheat, or die? Unfortunately, both. Someone has... interrupted my longing for rest. It appears that I must travel with you tonight, Bouc. Can you find me a cabin on the Orient Express? My friend... I may not be good for much, but I sure as hell can get you a bed on my train... in the dead of winter. Three days... free of care, concern or crime. You will love it. Mademoiselle, it has been a pleasure. Sir. Your luggage has been collected and your expenses paid. You will be met at Calais... and then escorted to Dover, and then by rail to London Victoria. I would like to formally express gratitude. Please, don't speak. You make it worse. Here's a tip for you, pal. Thank you, Mr. Marquez. I didn't even carry your luggage. Oh, I had a good week. We celebrate when fortune smiles, and we share the good fortune. Remember to say nice things about us Americans, huh? No! Hey, stop! Monsieur, bonsoir. For you, Mr. Ratchett, the best table in the house. Just here, sir. The very best table. No, I want that one. Hey, Masterman. You got everything? Kind of you to inquire, Mr. MacQueen. I do not make mistakes. Oh, my goodness! It's Count Andrenyi. Come, come, come. I saw you dance at the Monte Cristo. Could I take your photograph? Please, my face, no! Sorry. The Simplon Orient Express... with stops in Sofia, Niš, Belgrade, Vinkovci, Brod... with transfers to Bucharest, Zagreb, Trieste, Venezia, Milan, Lausanne... Dijon, Paris, Boulogne, Calais... with connection to Dover and London, leaves in fifteen minutes! This way, Michel! Precious cargo. I need a first-class compartment. Give special care to my friend, Michel. I want him pampered like a zoo panda. But Monsieur Bouc, we are fully booked. There's no space left. Then we make space. He can have the number eleven. The eleven is always kept open for official use. It's very comfortable. Eleven is taken. The Austrian professor booked it two days ago. There is not one first-class sleeper car on the whole train? Negative, sir. Second-class? There's no space left at all. Mademoiselle Debenham. Mr. Poirot, are you joining us? It depends who wins this debate. Have all the passengers arrived? All but one. Mr. Harris. "All passengers must check in "at least one half hour prior to time of departure... "or their seat may be forfeit." The half hour has passed. The seat is forfeit. Please take Monsieur Poirot's luggage to number three with Mr. MacQueen. Merci, Bouc. Enjoy, my friend. Welcome, sir. Merci. Number three is unlucky. Oh! Apologies, madame. I meant no disrespect. Well, you could try to mean a little. One thing about train travel, you're always knocking into somebody. It's wonderful. Though, I am looking forward to getting back. Travel is fine for spicy food, mosques, meeting men. But eventually, you just miss your own bed. I've been accused of husband hunting abroad. Well, I can't, in all honesty, deny it. I like my time alone, I do. But a lady has certain needs that deserve to be met if she has any money... and preferably, on a regular basis. Oh! Oh, my! Fire in the kitchen! Farewell, madame. Good evening. Bonsoir. Number nine. Good evening. Bonsoir, bonsoir. How you doing? Bonsoir. Oh. Excusez-moi. No, after you. Merci, merci. Ah number three. You are Mr. MacQueen? Yeah. I think you might have the wrong berth. Uh... Sorry, is there a problem sir? No, no problem. The train is full. I think that we are, how do you say... "bunkies." Really? I am equally disappointed in you. This is nice. Come along, darlings. No. No. This? Why am I not yet unpacked? Five minutes to departure. Final call for passengers! Shall we brush you? What the hell is taking them so long? Soon as we get out of here, have them make up the bed. It's already arranged, Mr. Ratchett. No, I want the bed made. And bring my Dictaphone. Dogs on the table. Most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life. Yes, sir. I want you to get MacQueen... and have him bring every receipt from the Milan sale. I want you to get it done. Yes, sir. I want you to get it done now. Did I say get it done now? Right away, sir. "Better watch yourself." Your coffee, Mr. Ratchett. Who did this? I can't say, sir. Good evening, Mrs. Hubbard. Hello there, Mr. Masterman. Well, hello. Eyes linger any longer, I'll have to charge rent. I'll pay. Mmm. Have another drink. Are you insulted? Hmm. Disappointed. Some men have a good look. All they have to do is... keep their mouth shut, and they can take home any prize they want. Still, the mouth opens. Is everything all right, Mrs. Hubbard? You have a strong intuition, I know. My second husband used to say just so. Hold that, it was my first. Yeah. Brightest man I ever met. Face like a turnip, but I loved that turnip. It was nice to talk. Good night. Monsieur Poirot? Entrez, Pierre Michel. Voilà. When you take supper... I will move Monsieur MacQueen into Monsieur Bouc's compartment. You travel first class, monsieur. Ah, impeccable. Merci. Bon appétit. ...and the eggs? Good afternoon. Ah, Mrs. Hubbard. Good afternoon. There we are. Compliments of the Orient Express. Thank you, Mr. Bouc. I am here for all of your needs. No, thank you. I do not drink. It does not agree with you? Sin does not agree with me. Vice is where the devil finds his darlings. We should no longer speak. Good afternoon. Monsieur. How about a apéritif? I regret I have an appointment with the director of the train. He was gonna leave anyway. Please, sir. Madame, madame. Madame, madame. All settled in? Ah, merci! As advertised. And yet, the best things on the train are not food. You know there's something about... a tangle of strangers pressed together for days on end, with nothing in common... but the need to go from one place to another... then never to see each other again. Boredom plus anonymity plus a... constant, gentle rocking. With your hobbies, you will never amount to anything. God, I hope so. Hmm. Order me the fish. Um, exchange grouper for sole, escarole for the potato, and... the beef sauce for the velouté. Garçon, that sounds superb. The same for me. The Princess Dragomiroff. You know, if I ever were to marry for money, I'd marry for that much money. I brushed Dalia this morning. No, you tortured my darling doggy. I asked you to brush her. Are you still enjoying your Dickens? Very much, mon ami. You know, with your books and your capers, you are missing out on romance. Romance never goes unpunished. There was, uh... There was someone once. I would prefer, in the future, to be sat not with that man. Like should be seated with like. We are not alike. Not all of us are so concerned with the separateness of races, Professor. It is out of respect for all kinds that I prefer to keep them separate. To mix your red wine and the white would be to ruin them both. I like a good rosé. Hey, how you doing? Would you mind... if I joined you? Dessert is an indulgence... and I feel kinda silly and stupid indulging alone. I am at my happiest alone. But... for a small piece of your fragelité, please join me. Oh, with pleasure. Excuse me, another fork? I've been trying to make your acquaintance, Mr. Poirot. Merci. I never ever sat so close to fame before. No, I tell a lie. Once, I was on a bus with Ty Cobb. Ball player, Detroit. Ah. Would you mind if I have the little curly bit at the top? You're an odd bird there. You're a strange, peculiar man. I am of an age where I know what I like and what I do not like. What I like, I enjoy enormously. What I dislike, I cannot abide. For instance, the temporary pleasantries before what is determined to be a business discussion. You're fun. All right. I would like to offer you a job. "The avenger of the innocent." It's what they call you in the papers. And you are an innocent? I'm a businessman. I'm an art dealer. I mean, I'm new to it. But my beginner's luck has panned out. Relics, antiquities. Rugs, weird. Orientals. I'm new to the game, so I got the amateur eyeball. But I got a little problem with these, uh... so-called appraisers. You can't trust a one of 'em. Some of my customers... they buy a piece... they find out that they're not exactly original... which is hardly my fault... if a Kashan silk scarf is a fake. Right? Huh? C'est bon. But I've managed to make a few enemies, is the thing. I got a few letters, people making threats. I think, most likely, it's the Italians. I sold them a set of Oriental carpets in Milan. And the buyers weren't so happy with the provenance. And they want their money back with interest, you know? Italians. A guinea's a guinea. And then comes along the genius detective. Me? Yes, you. Hercules Poirot. Hercule. Um... Here's what I'd like to do. I would like to hire you to watch my back... until I get someplace safe. It's easy money for you. And it's peace of mind for me, you know? I understand. Good. I refuse. I'm sorry? That's bad. Maybe I didn't make myself clear enough. You see, someone's out to get me. And I know I'm not the best guy born, not by a long shot. And if there's a world after this one, I will face judgment just like you. But... I ain't in no goddamn rush to do it. You're holding a gun on me? No. Not you. On the world. I exist in the world. Do not point a gun at me. How's ten thousand sound for a week? It's a generous offer, Mr. Ratchett. I must decline. Fifteen thousand? You didn't hear me. I decline. Oh, I get it. It's not flashy enough for the great Hercules Poirot, huh? No flashbulbs... You sell fakes to gangsters. You're suffering the consequences. I detect criminals. I do not protect them. So you say "no" to my dirty money. I say "no" to you, Mr. Ratchett. Business with the gun, right? Is that what it was? It is far more personal than that. I do not like your face. If you will excuse me. You liked my cake, didn't you? The cake was excellent. Have a pleasant afternoon, Mr. Ratchett. Thank you. Ooh! Cold. Hmm. My sweet Katherine. My love. Mr. Dickens. Mr. Ratchett? Mr. Ratchett? It's nothing. Very good sir. Good night. Mrs. Hubbard? It's always Mrs. Hubbard. Mrs. Hubbard. Did we die? Ladies and gentlemen, the train has been derailed. Are you all right, Mr. Marquez? I'm fine. Thank you. You'll be safest in your cabins. Mr. Bouc will speak to you all... in the morning. Please, you will be safest in your cabins. Of course. Are we gonna die? Oh... My Katherine. My beautiful... Ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid that our train is still unable to go anywhere. Yeah, except down. How long are we supposed to just sit here? Yes, someone must be doing something. Of course I am doing something. I am doing nothing. Precisely two hours and ten minutes ago, when we did not arrive in Brod as scheduled... the station master will have surmised our situation... and already dispatched a team to excavate the engine... clear our path, and send us on our way. Until then, I assure you... we will all be made warm and fed and comfortable. We could walk. We could die of exposure trying. I have a connection to make. My boat sails day after tomorrow from France. Without you, I'd wager. Or me in London. I hold you accountable for my loss of time, Mr. Bouc. Madam, you cannot hold me accountable for the weather. Of course I can. You're the one here. And my conference in Turin? And I was to meet at the auto factory in Sochaux. Yes, some things, they are in God's hands. It is not for us to say... if we deserve to arrive safely at our destination... or if, like Lucifer, we must fall. Breakfast for you, Mr. Ratchett. Ah, Bonjour, Mr. Masterman. There is a problem? I can't say, sir. Mr. Ratchett? Excuse me. That is cold air. Please bring Monsieur Bouc immediately, and also Dr. Arbuthnot. Good God! Touch nothing else, only the body. My God, this is horrible. First the snow, now... I'll have to meet with the police and make some statement in some grimy station. And a man has died. And a man has died. He was stabbed. Long, straight-edged knife. Multiple stab wounds, some shallow, some cut clean through muscle. Left-hand side or right-hand side? That's the thing. It appears the killer maybe closed his eyes and struck blind. Can you estimate the time of death? It's hard to say with the window open... but my best guess is between midnight and 2:00. But no one went in his compartment then. I sat in my seat all night. I would have seen if someone went in. It's impossible. Thank you, Doctor. Please, return to the dining car. Michel, secure this carriage. Poirot. I need your help, my friend. You have to find who did this. Please, I implore you, on behalf of the Orient Express. When the police arrive, we can present them with the case closed. You are the only one who can save me. Your faith touches me, mon cher. But I must have this rest. Well, think of it as a little beachside puzzle. That's nothing to your mind! You look up the antecedents of the passengers. You establish their bona fides. Then you do what you do. You... You... You... You sit in a chair and you eat your cake... and you think until the solution presents itself. What else are you going to do while we sit here in the snow? Without constant stimulation, your little gray cells will starve and die. You think that is what I do? I sit in a chair... and I have a little piece of cake, and then I come up with a great idea? I don't know what you do. I have my Dickens. Damn your Dickens! If we leave this to the police, they will choose a culprit... right or wrong, and they will hang him. Most probably Mr. Marquez... for no other reason than his name is Marquez. Or Dr. Arbuthnot for the color of his skin. You are the only one who can bring justice. Let me have a map of this coach. Of course. Every passport. Anything. Interviews arranged with all of our passengers. Evidence, order and method, until one culprit emerges. I do not approve of murder, my friend. Every day, we meet people the world could do better without... yet we do not kill them. We must be better than the beasts. So let us find this killer. What's going on? Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to, um... It appears that our bad luck has worsened. That is... A passenger has died on the train. Monsieur Ratchett. Looks like they got him after all. You assume he was killed? No, no. I just mean he was in perfectly good health. He had his enemies, that's all. Indeed, he did. He was murdered. Good God. Murder, here? Alas, madame. God rest his soul. Someone was rummaging around my cabin in the middle of the night. Nobody would believe me. What is going on? As we are snowbound, I have elected to take the case... and find for my friend, Monsieur Bouc, the criminal. And why you? My name is Hercule Poirot... and I am probably the greatest detective in the world. I will speak to all of you in time. For the moment... I must recommend that you remain in your compartments with the doors locked. I feel like a prisoner here. It is for your own safety. If there was a murder... then there was a murderer. The murderer is with us... on the train, now. The doors between coaches were locked at night, hmm? Absolutely. Done myself. The train's been searched. There's no one hiding on it or under it. We can therefore limit our investigation to the occupants of the Calais coach. Bouc, you will assist me. As the only traveler who slept in another coach... you are the only one who is not a suspect. Mr. MacQueen, is this really the time for drinking? My boss is dead. I'm out of a job, and you're looking at me like I did it. We make no accusations. You knew him, so from here we must glean the essential facts. Were you his relative? No, his secretary. Book his travel, order his steaks. The man ate more steak than I've ever seen in my entire life. He was in antiques. He had no qualification for it, not the eye or the languages. Truth is, he had no head for business, accounting... none of it. I took care of everything. How long were you in his employ? Twenty days shy of a year. Prohibition wasn't to my taste... so I found myself overseas, and in debt. I'm a lawyer by education... not disposition. I was downright awful at it. You were fond of him? I was fond of his money. Ratchett was crude... demanding, insulting, and most likely a felon. When did you last see him? It must have been just after 10:00. He called me in to go over our sales in Italy. Milan, the sale of forgeries? Yeah, yeah. He wanted to look over the accounts. I had to translate everything... as the contracts were in French and he didn't speak a word. And when we stopped at Vinkovci... I struck up a chat with the colored doctor, Arbuthnot. And we had a couple of drinks, stretched our legs. He had some... odd opinions about Stalin I had to turn around. I don't hold a man's race against him, but I don't often take to Britishers. When did your party end? He left just after 2:00. Did you know of any specific enemies Ratchett might have had? Gosh. Pick a number. He confided he had been threatened? He got a couple of nasty letters. I have them if you like. Some, anyway. He tore up the rest. Threw them into the fire. That's them. Merci, Mr. MacQueen. Uh, thank you. If we have any further questions, we will call for you again. Have you considered the Latin man? Marquez. Hell of a guy. And, well, you know, his kind... they don't have the same distaste for murder, historically speaking. You said you don't hold a man's race against him. I suppose... depends on the race. And he was doing so well. You think it's MacQueen? Too early to say. I admit, I cannot see him stabbing a man twelve times in a frenzy. Not sober, anyway. Who did it then? I do not know yet. It is time we ask. Ask who? The victim. He has twelve stab wounds and, as Arbuthnot said, they are patternless. If the doctor is guilty... he certainly did not let it influence his responsibilities. Hey, the watch. Stopped at 1:15. Now that agrees with the doctor on the time of death. Hmm. It is possible, yes. Certainly possible. I don't quite understand. I do not understand, myself. I understand nothing at all. If you look at these two wounds... they are powerful and deep, and yet there is little blood. But this was a frenzied attack. Lashing here and there. No pattern at all, just extreme violence. And during all this, our victim, vigorous and anxious and full of coffee... merely lies still and accepts death without struggle... when he also has here... the means by which he might defend himself. For you. Now, let us see here. Barbital. The Mickey slipped. Drugged him so he couldn't use this. And later around here, a lady's handkerchief. An objet de luxe, handmade. Boom, two hundred francs in Paris. And she even has an initial, "H." And our little friend, the pipe cleaner. Another clue. Yes, a riot of clues dropped most conveniently. Yet only one appears, however, to be perhaps genuine. And maybe this ashtray provides the accidental breadcrumb. A charred fragment of a note. An attempt, perhaps, to burn evidence. Merci, monsieur. We may borrow your equipment, yes? Thank you. Merci, merci. Now, I prefer to understand... why a clue is left rather than what the object is. We seek the truth from within, not without. In this case, however, I may welcome a little scientific assistance. You will adjust the flame. It's just another one of those nasty letters. You are mistaken, mon ami. This one has a secret to tell. Look. "As a strong blood is on hand, you will die." What does this mean? Come with me, Bouc. Let us fill in the gaps. This was never a beachside puzzle. I know the dead man's real name. It is not Ratchett, but Cassetti. I know that name. Then you will also know the name Armstrong. The Armstrong case? The story shocked the world. Two years ago... the renowned pilot, Colonel John Armstrong... and his wife, Sonia, woke to find their only child, little Daisy... taken from her crib as she slept. Desperate... the Armstrongs paid the ransom. But soon after, Daisy was found murdered by... Ratchett, who was Cassetti. Sonia Armstrong was with child when she received the news. The shock sent her into premature labor. Neither she nor her baby survived. How do you know this, Poirot? Because John Armstrong told me so himself. He wrote to me to ask me for my help. By the time I received his letter... it was too late. He was found dead of a gunshot wound. Self-inflicted. "Daisy Armstrong's blood is on your hands. "You will die for it." Indeed, you did. Monsieur Poirot? Yes, Michel. Mrs. Hubbard wants to speak to you. I held her as best as I could. Ah, Mrs. Hubbard, I'm sorry to have kept you. You have a head full of steam and a mouth full of words. You're goddamn right, I do. What I have been trying... to tell you all day. The murderer was in my compartment last night. I thought I'd be killed. Turns out I might have been... only he got Ratchett instead. I woke up in the dark, and I knew there was a man in my room. You are certain it was a man? I know what it feels like to have a man in my bedroom. I told your conductor, and he wouldn't believe me. I said, "Check the communication door "between my room and Ratchett's. "He must have left through there." Sure enough, it was unbolted. I know I locked it... after what Ratchett said. He made a rather overt overture. Have you perhaps... heard of the Armstrong kidnapping? You couldn't avoid it. Morbid stuff. The child's murderer, Cassetti... died last night. Ratchett was the man. I told you, I knew he was a rotten one. You do believe me... about the man in my room? I'm aware you think I'm a silly woman. But I have proof it's true. It is from the uniform... of an Orient Express conductor... but it might have fallen from Michel's when he was in your room. I'm not missing any. I found it at the foot of my bed, on the cover... right where I slept. What do you call that? I call it evidence. Thank you so much, Mrs. Hubbard. Have you ever been to America? Once. Years ago, briefly. For what purpose? To confirm a suspicion. Which was? That I wouldn't like it. I was offered a post in Boston. Saw Boston, went straight back to London. Is that where Ratchett was from? Boston? I can't says
