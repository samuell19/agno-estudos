Advertise! Based on a play - Good evening! - Ev'ning! That nice bit of sun of yours has gone for the day, Ambrose! Hullo... Mr Miller! What filthy weather! So this play will close... So I guess you'll be doing heavy advertising on the next one! Would it do well at 'The Royal'? Why? You're a walking advertisement for it, in your top hat and tails! Russian caviar and champagne! Give me a hot-dog! Like one? No thanks, I'm having dinner. Do you think about anything apart from PR and advertising? I was born to fool with advertising, like you fool with beautiful women. Henry! Hello, Darling... Have you been waiting long? You sweetheart... thanks for the flowers! Damned good! That'd make a great ad. - Ambrose! - What? Thanks for the publicity you did. Shame no one came to the play! But no doubt we'll see you again. I hope so. Do you have something for me, Mr Miller? Unfortunately, Dad's company hates any advertising. Tell your dad that hell will freeze over, before I'll buy his soap. Bye bye Ambrose! Drive carefully! Wouldn't a car crash be good publicity? Won't help no that the play has closed. Come along and join us for dinner! That is, if you dare, of course... Alright... why not? Go on, hop in! You really were a great pal! Really! There... keep the change! Well I must be off.. I've a busy day tomorrow. I thought you didn't have anything on. Busy lazing around! I'm afraid I have to ask you to be so good as to pay cash. What are you talking about? Do you know who I am? My father is Miller, the soap company head! He has usually paid.... And so? He's told us that we're not to put anything on account any longer. Is it not rather tactless to make such an announcement so public? Don't complain to us... speak to your father. Hi there, Henry! Good evening! May I have this dance? Can Mr Miller please settle the bill. No problem... Allow me! Good Sir... to go on with... This is all I have, but it might help. Thanks, that's nice of you. If you go broke... remind me. You're even more broke than I am. I'll talk to the old man in the morning. He does things like this. He's not happy about me keeping company with Eva. And he's probably damned-well right! All Eva's interested in is your money. Who's she dancing with. Adolf Fagerberg. He's Dad's biggest competitor... ...and a total idiot as well. You dance divinely! He looks like he sat too long under a hair drier! Bit of fun for Eva to play with. There is in fact a girl that I can give my all to, but... - But? - Can I pay now? We're paying! Fur 3,500 kronor, Stockings 90 kronor. I'm sick and tired of these accounts! How much do the bills come to, for this actress? Furs, stockings... and the devil knows what! Over 12,000. In 2 months? It's goddamned outrageous! It's disgusting! You're not to pay a penny to my son. Not a penny! I shall speak to my prodigal son today. What did we last talk about? Bah! What are you looking at? Is there something else? Sales for the month have declined. I suggest a small advertising campaign might do the trick. That again?! Advertising campaign?! Advertising campaign? Sheer lunacy! I don't want to hear about it! A newfangled swindle! Just a swindle! Fagerberg's my only real competitor. He doesn't do any advertising campaigning. He doesn't promote, any more than we do. People wash differently... that's all! But if we're going backwards, it means Fagerberg is getting ahead. Let him get ahead... He'll always be behind us. What were we talking about? Oh, that was it. How's the old man today? Relatively calm? And you? Usual sunny disposition? Is it going to be long before I can see him? You'll have to wait and see. I don't mind standing here in the sun. Besides, it gives me a chance to get to know you. You're not allowed to sit here! What if someone should come in? That's a shame, but how about I take you out somewhere? How about dinner this evening? Of course I'll have to see the old man first. Otherwise it'll be sandwiches. I don't have dinner with just anyone! But I'm not just anyone. Just leave me alone... ...or do I have to lose my cool. You're just a good-for-nothing! I'm not interested in your dinners. I'm a businesswoman. Alright! "Regarding my submission of today's date..." "...I would be grateful for a response at your earliest convenience." So what's the businesswoman-response to that, then? Do that again... but more of a caress this time. I hope your father won't give you a penny, so you'll have to start working! But... Has the heir apparent arrived? Yes, Sir. Sit down, lass. You do have business acumen, I think. No... I know you do. I have a bit of a proposition for you. There's nothing underhand about it. It's purely a business matter. I'm awfully sorry, Mr Miller, but now Karlsson's here again. Karlsson? Oh, yes, Karlsson! - Karlsson, with the interest. - Where is he then? Karlsson, how nice to see you! Now, about the quarterly interest on the last loan... How much is that? A piffling 1,500 kronor... No more than it should be. Sit down for a few minutes, while I see the old man. A few minutes? High finance, it's not! Damn it! Alright, Miss Lind... This is purely business, and no nonsense. We're clear about that? If you can make him want to work, I'll pay you 10,000 kronor! Yes, I'll do whatever I can. It upsets me to see a healthy young man not wanting to work. Yes, yes, yes! There's nothing wrong with the boy. His mother died young and I've had to see to the business. Now you can try to play Mummy. What? Yes, as I was saying... Good luck! Thank you, Sir. "I love..." Where the hell is "L"? There we are... Do you really not dare come out with me? - I really am a gentleman. - I didn't say you weren't. I don't usually scare easily. Well then...? So what shall we do? I think we should go to the theatre first. Maybe you're tired of that? But I'm not tired of YOU! What shall we see? Well, there's that "Madame Pompadour"... I'd really like to see Eva Zander. But we can go to the vaudeville theatre. OK, I'll get the tickets. What's the mood like in there? Same as usual. Keep your fingers crossed for me. Both hands. Can you pay me what's owed me, Miss? How much would that be? A piffling 1,500. I'm sorry... what...? You're such a funny man, Mr Karlsson! Do you really think you can...?! CAN? Karlssson can keep coming! "Can keep coming!"... Kope Company Killer... Soap Company Miller... I'm going silly! Damned Karlsson! Hullo! You can get 500 from the cashier. We'll discuss it tomorrow. Get your feet off the table! And smoke your own cigarettes! I won't put up with it! I'm as cool as a cucumber... But I'm telling you... it's finished! Finished! Oops! One has to live. Being your son, I have to represent you, and live in a respectably decent way. Right, Dad? You've represented me? You've lived respectably? Good heavens above...! No, I must stay calm! Leave those matches alone! Getting around with a lot of low-class people... Is that supposed be representing me? I can assure you that I'll be going out with a very nice girl this evening. Alright if I use my own matches? A lady that you already know and appreciate, Dad. You can consider the whole thing off. There was just one other thing, Dad... I'd forgotten about... a small expense... A mere trifle... just 1,500. I couldn't give a damn. I don't want to get angry, Dad.... Karlsson... I'm sorry, you'll have to come back tomorrow. Heavens above! Good day. Good morning. - Is young Mr Miller in? - No, he's not. But you can say what you said before. It was so funny.. Have you tried a cross, Mr Karlsson? You witch! Good morning, Sir. - Good morning. - Good morning, Sir. Well? Yep... What?! He declared his love for me yesterday. That's not damned work! No. But maybe just his old habit. Habit? Does it have to be his habit? Do you think it's serious? He's never serious about anything. Women always take it seriously. I've gone along, in the interests of our project. If it becomes a question of love, then I can't do it. Love? What's love? Love is an itch in your heart, that you're never able to scratch. What were we talking about? Yes... ...it was 'love' wasn't it? You have to be the impetus that makes a man out of that boy. You have to encourage him a little. No, I can't do that, Sir. I'd regret taking this on. Rubbish... Come on, we'll talk about it. Karlsson... It's been ages! Just wait a few minutes, OK? A few minutes he says! - So we're clear on that, Miss Lind? - Certainly, Sir. And don't forget the submission to Soap & Toothpaste Pty Ltd in Malmo. Excellent. Yes, that was right... Darling... What? - Thanks for last night. - Thanks?! I'm the one to say thanks. It was the most wonderful evening I've ever had! How many girls have you said that to? EVA! Eva... Yuk! This time I mean it. You're the first respectable woman I've been out with. Could we talk business now? - Business? You and I? - Yes. Have you never thought about working? Your father... The old man's starting to go a bit potty. You can't say that... He's a lovely guy. You're impossible... You have to start working! Why work, when the old man's got millions? Do I take work away from poor people...? Do you know what you are? You're an incompetent good-for-nothing! Do you have any right to live the way you do? Many poor families could live on what you splash around. You could at least show some respect for your father! It is outrageous... Goddammit! I love you. Is that all you have to say? Will you marry me? - What are you saying? - When shall we get married? I think you should go in and speak to your father. - About the wedding? - No. About working. Alright! I'll talk to him. I've got him wrapped around my little finger. He's probably taken a nap. How does this sound? "Hello, Dad... I thought..." Sounds silly, eh? "Dad... I require..." No, I'll wait until tomorrow for the requests. Pluck up courage, now. Alright. Hello Dad... How are you? Fine thanks... Your old man's doing well. What is it? I realise you're probably very busy. No, I've just had my regular nap. Don't touch the phone. Hello? Yes? - Dad, do you have... - Not a penny! I'm not talking about money now. Well, in fact I really am. My income is too small. You have an income?! My allowance is OK for 1, but much too small for 2. Have you 2? Two small? What are you talking about? Suppose I was to get married to your secretary... What was that? I'm suggesting I could get married. Should I say something? Aren't you surprised? Not at all. It's just you being stupid. Are people stupid to get married? You don't understand... It's something for later. What if I was to disinherit you? I can't imagine you would. Think about it... What do you think girls see in you? Sex appeal? No, not at all... You don't have any. Yes, you have one thing... and that's my wallet. My money is all the charm you have. Don't forget it. Realise that without it, she may not want you. I have to object to you insulting the woman I'm seriously in love with. What about "love"...? It's just humbug! Won't survive more than a month! No, I understand money... It's the marriage lifebuoy! What are you saying? It's just to annoy me! It's shameful how I'm kept waiting! No... So sad, so surly! He can't do this to me! I can find some more "S" words... wait... S-S-S-S ...See! No... you understand nothing about money! You wouldn't know how to earn 10 kronor a week. Me? I couldn't? You've never tried to get me to do anything worthwhile. But for HER sake... Don't think I can't earn money! How would you do that? Don't you try any funny-business! What do you mean? Don't cook up any schemes together! "Cook up..." Cook up! That's the answer... Cook up! Henry, don't do anything stupid now! What's going on? Has he gone crazy? What's got into the boy? Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid! - I need to put my coat on. - Where's your coat? You can try using... You can try humbug, or love, or whatever it takes... You've got time off to do whatever can be done... - No! - You'll get your money tomorrow. We're going to cook up! A queer customer! Will the boy boil butterscotch? Or braise beef brisket! My preserves! Careful with my preserves!? Calm down... I just need to find my cookbook. Goodness me! What would you want an old cookbook for? Can't I cook your meals any longer? I know very well that you can, Hilma. Hurrah! I've found it! So what do think you're going to cook? Cook? Let's see now... You'd best put on your winter woollies...! It's going to get cold! I'm cooking up some ice-cream! What is it, with some people?! Come right in... Look at this little cookbook... It's the basis for a happy marriage! Mum's old cookbook... Has it got an ice-cream recipe? No, it's the soap recipe I'm interested in. "Recipes for cheap household and toilet soap." I'm going to get into the soap business. How will you do it? Dad got rich from soap... and he got the idea from Mum. She knew how to make soap. I know I can do it... Fagerberg is Dad's only competition. I know that I'm going to get people?s support. "Soap king challenged by his son!" "Forget the rest..." "Get the people's soap!" How about that...? "The People's Soap" Fantastic... but... "There is nothing other than The People's Soap.". But one thing has to be found... Money! Money? I'll borrow that from Dad, of course. You can't borrow from your dad, to set up a competitor. Oh, to have your good sense! And your ideas! There's a Mr Bergman to see you. Show him in. He's a good friend of mine. Nice guy. Come in. - Thanks for last night. - Thanks to you. - It was very pleasant. - Stimulating. Sorry... this is Mr Bergman... Miss Lind, Dad's private secretary. Thanks for the loan. Peanuts. Sit down... Would you like a drink? Why not? He's full of good ideas.! Yes, but his last suggestion was a bit weak. Suggestion? Is it anything to get excited about? You bet it is ! Get these out of the way. Here is where we get down to business! Big business... Involving soap. Soap? Good product... delightful. Do you mean that your old man is pulling out? It'll go like... "Miller Jr takes over company." Fresh new ideas... Advertising head, Ambrose Bergman." Actually, we'll be competing with Miller's Soap. Splendid! He and his dad have quarreled. Now it's a knife-fight with my old man. - How long before you start? - Within the hour. The results will be great, if advertising has the terrific power you claim it has. IF ?! You can't tell ME about advertising! Perhaps Miss Lind believes love is all to life? Absolutely wrong, but... The psychology of printing ink... that's what guides the spirit of life. For example... A professor showed two pieces of silk to 40 female students. One pink. One blue. Same price. Same quality. One was described as "warm antique rose". The other as "faded blue". Which did the ladies prefer? Yes, 39 out of 40 students said "warm antique rose, of course." Why? He highlighted the excellence of the product. It's the psychology of it. The power of suggestion... advertising! You can't tell ME about advertising! I'm not only young... I'm smart. I never read advertisements. Really? Haven't you read this...? "Jung & Orka, still going strong." "Get it right, take Cloetta!" "Handsome anglers have Stomatol teeth, brush one at a time!" "Murine's so fine..." "Skanska's coffee blend... good to the last drop." "You can't trust the others." Do you think 'His Master's Voice' is a brandy... ....and 'Martel' is a gramophone? What products do you associate with Enkoping and Vasteras? Not advertising, is like a man winking at a woman in the dark. The man knows what he's doing. But how is the woman to know, without some publicity? No, it doesn't work. Give me time, money and a full page... ...and I'll sell housing plots in the Atlantic Ocean. Are you quite sure about this? Am I ?! What lipstick do you wear? French. French? Why? because in the ads it says it's kiss-proof. There are factories in Sundbtberg, that make eau de cologne. And so people know what it is, it's called Kolnisch Wasser The Devil himself wouldn't buy 'Sundbyberg's Water'! - What eggs do you eat? - Hens' eggs of course. Of course! - Have you tried duck eggs? - No. Do you have anything against duck eggs, personally? No. No... that's just what I'm saying. The duck doesn't make a sound when she lays an egg... But the hen yells it out to the whole yard! Enough! Got the message! We'll have heaps of advertising. What's the product called? How do you like "The People's Soap"? The People's Soap? No... Not at all exciting. How about "World's Cheapest Soap."? - Yes? - No. There's not a person anywhere, who'd buy the world's cheapest soap.. Would it be possible for... Yes... Even like... No. Perhaps you could call it Aphrodite or... ...Cleopatra. So people think it's a new dance or a racehorse! No way! I've got it! It has to be something about superstition! Everybody's superstitious. No... I'm not. Really... get over here, quick! Your car... What's that on the radiator? - A horseshoe? - What's it for? It brings you luck. See! Everyone's superstitious! What about number 13? I've got it! I've got it! 13-soap! 13-soap... Great... brilliant! "13-soap - a disaster for dirt." Oh boy! Within a month, 13-soap will be the most asked-for in the country. Just leave it to me! Ambrose will fix everything! Imagine my old man's reaction! This is the moment I've been waiting for! Just give me 25,000... ...and I'll be able to organise an advertising campaign... ...with results your father would never have imagined in his wildest dreams. Let's say we have 25,000 in hand... ...I suggest that 10,000 goes to... Have I said something stupid? Yes, you're talking about money. Oh... Well, then... It was a nice job while it lasted. - Maybe I can raise... - Money? Yes, 10,000. 10,000, my boy...! How about that?! There's no way I can borrow money from you. I's not a question of borrowing. I'd be helping someone... ...someone I know... ...by earning interest from this, instead of the bank. Do you know this person well? Yes... nearly as well as I know myself. Now we start advertising... It'll be great to get into it again! "13-Soap"... What a product! I'll call you in an hour. Goodbye Mr Bergman. Listen... Are you doing this just because... Because you're starting to work. - Only that? - Yes, only that. You... Henry! Come here! Such style! Sorry, we've got business to attend to. We open our office in the morning. It must be classy. It mustn't cost anything. You're getting 10,000 from me. That goes on advertising. Got an idea... We'll fix up my place as an office. Middle of town... it'll do for now. Sounds good! Don't you have something else you have to do? - Do I? - The soap recipe. Of course... my mum's...! Here we are... My dear old mother! What are you telling me? That I've fulfilled my part of the deal. Your son shows an irrepressible willingness to work.. It seemed that's the case... He was acting a bit weird when he went out. What sort of work is it, may I ask? I'm not in a position to elaborate... But that wasn't included in the agreement, Sir. No, it was just a matter of motivation. Will he or won't he? But what are we talking about? Yes... work! Of course, I don't doubt your word, but...... - But you'd like some evidence, Sir? - Yes. Read the newspapers, day after tomorrow. He's already started work today. What was it you were bothering me about? - Yes, the 10,000. - Yes, thanks. And there was something else. Would I be able to take 2 weeks leave? Sure, that's quite alright. There's your money. That's an idea! I should also take some leave... ...now that I have a son who's going to work! Is it really true that you have sulphuric acid in soap? Yes, it makes it a beauty preparation. Removes both the freckles and the face! Will Mary be here soon? Yes, she's paying the advertising agency. Because tomorrow it takes off! - Look at that! - Lovely! Listen... a serious question... How's your father's health, in general? I'm worried he may have a heart attack tomorrow. - What are you talking about? - The advertisements! The advertisements! I can see his face now, when he reads them! Come in! Hello. How many stilt-walkers have you arranged? There are 12 of us. - What time does your dad get up? - 8 o'clock, so long as he's roused. At 9 o'clock you should walk back and forth in front of Miller's window Hello again. Mary! Welcome, light of my life, my apple blossom. How does work feel? Wonderful! The first batch of 13-Soap is nearly ready. It just needs the right aroma. It must smell like a dewy dawn! Just look at you! I never realised how wonderful it is to work! Excuse me, I need the boss's attention for a moment. Time is money! You have to think about our next ads... I can't get an answer out of him. - What shall I do about this/ - Use this... I was thinking of a full page... What sort of humbug is this? "13-Soap... disaster for dirt" "Only available from... Henry Miller" Is it him who's crazy, or is it me? No. I really have gone crazy! Berta! Berta! What do you want? Get out, woman! Come and blow... now! - Get me Henry! - He's gone to his office. His office? HIS?! Out with it, woman! That's only what he told me to say. I have to talk to him. Get out, I said! God, my heart's pounding! What does that boy think he's up to... It?s all just humbug! I need air! 13 Soap What's the number? 13... 13... 13! help me to stay calm! That's good eh? - It's great. - And I'm the one who did it. Hello, Bergman. Is that my old man? Mr Miller the manager, is very busy. I'll see if he's in the warehouse. Hello, warehouse! No, the manager isn't here. You might find him in the cashier's office. Alright, transfer me. Cashier's office! No, the manager isn't here. I'll transfer you to the private office. Put on the American accent! Just a moment! Come on... Hurry up... Get on with it! 5,000! 50,000! Hello, what's this about? Oh, so it's YOU, Dad! Henry... what sort of madness are you getting up to now? You think you'll compete with me?! I'll keep cool. Yes, I'm cool... Cool as a cucumber. What are those damned advertisements I saw?! And what about those 3 overgrown idiots parading outside my window? Just curious! Only 3? We've got 30 guys on stilts around town. More! 300! That'll become 300. Do you want to see me? It's a bit difficult... No, it'd be alright if you could come right away. 13 Apelberg St, 3rd floor. Look forward to seeing you! Thanks awfully! If anyone asks, I'll be at the office in an hour. How's your morning mood? Brighten up with 13-Soap 13 Apelberg St. Can I see my son? Don't you know who I am? Henry Miller! Oh... Mr Miller! My name's Bergman, head of advertising. Nice of you to drop in and see us. I want to see my son! One moment, I'll check if he's free. Henry, your father's here. Can I speak with the managing director... If he's not too busy with the Morgans or the Rockefellers! Make yourself comfortable. Here is a proof of the posters! Thanks. Tell the printers I'll get right back to them! Anyway, I don't take your competition attempt seriously! It won't be long before 13-Soap is the most sought-after in Sweden. In the whole world! Why not the universe? You have men on stilts and neon lights all round town? Well, it's just humbug! This is certainly not humbug.... Look at this, Boss! Sure... Hold it up for a moment. Now you'll get to see some real advertising! "Make black white" Wonderful! Order 40,000. 40,000?! Henry, my boy! We've always known each other... You're my son, aren't you? What on earth are you up to? I'm making decisions. All those posters... And thousands of men on stilts! My dear boy, may I ask... Who's going to pay for it all? I don't pay a penny! It's very simple, of course... Advertising pays for itself. From Kiruna to the USA, people will be thanking us for 13-Soap. Advertising! Advertising?! Advertising is an underhand way of getting people to buy rubbish!. I'll show you the importance of advertising. Do you think love means everything in life? Wrong! It doesn't mean a thing! The psychology of printing ink is what means everything! You can't tell ME about advertising!! A lady professor showed two pieces of silk to her housekeeper. They were both just the same... ...but one was called faded pink and a beautiful salmon pink. I might be young, but I wasn't born yesterday! "Get it right, take Cloetta!" "You'll feel better, take Mazetta! "The good old cure for coughs." "White, beautiful Stomatol teeth... Just brush one at a time." You think cognac's an American foxtrot they dance at Solvalla? For a man to wink at a woman in the dark, is bad advertising! What sort of lipstick do you wear? French, because you think that they're kiss-proof! And you don't eat duck-eggs... Why? Because hens are the only ones who advertise! Stop it! Stop it! I've heard quite enough of your waffling. My intention was to see you working. Seriously... not playing games! What were we talking about? Oh yes... It's unforgivable that my name, so respected in the soap world... ..is advertised in connection with your damned humbug "13-Soap". You stay out of it! It's not only disloyal competition... it's ridiculous into the bargain! Show me one bar of soap you've made so I can believe in your work! You call this stuff soap? No... you don't have any soap! The first soap bars are ready! And my old man said we didn't have any soap! Just look at it! Well... what? Maybe I should try washing my hands with it! It actually lathers! If only my old mum could see us now, Darling! Now I can truly say, let's get to work on 13-Soap! Now we can go to war with my old man! There are just 3 things we'll need... Money... money... and money. I'll sell my car and my boats... I can sell my jewellery! Mary! Ambrose... phone for you... Outside! Yes, I heard it ringing. Would you really sell your jewellery for my sake? Yes... Why shouldn't I? But it mean... Say what you didn't want to say before... So, you don't love me? I didn't used to like you... You were so careless... But... Say it then! Maybe I can give you something in advance... - Has it heated up? - Sure has. Charlie, add that in. Good morning! How's it going? We're cooking up more than they've time to package. Is the soap looking good? I'll run up to the warehouse for a bit. That's fine, Olsson. How are you going with the packaging? How's it going? We've no time for trial orders. Big orders are flooding in! Really?! Am I still a good-for-nothing wastrel? No, you're terrific. You look as though you could work if you wanted to! Do you regret saying yes? Have I said yes? Henry. Try and be serious. We can't carry on like this. - You have to get yourself a factory. - Yes, that's obvious. That costs money. Where will you get it? The advertising is working... ...but you have to take advantage of it, now! That costs money! Stop worrying about trifles... It'll work out! And as soon as everything's running smoothly, we get engaged, right?. Sell the brand to your dad, before it turns into a disaster. Then we'll talk about getting hitched. We talk business here. If I don't get a kiss out of you right now, it WILL be a disaster! We can't allow that! I don't think I'll sell the brand to either Dad or Fagerberg I'll show those two old fogeys how modern business methods work. But you're so inexperienced, Henry! You're the first woman who's ever said THAT to me! How shall I respond, Sir? What are you talking about? Show me. "We apologise for thinking you manufactured 13-Soap." "Of course we shall direct our orders to them direct." "Yours faithfully H. Blomkvist." "Mr. P. Fagerberg, Manager. The Soap Company." "We've nothing against your 'Lily' brand soap..." ..."but the only soap in demand, despite being dearer, is 13-Soap." Yours faithfully, P.A. Holm and Co. Bloody hell! Come in! Hello, Dad. So, what is it? I'll call you if I need you. So, what are you doing? Stupid question. Nothing, of course. Look at Henry Miller... He's doing something useful! Is there nothing of me to be found in you? I've always enjoyed work. One can't have fun all the time, Dad! I wouldn't want any subordinate post. Find something for yourself, then! Look at Henry Miller. I'll make you an offer... I'll give you a cheque for 10,000 and 5,000 cash... and that's it! Then you can look after yourself. A well-dressed type like you shouldn't have trouble. What would I be able to do, Dad? To do? Sell soap! Soap?! Don't the people in your circles wash themselves? - What is it? - Disaster. The advertising agency stopped credit yesterday! Our whole rural campaign will be down the drain, without 10,000 cash today! - You can't mean it! - I sure do! It's the advertisement that'll put the icing on the cake! Yes? A man wants to talk to you, Sir. Does he look like a bear? I think he looks more like a plate... A fashion plate! Send him in. Hi there, Henry! I'd like to talk to you in private... about business. Mary, would you mind leaving us alone for a little while. Is Mr Miller available? He's busy... Take a seat. So if I can invest 10,000 in your company... There's the cheque... If you could write something to show I'm with the company. Our oldies are going to be gobsmacked! Cigar? No thanks, a bit big for me. We actually don't need any cash, but for old friendship's sake, we'll take it. - Cigarette? - More my style. You did me a favour, you know. You took Eva off my hands, remember? Yes, she got a bit expensive and she got tired of me. But I got tired of her. You get tired of women easily, when you've had as many as you and I've had. But it's essential we put something in writing. Some sort of agreement. Just to show that I'll be starting work! - The cheque is good, is it? - Dad has so much money, it must be. - Just a moment...! - No hurry... I'm happy to wait. We're getting orders. But if the ad agency doesn't get its money, they'll shut the door on us. People will think we're broke... and then we will be. We have to find it. We're in luck! Was it 10,000 we needed? I have them here, under certain conditions. I'll tell you. Forgive my question, Miss... Poor parents! 13-Soap company? This is for you. Have you seen Mr Miller? Yes, he's in there. What is it? - Reply-paid telegram. - You read it! That 10,000 was a nice break, eh? Order for 10,000 bars of soap. Immediate delivery. C.O.D.! Where on earth are we going to get them from?! Henry. What are we going to do...? Idea! - What's Miller's wholesale price? - 40 cents each. And we get 75. We make a clear profit of 3,500! Get the cash so we can buy off the old man. Adolf, I've got a nice deal for you. Put up 4,000, and I guarantee a 50 percent profit. I did get 5,000 from Dad. That's splendid...! I didn't get more because he thinks I'm a spendthrift. You don't need your dad's money when you're your own boss! Well Dad says I'm my own worst enemy. Come and we'll change the agreement. No, I can't wait any longer! Now it's all fixed...! Good morning, Mr Miller. Hello there, Mr Karlsson! Might I have that 1,500 today? Impossible today. Come again tomorrow. "Tomorrow" is all I ever hear! I obviously need to take you to court to get anywhere. So be it. - Goodbye. - Goodbye Mr Karlsson. Now we've got the cash to buy Dad's soap. You'll change the packaging won't you? The Boss What's this?! It's not possible! Have we sold 4,000 kronor worth of soap to the 13-Soap company? Looks like it. So they sell our soap as theirs! It's unheard of! They paid cash. We can't stop them. No? We certainly can! Not another bar of soap to that fraudulent outfit! It's false representation to sell someone else's product as your own. We'll put a stop to this travesty! Are you still here? It's not for me! Don't pester me! I'm making sure that you're son is working. I'm out of work at the moment. Where is the boy? In conference with the advertising manager. He'll be free soon. Was it your idea to buy soap from me? No, it wasn't. Naturally Henry wanted to support his father with the purchase! Dad! Welcome! How are you? Fine. But you seem to be out of your mind. Why? How can you buy my soap and repackage it as your own? What else can we do? Until our factory's ready, we have to buy soap. If you don't want to sell to us, we'll get it from Fagerberg. You can be sure of that. We have the money . Fagerbergs don't have a quality product! And I'm not going to be a middleman. Orders are pouring in from all over the country. But it's a swindle to sell goods you don't have! Did you have a million bars of soap in store, when you started out? No, I started from scratch. You think you can start a major concern, without any experience or money. Modern business thinking can be worth a lot! Exactly! Miller. No, I know you! No, Sir, you have to learn how to create demand. Teach people to wash themselves 3 times a day... That's business! I wanted you to work, so I gave you an incentive. She got 10,000 from me, to persuade you to work. But meant honest, regular work! I can put that 10,000 on my advertising account! Miss Lind, who is used to proper work, may now leave this playground! Well... now I get it... Dad was the one you knew, nearly as well as yourself! But hell get the money back today! I'll be done with both of you! - Let me explain... - There's nothing to explain! You can go back to him! We'll manage without any women! Wait a minute... Could I have a word with Mary... Go easy on that American-style. Don't fret, go back to old Miller and I'll call you in the morning. Calm down... Ambrose fixes everything. Maybe she didn't love you at first... But let me assure you... she does now. I know women. There was this girl in Boston... What a girl! No... We have to talk business. We've got 10,000 cash to buy soap. The money I've got goes to Dad. Your dad? Otherwise he'll brag to me that I only got started with his money. - But listen... - Never, old chap! 7, 8, 9, 10... Exactly right. Hang on... I need a signed receipt. Of course you'll have a signed receipt. There you are... all signed for. 10,000 kronor... Where on earth did that boy get so much money from? He hasn't started stealing, has he? There's no one more honest than Henry! Honest? When he buys my soap and sells it as his own?! It's business... and you were properly paid. I can't go on for long. And that advertising idiot Bergman is an absolute humbug! His advertising worked. It got extra inquiries. But they can't go into production without Mon... So, they don't have any money... So it is all humbug! You mustn't say anything to Henry, Sir. You wouldn't want to ruin his chances. No, I won't say anything. But I could by the brand-name so he can repay what he borrowed. It's very rude to keep someone who's interested, waiting. Mr Miller really is busy. 13-Soap Co... No... The manager is in conference at the moment. As I said... your ad campaign did the trick... ...so we quickly sold out our sample stock. Now we require immediate delivery of 50,000 to our head office in Malmo. That's a lot on account. Don't worry, we pay cash on delivery. We'll return to my proposal for exclusive rights for the South, for your company's products. Needless to say, we're willing to pay well if we're sure of your capacity to deliver. You can be sure of that. Tell me, whereabouts is your factory? Our new factory is under construction. Until it's ready, what we can't make ourselves is being made at my father's. It's our patented recipe, of course, and under the control of our chemists. That's fine. But to get back to the critical point, that delivery must be immediate We have to strike while the ads are hot, or the campaign may falter. See, I have to sneak up on you. I just needed to be convinced that 13-Soap Co. can deliver the goods. Yes, of course. But I do have to stress that... ...that our agreement with 13-Soap Co. is confidential. I'll have to discuss it with my son first. Well I'll call back in half an hour then. That'll be fine. Your son's really pulled it off. But my board wants consignment details for the 50,000 bars of soap... ...before I'm allowed to sign. Yes... well... Just a note from you would be satisfactory. There's no humbug in good business... That's my principle. You have to call your dad right away! But that's being too weak. We'll manage the delivery first, then WE dictate terms to Dad. Got it? WE dictate terms. But for heaven's sake... we don't have a penny to do it with! In the hall there are people who've worked for us... ...who are waiting to be paid. How are we going to deliver 50,000 bars, when we don't have any people?! You're not serious! Yes... come and see! The manager isn't here! When he comes, he'll see you one at a time. You're lying, you little runt! We'll have no disturbing the peace, if you please. I've said you're out. Sneak out the back door, straight to your old man. Henry Miller! Uncle Oskar here. Hi there, Uncle! I thought you and I should talk a little business. I've been speaking to Adolf. If you have written orders in hand, then we'd be able to do business. But how's the agreement with Adolf? Mr Miller isn't here! He's at his aunt's in Falsterbo! He'll be back in half an hour. Come on, calm down... Come back in half an hour and I promise you'll get your money! We know all about that! You're not fooling me... I'm not leaving! No, Mr, Karlsson, please take a seat. I'll be there as soon as I can. I'll just check with the warehouse that the soap is there. I'll bring the contract. Make sure Adolf stays. Yes, I'll hang onto him. Well, goodbye. Warehouse! That was some deal I made with you! Isn't Henry working? Now he's working far too much! I've enjoyed having a nice quiet business. Now I don't know whether I'm coming or going. Youth also wants to participate. But anyone would think there's something wrong with my company. It's old-fashioned. If I was you, I'd deliver that soap to Henry on credit. Never! The boy has to learn to crawl before he can walk. But I must make sure he doesn't buy anything from Fagerberg. You've got to hold on to Henry any way possible. So long as he doesn't do anything stupid. I'm the one who'll dictate terms! Quick!... Show me that you're the epitome of a woman who knows what she wants! There was no need for you to come. I love Henry. Warehouse? The boss says the trucks are to go to 13-Soap Co. Immediately! I'll come with you to supervise the delivery. Clever girl! Damnation! Adolf Fagerberg is a partner in the company. He has to be stopped. Come on! Fagerberg's factory. Warehouse connected. Can I see Mr Fagerberg? He's in the warehouse. He'll be right back. But if you'd like to wait, Mr Miller... take a seat. Henry... An ad using the epitome of a real woman! A full page! We've no time for that now... Come along.... How silly! Would you believe that I feel I'm becoming quite vexed all of a sudden! I can't understand why Henry doesn't come. It's disgraceful. But I guess I can wait a little bit longer. I'll take the responsibility. I can say that I mimicked Mary's voice on the phone. One of my areas of expertise. What I did will pay off. Have you done this for my sake? No, for my own... You dope! Mr Bergman... We won't get them packaged in time, if we don't get some help! Just keep on working... I'll find a couple more. We need them right away! - Mr Bergman! - Oh, hello Mr Fagerberg! Great to see you! Now I realise I have to get angry again. Where's Henry? Isn't he coming? Henry? Yeah.... Come this way! Your father wants you to work, doesn't he?. So come into the works and give us a hand. I get so worried when I think about all the firm's creditors. Would it be possible, Mr Bergman, for you to help me with Dad... He'll be so terribly unhappy, if I don't get my money back. You help me and I'll help you! No, I told you, it's all got to go to Malmo! We'll do the rest later. Olsson, here's one more who wants to work! Show him how to do the packaging. It's quite easy...! Girls... you come and help here! No... aren't you going to take your coat off? Can you forgive me? I had to believe Dad was right when he said you loaned me the money on his account. Can you forgive me... ...for pretending to be in love with you, before I really was?.. Adolf's got a job... packaging soap! You really do have a cheek! If I could afford it, I'd rather have got some messenger boys. I know some reliable ones. But it was important to get him to do packaging. Why? Because he can't be allowed to see his dad. Thanks to your stupid boys, the old man could be here at any time. Find 15,000 to buy Adolf out. You know where he is. 15,000? Where am I going to find 15,000? I'm not going to stand here doing nothing, any longer! Wow!... I'm really getting clever at doing this! I haven't had so much fun since I was a kid. It's easy to go wrong though. Is that right now? Olsson! We've got one more! Great! We need all the help we can get. Come on... think of it as going to a dance. Connected. Isn't Mr Fagerberg coming? I'll find out. Is he still in the warehouse? I see. Thank you. He's gone straight to 13-Soap Co. with the delivery trucks. What?! Is there really no one you can borrow it from? I've found one more! Karlsson's on the packaging line. Hey... I've got it! Straw! Crazy! Beyond me. Hi Henry! I'm having great fun! Hi there... Can I have a word with you, Karlsson? You turn over a lot of money every day, don't you? Yes, some people pay their bills. Lend me 17,000 for 10 minutes! Impossible! It mustn't go wrong! If you can hold out, can you dictate the terms? If we get the soap away. Come out to the packing room... And hang on to Adolf. ...16...17. For 10 minutes, Karlsson... with interest! What about my measly 1,500 then? Tomorrow, Karlsson. Dead certain! Dead certain! Fixed, would you believe?! Fixed! Mr Miller has gone out, but... My name's Bergman. Please come this way, Sir... I need more wrappers! Adolf, can I have a word with you? Yes, but I don't know if I have time. You?ll get your money! Now you've earned 2,000 in a flash. Just sign the receipt. That cancels our agreement. But I can keep going with my work, can't I? I've had such an awfully lot of fun! Such pretty girls! I've no more time for you now! I want to talk to my son son! Mr Miller Sr wishes to see his son. He's presently with young Mr Fagerberg. Fagerberg?! Goddamned nonsense! I know my son's interested in the company. So I'll take over the whole shebang, before old Miller does. Miller, who doesn't believe in advertising! The name alone is worth 100,000! I can assure you Sir, that the company is bankrupt! Bankrupt? Hello, how are you? Don't ask... I'm here to talk business. Is there anything to talk about, since you're not interested in 13-Soap? Actually, it's quite a good brand name. Pretty good. It's downright damned great. You're flattering me, Dad! Don't you think I understand such things? Now listen... I'd like you to join forces with me! You mean YOU will join forces with ME? No, I didn't mean that. There are many who'd like to join up with me. Come and I'll show you. What do you mean? Where are we going? That's not possible... How much did you say, Mr Fagerberg? 100,000. 110,000, I'm saying. You heard it for yourself. I'll offer 125,000. No... when I think about it... You can't deliver those 50,000... can you?! You don't think I can? Let me tell you, they'll be out of here in no time. Come and see. There you could see the power of advertising. But nothing's settled yet. Alright, you can have 200,000. It'd be worth it, to see you working. Can I have 17,000 cash, now? - And you owe Mary 10,000. - Steady on, now! That can be a little wedding present. I'd prefer give that money to her myself. There's your cheque for 17,000. For 13-Soap...! I'm working... And it's so much fun! That sounds like him! Don't sell, Adolf! I've done it, Dad, and I made 2,000 all by myself. I've had so much fun, I'll start out on my own. You stupid fool! Same to you, with knobs on! A humbug product like 13-Soap, can never survive. Bullshit! Miller & Son will always be a success. Take a seat! Boys! Through advertising we've created a need to wash over and over again. From China to the USA! I have the brand name of 13-Soap, and it's worth 300,000! I got 200,000! Thanks to advertising. But you don't understand, because you're old-fashioned.. You think there's nothing more important than love! Rubbish! It's something else. Lend me your hat! The business of advertising... psychology of printing ink... publicity... You can't talk to me about it! I'm not only old, I'm dumb, too... I mean young! Of course you never read ads. Did you have any idea that French bread is baked in Sweden? The lady professor drinks Sundbyberg water, and not Eau de Cologne... ...because it reminds her of Long John Extra Strong. That's from suggestion! "Get the right one, take a Stomatol tooth." You think a piece of silk is like a salmon... ...and His Masters Voice is a gramophone... Stupid. His Master's Voice is an American horse... ...that races at Sundsval and winks at women. Why do you drink French cognac? Yes, because you think it's kiss-proof. Why do you only eat duck eggs? Because you don't understand advertising. Have you ever heard a hen advertising for her eggs? Thank you, just what I deserve! How nice of you! The whole company together! So we'll sign a contract on the spot. The company of Miller & Son will soon be happy... to negotiate with your firm in Malmo. It's all fixed! Now the southern Swedes can get clean. Out of the way! Old fogey! So we know the order's gone through. Welcome to the southern kingdom of Skane! On their honeymoon... the newlyweds should visit Malmo. Goodbye, Mr Miller. Oh, yes... what were we talking about? You're always welcome in Skane! Goodbye, give everyone my regards. Karlsson... Here's your 17,000. Thanks for your help. And my interest? My measly... Do you have change for 200,000? I don't charge interest that high. Come back another day! Here's 2 kronor for packaging work, instead. Tomorrow is another day. "Tomorrow"... I know all about "tomorrow". Listen... now that all the business problems have been dealt with... ...there's something I have a right to know... We can drop titles, can't we? I'll also leave a little start-up capital here... For you. You've earned that for getting him to work. What were we talking about? Yes, did you buy the soap from Fagerberg? No... from you... We pay cash. The money stays in the family. Isn't she the epitome of a woman who knows what she wants! A Column 7... a Sunday Supplement... You can call me Uncle. You're a short story... A damned serial! No pushing, Uncle! So what will you be when you grow up? Oh boy! You'll be our head of advertising. And first you'll do an ad for Miller & Sons marriage... ...with the world's most effective motivator... The woman who knows what I want The whole production must be changed. We have to aim for a new attractive and modern format! - The ingredients are wrong. - The packaging is wrong. What a wrapper! Are you going to promote some sort of ironing device? Don't talk nonsense! YOU can't teach ME anything about advertising. Ironing device? What are you talking about? This is my latest promotional idea... A bath soap that doesn't slip out of your hands. A bath soap with a grip... ...if you can get a grip on what that means. This isn't a bit of humbug! Have you seen someone trying to hang on to wet soap? You can't include it... You don't understand suggestion and the printed word. You don't understand the power of advertising! Sorry to interrupt, but I thought we were getting married in an hour. I'm sorry, sweetheart, but we've had so much to do. - Do you have any witnesses? - You can be one of them. Sorry, I couldn't stop Mr. Karlsson! My fiftieth attempt! Great! Wedding witness number 2! Welcome, Karlsson! I haven't forgotten the measly 1,500... But I haven't had time. I'm getting married today. Come again tomorrow, Karlsson! But not too early! T H E E N D Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
