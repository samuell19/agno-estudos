[Irish music] - You want them that small? - I'm not sure. How much, your porgies? - Them's $1.72 a pound. - They were $1.67 Saturday. - Uh, yeah. That was Saturday. Today being Tuesday. - Well, my father'd roll over in his grave if he knew dead fish went up five cents in three days. - Basic supply and demand, Cody. The commercial lobstermen determine the price. What's left to you independents,you just got to deal with it. - Well, someday someone's gonna have to deal with me. Alright, give me... give me $10 of mackerel. - Comin' right up. - You ain't gonna charge me for that one, are you? - No. - Just wanna make sure you didn't think I was shopliftin'. - Uh, yeah. - I'll see you, Rusty. [Irish music] [seagulls cawing] Good mornin', Frank. [motor sputtering] [motor starting] [motor stopping] [starting] [Irish music] [music fading] - Jakey, come on! - What's that smell? - It's bacon. - No, not that smell, the other smell. - Oh, that's some perfume Ann gave me. You like it? - At least it smells better than Dad's lobster boots. - Your armpit smells better than Cody's boots. But thanks for the compliment. [barking] [whimpering] - Stump, why you gotta bother mewhen I'm eatin'? - You hurry up, I'll give you a ride. Otherwise, you have to walk to school. - Can you drop me at Mike's?I can walk to school from there. - How are Mike and his mom doing? - Fine, I guess. - Oh, look at the time, Jake. You've gotta go. - Alright. [birdsong] Hey, Ma? Can you take me by Brock's later? I need some new pants. - Maybe at the end of the month. Have to see how we're doin'. - You always gotta see how we're doin', Ma. It's never as good as everybody else. - Jake, that's not true. Hmm? - It is true, Ma. You just won't admit it. [soft guitar music] [cawing] [Irish music] - Shite. Nothin' but shite these days. [cawing] I see you're havin' as tough a time catchin' dinner today as I am. If I give this to ya, ya promise not to crap on my boat? Sorry, I don't trust ya. I'm gonna throw it over there. You can go get it. [cawing] Damn seagull. [sighing] Tch. Argh. - That's Mike. - Shhh. [both giggling] - Hey, if you were stuck on a deserted island, who's the one person you'd wanna have with ya? - Which island? - What do you mean, which island? No one asks which island. [scoffing] - Well, I mean, if you're somewhere like the cove, which has a lot of crabs, I'd bring a little crabber. But if it was, let's say, Monhegan, with all them birds-- - Okay, okay, okay. A tropical islandwith one palm tree and no crabs. - I dunno. You're my best friend. Guess I'd wanna bring... you. - Man, I like you, Jake, but if it were me, I'd wanna be stranded with Shelly O'Connor. [Jake chuckling] We'd build fires together, fish together, harvest our coconut tree. 'Course, most of the time, we'd just spend makin' out, tryin' not to get rescued. - Yeah... [bell ringing] - Hey, Brewer. What are you doing looking at my dad's store for? You know you can't afford anything in there anyway. - Not everyone wants to dress like a mannequin, Timmy. - Yeah, well, you know what? I'd rather dress like a mannequin than an ad for Salvation Army. [soft Irish music] - Don't worry about it. [soft Irish music] - Well, if it isn't the fearless Cody Brewer. - Hey, Walter. - Looks like you took a direct hit on your bow there. - Ah, see that, do ya? - Uh, yeah. If one of them flyin' rats crapped on my boat, I'd shoot it outta the sky with a .22. - Probably figured my boat needs a paint job. Not half wrong, either. - Where you workin' next? - Headed out Cuckolds Rocks. - Dammit, Cody, you gotta stop fishin' fools' rocks. One storm comes outta the south, I'm gonna end up bein' a pallbearer at your funeral. You know how much I hate wearin' a suit. - Serves you right to be uncomfortable after what you done to porgy prices. [chuckling] - Just be careful, Cody, 'cause friends are a lot harder to come by than lobsters. - Yeah. They sure don't pay as well, though, do they? [soft music] [birdsong] - Eddie, need it boiled for table six. - What's the matter with the bluefish I made? - Too fishy. - Well, I hope the lobster isn't too lobstery. Joe, pass me a boiled one? Alright, I figure I got 15 seconds before Joe gets me that lobster to tell you how lovely you look today. Never did get used to handlin' a compliment, did ya, Martha? - I suppose not. - Well, that ain't gonna stop mefrom givin' 'em to ya. - Thanks. Eddie. You're a lifesaver. - Tsk. [soft music] [grunting] [soft music] - Never seen seaweed like that before. [soft music] [ship's horn blowing] - A tourist, a charter-boat captain and a lobsterman walk into a bar. To their surprise, when they get their drinks, each of them finds a fly floatin' in their beer. So the tourist, he just quickly sets his beer aside in disgust. The fisherman, of course, he just fishes his fly out of his beer and drinks it. - Uh-huh. Uh, yeah. What about the lobsterman? - The lobsterman. Well, he holds the fly by its wings over his beer mug, and he yells: "Spit it out, spit it out!" [laughter] - Spit it out... Spit it out. That's funny! [laughing] - Spit it out. That's funny. [laughing] - Hey there, Cody. - Hey, guys. - You workin' that late shift again, I see. Let me buy ya a beer. - No, thanks, Walt. I gotta get home. Bubba, just wanted to let you know one of your pots got tangled in a channel marker back at Squirrels' Island. - Gee, thanks, Cody. - No problem. Well, I'll see you guys tomorrow. - We'll see ya. - Take her easy, Cody. - That's a tough life he's got. - Oh, yeah. Sometimes I think he makes it tougher than it oughta be. - Bubba's right. Last year, I asked Cody if he wanted to join the co-op with me. You know what he says? He says, he says, he says, "I'll have to think about it." [scoffing] To think about it! Can you believe that? A guy with a boat I wouldn't letmy kids flounder fish in says he'll have to think about it. Tsk-tsk-tsk. - Well, you know what they say. To understand a man, you gotta walk a mile in his boots. - Uh, yeah. It's a good thing his boots don't fit me. [barking] - Hey... Hey, fella. Hey. How ya doin'? Hey, Stump, hey. Come on. Come on. - So, Cody, how was your day? - Oh, the usual. You know, pulled a few pots, threw back some crabs, dodged some seagull sh-- - Cody. - Sorry. Droppings. - Hey, Dad? Can I get them new pants tomorrow? - Jakey, I said we'd see at the end of the month. - But, Ma, if I wear these pants again, Timmy Brock'll make fun of me. - What's Timmy Brock have against brown pants? - Forget it. - When I was your age, I was pullin' pots to pay for my own pants. - We got any relish? - We got ketchup and we got mustard. - Can't you just be happy with mustard and ketchup? Why do you always want what we don't have? [sighing] [soft Irish music] [sighing] Oh, damn engine. Better off with a rubber band. [seagulls cawing] [sighing] Yah!! Ah!! Ah! [exclamations] Ah... [groaning] Ah... Ah... [exclamations] [crying out] Ah. Ooh. Oh. [exclamations] [groaning] [soft music] [soft music] [soft Irish music] How the hell am I going to explain this? [music playing] - Okay, now it's decision time. So do you wanna look more like Heather Locklear, or one of them girlsfrom the Young and the Restless? - I never watched that program, but Heather Locklear's real pretty. - Heather it is. [laughter] - Oh, thanks again, Ann, for fittin' me in. Especially considerin' I ain't a payin' client. - Ah, you're a friend. That's more important. How is Cody anyway? - Ah... he's... just so preoccupied... with his work these days. - Is that so? - Yep. For instance, the other day, I put on some of that real nice perfume that you lent me. Didn't say a word! Not one word! - Well, it's more serious than I thought. - Hmm! - No matter. I mean, this style is guaranteed to get his mind off them damn lobsters and back on shore, where it belongs. [giggling] [seagulls cawing] - Fire! Fire!!! [men screaming] - Fire! Fire, fire! - I'm comin'! - Where is it?! - Ah! [indistinct chatter] - Okay, stand back. - Back away. - Ow! - It was sawdust. You alright? [Rusty panting] - Um... hurts real bad. - Let's have look-see. - Ah! [groaning] - Uh... uh... Oh... Just... just stay calm. D-don't panic. Paramedics'll be here... real soon. They'll take real good care of ya. - Dale's right. They'll be here real soon. [man]: Think we got her! - Rusty? You mind if I try somethin' real stupid? - You ain't gonna slow dance or nothin' with me, are ya? - No, Rusty, I ain't gonna do that. - Uh... what exactly ya doin' there, Cody? - Not quite sure, Dale. - Well, stop, for godssakes, before you add lockjaw to Rusty's list of conditions. - Well... here goes nothin'. [soft music] - What in the hell was in that can? - Darned if I know. Just glad I still have some left. [siren wailing] [barking] - Dad's here. [barking] - Now, don't say nothin'. Let's see how long it takes him to notice. [barking] - Hey. - Hey, Dad. - What? - You notice anything different about Ma? - Oh, yeah, yeah... What happened to your hair? - It's a new style Ann gave me. Do you like it? - What was wrong with the way it was? [sighing] - Nothin'. Just wanted a little change. You don't like it. - Hmm? No, no, no, no, no. I like it, I like it. - Ma... got too much helpin', not enough hamburger. - Tastes good to me. - So... anythin' interesting happen today? - Yep. - Really? - Yep. - Like what? - Well... yesterday, while I was workin' off of Cuckolds... I found this strange moss in one of my pots. I didn't think much about it, except, uh, it's a colour I ain't never seen before. So I tossed it in that there canand left it in the boat. - Kinda looks like antifreeze to me. - It ain't normal-lookin' moss, I'll give you that. - I probably would've thought no more about it, except today, I accidentally cut off my fingerwith the boat propeller. Since I needed somewhere to keep the finger till I could get to the doctor's, I tossed it in that there can. This is where it gets kinda strange. As soon as my finger hits the moss - poof! - it magically reattaches itself to my hand. Good as new! - Cody Brewer... this is without question the biggest yarn I ever heard. [fork clattering] - Well, I ain't finished yet. When I get back to bait barn,Rusty's gone and burned himself, so I take some more of that moss and rub it on his arm, and, just like that, it heals. - You really expect us to believe you found some moss... that makes fingers grow back and heals burns instantly? That's ridiculous. - I know it is, but it's also true. - Ha! [phone ringing] - Let me see? - Hello. Brewers' residence. - You makin' this up, Dad? - Yeah. [indistinct chatter in kitchen] Yeah. Yeah. - Came right off, went over the side to fish it out. [Martha]: Don't know. Yeah, you too. - Who's that? - Colleen Kendrick. Says Rusty told her the same story about you puttin' moss on his arm and it healin' lickety-split. Said she didn't believe none of it herself, so she went down to the barn... and seen that there had beenindeed a big grease fire inside. Now she's wonderin' what I think and hopin', if you have any moss left,she can have it for her bunions. - I told you, it's all true. - Does anyone else know about this? - Well, Colleen and Rusty and...oh, Dale was there as well. So just them three and us. [lively music] [phone ringing] - Hello? - Hello, it's Colleen. - Hello. - I don't like to gossip, but did you hear about Cody... [phone ringing] - ...had five fingers, then he had four. - Rumour has it it's floatin' around all over... - Kind of a healin' moss. - It was in his lobster pot. [babel] - Goodbye, trench foot! [music fading] [sighing] - So, uh, Dad... you gonna give some moss to Miss Kendrick? - I dunno, Jake. Y'know... bunions don't seem like a very good cause to spend a miracle on. [laughing] - Now you're saying this moss performs miracles. - Well, when Freddy Paxton bowled 242 down the lanes, everybody called that a miracle.[clatter] [barking] If that's a miracle, well... Dammit. [whimpering] - Holy crap. - Jakey, watch your mouth. Holy crap! [Stump growling softly] [Martha]: C'mere. [kissing sounds] - This is unbelievable. - Well... there goes another miracle. [soft music] - How many miracles you figure you got left in there, Dad? - Oh... - Well... I'm not sure, really. Hard to say. Two, maybe three. - Why don't you put it in here for safekeeping? - Thanks. - So how you gonna decide what to spend 'em on? - Well... the way I figure, it's like when you got a silver dollar in your pocket. You know, you hold onto it. You don't spend it on gum or popcorn, or a beer down at the Blue Whale. You save it for somethin' special. - Well, uh, how do you know if something's special? - Uh, you feel it. Yeah, you just feel it. - You think we should get a safe deposit box down at the bank to keep it in? - And pay someone good money to hold our moss? Nope. We are gonna keep it where we can all keep an eye on it. There. [Cody chuckling] [Martha laughing] [soft music] [laughter] [birds cawing] [squawking] - Hey, Cody. - Good mornin', Rusty. Whatcha doin'? - Oh, I thought I'd bring your bait down for ya. - You didn't need to do that, Rusty. - I figure... it's the least I could do. - Well, thanks. Uh, how much do I owe ya? - Oh, this is on the house. You gotta remember who your friends are. Right? Right, Cody? - Yeah. Yes, you do. Bubba? Is that you? - Uh, yeah. Heya, Cody. So, uh... is it true? - Is what true? - About the moss. - Yeah, it's true. - Folks say you caught it out at Cuckolds. - That's right. - Other folks sayin'... this moss can do miracles. - Yeah? - You're not tryin' to make us look silly, are ya, Cody? - How can I make you look silly,Bubba? Hmm? - Uh, yeah. [chuckling] - In its simplest definition, a trigonometric function is one of the many functions that relates one non-right angle... of a right triangle... to the ratio of the length of any two sides of that triangle. - Hey, Brewer. My dad says that your fathermade up some type of bogus story about findin' some type ofmiracle moss in his lobster pot. - For your information, he didn't make it up. - Oh, is that a fact? - Yeah, that's a fact. - If it really does perform miracles, then, uh, maybe it'll make you a new pair of pants. Ones that actually go down to your ankles. Or is that too big of a miracle? - Shut up. - Mr. Brewer, do you have something you would like to share with the rest of the class? - No. - And, Mr. Brock, I know that my classroom rulesshould be of no surprise to you, seeing you are in my class for the second year in a row. [laughter] Alright, everyone, let's look over here, please. [soft music] - Hey, you guys, it's Brewer! - It's Cody! [indistinct shouting] - Cody, where's the spot?! - What the hell is this? [honking] [indistinct chatter] Couldn't get much fishin' done here today. [motor revving] [soft music] [motor stalling] Not again! [sighing] [motor sputtering] - Ah... Sh... [grumbling] [soft music] [sighing] - I'll tow your boat back to your house in the mornin'. Edith and I, we're just headin' somewhere now. - Thanks, Walter. Thanks for helpin' me out. - Don't mention it. - Hello, Cody. - Hey, Edith. - We're goin' to the doctor's. Cody. Walter's havin' heart palpitations. - Is that true, Walter? [scoffing] - You know what he needs? Some of that miracle moss--- Never you mind about me. Cody. I'm fine. Just worried about them. - Ugh. I'll see ya, Walter. See ya, Edith. - Good luck. - Heya, Cody. How you doin'? - Well, let me see. My engine quit, only baited half my pots, and, uh, the guy with the biggest heart in town just told me it ain't workin' right. How do you think I'm doin'? - Well, I imagine a whole heck of a lot better than them other 62 people who never did find no moss at Cuckolds Rock today. - The difference is, I wasn't lookin' for moss, Dale.I was lookin' for lobsters. - All the same, don't suppose you wouldn't happen to have no extra of that there green stuff to spare? Sure could use some. - Me, too. - Uh, yeah, me three. - What exactly you need it for, Dale? - My shin splintses. [hissing] - Norm? - Halitosis. You know, bad breath? - It's true, he does got that. - How about you, Bubba? - Uh, well... I, uh... I, uh... I got a third... third nipple... here. - Well, fellas, I, uh... I ain't got that much moss, and it don't seem to me like any of you guys need a miracle that bad. Hmm? See ya. - If you need a ride, Cody, I got a new lilac air-freshener in my garbage truck. - You know what, Norm? I think I'll walk. [slow bluesy music] [honking] - Well, well. [grunting] Oh, if it isn't Cody Brewer. [chuckling] - Howdy, Mayor. - Heh. Hey, hop in. I'll drive ya out to the point. - No, thanks. - Well, what are ya, on some new kinda health kick? Ya burnin' up calories walkin' in your lobster boots? - No, just don't wanna hear about your bunion, your ingrown toenail, your third nipple. - Why on earth would I tell ya about that? - Because like everybody else inthis town, you think if I hear about your particular ailment, I'll give ya some of that moss. - Ailment! I don't need your moss for my ailments. Look at me! I'm fit as a fiddle![cackling] C'mon, go into the car. I wanna tell you something. I got a terrific idea. C'mon. [slow bluesy music] Listen, I got this terrific plan. It's called Moss World! [laughing] All I need from you is a little moss, just like... No, no, just a little bit of moss just to get started. Jeez! I'm telling ya... I'm talkin' about rides and restaurants, and, of course, moss rocks! Where for a small fee, folks'll be able to pull moss-filled traps like the famous Cody Brewer! Just think what it'll do for the town! [barking] [groaning] - Hey. - Hey. - You're back late. [Cody sighing] - My engine broke, so I started to walk. Then I got a ride. That didn't work out, so I walked some more. - Well, I'm just glad you're home. There's a whole bunch of people lookin' for you and your moss. You ready? - No, but tell me anyway. - Okay. Carl Hackett wants it for his back pain. Sally Leeds for her warts. Pat McGowan wants it for his chickenpox. Cliff Eacott for his dysentery. Edith Hogshead wants to remind you about Walter's heart palpitations. And Morty Thorpe, he's in the living room, wants to talk to you in person. - Nobody's ever wanted to talk to me in person. - You never had somethin' they wanted so bad before. - Hey there, Morty. - Hi, Cody. [sighing] - Well, I've heard everybody else's reason for why they want the moss. What's yours? - Oh, it's, uh... ...kinda complicated. Can't you trust me? - Morty... there's two miracles left in that jar, maybe three, and you want me trust ya? - I wish you would. - Well, I can't. Now, if you want me to give ya a piece, you better give me a good reason. - Alright! - Uh, wh-wh-wh-what are ya doin'? - I got impotence, Cody! - Jeez, Morty, I don't need to know a thing like that! Pull up your pants! - Oh. [lively fiddle music] S-sorry, Cody. I... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [music fading] - Thinkin' about who deserves the moss the most? - Oh... no, I'm thinkin' about my engine. [sighing] Tryin' to figure out what could be wrong. Maybe the head gasket's blown, or... ...maybe the impeller. - I've got somethin' that might take your mind off that engine. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. You give me one minute. [sighing] [groaning] [snoring] [soft music] [lowering volume] [bell tolling] - Hey, Brewer, bring me some of that moss! C'mon, Cody! [radio]: ...Prospect Radio, with another dedication goin' out to Cody Brewer. Kid's got the pinkeye. - Well, I'll be. Heya, Cody. - Hey, Stanley. Havin' a little engine trouble. Reckon it's my fuel hose. Ya got any eighth-of-an-inch rubber-coated? - Your old outboard givin' ya trouble, is she? - Ah, you could say that. - Wait here. - Ninety-three? - Ooh, '93. That's a bad year. That's the year they changed the whole lower unit. Come to think of it, that's the year Thelma left me for that carpenter up in Eastwick. Oh, well. Let's see what I got out back. - Hey, Cody, how's it goin'? - Hey, Gene. [chuckling] - You're in luck, Cody. Got one left. - Ah, great. What do I owe ya? - Well, I could sell it to ya for $1.22, only if you're interested in some kinda barter. You could bring it in, I could fix it myself. - Barter? I didn't think you boys liked lobster. - We don't, but we sure could use some of that miracle moss. - In order to fix our weight problem. The doctor figures we got under-active thyroid glands. - That's what he said. - Well... I'm no PhD, but, uh, d'you ever think that maybe your thyroids would be more active... if they weren't always digestin' donuts? - Never thought about it. - Yeah, never thought about it. - So can I have some moss? - Boys, if you don't mind, uh, I think I'll hold on to the mossand pay you the $1.22. - Okay, but if ya change your mind, let me know. We'll even throw in a free lawnmower repair. - Yeah. - Hey. Thanks, boys. See ya later. - See ya, Cody. [soft guitar music] - Oh, hey there, Cody. - Hey, Ned. What's up? - Oh, just tryin' to keep a modicum of order in this town that's gone moss crazy. - Yeah, tell me about it. - You, uh, hold that for me? - Sure. You really drink two of these at one time? - Ever try one of these iced cappuccinos? - Can't say that I have. - Well... best just keepin' it that way, then. See ya later, Cody. Duty calls. - Yeah. See ya, Ned. - I think I'd name it Shelly Island, 'cause there'd be shells and I'd be sharing with... [flushing] - Oh. Well. Wow. I type mine on an IBM, but looks like you typed yours on an I-be-poor. [chuckling] So ya got something for me, Brewer? - Timmy, what could I possibly have that you'd want? - It's not what you have.It's the moss that your dad has. - What makes you think he'd give it to you? - Well, it's not for me. See, Taz here has a little bit of an acne problem. And them school photos are comin' up next week. - My dad ain't gonna give any to Taz just 'cause he's got acne. - Then you better steal it. 'Cause if Taz don't look like he belongs on the cover of Teen Beat magazine by the end of next week... then you're gonna get it. - I don't even think a miracle could get Taz's face on the cover of National Geographic. - I'm serious, Brewer. It's not about why I want the moss, it's about you gettin' it for me, okay? Okay?! [school bell ringing] - Think he'll bring ya the moss? - He will if he knows what's good for him. - Mm. Good. [seagulls cawing] [flies buzzing] Why'd they send it back? - Oh, the woman didn't likethe shrimp touching the scallop. [Martha laughing] How you and Cody doin' these days? - Mm. We're alright. Doin' a little better these days... and these nights. - How long you been married now,Martha? Fifteen years? - Twenty. - That's a long time. [Martha laughing] - Yeah. - Hey, uh, let me ask you... somethin'. You still in love with him? - Cody? Of course I still love him. - I know you love him, but are you in love with him. - Yeah. I just... I don't know. I just sorta feel like I'm in this current... and I'm tryin' to stay close to the shore, you know? I can see the lighthouse... The light's gettin'... fainter and fainter. And if the tide don't change soon... I just need something to change the tide. Eddie, you still ain't asked me nothin' about the moss. [laughing] - I ain't interested in the moss, Martha. [waves thundering onto beach] - What are all you doin'? - Cody doesn't think we're good enough for the miracle moss. - Uh, yeah. He's just hoardin' it all for himself. - Uh, yeah. - That's not true. Just doesn't think your reasons are good enough. - Not good enough. - That what you Brewers think? - It's not that! - Who are you to be judgin' wh-wh-who needs it? - Yeah, who are you? - I'll tell you who I am. I'm Martha Brewer. Now that you know, you can tell me who you are, 'cause frankly, I don't recognize most of you anymore. Dale, are you someone whose shinsplints keep you from walkin'? - And what about you, Bubba? Are you someone who genuinely needs a miracle? And you, Colleen, are your bunions really that bad? - I can't wear my favourite sandals anymore. - Everybody just go home! Oh, just go home. What is it, Mayor? - I just wanted you to give this to Cody. And, uh, tell him I-I need him to sign a waiver so we can sell these in the gift shop. And I'll need a little moss so we can start the construction. - I'll see that he gets it. I gotta go. - But we'll... we'll do real well, I think. - What's that? - It's you. - Wha... [chuckling] Two days ago, I was a lobsterman. Now I'm a stuffed toy? - This whole thing's gone too far. What the hell's wrong with everybody? Somethin's gotta change around here. Your dinner's in the oven. - Ain't you hungry? - I ate at work. [sighing] [seagulls cawing] - Hello, Cody. - Hello, Edith. - Nobody was up at the house, so I just walked down. - Oh. Always nice to see ya. - I'm... here to ask a favour. - Save your breath. If it's about Walter, he told me to pay no concern to his heart palpitations. - He ain't havin' them palpitations no more. - Well, that's good. - He died of a heart attack this mornin'. Good news is, he's only been dead... two hours, 18 minutes. Cody, do you think that moss of yours could bring him back after such a short time? - Tell you the truth, I... I don't know. - You willin' to try? [birdsong] [distant barking] - Thanks for holdin' off on the embalmin', Hank. - Well, I ain't never done this before. Once we get a customer, we tend to keep him. [sighing] - You've always been a good friend, Walter. I should've given you some of this before. Let's hope it works now. - Walter, you still dead? - Are you sure you put enough on? - I used the same amount I did on myself and Rusty. - No offence, Cody, but in my professional opinion, this is a much bigger job. - To tell you the truth... ...it's about all we can afford to spare, not knowin' if it'll work or not. - Maybe it just needs a little more time to take effect. - I'm afraid if... Walter was gonna rise... he would've done so by now, Edith. I'm sorry. - I'm gonna miss him. - We're all gonna miss him. [Edith sniffling] - Got somethin' in there for me,Brewer? - My History book. - Figured you had my moss. You do have my moss, don't ya? - No. - Alright, um... I'm gonna give you one more day,Brewer. One more. That's it. I need that moss, okay? - Hmm. - What's the matter? - The electric bill's overdue. I figure if you don't pull some pots soon, we'll be cookin' over a can of Sterno. - Hmm. [knocking] - Jake, can you get the door, please? - Hello. Is your father here? - Yeah. Ma, uh... - Hello. My name's Darryl Stern. This is my wife, Samantha. - How do you do? - Could we have a moment of your time? [fork clattering] - Uh... Ahem. Yeah, sure. - Sorry, we ran out of milk. - Oh, this is just fine. - Mr. Brewer, I head the homeopathic division of a company called Trimorez Laboratories, and we're very interested in acquiring some of that moss you found. - What a surprise. Huh. - Yes, I imagine you have quite a few suitors. You do have some of that left, don't you, Mr. Brewer? - Well, not much, but, uh, yeah, I-I got some. - Do you mind if I take a look at it? - Sure. Suit yourself. It's right over there. - Oh. Amazing. Truly amazing. You know, the Abenaki Indians who originally inhabited this coastline once wrote about a moss that could cure all ills? - No, I didn't know that. - We assumed they were talking about ginseng or eucalyptus, but, uh... [chuckling] Mr. Brewer, I'll cut to the chase. You see, we bring drugs to market - pain relievers, anti-inflammatories, acid neutralizers, you name it - and when we're able to exploit aparticular pharmaceutical niche, well, we charge a premium for our drugs, whose cost is largely absorbed by the large health-insurance companies. You can only imagine what this moss could do to an industry like ours. - Yep... I think so. - Which is why I'm prepared to pay you... half-a-million dollars to keep it from coming to market. [scoffing] - Ma, we're gonna be rich. We're gonna be rich. - Well, not yet, Jakey. Your dad said he had to think about it. - What's there to think about, Dad? - Well, there's a lot, Jake. A lot, yeah. I'm not sayin' we... we don't...take Mr. Stern up on his offer, but... it's not as simple as it sounds. - Sounds pretty simple to me, Dad. - When do you figure you'll decide? - Well, I dunno. I don't wanna rush into anything. A... day or two? - Once we get the money, I'm going straight down to Brock's and gettin' 10 new pairs of pants. - So it's still just sittin' there on top of the TV set? - Yeah. - Man, if that were me, I'd rub some on Shelly O'Connor, make her have the biggest crush in history on me. - You need a love potion, Mike. - You don't know that. [birdsong] [ship's horn blowing in distance] - Mike, you miss your dad? - Sometimes so much. I still don't understand how aguy who lobstered his whole life never learned how to swim. - I don't understand how people who grew up here never got out when they could. - Yeah. - But that ain't gonna happen to us, Mike. We ain't gonna make the same mistakes our parents did. First chance we get, travel as far away from this place as we can. All the way to Vermont or somethin'. Someplace where they ain't nevereven heard of a lobster. - Can Shelly come too? - Only if my dad discovers some love potion off Cuckolds Rocks. - Hey. Brewer. You got my miracle moss for me? - My dad ain't givin' it to you. He's sellin' it to a company for half-a-million dollars. [laughter] - Yeah, that's a good one, Brewer. - Why don't you just admit what everyone knows already? That your dad's a total loser. Always has been, always will be. And you know what else? You're gonna grow up to be just like him. [groaning] Oh, God. Oh, God. [whimpering and coughing] [panting and coughing] [wheezing] [seagulls cawing] - You decided yet, Dad? - Decided what? - Sellin' the moss. - Not today, Jake.- Why can't you do it now, Dad? Before somethin' bad happens, like it always does. - Nothin' bad's gonna happen. - Yes, it is, Dad. And you know it. - Why is your shirt ripped? - Got in a fight. - Why the heck d'you do that? - Timmy Brock said somethin' about ya. Said you're a loser and I'm gonna be just like... He said you're a loser. - I don't care what some brattysmart-mouth kid thinks about me. Why do you?! - 'Cause I'm sick of takin' it, Dad. I'm sick of havin' to make excuses for my clothes, and my house. [sniffling] And... And my father. - What did you say? - You know, Mom can pretend you ain't a loser, Dad, but I can't anymore. We could have half-a-million dollars, Dad. Half a million! I could go to school with new pants for once in my damn life. Mom could quit that stupid job down at the wharf. But no, you had to think about it. You know what to get, Dad? What we always get. Nothin'. [soft music] [soft music] - You think Jake's right. You think I'm gonna mess this up? - No matter how it ends... ...I know you'll do what you think is right. You always do. Gotta go. Picked up an extra dinner shift to help with the bills. [sighing] [phone ringing] - Brewer's. [mayor]: Hello there, Cody. How are you today? - I've been better. Great, great. Well, I'm just callin' to see whether you're ready to go into business together with this Moss World. - Not today, Mayor. Look, look, I-I gotta go. Okay? [sighing] [phone ringing] Brewer's. - Hello, Mr. Brewer. It's Darryl Stern from Trimorez. So are you ready to become a very wealthy man? - Well, not today, sir. - Y-you know, this money's burning a hole in the pocket of my lab coat, so whenever you think you're ready to make a deal-- - I'll let you know. - Okay, then. [phone ringing] - Ah, c... Brewer's! - Cody. Morty Thorpe. I still can't get the little fella to salute. - No, Morty, not today, not tomorrow, not next week, not next year, not ever! Jake? [eerie music] [soft music] [birdsong] [Cody sighing] - Huh. I told you somethin' bad would happen. - Jakey. I gotta go to work. You should call the sheriff. - Martha, can I ask you a question? - What's that? - If I had taken... that money for the moss... ...would that have made you happy? - Cody, when we got married, I never expected to be rich. I expected to be loved, that's it. Sure, there were a couple of dresses down at Brock's that were real pretty. And some pearl earrings I seen in the consignment store that I would've liked to have bought. Since the only person I cared about impressin' was you, I didn't think much about them things. Especially since I never thought I needed anything else other than myself... ...to get your attention. Not until recently, anyway. - You should've bought them earrings. You deserve somethin' nice like that. I don't need no earrings, Cody. [sighing] [recording]: Comment vous appelez-vous? What is your name? - Comment vous appelez-vous? What is your name? - Je ne comprends pas. I do not understand. - Uh... je ne comprende pas. [woman]: Car 3, come in, car 3. Are you there, Sheriff? - Yeah, I'm here. - We have a 459. Someone stole Cody Brewer's moss. - Je dois aller à la salle de bain. I have to go to the bathroom. [woman]: Pardon? Come in, car 3. Is that you, Sheriff? - I have to go to the bathroom. - Uh, nothin'. Uh, I'm on it. [siren wailing] [music] [drilling] [power running down] [clicking] [sighing] - Argh. [clicking] [sighing] Bastards. Cut us off. - Hey there, Cody. I rushed right over. - Not today! - I figure if I'm gonna find your moss, today'd be a good day to start. - Oh. Sorry, Ned, I'm all wound up. - So, uh, you have any idea who might want to steal said moss? - Yeah! Everyone. - Well, in a case like this, time is of the essence. Of course, I never really had a case like this before. With a bike or some lobster pots, it's, uh, it's usually good to find 'em quickly. - Great. - You okay, Cody? - Uh, I'm... Uh, I... I thought if I could hold on to that damn moss for somethin' really special... I could make a difference. I was wrong. I was wrong about everything. - Well... let me tell you a little story. There was once a wise old man who lived atop the highest mountain in his land, and the people from the village,they would trek up the mountain, and seek his counsel and guidance. Anyway, there was this fella name of Ram Chandra, he climbed up the mountain, and when he got to the top, tired and hungry, the wise man asked him: "How can I help you, my son?" And Ram Chandra said that he had made a series of unwise business investments that left him broke. And he added that his children didn't respect him anymore. And it was only now that he reached old age that he realized he had missed the best years of his life working late into the nights. Then Ram Chandra asked the wise old man: "How can I solve my problems?" The wise man, he paused for a long moment, then he said, "Everyone is born with 99 problems, and that man I see sittin' before me has 100. Ram Chandra said that he didn't understand. And the wise man told him: "Your extra problem is that you think you can live with no problems." - Ned... what the hell does that mean? - It means that life is filled with, uh, a certain amount of sufferin' and hardship, and that findin' your moss ain't necessarily the same thing as findin' happiness. - Before we get started today, I have some bad news. There's no easy way to say this, so I'm just gonna say it. Timmy Brock has been diagnosed with stomach cancer. I'm gonna postpone our lesson on polynomial identities long enough to pass around this card for everyone to sign. I'm gonna start it with Shelly. It says, "The best thing about bad times is discovering how many good friends you have." I don't think truer words... have ever been said. [beeping] - Now, Mrs. Brock, keep in mind that with a disease like this, things do change. Unfortunately, right now, the prognosis is not good. We've given him something for the pain and something that will help him sleep. But the primary tumour has metastasized and is now involving the liver and the lungs. - Metastasized? What does that mean? I don't understand what that means. - It simply means that the cancer is spreading. - Is he gonna die, Doctor? - I really can't answer that, ma'am. We're doing the best we can. - What we need is some of that miracle moss Cody Brewer found. - Livin' out at Prospect, there are two things I've learned to never trust: the weather in November and whatever comes out of a lobsterman's mouth. Timmy doesn't need some fantasy moss. He needs the best medicine money can buy, and we will pay whatever it costs. [indistinct PA announcement] - That's some news about Timmy, huh? - Yeah. - You should've written somethin' in the card. - What was I supposed to say? Get well soon? Hope ya feel better? Can't wait to see ya? - He could die, Jake. You get that, right? - Yeah. What I'd say? So long. - You know, Jake, one day you'll lose someone you care about, and then you'll feel differently. - I still won't give a crap about Timmy Brock. - You know, Jake, sometimes you can be a real loser. [motor stalling] - Oh, come on. Come on. Come on! Oh, goddamn!! [sighing] Not the hoses, not the seals, not the flywheel! Not the plugs, not the impeller! [sniffling] Yeah! Let's pull some pots. [Irish music] - Sheriff. - Dale. - What brings you by here? - Oh, just onan investigative trail of sorts. - Uh-huh. And that led you to my work shed? - Well, I haven't found a trail per se... yet. You'll be the first one to know if I do. - Uh-huh. In the meantime, would you mind movin' that booty over there so I can stack these here pots? - Uh... sure. - Ah!! - What's the matter, Dale? [hissing] - Ah... it's my shin splintses. Oh... - Oh, you still got 'em? - Of course I still got 'em! [groaning] - That's... that's interestin'. - Ah...! - You should look after that. - Ah... - Gene, Stanley. - Hey there, Sheriff. - What brings you by? - Oh, I just thought you boys might help me finish this, uh, baker's dozen. - Wouldn't say no to that invitation. - So, uh, you boys give up on your weight loss? - No. - Really? - Although we were thinkin' of askin' our mother for one of those stationary exercise bikes... for our birthday. - Oh, yeah. Well, you enjoy. - Sheriff. [music] - Hello, Sheriff. What can I help you with? - I was just wonderin' if you ever got a sample of that moss you was after. - No, I haven't. Uh, is there, uh, somethin' you know that I don't? - Not sure. You speak French. Mr. Stern? - Un petit peu. - Well, I guess you don't, then.Bye, Mr. Stern. Hey, young fella, another one of these sweet babies! [soft music] [bell dinging] [soft music] [car door closing] [engine starting] [soft music] [cutlery tinkling] [Martha laughing] - Oh, my. - What this place is missing is hats. [laughing] - That's so silly. [indistinct chatter] Well, it looks good on you. [music] [Irish music] - Howdy, Sheriff. [music] - Aha. [birdsong] [music] [music fading] - They turned off the power. - Yep. I, uh, figured... it oughta beenough to get it turned back on. - Where'd you get all the money? - Oh, fixed the engine, pulled my pots. Jake's in his room. Ain't said two words to me all day. Martha... you know I ain't no good with words. But I... ...I hope this comes out right,'cause... ...I figure things bein' as they are, I'd only get one chance. Now, I-I-I realize... ...I ain't everything you ever wanted in a husband. I don't drive a fancy car, work in big office buildin'. And I ain't so good with my feelings. Sharin' 'em and all. I don't tell you how... how beautiful you look when you're sleepin' next to me or... how I still get that... little feelin'... there... ...every time I think about ya. I don't tell ya none of that. But, Martha, you... you are what matters most to me in the whole world. That's why when I'm out there pullin' pots... I'm not wishin' I was someone else, some doctor or lawyer. 'Cause, you see... I already got everything I ever dreamed of. I don't want nobody else's life,Martha, because it can never compare with the one I got. Just know that I love you, Martha. Know that I love ya more than... anyone else ever will. More than anyone else ever can. - Thank you, Cody. Thank you. What changed the tide? [Martha sniffling and laughing] [sniffling] [kissing] - And so it is with a heavy heart... that we lower Walter Hogshead, a man of the sea, to his final resting place... in the earth. Let us pray. Our heavenly Father... ...grant that we may fish until our dying days. And when you come for the final pullin' of the pots, may we be judged in your infinite mercy as big enough to keep. Amen. [all]: Amen. - Uh, hey there, Brewers. It was a... lovely service. - Yeah, it was nice. - Uh, Cody, maybe you'd be interested in, uh, takin' a ride with me. I think I know where we can find your moss. - Really? Alright, uh, I'll see ya back at the house. Hmm? - So why's the sheriff so fired up? - You sure it's him? - Well, he's the only one on the list that didn't check out. - God, I hope there's some left. - After all you've been through, I'm surprised you want that moss back. - Spent a lot of time thinkin' about just that. I really wanted to do what was best with that silly moss. In the end, all I've done is ignore what was truly important. - Well, that's... that's an easy mistake. - Of all the hundreds of people in the world, why did I have to be the one who found it? - Well, maybe you didn't. Maybe it found you. [music] [laughter and exclamations] [woman and man exclaiming] [both crying out] [man screaming] - Whoo! - You're gonna stay here, Cody. Could get messy. [exclamations] [bedsprings squeaking] [man crying out] - Hallelujah!!! I am reborn! Could there be a more rewardin' miracle? - Yeah, a miracle that's gonna keep you from this arrest. - Come on, Sheriff, you're not gonna arrest me for tryin' to reconsummate my marriage, are ya? - I guess that'll work as a confession. - Sorry, Cody. But the little tinker had been outta commission for 45 years. Ya hear that, Thelma?! Had been! [laughing] - Morty, how could ya? - It isn't as if I took it all, Cody. Heck, most of it's still up there right on your television set. - Alright, Morty, keep on goin'.- Yeah, I'll keep on goin'! You can take my word for it! [laughing and whooping] Bye, honey. - Car. - Don't forget visitin' day! Just, uh, one more question, Mrs. Thorpe. Uh, since Morty here won't tell us where he stashed the moss, perhaps you will. - Morty's telling the truth, Sheriff. There wasn't no jar of moss. He brought that stuff home in a shot glass. See, he only needed a small amount of the stuff. Let's just sayit wasn't that big of a miracle, if you know what I mean. - Yes, thank you, Mrs. Thorpe. Well, looks like we got here is a second perpetrator. - A what? - Thing is, I checked out almost everybody in town and... they all seem clean. - You sure? - In my line of business, Cody, you learn to trust your instincts. Now, the moss that Morty used to fix his little problem may be gone, but my gut tells me someone's holdin' a mayonnaise jar somewhere else. Now, if we find your jar... maybe we'll find one more miracle. - Ned, you drop me at the point? - Yeah, certainly. - Jake, you here?! Martha, you seen Jake around? - No, not for a while. Said he had to go do somethin', but back in a bit. - He say where he was goin'? - No. Why, Cody? What's wrong? Did you get the moss back? - Nah. Not yet. So... d'you get what you wanted? Why, Jake? Why would you do this? Can you tell me what you used it for? Well... I sure hope it was worth it. - Me, too. [birdsong] [soft music] [sighing] [dinging] - Good mornin', Cody. - Hey, Hal. What brings you all the way out here? - Timmy's cancer's gone. - It is? Ah, well, that's... that's really great news. Great. - Doctors are callin' it a miracle. Said just before the symptoms disappeared... Timmy was havin' his dinner... when he took a sip of chocolate milk and... a bright white light appeared. You wouldn't happen to know anythin' about that, would you, Cody? - No. Sorry, Hal, no, I don't know nothin' about it. [chuckling] How about you, Jake? - Nah, nothin'. - See ya, Hal. - See ya. Cody. - That's some story Mr. Brock had. - Yeah, some story alright. You know, Dad... I was goin' to get us some money. Just then I started thinkin'-- - Hey, there's our buoy. - Let me help you with that, Dad. - Hey. [grunting] Come on. Argh. Okay. Okay. - This is where you found the miracle moss? - This is the spot. - I wonder if there's any more down there. - You never know. Probably oughta keepour pots here just in case, huh? - Yeah. 'Course, the fishin' might be better on the north side. - Yep. - Well, if it were up to me,I think I'd move 'em over there. - Then maybe we oughta. [Cody chuckling] [squawking] [squawking] - Damn seagulls. [motor stalling] [motor starting] - Ah... [soft Irish music] [lively music] [soft music] [Irish music]
