Ripped, OCR, corrected & synched by Fingersmaster. Enjoy! Thank you, Jason. - On time. - You bet. Link. Link Appleyard! Miss Hallie. Hello, Marshal. - Howdy, Mr. Senator. -No, no. Ranse. Ranse. Ranse. Sure glad you could come. Well, your wire caught us in St. Louis. I want to thank you. It's... My buckboard's right over there. Here, now, Jason, give me that box. You knew all the time they were coming. Well, now that's the first time in your life you ever kept a secret! - Blabbermouth! -Who was that, Jason? Anybody I could get a line or two in the paper about? A line or two? Why, you blasted young fool, that's Senator Stoddard and his wife. Why, you could fill your newspaper with them! Hi, Lydia, this is Charlie Hasbrouck. Emergency. Look, call the office and tell the editor that Senator Stoddard and his wife just got off the train. Yeah, that's right! Thanks, honey. Hey, bub! That's a nickel. Charge it to the Shinbone Star! Hey, Senator! Senator Stoddard? Ma'am. I wonder, could you give me an interview? Exclusive, like, you know, a scoop. Shinbone Star. Well, now, son, I... All right. All right, I'll give the interview. But only for one reason. One reason. Button Peabody. Founder, publisher, editor-in-chief of the Shinbone Star, once fired me. My editor will sure fire me if I don't get this interview. Is it true, Senator, that you're going to... Here he comes now. Senator Stoddard, this is a surprise. And an honor, sir. - I'm Maxwell Scott, editor of the Star. -Well! How do you do, Mr. Scott? This is Mrs. Stoddard there. A pleasure, ma'am. Well, what brings you back to town, sir? ls it true that you're going to run for... No, now, hold on, hold on, Mr. Scott. Now, who am I giving this interview to, you or this young fellow here? Who asked me first, by the way. I sure did, Mr. Scott. Well, Charlie, if you're a good reporter, you'll invite the folks over to our office, -get them out of the sun and dust. -That's right. He's right, son. Best way to make a man talk's to make him comfortable. Well, Hallie Hess. Back in business again. Politics. Link, why don't you take Hallie for a little ride around the town? Lot of changes, huh? I'll go over with these fellas, mend a few political fences. I notice you're not wearing the star. Oh, shucks, Miss Hallie, they haven't elected me town marshal for a dog's age. I reckon the only one of us from the old days still working steady is the senator. The place has sure changed. Churches, high school, shops. Well, the railroad done that. Desert's still the same. The cactus rose is in blossom. Maybe... Maybe you'd like to take a ride out desert way and maybe look around. Maybe. You knew where I wanted to go, didn't you? Well, you said you wanted to see the cactus blossoms. There's his house down there, what's left of it. Blossoms all around it. He never did finish that room he started to build on, did he? No... Well, you know all about that. There's a lovely one there. Well, gentlemen, I promised myself this trip, I would not talk politics, and look here, that's just about all I've been doing. But, Ranse, surely you're going up to Capitol City and talk to the assembly? No, not this trip, Charlie. No, this is purely personal. Purely personal? Well, Mr. Senator, "purely personal" isn't good enough for my readers. Just why did you come to Shinbone? - No mystery, is there? -No. No, there's no mystery. I'm here to go to a funeral. A funeral? Who's dead, sir? No, sir, I... A man by the name of Tom Doniphon. There's my good wife. I'll... I've enjoyed the visit, gentlemen. Tom Doniphon? Hello, Clute. Why, Ranse! Ransom Stoddard. And Miss Hallie. Well gosh, Senator, I didn't think that... Link. Why didn't you let me know they was coming? Gosh, I'd've had a real bang-up funeral. Folks from all over everywhere would've come. The county's going to bury him, you know. Gosh, I ain't going to make a nickel out of it. Pompey? Miss Hallie. Pompey, I'm sorry. Maybe you'd like to... Where are his boots? Well, I thought... Well, they was an awful nice pair of boots, almost brand-new, -and I thought... -Put his boots on, Clute. And his gun belt, and his spurs. He didn't carry no handgun, Ranse. He didn't for years. Yeah, sure. Sir, I don't wish to intrude, but a United States Senator is news. I'm the editor of a newspaper with a statewide circulation. I've got a responsibility to know why you came all the way down here to bury a man. Now, you can't just say his name was Tom Doniphon and leave it at that. Who was Tom Doniphon? He was a friend, Mr. Scott. And we'd like to be left alone. Scott, let's go. Let's... I'm sorry, Senator. That's not enough. I have a right to have the story. Yes, I guess maybe you have. Course, this story not only concerns me. Old Pompey in there, Link, they were part of it. But I suppose I'm the only one who can tell it through. I read about the old days in Shinbone in the paper's files. - There was no mention of... -You're a young man. Young man. You only know it firsthand since the railroad came through. A lot different then. A lot different before, Mr. Scott. A lot different. First time I came to Shinbone, I came by stagecoach. It was a lot like that one right there. Well, it... Could be the same one. Could be the same one. "Overland"? Say, I think it is the same one. Well, I declare. I declare. I was just a youngster, fresh out of law school, bag full of law books and my father's gold watch, 14.80 dollars in cash. I had taken Horace Greeley's advice literally. "Go West, young man, go West, "and seek fame, fortune, adventure." Stand and deliver. Shotgun, shuck your shells. Throw down that cash box. NOW! All right, get the passengers out of the coach. Looks like slim passenger pickings, but lift their wallets anyway. I'll take that pin, too. No, please. Please! My dead husband gave it to me. Please! A widder woman, huh? I'll take it anyway! Will you take your hands off? What kind of men are you? This kind, dude. Now what kind of man are you, dude? I'm an attorney at law! And I'm duly licensed for the territory! And you may have us in your guns now, but I'll see you in jail for this! Jail? - Stop it! -Get him out of here! - You'll kill him! -Get in that coach. Go on, move! Get in there! You, too! Come on! Inside! - He'll die out there! -We'll send him flowers. Chico, cut the leaders! Get going! Here, put that stuff in here and get to your horses. Hurry. Books? Law? Lawyer, huh? Well, I'll teach you law. Western law. Come on. Let's get out of here. Come on. Come on, Valance! Hallie. Hallie! Wake up, gal! Tom Doniphon! 5:30 a.m. in the morning. What's the matter with you? We've got a man down here ambushed. And bushed. Like to die if he don't get some caring for. - It's the man from the holdup. -That's right. How did you know? Stagecoach stopped by last night to notify the marshal. Link Appleyard? Well, don't stand there gossiping. Get him inside. Pompey! Think you can make it, pilgrim? Pick him up, Pompey. Put him on the couch. Tom? He's hurt real bad. Thanks, Pompey. Poor man. Beaten, whipped, and kicked. And just for trying to protect a woman. How's that again? Stage driver told us all about it. Well, Pompey. Looks like we got ourselves a ladies' man. Hallie, we... - You get some bandage. -But... I'll take care of him. Hey, pilgrim, you're going to need a couple of stitches. Pompey, go find Doc Willoughby. If he's sober, bring him back. Nora, sorry to bust in on you like this. - He's in trouble. -Poor man! Such a beating. This is just simply terrible! By golly, I'm going to get the marshal. You want coffee? I make some breakfast. Hallie. Take her easy there, pilgrim. You all right? Here we are. Drink this. That coffee? Ja, coffee. And aquavit. That's Swedish brandy. That's good for you. No, no. I don't care for that-. Oh, no. Here. You must drink that. That make you feel better. It ain't mannerly out West, let a fella drink by himself. All right if I smoke, ain't it? Sure, go right ahead. Good. Now you will feel stronger. Thank you, ma'am. They took my watch. My money's gone. Every cent I had in the world. Well, don't fret about that, pilgrim. You can eat here until you get back on your feet. My credit still good, Nora? Yeah, Tom. Lie down. Please lie down. No, not now. Not now. I... I've got something to do. I've got something to do. What'd you say his name was? The man with the silver-knobbed whip? I said Liberty Valance. But if that's what you gotta do, you better start packing a handgun. A gun? I don't want a gun. I don't want a gun. I don't want to kill him. I want to put him in jail. Well, I know those law books mean a lot to you, but not out here. Out here, a man settles his own problems. No, but... Do you know what you're saying to me? You know, you're saying just exactly what Liberty Valance said. What kind of a community have I come to here? You all seem to know about this fella Liberty Valance. He's a no good, gun-packing, murdering thief, but the only advice you can give to me is to carry a gun. Well, I'm a lawyer! Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law. And the law is the only... The only... A little law and order around Shinbone wouldn't hurt anyone. All right, Hallie. Nobody seems to want you... Well! Here comes Mr. Law and Order himself. The man is hurt bad! I don't know what you're dragging me over here for, Peter. Ain't being up all night on account of this holdup business, and... - Who's this? -The man from the holdup. I knew I shouldn't have come over here. Now wait a minute, Marshal. Now see here, Tom, if a man's got a formal complaint to make, he should make it to me. All he wants you to do is put Liberty Valance in jail. Yeah, Liberty... Liberty Valance? Do you think I'm crazy? Now, Tom, let me out of here! Hallie seems to think he's right. You better listen. He's a lawyer, you know. Somebody better listen to somebody about Liberty Valance! Eyes he's got, like icicles. - Mama! Liberty Valance... -You shut up. As long as he behaves himself in this town, I ain't got no... Jurisdiction. What he said is right. I ain't got none of it. Now, you all know that I'm only the town marshal, and what Liberty does out on the road ain't no business of mine. Ain't that right, Mr. Lawyer? Well, I... Technically, I suppose the holdup is a territorial offence. - You mean I'm right? -Yes, Marshal, you're right. I knew it! I knew we was going to be friends the minute I stepped in here! Now, you folks all know that, well, the jail's only got one cell, and the lock's broke, and I sleep in it. I dang well should've known nothing would happen when you came in here. Now, go on! Get out of here, you big old fat water buffalo! - Get out of here! We got work to do! -Hallie, I ain't ate yet. You know what, I could sure use a snack. Six or seven of those hen's egg, and maybe a side order of bacon. And, hey, is that flapjack batter you're mixing? On the cuff. Sit down. - Papa, go put your pants on. -Oh, yeah. Well, go on! Get out of the way! Sit down! Hallie? You know, you look mighty pretty when you get mad. Like I say, pilgrim, you can eat here till you get back on your feet. May I have your name? Doniphon. Tom Doniphon. You can forget what I said about buying a gun. You're a tenderfoot. Liberty Valance's the toughest man south of the Picketwire. Next to me. - Mr. Peabody! -Evening, Marshal. Did you know that Liberty Valance is in town tonight? I'd be a poor newspaperman indeed if I didn't know what everybody else knows. Well, I don't know what to do about it, Mr. Peabody. - I swear I don't. -Well, do what you're paid to do! - Run him out of town! -Run him out town? Liberty... Me? - My advice to you as... -Coroner. - And your personal... -Physician. Is to get your supper and go to bed. No charge. Sound advice, Marshal, sound advice. Hallie, my love! Hallie, where are you? I await you, my dear. Good evening, now. Well, Saturday night, Mr. Peabody. Better get your order in early before those drunks come in howling from across the street. Hallie! Please. The proprieties concerning the cutlery. Now, how many times have I told you the fork goes to the left of the plate, -and the knife goes... -What's the matter with you? You superstitious or something? Well, what are you going to have to eat? The usual. Steak, beans, potatoes, and deep-dish apple pie. - More black-eyes, Hallie. -All right, Kaintuck! Three steaks, burn them black for the Lazy J boys. Heavy on the beans. Usual for Mr. Peabody, with fixings. Steak, -beans, potatoes... -And deep-dish apple pie. Someday he'll order something different, and we'll all faint dead away. Goodness, Ranse, aren't you finished yet? Here. No wonder, if you don't keep your mind on it. Let me help you. Hallie, I found it. Here, I'll show you. No, my hands are too wet. No, you get the book. Come on, take the book a minute. Nora? Peter? Come here. I want you to hear this. Get the book. Now, that place right here where it says, "Under the law of this territory..." Hallie, you read it out loud. I've got Liberty Valance just exactly where I want him. Just exactly where I want him. What's the matter? Go ahead. Read it. I can't. What? You... Well, why not? Well, I never had the schooling, that's why not. Well... You mean you can't read at all? No. I can't read, and I can't write! Here! Take your book! Nora, for heaven's sakes! Is Mr. Peabody's order ready yet? Coming up. - Hallie, I... -Not enough beans on it. Hallie, I'm sorry. Hallie... I could teach you. What for? What good has reading and writing done you? Look at you! In an apron! Be right with you, boy. I guess I do look kind of funny in this thing. - I didn't mean to hurt her. -She get over it. Besides, what is reading and writing for a girl? She make a wonderful wife, Hallie, for the man she marries. Yeah. And if Tom Doniphon is smart, he pops the question to Hallie before some busybody I'm married to upsets his bag of apples. Oh, you! You go sit down and eat your supper before come the drunks. - But I'm not finished here. -Go sit down! Eat! Well! What you cooking? Steak and potatoes? I'm hungry. I wonder if I could impose upon your hospitality. Just a couple of those steaks, and no beans. Hey, Marshal! Now, you're just the man I'm looking for. Not so loud. Double on the potatoes. One steak for one marshal, on the cuff. Marshal, I was wrong the other day. But I've been reading up on territorial law and there it is right there. Now, I'll draw up the complaint, take care of all the legal details. But you do have jurisdiction. Says so right there. So the next time he sets foot in this town, you arrest him. Anything you say, Mr. Stoddard. I'll be tickled to death to... What was that? Arrest who? Liberty Valance. Arrest Liberty... You mean Liberty Valance? Just when I was starting to get my appetite back. Right, right. Four steaks for the Brophy boys, with black-eyed peas. Burn them. - They're sober tonight, too. -Burn four! Here's the supper for Ranse. - Thank you, Hallie. -Sit down! The way you pop up every time a girl speaks to you. I'm sorry, Hallie, you sort of get in the habit. Ranse, do you think I could? I mean, grown up and all, do you think I could learn to read? Why, sure, you can, Hallie! Why, there's nothing to it. It'd be easy! "Can you learn how to read?" I can teach you. A smart girl like you? Of course you can learn how to read. Now, do you want to try? It's awful worrisome not knowing how. I know the good book from preacher talk, but it'd be a soul comfort if I could read the words myself. Hallie, I'll teach you how to... In no time, you'll be reading everything. Well... Hallie, can I have just one more steak? One steak, on the cuff! All right, all right. Excuse me. - Nora, did you hear the news? -No. Ranse is going to learn me to read and write. "Teach me" to read and write. Teach me to read and write. I cannot say my A-B-C's in Swedish. Maybe you can teach me in English. Why, sure, Nora! You can be my second pupil. Hallie'll be my first pupil, you'll be my second pupil. Peter, you hear that? Peter! Well, pilgrim, I see you're still protecting the ladies. Why, Tom, look at you. You're all dressed up. - Well, it was Saturday night. -My, don't you look handsome. Hallie, I brought you a little present. - Tom! -Prettiest cactus rose I ever did see. My, it is a beauty! Look at it, y'all! Should look nice in your garden. But it should go in the ground right now... Let me plant this for you, Miss Hallie. I'll be pleased to. Thank you, Pompey. The Hashknife group just arrived. Burn eight. Not too close to the acatea bush, Pompey. Yes, ma'am. "Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law." You're a persistent cuss, pilgrim. You really aim to hang that up outside somewhere? That's why I painted it. Well, take some advice, pilgrim. You put that thing up, you'll have to defend it with a gun. And you ain't exactly the type. Coming up. Well, thank you. Girl needs six hands on Saturday night, and it's so hot. Look at my face. Any more colour, and you'd be prettier than that cactus rose. Why, Tom, that's mighty flattering. Burn me a good thick one, Pete. Meat and potatoes. - Hello, Kaintuck. -Evening, Tom. - Tom. -Tom. - Tom. -Object to company, Mr. Peabody? Not to yours, Tom. Sit down, sit down. I suppose you know who's across the street. Yeah. Hear he sent word on ahead. He isn't going to like what the town's been saying about him and that holdup. How about you, Kaintuck? - I'd like a... -Steak? - Yes, ma'am. -Well burnt. - Yeah, and some deep... -Deep-dish apple pie. - Yeah. -Right. Coming up. Mighty nice girl, that Hallie. Mighty pretty. I agree with you, sir. - Just told her so. -What? Do I hear wedding bells? When can I print the story? Don't rush me, Mr. Editor. Don't rush me. There's your cactus rose, Miss Hallie. It sure is pretty. Thank you, Pompey. It is pretty. - Now, you go on in and get your supper. -Thank you, ma'am. Ranse! Look at that. Isn't that the prettiest thing you ever did see? Yeah, it's very pretty. Hallie, did you ever see a real rose? No. But maybe someday. If they ever dam the river, we'll have lots of water. - And all kinds of flowers. -Hallie! Ranse, when you finish the dishes, -will you help Hallie wait on tables? -Sure. Papa, washing dishes is enough for him. Whoever heard of a man waiting on tables? Well, no, that's all right. I'd be glad to help. Be glad to. I thought we was busy. Be right there! Well, these steaks look done just right for us. You cowhands ain't in no hurry to eat, are you? Well, are you? I guess we could do with another drink. Well, now, that's right neighborly of you, partner. Specially after all the lying things I hear folks been saying about Liberty Valance. Wait a minute! One of mama's pies for Tom. Well... Lookie at the new waitress. That's my steak, Valance. Well, you heard him, dude. Pick it up. - No... -Pilgrim, hold it. I said you, Valance. You pick it up. Three against one, Doniphon. My boy Pompey, kitchen door. I'll get it, Liberty. I said you, Liberty. You pick it up. What's the matter? Everybody in this country kill-crazy? Here! There! There! Now! It's picked up! Why don't you get yourself a fresh steak on me? Show's over for now. Try it, Liberty. Just try it. Well, get out! Now, I wonder what scared him off. You know what scared him? The spectacle of law and order here rising up out of the gravy and the mashed potatoes. All right, all right, you made your point. It was the gun that scared him off. Pompey's gun, your gun, Tom. What right did you have to interfere? It was me he tripped. My steak. And you would've killed him for it! Or he would've killed you. Over one measly steak! That's why I picked it up! Well, thanks for saving my life, pilgrim. That isn't Why I did it! Nobody fights my battles! Ranse, I'm sorry. Peter, I'm not in the habit of eating my steak off the floor. Well, cool off, pilgrim. It's all over. Nobody got hurt. It is not all over, and everybody here knows it. He'll be back. He sure will, but not after me. After you, pilgrim. You can't shoot back with a law book, Mr. Stoddard. What Mr. Peabody's trying to say is that if you want to stay healthy, there's two ways to do it. Either I buy a gun or get out of the territory. - Is that what he meant? -That's it, pilgrim. - Yeah, by golly, I... -Peter. Personally, I'd hate to see you go. You're news, Mr. Stoddard. And you've been news ever since you hit this town. "Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law." I didn't mean to hurt your feelings out there. Hey, I'll tell you what. You decide to stick around, and I'll let you hang this thing outside the newspaper office rent-free for as long as it lasts. No. No. The first time Liberty Valance rides into town, he'll shoot it to pieces, and the whole newspaper office with it. How about that, Mr. Peabody? Well, that'd be news. I accept your offer, Mr. Peabody. How about letting me hang up that shingle tomorrow? Tomorrow? - Well, of course. -Thank you. Why not? I'm staying, and I'm not buying a gun, either. Well, good luck, pilgrim. Hallie, I'll be out of town for a while, north of the Picketwire, horse-trading. Goodbye, Tom. And take note of what goes on around town, 'cause by the time I get back, there won't be no newspaper to read it in. Well! Any news? Hansons had a baby boy, eight pounds. - Not twins? -Not twins, no. Here. I got this list of voters for you. There are 37 new registrations over last year, and not one single one of them in need of a lawyer. Thirty-seven, huh? Well, by golly, now if we can only get those voters out to vote, maybe we can handle those cattle barons from across the Picketwire. Did you write this, Mr. Peabody? Yeah. Well, this is great! You like it? This is just great! Well, as my old boss, Horace Greeley, used to say, "We'll tear their hearts out." I'll be right there. - Let me have this. I'll use it in class. -Well! Morning! Morning. I'm sorry I'm late. There's one thing a teacher should never be, and that's late for class. Now, you can take your seats. Well, this is quite a turnout this morning. It seems like we have more new pupils every day. - Morning, Marshal. -Morning, Ranse. - How you feeling this morning? -Just fine. Fine. Fine. - Your head cold? - Oh, no. I am... Excuse me. I just wanted to see how Julietta was doing. Julietta's just doing fine, Marshal. Gracias, señor. How's the rest of my little family doing, reading in English? Well, Hallie here, she's in charge of the kindergarten. Hallie, why don't you take a run through the A-B-C's for the marshal? All right, you ready? One, two, three... ♪ A, B, C, D, E, F, G ♪ ♪ H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P ♪ ♪ Q, R, S and T, U, V ♪ ♪ W, X and Y and Z ♪ ♪ Now I know my A-B-C's ♪ ♪ Tell me what you think of me ♪ Well, that's just fine, just fine. Well, now, I see a couple more new pupils back there. Highpockets, Kaintuck, now, what, you fellas really serious about reading and writing? Go on. Stand up. Tell him! Well, Miss... Miss Hallie, she talked such a right smart argument to the Lazy J... to the boss of the Lazy J, well, he just up and told all the hands to... cut the cards to see who comes to school, - and I lost. - I see. Well, we'll try to... - Good morning, Mr. Carruthers. -Good morning. Caught him playing hooky again down by the Picketwire, fishing! Catch anything, Herbert? - No, sir. They weren't biting. - Well, that's too bad. - Ain't you going to give him a whopping? - No. He's too big. Now, for the benefit of those who are just starting... None of us in here smoke, Mr. Carruthers. Thank you. For those of you who have just started, I might explain to you that we've begun the school... by studying about our country... and how it's governed. Now, let's see. Well, Nora, would you tell the class what you've learned about the United States? The United States is a republic, and a republic is a state in which the people are the boss. That means us. And if the big shots in Washington don't do like we want, we don't vote for them, by golly, no more! -"Anymore." -Anymore! That's fine, Nora. That's just fine. Now, I wonder if anybody in class remembers what the basic law of the land is called. Now, you remember I told you that it had to be added to and changed from time to time by things called amendments. Now, does anybody remember? Julietta, your hand's always up. Here. Let's... Pompey, you try this one. It was writ by Mr. Thomas Jefferson of Virginia. -"Was written", Pompey. -Written by Mr. Thomas Jefferson, -and he called it the Constitution. -Declaration of Independence. It begun with the words, "We hold these truths -"to be..." -"Self-evident." - Let him alone, Charlie. -"...self-evident that..." "That all men are created equal." That's fine, Pompey. I knew that, Mr. Ranse, but I just plumb forgot it. That's all right, Pompey, a lot of people forget that part of it. You did just fine, Pompey. Thank you, Mr. Ranse. Now, this law of the land also states that the governing power rests with the electorate. The electorate. Now, that means you. That means the people, and you exercise this power through the vote. Now then... Yeah? Well... Hallie? Go right ahead. Hallie, would you... Now, I have here what I think the best textbook in the world is, an honest newspaper. This is the Shinbone Star, Dutton Peabody, Editor-in-Chief. And reading this ought to bring home to everybody south of the Picketwire the importance of using that vote. Now, the headlines say, "Cattlemen fight statehood. Small homesteaders in danger." Makes it very clear that, if the big ranchers north of the Picketwire River, if they win their fight to keep this territory an open range, then all your truck farms and your corn, the small shopkeepers and everything, the future of your kids, it'll all be all over, be gone. And they call upon you in this article, they call upon you to unite behind a real strong delegate and carry this fight to Washington, if necessary. Hello, Tom! Welcome back! Here, you want to join us? I'm looking for Pompey. I've been away three weeks, and there's no sashes or doors in yet. What have you been wasting your time around here for? Get on back to work. Your schooling's over. Now listen, there isn't any sense in you getting rough with Pompey. - He's entitled to a seat... -What I got to say to you, Stoddard, will be a whole lot rougher. The good editor here has written some noble words, and you read them good. Too good. But if you put that paper out, the streets of Shinbone are going to be running with blood. Why are you against this, Tom? You of all people. I don't know, I've been under the impression there are more votes south of the Picketwire... - than north. - That's right, but votes won't stand up against guns. Guns? What guns, Tom? Oh, Appleyard, do you think Valance stays away from here 'cause he's scared of you? He's out recruiting hired guns for the big ranchers. - Julietta? - Sí, papacita. You better take the little ones home. - Andale. - Come on, andale. - Andale. - Come on. Hallie, I think it'd be a good idea if you dismissed the whole class. - Dismiss the class? Ranse... -No. Go on. Go on. Dismiss. Please. Class dismissed! - Same time tomorrow! - You get on over to the store. Tom, this could get worse than the sheep wars. You don't suppose they'll start anything down here, do you? It's already started. Valance and his men crossed the river yesterday, killed a couple of sodbusters, old man Holliday and his son. - You know that for a fact, Tom? -I do. They tried to bushwhack me, unfortunately for one of them. You're going to put that in your newspaper, too? Well, it's news, and I'm a newspaperman. Print that, and he'll kill you, sure as hell. You think they'll come here, Tom? They'll be here, all right, tomorrow or the next clay, according to how much who-hit-john they consume, but election day, pilgrim, you can depend on it. They'll be here. Hallie, go on back where you belong. I don't want you going to school in no shooting gallery. Now you listen to me, Tom Doniphon. What I do and where I go is none of your business. You don't own me! Like I said, Hallie, you're awful pretty when you get mad. Ranse, after all you've taught us, how can you say we should knuckle under now? You heard what Tom said. When force threatens, talk's no good any more! Hallie... Hallie, go find Tom and make it up to him. He... He's only trying to protect you. Ranse. Ranse! Better let him go, Hallie. Why? Where's he going? Well, he's going to need all the practice he can get. Practice? What are you talking about? I might as well let you know now. That day he decided to come in with me, I let him have an old gun of mine. He's been going out in the country twice a week practicing ever since. You mean he's going to face up to Liberty? Liberty Valance? - Ranse? -That's the only way I can figure it. He never would discuss it with me. He just keeps on... Practicing. Tom! Tom Doniphon! Hey, Professor! Where are you going? - I want to talk to you, over at my place. -But, Tom, I'm going... Step down, pilgrim. Take a look. Well, all right, Tom. What are you trying to tell me? I'm telling you that Hallie's my girl. I'm building that brand-new room and porch for her for when we get married. Well, Tom, I guess everybody pretty much takes that for granted. Everybody except Hallie. Maybe you. Now, that's a damn lie, and you know it. Well, then why did she come to me back there, fretting herself sick because you were going to get yourself killed facing up to Liberty Valance? - I never told her that! -Well, Peabody did! I think you're bluffing. I'm not bluffing about anything! Wait a minute, Tom. What... Pompey, bring two or three of those paint cans. You're carrying a gun, ain't you? - Yes, I have a gun. -Get it. Come on. All right, gunslinger. Hit that can. Pretty far. Pilgrim. - You've got to cock it first. -I forgot. Balance it light in your hand, and don't jerk the trigger... - Squeeze. - All right, all right. You don't have to coach me. Pompey, bring me those cans. Give me that thing. I'll show you how easy it is. Take these cans, put them on those three posts. Go ahead. That's it, that first post. - There? -That's right. Not there! On the far post. That's right! Now put that last one in the middle! Pilgrim! I hate tricks, pilgrim, but that's what you're up against with Valance. He's almost as fast as I am. I don't like tricks myself, so that makes us even! Hey. pilgrim! You forgot your pop gun. I got you, Lize. Rufe McMars. Highpockets. Kaintuck. Kaintuck! Leave the jug. Hallie, I am so proud. Dutton Peabody, exercising his franchise. -"Dutton Peabody." -Ransom Stoddard. Oh, Ranse, we'll be needing you for some of that legal stuff that'll be coming up later. "Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law." Check. Peter Ericson, American citizen. Go on in, Pete. - See you for supper, Pete? -Yeah. - Hey, Tom! Tom! -Yes, Doc. - What we need is statehood! -I agree with you, Doc. - Herbert? - Yes, sir? You're too young to vote. Back to school. Greetings. Hey, excuse me. Now! I'll have the usual, Jack. Bar's closed. The bar is closed, Mr. Editor, during voting. You can blame your lawyer friend. He says that's one of the fundamental laws of democracy, and no exception. No exceptions for the working press? That's carrying democracy much too far. - A small beer. -The bar is closed. Give me that bung starter, Jack. - Tom! -Tom... All right! Settle down! Sit down, everybody! Come on, settle down. Settle down! Well, since our legal authority closed the bar on us, I propose that Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law, come up here and run this meeting for us. - I second the motion! -And I third it! There he is. There he is! There's your persuader, pilgrim! All right. All right, now, if that's what you all want, I can show you the rules. The meeting will come to order! Let's settle down, please, huh? Mr. Peabody, would you like to keep a record of the meeting? Now, Ranse, please. There are other men that... - Give me a drink, will you? Just... -Bar's closed. Just a beer! - The bar's closed. -A beer's not drinking! - Before we get started, I'd like to... -Would you sit down, Doctor, please? Do you have a pencil? Yes, yes, I have it. I have a pencil right here. Thank you. Now, you all know why we're here. We're here to elect two delegates, because the growing population south of the Picketwire entitles us to two. Now, these two delegates will represent us in the territorial convention for statehood. - Yeah! -Hear, hear! You know the issue. The cattle interests want to keep this territory an open range... No! Ruled by their highhanded ideas, whatever they are. And we, that means everybody in this room, we're for statehood! Yeah! We want statehood because statehood means the protection of our farms and our fences, and it means schools for our children, and it means progress for the future! Yeah! - Could I take the floor a moment? -Now, just sit down! Please. Now, we'll proceed with the nominations. Now, remember, you can nominate as many as you feel like. And in order to show you how this procedure works, I'm going to step out of the chair for a minute. That's parliamentary law. You can do that. I'll step out of the chair and I'll make my... Make the first nomination. I'd like to nominate a man who, I think, is the only man in Shinbone who has the right qualifications to lead us in our fight for statehood. Now, I could stand up here and talk about this fellow all clay, but I know that everybody in this room could do the same thing, and I don't think that's necessary. I nominate Tom Doniphon! Yeah! Come on! Sit down! Sit down! Stop sucking on that cigar and put that pencil away, 'cause I refuse the nomination. Tom, you can't refuse now, you've already been nominated. Yes, I can, 'cause I got other plans. Personal plans. Mr. Attorney, go on with your meeting. You don't come from south of the Picketwire, Valance. You got no vote here. I live where I hang my hat. Come on, move! Out of the way! Get out! Well, hashslinger? What are you standing there looking high and mighty about? He's running this here meeting. Or hadn't you heard? The whole shebang. I'd like to nominate the chairman, Mr. Ransom Stoddard, as delegate to the territorial convention. Wait a minute here, now. And I second that nomination. Not only because he knows the law, but because he throws a good punch. Now, listen, all you sodbusters, you hard-rock farmers! I aim to be the delegate from south of the Picketwire! - Valance, you don't live south... -Floyd! Say your piece, like I told you. I nominate Liberty Valance for delegate! I second the nomination. Move the nomination to be closed! Now, wait a minute. That ain't exactly legal, -is it, Mr. Attorney? -No. We need two good delegates to Capitol City, Valance, two honest men. We've got one in you, Mr. Stoddard. You looking for trouble, Doniphon? You aim to help me find some? You heard my motion, dude! All right. Put his name down. "Liberty Valance, address unknown." Have I got a right to speak in this place? Go ahead, Highpockets. Then what about Mr. Peabody? He can read and write, and he runs the newspaper. Yeah, and when he's drinking, why, he can talk the ears off a wooden Indian. I second the motion! No! No! I... No, you don't! No! I'm a newspaper man, not a politician! No. Politicians are my meat! I build them up! I tear them down! But I wouldn't be one. I couldn't be one! It'd destroy me! - Give me a... -Bar's closed. Good people of Shinbone, I... I'm your conscience, I'm the still, small voice that thunders in the night. I'm your watchdog that howls against the wolves! I'm... I'm your father confessor! I'm... - What else am I? -Town drunk? "Dutton Peabody." Write it down. - I move the nominations be closed. -I second the motion! All in favor, say, "Aye." Aye! All right, now we'll proceed with the election. You sodbusters are a brave bunch when you're together, but don't vote any way now that you'll regret later when you're alone. All those in favor of Ransom Stoddard as delegate, raise your hands. Aye! All those in favor of Liberty Valance, raise your hands. All those in favor of Dutton Peabody, raise your hands! - Aye! -Let's all have a drink. - Give me a drink! -The bar's closed! According to Mr. Stoddard, the bar is closed. Anything further on the election? No, legally, the election's finished. Then the bar is open! Give me a drink! That vote don't mean a thing. Now, you stay out of this, Doniphon. He's been hiding behind your gun long enough. You got a choice, dishwasher. Either you get out of town, or tonight, you be out in that street alone. You be there, and don't make us come and get you. Well, he called it plain. Too bad you didn't come to me sooner with that gun. Pilgrim, come full dark, Pompey'll be back at the Swedes' place with a buckboard. Why don't you get out of town? Thanks. "Liberty Valance defeated"! "D-E-F-E..." "...E-T-E-D"? The unsteady hand betrays, huh? What's the matter, Mr. Peabody? Are you afraid? The answer is indubitably... Yes. No courage left. Well, courage can be purchased at yon tavern. But have we credit? That is the question. Have we credit? Well, credit is cheap. Wait for me, old servant of the public weal. Our shining hour is yet to come! As for you, Horace Greeley, "Go West, old man, and grow young with the country." Don't do that, Mr. Peabody. What are you doing out here? Don't you know that everybody is supposed to get off the street? My inalienable right, the pursuit of happiness. Sure, sure, but don't go down to the saloon. Liberty Valance is back there. You should hear what he's swearing to do to Ranse Stoddard. And he ain't leaving you out, either. Now, go on in there and let the Mexican fill that up. But I doubt if my credit is good with the Spanish-American gentleman. Sure it is. He's my wife's step-uncle by her sister's marriage. Would you say something nice about me in your paper? My dear friend, Link Appleyard? The fearless, fighting marshal of the west? Your name will go down in history with Buffalo Bill! Mr. Peabody's drunker than a skunk over in that Mexican joint. He ain't eating tonight. Hallie, he "isn't" eating tonight. Remember? Isn't, ain't. What difference does it make? Ain't going to be no school any more, anyway, with you leaving tonight. Good evening, folks. Mr. Ranse, I have the buckboard out here like Mr. Tom told me. I'll be waiting for you if you need me. Go, Ranse. Go now while you can. Nora and Hallie can finish the dishes. Ja, Ranse, go. Please go. I owe you for three days' room and board. I... I just want to square my account. I want to square my account before I go. "And those in England now asleep "Shall think themselves accursed "they were not here, "whilst any lives, That fought with us "on St. Crispin's Day?" "But when the blast, the blast of war, blows in our ears, "Then we summon up..." Liberty Valance and his Myrmidons! Liberty Valance taking liberties with the liberty of the press? Had your supper yet, Peabody? My supper? No! That's a splendid idea! I'll... Well, you can start by eating this. - It's a poor joke, Liberty! -Eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Eat it! He's dead! Mr. Peabody. Ranse? Ranse Stoddard? - Mr. Peabody? -Help me get him up there. - Where's Doc Willoughby? -He's still in the saloon. Go get him. Ranse? Ranse! I sure told that Liberty Valance about the freedom of the press. Marshal? Marshal, you tell Liberty Valance I'll be outside. - Pompey! -Miss Hallie? - Pompey, where's Mr. Tom? -Down the road a piece, playing... Get him quick! Ranse is out front with a gun. - Hurry! -Yes, ma'am! Gettysburg. You've heard of Gettysburg. -240 amputations in one... -Doc? Mr- Peabody's awful hurt, and he needs you bad over at his office. What's the matter, Mr. Marshal? Somebody have an accident? So that's it. Another one of your accidents, huh, Valance? I'm looking forward to the clay when it's you they'll be calling me for. Paid in advance. Ten dollars into the kitty. Liberty, what you did to Mr. Peabody, ain't that enough? "Ain't that enough" what, Mr. Marshal? You all know that Ranse Stoddard couldn't shoot the hat off his own head with a gun right in his hand. You mean he's got a gun in his hand, huh? I'm calling you, Valance! Kings and treys. Good hand. But not good enough. Aces and eights. Thank you. If you gun him down, it'll just be pure murder. Well, Mr. Professor, I thought you left town. What are you doing out here? I'm waiting for Liberty Valance. Why doesn't he come out? Well, that's none of our business. You all heard him say he had a gun in his hand, didn't you? - I didn't say that! -That ain't murder, Mr. Marshal. That's a clean-cut case of self-defense. You heard him call me out, didn't you, tinhorn? Well, didn't you? Now, get out of my way. Hashslinger, are you out here? I'd say that was Liberty Valance there now, wouldn't you? - Yes, I would. -We'll be seeing you, Mr. Stoddard! Come closer where I can see you. Get out of that shadow, dude. You got two hands, hashslinger. Pick it up. All right, dude. This time, right between the eyes. Liberty? Liberty? Liberty! Hey, Doc? Doc? Liberty! It's Liberty! He's hurt! It's Liberty. Whiskey, quick! Here, sir. Dead. Ranse, if it had been you instead of Valance, I... No, Hallie. Hallie. I can't help it. I feel so guilty. I didn't want you to run away. I wanted you to stay. He might... I'm sorry. - Forgive me. -Hallie, please. Sorry I got here too late, Hallie. But you got yourself out of that fix real handy. I'll be around. - Tom! Liberty... -I know. You all saw it. Liberty wasn't going to kill him, just nick him a little. He was just going to make him dance, have some fun with him. You saw that! That lawyer fellow shot him down in cold blood! - Well, now, that ain't the way we saw it. -It was murder, pure murder! And I say if the marshal don't put Stoddard in jail, we ought to take care of him ourselves! - I say we ought to hang him! -That's right! Hang him! Give him a rope necktie and let him swing! Can't a man get a drink around this town in peace? - No one's bothering you, Doniphon. -You are! Marshal! What are you getting paid for? Drag this scum out of here. You heard him! Now, Kaintuck and Highpockets, I deputize you to give a hand. Drag this scum out of here! Hand me that... That's it. You tell those ranchers north of the Picketwire that hired you that me, Link Appleyard, run you out of town! And I'll do it again if you ever come back! - Now look, Pompey, you know I... -Who says he can't? Pour yourself a drink, Pompey. You know I don't drink no drams, Mr. Tom. - I said take a drink! -No, sir. We got a mare in foal and horses to feed and water. Come on home. Home. Home, sweet home. You're right, Pompey. We got plenty to do at home. Well, what are they paying you guys for? Play! Be merry! Sing! Mr. Tom! The horses, Pompey. The horses. Put those bags right in the corner over there. Hello, how are you? - Hey, Dutton Peabody. -Handy Strong. By golly, you made it, and on your own three legs. Yeah, thanks to Doc Willoughby. Here. Let me pin one of these on you. - Thank you. -Say, that's him, huh? Well, this must be Ransom Stoddard. Ranse, this is Handy Strong. How do you do, sir? This is quite a city you have here, Mr. Strong. Well, it's not much according to your Eastern standards, but that railroad station there leads straight to Washington. Come on, Ranse. Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Quiet! The roll call having been completed and the delegates recognized and seated, this session of the territorial convention is hereby declared open! Order! Order! Mr. Chairman! The chair recognizes the Honorable Major Cassius Starbuckle, soldier, jurist, and statesman. Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen, I came here with a carefully prepared speech, but this is no time for oratory. Let me speak to you from the heart. I come before you to place in nomination the name of a man more qualified than any other to represent you in Washington. O you ill-advised, O you poorly counseled, fly not in the face of heaven's handiwork. Join with us in supporting the man who, for five terms in Congress, has kept this great territory inviolate. I nominate for the territorial delegate to the Congress of the United States the Right Honorable Custis "Buck" Langhorne. Order! Order! Now that you got your rope on him, hang the horse thief! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! This is a convention, not a rodeo, Langhorne! Mr. Chairman! The chair recognizes its old friend, that distinguished member of the fourth estate, founder, owner, publisher, and editor of the Shinbone Star, Mr. Dutton Peabody, Esquire! Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for those kind words. But why don't you tell them the whole truth? Founder, owner, editor, and I also sweep out the place. Fellow delegates, like all of you, I have listened in awe and admiration to the magnificent oratory of the Honorable Major Cassius Starbuckle, the cattlemen's mouthpiece. The lowing herd is still with us. But seriously, under the spell of his eloquence, I could see once again the vast herd of buffalo and savage redskin roaming our beautiful territory with no law to trammel them except the law of survival, the law of the tomahawk and the bow and arrow. And then, with the westward march of our nation came the pioneer and the buffalo hunter, the adventurous and the bold. And the boldest of these were the cattlemen who seized the wide-open range for their own personal domain, and their law was the law of the hired gun! But now, now today, have come the railroads, and the people, the steady, hardworking citizens, the homesteader, the shopkeeper, the builder of cities. We need roads to join those cities, dams to store up the waters of the Picketwire, and we need statehood to protect the rights of every man and woman, however humble. And how do we get it? I'll tell you how! We get it by placing our votes behind one man. One man! And we have that man with us here. He is a man who came to us, not packing a gun, but carrying instead a bag of law books. Yes, he is a lawyer, and a teacher. The first west of the Rosy Buttes. But more important, he is a man who has come to be known throughout this territory in the last few weeks as a great champion of law and order! Ladies and gentlemen, I nominate as your delegate and mine to the Congress at Washington, the Honorable Ransom Stoddard! Order! Get going, Starbuckle! Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Well, I see this demonstration, but I can't believe my eyes. Is it possible that such a representative body of honest, hard-working Americans can endorse a candidate for the Congress of our beloved country whose only claim to the office is that he killed a man? Do you call Liberty Valance a man? Order! Order! Hear me out! Who is this Ransom Stoddard? And what qualifications has he that entitle him to aspire to such great office? We are told he's a lawyer. An attorney at law. An officer of the court. Yes, but what kind of lawyer? A man who usurps the function of both judge and jury and takes the law into his own hands! He did not! - Let's have order! Quiet! Silence! -Mr. Chairman... Quiet! What other qualifications has he, then? The blood on his hands? The hidden gun beneath his coat? The bullet-riddled body of an honest citizen? - Honest citizen? -Liberty Valance? You call Liberty Valance an honest citizen? Is this your fearless champion of law and order? - Mr. Chairman... -I tell you, the mark of Cain is on this man! And the mark of Cain will be on all of us if we send him with blood-stained hands to walk the hallowed halls of government where Washington, Jefferson... - Mr. Chairman, please! -Silence, sir! - Mr. Chairman! -Silence! Yes, and Lincoln still live, immortals in the memory of man. - Mr. Chairman! -Mr. Chairman! Ranse! Ranse! Pilgrim! Where are you going? I'm going home, Tom. I'm going back east, where I belong. Valance couldn't make you run away. What is it now, pilgrim? Your conscience? Isn't it enough to kill a man with... Without trying to build a life on it? You talk too much. Think too much. Besides, you didn't kill Liberty Valance. - What? -Think back, pilgrim. Valance came out of the saloon, you were walking toward him when he fired his first shot. Remember? Pompey- All right, dude. This time, right between the eyes. But, Tom, why did you do it? Why... Cold-blooded murder. But I can live with it. Hallie's happy. She wanted you alive. But you saved my life! I wish I hadn't. Hallie's your girl now. Go on back in there and take that nomination. You taught her how to read and write. Now give her something to read and write about! - Ranse! -He's back! Well, you know the rest of it. I went to Washington, we won statehood, and I became the first governor. Three terms as governor, two terms in the Senate, ambassador to the Court of St. James, back again to the Senate, and a man who, with the snap of his fingers, could be the next vice president of the United States. Well, you're not going to use the story, Mr. Scott? No, sir. This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend. He's right, Ranse. It's getting late, Hallie. We'll keep in touch with you, Pompey. I promise. - But Mr. Ranse... -It's pork chop money. Hallie... Hallie, would you be too sorry if, once I get the new irrigation bill through... Would you be too sorry if we just up and left Washington? I... I sort of have a hankering to come back here to live, maybe open up a law office. Ranse. If you knew how often I dreamed of it. My roots are here. I guess my heart is here. Yes, let's come back. Look at it. It was once a wilderness. Now, it's a garden. Aren't you proud? Hallie, who put the cactus roses on Tom's coffin? I did. Here, got a brand-new spittoon for you. "Cuspidor," Hallie. And Luke, the engineer's got a full head of steam in this old tar bucket. We're going to make 25 miles an hour or bust a boiler trying. And we wired ahead to Junction City. They're going to hold the express for you. Ranse, in two days and two nights, you're going to be right back in Washington. Thank you, Jason. Thank you. And I'm going to write a letter to the officials of this railroad and thank them for their kindness and for going to all this trouble. You think nothing of it. Nothing's too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance. -- English --
