Danger is my middle name. Why do we always come here? - The coffee is shit. - For the cozy atmosphere. - You know where they make good coffee? - In Naples. You drank a coffee there on May 31, 1984, during the Cheyenne "Bad Friends" tour. "Bad Friends" with Cheyenne and Fellows' Sixth album. If this crisis drags on, you can write my official biography. I'll be sure to write that when you went for a swim at Posillipo, someone stole your clothes and shoes. Naples is a violent place. Violence is everywhere. Except it doesn't always show. - Hello. - Hello. - I'm Cheyenne. - I know. I, on the other hand, would be Desmond. - This would be Desmond. - Mary. Excuse me for being too direct, Mary, but ehm... I was wondering if it's okay with your father here and... - maybe we could go out sometime. - He's not my father. Oh! I think that the idea of the two of you... going out together is... nice, alright? What sort of music do you listen to? Emmm! I... Emmm... Mariah Carey. Thank you for your invitation Desmond, but I'm afraid I'm busy for the next 14 years. ♪ Open up your door and let me in ♪ ♪ Cause you know it's over... ♪ Something's wrong here. I don't know exactly what it is... ... but, something. Hey Chey? Hey, how you doin'? Tesco's shot up. If I sell now, we'll make 30,000 euros. You know, I don't think this stock exchange is doing you much good. Really? - What's for supper? - Pizza. - Veggie pizza. - You're full of surprises. It's one of the reasons I fell in love with you. Don't overdo it on the pizza, or you'll lose. I never lose. - Is that so? - Sometimes I let you win. Oh, really? And why would you do that? It makes you feel like a stud ! It's... game to me: 21-12. Because of my fuckin' sciatica. Oh that's shite! I told you, sometimes I let you win. Did you really mean that? - Any news of Tony? - Not a word. Did you open that letter, from MTV? Can you pass the cream, please? Aren't you even curious to know what it said? Only up to a point. Oh my God, look, when you see these big black ones you've gotta tell me. This is really gross. MTV has worldwide coverage, you know that? It's broadcast live. And this year as their very special guest, After 20 years out of the spotlight they would like to have... Cheyenne and the Fellows. Why is Lady Gaga...? Don't you even wanna think about it? I already did think about it 20 years ago. I'm still busy. I'm gonna wait for you in bed. Naked. - Who are you? - The future. - May I speak with your husband? - Yeah, sure, right through there. The past awaits you. How'r ye, I'm Steven, we saw each other at the mall. I was singin' "Bonnie Prince Billy", Do you remember? - Uh... I don't remember. - No, of course you don't, because it's a really shitty cover. Oh, shitty cover. I brought a live demo with me and me group. I want you to produce our first album. - I'm not a producer. - You should be. - Well you're rather determined, aren't you? - Rather. What made you think of me? What, you used to let the rhythm guitar predominate over the masturbatin' lead guitar. Nobody did that as well as you and I'm in complete agreement with that approach, In fact I'm in total divergence with our lead guitarist. Yeah, we had that problem. In the end we had to get rid of the guitarist. I can't get rid of the guitarist, man, he's me brother. Listen, if you produce us you could have you say about everything. Except the name of the group that is not negotiable. What do you call yourselves? "The Pieces of Shit". - That's a really good choice. - Fuckin' right it is, yeah. Took us six months to come up with it. Besides, it's exactly the right name for this moment in history. I'll see ya brother. I don't have this one. Fuck, a bootleg copy ! Fuck! Desmond, where did you come across that relic? I ah...ehm - When I... - You gave it to him. What the fuck does that mean? You two arranged the whole thing ahead of time. - Fuckin' morons. - You're fuckin' paranoid. I'm sorry, Mary. I invited Desmond for supper on Friday and you have to come too. Forget it ! Not on your life. Morgan Labs, buy 70, hold 30%. - That bitch Melany dumped me. - How long were you together? - Four days. - Are you suffering? Like the last panda standing. That woman extinguished me. Keep your eye on the Tesco shares. Look A couple of teenage girls standing outside the school. Growing in front of our very eyes. Listen, lemme tell you about that antiques dealer, I shagged on Wednesday. One leg in a cast, mate, it was the most satisfying fuck ever. No, no. I don't think that would interest me. Excuse me. Karen, God bless ya, thanks for calling me back. Yeah, yeah. I feel so lonely. - So how is your life, grandma? - Very good, except for my husband. Take a lover. I have that already, like everything else. And yours? How's yours going ? My life? My life is just... fine. How many times must we tell you you're not welcome at our sons' graves. Ehm Friday... That dinner you mentioned. I'll be there. Did you do the bike? The bike... - Shh ! I was just asking myself... Why, with all the vices I've indulged in my life, I never took up smoking. Where's my son? That's what you should be asking yourself. Everything else is bullshit. - Unfortunately I don't know where he is. - Go find him then. All of you. Three months is an eternity. Why? If everything is just fine, Why would someone just leave... Without saying a word? Without sending news. Why? You never took up smoking, because you remained a child. Children are the only ones that never get the urge to smoke. Tony never smoked either. OK, so I know you're wondering what sorta position you have to use to shag someone whose leg is in a cast up to their crotch. I wasn't wondering that in the least, Jeffrey. You have to use different things, you know, experiment. How do you manage to get all these women? If you think about it, You're not handsome, you're not smart. Instead, you're invasive, and egocentric, and you sweat like a pig. - So what makes you so fuckin' special? - Special? Yeah ! Nothing. But I've got two things that most other men don't have. I've got curiosity, and time. You see, Cheyenne, I dedicate a whole lot of time to women, you know. And in the end, that's what seduces them. I'm beside them all the time. For up to six months straight, if I have to. Every single fuckin' day. Understand? And they don't cave in because they're exhausted, no. They cave in because they didn't believe they were worth all that time. Do you get it? Pretty much. And the curiosity part? The curiosity is the fire that keeps you going for six months straight. You know what my lame legged lover said to me just before I came? She was panting. 'Explode on my cast' She said, 'I want you to sign it for me'. Moments like that, make you feel like a better man, you know. What the fuck are you doing? You like making me talk to myself, do ya? Did I ever tell you about the time that Jane fell asleep watching TV, while smoking a joint? And a pillow on the couch caught on fire, but I realized it in time and managed to put it out? I forgot to tell you a crucial detail, Desmond, that's why you're not laughing. Jane is a firefighter by profession. - So, Desmond, you live alone or what? - Me? No. With my family. Unfortunately. - I have six brothers. - Fuck! Six brothers. Yeah. Six lazy slackers that don't do a damn thing all day. Be a good thing for all of them to vanish from the face of the earth for a while. Excuse me. I need to go to the bathroom. Nice move, Desmond. What did I say wrong? Nothing, women are always running off to the bathroom. You know When you're young, you think it's to snort cocaine, but as years go by you learn there can be many reasons, like food stuck in their teeth, their period... Yeah, take notes Desmond. Jeffrey clearly knows all about us women. Cheyenne, the roast beef looks lovely. Too bad Michelle and I don't eat meat. Michelle is the little doggie. Fuck. Fuck ! How deep is it? At its deepest point? Seven feet. What's wrong with your dog? I don't know. Jane looks after him. - Do you not work, Cheyenne? - I don't have to. Everybody needs to work. - You don't have any kids? - No. - Why not? - Rock stars shouldn't have kids, 'cause you run the risk that your daughter becomes a wacky stylist. Why isn't there any water in your pool? I don't know. No one ever filled it. - What about you doing it? - Well, as a matter of fact... Jane and I play bare hand Pelota in it. And Pelota is more fun than swimming. - So why did you... - Desmond, I didn't invite you to dinner to interview me !.. Sorry. Sorry. ♪ From what I've seen, ♪ ♪ You're magnificent... ♪ I never managed to get it together with Mary. I really fancy her. The secret is time, Desmond. Spend time with her. All the time she needs. Then she'll come around. You'll see. That's what wins women over, and makes them feel safe. Please don't give up on Mary, Desmond. Promise me. ♪ I have a feeling ♪ ♪ From what I do ♪ ♪ That you might lay there and ♪ ♪ Love me too ♪ - Jane? - Hmm? I think I'm a tad depressed. No. I think a man who does that, with his wife of 35 years, like it's for the first time is not depressed. Maybe you're confusing depression and boredom. Hello. Hello? My father is dying of old age: a non-existent disease. And I haven't flown in 30 years. - Fear of flying isn't your only problem. - That's true. I also have a mild fear of dying. You can't die, until you sell off those Tesco shares. - What will you do while I'm away? - Oh, the usual things. Take it easy on the Tai Ch'i. - Jane, can I ask you something? - Sure, honey. What? Why did you let an architect, write "cuisine" on the kitchen wall? It's silly. I know it's the kitchen. Come back to me soon. You know I can't live without you. That's not true, but it's kind of you to say. The problem is, it just doesn't last. Half an hour, it's already worn off. - It's true. - Your lips are plenty glam without it. Stop joking, I'm serious ! Have you tried the ones with bee pollen? They usually last quite a while. No, you need one with hydrating elements like Lancome. Otherwise it's flaking like plaster after an hour. Wise words. Helena Rubinstein is pretty good too... The brand doesn't matter. If you want real staying power, You have to put a thin layer of face powder on your lips first. That's the secret. Then your lipstick will last all day.

I'm just kidding. David, there's something that I have to tell you. Even though we haven't seen each other in all these years, I... Still can't believe you consider me a friend. Why's that? Because we haven't the slightest thing in common. You have such precise thoughts. Ideas that you turn into reality, and... You amaze people with your ideas. And they call you the most extraordinary thing: an artist, and they're right. David Byrne is an artist. Well you did that when you were performing! The fuck I was, David! The fuck I was. I was a fucking pop star. I just wrote dreary songs because they were all the rage and made tons of money. Depressed songs for depressed kids, and two of them, more fragile than the rest, ended up doing themselves in as a result of it. And now I go to a cemetery once a week to appease my guilt, and it doesn't make it better. It makes it fuckin' worse. And then my wife asks me why I don't play anymore, and I think she must be a fool Because then, but then she maybe she just loves me very much, Which makes her more of a fool because she doesn't know what a disaster her husband is. And that's it, David, that's it! Before the inferno, my life could be summed up in a single word, Lightheartedness. To ensure a safe passage, we will join in saying kaddish for Leon Yitgadal ve-yitkadash, Shmei rabbah (May His name be magnified and made holy) Who is that? Do you know who that is? - Everyone knows him. - Not me. - That's Mordechai Midler. - Who is he? A legend. I got it right here. Tell you what, you call me in the next thirty. ... Thirty minutes. We got a deal, alright? Ring's in my pocket. Right, bye ! You enjoyin' yourself, my friend? You wanna look death in the face, you can't go wrong witha tourist trap like this. Ernie Ray, financial broker. Big deals, if you ever need it. Do I look like a person who makes big deals? Hey, money can be found in the most improbable places. - It's experience talking, my friend. - That's your big experience talking, Ernie. You know you're a good guy, you. Tell me, how the fuck old are ya, I can't figure it out. I'm as old as I look under all this face paint and lipstick. You're a good guy, I knew it. You also got yourself a little bit of problems right now. I won't ask what they are 'cause I know you wouldn't tell me. Do you know what my problem is though? No, but I have a feeling, I'm gonna to be hearing about it. So, the boss calls me, an hour ago. Says: "Ernie you gotta catch a plane to London tomorrow. Stay for a month". That's all well and good, except for the fact That I'm in New York City with my pick-up, that I gotta to get back to Texas. Wife needs it, not that I give a shit about that. The real problem is a garage in this city costs a fucking fortune. That my friend... that's my problem. If I recall correctly, there are companies that deal with that sort of thing. Hey, I'm not giving my pickup to some fuckin' company, Wouldn't be able to trust 'em. - Then there's no solution. - That's right. There's no solution. Did you read them? I flipped through them. He didn't talk about me at all. You never say a word about him. You two are exactly the same. How about the sketches did you look at them? - I didn't understand a fucking thing. He drew everything that might be of help in searching for him. In searching for who, Richard? I didn't talk to my father in 30 years. I don't know the first thing about him. After you left for Ireland, all he ever did was search for Alois Lange, his persecutor at Auschwitz in every corner of the United States. He never found him, but he got awfully close. So close that he found his American wife. Those drawings are important. They could lead right to the hiding place of a Nazi Criminal. - But aren't they all dead? - Not all of them. Life expectancy has risen, you know. So what am I supposed to do with this stuff? You can take it to Mordechai Midler. He flushed out more than 700 Nazi Criminals. - Why didn't you talk to him for 30 years? - He didn't love me. I have some materials that maybe of service in capturing a Nazi war criminal named Alois Lange. Teeth. I am interested in teeth, my dear boy. Ever since the Nazis died, became too old to be extradited, I'm looking for the teeth. Whatever happened to all the gold teeth Jews had? Tons of teeth. Stashed away in some safe, somewhere? Or hanging around the necks of some Grande Dames? You see I wanna know ! Because those teeth are ours. Something is not quite right here, I'm not exactly sure, but something... . I know, because this is not an argument for trendy boys like you. Your father, he spoke to me about you. Are you gonna look for Aloise Lange? No, I'm looking for the teeth like I said. You really take after your father. You're both rather pedantic. My instinct tells me that pedantry is Is an essential characteristic for capturing Nazis. True. But solitude is the playground of resentment. Your father was too much alone. He started feeding his resentment toward someone who was a lot less wicked than many others. I know who Alois Lange is. He's a nobody. Besides, he's gotta be 95 by now. So chances are, 9 out of 10 he's already dead. But did the two of you ever actually look for him? A little. He was a small fish. - We were hunting sharks. - Of course. That makes a bigger impression. What are you insinuating? That even Nazi Hunters follow the rules of show business and go where the biggest publicity will be. I don't let anyone play me for a fool looking for publicity. - We all play the fool sometimes. - Yeah, speak for yourself ! All dressed up like that ! Now listen up boy, I sacrificed my own life in order to find those bastards. That's not exactly what I would call show business. A lot of Jews who survived, they got over it, but not me. I'm 79 years old, I'm still living in 1940. Just like your father. - You a practicing Jew? - No. - You know about the Holocaust? - In a general sort of way. And your father? Did you know your father? In a general sort of way. Where the fuck have you been living all this time? How are you around dogs? I have a dog, my wife looks after him. I take care of mine. Name is Who. Fucker's full of rage inside, but he don't show it. Like you. Now, whaddaya say, I get your cell phone number from you? I never had a cell phone. Before the inferno, my life could be summed up in a single word-- lightheartedness. As a child I liked to stare at the Polish sky, the same sky that later I saw from the camp, stained with black stripes, the smoke of my relatives. Yet that macabre vision did not prevent me from enjoying the beauty of the sky. Another monstrous thought, like all the thoughts people in the inferno had.

He's grown into a very handsome man, except, I think he has false teeth. Why are you laughing? Oh, it's just that they're so perfect, I can't believe that they're real. Maybe you're right.

Enough to decide to stop. You like tattoos? I was just asking myself that, when I was looking at you. I don't know. I haven't made up my mind. I make tattoos for a living. - That must be a good job. - Not a job. It's an art. Have you noticed how nobody works anymore, and everybody does something artistic? And what do you do? At this particular moment? I'm tryin' to fix up a sad boy... and a sad girl, and it's not easy. I suspect... that sadness is not compatible with sadness. I fixed up my aunt - she's handicapped - with a friend of mine. A barber, good barber. It's a beautiful thing. They keep each other company... and they're grateful to me. Another beautiful thing: gratitude. Life is full of beautiful things. True, but gratitude is the most beautiful thing of all. And what are you doing here in this godforsaken place. I'm looking for a Nazi criminal from Auschwitz. Really? Aren't they all dead? That's what I thought too, but apparently they're not. And what are you gonna do when you find him? - Would you like to kill me, dear? - No ma'am. Why would I want to do that? I'm John Smith, a former student of yours. And I was in the area, and I thought I would stop by and say hello. John Smith? No, I don't recall that name. That's odd because I remember all my students. Oh of course, in high school I didn't dress like this, or wear makeup. Then, why do you do it now that you're grown, John? I don't like this, one bit. You have to promise me... that you'll address this problem of yours. - I promise. - That's not the point. The point is... your name doesn't ring a bell. Maybe because it's such a common name. Emily, I want you to be a good girl. Don't make a mess. You have to stay in here, because I have a visitor. - Jackie, do you like my student? - 'Course not. Jackie has a terrible temper. - I really enjoyed your history lessons, ma'am. - Thank you, dear. I still remember one that was very memorable. - About the Holocaust. - The Holocaust? Oh, that's odd. We never used to get to that till the end of the school term. And then we would just rush right through it. - Sometimes I would skip it altogether. - Not my year. I remember it was very touching. Naturally. It... it... It was a tragedy. The children ! No one should ever touch the children. Why did the Germans decide to exterminate the Jews? That... oh dear, that's one of those million-dollar questions, I'm afraid. But so many books have been written about it, and you're a historian, so you must have thought about it. They wanted their money. Their money? - But not all the Jews were rich. - They all had something. - This tea is delicious. - No, it's not, I don't make good tea. I tried to develop the habit... but I have never had a life of habits. How is your husband? My husband is dead, unfortunately. He's been dead for 10 years. I'm sorry. And your children? Nathan lives in Asia. - I never see him. - That's a shame. Well, Nathan was a complicated soul. We do get to see my granddaughter Rachel. I, I get to see Rachel... every once in a while. Emily, be a good girl! Well it's been a real pleasure, but I must be going now. John Smith ... I simply don't remember that name ! It'll come to you, sooner or later. - Hello - Hi. Good night Emily.

He gets over all my crises. What were you doing when you were my age? Other than playing music? Sniffing heroin. - You didn't shoot up? - I'm afraid of needles. - Fear saves us every time. - Every time. But you have to choose a moment in your life, even one, to not be afraid. - And have you chosen that moment? - Yeah. This one. I can't explain why I didn't talk to my father for 30 years. I must have thought that there was mutual contempt. When I was 15, 'I decided' that he didn't love me, because I made up my eyes exactly as I do now. When you're a kid, it's very hard to back off from your decisions. But I pretended to be a kid for too long. And it's only now that I realize... that a father can't help... but love his child. Not having kids... It is really, really screwed me over. Now that I realize it, it's too late. - It's better late than never. - That's not true, Late is late ! There's an Airforce base nearby. Lots of military live here. We also have the biggest pistacchio in the world here. It's a sculpture. It's even in the Guinness Book of World Records. And the littlest one, where is that? I know how to sing. I have no doubt. I don't know how to play. That's not true, my mom says you're a singer. He even sang with Mick Jagger. Actually Mick Jagger sang with me. It was his idea. Wow ! Rock history revealed right here in our house, Tommy ! Can you play something, please? Just one song. I don't play anymore and besides I don't even know if I remember how. My music teacher said once you learn you never forget. Maybe he was just trying to be nice or he wanted to worm some money out of you. Please, just one. Fuck! - What do you want me to play? - "This Must Be The Place" by Arcade Fire. Nonsense, "This Must Be The Place" is by the Talking Heads. - No, it's by Arcade Fire. - Trust me, you're delusional. "This Must Be The Place" is by the Talking Heads. Arcade Fire merely did a cover. ♪ Home is where I... ♪ Where are you going? I was just seeing if the guitar was in tune.

What's your relationship with your father? It's good, even though I never see him. he lives in Hong Kong. He never comes back to America. But there are some dark shadows in my family too. - Oh really? - Like everyone's, I guess. My father, for example, he broke off all relations with his parents years ago. And I never knew why. I asked him a thousand times and he'd never really say. Did you ever ask your grandparents about it? They're just as evasive. Once, when I was twelve, my grandfather told me something I've never forgotten. He said, "Whatever happens, remember I'll always be part of your life." And there were tears in his eyes when he said it. - Do you ever see him? - No, hardly ever. He lives far away... in a little town in Utah. In Huntsville. I can't make love with you, Rachel. I'm married. Before the inferno, there was home. That first furtive kiss in the backyard at age 13. The smells, the stink of home. The black clouds. The thrill of approaching thunder. A child's refuge - the corner near the window. The blanket over me when I was sick with fever. Blissful boredom. And shivers of joy. - Mum! - It was, in short, a mental intimacy. The Camp decrees the loss of mental intimacy. Thus establishing a new kind of death. A breathing death. There are many ways of dying, the worst of them... is to continue living. - Any word from Tony? - No. What are you doing? Are you... out there, trying to find yourself or something? No Jane... I'm not trying to find myself. I'm in New Mexico, not India. When you comin' home? I'll call you later. Was it yours? No. It's Ernie Ray's. Changed the oil recently? About an hour and a half ago. You put too much in it. Too much oil can cause a spontaneous combustion. It can happen. Pretty unusual, but it sure can happen. A lot of unusual things have been happening to me lately. Let's get to the point. What do you think Ernie Ray's gonna say about this? I aint no intellectual, but I do know what things are called. You know what they call this? What's happenin' here is somethin' enormous. Old-fashioned. Something you don't see too often anymore. And this something has a very, precise name. Trust. So let me say one more time, Do not betray my trust. I had a pretty severe upbringing, Cheyenne. I can have a very severe reaction. Hi. Hi What sort of weapon are you interested in? - One that hurts. - Well, you came to the right place. Let me show you something. Yeah, you're looking at it. The only pistol in the world that packs the power of a rifle, without all the bulk. I don't know the first thing about a gun. I do. That pistol here lets you shoot and kill with precision from 250 feet. And it doesn't just give you the satisfaction of the kill, it lets you kill with impunity, which is a whole different ball game. Believe me, it's an extraordinary thing to kill with impunity. A rare shift in perspective in a human being's life story. If we're licensed to be monsters, we end up having just one desire to truly be monsters. - Hey, are you by any chance Cheyenne? - Sorry, what? No, I was just asking. You're Cheyenne, right? No, that's not me. May I sit with you? Oh, certainly, sit down. Are you... uh... traveling? Sight-seeing. - Well, what exactly is the difference? - I don't know exactly the difference. But I always thought that travelers were a pain in the ass. I feel the same way. Death to the backpack. That's a good model you've got there. It's a nice balance between the mechanics and... the storage capacity. Are you in the luggage business? We'll get to that. But first, tell me the reason you wanted to meet me. I'm looking for a German. Well, you come to the right place. Germans come here on vacation. They love it here. Reminds 'em of the Alps. And when they go back home they can say they've been to America. I am looking for a different kind of German. I'm looking for one who lives here, whose name is Alois Lange. He was a friend of my father's. I wanted to pay him a visit. Do you know him? We'll get to that. Now, do you remember back when suitcases with wheels didn't exist? You had to carry your bags or lug them over your shoulder. They were always so heavy. Everybody, sweating, and swearing all the time. And then someone comes along... it was really just a few years ago if you think about it, with the bright idea of putting wheels on the thing. And poof... all at once your suitcase isn't heavy anymore. And everyday I ask myself the same question: 'why didn't anyone think of it sooner?' Why do you ask yourself the same fucking question every day? Because I'm that someone who had the bright idea. - Are you pulling my leg? - No. I'd never do such a thing. I'm Robert Plath. I was a pilot with Northwest Airlines and in 1988 I had an idea, and so I tested it out in my garage, and then I patented it. And I won't call it a success... because it was a revolution. Now, there are 150 residents in Hunstville and only one of them has a German accent. He's pretty slight, and his name isn't Alois Lange. It's Peter Smith. He lives in a log cabin on a hill, heading east. He's older than I am, and more handsome, I think. And I can't say that I like this Peter Smith. What's this about you, not knowin' if you're coming back? I didn't get together with Desmond. You're right. I don't know anything about boys. How are you? Last night mom took me by the hand And she said that pain is not the final destination. What I do understand is that sometimes people leave. My brother left. And you left. Do you hear me, Cheyenne? Tony. - You're nuts ! - Scheisse ! I apologize. But, it's only right you know, I did it on purpose. Aah oh! How did you get in here? Who the fuck do you think I am? Here, I've spent most of my life tracking down these bastards, who've hidden themselves away in hotels all over the world, and you have the nerve to ask how I managed to find my way into a tourist motel in the middle of Utah. How did you know I was here? Ah, yeah. America's a tiny place. It wasn't easy at first. No rental car. No cell phone. I'd never have a cell phone. Never, never, have a cell phone. Well, what am I gonna do? You're a fucking pain in the ass. It's a powerful feeling, but it softened a bit during your absence. It's coming back in full force, now. Alois Lange doesn't live here anymore. He went away. He doesn't go by the name of Alois Lange anymore. He goes by the name 'Peter Smith'. Oh, fucking-A ! A genuine detective ! Pack your beauty case. We're gettin' outta here. - Where are we going? - To the end of life. Exactly where your friend is. How do you know that? I know because my name is Mordechai Midler. I know because I have a phone and 1500 informants. I pick it up, I dial a number, I find people. Now... Get your things. I gotta go take a leak. Hey Cheyenne, come here gimme a hand. This door's... Goddamn thing is jammed. - Are you kidding? - No, no. The fuckin' thing won't open. Alright, do me a favor. Call the guy at the reception desk. He's got a master key. No fucking way. A detective like you who's flushed out thousands of Nazi criminals... and you can't managed to get yourself out of the john ?! You gotta be kidding ! Asshole Why do you have to pull this bullshit on me, at my age? What fine air ! - This may seem trivial, but I... - I was seven years old, I saw the numbers on my father's forearm and I asked him what they were, and he said... And he said, Adam Kohut Eran, "that's our telephone number" That's why Jews always dial the wrong number. I spent most of my life in hotel rooms,... cheap inns, inside a car. Here and in Argentina, Brazil and Syria. You know something? I loved it. And, you know something else? I'm convinced that you liked it too. Because I'm convinced that you're in great need of distraction. You're right, I liked it. Yes, I thought so. This place makes me feel so good. The mountains make me feel at peace with the world. You know. It's like putting on a necktie. Can you even use that pistol? How the fuck did you know I had a pistol? Because I know. Because I've been at war all my life. Never ends. One. Imitation. Hitler had a private study, 2,000 square feet. But he kept telling his architect, it was too small. Goering built a house just like Hitler's. Himmler would have liked to have a house just like Goering's. Bormann would have liked to have a house just like Himmler's if Himmler had managed to build one like Goering's. Everybody imitated anybody else. Everybody, but the Jews. They didn't imitate anyone. Two. Humiliation. If you want to survive, you have to really know the person who is trying to kill you all costs. I survived. Your father tried to kill me for years. Due to the following episode. In the winter, '43, during roll-call. He did something wrong. I don't remember what, however, but I threatened to let the German Shepherd tear him to pieces. The dog growled at him. He was so scared, he peed in his pants. And I... burst(ed) out (with) laughing. That's what happened. That was his humiliation. Compared to the horrors of Auschwitz, it was nothing. But your father never forgot it. He used to write me letters. He would say words most atrocious words, most beautiful words. Letters that my wife, who was a shrewd woman, would send on to me. By the way, she remembered you finally, but not because you were her student. I hated your father because his obsession with me made my life impossible. But I have to say... that he completely won me over. The unrelenting beauty of revenge. The entire life dedicated to avenging a humiliation. That's what I call perseverance. Greatness, even. Three. Theft. The little bicycle. The stolen kiss in the backyard when you're thirteen. Black clouds. The thrill of approaching thunder. The ticking of the clock. Your mother's warm embrace, Your father's smile and caress. The finger tracing letters on a foggy window. The corner seat near the window. The cozy blanket, when you had a fever. The crystal clear Northern European sky. Everyone, absolutely everyone, had their youth stolen from them. Everyone, absolutely everyone, had their lightheartedness stolen from them. On the other side of the barbed wire, we too... we too looked at the snow. And... at God. God is like... God is... God. Never mind. I can't remember anymore. It's such an injustice that my father died before you. Holy shit! Something's not quite right here. I'm not sure what exactly. But something.
