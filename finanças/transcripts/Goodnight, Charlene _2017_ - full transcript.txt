Subtitles by explosiveskull His name was Charlie Potter. Sometimes the name fits the man. Sometimes it doesn't. Charlie's name fit. It was ordinary. It was like he was ordinary. But still waters run deep. The Irish have a proverb. Shake hands with the devil, sometimes you don't get your hand back. I've got a proverb. The law's a bad enemy to make. Charlie worked as a mechanic at Three Sands Auto and Tires. Humble and honest. If you looked up ordinary, you'd find a picture of Charlie. He was usual. The only thing unusual about Charlie was his wife. The beautiful Charlene Potter. Beautiful, that's what was unusual. Charlie was a lot of things. A lot of good things, but beautiful wasn't one of them. His marriage was a mystery that kept Three Sands guessing. Charlene had shown up at Three Sands some years earlier. Not much was known about where she came from and for certain nobody could have guessed where she was going. Charlene definitely had a reason for marrying Charlie. Folks just didn't know it. At least not yet. No doubt about it. Charlene was a killer. And she didn't need a gun to do it. I want out. From what? From Charlie. You want him dead? I just want out. I know what you mean. Your wife's not that bad. Neither is Charlie. I just wanna start my life with you. Is that what you told Charlie? I'm serious. Why can't we leave tonight? And go where? And do what, like for money? No. No, my wife'll hunt us both down and sue me for child support. Or just kill me. Or just shoot me. Just tell me that you wanna try. You need to get that tail light fixed. Always looking out for me. Somebody has to. Guess I'm lucky I could see it's you. Don't you have somewhere you need to be? I'll get there soon enough. Least you're on time for this one. You need to get that tail light fixed. How was your day, love? It was good. Rumor is I got a raise coming. Mr. Flynn needs a floor manager. Well that's good news. I promised to get you out of this town. And I will. Idea cars embodying the latest in automotive styling are previewed in New York. She asleep? Yeah. Supper's in the kitchen if you want any. This TV's a little loud, don't you think? You can turn it down. Production this year or ever. But this and its companion idea cars sound even more futuristic, will guide engineers of America's major companies who spent millions on their development. Can't listen to that TV so loud when you're putting her to bed. You're gonna wake her up. Can I ask you a question? What? Why'd you marry me? I'm serious. I don't know what you want from me. The truth. Go put her to bed. Go! I want a gun. What are you gonna do with a gun? You're never here. I don't feel safe. I'm never here? I'm always here. Not until late. Okay. You want a gun, I'll get you a gun. From where? Oh, from Santa. I know a guy, owes me a favor. Don't worry about it. How are things, Charlie? Very good, sir, you? Well, I'll cut right to it. Charlie, you're the best man I got. If I had 10 more Charlie Potters, it wouldn't be enough. I want you to be my new floor manager, to be my right hand man and my left. I appreciate that sir, but a lot of guys would be better for that job than me. Pete would be great for it. You really feel that way? Yes sir, I do. It's because you feel that way that you're the man for the job. Now, I won't take no for an answer. Pays an extra 400 a month. Dollars? Cents wouldn't do you much good, boy. Good day now. You Chino? That is me. I hear you need some documents. I have three employees coming in from the border. 25 dollars a piece. When and where? Pistol Pete's tonight. Fine. My father brought that back to me from the war. An American soldier gave it to him for saving his life. You were in that war, no? In another lifetime. You must have stories. We all have stories. Of course. You desire to go straight to business. Very American. You are an American too, I hear. Half of me, yes. My father was a Spaniard. My mother? A dark eyed Mexican. Really I think she was a Gypsy. She was very beautiful though. Very beautiful. You believe there's only one right love for us all? Very well. What kind of documents your workers require? The usual, birth certificates, social security card, driver's license. 100 dollars. Fine. But I need them in three days. Oh and don't even think about trying to strong arm me. I know this town like the back of my hand. Every dirty little nook and cranny. Oh and Chino. Next time we talk, get your boots off the desk. Out west, that could get a man injured. I loved your dad, darling. From the ground to the top. Anytime I can help my niece out, I'm in. My father adored you, Sam. I wasn't always the best brother. Yeah you was never the best brother. Billy. So is there a way? There's always a way. Son would you allow me a private moment with my niece? Sure, Sam. Be back in a shake. Can we trust him? I love him. I know you do, darling. But when you're gonna do what we're gonna get into, love don't matter. Can I trust him? I can trust him. Sam, we can trust him. I can trust his remember to himself. And actually in the end, that's all that matters. What'd I miss? Old Charlie's got a dangerous job, don't he? Crawling under all those old heavy cars. What if one was to slip? Oh I think it'd kill him. Most likely. Okay. Well that takes care of Charlie. What about the money? Aye, if proper pressure is applied to in the right places, old Flynn'll spew forth settlement money like pus. Yeah but who's Flynn? Flynn's the rich old crank that owns the Three Sands Auto and Tires. Okay, why'll he pay up? Stay out of court, stay out of jail, to stay alive. The law's a bad enemy to make. How much? Uh, hundred thousand. Hundred thousand? - You serious? - Yeah. You think he has that much money? Oh yeah he's got it. Okay. So how much do you get? 20 percent sounds right. I'll drink to that. - Cheers. - Cheers. And leave your wife up to me. In the meantime, you two keep a low profile. By all means, don't be seen together. I'll talk to Max Steiner, at the Desert Air Inn, he'll fix you up with a room, 42C. He owes me a favor. He'll keep his mouth shut. I get the feeling you've done this before, Sam. To your reelection. Masterson. Heard there may be some illegal activity taking place in this establishment. Not so long as you're here. Why'd you park in the front? What difference does it make? FBI, my friend. I don't see any FBI. You don't. Till it's too late. Come on, meter's running. What's the haul today? Only four. Four? Well that's 400 bucks. Of course you know if I find out you're bringing in more than you're claiming. I understand. But I'm not so stupid. Good to know. Keep it that way. Hello, love? Is everything okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, what's going on? You know me too well, Charlie. There's been a death in the family. My great aunt. Uncle Sam needs help with the funeral arrangements, so, afraid I might not even be home tonight. Wow, take as much time as you need. You're too good to me. Dinner'll be in the oven. Don't wait up. Bye bye. Do you need me to do my... Beg your pardon? You can speak English. You know who I am? Yes sir. You know Hector? Yeah, I know him. Hector told me that you know Charlie, is that right? You could say that. Now Charlie's sort of like my family. He's married to my niece, Charlene and, I wanna do something special for him. Kind of surprise. And I need some information that'll help me pull this off. I'd like to know his workstation number, what time he comes to work, what time he leaves. They're kind of on hard times, that's the surprise. I got a little something here that I would like to show my appreciation if you wanna give me that information. It'll really be good for Charlie, you know. I wanna help him out, things like that. So would you be willing to give me that information? It'd be good for Charlie, you know, so. Freak accident. There was near disaster for those within range of the TNT that is the bomb's trigger. Six were injured. The home of Walt Drake was turned into a shamble. I did some checking around. Charlie spends his entire day under 5,000 pounds of steel. That dump hadn't been up to date in years. Kind of funny nobody hadn't died in there legitimately. Charlie's workstation is number three. All we gotta do is file the cross bolt on the car jack that he's under. And he's on his way home. Sound right? It's not gonna happen right away. You're not gonna know until I give you a signal. What's the signal? Who checks your post office box? I do. Good. The day of, there'll be a joker card in your box face up. The least you know, the better. Got it? Do I get a signal? When it comes to settling your score, you'll be the first to know. How long will all this take? I mean once it goes down? I'd expect no more than a week. Two tops. Ice cones. Hey old Sam, I wouldn't let it plague me none. I gotta get that bill through. That's a done deal. What else you got? I got a family matter. I may need the work on. What kind of matter? Ah, personal. Personal? Hell, there's no such word for somebody in public office. I guess we ought to know. Well, I do owe you a favor so you just let me know. Oh I will. And you, any favors? Well now that you mention it, I got the FBI looking in my department. Kind of a big hassle, but, I don't know how we caught their attention way down here. Well I got a few ideas. Well, I'll look into it. Those Mexicans. They a superstitious bunch, ain't they? It's the day of the dead. Let them be. Bunch of damn heathens. You know, I believe I'm drunk enough. I'm gonna participate this year. You're not serious. Sure, you know I may even paint my face like a skeleton. Oh, that'll go big for my Latino constituency. Damn are you ever off the clock? Opportunity comes only once and I'm like a fit woman. No man, she waits for no man. Heavy is the head that wears the crown, as they say. Did you get everything straightened out? For now. How's your uncle? Shattered, Charlie. You all right? Yeah, yeah, just a little distracted, I think. You don't wanna be late. Yeah. Cleaning day. What are you doing? Charlie's gonna be home for lunch any minute. It's fine, I parked a block away. Oh, Billy. Fine. You got any coffee or anything? You don't have time for a coffee. How's your day been so far? How's my day been so far? With Warden Jim Cleaver? I hate small talk. I told you that. Yeah you did. So why are you boring me? Because I don't like what you have to say. That's what I like about you. Ah, sure you do. I do. Did you get the card? Uh, no. No? You nervous? I just keep thinking of that jet pushing us back in our seats as we leave here tens of thousands of dollars richer. That's right, baby. Is Flynn around? I have some documents for him. Yeah, he's in his office. You always walk around with a loaded gun? No. This one's special. A rancher brought this in today to pay for his gambling. That's too bad. People make their decisions. I merely follow their choices. Won't that still make you guilty? I suppose. But we're all guilty of something, my friend. Yeah, but why add to it? Model 94 Winchester. You know rifles? Well not particularly, but that one's a classic. He made a poor trade. What is funny? Ah just reminds me of a story my grandad used to tell me. I love stories. About a guy they called the Texas Sharpshooter. He was down on the border near Terlingua. Anyway he said he was the best shot in the state and one day a man asked him to prove it. So he said all right. Went outside, went to his barn and took a bucket of white paint and I guess it was a corral from the old days and lit it up with his 94 Winchester, sprayed bullets all over the side. And he said just a minute. Went and got a bucket of white paint and painted all over the side of that barn where he'd shot those bullet holes and said see? Every shot's on target. I've known many men like that. But you don't look like one of them. Why is enough not enough? For life there's food, clothing, shelter. That's all that is needed. Anything more is excess, anything less is not sufficient. But in America, enough is not enough. There must always be more, and then more. I think this is a sickness. A hole in the heart that Americans haven't yet learned to fill. So they fill it with objects. In Mexico, this hole is filled with violence. I tell you this because you're an American yet you're sleeping here. This tells me you'll understand. You usually keep your guns loaded? Yeah. I may have to shoot some coyotes later. I'll see you around, my friend. Hey Charlie. Hey Pete. Hey man, I just did a fresh pot of coffee. Cool, thanks. Hey, can you hand me that oil pan? Thanks. Hey how's the wife? She's all right. Mr. Flynn, get over here! Show me. See this, Charlie? This has been filed. No, it's just wear. It's wear and it's been filed. Who would do that? Anything unusual happen today? Anything out of the ordinary? I found a joker card in my post office box. Joker card? It's probably a mixup. I've gotta get cleaned up. Meet me in my office in 10 minutes. Who knew you'd be at work on Saturday? Just my wife. Made anybody mad? Any bad blood in town? Uh, no sir. I wouldn't think so. You think someone tried to kill me? Someone tried to kill you. I just don't know who or why. So what do we do? Can I offer you a drink? No sir, I don't drink. Well, might be a good time to start. Doesn't bring out the best in me. I however have no such compunction. When will your wife expect you back? Late? Maybe not till morning. She knows I pull my all nighters on Saturday night. Good, good. Now I understand how grave the situation is, do you? Yeah it's beginning to sink in. You're a good man, I hope you know that. I want you to know that that's why I'm helping you. If I threw a man like you to the wolves, I wouldn't be able to look into my soul. Well, more than I can now. I trust you, Charlie. Through and through. Do you trust me? Yes sir, I do. Good. Because without trust, we won't be able to get in to what we're about to, you and I. What are we about to get into? Now comes the death of Charlie Potter. First thing we gotta do is call Sheriff Rose. I'll kick him a little cash, he'll filter it to his crooked cops. Probably Masterson. People will see the flashing lights, the commotion. Soon the gossip wheels will be spinning in our direction. A report will be written and filed, all official. We'll need crime scene photographs, graphic ones with your head pinned under the Cadillac and blood seeping into your boots. Take a little makeup and stage blood. We'll need a death certificate. Of course we can't get one legally issued without an autopsy since you didn't die in a hospital. But I know of a medical examiner, he'll be game for a little cash. Last thing will be the funerary arrangements. People gotta see the body get planted. At least a coffin. I know the Three Sands Funeral Director. He's been after me to die for years. Really slimy character. Still, as long as the plot's bought and the custom coffin is ordered, one of those waterproof ones that are guaranteed for at least 20 years, he won't care who's stuck in the ground. That's it. Once you're dead, you can start over. Someplace better than this. Starlight. This is it. I got the card this morning. Charlie hasn't called all day. Okay. Okay listen to me. Nothing's official until it's official. His death. This is it, Billy. Why wouldn't it be official? Who's that? Let me call you back. Who are you again? I'm deputy Sheriff Masterson. What's happened? As I said at the door, there's been an accident. Where's my Uncle? He's been notified. Here's the skinny. Your husband's dead. Dead? It's an accident at work. A car fell on his head. Just an accident? Yes, ma'am. That's what we think right now. Did Charlie have a beef with anybody around town? No, everyone loves Charlie. Has he been... Identified? Yes ma'am. By who? Old man Flynn, he owns the garage. Yeah I know him. Is that who found him? That's right. I have some papers I need you to sign. Do I need to go down to the station? No ma'am. We'll take care of it right here. It's a copy of the death certificate, then a form that states I've given you information on the case. Would you rather wait for your Uncle? No, that's not necessary, I'll sign. So there are no suspects? No ma'am. Not right now. Can I talk to Flynn? What's this concerning? Personal matter. You're in a public office. I'm entrusted with public secrets. Well I didn't vote for you. I bet you will now. Send him in. So, to what do I owe the honor? Family. You got a nice operation here, Flynn. Been a pillar of Three Sands for years. I'd hate to see all that you've worked for tied up in court for negligence. Now look, if this has to do with Charlie's death, that was an accident. The police report ruled it was an accident. Maybe. Maybe it was a mixture of bad luck and negligence. Anyway. What matters, is what the court will say. And the court will say what I say. You haven't had a safety inspection for years. Either way let's say the court sides with you, it's gonna cost a thousand dollars to feed the machine. A thousand of your dollars, Flynn. And months of headache. Not to mention the black eye it'll leave this place. A lot more than it is now. Where are you taking this? To a solution. A solution for you? I have the satisfaction of knowing that I kept it simple. I assume that the solution involves money. Charlie's widow lost her breadwinner. Plus the death of her husband. I think you owe her a settlement. After all, your garage killed Charlie. How much? Hundred thousand. I don't have that kind of money. Oh, you got it, and you'll use it. And if I don't? If you know what's good for you, and if you don't, I got all kinds of friends in all kinds of places. And if I pay you? You're not gonna pay me. You're paying the Potters wife. You go away, like we never talked? That's right. How do you wanna do this? 100,000 in a plain black briefcase. Here's the place. I want you to make the drop, Flynn. Nobody else. Keep it simple. Anyone else brings that briefcase, well, it better be you. This part's just between me and you. Okay? Lay it on me, Sam. I need a shot first. Figured you would. So now you wanna trade in your current model for Charlene. But you got a kid. And you're afraid of dodging prison time for not paying child support. Sound right? Yeah sounds right. But the only way to achieve that freedom is death. You saying you're gonna kill me? We're gonna kill you. You're gonna have a car crash two days hence. You won't survive. That's only on paper. Then with death certificate in hand, you and Charlene are going to leave the dim lights of Three Sands far far behind. - Cheers. - Cheers. God! What are you doing? I'm waiting up for you. Okay. Is there a problem? I don't know, you tell me. I don't know, I don't have a problem. Billy, I wanna know where you're going at night. Huh? Who are you seeing? What? I go to work and I come home. I just have no idea why you hate me so much. 'Cause you make it so easy. We done? Am I done? What are you doing? What are you doing? You're gone all the time, you're completely, who's this person you've turned into? Baby this is your warning. What? You need to be a father and a husband. What's gotten into you? You finally grow a spine or something, jeez. Maybe. Baby, you have no idea. Maybe I don't. You wanna inform me? I just did. That beach, that's where I wanna be. On the sand under the palm trees. Just grow old there. Maybe even start a family. Yeah, yeah, man, if that's what you want. It is, baby. But what would I do for a job? Oh, we'd have the settlement money. Oh yeah but I mean I gotta get a job. I can't just show up to Hawaii with a bag of money. I gotta launder the money. Well you could be an artist. Whatever you want, baby. I have to make the arrangements tomorrow. For Charlie's funeral. Yeah. Gotta admit, I feel kind of funny being in Charlie's house in Charlie's chair watching Charlie's TV with Charlie's wife. Do you really feel that way? Yeah I'll just try not to think about it. Think it'll pass. How are you? Well, been better. You? Been better. Been thinking. About? About right, wrong. Far as I can tell, I've done right all my life. Here I am. Right or wrong, I guess in the end it don't matter much. I guess not. I've been doing some digging and I know who tried to kill you and who's been trying to shake me down for hush money. Who? Several people, three to be exact. One is Billy Barlow, you know him? I heard of him. Works as a bartender at the Starlight. Down on his luck vet, really a lowlife, wife and kid. Who else? Mayor Sam. That's Charlene's uncle. He wouldn't be mixed up in all this. As soon as he thought you were dead he showed up at the shop and threatened to sabotage me and the business if I didn't pay out to him. And to Charlene. So who's the third man? Charlene. My wife's the third man? You can't prove that. I wish I couldn't. Sam's shaking me down for hush money and giving a cut of it to Charlene is proof enough. And she's been seen at the Desert Air Inn with Sam and with Billy Barlow. Most of the time she's just been in there with Barlow at the Desert Air. I am sorry, Charlie, I truly am. Hey Sheriff, good to see you. What's your plan, Sam? Well, I'm gonna stage a car accident. And it's got to look real. And you know, you know where Cherry lane is. Out there, the hill goes into that big curve down there? Right. It's a good spot, there's been lots of accidents there. There have, that's why we picked it. Now, the plan is we're gonna take this car, put it in drive, start it down that hill and let it build up speed and overturn right there in front of that big oak tree. In that clearing, that big oak tree. And it's at night, I assume? Less people, less traffic at night. The later you do would be better. The only thing you ever have out there at night is teenagers parking or something. Well if that happens, you maybe make a swipe by there and just like checking the area. Go through there and hit them lights, then they'll scatter like mice. And now see I told Billy to tell his wife. And by the way it's supposed to be raining I think. I checked the weather report. Now I told Billy to tell his wife that he had to run an errand. Setting this up, see. And it had to be a good errand, not some phony deal. So that's how we're gonna get him out of his house but I wanna make sure the wife knows it, see? Well let's keep as few people as we can on this inner circle. Less people we have involved in it, the better off we're gonna be. I don't want a bunch of people coming around asking questions. Now I can get the pictures done if you can get to the press. - I got them. - Get the paperwork and, all right now what are you gonna do? You're not just gonna go send an empty car down through there. Well. What do you think? What's your idea? Well you want to have a body, I'd say. Can you get a body? I got lots of bodies. Okay good. See that, that's now look. I think that's the best. If we could rig a fire somehow and have the car burnt up and then the body charred then I think that'd be the best. Get rid of a multitude of sin with a big enough fire, that's for sure. Look, I'll handle the press. You don't have to worry about the press. Yeah I don't wanna talk to them. You need to take care of the newspaper, radio. I don't wanna talk to any of them reporters. Yeah. I'll get the accident report filled out. I can get the coroner to sign off on it. Of course now you're gonna have to send something his way, but he'll cooperate. Well yeah, we can do that. You know I can do that. So, we can take care of it. The main thing is we get that paperwork from the state saying that he was declared dead. Don't worry about the paperwork. I'll handle that. You're gonna tell your wife that you passed a stray dog on the crossing near Cherry Lane. Where? The highway that the oak's on. Then you say you're worried about it being in the rain. The dog? That's not gonna work. Why? She's not gonna buy that. Why? See I don't worry about a dog a day in my life. Well what do you worry about? Money. Money? Money. I could tell her that I had to drive a drunk customer home because he didn't wanna wait for a taxi. And he's gonna pay me to do it. That is better. Hey thanks for coming in so early on such short notice. No problem. So what's the skinny? There's something going down tonight. Something similar to the Charlie situation. Could even be related. On what? Flynn, don't ask too much of me. I'm only telling you this 'cause I think you need to know. You need to keep your eyes open. I understand. Thanks. Ah, morning. How you doing? I guess I always knew it was true, I mean. I don't know, I knew something was up. Why would a woman like that even marry me in the first place? Something's going down tonight. I don't know what. But we better keep our heads up. Then it's over? After tonight? I think so. Can't wait to get out of this town. Given any thought to where you'd like to relocate? Yeah Mr. Flynn, I considered it. Big news, baby. Tonight's the night. What's gonna happen? I'll be killed in a car accident. So after tonight, whole town's gonna think that I'm dead. And once Sam gets the death certificate signed we are home free from this place. Tomorrow's Charlie's funeral. I know. It's twisted, isn't it? Isn't that a little soon? For what? Die tonight, get buried tomorrow. Sam's got it all figured out, okay? Just don't worry about a thing. But it's too soon, it looks suspicious, Billy. If you just listen to what I tell you to do everything is gonna be fine. This isn't gonna work. Tomorrow. I need you to go to Dallas. I'm gonna meet you there the day after with the money. Then you and me, on the first flight out of DFW to Honolulu. Now listen. After tonight, we can't see each other anymore. So don't call me. Okay? Okay. We're so close to being done. Okay. Blue skies, palm trees. That. I told you we can't talk on the phone, okay? So I won't talk to you for two days? I'll see you in Dallas. Billy? Daddy. Hey, baby. What are you doing? What are you doing? I forgot my wallet. You wanna tell what you did? Now tell him what you did today. I made dinner. You made dinner? - Yeah, she helped. - Yeah. Yeah? I bet it's really good. I wish I could eat with you guys but I gotta go. Back to work. Why do you always have to go to work? I got a customer in the truck. He's drunk, he said he'll pay me to take him home, so. But I'm gonna be back. It's cool? We're not gonna be waiting up. I'm coming back. Okay? You do whatever you gotta do. I'll be back. You sure you wanna do this? Yeah, I gotta face him. Yeah. I guess you do. But if something goes left, you might get killed, I won't be able to help you. Yeah I understand. Well if you're gonna do this, you're gonna need what's in that case. If you're gonna shoot a man, use a gun that already has blood on it. Are you gonna shoot him, Charlie? You are being played, Sam. I'm being played? How much is it worth to you? Are you strong arming me? In my own town? Are you playing me in my police station? Well who bought this station for you? How much? 200. Five. Fine. Fine. But don't ever ask for any more favors. Now who's playing me? Your boy Charlie, he ain't dead. Flynn took him under his wing, got him hid out in the desert somewhere. He faked his death, he faked the whole thing. So Flynn's got something planned for the dropoff tonight. I'm gonna need an escort. I think we can arrange something. Good. Charlie ain't dead. What? I mean, he ain't dead. You're certain? To a certainty. Flynn's been backing Charlie all the way. I bet he spent a fortune on him. So what does that mean for us? I mean Charlene's already in Dallas by now probably. It means that Charlie's out there somewhere looking to put a bullet in both of us and maybe Charlene! Did you think there wouldn't be a consequence? I could kill you right here and nothing will change for me. Are you gonna settle back and maybe we can figure a way out of this. Look, Flynn doesn't know we know. So the drop's still on for tonight. In that briefcase is either the money or it's a ringer. Either way, I got a cop escort. Act normally. Whoever shows up, we'll take him to Flynn or the money. And we still get paid. You still meet Charlene in Dallas. And you two still fly away from DFW to Hawaii. You in? Yeah, I'm in. Masterson is gonna meet us there. The place you got killed. Shotgun's mine. Take your pick. You sure you can handle that? Our escorts will be here in a few. You might wanna get some rest. Now where is that crooked cop? Is that them? No, it's the wrong direction. There. Yeah that's more like it. Well I was gonna call the cops. And in local news, William Barlow, local Three Sands bartender was killed in a one vehicle accident yesterday on Cherry Lane when he lost control of his vehicle and collided with a large oak. No words yet on the condition of the oak. So it's been three days and you hadn't found the bartender or the briefcase? The bartender doesn't have the money. Charlie does. So where's Charlie? I'll find him. Yeah. Yeah I know you'll find him. Because if you don't, you'll no longer be under my protection. Now is there anything else I can do? Just so you know, I'm going independent. So you need to pay me for the work I did on faking Charlie's death. I know you got a whole lot more money out of old man Flynn than what you're letting on. Well if that's what you really want. Charlie, it's been three days, I was worried. I had some loose ends to tie up. I took Billy and dropped him off with his wife where he belongs. Buried the money in my grave. Well, it's supposed to be my grave. Nice touch. Thanks. Sam's dead. I heard, it's all over the radio. Who did it? Masterson. Sheriff Rose was found dead in his office this morning. Bullet in his head. Apparently he has a safe behind the desk where he keeps his shakedown money. Who did it? Same one that took out Sam. Masterson's gone rogue. FBI's gonna be down here for sure. Well. Ain't our problem. Except it is. How's that? Did you see Masterson kill Sam? Well no, not directly. I rolled up right after the deed. Did he see you? It's possible. Charlie, there are good cops and there are bad cops. Masterson? He's one of the worst. Guys like Masterson don't have a jurisdiction. Wherever you go, he will find you and he will kill you. So what am I supposed to do, kill him? Why I ain't no cop killer. I know you aren't. But this cop is a killer and he will kill you. And you can bet that he knows you've got the money. We need to find a new place to hold up, figure this whole thing out. Well, Charlie. You have led him right to me. You cut through the garage, pick up the cash and get out of this town. Charlie, it's Chino. Don't shoot, I'm coming in. Takes a cop to kill one. Don't look so surprised, Charlie. It's a border town. Got FBI crawling all over the place. I'll pull my truck around. You can help me load him up. I got a hole in the desert going straight to hell waiting for him. Where's the accent? Show's over. I knew it was fake. What's your real name? What's yours? Charlie Potter. He's dead. It's all in there. Birth certificate, Social Security card, driver's license. So what's your name? Randall Stevens. I'll have my people slip you across the border tonight. After that, you don't know us. That's a good looking suit. This is harder than I thought. Death and goodbyes are best handled the same way. Just ride on and pull into the next station. And Charlie, make yours a good station. Charlene was never seen or heard from again. Course nobody really looked much either. Chino gathered all the evidence the FBI needed for a corruption case. All the dirty deeds, illegal arrests and murders. They all pointed to one place. No one would be opening the Starlight today. Billy and his wife stayed in Mexico. Word is his wife had family in Acuna. They never turned up north of the border again. Turns out that Three Sands had an opening for mayor and I decided to step in. Why not? It was the only legitimate election folks in Three Sands could remember. No fuss was kicked up over Sam. Folks figured his past had finally caught up to his future. Either way, Sam was gone. Chino's smuggling operation had done well. Too well. He played both sides of the law like a Mozart. Trouble is he made himself at home in the desert, but he was just a guest. Or else he had too many irons in the fire. Or too many fires. Either way, as the man said, live by the sword. Heard Charlie took Sam's shakedown money and with my blessing turned it into a loan to buy his own garage. First of every month Charlie mailed me a check from his new operation. Had the debt paid off in a year. I sure hope Charlie found somewhere green. Subtitles by explosiveskull
