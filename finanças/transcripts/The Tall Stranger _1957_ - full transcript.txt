Easy, boy. We got a long way to go. If you're looking for your gun you won't find it. It was Pagones' idea. He told me you'd wake up shooting. My shirt's been washed and mended. Was that Pagones' idea too? No, mine. And the wagon, the little boy? Mine. Then Pagones' your husband. My husband is dead. That leaves me wondering why I'm not. You almost were when we found you. Your horse was dead and his body was stiff. You must have been there an awfully long time. You gonna talk to him, Cap, or do I? Mister, will you come over here? We'd like to have your name. Bannon, Ned Bannon. I guess the woman, Ellen, I guess she told you how we found you. Yes, she told me. Do you mind saying just how you drew that bullet? I mean, your horse dead, you shot up and all... You got to understand how it is, mister. We got women and children to think about. Maybe whoever shot you, maybe they might get a notion to come lookin' for you, finish the job. We're waitin', Yankee. I was travelin' west. Where to? Where you going? Bishop's Valley. Never heard of it. Well, that's funny, you're headin' for it. I said I never heard of it. Let him go on, Pagones. When I hit that rise in the trail where you found me, I guess, I ran onto a small bunch of cattle, about a dozen hands ridin' herd. Just about as I started wonderin' what a small outfit like that was doin' around here, someone in the rocks put a bullet in my horse, and then in me. But why? I mean, why would he do that if you wasn't doin' nothing? I don't know. Unless I was seein' somethin' I wasn't supposed to be seein'. Well, did you see him? Did you see who shot you? Not clear enough. Mister, you must have seen somethin'. Fancy spurs and a rifle is all I seem to remember. How come we didn't see no cattle, no tracks, nothin'? You know, I was just figurin' to ask you that same question. What's that supposed to mean? All right, all right, that's enough palaverin' for one night. Not by a long shot, it ain't. Come on, mister, want you to sit down, look at that side. Somebody get this fella some food. I said I ain't done talkin'! Pagones, he's wounded. He hasn't eaten in days. I know he ain't eaten. I ain't got nothin' against his eatin'. I want to hear what he has to say. Pagones... Yankees ought to be good at talkin', they're good at everything else... Rapin', burnin', thievin'... You still fightin' the war? ...but mostly burnin'. Don't make much difference what they burn. Cattle, chicken, women, kids... Just like the smell of roastin' flesh, ain't that so, Yankee? I said ain't that so! You go to hell. Don't do it, Pagones! You'll kill him. I warned ya. I warned you it was a mistake to bring him but you wouldn't listen. Do you see that? He backed down. Backed down nothin', he knew he'd have killed him. I'll get you some coffee. You done all right, mister. For a moment there, you had me worried, but you done all right. Mary, bring Mr. Bannon here some food. Sit down. Here you are, sir. I reckon seein' them Union colors on you was what got him all riled up. The Yankees burned his home down durin' the war. That happened to a lot of people, both sides. Yeah, it did at that. Me among 'em. Only I got the wife and kid out before mine went down. Pagones, he didn't. Mmm... That tender? Ah, it's not bad. That was a mean-lookin' wound. I never seen a gun wound like it. There was a hole the size of a silver dollar where it came out. Lucky thing it missed the bone. Here, Papa. Thanks. Now, Mary, you and your ma go on to bed. I'll be along. Mary, do you hear me? Yes, Papa. Mary, I'll walk you to your wagon. My daughter and that young fella are fixin' to get married as soon as we get settled. Where would that be? California. What? Uh-huh, that's where we're headin'. 'Course some of us may trail north up into Oregon. What are you doin' way down here? I mean, if it's the coast you're after, you should be up on the Humboldt. We're just takin' this trail, that's all. What trail? There's no trail. Not past Bishop's Valley. Just a series of ridges no wagon's ever been across, and desert. But there is a trail, a good trail, right, Cap? Why, sure there is. All the way through. No high passes, just good green land once we get beyond this here one dry stretch. Who told you this? Why, I did. How's the patient, Mr. Judson? Well, he's ornery, Mr. Harper. Full of talk about no trail. No trail? Well, Mr. Bannon's obviously not been in this region too long. Wouldn't you say so, Mr. Purcell? I'd say so. Long enough to know this trail leads to Bishop's Valley, not beyond. There's nothin' beyond. Bishop's Valley. Not too many people have heard of that place, Mr. Bannon. I've heard of it. Is this somethin' we ought to know about, Mr. Harper? It's a big pasture land, Cap. About thirty miles of it. Man there by the name of Bishop. Hardy Bishop. He lets his cattle run loose like he owns every inch of it. You'll see for yourself, we cut through it in a couple of days. Cut through it? Cut through Bishop's Valley? As far as Onion Creek. Then we switch back over Shepherd's Pass. You work there, mister? Is that it, did you work there? Before the war. And yet you say there's no trail? Not out of that valley, there isn't. Tell me, Mr. Bannon, you've been away a long time? Since the war. Hmmm. Then someone ought to tell you. They broke that trail about a year ago. Tell him about it, Mr. Purcell. Just a year ago. Well, gentlemen, it's been a long day. Yeah, guess I'll turn in. Let's all turn in, we'll get a fresh start in the mornin'. 'Night, Mr. Bannon. If there's anything I can do for you, Mr. Bannon... I'll talk to Cap and the others about your staying with us at least as far as the Valley. They're a little upset tonight but I don't think it'll be much of a problem. Besides, we can use a good trail man. Good night. I'm going to stretch out by the fire. I just came for my pillow. You've made a good start, first Pagones, and then Harper. This Harper... What about him? How'd he come to be with this wagon train? We'd gathered in Cannon City, to organize our equipment before traveling west over the Humboldt. We met Harper, and his friend Purcell. They said they were traveling west themselves and asked us to join them. They said that this new trail they knew about through the valley was shorter and easier by hundreds of miles. Well, one thing they didn't tell you. Nobody's ever cut through Hardy Bishop's land and lived to see the other side. Why should this man Bishop try to stop us? What harm could we possibly cause just by passing through? It isn't a matter of harm. You'd be breaking the law. Bishop's law. Nobody does that. And I think Harper knows it. If he knew it, why would he bring us this way? I don't know. Beats me. You know a lot about this man Bishop, don't you? He's my half-brother. Oh, I see. Well, then you can talk to him for us. You owe us that much, I think. Maybe I do. But you see, if anything, I'm going to be even less welcome in that valley than you are. Eighty four head, hear? Was that it, Stark? Eighty four. It'd take a fool or a maniac to rustle cattle off of my land without some inside help. And I know a sight of both. Now who was it? How much did he give you? I tell you, Mr. Bishop, I never seen him. I had nothin' to do with it. I've got better sense than that. Sounds to me like he's tellin' the truth, Hardy. Well, I don't think so. Get your gear and be out of here in 10 minutes. And don't come back. Chavez is comin'. Well? Ah, we lost 'em. Eighty four head of cattle and you lost 'em? We trailed 'em as far as Jawbone Canyon but there was a lot of wind, the dust covered their tracks. Well, they weren't prime stock, Mr. Bishop. I don't care if a cow's fifteen years old and three-legged, if it's a Bishop cow. Nobody steals my beef and gets away with it. At least they wouldn't if I had a crew that knew its business. From now on, there'll be two men at every line cabin 24 hours a day. And one man better be awake all the time. Go on, get something to eat. Something else wrong? Why, uh... I don't know, sir. We, we saw a wagon train. What? That's right, sir. Headin' this way. Those thievin' cattle rustlers? No, sir couldn't be. These people hardly got enough stock to haul their gear. They're southerners for the most part. We spotted them coming out of the north canyon. How many were there? Don't know. They got women and kids with 'em though. Did they see you? Ah, I do not think so. One of them was a Yankee. A Union soldier. Officer, it looked like. Blue coat. Gold stripe on his pants. And he was ridin' point, well, like he knew the trail. Bannon? I... I'm not sure. Bannon. We didn't see him very close... Who else would... No. He wouldn't have the guts to come back here. If it was one thing Bannon had, Hardy, it was guts. But no sense. If he had any, he'd know what to expect if he came back here. Say those wagons, Mr. Bishop, we could, well, we could turn 'em at the ridge before they set their stock to grazin'. The wagons will wait. Hardy, you ought to give it a lot of thought before you do something you'll be sorry for. I've given it thought. For four years I've givin' it thought. And in case I forgot to, there's a grave out there in the meadow to remind me. Billy was executed by the Federal Government. For fighting for what he believed in! Quantrell's raiders. Bully boys. Lootin', burnin', killin'. North and South alike, made no difference to him. He was having a picnic! What's the difference. My boy is lying out there in a stinkin' hole and Bannon put him there. That's all over and done with, Hardy. It will be, soon. Like you said, Stark, one thing Bannon had was guts. And I'm gonna spill 'em all over the ground. Did this Bannon gent really kill Bishop's son? In a way, I suppose he did. Young Bishop, he was a bad kid almost from the time he could walk. And Hardy, heh, he spoiled him rotten. He was no good. No good at all. Bad enough to kill? Bad enough to kill. Somebody had to do it someday. We all knew that. All except Bishop, huh? Bannon was a Union troop commander, cavalry. Some of Quantrell's boys, Billy included, made the mistake of underestimating him. They got caught. Tried and executed the same day. I brought his body back from Leavenworth a week later. Well, then, Bannon didn't kill him. He didn't help him to get way either. Yee-haw! Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! We're there! We're there, I tell you! Man, wait'll you see it! Bishop's Valley? Yeah, couple o' miles up! Yoo-hoo! Man, there's grass two feet deep! Where's Bannon? Up ahead. That's green, man, you never saw nothin' like it! Spread the word, Dud. Tell 'em to pick 'em up... Well, there she is. Holy Saint George! Thirty miles of the richest pasture land this side of Salt Lake. Enough water, timber and game to last a man a lifetime. All for the taking. What did you say? Let's take 'em down to that meadow, Cap. Camp there for a day or two and rest up before going on. What do you say? What're we waitin' for. Let's take 'em! Yee-haw! "All for the takin'", is that what you said? Did I, Mr. Bannon? You give me that bucket. Go on and play. Hello. We haven't seen much of you lately. Sorry. Oh, nothing to be sorry about. Hey, how's your side? I'm as good as new, thanks. Light the fire! How long do you think it will be before he pays us a visit? Ordinarily, the wagon train would never have gotten this far. He must be waitin' for me. Do you think Bishop knows you're with us? He knows, all right. We've been watched for the past three days. Well, when are you going to see him? Soon. Couple of things I'd like to find out first. One of 'em is what this Harper is really up to. Why does he have to be up to something? You're so suspicious, Mr. Bannon. Could be. Another thing I'd like to find out is, about you. What are you doin' out here alone? Going west, like everybody else in the wagon train. You're not the type, any more than Harper is. Oh? What type am I? Suppose you tell me. My husband was killed in the war. I was left all alone with my son. So I decided to sell all my furniture, everything I had left, and head west. Then I met these people in St. Jo. I'm sorry about your husband. Thank you. There's just one thing doesn't figure. You bein' alone all this time. Like I said, you're not the type. You're a man's woman. I just haven't figured out which man yet. Well, when you do figure it out, let me know. Wait a minute. I'm sorry. I just wanted to get you mad enough so you'd tell me something about Harper. Oh, I see! You've decided that I'm Harper's woman. Is that it? Well, I could do worse. Like you, for instance. Man, what a notion! Now, why didn't I think of somethin' like that! Somethin' like what? Stayin' on. What did you say? Why, it's Harper's idea. Why go to California, he says. Got everything we need right here. Strip this land, get the seed in... Where is he? Harper? Oh, he's up by the wagons. Pagones' wagon, I think. Talkin' it over with Cap and... What got into him? So, all I'm sayin' is, why go on? Now, you all want homes, with free land and plenty of water and game and sun. A place to raise your kids, maybe. Or forget some sore memories. Well, what better place than this? Now look, I figure it'll take you about a month to build your homes. You all have plenty of tools and there's enough timber here to build a town. In the meantime, you can start in with your plantin'. Yeah, but what about California? You can all still go on if you want. 'Course it'll mean losing a year's harvest. And there's always the Indians to worry about. I like it. I like what he says. Just a minute! You can't live here, you don't own this land. Well, there's plenty here for us all. Not here there isn't. This land belongs to Hardy Bishop. He settled it. He owns it. You're mistaken, Bannon. This is government territory. Every citizen has the right to homestead. You try that, all you'll have is a pack of widows. This valley is 30 miles long. I say there's room here for all of us. Now, if Bishop doesn't think so... Well, I think we can handle trouble if it comes to that. That makes sense to me. I'm for stayin'. Now I get it. Get what, Mr. Bannon? You never intended to cross that pass, Harper. Never intended to from the day you left St. Jo. Mr. Bannon, we promised to bring you as far as Bishop's Valley. Well, this is Bishop's Valley. Dud, bring him his horse. Oh, and one thing more. When you see Bishop, tell him this is a big land. Too big for one man, really. I seen him. He's comin'. Bannon? Yeah. All right, I'll tell him. I want the boys kept out of this. They know. Bannon only did what he thought was right, Hardy. He rates better than that. Not from me, he don't. Hello, Hardy. Get off of my range, Bannon! I want to talk to you. Just two rounds left, Ned. Just one more to waste. Now turn around and get outta here. And take that mangy bunch of squatters with you. He don't want to kill you, Ned. Get out of here before he has to. Not until we talk. We got nothing to talk about. You just got one shell left, Hardy. Are you going to use it? You're going to listen to me, Hardy. You're going to listen if I have to beat it into you. Stay down, Hardy. Don't make me do any more. All right, somebody help him up. Charley, Red. Take him to his room. He really belted you. Hurt much? What do you think? There's some stuff over in the bunkhouse. Ask the boys. They'll fix you up. Glad to have you back, Ned. Thanks. Here you are. All right, Charley. Lie back. Come on, lie back. Sittin' there like a wounded buck, bleedin' half to death. He still here? Yep. I didn't want to kill him. I know. I still don't. But I'm going to. No, you're not. I gave him more of a chance than I ever gave a man before. He's still got a chance. He can get out of here before I'm on my feet again. He won't go, Hardy. Then, I'll kill him. No, you won't. I know you better than that. Why? Because he's my own flesh and blood? You don't know me as well as you think. Hardy, you know Billy was no good. He was bound to get himself killed sooner or later. Get outta here. Ned didn't kill him. You know that, too. Out, Stark! Not yet. Why don't you admit it? Ned's always been more of a son to you than Billy ever could be. You know what kind of a man he is, what principles he lives by. He'd have done the same if Billy had been his own son. Tell the boys to be ready to ride tomorrow. All of 'em. We'll be doin' a little squatter-chasin'. What about Ned? You refusin' to take orders, after 20 years? Go on, tell 'em what I said. All right. Talk to him, Hardy, that's all he wants. Then send him away if you still want to. He'll go. But if he does, you'll be losin' one of the few people in this world who ever cared a tinker's damn about you. Charley. Where is that Comanche! Charley! Morning. I want a steak. Rare. I mean rare. Put a candle under it. Oh, wait a minute. Maybe you'd better make that... I got some mush. Fresh cooked. All right. Make it two. Morning. I heard you the first time. Can we talk now, Hardy? No. It's been four years. I've got a lot of things to say to you. I don't want to hear anything more about Billy. I want to close the book. Me too, Hardy. Me too. Red. Where's Stark? He's over at the barn, Mr. Bishop. Tell him we'll be ridin' in 20 minutes. They won't run, Hardy. They'll run. Not this bunch. I know I came in with 'em. Don't think I ain't been wonderin' about that. If you'd listen instead of flyin' off... I'll listen for 20 minutes. I'll take that, Hardy. Hungry, homeless, stragglers. Call 'em what you want, nothin' you said's gonna keep me from runnin' 'em off my land. And I told you they won't run. Will you try and understand that? You think you're going to go bustin' in and scare 'em out. Well, they've been scared by experts. The only way you're gonna run 'em off is to put 'em underground. I can do that, too. Even if it means killin' women and kids? I didn't bring those women and kids in here. That was their own doing. No, it wasn't, it was Harper, I keep tellin' ya. He brought 'em here. He stopped 'em here. You just sit there and won't listen. All you can think of is how you're gonna chop 'em up and run 'em off. Well, what am I supposed to think of, then? Where is it different than it ever was? People comin' in here, diggin' up my range. First an acre, then 10, then half the valley. All right, so Harper brought 'em in here. What are you askin' of me, Ned? I'm askin' you to let me find out why. Oh, it's clear enough. He's after farming. Harper's no more a farmer than Charley there. Look, I don't know what he's up to any more than you do. But it's something. It's like he was inviting trouble, like he wanted it. Why? What can he expect to do with a handful of people like that? They're a hard headed bunch and right now they think he's God. But he's got to have an angle and I'm going to find it. How're you gonna do it? In time. I ain't got time. Hardy, you got nothin' else but. Those cattle you ran into, you think they were that bunch of mine that were rustled? From what you tell me, about eighty head, dozen men ridin' herd. You think Harper's mixed up in that? I don't see how. The man who shot you, the one with the gold-plated rifle and the fancy spurs... They were the first things I looked for. No one in the wagon train had 'em. All right, I'll make a deal with you. We'll do it your way. Three days your way. Then we do it mine. You got a deal. I'll tell Stark and Chavez, they'll work with you. Uh, anything else you want? Nothin' you got. Meaning what? You got a bushwhacker with a gold-plated rifle? Oh, his kind don't stay in one place. Not for long they don't. He's half way to Texas. Wait here, I'll get Stark. Well, it appears to me this'd be about the best way for everybody. Each family section touches the stream so there'll never be any water problems. There's both graze and timber on each section, dividin' it up this way. No one part of the valley seems to be any better or worse than any other part, so all we got to do is to decide who lives where. Why don't you just number the sections on your map, and then draw those numbers out of a hat? Hey, that's a good idea, boy. I got some paper over there in my wagon, I'll get it and make up the numbers. Hey, Mort, what about you? You'll be settlin' here too, won't you. I sure will. Good, you know, I'm gonna build my house facin' east, with the main room here, like this. To catch the morning sun. And me and ma's bedroom over here, and Ellen and Will over here. Oh, you moving in with the Judsons, Ellen, you and your boy? Well, I tried to talk him out of it but you know Mr. Judson. No, I won't hear another word. Besides, the way things are shapin' up, looks like that young fella Dud's gonna make off with the only one I got. Pa. Oh, now Ma. Mort's no fool, he's got eyes. Mary and Dud - yowlin' around here like a pair of sacked-up cats. We'll throw 'em both in the same sack, that'll cure 'em. Pa! I hear you. Now look, when you get ready to build your own place, you let me know, you hear? I'm a pretty fair country carpenter. You'll hear. You know, Ellen, I sort of thought you'd have a hankering for the same thing. Oh? Like what? Oh, like Mary, home of your own, a man. Some day, maybe. You're not happy, Ellen, I know that. And I know the reason why, too. Oh, you do? Yes. You're not a child, like Mary. A woman like you who's been married, there's things she needs to make her happy, things which she... Look, Mort, if that's a proposal, thanks. I'll think about it. But in the meantime, I'm pretty busy. Hey, Mort! What do you suppose they want? Anything I can do for you? We are riding by, we see you from the trees. Are you Bishop's men? No, we're miners. Si, we have a little mine back in the hills. We run low on tobacco, figured to buy some off you. I think I can fix 'em up. This way. Hey, quite a man, that Mort. No price too high on a fella like that. You're wrong, Adam. Sometimes the price can be too high. Purcell. Here's your tobacco. You, uh, you know what you're to do? We wait for Bishop to come out to attack this train. Then my men and me, we take his ranch. When he returns, we chew up what he's got left. You shouldn't have any trouble. Figure this bunch'll knock off 10 or 12 before they're wiped out, probably wound as many more. Bishop'll be a sittin' duck for you. And for this you agree to pay me... Half the cattle we get. Well? More. Look, Zarata, we made a deal. In fact... In fact, I am wondering what is to keep me from taking all of it. After all, you're only two. We are twelve. All right, take it. Take it all. Something over 5,000 head of cattle. Only that's a lot to unload, Zarata. Where you gonna do it? Remember you're wanted in every state and territory south of the Missouri. They know you, they'll be lookin' for ya. I have friends. Sure. Sure, you have friends. What'd they pay you for the 80 odd head you rustled out of Bishop's herd last week. How you know about this? What was it, Zarata? Three, four dollars a head? Six. I'll get you twenty. Where? That's my business. Twenty, uh? Really twenty. You get that? Cash. So you see, cut me out and you're the loser. Anythin' else? This woman... What? It is curiosity, but I think I see this woman. I doubt that. St. Louis. I think maybe St. Louis, during the war. She was in Virginia during the war. She's never been in St. Louis. Perhaps... Now listen to me, both of you. I figure Bishop to send his roughnecks down here to try and bluff these people off. Which means you figured just about right. Friend of yours? Uh-uh, you's two stay here. Last thing we need is for him to recognize you. Come on, Purcell. Howdy, Bannon. Judson. Get 'em around. I want 'em all to hear. Come on everybody, over here. You'll come over, Mr. Bannon wants to talk to ya. Will! Will! If you're here to run us of, Bannon... No such thing. I owe these people too much for that. All right. Here it is. This is private land. You've all been told that, but you don't believe it. Said he wasn't tryin' to run us off. I'm not. I'm here to get you to leave peacefully. And what if we don't? Hardy Bishop, he has 20 men to see that you do. One way or another. Why don't you clear off, Bannon! Yeah, bring your 20, we'll show you a match for 'em. Wait a minute, we don't want to fight with these boys. Look. Look, I know how you feel, havin' to leave when you thought you had homes. If it were my land... But it's not. And I am grateful to you for saving my life. We ain't likely to make the same mistake twice. Aah, what're we even listenin' to him for? Oh, who's listenin'. Maybe I can make your goin' easier. You can take all the game you want, at least enough to last you till California. Could probably use a few good milk cows, a couple of bulls, maybe. Start your own herd in the spring. You're low on ammunition, so we can help you out there. And I'll see what we can do about flour and lard. Now you'll have to cut North to make the Humboldt. It's a pretty tricky stretch, but don't worry about it, I'll trail you there myself. From there on, you're on your own. Well, that's it. Milk cows, you hear that? We could start our own herd! Aw, you can swallow that swill if you wanna, but I ain't gonna! I say he's lyin'! Nobody's lying. Of course, he's lying! Wait a minute, Harper. I'm talkin' to these people. Let 'em make up their own minds for once. Why should Bishop give you anything, Bannon? Why you? He's never given anything to anybody in his whole life. Mort, who said that we was takin' anything? You don't have to decide now. Think about it. Bulls and cows, Mort! The kids ain't seen much milk. All right, go ahead, take it! Take his deal! That's what he wants to scare you off your land. Giving you a lot of empty promises he never intends keeping! That makes no sense! It does to me! I say Harper's right. Well, maybe he is and maybe he ain't. All right, now listen to me, all of you. Have I failed you yet? No. Now answer me truthfully... Did I trail you across, get you out here to this land, good land for your homes, a greater land than you ever dreamed of. Yeah, but I think that you're forgettin' Mr. Bannon... Let him go on. Now when your very lives depend on it you begin to doubt me. Well, I mean what am I gonna say? Doubt me against Cap here, or maybe Judson, yes. But certainly not against this saddle-trash. Yeah, that's right, you heard me. Saddle-trash. Now there's one for you. Look at him, look at his hand just itchin' to go for that gun. Don't worry, he won't go for it not right now he won't. He'll wait till some dark night, then he'll come sneakin' in on his belly like a snake. Mama! Mama! Oh, how did he get to do that? Mama! Take care of her, please, ma'am. Take it easy. Get him out of here, quick! He's gettin' away! Somebody gimme a gun! Hold it! That's what you can expect from Bishop, killing and brutality. He's wrong. Can't hold 'em back much longer, it'll take just one to start it. All right, back off. Hold your fire, men! Hold it! Hold your fire! You can't stop 'em! Don't anyone follow 'em. They'll double back and pick you off one at time, you'll never know what hit ya. Now the first thing we have to do is to get these wagons in a circle. Mr. Harper, I'd say the first thing was to give Mrs. Judson, there, a proper burial. You're right, Cap. Get your bible. Bannon! How is he? Bad. Can you get him back? Not on horseback, he is bleeding too much. Better go back to the ranch and get a buckboard. You stay here with Red. Where are you going? When Bishop sees that kid, I figure I got till just then to get those people out of here. Are you crazy, Ned? How close you think you will get after Red killed that woman. Red didn't kill her. But I seen him! What you saw was Red firing and the woman falling down. But there was something else. What? A bullet hole in her back. Did you see it? It was about the size of your finger. But when they turned her over, there was a hole big enough to put your fist in. It takes a special kind of bullet to make a hole like that and Red wasn't carrying it. It's a ripping thing, Stark. Hollow-nosed and split in the end. And when they hit, they expand, just flatten out. You put one in the right place, they'll blow half your guts out. But why would anyone want to shoot that woman? To make 'em think it was us. To fill 'em so full of hate and bitterness, that nothin' short of war would run 'em outta here. Them bullets. Who'd use a thing like that? I can think of a couple who might, and one who has, that bushwhacker who put one in me. "Thou preparest a table before me "in the presence of mine enemies. "Thou annointest my head with oil. "My cup runneth over. "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me "all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." Amen. A nice funeral? Where's Barrett? Plenty tears? Much prayin'? I said, where's Barrett? With his horse. A loose shoe. And where's yours? All right, you ride. Without food? I would not do that to an animal. Get him some food. You can eat it on the way. Barrett will follow as soon as he's done with his horse. Now how long will it take you to get to your men? An hour. And from there to Bishop's ranch? An hour. Now I don't know when Bishop is coming out. He may wait till dawn. But I have an idea when he sees the job I did on the puncher of his, it'll be tonight. Then we go in, huh? When he rides out we go in. No. You post a lookout first. Use Barrett. And you? What you do when this pot is on the fire? Don't worry about me. I'll keep the pot boiling from this end. From the looks of things it shouldn't be too hard. They look mean enough to start their own war. Jerky! Best I could do. Dried beef is small payment, what I am to do. You bring this off right, mi amigo, and tomorrow night you'll have fresh beef. Buena suerte. Hey? St. Louis! What? Who's that? Yeah, sure. St. Louis. First I think maybe it is curiosity, but then I remember. I don't know you. I don't know what you're talking about. You know. Maybe you fool these farmers, this Harper, si. But you cannot fool Zarata! I never saw you before in my life. No. But I see you. During the war in that stinking dump you gin around in. Si, but you are right about one thing, you do not see Zarata. No. All you see are those officers, those fancy ranchers who come peacocking about, their pockets full of silver! You and your fancy feathers! You're wrong. You're wrong, it isn't that way at all. How cruel of me to think so. You don't understand. It was in another world. You are wrong to run from me. After all, consider really, am I so different from those officers? Please. Drop that knife! I said drop it! Turn around! Hold on to this. You don't much care how you do it, do you? Kill 'em with thirst, knife 'em, or blast 'em with one of these bullets. It makes a difference? Only when you miss. A luxury I cannot afford too often. What was it? Shootin'. From the stream, sounds like. Who's down there? The stream? Mama! Mama! Get that boy back here! Cap, who's down there with Ellen? Anyone? Let me go! You wanted water, amigo. Drink! Drink! Don't let him go! Come back here! Stop that kid! Come back here you fools! His ma, she's down there by the stream. And so is Bishop, for all you know. That's what he wants to do. Draw you out, get you down there. Now get back in here. Keep him covered, Ellen. If he moves, shoot him! Mama! Mama! Don't move! Let him go. Coax me. Give me that rifle. I warn you. I said give it to me. One more inch and I kill the boy. Your rifle, your bullets, you know what they can do. Now let him go. The boy dies! So do you. Will! Will! Bishop or no, that woman and kid's out there! Stay with the wagons! Make 'em come to you! Let me go! Hey, hey, it's one of them miners. Bannon. Down by the stream. Tried to jump the woman. I tried to stop him. And Barrett? Dead. Bannon killed him. D'ya hear that? Yankee scum! Anyone else with him? No one. He's alone. Go get him. Will! He's hurt! Oww! His arm's probably broken. Will, Will. Be a lot worse if we don't get out of here. What are you doing? We've got to get to those horses. Yonder's the boy! There he is! He's got the kid! He's gettin' away! Shoot him! No, no! You'll hit the kid! Where's Bishop? Bunk house. With Red? How is he? I take the boy. Careful of that arm, it may be busted. It's a pretty good splint. Better fix a new one. You go with Charley. He'll take care of Will and give you something to eat. Thanks. We tried it your way, didn't we? Now we'll try it mine. Stark. Chavez. How many men we got, Stark? Fifteen, sixteen. Where're the others? Out on the range. Saddle them up then. Murray, Hall... No, I want Murray with me. Sam and Hall stay here with Charley, the rest go. You said three days. Hear me? Yes, sir. Chavez, break out them rifles. The new ones. Pass 'em out as far as they go. All right. Look, Hardy, you said three days. You gave your word, that must mean something. Not when it cost me one of my men. Well, you go up there bent on killing and probably lose... No handful of settlers I can take care of. ...lose five or six... But it's not a handful, not anymore it isn't. What are you talking about? You can guess. Them rustlers? You're in a war, Hardy. A bigger war than you've ever been in before, but it's not with them settlers. Yellow-livered, cattle steal... So they're in this too, huh? But who you want is Harper. Why hanged if it ain't shaping up into a pretty fair fight. Hurry 'em up, Stark. Look, let me go up there and tell them they have to give up Harper. No, by thunder, they're part of it! Made themselves part when they shot that boy. But that was Harper! It's the same thing. They ain't no different. You think so? Come in here, I want to show you something. If you gotta yelp, boy, yelp. Bust a gut holdin' it in. Men don't cry. Oh? I always figured men do cry. Real men. Only the greenhorns who aren't sure they're men, they're the ones that worry about it. It hurts. What is this? The boy's name is Will. That's his mother, Ellen. Take a look at 'em Hardy, a good look, real close. No different from Harper and those cattle thieves, is that what you said? They're on my land. Is that all you've got to say? They're on my land! You're land! You talk about it like it was something holy? It is for me. When are you going to learn, Hardy. Without people it's nothing! People are what make it worth something. Aah, don't talk to me about people. Ain't one I'd pay a sack o' sheep dung for. You don't believe that. I built my life believin' it. Now get these people outta my sight, and you with 'em. So you really mean it. You're really gonna go up there and chop 'em up. That's exactly what I'm going to do. Well, then you're going to have to chop me up, too, be right up there with 'em. That suits me fine. Get the boy's clothes. Why do you hate us? What did we do wrong? Will. Wait! You say Harper's the one, not these people. You say he shot Red? You can get them to turn him over to me? Knowing what I do. You can make them leave, clear off my land, without no more killing? I think so. What if there is killing? Then it's your way. My way. I used to know what that was. I used to have a right, clear notion. Ma'am, the boy could use some sleep. Oh, yes, yes, thanks. He's so tired. It's the first real bed he's slept in in a month. You go out for a while. I'll stay with him until you turn in. You don't have to do that. Well, he may want something. I just don't understand... Ma'am? Bishop. Giving up his room like this! He seemed so cruel, so rough. He's rough. So determined to hate people. Then to do a thing like this. He don't hate people, ma'am, not really. He's just afraid of loving 'em, that's all. You're a wise man, Charley. No ma'am. Just Indian. Boy all right? Yes. Do you think there's anything you can do? About Harper, I mean. Maybe. Not much without some sleep though. Good night. It was those things you heard about me back at the stream, wasn't it? Forget it. I didn't believe a word. You believed it. Why shouldn't you? Most of it was true. You don't have to admit that, not to me. I admit it. There was a war, people did a lot of things. Oh, not the war. War made it easy. But you lost your husband. You said so yourself. Your home. There was no home. And I never had a husband. It's not a very pretty picture, is it? Neither was the world I grew up in. Some people survived it. The strong ones, maybe. But I wasn't strong. I was weak. It's a funny thing about strength. I don't think it's something you're born with. I'm not even sure that it's something you can be taught. I think it's something you have to learn for yourself through a terrible hurt. The boy? Only not the way you think. I wanted that baby. More than anything else in the world, I wanted it. It was like... Well, it was like the only pure thing I'd ever owned. The one thing in my life that was going to be clean and... Well, that story about my husband didn't always work. Sometimes there were people I'd known before. And the boy was getting old enough to be hurt by what was being said about him. That's when I got strength. Enough strength to look for a new life. A good life. Why are you telling me this? You don't know, do you? Get down! Gunfire. It was a gunshot. I heard it. Keep away from those windows, Porter, get away from that door! He's shot! Keep clear of those windows, all of you! Put out that lamp! Get the boy. Anything? No. Where do you think they are? Firing came from above the corral. Where's Bishop? The barn. The others, the bunkhouse? Yeah. That'll be what they're tryin to cover, then. Here. Stay where you are. Barricade what you can. Now son, you stay right here and don't you move. Get it against the door. Yeah. And get the rifles. Man, I can't see nothin' out there! If it was only out there, out in the open. Well, I ain't about to wait till it's light, I can tell ya. Not when they can pick me off like they did Porter. I'm with ya, let's get em. Stay where you are. Who else is with me? You can count on me. I'm warnin' ya, you won't get two steps out that door. Warnin'? What are you gonna do, Stark? Shoot us? Look, we'll head high, see. Across the corral. We'll try to make it to the barn, and when we draw their fire you come out. Come on. Sort of been waiting for you. How did you make it? Cut across back of the bunkhouse. No problems? One. I think he was the only one there. Sounds like they got a bunch of 'em. They been workin' over the bunkhouse, makin' a coffin out of it. How many you figure? Maybe a dozen. That all? That's all they had unless they got some of the settlers. Yeah, sitting pretty, ain't they? Waiting for us to show ourselves and pickin' us off when we do. If only we could think of a way to get those boys out of the bunkhouse. Well, you better think fast, it's gonna be light in a couple o'... Hey, wait a minute. You got any water in here? There's a barrel of it over there. Why? Get some straw. What? Straw? What for? Wet it, and put it in the wagon. What're you gonna do? Build a fire. Fire? With wet straw? Best kind. Ever see one? Sure. Smokes like the... Smokes like the devil. Come on. Still can't see nothin'. Don't let it gall you, Sam. They can see you. There is four dead men to prove it. Well, it's a Mexican standoff so far, we can't get out, they can't get it. Man, if this works... Yeah, you'll never touch the stuff again. Hey, look! Somethin' in the barn. Hanged if it ain't a light. All right, come on! Now! The house! Get the house! Now! Drop 'em! Will! Will! Drop it, Bannon! Keep those hands high! Let them go, Harper. It's between you and me now. Not a chance, Bannon. They're my ticket out of here. Now you get out there and get a couple of horses and bring 'em around back, quick. Go on, Bannon, before I... Before you what? Start throwin' more lead around? I've got plenty left. I wonder. Fact is, I wonder if you've got any left. Don't, don't press me, Bannon. I'm not pressin' anything. I'm just trying to figure it. I'd be a fool to take orders from a man with an empty gun, now wouldn't I? Are you going to get those horses? There's been a lot of shooting, Harper, you've done your share. Let's see... You shot three times at me, that leaves three. Can you remember 'em? You ought to be able to remember three shots. Charley! Ned! Ned, they found Hardy! What do you mean "found"? In the barn. You better come quick. I'll take care of Charley. Take your tamale-pickin' paws off me. Pokin' around in a man's insides, ain't nothing sacred? Ah. I got him for ya. Pretty ain't he? Fancy spurs and all. Stop pokin', I told ya. If you really want to do somethin' to earn your keep, go get me my whiskey. But it is all gone. I know that's empty. Look in the feed bin. Bring me what you find there. Charley didn't know about that one. You talk too much. Ah, I learned it from you. Nothin' but... Nothin' but talk. That's all you were ever good for. You ought to rest, Mr. Bishop. Man, what a barn-burner. Yeah, but we put on a show for 'em, didn't we? Hanged if we didn't. Nothing like it since '52. Right, Stark? Yes, sir. Here! Gimme that. He's gonna die. Die? Me? Ha, wouldn't that be somethin' to see. Judson. Bannon. We heard about Bishop gettin' killed. We're sorry. Thanks. Where you folks going? North, to the Humboldt, then West. Like we should've done in the first place. If we'd listened to you instead of Harper we'd have prevented a lot of trouble. And killin'. Maybe Harper was right about one thing though. Maybe you folks should stay in this valley, all of you. I want you to stay. After what we've done? All you've done, any of you, is try and find a place to belong. I'd like to belong here, it's a great land. It's just land now. What it needs is people to make it great. I hope you'll stay. Folks, did you hear what Mr. Bannon said? He said he wants us to stay here. She's gone. She and the boy. Where? Up North. Toward the Humboldt, I guess. Thanks.
