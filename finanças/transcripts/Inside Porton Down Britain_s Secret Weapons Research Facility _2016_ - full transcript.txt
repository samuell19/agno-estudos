©AMC.Karl63 This is CS gas. It's designed to hurt, not kill. It's one of the few chemical weapons I can be exposed to and survive. When you are happy, take your mask off and remove your respirator. Open your eyes. OK. OK, what's your name? Michael... Oh, God! Ah! COUGHING AND SPLUTTERING Jesus! COUGHING GASPING Don't rub your eyes, Michael, you will make it worse. How, really...? Oh, Jesus! I generally thought it was going to be quite mild, whereas... I can see why they use it in those situations. You cannot... ..stay there. CS gas is one of the many chemical weapons developed at Britain's top-secret military research base, which this year celebrates its 100th anniversary. We've been given unprecedented access to Porton Down and to research being done in secure laboratories. Biological and chemical weapons. There's enough there to kill hundreds of thousands of people. Their impact is unbounded. This is research that is aimed at protecting British military, but also civilians, from terrorist attack. But Porton Down also have their dark secrets. The only thought that the government had was let's hush it up. It's about keeping this nation safe and some of that we need to keep secret to make sure we stay ahead of the people who would do us harm. This is the most secret, controversial and misunderstood scientific and military institution in the UK. CAR RADIO: "Porton Down has long been the home to the most sensitive "work in defence, but now it's being prepared to..." I'm Dr Michael Mosley and I've seen close-up what happens to soldiers and civilians on the front line, which is why I'm particularly fascinated by Porton Down, also known as the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, where so much secret British military research takes place. I'm actually getting a little tingle of excitement at the thought of going in. Porton Down has been described as the most secret place in Britain. It is, therefore, a huge privilege and thrill, I have to say, being allowed into it. I'll be very curious to see what they actually show us and, to some extent, what they don't show us. Pass. Thanks. Thank you very much. Hi there. Hi, Michael. Hello. Nice to see you. Nice to meet you. Thank you. Let me show you around. Many people may have heard of Porton Down, but many more will have no idea what really goes on in here. I'm certainly hoping to find out. Hello. Right. Magical mystery tour. Let's go. Do you do many guided tours for journalists? Not for journalists. It does have quite a reputation as a site. In what way? Historically, there's so many aliens and so many everything else that's supposed to be here. So, what have we got? We've got... what on my left? Well, the large white building you've got there is the first permanent building that was ever built on the site and that was built in 1918 by the Royal Engineers. OK. So what is the blue building over there? Our current headquarters. It seems to have quite a lot of security outside, doesn't it? A lot of police, a lot of physical security and a lot of electronic security. Has there ever been a breach? Not into any of the sensitive areas that we have. Security is very tight and has affected the way we make this film. What's that sort of industrial thing over there? Sorry, I can't give you any details on that. We can't show many buildings. We can't fully identify the staff or even reveal their exact roles. There's one quite strange-looking building over there. That one stands out. That's one of the buildings that we don't discuss. And in looking at it, you have no idea what is going on inside them. Well, that's the idea. There are plenty of forms of technology that are looking at this site. Suitably anonymous. Some of it is a strange old mixture of slightly dilapidated-looking stuff over there and brand-new-looking stuff over there. The site permanently evolves because the threat to the UK, to defence, is permanently evolving. Today, the military needs to respond to a barrage of new and unfamiliar threats - rogue nations, terrorists, asymmetric warfare. The man running Porton Down is Jonathan Lyle. He is the only member of staff we can fully identify. He manages 3,000 scientists and their £0.5 billion annual budget. And it's really important that we anticipate future technologies, making sure that we are ahead of the game in terms of scientific advances that could give our armed forces an advantage. And, you know, we were formed 100 years ago this year to respond to the threat of chemical weapons that had emerged in the First World War and I'm very proud of 100 years of doing that here today. Spring, 1915. A year into the war the Germans used a new weapon, a chemical weapon, chlorine gas. With no idea what it was, the soldiers inhaled the deadly cloud. It reacted with water in their lungs, producing hydrochloric acid. The burns caused suffocation and death. In that first attack, over 800 died. A new terror spread across the Western Front. Britain's Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, demanded an immediate response. The result was a new laboratory, away from prying eyes, in the heart of rural England. They called it the War Department Experimental Ground. Porton. It rapidly became like a mini town. There were carpenters, plumbers, even a blacksmith. Over there, there were some chemical laboratories and over there were huts where they stored animals for experiments. And this, the HQ, was the first permanent building. The Germans had come up with this new, very potent weapon, so there was a real pressure on Porton to get to grips with what exactly this new weapon was, how it worked, how it could be used as a weapon and how they could defend against it. Porton Down's priority was to develop their own chemical weapons to retaliate. From the moment Britain is developing a chemical warfare capability you see officials stating that they only can get an understanding of defensive operation by doing, actually, also offensive research. They tested the new weapons in their own back yard, a 7,000-acre firing range. Down there in the bowl they would have had canisters full of poison gas and they would be released either by a timer or perhaps by somebody sort of opening it up. They also filled shells with poison gas and fired them from Battery Hill over there, up that way towards the target. Now, many of those shells actually failed to explode, which means that the hills around here are riddled with shells which still contain active agent. Part of that legacy lies behind these gates at a classified location within Porton Down's range. Thousands of unexploded chemical weapons. Some are from Porton. Some were collected from other old firing ranges. Mark is responsible for destroying these shells. Wow. These things look... Wow. This is our main storage area here and these contain a chemical called stannic chloride. OK. Blimey. Go in here. And what would these contain? They would contain either phosgene or mustard. Really? You see, the most common gas we get is mustard gas. Yeah. And second to that is bromobenzyl cyanide. Those are the two most common ones, but we also have gases such as chlorine, phosgene and hydrogen cyanide. Many of these chemicals kill by interfering with the uptake of oxygen in the lungs or in the blood. Many are still as deadly as the day they were made. Just to show you stuff that has come in recently. So this is stuff that we've recovered from a beach. Blimey. They are former chemical shells. All of this came from a beach? Yes. Can you tell me where? I can't. Right. OK. I kind of suspected you might say that. And what would that contain? Those, mustard or bromobenzyl cyanide. Right. All of them are extremely poisonous and this is the only place in the UK licensed to destroy this stuff. I'm going to follow one shell on its journey to destruction. They begin by using powerful X-rays to look inside. SIREN BEEPS We can clearly see the liquid level here. So this is the liquid level. The reason we do it at an angle is so we can depict that it is a liquid level cos if we did it upright you couldn't tell whether it's a solid or a liquid. Right. Next, they need to identify exactly what is in the shell using a neutron beam. Chemical weapons each have their own unique atomic signature. ©AMC.Karl63 This is the neutron activation analysis result. As we can see on here, we've got the various elements that come up and that's high confidence that those elements are present within the shell. Right. So that immediately tells us that we have mustard gas in it. Mustard gas is one of the most infamous chemical agents of all time. This shell will now continue its journey to destruction. To find out more about mustard gas I'm going to a part of Porton Down where cameras have never been before. Now, this is very unusual because we are in a high-security part of Porton Down, which is where they make some of the CWAs, the chemical warfare agents. In fact, we're about to see it happen. Only a small handful of scientists are allowed to make them and only then for specific research purposes. Marcus is one of them. Hello. I'd better not... Do I shake your hand? Hi, there. Nice to meet you. Welcome to two-five. Hi, there. Right. A big skull and crossbones on that one. That's right, yeah, we keep them in these, what we call toxic carriers and inside we've got the mustard itself. 'Those who've inhaled it describe it as smelling like mustard or garlic.' It's frozen, look. So, at 14 degrees it freezes and just becomes like ice. And that's what it looks like. So it was one of the real things that people feared. Again, the First World War, presumably now, since it's still being used, and was that because it kind of hung around for a long time? Yeah, it's one of the more persistent of the agents but it's more because, you know, you get it on your skin and it slowly sort of works its way in and then gives you these huge debilitating blisters. Incredibly painful, but it doesn't kill you. Unless we get it right down into your lungs you are likely to survive if you get mustard on your skin, yeah. But just horrifically painful? Horrifically painful, big blisters, no real treatment for these things. Now, this is an atlas of gas poisoning and it was distributed by the British government to doctors on the front line to let them know just what they were facing. These images paint a shocking picture of the horror of mustard gas. He actually was very unlucky because he just sat on ground which had been contaminated by poison gas and it managed to seep through his clothing and onto his buttocks, and you can see, here, they are all red, they are blistered. This must have been incredibly painful but he made a full recovery. There's a painting here, gangrene of the foot. This is caused by chlorine poisoning and this guy actually survived, but a couple of his toes went black, shrivelled and had to be removed. And finally, we have another picture here, and it's obviously postmortem, and it shows his trachea, and you can see it's horrible, it's red, it's inflamed and it's just full of pus. And this guy almost certainly sort of drowned in his own... Yeah. A terrible, terrible way to go. "If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood "Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, "Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud "Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, "My friend, you would not tell with such high zest "To children ardent for some desperate glory, "The old Lie; Dulce et Decorum est "Pro patria mori." In response to the deadly gas attacks and the fear they created, Porton Down's scientists began developing masks to protect the troops. So this is where it all begins, is it? 'Colin manages today's respirator technology, 'which has come a long way from the Black Veil.' It doesn't look very effective. What would this have been impregnated with? That would have been impregnated with sodium thiosulphate, washing soda or sodium carbonate and glycerin. So that would've reacted chemically with the chlorine. And would that have worked at all? It would have been better than nothing. It would probably provide some sort of escape capability to the wearer, but... So that was the very first response. And this one is obviously pretty early as well. Yeah, this was round about 1916. There were various variants of the hood-type respirator. Again, it is a fabric impregnated with chemical. Would this have protected you against chlorine? It would have provided protection against chlorine and this particular version would have provided protection against phosgene as well. What sort of period is this? This is probably about 1916, 1917. This is the light-type respirator. Now you are starting to see something that resembles a respirator of today. It's got a rudimentary face piece, but importantly now, we have an activated carbon filter. This black stuff here? Yeah. The absorptive properties of activated carbon have been known for millennia. So by this point you've got something which is really quite good. Yeah. It's a far cry from the first response. Gas, gas, gas. Gas, gas, gas. Gas, gas, gas. Because of the very real threat of being attacked by chemical agents, modern soldiers are still trained in how to respond. This is the latest in a long line of gas mask technology. It is the general service respirator, the GSR. At Porton Down, we are putting it through its paces. All this testing equipment is designed to find out if the mask leaks. How heavy is this one? It's about 12 kilos. Not that heavy by soldier standards. OK. This mist looks really nasty, but it is actually a harmless oil-based aerosol. My exercises are designed to reflect real battlefield movements - crawling, running, digging. Sensors monitor the quality of the air I am breathing because in a real chemical attack even the slightest leak could be fatal. Thanks. Phew. Bits coming off. Right. Ooh, God. That was quite close to phobia, I must admit. And it's also very weird being in there with all that, sort of, smoke and particles, but I guess the next thing to do is find out whether this thing actually protected me. So, how did I do? Well, as expected, Michael, you got excellent results. OK. You can see very, very low levels of ingress within the respirator. Reassuring, I guess, that it worked. And under real conditions you can see you've got excellent results. Because there's one thing putting it on in the lab-type situation and there's another, kind of, actually running around with it. That's right. Back in the classified area within Porton's range, the shell containing mustard is ready to be destroyed. They are now in a sealed chamber, effectively a large lab there, and the shell has been deep frozen so the agent inside it, the chemical agent, is now definitely solid and in a moment they're going to take it over there and they're going to chop it in half, separating out the explosive bit from the chemical agent bit. There it goes. Opening the shell demands great care and precision. Cutting too high could detonate it. Once the saw is set, the team is evacuated to 100 metres away. So this is all remote controlled. Yes, a remote controlled bandsaw. And our aim is to separate the explosive component with the agent. Cutting... Now. I can see the steam coming off now. That's the agent... Right, OK. So that is actually mustard gas, mustard liquid, coming out, is it? You can actually see the agent itself around the roller bearings. There's a nice pool. You wouldn't want to be in that room. No. Will it sort of evaporate off, or just hang around there? No, it'll hang around there for a considerable amount of time. OK. We're nearly through now. There you go. It's stopped. Power off. Just to confirm, four vials... Roger. The mustard is still highly toxic, poisoning the air inside the laboratory. With the detonator removed, the mustard gas can finally be destroyed. It's incinerated at over 800 degrees for 24 hours. This is painfully slow work and there are thousands of unexploded shells waiting to be destroyed. And more being found every year. Removing the legacy of Britain's chemical weapons could take a generation. In 1925, the major world powers signed the Geneva Protocol, which banned the use of chemical weapons in warfare. But surprisingly, it didn't ban their development. During the Second World War, the British military became convinced that Hitler was about to renege on the Geneva Protocol and unleash chemical weapons. To keep ahead, in 1942, Porton Down started their own secret project to produce a completely different type of weapon. A weapon that harnessed nature. Not chemical, but biological. Biological weapons are live organisms. Biological weapons can replicate themselves. If you're using an infectious disease, once you've infected a certain part of the population, that would then spread on its own. Their potential impact is unbounded. This is Gruinard Island. During the war, it was the unlikely location of Porton Down's new biological weapons testing programme. It would be the West's first weapon of mass destruction. 'It was here in 1942 that the very first scientifically 'controlled BW field trials were carried out. 'Sheep were used for the trials.' Morning. Very good, thanks. The island sits in a wide bay, far from any centre of population on the north-west coast of Scotland. It was the perfect place for Porton scientists to secretly test their new weapon. To do their tests, they needed a bleak, isolated island, some animals to experiment on, and a suitably lethal microbe. The microbe they used was Bacillus anthracis, anthrax. It causes severe and often fatal respiratory collapse. And it's persistent. Its spores can lie dormant in soil for decades. After Porton had done their experiments, the island had to be quarantined for 40 years, before it was finally cleaned up. This is a bleak place, isn't it? The plan was to build an anthrax bomb and test its effectiveness on sheep. The bacterium that causes anthrax is a very hardy little organism. It forms a spore, which protects it against high temperatures and extreme environments. But how do you turn the spore into a weapon? This is an aerosol. Tiny drops of liquid in air. And if I play them by this machine, you can see they are absolutely tiny. One to three microns across. Which means there are probably about a 30th of the width of a human hair. The thing is that because they are so small, if there were spores inside there, they would go deep inside the lungs. It also means that they can travel considerable distances. The challenge was to suspend anthrax in an aerosol. 'The sheep are being put into exposure crates 'to ensure that it faces the cloud.' I'm going to recreate part of their experiment, using a harmless cloud. 'The bomb is fired and the wind carries the cloud towards 'the line of animals and impingers.' Downwind, a particle counter measures the concentration of the aerosol. Can you imagine sort of sheep tethered here, having no idea what's about to hit them? The anthrax spores just spreading out. And the particles are going to hit me now. Yep, there they go, shooting up. We're now at 40,000, 68,000. In the original experiment, every particle would contain some spores. And they would have started to breathe in, the spores would have gone deep into their lungs. It's actually very, very chilling when you see it and you can imagine the scientists over there and the sheep here. The experiment worked. In fact, the results were even better than they had dared hope. 'On the third day after exposure, the casualties begin. 'Dead sheep can be seen further down the line. 'They show conclusively that bacteria could be put 'up by a simple weapon and that the results might be much more 'striking than with a chemical filling. 'This was, of course, something that had never been demonstrated before.' Although in World War I, chemical weapons were often deadly, many like mustard injured more than they killed. Anthrax was different. It had the potential to produce massive fatalities. An anthrax bomb went into production. Thankfully, Britain never had to use it. Which turned out to be a wise decision. As the war ended, the Allies discovered that Nazi scientists had perfected a new type of chemical weapon. A nerve agent called sarin. A colourless, odourless liquid. Lethal in even the tiniest amounts. In this harrowing footage from Sweden, a rabbit is given a lethal dose of sarin. 'This is an authentic laboratory record. 'The effects would be the same in man. 'The pupils shrink, the eyes and nose run, the mouth drools. 'The chest is tight and the heart slows down.' Inside one of Porton Down's most secure laboratories, I'm about to encounter the Nazis' most infamous nerve agent. That's a crude version, so that's impure sarin. And that is what pure sarin looks like. Really? Don't get too close. I'm being told not to get too close. You can put your hands on here. I'm a bit enthusiastic. Don't get close. Thank you very much, yeah. Now, this is very different to anything that I've seen before because this is sarin, which is a hugely notorious liquid. It's actually a nerve agent. Nasty symptoms associated with it. This really is very, very evil stuff. Now, your nerves are a bit like an electrical system. What would normally happen is you stub your toe, for example, the signal goes down the wires to a synapse, represented by the bell. BELL RINGS Then, the nerves release a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, which carries the signal across the synapse to the brain, saying "pain". And then your body produces an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase and switches the whole thing off, stopping it continuously firing. What sarin and other nerve agents do is they prevent the enzyme from breaking down the neurotransmitter. And your nerves are just switched on all the time. The result is complete and utter chaos. You can't breathe properly because you can't control your in and your out and you asphyxiate. You lose control of your bowels, you lose control of your bladder, you basically urinate, you defecate, and you die very, very badly. One Porton official once described the one moment where we had been found with our trousers down and that was nerve gas. They had not anticipated this type of agent. It was extremely toxic. It was fast acting. And it was able to be used in different types of environment, from ground contamination through to inhalation. So it had multiple ways of being applied in combat. 'Muscles go into uncontrollable spasm. 'Breathing is paralysed and death follows.' Close down Porton Down! Close it down! Animal testing has always been a key part of the work at Porton Down and a matter of increasing public concern. Animal research. Clearly, a lot of animals have passed through Porton Down. Yeah. What are your thoughts about it? I would start by saying that we use animals in experiments for a purpose and that is to give our armed forces the protection that they need. We do it in a very regulated environment, so we are regulated under the relevant legislation that has been passed by parliament and we are regulated by Home Office inspectors who have their own passes and can come here at any time, as they do, to examine the welfare of our animals and what we do. And lastly, we've done a lot in the last decade, under the three Rs - replacement, refinement, and reduction - to reduce the number of animals that we use. In the 1950s, sarin experiments on animals couldn't give Porton Down scientists all the answers they wanted. The pressures of the Cold War led to the intensification of a particularly controversial type of experiment - the use of chemical agents on human volunteers. At its height, they carried out over 500 human experiments a year. Then, in May 1953, something happened that cast a very long shadow over Porton Down. An RAF volunteer called Ronald Maddison took part in an experiment involving sarin. He went into the gas chamber. A little while later, he says he feels sick. He then collapses. They frantically try to revive him, but in fact, he had died at 11am that day, 45 minutes after going in to... After being tested with nerve gas. Maddison's death was a huge shock to people at Porton Down, but no-one was prepared to take responsibility. Instead, his cause of death was covered up. The death of Ronald Maddison was one of the biggest cover-ups of the Cold War. In that classic way of how British government works, this tragedy happened and the only thought that the government had was, let's hush it up, which they did do successfully for decades. One of the darkest periods in the history of Porton Down is the death of a young volunteer in 1953 and it wasn't so much his death, as the fact that the events around it were kept secret for such a long time. Can you explain to me why it was considered necessary to do that? Well, as you say, that was the 1950s, a very long time ago, and the British government has acknowledged that things were not done well. Can you explain to me the thinking behind it? What were they thinking? Do they think - we can just keep this thing buried for a very long time? I can't answer for people of that time. All I can say is the British government has acknowledged that mistakes were made and all I can say is that the laboratory that I lead today operates to the very highest scientific and ethical standards. In 2004, and after 50 years of campaigning, Maddison's family finally got a new inquest. My family has never known the truth and why he had to die so young. We are grateful to the coroner for holding the inquest so that we can finally know the truth. The inquest declared that Ronald Maddison was unlawfully killed. But it took two more years for the MoD to accept the verdict. You understand that people are sometimes a bit cynical about claims of transparency, granted the history? But it was a very long time ago. OK. So you're saying it couldn't happen now? The standards we operate to are the very highest. We had lots of scrutiny and we certainly don't do any experiments of the character that led to that regrettable death in 1953. Ronald Maddison's death came just as the Cold War was intensifying. Porton Down accelerated their chemical weapons programme on an industrial scale. They developed a new nerve agent, up to 170 times more potent than sarin. Venomous agent X. VX. Now, it is a nerve agent that is far more powerful than sarin. Marcus is making some at the moment. For obvious reasons, we're not going to dwell on the process. Porton Down originally developed VX from an industrial pesticide, which was banned when chemists realised just how lethal it was. What does VX do? It's a nerve agent. It acts in exactly the same way as sarin, but it's incredibly toxic. Much more toxic than sarin. Wow. A pinhead drop on your skin would be enough to kill you. Why do you make it? We need to understand it and we need to be confident that all the equipment, the clothing, the detection gear, that our operators, soldiers, have got, works and is effective, should they ever, God forbid, come across something like this. Cos this part is far higher risk from the point of view of the agent coming out of containment. If we put these on, just in case, if we get it on ourselves, we can step straight into the shower in the corner and wash it off. OK. Into the shower, right. I guess that brings home the reality of how dangerous this stuff is. To distil crude VX, they use a vacuum to lower the boiling point. OK, can we clear the lab of everybody, except just Marcus and the assistant at the back. OK, so they're just applying the vacuum now. And they've asked me to get out of there, just in case. OK, ready? Sash is down. Because it's so dangerous, Marcus is only allowed to make a few millilitres. OK, good to go? That stuff is incredibly lethal. OK, I think we're good to go. OK. OK, so nothing exploded, I guess. Nothing exploded. It's got an incredibly high vacuum on it now. It's just starting to sort of come up. You can see this liquid condensing and sort of going up and going back down. Can you see that? I do. That's the pure VX, coming up. So this stuff here, this is VX. How is it different to sarin? There's probably enough there to kill tens if not hundreds of thousands of people. Blimey. It's that lethal? Yeah. Tens to thousands of people. Right. It would be horrendous. Do you find any of this sort of scary? Um... It's always in the back of your mind, how toxic it is. Yes. VX is the most potent chemical weapon ever created. It would also be the last Porton Down would ever develop. And that's because by the end of the 1950s, the British government had decided to focus its limited resources on a very different weapon of mass destruction. EXPLOSION 'Britain fires its first H bomb to join the United States 'and Russia as ranking atomic powers.' The British thermonuclear bomb meant Porton Down's offensive weapons programmes were terminated. They didn't need another weapon of mass destruction, they didn't need and biological weapons. And the worry, I think, to some extent, was that it wasn't that they were not good weapons, militarily speaking, it was they didn't want chemical and biological weapons to become a poor man's nuclear weapon. 'New work is undertaken on the development of munitions 'for the spreading of diseases. 'The research is limited to that necessary to enable 'an effective means of defence to be devised.' But other nations didn't give up any of their chemical and biological weapons programmes. GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS As the Cold War developed, Porton became concerned that the USSR might detonate a biological bomb over Britain. So, in secret, they sprayed aerosols over populated areas to try and understand the impact of such an attack. The public were never told, but the evidence suggests the aerosols were harmless. You'd have spraying out clouds that would then waft in over cities, inland, to see how biological weapons would travel, environmentally, with air currents, exposure to sunlight, all those things. 'As the cloud drifted inland, 'it was sampled by mobile sampling stations.' What Porton would say is that what they were spraying was completely harmless, but again, this was a programme that happened in complete secrecy and what Porton would argue was - of course we had to keep it secret because we didn't want to tell the Russians what we were doing. Thankfully, the Cold War ended without chemical or biological weapons being used in anger. But then, a new war began in the Middle East. 1988, Halabja, Iraq. Saddam Hussein did what even Hitler wouldn't dare. He unleashed sarin. For the first time in history, a nerve agent was used in warfare. 'These are some of the 5,000 people killed by Iraqi gas 'attacks in and near the town of Halabja. 'The children look asleep on the grass.' During the 1980s, I was actually working on the current affairs programme Newsnight and I used to sit in the basement watching some really, really horrible footage from the Iran-Iraq War, the sort of things we could never transmit. I still remember it clearly. There were so many dead people, so many dead children, who had been killed horribly by a chemical weapon. It's very disturbing, looking at these dead bodies, because they look almost as if they're asleep, but you know they actually died very, very badly. Saddam Hussein had left the Geneva Protocol in tatters. In response, the UN instigated a ban on all chemical weapons, production, stockpiles, and use. To ensure the world complied, they created the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The OPCW's role is to inspect and police all sites where chemical agents are present and that, of course, includes Porton Down. We're going to check the X-ray records. Unlike us, they can see whatever they want, anywhere, anytime. Morning. The inspection begins where the old chemical weapons are stored. First, we'll check the new findings, since last inspections. What we're doing today is actually verifying the declaration that's been made and we're doing that through a physical inventory check. And a record check. 8648. 8648, the big one. Yeah, perfect. I just want to check a few random ones. It would be politically embarrassing for the UK to actually fail a CWC inspection. We have to ensure that all the information that we give and the information that is verified by the OPCW is 100% accurate. I can see there, look. Yes. Standard mortar. 25 pounder. 8741. Perfect. So far, so good. Everything's checking out so far. Yes. Next, we would like to inspect inside. Yes. Nothing is off limits to the OPCW. We are about now to go to our incinerator site. We declare that we incinerate the agent when it comes out of the munitions and so they are just checking, essentially, that is what we've done. These are the OPCW guys. Looking at the incineration records from the HS area, so to prove that you've incinerated what we've sent down. 8054, isn't it? 8054. The UN strictly controls the amount of chemical agents that can be manufactured or stockpiled in places like this. We will show you what they look like when they come out. Their inspectors also try to ensure that none can be used for offensive purposes. But not every country complies. And terrorists, of course, are a law unto themselves. OK, as you can see here, this is the end product, post-incineration. If I can take an example of one piece here, this is...well, was a 25-pounder shell. The residue agent will have all burnt off post 800 degrees. Yup. Everything they've wanted to check, we've been able to supply the right information and the right paperwork and they've seen the ammunition and by getting a good report at the end of it shows that we're doing our jobs well. Now, ideally, this would be the end of the story. Chemical weapons being destroyed, the world saved. Unfortunately, that is not what is happening. If anything, chemical weapons are on the rise. In fact, more are being used now than at any time since the First World War. The rise began with the number of chemical and biological attacks by individuals and small groups. 'These people had been making their way to work 'when the nerve gas began to seep into the air.' Japan, 13 civilians died after an attack on a subway. The United States, a series of anthrax letters killed five people. But in 2013, an attack in Syria killed hundreds. 'Something terrible has happened in a Damascus suburb. 'It has all the signs of a massive chemical attack.' Nothing on this scale had been seen since Halabja. And as the leading chemical weapons laboratory in the world, samples came to Porton Down. Hi, there. In their secret forensic laboratory, Cerys was the scientist who had to establish what chemical agent had killed so many people. OK, so describe to me the sequence of events. So, some of the first samples we received were blood, hair, and urine. Did you know where it had come from? We knew it had come from a person who thought that they'd been exposed to some kind of chemical. OK. At that time, it wasn't clear what the chemical was. So all of the samples were extracted by different means. Got the first results within probably eight or ten hours. And then the confirmatory results across all the samples within the next 24 hours. The chemical agent that killed up to 1,500 men, women and children in Damascus was the nerve agent sarin. When you get the first results, do you call everyone else in to go - look, we've found something? With the very first set of samples, where it was the first time that we'd seen evidence of sarin exposure, we did. We kind of stood in front of the instruments, scratching our heads, because none of us had really expected to find a positive at that point. Had you searched before? No, it was the first set of samples that we'd had from the incidents in Syria. Samples in the Porton Down laboratory shows the use of chemical weapons in that Damascus suburb. Blood and hair tested positive for sarin. The scale of the attack caused international outrage. And the finger of blame seemed to point at the Syrian regime. Military action soon followed. If we fail to act, other tyrants will have no reason to think twice about acquiring poison gas and using them. And it could be easier for terrorist organisations to obtain these weapons. The war on terror has changed and broadened Porton Down's remit. What was once solely a chemical and biological weapon facility now focuses on all areas of modern warfare. Developing battlefield equipment based on quantum physics. Advanced ballistics protection. You can get a measure here of the depth into flesh there. And blast physics to protect troop carriers from IEDs. EXPLOSION The sheer magnitudes of the pressures that we're seeing, how that then interacts with an armoured vehicle, would allow me to design something that's better, stronger, in the future. We've continued to work in countering the threat of chemical weapons and then biological weapons, but today, we're about so much more than that. It's about countering the threat to our armed forces, however that is posed. Whether that is bullets, whether that's missiles, whether that's improvised explosive devices, it's about providing our armed forces with that protection. An unlikely recruit in the search for a protection is the orb web spider. Her silk is being harvested to help scientists counter a new threat. That one of the deadliest diseases known to man could be used as a weapon. So, once the spider's spun its web over the frames, then it goes into this piece of equipment, which is called a sow. And it's basically how we expose it to the virus. You can see there's a very narrow gap. So you spray some virus in here? Spray the virus, bacteria, whatever you want to spray. The aerosol passes over the frames and as the spider's web would capture dew in the morning, it will capture the aerosol particles, which will have viruses or bacteria, and we can count what's in there. The virus Porton Down are using causes one of the most contagious diseases in the world. Two years ago, in West Africa, it killed over 10,000 people. It is Ebola. You will be familiar with the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone. Of course, when something like that happens, it causes questions to be asked of - here's a pathological agent, could it be used by our adversaries, whether states or terrorists, to threaten our armed forces or the British people? To explore this potential threat, Porton Down are spraying Ebola across spiders' webs to discover just how long it remains contagious in air. Stephen leads the experiment. Why do you want to know how long these viruses will survive? Well, the main purpose is to be able to add to that broad basis of knowledge on how to control these viruses. If they should get released, we have some sort of basic understanding of how they may well transmit. So it's adding to that broad basis of knowledge that we can then add to other experiments that we do here. Now, Ebola is a particularly dangerous virus, so they don't want to run any risks at all that it might escape. That's why we're in what's called a cat four laboratory. This is as secure as it is possible to get. So far at Porton Down, I've been allowed alongside all the lethal chemical agents, but this time, I can't even get in the room. So they're just in there, wearing their wonderful space age suits. And very soon now, they're going to release the cloud of Ebola viruses. Now, I can hear what they're saying through this earpiece. I can, if necessary, talk to them. And I can see, via this camera, what they're up to. Hi there. How are you doing? Hello, yeah. We're loading up the frames with the spiders' webs on into the sow now, ready for us to turn on the aerosolisation kit and then expose the spiders' webs to Ebola. Right, we're ready to go now. Fantastic. Do you ever get nervous at this point? A little bit apprehensive, but no, we're OK. We're good to go now. OK. Right. 'OK.' All in. OK, we're going to start spraying virus in three, two, one, spray. So, hopefully, what you can see there is the aerosol nebuliser aerosolising the Ebola virus. And it's travelling down this pipe here, along these pipes and is passing by the spiders' webs, through this sow, and then back around and circulating round the machine and back out. 20 seconds left. There have been incidences in history, for example the anthrax outbreak in Washington, DC, where terrorists used a pathogen to threaten a civilian population. So, of course, we look at not just how to defend our armed forces, we look at - how could this be used by an adversary? Three, two, one. That's stopped the sampling now. After 19 minutes, more than 30% of the aerosolised Ebola still remains viable. Unfortunately, the experiment proves it could be effective as a potential weapon. Today, it's Ebola. It may well be another virus tomorrow. So, there's always going to be emerging diseases coming through. Primarily, they are going to be viruses. Which is why we've got this capability here to be able to do that sort of work. That's the work that we study and I would hope the British people would recognise that's a good thing to do, as we think about their safety and the safety of our armed forces, given that these threats are out there in the world. Looking forwards and responding to new threats is ultimately what Porton Down's scientists have done for 100 years. Over that time, they have developed weapons of mass destruction... A pinhead drop on your skin would be enough to kill you. ..using controversial methods... Close down Porton Down. ..and at times, they have hidden the truth. The only thought that the government had was - let's hush it up. Porton Down is a place of contradictions. It's a secret institution who are trying to be more open. They were born in war, but they see their primary purpose now as defensive. They have had their dark moments, but they have also saved a lot of lives. And I have no doubt that the UK would be a much more vulnerable place without them.
