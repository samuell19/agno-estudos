Timings and songs translated by Bluerain_20 And you all listen to me carefully. The party is underway. Many people have arrived. Some are yet to come. Park the vehicles in a manner which will make it easier to drive away. As soon as the car number is announced... ...the car should immediately reach the gates. You may go now. - It's you, Papa? - Why are you going in Sapna? I wasn't going to steal anything. One slap from me and you'll forget everything. Go home! Let me in for a while. Just once. I just want to see... ...how the rich look from close quarters. Stop this nonsense! You mustn't forget your status! They are our masters. And you're a mere driver's daughter! Is a driver really ordinary? You know even Lord Krishna was Arjun's driver. - Will you leave or not? - Go on and slap me! I'll count till ten. If you slap me, I'm willing to lose anything. See, you couldn't slap me. I know you can never raise your hand on me. Because I am your only daughter... ...and you love me more than any father would've loved his daughter! My love and affection have spoiled you. But please leave now. The guests are arriving. - Why are you after my job? - I'll leave right now. There's no harm in looking from a distance. - How are you? - I am fine. One should learn a lesson in loyalty from you. I remember, when Bhanu Pratap got married... ...you were here then... ...and you're still here on their 25th anniversary! A servant should be what you are. If I were to be considered a servant, I wouldn't have stayed for so long. Both of them consider me to be their family member. It takes two hands to clap. Now, one more romantic pose. Congratulations, Mr. Saigal, and to you, too! It's good that you've come. He's already had three drinks. And this is his fourth one! No restrictions for today. Today, I'll eat sweets and fried stuff too... ...and drink to my heart's content and also smoke! Because I must get some reward for putting up with you for 25 years. 'Put up' with me? On the contrary, I've put up with you. Do you know? Forget him. Forgive him for today. Let him throw caution to the winds. From tomorrow, I'll make him diet in a manner... ...which compensates for all this. Where are Vicky and Vijay? Vijay bores you to death. I never thought that a man so sporting and fun-loving... ...could have a son so dry and boring. He is a perfect workaholic. Instead of celebrating, he must be discussing business! Liquor is such a thing that it is a luxury... ...for the rich and a necessity for the poor. I am thinking of setting up such a distillery... ...which will satisfy the rich and not even harm the poor either. I am surprised at you. In spite of owning two distilleries, you don't touch liquor yourself. That's nothing new. Many of those who prepare sweetmeats, never eat them. I've heard that you're setting up a champagne factory at Nasik? You heard right. If the project is ready, my bank can finance it. It's absolutely ready. I've recorded all the details on a video cassette. Ramsingh, bring all the drinks to my room. Please be seated. I'll show you the details. This is the land where we'll set up the factory. And it's just 12 kilometers away from Nasik. Watch it. Indeed, Mr. Vijay! The project is very good. Sir, the drinks. - Tell me, who was in my room. - Mr. Vicky was here. Whenever I see a girl my crazy heart says: Ole... ole... ole... ole... ole... ole. I slowly start to sing and dance, my friend. Ole... ole... ole... ole... ole... ole. I'm attracted by youth and I enjoy my life. My heart doesn't listen to me and sways like the wind. Ole... ole... ole... ole... ole... ole. Whenever I see a girl my crazy heart says: Ole... ole... ole... ole... ole... ole. I slowly start to sing and dance, my friend. Ole... ole... ole... ole... ole... ole. Believe it or not, but I am a crazy lover. I'm a crazy lover who has been struck by desire. These fair faces and these fair arms... These naughty styles make me restless. I become restless, and I write stories in my dreams. Whenever I see a beautiful girl. Ole... ole... ole... ole... ole... ole. Whenever I see a girl my crazy heart says: Ole... ole... ole... ole... ole... ole. I'm always drowned in my colourful dreams. The house of my dreams is in my beloved's lane. I become restless whenever I see beauties. This world seems colourful to me and I lose myself in my dreams. I ask beautiful girls for a memento in order to remember them forever. The magic of beauty may opens the curtain of my eyes. Ole... ole... ole... ole... ole... ole. Whenever I see a girl my crazy heart says: Ole... ole... ole... ole... ole... ole. I slowly start to sing and dance, my friend. Ole... ole... ole... ole... ole... ole. - Keep quiet! - What did you say? Haven't we come too far today? No, because you have to jog for a couple of kilometers more. I am going to the farmhouse. We will have breakfast after I return. - Had you been born in Germany? - No, why? - Hitler too had been born there! - I see... What? Let' s leave. Stop... please stop! Take me to the Sehgal House! - What are you doing, Daddy? - I am eating. But the doctor has restrained you from eating all this, hasn't he? Yes, he has. But I have also decided today. That you will change your habit of eating on the sly? - No, I will change the doctor. - What? Yes. You are already up so early in the morning today. - Anything special? - I want money. You will get it. Get me a cigarette quickly first. - I don't have a cigarette, dad. - Never mind. Go to the bathroom. - I've already been to the bathroom. - I mean... go to my bathroom. Come on... go quickly. If the Hitler's niece arrives... ...the whole fun will be spoiled. Hurry up, go quickly! - Have you reached there? - Yes, dad. What now? Open the lid of the flush tank! After all, whose father is he? - You found a nice place! - After all, whose dad am I? Now I understand why you visit the bathroom so often. The one with the hunter has arrived! - You? You have returned very soon? - Yes, I had run very fast. I am tired. - Get me some water please. - Who's smoking cigarette here? Your son was enjoying the pleasure. You? It's a matter of great shame! If you cannot learn the right etiquette, don't. But at least learn to respect your father. Smoking cigarette in front of your father! - I have never smoked a cigarette! - Quiet, quiet! Whether you respect me or not, but don't argue with mother. Hey! Who ate the custard and porridge? Somebody has eaten the porridge? It must be some servant's handiwork. The owner of the house doesn't even taste porridge. How can the servants eat the custard and porridge? You don't have to call anybody, mother. I will tell you. I had returned late last night. I ate the custard and porridge. You returned late? You must have returned early in the morning... ...after finishing with your loafing around. I am fed up of your actions. Neither do you care for the home, nor respect elders. You are only doing as you please. Do you know... l saw his telephone diary yesterday? There are 80 names. Only of girls. What's the matter? Why are you being angry so early in the morning? I have decided. Vicky will accompany you to the office from today. Are you in your senses, mother? I will go to the office? This is my age to play and make merry. Have you heard my decision? Brother, only you can help me now. Yes, I will surely help you. I will wake you up myself, ...feed you breakfast myself, and then take you to office. - I'll be back. - Vicky, come now. Well, let's spend the day at the office today. This is your office. How is it? Very elegant. But it's still a prison for me. Because of which you've got many contacts of girls in your diary. I'm sending the Nasik Project Report to you. Study it carefully. I wish to speak to Miss Neena. The boss has asked me not to dial any girl's number for you. What? This is the Project Report. Please read it and give your remarks. - I will. Come after 5 or 7 days. - What? It's such a thick file. I need 5 to 7 days to read it! - Keep it. - Okay. Hey! This is a great place! - Yes, sir? - Listen, Chhotu. Who's the girl, sitting at the fourth desk on the right? To your right or mine? Come here, you fool! - Bend. - What, sir? Crouch, I said! Look there on the right. That's Dolly. I need a typist. Call her quickly. - What's your name? - Dolly Kapadia. - Related to Dimple Kapadia? - No such luck, Sir. What do you do? Your delicate fingers are not meant to type away on a typewriter. - What has to be typed? - Forget it. Tell me, what is your salary? - Rs.900 - This is injustice... ...taking advantage of people's helplessness. As long as I'm there, atrocities will not take place. Show me your hand. From now on, these beautiful hands will not earn Rs.900, but Rs.2,000. - It isn't less. Is it, clear? - No, sir. - You are very nice. - I'm thrilled to see you happy. Beautiful girls should always be happy. What are you doing this evening, Dolly? Sit down. When did you come from Bombay? Why didn't you tell me? First tell me what was that dance in aid of? - Have you found someone? - No. There's no one here worthy of me. Tell me, how are you doing for yourself in Bombay? How's Uncle? I'm a heroine in his film. In his ad. film, I'm a model. "If you buy a Weston TV, Happy, why won't your wife be?" What a pose you've struck! How about coming with me to work in his ad. Films? You earn both, wealth and fame. No. How can I come, leaving my father alone? Okay. But can you at least come with me... - ...or will you refuse that too? - Where are you taking me? To Hotel Clarke's in the evening. I've invited the rest too. You must have earned a lot! Yes! But of what use is it if I can't spend it on my friends? I heard that models are becoming heroines. - Yes. - If you become one... ...you'll still meet us. Won't you? She'll have to. Who else will pay heed to the heroine of a flop film? Excuse me. - We want a room. - In what name? What are you staring for? Can only one man in this world have that name? Certainly not, Sir. The letters 'C' and 'H' are repeated in the surname Bachchan, aren't they? Yes, sir. The keys! What is the matter? Why have you called me here? Your sister Dolly has gone up to the room with the boss. What nonsense are you talking? My sister and that Saigal? I'll kill him! Hurry up! You've to prove your acting. That bearded man shouldn't go up. - But what's happened? - All that later. Hurry up! You rogue, scoundrel... You dare tease me! Don't you have a sister or mother?... He teased me! Beat him up. You! You've followed me till here? Her brother's reaching here following you... ...and if he sees us here, he'll kill us. You don't know her. She has the habit of troubling people. ...and now, she's here to trouble us. I'll set her right. Set your mind right which is always obsessed with girls. - See, who's coming. - Come with me. - ...I'll show you. - Show us. It's Damo. He'll kill us! Go hide in the bathroom. Open the door! Where's that rascal who brought my sister here? Hey you! Are you crazy? Do I look like your sister? - No. - What are you doing here? Get out! Get out! Else, I'll bash you up and hand you over to the police. Trying to malign the name of a respectable man! He even teases girls. He should be taken to the police station. Yes. He should be. Someone misinformed me. Please forgive me. Go away, will you? And yes, if you've really cooled off... ...send this girl packing! If her brother returns... ...he won't ask for forgiveness this time. Got it? What would happen? He'd have got such a thrashing that... ...he would have addressed girls as 'sisters' all his life! He is sure to be beaten up. How long can he protect himself? Why is he coming back towards us? We've saved his life. He may be wanting to thank us. He may give us a lift till home. - Excuse me. - Yes? Take this Rs.100 and treat your friends to an ice-cream! Hey you! He insulted you! What does he think of himself! What a way to show his gratitude! The millionaire's son takes us to be beggars! We've done you a favor. We have saved your honor. What on earth have you given me this Rs.100 for? Is everything okay? Why are you yelling in the middle of the road? What does your brother Vicky think of himself? The girl with whom he was flirting in the hotel... ...her brother reached there and wanted to kill them. I saved his life and he handed me a Rs.100 bill!... ...saying, "eat an ice-cream!" - Do I look starved? - No. Here's this Rs.100. Give it to him and tell him that... ...my father is his servant. Not I! You're right. He shouldn't have done this. - Where are you going? - Home. I too am going home. Come, I'll drop you there. Let's go. You both are so different. You saw me and stopped the car. And he gave me a tip and sped away! What he did was wrong... ...but what he suggested was not wrong. - What suggestion? - About that ice-cream. Eating ice-cream in winter can be more fun than eating it in summer. - So, how about an ice-cream? - Sure. Get one for yourself. Can I get one? Yes... My love... If you were here with me, I would have kissed you... ...who asked you to call here? All official matters to be discussed in the office. At 9 a.m. tomorrow. Very dangerous, brother! If you don't take risks, office-work could prove to be interesting. Did you study the Nasik Project Report I sent? I was studying it, but there was an interruption. No. Dolly's brother. Sorry, brother. Some times, even the experienced make mistakes. I too made a mistake in choosing the girl. I'll take care in future. But you won't improve. You won't change yourself. I will change and improve too. When I have parents and a brother like you, let me enjoy! Okay. Enjoy yourself. Make merry to your heart's content. When you've had enough of it, come and start working in the office. - Thank you, brother! - But keep one thing in mind... ...don't ruin our family's reputation. What if mummy learns about it?... Don't worry about that. I'll take care of it. Oh, brother! Do you know what my greatest weakness is? The voice of a beautiful girl when she wakes up from her sleep. It seems as if all the melodies are playing all at the same time. You think I am bluffing? I swear, I am speaking the truth. I wanted to tell you one more thing... No, not over the phone. I will tell you when we meet. All right, then. At four in the evening. At my farmhouse. I am Vicky speaking. Know why I telephoned you early in the morning? So that if I hear your voice the first thing in the morning... ...the day would prove to be a pleasant one. In the evening? If I see you in the evening... ...even the stars could be seen during the day. I swear, I am telling the truth. I will tell you the rest when we meet. All right, then. At five in the evening. At my farmhouse. And now, I have to call Natasha! What's the matter? You see Rajni in me! It was a slip of the tongue! You were to come at 5 'o clock. How did you come earlier? - You changed the program. - I did? Yes, your secretary called and asked me to come at 4 'o clock. Here I am. We'll get an hour more to ourselves. - Hide inside! - Where? Hide in the bathroom. I'll send him off and return! - Let's go! - Wait and watch the fun... ...he gave me Rs.100! I was about to return, dejected. Why? I am only 10 minutes late. For people in love, even 10 minutes can prove to be like 10 centuries! - Let's go out. - Why? There's no servant at home and... My father has come! Go and hide inside the bathroom. No! Not in the bathroom. Anywhere except the bathroom! - There's a problem? - Why? Daddy's arrived and is inside. - ...so, today's plan... - Madam... - Madam, your letter. - My letter? "My love, Vicky..." "...I have told Daddy everything." "He has no objections to our marriage." "Now, don't get involved with those cheap, greedy girls..." "...Rajni, Kanchi, Natasha and Pinky." "Yours lovingly, Kavita." You flirt with us and are marrying someone else? - Listen to me Kavita... - Not Kavita, Natasha! So, this is it! You hid them inside and said Daddy was there? If you call us or come home, the consequences won't be good! He goes around like a Romeo! How often have I told you not to play these pranks? Today you landed him in trouble. When I saved him from a sticky situation, ask him what he did. You thought the reward I gave you was less. And so... I did not save you for the reward! You wanted me to be obligated and come closer to me. You wanted to bridge the gap between us. - Don't forget your status. - You judge... I can earn wealth, but you can't change your character. So, to maintain a distance is up to me. Not you. Shut up, Sapna! If you utter another word... Go... Go inside! I'm sorry. The good-for-nothing caused you a lot of trouble. Ask your daughter never to forget what she is. ...and never to mess with my personal life. ...else... That wasn't a good thing you did. For the first time... ...I was reminded of my status. That too, by my master's younger son! Why don't you understand? I wanted him to understand that... ...we too have as much right to live with dignity as those rich people. Yes, the poor do have that right. But... ...the rich have given them that right. One needs food to survive and this food... ...is given by those rich people. And you're abusing them? What's ahead in life, can never be brought back. However high the Earth may rise, it can never touch the moon. Remember one thing, you're a poor driver's daughter... ...and will always be recognized as one! Because this is what Fate has decreed. Understand? Will your uncle get me a job in Bombay? Yes, but... No ifs and buts. I will go with you to Bombay. I will return only when... ...I have changed the lines of destiny on my hands. Stop, please. - How much is the fare? - 100 rupees, sir. What a price of hiring a taxi. My wallet is empty. You... at this place...? Look, this isn't a doctor's residence nor is it a hospital. What do you want? Looks like I have pressed the bell in a wrong house. Surely the Saturn and Mars are in a clashing position today. My ad turned out to be bad, I met with an accident... ...and now who has entered inside the home... - Greetings, sir. - I want to ask you something. - What's the name of this place? - Shiv Sagar, sir. - And who lives in house number 11? - You live there, sir. I live there, don't I? And what's my name? Are you sure that I am Gurdass Banerjee? - Yes, sir. - I am Gurdass Banerjee. I live in house number 11. Then how did the confusion arise? Hey! You have returned again? Who are you? That's what I want to ask you. Who are you? I see... you won't listen easily. I will telephone the police. I wonder what kind of people come knocking. - What's the matter, Sapna? - I don't know. He's trying to force himself inside. Uncle! What happened, Uncle? Did you meet an accident? Or did somebody beat you up? What has happened to you? I will tell you later. First tell me, when did you arrive from Simla? And what's this girl doing in my house? - Uncle, she's Sapna (a dream). - She's not a dream! She's reality. - Tell me who she is! - Uncle... Didn't I tell you about my girlfriend from Simla? She's the one. And Sapna, he's my Uncle. That's the reason why she was not allowing me entry in my own house. Uncle, let's go inside. We will talk after that. Look, Sapna. If uncle says that... ...you can become a model, then you definitely can. Yes, but becoming a model doesn't just mean... ...dressing up and standing on a stage. To become a good model, acting skills are a must. Are you adept at a little bit of acting? You'll make me act? You silly old man! You'll make a model! Haven't come here to act or model. I have come to extract revenge from you. Your performance was stupendous! You are a performer! You lure innocent girls into modeling and ruin them! You molest them! And if you fear being exposed, you even kill them! My sister, for example... my innocent sister... ...what harm had she done to you? Was it because she wanted to achieve something? But instead of supporting her, you pushed her into the sea! Look, you have definitely misunderstood something. No, Gurdass Banerjee! Your game is over now! - Take the Lord's name... - I will, I will... I'm sorry uncle. I abused you a lot! But how did you find my acting? What are you doing here? You should be in Hollywood. You really scared me! Is the job on? About the job... it's like this... ...you've to react to the finer points in modeling. That, I'll have to teach you. Thereafter, the job's on. Now, I'll teach you the art of applying lipstick. Take a cherry-red lipstick and apply it to your lips. Now pull your tongue out! Now carefully apply the mascara. Why? What happened? - This is good. - This is better. We've conquered the whole of the advertising field! Your ad. film has created a sensation! Four of the models even attempted suicide! Honestly! This is the payment for your first ad. film. Payment for the contract with Dabur. 5 big offers in just one day! "You wanted me to be obligated so you could come closer." "You wanted to bridge the distance between us." "Don't forget your status! You're a mere driver's daughter." "You'll always be called that, because it's what Fate has decreed." What are you thinking about? Tell me quickly... ...to whom should we give our approval? Refuse all of them for the time-being. What are you saying? Are you mad? Why Sapna? What's the matter? - I've to go to Simla. - Whatever for? He told me the daughter of a driver will always be recognized as one. Besides, the lines of destiny on one's hands keep changing. It's a shame on our city to see you standing here. This city once used to be known for the fun and frolic here. And today, a beautiful girl like you stands alone! Without asking you, where you've got to go. - Where do you have to go? - I don't talk to strangers. The Saigal family is no stranger to anyone in Simla. I think you've come here for the first time. No. I went from here for the first time to return now. How amazing! A pretty girl stays here and I don't even know about it! Isn't it possible that earlier on, I wasn't worth noticing? Impossible! No matter where a gem is, it can't escape my attention! What is your name? - Your name first. - Ask me lovingly and... ...the name, profession, address... all details flow from my lips. - Your name? - Love-lorn. - Your address? - Your heart! - What do you do? - I love you. - What's the outcome? - Whatever it is. What's your name? The one dying for your love. Give me your address. It's your heart. What's your name? The one dying for your love. Give me your address. It's your heart. What do you do? I love you. Do you know the outcome of this? Whatever it may be! What's your name? The one dying for your love. Give me your address. It's your heart. What do you do? I love you. Do you know the outcome of this? Whatever it may be! What's your name? The one dying for your love. I'm crazy for you and you're crazy for me. So why are you upset with me? I won't agree to anything. I know exactly what you want. Sometimes Laila, sometimes Majnu. Oh... Go away! Sometimes Shirin, sometimes Farhaad. Don't trouble me. Sometimes Raanjha, sometimes Heer. I'll tear your heart. Sometimes Romeo, sometimes Juliet. Come on.. Move aside. What's your name? The one dying for your love. Give me your address. It's your heart. What do you do? I love you. Do you know the outcome of this? Whatever it may be! What's your name? The one dying for your love. I have heart in my chest, there are heartbeats in my heart. You reside in those heartbeats. I won't fall for your words. Don't try to express your love to me. I won't leave your path. You're a bee and I'm a flower. Hey queen, don't be rude. Don't hold my hand. My intentions are honest. You're a lying lover. Place me in your dreams. Don't make excuses. What's your name? The one dying for your love. Give me your address. It's your heart. What's your name? The one dying for your love. Give me your address. It's your heart. What do you do? I love you. Do you know the outcome of this? Whatever it may be! What's your name? The one dying for your love. Give me your address. It's your heart. What's your name? The one dying for your love. Give me your address. It's your heart. What's your name? The one dying for your love. - Where do you stay? - With my father. - What does he do? - He drives a car. Drives a car? Oh, I got it... You're the daughter of Mahendra Singh, owner of M.K. Motors. - No. - Then? Turn to the left here. What a lovely co-incidence. This road leads to my house! It also leads to my house. Then we are neighbors! How amazing! Living in the same city and same locality! ...we haven't met each other in our childhood and have met now! Actually, this is the right age to meet. Enter the gate ahead. I liked your sense of humor. You didn't tell me your address. ...but have reached me to my own house! This is my house. - This is my house! - Haven't you recognized me? I am Sapna. Your driver's daughter. - Dharampal Uncle's daughter? - Yes. I couldn't have even imagined! Uncle, look whom I have brought along. You won't recognize her! When I couldn't, how can you? She is the same super-brat, proud and loud - Sapna! - Daughter! - Father! My child, you have changed completely! But nothing here has changed. Everything is the same as before. Because of the height, storms like the one today are bound to occur! What are you doing in the evening? After you left... ...a good restaurant has opened here. Will you come for dinner with me? - I am a bit tired today. - How about tomorrow afternoon then? I haven't seen such beautiful hair till today. It looks as if your head were covered with a veil of black roses! This forehead of yours, with lines creased in deep thought... ...looks like a lonely wave in the pond of a moonlit night. And these eyes... ...they're like the ocean in your captivity. - And these lips... - You said nothing about my nose!? - Your nose? - Okay. It does flow sometimes... ...but it doesn't mean that you don't praise it! You've messed it! In such a romantic mood, where did you bring that running nose from? Okay. Go ahead. I love to be praised. - Now I'll say nothing! - You'll simply stare into my eyes! - Yes. - For how long? - For life! - You can't do it for even 3 minutes! - I can. - Let's bet. If you lose, will you do what I say? Agreed. And if I win, will you do what I have to say? I agree. I won! Nothing doing. Now listen to your punishment! Yes. You'll have to talk to that man for 10 minutes! - Okay, I will. - Be careful and beware! - He looks like a prude. - Everyone melts to my charms. 10 minutes! Sit down please! I think we have met before. I wish we had met! - What's your name? - Don't be formal with me, please! Hey! What's your name? Wow! What style! Tell me your name. People lovingly call me Salma. What do they call you in anger? When you are angry, you look like Shah Rukh Khan. I am so happy that you've met your dream-girl. What a pair! Look Salim, alias Salma, alias Balma... ...don't you feel that we've spoken for not a minute, but... ...for 10 minutes? I feel as if we're inseparable from the last 10 births! That's it. So, you see, I've met your condition. - Please stay back. - Move off! - Hey, you! What is it? - Leave me. Not I, it's she who hit you! I didn't do anything. This hunk was teasing me. Don't you have a father or brother! I've a brother. Hey, brother! Save me, my honor's at stake! I'll die! Hey brother! Listen to me, please... Please don't beat him. You!? You are the... Brother! I think his brother has come. Wow! He hits so well! You were amazing brother. Had it not been for you today, my... Shut up! This is all your doing! If you ever again... - What muscles! - Who is this? - The same. Now fight. - Get lost. What weird friends you have! - Listen to me. - Get lost! Papa, switch off the lights. I'm very sleepy. You are not sleepy... ...you are in a hurry to dream. Have you forgotten what I told you? However high the Earth may rise, it can never touch the moon. You are mistaken. The Earth is in its place... ...the moon is bending low to touch it. You know the kind of guy Vicky is. You also know what kind of a girl I am. I know, but the world... Please Papa. I'm very sleepy. A little this way... That's enough. Now I'll take some. Come on, Sapna. Hurry up. Okay. But keep your eyes closed. My eyes are closed. No one is watching us. Gosh! I have had it! I won't spare you, Sapna! What's happened? I knew someone will cast an evil eye on us. What else can happen in such... ...a beautiful climate with such a beautiful girl? Tell me at least what has happened? The car's broken down and we've come so far, we can't return right now. You sit here. I'll take a look. I'll see if there's a mechanic or a place to stay. Come back soon. I get scared all alone. I'll be back in a moment. - You can occupy 2 or 3 rooms. - No, not like this. I'll ask you, "Excuse me, can I get two rooms?" And you'll say, "Certainly not, you can get only one room". Sir, I hope there's no hanky-panky. When you have 500 rupees speaking, then... - One shouldn't interfere. - One shouldn't! Sir, is there no luggage? No, but my pockets are filled with money. If I fill both your pockets with Rs.100 bills, what will you do? I'll be called your Man Friday! Who will simply echo your words. I'll send for two cups of coffee. Signal to me and tell me in which you've put this. Understand? I and my pockets, have both understood, Sir! Here I go, to return in a jiffy! And yes, the room should be spotlessly clean! Did you leave the car on the road? No, I got it pushed till here. There it is. There's a problem. The hotel is fully booked. We can get only one room. We can't get another room. - Certainly not! - Certainly not! There's only one way. You sleep in the room and I'll sleep in the car. In this winter you'll freeze like a candy! - What can we do? - We'll share one room. Share one room?! How can that happen? What can we do? We're helpless. - Alright. The keys. - Right away! Should I bring some dinner? Not food. Bring two cups of coffee. You can proceed to the room. I'll bring it right away. - You are very lucky. - Why? At least you got a room in such winter. - It's nice, isn't it? - It's excellent. Just imagine... if we hadn't got this room, what would happen of us? - What else do we want? - Two cups of hot coffee! It's chilly, isn't it? Why don't you light a fire? Before the coffee arrives, let me refresh myself. - Which one? - The one with the spoon. Come in. Over there, on the table. It's alright. I'll make it. - Sugar? - Two spoons. Only your name is there on my lips. It's my job to love you. Only your name is there on my lips. It's my job to love you. Day and night I'm crazy in your love. Sweetheart I love you, you love me. Sweetheart I love you, you love me. Only your name is there on my lips. It's my job to love you. Day and night I'm crazy in your love. Sweetheart I love you, you love me. Sweetheart I love you, you love me. This night is sleepy and lost. My desires are awakening. What has happened to me? The shadows of your tresses are like a curtain. Come here my love, let me move them. So that I can see your face. There's a drink of passion. You're the prize of love. Day and night I'm crazy in your love. Sweetheart I love you, you love me. Sweetheart I love you, you love me. The cold breeze is creating magic. My eyes are thirsty. An intoxication is spreading around. These fair arms are calling you. Come, let me end this separation. So that there's no distance between us. This is the message of my heart. You're my peace and my rest. Day and night I'm crazy in your love. Sweetheart I love you, you love me. Sweetheart I love you, you love me. Only your name is there on my lips. It's my job to love you. Day and night I'm crazy in your love. Sweetheart I love you, you love me. Sweetheart I love you, you love me. Sweetheart I love you, you love me. Sweetheart I love you, you love me. - Which one? - The one with the spoon. Over there, on the table. It's alright. I'll make it. - Sugar? - Two spoons. - It's cold, isn't it? - Yes. Here, have some hot coffee. Stoke the fire too. - Is the coffee alright? - Yes. Are you okay? What's the matter? Why are you so quiet? What was Dharam Pal's daughter doing in your room? Sapna? In my room? The question simply does not arise! Don't pretend. I saw her coming out of your room at 2 'O clock in the morning. Now you dare to bring the girls into the house! That too, the servant's daughter?! - She is not your servant. - If she was of our status... ...we still wouldn't have tolerated this. That she does something so cheap in our house in front of our very eyes! - She hasn't done anything cheap. - Then what's the truth? I had taken Sapna to dinner last night. I began to feel ill there. I don't remember, but I think she left me home. Mummy saw her leaving my room and made a mountain of a molehill. You mean I'm falsely accusing you? No matter which girl you are with... ...the inference drawn will be the same. This matter has crossed all limits. If you don't change your ways, we'll have to think about it. Then think! Think whatever you wish! I don't owe anybody an explanation. See how impudent he's become! He takes our love to be our weakness! If you force him, he'll never change. You know how stubborn he is. Besides... What do you want? Should our name be tarnished because of the useless chap? We should learn the truth before taking a step further. Sapna is not a wayward girl. And Vicky is not her close friend. We must find out why she went to his room. You're saying this in spite of knowing your brother? I know Sapna too. Don't worry. I'll speak to her. What would you like to eat? Some ice-cream or dessert? Nothing. Thanks. - Let's talk business. - Business? What business? Your intentions weren't just to bring me for lunch. You want to speak to me about something. - You are very clever. - You are absolutely right. People have this misconception that beauty and brains can't co-exist. - Anything else, Sir? - Nothing, bring the bill. I wonder what causes these unseasonal rains. It looks like a rich-man is showing his benevolence to a poor one. I love to get wet in the rain. Care to join me? - Where? - To get drenched in the rains. - This way... - Feel these drops on your face... You'll really enjoy it. What did you want to tell me? I want to talk to you about Vicky. You don't know about his reputation. People think he's... You are cautioning me against your brother? That's because you're not one of those girls I don't care about. That's what I want to know. Why do you care about me? Mummy saw you coming out of Vicki’s room last night and... And she thought we were having an affair! And she has sent you here... ...so that like a good businessman you can explain the deal! - Don't misunderstand me... - You're misunderstanding me! Because the truth is that your brother took me to the hotel... ...where he wanted to give me coffee mixed with drugs... ...but because I know Vicky so well... ...I made him drink that coffee. My mistake was that I brought him home instead of dumping him there. If you don't believe me, then you may ask your brother. I know it's my brother's fault... It isn't your brother's fault. The fault lies in my poverty. Because if I was a rich man's daughter... ...you wouldn't tell me anything. You'd have made him see sense. Listen to me, you'll get drenched. I'll drop you home. I know my way around. Besides, nothing will happen to me if I get wet. The stigma you have attached to my name, can never be washed off. And yes! Tell the Mistress that her son's honor is safe. I am going back to Bombay. Are you convinced that she will go away? If she says that she will go, it means she will go away. Besides, that girl doesn't lie. What's the matter? You appear disturbed. Yes, of course. It is Vicky who is at fault... ...and Sapna was hurt unnecessarily. If one's own family member is at fault, others shouldn't be blamed. If it was such a matter, I would've thrown out the person long ago. But no matter how a progeny is, he can't be thrown away just like that. Then try to get him married to some girl like Sapna. At least he will become a better person. Why? What's so special about Sapna? Meet her sometime and see for yourself. Tell her... I don't like you leaving like that condition. A daughter anyway doesn't stay for long at her father's house. I agree. But that sadness is mixed with happiness too. Get married. It's better than living alone in an unknown land. - No, Papa. - Yes. With you in your in-laws' house, I'll be at peace. Shankar's Uncle has proposed to me several times. The lines of destiny on my hand haven't yet fully changed. - She's gone to Bombay. - Gone to Bombay? Till last night, she didn't mention anything to me. She didn't tell me earlier. But she suddenly decided to go. Since I have to drive the master, she went alone to the station. - At what time is her train leaving? - At 4 'o Clock. Aren't you simply fabulous! You planned it and didn't even tell me! What would you do if I had told you? I wouldn't have allowed you to go. And if I did... ...I would have hosted a grand farewell party for you. A party similar to the one you gave at Simla Motel? It wasn't a party there. There... You took me there to flirt with me. You think you're very smart... ...you think no one can see through you... But you are mistaken. Behind this happy facade... ...your true identity is clearly visible. You reek of insincerity. Stop this game of love that you play with girls. Sapna, please wait. For the first time, I've found a girl who was unaffected by my status. Status!? What is your status? What do you possess that you talk about your status? Wealth and respect are your ancestral property. Your father and brother have earned the money. What can you call your own, except your name and looks? - What are you talking? - I'm holding a mirror to you! Something that no one has dared to do till now. You say that you love me? You are lying! Because you've said it to every girl who isn't deaf. It isn't a wonder to love someone. But it is a wonder when others can't help but love you. If you have the courage, then prove your worth... ...not only I, but the whole world will bow to you. The Young Master says he won't eat dinner today. Okay. What is the matter? He's in his room since the morning. I know my son Vicky is depressed at Dharampal's daughter's departure. Carefree boys like Vicky are like the running stream. They find their own course of flowing. Now, if some Tina or Meena were to call up... ...he'd forget he'd ever met someone called Sapna. There it is! It's for you. Yes, Mr. Gokhale. Tell me. I'll be there by tomorrow morning's flight. Listen, keep all my files ready. Mummy, I'll be gone for a few days. Please pack my bags. What is our schedule for today? There's a meeting with a delegation from France at 3. And at 7 p.m., the export advisory committee's report will be presented. And at night, there's a party-cum-conference. Where the transparencies and photos of the new ad. film will be shown. - What kind of an ad. is it? - The shooting is still going on. Come on, get up. Walk. Okay now, stop. Stop the crane. Look up. She's ready. Then call her. Lower down. Tell Mr. Vijay that I'll meet him after one shot is completed. Go and prepare for the conference. I'll come there directly. You should hold the bottle in this manner. This is an ad. for champagne. You tilt the camera from the bottle to the face. Okay? I'll get you introduced to the person for whom we are doing this ad. You did a fantastic job! I've yet to see something like this. Where is he? He went away without telling us. Big people are always in a hurry. He must not have had the time and so has left. I'll leave. If you don't run away before hearing me out, can I leave you home? You? Here in the studio? I wanted to see what a firebrand girl from the mountains would do here. Have you come to meet me? This is not possible. I came to meet someone else, but met you instead. I am happy to see your success! You are worthy of greater praise then what I've heard. Now I got it! Sorry, Sir. I didn't know Meghdoot is your company. Else I wouldn't have dared to model for an ad. of your company. I didn't know that your hatred stretched from Simla to Bombay. This isn't hatred but a feeling of humiliation. Even when the wounds heal, the scars always remain. Sit in the car. I wish to talk to you. What is it? Please tell me here. I wish to pacify you. That will happen only after eating an ice-cream. It is not this. It is something else. I'll tell you on the way. Come. Tell me, what did you want to talk about? - I wanted to apologize to you. - What? I wanted to apologize for the misunderstanding we had in Simla. Even before I could say something, you came away to Bombay. Which makes my debt of shame and seeking apology unbearable. Tell me, how can I make up for it? You will be forgiven, on only one condition. Condition? What is that? - That I won't eat ice-cream. - Then? You'll have to come to my house and drink the coffee I've prepared. Why? Do you prepare such horrible coffee? You'll have to drink it, however it is. Take a right from here. - Please come. - No, not today. I have an important meeting today. - I knew you'd say that. - I knew you'd think so. But I promise to come anytime to have that coffee. Everything is ready. Should we show the transparencies? I've yet to see a model so beautiful! - You?! - Yes! Didn't I tell you, I'd come? Here I am! - May I come in? - Please do. Sorry to have come at such an odd hour. But I thought, why not accept the invitation today? And so, I came over for coffee. If you were a little late... ...you'd have been drenched and you don't like that. Please sit down. I'll bring you some coffee. Look at the lightning in the rain. The chain of raindrops has drenched my body. Look at the lightning in the rain. The chain of raindrops has drenched my body. The weather is beautiful and romantic. The clock of the heart is ticking. Look at the lightning in the rain. The chain of raindrops has drenched my body. There's a little bit of restlessness and intoxication. I'm feeling euphoric now. The mischievious wind is ringing the ankle bells. I don't know what's the intention of the monsoon. Take care of me, I'm in great trouble. Look at the lightning in the rain. There's fragrance in this place, everything is wonderful. I have no clue of what's going on. This is the effect of unknown desires. There's a new kind of thirst on my wet lips. My feet are slipping, how can I stand stable? Look at the lightning in the rain. The weather is beautiful and romantic. The clock of the heart is ticking. Look at the lightning in the rain. The chain of raindrops has drenched my body. Look at the lightning in the rain. The chain of raindrops has drenched my body. Drenched as you are, you're bound to like this coffee. Here are your medicines. The doctor has advised extreme care.. ...else this could lead to pneumonia. He has restricted your diet to just tea, coffee and biscuits. ...medicines thrice a day and complete rest. I couldn't understand one thing... ...even kids don't get wet in such rains. What happened to you? You had said it was fun to get drenched in the rains. When there's a shower of sudden, unseasonal rains... ...it seems like the rich are being benevolent towards the poor. I wanted to see... ...how it feels when someone is benevolent towards another. Don't repeat my words. I'm a bit crazy. I too think the same about myself. There will be a hell of a time when two nuts get together! - What's this? - It's bitter-gourd. A bitter-gourd? Papa says that it helps a person in curing from a cold ailment. But eat little at a time. It's supposed to be very bitter. It's sweet. - Sweet? - You cooked it, didn't you? Brother? You are telephoning at this late hour? - Are you fine? - I am perfectly fine. - Tell me, what are you doing? - I was sleeping. What? You return home only in the morning. And you are sleeping at 12 midnight itself. - Are you feeling unwell? - No, brother. I had been to the office today. I can understand why you went to the office. But how come you have got used to sleeping early? The thing is, Sapna... So that I can see as much of Sapna (dreams) as I can. Even I am seeing Sapna (dreams) these days. But with open eyes. What's the matter? You are being very romantic. That's because I am seeing Sapna (a dream). Looks like Bombay's fairies are more beautiful than those in Simla. No, Vicky. They are the same. It's just they were not visible from the heights of Simla. Anyway, I suppose you will reach before my birthday. I will reach as soon as the Nasik job is finished. Remember... l won't cut the cake till you arrive. And listen... what gift are you getting for me? - Gift? - What did you say? - I said what gift are... - Sofa? - Not sofa, I mean a gift. - Speak loudly, Brother. - Gift! A gift! I can't hear a thing. He can't hear it when it's something important. Brother, it's better if you go to sleep. See Sapna (dreams) yourself, and let me see Sapna (dreams) too. This place is 12 kilometers. away from Nasik. The water on all four sides... ...will take your champagne and whiskey on a trip to the skies! The champagne and whiskey distilled here... ...will prove to be excellent and of international quality. Show me the blueprint. What a beautiful place. I wish there was a small bungalow here... ...beneath the wales of whose red-flowers, I would lie... ...with the clouds sailing above me. It will be wonderful. What's the matter, Sir? Does the plan lack something? Nothing, really. Do one thing... ...draw up a new plan. Instead of a factory, a bungalow will be built here. - I was only joking. - But I am serious. Do you mind if I say something? Go ahead. You are one of those whom girls dream about. Why didn't any girl come into your life? ...but none found the way to my heart. So, they must have returned dejected. Well said. That was a good line. But it's obvious that you're lying. Sorry. I won't ask you anything now. She had come. She had come in my life. I too loved her a lot. So much so that the word 'love' seemed insignificant before her. But... ...her aspirations and intentions were higher than the mountains of Simla. She wanted to rise very high. But I could not leave Simla... ...and so she must have left me and gone. Do you know, Vijay?... The wonder of hiding sorrow is called laughter. Here is your hot tea with spices. - I'll bring you some potato cutlets. - Bring them soon. How come you speak such good Marathi? I can even speak Tamil, Malayalam, Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi... And Odissi, Chinese, Japanese, African... - You know all of them!? - I don't know them. Tell me, how would you say "I am not feeling cold" in Marathi? And "I cannot return today" in Bengali? How do you say, "I am lonely" in Tamil? And "the night is young" in Malayalam? And "I spoke my heart" in Punjabi? And "I love you" in Gujarati? Do I need to translate this too? Dance with me... On my white wrists, there is a bracelet. The bracelet is chanting your name, O beloved! Dance with me... There are heartbeats in my heart, there's love in my heartbeats. My love is chanting your name, O beloved. Dance with me... Only God knows how this miracle happened. I have no control over my heart. Dance with me... How should I describe this, my friend? This wasn't my condition before. I swear to you, my beloved, I was never in love before. I said it, you heard it, a great story has formed. Passion has been growing, there is a good excuse now. There are anklets on my feet, there are bells on my anklets. The bells are chanting your name, O beloved! Dance with me... There are heartbeats in my heart, there's love in my heartbeats. My love is chanting your name, O beloved. Dance with me... Beloved it's my promise and I won't break it. I won't leave your side even if the entire world is upset with me. I want to spend my entire life under the shadow of your eyes. My restlessness is saying to come and embrace me. There are songs on my lips, there are tunes in the songs. These tunes are chanting your name, O beloved. Dance with me... On my white wrists, there is a bracelet. The bracelet is chanting your name, O beloved! Dance with me... Only God knows how this miracle happened. I have no control over my heart. Dance with me... Come here son. I've something important to tell you. Before your mother comes here, give me a cigarette. I've told you several times that I've left wine, women and cigarettes. - I'll leave now. - No. Come here and sit. We are more of friends and less of father and son. How did this revolution take place in the settlement called your heart? How did our foot-loose, fun-loving Casanova change? I've changed my mirror... ...and have now started viewing the truth. - I shall leave now. - Carry on. - How are you? - Fine. Uncle, please sit down. Let's go. Vicky, your phone... This is Pooja speaking. May I speak to Vicky? Why Vicky? You may even talk to his father. - Who are you? - Oh, Pooja, what should I say... ...whom I am. You can consider me to be an unfortunate being... ...who has a storm in his heart and dreams in his eyes... ...looking out for that smile on which I can shower my entire wealth. What is happening? - Nothing, Madam. - Then go and do your work. Unfortunately, I couldn't become a husband. You're a billionaire and still haven't become a husband... ...how is that possible? Why haven't you married as yet? I did marry, but I couldn't become a husband. That's because my wife likes to play the role of the husband. - I sympathize with you. - I sympathize with myself too. Why don't we meet somewhere?... Anywhere? How about it? And... ...share our sorrows with each other. - Sure. Where do we meet? - In the Mental Hospital. Who's this third-person interrupting? I'm the nurse speaking. You were speaking to a lunatic all this while. Poor Uncle! He's had it today! I was waiting for you all this while and where and what were you doing? I was trying to be a husband. You were... trying... to be.. ...a... husband...! - What were you doing? - I was just... The doctor has advised me to fool around a bit. - Your name is Sonia? - Yes. But people lovingly address me as Sona. - Other experiences besides typing? - Besides typing... ...I have many other qualifications, Sir. - You may leave. - What? The qualifications that you possess... ...the company or me don't need them at all. Take a bet today, Sapna. A lifetime would pass away, but I wouldn't bat my eyelids. Didn't I tell you that you cannot win a bet with me? All right. But if I hadn't lost, how would you have won? Anyway, tell me, what's the punishment for losing the bet? - A life imprisonment. - A life imprisonment? Yes, Sapna. I want to make my dream come true. I want to marry you. - How long will we have to wait now? - Let me look into it. It's very late. Where's Vicky? There he is. Come... The guests are waiting. Cut the cake... I can't cut it with my brother absent. It's your birthday. He could have even missed his flight. Come... Till today, you've never celebrated. Brother! I was sure that you would come. I've come and have brought someone along too. Vicky, Sapna is wishing you! How did you bring Sapna? Sapna (dreams) can be brought hidden only in one's eyes. When you went away angrily, I thought you'd never return. If there is someone to beckon, then the past too returns. I am only human. I can return at your call. So, you heard my heart calling out? How wouldn't she? A heart always hears what another heart has to say. The guests are still waiting. When will you cut the cake? You're hiding your age like a girl! Only one candle? The truth is that this is the first birthday of a new Vicky. - And you are the reason for this. - I? A joke turned into love could even melt the heart of a stone. - Well said! That's a good line. - It's the truth. This is the devotion of a heart. Don't think that this is just love. This is the devotion of a heart. Don't think that this is just love. I've attained the happiness that I'd wished for. This is the devotion of a heart. Don't think that this is just love. This is the devotion of a heart. Don't think that this is just love. I was very naive. I didn't understand what love is. I was changeable. I didn't know what loyalty is. With chains no one has... ...been able to tie a heart. You get your desires by fate. Wealth can't play any role in it. May the intoxication of love never decrease in life. This is the devotion of a heart. Don't think that this is just love. This is the devotion of a heart. Don't think that this is just love. When you have love in your heart... ...the entire world seems like heaven. The one who attains love here is the richest person. The one who gives life in love. The one who sacrifices his life for love... ..You find that person with great difficulty. The one who recognizes hearts. Love is God. Love is devotion. This is the devotion of a heart. Don't think that this is just love. This is the devotion of a heart. Don't think that this is just love. This is the devotion of a heart. Don't think that this is just love. Times have surely changed. But not so much that... ...servants and their daughters could dance with the Masters... ...and sing along with them. How could you dare to invite Dharampal's daughter to our party? She is surely Dharampal driver's daughter. But for your information, she is also the top model of the country. Look, clear, we have listened to everything you have said. But it doesn't mean that you can behave whimsically. Where have we behaved whimsically? Like others, she too was a guest. All the guests were of our status. They were all rich people... ...hailing from high-ranking families, except for that girl. There's nothing like a high-ranking or a low-ranking family. Birth is only an accident, and an individual has no control over it. - Absolutely right! - No nonsense! God has made high castes, low castes. Such relationships cannot be changed. One will remain wherever one belongs. If you are a son, you will always remain one. You cannot become my father! I agree that blood relationships cannot be changed. All other relationships can be changed. Today, Sapna is merely a driver's daughter. Tomorrow, she can become this family's daughter-in-law too. You have said what I also feel. What's wrong in Sapna? She's educated, she's beautiful... - ...she's decent, she's honest. - Yes, mother. She has all the qualities that... ...a daughter-in-law of our family should have. This girl surely knows black magic. Earlier there was only one mad person. Now both of them have become mad. They are talking of bringing her as a daughter-in-law in my house. Both of you had understand this clearly. Such a thing wouldn't happen in my lifetime. Only a daughter-in-law of my choice would come, not yours. Mother, listen... What's this? You know how your mother's nature is, don't you? Today you have done something that... ...even God wouldn't have done even if I had sat in a temple all my life. You have been wonderful, brother. You even told our parents that Sapna can get married into our family! I know, only my brother can understand the plight of my heart. You can understand my deep love for her. I cannot live without her. She has shown me the path of Love. I became crazy about Sapna. I cannot imagine life without her, Brother. Since when have you become so serious about Sapna? The day she told me what my status was... ...that the wealth belongs to my family. That what do I have except for my face and my name. Her statements have changed me totally. Cigarette, liquor, parties, girls... l have left everything. All the while, I keep wondering howl can win over Sapna. And you solved this problem for me. Does Sapna knows about this? Yes, you had said, didn't you... ...that a heart always hears what another heart has to say. Today you have done something that... ...even God wouldn't have done even if I had sat in a temple all my life. I became crazy about Sapna. I cannot imagine life without her, Brother. You can understand my deep love for her. I cannot live without her. I cannot live without her. I cannot live without her. Don't give me any calls. Cancel all meetings for today. Yes. Who? Yes, send her in. Come, Sapna. Sit down. You neither called me nor met me. So I thought of meeting you. It's not that. I've such a lot of work today... No problem... Our parents didn't mind my presence in the party yesterday, did they? No. Not at all. Which means that they have no objections to our marriage. Here's the blueprint of your house to be built in Nasik. - Keep it here. - Our house!? Such a big house, just for us! And this porch! Look Vijay... And this garage... So many cars! This is the swimming-pool. Is this a drawing room or a palace? Glass-panes on all the sides. Only windows and nothing else! And when we sit in there, then... ...and six bedrooms? Three on the ground-floor and three upstairs. We will live upstairs and have our TV room on the ground-floor. But all this will happen... ...only when you speak to your parents about us. When will you speak to them about our marriage? Sapna, you? Today if I had asked... ...for anything else, I would have got that too. You know, I was thinking about you. Why? Didn't you find any other girl? I swear by you, I'm speaking the truth! We had an appointment for lunch which got canceled. So I thought, if we met, we could go to some good hotel. There's soft-music in the air, and the aroma of food reaching here! What are you staring at me for? - Vicky, I... - We won't get this chance again. ...for the heart, body and soul to get together. How ironical it is... ...I've grown up in the landscapes of this region... ...but the noon today has never looked more beautiful. These snow-covered, silvery mountains... ...and these paths looks as if the clouds had spread out their arms. - Do you know, why? - It's because... ...for the first time you've noticed something other than a girl! No. Something else is the reason. - What? - Should I tell her? - What happened? - What happened? We've got a flat-tire. No problem. I'll fix it in two minutes. We've reached echo-point. Come here, Sapna. I'll show you something. Look here. This is Echo Point. Shout! Go ahead and shout! I've come here several times and have heard the echo of my voice. But today, you'll hear my voice in answer to your voice. If you say, 'Vicky I love you', you'll get a reply, 'Sapna, I love you'. What happened? - You didn't hurt yourself, did you? - Nothing. The jack broke. I'll get another one from the mechanic. Wait here. I'll be back. Brother... You wait here, I'll go. Have you hurt just your hand or does your heart hurt too? I want to know who is playing this game with me. - Vicky or you? - Destiny is playing with all of us. It is very easy to blame destiny and shy away from the truth. Looking into my eyes, you once expressed your love for me... ...look into my eyes again in the same way and say you don't love me. Vicky loves you a lot. And you fooled around! Wonderful, Mr. Vijay Saigal. I didn't know that... ...the Vijay Saigal I met in Bombay was someone else. - No, Sapna. That isn't so... - Then what is it? People in love can even kill! And you can't even acknowledge it? Are blood-ties stronger than bonds of love? You are sacrificing your love for a rich, spoiled brat... - ...just because he's your brother? - He's improved. Your love has changed him. And so you've changed and want me to sacrifice my love! Life is not a gamble and I'm not a card that is discarded... ...whom one brother can discard and another can pick up. I cannot pressurize you... ...I can only request you. Please save my brother's life. Defeated in love, he'll lose control over himself. Make him understand. Clear his misunderstanding. Else, none of us will remain happy. Don't let this happen. Don't fall for the styles of the beautiful women. Friends love is deception, it has killed so many. I'm that crazy lover... I'm that crazy lover... ...who has been killed by love. Death left me alone. Death left me alone, but life has killed me. I'm that crazy lover... Unaware, thoughtless, merciless was the person I loved. I trusted my dear ones as well as strangers. I'm that darkness... I'm that darkness... ...who has been killed by light. I'm that crazy lover... May such a situation, such pain and such a night never arise. What happened with me may not happen to anyone else. People just talk here, no one has done it. Who here has fulfilled the relations of a heart. I'm that crazy lover... I'm that crazy lover... ...who has been killed by love. I'm that crazy lover... ...who has been killed by love. Death left me alone, but life has killed me. I'm that crazy lover... You talk about dying for someone's love. My beloved, what are you saying? For the beauties the heart is not a heart, it's a toy. The one who falls in love has to cry for life. Love makes you useless. Love makes you helpless. Love is deception. Love is a false story. Love damages your reputation. Love defames you. Don't ask me what love is. It's a beautiful trouble. It's a beautiful trouble. It's a beautiful trouble. I'm that helpless one... I'm that helpless one... ...who has been killed by helplessness. I'm that crazy lover... Brother! Brother! What happened? You've had liquor... Come on, now. Listen to me... A man worships God... ...because it is He who creates Man. Creates him, loves him, nurtures him and supports him. ...the way you supported me. But when you come to know that God has betrayed you... ...then what will you do? When you're immersed deep in meditation, with Him in heart... ...and he stabs you... in the back... ...what would you do? You wouldn't do anything. Because He is God. But the question arises that... ...where was the need for him to betray? Where was the need? I worship him... ...I am his devotee. He could have asked me. I would have given him everything. Because whatever I have, is given by Him. Come. But he betrayed me!? - Come... - Why did you betray me? Why did you betray me? - Come... - Why did you betray me? What is all this happening? I know what is happening... ...and also because of whom it is happening. I've called you here to tell you that... ...no matter how beautiful a snake is, it can never be cradled in your arms. You are indebted to us. And your honesty has set a precedent. All I have to say is that send Sapna away to Bombay today itself. Else... ...even you'll have to return. I am ready to leave from here... ...at this very moment. But not with the humiliation and insults that you've heaped on me. Nor will my father bow his head shamefacedly. Don't stop me, Papa. I've come to tell her that... ...there is always the other perspective of looking at things... ...which should be considered before deciding upon anything... Truth is not only that which is witnessed... ...Truth also prevails behind closed doors. Call your son Vijay and ask him what the truth is. Vijay, come out. Tell her. Tell her about the snake who has bitten you... ...tell her who brought her here, you or somebody else? Who ignited the flames... ...that would set afire this house. You or somebody else? Sapna is right, mother. She didn't want to come here. I brought her here. May I tell you one more thing? He brought me here to marry me... He thought that you, your society and your world... ...would accept me as your daughter-in-law. But I bear no grudge against Vijay. I'm grateful for the brief period he lit up my life. I don't want your riches and your wealth. Please forget that you had a driver called Dharampal. And forget that he had a daughter... Let us go, Papa. Vijay, you too got entrapped in that two-penny worth girl's charms? How did you even think that those living on the crumbs we throw... ...could become our daughter-in-law? The responsibility you took of driving her out of Vicki’s life... ...I feel now was very unwise to take. You were to maneuver the ship in the storm and take it to safety. - ...you befriended that very sea? - You're forgetting. That it was because of her that he changed for the better. I am prepared to accept all his vices. Because that will not tarnish the good name of the family. But I will not accept a girl from the lower strata as my daughter-in-law. Then listen to me, mother. Don't touch me! You've performed all duties of an elder brother. - She may have rejected my love... - Vicky, I... ...but you knew that I loved her. I couldn't live without her. When the very hands that held me, steadied me and sheltered me left me... ...I don't see any reason to live. - Where is he going? - I'll see. Vicky, stop! - Listen to me, Vicky! - Let us go after them. Stop, Vicky! Listen to me, Vicky! Stop, Vicky. Listen to me! I give you an oath, stop! Stop Vicky, for my sake! Listen to me! Stop! Why should I stop? When I've heard the entire story... ...seen Sapna getting humiliated... ...realized that she can never be the daughter-in-law of our house... ...the question of remaining alive does not arise. I'll make her understand. I'll tell her that... She'll listen to you. But will mother agree? Will your society agree? To hell with Society! I'll agree with whatever you say! What are you saying! That driver's daughter... You shut up! We've had enough! I won't tolerate your dictatorship any longer! My son's happiness means more to me than your snobbishness. It's thanks to Dharampal's daughter that he has turned a new leaf today. Instead of thanking her, you throw her out of the house! If today Vicky wishes to make her the daughter-in-law... ...then she certainly will. And this is my decision! Hurry up if you wish to stop her. She's gone to the station. Stop! You all wait here. - What happened? - I'll talk to her. - I'll come along. - No. If you don't succeed in coaxing her, you'll blame yourself for my death. Which I don't want. If I'm destined to live, Sapna will return. She will definitely return. Good I found you! There's good news for you... My parents are willing to accept you as their daughter-in-law. But I'm not ready. We would have lost our son because of your obstinacy. Vicky cannot live without Sapna. I am ready to do anything for you. I can leave home, rebel against this world and society... ...but you will have to come with me. If she doesn't agree with him, then you try your best. I know my mother humiliated you a lot. But like any other mother, she can't look beyond her son. But Vijay's the culprit. He fooled not only you, but me too. If Sapna doesn't return, I'll never be able to forgive myself. There's little time. If this train leaves, it won't return. You cannot go. If you do, I'll kill myself. And you'll be responsible for my death! Daddy, Vicky has come. I've got everything. From today, I won't ask for anything from you... ...I've got everything. Sapna, my child, won't you smile? Smile! You don't know how powerful your smile is. And if a man doesn't smile on such an occasion, when will he? How do you like their pair? - What misbehavior is this? - Did you hear that? Standing with one's future spouse is not misbehavior according to anyone. - What's happened to you? - What are you saying? You all have turned serious. So, I'll tell you the secrets. Do you think I can commit suicide? No way! I did all this so that Mummy and Daddy would accept Sapna. Because this big brother of mine... ...can do anything, except this. To love and to conquer Love... ...is our job! You think I was so cheap who after getting to know everything... ...I'd steal my brother's love? No. All your life you've been like Lord Rama... ...can I now not become his younger brother, Laxman? See Shanti, how lucky we are! We have not one Lord Rama, but two of them. You have gone far ahead in life. Brother! Forgive me, my child. - Madam... - Not Madam, call me mother. Do you know Sapna, because of you... ...I've become a husband after 26 years? - How is that? - Ask your mother. - How come mother? - Tell them. Don't become serious. I scolded you but that was also more of a joke. - And to celebrate that today... - She smiled...! And to celebrate it, there will be a party with drinks, cigarettes, sweets... - And singing too! - And singing too! Where is Vicky? It's a shame on our city to see you sitting here. This city used to be famous for the fun-loving and the newly-weds... And today, a beautiful girl like me has to sit here alone! ...with nobody to ask her where she's got to go. Isn't it? It looks like you too don't want to ask me where I've got to go. I came back to ask you just that! Where will you go? Very far. But till where will you be my companion? If you want, I can be with you for life. - Really? - Really. - Honest? - Absolutely. Let's go. The sooner this beautiful journey of life begins, the better. What's your name? - Tell me yours first. - I'm Love-lorn. - Where do you stay? - In your heart. - What do you do? - I love you. Timings and songs translated by Bluerain_20
