No, no, no, no, none of those games matter to me to be honest with you, I was all about "Contra." Ah, "Contra," man. That was my game. - I said it right. - Okay, okay, okay. - That was my game, man. - I couldn't get nowhere with that game, man, until I got all the fuckin' cheat codes, man. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Hey, what was the cheat codes? [Soldiers] Um, up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, Select, Start. (soldiers laughing) - You see, fellas, fellas, I never needed the cheat codes myself. - Hey, bullshit! - Bullshit! - No, I'm serious, man. - Get outta here. You couldn't get past the first level- Without a cheat code, man. - All right, okay, okay. - Sit down. - Shut up. - Best retro toy of all time? ThunderCats. - ThunderCats. - ThunderCats. [Soldiers] Ho! White, white, white. Got a bunch of rich kids here. - Rich kids. - "Care Bear Stare." Y'all don't know about that? - See, y'all know all these- - I know about the Care Bears. Boy games. "My Little Pony?" "Captain Planet," he's the hero. - Captain Planet! - Took pollution down to zero. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - Zero, yeah! The best toys growing up by far, "Star Wars." - Yes, Griffin! - Yes! Yes, that is what I'm talking about! - "Star Wars" sucked. - It's all about "G.I. Joe." Are you kidding me? That was the shit. (Sullivan gasps) - Cause it was about G.I. Joe. - No way, man! - Wait, G.I. Jane. - There it is right there. - No. - G.I. Joe. Snake Eyes would kill everyone in that stupid galaxy far, far away. Boba Fett was incredible, man. He had like a jet pack and could shoot missiles- He also died by accident. What are you talking about? Did you not see "Return of the Jedi?" He fell in the Sarlacc pit. He's an idiot. - Ah, yeah. Yoda then, Yoda could kick Snake Eye's ass any day. - Yoda? - I like Yoda. He's a glorified frog, give me a break. Are you serious right now? Yeah, no, I'm completely serious. It's a tiny little amphibian. What is it, what am I supposed to be scared of? - I don't know. - Bullshit!

Cargo's a lock, stocked and ready to rock. - Clear the area. - Roger that. All right, I'll hide the ones I killed. You get yours. No, those are mine over there. What, that's mine, I killed him. [Tagger] That was mine! He's got my knife. You hit the car three times and the wall twice. I didn't shoot the wall. Yeah, well, you hit the car three times. Okay, so I hit the car, it was in my way. What are you talking about? (eagle cawing) (light dramatic music) [Menzies] All right, let's hold up here, guys. We're gonna take five. Dude, my feet are killing me. I got blisters on blisters right now. Man, I felt like that the other day. Yeah? What'd you do about it? Just kept walking. Didn't act like a pansy ass bitch. (chuckling) Oh shit. You just got mode'ed. Mode'ed, what are you six? I remember that shit from back in the day. Yeah. What the hell is mode'ed? Oh, you wouldn't understand 'cause you're Oriental. Ping pang dong xing. Bong tai, bong xing xang. I'm Asian, dumb ass. And I'm from Wisconsin. Not cool, man. All right, listen up. There's a town about two clicks out. Need everyone to be ready and stay alert. Means you too, Sullivan. Let's move 'em out, Sergeant Griffin. All right, boys, you heard the Lieutenant. (light eerie music) (man singing in foreign language) (gravel crunching) (light dramatic music) (door thudding) (chicken clucking) - Oh, Jesus! It's a fuckin' chicken. Looks like someone's getting some action around- (gunshot banging) - Man down! [Menzies] Get down, protect yourself. [Riggs] He's coming from the south! [GQ] Troopers, watch your ammo! (gunshots banging) Where the fuck are they? We need a fucking medic right here! (explosion booming) We gotta move now! Let's go! (gunshots banging) Let's go! - I can't see 'em. - We gotta move! - I don't see shit! - Up front! - Quickly get a medic! (gunshots banging) (soldiers yelling) - Go, go! - Go, go, come on! (gunshots banging) (soldiers yelling) [Griffin] Man down! [Dominguez] Where's the fire coming from? Get back!

I can't feel my arm. It's 'cause you're laying on it. You all right? Hey, look at me. - Yeah, yeah. What the hell happened? Where are we? (Dominguez coughing) Dominguez, what the hell is this? [Dominguez] I don't know, man. It's not good though. - Behind you! - Identify yourselves! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, take it easy. We're Americans, Special Ops. No, fuck you. You come into my cave, collapse the entrance, and then points your guns at me? I should a shot your asses when your backs were turned. Griffin! We have a man down! He needs help! Watch 'em. If they move, shoot 'em. Move and I'll smoke you. Did he just stop breathing? (Lake panting) I tried that already. - Come on, Chen. - I can help. Don't do it. He's a medic. He can help. (Tagger sighs) Dammit, breathe. Come on, Chen. Come on, Chen. Chen, come on, brother. - Hey, hey, come on. Let's go, I can do it. His throat's swollen. Shithead, get over here. Who, who me? Get over here! - Hold on, hey! - Don't move. Dude, what the fuck? (Dominguez groaning) (flesh squishing) - Ew. (Chen gasps) He's breathing! He's breathing! - Oh, whoa, what, what? He just, he just stabbed him in the neck and now he's back alive. I guess that's what you do when you want someone to come back alive, you just, you just stab 'em in the neck. What was that? He did a tracheotomy. I suggest you get your weapon out of my face now. Now, any of you cocksuckers wanna tell me what happened to my cave? (ominous music) (Gunnar groaning) Are these the last two? Oh, let Reid and Tagger take 'em. [Vega] Okay, hold on. (truck engine rumbling) - Hey, we're out. [Vega] All right. I guess you're getting in the back. (Vega grunts) (car door slamming) (Griffin chuckling) - All set? - Yeah. Where the hell is Vega? He's taking a siesta in the back. I left my sword in the cave. [Vega] Leave it, leave it. Let's go get the chopper. (Gunnar groans) (truck door slamming) Don't miss the potholes. [Vega] I hope you can drive better than you can shoot. (Gunnar chuckling) [Tagger] After pulling off one of the biggest heists in history, we needed a safe place to hide the loot. Six hours was all Reid and I had to hold tight till Vega and the boys returned with the chopper. Then we'd load all the crates into the bird and fly out in the black of night. Easy peasy, but these dip shits turned that into a soup sandwich. (ominous music) Okay, just breathe slow. I just need to get this to stick. Take slow breaths, there you go. And try not to talk too loud, okay? Hey, use this. (tape ripping) I can't believe they're all dead, man. Cleveland, GQ, Wonder Bread, man. Let me guess? This is the first time everybody's taken fire, am I right? Well, you can either A: start sobbing like little bitches, or B: man the fuck up. Now, I'll give you all a moment to get your head back in the game. And then we move out in 10. Understood? - Wanna move out in 10, huh? The cave's collapsed, the entrance is sealed. We couldn't even budge those rocks. This cave has miles of tunnels in it. It just so happens that yours truly knows the way out. But it's a good distance, so if you need food and water, stock up. If you need to replenish ammo, help yourself. But don't touch those crates. And just who the hell are you? Besides the guy whose day just got blown to shit, the name's Tagger. This big guy right here, he's my partner, Reid. You both military? You said Special Ops, what division? Well, I'm thinking that that's classified. Oh, it's classified, huh? What the hell you doin' down here? Thought it'd be a good vacation spot, but it looked better in the brochure. (Reid chuckling) So, what's in all those crates? What's your name, sweetheart? It's Corporal Lake. Don't call me sweetheart. - Are you drug runners? - What kinda drugs? - It's probably opium. Opium? Yeah, I heard the CIA moves a lot of that shit. Trust me, if we were drug runners, you'd all be dead by now. Listen, can we stop with the 21 questions about my business, or is there gonna be a problem? Hear this, I don't care who you are or what you're doing down here, but these are my soldiers. And I ain't taking orders from you. Griffin, right? Listen, kid, do you know the way outta here? Does anybody? I'm the only one who knows the way outta here. So, that puts me in charge. You in charge? Nah, that's bullshit. We follow chain of command around here. Griffin's in charge. - Fuck your chain of command! Where's that gotten you so far? Half your squad's dead... I wouldn't do that if I were you. Why? What will I find? - Oh, shit. - Drop your weapon. - Drop it now! - Stand down. Stand down all of you. (Tagger speaking foreign language) What the fuck, what is he saying? Listen, son of a bitch, you're gonna put an end to all that alpha male horseshit. You're gonna take orders and you're gonna fall in line. Now, is that understood or are we gonna have a problem? Oh, I like her. What do you think, Reid? All those in favor of candy ass being in charge. Look, you smug asshole, you ain't getting command. Well, sugar-tits, if you really think that, then I suggest you prove it and pull the trigger. You know what? It doesn't matter. Just had to open up lines of communication. That could a gone better. For a moment there I thought you were gonna do something. I don't like him. We move out in 10. You know, I didn't think it was gonna be like this. I mean, we're- - Fucked, man. Dominguez. We'll be all right, man. We'll make it outta this. I mean, why? Why do we gotta be trapped in a cave? Why can't we be trapped in a penthouse suite in Vegas. You know? With a bunch of hot-ass strippers. Man, that shit just doesn't happen in real life. I guess not. Yeah, what do you think he has in all those crates? (Lake sighs) I don't know. It could be anything. [Tagger] All right, ladies. Make sure you're loaded up 'cause we're not coming back. Dude, look at all this shit, man. Got everything. (Paine chuckling) - Hell yeah. - Really? You're gonna be a stereotype and grab a samurai sword? Got any nunchucks for you? Maybe a calculator? You ever been cut, homes? Homes? Now this shit is badass. (Paine chuckling) Man. Jesus, what do these guys not have? Patience, so hurry the fuck up. Listen up, I'm only gonna say this once. Caves are dangerous. There's a possibility of claustrophobia, panic attacks, and hallucinations. So, we're gonna move in two-by-two formations, steady pace. Keep your eye on your partner at all times. And I mean all fuckin' times. If one of you needs to take a piss, the other one holds it. Clear? You and Lake take the lead. Reid and I will take the trail. We stop and go when I say so. Do as you're told and you will see sunlight again. How long till we get the fuck outta here? Three or four hours tops. Anything else? All right, pack up, move out. Fuck, this shit's too heavy. (Paine chuckling) - Yeah, man. Earlier when I asked you, you said you didn't know if there was another way out. Well, a lot's changed since then. Then why did you tell him three or four hours? Figured I'd keep him from asking me for a while. Besides if we're not out by then, we're not getting out. (Reid sighs) (light eerie music) Whoa. Ah, doesn't this place remind you of one of those haunted mazes? You know, like the ones they have at Halloween where it's all like dark and shit? And you know at any moment something's just gonna reach out- (Sullivan grunts) (dramatic music) Why'd I get stuck with you as my partner? Hey, Dominguez. - What? We're switching partners. You got Sullivan. All right. What up, Dominguez? I don't know what his problem was back there. I didn't say nothin'. I'm sure you didn't. These tunnels look like they were dug out. Almost like they were man made or something. It's 'cause they were. The Afghan dug 'em out during the Soviet War. Drove the Russians so crazy, they got bogged down, and it's long drawn out. Collapsed their entire economy. US was even, well, we were passing out weapons underneath the rug to Afghanistan. You know what I don't understand though? If Tagger really knows the way out, then why does he have us leading? Probably to protect whatever's in those crates. He didn't want none of us to go back and check 'em out. 'Cause you bet your bottom dollar, I'd be the first one to crack 'em open. Don't even think about it. What do you mean, "Don't even think about it?" We've been planning this heist for over a year, and now we're walking away from the biggest payday ever, and you don't want me to think about it? Right now, step three is the crates. First, we have to take care of steps one and step two. So, what's step one? [Tagger] Get outta this god forsaken cave. [Reid] All right, so what's step two? I'll tell you when we finish step one. You know, you can be a real pain sometimes. Sometimes? I must be slipping. (light eerie music) Did I tell you I hate these fuckin' caves? [Chen] Me too. How's your neck, man? [Chen] It's fine. We thought, we really thought we lost you back there, man. You was outta there. Glad you're okay. Let's get up outta this hellhole. (ominous music) (Karnoctus growling) [Sullivan] All right, all right. Mary Poppins or Princess Leah in her slave outfit? [Dominguez] Mary Poppins, I like my house clean. Yes, like the way you think. Huntress or Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman. I'll tie her ass up with that magic lasso of hers. (Sullivan chuckling) All right, I'm gonna throw a curve ball at ya. Mystique or Power Girl? Mystique. It doesn't matter what you say. She can be anyone she wants, rather she can be anyone I want. And you just won the bonus round, my friend. Congratulations, Johnny, tell him what he's won. A way out of this fucking cave. God, you're an idiot. (bug hissing) - Holy shit! - What? Oh, my God, I totally just saw something run... Oh, my God! (bug hissing) I just felt something from below. [Dominguez] There's nothing there, man. There's totally something here, dude. I'm seeing a whole bunch of shit around. Oh, my God, that's a big ass fuckin'- (dramatic music) (Sullivan screaming) Holy shit! - Shit, man. What the hell's happening over here? Spiders, man, spiders. - The thing is fucking- - They're fuckin' everywhere. - Where? - They're all over the place. You're freaking out a little. - He went up towards- - It's a giant spider. Pay attention, there's a giant spider! (soldiers yelling over each other) Ah, shit. Oh, shit. Dude, no lie, there's a big ass fuckin' camel spider on your back. Sullivan, don't fuckin' move, man. (Sullivan gasping) - Oh, shit. - Get it off me, guys. Please get it off me. - I'm not touchin' that shit. Guys, please get it off, get it off, get it off. - Dude, dude. - Dude, get off me! - Don't touch me! - Get off me, get off me! Get it the fuck off me! Get it off! What are you doin', get get it off! (rifle butt thudding) (spider squeaking) (knife thudding) Oh, my God. I think it bit me, it bit me. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna fucking die. Calm down, bitch. Shit's not even poisonous. What, how do you know? Oh, for Christ's sake. Have you seen that spider before? Do they run around in your backyard? No, they... Oh, my God. Guys, I'm feeling dizzy. Oh, my God. Really bad headache. - Oh, here we go. (Sullivan panting) You're not even bit. Fuckin' moron. - Man up. - Are you sure? Are you sure? - Come on, get up. Get up! Let's go. - Fuck, man. Dude, it's just spiders. Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, just spiders, you know? Just your everyday daddy long leg walking through the garden. (Reid whispering) All right, take five. Stay hydrated. If you need to take a piss, do it now. (Reid whispering) - Wait, what? You want us to take a break in this spider infested area? You think, you really think that's a good idea? Oh, man, you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? Yeah, if you're thinking Gunnar really picked a fucked up cave for us to hole up in, then yeah. Yeah, they think they were ambushed by the Taliban. Yeah, I know. I heard 'em, I know. How do you tell a platoon of US soldiers that half their squad just got gunned down by a CIA-supported terrorist group that's in the middle of robbing a country? (Tagger sighs) You know, the Buddha taught that the past and the future are just delusions and the only thing that exists is the now. And right now, we're fucked. - You know? - Yeah. If I didn't know any better, I'd think you were worried. Does anyone else think this is a stupid idea? I mean, those things could be all around us right now. Uh, how's that spider bite holding up? How'd that work out for ya? Did your nuts go numb yet? (Lake laughing) Oh, I'm bit, I'm bit. You're not even bit. Oh, God, I love you guys so much. [Tagger] Glad to see everyone's spirit's up. We're just letting off a little steam. I think we've earned it. Think you've earned it? You haven't earned shit. (Reid chuckling) Here we go. You have no fucking clue. You're just pawns for foreign policy. Hell, 20 years ago, I was just like you. Oh, what, you sell out? What, you think you're over here defending liberty and spreading democracy? You have no idea why you're here. I can explain it all in five words. Monetary policy controls foreign policy. If America wants to keep having the lifestyle that it's used to, (Karnoctus grumbling) Then it has to force other countries to keep accepting its fiat paper. And if they don't, well, Washington sends in good little soldiers like you to bomb the fuck out of 'em. (Reid chuckling) - Yeah, sounds like a load of conspiracy bullshit to me, huh? The Federal Reserve is a private corporation that controls the money supply to the world. And you don't think it's at all plausible that they bought off governments? (Karnoctus grumbling) Political system's bought off. The judicial system is bought off. And you're just here to keep the charade going as long as possible till they can squeeze every last asset out of the market before the whole scam collapses. It's capitalism, man. That's why everything's so fucked up. No, no, no, no, we don't have anything close to capitalism. If you want a free market, you have to have honest money. And right now, there's government regulation and interference on every fucking level of business. That's not capitalism. That's crony capitalism. The banks own the politicians. The politicians pass laws that favor the banks. And the voters, they get to vote for candidates preselected by the banks. (Reid chuckling) The only real law that exists is bribes, payoffs, and corruption. Well, I gotta take a piss. Come on, Dominguez. Tagger says you gotta hold my dick. Move out. (Karnoctus growling) So, what'd you think of all that back there? I wanna get out this cave, that's what I think about that. (light eerie music) What is that? It's human. Oh, what! What is that? I don't know, it looks like something was eating him. - Huh. - Yeah, sure does, man. What is that? (lighter clicking) He won't be missing it. Hey, guys? Uh, eaten by what? His weapon's spent. Look, there's shells all over the place. [Griffin] Yeah, he was unloading on something. [Lake] But how could you miss so many times in such a small- - Hey, guys. I found another one over here. (light eerie music) (Tagger sighs) There are no shells here. Whatever got this guy got him by surprise. Maybe a bear or something? Bear? Nah, man. No, not a bear, man. Bears are not in this area. What are you a zoologist? How about a cougar? Maybe a mountain lion or something? So, uh, so, let me get a grasp on this guys, because I don't think I'm fully understanding. We are A: trapped in a cave, B: getting hunted down by huge ass spiders, and C: something that apparently likes the taste of human flesh. That isn't good I don't think that's good. You know, there really ought to be a limit to how bad days could get, guys. Because we would be maxed out right about now. We don't even know if the animal that did this is still around. [Griffin] Yeah, I'm sure it's long gone by now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying. Hey, guys. You're not gonna believe what I just found. Ah, great. You know, if it's another dead body, count me out. It's not bodies. You gotta see this. (eerie music) Looks like some kinda drug lab. Hm, now we know what they were doing here. Who'd put a drug lab this far in a cave? Two dead guys. There's a generator. See if you can get it started. I'm on it. If this is a drug lab, where's all the drugs? [Griffin] Maybe it's a weapons lab? The generator's empty. Try to find some gasoline, see if we can get it running again. All right, everyone, let's spread out now. Find some fuel. [Dominguez] Oh, sweet. [Sullivan] Yo, Dominguez. I am your father. (Sullivan humming) No, you're an idiot. Dude, do you wanna get outta here or not? (canister clanking) (gas hissing) (Sullivan coughing) Damn! - Oh, oh. - What am I smelling? Oh, boy, what's that smell now? [Chen] Sullivan opened a canister. - Well, close it. - Oh, worst fuckin' smell I've ever experienced, man. Sherlock here opened up one of the canisters. Nobody opens up anything without asking me first. - My eyes are burning. - It only makes sense to put a lab this far in if it was between two entrances. You know, like, to vent it for air. (shelving clanking) That was me. It's my bad. I'll fix it. - All right, listen up. We're gonna maintain the same pace, but a tight formation. Reid and I are gonna take the lead, followed by Griffin, Dominguez. Paine and Chen, you take our trail. [Reid] I know that look, what's going on? Lake was right, they wouldn't have put a lab this far in if there wasn't another entrance. They were using to vent for air. - Oh, so you think there's- - I think the chances of us getting outta here just doubled. (Karnoctus grumbling) (ominous music) (Karnoctus grumbling) Griffin, we're moving out. Let's go. You all right, man? - Yeah, I'm good. Let's do it. (dramatic music) (Karnoctus growling) You know what, Sullivan? You remind me of a babe. What? Never mind. [Paine] You know, I don't like Tagger and I don't like Ace. Yeah, who fuckin' does? [Paine] Yeah, well, what's the first thing you're gonna do when you get outta here? Find myself a couple of big booty hoes. (Paine chuckling) [Paine] Man, you need to come to Chicago with me, where the finest women be at. [Chen] Some nice ladies there? [Paine] Man, you should see my girl. She's fine. (Karnoctus grumbling) Did you hear that? - (sighs) What? - Thought I heard something. It sounded like growling. It's probably just your stomach, man. - Nah, man. - Dude, we gotta keep moving. [Paine] I know I heard something. [Chen] Paine, come on. We need to stick together. (suspenseful music) Man, could a sworn I heard something. (Karnoctus growling) (Paine screaming) Paine? Paine? Paine! Paine! Paine! - Chen, man, what the fuck? What happened? - What's wrong? - I don't know. - Paine! Something took Paine, he was standing- Where's Paine? Did you see him? - Paine! - Did he go down that way? - Paine! I thought I told you to stay together? - We were, he was right there! - Paine! Hey, buddy, listen to me. (Chen panting) Did you see anything? Did you see what took him? - No, no. Come on, we gotta go find him. Lake, you stick with the squad. Griffin and I are going back. - I'm going with you. - Come on! - Paine! - Paine! - Oh, shit. (Chen panting) - Paine! - Slow down. We have to hurry, now come on! Paine! - Hey, kid, slow down. Paine, he could be just right up there. Just right around the bend! You don't know who took Paine. We could be walking into a trap. Now, I need you to stay calm- - Guys? - And keep your head in the game. - Hey, guys! Look. (eerie music) What is that? Dude, how does Paine just get snatched like that and Chen not see a damn thing? No freaking way. I know, right? They're like right next to each other. You think one of 'em would see the other one getting snatched. - A way out. - What? There's a way out. - What? - Right there. You see the light? - No. - There's a way out, dude. - No, there's nothing there. Look, look, look, look, look at the light. - There's nothing there. - It's right there. We can get outta here, dude (chuckling). Come on. [Dominguez] You crazy idiot, there's nothing over there, man. How do you not see it? It's right here. - How do you see anything? There's nothing there. [Lake] What's going on over here? I dunno, he's crazy. He says he sees a way out. - I'm getting us outta here. - A way out, where? - Right here. - Nowhere, man. - Come on. What is wrong with him? [Lake] Guys, he's, he's hallucinating. - Come here. - Come on, help me out, guys. - Pull him. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Pull him, back. You're coming back, buddy. - Wait, wait, wait, wait- - Listen, listen. There's nothing there. [Chen] He's right, man, there's nothing there. No, there is. Would you just look? Look- - Sullivan, hey. Look at me, okay, look at me. All right, you're hallucinating. If you would just turn around and see that there's a light. Coming out of the wall- - Hey, hey! - We could get the fuck out of here! - Calm down! (fist thudding) (Lake panting) Now, two things can happen here. We don't have time for this shit! So, I can keep hitting you, okay? Or you can snap out of it. Yeah? He's back. Get him up. - There was, there was... - No, no. - It was right there. - There was nothing there. There was nothing. - Let him go, guys. - No, I- - Hey, hey. - I'm not, I wasn't lying. - It'll be all right. - There was a light coming- - It's okay. Just sit down, come on. Just sit down. All right, you're gonna be fine. Just breathe. Guys, let's give him some space. He needs some air. It's gonna be all right. (Lake panting) You know, you unleashed quite a smack down on Sullivan over there. You know, I may get to hallucinating a little bit. If I do, maybe just give me a light slap, okay? Or better yet, how about a safe word? Tea bag, how's that? What's taking them so long? (upbeat dance music) (Sullivan moaning) Sullivan? Yeah? Sullivan! (water splashing) (Sullivan spitting) Sullivan, hey, hey, hey, hey! What, what (panting)? Calm down. Oh, no, no, no. Oh, oh, come on, man. They were right there. The titties were out and they were in my face. She was about to show me. - Hey! - You're hallucinating again. - Where's Paine? We didn't find him. We found a rifle with a lot of blood. What does that mean? We found the footprint of some kind of animal. No, whatever it is, it's big. You didn't find a body, right? Which means he can still be alive! We don't know, but we're gonna go back. No, we're not going back. He could be alive. You know if this happened to either one of you, that you would go back. Right? (Tagger sighs) All right, we'll go back. But don't expect good news. [Lake] Griffin, what is it? - You guys don't see him? - Who? There's no one there. - What do you see? Otti, is that you? Good to see you, lad. Hey, grandpa. Hey, let's go fishing. I've got bait, tackle, all the stuff. Hey, buddy. There's no one there, okay? Hey, you're just hallucinating all right? [Griffin] I see my grandpa, my grandpa is right there, I was... He's standing right there, look at him. I need you to stay with me, all right? The canisters. That smell inside. [Lake] What about the smell? When you opened the canisters, whatever it was inside is causing... Did anyone else see something unusual? Something out of the ordinary? - No. - No. [Dominguez] Well, I didn't, I didn't wanna say anything, but- - What? - Lake. (dramatic music) Your uniform is uh... Is what? Well, what is it? [Dominguez] It looks good. Looks good. (hand slapping) And how does it look now? It still looks good. Hallucinations would explain Sullivan, Griffin and Dominguez. [Chen] Well I smelled it too. How come I'm not hallucinating? Yeah, if it was the canister, then shouldn't we all be hallucinating? Or no, that would depend on a couple different factors, like body mass, inhalation- Did anyone not smell the canisters? I think we all smelled it. - Yeah. - Wait a minute, no. Look, look at his eyes. Ah, shit. Lake, look after Griffin. Dominguez, Chen, keep an eye on Sullivan. Hopefully this shit'll soon pass. We'll take a 10 minute break and then we'll move out. [Dominguez] Come on, man. [Sullivan] Oh, you gotta be fuckin' kidding me, man. Come on, man, I still gotta take a piss, man. You wanna go out there? You really think that's a good idea? I don't think that's a good idea. If you think that's a good idea that's fine, but I'm staying right here. Look, if I gotta piss, I'm gonna piss. I'm gonna piss my pants and I don't care. Now, you can come and join me, and sit down, and have a nice, relaxing moment. Instead of going out there and getting snatched up! Never mind, man. I don't have to go that bad. Yeah, you're damn right. (urine trickling) Dude, did you just, did you just really piss just now? I told you. (speaking foreign language), man. Damn! Hey, hold up. Listen, if we all start hallucinating, this is gonna get real ugly, real quick. Vega wouldn't go into the cave. What? Vega refused to go inside the cave. He said there was some demon or beast that dwelled inside. Something the locals call... Called what? - Karnoctus, I don't know. - Karnoctus? - I wasn't paying attention. - Are you serious? Look, I thought he was full of it like you said. Wait, what are you saying? You're saying there's some sort of Afghani Sasquatch down here? I don't know, but after seeing that footprint. Guys? Hey, guys! (light eerie music) Tell me I'm hallucinating. [Lake] Oh, my God. - So you see 'em too? - Bone graveyard. Yeah, we see it. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Come on! (maggots squishing) Where's Griffin? [Lake] He went with Dominguez. From now on everybody stay together. Understood? - Okay, I'll go get 'em. - Take Sullivan with you. - Come on, Sully. Yeah, yeah, that's uh, that's a good plan. Just gonna leave all these bodies. What do you make of all this? Some kind of den for a pack of animals. Yeah, or one really big one. (light eerie music) Have you ever seen anything like this? Uh-uh, it looks like some sort of saber tooth. Where's Chen? (light eerie music) (air whooshing) Hello? Hello? (Paine screaming) Paine, is that you? Hey, talk to me, bro. [Paine] Help, help! Paine, Paine! Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's me, Chen. Hey, what happened? Oh, some fucking creature grabbed me. It's fine, it's fine. It's me, I'm here, okay? - I don't wanna die here. - The guys are coming. - I don't wanna die in this cave. - We're not gonna die. No one's gonna die. (Paine groaning) Gonna get you home, okay? The guys are coming and we're gonna get you home. (Paine gasping) Stay with me, Paine! Stay with me! I'ma patch you up, just I'll get you home. I'll get you, I'll carry you. (Karnoctus grumbling) (Chen panting) (ominous music) Paine? Paine! (Karnoctus grumbling) What's going on, man? (Karnoctus screeching) Paine! (Chen panting) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (Karnoctus growling) (Chen screaming) (paw slamming) (Karnoctus roaring) (Chen screaming) (gravel crunching) Watch my six. (light eerie music) (flesh squishing) (ominous music) (Karnoctus growling) (Karnoctus screeching) What the fuck! What was that? - Oh, oh, oh, my God. [Sullivan] Huh? (Lake gasping) - Is that Chen? - Oh, my God. Oh, my. (Lake whimpering) Oh, Jesus. - Oh, God. (Dominguez coughing) (vomit splashing) - Ow, yo, I saw it. - Yeah, we all saw it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, somebody needs to tell me I'm hallucinating right the fuck now 'cause this shit can't be happening. Oh, yeah, just, you're just gonna need to breathe. Fuck breathing. You look at that and breathe! (Dominguez groaning) You keep your eye on this cavern. You see anything move, you unload your mag, understood? (Dominguez gagging) Understood? Yes, yes, yes. Jesus Christ. (Lake gasping) Oh, oh, God. (dramatic music) This thing's hunting us down. Oh, you think? What gave it away? Paine's disappearance or what, what it just... No, no, no, no, no, man, we gotta get outta here. No, we gotta go. We just, we just gotta, we just gotta run our asses off. No, no, if we run, we give whatever this thing is the advantage. We need to keep our heads straight. What do you suggest? We set a trap for it. And then kill it. - Oh, sure, trap. Yeah, why the hell didn't I think of that? Oh, maybe because it's a fucking thing with teeth! No, no, no, no, man. We need to sprint and don't look back. If we can lure it to where we want. Lure it with what? Are you seeing what I'm seeing? This is my friend. - That's it. We use the body. Are you suggesting we use Chen's body for bait? Yeah, we can spread out. When that thing returns- - We can what? Just watch it eat Chen? I'm trying to prevent that from happening to the rest of us. This is Chen. Now, I say we put a grenade in Chen's body, and when it comes back and moves Chen, boom. (suspenseful music) You touch one hair on his head, and I kill you. - Sullivan, Sullivan- - I'll kill him right here. - Calm down, brother. - Sully, don't do this. We need you to stay calm. All right? - Sullivan, listen to me. - Uh huh. - Listen to me. Now, we're all scared here. Okay, we're all scared. He's just talking, he's just talking. I'm talking, man. Look at me, man. I'm talking. Sullivan, we need to get this thing before it gets a hold of anything else. And Tagger's right, this might be our only shot. Put the weapon away. [Sullivan] He wants to put a grenade in Chen. He's just trying to help us, all right? (Sullivan crying) Listen, whatever that thing is out there, it's hunting us down and we need to take it out all right? Listen to me. No one's gonna touch Chen's body, all right? No grenade, I promise. We're gonna surround and wait for that thing to return. And when it does, you're gonna help us light that fucker up, all right? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay? I say we hit this thing with everything we've got. We take this bag of explosives, and we put it next to the body. [Griffin] No, no explosives. [Tagger] You forget who's in charge? Look where that's gotten us so far. An explosion could cause another cave-in. I know you think you know what you're doing, but trust me, now is not the time to go soft. I say we hit this thing with everything we've got. We hit it hard. You're not putting a grenade in Chen. - Fuck. - This is crazy! Look at us! We're sitting here being hunted by whatever the fuck that thing is, and we're sitting here pointing our guns at each other! Griffin, lower your weapon now! Tagger, we're not planting explosives anywhere near Chen's body. We're gonna do just like Griffin said, we're gonna pair up in two, we're gonna surround the body. When that godforsaken thing turn- We send it straight to hell. You're making a big mistake. You're about to learn, sometimes it's not doing what you wanna do, it's about doing what needs to be done. (light eerie music) (glow sticks clicking) (glow sticks thudding) Every heist needs a plan. Ours was simple. Steal the crates, stash them in the cave, and fly out in a chopper. But of all the caves in all the world, we had to pick the one with a fuckin' Afghani Sasquatch. You think this is gonna work? (Sullivan sniffles) (soccer ball thudding) Oh, oh, my God. What? - Everything all right, man? (Dominguez sighs) It's my son. He's right there. - What? - He's right there. Nobody's there, dude. I see it, he's right there. (Dominguez sniffling) Real soon, I'm, I'm gonna come home real soon. Hey, hey, hey, no, no, no, man. Something's going on over there with Dominguez and Sullivan. They're gonna have to deal with it. Yeah, I know. - Hey, look at me. - I know, I know, it's not. Hey, hey, (speaking foreign language). No, no, no, no, no, hey, man. - I got it, I got it. - You can't look at him, dude. (Dominguez hushes) I got it, I got it, just relax. Hey, (speaking foreign language), listen. (eerie music) I need you, I need you to do something for me, okay? I need you to go uh, go find mom. Okay and then uh, tell her... Tell her how beautiful she is. Go, go tell her now. Okay, daddy. (eerie music) [Dominguez] Just go (sniffling). You okay, man? (Dominguez sighs) Are you back? (Dominguez sighs) I need you to be back for me, man. Yeah, yeah, I'm back. (Karnoctus growling) (dramatic music) (body thudding) (Dominguez groans) (gunshots banging) (Karnoctus grunting) (gunshots banging) (Sullivan yelling) [Sullivan] Oh, God (panting). Oh, shit. Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no. (Sullivan panting) (Sullivan screaming) (flesh squishing) (suspenseful music) (Sullivan screaming) (Karnoctus growling) (light dramatic music) What kinda blood glows? There's a trail. We could track it. You all right? (Lake panting) - You tried to warn us. - Yeah, I didn't want this. Go kill that son of a bitch. [Reid] Tag, let's go. Oh, we're getting out of this, man. No, no, no, man. Tell me where it hurts, huh. Did you, did you do it? Hey, hey, hey, hey. You tell me, you tell me what to do now, huh. Tell me what to do. And what did she say? Come on, (gagging). Come on, let's go, let's go find, let's go find her together. (Dominguez coughing) You go find her. (somber music) Yeah, man, you go, you go find her. (light eerie music) (blood trickling) (Karnoctus growling) (Reid screaming) (Tagger groaning) Man, I'm gonna mount that thing's head on the wall. (Tagger chuckling) You'll be all right. Just a scratch, right? Yeah, it's just a scratch. Let's go kill that thing. Then I'll help you mount it on the wall. (Reid groans) (light eerie music) (Karnoctus growling) (dramatic music) (head squishing) (gunshots banging) (Karnoctus shrieking) (suspenseful music) (Tagger panting) (Tagger grunting) (Tagger yelling) (Karnoctus growling) (dramatic music) (flesh squishing) (Karnoctus shrieking) (Tagger panting) (Karnoctus grumbling) (Karnoctus growling) (paws pounding) (light eerie music) (flare hissing) (Karnoctus grumbling) (Karnoctus growling) No, don't, don't touch it! Don't touch it. (gravel crunching) (suspenseful music) (Griffin panting) (dramatic music) (Tagger gasps) (Tagger groaning) Where's Reid? How are the others? (Tagger groaning) - Your shoulder's dislocated. - Yeah, pop it back in. I'll reset it for you. - Go. - You ready? Just man the fuck up and- (shoulder popping) Across your chest. (Tagger groaning) Bring it across your chest. And tell me you killed that thing? (Tagger chuckling) It set a trap for us with its own blood. If it's not dead we need to get moving, all right? We need to roll outta here. - I set a trap of my own. (Tagger cackling) He touches Reid, ooh, fuckin' boom. Yeah, boom (cackling). Tagger, can you get on, can you get to your feet? Do you wanna know what was in those crates? Crates, what? Listen, you're in shock right now. The crates, you wanted to know? [Griffin] Tagger, you're in shock right now, okay? - Yeah, no, no, no, no, no. - Focus. Get your shit together. - No, fuck shock. I need you to listen to me. If I don't make it outta here (panting), I want you to have this. We're gonna make it outta here, okay? We're gonna be all right. - Here. I need, I need you to get on your feet. We need to move. - I'm not moving until you take this! - Okay. - That's what's in the crates. You understand? - Yes. - Say you understand. - I understand. - Say you under- - I understand! Now, let's roll! (Tagger chuckling) I'm waiting on you, let's go. (Griffin groaning) (Lake whimpering) Is this too fast? - No, it's oh... Oh, oh, okay. Come on. (Tagger groaning) (Tagger panting) (Lake panting) Look, there's wires. - What? Huh? This place is wired. Tagger, the cave's wired! You sit tight. It looks like, there's a generator over here! The lights are used for entrances. What is that? (generator squeaking) You bitch! (generator rattling) (generator rumbling) (Griffin chuckling) (Lake laughing) Yeah! Tagger! Tagger, come on, let's move that candy ass! (Lake laughing) (cave rumbling) What was, what was that? It's Tagger, it's Tagger's trap down there. You killed it! You got it, Tagger, come on. Come on, we're almost outta here! I'm right behind you. I'm with you, you're doing good. All right, we're gonna make it. We're almost there. The light. Look, there's the light! - Woo-hoo-hoo! - It's the light! - Tagger! We're gonna make it, baby! (Karnoctus growling) (light bulbs shattering) (dramatic music) Tagger! Get her outta here! Keep moving, go, go! - Are you all right? - Yeah. A little faster. (flare popping) (flare hissing) (Karnoctus growling) Why don't you just fucking die? (Karnoctus growling) Come on! (Karnoctus hissing) (flare popping) (flare hissing) (Karnoctus growling) I'm gonna cut your balls off and use 'em as my door knocker. (Tagger clicking) (Karnoctus growling) (dramatic music) (Karnoctus growling) (Tagger groaning) (fist thudding) (Tagger grunting) (Karnoctus growling) (paw thudding) (Tagger groaning) (Tagger panting) (Karnoctus roaring) (suspenseful music) What are you waiting for? (Tagger chuckling) (Karnoctus growling) (gunshots banging) Shoot the backpack! Do it now! (gunshots banging) (Karnoctus groaning) (explosion booming) (light dramatic music) (Griffin gasping) (Griffin groaning) (wind howling) (gravel rustling) [Tagger Voice over] Do you wanna know what was in those crates? You wanted to know? Do you wanna know what was in those crates? You wanted to know? Do you wanna know what was in those crates? You wanted to know? That's what's in the crates. (light dramatic music) (Tagger gasping) (Karnoctus growling) (Tagger groaning) (Karnoctus shrieking) (dagger thudding) (dramatic music) (Karnoctus' grumbling) (ominous music) Really?
