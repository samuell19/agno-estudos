We've hit the shoulder lane-- Hey, Olive, don't fucking drive at all. Are you out of your mind? Well, first of all, I hope your acting is going to be a little bit better than that on your second Batman audition. Oh my God. Oh my God I swear to God, if you... you know how hard I worked for you to get this fucking meeting? Do you have any idea? Do not fuck this up over a pair of tits in nice clothes.

Yup, I'm about to be there now. -What are you doing? -Fuck fuck fuck! I'm supposed to be at that meeting! Go to the meeting. Fuck love. Go be Batman. I'm not losing her over this acting job.

She-- [laughs] Did she say where she was going? Yeah, you know what, she-- [laughs] Okay okay okay... All right... Your dad's dead. Actually that works for both of us. [laughing] It used to only work for me. I'm so sorry. Wasn't thinking there. I can make anybody famous. I can do fucking anything. Joaquin Phoenix, no one would hire him. He had half a face. I made that happen. Adam Sandler? They called me about Uncut Gems. It was initially about circumcision. Okay? I made them change it. Adam Sandler went from silly fucking goose to genius guy in Uncut Gems. That's why I don't have Instagram cause I'd just be looking at butts all day. Big fat butts. Anyways, you guys should try a finger in your ass. It's pretty fun. I wouldn't like, you know, start with it but you could finish with it. Oh, wow. Was there a flash sale at Hot Topic? We'll take a booth. Or anything but a booth. [laughs] Take anything but a booth. [laughs] Okay. We don't want a booth. But you want a booth. I can't help you. We'll take a booth. We went to the wrong restaurant. Let's go. God damn it. You guys decide what you want? And don't take long cause I've got a big part tomorrow. I'm playing a Bush in the new Leonardo DiCaprio film. Hm? Congratulations to me. Correct. Yeah. That's right. Hey! My agent said this was gonna be an easy gig! You didn't even give me shoes! Hey! I'm an A-list player, homes. I don't play this stuff. What is this? What am I supposed to be? A cave man! Hey! I'm outta here. I'm changing my clothes. Hey, do you know where you can go, eh? Go to hell. Right, everybody take a nice deep breath. -[coughs] -You all right? Okay, you sure? You need like a Luden's? You guys got a Luden's? [laughs] It was taken from the bedroom-- Why'd you park so fucking far? Does anybody here have any X? -You're hanging with us! -Yes! Woo! Fuck that deeb, dude, he's gone, man! Fuck him! I can still hear every word you all are saying. You're mic'd. It's a movie. [laughs] You should give me your number after this scene. -What? -Nothing. Did you just ask me to give you my number? [whispers] No. What did you say then? Because it sounded like "you should give me your number after this." No, I said I need a cucumber for me eyes. You do have really dark bags under your eyes. Fuck you. Action! Action! -Man, what the fuck! -Action! [coughing] I'm forgetting the first line thing again. Let me...one more time, what'd you say? [giggles] ♪ I gotta smoke something for this ♪ ♪ ♪ Am I not in this scene? Sorry, man. [laughs] Why are you even awake right now? Why are you even up--I'm sorry, I'm thrown off by that ringtone. Can we not have Britney Spears ringtones go off? Quiet all around. Hold, plane. Yes she just left like two minutes ago. You wanna do your walking any louder? That'd be good. I know I wanted to be Batman, but [birds singing] maybe... I wanna be Birdman. [laughs] So I can get these things shut the fuck up. Make sure that keeps making noise [truck beeping] I fucking hate you, you fucking cement mixer. [loud car passes] [car alarm goes off] Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, I hate you, ahhhhh! [laughs] He's taking a shower. [laughs] Holding for garbage. The giantest garbage truck I've ever fucking seen! Like, just weave, you gotta weave through-- Car: What would you like to-- Hold on, sorry, this car's yelling at me. Fuck. Shit. Sorry. You know what? She's just...it's her first day. -Mm-hm. -There's um... Car: What can I do for you? C-3PO's going crazy. R2D2's going... Guys, that's my IUD. [thud] What is that? This whole movie is just me looking over my shoulder every second going, "what is that?" [screaming] Ahh fuck! Fuck! [screaming] ♪ ♪ Cut. Let's reset. I'm just kidding. That's a wrap. That lobster is not talking to you. My God. Imagine believing that a lobster can talk. Oh you think you big huh? There you go. Help yourself to that. [finger crunching] [screams] You're a big fucking stoner. Get over here. Try it. [growls] Get in here. Get in here. Ha ha! I got you! [electric shock] [screams] Dip me and I will kick your ass. Bro, this motherfucker's still talking shit. I'm talking shit? I'm about to boil your ass, bro. Oh, dip me deeper, dip me deeper. Oh, hot demons. Man, bon appe-tight, my brothas. Man, you did all that prep for this shrimpy-ass lobster? What you mean? Bro, this is a limp shrimp biscuit bro? Now you all talking shit, bro. I'm gonna take all this shit. That's a wrap! [screams] [applause] [machines beeping] And cut! That is a wrap on season two finale of Good Bad People. Let's hear it for our actors. Stop that, please. Hold up. [British accent] Is that our fucking finale? Can you be a little bit more professional? -Thanks. -Piss off. So glad this is over. So you're telling me London Clash goes through all of this in the course of one fucking day because of a text message with a typo? He's auditioning to become Batman. He gets high and sends his mate to the meeting and still gets the job. What is he? The luckiest cunt in the world? His stalker saves his life. Leo breaks not one, but three urns with his girlfriend's family in it and his solution is to fill it up with weed ashes. This is the worst ending I've ever seen. You were at the table read. Get me out of this. You're all wankers. Fuck! Why am I limping?
