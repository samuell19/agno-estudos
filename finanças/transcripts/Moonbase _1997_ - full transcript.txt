THIS IS BULL ! TOOK THAT WELL. DANA LOOKED GOOD. I DIDN'T NOTICE. YEAH, I NOTICED HOW YOU DIDN'T NOTICE. IT'S IN THE PAST. LET'S JUST LEAVE IT. LAST TIME YOU LOOKED THAT STUNNED WAS WHEN I DRUG YOU IN OFF THE SURFACE HALF DEAD. DON'T START WITH ME, WILL. HOW CAN I START WITH YOU ? YOU STILL HAVEN'T FINISHED WITH HER.

HE'LL KEEP TO HIMSELF. TRUST ME, JOHN KNOWS THE SCORE. HE WON'T BE A PROBLEM. MAYBE. HE'S HAD QUITE SOME TIME TO RECONSIDER HIS POSITION. HE MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT PUT HIM UP THERE. WELL, THEN MAYBE HE NEEDS A REMINDER. MISS MORGAN, I'VE READ YOUR BACKGROUND. I'M IMPRESSED. I'VE READ YOURS AND I'M NOT.IT WASN'T MEANT TO IMPRESS YOU. OR INFORM ME.IT'S A SENSITIVE SITUATION. THE DISKS WERE MARKED FOR DESTRUCTION, NOT DISPOSAL. YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S ON THEM. YOU JUST NEED TO HELP ME FIND THEM. EXCUSE ME ?THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE IN PLANS. YOU'LL BE ACCOMPANYING ME ON THE SHUTTLE.MURDOCH ASSIGNED KRUTCHFIELD. AND I REQUESTED YOU INSTEAD. YOU CO-DESIGNED THE COMPOUND'S COMPUTER SYSTEM, AND I BELIEVE YOUR PAST ASSOCIATION WITH JOHN RUSSELL COULD BE USEFUL. PAST ASSOCIATION ?ON THE TEAM THAT OVERSAW WTI'S ARCTIC PLANT. THAT WAS OVER FIVE YEARS AGO. IT WASN'T EXACTLY A SUCCESS. BUT YOU SURVIVED THE CORPORATE AFTERMATH. I WAS ASSURED YOU WERE A TEAM PLAYER. THE CHOICE, OF COURSE, IS YOURS. FINE.

[ Sighs ] DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, LUCAS. THE FIRST TIME ON THE MOON CAN SHAKE THE BEST OF US UP. YEAH ? SURE. NEIL ARMSTRONG. I BET YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT HIS FIRST WORDS WERE WHEN HE STEPPED ON THIS ROCK. [ Lucas ] YEAH. "ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN." HIS VERY FIRST WORDS WERE, "CONGRATULATIONS, MR. GORSKY." WHO'S MR. GORSKY ?EXACTLY. NASA DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND OF IT, SO THEY DELETED IT FROM THE TRANSMISSION-- WILL. IF I HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS STORY ONE MORE TIME, I SWEAR I'M GONNA GO NUTS ! THE ARMSTRONG STORY ? IT'S MY BEST ONE. SO, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM ? NOTHIN', REALLY. I HAD A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP. HE'S GOT THE SHAKES. ARTI-ZONE MUST'VE DRIED ON HIS SUIT. I'M OKAY, REALLY. WE'RE SLIPPIN' INTO LUNAR NIGHT. IT SHOULD GET PRETTY COLD. IT'S GOIN' DOWN TO ABOUT 150 BELOW. MAYBE YOU'D BETTER KEEP HIM IN. IT'S UP TO HIM. HE SAYS HE'S OKAY. THE LOAD FROM L4 PASSES OVER THE DROP ZONE IN 45 MINUTES. LET'S GET READY TO ROLL OUT. [ Masani ] DROP ZONE IS CLEAR. WE ARE READY FOR DUMP. [ John ] READY ON THE TUG, DECKERT. [ Will ] OPENING POD DOOR. BRING IT DOWN NICE AND EASY. [ Engine Revving ] [ Deckert ] THERE ONCE WAS A MAN FROM VENUS, WHO HAD SEVEN WARTS ON HIS-- [ Masani ] DECKERT, SHUT UP. THAT'S NOT FUNNY. AND LEAVE MY MOTHER OUT OF YOUR JOKES. YOUR MOM HAS SEVEN WARTS ON HER--SHUT UP ! DON'T JUST SAY, "SHUT UP." I'LL YANK YOUR HOSE OUT.OOH, THAT'S COLD. NO, MAN, 150 DEGREES BELOW IS COLD. THERE ONCE WAS A GIRL FROM URANUS, WHO HAD--SHUT UP. [ Will ] WILL YOU TWO PIPE DOWN OUT THERE, AND LEAVE THE LUNAR CHITCHAT TO AN OLD PRO LIKE ME ? HA ! [ Engine Revving ] [ Will ] HEY, LUCAS, HOW YA DOIN' ? ALL RIGHT, I GUESS. JUST SETTLE DOWN AND RELAX... WHILE I FINISH TELLING YOU THE ARMSTRONG STORY. OKAY.HIS FIRST WORDS WERE, "CONGRATULATIONS, MR. GORSKY." RIGHT.A LOT OF THEORIES POPPED UP ABOUT WHAT ARMSTRONG MEANT, LIKE MAYBE HE SAW SOMETHING UP HERE THAT PROVED THE RUSSIANS MADE IT FIRST, OR THAT HE WAS SOME KIND OF DOUBLE AGENT SIGNALLIN' MOSCOW. FINALLY HE GETS SICK OF HEARIN' ABOUT IT, SO HE DECIDES TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT. IT TURNS OUT WHEN HE WAS A KID, ARMSTRONG LIVED NEXT DOOR TO AN OLDER COUPLE NAMED GORSKY. SO ONE DAY HE WENT OVER THEIR YARD TO GET A STRAY BASEBALL, AND HE HEARD A NOISE, AND THEN HE LOOKED IN THE WINDOW, AND THERE WERE THE GORSKYS GOING AT IT ON THE BED. [ Chuckles ] AND SUDDENLY MR. GORSKY STOPPED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE, AFTER 30 YEARS OF GOOD LOVIN', HE WANTED TO TRY SOMETHIN' DIFFERENT. [ Chuckles ] WELL, MRS. GORSKY WAS SHOCKED. HOW DARE HIM ASK HER TO DO SUCH A THING ? "DREAM ON," SHE SAID TO HIM. "THE DAY I PUT THAT THING IN MY MOUTH IS THE DAY THAT LITTLE ARMSTRONG BOY NEXT DOOR... - [ Masani, Russell Deckert Join In ] - WALKS ON THE MOON." [ Thumping Sound ] - WAIT ! NO ! - WHAT ? - [ Groaning ] - LUCAS ! WHERE IS HE ?B-TRENCH, OUT OF ROVER 2 CAMERA RANGE. LUCAS, RESPOND. ANYONE NEAR B-TRENCH ? [ Masani ] HANG ON. I'M ON MY WAY.

I'M THE WHITE HORSE OF THE APOCALYPSE. AND WHO ARE YOU ? I'M IN CHARGE HERE. NOT ANYMORE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ?WHAT'S TO THINK ? WE'RE SCREWED. TAKE IT EASY. WE'LL JUST GIVE 'EM WHATEVER THEY WANT. FILET MIGNON. WHAT A TREAT. KARL, WE'RE SURROUNDED BY IDIOTS. DID WE HAVE TO BRING THEM ALL ?PATIENCE, MINA. EVERYONE HAS THEIR PURPOSE... AND EVERYONE THEIR TIME. EXCUSE ME, UH, MR. APOCALYPSE ? HI. UH, YOU THINK YOU COULD FILL US IN HERE ? I'M SURE WE COULD WORK SOMETHIN' OUT. [ Clears Throat ] OKAY, MAYBE NOT. CAN'T WE JUST GET ALONG ? ALL I WANT IS TO GET BACK HOME. I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SEEING YOU DIE. - WHAT ABOUT LUCAS ? - WELL, I'M NOT PERFECT, EITHER. SO SIT QUIETLY, AND BY THIS TIME TOMORROW, THIS WILL ALL BE JUST A FOND MEMORY. WHAT'S TOMORROW ?OUR DAY OFF. SHUT UP. COME NOW. YOU DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE COME TO THE MOON... IF I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN I COULD CATCH THE NEXT REFUSE TRANSPORT HOME ? WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM ? ACTUALLY, IT'S YOUR PLAN'S PROBLEM. REALLY ? ALL DROPS WERE AUTOMATED SIX MONTHS AGO. GARBAGE SHUTTLES FROM EARTH DON'T LAND ANYMORE. [ Will ] AND EVEN IF THEY DID, WE GOT OUR EARTH LOAD TWO DAYS AGO. WON'T GET ANOTHER TILL NEXT WEEK. THEY'RE LYIN'. WE KNOW THE SCHEDULE. WELL, THEY CHANGED IT. SURPRISE, SURPRISE. I TOOK YOU ALONG IN RETURN FOR SOME... INFORMATION YOU PROVIDED, CORRECT ? THAT INFORMATION IS OBSOLETE. [ Chuckles ] AND SO ARE YOU. [ Gagging ] [ Grunts ] WE HAVE A PROBLEM. IN APPROXIMATELY 16 HOURS, OUR ABSENCE FROM L4 WILL BE DISCOVERED, AS WILL OUR ESCAPE ROUTE. A GUARD TRANSPORT WILL BE SENT. IF I'M STILL HERE WHEN THAT HAPPENS, I WILL BE VERY UPSET. SO, A COMMON GOAL: GET ME OUT OF THIS. ANY IDEAS ? THERE'S AN INSPECTION SHUTTLE ON ITS WAY. [ Man ] MOONBASE CONTROL, THIS IS THE SHUTTLELIBERTY. WE ARE AT FIVE KILOMETERS AND CLOSING. [ John ] ROGER,LIBERTY. OPENING SHUTTLE BAY DOORS. SEE YOU INSIDE. THEY WALK OUT, YOU WALK IN.I'M A MAN OF MY WORD. [ Computer Voice ] SHUTTLE BAY PRESSURIZATION COMPLETE.

NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO. WELCOME. I'M KARL. GLAD YOU COULD COME. ARE YOU THE PILOT ? THIS ISN'T A SOCIAL CALL, GENTLEMEN. I'D LIKE TO GET TO WORK. I AGREE. LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH. THIS IS MY TEAM. LET'S GET STARTED. HEY, WILL, WHY DON'T YOU TELL HIM ONE OF YOUR STORIES ? MAYBE YOU'LL PUT HIM TO SLEEP. THEY'RE GONNA LEAVE YOU BEHIND, SON. YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU ? WHY, THEY'RE PROBABLY TAKIN' OFF RIGHT NOW. OH, GREAT PLAN, WILL. MAKE THIS PSYCHO KILLER PARANOID. WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT ? YOU COME HERE OFTEN ? PULL UP THE GRID FOR B-TRENCH. B-TRENCH ?

LET 'EM KNOW THEIR FUGITIVES ARE HERE. [ Electronic Static ]I WOULD IF I COULD, BUT THE TRANSMITTER TOOK A HIT. LOOKS LIKE IT OVERLOADED THE RELAY STATION, TOOK IT OFF-LINE. - MEANING ? - WE CAN'T TRANSMIT TO ANYONE. WE DON'T HAVE A DIRECT LINE TO EARTH. L4 IS OUT OF RANGE WITHOUT A STRONGER SIGNAL. HOW LONG BEFORE IT'S BACK ON-LINE ?SEVEN HOURS. I WANT YOU SURFACE-READY IN ONE. UH, WAIT A MINUTE THERE, TANK-BOY. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY INTO THE SHUTTLE BAY. THEY'RE GONNA BE BACK. LOOK HERE. IF THEY COME BACK, AIM FOR THE GUT. WE'RE NOT SOLDIERS.YOU WALK US INTO AN AMBUSH, AND NOW YOU WANT OUR HELP ? I SAVED MY NECK !PUT MINE ON THE BLOCK ! BETTER YOU THAN ME !I'D FORGOTTEN WHAT A CHARMING GUY YOU WERE. STAY OUT OF THIS.BELIEVE ME, I'VE TRIED. MISS MORGAN, YOU'LL DIRECT OUR SURFACE MOVEMENT FROM HERE. WE'LL SUIT UP AND HEAD OUT DOWN AT THE MAIN LOCK. KEEP THE CONTROL ACCESS DOOR AND THE AUXILIARY AIR-LOCK AND THE SHUTTLE BAY SEALED, AND THERE'S NO WAY THEY'LL BE ABLE TO GET TO YOU OR THE SHUTTLE. - OUR MISSION PROCEEDS AS PLANNED. - OH, YOU THINK SO ? - WHAT ? - I HAVE A BRAIN, LIEUTENANT COLONEL. IT'S ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF ABOVE MY BREASTS, IN CASE YOU'RE INTERESTED. B-TRENCH IS FOR NUCLEAR WASTE. THIS ISN'T AN INSPECTION, AND YOU'RE NOT LOOKING FOR DISKS. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS CLASSIFIED. FINE. B-TRENCH COVERS ABOUT 74 SQUARE KILOMETERS. HAPPY HUNTING. CAN EITHER OF YOU TWO WORK THE SYSTEM ? [ Caldecott ] WERTMAN-TOBASHI ASSURED ME YOU'D COOPERATE. IT'S YOUR DUTY. YEAH, RIGHT. NO HABLO INGLES. [ Caldecott ] ALL RIGHT, MISS MORGAN, YOU WIN. POSITRONIC PULSE WARHEADS. - WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ? - [ Will ] SOUNDS NASTY. AS NASTY AS THEY COME. THE PROTOTYPE WE TESTED BEFORE THE GLOBAL SUBATOMIC WEAPONS BAN TOOK EFFECT... WIPED OUT OUR TARGET SITE, AND PART OF CUBA ALONG WITH IT. - WIPED OUT ? - CHECK A MAP. IT'S NOT THERE ANYMORE. SO YOU STOWED 'EM UP HERE FOR A RAINY DAY. THE PENTAGON CONTRACTED WERTMAN-TOBASHI FOR TEMPORARY STORAGE. - ANOTHER SWEETHEART DEAL FOR MARVIN MURDOCH. - ANOTHER ? AND B-TRENCH IS A PERFECT PLACE TO HIDE 'EM. IF ANYONE DOES A SATELLITE SCAN-- THEY'D ASSUME THE READINGS WERE FROM RADIOACTIVE WASTE. BUT THERE'S BEEN A SECURITY LEAK. YOU'RE AFRAID SOMEONE'S GONNA STEAL YOUR TOYS ? THIS HARDWARE'S WORTH A HELL OF A LOT ON THE BLACK MARKET. INSTANT SUPERPOWER STATUS TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER. NOW, MISS MORGAN, I'LL SEND TWO OF MY MEN ON A SWEEP THROUGH THE BASE, SEARCH AND DESTROY. I'M TAKING THE OTHER THREE TO THE SURFACE, AND I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR FULL COOPERATION FROM THIS POINT ON. FAIR ENOUGH ? MOVE 'EM OUT. THIS ROOM IS A SAFEGUARD CHAMBER. LOCK YOURSELVES IN AND SIT TIGHT TILL WE GET BACK. THINK YOU CAN HANDLE THAT ? MAN, THAT GUY'S GOT A SERIOUS ATTITUDE PROBLEM. [ Caldecott ] CONTROL, WE ARE "GO" FOR SURFACE ACCESS. COPY THAT. OPENING THE INNER HATCH. WHAT DO WE DO NOW ?WE WAIT. [ Caldecott ] REPEAT: WE ARE "GO" FOR ACCESS. HOW ABOUT THAT HATCH ? COLONEL, DO YOU MIND GIVIN' THAT DOOR CONTROL PANEL DOWN THERE A LITTLE WHACK ON THE SIDE ? COLONEL ? ROGER THAT, CONTROL. A "WHACK ON THE SIDE." [ Engine Revving ] SO, WHERE EXACTLY IN B-TRENCH ARE THEY HEADING ? THE UNDERGROUND BUNKER SHOULD BE IN SECTOR 56. HMM. FIFTY-SIX. WHAT DID YOU MEAN, "ANOTHER" SWEETHEART DEAL FOR MURDOCH ? NOTHIN'. JOHN, YOU NEVER MEAN NOTHING WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING. YEAH, WELL, PEOPLE CHANGE. WHAT ARE YOU HIDING ? EVIDENTLY, POSITRONIC PULSE WARHEADS. IS HE ALWAYS THIS CHEERY ? ONLY ON HIS GOOD DAYS. [ Engine Revving ] YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A BLUE SECTOR MARKER. THE WARHEAD BUNKER SHOULD BE 20 METERS FROM IT. [ Dana ] COORDINATES 156 AT 34 DEGREES. IT MUST BE COVERED. WHO'S THE GENIUS WHO FILLED THIS PLACE UP ? WELL, COLONEL, IT IS A DUMP, AFTER ALL. [ Caldecott ] THIS IS GONNA TAKE TIME.HOW MUCH TIME ? LONG ENOUGH TO GET SCREWED, LIKE LUCAS AND SOPHIE. THOSE GUYS ARE STILL OUT THERE. LOOK, WE'LL BE FINE IF WE JUST STAY PUT. I'M TOO OLD TO STAY PUT.WILL-- WE GOTTA GET OFF OUR BUTTS. WE GOTTA GET A DISTRESS SIGNAL OUTTA HERE. NOW YOU'RE TALKIN' !THERE'S A PLAN. BUT WE CAN'T. WE'RE ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE MOON. WITH THE RELAY STATION OFF-LINE, THERE'S NO WAY TO BOUNCE AND BOOST A SIGNAL TO EARTH. SO WE CAN'T SEND A SIGNAL AROUND THE MOON, BUT WE CAN TRANSMIT TO THE PRISON. WE HAVE A STRAIGHT LINE TO THEM. THEN ALL WE NEED TO DO IS AMPLIFY OUR SIGNAL FROM IN HERE. AND WHERE ARE WE GONNA FIND AN AMP-- OH, NO, NO, NO. NOT MY STEREO, MAN. I SPENT THREE MONTHS' SALARY ON THAT SYSTEM. WILL, IT'S NOT SAFE OUT THERE. IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK. - THAT TOO. - I'LL GO. SOMETIMES, JOHN, YOU GOTTA LEARN TO TAKE THE RISK. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ? LET'S DO IT. I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU. HEY, HOW COME YOU GET THE GUN ? BECAUSE I'M OLDER AND WISER. YOU COULD GET HURT. HERE. HEY, WAIT UP ! AND GIVE ME THOSE THINGS, MAN. I CAN'T HAVE YOU AMATEURS HACKIN' UP MY SYSTEM. COME ON. [ Unintelligible Dialogue ] THEY GOTTA BE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. BUNKER. CODE ALPHA INPUT. [ Beeping ] THIS IS IT. LET'S PACK 'EM UP. [ Caldecott ] WE'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE AND BE BACK WITHIN THE HOUR. UNDERSTOOD. SO, YOU LOOK GOOD. I WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME ABOUT YOU. WELL, FIVE YEARS ON THE FAR SIDE TAKES ITS TOLL. BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, THE PLACE DOES HAVE ITS CHARM. OH, YEAH. IT'S A REAL VACATION PARADISE. I CAN SEE WHY YOU REQUESTED THE TRANSFER. I WASN'T GIVEN MUCH OF A CHOICE. BUT I GUESS YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING WORKED OUT OKAY, THOUGH. IT'S FOR THE BEST. I MEAN, YOU MOVED UP THE CORPORATE LADDER. IT'S JUST, MY LADDER WENT A LITTLE HIGHER THAN YOURS. YOU LANDED YOURSELF HERE, JOHN. I WORKED HARD TO GET WHERE I'M AT. I KNOW THAT. THAT'S WHY-- WHAT'S THE BIG SECRET, JOHN ? THERE'S NO SECRET. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AND YOU KNOW WHOSE FAULT IT WAS. I MEAN, IT'S ALWAYS EASY TO PICK OUT THE BAD GUY. [ Masani ] WE SHOULD PUT IN FOR HAZARD PAY. A BUNCH OF ARMED PSYCHOS RUNNIN' AROUND A NUCLEAR ARSENAL. YEAH, I'D SAY THAT'S HAZARDOUS. DON'T TOUCH. I'VE GOT THIS BABY CHERRIED JUST SO. I CAN'T HAVE YOU GUYS YANKIN' WIRES OUT. YOU REALLY THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TIME FOR HER ? JUST CAN'T LEAVE HER HERE ALL ALONE. WILL. I'LL STEP OUTSIDE, KEEP AN EYE OUT. GOOD IDEA. KIND OF COLD IN HERE. YOU SHOULD TRY LUNAR NIGHT ON THE SURFACE. YOU SHOULD TRY CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS. ENOUGH TO CHILL YOUR SPINE. HOW LONG ARE YOU PLANNING TO STAY UP HERE ? LONG ENOUGH. IT SUITS ME, DON'T YOU THINK ? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK ANYMORE. I KNOW WHAT I SEE, I KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD, BUT I GET THE SENSE THERE'S MORE TO THE TRUTH. THAT DEPENDS ON WHO TELLS IT. NO. IT DEPENDS ON WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. WELL, YOU SAW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED, DANA. BIOLOGICAL CONTAMINANTS WIPED OUT HALF THE ARCTIC COAST... AFTER I FUDGED THE PLANT SAFETY SPECS. - END OF STORY. - AND THAT'S THE TRUTH ? THE TRUTH IS WHATEVER GETS THE JOB DONE. DANA, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WONDERING. YOU'RE SMART. LOOK OUT FOR YOURSELF DOWN THERE. WATCH YOUR OWN BACK. THAT'S HOW YOU SURVIVE. NO. THAT'S HOW YOU DIE. IF ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS YOURSELF, THAT'S ALL YOU'LL EVER HAVE. HEY, THIS IS MY ROCK IN THE UNIVERSE. I DIDN'T MOVE UP ALL THE WAY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE MOON... HOPING YOU'D STOP BY TO LECTURE ME. OH, I SEE. YOU TRANSFERRED TO THE MOON TO GET AWAY FROM ME. HOW ROMANTIC. [ Caldecott ] BASE TEAM, WRAP UP YOUR SWEEP. ORDNANCE IS SECURE. CONTROL, STAND BY ON THE LOCK HATCH. [ Dana ] WE ARE STANDING BY. [ Unintelligible Dialogue From Headset ] LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE SHEEP HAS STRAYED FROM ITS FOLD. [ Imitates Wolf ] WAIT. DON'T KILL ME.I AM TIRED OF WAITIN'. I'VE BEEN WAITIN' FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS NOW. BUT I CAN GET YOU HOME... AND MAKE YOU RICH. DESPERATE WORDS FROM A DESPERATE MAN. WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE YOU ? HEY, TAKE IT EASY THERE ! GEEZ.

WHAT'S WRONG ? THE HATCH ISN'T WORKING. I'VE GOTTA SEAL IT BY HAND. [ Grunts ] [ Panting ] WHERE'S JOHN ? HE WENT TO SEAL THE LOCK MANUALLY. CALDECOTT'S DEAD. STARK'S ON HIS WAY BACK. [ Alarm Buzzing ] [ Panting ] [ Alarm Stops, Beep ] - [ Grunts ] - [ Man ] HOLD IT. [ Yells ] GET OUT OF HERE, JOHN. NOW ! [ Reloading Noise ] GET DOWN. [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshots Continue ][ Electronic Tone ] THEY'RE INSIDE.[ Masani ] OH, YOU THINK ? WHERE'S JOHN ?HE GOT AWAY DOWN THE AUXILIARY CORRIDOR. JOHN ?HE'S ALL RIGHT. HE KNOWS THIS PLACE INSIDE OUT. IF HE WANTS TO DISAPPEAR, HE WILL. [ Breathing Heavily ] [ Dana On Intercom ] JOHN ? THIS IS NOT GOING AS PLANNED. [ Mina Chuckles ] HUH, YOU HUNGRY ? [ Moaning, Spitting ] DID YOU GET THE WARHEADS ?YES. GREAT. NOW, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GET US INTO THE SHUTTLE, AND WE'RE HOME FREE. WHO'S GOING TO FLY IT ? THIS WAS MY BACKUP PILOT. NO PROBLEM. WOULD YOU TRUST ME ? I WILL GET US OUT OF THIS DUMP. HOW'S IT COMING ? GIVE ME TEN MINUTES.YOU'VE GOT FIVE. I TIED INTO THE SHUTTLE MAIN COMPUTER. WE CAN REROUTE COMMAND FUNCTION THERE. I SAY WE BLAST OFF AND GET OUR BUTTS OUTTA HERE.HOW ? FLICK ON THE AUTO PILOT. YOU CAN DO THAT, CAN'T YOU ? NOT WITHOUT A NAVIGATIONAL SIGNAL LOCK.

DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE IN A CAGE, JOHN ? IT'S INVARIABLE. YOU WAKE UP TO THE SAME BARS, EAT THE SAME FOOD, TAKE THE SAME CRAP AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME, DAY AFTER DAY. EVERY DAY. THE THING IS, IT'S NOT PAINFUL MOMENT TO MOMENT. IT'S ALL THE TOMORROWS THAT WILL KILL YOU. BUT YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU, JOHN ? WE'RE THE SAME, YOU AND I.

LOOK, RUSSELL, WE KNOW YOU GOTTA WAIT ANOTHER 25 MINUTES, SO WHY DON'T WE TRY TO WORK THINGS OUT ? I GET THE SENSE THESE GUYS ARE REALLY MOTIVATED. YOU STILL DON'T GET IT, DO YOU, DECKERT ? THESE GUYS DON'T WANT TO DEAL. AS SOON AS THEY'RE ON THIS SHUTTLE, AND THE AUTOPILOT'S LOCKED ON EARTH, YOU'RE NOTHING BUT SPACE TRASH TO THEM. FULLY AUTOMATED FLIGHT. THE WONDERS NEVER CEASE. WELL, I-IT'S NOT COMPLETELY AUTOMATED. I MEAN, THERE ARE A FEW KINKS IN THE SYSTEM. YOU KNOW, COMPUTATION OF ATMOSPHERIC RE-ENTRY ANGLES, STUFF LIKE THAT. AH, YES. I SEE YOUR POINT.

WE DON'T NEED THE RELAY STATION IF WE CAN PIGGYBACK THE NAVIGATIONAL INFO... ON OUR COM SIGNAL. NOT ENOUGH SIGNAL STRENGTH. WE FORGOT TO REROUTE YOUR AMP POWER. [ John ] STARK, WAIT. DECKERT'S RIGHT. HE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN GET US OFF THE SURFACE. BUT IF YOU KILL HIM, WE'RE ALL DEAD. NOW, IT'S UP TO YOU. IT'S YOUR CHOICE. WE DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. - [ Clicking ] - [ Stark ] A VERY NOBLE ATTEMPT, JOHN. EVEN AFTER EVERYTHING THIS TRAITOR'S DONE, YOU STILL HOPE TO SAVE HIM. BUT HE'S MY PARTNER NOW, NOT YOURS. CONSIDER OUR ARRANGEMENT RENEGOTIATED. [ Gunshot, Signal Buzzing ] [ Beep ]HE DID IT ! DE-PRESSURIZE THE BAY AND OPEN THE SHUTTLE BAY DOORS. [ Masani ] WE ARE OUT OF HERE !WE HAVE SIGNAL LOCK WITH L4. [ Beeping ]PROBLEM. I KNEW IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.THE BAY DOORS WON'T OPEN. DECKERT MUST HAVE SIPHONED POWER FROM THE BASE GENERATOR... WHEN HE CRASHED THE TRANSPORT SHIP.WE'RE SCREWED. NO, NO, NO. WE JUST NEED TO REDIRECT THE TRACTOR BEAM POWER TO THE BAY DOORS. BUT THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE FROM THE CONTROL BOX ON THE SURFACE. HA, NO-NO-NO, MAN. NO WAY I'M GOING OUT THERE. TWENTY MINUTES. I'M GOING.YOU ? YOU CAN'T. YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT THERE AND BACK IN TIME. RIGHT. JOHN ! JOHN !DON'T.
