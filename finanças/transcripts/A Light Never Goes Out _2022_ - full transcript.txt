Bill, these machines are a scam What's going on? I've put in so much money But I'm not getting any back Treat it like you're making a wish What do you mean? They say there's a fountain in Rome If you toss in a coin with your back facing it Your wish will come true Really? Why didn't you say so? How do you toss it? I ran out of money You're so anxious Watch me toss it, just like this Hey... stop fooling around Not like this... how should I toss it? To your right... What was your wish?

I'm my master's apprentice Bill Yeung's apprentice Do you know where he went? He's disappeared for a month now He didn't pay rent, and my salary too What kind of master does that? Can you pay his rent for him? Look... he hasn't paid rent in a long time I've never heard of an apprentice It's been a while since he paid rent The landlord is gonna kick us out Take a look... we still owe... Don't touch his stuff Wait a second, we're really... Get out of here I don't know who you are Stop messing with his stuff I'm calling the police Don't... let me prove it to you... see? This is us... Today is my first day learning to make neon tubes I'm a bit nervous I hope he doesn't hit me on the head with them Steady hands Bend it around like that Woah How did you do that? Red coloured gas inside a green tube That'll make it orange So the colours aren't predetermined? Nothing is predetermined If you want something, you can make it happen I told you so It's finished... What is it? Can I see it again? You can follow my Instagram account Or just get master to show you how it's done Now... He's not coming back He's gone Where did he go? He's dead You should leave My husband left this workshop to me I'll take care of it After tonight You can rest in peace Don't worry, master If you are willing Then I'll take care of the workshop If you have any unfulfilled wishes Tell me before you leave tonight Mrs. Master I remember master once told me He wanted to make a sign What sign? I think he was making this before he passed He was making it without a sketch I asked him what he was making Then he said I hadn't been born yet when they took down the sign Where are you going? Mrs. Master What are you looking at? There was once a beautiful sign right here But it's been torn down What are you looking at? Just looking at what you're looking at It's none of your business (WHITE FLOWER OINTMENT) You keep looking at my sign I'm trying to find the flaws You made this? This is the first sign I made with my own hands I didn't know anything back then So it's a bit rough on the edges I come back occasionally to tweak it You're a sentimental man It's just a sign It's not just a sign It can outlive both of us Even when I'm dead It can illuminate the lives of my grandchildren Thank you Wow, it's beautiful This isn't the most beautiful Come with me You're all dressed up, were you at a party? Don't start It wasn't fun? I've been preparing for this day At my primary school graduation I was supposed to dance on stage But that very morning The principal saw that my dress was torn So he wouldn't let me perform So I told myself then When I've earned my own money I'm getting myself the most beautiful outfit So that everyone can watch me dance Who knew, when I got there The whole place went dark It's fate Nothing is predetermined If you want something, you can make it happen (WHI- FLO- OI-) Your beautiful eyes shine with thousands of lights Reflecting your soul Arousing the memory of our first encounter Leading us afar, following the dance steps They're called neon lights The fluorescent halo Lights up the Pearl of the Orient The home we built Shining in the world The rays of fluorescence Drive away the darkness magically Remind me your spirit - In order to impress you back then - Even being in the darkest - I took down my very own sign - Even being in the darkest - Weren't you gonna rebuild it for me? - Even being in the darkest - Never give up with hope - I wouldn't know how - Never give up with hope You can do it yourself It's not the 'White Flower Ointment' sign Why wouldn't it be? They wanted to switch over to LED Bill had a huge fight with the lady in charge He wouldn't want to re-do this sign You tell me then Which sign does he wanna rebuild? You're his wife, and you're clueless How would I know? I've never heard him talk about Rebuilding an old neon sign Master Wong, you've been friends with my master for years Are you just gonna ignore his dying wish? It was 1973 Guinness world record for the biggest neon sign That was the talk of the town It's just big There isn't much craftsmanship Not much technique involved No technique involved? Kid, you can't even do 1/10 of it - (NATIONAL) - Back then, our whole crew - (NATIONAL) - We'd work for hours on end Took us six months If I was Bill I'd definitely wanna rebuild that That's not it This sign is just red and white Bill loved all sorts of colours No? Maybe this one Super colourful, this must be it - (BROADWAY LOUNGE) - Of course not, naked women as his dying wish? You speak for yourself Kid, - (WILD DEER BAR) - let me see that sign This sign... They wanted to tear it down a few years ago Let me see The Buildings Department were already downstairs - (WILD DEER BAR) - But he went up, climbed on to the sign and yelled, (IF YOU WANNA TEAR THIS DOWN, YOU'RE TAKING ME DOWN WITH IT) At the end, they didn't take it down Damn it, Bill He promised me he wouldn't climb on to those signs He promised Or was he coerced into making that promise? That's between my husband and I According to your request I've mapped out all the signs That were in the stack of drawings Can you read it? You're here right now That's "Mi-do' The radical of that character is flipped It's 'Lee Kung Man', not 'Lee Wong Man' You can't even write, how can you make neon signs? Master said that I was really talented I don't know why your master hired you Let's go You're really gonna go to each location on this map And see which signs are taken down And which signs are still here? The streets were once filled with neon signs You wouldn't be afraid of the dark Now it's all gone There's a new law stating that it's illegal construction They take it down without notice That's decades of history Why are you walking so fast? Bill Yeung, you have some nerve You were late for our dinner reservation I told you we couldn't go in if we're late They'd dare not save me a seat? I'm gonna ruin their sign! How macho of you This was my fault, don't be mad There's a legend in our industry Saying that neon lights have a life of their own When you make a wish And if it blinks Then your wish will come true I don't believe it Give it a try I want a raise Take a look - How could this be? - I said it Try this one I made this one too I hope my mom can live A long and healthy life Try this other one I made that too I want a good husband (MYRIAD LIGHTS JEWELLERY) How did you do that? I know... You knew when they'd be turning on and off Happy birthday I don't have an appetite Can I be your good husband? Bill, talk to me Which sign do you wanna rebuild? I wanted you to tell her on my behalf Happy birthday to you... Turn on the lights I'm opening letters Blow out the candle and make a wish What wish? Then open your present I used dad's life insurance pay-out And invested in an annuity policy It will pay you a fixed amount every month Take a look I don't need it, cash it out Use the money to pay your father's debt Why is he in so much debt? How would I know? Ask your father He didn't pay rent, and he hasn't paid his apprentice He has even told his apprentice that he wanted to rebuild some kind of... sign What apprentice? Just shut down the business if he's in so much debt If the workshop closed down Your father will turn over in his grave How are you going to support yourself? I'm counting on you (NATIONAL NEON SIGN SETS GUINNESS WORLD RECORD) Sorry, I'm late I'll make up for it in overtime I was looking for you last night But you were walking so fast I didn't know where you went Hey What's up? The workshop is in a lot of debt I can't pay your salary Consider that your severance pay Wait a second... You're shutting down the workshop? Master left this for you He left me with nothing good And a huge debt to pay It's still clean Mrs. Master, you have a daughter, right - Your daughter... - You like this one? Take it as a souvenir Put it down... I have an idea... We can crowdfund What do you mean? Basically, it's a bunch of people giving you money Hello everyone My husband is Bill Yeung, people call him Uncle Bill I'm Heung Kong, people call me Auntie Heung We have a daughter named Prism Originally, we had a son But when I was pregnant Bill was working all day on those neon lights And hurt his leg I was pregnant, but working a few jobs I was too exhausted, so we lost the baby But now, our workshop has found a... Cut... That's a very tragic story But it has nothing to do with the workshop So... what do I need to say? If you can't get to the point within the first minute The audience won't know what you're talking about Really? Maybe you should just write it out for me I'll give it a shot I'm Leo I'm an apprentice at this neon light workshop I was never good at anything since I was a kid Everyone said that I was a piece of trash Only my master said I was talented He said that after I've learned the craft He was going to give me a graduation certificate Unfortunately, I don't think I'm ever Going to receive this certificate I hope I can fulfil my master's dying wish As a graduation project So he can see me when he looks down from above Master... I quit The landlord is kicking us out because we haven't paid rent You're not here I've had experience with being kicked out From school, my home, even at the fast food joint I see this place as my home I've been trying really really hard... But this place didn't belong to us in the first place I'm leaving Leo Yes? If crowdfunding can pay off the debt You can own half of the workshop I can't do that, I haven't finished my apprenticeship I'm bad with clients too I'd be driving them away Then you can learn We can look for some old clients Maybe they're willing to help Maybe they know about master's dying wish Alright We need to get master's cell phone back Cover me, I'm gonna open the lock Cover you? (USED CLOTHES RECYCLING) Shit, I dropped it What dropped? The tool dropped Where? This'll do Is this okay? Yeah Were you a thief before? I looked it up online Not this one Is this it? This should be the one Like father, like daughter I remember this bubble wrap They've all been popped What is it? This is a limited edition I've saved up for a long time for this My mom said it got in the way, and threw it out Master said he'd get me another one Found it - I've found it - Right... let's go It's the police Shut the door This way He's on to us Hurry up Wait for me He's not coming after us Take a break, I'm gonna drop dead I can't do this Weren't you seeking death? You just don't wanna die with me I don't know what you're talking about Hey (BILL'S NEON) Master made this sign Give me your portable charger Why the rush? Does it work? Yeah, wait a second Why isn't it responding? Give it to me Is the charger even on? It doesn't work I think it's dead What? That can't be Hey Stop hitting it Sometimes it'll work if you hit it Stop hitting it It won't just start working if you hit it Do things come back from the dead? Your master didn't want me to Rebuild that sign for him Maybe master was afraid that you'd be lonely He just wanted to play a game with you He's messing with me If you win so easily, you'd feel empty afterwards Alright... I'll go back and take a look at it I'll look it up online Maybe it's just the humidity Let's go! Don't worry, I'll fix it for you I solemnly swear in front of these signs That I'm gonna fix master's sign and the phone Wow, there are so many neon signs here Check it out! I made it together with my master (CHEUNG FAT PAWN SHOP) You don't have to wait for a meteor shower anymore This is for you to make wishes! A genie lives inside the jar He'll grant you your wishes You can tell it everything you want When you're studying abroad in the future I won't be beside you This will look after you on my behalf (VICTORIA: I NEED HELP WITH REPAIRING A SIGN!) (WILD DEER BAR) I've been looking all over for you guys Luckily I found 'Bill's Neon' on social media Otherwise, I wouldn't have known that Baby Bill was... Did you hire someone else to fix it? It looks horrible Baby Bill once said that a neon sign must never go out It brings bad luck But the letters 'IL' were broke So he gave me another one as a temporary replacement After that, he never came back And you guys never answered my calls And I couldn't find him Miss Sham We're taking this down, we can't postpone it again It's these assholes again They come here every day to take down my sign Let me get rid of them I'll come with you No worries, leave this to the young people We can watch the show from up here, look at them They're taking down all the signs in Hong Kong - Can you see? - I've warned you many times I'm going up there this time What do you wanna do? Hold this for me - What are you doing? - Take it What are you doing? Are you crazy... Get down from there You're taking it down? Lady, that's very dangerous, get off the ledge Dangerous? It wouldn't be dangerous if you let us repair it Calm down, take it easy It's the law, I can't do anything about it The law, the law The law wasn't there when my husband made this sign And now it's illegal because of a new law? I'm telling you, your new laws are illegal My husband made this sign He's gone now, but the sign still stands If you wanna take it down, you have to take me with it She's gonna faint... Please don't... We'll just take a few pictures and leave They're leaving - They wanna take a few pictures - Get down from there That was awesome, Baby Heung! Alright that's enough, let's get inside Here you go That's too much... We're just repairing it That's too much, way too much Don't you remember? What is it? My dad passed away during SARS I remember that all the signs were broken Baby Bill helped me fix all of them Then business started picking up I remember he told me that His wife wouldn't allow him to charge me any money Otherwise she won't cook his dinner Do you remember, Baby Heung? I seem to recall something like that Thank you (IL) (HELLO? THIS IS BILL'S NEON, WANNA MAKE A WISH?) (LET'S HAVE A CHAT AT MY WORKSHOP!) Bill Yeung Are you still mad at me? You're back early Yeah No payment today? Not yet It's a tough time for everyone They'll pay up later Postponing it again? Can we postpone the food for your family? When SARS is gone Everyone's business will go uphill again But if business is still bad Then they don't ever need to pay? When your stocks lost money Some regulars pre-paid their orders I guess this is me returning the favour If there's a sign, then there'll be business For once, trust me (IL) (B"IL"L'S NEON) (B"IL"L'S NEON) (BILL'S NEON) Our elders once told us Neon lights are essentially writing calligraphy with light My master handed down his workshop to me He didn't hand it down to his son I took over this brand I have the responsibility to pass it on to the next generation Come on That was quick It wasn't, it took him the whole morning Wong said that this was your master's favourite font It's very energetic, just like him Are you sure this is the one? If there's a sign, then there'll be business This is it, let's get to work Master taught me When you're bending the glass tube You need steady hands, a precise eye, and quick reflexes Bring it forward... A little higher... Right, turn it And then... 123 flip it over That's right On to the flame... don't worry 123 flip it over again Don't stay there, that's right Can you manage? Yeah Wait a second Be careful It looks just like it Alright, we're done You're so young How did you end up with those scars? Master once said I can graduate if I get a few more scars You really wanna graduate? Yeah, I never graduated school SARS hit when I was graduating kindergarten Swine Flu hit when I was graduating primary school The high school that I went to wasn't very good So no one attended the graduation Leo When I first met you What were you doing? I... was taking a selfie Selfie? That mask was horrifying It really scared me But the scariest thing was... Are you insane? You can't mess with this stuff It's petroleum gas, we could both die Luckily I came back to pay respects to Bill that day Your master's legacy is up to you Put your heart into it Come on, are you all rested up? It's your turn Alright! Your beautiful eyes shine with thousands of lights Reflecting your soul Arousing the memory of our first encounter Leading us afar, following the dance steps They're called neon lights The fluorescent halo Lights up the Pearl of the Orient The home we built There was one night My dad took us all out to see the meteor shower My exams were coming up, so my mom wouldn't allow it Then my dad made me this jar of stars He said I can make wishes with it I guess these stars are useless Not a single wish came true You remember when we went to Australia together? You were so fixated on the shooting star That you just let the tour bus leave without us Do you remember? I made a wish that day That we could move to Australia There's more creative freedom there But then I realized People said that each shooting star Represents the death of a person When we see the stars in the sky They might already be dead But their light Still shines bright and illuminates our sky Isn't that right? Let's not rush things We can wait until you and your mom are ready I'm ready Up until now I've never seen you shed a tear I'm okay, I don't need to cry Is it required by law to cry when a relative dies? (CHEUNG FAT PAWN SHOP) I needed the lights on in order to fall asleep Back then, your master Turned on the lights every night And turned them off after I fell asleep He was smooth with the ladies... there we go Impressive! You can fix any light Just a little bit We can't finish all that food... Great! - Dinner time! - It's been a while since we had a table of three Hello Prism Who is he? He's your father's apprentice, Leo Auntie This gentleman is... He's Roy Roy... please join us Here, grab a chair Auntie Yes Prism found some pawn shop receipts And you wanted to redeem his items Please accept this as a gift for our first meeting That's very kind of you The pawn shop didn't have a key So we couldn't open it That's easy, leave that to me Who says you can open my dad's stuff? It's okay Dad locked it so that it can't be opened You always open other people's stuff without asking Let me ask your dad for permission tonight then Let's have dinner Auntie Heung Thanks for inviting me to dinner Prism, this one has extra plum sauce Master said you were just like him You liked roasted goose leg with extra sauce Thank you Hey... you... - Be careful... what happened? - I got it I'm okay Bending tubes for 1-2 hours And you're already out of strength? You've been bending tubes? Don't worry, Auntie Heung was amazing! She achieved a 90 degree bend on her first day Take a look Once I uploaded this - (NEON SIGN FINAL WISH PROJECT) - Our crowdfunding went from 0% to 80% That's not bad What? - Delete it - Click this link on Instagram It's deleted If you don't like it, I'll delete it How long is this gonna take? It should be done in a month Thanks Roy... what do you do for a living? We've actually met before At the office When you'd deliver food to Prism I also work on building designs An architect, not bad How long have you two been together? Three years Three years? Why didn't you invite him here sooner? Your dad was worried that you're too busy working That's not true When we were making the sign for the wedding gown shop He told the boss that he'd miss his daughter if she got married His eyes teared up Let's eat Sorry, I should've visited uncle sooner Prism and I are planning... We're gonna get married That's right, auntie Where will you live after you're married? It's so expensive to buy a flat these days Why don't you live here? I can take care of my grandchildren We're going to Australia About a year ago I started applying for a visa for Prism So she can come with me We didn't know when it'd be approved... The application was approved We have to move there within nine months How are you doing? You guys carry on eating, take your time I'll go check on her Do you need to go as well? This is what she always does When I was going on a foreign exchange in college She would feel dizzy I wanted to go on a working holiday after graduation She felt dizzy again She doesn't want me to go anywhere She just wants me to be with her forever She just couldn't bear to see you leave The visa has a deadline If it were my father who felt unwell Would you push me to leave within the deadline? (TO: MISS MILLIE LAU) Grandma, I'm here! My grandma was buried at sea I don't know where she went So I just scatter them everywhere My mom uses this... (REMEMBERING THE DECEASED, OFFERING OUR PRAYERS) ...to send her prayers as well Is it just like your Instagram? Even dead people have Instagram accounts Yeah! But I like coming here to see my grandma Every major festival, her birth date, and her death date I'd come here to see my grandma Your grandma must've loved you dearly Yeah! Grandma, you don't need to worry about me I still haven't graduated But I'm learning a craft, and found a job Grandma, I wish you a happy death anniversary Happy death anniversary Happy death anniversary Happy death anniversary Happy death anniversary Leo, if you're here seeing your grandma in the future Can you also say hello to your master, and myself? The law, the law The law wasn't there when my husband made this sign And now it's illegal because of a new law? Are you looking for Auntie Heung? She's gone home (THE LAW, THE LAW) (THE LAW WASN'T THERE WHEN MY HUSBAND MADE THIS SIGN) (AND NOW IT'S ILLEGAL BECAUSE OF A NEW LAW?) She's really impressive After I uploaded the video Crowdfunding numbers have increased Do you want one? She's out of her mind And you're encouraging her I didn't encourage her You saw in that clip I was scared shitless She went out there herself She was just concerned about master's sign What about the 'Bill's Neon' sign? How's it coming along? We're still on preliminary stages Take a look We might have to do another hundred trials Are you serious? This is it? Just stop making... Wait a second Let me see if I have... I... I was working on some other stuff Let me get you a band-aid Wait a minute I originally thought... If my dad had an apprentice He'd be able to finish rebuilding the sign And fulfil my mom's wishes But you couldn't even handle basic safety How do you expect me to trust you with my mom? I'll make sure to beware of safety issues Don't you ever come back If I don't come back Master's workshop will close down - I have to... - What can you do even if you're here? Do you know how to submit the drawings for wall signage? Where would you install it? Does the landlord agree to it? What about the buildings ordinance? Do you even have a license to conduct minor works? You don't know anything How can you take care of my dad's workshop? Auntie Heung told me that... You think you're helping her? You're an extra burden for her If you want a job, I can help you out It's better than staying here without a future This project is "complated” It's supposed to be "completed" That's the wrong character And there's a typo there It's supposed to be the character for "construction” Auntie Heung, what are you doing here? I'm here to see how you're settling in Stay sharp My daughter is very demanding Auntie Heung, sorry... I... Where are you living now? I'm renting a sub-divided flat I shouldn't be squatting at the workshop What do you mean? Your master let you stay there Rent is expensive out there Even for sub-divided flats You can live at the workshop if you want If you have time... you can bend some tubes Treat it as a freelance job Auntie Heung, you're still bending tubes? Excuse me I made you something to eat I've made you some soup Auntie Heung, let's not talk here Let's talk outside The food in this area is expensive I know... It's not healthy to eat out Let's eat here Auntie Heung, that's not necessary The company is treating the staff to a meal Really? Remember to befriend your colleagues I have something to tell you Master appeared in my dream last night He told us to stop working on the neon sign He just thinks it's tough on me He cared about this sign so much He'd be happy if I finished rebuilding it Face it You're in over your head What about submitting the drawings to the government? What about the license to conduct minor works? Even if you were able to rebuild this sign How long do you think the workshop will last? Master couldn't even keep it afloat He was in massive debt How much longer can you keep it going for? We can crowdfund... We only have a few thousand left after the debt is paid Is that enough to pay the rent, or to buy a new transformer? You never believed that We can keep the workshop running, did you? I... I think you've tried your best I think master would've been satisfied I'm leaving this here, you can either eat it Or you can throw it out No, Auntie Heung... I... Keep working hard I'm leaving It's late, you're heading to the workshop? I'm the only one left If I don't do it, who would? I've talked to the landlord We can't erect a sign on the side of the building That's why dad hadn't made one Then it wouldn't be 'Bill's Neon' I'll work on another one How? Both of you are completely clueless He's an absolute mess It's very dangerous, you know? If he's messy, why did you hire him? Even though he's a mess He has the heart To complete your dad's final wish What about you? Why don't you care at all? You think I don't care? Why did you think the workshop closed down? Are there any subsidies for university tuition? There are grant loans What is it? Are we applying for it? Shall we give it a shot? I've warned you before We have to take out a loan for our daughter's tuition? Are you serious? I'm just saying... we do own property So the application might not go through That's nothing to be proud of We've mortgaged our home It's all because you kept working for free During the period of SARS And you said LED's were painful on the eyes Everyone prefers LED over Neon, except you! Have some vegetables Luckily, I made plans for you I had lunch with Fong today She told me that her husband is now a taxi driver The income is pretty good He can introduce you What? Dad as a taxi driver? What else could he do? Go ahead and ask your dad What else can he do besides bending glass tubes? Hello? (IS THIS MRS. YEUNG?)

My husband has dementia It's been a few years He can't even recognize me anymore How would he remember the sign for Millie's Centre?

There was once a legend Saying that a genie lives inside the neon lights If you make a wish And the neon light blinks Then it means your wish will come true Is that true? When your mom was pregnant with you We went to the hospital because she was in pain The doctor said you had no heartbeat So she had to stay at the hospital I was worried sick So I was wandering around the hospital alone And somehow ended up outside the door I looked up and saw a neon sign on the wall It was a massive neon sign As beautiful as a rainbow (MYRIAD LIGHTS JEWELLERY) I made a wish immediately Wishing for you and your mother to be safe Just like a miracle, you were born the next day So people won't die as long as there are neon lights? It's all up to you now I couldn't keep the neon lights glowing But you must keep the home going (MYRIAD LIGHTS JEWELLERY) Hello everyone, I'm Heung Kong My husband Bill Yeung was a neon sign craftsman He dedicated his life to neon signs He had a final wish To rebuild one of his signs that were taken down Unfortunately, he passed away I hope I can... no, I must fulfil his final wish I hope you will all support me This is one last thing I can do for him Thank you all (BILL'S NEON) All these years, I've used a computer to draw up designs I haven't drawn designs by hand in a long time We didn't have computers back then Enlarged photocopying was expensive So your father and I Would go to the basketball field, rain or shine And slowly sketched it square by square I also helped out Don't you remember? Oh yes According to proper procedures We need to submit these documents I know the procedures But these measurements will not be approved What should we do? Didn't you plan this out?

Mom Why don't you come with us I'm not going I don't speak English I don't wanna be your maid I don't need to cook for you and your father every day I have a lot of free time now Take a seat What are you doing? Sit still What is it? Are you doing my makeup? I'm dyeing your hair Why are you dyeing my hair all of a sudden? I do have a lot of grey hair Do you know what this comb is for? First comb, to the end Second comb, to turn grey together Don't move When we're old And our hair has turned grey I'll help you dye your hair, and you can dye mine I'm not dyeing my hair Why not? There's an engraving Turn gery together, hand in hand forever Remember our glory days When lights dazzled our path My soul, embraved by the sun Indomitable and full of dreams Think back to our joyful times Busy street corners filled with hope Can I still hold your hand And capture the smiles from yesterday? Night goes on, the wind sings An endless story of our lives Love goes on, miss the way you looked In memories that never fade Can't let go of those splendid years Or the moment we said goodbye Still I search for someone from times past Whose shadow stands beneath the waning lights Night goes on, the wind sings An endless story of our lives Love goes on, miss the way you looked In memories that never fade Can't let go of those splendid years Or the moment we said goodbye Still I search for someone from times past Whose shadow lingers beneath the waning lights Whose shadow lingers beneath the waning lights
