( footsteps ) ( lock clicking ) Fall in and catch it. Rise up and let the wind take you there. Put your head down and keep it down, girl. Arms. More arm. See what happens when you listen to me? Reach down and grab the victory. Feel the power, Gail. Inside and out. Drive. Pull. Speed merchant. That's what you are. They can't catch you, Devers. Unless you want to be caught. Get going, girl. ( gunshot, cheering ) Come on. Come on, now. Yes! ( reporters clamoring ) The winner of the women's 100 meter hurdles, Gail Devers, with a time of 12.68 seconds! A new national record! ( cheering ) I won! Did you see me? I saw it. I set a record. Barely. Had a long takeoff, short touchdown, head way up in the clouds somewhere. Bobby, I won today. So did 100 other girls in 100 other places. And if you don't stay on it, the Games, they're gonna slip right through your fingers. Keep trying to tell you, you ain't gonna listen. Okay, I'll practice my takeoffs and work on my touchdowns. Hey, G. Congratulations. You won today. ( bells chime ) Gail. Hey, ma. I can't believe it. This is my day. Come on, your Daddy's waiting for you. You were supposed to be here 30 minutes ago. I know that. How do you do? Where were you? The caterer was late. I got the wrong caterer. I'll never use him again. Hello. How do you do? Thank you for coming. Everything's okay, don't make a fuss. Don't you look nice. Yes, okay. Why do we always get nervous? I don't understand. I don't remember. It's been so long since your uncle and I got married, but-- One more. Wow. Is that the last one? Just ten more. Oh, no, no. We have to get her ready. Who's cousin are you? I'm, um-- This is R.J.'s second cousin. Well, uh, yes. Glad to-- glad to meet you. But let's get her ready. We'll see you outside. Oh, okay. Um, one more. Coach Kersee, so glad to see you. You too, Reverend Devers. Gail will be pretty. Thrilled I'm not gonna make her run today. Thank the Lord I only have to do this once. What do you think? Well, I think they might just make it. I'm getting a front row seat and watch the festivities. Okay. Good luck to you, sir. Okay, see you at the reception. Gail, what is-- Something's wrong. I'm gonna have to take a tuck in this. On, no, Mom, we can't take a tuck in this-- This fit you perfectly a week ago. How could you lose--? My body's always changing. How could you lose so much weight in one week? Come on, Mema, it's okay. Nobody's gonna notice but you. I know. Get your granny's diamond earrings over on the table. Careful. Congressman, how are you? So nice to see you. No. You are not gonna do this again. Not again. Can't help it. I'm so happy today, Mema. Hope it stays that way forever. Kid, you deserve it. ( choir member sings ) We are gathered here today to join this man and this woman in the holy state of matrimony. It is a solemn moment and one not to be entered into lightly. You may now kiss the bride. ( applause ) ( light jazz music ) You stepped on my foot, Robert. Get your foot out the way, Jackie. Sure you know how to do that, don't you? You used to be able to dance. Oh, I'm just waiting for my song. I do. Come on. Let's go visit Jackie and Robert. Hey! Congratulations. Hey, you. Baby girl. Congratulations. Here I go again. Hey, man. I didn't know you owned a pair of hard shoes, Coach. I like to get off the track from time to time. You got a suit too. Yeah. Come together. You all leave my handsome husband alone. You heard that, huh? Shall we dance? Ooh, stop it, Bobby, behave. ( wine glass rings ) First of all, on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Hampton, my wife and myself, I want to thank each and every one of you for coming. I think it's about time that we let these young people go and begin their married life. But before they do, I want to say a few words, because that's what ministers do and I paid for the wedding. ( laughter ) You've got to know that this is one of the happiest moments in my life. We've all seen Gail grow up in this church family. And we've seen her grow into a champion runner blessed with divine power. R.J., her husband, is a fine athlete in his own right. He's not as fast as Gail, but then again he is. ( laughter ) But at least, R.J., you don't have to bring her in by 12:00 anymore. Thank you. But seriously, R.J., I can't think of a better husband for my daughter, or a finer son-in-law. Gail, R.J., to you Gail, and to you, R.J., I'd like to wish you both God's blessing, God's grace, and above all, Godspeed. Godspeed. Godspeed. Godspeed. ( gulls calling ) Come on, Gail! I thought you said this was gonna be the last mile! Catch up, R.J.! All right, now. Don't think I can't catch you. Where are we going? Where you going? Come on, now. Come on! I got you! I got you now! I'm coming! ( roars ) ( both laugh ) Thought you'd get away, huh? ( laughs ) You want some fun, don't you? I'm hungry. Let's get some breakfast. No. I'm not ready to eat yet. 'Cause, uh, there's nobody here but you and me. Come on, R.J. Let's run. Run? I only have two more miles to go. It's my honeymoon. Just two more miles. I promise I'll be back before you get out of the shower. I'm going back, Gail. I'm going back now. I'm going-- Gail? For real. Keep that water running! I'm leaving now, Gail. ( R&B Pop music ) Honey, this is beautiful. Careful, now. I just got you, I don't wanna lose you. You're not gonna lose me. Know what? Let's buy a house. I mean a big house. Yeah, with lots of rooms. And a garden full of flowers. And a fireplace. Yeah, and a dog. Oh, gots to have a dog. Look after you, the kids when I'm not at home. So I don't have to worry about my little family. ( starter gun fires ) I think I made it. I wasn't supposed to win, I was supposed to qualify. Qualifying for the U.S. team, and the Games in Seoul are Kisha McCantz, Shannon Woods and Gail Devers! That's the point. I just had to qualify. ( indistinct dialogue ) ( pants ) ( whistle ) Dammit! Gail, what're you doing? Nothing, I'm fine. Look, this race takes fifty strides, no more, no less. You're four more better than fine. Just a little tired, that's all. Tired? Tired as in, uh, you got too much sleep, or tired as in, you didn't get enough? I got just the right amount. Just got the right amount? Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Hey, what do you see? Where? Down there. Tell me what you see. A lane. Past that. A wall. Past that. I can't see past the wall. Right. Can't see past the wall. You wanna win the gold? Yeah-- Do you want to win the gold? Yeah, I wanna win the gold. See, what you don't know is you already got it. It's out there waiting for you to claim it. You got to use your mind and your heart. Got to imagine yourself already winning that race. Imagine yourself crossing that finish line. First. Huh? Retrace the steps that got you there backwards. So you end up right here, right now. But-- I don't want to hear it. Two 100 meter repeats. Chop chop. Right now. Right now. Gail, shy do you take that shit from him? Same reason everybody else does. He's the best track coach in the world. Says him. Says everybody. I don't wanna talk about Kersey anymore tonight. I just wanna go to sleep. My head is killing me. Mama, what you got on? Mmm. What you doing now? Oh, my eye hurts. Mmm, here. I'm gonna kiss it and make it better. Mmm, you smell good. Oh. R.J. Mmm-hmm. Where you goin'? Huh? R.J. What do you see? What? There. What do you see? R.J. I'm too tired-- Oh, see, you're not looking. But I am. I don't just see a bed with some sheets and pillows. Oh, no. Well, what do you see? What you've got to see. To the other side of that bed. Past those sheets and pillows. See, you gotta see your fulfillment, already there. Sexual ecstasy. Just waiting to be claimed. I'm not sure I wanna claim it. But you got to. It's already there. Gotta see it backwards. See yourself. Gail? I was thinking-- thinking about getting cable hooked up. What do you think? Sure, yeah. Don't forget to call that rep for All Sports Endorsements. He sounded serious. Called me three times. You hear me, baby? Yeah. I heard you. Can you bring me a towel? Yeah. Here you go. We can be out here all night if you wanna-- You wanna start moving these numbers in the right direction? Huh? I don't know. Is it fear, Devers? 'Cause fear is not real, you know, just an excuse to keep you from doing the work that you ought to be doing! I'm not trying to get-- No, you're not! I'm gonna hit the showers. Hey, Devers. Think Europeans are hitting the showers? Huh? ( distant thunder ) ( gasps ) ( groans ) ( crowd cheering ) Go, R.J.! Come on! Qualifying for the U.S. Team in Seoul in the Men's 400 Meter are, George Chapall, Michael Meadows and Steve Heinke. This can't be. What's happening? Oh, hey, girl. Hey, Jackie. You're trying to beat the line too, huh? Yeah, I gotta get out of here. Somebody's been doing too much honeymooning. Yeah, it's R.J.'s cooking. I wouldn't say that to Bobby. You know that's right. What? You're not pregnant, are you? No, I'm not pregnant. I just weighed in with my flats on, that's all. I know what can happen on a honeymoon. Well, it didn't. Of course, when I think about it, when Bobby and I first got married, the next time I looked up, I was carrying five pounds of somebody else's boot in my body. And I know he had something to say about it too. Get up out the chair. You're just in time. Team weigh in. Stand in line there. No, I gotta go. Sorry I can't stay, Dr. Otis. ( door closes ) R.J.? Yeah? Hi, baby. When did you get home? Three hours ago. Practice ran long today. I had to stop at the store. Got home as soon as I could. How was your meeting? My job stinks, Gail. I wanted to come home and tell you about it, I even hoped that maybe you might've even had dinner ready for me. Imagine that. Well, I'm making dinner for you right now. I've already eaten. Towels. Three hours. Three hours, Gail. I told you practice ran long tonight. You don't have to run every second of every day! You're certainly living proof of that. I'm going out. I don't need this shit. I don't need this. I'll be back on the 27th. How am I supposed to reach you in Korea? There's a phone number on the refrigerator. Just in case. They d=said it's gonna be warm over there, so I'm not gonna take a lot of stuff. Oh, do you know where my red sweatshirt is? Uh, clothes hamper last time I saw it. ( phone rings ) Hello? Hi, Mema. It'll take you about an hour to get here. I'll be ready for sure by then. Hold on. Baby, I gotta go. Have a good time. I'll call you, R.J. ( door slams ) ( engines roar ) ( crowd cheering ) ( announcer speaks Korean ) Ladies and gentlemen, this is the first qualifying heat for the women's 100 meter hurdles. ( announcer speaks Korean ) ( starter gunshot, cheering ) ( announcer speaks Korean ) Gail, you okay? Jackie, something's wrong with me. What's wrong? I'm going home, Bobby. Is this the right position? Are all the test results in? Well, what could it be? We want an answer. It's nothing. We can't find a thing. Look, the x-rays are clear. And that's all you can tell us? Here, see for yourself. ( machine clicks ) It's probably just stress. Doctor, my daughter is an athlete. She's a fine tuned machine. She knows when there's something wrong, and so do I. Please, you're always free to seek a second opinion. Mrs. Devers, I believe that this is an emotional response. Is there something bothering you? There's nothing bothering her at all, thank you, Doctor. I can't believe this. Hey. Hey. Nothin', huh? That's what they say. Unless they say I have everything, which is the same as nothing. I'm the sickest healthy person around. Then they don't know what it is. They mostly say it's stress. They're doctors, they ought to know what they're talking about, that's what it is then. They don't know. Only I know what's wrong with me. You do, huh? What is it? When I started running, it was almost by accident. My mother said I had stolen a star from the sky. I would look up into the night and I'd wonder which star I'd stolen. Then I got scared, 'cause I realized if I had stolen a star, it wouldn't be up there, it would be with me. Wouldn't God want it back? I'm saying God came and took his star and stuck it back up in the sky. Maybe he doesn't want me running anymore. What do you think? What do I think? I think it's the most words you said at one time since I've known you. ( thunder ) Hey, it's getting a little late. Let's go. No, I'm gonna sit here for a while. Practice tomorrow, Devers. Be ready. ( thunder ) Dammit. You sure running is your gift, Devers? You added three tenths to your time. You must be marked or something. The great Gail Devers. It's Mrs. Hampton. Excuse me. Mrs. Hampton. Haven't seen your husband around here in so many months, thought you might've been a widow. By the way-- hey! We don't believe in godspeed here on my track. We rely on our own. Got it? Now do it again and faster this time. Come on! Show you're right! How come you didn't do that in the first place? Much faster when she's mad, huh? Atta girl! Check it out. Hey, Gail! Where's she going? I'm glad you left. R.J.-- No, no, who the hell is he? Maybe I should go back. Are you crazy? For what? I'm trying to get you to see him for who he really is all along, Gail. I knew you'd get it one day. R.J., please. Wouldn't talk to a man like that. You're not going back to him, Gail, I'm serious. I'm putting my foot down. No sneaking behind my back. And where am I going to find myself a coach? I'm not gonna give up running. Where? I'll tell you where. Me. You? Yeah, Gail. I know everything he knows, even more. It'd be great, we can work together every day. Hey, who knows more about the length of these legs and where they lead than I do? Huh? You'd really coach me? You promise, R.J.? I'm a man of my word. And you know that. Come on. Let's go. One more set. Come on, hands up. R.J., please. Get the knees up. Knees up. Come on, let's go. Get them up! Slow down, slow down. All right, let's walk it out. Good. Yeah. We can do this. Hey, Gail. How you feeling? Okay. Good. Go in the house, baby. She doesn't want to see you. Ever. Why don't you let Gail tell me that. She doesn't even want to see you to tell you she doesn't want to see you. That's how much she doesn't want to see you. All right. Hey. Hey. So what happened? R.J. is training her now. What? R.J. is training her now. Did you talk to Gail? No. You know you didn't help the situation any, Bobby? What're you talking about? I got her to the games. And the fact that she lost, that's not my fault. You got her to the Games? Yes, I got her to the Games. No, she got herself there with your help. Maybe there's some other runners who do want my help. Yeah? None as fast as Gail. You know this makes no sense. How is R.J. gonna help Gail win anything, let alone some gold? ( alarm buzzes ) R.J. Come on, sweetheart. Time to hit the track. Come on, R.J., you'd promised you'd come with me. You said this morning you'd come. Not now. No. Ugh. Are you gonna train me or what? We'll do it this weekend. I promise. This is the third time, R.J. I need you to come with me. I gotta be at work at 9:00. Come on, now. I'm tired. ( panting ) Gail? I wouldn't have phoned, Dr. Otis, but you're my last hope. It's fine. Sit down. I-- I haven't been feeling well. Uh-huh. Right. I see. How long ago did this start? I don't know, a year? No, longer, while I was still on the team. I see your skin. Something's wrong with me, isn't it? Gail, I believe something is wrong. I have a friend of mine, Dr. Ginsburg. He's a wonderful doctor. And I want you to see him. You tell him everything you told me. "It's nothing." "Is there something bothering you?" "It's probably just stress." Dr. Otis, I need you to come with me. Oh, Gail. You just tell him-- No, no, I need you to come with me. I need you to tell him. You tell everybody. Nobody believes me. Okay. I bet you just came from the track. I bet you're thirsty. Yes. Come on, let's get something to drink, all right? He was easy to talk to. That's for sure. We can get some answers. Robin. Dr. Otis. Gail. Well, Gail, your thyroid's out of whack. ( chuckles ) What does that mean? Well, the thyroid's a gland. Located right about here. And it secretes hormones that control your metabolism, your nervous system, and the action of your muscles. At least that's what it's supposed to do. Yours is not working very well. It's also why your weight goes up and down. I knew I wasn't crazy. I knew there was something wrong all the time. You're definitely not imagining things, Gail. That's good to hear. Grave's disease is very real. How serious is it? You see your thyroid is twice the size that it should be. So? We need to get it back down to normal size. Well, how are you going to do that? Well, to be honest, I'm going to need some time before I can advise you on the best treatment. Treatment. So, there's a cure? Doctor, there is a cure, isn't there? What are you telling me? No cure. Gail, where have you been? I was just getting ready to start calling around for you. There's no cure, R.J. Nothing. For the rest of my life I'll just have it. Maybe they're wrong again. No. No, not this time. Come on, babe. Come on. Everything's gonna be just fine. He just comes in. Read it and weep. ( overlapping dialogue ) Don't look at them till you have to. That was a 24 shot clock. At the time, maybe. Does not run long. Hold on. Time out! ( phone rings ) Yeah, he is. Hold on. Bobby. Bobby? It's Dr. Otis. Hey, Doc. What? Ugh. All right. Thank you. What'd she want? Gail's not doing too well. You already knew that. Gotta get back to the game. Y'all? Gail's not doing too well. She's worse than we thought. Poor R.J. You guys go ahead. She gonna be all right? Excuse me. Leave a message, and we'll call you back. ( beeps ) Hey, Gail? This is Bobby. Pick up. Gail? It's Bobby. Call me when you get this message, all right? We got each other, baby. No more heartbreak about running after the gold. We'll settle down and be normal. Have a family. Just be together. When will I be able to run again? Well, you may be able to run again someday. When? I'm recommending radiation therapy to shrink your thyroid, Gail, and I expect very good results from that. But the side effects can be very uncomfortable. Now, the beta blockers will help your body through all of that and help protect you. Gail, you've gotta understand one thing. What? This whole treatment is gonna slow you down. It'll be a very long time before-- before you have the energy to run again. Hey, hey, Gail. Hold up. What's the word about you? Dr. Otis called me and she-- she told me about your illness. So it took Otis to convince you. Come on, I knew there was something wrong, I just couldn't put my finger on it. I did try to call you. Hey, hey, you're gonna beat this. You might even run again. You don't know anything about my business, Bobby. Hey, Gail. You hang tough. Gail, let's go. I'm parked in the red. There's my ride. You all right? It's cool. Come on, let's go. You have reached the International Athletic Medical Hotline. The following are a list of drugs banned by current guidelines. All steroids, Corticotrophin, Erythropoietin, and Somatototrophin are also included in this group. All beta blockers are also banned. If the use of any banned drugs are detected, the offender is subject to due process and possible expulsion from the Games for two years to life. ( coughing ) Gail? R.J. What're you doing? You sick? Give me some privacy, please. Are you sick? Gail, not one. You haven't taken one pill. I'm not gonna sit here-- No! You're killing yourself! And you're fucking killing me! I'm not taking it anymore! You better take these pills. You don't understand! I do understand! I know right now! You gotta stop, girl. You gotta stop! I'm not taking this shit no more! I'm not taking it, Gail! ( door opens, slams ) ( thunder ) Not taking this shit. Tell her to take this medication, please. She's hurting. She's not taking this medication because she believes you want her to go back to the Games. I didn't tell her that. Doesn't matter. You and I both know Gail is never gonna run again. So even if the beta blockers are banned by the committee, she'll never be tested because her running career is over. Look, you are her husband. You tell her to take them. You're the great Bob Kersee. The guru. That's right. She'll listen to you before she listens to me. She always has! She hasn't done that in a long time, and you know when that stopped. She can't sleep. Her hair is falling out. Her legs bleed, her face peels. So would you please tell her to take the beta blockers? I don't know. I'll think about it, okay? I'll think about it. Dr. Bates, please report to radiation therapy. Dr. Bates to radiation therapy. Hey, hey. Hey. How's it going? All right. Pain's not as bad as they said. Good. The radiation will be over soon. How soon? Soon enough. Oh. Soon enough for Barcelona. I don't think we should be worrying about Barcelona right now. This grass needs to be watered. You're thinking I should take that medicine. Maybe. You can't even say it. Bob Kersee never just thinks maybe about anything. You really don't want me to take that medicine. I can't tell you-- You can't do it. You can't tell me to give up any hope I have of ever going to the Games. Gail, listen, please. Tell me to take them and I will. I can't tell you-- I lied about the pain. It's bad. It's real bad. Tell me to take them. Gail-- I get night sweats. My head aches so bad, I'm afraid I'm gonna die, and then I'm afraid of-- I'm afraid I'm not gonna die. Tell me to take them, Bobby. Please, Gail. Should I take them? What're you doing? Say yes, and I will. Come on. Gail-- hey! Just pick one up and hand it to me. What're you doing? Tell Jackie I said hi. Gail! Damn! Mommy! Here I come! ( kid's laughter echoes ) I may pass you! ( birds chirping ) It's a beautiful day in Los Angeles. Rise and shine and I want Jesus to walk with me. ( gospel music plays ) ( laughter, doorbell ) Here's my baby. Hi. I'm so glad you're here. Look, who's here, everybody! ( all saying hello ) How you all doing? Um, Papa's in the den, right? Yes, I think so. Hey, Papa. Hi, sweetie. Happy Birthday. This is for you. Whoa. Look at this. What is it? Open it and see. Okay, gimmie that. I'm thirsty, I'm gonna get something to drink. All right. Excuse me. When's R.J. coming? I don't know. You don't know when he's coming? I don't even know where he's at. I haven't for over a week or so. I don't understand. Where would R.J. be? I don't know, Papa. He stopped leaving me notes a long time ago. Wait, I don't understand. What did you do, have a fight or something? What is all this about, huh? Look at me. What do you mean? Look at me. Well, honey-- Sweetheart, this-- Would you all just look at me! That's going to go away. Yes. Somebody help me please! We're here to help you. Be patient. I've always told you, god will find a way-- Oh, please, Papa! I don't know anymore prayers! Don't you talk that way now. Why does god hate me? God does not hate you. Why doesn't he help me? Oh, baby. Come stay with us. Come home with us. Stay here. Did he leave you? ( overlapping dialogue ) I can't stay here. You shouldn't be alone Gail. You can't-- I'm going after her. No, no, no, let her go. Let her go. She wants to be alone. ( guests murmuring ) That's our baby. She need us. I know that. There's nothing we can do about it now. In God's hands. God's hands. God's will. God, God, God. When are you going to see that it was Gail's will to run all those hurdles? Gail's will to break through all those finishing tapes? Wasn't Gail's will there somewhere? When are you going to give Gail credit for what she's done? When are you going to stop putting God in your place? ( phone rings ) Maybe she just wants to be by herself, Bobby. ( doorbell chimes ) She's not home. Her car is still here. She might not want to see us. Bobby, what-- I'm going in. Come on. Come on. Hey, Gail! Hey, girl! Gail? It's Jackie and Bobby! Gail? Why are all these mirrors covered? I don't know. This is strange. I told you. Told you she wasn't here. Want me to leave a note? We'll call her next time. And next time she better answer. ( door closes ) ( sobs softly ) Let's take a look at highlights in today's championship. ( garbled sportscast ) ( jazz music plays ) And they're off! ( jazz music plays ) Lawrence by a body length! Gail? Gail. Gail? Gail. Gail? Oh, Gail. Baby, wake up. What have you done? Oh, God. Oh, no. Gail, wake up. Just wake-- No. Come on, baby. ( panting ) ( no audible dialogue ) Nurse, have you heard anything from the doctor yet? Nothing, huh? There's R.J. R.J., where is she? I found her at the house. I didn't-- You didn't find her, you left her! No, no, no. I tried-- R.J., don't you stand there and tell me you tried to do anything! You abandoned my daughter. That's what you did. I did not! I tried to-- She cut me out! You did? She didn't want me! That's not true. I told her to take that medication and-- Where is she? Where is she? What room is she in? I can't do this. I'm outta here. You won't listen to me, you handle it. Where's Dr. Ginburg? Larry, here he is. How is Gail? Where is she? Mrs. Devers, Reverend. Gail's been hemorrhaging a lot. I'm going to see her. Wait. Hemorrhaging from what? It's a side effect die to the high radiation toxicity level. Gail's going to recover from this. And they're will be no more radiation treatments. Oh, thank God. But the damage to her feet, is critical. How critical? Not taking the beta blockers. Wait a minute. What are you talking about, beta blockers? I'm sorry, I gave her some medicine that she was supposed to take that would help her through this period. And for some reason, she didn't. It's compromised her immune system, it's left her vulnerable to infection. Doctor, please. Worst case? Yes. She might have to have her feet amputated. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. Oh, no. Can we go see her? Why don't you look after each other right now. I'll come and get you when there's time. All right, sweetheart. I need you to be strong, okay? How is she? Bobby, we don't know. Still waiting to hear. What happened? Bobby, she is so sick, she may never walk again. Never walk? Dr. Ginsburg said that he-- I mean she hadn't been taking some medication she was prescribed. Oh. Yeah, R.J. mentioned that a few weeks ago. So you knew? Huh? I visited her and we talked about it. Bobby, are you telling me that you never told her to take that medication? No. She said, she knew what she wanted. I'm just a little confused. For six years now, she's done everything you've said. Reverend Devers, on the track and in the gym, I'm God. She does what I tell her to. But this came from inside Gail. Said she knew what she wanted. Nothing I could say. If something happens to Gail, it'll kill her mother. We just have to have faith and everything will be all right. You believe in God, Bobby? I believe in Gail. I believe you do. I believe you do. Can I go see her? Please. Bobby. Hey. Bobby, they wanna take my feet. Don't talk, just stay relaxed and take it easy. You go out there and you tell them, they can't have my feet. I should've taken that medicine. What's that? What's what? What do you see? You mean the wall? That what you see? A wall? Uh-huh. That's not what I see. 'Cause I'm looking through it. Past that. Like I'm on a road and houses to the track. And I'm not just walking... I'm running. Look at me. Bobby, you said-- You said the race I'm gonna run is out there waiting for me to claim it. Well, I'm claiming it. Right here, right now. I'm already running that race. Can you see me? Can you see me, Bobby? Yes. Know something? First time I've been able to see through one of those damn things. I'll see you on the other side. Yeah.

( overlapping dialogue ) Which key? I can't see without my glasses, baby. She's not wearing them. She doesn't want to wear those glasses. Just-- Here we go. It's time we made that peach pie for you. Oh, I wonder what peaches. And a clean kitchen to eat it in. Okay. Hey, hey. Hey, Bobby. I'm in here. Oh, those are beautiful. Who are they for? You. Ha ha. Thank you. Where is everybody? Called them all up, told them not to come. What? I don't want a party. Being alive's enough. You got that right. ( both laugh ) Listen, Gail, I'm real sorry about R.J. R.J. had a right to run. I've been running from him for long enough. Would you like some iced tea? Yeah. I made some for you special. Bobby, I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna live with this for the rest of my life. But the medicine's gonna keep it under control. Keep me from having a relapse. Bobby, I want to go to Barcelona. No problem, I'll get you box seats. Back side. Where's the sugar? Bobby, I want to run in Barcelona. I'm going to the Games. You sure? I'm sure. You know, Barcelona is only 18 months away. The trials are no more than a year away. I know. Are you sure you know? Remember when I told you about my star? I said God took it away. Yeah. Well, I'm taking it back. It's mine and I want it. What about your feet? Like you say, Bobby, what do my feet have to do with running? No more than flesh on bone. Just flesh on bone. ( grunts ) ( panting ) Bobby, I-- I can't. Sure you can. Come on, try. No, Bobby, I thought I could. Okay. But I can't. Know what I'm thinking about? I remember the first time I ever saw you race. It was high school. 1984. Mmm-hmm. Boy, you were something. You ran just like a gazelle. You were fast furious. You won that first race by, I think, about three inches. You must've run 600 miles in preparation for that race. For three inches. Hmmm. Think you got three inches now? Let's see those three inches. Three inches. Hmm? You can do that. ( gasps ) Hot dog! Whoo! ( laughs ) You remember the first time you ran for me at S.C., right? I must've run you 800 miles in preparation. You won that race by, I think, by about four inches, right? Yeah, four inches. There. Four inches. You just keep remembering Barcelona! ( inaudible dialogue ) ( motivational music ) Hold it. Barcelona. ( no audible dialogue ) Barcelona. Do it again. Do it again. ( motivational music ) ( no audible dialogue ) All right. All right. Let's go! It's Barcelona! ( engines roar ) ( crowd cheers ) Next up is the first of the preliminary heats of the Women's 100 Meters. Now, Gwen Torrance is due to race the last heat. But this first heat has the surprising presence of one young lady, I'm talking about Gail Devers! Absolutely right. Ladies and gentlemen at home, it's not a ghost you see on the screen, but it's Gail Devers in the flesh. She's back, she's ready to run. But the question is, can she run against this world class field in the presence of Gwen Torrance. Gail Devers is in lane 5. The main competition this heat will come from Cuthbert of Jamaica in lane 4. And from Privalova from the Unified Team in lane 6. They're both excellent runners, and right on either side of her. Well, there's Gwen Torrance sizing up her competition. I'd say. Not a good start for Devers, but it is a strong start out of the blocks for Cuthbert. Devers and Privalova running second and third. And the top three, Cuthbert, Devers and Privalova moving on to the finals. ( cheers and applause ) Bobby. There's something I wanna say before the race, you know. I wanted to-- damn! I'm not good at this. ( cheering ) I just wanna tell you, Gail-- Bobby. I'll see you on the other side. Gail Devers. I see your life in my mind. It's on tape in my head. I play it every day. I rewind it, and I play it again. And when I put it on pause, I stand back in awe. Gail, you're a champion. Get going, Gail. Come on. Ladies and gentlemen, the next event is the finals of the Women's 100 Meters. ( announcer speaks Spanish ) The lane assignments are lane 1, Dahl, Cuba. Lane 2, Devers, USA. Lane 3, Cuthbert, Jamaica. Lane 4, Ottey, Jamaica. Lane 5, Torrance, USA. Lane 6, Numema, Nigeria. Lane 7, Privalova, the Unified team. And lane 8, Punali, Nigeria. ( cheering ) ( announcer speaks Spanish ) Ladies and gentlemen, we have a photographic finish. ( announcer speaks Spanish ) The result of the Women's 100 meter are 5th place, Ottey, Jamaica. 4th place, Torrance, USA. 3rd place, Pivalova, Unified Team. 2nd place, Cuthbert of Jamaica. And 1st place, Devers, USA! With the time of 10.82 seconds! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! ( all cheering ) ( reporters clamoring ) Do you want to win the gold? Do you want to win the gold? See, what you don't know is, that you've already got it. It's out there waiting for you to claim it. You gotta imagine yourself already winning that race. Imagine yourself crossing that finish line first. Baby girl! ( laughs ) You got it! You wanted it. And you got it! ( cheers and applause ) Closed Captions provided by Digital Post Services
