Andhra-Karnataka border area Fire... My hut is burning down! We came here with whatever things we could save. Our lives have been reduced to ashes. Forest got totally burnt. lt was done by miscreants. Reddappa! Forest was an hurdle for him to dig. We were an hurdle for him to clear the forest. That's why he got his men to burn it down. Along with forest, our lives too! Man...man walks... - Why are you digging a ditch? Hiding...I'm hiding the soil. When we needed food, soil gave us food. What if soil vanishes? Those bastards are stealing it. Man....man walks on soil... when dead soil covers man... Reddappa burnt down the entire reserve forest. Everybody knows it. Since it is burnt, he'll get it from govt. for mining with a plan. Let any useless man say anything... l believe only in Mother! Every year I'm celebrating the Nine day festival in Mother's honour. Why are you after me? Why don't you cover the celebrations? We were the lords of this place. We owned all the mining operations here. Since we didn't have heirs, Reddappa took it from me by force. He's giving my monthly dole. Waterbody is polluted here. Land is polluted here. People's health is gone. They are only breathing iron dust. What happens to them? lnquiry? Let them do it. I am honest person. I do my business legally. He has mixed politics, business and crime. He was running a small business with a man known as Chakravarthi. He made 1 lakh crores in 15 years! 1 lakh? 1 lakh crores? 12 zeroes? injustice is bigger word than justice, right? So that's why it wins! Corruption! - They burnt it down! Soil! Hey you Duryodhana, Dussasana, Karna and Shakuni! Mother Earth who protects every life and imbibes them into her, and you're trying to rule over her, leave your ego or else, I'll consecrate her with the blood of you villains! Abhimanya! You're an innocent kid who doesn't know anything. This is not a game, kid! Even if the armies of all the 14 worlds join together, they can't stand before the army of Drona! Drona's army! ls it your battle plan to surround a lonely young man by capsizing his chariot? ls that your teacher's instinct? To the loser this is treachery, for the winner this is battle plan! l swear on my mother! l swear on Pardha, a friend of God! l swear on this land, my weapon! l swear on my victory dot on my forehead. Till my last drop blood and till l die and unite with soil, l will fight! Silly boy, curtain wasn't fully down! He'll die, right? lt'll be completely down. My fault to talk to him. Please don't raise the curtain. Lord! What happened to my husband? Where's my husband? l can't manage with this moustache and beard. Next time I'll do another role. Do it, the few people who come to watch now will also stop coming. l too have fans, you know that? What happened to you today? ls it the way to deliver those dialogues? This is enough for those people. - I'll beat you. Grandpa! - What else then? Was there any life in the role he was playing now? Repeat that Mother Earth dialogue. Support and protect millions of lives.... l said how did you deliver it there! You need be furious there not just angry! Your voice must shiver! For delivery of dialogues, there are ups and downs! l can see only down in my life, l haven't seen any up! There's nothing short in this foolish argument. Why do you consider theatre as so cheap? Who wants this theatre, grandpa? Just go out and see, there are more artistes than audience. Rail will play even if there's just one passenger. Theatre too like that only. lt should go on...must go on! Who benefits from it? Documents and rubber stamps you want are ready. What about bank passbooks and documents? Everything is ready, come with your people. l need their signatures. Two of my people would be there in an hour. Bank passbooks and land documents? Grandpa, l got admission from an American University. They're paying 50% as scholarship. l'll manage myself after reaching there. No, how could you decide without even informing me? l thought of telling you after everything is done. l can't do this theatre anymore. Move! - Take it. Go! What's he doing? Lift it! Fire! Who are you? Good job, Karna! Are you Karna? Stop your magic, boy! l'm not a boy but king! Son of mighty warrior Bheema! A terror to everyone on this earth! l'm Ghatotgacha Karna, no to need wait anymore. Use the powerful missile. Friend! l acquired it for Arjuna. This is my order. Thank you, Karna! Boy! - l'm king not boy. l'm a Pandava prince who rule this earth! l'm a heir to the valour of demons! l'm an expert in warfare, witchcraft, black magic and weaponry. l'm a warrior who can rule over this earth! Though l'm a warrior, my exceptional talent got wasted, though l had father, my mother lived a lonely life, l've made the world know who my mother is and earned myself eternal fame. O Mother Earth! O Mother of mothers! lt's time for me to reach the abode of your holy womb! Take me into you, mother! lt's over! Get up! Get me the phone! How well you acted, son! May God bless you years also to you. - l'll be there in 30 minutes. And live as an artiste! Artiste? To live this wretched life? No... - Artiste? Tell me. Why are you talking about America? l wanted to take you to this year's Bellary theatre festival. l wished to see God's incarnation in you and show it to people also. Why do we need this theatre and incarnations, grandpa? Our lives are stinking with make-up! l can't bear it. Grandpa, now its the time of necessity of living! lt means make your own life! What? Make their own life? Had brother thought like that, you'd have remained an orphan in Bellary. Keep quiet, brother. What's wrong in it, brother? You were on streets, he raised you. He sent you to school and college. l know, l didn't do Engineering to live behind that curtain. l'm not going to America for myself, l'm going for everyone's sake. Grandpa, we too much change with time. Art is one that can change time also. l'm done, do as you wish. He's teaching me lessons. Why do you force your dreams on others? We too have dreams of our own, right? That's a dream! You see it in your sleep. This is art! lt's to wake up! Don't consider art as food provider. lt teaches you how to live! Move aside! lt seems your American secret is out! Uncle, claps are good to hear but can't provide us with food. That old man can't understand this. Whatever it is, you've hurt him. He'll feel like that now, by morning he'll understand. Okay, l've some work, will you come out with me? Where? You take out the vehicle. - Where? Did he tell me? - l thought he'll tell me. Come...visa? You'll get Visa even if you don't have passport, come l say! What's this office? No chairs to sit also. Please sit down. Who is this chimpanzee in pant and shirt? Manipulation Murthy! Great man! Without a penny, he'll get you Chicago. l can see that. Check, it has bank passbooks and documents. What's this? You need to show you've property here to go to America. Why would a rich man go to America? That's fate! One who needs won't get the opportunity, one who has opportunity doesn't need it. Uncle, if fate is not favourable to us, we must make it favourable ourselves. What should we do? Please sign this paper. - Sign? Are you planning to take away my property? Do you've property? Why not? We've make-up material, props, beards, moustaches. Fire spitting arrows, flying... - Few moustaches and beards too, shut up. What's this cheaply, uncle? - Cheap? We have only that, right? Take their signatures here and l need their photos too. Photos? - Do you've photo? lt's in Lord Hanuman's get up, is it okay? lt's in Duryodhana's get up, is it okay? Do you've camera phone? - l do. Take it. Uncle, smile! Smile please! Take print outs in computer, sir. Can computer do all that? That's what you call manipulation. - l can see it. There are land documents in it, it's hand written with joint letters. Get it done by that elderly man. Elderly man, write the document for him. l'll write if you pay Rs.100. Give me Rs.50, l'll do the rest also. lt's joint writing, let him do it, don't be so stingy. Give me the pen, l can do better than Kamalahassan in the film 'Bharatheeyudu'. A cheat who changes colours like chameleon! ls there any drama he can't play? lt's a shining life of makeup and glittering life of tin box... But not a penny in the purse... We're kings once the curtain goes up... Should we all our lives sharing few pegs and wigs? O Lord, please change this routine.. Make us reach the pinnacle of glory... World is the magical Mayasabha, don't slip on it... l'm a king to myself, there's no Draupadhi to laugh at me... Life is a drama, listen to me... lf light goes or you change lines, the scene goes haywire... There's no loss in taking risks, you may get the world... Find the address of luck and life is yours, live it on your terms.... lf luck favours, spread your magic... Bribe your life with wish and get the best... That's the matter! O Lord, please change this routine.. Last night you didn't come home, l thought you'd gone to America. l came back to take you also with me. Pack your bags then. - Why are you pouring water? You can't do it if like me. l mean like you. The place under fan is mine. Where were you last night? - l went to America. You carry on, girls. Grandpa, move! Move, grandpa! Grandpa!

Don't you want Surabhi? Surabhi has been giving us life for 7 generations now. Yes, it had seen golden years long back. Now it has grown too old like you. lt's very difficult to stand again. Old...old? All of you are nasty sons who sell their mothers for a living! Will you use mother and society for your personal gains? Beat him! He'll go away to America, should we beg on streets with Surabhi theatre? Beat him! He's responsible for Guru's death, beat him. Why don't you beat him? Please don't fight among yourselves. Elderly man's soul will not rest in peace. Sorry, buddy! l blabbered in anger. He died naturally, what can we do? ls it wrong to live for ourselves? Uncle! Grandpa...grandpa... Everyone is sharing everything. But who will share this? He wished to get his mortal remains immersed in his home town. That too with your hands. Son, he gave you life. You gave him death! Account is settled. Please play this one last drama, l beg you, son!- Grandpa! What's going on is God's play... Olden times old description... What you see is story... Ploys of Bhagawatha is true reflection of real life... What's going on is God's play... Elderly man wished to see you donning the role of Lord Krishna. He loved and respected Bellary Theatre festival. lt was his hometown and he was invited to the place every year. But he never visited the place, l don't know why. But he wanted this drama to be played there only. And you must do that role. Please play there for once. This will not happen, l'll go to Rajahmundry. At least immerse his ashes and go away. No way!

Sir, that is... - Shut up! Don't talk! Theatre is getting ruined because of people like you. Recently in Pitapuram, while enacting the stripping scene of Draupadhi, Pandavas too joined Kauravas to strip her. Who is he, uncle? He's Rampam... - l'm not Rampam. Rangasthala Pandit.

Where's the hero who was born to do good? Babu is there! Excuse me. l asked you to play the role of the princess and you misunderstood me. What did l think? Do you want me to tell truth or lie, princess? You like me, that's true. You think you don't like me, that's a lie. My name is Babu, what's your name? Papa! Hey Babu! Next is your scene, come quickly. Watch it till end, climax will be sensational! Come quickly. Hail Goddess Patala Bhairavi! Kali...Goddess Mahakali!

What l'm doing isn't prostrate, Guru? - No! l don't know how to do it, please do it for me, Guru. You're so troublesome boy! Prostrating means, lie flat on ground and pray to holy Mother. Hail Goddess Patala Bhairavi! Babu! Reddappa is here, please start the drama from the beginning. Reddappa is here, please play the drama from the beginning again. No way! My grandpa told me drama is like train journey. When it comes, it only comes once. You're just an artiste, how dare you talk like that! Who is organizing all this? Reddappa! He's spending crores. Don't embarrass artistes. lt was my mistake, l'll come on time next time. You carry on, please. He's a crook to the core. He's the man who drained out the Gangamma pond. You've been very brave, boy! You too have been very brave, magician. What's that? What you said now is blared over loud speaker! Hail Goddess Patala Bhairavi! Greetings. - Greetings. Why did you stop me, sir? l don't want any trouble here. Everyone's concentration must be on them and we must concentrate on arranged. Find the lady journalist immediately. Sir please give me two days. I'm sensing danger. lt's better you get out from there. l'm waiting for an important information. My officer who was working on leads given by you is missing since morning. Anyway, be careful. Boss? What brother didn't tell him, why should we tell him now? Forget it, madam. He was never sad for not having parents. He didn't even bother to ask their names. Why do you want to make him an orphan now? His birth place has been reduced to dust. lf l too die, his past would also get buried. He's not in a mood to care about all this. He's itching to go to America. Even if you tell him about his past, he'll brush it off lightly. What's the problem? Somebody has come and wants us to start the drama all over once again. Babu gave him a fitting reply. Where are you going? - Here comes Babu! Just see him and go away, Jogamma. She knows your grandpa very well. Greetings. My dear! May God bless you a long life! Bye, mother. Your act was very good, can you please give me your number? Here's your pant. - She wants your number. My phone number is... - Not yours but his. Are we not humans? Will be fans of tall, fair and handsome actors only? Women are heartless! A girl came to watch the drama. l'm talking about her and you're talking about girl... Remove that moustache, it seems Mysore girl is here to dance. lf l say yes, will you also say yes? Will you ask me to come and satiate your desire? Bellary Babu, come quickly... Mysore girl has come out of home for you... Come my dear...come.... Telugu! Come my King of Bobbili, how come you're so tall... You're hot like Sun... lf your eyes are so fiery, how can there be romance? You're a hot male who rakes up passionate desires in me... What sort of a lover are you to stop my advances? What do you lose to show the power and strength in your muscles? Hey colourful dream! You're indeed desirous... l'm a greenhorn in romance... You're a suave man to cheat with innocence... lf anyone refuses my invitation, he's foolish... What will you do otherwise? Babu, that girl is in exhibition. lf girls are alone... Prince charming will follow to romance... They come so close that their breath touches... They hit like hot summer breeze... Hey girl, you girls are embers... You trap boys and make them go mad with your beauty... Will you remember anyone after you cool off? You crush and throw away girls like bottle after having water... What? - Brother is calling, come. Come... - Go! Come l say! - Why are you taking me away? l'll come there at 1 , be ready. Brother, he's the man who talked bad about boss. l didn't find another man, brother. Shut up! lt seems you didn't start the drama again for Reddappa. You must board when train comes. Once it leaves, will it come back for you? lt won't! Whether it is Reddappa or anyone! Why are you hitting a drunk man, you bloody... Who is he? - Who? Our Babu? lf he comes... Will he hit us? - Hit you? How would it be if 60 harmoniums play at a time in high note? His punches would be like that! You'd get thrashed. Bloody! How dare you fold your tongue! lt's my tongue, my wish. Making me alone... What are you doing? Excuse me! - What do you want? Sorry, l asked are you free tonight to act in drama. You misunderstood me. Trust me, l asked to act in drama. Babu! - What? (please translate Telugu) Uncle! Where's the nearest hospital? There's a hospital in the next street also. Sir, l was waiting for you in the exhibition. lt's not safe there. Got any information about Chakravarthi. Till now we know only about iron ore mining. This is bench cutting. There's something which we don't know. Underground iron ore mining. Reddappa is into it also. You mean? For example Renukamma ghat is 200 acres of mining area, On face it looks like ordinary mining, but underground mining takes place. They dig up over 4000 acres. They dig up under homes, villages, farms... They make the earth hollow from under. Earth will die and soil will go to Reddappa. Alex, let's go to Renukamma Ghat tomorrow. Be ready by 8 am. - l won't come. lt's okay to cover the documentary but l can't put my life in risk. - Please, l need to go back. - Alex, we're this close. - No. I'm sorry. Sir, l want to lodge a complaint. - What happened? Some people cut the tongue of an artiste from my troupe. When? lnsurance problem of maid servant, sir. Look after well. - Okay, sr. Aren't you that drama guy? - Yes, sir. Didn't you see him while talking to Reddappa, tell him! Tell me. They cut the tongue of my troupe's artiste. Yes, l heard about it. lt seems he has tongue slip. l mean he got drunk fell flat on face and cut his tongue between teeth. lt didn't happen like that, sir. They brutally cut his tongue with a knife. Did you see it happen? Tongue has no bone so turns as it likes. You must keep it in control. He doesn't need anymore. Tell him to be happy, go! lt's not right for a police officer to say like that. l'll lodge a complaint, please take it. Will you take his complaint, Murthy? lt seems he won't take. - Why? ls he your relative? Blood relation or bed relation? Are you his pimp or is he your pimp? Are you calling me a pimp? How dare you! What the hell are you talking? He's talking without knowing you, l'll talk to him. Keep your tongue under control, this is station not stage. So what? You've come to beg for alms with make-up. Collect money and leave silently. You're collecting money, right? Collect it. How dare he! Do you know who you're confronting? Reddappa! Did he cut his tongue? Did he cut his tongue? He's a man, that's why he cut only the tongue. Had it been Reddappa, he would've cut his neck! Tell him! Whoever it is, he has scared you to death! Do one thing, quit police force and clean his toilets. l didn't do anything wrong, they're not taking my complaint. l'll not take your complaint, l'll not let you enter police station. Do whatever you can! Go! Go away! l'll find the man and cut his tongue. Go, if you go near him, he'll kill you. They cut his tongue brutally. Even if you have a tongue, you must live like a mute Till this nine day festival ends, stay out of trouble and leave the town. Got it? Take care. Stop! Tell Rathnaprabha to come. Guru is waiting here. Whose Guru? - Guru to Rathnaprabha. Last night l watched your drama, l could watch only for a minute. People were clapping, you thought they were clapping getting impressed. They were killing mosquitoes, you know that. You used only 7 emotions out of 9, why? Must have fallen somewhere. - Making fun of me? You're a good rock, to get into good shape, you need a good sculptor. Fall at my feet, place betel leaf in my hand, l'll sculpt you! l'm not Rampam. Why do young men like you don't understand me? You don't know what to talk and speak as you like! l'm already in very bad mood and may thrash anyone l see. Will you dare hit me? Will you hit this great actor? Will you dare hit this actor par worst? Dead! l know, you don't need a sculptor. Uncle, goons came and... Who dared to go to the police? Are you not happy with tongue cut? Have you become so arrogant for staying here? l'll cut everyone's, one by one! ls that the way to speak? Do you want me to cut yours? Shall l? Why are you manhandling a woman shamelessly? How dare you... - Brother.... Brother, it's not the way to speak to women. Shall l cut your neck? lf theatre artistes talk too much, this will be the result! Be happy for sparing you alive. What's that? Brother.... - What's that? Please don't do anything to it. That's my brother's mortal remains. Ash! lt's just ash for you. But it's responsibility for us. Please don't insult it. - What will you do with it? Artistes, right? Will you apply it on face? Please don't say like that. Ashes of artistes is holy like sacred ash of Lord Shiva. You may lose your eyes, son. Why are you delivering dialogues like playing a drama? We brought it to immerse in river Thungabhadra. Please leave it, brother. How will good deeds add to my credit if l spare it? l'll do one thing, l'll immerse it in river myself. River Thungabhadra runs in my body! lt flows perennially! Why are you sitting there? Get a bucket of water, l'll wash it clean. Please don't touch it. Please don't... lfwhat you intend to do becomes a burden you can't carry... lf a street dog defecates in sanctorum, God will not become dirty! If wishes die down.... The sighs of distress and hopelessness will overcome defeat... His name is Saida! lt'll churn the calm sea... Did you shave head well? Didn't remove moustache? - Please brother. lt seems you had a fight, Swamy. Why are you talking as if you don't know anything? He talked to him while leaving, l saw it. He wanted Rathnaprabha dance program tonight, l said l'll arrange, that's all. Das, please tell where can l find him? Why do you want to get into trouble with them? Elderly man is dead, if you also die, troupe will become orphan. Do you need this? - Tell me, where is he? Tell me, where can l find Saida? How do l know where would he be? - Nallacheruvu! What?

Nallacheruvu is mining area, what do you want to do there? l want to piss there, will you take me there? Piss wherever you want but pay my fare. You can pass urine wherever you want, it's free. l said free, don't make my car a toilet. l was going to Renukamma Ghat, but my car had a breakdown. How much more time? - l think it'll take time.

How far is Nallacheruvu? - 12 kms, madam. l'll take you there in an hour and half. Are you driving a bullock cart? l'll drive the car. Let me drive the car, it's not fair to let passenger drive the car. What? - l mean let me drive... Life is like an egg! Nobody knows which will become a chick and which will become an omelette. What? lf you drive like this, my life will end up as an omelette. lf you drive, one must have hope of living, do you get that hope, madam? Look at his driving. Tippu Sultan! You're saved! But my car is dead. Handling so roughly! Aren't you married? This is Nallacheruvu, right? - Yes, come back quickly. Hello, must look after car like wife. Unlike you! You're great! You're flying in air with public money. Reddappa, madam! He has over 100 crore property. Not in hundreds or thousands, he has a lakh crores. My grandpa Bude Sultan, he was tailor. He wanted to visit Mecca, he couldn't because of no money. My father Peer Sultan, he reached Allah before visiting Mecca. l'm Tippu Sultan, l'm saving money everyday to visit Mecca. l'm struggling to earn Rs.200 every day. Rs.1 lakh crores!?! God gave heart to the poor and money to the goons. To the dogs! l want to go to Renukamma ghat, will you stop any taxi going there? 1 lakh crores? lsn't it too much? l'll go up and take photos. 1 lakh crores? ls Saida there? - What? ls Saida there? - Saida?

Will you cut tongue? Will you urinate on it? Where will he be? Where? Tell me! Renukamma ghat! Are you really an artiste? You thrashed them brutally. For what they did, l mustn't thrash them, l must bury them alive. What if anyone dies there? - Why are they after you? l'm doing a documentary. I'm a media person. That's why. - Media? Reddappa is after iron ore and you're after audience. Mine it. Do you say media is wrong? Everyone comes to know about what's happening around because of media. Yes, they do come to know. How many teeth crow has? How much a donkey's egg weighs? Which dog is after which dog and where? That's all. Isn't it? Who wants all this nonsense? What do you mean? Media is a big circus. But circus has buffoons and here audience are buffoons. That's the only difference. I can't believe this. How can you call media a circus? Why are you getting late, Babu? Come fast. Meter is running, sir. We need to go to Renukamma ghat, start the car. Renukamma ghat? Come quickly. lf we mine deeper here, it'll create problem there. If water comes out here, why would that affect there? I don't know how you do it, 6000 trucks must go out. Very difficult to take trucks down there Water will log the mine. Workers may get stuck. Tell me, Raju. That drama guy came here, brother. - Who? The man who went to the police station. He came searching for you, he's coming to Renukamma ghat now. Coming here? Let him come. l'll finish him here. Who is manning check post? Madam! Are there really 1 lakh crores? If we change 1 lakh crores into coins and tell Reddappa to count, he's finished. He can't count it. Why are you bleeding? - For pissing in their area. Will they hit if anyone pisses there? That's what I said bro. You're a drama artiste, right? You came this far to piss, why are you going to Renukamma ghat now? For madam. What does madam do? She works for circus. Cracking jokes! Works for circus? Come closer. Do you know Gemini circus? - l saw. Madam works there. l can't believe it. Do l look like a theatre artiste? - No...no... Madam works for circus. Spicy girl... ls twisting magic?

Know the matter, it's not a thing to break immediately... l've a perfect body... Can't you take me like a he-man? l left you with pity on seeing your zero size... Are you calling that also my crime? Why that manliness if you can't pounce like a hungry lion? Don't incite me, l can't hold myself... Hover on me like cyclone and enjoy the bliss of happiness... Show your prowess, l'm ready for it... lf that's it, tale it as l'm here... Hey girl, watch out! l'll settle the accounts... l'll enchant you with my magic, l'll make you say wow... l'll create a new world for you... l'll consider you better than Harry Potter... l'll sing paeans about you... l'll make you hot like fire... l'll make you shiver like snow...

Don't have any second thoughts, O girl... l'll fulfill all your desires tonight.... l don't have any doubts after your assurance... l promise to give my heart and soul to you... l've named my car after my first girl friend's name. Please handle it smoothly. This is Gangamma pond, right? Just for namesake, no Gangamma or pond. They mined out everything. You say you're new to this area but how do you know so many old things? This is my grandfather's hometown. lt was forest area once, they've made it barren with mining operations. ls this native place of your grandpa too, madam? Wonder of mining, Tippu. lf you mine earth here, you can make money. Do you know to drive car? Do you know to drive car? - Nothing will happen. Noting will happen? - What happened now? lf l drive, only car sound comes. But if you drive, everything makes sound. Why would it make sound if you drive? You don't know to drive at all. Look, is there any damage. - Not that l don't know to drive. l don't want to drive my Razia too fast. Will you drive as you like because you're tall! Get into the car. - Drive slow.- Brother! Brother! lsn't it you who hit the car with a catapult? You didn't hit my car buy my dear Razia. So, l'll take revenge on you. Eye for an eye, ear for an ear. Tooth for tooth. Hole for hole. l'll make a hole on you too. You little devil! He's just a kid. - Little devil! My grandma is crying since last night. Grandma! Do you know me, mother? So many years have passed...

You, your husband and your child are one, right? l'm different from you, right? l'm a loner! Tears rolled down.... ln the form of poison... l ran long distance carrying you. l was afraid of getting caught. Subrahmanyam said he'll raise you. lt seems your father helped him earlier. He killed my husband too along with your parents. l ran away from here and lived elsewhere. l came here to spend my last years. They've reduced this place to nothing. What happened to Chakravarthi? - Some said he's dead. Few others say he ran away from here. Can you recognize him now? He was thin and quite young 25 years ago. Face changes when one grows old, right? Maybe l'll recognize if l see him. Now l know why your grandpa wanted his ashes to be immersed here. May be you'll offer obsequies to your dead parents too along with him. Will you do it, son? Why are so many police here? Are you really a theatre artiste? lsn't there any other way, Tippu? We can go from that side, madam. We can go but have to get down the hill. Devika, stay here, we'll come back. Stay here? Hey, tall man! Pay my fare, man! l need to go to Mecca. My money!

We faced a problem in Pallamettu junction. The mine we dug has got water logged. About 100 workers would be dead. They're dead, what should we do now? We must take out the bodies. What will you do with it? Will you take a procession of bodies? Saida, go! l don't know how you do it. Work must start in 30 minutes. Okay, sir. Come. Minister! You cleared the forest area. Drag him to me! Who sent you? Tell me! Who gave you the weapons? Tell me! Chakravarthi! Your father couldn't kill me.

He came in search of Saida for cutting his uncle's tongue. Will he go after anyone if he's angry? This dance hall is becoming our bedroom, right? Not only this night, it'll become our bedroom for all the following nights. Does he know that lady journalist? As far as l know nothing like that.

Even if our lives are getting burnt, we must celebrate festivals. But the demon who ruined our lives is still alive. Reddappa! We'll celebrate after his death. Whether Goddess Mother killed demon or Rama killed Ravana, did we see them do it? We celebrate the death of a bad man! Let it be Reddappa or any bad man, we must celebrate festival with hope that any bad man will die. How is it possible? On festival day, they burn down the demon. Tonight break his head and celebrate the festival. Will you break his head, kiddo? Did you recognize me? lt's me, you came when our forest was burnt down. Did you recognize me?

Let him be anywhere, don't spare him. - Okay, sir. Come here. Everyone comes to act in drama. Why are you just circling? Why are you posing like puppy? How romantic should angels of love be! Search everywhere, don't leave any room. lf you find, get that tall actor. Where's Babu? Where is Babu? - Don't know, sir. Who is sir? Why an actor is indulging in fights?

Has your anger eased? Babu told me not to stop the winged birds from flying. Keep flying! Babu, that's the difference between your generation and my generation. When we didn't have freedom, we got it through struggle, Now also we don't have freedom. But you people are flying away to places where there is freedom. You say my life my freedom. Birds and animals can live anywhere. But we're humans, nitjust us, the place where we live must prosper and our neighbour too. You don't understand that. Wait here, jeeps will pass this way. - Okay. Look, how beautiful this place is! They'll dig up this place too! How would Chakravarthi look like? Let's talk to Prasad. May be he has information. Can l meet him? What's the connection between Pattabhi and Chakravarthi? Missed him by a whisker. He knows you're alive. l must kill him at any cost. Kill him! l must kill him! If we miss him today, we can never get him again. He'll become alert. We must kill him at any cost. We'll not miss him this time. ls it enough? Mines blaster! lt can reduce hills into dust. His life depends on it, he's nothing to it. not just Reddappa, another man too asked if Chakravarthi is alive. Who? Will your problem get solved if you kill Chakravarthi? lt'll get solved, my problem is my anger. lf anyone dies, we break a pot. l did the same in forest. They saw Reddappa in it and l saw Chakravarthi in it. lf l find him, l'll kill him. Would Prasad help to reach Chakravarthi? You helped her thinking she's a journalist. But she's giving leads to CBl. How can you be so naive to help people you don't know, Prasad? Would you like to smoke a cigarette? What else Devika knows about me? She knows everything. From the days you started doing small business along with Chakravarthi. Till now when you've earned Rs.1 lakh crores. She knows your entire criminal history. Not only she knows about your mining operations, she knows about your underground mining operations too. She knows everything? Did she meet Chakravarthi? - She didn't meet him yet. May be there's an opportunity to meet him. What about Babu, that theatre artiste? What's his connection with Devika? Babu? What's the connection between him and Devika? l met the young man in police station. He was like gold burning in fire. He's fearless. Media person, better to clear it quickly. lf not we'll face problem. Okay, sir. Did you see? Constable, get down the body. ls he Prasad? l met him in police station. Good man, poor man! We must feel pity seeing few people's death. We must feel proud. Devika here, sir. They killed Prasad. Got the information just now. lt's not safe for you to be there. l'm coming to Bangalore now. Don't spare Reddappa. lnformation l've with me is more than enough Come immediately. l'm leaving straight away. Babu, we must meet Tippu now. My bag and laptop are in his taxi. lt has all the important information. - No, Devika. Are you scared they'd kill me also? Why do you think they killed Prasad? For helping you. Would Reddappa leave you? Don't you get angry on seeing all this? l do get angry on reading newspaper every day. Today's paper won't come tomorrow, today's anger won't last till tomorrow. Other news and other anger. But you said so many things in forest. You told them to save their anger also. l said that with anger on Chakravarthi. Listen! Reddappa ruined their lives. l wish they must get Reddappa. l don't want to take him to them. Do you want me to watch silently if he steals natural wealth? Who is not stealing? Everyone is stealing what he can lay his hands on. Who can't do it is cribbing over it? Every common man thinks like me, you got it? Look at Reddappa! He got an opportunity, he's stealing. Some think we were born after our mother carried us in her womb for 9 months. Few others think we were born after she slept with father. Both are true. But one who sees the labour pain becomes human. One who see the pleasure becomes beast. You told me to leave him easily. Can you give up your anger on Chakravarthi? You'll understand when it comes to you. Someday, it'll come to you. You'll leave anything, right? Leave me also. lf you don't come, l'll arrest your entire troupe. l'll thrash them on streets and take them to station. l'll strip them naked and hit without showing any difference between men and women. Are you playing drama with police? l'll book a case of running prostitution in the name of drama troupe. He was having food, they took him for discussion. You killed him brutally and hanged his dead body. Arrest Reddappa! Arrest Reddappa, kill him on road and hang his dead body. Journalist Prasad's wife, she's creating scene here to hang Reddappa. lt was suicide and there was suicide note also. lt wasn't a suicide. They killed him and hang his body. Did you see? Do you've evidence? What evidence you need than his dead body? There's no evidence, go away. What are you looking at? Checking if she's useful to your drama troupe. Will you give her heroine role? How dare you hit Reddappa's men and live here? Go inside. Sit there. You hit Reddappa's men! My husband gave his life for people like you only. You do the post mortem sir, l'll prove he was killed. Are you his wife? Are you ready to see your husband's body getting split into pieces? Are you a woman? My husband's body isn't new to me? His life and death, both are mine. l must know the truth. Do the post mortem. Your daughter? She'll also die tomorrow. Whether she was raped before death or not, will you ask for post mortem... How dare you slap me! Didn't she give you one tight slap before death? lsn't that enough for her death to be justified? Gowda! Where is he? Where's that drama actor? lsn't it you who took him from my home? What did you do with him? - What's this? Tie her up. Sit! Where is Devika? - l don't know. Anything between you both? l thought there's some background behind you. lt seems you're an orphan. lt seems theatre artistes disperse after the drama is over. lt seems your troupe won't be there at all. What do you lose if we cut his tongue? What Saida did is wrong! Take money and forget it. Play your drama tonight and leave the town by morning. Take it. Take the money. Take it. Take the money, use it yourself or give it to the victim. Take it and go away. People here must live their own life only. Should bother about what's happening around. lf you do, l'll cut your entire troupe and bury them under the stage. Go, live elsewhere! Why did you leave him? - He's also like us. But he has no clarity. Whatever is happening is deceit... World is full of cheats only... There's only pied piper to cheat all others... You're time and time is you... King can become ordinary man and vice versa... Tricks and magic in market, this world belongs to the brave... Take on the world head on, the world will ask where are you... Why did you stop? Go on. l did, Tippu. - What? l'm not blind. You must fill for 80 paise more. Fill it. Just two drops only for 80 paise. Will you stop urinating just because it's two drops only? Why did you stop the diesel then? Take Rs.100, return my 80 paise change. Take it tomorrow. You'll never change, l curse you get ruined. Allah! The girl is back! Why are you hiding from me? Madam, if CM comes, only police follows him. But if you come, police, goons and guns follow me. l forgot my bag in your taxi. ls it there? Not just your bag, you forgot to pay my fare also. Do you remember that? l'll pay you, is my bag safe? Bag is safe, what happened to Amitabh Bachchan? The man who came with you. Madam, check your bag. l'll never touch ladies bag. l need to reach Bangalore, will you take me there? Bangalore? Will you pay? Then, let's go, madam. Stop here. Get down slowly. Careful! How are you? Fine? Babu? That long hair guy went to bring him. You come in. Swamy! Are you coming at 4 or not? ls Babu coming or not? Tell me if he's coming or not. Don't worry if anyone comes or not, l'm here, right? Personalities like me suit for any role. Like NTR of films, and l in theatre. Guru, greetings. - Greetings. Are you fine, sir? Never in dream also you thought of acting me, right Rathnaprabha? That's it! This is an historic incident. Do you've pen and paper? - No. Go home and write in your diary. You can read it often in future. Hey Babu! Why that electric pole is walking in? He should've run away, right? - He's not of runaway types. He's one who makes others to run away. Make an entry in your diary, allow us to stage our plays. Veeraraju, Babu is coming. She too retorted! Mustn't stay here, better to leave this place. Babu, entire town is in chaos. Are you staging the play? Where did you go? - Why are you calling now? Police are combing for you. How did you come here? Are you staging the play today evening or not? How can we? He has gone silent. He walked in just now. My fate! We must stage the play, grandpa. We must play the drama. l came here to stage this play. But l'm experiencing it. l thought grandpa was carried away by the claps! No! Even if 100 people are clapping, at least on in the audience watches the play silently and thinks this is real. Grandpa staged the plays for that one man! l've understood now that l'm that one man! Grandpa wrote this play for me. Jogamma came here, right grandpa? Why didn't you tell me my past? He raised me like his own child. l used to say one must live his own life. l made a mistake, uncle. lf grandpa had been alive, l feel like falling at his feet saying sorry. l want to relive all those 25 years again. Hello camera madam, doing circus feats in car also. Circus is going to Bangalore, where's that theatre heading to? Can't you drive faster than this? Faster than this? You've insulted me, madam. Crossed 40, want to go faster than this, madam? Open the door! He has left. Hey old man! - Watch out! Stop... Nothing happened to him, Tippu. Didn't get hurt, did you grandpa? Check if he's alive or dead, madam. Go carefully. Okay or not? Tell me, what happened to him? Nothing happened to him, Tippu. Tell him never to cross road again. Come! Kill him boys! Don't leave anyone! What's this? What is happening here? Devika, leave this place immediately. l'll not leave without meeting Chakravarthi. Who are you? Are you Chakravarthi? You're Chakravarthi, right? - So what? Reddappa will die today, that is going to happen here, take it down. Who will kill you then? You're also a criminal, right? You killed your sister and brother-in-law. - Did l? Babu is your nephew. He's ready to kill you and become a criminal. Then, tell him to come here. Call him here. We both together can kill Chakravarthi He took away my life from me, the man who killed his parents. He's living my life. l'm not Chakravarthi! He's the real Chakravarthi! l'm Reddappa!
