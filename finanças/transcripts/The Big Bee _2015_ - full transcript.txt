August 8th, 1995. 7:21AM Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture "CH-50J Delivery Ceremony" "Nishiki Heavy Industries" Came for the ceremony. ID please. "Employee ID - Kazuaki Yuhara" I've got permission for them. Show me. "Atsuko Yuhara" "Takahiko Yuhara" Family outing, eh? I envy you. Go ahead. He didn't know you. This plant's under Defense Ministry control. But you made the heli. This is "Parents Day" for you. Hey Takahiko, when's your Parents Day? I'll go next time. Last month. The "Big B" delivered today is 34 meters long, and weighs 25 tons. We've built Japan's biggest helicopter. Are we too early? There was a freeway accident. A traffic jam... Yes, yes, you're right, dear. Stop that. Stop that! Ow! It's OK. It's OK. Take a puff. Alright? Let's go, Keita. That's coffee. It's for Dad. I'll use the bathroom, so you go back. You weren't at home because you put your heart and soul into Big B, as an engineer. These five years taught me. An engineer's home is a desk and a chair. If you separate, what happens to Takahiko? He's better off with Atsuko. I'll never be a good father to him. Come on, let's go back! We'll get in trouble! Isn't this dangerous? Nah. I've seen lots of helis. Wow. This is so cool. Let's go! Keita! Get up! Ow! Ow! Where's Takahiko? Wasn't he with you? Keita too. Damn him... Takahiko! Don't worry. They'll be back. Yuhara?! "Ramp Emergency Stop" You OK? Let's get out of here! Hurry! Let's go! Hurry! Let's go, Keita! Hurry! Keita! Takahiko! Jump out! Takahiko! Yuhara! Keita! Takahiko! Takahiko, jump! Takahiko! Takahiko! Takahiko! Takahiko! Takahiko! Jump! Takahiko! Trust me! Takahiko! Takahiko! Takahiko! Takahiko! Takahiko! Shinyo fast-breeder nuclear plant "Plant Chief Kazumi Nakatsuka" Breaking news. At 8am today in Komaki City, Aichi, at Nishiki Heavy Industries' Komaki aviation plant, the CH-50J, a new helicopter for the Ministry of Defense, was stolen by unknown means. The hijacker has sent faxes to relevant organizations. To all concerned. I have stolen SDF helicopter Big B. It is now hovering above the Shinyo fast-breeder nuclear plant in Tsuruga City, Fukui Prefecture. When its fuel runs out, it will crash into the reactor. With its massive payload of explosives. There is only way to avert this. Abandon all nuclear plants within Japan. Specifically, destroy their turbines and render them nonfunctional. However, do not attempt to stop Shinyo. If Shinyo's reactor shuts down, I will drop Big B on it. Its fuel will run out in eight hours, at 4pm. I expect you to act wisely. THE BIG BEE THE BIG BEE "Nishiki Heavy Industries" "Stinger in the Sky"? A giant bee's got its stinger pointing right at us. The cockpit was empty. Security cameras only showed Takahiko and Keita. How could Big B be remotely controlled? It's Japan's first Fly-By-Wire... It's computer piloted, using electronic signals. How is that good? That heli has an AFCS... Automatic Flight Control System. Program it in advance, and it can fly on autopilot. Don't you dare say evacuation's necessary. If we panic and evacuate the area, we'll cast doubt on the safety of nuclear power! Yes sir, but if the heli is carrying explosives... Listen, you. Think of Rokkasho! Rokkasho? The reprocessing plant? After all that trouble, construction's finally begun. We don't want debate to reignite over this! Of course, I believe in its safety too. As an engineer. We're being victimized! When the police, the fire service, or whoever comes sniffing, say as little as necessary. Tokyo controls the flow of information. Yes sir. Yes sir. We're ready to SCRAM at anytime. We can't, unless the heli looks like it'll fall. Understood. If we do, we'll prioritize cooling the reactor core. Just like in a simulation. Leave the control room to me. Continuing from Tokyo, over to the National Police Agency. To the "Stinger in the Sky." Pay attention. As we revealed, a grade school boy, Takahiko Yuhara, is trapped within the helicopter you've hijacked. I'm sure this was unintentional. We hope that you will fly the helicopter to a safe location immediately and spare his life. If there is anything preventing you from doing so, please contact us. We are prepared to assist in any... What? Over to your questions. The gentleman in the front. Matsumoto, NHN. Will the demand to abandon nuclear plants be ignored? That is being debated, but I can say that non-compliance is the P.M.'s stance. The hijacking had two stages. Manual extraction from the hangar. By someone with experience. Then it must have been switched to AFCS mode. Autopilot. If the demand's met, how'll they pilot it? New commands will be transmitted. They've converted its system. Your heli's waiting. They converted it after testing last night? In theory, yes. If they know AFCS systems. Take me too. Don't be silly. I want to be there! I'm sorry, you can't. It's dangerous. I know, so take me! We're going because we designed it. To save Takahiko. I'm sorry. Stop the plants! Shut 'em down! Trash the plants! Tear 'em down! To all workers and students here! The government's pro-nuke power policy that created Shinyo is clearly to blame for what's happening here today! Hear hear! Let's renew our vow to fight nuke power... Panic buying's cleared the stores. What's this? You wanted a cream bun. This is just a bun with cream in it. Not a cream bun. Stop the plants! Trash the plants! Close enough. Stop the plants! You got no eye for detail. Get a haircut. You'll keep. Trash the plants! Tear 'em down! Trash the plants! Tear 'em down! "Activists" "Name List" First, we investigate activists from this prefecture. They ain't from here? You're a Tsuruga boy. Parents evacuated? Dad's a councilman. The plant's been a blessing. Like they say, "Live by plutonium..." Already gave up on running, huh. Go. We're leaving! We can't fly within a one click radius of Big B. A police car'll drive you. There it is. I knew something like this'd happen someday. I mean, this kind of fast-breeder reactor is riskier than a regular one. We never needed it. That's shallow thinking. Mishima? I'd better explain. With commercial light water reactors and this fast-breeder, the major difference is fuel. Light water reactors use uranium-235. But it only comprises 0.7% of natural uranium. The other 99.3% is uranium-238, which is unusable as fuel. However, neutron fission turns this into plutonium-239. Fast-breeder reactor fuel. It breeds more energy than it uses, providing fuel for millennia. We've worked on it for over 10 years, and began trials this year. When it enters commercial service, we here will be long gone. But to avoid future energy crises, trial and error is vital now. Don't understand? Fine. I'm used to that. This is Koichi Mishima of Nishiki's plant division. I had him join us because he's Shinyo's designer. Good to have you. Why'd you come? One Big B expert is enough. Listen, my son's on board. So what use are you here? Lack of composure could be fatal. Go home to Atsuko. As we know little about the explosives, we are preparing for all possibilities. However, if, and I mean if, an explosive event were to occur, significant radioactive material would not be released. Our nuclear plants have numerous safeguards. If one is breached, another exists. And another after that. They are protected by "defense-in-depth." Aren't you worried about internal destruction? That's unlikely. But you don't know how big its payload is. Well, we've run blast tests on the reactor housing, which withstood the equivalent of 100 kilograms of TNT. What measures will be taken if it's seriously damaged? Listen, I'm saying it won't be seriously damaged. If the heli hits the reactor, will it shut down immediately? If the system's disrupted, control rods drop, stopping it instantly. We'll withdraw control room staff. If "defense-in-depth" fails, they're our last bastion. Wasn't this built on the basis it wouldn't fail? It was. Quit jerking around. We'll never abandon Shinyo. Never mind your loyalty. This is about minimizing loss of life. Let's say, the container's damaged, radiation leaks out, and we lose control. Mishima... There's nothing we can do, so we evacuate. A worst case scenario. All residents of this area must be evacuated. A 250-kilo radius. Okayama, Kobe, Osaka, Kyoto, Nagoya, Yokohama, Kawasaki, western Tokyo. We may have to abandon this area for centuries. This is just a theory. Chief Nakatsuka is fully aware of that possibility. Please understand. But where do they go if the heli falls?! I need to assign my men to the control room. I can't tell them to go to their deaths. No... They could shelter here. The reactor container is the strongest structure. A jumbo jet couldn't breach it. Isn't the reactor beneath it? It's safer than going outside. If it's breached, there's no escape anyway. You're right. Not a bad idea. Excuse me. How long would this take? Running at full speed, one minute. One minute? Big B falling from 800 meters would take... ...10 seconds. How long until the control rods drop? In a SCRAM, under two seconds. There, there! That lower level looks safe. Not with spent nuclear fuel. And it'll take longer than eight seconds. I know. Shit! If auto-rotation's possible... Auto-rotation? Normally, when a heli runs out of fuel, wind drives the rotors in a landing. But we can't steer. The hijacker's using a remote control, right? Couldn't you two make one as well? We can guess how they've rejigged Big B, but not for sure. If we could only see inside the cockpit... They'll be watching. If you can hear me, press the button under the red light and respond. Takahiko, can you hear me? If you can hear me, press the button under the red light. This is the police. Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? If you can hear me, press the button under the red light on the console. This is the police. Takahiko, can you hear me? Takahiko, can you hear me? If you can hear me, press the button under the red light on the console. Yuhara, this was found on the plant's grounds. Takahiko Yuhara Any response? No. Not yet. Has a heli ever fallen on a plant before? We've done simulations. One scenario was a U.S. F-16 crashing into Rokkasho. The enrichment facility's walls hold up. The storage facility would be damaged, with only 0.06 REM leakage. That means it would be safe. F-16s are equipped with missiles and bombs. Simulate that? No, only without bombs. Without bombs? An F-16?! If it was on a training mission. That's meaningless! We now bring you breaking news. The hijacker has just issued another message, in response to Police Agency Director General Ashida. If the following demand is met, the hostage will be freed. "Shut down all nuclear plants now, excluding Shinyo." "Shut down all nuclear plants now, excluding Shinyo." What's your take on this? Well, the prior demand was to disable nuclear plants, so this could be interpreted as a concession. The hostage will be freed on these conditions. "1: Broadcast the rescue plan on television. "2: No one shall enter the helicopter, "and the child shall take nothing from inside it. "3: Only one helicopter may be used in the transfer. "Any failure to comply and Big B will crash. "When shutting down reactors, send TV crews to control rooms, Mrs. Yuhara! "to broadcast live. Stinger in the Sky." Our orders are to plan a rescue with the engineers. This is unprecedented. Understood. Anybody living near a nuke plant would never do that! Detective, if you're from Tsuruga, you know that! Even so, Tsuruga people wanted the plant, didn't they? They wanted the money. But you know, the real boneheads ain't the locals. It's the city folk who paid for it. They don't know nothing. They use nuke power just to run an electric toothbrush. News just to hand. A conference has just been held, and the government has decided to shut down all reactors. In order to conserve power, large companies have been asked to switch to night shifts. Take a break for now. We're saving power. To save power, the elevators are out of service. Please use those stairs. Why's the AC turned off? Sorry. In compliance with the hijacker's demand, we will broadcast the shut-downs. Switching live now to the Kashiwagi Nuclear Plant. Control room here. Five hours to 4pm. Reactor 1 is about to be shut down. Reactor 1, SCRAM. Five seconds to SCRAM. 4, 3, 2, 1, SCRAM! That gave me a scare... One button push can stop them? If the cooling system's operational, they can be stopped like that. Right, Nakatsuka? Right. The government acted promptly for once. Sakuma. Check on sodium fire procedures. For a crash during the rescue. Prepare for the worst. Hey. Yuhara's here... So what? How could a father lose sight of his son? He's a victim! Like hell he is! He caused this. It's your heli that's being used against us! It is dangerous. But not as much... ...as a nuclear plant. You used our electricity to make that heli! Big B was made for rescues in inaccessible places! Only you think that. Big B has fuel to hover for eight hours. A 1,600 kilometer range. It can cross the sea and return. What'll it carry overseas? Doctors? Food? Hell no. Think! What?! Back off, Yamashita! Right now, I'm powerless. But with a nuclear expert like you, I can end this, and save Takahiko too! We're fathers! Please! Please help me! A man who endangers his son is no father. A security guard says a washing machine-sized crate behind the hangar went missing three days ago. An order slip was attached, so he ignored it. A washing machine-sized load of explosives. Only Nishiki employees have those slips. No, if it's an inside job, it would've been hidden better. Whoever left the crate has been unknowingly made an accomplice. By an outsider. OK, I hang off now. See, Akamine? Lucky you canceled your day off. We're stuck here. Wow, this is awful. I just can't get a break. Here, sorry to keep you waiting. Sergeant Negami, Pilot. Staff Sergeant Kamijo, Air Rescue. Yuhara? Nishiki Heavy Industries? That's me. Over here. You can't go in. How will you save him? We're considering various possibilities. You made that heli. What's stopping you? I'm an engineer. Not a lifesaver. So you abandoned him? Kazuaki. Why didn't you climb in with him? You won't take responsibility for things you can't control 100%. No? I'm sorry. Don't apologize! Fight! You never change! You won't fight for me or Takahiko! Families are about compassion! You say that because you only watch us from a distance! A family is something you bleed for, and suffer for, before it becomes yours! It's your turn to bleed for us! Takahiko's been waiting for that! That boy, he's been studying morse code. I kept quiet so he could surprise you. Is that because... January 17th. As he shook in front of the TV, you said to him. Whatever happens, wherever, if you do this, I'll find you. It's magic. "I" "I'm" "I'm h" "I'm he" "I'm here" I'm here... He... He was trying to talk to you! Ready sir. OK. "Taka" "Takahiko" "Takahiko" Response detected! He's using a work light! Ta...ka...hi...ko. That's it! Mr. Yuhara, ask about the heli. Got it. "What...do...you...see...inside" C...r...a...t...e. "How big" Wash...ing...mach...ine. Washing machine... Could be explosives! Don't touch! "Do...not...touch" "We...will...rescue...you" "Wait...for...me" Yoshiyuki Tanabe died a year and a half ago. A year after he quit sub-contracting for Kinki Electric. Leukemia? Yeah, that's it. You again, Detective? We've got nothing to do with the anti-nuke power activists. We just want an admission that Yoshiyuki's work killed him. Of course you do. So tell us more. This is all of it. Leave when you're done. When you held demos, was there anybody who went too far, or acted strangely? Strangely? No, there wasn't. We'll take a look. How old does he look? He was only 27 years old. What's this thing that Yoshiyuki's holding? Oh. I don't know. A radio-controlled car? Oh! He said someone he met at the plant got him hooked. Yes, he called him his "radio-control guru." Do you know his name? Saika... Saigawa, maybe. Yes, come to think of it... He always took these with him. To the hijacker. Your demands have been met. All nuclear plants excluding Shinyo have been safely shut down. People are complaining about our stupid heli. Our phones are jammed. We can't work like this. Say some outside expert on helis did this. How would they reprogram Big B? Use an engineering facility workstation... Entry method? Pass I.D. card check, fill in their destination... Get the visitor logs! On the double! It's gone high! Wow! I've been told the hijacker has responded. I'll now read their new message. "You may remove the child." The hijacker has approved a rescue. Now an SDF team will be sent to retrieve Takahiko. However, rescuing a person from a hovering helicopter is unprecedented, and problematic... Damn, it's hot in here too! Can't live without nuclear power. My makeup's a total mess. Hey, is it true about the heli carrying explosives? According to the girl who the police talked to, there's a crate on board as big as a washing machine. Anyway, what a crappy thing to do. The nuclear thing, and abducting a kid? So twisted. When they catch the guy, he's toast. 4:00 remaining A rescue like this is unheard of! We can't fly above Big B. There's no choice but to use the rear crane. Using the crane or the hoist, with Big B's downwash, we can't get close. Its downwash is below it. You can get as close as seven meters. You're the engineer? Big B constantly maneuvers to stay upwind, right? The downwash will hit us below. We need 30 meters... I've calculated the risk! You want us both to crash?! I have to save that boy! This isn't my field, but... No, that's... You're kidding me! The rescue plan has just been announced. An SDF heli will take off toward Big B, over Shinyo. It will hover behind Big B's open loading bay, and contact Takahiko. Yuhara's counting on us. Do your best. I'm amazed the top brass agreed to it. Nobody could've predicted this. They had no choice. Maizuru reports the wind at 2,600 feet is 270 degrees, 20 knots. We're gonna shake. Roger that. That's a big bird... "Firing...rope" "Message...attached" "Do...what...it...says...We'll...save...you" "Stand...back" In order to rescue Takahiko, a line-throwing gun will be used. It will shoot a hook, throwing a rope between the two helis. A message with the rescue plan is attached to the hook. This circus-style rescue is unprecedented. I can't see how it can succeed. It's extremely hot in Fukui. Air warmed by the sea blows inland, creating updrafts. Adiabatic cooling forms clouds, which leads to thunderstorms and squalls. The rescue will be extremely difficult. All we can do is hope. The SDF heli is now hovering behind Big B. It's in the hands of the SDF's top rescue team, but this is a first for them. Sergeant! Can you get closer? The downwash is bad. We do it here, or we crash. Roger that. Oh no! It looks like they've missed! The rope barely, barely missed Big B! Rotor downwash is strong! Aim higher! Roger that. Oh no. The hook has hit Big B's tail and bounced off. It seems to have grazed its rear rotor. It's no good! We hit a rotor, we both go down! We can't give up! We'll hit a rotor! That kid's more scared! They've got one shot left. If they miss, they'll have to land and reload. This would could further endanger Takahiko. However, winds are increasing, and clouds are closing in. Hurry, Kamijo! Open wide! You monster! The rope has reached Big B! The helis are linked! Magnificent! The media here are cheering! Their last shot has connected with Big B! Oh no! Stay back! Don't! What's going on? Takahiko is climbing the heli's wall. This is unplanned. And unexpected. It seems the hook is caught on a crane. Stay back! Could it be that he's trying to unhook it? It seems he's OK. I don't know what happened, but Takahiko's OK. Now the second stage of the rescue begins. A diagram of the rescue plan is attached to the hook. It explains how to operate Big B's crane. Takahiko must operate the crane and extend its line, then connect it to the rope fired from the SDF heli. The success of this mission is now in Takahiko's hands. Big B's crane line has reached the SDF heli. A rescue team member will cross to Big B. But clouds are closing in fast. Kamijo! Hurry, or the mist will... Clouds now cover the sky. Both helis have disappeared within them. What on earth is happening? Will the cloud cover hinder the rescue? No room for error. Release the line! But... It'll hit the rotors! It's no good! Release it! It'll send us both down! Kamijo! It'll hit it! Let go! Kamijo! He jumped! He jumped! A rescue team member! Unbelievable! The line's swaying! It's swaying, wildly! Like a trapeze act! This is history in the making! Shit! Reel me in! The swaying's stopped. He's being lifted upwards. Takahiko is using the crane to pull him closer to Big B. Takahiko, stop! Well done! Takahiko! I can't go in. Can you come to me? You won't pilot this? We'll parachute down. Grab on to me. Don't tell anybody I peed myself. I peed myself too. Hurry! Wind's increasing! Grab on! He fell from the heli! Takahiko! What on earth's happening?! I can't tell! I can't see! What's going on? Clouds are obstructing my view! I can't see! A parachute is descending from the clouds. Slowly. They've done it! He's safe! Takahiko is safe in his rescuer's arms! They're descending toward Shinyo. This is incredible. We're witnessing a miracle! Don't worry now. Just hold on tight. Takahiko's rescue has succeeded. The rescue is a success! A brilliant success! We're safe! Takahiko! Takahiko! Be strong! Over here! Takahiko! Takahiko! Takahiko! Takahiko, I'm sorry. You did great! Sir, we'll take him. Please step back. Takahiko! Takahiko! I'm his mom! He has asthma! Please step back. Lift him in. I'm coming too! Mr. Yuhara. Thank you! It's nothing, sir. He's a fighter! The hijacker is now demanding nuclear plants be destroyed. "Take notice." "Destroy the turbines of all offline nuclear plants." Impossible. Damn right it is. They can't wreck them all with only three hours left. No, I meant the hijacker can't be a radio control geek. An amateur couldn't pull this off... Do your damn job! Sorry. I gotta admit though, this is too much for my old eyes. Go through that, and read all the names to me. Shut down Shinyo? But you said we couldn't. Nakatsuka. You saw the news on TV. If the hijacker's caught, they could retake the heli. You really think they'll catch him within three hours? Surely... Within three hours? And eliminate all nuclear plants? No. Then the heli will fall on Shinyo at 4pm. An operational reactor. Therefore, don't you think shutting down Shinyo before that is a viable option? If we do... ...Big B will fall! No. The hijacker won't know if the reactor shuts down. There's only one way to detect a shutdown from outside. To cool steam from the active reactor's turbine, this pump circulates sea water. Heated wastewater is discharged at 70 tons per second, but when the reactor stops, it does too. If the hijacker's watching somewhere, we can't stop it. If they're out at sea. No. Temperature's not important. Water coming out is. If our other pump discharges seawater, they'll never know. You'll trick them. You'll trick everyone. To protect lives. And to protect the reactor. I'm not against stopping the reactor. I just want to make sure we're all ready to accept complicity in this. We must be ready, to protect Shinyo. By any means. This is... ...quite a gamble. Even if the odds are against us, we have to try. "Hirasawa." "Matsushima." "Yoshizumi." "U...rushibara." "Zakka." Or is it "Zoga"? "Kawai." Sekine... Good job, son. What did I do?! I get it. "Steal the Nation," huh?! A video game? Don't you watch TV dramas? It's read "Saika"! 2:42 remaining "Masao Haraguchi" Mr. Haraguchi came twice. But on this day, he was hospitalized with an injury. But I know Mr. Haraguchi. I'd recognize an impostor! Then who wrote their name here?! Gimme that. Is this a copy? Does it matter? Get the original. Who has access to these?! They're written in pencil. Someone must have altered it. Who's able to do that? Only General Affairs Section staff can enter. From the outside, can the transformers' cooling fans be seen? Can't see how. The angle obscures them. Well, I'd better make sure, just in case. What's wrong? There's a chance that the hijacker is watching the fans, not the wastewater. As you can see, they're not visible from outside. Mishima. Why'd you come? The fans turn in response to... No. Why'd you come today? I came to work. That's all. Because you remembered? That day. Mrs. Yuhara, are you OK? We're here. If you hadn't come, they'd have died. She's 38 weeks along. Anyone would've. No. If you hadn't gone to help Atsuko, she wouldn't have gotten up. I'll say this. If I'd been in your position, I wouldn't have left her to work. I know. I was an idiot. I chose my job. But today I realized why. Back then, I was running away from becoming a father. That responsibility... ...frightened me. Even so, I've always tried to protect them. But I didn't think it through. How painful it would be, if I lost them. If you realized that today, I'm glad. Power switched. Power switched. Roger. Chief, the auxiliary pump is ready. Good. Now then, first of all, begin testing the auxiliary pump at 1:45pm. If it's fine, we shut down. Yes sir. Chief! An email from Stinger in the Sky! I'll put it up. Open this and put it on screen. What the hell's that? Oh no... Deputy Chief. Thank you for your help. Step back. That's it! That's... They're monitoring the entire plant! Does Big B have an infrared camera and analyzer? No, it shouldn't. Then why was this sent? Look at these numbers! X is the discharge temperature! Y is for the intake! Normally they're six degrees different! They won't be if the reactor stops. Big B's being used to watch us? The auxiliary pump will change the water temperature in... ...one minute. Nishioka. The pump? Yes, it's working fine. Shut it off! Big B'll crash! New order! Shut down the auxiliary pump! Do it now! Pump stopped! He's now in hospital, and is resting. News just in. After Takahiko boarded Big B, the hijacker demanded nuclear plants be stopped instead... It's not me! It's not me! Sorry. I know, I know... One minute! With each second, its fuel level drops lower... We're out of ideas. No. The hijacker has... ...shown their hand. One minute. Till they know the reactor's off. Take shelter then. Where? The reactor container. What?! Nakatsuka has given us permission. Yuhara, let's check the video again. Why did the hijacker let us know? It's as if they don't want to kill anyone. They let Takahiko go, gave us a minute's leeway... Saika? He worked like a dog. At the plant. Where the primary cooling system is. So basically, he crawled around cleaning a contaminated floor. Not with these. Can't take anything contaminated out. It's dangerous, but it pays well, right? Chicken feed. It's the only work around here. For Saika and me. We gotta risk our lives everyday just to make a living. I wonder what drove Saika to work like a dog. Sorry. I'm busy, so come back tomorrow. We've only got two hours! Come to think of it... One time he got drunk and said some weird stuff. "The plant keeps us alive, but people don't want it." That's over my head! Me too! He said he knew stuff 'cause he was in the SDF. HQ's looking for a Saika among ex-SDF members. I bet it's an alias. You're getting smarter. Cut your damn hair! Let's roll! That's it. That's the camera. There must be an infrared camera next to it. They use its birds-eye view to adjust Big B's position. So whatever the weather, it stays over the plant. If the reactor walked, Big B would tag along. Yuhara? Yamashita? One moment. Ex-SDF member Saika? Yes. Was there an Isao Saika on Big B's development team? The development team was Naruyama, Higuchi... Shibata. And Satake. That's all I know. OK, OK. Is there any one of them you haven't seen today? Just Satake, I think. He left suddenly three years ago. Saika's really the hijacker? For now, he's the only one who fits the profile. It seems Saika's paid 10 months rent in advance. He's our guy alright. Murobushi and Sekine, correct? From here on, follow our lead. Orders from the top. So you've been looking for Saika too. No time to talk now. Hey! Seems he's quite the VIP. Mr. Saika? Delivery for you. Mr. Saika? Saika! Satake! The hijacker's dead?! But some controller's been found. It's being flown here. A controller? It might control Big B. There's more. His accomplice might work for your company. We're analyzing handwriting. What have they done? Altered the hijacker's name in the visitor log. They might know how to control Big B. Over to you. It's... ...impossible. Let's do this. Yuhara? We've only an hour and a half! Where do we even begin? I'm doing it! I arrived in Frankfurt last night. Don't worry. I'll be fine on my own. You will be too. Please...make it through this You will be too. Please...make it through this To delete this message, press 3. To play it again, press 1. To save, press 2. August 1st I'm hungry. That reminds me. About that visitor log... I've done it. I changed your name to "Haraguchi." Thanks. It's a big help. Top secret research stuff. You're lying. I guess lying's OK, if you have a good reason. Anyway, what about Germany? You won't go with me? I've got a business trip. I absolutely have to leave on the night of the 8th. You leave as planned on the night of the 7th, and wait for me there. Why did you choose me? A woman like me. I'm no fun to be around. Why say that? We... ...look at things the same. This journey... ...will change our lives. To save the message... Message deleted. It's hot. Yuhara? It won't help us? It lets us do three things. Activate the engine, adjust rotor angle, and switch to autopilot. If so, we can switch it back to manual, and take control! No. If we switch it back to manual, someone needs to pilot it. The hijacker will have reconnected the controls to another device. So you can't switch autopilot off with that? But if his demands were met, how would he control the heli? He knew his demands would never be met! What then?! There's nothing we can do?! It'll fall in 50 minutes! Chief! Everyone. Evacuate now. Haven't given up? Have you given up? I'll call you back. Yuhara! A model device was found at Saika's. They're faxing us a photo now. Staff are now leaving the plant, headed for a shelter. This person. The analysis is done! Junko Akamine, 32. General Affairs Section. She was due to go on leave, but canceled it to work. Junko Akamine! Where is she? Huh? She's gone. Junko Akamine. Hair long. Height 160cm. Thin. Distribute photos at exits. Don't let her escape! Junko Akamine? Wrong person. Sighted! First floor north exit! Akamine! Stop! Ms. Akamine! You're all busy people, so I'll get to the point. In February last year, my son contracted acute myeloid leukemia, at the tender age of 29, and died. My Yoshiyuki, he joined Daito Plant, and was involved in the maintenance and inspection of nuclear plants around the country. I believe they cut corners on inspection times and budgets, and turned a blind eye to their employees' health risks. In fact, one of Yoshiyuki's... What's up, nuke lover? Relax, I'm not taking your life. "Koichi Mishima, Nishiki Heavy Industries" I like your style. You've been tailing me? I wanted somebody from your company, but I didn't expect you. You nuke lovers would forget a floor-crawler like me. I deal in technology! Not nuclear power! You're the first and last to enter. My god. What the hell are you... I'm repossessing my toy. What on earth for? For crashing into an operational nuke plant. Revenge for being used up and thrown away? What a cliche. The hell it is! People don't want to face the truth. Everybody eats and shits! But shit gets flushed! I'm gonna throw it in the public's faces. The shit you made. If you mean that, I know the perfect target. I need you on the ground. A little reprogramming, and we can do it from anywhere. Because of that kid? It's God's wrath. No. I think of it more as God's blessing. What do I do? Cops are everywhere. Lay low, as planned. Well, after all, they did fire me for planning a coup d'etat. They'll pin it on me soon. While they're hunting you, I'll be free. Bees... Bees send out decoys to protect their nest. Right? I looked it up. Decoy drones draw enemies into the nest, and die with them. If you were afraid to die, we'd never have met. I'll be waiting for you. In hell. Why have you got that? Got what? That. Return it. It's my work. It's our blood! My mistake. I'll return it later. 0:40 remaining Ms. Junko Akamine. You did this? Change the name? Look. This is your handwriting. It's been altered twice. In the last six months. Is that such a serious offense? No it ain't. Even so, if somebody made you do it to steal info on that, it's damn serious. You were asked to do it by this guy, right? If it don't stay up for another 40 minutes, all those people'll die. Excuse me, it seems there is Shinyo's staff inside. What did he tell you? Answer me! I don't know this man! Ms. Akamine. The man who told you what to do is still here, isn't he? Stop! Some kind of pressure activates this. Mishima. What's it for? I know you left that box in front of me on purpose. Until that bee stings, I'll keep fighting. We've fought enough! But our government doesn't care about your child. They stopped the plants. But not their real control consoles. Only their training simulators. SCRAM confirmed. All control rods inserted. That footage was faked! But Nakatsuka and... You really think experts like them wouldn't notice? Our government will never shut down the plants. If they stopped them all for even one day, it'd ruin their nuclear policy. So they deceived me... No. They deceived us all. Electricity trumps human life. That's their creed. The public doesn't know that. You know why? They don't want to know the truth. Even if an outrage is committed, they won't open their eyes! Yuhara. Your son's life was used to ensure nuclear power's future! I'm grateful. Grateful? Not to the government. To those who risked their lives for Takahiko. Then why didn't anyone save Tomohiro?! Don't! Come down! Come down! Come down! Tomohiro! Why?! Tomohiro! Tomohiro! No one... ...saved Tomohiro. Nor did I. "Contaminated" "No nuke power" "Chernobyl" "Get lost, nuke lover" They said nothing. Did nothing. They stared, wearing identical masks. No one really tried to save Tomohiro's life. They held on to their masks. I wanted... ...to see beneath them. There was no bullying. Tell me, please! You must've seen. They got on fine. What about this? One boy's parents are anti-nuclear activists. He led this project on environmental conservation. And it inevitably became anti-nuclear power. Then I realized. Even if I tore off one mask, people would just put on another mask and stare indifferently. If so, I knew I had to hurl at least one stone at those mask-wearing masses. Those silent masses... ...of Japanese... who killed Tomohiro! That man... He wants to die. If he didn't, he never would have come here! Ms. Akamine. You're the only person who can save this country. This country doesn't care if that heli falls into the plant. Mishima! This isn't you! When Tomohiro died, I died too. Mishima! Here we go. Stop! Stop! Stop, Mishima! Stop! That man... Will he be charged with murder? 0:15 remaining Frontline Shelter Yuhara! Yuhara! Junko Akamine is Mishima's lover. Know her? Excuse me. Mishima! 15 minutes left. The plant's still manned! Tell me how to save them! There's no way to do that. You were right. I knew my demands wouldn't be met. Didn't you spare Takahiko because you were a father?! You wanted to spare him! You don't get it, Yuhara. A child on board gave them an excuse. Your son was in the way. Tell me! How can I pilot that heli?! Tell me! Back off! Back off! Yuhara, this isn't you. You don't know me! You're an engineer. You can make a gun, but you won't shoot it. For the people I love... ...I will! I'm glad. Now you and I...are the same. Daddy! Takahiko! He needs to tell you. The cockpit's wired. Wired? A red wire, from here to here. Behind the panel. This cable must be connecting the infrared camera to the auto flight control. That means, if the sea temperature changes, a signal is sent to crash the heli! If so, we're powerless! No. When the signal stops the engine, it switches to manual! I don't get it. The engine stops, yeah? It stops, but not its electrical system. We'll pilot it with that! Got it! Auto-rotation! Even so, we could pilot Big B up close for only a few seconds. It's enough. To nudge it away from the plant! It'll soon fall out of range! It will if we're level, but not if we hover below. Set. Here. Nishioka? My men will take you to the reactor container. Press the button and run. Understood. Nishioka, I'll stay here. Chief... Yuhara. You want to die? No, Yamashita. I want to live. If we wait, we have no chance. This will give us a chance. Hovering below will enhance it. It's a leap of faith. Every leap takes us closer, to the stars. We engineers know that! Let's work together... on the next Big B! A new helicopter, the CH-50J. Big B will run out of fuel and crash in five minutes time. An evacuation order... Akamine lived with her parents, but they died in January. Both of them? On a trip to Kobe, in the earthquake... Ms. Akamine. Something's bugging me. Why did you cancel your holiday? You didn't know about his plan, did you? I found out yesterday. He said I couldn't fly in my condition. Shinyo's reactor will SCRAM at 4pm, in an attempt to divert Big B. Call it off now, idiot! You told me to shut down. Without anybody noticing, I said! The public will think all of Japan's reactors have shut down. In that sense, the hijacker wins. Even so, if we can save this by losing, I'm happy to lose. To save this plant. To save or abandon it isn't for you to decide! We need to consult the P.M.'s office first! Just call if off, idiot! We... ...saw nothing. I'm safe here. It's not wishful thinking. For me, believing in this plant means believing in its staff. "Congratulations! First Critical State" We're 200 meters below. If this doesn't work, Big B comes down on top of us! You want us this close? We have to get close to divert Big B! Alright. Do it! Can I take this off? It's dangerous! I need to get a stronger signal. Please! Yamashita! The device is here! This is... Begin countdown. SCRAM. SCRAM! SCRAM! SCRAM done! SCRAM done! Run! Quick. Hurry! Mr. Yuhara! Connect! OK! It can't be... Yuhara. Join the swarm. Avert! You went this far to crash it? You're insane! One day, you'll learn... ...who's truly insane. As of now, Big B will have fallen on Shinyo, but I know that its reactor will be safe. Big B was carrying only 10 sticks of dynamite. The plant's safety system will have cooled down the reactor. I chose Shinyo because other nuclear plants would leak radiation if a heli hit them. If by some error, a heli fell not into a reactor, but into a spent nuclear fuel pool, less sturdy than a reactor building... If a heli hit it, what damage would 10 sticks of dynamite have done? However, Shinyo has just begun operating, and has little spent fuel. Plus, the pool is underground. You think fast-breeder reactors are dangerous, but before our plan, they were judged to be safe. Big B has been successfully diverted into the sea. The crash caused no casualties. Nuclear reactors may smile at humanity, or bare their fangs. To expect only the former is hubris. Daddy, are you sick? The silent masses should never be allowed to forget this. We must remind them and force them to choose. A child learns the danger of bees when stung. Imagination without pain is merely a sweet dream. Imagine this. Next time it could be more than 10 sticks of dynamite. OK, check the kitchen. "Transmission failed" Tomohiro? Daddy! March 13th, 2011 Job is finished, going back now. Your turn. Got it. Over to you. Yes. Dad? I wanted to help, and so did my company. It'll help. We need all we can get. Yesterday... ...Mishima died in prison. Takahiko. Is this country worth dying for? "It's worth it here." Pilot Yuhara!
