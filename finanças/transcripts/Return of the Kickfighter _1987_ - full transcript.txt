[MUSIC PLAYING] [FOOTSTEPS] [SPEAKING VIETNAMESE] I knew we'd get those mother fuckers. Yeah, but those suckers never figured we'd trail them back to their mother's womb. Yeah, I bet you never seen no Marines this far behind enemy lies before, have you, honey? [GASPS] Hey, hey, we got a wildcat here. [SPEAKING VIETNAMESE] Leave her alone. She's not from Cong village. I don't give a damn where she's from. A gook's a gook. Tie her up. All right, those VC snipers are held up in that village over there, and we're gonna knock them out. Collins, Turner, take your fire teams into flanking action. Rest of you, follow me!

[MACHINE GUN FIRE] [SHEEP BLEATING] Come on! Move it! [MACHINE GUN FIRE] SOLDIER: Come on, move it! Shit! Come on! SOLDIER: Come on, move it! SOLDIER: Move! SOLDIER: Move it! [MACHINE GUN FIRE] Whole damn village is crawling with VC. Call in the air strike. Herd Dog to Bulldog, over. There's no need for an air strike. Herd Dog to Bulldog, over. Just what the fuck do you know? Innocent people, children, no air strike, please! [HELICOPTER HUMMING] SOLDIER (ON RADIO): Herd Dog to Bulldog, over. Bulldog, read you loud and clear. SOLDIER (ON RADIO): We've got to get rid of some pesky Charlies across the river. Be happy to oblige you, captain. Lay in a coordinates then hug the ground. [HELICOPTER HUMMING] They are only bandits, three [INAUDIBLE]. Get this clown off my case! Blue, 1.3. Right, 1.6. Come on. Hey, what the hell's he doing? Killing himself. He's just gonna be a roasted [INAUDIBLE]. [MACHINE GUN FIRE] SOLDIER (ON RADIO): [INAUDIBLE]. I'm joining that [INAUDIBLE]. Fuck the air strike. I smell blood! [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [SCREAMING] Take a couple of men, run out those women and kids and move them to a safe place. OK, Marines. Let's do it. High kill ratio, no prisoners. Let's bring in that body count. I want corpses not casualties! Let's show those heathens the wrath of the Lord! [SCREAMING] [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [SCREAMING] Come on, move it out there, Johnny. Pull it out! Out there, guys. Move it out!

That's up to the authorities, Mickey Mouse. We're Marines, not goldsmiths. [LAUGHS] [SOLDIERS LAUGH] [MUSIC PLAYING] Man, I'll tell you, this job sucks. I can think of a million places I'd rather be than this fucking shit-hole, teaching you airheads how to fly. Well, that's what I like about you, your disposition. Why you fuck up. Hey! [GROANING] That's a bomb! [EXPLOSION] [ALARM SOUNDING] Pollack, get in here. Sir. How many times do I got to tell you to shut that goddamn door behind you? Yes, sir. Have you seen this? Yes, sir. The investigation report on Hugit's death. Jim Hugit? He's number nine, and they blew the chopper with him. And that's how I know they're after us. Who the fuck is he? Some half-assed yellow skinned ghost. Tan Mai. Maybe, but I'm not gonna let him get to me. We're gonna get to him first. How in hell we gonna do that? We don't even know where he is? By looking under every damn rock. And I know just the man for the job. Uh, yes, give me Major Cooper. Not that know-it-all kangaroo from down under? Maybe, but he's the best. He has a master's in four Eastern languages. He was head of the scout sniper team in Cambodia, youngest decorated vet, fucking killing machine. Besides, he was only raised in Australia. He's American, all-American. Yeah, but he sports a beard. He's got long hair. What's the Corps coming to? He's under government from the Pentagon, what can I say? But we can't tell him about the gold. Use your head, Pollack. He doesn't have to know everything. Using him makes me look good with the top brass. And it keeps General Walker off my ass. [GRUNT] [GROAN] [GRUNT] [GRUNT] [GROAN] Oh, man. I didn't see what hit me. Was it the 10 ton truck or wrecking ball? Grease lightening, man. You OK? Hey, man, you'll have your day. Oh yeah? What you gonna do? Call in the queen's cobra. One queen cobra is all it takes. Why don't you work out in my [INAUDIBLE] next week, huh? Good idea. See you next week, Anan. Hi, Nancy. Hi. Oh, Colonel Ryan would like to see you, sir. Oh yeah? Yes, sir. Uhh. Tell the old man I'll be right there with him. Oh, oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me, sir. COLONEL RYAN: There were savage and brutal killings. I don't want to jump to any hasty conclusions, but the victims belonged to my old unit in Nam, recon team Charlie and the Fifth Special Forces Group airborne. If they are perpetrated by the same people, and if there is a plot to snuff out my boys, I don't care about why's or whereas. I want to know who, and you're gonna find out. Begging the colonel's pardon, I haven't the slightest idea what we're talking about. Major Pollack with brief you. Anything for the Corps. COLONEL RYAN: Oh, by the way, major, you'll have to trust me on this one. I can't cover you with a mission order for this operation. So, uh, you're on your own. If you get into any trouble, any hassles, I won't pry you out. Why am I doing it then? Hey, don't get me wrong. This is on the up and up, nothing illegal. Fact is, it's high priority official. But we just don't know who we're up against, but we don't want to play into the wrong hands, get my drift? Yeah. Nail the sucker! Name Hugit, James L. Cause of death, assaulted by Vietnamese terrorists, broken neck, cracked ribs, 20th of October. Took three airman and a Huey with him, right? That's him. You'll find a more detailed account of these men in their case files. The colonel feels we can establish certain facts. Sure. The killer or killers are Oriental. Two, the area of attack is confined to Southeast Asia. Three, they don't use guns. Bare heads, brute force, and crude weapons seem to be the preference. There's more to this than meets the eye. And fourth? They all belong to recon team Charlie. That's right. I want a complete list of all the guys on the team, their present status, and whereabouts. Best they're warned about these attacks. Of course. You guys weren't involved in anything funny in Nam, were you? Are you kidding? They were all Grade A Marines. Why would anyone want to terminate a whole recon team? There are a lot of fruit cakes out there, major. Yeah, maybe. Besides, the colonel doesn't want to know why. Yeah, he just want to know who. Well, maybe that's why I want to know why. GENERAL: Major Cooper. Yes, sir, general. Understand that Colonel Ryan has you working on a rather unusual case. Yes, sir. I think you should know that the Corps is not particularly happy with Colonel Ryan's latest fitness report. I'd appreciate you keeping me informed on your investigation. Sure, sir. Hey, Jenkins? Hey, Coop. What brings you to the city of the dead? You never know. Dead men do tell tales. What can I do for ya? There's a few things I want to know about your old unit. What old unit? Recon team Charlie. Never heard of it. Hey, don't jerk me, pal. Your name's on the roster, and your mug's all over the files. I buried that part of my life. Well, dig it up. Look, have a heart, Coop. There's just some things a man wants to forget. Like what? I can't. Coop, please don't do this. I got myself reclassified just so I wouldn't have to live through moments like this. It's a matter of life and death, Jen-- Ah leave me alone, will ya? Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout. I just-- I can't hack it. Please, leave me alone. OK. Just one thing then I'll go. I want you to identify a guy here, that's all. Just tell me who he is, all right? Keeps turning up in the file photos, but there's no mention of him in the roster or field reports. Must be ARVN. Quan Nhien. He might have some answers. Where can I find him? Hong Kong. He's Vietnamese. We used him in Nam as a scout and interpreter. He escaped from Vietnam some time in '79 with some boat people. He lives in a colony now, Aberdeen. [METAL CLINKING] You Quan Nhien? Brad Cooper. Colonel Ryan asked me to see you. We're busy. No time. Just need a couple of minutes. You better go now. Didn't come here to make trouble, buddy. You Americans need to leave me alone. You bring death. You bring war. And then you left. That was a long time ago, Quan. Nothing ever change. What if I told you someone was trying to kill all your Nam buddies? I have no Nam buddies. Recon team Charlie, Fifth Special Forces, assault group. You were scout and interpreter for them. A mistake I must not repeat. Please go away. I just want you to know there's some maniac out there trying to wipe your names off the roster. If you change your mind, feel free to call me. [CHEERING] [ROOTERS CLUCKING] [CHEERING] [GRUNTING] [PANTING] Come on you, bitch. Do something! [PANTING] Enjoy the pain. [SCREAMS] [CRIES] Jesus Christ. Pollack, get your ass over here as soon as possible and bring Cooper with you. Do you realize the risk you're taking by being here? I've taken worse. [PHONE RINGING] No, don't. Why? Hiding something? Very funny. Yeah? POLLACK (ON PHONE): Major, Colonel Ryan wants to see us in his office immediately. Ah, shit. yeah, all right. Be there in a second. How the hell did he know you were here? Well, what fun is it if nobody knows? Men. You love it. Better have a damn good reason of getting me out of a warm bed, Pollack. It's the old man. What does he want? I don't. But he sure sounded upset about something. [KNOCKING] Come on. It's animal. The handiwork of the devil. More like an avenging angel. What the fuck do you mean, Cooper? If you got something to say, spit it out! Message is clear. You know damn good and well I don't speak Vietnamese. That's what you're here for. It says, "Remember Tan Mai." We're next, colonel. Shut up, Pollack. He's right. Cong's in your backyard, and he's given a warning. You make it sound like he's got every goddamn right the world to do it. Tan Mai. COLONEL RYAN: What are you getting at, Cooper? I don't know yet, but I aim to find out. You're off the case, Cooper. I don't want your filthy nose sniffling into my business. You hear me? Stay away from here, you half-assed piece of shit. Colonel, you think-- There's no time for thinking, asshole. This is a time for action. Colonel, you think this has to do with the Tan Mai gold? I told you, don't think. Nobody knows about that except our team. That wasn't stealing. If you think it was, why don't you be a good little boy and give yours back to Cong? Just a thought. The fucking gook wants war, we'll give him war! [MUSIC PLAYING] You want some fun?/ one girl, two girls? No thanks. Wow. 20 bucks. That's the 20 you owe me! You bitch. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hi. Yeah, baby, way up high. Lord of the sky. I need your help, Jenkins. Would you come down a little while just for that? Not tonight, sweetheart. Can't you see I'm real busy? [MUSIC PLAYING] Look, I gotta know what really happened in Tan Mai. Tan Mai? How did you know about Tan Mai? You've got the wrong guy. I had no part in that. I swear on my mother's grave. I had nothing to do with that. I swear to god, man. Oh. Stay away from me! I thought the colonel told you to keep your nose clean, candy ass. Don't act tough, sucker. You're gonna get a boot up your ass, man. You and who else? [SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] Tell the colonel I don't want any more trouble. Neither do we. Then don't look in my direction. [ZIPPING SOUND] Fool! That's right. Prove how stupid you've already become. I do not deserve this treatment. Your greed has made you blind to everything else. Your thirst for vengeance has made you careless. And now you're preying on blood and brought an intruder into our sanctuary. No one knows of this place! This old man followed you here. Sensei. I did not arrange your release from that miserable Communist re-education camp for you to go after other thieves like yourself. Forget this, this gold. That was years ago. It was never yours. You stole it. Now it's theirs. You fool! These empty dreams of yours, this obsession to become the supreme master, it's preposterous. You are here to train my people, nothing else. Bring this private vendetta to an end now. I will not have you jeopardize my operations! We have much more at stake here than a few gold bars. Take him away. Kill him. [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [GRUNT] Where is the old man? He got away. --[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I have got to silence the old goat! Sensei! [GRUNTING] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Oh. Sensei, Sensei! Sensei. Your brother, he-- he has become all evil over the years. He now [INAUDIBLE] the forbidden ark of [INAUDIBLE]. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Now he's after the Americans. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Must be stopped. He must be destroyed. It is done, Sensei. Sleep will come more easily. He asked me to give you this. This terrorist he speaks of. I know where they are. It is heavily guarded as the assassins will tell you. No one can get in without being seen. I must try. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Bless you. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah? OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Major Cooper, you have a call for Mr. Quan Nhien, sir. Put him threw. I'll take the charges. There are no charges, sir. It's a local call. Go ahead. QUAN NHIEN (ON PHONE): Hello? Quan Nhien, this is Brad Cooper. QUAN NHIEN (ON PHONE): I did not wish to make this call, but I need your help. And you need mine. We should meet. [KNOCKING] Come in. Coffee? No, thank you. Actually, I never figured on ever bumping into you again. The sensei, he [INAUDIBLE] to become one. Sensei, that's Japanese for teacher. He's more than that. But you will not understand. Try me. He's life, nobility, the code. That is my path. He also know identity of the phantom you chased. That is your path. They both lead to a terrorist camp. Terrorist camp? Up on the Kohinoor Mountains, hidden from view. The man you seek, trains terrorists in the art of ninjitsu. How do you know the man I'm after? Why doesn't Ryan do this himself? You were not in Tan Mai. Why you? What is this Tan mai story? I don't want to talk about that. If you cannot help me, I will go. The old man must've meant a great deal to you. He taught me everything I know. Said he was a 36th direct descendant of the Iga ninja and you fished him out of Vietnamese waters. QUAN NHIEN: We pulled him out of the sea, my brother and I. We were only kids. As he grew stronger, he taught us the martial arts and the sacred code. Then he was gone as mysteriously as he had appeared. The war came. My brother and I parted. He joined the Cong. He is the man you seek. He's the brother I must kill. This was the wish of my sensei. [GRUNTING] [CHANTING] All right. You watch. You, here. You two, here. [GRUNTING] All right, group closer. [GRUNTING] As you can see, we're totally isolated here. No one knows this stronghold exists. On this terra, we turn out the finest crop of assassins, terrorists, saboteurs the world over. Of course, we're not just talking about equipment here. We're talking about men, primarily men. [MACHINE GUN FIRE] Over here we have the comprehensive obstacle course that's always part of the training. How long will it take to get these men ready? We are always ready. [MACHINE GUN FIRE] That's the man you're after. No, wait. Move, move! Faster! This looks like live ammo. You guessed right. [EXPLOSIONS] [MACHINE GUN FIRE] The helpless are useless. Kill him. No! That's an order. And if you want to join him-- No! [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [SCREAMS] Anan! How are you doing? Not bad. Quan Nhien. Oh, hello. Listen, I need a favor that could just very well make you-- Oh, save the bull, Coop. What trouble are you in this time? You know of a training camp around the base of any kind up in the Kohinoor Mountains? Coop, why don't you Americans understand that "Rambo" was only a movie. Ha. A training camp at the Kohinoor Mountain? Who the hell is trying to fool you? Meet me at the turn-off in one hour with some of your boys. Maybe it'll change your mind. Why are you using Thai Army? You don't have own people? You know, it's illegal in these territory for the US Army to become involved in any sort of military operations. Who've you got on detail watching these choppers? Johnson and Williams. It's not a very good job. Get it straightened out. Yes, sir. You're right there. You're slacking off a lot lately. You wait a minute. Collins, isn't that Cooper? You're right, sir. Who in hell is that guy with him? I don't believe it. It's Mickey Mouse, our old [INAUDIBLE]. I want those two shadowed, 24 hours a day. Yes, sir. I'm looking forward to some good hunting, Coop. Place is damn near impregnable. With the proper diversionary tactics, maybe the two of us can sneak in. We'll be happy to put up diversions, but don't be surprised if they'll go all the way to the top. That may be easier said than done, even for Queen's Cobras. We'll soon find out. Good luck! See you there, Coop. Cover your ass! Quan and I will make our way across the cable. You and your boys must wait for my signal. How much time shall we give you? I'd say 15 minutes. We've got to avoid being seen or heard till we make our way across. As I said before, this is a viper's nest. Oh yeah? But the cobras is the king of snakes. Yeah, well, maybe this time we'll find out. All right, men, bring in the other stuff. We'll wait here. [MUSIC PLAYING] We'll split up. I'll meet you near the entrance of the cable cross. OK. [GROAN] [GROAN] [MACHINE GUN FIRE] Mike, Samsa, six men come with me. The rest of you, stay behind. [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [GROANING] You're always getting into trouble, Coop. This trouble's just starting. [GRUNT] [GROAN] -No! You will make a good moving target in a [INAUDIBLE]. Well, that is [INAUDIBLE]. Tie him up! You take some of the men and go this way. It's the only alternative path that leads to the top. The rest will come with me. I'll go around this side toward the cable crossing. We'll meet at the top, but you'll need a head start. Yeah. That's easier said than done. Two miles is the Kohinoor Mountain. The terrorists come. Repeat-- terrorists come. Captain Anan, Royal Thai Army, Queen's Cobras division. Requesting US military assistance. COLONEL RYAN (OVER RADIO): Charlie 1, this is Colonel Ryan. Repeat your location. Where the fuck are you? Repeat your location. You heard him, Ryan. Kohinoor Mountains, terrorist camp, and in that camp is the man you're after, the Cong who survived your fucking Tan Mai mission. Terrorist camp? Son of a gun. I get to see some action after all. Major, may I be relived sir? Where the hell are you going, Marine? I've got to get these to General Walker, sir. He asked me to keep him up to date on these operations. [PHONE RINGING] Hot dog, a terrorist camp! Goddamn Cong played right into my hands, sitting on a powder keg just waiting for me to blown him to smithereens. Yeah. We can't do anything without top level clearance. How we gonna get him? Simple, just light a few fuses, sit around, and wait for the fireworks. I'll be in my office. Keep me posted. You took my gold. Huh? What the hell? [GRUNTING] Thank you for minding the store, major. General Walker is trying to get a mission ordered to the Pentagon. We're gonna level that terrorist camp to the ground. But the general's requested that you stay here to monitor any further developments, sir. Interesting. Yes, sir. Mighty interesting. [INAUDIBLE]. Sir. I just got the green light. All channels clear to assist a high army in a raid on a terrorist camp in Kohinoor. Yes, sir. I want this chopper and a squad combat ready on the double. I'm going to talk to Ryan, work out a game plan before we pull out. Where is he, anyway? Should be in office, sir. Carry on, sir. Ryan. Sir, look at this. Ski mask, sir? That's right, and Captain Anan's radio message said that all those terrorist sons of bitches where ski masks. Where'd you find it, sir? In Ryan's office. You mean one of them's been here? That's right, and they've killed Ryan. Now that is an outright challenge to the United States Marines, son. Nobody, I repeat, nobody gets away with that. Are your men ready? Yes, sir. Well, saddle up. We've got a battle to win. [HELICOPTER HUMMING] [GRUNT] [GROAN] [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [ZIPPING SOUND] [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [ZIPPING SOUND] [MACHINE GUN FIRE] Congratulations, men. You've reached the last lesson of training. All the hardships that we put you through, it's been worth it. As you now know, your target is a nuclear power plant. Unfortunately, we don't have a nuclear plant we can practice on. You'll find that our abandoned cement factory is a good training down for all industrial targets. [EXPLOSION] Come! Colonel! [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [SCREAMING] [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [GROAN] Cover! [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [GROANING] [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [GRUNTING] [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [SCREAMING] [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [GRUNTING] [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [GROAN] [HELICOPTER HUMMING] [MACHINE GUN FIRE] Moudares. It's true. Collins, take care of him. OK. The relief chopper's on the way. Anan. It's over. He's dead. [HELICOPTER HUMMING] So when do I hear this Tan Mai story? I can tell you that story over cup of Marines' coffee. We've got General Walker on the radio, and he wants to talk to you, major. COOPER: That's OK, captain. I'll see the general back at the base. SOLDIER: We got our orders. Less blow that rat's nest up! [EXPLOSION] OK, you son of a bitch, I'll talk. You ain't got a lot of time. All the killing at the bloodshed was in vein. It's the gold. We took-- it was never reported. But-- but it's all still there. I can take you to it. We never spent it. We were too afraid. It wasn't my idea. It was Ryan's! Please. Ah, god. [BOARDS CREAKING] Shit. [PANTS] [INAUDIBLE] Marine coffee? Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING]
