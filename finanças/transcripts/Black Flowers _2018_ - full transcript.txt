-=Sync&Corrected by Misiek666=- Oh, my God. - They went this way. - -I'm on it. I can smell their fear. This way. They're right behind us. Come on. Weapons ready. Weapons ready! Honey, over here. - Prepare to fire! What are you doing? Get down. - I'm so sorry. - -It's OK. It's OK. I'll live. Here. - Get down. - -Here! Get down. Shh. Fan out! I can smell you. Let's go. We lost 'em. I can't believe they were hiding right under my nose. Don't worry, we'll get 'em in the end. Shoo. Psst. Scat. Sam? Are you OK? I'm fine. Just don't fuss. Hey. Don't be ridiculous, Sam. We can wait here a while. No. We can't afford to stay here any longer. No, Dad, listen to Mom. You're hurt. What, this chicken scratch? Yeah? Watch me. This is how good I am. You're a beast. - Here, give me the bag. - Katie? Katie, you're in charge now. Which basically means nothing's changed. Let's go. People mean danger. No good will come of 'em. We gotta head deeper into the forest. Nature will provide. You'll see. What the hell was that? A mutant? It's an elk. Over there. Be careful. - You shot me. - Are you OK? - Am I OK? What the fuck? - I didn't mean to shoot you. I don't really care! - Does it hurt? - Does it hurt? What the fuck? Want me to take a look at it? It's not so bad. It's just a flesh wound. - What are you doing here? - Practicing my golf swing. Are you stupid? Buddy, I suggest you answer the lady. Just passing through and... - With that bunch of scavengers? - No, no, I'm on my own. Hunting that goddamn elk. A man's gotta eat. All the other animals have been acting strange, like they're... mad or something. It's all that radiation crap. Where you passing through to? What business is it of yours? We're looking for a safe place to live. Our last place just got raided. We lost all our stuff. My husband needs medical attention. He got shot. I was heading north-east to an old nuclear bunker that was built for an end-of-times apocalypse church cult. Named Salvation. It's safe, full of food, booze, medical supplies. And nobody knows about it. Booze? How come you're not there already? I was in California when the apocalypse happened. It's taken me months to walk here, staying out of sight, hunting, living off the land. Till you shot me. Hey, I feel bad about that, OK? Not as bad as I do. - Texas Guitar Massacre fan? - Saw them six times. Roadied with them on four tours. Did Europe, Brazil, even Russia. - Wow. - Oh, no. Not you, too? In my bag, there's a map. It's a pretty awful map. What do you expect? I'm not frickin' Google Maps. All right, all right. Sorry. You wanna come with me? Help me find it? Share the loot? - Get the medical supplies? - Yes! Sound like a plan? What do you think, honey? It's up to you. You got any bullets you can spare? Two rounds of .38. Ammo's scarcer than clean water. Or clean underwear. OK. We'll go with you to this Salvation bunker. - What's your name? - Joe. I'm Kate, this is Sam, and you've already met Suzi. Hi. Charmed. North-east. We're going north-east. - Cool. Can I try? - We head to the mountain and look for the blue bridge, then find Salvation. What do you call a deer with no eyes? - No Eye Deer. Come on, that was good. You guys are crazy. You're very funny, you know that? - Leave the joke telling to me. - -Come on. You're the leader. You got the gun, I got the jokes. That's good material. I'm sorry, but that's gold. It's comedy gold. I bought some shoes once from a drug dealer. I don't know what he laced them with, but I was trippin' all day. My ears hurt more than my feet right now. What is this place? Give me the binoculars. What do you think? Does it look empty? We need supplies. I'm good. Good luck. - Be careful. - -Joe, keep a look out. One... two... three. Four. It's all dead. Solar charger! Mom, look at this! It's got a USB. This is my stuff. We don't want any trouble. Just scavenging. You taste as sweet as you look, girlie? - Delicious. Nice. - Do not mess with my kid! You OK, Mom? It's OK, it's a different world now. We just... do what... needs to be done. - Let's go. - Jesus, Joe! - What? There was a man in there. He could have killed us. - I didn't see nothing. - "I didn't see nothing." You're supposed to be the lookout! I'm sorry. My arm kind of hurts. - Mom bashed his head in. Oh, you think that's funny? If you're gonna stay, you gotta do what I say. - It's my map. - It's like that, is it? Guys, calm down. I'm just saying, you need me. We'll see. We just almost got killed because of you. - Oh, you gonna shoot me? - Guys, guys! Mom. Joe. Calm down. We're a team, remember? Hey. Hey there. Don't worry, I'm still with you. - Better be. - I'm not done yet. How are you doing, darling? Except for the hole in my gut, I'm perfect. Which is why you married me, right? - Yes, it is. So, uh, what did you find? A-ha! - I got these. We're going to get you to a doctor, gonna get you to safety, then we're gonna go swimming, and it's gonna be just like old times. - That's perfect. - Yeah. I'm looking forward to it. Found this, Dad. Hey, look at that. Nicely done. Let's get that in the sun and get that puppy working, huh? Why bother? It's been two years. Well, they always tell you, in times of crisis, to listen in to emergency frequencies, but does anyone know how those work, or how police channels work... or anything? - No, I do not, Suzi. - Exactly. So I'm just gonna try calling 911. That is, if I ever get a signal. Are you all right, honey? Ah, don't worry about me. I'm OK till nightfall. What are those? Black flowers? It's nothing natural, that's for sure. Oh, shit. Bad radiation, we gotta go. Yeah, let's. Chem clouds! Gas masks! Let's go. How'd you guys survive for so long? Dad kept us hidden. Built a special place. - What happened? - -I messed up. Some scavengers followed me home after I went looking for some batteries. We got raided, Dad got shot. I got careless. Hey, don't blame yourself. Just gotta think of the future. Right. Why did the tomato blush? It saw the salad dressing. Oh, no, why did I laugh? No, don't make me laugh, it hurts. We'll camp here. Suzi, get a fire going. Joe, check the area. Who made you king? Queen, not king. And no one made me anything. - I was born in charge. Oh, my God. It works! The solar charger works. I've got one percent power. There won't be any signal, though. All the phone companies are long dead. Oh. There's... The satellites are still up. I mean, maybe some of them are solar powered. I can't believe all the electricity's just gone. Well, the nuclear power plants will be churning out some kind of energy. I mean, you can't just turn 'em off. - Right? - But you can blow 'em up. I've seen three nuclear plants on fire. They'll just burn for a thousand years, spreading their cancer. You're so negative. You're like a life force vampire. We got any food? I'm hungry. Ugh. What'd you get? Come on. Anchovies! Why has it always gotta be anchovies? That's all that's left. Nobody wants 'em. What month is it? I think it's October, but... I can't be sure. Huh. I never realized how much I relied on my cell phone to tell me what day it is. Don't worry yourself, Sam. Now I've just got this watch, and it just tells me what time it is. Which is really useful because, heaven knows, I wouldn't want to be late and miss that... job interview I got. It's a nice watch. Would you like it? Sure. Thank you. Joe. No, that's Dad's. - He's offering. - Yeah, but he's... Here. Should last you a good long time. - Probably the only thing here. - Joe! What? I'm just saying, it's a great watch. It'll last forever. If Sam wants it back, you give it back. Sure. Will you read to us, Suzi? It's just a poem. It's not very good. Oh... that's OK, honey. I think it's the last bit of culture that we have left. Honey, please. "My course is marked by stars." "When the cycle ends, will it start again?" "Have I the strength of my memoirs?" "Will my love for this land abstain?" "I travel across this dying plain." "Our destination, I know not where." "I guide my family by the hand, but death's shadow I see before me." "How long before I too sleep underground?" "Silent as a grave, without a sound." It's better this way. Thanks for the watch. Sam? Sam? Sam! Sam? Sam? - Sam. - Mom, what's going on? - What's wrong? - No, baby. Don't go yet. Dad? No, Dad! No! No! Goodbye, sweetie. I love you. I'll always miss you. He's in a better place now. He got to salvation first. - What now? - I don't know. I just... I don't know. I just... I'm just... trying to keep you alive. Dad would want us to keep going. Stay here. Keep your eyes open, Joe. "Flesh eaters"? Cannibals. - No. - Suzi. I'm not going that way. North-east. We have to go this way. Radiation that way, Radiation that way. That way, Salvation. Didn't you see the sign? It's not safe here. You should go. Mom? Yeah! Run away, cowards! You did not have to shoot him! Shoot first. Avoids questions later. Hello? Are you OK? - Honey? - Jesus. - Should we stop her? I think that's the cannibal. And we just killed the good guys. We need to shoot her. She's gone bad. Let's go. Lovely. What's that? It's a helmet. It's a hard hat. I know it's a hard hat. It won't protect you. It's not bulletproof. Maybe I just want a helmet. Why do you want a hard hat that isn't bulletproof? I just want it, OK? Might protect me from a tree branch or something. A tree branch? What the fuck's a tree branch going to do? Look, I just like it, OK? It's silver. Everyone can see you. It's not camouflage. I know. I don't get to wear much silver these days. And besides, everyone can hear you, and I don't go on about it. Take it off. What? No. Take. It. Off. No. - Take it... off. - No. What the hell?! Are you mental? You just wasted a bullet. What's going on? Joe's a control freak, that's what's going on. It's not bulletproof. I've just saved your life. You can't antagonize Joe like that. It makes things difficult. He just shot my helmet. It's a hard hat! - Don't be a bully, Mom. - -I'm a bully? You check it out. I'll cover you. Dang it. Jesus. Poor guy. Check him for ammo. You check him. You shot him. Dang it. What? You go. I checked the dead guy. Dang. What? Some poor kid. You think she's the dead dude's girlfriend? Or daughter. Wonder why he didn't bury her outside. Too scared. Too dangerous. Maybe he just loved her too much. We should stay here. Sun will set soon. We all stay in this room tonight. What's in there? Just a dead girl. Nothing bad. - Is life so cheap to you? - Hey! Look at this. Oh, my God. Clean teeth. You better take that. Oh, shampoo! Heave-ho, ho hi, take the stairs to touch the sky. Heave-ho, ho hi, take the stairs to touch the sky. Stop, stop, stop, my friends. Hi. Hi there. Hi. Hey there. Hi. Whatcha doing? We're taking this to the top of that hill. Huh. That's not a hill, that's a mountain. - Why? - So we can worship it. - Why? - Why? Why not? We haven't got anything better to do. And it's closer to God up on the top of the hill. Bonus. A stairway to Heaven. Remember, there is no ending to this world, only changes. What about getting food and water? Building a shelter? Oh, we'll do all of that once we have a place to worship. I think it's stuck. Oh, no. We never get a break. It's like the gods don't even give a shit. - You wanna help? - Sure. All right. One good shove should do it. Ready? One, two... and away! One, two... and away! One, two... and away! One, two... and away! Yay! You wanna come with us? We're actively seeking more disciples. Thanks, but I'm traveling with my daughter and her... her friend. Are we not all but part of one big family? You are my daughter, my sister. They're welcome to join us as well. Thank you, but... no. Do you have any spare food? Sorry, my child, we are without sustenance. But the gods will provide. Take this, with my blessings. It will bring you good luck. Thank you. Ah-ah-ah. What is that? The symbol of the stairs, of course. Ah-ah-ah. Oh. Of course. Good luck. I hope you get to the top of that hill. We will. Have faith. Ready? See you up there. Anybody order an Uber? How did you find this? The fuel gauge is bust, so I guess everyone just thought it was empty. I just turned the key and... vroom! This is gonna save us days. We gotta keep our eyes open. This is gonna draw attention to us. What speed we going at? I don't know. All the gauges are bust. Can you go a bit faster? We need to be at 60 or more. Why? When you hold your hand out the window at 60, it feels like you're holding a boob. You're a boob, Joe. We have to go around. That water's flowing down from a heavy nuke hit upstream. About 100 miles away. All those gamma particles are hot as hell. Nasty radiation. Well, that was two miles we didn't have to walk. We need to keep looking for the blue bridge. Salvation lies beyond. Suzi, why don't you try your phone? This is as close to one of your satellites as we're ever gonna get. Nothing. Not a single bar. It's like we've suffered complete technological death. The whole world has forgotten us. What do you think we'll find at the bunker? I hope there's beer. Meet my new friend, Mr. Peaches. Hello, Mr. Peaches. Good to meet you. - Bingo! I think we should stay here tonight. Oh, my God. Oh, we are definitely staying here tonight. Oh, my God, it is so good. Well, this is nice. You're secretly glad there was a nuclear war? Well, I never saw you before the invasion. You're glad the invasion happened, so you could see Suzi more often? I just meant that this moment is nice. Yeah. It's been a real career boon for me. So glad I studied computer engineering instead of fucking forestry. I need a pee. Gimme some peaches. Uh... Uh, here. Anchovies? Anchovies. Always anchovies. God. What have we become? My turn. Hey. That's mine. Don't be ridiculous. It belongs to all of us. I found it. It's mine. Jesus. Didn't they teach you sharing? Didn't they teach you not to be a bitch? Grow up. You'd be dead without us. You'd be dead without me. Suzi and I... we'd be better off on our own. Suzi and you? There's no Suzi and you. - There's only Suzi and me. Well... we'll see about that. - Coffee? - Yes, please. It's bitter, but good. Shall I read a poem? Yes. Really, Suzi? The last one killed your father. Suzi? I think you might be just a really horrible person. You women need to lighten up. Suzi? Suzi, I'm sorry. How could you say that? Sorry, that was a bad joke. It is my fault. Dad died because of me. He didn't die because of you. I feel guilty. Being happy like this with you. Well, you shouldn't be. We should... make the most of what we've got. Oh, my God. Suzi? Suzi! Suzi! Oh! Grimly. Oh, I never should have trusted him! If I see him again, he is dead! Just one piece of luck, universe, come on. Hey, hey, hey. Don't be afraid. Don't... Don't shoot, now. - Then don't creep up on people. - You're in my house, darling. This is where I live. If you've come over here for the tower, then you're out of luck, because this mast is deader than a doornail. Dang it. Looked like it was in good shape, too. Well, it did for us, too. That's what brought us over here. - Us? - My wife and I. I'm Jefferson and this is Millie. Kate. We were wondering if maybe you could do a trade. What do you want? It's the end of the road for us, and we've really, really lost heart. And we were wondering if maybe you could help us move on. Move on? Where to? I'm headed north-east. No. No. I mean move ON, move on. You want me to kill you? That's messed up. No way. Look, you can have all our stuff. Millie's got a really bad leg on top of the radiation sickness. We're just gonna starve. And what's the point? We've got nowhere to go. Our kids are dead, our grandchildren are dead. I watched them all eaten by the nuclear fire. It's got three bullets left. Why don't you do it? I can't shoot Millie. I can't shoot her. I just can't. Have you still got something to fight for? My daughter. She's out there somewhere. It's kill or be killed in this world. Make your first kill here. It's OK. We've had a good run of it. We used to have a house. Beach house up in Eureka. They were such fun times. Admittedly, the last couple of years have been a living nightmare, watching this hell on Earth take over our Eden, poisoned it with hate and greed and radiation and... Did them a favor. Did them a favor. God. Oh, hello, God. Sorry for not calling for 30 years. There's a few things I'd like to talk to you about. I've done some things that I think are your fault. I just want things to go back to the way they used to be. I just... I miss mail. I miss hot coffee and... I miss Sundays. I miss Sam. I won't complain about anything ever again if you'll just give me my daughter back. Gotta find the blue bridge. I've gotta find Suzi. Oh, Grimly. Those crazies. What are you? What am I? I'm lost, that's what I am. I'm lost. Lost? We're all lost. Are you real? No! She is real! Yes, yes, I'm real. Can I... Can I touch you? Shut up! I can't tell if what I'm seeing is real or not anymore. Oh. Jesus! Jesus! Jesus. - You are real, aren't you? - I think so. I'm pretty sure of it. I'm so glad. Can you help me? Please. I've lost my friends. I can't find them. I've lost mine. I've lost everything. I've lost my daughter. I'm lost. Don't lie down! You won't wake up. You'll die. These... These'll kill you. They'll send you to sleep. The darkness of the grave. Cheerful soul, aren't you? Oh... the darkness isn't bad. I welcome it. It's where my friends have gone, I think. I'm looking for the blue bridge. Do you know it? Oh, yes, I know it. What kind of a Ranger would I be if I didn't know where it was? All the maps we've ever read stay inside your head. Until you're dead. Keep the sun on this side of your face. - Just keep going, OK? - OK. Come with me. No, I can't. I've gotta find my friends. Did Sam send you? Thank you, Sam. Dang it, Grimly, these are the scum who raided our home. That's them. These are really bad people. We need to get away. - Last one. Enjoy it. - Cheers. Listen. Did you just hear that? Hey. Hey. Relax. We won't harm you. I'm looking for my daughter. She's wearing a red hat. It's got a white skull on it. Have you seen her? - No. - Are you alone? Has anyone seen her? - Did they follow you? - Who?! - Anyone! - No, no one. I haven't seen anyone for miles. Has anybody seen her? - Are you hiding here? - Hiding, waiting to die. - Just trying to survive. - We're just sheep! We gotta be wolves! Wolves survive. You know what always survives? The cockroach. We've got to be the cockroach. Come on. We're unarmed! Stop! Be the cockroach, go. Go! Got you. Think we got 'em all? My mask keeps fogging up. It's difficult to tell. - Did you spit in it? - Shut up! Idiot. Let's go. It's dinnertime. These scum, all they're good for is fertilizer. Come on. I'm starving. What was that?! Oh, what a bitch. I'm fine. I'm fine. I don't need anyone. I'm fine. I'm... fine. I'll be OK on my own. Son of a gun. Yes! - Music? I don't believe it. Grimly, do you hear that? Music means people. People mean danger. No good'll come of it. They may have seen Suzi. Welcome! Welcome, welcome. What are you doing? Haven't you heard? It's the end of the world. We're having a party! Have some. That's my girl. Follow me. Where you from? We'd spent about a year traveling. No direction, really. Then we stumbled on this place. Seemed as good as any other to wait for the end of the world. What's so special about this place? We reckon we have five years of supplies. Four tons of white rice. About 3,000 cans of beans. Regular and BBQ. Got enough booze to keep us drunk for the next few years. After that, who gives a shit? Oh, my God! The best place you're gonna find. Everybody's dying. Might as well die happy. I am DJ Apocalypso. That's not my real name. - I'm the leader here. - I'm Kate. That is my real name. - Got any painkillers? - Terri, pharma? Incoming. Most people here are high as a kite. - That'll fuck you up real good. - -You're welcome. We got plenty more where that came from. We got so many that we can't possibly take 'em all before we all die. Sounds like you've abandoned hope. No, no, no, no. We've abandoned hatred and greed. Drink? Enjoy. This is paradise. Come on. You seem sad. It's been an awful few days. I just wish we had found this place sooner. The world is full of sadness. But it is also full of beauty. That's why we must party, drink and laugh... while the rest of the world slowly dies. - It's not the world. - What? The world is just a huge lump of rock held together by bizarre physics, hurtling through cold, heartless space. She's right, bizarre physics. The world doesn't give a shit what's going on on top of it. We're like a small patch of psoriasis. Or like an STD that just will not go away. That is a heavy downer. - Want a drink? - Yeah. Two questions for you. Are you happy here? And do you think it's safe to stay here? Yes. "Yes." Yes to which? Whichever one makes you happy. - Can we stay? - Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Suzi! Oh, my God. Oh, uh... Hello. - I thought I'd never find you. - Welcome, friend. Oh. God. How are you? What happened to you? Where's Joe? Well, uh, when I woke up and found out he'd taken me away from you, we had a big fight and, um, I ran away. How'd you find me? I stole this. - You stole Joe's map? I just followed the compass and then heard the music and here we are. I was only ever a few hours behind you. - Drink? - Oh, my God, beer! It's cold! We have a solar-powered ice maker. Found it in an abandoned motel about 20 miles down the road. Spent a month dragging it here. You ladies can have the spare room over there. What can we say in the face of such luxury? - Thank you? - Thank you! What are you doing? Trying to get this thing to work. - Get in contact with... - With who? Whoever's out there. This phone is an obsession. A disease of the old world. Only by letting it go can you move on. Embrace this world, not the lost one. Yeah, not ready yet. Thanks. Want to dance? You do not want to see her dance. It's so embarrassing. It is not. Hold my beer. Give me some mud. Mud fight! Oh! I am so sorry. - You girls finished? - -Mm-hmm. - Feel better? - -Yeah. Can't sleep, huh? Just taking a moment. Nice place. Very peaceful. Drink? No. No, thank you. No. No more. Is that all you do? Drink and get stoned? Yeah. Not preparing for winter? No. So you're just going to sit here and wait for the world to end? Yeah. And you're welcome to join us. Dang it. I knew this was too good to be true. So, nothing special on the agenda for today? Every day is special, darling. Drinking, partying. What are those black flowers doing here? Oh, those. Damn, they have a... hell of a kick. You take one of these, you'll be knocked out for a week. Aah! - Mm. Want one? - No. I tell you, you can only do one, though. You do more than that, it will literally kill you. Found out that the hard way. Tommy was a good kid. Anyway, we call it over-podding. Are you goddamn crazy?! - What the fuck, man? What's the haps here? The haps is that you're all completely screwed. And if we stay, we're screwed. Ow. There are worse ways to go, darling. No, I'm not gonna give up on the world, so... Yeah, staying here is just a slow death. Have fun with your slow death. Not gonna do it. What a way to die. God, you're pathetic! Where are you gonna go, anyway, huh? We spent a year, a year, traveling this country. Know what we found out there? Radiation, tribes of killers, mutants, death. Here is safe, here is good. With all this booze and all those drugs. Why not party till the end? Because I need a better world for Suzi, OK? I'm not gonna let her drown it in a bottle, or some belladonnic haze like yours truly! It's gonna be OK. Just relax. Just have a bite. Goddamn it, I'll shoot your goddamn head off right now! Just chill out. Darling, just chill out. Chill out. Look, all right, I was just trying to help. You can go. - Yeah. - I won't stop you. OK! Look at what you're walking away from. - This is paradise, baby. Don't call me "baby"! Suzi? Get up. We gotta go. We gotta go. Get up. We need to go now! - What's going on? - Suzi, pack! Hurry up! Go! Do it! - What's going on? - Now! Can't I convince you to stay? Jesus, Mom! Look me up when you wisen up. Mom, what are you doing?! Shame. I really liked her. What a knockout. What's going on? Where are we gonna go? I don't know. Why did we have to go? - They had cold beer! - It's a bad place. Did DJ Apocalypso come on to you? That place is a death sentence. If we stayed there, we'd be dead within a year. Or worse. - What's the problem? - They've given up. Suzi, they've given up. They're dying. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Dang it. You promise me you will never give up, OK? - Wait, hold on, I have to stop. - No, no, no. - Not here. It's too exposed. - I have to pee. Hey! Look. Huh. It's the bunker. No one around. You stay here, OK? If I'm not back in ten... Welcome to Sanctuary. Should have taken better care of your gun. Oh, dang! This is lucky. - Fucking mansplainer. What kind of a goddamn welcome is that? That was rude. Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, fuck. Gonna get to you to a doctor. Gonna get you to safety. Mm. The good stuff. Gimme a break. Hey. Hello? Hey. You guys wanna be friends? Does it look like we want to be friends? - Got any food you can share? She shot Tina! We don't want to fight you. It's our bunker. We found it first. We don't want any trouble. No one else has to die. How many of you are there? Six. Twelve more on the way. You? - Shit, there's loads of them. - No, she's bluffing. Loads of us! A whole platoon on its way. - Shit, we even got a tank! - You idiot. - They won't believe that. - Sorry. I got carried away. Idiot. A big tank! Look, just let us go. We don't want any more trouble. Should we let 'em go? No, you idiot. They've got valuables, I can smell it. We'll let you go. - Promise not to shoot? - Promise. Drop your gun, then you can go. OK? OK. - Let her go. - Drop your gun. I'll kill her. Do not fuck with my kid. Aw, shit. You didn't have to do that. Darling? Darling? Saved you again, huh? - Oh, Joe. Huh. Look who it is. - -Like a bad penny. Hey, that's my pistol, you thieving pig. - You know him? - Yeah, he was running with us till he disappeared about a week ago. You're a lying scumbag. Joe? Catch, traitor. Shit! Grenade! - Run. - -Oh, my God! Run! Go, go, go, go. Dang it. Shut up. I don't think this is gonna be our new home. No, I think not. - You lied to us. - I did it for you. - Really? - Don't believe him. I saw you and I knew I had to be with you. - Oh, please. - Vomit! Shut up. That should do it. Once the rope burns through, you'll be free to go. I reckon 30 minutes. Aw, come on. Let me go? - I won't do nothing. - "I won't do nothing." What is it with people saying they "won't do nothing"? Let me break it down for you. We don't trust you, so no, we're not gonna let you go, simple as that. - Oh, but you trust this one? - No, absolutely not. He proved his loyalty. He came back for me. Yeah, of course he did. He'd much rather be in a bunker with a pretty girl than by himself. Come on, Suzi, we don't need this. Goodbye. You're really gonna let your daughter run off with a guy like that? No. What kind of mother are you? You know, in another lifetime, I think you and I could have been friends. Oh, come on! Don't leave me out here, guys! There's bears in the forest! And mutants! And worse! I'm gonna kill you! You're dead! Mommy? Thank you for your help back there. You're welcome. But if you try to take my daughter Suzi again, I'll kill you. Mom... Joe and I are gonna stand right over there, and you can keep an eye on things from over here. OK? It's fine. Goddamn it. Oh, Joe, you're so funny. He's really sorry. He didn't mean to hurt us. He's had time to think. Please. Oh, please. No, really. He was just afraid. He's dangerous. No, he's fine. He just made a mistake. You don't throw away a relationship because of one bad decision. A relationship? One bad decision? He drugged us. He tried to kill me. I didn't try to kill you. I was just scared you would stop me. Oh, well, that's OK, then. So, you gonna stay, or are you gonna try to take Suzi again? Whatever Suzi wants. Joe, we're better as a family. You, me... - Grimly. Stop. You're so bad. Come on, Mom, let's go inside. It's cold. I'm gonna stay out here, honey. Be careful. You gonna run away again? No, just stretching my legs. Doing a little late-night shopping at the same time? It doesn't have to be like this. - Like what? - Difficult. - We just want you gone. - Suzi doesn't. Suzi wants me not gone. Go to hell, Joe. Yeah, I could do that. Take Suzi and tell her you fell off a cliff. I don't think so. No. You don't have to die today. You gonna tell Suzi you killed her mother? I'll figure something out. Aah! Shit! Looking for these? Son of a bitch! Don't need bullets. Ooh? Joe? Stupid idiot. Try and break up my family, will you? Who's the daddy now? What's so funny? I killed Sam. Stuck my knife right in him. These are for you. You killed my husband, you touched my daughter. - I am going to kill you! Die! Breathe in those black flowers! Breathe 'em in! You are gonna die! You scumbag! Oh, God. Joe? Joe?! Joe? Joe! Mom?! Mom? Mom? Mom? Are you OK? Oh, Suzi... - What happened? - I don't know. My head. Mom, where's Joe? - He attacked me. - What? He's gone. Why? We have to go after him! - We won't ever find him. - We have to try! Come on. Suzi, you have to trust me and accept it. - He's not coming back. - What are you talking about? I just... I'm sorry. What did you do? It's not what I did, it's what he did! What?! He killed Dad. He killed your father. He killed my Sam. - No, Dad got shot! - No. No! Joe would never do something like that! He saved us! He told me he stabbed him while we slept! - You're lying! - No! It was him or me! He told me he loved me! You never trust me with anything! I am your mother and I need to protect you, Suzi! So you murdered him? Who would you rather have survived, him or me?! Where's your dozen friends now, huh? You killed my men! And now you'll die. - Damn it. - My turn! Dang it, Suzi, give me the gun. - No. I don't wanna die. Should have thought about that. You don't have to kill me. You're right. I don't have to. I want to. - Ah! - I'm going, I'm going. - Let go. Breathe. Ah! What are we gonna do, Suzi? We gotta get off this hill. You see anything? Yeah. Yes. There's a lake... some boat people. They waved. They seem nice. - DJ told me about them. - Really? We should be there by sundown. - We're due for a bit of luck. - Yeah, we sure are. Hey. Hey, cheer up. There's no time for grumpy Gusses. Put these on. You'll feel better in the water. It'll take all the pain away. Suzi? Are the boat people coming? Yes, yes. Look, they're signaling to us. It won't be long now. They're coming in big, colorful painted boats. It'll get dark soon. Better get going, come on. We're going to swim and swim and swim, and never stop swimming. Till we get to the edge of the world. Heavenly! You'll feel better before you know it! Hey, remember how you used to sing to me? - I love you, Suzi. - I love you too, Mom. What? I thought about what you said. We've woken up. This party ain't over. So, where are we gonna go? Somewhere good. Don't worry, I know people. Hey, I have some black flowers for you. No. Don't worry, this stuff is the best. It's a natural anesthetic. They're gonna heal you and they're gonna make you feel so much better. - Believe me. So, does this make you queen? No, not queen. Just a cockroach. The cockroach always survives. - And we're having a party!
