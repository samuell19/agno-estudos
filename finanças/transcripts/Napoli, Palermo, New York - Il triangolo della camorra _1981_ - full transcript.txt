Take a seat, sit down, come in! At Don Gennaro's, the food is great! At Gennaro's you do not eat to live, but you live to eat! We cook the spaghetti directly with the sea of Naples and the wine with the sun. And everything is served with many beautiful songs, have a seat! This is a nice table, madam here, Miss here and the boys here. Okay? Here you are, the spaghetti! Thank you. Honestly, nobody makes them as good as I do! They're delicious! I knew it! Bambali! Bambali! Bambali! Yes, don Gennaro? - Everything okay with customers? - Yes, all right. And this is a spaghetto from Savarese restaurant? - Eh! - What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for! I? I do not wait for anyone. Ah no one? But what are you waiting for to change job, what are you waiting for? Go and wash the dishes in the kitchen, go! Don Gennaro? You were right! A little salt was missing! God, what a hit on the head! Gennaro, come here, someone is asking for you! Gennaro you're wanted, there's a lady who wants to talk to you. You must always call me when there are beautiful women! Good morning everyone! What a gentleman! You are eating well, right! - Come here. - Where is the beautiful lady? - Here she is. - Who is it? The beautiful woman! Gennaro, dear! - Beautiful woman.. 100 years ago! - Yes, it's good for the stomach! What! How are you? What does 'how are you' mean? How are you! No, I sing, I sing. Here we all sing, madam! okay, okay I'll sing a song for you! Call the bambaniello, go! He's in the crib. but what did you understand, bambaniello with the guitar! - I understood. The chef! - The Nativity! Bambinie'! Bambinie'! I'm coming, here's your guitar! Yes, thank you, this is the moment of the show. I will sing "the sailor's wedding". Mom, there's daddy singing! Alright then, let's go listen to dad singing! I like it too! He's such a good singer, dad! - Good! - Good dad! - Good dad! - Good! Good! Boys, say thank you! charge for the song as well! Four margherita pizzas! Thanks guys, go to the kitchen. - What's up, Teresa? - Gennaro, Inspector Galanti is here. Inspector Galanti? What does he want from you? Do not worry, nothing Teresa! Take the baby and go to the kitchen, I'll talk to the inspector. All right. Inspector Galanti has come for you then! - I have not done anything! - I know you're doing it! Greetings, Don Gennaro! Dear Inspector, why the a honor of your visit? Nothing in particular! I was passing by and I said, let me go visit Savarese! If so, you are welcome! Well? You do not even offer me a drink? Oh, how rude of me, Peppino? Peppino, a little wine! Right away! Forgive me Inspector, I did not know that now you can drink even on duty! No, I'm not on duty! Ah, you're not on duty! So let's drink! Here you do not eat to live but you live to eat! We make spaghetti with the sea of Naples, and the wine with the sun, everything is served with music! - I know. - Peppino, the Inspector knows it very well. You have to tell the customers, got it?! Don Gennaro, it's a habit. Have you finished? Sorry Inspector, it is the habit, I always say the same things! - To our health! - To yours! Good. Really good. It is said that in vino veritas! We have the wine, now only the truth is missing. Inspector, what do you want from me? Just to have a chat. What kind of chat? I would like to understand what is happening in Naples. You read the newspapers, don't you? What's up with all these murders! What do I know? It's murders! Settling of conflicts, Is it a war between Coppola and Aniello? What are they? You must have an idea, right? Inspector, I have not thought about these things for a long time And you know it! But you have a lot of old friends who still come to see you! And when things like that happen, usually people talk about them, discuss about them. Here, look, even Don Francesco is in Naples! Inspector, that Don Francesco is back from America, I do not know anything! The only thing I know, he invited me for his birthday. I'm his friend and I'm going there out of respect. And that's all. And you want me to believe, that Gennaro Savarese, Godson of don Francesco Biancone, the chief of chiefs, does not know anything about anything? Inspector, that Don Francesco, my friend, is chief of the chiefs, as you say, I know nothing about. I know only one thing, Inspector Don Gennaro Savarese is dead, for the Camorra and the police! Friends and enemies, they can come here whenever they want. The restaurant is at their disposal. but only to eat and drink, Inspector! You have already drunk, do you also want to eat? No thanks. Now forgive me, I have customers waiting for me. I need to go to the kitchen to help my wife. Goodbye Inspector. What are we going to do at this party, Gennaro! Teresa, hurry, it's late, come on! I thought that now we had nothing more to do with these people, - and instead - And instead what? We did a lot to get out of the loop, do you think that now we go to the party and get back in the loop? What have you got in your head, Teresa? Everything is possible! I'm afraid Gennaro! What are you afraid of? These are dangerous people! The further away you are from them, the better! We are so comfortable in our house! Why do we care about Don Francesco! You forget, that Don Francesco was my baptism godfather. I could not refuse this invitation! Come on, Teresa, I promise we'll be there only for a short while, we give our best wishes and come back home. Don't be upset! Smile! All right, as you wish! And now it's your turn, go! It's the last battleship you have! - If you find it, let's see! - But I will destroy you! - Only if you find it! - I will sink it! go, go, go, go! - Hello? - Hello! - Hello! - Hello! I'm ready, are you ready? - I'm ready. - Three B! Water! Are you sure? I'm very sure, do not look. Four B! Four B? Water. - Very sure. - Five B! Five beers? No beers, we're not in pub! All right, water. Seven B! Water! Damn! But how the fuck you put these ships? how do you put them? On the water, horizontally. Horizontally, no, I put them vertically! Not it's not a ship, it is a submarine! Therefore, being underwater, you can not see it, stupid! God! So I did not understand anything! You're stupid, you're stupid, these are games for smart people, shut up, shut up! - I will get a tutor! - Shut up, shut up, so the story? - And America. - What were you doing? We were helping the kid study. - It's true. - Peppino, please. Keep an eye on the boy. Please, do you understand? do not worry, he'll study with me! Give a kiss to dad, be careful! Be good! Teresa, let's go. - Goodbye don Gennaro. - Goodbye madam - Bye Peppino! See you later. Did you see that Gennaro also knows that you're stupid? Hey, you have to tell me something. - Yes - How come this submarine, this fucking submarine, or whatever the fuck you call it, cannot be seen? You don't see it? It's here! And where is it? It's underneath there, so you can not hit it, you idiot! You can not do smart games! A moment Peppino, here I did not understand, - It was the slap! - I have good nose and eyes. No, it's not the slap, here I can not see clearly! - Let's play another game! - And let's do another one! - A sheet to me and a sheet to you. - A sheet to you and one to me. - A sheet to you. - A sheet to me and your mother for you! Hurray, great! Hurray! Hurray! On top of this cake, There are 60 candles! They are too many! Who put them has got it wrong! There are 10 more! They had to be 50 candles! And not 60. Because with the love you have shown me, I'm rejuvenated by 10 years tonight! Your presence, here sincere, spontaneous, made me live again the time when I was in Naples. Thank you! Thank you! If you allow me, the most beautiful gift, is this evening! I expect it, from these two guys, see? Guys, I want this gift from you, I demand it! Come on! Aniello! Coppola! Here, good! Silence! And to celebrate, this beautiful event, my buddy Gennariello, will sing us a beautiful song! Come on sing! - Do not make me pray you! - All right. "In love with you," maestro! Gennaro, can we go home after this? The kid is alone. - In the hands of those two .. - All right. - All right. - Promised? - My love! He sings with his heart! Good boy! Listen to how he sings, listen up! - Stop everyone, this is a robbery! - God! Stop! Stop there! Help! Oh my God! What happened? - What have you done? - A pain! It's nothing! You stop! Bravo, my love! Fantastic! Great! Bravo, you're wonderful Gennariello! Hey no, hey! Stop everyone, do not move! Nobody moves! No one moves! - I said everything! - Take out your wallet! Move! I'll shoot you, you know! Where is the wallet? Bastards! And you, give me the watch! - Cry out! - No! No one moves! Stop! You do not move. You do not move. It's all over, let's go home, Masaniello awaits us, let's go my love, let's go. You were right not wanting to come. God! Oh God, what's wrong? The blood! Teresa, no! They killed my wife! Our son will cry so much, Teresa! Do not leave me my love! I can't live without you, do not abandon me, do not abandon Teresa! Oh God! God! We have our luck, a team to win the championship! No championship, if they jump on us we are screwed! Don't jinx us! Are you stupid or what? You have to accept that if it collapses, everything collapses! Dad, I want to come with you. Yes, dad will not leave you, I'm coming to get you soon! - Do not leave me. - Sister, I only have him. Please! Do not worry, He will have everything he needs! - Thank you. - No, I want to go with you - Yes, dear. - I want to go with you! Dad! Come on, let's go play. Dad! Dad! Masaniello! My handsome son. Dad will never leave you! You must understand you have grown up. I am coming back, do you understand? To get you. Come Masaniello, dad will be back soon! My daddy! Son, my beautiful son! Come Masaniello, come. Dad! Dad! You are my heart! - Come back soon. - Dad loves you. Only you. We are looking for Malvasia! We said we are looking for Malvasia! Whoever you are, we are looking for Malvasia! Whoever you are, Don't bust my balls! Right! Thank you. - So? - Nobody saw him. Yet he can not be gone! For me, we are wasting time. Malvasia is a petty criminal! Peppino, no professional would risk a similar hit! So you have to search among the loose dogs! Those living on the edge of mafia. You think that Malvasia, Malvasia is one these criminals. If we find him, we also find the killers of my wife. I have the impression that this car is following us. What are you talking about? I have the impression that this car is following us! - but it's all an impression! - Look back. What are you doing, look forward! Look back. Look forward! where the fuck do I have to watch? Forward, back, back forward. - I'm looking back. - So you know what we do? I'll give you the steering wheel and you drive! - And I look back. - Hurry, speed up, go! Go! They blocked the way! Surrender! And get off with your hands up! - I have a great idea. - And what is this idea? And what is this cannon? With this I did the Vietnam war! You with this? I destroyed all the buildings! And why in Vietnam, are there buildings? Those few that were there, I destroyed them all. - Put it here, put it here! - God, be careful that it blows up! - Run, run fast! - Hurry, let's run! With this you blew up the building of Vietnam! - Yes! - I blow up Vesuvius! Wait a minute, I'll show you! Shoot! Damned you idiot! - What happened? - But where did you shoot? At the car! You shot at mine, though! Oh God! Oh my God! It's people who shoot easily, easily. Ruthless, ruthless people. Filthy bastards. Bastards who blow up cars! You blow up cars! I blow up cars! but what are you saying idiot! In short, it is better not to look for Malvasia, listen to me. You're right, Peppino. We'd better not look for him anymore. It must be him, to look for us. When? - But this is a hole! - Yup. And the worm will come out of the hole! News? Have you come another time to look for Malvasia? No, no, no we aren't looking for him anymore! This time he will look for us! If he wants to see his woman again! Got it? - Yes. - Understood. Good morning. One moment! Look who's here! Dear Malvasia, how are we doing, fine? Where is she? - Who? - Who? Who? Where is Maria? Boys, don't joke around don't joke with me. This is for those four dogs you sent me! It was not me who sent them, believe me Save! And who was it? - Speak! Who was it? - I do not know! I do not know. You can even kill me, but I do not know. but why are you hiding, why? Why? Why, and you ask me that? Because it's bad times, that's why! What do you mean, talk! Speak, what do you mean? Leave the world alone as it is. But why? Why you want to put me in trouble! What kind of trouble? Where is Maria? She's in a safe place. Tell me what you know and I'll show her to you right away! No! Now! Come on, tell me. Speak before I'll strangle you, talk! It wasn't those loose dogs that you think to do the robbery! And how can you be so sure, Malvasia ?! I know. Why? By now they would have already brought me everything, instead I haven't seen anyone, neither here nor elsewhere! And that's all I know. And now you have to keep the word! For what you are! Where is Maria? Maria eh? But could not you talk before? I was suffocating inside that closet! Thanks Savarese! Watch out, Malvasia! Let's go! Savarese! but then, who did this robbery? Dear Peppino, it was not a robbery. Ah! Jesus! So who was it? Piece of shit! Here, I should not do it, but since it's about you! They are all at your disposal! Very kind of you, thanks. - Are you the chef? - What do you want? I'm Gennaro Savarese! That lady's husband? Yes. Tell me, tell me! What can I do for you? I would like to know how the evening of the robbery went! Those four gentlemen, have they passed through here? Yes, they gave me a first class service! They did nothing that could identify them. So much so, that the police did not consider it appropriate to question us! Sometimes a detail, a sign, a voice is enough. - You do not remember anything? - No, no. Wait! Now I remember, there was one thing. Please, tell me. It's such an insignificant detail! - Please tell me. - I do not even know if it can help you! Tell me. So we were here, all three, with our hands up, at one point, one of the criminals slams against the table and breaks a glass with water. So what does he do? He leaves the gun, grabs his hand and starts crying, as if he were a child! Then, one of the other three slapped him! And he calmed down instantly! He resumed the gun, and went out with the others, from that side. - That's all. - He must have had a bad cut. No, it was just a scratch! Nothing serious, just a drop of blood! I do not know why, he did all that mess. Strange, no? Very strange. Savarese? Inspector Galanti, what a balls breaker! I've been looking for you for three days! Inspector, Naples is big! What did you come here to do? Do not you know? No. I came to bring flowers to the family tomb. Is that okay? You said that Gennaro Savarese was dead! And that the new Gennaro, was concerned only with his restaurant. It doesn't look like that now. And what does it matter!? Huge! On Gennaro Savarese, there is a file this tall in the office! Do not play with the fire, Gennaro! All I need is to just blow the dust! Blow this dust away, I don't care. To move forward, the society has set some rules, that we are all required to respect! And who does not respect them? Who does not respect them pays. And who is paying for my wife's death, Inspector? We are investigating! I'm paying, Inspector! We are always the ones who pay. justice does not care and I do not care about it! Careful how you move Gennaro, if you do something wrong... You said that those who do wrong pay, and I am already paying too much, I can not pay anymore! See you later, Inspector! Now he too has to be the middle of all these sons of bitches! Come on, come and play with me! Get the ball! Come and get it! Come on, come play with me! - Come! - I do not feel like it. Come on, I've got the ball, let's go Masaniello! - I do not feel like it. - Go play somewhere else! Cute! Here comes Don Gennaro, stay with the boy. Yes, do not worry, I'll take care of him. Masaniello, let's play a little bit. - Good morning. - Good morning doctor! How are you? So and so. - What about you? - Not bad. - Explain something. - Tell me. Why a man who is risking his life, suddenly stops for a scratch on his finger?! I do not know. Probably, the sight of blood terrifies him! So much so as to make him lose his head? Evidently, he is a hemophiliac, a hemorrhagic! but what is it, an illness? Yes and those affected, live constantly under terror, to die of hemorrhage. Sometimes even a small cut is enough! Thank you, Doctor. but why are you asking me this question? No, a friend of mine! Ah understood! - Hey! - Who is it? Come, get in, I have to talk to you. It will be for another time, now I'm in a hurry. Come on, I promised Don Francesco to protect you! But if you go crazy, it becomes difficult, you know! Let my men take care of it, Gennaro! I thank you, both you and Don Francesco. But this, Coppola, is my own thing. Go go! Get a coffee. But really, I could not! Coffee does not hurt. It is not possible. Come on, give me this pleasure! What day did you say? The night of September 3rd. The night of September 3? Now let's see. Was it Saturday? Yes, Saturday. Exactly. At 23:45 we hospitalized a hemophiliac, you are right. A man? "A man?". - I can be in trouble for this! - Please tell me the name! Salvatore Canotta. Salvatore Canotta. Is that you Salvatore Canotta? Yes, what is it? Who are you? What do you want from me? Who ordered the robbery? What are you saying? What are you looking for? Speak, you bastard! Give me the name! Speak, bastard! I swear I do not know what you're talking about! You do not know anything eh? Filthy piece of garbage! I swear I know nothing! You do not know anything eh? - No. - You do not know anything? Until I stab your feet and you will see... The blood. I swear I know nothing! - Speak! Speak or I'll put it in your heart! - No! A moment, all right. Coppola. What? - Does this name mean anything to you? - Coppola. It was Coppola! Inspector Galanti. Was it a dove? Yes, the usual bird! It was a wrong tip. Savarese, Canotta is dead and now you will get 30 years! You are losing time, Inspector! The murderers are others. Do not worry, these are things that concern us! The law. You always arrive a little late, you of the law eh? I work 24 hours a day. And what do you need? Nothing! You take 10 and justice puts 11 out. Stop it! I'll give you a proposal, Inspector. You pretend you did not arrest me, and I, within a few days, will bring you the head of someone very important to you. Who for example? Big people. Do you have proof? Me, evidence? Do you need evidence from me? Give me at least one trace! It's a game that I want to play! Savarese, in jail there is little to play! I made you the proposal, you give it a little thought. What a son of a bitch! Good luck. Cards to madam. Cards? Card. Card. Card? Here it is. Play your cards! Please, the six wins! This gentleman won. - What's up, Michele? - And what do I know! - Hurry, go see! Who is this? Good good good. Look how many filthy bastards there are! You are all under arrest! Take them away, come on! Come on, everyone out! It does not end like this, Inspector! It will end worse if you do not move! Go! Go away, all out, everyone! Take them out! Go! Away! Walk! Go, go! Leave me! Inspector! What do you want? What do you want, leave me! Inspector! All right Inspector! Good, let's go! The Inspector has arrived! - The inspector! - Here is Galanti! Miraculous hunt, Inspector? - Tell us something! - Only small fish, for now can you give us confirmation?> Yes, more or less. All placed managed by men related to the Camorra? This will be the judge to say it! if all the arrests were confirmed, tell us, it would be a blow to organized crime! It would be a big step forward! but to stop organized crime, we need to get to the leaders. Inspector Galanti is busting our balls! If those do not open the mouths, there should not be problems for you, at least for the moment! It's not enough, lawyer, I want them all out! The premises must continue to work! Let's hope to find some legal cavil! Lawyer, it takes more! Take the car, let's go out. Now you prepare yourself, as a good girl, I'll take you home and see you later! As you like. Excuse me, will it not be better if things get calmer? If I want to get my friends out of jail, I have to get to work! You are very stubborn, eh! Here, look! There is not even one left inside! all released! I understand your anger! I did what I could! I gave you free hand! And what was it good for? Nothing! It's not on me that you have to take it out. Excuse me. You know it well. It is not the first time that we clash with the judiciary. And it will not even be the last! We should eliminate them one by one! And then take them to the judge! Right! But we can not do it! Right. We. Can't. I'll make you a proposal, Inspector! In few days, I'll bring you the head of someone, who is very important to you. And now what is it? Nothing. See you later, Mr Commissioner. - Take some holidays. - Holidays? You deserve it! You've worked too hard! Now go rest. Listen to me, go! See you later. Happy holiday. I understood. It's a game that I want to play! I made you the proposal, you give it a little thought! Have they brought the flowers? Not yet! And when are they going to?! - I do not know! - I do not know, here it is! I do not know and this is the habit. I do not know, I do not know. - Hey don Peppino. - Here I am, Simone! See you another time! - I thought you had something... - Yes, yes I have so many things... But another time! Sorry, but I came on purpose from Salerno, Hey, we say hello. There you are too! Well! but what are you doing here? you called us! Who called you? I! I called you! And you, asshole, what are you doing there? He forced me! What do you want from me? I wanted to tell you that if this time went well for you, the next one will not be the same! You are breaking every limit, Inspector. - The magistrate - I'll find one who will agree with me. You're playing with the fire, Inspector. And you with me. It's worse. I warned you. And now let's see if you do some other bullshit! Inspector Galanti! What happened? Call the police! Madam, do not touch him, he can not get up! Catch this, catch it! What are we going to do at this party, Gennaro? Air game, Air game, go! Play, play! Are you going to pass it or not? - Are you Savarese? - Yes. Tomorrow morning, go to the infirmary and get ready. An ambulance comes and takes you out of jail! Who are you? Who sends you here? Do not think about it, some friends. Friends? From the Xrays, you can clearly see the dynamics of the accident. - He's here. - It's clear! Doctor? Can you leave us alone? Sure! Sure! Please have a seat! Thanks sister. Inspector Galanti? Come in. What kind of a joke is this, Inspector? Cops must have good legs, and mine aren't anymore. I heard of the attack! But, I did not believe it. Paraplegia. The doctor said so. - I'm sorry. - Things that happen to the living! Let's get to the point. Surely you're wondering, why I made you get out of jail! Escape! I got you in, and I had to let you out! That's all. Let's say, that I felt guilty. Let's not say bullshit, Inspector! It is the truth. You are a son of a bitch! There must be a reason, Inspector. Did you want to stay in jail? Come on, - tell me? - I want to understand. I want to understand. Why a man like you, a man of law, like Inspector Galanti, helps a killer, to escape! Explain this to me! I have to understand it. There's nothing to understand, Gennaro. If you do not feel well, go back inside, and let your wife's murderers laugh at you! It's strange, that you worry only now, about my wife's murderers! I could not then! No, the reason is another! You want me to do what you can not do now! This is the truth! Even if it were true? Isn’t it what you proposed to me in the car? Put yourself in my place? Back then I was not accused! And I was not a fugitive. Listen Gennaro, do you still have the intentions you had before? Or did prison jumble you? I never give up! Who has to pay, will pay! When Gennaro, when? In 20 years? When you'll get out of prison old and stupid? This is what you say. You're talking too much Gennaro. If you really want to move, move! I'm giving you the chance! As for why, think about what you want. This is reality. Reality! The news of the escape was in all the newspapers! And you do not know anything, eh? But where the hell do you live! I need smart guys. Guys with balls! You, on the other hand, seem to me all blind and deaf. Don't speak like this, Totò! We have our problems too! We need to solve them nonetheless. On the contrary, we have done everything possible, to not even bother you, to let you know! In my opinion, in my opinion, you're worrying too much! We have taken care of the Inspector, there's no problem to take care of Gennaro Savarese! It's different! Why so?! - It's different! - Yes. Savarese is not just anyone! Savarese was a smart man! Okay, but... And if it weren't for his wife here, now, at my place, - it would be him! - Oh yes! - Do you know or not? He seems to scare you. Mardella! Nobody scares me! I'm telling you this, because I do not want you to underestimate him, especially now! A wounded beast is worth three times more. And now, Savarese is a wounded beast with a thirst for revenge! What can one man do?! - Alone! - Alone - Alone! You can not escape from prison alone, as he did! Someone is helping him! Who? I do not know this and it worries me. so I tell you, that you have to keep your eyes open! I now have to go to Palermo for a few days. so be careful! Inform the men. Double the surveillance in all the premises, inside and out! Gennaro is an ugly beast, and he's not alone. Morra! Stop like this! I just want to talk to you! I just wanted to talk to you, Morra. You wanted it. Stop like this and do not move, Bardella! Now you and me, let's go for a ride above San Liberale. Come on, come on! Do not make a move, I'll shoot you in the forehead. Walk, walk! Now slowly, you'll tell me where Coppola is. See what a beautiful view! You better talk! Because if you die here, they won't even find your bones! Where is Coppola? Speak, where is Coppola? Gennaro, it is useless! I do not know anything, I do not know anything! Speak bastard, where is Coppola? - Gennaro no! - Speak, where is Coppola? Before I throw you off the mountain, talk! All right Gennaro, you won, I'll tell you where Coppola is! Very good, Coppola! - What do you want? - Here it is, see? That's our character, see? See how nervous he is! No, I see her as she is moving! No, I talk about him, his man have not arrived yet! Don't move, do not touch, you can't touch these! You understand, you just have to watch! Go, go, go please go, go. - And why do you touch? - I am the boss. Don Gennaro! Speak, it was all a plan to eliminate Aniello eh? I do not know, I was not even at that party, I swear! The robbery was just an excuse eh? Speak! I do not know, I do not know. Such a great plan of Coppola, what a bastard! Damn killer, talk! Enough, enough! Where is Coppola? - Speak! - Yes. - Before I rip your head off! - Yes, yes! Yes Yes Yes Yes! I'll tell you everything, but first you have to give me the word of honor, that you will let me go! The place. Coppola escaped to Sicily! You must tell me the city! Sicily is so big! The city! Palermo! Mr Savarese? - Marshal Patarina? - Yes, sir! I bring you the greetings of Inspector Galanti. Always honored to serve the Inspector! So? What news do you have for me? I followed them as I was ordered. Come, I show you where they accompanied Coppola. And this is Officer Oca! We broadcast 24 hours a day cartoons, movies, musical performances, everything. Then at some point, according to the time and day established, the transmission on air is interrupted and this advertisement appears. And this is the signal. exactly. The motorboat with the goods, receives it via the TV on board, and understands the green light to proceed. At the same time, we reach the beach, we pick up the goods from the motorboat And that's it! It seems like a perfect system! Very much so! However, for more guarantees, tonight you can attend directly, to the operation, what do you say? I say, that the system costs. It's my organization. Can I do a telex? Of course! I want to communicate, the conclusion of our deal, to my boss! Come, come with me. friend of man, not always the man is the best friend of the dog "Yet the dog continues to show man his loyalty." show you a cartoon.> Here we are. There! Coppola! I'm waiting for you! I'm here. but what is this bullshit? I know what it is! - Hurry, to the studios! - Do as he tells you! Vito Coppola! Marshal Patarina? What happened? - What did they do to you? - I got shot! Coppola. Studios. Here, doctor, we have included the encrypted message, found by Savarese in Palermo, in a teletype set for reading. The message says: "We await your arrival in New York, 12:00 am fox." At this time Coppola, has already run away! Bad for him in New York, dear Inspector! Over there I have many friends. Taxi! - Taxi! - Where do you have to go? Excuse me, please, can you take me to Brooklyn? the 18th Street. Are you Italian? - Yes, yes. - I'm from Naples too! Get in, what a pleasure! Of course I had to meet Neapolitans! What's up Paesano? You're nervous? Go to Broadway! Pull over when I tell you, do you understand, Paesa'? Ok Paesa'! Thank you, thank you! You are welcome! The bastard is lost in traffic! Now! Sorry! Yes? Ah! Let him pass! Sorry, my old dear friend! - Dear Gennarino! - My dear friend! Welcome to my home! - Thank you, the pleasure is all mine! - How are you? I say, why you did not tell me, blessed son, why? By now you would not be in the middle of trouble! After Teresa's death, I lost my head I only thought about revenge. Yes, I'll settle the question. Coppola will pay for what he did to you, and for what he did to me. I came to Naples specifically, to make him make peace with Aniello. He shouldn't have killed him in my presence. Bastards do not look at anyone in the eye! Are you sure he's here in NY? Indeed. I came here on purpose. And you must help me! Don't worry, you can go back to Naples. I will take care of Coppola. No. You must help me find him. I have to take care of him myself! It's a personal affair. Gennaro, it's the same thing. Listen to me, go back to Italy Teresa will be avenged the same. It's not the same thing and you know it. Ok, what do you need? cars, men dollars? I will provide you with everything! Thank you very much. All ok? You are very lucky. - Who are you? - Friends. Friends? Don Francesco sends you? Yes. Good morning Vincenzo. Hi Gennaro! - Good morning. - Eh Gennaro! I heard what happened to you. That's why I'm here! And you must help me! And do not tell me no! Giovanni, where is Coppola? Coppola? - Vincenzo! - I swear! - No, I haven't seen him! - No! You want me to believe that with so many friends in Brooklyn, nobody knows anything? No, maybe Ciccillo knows! All right, come on. Come, come, we'll go with you! Cicci, go to the kitchen! All right. - Don Gennaro! - Good morning. Please! Do you allow two words? - Please make yourself comfortable! Cicci', if you do not give me a hand, you Neapolitan, - who will! - Don Francesco! If he says he helps you, he will certainly help you! Yes, but I'm in a hurry! And then don Francesco has his problems. And we have ours! You must understand, we have been here for many years now, and we do not know anyone. Naples is very far! No! I do not agree! Naples is behind the alley! Tell the truth, you are scared? No don Gennaro, we have a family is different! I also had a family! And now, I do not have my wife anymore! And it's not right. Please Cicci', give me a hand! Help me find Coppola! Leave everything as it is, don Gennaro. It's better! Leave it alone, leave it alone, this word is a torment! What do you want to do! We are unfortunate, you know that! The world is filthy, and to live we have to work hard! I had come here, convinced to find some friends, and instead! - Don Gennaro! - Try to understand. Good day. Well, I have men, they are not able to do their job! What? Ah! This seems a good idea. I believe, too, that there is nothing else to do now! Very well. Well. Hello? Is that you, Gennaro Savarese? Yes, it's me. Wait on the phone. - Dad! - Masaniello? Where are you, hello? - In America! - In America? Hello? Hello Masaniello! Hello! Savarese, if you want to see your son alive again, come back to Italy! Hello? Hello? Hello? What a coward. Did they really order you to go back to Naples? And what should I do! Ask yourself, rather, what you can do! And what can I do? Nothing. Nothing. We can not do anything anymore, dear Gennaro! You must follow their advice, if you care about the child. These cowards have cut my legs! It is useless to recriminate my friend! We lost. Pack your bags and go back to Naples, then we'll see. In Naples? Sooner or later I'll find Coppola. And then, you'll see! Be calm. Who is it? Don Gennaro, it's Ciccillo, my wife is here too, can we come in? Ciccillo? Come in. Come, come, do not be afraid. What do you want? Don Gennaro, you were right when you told us that Naples is behind the alley. Ruthless people! We have decided to help you. We know where Coppola is. Hey, let's get up! Yes. Keep your eyes open! As soon as you move, you're dead. Is this what you were looking for? What do you want? Talk, you piece of shit, where is my son? I do not understand! Speak before I shoot you in the forehead, talk! But I do not know, what do you want, I do not know! You do not know eh? I'll let you know. But is this gas? What are you doing? Stop! Speak, where is my son? Stop! Where is my son, talk! Ok, ok okay. I'll give you two minutes. Come on down and don't do stupid things, Coppola! Walk. Get off. Walk! - Who is it? - It's me, open! All right. Calm down, if you do not want me to shoot you in the face. Are there others? No. Walk. Come on get down. He is here. - Dad? - Masaniello! - Come to daddy! - Dad! - It's all over! - Dad! Daddy will not leave you anymore, hug me! Masaniello, can you do a favor to daddy? - There's a car outside. - Yes get in the car and wait for me and do not move for any reason, go! Dad, do not worry! I'll be right with you! I would like to know why you didn't keep the boy in Naples In Naples? In Naples you have too many friends! Too many friends eh? And now what do you want to do Gennaro? Gennaro, what do you want to do? You wanted the baby and you got him! What do you want, you want to kill me? But you will never go back to Naples! You do not scare me. And then shoot! If I were you I wouldn't do it. Throw the gun on the floor, Gennaro! Finally! My friend! So it was you together with Coppola? To organize the attack on Aniello! Now I understand everything. Gennaro, it's too late. Too late. And who expected it! My friend! I had so much respect for you! I'm sorry, I'm sorry for your wife's death, but it wasn't planned. I could not do anything for her! And you, you've come to know too many things. Enough, I have to kill you! Don Francesco, you're a piece of shit! Inspector Galanti? Miraculously healed! - Yeah! - Dad! Dad, is everything over? Yes! And who is he? Sergeant Martinez Interpol. Ah! I've always kept an eye on you, Gennaro! All studied eh! Also the legs paralysis. Yep, that too! It seems a contradiction but I had to lock them, to run better. Don Francesco, could not have come to Naples, just to put peace between the two! That was the reason why you let me escape! You have used me. I'm sorry Gennaro, but this was the only system to expose don Francesco. Inspector, the camorra does not end here. And there will not be another Savarese! It was my wife's death that forced me to help you. But the Camorra, despite you, keeps going. Get an ambulance! - Ok. - Yes, I know, Gennaro. but I can always hope in the help of another son of a bitch, like you! Careful! It's a personal fact, take care of the boy! The boy! Coppola! The race is over! Dad! Dad! Dad! It's over! It's all over Masaniello!
