FISCAL INCENTIVE FOR INVESTMENTS IN NATIONAL MOVIE INDUSTRY WITH THE SUPPORT OF Turn it down, Amanda. - Amanda. - What? - You'll hurt yourself. - No. Amanda, do as your mom says. You're hurting me. I don't want to go. We're not going to argue. The Mexican Navy took down seven criminals in the State of Zacatecas, among them are two women. Now, the report. This Tuesday morning, the Mexican Navy carried out a raid in the district of Guadalupe in an attempt to take out an organized crime cell. The police's long weapons and grenades woke up the neighbors, who, at 4:00 a.m., were forced to hide under the beds and in bathrooms, as the explosions continued. As I stated, the raid resulted in seven deceased, five men and two women. An unknown number of members of the alleged safe house managed to escape the raid, resulting in a chase in several parts of the metropolitan area. Do you need the cord? There were no military or civilian casualties. No, the seven people who died were in the house where the raid took place. And everything suggests it was a safe house. - It's not here. - Forensics from the Attorney General's Office came to collect the bodies and identify... Come on, Amanda. Go away. We lost a life because of you. Mom, tell her to let me play. Amanda, please, don't be selfish. Why are we going? I've told you already, we're going to see Granny. Michelle went to Los Angeles, Paulina, to Acapulco. Why can't we ever go somewhere else? As if we never went places. That's all we do. We visited Granny three times this year. We have to appreciate our time with her while she's with us. I like making cookies with Granny. You see? Luckily, she doesn't have much more time. Amanda! Don't say that. Well, she must've heard it from you. Amanda, what's this? This is too salty. - Mom. - Don't "mom" me. We're on vacation. Hey. We talked about this. Thank you. This should not be here in the front. Let's go. Here. Your chips. And now I am I thought I was dying When you walked away But now I feel better And I'll try to forget you You left without telling me You left me like a forgotten dog You'll pay for this You'll remember the day you abandoned me Who are you? I'm... - An animal? - Yes. Am I real? No. What color is my hair? Your hair... blonde. Orange blonde. - Reddish? - Yes. I don't know. - Am I a boy or a girl? - Boy. Am I... - a princess? - Yes. Please. Come on, give... me that. All right. Give me. Girls, there's the lake. It's beautiful. Can we stop? Come on. Do you have your shoes on? - Yes. - Come on. Let's go! Be careful. All right. Here we go. Here we go. Let's go. There. That one didn't skip, it sank. Tell me how to do it. I've already told you. You could at least teach her that. Sweetie. I'll teach you. Let's see. Look. You have to throw the stone on its side, so it'll skip on the water, see? But you throw it from down here. Watch this. You focus... and... Did you see it? - Do you want to try? - Yes. This one. We have to find a flat one. Really flat. Be careful, Andrea. Dad! - What happened? - Look. Wow. It's so pretty. It must be volcanic. Keep it. You just found a rock for good luck. You keep this one. Don't throw it. Let's go. Be careful. - Let me see. - No. Who wants that stupid rock? It's all right, honey. Relax. Where's the Dramamine? It's in the brown pack, in the little pocket. It's all right. - It's not here. Where is it? - In the front pocket. Relax, honey. - It's not here. - Look harder! What the hell do you think I'm doing? It's all right. Do you feel better? Let's wash your hands. Good afternoon. It's 5:15 p.m. It's 75 degrees in Puerto de Veracruz. Next, the second movement from "Trio No. 2 in E-flat" for piano, violin and cello by Franz Schubert. I prefer the version from the vampire movie. Yes, it's nice. It's a little slower. Moderato. It's not slower, it's moderato. It's going to die. Who, honey? The dog. Which dog? The one we just passed. I think it's this one. The little teeth up. Good. To the other side. Hurry up, Andrea. Relax, please! - Where are you going? - To look around. Mrs. Mónica. You made an appointment for Japanese acupressure. Please. Hello. Go swim. Go ahead and enjoy it. Amanda, put it on mute. And how will I know if I get a message? I'll take it from you. Can you watch your sister? Tell me if you have thought Of me lately Great. Thank you. Tell your sister to come to the table. Andrea! Joel said you should come and eat something. Andrea! Andrea! I'm not hungry. She said she's not hungry. I heard her. Are you hungry? Not really. Would you like a shrimp? I don't like shrimp. Since when? Since ever. But you liked shrimps when you were little. You dummy. Enough. Damn flies. I made an appointment for us. Tomorrow. And the girls? It'd be here in the room. Amanda can watch Andrea for a while. She only cares about her phone. Do you think she'll watch Andrea? I mean... if she does this, we can give her more time with her phone, right? Great. And meanwhile, we get some rest. It's not that terrible if we don't spend every minute with them. - Moni. - What? - What do we do now? - What? What do we do now? We relax. - Come and swim with me. - No. - Come on. - I said no. How brave of you to keep that rock. - Why? - You found it too easily. Lava is rising up. There's going to be an eruption, and we'll all die because of you. - You're lying. - Burnt to death. You don't even know what that means. Burnt to death! I'm relaxed enough for the day. Where are you going? I'll tell Amanda to come. I'm sure she likes these things. But we said it was a day for us. Yes, Moni, but it's enough for me. Your mom needs you to go to the spa. - And you? - I'm fine. You go. Thanks, Daddy. Will you come swimming with me? No, honey, later. Come on. Won't you? Please? All right. I'll give you a head start of two seconds. Fly! Sweetie. It's time to get out. Good. Is it true that the volcano is going to erupt, and we'll all die? No. Who told you that? Volcanoes don't erupt out of nowhere. So we're not going to die? No! Not right now. We will, eventually. But not for a very long time. Don't get sad. You don't need to worry about it. - Hey. - Hey. What's wrong? What's the matter, honey? - What happened? - Nothing. She thinks we'll die. Why would you tell her something like that? Do you think I told her that? I don't know where she heard that? It's all right. We're all going to be fine. All right? Good. Would you like some apple pie? A big one? All right. Would you go help your sister get changed? I'll go order dinner. Everything is going to be all right. Moni. Moni. Burnt to death. Mom. - Seven, eight, nine, ten. Bingo! - Bingo! Let's see. - Wins 100. Bank. - What? - Pay 100. - Bank, you're going too slow. I'm getting things organized. Don't forget your burger, please. Here. - Here, eat. - Fine. Don't touch the money with the... You're all greasy. One, two, three, four. - Six, seven, eight. - Can I have a napkin? - Nine. - All right. Should I buy it or not? - No, I won't buy it. - You're not buying it? - All right. - Let's see. All right. I'll go now. If I get a million, I win. No! You eat, please. Yes. Eat now, please. Fine. We used to talk until the sunrise. - Is that a complaint? - No. No, I'm just nostalgic. Here's the menu. - Thanks. - Sure. - Do you have beer by the bottle? - Yes, Victoria. Would you like one? Yes, one Victoria, please. This is a particular choice. There weren't many options. The hotel is nice though. Yes, but it's quite boring. I planned these vacations for us to relax. Mónica, do you really think I want to be confined to the spa? - I don't know, but... - Here. - Thank you. - Sure. Shall we order another one? - Are you going to ignore me all night? - Yes, until I fall asleep. Enough, Moni. Please. I understand you meant well, but you have to understand I don't like being locked up in the hotel, let alone in the spa. And why didn't you tell me before? Because I know you like it. Are we good? - Yes, but... - No, look at me. - Peace. - OK, but I'm still mad. Shall we order another one? Can I have another one? This place is awful. Don't say that. You used to like places like this. Yes, but that's the good thing about growing up. Or should I say growing old? This is my sad story I get anxious and feel confused Because nobody can console my heart Come. I get crazy if I don't have you I feel strange and all the time I hope you'll come back to me, my love In despair and missing your hair Your red lips and those black eyes That sweet stare that won me over I desperately watch the time go by Running by along with the memories of you And I still wait for you, love There's no spring since you left There's no sun And the flowers withered away The ones you planted Just like this heart Which dies for you If you are not here If you don't come back My heart dies That's how it is! In despair and missing your hair Your red lips and those black eyes That sweet stare That won me over Desperately watch the time go by Running by along with the memories of you And I still wait for you, love There's no spring since you left There's no sun And the flowers withered away Jeez. - Let's go. - Yes. Let's go. Come here, you pussy! Mom, is that you? Yes, honey, it's us. We're back. Mom, I had a nightmare. I'll go sleep with you, honey. Go ahead. Let's go, sweetie. Come here. When we were at the lake, picking up stones, I got hurt, and now I'm bleeding. Last night... Let's go. - I don't want to leave. - Me neither. Don't you want to see your Granny? We've seen her many times. Bet she really wants to see you, princess. In fact, we'll go to the beach. As soon as your mom is back. All right? Come on. Let's go. You do want to go. Look. Bye, Andrea. Bye, Amanda. Bye, Dad. Good afternoon. Turn off the car. - Where are you going? - To Tamiahua. - Where are you from? - DF. - Reason for the trip? - Family vacation. Do you have any sort of guns or drugs? If we did, we wouldn't tell you. - Amanda. - No, sir. Of course not. Get out of the car. - Is something wrong? - Get out of the car. ID, please. Get out of the car. Come with me. - Hey. - Stay with your mom. I'll be right back. Give me that. You can't take pictures. - Sir, I think deleting those is enough. - Give me that phone. Amanda, please, delete the pictures. You can go. Leave. As soon as my husband comes back. Move. Amanda, stop that. And what should I do? I don't know. Hang out and talk to your sister. We were having a phone-free vacation, girl. Besides, we almost got arrested because of that thing. Almost. What are those bags for? So worms can't eat the plantains. Can we grill plantains when we get there? Why not now? You know we can't be late. Come on. Let's do it. - If they're green they're not good? - Right. If you put salt on them, they're good. You'll see. There's no signal. Good. If there's no signal, tough luck. You'll finally grant us the honor of your presence. So a beer? Come on, it's hot. Let's go get a beer. - Hello. - Hello. - Good afternoon. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Hey. I'll be right there. How much for a stalk? - They're not for sale, sir. - What do you mean? We'll buy one at the market - and cook it later. - Hey, wait. One stalk. It's not up to me. I'll get fired. I'll pay good money for it. So? The ones deep in the middle are better. We can go if you want. Shall we? - Be careful. - Yes, thank you. - Be careful, Moni. - Yes. Thank you. Is it good? So? They are just like I remembered. Yes. - Did you like it? - It's delicious. - Did you? - Yes. - Did you finish? - Yes. Not yet? Your mom ate like six already. Amanda. Have this one. - Here. - No. I don't like it. She's stubborn. Do you remember... - the first time we came? - Yes. And they scared us. There's a demon in the plantation. Did you know? It's true. For real. He takes the girls that don't behave. Like the bogeyman. Like Amanda. She doesn't behave. I have to go now. It's getting late. I'll be going. Thank you. - What was your name? - Antonio. - Antonio, thank you. - Thank you. Just don't stay too late. At night, it's hard to find the road. Be safe. Goodbye. - Thank you. - Bye. Another one? No, I ate too much. And we can't spoil our appetite for dinner. This is what we're having. Amanda. - The phone. - Mom. What? Amanda. Enjoy the moment, girl. The first time your dad and I came here, I was meeting your Granny for the first time. Your Granny. We were driving a Beetle we had, and it broke down. So we came here. The delicious food your dad makes. Did you like it? Yes. I think they did. Did you like it? - Yes. - Do you want to see the spiders? Why don't you go look for them? Ask Amanda to take you. Please, go with your sister. - Go with her. - Be careful. Come on, Andrea. - I'm coming. - If you see spiders, don't touch them. - Of course not. - No. They left. Are they watching us? - No, right? - Right. What? What? It's nothing. Tell me. It's nothing. Sometimes I miss that adventurous side of you. - It's so late. - Yes. I don't want to leave. - I'm so comfortable. - Yes. But your mom is waiting for us. You know she goes crazy. Yes. - Stop that. - Where are you going? I'll be right back. - Mom, let's go. - Yes, let's go. I know. - As soon as your dad comes... - It's so late. I know! What are we going to do? Are we leaving without your dad? Let's go look for him. I think he got lost. He can't be that far. Put the fire out, please. - Joel! - Dad! He must be waiting for us in the car. Do you have a signal? What time is it? I told you I don't have a signal. - What time is it, Amanda? - It's almost five. - We're not going to find our way out. - No, honey. Don't say that. Listen. We made a wrong turn. But do you hear that? That's the road. We're very close. - Joel! - Dad! - Joel! - Dad! All right, honey. We're here. - Right. - Where is he? I don't know, honey. Maybe he went back for us. Do you have a signal? Please, call your grandmother. - You know what? I'll go look for him. - No, please, Mom, don't go. - I have to go look for him. - Don't go, no. Don't go. - You stay here. - No, Mom. Don't leave me alone. All right. So... Please, give me the phone. OK. So, what happened? We went into the banana grove to grill plantains. Then an employee... a farmer, named Alfredo, took us deeper. My husband went to the bathroom and didn't come back. - And then where did he go? - I don't know, sir. If I knew, I wouldn't be here. Explain something to me. Why did you go into the banana grove? That's private property. Did you know trespassing is a felony? No, I didn't know. But you are not understanding. We were stopped at a checkpoint earlier that day. POLICE Good morning. So we stopped here yesterday. Yes. And we took this path, I think. We walked like 15 minutes. We walked slowly. But then we met the farmers - who took us deeper. - OK. And we set the fire there. So we should go through here. How? Through where? - Here. - Yes, through here, and we walk deep. Joel! Joel! Joel! Joel! Joel! Mr. Joel, we're here! Joel! Where are you? Joel! Joel! Mr. Joel! Are you all right, Mr. Joel? Mr. Joel! Subtitle translation by Victoria Parma
