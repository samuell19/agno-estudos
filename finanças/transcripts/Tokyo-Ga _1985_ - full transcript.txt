Leaving today? Yes, this afternoon. Really? This is our chance to see all our children. That's nice. They must be looking forward to your arrival. Well, I hope so. Keep an eye on our house while we're gone, will you? Of course. Your children have all turned out so well. You're very lucky. I suppose so. And what beautiful weather. Yes, indeed. You'll have a lovely trip. I still can't find it. No? It must be there. Oh, here it is. You found it? Yes, I did. The simple fact is there are few images left. From up here you can see everything's extremely built up. There are few images to be found. One has to dig for them like an archeologist. One has to search through this ravaged landscape to find anything at all. It's often tied up with risk, of course, which I would never shun, but I see so few people today who dare to address our lack of adequate images. We absolutely need images in tune with our civilization, images that resonate with what is deepest within us. We need to go into war zones if need be, or anywhere else it takes us. I'd never complain about the difficulty, even if it meant climbing 25,000 feet into the mountains, to find images that are pure and clear and transparent. There's almost nothing left here. You really have to search. I'd go to Mars or Saturn on the next rocket if I could. NASA's Skylab program, for example, and the space shuttle. They take along biologists and others to test new technologies in space. I wish I could go along with a camera. Because it's no longer easy here on this earth to find that something that gives images their transparency the way you could before. I'd go anywhere for that. You're going to be Ionely with them all gone. It was really so sudden. She was a headstrong woman, but if I had known things would come to this, I'd have been kinder to her while she was alive. Living alone, I feel the days will get very long. Lonely. You will be lonely. THE END
