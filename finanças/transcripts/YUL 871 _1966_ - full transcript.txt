Ladies and gentlemen, we are approaching dorval airport and we should be landing in Montreal in a few minutes. It is now four o'clock local time. Fasten your seatbelts, and no smoking please. All passengers will be required to pass through immigration and customs. Please ensure you have your passport... - What's that mountain over there, in the middle? - Oh, that's mount royal. - Are the girls beautiful in Montreal? It's much larger than I thought. - I was surprised too when I saw it from up here. Montreal's a fascinating city. A freshwater sea port. Over on your left, that's where the seaway starts. Your first trip to Montreal? - Yes, but I have family here. I think. The national film board of Canada presents A film by Jacques godbout Eastern airlines, final call. Flight number 173. Whisperjet service for Washington via Trenton airport and Miami. Passengers are to present themselves to the United States immigration at gate number 16. Eastern airlines, final call. Flight number 173. Whisperjet service to Washington via Trenton airport and Miami. - Passengers are to present... - Hello? I would like to speak to Mr. Jean-Paul nadeau, if I may. You're closed? Air Canada, flight number 66... Destination Ottawa. - But I must see him before Monday. On Monday, I'll be in New York. - We're closed. - Why is that? Is it a holiday? - Yes, it's the English long weekend, sir. - All right then, give me a number where I can reach Mr. Nadeau at his residence? No listen, please listen to me. It's not difficult to understand. I must see Mr. Nadeau today. I've come all the way from Paris to see him today. So what shall I do? Do whatever you like, sir. I'm sorry... - Hello, may I speak to... - There is no service for the number you have dialed. - Not in service? There is no service for the number you have dialed. Yes, yes, I see. There's no service. Large fish. It's a whale? Second word. Bone. Whale bone? Whale hip? Whale bottom? Whale... Ribs? Bone, flesh, oil? Whale muscle? Whale... whale's muscle? First word, whale. Second word, flesh, meat... - Is this yours? Do you live around here? Is this your neighborhood? Are you spying on me now? Tell me, do you happen to know a Mr. Nadeau? No, I thought not. - Is your name francoise? - No. - Claire? - Me? Never. - All right, what is it? - Helene. - Helene. That's very nice. - Thank you, but we already have three helenes in our class. - Would you rather have a number? - I don't think so. I'd be afraid that I'd be number 1 or 13. You look like a 7. The other day, I saw a lady who looked like a 5. She was expecting a baby. - Would you buy me some gum? - If you like. - All right, which one? - Those. How much is it? - Thank you. Thank you. - And now, tell me your name. - Is it a strange name? - I promise I won't laugh. - Good. - I've heard funnier names. - Thank you. Like what? Jean. - Jean? That's funny? - You just don't know my uncle Jean. Want some? Do you know what time it is for me? - You don't want to tell me? - It's midnight. And I was up at four o'clock this morning. I come from a country, you see, where the sun always sets earlier than here. - And does it rise earlier? - Yes. - Well, then it ends up being the same thing. - That's true. - How'd you get here? - On a jet. - You don't know how to land it. - Watch, I'll show you how. - Now, here's Europe, where I'm from. Paris. And we're here, in america. Montreal. It can't be the same time in both places. Wait, I'll explain it another way. - Don't bother. I understand. - Oh? - It's not difficult. - You think? It took me years to understand it. - That's because you didn't understand that the earth turns. Maybe. - Are you meeting someone? - No. - Shouldn't you be home? - No. - It's getting late. - Your mother... - She's working. Every night she works. - What does she do? - I don't know. She dances. - What about your parents? - Are they dead? - I don't think so. - You don't know? - No. - Do you think it's useful to have parents? - That depends. - And your father, where does he live? - Out there, maybe. - I know why you don't want to see your parents. You're afraid you'll be punished. -No I think I'm afraid to find them... To find them much older than I could have imagined. I think that's it. Hello. Are there any messages for me? Thank you. Hello? Hello, Mr. Jean-Paul nadeau? How are you? A very good trip, yes, thank you. Oh no, it was just a little setback. It's only essential that I be on a plane tomorrow morning. Yes, very good. This afternoon. You can meet me at the hotel. Au revoir. May I be of some help, mademoiselle? - A man who's good for something! - A man can be useful. - He can replace the fuses. They can take care of the little odd jobs. Let's see if I can do this. - What sign are you? - Scorpio. - Ah, lovely. I'm gemini. There we go. Voila. That wasn't too painful? - No. No, I'm fine. - Voila. And now, where shall we go? You want a tip? If you're looking for an award, you'll be waiting a long time. - That's cute, what is it? - It's an ookpik. It's a little souvenir animal. Take him, he's yours. - Thank you. I should explain, I'm in from out of town. I'm here for two days, that's all. - Who do you think I am? - The loveliest girl in town. - I can see you're European. Tell me, does it usually work? - What's that? - That pickup line. - Never. It's never worked. - But I must warn you, I have no intention of disrupting my schedule. I'm at your service. Friday, 6:30. Wash the car. Straight ahead. - It wasn't dirty. - It's a matter of principle. - Dirty or not, it must be washed every Friday. - Do you have many principles like that? - Oh, one or two. - My fiancé is another. I think you should meet him, on principle. But tell me, what was it that brought you to Montreal? I can understand going to venice or to Tokyo, but Montreal? - The company I work for is interested in a mass production of heavy machinery. - Locomotives? - No. We make trucks, snowblowers, snow removers... - It pays well? - Pays well? If you want it to. - No, it's an artificial island constructed in a single year. Ten million dollars worth of earth, piled up in the middle of the river. And yet, a world's fair goes by quickly. But you know, here we spend our time excavating, expanding... We tear down, we build up. We live in a sort of perpetual present. Have you ever thought of settling down here? Are you feeling all right? Jet lagged? - No, no, I feel fine. - Do you like flying? - Yes. - But I'd like to learn how to pilot. I like sailing, too. - How large is this section of your factory? - Four square miles. This is what allows us, based on demand, to manufacture trucks ranging in weight from ten to ninety-five tons. No, thanks. I never smoke. - Thank you. Now for the plans, there's detailed documentation? - I can deliver them tonight. - At your hotel? Do you like science fiction? Yes, very much. Especially bradbury. I could never get into it. And not because I find it infantile, after all I read detective stories, but it's all the moralizing... - Earlier, you were asking me if I'd want to live here. - Yes, I know. And you'll ask me, who would leave a major Metropolis for a more provincial city? And you? You've never thought of moving to Europe? - I prefer this old stone refrigerator of a town. Let me tell you, here... In the winter, we dream of Florida. In the summer, we dream of skiing. In Autumn, we're dreaming of spring. I know of no place where people dream as much. - Is this the best one you have? - That depends what you want it for. - I'm looking for a revolver to kill fiancés. Thank you. - Who is that? - A man I met. And please, Antonio, don't say it. I already know. - Where did you meet him? - On the street. - I met him on the street, and don't say "just like a tramp." - Too heavy. - Well, here we have in the showcase a copy of a derringer. It's a small pistol you always see in cowboy films. It's the pistol the ladies carried in their garters. You could wear it in your suspenders, of course, but that's of no importance. I will give you a demonstration. - When you were a little boy, did you ever play cowboys? - Of course. I was Jesse James. - The kids where I lived loved to play Indians. They'd tie me to the stake. - And I always had to rescue her. - But my father said, "it's a school for violence. It's not a game.“ - And he was right, you know. Well, now, that one's a luger. It's from Switzerland or at least it's of Swiss design. It was styled for the Olympics. You could try out for the Olympics with this revolver. And we have this one here, the little Browning .25, which is made in Belgium, but that's of no importance. Mostly for the tourists, the tourists... excuse me, the tourists and the campers. A defensive arm, perhaps. Here we have a superb dagger, if you're interested. - What was that? - That one there? That's a Colt. Superb. The American Colt. Here we have the trap, for loading the bullets. - Would you like to try it? - Yes. - Oh, I have a surprise for you first. I'll give you the holster, as well. Made of real cowhide. Feel it. Alright, I'll get you some bullets. Some bullets, and you can go... Try it out. See you later. I haven't seen you in weeks. - You're lecturing me, now? - I'm not lecturing you, but you could have let me know. Admit it, I didn't say anything. - I'm the one who should be lecturing you. - For ten years now, I've been saying I'd gladly marry you the first Saturday morning... - Hmmm, Saturday... Saturday, you know perfectly well that Saturday's no good. On Saturday, I have my football practice. - We can get married early, and then you can play football. - Good, I love you very much. - I have to close up my shop. If you'll be good enough to give me my bullets? - We never kill anyone on the weekends these days. - When I think I could've killed you just like that... I suddenly go out of my mind... and bang. In the morning, there'd be the headlines: "A foreigner loses his mind and kills a defenseless montrealer." - In any case it's not loaded, so... - He's always saying funny things. - You're keeping that one? $134, plus... - I spent part of my life watching men die, and it's curious how having this in my hand gives me a feeling of security. It's ridiculous, right? I'm getting old. - Mister? Monsieur? Here is your parcel. All ready. - Thank you. - And here is your bill. $168.08. I won't charge you the eight cents. Thank you. Your change. - Will you both be my guests at dinner? - Go ahead, Madeleine. I can't come. I have to go round to the gymnasium for my workout. Well then, I thank you very much. Goodbye. Bye bye, have fun. The province of Quebec? Yes. - It's about three times the size of France. Yes. I don't know if that means anything to you, but it's three times the size of France. Yes. And Canada's seven times as big as France, I think. We learned that when we were in school. It could've changed in all that time, but I don't think it could've shrunk. Well, I don't want to upset you with all these facts. You're parisian, aren't you? - Just came from Paris? - Yes. - Excuse me. - Not at all. - Yeah, I sit here and I chat and I talk and finally I take over your conversation. - Oh, absolutely not. There's a wall right here. Absolutely not, absolutely not. Oh good, I prefer this... It makes it less, less... Excuse me. It's not the first time I've talked through bars. Get it? Thank you. - You like whisky? - Yes. - In Paris, no one really says scotch. They say whisky. - I say both. - Both? - Yes. - Two at a time? That's some trick. Are you parisian, madame? - No, no, Canadian. Well, we won't hold that against you. What do you do? - Well, I'm a representative of a factory that manufactures large trucks - and blowers and snowplows. - Ahhh... - I've seen some very good snowplows here. - Well, we have plenty of snow. Yes. I mean to say... I mean to say we sure can use them. You see? - They're made in France? No, they're made here. That's why I've come here. - Ah, you came to see... - Yes, yes. - You're gonna show us how to plow snow? - No, I came here to learn how. Very parisian of you. - No, no, I came to learn!

And now here's is your good friend... aunt Lucile. Hello, hello, my dear children. It makes me very happy to see that so many of you came out to be a part of my show this morning. Cric, crac, croc. I'm starting today's story, my little friends. It's called "the three warblers." The was once a nice little boy named charlot... - And frontenac? - You don't know your Canadian history. - You know, I was never very good at school. You know what, I looked in the phone book and I think I've found them. Bordeaux street. At least they have the same name. - So, are we going? - Where's that? - You'll see... - You know parents can't get old. - Ah, I see, so they've moved? - Yes, but I don't know where. Just a moment. Francine! - Good morning, madam. - Good morning. - Do you remember last may, the old people we helped to move? Where did they go? - Oh, I don't remember for sure. - Somewhere in the suburbs I think. - Do you remember where they worked? - Oh, yes. Where did the old man work? Do you know? - For the transport commission. - Ah yes, the commission of transport in Montreal. - Where is that? - The woman did housework, but after they moved away she didn't do it anymore. - The commission of transport. - Would you know the address? - It's at the corner of lajeunesse and cremazie. - I'll write it down. - I know where it is. - Let me write it down. - In the north of town. - Cremazie... and lajeunesse. I'm very grateful to you. You've been very kind. - Not at all. - Is this your girl? - No. Thank you very much. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Bon giorno, ah il turista! - Are you winning? - No, they're killing us slowly. - You said you played every Saturday morning, so I came to see. - Basta! Basta! Ah, so you came to see? - Are you in good shape? - No, no, I'm afraid not. - It's my only Saturday in Canada. It's you against who? - The poor Greeks. - Look out! - Excuse me, but Madeleine's not here? - Pardon? - Madeleine. She's not here? - She detests football, you know? - Madeleine doesn't like sports? - No, she prefers trapshooting and the skidoo. - The what? - The skidoo. One minute. The skidoo. The skidoo! It's a machine that travels over the snow. You can go anywhere, anywhere you want. It's very good in the winter. Right now she's in a club for the summer. It's fantastic, you can shoot pigeons, pow pow! - Where is this club, do you know? - It's on the other side of the Jacques-cartier bridge. It's easy to find. - Thanks! - She'd rather shoot pigeons, but they're all such a bunch of snobs in that club! They're all so special. For me, it's not so much that I think they're snobs. But you know she works for lawyers and that leads to expenses. And on top of that, she never listens to me! The other day she said: "I'm buying a car. A lovely new car." I told her: "Buy an alfa!" But no, no, she bought another! - Oh, it's you. Don't make any noise. - Madeleine. - Before you got here, I was doing very well. One pigeon after another. - When I woke up this morning, I looked for you at my side. - That's very sweet. - Why didn't you stay with me? - It's not my style. And you should be glad I'm so considerate. - I feel happy with you. - Then what more do you want? I was trying to be the woman I'd have liked to meet if I had been in your place. - And if you were in my place now, what would you do? - Exactly what you're doing now. - Do you believe in dreams coming true? - You're on a trip, that's all. I beg of you, please go. If we say goodbye now, it'll be less painful. - I don't want to go. - If you have any sense at all, leave me to my pigeons. I hoped you'd be gone by now. Why did you come to Montreal? - You wait for me here. - So? - I think this is the place, but he works at night. He's a guard. - Will you come back again tonight? - Of course. - And then you won't need me anymore. - Why do you say that? - Because you've found them now. - A few days later, my parents crossed the border. They never returned to Romania. When you're fleeing, a child is too heavy to carry. They knew my uncle would come for me. My uncle was a driver for the ambassadors. I've seen a lot of counties. In every country, the service stairs. In Italy, I was 14 years old. They told me: "Your parents are living close to Marseille." While my uncle was busy, I fled towards Marseille. What for? What could I hope to expect from my parents? We have an idea of our parents. We say: "Oh, if only they were there." If they were there, what would that change? I didn't find them in Marseille. At the address I'd been given, they remembered a family, a quiet couple, that left for america one day. The promised land. I didn't want an official investigation. No rubber stamps. Despite a letter from Montreal... It wasn't modesty... It wasn't modesty... I don't know. Fear, maybe. It's cold in here. - It's the air conditioning. - We can turn it off. - In the winter, do you freeze? - No... I always find a man. - I never imagined Canada like this. - What were you expecting? - Indians. Mounted police, chasing the Indians. And also line renaud. Why? Ma cabane au Canada. And what else was there? Once the musée de I'homme, I saw a documentary about Canada. It was about men who walked across town wearing snowshoes. Afterwards, they had a big party. I say it was a big party because there was lots of noise. It was a very good film. And what else? - Why are you looking at me like that? - Radio stations, cta-21 and cta-102. Mean anything to you? - Are they from your country? - No. They're the transmitters of two super civilizations who want to communicate with us. Since 1960, astronomers have heard them. Don't laugh, it's serious. They're transmitting on 900 megacycles, but no one understands them. - It's funny how every man needs to teach a woman something. With you, it's science fiction. With another, it's psychology, and another gastronomy. - Maybe it's the need we have to share. The desire to share something we care about. - And do you think science fiction will replace belief in god? - God only knows. - Did you know we spoke French? - Yes, of course I knew. - Why don't you be nice and dry me off? No, my back! - Do you love me? A little? - No. You please me. Turn off the television. - It bothers you? - No, but I feel like she's staring at me. Someone else, fine. Be she makes me uncomfortable. Tell me, do you think I'll be happy with Antonio? Antonio's always been a good boyfriend. Every time I've needed someone, he's been there. Do you think that's what love is? - I don't know. - Would you believe me if... - Yes, I'd believe anything you told me. - If I were married, I'd never be unfaithful. This is different. It's a love of life. Anyway, with you, it doesn't count. - Thank you. - Oh no, I only meant... You're not from here. - Ah, you have things to do. - Mm-hmm. - Eating oysters. - But they're not in season. - Well, lobster then. - Now? Tonight? - You aren't looking at me. Do you recognize me? It's stupid, it's stupid what I'm asking you. What are we doing? We'll celebrate. We'll hug. What about you, mom? Have you made any friends? Do you have your own house now? How is she? - I'm late. - No, no, we have lots of time. - You're soaking wet! - It's nothing. I mislaid the address. I thought I'd never find the street. - Antonio's gone to get the car. - I'll drive you to the airport. - Madeleine, I have something to say. - Yes? - You'll laugh. - No, go ahead. The important thing is neither of us has been hurt. - Ah, what an awful day. - Come va? - Hello. The Greeks lost? - Oh, the Greeks, the Greeks... - I brought you a little gift. But it was so amusing that I decided to keep it for myself. - It's an instant camera. - Is it loaded? - Yes, it's loaded. Listen, I want you both to pose over here. Madeleine, come here. I want you to stand near the telephone, and you, monsieur, stand beside her. And I'm going to take a little souvenir photo. A little more to your, to your... right. No, I mean to your left. Towards... to your left. To your left. That's it! Don't move. No, no, no, a little but to your... voila. A little more... That's it, yeah. And voila. And now, the show begins. It takes ten seconds before we see a superb finished photo. But, you see, it's taking it out that's so difficult because often you need a pair of pliers. You know, it's... It's very, very, very difficult. Because I have to tell you we're at the eighth, and on the eighth there are always tricks waiting in the corners. As you see, the difficulty is in taking it out. We have to wait ten seconds. It's been four, five, six, seven, eight, nine... And... it's spoiled. So we'll just have to take it again. Stand exactly where you were, and I'll take it again. Good. Don't move at all. I'll just replace the little flash. It's difficult to do it fast... And we're ready! Hop! I feel as if I'm playing goalkeeper! - Madeleine, you're beautiful. - And you, you live far from here. Madeleine, you know, my travels are over. So, what do you want? You. - I'm here. - I love you.
