Stina! Come over here a minute. So, so. Let's calm down a bit! Boiled porridge... Yesterday it was fried porridge. Talk about progress. - Wonder what kind we're getting tomorrow? - Burned porridge, perhaps. - Be grateful for the food you get. - You always have to be grateful. That's right, Anna. Gunnar! In Jesus' name at table have a seat, may our Lord bless the porr.. food we eat. Amen. Rasmus! You're late as always! You know what I think of children who are always late. Go and find your seat. This afternoon there is a couple coming to pick one of you to bring home. How nice it would have been if you could all stay calm, so we wouldn't be ashamed. - Who is coming? - A rich shopkeeper who has a huge shop. Rasmus, the guy is a shopkeep with a store filled with candy. He's childless. - If they would only pick me! - They always pick girls with curly hair. Are there nobody out there who wants a boy with unruly hair? - They only want girls with curls. - I really want to be in a shop. We two could be in charge of the caramel section! Go have a scrub! I don't bother to clean myself. It's no use. - But there are prominent people coming! - Do you think there will inspect my ears? "How clean his ears are! This one we got to have!" - I don't care to clean myself either. - I'll do it any case! Well, you are going to be in head of the caramel department. I'll help you. - You're not mad, are you? - No, but I'll have revenge! Rasmus! I don't have time for you now, but we'll get back to this, trust me! - He'll get a hell of a beating! - Help... Well, well... Your button, Elof! It seems one always have to be ashamed of you. Welcome! - Rasmus! Where have you been? - On the john. (Children laughing) So your name is Rasmus? Hallo! Remember to nod when you greet someone. - Thank you. - Be my guest. What do you say now? Aren't they picking the girls with curly hair? We should find some parents ourselves. I have decided. I will escape tonight. Won't you join me? - Bah! Why would you want to run away? - I'm fed up with this old orphanage. Go then, but I'm not joining. Are you going to sit here till the moss starts to grow on you? - We'll talk about that when you return. - I'm not returning. But who'll be my buddy, then? Gunnar, you'll join me, won't you? Gunnar... Albin, is it true that you have royal blood in you veins? Tell us! Yes, when I was a cute little baby I was kidnapped. When I grow up I'll return to the realm of my rich father. Everybody who have been kind to me will be getting precious gifts. What am I getting? Peter, you're getting a steam engine! Everybody who have been kind to me will receive nice stuff. I'll give you... a tin soldier. Maybe. And what are you thinking of giving me? - Gunnar... - I don't dare to escape. (yawning) Ohhh... Night and day... ...and the worst... ...and the worst are the mornings. Hi kid! Why do you look so scared? Do you think I eat kids? What kind of brat are you? - Rasmus. - Rasmus? - Have you run away from home? - Not from home. Come let me have a look at you. Come on! I told you I don't eat kids. If that was the case I'd have to be darn hungry. Have you run away too, mister? Don't "mister" me - my name is Oscar. The Celestial Hobo and God's own cuckoo, that's who I am. And I certainly have run away from home. - How come you are God's own cuckoo? - Well, somebody has to be. Our good Lord must have wanted there to be hobos, since he created them. I guess you only eat gruel with raisins for breakfast? - The ordinary grub isn't for you? - Yes please, if Oscar has enough for two. Certainly. Not all farm ladies are petty. The one who gave me this must have know that I was meeting you. Do you always bring along your accordion when you are loafing? I'd starve without it. I play for my living, you see. (Sings) Sad things happened once upon a time... And then the women weep and I get some pocket change. I too want to be a celestial hobo and stroll around singing. Kids like you shouldn't be hobos, they should be at home with mom and dad. I don't have a mom and dad. I'm on the look for some. - For what? - Somebody who wants me. Maybe you'll find someone. Keep looking. Bye, kid. (Whistles) Oscar, can't I join you on the bum? I can't have a kid to join me! - Please Oscar! - No, no... - Where do you come from? - The orphanage... Vasterhaga. I won't go back. Why did you run away, then? Had you done something wrong? - Maybe you had stolen something? - Yes... Well, so you're of that sort! If you steal when you're on the bum it's all over. Then the police are all over you before you have the time to sneeze. Bye, bye! - What was it that you stole? - A rusk! A rusk! What a bandit! Can't I be a cuckoo like you? Methinks yes, said the guy with his head under his arm. (Sings) I am so glad today strolling around, feeling so gay Could easily kiss twenty girls without loosing my breath How madly in love I am today C'mon girl, why don't we roll in the hay I'll carry you with me soon we will only be seen by the moon - How beautiful! To have a mother like that! - Well yes, that would be something! (Sings) On a little breach by a lonely beach a little bird once sang many a fine tune And I listened to the musical woo And he sang once more... Here you are. Thank you, mam! Thank you, thank you! This mark is a sign to other hobos that are passing later. It means "Nothing to get here". (Sings) Now it's summer, it's sun The cows have left some dung The old hag is having some fun Stuff her mouth with cookies Come here, little chick, come to me And I will throw some cow dung on thee Come and start up the chase When you have wiped the dung off you face No money, only some lousy cookies. Not much of a dinner. I wish that we would find someone rich and beautiful. - I hope you find that soon. - You want to get rid of me, right? (Motor) Liander, give that boy some change. You should be kind with the poor. - I don't have any small change. - Well, next time, then! Next time will be better, said the guy who soiled himself. Brrr! Close the door! There is an old shirt there. Take that. Brrr! And I am also starving. Well, maybe you should simply have stayed at the orphanage! What business did you have to do out on the road? - You want to ditch me, don't you? - If I do I'll let you know. Make sure that the fire doesn't go out. Kids like you shouldn't be on the bum! - Where are you heading? - To America! To get get some peace and rest, but after a while I'll be back! - Have you stolen them? - Stolen... No... You said that the police would be on your back before you can sneeze... Did I? How wise I am. But I can't let a kid starve because of that, or because it pleases the sheriff. (plays the harmonica) (Sings) Stupid little Manne he cooked some paste He told Manne's mother the whole family should taste The boy cooked paste in plenty It was enough for more than twenty Said the mother to Manne Who was to cook some paste - Do you want one? - Beautiful music... ...fill me more than eggs do. (Sings) Then there was little Stine No it wasn't It was little... Saga She was putting Bart to bed But Saga wasn't smart Cause Bart he let a fart You must expect that children will let a fart when put to bed Said the mother to Sara who was putting Bart to bed. I can't eat more than two eggs. - Are you sure? - Yes. Won't you take this one? (Laughs) No, kids like you shouldn't be on the bum. (Sings) Here comes a hobo man Whose hat is aslant Here comes a hobo man Whose hat is aslant And on this hobo's side There is a little ant And on this hobo's side There is a little ant This little hobo just joined in on the chant - Come! - Thanks for the ride! Shall we buy something? Do you like caramels? Everybody likes caramels, but I don't have any money. Have I travelled along with a millionaire without knowing? May I sit with you? Hi. Well, let's see which one we should pick. You can take them all. I want you to. No, one should always share. One of them will do. Oscar, I think we should save those other caramels. Exactly, challenges may occur in life- - when it is good to have a caramel to comfort oneself with. Oscar! How much you get to see when you are on the bum. Poor devils who have to march all day. Let's cheer them up. (Sings) At Eksjo the girls dance all night And all the guys pick up a fight At Hultsfred beach the dames will tease Every soldier who is on his knees (Soldiers sing) Adulating adelideli Adelittan adelideli Aderallalla, aderallalla Adelittan adelidela Listen to this city song I keep on singing all night long It sound just like a sharpened knife Let's dance with the butcher's wife Adelittan adelideli Adelittan adelideli Aderallalla, aderallalla Adelittan adelidela Good day, mam. You wouldn't happen to have a little bite for me and my hobo pal? Paradise-Oscar again... What are you doing again here? - You got a slice of meat from me last time. - Well yes, but I survived... Who is this little guy? It's a heathen child that I have taken care of. We are searching for a Christian home for him. Madame couldn't use a little heathen, could she? Heathen yourself. Chop some wood, and I'll get you something to eat. Chop wood... Couldn't I rather play you a tune? Thanks, but I'll do fine without the tune. Chop wood... Can we see the menu before we accept? Out to the wood stack and no loitering! Oh boy, there have been plenty of hobos chopping here before me. I come in a bad mood when I approach a wood stack. Oscar, you are really a lazy guy. It's only that I am content with very little - when it comes to working. - Has nobody given you a proper job? - Yes, it has occurred. But for the most part people are kind to me. When I work, I really work so hard that it's a sin. I chop so that the logs fill the air! People keep a distance. I have to put up a sign: "Warning: Logs are flying. " So nobody can say that I don't know how to work. The only thing is that I make too modest demands when I work. People have this strange idea that one should always work. I don't understand any of that. Me neither when I was at Vasterhaga. No, but try to understand now. Here is the axe! Go on! Work hard! Like I always do! (Sings) Lazy little Ottar he was chopping wood But instead he chopped a car as fast as he only could Little child who chopped so long What is this wood you bring along? Said the mother to Ottar Who was cutting wood Oh... Tiresome stuff, mam. But now you should have wood for four or five years. Scram! Ah, herrings and warm potatoes, that's the stuff. Ham is good. Oh, yes, ham is also great, poppy. - He's too young to be on the bum. - But it shan't last long. As a matter of fact he is going to see his mother and father. In Minnesota. In Northern America. There they live as millionaires. Of course, the lady knows all about that. And in Minnesota, they have plenty of ham. Ham is good. Oscar. When will you let me know? Let you know what? - What? - That I'll have to leave you. I can't just leave you when I don't know if you have someone to live with. What are you laughing at? I dreamt that I sat in a flat with a cat. "I dreamt that I sat in a flat with a cat. " Are you making songs? Do you know what he ate? He ate only herring and potatoes. - Cats don't eat herrings and potatoes! - Well, my cat did. (Sings) I dreamt that I had... (plays the harmonica) (Sings) I dreamt that I sat in a flat with a cat. That.. And he only ate herrings and potatoes! That's almost a song. Yes, it's a song. Listen... (plays the accordion) (Sings) I dreamt that I sat In a flat with a cat. And he only ate potatoes and herring! Believe it if you will That puss sure had a thrill Eating potatoes and herring. - Ah, I like you so much, Oscar! - And you sing really well. (Sings) I dreamt that I sat In a flat with a cat. And he wagged his tail in the dance Well, believe it or not but these kittens are hot when it comes to doing romance I dreamt that I sat in a flat with a cat. Oh, how it hissed when I rose Believe it or not but it hurt me a lot when that cat bit off my nose. (Song and music) - So much money! - That's the workers' salaries. Look how she counts, that pretty thing. I like money, but I never had any myself. - Me neither. Some people would do anything for money. Don't end up like that! But if it isn't Paradise-Oscar?! Are you out strolling again? - Got yourself kids on your old days? - Sort of! Say hello, Rasmus. That's Sju-Attan. And that's Licesnatcher over there. And this is Summer-Jocke and Lill-Parke. - This one is unknown to me. - Rosasco Seramonsky. Wanders the face of the earth and have seen better days. Your humble servant. - What's it called? - Pretty Polly. She has seen better days too. But she can still pick a fortune ticket for you, my friend. Here you are. Your servant. Let's see if you are lucky or not. "Follow your path without fear. " "You will meet challenges, but they will only be temporary. " "Your path will be long with many gates blocking the way"... ..."you will have to open them before you can reach the goal"... ..."that Destiny has chosen for you. " "... many gates blocking the way" Doesn't it say that I'll get that cat I have been dreaming of? Yes, here it says: "And you'll meet a cat on your path" Are you happy? Go and rest over there. - I have to go out first. - Yes, let's go and piss both of us. Good night... dummies! See that? There is something rotten going on. What shall we do, Oscar? - Good lord! - Get the police! Good, we won't get mixed into this. When you're a bum, you have to keep at a mile's distance from the law. Let's get out of here in a jiffy! Yes, Andersson! There is one! You over there! - What? What is it? - You'll know later. - Don't move! - Come here! - Yes, but won't you tell me why. - All tramps are to be interrogated. Here I lay sleeping innocently like a bride, and then you come busting in... ...and wake me up like this. - Is this the way to treat people? - Quiet, or you get cuffed. - Are you going to town? Can I come with? - Sure. - Hey, you. - Hey. - Do you know where the sheriff lives? - I'll show you. - The king is coming today. - To see the sheriff? - To town, to open the railway. - The real king? Do I look like two masked men to you? Tramps always get blamed for everything! - What did you do Thursday - I ate peaches and ham. That's all? I mean, is that all you did Thursday? I certainly didn't dress up as two masked guys and steal money. I never stole a cent, the sheriff can drink poison to that. Well, maybe not drink it, but he can jump up and sit on it. We'll let Paradise-Oscar go, then. For this time. Yes, I guess it's a mitigating circumstance- - that I'm as innocent as a bride. We'll let's say goodbye for this time. Excuse me! The gentleman forgot his hat! That left you speechless, right? And I who thought that you had started tramping for yourself. No, I'm not that petty. Want a caramel? "What did Oscar do on Thursday?" Go to hell! It's a challenge like it was described in the fortune ticket. - The hunger is setting in. - Go steal some eggs, then! Now I'm gonna boil my pal! For ten minutes! Here you see, here there is money for a tramp- - cause there is no woman more generous than Mrs. Hedberg. (Sings) Why should people fuss and fight Why should we all get fried Why should people suffer all night Just to please others' pride Here you are. Mrs. Hedberg isn't well today. A cent... Where are you heading, miss? I'm going to see the king. But go ahead and play. I usually get 10 cents from Mrs. Hedberg. The girl must have taken the rest. Let's play anyway to cheer her up. (Sings) The man said to his old lady Won't you put a patch on my bum, on my bum put a patch on my bum Have you heard the terrible news It's all true The king of America just got shot, shot to pieces. Tjolahopp tjang tjong faderalla la... - Rasmus! - When the king of America... There's the little gate boy again. Now you can give him a piece, Liander. We have money now. You, come over here! It pays off to be polite and open the gate for prominent people. Is all this for me? Thank you so much. Promise me to be hard-working and behave. And to be honest and clean. That way you'll get far. As far as him, maybe. Oh, king Rasmus the first... The train is coming! (song) Deep from the heart of the Swedish people a simple and unified song arises to reach the king Be faithful to him and his kin Make the crown easy on his head And put all your faith on him You, peace loving people Your majesty, ladies and gentlemen! Oscar, that's Gunnar and the whole gang from Vasterhaga! ...to the unveiling of another link- - of the band of steel that is tying our country together. Where the iron horse makes it's way- - there is a fruitful place for industry... - Licesnatcher, are you here too? - I have been questioned by the police. ...between city and country, from mountain to mountain... Hi! ...from coast to coast... Did you say that we were in Sando that Thursday night? Well, yes, in passing. Since I had spent the whole afternoon there myself. - I couldn't deny it. - You didn't say that I was there too? - I may have mentioned it in passing. - Seems you mentioned a lot. What was I to do? Rasmus! Let's go. Licesnatcher talks too much. Get some food Gunnar! Gunnar! Bye! Four times cheers for king Gustav V! Long may he live! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! (singing national anthem) Thou ancient, thou freeborn, thou mountainous North, In beauty and peace our hearts beguiling... The girl didn't see it, because she wanted to see the king. - What times we live in. - Poor Mrs. Hedberg. - Her beautiful diamond necklace... - What has happened? - Mrs. Hedberg was robbed! - She is still unconscious from the shock. It was a tramp, and a little boy he had with him! (play the harmonica) (Sings) Mondays I don't do a thing, do a thing, do a thing Tuesdays I see what the day will bring, day will bring, day will bring Wednesdays I stroll under skies Thursdays I philosophize... Yes, now the challenges that you are always talking about start. - Now I have to hide for the rest of my life. - But, Oscar... Yes, now that the sheriff knows that I was in Sando on Thursday. He thinks that a tramp with an accordion has scared Mrs. Hedberg stiff. And stolen her diamond necklace. If she doesn't wake up I'm done for! But you are as innocent as a bride! The Celestial Hobo and God's own cuckoo, but still I'm getting arrested. (Sings) Fridays I do as I please Saturday is weekend ease No, it's really tightening up. They can search till they get cross- eyed. They'll never find us here. Where have all the people who used to live here gone? I guess they have gone to America every one of them. - Didn't they want to stay any longer? - It became too miserable out here. But they had a great place to bathe. I reckon there is nothing similar in America. They could bathe in the clearest waters in all of Minnesota- - if they wanted to bathe, that is. (plays the harmonica) The clearest waters in all of Minnesota... I'd like to see that! I say! You cleaned this place up! I should clean my cloves before I enter. Does the gentleman want his eiderdown here or elsewhere? - Put it in the kitchen, in the bed. - In the kitchen, in the bed it is! It's really become stylish here. Nice bed, Rasmus! (burps) Oskar, imagine you were my dad and we lived together in a house. Would have been grand! A tramp as a dad! Would have been fine -fine as ham, no? (laughs) Of course. Gosh, I'm really stuffed! (sings) Wherever I go, wherever I turn make sure that you're still my friend Your days of youth will soon be gone Your days of youth will soon be gone They'll never ever They'll never ever come again No, they'll never ever come back again. No, my dad is no tramp. He has a shop with hot dogs and candy. My father is rich, but apart from that he is like Oscar. Good night. He wraps the red silk carpet over me, because mother is in Minnesota- - and bathes in the clearest waters there and writes in her letters: "Soon I'm returning home and I'm bringing along gifts to you all. " - Oscar, do you think there are ghost here? - Ha! Ha! If there are, God's own cuckoo will throw them in the lake. (somebody whistles) - Oscar, do you hear? - Yes... How great it is to have lots of money! Your whole body sings, and even your appendix crumbles. - Can't we just take it all and leave? - No, we're staying at the hotel... ...till the whole affair calms down, looking as innocent as little lambs. Put the necklace here. Finally I will be able to live like the gentleman I am! Champagne, Russian caviar, dames! Madman! I will simply buy house in Tidaholm, that way I know what I am. In Tidaholm! Yes, that way you know what you have... Hilding Lif doesn't settle for petty crap. He must have... the whole shit. Help, I'm afraid. - Wow...! - That's a way to phrase it. Tomorrow we'll bring it all to the police, right? Mrs. Hedberg's necklace! No, we'll do it with cunning, the lady said, and killed the lice with her toes. We'll hide it all somewhere safe and write to the sheriff to tell- - where he can pick it up. Newly picked flowers... in a bottle... on a box... Now you look like king Solomon in person! Yes, you have to be beautiful a time or two in life too! I want you to look like king Solomon. You need to look more handsome. (door opens) Newly picked flowers in a bottle on a box! Just like I said! - It's gone. - Search everywhere. They can't have left the house! Liander! Search everywhere! Where are you? Look in the attic! - Well? - The tramp and the kid! He's wearing the necklace! Go, Rasmus! Run! Quick! Get the kid, he's running for help! Ah! Lif!.Lif!. Come and let me out! Rasmus! Rasmus! Here I am! - Where is he? - He takes a nap! Where is the other one? - I locked him up in the potato cellar. - King of Giants! Give me the firearm! I threw it in the lake. Was that stupid? No, it was wise, we are no great shots. Come! I can't, I have run several miles. Little boy. Jump up here! We have to leave, you see. The faster, the better. It's a sad thing, you tramps who have to roam around all the time. - And they don't get into heaven. - Little-Sara has gotten that all wrong. She thinks that she will get into heaven because she sits on her behind all day. - That can turn out wrong as well. - We'll see how it ends. He wants some coffee as well? And a sandwich. But without butter, that will have to wait. Little-Sara is good and will get into heaven. Give this letter to the sheriff. It's extremely urgent. But I won't talk to him. I'll simply hand him the letter and leave- - or he'll start nagging and insist that I be moved to the alms house. - Just give him the letter. - I don't want to. But I'll do it anyway. The priest says we should be kind to the poor. And Oscar is poor. - What did you write to the sheriff? - That I am innocent as a bride... ...and that the crooks stay at the hotel and where I have hidden the goods. - Where did you hide it? - A secret place. I don't want the King of Giants to be mixed into this nasty business. Look, Oscar! Look! They are all from Vasterhaga! The one running there is Gunnar. I have to talk to him. I'll stay and guard the clothes. If there are someone who would want those old rugs... Gunnar! Rasmus! - Darn, how I have missed you! - And I've been thinking about you every day. - The Hag isn't here? - She's over there. - Have you found some folks to stay with? - Sort of... I don't know how it will turn out. I have experienced lots of things lately. Here at Vasterhaga things are still the same. We work till we turn blue. (blow the whistle) Get up now! Bye, Rasmus. To think that we may never see each other again. We must. After all I have never had another friend like you. I said now! Be quick! Rasmus! Come here now. We have things to talk about that are not at all pleasant! Lisa, get Rasmus! Rasmus! (Hurrahs) (laughs) We sharpen knives and scissors! Step up! Step up! - Can you sharpen my scissors? - Sure thing! It will be sharper than you can imagine. Who wants to see the future? Who wants to know of joys to come? Come buy a fortune ticket! Only ten cents! The path of life can be winding... (Sings) First we go rambling on the road then we go behind the bush... But first we go up on the road Then we go behind the bush Tralalla Hey the way It rips and tears Hey the way It rips and tears... Take his gun! I who am so easily scared that I hide when the cat arches its back? Little-Sara! The letter to the sheriff! The letter! Oscar! I want to talk to the sheriff! Do you hear? He's at a party, he has no time for you. He's at a party and here am I, innocent as a bride! Liar! You were in Sando and in Mrs. Hedberg's house. You should be locked up. I want to call you a fool, but I guess there is a law against that too. -Certainly. I call you constable, but I really mean fool! - Put him in the cell. - What about the boy? We'll have to get him back to Vasterhaga. (blows the whistle) - What odd farmers! - I ended up with nothing. Where did you run from? Do you see what I see? The little punk. Then the tramp must be near. When you see this sign you know there is food to get. And this... It means that there is money around. And if you see a sign like this on a door or at a gate... What does it mean? - Angry dogs and violent men. - You learn as quickly as a fox! - Better be careful with dogs and brutes. - Be good and get us some water. (sings) Wherever I go wherever I turn make sure that you're still my friend Wherever I go wherever I turn make sure that you're still my friend Your days of youth will soon be gone Your days of youth will soon be gone They'll never ever They'll never ever come again - Where is the tramp? - The sheriff's got Oscar. - Then he'll blame us. - Now is the time to keep our heads cool. Answer quick. Did Oscar have the money when the cops got him? No, he's hidden them somewhere secret, but I don't know where. What would you say if we got Oscar out of jail for you? - That would be kind of you. - Well, we are kind guys! If they get the money they'll help you escape. You can't do business with crooks, didn't you know, my boy. But we could go loafing. I have nobody else. Damn sheriff who is at a party! Berggren! Andersson! I want to speak to the sheriff! Get the sheriff here! (motor starts) (motor stops) - Have they treated you badly? - Yes... The police will only have them- selves to blame if I escape. They don't believe me, so I might just as well go. Bring them here. (whistles) Oscar... - Yes, Oscar! The letter! - Too late! - But I delivered it. - Too late, Little-Sara. So, you thought Hilding Lif would be tricked by a simple tramp?! - So the money is hidden here. - No... Where is it then? Tell us! Fish or fowl or in between? Where is it? I think... I think I have forgotten... - You have yourself to blame! - No, don't shoot! Then the sheriff also has himself to blame! Drop your guns! I object! You should... The tramp is the... Watch the shirt cuffs if you are putting those on me! Sheriff, I am as innocent as a bride If you have more letters I could deliver them. One should pity those who are poor and won't get into heaven. I am truly sorry I had the slightest suspicion and admit my mistake. Now you see, said the blind man while he cut off his eye lids! - It's good everything got solved. - I gave Mrs. Hedberg the necklace. She told me how happy she was. - Glad she is well! And I am free to go? - A moment. Andersson! We must get transport for the kid to Vasterhaga. Don't let them take me away! I want to be with you! - Kids like you shouldn't be loafing. - Only till I find somebody who wants me. If there are anyone in the world who will keep me. I have opened sixteen gates on my path of life. I counted all. - There are many gates on this path. - How do you know? Walked it already? Many times. Here comes Nilsson from Rocky Farm. A rich farmer - with a big farm. What a polite little gate opener. And there is Oscar too. So you are back in these parts? Will you join me for some food at my place? What do you say, Rasmus? Of course! He must be the smallest tramp to have sat in my kitchen. Will you get the malt beer, Lise? - You don't like it at Vasterhaga? - I don't want to be there. Nope, and now he is out looking for a mom and dad. We have been thinking of getting a foster child, but never got around to it. No, we but never got around to it. - You want a girl of course? - No, a boy. We have nobody to leave the farm to and no kids of our own... Yes... we were thinking of getting a boy. - With curly hair... - Yes in fact. How did you know? To think of it I always imagined him with curly hair. But I guess we could go for a boy with different hair too. If I were you I'd go for the King of Giants with unruly hair! - Would you like that, Rasmus? - Stay here a while... ...and we'll see how we get along. This is a nice farm, Rasmus. - You'll be fine here. - Yeah. But there is no cat here like the fortune ticket said it would be. You can't get all you want in life, you know. I guess I have to say goodbye. I'll sleep in the barn and will be on my way early in the morning Thanks for letting me join you loafing, Oscar. What a nice little ruffian you are with your unruly and scruffy hair. - Good night, King of Giants! - Good night. (knocks) Come in. - Good morning, Rasmus. - Good morning. Have you slept well? Have a seat. Eat all you want. Here is sausage, eggs, porridge and bread. Is there anything wrong? - What? - I'd rather be with Oscar. I see. Why would you rather be with him? I've gotten used to Oscar. I'd rather be with him. Don't be sad. We'll see if there is another boy at Vasterhaga for us. Take Gunnar! He's best. He's got wiry hair, but otherwise he's great. I guess we'll have to take a trip to have a look at him. Pick him. He's good! He's the best! Oscar! Oscar! Rasmus! Rasmus! Rasmus! Oscar must have left, you see. If you hurry down the hill you may catch him. Bye. Down pick a girl with curly hair! Pick Gunnar! He's the best! Gunnar! Oskar! Oskar! Hi! What now? Where are you heading? I want to be with you, Oscar. Please let me be with you. So you want to let go of a farm with horses and cows - the whole lot? But Oscar, why can't you be my dad? You can't have a tramp as father. I can, if he's like you. You want someone rich and handsome. - I think you're quite handsome. - Oh yes... handsome as a bride! I don't care if you're not rich. I want to stay with you, Oscar. (laughs) (sings) - A fat boy called little Phil - He was carrying some hay - But Phil soon lost his will - He had worked half the day - Poor kid who is carrying hay - You are far too slow today - Said the mother to fat Phil - Who was carrying some hay Know what? When you are on the loaf you own everything you see. You have traded nothing. Everything is ours! Wanting to go strolling is no mystery then. - The houses aren't ours? - We can't care about that. You have to have some house. One like that one. I decide that that house is for us. And let's decide that cat is for me - like in the fortune ticket! Shall we sing here? No. We'll sing as little as possible... right now. - But here tramps can both eat and sleep. - Perhaps... Martina... Martina! Darling... So you finally show up? Who have you brought along? I had a son since last time. He's so small you barely notice him. Rasmus is the name. How have you been while I was away, little Martina? What du you think? The gate is falling off, the lid for the well is broken- - the rain is getting into the chamber, but apart from that all is well. - Are you very mad with me, Martina? - Yes I am. But oh so glad I am to have you back! - Oscar! - Martina darling! You're right little sweetheart aren't you! He's a strange one, he is. He'd rather have a tramp for father than Nilsson at Rocky Farm. This was a bit sudden. But that's how it is with everything you do. - Do you want to stay here with us? - Does Martina want a boy with unruly hair? One with unruly and scruffy hair or none at all! When you're not mad you're an angel, Martina. - Martina... Are they all mine? - Yes. - Don't you want any of them? - No, I only want you. What luck I've had. Just like in the fortune ticket. Now it's working time! The gate, the well, the roof... Do you love me, Martina? Yes, that's what I thought. What a douche. A lazybones, that's what he is. Not always. Sometimes he works like a madman, he told me himself. - He sure knows how to talk. - Yes, and I hear real well too. Do you love me Martine, now that I fix your roof? Tell me! Yes! But I'm praying God to replace your tramp blood with some crofter blood! But Oscar is God's own cuckoo and can't be a farmer all the time. - I guess not. - Exactly. And still he struggles for his wife and his little boy. Wow, that was hard work. A real exertion. Well, better take it a bit easy in the start. Let's go down to the lake and cool down a bit. Come on, King of Giants! What hard work! Oscar, you must go to Rocky Farm tomorrow and drive some hay. Didn't Nilsson tell you? - Well, well. You have to struggle. But one day at the time. But next spring, Rasmus, we'll take another trip, you and I. (sings) Watch the tramp strolling down the road Watch the tramp, God?s little guy As soon as spring has come He has to pack and say goodbye Why do I have to keep on going? There are other things I could try So why do I keep on tracking Maybe I'll end up in Shanghai I want to be free as a bird Free as a bird And then I feel something calling me Deep in my vagabond soul I want to be free as a bird Free as a bird And then I feel something calling me Deep in my vagabond soul Watch the tramp strolling down the road Watch the tramp, God?s little guy As soon as spring has come He has to pack and say goodbye He keeps walking that endless length He has a burning and restless soul When the sun burns he gets mad And that's where he gets his strength He wants to be free as a bird Free as a bird And then he feels something calling him Deep in his vagabond soul He wants to be free as a bird Free as a bird And then he feels something calling him Deep in his vagabond soul
