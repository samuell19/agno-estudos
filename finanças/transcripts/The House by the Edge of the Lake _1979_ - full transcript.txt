What's happening, Mum? -I can't get out of here. Everything's okay. Come on, give me your hand. Be good and wait there. I'll come back for you. No, that's not fair... You forced me off the road, you could've hurt me... It's not right, you were a thug, a bastard. Excuse me, how do I get to the house by the lake? Go down there, then take a left... Keep going straight, there's only one road. Thanks very much. -It's nothing. You're not from around here, are you? Why do you want to go to the lake? I might be going somewhere else. -No, this road only goes to the lake. But no one ever goes there. Do you believe in ghosts? I don't. No, me neither. Listen, you know you should be more careful... It's dangerous walking on the road. -Why? I can't even see. The others should be more careful. Do you like it? I made it... You can have it if you want? -But her head is missing. Why does that matter? Everyone of us has something missing. I didn't mean to... -Then goodbye, I'm busy now. Did you see? Who knows why she didn't want to say she was going to the lake? "How many times have I told you not to play indoors." "Look, your shoes are all dirty and look at the state of the floor..." "Go back to your room." "Look at the state of you." "No, don't go in your mother's room. You know she doesn't want you to." "No, I said don't go in." Who's there? Is someone there? Is anyone home? What happened to my room? The truth is... Your father asked us to burn everything, absolutely everything... Clothes, furniture... We didn't know if you were ever coming back. To tell you the truth, we were convinced you'd never come back... Isn't that right, Mario? -It's true... No one has ever set foot in here since the death of your mother... With one exception... -Be quiet! Can't you keep your mouth shut? If that's the case, it's not a problem... I can sleep in mother's room while I'm here... Her room is still furnished. -Yes, your mother's room is... You father never knew that we left it as it was... The only room in the house. But, you know... ...there's no light in there. What about at night? I only need two candles. Call an electrician tomorrow. But it's a simple job, I can take care of it. Look, even the bath doesn't work. -Bon appetit. Listen, but you... Are you thinking of living here? -Why are you asking me this, Martha? You seem upset. No, quite the opposite, however... -Don't worry, I won't be staying long... I just need to finish my research, then I'm going back to Italy. But there are only old ruins around here. That's exactly what I want to see. I'm interested in ghosts... ...and witches, understand? Look, Marta. Here as well. These toads are everywhere. Are you scared? No, it just startled me. I must be tired. Marta... What were you doing behind the door? I was coming here... I wanted to know if you needed anything? No, thank you. Goodnight. This girl isn't going to do us any favours, I can feel it. Don't talk rubbish. She can't stay here, she has to go. Why? This is her home. Do you hear it? Calm down. I know... I know you're hiding, like always... But you must leave her alone, understood? You must leave her in peace. Lillian, what are you doing? Have you gone crazy? For the love of God, come away from there... Do you hear me? -Why are you shouting? Get away from there, do you realise what you're doing? Please, get away. Why do you want to upset me? Okay, I'm coming. -Hurry... Hurry, my little one. This lake is cursed, Lillian. Do you know what the villagers say? Come on, get out. -Why all the fuss? A cursed lake, the villagers... You're exaggerating. I was only going around in a boat. Hey guys, look who I've brought with me... Do you remember? The masked man... Here she is, Lillian Batro, from the Baden family... She's twenty years old... She came back to Loville to do some research for her thesis... A difficult subject; Medieval History. -Hi, guys. Good morning. Well? Have you still got in for me because of the other day? Watch out, guys. She's a tough one... ...and above all a pain in the ass. (?) , dear? It depends. -On what? Time? Life? Or destiny? -On you, handsome. She's very beautiful, isn't she? It's my auntie. Do you believe in witches? I don't. She wasn't a witch. In the village they say she was... They call her the beautifiul witch. -But Kira died in her bed. Laura. Come with me, we need to finish the doll house. We need to take all this stuff to the village, the fair starts in four days. I know. I'll take care of it. Here, this is my dolly. Keep it in view or it might get offended. As you wish, mademoiselle. Goodbye, sugar. Keep it in view, will you remember? Don't worry, Laura. We'll put her in the front row. Who is he? -An old timer, a painter... A madman. I don't know, you decide. Have you decided? Whiskey or Coca-Cola? Look. Look who's here, the little monkey. I thought to myself, I'll bring her inside and have nice seance... Come on, smile. Don't be afraid, your strong boyfriend is here. Lillian is next door, shall we go to the cemetary tonight? It might be fun but I'm crapping my pants. I brought some toilet paper. Are you sure it's a good idea? -You haven't understood a damned thing... Don't you ever get the shivers? Just ask our guests, tell him, Lillian. The fear. The gateway to the beyond... Metempsychosis. -Metem... What? Metempsychosis. You really haven't seen any horror films. Be quiet. Respect the dead. The last time you brought a radio it broke. Didn't it belong to those whores we took here? Yes, but the problem is they wanted the money for a new one. But what does the radio have to do with it? Okay, guys. Let's split up. Who's coming with me? -Me! Come on, guys. Don't be afraid. Lillian. They called her Kyra. Have you heard about her? -Sure... Everyone around here knows about her. Did they want to burn her for being a witch? She wasn't a witch. -How do you know? She was one of my ancestors. Kyra. Kyra. Kyra. Yes, Lillith. I'm with you... ...and I will be with her. -No, not with her. Not with her. -It's written, Lillith. Not with her. Lillian. Lillian, what's wrong? Lillian. Lillian, wake up. Lillian... Wake up. I've got nothing to do with it. Why are you laughing? What's so funny? Julienne is dead. She killed him. What did she say? Who is she? Ah! The little monkey. She's been getting a lot worse lately. She was talking about Julien. -She's crazy. What did I say? Where did she go? She went over there. Something must have happened. Shall we call in the photographers as well? Would you all like seats? Make yourselves comfortable... Go back home. Everyone go home. So... Why did you come here? Seeing as you don't know anything. However, I'm going to ask you some questions.... I'm the Inspector and I ask the questions... How come you don't know anything if you were there? Yes, but we left earlier. We went to the cemetary... -Yes, we all went together... Just to do something. But we left them by themselves... Him and her. -Her? Who? Lillian. Lillian Bader. You prepare it like tea... It's a mixture of herbs. It even tastes the same. But it isn't tea. It looks like it but it isn't. Like many other things. It seems like it in some way, but instead... That kid's death, for example... It seems like an accident, a normal procedure... He lost control and... But it might also be suicide. What do you think? But why? Why? I was also with him... But I didn't notice anything strange. I mean to say he seemed normal. Untill... Untill I fainted. -You fainted? Who knows what he thought? He must have been scared... Thinking you were dead. The smaller the place, the bigger the problems. Morality... Religion... Superstition... Above all, superstition. It still has a place around here. They're all dead. Dead. All dead. Look here... It's a curse. Dead. The mark of destiny, they're all dead. It's her, the daughter of the lady of the lake. When her mother died (?) What do you know about the lady of the lake? Do you still remember her? Lillian, is that you? -Yes, but how did you get here? Who brought you here? -My friend, the painter... He's not here now. He doesn't want anyone to see him. Listen, who taught you this song? -My friend taught me... He knows so many things. "There's a witch down there in the lake..." You want to know what this song is about... It's happened many years ago... Actually, centuries ago... This is why you came back, right? -And you know? Perhaps, but you'll have to find out by yourself. You'll only find part of what you're looking for in books. Where? -In the Boscara parish... ...you'll find Kyra's death certificate. She was beautiful, very beautiful... In the archives of the Besalu cathedral you'll find other details... Useful information. -Who are you? I'm not part of your memories. -But I'm part of yours. That's my business. Nuns don't use motorbikes to avoid succumbing to temptation. Where is this written? 'Sex in Church', chapter four; 'Orgasms on motorbikes'... You should read it. It's very interesting, I wrote it... But there are many other things to learn... Are you curious? -Yes. Is there a library here? -Yes, but it's closed now. I can come back later. -No, I'm here... I used this library for months for my books... I can come and go as I please. You know something? They (?) everything... Including their dirty laundry. Do you want to have a look? It's a bit of a mess but what can we do? If us writers don't settle into our workplace. Have you ever seen a writer at work? I haven't. Here we go. Kyra, she was an important woman... One of the few people who managed to rip off the church... Who knows what the priests would've done to have her executed? May I take it? I want to make a photocopy. -Sure. You're the daughter of the lady of the lake, isn't that right? Does this have something to do with sex in church? I heard about the incident... Certain facts make a lot of noise in a small village like this... I was very close to that guy, he was my cousin. Is your name Villamor as well? -No, not me. But my mother is. That's my grandmother. No... No, she's not my grandmother... She's my great grandmother... Excuse me, anyone at home? We've organised a... Sex in church? I'll come back later. Come here, stupid. So, what are we doing tonight? We've organised a seance, we found the little monkey. The little monkey? -Lillith. Who's Lillith? -You'd like to know, wouldn't you? Us as well. She come and goes... Appears and disappears. We reckon... ...she's a witch. Lillith, what are you doing? They'll be here at any minute. We agreed, didn't we? Take that stuff off and go. Lillith, did you hear me? What on earth are you wearing? What is all this mess? The clothes on the floor. Why did you come here? You deceived me. You're just like Manuel. She should never have come back. You told me she had gone away forever. You said it would just be you and me. Why did she come back? Why did she come back? -Little one... These are things you will never understand. You made her come back. Yes, you and Manuel... I don't want to see you again, I want to be left alone. I'm suffering. I'm suffering. Help. What's going on? What's happening to you, Lillith? Say something. I hear the brakes. Water... The sea. The rocks. It's Julienne. -Yes, it's Julienne. How did it happen? How did you die? Tell us. Kyra. It's her... I can feel her. It's her. She's coming. It's her. Go away. Go... You bring death with you, you must go away from here... Go away. Send her away... Send her away. Send her away. -What's wrong, Lillith? She brings death with her. Lillian. Lillian, what's wrong with you? Let's dance. -What great music. It's such a shame I can't smell the country air... It's all blocked up here. It's like being blind, or deaf. It's nice here. I don't understand why the locals say it's so bad up here... Do you know why? Sex maniac escapes from a lunatic asylum (?) house by the lake, (?) I know how to read. -No, it was open... There was only some some glue, (?) professional. Are you interested in post as well? -Superstitions, I told you, didn't I? (?) The postman didn't want to know and seeing as I was coming this way... Now you're going to ask me why I was coming this way? Well? You held a seance with your friends last night... But you left. This is where my professional curiosity comes in... Where did you go? I came here. Michele drowned... They found him this morning... In the river. Inspector, your tea is ready. It has the same taste, but it's not tea. If you ask me, Lillian got scared and Michele ran after her... No, I think Michele came on to her, I wanted to as well... But it worked out badly for him and he killed himself. Do you realise there are two dead people now? God rest their souls. There's nothing we can do... Do you want me to take these crazy stories seriously? Do you want me start crying like everybody else? All this talk of devils and witches. It was the devil, right? Sure. He should be taken seriously. Cut it out. You know it's all very strange. Yes, I know. I'm trying not to think about it. Did you see the body? Everyone saw it. -I'm interested in your opinion. People respect the dead, but they want something to fill their imagination... You, Inspector, can only offer one culprit... But those faces want more, much more. What happened? Alex. Why are you going away? Michele is dead, but what have I got to do with it? Why are you looking at me like that? What have I got to do with it? What do you want from me? Why are you looking at me like that? What have I done to you? I haven't done anything. Go away. You must go away from here. You bring death with you. Go away. You really are beautiful... Where are you running off to? Madam, don't hide... I've been following her for half an hour, she's a fast one. She might tell everyone I'm naked, even Satan has his weaknesses... Listen... -What a beauty. Sorry, if I'm not wearing a jacket but it's so hot... I'll take my trousers off soon. What happened? Why didn't you come earlier? No, no... You see? I can't leave you alone for a moment. (?) You say it doesn't matter... Where are you running off to? So this is the famous lake. Not bad... What time does it come out? -Who? Who? The monster. Hello. I'm talking to you. Who are you talking to? -I don't know. An apparition. A ghost... Pretty, though. Now it will be even harder to deal with this situation. It's time to end it all. It's been fifteen years... We won't be able to show ourselves in the village. We made a promise. Poor Lillith... She's like a daughter to me. -No... No one can be like a daughter. I can't. -Don't you think you're exaggerating? Two people have died. They're both dead... It's as though I killed them, don't you understand? But we're just getting started. We're taking off... Keep your feet on the ground. There are people planning expeditions to Mars... ...and you're worried about fainting. What do you think it is? It's an adrenaline rush, the pupils dilate... Blood rushes to the head, and you faint. It's just an emotion. I'm alive... Nothing happened... I'm alive. Nothing happened... Nothing. You've lost weight. You don't want this to end. It's only natural. If only you knew. You see, Lillith... If I'd only talked to you. Now... It's hard to find the words. To explain... Your face is dirty. I bet you don't even have a tissue? Here it is... Yes, Kyra's last descendants in chronological order... But some of the material has probably been take to the church in Bergen. However, I will do some more research. She's my mother. -What did you say? She's my mother... Kyra's last descendant. -Shit, that's all we needed. Then... I am too. -What? Those two guys were from my family as well, don't you see? Okay, you slept with them. Now, cut it out... You didn't know. -What does that mean? Now I know, and it doesn't change anything... I'm fed up with people telling me what to do. I'm going to see if there's anyone inside. It's not possible. Lillian, there's no one here. Lillian? Lillian? Lillian! Is this your car? It must be very beautiful. You're Lillian's friend, right? Yes, but how do you know? You're beautiful, like Lillian. Listen... Take her away, no one likes her except my friend, the painter. Who are you? -Can't you see? I'm a little girl, I always say people don't see... Even Lillian didn't understand. Will you take her away from here? Yes, of course, I'll take her away... But she doesn't want to go. I'm looking for her. She ran that way, you have to run as well... You must run that way. It was you. -Murderer. You're a murderer. Witch. Murderer. Let go of me. Come. Come with me. Do you know who I am? The daugher of the lady of the lake. -Aren't you scared? No. -Why? I don't know. -But you must know... You must know what you feel. You know I'm not a witch... You want to make love to me, don't you? -Yes. Like Michele, like Julien. -I know. Then you must go away, you can't stay here with me. Run away. Go, before it's too late... Run away. I must stay with you. The death bell. Why? Another one of you will die. It's her fault. She brought death here. You just stand there laughing... Singing... Dancing. Death arrived with her. Now she's killing another one of you. -Let's find her. There they are. Carlos, wait... Stop, Carlos. I haven't done anything. I didn't mean to hurt her. -Stop. I haven't done anything. -Carlos. Leave me alone. It's not my fault. We've got to stop him. Carlos is dead. -Just like the others... It's inevitable. It's all been written... It's the path of destiny. You are living out the last part of the legend... The tragic conclusion to the curse. -But you're crazy. That's what they all say, but you know it isn't true... Because you're different to them. You die and come back to life... It's your very nature which defends your creation... Any one of those guys would have generated other beings like you... An entire family. Equally ill-fated. Where's Lillian? -She killed another one, look. Poor Carlos, what a way to go. -She'll kill us all, she's a witch. No. -She'll kill you as well. Your husband, with little Lillian... You didn't want him to find out, but he did and he took her with him... You were pregnant. You had our baby inside of you. Lillith... My little one. (?) like Lillian... Destiny must prevail... The day Lillith and Lillian will meet. -You're crazy, my mother is dead... She's gone. I'm Lillian. I hate you. It's all your fault. Kyra's curse has become reality. No, it's not true. Kyra said that whoever of her descendants has two daughters... The second one would kill the first. You should never have come back, now I have to kill you. I always hated you. You're the reason my mother killed herself... She killed herself and left me alone. Alone, like an animal. I have to do it, I must break the curse. I have to kill you. Do you believe in witches?
