There was a children's home, just outside the city. The children lived happily there. They got every day something to eat They got something to eat every day and the adults took good care of them. Every summer the care workers went with them to a summer holiday camp. But one year they suddenly didn't go. The care workers said: "Nobody will go to the Holiday camp with you this year, nobody will pay us." So you'll have to stay home this year. Shit! Stupid people! I don't understand how they can do this to us. We want to go to a summer holiday camp anyway. But where can we go? I know. I was sailing with my father, and then we found a deserted island. Maybe we can go there. - How would we get there. We can take the train and then hire a boat. We can borrow some tents from the Youth Club, which is closed for the summer anyway. - Yes, that's a good idea. - The girls can't come along. This is only for boys. The girls will come along, they'll have to cook. I'll only go if I can take my Teddy. Oh no, you can't, there's no place in your knapsack for something like that. But I need him. We can't take all the usual stuff. Everyone will know what's going on, if we take suitcases and sleeping bags, everyone will know what we're up to. We also need cooking stuff. How long will we be gone? Well, at least a week. So, we need to get food for 14 people people for a week. Where are you going to get the money? We can play, or maybe the old folks will give us a little money. Not so loud, someone will hear us! We need that. And this perhaps. And onions. Leave us Alone # In summer, life's so simple, # we're the children of the sun. # And the city is grey and dull, # we're going to the boats and life on the beach. # The winter is over now, # we're leaving the city, # and are as free as the wind. # In summer, life's so simple, # we're the children of the sun. # And the city is grey and dull, # we're going to the boats and life on the beach. # When the sun shines, life is fun, # We travel on the adventure of our lives together. # We'll find a place where we'll settle down. # So please leave us alone, leave us alone. # In summer, life's so simple, # we're the children of the sun. # We're going to the boats and life on the beach. # The winter is over now, # we're leaving the city, # and are as free as the wind. # When the sun shines, life is fun, # We travel on the adventure of our lives together. # So please leave alone, # leave us alone, # leave us alone. Now I'm really tired from running. Why don't we stay here? No, I want to go up there. Hey, wait for me! Look, we can have a drink here! - Oh yes, I'm thirsty. Oh you clumsy fool! If you go that way from our side of the island, you'll see nothing but water. Knock it off. Stop it. - Why? Cut it out. - No. Stop it! Do you want a fight? Say uncle! Do you give in? Do you give in? - Okay. Do you give in? - Yes! - What are you doing there? - I'm digging a hole. What do you want to use the hole for? Well, it's always good to have a hole. - Let me have a go. - Okay. But it's my hole! I want it back, it's mine! You'll experience a time where your emotions and feelings become stronger. - You'll think about boys more often. - No, I don't think so. - Shall we take off our blouses? - Okay. Listen to this: "He presses her against his chest, She couldn't describe the feeling. The only thing she could say was: "I love you!" And then she felt him put his arms around her. She felt a sense of extreme happiness." How romantic. There is no news of the 15 children, who disappeared from the children's home. Someone may remember seeing them on their way to Sweden, but a lot has disappeared from the home, and the thefts at the grill suggest... that they're planning a longer absence. The disappearance of the children was possibly caused by the teachers, who started a strike without having a plan for the children. They're talking about us on the news. But how come they think, we're going to Sweden? We've gone in exactly the opposite direction. Maybe there are other explanations, or Jens has lied to us. Do you think I'm lying to you? If you think that, come here and fight! Take it easy. Has anyone seen the plastic bags with the bread and butter and cheese, which we bought in the supermarket? - I gave them to him. - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. - Say that again. - You had them. It doesn't matter who lost them. It's only important that they're now gone. Someone lost them somewhere. Henrik is stupid! If anyone wants biscuits and cola, come here. Do you leave on your boots on while sleeping? Someone here keeps farting, it stinks like hell. Don't blow your smoke in my face. Here, take a drag. There's a draught here, it's making me feel sick. It doesn't matter where you lie, it goes everywhere. Its also here, it's the same. But you lie between me and him, So you don't feel the draught. - I'm getting sick. If you want to stay here, lie down there. Two men masturbated and one said: "You know you'll go blind." And the other said: "I don't care. I do it just until I need glasses." Do you know why they build round houses for the mentally ill? I don't know. They don't want them to piss in the corners. Where's the boat? - The boat is gone. - There it is, far out to sea. Didn't you tie the boat up yesterday? It's broken free. So far out there... This is bad. - You have to swim out and get it. - Now we have nothing to eat. No, Henrik, don't do it. You can't manage it! This is really bad. Shit, why couldn't you tie it up properly? Leave Henrik alone. Let's go up to the others. You're so stupid, you son of a bitch, you're really stupid! Hey man, not so much. It has to go around everyone. The food will only last for four days. I don't care. There's no problem, you can read about this in any children's book. On desert islands, there's good food. We can catch animals and birds. We can go fishing. Maybe we'll catch a whale, that's lots of food. And maybe tigers and lions. - Svend? - What? - Are you asleep? - No. Why don't we slide under my blanket together? All right. And why don't we take off our underpants? Okay, we can do that. I feel so strange. Hey, they're all still asleep. Ready, one, two, three! What the hell is this? Who did this? We have to wash this, even if we don't have any washing powder. I'm really interested in Martin. Who do you like? - Jens. No, he's such a tough guy. I don't think it is so tough. - Why? - Maybe he's just pretending? - Why? Because there are so many other guys here. I'd like to get to know him. I think he's a nice guy. What are you doing? Making soup? Yes, nettle soup. - Nettle soup? Oh, that's great. Then we'll go down and fish. The soup is very nutritious and the younger ones have nervous stomachs. They have a stomach ache, so we have to give them something good, And at night they ask for their parents and are homesick. It's not my fault. I don't care if they have a stomachache and are homesick. We're stuck here and we can't go to the beach and say: "Hey, can you pick us up from the island?" Yeah, sure. I don't think we'll catch anything here. We have to go much further out to catch fish. I understand, we're too close to the beach. Did you catch anything? - No. It's so dark, I'm scared. - The sun will be out again tomorrow. - I'm scared. Try to get some sleep. Come here. Everything will be fine again in the morning. It's still alive. That was a good catch. You cut, while I hold it, and you can cut off the head. Okay. Hold it firmly. Ha, very tasty. Will you give me the plate? I just have to clean it properly. Here. I really don't like the food. We have to eat what we have. We have no restaurant here. I miss the food we get at home. I don't like that either, but it doesn't matter. This is food. Without this, it's hard to survive. I think it tastes awful. - Has anyone seen Sven? - No. Maybe he took the train. Have you perhaps seen Sven? Can we help you build the hut? From now on you'll get no more biscuits. Come on, let's try it again. What are you doing? Taking a crap, what else? What a bummer, the plates are trashed. Everything here is trashed. You must see that it doesn't work like this. It stinks everywhere, people don't care, and we have to do something. For example, we need a place where we shit and pee. If we have to stay here long, we'll drown in our own shit. We need to choose people who make the food, clean the fireplace, look after at the rest of the dishes we have. Everyone must take responsibility, And someone has to cook. Tina and I cook every day. It would nice if sometimes others would cook. You there, listen, we have to do something. This isn't working, also, we must find a way to get home. When Marianne and I were at the beach, we saw a boat. We waved but they didn't take any notice. Get out of the sun. "Ice man". You damned fool! Come on, it's Svend. Help me! I don't think we can do anything. He's so cold. We need to keep him warm! Try to revive him! - I don't know how to do it. We were at the beach and suddenly Svend was lying there. We pulled him to the beach. And tried to revive him. We tried everything, but he was dead. Stone-dead. Hey, what happens when you die and are buried? Then you go to God, who will take care of you. But if you're still in the hole where you were buried. How can you at the same time to be with God? The animals in the hole will help God and take care of it. But I don't understand how he can go up to God in heaven. Only the soul goes up to God, the body remains in the hole. Why don't we burn him like we did with my grandma when she died? I want to have it properly and not be burnt if I die. My mother told me she doesn't want to be burned when she dies, and that goes for me too. If you feel that way, I have a big hole. We can bury him in it. Do you know the story of the man who was buried alive? He woke up six feet under ground. Say something, eh? What are you doing here? Why are you alone? Come with us, don't sit here alone. Go to hell, I want to be alone. I've had enough of walking. If you don't want walk, then go back to the others. We're building our own camp. Then we don't have to bother with the little ones... and the girls and everything. I could really do with a steak right now. Have you seen any trotters around here? Wild pigs? You're really funny. I've seen pheasants down in the wood. - Pheasants. - Yes. Why can't you keep quiet? Shut up! Don't touch me. Go to hell, damn it! Ok? Make dinner while I'm gone. I'm just going for a walk. Look what I've found. Oh, you're so lucky. Can I have it? No, you maniac! I've haven't had any sweets for ages. - Can I buy it for a Krone? - No way! Oh please... - I'll give you five. - No. - Ten. - No. I'll give you 20 Krone. 40 Krone. 50 Krone. - Okay. Then just let me try it first. - Okay. Martin, why are you in the children's home? What happened? It's because my mother got sick, and I couldn't stay with any friends. And my father had left us many years before. Is it dull, living alone with your mother? No, we had lots of fun, and she said that as long I stay with her, there wouldn't be another man in her life. My mother is a very friendly and nice person. You must visit us, when we go back. I mean, if we go back. I really like you. You are very beautiful. Come here. What happened? I don't want to die. This is so hard. Yes, we can take this and that. It will work, we need to think of a name for the raft. - It doesn't look very safe. - Don't forget the seatbelt. Don't worry. We're sure that you'll reach the other shore. Good luck. The raft looks very funny. Hey, we just have to fix it properly, and on the other side we can buy cigarettes. And maybe you can rent boats there. Hey, how are you? Wow, they're very nice. That's great, and that's a sea urchin. This is also a sea urchin. And this is fantastic. Were you ever at a political meeting? No. You? Yes, I was in the park, where the speeches are made on the 1st of May. And at a meeting organized by the New Society. They lived up in the North in a community where they shared everything. They live together and share things. But what if you want to be alone? That's no problem in this community. You have the right to be alone, if you wish. I was also at a meeting of the city delegates. There representatives met, to help the mayor run the city. But the idea behind the New Society, which could be very good, could also work for us. It would be great if we could become friends, and that we could run things here together. as it is now, there'll be a war, because we work against each other. I prefer it when we're together, sharing everything. We respect each other and consider this as a community, in which everyone bears responsibility. Actually, I'd like to be in a communist camp. Communism is the society where people respect each other, and share things, where you can feel a shared responsibility. It means love and cohesion, and everyone gets the same. No one gets a lot of money and no one gets too little money. We'll try to catch a few pheasants with this bow and arrow. I'm trying to make you feel like a warrior. Stop those idiots! Look how beautiful it's made. You can have the last shot of the pheasant. Yes, we can. We'll kill animals and take them, and prepare food from them. Do you remember the movie "A Man Called Horse"? They put eagle claws in his shoulders and lifted him up. They hung him then, up in the trees. We can do tests like that, we can cut our hands. And mix our blood and stuff. Okay, if you cut yourself first, I'll cut myself afterwards. Okay, then give me the knife. Now we're real Indians. We got it! Hi. What are you doing here in our territory? What are you doing? Do you want to kill me? Hit him if he resists. Hit him in the stomach. So are trying to resist? Idiots! Don't call us idiots. Stop, you're crazy. You've invaded our territory. Why don't we blind him? I want to go home now. I really want to go home. Everything's going wrong. And now I've cut my leg. I want to go home and have real food. Everyone thinks only of himself and nobody thinks of others. Where's Henrik? I haven't seen him. This is bad. He should be home after dark, this is scary. Maybe he fell and broke his leg or something. - Perhaps he's in the other camp. - No, he'd never do that. That is nonsense. Maybe he's lying somewhere, surely something's happened to him. Why don't we go go and look for him? No, it is too dark to go off now. What if he falls asleep? Then he'll surely hang himself. If someone wants to go down and pull him out of the noose, please. Ok, I'll go and check on him. Henrik, no... Henrik! He's... What do you mean? He's dead. What? - Yes. What is with the rope? It wasn't that tight. He could have pulled out a hand and freed himself. He was very pale. Pale and cold. If he's hanged himself, it's not our fault. Shall we tell the others? No, definitely not. Henrik! Henrik! Henrik! I can't get the fire lit. We haven't any water. Your job. Kenneth's turn. He's slept all day. Now go and get some water. You have to go down and get some water. If you don't want to go and fetch water, then you can go to the other group and join them. The other group are all coming here. Martin!
