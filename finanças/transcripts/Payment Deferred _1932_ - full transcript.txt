Oh, that's the Marble girl. Well, it is the first time I have actually been inside a house .. Where there has been a murder committed. Yes, it's not everyone that gets the chance. I have half a mind to take it. It has a kind of attraction. If you're quick, it's yours for the asking. Blimey. What is this? Why, it's Marble's umbrella. I'd know it anywhere. Then you knew him? - Knew him? Knew him for years. I was one of the principal witnesses for The Crown. Seeing that I was the only one that knew the family before it happened. I should very much like to hear about it. Well, if you take this place, I am next door. Of course, there are always certain things. That are not made public. Ah, you are right there. Oh. The cupboard they spoke about in the case. The glass fronted one. - Well? Now, where exactly was it? Oh. Right over there. That is where they kept the bottle of cyanide, eh? Oh, I see. Yes. There with his photographic stuff. I .. I suppose there is no doubt. That he really did it? Nobody round here ever had any doubt. I said he was guilty from the start. And I was his best friend. - Yes, but. Now look here. I knew him and I knew her. His wife? - Yes. Now if you ask em what was the cause of it, I would say it was her. Nagging at him until he didn't rightly know what he was doing. I know what women are. Then you heard her? Well, I didn't exactly hear her, no. But one can put two and two together, can't they? And I'll take my oath she was the cause of it. Nagging at him until he didn't rightly know what he was doing. They were owing money all over the place. And she was asking him for more every week than he could possibly manage. At least that's what I think. Everyone around here will say the same thing. That she was the cause of it all. At him morning, noon and night. Nag, nag, nag. Yes. If walls had ears these have heard a thing or two. If walls could talk. They might tell a different story. It's nearly 8:30, dear. I know. Winnie. Winnie. Coming, mum. Your breakfast is getting cold, dear. Did you ask him? - Not yet. Hello, Daddy. - Morning, dear. Be sure to keep your coat buttoned up, dear. I don't know when we've had so much rain. Day after day the same. Goodbye. - Bye, dear. Oh, Will. Will, could you .. Could you manage to let me have a little something for Winnie's school? They spoke to her again about it yesterday. It is very awkward for her. - For the love of her, I haven't any. It would be such a pity for her to have to give up the course. She is getting along so nicely with her shorthand. I can't do it, Annie. Please Daddy. I wish you could. If I stay on a little bit longer then I will be a full-fledged stenographer. Then I can help. - That's right, Will. What's the use of talking like this Annie? With nothing coming in until the end of the month and today only the tenth. Let alone having to live in the meantime. Daddy, please. - I'll not talk to you, Miss. You go to school this morning and tell them you can't go on with it. Expecting me to find money for your typing. When I can't pay the milkman or the grocer. Goodbye, dear. - Goodbye. Mr Marble. - Morning, Cuhlen. You promised to settle your account the first of the month. Today is then tenth and I haven't seen a copper. I say, didn't Mrs Marble come across? No, she didn't. But there is a limit. Until I see the colour of your money she can't get as much as a blooming kidney. There. Look at him. Just because wears a bowler hat and has to dress respectable .. He's too good for the rest of us. Surely he is a banker? A what? - A banker. A banker? My dear. He is a banker's clerk. Why, he is broke to the world. They owe bills all over the place. And my husband says he is sick of having to buy him drinks. Is that so? Will you change this into English money, please? Certainly, madam. I will come back for it. - Very good, madam. I say, Marble. That was a good hunch of yours alright. - What? About the Franc going up. I got a real tip. My cousin at the Paris branch. - Well? Keep this under your hat. There's a rumour in Paris that a French group are going to manipulate the Franc. A chance to make a lot of money. - What? I wonder if you could let me have that two pounds I lent you? Sorry, old boy. I simply haven't got it. I don't know which way to turn. Madam. Thank you. Mr Marble. - Yes? Mr Edwards wants to see you in his office immediately. Alright. You wanted me, sir? Yes. It has come to the notice of the bank that the firm of Norton and Craig .. Are bringing action against you .. For the recovery of the sum of a 125 pounds 13 shillings and 6 pence. Which you owe them. - But I understood, sir .. You are aware of the very strict rule of this bank. That an employee involved in any legal action of this kind. Is liable to instant dismissal. Now you have been twenty years in this bank, Marble. For that reason I am giving you the opportunity to adjust matters. If you can pay this firm I will take no further notice. Otherwise, it means instant dismissal. Do you understand? - Yes, sir. Now, this is Saturday. I will give you until Tuesday to settle the affair. That is all. Thank you, sir. Heaven knows. What can we do? But we must do something. It's no use sitting there and saying we must do something. If you had thought about it a bit sooner and kept these accounts down .. That might have been more sense. Here is Colvin. Five pounds. How on earth did you manage to run up an account like that Anne? Just for milk. But you don't understand, dear. Thirty-five shillings goes nowhere nowadays. It isn't enough for the three of us. Really it isn't, dear. Only this morning, Mrs Hammond was saying over the back wall. That is not the point. The point is what we can afford. So it's no use talking about what Mrs Hammond says. I don't think that's quite fair, dear. There are a lot of things there that I never ordered. I don't see what you mean. If they're on here you've ordered them, haven't you? No, dear. They are lots of your things. Meaning? Well the .. Those photography things for instance. If you look at the chemist's bill you .. You will see that there is .. Film and Hypo and .. Cyanide of something. I couldn't have ordered that. I don't even know what it is. That is his photography stuff, mum. It's poison. Cyanide. Yes. I had forgotten. It looks as if we may need a drop before we are through with this. Well, it's soon over. So I have heard. How can you say things like that? And in front of Winnie too. It's got too much for me, Annie. I can't get away from it for a single second. I lay awake at night. Thinking and thinking. Yes, dear. I know. It means the Poor House. - Oh no. No, it can't. It can't. It mustn't. If you thought about it sooner and kept the accounts down .. Daddy, it's awfully difficult. Really it is. Remember when mother was ill. - Who asked you? You keep your mouth shut. When I want your opinion I'll ask for it, see. Daddy, you don't know how we .. - Oh stop it! This house would drive anybody crazy. I have enough on my mind without you .. [ Door knocks ] The front door. Half past eight? Maybe it is Charlie Hammond. No. That's not his knock. The bailiffs. Evans hasn't wasted much time. Oh, Will. [ Door knocks ] You had better see. Mr Marble? - Won't you come in? Thank you. Someone to see you, father. Mr Marble, isn't it? Yes. Good. Found you first shot. I don't expect you know me. No, I don't think so. Well, it has been a long time since you saw me last. My name is Medland. Medland? - Yes. Jim Medland. My mother was your sister, wasn't she? Not Winn's boy? Good lord. You must excuse me. It gave me a bit of a start you coming in like that. Here. Let me introduce you. This is Annie. Your aunt, I mean. - How do you do? Nicely, thank you. Winnie, here is a new cousin for you. This is our girl. How do you do? We named her after your mother you know. Oh yes? - Well, you .. You had better sit down and tell us all the news. Yes, rather. I think I will go out and get rid of my taxi. Taxi? Yes, he's outside waiting. I wasn't sure I'd got the right place. I see. - I won't be long. A taxi, eh? Will, maybe he can help us? I know. Did you see that coat? That's worth a tenner if it's worth a penny. And you can't get over from Australia unless you have got a bit. Now you wait. Just leave this to me. Ooh. What a bit of luck, eh? Will, we have got to offer him something. There's enough whiskey left for two drinks. No. I'm not wasting that on a mere boy. Don't you think of it. I see you go in for photography there. Yes. Why? Do you? - Yes, I am rather keen. I have just got a topping new camera with a telephoto lens. I'd like to see your pictures. I'm afraid I don't have very much in that way. I have .. I am not an expert, you know. Well .. you had better come in and get warm. You must be frozen. Sit down. I've never known such a night. Yes. It's pretty awful, isn't it. Does it always rain like this in England? I suppose this is about the worst we've had this year. Where have you just come from? - Euston Station. I have just dumped my luggage there. - Oh. Well. How is your mother after all this time? - Oh. Mother died six months ago. I say. I had no idea. That's terrible that is. Yes. She never got over the shock of father's death you know. Tom dead too? You don't say so. Upon my soul that is rough luck and no mistake. You didn't know then about mother? - Not a word. It must be 15 or 16 years since we heard from her. It was after they first went out to Australia. Well, how did you ever manage to find us? Mother hunted down the address ages ago. She planned to come over with me. I thought I'd look you up right away. - Quite right too. I thought you might know the best hotel to stay at. Someone on the boat said The Carlton wasn't bad. The Carlton? The Carlton? Oh yes, yes. You might do worse. A good deal worse. Of course, it isn't exactly what I would call cheap. But I suppose that doesn't matter much in your case. Well, I'll give it a run for a day or two while I look around. Have you seen many kangaroos? Kangaroos? Why, rather. I have hunted them quite a bit. Oh, I say. Kangaroos. Ha. What will the child be thinking of next? Did you ever know such a kid? Well, how about a bit of supper? I am afraid we haven't any .. Thanks, no. I just had something before I came down. I'd like to smoke though, if I may. - Why, of course. Oh. Here. Have one of these. - No, no. You take one of mine. That's a nice case you've got. - Yes. It's a birthday present. It is rather well made. Well-lined too. What? The notes, you mean? Isn't that rather a lot for a young man to be carrying about with him? No. I don't think so. A match? Thank you. Did you have it very rough on your journey? Yes. It was pretty rough all last week. Don't you bother to sit up Annie if your headache is bad. I am sure Jim will excuse you if you would rather go on up. I didn't realise you were feeling rotten. Look here, I will go. - No, no. Please. You stay here and talk to Will. I'll say goodnight if you don't mind. - Of course not. Goodnight. I hope you'll come again sometime. - Yes. Thanks. Goodnight, Jim. Goodnight, Winnie. If you are asleep I shan't disturb you. Come on, dear. Look, I mustn't stop long. - That's alright. There's no hurry is there? Seeing as you are a gay young bachelor. What are your plans after you have had a good look round London? Nothing very definite. Are you going to stay over here? For good I mean. Yes, yes. Provided I get a job which suits me of course. Why? I was only thinking you probably might want to invest your capital. Did your mother ever tell you anything about my job, I wonder? Yes, I think so. It is something to do with a bank or something like that. Yes, County National. Foreign Exchange. What I was going to say is .. It's pretty lucky for you that you turned up when you did. You've come just at a moment when I may be able to do you rather a good turn. You? Why, how do you mean? Through my job I get bits of information that don't reach everybody else. I got a bit this morning from a chap at the Paris branch. He says .. that certain interests are going to manipulate the Franc again. Oh? And what does that mean? - It means simply this. The Franc is going to rise. Rise like a sky-rocket. I'm afraid that's all rather Greek to me. It closed tonight at 120. Anyone who bought it at that or near it would make a fortune. Oh. And if one knows the ropes one can buy on what is called a margin. That is, by only putting up ten percent of the purchase money. It's the sort of chance fellows in my job wait years, for this is. That is why I say you're lucky to turn up when you did. But why? What has it got to do with me? You have got the capital. And I have got the knowledge. It seems to me we ought to make a pretty strong combination. I really have very little money that I can touch. You only need a little. You have probably got enough in your case. No thanks. I am not keen on it. But dash it all. You don't object to making money, do you? If the Franc goes to 60 and you'd bought tonight you'd make 100% on your money. But if you had bought on a margin you would have made a thousand. Yes, I see. But I don't know much about that sort of thing. But I am saying you don't have to know anything about it all. No. Perhaps not. Well, to tell you the truth I don't much like the sound of it. What do you mean? You mean I'm suggesting something that isn't straight? No, of course not. But what do you stand to gain by it? Well, if it came off .. I should naturally expect a commission. You wouldn't grudge me ten percent, would you? Why not do the thing yourself and take the whole lot? Well now, Jim. I will be perfectly frank with you. One needs capital and like the chap in the storybook, Jim .. That's a thing that just at the moment I haven't got. I see. Well, I am not interested. Don't you be a young fool. I know a lot more about this game than you do. Look here. You take my advice and think it over. It's no use. It is no use at all. I am quite certain now. I see. I say. You are not resenting anything I said just now, are you? Let's forget it. I must explain. Only you see, I have been having a bit of trouble lately. There isn't any reason why you shouldn't know. Over money. I have got Annie and the kid to think of. If I don't find 100 pounds pretty quick it means the Poor House for all 3 of us. I am very sorry, but I .. - I think the shame of that .. Would kill me. I don't know which way to turn. Straight, I don't. I wonder if I can ask you a favour. Lend me a hundred until the end of the month? I swear I'll pay it back. Every penny. I'm very sorry but I really haven't the money to spare. I think it is a great pity I ever came down here. You are not going? - Yes, I must. I can't let you go like that. I'd feel you wouldn't care to come here again. Well, to be quite candid with you I wouldn't. From practically the first moment I stepped inside this room .. You've done nothing else but try and get money out of me one way or another. I'm sorry to have to talk to you like this but .. Well. You rather asked for it, you know. Surely, you see that I can't .. You are quite justified. I have behaved very badly. I am awfully sorry but .. - No. You are quite right. It isn't much use me apologising. But there is one thing I would like to ask. Would you have a drink with me before you go? Just to show there is no ill-feeling. Alright, yes. Thanks. But I am afraid it will have to be rather a quick one. Sit down for half a minute. Here. Take a look at this. Anybody you know there? Is this your wedding? Yes. That's right. What was that? I didn't hear anything. It sounded like young Winnie calling out. Just a minute. I had better just see. It is the storm, you know. She is a nervy kid. You don't mind? - Of course not. A false alarm. Must have been the storm. Is mother here? Yes, that's right. On the left there, isn't she? Oh yes. Obviously taken a long time before they went to Melbourne. I expect it was. Well. Drink up. Cheerio. Just look at that. How I'm ever going to get them clean, I don't know. Mum, however does he get them in such a mess? I can't imagine. He must have gone somewhere with Mr Medland. On a night like that? He sure messed up the garden alright. It looks like a marsh. Dad. Breakfast will be ready soon. Sunday morning. Kippers. Did you call your father, Winnie? - He's coming. I hear him. Morning, Dad. - Morning, Will. It's nice to have a fine Sunday at last, isn't it. Mum .. do you think we could go somewhere? Why yes, I think that might be nice. - No. Perhaps your father needs a reset, Winnie. Whatever happened last night, Will? What do you mean? Well, your clothes. I never saw such a mess in my life. I fell down. How did you come to fall, Will? I don't know quite. Dark. I went out with .. Medland. To get a taxi. I came in by the back way. And I fell over the border. Pouring with rain. I thought Mr Medland was awfully nice. Didn't you, mum? Yes. I thought he was quite a nice young man. Do you think he will come here much? - I expect so. Did he stay out late, Will? I didn't hear you come up. I remember waking up once and looking at the clock and you hadn't come up to bed. The storm was making such a noise. Like .. Furniture being dragged about. Why, Will. You haven't eaten your breakfast. Isn't it good? I'm not hungry. I do hope you didn't catch a chill last night. You must have been drenched. That suit really ought to go to the cleaners. But we owe them such a lot. Pay them and pay Evans. Why, Will. Did Mr Medland help you out? Yes. Oh, how lovely. Oh, that was generous of that boy, wasn't it dear. We must do everything we can to pay him back. Of course. In time. Oh dear. I do wish I could have offered him some supper last night. Did you offer him the whiskey? For heaven's sake let's talk about something else, Annie. He is strange this morning, isn't he. Will. Will. Who's that? What is the matter, dear? - Nothing. Hello yourself, young woman. Hello, Will. - Oh, it's you. Who did you think it was? Great Garbo? And how is Mrs M? - Nicely, thank you. That's good. Well, Will. How is the world treating you? Alright. And you? - Mustn't grumble. Sold two houses this week and one is a bargain. If it doesn't fall down. Have you seen that new shop on the corner? Mountsie Road? No. They have very nice things there. Madame Collins, you know. Hello, hello. Started gardening at you time of life. Been digging a bit. Those weeds? I haven't touched them. It must be that dog of Kingston's. It is always straying about. You'd better hire him. He'll clean your garden cheap. And that reminds me. Have you ever thought of moving? Moving? - Out of here, I mean. We got a nice little place on our books. Will suit you right down to the ground. And dirt cheap too. - We aren't moving. There's no harm talking of it. You'd like to go to the country, wouldn't you? Oh yes. We aren't moving from here. We shall never move from here. Never? Never is a long time, Will. This is the nicest bit of property. I don't care what it is. I don't care if it is Buckingham Palace rent free. I don't want it. That's plain enough, isn't it? - Alright, alright. No offence when none is meant. The reason I asked was that .. Hello. What's up? If you come in this garden again, I'll break your neck. Well, I'll be blowed. I am worried. He acts so strange. I never saw such a thing in my life. Will. Jones's boy is a little pest, isn't he. Well, why don't you move? Now, it's no use beating about the bush. You have got to move. These houses are going to be sold. Sold? Yes, but don't worry about it. I expect we'll be able to fix you up alright. No, you won't! We're stopping here. If we have to buy this place. Buy it. You see? Will, how can we buy it? Where would we ever find the money, dear? We'll find it. We've got to. We've got to. Congratulations, Mr Marble. - Thank you. Congratulations, Mr Marble. Glad for your assistance. - You've no-one to thank but yourself. You've shown remarkable insight, Mr Marble. Remarkable ability. Remarkable courage, if I may say so. Not at all. A bit of luck you know. Well, good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Has anyone been? - Hello. No, dear. Why? Nothing. Winnie. Get me a glass. Will. Six? Aren't they rather expensive? Ha. Very expensive. Can we afford it, dear? Ha! We can afford to bathe in it. Well. Here is to you. Will. Have you made some money? A little. Nothing much. Just about enough to keep us all in luxury for the rest of our lives. That's all. How much do you mean? - The right side of .. Thirty thousand pounds, shall we say? Thirty thousand pounds? Thirty thousand? Daddy. Will. How can you have made all that? Perhaps because I'm not quite the fool that you thought, Annie. I had a gamble in Francs and it happened to come off. You wouldn't understand. - Oh, Daddy. That's marvellous. Will. Does that .. Does that mean you will lose your job? No. But the job is going to lose me. - Mummy, don't you see? Daddy doesn't have to work. We are rich. Well. I can't get over it. Thirty thousand pounds. Why, we can have those new curtains for the front. Yes. And the back too and new carpets. And new clothes. Now we can have fun like other people do. Wait when the news gets round. Those who look down on us because we've no money. And now we can look down on them. - That's right, my girl. They are going to be green with envy. Daddy. Couldn't we move to a nicer neighborhood? Oh, I have always wanted a little house in the country. Yes please, Daddy. Can we? - No, we can't. Besides. As a matter of fact I fixed up this afternoon. To buy this place. Buy it? - Yes. Well then. If we are staying on here. The house needs doing over badly. You mean you'd like some new furniture? Alright then, you shall have it. No, not so much that dear but .. The walls and the ceiling and the outside. That would mean workmen. All over the place. But dear, if we are so well off now, we .. We could go on a holiday while they do it. Yes, Daddy. Couldn't we? Somewhere smart. Bournemouth or Brighton. Auntie Evans went to Southend last year and I never heard the end of it. That is an idea. You need a good holiday, Annie. How would you like to stay at a swanky hotel? Somewhere lively where there's a band and a pier and whatnot. Eh Winnie? That would be marvellous, Daddy. Wouldn't it, mum? We'd meet lots of nice people. Ladies and gentlemen, I mean. You'll be in with all the Nobs, Winnie. You'll be looking down on your old father likely enough before long. No, Dad. I won't. To dress every night for dinner. I shall need lots of new clothes. I will go and make a list. Oh, this is too marvellous. Do you really think we can manage it, Will? Of course we can. Oh, I am glad. You need a rest. Me? Yes, dear. You need a change more than any of us. I shan't be going. But dear, you have been so nervous lately. So jumpy. I feel better than I have felt for some time. Very well, dear. Well, I will .. I will have to get somebody in to look after you while we are away. You will do nothing of the sort. How many times have I told you I won't have strangers nosing about this place? What is more, I am not going to have it. See? Will. Will. I don't quite know how to say it. Can't you tell me? - Tell you? All about it I mean. About what? What are you talking about? I'll never blame you, whatever you've done. Really I wouldn't. How do you mean, whatever I have done? Can't you trust me? It frightens me not knowing. I'd much rather you told me everything. I don't know what you are driving at. I couldn't help guessing, dear. You have looked so worried and .. And that jumpiness when anyone knocks. What have you guessed? You know what I am trying to say. I suppose. I do know. Really. You know? Yes, dear. You have looked so frightened. I couldn't help noticing. I have tried to think in wasn't that. That? I've tried to pretend to myself that it was all my imagination. But all the time, I .. I knew. Oh, I don't mean to worry you more, dear. I only felt if you could talk to me about it, it might help. There is only one thing. Does anyone suspect? Alright, dear. Alright. We won't talk about it anymore. I only felt that .. That if the bank should send someone here when you weren't home .. I shouldn't .. The bank? When they find the money is gone, I mean. Yes, dear. I guessed. A man in your position. Thousands of pounds like that. The temptation. Will. Why do you look at me like that? I couldn't help knowing sooner or later, could I? Don't. Don't do that. What is it? What have I ..? You will be the death of me, Annie. What do you mean, Will? You don't think I am a thief, do you? That is funny. Oh, it is all too lovely. I hate to leave it. Really I do. Well, it will be here when you come back. Won't you change your mind and take us to the station, dear? No. I think I'll lie down for a bit. I've got a bit of a headache. What's that? Books. I thought I would do a bit of reading while you are away. My word. A taxi, if you please. I say. Take a look at our neighbors, will you. They are off to the seaside. Is it true they have made some money? Some money? He made a fortune. - Oh? Is that his wife in those dreadful clothes? Yes. And that is his kid. That stuck-up little baggage. Goodbye, Daddy. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Take care of yourself. - I'll be alright. Goodbye. Goodbye, goodbye. The women. They go alone. Oh yes. Poor man. He will be very, very lonely. [ Door knocks] [ Door knocks ] I am Madam Collins. I have a little shop around the corner. Oh yes? You see, we are neighbours. - Yes. I have heard so much about the celebrated Mr Marble. That is you, is it not? Well, Marble is right. I don't know so much about the celebrated. You are too modest. Everybody knows the fortune you have made in France. How clever you are with affairs. Do they, though? My husband, he understands nothing about affairs. So I have no-one to advise. I say to myself. I will ask this clever Mr Marble. But really. I am so bold. Not at all. If there's anything I can do at any time I shall be only too delighted to help. Sometime when you are not busy. I am .. I am sure you are busy tonight. Well, not at all. Won't you come in? Thank you. Oh .. c'est tr?s bon. This beautiful furniture. Just a few odds and ends I picked up last week. All in such charming taste. It reminds me of my home in France. We have many pieces of this kind in the ch?teau of my father. Indeed? I am sorry my wife isn't here. She would have been glad to meet you. Oh. Your wife is not at home? No. She has gone away for a holiday. Well, won't you sit down? Yes, perhaps. In one minute. So, you are from the little shop at the corner? Yes. Your beautiful things make me a little envieux. Tress bien. Oh. How interesting. He is so .. male. I beg your pardon? He is so a .. what you say? He-man? Oh, I see. - Uhuh. What? Oh, la-la. Do you smoke? Thank you. Yes. A silver cigarette case. A present from a lady, I am sure. - No, no. No, no, no, no. No, no. As a matter of fact I bought it myself. But I cannot listen to such stories. No. Really, Madame. I am afraid it is the truth. Oh no. Funny we haven't me before, isn't it. Living so close, I mean. But I am glad we have met today. The people I meet here are so dull. Always in France, we ride, we dance, we swim. Here I am tied to the little shop. Ah well. We must try to smile, eh? But it is lonely. My husband is in hospital in France. The war. Where was he wounded? Oh. That I cannot tell you. Oh. Terrible. I say, what is your name? Margarita. But my friends, they call me Rita. Including me? If you like. I think your wife would be a little .. surprised, huh? I shouldn't call you that in front of her. Oh .. I think you are a very naughty man. It is your fault you know if I am. My fault? But why, if you please? You are .. I should like to have a talk with you sometime. You are so wonderful. I have never met anyone like you before. I wonder if you and I .. What are you laughing at? Ah, you amuse me so much. You big masterful man. You know, sometimes you have thought of something you want .. Then .. voila. It is arranged. But what about me? Have I nothing to say in the matter? Yes, of course. But I sort-of thought if you are lonely, well .. I am lonely too. But I only tease you. What were you going to say? A nice bit of lace that. Do you think so? Well. Your last evening, huh? It will have to be for a bit, anyway. You have missed them very much, huh? You know I haven't. It's been wonderful, Rita. You have made all the difference. You don't know what it has meant your coming in like this. At times, I have almost managed to forget. That you have a wife, eh? No. Not that. Annie is alright. What then? Never you mind. Have a drink. No. But you shall have one. I want to talk to you. What about? Your wife comes home tomorrow. Perhaps I shall not see you soon. Darling. You do love me, don't you? You know I do, Rita. Then you will do something for me that I ask? That depends. I must have 300 pounds. Huh? - Just a loan. If I go bankrupt I lose the little shop. Yes. But 300? That's a lot of money, that is. I can't afford to splash it about like that. It is always the same way. You say that you love me. You say that you are grateful. It is I who give everything. But you .. That's not fair, Rita. There's no need to go on like this. If it is not convenient. Forget that I have asked. - Rita. I dare say I might be able to manage a little towards it. Darling. You are always so kind. And I love you so much. Rita, when you come close to me like this I will do anything you ask. Anything. It is a funny thing. Then you will give me the 300 pounds, huh? Oh, you are a knock-out, aren't you. Where are you going? To get my hat. Don't go, Rita. It is awful here alone. I'll get in a terrible state after you've gone. I can't think why you are like this. I do not understand at all why you are so frightened. I can't explain. I am. That's all. I get so that I don't now what I am doing. Don't go, Rita. But I have been here for hours. Now, Rita. - I mean that. Now, Rita. - I must go. Rita. [ Door knocks ] Alright. Keep quiet. I'll get rid of whoever it is. Hello, Dad. I didn't know you were .. Why didn't you let me know? What does it matter? Aren't you glad to see us? Where is mother? Aren't you going to help her? - The taxi man will take care of her. Take this and settle up. There's a good girl. I can't out like this. Go on. Don't stand staring at me. Rita. Quick. That way. Through the garden gate at the end and hurry yourself up. Who was that? Madame Collins? Oh yes. She came round looking for business. She wants mother to get things there. She's not much good. How do you mean? Well, she's not a very nice woman, Winnie. I wouldn't say anything to mother if I were you. It might worry her. She might think she ought to go there for her things. Hello, dear. - Hello. Well, it was a very good train this evening. We thought tomorrow being Saturday that we ought to .. Put them right down there please. That's it. Thank you very much. Well, have you really been getting on alright? I've been worried about you. Wondering if .. Good gracious, what a litter. Oh, it's dreadful you being here like this. I knew I ought never to have gone. - I've been alright. Have you had a good time? - Oh, a lovely time, Will. We made such nice friends. Winnie got an invitation to stay with them in the country. Was the hotel alright? It was a beautiful place. Wasn't it, Winnie. Quite decent. Look. I brought you some postcards. There is the ballroom. Will, have you heard anything from Mr Medland? Medland? No. Why? Nothing. Only I found this in the hotel this morning. What is it? - An advertisement. Lawyers asking for information as to the whereabouts of James Colville Medland. It is from Australia and I thought it might be our Mr Medland. Do you think it is the one? Funny, isn't it? The same name and from Australia. I thought you might know where he was. - How should I know? I thought he might have called on you while we were away. Well, he hasn't. Besides lawyers wouldn't want to advertise. For Jim. They could get into his bank. He hasn't come to see us again and I do not see why you should bother with him! I'll hear all your news when I come down. I'll just go and tidy up for a bit. Mum. Do you think he is alright? In the head I mean. Whatever do you mean? - Well, he never used to be like this. Drinking and getting into violent tempers over the least little thing. He gets like that every time you mention Mr Medland. Why should he get so worked up about it? And these books he reads. Good gracious. If reading a book means a person isn't right in the head .. Yes, mum. But they are not ordinary books. They are sort-of weird things. "Death is almost instantaneous." What book is that? It is about being poisoned. By cyanide. Cyanide? "After death the body often retains the appearance of life .." "With the cheeks being red and the skin .." My goodness. That is enough to send anyone dotty, reading stuff like that. Listen. - No. I don't want to hear it. I didn't know he was reading books like this. That is his favourite place judging from the thumb marks all over the page. I can't understand. It is nonsense. You run upstairs and start getting unpacked. I'll be up in a minute. That's a good girl. Will. No. No! No! Did you shut the gate? No. Will, I can't. What, dear? I can't go out there anymore. Alright, dear. How much are you spending a week now, Annie? About three pounds I suppose. Maybe a little more. Why, dear? I was only thinking, it is funny isn't it how badly we wanted money. We haven't got much out of it have we. A fat lot of use it has been really. Except it has given Winnie a good start. I'm not even sure about that. Will. She is not the same girl. She'll be looking down on us directly. You see if she doesn't. These people she has gone to stay with. They are not our sort, Annie. Well, they have given her a lovely time, dear. We can't do much for her here. What time does she get here? She ought to be here any minute now. Annie. We get on alright alone. These last three weeks since she's been away we've been alright, haven't we. We don't want anyone else. Yes. But Will, this is her home. I know. All the same, just lately it has been different. More like it used to be. What's the matter, dear? Will, after all .. After all this time, it .. It is so wonderful. I am almost glad that it happened. You have been fine, Annie. No. It has been a sort of help, you knowing. It was having it all to myself that made me so bad. Things kept cropping up and scaring me stiff. Yes. Annie. We haven't talked about it. We ought to really. Supposing something happens suddenly? Please, Will. Don't go on like this. The chances do get less of course. But we can never be absolutely sure. Sometimes I forget for quite a long time. Then something happens. A knock on the door or something. And I think they have come for me. Please don't, Will. [ Door knocks ] That's Winnie now. Hello, Winnie. Well I am glad. Such a night. Come to the fire. Hello Dad. Enjoyed yourself? - A lovely time, thanks. I hope there's something nice to eat. Pig, eh? No salad? I am afraid we don't eat very much, dear. You mean to say you old dears have been solemnly munching pig without any salad? I say, mum. Haven't you got a younger loaf? Why, what is the matter with it? It's a little tired. That's all. We are not so particular. Particular? Oh well. I had a lovely tea anyway. What is that, may I ask? This? Only my cigarette case. Why? Winnie. Do you smoke cigarettes? Yes. Cigars don't agree with me. Now then, there's no need to be rude. Winnie, don't you think you are too young? Good heavens, the minute I get home. Two to one! Look here, Winnie. For goodness sake leave me alone. - You mustn't be rude to your mother. Mother? You want to tell me how to behave toward mother? Look, young lady. We have it peaceful here and I will not quarrel with you. But I won't stand for your new manners. These fashionable new friends of yours who I haven't the pleasure of knowing. It's not their fault if you don't know them. I can't invite them to this hole. What did you say? You don't expect me to have them here do you? And let them see our fine home and beautiful furniture. Furniture? Why, what's wrong with it? Wrong? Stop that. My sainted aunt wrong. You little snob. Well, we can afford a decent home. We don't have to stay in this pigsty. Stop it. I am never leaving this house. You don't care what happens to me. You are mean and selfish. You would like me to be as common as you are. You little .. beast. How dare you. How dare you touch me. You'll never see me again. You haven't wanted me here for some time because I know you and what you are. You and that French woman Madam Collins. - Shut up. I won't shut up. She was here when we came back from Bournemouth. You know she was. She was upstairs in the bedroom. You go to your room! I will teach you. You're afraid. You are afraid of mother knowing. Ask him why he won't leave here. Ask him about that French woman Madam Collins. You young devil. - Please Will. Don't. She didn't mean it, dear. It isn't like here. Really it isn't. Where has she gone? - Up to her room I expect. Come and sit down, Will. It is no use upsetting yourself like this. Don't, dear. Please don't. I'll just go and see what she is doing. Winnie. Winnie. Will. Will. She's gone. Gone. - Gone? Yes, her bag is gone. I put it there. Oh, Will. She'll be back, Annie. Don't you fret. - Oh, no she won't. She won't! Annie! Annie! Feel better now? Yes. Thank you, dear. This cocoa will make you sleep. Don't bother, Will. I really couldn't touch it. Don't you fret, Annie. She's probably gone back to her swagger friends. Will. - Yes, dear? What made her say that about Madam Collins? She didn't know what she was saying. She was talking wild. Whatever made her think of Madam Collins? She would say anything. She must have had some reason. If she had, I don't know anything about it. Will. Yes? You have never met her, have you? Of course not. You don't think I would let you down, Annie? I know you wouldn't really but .. Will. I couldn't bear to think that you had been untrue to me. If I thought that I .. I don't think I could go on. I would kill myself. Don't, Annie. Don't. Annie. There never has been anything. I swear. Oh. I know there hasn't really. Now drink it all up. That's right. Feeling better today, aren't you. Your forehead is cooler. I must go across the street to get some more oranges. You try and get a little nap. Hello Will. A dozen oranges, Mr Evans. The best. - Fine. How is she? - Better, thanks. Glad to hear it. She's been pretty sick, hasn't she. - Yes. She got wet through you know. Traipsing after our girl that day. I suppose you have somebody in to help? - No. Well, who is doing all the housework and the nursing and everything? I am. It's a wonder the doctors didn't say you had to have a nurse. He did at first but Annie wanted me. My word. No wonder you look all done in. It was awful, Charlie. At one time, about nine one night .. I thought she was going. But she is better. She's not well yet of course, but she is better. No doubt about it. Here you are. - Oh, thank you. Is there anything I can do to help? No, no, Charlie. Thank you. But if there is I'll let you know. It's a blooming shame. Bonjour, Cheri. - Rita, what do you want? I'll tell you inside. - No, you can't come in here. I can't? Open the door or I .. - Shush. Don't make a noise. You must go at once. My wife is ill. Terribly ill. - What? She mustn't know you're here. It will upset her. So you are so fond of her now, huh? Yes, I am. - What? That old bundle of rags. Keep your filthy mouth shut. You will not talk about her. You're not fit to. She is worth fifty of you any day. - Oh yes, I am sure. Yes, she is. If you have more to say .. - I have only this to say. I must have 500 pounds. You dirty little blackmailer. You're not getting another penny out of me. - No? I might have to tell your wife about the three weeks she was at Bournemouth. You couldn't. She wouldn't believe you. Besides, she is ill I tell you. A shock like that. So. You have found out nothing, huh? Thank you. That was just what I wanted to find out. You little swine. 500 pounds please. I should ask for much more. Only I remember how much I loved you once. You are as hard as nails, aren't you. You didn't used to think so once. When I think I could have ever wanted you it makes me feel sick. Ah, but I shall never forget. I think of all the afternoons when you sit in your old chair waiting for me. And then I creep in and put my hands over your eyes. You just out of your chair and hold me in your arms. And give me a long, long kiss. Do you think I should ever forget that, huh? Who is that? - What? It sounded like the door. No. It is shut. [ Door knocks ] Get out. It's the doctor. He can't find you here. - But that is not polite: "get out". I must go to the door. You go the back way and don't let anyone see you. Get out. Au revoir, Cheri. Hello, doctor. - You didn't hear my first knock? No. Well, everything alright? - Oh yes. Quite. I thought she might be worse. You look flustered. As a matter of fact she's a bit brighter today. She's had her lunch? - Yes. I fetched her tray down about half an hour ago. She was going to have a doze. Did she like the fruit juice? - Yes, she did. Give her as much of it as she will take. - I was just going to make some more. What about you? Me? You don't look too good you know. Did you take a chair into the garden as I told you to? No. Not yet, doctor. I haven't had much time. Well, look after yourself or you will get a nurse whether you like it or not. Anything the matter, doctor? - Yes. Is she bad again? She is dead. How can she be? It can only just have happened. Not more than a couple of minutes I should say. It is extraordinary. Dead, did you say? She appears to have been poisoned. What? Is there any poison in the house? No. At least not where she could get it. Why? What is it? Cyanide of potassium? Yes. It is cyanide. I need it for photography. I've had it for some time. Where? Out there in the cupboard. She couldn't have got it possibly. Annie. Annie. Annie. Annie. Annie. Annie. Annie. Was this the one? Yes. But it was half full. When did you give her the fruit juice? About three quarters of an hour ago. Why? Did you see her drink it? Yes. There couldn't possibly have been anything in that. I took it up .. And didn't leave until I brought the glass down with the other things. Where is that glass? Annie. Our there in the cupboard. I will show you. It was there on the tray. I know it was. Did you take it? Doctor. She couldn't have got down alone. No. Well. But how did that glass get upstairs? That is what I want to know. Marble. Why did you kill your wife? Hello, Winnie. Father. Father. Oh, Daddy. Daddy .. Daddy. There. Don't cry, girlie. Don't cry. Winnie, darling. Don't cry. I've been sitting here thinking about you. Funny, the things that come into your mind. Do you remember the first day you were at school? You had a little pair of lace boots. And proud as punch you were going off so grown up. Mother cried. We were losing our baby. But you were always our baby. Even when .. - Oh, Daddy. I hurt her so. If I had only come home. If I had only written before. I know, Winnie. I know. I did love her. I loved her. Yes, dear. That is the strange part of it. Father. You. You didn't do it? Not .. not mother. You couldn't. I didn't do it, Winnie. In a few hours, this is the last time. I want you to be sure. - Oh Daddy, I am. I am. I can't give up hope even now. Surely there is something we can do? It is better as it is, dear. - Daddy, how can you say that? I've gone through a good deal, Winnie. But I am at peace now. Whatever I have done. I am going to pay. - Daddy. It is funny, isn't it. How one thing leads to another. We think we can escape payment. But sooner or later. It is a kind of relief, almost. Even though .. - Daddy, Daddy. I've been a poor sort of father to you. No, no. No, you haven't. My Daddy. Don't cry so. Don't cry. Don't. I am not afraid. It is just a step. And if there is trouble ahead mother will put in a word for me. l will .. I will be praying for you. Every moment. That's right, girlie. I'll be thinking of that. It will be like as if you are holding my hand. Until maybe I can reach hers. [ Door opens ] Shush. Annie. Annie. (-tg--)-
