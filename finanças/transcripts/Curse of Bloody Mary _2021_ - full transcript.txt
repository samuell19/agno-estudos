You! You filthy whore! Satan's lust has overtaken you and you've disobeyed your own God with this, this hobby! No, don't! No, Matthew, please don't! Now, you've gone against the will of God and in the Bible it says woman shall not lie with woman! So now I wonder how many other times you've committed such a filthy act. I swear Matthew, this is the only time. Now why don't I believe you? You're a temptress and sin follows you everywhere. I was blind with lust to think that you could ever be a faithful, God-fearing woman! But now, now I see you for the untrustworthy whore that you are. And I shall cast out the foul demons and I'll free you of your sin. - No, I have your baby! - Baby! May God have mercy on your soul, for your adulterous behavior. You carry no child of mine! You and your demon spawn will burn in hell! Here take a long look in the mirror. See what your beauty has done for you. I curse you, I curse you Matthew Elias for what you have done to me and my child. I will haunt you and your family for all of eternity! I curse you. ♪ Mary ♪ ♪ Mary ♪ ♪ Mary ♪ ♪ Mary ♪ ♪ Don't look in the mirror ♪ ♪ I couldn't been clearer ♪ ♪ If you even see a it'll be the end of you ♪ ♪ Don't matter if you can fight ♪ ♪ Even with all your might ♪ ♪ It's almost midnight so don't go in the bathroom ♪ ♪ Bloody Mary bloody Mary bloody Mary ♪ ♪ I believe in bloody Mary ♪ ♪ Bloody Mary bloody Mary bloody Mary ♪ ♪ I believe in bloody Mary ♪ ♪ Bloody Mary bloody Mary bloody Mary ♪ ♪ I believe in bloody Mary ♪ ♪ Bloody Mary bloody Mary bloody Mary ♪ ♪ I believe in the legend ♪ ♪ Oh the legend of Mary whoa ♪ ♪ You think this is just a game ♪ ♪ You think she's some kind of dream ♪ ♪ You will never see the light of day ♪ ♪ 'Cause she will be in the end of you ♪ ♪ Don't turn the lights out ♪ ♪ Believe me there's no doubt ♪ ♪ You won't have time to pound ♪ ♪ So don't go in the bathroom ♪ ♪ Bloody Mary bloody Mary bloody Mary ♪ ♪ I believe in bloody Mary ♪ ♪ Bloody Mary bloody Mary bloody Mary ♪ ♪ I believe in bloody Mary ♪ ♪ Bloody Mary bloody Mary bloody Mary ♪ ♪ I believe in bloody Mary ♪ ♪ Bloody Mary bloody Mary bloody Mary ♪ ♪ Whoa I believe in the legend ♪ ♪ Oh the legend of Mary whoa ♪ ♪ Mary ♪ ♪ Mary ♪ ♪ Mary ♪ - Is this the place? - Yep.

I know just think in a few hours, we'll finally get to meet Matt Elias, I can't wait! Me neither. Do you think he'll actually put us in the movie? Why not, look at us, we're hotter than most girls they put in videos. I guess, I just hope we don't get into trouble. Please, it's not like we're hurting anybody.

You ever heard of the curse of Mary Worth? No, is it like a ghost story? Sort of. Okay, in the early 1900s a young, beautiful woman named Mary Worth was married to an evangelist. He was a very jealous man and constantly worried that because of her beauty, she'd be unfaithful to him. You, you filthy whores! No, Matthew please don't! No, I have your baby! You and your demon spawn will burn in hell! Take a long look in the mirror, see what your beauty has done for you. I curse you, I curse you Matthew Elias for what you have done to me and my child. I will haunt you and your family for all of eternity. I curse you. Whoa, that's intense. Do you think it could be true? Oh, I know it is, I've seen her. What do you mean you've seen her, like in a picture or something? - No, a picture, her reflection. If you close your eyes and stand in the dark in front of a mirror and say bloody Mary three times, when you open your eyes, she'll be standing next to you in the mirror. - Really? - It's true and if you're not afraid, she'll show you your future. But if you get scared, she'll kill you. Oh come on, really it can't be true. Believe what you want, I know what I saw. I don't believe you but you really had me going there for a second. I'll give it to you, it was a really good story. Okay, so why don't you give it a shot, I mean, if you don't believe it. - Me, no, I don't think so. - Come on, what's wrong, you chicken? - No, I just don't care for it that much. Right, just what I thought, you're all talk. What? You talk tough but when it comes down to it, you always chicken out. - About what, this? Yeah, this and everything else. Huh, you wouldn't even be here if I didn't talk you into it. Okay, fine, I'll do it. Go on. Bloody Mary, bloody Mary, - Bloody Mary, bloody Mary, bloody Mary. Bloody Mary.

No, I was actually just heading out the door. Okay, well, I just wanted to see what you were up to today. I'm gonna be heading your way later and I thought we could for to lunch and talk. I can't today, Mom, I got a shoot this afternoon. Oh, you're still doing that, huh? Yes, Mom, this is what I do. You may not understand but this is a win for me. I know but you could do so much more and still do your acting thing on the side. Look, Mom, I told you, it may not be your dream but it's mine. If I don't do this now, I may never get a chance to. Besides, it's not like I can't go to school a year from now. My credits will still be good to get me into the program. - I know, I just. - Look, just one more semester okay? - Okay, but only if that's what you wanna do. - Yes, it is. - Okay. Listen, I'm running late, I gotta go, I'll talk to you later okay? All right, honey, we'll talk later, I love you. - I love you too, bye. - Bye. Come on, come on, we've only got a few short hours to get this thing shot. All right, all right, the talent isn't even here yet, so don't worry. We'll get the gear ready. I swear to god he better get here. Who, Weed, oh, don't worry about it, he'll be here. He may be a lot of things but he loves this shit. He wouldn't miss this shoot for the world. I hope you're right, otherwise you and I will be directing this thing. Great. Oh, here comes Chet. What the fuck is this? How are you even gonna pretend that this is gonna work for the shoot, huh? Matt is a star okay, a fucking star and it's about time you started recognizing that. Hi, Chet, it's great to see you too. It's gonna be fine trust me. It may not look like it from here, but it's gonna go great, you'll see. This place has character. Yeah, yeah, character, huh? Whatever, it looks cheap is all. Well, it is cheap, but whose fault is that? What are you trying to say? I'm just saying that I only have so much money to work with 'cause you control the checkbook. If you want a million dollar video, you have to pay for it. Huh, you got balls I'll give you that. Now I just hope you can make this work. Can you? Don't worry, I've got it covered. As a matter of fact here comes your award winner director now. Great this just keeps getting better. I got a shit location and a stoner for a director. Chet, he's the best in the business and you know it. When you can get him to work maybe but. Yeah, but look, he's here now, that's a good sign, right? I suppose. Hey, Weed how's it going? A lot better now baby, how you doing? I'm fine, look I need to introduce you to our music producer, Chet Wood. Chet Wood? Yeah, right on, lead the way. Ooh. - Weed? - Yeah? This is Chet Wood and Chet this is Weed Bryson. S'up bro, nice to be meeting you. Likewise, we actually met before. Oh yeah, you know I am not real good with names, I tend to forget things from time to time, you know what I mean? Yeah, I understand, it has been awhile, maybe two, three years ago. Whoa, yeah, there's no way, man but you know what it's cool. I mean, we're gonna have a great time and shoot a fucking awesome video, right? Let's get started, huh, what do you say? What about Matt? Oh, he'll just meet us later, we have a lot to go over anyway, let's just go inside. Mm. Well, hello Mrs. Page, how are you today? Hey, Mike, how you doing? - Oh, I'm doing good. - That's good. I hope you have a great shoot today. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Break a leg. - Hmm-mm. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey there, Mr. Wood, who's this? She's with me Tweedledum. She's not on the list, Mr. Wood, if she's not on the list, she can't come in. It's a closed set. It says right here, Mr. Chet Wood but there's no plus one. And if you don't have a plus one that means you can't have a plus one and she would be a plus one, so she can't come in. I don't give a shit what your list says you nitwit! This is my shoot and we're going in. No, you're not going in 'cause that would be against the rules. This is a closed set, she can't come in. Listen, moron, what's it gonna take for you to let us in? Well, I guess I could just search all of your orifices to make sure you're not hiding anything, you know, up there deep. Mike, is there a problem? Oh, no problem at all Mrs. Page. Mr. Wood and his gal pal were just about to come in, right guys? You guys wouldn't wanna be late for your own shoot, right, that wouldn't be professional. That is very nice, very, very nice. Boop. Ass wipe. Go fuck yourself! Would you just shut up! See, see you were with her last night, weren't you? Yeah, so what if I was, you weren't there. That is no excuse, that gives you no right to cheat on me! - Hello, Mr. Elias. - Hey, man, what's up? Not much. Look, I didn't cheat on you, it was just a fucking blow job. Yeah, a blow job. Let me tell you, some really cool dudes have passed through these walls. Man, if walls could talk, ooh. That's all well and good, Alan but right now we've got a video to shoot and here's the man of the hour right now. Hey, man, how's it going? Where can I even get ready? - Right in there. Hey, Matt, this is Alan Sussex, he's the manager here at Sound Mall. Cool, man, nice place you got here. I've heard great things about it. Yeah, great. Where's the bar? Oh, we have no bar but we've got a couple of drinks on the table right over there. Okay. So, Alan, where's the dressing room, I need to get ready. Right over there, okay, please make yourself at home, anything you need just let me know, okay, just holler. Thanks. Boy, the kids today, always in such a rush, you know? Back in the day, work was the last thing on their minds, if you know what I mean. Yeah, look, we really need to get started, so if you'll just excuse us, we'll just. Oh, go, oh, yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah. Hey, listen, anything you need, you just let me know. I'll just be hanging around. All right hey thanks, Alan, I appreciate it buddy. Hey, you're late! Sorry, sorry, I had a call from my mom as I was heading out and. Well, just go get ready. It'll just be a couple of minutes. Jesus fine go, good god, what else is gonna go wrong today? Come on people we got a video to shoot! Let's go, kick it up a notch! What a dump. Whoa, who are you? - I'm your biggest fan. - Oh, yeah. I've been looking for you for a long time. What the hell, where'd she go? Dude, you got this, right? Sure, why? I mean, well, I kinda wanna take a little smoke break if you know what I mean. Oh, oh, oh, yeah, sure go ahead, man, I'll take care of this. Are you sure, I mean, you're cool with this, right? Yeah, no problem. Thanks, you're awesome dude. - Whoa. - Oh, hey. And who might you be? Oh, the girl in the video. Oh, oh, yeah. You know, the video I'm going to be in after we. - Don't worry, it's cool. So, what's up? You wanna have some fun? Actually I was just looking for the dressing room, I need to change into my clothes. Cool, maybe later. Feel free to use this one. I think it's the only one in this dump anyway. Whoa. Oh my god. That's what I'm talking about. Hey, baby, how you doing? Who are you? - I'm Mary. - Mary, so you a fan or something? Yeah, something like that. Yeah, I like that, I do, yeah. So, I hear Matthew Elias is shooting a video. - Matt, huh? - I'm a big fan. Figures, you know, you know, I'm the real talent here. I'm sure you are. So, you want me to get you into the shoot. Please. Sure, no problem, I can make it happen, you know, I'm the director, I can make it happen. So, I get a little, just a little taste. - Maybe later, baby. - Later, right later. So, yeah. - Yeah, dude, we have some shooting video. Shooting, after you. I'll blow your fucking head off, bitch. The motherfuckers. Mike, put that gun away! Jesus! - Oh, sorry, Mrs. Page. Thanks. You look like you can use a beer and some company. Yeah, it's kinda been one of those days. We all have those kind of days. Sometimes you just have to kick the feet up, lie back and take it easy and slow things down a little bit. Ain't that the truth. I just feel like we've been constantly running around and I really don't know where we're going. Where's Alan? He's upstairs but I gotta warn you, he's alone with Sky. - So? - Well, everybody knows he's a pretty big dick. - Whatever, whatever. ♪ Open your hands and then lay down your love ♪ ♪ Lay down your love ♪ ♪ That boom boom baby banging on my ribcage ♪ ♪ Lay down your love ♪ ♪ Do you feel that boom boom baby banging on my ribcage ♪ ♪ Oh oh my ribcage ♪ ♪ Boom boom baby banging on my ribcage ♪ ♪ Do you feel that boom boom baby banging on my ribcage ♪ ♪ Just don't stop. ♪ ♪ On on my ribcage ♪ ♪ Just don't stop ♪ ♪ On on my ribcage ♪ ♪ Just don't stop ♪ ♪ Baby just don't stop ♪ Finally, come here, let's get a look at you. - Yeah? - Huh-uh. All right, get up there, come on, chop, chop. - Ooh. - Bitch. Yeah, she's a piece of work, isn't she? You know you might be all right after all old man. - Old man. - Yeah. Oh. All right, let's get rolling. Okay, where's the director, let's get on with this. Christ, has anyone seen Weed? Well, I guess this is what happens when you hire Tommy Chong to direct a video. He's cool, he's just getting his head together. Yeah, right. Frankie, will you hurry him with it please? - Yeah, sure, I'm on it. - Thank you. And who the hell is this? We have enough non-performing snatch on this set, don't you think? Producers, they think they run the whole show. Chill, Janet, she's cool, I mean, she's with me, huh? Her name is um. - Mary. Whatever, just stay the hell out of the way, okay? All right, all right. We need to get going like yesterday. Come on, Weed. I'm on it, I'm going baby, yo. Actually I think Tommy Chong would be a step up from this guy. Chet, you hired me because you know I can get the job done, right? We needed something quick and cheap, for some reason I thought of you. Make sure your bimbo has your balls hold tight, okay, or they might disappear. Cool, all right, just like we talked about. All right, quiet on set everyone! All right, we are rolling. - What the hell's this? - It's cool. This happens from time to time, I'm on it. Let me go find Alan. Jesus, Janet, could you have picked a worse location? Look, the label said that we needed to get this video like yesterday, okay? I mean, with the director that I hired and the location, it's gonna work perfectly, okay? You know, I don't see why everyone thinks this damn stoner is such a genius. Weed is the only thing that's good about this, okay? His skill level is tight and he'll get this video done, okay? Alan said 10 to 15 minutes. Okay, let's just take a quick break. Screw this, I'm getting something to eat. We have plenty of food on the, services here. - Yeah, right, like I'm gonna eat that shit. Come on, babe. Say something. Hey, hey, Matt, be back in 30. It'll be fine, he'll be back in an hour. Oh Jesus. - This is bullshit. - Yeah. Well, I guess I'll have to spend a couple bucks more to keep the lights on in this joint, what is this? Chet, I could just kill you. - Oh really? - Hmm-mm. No, you will not. Where is Alan anyway? - Turkey neck bastard. This is my studio, why can't I be a rock star? I mean, how tough is it? Yeah. Just, show a bicep, suck in the gut. Ah, bummer, will you look at that, I broke a string. Some rock star. Ah, man, man. Old trusty harmonica, suck in the gut, bicep, harmonica. Wow, I didn't know you were up there. My hearing isn't what it used to be. Yeah, I was just coming to see what you were up to. Well, I'm up to rock and roll and music. Here, maybe you can help me. Can you try and find this string and put it on there. It fell and broke. - Sure. Thanks. So, what is your name? - Mary. Oh, "Mary Had a Little Lamb." Mary what? - Mary Worth. Oh, nice name. Got any boyfriends or husbands? No, not anymore. Hmm, you should. Got any kind of hobbies or things you like you to do or, you like sports? I'm not really into sports. You a stay at home girl, you cook? Yeah, I like to cook. Nice, hey, what are you doing? What is it, why are you always such a bitch? This is a big day for me, you should be happy. Well, maybe I would be if you hadn't had your dick in someone else's mouth last night. Is that what's really bothering you? Of course, that's what's bothering me. How would you feel if another guy went down on me last night? I'd tell you to hit the damn road. Then that's exactly what I should tell you. Oh, that's bull, it's different. How is that? Because anytime you wanna jump on me I'm ready and willing. If I wasn't then maybe you'd have an excuse to cheat on me. But what you need to realize is that when I wanna get my rocks off, I will and if you don't wanna do it, I'll just find somebody that will. You really have nobody to blame but yourself. Stupid bitch. Why do you do this to yourself? - Shit. - Sorry, I didn't know anyone was in here. It's okay, I was all done. I didn't mean to scare you, I just thought the door was jammed. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna tap that tonight. Hey, Matt, I was able to move some things around in our schedule and I think we can get started in the studio laying down some rough tracks in about six months for your new album. I know the label doesn't need it for another year but I was thinking. - Hey, Chet, I know the great Mr. Matthew Elias III wanted to wait till he had his contracts and figures all lined up before he broke the news but has he even hinted at, I mean, even just a little bit that he's planning on going with another producer for his new album. What, yeah, right. Hey Matt, your girlfriend's drunk. She doesn't know what she's talking about, right? - Hey. - I mean, oh, you're not really considering this are you? I made you, you know that, right? Before me you were nothing more than a little punk front man in a shitty bar band. You have me to thank for your whole career. Yeah, yeah, well, now I'm the next big thing and my second album's gonna be the most anticipated record of the decade. So, I think that means, I call the shots now. Let's get to work. Son of the bitch! That little prick thinks he can leave me. I'll show him. Nobody leaves me, the great Chet Wood. - Hi. - Hi, yourself. - Having a bad day? - You have no idea. Oh, you'd be amazed at what I know and what I can do for you. - Really, like what? - A little of this and a little of that. - Really? Well, my problem is Matt Elias and his bitch girlfriend. Can you help me with that? Yes, they'll no longer be of any of your concern when I'm through with them. What are you talking about, killing them? Wait a minute, if he was gone, that would make his current album worth a fortune. Don't try to pretend you haven't thought of it. Yeah, but I would never in a million years. Chet I know the dark desires of your cold, black heart. Don't try to hide them from me. You've crushed 100 souls to get to where you are and now, now you need me. All I need is one little favor from you. What? Matthew Elias is wearing a necklace and I want it. A necklace, he wears a lot of crap around his neck. Look, if it's jewelry baby, I can make that happen. We could take a ride. - It has to be this one. - Okay, okay, if it's a family heirloom or something, why don't you just talk to him and get it back? It has to be this one and he won't give it freely. It's become a family heirloom to him too. What he doesn't know is his grandfather stole it from my family many years ago and I thought it was gone forever until I saw it today. If you could do this for me, I'd be forever in your debt. I can make all of your darkest desires come true. All you have to do is call me when you're ready. I don't even know your name. Mary, bloody Mary. There you are, Mr. Wood. I've been looking all over the place for you, Mrs. Page needs you. Can't you see I'm talking to someone here? I'll be there in a minute when I'm done in here, got it? - Who are you talking to? - Mary. There's nobody in here. - I swear to god, I was just. - Mr. Wood, it's all right, I understand you're under lot of stress with this video shoot and I can understand how you could get like this. Now listen, I'm gonna get you some soothing music and a glass of water and you can chill down, you're gonna be all right. Yeah, thanks there has been a lot going on. You know, just remember, Mr. Wood, I'm here to help. Anything you need, anything, just let me know. - Thank you, Mike. - Yes, I'm here to help, just don't forget that. - And I'm actually sorry about earlier, I'm sorry about all that. Let's just get back to the set. - That's all right. - Let's just get back to set. - We're now friends. - Yeah, go, go. - Hey. - Shouldn't you be on stage helping get this thing started? Janet wants to talk to Chet first, so who knows how long it'll be before we actually get started. Great, another hurry up and wait shoot. I can't tell you how happy I am about that. I'm right there with you. There's nothing I'd rather do, just shoot and move on, I hate all this bureaucratic shit. Me too, I mean, what happened to the good old days where you know, you could just scrap together a video? Might have sounded and looked like shit but it was ours. - Mm. - Now it's about what sells. - That's what pays the bills. Yeah. He's just changed so much in such a short amount of time. Sorry, I have no idea why I'm telling you this. Oh, it's cool, I understand, really, I do. But I'm afraid it's too late, he ain't coming back. Thanks, that makes me feel a lot better. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean it like that, I just meant, he's only gonna get bigger, he's gonna be huge. Yeah, I just don't know if I'm part of that plan. I wished I could say. I've seen it go both ways. - Hey, work? - I need to go, I'll talk to you later. - Later. - Work, man. - Good luck. Yeah. Yo, I don't care what stupid vision you idiots have for this video. Matt, come on, if Weed says it'll look better, we should try it. He knows what he's doing. Dude, come on, it's not that big of a deal right? It's not that big of a deal? This is part of my whole look, my identity. Just like my hair, my clothes, and my music, this is what makes me, me and this is what my fans want, not some watered down, stripped down loser. No, man, nobody's calling you a loser. Chill out, man, it's about stripping away the material things. That's why we're filming in this fucking empty warehouse. Man, this warehouse, this represents your freaking empty soul. These windows are your fucking prison, man. That is the message of the video. That is bullshit. Come on, Matt, let's just try it, if it's not working, we can reshoot it. We just need to get started, we're burning too much time here. Time, I don't give a shit about your time, my time is all that matters here and don't either of you forget it. Look, you deal with this shit, 'cause I'm taking a break. Oh my, come on Matt, we don't have time for this. Shit. This is bullshit. I shouldn't have to put up with this shit. Don't worry, babe, it's not gonna last forever. Don't you think I know that. This is all just a formality, okay? Once I shoot this crappy little video, they'll back the truck up and start dumping out the cash. That's right, it's coming, these things just take time. It's just moving too fast. Too fast, hell things aren't moving fast enough if you ask me. There should be 20 people out there making this thing work. I'm talking about us. All of this is pulling us apart. Are you really still harping on that? Look, I'm sorry, okay, I just wasn't thinking. Yeah, you were, and you're just thinking with the wrong head. All right, all right fair enough. Look, things just get so blown up, it's hard to resist. Well, resist a little harder. None of this around us is real, what you and I have, that's real. Yeah, yeah, you're right. How the hell did all this happen anyway? - Power of the internet, baby. - Right. Relax, you'll feel better. So, what's going on, why aren't we shooting? Matt. What about him, huh? You know what, I don't care, just fix it. You, if you don't wanna work on this shoot then quit, got it. But it'd be so cool. What, what would be so cool, what are you wanting to do? All I want is for him to take his damn jewelry off. It'd make things 10 times cooler with the song and the location. I mean, hell, isn't the song about being broke and struggling? The bling is too flashy, dude, it needs to go, Weed out. Yeah, yeah. I can actually see that. You know what, that's actually a pretty good idea, Weed. Janet, what do you think? Oh, I think it's a great idea. That's why we've been trying to convince Matt. He's just not seeing it. Do you think you can talk him into it? Yeah, I think so, I mean, he's pretty attached to all that crap but yeah, I think the video would actually be better without it. Just give me a minute to talk to him and I'll be right back. All right, cool, man, we'll just be hanging. What just happened? Yo, Frank, have you seen Alan? Yes, no, not since he went downstairs to get the power turned back on. All right, well, go down there and see if you can find him and have some of these lights knocked out all right? We don't need them all anyway, it might give us some more power for our gear. That's a great idea. And Frank, while you're down there, make sure you have Alan show you how to put the power back on. If anything were to happen, I'd rather for you to take care of it. Sure, but why? Alan has his pace of doing things and we have ours. Yeah. I know I can count on you. Sure, I'm on it. Cool, man, you let me know, all right? Alan, Alan. What do you want me to do? Whatever, just take a break or something. Don't worry you're getting paid no matter what. Okay, I'll just go get some food. Yeah, whatever just go on. You need to chillax, babe, it'll be all right, you know, these things always tend to work themselves out in the end. Nothing's going right. If everything would start working out then maybe I could relax. Hey, I can help you with that. I know a little cure for the stress right here. Yeah, I need a hit. - Jesus! - What? What's going, what's wrong? What the hell's going on here? What are you talking, are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I thought I saw something. I thought I, it was, it was. You're just tired, that's all, it's okay. No, I'm fine. I just thought I saw that Mary chick but she was pretty messed up. It was just so real, like something in a movie. You're just stressed out, baby you're just stressed out. - Hey, sorry to interrupt. - No, you're not. You're right, I'm not. If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to Matt. Anything you've gotta say to me, you can say in front of her. Okay, I just wanted to say that I think Weed has a point. What are you talking about? The jewelry, I think the video would be better without it. Yeah, man, I don't know, my fans kind of expect all this. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, Matt, but in this instance, I think it makes more sense. You know, the music is raw, it's not the rock star lifestyle on display. You need to be basic. What do you think? I think the weasel has a point. I mean, if the video's gonna be raw, maybe you should be too. All right, all right, let's do this then. All right, here, I'll just hold onto it, that way you won't have to keep up with it. Okay, cool, man, thanks. Alan! Alan, you down here! Alan, you okay, man, where you at? Everybody upstairs is looking for you, Alan! Dude, you better not be down here staring at your goddamn lava lamp. Come on, man, that's it, we don't have time for this. Alan? Shit! Hey, did you find Alan? Hey guys. I see Chet talked you into the no jewelry idea. Yeah, I think I was making too much of it. But I think it'll work, don't you? Yeah, sure, looks great. What do you think, Sky? - Uh-huh. - Come on, Sky. What no, I'm fine, everything's cool, really. Okay. Let's shoot a music video, are you coming? Yeah, let's do this. Yeah, let's do this. You just zoom in here and then. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it, looking good, man. Whew. Wow, Matt, you look really good. How do you feel, you ready for this? Yeah, everything's fine, let's just do this already. I'm sorry but. What, what is it now? What could possibly be the problem? It's nothing, nobody has told me what to do yet? Oh for Christ's sakes all you have to do is sit there and listen to Matt, maybe do a little of this and a little of that, whatever it is that we hired you for. Do you think you can handle it? Yeah, I can handle it. You don't have to talk to me like that, I'm not some stupid bimbo. Okay, just do your job and we'll be fine, got it! Whoa, whoa, whoa, all right, look, give her a break, okay boss lady? Look, baby, come with me, all right, I'll show you where I need you okay, right over here. She's so smoking hot. Janet, you don't need to be like that. She'll be fine, just give her a chance, okay? Wow, Matt, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you had a soft spot for this girl. I barely know her, but I've just kinda had a revelation, I think you need to change a few things, you know, take a few steps back. Okay, so, are we good to go? Almost, I wanna wait for Chet. All right, he's on his way in right now. Why don't you just take your place and we'll get started, all right? Hey, babe, how are things going? - Good, how are you? - Where the hell did you come from? - The basement. The basement, what were you doing down in the basement? Just taking care of Frank, he's become a little bit of a thorn in my plans and I just couldn't have that. Do you have my amulet in there? Well, maybe but exactly what are you gonna do for me now? What do you want a demonstration or something? How about you and big tits meet me in the bathroom. Just call me when you're ready. Oh, okay. Ya, where the hell? Where the hell did Mary go? Come on, I've got something to show you. - Where are you going? - I'll be right back, I just, just get started without me! Come on! Jesus, what the hell's gotten into you? Shut up, there's something I wanna try here, it's either gonna work or it's not. - What, kinda kinky. - Shh, bloody Mary. What? Shh, shh, quiet. Bloody Mary, bloody Mary. - What the hell are you doing? Huh, what, I don't know. Okay, this is just a little too weird for me. I think I'm gonna take off. I'll see ya. Everything okay? Yeah, yeah, just fine. You got a little blood on your. - Huh, what? - Yeah. Oh, blood, it's nothing, it's. Oh, so, everything's going well, everything going now. - Everything's going good. - Great. - It's like a brand new bunch. - Great, super, that's great. Have you seen Frank? Frank, no, no, I haven't seen Frank at all. No, no, not since the, oh good, good then, everything looks great. - Hey, hey. - Looks like it's really working out, huh? - Are you sure you're okay? - Yeah, yeah, get over it, I'm fine. It just feels so good to get the blood pumping, it's so invigorating. Yeah, sure, who are you again? - Mary, Mary Worth. - Oh, well have you seen Frank? - Yeah, he's in the basement with Alan. - Well, he's supposed to be up here running the camera for Weed. I guess I'm gonna have to find them. Yeah, I guess they're having some kind of power issue down there and they thought they should take care of it now so there wouldn't be any delays later. Fuck it, man, that's not working and we've gotta attack this differently okay? What, I'm doing what you said. Well, that is not working then. Look, maybe it's the lights, all right, I'll just get Frank to readjust a couple of these lights. Yo, boss lady, where is Frank? He's downstairs looking for Alan. You need some help? - Oh, yeah. Hey, Sky, why don't you grab one of those lights for me, okay? - What, fuck you. Come on, I was just, why don't you just be a team player? A team player, lady I don't work for you, okay? - Okay, I was just trying. - What the hell are you doing? Don't order my girlfriend around like that, she's not one of your grunts. Just because you can't get your people working. - I was just trying to get. - Yeah, whatever, Sky, just hang out, you're not here to work. Look, I'll do it, there's no sense in everybody getting all worked up about this. Cool, thanks babe. No problem, I just thought I would do it for you. Oh, sure let the kiss ass do it, she'll do it anything. Go ahead run along. - Chill out, Sky. Oh fuck you, Chet. So who are you, I mean, you're not like the rest of those chicks. I'd like to think I've got a little more to offer, even on these days, you know? Don't worry, it'll happen, it just takes time. You gotta make your own luck in this business. It doesn't hurt to get a little help, though right? No, it doesn't hurt. You know, I like you, you got fire in you. How about getting me in one of your features then? One thing at a time, okay, this first. No problem, just keep me in mind, that's all I'm saying. All right. Hold that for me. Do you have my amulet? I upheld my end of the bargain, now it's time for you to uphold yours. Well, not everything is done now, is it, there's still a few loose ends. I'll take care of it as soon as I get that amulet. You can't take it, can you? What's in the bag? Just don't worry about it, just take care of this shoot okay? Fine, but who were you talking to? Are you blind, I'm, oh god, where did she go, where'd Mary go now? How the hell should I know, I'm trying to get things done around here, not babysit your bimbos. Wait Crystal, she's, I don't know. - Are you okay? - It's so horrible. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm just fine. - Oh god. - Nothing's wrong, just fine. - All right, sure but don't worry, okay? - Go, do the shoot. Shit. Stupid ass Chet, forget his madness. Only one dressing, what kind of studio is this? A cheap ass broken down one. - Oh, hi. - Hi. I don't think we've met before. Oh. I spilled some beer on me, so. So, why'd you change? I spilled something on myself too. - I'm Sky. - I'm Mary Worth. Mary Worth, have we met before, I feel like I know you. No, I think one of us would remember if we had. You aren't one of Matt's relatives, are you? Matt's grandfather had a wife named Mary but that would mean you're. Dead. Oh my gosh, are you all right? Oh my god! - Did you hear that? - No, I didn't hear anything. Well, I sure did, I'm going to check it out. No, don't, don't, just leave it. Leave it, what's the matter with you? - It's Mary, it'll be okay. - Mary, did she say her name was Mary Worth, like the one from the legend? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what she said but. Do you think they're related? Well, maybe but I wouldn't know. Doesn't Matt have something about that in his album? This is a publicity stunt, that's what it is. Is she his lead character? I don't know, I just don't, she didn't say anything to me about it. Well, something's going on, look around, where is everybody? Oh, no, don't go, oh god, everybody keep shooting, just keep shooting the video and she doesn't want anymore delays, she won't have it! She's not that unreasonable. What the hell is this? - Is that, is that blood? - Looks like it. - It's all over the doorknob. And you know something is going on, spill it Chet. I saw you leave that room and you know who's in there. Who's in there, Chet, who's in there? Who's in there, Chet? Where's Sky? Where, what have you done, man, where is she? Nothing, I didn't do anything. Sky, Sky! Where is she is, come on, is this about the contract? Look, we can work something out, just tell me you didn't do anything. - It's Mary, it's Mary. - What about her? She's doing all of this, it's all Mary. Yeah, dude, what'd you do? - Mary. - Look! Stupid Chet. Holy shit, dude! Damn it! Chet, give me my amulet. - Just give it to her, Chet! - Fuck! You should be the whole trinket's losing it's power by the minute. Give it to her! No, no! Then you ever imagined. Fucking, run, run, run! Get in here, get in here! Oh god! Oh shit, oh shit. Help me get this in front of the door. That should hold for a little while. Oh my god, this is bad. I don't know if we should pull it out. What, I've got a goddamn knife in my back, pull it out! Weed, give me a hand, hold her shoulder. Oh, yeah, dude sure. I'm sorry, sorry. Oh god. - Oh fuck. - Come on. - Way to go, Chet, you're a really fucking prince. I don't know what to do. How about telling us what the fuck's going on around here. She's Mary Worth, the real Mary Worth. Who's that? Bloody Mary. That's just a legend my dad fucking told me. Oh no, no, no, not just a legend, it's real and you're tied to her. - That's bullshit. It felt way worse to me man. No shit. Okay, what's the amulet got to do with it? She wants it. No shit, Sherlock, what we wanna fucking know is why? - Look, I don't know. - You don't know nothing. It doesn't matter, we just gotta get the fuck out of here. Give me the amulet. - Hell no, it's mine now. Give him the damn amulet, dude. Okay, we're all gonna die anyway. Now, let's get the fuck out of here. - Oh shit! - Oh! Gotcha. - No, no! - No, no! Oh shit! I think that's mine. Give me that amulet. Why should I give you the amulet? I'll make all your career dreams come true. It didn't work out too well for Chet. You're strong, he's weak. I'm not giving you the amulet. Oh no, oh no, fuck, fuck! You want it, take it bitch! Fucking bitch. Reflection, if you close your eyes and stand in the dark in front of a mirror and say bloody Mary three times. You will be amazed who's standing next to you in the mirror. And if you're not afraid, she'll show you your future. But if you get scared, she'll kill you. Matt! Is he dead? Yeah, he's gone. Hey, hey, come on, we gotta go. Come on, come with me. Come on, easy, easy, easy. I'm sorry dude. ♪ There's something about this beat ♪ Very sad inside of Hollywood today with the sudden death of rising rocker, Matt Elias during the shoot for his latest music video.
