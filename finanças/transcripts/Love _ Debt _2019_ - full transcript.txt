[dialing] [man] You've reached Improve your life Construction. Leave us a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. - [sighs] - [woman] The mailbox you have reached is full and cannot accept any new messages at this time. [soft music] - You want to swipe that again? It didn't go through. - Yeah. - [girl] I need to practice... - Next time I'm leaving you at home. - But I was just practicing... - Do you have another card? It was declined. [man] Everything you'll need to know about a person, you'll learn by reading their credit report. Henry Warner, married, three kids, good job, two leased cars, mortgage on the house, currently under construction. For years he paid his bills on time, never left anything on his credit cards. And then, six months ago, he stops making payments, to the bank, the credit cards, even to his kid's shrink. Chances are he lost his job and his wife doesn't even know it. Let's go. [man] Meanwhile, he's getting crushed on interest rates. Bank wants to foreclose on his home, the credit card companies want their money. He's running on fumes. Now our job is to do whatever it takes to get that money. You think you're up for it? In college I lent my roommate $300. When he didn't pay it back, I took a picture of him in the shower masturbating and I said I'd post it on Facebook if he didn't pay up. You're going to fit right in. You've got two weeks to close or I'll find someone else. Why do you think the wife doesn't know? He never stopped paying for her yoga classes. - Henry. - Scott. - Five bucks and I make it. - Come on, you can bet more than that. How about bam $10,000 in severance, fifteen-year-old scotch and power tie? - How about 200k and my job back? - I wish you could have your job back. I thought we were saving the company, not having a fire sale. Buddy, I originally signed up to work for you, not to teach Chinese people how to do our jobs. Six months. I worked here without a paycheck, six months, and this is what I get, a lousy 10k? Cheap bottle of scotch and an ugly tie? Actually the tie was my idea. [phone rings] This is Scott. No, I have time. What's up? [woman] Your mother called me stupid. Your parents are driving me crazy. You have to be present... [woman keeps complaining indistinctly] I want you to crush it while I'm away. So when they fire me, I can come back and work for you. [woman continues speaking] [Scott] Call me. [phone rings] - [harmonic playing] - Henry. You know what, I give up, I cannot track down this fucking contractor anymore. - I can't live in a disaster zone. - Mom. This is... not now, Trinity, please. - This is now all on you. You're in charge. - Mom. - Trinity, what? - Mom, stop. Mom, stop. Stop! - [tires screeching] - Okay. Okay. I see it. I see it, Trinity. Thank you so much. Honey, you were right. Mommy just needs a second and we will get right back on the road. [honking] [harmonica playing] Okay. Okay. Okay. [soft music] [screams] [honking] There got to be somebody there to loan you the money. I sympathize with you, but look, if I don't get a payment - then we both get in trouble. - [man] You know you all pay what you owe. Good afternoon. This is Roy Tucker from the Beaumont Collection Agency. I'm not the one who win up $7,000, sticking 50s in the strippers' ass cracks. [woman] Don't get upset, Mr. Owens. Can I call you Albert? I'm going to call you Albert. When can you make a payment? Next month? Exactly when next month? Good afternoon. This is Roy Tucker. Hello? No, I can't get off the phone till I get a date, man. [man] You know, you got to give me something. I mean just help me out just a little bit. Calling me a bitch isn't going to make this better? - Gary, are you listening to me? - [man] That guy... he once convinced a man to let him bang his wife. [man] Here's how it's going to happen. I'm going to call you back in one hour. And when I do, I want to hear some magical numbers because I'm done fucking with you. What's with the bike? All right. Follow me. [man] Now, you close the case, you get 30% of whatever you collect. Do the money dance, do the money dance, do the money dance. Of course, I get 50% of that and then you got to kick back another 20% to the house but you get to keep the rest. Now how much does this guy owe? - He owes $83567.25. - Eddie? That's $25,070 and some change. Less than 70%, equalling $7,500.21. Fuck. What are you, a bookie? This guy, I love this guy. Wait. So, that means when I close 10 cases, I'll be able to pay off my student loans. Hey, kid, bang your head against the wall. - I don't understand. - Go over and bang your head against that wall right there. - You mean this wall? - That wall, yeah. [bangs] [soft music] - You're bleeding. - No, I'm not. - There's a tack in your head. - And I can't walk, what's your point? Hey, you're the enemy and they want you to think you're the one who brought this house of shit down on them. - That's right. - If you want that money, you're going to have to bang your head against that - wall a trillion times to get it. - Tell him. Sooner or later, something's going to give and for your sake, it better be the wall. It better be the wall. You see this? This grows for bits right here. - I can't do it. - If you drink it, I will let you jump on my bed without asking. Mom, please don't make them drink that crap. - It's good for them. - Last time you gave Matty the shits for two weeks. - It smells. - [woman] Melissa! And does this smell thing stink? - This stinks. - No it doesn't. - [mother] I don't know how you live like this. - Well... the idiot contractor has disappeared off the face of the earth. - Well, they got deported. - It's like literally, literally good. [mother] Oh, that hard water is going to make your hands dry. - It's fine, mom. - You probably could use some moisturizer. - It's fine, mom. - I can't eat this. - I can't eat this. - Trinity, get your brother out of the car. - [Trinity] But nana said I have to... - Go. I definitely cannot eat... what even is this? Hold on. I'll call you right back. Wish me luck. Mom, is it really asking too much for you to buy me some things that I can actually eat? - This alone will kill them. - What? That is the only bread Matty will eat. Bleached with chlorine and benzene which causes cancer. You're trying to kill me? I can't believe you want me to have cancer and die. - Can you please just be helpful? - I thought I was. Chop. [phone ringing] - Hello. - [man] Hello, this is Travis Parker. - Is Henry Werner at home? - Warner, not Werner. Oh, sorry, ma'am. I think there's... - the As look like Es here. - Hey, stick to the script. I'm calling on behalf of the BCC Credit Collection. I don't care where you're calling from, for the thousandth time, we are on the Do Not Call List. Yes, ma'am. This isn't about... What part of Do Not Call do you people not understand? Is... may I please speak with Henry Warner? He died. Wow... Her husband died. Hey, they only owe 80 grand. You should hear what they say when they owe a 100. Make a note. That was Bill's desk. - Do you think I could change desks? - No. [soft music] Did you get the email I forwarded? I have stopped reading those emails. It's about a group of college kids peeing on a girl in a bathtub. Is there a reward for a missing child? I found this one outside by himself in the car. - It's been one of those days. - Matty, take a video. You just don't want your kids to think that getting peed on is normal. [Karen] I rest my case. - Hey, did you buy anything that I could actually eat right now? - Don't start. - I'm just really famished, to tide me over, a quick one. - [Karen] No, please. - Dad, the idiot contractor... - Please, I need you to take care of that for me. Well, last I checked actually I work every day although if you want to change jobs I'm sure we can come to some type of arrangement. Okay. Why not you take care of the kids all day and I will ignore your phone calls and pretend I don't have a family? I will consider your offer. I was just telling your wife that kids today, for whatever demented reason, think that peeing on a girl in a bathtub is normal. [Karen] My kids are smarter than that. [Henry] You're back and forth, you got to have control. - Don't encourage her. - I'm encouraging her to be a better hockey player. Back and forth. I'm saying you don't know what's going on out there. Ten-year-olds sexting naked pictures of themselves. Actually when I was 11 years old, I took a polaroid of myself naked and left it in the girls' locker at school. All the good things you have to look forward to, kids. - [broken glass] - Damn it, Trinity. - Stop playing with that fucking ball! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No. Go to your room. Okay, you guys. Time to get excited. Why? Because Jennifer Stinson just tweeted that she's getting breast implants. Well, good thing you are not Jennifer Stinson. - She is my role model. - I can just give you $20 so you could buy a better bra. You are disgusting, dad. Jesus, Henry. Forty dollars? Go set the table. I am not your slave! Oh, I wish I could find a man like you that didn't talk. You could learn something from him. They were talking about this on Dr. Oz. All you have to do is work with him. I work with him, Mom. Trust me. I work with him more than anyone. Okay. You don't want to listen, don't listen. Fine. [Karen] ...stop playing with that fucking ball. - Damn it, Trinity. Stop playing with that fucking ball. - Really? Really? - Damn it, Trinity. Stop playing with that fucking ball. - What? Damn it, Trinity. Stop playing with that fucking... She looks for ways to try and piss me off. You just can't let it get to you. [Karen] You could have said something. Well, she hates me and she's your mother. This is about you being there for me. Real happy I can count on you. [Melissa] Trinity, did you... [indistinct] [Trinity] Sorry. Sorry. [Melissa] You are disgusting. I know you are, I don't like you. [grunts] [Melissa] Did you know they cut the beaks off the chickens then force-feed them until they're ready to be slaughtered? Let's wrap it up. I don't want you keeping your sister up. She's asleep. - Trinity, are you asleep? - Yes. Ten more minutes. I want my own room, dad. We all do. Okay, buddy. You know what? Why not I just move in here with you? You know, just the men. We'll get race car beds, paint the walls like it's Daytona 500. Okay. There you are. Locked in. [sings] All right. [soft music] All right. Lights on. Lights off. Lights on. Lights off. Lights on. Lights off. Lights on. [music continues] [phone ringing] Hello, I'm sorry that your husband is dead. Hello. Hi. Hello. - Hello. - Yes. Can I just please speak with Henry Warner? - You got him. - Henry Robert Warner? Yeah, one and the same. Oh, wow. You're still alive. Yeah. That's right. Last time I checked. Not dead. This is Travis Parker. Sir, I'm calling on behalf of the Beaumont Credit Collection Agency. For quality assurances, I have to tell you that this call may be monitored and any information that you give may be used to collect a debt. Why is it that when batteries die, people don't throw out the old batteries? Instead they put them in a drawer with the new ones, like magically somehow now they're going to work? Now I can't figure out which are the old ones and which ones are the new ones and it's very annoying. Sir, do you understand the reason I'm calling? - I owe you money. - Yes, sir, A lot of money. - I don't have it. - Well, sir, may I remind you that failure to make a payment will result in the immediate reposition... You can read that entire old script to me all night, I'm still not going to have the money. Are you open to having a real conversation, I'm open to doing that. - I don't know. - You're not sure you're going to have a real conversation? Listen. I'm new here. And I called earlier and your wife said that you died so I didn't even know that you'd pick up the phone. I was a little surprised but... and I'm new here so I don't... I said that already. There's just... there's a lot of stuff - on my mind and I'm a little confused. - Travis, take a deep breath. - Deep breath? - Take a deep breath, Travis. Just take a deep breath. It gets you through it. - Yes sir. - Normally I would hang the phone up, but I have had a shitty day and it sounds like you're having a shitty day and there's no point both of us having a shitty day so I'm going to help. Thanks. You need your money, I want to pay. - That's great. - Just not tonight. - Tomorrow? - No, probably not tomorrow, Travis, because the assholes that I work for... worked for just sold the company to the Chinese. Chinese like the China Chinese? Yes, Travis, the China Chinese. Yeah. Sweatshops. Kids eating dogs. The China Chinese. Good night, Travis. Good work. It never gets any easier. The hardest part is keeping them on the phone. [Karen] Well, I could quote you an hourly rate or just one price for the whole job, whatever makes you more comfortable. I am here to provide peace of mind for you now that it's time to divest yourself of these kind of things. I think you're going to be really happy with my work. Um... I just have to drop the kids off at school and then I could be over there. Thank you for calling. I really look forward to working with you. [laughs] [celebrates] Mommy's making money. What? What? Yes. [soft music] ♪ Baby, well, baby ♪ [Karen] Okay, you guys, come on let's go, please. Come on. Come on. Come on. Oh, come on. Leave that. - Gross. I'm not eating that. - You ate these yesterday. I was also forced to drink breast milk until I was two. - Tickle torture. - Stop, stop, stop. I can't hear you, I'm holding a laughter. Tickle torture. - I can't hear... - Please, stop. You're lucky I love you. That's an unborn baby. Yeah, it is. That's a good unborn baby. I can't live in this house one more minute. - Hmm. - Dad, stop. I can almost hear it crying. Hm. - I need some cash. - Oh, me too. - [Karen] You don't need cash. - Huh, funny. - Sara's mom is picking me up. - I thought I was driving you. You thought wrong. Love you, daddy. Bye. Why doesn't she talk to you that way? Said you want them girls, so... - I need some money. - That's romantic. We need to pay the credit card bills and I have to buy supplies for new client so... New client? You have a new client? - You're not the only one with a job. - That's good, helpful. - Who's the client? - No. I don't want to talk about it. I'm going to jinx it. I will tell you tonight. - Got a $20. - You've got $50 and $20. I will take them both. Thank you. If you're not nice to me, I'm going to cash in our SkyMiles and go to Hawaii. I might not take you with me. Honey, if you can find someone else, I'd say go for it. You guys. You guys. You guys. Let's go. - Come on. - [Henry] Trinity, always around the front of the car. - [Karen]What time will you be home? - [Henry] What? - [Karen] Matty, come on. - [Henry] Work. After work. - [Karen] No, leave that stick. - [Henry] Matty. Matty. [soft music] The kids don't want me to throw anything out. God forbid, I throw something important out. - Of course. - So I told them come and get it. - Mm-Hm? - Well, of course, no one showed up. - No, no. - Now I'm warning you. - We were married for 50 years. - I can't even imagine that. For the first few years it was good, it really was. And the last few years were pretty good too. It's all that shit in the middle that's a pain in the ass. Here it is. - Okay. - Are you sure? - I can work with this. - I mean, I just don't know what you need or anything to do all this. That is why I am here. We got this. - Bless you. - It's my thing. I love it. [laughs] Nice tits. [soft music] [woman moaning] Oh, my God. God. Do you do that a lot? I don't know. Sometimes. I guess I'm... I get turned on when you're not around. I got to do something. So, just sneak home from work and... I think of you... I can't sleep here. [Henry] Jackson, this is Henry Warner calling. Great. Good. Listen, the reason I'm calling, Jack, you told me if ever felt like jumping ship to give you a call so I... That was a while ago yep... Right. Borderline Capital is just getting old, you know what it is. It's just... it's getting... it's an old... it's an old company. W-A-R-N-E... R. - [dialing] - [woman] Hey, Albert, this is your mom... - [woman] You have reached the voicemail of... - [Trinity] Henry. [man] Listen, I don't think you understand. If you do not pay... - You have reached the voicemail of... - [Trinity] Henry. [woman] I'm going to tell you what I'm wearing if you make a payment today. - [man] Yes. You'll have the IRS... - You have reached the voicemail of... I am wearing a... red laced pushup bra from France. No, you take yours back. - You have reached the voicemail of... - Henry. Well, if you hear anything, you know, let me give you mine... Hello? Great. How are you? Inoperable? One W. W-A-R-N-E-R. Warner. No, I was just calling to check in. Hello. Yeah, well, if you... no if you do, you got my number. Trip, listen, let me cut right to the chase, alright. Yeah. [sings] It has been. No I remember her. I married her. [phone ringing] Henry Wa... He... Henry. God, I'd die if I smoked that many cigarettes. That's how Bill died. Massive heart attack right where you're sitting. At first we didn't even notice. Big cloud of smoke. [choking] On your right, your right. Jesus. You look tan. I'm not tan. [music in the headphones] Touch it and you die. I swear I'll kill you. - Let go! - I told you not to touch it. Okay. Come on. Cut it out. Cut it out. - I told her not to touch it. - Stop it. Quit it. I said quit it. - No, you want to kill your sister? - Yes. - Okay. You know what, here, take it. - What? - You want to kill her. It makes you happy, kill her. - No! I'm so sorry, Trinity, it's what Melissa wants, so you'll have to just hush. Take the knife. - Here. Take it. - No, Mom. No. Melissa, take the knife. You missed your chance. You're so weird. You want to kill your sister, I'm here for you. - It's a lot of water, man. - I'm a Yuride driver. Got to have water for the customers. - And you're in the back. - What? By the way, don't pick me up. I have a date with Ian after school. Wait a minute. - Love you mom. - Love you, too. Are you my Yuride? You're in the back. Yes. Can you believe that? This is my first day on the job. - Congrats. - You're my first passenger. You want me to move the seat up, I can move the seat up. - I'm fine, thank you. - Okay. So, less chatter, more driving. Here we go. - Want water? I can get you water. - I'm fine, thank you. Yeah, I used to be a marketing executive over Borderline Capital. Ten years. Yeah. Good job. But at some point you just got to move on or they move you on. You know. I should've seen the writing on the wall when they gave my promotion to this little shit from business school. That's some tough shit, man. Yeah, it's tough shit. That is some tough shit. Can you please turn the radio on? I thought the company was in a transition phase, yeah. Transition you out phase. God, I'm in this car. It's too creepy. They couldn't even operate a copy machine at the beginning now he's driving a Beemer, banging supermodels and flying to China. I'm the one without a job. Excuse me. What I meant to say was, can you shut the fuck up? Yeah. [sighs] Yeah. Shred. Yeah, shred. My daughter, she can wear anything that she wants and she can stay up as late as she wants. - Same. - It's not like I'm like those other anal retentive mothers that dress their daughters like country club Barbie dolls then they want their daughters to grow up and be a little country club bitches like they are. - What did you just... - Oh, I don't know. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Oh, God. Okay, wait, it's here. Um... I wasn't paying attention. I am so sorry. - I don't know what I was thinking. - I don't need it to tell me that I was married for 50 years, it's just a piece of paper, that's all. [slow music] - Hey. - Hey. We're going to 33 Beaumont Street. You're in the back. Okay, now I want you to work me out... Jesus Christ. Well, huh, this is interesting. - [man]You two know each other? - Yeah, this is my son-in-law. Don't feel like you have to tip him just because I know him. Mm-hmm. Drive. Hey, Mr. Yuride, why don't you go steal somebody else's job? - [man 1]Sir Robert... - [man 2] what kind of the fucked up name is Bosom? What the... get this bike out of here? For the night time, this is not a fucking bike. I'm sorry, sir, I didn't want to get it stolen again. Do I look like I give a flying fuck? You're close to closing yet? I feel like maybe if I went to their house... No, they're lining up bags of cash for the kid. - He's doing great. - Really, he's making progress. Nowhere to put the cash he's bringing in. Get on the goddamn phone. Get back to work everyone. [crying] I hate this job. [slow music] [laughs] [Karen] I cannot believe you come out with new ways to embarrass me. Henry likes it, don't you, Henry? - Love it. - Oh, yeah. I think it's sexy. I think it's inappropriate. It'll look great in the crop top. I'm sure if you're a teenager. - I think it's sexy. - Well, we're glad you feel that way. [both laughing] No. - Don't overreact. - Yeah, here we go. - How could you have done this? - [mother] Calm down. - I think it's sexy. - Just relax. - Who did what? - I think it's sexy. - Dad... - Oh. Oh, oh. Okay, that's nice. Can you take that out? It's a very big deal and you don't understand your grandmother shouldn't have done it. - Take it out. - It's not her fault. - It's her fault. - No, we had fun together. - [Karen] It's, believe me. - [Melissa] No, it's not. - I decided to do it. - This is not the time. - Take out the belly ring. - No. No. It is my body and I am choosing what I want to do with this. - Hi. - So take that belly ring out of your body. - No, Mom. - Take it out of your body. - I think I got the wrong house. - Take it out. Melissa... - Take it out. - You are crazy and you ruin everything, Mom. You ruin everything and I hate you. Melissa, come back here right now! - [Melissa] I hate you. - [shuts the door violently] What on earth makes you think you can do that? I am her mother. You are not her mother. I am so sorry for once again ruining everything. - I think it's fine. - Henry, when she decides to apologize to me, tell her to give me a call. - That's just a belly ring. - I can't believe you're siding with her. - I'm not taking sides. - When I say something, you have to stand with me. We are married. You have to stand with me. Stand together. Us, them. She's already ruined my life. I can't believe she's going to ruin my children's. You're overreacting. No one's life is getting ruined. You never agree with my mother. Now you're taking her side? You never agree with my mother. You never agree with my mom. I lost my job. Don't even joke about that. I lost my job. I totally lost my job and I told your mom. What? - You told my fucking mother. - I didn't mean to tell your mom. She got in the back and so she found out. - Why didn't you tell me? - I wasn't going to tell anybody. I didn't expect your mother to get in the back of the damn Yuride, that's all. - What were you doing in a Yuride? - I was driving the thing. I was... I had the job, I lost the job, I had a second job and I probably lost that job. She got in the back when I had that job... briefly had that job. She got in and started kissing some guy. You are driving a fucking cab? - It's a Yuride. Yuride! - Oh, my God. I didn't sign up to marry a fucking Uber driver. - Yuride actually. - What? It's Yuride. It's a different company. It's temporary until I figure some shit out. I can't believe this is happening. Great. That's good. Take another happy pill. why don't we all take a pill? One big happy fucking pill party. Just can't believe this. This is why these were invented, so, yeah! I'm going to have a big fucking party! If you weren't high all the time, I would've told you sooner. - Yeah, that's it. I'm a junkie, is that what you're saying? - No. [Melissa] And that's one way to New York, correct? And how much for first class? Sorry, can you say that again? Sorry, you keep on breaking up. One more time. - [continue fighting in the back] - Can you hold my reservation? - [phone ringing] - Okay. Thank you. Bye. You've got Melissa. Oh, Melissa. Hi. - Is Henry Warner... - Dad! - Dad, phone. - Melissa... hey, Melissa, you're still there? - They're fighting. - Just trust me I know it's such that your parents are fighting and it might not seem fair but... Fair? You're talking about fair. What's not fair is that chickens spend their whole life in cages - just waiting to be killed. - But those are chickens. You're just like everybody else. It's okay. That's why I'm leaving here and moving to New York. No personal calls at work. You take downers so technically you're laid out - half the fucking time. - Go fuck yourself. Good option, you're not fucking me, me fucking myself might be a better option. Oh, you know what? yeah, it's me, it's me, I'm the problem, right, me and my pills but you know what? Let's just get rid of them. Let's get rid of all of them. You know, oh, these, Finpecia. Oh, God, I hope you're going to get bald, baby. No. All right. Fine. We'll throw the pills out, that's great. What do you got here? Alprazolam, some kind of... Oh, look, empty already. Good for you. Okay. Deep breath. You're mad. I get it. You're mad. Do you have any idea how disgusting it is to have to find out my mother walked in on you beating off? Any idea? [soft music over headphones] [slow music] [Karen speaking indistinctly] Where are my keys? Who took my keys? Everyone take my things and they never put them back! - All right. Just... - No one respects anything of mine. Just take a breath, okay. I can't breathe. I do everything for this family, I do it all. I sit at fucking ice rinks because your daughter wanted to play hockey. No one puts anything back where it belongs. No one wants to replace the toilet paper. How hard is it to replace the toilet paper roll? Where are my keys? You don't need your keys. Come to bed, we'll talk. Why is there a sandwich in the couch? [grunts] Where are my keys? Of course they are exactly where I put them. I should've found them but I couldn't because I am losing my mind! I am done! [grunts] I can't do this. [indistinct] - [car engine starts] - Where are you going? - Get away from me. - Hey. Karen, get out of the car. Honey, get... stop the car. Damn it, can we just... can we talk? - [horn] - Get out of my way. - Get out of my way. - Okay. Oh. Oh... [tension music] [moaning] - Oh, my God. - I'm fine. - I'm fine. - Dad! You're bleeding. - No, I'm... - Oh, my God. There's so much blood. - I'm calling 911. - No. We're not calling 911. Yes, you are going to the hospital. - I can't go to the hospital. - It's everywhere. No, no. It's fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm calling 911. I'm getting you ice, okay. Why the hell is the ice in this house? Calm down. The kids will hear you. It looks and feels worse than it is. You want me to calm down when my father's dying? - I'm not dying. - Put this on your face. - Oh. - Watch it. I'm sorry. Did she do this to you? if she did, - this is attempted murder. - It's an accident. - It's an accident. - How is it an accident? - It's fine. We're fine. - Oh, my God. If I lost my job, he'll be the first person I told. I would've told him and... how can he not tell me? Stop eating that. You're not even listening to me. I am, but you can say it - without stuffing your face. - What? If you're going to be back on the market again, you got to stay in shape. You wanted this to happen. Don't be ridiculous. I stopped wishing for this years ago. Oh. [soft music] - [knocking] - [mother] Honey! Honey, open the door. It was just a joke. Are you guys getting a divorce? What? No, no. Good night, dad. [soft music continues] [Henry] Lights on. Lights off. Lights on. Lights off. Lights on. Lights off. Lights on. [soft music continues] [phone ringing] - Hello. - [Travis] Mrs. Warner, this is Travis Parker. I spoke to you once before and it's really important - that I talk to your husband. - Travis? How did you get this number? Your daughter gave it to me. Well, of course she did. [sighs] Travis, right now I'm smoking a joint and my husband isn't here so... I used to wake and bake. I can't smoke weed anymore, it makes me a little bit paranoid. Travis, I just got my period and I'm having really bad cramps. I just found out two hours ago that my husband is lying to me so... Yeah, it's a little weird. I guess I knew before you. Apparently, I'm the only one that didn't know. [moaning] [burps] You need to take us to school. - [phone ringing] - What? You need to take us to school. I know. Let's go. We didn't have breakfast. We'll stop at Dunkin Donuts. [phone continues ringing] [grunts] God. Wait till he disconnects the cellphone. [Travis grunts] Shit. [slow music] Please, please... [cries] I want you to come home... now. - I will. - I love you. I just have to help nana out for a couple more days, okay? I miss you. Please, come home. Hey, is that mommy? Here, let me talk. Karen. [slow music continues] [phone ringing] [grunts] Wow. Look at you. I know. - I'm turning 70 next month. - Congratulations. - Fuck you. - Oh. Twenty five years. Twenty five fucking years of chasing down junkies, squeezing nickels and dimes out of lying assholes and now I'm getting squeezed out of this shithole. You know what? That's fine. It's real fucking fine. And you know why? Because I'm free. And you guys... you guys are still stuck in this shit. Don't say I didn't tell you. - [door shuts] - He didn't close. [laughs] I envy you, no really I do. You probably don't have any idea how good you got it. Mr. Warner, you need to listen to me. Go anywhere you want, have sex with anyone you want. Oh, Travis... I don't even remember the last time I had sex. Mr. Warner, that doesn't matter. Unless you pay your bills, they're going to take away your house, repo all your cars. Your credit will be so fucked, you won't be able to open a cellphone account, okay? And top of that, guess what, your family's going to be living on the fucking streets, do you really want that? I lost my job, Travis. I didn't even tell my wife. I... I don't know. I guess I thought everything was going to work out somehow. I didn't want them to worry. [sighs] I didn't want them to worry because I'm supposed to be the guy who takes care of things like that. It's my job to protect them, so I didn't tell them. Dumbest thing I could have done - and I did it. - Mr. Warner, unless you want your daughters to become washed-up strippers banging dudes for food stamps... I'm back here... Matty... I suggest you get a new fucking job... I can't just start over! You haven't even fucking tried! Matty, come back here. Sorry. - [Henry] All I asked was that you watch them. - I was watching them. You weren't, if you were, this would not have happened. I can't keep track of them every second, dad. - Can you not argue with me, please? - Stop fighting. - We're not fighting. - Stop. I don't want to fight if we could just be quiet and let me think. - [Trinity] You want this? - [Henry] No. You're going to have to grow up stop making excuses and take some responsibility. Like what? Losing your job and not telling anybody? You were living on fumes and you didn't even know it. You have to have your own money. - You can never count on... - Someone else to do that for you, I know, and I have been working, so this is not helping me. Plus, you're not having sex. Why don't you just tell everyone at the bar? Oh, you can't see how fucked up your life is. The guy at the other end of the bar sent these over. Mm-hmm. Well, thanks. [laughs] If he's looking for cougars, he can bag this big old cat. Hm. [man on the TV] Known as Vlad the Impaler after his chosen means of execution and torture, Dracula had boiled, burned, and dismembered his way into the history books. Yes. Yes. Yes! [sighs] Okay. I'm sorry. - Don't worry about it. - I overreacted, sweetheart. You were right about me and I was wrong and we're frustrated... Dad, it's okay. Really. I get it. Here. Have these before they get cold. What? Is this tofu? I don't like tofu. - It's not tofu. - [Henry] Did she poison it? [Trinity] No. All right. No, I'm going to eat this. By the way, you have a job interview today. No. No, I don't. Dad. Check your email. [woman over radio] ...traffic? Not that is too bad either... [mother moans] I hope you use protection. Are you kidding? At my age you just pray you don't get cervical cancer. [moans] [woman] Is there a reason your resume says you are 25 years old? I don't appreciate people wasting my time, Mr. Warner. Fuck. I got you the interview, it's your job to do the rest. - You can't lie to people. - You lie to people. Yep, look what that got me in. You shouldn't drink coffee... You are drinking coffee right now. - It's not helpful. - I am like a free therapist... - I don't need... - [man] Henry. - Scott. Hey, man. - Hey, man. You're looking good. Did you lose some weight? Just rocking the stress diet. Is this your wife? - Father. That's my father. - Daughter. That's my daughter. [speaks in a foreign language] - What? - Hello, pretty young lady. - Right. - You probably don't know this, but your dad was a rockstar at work. Wow. Dad, you never tell me these things. Ah, well, you know, sometimes I don't tell you everything. - God, you're so humble. - That's right. Wait. I have a question. If he's so awesome, - why did you fire him? - [Scott laughs] Oh, was I supposed to ask that in Chinese? - Oh, she's a pretty smart one, isn't she? - [phone ringing] This is Scott. I told you to pick up the daughter at 4 pm at the Bloomers. Come on. - Hey. Out. - Taxi. [soft music] [plays the harmonica] - Can I have something with the crackers? - Yes. - Ice cream? - No. Do your homework. [Karen] Hi. You've reached Karen, your organizational specialist. Please, leave your name and number. [imitates the sound of a plane] [soft music continues] Let's go. We were celebrating. Frank had just published his first novel. Oh, wow! Yes, I'm sure your mother has a million pictures like these. - [both laugh] - No. Yeah. No. My mother didn't take pictures. Oh, come on. Every mother takes pictures. You have the perfect family. - Mmm. - He cheated on me more than once. - And you stayed with him? - Yeah. Well, the first time I caught him, that did hurt more than anything I've felt since. Then no you begin to negotiate with yourself. You say well he's a great father and you have a nice house. But he cheated. I wanted a family and I just didn't want to feel as though I was being punished for something I didn't do. I don't know if I can do that. [slow music] Anyone can run away, anyone but I wasn't going to. It was too important to me. I have an interview in an hour. I can't take him. Will you please tell me where she is? Hire a babysitter. You know... I don't have time. So you're going to stay with nana, okay, and... run on the treadmill and have all sorts of fun, I'll be back in an hour, okay? All right. [rings the bell] - You love him. - Hey, this is not my job, Henry. [car engine starts] Oh, come on. I don't think you understand what we do here. We pack and we ship. - Yeah, I get it. - Yeah, I don't think you do. You see we pack and we ship. You pack and ship, I got it and I love to pack, I love it. Pack cars, suitcases, boxes. I love to pack. I can do this. I can't hire you. - I can... I can do this job. - [rings the bell] Pack and ship. Hey, look at them bubbles. So what, you just leave him and take off? Yeah, just like you left your family in the middle of the night. You lied to me. So, you're going to hang out at your mom's and pretend none of this is happening. Think I want to be doing this? I don't want to do this. Then come home. You don't understand. Then make me understand. I'm right here. Talk to me. That is the problem. You should already know. I don't know, that's what I saying, so tell me. Tell me what it's because I lost my... I lost my fucking job, who cares? The thought of going home makes me feel terrible. The thought... so what? That's it? That's it? That's why you're... that's it? The thought of going home makes me feel terrible. I don't want to share a bed with you. I don't want to touch you, I don't want to be with you. Come here, buddy. [tension music] I think we could both use a happy hour. Jesus, Mom. This is my life, my children. - You should be telling me to go home. - I'm not the enemy. Why is it okay for me to hide out here like the last 16 years of my life never happened? Oh, don't make this about me. [music continues] [camera shots] [tires screeching] [panting] It's okay buddy. Just a little freak out. [Matty] Mommy. - Mommy. - All right. - Mommy. - Yeah, mommy, here we go. You keep yelling. We're going to get you home to mommy. - You just keep talking. - Mommy. You're supposed to tell me that's your job. And we both know that I wasn't very good at my job. That's why I retired. You think I knew what I was doing. - I did the best that I could. - Oh, my God. The best you could. This is the best you could? What are you doing here then? Do you not think that I wish that I had anywhere else to go? There it is. Come on, give it to me. Mommy. Mommy. - Hang on. - Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. If I was your best friend, which I know I never will be, I would tell you to do exactly the same thing. [Henry] Matty spoke. What? Matty spoke. What? Matty. Baby. Hey. Oh, Matty. - What did he say? - He said mommy. What? Baby, say it for mommy. - [Henry] Matty, say mommy. - Will you say it? Matty, say... he was... he was screaming in the car over and over again. Matty, say mommy. - Say mommy, Matty. - You can say it. - Matty, say mommy. - Oh, baby. - Say mommy. - Please tell me what you said. - Please. Make him say it. - [mother] No pressure, Matty. Matty! [sad music] Such a big boy. Henry, I love them. So for the sake of the kids what do you say you get your shit together and come on inside? - Hi, baby. - [Trinity] I missed you so much. - Daddy. - Yeah. Now that mommy is back, always make sure that you are not in front of the car. That's smart. That's good advice. That's what we call good advice. What? - What? I didn't say anything. - [Melissa] Nothing. - I don't know. - [Trinity laughs] Why did you say about listening to your mother? - I didn't say anything. - I thought you said something. - Who said it? - You said it. No. What? What? Melissa! [music continues] Honey, there's dessert. No, I don't think... I don't think that you understand, okay? because he almost has a job which means he almost has enough money to pay you back and if we had it then we would give it to you, Travis. [Travis] Listen to me. He owes a lot of money to a lot of people and if he doesn't pay it back, some really bad things are going to happen to him. I have to go. I can't talk about this anymore. - Hi. - Hey. I just told a 15-year-old girl I was going to take away her home and make her homeless. I don't feel like a human being at the moment. I feel like I threatened her. I feel dis... I'm disgusted with myself. You know, I studied economics in college. I wrote my thesis, you know, on debt. I read everything. I read every book, every paper. You know, I thought that if I could talk to people, actually talk to people that I'd understand why we do this to ourselves as a society. When did it all get so crazy? Where's the hope? I once had an eight-year-old boy slit his wrist because his dad couldn't afford to keep him in Little League anymore. [Henry] That thing was done to me in the past and I wasn't sure what to do. You can't lie to us ever again, Henry. I was just trying to protect you. I'm your wife. I know you are. This is all we have. Don't you see that if you fuck this up then we don't have anything. Come over here. - [bell rings] - [Karen] You forgot your lunch. - I got it. - Hold up. - Can I take for her as well? - No, you cannot. Go, go. You're going to be late. Bye. Bye. Thank you. I'm going to walk to school from here. - Okay. - And, you know, Karen, we did just fine without you. [plays the harmonica] [woman] You have reached your destination. I can't believe that she already blames me for ruining her life. I didn't blame my mother until I was at least 16. - Can you even believe it? - [phone rings] Your daughter would never do that, right? Never. How can she talk to me like that? I didn't raise her like that. She doesn't know how good she has it. I think you're finished here. - What? - Yeah. Spend more time with your family. - Fix things with your husband. - [phone ringing] And for crying out loud, stop resenting your children. They're just kids. They don't know any better. You haven't taught them any better. Those pills that you're taking, yeah, I saw you, believe me, they're not going to help you. - [phone continues ringing] - I'm... Answer it. Hello. Yes, this is she. She what? That was my engagement ring. I was saving our house. Where is my wedding ring? I'm holding on to it for an emergency. Oh. Okay. Travis, we want to fix this. We want to make this right. So, what are our options? [Travis] I know this has been extremely harder for your kids, especially Melissa... Our kids are fine, Travis. - Travis, give it to us straight. - It can be really hard on them. They'd have no idea what's going on and how this all works. - [both] Travis. - Sorry. As of today, you owe $83,567.25. I'm going to vomit. - Let me in. - [Melissa] No. - I have to pee. - Go away, I'm bleeding. - I got to get in there. - Melissa's bleeding. - Melissa, open this door. - Please, leave me alone. Just let me in. Oh, God. Henry. Go get daddy. Leave me alone. I don't want daddy here. Oh. That's high. You sure that's what I owe? Is the decimal point in the right place? Melissa's locked in the bathroom bleeding. Melissa's locked in the bathroom bleeding. - Wait, wait. - Who's bleeding? Melissa's bleeding. She's bleeding. Henry. Is Melissa bleeding? Is everything okay? Please, please. Don't let me... don't leave me hanging here. I need to know if everything's okay. Is everything okay? Please, let me know. Where's Melissa? Is Melissa bleeding? Who's bleeding? - Melissa. - [Karen] It's okay. - Karen? - It's okay, honey. - Trinity said Melissa was bleeding. - [Melissa] Go away. No, but if we have to go to the hospital. We don't need to go to the hospital. - All right. Okay. - Henry? Melissa, Melissa? Henry, go. I have no idea what the hell I'm doing in this fucking company! You're not helping me. She slit her fucking wrist. I can't do this job anymore. No, no, no. I can't do it. I got mine in gym class. Can we please not talk about this? Honey, it's just natural. [crying] I stole your ring. We got it back. It's okay. And I thought I was helping. - Melissa, I'm not mad. - [sobbing] I'm always sorry that I put you in that position, honey. I don't want you to worry about it. We got the ring back. It's okay. I promise. You're not mad? I am not mad. - Are you mad at me? - No. - I am so sorry... - You didn't do anything. ...for everything that's going on. - I did it. I did it and I... - I'm so sorry. No. Yeah. I thought, when you left, about... about everything that I've said and everything that I've done and the ways that I haven't helped you. You're not crazy. You're not and I didn't mean then... I know. I know. I know. Melissa. Because you weren't there and I didn't know what I was supposed to do. Honey, you weren't supposed to do anything. It's not your job, that's my job. I'm your mom and I'm so sorry I left my post. I won't do it again. I promise you with all my heart I will not leave you again ever in my whole life. Being your mom means everything to me. So then... if you love me then... then you won't get a divorce and you'll stay? Since you love me? - Oh... - You said... Melissa, no honey, no, it's not that at all. It's just... it's just so complicated, honey. - What's...? - Um... What's complicated? I love you and I love your dad but sometimes life just gets really difficult and things change and you can't stop them from changing no matter how hard you try. [slow music continues] Give me a second. I just want to enjoy watching your beg for a little bit longer. - I'm not begging. - Oh, yes you are. - I'm glad you're enjoying this. - [laughs] Do you have any idea what it was like for me to sit and watch my daughter throw her life away on some loser that got her knocked up at a Y2K party? You just can't believe that we're actually in love. It kills you just seeing your daughter married to me. And none of this had to happen if she had gotten the abortion that I told her to but no she had to get back... Forget it. It's fine. It's fine. I didn't want to come here. I came because of Karen but I'm glad. I'm glad that you're not giving us the money because now she can finally see you for the miserable bitch that you are. How are those job opportunities coming? Huh? What do you got now? [machine beeping] [soft music] [panting] Ah... Ah! Ah! - [moans] - [machine beeping] [siren wailing] Let's get dressed then go back to the hospital. [Karen] She's dying, Henry. My mom is dying. No, honey, no. Doctor said she has a good chance of coming through this. She's dying. And she hates me. And I just want her to be okay. [man] I'll give you my three junkies for your widow. - Oh, come on man... - She's that annoying. Okay. I'll take your widow if you take my cross-dressing graduate student who's gambled away his father's life-insurance policy. Ah mechanic wait 60k? Bankrupt schoolteacher and I'll consider it. I'll take your bankrupt teacher. I could always close them. The mechanic, he's selling his car when he's got 18 grand in the bank. I know I'll jump at the chance of settle. I could probably offer him 30 cents on the dollar. Fuck that, man. That's a bullshit commission for all that work, bruh. - [phone ringing] - [man] Am I fucking Santa Claus? - Forget it. I'll do it myself. - [woman] I'll do it for 28%. [man] Twenty seven point five. [woman] 27, that's my lowest offer. - Hello. - [Henry] Travis, it's Henry Warner calling. Mr. Warner, it's... thank you. Please, tell me everything's okay. Yeah, we're at St. Helens. They say she's going to pull through. It's so good to hear it. Listen, I am so sorry for every... Travis, you're just doing your job. I was not doing a good job as a human being. Travis, I'm not looking for any favors. I spent it, I owe it, I'll pay it. No, you can't think about it that way. I know what I'm going to do. - I'm going to delete your whole file. - What? [upbeat music] [alarm ringing] - [bell rings] - [man] Parker? - Well, then. - I'm not sure. You think this is your money? - They have three kids. - You think this is your money? Listen, the guy lost his job! Do you think this is your money? - They don't have it! - They never have it! Wake the fuck up! What's the matter with you? These people borrowed and spent money that didn't belong to them with a promise to pay it back. Now they want to break that promise? Someone's going to have to eat it. Sure. We'll compromise because less is better than nothing but... it's not what we wanted it to be. It never is. The system is broken. You're probably right. You're done. - I'm done? - Get your shit out of here? - That's it? - That's it. But, sir, I think I can do so much... - Sit right here. - You can ring me back. - Okay. - We'll be right back. Okay. All right. We'll be right back. - [Melissa] Bye, guys. - [Karen] Oh, God. Okay. [cardiac monitor beeping] [whispering] I can't be here right now. I'm going to go to the house and get her some clothes... - Got it. - ...and get her some makeup. Right. I'll stay here in case... Don't let it harsh your mellow. You don't belong here. [soft music] You really fucked that one up, didn't you kid? She almost died. Wow. It really got you. [monitor beeping] She's lucky to have you. I'm pretty sure she'd disagree with you. [doctor] We won't know anything until she wakes up, that's when we'll find out if there was any brain damage due to the cardiac arrest. [doctor] She's going to need your help while she recovers. It could be a long road and she definitely can't do it alone. [slow music] [alarm clock ringing] [slow music continues] [sighs] - [doctor] Your mom's a strong lady. - Mother-in-law. You know, it'll be good to talk to her, let her know you're here. I know you're in there somewhere laughing at me. That's okay because I'm going to put a webcam in here. I want to shave your head into a Mohawk, I'm going to paint your nails black and I'm going to put it up on OkCupid. Come on. Come on. What do you want me to say, I'm sorry? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay? I fucked up. I fucked up. I know I lied to Karen. She can't trust me. I fucked up, I get it. Just... [sighs] Things are not how I thought they were going to be. Everything's changing. I don't know when I'll get a job. I don't know how I'm going to support my family and like it or not... you're a part of that family. You need to be nicer to Karen. You need to love Karen more. Karen is worthy of your love. Don't give up on her. Don't give up on her yet. Don't give up on all of us. [woman] Mr. Warner. Has anyone seen Mr. Warner? Mr. Warner. - [children screaming] - [Henry] Stop! Listen, I'm sorry about that. I just... I don't want you to get divorced dad. [slow music] - [woman] Mr. Warner. - [Henry] Yeah. - Mr. Warner? You forgot this. - Yes. - Thank you. Thanks. - It's mine. [indistinct chatter] - [Melissa] Shut up, I love you. - Let's go, guys. [man] No one ever plans on losing their job. No one ever plans on having a medical emergency. No one plans on taking out a mortgage they can't afford. But we all want to believe that we're entitled to a better life and the must, must obvious truth of all, we're all living day-by-day just trying to do our best to avoid our own disasters. Our job is not to judge. Our job is to collect. Here. You got two weeks to close or I'll find someone else. - Look how high... - [Karen] Look at this. - Is that you? - How creepy is this bunny? - Crazy. It's so cute. - Right? I love it. - [Trinity] Come on. Come on. - [Karen] What? - No, I'm not. - [Trinity] Matty, come on. - It'll be fun. Come one. - Please be careful. Nobody hurt themselves. I told them not to jump on the bed. - [Trinity] Yeah. - She can jump if she wants to. You can jump too if you want to. I know you want to. - [laughing] - A little bit.
