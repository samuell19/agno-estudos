And yesterday, you are unlucky. And the whole season, you are unlucky! If your father were alive, he would say to you, "Carmello and Mario, don't be big fools!

I'm sorry, madam. He's gone. Gone? Yes. He was a little too familiar with the patrons. You mean with us, do you? Among others, yes, sir. But he happens to be a friend of ours! I'm sorry, but he... he really was very temperamental. I mean, I said one word to him, Sir Bertram, and he went. - What was the word? - Uh... Really, this is too bad. We ought to do something about it. Mario! Mario? Hello, Mario! Hello, Pierre. What are you doing here? - Can't you see? - Mm? Why did you come here? It's just as well I did.

You're so different. That's how I want it. Mario, you're sick. Sick? Yes, perhaps that's it. Why don't you leave me alone? - This is not like you. - How do you know? What do you know about me? Nothing! You don't even want to know! Why should you? But you pretend. You pretend to look after me. You came here to see if Carmello had written. He has written. - Aren't you going to open it? - Later. Mario, please. See if he's sending for me. You know he's sending for you! Anyone who says he isn't sending for you is a liar! Pepita. I'm sorry. Pepita. Better hear what, um, Car... Carmello has to say, huh? Oh, yes, Mario! We'll see. -"Dear Mario." -"Dear Mario." - Hey! Whose letter? Yours or mine? - Well, read it! All right. "I have made lots of money in this country. - It grows on trees." - Grows on trees? -"All you have to do is pick it." - He's sending my fare? Uh... - It's raining there again. - Sending my fare? Ah. "Tell Pepita I send plenty of money for her fare, clothes, everything she wants!" There. You see? "Everything she wants." Then everything's all right and we're friends again. Oh. Mario, I'm so happy! Pepita, your supper is ready! Well, what's wrong with you, huh? You had bad news, huh? Good! Mario has heard from Carmello. He has no money. He's not sending for you, huh? Mario has heard from Carmello. He's got plenty money and he is sending for me! - What is the matter with you, then? - Nothing. Sometimes that is the worst thing. When I go to England, Mario will be all alone. But of course he will! You didn't expect to take him with you, huh? Come! Have your supper! I'm not hungry. Mario! Mario? Mario! Mario! Don't worry, Mario. I used to worry myself. Worry about money, work, women. No good. Believe me. No good, Mario. Hello, Mario. No guitar? Oh, good. Then we can dance! - I don't know. - Oh, Mario.

Hello, ladies and gentlemen! As variety is the spice of life... Where did we hear that before? Yes, variety is the spice of life. And once again, good old Harry is offering to you... wrestling! So, roll up, gents! Roll up and test your strength against Carmello, the champion of Gibraltar! Here he is, friends! There he is, Carmello! The Rock of Gibraltar himself! Positively the only angry young man in captivity! If there is a man in the crowd that can stay in the ring with this boy for three minutes, we will pay a pound! If there is a man in the crowd that can last ten minutes in the same ring with this boy, he gets five pounds! - Five pounds! - Codger. Tell him what you told me about the apes. That'll take the smile off his face. Five God-honest pounds! So, come on, fellas! Roll up! Roll up! It's an honest test of strength! I've already paid out ten pounds this week. Maybe the next fiver is yours! So, come on, fellas! Roll up! Roll up! Don't wrestle with the missus. Wrestle with Carmello! And give the missus a fur coat! Why don't you go back to the Rock with the other apes? - We don't want foreigners here! - Come along! Roll up! Oh. No, no, no. No free shows. No free shows. The customers are gonna pay to see this. A wonder you fellas wouldn't have a bit of sense. Are you trying to put me out of business or what? A wonder you know about the financial economics of present-day showmanship. Let me tell you, it's a highly balanced economy! We as much as break an egg, we're out of business. And let me tell you, Codger. A 20 quid on one fistful is a capital investment. And I want him treated as such during working hours! Twenty pounds a month, eh? Well, I'll lay my wages against yours I'll get you on your back inside ten minutes! You heard what the governor say, Codger, huh? Not in working hours. All right! After working hours, then. Sí. I'll soon make your wife a widow! And now, for the grand event! The championship of Harry O'Sullivan's fair! On my right, the undefeated champion for seven years, Codger Jones! And on my left, the challenger, Carmello Gomez! And the stake is for 20 pounds a side! I'll hold the stake money for you! You'll hold it? I wouldn't trust you as far as I'd throw a grand piano! I warn you, Gibraltar. I wrestle real dirty. It's okay. So can I. Now, remember, boys. No gouging or biting, and remember, on your breath. Right! Now, move back! Move back and make a ring! Come along, lady. Move back. There's a possibility that this could be dangerous! Shake hands. Now, break! Blackett! - Drink, sir? - Thank you. Oh, Miss Anne. I had a rather surprise this afternoon. Really? Yes. You remember that young bloke when in Gibraltar who did the life-saving act? - Carmello? - Oh, is that his name? Well, as it was my day off, I... I went to the local fair. And there he was, larger than life! Blackett, are you sure? Quite sure, miss. Yes. He was doing a wrestling act. - Wrestling? - I think he got tired of swimming. Father! Blackett's found Carmello! Carmello? Who's he? Oh, you know! Gibraltar! Oh, ho! Did the fellow get lost then? Father, ever since that night at the Moulin d'Or, everyone's been trying to trace him. Where did Blackett find him? At the fair. He's a wrestler! Barbara, Michael, Jimmy, come on! Don't ask any questions! Her mother always had a penchant for gypsies. That's why she married me, I suppose. How you getting on? All right! He wins! I've had enough! And Carmello is the winner! And Codger is a good loser! Shake hands with the fellow, young lad. Well, there's your money, me boy. So much for the feuding and the fighting. How about giving us a bit of a song? That's right, governor! Make him sing for his money! Uh, do you know by any chance a little hit called "Galway Bay"? Oh, I don't know Galway Bay, but I know Catalan Bay, huh? Oh, I'm sure one bay is as good as another. Say, get your instruments, boys! Oh, well. Back in Gibraltar, I go fishing with Mario, and the sky and the sea is deep blue. And everything is wonderful, and I sing.

I like it here. Not much money, but good people. Shall we join them? What have we got to lose? How's your girlfriend, Pepita? Oh, Pepita? She's fine. And her poor mother? I'm sorry about that. But I needed the money. And you did forgive me, remember? I remember, of course. Is that for me or because you're missing Pepita? Oh, it's for you! I soon give Pepita plenty kisses when she come, huh? - You're going to marry Pepita, of course? -Sí. I hope you'll be very happy. Oh, we will, thank you. Darling, we'd better break that up. I think we had. They're half the way to Caxton Hall already. Darling, don't you think we'd better go back to your party? We left them flat, remember? Mm. I suppose we must. Come on, Jimmy. I have to go. I'm sorry. Come on. I'll take you. Goodbye, Carmello. Adios. - Well done, Gib! - Good fight! You fought like a champ! - Where's my coat, huh? - Codger. Codger. Oh. - My money, huh? Who's got my money? - What money? Codger! What's up? Where's my money? You've had your money! - Where's my money? - I said you've had your money! What's going on here? What's up? - He take my money! He pinch it, huh? - Somebody get a doctor! - And you stay where you are! - My money! Get a policeman! I'm not gonna have any trouble here! But Mama, he hasn't sent the money! Why doesn't he? He will send! I know Carmello. He always means to do something and then something always gets in the way. He will send soon! Must I wait forever? Why doesn't he send? Why? Because he has no money! He has no job! He has nothing! - He's a no-good, Carmello! - Pepita! For you. From Carmello. The money. - It is 60 pounds, Pepita. - But my fare is only 18. Eighteen there and 18 back. In case things go wrong. With 60 pounds, what can go wrong? Plenty! Why does Carmello send this to you? Why not to Pepita, huh? Where is this letter? Uh, it was, um... registered! Of course! It was registered! Oh. But before my Pepita goes across the world by herself, I want to know the arrangements! - He will be writing, Mama. - Sixty pounds! Who has seen so much money? Smart boy, Carmello, huh? Well, I must, um... I must go now. Mario! You will come and see me off? Of course. Mario! Have you... forgotten that night? Have you? Yes. So have I. I don't understand why you sell your boat. Oh, you don't? You don't understand, eh? Am I asking you to understand? I'm not complaining, am I? Selling your boat is like selling your freedom for 60 pounds. Listen, I got more than money. I sold it... I sold it for a person I happen to love. A real person. For him, my brother, you see, for him, it bought a new world, a new life. The sort of... The sort of life he always wanted. You see, I got the best brother in the world. He looked after me all his life, you see? All his life. What's a boat or even a... Well, what's a boat compared with that? - A boat is a boat! - Yeah. Only a boat. - I've got visitors for you. - Carmello! My father tells me you've refused legal aid. Sí. I have. But you need all the help you can get! I've brought my solicitor to meet you. - If you'd like to give me a full-- - No, no, no. Everyone talk too much around here. I speak for myself. I hope you realize the seriousness of your position. Sí. I understand. But I don't want anyone to speak for me, huh? Isn't there anything I can do for you? You're very kind, but thank you, no. - Carmello! - Pepita! How you come here? I went to your house. She tell me what happened. No. I mean, how you come to London? But you know how I get here! You sent for me! We get married! The fare? Where you get the money? You sent 60 pounds. Sixty pound? When I send this? Carmello, don't you remember? You sent the money to Mario. It was registered. Mario? Now I know. He sell his boat. Sell his boat? Oh, no. Court is now assembling. Please, there must be something I can do for you. Sí, you can help. If they take me to prison, Pepita, she's on her own. She has no friends. Look after her, please. And make sure she get back to Gibraltar safe, huh? Of course I will, Carmello. I'll look after her. Thank you. You go now, huh? Carmello Gomez. Since I know something of your background, would you prefer me to retire in favor of another magistrate? It's all right. I don't mind. You'll do, huh? Oh. Thank you very much. Mr. Gomez, you're charged with stealing 40 pounds from a Mr. Codger Jones, causing him bodily harm, and also obstructing the police in the course of their duty. He's a good sport, sir, and he won the money fairly. This is most irregular. You're the plaintiff! Not me, sir. I don't know anything about it! But aren't you the man the prisoner is alleged to have robbed and rendered unconscious? Unconscious? Nobody ever rendered me unconscious in me life, sir. I cracked me skull against the steps of the wagon. By the time I come to me senses, they nabbed him for it. Will someone please tell me what the charge is? Yes, sir. Stealing 40 pounds from the plaintiff, causing bodily harm, and obstructing the police in the course of their duties. That's what it says here. Yes. Get in there, you! Here he is, Codger, with the money on him! What's up now? This is the fellow that stole the money, Your Honor. What are you talking...? Who are you? If you've ever heard of Harry's Fairground, Your Honor, the brightest little entertainment outside the satellite world. If Your Honor would care to honor us sometime with his presence-- Thank you very much. I don't think we want to bother with that just at the moment. Thank you. Now, where were we? About the money, sir. Harry says he stole it. But the prisoner's charged with stealing it. Ah! But he stole his money! - Whose money? - Carmello's, Your Honor! Oh, my. [sighs, sniffs] But didn't the stolen money belong to you? It did. But he was robbed first. That makes everything perfectly clear. Now, Mr. Minister, the case is becoming rather confused. I suggest he pleads guilty, then the charge can be disposed of by a nominal sentence. Do you agree? - Yes, I do, sir. - Sí, and I agree. I know I'm not guilty, but I plead guilty, huh? Yes. Uh, you're fined 40 shillings. Here's the money, sir! It's a privilege to pay it for him. And there's an honest job waiting for him at Harry's Fair if he wants it, Your Honor. Quiet! And the clerk of the court will deal with you. Now, uh, Carmello Gomez. You seem to have made quite a few friends since you've been here. I'd like to wish you luck for the future and, uh, - you may go. - Oh. Muchas gracias, señor! I beg your pardon? Oh. It's thank you, huh? Clear the court, please, Sergeant. Come along. Clear the court, please. Get out now. Come along. Now, you're both coming home with me. No arguments! Come along. Clear the court, please. Cheer up, Pepita. It's all over now. There's nothing to worry about! It's not Carmello I'm worried about. - It's Mario. - Come inside and tell me. Pepita, come to my room. Blackett, will you look after Mr. Gomez and see that he gets some tea, please? Very good, miss. Uh, your coat, sir? Yes, it's my coat. No, uh... May I take your coat, sir? Oh. Thank you, sir. Are you wondering where we've met, sir? Yes, yes. - Gibraltar? - Oh. When you rescued that young woman? Very heroic and very profitable. - Cigarette, sir? - Oh! No, thank you. Uh, you know, the old man, he... he is good man, huh? Very good man. He forgive and forget. Yes. - I wouldn't try it again if I were you. - Who, me? Oh! Hello, hello, hello. Here we are. Have you had anything? Blackett, given him any refreshments? - Miss Anne ordered tea, sir. - Tea? Nothing stronger than that? - No, thank you, sir. - Sit yourself down. - Thank you. - You had a lucky escape, you know, my boy. Might have been 18 months inside. Yes, I know. But you see what happen when I try to go honest? - Cigarette? - No, thank you. When are you gonna marry this pretty little mermaid of yours then? Oh, how soon can... can I marry? Well, there are two ways of doing that. You've got a match? Oh, no. All right. I've got a lighter. You can get married by special license in the registry office. Registry office? Oh, no. It's no good. I want to get married proper, in church. Well, that will take you three weeks. They've got to put up the banns, you know. - Banns? - Banns, yes, yes, yes. Is nothing easy in England? Offhand, nothing I can think of, no. - Father? - My dear? Could I have a few words alone with Carmello? By all means. Let me know when tea's ready. Do you remember that tune, Carmello? We danced to it. Yes, I remember. Sí! What's it like living in Gibraltar? Oh, it's good. Very good. - I'd like to try it. - Oh, you must one day! - Carmello? - Mm-hmm. - How would you like to marry me? - Huh? And what do you wanna do? Put me in the bigamy court? I marry Pepita. You know that. - And if you didn't? - Oh, maybe I marry you, I think! - Thank you! That's very flattering. - Oh, it's nothing. - Do you love her? - Of course! I marry her! Does she love you? Of course. Hey, why you say this? How would you feel if I told you that Pepita loves Mario? Yes. She loves Mario, she loves me. But she only marry one. Mario, he find his own girl. And if Mario loves Pepita? Mario? Hey, what you say? I no understand this! You mean, Pepita wants to marry Mario? - That's exactly what I do mean. - You're crazy! Why do you think I work so hard to bring Pepita here, huh? She love me! She come with me! Carmello! Hey. It's no good. Pepita. Look. As long as Mario loves you and you love him, I am happy. You go back to the Gib and you get married, huh? No. It's all right. I find my own girl, huh? Mario! Mario! Carmello? What do you want? To talk to you. Okay. Sit down. Well, she's arrived back safely. And they're getting married in three weeks. That's good. I'm very happy. There's one thing missing, though. They want you to be at the wedding as best man. Oh, no! Mario, he's best man. I don't go back to be laughed at, huh? Oh, they won't laugh at you, Carmello. But they'll talk about you if you don't go. - What they say? - Well, they'll say, "Carmello doesn't want to go back because he doesn't want them to marry." - They say that? - Hm-mm. - Then I go. - Good. - Can I come? - Oh, no! No. You're very kind, but no. But I want to come, Carmello. Why you want to come? I want to marry you. I know why you say that. Because you sorry for me, huh? No. I say it because I love you! I have nothing for you. You... You have everything. You have money, everything. Money doesn't buy everything, Carmello. Pepita say that. Can I come? Well, Blackett. I wonder how Miss Anne's enjoying the simple life, hey? Yes, sir. [scoffs] I never stop wondering. I've been running over the list of also-rans. There was that fellow in the House of Lords, always denounced everything. Except the hereditary system, of course. And then there was that actor chap from Hollywood, all brawn and no brain. Who was he? - Tarzan, sir. Number 36. - That's it. That was a lucky escape. You know, uh, when he asked me about marrying Miss Anne, I asked him the usual questions, whether he could support her if anything happened to me. And he said, "All depends on how much you leave her." And then there was that angry young man, sir. Thank you. Oh, yes, I'd forgotten him. That was a nasty bit of work. Earned four times as much as the Prime Minister and was still angry! Yes, and she settles for a fisherman in Gibraltar. She was never very partial to fish, was she? - No. Not exactly mad about it, sir. - Hmm. See, Carmello? I'm not so helpless after all. You mean you don't mind giving up all that luxury for this, huh? This is what I call luxury! Hey. How long your friends give us? How long do you think? Um... Six weeks? That's right! We have one more week to go, huh? You know, darling, apart from Father, who I miss very much, I'm not missing a single thing. - Not even the cocktail parties? - No. Oh, isn't the world full of wonderful things?
