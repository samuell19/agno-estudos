A SUMMER TALE Hi, mum. I'm anxious over my trip. That's why my underpants are lying between Katrlneholm and Hallsberg. But even so, it'll be a good summer. Actually, this will be the best summer of my life. I found out my summer dad is playful and really likes children and that feels good. My task is not to ensure you have fun. Rather to ensure that when you leave you do so as responsible youngsters. It'll be fine. I hope for two things this summer, mum. One, that Sweden wins the World Cup. Two, that I can stay with my summer dad all year. My foster parents don't seem too interested in me. Not by football either, for that matter. Hugs and kisses, your son Marten. Are you Marten? Yes. I thought we said we'd meet in the parking area. I'm Yngve Johansson. So that's Annika, then? I don't know. We'll find out. Are you Annika? Yes. Did you also forget to meet in the parking area? Say hello to each other. Marten, bow properly. Annika, you curtsy. Right, now take each other's hand. You can get acquainted after the meal. I don't have time to be a playleader. I've got work to do. Right... Please hop in. That's very strange. I've seen Negroes several days in a row. I wonder if it's the same... the same Negro. Please hop in. Excuse me. Will you watch the semi-final tonight, Mr Johansson? What semi-final is that? Sweden - Germany in the World Cup. The match is on TV. TV? There are no TV sets here. People listen to the radio if it's important. That's fine for normal folk. Lots of normal people have TV sets in Uppsala. Watch out, here comes the bump. That was fun. Be happy now because you don't know when you will be again. We'll do it again just for your sakes because I don't find it fun at all. No, no... None of that nonsense. Don't cling to one another. I told you you didn't come here to have fun. Can you smell how good it smells? I've cooked my special just to welcome you. You know he makes money from people dying? No... He's got the coffins in the barn, I think. We'll go there when he's asleep. Have you seen someone who's dead? Yes. Me too. It's nothing special. No... We'll have something special today beans and bacon. I want you to know that when we eat I'm the only one who can talk. You don't have to be saying, "Thank you, Mr Johansson" or... "That was very good, Mr Johansson"... Please start. Go and open, Marten. Tell them in an irritated way that we're eating so that people understand they can't come and disturb us. Don't play with your bacon. Well? Has someone passed away? Is there... Did you forget to take down the flag? It's past six o'clock. Hello, children. My name is Erik Olsson and I'm from child welfare in Molkom. Did you have a good trip? Have you talked to their foster parents? Yes. Annika is apparently a little weak at school. She has difficulty being on time and helping around the house. Do you want some bacon? It's three star bacon. We will, of course, stamp that out if we follow three simple rules: Firstly, never shower longer than two minutes. Secondly, no warm showers. It's not for pleasure, but to clean yourself. Marten here, he loses himself in adventure books and such things when there is a reality that is more than suitable for us others. If I hear the least word about negligence or anything else... ...I will send them home straight away. It can't be like with... ...last year's summer children. Certainly not. It was a mistake. It certainly won't be repeated. I was far too nice. Yes... of course. Eat up your food youngsters. And try to look a little grateful as well. Hurry up. That bed is mine! Where are your real parents? My mother died of tuberculosis when I was eight. And... I've never met my father. That's nothing. My dad shot himself and my mum drank herself to death. You can read until nine o'clock. Then it's lights out and utter quiet. Marten, there'll be no adventure books here. If you must, read this... I'll wake you at six tomorrow. Six! Yes. But we're on holiday! It doesn't matter what time of year it is or whether you have holidays. Normal folk get up in time and do their bit. Right... Only peculiar people dawdle in the mornings. Good night. Welcome to Audiofon's dance course, lesson three. South American rhythms the tango. Turn to page 11 in the pamphlet and place the steps according to the guide. Don't forget the essence of the tango: Style, pride and passion. Good luck! One, two... One, two... Keep your knees supple. Focus on your partner. That's it... One, two... Hello, mum. My summer dad has turned out to be highly unpleasant. But things are better for me than you, as you're dead. My room mate, Annika, is like a discus thrower. You know, those people who stand alone in cages and throw metal disks. I'm more of a team player. Like in football. There you work together, both when it goes well and badly. You even shower together. It's not like that outside the world of team sports. There, you're on your own. Hugs and kisses, your son Marten. Marten, are you sleeping? A little. Can't we do this tomorrow instead? Are you scared? No, I'm not scared. It's just that... I don't like being disobedient. This is how it is... People who like deciding over others don't like disobedient people. You know why? I haven't thought about it. Because disobedient people are hard to decide over. Do you really want to be obedient? Do you dare? Open up, Annika! I can't do it. Open up! Come with me. Help! Mum! Sorry, I won't do it again. I promise. Don't say too much. One day you'll lie in one yourself for real. Maybe it's hard to understand at 11 when you think life's a pleasure ground. Sorry... Stop clinging to him. Can't you see he's upset? Go to bed instead. Causing mischief in the middle of the night... Go to bed! Excuse me. What is it now? I think we've overslept. That's not good. What's the time? Ten. We're really hungry. Damn... The flag should be raised at eight. I usually wake up when the grandfather clock strikes six. It's not like me. Maybe you're getting old. We can compensate for this in some way. We can get up at four tomorrow. Will that be okay? That will be okay. So you think that's okay? We'll get up at three, then. Go and make coffee. So, what will you be when you grow up? Have you thought about it? I'm going to be a whore. A whore? Yes, you get paid to hug. Who said that? My foster father. Besides, you don't need special grades, but it's grand anyway. Annika, you don't only hug in that profession. What do you do, then? Well, you... You could say that there is a certain amount of hugging in that profession. But you should think of being something else. I'm going to be a lawyer, because not anyone can do that. God, why must you both be so special? What's wrong with a normal job? When I was young you couldn't choose. You took what needed to be done. Don't have such high expectations, you'll only be disappointed. Round, soft movements... No, no, no... No nonsense here, Marten. If you don't do hip swivels properly you'll stop growing. Maybe you'll even get smaller. Look at Annika, she's doing it properly. Do you have a newspaper? No. I'd like to know about the match. If something's important, you find out. I'd like to discuss something. Yes, of course. But... not in there. No problem, Sven... Go and make some coffee. Do you want coffee? Stop flapping! There's no one else to go to when it comes to this. Firstly we have the budget class. It's not much to consider. It's a simple rectangular wooden box with no ornaments at all. It's cheap, but not dignified. This won't be a pauper's funeral. Then there is the economy class which is the most usual alternative. It's... stylish without being the least... ostentatious. Who has passed over? How much is that one? That one costs 859. But that includes... It includes a shroud and a big bouquet of lilies. If I book ahead and pay now, do I get a discount? The person hasn't passed away? That's right. When will the person in question pass over? Soon... I can't do much to the price, Sven. I can possibly go down to 850. But that's... that's only nine crowns. I must ask. Who are we talking about? I'll take that one. But who... Please, Sven... We went to the same school! Nine crowns! What are you staring at? I can't help it if his wife came here sometimes for better company. Sven can't stand things going well for others. Don't ever pore over the past, it just makes you ill. Hello, mum. Everyone in Sweden knows what happened against Germany except me. I've felt like this before. It was when we played against AIK and I got a lift to the wrong ground. It was lonely. There was only me and a triple jumper from H?rjedalen there. But, the most lonely of all must be to lie in a coffin. I know how it feels. I lay in a budget class coffin for Annika. You have to do your bit for the team. Hugs and kisses, your son Marten. Hello Anna, it's Yngve. Yngve from Molkom. Yes... I thought I'd call and tell you... ...that Sven, your husband, was here. What's it got to do with me? He ordered a coffin for himself. You shouldn't do this. You weren't going to call anymore. Yes, I know, but I... I thought that Harald probably misses his mother... I miss you too. Very much... I can't listen to this. I don't have time to talk. Goodbye. Marten, come and help me. I can help. Really? Normally this isn't a job for women, but... ...you haven't blossomed yet so we can count you as inbetween. Hold the door. Come and help, Marten. It's not dangerous, it's empty. I'm going to pick up a client. Come and help. Hurry up. You shouldn't be afraid of the dead. It's the living you should be wary of. They're unpredictable. Who has died? Listen... People don't die, they pass away or are passed on. Animals, on the other hand, they die. And plants wilt. You don't say that an apple has passed away. It rots and so on... That's the big difference between us and all other life on earth. We have to go to Miss Svanstrim, I haven't got time to answer questions. Right, jump in! No, no, no, not in front. That's where the lilies go. Watch out! Jesus! How'd it go? What's he saying? He's trying to say that he's... he's from Africa. This is interesting for you. You haven't seen a Negro before, have you? Of course we have. In the cinema. That's not the same. This Negro is for real. Take a look. What did he say? He said that he... ...regrets cycling out in front of the car and he accepts the blame. We must get going. No, wait... He said his bicycle is broken and he'd like to come with us in the car. So you can speak English? Really? You don't say? Did he say all that in such a short time? Ask him his name and what he's doing in Sweden. What did he say? He plays piano at different hotels. And his name is Jaques. I understood, but what does he do? Huh? He said he works playing the piano and I think he wants a lift to the hotel. Okay, we can do that... Ask him where he's from. He says he comes from Malm?. Malm?? Let's get out, we're late. Jump out. Are there two? I thought there was only one. Well, this is how it is. Annika is a little... ...a little weak in the head and Marten is a little delicate and timid. But he's quick, so I thought it would be good if they attended class together. So it's fair. They've each got their own chamber pot, for instance. Who was Gustav Vasa's first son? No, not you Marten. Annika... Aren't you interested in the royal house? It's so important. I know several hundred incredible stories from real life. They're also important. Of course that's true, but... You must follow if you want to pass. I'm trying, but I forget all the time. You must concentrate, Annika. My foster parents say I don't have a head for studying. But... It just takes more time. And we have lots of time. The whole summer holiday. The royal house is really important. You'll derive joy from it when you're older. I think we'll sing a little now. How is it at Yngve Johansson's? Good. He seems... capable I think. You're staying with Johansson? Yes. So you're backward? All his summer guests are. We're not! Look at you! Marten will be a lawyer. Not everyone can do that. Especially not backward people like you. You're lucky. I don't hit people without a dick. What are you doing! Harald! Let me see, Marten. Touch my children one more time, Harald, and I'll kill you! Watch out, the bump is coming. That'll be fun. I see... The bump isn't good enough anymore. You're spoiled, that's what you are. Sweden won, by the way. Really?! The final is on Sunday against Brazil. You can listen to my radio, if you want. If it's good enough. Sure! I hope you didn't tell Miss Svanstr?m about what happened with the coffin. No, of course not. That's good. I have a reputation to think of. I'm quite respected here. Well liked, that is. Miss Svanstr?m likes you a lot. Really? She says you're handsome and capable. Well, I'm not so interested in things like that. You'll have to redo this. What did you lie for? What? Miss Svanstr?m didn't say he was handsome, only that he was capable. That doesn't matter. But you lied. If you're going to get anywhere in life, you have to lie. What are you whispering about? We have no secrets in this house. Let's eat so that we can get on with the evening. Then I'll call Sven, Harald's father, and exchange a few words. My children and I deserve respect. Remember that we don't put the Swedish flag on the floor for next time. Can we build a cart? Of course not. With reference to what Miss Svanstr?m said about me being seen as capable I thought I could tell you a little about myself. You must be very curious about me. Not so? Sure. I'm seen as a somewhat central figure in town... ...as everyone passes through here, I haven't met anyone who wasn't satisfied. Yes, but... they're dead when they come here. Aren't they? Two things, Marten. What'd I say about talking at meals? And what's it called when you stop living? Lay off threatening my son! I can explain... I don't give a damn what you do with your backward slaves! But you will not threaten my son. Got it? Then Harald can't hit my summer children. Harald, did you hit these two? No, of course. I spoke to Erik Olsson at child welfare about what you're up to. And he sounded very concerned. Let's go. I told you not to fight with the other kids. But Harald hit me. You saw it. No nonsense now. Everyone has to take a little shit in life. That's how it is for normal folk. If you only knew how much I got beaten as a child. Look at me, I'm not damaged by it. But he started. No nonsense! Go up to your room. I don't want to see either of you. I think you're unfair! Life's unfair, you may as well know it. Another thing we'll get straight is that you children must know your place. You cost money and make trouble. And it's bloody unfair on me. Try to learn something about life. If you don't want to learn, you can go to hell! You'll end up there anyway, the way you go on. I wonder how much money he gets. I don't think it's only for the money. I think he loves tormenting children. Shall we run away? No, I want to call my mum. You haven't got a mother. Haven't you understood that? Yes, but still... Welcome to Audiofon's dance course lecture four - the waltz. Turn to page 12 in the pamphlet and place the steps according to the guide Don't forget the waltz' cornerstones: Elegance, finesse and dignity. When you've invited your partner, conduct her arm-in-arm to the floor. Women prefer to be led by a firm man so remember you are leading the dance. That's right... These cans can change people's lives. Shall I show you? Okay. What are you doing? Blow into the can, quickly! Now we have two love cans and a hate can. If you blow into the can in a particular mood and close the lid ...then the emotion is kept in the can. I don't believe that. If you put the can in someone's pocket, it infects them. Here you are. What will we do with the hate can? Where are you going? We thought we'd look around. It's pitch black outside. Does Johansson know about this? Yes, he told us to go out. Jump in. Get in. We'll go back to Johansson. We hate him! Don't you hate Johansson, too? Yes, he's a bloody idiot. He takes other people's things. He employed my wife to tidy up the dead. In the end he got her to leave me. Didn't your wife have a will of her own? Get lost the two of you! Get lost! Marten, I put the hate can in his pocket. He'll die a painful death now. That's good... Excuse me. Are you going to Stockholm or Uppsala after your meal? No. Why? No reason. We were just wondering. Excuse me... How did you know it was my birthday? It's my birthday today. Aren't you going to say happy birthday? Say happy birthday to me. Eleven... that was a good age. Let me tell you, I don't like vagrant kids begging at the tables. Understand? I think Miss Svanstr?m should go home. She's had enough. Miss Svanstr?m, I think that's enough now. Let's go... Now she'll be nasty to her children. How do you know? You get like that from alcohol. Maybe she doesn't have children. Maybe she has a dog. Poor thing. What'd he say? He said that's the name of his fiance. Ask him if it hurts to have a tattoo. He said it hurts a little. What did he say? He asked if the lemonade was good. Hi, mum. We aren't running away anymore as we realise what's wrong with Johansson. We have to help him. He doesn't have a wife. That's why he scolds us. We think we've found the perfect lady for him. He who lives by rules will get on very well with a school mistress. Hugs and kisses, your son Marten. Good morning. Excuse me. Were you sleeping? No, no... Didn't we say eleven o'clock? Yes, what time is it? Eleven. Otherwise I wouldn't be here. One minute, Mrs Ljungberg, I'll be right out. Wake up, we overslept. Get dressed and make coffee. I have a client. My dear Mrs Ljungberg... Forgive me, this is most embarrassing. I apologise. You should be able to sit on this. I'm sorry, but the summer children have been careless with the repair. I promise to pull their hair later. I brought some sweets with me. Thanks. For the children... Yes, of course. I want you to know that I cherished your husband when he was alive. He was always well dressed and a great example for the community. This is not my husband. No, sorry. It's the fish merchant. I'm terribly sorry. I don't really feel well today. No, neither do I. I'm very sorry about this, Mrs Ljungberg. I am a little behind. I hope we bury my husband and not someone else tomorrow. Of course, Mrs Ljungberg. Please, Mrs Ljungberg, this was very careless. I'm sorry. I promise I'll reduce the price. It won't be repeated. I hope not. My husband will hardly die several times. Doesn't she want coffee? You've lost me a client just because you didn't repair the bench properly. You think anyone will want to pass over with me in the future? Sorry. Wait, Marten... Sorry, it wasn't just your fault, it was... I've been nice and bought you some sweets. Were you in love with Harald's mother? No, no I wasn't. We were just very good friends. Which is enough. But it's got nothing to do with you. You keep private things to yourself. Have you never had a wife? This is too much! This young man here had as many women as he liked. But that's nothing one boasts about. That's me in the picture. It starts well with women, but then when they get too close to you they want to change you. Nothing is good enough, all habits have to change. If it does work with someone, there's someone else placing demands on her. So I may as well not be involved. Where is Harald's mother now? She moved to Stockholm. But it wasn't my fault, it very seldom is. Sven threatened to kill her. It doesn't matter, I'm really fine on my own. It's just poor Harald who is the big loser. You meet a few idiots like Sven in a lifetime. But it's not anything I care about now. Sooner or later they come to me and then I'm the one who decides. Go sit in the car! What are you staring at. Can't I comb my hair? Sure. Well, then... G'day... Good day. How are things? Well, thanks for asking. It's a lovely day, Miss Svanstr?m. Yes, but there'll be thunder. Bye. I see... Summer is great... Eight times eight is 64, Annika. Let's do the eight times table again. What is two times eight? You smell of alcohol. Do you have children? No. I don't. Two times eight is 16. Three times eight? No... I think we'll sing a bit. Actually, I think we'll stop for today. I have a migraine. By the way, happy birthday for the other day. Thanks. How did you know it was my birthday? Did I tell you? Johansson thinks you're really pretty and nice. We shouldn't tell you, but he's thinking of inviting you to the town hotel. But don't say we said so. Miss Svanstr?m told us a secret today. Really? Although we can't say what it is, because it's private. But I'm your guardian and it's not good to keep secrets from me. If we ignore that principle, everything will collapse in a heap. So tell me. She said she had a secret dream. And what was it? That you invite her out to dinner at the town hotel. Listen, get going now. Finish the bench and do it properly this time. Good evening, Miss Svanstr?m, this is Yngve Johansson. Good evening. I have a problem with the children and wonder if we could meet to discuss it? Yes... Good. This evening? Yes... At the town hotel? I could invite you for dinner. How nice. We have to eat anyway so we could kill two birds with one stone. You'll have to take care of yourselves tonight. There are sandwiches in the fridge. I have an important meeting... Very important... We can use this one, it's broken anyway. Well, this was unexpected. Yes... I haven't been here in years. The last time was after my mother's funeral. After the funeral there was herring and... ...beef casserole, that's good. But mostly it was sad my mother had died. I'm sorry... I was actually here yesterday. It was my birthday. There you go. Don't give Yngve a menu. He can't read anyway. I think I'll have the beef casserole again. Sounds good. Where do you see that? It's here somewhere. I didn't really look that closely. They can probably fix it anyway. I'll have that, too. If you're scared you can hug me. I'm not scared of thunder. I'm not scared of anything. No... neither am I. Loads of people die from lightning every year. Several hundred... People that have survived say it's really painful. You get kind of melted from the heat. Really painful apparently. Then some people get split in two by lightning. That's also painful. And you're not safer at all being inside, just so you know. You are scared. A little. Come, I'm not scared at all. Yes? How did they find each other? Don't ask me, I serve any old idiot as long as they pay. Yes, that's a good summary. May I? But... There isn't a dance tonight. But there will be if we start dancing. Yes? Ask him to calm down before he completely disgraces himself. We're trying to bloody eat here! Excuse me, there's no dance tonight. We heard that. But we're not disturbing anyone. Yes... the dinner guests. Sven and his party want calm when they eat. Tell Sven and his party to look in another direction. Or they can possibly go home to bed. Well? He says... that he thinks you should go home to bed. Stop playing. Immediately! Is there anyone who understands the black? We're bloody Swedish! We decide here! Go home to the jungle if it doesn't suit you. And throw out that violater of corpses, or else I'll do it myself. This is no way to behave! Take that gravedigger away now! Before we completely lose our appetites. Don't worry about it. Some people get like that when they know they will die. Is he going to die? We met. He has lung cancer. You can stop right there! You're meant to play the piano. The piano... Wait a minute. Sit at the piano... I also found one of those in my pocket. Really? We never discussed the children. No... That's why we met. Or was there something else? It was just that... I forgot to bring it up as we were having such a nice time. You don't read so well, do you? I could teach you. It'll be faster if I walk home. Goodnight, Mr Johansson. Thanks for this evening. Sorry, I was scared of the thunder. I see... I don't think you should... I have two beds here so that you sleep in separate beds. You're far too young to cling to one another. It's not good for you... It's... When you're older you can hug and things - but you should be children as long as you can. So you each have your own bed. Besides, there could be problems if... ...you get too close. You'll have to part in a few weeks so it's not good if you have strong feelings. That's that... You're on your own for a while today. I have to go to a meeting. Will... be... buried... Will be buried. Was... buried... Was buried. That's very good! Hello, mum. Imagine only meeting dead people every day. Maybe that's how Johansson wants it. Then no one can disagree with him. But there isn't anyone who cares for him, either. We didn't manage to get Johansson and Svanstr?m together. Maybe he wants to be alone. Annika doesn't want to go back to her foster parents at the end of summer. Maybe we could have our own family? But it won't work. I can't support her and go to school at the same time. Hugs and kisses, your son Marten. You want to race? Listen! My father will be in one of these soon. Shit! I'll beat you. We'll let him win. The girl's arm is sprained, but the boy is relatively okay. I bought some sweets. Thanks. No, no, no... You don't eat sweets because they're good, but when you've earned them. That hill is not to be fooled with. It's far too steep to play on. You shouldn't tempt fate unnecessarily. Or mess about with laws of nature. It's almost always punished. You're lucky. If you'd done that when I was a child you'd have had a thrashing. But you weren't lucky enough to skip class. That's why Miss Svanstr?m's here. I brought some comics in case you get bored. Thanks! Does it hurt? A little. A little here, too. They're my favourite comics. Goodbye. Goodbye. Maybe we should cancel this... the class? Yes, maybe we should. You behave now and I'll come with... Well... I'll come back tomorrow. You're in love, aren't you? Don't be rude! We're together because you cause problems and that's all. Get better. They have such an imagination. It's almost unpleasant. I think imagination is marvellous. Yes, imagination can be wonderful. Even I allow myself to get lost in my imaginings sometimes. Yesterday, for instance, I dreamt a big red ball rolled into the yard. It felt very unreal. Yes, dreams can be strange. Miss Svanstr?m, I happen to have two veal fillets at home that should be eaten before they go bad. I thought I'd ask if you'd be interested in tasting one of the fillets? Gladly. At your house? It's where the veal fillets are. So that would be the most practical. It won't be anything special. You're welcome, but it'll be improvised. Welcome, come in. Here you are. Thanks. Perhaps we can exchange bouquets. Have you cut your hair? They don't have a TV here either. I'm going to miss the final on Sunday. No one seems to care about the World Cup here. It's a pity you don't live in Uppsala. I can move there when I grow up. I'll do that. When you grow up you will have forgotten this. Why do you think that? Because no one keeps their promises. It's a pity you don't live in Stockholm. I know what we can do so we don't forget each other. We can do like Jaques. The pianist. Tattoo ourselves? It smells newly painted here. Yes, I painted it a little while ago. It seems that it will never dry. You grew up in this house, didn't you? Yes. May I ask... Why do you have summer children? It's not because there's lots of money in it as everyone wants to believe... ...I think it's nice with a little company. If one can help straighten out badly raised youngsters, it doesn't do any harm. Unfortunately, I didn't have my own. No, neither did I. Oh, I'm sorry. The coffee... Here you are. You're not from the area, Miss Svanstr?m? No, I've lived here for one year now. It's enough, I think. Really? What do you mean? You're not thinking of moving, it's so good here. No, actually, it isn't. It's dead here. I don't think so, it's... This is a classic idyll, it's no better anywhere else. It depends what you compare it to. I don't know... I've heard things on the radio about other places. Yesterday I heard there was a fire in Bor?s. That's not good. I'd rather it burns than nothing happens at all. I don't like it here. No? Although it's nice having met you. There's melody radio now. May I? Can't anyone help me? Help me! That is what is called death anxiety. You get that when you regret things and want to correct them before you die. Although he's probably over 40 and has lived quite long. My mother was only 27. Imagine living so long... ...and not even having a friend to come and visit. Shall we keep him company? No, he probably wants to be alone. My mother wanted that when she was dying. I couldn't even meet her. Come on. I'm so afraid... Hello. We thought you maybe felt a little lonely. Shall we read the paper to you? St... Stop Harald. He shouldn't see his father like this. I hope God gets cancer... ...so He can see what it feels like. I didn't achieve anything in this life... Next time... Everything is my fault. I shouldn't have put the hate can in his pocket. I didn't think it would really work. I was just making it up. I'd like to marry you, Ulla. What are you saying? I understand if it feels a little sudden. But I've thought about this a lot and... I think we'd make a very good couple. You and I. As a married couple. What do you mean? We don't know each other. I can't marry someone I don't know. But we'll get to know each other. I've got plenty of time. Have you got a lot to do? Marry someone who can have children instead. I'm too old for that. Hello, mum. I won't have time to write that often anymore. But I have something wonderful to tell you. I hereby announce... ...that your son is engaged. I hope you're proud of me and my fiance. Hugs and kisses, your loving son Marten. You know you have your own bed? We'll put you out in the corridor. No, please, we're in love. Don't worry about her. She's probably jealous because we're in love. She also wants to be. And as we stand gathered here... ...to witness a new person taken up into God's warm and protective embrace... We feel... Oh, I see... Forgive me, I thought... Are you crazy, Yngve? We said two o'clock. Two! I understand her. Why would anyone want someone like me? Can you take this away? Goodbye. You can stay here tonight and we'll take care of you. No... Go away... Go! You can go to hell. He's just as dead whatever you say. How are you? Stop asking stupid questions. I don't want to be a bloody foster child. When my mother died, I never thought I'd be happy again. But I was. I don't want new parents! I'm an adult now. You don't need new parents then. It'll be okay. No it won't. Let go! I'm going to inherit several thousand. I already got a TV in advance from dad. He was bloody successful. It's like this... I've had reports you've been neglected. Not at all. You're a bad influence on each other. So it's best you are sent home. We're not a bad influence or whatever. Yngve was at the town hotel and left you alone. Is that right? No, not at all. We were at home playing cards. Have you had proper food at Yngve's? Yes we have. Bacon... He's the best adult we've ever met. It's very good bacon. I'll inform the personnel here to send you home on the first bus tomorrow. Good luck. They can't do this! I'm sorry, but... he decides now. It's no good arguing with some authorities, because then... ...you become a criminal and criminals go to prison. I just want you to know that I... I think you're the best summer children I ever had. But don't think that makes you something. I'm going to get a spanking when I get home. Well? Paul. No... Apple... You can't just guess. There's no sense in wasting time on me. I'm starting to think that I am stupid. Well, I don't want to marry an illiterate. I know all the letters, but I don't know in what order they should go. It's hopeless. You proposed to me the day before yesterday. And I'm saying yes now. I see... Yes... Thank you! Excuse me, where are you going? We know it's not visiting hours. As the future Mrs Johansson and I are marrying we'd like to tell Marten and... They're not here. The police are looking for them. This is too bloody much! You have to help us, mum. It feels like the whole world is against us. If I can't be with Annika, I don't know if I want to live anymore. If it's possible, send someone down from heaven who can sort this out. They'll never, never, never be able to separate us. Bloody shit world... Hugs and kisses, your son Marten. There's something. No... No. It's... it's just KG walking the dog. It's quite like the children. Have a look. There's the Big Dipper. Magnificent... Yes... There was a farmer that was kidnapped by spacemen in America. Do you believe in things like that? No, no, absolutely not. I heard it on the radio. He returned a year later and said he'd been on the spacemen's planet. That's amazing. Yes... It was a very good planet. They learned to read and write by eating a pill. It doesn't have to be true because they said it on the radio. I don't believe it. Ulla, open the door. Get the handbrake! I don't have a driver's licence! Maybe we can sleep at Harald's? He lives alone now. There's Pel?. Lucky Harald with a TV... And no dad. Shall I knock? There's one of those who decides over others. Poor Harald. My arm is throbbing. Should it be doing that? It's important you drink something. Lift your head, I'll give you a pillow. Thanks. The most important thing is that you're comfortable. I'll always be okay. What do we do now, though? Sleep. Tomorrow we'll continue westwards. To Bor?s or something... Or America... Right... Bor?s sounds good. Yngve! Your summer children are on the roof of the factory. Open up, children! Open the hatch! Open it! They're on the roof and have blocked the hatch. Marten, Annika... It's me! It's us, I mean... You said you liked us. But you're just like all the others, you lie. We saw you looking for us in the car. We were worried about you. We wanted to tell you something. What? I'm going to marry Miss Svanstr?m. That's good. Come down. He's lying so we'll go down. I think he's telling the truth. He said we were the best summer children he's had. Come down so we can talk calmly. We'll find a solution that suits everyone. Why should they get married if we can't be together? I know how you feel, but we must talk. What's he going to do? He's going to break the hatch so we end this nonsense. He does that and we jump! Will we? We won't do that... I don't know. Can't we frighten them with the air raid warning? It's on the roof. What good is that? Go away, you're interfering. I'm a little scared, Annika. I'm not scared. I never have been. Yngve, you know the children. Ask them what they want. Marten, Annika... What are your demands? Marten... What are our demands? I don't know. What do you think? We can have... safe conduct to Bor?s. Isn't it better to live with Johansson? Maybe he can adopt us? We want to be adopted by you. We can't have that. Cut this out now. We'll count to ten. One... two... three... Don't be rash. We can work this out. Yngve and I want you as our children. You can't decide that! Four... The authorities decide. Go and break open the hatch. Five... No, you're not going in there! Six... Will they really jump? Yes... Seven... Eight... Nine... Wait! Can they adopt us? Yes... Follow me. She's going to Uppsala, he's going to Stockholm. In separate cars, now! Wait... What's this? What's this about? You promised them. What could I do? They don't know what's best for them. We can't yield to blackmail, Yngve. Take them. Come here. Let me go! Let go! Let me go! I love you. Marten... Marten and Annika. Don't be too sad. You'll get over each other. No, we won't. Of course you will. You shouldn't expect too much from life, you'll just get disappointed. I love you. The tattoo! Right, that's enough! Get out, Annika, come on! Get away! Come here, Annika... Let me be! Don't touch my children! Get out. Leave me and my children in peace from now on! Understood? Go to hell! Come here. I think it's best that... I never liked you, you bastard! I'll bury you alive! Go to hell!
