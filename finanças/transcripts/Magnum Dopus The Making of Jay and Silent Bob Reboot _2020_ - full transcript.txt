And later on, when this guy comes up here, she has a gun that does not fire. We're not using weapons. It doesn't have any bullets. Uh... here we go and, when I tell you, when I cue you, I want everyone to clap big, guys. Here we go. And... Hey! So, "Jay and Silent Bob Reboot" came about after years of Jason Mewes going like, "We should do another Jay and Silent Bob movie," and I was like, "You're out of your mind." Like, "I can't believe we got away with that once." You know, I had had issues with trust about Jason because he'd fallen down the drug hole so many times, so that was a reason why, whenever he'd be like, "Let's do another Jay and Silent Bob," I was like, "You know, that's cool," 'cause inside, I was like... I... It was hard to make the last one 'cause he was still kind of using and stuff like that before we started shooting the movie and, first, you had to get him off drugs and then go make the flick and constantly watch him and worry that he was... What was he getting up to when he wasn't on set? But after hanging out with him while we were making the podcast for as long as we have and traveling the world and shit like that, I got to know him in a different way and trust him implicitly, like with my life. And so we had tried to make "Clerks III" and that kind of didn't happen, and then, we tried to make "Mallrats 2," and that didn't happen. "Clerks," I don't own. We sold it many years ago to Miramax. "Mallrats," I don't own. Universal owns it. So I can't do anything with those, unless they say I can. It was very frustrating. Couldn't play with my own toys. Then, I remembered, you know, we own "Jay and Silent Bob." You don't have to ask anybody for permission to do that. If you wanna make a "Jay and Silent Bob" movie, you can go right now and you can do it. He had been clean for so long and like, you know, it just sounded fun like as I rolled it over in my head. I was like, "What if we did like 'Jay and Silent Bob Reboot'?" And we would've, but then I had a heart attack. Hey, man. It's me. And I'm fine, kinda. I had a heart attack... A massive heart attack... And very nearly died the other night, Sunday night. I was doing two shows, which we were shooting for a comedy special and, after the first show, which was great, two hours, and I was like, "Oh, shit. Like we got one more show. This is gonna be great." I started feeling nauseous. I was the first one he called when he came out of the cath lab and it was 3:00 in the morning. The phone rang and I figured, "Well, okay. Kevin would call at that hour," or my daughter. And I picked it up and I said, "Hey, Kev. What are you doing at this hour? I'm just cleaning the house." I was doing something, anyhow. He said, "Ma, I knew you'd be up. I gotta tell you something." He said, "We're twins." I said, "No. You're my son. I'm your mother." And he said, "No. We're twins. I just had an LAD opening up with a stent. He says, "I was 99% blocked, like you were." I go, "What? Wait a minute. Is this a joke at 3:00 in the morning, Kevin? I don't find this one funny." Growing up, I lost a lot of important people to me, but I was younger, but, thank goodness, knock on wood, it honestly has been many, many, many, many years since I've lost someone and had to deal with loss. I don't know. I like freaked out. I remember freaking out on the way there and then I tried to calm down and be supportive. And he goes, "Mom, I swear." He said, "I just got off the cath lab, you know, gurney and the doctor was very successful, thank God." Man, when I heard about it, it was just unbelievable. I mean, I just kept thinking like, "This just can't be true. This can't have happened." And there was that sense of like, "Holy shit. One of my friends almost died?" Like you don't really think about that. And then you're like, "Oh, yeah. That's right. We're old." And he always tells me that there was a moment where he didn't know if he was gonna make it and, in that moment, he felt very peaceful, like he had done most everything that he wanted and his life was so wonderful and beautiful, he wouldn't really want it any other way, but he's been wanting to make this film for so long that, if there was one thing that he could go back and do, it would be this film. Because, you know, when you almost die and shit, you're like, "No more like, 'We'll get to it.'" It's like, "We gotta go, now, because time is... You don't know when your time's fucking up and shit." It was clearly such a vulnerable moment in our family. He could have told me that he wanted to do a sequel to "Tusk" and I would've said yes. It kind of, in many ways, like was the impetus to live around. I'm not saying like I lived to make "Jay and Silent Bob Reboot," but, when we went back into the movie, like post-heart attack, the movie took a different shape. Once he had recovered, which, he recovered farmore quickly than I did, I guess he really wanted to take a look at his life. It kept changing. I kept rewriting. I kept adding things and leaning into the feels. A year to the day of Kevin's heart attack, February 25th, was the day that principal shooting started and, to the day, one year later, we were shooting it. Here we are, man! Day 1! Oh, my Lord! It took so long to get here, man, including a near-death experience, but we're here to shoot day 1. Today, we're gonna spend the day at the mall. We start "Jay and Silent Bob Reboot" by heading back to "Mallrats" country with Jason Lee. Brodie has now graduated. Secret Stash used to be in Red Bank. He's now moved it into the mall, which he always loved and whatnot, even though the mall is slowly dying. So there's a little bit of story there and then we set up our main story for what happens in "Jay and Silent Bob Reboot," man, so I can't wait! This is me taking all my old toys out of the attic and playing with 'em. Jason Lee, one of my favorite toys to play with. I cannot wait to see what happens. - The mall books... - Mention to the - including... - art department... Mention to Nathan. The whole history. 'Cause it's like I'll look at the movie, "That's my life, bro." I should've... Like I loved... I saw this and I was like, "Have it!" Just a quick thank you from the bottom of my heart and the top of my head and everywhere else. It's gonna be 21 days of shooting, over the course of which, hopefully, I will learn everybody's name and stuff. Never fail to come up to me if you have a question. It's some dopey shit that I sat in a room two years ago and was like, "Wouldn't that be fucking funny?" And here we are. Let's hope it is fucking funny. I love you all. Let's rehearse. I lovethe smell of commerce in the morning. - Yeah! Jason Lee hadn't acted in a red-hot minute... Four years, he said... When he came to play, but, you know, it was like riding a bike or, rather, for Jason Lee, like riding a skateboard. He got right back on and was crushing it and stuff like that. This is... It's been a while. I haven't been on a set in a while 'cause I've been on a little bit of a hiatus and so to jump right back into it with all the Kevin Smith dialogue, it felt like shooting "Mallrats" all over again because I was new at that time. I was a newcomer. So there's a little bit of sort of dialogue choreography, in a way. But it ultimately fits his world and his characters and the rhythm of it, so you go with it and, when it works... When you get it right and it works, it makes sense why it's that way. This is my only day, so fuck you guys! Hear that. Ocho for the win. Ocho for the win. - I'm number 8 on the call sheet. I demand respect. Honestly, I'm excited to be back with Kevin. It's been a long time. And I hadn't worked with Jay since before I can remember. I mean, it's been a long, long time. I'm just happy he's alive, certainly, and survived that ordeal and that he's back on a set in a mall and I was a part of it. Kind of a cool full-circle thing, 25 years later, after "Mallrats" was made. Being in the comic book store with Jason Lee again was fantastic. Listening to his inflections was pitch-perfect. It was like 1995 and 2001 and 1997 all over again. I worked with Jason Lee a lot. Can I just please give it up for the man without whose gracious patience and talent we wouldn't have gotten through this day?! Jason Lee, everybody! Hey, man. So this is day 2. Clearly, I'm in costume. I don't dress like this all the time. I used to. But, now, I only put on the coat and the fake long hair when we're on a movie set and, clearly, we're on a movie set. Look at this! Look at all the money! There's a crane, for heaven's sakes! Moviemaking is exactly like when you're a kid, and you make pretend, just with lotsmore money for toys. God bless you. And disease. Riddledwith disease as well. Nothing compares to this, man, the making pretend while growing up and whatnot. Emily, come on in. Do what you need to do. I didn't know you were on camera. Emily does my... Say hello. - Hi. - She does my hair and makeup. She... What is it, grooming? Grooming. She's the one who put this fake hair on me. This hair is attached to the hat, so you can like take it off and put it on. I don't have to deal with extensions or anything like that. So low-tech. We figured this out on "Clerks II" 'cause Jeff Anderson wanted a little ducktail. He didn't want long hair, so we just sewed the hair into the back of his hat, so every time he'd put it on, boom, he had somewhat longish hair. So I was always dreaming like, "If we ever did Silent Bob again, I would do that," and we did it. This is the show where dreams come true and my dreams are to sew hair into the back of a baseball cap. In any event, welcome to day 2. - Oh, my god. - Wait, can I go back? I missed my butt. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, please. You see it every day. I know. For some of us, it's a rare treat. So, what we got going on in this scene is Jay finds out that his kid, in the movie, who is my kid, in real life, is getting into a van with what he thinks is an unsavory character, so he goes over to the van, pulls the dude out, and beats the shit out of him. Thisis so close to the real Jason Mewes, who has his own daughter who's, what, 3 1/2, almost 4? - Yeah. - This is the preview of what's gonna happen when shestarts dating. Hopefully, she never dates, but if she does, yes, hopefully, without the physical violence because I don't wanna go to jail. But, hopefully my stare with be enough to keep 'em away. Let me see that stare. Give the camera the stare. So there's some 15-year-old punk showed up at your front door, and he's like, "Eh! What about them doughnuts?" What do you say? - The guy behind the camera, for example... - Look at 'im. - He seems like a creepy, unsavory guy. - Give 'im the look. Give 'im the look. That ain't gonna do it. That guy's going for your daughter, regardless. You gotta... You might need a gun. You here to see my daughter? So, my character, her name is Millennium Faulken and she is the daughter of Justice and Jay. She's just super tough and kind of refuses to take any shit, which I really dig. It was interesting for me because, you know, just knowing her, growing up, personally and just seeing her as an actress, that was amazing. Her playing my daughter and the relationship we had as actors and characters, it was surreal, I guess I could say is the word. Again, even though she didn't grow up around Jay, I feel like, just by virtue of genetics, like how I am somehow exactly like my dad sometimes, I think she does definitely have moments where Jay shines out of her. Whole preproduction of two years leading up to making the movie, it was like, "We have to shoot in Jersey, at least for the Quick Stop sequence." I'm not saying we gotta shoot the whole movie there, but like Quick Stop is Quick Stop. You can't duplicate that shit anywhere in the world. Like people would know, so, we gotta go back there. The locations department showed me a picture of this building that Nate, the production designer, who did such a great job, put a few Quick Stop signs on and I was like, "Well, wow. That does kinda look like Quick Stop. That's fucked up. How close can we get?" Thank you. Good morning. Isn't that amazing? This, what stands behind us, represents not only an engineering marvel, but a set decorative marvel, a production design marvel, and standing beside me is production designer Nate. Say hi, Nate. - Hey. Now, Nate, for my money, should win an Academy Award. I forgot that we work in the movie business and anythingcan be replicated, literally anything! I mean, you coulda greenscreened this motherfucker and did it in post... ...but Nate went out with Ashley, our production designer. They found a building that was soQuick Stop-like that they were able to do this, man, and, now, they skinned the fuck out of it and created the block of stores, man, and I fucking cried, Nate! When I... They got footage. I talked about... I looked out. I just got so emotional. I was like, "This is the crux of everything that I became in life." I'm gonna cry again, thinking about it. Two people in the world who you could never fool, me and the other guy whose whole life is tied into this building, Brian O'Halloran, and Brian O'Halloran pulled up and was like, "It's a fucking clone." Like, we were just going, "This is uncanny!" Like... And, again, we all work in the movie business, so there should be like some sort of like, "Yeah. I mean, you can replicate. They do it all the time," but this one, it's like somebody replicated my heart. This guy, this guy took... Here, in fucking Louisiana, he replicated the most banal real estate in New Jersey, that is the most important real estate to me. One of the interesting things about a Kevin Smith set is he is just a creative maestro and I just like to feel like the triangle in the back of the orchestra, that he points at at that crucial moment and says, "Nervous Cop." "Ting-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g!" And... action! Oh, shit! Oh! I'm not even supposed to be here today! Alright. The reason why my name is Captain Daniel Steele is one of the executive producers on the show knew me back in the day and she knew me as a guy that loved Hootie & the Blowfish and loved to read Danielle Steel novels. And it's because, deep down in my heart... I'm a very sensitive police officer that believes in love. This is the Leonardo Police Department! You're under arrest for suspicion of drug trafficking! Drop your plants, now! So, here we are in front of Quick Stop, doing a sequence that I wrote, not for "Jay and Silent Bob Reboot," but originally for "Clerks III." We were supposed to do this at the opening for "Clerks III," so that means I wrote this... Let me see. If two years ago was "Jay and Silent Bob Reboot," four or five years ago, at this point. So seeing it come to life finally is like a dream come true. It was fucking crazy, watching him run out and do the tuck. The whole movie is like a greatest hits album, so we pulled back every gag that ever fucking worked. Hello, young man. Thank you, guys. We're wrapped. I have to sit and you have to tell me. - We're wrapped. We're wrapped. - We're wrapped, everybody! Great job! Now, hold on! Hold on! While we're all here, shouldn't we take a group picture shot in front of the Quick Stop? - Yeah. - Yeah! - Group shot. - Cast and crew picture in front of the Quick Stop! This is day 4, man, and on day 4 and 5, we're going to be on a stage, a soundstage. Now, when you think, "soundstage," you're like, "Hollywood soundstage." But Louisiana, like Vancouver, where I go do "Flash" and "Supergirl" sometimes, so much production happening here, they don't have... Like all the soundstages are taken, so they just convert old warehouse spaces into soundstages, so today we're gonna be on one of those soundstages, shooting some greenscreen stuff, movie magic. Let's go check it out. Oh! Hey, there, boss. All your different styles of glasses you have. 'Cause Kevin used to wear glasses with just glass, like no prescription. No, no, no. I would not wear them. - Hey, John. How do these look? We're putting these in now. I gotta say, though... You look like you should run a studio in the '70s. I don't know. 'Cause I think I might need glasses. I was like, "Whoa, whoa." I jump back Cut! And as soon as you see the flame come out, blow it out. Blow in, blow out. Blow in, blow out. Now. Yeah, exactly. That's it. That's it. Yeah, you just don't inhale it, ever. Yeah. It's so weird. - I'll need... Ugghh! Weird day. The kid had to light a joint... A "fake joint"... Much to my chagrin, in the scene and blow smoke, but she never really smoked before, she says, and, based on what I saw, I think that's the case. So, oddly enough, Jason had to teach her to smoke. Took nearly 20 years, but, he finally taught my kid how to smoke. I don't know how to feel about that. Not proud. But it was when we turned around on Treshelle, that was when I was like, "Oh, my God. This scene is fucking magic." She is just so the light. She's so wonderful. She turned and smiled into that camera and stuff and, you know, she's kind of the girl Silent Bob in our picture, so maybe that's why I feel very affectionate toward the character and the performance and the actress giving the performance. But that warmed my heart today. I know we're making a comedy and, you know, we're supposed to be making people laugh and shit, but movie magic is movie magic and, when she turned into her, you know, close-up, looking back from the front of the car, that was truly movie magic, man. Holy shit! That's weed! That's right. - Where'd you get it? - From her. Where'd sheget it?! Sopi lives on a commune in Oregon where deaf people grow the best weed in the West. Deaf people know how to grow weed? What's it like working with Jay? I love that... I don't know if I should say the n-word... motherfucker. Or fatherfucker. We were laughing about that, so. He is so dope. He is so fun. Like he... In the morning, he comes into the makeup trailer and he's like singing songs. It's just... He's like a big brother that you're just like, "You keep being you, Jay." I think he's... I mean, he's so incredibly talented. One of the worst things an actor can do can be like, "Oh, the coverage is not me. I'm gonna go." Jay, however, is constantly always like, "Where do I need to be for you? What can I give you?" And then he's giving it 100% every time, whether or not he's on the camera, and he makes it so fun. I mean, really, there's no end to the madness. Literally every day, he's doing something so funny, I'm losing my mind. Fucking writers. - That motherfucker, man. - It's no good. If only he had spell-check. Neg! - Man. - That's what's going on? We're taking Chickity China the Chinese chicken to go see that Bluntman bullshit? Oh! What?! Oh. Uh, that's it. We have no more work left today. We've shot everything we could possibly shoot. Have a fantastic Mardi Gras weekend. Get real fucked up. Whoo! Come back to work on Monday for one day. We take Tuesday off, get fucked up again. Then come back to work for a half week of Wednesday to Friday, man. I lovemy NOLA crew. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart. Hey, hey, guys! Hey, guys! Thank you! That's a wrap! Good night! - Whoo! So, you know, Kevin, one of his favorite parts of making a movie is editing it and he literally starts as soon as he has footage, while we're shooting. And how I like to work is, when I'm making the fucking flick, I cut together as much as I can every night, so that I can show people what the movie looks like, so they can be... You know. I know what it looks like in my head, but, the job, as such, is you're always trying to explain to people, "This is what I want. This is what I look for." It's easier to just be like, "Here! Look what you did! This is what... We did it!" So, he started editing in New Orleans and would bring the footage to tape, as he does pretty much on every movie. Didn't sleep. He was too excited. It's always just such a mystery to me. He shoots for, what? 12 hours, 15 hours a day, comes home, and sits down and edits, I think, until his head hits the desk. And he'll sleep for maybe two hours and then get up and shoot again. It is inhuman. Like I don't know how he does it, but that's just the way that he operates. And that's really beneficial because people are self-correcting animals, right? So if you show someone a scene, you know, whether the actor or the fucking gaffer or the costume designer or the production designer or fucking DP, they're gonna look at that clip in a different way than you are. I'm looking at the overall, the God seat, going like, "This is the movie! This totally works." They're looking at that sequence going like, "Oh, man. I could've made that light hotter. Today, if I get another chance, I'm gonna do... Different scene, but I'm gonna fucking... I'm gonna correct that. I'm gonna make that better." That's great. You guys are doing a great job... - Aw. - ...ladies and gentlemen. I like the movie you're making very much, much better than the one I had in my head and heart when I was about to start this flick. You guys know what you're doing, thankfully. But, yeah, it's been great. It was a great weekend, but I didn't see the light of day at all. I wanna take a picture of us. Totally should. Yeah. - Oh, yeah. - You know what? We're gonna take a lotta pictures, about 24%. So, today, we're in court. They're doing the big courtroom scene with Jay and Silent Bob. Lots of cameos and whatnot, actors, actresses, coming in for the day to be in the movie and then fuck off forever and stuff like that. One of those is an actress who is also a producer. Tell 'em your name. - Jordan. I'm not an actress. - Yes, you are, today. Jordan is going to lead Jay and Silent Bob into court, but it's also meta enjoyable for me and Jay and Silent Bob because that's what Jordan does all day in real life. She's a cop who escorts Jay and Silent Bob everywhere they need to go. I try to keep them on the straight and narrow. And action. - Docket number 38, Hollywood Motion Picture Company B! Jay and Silent Bob. Because he's editing in his mind, I mean, he's editing as we're shooting, so he knows the pieces he needs, but he also encourages improvisation and keeps it very open. So it's a very fertile environment for comedy, I think, because he's very encouraging and playful and, you know, he has what my favorite directors have, which is just that like sense of play, like a kid in the sandbox, you know? It's so loose and laid-back, yet, you know, he runs a tight ship. I was a junior in high school. We were all obsessed with "Clerks." I mean, you know, Kevin said, "Come on out and let's reboot this movie and come do something." It was like I didn't even read it. It was like... I was, "Yes! Okay. Let's go." One thing, he's like the most positive like athletic coach. He like gives you pep talks before every setup. It's really positive and sweet in that way and you also know he knows exactlywhat he wants, so you're just like fully trust that, which is so nice. Hey, everybody! Happy Mardi Gras, man. Enjoy the day off! You guys earned it. Incredible... Get shit-faced! - Whoo! - Yeah! We're gonna take one picture before you go. My good man! Time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed! - Yeah! Kevin. You got that? Yeah. I'm ready. When we get inside, we're gonna say hi to everybody and take pics and stuff. Sorry we started as quickly as we did this morning, but they're doing a visual effect to make it look like we've got 1,000 people and stuff. So far, it looks fantastic. You are allso fucking beautiful, man, so creative and shit like that. Thank you for coming down. We'll be talking throughout the entire day, but it'll be easier when we're inside, so I'll see you guys there. See you guys inside in a couple minutes! Thank you! Alright, man. So this is the big exterior of Chronic-Con day. Chronic-Con takes up a good portion of our shoot. In Chronic-Con, as you can see, it's a sea of me. Like, basically, our world is based on the "Bluntman and Chronic," which means you get to have a sea of Jay and Silent Bobs, a sea of Bluntman and Chronics, anything played in that movie. Now, they're not referencing "Jay and Silent Bob" Jay and Silent Bob. They're referencing Biggs and Van Der Beek. See how meta and weird it gets? So this whole Chronic-Con, man, is like Jay came into my trailer this morning and was like, "Everyone fucking looks like us," and he was delighted by that. Thank you guys, very, very much. Can't thank you enough, ladies and gentlemen, man! Thank you for making the trip. I know I'm gonna see some of you in a few days as well. Everyone got on camera. Y'all look fucking good, man. Like it means the absolute world. If you need anything from me in the future, I owe you one and shit. Anything but money is yours. But what we can do is, if you guys are going in for lunch, I'll pop in there with Jay and we'll say goodbye to everybody, man. Thanks for being here. I'll see ya later. Please, no posting of pictures... If you wanna post a picture of me and you, that's totally fine, but nothing that you saw today - Not in costume. - Or anything. - What? - Not in costume? Yeah, I'm not even in the costume. - They're also in costume. - I mean... - Is that cool? - I think it... Honestly, I think it's okay. Like everyone knew we were doing Jay and Bob. - Okay. So, yeah, but try to like keep spoilery shit off the Internet. Alright. So you have your cellphones ready, hand them to me, I'm gonna bang it, and then you're gonna go that way. So we'll keep moving this way. I'll join you on the floor. Here we go. This is reason enough for me to go back. Alright. I'll see you out there, kids. You got a blunt? Got weed, n-word? We back at it again, n-word! Holy shit, Silent Bob! Look! It's Method and Red! How do myself and Redman play into this reboot of "Silent Jay and Bob"? You heard how I said it? I said, "Silent Jay and Bob." - "Silent Jay and Bob"? - Yeah, "Silent Bob and Jay." Well, okay. The way me and Redman play into it is something happens to Jay's character and Bob's character, where they're slipped something and they slip into this haze, so to speak, into this dreamland... Yeah, where we happen to be at the moment. You still rolling? Bitches! Don't snooch the cooch! No! No! No! I did Juilliard, dammit! No! No! We will not be doing this scene until I get my smoke. I want my smoke! So we... It was like, you know, we went in there and did what we had to do and he was... appreciated it and he loved it and we was outta there. It wasn't we had to shoot eight or nine different times. He got what he wanted. The energy was good on the set, most of all. Everyone from the... 'Cause Red and Meth, we believe in treating our kings like pawns... - Yeah. - ...pawns like kings, so when we walk on a set, we try to bring a good energy and I believe that - All the time. A good energy on the set will execute a great movie, - Infectious. - At the end of the day. Well, I have two phrases I like... "Moving on. It's a wrap." That's when you know you got it. - And "That line, again?" - Which one? No, that's another line you like. You said it real smooth, like you're used to it and shit. It was just like, when you... - Oh, "Line"? - Yeah, "Line!" - "Line!" - I gotta use that. - You gotta use that? - I gotta use that. "Line!" - See, I've been on a couple of sets and, you know... - "Line! I forgot. Line!" Yeah. That's all you do. You just scream out, "Line!" They'll feed it to you and then you reset... - Reset. - ...and go back at it. Mm-hmm. Okay. Now we go to work. Good morning, everybody. How are you, Captain? Gorgeous shots we set up for you, motherfucker. - So ready. - Are ya? - Good morning everybody. - Get that fucking thing outta my face. Welcome back to the end of week 2. So good. So, take a look. - Looking. - This just fell off the truck here, so we'll adjust. So, let's take a look. This is your big 9-wide. Ooh! That looks mean and cool. And then, this would be later. I've just gotta pan some of the lights off after we're done with this, so it doesn't look too bright towards the camera because in theory... Man, this movie's the gift that keeps on giving. Alright, big man, you distract these racist fucks while I hotbox in this fucking berserker. Oh, you did nice lean in the - Oh, cool. - Window, on the dash. That looks... - Hang in there, Jay. It'll be okay, Jay. It's gonna be okay. Thanks, baby. You know that? I hope so. I hope so. Hey, Chris. I'm gonna yell "Chris" once you start walking. Alright. Go. We all here? Who the fuck are you?! I'm going, anyway. Let's talk about something important! Today is International Women's Day. This movie doesn't exist, we don't have a fucking job, without the women who are the people that produce the movie, man. Give it up for the international women on our crew. Thank you! Then, give it up for our international women sitting right up in the truck. Give it up for the girls! The only reason we all got jobs tonight is 'cause Liz, Tracey, Jordan, they've put in their hard time and effort over the course of two fucking years to find the loot to make this happen, man, so we get to be here tonight on the strength of female empowerment, thank fucking Christ. That's the best commercial for inclusivity I could think of, man. So, I thank these ladies and all the women in our business from the bottom of my heart, man. I get to tell my goofy little stories because of you guys. I like to think of myself as a very powerful individual, but this man could not get shit done by himself. I thank you ladies for doing it for me. Let's make a movie, ladies and gentlemen. Well, that's not going anywhere, Josh. Yeah, that hat is completely inappropriate. That hat is really outta context. Alright, so, tonight was the second time I got to work with the great Chris Jericho. The first time was in Florida a couple months back, on this horror anthology I'm doing with the kids in Sarasota at the Ringling School, called "Kilroy Was Here." It reminded me of the Method and Red shoot, a shoot from last night. Going into that night on "Kilroy," you were the X-factor 'cause I was like, "Well, I've done everything else, but I've never worked with Chris. What will that be like?" And Chris like hit the ground fucking running, so we brought him back and he made the scene even better by virtue of the fact that, when we told 'im, "Hey, man, you're gonna play the Klan leader"... And what's so like ironic is like Chris is like one of the sweetest guys in the world. Number one, he's raised well. Number two, he's raised Canadian. So even though, of course, the wrestling personality, you were both sides, right, good guy, bad guy? Well, yeah, but you're playing a part. You're playing a character in that. And that's one thing I love about working with you, the two times we've done it so far, is that it's not like "Okay, Chris is gonna be the bouncer," or, "Chris is gonna be the assassin," whatever. It's like fun parts. You do stuff to show other elements of yourself as a performer, as an actor, so. It all comes from the same place. Whether you're performing in wrestling or whether you're a Shakespearean actor, whether you're doing a movie, you have to commit to it and connect. Man, you crushed it tonight. And that sweetness is Jericho. There it is. - This is important. We don't want anyone getting hurt or stressed out, whatsoever. Any other questions from anybody about what we're doing? Anyone? No question, but two statements. Can I go? Number one, man, give it up for the boys who are taking the shit for us, ladies and gentlemen. Many thanks. Number 2, Eddie had the joke of the day. Say it out loud, Eddie. Shit's about to hit the Klan. "The shit's about to hit the Klan." Well done. Alright. Hey, guys. Have a great week. Thank you very much. And that's a picture wrap on Chris Jericho! You know what's weird? Is to make a View Askewniverse movie in a post-Marvel world 'cause the last time I was making these movies, I was the only one that had a cinematic universe, you know what I'm saying? I mean, they made movies with sequels and shit like that, but like a universe where it's like this movie has a different title from this movie, but these characters know each other and these characters come into this movie and shit like that. We were able to do that across a couple different companies, like Miramax. Universal had "Mallrats." Later on, the Weinstein Company and stuff. So, you know, it's the first time I went back to play with my movie universe since Marvel defined, for most people, what a movie universe is. I built my entire life on the backs... I sounded like Matthew McConaughey... Life! I built my entire life on the backs of these fictional characters and so to be able to pull 'em out and play with them again and put them all in one movie and stuff? And at one point, somebody was like, "Oh, like it's like your 'Avengers, '" and I was like, "No, 'The Avengers' is their 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.'" We found it, kids. We're inthe Blunt Cave. This is crazy. I thought we'd be doing this pretty much just greenscreen, but Nate built a piece of the Blunt Cave to interact with, so it's literally just like "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back." We got a Blunt Cave again. So today is greenscreen day in the Blunt Cave. It's a four-person scene, but only one of the performers is here. Thankfully, that performer is the great Melissa Benoist from "Supergirl," and she's used to, on that show, I know for a fact, 'cause I've seen it, so it was awesome when I saw her this morning. They brought her in very early to like try on the costume and shit. Like I think she had a 5:00 am pickup and it's like maybe 9:30 or 10:00 now and stuff, so she's been waiting around a minute. I mean, it was adorable. She goes, "I don't have to act like Jay, do I?" I was like, "You do whatever you want in that role." So we're gonna play in the Blunt Cave today, day 1 of 2. Kevin was telling me apparently, you're very good at this, so... We have the right person for today. - Alright. - Whatever we can do to help. - Thank you. - Alright. Here we go. Here we go. This'll be the first one. First one of the day! Lend this fine actress your energy, ladies and gentlemen. - Here we go. - And... action! Bluntma-a-a-a-a-n! Oh, she just turned her body. Kevin Smith is quite possibly the best person in the industry to work with because his sets are different than any set you will everwalk on. It's... Music's playing and everyone's clapping between every take. He's so supportive and encouraging and like literally the sweetest, biggest softie you'll ever meet and he just wants everyone to have fun, so that just innately brings out the best in people. I didn't even mean to do that. Welcome back to a View Askewniverse picture, Rosario Dawson! Alright, so, this is day 5, 6... 6, 7? No, 6. No, 11. Fuck. - He can count. I know. Math? No good. English? Pretty good. Eleven... Day 11 on "Jay and Silent Bob Reboot." It took us 11 fucking days to get to this. Rosario is here. How has it been to be back in View Askewland? Incredible. I love you. I missed you. I love you. I missed you. I'm sorry I couldn't bring my daughter, so we could have playdates. I think it's so funny that we're all grown-ups now and still up to shenanigans. And... action. Action. Jussie! Hey. I'm massaging a fake person in front of me. No, I'm just enjoying. I don't know why I'm like fake... You should've brought some, then we could show! Can you? Look, man! Shannon's back. Say hi. - Hi! - See, it wasn't really a sequel. We're not quite sure what the movie is. It's called "Jay and Silent Bob Reboot," and that's more of a joke and a play on like, you know, make fun of reboots and stuff, but, technically, this movie's what they call a requel, which is a reboot and a sequel at the same time, which is kind of what "Force Awakens" was. But erase all that modern-day terminology. It did not feel like a sequel until yesterday, when Shannon came on set and suddenly it was like "Oh, shit! This is literally part 2." What does it feel like to be back? Amazing! So much fun and I'm so grateful you included me. How could I not, man? We literally couldn't move forward on the story without the mom and you're the mom and it's also like the nice idea of like, "I've watched that movie for years," and it was like, "That relationship would never fucking work," so we get to say, "Of course it didn't fucking work," but like something came from it and shit. But, Shannon's doing the Lord's work, man. Like, fucking... We had to bring her out of Africa because... Literally out of Africa because she's over there doing the noble shit. Tell 'em what you do. I'm living in South Africa right now, working on my foundation, the Shannon Elizabeth Foundation, and we're doing initiatives to help with the poaching crisis and help change laws and help buy some like land to protect the land and uplift the surrounding community and build a lodge and we're about to come out with Rhino Review, which will be one of our first big initiatives. I fucking nearly cried when you just told that story again, but fucking, doesn't that make you ashamed that you're like, "We want Justice back in the movie"? You stopping this woman from saving an elephant, you pricks, 'cause of your nostalgia, 'cause of your sentimentality. "Oh, we need Justice back." Let this poor woman go back to Africa and rescue the big fucking five, you pricks. You're doing the Lord's work. Thank you. Come on. Fucking anybody saving fucking elephants and rhinos? What have you done with your day? Jerked off. Am I right? Me too. Yay! My wife! Give it up for Rosario! She's getting out of here, man. Thank you, everybody! It was great to sweat with all of you. She's a mess. She's killed squirrels, dude. - What?! - No! She's killed three squirrels, yeah. - Well, here? - Oh. - Take it back. - Put that dog down. She licked her mouth right as you said that. Look! Look! It's you. Look! Look! She's like, "I don't care." Dano... I walked from this movie with the most important life lesson... On the best jobs, you actually grow as a person. - Yes. - Dano has a wonderful... I don't know if he intentionally did it. - Mm-hmm. - But, anytime I'd jump out of my manager bag, Dano had this wonderful way of... He goes, "Nobody's saying no." - Yeah, no. I'm not... Listen, Kevin. - "I'm not saying no." Kevin, I'm not saying no to you, but I need to explain... - Not just the sentiment, but the arm touch that made me go, "Oh, my god. I am behaving like a child, aren't I?" 'Cause only a child is like, "What do you mean, we can't?!" And he's like, "I'm not saying no." There are 9 days left to our show and we started with 21, so, obviously, we're at less than half at this point. I can do math, simple math. And simple math tells me that it's all slipping away very quickly, as it does every day in life and whatnot. "Like sands through the hourglass, these are the days of our lives." My mother used to watch that soap opera. But it's almost fucking done. And I realize there have been times, as we've been making the movie, where, through stress of production or whatever, that perhaps you've seen me jump out of my manager bag. If you ever saw me get testy with the man without whom we're not standing here, the guy without whom I don't get to make this journey, in the first place, the guy who said funny shit to me when he was 16 years old and I was like, "I could build an entire fucking career on that and shit," then, if I'm being testy to that guy, then who the fuck am I? So, it's not a big deal... It's not like people came up to me and said like, "You should fucking say shit," but, I got a conscience and as I sat there cutting footage, I see a version of myself sometimes that I'd prefer not to be, particularly when it comes to my fucking good friend Jason Mewes. So I just want to take a moment to apologize to Jason for any time that I ever got short with him and stuff like that. That's not the person he is to me and, sadly, it's... You know, you learn some shit about yourself in production and what I learned is that, under stress, I will target the people who are closest to me, thinking like they can take it. There's no reason in the world he should take it. I wouldn't be here without him. So, I'm sorry, bro. Now you make a speech! So, Brian's back and we're doing Brian in multiple roles. So he starts the movie as Dante Hicks with a Van Dyke. A lot of people are like, "Goatee!" It's not a fucking goatee. It's a Van Dyke. Then, he comes back as Grant Hicks, the TV news journalist from "Dogma," hence, all he has to do is shave this part, the Van Dyke, and turn it into a mustache. Then, he will shave it a third time and take the mustache completely off and he'll be playing Brian O'Halloran at the con. What is it like to be the new Walt Flanagan, the new Lon Chaney of the 21st century? Well, I gotta say that, when I first read the whole script and saw the roles that were out there, I'm like," This is a perfect chance to bring in every Hicks that ever lived!" - This is the movie for it, man. - Right. You know, there's so much going on in this, like me playing three roles will be a blink in the eye, compared to what else is going on in this film. And will absolutely be delightful for like true fans who are like, "There's Brian!" There's Brian! There's Brian!" Man, so it's totally worth doing it, and Brian's cool about coming back 'cause we shot Dante and the exterior Quick Stop, like week 1 or something like that. So here we are in week 3 and he's back for this and then you're back in week 4 for the con, man. He's with us three of the four weeks we're shooting. Is that too much, or is that cool? - No, you wanna see that it's blowing. - Oh, my God! You look like you fucking looked 10 years ago. It's... - Oh, you're doing slow-motion on the whole dance? - Eddie? - Oh, wow. Okay. - Yeah. What do you got? Beautiful. I'm happy. Shannon came all the way from Africa and fucking crushed it. Give it up for Shannon. And there's somebody whose performance was eerily convincing as he got railed from behind. Give it up for Jason Mewes. And give it up for the dirty little cuck who watched, Brian O'Halloran, man. So today is airport day. Look, this is the airport in New Orleans. If you were to come in for Mardi Gras or any other reason, man... There's lots of reasons to come to New Orleans, not just Mardi Gras. But like let's say you were a college kid and you're like, "Oh, I'm gonna get fucked up at Mardi Gras," you come in this airport. This ain't movie magic. This is a real airport, man. We flew in here to make the movie and, now, we get to make the movie here at the airport. So incredibly weird to be at the airport with no travel agenda whatsoever, man. We're gonna shoot some funny fucking shit. I'll get back there. Bye! Guy! Yeah? Fuck your airplane! Alright. Bye-bye. Bye, y'all. Go fuck yourself. Do it again under my breath. Let me do it one more time. Those things, I kind of made up. The great Molly Shannon! Wow. Here we are at Mooby's, an eatery that absolutely exists in the real world. It was once a beignet place. Now, it serves fake burgers, all because of this man. You crushed on movies. - Thank you, sir. - How do you feel? I feel like I did it. I'm eating it. - That's damn skippy. Now, there are three big showpieces that you had to worry about this whole movie... The Quick Stop, which you crushed. This, which you crushed. All that's left is Chronic-Con. How do you feel about that? I feel like I'm gonna lose some sleep, still. Cigarettes? We weren't smoking cigarettes, man. We were smoking that weed! You're smoking marijuana? Oh! You guys are so brave! Once again, you got busted by the cops, so. I haven't tried weed my whole life. "You guys are so brave." Kevin really hangs out. He like really is around, as opposed to just disappearing behind a screen or a tent or something. He's just there, which is great. So the vibe is fantastic. Now, what if the vibe was bad? I would go like this. I'd go, "It's, um, very interesting and... sometimes we feed off the tension." That's how I would present it. I'd spin it into a positive, but that's what I would say. Working with Jay... Because I know Kevin, I was a little starstruck because I see Jay as such a real character that, watching him, I'm always like, "Is that guy real?" 'Cause just his style, the way he talks and stuff, I'm like, "Is that accent real?" So, meeting him... I've never met him before... I was a little starstruck. It was like seeing a unicorn or something. I was like, "Wow. That's the actual guy," and his hair really is long, which is another weird thing, where I'm like, "That must be a wig," and it was not a wig. Two cameras. A-mark. B-mark. Somebody out here yell "action" for me, too, so Kevin can hear it. And then... 'Cause you're wasting him so far away. You know what I'm saying? - We got a pitch, real quick. - Got a little pitch. - Mandel's got a pitch. Eventually, take it right up to the window. Go right up to the window, so you're like, "Help me, help me." - And then, just before he's about to pound, you guys grab him after that. You could be screaming the whole time. We'll just be oblivious. - So no running... - Start there. Yeah, you could totally start there, but eventually head up there. Turn around and go this way. What the hell?! He was like, "Why don't you have him run up to the window?" I was like, "Well, because I'm stupid." And so that worked out very nicely. Thank you. Hey, before we get going, man, welcome to the family Kate Micucci, ladies and gentlemen! It's a great time. There's a lot of cheering that happens. There's a lotta like, "Here we go! Let's give it up for like so-and-so." Like, you get pumped up in a way that like, before you have every take, you're like feeling like a million bucks, and that's kind of special. Unh-unh. You did not just offer me your old-man dick! Okay, fine! Whip it out! Come on! I wanna show you a magic trick where I take one cock and make two dicks! Miss McKenzie! What the fuck is going on here? This old fool just eggplanted me! I'm 47, and I have no idea what that means. One of my favorite moments of "Reboot" was being able to give Silent Bob his first on-screen kiss, as Miss McKenzie, so, that was funny. So, tonight, we made history on the set of "Jay and Silent Bob Reboot." I've been playing this character for 25 years. Silent Bob has never had an on-screen kiss, with the exception of the... Where are you going? Get the fuck in here. -I didn't know that you were shooting. I like... - We were waiting - I didn't see the microphone. - For you. We set it up so you could dramatically enter and shit. Married to the world's worst filmmaker. - Amateur! - Total amateur, am I right? I'm just kidding. I wasn't talking about Jen. He was yelling at me to come outside. I didn't know that... - May I go back to my piece? - No. - Silent Bob never had an on-screen kiss. Once, Suzanne the orangutan kissed him, at the end of "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back." And, if you watch the face of the actor playing the character Silent Bob when that orangutan goes in for the kiss... Sheer terror. No performance. Tonight was the exact same thing because Silent Bob had his first on-screen kiss with a human being and it was sheer terror. It was almost the same expression. But the good news is the kiss was with her, so I've had tons of fucking practice, man. My wife, Jennifer. Say hello. - Hello. - So Jen comes back... Okay, well, why were you scared about the on-screen kiss with me? The beat was played with... Just shut the fuck up. Oh, my God. You're ruining everything. Stand here and just look pretty. Fuck. - You stand here and just look pretty. - Anyway. - Knock that cap off your head - Don't do it. - And see what happens. The hair comes with it. Don't do it. Tonight, we kissed. Although, now, I'm fucking starting to have regrets and second feelings... I don't wanna... So fucking... Anyway, we kissed. - I have a question. Come on in. I see there's a question from the audience. Yes, young stranger. Do you feel like it was more terrifying getting ready to do your first on-screen kiss with a lady, being your wife, or watching your wife make out with someone else? 'Cause I think it was more horrifying, the latter. Is that correct? Did I say it right, the latter? So what, because she made out with Brian O'Halloran in "Clerks"? Yeah, it upset me to see that. Even though it was acting, it was acting, but, you know, I didn't wanna see that. I don't... So wait, the root of your question is what? Would I rather watch her make out with Brian O'Halloran or make out with myself? The answer is... - No. What was more terrifying? What was more terrifying, your first kiss? You said you were terrified. - Why was I... There was no... I was terrified when I had to kiss the orangutan 'cause I thought it was gonna eat my face, but here I wasn't terrified at all. I've got 20 years' practice macking on this fine piece of woman. Oh. So, yeah, it was like it was typecasting. There was no acting, whatsoever. They said, "Action," and I wasn't acting. It was all real. He was no vegan in that situation. End of story. - No vegan? Yeah, he was kissing - Hey. - Girls. - You wanted to go someplace - Girls? - so fucking dirty - Girls? - And you forgot my wife - Girls?! - Was standing right there. - I forgot #MeMewes. Yeah. Fuck. Alright, Fred, here we go. Thank you for waiting. Alright, everybody, Fred Armisen on the roof! Chris, stand by. Ready? Here we go. Now, this upper hand is holding some scalding-hot hater! tots! It's the end of week 3, man. Three weeks into this bitch and, now, it's all fucking over. I have so much footage I could cut. We've now shot more of the movie than not and all that's left is the third act, man. All next week, and then, a few days after that, we'll be doing the Chronic-Con. So, this is it, man. I'm eating it. Playing with our continuity, you know, was... We'd play pretty strict, and then fast and loose. People would always come to me and, "What about this?" I'm like, "No, no, no. That happened to these people." Like, somebody at Chronic-Con was carrying a copy of "Mallrats" and, you know, I saw it in the frame and I was like, "No. 'Mallrats' is the story of their lives. 'Mallrats' can't happen here." You know, since Kevin Smith is a character in the movie, that complicates things even more 'cause it's like, well, we all know Kevin Smith made "Mallrats," but in the world of View Askew, in the View Askewniverse, Kevin Smith didn't. - Alright. Now... - Folks, we're about to take a look at the future, man. Give it up for the folks we're gonna spend the first part of the morning with. Diedrich Bader's here, man! Returning royalty from "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back." And then behind him, out that door, there's Keith Coogan. - What?! - Keith Coogan's here, man. And, of course, as always, Jason Mewes. Alright. So. Right? I've been on a bunch of cult movies and it's really fun to be a part of that because people that love it truly love it. It's really genuine and sweet and it's a lovely thing because here's the thing about Kevin. Everything that he does really comes from his heart. He's a genuinely nice person and so, when he talks about cons and about people that come to Comic-Con, it comes from a place of real love and respect and it's not to make fun of these people, but it's to have fun with them. Jay and Silent Bob are still so appealing because they are the everyman and every fan can crawl in and be like Jay and Silent Bob because they don't understand that they're the heroes of the piece. Still got it! I know. I know. Hilarious. This is a panel room at Blunt-Con, man. Like I've sat on many a panel over my professional career as Kevin Smith and this is what it looks like, so, in "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back," we took you into one part of my world, which was moviemaking, so we went to Miramax Studios and busted in on various movies getting made. In "Jay and Silent Bob Reboot," we enter my other world, which is con world. The first "Jay and Silent Bob," I remember we did it in L.A. I remembered it was one afternoon. One afternoon. And I must say, based on the amount of time it took to shoot that movie, the response... Versus the response. The ratio of work to response is... Yeah. It's the most outsized of any project I've ever done. I get a lotta "Jay and Silent Bob" as well. - Same. Same. - Yeah. It's pretty crazy. I mean, Kevin has the best fans in the world, right? Like the most dedicated, will go see anything he does. They love him. It's amazing. Best fans in the world, except for my fans. Love you. My fans suck because any fan of mine must be a complete moron, so... I've been literally waiting for them to do a "Jay and Silent Bob" reboot for 13 years. I was like, "They're never going to," but I've just basically been waiting for the phone to ring, for this reason. - Just kept his schedule clear. - Clear. Oh! They came allthe way from fucking New Jersey, man. Give it up for Bryan, Walt, Ming, and Mike. Why is Hollywood so infatuated with the reboot thing, the remake? I personally think it boils down to two things... One, money, just easy money... - Okay. ...and two, there are no original ideas anymore. There were never any original ideas, but... No, I think that's the answer that everybody likes to give and bash Hollywood. Everybody's always bashing Hollywood. Poor Hollywood, right? What did they ever do? I think it's genius that he's taking the reboot into his own hands and kind of mocking it. Yeah. As only Kevin Smith can... - Yeah. - ...which is kind of awesome. Mark! So, in the flick, we got to do a "Clerks" scene and bring everybody back for a "Clerks" panel at Chronic-Con and it was surreal and wonderful because, 26 years after we made that movie, here we all are, making another movie. It's kinda nuts and stuff. So it was great and it was one of the only special effects shots in the entire movie, which is ironic because the first movie was made for like 27 grand. The shot of the "Clerks" crew in this movie cost more than "Clerks" cost. Okay, so this is Chronic-Con, which is... The idea is that, in the movie, "Bluntman and Chronic" was a real movie back in 2001, built a small fan base, and resulted in this Chronic-Con. A bunch of fans put on a convention based around love of this old movie. But how we got to Chronic-Con was more... It wasn't my first idea. Originally, Jay and Silent Bob were headed to Comic-Con, in San Diego, and then I started thinking about it logically and I was like, "I can't get the licenses for 'Batman, ' 'Spiderman, ' 'Wonder Woman, '" blah blah blah, anything, you know, 'Avatar, ' anything you would like to see at a real con." If you go to San Diego Comic-Con, you see a bunch of fucking IP, intellectual property, and I couldn't pull that off, so I started thinking like, "Well, if I can't get, like, licenses for everything, how can I do a con?" I said, "You got some. You own some IP. You know, why don't you use yours?" So, suddenly, it shifted to Chronic-Con instead of Comic-Con and, suddenly, the plot of the movie shifted along with it and stuff, so necessity being the mother of invention, I didn't do all this 'cause I'm like, "I just wanna walk into a room filled with thousands of me." No. We're only doing this because this is ultimately, ironically enough, cheaper. That is fucking phenomenal. Look at that. Show that. Look at this! Fuck, I love that, man. That's amazing. All sorts of variations of Jays and Silent Bobs and whatnot, so it's kooky. - Morning. - Shit. And this is not? Yeah. - And this is also not? - This is also not. Fuck that take. Fuck it! Fudge this. Too much information. The camera loves you, Jay. This time around, you know, I think, if people had shown up and we just kind of gave them the show that we told them we were making, which was like, "They go to Hollywood to stop the movie, again," it would've been, you know, disappointing. I think people would've been like, "Oh. Oh. It is actually the same movie. I thought you were joking around." Instead, we kinda give them something... We give them the feels. I love laughing, don't get me wrong, but to feel shit? That's everything. Like not just feel happy through laughter, but just to feel something that's quasi-real, something that pulls your fucking heartstrings, the kind of shit that makes you scream out during, you know, an "Avengers" movie or something like that. That's where my head is, these days. Um, I don't know a lotta stuff, okay? But I do know this, is you're a great fucking kid and some asshole really missed out on being your dad. Thanks. Oh, my God, you guys. That's wonderful. What a great scene. To be able to pull that off with those fucking characters, that's a fucking magic trick. They'll never give me an award for that and I don't give a shit 'cause that's what fucking matters. You're very, very great at your job, Mewes. Wow. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. "Oh, that's good. That almost made me cry," and I was like, "What good writing," and I remembered I wrote it. - Wow. - Yeah, right? Yeah? - Welcome to my life. - I need to step away from that. Not all of us are in the new Quentin Tarantino movie. Some of us have to seek for our glory where we can find it. Hey, sir. You get plenty of compliments. Let's settle down, now. I don't think Tarantino shot a scene with two other Tarantinos walking around in costume. Well, this is only his ninth film. Give him to the tenth. - Marker! Alright, guys. Let's get going, please. Pictures next. As sort of an inside joke to those who know, I play a character called Ted Underhill and the boys steal my credit card number to use throughout the remainder of the film, so, you'll only see me for a short time, but I live on throughout the film. My first pet was Bingo! I don't know. 7 inches! Alright. Yeah, I'll hold. Cut. After Kevin's heart attack, I think everyone is just so happy to be working with him again and to be around him again and it's such a joyous experience and, such a great victory lap for two great characters from Kevin's films to come back in this way, so, just that he asked me to be part of it is huge. That is a picture wrap on Ralph Garman... - Yay! - ...ladies and gentlemen! Let's slide that speed over about like 3 feet? - What time is it? - 2:35. 2:35?! What a horrible thing to do to an actor, but if there is anyactor who can handle it, it's Dan Fogler. Give it up for him, ladies and gentlemen. Bee! Bee bee! Ooh! Security! And cut. Give it up for Dan. Arm is... Like when I was growing up, I couldn't... I couldn't wear my hat backwards and a long trench coat without people saying, "Hey, Silent Bob!" You know? And I was like, "Hey, no! I'm me!" You know? But he was such a huge influence on my childhood, so it's so cool to just be here working with him. Ladies and gentlemen, that's a picture wrap on Dan Fogler! Give it up for 'im! I'm proud of you. Ooh! Chronic-Con finished, done. We shot here at the Hilton for 3 days. It looked amazing, looked real. Everyone's cosplay was fucking astounding, creative, wonderful and stuff. It's just good times, man. Like, this is a big sequence in the movie that leads into our final sequence, which we start tomorrow, but glorious, man. Life has a lot of pros and cons, but Chronic-Con, pun intended, is very pro. A-buh-buh-buh-buh, buh-buh. Right now, we're about to shoot with Tommy Chong, which is a real honor for those of us who grew up watching those movies, but Tommy is 80, so we may be moving at a different pace. Let's all look out for him and stuff. We've got to make sure we hand the world back an icon unscathed and stuff. Give it up for Tommy Chong! He's right. You can't take chances with an old guy. Who's old? It's kind of good you're not using the real shit. Or else it would be... It would be one take. One and done. Here we go. And action. Smells like this reboot... went up in smoke. We just finished with Tommy Chong. I might just be finished myself. We paid "oh-mage," homage, if you will, to the man who laid the track upon which our stoner-movie engine travels. That guy did it first. Oh, you made him mad. He's mad now! Unh! Welcome to the show! Returning royalty from "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back." Joe Reitman's here, man! Okay. "Reboot" stepping up. Two cameras, A mark. Dress, then wig, Alice, and then whip the hair back and forth, as one of Will Smith's kids told us. Action! I am secret agent from Russia! It is like 5:00 in the morning, and Alice is being tasked to act. It's been ridiculous. Give it up for Alice. Take us there, Alice. I'm saying I'm your father. Did you know this shit? Nyet. That was good. Okay. so we're at Chronic-Con, and Chronic-Con is a pop-culture convention, and so if you're talking pop culture, you need to talk to somebody who knows about pop culture. I've turned to the co-host of celebrated podcast "Fatman Beyond," Marc Bernardin. Hey. What's up? Coming out to act like... Tell them who you're playing in the movie. I'm playing a sleeping person. Named? Marc Bernardin. Marc came this far to play himself. Isn't that amazing, man? He's literally in the audience as Marc Bernardin. And so we actu... We get to advertise our podcast because we know a guy. We got this on camera. Pretty sweet. Don't have to get any clearances. None whatsoever. Excellent. Free ad, man. Juice us up a little bit. What does it feel like to come out and fuck around in a movie? It feels kind of surreal but super cool. I'm gonna stretch my acting chops. I haven't done much since my years studying under Stella Adler, but I figured, like... I'll bring it for you, the high heat. It's all about sense memory, man. Or is it muscle memory? I think the Stella Adler method is all about muscle memory. It's like... ch-ch! Type fuckin' pull guns. Holy shit! The guy that's not Kevin Smith just got fisted! And he didn't even use lubricant! And cut! Give it up for the boy! That's it. So it's basically three moves, four moves. Back fist, get the stick, hit a guy, look over here, hit a guy, turn around back-to-back, and then a slapshot... tch! You're gonna back-fist this guy. Boom! Okay? He's gonna fly out of frame there. Here comes Mr. Guy here. You're gonna go... wham! Okay? Right when you do that, you see Jay, and you guys are gonna go back-to-back... aha! And action! Unh! Three, two, one, boom! Here we go. Ready, and action! That joint you gave me really came in handy. Whatever you do, don't tell your mom I gave you weed! Oh, yes. Oh, that's so awesome. This is why we did the movie. Look at this shit, ladies and gentlemen. Give it up for Team Kurtzman. And background action. Ready! And action! Post or something, but they were like, "We can't give any of that..." No, this is totally awesome...."stuff just right now. It's secret until the movie comes out." Right, no. That's totally awesome. Thank you so much, man. Of course, brother. Happy birthday, brother. Thank you. Can you hold it up for the camera? Yeah, yeah.Yes. See what it says? "Thanks for keeping us all awake, my man." Bleep. I missed picture wrap again? Dude, I had Josh outside, asking him something, and I missed it all. You didn't see the picture wrap? No, it's my fault, dude. I had him outside. Beautiful speech I gave. "That's a picture wrap on the girls, girls, girls." You hear screaming and all this stuff. Big speech from daddy and the director, but I missed it all. Not only did I miss it, I made the guy behind the camera miss it, filming it, having it. I'm sorry. And, by the way, "Daddy"? That's... That's... That's him. I don't go around telling people to call me Daddy on set. But, yes, because of this Lloyd, he took that Lloyd, and we missed the beautiful picture wrap. That was perhaps the most poetic I've ever been in my life. No, I'm actually glad. I referred to the kid as Batman Junior, and my wife was like, "That's what you went with?" And now I just double hit it. Fuck. What an idiot. Anyway, let's back on him. He pulled the camera away, and we missed the girls' wrap. So the girls' wrap, this is the last night of the girl gang, and as you can see, this fucking kid's a mess. Apparently, we just raised her in a room full of pillows and clouds because look at that. Shut up! Look at that. You know me. Like, I cry at Marvel stuff and whatnot, but... You cry... you just cried like 5 minutes ago. Aww! "Best Dad in the Galaxy." What's, uh... How do we... How do we... How do we do this? Door's locked. He runs in, tries to shake it, can't get out, two... Go in the driveway and drag him away. Everyone's going. Hopefully, we've all gotten, like, the emotional stuff out of the way, the real emotional stuff, so we can shoot the fake emotional stuff, as we head into the scene. But a lot of people here who I deeply love today added to the cast, man. Of course, we're gonna be carried, as always, by Christ himself. Give it up for Jason Mewes. This person is the only reason that I know that I could be a writer when I was a kid. I found some writing she had done and said, "What's this?" And she said, "I'm writing a book." And I said, "What do you mean?" And she's like, "I'm writing a story about me and my friends. We go on an adventure." And I'd never heard that before. I was like, "You can't just write a book. You've got to ask the fucking government or some shit." And she was like, "No, anybody can write anything. You know, if you want to write one day, you can." And it took me a little while, and one day I started writing and stuff. So I don't get here without her, and she was in "Chasing Amy" and allows me to kind of continue the story that we told at the end of the movie. This scene is basically a sequel to "Chasing Amy," as close as we'll ever get, man, and it happens, ironically, in the middle of a fucking "Jay and Silent Bob" picture. But my sister came back. Give it up for Virginia. We don't get to tell this story in this scene at all whatsoever if I don't meet this other person, man, and I told her this morning. I was like, all these trucks came to this parking lot in New Orleans, and a lot of people jumped on planes, and a lot of people rearranged their lives because her and I met years ago. That's what a powerful, impactful person she was. I did some of the greatest fucking things I'll ever do in my career, some of the greatest art I ever made with these cats, and "Chasing Amy" begins and ends, really, with Joey Adams. Joey. And this, I fucking... I just lost it this morning and wept in a man's arms, and it felt so fucking good, and I asked him questions about where I am in life and stuff like that. Sometimes it's important to give yourself over to something far more powerful than you, and I did that when I got to hug somebody I hadn't hugged in a long time, and I was just so fucking relieved, so glad, every tear spent was about, "I missed you. I just wanted to come fucking play," and we're getting to do that today. And not only did he fucking come out, which until I walked in the trailer, I was like, "We're being punked." Not only that, but, like, he came to play. In rehearsal, he just spit out eight pages of the fucking biggest tongue-twisting dialogue on the planet, almost like it was a test of our friendship, but he was like, "I fucking passed." Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Ben Affleck. Alright. We ain't done this in 23 years. Let's try it again. "Chasing Amy" was the movie that kind of saved my career, and also I made it with those kids, with Joey, Jason, and Ben, kids that I met on "Mallrats" and stuff, and this was like us doing it down in the dirt, 250,000 grand. I believed in them. Like, the studio wanted other people, but I was like, "We'll take less money to do it like this. This is an important part of who I am, of my mythos." You know, Kevin was the first person to offer me, like, a lead role, you know, to sort of like believe in me for a movie that was actually gonna be distributed and that someone was gonna do and really leveraged a lot of his personal credibility believing in me just because he had met me on "Mallrats," and we had kind of made friends. And he wrote this beautiful script, and he just called me and offered it to me. It was the first time I didn't have to audition for a movie. It was the first time I really felt like a director, you know, really believed in me and took a chance on me, and I've always been grateful to him for that. I mean, I feel like Kevin's film is different than a lot of... I think a lot of remakes are sometimes just because "The film was successful, and let's make another." But with Kevin's film, it feels, not to sound too, like, literary, but, like, very Faulkner-esque in the sense that he's created this world and this... I kind of think of it as a county, but it's like New Jersey and these people from there, and, you know, they've gone in and out of all his works. So for him to want to do this reboot is more than just like, "Let's make another 'Jay and Silent Bob.'" It's like, "Let's bring my entire body of work, you know, into one film." To play with those characters again and be like, "What are they doing now?" oh, my god, I was in heaven. You know, Kevin has always written like... Even though some of these "Jay and Bob" movies can be just, like, sort of broad or funnier or slapstickier, or like, as he said, dick and fart jokes, you know, he has a deceptive kind of... All that belies a sort of deep feeling that comes out in his writing, so I think it was natural that he would write about having children, since obviously he's done such a great job raising his own. And action. She wants to know who daddy's talking to. Hi, little pink sugar heart. Say hello to daddy's friends, the kind of men you're going to have to learn to stay away from when you get older. That's Jay, and that's Silent Bob. Yeah. Well, what did you say? I said these are the kind of guys you're gonna have to learn to stay away from when you get older. This is daddy's friend Jay and daddy's friend Silent... I have to stay them away when I get older? Why? Well, I'll explain that to you when, you know, when the appropriate time comes, but for now, boys, this is our daughter Amy. Say hello to Jay and Silent Bob. Hi, Jay and Silent Bob. Hi, pretty. I saw you in the movie, and you were so awesome. I want to see... You want me to do it, too? Is that good? And then we come over here. Thank you so much. Alright, guys, I'm turning into a pumpkin. I just want to say thank you very much. Thank you very much. This is the man who gave me my start, my whole career, my whole new world. "Good Will Hunting," "Chasing Amy," I wouldn't have them without him. Thank you, Kevin. I appreciate it. Thank you, all. It was a pleasure. Give it up for Ben! That's a picture wrap on Ben Affleck! That's a picture wrap on Virginia... Oh, fuck. I was gonna call you Smith... Virginia Sheridan! Well done, everybody. Thank you. Oh! Mwah! And that is a picture wrap on Joey Lauren Adams, ladies and gentlemen. Whoo! Whoo! Before we go, thank you, everybody, from the bottom of my heart. This movie is fucking phenomenal. I can't believe we made it in 21 days, but we did, and I got the footage to prove it. Looks fucking phenomenal. Everyone did a fantastic job. I fought coming down to Louisiana because I was like, "It can't possibly look like everything we need it to look." Not only did it look like everything we needed to look, but this crew was fucking phenomenal. You're all welcome on any show I do in the future, man. Y'all brought talent, proficiency, heart to the project, man. You've put your all into it and stuff, so I thank you, man. It's been an overwhelming 21 days. It's been a very emotionally overwhelming day, but I'm relatively sure that we got everything we needed, man. That was weird. I had to work 25 years to get a day like that, man. That's a real legacy day, and you were all here for it, one of the greatest days I ever had on a movie set in my life, working with my kids again, man. I was so fucking proud. I can't even relate what it was. One thing for them to be good in the movie, that's fine, but they came so fucking prepared. We're done. Like, we could have been sitting there for another 3 fucking hours, but everyone was on point. The cast knew all their lines. Fuckin' crew was ready to shoot the shit out of it, and we did it, man. I am just the guy that's like, "I want to do a bunch of shit. This would be fun. This would be fun." It takes very capable, smart people to make that happen, man, and in my case, I was backed by the smartest and the most capable. Give it up for Tracy, Liz, and Jordan. It's weird, the things that you care about the older you get, man, in a straight collar, and fucking hair was, like, hid on the movie. I never had to worry about the performances. I never had to worry about how the movie played out or how it looked and stuff like that because when you get to this part in life, like, we're all in the game. We've been here for a while, man. If you can run on a show, you're already a Jedi. You're already super fucking talented, more so than most in the fucking world and stuff like that, so to collect this many Jedis in one place and whatnot, trying to make a show is thrilling. I didn't have to worry about baseline things because everyone took care of their own jobs and, like, over-fucking-delivered. Like, it's weird to be a dude in a room sitting there smoking weed and being like, "This would be cool," and you go from this thing where you start by yourself, and then slowly, it becomes this group of people that believe, a congregation, and you put up a fucking cathedral, and then you're done, and you walk away, and it lives there for the rest of your lives, and people walk by it and talk about it, and you go, "Hey, remember when you built that?" And you're like, "Yeah, I'll never forget building this fucking cathedral. It's beautiful. It's the best one I ever built." That has everything to do with everybody here, so thank you. Let's finish this. So, after 21 very long, packed days of trying to make it, trying to get everything done in the 12, 13, once 15 hours... there's nothing left to shoot. We're done. It's a wrap on Louisiana. It went too fucking fast. And... I... It was a different experience than I thought I would have. I thought it would be fun and easy. And... Mm. It was fun, and, all things considered, it was easy. But I... I love this movie because this is where I found out how much I still care about the job, and... that was nice to know. Yeah, man, I learned a lot, and it's weird to say, 25 years into the job. I learned Mewes is a better actor than I thought, and I thought he was pretty good. I learned that, like, people can still surprise you. I learned sometimes it's as simple as fucking reaching out. I learned that I like working with my kid, but I knew that. I learned that I like playing with my characters. You know, again, I don't blame anybody, but, like, I'd done so many of those movies, and then people would be like, "You do too many of those movies. Oh, it's another like Kevin Smith movie, where everything's connected and shit." And so after a while, you know, I did it for 12 years, and then I put it down, and, God, did I miss it. That's all I have in this world. Those are mine. Those characters are mine, so it was awesome to open up the box and pull out all the toys and set 'em up and play with my kid and be like, "This is what I used to do before you were born. This guy would go here, and this girl would go here, and they would say this shit to each other, and then, these cats over here..." It's fun. It's beautiful. And now we got the movie to show for it, man, and it's, like, so weird to say, because I wouldn't imagine this going in, but, seriously, one of the best fucking flicks I've ever made. And the lesson in that is, I leaned into me. I just... I did me. At one point, I was like, "Oh, I shouldn't do me anymore. I should do somebody else." That's "Jersey Girl," "Zach and Miri Make a Porno." Well, now I'm just gonna do me, which sounds very masturbatory. That is pretty much the case. But... I'm doing me. Again with two men and a dream. One man and a dream. He, for years, was like, "We should do another 'Jay and Silent Bob' movie." I'm like, "No, we're lucky we did one," and then one day, I was like, "The boy is right," so here we are. You made a beautiful movie. A beautiful movie. Say something. The movie is definitely like he said. Reading it on the pages, I was like, "This is beautiful," but then seeing it, 'cause he's already cut stuff and then working with Harley, and like he said, I teared up. I don't know. I'm super excited. I wanted to pull him aside and say thanks. Again, I'm horrible talking on the camera when it comes to sharing and baring my heart. Should have played Silent Bob. Again, I can talk and tell funny stories, but when it comes to speaking my heart, it's hard. But, again, I love Kevin, and I'm so happy we got to do this. I'm like blown away we're done, and I wanted to come and say, "Everyone, that is a fucking wrap on 'Jay and Silent Bob Reboot, '" and I love this guy, and I'm gonna hug him. I'm gonna kiss him, and you're gonna see it, and Josh is gonna slowly push out and edit. But what the great thing is, guys, I don't mean to say this again, but on the other side of the camera, Josh wouldn't be here or have his fucking wife if it also wasn't for 'Jay and Silent Bob' or this guy. Thank you. He ain't wrong. Alright, guys. Thank you, man. That's a wrap for "Jay and Silent Bob Reboot." I love you. And action camera. Action, Matt. Hi. Remember me? I'm Loki, the angel of death, from "Dogma." Uh... well, I think he's mellowed a little bit. He used to just give you line readings. Like, he wrote in a very particular voice. Like, I would honor, like, every comma and exclamation point, whereas Ben was a little more fast and loose with his dialogue. And action. G'day. I'm Chris Hemsworth, and, uh, well, I've been paid to welcome you to the 10th Annual Hollywood Chronic-Con. I listen to Kevin Smith's podcasts when he reviews movies to kind of steal what he says and use them in my own interviews to sound a little bit more intelligent and educated on the comic book world and filmmaking in general. Thanks, Kevin.
