JJ (VOICEOVER): Friendship is a very delicate word, with various definitions, each holding its own personal value. Webster's definition is, "one attached to another by personal regard." This is ours. [music playing] JJ (VOICEOVER): Spanish Harlem. I was born here. That's where I spent the first 12 years of my life. My name is Juan Jose Lopez. I'm a Puerto Rican. And that's my mom. She was born in Puerto Rico and raised. She immigrated here for a better life. My father, I never knew him. Mom never spoke much about him. Alls I knew was that he was gunned down in a drug deal. It was just my mom and I. She was a very proud woman and a hard worker. She always wanted a better life for us. Today, all her hard work had finally paid off. She had saved enough money to move us out of Harlem and move us up to the Bronx, which is OK by me. It just put me closer to Yankee Stadium. 187th Street and Belmont Avenue, this would be my new home. We moved on a block which had about 30 kids, mostly Italian, some Irish, couple of Jews, and one Puerto Rican-- me. This would be the first time I met Joey Esposito and Louie Mazzarino. It was in the cards that the three of us would become true friends. Beautiful, now we got Puerto Ricans living over here. We're moving to Yonkers. Your mother made gravy. Come on upstairs. Just one more hand, dad. What'd I say? Now! What did I tell you about that goddamn landlord? They don't give a shit about us. He don't care we been paying rent here 14 years. All he cares about is money. He rents to spics. I met her in the hallway. They seemed like nice people. Nice people? Where they from? They moved here from Harlem. Nice people? There are no nice people from Harlem. Only animals. We're moving to Yonkers. Dad, can I go play stickball? You didn't finish. I'm full. Oh, you're full? When I was your age, we ate maybe once a day, and not food like this. We ate a meal like this once a week. I mean, you people around here, you eat like kings. And you know why? Because I break my ass all week doing construction so yous can eat food like this. Carmine, for Christ's sake, it's macaroni. Costs a quarter. Let him go. That's not the point, Fran. He should learn to respect money. Go ahead, go. Be back by six. And stay away from that Puerto Rican kid. Did you eat enough? Are you full? Yes, mommy. You make the best chicken and rice. [non-english] I'm scared. What are you scared about? Everything's different here. I don't know anyone, and I miss my friends. I'm scared, too. You're scared, too, mommy? Yes. Don't be scared, momma. I'll protect you. JJ (VOICEOVER): Stickball was the most popular sport in New York City. Whether you were in Harlem or up in the Bronx, there was a pickup game on every corner. As I watched, my heart pounded with excitement. I wanted to play, but they didn't even notice I was there. Joey was by far the best athlete in the neighborhood. He could play any position. And man, was he a great hitter. Louie was a great pitcher. He had all kinds of junk on his ball. That's Nicky Tomatoes. His family owned a food stand in the neighborhood. He was the worst hitter I ever saw. He couldn't hit water if he jumped out of a boat. There's tomato juice all over the bat. JJ (VOICEOVER): Bubbles Cardillo, at 12 years old, he weighed over 200 pounds. The only belt that could hold his pants up was the Belt Parkway. He was the slowest moving human I ever met. Hold, hold! Hold! I told you to hold! Pay up or asses up. Pay up or asses up! I ain't got no money! Asses up, come on! JJ (VOICEOVER): Pay up or asses up. We never had to pay in Harlem because we had no money. Shit. JJ (VOICEOVER): I heard of asses up, but never with your pants down. That must really hurt. Nail him. Ow! JOEY: Look at that, [laugh]. Let him a big red mark. LOUIE: Hey, there goes that Puerto Rican kid. What's his name? Juan, I think. LOUIE: He's been watching us all game. You want to go talk to him? Nah, my dad said to stay away. We're moving to Yonkers. Where is Yonkers? I'm not sure, but I think it's far. There's my favorite guy, hm. How was your day? It was OK. What'd you do? I watched a game. Did you make any new friends? Not yet, mom. Good night. Baby, don't forget to brush your teeth and say your prayers. Dear god, please bless my mom and please bless all my friends in my old apartment, especially my cousin Carlos. Please protect me in this new place and in my new school. And say hello to my dad. Amen. Oh, yeah, don't forget the Yankees. They need a lot of help this year. CARMINE: No way! FRANCES: Would you please keep your voice down? I don't want the whole neighborhood to know our business! CARMINE: This is my house! I'll yell all I want! They don't have to listen! FRANCES: Just this once, could we please go somewhere as a family? Dear god, please love my mom and dad. And help fix my dad's temper so he won't yell as much. Please bless my sister, Louie, and all my friends. Amen. Oh, yeah, don't forget the Yankees. Amen. [bell ringing] JJ (VOICEOVER): It was my first day at my new school. It was actually going pretty good until I ran into Johnny Ryan. Hey, chico. Do you know who I am? No. No? Well, I'm the one who you give your lunch money to every day. There I was, my first day at my new school, and this kid wanted my lunch money. I felt all alone, but I was willing to stand my ground. You gotta take it from me. - OK. - Get off me! Ow, geez! Come on! Come on, get off of me! Hey, get off of him! Come on! Move! Get off of him. Get off him. Hey, it's between me and him, Esposito. It's not fair. You jumped him. It's only six on one. Now it's three on six. Shit, here we go again. I'm not through with you yet, spic. Let's go. JJ (VOICEOVER): From that moment on, the three of us were inseparable. We all shared a strong bond. But Joey, he was special, kind of like the big brother I never had. You OK? Yeah. OK, take care. Hey, we're going for pizza. You wanna come? Sure. Come on. Hey, ma. Where you been? Oh, you make me so nervous. You know, I called the school looking for you! There was a fight, ma. Oh my god, are you all right? Come here, let me look at you. [italian]. Well, he got in a fight. Let me feel your head. He's warm. I'll make you some brioche. No, pop, not me. My friend. Let me see that eye. Hm, nice shot. I'll make you some brioche, too. JJ (VOICEOVER): Brioche, never heard of the damn thing in my life. But the Italians, they swear by it. From a sore throat to a toothache to broken bones, if you were sick, that's what they gave you. It's not bad. It's good. I can't believe your parents own a pizzeria. Can you eat all the pizza you want? Yeah. But the sauce upsets my stomach, so I've got to watch it. Do your parents own a pizza shop, too? No, my dad's a bricklayer. Any my mom, she takes care of us. - Bricklayer? - He's a construction worker. What's your dad do? My dad died a long time ago. But my mom has a house cleaning business. My dad says you're from Harlem. What's it like there? - Great. I miss it. I had a lot of friends there. And my cousin Carlos, we'd play stickball, too. I saw your game the other day. Are you any good? I'm OK. We play again on Sunday. Come down? Really? Thanks. I better get home. Let's go, I'll walk yous. Thanks for the pizza, Louie. Thanks for helping me at the playground. Hey, no sweat. How do you say your name again? It's Juan Jose. That's too hard. How about JJ? Yeah, JJ. I like it. - See you, Louie. All right, see you guys later. See you later. Hey, mom. Mom! [spanish],, what happened to your eye? I had a great day, mom. I got in a fight with six Irish kids. They wanted to take my lunch money. They what? It's OK, because Joey and Louie had my back. Joey and Louie? Joey Esposito from next door and Louie Mazzarino from the pizzeria. What pizzeria? Louie's parents own a pizzeria down the block. Louie's father fixed my eye. - Uh-huh. Oh, no. Let me see that eye, [spanish]. Mom, did you hear me? His parents own a pizzeria. All the pizza he can eat. Who? Louie! But he can't eat a lot because the sauce upsets his stomach. Mom, I love this place. OK, [spanish]. Listen, I hope you didn't eat too much, OK, because I made dinner. Go wash up. Oh, mom. Next time you go to A&P, can you get some brioche? Brioche. What the hell is brioche? JJ (VOICEOVER): I couldn't wait for Sunday to roll around. They had asked me to play stickball. Who's this kid? This is JJ. Whose team is he on? He's on my team. It's me, Louie, and JJ. Just to make it fair, we'll take Tomatoes. You're up first. JJ (VOICEOVER): So here I was, Sunday, at the schoolyard with my new friends. Nicky caught, Louie pitched, I played short, and Joey covered the outfield. This was my big chance to prove myself. Bubbles was up first and hit a line drive that spun Louie's cap. I dove to my left, and to everyone's surprise, including my own, I came up with it. Bottom of the ninth, two outs. We were down a run. Joey hit a homer. Louie tripled. Now, it wasn't that the game was so important. But I had something to prove. I stepped up to the plate. My hands were soaking wet. I was sweating. I turned my cap around so I could see the ball better. I wasn't swinging till I saw my pitch. Holy shit, what are you waiting for, Christmas? He gets two swings. Give him something he can hit! Come on, JJ, wait for your pitch! JJ (VOICEOVER): That pissed me off. The next pitch was right down the pipe. I swung as hard as I could. The ball sailed right out of the schoolyard. [cheering] We won. From that day on, it was Joey, Louie, and me. We were the team to beat. Shit! Oh, yeah! JJ (VOICEOVER): Our personalities were all different. Joey was a leader. He was a thinker. Louie was a hypochondriac. There was always something wrong with him. He always carried a bottle of that pink stuff in his back pocket. And me, I was a wild one. I could never say no to a dare. Louie, you OK? You're not gonna shit in your pants, are you? I'm fine. OK, here's the plan. Louie, you keep watch around the corner. Two whistles if anyone comes, you got that? I'll watch the back door. JJ, you go in. What should I take? Get the chickens. We'll get $2 apiece. I'll work the rope. [speaking chinese] Pull the rope! [speaking chinese] JJ (VOICEOVER): We bought a watermelon with the money we got from the chickens. The day was going great until we ran into Mrs. Calisuano. [speaking italian] JJ (VOICEOVER): Big, old Italian woman with a mustache. And boy, was she mean. Her husband died in the war. She's been wearing that black dress ever since. MRS. CALISUANO: [speaking italian] JJ (VOICEOVER): And that's when it happened. I think she's dead. [speaking italian] [screaming] All right, baby. Give me a hard 8. Shit! A 7! It's a honey. Shut up and roll. Honey, honey, give me a 7! Crap. That's it, I'm out. Why don't you bet your Twinkie? No way. You got no money because you always eating. So? Wow, who's that? LOUIE: That's Gina Peluso. She lives in the next building. Joey likes her. Hey, leave me alone! Ow, get off me! He's cute. You always do that in front of her! Shut up. Let's go to the beach. [MUSIC - LOVIN' SPOONFUL, "SUMMER IN THE CITY"] (SINGING) Hot town, summer in the city. Back of my neck gettin' dirty and gritty. Been down, isn't it a pity? Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city. All around, people looking half-dead. Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head. But at night, it's a different world. Go out and find a girl. Come on, come on, and dance all night. Despite the heat, it'll be all right. And babe, don't you know it's a pity-- JJ (VOICEOVER): This is what we call the beach, tar beach. It was our private resort, most of the time. MRS. CALISUANO: Oh! [speaking italian] JJ (VOICEOVER): Sunday became a big day at Joey's. Since my mom had to work, Louie's parents had to run the pizzeria, we had macaroni every Sunday at Joey's, which made his mom really happy. She loved to watch us eat our food. CARMINE: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing here? I'm eating. CARMINE: What are you doing here? - I'm eating. - Hey, Fran. What am I doing, feeding the whole neighborhood here? FRANCES: Oh, sit down. It's all ready. Woman thinks I got a money tree. Well, I'm glad you three bananas are here. I want you to stop bothering that old lady downstairs. I just ran into her in the hallway. She said you three knuckleheads almost killed her with a watermelon. And stay off the goddamn roof. That old lady deserves what she gets. But you should keep your pants on. [laughter] Why? What are you laughing about? I would've loved to see the look on her face. [laughter] We saw it. Carmine, aren't you forgetting something? What? Oh, oh. Yeah. I bet you three tough guys can't guess what's in this envelope. What you got, pop? What do you want it to be, Joey? Tickets to the Yankee game! Four tickets to the Yankee game. And not just four tickets, four box seats over the Yankee dugout versus Boston. Yous know three guys who might want to go? Oh, we do! Right here, yeah, yeah. Come on, yeah. Think I should let them go? Yeah, let them go. All right, you go. That's it, next Sunday. But you gotta leave that old lady alone. JJ (VOICEOVER): The Yankee game was great. It was my first time ever in box seats. I was used to sitting up in the bleachers with the pigeons. The Yankees swept that weekend, which put them in first place. The next day was Monday, school day. But we had other plans. Oh! Come on, guys! Look at that! Look at that! Oh! Oh, yeah! Look at that. Guys, we got it. Come on, help me, help me. Hey, you kids. Do you mind if I take your picture? You kids sure are lucky. I mean, no one ever catches fish in this lake. What are your names? I'm Joey Esposito. Beautiful. You don't want to go to school, don't go to school. He'll end up being like one of them wise guys on the street corner, a bum. How was school yesterday? It was OK. How was school yesterday? It was OK, mom. Let me tell you something, Juan. We did not move up here for you to play hooky, OK? Eh, [spanish]. I can't believe you let those two talk you into this. What'd you get? I got a week. Wow, I got a shot at the head and three days. Louie, what did you get? I got nothing. You got nothing? Nah. But you guys are banned from the pizzeria for a week. JJ (VOICEOVER): Could you believe it? The guy who took our picture with the fish was from the Daily News. Our faces were printed smack on the front page of the Bronx Leisure section. So what do you guys want to do now? I got no money. I'm broke. Me, too. Hey, let's go get some chickens. - Ah, the chicks? - Yeah. No way! We're already in trouble. So stay here. Hey! All right, I'm in! Same way as last time, you got that? JJ: Ow! Stop! Get off me! Ow, my leg! Let me go! Let me go! [speaking chinese] Bye-bye, bye-bye! Our luck still hadn't changed. The chinks were waiting for us. And boy, did I catch a beating in that kitchen. After that, we turned to the Lord. The body of Christ. Amen. The body of Christ. Amen. JJ (VOICEOVER): Louie's parents made him become an altar boy. They figured it would keep him out of trouble. And that was OK by us. That just gave us access to all the wine we could drink. Come on, Louie, hurry up! Louie, hurry up! Let's go! Come on. Hurry, take it, take it, take it! Come on. - Come on. Come on. - It's cold. Here you go, JJ. Go on. Go on, (sighs) You three are all good boys. Come from good families. I know all your parents. You have any idea why you're here today? There was some wine taken from the church last week. Someone said they saw you two headed for your roof, carrying two cases of wine. Now I'm only going to ask you this once, did you take the wine? Nope. Nope. I can't lie to God. I can't lie to God? My dad's gonna kill me. I got a month. I got two weeks. What do you want from me? I told the truth. JJ (VOICEOVER): Summer came and went. The new school year started. Things calmed down with out parents. Big Tony ran the neighborhood. He opened up a social club around the corner of our house. We loved to watch these guys in action. They had money, fancy clothes, and the best looking women in town. Joey loved this lifestyle, and he wanted to be a part of it. Before long, he was sweeping up, serving 'em coffee in the social club. It's great money. Beats stealing chickens. How much you got saved? Close to 200. Whoa. What are ya gonna do with it? Eh. save it. One day, the three of us are gonna open up our own business. You know, you guys should start saving too. JJ (VOICEOVER): That was Joey. Always planning and worrying about us. The three of us had a dream to open up our own bar one day. A place where all our family and friends could go. Louie started working at the pizzeria, and I started delivering, would you believe it, the Daily News. - Hey, Mrs. M. - Hey Hey, Joey. How's it going? - Very Good. Check it out, man. [door creaks] Psst. Hey, Joey. JJ, what are you doing here? Louie's waiting outside we're going to meet Gina and her friends for pizza. You wanna come? I still need to clean the car. 'Bout an hour, OK? OK. Hey-- Hey, what are you doing here? Huh? This ain't a playground here, kid. Huh? - Get off me. - Get off you? I'll kick you in the ass. Get the hell out of here. This ain't a playground. Now how come you're not hanging around with you own kind? Come here. Make sure and Armor All the wheels this time. This a double? How's it going, Joey? Sal, can I ask you something? Sure-- Sure, kid. There's this girl, Gina, and she lives next door to me, and i was thinking of maybe getting her something. You like this girl, Gina? Yeah. OK. Here's what you do. Buy her a box of chocolates. Women love chocolates. What kind? You go to Russo's on Arthur revenue. You tell the lady you want the ones with the uh, the cherries inside. Make sure to give wrap it. Are you sure? Trust Sally. Answer Do I know chocolates? - Thanks, Sally. Any time, kid. Are you fucking kidding me? Alphonse, we've been through this shit 90 fucking times already. It's simple. You borrow money you don't pay it back. Hey, Tony, look-- Not for nothing-- nobody-- y-you-- you're robbing me here. I mean-- I mean you charged me five points. I could've done it for three points from Johnny White Shoes. Hey-- hey, I don't give a shit about Johnny White Shoes. You owe me money. I don't think-- I don't think I should have to pay you two extra points. Listen to this you-- you stuttering piece of shit. A deal is a deal. Then fuck-- fuck you. You gotta wait for your money. Fuck me? [thud] - What should we do? - We do nothing. We say nothing. We never tell anybody about this, OK? OK? OK. OK, put your heads in. On three, I swear. One. Two. Three. (TOGETHER) I swear. JJ (VOICEOVER): 15 years later, Joey was working for Pauly, who ran the social club for Big Tony. Louie was making pizzas. And me? I was digging graves at Woodlawn Cemetery. . We still had our dream of owning the bar, but that dream was slipping away. None of us were able to save any money. Our stick ball game went from the schoolyard to the streets. Joey, Louie, and me, we were still the team to beat. Hey-- hey, Mr. M. How about a couple beers? - What kind? - Coldest you got. Hey, Pop. Thank you. Here you go gentlemen. You share of the stick ball game. Don't spend it all in one place. Thank you. Thank, Joey. Let me give you three guys a tip. Whatever you do today, don't go up the block. What're you talking about, Pop? Just do what I say. Don't go there. Why not? Because they're giving jobs away today, that's why. We already got jobs. Then explain to me why you're playing stick ball on the street for money, eh? Hey, Pops, give me, uh, a slice and a iced tea. Two-fifty, and I'm not your Pop. Thanks, Pops. [laughs] Skinny Sammy. What's going on? Hey, JJ, man I didn't even see you standing there. How you doin'? All right, man. You guys still playing football in that league on Sundays? Shit, man. We running that league. Man, that competition must be weak. Whoa, whoa. Weak? Shit, man. I don't see your ass out there anymore. How bout a little 6 on 6? Hey, man, check this out. I ain't wasting my time unless y'all putting up some green. How about a hundred? No way. how about 200? For a game? 200 a man. Now you're talking. Two weeks from Sunday at the high school. You guys better show up. You got-- you guys got a ref? Yeah we got a ref. All right, the motherfucker better be honest. Hey, don't sweat it Skinny Sammy. Winning team's got to give the ref $100. You guys better bring the motherfucking Giants. You always get us into this shit, JJ. Hey, I only sad 100. He said 2. Don't worry about it. [sighs] So what's the story with this bar? I didn't see it yet. Guys said it needs a little work. His brother had it 22 years, probably never fixed it up. It's been closed 6 months, since he died. So how much? It's not that much. it's even got a small kitchen, Louie. Guy said we could have everything inside, including the inventory, and we could use his liquor license until we get it transferred into our name. Plus, a ten year lease for 30 grand. Then I figured we'd get another 15 or 20 to fix it up, so probably 50. That's great. What do I gotta make? 5,000 pizzas for my share? And he's gotta dig 12,000 graves? I don't understand. You know what your problem is? You worry so much it makes you sick. No, I'm serious. Look at you. Eye drops, ear drops, nose drops. If it ain't his stomach it's his head. If it ain't his head it's his ass. Louie, relax. I don't understand this guy. What does me being sick got to do with the bar? So, are you in? Yeah, I'm in. Let's do it. Let's do it. My brother Philly had this brace for 22 years. 22 years. Now, believe me, he made a lot of money. A lot of money. That was before your time. And the women, listen, my brother Philly wasn't a handsome man, but when you own a bar, the women, (WHOOP) they love you. Sorry to hear about your brother, Mr. Slotnick. It was for the best. His kidneys were shot. Don't ever grow old. Place needs a lot of work, What work? A little paint, a couple of nails and it's brand new. We were hoping you would hold a note for the 30 grand for five years. I mean, it probably won't even take that long. Just help us get it going. Mr. Slotnick, I know if you could hold the note, we can come up the money to fix this place up, and get it open. I can't do it. I'm moving to Miami, I need the cash. You boys have my number. Think it over and get back to me. I was your age, I would jump all over this deal. Me [speaking italian] Excuse me, Don. Tony-- Tony, Connie called. She's drunk. Now I told her you weren't here, but she's on her way over. I know it. You see this, Don Pasquale? Huh? I'm leaving. You tell her you ain't seen me for a week. This is fucking broad's a nut job. I'd love to make her disappear. Come on, Don Pasquale, I'll take you home. Hey, Tony. All right - Hey, Tony. - Hey. Hey. What's up, Pauly? Nothing. It's just another aggravating day. So, what do you got for me? All right. Here's the action for today. The jeweler wants the Yanks 100 times, you want to cover it? Yeah, hell with him. He don't pay, I get a free watch. All right. Here's money from Aldo, the bus driving the chicken man. You know that, uh, skinny guy at the used car lot, down on Jerome avenue? What-- what's his name? Barry. Yeah, Barry. Look, he's late. So you save me, and I'll see you talk to him for me. OK? Tomorrow. Salute. Salute. Mm, Pauley. Remember that bar I was telling you about? I'm putting together some investors and you're the first one we thought of. (LAUGHING) You go slow, huh Joey? Look. I'd love to help you, but I'm a married man. I got a kid in college, I got another one going next year. Plus, I got a mortgage on the house, right? Plus, I'm into Tony for 20 grand. I can't do it, kid. Well, what about Tony? Forget about it. He'll ask five points. You'll end up with Tony as your partner. All right, Pauley. Thanks anyway. Get outta here. - Any luck? - Forget it. He's in the hole himself. Louie, how about your parents? - It's been slow. Plus, my pops, he hates the bar business. He's never going to do it. What about your cousin, Carlos? He must have a lot of dirty money laying around. He's got a lot of dirty money laying around. Problem is, he's opening up an after hours joint right here in the Bronx. It's all tied up. Fuck. Pauley, where is he? Connie, what are you doing here? - Where is that son of a bitch? - Shh. Will you keep it down? Don't shush me. Where the fuck is he? Look, I swear on my eyes, I ain't seen him in a week. Now what do you want from me? Oh, you are lying. You want to know what that bastard did to me? He cut off my credit cards, and he hasn't made a payment on my car in over three months. Look They're gonna take it away. Let me drive you home. - Get your fucking hands off me. - OK. OK. What does he want, me to work? Connie, not for nothing, but things have been slow. It's not like it used to be. Don't bullshit me. That cheap bastard is loaded. He told me things, Pauley. Don't think that I don't know what he's up to. I know he's got money hidden in that fake wall in the bedroom closet. - Will you-- Look Connie, let me drive you home. If Tony finds out you're here he's going to be pissed. He doesn't want to talk to me, fine, but I bet the IRS would. I bet they would. Looks like Tony's got his hands full, huh? Fuck him, he deserves whatever he gets. Must have 100 grand in that wall, easy. Probably. You know what I'm thinking, right? What are you? [non-english]? Forget about it. Why? It's our ticket to the bar. What do you think? This is a poor man's village [non-english]?? He ain't going to take off your tongue. This guy will cut your fucking heart out. Forget about it. JJ, he's a made guy. You know, I know who he is. Fuck him. He's always been an asshole. He doesn't give a shit about anybody but himself. I say, let's do it. He's taken everybody's money in this neighborhood for years. I say, let's pay the son of a bitch back. [laughs] The hell's so funny? You're nuts. You know that? You're fucking nuts. Yeah maybe I'm nuts. I don't know. Gina. Hey, you're not even dressed. Come on, we're gonna be late. Joey, when are we going to get married? We ain't got time to get married, baby, we get reservations. Come on. Joe, I'm serious. We've been dating, what, 15 years? OK, 16. I just want to get to know you better. Joseph, I'm serious. Gina, you know we're trying to save for the bar. I ain't got that kind of money. You got any idea what it costs to get married? You gotta get limos, flowers, food, wedding hall. What, between me and you we know 150 people each? I get married, I go 15 grand in the hole. Easy. I ain't got that kind of money. My parents ain't got it. Your parents ain't giving it to us. Come on. We can't afford to get married. Let's go, get dressed. I'm pregnant. What're you thinking Joey? We're gonna have a baby. So, how did this happen? Come on guys, I know how it happened, but when? How long? Almost four months. Are you going to get married? Mhm You guys can't afford a wedding. Yeah, I worked it out with Vito. I'm getting his place, a buffet, [inaudible] I'm asking Roberta to sing. That's it. When? Next Saturday. Saturday? I guess you got to send the invitations through the phone. Friends and family. Real small. How about a toast? To Joey and Gina. I've known both of you almost all my life. To two people who share so much love. Not only with each other, but with JJ and myself. And now you're adding to the family. And I just want to say that we both love you very much. And congratulations. Thank you, Louie. (ALL) Salute. Thank you. Let's eat. And what did you say? I said no. Father Riley looks Louie square in the eye, and before you even ask him if he did anything, Louie goes, I said I can't lie to God. [all laughing] JJ and I get punished for a month. Louis gets off for ratting us out. And then Old Lady Calisuano got her revenge on us for knocking her out. She was the one that told Father Riley. She must be 90 by now? Don't worry about her.

And, Barry, what the fuck's going on between you and Pauley? - Pauley? I got no problem with Pauley. - All right. Listen to me. You're a good guy. Don't piss him off. Just pay him the money. I paid Pauley. You paid who? You paid Pauley? No. I gave the money to JJ last week. You gave the money to JJ? On my kids. I gave JJ $500 last week.

You've been doing it all my life. I'm tired of it. No more. You're right. I ain't proud of what I do, but I do what I gotta do. I always took care of myself. I never asked you for nothing I ain't gonna work for Tony forever, pop. I'm going to open up that bar with Louie and JJ. I'm gonna show you I ain't a bum. Louie. Come on. Thanks for the food Mrs. E. It was great. Any time. I'll hook it up later. Hey, JJ. You missed a great meal at Joey's mom's. She was asking about you. You guys want a drink? Hey, Jay. What's going on with you, man?

I know something has happened. Don't worry. He's probably with Carlos. No I called Carlos, Carlos hasn't heard from JJ. OK. Just calm down. Me and Joey we'll go look for him. Don't worry. There's something you two should know. JJ's been doing drugs. Do you mean the coke? No. JJ's been doing heroin. Heroin? Why didn't you tell us? He said he had it under control. He made me-- he made me promise not to tell anyone. Who's he doing it with? He's been doing it with Carlos, but Carlos hasn't heard from JJ in two days. He thinks he went to Hunt's Point to cop it. OK. Listen. You stay home. Stay by the phone, and we'll find him. Don't worry. - No. I want to go. Listen to me. You stay home by the phone. If JJ calls, you beep me. OK? Don't worry. We'll find him.

But I already told that bitch, I don't know where he is. You could get killed for doing that shit around here. Yeah? Yeah. Where's JJ? I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told his girl. He's probably at Hunt's Point. Where in Hunt's Point? Where in Hunt's Point? Try Hunt's Point Avenue. There's a warehouse in the market. It's a big grey-brown building. If I ever find out you give him anything again, I'll fucking kill you. Oh-- Carlos, you OK? You OK? What fucking good are you bro? Check there. All right. Joey. He's over here. This will make him feel better. He doesn't look too good. He took a bad dose of something. His body's rejecting it. You sure he's got to go to rehab? He's addicted, Joey. He needs to clean out. Louie. [vomiting] [coughing] Sit up. Hey. Welcome back. How you feeling? I'm cold. Get a blanket. How'd I get here? We came and got you, Jay. How'd you find me? Carlos. You're sick, Jay. We're gonna bring you to rehab. OK? - No. I'll be all right. You shouldn't-- JJ listen to me. You were shooting in there for two days. If they hadn't found you, you would have overdosed. I'm not going nowhere. I'm fine. Let me go. It's OK. No. Let me go. Grab his legs. Let me go. No! Let me go! No, Louie. No. Louie help me. Mommy. [inaudible] Help me Louie. No! No!

Don't worry. [hopeful music] Hey, hey, hey. JJ (VOICEOVER): Spent the fall of '96 in rehab. Upstate New York. I wasn't allowed any visitors. I felt like a criminal. It was the loneliest three months of my life. Our dream of owning a bar seemed to be drifting further and further away. Louie and Laura had gotten engaged. And Gina, she was now in her seventh month of pregnancy. Me coming home made our family complete. Surprise! [cheering] Welcome home. It's OK. It's OK. I love you mom. I love you too. I missed you. I missed you. You look good. Thank you. Hey. Hey brother. - Look who's here. - Louie. Jay. You look good. - Thank you. Thank you. Hey, uh, Lisette gave me the news. Congratulations you guys. Thanks.

A Yankee hat. All right. Thanks, brother. - They won the series. You don't have to tell me, brother. That's all I did was follow them up there. I was getting so bored, I started watching the Mets. The Mets? You did have it rough. Hey. You know something? I want to thank you guys for everything. You guys are like my brothers. And, uh-- And I love you. And it's good to be home. Hey. It's good to have you home. Now, if you guys will excuse me, I have to go dance with my favorite lady. Xavier. Put some vodka in here. [romantic music] Baby, let's dance. Baby, I got a headache. Did you eat? Yeah. Tomorrow you're going to go see Dr. Derico. You probably have allergies. Something like that. Yes, dear. Come here. Giuseppe. How are ya? - How you doing? How's the family? Good. everybody's great. I hear you're going to be a father. Couple more months. Jesus. Time flies. I remember the day you were born. You were in such a rush to get out see the world. You jumped right out into my hands. Well, let's see what's going on here now. Bad, uh, headaches, dizziness. How long has this been going on? - Little while. Did you change your diet? I eat what I always eat, macaroni. Well, uh-- Let's take a look. And we'll see what's going on. What do you see? Nothing. [laughs] OK. Now, i want to check your reflexes. So, relax your leg. You're the luckiest motherfucker in basketball. Luck? That's skill, buddy. Watch this. You ready? Let's go, bring it on. All right. I need a rest, man. Rest? Man, I was dominating you under them boards. Hey, you know what I think, Louie? I don't think there's anything wrong with you, man. I just think you're addicted to that shit. It's good to have you home, JJ. It's good to be home, Louie. Am I gonna live? Oh, you're fine. Your blood pressure is a little high. And as far as the headaches, that could be caused by many things, stress, overwork. I'd like you to see a specialist friend of mine at New York University. Hell do some tests, run a CAT scan, check you out real good. It's probably nothing. You're the boss. Good. Here's his name and phone. Now, make an appointment tomorrow, and we should have some answers by the end of the week. All right. Thanks, doc. OK. And give my love to Gina. You got it. [doorbell ringing] Dr. Derrico, hi. Come in. Thank you. Is, uh, Joey home? Yeah, he's inside. Joseph. Dr. Derrico's here. Thank you. Hey, doc. Twice in one week? I ain't paying for this one. Hi, Joey. You want a beer, soda or anything? No, no, I'm fine. Sit down. So what's up, doc? Your-- your test results came back. Yeah? It's not good. You have a brain tumor, Joey. They call it a cerebral astrocytoma. It's on your brain stem. What does that mean? It's inoperable. Well, they have to be able to do something. Can't they give him drugs or radiation? They've had very little success treating this type of tumor at this stage. I'm sorry. I wrote a prescription for your pain. You may experience drowsiness, seizures, possible paralysis. Everybody's different. How long? Two to six months. You never know with these things. You're young, you're strong. We gotta go. Go where? We gotta tell my mom and dad. [music playing] Hey, Joey. We'll catch a flick. You wanna go? Hey, what's wrong? Need to talk to you guys. I got what they call a cerebral astrocytoma. The fuck is that? It's a brain tumor, JJ. They say it's pretty bad. There's something I need to do. I want to open a bar with you guys. I want Gina to have my end. I need you guys to look after my kid. And you, you gotta stay clean. Yeah. Sure. Whatever you need, Joey. I'll have the money tomorrow night. You start decorating on Monday. I want to be open for New Year's Eve. Where are you getting the money from? Tony. He's gonna give it to you? I'm taking it. We're going with you. No good. Remember what we saw 15 years ago. I go alone. Bullshit, man. We've been doing everything together since we were kids, man. We're not stopping now, Joey. No way. OK. [latin mass music] [hip-hop beat] [yelling] [music - "ave maria"] [mumbling] Dear God, please bless my mom, my dad, and my sister Angie. Please bless JJ and help keep him strong. And Louie. You gotta bless Louie, God. Please love and bless my beautiful wife Gina, and thank you sending us a baby. Forgive me for what I'm about to do. I have no other choice. Amen. [music playing] [knocking] It's OK. Come in. You guys ready? Yeah? Yeah. Louie, get me something to write on. OK. Hope you get this all figured out, brother. Tony's in Atlantic City for the weekend with his wife. Paul keeps an extra set of keys at Tony's house in the office drawer that I'm gonna copy. Now, Tony's house is located on Shore Drive in the country club. Louie, drop us a block away. You come back in 20 minutes. Make sure you get out of the neighborhood. They got their own security patrol driving around. No problem. OK. If we get caught, you keep going. How are we gonna get caught? We enter Tony's house in the backyard. He's got an alarm on the side of the house. We cut the wires. We go in through the side door. Now, we gotta get in and we gotta get out. I don't know if he's got this thing hooked up to the police station or not. And we gotta be neat. I want them to think no one was ever there. Now, Connie said the money was in the bedroom closet wall, not a safe. So we should be able to grab the money and go. I don't know, man. This is a long shot. We're taking the word of some bimbo. That money could be anywhere in that wall. Hey. If it ain't there, it ain't there. I'm going anyway. I don't believe this, man. We're going to rob a gangster's house, and you're writing the plans on a pizza box. Let's go. JJ: How do we get up there? JOEY: I'll lift you. Come on. Joey. What? Why do I have to go up there? 'Cause I'm older. Get up there. [grunting] Cut the wires. JJ: Keep still! Cut the-- OK, OK. Splice them back together. Why? So they look like they work. JJ: OK. Come on. Get the bag. Get the bag. JJ: Joey. [dog barking] Joey. [dog barking] Joey! Joey! Get away from me! JOEY: Shh! Get him away! Put him away! JOEY: Shh! Shh! - Put him away! - You big baby. I'll put him in the bathroom. He's a puppy! You didn't write him on the pizza box! That's not fair! Fuck! I should have switched with Louie. He's always got it easier! [police radio chatter] How you doing, Officer? Licence and registration, please. Here you go. What'd I do? JJ: You see anything? - Not yet. Here, take these. [dog barking] - Hit the walls. See if it sounds solid. It's solid. Check under the floor. I didn't come here to steal golf clubs. Wanna do me a favor? Shine a light in here, please, so I can see what the hell I'm doing. Hey, Joey. I gotta tell you this joke. There's this girl. She has a little bit of a stuttering problem, right? Her father sends her to the store every day with a note. She never screws it up. So this one day, he gives her the note to buy 5 pounds of mackerel fish. On her way to the store, she loses the note. Now she's real upset, because the last thing she wants to do is disappoint her old man. So she goes into the fish store, goes right up to the fish counter and says, give me [stuttering] mackerel. The guy says, I don't understand you. Could you step out of the vehicle, sir. - Why? - Just get out of the car, sir. Place your hands on the car, sir. You know, I got an uncle in the 24. Congratulations. She takes the same hand and puts it right in the guy's face. Guy goes, holy mackerel! She goes, yep, 5 pounds. JOEY: Holy mackerel! You like that, huh? JJ. Holy mackerel! Fuck, you found it! We found it! [laughing] Come on. Go, go, go, go. Where is he? So what do we do? We give him five minutes, we take the train. Hold it. Hey! Don't-- don't shoot! You stupid ass, you scared the shit out of us! What? Where's your car? They towed it on me. My registration was up. I even told the cop that my Uncle Pete was in the job. Nothing. Let's go. So how did we do? You're an idiot. [music playing] JJ (VOICEOVER): We found 100 grand in that little hole in the floor. That dream once talked about on our stoop in the Bronx had finally come true. To this day, I still don't know if Tony realizes the money is missing. All right, our place, our place. A lot of work. Oh my god! Huh? What do you think, huh? OK, who knows how to paint? I'll paint. Laura, you're painting, baby. Mira, que linda! What do you want? - Don't hurt yourself. - Who picked out this place? Thanks, buddy. You got some nails? Nails? Got nails for you. All right. I'll start with these-- Hey, everyone. Let's get to work. - Yeah. Let's do it. You guys painting up here? Sounds good. [chatter] Hey, Gina. Oh! Ah! [laughing] [MUSIC - JAMIE ROLLIN, "FRIEND FOR LIFE"] Said a lot of prayers. Called up the hospital, let you know that I care. Well, they say you done flipped out, drove your car into the lake. Shouted obscenities and the Lord's name in vain. So take your time, friend. You'll be all right. When you're all done healing, we'll go out every night. 'Cause you're my friend, my friend for life. Let 'em say we're crazy, two youths in the night. You're my friend, my friend for life. Partners in crime, we live a crazy life. But you're my friend, my friend for life. And I miss you. And I hope you'll be all right. High in the mountains, traveling through the clouds. We'd stare at a brand-new world we found. We'd reminisce the old town, knock it to the ground. Barroom fights and wild Friday nights. Joey. It's ready. Joseph. Joe. The eggs are gonna get cold. I can't move my legs. Hold still. [doorbell rings] Ah. Hi! - Hey! Hi, Momma! Getting big, getting big. Hey, Gina. - Come in. - Joey. Your limo has arrived. Nice suit, Joey. Is it new? Yeah. Gina got it from Frannie's Funeral Home. She wanted to see if it would fit. Joseph. Now, where'd you guys get the wheelchair from? Benefits of having a girlfriend who works at a hospital, Joey. Hey, grand opening, New Year's Eve. Let's roll. Let's go. Be careful with me. Jesus. Joey, what you been eating? You fat turkey. All right. Nice. Ready? Can you guys wait outside a minute? Yeah, sure, Joey. We'll be right outside, OK? What is it? Come here, sit on my lap. No. I'm too heavy. It's OK. I can't feel nothing. All right. I just wanted to talk to you before we got to the bar and everything got all nuts. All right. You know I loved you since the first time I saw you on that stoop. You were so beautiful. I remember showing off every time I saw you and beating [inaudible]. He hated that. You've given me the greatest 16 years of my life, Gina. You're my best friend. I want you to promise me something. If I ain't here when the baby's born, you make sure you tell him or her that their Daddy loved them. You're gonna be there. [crowd applauding] Yeah! All right, all right! There you go. So, Joey, what do you want to drink? It's New Year's Eve. Give me a Scotch on the rocks. Sal. Scotch, please. SAL: Right there. Here you go. And a cranberry for Gina? Happy New Year, everybody. Thanks for coming. GROUP: Happy New Year. Cheers. Salud. Man, we're busy. It's been jumping ever since we opened. People keep coming in. I bet we do 3 grand tonight, easy. To our place. GROUP: To our place! Yeah! Hey! It's almost time! 10-- GROUP: 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Happy New Year! I love you, baby. LOUIE: Happy New Year, Sal. - Happy New Year. Hey, Happy New Year.

Happy New Year, Tony. You three guys need anything, you just let me know. Anthony, take a picture of the three businessmen here. OK. Hey, you got film in there? Shoot away. JJ (VOICEOVER): On January 19, 1997, Joey Esposito, Jr. was born. On January 29, Joey passed away. He spent the last 10 days of his life with his son. Those were the proudest 10 days of his life. Although little Joey never got to know his dad, you could bet between Louie and myself, he knew all about the great man he was. Somebody once said there's nothing more important in life than family and friends. He was right. The three of us were a family and always will be true friends. [MUSIC - JAMIE ROLLIN, "FRIEND FOR LIFE"] You say you've been through hard times. Yeah, I know it's true. But always remember I'll be there for you. I lit a lot of candles, said a lot of prayers. Called up the hospital, let you know that I care. Well, they say you done flipped out, drove your car into the lake. Shouted obscenities and the Lord's name in vain. So take your time, friend. You'll be all right. When you're all done healing, we'll go out every night. 'Cause your my friend, my friend for life. Let 'em say we're crazy, two youths in the night. You're my friend, my friend for life. Partners in crime, we live a crazy life. But you're my friend, my friend for life. And I miss you. And I hope you'll be all right. High in the mountains, traveling through the clouds. We'd stare at a brand-new world we found. We'd reminisce the old town, knock it to the ground. Barroom fights and wild Friday nights. Rock and roll music till the morning light was all we needed to stay happy with life. And now you're gone, and it hurts me inside. I guess all that drugging made you lose your mind. Well, how can I sleep when-- when you're on my mind? I need a miracle this time. I need a miracle this time. You're my friend, my friend for life. Let 'em say we're crazy, two youths in the night. You're my friend. My friend for life. Did a lot of crazy things on a dare in the night. And you're my friend, my friend for life. Partners in crime. We live a crazy life. Well, you're my friend. My friend. Yeah, you're my friend. Doesn't matter who's right or wrong. You're my friend. Let 'em say, let 'em say that we're crazy. Doesn't matter. No, no, doesn't matter. No, no, doesn't matter who's right or wrong. Let me tell you. Let me tell you. You're my friend. [music playing]
