She was unaware of the height of ecstasy... - Unaware... Took her to the height of contentment... With my gambits and maneuvers on her body... l showed her what life is... With girls of all castes... - With... With their cuts & curves... Buddy, tell us when you go there next time. l will come with you. Hey Ranga... - l'm coming. They called me. Bhagavat Gita is essence of all Vedas. He who reads it will attain salvation. He who follows it will solve all problems. First tell us how are you going to solve the problems created by your son. l will give you the solutions. There are houses around your house. There are girls living in those houses. Shouldn't they get married? lf they have to get married, advise your son and keep him in his limits. lf you don't, no girl can live in this village. Uncle... Brother, people are making false accusations on you. Grandpa is very angry at you. Let's go & hide. Why should we hide? We are not thieves. We are lords. Father-in-law is very furious. l'm very scared. You don't have to worry. l'll pour water on the fire & put it off. You proved that dog's tail can never be straightened. Don't get angry. Don't confuse yourself by listening to others. lf you have anything to say, come to me. Why bother the old man? Tell me, what is your problem? Problem? Do we have to tell you?

And l say what he says. Escaping everytime so cleverly... Ranga, man of love... The heart throb of girls... Surge ahead, my boy... Parents without son go to hell, they say...

What happened? l placed my hand on Lord Krishna's idol to perform prayers. My hand got burnt. Heat & smoke is coming out of the idol. Something is wrong. O Lord Krishna! Oh no! Wives! - Lord! l can't bear this headache. Hail Lord Narayana! Headache to the Lord with 1000 heads? Yes Sage Narada, l can't bear it anymore. Which one amongst your 100 heads is aching? Stop your barbs Narada! My real head is aching. Real head? Eight consorts of the Lord! What are you waiting for? Give him a massage. Stop my dear eight wives! Your massage can't help me. Tell us how to relieve your pain? - Tell me my Lord! Last time when l got this pain, l remember the medicine was dust of a devotee's feet. Yes...yes... Narada, you're my greatest devotee, right? Can't you apply the dust of your feet? Oh no Lord! l'm not that worth! l'm your humble slave, l shouldn't give the dust of my feet to you, so l refuse to oblige. Rukmini weighed you with a leaf of Holy Basil plant, she's a great devotee of you, l think dust of her feet will cure you. My Lord, don't force me to commit such a great sin. l can never do it. Lord! You sang, can my Lord dare disobey me? Can you atleast? l'm still regretting for kicking you once, my Lord. Please spare my like you've spared Rukmini and Sathyabhama. My Lord! Can't you show some mercy on me? l can't in this life, my Lord. Atleast you...? Lord, please forgive us. You call me as your lord but refuse to give a speck of dust of your feet. What do you call this strange attitude? What can l say my Lord? Actor par excellence! l think you're upto some new play! Come my Lord Krishna! Come and play love games with us! Lakshmi! Why are you still here? What happened sir? Hail Lord Narayana... don't you know? Lord Krishna's idol is emitting smoke. Smoke? What to do now? Only a devotee's feet dust can cure it. Dust of feet? Lord of mercy! Cool your temper! ls smoke coming from my Lord's idol? - Yes dear. Apply this mud on my Lord's forehead. Do you want us to apply dust of your feet to the Lord's forehead? Yes, a Sage said this will cool him. Apply it fast. - Stop it! What is this Govindacharyulu? ls your daughter mad? Applying dust of the feet to the Lord on some hermit's advice? Give me way, l must apply. - No way, we'll not allow. Move! lt's a sin! l'm relieved! Headache is gone! What a great devotee Lakshmi is! She's just great but greatest devotee! You're right! She grew up before our eyes, Lord, l think it's time to think about her marriage now. l got this headache thinking about it. Why are you delaying it?

Ranga, l brought a fruit for you. l brought you twoo laddus for you. Have it Ranga! l can't live even a second without anyone of you. Mothers! Don't you feel like you've heard this dialogue before? Not elsewhere or who said it. He's the man who trapped us with such sweet words. This man only! You're right! Trying your tricks on me! Are you bringing this womaniser into an innocent girl's life? There's a reason for any action, my wife. Why l brought together a devout and a flirt together? You'll know it in near future.

King, it's not Amrita but a fisher woman. Why do l see Amrita in any woman, Astrologer? When will she enter my heart? l don't think so King, but your horoscope says you'll get a stick with Amrita's arrival. l'll not get a stick, she'll lose her heart falling for my beautiful hair. King, another boat is coming. Amrita is eternal! lt's not Amrita, but a potters woman! lsn't she? Won't she come? What's that whistle? Hey you! Who are you? How dare you call me with a whistle? - Shut up! Has Amrita come? l'm waiting for her arrival. She hasn't come yet. Why are you here? Are you her body guard? l'm not bodyguard but a suitor.

O handsome man, you've placed your head in my lap, l'm thrilled! How can he do what l'm supposed to do? lf you'd got the punch, you would've got this opportunity, right? Opportunity? Rule, men mustn't touch me. l'll get better wrestlers and prove my manliness. You're the first real man l've ever met. Don't decide a man's power in a fight, my dear.

He's here to give his daughter in marriage to you...- Mother! l told you millions of times, l'll never marry. l'm not here with the proposal on my own, Lord Krishna ordained. lf Lord Krishna had ever ordained, he should've told me. l've decided l'll not marry even if Lord Krishna himself ordains me. Don't be so adamant. They say family life is the best way of life. Please don't say no to the elders. Say yes to marriage. Last time when you forced me to marry, l ran away from home to wander all over the country. lf you force me again, l run away again. But will never come back. Did you see him? Forgive me. What's in fate has to be borne! We'll face our fate! Please excuse me. Who is he to refuse? Why should l take his refusal? Lord Krishna has ordained me, whether he accepts or not he's my husband.

He'll spit fire! lf we force him, he'll threaten to run away from home. l can't live without him. Yes dear, before we fall for your words, please go away. Mother-in-law... - You know everything about us, but we ourselves don't know about my son. We make the sun rise from west, stop the sea waves, but he'll never change. Why not brother? lf Lord showers his mercy, deaf can hear and mute can speak, you said a lame too can walk Why can't Lord change him? He can't....he can't... He can cheat Lord himself. Father-in-law!

Let's do one thing, let's start fast unto death protest. Fast unto death? Come. Till your brother-in-law comes and takes me to his home as the wife, let's not drink a drop of water also. Okay? Okay millions of times. Good! Hail Lord Krishna! Will Lakshmi who's fasting infront of Ranga's home fall for me or not? l'll see in the mirror, you read the almanac.

Didn't l say your son will bring me here as his wife? Yes dear. Sister-in-law, my Lord has fulfilled it. Mother-in-law, it's all my Lord Krishna's grace. You gave me a home full of lovely people, indeed you're the graceful of all. Son, tell me this is true. l had day dreamed about you marrying Lakshmi. Tell me this isn't a dream. Did l ask him to marry her? lt's like an illusion. Not illusion but you would've had got drunk and blabbered nonsense. You would've asked him to marry also. l can't live without... - Don't worry, l've a plan. You go upstairs. Bring him saying it's Amrita's birthday before they consummate the marriage. Uncle, come fast, let's get ready aunt. Hubby, one minute. What? - Rama Shastry & others are here. Where are they? Outside. - l'll get them. Thank God! Your sister indeed succeeded in winning Ranga's heart. That's like my sister! What's it brother-in-law? What? Today is Amrita's birthday. - ls it? Then? - She's waiting for you. Will you come? Okay, l'll come. - You must make it. Why are you staring at me? Am l good looking? Am l good or this gold chain? You! Am l good or this girdle? What if all these jewels could talk? What would they say? What? There are dumbos everywhere and you're the queen amongst them. lf they say like that l'll break these jewels. Nobody must call me dumbo other than you. Okay. Hey dumbo! Why do you need so many jewels in the bedroom? Won't they be an hindrance? l too told mother-in-law but she didn't listen to me. She forced me to wear them. l knew you'll feel bad if l wear them. Keep yourjewels in this. Girdle too! Bangles! Chains! Studs! Pins! No disturbance till morning for us... ...suddenly l remembered something. l've a small errand in the next street, l'll be back by morning.- Okay. You close the door - Okay. Why didn't you tell me it's your birthday? Did you tell me about your marriage? lnfact you had asked me to marry her. Me? Trust me, l swear on your heart. l married her on your request only. Did l ask him to marry in a drunken mood? What a great pose! With birthday wishes to the beauty! Accept these jewels as a fine. l request you to grace your humble salve. My dear wives, come here, auspicious time is nearing. Auspicious time? What for my Lord? l got them married on your request. - Yes. What's the next after marriage? Consummation of marriage, my Lord. Lord, you're getting naughtier with every passing day. We arranged their marriage, there's nothing wrong in watching their first night. The string is snapped. My heart is shedding tears watching the scene in their bedroom. You're a celibate bachelor, did you peep into their room? l didn't see for my sake but for you. You too watch it, you'll know it. Lord...? We sent in a couple of birds, right? Female bird is here, where's the male bird? Male bird has flown away. - Where? There! l planned and executed all scenes in critical Mahabharata too, but alas, l failed to change Ranga. You made Arjuna to wage war in Kurukshetra, can't you make Ranga to live with his wife Lakshmi? l think he's a far superior actor than me, l'm getting an headache again. lt's back to square one! Mothers! Give him a massage! Stop, l need a break to run the show further. lt's better to go away than live a dog's life here. What can you see out there other than dogs and pigs? Search for the lost things in the place where you lost it. lf l get into the bed of Kuchela when she's drunk, she'll melt, desires keep life afloat! Where is it? Eat this one too! l don't want to talk to you, uncle. Sister, what had actually... l don't want to hear anything. Brother-in-law! You're more concerned about their welfare! Mother... - Please no son. l had a son! Son, you were born to make our lives worth. We are overwhelmed with your deeds. What is this hubby? How can l tolerate this insult? Calm down my dear, who can change your fate? Please don't cry. Your cries can't melt that rock. l'm not sad for leaving me last night. But for your sniding remarks. Doesn't he have any freedom or respect in this house? ls he a kid? Doesn't he know what to do and when to do? Man has many things to do, shouldn't he have it? Come on answer me. Please don't teach him his responsibilities, seeing you scolding him before me, l feel... Right...it's a mistake, l don't know how to react. Call me as dumbo! l'll finish now what l left unfinished last night. Please sit. This is a sweet punishment for last night's sin. l'll do everything what you're supposed to do, you do all that l'm supposed to do. Take milk. l gave you milk, what would you give me now? Love...? Then let me devour it, yesterday's & today's. Swear on Lord Krishna. - Swear what? Swear that you will not touch any other woman with your hands which touches me. What if l don't swear? - Don't touch me. l won't have any affection on those who put conditions. l won't touch you till you ask me to. Today is Lord Krishna's birthday. lf we draw the foot prints of the lord, it's said that lord comes to our homes. Today is my son's birthday too. What should l do to make him come home? Mother-in-law, come here. Father-in-law, l'm going out on an important matter. Bless me success. Where...? Asking such question is unauspicious, right? Come brother. Hey old woman, call my brother-in-law. l want to talk to him. Not your brother-in-law. Tell them that l want to speak with her. Go & inform Amrita. This time you'll not win. - Let's see that too. His wife has come here. Excuse me. You continue my game. What makes him come to this place? Who is he? The one who got you those jewels. Are you the dumbo? Did he say that too? Not only that, You told him not to touch you, right? He told that too. Only if he swears not to touch girls like you, l told him to touch me. Didn't he say that? Then, you're not lucky enough to get touched by him in this birth. What brought you here? To know how you cast your spell on him? l spread my beauty on the bed. l allure him with songs & dance. l tempt him by biting my lips. l wink to enchant him. l take a deep breath & make him swing to my desires. l narrate him love stories. l become the bed of silk and take him to heaven. Enough! Or do you want more? You know so much. Do l have to tell you? Don't you know to offer vermilion to the married women who visit you? Stop. You need to bless while keeping the vermilion. What will you bless me? To get ruined. How dare you! You cunning fox! A little gesture of my sister would do. l will burn you & your house to ashes. Jewels are mine but she's enjoying wearing it. Says that she will wink like this. Says that she will bite her lips like this. Says that she will show him heaven on the bed. Says that she will make him swing to her desires. He goes there because of her magic spells. He is not at fault. But...l can't do all that. Krishna, you made me walk the 7 holy steps with him. But l've drawn so many steps for you to walk. O Lord! You have to set right my life. Jambhavati... - Yes darling. Keep your 18 meter long silk sari in my room. Rukmini, get your earrings, studs & otherjewels fast. Rama Ramani... - Yes. Get me your blouse. Pagini, get yourjewels. Get me your anklets. Beauties, get me your girdle & otherjewels. Sathya... Get me fake long hair to make a long plait. Why do you need women's costumes & jewels? You are women. And l your lord. First, bring those things. You will know the reason later. Rukku, why does he need our belongings? l don't know. Like Ranga, does he have plans to give these things to any other girl? What about us then? O Lord! What's all this, my lord? l need to make Ranga leave Amrita's house. This is just for that. Now tell me. O Lord, your voice...? Take bath with lover filled with exotic fragrances. Tell me something new. Stop. Will you keep walking like this always? Show mercy on us too. She produced music from a stick! Why did you lock me up with your plait? Our relationship dates back centuries. - Wow! You look different today. Today is Lord Krishna's birthday, right? - So what? lt's a festival. l heard that your wife celebrates this day in a grand manner.- Yes. How do you know that? l know everything. l also know that today is your birthday too. Looks like you know everything about me. Won't you take me to your home on your birthday? To my home? - Yes. l wish to meet your family members. - l've no problems. You once told me to get married. l got married. Now, you want me to take you to my house. That l will. But if any problems arise, l'm not responsible for it. Responsible... - l'm not responsible. You are responsible. This relationship is forever. Me sitting at the back and you riding the horse. lt's a quite new experience. Uncle. Today is Lord Krishna's birthday... lt's a divine full moon day... House decorated with rangoli is heaven... Wherever he walks through is paradise... Praise the Lord of gopikas! Praise the lord of mercy! Praise the Lord of Vedas! Praise the Lord of sacred scripts! Dressed like Lord Krishna & his gopikas, we are here to dance with the sticks... He granted me a boon. And promised never to leave me again... Praise the Lord, son of Devaki and Vasudev! Praise Lord with lotus eyes! Praise Lord of light! Praise Lord, son of Yashoda! The moon has come home after a long absence... He adored me amongst the millions stars... Eats butter & fulfills our wishes... and pours his rain of kisses... Sorrows vanished and music of happiness spread around... Now my life has taken the right turn... All world is one family said Lord Krishna... He felt amused looking at his foot prints... Walks on our foot prints, dances along with us... He corrected our wrong steps... Brought everyone together... Luck & fortune favored us... Place without His lotus feet is desert... The presence of his foot print brings joy & happiness... Praise the saviour! Praise the lord of harbinger of happiness! Praise the Lord of divine ploys! Success at last. Made him come for her at last. l've never struggled so hard till now. Jewels, sari, blouse... l'm tired carrying all those things. O Lord! Lord who carries the universe on his shoulders couldn't carry those weights. Those are twoo different things. What would a bachelor like you know? O Lord Narayana! Madam... lt's been a month since Ranga stepped into my house. He is busy with his wife. We have to bring him here somehow. And teach him a lesson. Sir, Amrita's condition is very critical. She wants to see you one last time. Please come, sir. Amrita... l'm not dead yet. l don't want to live either. l've committed a great crime to your wife. l don't understand what you are talking... You call her a dumbo. But she's an angel. But she came here few days back. She is very innocent. l committed a sin by separating you both. Unless l unite you both, my sins will not be pardoned. Let me do that and go far away from you. You said that there is only entry point & no exits points here. So, you want to leave me. l don't know how to repay your gratitude. l worshiped Lord Krishna today. Accept God's offering & leave. My debt will get over. l will live go somewhere and live with your sweet memories. This was made from Krishna Basil on the eve of Lord Krishna's birthday. Pongal. What happened to him? Go. What happened, son? lt must have been little hot. Accept the holy water. The medicine has taken control of him. He will do anything we say. Sign on this which says that there is no relationship betwoeen you & my daughter. We will go back to our village. Why are you laughing like that? What you ate now is deadly poison. Until it gets digested fully, you will be unable to bear the slightest sound. Even when a ant walks, it would be a thunder sound to your ears. Praise the Lord Krishna! - Praise the Lord Krishna! Praise the Lord Krishna! Praise the Lord Krishna! Why do the jingles of anklets reverberate Brindavan? To spread the magic of Lord Krishna's divine ploys... Why everyone worship Lord Krishna? To show to the world there's no differences betwoeen men... Why is Lord dark like clouds? To drench us in the rain of mercy... Why do cattle flock to him? To show he's the path to heaven... Stop it! Come here! Hubby! - What's going on here? A great Saint Dhyananandulu has come to our home. So we have arranged a mass prayer. You call shouting at the top of voice as mass prayer? Ask them to leave. Clear out! - Please forgive me. l'll not take anyone's advice. l shouldn't see anyone in a blink. Your eyes are closed now, by the time you open the eyes, you'll not find anyone you want. Are you happy now? No, my stomach is burning. You would've got drunk in her place again. How dare! l believed you had changed for good, but l cheated myself. l got cheated. The dog's tail can never be straightened. Why are you staring at me? l tolerated all your sins till now, but you dared now to beat your wife, l can't tolerate it. l can't live here for a minute also. Then all of you go to hell! Well said son! We deserve this punishment. Come, let's go. Hubby! All are leaving the home. Let them go! You can also go with them if you want to. Sister! You made a heaven like home into a hell. Only demons live in hell. Son, you may not conduct our funeral, so please give us atleast the holy book Bhagavat Gita. We'll think you've fulfilled your responsibility as a son. Son-in-law, l made you to live with us as l couldn't leave my daughter. You too got insulted because of us, please forgive us. Father-in-law! Dear, you go to your home along with your family. Grandpa! Sister... Lord Krishna sent you to our home, spend rest of life serving him. Brother! l can't live without you brother. Can l stay? Can't avoid it. Bye dear. - Father-in-law! Take the possession of the house before the poison spreads into his body. Come! - Stop! You're ruining a happy family. You're sending a wealthy family to the streets. You're ruining many families, God is watching. You'll pay for all these sins very dearly. Water can't put off the fire in stomach. You need another twoo days to come out of it. Why did you come here? Why are you here? l'm writing all my property to Amrita wholeheartedly. By Pundarika Ranganatha. Did l write this? lf l get into the act, you'll get a stick. Don't try to lie, this is your hand writing, your fate is in our hands. District officer has registered it with Royal seal. lf you don't go, l may have to confiscate your property. How dare you cheat me! Not cheated you, it was you who fell into the trap of my daughter's love. My sister has a message for you, all your property isn't worth of the dust of her feet. Did she say that? Then, l've a message for her too, at a snap of finger l can get better beauties than her in hundreds, and earn many times this wealth in no time, and snub her arrogant attitude. Hey....who are you? We are Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswathi. What are you doing here? We get dirty washing the sins of people, we come here on every full moon day of Karthika month, and serve Sage Mrukanda. With his blessings we get back our natural true form. at a snap of finger l can get better beauties than her in hundreds, and snub her arrogant attitude. Come with me just once! Please listen to me. Stop! Come once, please listen to me. Hey Sage! Where are those girls? Where have you hidden them? Will you give them to me or shall l kick you? You must use the legs to visit holy places only, not to kick humble men like us who wish to serve parents devoutly. You'll pay for this sin though you don't want to. My legs! What happened to my legs? They are lifeless. What happened to my legs? They have become lifeless for your endless sins. You've given yourself to desires, and deserted a devout wife, you kicked out your parents who are Gods on earth. You dared to touch river Goddesses with bad intentions. That's why you're in this condition now. Please forgive me, Sage. lsn't there any remedy for this? There's no greater God than one's own parents, there's no greater deed than serving them, Lord Shiva told this to Goddess Parvathi. The vow l've taken and the penance l'm doing is serving my parents. l don't know anything else other than serving my parents. Then all of you go to hell! You can also go with them if you want to. l forgot that mother is God... l forgot that father is God... l hate myself now, mother... There's no repentance for my sins, mother... Mother, l want to see you once and wish to die... l want to call you as father and then die peacefully... Mother...father... Mother! Mother! - Son! Mother! Mother, your dreams are my eyes... You gave your life to bring me into this world... Your blood is my handsome body... Your milk is the lifeline of your child... l was ignorant about it, mother... l made fun of a mother's affection... l'm the demon to snap the umbilical cord with mother... Even for fun don't forgive me, mother... Don't show mercy on me even in dream, father... Father, l learnt to walk on your heart... l saw the world that your finger pointed... Worshiping father is worshiping God... Father is the bridge betwoeen mother and Brahma, the creator... l was ignorant about it, father... l forgot father is a living temple... l put off the lamp of soul myself... Son, Lord who gave us to you has given a merciful heart too... Long live son taking our remaining life also... May you be blessed with a long and happy life... Father! Father, l got back my legs. My sister spent most of her life serving the Lord in this temple, please allow her to have a glimpse of the lord. lmpossible, we told you many times, the moment she married a sinner like him, we outcasted your family to enter this temple. How dare she applies dust of here feet to the idol. How arrogant! Lord, Lakshmi's condition is getting worse, please do something immediately, my Lord. Why are you insensitive like a statue? Yes, l'm a statue. l'm serving my parents, please wait! You'll be in bliss if you turn back to see. Atlast l've got a chance to serve my parents, what else can be more blissful than serving them? Turn back once and then answer me. - Okay. l'll come after finishing it, please wait there till then. Dear! How can you survive without taking water for a week? l'm worried about your condition. Don't worry father, they may stop me from entering the temple, but they can't stop me from going to my Lord. Dear! Get brother-in-law immediately saying she's about to die. Lakshmi's condition has worsened, she's on the verge of death, come immediately. She almost died to have a glimpse of the Lord. When you came to me, l pushed you away, so when l've come to you, you're trying to go away, right? Please don't say like that, l knew you would come to me. But Lord is asking me to leave without having his glimpse. What a devotion! What an acting prowess! Please allow her into the temple before she dies.- No way! lf we allow this sinner to enter the temple, we may have to do a cleansing ceremony of the temple. l think he's planning to enter temple along with her. Lock the doors! Let's do it! Lord Krishna, the almighty, saviour of the devotees... Lord Krishna! Can't l have your glimpse in this life? Lord Krishna, saviour of the world... Lord, you saved the life of Gajendra, the elephant... Come my Lord to save a life on the verge of death... Where are you going? Please sir, allow us in. Can't you understand if we say no? - Please, l beg you sir. Sir, my daughter is about to die. Please allow her into the temple. please don't say no. With prayers all around you day in and night out... Can't you hear the cries of the poor, my Lord? ln the chimes of ringing temple bells... Can't you hear the painful calls of a poor heart? Will you be insensitive like a stone though you hear the cries? lf you really hear the cries, if you really have a merciful heart... Please come my Lord... You incarnated as Lord Venkateshwara for a waiting Vakula... Hail Lord Venkateshwara! You waged a war with demon Naraka to free women in his captive... Hail Lord Krishna! She was born to serve you... She's served you devotedly all her life... She yearns to have your glimpse now... ls this sanctorum stopping you to reach out to your devotee? Won't the peacock feather spit fire if you decide? Won't there be a deluge if you order? Open the doors... Give a glimpse... Come my queens, let's play a game. Aren't you satisfied with the game you'd already played? lsn't there an end to your games? Why not? These dice are the sins and good deeds. These coins are humans. Life and death is inevitable to humans. Stop your philosophy. You said Ranga is your devotee. You tied the knot with an innocent girl. Banished happiness from their lives. ls this the result for being your devotee? if it so, nobody will ever worship you again. Why don't you say something? Please save Lakshmi's life. Don't you know it's against the nature? Didn't you bring back your Guru Sandeep's son from death? Didn't you feel it was against nature then? l just followed my Guru's request. But Ranga hasn't requested me. Make him do it. You can do anything, right? l can. l doubt if Ranga will make this request. When your wives are making a request, you're the protector of the world, can't you do it? Yes, my Lord. - Okay. Sage, l've repented for all my sins with your grace, l'll spend rest of my life serving my parents. Please bless me. You've committed a grave sin against Lord Krishna, how can l bless you? Sage! Lord Krishna himself had come to you, he appealed you to turn back and see, but you made him to wait there, Lord Krishna got disappointed and turned into an idol. What? Did Lord turn into an idol? Not only that he entered your family as Amrita to reform you, is it the way to repay your gratitude? You're great to make Lord turn into an idol. Have you come down from heaven to play with me, my lord? Did you call my name with affection? Are you angry with me for ignoring you in the service of my parents? Lord Krishna! Have you turned into an idol? Have you come to my home for me? l was ignorant to see you, my Lord... Lord Krishna! O Merciful Lord! Come to save me, my saviour... Lord has saved Ranga. Lord can do anything. He'll make him ask for a boon now. He'll bring back Lakshmi to life and give her to him. He'll never ask it, my string says so. Saviour of the world! have you come down to earth to give me a glimpse? l never cared you and committed innumerable sins, but still why did you come to save me, my Lord? Don't say it, it's my duty to save devotees like you and grant them boons. Devotee? Ever since l know, l never offered you prayers. am l your devotee? l went against my parents, l pushed my family into the world of tears, am l your devotee? l took the path of thorns as my way, l still don't know what is your philosophy? What are you actually? Why eight wives? Why all the romance with thousands of Gopikas? But still you're called as God, Not only me, many in this world have this doubt, so before l perish from this world, please give me a glimpse of Brindavan, and clear my doubt, my Lord. He brought in a twoist, a twoist that can unsettle Lord himself. Ranga, l'm here to save you and grant a boon. First ask what you want. Wish what you make and get fulfilled, boon is what you grant on asking, first Brindavan, later on... Okay, l'll fulfill your wish. Promise me you'll ask a boon later. Promise? Like l gave Arjuna a glimpse, l'll give you also a glimpse of Brindavan. Close your eyes. Residents there think and live with me, in reality l'm not there, l'm always with my real devotees. That's my philosophy. Lord, l got your philosophy. l know you accept a repenting soul as your devotee. My doubt is cleared. l want to die now, my Lord. You promised to ask a boon. Don't go back on a promise. You've to ask a boon. Ask! The boon must be granted in the presence of your wives. l've been ordered to bring you and Ranga there. Ordered? l can't myself go against them. They will not leave till you ask a boon. My dear wives! Ranga is here! What is this? Mothers! You all are consorts of the Almighty, why are you folding hands before me? All of them are doing it means, there must be something big, please tell him yourselves. Once when Lord had an headache, when he asked for dust of feet, we couldn't oblige him, but your wife Lakshmi, a great devotee did itjust like that. You're the husband of such a great devotee, that's why they greeted you respectfully. Lakshmi spent all her life serving the lord. She gave her life to have His glimpse. We wish her to live a long life happily with her husband. Ask him anything, he'll grant whatever you ask. Come on ask. Lord turned into an idol for you, he'll never say no to you. Ask a boon, Ranga. You promised to ask. Go ahead, Ranga. What am l to ask you? What boon can l ask from you? l'm your slave... l'm speechless before you... l'm not in pain like Gajendra attacked by crocodile... l'm not in a pathetic helpless situation like Draupadi... My wife isn't there to ask for riches presenting puffed rice... The Lord who gives everything without making a wish is on my side... A lord who is without any bonds is bonded to you... A lord who makes others seek him is seeking you now... He says it's in your hands, please ask him a boon... Mother, knowing about eating mud, when Yashoda asked Krishna to open his mouth, he showed her the 14 worlds, Yashoda opened mouth in awe, but never asked him anything. Did she? Yashoda who saw 14 worlds in lord's mouth, did she ask him any boon then? Cattle in Gokulam were enchanted by Lord's flute... But did they ever ask any boon? Saviour of the devotees is standing before me... l'm offering prayers snapping my holy beads... What greater thing can l ever ask? What can l ask who is omnipresent and omnipotent? Lord! Though this flute is decorated with gold, but still it is a bamboo. lt seems even dead plants will rejenuvate when you play this, but did this bamboo ever rejenuvate again? Reason... ...because it is always with you. lsn't it salvation to be with you? Mother, you wish me to be with Lakshmi, right? Yes. Where is my Lakshmi now? ln the heart of Lord. When the world wants to reach his heart as salvation, my Lakshmi who is happy there, should l ask him bring her back to life? Okay, grant me that boon, Lord. But instead of bringing her back into this world, grant me boon to reach her in heaven, my Lord. l've never seen any devotee like you. You asked a boon and made me go speechless. World sees happiness in victory, but l always lose to my devotees, and see happiness in that defeat. l'll merge you into me and make you a part of me.
