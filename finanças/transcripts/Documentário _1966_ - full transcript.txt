"DOCUMENTARY" 3 p.m. - Movies, right? - Ok. - Three hours and a half. - Yes, it's from 2:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. I don't wanna sleep in the theatre. Yesterday, I only slept for 3 hours. I've never seen a damned week like this! For Christ's sake. Nothing's up. The movie I wanted to see, you already saw. Hey, look, even the cigarette is in its end. - Are they showing that film yet? - Yes! - What about "The Dare"? - Neither. That war movie that you would like. It's English, there's only a scene that worths it. What about "The Vicar"? I think it's a Russian movie. We have to invent something, so we won't spend our days in this depression. I'm not depressed, I'm sleepy and broke. Yesterday I spent everything with those girls. Let me see how much I have in the pocket. - Is this Wednesday or Thursday? - I think it's a Thursday, right? It's capable that in cine Windsor they're showing the Beatles movie. Only next week! A thousand! With this money I can't buy cigarettes. Let's go, you pay. - Let's see "8 1/2" at the Bijou. - Italian movies, no more! Too picky! Why so much about 'em? That's not possible. I get in the cinema and sleep. I can't wait to leave. In the end, that's it. I'll finish seeing nothing. My cousin saw it in Rio, he said the other film was much better. You still listen to Fabinho? If he didn't like, it's a good one. - You're still jealous because of Silvia. - Come on! I haven't seen this girl for ages and I don't wanna see her anymore. After I've got drunk in the New Year's Eve, I throw her phone number away. - Do you still have the last "Batman"? - We have the extra issue. - Is this new? This month? - January. - Yeah, give me this one. -200 cruzeiros. Let's go, come on! Have a look... I'll take a bus to get home to sleep! I'm sleepy... Now? No, let's take a walk on Bar?o Street to see if we get something. I think I've already read this issue. Hold on, yesterday I went to sleep 2 a.m. and I'm here... At least, let's see a movie! Yes, I've already read this. We have to save the afternoon! We can't have some women, you don't have money to have a drink... what about going to Claudia's house, listen to some records? OK? It pisses me off! I can't listen to Elis Regina... Miles Davis, always the same records. Aren't they showing a Hitchcock reprise in cine Arizona? I don't know, we have to look to know! It's changed. They took off Samuel Fuller's film! That's unfair... - Whose? - Samuel Fuller. Don't you know Samuel Fuller? American director, nice... He made "House of Bamboo" and "Underworld". a color film, shot in Japan, very nice... lots of naked women in the bathroom, you saw it! Yeah... I don't remember. Let's drink a coffee. - Do you pay? - I pay. My last 100. I'm tired of being broke! Yesterday I spoke to Matias and he's going to find me a job in the Army. You, in the Army? No, no way. Yeah, it's serious. You're a guy that keeps talking stuff. Last year, you used to say. that you were going to marry: get an apartment at Largo do Arouche... No, but this Army idea is an old one. What about the documentary you would make to that TV in Argentina? Let's stop talking about cinema, ok? Let's change the subject, talk about something else. And what do you want me to talk about here in S?o Paulo? Cinema is becoming too serious. If you want to, go. I saw it already. I saw it too. Didn't you want to watch a color and different movie, now that we're here? Ok, let's buy the tickets, then. No, I wanted to see a cinemascope, color, the war ones... I'm tired of black and white movie, square screen. You can stay, no problem. I'm going. What will you do, after all? If it's money problem, I already said I pay you. No. That's not it. It's useless to throw 400 cruzeiros away... I said I pay you. I see you tomorrow night, in Bar & Bar, 8 p.m., ok? Wait. I'll go with you, then. - Did you finish your whisky? - No. I don't wanna see the kind of "nothing happens" movie. The cops only talk. There's no death. Cinema, for me, is action. The problem isn't that I'm broke, but I'm tired of watching the same thing. Every movie we pay and we think the movie is going to be something... but in the end it's always the same thing. I get out even worst. I know, I know, you said it. We speak the same, three Times more than needed. - What time is it? -5:25 p.m. I thought it was 6:30 p.m. They're the worst day time. The rest of the day it's ok, but from 4 to 6 it's a boredom. The day won't pass by! This January has been the worst in the last 10 years. It won't help to say, but we can't live like this anymore! Without revolution, we can't go on! That isn't bullshit. we have to destroy everything to start over again. Let's go, or we'll miss the 6 p.m. session. Are or aren't we going? Say anything, answer. You won't be there staring, lamenting, walking around, will you? My legs are tired! And I want to see the news! Hurry! We talk, talk, talk, and end paying for a movie, after all! Here in S?o Paulo it is like S?rgio Pinheiros used to say: "This is our famous shit generation, moviegoer". The thing is not to talk, is to act. Is it useful? I'm going in to stay for 10 minutes only, ok? I don't wanna stay more than that. Wait a minute, Marcelo! I and you don't want anything. I know the program is bullshit, but what can I do? You don't want to stay there talking... It's the false "paulista", right? That's the way it is, not only strong, but underdeveloped. Yes, did you saw it? Yeah, but the nice thing on the movie is... that all this story of being broke, not having a car, taking a bus. I don't know what else... Later it'll be a heroic act, like this... we'll be able to say to our children: "in your age, I used to walk on foot". Yeah... And the child will say "this I do by helicopter"... But the real heroic thing is doing a film without having made anything... Andrea, for example, had never touched a camera. His father gave... him one and he went to Europe to make the movie. And came out this way. I mean, yeah, but it's great, it's very heroic. And it was beautiful, right? Later, he got a problem, three machines were broke... everything broke, the battery discharged when it was in the middle... What matters is that the film is there, it's thrown over, is going to... the screen and we're not fighting, we're not stared. At least, you were witness of what happened, right? It was nice! Because the guy from Santos gave me 150 to do the film... and then he cheated me, and I was there with my money. Shooting is easy, but synchronizing, dubbing, that's really expensive! If wasn't Seu Ded?, Glauco, Mico Lorelli, Carlos and Davi... from Odil, that helped me to dub, the movie wouldn't exist... there wouldn't be anything, do you understand? It really was made without money, but it's so spontaneous. Perfect! Andrea is right. I wouldn't take the climate from here, the S?o Paulo rudeness. They have to end with the imported Nouvelle Vague style. In cinema, we can't ever do the best! We have to be happy with what's on the screen, it shoots the trouble! Next time, I'm going to make everything different. 6 p.m.
