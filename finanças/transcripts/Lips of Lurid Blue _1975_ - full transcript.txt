LIPS OF LURID BLUE Signora? George Stevens would like to have a word with you. I don’t have anything to say to Mr. Stevens. But Mr. Stevens has things to say that will certainly be of interest to you. And where is this "Mr. Stevens"? I can take you there, Signora. No... Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! That's enough! Oh God! That’s enough! Stop... That’s enough... Leave him! Understand? Leave him! Aren’t you tired of tormenting him? You have destroyed him. How far are you going to take this? How far? Death?... What do you know about love? I loved him... I still do... When I met him, he was insignificant. Now I gave him a brain, and a soul! And for what? To leave him with a bitch like you? Poor George. We aren’t supposed to be enemies, you know that? Because you and I ... we’re just a couple of losers. That’s it. The Lords grants unto you, witnesses to the faith of His resurrection, to live in the joyous hope of eternal life, To all of you today present, may our omnipotent God bless you. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Here’s your coffee. Your friends called. They’re inviting us to dinner tonight. Naturally, you lied to them. Sadly we already have an annoying but unavoidable appointment. Exactly... What a great marriage! You shouldn’t joke about that. Listen... You know, I read something a while ago, that said... marital harmony is a product of the most delicate balance. If that’s true... ...then we are the world’s greatest balancing act. Every day, each one of us... ...tries to heal from a kind of evil we’ve carried inside, for as long as we remember. Certain doctors argue that the only patients that heal are the ones that actually want to. Well, we will certainly recover then! That’s assuming we are ill... There are also imaginary patients. Well, I’m heading to the university. What will you do? I’ll come with you. We've been so silly! Our marriage ... Do you realise it has been exactly one year? Hey... isn’t this George? - Oh, yes, George… - This one? Standing next to you? Yes, George Stevens, an English antiques dealer. I haven’t seen him in years. We bought some land together by Trasimeno Lake. It seemed like a great deal back then. Fancy that... We own property by the lake, and I didn’t even know about it. No, it’s just a little shack. We went there a couple of times to shoot duck. I think... I’m going to sell it - Yes, do it. I'm not happy about it. - What? The fact that you work with ... an antiques salesman. And an English one, at that. Shall we go? Some company would’ve been nice. Are you sure you can’t stay? I have to leave for Rome on Monday. Does it have to be this Monday? Why? I have an appointment at the Ministry, but I’ll be back in the afternoon. - Are you sure? - Yes, I’m sure Don’t wait for me. I have a council meeting. All right. Goodbye. (students chatting) - Here’s your post, professor. - Good morning. (students greeting each other) Good morning, professor. Today we’re going to look at the properties of chlorophyll, deriving from mesoporphyrin. Here’s your post, Signora. "Your husband’s true love has returned from London. "From ... a friend." Goodbye professor, see you soon! - Good day. - Goodbye, professer. - Goodbye. Goodbye. "Dear professor..." "We have carefully kept you up to date with your dear wife’s stupid movements. "If you haven’t confronted her, it must mean you are still the person you used to be." Shall I serve, Signora? Get out! I’ll call you when I need you. Signora? Good evening, Signora. I’m very sorry... but the pastry chef just finished working on your cake. It came out beautifully. It’s amazing. Give it to the girl. And so we’ve reached the anniversary of your wedding. It’ll be a cute child. When will you bring him to see me? I hate children... Goodbye. How moving. The first anniversary. And now your life has slowed down. You have no style anymore. Every marriage is pointless. But yours is superbly pointless. What did you need? Your mother?? You don’t know me. No one knows you better than I do. I’ve always been obsessed by my mother’s love. When she died it felt like a liberation. She kept saying to me, "Even after death, your mother will be close to you." Just the thought of it drove me crazy. And my father - No, let’s not open that door again. I couldn’t bear it. Thank you - I’m reminded of our first meeting. - At least that’s a start... It was a peculiar period. I was unhappy, unsatisfied, unsettled. I thought I had found a true friend. A man that was comprehensive, intelligent, witty, brilliant, educated. You certainly have many good qualities. And that’s why I followed you, everywhere. Even to bed... - I’m not… - Shut it! I’ve decided to sell the property at the lake... at least my share of it. Organise it however you please. That’s the only thing we have left together. Exactly. So it was my duty to let you know. And just like that... you insist that you’ve reached your flimsy equilibrium. With a peaceful ... domestic life, standing next to a model wife. Maybe she’s not perfect. But she is a woman. And I’ve had enough, I beg you to stop interfering in my life. Sure... Sure Will you stay until tomorrow? Miss, can you get me Perugia, please? 83-471 - Signora, don’t worry. I’ll do it. - Yes. Leave it! Go and answer the phone! It’s Mr. Marco, Signora. Hello? Marco? What? But why? You could’ve let me know earlier. No, Elli. It wasn’t possible. Yes, but... It’s our anniversary... You forgot... Try to understand, Elli. Have some patience. You know about my job. I’ll try to catch the 4pm train. Yes. I’ll arrive at Perugia around 7 o'clock. Yes, I’m still at the hotel. At the bar. All right. See you tomorrow. Bye. Bye. Hello? Is this the Hotel Flora in Rome? I’d like to speak to Mr. Stevens, please. - Mr. Stevens, telephone. - Thank you. Hello? Hello? Hello?! Goodbye, George. - Can I help you? - No, I'm waiting for the train from Rome. But ... there are no trains until tomorrow morning. - All right. - Good evening. Signora ... this is the Waiting Room, in case you want to wait there. - Thank you. - You’re welcome. Marco... Dressed like this, you must be cold. - Yes. I've been here since yesterday evening. - What? Why? I wanted to pick you up. I was scared I would fall asleep. - No! Let me go. - You are my wife, and you must do as I say! No! No... Why? - Mr. Marco. - Yes? I'm Laura. Laura? I remember you when you were this tall! Have you met my wife? Hello, Laura. My husband has told me about you. I know your parents have been helping his family for a long time. Yes. I cleaned the house a bit. I know you come here every year in the summer. That wasn’t necessary, thank you. By the way, someone telephoned for you earlier, Mr. Marco. - Really? Even here! Who was it? - From London. It was a Mr. George. I would like to ask you a favour. First, I’ll ask you for one instead. Don’t be formal with me, as if you were still little. Then it'll be easier for everyone. I will try... I wanted to ask you, sir, if I could stay here until I find a new place. But Laura, this is your house! You were born here. So were you. - Look... it’s Grillo! - You still remember him? How could I forget? He was my childhood nightmare. It’s already 6 o'clock. The days are becoming longer. - Nice watch! - You gave it to me for my first Communion. Ah!... There he is... The virgin boy... Come here, cutie... Come on! What? Are you scared now? Get over here! If you knew how many boys I’ve taught before. Nowadays men will even fuck a cow... But... But I... I’m sorry... I said I'm sorry! Did you come here to fuck or not? I’ll come back tomorrow, I promise. I really like you... Oh... I understand that you like it, dear. But I have some unfinished business for you. But I will come back, I promise! - Listen... - Hm. - You won’t tell anyone, right? Me? I’m a tombstone, baby boy. - Oh! How did it go? Did you like it? - How many times did you do it? Look at him! Who did you bring me? I think this one has different tastes... I know what I’m talking about. Send him to the priest... My son! You have to fuck! You have to fuck! You have to be a man! Like me! I’ll beat you until you start fucking. Take your foot off the shoe, Signora. Here, lean on me. - Thank you, very kind. - You're welcome. May I? I’m David Levi. Alessi. Do you like the show? Well, it’s the same old thing. - Shall we get closer to the stage? - Sure, let’s go. Hey, Nora. I have a hat for you! - Hello. - Hello. - Hello! It's cute, isn't it? - Yes. - Let’s go for a walk? - Sure. You should stay away from that guy. He is a former prisoner, an outcast. But... I thought he was charming. I even invited him to our house. It's up to you. I think it would be very interesting to watch it from up there. Yes, I’m still doing some construction, so it’s a bit dangerous. - However, if you want to, it’s my pleasure. - Sure. Thanks. - Will you come with us? - Yeah! - That's all right? - Of course. Thank you. Over here, Signora. Just watch your step. - Slowly. - Yes, I got it. - It's dangerous if you’re not used to it. - Yes, of course. Slow, take it easy. Here, let me help you. Over here, please. - Over here, Signora. Watch your step. - Yes, don’t worry about it. Nice and easy. Maybe it’s better... Listen, Signora, it’s better if you go first, as a precaution. In case you slip... That's fine. I’ll go first. I’m sorry I made you climb all the way up here. - Nonsense, Signora. - You can see them better from below… What do you mean? The young girls' legs... You could see just about everything. You’re not holding the ladder. Why did you make me climb first? I was right. It’s beautiful from up here. Look at them, below... Look at all of them all. Everyone bursting with desire... Just think... ... all these people, with only one thing in mind. Look... All of those beasts with their obsessions... And you?... Why don’t you take your opportunity to do what you want? Take your chance... - Laura! - Let me go! Let me go! - I made an advance today… - Yes? I sold the property by the lake, the one I owned with the Englishman. Come in. - May I go, Signora? - Yes, yes. You can go. - Where is she going? - To the cinema. Why did you sell it? It had no use anymore. Not even ducks go there anymore, with all the tourists, the trash. And it’s all covered in shit. Just like me. Now I’ll have to sell the country house - since you’ve managed to shame me there too. You've always wanted to be used by men. But now you have to stop. It’s enough! Do you understand? I’m talking to you. Yes, yes... tell me about the other woman who lives inside you… Always on the ambush, ready to wear you down, to destroy you. "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" One is ready to welcome my help, my love, ... so that the other can wallow in her own filth. No... It’s not like that... No... You can’t think about it like this. It’s not that simple. I don’t need excuses. I wouldn’t even know how. How would I explain to you that in those moments, everything ceases to exist. Yes, I am conscious, but... as bad as it is... I can’t do anything about it. It’s as if my will abandons me. And afterwards, I just want to die from the shame and hatred I have for myself. How can you not understand?! You can’t understand? Or you don’t want to understand, Marco? It’s as if I were two different people. Yes, continue to hide behind the alibi of duality. That way it’s easier to explain. Everything is easier. But you are a whore. A dirty whore! No, I’m not a whore! I’m not a whore... It wasn’t my choice. You don’t know how many whores I’ve met at all those parties, with countless wedding rings. I’m not a whore like that. And I don't have any illness. I don’t want to be ill, understand? See ... I’ve always thought… I thought we could help each other. I’ve always truly believed that. I was sure of it. What an idiot I was. What must you think? Do you think I’m not also disgusted? - About yourself? - No! No, about you. What should we call your friendship? Unusual? Because everyone knows about it, you know? Everyone... The difference is that when I came to you… I always told you the truth, everything, from the start. But you... You didn't tell me that you loved a man. What should I call you? Homosexual, or queer? And you made a fool of me, because I didn’t realise anything. - Elli… - No! No, it’s enough already! Go talk to them! To your friends! I came to you with so much humility and loyalty, completely ready to believe you. I came here, and I was in a bad place. But my problems are the same as yours. This is the truth, Marco. This is the truth! And you question my morality. Mine! As if you're a puritan. You of all people… Must be Nora. I’ll go and check. It was just the wind. I’m going to buy some cigarettes. - Hold on! - I was just closing. Just a pack of cigarettes, please. (men argue in the background) Can I have a pack of Marlboro, please? And an orange pop too. Can you give me a light? God damn... What a behind! - What do you have? - Nothing. Nothing. Swords and Cups. - And what have you got? - I have an ace all this time... It looks like they’re talking to me! Go fuck your sister! You are so pretty. - He's an idiot! - Never mind. Just go home. What the ...? My God, has he gone mad? Are you crazy? What the hell are you doing? Stop it! What did he do to you? I won’t say anything. Get up! Go on - close the shop! Sing. Come on, sing. Show who you are. Let’s put her there, come on. Express. Good evening. The usual. Good evening. Thank you. What are you doing here? I’ve come to Perugia for a few days, and I know your habits. - This isn’t a chance encounter. - I’d like to take a walk with you. Marco, I must talk to you. I already told you, back in Rome, that I would sell the property by the lake. No, it’s not about that. Remember how many times we walked these streets, returning home... ... at night, for years, talking... Listen, George, we've remained friends. Yes, we have. But we couldn’t reach an agreement, and now our friendship is at risk. I’ll wait. Marco, you must leave that woman. "That woman" ... who? I beg you, Marco. I know certain things... - That woman is not for you. - It’s my wife… - Marco, please don’t… - Don’t touch me! I didn’t want to say it, Marco, I swear. It’s been months, believe me. - You could have spared me. - No, I couldn’t. Get on your way. - We are still friends, right? - Just go! Marco, I beg you... Just leave her... - I love you… - You disgust me, thank God. - Do you know who she really is? - Leave! So... you want to know the whole story? At Mile 167 on the highway there is a pub. The other night, your woman got herself fucked by four old drunks on a pool table! Worse than a cow! Worse than a cow! I told you to leave. Don’t come to me ever again, or I will kill you. I will kill you! And now, what? Nothing. You shouldn’t have come here. After our last encounter it was obvious that I didn’t want to see you again. - But I had to. - No, you did not! Fancy coming here, to my house! Are you trying to provoke me? This decision, to come here, to leave everything behind... your life... your job... - ... it’s like suicide. - It is. What’s the point of this life? There is none, either psychologically or biologically. Just the idea of a sexual encounter, for example ... makes me shudder. Or even laugh. What does that mean? Just think ... I once thought you were so stupid as to consider having a child. Just to give your life some meaning. Elli needed me, and I needed her. Elli is the only person who could've ... No ... who can help me. A woman who is not stupid, may sooner or later find a wreck of a man, ... and try to save him. Sometimes she will succeed. But... if such a woman finds a healthy man, she will reduce him to shreds. And she always succeeds. That is from one of your writers. - Oh! What the hell are you doing? - Me? Nothing. You? I’m doing the roots. Why did you stop working? I was tired. I’m going to have a rest. Listen... Hey! Where are you going? Listen. Hey! Hey! Listen to me. Where are you going? You’re crazy. Wait. I have to tell you something. - Listen, what’s wrong? - I don’t like the look in your eyes. - My blue eyes? I can tint them if you want. - It’s the way you’re looking at me. Try it again and you’ll get kicked. You know where... - Move your hand! - But… why? Is it possible that you don’t like me at all? If I don’t like you, at least I never told you. Oh, okay... Where are you going now? You always make me run! Wait, I still need to tell you something! Wait! Nora! Nora! Hey! Better luck next time! I’ll get you next time! You’ll see! Catch you later! You'll see! My friend, George Stevens. This is Elli, my wife. - Could you get us some coffee? - Of course. It’s quite late, my dear Marco. I think I have to leave. - I will explain to Elli. - Thank you. Goodbye, Marco. George... a favour... Don’t come back again. I’m not having coffee. I saw your friend George leave. Forever. Anyway, I have a problem with you... I’ve invited you countless times to my house but you've never come. Well, you see, I live a very solitary life. And I didn’t think your invitations were... serious. All right, well now it’s official! Tomorrow we’re having friends to dinner, and you’ll come too. Or do you need a written invitation? People have told me that... that you... ... were an outcast. Well, it depends on your perspective. Maybe those who say I’m an outcast don't realise that they’re the outcasts themselves. If that’s what it takes... I consider myself an outcast as well. You don’t look like one. They also told me you’ve been in prison. Yes, it’s true. I spent a few months inside. But I’m neither a killer nor a kidnapper. I’m sorry to disappoint you. - So…? - Oh, nothing serious. I wrote against the leader of a small yet powerful state. It was only a few months. It was all about nothing. And people now consider you an outcast for this? Who told you this? That idiot Lupis? The fact is that, I hate many people. - Do you feel superior? - Of course. The freedom to think brings a certain intolerance. By the way, tomorrow evening you will meet some of these people whom ... you despise. Would you be sorry if I didn’t come? Yes. Very much. Look how much these people drink! You’re talking like a city girl now. When Perugia was crowded, I certainly had fun. Pretty girl! - I’ll fucking stab you! - I’m just playing! - You’re always touching me! - Oh, well… come on now... Hey, come here! You know you’re prettier than your boss, right? Then touch her instead. She could probably help you. But... I just need you. That’s all. - Would you like something to drink? - No, thank you. Could you answer that? Excuse me one moment. This sad countryside brightens up when you’re around, Signora. I’m very happy that your husband invited us. - May I introduce my wife. - How do you do? Please, sit. Go, go... Finally, my suffering is coming to an end. It was wonderful. And now here you are! - From now on, it will be sublime. - I don’t know what you’re talking about. Don’t be afraid. No one will ever know. - Good evening. - I’m happy to see you. - Come, I’ll introduce you to everyone. - No, no… later. I already know everybody. All right. If it doesn’t hail this season, we’re going to have a great crop. Let’s hope so What’s there to like here? Countryside, bars, family, television - and then what? A few of us remain, attached to the land. We are real men. What a clown! You were right. Shall we go for a walk? And what are you doing now? I’m not working. I don't contribute to society. When I was younger, I loved to shoot around these parts. Out of nostalgia, I built myself a summer house, right there, just behind the hill. It’s a beautiful place. I spend a lot of time up there. - You like solitude? - No, not especially. But I’m not afraid of it. Well, I like it, but it scares me... - But you’re not alone - You think? Mm. We’re all alone. See how strong I am! - Nora… - What? - Let’s talk - Talk, then! Let’s have a serious conversation. In depth. What do you think? Here we are. Put this there... - Nora - - I already know what you want to tell me. Oh? And what's that? I'm just waiting for you to ask me in the right way. Oh really? You have beautiful hair. - Do you know that I saw you naked? - When was that?! The other night, when you were undressing. You left the blinds open, and I saw you, behind the window. - And what did you think? - You are beautiful. - And you didn’t have your panties on. - Liar! I always have them on. What do you mean "liar"? I’m telling you ... I spy on you every night. You even have a mole right there. Still don’t believe me? - Dirty bastard! - Me? No... - And what now? Are you sad? - Yes. Tonight, I’ll leave the windows open again. - Really? - Mm-hm. - All right, good. Come. Come. Come here. Come here. Quietly. Quietly. Hey! What are you doing? What are you doing in here? Disgraceful. Disgraceful. - No, no! Alberto, what are you doing? - Stop! You don’t understand... - Let me explain, Alberto... - What do you want to explain? I’ll kill you! - No, Alberto! - I will kill you! I'll kill you! Get out of here! I’ll kill you! You whore! Whore! Where are you running to? Come here. You whore! Alberto! I’ll help you, Marco. I’m here for you. I'll help you. Unbelievable! - Where… Where will you go? - Leave me alone! Leave me alone! You all disgust me! To ... to me?? You say this to me?! What have I got to do with this? Nothing! It’s they who... - Can I come with you? - Where? I don’t know. To your mother’s? - Bring the case, then. - Hey! Wait for me! Nora! - Does your mother own chickens? - And rabbits too! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Did you shoot anything? - I don’t shoot. - Eh? I said I used to shoot, many years ago. So many people die all around the world. Let’s leave some birds alone, at least. Then, what do you do here? I read. I go to the woods. Not much. Please, come in. I can make you some coffee. - Sit. - Thank you. Is something wrong? No, it’s nothing... Or maybe it’s everything... If you want to talk, we can talk. During my time in prison, my cellmates and I got fed up sometimes... ... and we just let it all out. We talked about our most intimate problems. It helped a lot. Maybe it can help you as well. I don't think my problems would be easy for you to understand. They would annoy you. - Or maybe you’d be disgusted. - My dear Elli… can I call you this? We’re already up to our necks in disgust. This would be just a drop in the ocean. It feels good to talk to you. Who knows why? You meet a person, and everything seems so easy ... effortless. Yes, I wish I could talk, really. Let it all out. But I know it’s no use. Actually... Certain things are, let’s say... too much to handle. I’m happy here. I’m happy with you. I feel really good here. I want to be your friend, nothing else. You see, friendship can be a beautiful refuge. You’re right. So if you want a good cup of coffee, you can always come by my place. To tell you the truth, the coffee is terrible! - Next time, I’ll make it myself. - Fine! - You love him, don’t you? - What makes you say that? The fact that you’re here. I know you were very close to Professor Alessi. I know everything. Marco is suffering. The great scope of life is sensation. The sensation of existence, even in pain. Tell him that, he will understand. Maybe Elli has found a man, for whom she has feelings. With this man, she's different... not like the other times. This might change everything. You have to force him. You have to force Marco to watch, so he realises without a doubt that this woman... ... is destroying the last thread of hope which he... ... unconsciously still clings to. Do it! It might even be risky, but it’s worth it. There is a line by Baudelaire. Do you know it? "... The Devil directs our every move. "Day by day, towards Hell, we descend step by step." - It’s sunny outside. Why don’t you go out? - Leave me alone. There is something you need to see. - There is nothing for me out there. - No. You are afraid. Afraid of something you could never imagine. It’s been a while since I’ve stopped imagining. Come and discover something you would’ve never expected. Love. It’s hell. I didn’t think I could ever be this happy. I didn’t think I even had the right. I, too, feel... how can I say...? I feel good inside. I know I’m about to say something absurd. But I wish that we would never have to leave each other. Never... But we have to. It’s not easy for me. - We cannot be together. - But why? I don’t have any choice. I’ve already made up my mind. By this point, solitude is a necessary evil for me. If I stay here, I could lose the most important part of myself. I know you will think this is just silly romance, or an excuse. But I have to do this. I would go to the ends of the Earth in order to finish my book. If I stayed here, I wouldn’t be able to help you, because I would have to change. Therefore I wouldn’t be myself ... but a stranger. Maybe you’re right. But I have to tell you something. And I want you to believe me because it’s very important to me. You see... I have never loved, never... It’s a new world for me. But I... I do realise... I don’t have much to offer you. And I can’t represent anything for you. On the contrary. It would be easy to find a reason to live with you. But when one's entire existence is tied to a choice, ... and one concentrates all one's strength and will on that choice... it can happen that inspiration is sacrificed. One doesn’t think about it, but then one finds one has to pay. And one discovers that one might seem selfish, even to those who would have never thought it. A man like me must know how to dare to remain alone. Well, I can still hope, right? And I will wait for you, as they say ... with no strings attached. All right? When do you leave? Tomorrow. I love you, and I will wait for you. (The Lord’s Prayer) Poor girl. She was so beautiful. You were very close. No... No... Elli... Signora. Professor Alessi. My condolences for the girl who lived with you. This - let’s say "accident" - shouldn’t have happened. We are convinced this was not an accident. We’re also sure about the killer’s identity. We did not pursue other suspects when it was clear that David Levi could not be traced. - No! - We are still investigating. Good day, Signora. Good day, professor. Let me go!
