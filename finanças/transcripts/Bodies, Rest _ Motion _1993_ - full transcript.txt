We're movin'. What? We're movin'. We're gonna move. When? Two days. In two days? Yeah. Not really. Thanks for the news. I haven't known for long. I just decided, I decided on Butte. Butte, Montana. What do I need that makes me make these decisions? You got me. -Yeah. What does Beth say? Beth? She says... Beth says whatever makes me happy, that's what she says. How long a drive is it to Butte? With me driving? Twenty-two hours. That's not bad. In my car? It's a fuckin' nightmare. And there's no good radio in Utah. -It's all religious programs. -Get saved. No thank you. Uh-uh. Think about this. Take a detour and go through Vegas. Kick off the trip. You and Beth can have a nice, romantic dinner, see a show, play the slots, get the free drinks. No, that's too much money. The show, the meal, the slots. Then there's the hotel. That's another hundred down the toilet. No! You skip the hotel--it's night. The highway's empty. You, uh, you start speeding. 'Cause you've got a little buzz on. You get stopped in Utah by the cops. You flunk the breathalyzer. They haul you in. The judge is Mormon. Ugh! You get 15 years. You go to prison, but at least your life has taken a direction! Hi. Hi! Hi, honey. Hi, honey. -Bye. -Bye! Lunch tomorrow? I'm all yours. Wait--make it mine, I've got the short shift. Do you want me to come over after? Help pack? Yeah, that'd be great. I'm--I'm really-- I'm really sorry we didn't tell you any sooner, it's... he just... Yeah, oh, I understand. Bye. Fuckin' Nick. I'm tired, I'm going to bed. What's your problem? I haven't got a problem. Okay. You agreed to try Butte. Yeah, I know--Butte, Montana, city of the future. Yeah, I read that a while ago, so the future's probably already there. It's not like you're leaving anything behind, a good job or something. No, just some friends. You'll make new friends. I know. I'm not eight years old, I know I'll make new friends. So what is it? Uh... it embarrasses me. I mean, the way that you and Carol are together sometimes. She's my best friend and it embarrasses me that you used to live with her. That was years ago. It was three years. Yeah. We're moving, so... she won't be your best friend anymore. Livin' with someone isn't such a big deal. Anyway, I live with you now. Beth? Beth! Beth? What? It's rainin'. It does that. Since we got it? No, lately. Shit. What's wrong with it? Water comes out. Shit. I hate this shit. Never kept the coffee hot, and now this. It still works. No it doesn't. Water comes out. Okay. Coulda got a new one on my discount but it's too late now. -Want a doughnut? -No. I want an appliance that works. This coffeemaker is junk. Blender is junk! Our TV is junk. I don't know why we're even bothering to pack. You got me. Can't believe we don't have a good TV. Well, we don't watch much. Yeah, but at our age... Why don't you take one? Ain't hungry. Not a doughnut--a TV. I might do it. I say do it. They can afford to give you a bonus. Maybe they are. What do you mean? Maybe when I get my check today, there'll be a bonus in it. Nick, they fired you. Yeah. There's no bonus. Yeah. And I sold a lot of TVs for 'em. I should go. Don't wanna be late on my last day. Gotta go. Hot enough for you? Hey, Chip. Supposed to hit 110. Yeah, well, it's good practice for hell. I'll remember that one. Hey, um, I heard that you're leaving us. Yep. I'm outta here. They can you? That's what they think. Yeah? Yeah, I was gonna quit anyway. This way, I get unemployment. I'm not stuck waiting around for the layoffs to start. Layoffs? -Who are you? -The painter. What are you doing? Painting. Well! Good morning! You. Sid. Nice to see you again. -Why are you here? -To paint. Realty office likes a fresh coat between tenants. But we're still here. Well, they said you'd be gone. We're not. I've done this house before. Did a pretty good job. Won't have to redo the trim. Oh, fuck--could you come back tomorrow? Tomorrow's Sunday. Yeah? New tenants move in on Sunday. Where you movin' to? Um, Butte, Montana. Why? Can't be any worse than Enfield,Arizona. I've lived in Enfield my whole life. You hold this? It's masking tape. I use it to mask. Do you ever use masking tape to mask? No, I haven't. Sorry I'm late. The new girl is a moron. What's that? A going-away present. Thanks! A map. I thought you might need it. I do. I had a map, I lost it. Let's highlight your route. Okay. Here's Enfield. Here's Butte. Where? Right there. Okay. -Look at that. -What? -Right there? -Uh-huh. Halfway? That's the town I was born in. Where I grew up, where my parents live. Isn't that a coincidence. Visit 'em. Nope. You're gonna be driving by. Nope. They're not near the interstate. I haven't even called them in years. You might as well visit. Nope. Why not? Wouldn't know 'em. Wait, let me. Pretty good. I'm starving. -Oops. -Hello? I'm lucky I don't have to kill 'em. What? If these walls were any darker, I'd have to put a layer of Killdown first so that the old paint wouldn't bleed through. Oh. Yep. Kill is an alcohol-based paint. Covers the old paint so that you'd never know it was there, but-- but when it's drying, it gives off these fumes. The fumes are noxious. Noxious fumes. They, uh, they'd probably find us on the floor, unconscious. "They"? Yeah, the "they" that find people unconscious. -Nick. -Nick. Nick, the man I live with. I guess he'd be the "they." Yes. He'd find us, and he'd be surprised. It was the drive that killed us. Ugh. San Antonio to Seattle is just too many hours in a car. -If we'da flown, we'da made it. -No! Things were all right in bed. Yeah, but the rest of the time,they were awful. -Really? -Yeah! Nick, we couldn't stand each other. When we got to Enfield, I dumped you, and, uh, we just stayed. Why didn't you go on to Seattle?It was your car. Big trees scare me. I'm thinkin' about stealin' a TV. What? I'm thinkin' about stealin' a TV! Good! I'm, uh, done in here, except for the ceiling. But I'm gonna hold off on that until you've got your furniture out. Uh, I don't think we're gonna betaking too much of the furniture, though. No? How come? It's ugly. No it's not, it's... That's fine, it's--it's a pretty good-looking couch. Oh. It's not a couch, it's a sofa bed. And it weighs 2,000 pounds. Wow. It's not--it's not ugly, though. I-I tell you, we had a sofa bed when I was a kid, it was the world's ugliest sofabed, it was orange and red and purple stripes. Phew. You're not gonna take it, you're just gonna abandon it? Wow. Can I have it? It's yours. Excellent! Nick's gonna steal a TV! Who are you? The painter. He's really gonna do it? He says yes! We have to talk. About the crime? There's no crime. Nick's gonna steal a TV. That's just an expression. I've never heard that expression. It's makin' the rounds. College students use it. Where's he stealing it from? -His mall. -You want him to know? He knows! He doesn't care. Do you care? I'm interested. Crime's interesting. It's not a crime. -It's justice. -It's poetic justice. -How? -They fired him. He's got motive. -Who is this guy? -The painter. -Sid. -Sid. He needs you at the store. He needs me? You lookin' or buyin'? This is what you do? I also mow lawns. Which is your career? Painting. I'm an inside person. Not a lot of lawns in the desert. That's true. You've got a subtle tan. Why, thank you. Do you wanna get stoned? Yeah. This kinda painting-- Mm? For people I won't know? It's boring. Really? It's not very good. It's homegrown. -But it'll get you fucked up. -Really? Oh, it'll take you someplace. We'll see. -Thought about American? -Nope. I own an American set. I'm very satisfied. I want Japanese. Now, you see, the thing is, the thing is... $150 gets you very little in the way of Japanese technology. Gets you that TV. It's for my parents. -Your parents? -Yes. Is that a problem? No, it's just that, you know, I never... 'scuse me. Miss, I've got your receipt. Oh, great. It's all you need. Thanks. Just...take your receipt, out back at the loading dock, and they'll give you your brand-new, beautiful TV set. I get the TV? Out back. They'll help you load it in your car and everything. Think about American. Mostly Japanese parts, anyhow. Excuse me, I just-- Miss, I'm dealing with this customer here. Perhaps you'd like to ask someone else. You mean you can't help me? Not really. No. It's very small. Yes it is. Excellent. Maybe I should just leave it packed. What? Oh, come on! You stole this, you gotta look at the loot. Come on. Here, you hold the bottom and I'll lift it up. It'll be easy. Wait. Thought I heard the police. Ha-ha-ha! What? -What? -You're stoned. Me? You are stoned! Busted. Busted is right, Mr. Bunny Eyes. I can't believe that you're painting my house stoned. Well, I'm just..I'm just a little stoned, but... -Oh yeah. -...I'm not that stoned. -Oh no? -No. Carol is really stoned. You got Carol stoned? Very stoned. I didn't think she liked you. She doesn't. But she likes getting stoned. She does. There's nothing like drugs to create a quick and shallow friendship. Wow. You didn't fool around. This is the nicest thing I've ever owned. -Nice speakers! -Yeah! Fuckin' Nick. Hi, kids. -Hola! -Hi! Come see. I should've had him steal me one too. Well, you can come over and watch. -You're moving. -Oh yeah, right, right. How's the painting going? Too many distractions. I'll be at it all night. You have bad work habits. Not when I'm actually working. I better get set up in the kitchen. It makes TV seem very futuristic. Because you're stoned. I'm hardly stoned. Need some eye drops? It was homegrown! Gets the red out. Thank you. Need help? Yeah. Okay. Tilt your head back. Beth. Stop moving. -Got it? -Got it. Next eye. Wait a minute. He really wants to get in your pants. My pants are taken. -Why don't you go for it? -He likes you! Got it. Where the hell's Nick? Probably getting drunk with the stock boys is probably what he's doing. Beth. Listen. He's gone? Yeah. Where'd he call from? He said the highway. He said he would've called you but your phone is disconnected 'cause you're moving. Do something, I've gotta do something, do something. I mean, I've gotta be out of here tomorrow. I gotta be out of here on Sunday. You can come to my place. No, I mean, I...I just... He's gone. He's gone. Fuckin' Nick. Fill 'er up. You live there? Nah. Closed at 7:00. I got no one to shop for. Shit! Fuckin' wind. Yeah. So what does it mean? -What? -The wind? High pressure field coming in? Not like that, you know what I'm asking. You're an Indian, right? -I'm Navajo. -Yeah. So you're in tune with this stuff, right? Thirteen bucks for the gas. All right, here's a-- here's a twenty. So what does the wind mean? You know, like an omen or something? Uh, change is coming to the people, spirit of freedom is walking the land? -That kind of meaning. -14, 15...and 5 makes 20. The wind? It's just the wind. Like I'm just Navajo. -So that's it? -Yeah. Shit. Be better if it meant something. Yeah. He said he needs to be alone again. He needs to learn about himself. To make a fresh start in a new town. He said he was sorry. Aww, he's an asshole. He's always been an asshole. You'll be all right. Yeah. I'm here. I know. Ready for another? -Oh no, no thanks. -We're fine. Nick comin' in? ...his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. And the son said unto him, "Father, I have sinned against Heaven ..." You've lived here your whole life. Yeah. You've never gone anywhere. Traveling has no allure for me. None? Maybe through time. That's not offered. So I stay here. Why? It's my home. I belong here. I'm serious. My father says that if you stay in one place long enough, then your luck knows where to find you. Well, maybe that's my problem. Maybe it is. Sugar? Think your father knows the truth? He's a bartender. Oh. He's lived here his whole life. Are you all right? Yeah. Just must be the paint fumes. It's a pretty moon. Yeah, I guess. Hey, Beth? Mm? Leave it behind. Leave what behind? Unhappiness. -That was a bad answer. -No, it's true. It's not. Come hold me. What? Come hold me and you'll be happy. Right. And I'll find happiness in your arms. Yeah. In you. Yes. That's bullshit. I'm sorry, Sid, but you have to find happiness in yourself. No, that's wrong. People tell you that, but that's wrong. It's not. It is. I know people who have that-- that happiness from within, and that--that happiness, that's just them being pleased with themselves. -It's not enough. -No, you're being naive. I mean, you've just been stuck in this town, you don't know. I know that two people can meet each other and... like that, it's...it's like they've never been alone. -But that's not life. -Who says? That's...We never met before last night, but we know each other. I don't know you. You know me. No, I don't. Yes you do. No. I know you wanna fuck me. Is that what you know? 'Scuse me. I'm looking for my parents. My mother, my father, they used-- Oh. Hello. Hello. This is my house. I mean...this is the house I grew up in. Well, this is his house now. -All right, nice to meet you. -And he's deaf. -Nice to meet you! -He's stone deaf. -And yelling doesn't help? -No. Right. My name's Nick, Nick Brown. What's your name? Elizabeth. No. Yes. I know an Elizabeth. Call her Beth. I'd like to stay right here. I have to be out tomorrow. In this moment. Enjoying this moment. Moment's gone. It can go on as long as we want. Have you ever been in a relationship? No. I was married, but, uh, it wasn't really a relationship. You weren't married. Yeah, two years right out of high school. Do I remind you of her? Oh, no. Oh, thank God. What happened? She disappeared. Was she ever found? Not by me. No, I didn't go look. She wanted to meet someone new and I asked her why. She said "Because he won't know me from before, just now. Just--just what I am now." But you can't escape who you are no matter what, all those years are there. She didn't understand that if you leave they're still there in you. But they stop being clear. You stop knowing who you are and what you want. You stayed here, you know who you are? I see the lawns I mow and the houses I've painted, friends I know, my parents. I'm constantly reminded who I am. You know what you want? I want you. Oh. I want to be inside you. Oh, good. Come here and put it inside me. No, I want to be able to put myself inside of you. Doing this is as close as you get. Come here. I love you. Come inside me. Beth? Yeah? What do you want? Come inside me. When did he move here? Do you know where the people before him went? -No. -You're sure? Yes, he doesn't remember anymore. So he can't help me. No. I lost my parents. Did you lose both of them at the same time? Is that a joke? No. Then, yes. I lost them both at the same time. I lost mine one at a time. Last year. I'm sorry. It's tragic. They were six months apart. Body failures, separate body failures. I'm--I'm really sorry. Well. Thanks for the sandwich, it was delicious. First--first, my father's heart kept stopping and starting. Attacks? Yeah. My mother and I would go to visit him in the hospital and--and he'd grab at us. He'd just grab our arms and hold on. That's really--that's very sad. But I gotta be going. Right before my mother died she said to me, "Elizabeth, you're adopted." Did you find your real parents? No. Two are enough to lose. I'm not alone, I have my grandfather. Listen... ...I have to go. I'm sorry. He's stone deaf. I have to go. What's wrong? I'm happy. No. No, no, you see, you have to be able to help me. This is not a prank. This--this is my home phone. This is an emergency. Yes it can, yes it can, it can be done. Someone there can hook the phone back up. It's not like a phone guy came to our house to disconnect the phone. Nobody came to our house. Someone just flipped a switch somewhere. Somewhere there, where you work. Or plug--plugged something into a computer and the phone stopped working. They turned it off, they can turn it back on. I know. I know it's the weekend. I know, call them at home. They'll have a computer at their house. They'll--they'll have a phone thing to hook up into the real computer. That's how these people live! They'll be glad to do it. I can't have the police go to my house. That won't work. No, it's you, Janet, you have to be able to help me. I gotta phone home, I can't wait, it could be too late. Janet, please. You got--you gotta help me. Please, you can reconnect me. Janet, don't hang up! Don't hang up! You fucker! You heartless fucker! Good morning. Hi. Hi. I, um, didn't want to wake you. Oh, I'm awake, I'm a morning person. Oh. I'm not. Why don't you come back to bed? I can't. Gotta pack. Where do we start? No, no, you paint. Okay. Oh, God. The phone work? No. How was he? Young. A little weak on tenderness but long on juice? Long on conversation. Mm. Did you need talk? I guess I did. Good. What are we doing? Beth. I don't know. Shit. I mean, I was in Flagstaff for two years before you guys got here. I mean, I've been here for five years. Yeah. This state's driving me crazy. What are you gonna do? Well, I got no money. I've got some. I can't take it, I mean, you're being great but I--I... I'm gonna be gone, we won't see each other again and I won't send it. I won't, I'll forget or I'll just never get around to it or just--I don't know. Just...shit. I--I'm just gonna sell all this shit, but I don't want any of it. Just my car and my clothes. Okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, just I shouldn't have fucked this kid last night, you know. I just--I should've slept. Now I've got all this stuff to do today and I'm tired and I'm all churned up, I'm in a fucking mood. Let's do things, let's get you busy. Okay. Uh. You get all the stuff that you want to sell and, uh, I'll make some yard sale signs. No one's gonna buy my shit. It's all junk. That's what people buy at yard sales. Hi, is there something specific you’re looking for? Yes. Actually, everything, I don't have anything. Nothing? I just moved to town. My husband passed away and I didn’t want to have our things. They were too familiar. You can have everything. For? Three hundred dollars, all of this stuff. Everything, um, stuff in the boxes and there's a few more chairs inside the house and a table and a mattress and a couch but it's a sofa bed. It folds out, it's very comfortable. Oh, my, I don't know. Everything? Yeah, everything. Except the TV, the TV's not for sale. Maybe some nice turquoise jewelry? I don't think she really wears jewelry. How about a nice Diné rug? What, as a present? No. What about that? That will make her laugh. That's authentic, it's very expensive. You got something like that but fake? I'm sorry, what's your name? Oh, um, could you just leave the name part blank? I won't have an account and I'll have to find a place to cash it for me. You're all loaded up and ready to roll. You did all the work. Oh, we're a full service outfit. I'd come and help you unload it except I've got to finish painting. But, uh, my lovely assistant, Carol, here would be happy to help. -Wouldn't you? -Sure, sure, I'll follow you in my car. And I'll come by tomorrow with my truck and the sofa bed. Oh, don't forget these. Oh, yeah, of course, thanks. Thanks a lot. Oh, thank you, you've given me a home. I'll be right along. That had to be history's most efficient yard sale. I know. It's true. I'm sorry that Sid stuck you with the unloading. Oh, that. No problem. He kind of bites my butt. But he's okay. Yeah, he is. Oh, well, listen, I'm probably gonna be gone before you get back. You know, I was thinking that, uh, maybe we could be roomies, you know? Roomies. Just until you figure out what's next. Hm, hm. Uh-uh-uh, I can't, I can't. Why not? 'Cause if I don't go now I'll just wind up staying with him and he just--he gets to me too much, you know. I can't. You've done worse. We both have. Mhm. Sid? Hi. I'm sorry about the sofa bed. Oh, it's all right. I didn't really need one. When my friends get drunk they just throw up and sleep on the floor. But I gave it to you. Well, you--you gave me a lot more. It's all even in this department. Feel me. Yeah. You're hard again. I want you. All the time. Oh, shit. Mm. I just fleeced a widow. No, you didn't. Yeah, I did, it was all junk. I gotta go, take a couple of aspirin. Funny, I didn't think I had enough to drink that I would have a hangover. You just feel bad for her like I feel bad for her, 'cause her husband died. Yeah? Yeah. That's about the saddest thing there is. Losing someone you love. It's never happened to me. If you died... I couldn't stand life. I have to go now. New people are gonna be here. -Go to my house. -No. Just while you're looking for a place. No, I gotta go. Really, there's a friend of mine, I know she's got a place in Agawam. No. Agawam? No. No, I don't know where I'm gonna go, just somewhere else. Well, you--you can call me when you get there. I'll give you my number. Sid. I'm going away, you're making me way too important. You just met me yesterday. And today I love you. Oh, Jesus, one day. That's not important, it doesn’t matter if it's a day or a year. It can happen in a second. No, that's a fucking animal thing, I've done that. I meet men, I go home with them,and I just stay. There's no decision involved, it's just like-- it's just what I do. That way I don't have to lead my life, I can just lead theirs. I can't keep doing that. -We're not that way. -What way are we? We're passionate, we're comfortable, we're-- It's been passionate, it's been comfortable. But it hasn't been important like you're making it. It is important, you know that. It was a night, it was fun, it was some great fucking but it's just something that happened. It's not just something that happened, we're it. I'm the one for you. -The one? -Yeah. I'm twenty-fucking-eight years old, I've had lots of ones. -You're just the latest. -No. I'm the last, you found me and it can go on forever. Oh, oh, Sid. Forever. You've gotta understand it's just talk. It's not. It is, it is! I mean, come on, these things you say? Come on, what, that if I died you couldn't stand life, that's--that's--that's-- -What? That's true.-No, you won't know when I die. You won't be there. You'd want me there. If I wasn't there it wouldn’t matter who was, you'd be alone. No. Beth? -Beth, you love me. -No. How--how do you feel? Think. You love me. I care about you. You have to be with me. No, I care about you but I'm an adult, I can say no. That's what makes you an adult? Yes, I can say no. No, I won't do that. No, I won’t have that. No, I can't. You can say no to me? Yes. I'm going. Beth. Have some place to go. I don't. -Why don't you-- -Don't tell me what to do. -What are you gonna do? -I don't know. Beth! Beth? She's not here. Shit. Excuse me. Shit. Who are you? Painter. You're Nick. Yeah. The Indian Chief. Shit. You're too late. She's gone. I got that, where'd she go? She didn't say. Shit! This really bothers me. Do me a favor? What? Act normal. This is my house. You're in my house and I'm tired of there being strangers in my house. This is not your house, you're gone. I'm painting for the new people whose house this is going to be. You're gone, they're not here yet, I'm here. Well, I guess that makes this my house. Mind if I look around? Sure, make yourself at home. Aw. No. She left the TV. Yup, she didn't seem to want it. You're back. Yeah. Is Beth here? No, you know where she went? No. Shit. -You're too late. -She's gone. Who is this guy? Beth's new boyfriend. What? Is this true? Not really. Not really? Not really! What? Did you fuck her? I don't tell. Jesus. The next day. Well, that's the world, huh? Won't even wait a day anymore. -You left her. -Yeah, I didn't fuck anyone. You didn't find anyone. No, I didn't leave her for another person, I left her for another place. Which I think is a little more excusable! I don't! Well, this is none of your fucking business. -I think it is. -Why? 'Cause you fucked her? No, that gives you no business in my life. Leave him alone. -Why? -He was nice to Beth when you treated her like shit. No. No, she was vulnerable and he fucked her! I loved her. Yeah, right! -He was there for her. -And I wasn't? You were halfway to Butte! Yeah, but when I was here I was there for her. Nick, you were never really here. Is that what you think? I'm just telling you that they were good with each other. And I brought them together. It seems I'm blessed in what I do. I do wrong, it turns out right that I've done right, so it doesn't really matter what I do. No, no, because if you hadn't left I wouldn't have been with Beth. I'd be done painting, I'd be home. Oh, be glad you have a home, asshole. Nick! If you were such the happy couple why isn't she here? Because after three years with you she wanted to be alone. And why wouldn't you go be alone with her? It wasn't offered. People aren't gonna offer you anything. You gotta take what you want. Well, you can't take another person. They've got to give themselves to you. Oh, that's very wise. But not very true. I sell TVs, people don't know what they want. I have to show them. Well, I--I couldn't. That's too bad. 'Cause that's why she left. To maybe be closer to what she wants. And what is that? How the hell would I know? What do I know? What the fuck do I know! I know that what I want isn't out there! It isn't in here, it isn't inside, it isn't outside! It doesn't exist but he wants her! And he isn't doing shit about it! I--I--I can go after her. Yes, you can. Fuck. Oh, Sid, where are you gonna look? I don't know. -Congratulations. -Thank you. You've just fucked up another person's life. -No. -He's not gonna find her. -He might. -It's a big planet, asshole! Shit! -She'll head for her parents. -What? She'll head for her parents, they're in Florida. Take Route 10, keep going east. And around 11, start checking every roadside motel. The budget ones, if you do that you’ll find her. How do you know she's on the highway? When you don't know where you're going, you drive on the highway. I didn't finish painting. I'll finish. Nick? Yeah? What you've been doing you can’t do anymore. I understand. It's not that you can't do it. It's--it's that I don't want you to do it. Anymore. Okay. Nick. I've stopped. I went to my parents' house. Like you said to. And? There was this... ancient man. This giant man in the doorway... ...and I thought, "That's my father. My, how he's aged." He was very tall. He was too tall to be my father. And he was wearing a long, long robe and I thought... it's a trick, he's sitting on my mother's shoulders. And then out from behind him came this beautiful, young girl. Beth. Yeah, Beth. And... ...they sang to me. London bridge is falling down Falling down, falling down London bridge is falling down, my fair lady It was very touching. I'm sure. It was. It was very touching. Shit. I hate talking to you.
