Family Counsel - Shall we play cops? - If you want. - What a mess. - And people even watching. - So shall we play? - Yes. Come on, guys. He can't be a cop. His father isn't French. Burion... you neither. Your father was convicted. - "Louis and Max Faucon..." - It's not true. "sentenced to 7 and 5 years for theft." Mom! Mom! Dad is not in hospital, you know. A pupil told me he's not in hospital... Not in hospital, sweetheart. In a sanatorium. Sorry. But no. They showed me... Was your outdoor class nice? Here is your snack. What is it? Dad is in jail, and Faucon as well. I saw it in the newspaper. Dad is no longer in hospital? Can we see him? The doctor refuses. He has sores. - Faucon as well? - Yes. I was 13. I couldn't imagine my mother to be lying. She seemed embarrassed. She didn't want to tarnish the image of dad. What did dad do? Dad has a job like everyone else. A bit like an acrobat, without spectators or net. Prison is an occupational accident. As in Monopoly. One bad move and you end up in prison. But what exactly was he doing? I'll tell you when I get back. It won't be long. Not a word to your sister. Not a word about what? When I found out about dad, I was in the spotlight. That was exciting. What is this? No one dared to fight me. The little kids even said I was the son of a professional killer. Look how he's dressed! You wanted him to arrive in a striped suit? You're hurting me. But... he has no sores. You look beautiful. You got heavy. I was captain of the handball team. - They had a game tonight. - It's stupid. He's for the brooms team. - It doesn't matter what they say. - That's funny. It's really funny. You're even more beautiful than in the visitors room. The children. It's really changed here. It's big. You, come closer. You look like quite a guy. François is first in his class. Have a good look at your father. He just did 5 years without bending his knees. Quite a man, your dad. Your wife is exceptional. Many find the desert coming home. Show us that you haven't lost your touch. This champagne isn't cold. There's nothing worse than warm champagne. Just kidding, Marianne. You just forgot. Shall we drink to my team? It will please them. - To the coat racks. - To the coat racks. So you were making coat racks? I was in accounting. - But you were still captain? - Yeah. It's not bad, this champagne. Even lukewarm. Just a bit. Lots and lots. Poor Martine, nobody cares for her. Why couldn't he bend his knees? - Why are you laughing? - Go get Dad's surprise. You coming? Hurry up! Come, put it on the table. - That's nice. - An idea of François. Come on, Dad. You have to blow. Five years. They are gone up in smoke. I'll going to get work, to avoid past mistakes. There's vacancies at National Insurance. Door-to-door. You have the honor to cut the cake, and I'll make a photo. Come on, François. Come here. The memory of that day stops there. What remains is the photo taken by Faucon. Mom told me that Faucon didn't have anyone, except for a Polish aunt and us. I was counting on him to introduce me into the mysteries of Dad's profession, but Faucon wouldn't say anything. Hey, a black cat. There. There. - Will you give me an autograph? - What does he want? Who do you think we are? - François can start today. - Just as I wish. Mom was against changing schools. She read Le Nouvel Observateur and didn't trust the clergy. She associated the clergy with homosexuality. God knows why. I want him to do the catechism. On Sunday I'll take him to church myself. They imposed a gag order on me. I became once more an ordinary schoolboy without prestige. So we have basketball, judo, handball and a swimming pool. Handball? We must do our utmost. And shooting too? We have no shooting range, but you'll find it's easy. No more cuddling. This is the last warning. Tomorrow you’ll get a haircut. You're hurting him. I already asked him ten times. - All the boys are like that. - I don't care about the others. He's cute with his long hair. - Then I'll grow a beard. - Like a cop. You'll see what the constable does to the police women. - The door. - It is closed. - What are you looking at? - Don't push me. - They make love. - What? For sure. You see? They no longer fit. - We're broke right now. - What are you doing? Like that, it's ready, darling. It's disgusting. - I want some. - Me too. This is not for kids. For the nerves. No. First that one. For the jitters. He's still there. This is the 3rd time. They're watching us already? No. That's not what this is about. Take 30 Franc and get a haircut. A real delinquent. You're quite the guy! - What are you doing? - An exercise for the nerves. Of constraint. I then understood that they were preparing for a job. It was executed in the utmost secrecy. I already guessed by certain benefits, in the form of purchases for us all, and a better mood for Dad. - Shall we take a vacation? - If you want. You dance, madam? - I'm thirsty. - Me too. We made reservations this morning. - I'm hungry. - A jug of water. - We wait for Faucon. - Why? Because. All set. - You want water or wine? - Wine. This is the last big meal. Tomorrow we're working out. You pass me the bread and butter? A house at the seaside would be nice. - Yes, in the south. - Good idea. - You can work anywhere. - Or a sailboat. Right, Max? We could travel around the world. - I won't go on a boat. - Then you go to boarding school. Okay then. Eat, instead of watching others eat. - He's watching the girl. - A girl? - What girl? - That one over there. - Do you know her? - No. But I've seen her. There are certain persons that you feel you already know. - It's a mystery. - It's reincarnation. We infinitely meet the same people... under different circumstances from one life to the next. That's all. ♪ My captain told me ♪ ♪ "Where you going without worries?" I'm go to my valley ♪ ♪ To join my regiment...♪ - Nice song. ♪ They advised me to take my leave ♪ ♪ For my own good ♪ Who are these idiots? What is this? Don't get upset. We're going to be in trouble. Shit. It's disgusting. It smells like shit. - What about going to the police? - That's really funny. Go and connect the water. They did the same to you? They pulled this on me before. Go to the police. They are just kids. I have one. I know what it is. Little bastards. File a complaint. What an idiot! A squirt of water and it's gone. Do you like to be covered in shit? - We'll go to the police. - Are you crazy? Say that I sent you. Henri Chauvault. - Nice to meet you. - Thank you. Who is this motherfucker? We have to change houses. - Why? - Because. Come in, François. I can't sleep. It will open like a can of tuna. In the country they conserve. What's this? We're working. You can stay, but don't disturb. Here is an outdated radar. We will pass through the main entrance. Max... For the nerves. Here. Burn all of this, François. - Everything? - Yes. They're no good. And the envelope. - I'll go in with the endoscope. - We have to make a hole. Your problem is style. You can come in, Martine. No one is sleeping here. What were you saying? Your problem is your style. Your style is your enemy. Be a little clearer. I understand what she means. Explain it to us fools. Your style betrays you. It leaves your footprints. You have too much personality, darling. What do you think we should do? Change your style each time. That way the police won't spot us by our habits. That's fine. I've never talked about habits. To me, you're an artist. You can't say that an artist's art has habits. No. Art has no habits. It has a style. Little prick. Okay, okay. Get the hell out! Come on, guys! Let me go! Let me go. I'm coming with you. - What were you doing? - Where are you from? - Who sent you? - Dirty Parisian. - Nasty twit. - Little shit. Who is the leader? There is no leader. There's always one. What do you want the leader for? See, there is a leader. - I want to come with you. - You're not! Twit. Let's beat him up. - He'll turn us in. - That's not true. My father is in jail for robbery. He's doing 10 years. Do you have a bike? - Mopeds makes you weak. Hunchback. - And stupid. Look at them. Look at that gang of losers, sprawled like toads. You want to be like that? Where are you going? Come on! I'll be back. You play with Mark? - I'm late. - That's fine. Look. The little bastard. Take a right. You must help me disguise it. Thief! When I think of the money we pay to the club... Look at your son. Is that how you raised him? I kill myself to give you a holiday. Isn't a bike enough? I should hand you over to the cops, so you'll find out about stale bread. With your intelligence your mother is always harping on, you didn't think that you risked attracting the police here? What do we do now? François will bring the moped back. Max will follow by car and bring him back. He'll go to bed without dinner. And no television all week. There is no TV here. Here. - With butter and cheese. Is that okay? - I'm not hungry. Does it still hurt? - No. It's fine. - Dad is nervous. He still has the papers of the solicitor, so you understand... - What solicitor? - The job was a solicitor. - Did they do it? No kidding? - Three days ago. How do you know? Eavesdropping. The safe was really a can of tuna. - What does that mean? - A tin can. They found money and papers. Faucon said that once in the hands of a specialist, the papers will allow fruitful entanglements. Where are the papers? Buried between the firs in the garden. You want to see? - No! Did they find a lot of money? - It's the deal of a lifetime. We had to pay a large share to Faucon's informer. But there's a lot left. Mom will have her cello. It's a surprise. And for Dad and Faucon? I nicked something too. You want to see? Open it. It's yours, if you want. A Walkman. There's no headphones, but we can get some. - You'll get caught. - But no. Even dad and Faucon, the best, got caught. If the cops come, we'll all be in prison. And there'll be no one to bring parcels to the others. Hide it. We should stay on the right path. We must be better than the other children. What's the fun of stealing anyway? It's fun. Tell me more. It's not nice to have secrets, especially for Mom. - That I'm stealing? - That you know about dad and Faucon. That? You think so? If you want. That makes me feel good. - What's going on, my God? - Calm down. We have something important to tell you. Martine knows everything. Everything what? Everything. About you, Faucon, the job and even the papers of the solicitor. Fetch Faucon. How is this possible? Martine has been eavesdropping. You must go to daddy. Martine knows everything. Well, I gotta say... Don't worry about that. You're stupid to wake people like that. Go make coffee. - You're okay? Did you talk to Mom? - Yes. She told Dad. Are you happy? No more secrets in the family. Are you happy? Yes. It's fine. You look awful. - Your father wants to talk to you. - There? Right now? Again and again! We worked on Martine. - Tell her about the orphanage. - They get whipped and there are rats. - Soup for dinner. - And in the morning. They sleep on the floor. - Toothless old women keep watch. - And kiss you. - Did you read David Copperfield? - Oliver Twist. Oh well... You will have to make her read it. No. Rather, you read it to her. You should scare her. She'll believe you more than us. Agreed? You understand? Good. Okay. Here. Your corn flakes. They are too soft now. - Will you read me David Copperfield? - Oliver Twist. They said David Copperfield. This is all too complicated. Just swear before God. You understand? - I swear. - No. First you must pray. With a prayer, you'll be protected from the orphanage. Like you've got polio. I am vaccinated for polio. Prayer is a bit like a vaccine. - You must swear on the Virgin. - I swear on the Virgin. Not like that. And not here. We're in pajama. Faucon is naked. We'll have a big ceremony and we buy you a dress. - Can I invite a friend? - Of course! I don't think so. Wow! It's pretty. We can start now. First you must pray. There. Put your hand there. "I swear on the Virgin to keep the secrets of my family." "I swear on the Virgin to keep the secrets of my family." - "In my heart." - "In my heart." "I take it upon me to pray for the good of my family, "with double passion for the jobs." - Repeat. - "I take it upon me to pray. "for the good of my family and myself. "With special intention..." "With special intention and double... "Passion." - "passion... " - "for the jobs." - " for the jobs." That's it. Very good. Sit down. Waiter... My sister took her role very seriously. We can't prove that we owe the success of this period... to the prayers and my sister's innocence. But who knows? Wow! The 103 SP. Can I have some? I understand it's your favorite brand. An idea of Faucon. And it's loaded, right? There is the warranty certificate. The original is at home. I heard the gang was arrested for raping 2 Dutch girls of 12. I wondered what I would have done. I would maybe have felt obliged to do like them. Dad was right to avoid gangs. Hello. Your tan holds well. For me, only a week in Paris. They like to exercise. You need a job that leaves free time. They go door-to-door. But of course, they have to be in shape. Do you think that the neighbor is spying on us? But no. She's just curious. You forgot your coal pellet. Shit. I can still take it. Not too much. I've drunk enough liquid for today. What do liquids do? They make you piss. On a job it's a handicap. It distracts. Some are pissing on the job, against chairs, on the beds. They believe it brings good luck. It's not our style. - Imagine having the shits on a job. - Max! Not at the table. Some guy points a gun at you. - Before, during or after? - During. Are you worried? A bit. Go see Martine. Go see if she sleeps. I put a small sleeping pill in her milk. You're not sleeping? I did a big prayer for the job. You didn't drink your milk? They've added syrup to sleep. How is it up there? - Will you tell me what they're doing? - Tomorrow. Sleep. - I'd rather you do that in the kitchen. - Get off my back! Excuse me, Marianne. You know what it's doing to me. Great artists have the jitters. The more stage fright, the better they are. You tremble, carcass. Look. I had my Gelsium. I avoid drugs, even homeopathic. I want to rely on my own resources. - What are you afraid of? - I don't know. Going back to jail? Not a chance. The jobs are carefully prepared. In that case I can go with you. I want to go with you. Are you out of your mind? Go do your homework. Tell me: If you're scared, why are you doing this job? It's a great profession. - This evening, you take me. - Look at that. Want to be beaten? Otherwise, I might tell. You're not in bed yet? Might tell? I could be careless in class. - He doesn't know what he's saying. - Oh yes. I'll tell the cops. I can't take it anymore. You know what it's called, what you're doing? Blackmail. - You know what the cops will do? - They'll send me to boarding school. My little boy is tired. Boarding school, child protection, I don't care. We can't work like this. We can handle the years in prison. But child protection... Stop with this David Copperfield. With you I risk nothing. Do I look like a guy to give in? This kid is vile. You knew he was this vile? Take the phone. - Tell the cops, little snitch. - When you are on the job. But you'll take me. We will lock you up in a closet. We should whack him. What do you think? It would be over quick. We dump you in the Seine. And say that you ran away. What am I saying? It was a joke. To scare him. Look what you did to your godfather. What do you want to do on a job? There is nothing there. It is stupid, plain stupid. Then you have an stupid profession. He'll rat us out. He's capable. We'll give up. We'll get back to door-to-door. Go up and down 20 flats. 5 floors per building. 100 floors a day! Higher than the Eiffel Tower. It's not possible to have kids in this business. I was right. Let's drop it. Tomorrow we'll do the Eiffel Tower again. You can't pay for his school, and he'll go to the factory! The school and priests annoy me. I'll go to the factory, and you to jail. I'll tell them about the solicitor. My God, what have I done? We can't give up. We worked on it for months. Take him. It's only normal that he wants to see. You're right. We can't have normal children. We must accept what happens tonight. But I know my son. François will never rat on you. That's where you're wrong, mom. And if you tell on them, I'll kill you myself. Go get dressed. Your Gelsium. There you are, 13, on your way to a criminal adventure. - Can I drink from the Thermos? - No. That's for after. It's getting wet. - Look at that moron with his headlights. - Relax, Louis. - Wait for me. - I'm scared. I want to come with you. - You can wait for 5 minutes. - No. Shh. You're a pain. Here. Look. - There are dogs. - They smelled us. We need a.22 with a silencer. That's not our style. Look. It works. Get up. Don't be scared. Come here. Give me your foot. - What is it? - Tiger shit. It scares the dogs. They won't touch you. It's a gypsy trick. I'd say that these assholes surely never saw a tiger. What did you throw at them? Meat with sleeping pills. It will make them sleep a few hours. - It smells like bergamot. - It smells like what? What is it? It's us, dummy. - Anybody here? - No. The owner is at the Enghien casino. Does she live alone? With her maid and driver, who'll return at 3 am. - And the maid? - Be careful. - What about the maid? - She should be sleeping. - Joseph gave her a sleeping pill. - To her as well? - Why did Joseph do this? - For the money. Here's the job. Will it work? I'll check on the maid. It is hot here. These are Joseph's clothes. - It smells bad in here. - It smells old. - And if she were found dead? - That's another criminal offense. - What if we get caught? - You'll bring us bad luck. I don't know how long it takes. Here. Take this. * I'll be in the garden. Fucking heat. Bring me a glass of water. Put on gloves. Is anything happening yet? Don't you want tea? The tea is for later. Are you sure there's something in the safe? You irritate me. I didn't do anything. Your presence irritates me. I wish I'd sent you to boarding school. Sit down. Look at the pictures. - * Where are you? It's 2:10. - It's 2:10. - Shit! - Okay. I got it. And if you can't open it? Get the fuck out. Disappear. Did a safe withstand ever before? * Never. But I wouldn't be surprised tonight. Why do I irritate you guys? I'm interested in what you are doing. Why do I irritate you? Wow! God, where have you been? Look. It's hot. It's great. See? This is the best moment. Next comes business. Warn Faucon. We're going. Faucon, that's it. Let's go. What are you doing? This is for Mom. Leave it where you found it. We are professionals. Not pilferers. - You smell like cognac. - Wild strawberry. You know... It was... It was great. Come. A good onion soup. It's hot. I don't want to go to school. In our business, we don't change our habits. You wanted it yourself. You're not hungry? Then go to bed. You'll be our lucky charm. We'll take you always. Did you see them? How was it? I even touched them. They were hot. I'm cold. - Will you tell me? - Yes, yes. No. Don't switch channels. Here. Wow! Great! It's nice, eh? What are you doing here? Don't touch my things. You don't get it at all. Super, the TV. Hello, darling. How was school? 17 for physics, 19 for French. (out of 20) 2 for music. - Beethoven was "deav". - Was what? Deafish. They say "deaf". Everyone knows that. - But you can't see anything. - Further on! Here. Come. - Not bad. - This is a nice area. The dolls are pretty. It's convenient, right? It's a good cover. Right? I like it. - So you buy it? - Of course. According to you, whom? Two choices. The shyster will cost a lot. And secondly, there isn't one. There's a 3rd possibility: my brothers. What are you looking at? When I was little, my father went hunting here. - Did he take you? - A few times. If I ask him, will he also take me? But he was killed in the war. In the war with the Germans? No. The war in Algeria. - Were you all alone? - No. My brother Octave was there. - Was he nice to you? - You can stop there. Was he nice? No. Octave wasn't nice. And your mom? It feels good to stop. What about Faucon. How do we present him? He's your partner, right? Okay. That's a good idea. France is beautiful. Are you okay, Mom? Yes, honey. You see over there? - That's where I spent my childhood. - The castle there? Was that your home? That's mom's home. Too bad we don't have any tiger shit. - What did she say? - We talk about tigers. - There is somebody. - That's a nice horse. They ride like noodles. Scipio, Hannibal, foot! Lay down! Lay down. Long time. - Must be ten years, right? - Twelve. Nine. - My partner, Maximilian Faucon. - You're welcome. - You must be François. - Yes sir. These are your cousins. Anne-Marie, Marie-France, Odile, Elodie, Stephanie, Alexandra. Geoffroy, take care of your cousin François. Stephanie and Alexandra, go play with Martine. Let's go play. France, you haven't told me the reasons for your visit. Pleasure aside, of course. Do you need money? - Not exactly. - No, Octave. You want to talk now? After lunch. I just wanted to make sure. - Hello, miss France. - This is little Nicole. You've become a real lady. - Nicole is married and has a cute baby. - Of eight months. Nicole has agreed to look after grandfather. How is he? It's very complicated. Isn't that right, Nicole? Yes, a little. I've got to go. See you later. I want to see him. He no longer recognizes Nicole and Octave. He's not your grandfather but mine. He's 100 years old. He was a captain in marshal Joffre's army. - You know him? - He won the battle of the Marne. Here are the things of your mom. Mom hid them. Dad wanted to burn them. Martine, come and see. Even prettier. - This is my mom's, right? - Yes. This morning he refused the bottle. He threw it away. He's all dirty. I need to clean him up. He was never like that. I found him very nervous today. - He recognized you with binoculars. - He told you about me? He no longer speaks since you left. He doesn't hear. Finally, at least he doesn't want to hear. He's not bullying you? He's very gentle. And I have a lot of milk. Well, it does bother me a bit, but he's very gentle. Soldier of my country. Don't tell my mother. But rather tell him. That I'm in Bordeaux, prisoner of the English. And she'll never see me again. Gentlemen, let's go eat. Second floor, third window to the right. A safe, a real tuna can. And what about the alarm on the doors and windows? This is family. We need a minimum of ethics. - So François, do you like the house? - Yes sir. I impose you our habits. And we have the same. Bless us, Lord. Bless this meal and those who prepared it. Give bread to those who don't have any. Amen. And you, Martine? - You don't know how to pray? - It's not necessary. God knows my needs. Pointless to ask about them non-stop. That must be your mom's ideas. François, how's school? All right, sir. - He's the first in his class. - Geoffroy too. - Elodie? Odile? - First. - Stephanie? Alexandra? - First. And I'm almost the last. Cecilia and Julie are behind me. Let's talk about the fictitious loan. We need to purchase a business. We have money, but we can't justify its origin. Marianne thought that you would agree. There will be a fee. France should have talked to me on the phone. You would have avoided making such a long journey. And me having to deny you, in these conditions. Mathilde, please excuse us. Already? Marie-France! I never understood why my mother went to her brother. Maybe to let us know her past, about which she spoke so little. Perhaps driven by nostalgia to revisit the places of her childhood. The shyster is there. - Stop calling him that. - Let him. He's right. Nice motorcycle, uh. - Does he have lice? - No. It's not that, he IS a louse. Faucon had contacted the shyster. He made us a fictitious loan. He got 20% interest per year. - Hello, children. - Hello. - Are your parents here? - Yes. Great. - How are you? - Great. - You did all that? - Eh yes. It's wonderful. - You always liked it? - Yes. You know that we are neighbors? The palace is 5 minutes away. Allow me to invite you to lunch one day. We'll see. He's nice. - Have you seen it? - Yes. Do you like it? François, it's over here. By the way, Christine. An employee. Hello. This is the apartment. It's all yours. I'm your fictitious landlord, your fictitious lender. That makes for many fictitious transfers. Why don't we indeed join forces? I don't know your business, but a lawyer is like a grave. It's just a small business. All businesses need a lawyer. A friend who protects, gives advise. It can triple the benefits and security. Think about it. We have all the time. You'll feel great in this apartment. She had a black cat. Where did you find this jackal? Are you still wanting to innovate? Couldn't you find some old guy? - He must work for the police. - He's too corrupt. - They wouldn't even want him. - Always your fancy talk. This quarrel leads to nothing. We have to be practical. The bastard didn't stop devouring you with eyes like a fried cod. He'll blackmail us. It's a sure thing. - We don't take the apartment. - Oh no! That's enough. It won't matter, with or without the apartment. - If your asshole, arrogant brother... - That chapter is closed. If he's an arrogant asshole, why must we ride horseback like them? I don't want a horse anymore. It's silly and pretentious. The new apartment didn't bring the expected happiness. I think the comfort and big money needs... had made us too febrile to prepare for any jobs. We were on a job near Amiens. The house of a magistrate, former President of the Court of Cassation. A nightmare of respectability. But there was jewelry... that we needed and probably gold. Stay there. I need an hour and a half. Get me a glass of water. What the hell did you do? My pliers. Quick. - We have a water problem. - What kind of problem? Towels! Towels! More. What a mess! - Shit. - Do you want me to help you? Leave me the hell alone. What are you doing? Shit. The endoscope is wet. Here François, clean it. Pull over to a phone booth and call the water company. This is all we found. We thought of you. François won't go on jobs anymore. We won't capitulate for bad luck. François is part of the team. It's for him to decide. Got them. Collect everything. We're going. Who's there? Who's there? Somebody there? Somebody there? Catch the thief! My revolver. My safe. Help. My safe. There. Hold the thief! Hold the thief! You okay? You have nothing? - Was there someone? - Yes. Take it easy. The motherfuckers. Lie down on the floor. Quick! Oh dear. Oh shit. They really got us! - I'll go pee. - Me too. - On the car. - You can piss over it. It was a nice bunch of diamonds. After buying another car, the debts of the unlucky jobs... and 4 months of pay to the shyster, there was almost nothing left. But the shop was doing really well. - What wood is it? - Cherry. Max, you want some tea? - The crooked lawyer is there. - 1 sugar or 2? - No sugar. - No sugar? That's bitter. Are your parents here? How are you? Dad's new nightmare was called Monique. Faucon was in love. No. I'm wrong, Monique was much later. - With a little sugar? - No. You know better. Back then, I had to be 16 or 17 years. Are your parents there? Hello. Faucon didn't want to work anymore... and was enjoying being engaged. Monique was a widow... and she was overwhelmed by Faucon. Nothing surprised me anymore. The lawyer was still there. He still took excessive fees for the money he never lent us.... and rent for the apartment we had bought. Do you realize she skidded for 50 meters? Yes. She got time enough to review her life. And flop against a wall. Still it's terrible. Here. You forgot your Gelsium again. - During the slide... - You told me 3 times already. But I've been dreaming about it for 4 years. It's great that it happened the day before the job. - If dad saw you... - Yes. How does it feel? Were you snooping again? Get a move on! How does it feel, to see naked women? I'll tell you when I get back. In 3 or 4 days. I won't be here. Shit. That's true. I'm tired of boarding school. All these idiots. And the nuns are worse. Get out. I told you how. Get out. If you want money, you know where I hide it. I prefer that one. For 3 years and 4 months he took about 27% of our gross income. Did you see? Le Parisien writes about it. "A lawyer of the Bar of Paris... "and his companion are killed under terrible circumstances." - And the cat escaped. - Yes it did. It was in the lady's jacket, well bundled up. She fell. She skidded for 50 meter. He wanted to overtake a truck that was going slowly. He flipped over. The idiot impaled himself. That's typical. You sure know a lot. That leaves us 27% more. Tonight it could be huge. Touch wood. We're going to be quiet for a long time. I'm thinking about leaving with Monique. Have you seen her again? No, no. I don't know where she went. With all the preparations for the job... But when we get back... Faucon would not see her again. Papa had sent her an anonymous letter... with a photocopy of Faucon's criminal record. Order was restored in the family. It's clever. The newly rich. Go tell Louis that all is fine and go watch your side. The other way. Fine. We got it all. 5, 1. 4. 2 left. 1, 5. It works. - Shit! - Shh. It is empty. There's only this. It's a Cézanne. Matisse. Braque. How are you? Do you live here? Speaking a foreign language. You speak English? ¿Se habla español? Don't make any sudden moves. Open the walkie-talkie. Sprechen Sie Deutsch? Me neither. You speak Latin? He speaks Latin. They speak Latin. Latin. They were two Bulgarian latinists who had defected... with their dad who was a chess champion and philatelist. The Dad and the shipowner, our host, had not gone hunting. They can return at any time. Where were they? Why didn't you see them? They were tasting wine in the cellar. Tell them to stop or we'll kill them. Who are they? Bulgarians. It's a cat. Here they are. They are here. - Where are they? - Come. Matisse, Renoir, Dubuffet, Braque, Dufy, Cézanne. You shouldn't drink. It makes your eyes puff. Finally someone is looking at me. Finally someone who dares speak to me about my sailor's wife's alcoholism. It has been going on for too long. Already before. All those nights being alone all the time. Nothing. I can't leave, I can't stay. I can't breathe. So I prefer to float. With or without alcohol, I've always been floating. Anyway, you see me as a partner. I'm transparent. And you, you looked at me. So I promise you, François, from tomorrow on, I won't drink. If this is to be forgiven, it's pathetic and futile. - What do you want us to do? - But, my poor darling, there's enough to fill a small museum. - We know nothing about paintings. - Change. You're not going to remain small locksmiths... all your life who eat their soup, with their little endoscope, chainsaws, umbrellas, acoustic waterspouts. Change. I understand nothing about paintings. And you? Learn. Search. Open books. Go to college, to school. And then what? What "school"? - The school of Le Louvre. - Obviously. It's the cops. - It's not. - It's 3am. Is it the milkman? Don't stay dressed. We should undress. - Throw it out the window. - What? - It's no use. - There'll be police in the courtyard. True. We should take the backstairs. Where to? To the roof. You think they are stupid? My! Shh. - They would have rung twice. - It's their new way. - Okay. I will open up. - No! No. Who's there? I see nothing. - What is she doing here? - My little girl. What happened to you? Get in. - What happened to you? - Call a doctor. - A doctor? - Yes. No. I don't want a doctor. - How did you get here. - I ran away from boarding school. But why? I was hurt. They pinched me. - Who pinched you, dammit? - Let's take her to her room. To her room. Don't you worry anymore. You're home. - You're dirty. - I'll heat some milk. Here. The milk. I walked and walked. I didn't want to stay there. Who did that? At school? - You came from Pontoise on foot? - A truck driver gave me a ride. A trucker? I'll kill myself if you send me back to boarding school. My kitten, you shouldn't. What for? Let me handle it. Go. That's it. They're all asleep. So? - How did you get all those bruises? - Like this. - You came hitchhiking? - No. By taxi. Give me a child. That's not possible. Please. They don't accept pregnant girls in boarding school. No. It's out of the question. Then stroke my back. I was no longer interested in busting safes. The temptation of the professional exploit was stronger than that of the spoils. Nothing happens. - Press. - Shit. The slightest movement in the room triggers an alarm. Faucon was strong but lacked imagination. He thought, the bigger protection, the better. That locks the alarm system, which has a device that unlocks it. To unlock the locking system, we need a HBW3. Do what you want. I don't care. Since he bought this fake farmhouse where we spent our vacation, Dad lost the patience for work. He only thought about suntan and body-building. Good evening, gentlemen. What do you want? We used a gun to put the dogs asleep from a distance. The tiger shit, monitored by the police, became scarce. Greta? Gentlemen. But what do... I can assure the sensitive people: The ladies are out for 15-20 min, and wake up euphoric. Who was that, honey? Gentlemen... Where is my wife? Will you shoot? Stay calm. She's safe. You can turn it on. It's there. - Is there a safe? - I'll open it. Oh no. That's not what we're here for. - It will only take five minutes. - No. Come on, hop. So that one, that one and the other over there. There, there. And that one. You have a good sleep? Gentlemen, are you leaving already? We put in hardly 20 minutes. It finally felt like stealing. Before it was work. This was gangsterism. Our reputation soon began to cross borders, like they say. Well? What did they tell you? We talked about trade, friendship. Latin simplicity and American spirit. - Will you join the Organization? - It's difficult. - It's not a Jockey Club. - It's far more closed. We reviewed the situation, talked about François. They asked me about his character. I told them about how he started. It made them laugh. The episode with the Bulgarians. - And what if they were cops? - What? Undercover cops. Admit that it would be funny. You can discuss, but if you're talking bullshit... - It would be fun, that's all. - Still this pornographic jersey? Like a whore. - I told them about you, too. - Thank you very much. I told them about your loyalty, your dedication. - If these people ever... - Come on! You know how they got in touch. - They told you who they were? - No. It was implied. - Allusions, references... - They could have been cops. Okay. You're still at cops and robbers. This is is about a more important organization than the freemasonry... or the Vatican. In two hours we are there. This is an organization that keeps its word. - A bit of champagne? - Yes. Actually they weren't cops, but the Organization which was examining our activities. Don't they have a bit of a reputation as killers? Killers! Where did you get that? And drugs? I am against it. The Mafia controls it. - And controls the inevitable. - I am for that. - Don't you, Max? - Sure. Listen. We'll always be the same. I would like to be sure. Dad and Faucon were invited to New York. First class and a limousine on arrival. Good. I'm going in. It was the first vacation of our lives. It was amazing to realize... how two men with such overbearing presence... can be forgotten so quickly. It was like we came out of hypnosis. I'll take another. Do you dance? - I haven't finished eating. - You'll finish later. - Let's dance. - No. I can't dance. - I'll teach you. - No. I can't. Make an effort. You put your hand there. - Aren't you coming with me? - No. I'll wait. I'm not a costumer. I'm interested. - What can you do? - Nothing. - Is it a Louis XV? - Not really. Rather the Regency. You were close. You want to see a real Louis XV? Come have a look. Come on and see. Do you know why they were laughing? When I saw you, I said: "The new one". An apprentice just left. Will you have me? Down. They come here to learn. And after 4, 5, 6 years they start for themselves. You can't do anything? I know how to steal. Neutralize alarm systems and dogs, without killing them. Here, it won't do you much good. This is beech. It doesn't really smell. The tea is ready. This is Sophie. I'm Peter. I'm François or Frederick. The last to arrive does the shopping. I'll call the others. Girls first. - You want some tea? - No thanks. Now this is hot glue. You put it in the bain-marie. You have to be careful that it doesn't burn. You know with what it's made? With bullwhip, beef bone and rabbit skin. * Arriving from New York, flight Air France... - Not a word to your father today. - You want me to change my mind? No. But give me time to prepare him. It's them? How are you? You don't look so good. What's wrong with him? He can't bear summer in the South. Me neither. This is not the time to falter. We have some very important projects in the region. - Where are the bags? - Over there. At Kennedy, there's 1 km of corridors to get to the luggage. You'll see. We were greeted like royalty. There's no air conditioning here. Shit. - We want bouillabaisse. - We'll buy fish. It doesn't matter, mom. We booked by telex at Tétou. - He called you "mom". - I'll get the car. - It's much too light. - We need to change it. - Where are your bags? - Get in. We gave them to the black chauffeur. Too old really. - Even my gift? - You need matching luggage. - It's tight. - It's not like a limo. - What is "a limo"? - A limousine. We had one available. This one fitted inside. Imagine an international group, interested in... a small successful company, managed by senior men. And that's us? That's us. They know everything about us. Especially François' electronic exploits. - It smells good. - It's better than their McDonald. They think we're interested to join them. And how much will it cost us? Good question, son. It'll cost us nothing. Why? Is this a charitable organization? Of course not, Mom. Max, explain. Don't call me "mom". It's the most beautiful name in the world. - It makes me 20 years older. - You have to be young at all costs? Explain it to François. With the Organization... we'll multiply our turnover by 10. They take 40 to 50%. An increase of 500%. - They'll detach us a team... - Spies. Security specialists, to please mom. Max, I forbid you to call me "mom". The most important thing is you. Don Roberto will personally take care of you. Actually, I read in the newspaper that they stole... 2 billion worth of jewelry at Cap Ferrat. Annoying, when we slave at opening safes. Shut up, Martine. I'm the last one informed. - I don't see... - You don't see? This loser operated in my territory. - What territory? - Mine. He took my opportunity to practise my specialty. - These jewels were mine. - Calm down, Louis. - It is the royal family of Spain. - Who ripped off the joint? No insurance. I'll call New York. He doesn't know what to expect. You'll see to it over there. You must leave as soon as possible. The faster the better. I won't go to New York. No more jobs. I will work as a carpenter apprentice. I also decided to get married and have a child. Max, take care of the bill. It's been three days that he locked me up. Dad does not believe in what I want, nor that I'm in love. He didn't even ask who she was. I haven't seen Sophie for three days. Still on hunger strike? I'm not eating. I'm afraid he'll drug me. Come on, family council. They are really gangsters gone astray. They had cowardly chosen a specialty in their measure. Now with the Mafia, they can have a few kicks. But I was flabbergasted that they played pupil's parents. The organization's target is me. New York can't wait. But I want to convince you. I don't want to use force. I want to convince you as well. The closed shutters will not prevent me from leaving. Your dad is too cool with you. One needle prick and hop on the plane. An injection? Alarm in New York. Louis isn't using his power. - Stop with these horrors. - And if I say no? A father has a duty to act an unpleasant role for the good of his son. It's the best proof of love. - But he's an adult. - Shut up. This is a family council. If we can not talk... Talk about what? A law allowing to abandon your son at 18? Here I'm the law. If you'll send him drugged, you will be ridiculed. The Organization doesn't consider being ridicule. We were so well before. We were locksmiths. And now... Now we'll be criminals. The violence is already there. France, you are admirable. You watch over us. You are the glue of the family. If you interrupt us, you go to your room. Your affection blinds you. Where is the violence? Violence Louis, is to send him against his will. This is insane. He's not in his normal state. Look! - It's him who looks drugged. - Bewitched. I decide for him. This internship is a unique opportunity. In 2 years, you will acquire an unsuspected master's degree, a high level in electronics, knowledge in law, in applied chemistry, psychology. Even a course in metaphysics. Based on the autogenic Tibetan yoga training. Concentration, psychic powers, mantras, hypnosis... To a talented subject like you, it can blow the limits. You'll open a chest by whistling between your teeth. I am a modern man. I prefer to convince instead of using force. I only want your happiness. This internship will lead you to the top. - You should have gone in politics. - You are right. Thank God, your criminal records will get us somewhere safe. In two months they'll be blank, thanks to our friends. It's irrelevant. I understand your taste for woodworking. Cabinet making. A hobby like your mom's cello. She plays for fun. - She's not playing in a bar. - Thank you. No one will prevent you from making sawdust. You can buy ultramodern machines. And let the others slave. I don't want an outfit. I want to be front row, with real people. What do you know, asshole? I started 15 days ago. - Don't lock him up like a baby. - But that's what he is. Look at me, François. You'll go to the workshop in spite of everything? You'll obey your boss? Will this be your father, your new family? No. It won't go that far. Do you mind? Your son fell for a sect. The brain washing has started. You'll get nothing from him. - The address of the workshop of that bitch. - You'll have to be de-conditioned. I need it, hear! - I don't know it. - You do know it. This is all pointless. Take him to his room. He's not a bitch. In New York are clinics for de-conditioning. And great specialists. Faucon... Tell my father I'll go to New York. - What? - Tell dad I decided to go to New York. Good boy. You're a decisive man. You'll get far. I know what I'm saying. - No? - He just told me. Hello? The superintendent, please. That's it. He's going. He decided himself. I believe, as dad had taught me, that I tried to reach my goal by honorable means. All I had left were means without honor. Papa had taught me not to hesitate. Are you sad? Of course. - Hello, gentlemen. - Hello. - Does Mr. Burton lives here? - Yes. Gentlemen, you're making a mistake. We are on vacation. Was that you? These gentlemen are from the police. And you? I appreciate the joke, but we are innocent. We'll follow you. And the Mafia? They'll decide we're messed up and leave use alone. At the worst, they'll hear about New York. This absurdity may cast doubt with my son. Just when he prepares to go to a great school. Farewell, Brutus. - We'll be back for dinner. - So no need to get excited. You know, Mr. Inspector, we are a very close family. Subtitles by Subransu
