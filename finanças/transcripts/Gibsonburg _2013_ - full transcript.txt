THERE WERE ONLY FIVE OF THEM MINTED SECRETLY IN THE PHILADELPHIA MINT. AN ECCENTRIC MAN, NAMED SAMUEL BROWN, BOUGHT ALL FIVE OF THEM IN 1913 FOR $50,000. >> WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COINS? >> RUMOR HAS IT THAT TWENTY YEARS LATER, IN 1933, SAMUEL BROWN FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS DYING. HE TRAVELED AROUND THE COUNTRY, HANDING THEM OUT LIKE REGULAR NICKELS. HE GAVE THEM TO PEOPLE THAT TOUCHED HIS SOUL OR FOR SOME REASON HE DEEMED SPECIAL. THE ONLY THING HE'D SAY IS, "I'D HANG ONTO THAT ONE IF I WERE YOU." >> HMM. >> WELL, OVER THE YEARS, FOUR OF THE FIVE HAVE BEEN RECOVERED.

THIS WAS WHEN YOUR GREAT-GRANDFATHER AND HIS TWO BROTHERS OWNED THE BAKERY. WELL, ALL YOUR GREAT-GRANDFATHER AND HIS BROTHERS DID WAS SPEND A LITTLE TIME WITH THE MAN. THEY LISTENED TO HIM. AND THIS MAN GAVE THE THREE OF THEM AN OLD BOX OF COINS. HE PULLED OUT ONE COIN AND MADE A POINT TO SAY, "I'D HANG ONTO THAT ONE IF I WERE YOU." BACK THEN, THAT ONE COIN WAS WORTH A LOT OF MONEY. I THINK THIS WAS THE YEAR 1933, A FEW YEARS AFTER THE STOCK MARKET CRASHED. WELL, THESE THREE BROTHERS, WHO WERE THE BEST OF FRIENDS, AS WELL? WELL, THEY WERE TORN APART ONCE THEY GOT THE COIN. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES, ALL THREE BROTHERS WERE FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER. THE STRESS CAUSED ONE OF GRANDPA'S BROTHERS TO HAVE A HEART ATTACK. THE OTHER BROTHER WAS KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT. ONCE MONEY ENTERED THE PICTURE, EVERYTHING COLLAPSED LIKE A EVERYTHING COLLAPSED LIKE A CHEAP HOUSE OF CARDS. CHEAP HOUSE OF CARDS. >> RON, YOU NEVER TOLD ME ALL THIS. >> NEVER REALLY SAW THE POINT. IN FACT, TO BE HONEST, I NEVER REALLY BELIEVED IT. DAD'S DEMENTIA WAS PRETTY BAD AT THE TIME. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO, DAD?

IN TODAY'S SEMIFINAL MATCHUP, WE HAVE GIBSONBURG TAKING ON JACKSON CENTER. I'M TIM McMAHON. ALONGSIDE ME IS KENT MERCKER, AND CALL IT DAVID/GOLIATH, CINDERELLA STORY, SEABISCUIT -- WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT -- GIBSONBURG, 12-17 ON THE SEASON, THE FIRST TEAM WITH A LOSING RECORD TO REACH THE STATE SEMIFINALS. REALLY SHOULDN'T BE HERE. BUT THEY'RE TAKING ON THE UNDEFEATED JACKSON CENTER, A LEGEND IN THE STATE. AND, KENT, THEY HAVE QUITE A TOUGH TASK AHEAD OF THEM TODAY. >> WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT AMAZES ME IS JUST TO LOOK OUT ON THIS FIELD, NOT SEEING THEM ALL YEAR. I DON'T THINK DAVID WAS THAT SMALL. >> [ CHUCKLES ] >> I MEAN, A LOT OF THESE KIDS DON'T LOOK LIKE THEY'RE 135 POUNDS. BUT EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE TO ME IS THEY'VE GOT 6 WINS THIS YEAR IN THE STATE TOURNAMENT, WHICH MATCHES THEIR SEASON TOTAL UP TO THIS POINT. BUT, EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, IF THEY LOOK TO CONTINUE THAT, THEY GOT A TOUGH TASK AHEAD OF THEM TODAY. THEY GOT JOSH THOMPSON THROWING FOR JACKSON CENTER. THIS KID'S ALREADY COMMITTED TO OHIO STATE ON A SCHOLARSHIP. GOOD FASTBALL. THROWS IN THE UPPER 80s TO THE LOW 90s. I HOPE THEY BROUGHT THEIR SLINGSHOTS TODAY, 'CAUSE THEY'RE GONNA NEED THEM. >> MY NEPHEW KYLE PLAYS FOR JACKSON CENTER. I HOPE THEY LIGHT THAT GIBSONBURG TEAM UP! >> YEAH, THEY'RE DEFINITELY GONNA NEED IT -- PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK, TOO. THOMPSON, BY THE WAY, THE THIRD PITCHER GIBSONBURG HAS FACED WITH A DIVISION I SCHOLARSHIP. ALL RIGHT, THE FANS ARE READY. WE'RE READY. GIBSONBURG/JACKSON CENTER JUST ABOUT TO GET UNDER WAY. HERE WE ARE, IN THE TOP OF THE 5th INNING. IT'S A SCORELESS GAME RIGHT NOW, A PITCHING DUEL THUS FAR. ALEX BLACK ON THE MOUND FOR GIBSONBURG FACING THE OTHER PITCHER, JOSH THOMPSON, WHO CAN DO MORE THAN JUST THROW THE BALL, KENT. >> YEAH, THOMPSON'S DEFINITELY A DUAL THREAT. DEFINITELY NOT SOMEONE YOU WANT TO TAKE LIGHT. BLACK BETTER BE CAREFUL HERE. >> RUNNER ON FOR JACKSON CENTER. HERE'S THE WINDUP AND THE PITCH. BALL HIT TO LEFT CENTER, A NICE FLARE, NICE DOUBLE FOR THOMPSON. THAT'S GONNA BRING A RUNNER AROUND. MAKES THE SCORE 1-0, JACKSON CENTER. HERE WE ARE, IN THE BOTTOM OF THE 7th INNING. 1-0, JACKSON CENTER. GIBSONBURG AT THE PLATE, WITH 2 OUTS. JACKSON CENTER 1 OUT AWAY FROM THAT STATE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. >> ALL RIGHT, WHO'S UP? OH! OH! THIS GUY CAN'T PITCH OR HIT HIS WAY OUT OF A PAPER BAG! >> BUT THE GOLDEN BEARS THREATENING. MILLESON ON SECOND, KISER ON FIRST FOR GIBSONBURG, AND THE PITCHER, ALEX BLACK, UP TO BAT WITH A 3-1 COUNT. >> THAT PITCHER WILL STRIKE BLACK OUT FOR SURE. I'VE KNOWN ALEX BLACK SINCE HE WAS LITTLE, AND HE'S NO -- AAGGHHH! >> A LOT OF COMMOTION GOING ON THERE. HOPEFULLY, EVERYBODY'S ALL RIGHT. >> I HOPE THAT ONE HIT AN EMPTY SEAT. THAT BALL WAS HIT HARD. >> HE DID THAT ON PURPOSE! I'M FILING A POLICE REPORT! NO, NO, NO! I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. >> BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE COUNT'S NOW FULL, TIM, AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS BOTH RUNNERS ARE GOING TO BE GOING ON THE PITCH. SO, IF BLACK CAN FIND A GAP HERE SOMEWHERE, THAT RUN SHOULD EASILY SCORE FROM FIRST BASE. [ CROWD CHEERS ] >> LOOKS LIKE WE'RE ONE OUT FROM GOING HOME. >> YEAH. LET'S JUST WAIT AND SEE WHAT ALEX CAN DO. >> HERE WE ARE, BOTTOM OF THE 7th -- 2 OUTS, RUNNERS ON FIRST AND SECOND. BLACK UP TO BAT. GONNA STEP OUT. CHECK WITH HIS THIRD BASE COACH. A LITTLE BIT OF STRATEGY PERHAPS HERE, KENT. >> HE MIGHT BE TRYING TO FREEZE >> HE MIGHT BE TRYING TO FREEZE THE PITCHER A LITTLE BIT. THE PITCHER A LITTLE BIT. >> PLAY! >> ALL RIGHT, BLACK BACK UP TO THE PLATE. HERE'S THE WINDUP AND THE PITCH. A HIGH FASTBALL AND BLACK HITS IT A MILE HIGH, A POP-UP RIGHT OVER HIS HEAD. SHOULD END THE GAME. >> THAT'S A FAIR BALL. HE'S GOT TO BE RUNNING. HE'S HEADED BACK TO THE DUGOUT. >> YEAH, HE'S DISGUSTED, BUT THE BALL DROPS. IT'S A FAIR BALL. [ CROWD CHEERS ] AND THE THROW TO FIRST IS OVER THE FIRST BASEMAN'S HEAD. BLACK IS SAFE. ALL RUNNERS ARE SAFE, AND GIBSONBURG WINS THIS GAME. IT'S OVER. 2-1 THE FINAL -- UNLIKE ANYTHING I'VE EVER SEEN. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, KENT. >> I'VE SEEN A LOT OF BASEBALL GAMES. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS HERE. THIS HERE. >> HEY, GIBSONBURG? ANYONE WANT TO PLAY IN THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP? [ ALL CHEERING ] ALEX BLACK, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO CHEW YOU OUT OR GIVE YOU A HUG.

[ CHEERING CONTINUES ] [ CHEERING CONTINUES ] [ SIGHS ] WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE? REALLY? HOW DOES A TEAM LIKE US GET TO THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP? >> YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WE'RE PLAYING A LOT BETTER. BUT THERE'S BEEN A CRAZY FLUKE IN EVERY GAME WE WON. I MEAN, WYATT HAD NOT HIT A HOME RUN IN HIS WHOLE LIFE. AND HE HITS 2 HOME RUNS AGAINST THE BEST PITCHER IN THE STATE. COME ON! THEN, THE WEIRD BREAKS WE HAD? AGAINST VAN BUREN, KALIDA, AND EDGERTON? >> I KNOW. >> AND THEN, TODAY, IF BLACK WOULDN'T HAVE CONFUSED EVERYONE THE WAY HE THREW DOWN HIS BAT, THEY WOULD HAVE CAUGHT THE BALL, FOR SURE. I MEAN, JACKSON CENTER WAS ONE I MEAN, JACKSON CENTER WAS ONE EASY CATCH AWAY FROM BEATING US. EASY CATCH AWAY FROM BEATING US. WHAT'S WRONG, RASE? >> THESE KIDS -- THEY JUST NEVER GIVE UP. THEY REALLY BELIEVE WE CAN DO IT. DO YOU THINK WE'LL WIN ONE MORE TOMORROW? >> JUST LOOK AT ALL THE FIRST-YEAR COACHES LIKE YOU THAT HAVE WON STATE WITH A 6-17 REGULAR-SEASON RECORD. >> VERY FUNNY. >> [ LAUGHS ] HEY, I'M OUT OF HERE. I GOT TO GET SOME SLEEP. >> ALL RIGHT, COACH. GET A GOOD NIGHT'S REST. GET A GOOD NIGHT'S REST. SEE YOU TOMORROW. SEE YOU TOMORROW. >> WELCOME TO THE OHIO STATE BOYS HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL STATE-CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. AND WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TODAY HERE AT HUNTINGTON PARK. GIBSONBURG, 13-17 ON THE SEASON, FACING OFF AGAINST LANCASTER FISHER CATHOLIC, WITH A 30-1 RECORD. BUT BACK TO GIBSONBURG. THEY WERE RUN-RULED SEVEN TIMES AND WENT THROUGH A STRETCH THIS SEASON WHERE THEY LOST 12 GAMES IN A ROW. HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN, KENT? HOW DOES A TEAM LIKE THIS GET HERE? >> I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS THAT, INCLUDING GIBSONBURG. BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS. WE COULD BE WITNESSING HISTORY TODAY. IF GIBSONBURG DOES FIND A WAY TO WIN THIS GAME TODAY, THEY WILL BE THE ONLY TEAM, NOT JUST IN OHIO, BUT IN ANY STATE, WITH A LOSING RECORD TO WIN A STATE CHAMPIONSHIP. >> A REMARKABLE FEAT IF THEY CAN PULL THIS OFF. AND VERY SHORTLY WE'LL FIND OUT IF GIBSONBURG CAN REPLACE THAT IF GIBSONBURG CAN REPLACE THAT GLASS SLIPPER WITH A CROWN. GLASS SLIPPER WITH A CROWN. WELL, SO FAR, THE STATE-CHAMPIONSHIP GAME CERTAINLY LIVED UP TO THE HYPE. GIBSONBURG AND ALEX BLACK, RIDING THAT MOMENTUM FROM THE JACKSON CENTER GAME, GETTING OFF TO A HOT START TODAY. >> YEAH, AND YOU JUST HOPE BLACK CAN KEEP IT UP. HE PITCHED 7 INNINGS JUST A DAY AGO. SO, HE'S RUNNING ON FUMES, AND LET'S JUST SEE IF HE CAN LET'S JUST SEE IF HE CAN CONTINUE. CONTINUE. >> OH! KISER -- THAT HAS TO HURT. KISER -- THAT HAS TO HURT. >> SAFE! >> SAFE! >> FISHER CATHOLIC NOW HAS 5 RUNS AFTER THAT BASES-LOADED TRIPLE IN THE 5th. >> DOWN BY 2, TYING RUN ON FIRST, STATE-CHAMPIONSHIP GAME, DUDE. NO PRESSURE OR ANYTHING. >> [ CHUCKLES ] >> HERE WE ARE, AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 7th INNING, 1 OUT, RUNNERS ON FIRST AND THIRD FOR GIBSONBURG IN THE STATE-CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. RIGHT NOW THE SCORE IS FISHER CATHOLIC 5, GIBSONBURG 3. WELLS ON THE MOUND FOR FISHER CATHOLIC HAS BEEN A BEAST ALL DAY, BUT HE'S GOT ANDY GRUNER COMING UP TO THE ANDY GRUNER COMING UP TO THE PLATE. PLATE. AND GRUNER'S ACTUALLY GONNA LAY DOWN A BUNT. WE HAVE A SUICIDE SQUEEZE HAPPENING RIGHT HERE. MILLESON'S SAFE AT HOME, AND GRUNER SAFE AT FIRST. I DON'T THINK THAT FISHER CATHOLIC SAW THIS ONE COMING. >> I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ON EARTH SAW THAT PLAY COMING, AND HE EXECUTED IT PERFECTLY. WHAT A PLAY. >> AND GIBSONBURG NOW WITHIN A RUN. 5-4, FISHER CATHOLIC LEADS. WINNING RUN AT FIRST. WINNING RUN AT FIRST. DEREK HETRICK AT THE PLATE. DEREK HETRICK AT THE PLATE. HETRICK MAKES CONTACT, A DEEP FLY BALL. HE'S GONNA GET TO THE GAP IN LEFT CENTER. KISER COMES AROUND FOR THE SCORE EASILY. HERE COMES GRUNER, MOST LIKELY BEING HELD UP AT THIRD.
