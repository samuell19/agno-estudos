-You know, a bedroom is where you sleep. That’s the major selling point of a house. -Look who’s talking. You slept on the couch. -My bed’s in the shop. -I’m starving. What’d you make? -Just a little something. You still going out with Harry today? -Yes, are you coming with us? -No, I got to do something today. -What could you possibly need to do for you not come with us? -Something I’m not letting you talk me out of. Not today. -We can all go and help you out. -I rather you not interfere with this. -I won’t interfere with it. I swear. -You promise? -You can have my word. -We’ll see how far that gets me. We’ll got out if you guys are here for a while? -Awesome. -Hey, the service was good today. Wish you could’ve been there to see it. -You want a coffee? -I take it black with a ton of sugar. The homily was so inspiring. It was about remembering your past and move forward with God. I really wish you could’ve been there. -I’ll go with you soon. -It’s getting really hard to believe that. -I mean it. Next Sunday, all right? -I’m holding you to that. -We can get it done before we hit. -No, I want to take my time. -I wonder when Harry’s getting here. -No idea. Maybe you should damn cripple like the reason you can’t even walk. -I think it’s time for you to go. -What are you reading about? -The tax reform. -Well, bye, guys. Why did you tell me to leave? -It’s late. -Why? -Listen, you already know what you said and I’m not going to repeat it. I swear, if I ever hear you say something like that again, I have no idea what I’ll do to you. You have three beers and you go around thinking you can say things like that? Disrespecting me? I threw the party. I bought the beer. I keep you around. I do my best, so show some gratitude instead of calling me things like that. -I didn’t disrespect you. You disrespected me. I’m going to go cold on the ground. You could’ve told Rebecca to sit by me. -Do you like her now? Do you? That’s not my job. If you want something, you go and get it. You understand? Do you? -Yes. -All right, I’ve heard enough. Go to bed. -What are you? My dad? -I’m the closest thing you got. -So you went there? -You already went there. -Are you mad at me? -No, should I be? -No, I was just wondering why you were so quiet. -Alan, I’m reading this. You better not be smoking in my house. -I pay for this house too. -You better not be smoking in our house. -Is that custom? - Yes, I got it from my Uncle Jim. - It looks good on you. Just remember us when you make it into the big leagues, okay? -Of course. You’re going to try to make it with me, right? -Of course. -But you better go easy on that pizza. -Oh, pizza’s so good. -If you guys found a religion where you don’t need to wake up at dawn, please let me know. What are you guys even doing? -It’s blanket fort. -Blanket fort. -Come on in. We just want to play cards. -Bianca, you too? -Yes, it’s fun. Besides, I’d rather be here than at the field. -But the field is much more mature than some dumb, old blanket fort. -Blanket fort. -Who died and made Barclay 50? -I heard that. You want to go blanket fort, boy? -Blanket fort. -Come on, old man. -Nice blanket fort. Thanks, Bianca. -Hey, Leah. -So when I came over here, I wasn’t expecting to see something like this. Hi, Harry. -Hi, Leah. How are you? -I’m great. Why are you two fighting? -He insulted our blanket fort. -Yes, it hurt my feelings. -Did you cry? -A little. -You made Harry cry? How dare you? He wants to go to the field. -But it’s so cold out. -That hasn’t stopped us before. -I’m not going. -Why not? -Because I don’t want to. -Hey, are you guys okay? -It gets rough sometimes, but everything will be okay. -Trust me, okay? -Who else is coming? -Harry should be coming. -All right, let’s go. -Alan? Alan? Hey, you ready? Cool. -Barclay’s coming with us. -Well, does he want to or you’re forcing him to? -I’m coming on my own free will. Thank you. It’s too chilly not to have a shirt on, Alan. I take it you got home safe. -Yes, Becca barely had anything to drink last night. She only came because she wanted to see Alan. -Yes? Huh. -What does that mean, "Yes?" -Do you like her or do you not? -She’s okay. -That’s a no. -I didn’t say that. -Yes, yes. -I didn’t say that. She’s just not my type. -She’s breathing, ain’t she? -You wanted her to sit by you last night. -Yes, why didn’t you tell her? -I was going to, but... -Oh wait, you find her unattractive. That’s okay, buddy. We can fix that, you know. She can always shave off that mustache she has. You just got to let her borrow one of your razors. -There’s ways to fix that lazy eye. -Yes, or the extra toe. -All right, she’s not that bad. -What is your type anyway? -Leah. -Yes, I know. Hey, I can get you guys dinner. Would you like that? -I can pay if you want. -Don’t worry about it. I insist. -I’ve got money. -Hey, he offered to pay. Let him waste his money on us if he insists. Here, you’re up. -I wonder what she’s doing today. -Who? Becca? Scheduled on a Sunday. Bless her soul. Isn’t your girl driving her? -Yes, I’m not sure. -What are we doing today? Are we buying her flowers? -No, I’m buying a wedding ring. -You’re marrying her? Did you forget about Leah? -I’ve learned to accept it. You should too. -Where are you going to buy it from? -Either one of these two places. -The title "fiancé" doesn’t mean anything. There was a guy who worked at the brewery. He dumped his girl three weeks before the wedding all for a Brazilian cashier. -Are you saying I’m going to break up with Bianca for some South American girl scanning my milk? -Don’t count her out before you meet her. Those Brazilians, they’re real knockouts. -She doesn’t live with us. -I’ll pay her half. It’ll be like it was when she wasn’t with us. -Leah paid thirds. -Leah doesn’t matter anymore. We’ve moved on. -She’s watching over the field. What do I have to do to make you wait? -Wait till when? -I find a new house or a new roommate. -I’ll give you one a bet. If you can hit it to the guard end of your field, I won’t buy the ring. -With Harry’s ducks, no problem. -Rude. -No, my pitches. I’m who you’re betting, aren’t I? Deal? -Deal. -All right, but you can’t pitch because of your legs. -He won’t hit a thing. Start up the car. Look up the direction for that jeweler. -Okay, do what you guys got to do. -Ball one. Come on, Rusty, this isn’t golf. At least it made it over the plate. Strike- two. One more pitch. I’d swing if I were you. -Bring it on. This time, make sure I’m looking. -Are you ready? -Hey, you okay? -Look... -You all right? Here, take that. -Thanks. I struck out the slugger. -All right, let’s get your stupid ring. -You crying, man? -No, get the things, Harry. -Nice job, man. -You didn’t think I could do it, did you? I don’t blame you, neither did he. -All right, we’ll be there in no time. Just calm down. -I’m just excited, man. All this time, today, I finally get to buy the ring. -Yes, what style are you going to buy? -Well, my dad bought my mom a ring with two diamonds. That will represent the past and the future. Now, I want to get a ring with three diamonds. Two smaller ones will be like the past, the present, but then the bigger one would be for the future. I feel like that’s the most important one, right? -Yes, it makes sense. -Can you even afford three diamonds? -I’ve been saving for months and I even called the dude like five times. -You’re paying cash? -She reads my credit card bills. -You let her do that? -I don’t go to the strip club that often. She likes to worry, so let her worry, yes? -Who’s going to be the best man? -I haven’t even thought that far yet. -Why not? -Look, a man doesn’t need to worry about his whole life at a single moment as long as he gets stuff done. -Yes, I see. Pick someone funny for your best man, you know, give a good speech. -So definitely not you. Fine. Any likely candidates then? -Yes, he’s just far away at the moment. -If you could go back in time and change one thing, what would it be? -I don’t like delighting in hypotheticals. I mean, you need to think about the future and the present and things you can actually change. -I asked you, not Barclay. -I only like thinking about the future. I’m sorry. That’s me talking. -Okay, fine. Okay, so what is your biggest regret? Can I ask that? You can. Probably everything I did to Leah. -Leah? -Oh right, you never met Leah. She passed away before we met. Barclay dated her in high school and I used to try to break them up. It was a game I played out of infatuation. I mean, he came around after she died, but he waited about a year. -How long ago did she... -Three? No, four years ago. She was honestly one of the kindest women I’ve ever met. She was perfect for Barclay. The reason we call him Barclay is because of her. Sometimes I wonder if she hadn’t died, would they still be together? Would I have found someone or would I be alone? Then I think of all the kind words he said to me, "You’re my only one. I love you with every bit of my body." That makes me rest my head for a minute until I think that he probably said those words to her too. Then I get up and I drink some water and I look at the clock and it says 4:30 and I have to be up in two hours and my night’s ruined. What’s the thing you’d want to change? -I don’t know. Probably just my job. -You can change that, honey. That’s a thing of today. What’s the thing you want to change in the past? -I wish I wouldn’t have told Alan that I like him. -When did you do that? -A few months ago. I told him that I liked him and he looked at me with this scared and confused look. He was a kid back then, a scared kid trying to be an adult, but you never really become an adult, do you? You just learn how to get pissed at the small things, taxes, insults, your job. I mean, the whole glamour of it all is the freedom. Once you have to pay for rent and food and pay to stay alive, you lose all that freedom you got when you got out of school. He was still wishing he could be like us, huh? That’s why he was so scared. A grown woman telling him that she likes him and going on loving him, it may have been the realization that he needed and I’m just happy I was the one to do it. -Now, he tries to be like a kid. -What? -He still goes to the baseball diamond. -There’s nothing wrong with that. -No, but he needs to know that there’s a time and place for stargazing. He, Harry, and Barclay go out and come back and they’re yelling and they’re throwing stuff like they’re coming home from school. -I mean, did you ever go with them? -I did when I was younger, but I just got tired of Harry yelling at Barclay and Barclay yelling at Alan and Alan yelling at me. Three teenage boys do not play well with one teenage girl. There you go, forgetting Leah. She was the one that set me free. I remember watching her walk across the field to me while I was at-bat. -Go. I’m not mad at you. Just go. You don’t want to be here. In the game, it never mattered. It doesn’t matter if you had fun. -I just walked away and never looked back. -How do you think you’re going to propose? -During the beautiful sunset, I’m going to take her to the gazebo by the field. It’d be nice if you guys could be there. -Why are you making it such a big deal? -It’s a big moment. They say a proposal tells you everything about a marriage. -He has a point. I knew this guy from work who proposed to his girl in a McDonald’s, you know McDonald’s. She was so excited, man. She said yes. They invited me to the wedding. I went to the wedding. Guess where was that? McDonald’s, it was at McDonald’s. They had french fries and shakes and a playground and Ronald McDonald was there. It was crazy and it was classy. It was as classy as a wedding can be with a drive-through, but it was classy. They were fine for a couple of years. They ended up having five kids. The first, he went over it with me. The first was conceived on their honeymoon. Second was conceived on his birthday. Third and fourth were twins, conceived on her birthday. The fifth was a total accident like a broken condom or something like that. They were fine for a little bit and then he got laid off. He got fat like John Goodman in the ‘90s fat. She got stressed out. She’s getting wrinkles. She’s getting gray hair. She’s getting older. It must be really hard taking care of six kids. He was basically one of the kids. I count him. One day, she snapped and shot him five times in the chest while they were eating. -At McDonald’s? -No, no, at Burger King, but still, that’s beside the point. The point is to never let the corporate entities interfere with your romantic life. They make garbage food for garbage people. That’s it. -I guess I should thank you for that story, Harry. -Thanks, Harry. -Totally. -How are you feeling? -Super tired. I had a long day. -How about Bianca? -I’m excited. I don’t think anyone else can make me happier than she does. Honestly, I’ve never loved anyone more than I loved her. -Not even Leah? -That was then. With this, this is now. -Hoo. -Hey, I found you guys today. Harry, are you okay to drive home? -One drink doesn’t hurt me. -Cool, cool. You drive carefully. -Are you good? -Yes, I’m good. You? -Trust me. I will be fine. You can go back inside, have fun. You only live once. -You’re drunk. -We’ll be fine, okay? You don’t have to worry about us. It’s okay. -I don’t trust him. I don’t trust him, not right now. -Go, just go inside. Trust me, okay? Okay? It’ll be fine. I’ll see you back at the house, okay? - All right. - Okay. -Harry? -Huh? -You could stay for an hour or two, right? -Yes. Yes, all right. I’ll see you, man. -I’m dying with her. -Everyone, calm down. No one will have to die... -Remember how she’d look at him? Like he was a king. She’d fawn over him just to make him smile. -Yes, he’d do the same for her. -After she died, everything she worked so hard for was just being blown away like the dust on a sculpture. Instead of leaving a work of art, she’s leaving an unfinished masterpiece. Everyone she worked so hard to impress was forgetting her. They’re forgetting her inspirational words, her wonderful smile, her warm touch. Is that the meaning of life? To be forgotten? No, it’s to leave a legacy. -What’s your legacy? Play baseball with a drunk and a cripple? -It doesn’t matter what strangers know me. I have you. I have Barclay. -All right, but Barclay forgot Leah, remember? You say it all the time. You’ll go to the proposal then? -Do I need to? -He wants us there. -I don’t know if I can go. Are you taking off? -Yes, I have the PTO. Why wouldn’t I? -Then you can be the witness. -Man, he wants us there. It’s important to him, all right? I can’t let him down, neither should you. -I just have no intentions of going. -You guys live together, right? You see him every day. He’s been friends forever, so what... I don’t understand what more you want from him. -I’m not sure. You want one? -I doubt you have any idea you know what you’re doing. -It’s a simple drink. -Well, you’re over-pouring that simple drink. You like being 21 or what? -Yes, I have a feeling this is going to be my year. It’s been only what? Five days? -Two. -Two days. Only 363 more until I get my big chance. Don’t pique here. -Don’t say that. -You’re not done yet. -No, don’t say that. I know when I piqued and you do too. Just let me be happy for these two days. -All right, fine. The proposal, huh? -If he wants me there, he wants me there. -Think of Bianca’s smile when I ask her, guys. That’ll be life-changing, boys. It’ll be like a solar eclipse or a snowy night in December. Anyways, good night. -Just to answer your question, go to work tomorrow? -Yes. Are you going to just stick around? -No, I got to get going, man. I’ll be all right. I won’t die. Here. This tastes like crap, by the way. You’re terrible at it. You don’t know what you’re doing. It’s bad. It’s really bad. -I might get as good as you. I don’t want that, but... -We just need another Bernie Kosar, someone who has a cannon and control over the field, someone who can take the wheel when all the coaches have no idea what they’re doing. You know that happens way too often. -Well, it really does. That’s what the draft is all for. Tim in Cuyahoga Falls. That’s Tim in Cuyahoga Falls. Thanks, Tim. Now the Browns are in need of a guy like that. The city of Cleveland is in need of someone like that. You know, I’m tired of seeing these scrubs out on the field. They look like bums compared to what we had back in the ‘80s. We were good then, better than anybody, but then we lost the team. We lost the magic. I wonder where it went. Up next on The Experience... -Hello. How can I help you today? -Hi, where is Ms. Walker? -I’m here, Stefan. Oh, thank you, Angelica. I’ll take it from here. Come on. How was your weekend? Fun, I hope. -It was good. We threw a party for Alan. -Come on have a seat. How old is he now? -21. -No kidding. What’d you guys do? -Just had some drinks and hung out at the house. -No bars? -No bars. He said he only wants a drink with people he knew. -My husband sent you, right? -That’s right. -How’s he treating you? -Okay, it’s just getting a little tired and my knees start to sag up. -When they told me you were coming today, I got excited. It’s not every day I get to see you. I don’t know what’s going with you and Bianca anymore. Neither of you call, so I worry. Starting to make me feel like I’m forgotten. That’s what happens when young people fall in love. They get forgetful. Wait, what was I looking for? The envelope. I have a feeling you’re afraid of me. -Why do you say that? -Just a blind assumption. I can hear your heart beating. You’re hiding something from me. -I bought a ring yesterday. -You’re marrying my daughter? -That’s the plan. -Do you have the ring? -I do. -I’m going to have grandkids. Are you going to live together? -I hope so. -With Alan? -Yes, all three of us. -I’m not opposed to the three of you living together, but Alan, he’s a good kid, but he’s got to get his head in the shoulders. -His head is on his shoulders. What are you even talking about? He works, he cleans, he pays his rent. -He’s not fit to be with my daughter. He has to drive. I can’t have him hanging around my grandchildren. I can’t have him sitting on the kitchen table calling him Uncle Alan, learning how to drive from Uncle Alan, being taken to school by Uncle Alan, being kissed a good night by Uncle Alan just makes me sick. What happens when you’re tired and you fall asleep and then Bianca’s caring for the kids and Alan offers to take them off her hands, and then he smokes in front of them or takes them to the track or goes into one of those trances where he mumbles under his breath and the kids will just be scared and alone? I want to be part of their life too. -I never said you couldn’t. Look, Alan’s not going to make you not the grandmother. -I just never imagined them living like that. -Well, I’m sorry. We’re not going to be the family that you imagine and Alan’s staying with us. -What’s your price? -Price? -What is it? A car? A house? Money? A job? If you work for me, you’ll have an office and a title and I’ll offer you more money than hospice paying you. I just cannot allow Uncle Alan. -What do you want me to do? Drive him to a bridge and drop him off? -That’s not out of the picture. -You’re insane. He’s a good kid. -I know what he did to Leah. -How did you know? -I’m not stupid. You play it cool, but I know. I don’t want him in the same house as my baby girl. This is what I’ll do. My office, it has a scholarship. -What does he have to do? -Just about the paperwork. -Okay, after the wedding, I’ll drive to the airport, drop him off at college. Then after that, we’ll go on a honeymoon. -I don’t want him at that wedding. He’ll start a fight or be a nuisance. -He won’t do that. I swear. -I don’t want him there. -He’s supposed to be my best man. -If that’s the case, forget about my offer. The college, the job, everything. -Give Hassan my regards. -Nothing’s going to hurt you, baby girl. No -Going down to the plate to throw the ceremonial first pitch, Number 38, Alan Kluszewski. -If he makes it to the proposal, he can stay. -Hey, I made it. -Hey, Alan. -Hey. -I made it. -I don’t care. -Why are you getting mad at me? -I’m not mad at you. -Hey, quit talking about me. Let’s go, Bianca. Wait, wait, wait. You shouldn’t flatter yourself. We’re not always talking about you. Every time you come around, you think we’re talking about you. "Alan will get better. Alan will come around soon. He’s at a rough point in his life." It’s all been said before. Now, I’m going to get a damn sandwich. Are you coming, Rebecca? -I’m going to stay with Alan. -Figures. -I drove with Rebecca. -Here, take my car. -Take your car? -Take my goddamn car. -Don’t you have to go back to work? -Screw them. -Okay, where do you want me to take you? -Home. -Okay, let’s get you home. Do you need anything to eat? -Let’s get some tacos and a six-pack. -Make it a 24-pack and I’m down. -That’s a lot. -I like to drink. -What are you? Harry? -That’s why I just don’t go to the bronze games anymore. I just don’t. I’m like, "No, too violent. No, thank you." -Oh, my God. What are your dreams? -My dreams? -What did you want to be when you grew up? -I wanted to be third baseman in the Majors. How about you? -I wanted to work in a city. In one of those tall buildings where you can see the whole world. There, you didn’t have to be put on a pedestal. You were already high enough. If I was there, I don’t think I would feel so sad when people would look through me. Hey, what’s that tattoo? I’ve been meaning to ask you. -It’s for Leah. The L herself. -Can I ask you a question? -Yes, go ahead. -That one night, were you mad that I told you how I felt? -Why would I be mad? I don’t judge you at all. I kind of feel the same way about you. -You do? Then why did you treat me like you did? -I was grieving. Well, I still am. I just think I’m past the initial sting right now, but then, every day, I look through my phone, and then I see Leah. I think if I just try to call her, I’ll hear her voice one more time. I like to think that everything that happened, it’s just happier. I was just happier then. -You shouldn’t live in that over-sentimental past forever. You’ll never truly be happy. -Everyone else does it. The music, the movies, the sports teams, they all do it, but they just call it a franchise. Who says that I can’t live in a personal nirvana? Next, you’ll say is just forget it all. -I never said forget. You’re supposed to move forward from the past. Remember it. Don’t live in it. Live now, Alan. -You’re now sounding like Barclay. Living it now. Living it then. If you look in the collection of the pictures, you won’t see one picture of Leah. That’s living in the now. Hide it away. Go ahead. Look, you’ll get enough time to look at them when you’re leaving. -I’ve had way too much to drink. I can’t drive. -Then sleep on the couch. -Why are you acting like this? -Because you upset me. -After everything I’ve done for you? -Guess it wasn’t enough. -Becca, are you going to be okay? -Yes. Barclay and I just got into a little fight. We’ll be fine. Don’t worry about us. -I’m going to get you a blanket. -Do you even want me here? I can go. I can go sleep in my bed. I don’t care. -The things I said, I didn’t mean them. I never meant them. I just get like that when I’m drunk and then I start using my mouth, and then I just don’t know where I’m going anymore and I’m tired. What the hell do you want me to do? -Trust me. -Are you excited? -Yes. No, I’m nervous, you know? What’s next, you know? -I mean, it’s your choice, but I’d say stick with baseball. Go to college. Have some fun. Learn something new. It’s never too late to start that search. Don’t tell Barclay about this. It’s not the full tuition, but it’ll help. -Where did you get this kind of money? -Just between some couch cushions, under-car mats, and a little prostitution. No, but I’ve just been saving it and hiding it from Barclay. -Why are you giving this to me? -Because I love you. You deserve a little boost from everything you did this past year. Tomorrow you’ll graduate. After the ceremony, we’ll go to a real college party. The first of many for you. All right? -All right. I love you too. -I got to go. I’ll take the box. Please don’t come straight home. -Let’s go to the lake. -No. Not tonight. Could you just get me some milk and cigarettes, please? -What’s wrong? -Nothing. Here’s the money. -You let everyone watch as you went behind my back. Now I know why you get out of bed every night. -That is not the reason. -Did you do it in my house? -Yes. -Do I not do enough for you two? I pay the bills. I buy the food. I’m the only one that’s doing something around here and you go around messing with him? You two are just so happy together, aren’t you? I thought you loved me, not that bastard. Fuck, you’re forgetting about me. I have needs too and when things arise for him... Forget about us. Honestly, just go be with that worthless orphan. -Barclay. -Damit. -It’s okay, Alan. Do not help us talk about it. -I am not talking to him. -Oh, what are you doing? -I’m going to Harry’s. -No. Harry cannot know about this. Nobody can find out about this. Not Harry, not Bianca, not my mother. I don’t want them thinking any less of me. -God forbid. -Stefan, this is all I have left. -All right. I won’t tell at all. -What do we do now? -We go on. Live like this never happened, like this never existed. -I love this. I can’t live without this. -You lived without it for 18 years. Forget it. You’ve never seen my chest, you’ve never felt my legs, and you’ve never heard my heart. Those feelings we have, the past few months, they’re all gone. I still love you. I love you so much but find some other girl to enjoy your life, okay? I have a party tomorrow. Don’t hang around me and Barclay, all right? -You’re the only girl that I know. -Barclay will kill you literally. He’ll take a knife and stab you and throw. -I don’t care. -Can you at least let me say it one more time. Let it sweep my tongue one last time. I love you, Leah. I love you too. I’m sorry about your shirt. -It’s okay my little L. -Good morning. -Good morning. -You want some coffee? -Yes, please. Sorry, you had to find us like this. -It happens. Cream or sugar? -Yes. Has this happened before? -Not exactly. Can I get you something to eat? -There’s not enough food in the world to satisfy this hunger. -Try me. -Just a bagel with cream cheese will do just fine. Why are you doing this? -I always feed my guests. -Thank you. -How did this happen? -My memory is fleeing me. All I remember is drinking too much and Alan’s tattoo. -Okay. I’m going to need more, Rebecca. -He was finally happy with me. My body was okay. Is that good enough for you? -Yes. -Why are you trying to dig? -I’m not trying to dig. -Are you not sure if he likes me or not? Could it be love? I don’t know but for the hour while we were huddled under the covers before we fell asleep, I didn’t care if it was love or not. He whispered I love you’s and stay with me’s until I fell asleep in his warm arms. If that’s not love, then I don’t know what is. -I think he’s deluded. -He isn’t. If he was, would he look at me with a spark in his eyes when he kissed my lips? He needs me. -He needs to go to church. Every week I tell him to go but instead he pulls stunts like this. For all we know, he could be using you. -Why would he do that? -To stay here in this house in Cleveland to ruin my life. -He wouldn’t do that. -There are facts that say otherwise. He’s always wanted my life. -Don’t say that. It’ll ruin everything we have. -You have nothing. Last night was an accident. He’s using you. -Well, maybe I’m okay with that. -Look, last night was a lie. Whatever he told you, it wasn’t true. He’s only loved one girl. -Who? -It doesn’t matter if I tell you the name or not. It’ll just be a name to you. -Are you trying to get rid of him? Because I won’t let you kick him out like he’s trash? -I got the scholarship papers from Bianca’s mother’s office. He’ll get to chase his dreams, Rebecca. -Bianca’s mom? -Do you not get how big of an opportunity this is for him? He’d get to go play baseball wherever he wants to and he doesn’t have to stay in this crappy city where it snows in the spring and heat waves hit in the fall. I would love to keep him around but this is an opportunity where he just can’t pass up. -When were you planning on telling him? -I wasn’t. He would never understand it coming from me. -Why not? -Because of the wedding. I can’t bear the fact that I have to reject him like that. -I’ll tell him. -You don’t have to do that. -I can do it way better than you ever could. -All right. I owe you. Okay, I got to get my stuff. -Huh? -Didn’t I tell you? Oh, I guess I didn’t tell anyone. I got a job at Bianca’s mother’s office. It gets me off my feet so that’s a plus. -Congrats. -It’s right by the stadium too. I can literally see the fireworks. -That’s good for you. What will you be doing? -Marketing stuff. It’s a job. -Yes. -Let me get going. -Hi. -Hi. -Are you hungry? -What time is it? 9:30. -It’s too early. -You have to wake up at some point. -I need my sleep. -Barclay got a new job today. -Really? -Yes. I think it’s good. It gets him off his feet. He won’t have to worry about that leg anymore. Guess where? By the Jake. Now, he can go to the games in the morning and then go to work at night, right? Hey, how come you don’t go to church anymore? Barclay seemed pretty upset that you don’t go. Want to go to church with us on Sunday? Hmm? Alan wake up? Want to go to church on Sunday? -I don’t know. -You need to know God. -I know him enough. -Listen, I’m not going to argue with you, but you got to get up. -Fine. -Barclay told me about this offer that Bianca’s mom is giving out. It’s a scholarship at her job. I think you should go for it. You can finally be a third baseman like you said. Doesn’t that sound great? -Yes, I’ll look into it. -Don’t just say you’ll look into it and then you never think about it again. Look, he left the papers here. Don’t you just want to fill them out? -Want to get some breakfast? -I’m serious, Alan. Look, let’s just read it. It says here all you have to do is receive straight A’s and succeed in your extracurriculars. That sounds simple. School is easy. Doesn’t that sound good? -Want some cheese? -I’m serious. -When would I have to leave? -It says here by the set orientation date or no later than August 31st. No exceptions. -Just say no. -Why not? -Barclay’s wedding is in September. I got to go. He eased up some of those things between me and him. -He was the one who told me about this. He’s okay with it. That was one of his biggest concerns about you missing the wedding. It’s all going to work out. I know it. -Here’s 40 bucks. Go to Diana’s and get me a turkey club, all right? Get whatever you want. -I’m not hungry. You need to sign these papers. -Just leave me alone. Hey, I’ll tell you my decision next time I see you, all right? -You promise to think about it while I’m gone? -Yes, go. -Hey, you’re still going to batting practice with, Harry, right? -Yes, I can. -He’s going to work there for a year, then go to college, then off to the minors. He has to pay for school somehow. -Yes, somehow. -Time to go. -Shouldn’t I get more dressed up? -It’s too late for that now, let’s go. Did we decide who’s paying for this thing? -The life insurance isn’t paying for it? -It expired last month. -Can we just split it? -I don’t have that kind of money. -I’ll get it. -What’s in the box? -$8,000 that Leah gave me. It was supposed to go to my college but at least it’s going to go to something way more important. -Time to go. -Why? -Bianca’s coming over and I want the house to ourselves. Oh, and can you help me put away some of these pictures. It’s so full up here. -These are all of Leah. -Yes, I just don’t like them anymore and it’s not because of her. Look at my face in this one. -You said that’s your favorite picture. -That was a long time ago. You got any plans for today? -I get to see what Harry’s doing. Why can’t I stay? -Bianca gets all weird when you’re in the house. -Does she get weird or do you get weird? -Okay, she’s here. All right, I’ll see you tomorrow. -Oh, hey, Bianca. I was just leaving. I know how much you guys like your privacy. All right. I’ll see you guys. -Hey, how are you. -Hey. -It’s good to see you. How was your drive? -It wasn’t too bad. -That’s good. -I forgot my jacket. Proceed. -Hey. -He’s not here. He’s at his new job. Another thing little Ms. Sunshine. Your fiance is kicking me out. -What? -I know you hate me and I understand why. I get in your way. Well, lucky for you I’m not going to be in your way anymore. Go ahead, spawn 50 kids, name them after the apostles or the books of the Bible. I don’t care. I don’t give a damn anymore. Okay? Just don’t say that you missed me because I know that that would be a lie. Barclay told me enough times that you don’t want me around. -He doesn’t speak for me. You don’t bother me. I’m not bothered by having you around. It doesn’t bother me if you stay here. This house is big enough for four people. I don’t hate you, Alan. I mean you’ve never wronged me. Even if you did, I’ve forgiven you. Alan, I think Barclay needs to too. I’ll talk to him. -I’m sorry. -Don’t worry about it. -Are you almost done with this? -Yes. -Brian talked to you yet? He’s pretty pissed you ditched last night. You should’ve just called off, man. -It’s whatever. -How was your night? -Oh it was okay. I slept with Rebecca. -Huh? Wow, you guys must have really liked that. -It was okay. Nothing too special. -You all right? -I just feel like I’m on the verge of an existential crisis. -Care to explain? What do you mean? -Barclay’s kicking me out. -Oh, you need a place to crash? -No, he’s giving me a scholarship. Yes, that’s it. -So? -I’ll have to miss the wedding. -Does Barclay know about this? -Yes, I think that’s why he wants me to go. He doesn’t want me here. -I think it’s a good deal. You get to go to school, meet a bunch of babes, get to play baseball with some real baseball players. The downside’s what? You miss their wedding? What are you going to do? -What should I do? -What should you do? You should take it, honestly. The wedding doesn’t matter. When you leave, they won’t be married. When you come back, they’re married. Cool. They’re still going to be in love, they’re still going to be your friend. -I can’t agree. -Why are you so intent on staying in here? -I have a good-paying job. I have a possible girlfriend and I live in a house, an actual house. What else could I want? The American Dream. -Yes, but you hate it here, the job sucks, your girlfriend’s not guaranteed and you’re getting kicked out of the actual house. Dude, have you seen yourself hit? You’re a monster out there. You’re going to waste that? What you don’t know now is that you’re still young enough to try, dude. If you try and you fail, so what? You failed. You’re a failure, congrats. Rather be a failure than a loser. You can take it from someone who waited their life away. I had something like you had. 6 years and 20 pounds go. 30 pounds. I’m being modest. I waited. I was too scared to chase after it. Kept telling myself that life would catch up when the time is right and the time was never right. If I had taken a risk, took some classes, took time out of my day every day to practice a little bit, quit this stupid job I’d be on bigger and better things. It’s why fate ha us here, man. You have the opportunity you have and I’m still here. I’m always going to be here. If you ask me I’m going to tell you to take it. I’m going to tell you to take it this second. Right now. It’s your turn. Go on, do bigger and better things. I know you can do it. -I’m not like you. -Not like me? -I’m not. -What does that mean? -I don’t drink like you. I am working hard at it. I’m working hard. -You’re stuck in here, aren’t you? You’re not out there doing anything. You’re afraid. -I’m doing enough. Okay? -There’s more. I said what I said. It’s up to you now, man. Look, some of the guys are getting beers after work. You’re going to come or you’re going to keep working hard? -I really don’t know. -Just one drink, man. What else are you going to do? -Yes, I will do it. -All right. I’m going to go check on this last order. I’m out. Think about what I said. -What did you tell Alan? -Nothing. -Then why does he think you’re kicking him out of the house? -I don’t know why. -Yes, you do. Also, why does he think I hate him? -He’s probably just jealous. -Or because you told him I can fight my own battles. -This isn’t a battle you need to fight. I got this. -But you wrote me in when you told him I hated him. -I didn’t tell him anything. -What does that mean, Barclay? -Rebecca told him all about the scholarship. -Rebecca? You would take in this kid for nine years and you can’t even muster up the courage to tell them bad news? If something bad happens are you going to tell me or you’re going to have Rebecca do it for you? -It’s not bad news. Your mother’s given him a chance to go to college. -My mother? When did you talk to my mother? -A few weeks ago. She gave me this job. -You’re working for my mother? There’s a reason I haven’t talked to her in ages. -Why. -She didn’t go to the funeral. -Which one? -You should know. Not many people die in our lives. She would have wanted her there. A mother should have to go to all of her kids’ funerals. It doesn’t matter how distant they were. -She must have tried. It couldn’t have been easy, he and her daughter died. -You were there. What happened? -I told you we were at a party and we left. We started arguing. -About what? -It doesn’t matter. I was driving, we started arguing, I was swerving and then I crashed. It took forever for help to arrive. Leah had already passed away by then and Alan was still at the party when he found out but when he came home he wasn’t crying or anything. Just stone-faced. Leah lost her life and I lost my knee. I guess I’m the lucky one and I have you. -Was it your fault? -It was a mistake. -Don’t tell me that. -I was careless. It was just a mistake. -Then why didn’t Leah drive? -Leah was drunk. -Then why didn’t Alan? -We needed a moment to ourselves without them listening in. -Why? Why? -There was a problem with Leah. -He was a saint. She treated you like a king. -She did too much. -She gave you everything and then that night when we... There wasn’t a problem with Leah. There was a problem with you. With us. -We weren’t the first ones. -You keep talking in these vague poetic terms. What does that mean exactly, Barclay? -Allen, Leah, they weren’t the pure souls you thought they were. -They? Is that why you want him out? Revenge isn’t the right thing to do. -He’ll be chasing his dream. -On your schedule. He could have had a plan. -Alan, have a plan? Doubt it. All he does is sit around and wait for Leah or death. -You know what? You’re going to discuss this plan with him when you get home. I’ll be waiting for you. I’ll see you later, Barclay. -Wait, wait. You know you’re going to be a Barclay too once we’re married. What are you going to call me then? -When we get married? Maybe we’re thinking too far into this too fast. -What? What are you talking about? -I think you should get your life together before we get married. -Whoa, whoa, whoa. If he stays you’ll marry me but if he leaves you won’t? -Don’t start putting words in my mouth. -Let’s back this out. You’re joking, right? You’re kidding. -He’s an adult. He can make his own decisions. -Hey, I was just about to make a pot of coffee. Do you want some? I understand it’s a little late for coffee. -It’s a little late for a lot of things. -Anyways I need a drink. Give me some do with my hands but I see you already have one. -Is there something that you want to talk to me about? -Looks like you already heard what it was. -I want to hear from your mouth. -Harry called today. He said that your boss is pissed you never showed up yesterday. -That’s not what I’m talking about. -I think it’s time to go to bed. -That won’t let you forget about this. -Can I at least get my medicine? -I won’t let you put it back any longer. -For one my leg hurts and you’re not going to talk to me like I’m some little kid. You’re going to treat with dignity and respect. What do you even want to talk about? -The scholarship. -What about it? -I won’t miss your wedding. -Why are you so intent on this? -Because what if I come back and there’s a four-year-old kid there that I never even met and I didn’t even know existed? What if I come back and there’s a new family? What if there’s a new house built on the foundations of this one? -That’s a risk you have to take for your future. -Well, it’s selfish. -Look, everyone needs to be selfish at times. We all deserve that time to ourselves. You’ll get away from us. Away from Cleveland. You can come back at any time. -Why can’t I just study here? Hey, I’ll go to CSU. I’ll study and work here. -No, you can’t stay here if you take that offer. -Why not? It’s more than... -Alan, I don’t want you here. I don’t want you here. I’m sorry, I don’t. -You’ve finally accepted it. You admit it. Why? -You smell like smoke. You eat all my food. You don’t even go to church when I asked you to. -Can you quit it with that church thing? Seriously, God doesn’t give a damn whether I go or not. -Watch your mouth. -How about all the times I didn’t say, "Oh, I’m coming home late." Huh? How about that time that I didn’t buy chocolate for you and Bianca on Valentine’s Day because you were like, "Oh, it’s too late." How about Leah? Are we going to talk about her ever? -I don’t want to get talking about her every day like you. -You’re forgetting about her. -Okay. If I’m forgetting about her, then why when I roll over, I expect to hold her? Not Bianca. Her. Or why when I’m home alone and I hear things, I call out for Leah? Why do I think about gifts that she would like? I mean, yes, I’m not going into trances and thinking about her every day like you do, but I’m not forgetting about her. I keep it inside, and that’s power. I don’t turn to cigarettes and beer. You’re weak. You have no idea what pain feels like, so don’t tell me. I do. I loved her. Don’t tell me I didn’t love her. -You know what? Loving her doesn’t mean putting her in the linen cabinet. I wouldn’t hide it away if I loved somebody. -You know, I’m not hiding. It’s just that, she lived here once and she’s gone now, Alan. I moved on from those scars. You should follow in my footsteps. -Why would I sell out, Barclay? -Oh. I get it. It’s not the scholarship. You don’t want to go into the real world. You’re afraid. You need to man up, Alan. This is a great offer. The time is now. -That was then. I heard that garbage for the last few months. Sometimes, you’ve got to keep things, both of them, at your forefront of your mind. You can’t just say, "Oh, this is my life now. I mean, forget all that." That was your life too. -Look. You can’t let someone that’s not here keep you from living your life, and that means more to me than you know. Alan, you not being able to let Leah go, she’s going to call off the wedding. -Good. You have no right, no right marrying her sister. I was okay. I could put up with this job, and that’s fine. I can work. I can live, and die. I’m fine with that. I loved her. Don’t go on saying, "Oh, I loved her. She was the most beautiful person ever. Her eyes were blue like the sky." Oh my God, what is wrong with you? You think you’re a poet and all that. When she died, you were supposed to be there for everybody. You just ran away and forgot. How about you remember her once? -You were right. Good for you. -Yes. I just kind of wish I didn’t hit him. -It’s what he deserved. -Yes, I guess. -So, you’re going to go back to work and beg for forgiveness, right? -I can. It’s a little demeaning, but it’s, whatever. -Good. At least you can go see the wedding. Just make sure you get there early, you don’t want to get a crappy seat. -I’ll be on the altar. What are you talking about? -Not after all this, no. I mean, you won’t be the best man, that’s for sure. Not after the scholarship. My best bet is Harry. He’s a good kid, at least. So, are you going to get with Rebecca now? -Yes, I can. -That’s good. It’s not like you’re disrespecting me at all. -Are you saying I shouldn’t be with anyone else? -Unless you treat them the way you did with Rebecca last night, no. -How did I treat her any different than you? -You didn’t make love to her. You made love to me. Now, you’ll think about me every hour, every day. It’s like we’re getting married like we always wanted. -But you’re not here. It’s Rebecca. -But you’ll only see me. Isn’t that wonderful? -I can be doing everything like I have been doing. -Yes. Don’t have to worry about the money. -Oh my God. I’m sorry for not using the money from college before. -It’s fine. That was before I died. Now I want to be with you. I want to be close to you. -And I can be miserable. -We can be together. -How far does that get me when I’m the only one living? I don’t want to be at this job forever. What if there’s a girl out there, just waiting for me? If I stay, I’ll never know. I defy you. -What? What about what we had? Alan? Where are you going? Alan, don’t do this, please. -Everything we want is at our fingertips. Alan Klasewski, on third, playing in the majors. This entire time, I’ve been worrying about what you had to say. You’re just a ghost. A ghost of someone that I never knew. Leah wanted me to leave. Yes, she loved me, but she cared about me leaving more than anyone else. You? You’re forcing me to stay. Are you a curse that she casted, or some nightmare that I had one night? I don’t belong here. The job is hell, but you’re saying it’s heaven. The house is small, but you’re saying it’s just enough. I’m in love with Leah, but you’re not her. Leah would have told me the truth months ago. That the job is hell. That house is too small. Yes, there are two Leahs, but there are also two Alans. This one, who wants to be safe at home, and work at a brewery, that he has no passion in. Eight hours a day, I sit around and count things. That is what I want to do. That is what I want to do with my life. Day in, day out. I become old and decrepit and die. Or, they fire me, and I try to kill myself because that’s all that I know. Then there’s me. The Alan that I dreamed about ever since I was young. The Alan that I dressed up as when I was eight. I don’t belong here. I belong where sport and competition live. Here, I’m weak and unchallenged. I play baseball with a cripple and a drunk. I’m weak and unchallenged. There, I’ll be the best. If I fail, I fail. That’s how it’s supposed to be. That’s the way it is. I’m sorry, Leah. I’m sorry, Leah. -So this is how it’s going to be? Bye, Alan. -Goodbye, Leah. I hope you had fun. Are those the papers? I’m going to college. -I don’t think I’m ready to say goodbye. -Me either. Do you think it’s because of me? -No. No. There are these white moths that fly into the factory from time to time. Hear me out. They’re lost but they’re beautiful to look at. One of the old Greek guys calls them souls lost... souls trapped in the worst cage. The girls will go around and they’ll take pieces of paper, put the moths on them and take them to the window, let them outside. I think that Alan is like the moth and Barclay is like the girls leading him to the window, and the scholarship is the paper carrying him. He was never meant to be in the factory. He ended up there. I think it’s nice that he’s being let out by his friend. -It’s still so hard to say goodbye. It is with moths too. No seriously, there are so many things out there that are just dying to eat them, but at least they’re free, right? We can agree on that? Go say goodbye. I’ll meet you out there. -All right. -Go. -Bye, Alan. -I’ll see you. -I hope Barclay won’t mind- -Not at all. If I give this to you to take on your journeys. -Not at all. You’re all set? -Yes I think so. Harry are you ready? -I’ve been ready since you bought the ticket, baby. -Okay, hey, maybe I’ll see you during Christmas. -Maybe. Read that bible. -Yes, I will. -Bye, Alan. -I’ll see you, Bianca. -Did you forget something? -Yes there’s something I’ve got to do. -Wow, that’s a lot. Couldn’t leave the air running?
