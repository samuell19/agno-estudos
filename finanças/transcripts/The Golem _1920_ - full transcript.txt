No contemporary version of "The Golem, how he came into the world" has survived. From the exposed negative material, two original negatives with different camera positions were assembled. The Negative A, cut from the best takes, survives in the Cinematek (the royal film archive of Belgium. For the American edition 1921 it had been heavily altered with changes and cuts. The current version attempts the best authentic restoration of the A-negative to approximate the lost German version. Missing parts were restored where possible with the help of a duplicate of the American circulation copy of the George Eastman Museum. Other completions come from a copy of the Cinematheque francaise, made from the B-negative. Most of the original title cards survive in the A-negative. Completing titles hail from Gosfilmfond of Russia, the main title from the Museum of Modern Art. Missing titles were rendered in a neutral font based on a censor card. The model for the tinting was a historical Italian circulation copy of the Fondazione Cineteca Italiana. The Golem, how he came into the world.

"I must speak with rabbi Jehuda - our people are facing an impending calamity." "Summon all the community elders to the temple, so that they may pray to Jehovah throughout the night. The stars foretell disaster!" DECREE AGAINST THE JEWS. The many serious charges against the jews can no longer be disregarded, being that they crucified our lord, wrongfully ignore the holy christian holidays, thirst after the goods and lives of their fellow men, and practice the black arts. Hence we decree that all jews evacuate their quarter, known as the ghetto, before the new moon. "Knight Florian - you must deliver our edict to the jewish quarter immediately." "Venus is entering the Libran constellation, and the time now favours the invocation. I must wrest the crucial life-giving word from the dreaded spirit Astaroth, that will bring the Golem to life and save my people." "An envoy from the emperor is waiting outside." "If there is any compassion within your young heard, you will accompany me to the revered rabbi L?w. He represents the heard and voice of this jewish community." "I was the one who drew up the emperor's horoscope - and twice I have warned him of danger. Now - go and tell him that I have a secret message for him." End of chapter one. Chapter two. "The hour is almost upon us. The alignment of the stars now favours the invocation of the spell." "Can you keep a secret from all mankind?" Knight Florian arrives with another message from the emperor. In memory of your services, we will grant you an audience. Come to the Rose Festival at the castle and amuse us again with your magic arts. "Soon my dear, you shall have a guardian." This figure named "the Golem" was created in classical times by a Thessalonian sorcerer. If the life-awakening word is placed in the amulet on his chest, he will be alive as long as he wears it. This symbol is called the "shem". "Who can reveal the crucial word that will bring the golem to life?" Necromancie. The art of bringing dead beings to life. Astaroth is the guardian of a life-giving word that will awaken any and every thing, whether corpse or man's creation. Whoever possesses the key of Salomonis and knows the "Great Spell" can compel Astaroth to reveal the word insofar as he awaits an auspicious constellation of the planets. "The hour has come!" "Astaroth! Astaroth appear! Appear! Name the word!" "On behalf of the lord of the spirits - name the word!" "The word - that terrible life-giving word. I have snatched it from the evil, dark powers that be. I shall now call the Golem to life." End of chapter two. Chapter three. A strange servant. "That's my new servant." Golem's first errand. "This is the rabbi's new servant, who is unable to speak. He will come here every day in my stead, from now on. Please give him everything on the list and he will do you no harm." "I have been invited to the castle today, so you shall mind the house. The Golem will accompany me, as I wish to present him to the emperor." The Rose Festival. When your father arrives at the castle I will steal away from the festival -- I have bribed the gatekeeper -- place a lamp in the window as a sign that you are waiting for me. "He is my servant - and my creation. He is called Golem. I cannot say any more than this." "What form of marvel are you displaying for us today - you strange illusionist? Show us more of your great art." "Let me show you our jewish patriarchs, o mighty emperor, You may better come to know and understand our people. Though to avoid a tragic disaster, I must request that none may laugh of speak." "Ahasuerus, the wandering jew." "Save me... and I will pardon your people!" End of chapter three. Chapter four. "The emperor has pardoned all the jews - we are saved. Awaken our sleeping brethren with the joyous sounds of the shofar!" "It is a fact! The watchman told me himself. Revered rabbi L?w has returned from the emperor, bearing the pardon. Rejoice ye, rejoice!" If you have brought an inanimate being to life through magic beware of your creation. When Uranus enters the house of the planets, Astaroth will reclaim his instrument. Then the lifeless clay will turn against its master, intent on deceit and destruction. "Golem, your task is completed. Once again become lifeless clay, so that we may avoid any vengeance sought by the dark powers." "Master, master! Revered rabbi L?w! Jehuda is waiting below with the elders, to escort you to the temple for thanksgiving prayers." "When they are all at the temple, you can sneak away." "Miriam has not heard yet. She is still sleeping." "I cannot open the door now. You go on ahead!" "No, no, I will wait. I want to go to the temple with you." "A strange man is in her room. Drive him away!" End of chapter four. Chapter five. "Your house is in flames. The golem has gone on a rampage!" "The demon! The demon has carried Miriam away. Stop him or he will destroy everything." "Save us, rabbi! Recite the fire spell or we shall all perish!" "The revered rabbi L?w has saved our people a second time. Let us all gather at the gate and thank him." "Revered rabbi L?w, the people are all coming. Thank you for exorcising the fire." "Can you forgive me? The rabbi's house lies ruined in ashes, and every trace of the stranger has vanished. As no one suspects anything, I shall remain silent." "The Golem, the Golem!" "Where is the Golem?" "The Golem has forced the gate open!" "Give all thanks to jehovah. He has saved his people for the third time today." The end.
