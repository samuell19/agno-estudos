11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17... TWO OF US Let's see this on you. - You think that's for me? - For sure. Try it on, trust me. - All right. - I was thinking... We could rent a place in central Rome by the Tiber. The Tiber, yes. But it's way beyond our budget. Really? You think? You'll see. We'll find a beautiful apartment. With a big terrace. With the new friends we'll make, we can be who we want. I'll say I'm a former international swimmer, a gold medal winner at the Olympics. Mom? Ok? Not too hot? No, just fine. I tried to reach your brother on the phone. You know what he's like. He could answer when I call. Mom, stop constantly chasing after him. He's not a kid anymore. - Don't be so hard on him. - Hard? Shit. What's wrong? Nothing. - Tell me what's wrong. - Nothing. Whatever I say, you'll take his side. As always. Untrue. You're talking nonsense. So when Fred accuses you of cheating on dad, why sit and take it? I don't know how you do it. It's pointless discussing it. Yes, you're right. Nina... It's time. Coming? Yes, Mr. Brémont. Come on up, top floor. See you in a moment. - Some shots of the living room? - Of course. Take your time. Hold on... And one here. Excuse me. Morning. - I do hope I'm not interrupting. - Not at all. - Do come in. - Thank you. Mr. Brémont came to see my apartment. - Pleased to meet you. - Mrs. Dorn lives opposite. An identical apartment to Mrs. Girard's. I'd like to know your expert opinion. Spacious rooms, well laid out. - Impeccable. - Very quiet, too. - If you want me to visit, just say so. - You have all you need? - Yes, thank you, Mrs. Girard. - Excellent. - A pleasure meeting you. - It's mutual. - Don't forget the disclosure form. - Of course. - Before it goes on the market. - I'll do it tomorrow. Good. I'll call you this week to set up an appointment. Absolutely. Perfect. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mr. Brémont. Well? You couldn't keep your nose out, could you? How much did he say? 250,000. 250,000? Look inside the envelope. Rome. My apartment isn't for sale yet. Yes, I know, but I thought we could start looking for our new home. We said no unnecessary spending until we find a buyer. Don't worry. I've thought of everything. What? Mado? Changed your mind? I said I'd tell them tomorrow. Tell them what? What we agreed. That I'm selling the apartment. And moving to Rome. Happy birthday! Thank you, sweetie. Théo, a kiss for Granny. Happy birthday, mom! For you. - That's very kind. - It smells great. - Hi, mom. - Hello, Frédéric. - Karine isn't with you? - She had work to do. Théo, a kiss for Granny, I said. Not that again. Grow up, dammit. - You ok? - Yes. - And you? - Yeah, I'm ok. A bit tired but... Really? You're tired? - Gosh. - It's hard at school. That's how it goes. You're going to eat something you like, I'm sure. Maybe. But you're ok? Yes. I'm fine. What's that? Happy birthday, our beloved mommy. That's so sweet. - Thanks, kitten. - Happy birthday. Blow them out? Yes, I'll blow them out. I'm really pleased you're here today. We're pleased to be here too, mom. No, I'm really pleased you could make it, and that you're both here with me today. Just a drop for me. - You see... - Come to the table, sweetie. I wanted to tell you... something that's very important for me. I wanted to say I love you. I'm proud of all three of you. I'm really proud to have all three of you here with me. Cheers. Cheers, mom. Théo, come to the table, I said. Don't play with that. Don't, dammit! What's with talking like that? It really doesn't matter, Frédéric. For you. That clock matters to me. Take it if you want. Are you kidding? Don't give him dad's clock. You'd like it, too? That's irrelevant. He shouldn't help himself. I really don't care about the clock. Or anything else of dad's. You couldn't wait for him to croak. Fred, cut the crap or get out. Mom, don't think about it. I'll talk to Fred. Don't think about it. Evening, Mrs. Dorn. After you. Go ahead. I can wait. - You're sure? - Yes. Or I'll stink you out. Thanks. Mom, Thursday at the salon. - Goodbye, Mrs. Dorn. - Goodbye. Well? They agreed. I knew you could do it. I knew it. Nina? In here. What's all that money? Money for our trip. Where did you get it? I sold the clock. Which clock? The ugly one on the dresser. Can you answer that, sweetie? She's busy. Who is it? Who's calling, please? Mr. Brémont. Yes, hello, Mr. Brémont. No, I haven't had time. Yes, I know... It's a bit tricky right now. I need some time before I decide. I don't know what to say. I'm not sure I'm interested. Granny! What? The ball fell in the water. Can you help me, please? I'll be outside. Smoking. Anyone here? Hello, Mr. Brémont. So... It turns out you're... not selling the apartment. Mr. Brémont tells me you're no longer interested. Isn't that what she said? She's not interested. Yes but... You didn't tell your children. You didn't dare? Right? It's my son, Frédéric. I'm nobody's fool. I tried telling him. Always the same old excuse. - Always the same old excuse! - I told you, I tried. Stop! Stop! Nina... Do you have a problem with old dykes? Excuse me? Dykes? Lezzies? Lesbians? You have a problem with them? Of course not. You see, Mado? Do you see, Mado? Nobody gives a damn! You're pathetic. What's that smell? Stand back, ma'am. Do you need help? No, thank you. I'm just tired. - Are you sure? - Yes. Thank you. Mrs. Dorn? Still here? I wanted to know how she is. They're not saying much. She had a stroke. They'll keep her in intensive care tonight. You can go home now. Thanks for being there and calling an ambulance. You look exhausted. Go to bed now. It's late. Can I call you a cab? No, thanks. Goodnight. Stable? What does "stable" mean? Look, that's all I know, Fred. I'll do the closet, you take the dresser. Like that, ok? No, more underwear. All she has is a hospital smock. That's enough, right? Get her toothbrush too. Which one of the two? No idea. Take both. A towel too. This all right? Fred! You can see they're beach towels. Here. That should do it. Don't you think that's too many? We don't know how long she'll stay. You think we'll bring her home? I don't know. They said to expect long-term effects. She might not speak again. Good evening. Good evening. Mrs. Girard is back home? Yes, I'm her caregiver. You're a friend of hers? Yes. I'm Nina, I live opposite. Can I see her? It's just that it's already 8 pm. Mrs. Girard is only just out of the hospital. Yes. - You stay overnight? - Of course. - What's your name? - Muriel. Please, just for... two minutes? Sorry, I just put her to bed. Come back tomorrow morning. Yes, of course. Goodnight. Mado, look at me. Here I am. Forgive me. For what I said. It wasn't true. I didn't mean it. Morning, Muriel. I brought croissants. Thanks. You said to come back this morning. Yes, of course. Come in, please. - You take no risks. - I heard strange noises last night. It's a noisy, old building. You'll get used to it. Hardly reassuring, with all the burglaries around here. Yes, it's awful. Mrs. Girard? Your neighbor's here to see you. Please, take a seat. - A cup of tea? - Yes, please. Madeleine? She can't speak, I'm sorry. Her children told me. But she understands? I'm not sure. So you'll be living here? Yes. To begin with, at least. If you ever need help, knock on my door. I can sit with Mrs. Girard when you go shopping. Her daughter will help me every morning. But it's very kind. Mrs. Girard and I are friends. It's absolutely no bother. I've been doing this over 20 years. I'm used to it, but I'll keep it in mind. The wheelchair's only for now? Yes, she should gradually regain mobility. We could go for a stroll. It's windy out. Tomorrow. Hello, you're taking her to the park? No, I'm going to the store. I can look after her while you're gone. Thanks, it's just downstairs. I mean, I'm here. Really, don't put yourself out. It's a little excursion for her. You're right. - I'll just dress and come with you. - Sorry, I must rush. I understand. Have a good day. Who's there? Muriel, it's me. Your mother's nearly ready. I bumped into Mrs. Dorn. You've met? - Please... - Yes, of course. You watered the plants? No, sorry. How does she seem to you, Muriel? Agitated at night. It's good if she's moving. Isn't it a good sign? It's dangerous for her heart, if she tires herself out. Perhaps you could avoid taking her to the store with you. Just to the grocery, so she's not alone. I told you, leave her with me when you need to go out. Really? That's very kind of you. No problem. Let me help. Come on, mom. Let's go now. Good, mom. That's great. Careful. That's right. Can you take her to rehab next Wednesday? I can't do it. Trouble is, my car's broken down. That's annoying. You assured me you had transport. It's only temporary. Take my mother's, but be careful. Yes, of course. - I'll leave the keys in the hall. - All right. I asked you quite specifically and you said yes. I said, be careful with the car, and look... When we got back, it was just fine. It's unacceptable... We'll talk later. There. You don't remember? It's us. Hold on... Look, Mado. It's where we met. It's Rome. It's Rome. Hold on... Nice and easy. Nice and easy does it. You walked. On your own. What are you doing here? I'm here for Madeleine. You shouldn't be here. It's you who shouldn't be here. She needs me with her. You understand? From now on, I'll be here every day. Her daughter nearly fired me over the car. I cannot afford to lose this job. Muriel, you won't lose a thing. That's not what I want. We can strike a deal. Keep me out of this. You let me look after her. And you'll be paid for a job you don't do. It's in your interest. If you want, we can go on as before. I need to pay for the repairs to Mrs. Girard's car. I'll cover it. How much do you need? 300 euros. All right. Every month. Very well. Madeleine needs some rest now. I'll be back tomorrow with the money. Is Mrs. Girard with you? Why? No. She's gone. What do you mean, gone? She's disappeared. When I came out of the shower, the door was open. - You didn't lock it? - Don't blame me. You shook her up yesterday. Come on. We'll split up here. There you are. Her daughter's here. She's waiting in her car, not far. I'm so sorry. I don't understand how it happened. When did you realize? She went for a shower and left the front door open and... Madeleine walked out. You left the front door open? Perhaps. Did you leave it open or not? I'm not sure. Yes, speaking. Where? Someone spotted her looking lost. - Thank you. - No problem. Are you ok? I was so worried. Thanks again for being there. No worries. Listen to this, Mado. It happened where I'm from. "Caught at Berlin airport "with her husband's intestines in her bags. "She refused to be separated from the love of her life." I'm a romantic, but that's going a bit far. Evening, Nina. Evening. You're back already? Yes. How was she today? Same as usual. You remember the cat I mentioned? This is Bart. The only one left. I thought he'd keep you company. Like him? Yes, he's cute. I get the feeling your mother isn't so good as before. Yes, I know. After the other day, they upped the dose of beta-blockers. To keep her blood pressure under control. You think that's a good idea? We followed the doctor's advice. I'm not sure. When I see her like this... Well, I'll be going. Stay for dinner. I'm alone. Théo's with his father. - I won't bother you. - Don't be silly. And I'll show you how to handle Bart. You've done so much these last few days. Your mother and I are friends. She did so much for me when I moved here. How long have you lived in France? Let's say it's a long time since I left Berlin. I lived here and there. How come? I was a tour guide, mostly in big cities. You must have seen so much. Yes. I also like the peace and quiet here. It's funny, though, choosing to retire here. Generally, people head for the Riviera. Yes. But I love it here. I was looking for something in the area. Three years ago, I came across my apartment. It had been empty so long I got it at a knockdown price. There we go. You don't like living here? It's not that. I'd never move away. But not everybody's like me. I think my mother wished she'd moved. What makes you say that? We were always very close, the two of us. I know she wanted to travel, wanted to... leave this town. She sacrificed herself for her family. It's not always the best thing to do. My ex-husband would agree with you. You never married? No. My father tyrannized my mother. But she stayed. She never left. It's beautiful in one way. I wish someone loved me like that. Mom never tried to start over after his death. He was her only true love. Mom, look at the soldiers on the photo. Sorry, kitten? Look at the soldiers. What's that? That's the Colosseum in Rome. And there is Granny. So young. About the same age as me there. Funny, that could be Mrs. Dorn. - What? There? - Yes, there. I'm coming! Madeleine! What are you doing? I don't understand what's going on. Perhaps it's her medication. Madeleine, look. Your daughter's here. - You need help? - No, thanks, it's fine. - You're sure? - Positive. What are you doing? Stop that, mom. Stop. Stop that. What are you doing? Give me that. No, stop. Give me that! Mom! What are you doing? Get out. Get out! Same again. No more tonight. We're closed. Pain in the ass. Pain in the ass. What on earth are you doing? Hello. The owner told us to change the locks. You can't just walk in. I understand, yes. Goodbye. Anne... You can't keep ignoring me like this. Call me back, please. My number is 06 23 22 20 72. Thank you. Ma'am, open up, please. We just came to talk. Thank you for opening up. This is awkward, right. - My mother lost her job. - I know. - It's very unfortunate. - Yeah, right. Mom, leave this to me. She said you had a deal. You agreed to pay her a certain sum for... You know, the favor she did you. The favor she did me? Is this a joke? We wouldn't be here if you'd left her patient alone. Hand over the money, period. Who do you think you are? I told you she'd try to cross us. Do what we say or you'll regret it. Go fuck yourselves. This isn't an end to this. Who do you think you are? You won't get rid of me so easily. Is it normal for her to be asleep? Yes, she must be tired, that's all. Want to stay for dinner with us? Yes. The hospice was a bad idea. It's best for her. - We take her home. - No. - Hire a new caregiver. - No way. Face it, she's unhappy. You don't get it. She cannot go back home. Anne, are you ok? What's wrong? What do you want now? - I must talk to you. - There's nothing to say. I've got this. - Go away. - I just want to explain how things are. - Haven't you done enough? - Let me in. You need to know. Your mother wanted to move away with me. She never loved your father, she couldn't bear him. She lied to you for the last 20 years. I'm her true love. Go away. You're dimwits. Go or I'll call the police. You're thinking of her? Morning, Mrs. Girard. How are you today? It seems worse and worse. There are ups and downs in these cases. - What's all that? - Her new medication. I never agreed to new medication. I'm just following instructions. She's been unstable recently. That's how you solve the issue? By drugging them up until they obey. I'm just doing my job. 59. 89. - 47. - Not playing? Come on... They called number 47. 7. 17. 9. 32. Sorry, this is Bellecroix Retirement Home. No, no problem. A patient called you by mistake. Hold on. Which home did you say? - You're a relation? - No. I'm an old friend. Her daughter's here too. If you want a word, she's with the director. It's the best we can do to restore her calm. Her blood pressure was worryingly high. Your mother's situation is difficult to live with. But you cannot interrupt a course of treatment. This protocol is standard procedure. And perfectly suited to your mother. We should have talked you through it. I apologize. I promise you she's getting the best possible care. Do you understand? Yes, of course. Come on, Mado. Quickly! You need to change. You can't stay like that. We don't need much. We take the money. And clothes. All the rest can wait till Italy. How did you get there? I know you're in there. I saw you leaving, and the car outside. Don't do anything stupid, please. I'm sorry. Mom, please. Mom, I'm here. We can talk. We can talk now. Open up. I didn't realize. Mom! Nina. Open the door. Mom! You'll live with me On a fantastic island And you'll see a world up there A world concealed in blue A brand new world for you The Earth, the Earth... Will have no borders The Earth, the Earth... The moon will bring us good luck It will be our future If you love me, if you love me...
