{\a6}Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad Spring 1999 Episode 1 You little rascals. This one never studies and gets into fights. What does your father do? He's a cop. Cop? Good going, you little wastrel. Your father goes around chasing after criminals and robbers so that you can get an education. He's toiling away but all you can do is hit your friend at school, you delinquent. Stand there and raise your arms. What does your father do? He's a chaebol* (*tycoon/conglomerate) Chaebol? Oh... chaebol. Yes. If your father's a chaebol, my father's the president. It's the truth. I'm being serious too, you delinquent! Do you have proof? Proof? This is proof that my father's chaebol. It's not true. He's a total liar. He doesn't even have a father and rents a room with his mom at Kang Woo's. He's piss poor, so he goes around lying that his dad is chaebol. Kang Woo, stand up. Yes, Teacher. What do you think? Is his father really chaebol? I'm pretty sure that Seok Bong's father is chaebol. It's just that Seok Bok's father doesn't know about him yet. That's why they are renting a room at our house. But once Seok Bok finds his dad, his luck will change. I know it. Teacher, aren't you curious to know why I have this charm? I am a little curious. A little? No, a lot. Then should I tell you? OK. Oppa, you look good today. You're prettier. {\a6}{Mom] {\a6}{Ex-boyfriend] Soo Ryun. Did you forget that it was my birthday today? You don't have to put on such a scared face. I didn't come here to make a big scene in front of a guy who's leaving because he doesn't like me. You wanna blow it out together? Why are you doing this? Don't do it if you don't want to. Now, get the hell out of here, you dirty bastard! Oppa! Who's that woman? {\a6}{Chaebol] My passport. You're sitting on something of mine. Does this airport belong to you? Excuse me? Fine. Even if this whole airport is yours, don't bother me today. Cuz I'm seconds from having a breakdown. I'm just saying that you're... If you want someone to talk to, go find someone else! It's not that... That good for nothing bastard! And YOU! Why did you talk to me when I told you not to bother me! Now I'm crying because of you! I don't even have a tissue... what am I gonna do? Here you go. Why does this feel so good? I shouldn't have blown my noise into this. Why did you give me something so expensive? It's fine. That's fine, so... I don't want to wash it and return it to you. So here. Since you've given this to me... how about this also... What do you think you're looking at! Having one bastard in my life is plenty. You live your life earnestly! Excuse me! It really is my birthday. How can things like this happen to me all day long? - Dealing with two damn bastards in one day. - Excuse me! What, you still haven't come to your senses, you pervert! Why don't you try insisting that you were touching your own butt! Look, Miss! My ticket was stuck to your butt and now it flew away! What do you mean my butt... Do you want to have a drink somewhere? My aching head... Did you sleep well? We didn't just have a drink? No. Did I have something expensive to drink? Like liquor? Yes. 30 year old shiraz... Oh no... I can't control myself when I have liquor... I attacked you, right? It's OK. I didn't mind. Crazy! I'm crazy! With a man I met for the first time! Stop it. - Let go of me. - Get up for a second. Why the heck am I so easy? There has been a massive crash report for Flight #447 from Seoul to New York. The bodies of 92 Koreans, 23 foreigners, and 9 crew members have all been located. {\a6}{Airline crash - no survivals] The plane that has been located in the US is currently under investigation. Thank you very much. It's such a relief that I didn't get on that plane because of you. If I had gotten on the plane as planned, I wouldn't be here right now. It's scary just thinking about it. If you feel bad because of last night, don't be like that. It looks like the heavens caused our accident last night, so that I could avoid the other accident. It seems like our destinies are intertwined. So let's acknowledge that last night was a gift from the heavens and accept it as a precious gift. Here, take this. This is the most important thing to me in this world. And I want to give it to my life's savior. President. What? I'm sorry. Wait! Something urgent came up. I have to go overseas on a business trip. I'll be gone for about a week. Please call me. You're gonna call, right? President. Do you know that man? He's a part of the royal family. Royal family? What's that? He's from a chaebol family. Chaebol? You can check this out for 15 days. - Yes. Good bye. You're gonna call, right? Grandmother, are you all right? How far are you going? To the bus stop. I'll take you there. So you're saying... That by the time she got back to the payphone, that book was gone. Is that right? How can she lose that book? It's like she kicked a luxury car that was being offered to her. That is my mom's biggest mistake and my life's biggest tragedy. But I won't become the lead character to a tragedy. My life might be like this right now because of that book. But I still have this piece of evidence that my father gave me. Good, good. You have the right attitude. Seok Bong, you have to find your father. And when you do, don't forget to give him my best. All right. Then can I...? Yes. Go sit down. Sit. Teacher, how about me? You. Stay there with your arms up. Go, sit. Why should I be the only one standing? It's not fair! He says his father is chaebol. His father's chaebol! Global leaders of tomorrow. You need to make your company into a train filled with energy. {\a6}Global Leader's Workshop It's now time to inspect the affirmative energy level of your company's "train" {\a6}Is your company succeeding? {\a6}The entrepreneur?s "Energy Train" Talks of bankruptcy bring in negative energy into a business. Negative energy is like a cancer that eats away at the affirmative energy necessary for a company. Whoever is creating that negative energy needs to be ignored. You need to tell them to get off the train immediately! Do you think that's necessary? I'm sorry for the interruption, but I'll say a few words. Just as he does in his book, the esteemed Kang Hyun Jung talked about the mighty power of affirmation. Therefore, you need to ignore anything that's negative. That's what you mean, right? So, that would mean that you can't get upset when you're stuck in traffic during rush. If you're going to be stuck in traffic, learn to enjoy that time. Listen to the radio or music, or talk to your lover on the phone. But this is the kind of thought I have... It sucks to be stuck in traffic. There are big problems with the roads of this nation. Not only do I get annoyed, but I feel the need to do something in order to make things better. This means that the power to change the nation's traffic problems may derived from negativity, not affirmation. Negativity isn't the cancer that eats away at the power of affirmation. I believe that it possesses the power to surpass the ability of affirmation in your life. If you find anything negative in my words, please let me know without hesitation. I'm sure that your thoughts will help me to be matured into someone better. I'm sorry. I'm sure you think of me as a cancer and you'd want to throw me off this train. I'll go now. Hold on. Which company are you from? I want to find out also. Since it came up, can everyone take a look at my necklace? You saw the tall guy that just walked passed us, right? Find out who he is. Yes. {\a6}Even if you're born as a different person in a different world, {\a6}all I need is you {\a6}Only you, as you are {\a6}You're the only one whom I need next to me {\a6}Even if I suffer to the point of defeat, {\a6}all I need is you by my side {\a6}I won't be afraid of anything else {\a6}if you're the one with me He's back! Oh great. You saw, right? Didn't I say that he would come back safely without getting caught? Hand it over. Everyone, hand it over quickly. - Here, take it and shove it up your butt. - Hey, how about you? What? Give it to me. Why are you the one excited? Seok Bong is my "bong" (peak). Seok Bong is my "bong". When he finds his dad... That crazy little bastard. Hey, room 9129 is causing havoc because they haven't received their dry cleaning yet. Your dry cleaning is here. We took some time to get rid of the dry clean smell. Thank you. You must have a date. Why don't you try a pocket square? A pocket square is like a man's flag. It's raising up his country. A white handkerchief symbolizes a land of utopia. I think the white will give off a romantic air against your black suit. Where did you learn something like that? It's special service from the hotel. Let's see... Which chaebols are in the luxury suites today. {\a6}{Incoming call: bulldog] Where this jerk go this time? Han Yoo Dong, did you see Empty Bong*? {\a6}(*Seok Bong's nickname) - Dong Min is looking for him also. - What? I'll tell you if you give me 10,000 won. I'll give you 20,000 to bite off your neck. Looks like you lost money again from a bet. I thought you had to save as much as possible for your sibling's hospital bill. Why can't you catch him? If you could catch him in the act, I wouldn't have lost any money. Right? What? What nonsense are you spewing? We are our own shadow. We are our own shadow. We are our own shadow. We are our own shadow. We are invisible. We are invisible. Your voices are softer than mine. We are invisible. We are invisible! Hey you little slimy worm, why aren't you repeating after me? Because I'm not a shadow or the invisible man. Then what are you? Chaebol's son. No chaebol is claiming you as their son. Why do you insist that you're a chaebol's son? If it hurts, yell. I won't yell even if it hurts. I'll behave as a chaebol should. Fine, why don't you do that? What should you guys be doing? As though you're not present, non existent. Be the customer's shadow, their avatar. All for the customer's comfort. Attitude of service. That's your duty. My final stage that's sure to elicit a scream. Vicious little worm. I know that you slimed your way out of work in the afternoon. I'll be watching to see how long you keep this up. Keep watching. You worm, wait until I step on your tail. I won't get caught. Pull together an inventory report for the check-ins. For every single suite. The bulldog's coming on strong so be extra careful. If you let down your guard, you're sure to get caught. He'll be the one who's sorry for stepping on a chaebol's son. Why do you think I keep working here under that jerk? Because all of Korea's chaebol meet here. I'm sure my father will come here one day also. Once he sees this, it's all over. I didn't come here to work. I came to find my father. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for bothering you on your vacation. Team leader, why do you get paid? If you can't handle the work, then resign. It was a difficult situation. Is that your excuse? Are you going to kill someone and then say that it was a difficult situation? That's... Forget the excuses. How about what I asked you to prepare? {\a6}{Union Strike] Why is it so noisy here? If you act like this, do you think you'll get something in return? Who are you? Oh Sung Group's Director of Mergers and Acquisitions, Lee Shin Mi. Lee Shin Mi? Lee Shin Mi? Back off! Back off! Take a look at this. Even if you acquire the company, here's the petition with the workers who refuse to work for you. Are you the president? That's right. I'm the president. Do you have to be the president? If you're the president, the company will be ruined. Why do you keep insisting that you have to be the president? It's not due to my wishes, but the desire of the employees. Don't make me laugh. No matter how much you want to be president, do you have to sell out your employees? How hideous of you. What? What's this? Shall I go back? If you want me to, I can go back. But who'll pay your salary then? Your company was in the red by 200,000,000 won by last year. A debt close to 10 billion won means that you're at the brink of bankruptcy. If I leave right now, your company will be in ruins with a whole load of debt. Do you all want to perish? Mr. Choi Ho Sung. Mr. Kim Jung Soon. Lee Ho Nil. Jo Eun Sang. Lee Jae Hyung. Jo Eun Sang. Here. Gil Dae Chang. Jung Hyung Eun. I'll keep it short. I came to give you the opportunity to be an Oh Sung employee. You are now being resurrected from a debt-filled employee to Korea's best, an employee of Oh Sung. Don't fall for it. This woman is using you. Do you want to just follow along blindly? You can't trust this woman. Once they takeover, they'll fire the employees first. They'll fire you guys first. This is something that I cherish the most in the world. I'll make a promise to you with my precious hair in my hands. If you trust me, I'll trust you too. If you work hard and we see an improvement, I won't fire you. I promise. Now, if you want to work hard under Oh Sung, please stand behind me. Why are you just dawdling? Don't you want to get paid? Goodness. What should we do? You guys can't do this to me. You don't have a lot of time. In the next minute... No, it's not a good morning. I'll call out today's VIP room assignments. Seol In Construction President Wang, Lee Kwang Hyun. Manager Director of Jeon Jin Shipping, Yoo Dong Min. It looks like he's not in a very good mood this morning. He's seconds away from bursting. And all of you already know but Director Lee Shin Mi will be using the suite room from today. Our peaceful existence is now over. Our time of doom is here. Since it's unavoidable, let's just embrace our doom. All right, who'll do us the honor and take on the suite room. Fine. I'll pay a bonus. Extra 50% in bonus. An extra 70%. Fine, my hidden card. Don't be shocked. 100% extra! Is this how you're gonna be? Can you call yourself a hotelier? Kang Woo, you do it. No. I'd rather die. Fine. Go die. Han Yoo Dong. Do it for your brother. No. I have to survive in order to take care of my brother. I can't put myself in danger. I'd rather resign. Then resign. Resign, you jerk! Are you bastards gonna be like this? I'll do it. Seok Bong. I gave you fair warning. If you don't pay rent, I'm going to kick you out of the attic room. You said you'll tack on an extra 100%. Since you're adding on, how about another 20%? 120% extra. What? Forget it if you don't want to. I didn't say that. But you can't back out later. Captain, you just keep your word. Are you crazy? Captain. he's lost his mind because he wasn't able to eat kalbi this morning. Even if she's difficult, how difficult can she be? You'll get hurt with that attitude. The kid that was in charge of her room last year was institutionalized from a nervous breakdown. Now for the one who's put down a royal decree, for our Slimy Worm, Empty Bong... Let's give him a round of applause. Applause! Again! You made a good decision. I'm proud of you. I told you to keep clapping! If you were going to cut your hair... Do you think I wanted to cut my hair? I needed to show something to the people who had no plans on trusting me. Then you could have just worn a wig... So small minded... then there's no authenticity. And do you know how expensive a wig is? It's not that expensive. This is from a department store, and with a 5% coupon... It's still more expensive than Namdaemun (street market). Director, I'm going to put in gas. Hold on. Use the points on this for gas. And use this free coupon for the car wash instead of using cash. Hold on! Try this. - Good bye! - Excuse me. This is our moisture pack. Please try it. Give me one more. Let's go. Han So Jung, don't hit the brakes so hard. It wastes gas. When are you going to fix that gas guzzling habit of yours? Welcome, Ahgassi. Do I run a gang? Go work instead of standing here in line. I pay you to work, not to stand in line. He's going to be in charge of your room. How much more are you getting? How much extra did you agree to receive for taking care of me? There isn't anything like that. Fire him. Excuse me? He's not one to do this kind of work. His back is too straight. He won't bend his back to serve others. I'm sorry, Ahgassi. The room assignments have already been completed, so there's no one else who can handle your room. Then fire him once I leave. Is this the only luggage? Yes. Is something wrong? No. The other chaebol ahgassis who come here usually have more luggage. It's like they've moved in. Why? Are you vexed because there's only one bag? No. There's no need for that. Just pick it up. I'm sorry. It's just a habit. You can go. Is there anything else you need? No. You can go. Then, is there something you've forgotten? Are you... Are you hoping for a tip? If that's the case, you can forget it. I didn't forget. I don't have any intentions of giving you tip. Don't expect a tip from me. Why? Because I don't want to. Now there's no reason for you to dawdle. Get out. Is she really a chaebol daughter? How does it make sense that she spends big bucks staying in the Royal Suite, but refuses to give a measly tip to save money? Of course it makes sense. The Royal Suite is usually empty because it's expensive. She only stays there because she doesn't want to see it go to waste. And she's not giving tip for the same reason. Then why was she born as a chaebol daughter? She should have been born as the 9th daughter of an attic-room family. That's what I'm saying. She really is a vicious girl. She may be a chaebol but she always goes Dutch. Her bag is filled with makeup samples. She tries to use credit card points and free coupons as much as possible. And she can't stand seeing the light on anywhere. Who turned on these lights when there's plenty of sunlight here! We're throwing away money. Turn it off immediately. There isn't an area where we're trying to save money. We're trying our best. Stop right there. What's the problem? Are you going to drive around the cleaner all day long? Going around twice should be plenty. Why do you keep cleaning the same spot continuously? Don't you know we're trying to save electricity? Would you do the same thing if you were given a mop? Please bring a mop. Excuse me? Hurry up. I want to see if she'll clean it 5-6x with a mop also. You really got suckered into it. What do you suckered in? He volunteered himself. That's right. I volunteered myself so I have to do it well. What? Since we're dealing with a chaebol daughter, it's only right that a chaebol son gets involved. All right. Go for it. If you get a tip from that woman, I'll acknowledge that you're a chaebol son. Whether you acknowledge it or not, I'm a chaebol son. Of course. The heavens and the earth know. Looks like only your father doesn't know. Wherever that chaebol father of yours may be. That... Bong, why don't you... I won't give up. Whatever happens, I'm going to get a tip from that woman. Choi Seok Bong, can I borrow your comb? Hey. You probably don't know because you're new here. Bong may lend out his underwear but he never let's anyone use his comb. He hates mixing his hair with other people's hair and dandruff. With his lot in life... What do you mean his lot? To a chaebol son. Where are you going? To get my tip. Look at this. Flushing money down the drain. Check the CCTV and hunt down the person who left the water running. Huh? Give them a warning. If they do this one more time, they'll be cut. Yes. I'll give a warning. - Will they do this at their own house? - Treating people like it's her hair. What did you just say? Yes? That you did a good job of cutting your hair. Really? Did I do that good of a job? Wait. You just insulted me, right? No. It was a compliment. It seemed like an insult. It was a compliment. Don't go around complimenting me anymore. I'm getting a headache trying to figure out if it's a compliment or an insult. The thing I hate the most in the world is wasting money. Keep an eye out and make sure that we're not throwing money away. If you don't, you can get fired at any time. Why did it cost so much to get a haircut? I should have gone somewhere else. Why is that light on again? Do you want to get rich? Do you want to be a chaebol? I'll share with you the secret that only 1% of the country knows. How to get rich. That secret is right in front of your eyes. Just open your hands and grab it. Grab it? How can you grab onto horseshit? Where are we? This is where the top 1% of our nation gather: Oh Sung Hotel. The place is overflowing in every direction with the successful. This is where they interact and stay. Now, open your eyes. Keep an eye on who they're with, what they're doing, what they're thinking, what they're interested in. Find out what they want to do and what they refuse to do. Don't miss anything and keep track of every detail. Is he crazy? Am I crazy? OK. That's right. You have to be crazy. In order to be rich, you have to be crazy. In order to be rich, you have to live like the rich. Why aren't you guys clapping? Applause! Then, should we use the intermission to live like the rich? Now, close your eyes for a moment. And try to imagine yourself as a rich person. Aren't you happy just to imagine it? Becoming rich means that you can have everything that you'd like. Luxury brand shopping. Foreign cars. First class ticket. And a sweet glass of wine. How ridiculous. What crazy bastards. Have you seen a cheater be successful? If cheating makes a person rich, then Korea would be filled with rich folks. How does a person like that even exist? Ahjussi. You're here? You called about the book. Yes. One came in yesterday. Hold on. Here it is. Connect the dots looking forward when I was in college, It was very very clear, looking back 10 years later. Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking back. {\a6}{A letter of commendation: Best Investor, Choi Seok Bong] {\a6}{The 10th Annual University Stock Investment Contest: First place] So you have to trust that the dots will connect somehow in the future. You have to trust in something: God, destiny, life, karma, whatever. {\a6}{Oh Sung Group President Lee Joong Hun gives to low-income disabled families] Sometimes, life hits you in the head like a brick. Don't lose faith. If you live each day as though it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right. Stay hungry. Stay foolish. Stay hungry. Stay foolish! {\a6}It was difficult. {\a6}It would have been easier to die. {\a6}There was no such thing as hope in my heart {\a6}'Till the day you came into my life {\a6}It's okay that I'm alone {\a6}cuz I have the world in my hands {\a6}It's okay that I'm lonely {\a6}Cuz my heart is filled to the brim with my path Bring me a t-shirt. {\a6}It's okay that things are hard {\a6}Cuz you're standing where I can see you {\a6}So close that I can reach out my hands to you silently {\a6}and be able to touch you What are you doing right now? I asked what you're doing in my room right now. No, I just brought up the dry cleaning. That's just an excuse, right? Excuse me? You want to buy stocks there? And make some money? Are you a thief? Insider trading is a crime also. Did you come in here for something like this? I think there must be a misunderstanding. Misunderstanding? The truth is what you see with your own eyes. I know people like you well. People who would do anything when they get a whiff of money in front of their nose. Trying to pry out rich people's secret, not realizing their own lot in life. Attacking head on without a second thought. Trying to pick up anything that a rich person leaves around. Are you finished? Didn't you come in here like a thief to latch onto anything you find? Get out. A thief like you. You're fired. - Let go of me! - Follow me. Excuse, please let go. Let go of me. If I let go, I'll get fired. If anyone gets fired, It'll be me. Hey, let go of me. Stop being an ass. Are you in your right mind? Do you think you can do whatever you want? Look here, you chaebol daughter. You called me a thief? You think I'm the kind of guy that would steal your stock tips. Stop acting so high and mighty. You want to buy this stock? If you buy stocks here, you'll lose everything. Why would you buy stocks from a company that'll go under in 6 months? Do you think I'm crazy? You marked it for that reason also! You chaebol daughter, don't live life like that. How can you be the director of one of the largest companies when you can't read people at all. Instead of pulling down the company, Why don't you get married and take care of a husband. What? You... really... You want to fire me? Fire me. Try and fire me. I'm so sorry. Empty Bong, I mean Choi Seok Bong. I'll fire him immediately. Forget it. Excuse me? Since I'm the one who was in the wrong. I can't just fire him because I'm in a bad mood. That's true. Then I won't fire him. Still, fire him. Huh? Not now, but later. If he does anything even remotely wrong, report it to me. I'll fire him without even a hint of pity. But you can't give him a hard time or anything. I hate stuff like that. Oh! The pool's windows were a bit grimy. I'll call a part timer immediately and have it cleaned. Does money grow on trees? Why would you use a part timer? It's perfect. Make the person in charge of my room clean it. Is something wrong? No, there's nothing wrong. How can you be the director of one of the largest companies when you can't read people at all. Instead of pulling down the company, why don't you get married and take care of a husband. Hey. Why? Come here and hand me my juice. I'm thirsty. Why don't you just do it yourself? You just have to reach out your hand. My hands are busy. What are you gonna do? Are you going to beat me with that thing? If you're not going to beat me up, then give me my juice. I said I'm thirsty. It's shaking. Hold it right. That's good. Why aren't you leaving? You're not waiting for a tip, right? I am waiting for a tip. Please give me a tip. No. Give it to me. You do have a thief's attitude. It should be enough to get paid extra to take care of me. What more do you want? How did you... I got it. Huh? I got it right by guessing. That's that and a tip's a tip. Stop staring at... My money. Hurry up and get that. Who me? Go and get that out. You're telling me to go in the water to scoop that out? Then should I throw it away? My hard earned money? Hurry up and get it out. The person wearing the swimsuit should be the one going into the pool. I don't go into the pool unless I'm swimming. Go get it. Fine. I'll go get it but give it to me as tip. No. Give me. Go get the captain. I'll do it. Take it off. I said take it off. If you ruin the uniform because of a personal accident, it'll cost you 10,000 won. You're going to foolishly throw away 10,000 won to pick up 500 won? I told you. Whether it's my own or someone else's, seeing people waste money makes me sick. Seeing you makes me sick. You just insulted me in your head right? At least he does that right. Hey, hey. Hey! You! Give me. Give it to me as tip. I told you that I wouldn't. Then I'll stay under water until you give it to me. You're willing to risk your life for a tip. I'm risking my life for my pride. I need to get a tip from you. Should I go back inside? Fine, even if you get a tip, it'll come from me. So give me that coin. Hey, why are you leaving? Ahh... tip? Hey you! Look here! Hey what's wrong? Did something happen? Huh? What's wrong? Be quiet so I can watch the news. {\a6}{President's Meeting with Entrepreneurs] The president took out time to meet with... Wow, he's something else Frontier Group's Chu Woon Seok. Nickname, Prince of the Financial World. Charisma, looks, and talents. He's the kind of real royalty that women are looking for. Women must flock to him like birds. Father. Bingo! Even when I look at him, he's really attractive. I'm jealous. Seok Bong, only if you had met your chaebol father. I'm going to meet him. Huh? Of course, you have to meet him. You sure have to meet him. Slimy worm, what are you doing here? If you guys keep taking a break from work, I'll let you take a break forever. Hey, hey. Stop getting mad. And while you're here, have some of this. They say that it's good for your stamina. Are you trying to make fun of me? How do you think this will help me? I'm already overflowing with energy every night that I'm tempted to return to my previous cell. Slimy Worm, you got a physical when all the hotel employees were getting their check-ups. Right? Yes. Why? You received a notice of protest, that's why. You created some sort of ruckus, didn't you. Why can't you just live quietly. How can you take back something you already offered me? Give it to me. I heard in an interview that you plan on taking Frontier Group to the top 10 stock listing. And that it's your dream to become the top ranking company's president. Yes, that's right. I'm sure that's every entrepreneur?s dream. Do you have any special tactics? By chance, do you like tennis? - Tennis? - Yes. If you think about it, an entrepreneur is like a tennis player. A lazy tennis player who doesn't practice everyday will end up having to quit the tour. They practice everyday because they know this better than anyone else. Yes, I see. Thank you for taking time out for the interview. - You did well. - No problem. Good job everyone. Good job. But... don't you need a partner for tennis? Why are you worried about a partner? What are you doing right now? What do you think? I'm letting you know that not everyone can date my Oppa. You still aren't leaving? Tae Hee. Congratulations on completing the important business deal. Oh, OK. Thanks. But... I have something to ask first. It looks like you weren't too busy to meet women. Who is this woman? A special woman. What? A special woman? I'm not believing what I'm hearing. Believe it. You heard correctly. Then who am I? You are... my special dongsaeng (younger sister). Special dongsaeng. I decline. I didn't follow you around all this time just to be your dongsaeng. Just like you call me oppa, you're just a pretty dongsaeng to me. Mr. Chu Woon Seok, listen carefully. Even though I'm not your special woman right now... I'll let it go for now. Since I'll one day be the woman whom you choose. Tae Hee... That's what will happen. Because Bu Tae Hee has already chosen you. The man I've chosen will end up choosing me. Good bye, Woon Seok. Find out immediately who's the bitch in that picture. Yes. We have a party for the American Consulate. It's a party where the top 1% of Korea will be attending. I'll kill anyone who makes a mistake. Anyone who makes a mistake will have to deal with this bulldog's teeth. Confirm the guest list and get working. Yes! {\a6}It was difficult {\a6}It would have been easier to die {\a6}There was no such thing as hope in my heart {\a6}'Till the day you came into my life {\a6}It's okay that I'm alone {\a6}cuz I have the world in my hands {\a6}It's okay that I'm lonely {\a6}Cuz my heart is filled to the brim with my path You haven't found the director yet? Yes. The party's about to start. Did she run away again? She's going to upset the attendees. Secretary Han, keep looking. - I'll keep looking also. - Yes. I found Director Lee Shin Mi. This is a public announcement. Where were you going? Don't worry about it. Were you, by chance, running away? Who's running away? Do you have a party phobia? Who do you think I am? I don't grow things like that. I don't grow things like that. I just don't like loud places. Even if you don't like it, don't show it. Even if you like it, don't show it. Controlling your mind and emotions. Isn't that the basics of a royal family? The director's party dress is ready, so please escort her to her room. Over. OK. Over! Director, how can you disappear so suddenly? Who said I disappeared? I just went out for some fresh air. She was about to disappear with the wind, but I brought her back. Then I'll be leaving. You can leave. Make it tighter. I don't think... You can... make it tighter... Did you find out? I did find out. But it would have been better if I didn't find out... Who is the bitch that's so special to Woon Seok... She's... Wow, you look so pretty. You like an angel who's come down from the sky. Quiet. I'm not going to raise your salary. Do I have to wear a wig when it hurts my head like this? You have to in order to make sure that your hair matches your dress... Do I have to go to stuff like this? The economy's bad enough. Why are there so many parties? You received an invite and it's at our hotel. Of course you have to attend. You have to at least show your face and greet some people... All right. I'm only going to say hello and leave. What are you doing here? There was a complaint that the light bulbs were out. Don't worry about me and clean as you need. I'll quickly replace these and leave. All right. You go first. What are you doing here? I'm using this as an excuse to come see you. You saw me. Why didn't you call? I said I wasn't going to. I waited for your call. If I say I won't, then I don't. Was it that shocking to kiss me?

Take a look at yourself. Shut your trap and just enjoy the party. Fine. I'll do that. If you can explain this. This is really putting me in a bad mood. YOU! Did you buy this? Is money a joke to you? You're foolish and thoughtless. It's embarrassing to be your sunbae. Look here, let go of me. Let go! Can't you see? I'm not the Slimy Worm who was cleaning the toilet the other day. Look at you, talking out of your butt again. Was it that important? Do you know how much Mom loved you? Yes, this is Choi Seok Bong. The results of the physical? I'm really dying?
