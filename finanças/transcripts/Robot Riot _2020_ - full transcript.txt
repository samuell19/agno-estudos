Where the fuck am I? Ah, God! Goddammit! What's your name? I don't know. I can't remember anything. What, it's not Shane? Yeah, I guess. Oh, God, do you got one of these things too? Yeah, what does it do? How the hell would I know? I can't remember my name. All I know, I woke up about five minutes ago, tangled up in a parachute with this fucking thing jammed in my neck and the next thing I know, a robot the size of King Kong is trying to kill me, okay? That's all I know. Thank you for that, by the way. Yeah. Where'd you get the artillery? Strapped to my pack. I know about as much as you do. So we're pretty much fucked. Let's scramble your gear so we can find a way out of this place. Oh my God. Hello? Oh, shit. C101, please come in. C101, do you copy? Initialize boot up sequence. C101 loading sequence. We read you loud and clear. We see here you're not fully intact. See what you can find nearby. Improvise with what you have. Copy that. Start up the Roamer program. Copy that. C101 will report in three hours. - Voice options execute. - Human voice one. - Human voice two. - Human voice three. You all right? Saw you over there. Figured you'd need some help. I found some food and I got a little extra water. Where are we? I don't know. What'd you find? Some kind of weapon. I don't fully know what it does. Did you see somebody run outta here just now? It was really weird. No. But welcome to hell. The headaches will last a least a day or so and they sent us in with hardly any food. They? Who's they? What's with the siren? They go off when they send in new recruits. Seems to be a couple times a day now. Most don't make it. I keep coming across mangled and chicken fried bodies. This doesn't make any sense. I mean, what is it, some kind of game? Yeah, it's a game. And you're losing. - Hey. - Oh fuck yeah. It's good? Oh, watch out, watch out. Okay, come on, let's go get him. Run! What the hell was your plan? I don't know, self defense? That was a rough landing. You okay? Yeah. Got one of those things too, huh? I'm Madison. Brock. Got about a week's worth of MREs in your pack, Brock. Maybe a day's worth of water. I'd say maybe 10 matches because most won't work. A utility knife and a machete to fight these things. From what I can tell, it's about six p.m. West is in that general direction. I think. Good luck. Wait, hold on, hey, hey. Wait, hold up, wait, I really think we should stick together Clearly, you're an ass. That brilliant move you pulled back there could get us both killed and I'm not interested in being target practice. Okay, but I, hey, hey! I really think that we should stick together. I don't. Well, you should at least give me your weapon and supplies. Holy shit. God, I hate this place. Some kind of barrier. Well, looks like you're stuck with me. Looks like it's us versus them. Wait, hold up. Looks like somebody was here before us. Bastard got what it deserved. All right, let's get outta here. We're way too exposed. Hey, there might be some food. Yeah. I'll go see what's around back. Piper? Bingo. Don't turn around. Put the can down. Throw your weapon over there. - Okay. - That's it. Look, we're on the same team here, all right? I'm Shane. I don't give a fuck who you are. You had to have seen the robots. Keep your hands up and your mouth shut. Give me your bag- Whoa! Shit! Found this outside in her pack. What the hell was that? What, did you want me to introduce myself first? Well, I mean, the more of us, the better, you know? She didn't really seem like the reasoning type. Hello? Now that we are all here, we can begin our little exercise. Do not be alarmed. Remember, you all volunteered for this little experiment. And as many of you have figured out by now, we are in the process of testing our new military equipment. The mech series, some of you were not as sharp. We need to find out what variables we are dealing with here. In this case, the human variable. We're guinea pigs. You have all been given the necessary tools to make this a fair fight. Your fate is dependent on your will to live. We are all pulling for you in this little exercise and of course, the government of the United States of America thanks you for your service. This is bullshit. They can't do this, can they? Can they? You heard the man. Let's show them what they're working with. Well, I think it's safe to say they're tracking our movements with these damn things in our neck. Probably monitoring our vitals as well. And I'm guessing if there's a perimeter, that we're not gonna have access to it. Well, you're finally starting to sound like a soldier, Shane. I don't feel like one. How many do you think are out there? We don't even know where there is. There might not be an end to this place. Oh no, no, there is always an end. I think our friend back there found out the hard way. Why do you think they needed to erase our memories? Well, knowledge is power. I mean, think about it, makes it a fair game, right? Robots without awareness versus humans without awareness. Maybe we don't want to remember. Maybe you killed a bunch of insurgents, maybe... Maybe I killed my husband. Well, it definitely seems to be, you know, within your skillset. Asshole. You just blew a stranger's head off and I'm an asshole? Okay. Okay. Well, why don't you just take a break, all right? I'll take the first watch. We should probably snuff this out, though. It's like a beacon. Oh shit, this can't be good. Shh. More humans. We're surrounded. Yeah, no shit. They're everywhere. Screw this. Come on, let's go. Whoa! Shane? Shane! Piper! Oh no! No! Piper, I'm out! No, no! No! - Can I get an assist? - I'm out. Great. These are new. Nasty little fuckers. You fought the big ones off too? Well, there's a win for the human variable. How many are with you? - Just us. - Holy shit. What do you two remember? Nothing. Apparently, I'm Piper. He's Shane. - I'm Madison. - Brock. No offense, darling, Shane seems like dead weight and I am not about to be robot target practice. Four is better than three. Fine, but if we're gonna drag his ass around, I'm gonna need one of those fancy little kicks. They boned me out on drop and how did you get two? - Four is better than three. - Listen, I'm outta ammunition, all right? There was a building with medical supplies and food. I'm guessing if they drop us in here to test these things, there's probably some stores of ammunition somewhere. I counted 15 buildings in the area. Appears to be one main road. Yeah, I don't know, maybe 10 across? Most of the vehicles are bombed out which means we're probably not the first unit. I'm sure we could find something to jump start. Try to get our way out of here. We were dropped in from out of town. We ran into a barrier. We think it's about 10 miles wide all around us. So we got to fight whether we like it or not. Yeah, it sure looks like that. Just don't get me fucking killed. Sir, that Spyder unit just deviated from its programming. It had 'em trapped. It's been 30 hours. No human casualties. Interesting. There's no reason why they shouldn't have completed their assignment. Sir, I was pinging their subnet addresses, but they just kept repeating. It doesn't make any sense. Some of the mech-4s aren't reporting anything at all. When did this start happening? The first drop yesterday. I'm working on it. They're all together now. Let's up the ante. Yes sir. - Hello? - Come on out. That's far enough. Turn around. Show us your neck. What do you remember? Not much. Not really anything, actually. My head's a mess. You didn't get a weapon? I woke up a few miles from town. Immediately attacked by one of those machines. I lost my pack running from that thing. Well, Blake, you aren't gonna do anyone much good hiding like a little bitch, now are you? On my way in, I passed what looked like a storage facility, like trucking docks, things like that. I thought it might be well stocked. Was waiting til dawn to make a break for it. And then there were five. Pull up the remaining inventory. Have any Mech-4s in the area? Yes sir. But communications seem to be interrupted. Sir, we have two in proximity. We believe we can lure them towards the subjects via radio signal. The suspense is killing me. I hope it lasts. Well, at least we made it through the night. That's a plus, right? I'm hungry. Gonna have to stop and refuel soon. We stop to eat and we're dead. We can wait til I get a firearm. Oh yeah? Who put you in charge? Nobody had to. You guys were obviously having a much harder time dealing with the situation than I am, so it makes sense that a man like me would have to pull up the slack for you guys, don't you agree, darling? Touch me again and I'll fucking blow your brains out. Guys, chill, all right, we're all hungry. We all want to survive this, so just calm the fuck down and we'll take five when we get to the facility, okay? Okay? Plus a grenade launcher at point blank range is probably not a good idea. That'd end our day pretty quick. Take cover! Take that one, go, go! Fine, I'm going up high, see if I can start something up. Shit, shit. - Where's Blake? - Where the fuck is Shane? Hell yeah. - Where's Blake? - Where the fuck is Shane? Pull up Agent Shane on the screen. Sir, we've lost contact with the mech-4s. We're losing control of this mission. Your job is to observe and report, Sergeant. We are right on track. Fuck. Cooling down, hydraulics down, control panel down and no signal. I can see the damn screen, Sergeant. Hey, run! Gun, I need a goddamn weapon! There's another mech-4 incoming. Sir, we are losing control. He's completely offline. Perhaps he learned something from his brothers in arms. How's our other soldier doing? He seems to be doing okay, sir. It appears to have assimilated just fine with the group. Good. We need him to stay with them. Nice shot. We need to get back to the facility and arm ourselves. - Where's Blake? - I don't know. Another mech, run! Over here. - I think they're gone. - That was close. You pussy. Where the hell were you, huh? - Hey. - Hey, enough, enough! You want me to fight 'em with my bare hands? Apparently I'm not wired for combat like you. Hey, enough, all right? If we want to get out of this shitty bubble, we got to start working like a team, okay? Let's just keep it together, okay? I don't want to end up like that guy. We won't if we play our cards right. If this facility of yours is a hit and a miss, I'll feed you to the mechs myself. Shit. General, we have a real problem. There are 30 mech-4s offline and another 60 Spyder mechs unaccounted for. I'm sorry, sir, our last option was a Trojan horse and I've searched for all backdoor access or any way anyone could have gotten in, but it seems that they're communicating on their own. Learning, yes. Isn't it beautiful? It's criminal. Sir, these mechs belong to the United States government. And you've turned 'em into an AI army that we can't even communicated with. Have you even considered what happens if they breech MechWood? I talk to them. I speak their language. I am their father. You know what, Sergeant Peterson, you're right. We do have a problem. You. Send him out. What? No, sir! You heard me! Get him out there! I can fix these mechs. They'll kill me out there! But you need me! I'm a coding engineer! Pull up the ground level camera. Yes sir. No, General! Please, let me back in, please! General! No! Facility's South of here. What else do you see? Looks like there's some kind of control tower just a few miles out to the north. What is it? There's a massive manhole. Appears to be the dead center of town. Why is it here? Maybe it leads outta here. Let's arm up before we waste any more time. We're sitting ducks here. I say we split up. One unit heads South to the facility. The other will scout the structure to the north. We'll rendezvous back here by sunset. I don't think we should split up. Well, nobody asked you, bitch. All right, I'm gonna go north. Don't trust this guy's intel. I'll go South with Madison and Brock, you good with that? Roger that. They're separating. This could be fun. Hey. Hey, come back. Come on! Go. Shit, I didn't see anything. We're wasting time. Do you think this is necessary? Anything? Yeah, it's about 20 feet tall, armed to the teeth, programmed to kill us, you happy? We're clear. What a bunch of junk. We're not too far off. Seems to be some kind of control tower. Start talking. Who are you? I'm Sergeant Brett Peterson. I'm a coding engineer with the army special warfare division Where's your jumpsuit? And the shit on your neck? I didn't sign up for this. I was taking orders from General Dex. That voice you've heard over the speakers. We didn't quite see eye to eye. So I got sent out here with you guys. But I'm not as helpless as he thinks I am. He's forgotten. I coded these mechs. You built these fuckers? Give me one good reason why I shouldn't blow your fucking brains out right now. Because if you kill me, you kill your only shot at getting outta here alive. What'd you think? This all ended with a pat on the back and a medal? No. This all ends when we get terminated. How many of those things are there? Too many. And we'll run out of food and ammo before we even get a chance at getting 'em all. And they've been acting different lately. They're not taking commands from the general anymore. Somehow you can help us. Yeah. There's a kill switch on the outer perimeter fence. If we get to that, we just might have a chance. Holy shit. Think they're on? I don't know, Blake. Why don't you go touch one of 'em? See what happens. But can they detect us? I don't think so. We're alive, right, so. That's good. Jackpot. Intelligence, is it only in the human brain or can it be transferred, or maybe built? Imagine a place where intelligent machines are working hand in hand with humans. Welcome to MechWood where the future meets you. If you're watching this film, you're one of the special chosen families who gets to live in this experimental community on the cutting edge of innovation and technologies. You will see around you an efficient system of sustainable living built and operated by mechanical machines or mechs, as we like to call them. They handle many of the dangers and menial tasks, giving humans a worry free and luxurious life. You'll be able to spend more time with your kids, pick up that hobby that you've been wanting to do all while mechs handle our trouble for us. Using human recognition coding, they can decipher a human face from nearly a mile away and are programmed to steer clear of danger to us, so don't worry. You'll be safe around these gentle giants. Isn't that right, boys? The engineers at MechWood designed nearly 30 different types of robotic assitants, all of which are under an intricate and state of the art network of communication. The first in our series is the mech-4, designed for construction and repair, the mech-4 stands at a staggering 30 feet tall and weighs nearly 62 metric tons. One mech-4 can repair and replace 10 power lines in one day or perhaps build and rebuild brick buildings in three days. We also have smaller mechs like the spyder mech series. These gentle creatures are proving to be extra helpful indoors. Need help jacking the car up for cleaning? Maybe you need someone to run for errands to the store. Spyder mechs are quick and agile. Using spatial recognition, they can scan their environment to see oncoming obstacles in a fraction of a second and are able to calculate the correct movements. So sit back and relax. Welcome to easy living. Welcome to your new life. Welcome to MechWood, where the future meets you. You've got to be kidding me. Corporal Diana Blaire. I appreciate you considering me for this opportunity. I've heard nothing but good things. Have you seen combat? Yes, I've been deployed three times, learned a lot, but I'm ready for more. I think that going to MechWood would really push me to a new level. I would love to go to MechWood. I'm Private Second Class Jennifer Harrison. I'm really just looking for a way to deepen my training. I think this could be a really good opportunity for me. Have you seen combat? Yeah. Too much. What do you know about MechWood? Well, I hear it's where the best of the best go to learn, to train. I want to be the best. I want to go to MechWood. My name is Daniel Brown and I just thought it was pretty badass to be a part of something so elite, you know? What do you expect to learn at MechWood? Well, I heard the people that go to MechWood are the best, and I'm the best, so obviously, I want to be there. I don't dick around. I take my training very seriously. And everybody that knows me knows that I'll do whatever it takes to complete my mission. I'd love to be on the cutting edge working with the mechs to help foster a safer future. What do you know about MechWood? It's the military's most elite training ground. Humans and the latest of military robotics working together. It'd be an honor to be sent there. Good. They lied to us. - That can't be good. - C'mon, let's go, let's go, go, move, move! So. Peterson thinks he's a hero. Adding him into the mix could be a nice challenge for the mechs' AI. Bringing the band back together. What do we have near town? We have five spyder mechs headed toward Main Street, sir. ETA? Give or take four minutes. Excellent. C'mon, c'mon. Did you get some ammo? Yeah, who's this guy? We need to find cover. We've got at least 20 mechs on our tail, maybe more. What? Hey, he's with them! He's with the general! I coded him! I should've blown your head off when I had the chance. Put it down. Whatever you have in your hand, put it down. We're not gonna ask you again. You coded that mech. You gave it life. But life does have a way of coming around full circle, doesn't it, Sergeant? You put me in here. Now you're really gonna find out what kind of variables you're working with. The human kind, General. Let's go, soldiers, on your feet! Hold tight! They attack in a circular pattern. Will someone tell me who this guy is? Sure thing, can we get outta here alive first? Go. They've never been good boys. Fire, fire, fire! Dump their data. Then ready X22. So you gonna tell us what the hell is going on here? We need some answers. Yeah, but first things first, I gotta remove these control chips from around your necks. You put one hand on me and I will splatter the ground with your brain matter. Hey, he's fine. That madman dropped him in here like the rest of us. Yeah, plus he sniffed out Blake, so. I knew we shouldn't have trusted that weaselly little shit. As long as these chips are on the back of your necks, the tower can see every one of your movements and read your vitals. And if you tamper with it, it could detonate and terminate you immediately. So you work with the general. I saw my recruitment video. Yeah, it might hurt a little. As long as these chips are in the back of your necks, the tower can read all your vitals and track all your movements. You weren't the only ones lied to. These mechs are no longer under the general's command. We're dealing with true AI out there? The general made these things self actualizing, self sufficient. If one goes down during an encounter, the others learn, they pay attention. Making them the most efficient killers on earth. Groups like you have been coming in every couple months for the past year. Red, blue, green. Yeah, we've seen the bodies. White seems to be the color in fashion. I gotta admit, though, I've never seen anyone make it as far as you have. I think we have a real good chance. Going up against these things at night is not wise. Especially without night vision. We should just stay here and rest. Who's next? Ladies first. What the hell is going on? Peterson, sir, looks like he removed all their coding devices. And we've lost visual on them. Sir, it appears there's a comm request coming in from the field. Well, put it through. What the hell is going on? You're on. - Sergeant Peterson. - Blake. - Is. - Yes. We know about the traitor. - I am sorry, sir. - You did what you could. They reloaded, but not before I could lead them to the facility. You have served your country well, soldier. Your life is not over. You will be rebuilt and you will be better than ever before. Thank you, sir. But why take our memories? You were told to wipe your memories so you'd have a clear mind out in the field, but in reality it was so that you wouldn't know the truth about what you were getting yourself into. All this feels kinda hazy. Most of your memories should come back. There are a few that may be lost permanently. Some of you may welcome that. You said there's a kill switch for the perimeter? Every program is built with a backdoor. MechWood is no exception. The kill switch would bring down the outer perimeter field. We find that, we get the hell out of here. The genesis of MechWood was founded on Project Titan. Human controlled weaponry. Humans and mechs working together to foster a better future. That's right. That's the reason why I came on board. But the general deemed it inefficient. He was more in favor of an AI interface. Yeah. Welcome to MechWood. Where the future meets you. There's an underground bunker that houses the remains of Project Titan. It's where all this started. We find that, we find the kill switch. Where is it? I'm working on it. They must all still be in that bank. If so, we have no way of pinging their exact location. There's a mech-4 on the corner. Pull up that camera. It's quiet out there. All right, the Titan site's about a quarter mile from here Remember, stay down low. They can't see well below them. Also, their vision can't multitrack quick. Yeah, without the nerd, we're doomed. No offense. All right, we're gonna form a tight circle around him, okay? You heard the man. Stay as low to the ground as possible and don't stop moving. Copy that. Piper, Piper, no, no! Where the fuck are they? Everywhere. And... We're back in business. Okay, here we go. Now we're talking. Data, data, data! We're flying out that door. Out that door now! - Go go go, c'mon. - Let's go. - Let's go, let's go. - Let's go. One of the agents appears to be terminated. Why are they still firing into the bank? The spyder mechs should've transferred the location data! We have visual, sir. Give me the comm. Next we got to remember to zigzag until we get there. Congratulations, troops, you've only lost one while managing to take out a record number of mechs. Yeah, I see you hiding on the corner of block eight. Piece of shit. Lucky for you those cameras don't fire back. All right, guys, we gotta stay focused. Make our way to the Project Titan site, all right, Brock? Take the front, Madison, middle, I'll take the rear. All right, ready, go, go, go, move! They're heading over to Project Titan bunker. Sir? Sergeant Shapiro, open the hatch. Sir, the X22 prototype has never been fully activated nor has it ever proven stable enough for active combat. I didn't realize you wanted to join Peterson out in the field. Yes sir. This is my world. And I've got three rogue agents and a fallen comrade back from the dead, roaming around in it. I think it's time we tested our full capabilities. Shit, I was here on my first day. It's quiet out there. Something seems off. This whole place is off. So let's hurry this the hell up. Got 'em. C'mon. How far along are we? Initiating sequence has been activated. Wake up, big boy. There it is. What, are you saying, the Titan's in that safe? Yeah. Hurry up. You're first. Clear. Clear. Wow. Well, this must be the Titan. What does it do? You get in it. Yeah, that ain't my thing, hombre. I'm not about to trust a mech. All right, I'll do it. - More power. - Apparently, they didn't send us in here with the good shit. No. No, they did not. - This should help. - Hopefully. System malfunction. There we go. Titan hatchway open. Awaiting pilot. Let's find that kill switch. Leave that to me. You guys go give 'em hell. Oh no. One of ours? Yes and no. It's Titan. Peterson. My new family versus my bastard son. I hope you brought your popcorn. You got eyes in there? Oh yeah, we're in business.000 Let's open her up, see what she can do, huh? Let's kill some robots. - Whoo! - Yeah, it works! As soon as the X22 is active, we're launching. Hydraulics are up. Fuel up. Power's up. It's beautiful. Oh shit. Wonderful! I've never seen this programming language before, but it appears as if all the other mechs are dumping their data to the X22. It's now self automating on all functions. Brock, you in position? C'mon, let's go go go, move! Hey, hey over, you motherfucker! C'mon. Why are the other mechs not reacting? They're all over Main Street. I got more of this, you piece of shit. Take out the Titan, dammit! There we go. I'm going down! Fish in a barrel. - Sir, we got a problem. - No shit, sergeant. Shane, Shane, get outta there! What the hell are they doing? Beats the hell outta me, but I ain't complaining. Shane, Brock, get in, come on, let's go! All right, come on, let's go. - Sir, we have a problem. - I'm not blind! There's corruptions everywhere. It's corrupting our own databases. They are heading out of town towards the perimeters. Is the perimeter kill switch ready? - I hope this works. - It'll work. I built it! Warning. Warning. Perimeter warning, 100 yards. We're gonna hit the perimeter. - 50 yards. Breach imminent. - Here goes nothing! Perimeter access granted. What are you waiting for? Seal it up. - Hold on. - Perimeter warning. This can't be happening. What are the protocols we have for this? Perimeter warning. Perimeter warning. Perimeter warning. Compose yourself, soldier. This was always a possible outcome. Perimeter warning. Perimeter warning. Perimeter warning. - What are you doing? - Perimeter warning. Perimeter warning. What camera is this? Perimeter warning. Perimeter warning. Perimeter warning. The government of the United States of America thanks you for your service. Now. Well? It was an honor dragging your dead weight around. Brock, I hope I never see you again. I hate to break this tender moment up, but let's get the hell outta here.
