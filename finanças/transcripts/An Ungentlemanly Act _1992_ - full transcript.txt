MAN SPEAKING SPANISH: Cheers for the lift, boss. Get your haircut before tonight. Sir. You too, driver. I always thought earrings and Figaro 'taches on parade, I thought was one of your windups. Have you gone native over the last year? These boys have done as many tours as yours. ENGINE TURNS OVER Morning, Mrs Mozeley. Morning, Henry. Guess what? I'm off the blacklist today. Aye, you'll be onto it again come closing time. Heh. THUD MAN: Argh! THUDDING, MAN SCREAMS ENGINE ROARS OUTSIDE Right. That's it! Ron? Dear God, that's the last horror film you get. No, I've come to the end of that! Come back here! Yeah. Try and get him something quieter next time would you? Well, what do you think, Anton? Not half bad, is it? Aye, glorious weather. Tropical uniform, I think, today. Good morning, Des. Oh, Vice-Commodore Gilobert. Thought you'd gone back for good. Army bloody Air Force! HE SPEAKS SPANISH Enjoy your bacon and eggs, Mr Farnworth? Excellent, Mrs King. I'll see if there's any ferries to South Georgia. Oh... Nothing you can do for him tonight either, despite your 10,000 ways with mutton, Mrs King. He's a vegetarian. That's all right. I do a lovely spaghetti Bolognese. Pipe down, it's the feds. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, this is Patrick Watts, your broadcasting officer. It's nine o'clock on Thursday 1st April, and here is the news from the Falkland Islands Broadcasting Station. There have been no further developments in South Georgia, where patrol ship Endurance is expected to put a party of Royal Marines ashore today to end the legal presence of Argentine scrap metal workers. 'Chief of Police Lamb is no nearer to solving the break-in 'at LADE, the Argentine airline office. 'Which involved the daubing of obscene slogans in toothpaste 'and the substituting of a Union Jack for the Argentine flag.' ALL TALK AT ONCE 'Former LADE manager Vice-Commodore Gilobert 'has returned to the islands 'to assist the police enquiry and improve security.' Come on, then, you lot. Hurry up, breakfast finished an hour ago. Major Norman, welcome to the Falkland Islands. Well, we have to do this, Major Norman, for the press, as you realise. A moment, I have to speak to Penguin News. Could you come over here for me? I'll see you presently. Right, sir. Congratulations, Major Norman, I hope you and your men have a wonderful year out here. Thank you, Mrs Hunt. I must say, I'll be sorry to see old friends go. Well, if you'll excuse me, Majors, I have some leaves to attend to. Gary, if this situation gets any worse, I think it right that you take over again. You know the ground. It's been a bit end-of-term-ish down here, Mike. I think you're probably sharper right now. Morning. Morning. Tony? The annual rugby match between the incoming Royal Marine garrison and the Stanley Ladies first 15, which was to be refereed by His Excellency the Governor, has been cancelled. I can just hear the sigh of relief from Major Norman and his men. Seriously, welcome to our community, Major Norman and your boys, and so long to Gary Noott and the team. Go and give Jen a hand in the front. Go on. You wouldn't mind giving Fifi the once over, would you, Don? Yes, she's next in line, Ma'am. Who was that girl? ENGINE HUMS Huh? Turn that down. ENGINE STOPS Who was that girl? Oh, er, did some revision last night with me, Mum. Slept in Diana's room. Revision in a party frock? ENGINE REVS I might just kill that boy before he flies back to school. Most likely another of the Argentine's bizarre ways of staking their claims. HE CHUCKLES They even fly officers' wives out here to have babies. Dare we even complain, when their military run our only air link? They're bound to know our Buenos Aires military attache had to pay his own bloody fair when he came to recce here last month. Well, a two-inch mortar should hold up any sub's landing party for a while. It's still got a crack in it, Mike. If anyone lands from this sub, the best I can do is invite them in for a short, sharp lecture and a glass of sherry. The FO at my briefing, bless him, were confident this was a niggling phase. How many in our submarine reaction party? Five. PENGUINS HONK Do you think this stuff stretches? Aye, this is the only beach short enough for it, Corporal Armour. Been looking forward to this. Clean-air, good open spaces for a weapons instructor. Wildlife. What are the females like? Five blokes to a bird down here, Corporal. Aye, but that lot aren't too fussy! Shut it, Geordie. PLANE HUMS OVERHEAD Argentine. Permission to give her an eye, Corporal. ARMOUR LAUGHS Yow! Tell Zero. RADIO TUNES THROUGH STATIONS TANGO MUSIC PLAYS No rumba-tango stuff in here, if you please. A bit difficult to avoid a whole continent, Mr King. I'm doubling you up tonight. Bookings coming in from Goose Green. I thought Government House was 25. 25 and three rings. One shot, two long. Er. Got you down for smoke-oh, I expect. What-oh? Smoke-oh. Elevenses. Yeah, 25, please, and three rings. One short, two long. One short, two long. I wouldn't mind using her as a necklace. Leave the Gunnery Officer a waitress, Corporal. Morning, Duchess. Fancy getting out of the wet? Here, I thought you were supposed to be on alert. And how would you know? We're going into Stanley to get my kids. Now, you gonna give us a lift or not? Sorry. Our mission's classified. Oh, the older one's a paper bag job. That was his wife, Corporal. Ex-wife. Yeah, well, she didn't strike me as a bag of laughs either. Sounds like you're well shot of her. And his kids, Corporal. ARMOUR LAUGHS Sorry, Geordie. A bit messy that. After wangling four tours, it was time to piss off anyway. What, with the marital bliss and the maintenance. But then God sussed us, eh? And fixed an international crisis. ARMOUR LAUGHS Hey, come on, don't hog it. Huh. Well, I'd shag her! Boys, don't stand in the rain. Pop into the kitchen for tea. Nanny and I keep an open house, you know? Come on, Farnworth, we're off to do some spying. I hear the west store's got a good tinned fruit shipment in. Good afternoon. Hello. Hello, young lady. Mrs Hunt? Excuse me. John's finished our conservatory, and I'd like to ask your advice about... Petunias, begonias, shrubs and grapes. Grapes? Yes, of course you must. Why don't you pop by about teatime tomorrow, if you like, we won't have much on. Yes, thank you very much. So, what time did you first notice the, er...? First thing in the morning. Right, OK, that's fine, thank you very much. We'll be in touch if there's anything. Be useful if we had some bloody kit to intercept transmissions, or at least some cheapo bugging device for all those gas workers up at the Goose. Gilobert doesn't seem to be inside any more, Sir. Hector. Lovely to see you. How's Teresa and the children? They miss the beaches. She's spending all my money in Harrods. Gone to London? No, the Buenos Aires range. CHUCKLING My successor, Major Mike Norman. Pleased to meet you. How do you do? Substantial Argentinian force invading at dawn, Gary. No doubt we sold them a substantial part of it. It takes days to sail that far. Radio transmissions, intercepts. GCHQ probably have only one person monitoring the entire continent's radio activity. Yet Joint Intelligence Committee must have known. Probably hoped the fleet would just go away. Anyway, Major Norman, it's up to you to advise how we make our dispositions accordingly. I'm going with Gary's contingency plans, Sir, because I've had no time to form an assessment of my own. I have resources to defend one beach. Choosing the deep one, on the assumption it'll be landing craft we face. If, on the other hand, they have modern amphibious personnel carriers it'll be the shallow beach they use. Have we had any intelligence? No intelligence. Only one MI6 man in Latin America. Even if he is in Argentina. Then it'll be bingo or bollocks. Stanley, we put the majority of Gary's men there, they can tie down hundreds of the enemy, even thousands, in street fighting. The walls are wood. There can be no fighting in Stanley. Good heavens. In the 50 years before I became Governor, there wasn't a single murder on the islands. It's about to change, Rex. I presume our objective is to hold out long enough for a UN resolution to be achieved. Or a cease-fire. You saw the telegram. The FO's not letting on. By evacuating Government House and taking to the hills, we protect Stanley and preserve sovereignty. You transmit to the islands, we carry out guerrilla attacks. If they don't actually land, we'll look ridiculous bolting to the hills. Besides, it's tantamount to leaving the front door open. Sir, as C&amp;C, you are a prime target for any snatch squads. The enemy will have excellent cover. Including the only trees on the island, I believe. And as for the walls, you said it yourself. We might as well do it like Zulu and form an infantry Square. It's a long way to the hills. Rough ground. Sir, you've approved the plan. As did your predecessor, and he had a wooden leg! Rex, if they come in from behind Stanley, cutting off escape routes, this will be our Alamo. Better we take it in the guts than the women and children. Thank you, gentlemen. I would have thought he would have asked me, after a year here, to resume command. C&amp;C. Never commanded in any more than a Spitfire myself. But then you were one of the few, weren't you, Rex? No, I'm afraid not. I missed the war by a whisker. Pray for a gale to dash them on the rocks like the Armada. Bastards. Bastards. Buenos Aires or London? REX COUGHS Hello, all stations. This is Nine, over. Radio check, over. What kind of weapons training have those naval hydrographers had? The droggies can hardly handle mapping pens, let alone assault rifles. Come on, prat! Thank you. I'll take that. Look what I've managed to... Good afternoon, Mavis. Sorry, Mavis, I forgot to say. Just a few things I have to arrange with the FIG. Yes. Yes, of course. I'm sorry. Pardon me. Couldn't cypher one, Sir. HE EXHALES The latest piece of joy from Whitehall is that the Argentines have excellent intelligence, probably via an inside element. Well, you don't need the brains of an Archbishop to work that one out. I'm sorry, Rex, but I simply can't believe that Hector Gilobert is capable of it. He wouldn't tell you if your coat caught fire. The Baha'i's perhaps. Oh, come off it, Ronnie, they're Americans. It's a question of do we lockup our Argentines now? And risk triggering the invasion, however much the better not is that the FO advise against it. Well, I think you're the one to judge that, Rex. Typical of Whitehall to choose this occasion for my first solo flight and not provide a parachute. Once documents went over the ship's side in the war, things were getting pretty grim, Ma'am. Dick, I know all about treading and bearing. Are you going to tell me what's up? Or do I have to force it out of my husband? I'm sorry, Mavis, but... THUDDING SHE GASPS Shut the door. Mavis, it's still classified. And HE is still up to his ears. Now, I'm sorry. THUDDING CONTINUES I suppose everyone is going to be working late. Yes. Then I'll tell cook to make a vat of lasagne. Thank you. BROKEN GLASS CLINKS HE CLEARS THROAT Rex, why have you not told Mavis? Saigon. What? 1975 was the last time we went off with our tails between our legs. Or rather, a Yank tail between Yank legs. Pretty undignified in our embassy too. Anyway, Mavis dug her heels in. She'd have clung to the bloody chopper rails if I hadn't thrown her bodily onto a Hong Kong flight. Now, I'm... I'm afraid if I tell her the truth, she'll refuse to budge tonight, even if it means going down with the ship. Can I get Mavis and Tony up to your house? If it's all right with Connie. Instead of standing there scratching your loose change, Wilco, go and check out our escape route. No chance of one of the inflatables, then? Instead of that? Yeah, there's two left. One with a hole in, and another one with two holes in. Someone's gonna carry the can for this. Yeah, us. Thank you, Don. Stiffen my resolve at whatever horror's to come. SHE SIGHS I expect it's the Argentines on the way. Don't you? No-one's told me either, Ma'am. Sorry, sir. Hey? Where's my...? It's right here, sir. Excuse me, Chief, Bill here used to work in air traffic control in his native land. This is it. The Argies come flying in to take the airport, right? This golf ball is the radio direction beacon, right? The desk is land, the floor is sea. You gotta have a signal late at tonight, right? But what they don't know, is that I'm gonna fix it to trick the incomers like so. Yes! APPLAUSE Well, that ought to drown a few of the buggers, sir. LAUGHTER The beacon is owned by the Argentines, Bill. The FO doesn't want any premature action against their property. GRUMBLING Oh, all right. Can you be sure it could work? Well, I'm not an avionics technician. One tool, fine adjustment. LAUGHTER If we can't alter the signal, we kill it. Bill? We'll take you up there. And do take care. I thought you Baha'i's came down to get away from it all. I'm a Shiite Muslim, Sir. Shiite Muslim? # Well, this could be the last time # This could be the last time # Maybe the last time # I don't know # Oh, no. # MEN CHEER CHEERING PRIEST SAYS PRAYER IN SPANISH SONG: 'Ave Maria' # Ave Maria # Gratia plena. # JAUNTY FOLK MUSIC My senses tell me that Hunt is contemplating a touch of the old Mano Dura. The British don't give a damn. They think the Falklands are like Scotland. The islanders, they've been shut out along with the Black and yellow races from other colonies. But these people go on pretending to be the leaders. Come on! They're also rather afraid of coming under a dictatorship that wipes out thousands of its own people. We could come to a solution. Safeguards. Joint sovereignty. Lisbon, something. Otherwise, by the 150th anniversary... HE CLICKS FINGERS Don't take any notice of the Latin macho tricks, Mr Winchester. I'd watch how much you said to him, too, about the situation. Don't worry, Des. You already told me the exact number of Marines they sent down on the Endurance. And even the names. Bollocks! LAUGHTER MUSIC RESUMES There you are. Mavis? Could I have a word, please? Excuse me. Right. That's the last one of documents. Thank God for that. What's that dog got in his mouth? Oh, Christ, it's Arthur! Why couldn't you leave it while you were digging? You stupid bugger! Come back here! Fritzy, drop the parrot! Fritzy! You bloody idiot! There's an invasion coming tonight, Mrs Lamb. Here, Fritzy! This is the sort of thing that only happens to Afghans and so on. I mean... They're not here... tonight. Why would anyone bother over half a million sheep and some seaweed? Mavis, you love it here. The people, yes. This house. How many Argentines are we talking about, anyway? At least a couple of thousand. For starters. Then why don't you just throw in the towel? The Marines will be arriving to set up soon. This will be operational HQ, and I don't want you or Tony, or any of the staff, staying overnight. You made me leave you in Saigon, I am not going to leave you now. We might be fired at! Your staying is out of question. Darling. It's not Saigon. That time I sent you thousands of miles away, tonight you'll be up the road at Dick and Connie's. She and the girls could do with some support. Where is Tony, by the way? Out with the usual boys, I believe. Well, would you call him to come home immediately? And then tell the staff to go to friends' houses. They can take their most precious possessions with them. Heaven, if something happened to you, I... I... Oh, they'll probably just blockade us. And we'll have to sort it out in the UN. A career of hardship postings, retirement round the corner, and the FO expect you to command a bloody battle! Come on, Mavis, let's be fair. Very few were actually hardship postings at all. They counted time and a half towards pension entitlement. They're bastards! Think of the places we could have gone. Well... this will show them just what they were missing. It could prove to be my finest hour if I keep my head. SHE WHIMPERS Keep your head. I bloody well hope you do! FOLK MUSIC PLAYS Thank you, Jimmy Shand and His Band. OK. Get your ears tuned in for the Governor, folks. 'Good evening. 'I have an important announcement to make 'about the Falkland Islands dispute. 'We have sought an emergency meeting of the Security Council.' There is mounting evidence that the Argentine forces are preparing to invade the islands. I am calling on all members, all active members, of the Falkland Islands Defence Force to report to the Drill Hall as soon as possible. Remain calm. Stay indoors. And please, do not add to the troubles of the security services by making demonstrations, or damaging Argentine property. 'This would play into their hands.' If the Security Council is not heeded by the Argentine government... ..I expect to declare a state of emergency. Perhaps before dawn. 'I shall let you know soon as I have anything further to report. 'Thank you.' Well, as the situation is rather serious... ..erm... FIBS will stay on the air throughout the night. As it says in those large, famously friendly letters on the cover of the Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, don't panic. And now for something appropriate. Strangers In The Night. MUSIC: 'Strangers In The Night' by Jack Jones You think this isn't happening, don't you? You said it never could. Thank you, all, straight back to work. Let's go. Oh, God. All right, quickly, outside. Dick, I've got to draft a state of emergency. Have you any idea how it's done? No. I'm afraid not. I think we'll have to go back to 1939. It sounds absurd, I know. Ah! But there you are. "We shall fight them on the beaches." If only we could. Bloody Argies! Get this, get this. See this. I see no ships! Lord Nelson? Maggie Thatcher. HE CHUCKLES Oh, thank you. All women out. Liqueur chocolate? Thanks, Mrs Hunt. TELEPHONE RINGS Have you seen the cat, Nanny? Oh... Forget the Wedgwood, nanny. Go on, quickly. Here. Ssh! Go. May I? Of course, yes. There you go. There. Now, off you go, quickly. Tony. It looks like you got your priorities right, Nanny. Come on. COUGHING MAN GAGS Oh, cheers, Tom. That'll take the taste away, boys. Dad? I'm volunteering for the Defence Force. Well, like I said... All right, Jim? Jim! All right, Jim? Jim, good man. Mike, Jim Fairfield. Ah. I heard your name, Jim. Was it Zulu Company Ulster? You always liked the punch-ups. Ah. Excuse me. Jim? You're not even in the FIDF. They walk round with their brains in their right hand, if you know what I mean. That's not fair, Jimmy. Besides, you've got a family. All right, you war-y bastard, see Colour Sergeant Muir here for a proper weapon. And maybe some kit, huh? The press, Sir. Gentleman. Evening, Sir. I persuaded Cable and Wireless to stay up all night. It's important to me personally that this story gets told as it happens. Since I suspect there are those who'd rather it wasn't. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you. Thanks. Oh, Mr Winchester, have you got a moment? Please, thank you. Can you imagine anything like this in my decades of diplomatic service? Kuching, Jesselton, Brunei, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Ankara, Saigon. Even Saigon, I can assure you, was not like this. Look at these telegrams. London must have known since yesterday, I expect. Is that attributable, Sir? Don't be daft. Just make sure the bloody beans are spilled over the front of tomorrow's Times. Now, go back and keep an eye on Gilobert for me. I, erm, I got wind of Tony's plans to join the FIDF. It's just the one son, is it? And a daughter back home. Ah, well, she's well out of it, then. No, not really. She's engaged to a lieutenant in the Marines who's served down here. He's bound to be on standby soon. If anyone bothers to get the place back for us, that is. They'll bother all right. If they're interested in staying in office. And we'll be reinforced at Government House by our guests - the Naval Hydrographers of HMS Endurance. It'll make a change from map making in the Antarctic. LAUGHTER Now, I haven't bullshitted you about the odds. We'll fight until the Governor throws in the towel or until we're overrun. Which probably means dying. I want you to face that... ..death. Think about what it means now. And when the firing starts, forget it. You are the Green Berets. The Royals. That means you will knock seven shades of excrement out of them before you go down. Don't get angry with whoever dropped you in the smelly stuff. You're in fathoms of it. And it's too late. Get angry with the arrogant bastards who are planning to waltz in here thinking you'll just take it up the bum. LAUGHTER Now, Gary's men know this place and like it. And I'm sure some of them have got local girls on their minds. Maybe even sheep. LAUGHTER But half of us haven't even had time to find the pub. Tonight, when the time comes... ..we're fighting for ourselves. For what Royal stands for. For one another. Any questions? All right, lads, let's go for it. Thanks, boss. Well done, mate. ENGINE HUMS OUTSIDE Couldn't have done it myself. There's 70 men here, right? And they're going to die. And there's fuck all you and I can do about it. ACOUSTIC GUITAR, ETHEREAL SINGING I know nothing of an invasion. Nothing. IMITATING: "I know nothing!" I'm sorry? HE SCOFFS Why don't we put the islanders on this spot. And all Argentine's gonna have is the Malvina. Sovereignty is indivisible. As they say. I know the Kelpers very well. My children speak English like... Well, like Kelpers. But what crime is there for you gringos speaking some Spanish, huh? SHE SPEAKS SPANISH Muy bien. This is Zero, have arrived at local Defence Force, over. Not many magazines or automatic weapons left. Good evening. Good evening. Not now you've taken those you need, Major. Good evening. Good evening. WOMAN: They pass easy for Molotovs. I'm going back to my doubts, for a shotgun. I want your best men positioned on the ridge above Government House. I'm afraid our chain of command comes from the Governor. I'll speak to him about it. Tell Sergeant Muir we'll do his best for the rest of them. Right. Right, boys and girls. I've come to volunteer, Major Norman. As what? Combat despatch rider, sir. REVS ENGINE No despatches to deliver, Tony. Ah, but the FOV of war. Your radio net will jam. And I'm the fastest thing on two wheels around here. He is, too, Sir. HE CHUCKLES I think the boss' son'll go home in a body bag. HE SIGHS GEORDIE BREAKS WIND, RELIEVED SIGH Permission to strangle a darkie, Corporal. Well, make sure no Argie jumps up with a bayonet to give you a second arsehole. HE LAUGHS A resting party for enemy nationals assemble in a waiting order, Sir. Not yet, major. Not before the invasion force is off our shores. Or the White House efforts fail. On another point, Sir. Mm-hm. I'm asking you to have the FIDF posted along the ridge behind us. I'll see what I can do. Thanks. Well done, Mavis. Thank you, Don. Major? Thank you, Mrs Hunt, very kind. Thank you, Mrs Hunt. You're beginning to bear up, darling. Does anyone want some more cocoa? Tony? Never mind. Your real place is at her side. Mm? I'm assigning Marine Dorey as your personal bodyguard from now on, Sir. Ah. What was your last pistol score like, Sir? Emptied every round from a Colt 45s each hand into a sandbag at 15 paces. But that was the north-west frontier 35 years ago. And this isn't a Colt 45. I expect you'll want to familiarise yourself with it, then, Sir. Ah. Yes. MAN SINGS IN OWN LANGUAGE Hey, Winchester. Why don't you piss off? Oi! You a closet Argie? No, Sergeant Major. Then make your weapon safe before you kill us all. Thank you, Sir. Fucking plant life. What frequency are you using tonight, Sir? Runners will phone in when they can. Here, Sir. Yes. Fuck off! No! That's very considerate of you, Major. You never know who might be skulking in the bushes tonight. Would you care for a drink? I think not, Mrs Hunt, thank you very much. Nobody wants to drink with me, Major. I'm not really a gin and tonic man myself. I have beer. Scottish, I believe. Can't let the Argies get that down their throats, now, can we? Sit down. All right? Thank you, Ma'am. SHE EXHALES Cheers. Cheers. It must be pretty upsetting for you. Just off the boat. Looking forward to year of ceremonials and outdoor pursuits. Actually, I think it makes it rather easier, not having any ties to the place. But you care about your boys, surely? Very much so. I mean, they are such lovely boys. It all seems too ghastly. What I'm asking is... ..sweet though the Falklands may be, they are... Do you really think they are worth the life of even a single Royal Marine? It would be letting the Corps of Marines down if we didn't put up a strong fight. Right. For what? Sheep at any price? I suspect my son would like to be you, given half a chance. He's a brave young man. He's a boy... ..who wanted to impress his father. And unless his father calls a halt, your boys will fight on until... Or until we are overrun. But I'm sure your husband will know when the game's up. I'm not. He's an extremely poor loser, Major. Can't you tell him when it's time to surrender? The boys wouldn't thank me for it. Surrender isn't something in our vocabulary, I'm afraid. She'll make sure heads roll for this. We are not entirely blameless too, you know, at Government House. What rot! You've been warning them for yonks something might happen. No. Do you remember those two Argentinian architectural students who visited, oh, months ago? Vaguely, why? The Anglo-Argentine one was so charming. His subject was Victorian colonial structures. I showed them round. They asked to see the building's plans. I even... HE CLEARS THROAT ..I even let them take photographs. RADIO CRACKLES HE WHISTLES GUN COCKS HE RESUMES WHISTLING TELEPHONE RINGS Gary, I... I'll see you tomorrow. Don! Oh, Don. Brilliant thinking. Right... Sorry I couldn't run you up to the baker's, Mrs Hunt. Only I'm helping with the defences here, you see? Erm... Mavis. Excuse me, please. Yes, of course. Dear... OK, Mum. Off we go. Cheerio, Dad. We'll see you in the morning. Yes. You know... HE CLEARS THROAT ..in my day... ..it was turn, cock, squeeze, turn. You wouldn't like to swap, Dorey? No. Wait here a minute. Don? You've bagged my 12-bore. HE CHUCKLES How come it's still up there? Well, Sir, I took the decision to leave it flying tonight, Sir. And to shoot the first Argie bastard who tries to take it down. Did I do the wrong thing, Sir? No. No, that's the spirit, Don. I... I was just thinking about the people who are coming here to trample all over us. Can I get you a brandy or a whiskey, Sir? I... ..I won't, thank you. Don... it would cheer me up no end, if you were to leave GH tonight. I'm not having you hurt. Any word from London, Dick? Well, I'm afraid... Nothing of any substance. Stupid of me to ask. What time is the Reagan-Galtieri talk? Well, the federal time, I mean, that's if the Argies take the bloody phone call this time, it is about one hour before the invasion fleet's ETA. Well, there's nothing much we can accomplish ourselves till then. So I suggest you do what I'm going to do. What, Sir? Get some sleep. GUN COCKS Halt. Who goes there? We're Brits. We're not Argentinians. My arse! I've never seen you before in my life. I'm Simon Winchester of the Sunday bloody Times. Hey, you were next to me in the Goose tonight. Look, we're only trying to get to Government House. Only? No-one's allowed near there. Passports? At present, there is no indication that the Argentine task force has changed course. Government House has asked everyone please not to go out to Cape Pembroke looking for it. And now, for Fred, Joyce, Pop and Biffo, from Dolly... Ah.

Point your gun at them, show them you mean business. That's it, come on. Right, this is the last stop.

He only had it put in last week. Ah, Government House said you'd be coming. Gilobert's vanished, I'm afraid. Oh, shit! What on earth are you trying to find now? Transmitters. In the lapels?

It might be pretty invaluable to have a Spanish speaker with us tonight in case there were a cease-fire or peace talks. Look, leave her be, Dick, leave her be. I haven't said anything about the unpaid bills. All right? All right, all right. Look, I'm gonna go home and put my head down for a while. Call me if you need me. Good boys. Take your positions in the West Wing. I'll detail someone to take these plonkers back to their hotel. Major, if you chaps are being written off, shouldn't some plonker tell the story? All right, you can have that cottage. But if the bullets do start flying, you'll be right in the crossfire. EXPLOSION I think it's the barracks, Mum. Mum? Doesn't look like they plan on taking any prisoners. Not likely to, Sir. The barracks were empty. REX CHUCKLES If we're contemplating making a painless move to the hills, now's the time, Sir. But we don't even know what's going on. Nobody spotted the enemy. Which probably means they landed south. Behind us. RADIO BUZZES Unless we make a move now, we won't be escaping anywhere. We can get out under cover of your FIDF men on the ridge. I decided to continue with our original plan of protecting key installations. There are barely enough FIDF men for that. RADIO CRACKLES Gary, we'd better get One and Five sections up there on the ridge. Mike. Half your men don't have any rations or sleeping bags. How long could they last outside Stanley? Sort of thing they enjoy enormously on survival exercises, Sir. And how often could I broadcast on radio before they home in on transmissions? Think positive, Sir. Keep your speeches brief. And keep on the move. What do we preserve by doing that, Major Norman? The seat of government. You, Sir. The seat of government will stay in this house. Others may have deserted these people, but not me. Five, nothing heard. Radio check, over. RADIO CRACKLES Zero, OK. Move to my location now, over. We are asking people to phone in whatever they see. I'll put on some more music, and we'll see what comes up after that. SOOTHING ORGAN PLAYS PENGUINS CHIRP I don't believe it. Cable and Wireless have lost the link with the UK. Telex phones, the lot. Sabotage? No, they are blaming it on tonight's ionosphere. One and Five sections are on their way, Sir. But it'll be ten minutes plus before they get into position. DICK GROANS HE WHISPERS: Don? Give me the gun and go. HE wants me to get a few of the fuzzy-wuzzies, Sir. Look, If they come swarming across that lawn, a few pellets aren't gonna save the flag now. It's time you went next door to your cottage. You'll be safe there. No! Please? GEESE HONK HE WHISPERS: Hey. SHEEP BLEATS What the bloody hell are we firing at? Get over the wall! Keep it coming! Get over the top of that bloody wall! Come on, move it. Come on! Bloody stun grenade. It's a stun grenade, go back! Come on. Get over that bloody wall! CRACKLING Get down, Sir! Now please stay down. All stations, this is Zero. My location... I'll say it again, my location under attack. Out. RADIO CRACKLES Sergeant Major, are you still in one piece? Yes, Sir. Right. Make sure all your boys are OK. And get them in firing position behind that wall. Oggie, are you there? Sergeant Major. Tibbs? Yes, Sergeant Major? Patterson? Right, Sergeant Major. You're not married, are you, Farnworth? Nope. Makes it that bit easier, if you see what I mean, Sir. Made by F Kinman, 1807, sir. Mr Hunt! Time to give up, Mr Hunt! Your phone is cut off. Armoured amphibious vehicles will be closing in soon. Mr Hunt? We have very superior numbers. I am sure you are a reasonable man. Come out with your hands on your head. Alone.

Down! Get down! Good lads! Come for a violent breakfast? Oi, you! Knob end! Get off the street! Aye, it's all right for youse. Some of us have to get to work. I don't why we're bothering with this lot. Sorry that took so long, Sir. Where is he? The situation is, there'll be between 12 and 18 Argentine APCs here soon. Maybe, oh, half an hour. Enough to blow the shit out of us. What do you advise now? It boils down to three options. One, we can stay here. We're doing pretty well. No casualties, though Christ knows how. Morale's good. The boys'll go on fighting as long as they're told. Two, we can break out now with you. And let Gary's men fight a mini guerrilla war. Three, negotiate while we're still dropping them. And before half an hour, when they start dropping us. GUNSHOTS THUD Dorey! Whatever he's doing, let that Argie live. You favour the break-out? Sir. I suppose you want me to make the bloody decision. One of the perks of the job, Sir. Let's try and contact Gilobert. See if he can reach their commander and mentioned a truce. We'll play for time. POP MUSIC PLAYS One, two, three, four. There you go.

Will you shut up, for Christ's sake! Rex, we've withdrawn to the Drill Hall. And now there are lots of Argentinians outside. Well, shoot them. There are lots and lots of Argentinians outside. Shoot some of them, then. We were perfectly willing to fight, but you ordered us back here. 'And now we're surrounded.' You say I ordered you back there? My men are very young, Sir. And they are very frightened. 'What do you propose we do?' Well... tell them to put their weapons at one end of the room and sit at the other. So when the Argentines come in, they can see that they are not armed and they are not aggressive. We've done that already, Sir. Very well. Thank them for me. And tell them to go home and get out of uniform. 'And do the same yourself.' ARGENTINIAN TROOPS EXCLAIM Oh, Christ, look at them! GUNSHOTS RICOCHET Aw, shite! Jesus! Go on, son.

I swear, Your Excellency, I don't. But whatever else I can do to help. What we've got to do, Hector, is broadcast an appeal to the commander of this force. Whoever he may be.

You see, there's a bastard up behind those rocks there, just tried to kill us. And he's gotta move sometime. REX CHUCKLES You, cover those rocks. You must have a few slates missing off your roof.

I'm not doing anything with a gun to my back. As you can hear, the Argentines have taken over the radio station. Get your gun out of my back. We've been taken over by the Argentines. Senor, un momento. They have taken over. They have phoned me to say they are not happy with the way I presented. Well, I'm sorry! Un momento. I'm sorry. I'm sorry if they are not happy with the way I presented. Uno, dos. I have tried to be fair. But I have tried to be unbiased. Our boys will not get shot... HE WHIMPERS Sir! That is ungentlemanly of you, Governor Hunt. It was a most ungentlemanly act of you to invade our islands. This is British territory, and I want you and your men off it at once. I command the Argentine task force that has reclaimed what is rightfully ours. Our governments agreed, in the United Nations, to settle their differences peacefully. I am a marine with the same job as your Royal Marines had in 1833. That is to take possession of these islands. All that is left is to prevent your men killing a few of mine. Whereas your job, Governor, is to prevent my men killing all your men. They have shown great courage and professionalism. Now it is time you ask them to surrender. I asked for a truce. Not a surrender. Your injured men need medical attention. Thank you for your concern. But this is the last place left under your flag. So we are not interested in any truce. I don't want to kill your men. But if you continue, then that is what you are asking me to do. You will be held responsible. No! The people who started the shooting are the ones who are responsible. We are simply defending ourselves. You leave me no choice but to tell my men to... To lay down their arms. Thank you, Governor. I must insist that you are ready to fly out within two hours. Oh, no, no, I couldn't possibly. Since I wasn't expecting guests, I haven't had time to pack. I am sure we could arrange an extension. Plus, I want all my Marines and Navy personnel flown out with me. And a farewell broadcast. Now, perhaps, if you will do me the honour. ARGENTINE SOLDIER: Vamos! Vamos! MAVIS GASPS Oh, my God! Oh!
