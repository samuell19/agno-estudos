Nino Surguladze Guram Pirtskhlava Marika Chichinadze in a Lana Gogoberidze film WALTZING ON THE PETSCHORA RIVER Script: Zaira Arsenishvili & Lana Gogoberidze Directed by Lana Gogoberidze Director of photography: Georgi Beridze Music: Georgi Tsintsadze Featuring Tamara Skhirtladze Irina Kupchenko Valentina Telichkina Guranda Gabuniya Daredjan Kharshiladze Berta Khapava Nino Arsenishvili Tamar Iashvili Nineli Chankvetadze Dodo Chichinadze "Man can be determined as a creature of reason, who, during each moment of his existence, critically reconsiders the conditions of this existence." Exactly, my friend. I'm being taken farther and farther away from you. We're not even allowed to correspond. But I'll still write to you every day, Anna. We've got several pencils which we broke into pieces. I now own a tiny piece of an indelible pencil with which I'm going to write letters to you. Perhaps some day I'll be able to mail them. Murderer! Bloodsucker! You'll pay for everything! How did you get in? We always left one key here. Who are you? This is my apartment. How come? My mother's grandfather built this house. The church wasn't even here then. You don't say! What do you need the church for? Come here. Why are you here? We're on an excursion from the orphanage. And where are all the rest? We stay near the train station. I told the teacher I'd go and visit my aunt, and that I know everything in Tbilisi - the funicular, the circus, and the zoo. She said, "Of course, you lived here!" I said I know everything here... That's enough! What orphanage are you from? It's in Kodjori, in a monastery's yard. Orphanage No. 5 for Homeless Children. Did anyone see you come in here? No. -Tell me the truth! -No. I'll be going. Wait. Help me take off my boots. I'm on my feet all day long and they swell. Come on, pull it off. You see how swollen it is. Now the other one! Good girl. I'm leaving. Bring me those slippers. Goodbye. May I take one of my books? -A book? Which one? -Ivanhoe. All right, take it. You got scared? -What's your name? -Anna. All right, you can stay until morning. And leave very early. All right. Don't open the door for anyone. Take a rouble and go. No one must see you. Let them stand closer to the ditch. Get ready! Fire! Here's a live one. They brought us in railroad carts with "cattle" written on them. And here we are, at the Kotlass transit camp. Women called MPEFs - Members of People's Enemies' Families. Today we finally parted with our previous lives and have begun new ones in the other world. First Miriam's husband was arrested, and then her 14 year-old son. She asked to be arrested too. Nino is the strongest of us. She's an actress and a philosopher's wife. She doesn't complain and keeps writing letters to her daughter. Keto is here because of her father. She was taken in after a successful operatic debut. Daredjan used to be a teacher. She's a very neat woman. Glasha saw her children die of famine. This is Tiko. She still believes in Stalin, the Great Leader. I don't understand what happened to our country. Why have we plunged into this horror? How can one keep from becoming desperate? How can one remain a human being? But we must survive. So that we can give evidence. And tell the truth to the people. It's worth living for that. I'm leaving. Goodbye. Do you have kerosene around here? Get me some. Is this kerosene? Sit down. Have some canned meat. -My parents didn't allow me to. -Why not? They said that our canned food could not be trusted. I'm sure that right now they'd be glad to have some canned food. You can't drink wine from that cup! Why not? It's very tasty. It's a tea cup! Don't be mad. Take it, it's a present from me. It's my mother's cup. Nothing here is your mother's or father's anymore! A tea cup! Do you hate me? Yes. You're a brave one. Thank you. You can stay here for a few days. After all, you have a right to. Hello. First they took Niko, and then Keto. And where are Bella and Ghizi? In the village with their grandma. Have there been any letters from my mother? Mama, Anna is here! Did you come from my house, dear? Yes, Pepo, from your house. Is it true? Yes, Pepo, and she locked the door. I did. That's good, because it's so windy there. -Let's have lunch. -I'm not hungry. I had lunch at home. -Is that man there? -Yes. Anna, let's go and play. Why is he so late? I hid them here. Who could've taken them? I can't understand it. No, I must go there. What if the windows are open? It's so windy there. Why haven't you come for so long? I live far away in a big forest. They must have picked the nuts already. Yes, Pepo, and they left a couple for the crow. For the crow? That's right. Did you take the letters? They were tied like this. No. Did you want to take them to the village? -I swear I didn't. -Open your suitcase. We could all be arrested for these letters. Oh, what are you doing? What are you doing? Elizbar wrote them to me from Paris. Children, come here and let's sing something. Papa! Anna is here. Hello, Uncle Andro. -What should we do, Andro? -Leave me alone! She must stay. Don't you see what's going on? I'm sorry for her, but... We can't just throw her out. I was reprimanded today at a meeting at my job. And everyone raised their hands. -What? And Noshrevan? -Yes. I hate to scare you, but what'll happen tomorrow? The severe sky becomes lower and lower. The furious ocean hurls its huge waves at the sky. And no one knows what the 300 women - Russian, Georgian, Armenian, Jewish - have to do with this struggle of the elements. They're sailing on an old boat. And no one knows where to or what for. You've come back? Come here and tell me where you were. I couldn't do anything. It was late and they left on an excursion to Mtskheta. Said that they'd stay there overnight. The teacher and the children waved to me from the train. Come here and tell me where you were, their names and whether they're related to you. I was at my aunt's. And what did your aunt tell you? I know: "Your dad's an enemy of the people, you get out of here!" No. No one was home. Where were they? Maybe hiding? The door was sealed like ours. Even if they were home, they wouldn't have let you stay. They would have. They're very good people! I know how good they are. I know how these good people report on each other. I'm a good person, because I let you stay. And you must listen to me. You must be obedient. And do everything you're told. Your father didn't listen to anyone, he used to say, "I'm a free person. I don't want to be a slave!" The point is you must know whom to obey. You must obey our leader! He's like a wall. You lean against him and he holds you up. Don't let doubt creep in or you won't notice how you've become an enemy! Where would I be now without our leader? I'd be ploughing. Can you imagine? Me, a peasant, and ploughing away. And now you prove your love for our leader! Sing a song or recite a poem. I'm waiting! You don't know a single poem about him? If anyone finds out that I let you stay here... Do you understand? You must prove your love. If not - get out of here. I can sing and recite a poem, the whole "Knight in a Tiger's Skin" if you want me to! It should be about our leader! "Dear Stalin, "Our hearts belong to you "The tree you've planted "is already giving fruit." We're going up the Petschora River. We move from one camp to another. Our chief goes ashore and comes back all upset and complains to us. No one wants to accept us. "You're no workers!" All the camps are closed for us. No one wants us! Uncle Mirian! It's me, Anna! I have it for you. Wait! Can't you see that my feet hardly hold me up? What do they want? They keep running back and forth! Why are you running away? Stop! My feet are failing me. Why are you staring at me? Don't you recognize me? Here's a letter for you. I was afraid to leave it there. And you kept running and running. -Thank you very much. -God be with you. You're like a real dancer. I used to take lessons. Did you get a letter? Come here. Did you get a letter? From your mother? You can't put a gun there. Why not? My grandma used to pray on that chair. The ones who pray are our enemies. You're a good girl. Show me the letter. You dance very well. This letter was thrown from a train. Come here. Why are you running away? Are you afraid of me? Today we saw a miracle. Yesterday the river began to be covered with a crust of ice and the boat moved forward with great difficulty. And finally it became ice-bound in the Petschora River. Everything became covered with ice like in the fairy tale about the city that turned into stone. Then we unloaded our belongings and began to walk along the river on the ice. Are you writing a letter? Nothing'll come of it. I'll help you. You must write in Russian. Smart girl! You know Russian. I know French, too. What is the French for "house"? And "table"? And "chair"? I know all the things in this room in French. Who's Bartholomew? What kind of a name is that? My grandpa's name was Bartolome. Then why "Bartholomew"? Your name in Russian will also be Savl and not Savle. All right. Who was he? He was a very good doctor. I was five years old when he died. Everyone loved him and patients came from all over. His picture used to hang here. Bullock carts with sick people stood on this street. All right, that's enough. Start writing. Start with "Thank you, comrade Stalin." No, not "comrade." Write: "Uncle Stalin, thank you for my happy childhood." Only don't say anything to anyone. -Do you understand? -Yes. Write: "Proletarians of the world, unite!" And then you can go on with your letter. Write that everything is fine. That your teachers treat you well, that the Papanin Arctic expedition is back from the drift-ice. I won't write about Papanin! I'm not interested. How can you say that? The whole world is interested, and you're not? No! I won't! And I won't write about the proletarians either. You'll do as I tell you! I won't, or Mama will think I've become a liar. And I don't need your help! You don't? Very well. The worse a wife of the people's enemy feels, the better. Why are you so ungrateful? I'm leaving! Just to come back again? Papa brought me this gramaphone from Moscow. Go to hell! My dear Mama, I miss you very much. Thank you, Uncle Stalin. THANK YOU, UNCLE STALIN! This is a real slum. Will we live there? How'll we drag all this? What should we take first? You see, Mariam, what has happened to us. I'll carry everything, and Datuna will help me. -Where should I take it? -Over there, to the yard. Will we just leave all this? Will you stay with us, Anna? Yes, and I've got my gramaphone with me. I'll tell you stories. Will you tell me about the city that turned to stone? Soon everything'll be cleared up and they'll return. Mama and Papa and your dad. Why haven't they cleared everything up till now? I don't know. I think about that all the time. Why should we stay here? Let's go to the village. We have a huge house there. And the Alazani Valley can be seen from our porch. Oh Lord, let us return home. What home, Pepo? The one they took away in 1924? You no longer have a house! And no porch? It's been torn down long ago. Mariko, this is an old cellar. You'd better leave before it gets dark, Anna. -Let her stay! -Shut up! Where can she stay? Where? You should return to the orphanage. You'll be better off there. They'll feed you and dress you. You see what's happened to us. I can be arrested any day now. Where will she go? Datuna! Don't be late, Anna. It's late, you'll catch cold. Go home. They gave me six huge bouquets of flowers. I was so happy after all my worries. I couldn't believe it when I sang the last "si." You can't imagine how hard it is. The chorus sings its choral, you mustn't make a clinker. And hold the fermata to the very end. You should've heard the applause! Mother and Father were so proud of me. Everyone was surprised that I had such a strong voice. And where is it now? I have a feeling... everything's become rusty inside of me. People can get used to anything, but I'll never get used to this. My God! Such mockery! Everyone always spoke about how neat I was. And here I am, a lousy teacher! I can't get rid of them, no matter what I do. I have to get used to them. They're so tiny and they also want to live. I can't bear it anymore! I should cut my hair, but I can't! That's the end, the end of everything! The traitors must be shot. Who's for that? Death to the people's enemies! Adopted unanimously! Do you have children? I had a daughter. She died when she was a year and a half. What was her name? Anna, like my mother's. And now you're here and you're Anna too. THANK YOU, DEAR STALIN! My son was a late child. Where could I hide him? They'd find him anyplace. He was only 14. I took him to the village to my mother. But the Cheka people know everything! My boy was so glad he could avenge his father. No, that was my fault. I should've taught him to worship the leaders. He hung Stalin's picture upside down! I deserve to be killed. What'll I tell Kote? I failed to save our boy. When they came he began running around the table. They caught him and led him away. Oh, my God, it's good that I'm cold and hungry, that I'm being humiliated. That there are so many unhappy people around me. That's my only consolation. What a bitter consolation! This is my new home, Mother. I must light a candle for the Djumat Virgin. What are you talking about? You were christened there. Look how it opens. Here's a fourth one. It's the smallest. The things people invent! -You're doing well, Sonny. -That's nothing. You've been quick since you were a child. Look here, this is a chair for praying. Look, there's a cross! Where? Is this that girl? Hello. Don't you say hello here? Good morning. -What's your name? -Anna. I'm also Anna. This is from Chkonia's orchard, which was given to us. There was a very good crop this year. There wasn't a single rotten nut! Give me a plate for the cheese. For how long do you intend to be a bachelor? You couldn't get along with your first wife. You will with your second. You've made a career! Any woman would be glad to marry you. The little devil knows how to keep house. She's a very smart girl. She can also dance and sing. Really? Do you remember Nick, whom you deprived of his property? His son was arrested. They said he was an English spy because he poisoned his hens. Sonny, tell me: Is it true that they're people's enemies? I agree that our people are stupid, but can a peasant poison his own hens? Take me by the hand, Anna. Without you I won't be able to bear this journey. Hold my hand tightly. You probably want to know where we're going. I don't know, Anna. And no one else does, except for several evil spirits, those who live in fairy tales, remember? They pronounced the evil words and wrote them on a piece of paper. And that's why we're wandering all over the world. Where are we going? What for? Why? They must have forgotten that themselves. You see, Tiko's child is also holding her hand. And Mariam's. And Inna's. And Daredjan's. And Minadora's. You see how that woman fell down? Her child must've let go of her hand. You see how another one fell down... still another. You know, I think I'll rest too. I'll lie in the snow and close my eyes... You can let go of my hand for awhile. This'll come in handy. It's my father's coat! Before you owned everything. Now it's our turn. Put that coat back, it's my father's! Where is your father? They'll come back - both my father and mother! -When'll he come back? -He will! What was his sentence? Ten years without the right to correspond? That means firing squad! Are you crazy? Are you ready? Let's go. What's the matter with you? The girl ran away. She's in the attic. -But why? -She's hardly dressed! What do you want from me? Leave me alone! Send me to my mother! You arrest everyone. Send me to the Petschora River! I'll go and find my mother! I don't want to stay with you and your mother! Arrest me! I'll go to the orphanage, anything to get away from you. Arrest me and send me to the Petschora River! What did you tell her? I told her everything. About the fire in the village, how the neighbors hate us, and that your father wants to move to the city. And I'm waiting for some madman to cut our throats! I won't let her go. She should live in her own house. I'm so frightened. Oh, Lord! I don't know what I'm afraid of. I beg you, Lord! Save and keep my son! Oh, Lord! I'm calling to you from an abyss. I hope You can hear me. Monsters have destroyed Your earthly home and they've fouled our hearts. Bring them to reason, those foolish people. Don't let the Devil triumph. I'm afraid, Lord for You and for myself and for all of us. What if the Devil overtakes the world, and our sinful earth? Save us, oh Lord! His eyes are covetous and his hands are greedy. I'm afraid he'll get to You. Oh Lord, have mercy on us. Get ready... fire! Our great compatriot! Every Georgian is proud that you were born in our land. We're miserable women, and we appeal to You. We wander by land and sea, all around the world. We journey by train, by ship or on foot. Every bird has its nest, but we've been chased away from everywhere. Isn't there a camp for us among the many camps? Isn't there a single prison that could accept us? We're not afraid of hunger and poverty. We're ready to serve our Motherland as you want us to. We're just asking for a dwelling place. Let it be at the end of the world. We're asking you, the leader of all oppressed people, we women who are toiling along the Petschora. As a true patriot I'm indignant. with the behavior of Savle Namicheishvili, who has abandoned his wife, and is taking care of an MPEF's daughter. This means he's taking care of a people's enemy. I believe there is no place among us for such a person. We all received a Christmas present today. In the morning Daredjan said that she dreamed of a road. And that means that we'll be freed. At first we believed, but then began to doubt it. There was no way we could get out of here. Maria said we should try to find some reindeer. But where could we find them? And suddenly they appeared, far away, near the horizon. Daredjan's dream was coming true. I'm sure that when we come to the camp the chief will tell us: "Garsevanishvili! You're leaving! And Mgaloblishvili! And Gulisashvili! And Bibileishvili! Bakuradze! Tarkhnishvili! Salukvadze! And Sokolovskaya." -And you, Nino? -"Makashvili, you're leaving!" -Does Namicheishvili live here? -Yes. -Who are you? -We live here. -We must search the place. -Where's Savle? He's been arrested. Hurry up! There're so many books, it's incredible. It's a good apartment. Look how the table opens. Who'll get this apartment? Katamadze or Nomoradze? No one will give Katamadze such an apartment. He's nobody's fool. Where should we take you? To the Orphanage for Homeless Children No. 5. It's in the monastery's yard. Come on.
