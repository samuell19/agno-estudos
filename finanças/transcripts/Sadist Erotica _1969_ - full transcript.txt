Yes, yes, I know you have separated from Mr. Radeck, and I don't know your grounds, and it doesn't concern me, but I-I have spoken, a while ago, to Mr. Radeck. He is suffering very much under this separation, and he asked me to arrange a talk with you. Madam, that's quite impossible. Lida, you've been working for me for the last two years and I hope you've always felt at home here. You've had every wish fulfilled. Yes, I know, Madam, but in this case, it really doesn't go. You see, Lida, I'm in a difficult situation. Mr. Radeck wasn't only a good customer of mine, I'm also personally obliged because my business hasn't always run so well as now. He has often helped me out. Child, you must meet him. I really don't see any other possibilities. - Speak with him. - When? He should be here at any moment, and I would be very thankful if you would wait for him. Good, Madam. But I'm only doing it for you. Thank you. Sometimes I don't understand this world.

I'm not happy about it either. So, my friend, we know exactly what this woman looks like. We must verify it, that's all. She had quite a well-built figure, hadn't she? No, quite slender. Hair color was blond, right? No idea. She was wearing a hood. - Black eyes? - Green. - Green? - Believe me. But lots of tits, huh? Ah, well, I've seen better. She wasn't that stacked.

No, never. Is it possible that Lida posed for that picture without you knowing about it? Impossible. It's impossible, I know that. A few days before she disappeared, she... began to paint on herself an artificial sort of birthmark like that, but... Well, it's absolutely clear now. That picture was painted after her disappearance. Well then, I'm on the right track. I will continue, but it will cost you $50,000. I'll agree. I've gotta have that girl back because I love her, and please, find out who painted that picture. All right. Give me $25,000 as first payment. The other $25,000 you'll pay when I bring Lida, dead or alive. Here are your $25,000. It's my personal check. - Don't move. - Take it.

No. I'm very happy that art is still appreciated in our house, even if it is so late. Good night, sir. Good night. Ouch! Quiet. You're too fat for Paul. There are all those photos. In the last two years, there have been eight women disappearing under the same circumstances. What gives you the idea that they were all murdered? There are other reasons why women disappear. You ran away more than once yourself, and not only from home. Isn't that so? Don't talk so stupidly. That fits to me. - There again, you're right. - What do you want? Men love dumb women, and that's the most important thing for me. If that makes you happy, but it is really so. All those cases are similar in some way. Everywhere, the same traces of violence. But most men are slightly brutal. Do tell me. There must be a guy with long and strong fingernails like claws. - Do you like that too? - Oh! The evidence and places of occurrence fit together. Here, on one of the Caribbean islands, on Topa Tara, a mulatto disappears, traces of a battle in her bungalow. On different pieces can be found scratches that run parallel and are very deep. You see, it's always the same. A few months later, Camilla Pearson, a model, disappears. A similar case. She was last seen with a man, about 40 years old, southern type. Camilla's last residence was a third-class hotel. All the girls were either dancers, photo models, or mannequins. No one knows whether the girls are dead or not. They could have been kidnapped, but I don't believe it, because if it dealt with white traffic one could find out about it through the international organizations. Only in the case with Lida is there any evidence, and that's the photo. What does your masculine intellect make of it? Well, if you saw the picture, you might think it was painted at the hour of her death. That would mean we are dealing with an insane murderer. What kind of case do you always choose? I don't think for a second that I'll be the next victim. [laughs] Afraid? [footsteps] Come on over here. There! [man grunting] But, my ladies, do you treat all your guests this way? Only our favorite. What do you want? Mr. Lamoins sent me. I'm supposed to look at your house. Ah ha. He said you're only here for a short while, and I am looking for something in this size, and secondly, I like the situation I'm in. I mean, of course, when I think it over, I can stand it like this. Hold me tight, my darling, and never let me go. How did you get in here? How else? Through the door. You must understand I've got a peculiar habit. - I always go through doors. - Peculiar bird. Do you like him, or shall we throw him out? Oh, mamma mia, don't do that to me. Just let me get up. You have no idea who you are sending away. Well, let's hear it. You'll hardly believe it. I'm Vittorio Freda. Hmm. It's very nice here. Yes, I like it very much. I'll be staying here this winter. Did you do this all by yourselves? I did the foundation, she did the rest. Now you've seen everything, so get lost. No, I still haven't seen the bedroom. Sorry to disappoint you. You can't go in there right now. Paul Newman's there. I'll wait. Ah, is my throat dry again today? How 'bout a drink? I only have a Coke in the fridge. I'm not sure you deserve having it. What a pity it would be. May I ask you to disappear the same way you came in: - through the door. - Yes, yes, yes. I always go through the door. That's what I had said. But, children, this is a day of the missed opportunities. I must see you again! Ciao! I'll never live this down. I really don't care for that type. I find him wonderful. Oh, you find them all wonderful, but now we're going to work. No, I do't want to. I don't feel like it. I thought you wanted to earn some money. You should think of Hollywood. We need diamonds as big as nuts. What should I do? I'd say that you take Dress Number 3A, and then to the gallery. Oh! It's really wonderful! Fantastic! Even at the entrance, these treasures! Oh, and there! I'm overwhelmed, enthused! Exciting! Such a beautiful child, and so much blood! Are you the Master? I'm a critic. Ask over there. Oh, wonderful. Exorbitant. I'll ask over there. One doesn't know where one should first look. Aw, doesn't she look like Snow White? As if she were asleep. Scatterbrained female. Oh, only once to be tied like that. - That could be had. - Are your the creator? Sorry, no. But the Master must be somewhere to be found. - Are you him? - Oh, no. That statue over there. - Do you work here, my good man? - [man] Yes. Please see to it that I can meet the Master. I might want to buy a few of his pieces... for cash. [man] I'm sorry, but Mr. Tiller is not here. That's unbelievable. He must dedicate himself to his business. [laughter] [man] Please, come with me. Excuse me, but this lady would like to speak to you. Good day, madam. I've got you. Now I can live, Master. Oh, no, I'm just the director of the gallery. - Please, have a seat. - Thank you. I'm very happy that I've been able to meet you. My name is Anastasia Dos Santos. I am the Countess de la Contagia, and the Marquesa Cumbre Sadinas. Oh, my beloved Director, many pieces from your house will beautify my lonely life in Brazil. I would like to buy pictures, especially statues. I love statues more than anything else. Oh, madam, please. I'm very unhappy that I must tell you... My dear friend, I must get to know the Master. I cannot live without the Master and his works anymore. And you, you will really help me. I will pay you any price for it, and I will do anything for the one who fulfills my heart's desire. My dear Director. But that is impossible. I understand. He is a sensitive man. Some sort of genius. What was his name? Something like Papagano? - Paganini? - No! His name is Klaus Tiller... but he talks to no one. I'm not so sure about that. If he would only see me, then perhaps I could model for him. I do have a wonderful figure. Hmm, with some imagination one could imagine that. Nevertheless, I have to disappoint you. You can't get to meet him because he's not here. You dare tell a Cumbre Sadina such a lie? Please believe me. Even I only get to talk to his lawyer. Mr. Tiller himself, I've never seen. But the worst of it is that I am not authorized to sell. Not even one of his works of art. Even for that you would have to contact his personal lawyer in Paris. But I'll do everything in my power... Oh, you are so generous, Mr... Albert. Albert Carimbaldi. Oh, my dear Albert, I would like to return my gratitude, but I just don't know how. I am agreeable. Please consider me at your disposal. Then I can expect you this evening?

A little rum... and a little olive oil... [giggling] Be careful. We still need him. And on top of that, a little whiskey. That'll make it good. You're brutal. Small fry. Countess, you were gone so long. I've missed you so. Thank you. Please. [choking] Is it too strong for you? Yes... Ugh... Oh, you are wonderful. Breathtakingly beautiful. My dear Director, you wanted to tell me about the painter. About the painter we can talk later on. No, tell me about the Master. You know I need him like I need air to breathe. Air, air, yes, it's getting too warm for me too. My beloved, come back. - Couldn't we just... - That's impossible. I've very little on. Haven't you noticed that yet? And if I get in a draft... Come on over here. Absolutely not. Not on the sofa. I certainly couldn't talk to you about painters. I'm a quiet and discreet lover, understand? Oh. What, the flowers? I find it romantic when the perfume of flowers surrounds me. But let's talk about the Master. I don't know anything more about him than you. He paints and he is a sculptor. But he does contact you about business matters, doesn't he? No, no. We do everything through his lawyer. Well then, I can never buy one of his works... Yes, through one single person. - Who is that? - Me. Oh, and you'll help me? [groans] My dear child, I'll do everything for you, but it's not so easy. What's the matter?

I'm happy enough if I can get the figure we really need. Then besides that, it's a question of the money. I don't like to part with it that easily. - To the next one. - Exert yourself.

[breathing loudly] [gunshot, glass shatters] [crying out] [gas hissing] [coughing] Come on! Let's go! You could have used something other than that fog bomb. Next time I'll take laughing gas. And I'll take you alive for me. [laughs] I can't get any air because that unshaven idiot grabbed me around the throat and then you come along and give me the rest. Girls, this was such a hot night. And I thought I was so far that nothing could excite me anymore. - Inspector Tanner. - This is Tanner. Uh-huh, I'm speaking. This is Red Lips. - Is it really you? - Yes. Then listen to me very well. I sent to you by mail the solution to a very important case. Naturally, there's no point to it if you don't even read the mail. Yes, naturally. Well, take a look now. Can't you even read? - It's not here. - Yes, yes. It must be there. I mailed it. - I think you smoke too much. - Huh? Nonsense. That's not healthy. Have you finally got it? Yes, yes, I believe this is it. So then, read it, my dear. Bye bye. Hello? Hello? What nonsense. Hmm.

Man, do something now. ♪ Hello there! - [little girl] Hello. - Huh? Looking for somebody? Yes. Who actually lives in this house? We live here. Oh, no. I'm looking for someone by the name of Tiller. Tiller? Don't know him. [groans] Okay, then our dear Inspector has strained himself for nothing. I don't care if he has. I just want to get away from here. But Tiller has disappeared without a clue, and we're to suffer here. Understand me finally. I don't want to wake up at night and find a crazy person coming here in the room and grabbing me around the neck. I want to get away from here. No one will get you around your beautiful neck as long as I'm here. [boy] Hello, ladies! Oh! What is it? Flowers for you. Ah, yes, naturally. Thank you. Thank you. - For your balcony. - Now even the youngsters are trying tot seduce me. What a dish. Hmm. From an unknown admirer. Isn't that wonderful? It must be from Maloo. There's something ticking inside of it. - What are you doing?! - Outside with them! They're mine! They're mine! Come back! Come back! [fast-paced jazz music ♪] Get down! [explosion] Oh, such a dirty deal! And I was just at the hairdresser. Ugh. We had luck. [gunshots] [screaming] [gunshots] [coughing] I don't understand what you have against a trip. I don't know either. [coughs] Maybe for a change we should go to the sea. We'll look for a wonderful island under the blue sky, and in the area of Ankara, in case we need money from Radeck. We will lie on the sand and the sun will turn my body into gold. [laid-back Latin music ♪] [people chattering] [music ends ♪] [waves crashing] I've wished for this for a long time. Vacation is something wonderful. Ah, when the sun burns on one's stomach... and one has nothing to do but to lay around. We're all alone and no one to bother us. ♪ La da da-da da-da - What do you think of this? - What are you doing here? Oh, I was just going to ask you the same. We're relaxing. We need our peace. Say, are you still angry at me over the sculpture? [Vittorio laughs] What do you mean? How could anyone be angry at you? That satisfies me. The living is short. One should use every second. Hey, cut that out. All right, then. We'll continue this evening. You're living at the Macario? I will call you. You know that too? Oh, Vittorio Freda knows everybody and everybody knows him. Oh, how wonderful that I've met you, and I hope you'll relax, too. Ciao, ciao. ♪ La da da da-da dum Well, relax, Regina. [sighs] I don't understand why you brought that thing along. The people at customs thought we were traveling with a corpse. It's embarrassing. [phone ringing] Do you think I'd leave this costly item at home? I've a feeling we can still use this thing. Hello? Yes? It's that playboy for you. Oh! Let him invite you and then bring him back here with you. We'll check him out and see what he's up to. I can't think of anything better to do than to check him out. Hello? Vittorio? Yes. [people chattering, traffic] Good day. I had reserved a room under the name of James Bond. How come the name James Bond? Then one doesn't notice we're from the police. James Bond? Apartment 45, boy. [phone buzzes] How do people get to use the name James Bond? Good afternoon, Miss Alphonse. - Ooh! - Pardon me. Oh, pardon me. I'm awful sorry. Yes, two rooms for next week. Okay.

Thank you. Oh, that was wonderful. Waiter! Uh, Number Three, please. Right away, sir. But what do you mean by Number Three? Why, every child knows that there are four kinds of Martini cocktails. Number One: four part gin and one part Martini. Number Two: five parts gin, and with the cork from the Martini bottle lightly over the edge of the glass. Number Three: pure gin and Martini bottle placed on the table, and when drinking, just staring at it. And Number Four: Pure gin and always think about the Martini. So if I understand you correctly, I should bring you a four-part gin. Exactly, that's it. - And some fresh blood for the... - Yes, sometimes. Without fantasy, one's life isn't worth anything, and one doesn't only need it when drinking. Let the blue flower of your fantasy bloom. Be careful. Once I begin I can't stop it. Hmm? Did something drop? No, I find the carpet so beautiful. A wonderful old piece. I'll take care of it. - So...? - We can forget about it now. You forgot to order for the lady so I brought two of them. To a blond girl who can't be matched. Mm! Aren't you well? I hope it isn't serious. Oh no, my grandmother always did this when the drink was too strong. Down under the table... and stay like this for a while. I guess, if it helps. But don't you find it a little uncomfortable down here? Oh, no, I don't mind that. At least I'm alone with you, Vittorio. From me he doesn't get a single passita. [giggling] You are a strange girl. Who? Me? Ah, when I think it over, what I've experienced with you, it all began on the floor. There, I couldn't love you because I was held fast, and the a statue separated us, and now we're spending the night under the table. I don't now how I've earned that. Really... Now make up your mind at last. This up and down is getting too boring for me in the long run. Come on. We'll go to my place. With pleasure. But right away, then. [ominous music ♪] [sighs] Come on, darling. ♪ [sigh, yawn] ♪ [screams] [gunshot] Good evening. I'm very grateful to you. Who are you? What are you doing here? I'm a friend. Just passing by. Don't be frightened. You can go back to sleep. The matter is settled for now, but please, give my very best regards to your friend, - the Countess de Santos. - What? Oh, excuse me. I forgot to introduce myself. Inspector Maloo. Ah, the famous Maloo. What are you doing on this island? I'm making sure that they... Oh, pardon. I mean that no pretty girls get murdered here. Nice of you. You and your girlfriend are completely different, but you do have something in common... Let us say, then, that you joined up to create a figure, like Zorro or the Phantom. It would be very difficult to identify them. We have something in common. Oh, you have that. I admit that's something very important. Take your size, your coloring, the shape of your lips. Very red lips. Oh, I find that very interesting. Explain it to me a little bit closer. No, no, no. No, I haven't got any time. We'll come back to it later, but don't forget, Maloo is on your side. Bye-bye. And what about your girlfriend? Won't she wake up? Of course not. Don't be afraid. When she sleeps, she sleeps. Are you sure? But darling, I want to be alone with you, and if she should wake up she's as nice as I am. You'll see. Come on, kiss me. We've wasted too much time already. [car horn blares] [gasps] What's the matter? Has your courage deserted you? I'm sure she didn't hear anything. You don't even have to be very quiet either. You're just saying that. Oh, she sleeps like a log. Well, come on. - Finally alone. - Yes. [groaning] Well? I'm ticklish! [gasping, laughing] No! Enough? Let's try Method H. - You two... - Yes? Stop it! Stop it! He will tell us everything. You won't get a word out of me. He loves martinis. Youngster's earned his bottle. For whom do you work? I don't know... [sputtering] You can't think of anything, sweetie? For whom do you work? - Answer! - For Tiller! Stop! Now, come on, tell me. Why does Tiller want that sculpture again? I don't know! I-I-I... I-I really don't know why. Hmm? He can't get enough. He drinks just like a fish. [Vittorio sputtering] You still haven't answered my question. Why does he want the sculpture? Stop it. We are here... [babbling] Now come on over here... Hello! How is everybody? Alcoholics are really horrible. What now? [sighs] [babbling] It looked like he could take a lot. It's always the same with these muscle men. Yes. Hey, I've got an idea. What is it? How 'bout we... [gasps] - Nice job. It's broken. - Yes. [ominous music ♪] Ugh! It's a girl! It's horrible. Yes. Now I know why he had to have that sculpture back. She's got to disappear. What are we going to do? Where can we take her? Ugh... I don't know. Best thing to do is leave her in there and plaster her up and deliver her. - Huh? - Two beautiful presents for Tanner.

There's a lot more out in the garden. Come on in. Oh, no, no, no. Actually, I didn't want to bother. - Hello. - You know each other? To what do we owe the honor of this visit? Uh, number one: naturally I wanted to see you, and wanted to ask you if you knew a certain Vittorio Freda and if you spent your expensive alcohol on him. Oh, Vittorio Freda? Never heard of him. Don't know what you're talking about. Uh-huh, uh-huh... And then I wanted to invite you both to dinner. My friend has a date, but I'd love to. This is very unpleasant. I'm very sorry you can't join us. Maybe it'll work out some other time. Postponed isn't cancelled.

I think it's about time we brought this farce to an end. Lida Regnier was only a bait to get you to come over here, you know. The murderer gives the instructions to find his victim.

I don't want to hear any more. All right. The millionaire, Radeck, gave us the job to find Lida Regnier. We have found her and my girlfriend in cashing in at this very moment. $25,000. And you have solved a big case. [both speaking foreign language] I don't think he understood you. Maybe I speak a dialect. Yes, it can happen. What, Radeck has returned? Since when? What dip you mean "returned"? He lives in Ankara. Yes, I know. He had his office. But he has lived on this island. He has made his money here. Lately, he went to North Africa. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Well, say it finally. What's the matter? Tiller lived in North Africa a long time. Is that a coincidence? - How long ago was that? - Just about four years ago. Four years ago? That would be about right. And your girlfriend is now with him? Yes, and we've got to go there now! - Come on. - Yes! - What's the rush? - Oh... I just wanted to arrest you, Red Lips. Inspector, I swear to you everything is in order. We know who the murderer is.
