25.000 English SDH RETAiL DVD Subrip PAL ? 21.06.2020 (Thunder crashing) (Man) Let's find him. I know he's here somewhere. Come on, look for it. I know it's here. (2nd man) There! (Man) Over to the right. That's it. There it is! That's it. All right! - This is it, all right. - Rip this sucker open! Get a look at the main man! (Laughing and whooping) Come on, dig. Deeper. (Whooping) Come on, dig. Come on, let's dig! Come on, faster! Dig! (Laughing) Get all the dirt off and we'll pry it open. This is it. Come on! Come on. - Pry. - Move it over here. - (Grunting) - Harder. Come on. Come on, Neil! OK, here it comes. (Laughs hysterically) (Whimpering) No... No... please, no! (Boy gasping) No! (Birds chirp, sheep bleat) (Man) That must be the new kid. Last stop. Everybody out. Tommy? Hey! (Whistles) No? Beautiful. Sit there. I don't give a shit. Hey. How you doing? Tommy Jarvis? Hi, my name is Pam Roberts. I'm the assistant director. I'm glad you're here. Well, if you'd like to grab your things, I'll take you in to meet the doctor, OK? Great. Thank you. Anytime, doll. How was the ride? Come on, Tommy. You OK? (Man) Come in. Hi. Hi, Tommy. I'm Matthew Letter. Welcome to Pinehurst. Have a seat. Sit down, son. I'll tell you a little about Pinehurst, then we'll let you get settled. How's that sound? Tommy? How does that sound? Sure. All right. About Pinehurst, you'll find we're very different from the state institution. We don't have any guards here. Nobody tells you what to do. - Basically, you're your own boss. - It's an honour system. What you're really doing here, Tommy, is... preparing yourself to re-enter society and start a new life. Pam, wanna point Tommy toward his room and get him started? Sure. OK? Go through the kitchen, up the stairs, and it's the first door on your left, OK? See you in a bit. - What do you think? - The kid's a real talker. I noticed. How'd they diagnose it? "Severe trauma at age 12. "Brutal self-defence murder of a psychopathic killer." They've given him every treatment, every therapy they can think of. It's a wonder his mind isn't fried with all the drugs. (Gasps) (Laughter) You scared of spiders? You scared of rubber spiders? You scared of rubber spiders on strings? Man, you are one scared cat. Where I come from, you learn to be scared of nothing. They call me Reggie the Reckless. No spider scares me. - (Roars) - Joke, man! Don't. Don't get all twisted out of shape. You act like you made these things. I did. Solid. So you're the new nut? - Is that what they call us? - "Us"? I ain't one of you. I'm just visiting. My granddaddy works here. (Siren) Gotta split. Catch you later. There's action. Joey, come on. Hurry up. Oh, my God! Whoo! Hey, you guys! Joey, come on. Stop, Grandpa! Come on. Don't! - Hey, Matt. How's it going? - All right. What's up? Well, Matt, it's like we talked about. You got some neighbours who aren't happy about your place. Now, I respect what you're trying to do, Matt, I do. But we found a couple of your kids on the Hubbard place again. - Deputy! - Sir! - Bring 'em out. - Yes, sir. Everybody out. Stop fooling around. Fall in. - Yes, sir. - Move, wise guy. We found them in Hubbard's woods screwing their heads off, Matt. We're lucky this time, because Ethel didn't see them. I'll take care of it, Sheriff. (Motorbike approaches) I'll do the talking. Keep quiet. Morning, Ethel. - Don't you look lovely? - Horseshit! Sheriff, you better hear me good. I want this loony bin closed down. You hear? Now, these kids ain't nothing but trouble! They disrespect property, and they're all crazy! You tell 'em, Ma! - These kids weren't doing... - Doin'? You think I don't know what those two perverts were doing in my yard?! - Say it like you mean it, Ma! - Would you shut the fuck up? (Kids laugh) Now, I'll tell all of you. You mark my words, the next bastard comes near my farm, I'll blow your fucking brains out. You hear? Don't you come near me, Sheriff, I warn you. I've got a bomb on me. I swear to you! Make one move toward me, I'm gonna blow us all up. Start the engines, Junior. - (Revs engine) - That's it. My final words. OK, people, let's go. Party's over. She's really something, ain't she? Seriously, try to keep your kids off her property. I will. I understand you got the Jarvis kid today. - He arrived earlier. - And? - And what? - What's he like? He's like any other kid. He's just... he's been through a lot. Yeah. Well, good luck with him, pal. Thanks a lot, Sheriff. (Grunting) - Hi, girls. - Hi, Joey. - Hi, Violet. - Huh? Hi! - What are you doing? - Laundry, Joey. Can I help? I'm really very good at laundry. Matt never assigns it to me. Look, Joey, we have to get this finished, OK? So I'm here to help you. You can count on me, Rob. You too, Vi. Want a chocolate bar? Here, you want it? - I'll give you half. - Piss off! Please let me help you. It's no prob... (Both gasp) Joey! - Get out of here! - Fuck! I'm sorry. I can do laundry great. But, well, if that's how you feel, forget it. I'll just go help somebody else instead. I'll see you later. Listen, if you change your mind... - Joey! - Joey! (Rob) Jesus, what a loser. - Hi, Vic! - Get lost. Don't be like that. Let me help you with the wood today. And anyway, I got two chocolate bars, see? Don't tell the girls. What an asshole. You know, Vic, before I came here, I never had anything to do, me being an orphan and all. People always teased me about sitting round like some kind of pig. But here, it's different. I can help others and do a lot of things. You know something? I really love it here. I hate it! You know, to be honest with you, I never chopped wood before, but it certainly looks like fun. Leave me alone! (Panting) Here, Vic. Want a bite? Here, I'll just put it over here and you can have it later. Well, if that's the way you feel, forget it, Vic! Just forget it! But I think you're really out of line. (Roars) (Joey screams) (Screams) We got a homicide on our hands. See what you've got on a Faden. Victor J Faden. F-A-D-E-N. Thanks, Harry. (Girl sobbing) Is there someone we should notify? As far as I know, there's no immediate family. His mother died while giving birth. I don't know about the father - took off somewhere, I guess. The kid got shuffled from home to home until he came here. He was a good kid. I know, Matt. So...what have we got here? (Kids all gasp and sob) Bunch of pussies. (Chuckles) Come on, Roy. Get your hands dirty. Pete, this is bullshit! This really sucks! Just fix it! Those cunts won't wait forever. Oh, fuck! This is a mess. No way, I refuse to do this. You're always fucking around with this, so get up and fix it! You understand? Pete! (Horn honks) You are an asshole! What's the matter, Vinnie? You all creeped out by that murder at the nuthouse? As far as I'm concerned, all those loonies should be killed off one by one. Can you try it now? (Engine stalls) Jesus! Can't you do anything? Stop screwing around! Get this done by the time I get back. I gotta take a crap. - Crap, my ass! - Just do it, man! I mean it. Fucking asshole! (Leaves rustling and twigs snapping) Oh, you little fuck. What are you doing, douchebag? Enough, already. You can stop. Would you cut it out? Pete! All right, either you got the car started or you're a dead man. ? A rat-a-tat-tat tat tooey ? A rat-a-tat-tat ? A rat-a-tat-tat tat tooey ? A rat-a-tat-tat ? ? This ain't starting, man. You fucked up again. ? I'm gonna kick your ass, kick your ass ? Come on everybody, this ain't startin' ? ? Come on, motherfucker, fix the fucking car! ? Come on. You fucked up again, you asshole! ? What you doing up there, Vinnie? ? You're a dirty... ? A rat-a-tat-tat tat tooey ? - (Engine starts) - Whoo! All right. And we're off. Let's go! (Horn honking) (Heart beating) (Man) Die! - Die! - (Woman) Tommy! - Die! - Tommy! Die! Die! (Heart beating faster) Die! Die! Die! (Woman) Tommy! Die! - Tommy! - Die! - Die! - Oh... Die! Die! Die! There you go. - Gramps. - What is it, son? Can I go see my brother tomorrow? We'll see. You know how I feel about that. - But Gramps... - I said we'll see, Reggie. (Sighs) Hey, come here, Reggie the Reckless. Do me a favour, don't kiss me when there's people around, OK? OK, it's cool. Go and let everyone know breakfast is ready. Yo! Breakfast! Come and get it! I could've done that. I-I m-m-miss Joey already. So do I. I-I hope Victor gets what's c-coming to him. Morning, everybody. (All) Morning. Violet, you set too many places. Huh? I said, you set too many places. - No, I didn't! - Yes, you did! Victor and Joey won't be here this morning, Violet. Or any other morning. - Reggie! - Oh, God. I'm sorry. Y-y-you don't s-s-set a place for a dead person. I said I was sorry! What's going on here? Look... I know how you all feel. This thing is not easy... for any of us. So let's just have breakfast. (Rob) I'm sorry, Violet. - Where's Eddie? - He's upstairs. Tommy... would you mind telling Eddie to come downstairs? Tommy? Would you mind? Yeah, all right. (Roars) (Laughter) (Violet) Asshole. Relax, Chief. What's wrong, no sense of humour? Can't you take a joke? (Yells) It's all right, Tommy! It's gonna be all right. Just relax. Yeah. It's gonna be just fine. I'm gonna chop you into itty-bitty little pieces, my friend. Just like they done to that piggo over at that fucking crazy farm. (Squeals) (Squeals and chuckles) You big dildo. Eat your fucking slop. Ain't I make the best goddam stew in the world? Best goddam stew in the world! (Chickens clucking) It's that goddam coyote, trying to kill my lot again. I'll show that bastard once and for all, Junior. Holy shit! Who the fuck are you and what the fuck do you want? I'd like to earn a meal. Yeah? What do you do? Whatever you need done. OK. Clean all the shit out of the chicken coop and dump it behind the shed. You come back here after that and I'll fill your stomach. Yes, ma'am. That is one fucking ugly man that goes there. One fucking ugly man, Mama. Would you shut your trap?! You ain't so pretty yourself, you know. I ain't so pretty myself, I know. (Slurping) (Squeals) I want every inch of this area combed thoroughly. Bring back anything you find. Anything. - Get going. - Yes, sir. What the hell's going on here? You talking to me, Sheriff? Huh? I thought you was talking to me. No, Roy. It's OK. Go ahead. Get them out of here. Looks like we got us a maniac on the loose, huh, Sheriff? (Horn honking) (Man) Lana! Hey, Lana! Sorry, buster. We're closed. It's OK, I just want a take-out order. - You do, huh? - Yeah. What would you like? I'd like Lana to go with nothing on. Oh? And who wants her? The pride of the Unger Institute of Mental Health, who's dumped his last bedpan and would like very much to party. Lana, hmm... I don't know, I'll have to ask her. Hey, Lana. You want Billy? You sure? She wants you, too. But you'll have to wait till she's done. Yahoo! There. I'm going to party. (Giggling) It's... show time! (Laughs) (Radio playing rock music) That's it. (Burbles) That's it. That's the whole fucking thing right there. There it is. You just stay right there, doll. That's just what the doctor ordered. A little preventive medicine. And the forecast is... cloudy in the mountains, sunny in the valleys, and snow flurries up your nose. (Sniffs) (Coughs) Mmm. ? I don't know if he loves me ? But I think he does... ? (Glass breaks) Billy? Girl, you are so hot. (Chuckles) (Cat screeches) (Miaows) - (Honks horn) - Hey, Lana! What the fuck is she doing? - Hey! - (Honks horn) Jesus Christ! Come on, will you? Lana! Hey! Hey! (Grunts) Bad kitty. You bad kitty. I don't like you any more. I feed you, I love you and you scare me like that. Go on, kitty. Sorry. Billy? Billy, what are you doing? It's cold. This is cute. I like this... a whole lot(!) (Sighs) You'll waste a lot of money this way, smartie. Oh, well, that just means more for me. Oh. Yummy. Oh, my God. Billy! Billy! (Sobbing) (Gasps) (Squealing) (Heart beating) (Man) I don't care if you have to arrest your mother! Get me the goddam psycho who's responsible for this mess. I mean, shit, Tucker, what the hell's going on here? I mean, this is a small town, man. And small towns are supposed to be safe. I know who it is. What? I said, I know who it is. Who? It's Jason Voorhees. Jason Voorhees? You're out of your mind! You've been in the sun too long. Jason is dead! His body was cremated. He's nothing but a handful of ash. You know that for sure, Mayor? Did you see him cremated? Jason Voorhees. I can't believe this! Here, this is your Jason Voorhees. Here. This. Your ass is on the line here, Tucker. Are you getting that? You get me a goddam live suspect! (Muffled screams) You fuck! You really scared me. You loved it. You want more? Eddie, we can't. - Matt will kill us. - Fuck him. Fuck you. Exactly. Fuck me. Come on. - Come on. - (Giggles) (Squealing) Whoa! Yee-ha! Watch the dirt. Watch the dirt. (Whooping) Whoa! - What? - Wait. Especially for the occasion. (Giggles) (Heavy breathing) (Giggling) (Both) Mm... (Both moaning) (Cawing) - I'll go wash up. - OK, sugar. Ohh. Mmm... - Hurry back. - I'm hurrying. Oh... (Birds chirping) (Sighing) (Crunching) I'm back. What is this? Sleeping? Hey. (Gasps) (Grunts) (Yelling) (Screaming) (Caws) - Let's get this show on the road! - Wait a minute, I'm coming. I just don't understand it. Reggie, I want you to be a good kid with Pam. She's doing us both a great favour. If she ever gets here. Don't go getting into trouble with Demon. All right! Yo, Pam! Come on! Tina and Eddie will show up when they get hungry, so stop worrying. I'm not worried any more. I'm just pissed. Well, stop it. Take Tommy with you. It'll probably do him good to get away. Yeah, that's a good idea. Tommy! Pam's taking Reggie to see his brother tonight. - Why don't you go too? - Great idea. Now, let's go. Go see what you can do, huh? OK. Tommy! Tommy. Come on. It'll be fun. OK? Good. (Engine starts) (Truck drives away) - Come on. - No. I'll wait here. - Come on. - I'm OK. (Knock on door) (Reggie) Yo, Demon! - Is that the big bad wolf? - Yeah. Open up! - That you, Reckless? - Open up! Oh, my God! Well, get your ass in here, boy! God, it's to good see you! Damn, you look good! I know, I know. Oh, God. Look at this. You had any dinner? Here. Have an enchilada. Man... Wow! Where'd you get those rings? You been around this long, you get things. Freaking A! Where'd you get that? Calm down, dude. Say hello to Anita. She's my girlfriend. - Hello, beautiful. - Hey, little brother. I want you all to meet somebody. Hey, Pam! Yo, Pam. Come here, baby, come here. - This is my friend Pam. - Hi. She's my girlfriend. What's up, Pam? (Sign buzzing) - Pam, you hungry? - No. Want a taco? What about a slice of pizza? - No. - Cheese and sausage. What about you, brother? You want a beer? - Yeah. - Get out of here. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna let you take this. Wow! Man, this is bad! Nothing's too good for my brother. - Gonna give me this, too? - (Laughs) (Sign buzzing) (Heart beating) (Motorbike approaching) (Laughing) I got you, didn't I? Really scared you, didn't I? Are you dumb or something? You're a crazy from the loony bin! My mama's going to chop you up into itty-bitty pieces, my friend! You hear me? I said, are you hearing me? I said, are you hearing me?! Fuck you, lunatic! (Yelling) (Screams) (Moaning) (Yelling and gasping) (Yells) Tommy! (Groans) - (Howls) - Reggie, we've got to go now. OK, bro. Take care. Thanks for the dinner. - Anytime. - Stay cool, baby. Hey, stay safe, Reckless! I will! - You know, I miss him already. - Yeah, he's a cutie pie. - Want to hit this? - Yeah. - (Groans) - What's wrong? - (Groans) - Hey, you OK? It's them damn enchiladas. - (Moans) - You gonna be all right? (Groaning) (Moaning) Who's that? Stop it! Stop it! (Laughing) You're gonna get it, bitch! Lighten up, Demon. You'll feel a lot better after you shit. I'll feel a lot better when I'm out of here. This shit box is gross! Watch out for snakes. They'll crawl up and bite your ass. ? Ooh, baby ? Hey, baby ?

G-George, too. - Are you sure? - I l-looked. And Tina and Eddie haven't come back. - W-W-Where are they? - It's OK. Calm down, Jake. Let's take this slowly. Where did Matt say he was going? - He didn't. - Yes, he did. He went looking for Tina and Eddie. W-Where's Tommy? Wasn't he with you? - And where's Gramps? - I don't know, Reggie. Why don't you all go inside? I'm gonna go find everyone. - Jake, I'm putting you in charge. - Yes. And you, Reckless, I want you in bed asleep when I get back, right? No problem. OK. (Starts engine) (Yelling) I'm making your dinner, Junior! You hearing me, fella? He hurt me, Ma! He hurt me! (Yelling) I am making your dinner! (Yelling continues) He hurt me, Ma! Will you murder 'em?! Chop 'em and kill 'em?! Do you hear me? Get off that fucking bike and come here and eat my stew! (Screaming) (Clattering outside) (Door shuts) About time, you fuckwad. I knew you couldn't pass up my stew. You hearing me, Junior? You talk. You dumb? (Engine clanks) (Engine chugging, not turning over) (Thunder rumbling) It's so lonely here. Like we were the only two people left. Maybe we are. Maybe when we get back, everybody will have disappeared. I'd like that, wouldn't you? Robin... W-We've b-been here nearly, uh, eight months now, right? Uh-huh. T-T-That's a long time to get to know somebody. - Shh-shh. Jake, please. - Shh. Shh. We could go anywhere, and live in the biggest house in the world. Only, I'd live in a little house, just big enough for the two of us. Only there'll be more than two of us. (? Dramatic music) I l-like you, Robin... A lot. I like you, too, Jake. You do? A lot? What are you talking about, Jake? Uh... I-I-I want to be with you. I-I r-r-really do want to be with you. I-I-I w-want to m-m-m-m... make love with you. (Laughing) I can't... I-I-I didn't mean it. I...I-I-I didn't mean it. I-I said I... I didn't mean it! (Thunder crashes) V-Vi? V-V-Vi! (Stereo blaring) - Vi, I-I'd l-like to talk to you. - Huh? I n-need to talk to you! Can it wait? No. (Thunderclap) Reggie. Reggie? Come on. Reggie, wake up. - (Groans) - It's time to go to bed. Reggie, wake up. Reggie! (Sighs) OK, your way. (Sighs) Jake... I'm sorry. You know, sometimes, Robin, you are just so stupid. (Thunder crashes) (Screams) (Gasping) (Choked scream) (Stereo blaring) ? There was a man so cold ? No life was in his eyes ? He had a look so hard ? I've never seen him smile ? (Door shuts) ? He'll love you more therefore ? And now you're in suspense ? You have to wait for more ? In those old mysteries ? You're taken by surprise ? You never thought to see ? That look was in his eyes ? There's a man with no life in his eyes ? There's a man with no life in his eyes ? (Gasps) (Screams) (Thunder crashes) What are them nuts up to now? Yo, Tommy. You back? Tommy, you in here? (Knock on door) Yo, Tommy! - (Screams) - What is it, Reggie? What's the matter? What's the matter? It's me! What is it? What is it?! I-In Tommy's room! OK, all right. You stay here. Relax. I'll be right back, OK? (Thunder crashes) (Pam screams) (Sobbing) Move! - (Yells) - Get up! Get up! (Screaming) Shit! Run! Come on! Let's go! Help us! Reggie! Reggie! (Sobbing) (Yells) Pam, where are you?! Pam! Reggie! Reggie! (Screams) (Sobbing) Reggie! Reggie! Reggie?! (Screams) (Screaming) (Yelling) (Screams) (Sobbing and grunting) (Screaming) (Pam coughs) Oh, it's OK, Reggie. It's OK. It's OK. God. (Wailing) Oh, God. (Both scream) (Thunder rolls) (Clattering) (Clunking) (Buzzing) Yeah! All right! Yeah! Yeah! (Chainsaw stops) (Grunting) Tommy! Tommy! (Heart beating) Run, Tommy, run! Run! He'll kill you! - Jason? - Listen to me! Run! Go! Tommy, get out! - Jason? - Get out! Listen! Oh, Tommy, go! (Woman) Tommy! (Man, whispering) Remember. Don't. (Heart beating) (Man) Remember. (2nd man) Die! - Remember. - Die! - Jason. - Remember, remember. Jason. - Remember, remember, remember... - Tommy! Tommy! (Yells) (Tommy gasping) (Screams) (Pam) Up here, Tommy! Up here!

(Heavy breathing) (Pam gasping) - No! - (Roars) (Screaming) Please! Please, somebody help me! Pam! (Reggie screaming) How are you doing? (Tucker) Quite a kid. We found this on Roy. The kid who was axed at the wood pile was Roy's son. God only knows why Roy kept it hidden all these years, but he did. Roy was a real loner. Never talked much, not even to the other paramedics. I guess when he was called to the scene, and saw his own Joey all hacked to pieces... We also found these. I guess he used the Jason thing to...cover up with. Tommy. Hi. (Roaring) (Cackling) (Yells) (Thunder rolling) (Inhales) (Footsteps outside) (Glass smashes) Oh, my God.
