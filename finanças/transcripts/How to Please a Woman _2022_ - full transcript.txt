Loneliness Blast it. Who's got the vinegar? Yep. Well, I need something. It's really stinging. You should wee on it. I don't think I could manage the angle. I could. No, thanks. It's fine. Oh, go on, give us a shot. I don't want you to wee on me. So, what do you want for your birthday? To not be having another birthday. All right, gotta go. I've got to be at work by eight. Oh, I thought you had the day off today. Yeah, that turned into a half day off. Happy birthday me! Mm. Bye. Bye. Do you think she suspects anything? Happy birthday, Mum. Thanks. So you're old enough to retire now, right? Ha-ha, Chloe. There's no way they can cope without me. I can't even get a full day off. And is Dad spoiling you? Oh, he will, don't you worry. Oh, it's just started snowing here. London is so amazing. I can't believe I had to grow up in Australia. Thanks, Dad. Oh, Mum, hey, sorry, I've got to go. Oh. But have a great birthday. Already? Oh. Love you. Bye, Dad. Bye, honey. She seems happy. I hope that doesn't mean she's gonna stay. Of course she's happy. She's having a great time ignoring her studies. Just stop that, please. I love this stuff! Oh. Lack of food waste, high nutrition profile and portion control. It's so good you're doing it. Wanna open that? Go on, spoil yourself. Happy birthday. Lovely. Now, can we go? I've got court first thing. Sorry. Hey, I hope you don't mind, but I've just very quickly separated out the ones that don't qualify for business recovery. Dina! Thanks. I'm under the pump on that, um... removers there. "Pleased To Move You." We need to file for insolvency like yesterday. Got it. Where's the rest of it? Er, left it on-site. So could you... I'm really busy right now. I was due to finish at lunch time today, and I do have a client report to finalise. It will only take you a minute. Gina? Thanks. I - that's - yeah. Hello? Hello? Whoa! Hey, hey, Ben! Sorry. Ben, watch where you're going. Did you get your driver's licence on the dark net? You're really gonna have to learn how to reverse in here. I don't like reversing. It's easy. It's like going forwards, except backwards. Can't even do that. We've been waiting for someone to show up. I just came to get a file that my colleague left behind. Tea? Biscuit? Oh, er, well, no. I'm actually on a bit of a - well, it's a diet box. He makes his own ginger snaps. Kinda chewy in the middle, but just the right amount of bite in the bite. If you don't mind, I'll just collect the paperwork. You have no idea what you're missing out on. I don't know what file you're talking about. Well, I can see it. It's just - Oh, you're the one that's gonna shut us down. Oh, no. I just do the organising and the things that other people forget to do like bringing such paperwork back to the office. You know, if you file that today, we're all out. Boys are owed money. Will see none of it. I'm really not the person who makes those decision. I just need the paperwork. Well, you can't have it. If you don't let me have the paperwork, I can't tell if we're able to help. What, you can help us? I love a good spreadsheet. Well... you won't like this one. I wonder what she means by loving a spreadsheet. Gina. I think you must have the wrong Gina. Er, Gina Henderson? Yes. Um... Happy birthday. Er, stop that. Now, please. Please. Don't you like it? Oh, no, you're very good. Just... Please. Are you sure you want me to stop? I-I'm sorry. Um... I don't think you understand. I'm your birthday present. Well, could you put that back on, please? And re-buckle your belt. Well, you've got me for two hours. Two hours? How long does it take you to get undressed? Well, I undress the way you want me to undress. And then I'll do anything that you want me to do. Anything. I'm very open-minded. Anything? Totally. Really? Completely. Do you think you could clean my house? What? Well, you said... anything. Yeah, not that. You said you'd do whatever I wanted. No way, man. This is a prepaid service, right? So I think that's a contract in sales terms. Come on. Are you sure you wouldn't just... rather I just take my clothes off? I'm married. It doesn't stop most people. Could you start by doing the floor? Pony You're enjoying this. I'm not. It's not illegal to look, you know? Here, let me show you. You can't just rub away at it and hope for the best. You have to... be gentle. Yeah. So-so go in circles. Not so fast. Slowly. Start gently. Circles. That's your two hours. Yep. Thanks. Um, it was, er, so not my pleasure. Happy birthday. Oh, yep. I'll, um... I'll let myself out. Yeah. They want me to be equity partner. Why didn't you say? I'm telling you now. Didn't wanna jinx it. That's fantastic. You've worked so hard. You'll be perfect. I've never slept with a senior partner before. Honey... I've got a bit of a headache. Can you get the light? Good night. So... was he gorgeous? Thank you very much, everyone, for the sex worker you sent to my home address. Come on, you sly dog. No, no, I-I paid for the premium version. They said if you get that, you can have anything you want. I... Oh, my God. So, what did you ask for? I asked him to clean my house. What? What was I supposed to do? Thank you for thinking of me, but if I want that I'll find it in my own marriage. Farley was fantastic for that, I'll have you know. Farley was over a year ago. Some things happen in their own time. Yeah, no, I mean, she's right, guys. It's not like any of us singles are getting any. Apart from you, of course, Hayley. It does. It sounds amazing, actually, having a man clean your house. Did he have a six-pack? Oh, please tell me he at least took his shirt off. Did he? It was a four-pack. Oh, yes! Yes, Gina! Whoo! Brett, I was looking at those removals figures and I think we're missing a bit of, um... It's just fatty tissue. Sorry. So, um, I thought... Oh. You know you haven't remembered my birthday for five years. There was a restructure. My hands were tied. I'm sorry. You'll get picked up straight away. There will be some sort of package. Who else did you let go? Just yourself at present. Here's your copies. Now I'm almost done reconfiguring the report system, and you need to get a social strategist. Can I get you something, Gina? Yeah, you can take your double D cups and you can piss off back to your own department. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Do you think she's OK? OK. I've got you a little cheer up present. Oh... Now, it is a remote-controlled internal vibrator. So you wear it inside. Oh, I... No. It's movement controlled, Bluetooth enabled. It's amazing. I... No, no, no. I've got one. It was a buy one, get one free so this is for you. Well, that-that is so lovely of you to think of me. No, I didn't think of you. I was gonna give it to one of the others, but clearly it has to be you. Why? Why me? Because you're gonna be stuck at home by yourself all day, so got to have something to do. OK. Uh, hi. I think I left the speaker. The bastards wanna charge me 200 bucks for what's like a... 50-dollar speaker, so... Do you mind if I...? No, come in. Thanks. Nah. I was a shit stripper. Didn't even make it past my trial week. I thought you were great. You don't recognise me, do you? From the moving company. You're from 'Please To Move You'? Well, no, not anymore. No. Now we're folding. So that's two jobs I've lost in one week. But I read the file. That's not necessary. There are things you can do to turn that around. Well, tell that to the dickheads who decided we're not worth saving. Oh, sorry. Ah! Ah. 200 bucks right there - that's... What I could - I mean, have you thought about doing other work? Yeah. Cleaning? Cleaning? No, I can't. Ah, so you'll take your clothes off for strangers, but God forbid if you have to clean a woman's house. I've just got to get back and help fix the truck so they can sell it. Ah. Yeah, I'm not the only one out of work. You know, there's four of us. Ah. But thanks. House cleaners? I've never cleaned a house before. It's gross. Possibly shirtless cleaning. If-if that's what the clients want. Uh, I don't think that's gonna work out so well for all of us. What about the removals? Oh, we'll do them. Just if you don't get enough removals bookings, you'll have to clean. And what about the shirt business? Optional extra, billable. Tom, what do you have to say about your experience as a stripper? Mate, you stripped? Yeah, I only did it for a little bit. Did you feel exploited? I loved it. You must have been pretty shit. Fuck off, I was all right. How do you know about him being a stripper? Oh, er, my friends booked him as a surprise... surprise, uh, present. I just think there are a lot of women who really like the thought of a man cleaning their house, shirtless on request. And I think they'll pay for it. Is that all right with everyone? Gina. I would like to make an offer on the removals company 'Pleased To Move You'. We closed them down. We do offer counselling, you know that. You didn't close them. I did. Only, um, I didn't. I decided they qualify for business recovery. Gina, that place is history. And you can smell it on them and the manager's like... 50. I can't give you a company. Yes, you can if it's not worth anything. Hm, it's not that it's worth nothing. The company has assets - you know, client base, corporate knowledge. Truck, if I recall. But I don't have any money yet. Not on my own. The creditors need 10% of assets so if you can find a way to come up with that, it could be yours. Could I pay in instalments? I'd need a commission. Gina, that is so brave. True god. You frickin' nailed it. Where'd you find your cleaners? Actually it's the, uh, stripper you got me for my birthday. The one with the four-pack? The very same. Hm. You still here? Brett let me go. There was a restructure. He had to. Were you the only one? Yep. That's not a restructure. That's age discrimination. That's a problem. We can pursue that. I wouldn't worry about it. I'm setting up a different business. What kind of business? Removals. Removals? Gina, do you know what you're getting into? It's fine. We already have the - Is this some kind of scheme? Cos you know this pyramid selling business - some of them are just a scam. It's perfectly fine. I'm just helping them diversify their service base. Into what? What? What? Listen, it's the first day and I'm-I'm-I'm late. Yeah, just gotta, mm, run. You remember how to clean with a microfibre? S shape. What's a microfibre again? OK, just ask her how she'd like her house cleaned. I'm sure she'll tell you. Can I ask you, what did you like when I was cleaning? Cos I didn't know what I was doing, so... any pointers would be great. Uh... Well, you were good at the skirting boards. No, no, like... what did you like? Oh! Er, do you remember what you did with your shirt? I took it off. Yeah. And? You put it in your back pocket. Yeah, you could maybe try that again. Oh. Um, and, you know, leave it there. Yeah, no problem. Should I do the introductions for you? No, no, no, I've got it, I've got it. Yeah, I'm just gonna stay here. All right. All right. OK. Elbow grease. Yeah. I've come to clean your house. Good. Great. Um, do you wanna start in here? Sorry. You're gonna have to tell me how to do some of this. Oh. Oh. So, uh, where next? Kitchen. Yeah. Just... Thomas? Yeah. Sorry, can I call you Tom? Yeah. Tom, would you mind taking your boots off, please? Yes. Sorry. Whoo. That is not happening ever again. Sure thing, boss. Tom. I got a promotion. I have a boyfriend. I brought ice cream. I'm off dairy, Tom. Oh. Um, are you off... Chocolate Obsession? Damn you. So, um... is everything going OK? With the - with the baby? Is it going OK? He is fine. Kicking like a bastard. He? Yeah. Bye, Tom. Yeah. Bye. He. Hello? Hi, I was wondering if I could make a booking for one of those house cleaners, please? Yes. Yes. I'm sorry, it's so noisy in here. When would you like? Sometime on Thursday. OK. Sorry, can - I - can you say that again? Um, hi. Oh. Excuse me. Are you the one with the service? Yes, I am. Can you just give me a couple of minutes? I'm just taking a booking. I must have this house cleaner. Oh. I've heard it's very good. I hear he leaves no surface untouched, gets into every crevice. So I was wondering if you had any availability on Thursday. Excuse me. No, I'll take Thursday. You did so good! You know it's just for cleaning, right? I want what she had. Yeah, sorry, but cleaning is just a cover. That was a mistake. That-That is not gonna happen again. Would anyone like to book a straight-up cleaning job? Wanna get drunk? I have vodka. No. You'll get another job. It won't be that hard. Don't lie to me. OK, because you're over 50 it's gonna be very hard. I know. Oh, I'm not gonna do it. Why not? I couldn't ask those men to do that. Actually, I think he was the one who offered. I just couldn't. Oh, God. You're so... British. What does that mean? This is a very good idea. You're being so uptight. Sorry. Shh-shh. Does anyone still want to make a booking? Well, for cleaning or for sex? Both. Obviously you don't have to if you don't want to. And, um, I have prepared a whole redundancy package for each of you. That perhaps is the other option. And if we want to? Well, then, you just go right ahead. And you just ask your client if she'd prefer to have her house cleaned before or after. Oh. Don't look at me. Well, then you could just do the housework. Business as usual. Well, uh, so... right, so, um... quality control. Um, obviously the cleaning must be effective, and there must be a minimum of one orgasm. You've thought of everything. Do we count our own? If we count hers and mine, that's two, right? That's a multiple? Yours is irrelevant. Is she serious? I think she is. I'm down for it. It will be like career enhancement. Dude, you can't hold down a job to save your life. You can't even keep a driver's license. It wasn't my fault. It's never your fault. What if you don't like her? Your client? Gina was pretty clear. If you don't like anything about the session, you can leave it. Or what if she doesn't like us? When I did my stripping week, that was the worst bit. You can be like really well-built. If you're a stripper, you can't just be a bit hot. You have to be smoking. If we're gonna sleep with people, we'll have to be sex gods. Sounds good. I'm in. Are you kidding? I'm in. Steve? I'll be your IT department, at least to get you started. I found this site. Oh. Jesus. Is that shit even legal? Yeah, that stripper joint I worked for did that, but they had some kind of a special licence. Apparently took them ages to get it. Yeah, I've heard, but we need to get started. So if we did a website like this, could we make the site owner anonymous? Yeah, but you still need search engine optimisation with the right search words. So, housecleaning. Sex. Pleasure. You should be jotting this down. Escorts who love your home. Um, integrity, safety. Discretion. Rock-solid. Best ever root you'll get all year. I thought we were all going round. Yeah, integrity's good. Hi. Hi. Come in. Thank you. Right on time. Foto Viva. Tom? Would you like to dance? Yeah. Sure thing. Just stop that. It's fine. Ah. Um, so I've been thinking. And... You see, I'm just not exactly sure that I can reliably say that I know how to please... a woman. Well... if you can say that... ..you're a better man than most. Good. What, Anthony? So-So he's big. A jackhammer? Oh. Oh, I am... very sorry. Yes, of course, I completely understand. Can we make it up to you in some way? Very sorry once again. Back to cleaning and removals, bro. On my hot mother, I swear. Pleased to Move You. Really? Oh, that's just basic. What else did he miss? Dude. Oh, he'll be back. I understand. No charge. Come on, fellas. Don't feel bad. We all make mistakes. Let's look at the positives here. At least you're both in the shit. I mean, it's not like you're gonna sack them. One of my members of staff is... How shall I put this? He's, um... very... well... Endowed? Oh, God. God's gift. Yeah, he needs help from someone who knows more than him. Someone very... very experienced. Guys. Just be cool. Just be cool. Could you teach him to clean everything? Nothing sexy. Just-just cleaning. Everything. Thoroughly. Uh, because I am chairing a board meeting at three. Oh, yeah. He will so be done by then. It's just your place - it's the perfect training ground. Mm. OK. Keep your clothes on. Are you sure it will be good? The cleaning? The sex. Of course. What if he doesn't like me? Why do you think he would like you? It's been a little while since I've, um... Ah. Now like quite a few years. That happens. Quite a few. Can we just stop? Stop. OK. Did you learn everything you know from watching porn? Porn is the exact opposite of what good sex feels like for women. Has no one ever told you that? No. Oh, God. Um... Uh, you just tell me what I'm doing wrong and I will listen. You don't just listen with your ears. You listen with your body. Now, every woman's body is different. So even if I teach you a technique, you still have to listen each time. Mm. What do you have to do every single time? Have to, um, listen to your body with my body. So I'm pretty successful at work, in pretty much everything in life, except one thing. Let me guess. Yeah, well, let's just say that not all of my sexual experiences have been enjoyable. You don't have to do this if you don't want to. No, I've thought about it a lot. I don't want a relationship and I don't like the idea of an online hook-up, and I've realised that I don't wanna give up on sex forever, so... Well, you can take it gently. You could, like, start with... ..a foot rub, and then move onto a little massage, and then just see if you want to take it any further. Can we do that? Sure. Glass of wine? W-What do you like to drink? Gin. I might have to slam a few first to forget myself to get started. You know, I think you are here to remember yourself. Yeah. Thanks. You know what? Yeah, I'll just do it. Oh. Not very good at letting other people do things for you, are you? Er, we need a different cloth. Yep, I'll get it. No, no, it's fine. What does your husband do? Er, did you mean to ask what do I do? I'm a corporate lawyer. He is a surgeon. Good with his hands? He used to be. I'm sorry. I didn't realise he's not around. Oh, no, no, no. He is around. It's just that we don't... Oh. ..you know, kind of... Um, you can start on the bath. Yeah. Yeah. It's OK. The same with my girlfriend, or my ex. We stopped, as well. Was that just because it wasn't very good? Oh, no, no, it was great. But it was always up to me. I always had to initiate. The thing is, um... Well, we are having a baby. Congratulations. Yeah. Well, she's having a baby without me. Little man. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, I wish she'd let me be the dad. I am the dad. I just really wanna be the dad. I think I have to grow up a bit. I need to get my shit together. I'm sure you will. You'll get there. Yeah. If I am paying for it, I don't want ordinary orgasm. I can sort one of those out for myself. And I don't one of those naughty ones that sneak up on you and then fizzle out. I want orgasm with lots of edging. Eased towards it... then back off. Ease up to it again... ..then back off. You know. A big... delicious lead up, and then... ..total annihilation. OK. And anything else? Snow angel. My all-time go to favourite. That can't be comfortable. I don't know. Looks all right for her. Bloke's got quite a hard job, though. She is upside down. No, she's just lying back. He's the one doing all the holding. No, no, that is definitely upside down. She can't even move. Stop looking. I was just going to do the... license... ..application. Women are quite tricky to please. They all seem to say completely different things. It's very inconsistent. You're terrible for you. I'm really not sure I'm cut out for this. Close your eyes. That's silly. No, no, trust me. Just close your eyes and imagine you're a woman about to contact this business. Come on, come on. All right. You heard about the company... Mm-hm... and you're intrigued. Why are you so interested? I, uh... I don't know why. I just am. Can't help it. I don't even want to be. So what do you do about it? I look it up... ..secretly. And? I need to know I'm talking to a woman. I don't want to speak to a man about this. Good. So you call up, you get a woman and she asks you what you want. What you really want. Maybe she just wants to be touched. Feel this. What does it tell you? You're trying to teach me something. That's what my words are saying. Feel my hand. What's it telling you? It's warm. Go on. It's like... It's like you're inviting me some. Pleased to see me. Good. Good. Now we can start. So, what did you mean by, you know, it was always up to you? Oh, yeah. Well, even before we broke up we'd stopped having sex. I really love it when a woman initiates, and she never would. It's so hot when a woman asks me for something. Could you get that dark blue cloth, please? OK, sure. So... ..what would you like to do for dinner? I would like you to take me out. Mm. And after that... ..I'd like to skip dessert. I think that we should come straight home... and have a nude swim. And then... ..I would like to lie down on one of the sun lounges and... I would like you to go down on me. And if you like... ..I could return the favour. Could we skip dinner? Yeah, nah. I wanna be taken out first. Gina? Gina? What's the occasion? I'll make us some pasta. You said I never helped with the housework. Tom, no. Well, I can do it now. Top to bottom. Let me show you. No, it's OK. You must be Tom. I'm Gary. How's the little man? Growing. Um... Nice to meet you, mate. We're fine. Don't worry. I'll call you. See ya. Bye, Tom. Dorian Hi. Wait. Wait. Wait. I-I know how to clean your place properly now. From top to bottom. And if you don't let me in and let me do it, I might lose my job. Please, please, please. Please let me come in and clean. I couldn't quite hear that last bit. Could you just repeat that? (CHUCKLES Please, please, please let me come in and clean your house. Thank you. Are they? I had actually forgotten... ..how good my body can feel. Hang on, Sandra. I'm pleased for you because this business... Pleased To Move You. Could you please hold? Sometimes you just need several great Chads to get your mojo back. I can't remember ever feeling this good. Hello. This is Steve. I don't usually answer these phones. Um... so please be gentle with me. It's just unbelievable. Mm. Gina, I cannot recommend it highly enough. I just... I feel so alive. Are you there? Um, yeah, we can do that. Would you mind if I called you back? No, no, it's OK, it's OK. I'll, uh, just check the, uh, the bookings. Um, yeah, just tell you me a little bit more about yourself. Lovely spot. Look, I-I don't think I should be doing the phones. Did she make a booking? Yep. Who did you match her up with? Actually it was me. Well, I tried to talk her into someone else, but she wanted someone her own age and she liked the sound of my voice, so... You're married. Ah, yeah, um... about that. It's, um... it's real. I... I just kept thinking she'd come back, so... so I waited. Are you still waiting? No. But you're still wearing the ring. Yeah, well, look, imagine this. You're moving furniture one moment, trying to get some money together and get on with your life, and the next moment... the entire team has been converted into sexy cleaners. You should have said. I was saving you from trying to wheel me out along with the rest of them. I mean, no one wants this scrubbing their kitchen bench. It sounds like somebody does. She'll regret it when she sees me. Aw, don't be silly. I'm sure the pair of you will have a terrific time of it. Hi. Hello. Do you only employ men as your, um... Sex professionals - that's what we call them. Right. I don't - I don't have any women. Oh, that's OK. I just thought I'd ask. I don't know. Since the kids are gone, there's a bit more time to take notice of what's going on with me. And especially after some of the bookings, I am feeling all kinds of things for all kinds of people. You sound like a young person. But if I'm gonna try being with a woman for the first time, I'd prefer it to be with someone who knows what she's doing, who can forgive me if-if I'm wrong and I want to stop halfway through. I'm being ridiculous, aren't I? No, you're not. Can you leave it with me? Thank you. Ah. Would you mind not mentioning this to Brett? Yes, as long as that's mutual. Uh... I suppose I'm here for a booking. You don't need us. I've seen what happens when you walk into a room. I... I don't like my breasts to be touched. I've got really insensitive nipples so when they get a lot of attention I feel nothing. Well, left out, really. So you want to pay for someone who will... ..ignore your breasts. Yes. Not all of my sexual experiences have been satisfying. And I'll pay for some that are, if it means good sex. People underestimate me. And they don't know that I reconfigured the entire apex programme to integrate both platforms. That day the only thing anyone said was about what I looked like, including you. I'm sorry about that. It's fine. I mean - No, it's really not. I'm used to it. It happens every day. But it's the shit sex that's wearing thin. You have a lifetime of sex ahead of you and it should be good. You're gonna have to learn to ask for what you want. It's never too late to start. I just want a decent root. Yep. I know. I was terrible, but I can do so much better. Good for you. I've been working on some moves. Please let me show you. Please. So what was that Incredible Hulk thing you did with your clothes again? Light years beyond that. Can you, for five minutes straight, move your mouth and your tongue in the exact same way? Yes. Yes, yes, I can, I can. God damn. Anthony. He ironed everything. Everything. I didn't know we offered ironing. I asked and away he went. Oh. So did he take care of anything else? Mm-hm. I should have done this years ago. Ah. Mm. Hi. Hi. Where is everybody? They stopped for sausage rolls. Couldn't bear it. Croissant? No, thank you. Home-made. Thanks. Well, if you change your mind. I need to ask you something. What's this? Hm, I don't know. Weird. Mm. So, I wanna talk to you about something. Go ahead. I've been thinking. I get a lot of thinking done about two in the morning. I think a lot more about this job than my... my old one. It's about the business model. I don't think it's sustainable. If you really think about it. Oh. Keep going, if you don't mind. It's, uh... It's a high-end... ..one-off model. You can't just... replicate the transactions. Yeah, I know. Should I go a bit faster? Yeah. Oh, no, no, that's too fast. That's too fast. Oh, OK. Cool, I'll just... OK. Fine. Yeah. Just cruise. Slower. Really cruising. Oh. Oh! One is never enough. Good As Gold Whoa. That's gorgeous. What's going on? Nothing. You got laid. Finally. It's none of your business. Sorry, your business is always my business. Did you forget your moisturiser? Mm, yeah. Use my coconut oil. Thanks. You know, that is an excellent lubricant. It goes on easy, smells amazing, tastes amazing, lasts forever and it is a healthy fat, so you can just pop it in your stir-fry. Thank you, Sandra. I don't usually... Me neither. ..use that, and... actually that was my first time. It was the first time for both of us. Was it horrible? No. Good. I can live with that, as long as it wasn't horrible. OK, I got your rose petals, your 85% chocolate, your champagne, strawberries, massage oil, condoms - so many condoms - and lubricant. Apparently silicone is the way to go. How about organic coconut oil? Oh, OK. Oh, that'll be a booking for me. In your dreams, bro. It's not loading. Yeah, the whole system is not coping. We need an upgrade. We can't afford it. If I can't make the payments, they take the company off me. Gina, the door. I'm looking for Gina Henderson. Yeah, that-that's me. Can I help you? You're in charge here? I am. Well, looks like I found exactly who I'm looking for. Not many places take on guys. I wondered if you might like to increase the team. Oh, no. No, mate, we're-we're full. Yeah, you should just piss off some place else. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, what was your name? It's Mike. Hi, Mike. I'm Gina. I know. Guys, there is no need to be rude. Just basic politeness. He was basic. He was quite rude. He threw his top off in front of us. A little bit desperate. What? He looked all - Manners. You can file that, please, under M. M for Mike. Not-not good. Hey. How's things? Great. I think I'm jealous. Of? You're astonishing sex life. Yeah, well, you should try the morning afters. I'm perfectly clear with them every time - "This is a one-off." What happens when you don't want it to be a one-off? It's too risky. Can I ask you to do something for me? Will be as much fun as last time? That's up to you. I think I could start to like this. OK. Hi! Hi. I've come to clean your house. I didn't know you clean houses. Oh. Are you gonna let me in or...? Sorry. Cute dog. Yeah. Leo. Hey, good boy. Um, it's ten in the morning. Oh. Egg cups? Lemon. And salt. It's your turn. Women. Women. Mm. Uh-uh. I've already done there. You need to find somewhere new. Mm! Shall we go again? Yeah. Just a little. Uh-huh, yeah. No, I have the number. I'm just trying to find it. Is there somewhere you want this? No, look, I-I am very sorry, OK. I will personally follow up for you, OK? I'll just count it out. My assistant's very busy. He may have missed something. Two. Uh, yeah. No, I'll hold, yeah. Three. Four. Five. Get it, girl. Yeah, no, no, I'm still here. Hey, Gina! I just thought I'd let you know that I am now the official owner of this company. Yes! Final payment complete. Hooray! Hey! Hoorah! Hayley told me so I'm showed up. Yeah, and then she got everyone drunk on the way here. It wasn't hard. Congratulations. Oh! Oh, let me please take this off. Madam. I couldn't do it - the booking. I know. I checked. You checked. You should have said if you didn't want to do. No, I did want to... until I got to the car park and I just - then I just drove straight home and ate two litres of ice cream in the dark. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm not. Whoo! Hey, Gina, get over here! And what's going on with you two? I'm risking it. I really like her. Mm! Mm! Geronimo! Are you hung over? Yes, I am. Do you know it's been years since we've had sex? Don't be so dramatic. It's been a couple of years now, I think. G, it has not been two years. Yeah, there was Bali. And when we came home from Bali. And then? Is there something you want to tell me? No. If I so much as look at you, you are so repelled you go running from the room. Running to whoever it is who is so much more attractive than me. That's not true. I'm not seeing anyone else and I never have. So you expect me to believe that you are perfectly happy just not having sex with anyone, ever? Well, no. No, I'm not - OK, I'm not perfectly happy. I just... I just seem to have lost... Lost what? Oh. I'm tired. You're always tired. Are you sick? No, I'm not sick. I got checked. What for? I'm fine. Everything is fine. We have your prescription. Gina. I just don't feel like it. You sure? Yeah. I'm sure. Er, hi there. I'm Tom from Ple-Pleased To Move You, and I'm looking forward to making sure you get everything you need - you need - you need - you need... Oh, for fuck sake. Now it's totally fried. What do you mean "fried"? I don't know. It's thoroughly shitting itself. I just don't know why it's still happening. And the booking system is down. I'll fix it. No, you don't you touch it. You will fuck it. OK, we'll just turn it off and turn it back on again. Hi. It's Gina. I need your brains. Should she be allowed in there? Alice is smarter than all of us put together. If anyone can sort this, she can. You guys need to upgrade. I don't know who set this up, but I can sort it out for you. Well, um... a little room. Yeah. Come on, guys. Just take it easy. She knows what she's doing. Sorry. Yeah, no, I'll... I'll be back here. Looking for something special? Yeah. It's or my wife. Ah. In the shit, are ya? You could say that. Good investment, then. You know you should do? Clean the house. Gets you in the good books every time. Thanks. I'm good. Well, not heaps... You are good to go. Whoo-hoo! Nice. Are we missing anything? Um... Oh, yeah. It looks like you had two movers booked for half an hour ago. Do you wanna lift? Oh, yeah. Thanks. Cool. I'll do the boxes, then, eh? It's still important. What's this? Are you gonna tell me what's in it? I really think it's for the best. Please don't do this. I really shouldn't - Please don't be like that. That is completely unnecessary. Is it because I, you know, um... Before with the... croissants? No. No, that was a career highlight. But I think it's time I did my own thing for a while. You're all set up now. It's been the greatest pleasure. Au revoir. Gina! Steve? Gina! Pleased To Move You. You've got Benjamin. Phone. I hope you clean faster than you pick up the phone, mate. I need to make a booking for today. Cool. So, can I just clarify, is it for yourself? No, well, it's for my wife. OK. But will you be there? Yeah, only if you come now. I want it to be a surprise. A surprise? For your wife and you? I mean, that's cool and everything, man. Um, I just - can I ask how you heard about us? Listen, mate, I'm just trying to work out how to please my wife. It's not that easy. So either you come now or I'm gonna do it myself. Um, I mean, I'm the only one free, but - Can we just get on with this? Yep. Oh, do you want me to get started? Yeah. I'm getting a beer. Uh... you wife... Um... are you sure? Yes, mate. Go for it. OK. Oh, are you good with music? Whatever. Sex Bomb Mm. Mm. What the fuck are you doing? I'm removing my trousers. Ben? Gina. Oh. What, do you know this guy? Pull your pants up. Oh, don't get all private now, mate. Ben, what are you doing here? I got a booking. Do you know something about this? Dude, she owns the company. Ben, this is Adrian, my husband. He doesn't know. Do you think I should go? Mm. Mm. OK, uh, excuse, um... This is the... removal thing? I employ men to pleasure women and to clean their houses. Some women just take the house clean for the sheer the pleasure of watching men do the jobs they spend a lifetime hating. Does anyone know about this? Just the clients. We're very private. Un-fucking-believable. Oh, how did you get my home address? Don't turn up at my house. Email me your resume, new photos and your penis size, and do not overestimate, please. We don't care as much as you think. She wants my penis size. Gina Henderson? Would you accompany me back to the station to answer some questions, please? Shit. The legal representative for Gina Henderson. Can you describe to me the exact nature of the business, Please To Move You? Until we know if any charges are being pressed, my client will not be answering any of your questions. Well, that may be the case, but for operating without a licence you will be fined under section 23 of the Prostitution Act. Look, this whole thing is just a big mistake. The business known as Pleased To Move You will cease operations immediately. As I said, my client will not be answering any of your questions. We do removals, clearances, domestic cleaning and, uh, sexual services. If the client wants, uh. The cleaning acts as a cover? No. No, we do the cleaning. I train them myself. We polish sinks, we clean toilets, scrub the grout on your tiles. Yeah, we clean our houses and, you know, and... give orgasms. You know, just not necessarily in that order. You admit to running a business that charges for sex. And cleaning. Don't forget the cleaning. Why do men always forget the cleaning? Hm. My client is under extreme duress right now. You were operating an enterprise where women engage in sexual misconduct under the guise of hiring domestic services. That is pure conjecture. It is not misconduct. We are fulfilling a need for all those women who feel sexually invisible, whose husbands never learned how to take a hit for the team. We're there for those who like to climax more than once, and for those who are sick of doing it alone. But mostly we are here because, contrary to appearances, we haven't given up on sex, and we're sick of cleaning the house. ALL: Yes! Did you feel forced at any time? Were you ever harmed or...? I don't think so, checking in, but, um... that'll be a no. Oh. It says here your job is to... "give orgasms." It's not actually illegal. We checked. We applied for a licence and everything. Mm. Mm. And we do cleaning. You've just admitted to operating without a licence in what is a highly regulated industry. The fine will be in the tens of thousands of dollars. I don't want you to pay it. Well, I'm gonna have to. It's not like you've got a job. We are just gonna go home, and I will sort everything out. Don't want that. Now's not the time, Gina. I'm not going back. There's no need to be hysterical. I am not. But you are. This is hysterical behaviour. Adrian, would you just fuck off? All right, I will. I will fuck off. Fuck off home without you. I'm not gonna come back to find out if you've changed your mind. And you can pay the fine by yourself - you do realise that. Absolutely. Do you know how good it is to sleep with someone who's more interested in you than in how they look naked? This has been like the best gap year ever. Yes. Do you have any questions for me? No? OK. Uh, is Gina Henderson here, please? Er, yeah. She is... She's being officially questioned. For what? Having a good time? Look, this is a unique service that women are allowed to subscribe to. It's better than cocaine. It's about the same price, though. Sandra. Sorry. Here you go, ma'am. Oh, Gina, shit. Oh, darl. Oh. So what are you gonna do? Hey, Mum, it's me - again. Uh, I spoke to Dad. He's getting used to things. I know it's been a couple of months, but I think he's still angry. Anyway, Mum... I think you're unbelievable. Tell me if you hear anything. Good luck. I hope you get it. Bye! There's still nothing. It'll be here. I hope. Don't worry about the licence. We need your statement. It's coming. Look who's here. Sorry I'm late, everyone. Aww. Oh, Tom! You did it! Aw. Aw! Huxley, meet everybody. Everybody, this is Huxley. Aw. He's gorgeous. It's dad day. Dad half day, actually. We'll move to full days when he's a bit older. I get a lot of access time so I figured we could do 'bring your kids to work day'. Cool! If he can bring his baby, can I bring my dog, please? Oh, not quite the same thing, bro. Um, well, you probably shouldn't keep them waiting any longer. Let's do it. Mate, that's my go to move. Ooh. It's here. Ooh. Can I check? Yeah! Everybody, members of the board, I hereby declare that we are a fully licensed operation! Whoo! Let's go! Par-tay! Yeah! I am guilty of looking up your address on company records. Just say the word and I will go away and I will not come back. I will leave you alone, I promise. Just... say the word. Shit. Sorry, marmalade. Burnt it. Oh, no, it's OK. I'm gonna go. It's been wonderful to see you again. Thank you for the visit. Gina, Gina, that... that wasn't a visit. A visit is when you come in and you eat a pastry, and then you think about whether you're in the mood for a glass of Pinot and then we can... ..we can work out whether you wanna have two pastries or... ..three. Te Busco Forget about the pastry. I'll just drag you to the bedroom. Mm, bedroom, that sounds very far away Ah. Ah. Mm. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks very much. Just a minute. Well, look at what you've gone and done. Baked with my own fair hand. Croissant? Yes. They're marmalade flavour. People seem to like it. Anything else? All of it. "When was the last time you let yourself ask for what you wanted in the bedroom?" Incredible. Mm. Oh. "We offer a service that encourages women to freely express what they want without judgement. We provide safe experiences so women can begin to close the pleasure gap. This is a sexual wellness company about learning how to practice your pleasure. And we'd love to help with the house while we sort your orgasm." "Because your pleasure is worth asking for." Mm. Shall we take a look? Go on. Refresh it. Yep. Oh! Oh, my word. Oh, that's crazy! Oh. Wow. "Please unblock my drains." Good As Gold Light It Up
