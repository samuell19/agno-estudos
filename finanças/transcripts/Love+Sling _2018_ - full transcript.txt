(YU HAE-JIN) (KIM MIN-JAE) (LEE SUNG-KYUNG) (NA MOON-HEE) (SUNG DONG-IL JIN KYUNG) (HWANG WOO SEUL-HYE KIM TAE-HUN) You're still too slow. It's supposed to be a surprise attack that your opponent can't even notice! Hold tight, okay? Gold medal! Hold tight, okay? - Good, you're doing well! - You can do it! Take the head and shake it! Careful with the pull! Pull him out! Good! That's right! Go in! That's it! Chi-su! Come on! Seong-woong! Attack! Pull, pull! Very good! That's it, maintain control! Good! Get in position and keep pushing! Attack! - That's out of bounds! - Heard what he said! Hey Ref! Open your eyes! Out of bounds! That's foul! Is this WWE wrestling?! Medic! Medic! Seong-woong, go in! Just a bit more! Good! Last move! Be aggressive! Seong-woong! Crawl, go! Free yourself, arms together, and crawl! Get out of it! Hey! Remember what I did? Do the bridge! The grappling move! Release the grip! Great! You can do this! Last move! Free yourself! Crawl out of it! Get out! Seong-woong! Gold medal! Gold! Dad, put it on. Ga-young, come here! Could you take 1 more picture? Come here! Please? Just one more. - Come in the middle. - Stand here. Here we go. Look. One, two, three! (LOVE+SLING) That tastes good. Next is mushroom. Son, look at this chilly powder. Isn't it beautiful? Mira's family sent this to her, but since it's just us two, and we're five, so I convinced her to split half with us, did I do well? The market only carries low quality imported stuff. Korean product is really expensive. What's wrong with the weather today? Whenever I put this out, the sun and rain swap places. It happened 5 times already! Dad, come eat! Okay, you go ahead. I'm gonna take a piss and join you fast. I got so little time today. - Dad! - Yeah? I'm not even hungry! I was trying to give you company during breakfast! Can't you just come? I hear you. I'm so thankful! Are you eating just because to be my company? - Did you wash? - Of couse! - Don't' lie! I smell pee! - I washed! Oh man… Let's eat. There's plenty of rice, get a new bowl. I won't die, it's fine. I'm back! Oh hey bro, what's up, man! - Did practice go well? - Of course. - Hungry? - Yeah. I'll fix you dinner soon. What is it? Who cares if my undies are showing? Dad, the fire isn't even ready. What? I lit it. So hot… Seong-woong, are you going out with my sister? What? Why? Your photos are in her PC… What was that for! There was something on it. You gotta eat dinner, stop eating that. Let's eat. Ice cream again? Oh geez! Not again! Don't bring that over! It fits the mood. Your boy's in college, and he'll be a national athlete in no time, right? The association people told me, the techniques my boy uses are really hard to master. That's what they said, I didn't say that. I don't know where he got that from. - You must feel good. - Why? You got a good son, and you're a free soul. I doubt that, you start to smell when you grow old alone. Then why do I smell too when I'm living with you? Go wash up for once! Wash! - So-young, come! - Wash me. - It's gonna get dark soon. - Come eat! I'm here, I'm here. Hey, Seong-woong! Stop that! Hey! You're all grown up! Why are you dressed like that? It's not like I'm naked, what's wrong? We're all family here. You are naked! Girls nowadays dress like that. Is that so? Hey. Are we family too? Well, I suppose. Then why're you dating my sister? Cholesterol should stop me from eating too much of this, but it's too good to stop eating halfway when I can eat more. - Having a moment? - What? It looked like you were talking to yourself in a trance. When was I ever like that? Seong-woong, your father must have dementia already. He talks to himself often, he's like a rapper. It happens when a person doesn't fill his daily chat quota. Hey. I always fill that quota, I talk to my son all the time. Right, Seong-woong? Can I have Raichu? He's pretending not to hear me again. So stop harassing him! I heard you skipped another blind date. I can't keep a secret in this household! If you're left alone, you'll live alone for good! Uh? Why should I live for good alone? I have a companion for life! My son, you idiot! What's wrong with it? He's ignoring you even though you called him. Jesus… Is this really that bad? That's not what I meant. - Seong-woong. - Yeah? Since we're both grown up adults, we should go to… Yeah, why? Since we're both grownup adults, we should go to… the amusement park, I have something to tell you. Sure, I got something for you too. Oh, hey. I was gonna come up. Put this in the fridge, where's Uncle G? In the shower? He looks dirty, but he showers everyday. Hi, Ga-young! - Good morning! - Yup! Seeing you Ga-young brightens my day. I heard you guys are going on a date today? To the amusement park… Don't do anything too naughty. Dad… I know you too well, you have my genes. When I was his age… Okay, I'll skip that, what's this? You didn't have to bring more food! Thank you though, take this back. Please tell Mira these were great, we enjoyed so much! Oh, the containers. Sorry, I should have filled it with something but it's empty. You kids have fun. Have a great day, I'll take these back. - Dad. - Yeah? Stop saying stuff to her, you're embarrassing. What did I say? You don't know anything. Be honest, aren't you two dating? - Of course not! - No? You got it all wrong. - You got any money? - Yeah, I got some. Then give me some. Have fun! You're so nice to everyone but not to your dad. Try living with him. It's futile. What did you want to talk about? You wanted to talk too, you go first. No, you can go first. I'll smack you, go first. Um, okay. - I just… - Remember that? Over here! Ga-young, here! Make a victory sign! So cute! You grew up well without a mom. It's been 10 years since we lived together. I wouldn't get this feeling from just living together. Right? Right. You're so dead if I get you! Don't come! Stay back! Actually… I kept something in my heart that I couldn't show to anyone. I tried really hard to keep a lid on it, but perhaps seeing him every day, my feelings grew stronger. I can't hide it anymore. Woong! Hey, bro! I'll be your mom. Come on, you already act like a mom. No, real mom. Isn't this fun? $2.66 per 100g… So 600g is… $16, right. It's $16 at the market, so same price since it's the same town. It wouldn't be different, it shouldn't be. Are you buying or not? Give me a second. Ma'am. The price went up again? The shop over there sells it for $15 per 600g. - Then buy it there. - Come on, you know me. I run the wrestling gym. Give me a better price. How much do you want? 600g. I thought you were bargaining for a few cows. How could I eat all that? - Gui-bo? - Yes? Get it, I'll treat you. - Mira's the man! - Get it. Ma'am, AA beef please! - For some reason… - What? I get teary just seeing cherry blossoms in the air. Men get female hormones as they get older. Is that so? Good for you, I get male hormones for Christ's sake. Call me when that happens, we can swap our hormones. That'll do. Holy cow! Hey, bro! Seong-woong! Beef! I bought beef! You didn't even change out of your clothes… Get up! Where have you been? Why were you so late? Ga-young came home early, you didn't even call. I slept on the couch waiting for you, my neck hurts. Stop it! - Good morning! - Morning! - Did you sleep well? - Yup! - Lovely morning milk. - Hi. Give me that, drink it. How come you… Wait, what's that? Hold still, something's there, it's not a bug though. How come you look so pretty without any make-up? You just splashed water, right? So pretty. Uncle, you're so awesome, that's fascinating! How do you drink milk in one gulp? Why's that awesome, you just drink it. - But the throat blocks it. - You have to open it. I can't do it, you're so cool. Nothing cool about it, anyone can do it. He didn't use to drink like that. Hey! Stop! I know! It's insane to love my best friend's dad! I told myself I shouldn't over and over again, but my mind and heart are independent. KANG Seong-woong! Hey! Wait for me! Seong-woong! Jesus! Fine, the wedding plan I told you yesterday… Enough! I can understand how you feel because you're definitely not normal. But getting married next year is all wrong! Why! He's not getting any younger, delaying it would be bad… So you can tell the difference between good and bad! How could you say that about love! That's not love! Five, six, seven, eight! Right! Left! Most important move! Pull, and spread, spread! Back, back, back! Hit it! Hit it! Rub! Rub! Rub! Gotta put more power into it! Let's go one more! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, right! Right! Left! Right! Left! Most important move! Pull! Pull! Spread, spread! Hit it! Hit it! Rub each other! With everything you got! Keep going! Continue! Last set! Three times! Energetically! One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! I can't do it anymore… Come on! What was so hard about that? Doesn't it feel good? Don't forget to come tomorrow and 1 person brings! 2 people! Great work today! I'm tired too… Seung-hyuk! KANG Gui-bo gym! We do wrestling! Hello, we're a wrestling gym. I see, thank you… Dude, I got a boyfriend. Me too, that bastard. He's a new trainer at a gym nearby. All housewives go to his gym, his muscles are no joke! Very nice. I'd rather go to his gym too. Go away, idiot. Go away, asshole. - Dad's not home. - I know. - Changed the code. - I know that too. What're you doing? Are you hungry? I'll cook, let's go grocery shopping! Hey, let's go shopping! You're still a student. Won't you go to college? Do you want your mom to go to college? Then I'll go. But why? About what? Why do you like my dad? You gotta have a reason. There are too many. Tell me just one, something I can understand. Uncle G's like a boy but feels like an adult. He's immature but old because he's an adult, so that explains it. He's the same man, then and now. He's always the same. People who already looked old are consistent. He shakes off wet laundry 3 times then hangs them beautifully, he even does the dishes with baking soda… That's OCD. You really think you love him? Have you ever met someone who emits light? Yeah, sure... Yeah? Then you'll know that I'm not wasting my time. Ga-young, you're sick, you really are. You need professional help, therapists can fix you. What? I'm gonna tell your dad. No! I'll tell him when I'm ready! It smells so sour. Ga-young came by the gym today. Why? Why did she? Why? Why was she there? What did she want? Huh? She wants to learn wrestling. Eh? She wants to learn wrestling. Why? To lose weight, maybe. Huh? She wants to lose weight! But she's so skinny! She got nothing to lose! How should I know?! Don't bark at me! That's so stupid! She can't wrestle! Why not? She was infamous in school for being a weirdo! She's a dork! How could you call your friend a weirdo? You always talk but never listen! I don't! Weren't we just having a talk? - Whatever! - Hey! So stupid! Front grab! Back grab! Switch! Switch! Tackle! Tackle! - You idiots! - Good morning! Warm up! Ga-young! You gotta sweat plenty! You punks! Maintain center of gravity! That's it! Make a grip! Good! Good! Very good! Come on! Get in! Get off! No need to grab so hard, get in here! Slow! Slow! I said slow down! I'll teach you. One, two! Keep going! You must get up! Push your knees! Push them! - One! - Maintain formation! - Two! - Keep breathing! Uncle G! Uncle! Keep a low stance! The other way! - Low. - Other way! Turn around, keep going! Keep going! Breathe! Very good! Breathe! What're you doing here? What? I'm helping dad. What for? What's wrong with helping dad's business? - No way! - I can tell the difference! So athletes smell different by nationality? Difference is small, but you can tell! I'm serious! But the match just won't end! Only you could've endured that, no one else could have! I was waiting for the buzzer to be rung but… - Uncle G! - What? Your hand is rough! All housekeepers get that. It's okay… Thank you, you're like the best daughter ever. Thanks, this lotion is amazing! What are you doing? What? Losing weight. What for? What's wrong with working out at a gym? Uncle G! Ga-young, wanna try this? There's a saying if you give shoes, she might run away with them. That's why I'm making a hard knot, so that you can't run away. You see? I won't run away. - Huh? - What? What is it? Make sure to wash it, someone left it here, it's dirty. Right? Fall over me. You have to flip me over, got it? And, begin! You gotta touch, then grip hard. Let's try again. Let go, let go, let's try again. You okay? Let's go again. Again! Hey! You're strong, get up. No way! Stop! Why is he screaming like crazy? How would I get out of this? What should you do? Buddy! Could you get off me? I'm getting crushed! You can't relax on top of me! You have to be on your toes, ready to counter. I had 50 or so blind dates, bald, office workers, stock brokers and everything in between. So after that TV series, everyone made the same joke. Guess what it is. What could it be? They all asked me since I'm a doctor, I never have time to date, they all joked like that. So I wanted to marry someone who never said that. You're the first one not to make that joke. Not only that joke, but I actually haven't said anything. Since you're a coach, you don't date, right? Right? Right? Right? Right? You always do it from behind. Getting down, and do it from behind. What's wrong with doing it from behind? I love it! I see. - Hello? - You like her? - Mom? - Is she good? Are you hurt badly? How did that happen? Are you alright? What? Which hospital? Gui-bo, over here, it's that way out! Heading to the hospital? Which one? My hospital! What? Okay, I'll be right there. I hope that wasn't a rejection. Who cares if she's a doctor? She's insane! Like a patient! You should still get boners at the sight of women! I can't stop worrying about you! She wasn't my type, you know that. Style? Stop kidding. Fine, let's talk about this, what was wrong with her? Huh? Her hair was short. I hate women with short hair, looking like dudes. She can just grow it. And she wore glasses. I really hate that, glasses mean anal personality. She can wear contact lenses! I was gonna let that go, but she wore long pants on a blind date! It's basic manner to wear skirts as short as barely to cover butts on blind dates! Her legs were so covered, couldn't see any skin. What a load of dog shit! That hurts! You might be too old to know this, but this is an assault, I'm gonna report you. I wouldn't hit you if you kept your mouth shut! Stop your grandma! Is this 911? Arrest CHOI Soon-ja. - She's pretty for a granny. - Do whatever you want! Living a life is a series of give and take! That's how life works! You can't always have it your way! - Grandma. - Yeah? I love that saying. Right? He said he'll never remarry. I won't go home until you meet someone! Why?! So uncle had a blind date? Yup. What happened? Are they going out? They sure are. I know it didn't work out, mom told me. What type of a girl is he into? Innocent? Sexy? Cute? - Old style. - What? Short hair with glasses, and he's conservative, so he hates seeing skin. - Uncle G. - Can't toss these, yeah? Here. Wow, what's this, thank you so much. Aren't you hot? You got a haircut? I wanted to see what it'd look like. I see. I liked your longer hair though. You look like that Tinda lady from Snowpiercer. It was a wig? That looks better. Did Ga-young make this? Yeah. She cooks well for a girl so young. Yeah? I don't like it. You should be thankful! He only likes meat. I didn't realize it before, but she's quite something. What is? I only saw her as a kid because I've seen her since baby, but she grew up well. - A wife material. - I know. What about you? What about me? What do you think? Isn't she great? That bastard… Is the flight over, Seung-hyuk? Yeah. With tears in her eyes, she held my hand, and told me to take care of our boy. Those were her last words. You're crying again. This is why you should never get married. I just got divorced. In any case, your eyes went bad out of the blue because of the stress and got glasses, right? I started wearing them since I was 7 years old. You talk back so badly. Come on… Anyway, don't get remarried. Guess what my dream was. Owner of a chicken shop? No, I wanted to be on a live stage with a guitar… You can't even play the guitar. I could learn, did you even have a dream like this? - I sure did! - What? Olympic gold medalist's loving father. So sad. Kids are useless. They think they came here and grew up by themselves. So don't bet your life on Seong-woong! He's my son, I should bet on him! Should I bet my life on your kids? He'll leave soon though. Why? He'll be in a dorm next year, then military service, after that, athlete's village, then get married. He'll leave you after this year. It only gets worse. Then… should I wrestle again? Are you nuts? - Why? - You're no miracle! He's almost all grown up, and you want to wrestle? Why can't I? I was a national wrestler. Dude. Beer belly. What about it? I can lose it quickly. - Gui-bo. - Yeah? When you were young, yes, but that's permanent now. The thing about life is, when you grow old, you must be selfish to yourself even a little. Just look at me, am I having a good life? When I die like this, what's left? All the empty beer bottles you drank will only be left. Hundreds and thousands. Many, many pros to marriage. Why are you wearing sleeveless already? Stop getting drunk, date that doctor for real. Seems like Seong-woong's all grown up, but still sensitive with stuff like that. I can't remarry because of him! I gotta piss. You should get married! I just got divorced, Mira. Then get remarried! Don't eat the leftover, Jesus! I'm here. - Hey, Seong-woong! - Evening. He knows he's a cheap drunk, why does he keep drinking? - Dad, let's go. - Yeah… He's just lonely, don't you get it? I got my son, why am I lonely? - Stop it… - Everyone should have a son. Son-in-law is like a son too. But that's too far in the future! Sir. What kind of a man would you like as son-in-law? We're not very greedy, someone who loves my kid, and cares for her? What? Being rich is good. - A homeowner. - Tall too. Handsome's a plus. From a good school, but we're not really greedy. Speaking of which, I need to talk to you… Here's chicken, go before it gets cold. Eh? Ga-young's the only one who cares about him. When did you clean up? - I'm off. - Okay. - Dad, let's go. - Where? - Come on! - I don't want to! - Dad. - Yeah? - Is your dream… - Yeah? Still me being an Olympic gold medalist? So you'll get national pension for life. Look how I live, you can't live like me. It's all for your own good! If it's really for my own good, have a different dream. Like what? You wanted to travel the world, you should at least go abroad. I'll do that when you go to the Olympics. Or meet a woman your age and get remarried. Why are you telling me to marry a woman my age? I'm gonna live with you forever. Fine. When you were conceived, I took my clothes off, then my tongue was… So nasty! - I was like… - Stop that! Look at me. Then mom was like… Stop that, dad! But I… never regretted marrying mom. Never, ever. - Dad? - Yeah? Get off if you're awake. I'm not awake. (19TH BIRTHDAY) This is mom's message to me. Seong-woong, it's mom. Happy 19th birthday. I'm so proud of you. I'm sorry that I couldn't be with you during this crucial period. Come on. I'll watch you from heaven. I only think of you, you know that, right? Same thing with dad. So take good care of him instead of me, and look after him. I'm sorry. And I love you. 19-year-old dad went to national tryout, and saw her for the first time. But unbelievably, he ran out in the middle of his match to find her. He confessed his love for her, but she had a boyfriend at that time. He got beaten up badly. But he continued to confess his love again and again. She was 10 years older, but she found him cute. My dad will never forget her. He risked everything to love her. So… there's no space in his heart for you. You must miss her a lot. Emptiness she left behind must be unbearable for you two. If it's kept empty, his loneliness will only grow. If someone has to fill that emptiness, I want to fill that emptiness as soon as possible. I'm sorry? I didn't have the courage to say that, but I think I can do it now. Thanks. Thanks, Woong. Ga-young! What brings you here so late? Let's go home together. Let's go! Don't you love that? “Without the courage to risk it all, one can't achieve anything.” By KANG Gui-bo. Kiss time. I know this is a lot to process. And very uncomfortable too. So I was being more careful. But as time passed, I liked you even more. I wanted to thank you for allowing me to feel this for the first time. I don't know what I'm saying, I imagined and practiced this moment for a long time… Ga-young. You're all grown up. How will you look at Seong-woong now? He'll understand eventually, he's a friend. If you do this again, I'll scold you bad. Don't be awkward tomorrow, that'll look suspicious. Okay? Let's go, it's late! - Morning! - Oh, hey. - Milk. - Okay, sure. Son. I'm not in a condition to run today, why don't you two run? - Uncle G! - Yeah? That switch technique you taught me before… Yes… why? - That was hard. - It sure is… What about it? We can talk about it at the gym, get going. I got it up to where I grab… I'm so sorry… - You okay? - I'm fine… - You sure? - Yeah… Alright, go run with him, I'll teach it to you later. So cool… What's the sexiest veggie? Mushroom. (Take off clothes) Mushroom! Mushroom is so hot, it's shaped like… Going home? - See you tomorrow. - Bye! Could you… take a break from learning wrestling? How come? The reason is, I'm sure you noticed, we don't have many female members. Hold on. Yes, Dona, how are you? Of course I'm well. Did you miss me? You sounded so happy to hear from me. If you came after my call, you're little bit interested. - None. - None? Not even tiny bit. You're so sure of yourself. Then why did you come? If it's okay with you, I wanted to ask you for a favor. Can I use you for a bit? For what? I'm intrigued. There's… a girl who's following me around. That girl looking in? No, she wouldn't be… Yeah, it's her. Now I realize I underestimated you quite a bit. You got the balls to reject a cute and young girl like her. I'm so turned on. What's wrong with her? Is she crazier than me? Even more? That's impossible. She's my son's friend. Wow, that's critical. This is good, I love it, I'll do it. I'll do it! I knew you would, but this is serious to me. - Do we hit the bed? - What? Are we having sex? I have to know your plan to get ready. You're one of a kind. Why are you laughing? To look like we're having a great time? Right? You really are a weirdo. - What? -Stop touching me. So beautiful! Pretty… He'd look so good in that. When I close my eyes, I see him walking, turning back to listen to me, his beautiful gums when he smile, he won't leave me… Pass. Pass. Pass. Over! More! More! More! Harder! Go! Bike harder! Keep going! Harder! More! Faster! Gonna stop? Give up? Okay. Let's breathe. Breathe in! Breathe out! Breathe in, breathe out! Breathe in, breathe out! You're embarrassing me, that's enough! It's not easy raising a child. You only did it for 20 years. 40 years for me. I think I'm all dead inside. You never listen to me. Always doing the opposite. I told you not to get married. Why bring that up again? You always had it your way, I even told you not to do wrestling. Mom… I knew this would happen to you. Are you gonna make me see you die all alone? You'll regret it once I'm in the ground, you punk. Do you not want to talk to me? We've never talked. I always nagged on my own. I shouldn't have brought it up, you always talk about you. Don't you ever listen to others? Seong-woong. Are you packing? - Drink some honey tea. - It's okay. Almost done? I wish you'd talk freely to me. About what? Anything that's on your mind. You don't feel like you anymore. Come here. Son, come sit, let's talk. Speak your mind. - Dad. - Yeah? I… Go on. - Never mind. - Speak to me. Can I not do this? You always do this before the off-season training. Alright, don't go, what's the point? Fine, don't go. I saved up so hard and was parasitic on Seong-su for this! I'm only looking out for you! To be selected as a national athlete, you know how important this training is, don't you? Do you not want to talk to me? Stay out of trouble while I'm away. Watch the food you buy. Be careful getting home when you're drunk. And watch out for women. What? Yup. Right. - See you tomorrow! - Bye, Mr. KANG! Yes, right, take care! - Mr. KANG. - Yes? Why do you look so down? I'm never down. I'll renew my membership tomorrow. - Thank you! - Feel better! - Bye! - See you! - Thank you. - Bye! Surfing's good! They'll bring out another tropical fruit. Here it comes. (UNIQUE WORLD TRAVELS) (TO SON: PAIN IS MOMENTARY.) (QUITTING LAST FOREVER. BY LANCE ARMSTRONG) Dammit, it hurts… Seong-su! Mira! Seong-su! One, two, three, four! Gui-bo! Why is he vacuuming at this hour when even Seong-woong is not around? Jesus! One, two, three, four! Uncle! Uncle! Dad! Dad! - So this is how he dies. - Uncle G! - Don't ever tell my son. - Okay, I won't tell. He has to concentrate. Hold on a little longer! - Why are you hopping in? - Where are you going? - Where's his guardian? - Dad, hop in! Why am I his guardian? Honey! Yo, wrestler, I told you to always watch what you eat. You're up? I missed your nagging. This happened because… Let me talk first. Put leftovers in the fridge, not by the window. Why did you do that? You put rice there because it tastes bad in the fridge. Remember? So I end up this way by following you. Baby, but it's summer, of course it'll go bad. I think you did it in the summer. Did I get sick then too? Whatever. - My gosh. - What is it? - Is that belly fat? - Of course. You're an old man now! Everyone my age's like this. Baby! You used to have so many dreams and confidence. Where's my hubby? Seong-woong's dream is my dream, you know. - Honey. - Yes? Seong-woong grew up well, you did good. Find your life now, okay? My life… Go easy… Gosh! That young wife must really love him. Looks like it. It's not like that. Widows would be jealous to death. We were like that at her age, weren't we? Tangerine's so sour! Hello. Ow, that hurts! You're fine. - Wait, you work here? - Nope. I just put on this gown, do I look good? - Really? - Yeah. - It really hurts. - I'm his lover. This is turning into a soap opera. This should be fun. - Dona! - What? - Like that? - Stop that, it hurts. You're messing up my IV. It's fine, you're being a baby. Ga-young, put that there, off you go, thanks for everything. So you're Ga-young. Ga-young. You could leave that and go home. No, I'll take care of him, you can go. Madame. She must really like you. I think she's jealous. Yes, I like him, madame. At my age, I get attacked with ageism quite a bit, but I'm totally fine. Because this is everything you got against me, but I got so much more to offer. That's why he likes me so much. What's there to offer? But my one strength is huge, don't you see that? I do, but not enough to make me nervous. - Why're you so almighty? - Will you all stop it? I got plenty of reasons, I could e-mail you a list. Are you two dating? Answer me, Uncle G. What's there to say, let's stop this. 'Dating' isn't adequate. I am filling his empty space. That's more like it, right, Gui-bo? That's enough. - Really? - Yeah. Uncle, say it. What's there to say, please stop. - Tell her! - Stop it, Dona. I know about his empty space more than anyone! You don't know anything! Ga-young, stop it, don't you get it?! Perfect timing! Come on… Very good. Good job. Run over! Run! Leave a rope here. Line up here. - Warm up with a partner. - Yes, ma'am. Hey, your dad's doing well, so don't worry. Is he alone now? No, Ga-young visits him often since she's got free time. Is the training going well? Don't worry about here. Higher! Higher! Run! Stop babying your son, athlete boy, cook this for yourself too. I'm fine, it's not a fatal disease or whatever. You don't recover quickly when you're sick at your age. Bones don't heal right. I've had my stupid diabetes for 20 years now, I can live with it, but others would be taking insulin forever. Please go. When you get to my age, you'll regret it all. After your father died, I worked so hard to raise you… How many times must I hear that? I'm really in pain! Get going, it's raining! You never called me once! You wouldn't notice if I drop dead. Even after dedicating my entire life to you, it's pointless! Did I ever tell you to live like that, dedicating to me? So stop only looking after the boy and look after yourself! Lifelong devotion is as worthless as a lose sock! I'm gonna stop nagging, so live your own life! Just don't get sick! Take the umbrella. You keep it, it's too heavy! How is this heavy? The clouds are black! Don't get sick and call me about it! Man… Mom! Which city do you think of when I say 'Australia'? - It's Sydney. - Sydney… Seong-su! - Seong-su! - Uncle G! Where are you? What's wrong? I tripped and fell. - You okay? - Yes. Did you do something or is it a blackout? It just went out, and I couldn't see. - Where's the fuse box? - What? The fuse box. This is called the fuse box. Why? Because it contains fuses. Where's everyone? Mom and dad went to Ji-young's field trip, and my sis went dancing again. Shine the light here. This is good. So this went out. You got any extra fuses? Toilet papers? Never mind. It has a back up battery. - It works! - Yay! It's all good now. Oh man… What a day. I hope you're not suspicious of me. - About what? - The fuse box. Come on now. Did you plan this? - Nope. - I thought so. It'd be easy to think that I was behind it. Where did you get all these? My sis was always into concerts. - Is this for cheering? - Yes, she has a ton. That's amazing. I've been here countless times, but I never noticed that. That's not your dad's style. - It's mine. - Yeah? I listened to this endlessly in the old days. You played it for me once. I always listened to this before a game, because it calmed me down, and allowed me to focus. Should we play it? Right, there's a blackout, where's my mind at? Oh man… - Wanna listen to radio? - Sure, why not. That's the song! I hope you're not suspicious of me. Why should I? That's incredible timing! This brings back memories. Ga-young. I want you to find something that makes you happy. I really do. Like a dream that's just for you. When I was lost, you were the one who held my hand. When I needed someone, it was you who were by my side. Dream is chasing happiness. That's why you became my dream. I'm doing this to for my happiness. (KANG GUI-BO – KOREA STRICHIKOF – KAZAKHSTAN ) KANG Gui-bo! KANG Gui-bo! KANG Gui-bo! KANG Gui-bo! Why wear a hat while working out? To look younger. Do I look younger? So you stole your son's hat while he's away? I wanted to try it on. When's he coming back? Let's see, when did he leave? You don't know when he's coming back? Tomorrow, right, he's back tomorrow. What a strange day, this is something. What's so strange? You've matured, you really did. So stop dedicating your life to your boy. I don't do that. Dude, I always felt bad for him, seeing him wrestle because of you. He didn't do it for me, he wrestles because he likes it. - You think so? - Of course! Seong-woong, what was that? Think you're a hotshot because you get complimented? You should do this right for your father's sake! - Why should I? - What? Come back here! Dude, your dad not coming today? What? Is he coming? Seong… hey… Free yourself! The grip! Crawl, crawl… Seong-woong, get out of it! Crawl! Go! Get out! - Gui-bo. - Yeah? He'll wrestle SON Chi-su in the finals, he needs to watch out. If he fails the selection… Your boy is born to be a national athlete. Seong-woong. This is just a warm-up to national tryout. It's fine. He's right. Good work. What's this? You don't care about anything other than gold. Have you gone mad?! Do whatever you want! Don't smoke. You don't even smoke. Seung-hyuk. You okay? Shit… What's with you? Why're you crying? It hurts so much, so damn much! Am I not allowed? I'm crying because it hurts, let me be! I… I don't know how to live. With Seong-woong too. I feel so lost… He's all grown up, you raised him well. - Gui-bo! - What? - Gui-bo! - Yeah?! Why aren't you coming in? I'm drunk, I'm gonna go home. Come inside and shut that bastard's mouth, he's talking to himself. I'm gonna go! Okay, since it's raining, take Ga-young with you home. Hey, stop! - Ga-young! - Stop that! Go home with Gui-bo! Don't do that! I'm leaving! Okay, bye! - Uncle. - Yeah? When I'm 10, you're 30, right? Yup. When I'm 20, you will be 40, right. - When I'm 30, you will be 50. -Yup. - When I'm 40, you will be 60. -So? - 3 times at the start. - Yup. - Then twice. - Yup. - Then 1.6 times, and 1.5 times. - You're right. - The difference shrinks. - So right. - Isn't it cool? - It is indeed. You're so smart, what'll you grow up to be? I'll marry you when I grow up. Yeah? Sir. I'll stop now. I'm sorry. What are you sorry for? That's part of growing up. For you and me too. You grew up a bit more. You idiot. You'll catch cold, you're all wet. Put this on. We'll now begin 98th National Men's Greco-Roman Wrestling, 63kg class, round of 32. Red's KANG Seong-woong takes the win in 1 second! Round of 16, KANG takes 2 points with a gator roll. Quarter-final is starting! KANG runs in, grabs, and suplexes his opponent! That is amazing! KANG Seong-woong! Rise of a wrestling prodigy in Korea! KANG! KANG! KANG! He runs in and flips him! Amazing move! Breaks into a run, KANG Seong-woong! KANG takes the win! Can anyone stop him? It'd be so good to have Seong-woong for this feast, right? I know, but with finals tomorrow, he's taking it easy. He has to maintain his top condition too. So if he wins gold medal tomorrow, he becomes a national athlete? Right, that's why it's an important game tomorrow. He's here! What? Evening! Come here. Speak of the devil, you little punk. Didn't eat, right? Seong-woong, I saw your game on TV yesterday, you really were something. He's good. Totally, his thighs were… Mira, come on! Get him some chicken! This is boiled young hen, very expensive stuff. Dad likes this too, young things… He likes anything young whether it's a girl or a chicken. Your relationship must be going really well. Huh? You got a girl? He went on a blind date recently, she must be quite young. You're the man! It's nothing like that. Of course it is! You got so drunk and spilled it all about a woman to Seung-hyuk! You didn't say anything to me, honestly, I'm a bit disappointed. Stop it! He'll talk when he's ready, shut up and eat! - I forgot salt! - You knew it too? Why am I the only one out? Tell us about it, everyone's curious. - Are you drunk? - Yeah. - Why? - Why? Your final match is tomorrow, are you nuts? How much did you drink? This is a new side of him. He'll win anyway, I guess it doesn't matter. Be quiet. Let's go, let's go home. Let go. Come on, get up. Why! I got things to say. About what? Let go. - Ma'am. - What? I love you. - He's so drunk! - My gosh! You're really drunk. You shouldn't do this in front of adults. - Why can't I love her? - What? You should act like an adult. Date people your age! Stop it! What's with you? Why are you doing this to my dad? Why are you selfish?! Sir, ma'am, did you know? She wants to marry my dad. What? She could be my mom. Little Ji-young sitting there could be my aunt, thanks to dad! - You're drunk. - Let go! Don't! Stop! - Dad, here too. - Stop it. - Don't! - Dad! Dad! - Stop! - More dad! Stop what?! There are only pictures of dad! It's just a crush! Gui-bo. Hey, what's going on? Can you explain? It's okay, that's enough, this isn't unusual. I wanted to marry my teacher in high school. She's at that stage. This is not unusual? What a load of crap! I fell for him, he didn't do anything! Buddy! Gui-bo! Explain yourself! Who fell for whom? You call yourself an adult?! You punk? Act your age like an adult, jerk Where's your sense of responsibility?! Let go of him! Who fell for whom? This is insane! Good day, ladies and gentlemen. We're about to start 63kg class final match for the 98th National Men's Greco-Roman Wrestling. Top ranking college wrestlers, KANG Seong-woong and SON Chi-su are facing off once again. This is going to be really competitive. KANG showed incredible prowess in the preliminaries, but he has not shown up yet. You're right, he has to enter soon. Yes. Have you contacted him? Yes. He'll be disqualified in 2 minutes. - Call him again. - Right away. - Something happened? - How long? 2 minutes. Could you buy us some time? Mr. Chairman, is it possible to delay the match a little? What's going on? My wrestler went to the toilet and he'll need 5… Coach! Ah, he's in. Get ready! Seong-woong, you… Okay, stay focused. Run over! KANG enters with 10 seconds remaining. He's professional who made a fashionably late entrance for the finals. Seong-woong, watch him trying to dig in. Go head-to-head, don't spread arms! Good! Stay alert, he'll try again! Go at him again! Stay on him, stay low! That's a foul! He'll dig low! Good! You gotta keep moving! Get out of it! Good! Very good! Seong-woong, pin him down! Seong-woong! Seong-woong! Hey! The other way! Good job. Lower stance works better. Breathe and rinse. His eye's bruised up because of the foul. Seong-woong. Go into defense, wait and pull the nelson hold. Just as we practiced. And it's not what you think. Don't think about it and focus on the game. I'll explain everything properly after the match, okay? It's not what I think? Get in here! Of course not, stay in the game! Does it feel good that I obey you? What? You wanted me to wrestle. Why did you force me? Blue, attention! Let's talk later, must we do this now? Yes. You did it because you liked it. I liked it? Did you even ask me? Did you even bother to ask what I liked? Let's go. I never once liked this even once. I forced myself to eat the meat you gave me. Huh? Am I pig? Lose and gain weight at your command, I only thought of putting a gold medal on you for this whole time of training. Not on me, on you! Was I doing this for me? I did what I did for you! Get over there! Go! It's all your fault! This is all your fault! You want to ruin this? You wanna live like me? What do I get out of this? Are you gonna be like this? Seong-woong. Back flip! Seong-woong, do you like wrestling? No, I like you more. You like me more? Yup! Come here. - Seong-woong? - Yeah? Is there anything you want to do with me? I'll do anything for you. Wrestling! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I got my appendix out, I'm fine. Eat slowly. I'm young, so it's okay. I thought I'd see you when I came here. I came here for a week. You could've called, or come downstairs. These coincidences are common on TV. Almost ready to fly out? Can't keep any secrets at home. I have nothing to get ready. I'm studying abroad because I can't go to college here. Hey, bro. You're scaring me. You two should stop worrying for each other and live your life. Your life, uncle's life, they're all important. Put these on. It's okay, this is fine. Soles are still good, I'm good. But give me that hat. Thanks. Thank you too. Why are you thankful? You know, I'm thankful that you're thankful. Let's eat pork… Or whatever's in the fridge. No, let's eat pork. It's okay, there's a backstory. Should we really eat some pork? Which part? Neck fillet or belly? It's gotta be belly. - Belly? - Yup. Okay, sure. In that case, do we have green onion? Seong-woong! Let's put this up. Yeah? This one's on top. Here we go. It's a present! Curious? One, two, three! Isn't it cute? I made it myself. Okay. Thanks. - Seong-woong. - Yeah? - Call me 'aunt'. - What? Allow me to apologize for my son. Not at all, I haven't accepted him. Please don't. Absolutely not. Could you stop that? Please come in! So hungry… Why aren't you coming in? Allow me to apologize for my son. No need. I haven't accepted him. Lower yourself, we're sinners here. Please don't say that. No, as my in-law, I mean, Mira. In any case, you've been a tremendous support during this difficult time. Don't you think, Gui-bo should die alone? Absolutely. I've been nagging him out of courtesy, because I'm an old woman, it's no shame dying alone. It's been 3 months since our families lived in shame through that incident. Let's all go back to our lives and do our absolute best! Exactly. You are wise for in-laws. I mean, Seong-su. You seem to be implying something, right? Are you doing that on purpose? I didn't bring food, eat a ton here. In any case, merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Jesus! Mira, thanks for the food. Let's eat! Yeah, let's eat up. (HANNA INN) Your dad's not here today? He's not here, bastard You getting nervous? So nice… - It's your son. Did you eat? - Why did you call? - Where are you? - Nutmeg forest. What's that? It's got nutmeg trees. Air here is astounding! - Why are you calling me when pooing? - Mom, later on… My ass is not what it used to be. Later on… When you get older, you can't even poop properly. Can you let me speak for once?! I'm the one who called you, why you do all the talk? You gotta get out more while you still can. It's hard to get out once you get old. I'm trying to tell you we should come together! I keep saying later, later later! We really are not compatible. I'm gonna hang up! She tells me I don't ever call, but what's the point? She just blabbers on. It's nice, though. (DIRECTED BY KIM DAE-WOONG) How do I look? I don't understand. You got a haircut. You look like that Tinda woman from Snowpiercer. - Gui-bo. - Yes? - No more using me? - No more. Then can I use you? How? I actually have a guy who's following me around. Is that him? No way, he couldn't be… - It's him? - Yeah, it's him. Don't look, stop that! Why do you not like him? He's insane. Even crazier than me. - How is that possible? - Batshit. He's off the chart? (LOVE) Okay, I can kinda see it now. How can I help you? I owe you, so tell me. - Give me a sec. - Stay over there. My darling. - Could you laugh? - Laugh? As if you can't live without me. I'm laughing. Laugh, keep on laughing. Put your arms around me. Come on now, that's too much. Could I help you after my trip? Is that an invitation? No, not at all. I'm gonna go alone. Going together is helping. No, I have no intention of that. Gui-bo, are you playing hard to bet? What? You're trying to make me cling onto you, you're good. - Keep going, this is good. - You're so right. Keep playing games. Play hard to get? Harder? - Wait a minute. -Gui-bo, you're so fun! Yes, hello? You're hurt? Right now? I should come too! Hold on. There, over there! Wait a minute. Which hospital? Wait for me!
