(crowd chanting) - Otto, Otto, Otto. - [Woman] I love you batman! - Otto! - Free the batman! - [Crowd] Otto! Otto! Otto! Otto! Otto! Otto! Otto! Otto! Otto! Otto! - The press is eager for a new story. - [Otto] I never knew what I was capable of until I met Dolly, the lines I was willing to cross. She could make a man believe that day was night, evil was good, and obsession was love. - Is that him? - Gentlemen. - Not much to look at. - [Man] Let's see what we got here, Fred. - [Man] Oh, okay. (whistles) - Now that... - [Man] Now, we're talking. - I'm going for Jane Winton. The green-eyed goddess of Hollywood. - I'm not much for the flicks. - Oh of course. It's a frivolous waste of time for the textile king of the Midwest. (chuckling) Dolly Korschel, Mr. Oesterreich. - Call me Fred. - Okay. - Uh, thank you. Thank you very much, Dolly, thank you. Well. Cheers to that. (upbeat music) (camera clicks) (upbeat music) - Morning dear. - Hmm. - How you feeling? - A new discovery: hormones. They say it's very promising. - I don't know if I can go through that again. If God had meant for me to have a child... - I have faith. - Can I show you something? I copied it from a French magazine. Added a little something on the hem, but I sewed it myself. It's even fancier than the ones in Paris. - That's very sweet dear, but my customers are not in Paris. (chuckling) - Well, then we could go to Paris and sell it there. Wouldn't that be fun? - Mmm. - The design comes straight from Paris. I was hoping you ladies might help me persuade Mr. Oesterreich that these would make a nice addition to the line. - We could precut the ruffle to simplify assembly. Well, hi, Otto. - I understand machine 22's misbehaving? - The thread's bunching. - Small potatoes. - Mistress to Murder? - Otto's gonna be a writer. - [Otto] Only if the magazine says so. - A writer? - Pulp stuff. Lurid examinations of the underbelly of life. - "Her lips shimmered under the moonlight "as Loretta leaned in to kiss him. "She pulled the gun from her purse, "pressing the snub nose into his belly and shot him." - Nothing for a fancy lady like you. - Make it a nickel. - Raise you a nickel. - Gonna raise you and bump. - Mmm. Big spender. I got one for you. New Years Eve, Sally stands up at a bar. She says, "I want you to stand by the person "who you cared the most about." Midnight strikes, chaos erupts, there's the bartender. He's trampled to death. - Oh, oh. (laughing) Oh, not funny, Fred. - Dolly! Come in here and bring us some of that sweet cherry pie of yours. - [Man] Oh, cherry pie. Good god, let's get a taste of that. Here it comes. - [Dolly] Enjoy, gentlemen. - Ooh. (laughing) - Mmm, my little snookums. Gentlemen, I love this woman more than life itself. - [Otto] Dolly had seduced Fred as her meal ticket. But now he was getting fatter, and she was hungry for something more. And she was gonna get it, even if she had to destroy Fred smile by smile. (humming) - [Fred] Somebody woke up on the right side of bed this morning. - Can't a sweet wife make her husband's favorite breakfast if she feels like it? - I gotta rush this morning. Buyers in from New York. Why don't you bottle this mood and save it for when I get home later. - Well, maybe if I knew you were taking me to the speakeasy on Saturday, I'd be like it all week. - I'm not bargaining for your affections. If the buyers want a fancy show, I'll take you out. If not, have dinner on the table at six. - [Otto] Hard to be sure when Dolly first got murder on her mind. But she knew if somebody was gonna die from boredom in Milwaukee, it wouldn't be her. (mellow music) [Otto] Dolly wanted too much from life to stay trapped in a loveless marriage. And you can't keep lightning in a bottle forever. - The Sheik with Rudolph Valentino is playing at the Bijou. (kissing) Might be fun. We never do anything anymore. - I don't mind if you go without me. - Annie says they're opening up a speakeasy on Wellington. I hear they have Tanqueray gin all the way from London, England. - The real McCoy? - No more of your bathtub gin. - I don't think we should break the law in public. You've been all over the place. Look where I've been, Cicero. - That was Chicago. - I said no. By the way, we're making small run on your aprons. Congratulations. - How wonderful. My Singer's broken. The thread is bunching. I was just about to start making a little sailor suit for Fred Jr. - You're not... - No. But I wanna be prepared. Could you send a repairman out to fix it? (mellow music) - [Neighbor] Morning. - [Otto] People say timing is everything in life. But Dolly made her own timing. She knew that walking up those steps that fateful day would change my life. (mellow music) - Mrs., Mrs. Oesterreich. - Goodness gracious, I forgot you were coming. (mellow music) - [Otto] All Dolly had to do was walk in the room and I was ready to roll on my back and put my four paws in the air. - "She eyed him from head to toe. "His face beamed with naive complacency." Been reading a lot of pulp fiction myself. - Your machine is good as new. - You're good with your hands. You should take off my shoes and rub my feet. - [Otto] When she sets those eyes on you, I swear it could make Michelangelo kick out a stained glass window. - Don't be nervous. Have you ever been with a woman before? It's not a trick question. - No, ma'am, I, I haven't. - Good. Then you'll have no bad habits, unlike my husband who can be a brute. (gentle music) This will be more fun if you take your clothes off. - Are you gonna take off your clothes? - Next time. Would you like a next time, Otto? - Yes, I would. Absolutely. - Good. If Fred asks, tell him you need another part from the factory to finish the job. Got it? - Yes ma'am. - I just might have to break that Singer everyday. - [Otto] Couldn't eat. Couldn't sleep. I showered twice. If I was going down this dark dirty road, I was going down clean. (mellow music) - Otto. (mellow music) Not so fast. You want me? - Does a thirsty man need water? - No touching until I say so. First these. Then you can drink until I've had my fill. - [Otto] Dolly worked you over slowly inch by inch, until before you knew it, you had no name and nothing left to say but yes ma'am. - Good boy. (upbeat music) (moaning) (upbeat music) (moaning) - That's exactly what I needed. See? Good habits already. - [Otto] You know I'm crazy about you. - That's what I was counting on. Fred is so mean to me. And you are a sweet young man. I just might want you every day. - Forgive me, ma'am, I'm not so sure how I feel about seeing a married woman. I know it's too soon, but do you think you could consider getting divorced? - And live how? I refuse to be poor like my mother. She was a cleaning lady. That'll never be me. So, until you can afford to give me the life I want, or if something were to happen to Fred, God forbid, I'll stay Mrs. Oesterreich. You just focus on making me happy. Isn't that what we want? - [Otto] More than anything in the world. - Good. So you don't have any doubts, take that little cutie-patootie seamstress that had her eye on you out. I'm not done with you, yet. (dramatic music) - Should I go out the back? Your neighbor lady gave me the eye second time she seen me. - Mrs. Clarkson is nosy enough to tell Fred. No, um, let her see you go out the front. I'll figure out a way for us to see each other. ♪ My schemes are ♪ Like my dreams - [Dolly] Oh, Fred, please tell me you're not smashed again. ♪ Holding in the sky ♪ Some people make a way - God, you're a stinking drunk. Now Fred, sober up first. ♪ The game ♪ 'Cause I'm always chasing Randy's ♪ ♪ That may come to you - Oh! Ow. - Oh! (grunts) (quartet singing) - [Otto] Dolly made sure that I saw her everyday, and I was addicted. I needed to see why this girl was the cure. - You know, Otto, some girls think kissing on the first date is a slippery slope to hell. - Headlong ride into disaster. - I want you to know, I'm not one of those girls. ♪ Each one is enjoying ♪ The good old summertime - So you can kiss me. Well, that is, if you wanna kiss me. ♪ In the good old summertime That's not a slippery slope, Otto, that's jumping off a cliff. ♪ And that's a very good time ♪ That she's your tootsie - [Otto] Turns out when Dolly is the drug, there is no cure. (people laughing and chatting) - Hard on the back, good for the soul. Freddy, when are you and that beautiful wife gonna produce one of these? - Anytime now. Tell you, it won't be for lack of trying. (laughing) - It sure won't. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Hey. - Hi, Mr. McCarty. - How are you, dear? - This is too easy for you, isn't it? Go further. Nice catch, Jake. Such a lovely party, Susan. Very neighborly of you to invite us. Jake is getting so big. - Mm-hmm. You are so good with kids. Are you gonna try again? - [Dolly] I just don't know if it's meant to be. - [Susan] But you must get so lonely in that big house all day. - I understand you see my brother around here. - I didn't know you had a brother. We didn't meet him at the wedding. - Lost soul. Breaks my heart, really. Fred doesn't like it when he comes around. So, I feed him from time to time. I just think that's the Christian thing to do, don't you? - Family is family. - So, my secret's safe with you? - [Otto] I couldn't stay away. I was on a high and I didn't want it to end. Consequences be damned. May I kiss you? - Do you mean to kiss me? - [Otto] As if my life depends on it. - [Dolly] You are the sweetest man, and I enjoy being with you. - [Otto] I want that more than anything. Hell, Dolly could lock you in a cell, and convince you it was paradise. She was that good. - I can't wait for you to see this. You're gonna love it. Isn't it perfect? Use your imagination, Otto. We can turn this entire place into our perfect love nest. - [Otto] I don't understand. - Well, what do writers do? They don't repair sewing machines. I'm offering you the chance to quit your job and never have to worry about money again. - I don't understand. - Stay here. (giggles) Become the writer you've always dreamed of and the devoted lover I know you can be. In your whole life, you'll never get a sweeter offer. - Quiet room and a hot tomato? I must be dreaming. What about Mr. Oesterreich? - You'll stay up here during the evenings. Be quiet as a mouse. During the day, this entire place will become our playground. Do you have family, Otto? - I'm an orphan, I have no one. Not even certain of my age. - Well, that's perfect. I don't mean to be insensitive. What happened to your mother? - She died in a factory accident. - And your father? - Never met him. (gentle music) - Well, mine left when I was four, so to hell with parents. - Could I come and go as I please? Even in the daytime? - No. No one could know you're here. We don't wanna arouse suspicion. We can't let my busybody neighbors see you anymore. Besides, why would you wanna go? You'll have me every day. Just remember my rules, no noise at night. Stay away from the windows. As far as the world's concerned, you don't exist. - Bird in a gilded cage. - I thought you'd be grateful. I'm the one making the sacrifice. But you have a choice. Stay here, write, have a blissful life. Or get out and never see me again. (gentle music) (panting heavily) - [Fred] Yeah, that's right. Tell me you love it. - Ah! Ah! (Fred grunting) - [Otto] I heard everything that night, just like she wanted me to. Drove me crazy. She wanted that, too. (gentle music) - [Dolly] Otto, my dear sweetheart, oh, I've missed you so much. - I heard you scream. I wanted to bust down there and rescue you. - Your damsel in distress. You're my guardian angel. - I was so upset, I couldn't close my eyes for hours. - I'm sorry darling. Let me make it up to you. Take off my blouse. Now my skirt. - [Otto] Maybe I should have suspected something and beat it the hell out of there. But when Dolly kissed me suddenly, I found myself in another country without my shorts on and the biggest grin my face could handle. I still have no idea whether she loved me or was playing me for a sap. But she made me so dizzy, I didn't much care either way. I've been hungry all my life, so scraps from Dolly's table tasted better than anything I'd had before or since. I don't know if you call it love, but I needed her like other folks need to breathe. - It is a great comfort knowing my love is willing to fight for me. Are you writing today? - You're my muse. - Write something special for me. That way, someday when we're living in Hollywood, and you're a famous author, and we're living a glamorous life, the whole world will know I inspired you. I'm going to the market. Can I get you anything? I don't, I don't even know what you like. - Whatever you decide. - Good answer. You can use the house. Stay away from the windows. Mrs. Clarkson is such a busybody. - I needed a story that said stick with me, I'm going places. If I couldn't cut it as a writer, she'd toss that page with my name on it at the bottom of the wastebasket, and I'd be back to fixing bobbins. So, not much riding on a story except the rest of my life. I began to dream of the security that comes from a steady roof over my head and a few things to call mine. (gentle music) (typewriter keys clacking) For Dolly, maybe I was just another possession like a new coat that she'd wear around a few times and give to the poor. But for me, all she had to do was bat her eyelashes, and it was like a theater curtain opening on the greatest love story ever written. I knew I had to deliver if I wanted to play on that stage with her. (gentle music) (typewriter keys clacking) "Edward and Louise were strangers "to this sordid night life of the city. "Fate brought them together in the Rusty Scuttle "where they both took jobs rather than starve. "There in the midst of "frenzied nightclub gaiety and human corruption, "they found in each other the love they were made for. "Honest, "strong, "and beautiful. "Yet in time, they too would be infected with the "passion of easy money." - Oh no, don't stop. - It's all I have so far. Do you like it? I know I'm no Georgette Heyer or Dennis Mikayo. - You finish that story with Edward and Louise, and I'll get it published. (mellow music) This smells delicious. Where'd you learn to cook like this? - Been on my own. It's cook or starve. - Yeah? Well then. (door closes) It's six. Get upstairs, it's time to be the dutiful wife. - Will you serve it to him? - No, no, no. Get upstairs in my room. Come on. - [Fred] Dolly? - [Dolly] Dinner's all ready. How was your day? - Nothing you need to worry about. I gave those buyers a taste of Milwaukee horsetrading. (chuckles) - Sure you did. - Dinner smells great. When we first met, you were the worst cook I ever met. You finally learned. Let's eat, I'm starving. - [Dolly] Just trying to be the best wife I can be. - And ever grateful for your bounty. Amen. This looks delectable. - I'm always looking for new recipes to make you happy. - Keep cooking like that, won't have to go out to eat. (laughing) - I can't remember the last time you took me out to dinner. Or anywhere else, for that matter. - I work hard all day for the both of us. I come home tired. The last thing I wanna do is go out again. - That's funny, it's the first thing I wanna do. (gentle music) - [Fred] I'll take you out. Show you out. - Really Fred? - If that'll satisfy you. - It would. Thank you. - [Fred] Can I have some of that cherry pie I love? - It's all gone. - Half a pie on the kitchen counter that I left this morning? Unless you're eating for two, don't go getting fat on me. - Take a look in the mirror, Fred Oesterreich. Pretty soon we'll have to have your suits made by Omar the tent maker. (Dolly grunts) - Don't smart mouth me. - [Otto] Somehow, years flew by, and that attic became my real home. The only home I've ever known. Dolly kept us playing our parts like some strange family. - This is trash. Why are you reading this trash? - [Otto] Like all families, we had our share of secrets and lies. Dolly was insatiable, and it took both Fred and me to keep her happy. He paid the bills, and I kept a smile on her face, which kept the whole arrangement from blowing up in our faces. (upbeat swing music) Fred and me were some kind of partners. I was a silent one. Sure, there were close calls, but we dodged them. To tell you the truth, I got so comfortable being Dolly's stashed away lover... (books banging on floor) okay, her sex slave, I forgot what life was like in the real world. (upbeat swing music) But that world was going crazy, and we couldn't hide from it forever. Fred's business took a beating. Dolly figured if our golden goose wasn't gonna lay more golden eggs, she'd find a new goose. Dolly brought the outside world to me: newspapers, books, latest magazines, and I was like a bat in a cave, more comfortable in darkness than light. - [Dolly] It is a lovely day. - Yeah, I wouldn't know. Winter or summer, it's all the same in here. - Not today. Today, we're celebrating. Your 21st birthday. - You don't know my birthday. - Then why not today? You've been my sweet, loving Otto for the last four years. Happy anniversary. - Our anniversary. - Mm-hmm. So, you wanna help me blow them out? There's something else. (clears throat) Love Nest Story seems to think you're a damn fine writer. - They're publishing my story? - Who inspires you? - You do, my gorgeous muse. (gentle music) - The first of many, I'm sure. I'm so proud of you. I planned a special celebration. - So you're excited to see number 47 today? - Oh, no no. (laughing) No, we're going out. I told Fred my mom was sick, and that I was gonna have to go see her all day, maybe even all evening. - She really sick? - I don't know. (giggling) - [Otto] It was our first night out together, and I didn't care who saw us. I was damn published writer now. - [Man] Coco-Cola or Pepsi? - But in my head... - Tanqueray. - [Otto] Maybe I never left the attic. (upbeat music) (people laughing and chatting) [bar patrons] Cheers! - [Bartender] Here's your drink. (upbeat music) - [Otto] Dolly gave me everything, but I couldn't help wondering what she'd stolen from me in that love nest. I heard the stories about prisoners being released from jail, or soldiers coming home from war. A normal life was too much for them now. I was terrified that this was happening to me. (ominous music) - [Woman] Ooh, is that guy okay? (upbeat music) - [Dolly] You're shaking, what's wrong? - I wanna leave now. Can we go home? - Of course. Of course, let's go home. (gentle music) - I have to know if there's any hope for us. - There's always hope, Otto. - What if we were free to do whatever we want every night? Like a real husband and wife? - Is that a proposal? (gentle music) Real lamb stew. It's Fred's favorite. - You know that lamb is my favorite. So, you're thinking of bringing it to your mother's. - I thought it would help bring up her strength, because she can't afford to eat the way she should. She's very grateful for your kindness. - What about my strength? That's what you should be concerned with. If I got sick, God forbid, you'd be the one starving. - You would never let your loving wife starve. I assume you have life insurance? - Of course I do. - I promise I'll make it again soon, okay? The butcher knows to call me when fresh lamb comes in. (dramatic music) - As long as I'm paying the bill, I'm your priority. I'm sorry. I hope your mother feels better. Let me make it up to you. You know where I will be taking you? The Wisconsin Club tomorrow night. - The Wisconsin Club is the premiere club in the city. All the best people will be there, so I wanna draw attention, but not too much attention. - No matter what you wear, every eye in the place will be on you. - Is that your way of saying this is too revealing? - I hate that everyone will watch you dance but me. - But you get to see something they never get to see. And you get to do things they only dream about. - [Fred] Dolly? - Go. Get under the bed. Hi darling, how was your day? Full of triumphs? - Nothing you need to worry about. Your only concern is to be beautiful tonight. I wanna see the envy in their eyes. This should help. - Oh, it's beautiful. (Fred humming) Bedazzling. I'll make you proud, I promise. - I have no doubt. We leave in 30. - Oh. Thank you, thank you, Fred. - [Fred] I going to show off my beautiful wife and her gorgeous necklace. - [Otto] Dolly was mine. I loved her. So, every time she was with Fred, it felt like she was cheating on me. Drove me crazy. Just about crazy enough to blow the whole thing wide open. Maybe that's what she wanted. (upbeat ballroom music) - [Checker] Thank you sir. Thank you ma'am. (upbeat ballroom music) - [Fred] Look at them staring. They can't take their eyes off you. - [Dolly] But I only have eyes for you. Come on Fred, let's dance. - What? No. I don't wanna dance. - Oh, come on, that's why we're here. You wanna show me off, so show me off. - Okay. - Okay. - May I have this dance? - I don't see why not. (upbeat ballroom music) - Roy Klumb, Mrs. Oesterreich. I have your family's insurance. - Oh? And are you taking good care of us, Mr. Klumb? - Please, call me Roy. Poor Fred. - What makes you say that? - I bet he can't decide whether to show you off around the town or keep you locked away for his eyes only. - Oh, and what advice would you give him? - I'd keep you all to myself. - I'm afraid that wouldn't be enough. - My turn, Klumb. - This is so much fun. - Sure, sure thing, Fred. - [Fred] We are leaving. (upbeat music) (gentle music) You humiliated me. - How do you think I feel getting dragged off the dance floor like a seven-year-old? - I'm going to do worse. - It's a dance Fred. I like dancing. I'm sorry that you hate dancing so much. - You don't have to flirt with every man in this club. - You like when they stare at me 'cause it makes you feel like a big man. - You don't have to enjoy it so much. - It's harmless fun. I come home to you at then end of the night. Isn't that enough? - [Checker] Your hat sir? - No. - Your coat, ma'am. Good evening. - Let's go to bed darling. I'll make it up to you. - What the hell? Stay here. (dramatic music) - [Otto] Maybe she wanted Fred to catch me. Maybe she wanted to see if I had the stones to stand up for the woman I loved. All I know is Dolly had her hooks into me so deep, I knew I had to do something, or spend the rest of my life hiding in the woods like some mangy dog. - Hey, hey kid. You're awful young, but you look like you sure need a belt. (chuckling) - If a beautiful woman made you her sex slave and locked you in her attic every night, would you stay or leave? - If you leave, can I take your place? (laughing) - [Otto] Maybe a smarter guy would have run. But I wasn't smart enough for that. - Don't ever do that to me again. I don't know what Fred would do if he found out. - I'm not gonna roll over on my back with my paws in the air for Fred. - Otto, we don't belong with the dull, bossy Freds of the world. We belong in the sunshine with the kind of people we dream about. (dramatic music) One day, we'll be there. I know it. (dramatic music) Will you keep this for me? I would just feel so much safer. - [Otto] Alarm bells should have rung right then. Maybe they did, but I couldn't hear them. Besides, it was either stay here in my lover's arms, or swap sips with that old buzzard in the park. That ain't much of a choice. - I'm worried about Fred. He seems to be having DTs lately. He's been forgetting things ever since the crash. Maybe he's drinking too much? Maybe something else I can't possibly know. - Has he seen a doctor? - You know Fred. Won't waste his time on doctors. But I'm scared for him. Should he become incapacitated, or die, I just wanna know his life insurance will protect us. - Your husband pays his premiums like clockwork. Trust that you're amply protected, whether he's drooling in his soup or in the ground. So don't you worry. I assure you. - That's such a relief, thank you. - [Otto] Dolly was playing chess, and me and Fred were her pawns. He had some crazy notion that he was still in charge. So, he figured a night out on the town, and all would be forgiven. Maybe he wasn't that smart either, 'cause Dolly ain't exactly the forgiving type. (gentle music) - You're flirting already. - I'm looking around the place. God. It's always something with you. Can't we just enjoy ourselves? - Keep your eyes on me. - Why don't you put horse blinders on me. - I'll think about it. Waiter! I'll have the kasseler rippchen, the smoked pork chop, and then she'll have the Muenchen weisswurst. - Make mine with sauerkraut and spaetzle. (gentle music) That was Marlene Dietrich's favorite. - Oh? (chuckling) I have news for you. You're never gonna be a famous actress. You're never gonna have sex with Rudolph Valentino. And you're never gonna move to Hollywood. So, why can't you just be here with me in Milwaukee. (people chatting) - If I thought life with you was all there was or ever would be, I'd drink myself to death. - That's too bad. It's Prohibition. You'll just have to live with it. (mellow music) So, where the... Where are you going? Stop embarrassing me! You get back here. Stop that. You know, count your blessings it's a ... depression. - Damn depression. Rah, rah, rah. - You were supposed to be a good wife. Instead you're a gold-digging tramp! - Well, I didn't strike gold, I got mud. So, the joke's on me. - You were supposed to give me a son, but you couldn't even do that. - Well, that joke's on you, because I've been wearing a diaphragm this entire time! - What? - I would never bring a child into this godforsaken... (grunting) - Get your hands off of her. - [Fred] Who the hell are you? - I'm her lover. Every day while you're at work, we're at play. - So, is this true? - I've been living in your attic for six years. I've heard every stupid word that you say, and every insignificant thing that you do. - I took care of you. I loved you. - You didn't love me. You just wanted to own me. (men grunting) (Dolly screaming) (gun fires) (dramatic music) - Are you hurt? We don't have much time. The neighbors will have heard the shot. - [Dolly] What are you doing? - Don't worry, I've been here before. - How? - In the pulp fiction in my mind a thousand times. Give me your necklace. - Okay, okay, okay. - Trust me. Come on. - [Dolly] Okay, okay. - I'm sorry to do this to you, my love. - [Dolly] What? - Just trust me. - Okay. - Count to 10, and start screaming, and don't stop until the cops arrive, okay? - Okay. (suspenseful music) Let me outta here! - [Mrs. Clarkson] I heard a shot and called you right away. (Dolly screaming) - My god, he's dead. - Follow me. Check that back door. - [Dolly] Let me outta here! Help! (panting) He took his watch and my necklace. - Calm down, ma'am. - Come on, ma'am, let's go. - The prowler might still be in the neighborhood. Can you describe him? - Uh, some, some kind of bum, maybe 40. I don't... He had, um, filthy hair, and a filthy beard, and ratty clothes. He was really twitchy, and I told Fred not to fight him, but he was my protector, and he wasn't gonna let somebody come in here and hurt me, so he fought him. - The guy steals a watch and a diamond necklace, but he doesn't touch the cash in the wallet? - That's odd. What can I say, detective, I mean, it's not like she locked herself in the closet. (dramatic music) (Knocks on window) - Dolly. Dolly, it's me. - Hi. Here. You knew exactly what to do. - Real murders are the basis of my stories. - But you saved us. - I have a feeling he's gonna keep chasing after us. - What, the cops? - They can't see us together. - No, no, I can't do this without you. - They don't even know about me. That's how they'll get us. - No, please don't go. - It's not safe. - You'll always be safe with me. Okay, soon as the insurance money comes, we're gonna go to Los Angeles, and we're gonna live the lives that we've always dreamed. - [Otto] If Dolly was scared, she'd never let that detective know it. She marched in there like she was doing them a favor. - [Dolly] No, no, it was scragglier on the sides. Mm-mm, longer than that. - A big shot like Mr. Oesterreich gets killed, and the guys upstairs want the juicy details. You understand? - [Dolly] Of course, Detective. It's all about sex, lies, and bank accounts. - That's it. - A lady just doesn't talk about such sordid things. That's not bad. It's unfortunate you can't get the stench in that drawing. He smelled like a cesspool. - You know how most murder victims die, Mrs. Oesterreich? - Gun shots, I'm assuming? - In my experience, this is usually at the hands of loved ones. - Fred and I were more in love than ever. Even after all this time. - [Detective] Did you fight? - Never. - You hear that, Elmendorf? Married couple that never fought. - I wouldn't know. - Apparently, my husband was more understanding than either of you. - Let's say the late Mr. Oesterreich was a model husband, and you the model wife. Did he have enemies outside the home? - He was a tough businessman, but honest. He was a good friend and a good boss. Everybody loved him. - Not everybody. (dramatic music) - No such thing as a burglary gone bad in this town? - Not in my 20 years on the force. - Do you still need me to be here, detective? - You going someplace? - Home. I just wanna go home. - You're free to go, Mrs. Oesterreich. (dramatic music) Something doesn't smell right. - Cops still snooping around? - They don't think our marriage was hearts and roses, but they don't think I killed him. What about the insurance company? - I put their minds at ease, and I'll keep them at ease. - Good. Thank you. So, I'm a free woman? - A free rich woman. - [Otto] Oh, she was good. Poor bastard never knew what hit him. - To Fred: who liked his gin warm and his women cold. - Never got my hot and cold mixed up like that. ♪ It keeps on repeating ♪ Your lovely name ♪ Even when we are far apart - My husband was more generous than I thought. - [Roy] You know you're in great danger. - How do you figure? - You're rich, beautiful, sexy as hell. The wolves will be crawling out of their holes to eat you up. - And are you the first wolf? - No. No, I'm your insurance policy. Let me show you the town so the wolves here are protected. - [Dolly] Patience, Roy. I'm a grieving widow. Wouldn't be right to see me out in the clubs in Wisconsin. You must protect me, Roy. I need you. - [Roy] Roy's here, baby. (dramatic music) (moaning) - I like having you around. Maybe you'll keep me from doing foolish things. - How foolish? - Well, after Fred died, I was afraid the robber was going to kill me, so bought a gun from the pawn shop. Just having it around makes me jumpy. - A Luger. You don't need that. Roy's here, now. (giggling) - So, you'll get rid of it for me? I just feel so much safer. - I'll do it when I go out of town for a couple weeks on business. When I get back, you and I are gonna start living. - Best news I've heard all day. - You slept with him. You enjoyed it. - I did what I had to do for us to get money for L.A., and I got him to toss the gun. I'm the one making sacrifices. - You didn't have to sleep with him. I'm not gonna share you anymore, do you understand? - You are forgetting the big picture, Otto. - Am I still in that picture? - Of course. (gentle music) Are you ready to move to Los Angeles? - I'm ready. What about him? - Let me do what I have to do to keep us safe. - [Otto] You gotta hand it to Dolly. Why let a little thing like murder stand in the way of your dreams? We were going to Hollywood to live the life we imagined. Or maybe it was just the life she imagined. ♪ Forbidden fruit ♪ Is just so appealing ♪ You see ♪ Who knew it could taste so sweet ♪ ♪ Baby don't panic ♪ Follow me ♪ Over the hills and far away ♪ To the city of broken dreams - Otto! - [Otto] Up here. - I read that Frances Marion wrote the film The Big House on Arroyo. Tell me you love it. - It's a knockout, of course. - What writer wouldn't be thrilled to work here? Soon you'll be writing for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. I'm making the right contacts for you. - [Otto] I want us to live together in the same bedroom every night. Will you marry me? - Oh, Otto. Someday, I'll marry you when we get to where we wanna be, but not until then. Besides, you're my lover. That's a much more important role. - If you won't marry me, I'm leaving. - Otto, look at me. You are an aspiring writer who sold exactly two stories. You don't have any other special skills unless you wanna go back to repairing sewing machines. Yet, you spend your days sitting here in this beautiful house writing and having sex with me. I doubt there's another writer in Hollywood that wouldn't jump at that opportunity. Now, if that doesn't make you happy, then you can get out. It would make me sad, but it's your choice. I'm throwing a party in two weeks, and I've invited the who's who of Hollywood to be there. I've even invited some Hollywood screenplay agents. - I'm not giving up on marriage. (mellow music) - Mrs. Oesterreich had me throw that in the river. You gonna go after her? - If you'd tossed into a bush instead, it might tell us more. - But I'm telling you, she did it. - If we did, we might have to come after you for aiding and abetting. Count your blessings. Let's find out where that greedy widow moved. (upbeat jazz music) - My friends tell me the only way a woman can get your attention is to commit a crime. - Have you? - No, but if that's what it takes. - My condolences. I understand he was murdered? - Still can't get the image of him lying there dead out of my mind. - Nobody ever can. - I'm afraid small-minded people in Milwaukee still think I was involved. - Well, maybe you'll need my services after all. (upbeat jazz music) - Welcome to Los Angeles, Mrs. Oesterreich. (people laughing) (upbeat jazz music) - Making a scene like that is reckless and dangerous, and you know it. - I'm sick of watching you throw yourself at other men. - You sound just like Fred. - Take this back. - Oh for god's sake. Let's go see a movie. A comedy, Marx Brothers, Animal Crackers... - I'm not in the mood. I don't feel like laughing. (phone rings) - Hello? Detective Cline? You're in Los Angeles? I understand. He wants to talk to me. - You mustn't meet him. - He'll get suspicious if I don't. I have to see him. He came all the way from... - Let's skip to Canada. Or Europe. Paris, this is our chance. Run away with me. All we need is each other. - And what, and what, live like a fugitive? You must be joking. (mellow music) Besides, I like living here. I'm finally making the kinds of friends I deserve. The life I've always dreamed of. - How do you think your fancy friends are gonna feel about you when you're arrested for murder? - Herman won't let that happen. - I don't have a Herman looking out for me. - You're a secret, Otto. Detective Cline doesn't know you exist. Neither does Herman. We keep it that way, we keep you safe. - [Otto] Bull, Dolly. You're just trying to save your own ass. - [Dolly] Do you understand? Otto? - They'll dog us forever. (melancholy music) - That's why I have to talk to Cline. I have to show him I have nothing to hide. - [Otto] Turns out, it ain't so easy to run from murder, even in Hollywood. Dolly was looking out for herself, but I had nobody looking out for me. (mellow music) - Herman Shapiro, Detective. I'm representing Mrs. Oesterreich. - [Dolly] Hello Detective. It seems some people will do anything to get out of Milwaukee. - Mrs. Oesterreich. You mind telling me what you and your late husband were fighting about at the Hofbrauhaus the night that he was murdered? - The usual marital disputes. - But I thought the two of you never fought? I recall you saying, you were more in love than ever. - What can I say, Detective, I wanted the fish for dinner. Fred thought the pork roast might put a little more blush on my cheeks. - And that's why you stormed out? - Where are we going with this, Detective? So they argued. I'm sure you argue with your wife. That doesn't mean you wanna kill her. - Fair enough, Counselor. I brought along an old friend. - I know you mean something by this, Detective, but I can't for the life of me think what it is. - You don't recognize this gun? - I do not. - Do you know Roy Klumb? - He was our insurance man. - And your lover? - In his dreams, perhaps. But I can't be responsible for what haunts Mr. Klumb's sleep. - Careful Detective, if this is a fishing expedition, I think you'll go home hungry. - Mr. Klumb says he's slept with you in your home, and then you asked him to toss this gun. - As I told you before, apparently Mr. Klumb has a very active fantasy life. And I see now you do too. - Detective, if this is the alleged murder weapon, what do the ballistics say? Are my client's fingerprints on the gun? That is now the new science of evidence. I didn't think so. - I'm sure we'll see each other again very soon. Counselor. - [Otto] She had the face of a Madonna, but a safe deposit box where her heart should be. - [Dolly] I can't thank you enough. I just feel so much safer with you by my side. - This is exactly where I want to be. - It's real Scotch. Glenfiddich. Don't ask where I got it. - [Herman] I never ask my clients for the truth. - Please. It's for you. As a token of my gratitude for what you've done for me, and what you will do. - Well, this is lovely, thank you. F.O.? - What? - The initials, F.O. are engraved on the back. Your husband's I assume? - Oh, I found it during the move to L.A. I didn't think to tell the police or the insurance company. Was that evil of me? - As your lawyer, this is a protected conversation. - And as my lover? - I should have seen how she would play this and run like hell. But she could smooth talk an angry beast into a house pet. Take it away. I'm on a hunger strike. - Don't be silly. You need your strength. - You don't need my strength, you've got Herman's. - Otto, I know I've hurt you over and over. I've taken years off of your life for my own greedy, selfish pleasure, and you've been nothing but loving to me. - You're a disease I can't shake. Why you torment me so I do love you? - And I love you, even if it's not always the way you want. I'm gonna do you a great favor. It'll hurt me deeply, but it's the only way to keep you safe from the police. - I don't like the sound of that. - I'm gonna keep seeing Herman until my legal troubles stop. He can't find out about you. The police either. It's just that it's too risky. - Kicking me out? - No, no. I wanna see you just like always every day. I've bought a beautiful place in Santa Monica. You can come and go as you please. - You just wanna get rid of me so you can sex up Herman. He's an attorney who can give you the life that you always wanted. - No, I'm doing this to protect you. Cline won't give up. If he finds out about you, we're cooked. We have to be careful now more than ever. - No. Not this time. I'm not giving in. - You're the one that messed up Fred's watch, not me. (dramatic music) (typewriter keys clacking) Don't you wanna be my lover anymore? (dramatic music) - [Otto] Sometimes a man has to find his spine. He has to stand up and say, I matter here. Even if nobody's listening. - Is this where you take all your girls? - Only the ones that matter. - Oh. And the ones that don't matter? - Frankfurters on Pico. (laughing) You are the most unsettling woman I've ever met, both thrilling and vaguely terrifying. - Is that a compliment? I can't tell. - I don't want it to end, how's that? Will you marry me? Is that your answer? ♪ A queen of my song ♪ List while I woo thee ♪ The soft melody ♪ Gone are the carolers of ♪ Life's busy throng - [Otto] Dolly treated me like a rubber band. She twisted and stretched me anyway she wanted. But sooner or later, even a rubber band will snap. Stop! - [Herman] Who the hell are you? - Tell him who we are to each other. - Dolly, what's he talking about? - This is Otto. He's my upstairs lodger. - Tell him! - He's... We used to be lovers. - Used to be? I haven't spoken to another man in nine years, so you're gonna shut your damn mouth and listen. I'm not her lover. I'm her sex slave. I used to be locked in her attic in Milwaukee while Fred was alive, and now here, I have sex with her on command. However, and when ever she wants, I have no control, and I have to listen to her sexing up marks like you. Oh. You thought she loved you. We're all her sex toys. The only thing with me and her, there ain't no pretending. Hell... - Don't listen to him, Herman. He's making this up. He does it all day. He a pulp fiction novelist. Tell him, Otto, tell him this is one of your stories. - Maybe I'll write about you next. - Boy was I wrong. You are more terrifying than thrilling. (suspenseful music) - Nobody, nobody murdered anybody here, tell him, Otto! Nobody murdered anybody! - Thing is, Dolly, I don't care anymore. I called Detective Cline. I refuse to live this way one more night. Had to live with your flirting, and had to live with the seductions because I understood why you were doing them. But you didn't have to take his ring. That spot was reserved for me. - No, no. - I'll be in the attic when the coppers arrive. - You wanna go to jail, fine! But I didn't murder Fred, remember that! - [Photographer] Otto, right here.

I'm so glad to see you. - Don't bother saying another word. I know it'll be a lie anyway. - I've missed you. How much, you have no idea. I want you to know that I would have married you, and I would have stayed faithful. I loved you, I still do. - You must think I'm a complete fool to fall for that again. - I would never think that about the man I wanna marry. - I don't believe you for a second. - Are you still gonna save me from prison? - The judge turned down our motion for a separate trial. You and Otto will be tried together for manslaughter. - But I didn't shoot Fred, he did. So what do we do? - Otto's lawyer will paint him as your puppet. He'll paint you as the puppet master pulling the strings. He'll say that Otto was carrying out your orders when he shot Fred. - But that's not true. - The truth has no defense here. It's the story that matters. He's more ... famous than Charlie Chaplin today. - You're in the public's eye. There is sympathy for their bat man. (melancholy music) - I need to go after Otto. It's you or him. If I can convict Otto, you'll go free. But I need your permission to do that. This is our best shot. - Perhaps being locked away will be less difficult for him than life alone on the outside. Do it. - [Otto] She knew just how to work a man. Then you'd wind up in an alley without your wallet or your pants. - Otto Sanhuber has confessed to murdering Fred Oesterreich. There is not of shred of physical evidence tying Mrs. Oesterreich to her husband's murder. Yes, Mrs. Oesterreich made mistakes. She was lonely. Yes, she cheated on her abusive husband. And yes, she took in a troubled orphan who had no where else to go. But you do not convict a woman of murder for the crime of infidelity. - Otto was just a teenager when he met Dolly. And orphan who had never known a day of love in his life. She was older, pretty, and boldly seductive. She took the best years of his life for her own selfish pleasure. - Settle. Quiet please. - You could have seen Otto at his tiny apartment or hotels, yet you moved him into the attic. Why is that? - When Fred began drinking, I didn't feel safe at the house. I thought having Otto there would keep me safe. - [Herman] Mr. Sanhuber asked you to marry him, did he not? - Otto professed his love to me constantly. He asked me to divorce my husband and marry him. - After Fred's death, why didn't you marry Otto then? (audience murmuring) - I adored him. But I take my marriage vows very seriously. - Liar! (audience gasps) - Now, now, take it easy. - Sit down, or you'll be in contempt. - You provoked your husband to yell and threaten you on more than one occasion, knowing that Mr. Sanhuber could hear you, didn't you? - Fred terrified me when he got angry. He slapped me more than once, and he tried to choke me. (audience murmuring) - Did you give your husband's Luger to Mr. Sanhuber? - I did. I wanted to keep it away from Fred. When he got drunk, he would wave that thing around like a crazy man. I was afraid he was gonna hurt himself, or me, with it. - You wanted Otto to have this gun, didn't you? You wanted to stir up his fear for your safety until he couldn't take it anymore, and that he'd use this gun on poor Mr. Oesterreich. Didn't you? - Otto was my guardian angel. I thought with him in the house, I could keep Fred from murdering me. - No. No, Mrs. Oesterreich. You kept him locked up in the house because you thought you could provoke him to murder your husband, didn't you? - [Herman] Objection, Your Honor. - Sustained. (audience murmuring) Order! - Otto was a sweet and lovely boy. I never imagined he would be capable of such a thing. Maybe it was all those crime stories he was reading and writing. I can't possibly know what would have made him murder Fred. - Didn't you stand to gain a lot of money if your husband died? - I knew Fred had a life insurance policy. - $20,000. (audience murmuring) - [Judge] Quiet down in my courtroom. - [Lawyer] You grew tired of Fred. You wanted to move to Los Angeles and lead a more glamorous lifestyle, but you couldn't do it without Fred's money. Isn't that right? - I moved to California to get away from the awful memory. - [Lawyer] No further questions, Your Honor. - Isn't it true, Mr. Sanhuber, that you wanted to marry Mrs. Oesterreich, but Fred was in the way. - I wanted to live openly as man and wife. But by then, I'd grown used to the attic. It felt safer up there. - What do you mean safer? Mrs. Oesterreich didn't make you live in the attic, did she? - No. I was grateful to be there. - The truth is you murdered Fred Oesterreich because you didn't want to share the love of your life with him anymore, isn't that right? - No. - You are not the tragic romantic you imagined yourself to be, are you? Gentlemen, my client gave this young man free room and board because she felt safer with him in the house. But he began to fantasize a life with her. This is a writer of lurid tales, someone who makes up stories of crime and sex, who imagined my client as one of his fictional damsels in distress. He could become her night in shining armor... (melancholy music) - The jury finds the defendant, Otto Sanhuber, guilty of manslaughter. (audience murmuring) As regards Mrs. Oesterreich, the jurors, having exhausted all means of deliberation, they are unable to reach a verdict. This court is adjourned. (audience murmuring) (upbeat music) - [Otto] Dolly got what she wanted. But then, she always did. She used sex as a weapon and love as a drug. But she made my life exciting. She gave me something to write about. (upbeat music) (upbeat jazz music)
