911, what's your emergency? What's your emergency, Sir? Ok, what's the address? Sir, Sir, what address? Earthquake Reaction shot. Farhang is going to kill me when he sees your price tag. Look who's home. Hi, Hunny. Hi, how are you? Look what I got. Look what I got. Hold on a sec, wait, wait. Say hello again. Hello. Say it again. Hello, hello. Say it one more time. Hey. My mics working. That's a cool thing. Isn't it beautiful? You got that today? I did. Do I just talk into the... Can I come in? Yeah, come in, come in. The camera's not here. Just pretend the camera's not here. Pretend it's... Ok. Yeah, pretend it's not there. Can I see it? Yeah, you wanna see it? Yeah. You gonna come get it? You're going to fall and you're going to break your brand new camera that you just bought. No, no, no you're going to break it. Don't wrestle for it. What're you doing? Up in your grill. Whatcha doing? Reading. Show us some skin. Ok, ok, come on. Do you have to be filming me reading? I'm filming everything. It's really weird having that thing in my face. Really? You don't like it? You don't like having it up in your face? Farhang, you're going to break it. How do you like it, huh? Do I look ok? You look great. Mhm? Yeah. Yeah. Mhm. Wow, you really like this whole directorial role. Oh my god, yes. So we have to film everything right? Everything. Mhm? Mhm. Hold on a sec, get a high angle. Look. What do you think? I think I really like this camera. Yeah? Yeah. Could you give me a massage? Yes, I can. Here, let me put this down. Baby. Baby. You asleep? Mhm. Welcome to Blue Balls, the movie. A table saw, really? But it's more efficient, right? We don't have to use man power. It's not wide enough. Yeah, ok. Well there's a huge one there. Jesus. Look at the teeth on it. Look at the teeth. I feel like I'm in a video game. Pew pew pew. Ok. It's actually not even that heavy. I could do this. Saftey orange seems a little ironic. What about this? It's like a lobotomy. You have hold things like not an insane person. Would this be enough? Do you think this would work for like fingerprints? Bleach. We're going to have to clean up the body and disinfect it and everything anyways, so like... Shh, Baby. What? Oh, we need a caulking gun. A caulking gun? What for? For the windows. For the windows? Yeah, in the den and also in the... Ok, give me the camera. What? What do we need next that isn't a caulking gun? We need a tarp. Some caulking. Go, Baby, go. So what's the next thing we need? Oh, here. Tarp, rags, stuff. We should probably get some rags. Rat poison, would that be enough do you think? Are you sure we should get two? Yes, we need two. Unless, do you want to do all the digging? Do you want to do all the digging? Yeah, ok. Alright. Can I just take the camera and you take the lead again? Yes, yes, Babe. You know what, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You did good. You did really good. And you know what? We can get the caulking gun, ok? Ok. I like the weight. Have you ever even held an ax before? I think it looks like I have, don't you? It might be a little bit small maybe. What's the size on this? Baby, put that down. Don't put it to your neck. I'm just playing around, nobody's going to be, oh my god. Whatever, we're getting it. Look who's studying. Hey Babe. Hey. So I understand the medical books to a certain extent. I think it's over kill. But this print out... You'd be amazed at the resources out there. So many people think about this. This is really fucked up. This is like from the deep dark... Are you calling me fucked up because I'm doing my research? No, but this is fucked up. Pull out the teeth and smash them. Babe, we need the information. We can't go into this competely blind. What would you do? You can kill someone with your bare hands. They make guns. If a gun is too noisy then you can use a bat. You hit them in the face. Also, blood everywhere. Just everywhere. It's really easy. You just, you kill them with any of the ways that I just said and then you chop them up and then you're done. How would you? Ok, take the camera. Sit down. I'm going to sit. Ok. We'd have to knock them out first, obviously right? Ok. Something to make them sleep and then I'd take them down to the basement because it's quiet and there's no windows. You tie them up down there while he's sleeping, but then you have to wait for him to wake up first, right. This is key. I'd probably throttle him somehow. Like take a rope or a belt because it's quiet and it's quick and you can really like feel them move. Like you feel them move. You can probably even hear them fight for the breath. Oh, god. Ok. You can take them in the bathtub and you'd drain them out. So you'd probably start by slitting his throat and let that bleed out a little bit. After you drain them out, then you'd have to chop them up into little pieces with a power saw. A quick one. Like a saber saw? Yes, whatever that is. Yeah, you have to chop them up. It would go right through like butter, like something with some serious power behind it. The hands, you have to get rid of the fingerprints, so you could either chop that up with razors or you could blow torch it, melt it off. I think that's the most efficient way to do it. Oh the head, the head, the teeth, we'd have to get a pair of pliers and rip the teeth out because they can identify you from your dentals so you just. You would need to wrap the pieces up individually, yeah? Mhm. And you put them in garbage bags. And we would leave them in the freezer, because you know, we don't want it to stink. And then, we put him in garbage bags, put him in the car, take him out somewhere quiet and secluded, bury the pieces and he never comes back. What do you think? You know it could really be anybody. Let's go kill those bros. They're like that's hot, Bro, let's like go get some slushies. Fuck some bitches. If I were to kill anybody, it would probably be my boss. Or the fucking IT guy that doesn't know how to say my name. The guy, what did he call you? Jorge, that was it. Fucking Jorge, let's kill Jorge. No, that's a little too close, love, it has to be random. It can't be somebody that either of us knows. Look at them. It's like a buffet. It's like pick you lobster out of the tank. What about that girl right there? She looks a bit young. I think it's pretty safe to rule out kids. Yeah. Not children. I'm not a child killer. That's just fucked up. I mean we could go for teenagers because everybody hates teenagers. There's gotta be at least one person who would thank us for killing any given teenager. But you never know, they could always get better. I would rather it not be a woman. Why not? If people find out, they're going to think it's like some weird like rapey sex thing. Just because you kill a woman doesn't mean you raped her. Tell that to every other serial killer. They test a woman to see if she was raped. Yeah, but they would immediately assume that I was... Why would they assume that? We're not going to get caught. You have completely the wrong mentality with this. You're talking like we're going to get caught and it'll be less bad as opposed to if we do it properly and never get caught at all. I'm just talking in hypotheticals. I know. I would say no pregnant women for sure. Maybe not old people. Like old within reason. Let's say like 20 to 50. No handicaps, I think. Nobody that's handicapped. I just want to be completely sure that they are 100% aware of what is going on and what's happening to them as it happens, you know? Yeah. Yeah, they have to know. And I can't guarantee that if it's someone that's mentally handicapped and that's not me holding anything against that group, it's just my not knowing. It defeats the purpose of why I'm doing this, why we're doing this, if we don't know. What about physically handicapped? No. Really? Cripples? What's wrong with you, Farhang? Like, their life is bad enough. Well, I think we need to establish some ground rules. And I think we've established a few. All right, so what else are your ground rules? No gay guys. What? Seriously? Farhang, I did not think you were like that. No, what I'm saying is not to kill anybody that's homosexual. Why would you think that? Because then it looks like a hate crime. Nobody that's a minority. What? Because then again, it's like a hate crime. Farhang, you're a minority. Yeah. You have been homophobic, racist and sexist. By saying that I don't want to kill gay people, minorities and women? I think it should be equal murder opportunity for everyone. I'm giving them life opportunities. Just live and flourish. Farhang, I need your help with something. I need your help. Can you come with me please? Is everything ok? Yes, yes, there's just a thing in the basement, it's not fitting and I need assistance. Come, come, come. Can it wait? No, it can't, come, it's gotta be now. Now. We're going, come on. Ok. Into the bathroom? Yes, into the bathroom. Come here. I don't think it's big enough. Seriously. Big enough for what? It's not going to fit a whole body in there. Bathtubs are made to fit a whole body. That's like the whole purpose of a bathtub. Get in the tub? Yeah, yeah. It might be wet. No, lie down. Lie down, lie down. Lie down? Yeah, lie down. We need to see if you fit. It's totally wet. Quit your bitching. My socks are going to be wet. Lie down, like a body. Like a dead body? Yeah, like a dead body. If he's bigger, look, ok, here give me the camera. Babe, I think we might need to buy another tub. No, no, come here. Get on your knees. Seriously? Just get on your knees. You want me to get down on my knees? Yes. Ok. So, check it out. So we drain body part by body part. All right? Give me your arm. We take the forearm and we make an incision up along like the major arteries and we drain it into the tub. Then we grab the neck... Then we can drain it in this way, yeah? Yeah. Right? And then, here... So put the other arm up and then we drain that arm, ok? Yeah. And then we can cut along the sides along the major arteries, where the organs are. Yeah. I have to fuck. Fuck. Bend over. Oh, these are dirty. Where did all the squirrels go? Nice camera. Oh thanks. How's it going, man? Pretty good. Is it ok if I film you? Yeah, sure, are you a photographer or something? Budding director, I think. Budding director, eh? What's your name? Gary. I'm Jen. Jen. Nice to meet you. Jen the director. Where do I fit into this movie of yours? I'm not sure yet. What? Need a hero? I do. With me as your lead, you know, I'm willing to go anywhere and do anything. You don't have to pay me millions of dollars. So less of an investment. Got an open schedule. Ah, you're really selling me on this, Gary. You look like a star. If you're going to be a big star, Gary, I need to get a full shot of you. Come here. Can I stand you up? My god, you are tall. Look at you. Work that camera. You look fantastic. Oh, sorry, man. Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me. Unbelievable. Sorry, I didn't see you there. Come on, fuck. Are you ok? Just... Watch it will you. If you weren't backing up. She didn't mean nothing by it. Buddy, look, just hands off, ok? I got nothing for you. Hey, he was just trying to help me, man. Relax. Look, if you didn't back up and bump into me, is that thing on? Get it out of my face. Ok, it's off. I'm filming Gary. Fine, keep filming Gary. He's more interesting anyway. Fucking bitch. Excuse me? I'm sorry, can I get that one more time on camera, please? What was that? Look, I already told you, get that out of my face. Back off. I am backed off, I'm no where near you. Shut it off, shut it off. I don't have to shut it off. What are you going to do about it? This is un-fucking-believable. Get that shit out of my face. Touch my fucking camera and I will kill you. Oh really? You know what, this is perfect, because my movie needs a fucking villian, you piece of shit. Oh, you're filming a movie, you're going to be a famous director or something, right? Great, good luck with that. Good luck with that. You'll get yours, keep walking. Yeah, see ya, you slut. Bye. Fucking... You are a piece of work. Can you believe that guy, Gary? Can't all be winners. You know what? Huh? Here. You sure? Yeah, grab something warm for dinner tonight. Jen the director, right? Yeah. Gary my star. God bless, all right? Yeah, take care, man. Yes, oh god. And thus exits our villian. How the other half lives. Shit, there's a Mrs. Douchebag. What kind of woman marries a guy like that? Fucking cunt. Hey. Farhang? Hello? Farhang? What? Farhang, for god's sake. Hi. Hey. Hi. How's it going? Why is there meat in the bathtub? You know, I figured if we're going to do the body in here, right? So this way we can practice and you know work out all the logistics. This thing is amazing. How was your day? Can you turn that off please? Yeah, sure, what's up? I just got fucking yelled at by this asshole in the street. Yeah, I was filming this really nice guy and I accidently backed into him. He called me a fucking cunt. What? Yeah, I know. Don't worry, we'll cut him up with this awesome new saber saw that I just got. Huh? Huh? 42% off. I found a knick on the box. You wouldn't even believe this guy. Nobody would miss him, he's just such a piece of shit. Yeah? Yeah, it's just like, he just wouldn't leave it alone. Sounds like an asshole. Hey, Babe. Got the tarp and I also got a surprise. Sweet. Sweet. Shall we roll it out? Sure. Cool. Look out. Document the whole process. Just like right here? Here, just roll it my way. Perfect. This really folds out well. Yeah. Why do we need a tarp? Well, cause bodies are messy, Love. Yeah, but I thought we were going to, like, minimize the spillage. Yeah, but I mean for saftey's sake, you don't want DNA on the floor, like, you know, they can find that shit even if you clean it, and dead bodies shit, obviously. So yeah. For real? Like actually? So what was the other thing you got? Oh. I got some handcuffs, so we can restrain the body. These are a little light, Babe. They're a little light. I got them from the sex shop. You got them from a fucking sex shop? Farhang, these are designed to be able to get out of. I can get out of these in like five seconds. Yeah, they're in front of you though. Like if they were behind your back, you wouldn't be able to see how they work. Right you are. Let's test that theory, shall we? Can I have the camera please? You're very right, they were in front of my body. So if you put them behind. Baby, Jesus. How's that work? That tight enough? Tight? That's like really fucking tight. Down you go. Down. Jesus. Baby, that actually really fucking hurts. Yeah? Yes. All right, better? Fuck. Over you go. Does it hurt to lie on them? They're behind your back though. Can you get out of them? No, I can't. No, you can't get out of them. Please, please. What? Please, Baby. What, they're not supposed to be comfortable. Please. Get out of them. Just get out of them. You proved your point, they really fucking hurt. Can you just get them off me please? Roll over. I'm going to leave you alone with my camera and these handcuffs and whenever you're out of them you can come up. Turn it off when you're done please. Fuck. Hi, guys. Hey, honey, how are you? Good. Hey, mom. Hi. How are you? Hey, I can't... How's it going? What's new? Not much. Come sit with mommy. It's good to see ya. Nice to see you too. We're making a movie. What's with this? It's new. Well, why did you buy that? There's one downstairs you could have had. That one is new and shiny. Oh, like the old one. Do you still have any of the tapes? Oh my god. I wonder what's down there. Can I go through the box? Sure. I want to go through the box and see what's in there. Why are you filming this? We're sort of documenting everything, actually. We took it to the hardware store with us, I take it out on walks, I take it driving. Documentary? Yeah, exactly. Like a documentary. Do you still have those tapes that she would make when she was younger? I've got some of them, yeah. Yeah, I would love to see them. Like what kind of stuff did she film. What did she film. Stuff like what you're doing now. Sticking a camera in everyone's face and bugging them. Yeah. There's this one time, like when I was a little kid, I didn't believe that cats always landed on their feet and I might have filmed this, it might be in one of the tapes. Oh my god. Where I didn't believe that cats always land on their feet, so I took Toto up to the top of the stairs and held him on his back and dropped him. Not like down the stairs, like down on the landing to see if he would land on his feet and I might have filmed that. You might have filmed that. Sarah got really mad when I did it to her cat though. I'll bet she was. He was fine. Nothing happened. He didn't die or anything. But he did land on his feet. They do, they twist very quickly. Although there is a terminal velocity of cats. They found this out in New York from statistics of cats falling out of high rises. Below something like the sixth or the seventh floor, they turn and they can land. From sixth to like the fifteenth floor, they die and above that they land on their feet and if they don't break all of their legs, they actually hit a terminal velocity, can figure out how fast they're going and right themselves so they can land. Wow. So like if you live in an apartment building on the floor between six and 15, your cats are goners, but if you're below or above, you're good. Hi Jen. Jennifer Leigh. Hi. Say something intelligent, Jennifer. Yum, yum. Yum. Hello, welcome to the future. Space technology has allowed us to voyage beyond our star. This is so cool. This is amazing. It sucks, this thing weighs like, it's like two dead babies in weight. This camera is the coolest horrible thing. It's huge. Yeah, it's amazing. What're you doing? Nothing, just going through some old movies I made. I don't even remember this one. You made all of these? Most of them, yeah. I mean some of them are just like filmed movies off the TV, but most of them are mine. That's awesome. This is what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to make movies. But we're making this one now, right? So, it's ok. Come on. Let's go for a walk. Film some stuff. I'm bringing this camera. You know what, fine. We can take it with us, as long as you don't forget the real camera. And you can play with that piece of crap while I continue our movie. Perfect. Yeah. I'll shoot a better movie with this. Those can stay there and never see the light of day again. I just don't get why this guy specifically. Like why do we have to follow this guy? Well, for one he called me a cunt. Thanks for the loyalty. Well yeah, but is that a reason to kill somebody? Like, if somebody called me an asshole, you would kill them? Yes. Hell yes I would. Are you kidding me? Yeah. Can we just write him off as an asshole and then go home? Tandem bike. You know what sucks about stake outs? The whole stake out part. It seems so much shorter in movies, but they're always tired. It's because they cut it together. They only keep the interesting bits, love. In our movie, when this is all done and we're making up our movie and putting it together, this isn't going to be in it, there's only going to be the interesting parts. This bullshit that you're saying right now, thank god, will never see the light of day. I don't think what I say is bullshit. What if he has guests? And we're just outside his house. They just come out like, "Ok, bye. Thanks for having us. Woah, what are these strangers doing?" Shhh, Farhang, look, look, look. There he is. Oh shit. Oh, are they fighting? Doesn't he look like a complete asshole? Farhang, I want you to follow him. What? Follow him. Baby, oh my god. Go, go, go, go. Go, drive. Go, drive, go. Farhang, drive, go, go, go please. We're going to lose him. It's exciting now, isn't it? It's way more illegal. Why are we following him? Where are we going? We're following him, we don't know where we're going. We're going where he's going. I just want to know more about him. Like who is this person? What kind of life do they lead? Aren't you supposed to not make it personal? Like the less you know... Maybe, but I'm curious. And this guy's a piece of shit, I want to see how deep that goes. Oh, he's stopping. What should I do? Just go ahead, drive ahead. He's going to see us. No he's not, he's not even looking. Pull up here. Where is he going? This is not your house, Mister. Could be anybody's house. Visiting a friend. I don't think this guy has friends. Look at her. Yeah, Farhang, he's visiting a friend. He fucking called me a slut, he has a fucking slut. We should get out of here. Love, come on, he has a mistress. It couldn't get any better. That's not any of our business. I don't give a fuck about this guy, I don't care what he does. We should get out of here, he's going to fucking look at us. Ok, ok, all right. Let's go. Bye bye, asshole, we'll be back. God, he's perfect, he's perfect. So I think we've got everything that we need, right? We know where he lives, and we know what his routine is, if he goes missing, there's motive. Oh god, this could not get any better. I'm so glad, McDouche turned out to be what I thought he was. I just don't know. He's perfect. Jen, you're making this so personal. No, I'm not. You said that it should not be personal because that's traceable and now you're making it personal. No, I'm not making it personal, I'm pointing out what an obvious piece of shit he is. I'm not debating whether or not he's an asshole, you're just making it personal by observing his asshole behavior and having an opinion about it. You know what, fine, fine. If we kill somebody else, it's fucking on you. It's on you. Farhang, wake up. Farhang, wake up. Hello, wake up. What's wrong? Are you ok? Good, you're awake. Ow, what's going on? Yes, we're awake? Are you listening? Are you filming right now? Yes, I'm filming. When is this going to happen? Soon, Baby, soon. Keep your eyes open. Look at me. Ok, ok, ok, I'm up. Are you serious about this? Yes, I'm serious about this. Do you promise? Yes, I am. It's just not the time to talk right now. No, now is exactly the time. Ok, get out of bed, I've got to show you something. What? Get out, get out, get out of bed. Go, get out of bed. You think I'm joking, go. Get out of bed, go. So, what're we doing? Where are we going? Keep your voice down. We're here. I know you live around here somewhere. I know he's around here. Can we just do this tomorrow? Which house is your house? Come on, come on. I don't know what I'm coming on to. What're we doing? Can you tell me what's going on? No, you'll know him when you see him. You'll see. Babe, I think I saw him. I think he's down there. I found you. Come on, Buddy. I know he's back here. Shhh. We're not going to get caught. I know he's back here somewhere. Go on, go on. It's just a motion sensor, calm down. He's around here. I saw him, I saw him, he's here. Farhang, take the camera. Take it, take it, take it. Come here, kitty. Come here. Baby. Got you. Have you seen my friend? Hello, Buddy. Ok, ok, let's go. Can you put him back please? What the fuck? Isn't he sweet? You are just the cutest. Baby, ok, I think we should take the cat back, Baby. No, the cat's not coming back. Kitty's going to go for a little swim What's that suppose to mean? Could you do me a favor and fill up the sink please? Baby... Can we please take the cat back now? I don't want to be a catnapper. He's just a cat. You're just a cat. Yeah, someone else's cat. They're going to be concerned when they notice that their cat is gone. Farhang, it's just a fucking cat. If you can't do this with a cat, how are you going to do this with a person? Could you please do me a favor and fill up the sink? Yes, do you like water? Oh my god, fuck. We'll name you Davey Jones. Look how sweet he is. Baby. Baby. Listen you've proved your point ok? Can you just... Relax, Farhang, it's not even a big deal. It's not even a big deal. Bye bye. Baby. The kitty is saying goodbye. Look, look, he likes it, he's looking right at it. Jen, Jen, please, Jen. Babe, could you do me a favor and get me a bag? Please, like a garbage bag? Something plastic. Are you serious? Yes, I'm serious, can you please just go get a bag? My arms are full right now. Baby. My arms are full with Davey Jones. Jen, Jen, please. Jen, can we please... Farhang, could you go fucking do it, please? Ok, ok. You proved your point, ok? Jen, Jen. Stop, stop, stop, stop right now. Stop, Baby. Baby, please. Shut up. Shut up or I'm going to make you do this. Do you want to fucking do this? Stop, baby, stop. Baby, oh my fucking god. Holy fuck. Holy fuck, Jen. Fucking cat tore me to shit. Fuck me. It wanted to go swimming. Oh my god. Oh, Baby was that hard? It's just a fucking cat. Don't be such a baby. It's going to be a lot easier with a person, don't worry. Can you do me a favor and clean this up? I'm really tired and I want to go to bed, ok? Just put him in a dry garbage bag and put him in the freezer and we can drop it off at a park tomorrow or something. Ok? Morning. Good morning. How's it going? It's going well. Oh, you're looking good today. Yeah, I have like a year end review kind of thing. Oh babe, you're going to kill it, you look fantastic. I like the tie combo. Thank you. Are you not going into work today? Oh, I'm playing hooky. Are you ok? You seem a little bit upset about last night. No, no. Are you sure? No, it's fine. It's fine. I should probably get going. Yeah. Come here, give me a kiss. You'll be great, you'll be great today. I believe in you. And I have a busy day too. Shh. He should be somewhere around here. Ah, there he is. Hey, Gary. Oh, hey. What's going on? Not a whole lot. You remembered me. Of course I remembered you. It's Jen the director lady, right? Yeah, sure is. How's your movie coming? The big picture? It's really coming along. You know what, actually, I think it's almost done. So I had this idea, and feel free to say no if you want, but I was wondering if you grace us with your presence for dinner tonight. At my house? Yeah, sure, sure. Yeah? Yeah. Really? Yeah. Oh great, I'm so excited. I'm really glad. Does tonight work for you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm parked around the corner. Let's go. Right now? Yeah, right now. I got to get my things together. Of course, of course. I gotta tidy up the place, lock the door before we leave. Yeah, yeah, you don't want to get your stuff jacked. You don't mind if I film you while we go? No, sure, that's fine. You're my muse, Gary. Thank you, thank you. This one right here. Just throw your stuff anywhere, wherever you're comfortable. Ok. Look at you, the camera loves you. Hey, do you want to try? Yeah, sure. Yeah, take it, take it. Go for it. Give her a shot. Just play with it. Ok. That's how I figured it out. This makes it longer and shorter. That's zooming in and zooming out. Look it, you're a natural. Our starlett. What do you like to eat, Gary? I don't know, I'm sure anything you want to make is going to be great. And what about dessert? Oh boy, dessert? Yeah. I don't know what do you like? I make pretty good apple pie, if we're going like, American classic. American classic, that sounds good. All right, let's do it, we'll do apple pie. Good to go? Yeah, good to go. Don't forget your seatbelt, we don't want you dying on the way there. Yeah, sure. Make yourself at home, please. Drop your coat anywhere. Yeah, sure. Bannister, couch. Bannister, ok. Tell you what, Gary, I'm just going to get dinner started, so why don't we get you in a hot shower, I'll grab you a towel. Are you sure? Yeah, yeah, no, please, please. Get you cleaned up and warmed up and what not. Ok. I'm sure I have some of my dad's clothes kicking around somewhere I can grab you. Right up the stairs behind you. I'll grab you a towel. All right, up here? Yeah, yeah, right up that way. Get a hot shower going for you while I start dinner. Ok. Hey. Hey, Babe. How's it going? Good, how are you? Welcome home, Sweetie. You're cooking. That smells incredible. Yeah, I'm making us dinner and I have a little surprise. Hello? Yeah, just down here, Gary. Come on down. Hey, hey, you must be Farhang, right? Hi. Gary. Gary. Farhang, where's that name from? It's a Persian name. Ok, yeah, yeah. Me and my buddy, Kenny, we were at this Ethiopian place the other day and we bit of extra money and they have this like, soggy bread, it's kind of weird. And everyone's always saying jokes about Ethiopia, how they don't have much food. But they actually have, like the servings are huge. It's crazy. I know you like it right? That's great, Jen, do you mind, can we talk in the kitchen? Sorry to... Ok, yeah. Sorry, he's just going to help me out with something, Gary. Why don't you sit down on the couch, you can turn the TV on, you know, make yourself comfortable. We'll be back in just a sec, all right? Yeah. What's going on? Who is that? That's Gary. He's going to be our dinner guest tonight. And I thought you know, he could use a hot meal and a hot shower. Why is he here? Because I'd like to move things along and get some stuff done and I'm the person to do it it seems. So I'm just going... So why don't you go in, keep Gary company while I finish up dinner. What do you mean move things along? We never talked about this. It doesn't matter. Just go keep Gary company. Chat with him, he's really nice, actually. So go. I'm going to stay in here and get things done. Yeah. And I'm going to get dinner done. Ok? It'll be great, I promise. Hey, where'd you get this coasters? They're really cool. I think my mom gave them to us. They're made of like glass or something? Oh man, this pork is like, it's just right. I don't know what you did with it or whatever, it's like, I don't know it's like soft on the inside but not gross soft, but like a good soft. It's a shame though, pork is so good and only some people eat it. You know like, some religions are just like, no, I don't want any. I don't know why but I don't know. It's good, it's good, good stuff. Those people are missing out. Sweetie, you're not eating. Is there something wrong with your pork chop? No, I just had a late lunch is all. Oh. It's a shame, man, it's good stuff. I'm just not hungry is all. You know what I think you need? I know what I need is a glass of wine. Gary, wine? Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's do it. Great, great. Farhang, wine? I know you want wine. Sure. Perfect, perfect. Gary, would you do me a huge favor and hold the camera for me while I grab us some libations please? Ok. For using it in the movie? Yeah, yeah, I really want to see your perspective. Ok, I'll give it a shot. You remember where the zoom is. Yeah I think so. I think so. You'll be fine. Farhang in the film. Yeah? He's like a leading role. Leading role. So what's your plan for how to end the movie, or I guess you can't really plan it, it's like when you make a documentary, it just sort of happens. It's not really my movie, it's more her thing. That's for you, Gary. There you go, Sweetheart. Here I can take the camera back from you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cheers, Gents. Gary, here's to your health. Oh, yeah, I mean, I should, you guys are hosting. So I should maybe do something, like maybe say a cheers or whatever, or a toast. That's really sweet of you, Gary. Go ahead. Yeah, I was just thinking like, you know, it's pretty cool how like you know, a lot of people, they don't really, you guys treated me like family, like Farhang's been really nice and that's cool. And just like most people don't treat you like family, me and Kenny we're always saying like at the shelter they just kind of move you through and check a box. And they're just like, yeah, ok. So yeah, thanks, thanks to you guys. Cheers. Cheers, Gary. Awesome. How's that wine treatin' ya? It's good, yeah. Good wine. Really good wine. Well there's a whole other bottle where that came from. Nice. Please, drink your fill. Farhang, it's rude not to drink at a toast, sweetie. You know why people cheers? It's actually a show of faith that when you clink your glasses together you get some of your wine in their cup and they get some of theirs into yours as a show of faith that you're not actually poisoning them. Oh. Isn't that cool? That's where cheersing comes from. Cool. Cool. So drink up, Farhang. We did our show of faith. Yeah, it's not like she poisoned your wine. That is really good. You're not going to have any? I mean... Farhang, drink up. I don't mean, I don't know, this is your meal, so it's... Listen, it's getting kind of late. You must be getting tired. How about, I can take you over to a hotel, I can get you a room to stay over night. Yeah, sure, don't worry about it. I know it's a lot of stuff to deal with. Gary, please don't. He didn't mean it. I wake up early for work, and I don't want you to have to wake up early. You guys have already done a lot. Please, Gary, please sit down. Farhang. Please, you can't leave without having dessert, I made pie. Gary, sit, please. At least stay for dessert. Ok, please? Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry, Farhang, he didn't mean it. He's just cranky after a long day at work. Sweetie, will you help me with dessert please? Now. What the fuck was that? What is he doing in our house? Just tell me what he's doing in our house please. Farhang, is it so unreasonable that a guy can get some charity and a warm meal and a hot shower. Yes, it is, that's bullshit. Tell me what he's doing here. Farhang, this is happening sooner or later, I'm just getting the ball rolling. I'm not ready for it, you can't just spring this on me. Jen, you can't just bring someone home and poison them and leave them in our house. Farhang, I didn't poison him. I didn't poison him. Well, I can't do this. I can't do this today. Fine, fine, you're right. I didn't tell you, so what? Screw it, let's just have some dessert and then we'll send Gary on his way. Did you poison the wine? No I did not poison the wine. I didn't poison the wine. I promise. You had the wine, I had the wine. I didn't poison the wine. Could you grab the pie for me please? We'll just have some dessert and we'll send Gary on his way. If you still really want to get him a hotel room, you can get him a hotel room. Ok? Give me the pie. Promise me you didn't poison the wine. I promise you I didn't poison the wine. Give me the pie. Did you poison the pie? Honey, I will eat the entire pie right in front of you if that's what you want. The pie is perfectly fine. Ok? Ok. Now give me the pie. Go apologize to Gary. Ok. So rude. What the fuck did you do? What the fuck did you do? Oh, Gary. One too many glasses of wine, Gary? Want some pie? Want some dessert, Gary? You just lied to me. Baby, I told you I didn't poison him. He's not poisoned. Well, what the fuck is he doing? He's fucking dead. No he's not. Look, he's breathing. He's perfectly alive and well. He's asleep. Aren't you, Gary? He's just a little sleepy. He's a sleepy Gary. I can't do this, I can't do this. He looks so peaceful. Farhang, it's fine, it's fine. We are so prepared for this. Why did you bring a fucking stranger into our house and poison him. What the fuck is wrong with you? I didn't poison him. What the fuck is wrong with you? I knocked him out. There's a huge difference. I wouldn't poison some random person. I can't do this, I can't fucking do this. Farhang, yes, you can. I can't fucking do this, Baby, I can't. I can't, can't, I can't. Shut up. Shut the fuck up. Farhang, shut the fuck up. We have been, we have been... Shut the fuck up. We have been preparing for this for months, you are not taking this away from me. Ok? No, sit. Get over here. I'm not fucking doing this. Farhang, then what are you going to do? You just going to leave this guy in our house? I'm not fucking doing this. I'm getting out of this fucking house. All right, you're going to leave this guy in our house to wake up or call the cops. You're fucking ruining my fucking life. I can't fucking do this. I'm not fucking touching him. I'm not touching him. Get the fuck away from me. Farhang. You lied to me. I didn't lie to you. You lied to me. We're ready for this. Get him up. Get him up. For fuck's sake, you're being a fucking pussy. Crying about this. Acting like this is coming out of goddamn no where. I can't fucking do this. Fuck, get up. Get the arm. Ok, get it. Get it, stop crying. See, this is why I need your fucking help. Oh, Gary. Not my first choice, but you will do beautifully. Hey babe, do you have everything? Yeah. Good. Hey, Gary. Rise and shine. Wake up, wake up, wake up. Wake up, Gary. Hey, Gary. What are you waiting for? He has to be awake. He has to know. Hi, Gary. Morning. Hey, hey, hey, no it's ok. Remember me? Jen with the camera? This big director lady, making a movie. Remember? Shhh, it's ok. It's ok, you're being a star. Remember me, with the camera? Shh, Gary, Gary, Gary, shhh. Listen to me. Look at me, look at me, look at me. Look at me, look at me. Hi, it's ok. It's all right. No, no, no it's a great thing that you're doing. Shhh. Shhh. Farhang, can you come get the camera, please? Now. Can you take the damn camera? For god's sake, take the fucking camera. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I can't, I can't. Baby, no, I can't. Farhang, don't you take that fucking camera off. After all the work we put into this, you don't turn that god damn camera off. Ever. Don't move that god damn camera, otherwise I've got fucking nothing, you're ruining my shot. Are we ready? I'm really sorry that we have to do this twice. It was suppose to go right the first time. Farhang, he's going to break the chair. Farhang, put the camera down, I need your help. Can you help me please? Shhh. He's almost there. He's almost there. Pull. Oh my god. Holy shit. He bit down so hard it won't come out. Come here, come here. Ok. Now the hard part. So they don't call it dead weight for nothing. We've learned, what did we learn today? Can you be careful with the knife? Yes, yes, this is a tool, not a toy. Gary's a big boy. Aren't you, Gary? You're doing a good job. So we're gonna bleed him out now. I imagine it's like sticking a pig. I've never stuck a pig before. But it's like prom night for murder. Gary, you're taking my kill virginity, I'm stoked. Are you stoked? Babe, can you put that down so we can get all of that brutal glory? It's going to be so exciting. You ready, Gary? That was awesome. Holy shit. You're bloody guy, Gary. Babe, you wanna hand me the bleach? Yeah. Thanks, Babe. So we just got to let him, you know, drain for a little while then we'll chop up the rest, yeah? Shall we? Oh, that's awesome. Be careful. The power between my legs. This was a good buy, Babe. Good buy, good job. Alright cool, give me the camera. Switch. What? Switch. Farhang, switch. No. What do you mean, no? You can just do it. Don't be such a fucking baby. I bled him out from the neck. Yeah, you can do the rest. Take the saber saw. Just grab it and you do it. You practiced, don't be such a baby. It's easy, you just press the button, and it works. Oh my god. We have a decomposing body in our bathtub right now. You don't need practice, you can just do it. It's not about practice, it's about, I did that part and now it's your turn to do yours. Give me the camera. Give me the camera, switch. I brought you a garbage bag. Are you going to help me with this? I'm filming, Babe. I have my own job to do. Ok, Babe, good job. Yep, just give it a... I think red is really your color, Sweetheart. Jeez, Gary is starting to stank. Here... Babe. He's decomposing, we have to get this done tonight. Babe, all of that is not going to fit in that tiny little.. Yeah, yeah, ok. You think you can do some or? Babe, I am documenting all of this. It's an important job too, you know, seriously. Looking good, Gary. Can you not call him that? Call him what? Can you not... What, call him Gary? Babe. Just don't use his name, it's really fucked up that you're using his name. Well, he was a person, I think we should pay some respect to that. It's fucking starting to smell. That's why we need to get him in the freezer, Babe. Blood fucking all over me. You're doing a really good job, Babe. We're almost there. We're almost there. Just take a minute. Take whatever time you need but we need to get him in the freezer before he starts to stink any more. Did you hear that? What the fuck was that? I think it sounded like the door, Babe. Oh, yeah. That was definitely the door. Do you think somebody heard something? They know that we're home. Our fucking lights are on. Ok, fine, you know what, I'll go see what it is. You've got blood on you. I'll put a sweater on. Here, I'll take the mic, you take the headphones. You'll be able to hear everything that's going on. Ok? Just stay here, stay quiet and I will be right back, ok? Take the camera. All right? Hi. I am really sorry to bother you, I am looking for my cat, his name is mittens, this is the picture. What an adorable kitty. How long has he been missing? In the night he went out and he didn't come back in the morning. Oh, Honey, I'm so sorry to hear that. You know I had the cutest little thing that looked just like that when I was a kid. It was devestatng when he ran away. Just all day walking around, and all these cars are driving so fast and these dogs and things around. Well, I haven't seen him. I'll ask my husband when he gets back. Thank you, thank you so much. Of course, we'll keep an eye out for him. I'm sure he'll come back eventually. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Have a good night, Sweetie. Bye bye. How'd that go? How'd it go, how'd it go? Relax, babe, some old lady just lost her cat. And he was just the cutest little thing. Little white mittens and little black face. Did she see any blood, did she suspect anything? You have blood on your collar. I wrapped up. No blood on my hands. Nothing up my sleeve. Babe, calm down, she was just looking for her cat, ok? Cat's long gone. Why don't I take over from here. You can hold the camera and I will finish this up, ok? Yeah? Ok. Shit babe, you know we should probably do something about finger prints, eh? Teeth, we gotta do the teeth. Can you go back to the freezer and get the bag with his head in it and some pliers please. Yeah, sure. Thank you. Nice pearlies, Gary. Fuck, Jesus. I think there's a reason why dentists make more money than butchers. Ok. There we go. Watch your head. I guess we can tell who cleans in this house, yeah? Don't use paper towels, your wasting trees. It's not coming off with the sponge. Of course it's coming off. No, I have to absorb it. Well babe, why don't we just do a first pass at it and we'll get down to the finer details later. The sponge is just moving it though. If I use the paper towel, I'll absorb it. If you use the green side of the sponge, it smears it around. If you use the yellow side of the sponge. I used both, I just did it. It's like a wine stain, just sop of the worst of it and then we'll use the products to clean it up after. Can you just let me do it the way that I'm doing it? Ok. There you go, that's using your head. Babe, make sure you get the outer sides too. And there's a whole bunch along the outside. I'm getting there, I'm starting here. And there's shit all over the floor. Can you shut the fuck up? Can you shut up? Ok. Well, you know, babe, if we ever needed an excuse to redo the floors and the bathtub, I would say this is a decent one. Oh gross, I think I found a piece of something anyway. You know, I think, I think that went really well, right? Don't you? It's not done yet, so. No, I'm feeling good. I'm good about this. We're good. We got it done. It's not done. Well, almost. It's just like the last little bit. Come on, Babe, we should be proud of ourselves. We're not out of the woods yet. No, we're going into the woods. Can you help me? Put the camera down. All right, ok, ok, sorry. Ok? Yep, yep. Take it from the bottom. Watch the shovel. You're doing such a good job, Babe. Look how fucking strong you are. Keep an eye out for poison ivy, I'm pretty sure it's bad in there. Fuck. Close it. Attract some fucking dogs or something. Can you shine the light right here? Yep, yep. Good job, Babe. You're doing great. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Are you ok? What happened, what happened? What's wrong? What's wrong? Nothing can you fucking help me? Put the camera down and help me. Babe, I'm documenting the process. This is going to take all night if you're just fucking filming the whole thing. Can you just put the fucking camera down so we can dig a fucking hole? This is fucking going to take all fucking night. Ok, jeez, ok, no, Babe, can get a little bit more of you digging, like a little bit more of you digging? No, no you can't. No you fucking can't. Turn of the fucking camera. We need to dig this fucking hole. I'm going to blow my fucking shoulder out. Stop yelling at me, ok? I'm not fucking yelling. Put the fucking camera down, turn it off. Is it off? Turn it off. Ok, turning it off, I'm turning it off. I'm turning it off, I'm putting it down. Just calm down, relax. Is it off? Yes, it's off, it's down, relax, ok? I want to put it somewhere, I don't want to kick it or lose it in the dark. It fucking stinks, god damn it. Yeah, jeez, Gary, you're a smelly, man. Come on, I'm helping. Can you grab the shovel? This isn't that hard. All fresh and clean? Huh? Farhang? Farhang? Do you really need to be filming right now? Well, yeah, there's a couple of little things to get. We have to burn the clothes and I'm probably going to do another run of the bathroom. Probably pick up some more bleach at the store. I'm too fucking tired to do that. We did it. Cheers, Gary. You like the pork, Gary, yeah? This is some great pork, you know. It tastes squishy, but not gross squishy on the inside. You know? You like wine, Gary? Good wine, yeah? Yeah? Yeah, this is the best wine I've ever had. I think I'd like to make a cheers to you guys. You know, you take me into your house and you treat me like family. You know, Farhang, why aren't you eating your dinner here? Poor bastard. Hello, Babe. Hey. How are we? Not bad. Good, good day? I got lots done today. Yeah? Don't you want to hear what I did? Go ahead. I did another once over of the bathroom and it is spotless and I checked the basement for hair and blood traces and I burned the clothes and I made a necklace out of Gary's teeth. Oh, there he is. I've done more cleaning in the basement than I have since we moved in here. Ok. You didn't grab a beer for me? I'm joking, I'm joking. What're you doing? What do you mean what am I doing? What do you mean? I thought this was over. We did everything. Yeah, doesn't mean we can't play with it and use it. Yeah, but this is over. This whole thing. Babe. Hey, careful. Why don't you understand that I don't want to see it right now? You can't piece together why I'm uncomfortable with it? I want to get the after effect. Put the camera away. Farhang. Please put the camera away. Promise me that it's over. Ok, I promise. I promise. And we can go back to normal. Ok, we'll go back to normal. There you are, you fucking little rat. Come on out. Really, Buddy? Hey. Hey. How's it going, Babe? Not bad. Do you need something? Why the fuck do you have that? What do you mean? Don't give me that. Why do you have the camera in your hand. Were you outside with the camera right now? Yeah. Why? Why do you need the camera outside for a walk? Weren't you just saying we were done with this? Why are you pointing the fucking camera at me? Ok, fine. You just said we were done fucking filming. Farhang, careful, you're going to break it. Stop. You just said we were fucking done. Listen to me. We went through every fucking step of your disgusting plan. We did every fucking thing that you asked me to. And I asked you for one thing. You fine? You feel really proud of what you did the other day? Tell me what you did. What we did? What we did, Farhang? Yeah, what you made me do and I fucking followed through. You feel good about what you did? I feel fine. To that innocent fucking homeless, did nothing wrong in his fucking life guy. I didn't want to kill Gary. He was not my first choice. So it's my fucking fault? Don't you put that fucking shit on me. Don't you fucking put that shit on me. I wanted to kill somebody who wasn't innocent. Gary was a nice guy and I liked him, I didn't want to kill him. Yes, he didn't deserve to die. There was an asshole out there. But you fucking decided that we have to commit murder now. There was an asshole out there who deserved to die but you wouldn't let me. No, he fucking doesn't either. Babe, please. We're done. Please, just come here. We're done, stop it. We're done. Promise me. Tell me we're done. We're done, ok. God. How the fuck am I suppose to have a life with you? I can't fucking trust anything that you say. The one thing I fucking asked you for, you couldn't do. Fine. Ok, the camera, it's gone, you have it. It's done. Ok, it's done. Promise me. I promise, just put it away. You want it gone, it's gone. Your words fucking mean nothing to me. Hey. Hey. You ok? I'm trying to be. Sorry I got completely carried away. I'll try and do better ok? I just want everything to go back to normal. No more filming. No more cameras, no more craziness. Things will get better. I love you. I'm sorry. What was that? What was what? What're you looking at? I'm not looking at anything. Come here. Farhang. Come here and kiss me. What were you looking at? Stop, come on. Come here and take me. Stop, stop, stop. Please stop. Are you filming me while you're telling me that you're not going to film me anymore? Farhang. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Are you fucking kidding me? Please, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You're fucking lying to me. You just said that you're not filming and you said no more filming and you're fucking filming me right now? I just wanted to film something fun. What did you want to film, huh? What did you want to film? Remember what you first wanted to film? Right? Right? Are you going to stop fucking lying to me? Farhan, no. Jennifer. You know, one of the things that's interesting? It's the oldest friends that in most cases last the longest. Oh, you got another one. Thank you. that's it Jennifer, you just carry it in there. That's it, kid. Move it. That's right, light up the cigarette. Jennifer. Yes. Good job. Hello. 1983. Good thing my mom didn't throw out this camera. And hopefully Farhang won't break you. To make up for the loss of my old toy, I've got a new one. This is going to be so much fun. Yo. Testing, one, two, three. We're here to give Mr. Rich man and his girlfriend a bit of a surprise. A shock, if you will. But you're going to wait here and watch from a distance. So don't blink. Hi. Hi. I'm sorry to bother you, but I lost my cat a little while back and I'm just in the area and I wasn't sure if anybody maybe had seen him or picked him up. Who's at the door? No I haven't. It's just someone here. No, he's really sweet and small and he's black and white. I haven't seen him. No. No, I'm sorry. Jeez, I'm sorry to bother you, has anybody in the house maybe seen him? Did you see a cat, hun? What's all the noise over there? Who the fuck are you? Remember me? Do I know you? Who's the cunt now? Beautiful. Jeez, how long are you guys going to be out? Wake up. Hey, wake up. Hey, wake up. Wake up. Hello. Morning, sunshine. Richy, shut up. Yeah, me, remember me? Shut up, shut the fuck up. I will hit you in the head with this fucking hammer. I will cave your fucking head in. That's better. Shhh. Shh. Hey, hey, hey I brought you a present. Take a look around, you have company. Yeah. You picked a good one though, she looks fantastic. She is gorgeous. Look at that. Do you know what she looks like with a ball gag in her mouth? Trophy wife and a trophy girlfriend. Get your hair so we can see that pretty face. Got a little excited there. Sweetheart, there's a needle in your neck, and if you move around too much, I might push the plunger and I don't really know exactly what's going to happen with cleaning fluid in the human body. Has he told you he loves you, Sweetheart? Awww, that's so sweet. Do you love her more than you love your wife? Probably. Do you love her more than you love yourself? Cause I don't need to plunge both of you. Would you rather I take this needle out of her neck, stick you with it and let her walk away? Do you love her that much? Or would rather I let you go and I will stick her instead? Give me the go ahead and you can walk out of here. Give me a nod. I just want to know it's ok. You gonna save yourself? Yeah? Wow, that took a lot less effort than I fucking thought. Sorry, Sweetheart, you picked the wrong guy. Are you getting this? Shit. Is that upsetting? Hey, suit man. Hey. That's got to be pretty traumatizing for you. She died right on your back. And right on your word. Are you seriously fucking crying and drooling like a fucking baby? Given the circumstances, I don't think I'm the bitch in this room right now. I didn't even think you were capable of producing tears. You must have really liked her. Not nearly as much as you like yourself you piece of shit. You worthless piece of fucking shit. You did this yourself. You want to go home to your wife? Or you know, we could actually bring her into the party. Have the two of them ever met? Have those two ever met? Would you prefer me to use the hammer or the syringe on her? Hey, I'm home. Shh, shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Do you want to get out of here? Do you want to get out of here? Then not another god damn word. Or I will smash your fucking head in with this fucking hammer. Good boy. You sit tight, I will be right back. Hey, I'm home. Hey. Hey, Babe, I'm downstairs. Sweetie? Honey, I'm downstairs. Come on down, come on down. I have a surprise for you. Hey. What the fuck is that? It's a camera. You bought another camera? Come here, I have something to show you. You bought another fucking camera? Come here, come here, I'm going to show you. No seriously, I thought this was over. I smashed the first fucking camera and I'll break this one too. You're not going to touch this fucking... Did you fucking buy that camera? No. What the fuck is going on? We can fix it, Babe. What the fuck is wrong with her? What's wrong with her? She's dead, that's what's wrong with her. Oh my god. It's not like you don't know what this looks like. What the fuck are you doing? Do you remember the guy that I told you about that we were suppose to kill, not Gary? I got him. What the fuck are you doing? We killed Gary first. Get these fucking people out of my fucking hosue. Get these people out of my house. I can't fucking do this. I cannot do this. We have to do this right, Farhang. I just want to do this right and then it'll be like before. It'll be fine. No it won't. Yes, it will. No it won't. Get these fucking people out of our house. This is our house. This piece of shit deserves to die, Farhang. No he doesn't. Yes, he does. Who the fuck are you to decide that? This guy killed Gary. You killed Gary. No, we killed Gary. You fucking killed, Gary. We killed Gary. And it' the assholes fault. I did everything for you. No, that's not true. This would be doing everything. And then it'll be better. Get that out of my face, I did everything for you. It'll be better if you just do it. I can't, no, I can't fucking do this. Farhang, come back. Come here, please. I won't. I fucking did this for you. I did all of the fucking things that you fucking asked me to do for us. Please, we just need to do it right and it will go away. What're you going to fucking do for me? What? Because of this asshole, we had to kill Gary. Because of this piece of shit. Because of you we had to kill Gary. That was you. You're the fucking worst thing that's ever fucking happened in my life. Get that out of my fucking face. Get that out of my face. I will fucking call the police. You won't call the fucking police. Yes, I will, fucking try me. Listen to him, you can hear for yourself. Why don't you tell him what a piece of shit you are. I don't know what I did, I don't know. You don't fucking know, you lying piece of shit. Come on, untie me, let me go, man. He's not going to help you. Farhang, this piece of shit, that is cheating on his wife with that woman. Shut up, don't listen to her, she's a fucking crazy bitch.
