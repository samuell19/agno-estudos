[man] I'm not saying it'll be easy. [rock music playing] [engine revs] But I am saying it'll be worth it. Anything is possible if you try. People have to blame their problems on luck, destiny, karma... But you know what always drives someone to failure? "Ugh, I can't do it," "I quit..." They never say to themselves, "I'm gonna keep fighting for what I want." - [music intensifies] - [engine accelerates] Not fighting for what you want leads to one thing... failure. What do you know about failure? Your dad got you a job straight out of university. - Laura spent seven years trying to... - Whoa! Four to seven. - They've all said no. - Not all of them, no. This whole "where there's a will, there's a way" stuff is fine up to a point, but... We spend most of our adult lives working. The only way to be truly happy is if we do what we love. You don't think that's important, huh? Living out your dream. Yeah... yeah, but I think... - I think we need more beer. - More than anything. Hang on there, Mr. Wonderful. Are you saying your dream is to write trash for the Internet? Pardon me, sir, but I am an investigative journalist who uses reliable sources. - [laughs] You're serious? - Could I get another one? Your last article was "Anxiety, Stress and Other Imaginary Friends." People love that kind of shit. What about "My Mothers Are Lesbians and It Turns Me On"? Totally real! Seville guy. Funny but tragic. "Sleep With Any Woman by Saying You Went to School Together"? That has a 100% success rate. Yeah, I'm sure. Go on. Any girl at the bar. Make it a bet. - Bet you a beer. - Deal!

Oh, were you gonna hit on her? No. I mean, yes, but not because I wanted to. Just... [sighs] Look, I'll be honest. I made a bet with my friends. Stupid... - I bet I could sleep with her. - [woman laughs] It's funny because I bet my friends that I could sleep with you! [both laugh] - Those girls. - I see. - [woman] Hey! - [man] Uh... But anyway, I'm gonna need your help. I really don't wanna pay for those damn drinks. - Besides, my plan for you is foolproof. - Oh yeah, what's that? - I have a look. - Mmm. Watch. First, I lower my chin. Then I part my lips. Then I look up just a little, like we're in a dream. And then... [eerie note plays over music] Boo! [laughs softly] So how about those drinks? [both chuckling] Perfect! Oh, sorry. - Hey! - [barman] Give me a second. [sighs impatiently] So, I'm in a rush, and I'm done with this place. And I need something else, okay? I'm gone. Excuse me. Okay... - What are you waiting for? Come on. - So we can't we just stay here? Pff! No, big no. Listen. Tonight I really need someone... Someone to have an amazing night with, fuck and never see again. [chuckles] What always ruins a perfect night? The next day. See, if you call, you're annoying. If you don't, you're a piece of shit. Then you have to meet the family, the friends and pretend you like them. I really hate meeting the family. Everyone does! Getting to know each other screws everything up. Let's just have a great night and never get to the bad stuff. A perfect time together that will never be ruined. [dance music playing] I have an early start tomorrow, so I need to know. - Uh, shit. [laughs nervously] - Am I scaring you? Scared? I don't know the meaning of the word. Great! See you outside. [laughs nervously] [dance music intensifies] Uh, what about your friends? [indistinct chattering] Them? Never seen them before in my life. Give me a second. - Run. - Why? Because I just stole this helmet. Go!

Yes, I just need... Never mind. Thank you! [gasps] Wedding reception. A wedding? Seriously? It has everything you would want for a perfect night. Just as long as you're not the bride. And didn't you want a drink? Open bar! Just follow my lead. [breathing heavily] No! No, no, no, no, no. My cousin's gonna kill me. We can go in, right? - Yes, if you tell me your name. - Oh no! She's gonna be so upset. Growing up she said she'd die if I didn't come to her wedding. I... I really don't want her to die. Mohapi and guest. Right there. Mohapi? - Mohapi. - And guest. Yeah, but the dress code is formal attire. Don't you hate it when they make you dress up to fit in? I mean, I think I look pretty good, no? I do, right? Oh, mama! [funk music playing] This is wicked! What are we doing here? [laughs] What people do at weddings! Eat! And drink. Hey! [chuckles] How's it going? It's been way too long. You look so pretty. So pretty. Hi! Hi, how are you?

To you. - Cheers! - [guests cheering, applauding] What kind of shit speech was that? My cousin deserves better, you know? - Okay. - [glass clinking] Hello. Sorry. Hi. How's it going? [chuckles] Okay. I am sorry, but no... I couldn't just sit there I just have to say that I'm so proud of both of you.

What... what do you mean "everything happened"? I saw you the other day. You were with a nurse. You smiled at me. I would've been heavily sedated if I was with a nurse. I wouldn't remember anything. So you weren't happy to see me? Uh, obviously not. No. [scoffs] - What the hell is wrong with you? - Uh... nothing. I wanted to see you and get your number. You're a complete lunatic. Well, everyone in this place is a lunatic. [sighs] Great! Why are you here? You seem fine to me! You just... Mmm! You actually think you know me because we slept together? Come on!

Come on. - [Saúl] You can't get out that way. - [male nurse] Rosa! There's no handles, just like the windows in banks. You're gonna have to go all the way upstairs if you wanna get out of here.

But Adrián, you're the one who asked to be admitted. I've changed my mind. When you signed this form, you signed over your guardianship. - What? - We decide when you can be released. By the way, your signature is very interesting. Signatures reveal a lot. Maybe one day I'll explain the significance of these lines... I made it all up, okay? It's all a lie. [both laughing] The new ones always try it once, don't they? - Remember the one last... - That's enough. No, I'm telling the truth. This is all a mistake. I need to get out. Look, Adrián, if you want to leave, you can leave. - I can? - Of course! Once we've seen behavioral improvements and that you're getting along nicely with everyone. See, here the patients evaluate each other. It's a, mmm, system I may have come up with myself. - Brilliant, right? - For sure. Excuse me! I'm a journalist. I came here to write an article. Mmm? Okay? You call my editor at work and confirm it. [sighs] [phone rings] - This is Load. - [director] Hi. Good afternoon. I'm calling from the psychiatric residence Los Sauces. We have a patient here, Adrián Mallo. He's a marvelous young man, but he insists that he's a journalist at your magazine. Do you know him? Adrián? Adrián, Adrián Mallo. Mmm. No, no. No idea. No idea? - Ah! Ana, it's me, Adri! - Hey! Hey! [Adri] Ana, it's not funny! - So you don't know him? - Sorry, no. My mistake. Sorry. Ciao. [Adri] Ana! Please! Ana! [muffled growling] Hey, what's the matter? [sighs] I know that you think we're all deranged and that deranged people aren't all there, but we're actually pretty good at listening, so tell me what's going on. - Gotta get out of here. - Well, it's not a prison. Eventually, you'll be released, and then you can go home. I need to leave now. You wanna leave now? See? There's no lock. A gift left for us by the Grasshopper. [grunts] Only thing is it's a free fall from three floors up. To this day, the only person to have done it is Pablo the Grasshopper. He's a legend here. A legend! And did Pablo die? Well, he... he broke... he broke both of his legs. But he dragged himself home bit by bit. He was perfect. Legendary. I'm gonna do it. I'll land on the trash, hopefully. [spluttering] Just... I think the garbage is a great idea, but it's just that the Grasshopper, he also landed in the garbage. He thought it would work too, but then he broke both legs. So, you might wanna think strategically. Maybe you want to... I got it. Okay. I got this. - I'll help you. - [yelps] What are you doing?

[breathing heavily] - I can use the phone, right? - But who are you gonna call? - I see, mmm, Dr. Ramírez? - Mm-hmm. [director] You're here to take Adrián Mallo? As his personal psychologist, I believe Adrián would be better off in a private atmosphere. - Yeah. - Yes. - A psychologist? - Mm-hmm. Well, just graduated. - Got some fresh ideas. - [both laugh] And why are you wearing a stethoscope? Well, it's so nobody has to ask, "Is there a doctor in the house?" [chuckles] They just know. [both laugh] [director] Just fascinating. Remind me. Where did you study? - At the Autónoma. - Seriously? - Yes. - I did too! - Yes? - So you worked with Dr. Pedro Pascual. - Of course, Pedrito. For sure. - [laughs] I'm just in love with his paper on the efficacy and progress of empirical treatments. What do you think? Oh, me too. It's like I always say, "If it's not empirical, it's not for me." [laughs nervously] Those aren't prescription glasses. No. Mmm. Well, then, I guess you'll show yourself out, right? Yep. Perfect. - [sighs] - Laura! Hey, hey! - What did you do? - Don't know what happened. She caught me. I don't know. I'm sorry. I've gotta perfect my Dr. Ramírez. No, you think? Oh, shit! This is not my fault! I warned you this would happen! They won't let me leave, Laura. I am a prisoner. Maybe just calm down? I won't calm down! This nightmare can't get any worse. It's about to. Andrés called. If you don't send in the article today, you're fired. Shit! The article! What am I gonna do? - You could try writing it? - That's a good idea. Got a pen, paper? No, uh, now? - Yeah, now. - No. - I have an audition, Adri. - Your cell phone! - Make it fast! - [Adri] Ready? - [Laura] Hold on. - [Adri] Mmm. [exhales] Go! Where do all of society's outcasts end up? - Really? - The answer may surprise you. [Laura exhales] - [sighs] - Lunacy, lunacy. Look it up for me. - What? - Lunacy, lunacy.

All right, the first thing you'll have to do, the very first thing is participate in all the activities around here, you hear me? All of them. So I want you to take this and come with me to an event. Tonight. We're gonna go together. Tonight. This conversation never happened. [whispers] Where are you taking me? They're gonna go after you with everything they've got, you hear me? But you, Adri, do not let them smell your fear. You must be like a coffin or a dead tree or a sealed tomb. [woman] Okay, huh. [Carla] I've got you right where I want you, you bitch. [blues harmonica playing] - Hah! I'm gonna double your bet. Four. - [Victor laughs] - [Carla] Four. - [Victor] Risky move. - [radio static] - [blues harmonica continues] [woman] How about you make it easier on yourself and give me the pills now. Forget about the poker. I don't know if an ex-gambler should even be playing. Ex-gambler, whatever you say! [laughing] - [Carla] What have you got? - Flush. - Fuck it! - [Carla] Oh boy. So sorry, Tina, but say goodbye to your pills! - Damn it! - [all laugh] Poker. I'll take your citalopram, fluoxetine, and those blunts. I wish I would've brought condoms. I know you could use them. - [all laugh loudly] - Shh! Shh! [whispering] Carla, keep it down. You're all being very, very noisy. What the fuck is he doing here? - If you want, I can go. - Great, thank you. It's just... I thought these might interest you. [whistles] You think you can bribe us with some pills? - We might be crazy, but do we look stupid? - Some more than others. Is that diazepam? You got some Rivotril? You're in. Pull up a chair. - Good evening. - Good evening. Hey, what's up? Do I know you? Don't worry about Sergio. - He doesn't even know himself. - [laughs] You could spend an entire century talking to him, and after five minutes, he'll have forgotten all about it. Is that true? Impossible. That's the first time I've heard it. [Carla laughs] Hey, Adri, want to tell us about your debut? - My what? - [Saúl] Debut. That's what we call the first time... [sighs] ...you feel like a stranger in your mind. Ah, no, no, never had that. - [exhales] - Hey, me neither. As far as I remember. [all laugh] - Hey! I'm serious! - [Carla] We know, honey. - Of course you are. Don't worry. - Mmm. Ah. Don't you all wanna leave? Hell yeah! I'm counting down the days until I get out of this fucking place. Why are you here, Tina? Oh, I lost my head at work. It was a total meltdown. - Mm-hmm. What kind of work? - I'm a princess. [laughs] Is this asshole laughing at me? - These commoners. - Are you serious? I'm gonna take my cards and leave. I don't need all this. - Okay. A princess, I got it. - [Marta whistles] The king and the queen, those are my fucking parents. - Come on, Tina, I can see your cards. - Oh, shit! Look, I... I only meant that maybe we should be working together to get out sooner. Perhaps give each other good marks so we can get out? I live in a palace. Yes, but every single one of us is in this place because we really need it. - You all look good to me. - You have no idea why we're here, Adri. [sighs] Wait for me. I have to go to the bathroom. - Come on! Ugh. - Seriously! Can we play some poker? Try not to wash your hands 847,000 times. Okay, let him wash his hands as many times as he... he wants. Okay. [laughing] - You're so ridiculous. - [Marta laughs] And you, Marta? Don't you want to get out of here? Yeah, of course. What she actually wants is to get her hands on Victor. Víctor? Isn't he a little bit, uh, neurotic? Don't call him that, please. [whistles] So, how's that going? Any progress? Any progress. All she can do is tell him about her pussy! - Your parents love to eat my pussy. - Hey, hey. - Long live the Republic, you bitch. - You can't fake your tics with me, eh? - Keep your voices down. - Why don't you just tell him how you feel? - Hmm? - [Adri] You know? "Hey, Víctor, I like you." Ask him to get a coffee or something. No, no, can't. No, no. Mmm, mmm. Ah! No. - If there's a will, there's a way. - [scoffs] Did you get that shit off a mug? Hey, can we just shut up and keep going with the game? [whistles] Ah! No. I have a better idea. - If I help Marta get a date with Víctor... - Excuse me? ...will you all give me good marks at the next meeting? I can't tell if you're nuts or just an asshole? - O... okay. - If you fail, will you shut the fuck up? If I do fail, you get all my pills. You're on. I haven't accepted yet. - [Tina] Oh, he's back. - I'm back. Did I miss anything? No, no, no. Not much. - No! Come on, don't screw me over! - [Tina] Marta! Marta! Tomorrow at 11:00, Marta. [door opens] [door shuts] - [uplifting music playing] - [indistinct chattering] Eat my pussy. [whistles] [whispering] You'll find that helping Marta is impossible. [laughs] No way. Anything is possible if you try. What's up with your hair? I also smell amazing. Smell. Go on. [sniffs] Hmm. Marta may be a lost cause, but you can help me with something. Besides, you owe me a favor. I thought you said it felt good to help somebody, no? No. I offer the opportunity for you to give something back to me. [clears throat] I see. So, what can I do? Something that's practically legal. My old roommate used to help me out, but he's gone now. Was he released? I can neither confirm nor deny that. [whispering] Take this. Take it. Now, follow me. Follow me. - [whispering] What am I supposed to do? - Follow me. Come here. Put this on. Put it on. Then... [grunts] Just do as I do. Follow my lead, okay? [clears throat] [formally] So, Doctor, are you absolutely certain this is your diagnosis? Really very interesting. - What are you doing? - Papa! [sighs] Hey! My girl! Oh, it's so good to see you. Ooh! Daddy's working right now. Today I'm working with Dr. Mole. - You wanna say hi to Dr. Mole? - Hi. - Hello. - Good job. Daddy will be done really soon, okay? [kisses] So... [inhales] ...it would seem you and I have the same diagnosis, Doctor. The flu, yep! I prescribe a course of aspirin every eight hours. - And a few doses of jelly? - Strawberry! Of course! Strawberry, Doctor. Very important. Strawberry. The patient must not be disappointed. A berry good plan! Please, see to it. Hey! - Hi. - Thank you, both. Thank you so much for coming. We, uh... we have to leave in, uh, ten minutes. Ten minutes? That's nothing, ten minutes. We have things to do, don't we, dear? Of course, that's... [sighs, clears throat] - Right. I'll see you. Bye, Saúl. - Sorry, Saúl. [softly] Ten minutes? Just ten minutes? Hey! - Go. - [Saúl] Hey! That's ten whole super minutes, Sara! We're gonna have to use every single one. Yes, we will. Yes, we will. Yes, we will! Hey! Thank you so, so much! Thank you, Auri. Oh, Sara, I was thinking. Maybe we could pick up that game of pool we started last time, huh? - What do you think? - [Sara] Yeah! Let's go! [man] The delivery guy had to use a truck to bring all the shit you bought with the credit card. With my credit card. [Carla] I already said I was sorry. Please, I'm sorry! Why did you... How could you buy a motorcycle with my card? The doctor told us she was going through an episode. I'm sorry, Papa. You don't deserve a crazy daughter, a problem, like me. Please don't say that. You'll get better soon. No, Mom, no. I'm not gonna get better. Get it? Maybe you should try a little bit harder. Like when I feel sad or upset, I watch a funny movie... Stop it! Sorry. I'm sorry. Thank you for coming. - What, you're kicking us out? - [Carla] No. You can stay. Go out, enjoy the beautiful scenery without me. I just... I just need to be by myself for a minute or two. No, no, no. We're not leaving yet. - But I'm... - [knocking at door] I'm sorry, but visiting hours are over. - There are no time limits on visiting. - No, but, um... Carla must take her medicine. - Her Propalodontknowitine. - Fine, then. Fine. But, Doctor, wait a minute. I... What was the name of the drug? I've never heard of it. We should really be getting going, Carla. The other doctors are waiting. You're not getting a thank-you. You're still an asshole. Pleasure was all mine. You're just trying to get a good grade, aren't you? Yeah. Why else would I help you? It's for you. - [Auri] Bye! - [Sara] Bye-bye. - [Auri] Could you let us out? - [door buzzes] Yo! That was great! [sighs deeply] Why do people always say these things? You know what I mean? "Saúl, you're crazy. Saúl, you can't be a father" What does that mean, Adri? Do you have children? No. So, why the lab coats? Well, it´s because the lab coats are for people who aren't sick And my ex's husband seems to think that I... [inhales] That my little girl shouldn't find out. - [nurse] I'll take the lab coat now, Saúl. - Could you hold this? It's pretty good. Why are you so pleased? No... no reason. Are you so happy because you think that, by helping Marta, you'll get out soon? Uh-uh. Sure. It's not the final version, but at least it's somewhere we can start. "Víctor, I need to ask you a very important question. Is your name Google? Because you have everything I'm searching for." Do you want me to look like an idiot? Humor. It never fails. Trust me. [blowing raspberry] Víctor, I need to ask you m... - Melon! - Again. Víctor, I need to ask you a very important question. Is your name... - Lesbian! - No. Try again. Víctor, I need to ask you a very important question. Is your name Google? Because you have everything I'm searching for. - Okay, you feel good? - [Marta] Whoo! - Yeah, sure. - [Adri] Come on. Again. Víctor, I need to ask you a very important question. - Is your name... [whistles] - Again. Víctor, I need to ask you a very important question. - Is your name Google... - Again. - Víctor, I need to ask you... Ooh, ooh, ah! - You a question! - Breathe. - [both breathing deeply] [both vocalizing] Ah... [Adri] That's right! Look at me. Look at me. Hey, can we take a break, please? [ball thuds] - [Adri] Sure. - [exhales] [sighs] Hey... People with your syndrome can lead a normal life. Yeah. And so? I mean, nobody goes into a psychiatric center because of Tourette's. Then why are you here? Because it's not easy... [sniffs] ...having a normal life when everyone is always laughing at you and judging you for your tics. Bitch! I mean, I spent three months unable to get out of bed. I was afraid to go out... outside. I was diagnosed with depression. Can we continue? - [thunder rumbling] - [ball thuds] [indistinct chattering] There he is. Go for it. - Rainy weather. It's just bad luck, right? - Even better! - What do you mean, "better"? - Haven't you ever seen The Notebook? [Marta] I hate romantic comedies. - It's not a comedy. - Huh? Bitch! Oh well, anyway. Remember what I said? Believe that you can fly... I will never repeat that. You know it's dumb. ...and your feet will float off the ground. - I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. - [door opens] Where do you get this shit? - [door shuts] - Hey... [gentle music playing] [rain pouring] [Adri] Come on. Come on, Marta. That's right, Marta. Tell them to get lost. Could you guys give us a... a second? - Nothing personal. - [all] Okay. - [patient] See you later, Marta. - [whistles] Ah! [Adri] Good, good. Let's all go. Give them a little bit of privacy, people. You've got this, Marta. Víc... Víctor, I need to ask you a very important question, okay? - Fine. - Is your na... name Google? [chuckles] No. What? [whispering] Yeah, that's it. She's got this. I don't... I don't understand. I need to ask you a really important question, and I need you to answer me. Tell me, is your name A... Azalea? Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Bitch. - I'm sorry. - No, no, it's fine. It's okay. - I'm gonna go. - But... but I thought you had a question. No, no. No, no, no, no, no! What... what's happening? What are you doing? Marta, get back out there, okay? - [door slams] - Marta, come on! Marta, listen to me! - Marta, hang on. - [Adri] Go back. Marta. Marta, hang on a second. Why don't you just tell him? No tricks, no pretending. Don't just do... Look at me. Don't just do what the whole fucking world expects you to do. And if he does likes you, you know what? He better like you as you are. [whistles] Yeah? [chuckling] [Adri chuckles] [whistles] - A little crazy? - [Carla] A little crazy. - [laughs] - [Marta] All right, I'm going. [door opens, shuts] Come on, Marta. Let's go. You can do it. I can't believe how hooked I am on this weird soap opera. - That's because you're as corny as he is. - What the hell was that, little princess? Ví... Víctor, I really like you. [exclaims, sighs] I said it. Well, I... [chuckles] I... I don't understand. What I mean is... I like you. - Yeah, yeah. - I like you. Yeah, I think I understand. Please, please, please. Say yes. Okay. So, like... I... I... Also maybe... Mmm... Fuck! I've never done this before. I'm an idiot. No way. The only idiot standing here is me. - Look at me. - No. - You're not an idiot. - We're so bad at this. [both laughing] - They're laughing! - Looking good. Come on, Marta. - Come on. - This is it! - [Tina] Yeah, I see them. - [Carla gasps] I'd like to kiss you now. Don't worry, hey? My... my teeth are really clean. [giggles] Brushed twice. [giggles] [chuckles] Twice? Come on, Marta, you can do this. Yeah. My clothes are clean too. Fresh out of the laundry on a two-hour cycle. Wow! That's the one I use too. [snorts] Awesome! I think I may... may need a little help. Yeah! Yes, yes, yes! - [all gasp] - [Adri] Fuck yeah! [both laugh shyly] - She did it! - What did I say? Here's to love! Here's to... If we give him good marks at the next meeting, we can get rid of him. - It actually worked. - Well, thanks to you. - We did it together. - Sure, fifty-fifty, right? Plans tonight? Tonight? Mmm... No plans. Why? I'll see you at 7:00. [chuckles] [joyful music playing] Hey! [laughing] [sniffs] [crying softly] Well, I did it! They love me. Told you it would work. - What's wrong, Saúl? - [sobbing] Hey, hey. Are you okay? [sobbing] My ex made me promise to stop seeing my daughter because... because it would be dangerous for her. I don't... I don't think it was her idea. Her husband, I bet he... - Whoa, whoa! Buddy, buddy! - I'm gonna go to his house. - I'm gonna get my girl back! - No, no, no! Don't say that! No, no, no, no, no! You don't fall apart now, got it? What you gotta do is... [sobs] ...think positive. I don't... [melancholy music playing] Do you mind if I... if I could just be alone in the... Can you leave me alone for a bit? I just wanna be alone for a while here. Could you go now, please? Yeah. Okay. Okay, Saúl. I'll go. I don't... I don't know what to do. [crying] I don't know what to do. It's his ex's husband. He can't see his daughter anymore. That fucking sucks. Saúl's a good man. He doesn't deserve that. What? Are you ever gonna tell me? Tell you what? Why you're really here. I'm bipolar. - Type 1. - Bipolar? Mm-hmm. And that's like when one day you're... you're sad, but then the next day you're all happy? Not exactly. That's more like rapid cycling. [both laugh] Mine change over a longer time. One period's depressive and the next euphoric. - So, when was your debut? - [exhales] Very good! Quick learner. [chuckles] At 13. Ran away from home. The police found me trying to get on a boat to get to a Pulp concert in England. - No way! - By myself. In euphoric episodes, you don't think about the consequences. And the next morning, you wake up in a war zone. You've set off a bomb, and everyone hates you. Like your dad. I always max out his credit card when I'm euphoric. [Adri] Hmm. And the depressive times? [gasps softly] You know how... some diseases can kill you? In this case, you find yourself wishing it would. Whee! [chuckles] Fun times. The night you met me, you were in euphoria, hmm? - Yeah, it was the start of a manic period. - Manic is... is euphoria? Yeah. I'm a manic-depressive. [laughs] That night was incredible. For me, anyway. Yeah. It was for me too. Adri, I... I'm not gonna let this go any further. - I don't get it. - Yeah, you do. You don't know what it's like being with someone who can't control their feelings. But aren't you learning to control them? That's why you're here. Oh, you're just like my mother. You don't know how this works. Okay, fine, maybe I don't, but I know you can do it. The human brain is fucking amazing. It's been proven that a willingness to recover is even more effective than medicine. Did you swallow a self-help book as a kid? [chuckling] I'm being serious, I swear. You're sure? I am sure. A hundred percent. We both know that you can do anything. And this guru's gonna help you. [both laugh] [sighs] Adri... - What? - I had a great night. But you and I still can't go any further. Go on. Finish this shit. [sighs deeply] Shit, shit, shit! Damn it, Saúl! [breathing heavily] [whispering] Okay, you can do this. It's just three floors. Just three floors. Three. Two. One. No fucking way! [breathing heavily] Carla, I need you. - Oh my God! Can you let it go already? - No, no, no! It's not that. - The night we met? - Uh-huh? How did you escape? - What? - It's Saúl. [snoring] [whispering] Okay, he's asleep. Let's move. [snoring continues] Come on. He can't have gotten too far. You have a key? - I had sex with a security guard. - [laughs] That's funny. - You're kidding, right? - Get in. [car door shuts] Who's remote? Neus. She works at the front gate. And how did you get it? Holy shit! Nobody's safe. - [chuckles] - It always gets stuck. Go open it. - Okay. - Oh! Don't slam the... Shh! Shh! Fucking amateur hour over here! - Shh! Quiet! - Ow! - What? - Why do I even bother? Oh damn, I love driving. [engine accelerating] Don't you think you could go a little bit slower? - Why? Are you scared? [laughs] - No. No, no. I promise. When I get out, the first thing I'm doing is getting my license. - Are you kidding? - No. [tires screech] - Carla, stop, stop, stop, stop! - [tires screeching] Oh my God! [sighs] [Carla laughs] [wailing desperately] [tires screeching] Saúl! Saúl, wait! Would you stop acting crazy! - Saúl! - [Adri] Saúl, stop. Saúl, listen to me. If you go after your daughter now, you'll never see her again. But if I get her, then she can stay with me. Don't argue with him. He can't see anything. He can't... - Saúl. Saúl, listen. - [mumbling] Please listen to me, Saúl. You need to calm down. Please, Saúl, for me. - You have to listen to me... - That's enough. Saúl, calm down. You have to... I get it Saúl. - [sobbing] She's my girl! - Your girl. Your little girl, I know. You need to explode. You need to scream. You need to burn the world down. But this isn't the way. You don't wanna wake up tomorrow morning and realize that you messed up so badly, you hurt someone you love. Right? But I just can't go back. - I gotta do something. I have to. - No. No, no. We're not taking you back. We won't stop you. We'll help you, okay? We'll do something... something that feels good but that won't get you thrown into prison, okay? Yeah? It's gonna have to satisfy me because I don't care if I go to prison. - It has to satisfy me. - I promise you. - Promise me, Carla. - [Carla] You bet. [Saúl] Thank you. - [whispering] What do we do? - I thought you knew. No idea. No. I may have an idea. - Right here? - [Saúl] Yes. I'll go see if they're sleeping. Shh. [exclaims quietly] They're asleep for now. Come on. Quick! Do it. Now. [grunts] That's it? We came here for that? Ah, Saúl. Don't you want to do this? Or this? [grunts] - Have some fun! - I am having fun. I just... [Carla screams] [grunts, gasps] Oh! Neat! - [Carla] How was that? - See? - How does it feel, Saúl? - Well, how does it feel for you? Fucking amazing! - [dogs barking] - Whoa. - Fuck this car up, Saúl. - I like that idea. - To hell with this fucking car. - [Carla screams] - [alarm wailing] - [panting] Whoa! - We gotta go. - I don't think he even has a car. Are you kidding? Hey, I'm a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic. You expect me to remember all these things? - Come on, Saúl! - [laughs] - Is that your excuse for everything? - Hey, but are you satisfied? Hey! Goddamn it, that's my car! - [Carla] Oh shit! - [Adri] Run, run! Go, go, go! What the fuck? [tires screeching] I'll kill you! Come back! I'll kill you! - [dogs barking] - [alarm wailing] [gentle music playing] [chuckles] Check it out. - [snoring] - [Carla] Sleeping like a baby. - That was fun. - [gate opening] It was. [chuckles] You're so full of it! But you know what? I'm happy you snuck into the hospital. I'm glad you're here. [Saúl snoring] Do you mind? Careful when you close... - [door slams] - [snorts, exhales] [exhales] Ridiculous. Amateurs.

I just need you to see what I see when I look out there past the mountains, huh? I need you to get it, Adri! I need you to understand... [yelps] Yeah, she'll be fine. Just a little bump. So, she needs to rest. [nurse] Of course. I understand. [both continue speaking indistinctly] She's been off her meds for days. Hey. Hi. What is this? Is that an IV? Tell me she doesn't know. I'm sorry, Carla. I had to. No. Who... who the hell do you think you are? - No! - Carla, I said I was... - You have no right to mess up my life. - No, no, no. Nurse, quick! I have to start over because of you. No! You told me, Adri. You said I could do it. You promised. [exhales] I don't want to see you anymore. I... [Carla groans softly] [whispers] Carla. [sniffles] What is it? Guys? - [whistles] - You tell us. [Marta] Ah. Your article just came... just came out this morning. - Oh fuck! - The outcasts of society, huh? - The girl from The Exorcist? - I can explain. - Before I really knew you... - You don't have to explain at all. I hope you had lots of fun with your experiment. - No! - Adri, fuck... fuck you! - And that wasn't my Tourette's. - [Adri] Wait. Wait. - [Marta] Let's find another table. - No. Saúl, I... THE TRASH OF SOCIETY [director] So... [exhales] ...you were telling the truth. Well, I'm feeling a bit stupid, honestly. I'm sorry. I'm giving you permission to leave here immediately. One more thing. Carla, it was all my fault. Adri, do you know why I have to be so strict letting people come and go? Well, I'm guessing to stop assholes like me? Well, in part. But also because most visitors, they want to help their loved ones and believe they know how. Look, I've got two degrees and three master's, and it might seem hard to believe, but in the majority of cases, I'm much more effective than those who try to fix someone with good intentions or love. They bring themselves here and believe they'll get better, but no. We help patients to live with themselves as they are, and that takes a long time. Right. We encourage them not to pretend to be better for the benefit of others. Adri, the toughest thing about being mentally ill is that others want you to pretend that you're not. I have to get back to work now. That was pretty impressive. [Saúl] I think it's a good idea. I really do. Sure. I'm sure about it. I just want you to be happy, to make sure this is right for you. Your husband? Your husband think this is a good idea? I don't care. - [sniffs] - I don't think this is bad for her, Saúl. Is it true that you don't feel well? [stifled crying] Mm-hmm. Can I have a Band-Aid? [Auri] Aw. Is that a... What a good idea. What a great idea! All better now. See? [Saúl] Adri! Come on. Come here. Sara, this is my very good friend. He's a spy, you know? So, are we still friends? Sure! Perhaps, uh... [chuckles] Perhaps I'm being paranoid... but I can't help but think that you played a part in all of this and helped me out. [sniffs] Paranoid, maybe, but you're a good man, Saúl. I can neither confirm nor deny that statement. [chuckles softly] - Is he crazy too? - [all laugh] - Sara! - That's right, honey. He's crazy too, but he doesn't know it. Thank you. Take care, eh? Hey, honey? May I have another Band-Aid, please? I think I need a double dose. [Adri] As you already know, I had gotten myself admitted into a mental health center. What you didn't know is that I did it to save a woman. I wanted to get her out, to get her as far away from those freaks and that place as I could. I didn't get it right away. Maybe because it's complicated or probably because I'm dumber than I thought. But that woman didn't need an idiot like me to save her like some modern-day Prince Charming. I want her to know, even though I understand we can't be together, I'm always going to be madly in love with her. As I'm sure you can guess, I'm definitely no expert, but I think I learned at least a bit from my time there. Thank you. [Adri] And, for whatever it's worth, I wanted to share that. [Saúl] "I want her to know, even though I understand that we can't be together, I am always going to be madly... madly in love with her." My God, I can't believe it. Carla! [exhales] What? Was anyone else even listening to that shit? You know it's not shit. [Saúl] He's a linguistic genius. It's a masterpiece! - Both grammatically and semantically! - Semantically. - Those epithets. Oh! - The epithets, yes! It's beautiful. Beautiful? I've never heard so much bullshit in my life! Where are you going? That asshole needs to hear a thing or two. Let's go. - Saúl, keep reading. - [sighs] Let me find my place. "For whatever it's worth, I wanted to share that." - "I wanted to try..." - [Carla] Hey! You're all coming too. - [whistling] - Are you crazy? You want us to break out? Yep. Here they teach us how we can manage ourselves. But at the same time, we need to be able to show them who we really are. The next time we're let out into the real world, we've gotta be prepared for whatever happens. - Brace yourselves. She's losing it. - She needs lithium. She's having another episode. First, we need lithium. Marta's right. Barrels of lithium. It's the only way. Lithium, okay. - We were thinking that maybe you need... - Shh! You better be in. You owe me one. - Are you flaring up just a little bit? - This much? - A flare-up? - [whistles] This isn't some episode I'm having This is so much bigger than anything I've ever done. What about you, Marta? What are you going to do when someone laughs at one of your tics? And you, Víctor, are you ready to face a world without your beloved soap? Tina, don't you think that it's time for the princess to meet with her people? To lead them and to show every single one of them that being sad sometimes is okay. Okay if you're a princess or a commoner or someone whose life is full of sadness. And Sergio... - You're good? - I'm perfect! Yeah! [laughs] [whispering] Okay. Come on, come on, come on. - [clapping] - Come on. You know, we need to get... [all muttering, gasping] - We're gonna need a distraction. - We should've done this yesterday. - What? - Fuck, I have depression stress. - This is not good for me. - What kind of bird is that? Can everyone focus for one second so we can get out of here? - I have an idea. - What? - I'm on it! - Where's he going? Where are you going? Fucker! - [Víctor] Remember me! - You know I will. Bitch! Seriously? I'm starting to panic! - [hyperventilating] - Think calming thoughts. We're all gonna die but not today. Now breathe. - I'm looking for my soap. - You're not allowed to be here. - [Víctor] I need my soap. - Now! [director] No, Víctor, I've told you this many times... - [Tina groans] - [Víctor] I don't ask for much... [director] Listen to me, Víctor, it's not good for your condition. - [Víctor] I'm not wasting it... - Ah... Azalea! Ah! Hippie! - Oh shit. - What are they doing? - [Marta] Motherf... - Get away from there! - We just need it for a minute! - Hey! - Come on, Carla! - No! Wait! Be careful! Carla is on a mission! - Hey! Turn around! - It's very important! - Víctor, I think I love you a bit. - I love you a bit too, honey! - This is insane! - [Saúl] Be back soon! - Get the police on the phone, now! - No, no, no. no! Let me drive. - Go left. - Stop pointing right with your head, then. Come on, quick! Stay with them! [Andrés] One million clicks in two days. Our best ever article, and it's all thank to you, maestro. A million clicks in two days? Give me a kiss. Give me a damn kiss. Come on! [kisses loudly] Hey! Let's not go crying to HR! - [laughs] - Everyone's just such a snowflake. - [director] Saúl, stop! - Saúl! - Hello! - [director] Stop the van! - Come down. - No, don't! Don't move, you'll kill yourself. Be back for dinner! No, no, no! Watch out! - [motorcycle honking] - [both scream] - My God! - I saw my whole life flash before my eyes. [Andrés] Okay, people, here's what we're gonna do. We need to focus on the really trendy topics, shit the average idiot is dying to read about, like feminism and all that garbage. Everybody, let's put some ideas on the board. Hey! Hey, buddy! - [honks] - [Carla] Move it, asshole! - Can I cut them off now? - No, no, no! No passing. Follow them. Follow them while keeping us alive, okay? Fuck, man, learn to drive! [Marta] Look out for the car! The fucking car! I'm gay! - You're gay? - Who are you? What was I saying? I forget. - Can I cut them off now? - Sure, cut them off. Let me signal, accelerate... Okay, feminism. What else? How about LGBTQ equality? - Huh? - The community? LGBTQ? Homos. Great. - So, we lost them. - Rosa, please! - What? We did. - [director] They're still in front of us. - Without my glasses, I can't see shit. - What? You wear glasses? Ever since I was 13, but I don't like to wear them. The things make me look old. Rosa, get you goddamn glasses! What else? Uh... - Recycling, planet stuff... - Ecology? - Um... - [Ana] Pollution. - A buzz word. - [Ana] Climate change. - Climate change. - Climate change. - Greta Thunberg. - Huh? - [Ana] Greta Thunberg. - No, no. Climate change. Nothing weird. You know how they make you have five different bins in your kitchen now? Tell me. Any of you really do it? Ah, thanks. Wait, these are my sunglasses. - Not these. - [toy squeaks] Black people, Muslims... - Immigration? - Well, if we must. - [woman giggles] - [Andrés] Okay. Gotcha. Yeah, these glasses. I'll pop them on. There! That is them! - Take that and some of these! - Saúl, what the hell? - Is that toilet paper? You serious? - What the hell do you think you're doing? - This is going into the book! - No! Give me the book! [Saúl laughing] Adri, that stuff you were into... The stigmatization of mental illness. Ah right! Crazies! - Get back! Get back! - No, no, no! - No, no, no! - [all] Whoo! Topic. - My topic? - [Andrés] That's right. What's my topic? Oh, come on, you know. This guy with this guy and that girl and even with a bookshelf. You call that... Nymphomania? Nymphomaniacs. Plural. No, but... but it's not... Nymphomaniacs. Not just one anymore. Nothing's black or white today, you know? That's just, uh... That's diversity, yeah. - [Saúl] There you go! - [Rosa] Saúl! - Stop. - Saúl, please don't do that. Sleep time! Sleep time! - Time to go to sleep! - [both scream] - [gasp] - Yeah! - Whoo! - [all cheer] Stop! Stop, stop, stop! [tires screeching] [all cheer] - My, that was a... - I think I'm gonna throw up. Don't throw up in here, please. - That's better. - Get some fresh air. Ladies, ladies, ladies. Tina and I are not comfortable at all back there. You're driving very erratically. Okay. Quique, you're... You know... - [Quique] Uh... - [snorts] You know... [coughs] [snorting] Dru... drugs? Exactly. - Prevention? - [Andrés] No, no, not prevention. - Drugs. - [Quique] Drugs. Drugs. I bet that you could write about it by heart. Okay. [woman] Good afternoon? Excuse me. Where are you going? Hello. Good afternoon. We're here to... to see, uh, Adrián Mallo. - Do you have an appointment? - [Carla] No. No, but Adrián said we could always stop by, see him anytime. Well, he's in a meeting right now, so no, it won't be possible. - Of course it is. She's here with me. - You are? Are you kidding me? - Uh, sorry. - [Tina] Oh, come on. I'm sorry. There must've been a misunderstanding. I'm royalty, you hear me? If you don't let us through, your boss is gonna be very mad at you. She's, uh, royalty? We're in. The future queen of Spain is too. I repeat, going in. - [Marta] Bitch. - Okay, everyone out! Let's go! - Hey! Hey! - Oh! You keep your hands off me! I'm nuts. - This is crazy. - [Carla] Adri! Pedophilia is now, uh... Well, I'll put it in the maybe column. What else? - [Carla] Adri! - [Saúl] Adri! [Tina] Adri! Hey! - Adri! - Adri! Adri! Adri! - Carla? - [Marta whistles] - Adri? - [Adri] Let them through. What are you doing here? They let you out? No. So I'll have to be quick. Okay, what's up? Whoa, I can neither confirm or deny that this will be quick. Really I have no idea. [Carla sighs] What is this shit? My article? You... you didn't like it? This cheesy shit? - I nearly puked. - [Marta whistles] But that's what I would expect from this piece of shit magazine. Hey, show some respect, please. [exhales] Carla, what's wrong? [gasps] He's asking what's wrong? What's wrong is this garbage about how we can't be together. But that came from you. You didn't want to be with me. Well, I've change my mind! I'm bipolar! Is this how you fight for me? This is all you'll do to fight for the woman that you love? Smooth, man, really smooth. This is what I have to say to you and your article. Watch. But... but, Carla... The magazine may be crap, but the paper is high-quality. - [grunts] - [magazine thuds] [panting] For the record, I don't need to be saved. - By you or anyone. - That's what the article's about! I know that! But don't fucking ask me to save you from me either, okay? Okay, Carla. Okay what? You're right. I don't need you to save me from you. I want to be with you. [all murmuring in approval] - It won't be easy. - Yeah, well, that's my problem. Yeah, but you're gonna try to change me. I won't let you. Nobody changes me. Not you or anyone else. I love you as you are. Some days I'll get a euphoric episode out of nowhere. I know. And some days I'll want to die. I know that too. But there will be others when I'll want to kill you. Okay. Wow, but... some days I'll want you kill you so badly, so badly that I'll almost do it. Yep! - Almost? - Things will never be normal. Yeah. All of it. Are you crazy or what? Did I ever tell you I was in an institution? [laughs] [laughs] [romantic music playing] [cheering, applauding] [Adri] The next time I see someone who looks sad, I won't ask them to smile... or promise them that they can get better. If I truly want to help them... I'll try to let them know that, while I may not understand what they're going through, I'll be there if they need me. [both laughing] [romantic music continues] [music fades] - You know, you can come in if you want. - No, no, no! [both chuckling] [sighs] One second! Give me one second. Excuse me, do you have a pen? Thanks. It's 639-35-10-11. Carla. Okay? So you don't forget. Isn't that what you wanted? Get in, get my phone number, and... - And get out? - I'll call you when you get out, okay? As soon as you get out. [mumbling] - Bye. - Bye.
