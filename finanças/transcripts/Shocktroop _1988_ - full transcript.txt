(suspenseful dramatic music) (footsteps approaching) - Can you bring me in? - Yes. - When? - Very soon. - I can't keep this up much longer. - I know. (ominous dramatic music) - [Frank] Do you have somewhere for me to go? - Yes, I have a safe house for you. - What's the matter? - Nothing. (suspenseful dramatic music) - No, nothing's wrong. (suspenseful dramatic music continues) (indistinct whispering) (guns cocking) (indistinct whispering continues) (suspenseful dramatic music continues) (indistinct whispering) (camera clacking) (suspenseful dramatic music continues) (indistinct radio chatter) (guns firing) (female softly moans) (footsteps shuffling) (soldier yells in a foreign language) (gunshots firing) (footsteps pattering) (gunshots continue firing) (male yells indistinctly) (gunshots continue firing) (soldier yells in a foreign language) (footsteps pattering) (suspenseful orchestral music) (engine rumbling) (suspenseful orchestral music continues) (insects chirping) (suspenseful orchestral music continues) (door clatters open) - [Tommy] They got Frank White. - It was just a matter of time. - Well, the President's calling a meeting of the Security Council. He wants you to do the briefing. You can ride in with me. - Okay. Give me a minute to get dressed. - Cunningham? The President wants full disclosure. (suspenseful orchestral music) They'll put him on trial. - It's a great opportunity. They won't waste it. - I don't have to tell you how concerned this makes the President. You know, it's turning into a real cluster fuck at the White House. You've gotta come clean on this one. - What do you mean? - (chuckles) Hey, my office is in the dark. I think that's going to hinder our ability to handle this. Don't you agree? - The President authorized every move we made. - Oh, did he, really? Your people are out of control. All I wanna know is what happened! Start at the beginning. - We had a routine surveillance on a Soviet agent in West Berlin. (engine roaring) (crowd cheering) During the midday parade, bolts across the wall, drops out of sight. (helicopter blades whirring) Two days later, we discovered his mission. It was the last link in an operation to steal some of our high tech military hardware. Military hardware? - Very important military hardware. We had to get it back. 10 days ago, (jet drowns out speaker) Soviet territory on a snaz mission. (male yells indistinctly) (water splashing) (electricity buzzing) (suspenseful dramatic music) They found their target. (electricity buzzing) They couldn't get it back. - Then the shit hit the fan. (explosion booming) (rapid gunshots firing) (indistinct yelling) (rapid gunshots continue firing) (soldier yelling indistinctly) (explosion booming) (rapid gunshots firing) (soldier yelling indistinctly) - My eye! (shot blasting) (explosion booming) (rapid gunshots firing) (indistinct yelling) (rapid gunshots continue firing) (indistinct yelling continues) (gun cocking) (shots firing) (explosion booming) - We managed to get all the men out except Frank White. (electricity buzzing) (rapid gunshots firing) (male yells painfully) (gunshot blasting) (male yells) (indistinct yelling) (water splashing) (rapid gunshots firing) (water continues splashing) - What happened? - He stayed on the run. (water rushing) Then he went underground. He had been briefed to make contact with our deep cover operatives. (computer chirping) (suspenseful dramatic music) (soldier yells in a foreign language) (suspenseful dramatic music continues) They got him as far as the Embassy gates. Damn near made it. (suspenseful dramatic music continues) (soldier speaks in a foreign language) After that, we had to deny any knowledge. - So you left the poor bastard for dead? - In a manner of speaking. One more thing. If you ever hassle me like this again, I'll rip your fuckin' head off. (interposing voices) - They're not given their orders- - That's not the way- - How do you expect them to function- (member speaks indistinctly) (door clatters shut) - Sit down, for Christ sakes. We don't have time for this bullshit. We've got a situation on our hands. - (chuckles) That's one way of puttin' it. - The operation was run from my office, gentlemen. So some of this information will be new to you. - This is another basement operation. Why wasn't the agency consulted on this? - This was a military op. My job was to get the men in and out. I didn't wanna endanger their lives with any breach of security. - I resent the implication, General. - The president has assigned me to clean up this goddamn mess! Now, half of you don't know what the other half are doing, and that's obvious, and that kinda thing is gonna stop around here. And gentlemen, if anything, leaks from this office, I will personally kick ass! Understand? Good. (chair shuffling) We have two problems. First, they've got our man. Second, and more importantly, they've got their hands on a sensitive piece of military hardware. - [Parker] And what was that? - The Nexus Targeting Computer. - I thought that experiment was under wraps? - Apparently, the military can no longer guarantee the safety of any of their experimental programs. - What are you getting at? Gentlemen, please. We're looking at cold facts here. They've got the Nexus. That leaves us with a very unpleasant scenario. Nexus is an advanced fire control system. They've got a working prototype, not some fuckin' blueprint. Theoretically, they can have it operational on a high-end gunship in a matter of days. - Thereby changing the balance of power in the Warsaw Pact front. - Or in Afghanistan. - Precisely. The Afghans have put our Stinger missiles to good use. The Soviets are losing 30 aircraft a month. The Stingers are making them overfly their ground targets. It's the chicken shit factor. They're too scared to fly low enough for precision bombing. The Nexus is a revolutionary piece of technology. It can lock on and hit a man-sized target at 5,000 meters from a moving gun platform. - Can restore Soviet air superiority. Negate the Afghan's new tack advantage. And if they start winning again, you can just about forget about troop withdrawal. - Right now, we have to prepare for the worst. Captain White's show trial is, well, it's gonna be a fuckin' publicity circus for the Russians. An American soldier captured non-combat in Soviet soil. We are going to take a beating in the world press. That's a lot of political heat to come down in an election year. And that, gentlemen, is why we are all up at this ungodly hour. (dark ominous music) (helicopter blade whirring) (soldier yells commands in a foreign language) (rapid gunshots firing) (soldier yells commands in a foreign language) (rapid gunshots firing) (soldier speaks indistinctly) (rapid gunshots firing) (Orlorf speaks in a foreign language) (Kotchev speaks in a foreign language) (Orlorf laughs) (soldier speaks in a foreign language) (Orlorf speaks in a foreign language) (Kotchev speaks in a foreign language) (Orlorf speaks in a foreign language) - How is your English? - Quite good, actually. Why? - We have captured an American shock troop officer. - Excellent. Where? - In the Soviet Union of all places, in a combat mission. You will be briefed at headquarters. (soldier yelling in a foreign language) - We have been handed a great opportunity. - We shall make the department proud. - I won't disgrace you. (soldier yelling commands indistinctly) What kind of man is this American? - Soft, like all Americans. (soldier yells indistinctly) (rapid gunshots firing) - Sir, do you think one becomes shock troop officer by being soft? - You surprise me. The Americans are not battle-hardened, like us. We are lucky to have a war to make us strong. Do you remember our first war in Afghanistan? You are my best officer. You are strong. You should break this American. (suspenseful dramatic music) - [Member] Where are they holdin' White? (footsteps departing) - They'll take him to Lubyanka. We all know what goes on there. - What's his clearance? - Level 1 access. He knows a lot of things about a lot of us. I have information, that our old friend, Colonel Kotchev, is being transferred from his spetsnaz command. - That means he's being assigned to the interrogation. Very nasty character. - He will talk. - (sighs) I know, I know. Gentlemen, there's only one course of action. - Sir, you know White personally, don't you? - He was in my son's class at the Point, and that doesn't make this any easier. (dramatic instrumental music) (door clatters open) (footsteps pattering) (ominous dramatic music) (footsteps approaching) (cloak rustling) (footsteps clacking) - [Kotchev] Hello. I am told you are most reluctant to speak with my colleagues here. - White, Frank, Captain. 110-50-2561. - Yes, yes, yes. Name, rank, and serial number. A stipulation of Geneva Convention. You are in hell now, and Geneva Convention has no jurisdiction. So may we continue? (footsteps clacking) (sighs) I see. Maybe your first taste of new life in Soviet state is somewhat bitter? Perhaps you have been mistreated? You look terrible. You shall have bath. We will both feel much better. (Kotchev snaps fingers) (footsteps pattering) (feet dragging) (door slams shut) (footsteps pattering) (door clanks) (hands slap) (door clanks) (dramatic instrumental music) (footsteps pattering) (Frank softly moans) (clothes rustling) (water rushing) (gate clatters) (elevator motor whirring) (elevator clangs) (footsteps pattering) This camera is for purpose of recording our talk together. (footsteps pattering) Mr. White, I want you to speak to the world. I want you to explain your attack on Soviet soil. I shall expose this imperialist adventurism. - You want a confession? - If you will. - No way. - Mr. White, do not be unpleasant. You are an American soldier. You murdered Soviet citizens. You were captured as you tried to escape. You must explain these crimes. - You can forget it! I won't confess to any crimes I didn't commit! (exhales loudly) I was in Russian territory to try and recover stolen US property. We had to defend ourselves! Any Russian casualties occurred in self-defense. I was on a military mission! I demand a legitimate military tribunal! - You are a spy. You have no right to any military courtesy. Shall we continue? - I've got nothing more to say to you. - You do not understand. If we continue to butt our heads together like two rams, (fists pounding) it is you who shall have your head broken. (dark ominous music) (footsteps pattering) (doors creaking) (footsteps pattering) You have done the right thing, Mr. White. The world shall admire your courage and candor. - What are you talking about? - Shh. Your statements for international journalists. - [Voice Of Kotchev On TV] Mr. White, I understand you have an explanation for your actions? - I confess the crimes! - Is it true you are part of an American military unit caught spying in our country? - [Voice Of Frank On TV] I was on a military mission in Russian territory. - You killed- - You changed what I said. You tricked me. - [Voice Of Kotchev On TV] Why did you invade the Soviet Union? - [Voice Of Frank On TV] We had a military mission. - [Voice Of Kotchev On TV] Just confess your crimes. - Please, Mr. White. There are many more things I wish to discuss with you. - Don't tell these apes anything. What makes you think I'll talk to you? - Ah, but you will talk to me. You are in Russia, not America. You are a Russian now. We have a lifetime to talk. (train chugging) (tracks clacking) (tracks continue clacking) (Georgian speaks in a foreign language) (footsteps shuffling) - Hey, Georgian, you want to die, is that it, huh? (Georgian groans) (metal rattling) (footsteps shuffling) (Kahleel groans painfully) (Kahleel grunts) (metal rattling) (Georgian yells in a foreign language) (Georgian continues yelling in a foreign language) (Kahleel screams) (body thuds) (Georgian speaks in a foreign language) (passengers clamoring in the background) - Jesus. Dude. (Frank groans) Come on. Come on, why don't you leave the kid alone? (male speaks indistinctly) (hands slapping) (passengers clamoring) (Frank grunts) (blow thuds) (passengers clamoring) (blow thuds) (blows continue thudding) (passengers clamoring) (Georgian thuds) (Kahleel groans painfully) (blow thuds) (passengers clamoring) (train horn blares) (train chugging) (tracks clacking) (tracks continue clacking) - You saved my life, my friend. - Don't worry about it. (train chugging) (tracks clacking) - I was going to kick his ass. (train continues chugging) (dog barking in the distance) (gravel crunching) (dog growls) - [Soldier] Go, go on! (soldier yells indistinctly) (Mischa speaks in a foreign language) (workers laughing) (soldier yells in a foreign language) (feet shuffling) (male yells in a foreign language) (workers chattering in a foreign language) - Fuck you! (workers all clamoring) (Mischa speaks in a foreign language) (workers continue clamoring) (Mischa speaks in a foreign language) - Hey, nobody wants you here. You're not Russian. You're politicals. Here, in this work squad, we are like a family. You guys are bad news for us. - We didn't ask to be sent here. - You are not my family! We will not be here for very long. (Mischa speaks in a foreign language) (workers all laughing) - My friends, you'll listen to me now. This is the camp for those who have committed the worst crimes in the Soviet Union. This is the camp for hard labor. They send people here for one reason, to suffer before they kill them. We have a routine here. Every morning, we leave to work before dawn, and if we don't complete our quarter before sundown, they cut our food supplies, and make us sleep outside. In summer, it's okay. In winter, many die. (Mischa speaks in a foreign language) (objects clattering) These tin cups are your only possession. You have to realize something else. There is no gettin' out of here. You have to realize it, so that you won't go crazy. (ominous suspenseful music) (male coughs in the background) (ominous suspenseful music continues) (soldiers chattering in a foreign language) (indistinct chatter over PA) (soldiers yelling in a foreign language) (indistinct chatter on PA continues) - Who the fuck are you? - I don't know what you mean. Get your fucking hands off! (soldier speaks in a foreign language) - At least talk to me. You tried to kill me. - You don't get it, do you, Mr. Frank White? - How the fuck do you know my name? - How do I know your name? Because I was sent to kill you. - By who? - By your own people. - [Frank] Why? - Maybe because alive, you are more dangerous. (soldier yells in a foreign language) (indistinct chatter on PA) - You're never gonna make it outta here. - Yeah, I will rot in here, but my people will get their Stinger missiles in exchange for your life. It's just a deal, like any other. - Why didn't you kill me when you had the chance? - I do not kill a warrior when he sleeps. - Can we just forget about it? I mean, I've got enough to worry about here. (soldier yells in a foreign language) (indistinct chatter on PA) (dramatic instrumental music) (indistinct chattering) (chisel scraping) (rocks clattering) You wanna hear a crazy idea? - [Kahleel] Do I have a choice? (chisel scraping) (rocks clattering) - [Frank] I got a plan. We dig our way outta here. - [Kahleel] You are crazy! We're already digging. (dramatic instrumental music) (fire crackling) (chisel scraping) (rocks clattering) (shovel scraping) (rocks clattering) - There's only one guard that can see us. - No, there must be more. Two by the south gate. - [Frank] Shit! (rocks clattering) - What about your plan? - [Frank] You mean, dig our way outta here? - [Kahleel] I've been thinking about it. Maybe it is possible. (Frank groans) (gravel crunching) (wind whipping) (metal clanking) (indistinct chatter on PA) (chisel thuds) (tool thuds) (metal clanks) - We need your help. - What do you mean? - We're getting out of here. - Go away. I don't have time for this. - We've got a plan. We could tunnel outta here. - (laughs) You guys have been watching too many movies. It's impossible. - Why? - Why?! Because it's too cold to dig now. It's too cold. The ground is too hard. - I didn't say it'd be easy. The grounds like concrete. At least it won't cave in on us. - It's too far to the other fence. - 52 meters from these barracks. - You guys are serious? - Damn right we're serious. We'll start the tunnel right under the bunks. - Then you'll need my help. But remember, everyone in this work squad will know about it, and if anyone betrays us, you will die. I'll help ya. (dark ominous music) (metal clanking) (wind whipping) (feet shuffling) (male coughs) (worker snoring lightly) (feet shuffling) (board clattering) (tools rattling) (metal clangs) (worker snores lightly in the background) (gravel crunching) (plane engine roaring) (radar beeping) (footsteps pattering) - You did not break Frank White as I had told you. - I fulfilled your instructions. I obtained statements for propaganda purposes. - I was told of your unconventional methods. Have you forgotten everything that I have taught you? - I was able to outwit him, to use technical trickery. The man looked hard, strong. I thought subtler methods might bring better results. - You have brought attention to yourself. Go to the Gulag. I shall know everything that Frank White knows. Squeeze him till his every fiber is broken! Go! (speaks indistinctly) Do not fail me! (plane engine roaring) (suspenseful dramatic music) (gravel crunching) (fire crackling) (worker snores lightly) (suspenseful dramatic music continues) (male coughs) (objects clattering) - Fuckin'... - I heard something very bad from the guards. There is a man coming here tomorrow, the man we call "The Butcher of Gulag". - Who is this man? - He's KGB, Colonel Kotchev, and he's coming after Frank White. - I've met the Colonel before. - He's going to interrogate you, and then he's going to kill you. But before he kills you, he's going to find out everything you know! - I've survived him before. - This time, he's going to break your skull. - We've got 15 meters to go to hit the wall. - Then we dig all night. - Go! - We gotta. Go! (gravel crunching) (Frank softly groans) (helicopter blades whirring) (indistinct radio chatter) (helicopter blades continue whirring) (Frank pants heavily) (Kahleel grunts) (door thuds) - Times up. (tool scraping) Come on. Go to your cell, Kotchev is in the building. - [Frank] We made it to the wall. (footsteps clomping) (tools clattering) - Hurry. Here. Go, go! (soldier yelling indistinctly) (feet clomping) (Georgian yells) (blow thuds) (feet shuffling) (indistinct yelling) - [Male] Leave me alone! Leave me alone! (feet shuffling) (flame sizzles) (gripping suspenseful music) (Georgian grunts) (gunshots firing) (soldier speaks in a foreign language) (uptempo dramatic music) (soldier speaks in a foreign language) (wind whooshing) (footsteps pattering) (engines rumbling) (gunshots firing) (engines continue rumbling) (gunshots firing) (engines continue rumbling) (rapid gunshots firing) (engine sputtering) (engine rumbling) (footsteps pattering) (engine continues rumbling) (rapid gunshots firing) (engine continues rumbling) (rapid gunshots firing) (engine continues rumbling) (rapid gunshots firing) (engine continues rumbling) (rapid gunshots firing) (engine rumbles) (gunshots firing) (engine continues rumbling) (engine revs) (wind whipping) (dramatic orchestral music) (melancholic instrumental music) (electronic whirring) - Sir, I just picked up a burst code transmission. One of our deep covers. - Frank White's surfaced. He's alive. - So the dead shall rise. Our operatives didn't get to him, I take it? - He was here, a Gulag camp in Uzbek, the Soviet Republic. - Where does that son of a bitch think he's gonna go? - My bet is he's heading for the Afghan border. - Don't you realize the international ramifications of one of our men being caught in Afghanistan? It could provoke another major incident with the Russians. - If he makes it across the border, that at least gives us a chance to get him. - You don't get it, do you? I'm not sending anymore teams at the sensitive areas. We can't afford to get caught with our pants down again. Frank White is the Soviet's problem now. (wind whirring) (ice crunching) (wind continues whirring) (footsteps pattering) (Kahleel yells in a foreign language) (men all yelling in a foreign language) (fire crackling) (indistinct chattering) (wind whirring) (indistinct chattering) (male speaks in a foreign language) - [Kahleel] Sit down. You must sit down. (Kahleel speaks in a foreign language) (male speaks in a foreign language) (Kahleel speaks in a foreign language) (men chattering in a foreign language) (Kahleel speaks in a foreign language) - What does he say? - He says he will lead us to my valley. (male speaks in a foreign language) But first, we must joined forces with his mujahedin. (male speaks in a foreign language) And lead an attack on an armored Russian tank column. - Tell him to go fuck himself. - I know what this fuck word means! (men laughing) (men chattering in a foreign language) - (laughs) He likes you, Frank White! He likes you! (men all laughing) (men all continue laughing) He likes you! - [Male] Come, we go now. We will ambush the Russians at the high pass. They will know that they cannot come into our valley with impunity. (wind whirring) (sand crunching) (wind continues whirring) (tank engine rumbling) (tires squeaking) (tank engine continues rumbling) (sand crunching) (wind whirring) (tank engine rumbling) (male speaks indistinctly in a foreign language) (tank engine rumbling) (male yells commands in a foreign language) (wind whirring) (RPG blasting) (soldiers chattering indistinctly) (rapid gunshots firing) (soldier yells indistinctly) (rapid gunshots firing) (gunshots firing) (Frank yells indistinctly) - Let's go! (Kahleel yells indistinctly) (rapid gunshots firing) (rapid gunshots continue firing) (male yells painfully) (sand crunching) (rapid gunshots firing) (sand crunching) (soldier yells commands in a foreign language) (rapid gunshots firing) - The Russians, they will send many helicopter gunships, but we will go through the desert. Be very hard, very dangerous. We might die. - Do we go? Yes. - Very good. Very brave. Okay. (sand crunching) (wind whirring) (dramatic orchestral music) (helicopter blades whirring) (feet shuffling) - [Kahleel] I curse these high helicopters! These infernal machines have killed more of my people than anything else! - We're good, man. Set your sights for 500 meters. If they come in the opening here, try and lead 'em by about 100 meters. Just try and put as much lead up into the sky as you can. We're not gonna go cheap, guys. (helicopter blades whirring) (Frank speaks indistinctly) Yes! (Frank speaks indistinctly) (suspenseful dramatic music) (wind whipping) (gripping dramatic music) (Frank pants heavily) (gripping dramatic music continues) (wind whipping) (Frank breathes heavily) (rock clattering) (male grunts) (rocks continue clattering) (wind whipping) We've gotta keep going. Come on! - There's no way. - Come on. (Frank grunting) (rocks shuffling) (wind whipping) (gripping dramatic music) (water trickling) (men pant heavily) (gripping dramatic music continues) - [Kahleel] Allāhu ʾakbar. Allāhu ʾakbar! (water trickling) (water splashing) (wind whirring) - [Achmed] My village is through those far mountains. Many days march from here. But if we go through this pass, we will save much time. (wind whipping) (rocks crunching) Come on. Got it. (Frank grunts) (rocks crunching) (wind whipping) (Kahleel grunts) (water trickling) (gripping dramatic music) This is my home. You will be welcome here. (griping dramatic music continues) - Kahleel! - Musa! (Musa speaks in a foreign language) (gripping dramatic music continues) (engine rumbling) (indistinct chatter on radio) (engine continues rumbling) (suspenseful dramatic music) (soldiers chattering in a foreign language) (suspenseful dramatic music continues) (soldier speaks in a foreign language) (electrical static whirring) (wind whipping) (footsteps pattering) (male speaks in a foreign language) - [Achmed] And this is Marguerite. She's a French doctor that's staying with us. She's helping my people. (indistinct chattering in a foreign language) - [Frank] How'd you end up here? - I came here with a medical team from France, all of us with high ideas to save lives. One by one, they left. They couldn't take it. It's so frustrating, you know, to try and help these people. Sometimes I want to give up. You know the number of casualties that I have to deal with every day? - Yeah, I've seen. - Yeah, and the Russians are bleeding those people. Very soon, there will be no blood left. - Yeah, they're beaten. They've been beaten for years, except no one bothered to tell them that. - Yeah, they're crazy. They will fight to the last man. - I've never met people like this. Neither have the Russians. - So Mr. American, what are you doing here? - I'm just trying to help, just like you. (male coughs in the distance) (mellow instrumental music) (wind whipping) (electricity crackling) (letter crinkling) (soldier speaks in a foreign language) (suspenseful dramatic music) (wind whipping) (rocks crunching) There are many Russian tanks coming through the pass. - [Kahleel] Have you ever seen tanks such as this? - Yeah, (tank drowns out speaker). (wind whipping) (tanks rumbling) (Kahleel speaks in a foreign language) (indistinct chattering) (men chattering in a foreign language) - Kahleel, my scouts tell me the Russian tank army is rolling into our valley. This is not good. - No, I know this is not a good thing, but I think we can fight them. - How could we fight Russian tanks?! We will be crushed underneath them! We must leave this valley! - No, no, no, if we stop them before they reach the valley, we can defeat them. - We cannot fight them! - Elder, please, will you listen to me. This man, Frank White, here, he can help us. - This American infidel here? How can he help us? How could he help us fight the Russian tank? - He has fought the Russian tanks before. He knows how to kill the Russians. He is not afraid. He saved my life. - Where was he five years ago when my family was killed? Where were the Americans then?! - All I ask is that you listen to him. - Okay, I let him speak for you. I let him speak. I listen. - You ready to listen? You're gonna be facing mostly armored personnel carriers, a couple T-74s. It's a tough son of a bitch. I think I know how to take 'em down. (tank engine rumbling) Russian tank doctrine is fairly predictable. Their soldiers aren't taught to think for themselves. That's their main weakness. Also, I don't think their heart's in this war. We hit 'em hard and fast, I think they're gonna break and run. (gun cocks) (tank gears squeaking in the distance) (gun cocks) (gun blasting) (explosions booming) (rapid gunshots firing) (male yells indistinctly) (rapid gunshots continue firing) (soldiers yelling indistinctly) (rapid gunshots firing) (soldier yells commands indistinctly) (rapid gunshots continue firing) (explosions booming) (tank gun blasting) (explosions booming) (soldier cheers excitedly) (tank engine rumbling) (rapid gunshots firing) (soldiers clamoring) (rapid gunshots continue firing) (male yodels) (suspenseful dramatic music) (rapid gunshots firing) (soldiers clamoring) (tank engine rumbles) (gun blasting) (explosion booms) (explosions continue booming) (rapid gunshots firing) (soldier yells in a foreign language) (tank engines rumbling) (soldier screams) (blows thudding) (male yodels) (gunshots firing) (rapid gunshots firing) - [Achmed] Allah, be praised, we have done it! You were right, Frank. We beat them, Frank! (mercenaries all cheering) (gripping dramatic music) - Tell me, what do you have to report? - The reinforcement column for my sector has been destroyed by the rebels. - That devil destroyed Soviet armor? How is this possible? - They are now being led by the American. - I do not understand. - He set a clever trap. The motor rifle squads panicked. Whatever else, the man is a good fighter. - You idiot! You him again! Why have you let him slip through your fingers? I don't give a damn what you think of that bastard, you will catch him, or we are both finished. Is this clear? (Kotchev speaks in a foreign language) Find him. Destroy anything that gets in your way. Do you understand? (plane engine roaring) That is all, friend. (Orlorf yells a command in a foreign language) (gripping dramatic music) - Sir, I have something interesting for you. Data from the tracer net on Colonel Kotchev. - Is he moving? - They just mobilized his (speaks indistinctly) command. They're being deployed to Afghanistan. - Captain White is becoming quite a problem. I guess our friends realized the mujahedin couldn't take out half a tank division by themselves. - Sir, there's something else. - Go on. - He has Nexus with him, installed on his command chopper. - They must want Frank White pretty bad to put their prototype at risk. I hope the irony of this situation doesn't escape you. - Sir? - Nevermind. (mercenaries cheering) - Your war making, did it go well? - Yeah, we stopped an entire armored column. Tonight, I almost think we could win this thing. - You're very proud, Frank White. Is war such a manly contest? - You wouldn't understand. - Yes, I do. But isn't there enough killing? Don't you see their misery? - These men are my brothers. They took me in, that's why I fight for them. - Yes, I know about this. My father was general in the Free French forces. He told me all about war. - Did he really? - Yeah. So do you think you made a difference now? - Yes, I do. I really do. - Okay then, I have something special to celebrate with. I've just been waiting for the right person. Come on, come with me. (insects chirping) (liquid sloshing) Do you like music? - I haven't heard music in six months. - I've had this short wave radio. (electronic static hissing) Do you want to dance, Mr. White? Come on, everybody dances. Come on! Just a dance. (uptempo jazz music plays on radio) Life is too short. We may not see tomorrow. (uptempo jazz music continues playing) (Frank speaks indistinctly) (Marguerite giggles) (suspenseful dramatic music) (footsteps pattering) (suspenseful dramatic music continues) (helicopter blades whirring) - It's a great victory we've won, Frank White. - Yeah, it has. - And this is because of you, and my people will always remember this. She's very beautiful, huh? - Who? - Marguerite. (Frank mumbles) She's been alone for five years, Frank. Do you like her? - Yeah, I like her. - If you like her, you must marry her. - It's not the way we do things in my country. - But Frank, if you find love at a place such as this filled with death, you must keep it. You must hold onto it. You cannot let love like that go, Frank. - You might be right. (helicopter blades whirring in the distance) - Helicopters. - Let's take cover. - No, they're heading for the village. - Come on. (clicks tongue) (helicopter blades whirring) (indistinct radio chatter) (helicopter blades continue whirring) (horse hooves clomping) (helicopter blades whirring) (footsteps pattering) (dark ominous music) (soldier speaks in a foreign language) (dark ominous music continues) (footsteps pattering) (soldier yells indistinctly) (suspenseful dramatic music) (rapid gunshots firing) (male yells indistinctly) (rapid gunshots continue firing) (soldier grunts) (gunshots firing) (rapid gunshots firing) (cloaked figure yells) (male yells) (rapid gunshots continue firing) (male screams) (rapid gunshots continue firing) (soldier yells indistinctly) (rapid gunshots firing) (soldier yells a command indistinctly) (rapid gunshots firing) (male yells) (objects clattering) (male grunts) (rapid gunshots firing) (patient groans painfully) - Now, we shall find this American! Bring her! (soldier yells indistinctly) (horse hooves clomping) (dramatic instrumental music) (rope scratching) (dramatic instrumental music continues) - (groans) They have taken many hostages. The French nurse among them. - Who did this to you? - Who did this? - Captain Kotchev. - Why didn't he kill you? - He has a deal to make with you, Frank White. He will meet you in the Valley of the Keys at sundown. You will come alone. (dark ominous music) (dramatic instrumental music) (footsteps pattering) (door creaks open) (door clatters shut) (soldiers speak in a foreign language) (Kotchev speaks in a foreign language) (soldier speaks in a foreign language) (door clangs) (wind whipping) (suspenseful dramatic music) (gravel crunching) - You have lived with these Afghan animals for so long you have come to resemble them, Frank White. - Animals? They're not animals. They're men just trying to fight for their freedom. - They are murderous peasants. - These murderous peasants have managed to hold off 10 of your Russian divisions for nine years. - I require you to voluntarily surrender, so that you may publicly account for your war crimes. (suspenseful dramatic music) - [Frank] I think I've come a little too far for that. - I have many prisoners stinking up my brig. I shall need to eliminate them. One of them is quite lovely. She speaks your name as I question her. You have 24 hours. Why don't you give yourself up? - Why don't you kiss old buck? - I have two high gunships on station over that far ridge. - Should make fat targets for my Stinger missiles. - And so a stalemate. You have 24 hours. (footsteps departing) Now I shall have your Frank White. - You'll never get a man like Frank White! He'll never give up! (prisoner mumbles indistinctly) - The trap has been set, and you are the bait. He will come, mm-hmm. He knows what happens in a place like this. (Kotchev yells a command in a foreign language) (prisoner mumbles indistinctly) (blow thuds) (prisoner screams) (prisoner grovels in a foreign language) (soldiers speaking in a foreign language) (prisoner groans painfully) (wind whooshing) (fire crackling) - We have to go in there. - Then we are dead men. - What else can we do? - This is suicide. There are 500 Russians in that fort. - Kahleel, your village has been massacred. - Kotchev will kill all of them. - Without our people, we are dead men anyway. That is how we must think of ourselves. - You are right. We must fight them. I have no life without my people. - All right, I've got a plan. It's half-assed. It'll get us in the fort. (rope whooshing) (suspenseful dramatic music) (indistinct chatter on PA) (suspenseful dramatic music continues) (indistinct chatter on PA) (suspenseful dramatic music continues) (chickens clucking) (suspenseful dramatic music) (chickens clucking) (dirt clattering) (suspenseful dramatic music continues) (suspenseful dramatic music continues) (suspenseful dramatic music continues) (blow thuds) (soldier screams) (soldier groans) (Frank grunts) (blow thuds) (knife whooshing) (soldier grunts) (soldier groans painfully) (body thuds) (gravel crunching) (footsteps pattering) Quickly, we don't have much time. The guards will hear us. Come on, move! (footsteps pattering) (insects chirping) (gripping dramatic music) (blow thuds) (gripping dramatic music continues) (feet clomping) - [Kahleel] This part was easy, Frank, You have a plan to get to the perimeter now, or we are going to die? - [Frank] I'm fresh outta plans. - [Kahleel] You're fresh outta plans, huh? This would be a good time for one, don't you think? (men grunting) - Listen, I want you to do something for me. I want you take her. Keep her here. Achmed and I will go create a diversion at the perimeter. - [Kahleel] I don't watch women. I'm a fighter. I'm a soldier, Frank. - Can you do that for me? - Yeah, I just- - Stay with him. Achmed. - He never has a plan. He never has a plan, you know? Never! (footsteps pattering) (insects chirping) (gripping dramatic music) (soldiers chattering indistinctly) (rapid gunshots firing) Come on, come on, I'm fighting. Come on.

It's Kotchev's command chopper. That fucker's got the Nexus on it. (shot blasting) (explosion booms) (soldiers clamoring) (explosions continue booming) (Frank speaks indistinctly) (Achmed speaks indistinctly) (explosion booms) Goddamn! (Frank speaks indistinctly) Let's have a little fun. (gun blasting) (explosion booming) (gripping dramatic music) (blow thuds) (Marguerite screams) - Frank White! (Marguerite continues screaming) Frank White! (Kotchev yells indistinctly) (gripping dramatic music) I know you're out there! You come to me! (Marguerite screams) Frank! Frank White, come here! (suspenseful dramatic music) There you are! Frank White, step out of the shadows! (insects chirping) (footsteps crunching) - No, no, no! - Drop your weapon, or I will shoot her! (gun clatters) You'll come with me, but I won't harm you. I have come a thousand miles to hunt you down, but I lied. (evily laughs) (intense dramatic music) (knife whooshing) (Kotchev groans painfully) (Kotchev gagging) (explosions booming in the distance) (suspenseful dramatic music) (dark ominous music) - Only Allah knows why such a brave man should die. - Everything was taken from him, his family, his people, his life. - Pay a high price for freedom around here. He knew that. All he would want from death is that we keep his memory alive. - We have a saying, only those who are forgotten are gone. He'll be honored at our campfires for his battles forever. Will you stay and fight with us, Frank White? - No, I can't. - (scoffs) How can you leave now after all you fought for? I don't understand. - I have to go back and fight for my right to be an American again. For my freedom. - And I must stay. I will find you some day. - Goodbye, my good friend. Goodbye, and good luck. - My good friend. (dark ominous music continues) (car engine roaring) (dark ominous music continues) (car engine roaring) (car door slams shut) (car engine roars) - Waverley! Waverley! (claps hands) Come here! Come here, Wave! Come, come! (car engine roaring) (suspenseful dramatic music) (Cunningham mumbles indistinctly) - Just another day at the office, Cunningham? - (sighs) It's amazing. - I didn't think you'd be glad to see me. - Of course I'm glad to see you. Wanna put that goddamn gun down, for Christ's sake? - You gave us a fucked up job to do, and when we pulled it off. - Excuse me, Captain, you didn't pull it off. - You don't know what I've been through, but I got the Nexus. Blew it to hell. Mission accomplished. - You were captured. - Instead of trying to get me out of there, you sent someone in to kill me. - There was no gettin' you out, Frank. We couldn't even admit that you existed. I mean, that goddamned confession of yours really blew the lid off this thing. - I didn't confess. - I know that, but that's not the point. You try explaining that after you're all over world TV. There are no secrets in the Gulag. Eventually, even you would've broken. We played it by the book. What do you want me to do? - I don't know. - And why don't you try being professional about this? You know the game we're playing here. I mean, I spent three and a half years in Beirut, before that Karachi, Teron, La Paz. Half the time, I never knew if my car was gonna blow up. I mean, that's the business, Frank. You chose to be in it. And I'm happy you made it back. I really am. - [Child] Daddy. Daddy! (footsteps approaching) - Hi, son. How you doin'? And sweetheart, how you doin'? Oh, god, it's good to see ya. It's great. You go and thank this over, Frank. Come by the agency Monday morning. So how was the game? All right? - Yeah.
