Kimberly. I wouldn't have come if it wasn't urgent. From the top. 'Tass Agency. Moscow. April the twenty-seventh.' But that's six months from now. The death of Sir Philip Kimberly was announced here today. 'Former director general of British Secret Service. Defected.' It's all here. Yes. They can't do this. Andropov will never allow such a crazy... You're out of date. Feydorchuk has taken over. Feydorchuk knows I've been an important asset to this country. An international figure. Yes, here we go again. I was forced to defect only when that American Michael Straight turned in that little shit blunt. And that's another story we've all heard before. I was going to get a cabinet post. I might even have been Primer Minister by now. If you should go back to England now, you'd not get five years in the House of Commons. You would get probably thirty years in Brixton jail. Is that it? That's what they think? That I'm planning to go back? - Crazy. - You have been restless, discontented. A nuisance and a drunken embarrassment for a long, long time. The worst of them all. Even worse than that drunken scum Philby and Burgess, and that wretched MacLean. But it was last week that you killed yourself, at the dinner, when you kissed the Minister on the mouth. But Boris, I was drunk. We were all drunk. For once in our benighted life, we were having a good time. But that was before you peed on the table. I don't remember, I passed out. First you passed water, then you passed out. A joke, Boris, a joke. Tovarich. - Tovarich Kimberly? - Yes. No, no, no. Welcome to the KGB second main directorate, comrade Kuzminsky. Christ. Good luck, young man. Faster, faster. No, wait. Come here. All stitch marks are gone. He's ready for the General Sorin now. Kimberly, you mustn't miss this. Yes, it's not everyone who gets to see his own funeral. I thought all that was yesterday. It was. They're showing how the rest of the world received the news. The funeral yesterday of Sir Philip Kimberly, once head of the British Secret Service, the SIS. Has brought sharp, quick reactions from America's CIA. And other intelligence sources to whom he was a familiar figure and one of a long line of British traitors. Starting during the cold war with Klaus Fuchs. Fuchs had worked in the U.S. nuclear laboratory at Los Alamos, where he passed our atomic secrets to a KGB courier, Harry Gold. His other contacts with the Russians came through Julius and Esther Rosenberg. In spite of repeated American warnings to British Intelligence that two of their top Embassy officials were passing secrets to the KGB, nothing happened until... A recent visitor to Moscow was Mr. Tom Driberg on the right, who went there to meet one of the missing diplomats, Guy Burgess. But all of this was a warm up to the preliminaries before the main event. One of the great names in espionage history, Sir Philip Kimberly, director general of Her Majesty's Secret Service. Knight Commander of the British Empire, Grand Commander of the French Legion of honor, American's Legion of Merit, Knight of the Golden Fleece and hero of the Soviet Union. And the only foreigner to hold the rank of Lieutenant General in the KGB. Comrade General. Doctor. And this is comrade Kuzminsky. With your new face, you've been given a new identity. You'll go back to London as commercial attache to our embassy. An extremely important dossier is missing somewhere in England. And this concerns the commercial attache, comrade? The dossier contains a record of every payment made to our agents in the West since the early thirties. We have reason, always had reason, to believe that you alone can restore to us that dossier, that payroll list. I have absolutely no knowledge of it, comrade. It's our belief that in the last hours before you made your escape from England, you stole it and hid it. Your intention was always to bargain with it, if things became difficult for you here. That day has come. The day to bargain, comrade? A Russian diplomatic passport. In return for the dossier you've hidden, there are one million Swiss francs to your credit in a numbered account in Zurich. Dollars would be nicer. Comrade Colonel Medvachian, you will accompany him to London to receive the dossier. At which time you will telex to unblock the money in his Swiss account. I know you didn't work for the money, but all the same, one million francs. That's all, wait outside. Medvachian, you stay. Make your entry into England from a foreign city, Paris, Rome. Don't fly Aeroflot. Kensington Palace gardens know just enough to be helpful. I must say it's wonderful to be forty-two again. Think I'll live to be forty-three? If comrade Kuzminsky fails to deliver the dossier, our two friends here they make sure he doesn't. You will hand over that pay list, won't you? What pay list? Think of it. One million Swiss francs. Even if you don't like Switzerland. I can think of many worse places to be. For instance? We'll separate. You go up in front. Keep an eye on Kuzminsky. When was this passport issued, Mr. Kuzminsky? If you please? The date stamp and the signature seem indistinct, a little blurred. This is your writing? That is correct. How long do you intend to stay in England, Mr. Kuz? Kuzminsky. What do you think? Local time is 11.24. On behalf of the captain and crew, we wish you all a very pleasant stay in London, and hope to see you on TWA. Again before long. If you come with me, Mr. Fraser, I'll get you off first. They coming out to the plane? Have to. Our parking place is a long way out. We're about fifteen minutes early, that's why. You must be pretty important. Police car, special treatment. Public enemy number one is the real reason. I'll come and see you in prison. Bring a cake with a file inside. That's what I call service. Thank you for looking after me. Come again. Mr. Fraser, great pleasure to have you back, sir. Thank you, Parson. Private lift. The Admiral is expecting you. Thank you. Yes, yes, Home Secretary. Yes, I understand. The point I'm trying to make is that this is a matter for Secret Intelligence services, and not for Immigration and Customs. If you were to have Milroy call me. Thank you, Home Secretary. You missed all the fun at the airport. A defector. Matthews told me. I saw that report you sent in our Washington diplomatic bag. Very pricey these days information. Like whiskey. Not so pricey as mine, sir. Two lives, Paul Carraciola and the young American. Did Carraciola kill himself or was he helped? - Suicide. - Why? He wasn't entirely a happy man, sir. I asked you why he killed himself, you clown. Paul Carraciola was homosexual. So? So he had a rather emotional relationship, sexual, with the American we finally got the information from. That was his function, to get information any way possible. So we could blackmail this wretched American. Only sensible law we've made in England this century, 'Consenting adults', would've saved Vassall and MacLean, and Burgess too, of course. Not that I think he wouldn't have done it even with a hedgehog. Read that? 'Sir Philip Kimberly, some time director of MI6.' Dead. - Scarcely believable, eh? - Well, he was sixty-two. A ripe age to die in your humble opinion. Think we've all had it by sixty-two? - Well no, sir... - My arse. Fortunately for most of us your humble opinion means less than a fart in a blizzard. - Sir, I didn't mean that... - It's alright, never mind, never mind. You ave done a good job. Lost a good man, but done a good job. Thank you, sir. On my behalf and on behalf of the good man. Poor old Kimberly. Kimberly. His name will always be magic. Like some great, great chess player. Yes, that's what it was. It was all a game of chess to him. - It wasn't the money at all. - Sounds as though you admire him, sir. Admire him? Brilliant. And now his usefulness at an end, they do him in. Swine, eh? You think they chopped him? Aggravated cirrhosis of the liver. Aggravated by a bloody bullet in the liver. You never knew him or Lady Kimberly? Always felt we pushed her too hard. Hedged in, poor thing. And she wasn't really involved. Only as a wife and a mother. Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful Annabelle. Only one way out for her, and she took it. High window. Didn't do much good for England's image. We looked brutish and nasty. I was still posted to Lausanne and I can remember the little girl. Poor kid. Yes. You never lost your interest in poor little Penelope, did you? I tried to keep in touch as she grew up. Then it's no coincidence you've been sleeping with her for the last 12 months. 14 months. And nothing to do with coincidence. She fell in with a rough bunch when she came home from Grenoble university. Had a rather unhappy, sordid, love affair, didn't like it.. And I was there. So you took advantage. That's how it'd look to some people. Well, that's all. You've done all right, I suppose. Oh Frazer, now that the Kimbarly case is finally ended... you go on screwing the daughter with a clear conscience? You miss accommodating, sir. Thanks, Benny. Penny, it's me, Jamie. Thank God. Jamie. - The telephone. - No, no. Leave it, don't answer it. The newspapers, they've been calling all morning. You've heard. Yes, I've just arrived. I came on straight here. How did they find me? For almost ten years I've been Penelope Black, not Kimberly. They never let go. Poor love. I'm so glad you're back. I've missed you. How I missed you. Penny... You smell nice. It's amazing what you can do with a bit of mouthwash and aftershave. Where have you come from today? All over. The United Nations all over? Well, I did at least get your postcards. Working for the UN, I get them free. Charming. Lane's garage. Sorry, wrong number. I wish that'd stop them, but it won't. They'll be camping on the doorstep next. - So move into my place. - Your place? But it's so tidy. - Never make love in your place. - Who said anything about love? Make scrambled eggs, Buck's Fizz, yes, but love, no. Although on the other hand... Zip up your bag and I'll get you out of here. I was going away anyhow, going to the cottage. - Got your keys? - Yes. You hear that? Should I leave a note for the cleaner? Your cleaner is capable of seeing anybody off. It's a new coat, newish. Tailored by Donaldson Hudson, Saville Row. Vicuna, fine vicuna. But what's particularly aggravating is there are two tickets for the Cup final in the inside pocket. I want the CID to make this... Hold it right there. Oh, Admiral. You are? Detective-sergeant Lloyd, sir. CID West End Central. Enlightening if I may say so. Admiral, I do think... I also heard news of the loss of your fine vicuna coat, from the sergeant at the door. News of your grievous loss, Milroy, has spread down these corridors of power. People grieve with you. Shall we fly the flags at half mast? Or shall we forget your fine vicuna coat and the Cup final tickets? Meanwhile I suppose the news of your other loss, that of the defector Kuzminsky has not been spread so wide nor so far as that of your fine vicuna coat. Really Admiral. You've got to stop thrashing about your bloody coat, do you hear? Admiral, I... The Russkies must not learn we've lost their bird without even clipping its wings. You've got to act as if we'd still got him. Now do you understand? - Yes, I quite understand. - Right. Now let's start again from the beginning. After all it was you who went to escort him here from the airport. Tell me, how did he seem? Agreeable, perfectly pleasant. Knew London. Said he'd served here before. Served here before? Is that when he asked to see me? Well, as I told you on the telephone, he mentioned your name. He just mentioned my name. Didn't it seem to be curious that he knew my name? No, never mind that. Go on. Go on. Well, I seated him there. - In that leather chair? - Yes. I gave him a cigarette and the 'Times', and I left him to arrange accomo... As a matter of fact, I had to wash my hands. Weak bladder? When I'd got back, he'd gone. While you were washing your hands, he'd washed his hand of you and taken your vicuna coat with him. He'll get a good price for the tickets and for the coat too. And that's the trouble. He's now walking about with money. Has this room been printed? Printed? Fingerprinted. Your flighty friend who knows my name may be someone that we know. He may have been in and out of the country many times. In and out, in and out. Just as he was in and out of your office. You think he may be known? Wanted? Perhaps not known, Milroy, but wanted, surely. Send a print team round at once, will you please, sergeant Lloyd? - Sir. - Thank you. - Admiral, you've forgotten this. - Thank you. In case I do hear from him, how much shall I offer for your Cup final tickets and for your fine vicuna coat? Admiral. My dear Milroy. Sir James. I take it you're on your way to visit me. Just stopping by. - Slumming, Admiral? - Like you, just stopping by. As we've already stopped, we won't trouble Milroy any further, shall we? - But Sir James... - Let's go to the Athaneum. Unless you prefer something else. Whiskey? Not thirsty, thank you. You don't need a thirst for whiskey. I take whiskey only when I'm feeling cold. Then bugger you for a start. Thank you, Admiral. Gentlemen? My usual, please. And for you, sir? No, thank you, but I will have a little wine with our dinner. - I'm took for dinner. - That's a shame. Wanted to invite you round the corner, to Wilton's. Lashings of smoked salmon, followed by turbot. And a bottle of Montrachet from Wilton's special bin. I feel like lamb tonight. Lamb. Exactly what you're going to get, dressed as mutton. Tell me, was there ever any truth in that legendary file. K was supposed to have squirreled away somewhere? It's just the sort of thing he'd have done. The entire housekeeping bill of the KGB operations in this country from the beginning. Highly unlikely. But we'll never know now, shall we, old man? Call that a double. - Sign for me, Albert. - Very good, sir. Silent toast to K.? - Bugger off. - I'm not. Go and take a little wine with your turbot and be damned. A better man is putrefying in his box. Look at it this way, sir. If he hadn't gone off, you wouldn't be head of Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence services, now would you? See it realistically, Annabelle. Philip is gone. Already there in Moscow. No one will believe you didn't know. Now you will need help. What are you trying to tell me? That I'm in love with you, Annabelle. Always have been, but you know that. I thought you were Philip's friend. Marry me, Annabelle. - I can protect you. - Please, go away. Please. You're a fool, Annabelle. Wherever you go, you'll be hedged in. A swarm of agents everywhere. You will never see Philip again. I'll see to that. I will. Sergei Kuzminsky. I am Russian commercial attache who is defecting this morning. Are you indeed. You are Admiral Scaith? More people know Tom Fool than Tom Fool knows. Excuse me? It doesn't matter, I said nothing, doesn't matter. What do you want? I come to you from Philip Kimberly. My friend, you come too late. Philip Kimberly is dead. Yes. At last Philip Kimberly is a free man. I was with him at the end. I was with him for ten years. I was his friend. A friend with a gun in his back. - My gun was not loaded. - A friendly gunman. Philip Kimberly told me to come to you. I am to sell you the documents he removed from our British paymaster before he escaped to Russia. You're telling the truth? It's what Kimberly is telling me before he died. I know him like a brother. I have all proof you want. The documents will do. The exchange of monies and items for sale can be made in Switzerland. I'll be needing British passport, safe conduct, and proof that money is there, before documents can be examined. How much do you want? - One million pounds sterling. - You know you're talking nonsense. Why do you say nonsense? You've wasted many millions more pounds in last ten years in search for these documents. But if you do not agree my price, there are four, maybe more, major powers, be very interested. All have trusted agent at same time in pay of Russia. Why didn't you wait at the Home Office so that we could bargain in comfort? Why did you run out? In Home Office is possible I am also killed in comfort, by someone of your people before allowed to speak with you. Killed by someone who perhaps has his name on files I offer for sale. Is very much possible, yes? Possible, anything is possible. The next defector could be a member of the Royal Family. All right. I'll have a special line open for you direct to my house for the next seventy-two hours. It will have the Chiswick area code, that's 994, followed by four zeros. But you will have to undertake something better than promises. Some definite evidence this obscure dossier exists. Is reasonable. But I will need two telephones here, in case one does not work. Very well, two telephones. In Kimberly's time, went this way many times with him. Yes, Philip Kimberly speaks to me many times of this river path, of your habits. You keep whiskey bottle behind your books, black label whiskey. Wonder why he should tell you that? He also tell me of policeman always on duty outside your house. Run, man, run. You took your time. Strolling off my dinner. A man must consider his digestion. Sit down and listen. This'll do your digestion some good. The Kimberly dossier, the paymaster file, it exits, and it's up for sale. - You were approached? - Kuzminsky. The defector who cut out on Milroy. And that's why he cut out. - You have him? - He ran. Knocked out a policeman behind the pub. Damn near killed him. I want the police to show a low profile on this. See to it. The Russkies must not hear their man is loose or trying to make a deal with me. Fine. Pick up his passport and description from Special Branch. I want your people to catch this bastard before the police fall over him. My section is pretty strung out right now. I hear Paul Carraciola is back with Fraser. Let me have Carraciola. Can't have him. Fraser brought back the official NYPD photos, Waldorf Astoria. Polished his shoes, clean shirt, measured the distance perfectly. Had quality this Carraciola. Luck of the draw. Give me Fraser then. Done. Don't struggle, don't be frightened. It's me, Philip, your father. Please, don't be frightened. All that stuff you read about me in the papers, my obituary, it's all lies. Please, don't be frightened. Stay calm. It's me. I'm going to let you go. Please, don't scream out. But when you turn round, you won't recognise me. What do you think? Bearing in mind that it's a Russian suit. Now get out. Get out of here now. I don't care who you are. I know it's a shock. But you won't be needing that popgun, lovebird. Lovebird. It's a long time since you heard that, isn't it? Lovebird. In any case, I'm afraid that someone has already beaten you to it. You're Philip. Yes. Not the thing for an open wound, but... - We must get you to a hospital. - Yes, that's why I came to you. We've got to get out of here. They know about this cottage from the letters you wrote to me. They? Who's they? The KGB. Killers. Pen, you can't come back here or go to your flat in London for at least a week. I'll have sorted things out by then. What are you going to do? You can't go around like this. Well, I'll go to a chemist in town. And then, after that, we'll go to the lake to that place where we used to picnic, where we could see everyone and no one could see us, do you remember? Yes. I'm glad you too. - Those files... - Let me help. - If I'd gone along... - Here. With their little plans... All I could win was a real obituary. But since I cut loose yesterday, I have spoiled those plans, so now they will try to use you to force me back. If they do take you, you'll be in Moscow by midnight. That's what I fear. You fear for my life. It's the paternal instinct, Penny. It dies hard. You'd better get going. Go off to Ireland, or Scotland, or to the Crowleys, or to a hotel. - Anywhere. - But what about you? I have unfinished business here. Yes? Like dying here? Unfinished business. I have no intention of dying yet. Good. In that case I'm going to take you to some friends of mine. They own a hotel. You won't be found there. We could put you up until Friday, but we're booked for Easter. - Thank you, that's time enough. - The name is? Fraser, H. Fraser. Would you and Penny want a table for lunch? No, thank you. I'm really not feeling very well. Room number eight. You know the way. Thanks, I do. There. Bright, cheerful and safe. Fraser H. Why that? Hamish Fraser, my boyfriend. I thought at least I'd know what name you're under. What does he do? United Nations. He works for the Narcotics Division. Travels the world. Talking of that, he'll be traveling to the cottage this afternoon, I'd better stop him. No. Call box will be safer. There's one downstairs. No, listen. I'm fleeing the cottage. It's damp and dreary. Can I come and stay at your place? Lovely. Yes. No, I'll be there before six. No, I'm taking the train, the car is playing up. Lovely. No, look, I can't really talk right now. I really can't, darling. I'll see you soon. Yes? Big kiss. Bye. Est servi. Good God. Bangers. How I've missed them. Funny the things one can't forget. Bangers, England. Did you know that Burgess always wore his old Estonian tie? And Philby never wears any tie at all? I've missed more than sausages. Penny, there's some things I have to tell you. But not in here. All walls have ears. This is England. The Bull hotel does not have ears. I've got to be in London by six. You can't go back to your place. I'm not going to. I'm staying with a friend. This Fraser? Fraser H.? He's the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. Anyway, I've got a living to earn. I'm all day tomorrow at the Dorchester hotel, translating at a convention. Clever girl your daughter. Speaks five languages fluently. I even plodded through a course in Russian. - Thought it might please you. - Yes, you wrote to me. Why didn't you ever write back? Right, sir. What is it now? A mister Cameron. Scotland Yard. Can't you see I'm having breakfast? Tell him to wait. Come right in, Mr. Cameron. He's a nice face, an honest face. Sorry to disturb you so early, sir. Well, well, well. - Tea? - No, thank you, sir. I'm in charge of fingerprint section, Scotland Yard. These are the prints taken from Mr. Milroy's leather chair at the Home Office. And? And I went to my office at seven this morning, knowing it's urgent, and I am off to see my wee daughter for the weekend. - She's married now. - Indeed. The matching prints. Yo will see, sir, why I felt it best to come straight to you. - Good God. - Aye. Philip Kimberly. Sir Philip when he first went to Ml6, was screened by us.???? We did a proper job, unlike some other departments. No. Not possible. I can't believe it. Seeing is believing, sir. But I saw the man who made these prints. He was half Kimberly's age for a start. Prints can't lie, but the face of a man? And women too, so I've been told, aye. And even criminals to create a new identity. Bless you, Cameron. The prints do not lie. They transformed him and brought him here for a purpose that only he could accomplish for them. One thing, sir. Why did they not burn off his fingerprints with acid? Because, Cameron, they'd no intention of ever letting him out of their clutches until he fulfilled his purpose, but... he defected. The idea. Lovely. Talented, rascal. He's not finished with his chess games yet. In the mornings, plenty of choke and no acceleration. She has her habits. Will you be all right? They missed my ribs. I'll live. Only if you take care of yourself. Go back to the hotel and rest. You must take those antibiotics. You don't want to get blood poisoning. What do women use to change the color of their hair? Shampoo rinse. Shampoo rinse? Yes. You can buy it in the chemist. Take this. When I come back, I shall bring 200 pounds. Emergency money. Take care. - Your driving license, please. - Excuse me, officer? Nothing wrong with your eyesight, I suppose. No, officer. Prohibited zone. Fifty quid fine and your license endorsed. This must be something new here, because... Well, I haven't been back in the old country now for twenty years. American? Tourist? Kind of a tourist. I have a British passport still. I'm very proud of that, but I've lived in Oklahoma now for thirty years. I drill oil for a living. In the interests of the British economy... Now that you know, don't do it again. Thank you, officer. I sure won't. And as they will keep saying in your country, have a nice day. Yo too, sir. That's very lovely. You've done wonders. I'm just about to lock up. - We're just leaving. - Thank you, ladies. I don't want to disturb you. There is no hurry at all. Just a prayer of thanks to be here again. Long time. As you see, we're preparing for one of our big Sundays, the Ascension into heaven. I feel we ought to be more dramatically reminded of the descent into here. Goodbye, Mrs... - I see you were admiring our angel. - Yes, I remembered her from the war. Of course in those days I, too, had wings. - Ah, a flyer? - Yes, I was stationed hereabouts. - In and out of Woburn, training. - You were one of those, eh? I was out in the desert. Seventh Armored. Fighting for a better world. Yes, and I'm afraid we have to keep on doing it. It's choir practice tonight. Rehearse for this Sunday. Meanwhile it's brightening up a bit. I'm going to try and get in a round of golf. Well then. Goodbye, maybe we'll meet again one of these days. I doubt it. Have a good Ascent. Bye, bye. Wait here, please. I'll be a few minutes. Sus? Penny? I've been ringing you everywhere. Have you? Is the dragon out? The dragon is always out. No customers, anyway. Might as well dust down the Albert Hall. Listen, Jamie is back. So I'm staying with him. - Moving in? Lucky you. - No, no, no quite like that. Trying to. - Want this? - Thanks, Penny. - Don't answer the phone. - I won't. I thought you might like to stay there with Ginger. - It's still Ginger, isn't it? - Still Ginger. I'll tell mother I'm staying with you. - Want some tea? - No, thanks. I must go and get supper. I've got to create a good impression. - Don't lose my keys, please. - You know my bag, safe as houses. Could live for a week on everything that's in it. Ciao. Coming, Ginger. Hello? Yes, Admiral. I hate to disturb your amative carnalities, but I do require you in the office with Chorley first thing in the morning. What? Russian? Not a word. You have received my letter with instructions? Yes, yes, it arrived first thing this morning. I found the snippet of micro-film very interesting. Rest of the film is posted to Geneva. Got that intercept yet? Hurry. We make exchange in Geneva. But first you pay half of money to daughter of Kimberly, - here in England. - Agreed. My courier will... You were saying your courier? I was saying, one moment. You can forget the intercept. It's a waste of time. I was saying my man will meet you at Woburn Abbey, at two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, in front of the sweet shop at the children's zoo. Your money will be in a red case. You can check it. And then go with my man. My man will escort you to Geneva. You can trust him completely. I'm grateful your escort is a safe man. I must leave you now, but perhaps one day you will visit me abroad for a pleasant holiday. If ever I visit you, it'll be to put my boot up your double-dealing Russian arse. I have made all the arrangements at Woburn. The marquis and Henrietta Tavistock have given us everything we need. So you better get down there pronto. I'll join you later. The Russian is no fool. He knows the playground and zoo will be stiff with kids, - so there'll be no guns going off. - There will be plenty of guns to go off. The police, the Russians, not to mention ours. He likes to live dangerously, doesn't he, our Kuzminsky? At least we're going to play straight with him. You're going to make the contact, then you're going to see him off on a Royal Air Force plane to Geneva. Why me? Because you're so good at making contacts, aren't you, dear boy? You all right, sir? It wasn't me, sir. Sorry. Who then? Hard to say. With all they lions and their keepers, monkeys and those keepers, the giraffes and giraffe minders, it could be anyone. But to shoot at my car? - Could be a stone. - You heard the shot. Aye. There'll be some people who are after shooting the squirrels today. Pretty little things, but pestilential. Besides, no car allowed on these side roads. Except for family. Trespassing. You be a trespassing car too, sir. Friend of the marquis. Afternoon, sir. Accident? Can you organize some temporary transport and get this repaired? Yes, sir. - Is Sir James here? - Somewhere around. I'll show you the temporary HQ. Yes, we are. Any information to be sent to SP2, SP2. Over and out. - Sir. - Anything moving? One Green Line driver reports he thinks he saw our man. For section use only. Fraser. Keeping my eye in. Bagged these for you, dear boy. Memento mori. Thank you, but to the hunter his spoils. Yes, dear boy. Yes. I'm at the Bedford Arms if wanted. Like a prick. Don't you think it's like a prick? Maybe not like Mr. Mouse, but like a big aggressive prick. You think me vulgar, don't you? Yes, I've seen it in your eyes. Paul Carraciola didn't think me vulgar. Paul liked me. And not many people know I wear a wig. Doubt if even old Scaith knows. I have four wigs. All different lengths. Change them every week. Until it looks as though I need a trim. Paul Carraciola liked the medium one. Poor Paul. You were with him, weren't you? At the Waldorf, when he... I wasn't with him. I was in California. Take a look at my report. I can see it's a sensitive subject, for you as well as for me. A melancholy subject, and as far as I concerned, closed. Yes, closed. Tell me about the accident to your car. Did you see anyone? Must've been a stone. I presume you got the report about the woman seeing our Russian on the bus. He wouldn't have been on the bus if Scaith had held on to him. Held him? A lame old man up against a Russian thug who half killed a copper with a single blow? You've always been the Admiral's boy, haven't you? Well, I suppose someone has to take his place. Don't you find yourself a little youthful for the role? I'm quitting the service as soon as the Kuzminsky file is wrapped. If you'd quit before, before going to America, Paul Carraciola might still be alive and well and living in London. Strange. Safety razors are the thing, old boy. These can be dangerous weapons. They do their job. Yes. I'm just across the corridor, nice and close. What a curious life it is. Well, on with the motley. And you won't let on about my wigs, will you? Bad for morale, I'd say. Hello? Hello, Ginger. How are you and Sus? What you mean? I gave her the keys to my place days ago. I thought you were together. She can't be too sick to pick up a telephone. That could be my fault, actually. I did tell her not to answer it. No, don't be silly. Of course she hasn't disappeared. I don't really want to go there because of the newspapers. All right, I'll come with you. Look. Jesus. Where's Sue? This all there is? No other rooms? No. That bloody suitcase of hers. She wouldn't move a foot without it. My keys, where are my keys? No. No, Sue. What's the matter? Snap out of it, Penny. No... it's Sue. I'm in terrible trouble, and now she's involved. What trouble? What's happened to her? You know me as Penelope Black. That's not my real name. I'm Philip Kimberly's daughter. Sir Philip Kimberly, the spy. Kimberly. The one in Moscow? Yes. When he died, he sent a man with a message for me. They didn't want me to get that message. - Who? - The Russians. I don't believe a word of it. You're bloody mad. Listen to me. Please, listen to me. He came to warn me, this man, that I was in terrible danger, the Russians would do anything to get their hands on me, anything. Hijack me, hijack me to Moscow. Which is what they've done. They thought it was me. Ging... Ginger... Close to window. Let no one see you. That van, that green van, was there when you arrived? No. It pulled up as we were going inside. Squeaky brakes. What the hell are we whispering for? - If you try to take the mickey... - Go back to the window. There's only one other person who can help us now. If I was you, I'd take a couple of days complete rest. You look as if you could do with them. - Yes? - Philip? - Hello, Penny. - Give Penny my love. Yes, yes. The place here is in a complete shambles. They've obviously been here, the Russians, they've taken her by mistake. - She's probably gone home. - I must go to the police. Don't be such a bloody fool, Penny. You can't go to the police. Now wait till tonight. She'll come to no harm. Don't be stupid, Philip. She could be dead by tonight. She's no good to them dead, is she? I mean she's got a tongue. She can explain. In Russian? In Moscow? Now let's both calm down. I'll speak to the Soviet embassy myself. Don't be stupid, she might be dead by tonight. And another thing, Philip. There's a green van which has been following me. It might be the police, but more likely it's the Russians. Penny, do you mean you're speaking to me from your apartment? Well, get out. Get out now. Get out. What a stupid cow. The phone is tapped. We have to get out of here. And the Russians out there? You think they'll let? Quick, the door, get the safety chain. - I'm going to call the police. - No, no. You're not. Philip. Have done him enough harm. Screw Philip. - I said no. - You silly... The window. I'm going to shout for help. No. Don't go over there, they might see you, and shoot you. Come over here. They're going away. No, they're not going. Go away. Go away. Miss Kimberly. Miss Kimberly. Go away. We've already called the police. We're the police, or the same thing. Look at this, for God's sake. It's a hell of a long time since I was last asked to show this card, but read it. What shall I do? I knew you. I've known you. I knew your mother for more years than I'd like to mention. But read the name. You'll know it. No, don't. How do we know? Look out of the window, you bloody young fool. I presume you know a police car when you see it. Thank God you're here. Whoever you are. The living image. These men, they've been here. Yes. Two, two of them. Russian diplomatic passports. - There's nothing we can do. - And the van, the green van? It's all right, it's already gone. This is Ginger, I take it. And Susan is locked in where? Were you here when she made the call? Answer me, damn you. Were you here when she made that call? Yes. - Take him in. - No. Don't hurt him, don't you dare. He has nothing to do with this. - He doesn't... - No one is going to hurt him. Tell me, where was Philip when you talked to him? I'll tell you if you bring Susan Graham here. Tell your thugs to go and get her. They've got her. We haven't. Do you begin to understand? Sit down. Transcripts of your conversation to Ginger this morning. We've just recently picked up a conversation between you and Philip, in which you implore him to take you to the Soviet embassy. Now Philip is in danger, great danger. We must get to him before he is shot down either by the comrades or our own police. Penny, where is he? He warned me not to tell anyone. You might be working for the Russians and only waiting to kill him. Do I look like anybody's bloody comrade? The Bull hotel at Wargrave. Anybody there? Ah, there you are. I'm just off to pick up Penny, she wants her car back, so if you'll give me a bill, I'll... I heard you speaking to that girl. Everybody could hear you shouting. We're very fond of Penny and you'd better explain... - What on earth... - before you leave... - What are you talking about? - Perhaps we'd better get the police. Look sharp, the old man is on his way. Roger. You'd better wash this, madam. What's all this? Nice time of the day to get home and no warning. Think we had a full staff. Anyone would. Butler, lady's maids and all. Polly, this young lady's had a nasty shock. Take her to the kitchen, give her a cup of tea, some of your nice anchovy toast. I'll call when I'm ready to have a chat with her. Come in, my dear. Matthews, take it round the back, you and Connolly - cover the side door to the bar. - Right, sir. His wife. She's identified Kuzminsky from the passport photograph. I see. Thank you. Polly, send the young lady in. Come in, Penny. Sit down. I've got more bad news, I'm afraid. The landlord of the Bull hotel, Mr. Ransom, he's been killed. Doug? No. It was your father. Whether it was an accident or he killed him and threw him down his cellar staircase, I don't know. However, whatever, he must feel terribly threatened. Scaith here. Yes. You mistrust someone close to me. I said anything is possible. I see. Then we'll change the place of the rendezvous. The church just inside the gate of Woburn, instead of the children's zoo. Right, right. There's one other change. This time it's mine. Your messenger will be a woman. Long fair hair, blue jeans, Grey jacket, yellow scarf. Yes, we'll bring a doctor. - That was my father. - Yes. You didn't ask him about Douglas Ransom. No, irrelevant at this point. What will happen to him? I shall keep my promise, if I can, and get him to Switzerland. It's the documents you want, isn't it? Yes. And you plan to send me as your messenger? - Why? - He will be more pliable. All right, I'll bargain with you. - Bargain? - Yes. I'm bargaining now. I want Philip Kimberly to stay dead. He died in Russia. He knew nothing of this. It was that man, Kuzminsky, do you understand? Yes... I understand. I understand you, miss Kimberly. I'll go to the church and I'll do what must be done. So long as Philip Kimberly remains in his grave, agreed? Yes, it's as I would've wished it myself. Yes, sir? Fill her up, please. Hey, hang on a minute. He's got to be some kind of a lunatic. - Seen this man? - No, don't think so. - A yellow Mini? - Just now, he's gone out like a bat out of hell. Left me with a tenner. Two in one morning. Where have you been? Kuzminsky is been sighted. Bull hotel, Wargrave. - I was on his heels... - Never mind, orders from the Admiral. Cancel all previous instructions. Operation Paymaster is been scrubbed, we're not taking Kuzminsky in. What the hell's going on? I don't know what the devious old bastard is up to. I'll tell the people at the zoo it's all over. Call from the main gate, sir. There's an ambulance arrived. Orders from Admiral Scaith. Stationed in front of the church. Driver wants to know if there're any further instructions. The church? My God. I knew the old bastard was up to something. Penny. What's she doing here? It's all right. Kuzminsky, we've got Kuzminsky in there. - You've what? - It's all right. Half the money is for her. Her father planned it all. Kuzminsky is merely the go-between. Then he goes with us to Geneva. It's all right. Penny. Philip. Who brought you here? Admiral Scaith sent me. Everything is going to be all right, Phil. There's an ambulance and a doctor waiting for you. You look so sick. I promise... Jamie? You tricked me. No, I didn't. Move to the right. Move to the right. I didn't, Philip, I didn't. Put that gun away, you won't need it. You lying bastard. You have to believe me. I'm your friend. Put your hands on seats in front of you. You too. Reach down the back of the statue and take the package out. Get down, Kimberly. Hold it there. Drop gun on floor. Kick it towards me. Get away quickly. The vestry door. Not yet. Do you see how these bastards tricked me? Get the package. Get the package. - Throw that package over here. - No. Kuzminsky is a killer, do exactly as he says. Fraser. There's your traitor. He's the mole. Move. You move, move. You too, round the column. Right back. All of you, back, back. Hurry, man, hurry. Stand back. Don't let Fraser get away. Chorley, a bloody imbecile. Philip. Philip. Philip. Philip. Philip. Quick, get out, Penny. Come on. Come on. - Quickly. - Down. Quickly. Philip. Phil. Sorry about your friend Douglas. It was an accident. War is bad. Doesn't matter. Philip. Philip. Philip, can you hear me? Philip. No need to shout. Dear God. Will he be all right? They'll look after him properly. Fraser, take Chorley in the other ambulance, then report to headquarters, will you? Fraser. Scaith's man. Scaith's headquarters. Loved Paul, even when he went away. Left me, left me for a younger man. You. It drove me mad. How could you have let him down for that Kimberly girl? Any girl? Dear God. You've got your wires crossed. The man Paul was involved with was the one we got the ciphers from. - The American, of the CIA. - That was the man... not you? And I tried to kill you twice. Damned near did. Kimberly, did he die? Yes, last Monday, in Moscow. No, Fraser. I arranged it all with Moscow. Plastic surgery. Kuzminsky is Kimberly? Brilliant, eh? - Did Scaith know this? - Must have done. Shouted 'Kimberly, Kimberly' all over the church. Of course. I thought he was calling out to Penny Kimberly. Chorley. Chorley. - No hurry. - Ok, sir. Did he say anything before he croaked? That he'd been working for the Russians for at least 20 years. Anything else? Only that he'd tried to shoot me twice. Thought I'd taken Carraciola away from him. Before these ugly rumors get circulating, get in there and warn your girl there's not a word of truth in them. Second floor, number twenty-six. Just see that his wig is on straight, will you? - Very good, sir. - He'd hate anyone to know. Yes, sir. You should be in bed. I keep telling her. She's had an anti-Tet shot, but the dressing is fine. But she should stay in overnight. You persuade her. At least have a good strong cuppa before you go. I borrowed these. They've got to go back tomorrow. I suppose this is what you've come for. Dear God, you had it all the time. Yes, I did. - Anybody else know? - It's all you wanted all along, isn't it? You have done your duty, kept in touch with Kimberly's kid, kept her under supervision. Tell me, the whole performance, was it worthwhile? Penny, it's really not as simple as that. They used me too. They also used others. Susan, did you forget about her? Terrified. Probably tortured. No-one to turn to. And Douglas. Poor decent Douglas. They were not soldiers, damn you. It's probably my fault. I should've turned Philip in first place when I first knew. You could have confided in me. In you? The narcotics fella? Always such a busy, running around the world. What do you want me to say? Nothing. Don't say anything. Just go. Tomorrow? No. Goodbye. Never a goodbye between us, remember? I guess this belongs to you. Close the door quietly. I still have the gun. Turn. Hands against the wall. Do what you are told and everything... Easy. Round up the others. Get a doctor to this man. Philip. Kuzminsky. You all right? Is it safe to put on the light? Now it is. - Are you sure? - What do I do with this one? This time it's not Aeroflot sitting in the front compartment with your vodka and caviar. This time we've got the guns on you. You'll do ten years and none of your diplomatic nonsense either. Let me in. Maybe a zip fastener is what I should have sewn in. - I'm in good health. - Aren't you the lucky gentleman then? No gangrene and you bleed like a baby. I'll stitch you later. - Please, please, I must go in. - Miss, you can't go in. Jamie. Darling, I thought you'd been killed. No, the pillow got most of it. You just called me darling? You poor thing. Are you all right? I'm now. In many ways I think I am a very lucky gentleman. I also think I am a very lucky lady. Come on. Goodnight, miss Kimberly. I was forgetting. I'm sure somebody better have this. Anything I can get you? - Vodka, the holy vodka. - None of that foreign nonsense here. You're in England now, whiskey it'll be. Holy whiskey then. You'll have to give me something first, information. Who's going to come out of the woodwork next. The moles in the secret service, or the ones at Cheltenham? Much more important. That fellow Milroy. Whatever did happen to his fine vicuna coat? You lying tricky conniving bastard. There's only two frames on this, the rest is all blank. Naturally, the rest are in Geneva. Sit down. I want to make a proposition to you. Proposition? Neither of us two is getting any younger. Of that I am painfully aware. Have a drink. Once in Geneva, you and I and the micro-film, why don't we go into business together? Only this time not for five million dollars, but for five millions pounds.
