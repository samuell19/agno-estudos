(phone rings) - Well, Mommy isn't here right now. - [Eve] Collins residence. - Eve, the traffic is just awful. Tell Mr. Collins I'll be home as soon as I can. - [Eve] Of course. - Thanks. Thank God for nannies. - I wasn't sure if you'd be here to tuck me in. - Who loves you more than anyone? - Mommy. - And who's the one person in the whole world you can count on? - Mommy. (giggles) (gentle music) - I shot an 85 today playing golf with O'Brien. He beat me by four strokes. Took me three ways for 30 bucks. That was my day. Married people tell each other about their days. It's your turn, go ahead. - I'm sorry I'm late. Didn't Eve give you my message? I was shopping, I lost track of time. The traffic was horrendous. - I could grill you on what stores you went to. I could demand that you show me what you bought. - Stewart please don't do this. - I can make you show me the receipts. - Stewart. - Where were you? - I was at Bloomingdale's for shoes. Neiman Marcus for perfume and Bergdorf's for a dozen sailors who made love to me all afternoon. (gasps) You always liked it rough didn't you? - Isabelle. You won't make a fool out of me. What the hell is happening to us? - Sold to the lady on table number three at 1500. (audience clapping) I'm sure you and your family will enjoy it for many years to come. (audience clapping) Next, item number 626. Quite an unusual item this. Created by the artist Salvador DelGado. The only one of its kind. Bidding will begin at 2,000. 2,000 it is. Do I hear 2500? 2500? 2500, we have 2500. 2500 going once. 2500 going twice. 3,000, we have 3,000. - It's not worth that much. - Do I hear 3500? 3500? 3500? We have 3500. 4,000. - Isabelle would you stop it? - 4,000 going once, going, 4500. - 5,000, we have 5,000 dollars. 5,000 going once, 5,000 going twice. - 8,000. (crowd murmuring) - 8,000. We have 8,000 dollars. Going once, going twice. Sold to the gentleman on my right. (crowd clapping) - When can we go home? - Home? Honey, how many other the little girls can say they've been to a grown up party like this? Come on, sit down, sit down next to mommy. - Isabelle, you're going to have to settle this for us. Your husband is arguing that the economy can't possibly expand without the threat of inflation. - James, just because my wife is an authority on spending money, does not make her an authority on the economy. - That's enough out of you. What do you think? - My husband's right. My expertise lies in other areas. (laughing) - I'll see you later. - Excuse me. I'd like to introduce myself. I'm Richard Davis. - I'm Stewart Collins and this is my wife Isabelle. - And I'm Ruby. - Well, you're as beautiful as your mother. I hope there are no hard feelings about the brooch. - Of course there are. My wife never forgives anyone who prevents her from getting what she wants. - Well then I'll have to work extra hard to make restitution. Perhaps I can begin by asking your wife for this dance. - Excuse me. (ballroom music) - You're a very gracious winner. - Must be the rented tux. - You carry it well as if you were born to these soirees. - I'll take that as a compliment. - Oh, here's another. You're a very good dancer. - Thank you, it takes awhile to learn to give yourself up to the music. - Give yourself up? That sounds scary. - Not if you have a partner you can trust. - Someone who understands rhythm, tempo? - Exactly. - Someone who knows when to slow down? - When to speed up? - These days it's so hard to find a man who knows how to lead. - One may be closer than you think. (ballroom music) - You know I can't get over that Davis guy. Spending all that money on a brooch. (chuckling) Who was he trying to impress? - You sound like it's personal. - You were the one who seemed to make it personal. - Stewart. We just danced. What's your point? - There's no point, it was just an observation. - I'm tired, let's not argue. Besides, you know I only have eyes for you. - I hope that's true, Isabelle. - You know it's true. - No, I don't know that that is true. - Well then, I'll just have to prove it to you. (moaning) - [Woman] Isabelle, I told you not to go out there. Your father doesn't want to play. He'll just ignore you anyway, Isabelle. He doesn't care about anyone but himself. It's a trap Isabelle. You don't need him. You can't trust him. Don't expect anything from him. Learn to take what you need. You have to stay in control. Don't expect anything from him. You have to stay in control. Learn to take what you need. Stay in control. Stay in control. You have to stay in control, Isabelle. Stay in control. Stay in control. Stay in control, Isabelle. - Stan, you're killing me, you're destroying me. - [Stan On Phone] Tell you what. You take the sloop off me for 260 and I'll throw in a sunfish for free. - Stan, the boat has a gash in its hull. - [Stan On Phone] Just a little one. You put 5,000 into repairing it, you resell it for twice what you paid. - Uh huh. You got it all figured out don't you? - [Stan On Phone] Yeah, I do. - Okay, I'll tell you what. I'll give you 185,000 but you have to haul it up here yourself. - [Stan On Phone] It's a deal. Thanks Rich, you know I appreciate this. - Mm hmn, I know you do, you should. I gotta go. (clears throat) What am I gonna do with a boat that's got a hole in it? - Sounds like you're a softie. - He's an old friend. He's having a hard time. - I come bearing gifts. Time you had one of your own. That auction is not the last time you're gonna need a tux. - Thank you. I kind of surprised myself. I had a pretty good time. I might even sell a boat or two. I don't know what I'd do without you. - Well let's not ever consider that possibility. - Aren't you afraid somebody will see us through the windows? - Not any more than I ever have been. - It's kind of interesting seeing Stewart for the first time. - And? - He doesn't seem like such a bad guy. - Well, Stewart is at his best in a public arena. - Uh huh, and I'm more of a private arena kind of guy, huh? Country clubs, prep schools, charity auctions. It's a whole different world where I grew up. - Well, you're in this world now. It suits you just fine. - Maybe. Somebody asked me to come back tomorrow and speak at the Maritime society seminar. - Are you surprised? I mean, you know so much more about boats than any of those old fogies. - The only thing I know is how good I feel when I'm with you. - Wouldn't it be nice if it could always be like this? - It could be. If you divorce Stewart. - Shh, don't ruin things. - In the three months and two weeks that we've been together all I've heard about is how much happier you are with me. - You don't understand. Stewart would never let me have custody of Ruby. So let's just enjoy what we have. - I've got something for you. - You do? - Yup. - What is this? - Open it. (gasps) - Oh, Richard. You didn't have to. I didn't expect this. Oh, it's beautiful. - I want you to have it. - Oh, you know I can't wear it. - Sure you can. When you're with me. Looks perfect. - I'll treasure it. - Where you going? - I'm thirsty. Want something to drink? - Sure. Surprise me. - Don't I always? (gasps) My God. - What is it? - Outside, there's a man. - Where? - There's a man out there. - Where? - I know he was there. - I don't see anybody. - Stewart did this. He's having me followed. - What are you talking about? - He knows about us. - Since when? - I've gotta get out of here. - Isabelle has this happened before? - I've gotta get out of here now. - So what if this happened? So what if he knows? - You don't know Stewart. - Isabelle, Isabelle wait. - I can't, I can't. - Isabelle. (suspenseful music) (cellphone rings) - Hello? - You're right, somebody was following you. - Stewart suspects. - [Right] What did he say? - I can't talk now, we got into a fight and he got violent again. - Isabelle I want you out of that house now. - Thank you very much. (dial tone) - I enjoyed that so when we can do it again I'll make myself available. Thank you very much. - Davis? Stewart Collins, we met the other night at the auction. - Yes, how are you? - I'm fine, I didn't know you were a member here. - I'm not. At least not yet. I've applied. I'm not sure I'll make the grade. - Well, we have to keep the riffraff out. - Excuse me? - I'm joking. Just joking. - The Maritime society asked me to speak at one of their panel discussions. - Is that right? Well, why don't you join me for a cigar? - They let the riffraff smoke cigars in here? - Well, we'll make an exception just this once. Come on. So what is it you do again? - I own a yacht brokerage business. - Oh, you sell boats. - Does offshore investments sound better? (laughing) - My wife loves boats. You remember my wife don't you? - Yes. - Beautiful woman don't you think? - Yes, she is. - Great dancer. (chuckling) I don't like boats. Never did, never will. - Different strokes. - I'm kind of a land guy myself. I like to know I've got solid ground underneath me. I'm the kind of guy that likes to build a fort, dig a moat and then defend it with everything he's got. You know what I mean? - Yeah, I'm a lot like that myself. - There, you see? You and I have something in common. Are you looking for this? - You scared me. - Where are you running off to? - To meet Evelyn. I haven't seen her in ages. - I want to talk to you. - I can't, I'm already late. - Well then a few minutes more isn't gonna matter is it? - You wouldn't let me have the real thing. So I treated myself to the costume version. - What about this? - What is it? - It's a bill from a detective agency. - I'm having you followed. - Me? - If you're cheating on me I want to know. - Oh you are sharp, Isabelle. Just be careful you don't cut yourself. - I have to go. - New rules, dear. I'm reeling you in. You have no more access to my money. There's no credit cards. If you want a blessed red cent from me you get down on your knees and you beg. Like the good little wife you are. Isabelle. You forgot something. (tense music) - Damn it. (tense music) - All right, let's see what we got. I think we left one jar of caviar back at the shop. Maybe I should go and look. - Oh, stop. I just bought the bare necessities. - Champagne, brie, some necessities. - When you taste the pâté you're gonna think you died and went to heaven. - Isabelle, it's just food. - We're gonna have so much fun. - [Richard] You know, a sunrise on a sailboat is pretty hard to beat. I wish you could spend the whole night some time. - [Isabelle] Oh, me too. - How's that? It's great. Just a little bit higher. Higher. (moans) - Okay, higher? - Perfect, yes. - What's that? - Huh? Oh, nothing. - It's not nothing. It's a bruise, how did you get it? (exhales sharply) - Richard stop, really, it's nothing. - Stewart did this didn't he? - He didn't mean to. We got into a fight and he... - And he choked you? You've gotta get out of that house. - I can't. - If he won't give you a divorce, we'll just leave. - Richard, you don't know Stewart like I do. - You and me and Ruby will just disappear. - Richard, I tried to leave him once before. He tracked me down in less than a week and dragged me back. - Well then, we'll go to court. We'll get a restraining order. - Richard, it just won't work. He's too well connected. I can't run away. If I did he'd find me. He'd take Ruby from me. (sighs) - Guys like Stewart, I've watched them my whole life. They think all they have to do is look at something and they own it. - It'll be all right. Everything will be all right. It really will. (soft music) Don't worry. I had a wonderful afternoon. - So did I. And the pâté wasn't bad either. - I'll see you soon. - You can count on it. Drive carefully. - Okay. - Isabelle. Isabelle. Are you okay? - I think so. - Are you sure? - Uh huh. - I saw the car sliding, I thought you were gonna go through the fence. What happened? - I don't know. The brakes. The brakes, I pressed, and nothing happened. - There's a clean cut right through the brake line. He's out of his mind. - Oh God. (crying) - I'm sorry. Here, here, you're trembling. - I just can't believe that Stewart would actually do something like this. - If he would sabotage your brakes what else do you think he's willing to do? - Richard you know what this means. We're gonna have to break it off. - That's just what the son of a bitch wants. - Stewart's won, he's won. - Isabelle, no. You cannot go back to Stewart. Do you want Ruby growing up in the same house with him? What about us? I love you. - He's too powerful. He's too connected. - No he's not. - You don't know Stewart like I do. - For enough money anyone can get connected. - I don't understand. - We have to take care of him before he takes care of us. - What are you talking about? - I'll take care of everything. - Richard. - It's all right. I just want you to trust me. Trust me. Plain black coffee please. - Live a little why don't ya? I recommend double mocha cappuccino with the arabica blend. (sniffs) One for me, he's buying. - Are you Mike Lee? - No, I'm Juan Valdez. My donkey's parked around the corner. - Coffee guy, very funny. Here you go. - Go ahead sweetheart. - But he's playing golf. - I know, he won't say yes but he'll like that you wanted to be with him. Then ask about the bike you want. Go ahead sweetheart. - Hey, there's my girl. (whispering) Well, you're not gonna have any fun watching daddy hit golf balls all afternoon. (whispering) Okay, okay, okay, all right. I don't think you need a ten speed quite yet. You're becoming more and more like your mother every day. - I'm doing some research and I saw your name, Soldiers International. - Hey, 10% discount for mentioning the ad. - I guess you've been in some pretty risky situations. - Look, I gotta believe you're not here for my memoirs. Why don't we just cut to the chase? - Okay. If a person wanted another person eliminated could that be arranged? Hypothetically. - Not by me. - I thought you had some experience in this field. - Look, I'm a professional soldier, a mercenary. Have AK-47, will travel. What you need is a contract guy, hypothetically. - Could you give me a name? - I might. It'll cost you more than a cappuccino though. - There has to be another way. - There isn't. - Richard please don't do this. - Look, I'm not gonna sit by and do nothing while your life if being threatened. - But you're putting your life in danger too. - Once I make the arrangements there'll be nothing to worry about. - What if something happens to you? - Nothing's gonna happen. The only thing that's gonna happen is that we're gonna be together. Like we planned. (background chatter) - [Man] Paging all units. - Are you Kevin Doggett? - Are you my limo driver? - You still need work? - All I need right now my friend is a drink. - Okay. - Okay. Cheers. - I'll tell you exactly where to find him and when he'll be alone. No. 7500 now, 75 when it's done. - Okay, but I want that money. I want it in small bills, and I want it 10s, 20s. Aren't you prepared? - I want it done as soon as possible. Early next week, Monday or Tuesday. - Pretty good. At your service. - Tomorrow afternoon, make sure that you're in public and seen by lots of people. - I don't know if I can go through with this. - Stewart upped the ante. We're just protecting ourselves. - I know. But I'm scared. - I know you are. Everything's taken care of. (expectant music) - Don't do that sweetheart, it's so unfeminine. (expectant music) - [Man] Sir. (ballet music) - Stewart Collins. - Who the hell are you? (gun cocks) Take whatever the hell you want, you get out of here, okay? - [Doggett] Thank you, I will. - [Richard] I barely saw you, I can't identify you so nobody's gotta get hurt. - Except you. - Leave my family out of this all right? - Your family? Your wife's out with the kiddies and the nanny's got the day off. - How did you know that? How did you know that? Did somebody set you up on this, huh? Did somebody set me up on this, who? - Shut up. - Are they paying you? They're paying you aren't they? - Oh, deal maker. You want to make a deal? - Yeah. I'll match it, I'll double it. Just tell me how much they're paying you, come on. - Now, Stewart. It's a lot of money. It's like $20,000. - All right, I'll give you 40 right now. I got 40. I got 40 right in the study, here. I got a gold watch, right here. You take this right now, that's gotta be worth 10 grand. Come on, take it. Take it. - Wow. (ballet music) - There. Take it. - You're doing really good. I just wanted to tell you that. We're almost done right here. I just gotta get you to do one last thing. Could you possibly get on your knees and on the floor? - Why? - Why? Because I don't want the cops getting here before I get a chance to get away because you called them so on your knees and let me tie you up with something. Put your hands behind your back. (ballet music) - Nobody has to get hurt. We're just a couple of business men right? - Yeah, right. (gun cocks) And a deal is a deal. (ballet music) (gunshot) (ballet music) (gunshot) (parents applauding) - Hello? Is anyone home? Hello? Mr. Collins. Mrs. Collins. Is anyone here? (ballet music) - Excuse me, we're looking for Mrs. Stewart Collins. - Oh, um, Ruby's mother. Well, there's Ruby in the pink and it's the woman talking to her. - You were inspirational. You could be a prima ballerina one day. - Mrs. Stewart Collins? - Yes. - I'm Detective Beers, this is my partner Detective Nelson. We're with robbery homicide. - What is this about? - May we speak with you privately? - Ruby honey, why don't you go back and ask Mrs. Charles what your costume's gonna look like. - [Beers] Mrs. Collins, I'm sorry to inform you that your husband is dead. - What? - We're very sorry for your loss, Mrs. Collins. But we're gonna have to ask you some questions. - Where is my husband? I have to see him. - The medical examiner is at your house. We need you to identify the body. - Excuse me. I have to be with my daughter. - Of course, we'll check in with you later. - Ruby, we have to go. - What's wrong mommy? - You have to be mommy's brave little girl now. Something terrible has happened honey. Something that will change our lives forever. I don't understand who would do something like this. - [Nelson] That's what we're trying to find out. - [Beers] What did your husband do for a living Mrs. Collins? - He was in investments. - What kind? - I never really understood. Some kind of venture capital. - Did your husband have any enemies? - Not that I know of. I'm a little confused. One of your officers said this looked like a robbery? - We need to look at it from all the angles. - A man of your husband's wealth and position might have ventured someone's capital who wasn't so happy with the results. - I just can't believe it. Stewart is really dead. I can't believe this is happening. - How much cash did your husband keep in the lockbox? - Maybe a few thousand dollars for emergencies. - Did he keep anything else in there? - I never opened it. He never gave me the combination. - Mrs. Collins, we're sorry we have to ask you this question but did you and your husband have any problems? - Problems? - Marital difficulties. - God, no. Stewart and I loved each other. Of course, we bickered now and then like all married couples. I just don't know what I'm gonna do without him. I can't believe that he's really gone. I can't believe it. (sobbing) I'm sorry. I'm sorry, this is hard for me. I relied on Stewart for everything. - I'm sorry for your loss. Thanks a lot. Nice job officer. She's a good looking lady. - She didn't spend too much time asking us how soon we're gonna catch the killer. - Maybe she reads the papers. Maybe she knows the odds of catching a perp nowadays. - Maybe, maybe, maybe. (sad music) - What are we gonna do without daddy? - We're gonna depend on each other. Can I count on you to help me? - Yeah. - You're the most important person in the whole world. The most important person in the whole world to me. We have to be strong for each other. It's just the two of us now. (sexy music) ♪ Yeah yeah ♪ When we gently kiss ♪ Gentle fire - What are you doing here? (gasps) - I'm sorry. I just had to come. - You shouldn't be here.

Thank you. - [Richard] You're welcome. - [Isabelle] Want to show your friends? - [Ruby] Okay. - She liked it. - Yes. - What a beautiful necklace. I don't believe you've introduced us, Isabelle. - Oh, I'm sorry. Martha Clark, this is my friend Richard Davis. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Martha is an essential part of our little community. She makes sure that all the gossip is relayed in timely fashion. - [Officer] That's right sir, uh huh, okay. - [Beers] No Denny's tonight. - [Nelson] So what else is new? - [Beers] She's already seeing another guy. - So? - So, ha ha. I like to think when my time comes that Hannah's gonna grieve more than four weeks before she starts dating another guy. - All due respect to your wife Lenny, Isabelle Collins doesn't strike me as the kind of woman who's gonna be sitting at home on a Saturday night. - Well, something stinks, okay? - Look Lenny, we talked to the nanny, the gardener, the neighbors, his friends, her friends. We came up with nothing. - Nothing huh? Well listen, what if she was seeing this guy on the side before her husband got whacked? - We got no proof of that. - Not yet. - As Stewart's attorney and a friend to both of you it's my responsibility to make sure that Stewart's assets are transferred to you without complications. - I was wondering Harold, and I don't know much about these things, but would it possible to have some of Stewart's assets liquidated? - Well yes, but it could take some time. It's a very complicated set of transactions. - You see, without Stewart's income I'm afraid that Ruby and I will find ourselves short of cash. - Yes, of course. Stewart had several industrial properties just west of here which might be put on the market. Let me make a couple of calls. - Thank you Harold. I just can't tell you how lost I feel with Stewart gone. I don't know what I would do without you Harold. Richard. You didn't tell me that you were coming over. - No, I know I didn't. - Is something wrong? - Yes, there is. It's my arm. It's my right arm. - They're gorgeous. What's the occasion? - I didn't know there had to be an occasion for flowers. But, actually I suppose there is. I've been doing a lot of thinking Isabelle and I don't want us to live separately anymore. I think Ruby loves me. Is she here? And I'm very fond of her. I want us to be a family. - What are you talking about? - We should make a definite move with our lives. I want us to get married. - Married? Don't you think it's too soon? - No, I don't. Three months, six months, it's not gonna make a difference to anybody. - Richard. - Isabelle, my whole life I've been waiting. Waiting to get out of the Navy, waiting to start my own business, waiting for the right woman. Well, I've met her and I'm in love with her and I don't want to wait any longer. - I just don't think it's necessary. - Well, it's not a matter of what's necessary. We're in love with each other, aren't we? Isabelle? - If I agree to marry you, will you promise never to doubt my love for you again? (deep sigh) - Yes, I promise. - Well then yes. I'll marry you. - Everything's working out perfectly. (phone rings) - Homicide. - [Woman] May I speak to Detective Beers? - You got him. - This is Isabelle Collins. I finally found the strength to go through my husband's belongings and I found something I thought you should know about. - [Beers] What's that? - My husband's watch is missing. He wore it every day. - What kind of watch was it? - A Rolex President, solid gold. I don't know if he registered it. - [Beers] It sounds expensive. - I'm not sure of the exact value. I guess somewhere around ten thousand. And I found something. A registration number: J95723. Is this helpful detective? - It could be. - Please call me immediately if it leads to anything. - [Beers] You'll be the first to know. - Thank you, detective. - What's up Lenny? - Let's say you got a hold of a $10,000 watch. What's the first thing you're gonna do? - I'm gonna drop to my knees and thank Saint Jude. - But you stole it. - I'm gonna lie low until things cool down. - And? - And I'm gonna call on the pawn shops and dealers in the area. - This is the one. Ruby, what do you think? - Get that one, mommy. - It's beautiful. It's gorgeous, we'll take it. - Richard. This is a $20,000 ring. - So? I want you to have the best. - You sure? - Sweetheart, this is not a problem. In a few days, everything that's mine will be yours anyway. - Sure thing. It'll be here waiting for you. But you're gonna have to come down and pick it up yourself. No, no, no problem. Uh huh. And give my love to Sarah. - Okay. Let's go Jr. - What's going on? - We just got lucky. (scoffs) - It's worth twice that. - Not to me. - All right, okay, okay. - Just give me a couple of minutes to write up, I'll get you the cash. - Just hurry it up, okay? - Young people are so testy these days. - Oh, please. - Guy in a reddish shirt. Around the corner. (exhales) - [Beers] Police! Hey! Go get him. (exciting music) (fire alarm blaring) Don't move. - [Nelson] Stay where you are. If you don't move you don't get hurt. - I'm not moving. - [Nelson] If you don't move you don't get hurt. - Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the presence of God to witness and bless the joining together of this man and this woman in holy matrimony. - Right now ballistics is testing your gun against the bullet we pulled out of Stewart Collins' head. If it's a match, or should I say when it's a match, your ass is going down. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You got one choice left to you. How much time you do. Keep your mouth shut you do life. Tell us who hired you maybe we can swing a deal. - Hired? How do you know I was hired? - Because a jerk like you can't even find Stewart Collins' part of town without someone leading the way. (chuckles) - Richard, do you take Isabelle to be your lawfully wedded wife? In sickness and in health so long as you both shall live? - I do. - So what kind of a deal are we talking about? - That's the DA's call. - Nah, DA goes with the cop's recommendation, you know that. - Isabelle, do you take Richard to love and honor from this day forth, forsaking all others? In sickness and in health so long as you both shall live? - I do. - In a situation like this, the best they'll do is man-1. - Man-1? That's for 25, you're out of your mind. No way, no deal, forget it. - Would you prefer a permanent address on death row? - Is there anyone here who knows any reason why these two people should not be joined in holy matrimony? If there is, let him speak now or forever hold his peace. - [Doggett] I told you, I do not know his name. - Okay, okay, how'd the guy find you? - He picked me up. When I come out of prison he was just there. He just picked me up in his car. - What kind of car? - A white car. - Come on Doggett, think. What kind of car? - One thing I can say definitely, it was a rental car. - What makes you say that? - Because it had that thingamajiggy on the rear view. You know, like when they finish working on it? - Yeah. The guy that hired you, what did he look like? - I don't know. - What did he look like? - See, he was wearing sunglasses. - Come on, Doggett. You can do better than that. - Let me show you the family photo album, maybe this will refresh your memory. (soft music) - [Richard] With this ring, I thee wed. - [Doggett] That's him. - You sure? - Yeah. Positive. - Let's go. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - With this ring, I thee wed. - By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. (soft music) - [Woman] Congratulations. (cheering) (exciting music) - [Beers] Richard Davis. - Yes? - What is this? Is something wrong? - [Beers] You're under arrest for the murder of Stewart Collins. - What? - [Beers] You have the right to remain silent. - [Richard] What are you talking about? - [Beers] Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. - [Richard] This is ridiculous. - [Isabelle] Oh my God. - [Beers] You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney. - Richard. - [Richard] Can I have an explanation for this please? - The court will appoint one for you. - [Isabelle] Richard. - [Beers] Do you understand your rights? - Richard. - I just want to make sure I'm clear on this. The man you want me to defend, the police's number one suspect for instigating your husband's murder is the man you're now married to? - [Isabelle] That's correct. - And the judge won't grant him bail because he's considered a flight risk? - Correct again. - Well, I'm deeply flattered you think I'm the right attorney for the job. - I've done my homework. Your reputation is impressive. - Which part of it? - The part where you put your clients on the stand and they convince the jury that they're innocent. - That's a risky tactic. It can backfire if the attorney fails to efficiently prepare his client. - The DA has made a deal with the man who shot Stewart. He will testify that Richard hired him. - Well, if he's an ex-con like you said, I can tear his testimony to shreds. - I hope so. But if not, Richard's only chance may be to take the stand. With your help, he can stand the DA's cross examination. - You seem to know quite a bit about the law. - No. I just know a lot about you. You and my husband of course will have to come to this decision together. - A trial like this is gonna be expensive. - Money's no problem. I like to consider myself a woman of unlimited resources. - [Harold] We have a buyer interested in those properties we were discussing. - Oh, Harold, that's wonderful. Will we have an answer soon? - [Harold] I think so but these things take time. - I'm sorry, I'm sure you think I'm just a hysterical woman. - Not at all. You've been under enormous stress. I don't want you to worry. Just let me take care of everything. - Oh, Harold. It is so comforting to have someone like you I can trust. Thank you. - Mommy. - Yes, sweetheart. - Is Richard ever coming back? - Oh, honey. Come here. We have to be prepared for anything, all right? And you just remember. No matter what happens, you always have me and I always have you. - We'll plead not guilty and watch the state try to prove their case. - Kevin Doggett is a lowlife ex-con. - He says you were waiting for him when he stepped out of the prison gate. - Well, he can say whatever he wants. - But you were up in that area? - I was checking out some real estate. - I called the real estate agent you said you went up to see. - Look, I made an appointment with him to check out some property. I meant to see him. When I got up there I figured I'd get a better lay of the land if I drove myself around. I ended up getting lost, I forgot to call the real estate guy to cancel. I'm innocent. I barely knew Stewart Collins. - You ended up marrying his wife. - Is that a crime? - [Kendrick] To some juries. - Then pick one that you can convince. - I'm on your side. - My wife told me that you made a reputation for yourself by putting your clients on the witness stand. - Yes, and that's exactly what I'm gonna do with you. - It seems a little risky to me. I mean, a good prosecutor can make even an innocent man look guilty. - In my opinion, you don't have much choice. - [Woman] Here she comes. - [Reporter] Mrs. Davis, can we get a statement from you? Do you have any comments on the proceedings so far? Do you think that the final outcome will be a positive one? - Mr. Doggett, I want to make sure we understand your role here today. You are the man who killed Stewart Collins is that correct? - Objection, your honor, the witness has already admitted to... - Overruled. - Once again, Mr. Doggett, did you shoot Stewart Collins in the back of the head with a .38 caliber pistol? - Yeah. - Mr. Doggett, did you steal the victim's Rolex watch? - Yeah. - So you sneaked into the victim's home, you stole from him, and then you shot him. And then after you were caught you accuse my client of masterminding the entire crime. - Objection. Is there a question? - Sustained. Counselor. - Mr. Doggett, in exchange for identifying my client as the man who hired you, were you offered a manslaughter plea? - Yeah. - No further questions. (siren wailing in distance) (peculiar music) - Richard asked me to bring him his blue suit for his testimony tomorrow. What do you think? - That'll be fine. Don't worry. - I never do. - So, is there anything else I can do for you? - I thought a good lawyer knew the answer to every question before he asked it. You're a good lawyer aren't you? - I'm very good. - You made Doggett look very bad today. - I know how to do my job. - I'm sure you do. (door buzzes) - What do you want? - Relax, sit down. This is completely off the record. - Uh huh, I don't have anything to say. - Tomorrow's your big day on the stand, huh? Here. - No. - Sugarless. New bridgework so I gotta chew a special brand that doesn't stick. - Let me get this straight. You tell me about your dental work and now supposedly we're such good buddies that I can't help but confess to murdering Stewart Collins? - Mr. Davis, I don't think you're guilty. - So that's why I'm locked up and standing trial. - I want you to listen very carefully, your life may depend on it. I'm not after you, I don't want you. I want your wife. - I think you're a little confused. - If you tell us everything and testify against her, I can get the DA to make a deal with you. - Listen to me. Neither Isabelle nor I had anything to do with murdering Collins. Guard. I don't have anything else to say to you. - Then good luck tomorrow. - Mr. Davis, you gave a very convincing performance on that stand today. I would say your attorney rehearsed you well. - Objection. - Does counsel have a question? - Oh, yes your honor, I do. As part of your testimony today, you've already admitted to having traveled to the vicinity of Isley State Prison and rented a car three days before Stewart Collins' murder. Is that correct? - Yes, I think I've explained that I was exploring some real estate opportunities. - And how do you explain the fact that a guard at Isley State Prison testified that he saw a man matching your description speaking to Kevin Doggett on the day of his release? - The guard was mistaken. - Mistaken? - Yes, mistaken. - So you expect this jury to believe that on that day there was another man who looked exactly like you and who was driving a car of the same make and color you rented? - Look, whoever that guard saw, it wasn't me. - Interesting. That's interesting. Mr. Davis, in your business dealings, do you ever have occasion to have cash transactions? - Yes, I do. - And how much cash would you ordinarily have on hand? - I don't know, it varies from time to time. - Would you ever have kept as much as $15,000 in your safe? - Objection, your honor, where is this going? - Sustained, get on with it counselor. - Mr. Davis, isn't it true that you paid Kevin Doggett $15,000 cash to kill Stewart Collins? - No, I don't even know this Doggett guy, I've never met him. - Let's move on. Mr. Davis, your father was a plumber, was he not? - Objection. Relevance. - The defendant's life attitudes, disposition, and character all go to motive, your honor. - I'll admit that but please don't belabor the point. Proceed. - Plumbing, did you ever work with your father? - Yeah, from the time I could walk I'd go out on jobs with him. - Okay, let's flash forward 20 odd years and the plumber's son has been to college, served in the Navy, and now sells yachts and sailboats. Is it important in your business to socialize with people who can afford such expensive luxury items? - It can't hurt. - And when you contemplated marrying the victim's wife did you imagine that your social status in this city would rise a few notches? - When I married Isabelle, we married because we were in love. - But once you were married, you did expect to find yourself accepted in a wider, should I say, more elevated social circle? - Look, I'm not a snob. Mansion or shack, I don't care where you live. I don't care how much money you make. - Did you ever tell your clients to whom you sold yachts that you used to fix toilets? - No, why should I tell them that? - So you were ashamed of your past? - No, I am not ashamed. - Well, at any time before you and your wife were a couple, did you ever feel that other people judged you? - Yes, sometimes. - And you resented it? - Well, who wouldn't? Look, I have spent my whole life working myself up. I have earned everything I have ever gotten. I deserve respect. - You deserve Isabelle Collins. - You're damn right I do. (crowd murmuring) - No further questions. - You can step down Mr. Davis. ♪ Fell so deep in love it must have been for sure ♪ ♪ Where no man in love had gone before ♪ - [Kendrick] The DA took Richard for quite a ride today. - What do you think is gonna happen? - That's in the jury's hands now. There's nothing we can do but relax. - No problem, counselor. ♪ To know you won't be there ♪ Is more than I can bear ♪ How could love be so unfair (anxious music) - [Judge] The defendant will stand. - We the jury in above entitled action find the defendant Richard Davis guilty of murder in first degree. (pounding gavel) - [Isabelle] Richard. - [Judge] Order. - [Richard] It's over. - There's still grounds for appeal. - It's not gonna matter. - I'll never give up Richard. - You can get to the parking lot down those stairs. - [Reporters] Mr. Kendrick. - [Kendrick] One at a time. - [Reporters] Mr. Kendrick. - [Kendrick] I don't think it had anything to do with. - [Beers] Mrs. Davis. - I'm sorry detective, I have to get home to my daughter. I can't answer any more questions. - I just have one. I was wondering if you feel any sense of responsibility for what you've done? - Excuse me? - You're gonna let Richard Davis go to prison for the rest of his life. I was wondering how you feel about that? - How dare you talk to me like that? My first husband was brutally murdered. Now, Richard Davis has been wrongfully convicted of that heinous crime. Do you have any idea what that does to my daughter? - Save it for someone who cares. I'm coming for you. It's just a matter of time. - I was stunned by the verdict. The state clearly did not prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. - Your client's testimony impacted the jury's decision. Why did you allow him to take the stand? - Because he's innocent and the innocent have the right to publicly clear their name. I'm confident the appeal at court will reverse the verdict. That's all for now. (reporters overlapping questions) So, how do you think I looked? - Handsome. Trustworthy. Yes, even sexy. - You always say the right thing. - You always inspire me. - What? - He's been convicted but there's sentencing. - There's only one sentence the judge can hand down and that's life without the possibility of parole. - Do you think Richard will make some deal? - He doesn't have anything the DA wants. Does he? - No. - Look Isabelle, if you have something to confess, tell your priest. Not me. (knocking) - Oh sweetheart, come in. What's wrong? - I had a bad dream. - Oh honey, okay. I'll get you a glass of water. - I'm sorry you had a nightmare. - Are you gonna be my new daddy? - No. - Here sweetheart, you take this and get back into bed okay? I'll be there in a minute. Darling, you could have been a little more diplomatic. She's only 10 years old. - I'm sorry. She caught me off guard. - And I didn't think that anything could catch the great Gavin Kendrick off guard. - Now you know my big secret. I don't like kids and kids don't like me. In fact, I don't even think I liked myself when I was a kid. - But I bet that you were so cute. - As a matter of fact, I was pretty adorable. - You know, I bet if you spent a little more time with Ruby you two would really hit it off. I think she would charm her way right into your heart. - Like her mother? - Who knows? You may discover that in fact you and kids are... Very compatible. - You never give up do you? - It's what you love about me. - Look, face facts. We got him, we didn't get her. - Whoa, whoa, it's not over yet. - I tried to set up another meeting with Davis, he refused, he won't talk to me. - Maybe after sentencing when he hears he's doing life he'll feel a bit more like chatting. - Nah, this guy fell hard for her. We can't go back to him unless we have some proof of her gameplan. - Then we are out of luck. - Wait a minute. Let me ask you something. This lady's m.o. is about getting men to do her dirty work right? Who's to say Richard Davis is the only one? - Who else are we talking about? - I'm not sure but I'd like to put a surveillance team on her. - No, no, no, we tried that months ago. Right after her husband's funeral. Came up with zip. - Yeah, she was on her guard then. Right now she might be feeling pretty confident. - You get cocky, you start making mistakes. - Okay. I'll see about getting a court order. But it's only gonna be for 48 hours. - Thanks Maggie. - Excuse me sweetheart, I'm late for court. - Here mom. - Oh, thank you. Hmn, that's an excellent choice, sweetheart. - The murder of Stewart Collins was a particularly cold, premeditated crime. The law states clearly that the defendant's participation in the murder is tantamount to having pulled the trigger. Richard Davis, it is the judgment of this court that you be remanded to Isley State Prison and that you remain there for the rest of your natural life without the possibility of parole. (pounds gavel) (crowd murmuring) - I want you to listen to me very carefully. You trust me don't you? - Of course I do. - It's over, it's done. - What are you talking about? We'll appeal. - We can appeal all we want. It can take years. The sooner that we accept this, the sooner that you can have your life. - Don't, Richard, don't say that. I need you. - This is the only chance for you and Ruby to have a life together. - No, Richard, no. - I want you to get a divorce. Promise me. - [Guard] Mr. Davis. - Please promise me. (peculiar music) - No, no, sweetheart. A dress like this will look much more becoming if you walk slowly. Stand up straight. (doorbell rings) Keep practicing. Harold, I was expecting you. - Great news. I called in a few favors and the deal finally went through. I wanted to bring the check over myself. - How considerate of you. I'm sorry, I can't ask you in. My daughter's come down with the flu. In fact, I should probably be getting back to her now. - Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Well, let me give you the check. And all I need is your signature and I'll be out of your way. - If Ruby weren't so ill I'd invite you in. - We'll just have to make it another time. - I'd like that more than you can imagine. (sighs) Santa came early this year. - What did he bring me? - Us honey, us. He brought us a big pile of money. - And that's really good huh? - When you have a lot of money you can buy any toy you want. Oh now, that's it. Now you'll turn heads. - [Beers] Has she moved yet? - Yeah, she's moved all right. She turned a page. The best thing we can hope for is if she goes skinny dipping before the court order expires. - Yeah, this babe's got too much time on her hands. I think our luck just changed, come on. - [Nelson] What? - Let me in there. - What is it, Lenny? - [Beers] Oh yeah, keep coming. - Let me take a look. - [Beers] No, you're too young for this Nelson. (Nelson chuckling) Oh, look at this. Oh, beauty. I don't believe this woman. Now she's doing the lawyer. Oh, she's good. - That's enough. Enough. - Don't you have anything to say? - What? Now that I've seen your sleazy tape I'm supposed to have a nervous breakdown and spontaneously blurt out that Isabelle killed Collins? I don't think so. - It was a setup all along. - How do you figure that? - Your wife's sleeping with your lawyer. Open your eyes. She's been working you from day one. - She used you to get rid of her husband. Now there she is in the arms of her new boyfriend. You're about to go upstate for the rest of your life. - You've been had. - You need to think real hard about this. You need to decide whether your life is less important than Isabelle Collins. Because that's what it comes down to. - All right, I want to see her. I want a conjugal visit. - Ha, great, one for the road? - I would like to see her by myself. To find out what happened. - Okay, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll swing the conjugal. But only if you agree to having the room bugged. - No. - It's the only way I'll get it approved. We need to hear what she has to say for herself too. - Okay. (door buzzes) (subdued music) (door buzzes) - [Man] Paging all personnel. - Richard. What's wrong? - I know about you and Kendrick. Please don't insult my intelligence by denying it. The police have had you under surveillance. - What? - Hidden camera. They have a tape. I saw a tape of the two of you together. - Let's see her try wiggling out of this. - I wanted you to have the best attorney. - So you had to sleep with him? - I didn't feel that I had any other choice. - Why? Did he force you? - No. - Did he make some kind of ultimatum? - No. - Well then what? - Without you I felt so confused. I was so vulnerable. I was afraid that he wouldn't do his best to get you off. I was such a fool, Richard. I feel so ashamed. Richard please don't hate me. I did it for you. For us. - Us? I'm the one that's locked up. - I'll get you another lawyer. We'll appeal. - Okay. I think I can get another trial if you agree to testify against Kendrick. Tell the court everything that happened. - That a boy. - But would they believe me? - Why not? I did. You can be very persuasive when you want something, Isabelle. - You're scaring me, Richard. - Well, I don't think anything really scares you. - Losing you terrifies me. - I just want to go back and change things before everything all started. Before we went looking for somebody to kill Stewart. - Richard what are you talking about? - Well, I've had a lot of time to think since I've been in here. Everything's just been going around and around in my head. Wondering about us and Stewart, everything you told me. Every tiny little detail that led up to hiring Doggett. - What are you talking about? - What do you mean what am I talking about? You don't remember telling me how violent Stewart was? And how afraid you were? - What? - And how when the brakes went out in your car how we were convinced that Stewart was trying to kill you. - Richard... - And how we made sure to have alibis on the day that Stewart was murdered. - Richard, stop it. What's wrong with you? - [Richard] Why are you denying this? - Because it's not true. And you are scaring me, Richard. I don't understand. I have to leave. - You had this planned from the beginning didn't you? You just figured that I was so much in love with you that I would do anything to hang on. - Richard, I don't know what's happened to you, but I have got to go. - Stop her you bastard. - Nothing. You got nothing. (door buzzes) (fast paced music) - Yes, could you get the number please of the state bar association? Would you be a dear, would you dial it for me? Yes, I'd like to report a case of professional misconduct. The attorney's name is Gavin Kendrick. Is everything all right? - Application, birth certificates, fine. But I'm gonna need a photo ID Mrs. Hamilton. - Yes, of course. I'm usually a lot more photogenic. - Well, all I need now is to see your airline ticket. - Excuse me? - Two day passports are only issued with proof of travel plans. - Oh, I'm so stupid. I didn't know. I don't suppose that you can make an exception. - I'm afraid that's not possible. - Ruby, honey. I don't know what we're gonna do. I'm afraid we can't go on this vacation. - Listen lady, I'm sorry. - I know that we should have applied sooner but this trip wasn't anticipated. Her father passed away recently. It's okay sweetheart. I just thought some time away would be good for her. (sighs) Thank you. You're a saint. - What do you want from me? - I can help you. We can help each other. - Yeah? Well, I think I'm gonna pass on your kind of help. - Just listen to me for a moment. Isabelle worked the both of us. From the very beginning. - Go to hell. - Richard, Isabelle used you. - She used me? You used me. You slept with my wife. - Yeah. And now I'm paying for it. She's on me up before the bar association on sexual misconduct charges. (laughs) - Oh, that is sweet. - At least I'm trying to fight the charges. I'm trying to help myself. You're just sitting here doing nothing. - [Richard] Guard. - Richard, wait. Just hear me out. What have you got to lose? - Why should I listen to a single word that comes out of your mouth? - Just look at the facts. Stewart's dead, you're locked up, and I'm facing disbarment. And what about Isabelle? She's got everything. Stewart's estate, your assets, her freedom. Her every move was calculated from the start. - What do you want from me? - A trade. You testify for me, I'll testify for you. - What are you gonna say? - Everything she told me. How she hired some detective to pretend she was being followed. How she manipulated you. How she hired some grease monkey to show her how to sabotage her brakes. Look, if you try to make a deal with the DA right now it's your word against hers. But with my testimony, you'll have some leverage. - [Isabelle] So, what do you think? - I see no reason why we can't proceed. - Good. I'll be right back, honey. - My client and I have given this a lot of thought. And a Mr. Davis' new attorney, I've advised him not to say word one until the deal's been okayed by your boss. - Hot off the laser printer. He cooperates completely with us, answering all our questions about Isabelle Davis' involvement in Stewart Collins' murder, in exchange he gets man-1. He'll be out in eight years. Good enough? - [Beers] Nelson. - What? - Davis is on the hot seat. - No kidding. - Take it with you. - Your honor, it's clear that Isabelle Collins Davis conspired with my client lying to him... - I'm capable of connecting all the dots counselor. Mr. Davis, was it her idea to have Stewart Collins murdered? - No, not exactly. - But she did manipulate my client. - Can you testify under oath that she encouraged you to hire the killer? - No, not really. - Did she help you plot out the details? - I kept the details to myself. - [Nelson] Lenny, I don't get this letter. - [Beers] Wipe your mouth. - I mean, why set up the second husband? She had more than enough money, right? - I have a theory. - You want to share that? - [Beers] Did you ever hear the story of the scorpion and the turtle? - This is all very interesting but there's not much to link Mrs. Davis directly to the crime. - The people believe that with Mr. Davis' and Mr. Kendrick's testimony a conviction is possible. I'd like to put the facts before a jury. Let them decide for themselves. - Very well. What took you so long to tell us all this? - I was in love with her. - The scorpion wants to get across the river, right? So he asks this turtle for a ride on his back. The turtle's smart. He says, hey, if I give you a lift, you're gonna sting me. No, I wouldn't do that, says the scorpion. If I did that we'd both drown. Okay, says the turtle, jump aboard. So now they're about halfway across the river and the damn scorpion stings the turtle. When they're both about to drown the turtle yells out, hey, what did you do that for? The scorpion shrugs and says, it's what I do. - We have the warrant, gentlemen. Arrest her. (suspenseful music) - [Man] Police. - [Nelson] Isabelle Davis. - [Man] Police. - [Nelson] Miss Davis? - [Man] Spread out guys. - [Officer] Yes, sir. - [Beers] Check out her bedroom. Damn it. - [Woman] Can I help you? - [Beers] Who are you? - Charlotte Callahan, real estate agent. - Well, we're looking for Isabelle Davis. - [Charlotte] She moved out yesterday. - That's just perfect. Where'd she go? - [Charlotte] Uh, to tell you the truth, I don't know, she didn't say. - Did she give you any hint? Did she go stay with relatives? Do you know anything? - No. We just bought this house from her and we intend to put it on the market later on this month. Would you happen to be detective Beers? - Yeah. - Well, Mrs. Davis asked me to give you a message. She said to thank you for helping her get everything she wanted. - She won. - What are you talking about Lenny? We can hand this over to the FBI. - It's over. The feds can look all they want. I'm willing to bet she's some place far away. Some place where english is a second language. - [Man] Let's go. (happy music) - Mommy, look what the man gave me? - Honey, which man? - Over there. Can I keep it? - No, sweetheart. You give this back to him and maybe he'll offer it to you again. After we've gotten to know each other. - When will that be? - Soon. - Hello, may I introduce myself? I'm Jean Claude Saint Laurent. - I'm Isabelle. (Jean speaks in foreign language) And you've already met my daughter Ruby. - I hope you don't mind me giving her a little gift. - It was very sweet of you. Would you care to join us? - Merci. I have to confess I had an ulterior motive. I wanted to meet you but I was too shy to speak to you. - Why were you shy? You're a very nice man. - Merci, Ruby. - Sweetheart, why don't you give Jean a thank you kiss. - Ruby, you're going to break a lot of hearts one of these days. - Oh yes, one of these days. (happy music) (instrumental music) (MultiCom Jingle)
