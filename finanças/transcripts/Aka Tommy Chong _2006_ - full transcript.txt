Is it workin'? My name is Tommy Chong. I'm a doper comedian, and I'm in here because I made a stupid joke about the bongs being the only weapons of mass destruction that the Bush administration had found. And the next thing I know I'm lookin' at nine months. It's locked, Man! What? Oh, yeah. Let go. Let go, Man. Go to, sss. Ooh, come on, come on in. Hey, what' goin' on Man? It's a bust Man. We gotta figure out some way to get you outta here, Man. Shit. Tonight one half of Cheech & Chong is in a whole lot of trouble. That's right, and you may have heard of Cheech & Chong, the comedy duo known for portraying marijuana in a favorable light. Tommy Chong's internet business might go up in smoke. Federal agents raided the actor comedian's online paraphernalia store. The US Attorney says Chong ran a family business called Nice Dreams Enterprises, named after one of his movies, and as the primary investor, the government says he sold more than $100,000 worth of autographed marijuana pipes and bongs Search and seizure operations involving approximately 2,000 federal, state, and local law enforcement operators are taking place at numerous locations across the country. They busted in the house and they kept sayin', "You're not under arrest, you're not under arrest." It was surreal. They came to the house, and they raided our house with a helicopter, 20 cops, 10 feds, I guess about 10 cops. Six o'clock in the morning, it was dark outside. Scared the shit out of us. Oh, Man, it's so fuckin' weird gettin' busted for bongs. They really got me by surprise with that one. Huh, you know, what's they do that for? When they raided my house, Man, I thought they were lookin' for dope, Man, I mean, you know, that. Then when he said, "Do you have any narcotics in your house?" Of course, I'm Tommy Chong, Man. They came to his house in a very nice residential suburb of Los Angeles with helicopters, with dogs, LAPD, DEA. You know, it looked like John Dillinger was being arrested. Rousted him out of his bed in the early morning hours to arrest him for his bong business. I don't know what they were looking for. I don't really know what they were looking for. I mean they found a pound of pot in our house, but, you know, when you tell people that, they go, "Wow, a pound." But you know what, if you're a pot smoker, a pound is not much. You have a pound of sugar in your house always. A pound of flour. What is a pound? It's nothing. And he said, "Any more?" And I said, well, there's some in the basement, and the guy kept running up and saying, "Can't find it." So I kind of insulted him. I think that's why I'm going to jail, 'cause I was, "What kind of fuckin' DEA guy are you?" Ya know? And he got defensive, he's, "Well, I don't have my dog." I went, "But you don't need a dog, "you need fuckin' eyes, Man." I'm all for it. I think as long as we're on Code Orange, and the attacks coming from not only Iraq, but North Korea, are imminent, the best we could do is bust Tommy Chong. I mean, you realize that we literally have busted Cheech & Chong. Cheech & Chong were a phenomenon of the counterculture, and because they outlasted most acts from the 1960s, almost came to define the era. Through the 1970s and early '80s, the vato lowrider and the Mongolian hippy freak biker became the last of the anti-establishment Mohicans, subverting, questioning, and mocking authority in their pursuit of righteous happiness in the very best buds. We've always been into drugs somewhere along the line. You know everything, you know. You have to speak about what you know, you know. One thing we've never been is like an ex-drug user. Haven't been that yet. We haven't reached that stage yet, you know. Tommy Chong and I met in Vancouver, Canada, in 1969. I was delivering carpets at the time and he was runnin' an improvisational theater company, and then a topless nightclub that his family owned. We moved up to Vancouver, Because Tommy had had those nightclubs, and went to take the clubs over, and he started an improv group. Whoa. We went looking for actors, and somebody told him about this funny guy. That's when we met Cheech. Where did you two meet? I was delivering carpets, actually, and I got introduced to Tommy through a friend who was an editor of a rock and roll magazine. So he offered me $5 a week more to hang out with naked girls and get high all night than delivering carpets. So I thought about it. Well, let's see the girls, you know. Shanghai Junk, where we performed, was Vancouver's first topless bar. They wore pasties and everything, G-strings. What it turned out to be at the end was hippy burlesque. Informed with a hippy ethic, you know, peace, love, dope. With naked. I'd seen, like, Second City and The Committee, and people like that, so I just thought it'd be a good idea, if I could get the girls doing skits. I had a lot of my hippy friends, long hairs, and topless girls, and Cheech came around. All the other people in the group wanted to go up north and get their head together. They felt this was not cool makin' money, and it wasn't the hip thing to do. So Cheech said, "You know, Man, I'll go down to LA with you. "I'm into makin' money. "I'm into becomin' a star." The group broke up and Cheech and I just stayed together, came down to LA. The audience was that stoner kind of audience, so then we started doin' characters based on our audience. Oh, oh, hey, Man, the cops are behind us. No, don't turn around, Man, just sit there and act natural. Oh, Man, I want you to get rid of this stuff, okay? I'm gettin' rid of it, Man. No, Man, not that way. Eat it, Man. Oh, Man, I can't eat, I got a whole pocketful, Man. They're right behind us. When I saw them, I though, these guys are unique. These guys are really funny. With music or comedy it's always, is it funny, or is it good? It doesn't matter what it is. They were one of the few acts that was really appealing to not the typical kids, but the rock and roll kids. They were one of the leaders of the counterculture movement. Who is it? It's me, Dave. Open up, Man, I got the stuff. Who is it? It's me, Dave, Man. Open up, I got the stuff. I didn't. Who? It's Dave, Man, open up. I think the cops saw me come in here. Who is it? It's, it's Dave, Man, will you open up? I got the stuff with me. Who? Dave, Man, open up. Dave? Yeah, Dave. Come on, Man, open up, I think the cops saw me. Dave's not here! What made me think I could put that on record? I don't know, but, you know, it stuck with me immediately, and the people and A&M and my attorney thought I was pretty much crazy. When you have such a huge culture that doesn't have anything, they don't have a spokesman, they don't have someone singing about their culture, they don't have someone making jokes about their culture, if you can open that door and get to those people, it's a huge audience, and that's why we were selling millions of albums. Do you think it might be a bit of an in joke? I mean, your humor is almost completely based on dope. Well, dope and sex, and if you can't relate to that, forget it. Yeah, right. I mean, other than that get into religion, you know, I... We broke through with material that before that just wasn't happening. It wasn't being played, it wasn't being exposed in any way. We called it hard rock comedy. What actually is the difference of being hard rock funnymen. Has it got to do with, you know, um, drugs? Hard rock is, when, like, if I tell you a joke, and you don't laugh, I punch your face in. Oh, it's like that, is it? Um, what barnyard animal do you most identify with? Bachelor number three. Just a minute, I think I can answer that for bachelor number three. I would say you're a pig. Talk to me like that, Shithead! You're a big pig to me! For mate number three. Eventually we got play and they did TV shows that we never thought in the beginning that they would be asked to do. There are some people who might question whether or not your material was off color. The good thing about our stuff is you can take it both ways. You can? Either you get it or you don't. They were funny. They understood their audience. They understood the people who did like them, what they felt was funny. And they entertained them. I mean, that's, we're in in the entertainment business. That's what we did. Now if you want to go back and say it was really a political statement, I don't know. What do you like so much about drugs. Drugs? I don't know, you have a lot of fun. You get high and laugh at nothing. That's what Cheech & Chong are. You get high and you laugh at us. It doesn't take a lot of brains. Hey, Man. What? Hey, what was in this shit, Man? Mostly Maui Wowie, Man. Yeah? But it's got some Labrador in it. What's Labrador? It's dog shit. What? Yeah, my dog ate my stash, Man. I had it on the table and the little motherfucker ate it, Man. Yeah? So I had to follow him around with a little baggie for three days before I got it back. You mean we're smokin' dog shit, Man? So they did Up In Smoke and it became a big hit. I meant that was a shock to everybody, a shock, because nobody thought that little movie was gonna be a hit. It was so cool, it was so cool. Well, it wasn't Martin and Lewis, and that was many years ago. Before that there was Abbott and Costello. Before that there was Laurel and Hardy today there is only Cheech & Chong. You said you don't wanna hurt anybody, but there are some people that say that by doing dope in the movies, and these kids come to the movies, and they see you doing that, you're hurting those kids. Only if you take their position that drugs are bad. And we take the position that drugs, some drugs, are not only are harmless, but are good for you. We're not the cause. We're only doin' what's out there now, popular. There are a lot comedians who make fun of alcohol, like Red Skelton who did amazing routines around alcoholism, and they were hilarious. And Tommy does those kinda routines around marijuana abuse. The side of marijuana, of people that are too high at the wrong times, that kind of lose their perspective, because they're too high. They were right on. There's a comic aspect to that, and they exposed it for the first time. But the media was happy to have that, because that became an over all cliche for everybody. Well, when you're struggling as a comedian, it's like a drowning man reaching for a straw, you know, or anything. You just try stuff until you find something that works. And what I mean by works, it's like, whoa, you get an effect from an audience. You know, they sit up, and they're listening, and they're asking, "Where are you performing next?" We're in... Is it Kogen or Muskegon? Muskegon. Muskegon. That's funny, you missed it. It said, instead of skis, it's crutches for sale. Oh, Jesus... Oh, my God. Is this your weekly paper, or? "Chong's lone stipulation was that we do not "discuss his current legal problem. "Somehow the occasional reference to them "snuck into our conversation anyway." There's another beat. "Underscoring the stage and screen persona "differs from the man himself, "Chong never once said man." Chong never once said man. Tommy was on the road doing standup, and he got very lonely, because he didn't have Cheech, so he asked me if I'd like to come on the road with him. Well, I said, I would if I could be in the show. So he said, okay, starting. You can start just doing the intro. You know, the thing is, Tommy had me convinced that pot was legal. He had it growing on the roof of the house. We were selling little bongs after the show. So after this incident I realized, I fucked up. I shoulda married Cheech. So now let's bring up the biggest stoner of them all, the Maharishi of Marijuana, the King of Dope, the one, the only Mr. Tommy Chong! So it's nice being out in the free world. Fuck me, Man. I thought if I'm gonna get popped, it'd be for pot. My bong? Sorry. Apparently they had been following Tommy for the last year. And because we had this Chong Glass business, there is a law in the books, "Selling paraphernalia is illegal." In two states, Iowa and Pennsylvania, I think it is. Here we are at a time in our history when there's really, almost unparalleled assaults on our safety by international terrorists, and you've got John Ashcroft who's trying to promote his moral vision of America, and it started by draping the boobs on the statues in the Department of Justice. The illegal drug trade is a billion dollar illegal industry targeted on exploiting human weaknesses in order to reap billions of dollars in illegal profits. However, it's not only the sellers of the drugs themselves that are profiting from the drug trade. There's another illegal industry that is integrally linked to the drug trade. It's the drug paraphernalia business. On February 24, 2003, the Justice Department called a press conference to announce the culmination of a year-long, undercover sting operation code named Operation Pipe Dreams. The national sweep was instigated by an obscure US Attorney from the western district of Pennsylvania, named Mary Beth Buchanan. But just to give you a description of how this would be used, the illegal drugs would be inserted, for example, into this area. Mary Beth Buchanan grew up in Roscoe, Pennsylvania, a small, all white town 30 miles south of Pittsburgh with a population of just under 900. In her high school yearbook she said her favorite hangout was Pizza Hut, and that when she went to college she planned on majoring in accounting. After getting her law degree from the University of Pennsylvania, Mary Beth Buchanan became a Pennsylvania State District Attorney. Then on September 11, 2001, United Airlines flight 93 crashed 60 miles southeast of Pittsburgh inside Mary Beth's jurisdiction. Her involvement in 9/11 catapulted her to prominence within the law enforcement community. Three days later Mary Beth Buchanan was the first woman, and the youngest person in Pennsylvania history, every to be named US Attorney. For her first major operation Mary Beth named Tommy Chong her number one target, because Tommy Chong's entertainment career glamorized the use of marijuana. Hi, I'm Paris Chong. I'm the oldest son of Tommy Chong. I've got him right here. He's gonna be on my shoulder today. We're here at Chong Glass, which is a family business. We specialize in hand-blown glass tobacco pipes and water pipes that are over 18. What was that? No, we can't say, it's illegal to say that on video. Stop it, Dad! We had a license. We were being audited by the United States Government. We were actually turning the business around. It was gettin' pretty good. Did he have much to do with the day to day operations at the factory? No, I mean, his ideas are so way out, so creative, that it really interfered and kinda was conflicting to any kind of manufacturing or business where there's serious budget constraints. He wanted to make a million dollar bong. Have it gold-plated, diamonds on it, and he wanted to have it for, I mean, this, I'm serious. To this day he probably still thinks it's a great idea. He wanted to display it and have it, and he believed that there was a market for a million dollar bong. When we first started, we were told not to sell to Pennsylvania, Idaho, and I think two more states. I don't remember which ones they were. I remember writing orders for states, you know, like, going, like all fired up. And then going, wait a second, after I'm getting their information, wait, where are you? You know, and like, oh, I'm sorry, we can't sell to your state. One guy kept calling me from Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, and I told him we couldn't sell in his state. So he kept calling me back. Thanks for holding. Yes, hello? Yeah, hi. Hey, how are ya? Good, how you doin'? They musta called 20 different times tryin' to contact us. They talked to Paris, and emails. In the conversations, it's like you can tell that it's, I'm saying no, and the guy's not listening. And then he would come back and go, oh, I talked to my lawyer, he said that's only in Pittsburgh. But in my county in Beaver Falls it's allowed. So came down to it where he decided that he was gonna show up at the warehouse and buy it, I believe he said, I'm gonna rent a Navigator, 'cause you know how I do it. And I was, like, okay, yeah, well, as long as you're comin' here. They bought everything that we didn't have in stock. So once we filled the order, then they were, like, oh, well, we're not in town, just ship it to us. We ended up just finally shipping it, 'cause it was just sitting there and it was on hand, and we were holding up other orders. So it was probably eight months, the whole thing. This could be it, Harry. Pass the word along. Tell the men it's time to shoot the moon. I couldn't believe the manpower that they had. There was nobody inside, and they stormtrooped the place. 45 agents. As soon as I opened up the door, they pushed me out of the way, and they ransacked the factory. Like, as if somebody was in there waiting to ambush 'em. Over glass. And it wasn't like anyone was really hiding anything, because everybody was listed with their address. We weren't like a garage operation. We were a company that paid taxes. All they had to do was pick up a phone, we woulda told 'em everything. Because we were wide open. But they wanted to make it look like a criminal enterprise. So they had to do the old raid in the morning. Once they got the one thing they needed, then that whole operation could go forward. We were the last straw. That was the last thing they needed. Throw Tommy in on top of the pile, and now it's on. It wouldn't even have made the news if they woulda went up to Oregon and shut people down. I was insignificant. I was, like, uh, you know, they asked me some questions. But really I was insignificant. It was like from the get go it was clear that they could care less about me. It was about my father and his celebrity. That's what it was about. Make bongs illegal. I know hippies will quit, like, left and right now. I'm just totally blown away, I can't smoke anymore. Can't get my bong. Truth is, you get a bud and no way to smoke it, you turn into McGuyver in a heartbeat. Took a little jar of pimentos. Punched a hole in the top. Put a French horn mouthpiece in it. Took my brother's Super Soaker, cut its hose, stuck that in there, went to my neighbor's house, asked my neighbor's mom for some Play Doh for a Sunday school project, plugged it up, went down to my buddy's house, and it was done. I think the easiest way is to grab an apple, and then you want to create an L. You find where the stem comes out, poke a pen, a Bic pen, that is, right down to the bottom. You want to burn it slow and lightly, and... You get the kind of a natural taste with it, kind of an apple scented weed, and it's straight. It works perfectly. Potatoes work too. You can take a Maglite and unscrew, and take the battery out to get rid of all the rubber. And they'll put a screen in there. I mean there's all kinds of ways you can actually ingest marijuana, but through a bong is a healthy way. Okay, again this is another item, the gas mask bong. Of course you would put the gas mask on your face and then ingest the marijuana. So you can have your hands free. The federal government to my knowledge has never emphasized head shop cases. This was the first major prosecuition that I can remember. So people tended to kind of ignore it. They sort of pulled something up out of the basement of federal law here and prosecuted Tommy Chong with that federal statute. This railroad train was headin' for the station. One of our problems in this case is that so many people told Tommy that nothing was gonna happen to him. We were afraid that it was. The government believes that the federal statute in this case prohibiting the sale and offering for sale of drug paraphernalia is absolutely clear. This woman in Pittsburgh. She was the national US Attorney in charge of the taskforce on drug paraphernalia. So we knew we had problems. She came into court personally, argued the sentencing. It was clear this thing was being done as a show trial, as a show case, for her to further her career, and for the Attorney General to further his career. They spent $12 million and utilized massive law enforcement resources to prosecute this bong case. It was a shock. In a last ditch effort to avoid serving actual prison time and stay at home under house arrest, Tommy made a public service announcement for the drug courts of America. Tommy's concept: Why smoke pot to get high, when you can get high naturally dancing salsa? Is this is a wide shot? Do you have a headband? Some Chong. Yeah. You wanna do some stuff with the Chong character talking about salsa. Mm, no. No? No, I think it had best be me. I actually think you should put some humor into some of this. Well, that's true. I do. Yeah, you're not funny, Man. You're not funny. But I don't think being that character is right. Well, you don't want that, because, you know, my humor in this situation is definitely not something you're gonna be able to show any drug court. You know? We'll try it one more time. Action. Uh, hey, Man, you know who I am, I'm Tommy Chong, Man. And I just gotta know one thing. Do you wanna get high? Cut, cut, cut. Now isn't it true that Tommy plea bargained and accepted a jail term, as I heard, correct me if I'm wrong, to save his wife and his child? Tommy determined from the outset that he was not going to contest the charges, if we could arrange a deal that would assure that neither his son nor his wife were charged. She said, lookit, we're thinking of prosecuting his son. We're thinking of prosecuting his wife. If your client takes the fall we won't prosecute them. So it's not really a deal. They didn't say, oh, yeah, you'll get house arrest, or you'll get this. It's, like, you don't know what you'll get. But we won't prosecute, your son and your wife won't get the same thing. So you have no choice. Almost all federal charges are settled by a plea bargain. The prosecutors have enormous, enormous power in seeking punishment in how to frame the charge, and can seek very, very long prison sentences. As a result there is enormous pressure on the defendant to plea bargain, and plead guilty, and get a reduced sentence. I mean, some of these sentences are just too long to serve. So what Tommy did, I don't know. Maybe he could've been found innocent in court, maybe not. But by going to court it would've been an enormous, enormous risk. The way it is now, this is a slam dunk for all the legal profession. The defense lawyers don't have a job. They just rubber stamp any, all they have to do is take the deal, whatever the deal's offered, to their client, and say, "Take the deal." If you don't take the deal, you're gonna go away to jail, because there's no way you're gonna win. I could speak for hours about how unfair the federal system is. It is run not by judges, it is run by prosecutors, and by our elected officials in Washington DC. It is a totally unfair system. I feel badly for anybody under federal indictment. Tommy got nine months. Of all 55 defendants, he was the only defedant with no priors to receive actual prison time. What we did was identify every distributor over the internet who supplied these products, and we charged every single one of them without exception. The sentence that But isn't it true that the 54 others Tommy Chong received... Got less than Tommy got. The Tommy got the most severe sentence of the 55? Of the 55 most defendants did receive a less, a far less sentence, however, there was someone who was prosecuted just two years ago who received a sentence of two years, so that's substantially more than the sentence that Tommy Chong received. Right, but your answer is that in Operation Pipe Dream he received the most severe sentence. So far, yes. Okay. Shel? Yeah? Forest is on the phone. Yeah, I got a phone call this mornin'. Mr. Chong, I'm a real big fan of yours, but, uh, you have to go to jail October the 8th, two o'clock at a place called Taft. He said it's somewhere in California. I don't know where that is, either, but it's somewhere in California. A big deal was made out of a couple of interviews that Tommy gave after the guilty plea. Tommy made some remarks which the judge and the prosecution interpreted as undercutting his plea, and his statements regarding his remorse. You know, I'm really not allowed to say anything. You think this is blown out of proportion? The charges speak for themselves, really. The government then pointed to an online chat session, sponsored by the Milwauke Journal Sentinel, where Tommy was asked, "What do you feel "about the feds cracking down on glass pipes and bongs?" And he replied, "I feel pretty sad. "But it seems to be the only "weapons of mass destruction they found this year." They argued that Tommy became wealthy by glamorizing the illegal distribution and use of marijuana and they cited his film, Up In Smoke, which they said trivialized law enforcement efforts to combat marijuana trafficking and use. Totally discounting the satirical nature of the film, and taking the position that this was somehow or other a serious slap at law enforcement. Okay, just be cool. How long you guys been in Mexico? A week. I mean, I didn't, a day. Which one is it, a week or a day? A weekday. You got any narcotics or marijuana in here? Uh, not anymore. Even in the transcripts they said that I'm in here because I did these movies. It says children are gonna be watching these for decades. I think this whole portion of the government's sentencing memorandum undercuts their statements to us that they were not seeking jail time for Tommy. They'll say to the judge, here is a man who has become wealthy thumbing his nose at marijuana enforcement efforts. The government could only have hoped in pointing that out to inflame the judge and send a message to the judge that here's a man who needs to be taught a lesson and should be incarcerated. That's my personal take on it. The government has admitted that part of the reason for the sentence was the exercise of his first amendment rights. That is making humorous films about drug use, which they claim encouraged people to use drugs, is a plain violation of the spirit of the first amendment. So you have an equal protection violation, a first amendment violation, and the needless misuse of criminal resources, when easily this could've been done in a civil manner. The idea that anyone would have to serve an extra day in prison because of a comedy routine involving Sergeant Stedenko, that's like the worst paranoid Cheech & Chong fantasy from the early '70s come true. Hey, Man, look, the house it being raided, Man. Get outta the house. Ig-pays, ig-pays, vamoose! Sounds very Latin. Could be the Mexican connection, better get this down. This is America. You get to criticize the government in this country. You get to say, I think these guys are ridiculous. It's guaranteed in the very first amendment to the constitution. It's what this country was founded on. You get to do that by being an American. And the fact that she brought up your movies? The fact that she brought up our movies means we don't want you to say whatever you want to say. This is not your America anymore, it's our America. And that's absolutely not the case. I think a joke we did on the Tonight Show, I said, you know, if Tommy had been a conservative radio talk show host instead of being in movies, he'd be in rehab. See, I think, if they wanna getcha, they getcha. One of the most emotional moments along the way for Tommy was when he realized the fight was over, he was going to prison, and there was nothing he could do about it. It was sobering. It was a sobering moment, because all the bullshit was over. There was no more pretending. There was no more, well, we can win this on appeal, or they can't do this to us, or, how could they, I'm just an actor. All of that was over. No, I was going to jail. Yeah, I wanna make a difference now. That's where life has been so perfect up to now. You know, really, perfect. Can you imagine I've made a living for years, 30 years, talkin' about a culture, and now I'm finally gonna have to stand up and be accounted for. It's just only right. I think when you look at the willingness to punish marijuana offenders this severely, take away their jobs, their cars, their houses, put them in prison for up to life without parole, it's not because of a small number of CIA people conspiring. It's because of something very deep in our culture that's willing to punish and destroy the people we don't like, and who don't fit, and who don't behave the way that we do. I grew up in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. My dad, full Chinese, Cantonese, and my mom was Scotch-Irish. They met in a park in Edmonton. It was pretty hairy in those days. I grew up knowing I was mixed. There was no doubt about it and I was definitely not invited into the White race. I remember a 10 year old, 11 year old girl having a birthday party on my block, and everybody got invited except me, because I was half Chinese, you know. The father did not want to mix, you know, have that little half breed boy there. And these were the people I played with every day. You know, that kinda thing. So growing up in that environment with all the rednecks, and that, we learned to fight. First thing that we did, my brother and I. Actually my brother, he was much better. He was older than me, so he had to clear the jungle. I always felt second class with white girls, especially the high class white girls. 'Cause they'd always be sneakin' around to see me. Or lying, you know, tell 'em I was Italian or something. And then when I started dating Black girls, it was like, wow, this is great, you know. I really became a black guy, Man, I did. Music, everything. I dressed, talked, tried to talk, but I wasn't very good at... ♪ Does your mama know about me ♪ Does she know ♪ Just what I am When I was in Motown, I played guitar in a band called Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers, and I wrote a song called Does Your Mama Know About Me. About a guy asking a woman if her mother knows that he's black, or in my case, Chinese. Even though Tommy created the Vancouvers he was fired from his own band, but around the same time a bass player named Ray Vaughan handed Tommy two things that would change his life forever: a Lenny Bruce comedy album and a marijuana cigarette. Lenny Bruce exposed the hypocrisy around marijuana and the laws against it, which had been steeped in racism, and used as a tool to keep minorities down. It was the jazz musicians who turned it into a sacrament, and passed its cultural use down to the beats and the hippies. So much of the war on marijuana is really a war on the '60s. It's a way of enforcing conformity on people. The pot laws have very little to do with this plant and everything to do with the people who smoked it. In the '60s marijuana was a symbol of rebellion, openly and defiantly a symbol of rebellion. Ah! Hey, that's the way to do it! Everybody was smoking pot. Your school teacher was smoking pot. You know, it's, like, it was a sacrament. So Tommy and Cheech & Chong were the voice of all those people, that emerging cultural front, that liked the effects of marijuana better than they liked the effects of nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol. It was a cultural divide. We had a huge spiritual awakening in the '60s, and they've spend the last 40 years trying to put the genie back in the bottle, and they've been very successful at it. America's public enemy number one in the United States is drug abuse. In order to fight and defeat this enemy it is necessary to wage a new, all out offensive. I think we're onto something really big, Harry. This could be the bust we've been waiting for. I told Peter Fonda this week, talked to him. We were actually going over this issue, and I said, they're out to get us, all of us. They're just startin' with Tommy. He goes, "You got that right," he said, "So we gotta stick together." And I said, and if they have their way, they will get all of us eventually... The catchphrase of the '70s, "Do your own thing," has been replaced in the '80s by, "Just say no." Just say no. Just say no. Just say no. I went to Overland in the '60s and graduated in '69 from Overland, so I'm well aware of the whole culture. Tommy Chong is a lot of things, but he's made his cause celebre drugs, and you gotta live your life way beyond that. We're past the '60s. What's really remarkable that under this drug czar, John Walters, John Ashcroft, the Attorney General of the Bush administration, they've really adopted a new focus in the drug war, and the new focus is marijuana. Marijuana is the cultural war for them. It's the way of taking the drug war to Middle America. There has been a culture in the United States in which entertainers have portrayed drug use as something that's acceptable and in fact desirable, and unfortunately our youth are influenced by those types of statements. Potheads are so easy, you know. I've known potheads to ask cops directions with a joint in their mouth. 'Scuse me, Officer, can you tell me... Never mind. It's not as if the Justice Department sent out a notice to all these people producing drug paraphernalia, and producing bongs and such, and said, we realize that this law has not been enforced by the federal government in recent years, but now we're gonna start to enforce it, so cease and desist from your manufacture. They didn't do that. There was no heads up, there was no notice, right. What they did was they raided people, they arrested people, middle of the night, humiliated them, seized their property, destroyed their property. This was all about politics. It was all about humiliation. That's what was going on. This was not about protecting the kids. This was not about any of that. Yesterday was September 11th, the day we were supposed to remember what was really important to us in America, and on that day, yesterday, Tommy Chong was sentenced to nine months in federal prison for selling bongs on the internet. Finally the terror alert can go back to green. Right after 9/11 Ashcroft said, we have to concentrate on a few things that we need to do most importantly. He made a very, very smart statement that he never lived up to, which was, look, now that we're confronted with this terrorist problem, we can't really do what we always did. I interpreted that to mean, you know, we can't fight the culture wars, we can't fight he drug wars, we can't fight the war on sex. We gotta fight the terrorists. We can't divert our manpower. Well, obviously that went out the window, because I can't think of a more ridiculous diversion of manpower than to bust Tommy Chong. If anyone feels safer because Tommy was put in jail, that's a ridiculous human being. They're just tearing this whole constitution apart. They're tearing freedoms apart. Then the 9/11 hit, and then that gave them the carte blanche. Now they can do a Patriot Act on everybody. We've got a new war, and I want you to know your government is doing everything we can to defeat those who hate freedom. It's so important for Americans to know that the traffic in drugs finances the work of terror, sustaining terrorists. I mean, even right now I read where they equated drug use with terrorism. So that's the first step in saying that if you use drugs you can be locked up as a terrorist, because you support a terrorist organization. Your use of drugs. The terrorists use drug profits to fund their cells to commit acts of murder. If you quit drugs, you join the fight against terror in America. The time has arrived. I got a little thing I used to do, still do. When I went back doing comedy, and so, I hadn't been on stage for almost 10 years when I went back to do comedy again, and I had no act. So I did this little time thing where I said, I'm gonna remember this moment, when I had no act, and I'm gonna remember this moment 10 years from now, when I been on the road for 10 years, and I've got tons of material. Because it was sort of like a helpless feeling, that you're caught in this time warp. So that's kinda how I'm handling this little trip I'm going on. Because I wanna remember. I'm not gonna remember, not so much dwelling on the fact that I'm leaving. I'm looking forward to the time when I'm coming back. That's the time I'm gonna be remembering. It's funny, Arnold gets, we were gonna have a governor named Arnold. I got a feeling we're not. I mean, if they elect Arnold, I mean, then we really are a nation of retards. I talked to the prison, Taft Prison, finding out what I can bring and everything. What happened to your glasses? These are, these are mine. And they said... Oh, they're old, Honey, I got kind of a broke one. I'm gonna throw these out. Throw what out? Your glasses. What? These ones. Why? Well, it's embarrassing. You know better... I can use them. No, I'm gonna throw it out. Honey, don't do that, don't throw my stuff... You only get to take on pair to prison, Honey. The guy at the prison, I said, what can I bring into prison with me? He gave me a list. I can get, uh, gray sweatpants. Gray sweatshirt with no hoods. White T-shirt. Gray underwear or white underwear. Wedding band. Uh-oh. Might have a sensor on it. And he says, and you can bring prescription drugs, provided you have a prescription from the doctor. So I says, well, I got a prescription for marijuana, can I bring that? And he goes, "Hah-hah-hah, no." They're pretty nice. It's gonna be a nice adventure, adventure.

You're there, you've been there. Tommy phoned me this morning. It was like 7:30, and he'd been up since five, and he's doing really well. It's fine in there, he has a lot of fans. Oh, God. He was there about a week before I got there, and somebody said, uh, I asked when I got over there, I said, I heard Tommy Chong's over here. And, yeah, there he goes. And I looked, and I said, hell, I thought he was taller than that... Steve is my dawg, he's the guy I walk the track with. And we play Bocci Ball now. First thing they did with him, they tried to get him to take anger management. He goes, "What do I need anger management for?" People were even saying, Man, I bet he's gonna be smokin' dope over there. Everybody's just gonna be, I bet he brings in a bunch of dope. There was a dude that wanted to smoke a joint with Tommy. And I kind of watched Tommy's back when I was in there. That's what dawgs do. I looked over, I said, is that dope? He said, yeah. I said, get your ass outta here with that, you stupid... I had some choice words for him. There are so many snitches in that place. It's a jail, Man. I guess the Sergeant's next door, he's talkin' and these walls are thin. Maybe they got secret monitors on or something... I'm the resident celebrity, so I spend a lot of time taking pictures with the inmates. Which I love, I love.

There are people in here that desperately needed a voice. They desperately needed me to be in here, so I could be doing exactly this, because no one's speaking for them. Because there's so many stories in here, there's so many innocent people that are being incarcerated for no reason. We gotta move on. You know, my dad's gonna be fine. He's a tough guy, he's in prison, and he's fine. He can't wait to get out, but you know what, he's fine. They're not gonna take anything away. They're just makin' him bigger and stronger, and something serious to reckon with. Because when he gets out, I mean, talk about inspired. I feel tremendously guilty, and I feel very responsible for convincing my parents to get into this business, so, you know, I'm gonna do my best to make this up to them. And it's not something that they've instilled in me, and said, that, you know, you owe us, or anything like that. So, I don't want that to sound like that. It's just something that I see that I've observed and that I want to do for my family. See, there's no set rules, because you never know. Like, a lot of people say it was wrong for this guy to go to jail, but yet he wrote a great novel while he was in there. You know, because people's experiences, Man, how can you say they're right or wrong. It's what, people go through what they need to go through, in order to get some use of living on Earth, you know? So how can you make any judgment? I can't. All we can do it just be funny, that's all, and make people laugh. Hi, there, Groovy Guys and Groovy Girls, welcome to Let's Make A Dope Deal!

When you go to jail, when you end up in jail, when you're in the system, you're in the system. They own your ass. They want people to fail the piss test. That's why they have piss tests, and that's why they have these probation periods. It's a game. This government is equipped to handle rebels. That's exactly what these laws were designed to do. Yeah, you're free, but not really. This is still a gift, no, it's large. I'm allowed to go out and work at World Gym... For minimum wage, which they get 25%. In Nice Dreams Zabo plays himself, you know, in the gym. Cheech and I go in the gym, and I bring Zabo a bud. This bud's for you. Wow. Zabo, Zabo taught me how to smoke pot. In the '60s. Did you really teach him how to smoke pot? How's that? Come on, you kidding? Inhale? He's the master. But we always smoked together at my place. And I'd hate to have to tell you who else was there. He wouldn't like it. Who? We'll give you a hint. He's the governor of Calfornia. He's the governor. Almost outta jail. You're a free man. Free man. Free at last. But here I am, and I feel different, you know that? I feel, I feel free. When they say doin' time, I really understand it now, 'cause you're messing with time. Or time's messing with you. You're finding out what it's like to have your time controlled. Well, but there's a feeling, there's a, wow. I feel it. I wasn't sure if I would feel it. How does it feel? Like it was all a dream. I believe he's losin' his mind. I think he's lost his mind. I'm living proof that stoners can be efficient, uh, what word am I looking for? Hard working, diligent.

Tommy Chong is on the show tonight. We have Tommy Chong. Let's go, uh... Tommy. Tommy flew into town last night on the red eye, I understand. In fact he brought a clip. It's a roach clip, but he has a clip. A million of these. A water pipe itself is not illegal, is it? No, but if it has my face on it, it is. Now where did you send it. Because you can buy water, you can go to Santo Monica Boulevard and buy a water pipe. It was sent to Pennsylvania, to a little head shop run by the DEA. Okay, so, isn't that entrapment? They ordered it, they asked you to send it. Isn't that entrapment? I, yeah, but this is America... Okay, yeah. There's no such thing as entrapment anymore. And where was the prison? Where'd you get sent? Oh, Taft, California. It's near Bakersfield. Oh, okay. Real nice. In fact, I wanna say hi real nice? to all the guys at Taft, they're watching. I'm here, Man. Hey, Steve. Tommy Chong is 66 now, and the man who along with his buddy, Cheech, parlayed stoner comedy into best selling albums is on the comeback trail. Comeback because Tommy Chong was released from federal prison in July after spending nine months in a California minimum security facility. Tommy Chong performs tonight and Saturday night at Stanford & Sons Comedy Club in Overland Park. These'll be his first standup shows in the US since he went to prison. Introduce to you the biggest stoner of them all, the Maharishi of Marijuana, the King of Dope, the one, the only Mr. Tommy Chong! I'm kinda feelin' good now. Feels good, Man. I don't give a fuck what anybody says. Jail's not fun. At this point in your life people hear the names Cheech and Chong and they think of drug use. What do you make of that at this point in your career. I, there again, you know, it's more, um, it's a badge of honor that I'm very proud to carry, especially now, you know, because I've been, you know, martyred... It's kinda weird, you know. Especially the guards. The first time I was in there, the guard's a big fan, and he goes, "Hey, I got all your records. "Okay, um, turn around and spread your ass." Well, Cheech and I, we were gonna do a movie together. We still might, if I can get him to be Cheech again. But he changed. He went 180 degrees the other way. What do you mean, religious? No, no, he just doesn't wanna be that Chicano character anymore. He's grown outta that, he's grown up, in other words. Because the partner, the Cheech that I used to be with, is gone. He's not there anymore. Kansas City, the home of John Ashcroft. Boo! That's my buddy, Man. Old John... He hasn't seen the last of me. Needless to say, I want to thank US Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania Mary Beth Buchanan. That's a lot of work on behalf of the American people and the children of America. In June, 2004, John Ashcroft promoted Mary Beth Buchanan to director of all 94 US Attorneys, making her the most powerful federal prosecutor in the nation. And in November, claiming that he had secured the nation from crime and terror, John Ashcroft resigned. When they targeted, when the Justice Department, when Ashcroft, Walters decided to go after Tommy Chong and the bong manufacturers in Operation Pipe Dream, it may have been the ultimate symbol of the absurdity and the silliness of the war on drugs. It's a civil rights issue. It's about the power of the government to choose who they don't like and destroy them. You can sit quietly by while pot smokers and people like Tommy Chong are in prison and think it has nothing to do with you, and then one day it may have something to do with you. I told him after I got to know Tommy, and he told me about his case and stuff, I laughed and told him, uh, you know, you know why you're doing time. And he said why. Because of the character you play. You were so good you convinced them all that that's who you are. One over here Tommy, please. Ah. See, it wasn't like I was in a contest and I had lost. I wasn't defeated, by any means. The ultimate aim was to bring me down. That's what they wanted. They wanted that stoner that they saw in the movies, because I represent their worst nightmare. I'm their kids, I'm their grandkids, I'm there total worst nightmare. I wasn't an activist before they put me in jail. But I sat in jail, and I looked around, and I seen what was goin' on in America, and I tell people now. They say, what was jail like? I say, well, you'll find out. You'll find out. 'Cause they can put anybody in jail any time they want. And don't think they won't. Keep awake. Be alive. And make sure we vote. Make sure we get everybody out there and vote these fuckers out of office. Thank you. Tommy Chong, Ladies and Gentlemen, Tommy Chong. Everything in this drama, it was exciting. It was exciting and it was sad. It was all of that, but it's not over. The fight wasn't over. It wasn't like, oh, I lost, I gotta go to jail and start my life over again. No, it was, what happened is just the beginning. It's like a chapter.
