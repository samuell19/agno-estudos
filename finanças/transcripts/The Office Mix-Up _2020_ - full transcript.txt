Oh, can I help you find something? Hi, yeah, please, I'm looking for an engagement ring. Well, what kind of ring does she like? I'm not too sure, I was kinda hoping you could help me with that. I can do that. So why don't we start with, oh, whoopsies. All right, let's just start simple. - Start with the diamonds. - The diamonds. So what were you thinking, like, princess, asscher, cushion, round cut, emerald cut, radiant? I didn't know there were that many options actually. Oh yeah, there's a lot, there's a lot of options besides it's sort of nice sometimes when you have an idea what she likes 'cause then you know exactly what. Why don't you just tell me about how you're proposing? You know what? I think I'm gonna come back. I'm gonna think about it, I'll come back. Oh but, you know what, actually. Thank you for your help, thank you. I just want you to know that there's insurance. Yeah, appreciate it, bye. Thank you for shopping with us. Yep! And I love your dog. Joan. Lacey. Oh, please tell me you didn't just see that. See what? Oh, you turned the most exciting moment in a young man's life, into a full blown panic attack? Yeah, I saw that. Okay, I'm sorry, it's just a big decision. Yeah and it's your job to help navigate that. But you cannot do it if you're second guessing yourself. Right, I know, it's really tough, you know? I mean, how do you do this everyday? It's so much pressure. I could pick a ring and he could like it and then she could hate it and I could be the one that turns their happily ever after into a happily never after. Oh my God Lacey. What? You've got a great eye for this. You have the motivation to be really amazing at it. But you can't if you don't trust yourself. Yeah. You just need some self confidence. Yeah, I can, you know, I can do that. Look how great you've gotten at your night custodian job. Night security. - You always get that wrong. - Security? Yeah, security. But that's not like a job, it's just what I'm doing to get rid of my debt. - Right. - It doesn't really count. How's it going hanging out at your mum's house? It's tough, you remember, she was so proud when she finally got that house and now that she's gone, I can't just, you know, get rid of it. No, you can't. But I'm sure she'd already be disappointed enough in me as it is, right? Working random jobs and living alone, single, no boyfriend. Okay, first of all, you're not alone, you have Brutus. Brutus is a fish. A great fish. And secondly, you put your whole life on hold to take care of her while she was sick. I mean, it only makes sense that you're playing a little bit of catch-up right now. You know, you're figuring things out, figuring out who you are. And I know for a fact that she'd be so proud of you. Yeah. Why don't you clock out, get some rest before your night shift. Are you sure, I can stay. Nah, it's okay, plus I know I can chase off customers on my own. Oh, that's very funny. Okay Brutus, what've we got? Bill, ooh, credit card offer, bill. You're gonna need to start paying rent little buddy. And reminding me when I'm late. ♪ And I got you ♪ ♪ And I got you ♪ ♪ And I got you ♪ Keller, you're late. I know, sorry Bertie, I lost track of time. You know who never loses track of time? Shenanigans. Yeah, thought you were gonna say that. You see shenanigans is the reason why we exist. But you gotta be extra vigilant, they can take any form. A fake fire alarm, an unexpected raccoon, some kid with a bottle of shaving cream and a sob story about forgetting his sandwich in the bathroom. Believe me, that's not a trick you fall for a third time. I'm gonna take your word for it. All right, make sure you do your patrols. You got it. Don't touch any buttons, all right? Okay, bye Bertie. We have already heard six versions of get your vacay on, the next person who pitches me get your vacay on, is going to be on permanent vacay on. - Oh! - Oh, oh my God, oh. I'm so sorry. That's okay. Where've you been? - Me? - Yeah. Oh, I was just picking up a sandwich and then I threw it on the floor. Oh, we need you in here. Okay. Erin go to Bruisers and get another roast turkey. Oh, they close in five minutes. Well you'd better run then. Okay. Oh, no mayo! Yeah sure, sure. Okay, what've we got? How about, how about this? Get your vacay on, huh? And I didn't think my day could get any worse. Ugh, God. Oh, what's going on in here? Bertie, I thought I heard something. Shenanigans. Yep, shenanigans, except no. 'Cause clearly the room is empty, so. Yeah, I once thought a room was empty. Turns out, it was full of teenagers dressed up like mannequins. Right, well shall we? All right Bertie, it was a quiet night. Yeah, except for the conference room incident. Wasn't really an incident. That's how incidents always begin. Right, well I'm off to help Joan with some inventory, so I'll see you tomorrow Bertie. See you tomorrow. Just add... Oh no, no, no, no, no! Lacey, back so soon? Okay, Bertie yeah, I just, I forgot I have to go to the bathroom. I've been there, sister. Look, I know we're all exhausted at this point but we don't have it, we gotta keep pushing. Sorry. Take a seat. We gotta come up with something good. We've got some good ideas but nothing solid, you know? I don't know. - I know it's hard - Excuse me. But we just gotta push through. Thank you, no, no. I don't know, do you need something? Me, nope, I think you said it all. Really, just working hard and yeah I think that's it, so. - Okay. - Yeah. All right guys well... Who do you want to Empress? Empress yourself, no ordinary vacation. This is what you guys have been working on? Well it's not everything. There's a couple of other really good ideas, well this is a strong one. Get your vacay on. Get my what? It's a terrible idea, I don't like that one either. Yeah, I don't like that one either, that's bad. Bad, let's cross that one off. What's all this stuff? You know what... Empress, all inclusive resorts. Is this yours? Yes. So why is this in here? Right, I was just actually, I was just leaving. And not up on the wall with the others? Wait, what? This is great, just add you, I like that. It's clever, it stimulates the imagination, it's guest centric, it's everything we've been talking about, right Greg? Yeah, yeah. I like it, I want mock-ups on my desk by tomorrow afternoon, good work everybody. You heard the man, let's get working on that. Excuse me. Excuse me? Hello? Hello, hey, wait up, hi! I'm Greg. Hi. - Hi. - Excuse me. Do I know you, do you work here? Yes, bye. Valerie Staken, right? Mikey said he'd made you an offer but I thought you went to Wolf and Waldren? Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea, I'm gonna do that. Oh no, no, no, no, no, not with that idea you're not. I've seen my brother smile at about six pitches in his entire life and the other five were his, so. Cynthia, meet Miss Valerie Staken. I thought you went to Wolf and Waldren. Well I... She's staying here with us, now. How nice you came in to save the day for us. I'm... Erin, I'm gonna set her up in Chuck's old office and we need to get her down with Mary Kate ASAP, she needs to work on this mock-ups, you'll love her. Wait, I think you're... - Mistaken? - Yes! Miss Taken I'll just need you to stop by my desk this afternoon to fill out some paperwork. There's been a mix-up. I know, I know and I'm gonna fix that, okay? I don't know who told me you were supposed to go to Wolf and Waldren, but I'm fixing that right now. She's nice. Hmm. I already work here. Yeah, you should get back to it. Oh. I know, we'll get you a bigger office as soon as we can. No this is amazing. It's just I... Is it the bonus? Because you deserve it. No, bonus, what bonus? The sales bonus, if Empress hires us, you get a $5,000 bonus. Um. Hey, are you all right? $5,000? Yeah, it's in your contract. I didn't see that. Yeah, who reads those things anyway. So you'll let me know if you need anything, right? Valerie? Yeah, I think I'm all set. - Great. - Okay. So happy you're here. You took the job? Well, yes. What? I've known you my whole life so I might have missed this part but when exactly did you lose your mind? Okay, look, Joanie, I love working with you at the jewelry store. No you don't. No, I don't actually, I don't. I kinda suck at it. You're not great. It's not where I'm supposed to be. And where you're supposed to be is at a job you've never done taking another woman's identity at a place you already work, makes sense! Look, at the end of the week, they're pitching Empress Resorts, they choose my idea, I get a bonus and that's it, bada boom, bada bing, I'm outta there. And it's enough money for me to get caught up on my mortgage. Wow, what about your security job? What about it, I keep it. So you're gonna work all night and then work all day? Well, I mean I get off at five and the security job doesn't start until 11 so I'll run home and I'll sleep for a few hours in between, it'll be fine. I mean, the only real problem would be that I'll have to dodge Bertie's daily patrol but... And everyone else while you're in uniform. No, no, no, no one else knows I even exist there, trust me, they're way too busy. But I can do it. One week. One week, that's it. Yeah, it'll be a piece of cake. Walkie check one-two. Walkie check, come back. Hey Lacey. Oh hey Bertie. What are you working on there? This, oh, just writing a letter. Oh yeah, to who? To myself, to my future self. Oh, well tell you I said hi. I will do that. Everything okay Lacey? Yeah. Are you sure? Yep, yeah, I was just doing some training exercises, like you told me because, you know, you can never be too careful. I hear you sister. So. Physical fitness is of chief importance. Lacey, forgot your book. Oh. What've we got? Did you hear that? I'm on it. Apple shenanigans. Oh yeah, yeah for sure, I mean, looks good. Thank you, I appreciate that. I'm so, I'm so sorry, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - You're not bleeding. No, I'm fine. Don't worry you're not bleeding. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. - I was just so excited - I'm fine. To get to work. That's what we like to see here. - Are you okay? - Yes, excitement. Yeah, settling in okay? Yeah, couldn't be smoother. Okay, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go talk to Mikey. Oh, his head! How're the mock-ups coming along? - Huh? - The mock-ups. Oh, great, yeah, really good, I came up with a few new ideas last night that I'm really excited about. Ooh! Yeah, do you think you could tell me where Mary Kate's office is? Oh yeah, it's, you know what? Why don't you get some coffee and I'll bring the mock-ups to Mary Kate? Oh, are you sure? Yes, it's no problem. That's very nice of you Cynthia. Absolutely. Really use that cup of coffee too, right? I get it, it's no problem. Okay, thanks, bye. Bye! Hey bro. Hey, I hear you've been looking for me? I have, so. So? How great is the campaign? I mean, I think Empress is gonna love it. Actually, I've been thinking. Uh-oh, you've been thinking? Yeah, I wanna run this campaign. You wanna run the campaign? You think you're ready to run the campaign? I've been working on it for months now, and you saw what I did with the Martley and Mitchel campaigns. Greg, Empress Resorts is a big job buddy. I mean, it's a dozen properties in eight countries. I know, I can do it bro, I'm ready for this. Look you're always telling me, you want me to assume some more responsibility, right? Gimme a shot. All right, I'll tell you what, if you nail it and we get the account, the job is yours. All right, you won't regret it, thanks buddy. Don't thank me yet, it's a big if. I'd better get back to work then. Yeah, you better get back to work. And I'm gonna give you your office back. Thanks, bro. Good morning Miss Staken. Oh please, you can call me La, Valerie. La-Valerie? How about just Val? Val it is, so I stocked your desk, we have Post-its, pens, paperclips, but let me know if there's anything else you need. Oh, and you're meeting with Greg got pushed to noon so I will get you some lunch from Bruisers. Oh, okay. Oh gosh, any recommendations? Oh, I never get lunch. Oh, is this place bad? No, no, I'm just not normally included in the lunch orders, it's execs only. Oh, well what would you get? People love the roast turkey. Perfect, roast turkey it is and espresso. You got it La-Valerie. Oh, Erin. What? - Oh! - Ah! Oh. - Hi. - Hi, can I come in? Yes, please, sorry, I wasn't expecting you. It's okay, I kinda feel a little nervous about this, so I wanna go over the mock-ups once more before the meeting, is that okay? Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. All right, good, we're all set up the conference room. Okay, oh no, wait, why don't we just do it in here? Because we're all set up in the conference room. Yeah but who wants to be in a huge conference room when we can be here, in my office? You know, here, with the blinds closed, or open. Okay, yeah, I'll go get everything. Wait no. No you're right, let's just do it in the conference room. So, how'd the brainstorm go last night? Oh, great yeah, I came up with some new ideas actually, but I gave them to Cynthia to take down to Mary Kate this morning, so, otherwise I'd show you. Oh you can just talk me through 'em. - Oh. - Oh! Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah, everything's fine, why'd you ask? Because you're standing on my foot. Oh, sorry. It's okay, are you sure you're all right? 'Cause you seem a little distracted. Wow, oh, this is amazing. Oh my gosh, yesterday these were just sketches and today they're here, they're real. Seems like you've never seen one of your ideas turned into a mock-up before. No, I have, of course I have. I just, these are just, Mary Kate's images are just exactly what I had in mind. Oh yeah, she's the best. Oh, speaking of the best, for photography. Jane Carr, ever worked with her? 'Cause she's got such an amazing eye. I think she'd be perfect for this. I mean it's up to you, of course, but I think she'd be perfect for this. Yeah, I do too, I think that sounds... Yeah? Yeah, yes totally. Good. No, I think it's actually really good, it hits the family angle for them. Yeah, I think it's perfect. Yeah, I do too. It's like, and you can have a different, you know, like twins or you know, just two... Twins are always good. Yes, always, right? Double the trouble, double the fun. Oh, Cynthia, what do you think about this? Two kids maybe on a beach somewhere, in the air, possibly piggybacking Piggybacking, yeah. And we do, just add you for the parents. Clever. Right? Clever, yeah. Val just came up with that. Ah. Well no, we came up with it together. Like a joint effort, right. Yes, it was, it was totally joint effort. Brilliant and modest, how lovely. Mary Kate made copies, the mock-ups will be ready in time for the meeting. Oh, yes, thank you Cynthia. Oh, could you tell Erin to move my 3 o' clock? Yeah, wait, I'm your 3 o' clock. Oh you're my 3 o' clock? Well, that's okay, you don't mind right? I mean, I wanna personally take Val down to meet Mary Kate. We really need to talk about Flemming's new produce line. We will, we will, we will... Erin! Oh Erin, can you move our 3 o' clock to sometime next week? Just push it off. You are an angel, right. Oh wait, wait, wait, don't go away, here. Oh, no, I can't take your lunch. How can you recommend the roast turkey sandwich if you're never tried it? You have to, it's for work. Thank you. What, seriously, thank you. You're the one that got us lunch. Thank you Erin. Thank you Erin. So should we get started or should we have? Oh yeah, no we should get right into it actually. Okay, what you got for us Cynthia? We have four mock-ups so far, I dropped three more sketches off to Mary Kate and she's working on them now. Well let's focus on two or three of those for the first pitch, okay? Absolutely, that's what we should do. Yeah. Yes. So? So? Well done man, well done. I think these are gonna work across print, TV and digital. Empress is gonna be very very happy. It's new girl Val, I'm telling you man, she's a genius. - Really? - Yeah. Well why don't you and the genius keep working on it? What'd you mean, I thought you said you liked the ideas. I do, I love 'em, now let's see if you can beat 'em and we will pick the finalists tomorrow. You're very difficult to work with, you know that? I do know that. Great job Greg, way to step it up. You have got to stop lurking outside of my door! You have to stop opening the door before I knock. What're you doing? It's 5 o' clock, I'm going home, what do you mean? You can't go home now. But I... I talked to Mikey and he loves everything but he wants at least a few more ideas for tomorrow, so. It's gonna be a late night. Erin, can you take dinner orders please? Gonna be a late night. I have somewhere to be, so. What, you got a side hustle to pay the bills? No seriously, look, Empress is priority right now, all right? So, cancel it, and remember, smile, it's gonna be fun. Do you know what you'd like for dinner Val? We have Mexican, Chinese, Italian... Does he do this a lot? Work late, every week. And you have to stay with him, right? The thing about Greg is he's not inconsiderate, he's just completely oblivious. He's passionate about what he does, you know it's a lot of pressure following in the family footsteps and sometimes I think that's all he can see. Lucky for us. Why don't I get you another espresso? Make it a double. All right, do we have enough about the pool cabana? We've got the pool cabana. Okay, and do we have the swim-up bar? We've got the swim-up bar. We have the swim-up bar, we've got the stand-up bar, we have the poolside cabana drink service, we've got it all. Am I over doing it? Maybe a little. I'm sorry, I knew it, I just, you know, this is my first major solo account and I just wanna prove it to Mikey. His approval means a lot to you, doesn't it? Well, you know, he was the older brother, so, you know, he was always the first, the favorite, the most muscular, I don't know, I just. You just want something of your own. You know honestly, it's not even about him, I just wanna prove it to myself. Yeah, I get that. You got siblings? No, I just I get it and I know what it's like to wanna prove yourself to yourself. Really, I mean, you're doing such great work, I don't know how you have room for self doubt. Well thank you but you are not doing so bad yourself boss. Well how 'bout we prove ourselves to ourselves together? Yes, yes, I like that, that's good, yes. No. Well we don't have to? No, no, I just mean, it's 11, it's after 11 Yes, this is late. So I'm going to double check everything tonight and I will drop everything off to the printer in the morning, okay? Well, how about I walk you out? No, someone is waiting for me, so. Oh, oh, you have a someone. No, no no, I don't, I have, not like a someone, someone. Just like a someone but do you have? Oh no, I don't have a someone, no someone. Oh, good, I mean not like, I don't mean like, good. - I just mean like, you know. - I get it. No but it's good. - Good? - Good. Yeah, so. Okay, so, goodnight Greg. All right, good night. Good night. Get home safe. Hello? This is private property. Trespassing punishable by arrest. Something about this stairwell. Bertie! Stairwell clear. Lacey, I didn't see you come in. Oh, well I did otherwise I wouldn't be here, right? Are you already doing the rounds, it's early. Yeah, just doing a quick check of the parameter. You know, you can never be too careful, right? All right. It's getting late, you should get home. - Yeah, I gotta feed my cat. - Right. Hey, you ever hear any funny noises in the hallways or in the stairwell? Forget it, nothing, I'll see you tomorrow. Good night Bertie. Okay, let's see. All right, so they're not, I mean, perfect but... They're sketches, I get that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow, Lacey. Wow. I'm so glad you came and brought this, thank you, you're seriously, you're a lifesaver. Well you know. How did you know? I went by your place this afternoon, you weren't there so I figured you got stuck at work. Yeah, you figured right. So, how's it going? Well, aside from the sleep deprivation and the unremitting anxiety, pretty great. Yeah, that sounds great. Oh and Greg. The cute one. He's so cute, he's just so, I don't know, he's just so dreamy. He's great and he loves all of my ideas, we've been working together a ton and they turned some of my sketches into full sized artwork. Lacey. Can you believe that? That's incredible. I know, it's amazing, it feels like, I don't know, for the first time, it feels like I might actually be really good at this. Anyway, they have this new client coming in next month, it's for this, like, this restaurant. Wait, next month? Yeah. I thought this was only supposed to be for a week? I mean, I know. Whoa, Lacey. I know. Look, I'm so happy that you've found something that you love, I really am, but don't you remember the plan? Yeah. Get in, get the bonus, get out before... Before I get too attached, I know. I was gonna say arrested but yeah. Arrested, arrested? You're committing fraud. Joan, come on. You have a plan. I'm not, that's... Stick to the plan. You don't have to make me feel bad about it, I have... Stick to the plan. Okay, I know, you're right. You're right, you're right, you're right. It's gonna be okay. Oh good, you're here early. Yep. Cynthia wants to meet with us, conference room in five? Okay. Okay, bring the final version of the ads for the printer. You got it. Okay. Okay, let's wrap this up. Lacey are those the final versions? Actually I was thinking about the idea of just add you, and it's fine but I think it's missing something. I was thinking maybe we could just open it up a little bit? A couple meets at a bar, just add romance. A rock climbers climbing off of a wall, just add adventure. A family is walking down a beach, just add fun. These are really good Cynthia but I think we should stick with the just add you tagline for this pitch, okay? I think that this expands the world of the ad. It could also muddy the water. Just add you, it's clean, invites the audience into the ad, you know? Also our presentation is in a few hours, so I think we should stick with what we got. I disagree actually, I think that this shows the client that we can expand beyond the initial idea. Val what do you think? I don't know. It's your creative, what'd you think about Cynthia's ideas? Well I mean, I think they're good ideas. But should we include them in the pitch? I, um, ooh. You know what, I'll make the call on this one. Sorry Cynthia, it's good but we'll table them for maybe later on in the campaign. Okay, anything else? No, we good? Yes, I triple checked everything last night, so we're good, we're all set. All right, get those to the printer immediately and I'll see you guys in a few hours. - Okay, this is it? - Yeah. Big day, game time. Hey Cynthia, I really, I did think it was a good idea. Yeah, don't worry about it. Wait, maybe Greg's right, maybe later in the campaign? I've gotta get these to the printer. Okay, yeah, 10 minute nap. Valerie, Valerie? Val? Hey Val. Oh yes, yes, Val, that's me, I was just heading to my office. Yeah, do you have a second? Oh, sure what's up? I just put together a little supporting material for your pitch, I thought maybe you might wanna take a look? Oh, thank you Erin, wow. Oh my gosh, this is great. No, it's nothing. This is not nothing, are you kidding me? Market research, competitive analysis, growth potential, you did all this? Can I show you one more thing? Yeah sure, is something wrong? You tell me, it looks like you haven't slept in a week. Oh, I'm just tired. No need to explain, I have been chronically sleep deprived myself. I've actually been taking night classes the last few years and with the tests and the homework, it's been... What, what are you studying? Marketing, I was, graduation's actually this weekend. My God, congratulations! Thanks, it's been a long few years, working all day, class at night but it's been a dream of mine forever. And now it's finally happening. I can't believe no one said anything. I didn't tell 'em. What, why? Well you know Greg and Cynthia are so busy with Empress and they... Erin, I'm sure they would wanna know. Look, I love my job but Greg and Cynthia don't worry to much about what I'm up to as long as their calendars are updated and their lunch orders are right. Still, you need to celebrate. - I am celebrating. - Good! Tonight, my entire family's coming in from North Dakota, I'm actually picking them up right after work. But right now, I'm sharing my secret nap room. No one ever comes in here, so sometimes I grab a quick nap on my lunch break. This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. But I really shouldn't. You really should, you don't wanna be falling asleep during the Empress meeting this afternoon. I've got you covered. Well maybe, just for a little bit. I'll wake you for lunch. Erin, congratulations. You should be so proud of yourself. Thank you, Val. Yeah. Where's Val? She had an important appointment, she'll be back in time for the pitch. Well, tell her I got the conference room set up for her so she is good to go. That was nice of you. I'm a really nice person. Val, Valerie! Secure one. - What? - What? Val, the meeting is starting soon, time to get up. Okay. You might wanna double check the conference room. Right. Sorry. Yeah. Okay, here we go. You ready for this? Yes, I can't wait. Neither can I. Right this way, right this way, take a seat over here if you wouldn't mind, we're excited to show you what we have, take a seat here, we're very excited to present this campaign to you. Look forward to your thoughts, thank you. Take a seat. - Ready? - Yeah, here we go. Hi everyone. Empress Resorts, it's an all inclusive resort, it offers your guests fun, food and activities and all just steps away from your hotel room. And, all included in that one final price. But there is one thing that isn't included. And that's what this campaign is about. Your guests, right? We are gonna show your guests everything that Empress has to offer, right? And a dream vacation doesn't have to just be a dream. In fact, it's as easy as just showing up. Just add you. So, we got, fun, family and fish, just add you. - Dinner, dancing and drinks. - Greg. Just add you. - Sun, sand and sea. - Greg. Just add you. And all at Impress. All at... You know what, well it looks like we aren't quite as prepared as I thought we were, if you wouldn't mind just stepping back down to my office while we sort this out, I would appreciate that, okay? Sorry about that. Just right this way. Just give us a moment, okay? All right, just give us a moment. Just a moment, please. - Greg? - Yeah? - Come with me. - Oh wait Greg... Not now. Is it over already? Yeah, we had a problem with the artwork. Who was in charge of proofing it? I was but I checked it, I mean, I know I did, I checked it like hundred times. I just, I don't. I checked it. No, yep, I get it, thank you. Thank you so much Larry. All right, I appreciate it, I owe you one, bye. What'd they say? They think we're idiots. I know that part. You're lucky I play poker with his head of marketing, he thinks he can get us a second chance. Oh, thanks Mikey, oh my gosh, I'll give you all the files so you can just... Give me the files? I don't want the files. No, no, no, pal, this is all you. You've gotta go out there and save it. They're angry. Yeah, they're angry. Well, you know, we couldn't even remember the client's name, so, I mean really, when we can't remember the client's name, how much attention are we actually paying to the campaign? This is because you rely too much on your people. This is up to you, don't rely on your people. I know, I know, it's my fault. I should have double checked everything. Absolutely and now you know. So, get on it, go make this right. Yeah. I don't understand. I mean, I checked it, I know that I checked it, I checked it a thousand times. I talked to Mary Kate and she said she doesn't even have the originals so Cynthia, did you? I dropped them off at the art department. I don't know what happened after that. Did we lose the account? They're giving us a second chance. Oh, that's great. Okay, all right, I'm gonna talk to Mary Kate and I... You know, I don't think we're gonna need you on this one anymore, Val. What, what'd you mean? Cynthia and I can take it from here, thanks. Greg? You should get back to work. Yeah okay. Is everything okay? What, what, yeah, what're you still doing here? I'm leaving now, I just wanna make sure you're okay. Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Are you sure you're all right? Yes, I'm good, you should get outta here though. Tonight's your big night, go celebrate, yeah congratulations. Erin can you take dinner orders, it's gonna be another late night. I actually can't stay... Erin, we almost just lost the Empress campaign, I need all hands on deck. I know but I actually... Just take the orders now please. Everything okay, ma'am? Emotional shenanigans. Wow, Impress Resorts? Hmm-mm. So I'm guessing they were not impressed? No, they just walked out and Greg, oh my God. The cute one? Yeah, well, he's not that cute when he's angry. What am I saying, yes he is and that makes it so much worse, oh God. Maybe it was a printing error? Could be, who knows? Yeah, I don't know. But I guess that is the end of Valerie Staken. Well, least she last longer than I thought she would. Whoa, what's that supposed to mean? No, you just, you know. Wait, no, what? I mean this isn't like it's out of the ordinary. - What? - You try, and then there's like a little hiccup and you bail. Little hiccup, this was not a little... A little, a big, a big ginormous loud one. What? I'm just saying that, you know, you go to a certain point and then it gets too hard and you're out. That is not true. I don't do that. The coffee shop. Oh come on, those beans were not locally sourced. The pet store. I was allergic to the rabbits, I mean that's... The bead shop, the library. Okay, all right, Joan, you've made your point. That's not my point. Look, okay, my point is, and I love you like a sister, my point is that you can do anything you put your mind to. I just hope that you set your mind to something before it's too late. What you think, any advice Brutus? Yeah, I didn't think so. I can't believe I didn't check it before it went to the printer. No, it's not your fault, I mean none of us would have thought Val would make such an obvious mistake. Well, from now on, everything comes through me, I wanna go in there with the right material this time. You think it's enough? What'd you mean? I mean, we just offended our clients and then chased them outta the room. We the just add you campaign, you know? It's gonna be associated in their heads now with the Impress Resorts. What'd you suggest? Bring a new idea to the table, something different. Maybe my idea of expanding the just add you tag. I don't know, I mean, they were pretty specific with us what they wanted. Well we bring something different to the table, something that helps them forget about that pitch. Okay, let's give it another look. Nothing gets by old Bertie. Erin, what are you still doing here? Aren't you supposed to be with your family? Greg asked me to stay. Asked? Well. Erin, don't take this the wrong way but if you are not out of here and on your way to the airport in the next 60 seconds, you're fired. I gotta get these ordered. 59, 58. Are you sure that you can? 50 seconds. Thank you Val. Erin, will you bring my portfolio? Some coffee. Erin's leaving. What? I sent her home. Excuse me? No, excuse me, Greg. Did you even know why she needed the night off? I didn't think... Know you didn't think about it, because you never ever think about Erin. She's graduating, this weekend, and her entire family is in town right now, waiting for her. Well she didn't say anything about that. You never even gave her the chance. And what about you? You barely even acknowledge her, I've only been here for what, a week, a week, and I can already see that Erin is the glue that holds this entire place together. Didn't I send you home? Yeah. Yeah, you did Greg and that's another thing, I'm not going home. This is my creative and it's a damn good one. So we're gonna stick with it and here's what you're gonna do next. You're gonna call a florist and you're gonna order the most beautiful bouquet of flowers to be sitting on Erin's desk by the time she arrives tomorrow morning. And then, we're gonna get some coffee for ourselves, this time, and then we're gonna fix this mess. Any questions? No, good, let's move. Wow. What was that about? I don't know but I kinda liked it. What are you doing? Oh, I'm ordering flowers for Erin. Can you get me a hazelnut, two sugars. Yes, hello, hi, I need a big beautiful bouquet of flowers. I called the right place, that's good. Okay, it's a business, yes. Wants me to get him a coffee. Yeah, what am I, an assistant, one of your interns? Yeah, I'll get a coffee for you and your little girlfriend. Idiots. Still got it. Sleeping shenanigans. I mean, we all feel like it's a great idea, so it just takes some finesse. Yeah, okay, well let's go over all the options. I agree, okay, I'm gonna get my portfolio. Okay. Oh. You okay? I think I'm having a new idea. Are you? Nope, false alarm. You know what, it's past 11 so let's just pick this up tomorrow. - It's kinda late so, - But we just got okay, great. The ball rolling. Bye. She just gets to leave. It's just the way she works, it's her method. Method to the madness. To catch a rat, you must become a cat. We got one! Boo, what's going on in here? Bertie, I... Wait a minute, you decided to get in the phantom sleeper's bed? To get in the phantom sleeper's head. Oh, that's the name I'm trying it, what'd you think? Phantom sleeper. Yes, that's exactly what I've been doing. Okay, so what did we learn. Well, I'll tell ya, Bertie, nothing. Right. Nothing. There's no way to get inside the head of a maniac like this. All we can do is wait. Come on back to the desk, I brought donuts. Aww, you know actually, I'm just gonna stay here for a few more minutes. Can't let go of the case. No, I get it. These look great, what did Empress say? They're coming back on Monday for another meeting. I mean, I think we might be able to pull this off. Good, now onto more important things. You got a date tonight for the gala? Everyone's busy. Well, you know there's no harm in going stag. I was thinking about maybe asking Valerie. Valerie who almost lost us a major account in her first week Valerie? I know, yeah yeah, I mean she made a mistake but since then, or even before then, her work's been pretty darn good. What? What? I remember when I really liked Gwen's work. And we've been married what, 10 years now? Whoa, hey, yeah, don't use that word, it's just a date not a proposal. What're you waiting for, hmm? Hey, I was looking for you. Hi, here I am. Are you free tonight? Tonight? I have the day off, so. What? The night, I have the night off. Why, why'd you ask? Well the Marketing Awards Gala is this evening and I was wondering if you'd like to go. As my date. Unless you got? No, I would. - You don't have to. - No, I want to. Unless you don't. No, I do, I definitely do. Yeah okay, so, then I do too. Well it's a date. Okay, great, it's a date. ♪ Letting myself down ♪ - Great. - Okay. ♪ Oh, and I got you ♪ ♪ And I got you on my mind ♪ ♪ And I got you in my head ♪ Joan, we have an emergency. What was I thinking? I mean, I can't go to the gala, right? - I mean, - Why? I, you know, I'm gonna need shoes and a bag and hair and make-up and jewelry and it's just, it's too much. Hello? You would let me borrow something? Well you're gonna give it back. Yeah. No, I can't, I can't do it. I mean, what if I go there and I see somebody that I know, or worse, what if Greg sees that I know no one and then he gets suspicious and then the whole thing. Oh, oh, you're hurting my head. Are you worried about the gala part of the date or the date part of the gala? Oh. What? You're crushing hard. What, no I'm not. So hard Lacey. No, I am not, no, it's not a, no, that's not. That's, it's, that's, I'm not. It's a professional. Crush, it's a crush, it's a crush! It is. God, you're right, I can't but still, it's not, Val can't like Greg, I mean that's crazy. Does Lacey know that? No, how am I supposed to go out on a date with a guy that I have been lying to since we first met. That's how most my relationships start. Joan, be serious. I know, I just think you know what you need to do. No, no, don't say that I have to tell him the truth, please don't say that. Oh, I'm so glad I didn't have to say it. I can't, there's no way, I can't do it. He would hate me, I can't. Lacey, nothing good comes without risks. Besides, who could resist that beautiful face? Not that face, don't do the lip thing, on the date. Just, that one, unresistable. Or irresistible, I don't know what I'm doing. I own a jewelry store or not a library. Okay, okay, what'd I wear? Knock knock. - Hey. - Hey. You look great. Thank you, you ready? Almost, yeah, just waiting on Val. Oh, Val, she's coming? Yeah, I invited her. These awards are for the work we did last year and she wasn't here, so. I know, she's coming as my date. Oh. Oh, that's her now. Hey Val. Hey, I'm downstairs. Everything okay? Yeah, yeah, everything's good, just enjoying the weather. Okay, we'll be right down. Great. All right, let's go. Gosh, this is so exciting. And you look beautiful Cynthia. Oh, thank you, you look stunning. What's wrong, are you okay, what's wrong? I don't have the tickets. Oh no, do I have them, I don't... Did I put 'em... I don't think you, - I don't have 'em. - Where'd I put 'em? Oh no, shoot. I must have left them at the office. Well you know what, maybe you could just talk to security? No, no, they won't let you in without a ticket. Oh. You know what, I'm just gonna run back and grab 'em. Okay, well I'll go with you. - Sure? - Yeah. No, no, no, you can't because by the time you come back, they show's gonna be halfway over, so. I don't think we have any options here. Well, I have a plus one so, Greg, you can come with me? Val, you don't mind do you? No, no, I, yeah, no that's... No no, no, I mind, I'm not leaving my date. - No, no, no, it's okay. - No, no, no. Yeah, well, we have to, you're nominated so. Mikey's nominated, we're just there to clap for him, really, Cynthia, it's okay, you can go in, we'll be fine. - We'll be fine, really. - Okay. I insist, okay. Okay. Bye, have fun! Yeah, you too. I mean come on, we're in the city, we're all dressed up. What are you thinking about going to get some food? Yeah, yeah, I'd love that. Good, I'm starving. I'm sorry about that. I'm actually relieved. Thank you, oh this is so lovely. - It's great. - Yeah, it's perfect. - Perfect. - Yeah, nice. Yeah, should we sit here? Yeah, for sure, we can sit here. Want me to take your jacket? Yes, thank you. There you go. Oh gosh. Oh, oh. Oh, I'm sorry. No, no, that's okay, I can just, you can just. I'll just put it. - Yeah, yeah. - Over here? That's fine, that's fine. - So, here we are. - This is great, yeah. Do you come here a lot? A couple times a week. Oh cool. Yeah, oh, here we go. - Hello. - Thank you. - Thank you. - That's great. Do you like cabernet? Yeah, yeah, whatever, if it says wine on the label, it's good with me, so you pick. Oh, we'll do the 2004, thank you. That was a really good year for me. Was it, oh not for me. Oh. I had bangs that year, not a good year for me. It really wasn't. That's cute, I guess. So I didn't get a chance to say it when I was throwing your coat on the floor, but you look beautiful. Thank you, that's very sweet. You look great as well, I like your. Oh yeah, bow tie? Your bow tie, yeah, looks great. Thought I'd go with it. Looks good, you look very sharp, boss. Oh, you know what, there's no boss tonight. It's just Greg and Valerie, two real people on a date. Yeah. Okay. So, tell me about yourself. Well you know really all there is to know, so, you know. I know you have hidden depths. No. Sorry about that, that was embarrassing. What were you saying? You know, I've been trying tell you that I know we've only been working for what, like a week, now? Yeah. And I already feel like I know you, is that weird? No, I feel that way too. Good, I mean advertising can be so cutthroat, you know? Sure. But you, it's like you're from a different world. I like it, I really like it, 'cause I get to be myself around you. And I just hope you can be yourself around me. Yeah. Greg, I need to tell you. That I think that we should order. Great idea. And I am going to have the chicken parm. Come on, two of those please. Oh were you gonna? That's exactly what I was gonna order. See, it's like we're already on the same wavelength. Yeah, it's kinda like that. Amazing, hey, cheers. Yes. Really, sugarade, now with less lemon. - Yeah, I'm serious. - Wow. I mean Mikey hates that story but I mean, I actually think that was like the first sign of his advertising genius, right? 10 years old and he knew that kids just wanted more sugar in their lemonade. I gotta say, you really really admire your brother. Well, you know, he's the best at what he does, so. Yeah, what about you? Me, what about me? You know, what have you always wanted to be the best at? Is it advertising? Yeah, I mean, yeah, Best of Best is, you know, was my grandfather's, then my grandfather's and my dad's, then my dad's and Mikey's and now Mikey's and mine. So, it's family business, you know. Yeah, it's where I'm supposed to be. What about you? What about me? When did you get into advertising? You know, pretty recently actually. Wow, you've sure got a knack at it, my goodness, I mean, I don't know what we would've done without you on the Empress campaign, so. Oh, fine. No, I'm serious, I'm actually really looking forward to see what you do with the next one. I really think you have a future here. You know, if that's what you want. Greg, I need to tell you something. I have to go. What? I have to go, thank you for everything. Everything all right Mr Best? Hey Bertie, I'm not too sure. So you didn't tell him? No, I didn't tell him. I mean, you don't get it, he was sitting there and he was opening up to me and I felt like a fraud. I felt like a complete fraud and I just, I mean, you were right about me, Joan, this is what I do, right? I get close to something and I put my all and then I just bail and now I can't tell him because it's gonna be even worse than before, so. Lacey, if you don't tell him now, it's only gonna keep getting worse. You think he'll be happier to hear it in a month? Or imagine a year from now? I don't know, you think I could wait that long? No. Why is the right thing do to, so hard? I'm gonna tell him tomorrow. Okay. I'm gonna tell him first thing tomorrow. All right men, we've got terrorists on the rooftop. I want a sniper team in the courtyard, a sniper team in the parking lot and I wanna take the tank, I wanna ram it right through the lobby. That'll get 'em. Hi, can you help me? Sure ma'am, what can I do for ya? I think I locked my keys in my office. Okay, just tell me which one. 101, Valerie Staken. All right, right this way. You know, I thought I left my sandwich in an office once, turns it was in my back pocket the whole time. It was my soup that I left in the office. Oh, wow. I know, I told my wife it was a good thing it wasn't the other way round. What a story. You hear that? Hear what? I think I heard something, it's coming from the supply closet. All right, stay here ma'am, no matter how many shenanigans you hear. There's no sign of... Do you know this woman? Yeah, that's my right hand lady at the security desk. When does she work next? Tomorrow morning, why? I know when shenanigans are afoot. Okay. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Oh, pick up. Hello this is Greg Best, leave a message. Hey Greg, it's me, Val, from your date last night, in case you don't remember. Which you would, obviously, because it was only 12 hours ago, so anyway, just calling 'cause I wanted to talk to you about something, so if you could give me a call back, whenever you have a minute today, that would be awesome. Okay, hope you're having a good day and call me 'cause it's important, thanks. Oh Lacey. What is so important, you had to drag me here on the weekend? Oh trust me Greg, you'll understand. Do you have to move so fast? Come on! It's my one day not to hurry and you're hurrying. Time for a shenanigans sweep. Can you stop running? What are you doing? Come on Greg. Come on. Cynthia, what is it that we're looking for? I don't understand I... You know, whatever it is, it can wait 'til Monday. No, no, no, no, no. Oh! Greg, hi, do you have a minute? Yeah, I'm actually at the office. I, - Greg? - Valerie? Lacey. Valerie, what's going on? Oh no, that's not Valerie, her name is Lacey Keller, building security. I don't understand. Listen, there's been... She lied to us about who she is, what she does, everything. No, I didn't lie about everything. Is this true? Okay, so, I tried to tell you this before. Tried? It's not something you try to tell someone, you just tell them. I never ever meant to... You lied to us. You lied to Empress, you don't know anything about marketing. They liked my idea, You lied about I didn't lie about everything, everything they want. Greg, I'm really sorry, okay? We almost lost an account. It's not what you think, okay. It's just a whole... Please, please don't. No, no, no, Greg listen, - I can explain if you just... - Don't. Please. But I didn't mean to hurt you. Good job. Greg, I. Oh, there you are, did you hear everything? Is it true? Bertie, I... Are you the phantom sleeper? Okay, it's not what it seems like, I promise. The whole time the shenanigans has been right under my nose. No, I was. Lacey I gotta let you go. Ooh. But Bertie, I can honestly. No, you lied to me, you lied to the company, I'm sorry, I have no choice. Honest I can, I can really explain it if you just give me a few minutes. I'm gonna have to take your badge. No, I, okay. Yeah, I get that. I get that, I just. I worked for years building up my reputation and you think you're just gonna step in here? And take it? Goodbye Lacey. I'm really sorry Bertie. Easy there tiger. Why Joan? It's not like I have anywhere to be tomorrow now that I've lost all my jobs and, you know, I'm probably gonna lose my mom's house too, so what's the point? You know, you could come work with me at the store again? Joan, I don't wanna come back to the store. I don't wanna work at the jewelry store, I mean, I wanna have a purpose, a direction and I did and then I just screwed it up, you know, like I do with everything. I don't know what's wrong with me. Lace. And Greg, oh my God, Greg, those eyes. Those big brown heartbroken eyes, I mean he, he's probably never gonna forgive me. You know what, just give it time. I'm sure he'll calm down. I'm not calming down. Greg. Come on man, she lied to me about everything. Everything? Everything. Her name, her job, her name. That's two things. Two's enough. All right, look, what did she say when you talked to her? She didn't say anything. I didn't really give he an opportunity to say anything and I don't plan on it either. Okay, listen to me, you are my brother and I love you, okay? So take this with a grain of salt, but you're being an idiot. Thanks for your support. I mean it, look, at least, what she did was wrong, okay, but... But what? What but, there's no buts, what but? But you need to hear what she has to say otherwise you're not gonna be able to let it go. What about the Empress campaign? What about it? It's all hers! How I'm supposed to pitch it? She's a security guard, man. So what, she's a security guard, it's still a great campaign. Is it really? I don't know because I'm really starting to question myself right now. Okay, take a deep breath, you know why? 'Cause I trust you and I trust that you're gonna make a great decision, about everything, okay? Cynthia, you still got those ideas you were working on for the Empress campaign? Get 'em ready. Yes, I'll get them to the printer right away. Get these to a printer ASAP. I need them for a meeting this afternoon. Sure. I'll be right with you, oh. Oh, it's you. Wait, wait, wait, listen, I'm Lacey, no more scary saleswoman, I promise just a woman who'd really like to help you find the perfect ring. You know, why don't you start by telling me a little bit about your fiancee? Chrissy? She's everything. Yeah, I mean, is she pretty? She's beautiful, she has the most striking blue eyes. They sparkle when she laughs. What else? Well, she's independent, supportive, way smarter than I am. She says the simple things are what matter most. She's perfect. It's gorgeous, the single stone setting speaks for itself, sparkling blue to match her eyes and it's unique, just like... Chrissy. Yep. But, what if it's not the one, what if she's not the one? Listen, I know we don't know each other very well, but in this last week I've learned a lot, and the most important thing I learned, is that you don't wait to say the thing that you need to say, you don't wait to do the thing that you need to do, you just do it. So, do you love her? Do you wanna spend the rest of your life with her? Yes. Then you have to take that risk, otherwise you're just gonna miss out on the best thing that ever happened to you. All right, I'll take it. Ah, I have to go. Wait! Joan will be back really soon. Oh, she's totally gonna say yes. What kinda jewelry store is this? Hey Erin, did you take Cynthia's work over to the printer? I put it on her desk, should I bring it to the conference room? Oh no, thanks, I'll grab it, thank you Erin. And when we're done with the pitch today, I wanna talk to you about your future here. Someone recently brought it to my attention that we've been overlooking your potential. I'd like to change that. Thank you. What? Ah, you got the new prints, everyone's in the conference room ready to go. You sabotaged the presentation? Wait, what're you talking about? You changed them? You changed all of them, I don't understand, you'd risk everything just to mess with Lacey? Oh Greg, enough about Lacey okay? I've worked with you for years, I've earned my position and all of a sudden some security guard comes in here and she's some genius? That's ridiculous. A security guard who's been better at her job than any of us. You're so insecure, you would risk my account just to make her look bad. We're going with her. We can't, we're all ready to pitch my work. Not anymore. Erin, I wanna go with the other mock-ups, I wanna go with Lacey's, thank you. Lacey? Sorry, Bertie, I can't talk right now, I have to do something. Romantic shenanigans. Thanks Erin, right this way. Great job. Sorry to keep you waiting. I wanna talk to you today about an incredible campaign, that we've all been working on for Empress Resorts. I hope this time around it will impress you. Sorry. Empress Resorts offers its guests, an unforgettable experience. The only thing is you and the people that you love. Because, at the end of the day, that's really all that matters, right? It's you and the people that you love because. Because, without you, nothing else matters. And that is what's so beautiful about this campaign. It's not just about your wonderful resort, it's about you living your best life. And without you, it's empty. Well, it looks like the Empress account is in good hands. I'll have business affairs start drawing up the contracts. Thank you, thank you really. Thank you! Wow. Nice work. Nice work to you, we did it. We did! And we did it together. What're you doing here? How did you get in? Ah, blue shirt guy? Can you get her? You're used to keep trespassers out, thank you. Grab her. She's right, we don't allow trespassers in this building, Cynthia, you're fired. But, I. You jeopardized our presentation and you sabotaged her work, you're done here. But you can't handle this project by yourself. Yes, I can, Erin you're promoted. I am? She is? She is. I need to go tell my parents. Bertie? I'll take out the trash for you. Come on ma'am, let's go. Seriously? One foot after the other, let's go. Wow, okay. Well. So you came back? I came back, yeah, I just couldn't leave things the way that they were. Look Greg I know that I lied to you and I'm really sorry but I never lied to you about how I felt about you, how I still feel about you. And I don't expect you to forgive me, I just wanted to tell you that. Okay. Lacey, wait. I realized why it hurt so bad when you lied to me. Because I wanted to believe there was someone out there for me as beautiful and talented and as amazing as you. And now I know that's true. I guess, what I'm trying to say is, do you know any brilliant advertising minds with a little overnight security experience? Aww!
