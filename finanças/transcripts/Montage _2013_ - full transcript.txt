You should come here! Maybe no one's home. Mom... - I'm sorry. - See, - she's alive. - I'll do anything. Please don't... We... came by to tell you something. Any new development? No, it's not that. It's... 15 years flew by real quick. I don't know how to tell you this. The... statute of limitations for Suh-jin's case expires next week. Statute of limitations? What does that mean? When criminal cases reach a set time, no further litigation is possible. The limit is 15 years right now. To expand a little further, memories of the incident tend to fade over time after the crime, and evidence preservation - degrades... - Evidence preservation? Here! Here. here it's all right here. Look, why'd memories fade? Another reason is 15 years is enough time for the defendant to repent and receive absolution for - his crimes... - CHAI Did he ask for forgiveness? Says who? What about me? And my child? What did I tell you? Coming here only adds more stress. I'm stressed. We coulda just sent a notice. We didn't have to come and get pummeled... Det. OH! You promised! You promised me you'd find him! It can't end like this! Hello? It's Det. OH Have you visited the crime scene recently? The crime scene? Why'd I go there? Someone left a flower here. I wondered if it was you - who left it. - A flower? Know of anyone who might... No, only the cops know the location... Hello? Hello? Detective? I'll call you back later. Detective! Detective! July 14 July 14 5 days till expiration of statute of limitations The criminal is careful not to leave prints, but a cop touches the evidence? Without gloves too. I'm just frustrated, that's all. Came back with your prints. OH Chung-ho you're the perp? You shoulda known better. Hey. What? Son of a bitch, he had to piss there? I'll write him a damn ticket! Did we have to come here tonight? Bro! You think he's still here? Watch out, I'll find you! No way... The tire track's very fresh. But only for one. He's back. It's him. So he parks here away from the main road, walks down the hill, comes back up and drives away? Sneaky fuck. 15 years ago, the perp abandoned his stolen van here. The CCTV is here, and where he left the flower. The path where he parked crosses the road, so where did he go next? The flower. He didn't see the cam in the dark. - If he did, - Bro, watch out. he wouldn't have come. Fucking hicks wanna be road kill? You don't own the road, dipshit! - Come'ere, you fuck! - Catch me! Goddamn shit! He definitely drove north. The road is undisturbed for 5km up the river. It's a 15-minute walk from the road to the parked spot. Add another 5 to start the car and reach the road. He was definitely on this road between 1:40 and 1:50 a.m. There's no CCTV here. Find cars with dash cam that drove there. It's a narrow road, so he'll have been recorded. by the oncoming cars. Bro, nice! Does it have a dash cam? I'm calling about your vehicle. - Got a dash cam? - Thank you. Someone left a flower at the spot where she died. Right before the statute of limitations expires! Work your current case! This is my current case! Hot, hot! You can't stop me! OH! Get back here! I'm gonna count to 3! Son of a bitch! Note the difference in degradation of the two tires. The driver side tire is only a month old. Kangwon Police, is this Mr. LIM? Yes, thank you. Do you own a car dash cam? It's for a police investigation. You do? I got it! We found one! Did you note all the oncoming cars? Of course, bro. From 1:40 a.m., it went Kracrusmucagravab... What's that mean? Krados, Cruise, Matiz, Sonata, Musso, Carnival, Grandeus Avante, BMW, in this exact order. What a strange method. Wait. - There were two Carnivals, right? - Yes, I saw it too. Matiz 1328. Then Sonata 2669, almost there. Musso 3876. The first Carnival. Huh? What the heck? I'm with my partner! Wrong number, sir. - I'll get him this time! - We don't deliver. - One more chance! - Get back here, asshole! Sir, wait, wait, please! Dammit! Check the parking lots, I'll cover the used car dealers. We start here, then widen the perimeter. And then this much. There're over 450 Carnivals in Chuncheon alone. It's a needle in a haystack. Man up, asswipe! OH didn't come in today as well? Yes, um, maybe? That son of - a bitch! - Sir, please. Couldn't you let him do his thing until today? Motherfuckers think this is a club house? Show up whenever, huh? New cases are piling up! Wait, wait! Today... is that day... What? July 18 July 18 9 hours till expiration of statute of limitation Bro, where are you? Still at the market? I'll be right there. - Wait for me. - Why the hell for? Go check the garages. Will you just stay put? Welcome. Here's your meal. Enjoy! Two pork soups! Two? Two pork soups! I got it. For one? One more! Got it! Detective, I've been looking all over for you! Excuse me. Here's your meal. 70D-4939, 70D-49309... Fake plate? He used that abandoned car's plate. Sneaky motherfucker! Det. OH He may have gone to other places with the plate. Someone could have seen his face. - Let's go back to the... - We got less than 2 hours. What? Statute of limitations expires in 2 hours. You mean... It's all over. Forget about him now. July 19 July 19 statute of limitations expires Careful, it's hot. Mrs. YOON Ha-kyung Answer it. It's her again? I know you're leaving ‘cos of that case. No, it's not. It sure looks that way. I warned you. Chung-ho, 1 new voice mail it's not right for a cop to be fixated on one case. There's nothing much you can do now. You did your best. Let it go now. I'm sorry, sir. I can't obey this time. Did you ever? You have 1 voice mail First message It's Ha-kyung. I'll get to the point. I need contact info for the following names. It's my final request. Mom! You'll trip, slow down. Hold tight. One, two, hold tight. Stay here I'll be right back. Hello... Hello? Who is this? Mommy! Bom... Reporting, sir. Good work. How is it out there? It's pretty quiet. - Okay, get to it - Yes, sir. KANG, lay off a little. Ah, right. Mr. HAN, don't look around and just walk slowly. And don't look back at us. Just behave naturally. Which swing was Bom's? Great, and where were you? Please move slowly and naturally. Bom. Grandpa! Bom! The suspect may be watching from nearby, So keep a low profile and don't draw attention. I have your child. Hello? Anyone here? Who are you? - Excuse me. - We're closed today. I musta not locked up last night. I heard about an incident here yesterday. It was crazy. Shit, some lunatic came in, and threw my wife on the ground, so she's in the hospital with a serious back injury. Did you see his face by any chance? Of course not, I was in the kitchen. If I did, he'd be in the hospital instead. Would your wife remember him then? He pushed her away so she had no time to react how'd she see his face? Think about it. I gotta find that fuck too, for the hospital bills! Where was he sitting? Right there. My wife was carrying the meal like this! Then, bam! No wonder she got hurt. - Fucking lunatic... - That umbrella... He just took off, so I guess - he left it here. - One sec. Narae Bank Stay calm. All ready? Answer it. Hello? I told you not to call the police. I didn't, I really didn't! Keep this up and you'll never see your kid again. Please believe me. You take me for a sucker? Please, I'm all alone here. Your kid may die because of your lie. Shall I end it here? I'm telling you, I'm alone. Prepare $50,000 in cash by morning, and... I wanna know if Bom is alive. Prove... to me that she's okay. Hello? Hello? It's okay, you did great. Please wait a bit, he'll call right back. Got his location? Almost got him. A few more seconds of the call... - Mrs. HAN, are you okay? - Mrs. HAN, What happened? Snap out of it! Breathe! What happened to her? Gimme that cushion. What the fuck are you? Why wasn't her condition included in the report? She was in shock... Where's the old man? In the playground... Then get him, you moron! Yes, sir. Not that way! What? Where the hell is he? This was given to our VIP clients last year as a souvenir, for placing 1st in the service category. VIP clients? That's right, madam. How many of them are there? Well, at least... What... is this regarding? What time... do you get off work? Pardon? Captain, we got him. What? Where? It's Sungjo Park in Mapo district. Dispatch! Not... a single witness? That place is really isolated, and it's not a park as such. I'm told people don't walk through there. He chose that place for this precise reason. And the pay phone there, prints on receiver and box were wiped clean. Anything else? We sent the recovered hair strand and cigarette bud to the forensics lab. Remember the background noise when the perp called? Honking or traffic noises. The park is far away from a road, so those noises felt out of place. The place's quiet, but it's not vacuum. It's only 300m away from a road. But when we were there, instead of cars, cicada noises drowned out everything else. When the suspect called us, it sounded like he was in the middle of the city. Is the location accurate? Yes, the pay phone record shows a call was made at that time, and the call length matches our recording. Environment sounds don't match up. Listen to the sound of your bullshit. Hey! What's our motto? ‘Evidence trumps everything'. Did you forget? Dig into the finances of the victim's known associates. And KANG, look for similar past cases. A child's life is on the line. If it's not solved in 24 hours, the chance of her coming back alive is halved. Got that? Yes, sir. let me go! Please let me go! This isn't allowed... Thank you so much, I'll tell no one. Please stay calm, and don't do anything hasty or irrational. Don't get sucked into whatever he's saying. Just follow my lead and buy some time. Understand? Got it? Hello? Want the proof that she's alive? Yes. A garbage truck will pass by in 3 minutes. To all units. Check it thoroughly. Get her! Ma'am, you can't leave! Miss? Miss, what are you doing? Are you nuts? Hey, miss! What does it look like? The TV? The wall- paper. Doesn't it look like residential wallpaper? Sir, have you heard of Suh-Jin kidnapping case in '977? - The Suh-Jin case? - Yes. It happened 15 years ago, it's very similar to ours. It happened in the summer, and used a garbage truck to verify the child's safety like us, as well as the military duffle bag method. - Yeah? - Yes. How did it end? It's unsolved, the SOL just expired. And the kid? She died at the scene. The cause of death? I haven't gotten to - that part yet. - Get to it then! It's an old case so only physical copy remains. I'm on my way to the main precinct to check it out. Shit... Found it. What then? Where did it all go? Well. Since the SOL expired, they must've destroyed it. How did those lazy civil servants get to it so fast? We're civies too. So what now? Interviewing the primaries... may be the only way. Wait. OH Chung-ho? Who is it? Who is it? Who the fuck? I'm from the station. You... KANG Chang-sik? Similarities of our cases can't be coincidental. - I was at the archive... - Shit. It's him. What? He chose noon for the exchange. Yongsan station, platform #5, under column #4, $50,000 in a duffle bag. Walk a little slower. Yes, that's good. Place it upright SO we can see it. Stop everyone! Don't let anyone leave! Stop! Shit... He got us good. It's him. Are you sure? No one outside of my team knew about the details, so it could only be him. Okay, let's assume it's him. Then why repeat the same crime? The perfect crime. He got away clean with it once. Captain, it's me. At the time, the exchange was Yongsan at noon. - Yongsan, noon. - Yes, he ordered the ransom in the duffle bag he sent... - In the duffle bag? - Yes. Wait! Hello? Got the duffle bag I sent? $50,000, today at noon, Yongsan station, platform #5, 4th column. Drop it off yourself and walk away. Mister! What happened after you lost him at the station? Goddammit! What the fuck have you got between your ears? These cases are committed out of financial desperation, the marked bills will - pop up soon. - So you'll wait till his shopping spree? Not at all, sir. We've gathered every remaining unit, and posted checkpoints... Forget all that shit! Listen, from here on this is a top secret case. And... Gather enough men without a leak, and put them on the money. - He may call the victim again, - Got it? we should put a few men... Who the fuck said that? Why'd he call there after getting the ransom? Know who's victimized more than anyone else? It's me, motherfuckers! Wait till media gets ahold of this. Useless fucks! Don't sleep, eat or fuck until an arrest! Sir? Got it? Yes, sir. I don't believe this. Det. JO. Yeah? Why are you here? Got orders to pack up and get back. What? Wait, so who's with the mother? No one but a recorder. Mrs. YOON! Mom, I'm sorry. I didn't listen to you. I'm sorry. Suh-Jin, no, it's not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. I'll be there soon, okay? - You didn't do anything wrong. - Mom, I love you! I love you too, sweetie! Hello? Hello? See, she's alive. I'll do anything, just don't hurt my... Thought I'd fall for the fake bills? No, please, I didn't want to trick you. I even withdrew my money! It wasn't my intention! If you followed my instructions, she'd be with you now, - but you screwed it all up. - Please... Please... don't hurt my... - I'll give you one last chance. - What? This is the last exchange. Bring a black plastic bag. Take the Kyungchoon highway, and you'll come to a fork road just past Gapyung. Reset your car odometer to zero. Continue that road for 7km, and you'll reach Hong river. Keep driving straight. The suspect is at Hong river, all units must converge there. We got a report of marked bills at Central Market, there's no one to spare. Screw marked bills! The suspect is here! At 9.5km, you'll see some billboards. When you spot one for a temple, park on the shoulder. Turn off the ignition and lights, except the emergency light. And put the plastic bag over your head. Put your head on the wheel and don't move for anything. Will I... really get Will I... really get Trust me. What happened next? The perp took off with the ransom. He got away with the victim's money? How? The backup didn't arrive in time? And the kid's cause of death? What about motive? Hey, Chung-ho! Enough. Detective OH Chung-ho It's Ha-kyung. I'll get to the point. I need contact info for the following names. It's my final request. CHOI Chang-Jin, 560224-1451090, YOON Jae-ho, 631215... This is train will arrive in Yongsan at noon. If he's using the same method as before, then he'll be on this train. We are approaching West Seoul Station. Please do not leave your belongings. - Go back! - What is it? Captain, we're at West Seoul station. West Seoul? Okay! Goddammit! ETA 2 minutes. Pay phone unit ready. Mrs. HAN, just pretend we're not here, and walk naturally. Place it upright please. Tracker is up and running. This train will arrive at Yongsan station shortly. Please do not leave your belongings. The train is arriving. Stand by. This is our final step, Thank you for using KTX. Excuse Mel! Excuse Mel! ...arriving at platform 6. Thank you. Platform's filled with soldiers. CHOI, report. Dammit, so many soldiers! Let me through! There seems to be a problem. My line of sight is compromised. I can't see it from here either. From the stairwell as well. Roof unit, can you see it? Not here... The bag is moving! What? It's on the move! Which way? I repeat, the bag is mobile. The target is moving! All units, block all exits and stand ground! Where you going? After his escape, we combed the station. So how did he just up and vanished? If my theory is correct, this is it. The tracker is moving to rail #5. Move aside! Move! Split up! It's stopped at rail #5! Which way's rail #57 Move, move! Where's that rail? It's at platform #5! - Keep scanning! - Move aside! Where is he now? The signal is lost! I repeat, the signal is lost! How is that possible? Chang-sik, there! You go that way. Hold still! I got him! What the hell? Leave your phone in the car. Grandpa. Bom, honey? Are you in there? Bom? Grandpa! Grandpa! Open this door, who are you? Let me out! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Not sure how long I was held there. It was dark and I couldn't hear anything, I thought that was the end for me. But then... Wear the uniform and be at the spot programmed in the GPS by 1 1:30. The kid dies, if you're even a second late. Grandpa. Coming? Coming? Please find my grandchild. I'm begging you. Interesting twist. Quite convincing, circumstantial evidence too. Have a smoke. Mr. HAN. You received Bom's message, with the cell found in the black plastic bag? Yes, that's right. Then, where is the cell now? don't have it now. You don't? I threw it away. What? Why? Before the train crossed the Han river, he called again. He said to toss the cell, so I asked about the exchange, he said to swap the bag and throw it over the Northern fence. If I succeed, he'd leave Bom on the other side. And you believed every word? No, when I asked how I can believe him... And he said? He just said "trust me'. Wait, stop. Rewind the feed. Rewind the feed. Yes, sir? Get a search warrant on his home. Detective, over here! What? Check this out, there. A match? On the day of the abduction, she was taken at 10 a.m., and you said you were out at the time, and came back an hour after the abduction. Yes, after hearing from my father, I got back at around 11. But you reported the abduction at 3, that's 5 hours after the crime took place. Here. Why didn't you report right away? father said not to. He said police involvement would complicate things. Why would he say that? He said the abductor will call for sure, and if we comply, we'd get Bom back safely. Jung-yeon! Honey. 'If we comply, we'd get Bom back safely'... Name, HAN Chul. He worked - at Hanchul Elec... - Hansin Electronics. Right, worked there for 20 years... Worked where? Hansin Electronics. Then mention it clearly. He worked at Hansin Electronics. When it went bust during AMF period... I-M-F. I-M-F. He moved south to... run a hog farm with food... Food-and-mouth... Forget it! Outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease forced him to declare bankruptcy. After living in seclusion, he wanted to start a new business, and applied for a special loan but he was rejected repeatedly. And the loan officer was Bom's father? Yes. Then explain it that way. I got it. And the DNA extracted from cigarette found at the pay phone matches HAN Chul's, and his vehicle was seen and his vehicle was seen a Seoul toll gate at midnight. The suspect was said to be held captive at that time, it was an hour before the Polaroid was found in the garbage truck. He also delayed - reporting the crime... - Hold on, why's it - so complicated? - So the toll gate time - and the Polaroid... - Yeah, shut it. You're making it worst. - KANG. - Yes, sir? Make it simpler, got it? Make it easy for the media to digest. Other pieces of evidence are pouring in. As you can see, the abduction was meticulously premeditated, and we conclude that HAN's captivity testimony was to throw off our investigation. - This concludes our press conference. - I have a question. Yes? With this much evidence, the suspect still refuses to confess. What do you make of this? I'll ask again. Where is the kid? Why are you doing this to me? I didn't do it. We all know the truth. Just fess up now. Why don't you believe anything I say? I was forced to follow the abductor's instructions. I'm begging you, detective. Please find the kidnapper. And please find Bom. That poor child... What a pain in the ass. With this much evidence against him, - Delivery! - he still won't budge. - Where should I put these? - Hey! Looks yummy. Let's eat. Enjoy your meal. Dig in while it's hot. Looking at this by itself, he really is the perpetrator. But... What? It's too tidy. The perp wiped the pay phone clean after making the call. But left a cigarette butt at the scene? It could be a subconscious habitual slip-up. By the guy who didn't leave a single print? Think about it. Evidence #5 This isn't identifiable. It was captured at night while the car was speeding. Hardly conclusive. This evidence is inadmissible. And the Polaroid was taken at HAN's house? While he was in captivity, the perp could've taken Bom there for the photo. What's going on here? You pinpointed HAN as suspect too early and ignored other leads. So... we got it all wrong? Did you even check the place where he was held? You believe that shit? He tried to toss the bag over the fence, even after I caught him. Isn't that weird? Let's get one thing straight. Not you, me, I caught him. With my cuffs. All right, fine. So... why did he wipe the prints off the pay phone? If he wore gloves, there won't be any prints. That'd leave prints of other people still on it, and all of them would be declared potential suspects, and considerably slow down the investigation. So why wipe the prints completely and leave the cigarette? This guy is meticulous and intelligent. He's re-enacting the perfect crime from 15 years ago. But he has refined the plan by minimizing his risk. He watched the victim's family closely. And got closer. He used the kid as bait to lock up HAN, and framed him for the abduction. He then contacted the victim like he did before. But... at no risk to himself. By the time we captured HAN at the scene, the perp had already escaped the dragnet. I know how you feel. I admit it, you did all the work, but I cuffed him. You must be jealous of all the glory I'm gonna get. - KANG Chang-sik! - What the fuck man! Must you shit on your own friend's parade? What'll you do if that old man is wrongfully charged, while the real criminal gets away clean? Hello? Anyone home? Anyone home? International Audio Sound analysis, wiretapping This tape is badly damaged. Grandpa! Grandpa! There's something here. See this wavelength? Grandpa! Grandpa! Say ‘grandpa'. Grandpa! Say ‘grandpa'. Grandpa! It's like he's whispering into her ear. It's him. The one I've been looking for. Out of the way! - Get in! - Hurry! A comment please! Where's the child? I've been framed! I didn't do it, I'm innocent! Shut it! Don't you get it? His motive isn't clear. Why kidnap his own grandchild? Money is the main motive behind most of these cases. Clean air in the country must've cleansed your soul. People kill for far less than this nowadays. I know you're not that naive. I found this in the storage where HAN was held. Just like his testimony. There is a voice hidden... Detective. Hospitality wears thin in this part of town. Don't be presumptuous. Because of some weak evidence, you're missing out on a chance to catch the real suspect! Weak evidence, you say? Know your place! You just can't accept your own mistakes from 15 years ago! You said so yourself to KANG, that you wished for a similar case to occur. I won't let you suck my case into your cluster-fuck, and somehow redeem yourself. Get it through your head, this case has no ties to yours. You sought me out because of my case. Due to a few similar traits! I'm getting fed up with you! Shouldn't you at least tell a victim from a suspect? Where is the kid then? You got the man, so where's the kid? We, are presuming that he killed her. Killed her? If the body is not recovered, he knows he can avoid infanticide charge. Probably... buried her in a secluded area. Abduction and infanticide, that's at least 15 years. Listen to yourself! You're accusing him with half-assed evidence. Son of a bitch! - Get him out of my sight! - You're letting the real perp slip through your fingers, - don't you forget that. - Stubborn bastard! Come here. This is half-assed? Voice analysis report HAN's voice matches the pay phone recording. 99.4% chance of match ...swap the bag and throw it over the Northern fence. You take me for a sucker? Voiceprint is like fingerprint, you can't fake it no matter how much you doctor it. How did you do it? What? Did you tamper with it? Hey! Watch your mouth! Det. KANG. Captain is asking for you. Okay. Watch it. What the hell's going on? Remember my old kidnapping case? - What? - Come on, do you? That unsolved case? The one you went nuts over? Still have the recording? Well... Do you have it or not? Depends, I might have it, might not. All right, fine, I'll pay you this time. Check this out. Don't mess with my livelihood. I'm not gonna let you screw me this time. I said I'll pay. Please believe me. You take me for a sucker? Why's... the quality so bad? Is this copy from the original? Why, something wrong? - You take me for a sucker? - So much noise in there. Wait. - 1 didn't, - That's odd. I really didn't! But her voice is normal. The two voices don't balance at all. Even if he used a filter to distort his voice, it doesn't get this bad. Look. See the difference in wavelength height? Why is that? I dunno, I'm just stating the fact. Okay, fine. What are you after? I gotta know if the voice of the suspect from 15 years ago is on this tape. Detective, are you kidding me? The recording could be anywhere, and analyzing it could... $3,000 with overtime, and in advance. - Sir... - Nope. No? Nope, nope. Really no? Really, seriously! Remember the bar I took you to when you came for a visit? You really ripped me off. You were piss-drunk, I dunno if you remember. You're gonna do me like this? Since my livelihood is investigation, I can find your family's - cell numbers in my sleep. - Mr. OH, sir. I actually wanted to test the photo SMS function. You can't do this to me! Chung-ho. Hey! Wake up! I got the results. You got it? How did it come out? Come on already! Conclusive, but it's complicated. Two voices, I mean, four voices were matched. Four? First, I compared this voice with the old recording. The funny thing is, it matched up with the victim, not the suspect. What are you saying? With the child's mother? One more thing. Current and old cases' suspects are a match too. It's a flawless match. Remember how only the suspect's voice was damaged? I looked into the reason behind that first. There was a clicking sound, like a switch, or hitting a plastic of some kind. Listen. What could it be? Doesn't it sound familiar? It's the same sound. Same? As what? It's a playback of the suspect's recording from 15 years ago. What? So the original suspect's recording was used in the current case? Bingo. Hence the terrible quality of the sound. Listen to this. You take me for a sucker? His voice quality is very low when he talks, but the motorcycle sound in the background is clear. Then... It's conclusive. So if a recording was used, why isn't his voice the same as 15 years ago? Because the tape degraded over time. Magnetic tapes degrade immensely in 15 years. Especially with prolonged playback, - the tape stretches even more. - Mom, I'm sorry. See, she's alive. Leave your cell in the car. Say 'grandpa'. Grandpal Mrs. YOON Ha-kyung Answer it. It's Ha-kyung, I'll get to the point. I need contact info for the following names. CHOI Chang-Jin, 560224-1451090, YOON Jae-ho, 631215-1450266, HAN Chul, 5807... Bom! Bad traffic? Grandpa! Do you like grandpa? Is that so? Did you miss me? Grandpa! Mom! Bro, it's CHA, I triangulated her cell. She checked her voice mail last night. It's Pohang city, cape Homi... This was the only way. Do you know what you've done? No matter what I tell you, you won't understand. Right, I can't understand even if I tried. How could you have done this? You of all people? When I saw him laughing, I couldn't hold myself back. I live in so much pain every day, and my baby is still buried in - the cold dirt... - Even so, this isn't right! Why not? They caused me So much pain, why can't I pay them back? Tell me, why can't I? - Maybe I shoulda killed him! - You should have! When I... heard that he was back at it again, I got so worked up. "I'm gonna catch him, this time for sure". After finding his voice on the tape, I knew it was him. - But why you? - What was I supposed to do? Who told me I had 2 hours left? Who told me to forget about the case? I'll look the other way. Leave now, and I'm taking the child. No, you can't! You can't take her, not now, you can't! You're not yourself. No, I'm not and I don't care. Think what you want. But you can't take her away, this isn't the time! Give me some time. Time for what? He hasn't repented for what he did! Shouldn't he pay for what he did 15 years ago? Isn't that justice? You have no idea how I endured the last 15 years. You just have to look the other way for a second. Please! Just till the trial, until he's behind bars! Please let me keep her until then. I'm begging you, please. Please, please... Face-to-face with you at last. Why did you do it? What do you mean? Why commit such a horrid crime? I answered the same thing hundreds of times last night. - I'm the victim of... - 15 years ago. This sketch was based on a deliveryman's testimony, who saw you stealing a van. He was the sole witness. Not even fucking close. No wonder the case went off the rails. Heart defect surgery. I heard it was a success. 12-year old HAN Jung-yeon got a second chance. July 19, it was the start of Bom's mother's second life, but also the anniversary of your new life. But also the last day of your crime's statute of limitations. You lived in a rathole for 15 years and waited for this day to come. - I don't know what... - Shut your mouth! 15 years ago that night, you were driving on the riverside road in a stolen van. Mom! Suh-Jin, Suh-Jin, Suh-Jin, honey, mom's here. I'm here for you. Suh-Jin, please wake up. Sweetie, open your eyes. Do you know how much harm you've caused? How her mother lived for 15 years? When I close my eyes, I can still hear that night. That painful, helpless cry. I watched you place a flower on the road. You bowed your head for a while, were you praying? Or begged for her forgiveness? No, you just wanted to congratulate yourself. Celebrating for coming out of the darkness, and comforting yourself for buying forgiveness with a flower. Fuck that, you can't forgive yourself, and you don't deserve it. How dare you kidnap a child to save your own? Detective, are you married? What? Have you ever raised a child? Ever seen your child on the brink of death from a disease? Desperately holding onto life, but you can't do anything for her, how dare you assume what I felt? Yes, I took that child. And I saved my daughter with the ransom. That woman would've - done the same. - Shut your fucking mouth! I never intended to kill her. If only that bitch listened to me and hadn't run away, she'd be alive! But she screamed and ran! That night, I paid for my sins. I was forgiven that day, the debt is settled. It's all over. Do you want Bom to return home safely? What do you mean? Bom... is with me. Welling up at the first mention of the child? Tears of the victim. This is where I was wrong. You've mistaken yourself for the victim and not the cause of all these cases at the time. We're gonna make a deal. Det. KANG. I just found out where Bom is. I got HAN Chul's full confession, he gave me the location of where the child is. There's a hidden room in the reservoir warehouse, you'll find her there. This court sentences you to 15 years of imprisonment. Suh-Jin, mom's here. YOON Suh-Jin 1990-1997 Bom, let's take a picture. Stand right here.
