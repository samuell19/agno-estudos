(howling) (squeaking) (wind blowing) (groaning) So. It begins. (chanting) Alright, alright, enough. (door squeaks open) (chanting) -Zack: Mom. -Jeffy: Jim. -Zack: Mom. -Jeffy: Dad. (laughing) What are you laughing at? Mom, this really blows. I was going to be in the nationals, I have a girlfriend. You don't have a girlfriend... Well, almost a girlfriend as good as a girlfriend... That's right, you know Zack, it's not the end of the world. You'll make friends in the city... and I'm sure their fencing program is much more advanced than it could ever be here. Zack: But it's not my team. I probably can't even get in this late in the year. Ah, did it ever occur to you to consult me before making this huge decision? Zack: What did you think? You could demolish our lives, and everything would be peachy? Well, I don't mind moving... -Zack: Shut up, Jeffy -Jim: Zack! -Honey... -No, Gail, enough coddling him. Zack, we've given you a pretty free reign so far to let you grow and I see now why that hasn't been so wise. It's given you a serious attitude problem. Dad, no... We're moving for the good of this family and, as to your say in the matter, Dad: frankly, you don't have one. -Zack: Mom? -Gail: He's right, Zack... We're moving regardless. Gail: You might as well make it easy on us. Zack: Yeah, well that's just great. I can't believe this. I never knew you guys were total fascists. Zack! Jim: Let him go, Gail. It's time for him to grow up a bit. May I please be excused? (tense music) (jaunty music) Zack, wait up. Where did I leave my sand? (grunting) No, not there. Ah, that's where that went. (groaning) Grave dust. Grave dust. (spluttering) Grave dust that is not. Grave dust, grave dust and tail of lizard. (whooshing) Suil immale. (metal clanging) Kay: He'll only mess things up for me. Sir Ector: Nonsense! Arthur! Arthur boy, come over here. Yes, father? How'd you like to come with us to London tomorrow, help Kay with his gear? Sir Ector: He'll be knighted Palm Sunday, and he will need some help for the jousts. I can be a page? You do well tomorrow and we'll see... Oh, Father, thank you. Kay, I will not let you down, I promise. (yelling) (chanting) Merchant: Knives, handmade knives, come and buy my handmade knives. Merchant 2: Blankets, beautiful wool blankets. (whinnying) Lovely woodwork! Come and see my lovely woodwork. We are getting too far back, forward. We are getting ahead of ourselves. What to pack? Mix them together, that should do it. Now... (bats squeaking) (whipping) (whipping) You shouldn't sneak up on people like that. Yeah well, you shouldn't try to kill everyone who does. Zack: What do you want, Jeffy? Just leave me alone. Jeffy: Zack, come on, it's not that bad. You'll still have me... Thrilled, I'm sure. Plus, the city will be cool. We can go to all the museums take taxicabs, play basketball. We can play basketball here, goof. Hey, don't call me a goof, yeah? Then leave me alone. -Fine. -Fine. I thought you were leaving. I'm leaving you alone. OK? (Zack sighing) This just... -Blows? -Big time. You know, Jeffy, I like it here. Now I know how things work and... I feel like I was just getting control. I wish... Huh? Wish what? I wish it were a different time... Like when? The time of chivalry. The time when your skill with a sword mattered. Then, things were easier. Everything was easier. Easier how? Zack: Simpler. I mean, everything was black, white and simple. There was honor, and there was evil. Everyone knew what they were fighting for. I'm 15. At 15, I wouldn't have to live my life according to Mom and Dad. Zack: There weren't any corporate takeovers or transfers or moving. Man, I'd be master of my own destiny. Zack: By 15, I... You know, I'd be a page. I'd be a squire by now. What's that? Zac: It's the second step in becoming a knight. First you are a page, right. You know, you do errands for all the knights. Then, you become a squire, you're assigned to one knight. You follow him into battles and you carry his gear. Like a caddy? Yeah. Sort of. Anyway, I'd be, going places, anywhere I wanted. Mom and Dad, they couldn't do anything about it. I'd be a killer knight too. -Fight jousts, rescue damsels... -Damsels? You know... babes. Yeah... babes... I could be one of King Arthurs's knights, fight for honor and peace, sit at the Round Table in Camelot. Now you've lost me. (sighing) Forget it. Get lost. Dad's right. You've got a serious attitude problem. Never mind. I'll go. (whipping) Zack, come on. I didn't mean it. I was just... Zack, wait up. (Morgause chanting) (chanting) (chuckling) It's working! It's working! (laughing) Jeffy: Zack, where are you? (whipping) (bird cawing) It's warm. (panpipes) (plays jaunty tune) (wind blowing) (wind increasing) Jeffy? (bird cawing) (distant screaming) -You recognize that. -The Sword in the stone. Cool. Come on. Get a little closer. "Whose pulleth out this sword of this stone... and anvil is rightwise King born of all England." It's THE sword in THE stone. Give it a tug. You know you want to. (chanting) (chanting continues) (chanting) (chanting) (Zack gasps) No way... My brother! My brother has pulled the sword from the stone! Run, tell everyone, there is a King once again in England! But, wait, wait, I'm not... I didn't... (excited yelling) Why not? Yeah, this is definitely cool. (fanfare) Something's wrong. Something is very, very wrong. Hail King Zackary. Hurray! Hurray! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! How could I forget his stupid sword! Excuse me, excuse me. Stupid. I've never... Stupid... Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me? Pardon me? Pardon me! Thunderation, man, will you move? This is an emergency... Oh, pardon me, sir. Um, what's the ruckus? Somebody's pulled the sword from the stone. England has a king again. Hurray. Hurray. Hurray. Hurray. Arthur, something is terribly wrong. Out of my way, old man. Where are you going with that sword? This is my brother's sword and I have to get it to him at once. But, but... What about the other one? -The one in the square? -What, are you daft? This is my brother's sword. Besides, someone's already pulled the sword from the stone. Now out of my way, you lunatic. This can't be... wait. No, really, it was nothing. Please stand up. Just let me handle everything. Who are you, anyway? I'm your fairy godmother. Good enough for me. Morgause: England has a King! King Zackary! Long live King Zackary! Long live King Zackary! Hurray... Long live King Zackary! This is a fraud. No one king rules England! Certainly not this boy! King Carados, and your fellow kings... Morgause: Uriens, Claudus, Nentres, Agwisanco, will you not swear fealty to the true king of England? We will never serve another king, let alone a fraud. People! We have a king and Excalibur has proven him so! Defend your king! Get him. This way. (horse whinnying) (confused yelling) Leevia. The king is in danger. Stop them. Whoa, whoa, whoa... What was that all about? There was bound to be a little rebellion, I didn't expect it so soon. At least the people didn't buy it. Zack: What uh, what now? Morgause: I know another way out. Come on. Now! Where are they? -Who, sire? -The girl and the boy. Which girl and which boy? The boy who pulled the sword from the stone! -Oh, that one. -Claudus: Yes. -What about him? -Where is he? I don't know, sire. (confused yelling) Man: Where are you going you fools? We must go home, Claudus: and come back more sufficiently prepared. We must gather the armies. Out the back. Come, to the castle. (Medieval music) Not too shabby. You will forgive my brother, he is yet unfamiliar with the niceties of being king. They cannot eat until you do. Oh. Let's see about a fork. Eat something. Mmm... (clearing throat) You may begin. (drink being poured) No, thanks. Zack: I mean, I'm trying to cut back. Do you have any... let's see, what do you people drink here? Mead. May I have some mead? (Zack chuckling) Zack: Gross. Yeah, Martha Stewart would not be pleased. I can't believe this worked. What worked? Mead. Zack: Thank you. This castle is known for the excellence of its mead, sir. Um, yes, I can see that. Don't you people drink anything but alcohol? How about some uh, milk? Zack: You know, leche , comes from a cow. It does the body good. His Majesty would like some milk. Please be good enough to fetch it for him. Aide: Of course. So where is the suckling pig? There's always supposed to be nice juicy pigs here... Zack: Big old apple in their mouths. Whatever. Okay. So, what worked? Don't worry. You'll know soon enough... Morgause: In the meantime, Gwynneth will do nicely as your handmaid. There she is at the foot of the table waving. Does it get any warmer here? What do you want? It is a castle. You want a cozy cottage go back to being a peasant. Drink some mead, it'll warm you up. No, thanks. I was thinking that after the coronation, we should have a banquet. A banquet? What is this? Morgause: This is just supper. Zack: Will there be roast pig? Morgause: You are the strangest boy. I'm not a boy. How old are you? Do they ever clean the floors in here? They just cleaned it last month besides it won't be Autumn cleaning for a while yet. I was thinking that I should be the one to appoint the guards too. Morgause: I'm an excellent judge of character. But who are you, really? I told you, I'm your fairy... Godmother... Yes. I know. That really clears things up for me. I am called Maeve, by those that know me. Zack: So Maeve, tell me why am I going along with you being my sister? Because I made you king. Hey, I don't know where you were at the time but I was the one who pulled the sword from the stone... Zack: Why should I take orders from you? Because I am the one who made it happen. Okay... But tomorrow... more jousts... Real jousts? Morgause: We can start choosing knights for your court. Now, it is time for you to go to bed. Gwynneth! Will you be kind and show King Zackary to his bed chambers? Yes, madam, it would be my pleasure. Now then, Your Majesty, shall we? Oh, yeah... This is sweet. (distant music) (music getting louder) (Gwynneth gasping) I think you're not quite ready for that yet. What was that terrible contraption? Uh, it's a CD player. Pop in a CD and press play. The music goes up in to the ear phones. It's a piece of magic I brought from my home. Well, I hope you will feel comfortable making this your home, Your Majesty. Please... just call me Zack. Ooooh... isn't he just the sweetest little King, he wants me to call him a nickname. Okay, Zack it is. But only in private. In front of everyone else, it's Your Majesty. We don't want anyone thinking that I've overstepped my station. What are you doing? I'm just getting you ready for bed, dearie. Don't squirm so... Well, stop it... That's a royal order! Gwynneth... I'm sorry. No, I can undress myself, it's okay. Why don't you just go to bed. Everything is fine. It's cool. I'm good, okay? -OK. -Good night. -Good night. -Good night. -Good night. -Goodbye. Zack: You're not sleeping in here? I am your handmaid, sir. I must be at your side at all times. I don't think so... It's your sister's orders, Your Majesty. Well I order differently... She is still older than you, sir, and until the coronation I must do as she says. Okay, okay. Whatever. Good night. (thunder) Zack: Oh, man. Either I'm having one messed up dream or I have gone completely round the bend insane. Gwynneth: Pardon me, Your Majesty? Good night, Gwynneth. Put me on... Sure. Okay... (whooshing) Zack: Whoa. I'm invisible. Zack: Quick! Hide! It goes well, my darling. Well, Miss Maeve. Miss Morgause. Lady Morgause. Queen Morgause. (chuckling) This was so much easier than I thought it would be. Now let's just get that brat crowned before Merlin can interfere. (intense music) (howling) Good. Good work. At least I think so. Boy, are you out there or not? Zack: Right here. Merlin: Well, thundering typhoons, boy, take off the cloak so I can see you. Merlin: Get inside. Come in here, boy. We have things to discuss. Are you... are you... Tired? Angry? Are you Merlin the magician? What gave me away, the cloak of invisibility or was it the beard? Oh, Merlin... Mr. Merlin... man, I am very pleased to meet you, I am a big fan. Yes, and the boy who has muddled things terribly. You know, one thing's bothered me though. If you could see in the future then, why can't you fix things? I mean couldn't you make things go better for Arthur? Will you please just be quiet? I mean just listen to yourself. This is great. I can't believe I am actually standing here talking to Merlin. lf I'm king here, you could be my advisor, right? Oh, I give up. I mean, I don't know exactly what I'm doing here. That much is apparent. Now, silence. (mumbling) Merlin: What I can't understand is how anyone could change destiny. Don't bother. Merlin: You see, my boy. Everything that will happen has already happened, in a way. You see, my boy, it is all a matter of destiny. I have mine, you have yours, and Arthur has his. Except the tricky bit now is that Arthur no longer has his, thanks to you. Merlin: Do you understand what I am saying here? Your pulling the sword from that stone has altered the course of all history. Not even I can predict what will happen now. No, this is not a dream. This is a very harsh and terrible reality. And I don't know how it happened. But there we are. Our challenge now is to set things back on track. Merlin: First of all, how did you pull that sword from that stone? What kind of sorcerer are you? (frustrated mumbling) Merlin: You must have had help. And very powerful help indeed. Would that we all could change destiny. I wouldn't have to spend eight centuries locked in an oak and Arthur, well... Arthur definitely deserves an easier fate. Don't you think I'd do something if I could? Well. just take it off boy. (sarcastic chuckling) Thank you. -Now... -Now, first of all, I did not do this, alright? Zack: Enough already. Will you let me finish? There is this bitter, bossy, freaky chick who actually turns out to be Morgause. Yeah, that's right, Arthur's half sister who later screws him over and well, you know the rest of the story better than I do. Anyway, the chick is like totally psyched to get me crowned this Sunday, I don't know, supposed to make this whole mess stick or something like that. Very clever. Yeah, well. Anyway secondly... Zack: I am totally sorry about this like, major disaster I seem to have caused here... If I knew what was going on I'd have left that stupid sword in the stone for Arthur to pull out. Those things are heavy anyway, I don't know how they fight with them. Thirdly, if you are supposed to knew the future, well, dude, why didn't you see this coming? Because destiny has been changed. Because destiny has been changed. I don't know what will happen next. I don't know what will happen next. Oh, dear. Morgause. I mean, who would've thought it? I mean, she's only a girl yet. How can she have the power? We are in a great deal of trouble here. You see, my boy, anything in good magic, that is magic that works at one with nature, has the power to change destiny or history That applies to the past as well as the future. Only very particular forces of evil can interfere. Morgause is too young to have these powers unless she got a hold of the Dark Book . The what book? The Dark Book. It's a very ancient book indeed. Merlin: It holds such powers of evil that it was banished to a forgotten place by a very wise wizard hundreds of years ago. Merlin: Now, we've got to get you back to the castle before she suspects. Tomorrow we will get a hold of Arthur... Merlin: And we must, we have very little time. What happens if I am crowned? If you're crowned, you'll be crowned in front of most of London. Restoring Arthur to the throne after that would be near impossible. And I couldn't get back home? You'd be too busy ruling England, my boy. We can't have you just disappearing... Who could succeed after a scandal like that? Arthur'd be accused of murder before they'd let him take the throne. Look, I've obviously screwed things up here like it or not. Zack: I will stick around and I'll help as best as I can. How generous. And when things are all fixed, I'll go home. Zack: You can send me home? There, this should do it. What are we gonna do when we find Arthur? Help him to regain his destiny. Now, goodnight. Now, keep your eyes open for an ancient book you'll know it when you see it. And if you do find it, bring it to me. Okay, but... back to the getting me home thing... Zack: You can get me home, right? I mean, I have a fencing tournament next week... Zack: I have things to do... (echoing) I certainly hope so, my boy but I don't quite see how. Zack: Not to mention... (gasping) (chuckling) Nice seeing you, Merlin. OK, I help him out, he sends me home. That's easy enough. I mean, he is Merlin after all, right? Yeah... (bird cawing loudly) Now... to practice. I master this book and I won't need any pesky kid to help me rule the land. Invisibility. Love potions. Aaaah... the Spell of the Making. (chanting) (screeching) We'll leave that one until later. Here is an easy one. Wind. (chanting) (wind blowing, chanting) (gasping) (chanting) Important lesson number one. Learn the undoing of a spell before the doing of one. (rooster calling) (birds tweeting) Get up, you sleepyhead, there are things to do. I wasn't dreaming. Now, I've laid out your clothes as you seem to hate to be dressed, and I'll wait behind the curtain until you do. It's freezing in here. All the more reason to get dressed. Can I take a shower? A what? Bathe myself... maybe wash my face or brush my teeth. Why, dearie, it's a long way until Saturday, Gwynneth: and Saturday's bath day in this castle As for your teeth, you're young yet. They won't be giving you trouble for years. Well. (mumbling) Ew... I think I will go for a ride this morning. You have things to tend to here. And I'll go for a ride. You are needed at the castle today, sire. Why don't you back off for the morning, Maeve. I am going for a ride and if you don't like that Zack: I'll have to raise such a stink that... Listen, you little... I will be back in a few hours. I promise. All right, then you may go. But be back by three bells. There will be jousts to watch. Then I'll back. Thanks, Maeve. Cassian, will you take His Majesty for a ride today? Cassian: Yes, ma'am. (horse whinnying) Cassian: I think Ginny will do well, Your Majesty... She's strong and fast and gentle as a lamb. Very nice. Cassian, could you...well I've never really ridden before. Never ridden, Your Majesty? My family lives in... Uh... We grew up very poor. Zack: The only horse on our farm was a workhorse. Of course, Your Majesty. I forget that you grew up as one of us. So, first thing to remember. Always the mount from the left. OK. Cassian: Whose horse is this? I've not seen him before. Yeah, he's a beaut. Yeah, I think I'll take this horse. Cassian: But I am not sure to whom it belongs. I will ride this horse. Yes, Your Majesty. -Whoa! -Cassian: Sire! Oh, great, Cassian. Lose the king... Merlin: Well, don't I get a good morning at least? Merlin? I thought you sent me the horse or something. Where are we going? Patience, you'll see soon enough. -Merlin? -What now? How can you see the future? You really want to know that? -Yeah. -It doesn't interest you in the least that I can shift my shape into animals? It does, but I dunno the whole future thing interests me. It's what made you so useful to Arthur. Listen well, I am only going to explain this once. For me, what's hard is seeing the past, not the future. You've lost me already. I had the ill fortune to be put onto this earth living backwards. So seeing the future is no trick as it is really my past. It is remembering what happened yesterday that gets me all befuddled. Then why do you walk and talk forwards? Don't get all technical on me, boy. It is what it is. Ah! Remind me never to do that one again. Oh, my poor old bones. That was awesome. Well, gee golly whillikers aren't we having so much fun. Come on, my boy, we have work to do. I went to Arthur to try to explain he won't have any of it. He doesn't believe me. Did you find that book? I haven't had the chance to look yet. Well, that's just wonderful. Why not put it off another day let the entire country wither under a reign of evil. It'll be hard enough getting him on the throne, I can't do it without his help. We've only got four days before the entire kingdom recognizes you as its King. Zack: What do we do about those who already think I am king? I'm working on that, my boy. All right, well, I'll just go to Arthur and convince him. Of course you can accomplish so much more than feeble old Merlin impudent pipsqueak. He'll be king and I'll be home by Sunday but not before some jousts. (horse grunting) Arthur: It was just one stupid mistake, I had all that other stuff to carry. So what if I forgot the stupid sword? I got it to him in time for the joust, didn't I? You know, if Kay weren't such a pig, Arthur: I'd be a full page by now. Now let me do the talking. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Arthur: Instead I'm cleaning up after you and all your friends all afternoon when I should be out training. Oh, it's you again. Why don't you go away? You crazy old man. I'm busy. A little more gently, please. You have no idea how sensitive the back gets around the saddle. What would you know? Trust me, I know. Arthur. Hi, man, it's so cool to meet you I just wish things weren't so crazy -Who are you? -I am Zack. I'm the guy who kinda screwed things up. What things? I pulled the sword from the stone. Oh, Your Majesty. I'm sorry, I didn't know you'd be so young. I am just a teenager like yourself. Get up, already. I should bow for you. What do you mean? You were supposed to be the guy who... Oh, please don't tell me you've been listening to this old man. He's crazy. No, a little tense maybe, but not crazy. But look I understand, things are a little loco here. But trust me, he's a powerful wizard he will your advisor and you'll be king. You are insane, you're both completely insane. See, there is bad mojo involved here. and your sister actually... Zackary, let's not divulge. I don't have any sister. You do, you just don't know about it yet, all right? Sir Ector is not your real dad. Now you are talking as crazy as the old man. Ector is my father. Kay is my brother. It's that simple. I've got a lot of work to do between now and supper. I'll get it for sure if it doesn't get done. So, excuse me, Your Majesty. You gotta listen to me, man. We don't have much time. Kay! Kay, come here I need your help. I think, we better go. But he's not hearing me Come on, Zackary, let's go. It's enough for today. (magical whooshing) What? What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. (eerie music) An enslaving spell. This is just what I need. Man, I wish I had that invisible thing now. (door creaking) Right on. This castle is phat! (Morgause chanting in distance) (chanting getting louder) (chanting) (chanting) We are under thy power. Morgause: Now... listen carefully. You are now my servants. You must do anything I say. Understand that I am your Queen. Your Majesty. Oh, really, you are too much. Your reign is supreme. Thank you, that is enough. Now, your assignment is to keep an eye on that little brat King Zackary. Little brat Zackary. Of course you mustn't call him that. You must just call him "Your Majesty." Guards: My majesty. No. No, no, no. Your Majesty. -Guards: Your Majesty. -Morgause: Right. Guards: Right, Your Majesty. Now that really is sweet. Morgause: You must just call me the Lady Maeve. Your Majesty, the Lady Maeve. No, you idiots. Listen carefully. I am the Lady Maeve. Morgause: You must call me "My Lady". Zackary is the King... Morgause: At least until I can think of a better use for him. You must call him... Your Majesty. Get it? Guards: Your Lady, My Majesty. Reverse that. -My Lady, Your Majesty. -Right. Now you are to follow His Majesty, King Zackary, and report back to me everything that he does. Guards: Report everything back to you. (metal clanging) What are you doing here? Oh, Maeve... you scared me. What are you doing here? And where is Gwynneth? I just found all this cool armor, man. Those jousts were awesome. Think I can compete one day? Morgause: Honestly. You'd think you were just a child not a king. Go to bed. Pushy much? I am not in the mood for any of your... Maeve, we're going to be working together for a little while, right? If you'd just chill, just a little bit, things would go much easier for both of us. I need you to get your rest Zackary... Tomorrow we are giving audience. Really? Who to? To whom. Morgause: To some of your subjects... We have important business to attend to. The country can't just sit around waiting for you to be crowned. OK, I don't know anything about-- Don't worry your little head, I'll take care of things. Goodnight, Zackary. Tomorrow you get to sit in the throne room. Throne room, cool enough. I don't understand your constant desire for it to be chilly when you're always complaining about the cold. No, cool doesn't mean-- Never mind. Just go to bed. No, no, no. Remember your attitude. Good night, Zackary. Merlin: Zackary. Zack. Merlin: Wake up, my boy. Zackary. You talk. What gives? Merlin: Of course I talk. It's Merlin. -Merlin? -Now be quiet, or you'll wake that dreadful woman. What are you doing here? I spoke to Arthur again. I even did a few tricks to convince him, he's not biting. Go to Ector's place and talk to him today. It won't work. We already tried. He won't listen to me. Besides, just let him cool off. I saw some jousts yesterday and today I got to hold court. How can you? How? Do you think this is a game? We have three days left. If Arthur is wigging out about the news, I may as well look around. The stuff here is wild. Of all the... Look, if you let me hold court today, I'll go see him this afternoon. You think you can bargain with me? -You little pipsqueak -Hey... by the way, I think you were right. Morgause has the Dark Book. It's this ancient looking thing, even for today, Zack: and it glows red. That's it. Did you get it? Like things would be that easy. No, she's got it locked up somewhere. The key's on her belt. Merlin: Boy, listen to me. I need you to listen. Someone's coming, hang on. (Merlin mumbling) What, in bed so late? Gwynneth. Gwynneth, where are you? Gwynneth: I'm sorry. What time is it? Past sun up, you fool. Now get the boy dressed meet me in the throne room in haste. Relax, man. Don't to freak out on her, she didn't do anything. And you are going to be quiet today, boy. We have important affairs to attend to and I don't need you fouling them up. You gonna make me? You aren't making things any easier with that temper of yours. Are you ready? Straighten your coat. Even with the fire in here, it's always like the Arctic. Stop whining. Why can't I sit on the throne? You're not crowned yet. Then why are we giving audience? Some things can't wait. Enough with the questions. If anyone asks anything confer with me first, -I will tell you what to say. -Whatever. And sit up straight, you're supposed to be a king. Whatever. We may proceed. I said I wanted to see the king. Young Man: This is the king. They said he was young but I never thought... Zack: What seems to be the problem? This young whippersnapper-- Excuse me, um... Your Majesty. If I may speak. There he goes again, always interrupting. You go first. And you, old man, will get your turn after. Your Majesty, I am your humble servant the Duke of St. Ives and I have recently inherited lands. Duke of Ives: On surveying these lands, I found this old man. He claims that the land belongs to him. But can't seem to offer any evidence except his stubborn rantings. Duke: Since I have approached him about leaving my land, four of my cows have gone missing, and one of my pigs was left slaughtered on my door step. Uh-huh... (Morgause whispering) Zack: What? You heard me, now tell him. But we don't... we haven't even heard the old man yet. Morgause: I don't care. Cattle theft is a hanging offense, and the old man must die. I don't know what kind of world you grew up in, but where I come from, people are innocent until proven guilty. Zack: All right, here's the deal. Old man, you give him back his cattle and buy him a new pig. And, you give him half of your crop as rent. Rent? Zack: He stays on your land for life only if he gives you half his crops. That way that part of your land will be upkept and maintained, Zack: and you will get your stuff back as a reward. Zackary... Zack: The King has spoken. Zack: Now get out of here before I change my mind. Thank you. Now you listen to me. (chanting) I'm not listening, not listening! (Zack singing tunelessly) You may approach. Your Majesty. I am King Bans, this is my brother Bers. Oh, no, not more kings... We come to swear fealty to you and your kingdom. Oh... We also come to warn you that six kings to the north, they have all banded armies together, King Bans: and have vowed to conquer you. Well, uh... We need to know your plan of action. Uh... when are they going to attack? Bans: It is five days journey from their country. Uh... W... I'll think about this tonight and let you know tomorrow. I can't deal with this. Well, you won't have to. I will. You can't deal with this either. Silence. Now, that will be enough for today. If we go to war in four days, maybe by that time I can... Go to your room. I don't want to see you until supper. My pleasure. (mouse squeaking) Merlin. Where have you been? (Merlin clearing throat) Oh... Sorry. I thought you were having such a good time being king. I can't... I can't do this Merlin. We have to get Arthur back in power. -There's going to be a war. -Merlin: I know that. I mean, how can they possibly... How could they even think I... How did Arthur handle this? Like a young and overwhelmed boy, trying to do a king's job. But Bans and Bers help. This is his first trial. Was his first trial. Come on, we haven't a minute to spare. We've gotta talk to Arthur. I've got the key, but Morgause is in the room with the book... Well done, my boy. Look, we have no time here. Just do your zappy thing and I'm outta here. Very well. Oh, but one more thing. What? Don't say anything to Arthur about Guinevere and Lancelot or Mordred. He'll find out about those things in due time. Merlin: And don't mention the war. Now... (zapping) Carados: I didn't hear you ride up. Now get out of my way. I'm busy. Merlin: Go after him, boy. What's all this stuff? I'm practicing. Arthur: It looks like you could use some practice yourself. Listen, man, we gotta talk alright. Zack: There's going to be a... You've just got to be king. It's just not for me. Please, don't start that again. (galloping) (metal clanging) Uh, nice try. You broke my concentration... Whatever. Look, like I said, man, we gotta have words. Zack: Arthur, man, I'm not supposed to be here... I was brought back in time with bad mojo by that freaky chick and placed on the throne... Arthur: Did you see that? That was great. Yeah... Arthur: Imagine what I could do on a real horse... Yeah, but, we have to talk... Will you take a hint? Look, I know you're king, or whatever you are, but I've only got an hour before now and chores. And I've a lot of exercises to do before then. Don't you get it? It you'd just stop with this chores stuff for a minute and listen to me, Arthur... if you don't wake up and fast and take your place on the throne, I'm not get getting home. Where is home? America. Arthur: America, what country is that in? It's a place you people haven't discovered yet. Across the ocean. Whatever... Anyway, I did not choose to come here... I was brought here. I have a family, a brother and parents who I... Who I miss. I mean, I really miss them. And I've got my own path to follow I don't know what that is right now, but I do know that this, this is totally messed. I can't help you... Come on Daisy, come on, not now, come on. All right, all right, whoa. Arthur: It's all right, Daisy. You can't help being so old. (Merlin mumbling "gently please") What now? Why won't you listen? You are supposed to be a king, not some stupid lamo chore-hopping, Zack: pretend-to-be knight who talks to his stupid horse. Oh my, what is this? You want a piece of me? Do you? Is that it? All right. let me just accommodate your wishes there, Arthur. Let's see that you got. Whoa, all right, two hands. Okay, this isn't fencing. Let's boogie. (swords clattering, grunting) (grunting) (Arthur chuckling) You do talk oddly. You really from the future? Zack: Yeah. Arthur: How far ahead? What year is it now? We are in the year of our Lord, 486. So from about... 1,500 years into the future. What is it like then? You obviously still fight with swords. This is just for play, not for real, you know. Well, then there's no war. Oh, no, there's war. There will always be plenty of war. Just a different kind of weapons, you know. Is there war still in England? No. But that's mostly because of you. What else? Well, there is communication between all the world. People can talk to each other from anywhere. How is this possible? Computers. Telecommunications. Telephones. Basically a different kind of magic... Well then, how can there be war with all of this new magic? I don't know, there just is. How can there be war in your world, with all the magic? I see your point. I don't know man. It's screwy, but it's home right? It's where I belong. Like you belong on the throne. I don't know about being king. I want to be a knight. It you become king, when you become king, you will lead hundreds of knights into glorious battles. You are single-handedly responsible for ending conflict with all the tribes in England. You're gonna be the best king ever. I promise. What would I do? I don't know the first thing about ruling a kingdom. You'll figure it out. Merlin will be there to help. The old man? The very with it old man. He is a powerful wizard. How do I know you're not under some spell? Arthur: Or he's not trying to trick me or manipulate me like that witch did you? He's a good magician and he'll be your best bud and advisor. I can't take all this in, I have to do my exercises. We only have two days until I have to be crowned I mean it'll be pretty scary if you don't get it together. You're gonna be a good king, Arthur. I'll think on it. Oh, can I ask a favor? Nice, Merlin, getting down. Thank you, Your Majesty. Stop that. Call me Zack. But you... Hey, that's an order. I'd best be getting back. I have chores to do. Listen, please, come back with me to the castle. Let's work things out, all right? I need more time. Zack: We don't have more time. Merlin: Get off my back, you ungrateful sack of potatoes! Alright, alright. You are going to be the jewel of the coronation. Now, to work. The Spell of the Making rears its beastly head. (chuckling) Really, Morgause, you are too much! But not yet, not yet. I must learn more first. But once I am ready to read that spell I can dispense with the gathering of armies, I will have England under my thumb and I can ditch the boy. Now... The spell of Second Sight. Let's see what goes on with Merlin. Poor Merlin, no Arthur to advise. (chanting) Zack: I will practice riding. OK, I promise. Merlin: I have no intention of letting you ride me again. My boy, it is back to the castle for you 'til Arthur comes to his senses. Besides, I need you to get that book. You have the key, the rest should be easy. Zack: Is that book really that dangerous? My boy, if she can wreak such havoc with only a few of its simpler spells, you don't want to know what she can do if she ever figures out the Spell of the Making. The spell of... What's that? A very dangerous spell which would make her far more dangerous to this country than merely a little junior witch and she could do far worse Merlin: damage than merely changing history. Zack: How? Never mind, just get that book. We'll try again with Arthur tomorrow. Alright, but how about letting me ride you back? I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that. (zapping) (groaning) Riding sure does hurt. Morgause: So does the truth. Morg... Maeve. No need for the charade any longer, "little brother". I know what you know and where you've been. The Dark Book is not without its powers of second sight. You see, I was listening. Morgause: Key please. Zack: What key? (ominous music) You won't get your hands on that book. Morgause: I'm not about to let a simple, stupid boy ruin my chances. You choose me because you thought I wouldn't cause as many problems as Arthur. So maybe it does have a brain after all. Okay, but why me? Morgause: I have the power to pull people out of time, but they have to want to come, just a little bit. And I guess I wanted to come more than just a little bit. Why not use someone from this time? Harder to track the lineage of one who comes out of the air. Morgause: They have no choice but to believe you are the long lost son of Uther Pendragon. Yeah, but Merlin... I am dealing with one problem at a time here. I already have a fool on the throne, I'd say I am doing quite well, wouldn't you? Aside from the fact that you took it upon yourself to tell my idiot brother the truth. You can't just change the future. Nothing good can come of it. You're starting to sound like Merlin himself. Well, my boy, until I can think of something better to do with you, you are now under house arrest. House arrest, now how you gonna do that? Well, I think I'll kill you with a little kindness first, while I kill my other brother a little more completely. Gwynneth: Your Majesty, Lady Maeve told me you've taken ill. Oh, no, what are you doing out of bed? Now let's get you to bed and give you a poultice. Then we'll bank the fires and get it warm in here. Morgause: And now, to dispose of my other problem altogether. Zack: Gwynneth, stop it. She's going to kill Arthur. Witch, who? You are getting delirious. This will make you feel better. Zack: Merlin!! (Gwynneth snoring) Uh, hiya. Morgause: Quickly to Sir Ector's castle. You will find the traitor in the barn tonight, or so the Book tells me. Shackle him as quietly as you can and report back to me. No. No, no no. This can't happen. Merlin. Merlin. Merlin, I need you. (Merlin grunting) Merlin? Merlin? Is that you? (grunting) Dude, where have you been? Morgause just sent her drones out to kill Arthur. Why? She knows I know and that you know I know and Arthur knows... Oh no. Oh my goodness, what was that? -What? -Gwynneth: That flash of light. Oh, Gwynneth, don't tell me you've got it too. No, of course not. Oh, Gwynneth, you don't look so good... What, well, I am feeling a little bit off. You know what you should do? Go to bed, I did and I feel so much better because of it. But Lady Maeve said to keep an eye on you-- Don't worry about that, I'm going back to bed now, you must do the same. -Gwynneth! -Gwynneth: What? -Look at that! -What? You're flushed. Ooooh, I am feeling a little bit dizzy. Yeah, you know what you need? A lot of this, come, you need to get to bed. -Let's go. -Yes. Yes. A lot of this. Generous portions. Good. (zapping) Why did you bring him here? Gwynneth: Are you all right, Your Majesty? -Beca-- -Gwynneth, fine. Good. Take us somewhere we can talk. (zapping) I don't like this... I said I'd think on it. I'm still thinking. Why did you bring us here? She's sure to find him. The best place to hide is in plain sight... Why does this witch woman want me dead? Put the bucket down and be quiet, both of you, I need to think. Arthur, this belongs to you. I didn't feel right with it. (mystical twinkling) Zack: Whoa... Of course... Excalibur. Excalibur. So, you believe me now? Yeah. Wow. Huh. Zack Yeah. Huh. Wow. Let's go back to the king's English... Merlin: Or it would be the king's English, if... Merlin: Now, what to do? Zack: I say we take on whatever's coming. Wait a minute, boy. Merlin: We need to fight together in this battle. We've each got our strengths, but if you will permit me a little intervention, I've got a little extra help for you. (zapping) Beauty. (whooshing) Zack: Oh yeah, I'm invisible! Stop it fool, or I'll turn you into a mouse and Arthur and I will take on the enemy alone. Get it? -Zack: Got it. -Merlin: Good. Merlin: Now, you got Excalibur. As for me... Now, men, let us to battle. Hidden in plain sight my eye, Merlin. Do you think my magic so primitive it cannot see danger when it approaches? Primitive is exactly the right word for it. Primitive and dangerous. (zapping) Where did they go? Zack: I don't know. Uh-oh! Yeah... (zapping) You little trick. But I think you'll find my powers have come a long way in a very short time. (Morgause chanting) (chanting continues) Agile for such an old man. Come on and fight me. Come on, out with the lightning, I can take it. My dear, you have obviously missed the point of all of your magic lessons. You think all of this carries no price? Morgause: Come on and fight me! Let's see who is the real magician. (Merlin chanting) (Morgause chanting) (Morgause groaning) (swords clashing, grunting) Zack! Ah! (grunting, groaning) Zack: Hey, guardy guards. Over here. Yo, zombie freaks. All right, you get round one. But I am not finished yet. No, you are far from finished. There is much more havoc you must wreak in your lifetime. -Stop that. -Stop what? That future stuff. Like you know it all. You thought you knew about Arthur, Morgause: and then look what happened. No, well. Just because you managed to move things around a little bit doesn't mean... Merlin: they won't come to the same sorry end. Now, what's next, my dear little witch? I am not a witch. I am a magician! What have you got for me? (Morgause chanting) (Merlin laughing) Oops... (Morgause screaming) (Merlin laughing) (screaming) (gasping, grunting) (grunting, groaning) Zack: Oh, yeah, the mark of Zack. (high-pitched grunting) (high-pitched grunting) (manic laughter) (terrified gasping) (grunting) (yelling) (clattering) (groaning) Zack: Could you watch where you're going? What happened to the guards who were after you? I took them out, no problemo. And your guards? I had no problemos either. Good, stay where I can see you. It's difficult having a comrade you can't see. It does have it's advantages though, huh? (Merlin grunting) That's Merlin. Let's go. It doesn't sound good. (growling, cackling) Yaaaaa! (groaning) All right. (laughter, screaming) Arthur: Thank you. (grunting) Zack don't need no cloak. (yelling) Zack! Say hello to my little friend. Guard: Whoa, aaah, gah! Zack: That's gotta hurt. Good work. You didn't do too bad yourself. -I said you had it in you. -Yeah, let's get to Merlin. Why don't you fight me? Because I need you alive, you idiot girl. You have things to do. You bet I have things to do. You bet I do. I have big things to do. You leave me no choice, Merlin. You have given me no choice but to forge on. Morgause, you don't know what you are dealing with. (screeching) (Morgause chanting) Morgause, it's too powerful for you, it will kill you. I think I've mastered this book by now... Merlin: No one is the master of that book, it can only master you. (chanting) Merlin: Morgause! (Morgause chanting) (chanting continues) (chanting intensifies) Yah! Nooooo! (whooshing) Hey! (crashing) (Merlin moaning) Come on, my boy, snap cut of it. Wake up, Arthur. Oh, no. What did I do. Why did I take that sword? Merlin: Arthur, Arthur, it's time to wake up. It's not you, my boy, you are not responsible for this, any of it. Merlin: And the one who is I think has learned her lesson. There are some powers that are not to be toyed with. Oh, Arthur, it's time to wake up. Come on, now, you've got a kingdom to rule, Merlin: battles to win, you've got a lot ahead of you, my boy. Merlin: Wake up, Arthur! King Arthur. King Arthur. I really have to do this, don't I? Well, first things first. Off with her head. No, that is not how it works. She too has a destiny to fulfil. In the meantime... Morgause: What are you going to do with me? Well, I think it's time you went back to Orkney. There's a lovely old gentleman named King Lot that you really got to meet. You can't send me so far away... out to the country. I'll just die out in the country. Eventually, yes, but not for many years. Oh, anything but Orkney, it's so dreary and so cold there. I'll have nothing to do. Please let me stay here in London. I'll be a loyal disciple of my darling brother. I do love him after all. We can make this work... (zapping) So she is my sister. Will she be more trouble? I can't promise that she won't. Merlin: How's that for an answer? Go on, tell me what will happen. Isn't that what you're supposed to do? In time, in time. Excuse me, um, can I go home now? Oh, dear. That just sounds wonderful. What do you mean Merlin? Well, Zack, I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you. Merlin: I've been holding off telling you because, well, frankly we had enough to think about. Wait a minute. You just sent Morgause to Orkney wherever that is with just a little wave of the staff there... Zack: Are you trying to tell me you ain't got no more juice in that puppy to send me home? Time travel is a tricky thing, Zackary. You see. It is not so much as a sending matter, as a drawing matter. You see... Merlin: Magic has the power to pluck someone out of another time, into our own. But no magic has the power to send someone through time. No, no, no... this is crazy. This won't do. I can't live here. You guys don't even have proper heating for one, and the food, oh, don't even get me started on you guys' personal hygiene, I mean... Zack: Merlin... I miss my family. Alright, I hate to admit it, but I do. Zack: You're the one always talking about a person's place in history; well I have one, and it is not here. It is at the turn of the century... okay, the 21st century. I'm sorry Zackary, there is nothing I can do. Gwynneth: He's down here! Down here! Zack, Your Majesty, are you all right? Yes. First of all, I am fine, Gwynneth, thanks for asking. And, I am not the King. What? I was brought, I took the sword from the stone due to the treachery of Morgause, the witch who was here before. This is Arthur, he was the one who was supposed to pull the sword from the stone and today, he showed us, by his gallant fighting, wow, you know, that Excalibur belongs to him. Excalibur is broken! -Gwynneth: No. -Man: The country has no king! Courtier: Where is that thing? Seize the imposters! Get him! Courtier 3: Where'd he go? Quickly! Perhaps I can be a knight after all. No, did you see that mob? You can't show your face at that castle again if you value your neck. Arthur: I can go abroad on quests. I can disguise myself and do mysterious acts of chivalry. Merlin: It's not that easy. Oh, I wish I'd never allowed you to interfere. Zack: Cheer up, Merlin, at least tomorrow you won't remember all this, huh... not without trying of course. Well now, that's one way of looking at things, isn't it? Yes, well, the future of England is foiled, but who cares? Merlin: We've got an adventurous future knight and a boy who is more than a millennium ahead of his time. Merlin... Merlin: There must be a ton of things people haven't even thought of that you could take credit for inventing. Hey, Merlin... The long bow... now, that's useful isn't it? Not to mention the steam engine-- Merlin! Merlin: Yes, my boy? Okay, just hear me out a minute. Zack: I have an idea. Now, you live your life backwards, right? Much to my chagrin, I do indeed. And then your past is our future. Yes. Zack: Then your future is our past. Yes. We've discussed this. And if you can only draw people back through time, then-- Why don't I go back to my next week, and draw Arthur back? What are you two talking about? Well, you see, Merlin lives his life backwards... Yes, I got that. So all he's got to do is bring you back a day before Morgause brings me back through time and you're pulling the sword from the stone, brother. Merlin: And once you're crowned, Morgause will have no reason to mess things up. Well, at least not yet. Zack, you're a genius! Well, why don't you just wait until next week, Arthur: and then go back and tell my other self to pull the sword from the stone? (Merlin yells) It took days to convince you this time, I am not going through that again. Besides, I need you, the new Arthur, who fought so valiantly. And I was just getting used to the idea of my quests, that's all. Don't worry, my boy, Your Majesty. You'll have different sorts of quests. Merlin: Now, it's almost midnight. So, goodbye, Zack. What do you mean? Well, if Morgause never brings you back, you're not going to remember any of this Merlin: because it won't have happened. No, I... I guess not. (Merlin groaning) What's the meaning of all that? It's a hug. They'll be popular once you people figure out hygiene. Friends hug each other. You know, to show affection. Well, goodbye, both of you. Thank you. This is really been the most interesting thing that's happened in my life. Or has never happened to me. I just wish I could remember it. But at least now I know where I really belong. Well, goodbye. (clock chiming) Midnight. The changing. (mystical music crescendo) Jeffy: Zack! Where did you go? Over here! Zack, don't be mad at me. I was just trying to make you feel better about moving. You know... I don't even know what I was so upset about. I don't know. I guess... Well... Let's go home. Okay, whatever. Jeffy: You know, you teenagers sure are a moody bunch. (door creaking) The story of the boy from the future and how Arthur really earned the throne of England. Smart boy, that. Why didn't you think of it yourself, you old bat? (dog barking, howling) (chanting) (zapping) You ready? As ready as I'll ever be... (triumphant music)
