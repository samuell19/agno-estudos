THE BOY WHO BECAME A CUPBOARD There are kids galore in the world. And each kid is a bit naughty. Children use their own means of transportation, prefer their own sweets and their own way of artistic expression. But most of all, they're tired of sleeping. Thus someone had the bright idea to hold a big congress to discuss how to deal with the issue. It really was a large scale congress. All the moms and dads attended. Even Africa was represented and the North Pole as well. "So what?" said a fat gentleman with glasses who opened the congress. "I hope that you all take the whole issue seriously and that nobody is missing." But believe it or not! A certain lady in a green hat raised her hand and said, "Actually, one mom and dad are missing." "How come?" said the fat gentleman with glasses. "What a terrible mess!" "This is supposed to be a true congress and not a random gathering of pigeons!" "Well," said the lady in the green hat, "they have a son, Silvester, who is the most well-behaved boy in the world." "Why attend then?" And all the moms and dads started to shout, "Wow!" "Is it really possible to be a parent of the most well-behaved boy in the world?" But the fat gentleman rang the bell and said, "Quiet, please!" "Honorable guests, be quiet!" "We can't all speak at once!" In any case, it would be possible to go see Silvester in person. And if he's truly the most well-behaved boy who's ever existed, he can have his own TV show to lead the other children by example. Then all the moms and dads applauded and started to tell each other, "TV is usually full of crap." "But this could be well worth watching." Then the fat gentleman put on his hat and said, "Wait just awhile, we'll be right back with our findings." He left, accompanied by lady in the green hat, who knew where Silvester lived. They bought peanuts as a snack and traveled by train, until the lady in the green hat said, "We've reached the spot." Then, they got off the train and walked towards Silvester's home. "Hello!" said the fat gentleman with glasses. "We came to make observations of your son." "If he's truly the most well-behaved boy in the world." And Silvester's dad said, "You're welcome!" "Silvester is in the bathroom." "He's just washing his ears for 12th time." "What have you just said?" asked the fat gentleman with glasses. "He's washing his ears for 12th time." said dad. "Silvester is used to washing his ears 18 times a day." "And on Saturday, 20 times!" "Ah, so!" said the fat gentleman with glasses and started to make notes. "Is he washing his ears without reminding?" "Of course!" said mom. "Keep in mind, Silvester is the most well-behaved boy in the world." "Can we see your son?" asked the fat gentlemen who was still somewhat shocked. Thus dad opened the door and called, "Silvester!" Upon which a boy entered the room with reddish, freshly washed, ears, who said, "Hello! My name is Silvester. Nice to meet you!" "One moment!" said the fat gentleman with glasses. SILVESTER SAID, "NICE TO MEET YOU!" Then he shook Silvester's hand and asked him a few questions. For example, what is his daily schedule? And similar inquiries. "If I don't wash my ears, I sit next to a cupboard and try not to scuff the chair legs." said Silvester. "That's absolutely unbelievable!" the fat gentleman with glasses exclaimed. But dad felt offended and responded, "Mind your words! Silvester never lies." "The whole town knows Silvester is more well-behaved than a canary or a sheep." "Mind your words!" objected mom. "He's beyond comparison to a canary or a sheep!" "Silvester behaves better than furniture!" "Look at the old cupboard!" "It creaks so much we'll have to replace it." "However, Silvester never creaks!" Thereupon Silvester cleared his throat and said, "Pardon me! It's not proper for a child to listen to adults' quarrels." The fat gentleman and the lady in the green hat became speechless with mouths wide open, because they had never ever witnessed anything like it. Meanwhile, Silvester started to play with a ball in the garden. But, oops! During play the ball remained stuck between the branches. Silvester thought to himself, "O my goodness! How to behave now?" "Climbing the tree is mischief!" So, he stood still and was clueless what to do. He almost felt like crying. Then suddenly, he realized there's nobody around. Thus, there are no witnesses! However, at this very moment, he noticed two men who claimed, "So, that's the cherry-tree meant for a new cupboard." Before Silvester could take any action, the saw was moving quickly back and forth. "Well," Silvester thought, "if I make them aware of my presence, everyone will know I climb trees like a naughty little monkey." What will my poor mom and dad think of me? Aunt Anezka will have a stroke! I'll make uncle Horymir sick! Thus he resolved to remain completely silent. And as the tree was falling, he held on tight. Thus, he was loaded, transported and stored. In a workshop, they made him into boards. The boards were planed, assembled and painted. And when Silvester became a fine, brand new cupboard, he was delivered to mom's and dad's kitchen. In the kitchen, mom and dad were crying. Even the fat gentleman wept, "Oh, such a terrible misfortune!" "Once we find the most well-behaved boy in the world, he gets lost!" And mom was calling in despair, "Oh, Silvester! Silvester!" "We've got a new cupboard which doesn't creak and you don't know it." "Why do you think so?" responded Silvester. "This cupboard is me!" And mom and dad clapped their hands for joy. The fat gentleman and lady in a green hat threw their hands up too. Thereupon they agreed, "Let's go back to the congress now!" Meanwhile, the congress started to resemble a school during break time. But suddenly, the door opened, and two delivery men entered, carrying a huge package, followed by an extensive TV crew, and the fat gentleman with glasses proclaimed, "Well, we've brought here for you to see, the most well-behaved boy in the world." "Why is he packed up?" asked one dad. "So as not to scuff him," replied the lady in the green hat. "Ah, so!" said the dad. And everyone watched the whole process of unpacking, until the fine, brand new cupboard was fully revealed. "So!" "Well!" said the fat gentleman with glasses. "Let me introduce to you the dear boy Silvester!" But all the moms and dads were completely puzzled. Until one mom asked, "Is Silvester inside? Or what?" "Not at all!" replied the lady in the green hat. "Inside are cups, stirring spoons, cooking pots, and a big salad-bowl." "Then, it's not a boy, but a simple cupboard," remarked one mom. And everyone shouted, "Sure! Sure!" "It's a cupboard!" "It's just a cupboard!" "We're not blind!" However, the fat gentleman shouted back, "Nonsense!" "Complete nonsense!" "It's truly the most well-behaved boy in the world himself." "We personally witnessed, when he washed his ears for 12th time in a day." "Who cares about a little accident of him becoming a cupboard?" "Just behold the perfect order within his head!" And everyone had to admit the order within Silvester's head was exceptional. "But he can hardly run or jump like the other kids," remarked one mom. "He just stands still and stares." "Hey, boy," the fat gentleman addressed Silvester "could you do something to get rid of these annoying remarks?" "No problem!" replied Silvester. "I can for example do a somersault." "Despite such behaviour being highly mischievous." So, he made the somersault which was a big mistake. The result was disastrous as you can see for yourself. He became a scuffed and creaky cupboard. And all the moms and dads shouted, "Eww!" "Eww, we don't want such kids!" "Let them rather stay naughty as they are!" And this message was broadcast by TV to the whole world. And anywhere and everywhere, it was watched by children who laughed. And as they laughed, some were naughty this way, another that way, still another even like this, and all of them refused to go to sleep. THE END
