[Organ music playing] [Tires screeching] Nun: Step away from the curb, children. [Tires screeching] Hi, sister. You look terrific today. What have you done with your hair? You're late again, Rick. I know, I know. But I have a very good excuse. There can be no excuse for tardiness. You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm sorry. I should never have stopped and saved that drowning infant. I--I'm weak, sister. I'm just so weak. All right now. Stop that. Children, on the bus. Sister, if you ever get lonely after vespers, I am the man to call. My number's in the book. Get going, Rick. You're late enough as it is. Think about it, ok? Ok, come along, children. Rick: Attention, passengers. We are now leaving nun central on our journey to hell and beyond. The captain has turned off the "no smoking" sign. And you may now move about the cabin freely. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Thank you for being catholic and for choosing the St. Gabriel school bus. Yeah! Yeah! [All screaming] Ooh! [Hula music] Now, don't forget, Garcia, 10% of that goes to the house. Snake eyes. Ah, youth. O'Neill: You'll love these shots. Thank you very much, Mrs. Reeves. Thank you. Have a nice day. Next! Whoa ho ho ho! Look at those babies! Adorable. Come on, let's get started. Are we married? I'm separated. Then there is a god. Let's try something a little special. Try these on, Timmy. Oh, yeah. Shield out the sun. Yeah. Here. Why don't you take that drink right there? Yeah, that looks like fun, hmm? Hmm? To me, this is an incredible shot. Ok, ok, I can see you're not impressed, and you know what? You're right. I hate it, too. That's because your kid is more hip, more now, more eighties. Let's try this right here. Now get ready. Hold onto yourself-- I'm crazy about this one. Your own baby jedi. This is terrific. This is terrific. You're gonna like this one, huh? Huh? Huh?! All right. You're not into science fiction. Ok, let me think about this. Oh! Mrs. Klupner, why didn't I see this before? Why don't you lean into the picture with your child? Oh, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes. Lean in a little more. If I was that kid, I would breast-feed till I was 17 or 18. Ok. Now, hold that pose, Mrs. Klupner. Ok, why don't you go to sleep, huh? There we go. Good boy. There we go. ♪ Margarita ♪ ♪ yo te quiero mucho querida ♪ ♪ yo quiero patitas grandes ♪ Raul! [Speaking Spanish] Who the hell put this shit in my beer cooler?! Jesus Christ! Stupid people.

Come on, help me put this crap together and we'll get out of here. Gary: The police concert's sold out? My customers are gonna kill me! Aw, screw that! Oh, screw sting! Hi, guys. How's it going? All right. How are you, you animal? Great. I'm a dead man. [Telephone rings] Hello, concert tickets. What? You're kidding! Boy George has a yeast infection? He's canceling? You know what this is gonna cost me?! Hey, do me a favor. Don't call me again, ok? Let's get out of here. [Ring] I told you not to call me again. You're full of shit! Eat my-- oh, hi, mom.

Veal... Par... What's this word? It's parmesan. Yeah, that's meat with that cheese on it. See, I don't eat cheese. It gives me mucus, it clogs me up with phlegm, I don't like it. And butter, that's another thing. It clogs you up with snot. Please, we're in a hurry. Ryko, come on! Take a break! Hey, be right there, guys. Hey, will you keep your slimy paws out of my food, man? Why don't you order your own food, man? I hope you choke, you animal. Hey, guys, hey. How are you doing? Get out of here! All right, ok, now we're all here. So what's the big announcement? Ok. Ok. Gentlemen... I am not gonna beat around the bush on this thing. We've known each other since what? Since we were in grade school, for crying out loud, so I'm just gonna give this to you right from the hip. I mean, it's gonna come straight from the old-- from the old shoulder. I mean, no fancy stuff. Come on, Rick! All right. Ok. All right, all right. All right, this is it. Uh... I'm getting married. Yeah, right. Yeah. All right, ok. No problem. That wasn't a joke. That was not a joke, guys! A week from this Saturday, I turn in my amateur standing, and I go pro. I don't believe it. Come on. Fuck me! Well, thanks for telling US, man. I just told you-- remember how you complained about Brad getting married? You're doing the same thing. Guys. Guys. Guys. I can't believe this! Guys! Our buddy is getting married. This is the happiest moment of his life, and you guys are giving him a hard time. You guys should be ashamed of yourselves. Congratulations, buddy. Come on, guys! Look, Rick, I'd rather be dead. But look, if this is what you want, good luck, man. All the best. All right. You know, since you're gonna do this-- you really are gonna do this? Oh, yeah. The least we can do is make sure you go out in style. Yeah, let's have a bachelor party with chicks and guns and fire trucks and hookers and drugs and booze! Yeah, yeah, yeah! All the things that make life worth living for. Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! All right. All right, all right. Ok, ok, guys. I--i want you to know that this marriage is not in any way gonna jeopardize my relationship with my pals, damn it. Yeah, right. We're still gonna go bowling every Tuesday night. We're still gonna play cards every Friday. And we're still gonna wear each other's underwear every Sunday night. Nothing is gonna change! I mean that. I love you guys, and--and I always will.

What's happening? Debbie is marrying Rick. Really?! Really. Oh, my god! Oh! Oh, my gosh. You're actually marrying Rick. Wait a minute. Does Cole know about this? Really. You went with him for two years. No. And he won't leave me alone. And your parents can't be too thrilled about this, either. No, as far as they're concerned, the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I've made my decision, and we're gonna do it. I don't believe it. Mrs. Rick gassko. You're getting married. Seems like only yesterday I showed you how to give a blow job.

You've made me the happiest spice in the world. It's a veritable u.N. For dinner here, so...swedish meatballs. Hey, oinga, oinga, Olga. Ooh, there we are. 2, 3. Ah, vino. A little vino would be keen-o. Ha ha! I want some wine. Now--oh! What meal would be complete without a little dead meat? Yes. America's favorite food, dead animal flesh. Hup! All the burners are occupied at this time, so I'll just have to improvise here. Hi, babe. Rick: Hi! What are you doing? Just welding up a little dinner, that's all. Mmm... It's you! Hi. Hi. How are you? It's good to see you. You, too. I'm just gonna graze here for a while, ok? God, you're a slob. Yeah, but i'm a fabulous cook. Yeah? What are we having? Well, it's either Swiss steak, meatloaf, I don't know. Definitely charred flesh of some sort. Why don't we name it after we eat, huh? Good idea. Mr. Chef? Yes. Your vegetables are on fire. Ohh! Hey! It's ok. It's all right. It's broccoli flambe. It's supposed to do that. A little tricky with it, that's all. Guess I put in a little too much nuclear waste, huh? You want to hear something great? You betcha. Bobbi and Phoebe are gonna throw me a shower. It's gonna be so much fun. Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are gonna throw for me. I hope you like potato salad. It's chunky style, my favorite. You're gonna have a bachelor party? Sure, you bet. Hey, it's a traditional event, and I'm a traditional kind of guy. How about this, huh? Does this look great or what? It looks awful. Well, looks can be deceiving. Not in this case, however. Nope, nope, nope. This is definitely the food prison riots are made of. Ew. Are we gonna have girls at our party? Uh, well, uh, no. It's a stag party, and that means that does stay home. I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers. Oh, those. What do you mean? I mean, like, from what I hear, it's a tradition, and you're a traditional guy. Come here. Come here, you little Vixen. I'll gonna tell you something. I'm gonna set you straight about something. Women mean nothing to me and that is why I am so in love you. Do you understand what I'm saying? I need you to promise me. Ok, ok. I promise. You got it. You know, I know a way that we can seal this bond. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Oh, wait a minute! Wait, wait, wait, wait. I've got a surprise for you, and I think you're really gonna like it. Ahh! Aw, come on, honey. Wait! Hey, come on. We'll take turns. It's all right. Whoo-hoo! Ok, Ricky. You want to hold out your arm? You wouldn't hurt your own brother, would you, Stan? I don't hurt brothers. Hey! Hey! No, no! I've changed my mind. I don't need a blood test. I'm not even gonna get married. The wedding's off, chief. Bear. Bear. Chicken, chicken, chicken. Oww! You were always sneaky, Stan. You were always very, very sneaky. Ooh. Oh, gosh. Sneaky brother. Hey, you ready for this big party now? I understand that the guys have some fascinating women lined up for you. A bevy of-- would you-- keep your voice down. I've got the wife in the other room. Rick: Uh, Stan. Stan, is this supposed to be like this? Huh? No, that's incorrect. Oh. I can't understand why you're getting married. Do you have any idea what you're giving up, huh? Do you have any idea? An inkling? Everything! Everything. Wild parties. Running around like a maniac. Different women every night. Nakedness. Gone! I miss that so much, richy. Stan, you're beginning to depress me. Oh. Well... Maybe you'll feel just a little better after this. Easy, easy, and hold. Oh, well, now, that's a fair trade: A cotton ball for all my blood. Ok, Ricky. All finished. Oh, good. Hey, I'm really looking forward to this bachelor party. Oh, I know you are. Whatever you do, you don't say nothing to Tina, ok? You know, she'll kill me. Who don't you say nothing to? Tina? Tina. Ok. Don't screw me up here, ok? I told her I'm going to a plasma convention. Oh, well, that's brilliant. Hi! Hi, Tina. Rick! Mr. Goldsmith, this is my brother-in-law. He's getting married. Congratulations. Nurse, take over. Yes, doctor. I'm so happy for you! That's great. I'm glad. Thanks. Listen, I gotta run. I gotta make sure the guys have got the hookers! Hookers? He didn't say "hookers." Did I say "hookers?" I didn't mean "hookers." Yes, you said "hookers." He didn't say "hookers." I'm walking Ricky out. Stan: You had to open your mouth. You had to say something! You had to say "hookers!" Ooh, doc, I'll pay my bill. Doc, don't hurt me! Please! I'll kill you! I'll--I'll pay! Doctor, please! I'll break your lights! I'll rip out your guts! I'll break you in half! Shut up and get out of here! Ok, all right. Go. Ok. Oh. Listen. I'm gonna see you Saturday night for the bugga bugga. Out! All right, all right. Mrs. Phillips, you're next. Rick: I got it! Ok, who serves? Your turn, dad. Whoop! Rick: It's long, it's to the fence, it's to the wall, it's gone! [Imitates cheering] Ed: Rick? Yeah? Hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it. Maybe we should go in now. No. We will at least finish this set. Ready? Yo! Uhh! [Cheering] Yes! Cleveland wins the pennant! One of these days, I'm gonna burn the Thompson court right to the ground. Well, I gotta admit my tennis is a little rusty. But Polo, there's a game, eh? Unrelenting, constant challenge to the senses, a beautiful, manly experience. Rick... I want to cut through the b.S. I'd like that. Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that. An immature asshole. Which is fine, except that you're marrying my daughter, and I'm afraid that my grandchildren are gonna be little assholes. Uh, Mr. Thompson, i-- no, let me finish. Debbie is an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're gonna have to change some things about yourself. Now, if I may make some suggestions? Oh, feel free. Good. First, you're a slob. You dress like a bum. Second, you're unmotivated. You have no self-esteem, no thought about the future. You're inconsiderate. You're insensitive, you're insincere... I'm having the same caterer for your shower that we had at our Christmas party last year. Oh, that'd be great. They're wonderful. Well, if I were you, i'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party. Why? Why would I wanna do that? I trust Rick. Oh, of course you do. And I trusted my ex, Kevin, too. Cousin, I can only speak to you from experience. But what do you think happens during these bachelor parties? Think they sit around and drink tea and play scrabble? Eileen, I trust Rick. He promised-- oh, Debbie, please. Don't be naive. Men are pigs. Uh, girls, why don't we go inside and have some lunch, huh? Boys, come on inside and have lunch. In a second. And you're irresponsible, a show-off. You're vulgar, you're inappropriate. You're unrefined, you're obnoxious. Well, Mr. Thompson, that's really quite a list. And you're right. You're absolutely right. And, uh, I think if I really apply myself, I could be a totally changed person by the time we finish lunch. ♪ Do Dee doo ♪ ♪ do doo ♪ ♪ do Dee Dee do do ♪ [Whistling] Rick...we don't have a dog. Oh, that's too bad. That's a waste of some good fat. Oh, you gonna eat your potato there, darling? You want this? You betcha. Yeah, me and Debbie are gonna have kids right away, I think. I'd like to adopt this 17-year-old korean girl I've had my eye on for a while. I figure why beat around the bush, you know? But, I mean, this pup is fertile, and I know I'm perfectly capable. So, you don't have to worry. You'll have some American grandkids in no time at all. No, thank you. I tell you, Mrs. T., this is really some spread. This is some pretty good chow. Usually, I just have like a jam sandwich for lunch. [Doorbell rings] You know what a jam sandwich is? Take 2 pieces of bread, jam 'em together. Ha ha! Cole: Hello, everybody. Am I late? Not at all. We're just finishing lunch. How are you, Cole? Fine. Just fine. Eileen! Cole. You're looking very well. Mrs. Thompson. Cole. Always a pleasure. Oh... Debbie. And, uh... Bond. James Bond. So, Cole, how's your game coming along? Better and better, sir. Good. I'll take you on. We tried some doubles this morning, but it didn't work out too well. Mother, what is Cole doing here? Well, you know your father enjoys his company. Oh, he must, if he took time off from his Hitler youth rally. Aah! Good shot. Thank you, sir. Cole...i know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to...Rick. Yes, I am, sir. Son, I don't want you to give up on her. I've tried to change her mind. It's not her mind you gave to change. It's Mr. Shit-for-brains in there. Yeah, but how can I do that? If it were up to me, I'd reason with him first. And if that failed, I'd try more persuasive action. More, uh, persuasive action? Good. Keep me informed. Well, good-bye, darling. Good-bye, mom. Thanks for everything. It was great. Mm-hmm. And, uh, nice seeing you again, Rick. Oh, you too, Mrs. T. Let's do this every day. How about tomorrow? I'll bring some weenies. Well, I have a club. What time's it over? Uh, Rick, let's talk. Honey, the boys have something important to discuss. Let's leave them alone for a minute, huh? If this is about the facts of life, believe me, I got it covered. Rick, I want Debbie. You do, huh? Yes, I do. You dump her, and I'll give you cash. Well, what's Debbie's blue book value right now? $5,000. No. 7,500. Uh-uh. Not interested. All right, all right, all right. 10,000, plus a g.E. Toaster oven, a litton microwave, a cuisinart-- Cole, read my lips now. I am marrying Debbie. Michelin tires, brand new. A set of sears' best metric tools. What's going on here? Well, the way I see it, this big lug is in love, and he's got a lot of major appliances laying around. Debbie, Cole is just trying to save you from making a mistake. A big mistake. Oh, daddy. Hey, thanks, dad. Listen, we gotta go. Debbie, he's gonna hurt you. He'll never be true to you the way I would. And we're all gonna keep that in mind. Cole whittier, ladies and gentlemen. Let's hear it for him, a funny, funny, funny guy, as well as being a wonderfully talented human being. Take care, babe. We love you. Hey, Rick. You and I, we're not through yet. [Thunder] Hey. Hey. What? I can't sleep. Oh. I got something for that. Will you stop fooling around? I need to talk. What's the matter? I don't know. I just feel scared. Oh, baby, what about...Hmm? The wedding, my parents, your parents, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, the honeymoon, our apartment, my shower, your bachelor party. Well, how about the middle east? You all right with that? Oh, honey, everything is gonna be ok. Before or after I have my nervous breakdown? All right, come on. Come here. Oh, hey. Oh, you are so tense. Come on. That feels so good. That's a coincidence. It's supposed to. Close your eyes. Drift off to slumberland, eh? It just so happens that I'm a great guy, and very soon, you're going to be Mrs. Great guy. All right? Well, there you go, ma'am. End of the line. Last stop. Listen, I have a great idea. Why don't I just pal around with you guys for a while? Oh, no, no, no... We have some manly things we have to do, and this is no place for a woman. You sure you don't want me to go? Men: Uh, how about "no"? Uh-uhh. I don't want to go. Remember, you promised me no screwing around. I won't. I won't. I swear on my mother's grave. Your mother's not dead. Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her. Then you have a good time. Mm-hmm. But don't have a great time. You catch my drift, Mr. Traditional guy? Yeah, I understand. You have a fun shower. Use soap. I love you. And I love you. Rudy: Come on, Rick! Party! Jay: Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Jay: This place is unbelievable. Presidents have stayed in this suite. It's gorgeous. I got half price on it. I know this chick who works at the hotel. Stan: What presidents? What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. Let's get crazy. Yeah! Whoo! When do the girls show up? Don't worry about it. Gary is taking care of that right now. All right! Whoo! Party! All right... I think I got just what you're looking for. Gary: Great, great. Margot, Darlene. These are twins of pleasure. Wow! Twins. Great, great. They're gonna be just fine, just fine. Woman: That'll be $50. Hi, ladies. Listen, maybe after the orgy tonight, we can get together, have a cup coffee or something? Thanks, man. Hey, we'll see you girls later. Ciao. [Giggles] Hi. Hi. Say, I must have just missed my friend. Um, he hired some of your girls for a bachelor party. Yeah, parkview hotel, room 1002. What about it? Yeah, right, well, um, here's the new address. Now, there's been a slight change of plans. We decided to send the girls over to his house instead. Oh, really? Yeah, and, uh, here's a 50. Now, I want this to be a surprise for the groom, so you never saw me, ok? No problem. Move it out, move it out, move it out, move it out. Come on, hurry up. Now, you be careful with that bus. It's a rental. Was I kidding? Was I kidding? We, who are about to go apeshit, salute you. We want women! [All shouting] Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it! Before we move on, I have a little surprise. Ooh... Cool. O'Neill: I have flown in someone dear to all of US, a man who has traveled over 3,000 miles. Come on, Rick, let's go. Come on! A man whom none of US have seen since he left town. Come on! Come on! A man we affectionately called pecker head! Oh, my god, our dad is here. Ricky, let's go. It's your childhood chum and mine, Brad mollen! Oh, that pecker head! Where is he? Brad. Guys, guys, guys, guys! For the last time, I'm telling you to get off of there! Off! Off! Ok. Guys! Holy shit! Doctor Stan. Hi, Brad. Rick. Rick, Rick. Jay! Rudy. Diagnosis? Medically speaking? Yeah. Whacked out of his brains on drugs. That's what I thought. This is great. This is beautiful. Ha ha ha! I love it. I love it. Brad, how have you been? Oh, I couldn't be better. This is the best. This is great. I love this. This is the best. I'm having the best time. I love you guys. I love everybody. How's the wife? I hate her. I hate her guts, ok? The bitch! I've got this. Do you want to share this? Oh, gee, no. Two on a quaalude, that's bad luck. Thanks. Oh, right. Ok, hey, let's go, guys. Come on, Brad, listen. Hey, you and your wife got problems, Brad? No, no, because I love you guys. I love my friends! I love everybody! I just want to party! Party! Yeah! [All shouting] Just where do you guys think you are? The library of congress? Detroit? Beyond the sun? Any of those right? This is the parkview hotel. I am the hotel manager. [Whistles] This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. So I see. Well, thank you. It's been very nice talking to you. You're a hell of a guy, and I think you're doing a hell of a job. Pamela, you're here. Now nice. Come say hello to our guest of honor. Pamela, how are you? It's so nice to see you. You look great, martine. Oh, thanks, honey. Debbie, it's Pamela. Hey, Pamela, how are you? Thank you. Come sit down and I'll get you some punch. Mmm... Mrs. Thompson, do you have any more of this dip? It's, like, really excellent. You just ate purina cat chow. Oh, it's, like, so good. Mmm... And what are you girls giggling about? Should we tell her? Yeah. Yesterday, we found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car. And we made a few changes. I think the boys will really be interested. Oh, well, good. I hope you ruin their stag party, those swine. What room is it? 1003. Aha! 1002. And now, to our honored guest, Rick, and his life-long friends, I say, gentlemen... Start your boners. Ryko: Wow. Women! Whoo hoo! Whoo! Ryko: Yeah, wow, this is a bitchin' place. Yeah. Ohh... I am stunned. I did the balloons myself. Oh, what a clever use of prophylactics! This is beyond my wildest dreams, guys! Where's the women? There's no women here. Rudy, one thing at a time. Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it. Ok, what's first? A bit of a warm-up. We spend an hour with nymphos without pants. Whoo! Whoo! Olivier's in that, right? Yeah! O'Neill: Men, it's time for the real thing. Ok, Rudy, screen. All right! Real thing here. It's good to see you, Brad. My marriage sucks. It's all crap. It's just a big pile of shit! Well, maybe your marriage ought to lay off the grains for a while. Rick, Rick, don't you understand? She hates me! She hates my guts. It's over. You'll see. You'll see. As soon as you get married, everything changes. Why are you going through with this? Why are you marrying her? Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean? What changes? O'Neill: Ok, ryko. Lights. Lights. Whoo! Bawk! Bawk! Bawk! King Kong, folks. Here we go! There we go. O'Neill: A friend of mine's in this. I viewed it yesterday. Great director, good lighting. Yeah. Yeah! Take that off, baby! Take it off and drive it home! Watch out for Rudy! Oh, god, this doesn't waste any time, does it? Oh, yeah. Ha ha ha! Ooh. Oh! Do it, brother! Lay that pipe. Drive it home, brother. Give it to her! Rick: What happened? Hey, what? What gives? Did you check this out? Kick it! Kick it! Oh, forget that. This part's so much better. You guys can't believe-- it's a human being doing this. Watch this. Kiss him all the way down! All the way down! Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go! All: Go! Go! Go! Oh! What is this? Hey, what is this? What is going on? I am not complaining, but I usually don't like my filth this clean. What a waste of two women! I don't get it. The dirty parts were there yesterday. But at least Gary's coming up here with the real thing in a few minutes. Oh, yeah. Women! [All screaming] [Doorbell rings] Yes? Yeah, hi. Is this 1381 franek street? Yes. We're here. Why, how nice. Um...i'm Dr. Tina gassko. Oh, Tina! Stan's wife. Well, come in, come in. God, now she's really gonna see what kind of a jerk-off she's marrying. [Indistinct conversation] Rick is just gonna love all of these. Debbie, Debbie, look, it's Tina. I think everyone's here now. Look who's here. It's Tina. Hi. Woman: You wouldn't believe what I just saw. Another one of these, huh? Looks that way. A buck's a buck. Yep. [Chattering continues] Hi, Tina. Woman: You know everybody here? [Crack] Ohh! Is there an empty outlet around here? Over there. Thanks. [Buzz] Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! How dare you speak in that manner! You impudent little-- I can't take the torture much longer. I'm cold, and I'm hungry, too. Do you hear? No, you don't hear. And you don't care. Oh, god, this is beautiful. She reminds me of my wife. She was so young when we met. You bitch! Hi, guys, how's it going? Get him, get him! There's no chicks here. Everybody back! Hey! To a neutral corner, please. What's going on? Nothing's going on! Will you get that animal off of me! This place should be wall-to-wall tits by now. Oh, guy paints a beautiful picture. [All shouting] All right, all right, all right! I'll find out what's going on. You know what, Gary? Looks like the only guy who got screwed around here was you. Hey, screw you. Should, should, should. I can't believe my money's been wasted. So, what do you guys think of the party so far, huh? All right, okay... [Murmuring] I think the man has done a very good job with the party so far. All right, maybe not, you know? Well... I agree... Rick, I want to talk to you. Hey, it's Cole. Did any of you guys order an asshole from room service? Hey, look, I don't want any trouble, all right? Oh, well, come on, just a little. Rick, I want to make you another deal. Oh, be still, my heart. If you just step over to the window, there's something I want to show you. Out the window? Oh, this is gonna be a surprise. I'm a nut for surprises. You see that out there? That, Rick, is my most prized possession. That's my new Porsche. Rick: Whoa! Hey, guys, can you see that car? Oh, that's beautiful. What a car! Hey! Rudy, isn't that a beautiful car? Yeah. Oh, yeah! Yeah! That's a beautiful car. Hey, guys, excuse me. I gotta go shake the weasel. It's a great car. Oh, the best. God, I love that car. Oh, I am very, very happy for the two of you. Chips? Now, listen, Rick, I'm willing to trade you my new Porsche for Debbie. An even swap. Oh, Cole, a car for Debbie? I mean it, Rick. The car is yours. All you have to do is dump Debbie. Oh! Oh, Cole. Oh, this is perplexing. What an intriguing offer you've made! Guys, what should I do? Should I take the car or should I take Debbie? Debbie! Car, car, car. Depends on which gets better mileage. The car! Debbie. Take Debbie. The car! Debbie. The car. What a decision I have to make here! I would hate to be in your shoes, pal. Low mileage, it handles like a dream. Well, so does Debbie. I just got that car 2 months ago. It's got everything. It's got-- shit! Shit, shit, shit! Something amiss? My car is gone! Maybe it had something to do. You know-- if I don't get my car back, you're dead, mister! Gone just a few seconds, and I miss him already. [Wang chung's dance hall days playing] Don't you think it's a little childish getting revenge on the guys like this? Oh, Debbie, please. You heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party. So what? That doesn't mean it was Rick's party. Good evening, ladies. Follow me. Just go, will you? Just don't touch anything. Go ahead. Go on.

Where's the young man? [Knock] What are you doing? I'm killing myself. Oh. You know, Brad, marriage is a dicey thing at best. And sometimes people say things they don't mean. But, I mean, you and sue, you're mature people. Eventually, you'll work this stuff out. You gotta lighten up. No, Rick, I don't care anymore. She hates me. I'm gonna end it all right here. [Thud] Oh! Oh, god. Oh! Are you all right? Oh, yeah. Pain is such a rush. Oh, this is good. Is there anything I can do for you? Oh, no. This is pain. Fabulous. Brad: There could be some major damage here.

Hookers! It's a party! Party, Ricky! Debbie: Find anything? I had a wiener right in my hand. I told you, Lynette, men are pigs! I saw those swine just standing there. God, what a gross thing to do! You know, I have to admit, even for Rick, that was beyond the valley good taste. Yeah, well, Rick and his pals--pfft-- are probably knee-deep in whores by now. Phoebe : I can't wait to see what those guys are up to. Bobbi: Me, either. Well, if I find out Stanley's been screwing around, I'll kill him! Kill? I won't do anything that drastic.
