Robert loves me! He just asked me for love. Ha-ha-ha. Daddy ready yet? If you're not, you'll be late. I'm sorry, but if the bike has already been used... I can only exchange it for an additional cost. But this is a special case, Ms. Morestan. Be sensible. If we are going to exchange goods... whenever a relationship breaks up... Good morning my friend. Good morning, Mr Morestan. How can I help you? I asked Mrs. Morestan to exchange my tandem bike for this one. Said we couldn't do it at no additional cost. What happened? Bought it a few weeks ago. I remember very well. He was accompanied by a nice girl. One with wavy hair. They were going to get married soon. let's go. But it's all over. N�o! Oh, Michelle... The tandem has already been used. But don't understand... I'm feeling lonely. Every time I look at the empty seat I remember her. As if that wasn't enough, you still have to try twice as hard. All right, take the bike. It's yours. Thank you, Mr. Morestan. Thank you very much. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Well, it doesn't hurt to be kind to him. You are unhappy in love. Why didn't you get a pair of tires or a phonograph? It would definitely be happier. be l... What is this cupid doing at the counter? Looks like we're selling bows and arrows. It doesn't make sense. Dad, put on your coat. Quick, we're going to be late. No? Who said you will? I don't see why not. Stay here and help your mother. Will be missed at the store. If he can waste time with this nonsense, why not him? nonsense? How can you talk like that? Since when is being a judge silly? When duty calls, our obligation as a French citizen is to serve. Everyone runs away, only my husband asks about it. Right on time, right on time! At what time? To go with you to the trial. Why does everyone think judgment is a picnic? I want to go. I want to see Dad as a juror. I can? I don't want you to go to trials. If he wants to deal with criminals, fine. Not you. Tell your mother which jurors deal with the police. Not with criminals. And judgment is no place for a child. I'm not a child. Robert just asked me to marry him. H�? �. Michelle, make sure nothing happens until I get back. Hey, voc! Where do you think you're going? I have an appointment with the president of the court. He's busy. You have to talk to the clerk. Who is the scribe? It is me. But I'm also busy. next. I'm a juror. to the left. I'm also a juror. Why didn't you speak? to the left. next. Excuse me, sir. lost. Thanks. There was not so much thirst! My God... Are you a juror? Yes. I'm Louis Roland, wine merchant. I have a bar. My name is Andr Morestan. I have a bicycle and musical instrument store I am really sorry. My name is André Morestan. I have a bicycle and musical instrument store. Henry Lurette. Contador. He worked for Majestic Finance. And currently? I am free. Ole, Gaston. Ole, Lurette. Congratulations. I hope you are very happy. How could? Soon today. Terr�vel. What's his problem? This morning he married a singer from the Folies Berg�re. For a man like him, he was lucky. And spend the honeymoon here. It's a pity. But when the Republic calls, we must all answer. It must be your first time. Yes Yes. I waited 27 years for the chance to be called up as a judge. Have you been called before? Yes. In the case of Bluebeard. Yes, I remember reading about it. The husband who killed his wife, right? Are you one? Four. It must have been quite an affair. Yes. Only it hadn't been him. I later realized he was innocent. Later? After it was run. H�? Please ask the jurors to meet in the judge's room. Here we go, anyway. They swear before God and men to carefully examine... the charge made against Natalie Roguin? And that they will decide according to the accusation and the evidence... based on your consciences and sincere personal convictions... with impartiality and firmness befitting the honesty of free men? Interest. Jurors, the rest is in your hands. However, we will do everything to help you make the right decision. �timo, �ptimo. And remember... Do not discuss the case with anyone outside. Thank you gentlemen. I think it's everything. Mr. President... Yes? What about me? You are alternate jurors. Does that mean they can't call me? Probably. Oh. They can be called in case of impediment of one of the regulars. Therefore, follow the judgment as if you were a juror. But, Mr. President... I would like to know... May I know if... Regular jurors enter first. Regular jurors? Why did they call me? I waited 27 years for this? Her name is Natalie Roguin. Accused of killing Gilbert Marigner. He met the victim, Gilbert Marigner, on October 20. Tell the jurors where and how. Was... It was on the street. It rained that night. I had nowhere to go. She walked aimlessly. He approached... You're used to it, aren't you? Oh, n�o... Continue. Offered to take me home. Did you readily accept? How could it? I had nowhere to go. Continue. When I told him that, he invited me to dinner. In a private room? no. He wasn't like that. We went to a bar. It was very kind. Was always. So, let's see. He rented him an apartment for 2,000 francs. He bought her clothes and furs for 18,000 francs. It's not true. It is undeniable that they felt something for each other. Otherwise, a man would not do all this. What exactly happened on the day of the crime? Do I need to repeat or don't want to answer? Mr. President, something is wrong with the fifth juror. Take him away. What was it? Deferred judgment. Gentlemen, unfortunately the fifth juror is unable to remain. What are the alternate jurors? I, sir. I, sir. I'm ready. Have you watched carefully so far? I didn't miss anything. Did you hear the testimony? Yes sir. Two grand for the apartment, 18,000 for the clothes, dinner, everything. Very good. I think we can go on. great. That's what we came for. Let's not waste time. That night we argued. For the first time he was really cruel to me. It hit me. I thought it would be better for us if I left him. So I left for Nogent. Gilbert soon found out where I was. He looked for me and asked me to come back. I refused and begged him to leave me alone and forget about me. The more he begged, the more nervous he became. When he realized he was determined... amea�ou to kill me. When I realized the state I was in... How so, state? Well... I'd had too much to drink. You are lying. She is not telling the truth. lost. I lost control, Mr. President. My son never drank. Mr. Marigner, you will be heard when it is your turn. Continue. You love to kill me. He was armed with a pistol. I knew I wasn't accountable for his actions, so I tried to get the pistol. He resisted. She fired. When I saw him fall, I fainted. Later I was told... who had died. Finished? Nothing more to add? N�o. Call the first witness. Raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth? Yes. My name is Nicholas Farkas. Taxi driver, Hungarian, 43 years old. I am not a French citizen. Mr. Farkas, do you know Natalie Roguin? Yes, I've known her for years. His father died when he was a child. I took care of her... Stop, what is this? Where do you think you are? Call the next witness. Thank you, Mr. Farkas. What language were you speaking? what language? Pray... Don't you know? Hungarian. You can give your testimony. I don't have much to say. Many of you are parents and know what it's like to make plans for your kids. They also know what it's like to see those dreams suddenly destroyed by... someone like that. At first I didn't take it seriously. After all, she was just a woman he'd met on the street. But when he started asking for such absurd amounts of money... I realized that I was being tricked. A few days before he died, he told me... that he would get rid of her if he paid what she asked. It's not true. He also said that he was afraid that if he didn't get the money... Excuse me, sir. Did you say "fear"? I need to question the term used. How could I be afraid? He was afraid that if he didn't pay she would kill him. But a rich man like you wouldn't stop paying to keep his son alive. If he really thought his life was in danger. I didn't believe anyone could ask for so much. I thought I could get rid of her for less. Like a good businessman. And then what happened? He stole from me. She made him a thief. But it didn't stop there. Had to take his life. Well, Mr. sailor. Did it not occur to you that your son might be lying? Who asked for all that money not to shut us up... but to settle gambling debts? He went to her apartment that afternoon to give her the money. I took it myself. Did you say that afternoon? Yes. I mean, that night. No, I remember well that it was late. I insist we didn't see your son until that night. I'm sure it was late. For I returned to my office after leaving Gilbert. I believe the juror wants to speak. Mr. President... I'd like... Speak louder, I can't hear. Mr. President... I can ask a question? Yes, proceed. Mr. Marigner saw Miss. Roguin when she took her son? no. He went up alone. We arranged to meet later. I never saw him alive again. To what address Mr. Did Marigner take your son? Avenida Henri Martin, 800, of course. Avenida Henri Martin, 800, no. He is mistaken. I left it on Rue St. Sulpice, 40. St. Sulpice, 40? We never lived at that address. Am I right? Mr. President, she says she never lived on Rue St. Sulpice, 40. Can we know who Gilbert Marigner went to meet at that address? The question is irrelevant and immaterial. On the contrary! It is extremely material. And we'll take steps to find out who he visited the afternoon he died. And I want to thank the fifth juror for asking such an important question. That jury story is going to your head. I've never seen him take anything so seriously. But it's a very serious thing. I'ts very interesting. When Natalie Roguin witnessed... Is she the killer? Yes... no! Not the killer. It hasn't been proven yet. The lovebirds again. They look like canaries. What a strange generation. I'll be right there, Robert. Robert, don't look. I'm hideous. What did he say? I still haven't talked to him. It arrived too late. Ask now. Wait until I ask. Ask what? Dad, we've decided to go. V�o? Sim. If he forgot about the assassin, he would know they wanted to get married. Yes Dad. Oh! And Robert wanted to talk about the dowry. Mmm, I understand very well. Robert! Ol�, Sr. Morestan. Fran�oise says she has something to ask of me. Well, what... There's no hurry. I... Good night Sir. Morestan. It's getting late. There's plenty of time to deal with it. You're right. There's plenty of time for that. That ends the matter for today. Leave it to me. So I never get married. I want to live fully, don't you understand? Don't worry, Fran�oise. Believe me. I won't let a spinster end up. You will be very happy. promise? I promise. Good night. Good night. Goodnight My Dear. You're going to insist with him, aren't you? Yes Yes. Now go to bed. You can't even imagine how happy I am! Never get tired of it? Do you know what your problem is, Pierre? It's not romantic. It's too late for that, kids. But it's true. What does he see through the telescope? It's stars. When I look up I see love. How are you feeling today? Eager to get back to court? Hard to say. Yes no. It's interesting but very tiring. Tiring? Don't you just sit around and listen? The others maybe. Not me. I follow everything carefully. I asked a question that could mean the solution of the case. Allow you to interfere? The President tried to stop me. But I asked who he thought he was talking to. I'm a juror. I represent the people. I also put the prosecutor in his place. Watch out or you'll get stuck. nonsense. They respect me. I'm uncomfortable, but they respect me. How long do you think it will last? A few days. We better go to sleep. Goodnight darling. Don't delay. Leave it to me. Don't worry so much about me. Good night dad. Good night. Turn off the light. I'm dizzy with so much question and answer. What kind of woman is this Natalie Roguin? I cannot comment on the case with family members. Good thing is not, to be in this trouble. One should not condemn what one does not know. They said in the market that it is not a good thing. Market, market... is the new Court of Justice. Tomorrow we transfer and judge the case there. Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth? Raise your right hand and say: I swear. I swear. Your name? Natalie Roguin. As I said? Excuse me, but it's Natalie Roguin. Same as ours, Mr. President. Same as ours. What is your address? Street St. Sulpice, 40. Tell us about the strange visit you had on October 16th. I was at home listening to the radio... when someone knocked so hard on the door that it scared me. When I opened it, an unknown young man pushed me out of his way. When I tried to stop him, he asked for Natalie Roquin. Must have received information from a detective agency... who was deceived by the similarity of the names. Said he was right. But what could you want with me? Said he wanted to see Natalie Roguin. I said it was Natalie Roguin. Said I was lying. I said I wasn't. A� pushed me and broke into my apartment. Started looking in all the rooms. Five bedrooms. As he couldn't find it, he said that if he didn't tell where he had hidden it... that would kill me Gilbert Marigner amea�ou-a de morte. Threatened this woman, not accused. Does the juror want to ask a question? Yes sir President. is it important? Well... Not so much. So please sit down. I tried to convince him I was another Natalie Roguin. And that he had never met the other. And that he wasn't hiding it. But he remained very agitated. And that he would find her no matter what the cost. That's what he said. Thank you, ma'am. You are dismissed. Just a moment. When Gilbert Marigner visited you, was he drunk? No, I was completely sober. I appreciate it, my lady. Thank you very much. guilty. Innocent. I can't make up my mind. guilty. 90% guilty, 10% in debt. Well, gentlemen. It remains the same. No verdict. It was to be expected. The same fools thinking the same way. Are you calling me a fool? Special voice. They're all crazy. Be careful how you speak. I don't tolerate being insulted. Don't admit it? Well, it's an insult to be here with you. Do you feel better? is as foolish as any other. Inclusive voc�! Inclusive voc�! It was looking at me! If I did, I would have said. Who did you look at? Citizens, what a shame! I don't see her mixing well with Hungarians. Even the prosecutor said he didn't have an honest face. And you? Do you have an honest face? Well, I wouldn't trust you even with the Eiffel Tower. Why are we wasting time? All the evidence indicates that she is guilty. Let's get this over with and go home. Sure, typical of voc�. Just because you want to know where your wife is... that is no reason to force us to convict an innocent. Espere a�, Sr. Morestan. You can understand a lot about bicycles and other goods you sell... Victrolas, records and sheet music. But it cannot dictate what our verdict will be. Take the Bluebeard case, for example. In that case, it is clear that justice was not done. And if we're not careful, the same thing will happen again now. The man had killed his four wives. Now it's different. He has no murdered wife. You don't understand. I don't understand? You don't even know what case you're judging. E voc�? You! Do you know what case you are judging? Hmm... what is this? � my bride. What a sweeter thing. Thanks. You got married yesterday, didn't you? at 8:00. What a pity. And maybe we'll come the night here. So young. I understand your concern about what you're doing. from a family of artists. Do you know what that means. What did you say? I was referring to Natalie Roguin. French father sem�eh�ngara. Your past jobs can prove something. Waitress, cashier, manicurist, model... Why were you never a nurse or a teacher? Why have you never been a dancer? This comment has no logic. I followed this case in detail. I have all the data. Look here. Rent: 2,000 francs. Clothing: 18,000 francs. October 16, October 20... Just numbers, you little accountant... So shall we condemn an ​​innocent person just because she is a mathematician? Please! Don't scream in my ear. You are sensible. I am entitled to my opinion. Sure. This if you had one. But unfortunately it's confusing. Not seeing or hearing clearly. Little do you know what's going on around you. You're exaggerating. It's no use. I give up. I still have my doubts. In dubio pro defendant. I still think she's guilty. If this is your opinion then we will continue here. We will remain only to help you tarnish the image of justice. But I warn you that I won't leave here until I can absolve you. Not if we all get pneumonia. guilty. Innocent. Innocent. guilty. Innocent. guilty. Innocent. So, can we hear the voice of reason? Mr. Lurette, what's your opinion? I don't know. Still don't know? For you everything is easy. Why don't you try to explain why Gilbert Marigner tried to kill her cousin? What cousin? The one who lives on Rue St. Sulpice, 40. Poor guy. He didn't understand anything that happened. It was not before. H�? Let me explain. Come here. Once upon a time, a boy and a girl met on a rainy day. They became friends and it looked like they would live happily ever after. More to poor mo�a, �rf�... alone in the world, she discovered that her only friend had become her enemy. We think you are innocent. The frog is acquitted. You know what? I think we were wrong. One moment, I was looking for you. Yes, I wanted to thank you for everything you've done. Without you, the case would have ended very differently. I just did my duty. None of that. It helped a lot. I'd like to know what she's going to do. Who? A Srta. Roguin. Ah, a Srta. Roguin. If I were to worry about the future of all my clients... I don't know, the same as the others. Vaudeville, cabarets... Well, I've been thinking... maybe she needs some help. Could you tell him that I'm willing to help in any way I can? Take my card. So that's it. Oh, n�o. Sorry, Mr. Morestan. I will gladly deliver it. Thanks. How are you? Hello. This is my fiancee, Lucille Moray. How are you? We want to trade our bikes for a tandem. This is with my father. You better get in. Are you getting married soon? Oh yeah. Any of these days. We can't wait. She immediately blushes. Hello, Mr. Morestan. Hello, my friend. Did you come back again? Let's get married. This is my bride. Congratulations. How can I help you? We want to trade our bikes for that tandem one. Like the one I had. Your life is pretty unstable, huh? It's hard to talk riding different bikes. It's true, Mr. Morestan. We spent our Sundays meters away. I understand well, father. Imagine you and mom on different bikes yelling at each other: I love you! That's right. You are very understanding, Miss... Fran�oise. Miss Fran�oise. Where is your mother? In the kitchen. fast. Take the tandem. It's yours. Oh! Thank you. That's the one I was talking about. Better than I expected. Now we can have fun. By the way. Soon you will need one of these. Com certeza. Voltaremos semana que vem. Mas n�o quero apress�-los. S� se precisarem... Adeus. Adeus. Boa sorte. Melhor n�o falar com sua m�e sobre isso... n�o � bom para os neg�cios. N�s, isto �... Eles v�o se casar. Parece que todo mundo est� se casando. E ganhando bicicletas tamb�m. Quando vai falar com Robert sobre o dote? E ent�o? Ent�o o qu�? Falamos depois. Lurette, meu amigo. Como vai? Ainda estou livre. E voc�? Bem, bem. Quero que conhe�a minha filha, Fran�oise. Este � Lurette, meu colega de juri. Como vai, Sr. Lurette? Como vai? Tem uma filha linda. Uma mo�a feita. Dezoito anos. E tr�s meses. Logo ser� av�. S� se ele se decidir logo. O que acha de um pai que se recusa a discutir... assuntos importantes com seu futuro genro? Bem... Que futuro existe em curso de dan�a? Se quer casar, tem que aprender a se sustentar. O que v�o fazer ap�s o casamento? Dan�ar? Dance course a lot of money. Everyone likes it: tango, rumba, carioca. If Robert sets up a studio, with my dowry... Imagine if I'm going to tie my money in a dance studio. Would you do that? I think that... Don't you see that we have a customer? This is not the time to discuss family matters. Now excuse me. We'll talk about that later. Goodbye, Mr. Lurette. Goodbye. Wow, it's hard to be a father of a family. would not know. It's a big responsibility. It's true, Mr. Morestan. By the way... When they open the studio they may need a counter. I'm free, you know. There will be no new studio. Why not? Sounds like a good proposal. How are we going to know? Rumba, tango... Andrew They're calling you on the phone. Meet you. is a woman. One more reason for you to attend. Said it was a personal matter. Personal? With me? Who would have personal business with me? If you don't know, how can I know? Why don't you keep a schedule for this sort of thing? Schedule? What are you talking about? For the first time in my life I receive such a call and I am already called Casanova. Maybe I better go. no. I'll be back in a moment. I'll be back another day... No, wait a moment. I know what you're thinking, but you're wrong. Even so, it is better to close the door. Al�? Al�. � Mr. Morestan? Yes. Here is Natalie Roguin. H�? Remember? Spoke to my lawyer... It was so kind. I waited as long as I could. Yes, I understand. What a pity. She knew this would happen. no. I don't care one bit. Yes, I'll be there in 15 minutes. Well, I'm tall and I'm nice looking... Well, what nonsense. I can recognize it. Yes, I will leave immediately. Give me the key to the box. I'll take 200 francs. Now you're giving money to women? How many times have I said I don't want this statue here? Cupid in a bike shop. Watch out, Andre... If you were going to do what you're thinking, you'd be wearing my Derby, wouldn't you? If you're going on a date, be careful. Now, Michelle, you know I've never done that to you. From to war. Sr. Morestan! Oh, Lurette! I had forgotten. But I'm in a hurry. I need to talk to you specifically about... Then follow me. What it is? From the case of Natalie Roguin. H? I think... which direction are you going? In which direction are you going? North Zone. I'm going south. What a pity. Come back another time and we'll talk about it. Nobody wants to give me a job because of what happened. It's not fair. She was acquitted. I don't want to embarrass you. I actually feel... I thought I might... Oh, no. Thank you, but I can't accept. Why not? I don't need it. That's not why I called him. I know, you want to work. Well, nothing stops me from offering you a job. Why don't you come work with me until something better comes along? Do you think there would be no problem? This is... with so many people coming to your store. Someone might recognize me. It would be embarrassing for you. That doesn't concern me. But it should. I've been through this. It was not pleasant at all. And it won't be for you. Go home. Oh, I forgot you don't have a home. Well, there's enough space in our house. I don't see why you don't come live with us. Are you sure what you're doing? Yes, I have. We'd better change your name. Don't you think you should hire someone to help you? Give time. You just get used to it. You will never get used to it. How can you know? Anyone can see that it won't help at all. You and your certainties. Just look. Where did you find her? I said. She is the daughter of an old colleague. Georges Frehring. Had to go to Africa. So he left it with me. Couldn't I take her along? Now, Michelle. Would you like me to take Fran�oise to a country full of... cannibals, crocodiles and ts�-ts�? Wouldn't I like to have a friend I could leave my daughter with? Ol�, m�e. That is, if I had to go to Africa without my daughter. What story is this? Don't ask me any more questions. Anyone going to travel? no. Your father is the one who hired a girl to break everything in the store. really? Yes. Are you pretty? Yes. And as if that weren't enough, he's going to live here. I had to house her in her study room. �? �! �, �, �... Ol�. How can I help you? Sim? Don't worry, I... I'm from the family. Which one of these � Georges? It is. This one is Marcel. I remember him. No, this one. Did you meet the new girl? Yes. Looks like she's the daughter of an old friend of his. Said this is the father. He looks a lot like his father. H�? Where was Jeanne until now? What Jeanne? Now this, the girl you brought. Ah, and Jeanne. He spoke Joan, Joan ... Sometimes it is impossible to understand what you say. How did it get here? I remember keeping it in the back room. Do you need to follow me wherever I go? Joan, Joan ... Something wrong, Pierre? No, it's fine. So why don't you go to sleep? Because I'm not sleepy. I know what's bothering you. He didn't take his eyes off Jeanne all through dinner. You are imagining things. I am? And I say more. I think you're in love. what? It's screaming. Love at first sight. You have all the symptoms. Don't be silly. You're going to tell me that you actually hate her... But I know that deep down... You're crazy. So why did you drop everything during dinner? Forks and knives. It is one of the most common symptoms of love at first sight. And why... Stop talking like a child. You don't know what kind of girl she is. Love at first sight... I'll tell her to leave today. You don't know what you're talking about. Yes I know. And the sooner the better. I do not fa�a anything that a magoe. I thought I was talking to someone. Was. With myself. She was reading aloud. Don't like to do that sometimes? Do what? Read aloud. sometimes yes. Is this book yours? It is the first time I read about astronomy. It's very interesting. I see you think so too. This is your room, isn't it? �. I hope you don't hate me for dislodging you. N�o. Everything is fine. Your sister says you're going back to the university in the winter. Yes. In January. Then you will learn all about the stars, the planets and everything up there. It won't be everything. Isn't it a very difficult science? no. It's pretty simple. Once you learn the basics, the rest is easy. For example, what is it? The planets are reduced by 250 million in relation to their actual size. This is Saturn, here Jupiter and Mars. Would love to know more. Mind if I read your book? I promise to take care. Of course you can. I have a telescope over there on the roof. One day we might... You could go up to look through it. Thanks. Didn't say why you came here. Hm? Oh, I... I came to get this. It broke? No, it's fine. I hope I didn't bother you. N�o, n�o. Good night. Good night. The candle! Set the sail. So. It's beautiful on the outside. A professional could not have done better. Thanks. Glad you liked it. We need more snow there. More snow? You command. I wanted to see if you're happy. Hello, my friend. Hello, Mr. Morestan. Nice to see you. I thought I would never come back. I didn't have time. Fortunately it was working. Now, unfortunately, I'm back... Do you remember the last time I was here... I wanted to talk but you were so rushed... This bike looks really old... Don't you think you need a new one? No thanks. I'm free again and... maybe even have it fixed. Mr. Morestan, I want to talk to you. We better go in. Lurette, vo... Lurette, you don't know what you're missing. These new models please any cyclist. They are a marvel in every aspect. They are more than just a means of transportation... Yes, I've been thinking. I think we were wrong. I've been re-examining the case... and certain facts make me believe that we have reached a wrong verdict. We did not analyze the time elapsed between Gilbert's first and second visits. As little as I understand science... You still haven't met my wife. Yes, I think I've had the pleasure. I mean... Lurette is a fellow judge. Nice to meet you. Is it the case that acquitted Roguin? That's what I was talking about. Mr. Morestan... Mr. Lurette is an accountant. We helped to absolve her, but we made a big mistake. Mr. Lurette served in the Bluebeard case. A very important judgment. Why don't you tell her? This is not the Bluebeard case. I did a lot of research and now I know she is guilty. He doesn't know anything. I thought to myself and discovered that she forced the boy to steal from his father. You think and talk too much. She forced him to steal 30,000 francs from his father. The case is closed. It might be for you. But dangerous and loose, cases like this can be repeated. Let me understand. Are you implying that I convinced you to acquit a guilty person? Yes. And he also convinced himself. Are you calling me a fool? Yea! No, it's not that. No, but that's what I meant. Walk into my shop with a bike falling apart... and pretends he wants to fix it. You still dare to make me a clown in front of my wife. Andr�, how can you? I must ask you never to set foot here again. And if you pass through here, let it be on the other side of the street. Mas, Sr. Morestan... My bike... Across the street! Well, well, the mystery woman. Misterious woman? For me yes. What goes on behind those dark eyes? I would like to find out someday. Or night. What was it? What would Fran�oise say out of such curiosity? We think about it another time. I can say that I am teaching her to dance. J� be dan�ar. As a family friend, I can teach for free. Jeanne is going to take dance lessons with me. Thank you, but no need to worry. Do you see something wrong with that? N�o. I want to talk to you. Let's go to the storeroom. Ol�, m�e. Hey, darling. Where's daddy? I don't know. Giving bikes, scaring away customers... I don't know what got into him. Maybe it's in the storeroom. You don't know what we escaped from. Did you see who showed up? Yes, I've seen that. Man is a pest. Do you know I'm here? no. But the way he's talkative, anything can happen. With so many lies, I don't think I can tell my wife the truth anymore. I'm leaving, Mr. Morestan. N�o, n�o... No, my daughter. Don't cry. I'll find a way. Will be all right. I better go back. Don't worry. Did you see Pierre? no. It's your search. You just find me. Did you see Jeanne? Why, do I have to see everyone today? Calm. I have a right to know where my maid is. Besides, she's pretty weird. I was just talking to a taxi driver. And yes. It could be a customer. They spoke Hungarian. H�ngaro? How's it going? Well... Do you understand Hungarian? No. I understand how you know he was Hungarian? Wants to know? It was a dialect spoken in southern France. Dialect? Didn't you say your father was from the south? Well, there they speak in dialect. The driver must be from there. And being from the south, he spoke in his language. � poss�vel. Poss�vel? Do you know who he is? is an international spy disguised as a driver. He's come to steal a secret from our bikes for a foreign power. He was from the south and spoke in dialect. That's all. Michelle. You don't believe me, do you? N�o. I didn't think I would. My wife is the best cook in France. Your stew is a work of art. Thank you thank you. Are you feeling better? That's great. If Fran�oise pulls my hand, I'll also enjoy good cooking. Will you marry for the food, �? And why not? Good food goes well after marriage. Some even marry for it. Others for the dowry. And others for other reasons. In our case, it's love, isn't it? What do you think? Wait 25 years to be sure it was out of love. I didn't know he was a philosopher, Andr�. Don't laugh at me, I know what I'm talking about. I am authority in love I should write a book on the subject. Don't forget to include a chapter on people who kill for love. As well? French youth want to be heard. Every day we read the news of women who kill out of passion or jealousy. Isn't it true? Pass the salt. I should know. You yourself served as a juror in such a case. Your father doesn't like to talk about it. Looks like they got the wrong verdict. A fellow juror of his was here today and said that. Lurette n�o sabe de nada. And why do you believe anyone? It's delicious, isn't it? Come on, eat. It's not the only one. Many say she should have been sentenced. That's the problem. There is a lot of talk and listening, but no one thinks. They accuse her of murder, but even if she is acquitted, everyone condemns her. Why were you so nervous? I'm not nervous. After all, she was no good. Let the stew burn. And too salty. Where are you going, Jeanne? I don't feel... That is, I'm satisfied. Excuse me. Something is bothering you. It always looks like you've been crying. I'm satisfied too. What's happening? What's happening here? Jeanne, Pierre... It's very clear to me. Ent�o explains to me. Can't you see they're in love? what? I knew it. And if it's quick, we can celebrate a wedding together. nonsense. I don't want to talk about it anymore. Not at weddings. Why not? Yes, why not? Pass the salt. There is always salt in the food. And from now on, murders are no longer discussed during dinner. I will get up too. And I'm not satisfied. Not cold? Not much. I know why you left the room just now. Sim. Natalie Roguin. It may seem strange to you, but I want you out of this house as soon as you can. But before you go... I'm leaving today, Pierre. Yes, it will be better. I cannot culp it. After all, I was tried for murder. no. She was acquitted and I have always believed in her innocence. So why? Because my father brought her here. And because I saw them in the supply room this afternoon. And I want to spare my mother grief. You fool. You should be ashamed to suspect your father. The kindest person I've ever met. You brought me just to protect myself, nothing more. I was desperate. He knew it was risky, but he brought me. He knew what they would think and say. Even so, he insisted. I expected that from anyone. But not from you, Pierre. What could I think? He is so absorbed in his scientific facts that he only understands what he reads in his books. Can't think of anything else. I will, Pierre. But believe your father, please. I believe. Not yet, Natalie... Have you seen the moon? That is, through the telescope. The night is beautiful. Come, I'll show you. It has many mountains and craters. Different from ours. Come. Sit here. To the naked eye we call them "The man in the moon". Sit here. We call it "The Man in the Moon". The moon is 2,160 miles in diameter and is the closest body to us in the sky. How do you know that? I have read your books. How did you know that I... I was at the trial. But he never told anyone. N�o. Your kindness. Not yet, please. Wouldn't you like to see Venus before you go? Sim. It is unmistakable for its shine. When the ancient Greeks saw him in the sky, they called him Callixtus. Which means "the most beautiful". A very appropriate name. Quick, hide your face. Idiot Lurette is over there. What is that fake one doing in church? Only gone to count the candles. What is he talking about? Find out what your dad is talking about. Mom wants to know what Dad is talking about. Dad... Mom wants to know what you're talking about. Said they're singing out of tune. Said they're singing out of tune. They are singing out of tune. They are singing out of tune. Where you go? I can't stay here. Hang on. I don't feel well. Fran�oise. Looks like there was a problem. Go see what happened. She is not feeling well. I'll see what. Natalie. Why did you run away? One of the jurors was there. I was afraid you would see me. Let him see. If you come talk to me. Let speak. You have to lose that fear of people. It will be my wife. Mrs. Pierre Morestan. Sounds cute, doesn't it? Ah, Peter. Or prefer Sra. Natalie Morestan? I cannot marry you. Why not? What would your mother say when she finds out? There's only one important thing. Do you love me? Come on, say. Loves Me? It has nothing to do with it. I can't. I'm going to talk to Dad today. When you give your blessing, you will soon change your mind. Go. Sr. Morestan. I have nothing to say and I ask you not to say anything to me. But... Did you hear right? We have nothing to talk about. I saw it very well. All through the mass he was winking at my wife. me blinking? What are you talking about, Andr? Lurette, you should know that church isn't barracks. He arrives. Subject closed. Full stop. What do you have against the poor? He never winked at me. How can you know. You didn't see it. I kept an eye out. I wanted to talk about the bike. Must have winked at you. Well, I don't want you to wink at me. But... Go apologize to him. Tell him Morestan isn't feeling well. Everything is fine. I'll be right back, Fran�oise. Where is your mother? Come down soon. Feel better, Jeanne? Yes, thank you. That's great. Did you like the Mass? Yes. But it made me hungry. Robert and Fran�oise could hurry so we could have dinner soon. Can you excuse us? I need to talk to Dad. Well ... Hm? I'm getting married. � natural. � s�rio. As I said, it's natural. I'm going to marry Jeanne. At your age, I also wanted to get married for Christmas. Seriously. Jeanne and I decided to get married. And I decided to send him back to college after the holidays. I'm asking for your permission. And even if I don't get it, I'll get married. She knows? Sure. I understand. Well, I say it won't. why? Well, because... Because she's Natalie Roguin. How long have you known? I was at the trial. I understand. Ent�o? Ent�o n�o! No. I will not allow. There's no reason for that. I brought her here because he believed in her. Yes. He wanted to help her. And I still do. But not like daughter-in-law. If you were at the trial, you must know why. I may have been foolish, but don't make me regret it. Subject closed. That's all you have to say. Subject closed! Everything is fine. Are you hungry? no. But stay when you know what's for dinner. I face. Ol�. Ol�. How are you, my little love? Didn't show up for private lessons at night. Said he didn't have time. What a pity. We could have a lot of fun. I just met a friend of yours. He knew her before she was called Jeanne. Looks like you lost your rush. Chama-se Lurette. Say something? He served as a juror in a certain trial. You don't have to act like that with me. Please let me go. Stop Please! Why does no one answer this door? What is it? Let him go! How do you explain this? It was his fault. I was just having fun with her... and he entered as a musketeer defending his wife's honor. Go to your room. He heard? And you go away. With pleasure. We will! I will. I didn't really want to stay. You have no right to speak like that. Why don't you tell him she's Natalie Roguin? Explain what she is doing here. Get out soon! Now you know. I only brought her in to help her. I felt sorry for her. Don't believe me? I believe. Tome. And I shouldn't have brought the girl here either. But now to new life. It passes. Oh, mother! Calm calm... I want to leave here and forget everything. You can go visit your Aunt Charlotte. Amanh�? Sim, amanh�. Don't you think you should talk to Pierre? no. I have already said what is necessary. But he loves her. Everyone loves each other here. The house is a paradise for those who love. Entitled to a "Romeo and Juliet" just for me. But enough. From now on we will only sell bicycles. Natalie! Goodbye, Pierre. I'll go with you. It shouldn't. You shouldn't because I don't love you. I don't believe it. But you have to believe. Did I interrupt something? I was saying goodbye to Pierre. Saying goodbye? Pierre needs bad to say goodbye? And of this? Voc�? Sim. My own son stealing from me? Please! It's your fault, your... You've done the same before! Natalie! Pierre. Andr�... I need to report a tragedy. A horrible tragedy. Don't take it seriously, he's drunk. This is common on holidays. Only you. She saves her life and six months later tries to kill her. Made my son a thief. It's a good girl. He stole from me. The culprit is her. Where is she? Pierre is with him. Don't worry. It wasn't serious. The sooner you leave, the better. If she goes, Pierre will go with her. Let it go. I don't care. But, I yes. And I will not allow you to make Pierre suffer. I have nothing more to say. She leaves! If you want, he can come along. Is this how you feel? Yes, �. Then I will go too. I will leave in the morning. What do you want? I came to get the bags. Bad? Yes. We do not sell more... What do you mean suitcases? There must be a mistake. It's not a mistake. We're not ready yet. Can you come back in an hour? Of course. Your food is burning. Lure! I just wanted my bike... Glad you came. He was absolutely right about the girl. We shouldn't have acquitted her. We shouldn't... what? What happened? Well, what didn't happen. She forced Gilbert Marigner to steal his father's money. Now you've made my son steal from me. And tried to run away with him. Sorry, Mr Morestan, but I... I don't mean to say that I prevented it... but again no justice was done. If you analyze the facts again... I don't need to, I already told you to leave. Although? But this is wrong. Definitely. why? You are preparing a new tragedy. She is dangerous and should be hospitalized. But what can I do? I don't know... Why don't you go to the President of the Court and tell him everything. The President of the Court? Yea... � your responsibility. It's all your fault. She got us into this situation. You have to act fast. You're right. It's what I should do. But... Then do it. Among. Oh sorry. Come in, come in. Did you want to talk to me? Yes sir President. You can talk. I'm the fifth juror. Fifth juror? Yes. No caso de Natalie Roguin. Oh yes, now I remember. How can I help you? After the trial, I offered to help Natalie Roguin. It was kind of you. Thanks. It was half Hungarian, half French. I gave her a job and took her into my home. Don't say! It did very well. But it was a big one... Because the credit is all yours. I was 100% right. Of course? 100%. New evidence confirms this. But how did he know? New evidence? Yes. After the trial we discovered other evidence. Letters written by Gilbert Marigner. They proved that he was determined to kill Natalie and then kill himself. Yes, you helped save an innocent girl. 100% innocent. Lucky that girl, sir... What is your name? Andr� Morestan. Andr� Morestan... You are a good man, Mr. Morestan. Yes Yes... Thank you sir. The credit is his. 100%. Thanks. I know I've changed it twice. But if he talked to his father, he could explain. I can try. Would like to help. I knew it. Voc� � legal... Do you understand what I mean? Was your mother gone? It will go down. Dad! Would it be possible... Hello, hello. Hello, Mr. Morestan. He wants to trade the tandem for the other bike. Again? Changing into kids, Mr Morestan... Me and my girlfriend... we took different directions. And it would be boring to walk alone in a tandem. Yes, very dull. Voc� resolve, Fran�oise. I have to take care of something else. All right, dad. There it is. Yes, I'm on my way out. Are you decided, Michelle? Yes, as soon as the taxi arrives. Any chance to change your mind? N�o, Andr�. Now now. I came back again. How are you, Mrs. Morestan? Did you speak to the President? Certainly. Did you talk all about Natalie Roguin? Yes, and he also told me a lot. I knew from the start. She doesn't. Nothing. Don't talk like that about my future daughter-in-law. Daughter in law? Yes, daughter-in-law, Mr. Blue Beard. Mr. Accountant, Mr. Analyst, Mr. Moron! Nora? Hm-hmm. Hm-hmm. Hm-hmm. Hm-hmm. Legends: Luís Filipe Bernardes
