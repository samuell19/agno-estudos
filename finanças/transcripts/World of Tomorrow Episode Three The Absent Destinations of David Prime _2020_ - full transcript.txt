Hello David I am a backup copy of a person who was onced named Emily You are the original source of a clone that Emily would fall in love with over 400 years from now They were married I have searched time for you, but with my limited resources, this is the only version of you I could find. You are very young. I've saved for many years to be able to purchase this one-way time travel. This inverted memory of me will only reveal itself to you as you look at time in your life, like a distant message in a bottle. Bottle I've inherited wonderful memories of you, but we've never met. I've missed you dearly. I've written you a love poem. It is called, Will you be the one to discover my dead body? As we grow old together, our faces will slowly melt. One day, these warm hands will turn cold. Will you be the one to discover my dead body? Deep into your future, when your final clone dies, Emily will harvest your memories. This will include many of the buried memories of the clones of the Davids that preceded him, and I believe I am the only copy of Emily to have inherited those memories from her. Please let me prove this to you. When you were only 13 years old, you nearly drowned in the lake behind your home, and if that were not bad enough, as your head slipped beneath the surface, your entire adolescent life flashed before your eyes, totally humiliating you for a second time. To this day, you still suffer from nightmares of drowning. At night, your memories of them will often replay in my own dreams. I confess that I sometimes look forward to drowning together when I turn out the light. But have you ever seen a group of insects drown, David? The ones that are still struggling are the ones that are still alive. When you have access to interstellar travel, it is very important that you retrieve your clones' memories from me. I've uncovered something critical that I believe Emily had never known. I will now embed the long-term memory of this visit into your young brain, along with a compressed file of more detailed instructions. I will always remember you, David Prime. I may never be able to encounter a version of you again, but maybe it is possible for one of our distant copies to one day reunite. They would be so happy to see each other. It doesn't matter that you don't know me yet, or if you won't remember me later. The shadows of ourselves once had their moment, in time. Hello david I apologize if you have trouble accessing this message as it slowly unpacks into your brain. Your primitive neural implant technology may encounter storage problems. Accessing all the information that I have compressed for you here, I will hide David's memories on an abandoned mining planet, beyond the red nebula of the lower Gemini system. It is highly illegal for me to leave behind technology that does not yet exist in your time, so it is very important that it is only you who can discover these secret materials. David, I am sorry that in order to afford the high cost of this process, I had to embed this memory with advertisements and sponsored content. I hope you do not find them to be too intrusive. The safest place for you to land is at the base of the crater you will find at these coordinates. It will then be a day's walk northwest through the desert mountains to retrieve the package I have left for you. On the side of the rock up ahead... On the side of the rock up ahead, I've drawn for you a bunny face. You must venture through the treacherous mountain tunnels ahead, where you must take great care to avoid the moaning cave worms of the lower emotions. Please be extremely careful navigating these tunnels, David. it is said Please be extremely careful navigating these tunnels, David. It is said that if a single drop of the cave worm's poisonous saliva makes contact with a man's skin, his tongue will fall out and he will make uncontrollable, horrifying screaming noises for the rest of his life. Sometimes I don't think I like eating eggs. I think it must be some sort of texture thing. I just don't enjoy squashy foods like I think I should. I feel like I should like avocados more whenever I see spacecraft overhead. I fantasize about it exploding so I could be the person to describe the accident to investigators. Is that strange? I love women that tell me how much they pay for pieces of clothing that they're wearing after I've complimented them on it. It makes me feel like I am their friend. Or could be. If we ever meet again, I want you to know that I do not like to be hugged. I don't enjoy it at all. I never feel hugged. I feel restrained. If you ever want to hug me, please just touch my arm instead. You may encounter what appear to be corpses of yourself in these mountains. Please do not be alarmed. Your neural chip will now detect and tastefully blur out any dead bodies from your line of sight so your brain does not panic. It is possible that distant backup clones of yourself from unknown timelines will have inherited fragmented pieces of the powerful message I've implanted in you today, not understanding the full context of why they should have memorized this planet's coordinates and terribly haunted by your memories of my beautiful face. Some of your clones, or clones of those clones, may have desperately time-traveled here to random points in time, one by one, to try and solve the mystery of why these mountains loom so impossibly large in their subconscious minds. They may have even dressed like you in a sad attempt to better connect with their broken dreams. If they did not have the finances to return home to their own timelines, they will surely have wandered here hopelessly until they died of exposure, a strange flow of unknown Davids drawn here like moths to a flame. I doubt you will encounter more than one or two of them. And you needn't worry, David. These would not have been the clones that will ever carry your primary consciousness. They are only confused copies who have reenacted the echoes of your behavior, their David Prime from long ago. Do you think they had nightmares about drowning? I have implanted the decided coordinates of your destination today in a separate neural home beacon that will delete the short-term memory of where it guides you next. This way, only you, the correct David, will ever be led to the exact location of what I have left behind, in the correct place and at the correct time, and these other Davids will have no memory of where to go. Here is a list of all the things that make me happy. One. Happiness. Two. Sunlight. Three, water. One hundred and seventy two, photos of extinct animals. One hundred and seventy three, successful medical procedures. One hundred and seventy four, three O five, the color blue and the smell of smoke. Three O six, miniature birds. 307. Imagining the deaths of everyone who's ever offended me. 308. Looking at my feet in the morning light. Hello, David, You have reached the beacon, this is the beacon. Welcome to the beacon, here we are at the beacon. Look, it's the beacon. To soften the crippling shock of the terrifying information I am about to give you, this machine will temporarily stun your brain and reduce it to a childlike open-minded state. You may notice a simplification of your point of view. In 72 years from your point in time, cloning will become commercially available. When your body is ready to die, your consciousness will be directly transplanted into a new one. In case of emergencies, cheap backup copies are traditionally cloned at the same time as children or adults. Although their brains will house backup memories, these numbered clones are not intended to inherit your primary consciousness and generally used for labor, organ donation, or long-term storage. It is common for backups to suffer deteriorations. One of your backup copies will severely drool, but the only lineage you need to worry about is your own. The one clone who will always carry your primary consciousness. David, here is what I've learned so far from your final clone's memory disk, recovered from Emily. Two generations from now, after the invention of time travel, one of your backup copies will be employed as a secret agent called a cleaner. A cleaner has the special ability to travel in between time. It is helpful to think of time advancing like the frames of an ancient cinema reel. Cleaners have access to restricted technology that allows them to freely move between the frames. In a shadow realm, not even visible to view screens. With these tools, a construction crew of clones and robots can quietly work for decades, in between time, and build an entire city, in what appears to be an instant to the rest of us. The job of a cleaner is much more sinister. Shrouded in mystery, they monitor and resolve any problematic time travel paradoxes that could be created by the public by quietly working behind the scenes. Cleaners are even rumored to carry out secret assassinations whenever necessary to maintain the balance of time. Using devices that spontaneously induce heart failure or brain aneurysms. Clean, undetectable murders from another dimension. Something bad happens to your backup clone, David. A time traveling job will deliver him to the future, where he will accidentally cross paths with another David. Your future self. David 4 grows obsessed with this David's life, and follows him relentlessly. He falls in love with the woman this clone is married to. A woman he met in a museum. Emily. He is haunted by her. There is something impossibly familiar about her. He abandons his team, and spends endless days in between time, studying her face. Drunk with jealousy, he hatches an evil plan. David 4 will find the perfect moment to murder future David. Pull his body in between time, though it will be hidden forever. And instantly take his place in David's timeline, while Emily's back is turned. We only know about this nefarious plot because his source clone, your future self, that generation's David, his roommate, will read his diary. Left behind in their apartment following David 4's unexplained disappearance the night before. David realizes his future is at stake, and in turn, draws. If David 4 succeeds in murdering David's next self, the direct lineage of your consciousness will end forever, and only the backup Davids will live on. David also knows that David 4 would not murder him, as doing so would prevent the next David from ever existing, and therefore the opportunity for any of them to ever meet Emily. But David also knows that he cannot travel back in time to try and stop David 4 at any point in the past, because David 4 would always be one step ahead of him, using his god-like powers in in-between time. David decides that his only hope is to find a way to travel in between time himself, and directly confront his backup copy in the in-between future. The experiment with the consumer time travel hack. After many decades, he finally tests his modified hack on his remaining backup copy, but it malfunctions, and merely transports his skeleton to an unknown location. Death was instantaneous. Probably. Out of money and options, David desperately places himself in a stasis tube for the maximum span of 100 years, in the hope that technology will have advanced enough for him to find a way to travel between time. But the stasis tube seems to have only led to further mental decline. He satirically places a young clone of himself in a museum, and titles the display, Time is a Prison of Living Things. It is unknown where or when David creates his next primary clone. It is unknown why that next David did not act on these memories and continue working on the time hack himself. One day, our David simply vanishes from the public record. But not before writing a message on his wall. Death is not a destination, it is the absence of one. I'm afraid this is all I was able to discover. The memories are a jumbled mess to me, and the emotions are very strong. Only your own brain can play them back with any clarity, because it is the anatomical structure from which they will one day originate. I have stored David's memories inside of Zorgbot, who I've hidden at the top of the ridge behind me. Zorgbot is a delightful robot companion from the future, who will be able to beam all of the memories into you remotely. Zorgbot can be activated by pressing the black button on the back of his head. My message to you will continue from there. This machine will now restore your perception of reality back to its original state. I am Zorgbot Hello David, these are the memories to the in-between time calculations the future David was working on before he went mad I have also included some information about time travel devices from my own era. if you continue his work using these ecumiliated memories perhaps some day you will be able to travel to the in-between future, and save your lineage by stopping the assassin at the point in time in Emily's memory where we know David will be killed David, please know that to this day many still argue that it is not logically possible to change past or future events through time travel and if it is, wether the ? would allow such a thing to happen please be careful, I love you perhaps there is still hope somewhere in the ocean of time for David and Emily Good luck Behold! we'll have a rabbit! and a shark! a universe! it's a bunny! a butterfly! what's that? what's that? I knock your tower out I don't know, a pig! I drop it in the ocean in the ocean we have a car and and a ? in it a TV! a turtle goes on a bunny it's a woodpecker! not on my face! oh no! you are once more part of a whole like the scattering seeds of a pretty flower a bunny! David! please note that to this day many still argue that it is not logically possible to change past or future events through time travel. and if it is wether the would even allow for such a thing to happen please be carefu. I love you. perhaps there is still hope somwhere in the ocean of time for David and Emily Good luck. Hello David
