Breaking news... ..update you on a major earthquake... The 8.1-magnitude quake... ..devastated the west side of Malawi outside Livingstonia. Hundreds of people have been killed or injured... ..displaced after their homes were destroyed. Fortunately, this unprecedented natural disaster did not occur in a more densely populated location, as the loss of life would have been much higher. The effects of this disaster are still being felt throughout the region... ..with a radius of more than 50 kilometres. Grand Power Energy Corporation... ..Grand Power Energy Corporation... ..Corporation Australia, commonly known as GPEC... REPORTER It is also the only major organisation close to the site with rescue resources. Peter Wu from GPEC joins us... Peter Wu from GPEC joins us now to talk about... ..this part of the world doesn't have the kind of infrastructure and resources to cope with an event like this. Representatives from GPEC are assessing the area... Funding is drying up across the board when it comes to humanitarian assistance in Africa... So how will GPEC be able to help? And that was Peter Wu from GPEC... Brilliant. Everything he says is on point. What do you think, Mark? I really hope he can be helpful to the people there. I know it's a challenge to fill in for Peter last minute, but entertaining the delegation is way better than being in Africa, am I right? Let's impress the Lvhan delegates tonight. Tomorrow, we send them off to Sydney and then China. Mission accomplished, mate. Anyway, it's just icing on the cake. Peter assured me it's all on the up and up, and he is our Chinese expert. As long as the delegation is happy. You and Peter are indeed very different. You're a family man. He's a workaholic with no attachments. - But I love you both. - Thank you. Mr Song! Welcome to the Twelve Apostles! I really respect your professionalism, Mr Song. It is our honour to work with your group. We're almost there. - Ms Zhou! How are you? - Ni hao. Sorry for making you work so hard when you're not feeling well, but I'm sure your husband will really appreciate it. Yes. He just wants me to let you know he's very happy. Excellent. Well, you take care of yourself. Mark. Everyone, Mark is our new Peter. He'll take good care of all of you. Great. Let's go have some fun, hey? Ms Zhou. Mr Song. Follow me. - Ms Zhou? - Thank you. Peter invited such a big group. I can't believe he actually knows them all. So, who's that? James. - Mr Song. - Oh, hey. I hope you're enjoying tonight's festivities. Mr Yang, congratulations on becoming a grandfather. Oh, thank you, thank you. Sorry. Peter, didn't your doctor tell you that diabetes and alcohol doesn't mix? And Ms Zhou, she has a cold. Neither of you should be drinking! Actually, this deal is very important. I'm just worried about Mark. His mind is never fully on the job. I should be the one working here. Mark, remember that time, the rowing race? We lost it all because you didn't check the gate. Why do you bring this up now? Mark... ..check the gate. Don't you know? It's the most important thing before a race. Peter, you must be exhausted. Let's talk about Africa tomorrow. I'm sorry. What you need is a good night's rest. Sorry. Mark, this deal is really important! Don't be stupid! Remember, check the gate! No mistakes! Sorry. Sorry, everyone. Sorry. He's a little tired. He's just had a big trip. Go ahead, have a good night, OK? Please... Huh... Hah! Uh... The tropical cyclone which caused the rainstorm this morning has passed through. Communications have been restored to the coastal regions, but emergency services will continue to work throughout the night... It has been confirmed this morning that a Gulfstream 650 aircraft belonging to Grand Power Energy Corporation, GPEC... ..and has crashed into the ocean near the Twelve Apostles. It is believed the plane took off sometime this morning between 9am and 10am, bound for its final destination in Sydney. Search and rescue aircraft located floating wreckage this afternoon after an extensive search of the ocean near the Twelve Apostles. So far, no survivors have been located. Mark? Mark? The chairman just asked you a question. Sorry. I was just thinking of the victims. Yes, of course. We all are. But let's not forget, we are under tight scrutiny right now. I'm concerned our company is facing some exposure. What exposure? The visit to the Twelve Apostles was not on the official agenda. The FCPA specifically forbids extravagant entertainment. And SEC has long arms. Siemens was once fined $160 million and charged with bribery. We cannot allow any hint of impropriety here. James, you were in charge. How do you explain this? I... I relied on Peter too much, our resident "China expert". He arranged everything. He said that when dealing with the Chinese, sometimes, you know... this was to be expected. James. Doing business in China... What was that? He said you should learn Chinese. Where is Peter? Yeah, I called him, but no answer. He was there last night... ..completely exhausted. Sorry. Mark, you're Chinese too. Doing business in China, are we expected to follow the same unwritten rules? Of course not. That would be highly unusual. So it seems like Peter made the wrong call. I know why Peter's not here. It appears to be suicide by insulin overdose. Suicide? Could it possibly be an accident? Long-term diabetics don't make mistakes like this. They know their dosage. Was he under any... unusual stress? Finances? Marriage? Work? What a coward. GPEC mourns each and every one of our Chinese colleagues taken in the plane crash. We send our sincere condolences to their loved ones and we are deeply saddened by the sudden departure of our dear friends. In addition, we have lost two outstanding members of our... Wo... Hmm. - Xiexie. - Xiexie. Fucking hell! How 'bout it, love? Come on. How about it? - Oh, you look nice. - Sorry. Sorry. Ohh... Ugh! Oh! Ugh... Fucking idiot! - Hah! - Whoa! Dickheads! What the...?! What's going on?! Hey, get out! Sorry, sorry, sorry! - Go on, go on, go! - Get out of here! Arggh! Ohh! Fuck! Ah... Mmm. Excellent. - Great job, Mark. - Thank you. Peter thought it would take months, but you proved him wrong. I'm sure Peter tried his best. Unfortunately, the mess he made at the Twelve Apostles almost cost us everything. But now with you on board, we have nothing to worry about, right? Oh, I hope not. Is there anything else we need to discuss here? Yes, if there's anything we should know, you need to tell us now. The MOU was signed. It went smoothly. Everything's fine. Oh, nothing. - We're done. Thanks. - Oh, thank you. Hello? If there's anything else, you know where to find me. Hello? Is he OK? Oi! Hey, are you right? Yeah, just get it done! Sorry. Over there! Hey! Careful! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Ohh! Fuck! Ahh. Huh. Hey, dude... Good luck. Good morning, Mark. Oh, I'll just... just change this. What's this? Oh, we received the package for Peter this morning. The front desk didn't know what to do with it, so they thought best to send it to his old office. Thank you, Rose. Oh, can you get a new SIM card for me? - I lost my old phone. - No problem. - May I take your jacket? - OK. Enjoy. Hey, Rose, can you check if Tom Baker's in our company? One moment, please. Africa. Malawi. No, we don't have a record of Tom Baker. Thank you. Yeah. Oh! No mistakes! Oh! Check the gate! No mistakes! Oh! Stopping for a red light? They must be fucking nuts! You're going the wrong way, you fucking idiot! Stop! We lost them. Search every motel that doesn't need ID. How do we find them? Check their house? What the fuck's wrong with you? He's with that woman. How can he go home? What idiot would do that? How could she be alive? I thought she was dead. F... - Go, go, go! Go, go! - Yes! Come on, come on! Ah, Mark! Welcome! Come on over. Thank you, darling. You are the best. How are you? All good, thanks. I'm here to pick up Daniel. His mother is worried. Oh, don't worry about them. Look at how happy they are. Sorry, but we really have to go. No problem. Bruce told me what good friends they are. He's welcome here anytime. Bruce! Daniel's going. Bruce! Say goodbye to Daniel and Mark! Bye, Daniel and Mark! Say goodbye. Bye, Mr Harrison. Bye, guys. Mark. Family is... everything. We worked hard for this, you and I. I'll see you Monday. Of course. Absolutely. I think they need it by Thursday... Let's get things started. Everyone here? Everyone but Mark. Mr Ma's office. Rose speaking. Yeah, Rose, Harrison speaking. Can you tell Mark that the meeting's started? Oh, Mr Harrison, Mr Ma is out on leave. His message says he's taking his accrued leave for a holiday. A holiday? Well, can you call him and tell him I'm looking for him? Oh, sorry, Mr Harrison. I have his mobile, waiting for a new SIM card. I have no way of reaching him. Well, Rose, do you know where he is? Uh, I do. His name's on the manifest for this shipment of the African relief supplies. And, uh, Rose, his assistant. I... I'm just seeing this now. Logan. How about an all-expense-paid holiday in Africa? - To do what? - Hunt. Oh! Arggh! Oh... Biker gangs can be pretty scary. Fortunately, you didn't fight him. Poor Tom. He was hit by a truck last month and died. Are you sure? Huh, it's not like a white guy gets hit here every day. Plus, he was an engineer for that big company GPEC. Are you Chinese? - Uh-huh. - Yes. Before he died, Tom met a Chinaman here. This was a crime. They were having an argument. I've had enough. - I'm done with you. - Tom, T... Tom! - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you for the flowers. He was the best man. He will always be in my heart. Thank you. Hello. Take your toy and play outside. I'm lucky to have my job as a cleaner. That's how I can raise my little ones. Don't worry about money. Here's a company cheque for Tom. I've seen it before. Tom said this money is no good. We can't take it. After the earthquake, he was mad. He said he couldn't work for you people anymore. Why? He said it was all in his report. What report? I don't know. He never brought work home. He... he always said home time is family time. What did Tom do exactly? He was the engineer in charge of checking the gate. "Check the gate." Check the gate. Don't you know? Where did he check the gate? Here. He sent me his location... ..so we could see each other. May I take a photo? - What's going on? - High alert. - Is it gonna take long? - No, not too long. - How are the kids? - Oh, they're driving me crazy. - All clear! - Go. Here we go. Hey! Don't wander around. How many times do I have to tell you? Wait. - Who are you? - Go! Guards! Guards! Security alert! Security alert! Area four! Corridor! Go! Security alert... Stop! Oh! Get him! Get him now! He's over there! He's over there! After him! After him! Run! That way! That way! Get him! He's over there! He's over there! Hey, you! Stop him! Stop him! Get him! Get him! Get him! Stop that! Get over there! Get them! Run! They're not up here. Search everywhere. Hey, you! Stop! Get back here! Go. Check up that way. They're not over here. Oh! Shh. Down here, down here, down here! Oh! Here. Oh! Huh! Thank you for lending us Tom's car. - It's here. - How long have they been gone? About four or five hours. - We'd better get a move on. - Go. Hi, Tom! This is Tom's car. Er, yeah. I'm his friend. Can you help me? - Ah. Yes, of course. - Thank you. Tom always stays here on work trips. Want to give it a try? There's no cell reception. Only the landline. But like my father said, the old way is the best way. I miss Tom. He came here last month to write a report and used up my last fax machine cartridge. We got drunk, talked all night. You said Tom faxed the report? Yes. He said he'd be back soon. Thank you! What are you doing, my friend? Ahh! Turn right! Turn right! Arggh! Logan! Logan! Are you alright? Are you alright? Wait! Don't go! Come back! Diamond! Diamond! Diamond! Hmm? Excuse me. May I have some? Of course. Thank you. One more, please. Sure. Thank you. Shit. Good morning. - Thanks for the watch. - Thank you. No worries. Hello? Mark, this is Harrison. Harrison? I know you have a copy of the report. Damaging the company's reputation has severe repercussions. - Bring it to me now. - I don't have it. How did you get my number? There's no need to lie. Ms Zhou is sitting right here. She gave me your number. She told me that you have a copy. She also told me that you two hooked up. Just bring me the report and I give you back the girl. Come to the Mzuzu Lubinga Hotel, room 408. Give her back? You can keep her! That woman is a liar, a snake! I made a mistake. She ruined my life! Listen. She fucked me! No, no, no. I fucked her! I fucked her! - She's nothing to me! - Mark, calm down. Mark! I'm the one who's taking care of you. Bring me that report, I give you the woman and the money back. It is a win-win situation. What money? Huh. You don't know? When you were sleeping, your little bird contacted her husband. The $10 million she wanted is already in your account. The money's in my account, huh? What is there to talk about? Do you think I'd share the money with that bitch? Do whatever you want. Money is indeed the root of all evil. Hey, guys. Can I talk to you for a minute? I got him. He's definitely not coming for her. He's heading away from us. Go. I want that report. Get it! You stay here. Hey! Hey! Brother! Hey, watch where you're going. Excellent. It seems he's come to an end. Sorry. Gotcha! Arggh! Hey! Come here, come here! MARK'S VOICE ON RECORDING: Watch where you're driving! - Next. - Passport and boarding pass. Thank you. Next. Thank you. - He's here! It's him! - Get the camera, the camera! - Hello, Mr Ma? - Mr Ma? Mr Ma, Matt Worthington from Hidden Truth. Comment, please? How is your relationship with your wife? Please, Mr Ma, what do you think of people who cheat on their spouses? Mr Ma, are you experiencing severe financial difficulty? What are you talking about? Do you think credibility is important, Mr Ma? Judy! Judy! Call me anytime. Anytime. Who is the other woman? Mrs Ma! ..Ma is not a whistleblower at all. He's just a blackmailer after financial incentives. Completely unethical... You're on Hidden Truth. Tell me, is it common... Fuck! ..the way that society views adultery is it can often be influenced by... Go away! No! Stop! No! Stop! Get out! - Go away! - Run, run, run! Daniel! - Go! - Daniel, Daniel... Judy! Go away! Tonight on Story Line, Grand Power Energy Corporation Australia is mired in more controversy - allegations of corruption levelled against senior executives and the man at the centre of it all. The sex scandal engulfing GPEC employee and Chinese citizen Ma Ke continues to escalate. Many Chinese communities in Melbourne are protesting, condemning his behaviour. The secretary general of the International Energy Alliance, Chai Chuyuan, will soon arrive in Australia and officially announce several high-profile business cooperations. According to sources, Melbourne is one of the principal stops on the visit. Poor Mark. I know those reporters are hounding you, but here, we take care of our own. Now... ..what can I do for you? I told my friends I'm heading to the company. If anything happens to me, they'll call the police. Oh, Mark, no. You've got this all wrong. Mark... I saw the site. We caused the disaster. Tom did a report. Report? And Harrison, he's fought hard to get this back because he didn't want anybody to use it against us. Any untruthful rumour right now would be very hard for the company. But you sent hit men. Your people were at my house. That's a fact. What? No. I swear, that wasn't us. We were after Zhou Wen the whole time. The company would never harm Daniel and Judy. Hello? Oh. Uh, Mr Ma. Uh, your interview? Yeah, of course. Two hours? Yeah, yeah, we'll be ready in two hours. - Alright, coming! - Let's go! He's going to the press. What do we do? Today, the city of Melbourne welcomes the arrival of Chai Chuyuan, the secretary general of the International Energy Alliance. Due to heightened security levels, there will be city-wide delays, especially at City Hall where there will be a dinner reception following an exhibition of a traditional Melbourne pastime, a rowing race. - Check the gates! - Check the gates! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Excuse me, miss? What's in your hand? Rubbish. Carry on. Mike check, mike check. Secretary Chai, distinguished guests, I warmly welcome you on behalf of all Australians. Your visit, sir, will further increase the cooperation between us. We have a proud history of developing energy projects... Hey! I'm Superman! - Wait here. - ..of cooperation... We have an intruder. - Secure all entrances. - Warwick, come to gate 1. We have a promising future in many fields of cooperation... During Secretary Chai's visit, we hope to sign many mutually beneficial agreements. Mr Chai is head of the International Energy Alliance. And even more... Hold this. Uh, even more, he is an outstanding representative of the Asia-Pacific region. Under his guidance, the IEA has continued to be a world leader in clean energy development... Excuse me. Where is the bathroom? Follow me. I got it. This way, please. In terms of energy resources... ..Australia is a key player on the world stage and I believe that with the support of the IEA, we will work together to develop new forms of energy to provide a brighter future... You can take the call in the green room. One moment, please. All clear. Please. Just straight ahead. Let him go! Get on the ground! You stupid bitch! You've ruined everything! Ah? The turmoil of the past two weeks is coming to a close. GPEC is being investigated by Australian authorities and the SEC from the United States. They're facing bribery, false representation, conspiracy to commit murder, surveillance abuse on every member of the Lvhan Hanmei Group delegation, and other criminal charges. If convicted, they may receive lengthy prison sentences and huge fines. Now, since you were let go from GPEC, they've withdrawn their sponsorship, so unfortunately we have to terminate the review process of you and your family. Your current visa expires in three months. You must leave Australia by then. "Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. "He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector. "A dark knight." We're so proud of you.
