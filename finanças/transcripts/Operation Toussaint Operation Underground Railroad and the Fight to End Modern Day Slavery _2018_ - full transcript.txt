(speaking foreign language) - We have a story that we love to talk about, a young boy on a beach who's throwing starfish into the ocean, older man approaches the young boy and says, boy what are you doing? He says, tide is low, the sun is high and if I don't get them all back into the ocean they're gonna shrivel up and die. The man points to the boy and says, look down the beach, look down the shoreline, there's millions of 'em or thousands of 'em. There's no way that you can get them all back. Do you think you can really make a difference? The young boy thinks for a moment then just starts tossing starfish back into the ocean. Turns to the older gentleman and says, I don't know, but I know I just made a difference for that one. - [Officer] Yeah it's right here you guys, right here, okay. Okay ready? (speaking foreign language) - [Officer] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! (speaking foreign language) - [Unseen Man] This is on my baby. (audience applauding) - Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen, thank you. Thank you, good morning. It's great to see this many of you out. Thank you each and every one of you who came out today to support Utah's efforts in the fight against this horrible, evil institution that we call human trafficking. With over 40 million modern day slaves world wide, thousands of them throughout the United States. And many of you have known about this issue and have been fighting against it and working here for years. Some even decades. This is an institution that's been around since the beginning of time. But it's really only now that the mainstream, that the public is starting to gain awareness and so, a little over four years ago a dear friend of mine who was a superstar in the law enforcement community, who was a specialized agent with a very special set of skills left his law enforcement career, everything that he knew, his pension, his security, to start a non-profit called Operation Underground Railroad. They've done jumps everywhere throughout the world, rescued kids, and then helped them get to a safe place with their aftercare programs. Tim Ballard, are you here? Can you come on up so we can recognize you and Operation Underground Railroad? (applauding) - I'll be very brief. To invoke history, in 1791 when the Haitian population rose up and destroyed slavery in their country that was led by Toussaint L'Ouverture and then the abolitionists in America were watching. Frederick Douglass was watching and used that inspiration and when slavery was finally eradicated legally, because it has not been eradicated in actuality, Frederick Douglass said, let us not forget the sons and daughters of Haiti who are the true pioneer abolitionists of the 19th century. We'll turn the rest over to God and pray for us all as we take our flights in the 24, 48 hours and execute this operation and I am certain we will have success. Thank you so much. (applauding) Well, I think we should do two arrest teams. I think we should do two arrest teams and pick 'em up as simultaneously as possible. - Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. We're here to discuss preparations for what we are so excited for. It's a day that we've waiting a long time for and we want to thank my colleague, Attorney General Ocnam who is here with his team and then our friends at the DCPG, the Judicial Police for Haiti. Our philosophy is, it doesn't matter what country the kids belong to or were born in, they're all our kids and we want to protect all of them. But sometimes people in our own country ask us, why are you going to Haiti? Why does OUR or why would the Attorney General spend time in another country, we need you here. And our response is, on global crimes like human trafficking, we can't pretend that it just happens in the United States so we work on it here domestically so that we can protect our friends and allies and also protect ourselves so it never comes in to the United States borders. - The U.S. creates the demand. The highest producer and consumer of child pornography is right here in the United States. So we know that it's our countrymen that are causing this. And because we look like those evil countrymen of ours we can get access quickly to the dark, to the evil and so the police ask, do you have operators who can go undercover, into the belly of the beast, into the darkest places and find these kids? And I said, yes we do. Something happened to me once. This is after I'd quit the government and I was already with Operation Underground Railroad and I was about to go into this compound in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. It was a trafficking center. It looked like an orphanage from outside. It had orphanage on the wall. So the police asked us to go in undercover like we're going to go buy kids and I remember sitting outside the gate and I always fight with this, you know. See, the problem with me is I have seven kids so any kid that we're looking to save, the minute I see that kid, oh, he's six, I got a six year old. Oh, he's ten, I got a ten year old. And so it's so easy for my mind just to put, basically, superimpose my kid's face, my child's face, on this victim's face. And I'd fight and I'd fight and I'd fight it. And that's how I would move on because of those first couple of experiences that just almost destroyed me. But as I was standing outside the orphanage something happened, I looked in and I saw 28 kids and that was more than I'd ever seen. And it happened again. Oh my gosh, there's Blaine, there's Jimmy, there's Sam, you know, all my kids are here. And I remember being outside that place and I thought, I'm not going to do it. I'm going to try to embrace this. I've got to buy a kid. These people think we're here to buy kids and they made it very clear within the first five minutes, you know we don't adopt kids, right? You know we sell kids. I'm like, oh, of course yeah! That's why we're here, you know? And I see this little boy walk around from this dark out building. He walks into the yard of this place, this dirty place, it's stinky, it smells like urine and feces and it was just horrible and I went up to this kid and picked him up. (laughing) And he was my kid. I saw my kid and he became my kid. (laughing) So I'm holding him and my partner is negotiating with the bad guys about the price and oh, I think you guys want that one, okay. And these horrible people are trying to, they're telling us tips on how to evade the police and how they've done this before, how to get them out of the country. So I pick the kid up and I want to go into the dark out buildings that are around this compound but I don't want to look like I'm being overly curious. So I'm kind of, I have kids so I know how to communicate with kids so I get him to point in the room as if he's going to show me something and I look over at the bad guys and I can tell they're like, oh, he's wants to show that guy whatever. So it worked, so I got in there and it just got stinkier and darker and as I kind of walked into the belly of this dark building it got quieter and quieter as I got further away from the sounds of the street and the other kids playing outside. And the quieter it got the better I was able to hear what was always there, right behind me. And it was the footsteps of this little child who was following me. And I flip around and there's this little girl. And she's looking at me and I don't want to cause more attention so I give her a candy bar. Now, again, these kids are starving. She takes that candy bar and she looks at me and then looks at the little boy in my arms and without taking her eyes off him breaks it, like muscle memory, breaks it in half and gives it to him. And I'm just thinking, this is not normal. And then it hit me, oh my gosh, they're brother and sister. Say cheese please. And she's horrified because how many westerners have been here and picked up a child and that child disappeared and was never seen again. And this is all she has. The only adults in her life are trying to sell her. How old is she? Nine? You're nine? How long has she been here? Four years. Every 30 seconds a child is sold. They're sold for sex. They're sold for labor. They're sold for organ harvesting, which is something we're now getting into. There's six million children that are forced into one of those three categories right now. (police sirens blaring) (speaking in a foreign language) (police sirens blaring) Modern day slavery really is the plague of our generation. I mean, when you consider there's more people enslaved today than ever before in the history of the world and the world doesn't know. We need to wake them up. (police radio chatter) (police sirens blaring) - [Man] What's up guys? - [Unseen Man] Make sure you handle the victory. (speaking in a foreign language) - [Undercover Agent] He said, if there's one girl that talks back, we call him. (speaking in a foreign language) - [Unseen Man] What the fuck is this?! (intense music) - It's a subject that nobody wants to think about or talk about, that's part of the problem, right? It's so ugly, it's so, it's the worst part of humanity and yet you've got to do something about it. It's kind of a Catch-22, nobody wants to talk about it, nobody wants to happen, nobody wants to talk about it, nobody wants to do anything about it. - Everybody, it just drives me crazy how everybody is arguing on they would be the biggest abolitionist going back in time. Well, would you? Cause you're not doing it now. And it's not that you wouldn't, you just won't look at it. - 'Cause I imagine a lot of people like, oh yeah, that's good. Man, that's awesome work they're doing but they really, sit down man! Like sit down, sit still for 10 minutes. You know. - Yeah, yeah. - And really look at it. If you did that. - It rocked me to my core to think about in this day and age people, adults and children are being held against their will and sold by the hour to strangers to get raped. And this is their life. - People ask me like, who are these dirt bags?! Who are these people. And I have to tell them it's anybody. Anyone you can imagine, anyone you see on the streets, it's professionals, it's doctors, lawyers. - Judgment day for former MSU doctor Larry Nassar for sexually abusing gymnasts under his care. - You are a doctor. You took an oath to do no harm and you have harmed over 256 women and that is beyond comprehension. - [Reporter] The judge also said Nassar was able to get away with his criminal sexual conduct for 25 years. - Here's the thing that's mind boggling, right? Is that it's estimated that there's over two million children, I'm not even talking about the adults, two million children currently forced to be sex slaves. Raped for money. Two million. What kind of demand, and this is a scary question, what kind of demand justifies that number? Two million kids. That's a lot of sick, twisted, pedophiles. - [Reporter] Jared Fogle arrived here at the Federal Courthouse this morning. He had nothing to say. He is pleading guilty to conspiracy for receiving and distributing child pornography and also traveling out of state to engage in commercial sex acts with minors. - These guys want 10 year olds! 11 year olds! That's who that want. The answer to this question is not popular. People don't want me to say it. They don't want me to talk about it. But what is happening in this country, especially in the this country! The United States is the highest consumer of child pornography or what I call child rape videos, 'cause that's what they are. And it's the western world-- - Sheriff's office! We got a search warrant! - The highest consumers, it's us. (knocking) - Let me get my pants. - And this is why, they're sex addicts. Their minds are twisted and sick to want this. I've interrogated dozens and dozens and dozens of these guys over the last 16 years that I've working in this field. No one wants to accept what it is. They don't want to believe it. How did you get here. Why do you want this? Why do you want kids? And they all have the same story. I picked up a Playboy Magazine when I was 12 years old. Then I got into more hardcore and then more hardcore and then the internet came along in my thirties and oh my gosh! Like, I could just, with the click of a mouse I could see anything I wanted. And then the stuff that I had enjoyed since I was a teenager started to wear off. I wasn't getting the fix. I wasn't getting the feeling that I used to get when I was just watching an adult man and an adult woman have sex. Barely legal. That's what they start searching into the queue. To the Google stream. Well, that's not doing it for me anymore. Okay, 16, I'm going to stop there. I'm going to stop at 16, see what happens. All of the sudden they're at 10. They're at nine. They're at eight. They're at seven. And you think you can find this stuff online? Absolutely. And that's what's creating this demand. That's why John's get on a an airplane and fly to Haiti and Columbia and Thailand because pretty soon the child porn isn't doing it for them. And they need the child. This is why there's two million children forced into the commercial sex trade today. - People weren't talking about human trafficking like they are now. And really it's because of the work and efforts by organizations like Operation Underground Railroad. He will never talk about himself but Tim is a well respected author, lecturer, professor, and he could have a quiet life doing that, kind of like Indiana Jones. (laughing) But he has another side to him and that's his law enforcement career. He's was a respected law enforcement agent for many years and because his heart is so big and he's so compassionate and wants to protect every child and man and woman that he possibly can in the world, he left the comfort of his badge and his pension and his way of life in law enforcement to several years ago step out with a lot of faith to create Operation Underground Railroad. At the time he and Katherine did it they had no promise that anybody was going to care. - He'll just jump on a plane and traipse into a country and say, here I am, where can I go save somebody? There are so many things that have to be considered. You're shedding your badge. You're shedding your firearm. You're shedding your authority. You're shedding all the jurisdictional limitations that prohibit me from doing that very thing. But Tim had the courage to do that. - I think there's something to say about Tim's persistence, I guess is the word I would use for him. He wants to be a consistent influence in your life and he's dedicated and I noticed the same thing as he got into government work. That he wanted to get in and make a difference and shake things things up and you could tell he wanted to get in there and make something happen. - I grew up in Southern California. I always knew that I wanted to be a federal agent. I just wanted to do that, I don't know why, it was just like, inherent. My family wasn't excited about it, my parents thought it was crazy. No one in our family had been military or, even generations back, in law enforcement. It was just something that I just wanted to do. So I pursued it, everything I studied, I studied Political Science, I studied International Relations. My first job after Graduate School was the CIA and I worked in the Operations Center. My study had been around terrorism and weapons. I graduated from Graduate School in December of 2001, so the government was wide open for terrorist experts and that's what I wanted to do. And as I was learning about what happened at 9/11 I learned that one of the terrorists had come from Mexicali, Mexico and came through the port of entry into California and then he went back east and then launch these attacks. And I wanted to get on a border. I spoke Spanish, I thought, I want to help investigate and defend against potential terrorists that would hurt our country. I got to the office in Calexico, California, I had my dream job. I mean, I was sitting on the border. My office was on the border. I could see the Mexican flag waving outside my window. This was the time when we were finding a bunch of tunnels through San Diego and all the way through the border on California. I was crawling through tunnels and we were, it was great but it only lasted for about six months. I was called in by my boss and he told me that we're starting a new anti-child trafficking group. - We knew that bad people were transmitting and receiving, exploitive information. Very, very dangerous information and they were violating children. Literally, real time. And exchanging those imagery's and videos on cameras with their cohorts around the world. Realized how absolutely pervasive the problem of child exploitation was. - [Tim] Can you say hi to these guys? Say hi! Hey buddy! Awe, sweet. - A supervisor contacted him and said, hey, we're thinking about starting a child crimes group and want you to do it. He came home and told me about it and we were both like, there is no way that we will ever do that. We had two little kids at the time. It just sounds so horrific. We didn't think that that was something we wanted to bring into our home. My husband has just this light. He's able to see good in the world, you know? And he has a lot of optimism, a lot of strength, I didn't want to see that taken away. We are raising a young family, I didn't want to see that gone and so we took it very seriously. - My wife and I had vowed that the one thing I wouldn't do was child crimes. So we said, no. And I remember going home that night to my wife and saying, you won't believe what they just asked me to do! And she said, well you're not doing it. I said, I'm not doing it, absolutely not. And she said, we have kids, you can't do it! And I remember a sleepless night that night and then getting up the next morning and kind of looking at myself in the mirror, practicing my rejection talk, and as I was preparing my speech my wife came up to me. Emotional, tears in her eyes. And she said, we're making a huge mistake. She said, for the very reason I thought we couldn't do this, or shouldn't do this, is the reason we need to do this. Because we have kids. Because we know what childhood is supposed to be and if it's true that there's millions of kids that are forced into that hell, how do we say no? Because we're afraid of our own pain, which is nothing relative to that pain. - But I told him that I had automatic veto power. That if I ever saw anything in him, that I didn't, just the dimming of the lights or anything that I got to automatically pull the plug, no questions asked, and he would leave that group. - So I reluctantly went, changed my speech and it was just one word, yes. And we got into it. And then something happened that was completely transformative for me. We were doing these child pornography investigations and one of the kids from the video surfaced, and happened to surface right on the border where I was working. - Not long ago a horrific video of a five year old boy being sexually abused in the worst way was discovered by U.S. Authorities. The boy and his 12 year old sister. They had been kidnapped and they had been trafficked back and forth between the U.S. and Mexico. Both were sex slaves to a monster of a man. Well, something happened. Divine providence stepped in and it took place at the U.S., Mexico border. The boy was seen by a U.S. official who knew who he was. Identified the boy in the video. - It was the first time that I was actually seeing one of the kids from the videos. It was an American man who lived in the L.A. area. He had a big warehouse and inside his warehouse was a house, like a residential home and inside that home there were cameras, hidden cameras everywhere, porn everywhere, toys everywhere. And he'd bring these kids in to desensitize them he'd make child rape videos. (sad solemn music) And as the dust settled in the investigation this kid ran to me and I remember he jumped into my arms and just held me and he was shaking and he just said to me, with tears in his eyes, holding me and shaking, he said, I don't belong here. I came home and I walked through the door and I saw my kids running around playing and I couldn't handle the dichotomy. My brain couldn't handle it and I just shut down. I mean, this is embarrassing but this is what happened. I remember my knees gave out. As I sat there the room was spinning and I collapsed, like I fell down on the floor and my wife thought I was having a heart attack or something you know, and she ran over to me and just wrapped her arms around me and just held me. - Had a knock on my door one day and of course I usually keep my door open but I think I was on a phone call so I didn't answer the door immediately but I went to the door and I saw Tim leaving and I asked him, hey Tim, I'm done, come on in. He was very, very concerned. I could tell he was perplexed. I could tell his was emotionally drained. I could tell that he was needing someone to talk to. And he said, listen I really feel like I could do better leaving the government. - Well, if you lost one of your children to one of these evil people you'd do anything to get even and get your child back. Which some of our folks are trying to do. - Good afternoon Mr. Chair and esteemed members of the committee. Thank you very much for this opportunity. My name is Tim Ballard. I'm the founder and CEO of Operation Underground Railroad. - You know, I think our own law enforcement in this country needs to get more involved than they are right now. - In 2006, with the passage of the Adam Walsh Protect Act, Congress opened the doors for U.S. agents to better investigate these cases, especially internationally. - It's hard because a lot of this is offshore where they may not have jurisdiction. - However I often felt helpless by the fact that the vast majority of the child victim's that we would find fell outside the purview of the United States. - It's very difficult because we in the United States have a lot of protections for privacy, especially when it comes to financial transactions, but how do we get the information to see a pattern of sex trafficking? - Before this law was passed, it was passed in 2006, in order to prosecute on the U.S. side an American who was sexually abusing children in other countries you had to prove that that person had intent to rape that child while standing on U.S. soil. So you can imagine how many prosecutions we had prior to this law, like zero. Unless I could tie a U.S. traveler to the case I would not be able to rescue the children, even the ones that we were able to identify as being victims. But I could find the kids no matter what. It's outside of the jurisdiction and I understood that, however that doesn't mean that we couldn't be doing more. - It takes a little bit of an effort but that's what we've go to do and we've got to fight like hell to try and get these kids back and get them back on track. But in a lot of cases once they're gone they're gone. - [Glenn] We need to find some partners that are like minded. Is there a way that, you know, we can help each other? - Yeah. - Cause we're in the same kind of business. You know, who's got big, big, lists that we can leverage me and say, we'll help you, you help us. - [Tim] Have you ever connected-- - I met Tim through, I think, a series of coincidence that led me to one of his books, he's a tremendous writer. Tremendous researcher. I mean, he's really bright. So I knew him as an author and we became friends and I didn't know that he had this secret double life. I was coming in, I don't remember where it was, I was coming into town and he was in town and he said, hey do you mind if we meet and talk? I said, sure. I said, I'm going to be staying at the hotel, you know this hotel why don't you just come up and he said, well, why don't we meet in a conference room? Okay. - I'm wanting the world to wake up to what's going on is two million children are sex slaves. - And he reached under his shirt and he pulled a federal badge out on the chain and he sat there. I looked at everybody and said, am I in trouble? Am I going to prison, what is this? - It's the fastest growing criminal enterprise in the world. I'd go back to 19th century America to the slave problem and we should congratulate ourselves. We eradicated slavery. It's bull crap. We've not eradicated it. - And he explained what he was doing and explained that he needed to get out of working with the government and he had a way that we could really make an impact but they needed a million dollars to start. - [Attorney] 10 thousand dollars to put a jump team together, go, (clapping) on team, get this overseas I'm assuming. - Yeah, we have jump teams that do this. They're ex Navy Seals, they're people like me who are willing to do this. - And I happen to be with an attorney and he was sitting with me and I asked a whole bunch of questions and my attorney said, no you can't, you can't. What happens if something goes wrong, blah, blah, blah. If you're raising money and it's on the border and these guys are, you're in Texas. - You're damn right I would. I would do it through law enforcement and I would do it exactly legal. But, I mean, this is child trafficking. Tim is the most sincere, the most honest honorable man I think I've ever met and I said, I'm in. We'll raise your first million. - Bring it on. I will promote, I will do, I will develop with you. I had a great, great, great uncle and a great, great, grandfather who both died in the notorious concentration camp in the South. They were fighting for the North. I didn't know that. Nobody in my family knew that. They were fighting to free the slaves. They did it. Why can't I? - You know, Abraham Lincoln, when he was grappling with the Emancipation Proclamation the nation didn't want him to do it. Even in the North, they didn't want him to do it. And he went through something. In 1862 his son died. And he got extremely empathetic and he started even turning to God and praying like he never had before. Historians have called it a Damascus Road experience for him. Then he just said, you know, come hell or high water I'm doing this. No one in his cabinet really wanted him to and he says, I'm doing it. And he changed the course of the war and changed the course of history. By making the war about human freedom, liberating the captive and then the whole thing changed which led to the 13th Amendment and so forth. This is what we all need to do. Stop putting the walls up. These are real kids and they don't have anybody and if we don't open up, no one's going to open up. But when you do open up, it hurts a little bit. But then you become so much more effective in what you're trying to do and ideas and inspiration, I'd argue even miracles start happening when you do that. - Operation Underground Railroad is a fairly new organization, just over two years old but it's captured a lot of media attention with it's missions to rescue child slaves throughout the world. India, Haiti, Mexico. They go into the darkest corners of the world. (speaking in a foreign language) And work with law enforcement to rescue children from slavery. Since it's inception a little over two years ago they've helped authorities arrest 157 people in 12 different countries. Most of that work-- - I never dreamed that I would work in Haiti. I didn't know anything, really, about Haiti. Until I learned about a little boy who was born in Utah, a U.S. citizen and was kidnapped in Haiti from his church where his father was the pastor. And that little boy was taken, he was kidnapped. I read about it in the local newspaper and I just had to do something about it. I thought that I could make it into a U.S. case and I couldn't because it wasn't. It was a Haitian case. The man, the father of this boy who I met who changed my world is Guesno Mardy. And Guesno's sitting right here, Guesno just stand up. This is Guesno Mardy. - [Attendee] Hey Guesno. - And I have so much to say about Guesno. We went to Haiti to look for his son but the only way for us to go to Haiti would be to, we had to leave our jobs. I had to leave my job because I didn't have enough leave from work. I love my job. I love working for Homeland Security. I mean, these are the best people on the planet doing the best work. And all the colleagues I had floated this idea to before, in the weeks leading up, said, you're crazy, don't do this, you're crazy. And John Lines looked at me and he started off with, you're crazy. And I'm like, here I go again, you know? But he said something different, he said, you're crazy if you don't try this. - I was encouraging overtly but my in my heart of hearts I thought, that's going to be a tough go. That's a going to be a tough go to leave the security of the U.S. Government and go save children around the world. Three years old. Gardy, his name is Gardy. They kidnapped him from the church where Guesno was the pastor. They took him, this little boy, and they trafficked him and this happens all the time in Haiti. I remember reading the story and there was a picture of Guesno and my heart just melted as a father. Just melted for him and I thought, I know, I have enough experience to know, very little's being done to find this little boy. (solemn music) - We got to Haiti and we worked with law enforcement and we went in there looking for Gardy and we never found him. What we did find was two things. We found that this child was trafficked through what looked to be like an orphanage. It wasn't an orphanage and we were asked by the Haitian Police to go undercover with hidden cameras and go into this place that was selling children. They were selling children for $10,000 and then they raised the price to $15,000. The traffickers were selling kids and we were able to dismantle that organization and we had to buy two children in the process. We had to buy two children and they were the key to getting the other kids out. - What's that? - You want this? (laughing) Be careful with this, okay? After we got those kids out and his son was not there. And I said, Guesno I'm so sorry. You're son's not there. There's 28 children that were rescued but his son was not there. I started to cry and Guesno was crying but he only cried for a little bit and then he popped his head up and he said, don't you realize what just happened? And I said, what? Yeah, you know, what just happened? And he's smiling now and I don't know why he's smiling because he's a very smiley guy and he has a light about him and I learned what that light was because he said, he said, if Gardy had never been kidnapped then your team never would have come here and these 28 kids would be for sale or be sold. And I said, yeah, I guess would have thought of it that way and then he said maybe the most profound thing that anyone's ever said to me. He said, if I have to sacrifice my son so that these 28 kids can be rescued, he said, that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. And that's when I knew that we would never leave Haiti because of the spirit of that Haitian man who then by the way, went to the police station the next day and he said, I will take home any of those children that were rescued in the name of my son, I will take them home. And he took eight of those children home that day and he is their father today in Haiti. And so you see we could never leave Haiti after that. We decided we had to do more operations. We had to dig deeper, look for Gardy. Dig deeper, the more we go looking for Gardy, a funny thing happens, every time we look for him we find other kids. Gardy is the kid who's story created Operation Underground Railroad. You been (beep) little girls too? 10 years old, love this guy! (laughing) I sat across from this guy, these guys, as they told me about the children that had been raping and they laughed about it. And they laughed and they scoffed. And they said, you get to do it next. It was horrifying, horrifying. Now this was on Superbowl Sunday and this is where the story gets very interesting. - On Superbowl Sunday a lot of Americans having those Superbowl parties, hot wings, watching the big game, but a local non-profit organization that fights human trafficking spent their Superbowl weekend in Haiti. - [Tim] I can take the 11 year old? Can I take your youngest? - [Reporter] Timothy Ballard and his team at Operation Underground Railroad worked undercover pretending to purchase young girls for sex. Ballard says the men sold him twenty minors as young as 11 years old. - It was Superbowl Sunday, February 5th, 2017. We had set up this operation that what looked like it went flawless. - In Operation Underground Railroad we always want to ensure that if these rescued children cannot go back to their parents then they go into vetted safe houses, orphanages, rehabilitation centers. So our aftercare team, led by Miss Jessica Mass, who is here with us today spent weeks liaisoning with partners in Haiti. Not just Guesno and his safe house but others who's names cannot be shared now for their own protection. - We'll go into a country and the first question we ask, if the police or that government wants to work with us, the first question we ask is, what kind of aftercare capabilities are you aware of? These kids, there's so many of them. There is no home to go home to. It's not like this happy story all the time where it's like, oh, your loving family's been waiting for you in the garden and the trees are there and the beautiful flowers and just go hug them and all is well. I mean, generally that's not the case. I wish it were but generally the fact that there was no family, or the family was part of the problem, that's how they got trafficked. - And that's where everybody else screws it up. It's where we screwed up. That's the reconstruction part. The ending of the slavery was good. Now, how do we make sure that we provide the tools to be able to make it and to able to have a fair shot at something that you've never experienced before? I can't even imagine the scaring that they have and to able to see them turn their lives around, remarkable. - We laid out the whole operation. You saw from the video the beautiful Kaliko Beach Club. We have to play the role of very wealthy sex tourists and so we had the whole operation set up and it went beautifully. - [Reporter] When police arrived, they arrested nine men from three separate human trafficking rings and liberated 29 victims. - Our Haitian partners did an amazing job. We made the arrests. We got the girls immediately to the area where we were assured that they would get the support they need. - We were so excited, we were excited that these girls were finally going to have hope and healing. It was just a couple days after that I received a phone call. - We unfortunately got some very frustrating news a few days after the operation. - [Jessica] The traffickers were being released and not all the girls were released. - They get released, they get freed. They pay money to the right people. To the judges. I remember when we got that word, I remember Jessica, Matt, we were in tears. We were in tears. We couldn't believe that these kids could be put in harm's way again. - Half the girls had family members that showed up and the other half had traffickers that showed up for them. - These guys who were laughing about raping children were now laughing their way home. (laughing) We didn't know what to do. We had some long talks about it, with Guesno and Dimitri and they just said, please don't give up. Don't give up, there are good people in this government that want this problem to go away. And what happened was what we hoped would happen, the good people who didn't know what happened to us, they came to us. The good people came to us and they said, we didn't know this truth. We didn't know what had happened but we will not stand for it. And I'm looking at the good people right now who came to us. The job's not quite done but it's almost done because now we need to go back and we need to re-arrest every single one of these traffickers and it will be a message to Haiti, to America, to the whole world that there are good people everywhere that will stand up for this. That there is light in this dark world. There's light. If we don't become that light there is no light. (applauding) - [Interpreter] But I do sometimes they try to. (applauding) (rock music) - [Tim] Hey, crap this guys coming up through-- - We finally have our eyes on what's going on, we're shifting our mind set. There's two of them that we have, we still need to verify and we're going to have reconnaissance teams running the rest of the day. It limits what we want to do during the day. We would rather not do a snatch and grab on the side of the street in the middle of the daytime. It's very hard to sneak up to people with the way this traffic is and do that effectively. It's a very low chance. You're talking like 15% chance of actually getting these guys. Just so everything knows, Andrew knows this area we're going to better than anyone, he's lived there for periods of his life so honestly he knows this better than the police that are putting us in it. He knows this area. - In a nutshell, top of the trees perspective, our activities tonight are going to take place in Petion-Ville, which is a wealthier part of Port-au-Prince where there's several hotels. So there's a lot of working, there's a lot of prostitution going on. That where-- For Haiti. And it's the place where foreigners come. If you're a foreigner you're going to come here, you're going to stay most likely in Petion-Ville so that's where to track some of the nefarious activities. - [Dave] So, any questions about the area? We're going to pull up Google Maps, we've dropped pins on everything so everyone's going to get a good visual of the area that we're looking at. - [Dimitri] Okay guys as you're doing this stay to the windows and hold there. I seen lights back there, there shouldn't be lights back there. Okay, we are in an unmarked van. It's a van that is used for taxis. In a few minutes I'm going to have to put my windows down because it's not known to have taxis having their windows up freezing. - [Dave] I understand. In a nutshell, the birds eye view here, is we're going after three different targets, okay? And one of them's a female. This is our ace in the hole mission. If everything else fails we are getting this chick tonight. She's awful, Andrew can go into more detail. - [Dimitri] Okay, she's like a captain, a captain in a mafia. - Our hotel's right here, Best Western, Petion-Ville, all right? She's literally like two blocks away and one down, typically. But she kind of moves within like, I would say a one block radius of that spot. - [Dimitri] She's crossing the street. She's crossing the street. That's her right there. Crossing the street with the white pants. That's her right there. That's her right there. That's the boss right there. - [Andrew] She does not like this. - [Dimitri] That's the boss right there. - All those girls are working for her. She's their pimp and show that she is number one. - Number one. - She pimps out young girls and she keeps, she has the over, the legal girls on the street. She has a little house back there where one of our operators has seen underage girls. - We're now moving. - [Andrew] Did you see how long that car has been behind us? - He just got behind us. - Has he just came behind us? - [Andrew] Just keep, pay attention to it. It's possible we have a tail behind us. - [Dimitri] Oh, okay. - [Andrew] They turned right, it's turning off. - [Dimitri] So she didn't see us. - If there's any like holes in the logic right now. Anything glaring that anyone's thinking about. This is like time to beat it to death because there's gonna, this is all coming together very quick and guarantee there's more things. - You know what I want to do is start with a prayer. What about, what about your special prayer? - You want me to pray that prayer? - Yeah, I kind of do, yeah. - All right, we'll just like bow our heads and I'll sing it real quick. (speaking in a foreign language) May Jehovah bless you and keep you. May Jehovah let his face shine upon you and be gracious to you. May Jehovah lift up his countenance upon you and give you shalom, amen. - [Everyone] Amen. (rhythmic drum music) Okay, this is the part that nobody really wants to talk about or do but it's the part we probably need to know the best. Somebody gets shot or stabbed or severely injured enough they have to be taken to a higher level of care. We've got a number of these kids that are going to be spread out in the vehicles. These are called blow out kits. Emergency? Okay, so then none of this stuff is going to matter to you, however if that time and somebody gets hurt and if somebody yells medic everything else needs to stop. Nothing else matters because we could lose a person at that point, right? So, the Haitians are going to do whatever they're going to do but this group in here, we're going to keep that person alive. - So our target's name is Cho and she's a pimp who's going to be on a street corner about two or three blocks from here. We intend to take Cho and try and get, if we can, use her to get information. We've got eight other targets that are out there that were stupidly released. We know that she paid $80,000 to someone to get out of jail. We really want to understand where she got $80,000 from. We believe a criminal organization supports her. We've been to her house, she's not living large at all. So she's back by so and so, we want to find out who pays you the 80,000 and who within the government did you give that 80,000 to? In addition, we want to just scare the living daylights out of her and use the momentum and fear, just listen, the next five minutes of your life are going to determine the next 50 years of your life. This is our plan, once the Haitians come-- - It's their country, of course. - Right. - We do what they want. - Perimeter one and perimeter two, as long as we got eyes looking out board with guns while we're in the middle, that's the only goal here. We're making these things really simple. Look, we don't all rush to the middle of the action here, you know? And that's what rookies do. That's what idiots do. They have a job and even if they don't like their job, even if it's not the cool job, this is their damn job. - I think it goes without saying, we don't want them to know where we're staying tonight at all and if we need to take different routes or just be really familiar with who's behind you and who could be following you. Even if it's a little motorcycle, those guys are the worst. Motorcycle guys are bad. And they're going to be the informants. So we want to sleep safely and those driving to the airport tomorrow, we don't want any issues. - Hey guys. - Hey Jim. - Of the guys down stairs there's-- - Perfect. The recon one, we're like three minutes to deploy. (radio chatter) (inspirational music) (traffic sounds) (motorcycle engines) (speaking in a foreign language) - [Andrew] All right you guys, up there where the lights are, where the lights are is about where she's at. It's this car, it's this car pulled over, okay? (speaking in a foreign language) - Are we close man? - It's right here you guys. - [Andrew] Right here, right here. (speaking in a foreign language) - [Agent] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go! (speaking in a foreign language) (motorcycle engine) (speaking in a foreign language) - [Agent] Condoms, these are all from a huge bag of condoms. - [Agent] We need to bag all this evidence. There's minors on scene and he's got condoms. He's got sex toys, he's got condoms in there. (speaking in a foreign language) - I'm a citizen of U.S.A.! - [Agent] Matt, take a photo of them. - Yo, I'm a citizen of U.S.A., okay! I'm a citizen of U.S.A.! - [Agent] Everyone, safe vehicles! - [Agent] All right, roll out! Safe vehicles! - [Tim] How many guys got wrapped up right there? - Two or four. - There was the American. - He's saying he's an American, yeah. - [Agent] I thought he was saying-- - I don't think he was-- - Americans. - No, no, no, he was saying, I'm an American. So we got more than we bargained for on that one for sure. Hey, where are we, are we at the precinct? (speaking in a foreign language) - This is very important. I know he said it but these guys are confirming again, those were the girls, the same girls, that she brought, same girls? - Hm mm. - And we think that they live with her. She keeps them captive in her own home. - I'd like to talk to somebody! So can I talk to somebody out there! I'm a citizen of United States! Yes! So can I talk to somebody who can explain what's going on!? I'm a citizen of United States. - [Tim] Oh yes. In Kaliko Bay. And the girls, same girls she brought to Kaliko. Their minors, tell him. Their 13, their 13, 12, 13, 14, years old. You caught her red handed. (speaking in a foreign language) (light music) - Thank you. (soothing music) (speaking in a foreign language) - We get the kids out. Before the kids are pulled out of these dens of nightmares and their in our safe house. Jessica Mass, our director of aftercare's with them and they start to open up, they start to talk. And the one little girl, the youngest of them, starts to cry, starts to tear up and she said, this is the first time that I've ever felt hope that I can remember. And she proceeded to tell us this story about how when she was about six or seven years old she was kidnapped in the wake of the earthquake. (police sirens) Her parents were killed in the earthquake, like so many parents were, and she was left an orphan instantly and this nice woman comes up, tells her that she'll take care of her and to come with her. This was happening all over in the wake of the earthquake. In the case of Rosy, I mean, she was six, seven years old, Cho gets ahold of her, promises to take care of her and instead puts her into a life of sex slavery. And this was so crazy, she said it's amazing that you guys came and rescued me on January 12th. She said, it was January 12th, eight years ago, when the earthquake struck. Hey! How are you? This little girl was in the most obscure country in the world. Not only that she was in the most obscure and darkest corner of that most obscure country just wallowing in hell, far from anyone possibly could care. You're so big. (speaking in a foreign language) It took her 24 hours after the rescue to even talk because she said she couldn't believe that anyone would come for her. Santa Claus? Who's that? - Santa Claus. He came? It's what we are trying to do. We intentionally go to the darkest corners of the Earth where there is no hope and find these kids. And what that does, apart from liberating children, what that does is it provides hope for everybody now. I mean, where there was no hope there's hope everywhere. If we can continue to grow our operations and continue to get the support we need there is hope everywhere for the first time. Okay, scoot over, we got to have a talk. We got to have a talk right here. Okay, what's your name? Hey? - You got to talk to papa. - Hey, hey, what's your name? What's your name, not yet, not yet. What's your name? Coleen. (gasp) - Jean-Baptist Catel. Yeah! What's your name buddy. (inspirational music) We find these two things. We found the traffickers were selling kids and we were able to dismantle that organization and we had to buy two children in the process. We had to buy two children. And they were the key to getting the other kids out. And we've told that story many times but what's special about those two children is that I formed a special bond with them. And when we were driving from the orphanage to the sting house, or the hotel, this little boy jumped up into my lap and I'm supposed to be this, you know, hard criminal. After the rescue was done we, my wife and I couldn't stop thinking about them, him and his sister, they were the two kids and so we started to work towards adopting them. That was almost four years ago and I just got the email today. The decree came out of Parke and their names are now Ballard. They're now, they're my children. If I lived in Haiti. (applauding) If I lived in Haiti I could take them home right now so all we have to wait for now is passports and visas and that and then they come home to Utah. Where's Cole and Coleen going to sleep? We have one extra bedroom, right? - Yeah, but where's Daniel going to sleep? - He's going to bunk with the boys. - Everything with me. - With Rick. - There are days that Tim and I are like, what, why do we have all these kids? But, but, I just, you look at this little guy and he is so loved and just by virtue of the fact that he was born in a family and that automatically gives him access to this love. That we don't even have to think about, it's just there. And there are so many children around the world that don't have that and that could. There just shouldn't be this much excess with that many children in need. (soft slow piano music) - I'll find him. It is something I don't want to talk about because I know I will find him. I will find him. One day something will happen, I'll find him. - Number one thing on my bucket list, what I want to do is I want to help stop human trafficking. - Oh, that's beautiful. (applauding) - I belong to an organization called Operation Underground Railroad. There are over two million children who are stolen and they are abused sexually and it's unbelievable what happens. And I belong to that organization and we are trying to stop that. It's really-- - What do you do? - A man called Tim Ballard, and he used to work for the F.B.I. but he's now gone on his own. So he partners with governments from other countries and they go in and pretend to be traffickers so they get people to get people to bring kids in and they pretend to buy those kids. And then they catch the people who are bringing the kids in. - How much does it cost them to free a child? - Anywhere probably from 12,000 to 50,000 an operation. - I'll give you 100,000 if you'll get me 10 children out of slavery. - Awesome! Thank you! (audience cheers and applauds) - Tony, when you did that, $100,000, that just rocked me. I was raised in a Catholic orphanage from the time I was seven till I was 19 but out of our savings I can't match you but I'd like to give $10,000 with your gift. - [Tony] Awesome, that's incredible.
