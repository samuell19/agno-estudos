The Serious Game Subtitles by Nostromo Lydia! Once together with me the priest shall ask you if you want to be my chosen friend Bravo,dear dad! What are you going to call it,"Pine in the sun"? Routine!I suggest "Sun over pines"! -But that, ah Filip,don't joke with Dad! Edvard Bergh discovered the Swedish birch grove Dad discovered the archipelago pine. Well done Painting it is not an art either, I'm painting as well as I did 40 years ago But selling it,that's art! It takes time to learn You're a great artist, dear dad! Freutiger is coming here tonight. Then we'll sing together! -Baron Freutiger alone? -Yes,that would be a nice quartet Oh, no, clerk Lovén and candidate Stjärnblom are also coming. Lovén, that loudmouth? Then please let me disappear I would like to see that A tenor who can shut up when he hears others sing I've never heard of anything like that! You can sing according to your style Yes, yes, but there will be not much of a banquet Perch, smoked ham, herring and potatoes, that's all there is Vodka and punch, beer and brandy. What more is needed, all glorious gifts of God! -Good day, everyone! -Good day Miss Lydia ... Welcome Do you have any brandy, little thief? We have whiskey That's fine. Then we'll drink the whiskey and save the brandy The moon, he shines, the water glitters calmly and cold The lilac, jasmines spread the scent all over The butterfly in gold and green glimmers on the flower beautifully The worm soon crawls out of its gravel The worm soon crawls out of its gravel It must be wonderful to have such a beautiful voice as that of the clerk! The born King of the songs No, now I must go in and make sure we get something to eat Yes,please do that nice, good, and beautiful sweet Miss Lydia! Are you going to have an exhibition this autumn? For what purpose? One can't,damn me,learn all modern dirty tricks,I'm too old. Cheers! -Cheers -Cheers Too old! When it comes to toasting all nights and boozing like a trooper then they are not too old! Thank God for that Augusta We have seen the bottom of the world's swindle! Lovén,he can only look upwards because he is a tenor. Stjärnblom, he is young. Young people only see themselves Consider us older as pure staffage in the painting. -Isn't it so, Arvid? -Cheers -Cheers -Cheers -Lydia? -Meow What do you think about it that? -You and Lydia? To be married? -Sure, why not? None of your cheek,you old swine! Cheers! Just that you would be in Stockholm this winter and that we might see and meet each other occasionally! That's just enough for me -Do you start at the Nationalbladet? -Yes It's one of my fifty-eleven cousins ​​who has picked me His name is Markel, he is deputy head of the editorial office I can just do that,like something else You have to do something while you wait. Waiting for what? I don't know Maybe for nothing at all. That I could do something that works out Your future The future, yes. What do we know about it? Do you think Do you think that you and I could create us a small world for ourselves? We must try. The table is served on the verandah. At last, a piece of food should really taste deliciously on the verandah Yes, I promise Singer! Here's the first! I believe in you. I believe in you. and I can wait! ... he only thinks of parting Good night, my dear! Good night, my dear my dear love! -Did you propose? -When could I have the possibility? -But she probably understood me. -Sure! Your song was symbolic. What do you mean? I'm just thinking about your false notes. Well yes, we are both young and we can wait. I couldn't stand the thought of someone waiting for me. Take it easy, you will probably be the one waiting One is expecting something from me If I have that thought all the time, then nothing will become of me But it's Roslin! Lydia, Lydia, have you seen what a nice traveling companion we got! May I say it was a pleasant surprise! Does Miss Lydia recognize me? Well,wouldn't I remember Dr. Roslin? Well, there's a few years ago. Miss Lydia has become the great lady! The grand beautiful lady -Miss Stille,my sister Esther. -Good day So you're done with sail ship paintings?Had enough time for it Yes, now I'll go in and sell them You might need a couple of pines to freshen up your castle walls? Yes, I could Yes, why should my gallery be worse than the National Museum? Or the Luxembourg gallery But you know I have a painting in the Luxembourg gallery Well, I've heard that. Yes, we'll see It would be nice also to revive our old friendship. Dr Doncker Chief Editor -Is Dr. Markel still here? -Yeah,he is Do you have the duty tonight? Yes, I have, but now I'm going to go and get a piece of food. Good afternoon Good afternoon You can say what you like, but meatballs and brown beans In any case, surpass all the delicacies of the Orient. Or what do you think? Of course funny talk What did you say? Whom did you greet? A girl I met in the archipelago this summer A family girl? Sure, a family girl Damn you,beware of that! Such acquaintances are very good during summer but if you continue with them, you can get caught before you know it. No,I'll probably will be beware of that But maybe you can go ahead and marry her? On my income as a proof reader and journalist volunteer? No, dear Markel, I don't think so Honors to your judgment,thank you Before we hacks reach the time we can defend bringing children into the world With any luck we'll be so old and ill-equipped that we can no longer defend it. And seduce her? Well, it has its risks If you succeed, you will lose all respect for her and if you fail then you'll lose all respect, which you perhaps had for yourself. -You don't know the girl -No,if I did that Then maybe I would have a completely different view of the matter Lydia! Some short summer days of sun and happiness And now the autumn has arrived So, Mr. Stjärnblom whistling Pathétique? Whoops! I apologize Well, by all means But it fits perfectly. Then you will go to the Opera and review tonight! -Shall I? -Yes It's a little girl who will make her debut as Margareta in Faust. But our regular music reviewer has become ill I usually substitute for him myself, but I'm going to dinner Goodbye, goodbye! Though my heart is stabbed deeply Though my heart is stabbed deeply Girl - watch out! Remember, with ring on the finger first you should kiss! Remember with ring on the finger first you should kiss first you kiss should! Yes, that sounds good,generally The girls probably know best themselves in what order it should come isn't it like that,Miss Stille? Hope so. You get so much expert advice these days. There you got it! Lydia doesn't need any advice Thank you for the trust, dear Dad. No, now I have to leave. Are you staying long? No,I'll stay for a while and then I will come home Yes, but this is good! "Miss Klarholm's voice and singing talent points to almost unlimited possibilities." "Her acting, however, indicates a lack of instruction." "Margareta will only go insane in the prison scene" "but Miss Klarholm played insane almost from the beginning" "This Margareta seemed born insane." That was not bad! People don't like to hear too much praise about others. However,the one who receives the praise thinks it is never enough and the others become jealous. But if a critic scolds a commander or a singer then ONE will be sad and all the others will be happy. So just go on scolding,you should try to spread some joy among humanity! Thanks Good evening! -Yes, yes, old Stille is dead. -What are you saying? What is it? How can it affect you in any way? I knew him a bit. Yes, he was old and we are all going to die Almost everyone As Louis XIV's court preacher added when he saw that the king's face went gloomy I've not heard at all that he has been ill No, he hasn't been either, it was a tram accident. How did it happen? He had been binging with some happy blokes And then he would take the tram home did not think he was more than sixty years old He tried to jump on the trailer,well then he fell and hit his head on the street. Here is the obituary from the Nordic Family Book. Can you be kind enough and take it because you knew him You could probably write to something that is a little more personally tinged I'm going down and look at the printer's error Excuse me,where's the advertising and announcement department? Please, it's up there. I was going to ask to publish a small notice Thank you for everything beautiful that was written about dad -But I couldn't find the way. -I can show the way. Thanks But why such a hurry? Don't you want to sit with me for a while? Yes, if it is possible Aren't you going to take off your hat? If it is suitable? Someone might come that will look awkward No one is coming. Is this where you sit and write? Sometimes Most of the time I sit in the large editorial room along with fifty other poor hacks But if someone wants you for something? You take it very easy You can take it easy It is not that much respected in this editorial office but one thing is respected unconditionally, a closed door. What are you going to do now when your dad is dead? I'll try to find a place. Yes, I have to work. Dad did not leave much behind. Thank you for sending the wreath -What are you're going to work with? -With anything If the Lady in the house wants to shop I don't have any special abilities. Domestic work is the only thing I can do. Do you remember when we saw each other at the restaurant? You were in the company of a gentleman. That was Doctor Roslin. Markus Roslin, the cultural historian and archaeologist? -Yes An old friend of Dad. He has an estate in Sörmland called Stjärnvik. I have to tell you something. The next day I felt a completely irresistible longing to talk with you. So I went up to the house where you live and rang the doorbell Lo and behold. But you only rang once. I couldn't imagine that it was you. I don't like to ring more than once. I also respect a closed door. Lydia May I ask you a question? Yes You must promise me not to get angry with me No Are you..? Are you ... an innocent girl? Yes, you witnessed that Are you angry at me for asking? No Do you know what I was thinking when you didn't open? I thought like this "Then I have nothing to save myself for." -Yes but .. -That's it Lydia I can't think of marriage ... other than as in a distant future, you have to understand that. Yes But if you wanted to be my secret lover... No, I don't want to be a burden for you. Everything else, but not a burden for you I must go now. -Am I not allowed to see you some time? -I don't know I want to whisper something in your ear I want to, but I don't dare. "I want out .and so far, far away" Lydia(In Norwegian) -Damned! -What then? Look for yourself! Engaged What do you think of that? That girl is not content with trifles! Markus Roslin! At least 600000! -600 000? -Not a penny less. And can you imagine She's the only girl I've ever loved. Seriously, you see! Two weeks after old Stille's death I wrote to her and proposed Honestly,correct As I believe with exact information about my fortune, a little over 200000 crowns I got an answer immediately. Signed "Respectfully" Then you can roughly imagine the content! - "I want out" -What did you say? Nothing. Well, then of course I thought she found me too old Forty-six years and she nineteen. I must admire her steadfastness in the prospect of being well supported But Roslin is over fifty, so it was not the age that was wrong with me That was not the cause Dear Freutiger you don't think seriously that the difference in wealth was the decisive factor for her? Yeah,what the hell are you else going to think? You must have money for living But a little more or less, she has probably not thought of that No,perhaps not I guess she just thought Roslin was a little more in shape than I was. And then she can expect to become a widow a few years earlier with him than with me We should hope that she soon finish him off, he is a frail weakling That she would be in love with him is out of the question. Would you like to have dinner with me? -Thank you but I probably can't. -We'll eat well, drink like hell! Thanks,thanks I have to go to the newspaper. No,but Markus Do you like it? Like it? It's wonderful! It's more than that, it's a relic. A relic? Tell me! I bought it thirty years ago for a woman I loved. But she betrayed me before she got it. Then I promised myself that no one else would wear it Than the woman who would mean more to me than anything else in the world And that woman ... That woman is you. -If you let me down ... -No Markus We have just returned home from our honeymoon -You're young, I'm old. -But we will share my youth Then I will share your old age. If you let me down, you'll never wear that ring again, you promise me. I promise! But then you must also promise me something. Yes Taste this omelet before it gets cold I just got it ready Yes, that's fine,I'll have a look! Thanks Will you come and have dinner with the builder Randels? -Absolutely not -Why not? You've given me a reason, I'm not invited. It doesn't matter I have some cards here that I have had to hand out among desirable persons So just put the name in there. Come on, never hurts to show up,I'll tell you I must admit that Randels doesn't exactly belong to the highest society. Yes,then welcome ! The Director and Mrs Jacob Randel have the honor to invite Mr Editor Arvid Stjärnblom to dinner 13th October at 6 pm Nice delicious study,isn't it? Refined And so similar ... so natural, I mean. Extremely natural I got it in Paris. The French they know! 6000 francs! A nice sum of money! But it's worth it,isn't it? I don't know if it is,you can get a real alive much cheaper. How can Mr Markel know that? I know someone who has tried. Dagmar! Dagmar! Is no one inviting you to dance? No! But I was just going to invite Mr. Stjärnblom! I dare not even dream of such an honor! Gallop! It was strenuous! You start getting old. Yes, we all do Isn't it fun to be with the grown ups and play too? -I will be 26 years old on the 20th -Yes, it's awful. What should I say when I turn 28 on the exact same day! But really, do we have the same birthday? Yes, that was funny! -Do you want something to drink? -Thank you,with pleasure Well,there we have the conqueror Yes,I saw her just when the girl came here with her Damned you! Beware! Randel has an atrocious business. You've already told me that -It's nothing I want at all -You don't realize it This rose costs two crowns this season,at least! The girl wants to get married. Look, Markel, you don't want to imagine me that I,with my small salary would be a favorable match in her eyes? No, it's she who imagines that her father is rich and that she is a favorable party. -And she wants to get married! -But not I. What does it help You don't choose your destiny not your wife,your mistress and your children. You get them, and you have them. You may lose them. But you don't choose. -Good day,Mr. Stjärnblom -Good day, Miss Randel. -The letter was to you. -To me? Just a small thank you for the beautiful flower. I feel unworthy and broken-hearted I had not sent you any flowers! No, why would you do that? It is neither in the Bible nor in the Catechism That you shall send flowers for birthdays You only do it when you feel like it And so I got the urge -Where are you going? -Yes, I was going to have dinner. -Are you very hungry? -No Do you not feel like taking a short walk then? I was just going to suggest it You understand that I can't think of getting married at all? No, that's something I've not be thinking about I understand quite well that you don't want to get married. Almost all marriages become unhappy nowadays Is it your stepmother you're lamenting? No, Dad's probably fine. That's fine But Arvid when you don't want to get married is it just because you can't afford it? I never said I did not want to, I've said I can't. -Yes but -But what? Dad has said that if I get married then he will contribute to the household. My dear, I don't want to be financially dependent on your father. But dependent, Arvid.. So far, I've been able to sort myself out somewhat. It's evident you'll sort it out yourself Tomorrow I have to go straight to my father and mother out to the countryside again. Who knows when I may be able to travel into town next time In a way suits us both Doncker and I have just agreed that I will do the continent this summer. Do the continent? Travel about a few weeks watch some cultural events, do some great interviews And music? Mm, everything possible, you have to try staying all-round. Who knows, in a few years I may be the foreign editor of Nationalbladet -And still music reviewer? -Mm Then with double pay? But Markus why don't you want a child? Because I'm a genius! Yes, it is said between us And don't spread it But I'm a genius and children of geniuses often become idiots. That's why I don't want children. But it is possible that the child would take after me And I'm not a genius. Of course you are, a diplomatic genius. But you are first and foremost my wife. I'm a woman! I would like to have a small child. It's probably not part of his program No, he bought me as his legal mistress! But Lydia? Don't think about that. Now you are going to travel Travel? And look at the latest harvest of Greek vases and ancient broken statues! Dagmar! What is that? What is it? Dagmar What is it,little child? -Has something happened? -Yes Just don't My stepmother had heard some talk about us and so she gossiped to my dad. It was not malicious,she is not mean but she lives in gossip. Dad became terribly angry and interrogated me. Of course,first I thought of denying everything but then I was ashamed and you know I couldn't And when I said .. Yes,what did you say? That we were secretly engaged. But what did you want me to say? Well,no No, you couldn’t say otherwise. Well, what did your father say? At first he called me a slut and enjoyed the pleasure But then he calmed down But then he said that he stood by the two thousand if it came to marriage He said nothing bad about you. Is it really that impossible for you to get married? It seems to me rather impossible. Don't cry,dear! Don't cry We must try to do the impossible Arvid Welcome, Mr. Stjärnblom! Yes, little Dagmar has prepared us for your visit. And that's probably how "La belle Hélène" sings: "We must have love, but never too small" My husband is waiting for you inside his room please this way Jakob! -Welcome, Mr. Stjärnblom! -Thanks Yes, my daughter has told me how it is ... Does Mr. Stjärnblom want to drink a glass of punch? Thanks Please Well, the newspaper business is not as bad these days as it used to be before No, by all means, you can drag yourself forward. The youth must not have too great pretensions. But to begin with, we can drop the titles. You can say uncle. Cheers Cheers, uncle Yes, your newspaper is going forward! Yes,probably. I met Dr. Doncker at a dinner the other day. He wanted me to buy some shares in the newspaper. Well,now I'll enter into a form of clash of duties As an employee of the newspaper,I should, of course,advise my uncle to buy shares but as my uncle's possible son-in-law, I must advise against it Well,it doesn't matter I have nothing to buy for These are bad times. Well, have the gentlemen come to any result? Food is served! Ask Dagmar to come here. Yes,my little girl,now you'll get the man you wanted. And above all, I want to put to your hearts a small verse from the old book of Psalms "Thou shalt not commit adultery, as that would be a great torment." But Dad ! Yes,that's really true is, I know it from my own experience Now we'll go and have a schnapps and a sandwich, come on! Married Arvid Stjärnblom and Dagmar Randel -Ester -Yes? Who's coming to dinner today? The old ordinary. Stångbergs. Wulfcronas, Gaddes, and Lundgrens from Sjötorp. Mrs. Lundgren has had a couple of cousins ​​visiting so there is always a bit of variety. And Captain Linde at Berga? Yes, of course, what else would the girls say? My husband travels tomorrow to the Archaeological Congress in Amsterdam. Lydia Lay down Now you must sleep There you go Good night, sleep well Well,now,how do you think I look like? Nice. Adorable. It's awful just wearing this old dress when,for once,we are going to Donckers I can imagine you wish for something Last year, we at least had Dad's quarterly contribution to fall back on It was not fun for you when it dried up. Dear Dagmar Frankly, I never thought we would receive that appanage more than the first year I didn't dare to think further I have nothing at all to blame your father. I had no illusions. You, if they were to ask me to sing tonight,what shall we suggest? Let us hope they'll not ask you. Where is the ring? - Emma! -Yes, my Lady -Has Emma seen Mr. Stjärnblom's ring? No Oh, my God, he must have his ring Yes, it doesn't matter, we can't be late to Donckers The ring may be found later Emma, ​​it's probably not that late tonight Emma doesn't go out,I mean if the children should wake up That's all right, come on, come on, let's go. Do you, as a matter of principle, never wear a wedding ring? No, I make it a principle never to have principles -I forgot it, quite simply. -Can you forget something like that? You can forget just about anything. -Forget what? -The wedding ring! What? Forget the wedding ring, listen Now just confess why you put it in your vest pocket No, I certainly didn't, I forgot it. -I have placed it somewhere -Yes, that is absolutely true. Is that true? Arvid is certainly not that kind of husband who puts the ring in the west pocket when it suits him,doesn't he? There you have it,I'm exonerated No, now I unfortunately have to leave -Opera. -Yes of course Mrs. Klarhom-Fibiger as Senta in The Dutchman for the first time Yes, it can't be passed unnoticed The second act begins just before 9 pm,just in time - Will you come and pick me up later? -Of course At what time? I must go down to the newspaper after the opera I can be here at 12 o'clock Or one o'clock or two o'clock Yes,I know that No, go home right away. Unfortunately, I have to go home early. I can never be sure that our maid stays at home with the children. That's a tragedy -Yes,good night -Good night to you Yes,not easy to be the wife of a journalist,isn't it? It's getting worse, Mrs. Stjärnblom Worse? Why? Yes, he doesn't know anything yet, but can you keep a secret? Indeed Senta's Aria from Flying Dutchman Are you happy? No human being is happy. You have to live anyway, as best as you can. Yes, you have to Did I scare you? I knew it would be late because of your newspaper I found your ring. -Well, where then? -In my bed. What are you doing? I'm just checking the accounts You handle the bank loan properly,don't you? Yes,you stay calm Yes that would be awkward if Baron Freutiger and Dr. Doncker regretted signing I don't think that would happen. It'll probably get better soon, you'll see. Dr. Doncker told me something today. Later tonight when you had gone Guess! You will be the foreign editor in the new year. And still have the music column left! Think how much money you're going to make, huh? Then everything is fine. Are you coming soon? Who were with you at the Opera? My sister-in-law, Ester Roslin. She is so fond of Mrs. Klarholm- Fibiger, like you, I understand. What have I written? "Mrs. Klarholm-Fibiger's voice is of that kind." "which evokes dreams and illusions" - - "about a happiness over all human and earthly happiness." "about sensual pleasure above all other sensual pleasure ..." "... about eternity and bliss, and eternal bliss." - Did I write it last night? -It looks like that. It must have been because I was sitting by your side when I heard her. -It's a beautiful ring. -Yes I got it from Markus. He took from me the promise to never wear it again if I let him down. And have you kept that promise? Lydia! Can you tell me one thing? Where is Taunitzer See? Taunitzer See? Taunitzer See I don't know. It's probably somewhere in Germany or Switzerland Are you going there? I probably wanted to If only I could find out where it's. It should not be that difficult. I'm afraid that will not be easy I was awake last night thinking of a place in "NÅR VI DØDE VÅGNER"(Ibsen) And all the time it rang in my ears: "Nice, nice was life at Taunitzer See!" And so I thought that lake certainly doesn't exist ... No, of course not. That lake may not be so easy to find on the map Maybe that's just the beauty of it. Do you remember the time when you appeared on Nationalbladet? Yes I asked you something ... I asked you for something I remember ... A bit vague. But I remember. You replied, "I want to, but I don't dare." Did I really say that? Yes Yes, that was that time. Have you possibly become a bit more brave since then? Perhaps Do you remember? Yes ... and you've hidden it! You got what you wanted. Do you long for even further, even further away? Now I would like to change that line like this: "I want home, I want home to my real home." I just don't know where it is. When did you write this? Some years ago. It was probably a short time after my marriage. "It has since become autumnal." Yes, it has been early autumn for both of us. Ultimately,it depends upon ourselves if we want to make do with the autumn or make us a high summer. Do you still care about me? I can never in time and eternity care about anyone else but you. Once in your poor life, you should still be allowed -to try to find your way to your Taunitzer See I get up before you Which room? Number 12. I was just missing going through the rest of my life without ever having belonged to you That was just missing! That was just missing! Taste this. Is it as usual ? Are you afraid of being poisoned? In that case,it wouldn't be the first time an old husband went that route! The usual taste,I think Are you saying that? That was good, I feel it. Yes, yes,my dear Lydia, I understand ... You're uncomfortable here at Stjärnvik. You would rather live in Stockholm? Yes, I probably would like that And why now? Theaters, social life, and so on. Maybe that too. But that's not the important thing. And the important thing is? That I don't love you and that married life with you is a torment for me. Love? Dear Lydia,I'm an old man, but I'm not an idiot. Have I ever asked if you loved me? No I have to admit that I have a suggestion for you Of course,you'll get your freedom, and 5,000 crowns a year in maintenance provided you spend three months here each year. Two summer months, and one month around Christmas and New Year And in these months everything would be as before between us. I would be very happy if you would give me 2000 a year, without conditions. You still wear my ring Yes Why should I not do that? No,why would not you do that? And yet as it has become between us lately ... Especially these weeks after your Stockholm trip before Christmas I can't have the slightest doubt that you have fallen in love with someone. Your conclusions may be at your own expense Yes,my conclusions ... my conclusions and the consequences! The obvious consequence of your new love is- that you wish me dead and buried every day and every moment ! -Am I not right? -No but Markus You don't have to answer. But I don't want to be the reason that one day will occur some dangerous and criminal thought in your dear little head. I've been very much in love with you,dear Lydia and still I am very much in love And now you should get what you want. What an idyll! Are you going to divorce? Yes, we have agreed. Congratulations. How much? 5000 crowns per year, quarterly in advance. No thanks, 2000. I don't want more than I need for a living But think about your reputation People might think that you have broken your marital duty been fired with a paltry sum But I don't care what people talk about. And luxury I've never cared about No but a small apartment in Stockholm with two rooms and included furniture,then I've everything I could wish for Then let me at least give you money for the furniture. I thank you for that, Markus. "Dear brother Arvid! You have promised to come out to me sometime .. and look at my paintings. " "You are most welcome tonight. There will be also some.. other blokes " "You have to stay overnight. The last train leaves at half past twelve " "and at that time we are enjoying ourselves most.Your friend Hans Bergling." Yes, he's not much for going to bed at half past twelve that chap Hans Bergling Are you planning to go? Well, what do you think? But can you take time off from the newspaper? Yes, it's probably okay. I absolutely think you should go Would be fun for you to come out and get a bit of variety Well, maybe Well, then I'll go Cheers, Brother Bergling. Think about when I wrote that letter then Hans Bergling became almost a living person for me. -How does he look like? -He is small and stocky He has thick black brushy hair Gray-yellow hanging mustaches and a lot of paint smudged on the vest. Shouldn't you give him a pointed beard too? No,it doesn't fit at all for his type! As you wish Imagine being so fake! Yes, that's not normal. Love one woman, and be married to another. It's a life which at most could be excused if I were a poet. A poet is excused for just about anything Nobody is a case unless wanting to Poets are considered less sane people Have you ever loved your wife? I have loved her in a Lutheran way. What is that? Dr. Mårten Luther had almost four hundred years ago the opinion- -that true love arises of itself between spouses when they do the deeds of nature and love with each other. And there may be a grain of truth in that,possibly but not much. No not much By the way, according to Luther, love only belonged in marriage. Outside of marriage , it was not love but fornication. All sorts of ugly things You may love me in a pagan way. -Lydia -Yes I was thinking of something when I went here. What were you thinking? I thought, is it really that impossible that you and I may one day live and grow old together? That I might one day die with my head in your sweet lap? You have a wife that you love in a Lutheran way. I may well be divorced from her in the future Right now it's not possible, it would look too bad Her father has been wealthy but is ruined Yes, I've told you that Yes,yes I haven't asked for anything else. We have to adapt ourselves as we are. As long as it can't be changed for us I'm glad I got my name back And myself It is as if I have regained something that I have lost or neglected. Did you see my nameplate on the door? Lydia Stille. Nothing more and nothing else. And other things should never be on my door either Neither Roslin, Stjärnblom or anything else. I don't pay much attention to a name on a door -but I sometimes dream of a future for the two of us. and you're not doing that I love you. Now you get to blow on it, blow on It was fun to see you in a good mood! It's been a long time since you were seen laughing My dear, I'm so busy all the time. -Emma -Yes,my Lady Now you have to go and drink chocolate. Imagine yourself, music reviews, foreign editing! And every now and then a whole evening with your friend Hans Bergling, well then, I know that. Maybe we should have binged a little less. I don't grudge you that Listen,speaking of him,should we not invite him here ? Yes, maybe we should You know, a pretty weird guy, that Bergling He only cares about two things in this world: painting and drinking. In a family he would be unhappy! Oh my God,but then it's not worth us inviting him, is it? No, I don't think so either By the way, I have so much else to do. Yes, the summer break is a concern Yes, but it was kind of your father to ask me and the girls to stay with him all summer, huh? It's just fun for him to have you with him He is well alone on his farm, of course No,I don't think so. An old forest officer is used to having nature as his best friend Yes of course But in any case it will be fun No, I don't have time with you! I am so busy Emma But it was really your fault that I didn't keep my word to my husband. Yes? I had just read your wedding ad and I also wanted to live once -And you kept your ring on? -Why not? Illusion and happiness it was one of Markus's favorite ideas. I applied it on him and let him keep his illusions. It lasted a long time? No, hardly a year. Why did you tell this today? Because I met him yesterday. I couldn't understand at all that I had ever loved him. What are you thinking about? Nothing Something that I am not allowed to know. No I was thinking of something that once might come And what yet not is, nothing is You must not think such ugly stupid thoughts Not today! Don't you see where we are? Can't you see the water? It's Lake Mälaren. It's not Lake Mälaren It's Taunitzer See. What does it stand for? I have to learn Russian. A foreign editor who can't read Novoye Vremya, it's a scandal Then how do you manage? I have a young man I've placed who comes up and reads the newspaper once a day -His name is Kaj Lidner. -Kaj Lidner A deeply depressed young man. 25 years more or less. At that age, everyone is probably depressive But it's a beautiful name he has Kaj Lidner Well, was there anything in Novoye Vremya today? Not much. But Here I have translated a piece that might interest you -Yes, why not ... -But .. you can easily decide to delete my comments. No. No, by all means. Mr Lidner has strong sympathies for the opposition, I understand? Anarchist,perhaps? Yes, you have to be something while you wait for the end. Why wait? Mr Stjärnblom is right. It would be better to take your own life. If you only had a decent pretext. That wouldn't be difficult to produce. That you are poor and that you are starving yourself I don't call that a decent pretext. No, there are undeniably better pretexts Yes Thank you, thank you, Mr Lidner. Oh, is that you ... I've told you not to come to me other than I'm waiting for you Could have someone here visiting, yes Ester Roslin or someone else. It's something special today. My father is ill. He might die. I have to go to him. Forgive me. Forgive me for speaking so harshly to you. You should never speak harshly to the person you are in love with. Is your father very ill? Yes, it looks like that. He is 74 years old, and he has never been to bed before in his whole life. Oh really Yes, then you must go. When are you going? Tomorrow morning. That was all with that dream. I had enjoyed myself so much that we should have this short summer to ourselves. Only the two of us... My dear... We'll see each other again. You never know. No one prevails over life and death. But I don't know what else would separate us? Don't go! Not now, not tomorrow. Wait a while and see if it is necessary. I'm sure your wife is exaggerating your father's illness to attract you Her letter is simple and factual Don't make an impression of exaggerations or other motives. Just the fact that Dad is in bed shows that it is serious Yes, yes, the duty above all. You go! Goodbye! Goodbye. Arvid We should not be separated this way? Do you want to stay with me tonight? Certainly. As we have had it this summer, we'll never get it again. -Never again -Lydia When you come home again, you have your wife and children with you. And you have your work and your comrades A whole world that is closed to me. And the day will come when I will be more trouble for you than joy. But Lydia! I'm leaving, but I'll be back! I love you! Why should we not love each other always, always? Of course Always, always! Or at least until tomorrow morning! Here, where I lie, I see through the window- -how the Plough travels backwards as usual. It means... ... that I myself am moving forward in comparison with the Plough. All movement is relative. My dear boy ... I'm afraid you're weak for women. Yes, it doesn't need to dishonor a man- -but it can drag him down- -break his path and close his way. Arvid I have belonged to another man, while you were away. I felt so lonely, and I constantly saw you together with your wife. This is over now I wanted you to know before we meet again I couldn't have told you verbally Lydia Who was it? Well, I've deceived and been deceived I have deceived my wife with you and you with my wife. The only thing missing from the symphony is that my wife is deceiving me Even then do I have the right to complain Admittedly, I had imagined that which was between you and me would be something special something unique something outside retaliation laws and such baseness! And of course, I didn't think when I buried my old father in the small cemetery of my hometown on a quiet September day- -that you were out on gallant adventures at the same time! But you have to accept everything. I have to take it as we are But one thing, dear Lydia, I want you to bear in mind... In the case of a woman's lovers you usually apply the arithmetic of the Australian Negroes You only count to three. And any addition is called many. Thank you, that's enough. Yes, that should be enough. I was prepared for reproaches but not for this Really You were prepared for reproaches It surprises me that you did not expect praise. Lydia! What do you want from me? A woman with gallant adventures on her conscience can't be something for you Gallant adventures What do you call it yourself? You wrote that it was not love No,it was not love but neither the other. Don't think about it now. Who am I to judge you? Actually, I've already forgiven you Thanks I have no use for your forgiveness . You will never see me as a repentant Magdalena And never again will you see me as a horrible beggar of love at your door! Thank you, that's enough,you can leave now. I want to be alone. Lydia Never look for anything more from me. Lydia This can't go on. I surrender to your mercy I can't think of living without you. You didn't want my pardon. You scoffed it. But I want your forgiveness. Forgive me. Arvid Arvid ... I thought I saw you from my window but I was not sure it was you Come up with me. No You've delayed too long. You've been torturing me too cruelly and for too long. Forgive me. You came when I saw you getting so desperate This is the last time I ask you, if you say no now ... At least show him the mercy of extinguishing the lights So he doesn't have to see lights in your window when he goes down to the cemetery and stares here He has probably already seen the lights by me It's better that way. Best that he once and for all got it definitely that I am gone for him. Thank you for coming. I didn't dare to ask you. I was so afraid of a no. It was a beautiful funeral. So it was him? Oh he did the right thing! I wish I could do like him. Lydia ... Dear Lydia ... What have I done? He was so kind ... There are many nice boys, and you can't play with them all. ”Arvid!" Lydia... "I belonged to another man while you were away." "I felt so alone." "I saw you constantly in front of me with your wife." So you're still up? How are you? Are you ill? I happened to open the secret drawer in the chiffonier Now you know how it is And you imagine I'm going to accept that you are having a mistress No, dear Dagmar,I haven't thought of it,even for a moment I sincerely wish,on the contrary, that you don't want to put up with it but filing for divorce as soon as possible Divorce? What do you mean? Dear Dagmar,you must not have really understood what it is like I love another Who deceives you, yes! And you forgave her ... That may not be the right word. It's too much to sort it out. But I don't want a divorce. You've been unfaithful to me,that's ugly enough of you If you don't choose that it can be forgiven Forgiveness implies repentance and improvement. I can't promise neither one nor the other. Don't cry, Dagmar. I'm not worth that much crying. I beg your pardon Would you take the forgiveness in that sense? It's because I've hurt you Maybe we both have something to forgive each other before we now part. What do you mean? -Have you heard anything about me? -Not at all. I'm thinking about that with our secret engagement. Yes? What's the matter with it? You knew very well that I didn't want to get married You tricked me into marrying against my will. A marriage that begins in that way must always be a little fragile. Why would I open that miserable box If I had not done it, then everything would have been as before My dear,it couldn't have gone on like this Everything must have an end. At least tell me who she is. Can you believe such a thing? I'll probably find out. Your Lydia may not be that difficult to track down Lydia is a signature. In reality, she is called something completely different. I'm not as stupid as you think. You can greet her from me to be careful. It's late now Dagmar Shall we not say good night? I'm lying here on the couch tonight. By all means, I'll not stop you from sleeping. If you can sleep! Good night Well, you're left! That's nice Then we can drink our night grog here. Maybe the gentlemen don't know each other? They are Editor Stjärnblom and Mr. Törne. Ture Törne who sang so beautifully at our friend Kaj Lidner's funeral. Yes, singing at a funeral is fine, it's at least something personal but by the way, it's the devil's work being a singer and an actor I thought it was a profession that completely captured a person In advertising, yes, but it's a hell of a life I hate to sing and play theater -I want to write. -I think so Write, that's the future! Just look at Stjärnblom! Proofreader, music reviewer, foreign editor And now Doncker has appointed him our flying correspondent as well Cheers! Cheers Not bad -Travel to the continent next week. -Well? Alone? Don't know. We'll see. Yes, travel books are probably fine but I will write theater, I want to be a poet. One has probably several strings on one's lyre. I already have a play ready. Nearly Here you will hear. What kind of theater grandiloquent at this time? No thanks! Yes, but it's not quite finished, I say You can probably only listen to a few test pieces It will be a pleasure for us. The play is about a young woman, Laura von Stieler, is her name Who is married to an old man Historian and philosopher, with a great name and very rich. He owns a castle in Västmanland and the first act takes place there. But she doesn't love him. She loves a young officer who,however, abhors his murderous profession and wants to become a poet Her father is also in the play He is a painter with a world-renowned reputation. And has a whole wall full of paintings in the Luxembourg gallery Well, here we have their scene. Laura to the man: "Do you want to know the truth?" He in a superior mood "I don't care to know " "The truth is harmful" "It's illusions and delusions. which is the essence of all human happiness. " Not so bad,eh? Not stupid at all, a very sensible remark. It is on a terrace by a lake. "Do you see the water?" she says. "It's not Lake Mälaren "It's Taunitzer See." Which is it now? Mälaren or Taunitzer see? Taunitzer see, in "Når vi döde vogner". Construction my boy! You never get that on any stage! Hello. Yes, I'm coming soon. Too much text, of course. Just as the last print form Just a moment "Construction" That can be himself. In fact, I made Laura right after a living model. I can just imagine that. But don't ask me what her name is. You never betray a lady. Sure, of course not. We've had a relationship with her for a month or so Now it's almost over. But we might make a little trip to Norway this summer Is it already almost over? Yes, one should beware of getting stuck. You should at least live a bit first But how you look! How is it? Has anything happened to you? -Oh yes, in a way. -But what is it then? Can't you speak out? I'll try. I have heard incidentally that you plan to make a short trip to Norway this summer. Well? Where did you hear it from? Is there more than one I could have heard it from? But Arvid, now get it over with and tell me what it is! There's not much to tell. You're just the main character in a theatrical play by Ture Törne Written according to a living model The author has also had a relationship with that model for a month A relation? In one month? He didn't mention your name. He's a discreet young man. Yes, I really do know Mr. Ture Törne I don't know why I didn't tell you I haven't been in a relationship with him In that case then Ture Törne would be able to become a real damned good poet for the future -Don't you believe me? -Yes Of course I believe you If I may tell you the whole truth so we've really kissed each other a bit. And so it has become a whole play for him! Yes, as I said, he will probably become a damned good poet! Arvid, you yourself have probably understood that it can't continue like this anymore But if you still care about me -And don't want to lose me -Yes Yes then you have to go through the whole long story With divorce new marriage and everything As hitherto,it can't continue any longer Dear Lydia ... I'll be leaving here soon, and I'll be away for a very long time Yesterday I thought, "Soon my divorce will be over." "Then I will ask Lydia to follow me - now and always." But a piece of the moon has fallen since then. Do you really think this is the moment is it appropriate to talk about marriage? Well yes So I have nothing to save myself for. Where are you going? I'll be the newspaper's traveling correspondent. When are you going? In a week or so. Good bye then. Goodbye. I wanted to say goodbye and also I wanted to give you a memory of me. It's just a small thing A thing that you may have use for sometimes. Then maybe you'll think of me. And you? Don't worry about me. I've made my choice. And stick to it? I love him have never loved so much! Be seated! Pleasant journey. Thanks -When is Dad coming? -He has left. -When will he come back? -I don't know. It can take a long time. But he's coming back. I know he's coming back I just met him whom I used to love. and then I couldn't understand at all that I had ever loved him. Subtitles by Nostromo
