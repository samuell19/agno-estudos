Take off your jacket. Look at the camera. You're allowed to make one call. There are legal aid lawyers for minors. No, thank you. You should call your parents. So someone's with you at your questioning. My parents are dead. We have to wait for Polynices. Where is Polynices? Finally! The bread will get cold. Stop the music. Olive oil. Your the star of the feast. What a treat! Bless the meal, Eteocles. I don't know how. You heard it lots of times. You bless it. You're the eldest. Méni wants to hear you.

Do they eat eggs in your hood? I don't think so. What do they do in your hood? We eat eggs. And we roll in dough! She started it. It's her, not me. A presentation on what? Yo, gimme! I don't want Cutex on it! Give it to her, lsmene. Eat. C'mon, eat. Time to eat. Why won't you say? Because. Would it kill you to tell us for once? It's our family story. Our whole family was leaving for Canada, my parents, grandma, two brothers, sister and I. My parents, grandma, two brothers, sister and I. I was allowed to bring one item in the kids' suitcase, besides my clothes. I thought it over a long time. I don't know how long, I was only three. I couldn't make up my mind which toy. It's fuzzy, but I remember the house was a mess. Because we were moving. A white truck pulled up at the house. Grandma told us to hide. We hid upstairs. My sister told me not to look, but I looked anyway. I saw two men get out. They opened the back of the truck and they grabbed the ends of something heavy and long and threw it on the ground. And they grabbed the ends of something heavy and long I saw my mother's shoe... my mother's shoe fall out and roll next to the two bodies. So we... We left for Canada, but just... my grandma, my brothers and sister. And me too, of course. Or else I wouldn't be here. In Kabylia, in spring, we roll in the grass. Women and men, too. It's weird. Yo. Clear the table. Now you can listen to your music with good sound. Where'd you get it? I bought it used, cheap. You can't bring that here. I told you, I bought it. Move. Let's go, Méni! lsmene! Come join us! Dance with us! Quit worrying and come dance. You're killing the vibe! Dance with your big brother! When I ask it's, No, I don't want to. But Eteocles... Because he's my favorite. No, no! Please, please! Please! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Ouch, shit! He broke all his bones. Know what I could do? Seriously. Just let me show you. Like, with your hair down... Imagine it layered... And a nice little line. A line here. With lots of volume all around. Will you leave my hair alone? Not too close? The $4,000 Meritas Excellence Award this year goes to... Antigone Hipponome. Did you paint that? No. That's a Molinari. I did one for my dad. He hung it over the toilet Hold on, it's him calling. To say he'll be late and that he left... $20. Want to order in? OK, but... if it's raw fish, it's no. Smell it. If you like the smell, eat it. Keep your eyes closed. Wait. I'll give you another one. No fish, right? No, no. Is it Spicy? It's fish. No. Raw fish? I didn't want to... You liked it, right? No, I didn't like it. C'mon, it's amazing! Look. Want another one? No. How can I trust you now? If you lied once, you can lie again. - Sorry. It was for the... experience. What do you think? I dunno. What do you feel? I don't know if it's good. But... it makes me feel weird. It does something to my stomach. Dad, this is Antigone. Yeah, I guessed. I'll drive her home. A pleasure, Antigone. A pleasure, sir. Christian. Call me Christian. lsmene? lsmene, you asleep? I went to a boy's house tonight. What? His name's Haemon. Haemon? Who is he? He's white, a Québecer. Good white bread. Fine for a starter. But don't sleep with him. I don't. Once you sleep with a guy, he drops you. It's him. What's he say? It's secret. You woke me up, what's he say? I want to share all your first times. Blue bandana man's a hotshot. This'll show you. It's the cops! The cops! Hey, guys, what's going on? Dude, what is this? Get off him! Back off! You, too! What's the problem? Eteocles! There's no point in living And surviving the flowers And surviving the flames, the ashes Méni, listen, it's beautiful. It is far better to die each heart a flower Who wrote that? Garneau, a Québec poet. There are poets here? Really, Méni. OI course there are poets. Méni, it's Eteocles! Something's happened! - Don't tempt fate. Stop! You'll tempt fate. Open up, police. Let me go see. Is Menoeceus Hipponome here? We didn't do anything! We weren't armed! We were playing jacks. Eteocles... Polynices, tell me. Where's Eteocles? He fell, like a feather. My child! My child. My son... They're going to take away all my children,. Polynices will be held until his trial. For what? Breaking parole and assaulting an officer. The cop shot his brother! I'm sorry, madame. It's for the judge to decide. Eteocles, please, get up! Eteocles, please, get up! Who shot Eteocles? The police! What do we want? Justice! WHERE'S OUR BRO? IN JAIL WHAT FOR??? HIS BRO'S DEAD!!! For Eteocles, it's done. We must save Polynices now. Which house? The one down there. Méni, ifs not done here. I don't care. I know what's right. I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed. Thank you. Thank you. First of all, my sympathies for the grandson and brother you've lost. It's terrible. I no longer practice law, but I have excellent contacts in the profession. Tell him I voted for him,. Say you voted for him too. No, Méni. We're not in his district. Tell him we're sorry. Our home is so humble. Thanks for helping. Sorry, we don't get many visitors. It's a bit... Don't worry, it's just fine. Thanks. So... Here's how things stand. Polynices's case has created quite a stir. First, he's not a Canadian citizen. We're just permanent residents. None of you have citizenship? It was a lot of... bureaucracy for Grandma, you know. Polynices is a repeat offender. For minor offenses. Now it's assaulting an officer. They take that seriously. He may be extradited. Extradited? The officer shot our brother... before his eyes. I know, it's understandable. But he has a criminal record. No one spoke of deportation. Now he's an adult. For them it's a grave offense, it changes everything. Where'll they send him? His country of origin. Do you know what it's like? Do you know what it's like? A crowded cell where people eat and shit. She says it's hell. I can imagine. No, you can't imagine,. You live in cotton. And you didn't sloop to pick it! Méni, stop! Fucking winter is your biggest worry! Won't he long. Can you draw this? Gang tatts are no joke. I know. lsmene, cut my hair. Here? Right now? Yes. How short? Short, short. You'll look like a boy. Stop! Are you crazy? You got tattooed? Is it the same? It's not permanent. It's a decal. Stop! You want to look like Polynices? Polynices mustn't he deported. He won't survive there. It'll never work. Shut up. This is taking all the courage I have. Cut my hair. I'm scared for you. I'm scared for you. I've thought it over. I'm a minor. My record's clean. I'll get a lecture, but no jail time. There's something you must do. What? Help Polynices after he escapes. Find a safe hideout. Far from the Habibis and cops. Leave me out of his shit. He's your brother. Who should I call? You'll find someone. Don't tell me. Do what you have to. That's all. Polynices! C'mon, I'll show you my car. C'mon, I'll show you my car. My hair's ugly. It's different. But it's good. Anyway, I love you. We could go out west together. To the Rockies. Ever seen a bear? I don't think I'll he able to. I think it'd do you good. Your gran and sister will understand. We'll be back for school, if you're worried. I'll pay for gas. It'll be great, sleeping in the car. Or outside, in the parks. Swimming in turquoise lakes. Hello. Your ID, please. Hello. Hello. Your bags, please. Hood down, please. I have to inspect it. I'm sorry, Méni. You defended your brother. Antigone, what's going on? I'm taking your place. What'll happen to you? I'll manage. I'm useless. I don't deserve this. Polynices, you're not useless. Don't cry, Méni. If you cry, I will too. Go to the States. Get in the car behind the bus. The driver's Shadow. He has a passport I want to go home. Hurry. I don't know how long Antigone has. Gimme a break! Don't go crazy. Not for a fuckin' pack of smokes! I'll see you later! OK, what's the problem? C'mon, get up. Get up! That a chick? We have a Code Black! Backup in A! Guys, there's a chick in A! You stay there! I'm not moving. Back off. - Holy shit! Hey, screw, you got played! We have a Code Black! Polynices escaped, shit! Nice work, Polynices! You're charged with abetting an escape and impersonation. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney. Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to a parent or legal guardian. Do you understand? Do you understand? - Yes. Look at the camera. Where's Polynices? I don't know, sir. Is he paying you? He has no money. The Habibis have money. Guess they didn't want him in jail. I know nothing about them. They never asked me anything. You broke the law for your brother. I have only one left. I have to help him. Sure. Help a two-bit thug climb the ranks of organized crime? Our brother was killed before his eyes. Deporting Polynices as punishment is unjust. Recruiting. That's what he did. That was his job with the Habibis. If you had a kid, you wouldn't want him to chill with Polynices. In fad, ill had a kid in Polynices's hood, I'd move. Look at him. 14 years old. Overdosed on coke. Went into cardiac arrest in a Pikwik parking lot the night of July 17. The drugs that killed that poor kid... came straight from Polynices. You alright, Polynices? You scared me. What's wrong? Nothing. You're still up? Wave an exam. Are you hurt? It's fine. It's what I wanted. I passed the initiation. I'm in! Where's your brother, Antigone? I don't know. I don't know. - Where is he? I swear I don't. What do you know? What I know is... our eldest brother is dead, shot by the police. Can you bring him back? Eteocles. The sports star. The goal-scoring hero. The innocent victim who took a bullet. Did you really know your older brother? You're going to dump on him? Your champion of a brother, I gotta tell you, was no better than Polynices. It's not true. Who paid the rent at home? Not your sister with her shampoo-girl tips. Who paid the rent? If you know, why do you ask? Eteocles. But where'd he get the money? From soccer. Yeah. Do you really believe that, Antigone? You, the brains of the family'! You think your brother earned ii scoring goals in a local league? Eteocles was just as deep in the Habibis as Polynices, but higher up. He kept his hands clean. Where's Polynices? Where's your brother? I don't know. You're getting in way over your head, little girl. Good luck. Open up, police! We have a warrant. He's not here, go away. To arrest Mrs Menoeceus Hipponome. Go pull your turnips! Cops, go home! She needs me. She doesn't speak French. She'll be at Station 34. They'll say how much bail is. Like, I have money? We just serve the warrant The case of Antigone Hipponome, no. 0351-8211-2012. Julie Edouin, prosecutor. Your Honor, the young lady wishes to represent herself. Hello, miss. Please identify yourself clearly. Antigone Hipponome. Guilty. One moment. So you've declined representation by a lawyer, miss? Speak up, you're being recorded. Yes. Are you fully aware of the charges and their consequences on your sentencing? Yes. Can you stale the three charges against you? Well, I helped my brother to... disguise himself as a girl... to get out of prison... so he's not deported... For now, I'm only asking you to state the three charges against you. Legal aid services are free for minors. I strongly recommend them before you enter your plea. But I'm guilty. I'm not sure you grasp the ramifications of your plea. You haven't seen the evidence against you. I'll enter a plea of not guilty so you can meet with a defense lawyer. Do you have a parent or legal guardian here? Our grandmother is our guardian. But she was arrested last night. Your honor, the accused is the legal ward of her grandmother who was arrested on two of the same charges: Articles 463 for plotting and 141 for assisting someone in breaking out oi a penitentiary. She was not involved. Thank you. I'm guilty. The court must follow a certain procedure. You can decide to plead guilty later, but you must consult a lawyer first. Prosecution recommends? Prosecution recommends? Your honor, our fear is that the accused may attempt to flee and thus not appear in court. We recommend the accused remain in custody. You can't lock her up! Quiet! This is your only warning. Until a ruling, the court orders you be held in custody at the St Rose Center for Girls in Laval. Shit! You can't lock her up! Her brother was shot by the police! She's clean. She's an A student. You can't lock her up for no reason. This is bullshit! Your charges are serious, miss. For an adult they carry a five-year prison sentence. You could be transferred to an adult penitentiary when you turn 18. You will find a lawyer, or the court will assign you one. You are required to keep the peace, to not carry real or imitation weapons, to respect the Center's rules, and have no contact, direct or indirect, with Polynices Hipponome and Menoeceus Hipponome. Need I say how awkward this is? We have to help her. Politicians are prohibited from intervening in court cases. I'm not asking the politician. When she was home, I could help her. Why did she do it? She's in the same shit as her brother now. You'll shower, put on clean fresh clothes, then tour your rooms and common area. The routine's simple. Wake-up 7:30, obligatory shower, breakfast till 8:30. obligatory shower, breakfast till 8:30. You can eat what you want. Your choice. Can I make a call? - Hold your horses. After breakfast, you have class. It's urgent. My grandma was arrested. The code of conduct. Hey, the food's here. Wow, thanks! It looks super gross. Thursday's supposed to be pudding. We have an egg allergy in the group. Is it you, scab face? No, it's me. You staying long? She will if she behaves like you. Watch out. She can spring you from the pen. This center'd be a piece of cake. I want pudding. Tonight there's Jell-0. No smoking, no sex... I want my fucking dessert! You'll get your dessert, without eggs. I tried to see you, but they sent me away. The cops came. But not for Polynices. They arrested Méni! Careful, we're being bugged. But who's helping her? A legal aid lawyer. Doesn't give a shit, 'cause we have no money. Doesn't give a shit, 'cause we have no money. Where is she? She spent the night in jail? We have to put up bail. I scrounged at the salon, but I came up with only $300. Bail costs ten times that. My award money... Take it. My hank card code is the year we came. Shut the luck up! We're sleeping. What's your goddamn problem? Nobody's gonna cuddle you here. Are you kidding me, a fucking panic attack! Calm down. You're in the Girls' Center. Hi. Hi. Hello. I'm Ms Genest. I'll evaluate you to determine your level. So you're placed in the appropriate group. Antigone, right? Yes. You're finishing high school? You went to school every day? You went to school every day? Answer these questions. Emilie, I don't know your level, so we'll start with basics. At first it may be easy, but the questions will get harder as we go along. Shall we read the first question? It's multiple choice. Go ahead. Do you usually wear glasses, Emilie? Can you read this word? Trees." How many trees?“ Can you read and do arithmetic? Thanks, Natasha. Hello. Justin O'Neil, legal aid for youth of lenders. I want to defend myself. It's a court order. You need to have a lawyer. Not necessarily me. I can argue that the police violated your rights. I can have your deposition invalidated. I just said the truth. You had no lawyer. That will allow us to start over. But I'm guilty. It's me or Polynices. Antigone... - Or worse, my grandma. A guilty plea means a criminal record. ll lasts 5 years after your release. Everything you do will he monitored. It'll be noted in your file. The tiniest infraction... Possession of drugs... - I don't do drugs. Possession of drugs... - I don't do drugs. If you're picked up at a protest... The least bullshit. They'll come down hard. The RCMP archives your file, they don'! destroy it. You'll be stuck for years with guys like me. If you want to travel abroad, or if you're turned down for a job - and that's sure to happen... You can be refused at certain schools. Above all, there's the media. Blogs, Facebook, social networks... Have you looked yourself up? No Internet since I was arrested. Give me your phone, please. It can be someone else, but you need a lawyer. Not someone else. You're OK. They have that picture? They know. - You betcha. It was on TV news. They describe the escape.

I'll have to ask everyone to leave. Everybody out. We'll adjourn for 15 minutes. Proceedings will resume behind closed doors. Hurry up or you'll be fined. I broke the law, but I'd do it again. My heart says to help my brother. My heart says...“ That's good. Your grandmother is home. Subject to certain conditions. She can't be within 150 meters of you, or talk to, write or email you. Or ifs hack to jail. A fine for contempt can he paid by cash, debit, jail time or community work... Debit card. They arranged for their cells to ring all at once. A female minor whose name cannot be divulged dressed up as her brother... Sorry. I saw the hip-hop squad on my monitor. Antigone! Antigone! You didn't have to pay for me. No? What, I leave you there? And the papers say my son was arrested and I didn't help. So your public persona overrides your duty as a father? So your public persona overrides your duty as a father? My duly as a father? When I pay for your fuckups, that's my duty as a father. I work till midnight, roll up my sleeves the next day, shut my mouth to toe the party line, and keep my job, all to provide for my son. All I do is for you. I never asked you to. I'd prefer you speak out when you disagree. He talks like a kid. Old folks can learn from kids. I don't need you to get me out of anything. You're old and scared and want to save your ass. Fuck you! Haemon! Haemon! Shit! This program sucks. My turn! You don't own the remote! Stop it! Two months after Eteocles Hipponome was killed by police... Yo, girls. It's Antigone's brother! ...his family is in the news with the brazen escape of Polynices Hipponome, who was in jail awaiting deportation. Our reporter is at Youth Division Court. As you can see, here's a lot going on here. The youngest daughter of the Hipponome family is accused of helping her brother escape. As we know... Antigone, it's you! ...whose identity we cannot reveal, disguised herself as her brother during a visit to the inmate. While she was taken back to his cell, he, dressed like her, escaped and is on the loose. You're a star. You go, girl! The Center's scared shitless of the media. I heard that! Cool, what you did for your brother. The accused then proclaimed, I broke the law, but I'd do it again. I broke the law, but I'd do it again. My heart says to help my brother. Antigone. You have to see. She's been there since dawn. We can't stay here long. Talk to her, Lyne. Tell her to go home. I already did. She's respecting hail. 150 meters from the Center. She'll come every day. When will I be released? Correctional Services want you gone. They don't like attention. MY HEART TELLS ME Who's she? Halima, an educator. Because the Center embraces all cultures! They're increasing the staff. All for you. I love watching them freak out. Emilie, wait a sec. Put this under your sheet. Chantal, did you get training for this job? What? A bit of tact, I dunno... Mind your own business! Our business. It is our business. There'll be a consequence. And the consequences of what you do? Go think in your room! Go think in your office. I thought.

It's a special visit. Haemon doesn't know I'm here. We're not talking. He lives in the garage. You don't know? I get one call a week. I get one call a week. He quit school. He organizes day and night in support. No idea where he showers, or if he showers. I know he's young, he has to find his own way. But at 17, he doesn't realize what's at stake. I believe in him. I believe in him, too. But not everyone agrees. Attacking the judiciary, the graffiti... He's acquiring a record he'll never shake. You're upset? I'm upset to see him ruin his life for... I don't even know what his goal is. He doesn't want me to feel alone. And where will it end? When he winds up in a police station, lacing charges, like you? You can't want that for him. I understand, you love him. How do you do it? How do you love your brother, despite... I love him, that's all. You'd sacrifice your freedom for him? Sacrifice your life? When I'm unsure what to do, I think of the little boy. Little Polynices, stretching his arms to he picked up. But nobody picks him up. He's lost his parents. Girls... C'mon, Lyne.

As stated, my client pleads guilty to all charges. I've spoken to my colleague. Since it's a first offense, and she attended school regularly before the events, and she's socially very well adapted, we recommend a suspended sentence with 60 hours of community service over the next four months. And the prosecution? Your honor, we have new evidence. I'm listening. I have a new witness. It's not on the roll. This is a last-minute development The witness was arrested last night.

What do you have on your shoulders? Is it a head? Or just a fucking wood stump with holes so you can get stoned? Miss, for your sake, lei the proceedings... I vomit on your proceedings! I'm talking to my brother. Your honor... Your honor! You and your ceremonies are ridiculous! Now you listen to me. This is your last chance. Do you care about getting citizenship? Citizenship? Citizenship... A piece oi paper? Pardon? You can go wipe your ass with it! The court will recess for 10 minutes. 10 minutes to bark orders, your honor! Convicted, Colonel, sir! Your disguise as a citizen hides your heart! Where is your heart? I don't see it. All I see are fancy uniforms and keys and titles... Let go of me! Polynices! Polynices, what were you thinking?

Please, can you stop calling me madame? Yes... sir. Alright. I'm here to do a psychiatric evaluation. I rarely prescribe drugs. So, what happened? Nothing you haven't already read about my family. I've read nothing. I prefer meeting face to face. So, do you know why you're here? Here? Before you? Yes. I have to make an impossible choice. Which choice? Citizenship or my brother. Civic life or family. How old is your brother? 18. You feel responsible for him? I'm responsible for my family. You're responsible for your future. I have no future. My family has lost everything. You've taken a lot on your shoulders. Relax a bit. I can't. Why not? Because of the dead. Where are the dead? They're here. Like us? Stripped of their sheath, but here. With us. You fear their judgment? More than that of the living. The combat between the law of your heart and of man is insoluble. I'm sorry, there's no other outcome. You shall be walled up, alive. These are sedatives. Next one in four hours. Antigone. I have to take you back in two hours. I have a proposition for you. I've asked lsmene and Menoeceus. I could become your legal guardian. You could live here. This would be your home. I'll pay for your studies, even after age 18. As long as you need. But I have a guardian. I have Meni. She wants to go to her village, with Polynices. It's her choice. Méni... Is it true? You want to go back? I'm going home. I have great affection for you, Antigone. Allow us to help you. Allow us to help you. Can the three of us speak alone? Of course. Méni, if you go back, all of this will have been pointless. I'm leaving with Polynices. But if you leave, what will I do? Méni, what will I do without you? You're my home. What do you say? If it's what she wants. I can't take ii. You can't take what? I want a normal life. But we're not normal. We can't erase our family's past. I can. You want to forget us? I don't want my family to decide my life. You'd forget us to gain what? The little life they are peddling? You'd reach for the happiness they toss to you, like to a dog? Know what I want? A bank loan for my hair salon. A small hair salon, four chairs. I want to get married to a decent guy, with no record. I want to get married to a decent guy, with no record. I want a house, all my own, with kids in it. That's what I want. A normal life. Like everyone. Is it too much to ask? Is it too much? Too much to just want to be normal? Help yourselves, please. Christian? Thank you. The bathroom? Downstairs, on the left. Wait, hold on. It's right here. Haemon, take me outside. Haemon? I want to make love with you. What? It's with you that I want to make love. Subtitles: Robert Gray,
