Captioning made possible by lions gate entertainment Here's the result from the third race. First, number 6, aldaniti. Second, number 3, baker's dozen. And third, number one, family servant. Distances were 8 lengths and 2 lengths. Bob champion's win on aldaniti is his 50th of the season. That puts him in second place of the jockeys' stable. Well done, boy. Jumped well, didn't he, sir? Yes, he enjoyed himself, I thought. How'd he go? He was, stood back a bit over the first open ditch. But after that, he jumped super. He learns quick. So, what did you think of him, Bob? I'm gonna win the grand national on this horse. Aldaniti's my kind of horse. He's got a back like an armchair. And a bum like a battleship. He's a real old-fashioned steeplechaser, and clever. He'll jump anything you point him at, and he'll gallop forever. You'll need all that to win the grand national. Just how long is that crazy race? 4 1/2 miles over 30 fences. Mass suicide. You should know. How many times you ridden it? 9. And how many times have you even finished the course? 3. You want to know my opinion? You don't want to know my opinion, so I'll tell you. Turn this holiday into a permanent arrangement. Then next season, stay right here in the states. You don't have enough steeplechasing. Well, that's true, but the money's better. Over there, you guys get peanuts for getting your neck broke. I say, quit while you're ahead. You want a job? You can have one right here. Any time you want it. Thanks, burly. I really do appreciate that. Will you let me come back next year? You know you're always welcome here, Bob. Well, I say one thing for America-- got a better class of vet. Son. Don't fool with her. She's a tough one. Hello... Whoever you are. Is there a waiting list? Where does it hurt? Ooohh. Oooh. Yeah. Ooh, that's the spot. Ooohh, that's wonderful. You know, my father wanted me to be a doctor, but I hate people. Pets aren't much better. You know, like poodles and persians and stuff like that. You only do horses? Horses and cattle. Beef or dairy? Don't do that. I spend all my time fending off guys like you. I'm glad you made the exception. I feel safe with you. Do you, why? Because you're going back to where you came from. Wait a minute. What does your doctor say about that swelling? Well, haven't you seen a doctor? Are you crazy? I got kicked by a horse. We fell together, I was trying to grab the reins, and he gave me one. How long ago was that? 3 months--stratford. Shakespeare. You're right on track. It doesn't hurt anymore. It's just that the swelling hasn't gone down. Well, do my a favor, see a doctor about that as soon as you get back to england. Why? Because. If you say so. I say so. It's not contagious, is it? No, I don't think so. Sis? Hello, Bob. I'm going into hospital tomorrow for an operation. What is it now? It's not serious, is it? I want to kill myself. You'd better tell me. I've got cancer. What are you doing here? You telephoned me and talked a lot of rubbish. It's gone. One or both? One. You'll be all right. You don't have to worry about your weight, Robert, so you might as well enjoy it. Did they say how soon I could ride again? No. Call Josh gifford. The number's in there. Make it 5. Right, gov'ner. Mr. Gifford? Yes. It's Mary hussey. Bob's sister. I've got Bob for you. Hello, gov'ner. Bob, where are you? Well, the fact... The fact is I'm in hospital. What's the matter? They gelded you at last? The technical term for what you had, if you're interested... Yes. I want to know everything. Good. A malignant teratoma. Now, this type of cancer might be expected to spread through the lymphatic system to the abdominal area. There's no sign of it there, but the x-rays show a shadow in the chest. A mass. Now, we're not sure of the nature of this, so, I would now like to remove a small section of the rib to get to that mass. What...there? Yes. I know what that is, I was hurt in a fall about 2 years ago. It's a...Scar. Let's hope so. But I feel fine. I feel wonderful. I don't need another operation. What on earth do you think you're doing? Just going for a stroll. The anesthetist is waiting! You're having an operation tomorrow. I feel fine. I feel perfectly well. Come on. Please? Can you get rid of the flowers. Makes it look like a funeral. I'll take them to the children's ward. Hello, Bob. Gov'ner. How are you feeling? I'm feeling great. You should've seen me on Monday, I looked like Frankenstein, tubes going in and out. But I'm feeling fine now. I should be out in a couple of days. Well done. Well done. My... My wife sends her regards. How's aldaniti? He's very well. He's enjoyed the summer. Mind you, he needs time. Got belly on him like a mare in foal. Got a present for you. Can you manage a drop? Doctor says I can't. Well, mustn't waste it. Nick... Who does he think he is? There we are. Christ. Here's to you, Bob. Your health. Yes, your health. Well, the plan is to give aldaniti 3 or 4 runs, while the going's good. Let him down through the winter. And bring him back in the spring for the grand national. That is, if the owner agrees. The owner always agrees. Just put that in writing, Nick, will you? Shh. Shh. There are sick people here you know. What's the form now, Bob? Well, they'll let me out on Saturday. And... Then I shall go home, amd I'll wait for the results of the test. Ok, now listen. Nick is my witness. Whatever happens, however long it takes, you're my first jockey. And your job will stay open. That's a promise. Thank you, gov'ner. Well, how long have I got to live? Without treatment, 8 months, a year at the most. I still feel perfectly fine. You were lucky you were diagnosed so early. We know the nature and extent of the cancer. We know what it is, and we know how to treat it. If I don't have the treatment, can I still go on riding? For a while. Well, I think that's what I'll do then, maybe I'll get lucky and get killed on the race course. Mr. Champion, with new chemotherapy, you stand a chance of complete recovery. What do you mean by complete recovery? I don't want to get stuck in a wheelchair and live to be 90. Life to me is riding race horses. In a couple of months, it will be too late to change your mind. The drugs we give you will kill the cancer, but there will be unpleasant side effects. What's in it? Just a saline solution, salt and water. Now, the doctor's going to put this in your arm. If you can keep it there, then we won't have to keep jabbing you with needles.. Just a sharp... That's the idea, anyway. What's this now? Platinum. If you feel sick, don't drink. Vinblastine. Bleomycin. You will need 4 courses of treatment. 6 days in hospital each time, and 15 days at home to rest and recover. Mary... Thank god you've come. You've got to help me. What's the matter, Bob? Gotta get me out of this place. They're trying to kill me. That's not so, Bob. They're trying to make you better. They're using me as a Guinea pig. They just want to try out new drugs on me. Nurses wouldn't do a thing like that. They're only doing what they're told. It's all right. Don't worry. Listen, you're coming out on Friday and you're coming to stay with us. I can look after myself. Uhn. This could go on for months, at least until Christmas. He'll be in and out of hospital-- back for treatment, back for tests. It's all right for me, he's my brother. It's perfectly all right, Mary. Hello. Ok. Hang on a minute. Uncle Bobby! Uncle Bobby! It's difficult for you. And for you. Let's just hope he gets better. Don't worry about it. Uncle Bobby! I want to get in there, please. Who was that on the phone? Caroline. Caroline who? Caroline you know who I am. You've been in there for days and days. You didn't pull the chain. If you can't go, why'd you sit there all day? Ask a silly question... Is that why your food comes back up again all the time? I saw you riding the pony. I know. I'm good, aren't I? Henry's leaving you behind. When he jumps, you've got to go with him. You should've said I'm good. It's more polite. Do you want me to be polite, or do you want to learn to ride well? I think you're wonderful. Hello, Bob. I thought he was dead. This one's a tearaway. They won't want to take you on. Try and settle in front, but go with him. Give him his head. Unh. Hello. A customer. What's the name? Champion. What a nice name. Mine's bill. Some people call me hiawatha because of the scalps. It's not funny. Now, Mr. Champion. You can settle for the yul brynner look, or...you can have one of these. Courtesy of the health service, my dear. Hello, i'm--I'm looking for Bob champion. Is he allowed visitors? Visitors? It's like piccadilly circus in here. We've had everybody in except the horses. I'll check if he's awake. Bob? There's a girl to see you. Do you want to see her? Hello. It's... Back to front. That's better. Looks quite nice. Did I wake you? I'm sorry. No. How are you feeling? I'm feeling fine. The cancer's all right. It's the medicine kills you. I'm sorry. I can't remember your name. Jo...beswick. Did you used to work for Nick Anderson? Yes. Yes. You rode a winner for us at cheltenham. King Billy. You remembered the name of the horse. It's very important. She's not his type. Certainly not! Not like you. It's just that I don't like those sort of parties. Tell you the truth, neither do I. Well, you couldn't blame me for thinking that you did. You can think what you like. Those girls follow the jockeys about. They get what they're looking for. I brought you something. It's a big one. Had to be light, it's for when you start riding again. The doctor says that the tumor in my chest is reduced. Yes, it is. Look. Look here. Ready for your bath? What bath? He wants a bath before he goes home. I stink. It's only the platinum. Maybe, but I still stink. I'll do that. I can manage. No, you can't. Now, I'm going to bath you. And you can just relax and enjoy it. Stop trying to be a hero. Making a bloody nuisance of yourself. Now, Bob, when you get home remember what doctor said. A scratch or bad cold can kill you. At the first sign of any infection, what do you do? Call the hospital. Yes. Can you read x-rays? Yes. That tumor on my chest. Is it really getting smaller? Yes, Bob, it is. What's he doing now? Winning the whitbread or coming third in the gold cup? The gold cup. Tea? Yes, please. Hello, Bob. Shut the door. It's freezing. Aldaniti puts in a really big one here. You watch. One day the 2 in front will fall over, and Bob will win it. ...and now as they race up towards the final fence of the gold cup. Tithe cottage and alperton. Tithe cottage on the far side alperton and near side. There's very little between them now. Tithe cottage lands in the lead. He's a fallout! Tithe cottage is down at the last alperton is striding away to win the gold cup... Uncle Kojak, if you only came third in the gold cup, how are you going to win the grand national? Because the national is a mile longer, and the fences are much bigger. Then you'll fall. I've ridden him in 19 races, and he's never fallen once. Aldaniti will jump anything you point him at. He'll gallop forever. He'll win because he's a brave horse. There are different sorts of courage. Fighting is the lion's courage. But running is the courage of a horse-- running and jumping. A horse will do anything for you if he's genuine and he loves you. Uncle Kojak. That girl's here. What girl, aunt Emma? The one that said she was coming. That's Jo. She's not a girl. She's a friend. Hello, Bob. How are you feeling? Very well. I'm feeling fine. Tea! Who'd like some tea? Right. I--i rode shamoon. You know, my horse... In an amateur race at stratford. Just for fun. When? Last week. how did he do? Well, that's the story. We...stayed on the outside to keep out of trouble. Not trying to win or anything. He was jumping really well. Got to the straight. There were only 2 in front of us. I had to have a go, didn't it? How did you do? What happened? We fell at the last. You shouldn't do it, you know. You might get hurt. Aldaniti is almost ready. Aldaniti is almost ready. Good. I'll find him a race in a couple of weeks. I'll be there. I won't be riding him this time. No. No. Of course not. I didn't expect you to. Just wanted you to know, that's all. Don't worry. I'll be ready for the national. Bob! Bob, the cows are out. Come and give us a hand. I'm not feeling well. This won't take long! I'm dying and you're worried about your bloody cows? Just stop moaning and come on. Uncle Bob. Uncle Bob? Uncle Bob? Hi, Nick. Uncle Bobby's dying. Where's the thermometer? Where's the damn thermometer? Em, get daddy. Quickly! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Mommy needs you! Uncle Bobby's sick! Quickly! Hurry! Good evening, sir, are you aware-- I've got to get him to the hospital. Which hospital would that be? London cancer hospital. Follow me, sir. You're a lucky man. So they said. You'd have been dead in a matter of hours. Your white corpuscles have packed it in. Of course as soon as they find out what the infection is, they can treat it. Right. I'll take this one and that one you've got. If you need me again, Bob... Thank you. How did you manage that? I told him that a horse ate the other 2. So now I've got four. We'll be glad to get rid of you. When is it, Friday? Thursday. You sure? Yes. I think you're wrong there, Bob. You speeded up the drip. Well, if blood poisoning didn't kill you, perhaps nothing will. Now, Bob, I had hoped that your tests would show you're in the clear. But unfortunately-- you said that I might need a course of radiation. Did I? Yes, that might do it. But, it would also increase the damage to your lungs. If you really want to ride again, I'd continue with the chemotherapy. You have a couple weeks to think about it. We're nearly there, Bob. Nearly. But not quite. All right your side, snowy? Ok, gov'ner. All right. Will members of the public clear the course, please. Spectators on the infield are asked to stand well back from the fences... Hello, Bob. Snowy. Gov'ner. He looks well, doesn't he? Isn't he looking well? Yes. Well, you look after that young jockey out there? Yeah? Will he win today? No... he'll need the race. Bob. It's so good to see you back. Yes, indeed, very good. Hello. Hello. Aldaniti has been pulled up. Christ. Here are the returns on the fourth race-- first, number one pays £3 exactly... Places number one, £1.20... Bad, Nick. Tendon's gone. Does he want to put him down? That's your decision, isn't it? We can take him home at least. Bob... There's always a chance. No, Jo, he's finished. So am I. Now, he must stay in this box for 6 months. 6 months. Minimum. And there's no guarantee he'll be sound at the end of it. Might have been kinder to put him down. That's out of the question. Hello, Bob. I want you to disconnect this thing. Will you take it off? What's up? Take it off. I'm going home. You can't give up now, Bob. Treatment's almost over. Sit down, Bob. Let's talk about it. I don't want to talk about it. All right. Take the drip off, leave the cannula in for the moment. You take a walk around the hospital. Have a think about it. I'm gonna call my sister to come collect me. Will you take it off? Can you help me, please? What are you doing here? I--i just came out for a walk. It's a nice hospital, isn't it? Much better than the one I was at before. Is it? Are you going to die or are you going to get better? Going to get better. Steady now. You'll make me tipsy. Thank you, dear. That'll do. Granddad, it's from daddy. Thank you, darling. Come on, give us a kiss. Give these to Bob, darling. They came yesterday. I'll open this one. Will you? Then I'll open this one. Ok. Look. It's a get-well-soon card from aldaniti. Whoa! Come on, honey, sit down. Let's see. He's carrying overweight. Hey, dad. What's that? What about this then? 1,000 quid from the governor and the owners. That's proper. That's very proper. Isn't that nice? One of the painted tarts? Hope it's the one I fancy. I know who that is. That's Jo. She's not a girl, she's a friend. No, Nicky, not yet. Bob, bingham here. Sorry, who? Dick bingham. Good morning. Mr. Bingham. Free Tuesday week? Yes. I want you to ride a horse for me. No. I'm afraid I can't. Why is that? I haven't been very well. Thank you. Yes and a merry Christmas. Happy new year to you, too. I'll be in touch. All right. Bye, Bob. Bye. He offered you a ride, didn't he? Taunton. Tuesday week. Well, it's nice to be remembered. The cancer's gone. There's no trace of it. Anywhere. You're in the clear. What? I'm in-- the clear? Yes. I'm all right. Mary, I'm all right. Bob! Uncle Bobby! Yes. Let's go! Come on, Henry! Keep on. Go on. Go on! Henry. Henry. Come on, Henry! You did it! What's he think he's doing? He's mad. Yea! Uncle Bobby. Bob, are you all right? You idiot! Look after yourself-- you mean get someone else to look after you. Someone else? One of the tarts. What's wrong with that? Stay a couple weeks longer. I've stayed too long already. What you think you're gonna do? Right out. Get fit. Get back as soon as I can. Bob. You're cured, so, it's time you face facts as well. Riding again was a dream. It helped you through your illness. Don't waste your breath! The doctor told you your lungs are permanently damaged. You're as weak as a kitten. You've no feeling in your hands or feet. Bob, you can't ride a bicycle. Yes. It will take a little time. Sick or not, you were gonna have to face this sooner or later. What are you gonna do with the rest of your life? You can't be a jockey forever. Where you going now? I'm going for a run. You're mad, Bob. Stark-staring mad! Easy on that one, John. Morning, Bob. Morning. What's he like? He's a nice ride. A gentleman, proper Christian. Easy on that one, Bob. One steady canter, that'll do for him. All right. Lead off. Bloody hell! Where are you going, Bob? Not strong enough, is he? You're a stuffy bugger. Can't you take him for another spin? You ride with me, Bob. Peter will take him in. Come on, up you go, Peter. Hard work, is it? It'll be fine in a few weeks. No, it won't. Why don't you go away for a while, Bob? Somewhere nice and warm. Take it easy for a while. You just go on around again, Bob. I'll wait on you right here. Y'all having fun? Hello, ed. Hello, Marilyn. How you doing? So she's beautiful... And smart... And gentle... And tough. I'll bet she can god damn knit. No, I don't think so. Do I still have a chance? She's ridden a winner. Hi, girls. Hello, Bob. Barbara. Hello, sir. My god. What is it? Hold still. Didn't you know you had that sticking in your hoof? No, sir. Is that why you run around barefooted all the time? Thinking maybe someday you might feel it? How about your hands? My hands, they're fine. Is that a fact? All right, we're gonna run a little experiment here. Now you shut your eyes, and I'm gonna put this bottle of beer in your hand, and tell me when you got hold of it. Is that a deal? Yes, fine. All right, Barbara, you help Bob up on this bench over here, get around behind, cover his eyes. Don't want no cheating. Fair's fair. I don't need any help. Right. Now... Here comes the bottle. You got it? Yeah, I've got it now. You're holding that cold bottle of beer? Yeah. You are in trouble. No, it's terrific. At least I knew I had hold of something. Burly. Burly. Burly! Where are you? Burly! Burly! Burly! Where's the fire? Look! Look! Feel it! Feel it! Peach fuzz. Can I borrow your razor? Sure, help yourself. Got a hairbrush? Get out of here! I don't believe it! How about Marty's anger? That's a $25,000 race. I don't want the responsibility. You don't want the responsibility? All right, you can have a ride on rooster at scuffle. No, thanks. What's wrong with him? He's not a safe conveyance. What's the matter? You scared? You've got to get started again, Bob. How about a flat race? I've never done it. There's nothing to it. All you do is just set still and steer. We'll teach you the rest. How about it? Good. I am going to take it easy to the 3/4 pole. Ok? And you catch him if you can? Right. You ready... Yep. Hey! Good ride, Bob! Perfectly sound. That's wonderful. Do you know what you said to me on the telephone? "It's me." It's me who? It's me Bob. I hadn't heard from you in 6 months. I was in America. That explains everything. Well...it does, and it doesn't. I didn't think you'd want to be bothered with a sick man. I came to see you when you were sick. Yeah, but that was different. How? Well, I don't know, but... It's... It's how I felt. Um... It's not quite what I mean, but I didn't feel any use to anybody. You are now? Yes, I am. I want you to come and live with me. Bob! You're the limit. I haven't just been waiting for you. I've gone back to school. I'm doing a business course. Whose idea was that? Mine. Well, that's a bloody waste of time. I need you. I've got to get myself back into shape. I've got to find rides. I'm gonna be very busy. You want me to live with you? Yeah. It'll save a lot of driving back and forth. You haven't done any yet. You said to me, "meet me halfway." This is 5 miles for you and 50 for me! Yeah, but it's a great pub. You want me to live with you. You don't love me or anything like that? That goes without saying. No, it doesn't. You mean, if I say I love you, you'll come and live with me? No. Jo... You're being unreasonable. No. I can't do it. I can't offer you anything more. I've got to live from day to day. No, Bob. Not just like that. Champion's 3 pounds overweight. Are you happy with that? Well, the horse goes well for him. Well, you're the boss. Hello. Bob. Welcome aboard. I've got a decent bet on you today. I don't want to know. Jockeys, please mount. No, that jockey's just got out of the hospital. He doesn't look very well, does he? They never recover fully. So he's loyal to his jockey. How about his bloody owners? Hello, Josh. Another pack, please, Joyce. There you are Mr. Gifford. Thank you. They're running. Apple wine from bisclair and whispering Bob... Bisclair has unseated his rider at the fence, and that leaves sisyphus in the lead, now followed by closest to burn... He's not up yet. I hope he's broken his bloody neck. Thanks for the lift. At least the horse is all right. And that's the main thing. Next time, I want Richard roe. Is that clear? I'm not subsidizing a fat cancer patient. Is that clear? If you don't like my jockey, I suggest you take your bloody horses somewhere else, sir. Thank you, Bob. What for? Coming all this way. I didn't have a ride today. Is that why you're in such a temper? Yes... Well, no. What else? I still don't know why you're here. It'll be useful, whatever I do. Tell me, Bob, when you retire from riding, what are you going to do? I'm not going to retire. Well...i don't know. I'll go into business or start a haulage firm or something. What about training horses? It's expensive. You could handle the horses all right. What about the books and the bills? Yes... Yes, you would need someone to do all that. You've got it all worked out, haven't you? Yes. Jo, you don't want to settle for me. You don't know what I'm like. Yes, I do. I'm a stubborn, selfish, bloody-minded bastard, no more, no less. I don't think so. When I was ill, they told me, because of the drugs and all that... They told me that I might never be able to father a child. Do you think you could live with that? No winners. Look at them. 12,000 guineas. 15,000. 13,000 guineas. All in there eating their heads off. Now how many times can we tell an owner his horse isn't right? Bob? They're working well enough at home. Exactly. That makes it worse. All right, Bob. What happened to newsboy yesterday? I don't know, when I asked him to go on, he...had nothing left. You're making too much use of him. Had him in front too long. You can't blame me, gov'ner. The horse isn't right. The horse isn't right, there we go again. The vet says there's nothing wrong with him. Yeah, well, the vet didn't ride him. The vet could've bloody won on him! It doesn't look as if you're gonna make a come back riding my horses, does it? His horses are running badly. He bloody well knows that. Did you ring any other trainers? They've got my number. Anyway, they all want me to ride light weight, and I can't make the weight anymore. Well, you know, sis, the doctors've told me to lay off the pills and the laxatives. And I can't make the weight anymore. Well, have you thought about going back to America? That trainer burly Cox, he looked after you. America...it's all right for a holiday. It'll be for you. Yes. Bob, it's Judy. Josh wants you to ride out first lot on Tuesday. Can you make it? Yes, of course. Good, I'll tell him. Did he say particularly? No, he didn't. He just asked me to call you. All right. See you then. Bye. He wants me to ride work on Tuesday. He didn't call me himself, he got Judy to do it. He hasn't got a ride for me on Saturday, but we wants me to drive all the way over there and drive work on Tuesday. So what do you make of that? He wants you to ride work! He wants to tell me I've lost my job. All right, I want you to ride carbo and Henry bishop at ascot. All right, gov'ner. Well, come on, Bob. I want you to say hello to someone you know. Hello, big fella. Well, you took your bloody time, didn't you? Yes. Well, now we see if the old horse still wants to know about this game. Jumped like a stag, do we go again? No, that's enough. He's entered at chaltnam Saturday. We'll run him. Hope for the best. So, look, um... Help yourselves, won't you? And, plenty of drink. And Don--don't stint yourselves. Royal Charlie on the outer. Aldaniti making a forward move. Did you see the way you went by him on the turn? Yeah, he was pulling my blood hands out all the way around. And aldaniti's putting in a great run. How's the horse? Fresh as a Daisy. Doesn't know he's had a race. Coming to the bench now. Aldaniti going well. Well done, Bob. Great ride! Thank you, Mrs. Gifford. It was the gov'ner who brought him on. Aldaniti coming away up the hill. As a matter of interest, what were the odds? 14 to 1. Did you bet? No, no, we were just hoping he'd get 'round. Back to business. So what do we do with him now? We'll see what his legs are like in the morning. He did run well, didn't he? Wouldn't mind another shot at the gold cup. That's too close to the national. He can't run them both. The national's always a risk. It's up to you, Nick. Well... If his legs are all right tomorrow, we go for the grand national. Bob? The others had better start running now. There's something I want to say. What is it? Well, I've... Been going better lately. I've had a few winners. I want you to buy a ring. Is that enough? What sort of a ring? Um... Engagement ring. Wedding ring. You might as well get both. I mean, if... That's what you want. You're on. Spartan missile and royal male to worry about. There's old rubstick. He's won it before. So has ametka curry. Well, maley's useful. We have the only class horse in the race. Here's to all the brave horses. I think they have. Did you have a bet? Months ago. Soon as we knew he was sound. 500 at 66 to 1. What year was it for you, Josh? '67. Honey had... Came in second. Wouldn't mind riding this one tomorrow. Spartan missile. Evening, Nick, Josh. John. Hello, John. Zongalero. We are going to win tomorrow, Nick. Yes, I know it. I've had a feeling. Irish. God bless 'em. You all right, Bob? Listen... After dinner, why don't you and Jo go off somewhere? You know, a disco, or something like that, and get yourselves really drunk. Relax. Best thing. Best thing. Actually, if you'll excuse us, we were just leaving. So, thank you. Thank you. Are you going, Bob? You all right? See you tomorrow. Right. Good night then. Thanks. Good night. 'Night, Bob. * here comes the bride * * all dressed in white * * da da da da da da da da da da * Good boy. Spot on. He took a real hold. That'll do. All right. Want to walk the course alone or come with me? With you, gov'ner. Come on, darling. Keep up. He won't fancy that. I'd take him 'round the outside for the first circuit. Don't even think of winning. Hunt him 'round the back. That's harder than a brick wall. We only have to jump it once. If we get this far. I thought you had a feeling. It's called terror. Nick, let's go home and take aldaniti with us. Good idea. This is a silly game anyway. But we don't want to disappoint those two, do we? Some of them won't have the heart for it. Give yourself room. He'll love this. Give him something to think about. Grab hold of this. About time for a glass before we go. Sir? Sir? Here's to you, Bob. Good luck. Good luck. Good luck, Bob. Thank you. You've come through. Win or lose, it doesn't matter. I'm bloody well going to win. You want to look nice for the telly. Stand still, you old sod. "My hopes, my prayers-- "and my money-- will be on you on Saturday." "Kick on, Bob. We're all rooting for you. Burly." "My son has died of cancer. "For us, it was not to be. "But your success must be made known and shouted from the rooftops." "Good luck, uncle Bob!" Well, the flag's in the place. Hope nothing goes wrong. "Would you like to go in front," she says. "That's up to you, madame," I says. "That's entirely up to you." That's it, Bob. Ok, next. You haven't ridden the course before? No, no, no. Nothing to it, only trouble is, you can't see over the fences. You're liable to take off and find old John Thorne on the other side, having a cup of tea. I'll need something stronger than that by that time. Hey, look out, grandad. 11.2. That's the way I make it. Good luck, Bob. I hope you come second. Thanks, John. Same to you. How much weight did you lose for this last round? 35 pounds. Looks good, doesn't he, Bob? Too good. Number four, sir. Four, Bob champion for aldaniti. Any extras? Breast pads. 10.13 with breast pads. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Jockeys! Pay attention. Now, listen to me. A word of warning. There are 40 of you, and it's a long run to the first. It'll do you no good to set off going like the clappers. You've got four and a half miles to go, so steady. That's all. Good luck. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Good luck. Thanks for everything. Come on! Get away. Let them through. Stand back. Come on, Bobby. Peter! Move ahead. There he is. Where is he? There. Can you see? Where have you been? It's almost post. Come on. Quickly! Come on! I'm coming! ...Pulls hard, and he's very bold. So the first three fences are-- you missed uncle Bobby in the parade. Shh! Take it off. When are you going to give up smoking, guv'nor? You worried about my health? Well, I'll tell you what. You win today, I'll give up smoking. Don't got out in front too soon. Right, Peter. They're now moving up behind the one-stram cape. They're under starter's orders for the 1981 national. All right, jockeys, line up please! Try to remain quiet. Don't get right on top of the tape. Come on, clear it up in the back. Steady, steady now, clear it up in the back. Steady, steady. All right, come on! On the inside is coral festival, then zongalero. On the wide outside is Sebastian as the leaders come towards the canal turn. And at the canal, it's carrow boy who leads over it from choral festival in second. A bad mistake there. Where is aldaniti, for god's sake? On the outside going over is aldaniti. Come on, Bobby! Aldaniti! He's gone to the front! Christ, Bob, what are you doing? He's in front too soon! And they're running down towards the chair. And as they do so, it's aldaniti over on the far side. From zongalero... Come on! Come on! Come on, Bob! Hey! 12 horses still in the race as they come to the 23rd bench. Yay! Come on, Bob! Come on! He's done it! He won it! Aldaniti wins the national! You're beautiful! Bob, you are beautiful! Bob! Bob!
