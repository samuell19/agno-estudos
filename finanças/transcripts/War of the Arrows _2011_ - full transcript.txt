WAR OF THE ARROWS Get them. Don't let them get away. PARK HAE-IL Get them. Over there. RYU SEUNG-RYONG Don't let them get away. Over there. MOON CHAE-WON KIM MU-YEOL Get them. Don't let them get away. Father. Look at me, son. Are you afraid? Answer me. Yes, sir. I am. The only way to conquer fear is to face it straight on. Father. His name is Kim Mu-seon. He lives in Gaeseong. Father. I'm staying with you. Father. Father. Father. From this moment, you're her father. Look after her to the end. You got that? Yes, sir. Get up. Father. Go, my children. Find the traitor. Father. Father. Hurry. We must go. Father. Don't let them get away. I'm going back. Please, Ja-in. He's fighting them. We must bring him his bow. He told me to look after it. Don't you understand? I'm going back. Let me go. Let's go back to him. He needs his bow. Nam-yi, please. We got the traitor. Find the traitor's heirs. Nam-yi. Nam-yi. Nam-yi. Nam-yi. Nam-yi. WAR OF THE ARROWS Did you witness his death? You must be Ja-in. Did he leave any words? Those ignorant of diplomacy enthrone the new King. Alas, the destiny of our nation hangs by a thread. Take care of this bow until my child grows. Jeon Chu Tae San. Bal Yeo Ho My. Have Lady Kim prepare fresh clothes for them. Yes, Master. Get changed. Don't go wandering about. You must never talk to strangers. Is that clear? Father... Father. From now on, you're her father. Look after her to the end. You got that? It's coming your way. - Nam-yi. - She's coming your way. Go after it. I'm doing it. Nam-yi, she's going that way. He missed. It's hit. He got her. He got her. Over there. Wait. What's the matter? Where are we? What do you mean? These are markings for tiger traps. Let's get out of here. Wait. Did you hear that? Yes. - Tiger. - It's a tiger. Tiger. Run. It's a tiger. Tiger. Tiger. Oh, good tiger. Where is my dear one? My darling as soft as feathers. Tiger. Oh tiger. Good tiger of Mt. Songak, The other day, I went to the so-called Songak's finest joyhouse. Didn't quite live up to its reputation. No? Miss Ja-in is the prettiest in all of Songak. She'd have eligible bachelors line up for miles, if only... Cut the crap and have a drink. Lady Kim is just being unfair. Miss Ja-in is more than a good match for her son. Take her elegant demeanour for example. On top of that, she is beautiful. The young Master has nothing to offer in comparison. You're right. I said cut it out. What's his problem? That's enough. You know the circumstances. I know very well. I was speaking out of frustration. Shut your trap. Jerk. I was speaking on your behalf. You called me a name, didn't you? Think you're better than me for speaking the savage's language? I'll rip his mouth up. Teach him a lesson. Calm down, man. Please. - Get off me. - Please, sir. I'll kill you. You insufferable troll. Go on. Knock it off, both of you. I thought I would drop by for a drink. Good evening, sir. Does a fist fight arouse the appetite? What was the fight about? What brings you here at this hour? Come and have a drink. I think we can use a change of scenery. Let's go some place decent. A good boy like you knows a decent place for a drink? You'll see. A hell of a spirit for a joyhouse. This place is famous for its fine liquor. Indeed, it's rather refreshing. - Easy with the sword. - Wait. Allow me. What do you want? I would like to pour you a drink, brother. Brother? Please. At last, you're treating me with some respect. I hoped to discuss a matter of grave importance. I would like to make an offer for Miss Ja-in. What? As her husband, please accept my offer. Does Lady Kim know of this? What about the Master? I can persuade them. I'm dead serious. Please say yes for the sake of our friendship. Aren't we closer than anyone? Says who? Says I. Have you lost your mind? We're family. Besides, you're talking about marrying a traitor's daughter. Are you wanting to ruin your life? I know what concerns you. I assure you I can persuade my mother. We lived under the same roof for so many years. The years she had to endure caring for traitor's children she never wanted. Will you burden her for the rest of her life? - But Nam-yi. - Also. Think about Ja-in under such unhappy mother-in-law. My mind is set no matter what you say. I'm prepared to do anything for her. Anything? Fine. Here is my condition. Condition? - What condition? - Hey. If you cut me, I'll give you my blessing. But if you fail, I shall take my sister and leave town tonight. Is that clear? I don't know what you're trying. Hey. Look at you, pretty boy. Weak as a kitten. I'm the son of a military official. I'm going easy on you. I'll never give her to a sissy like you. I would rather have her marry a butcher. A butcher is good. That's enough. If you'll excuse me. We're not done. Sit down. Mindless drinking and fighting. Life is all fun and games for you? Yes, sir. I have no worries at heart. The world seems like rat shit to me. It's been 13 years since you came to this house. You have abandoned your studies and trainings. You're wasting away your days. Should I serve in the court or defend the country? I'm the son of a traitor. I'll just live today and drop dead tomorrow. Your father was the King's loyal servant. - I am well aware of that. - And, yet, And, yet. I saw clearly how a loyal servant is valued. What's the point? You're all doomed for the same destiny. Isn't that why you're hiding in the countryside? How dare you. If there is nothing more, I need to drink some more before I sober up. Did you know that I gave your sister her name? And, your father named my son. I'm giving my permission to marry Ja-in. Jeon Chu Tae San. Bal Yeo Ho My. Hold it up like a mountain. Pull it curled up like the tail of a tiger. You should use your elbow rather than your wrist. What are you doing out so late? You shouldn't be here. Why did you do it? What do you mean? Forget about getting married. It would be for nothing. Unless the King is overthrown or the country falls, there is no hope for a traitor's children. You'll only end up getting hurt. You're always like this. Why did you run? Only to live like this? We should have died there and then. Coward. At least, I won't live like you. You'll marry him without my blessing? This way. Thank you for coming. What are you doing here? You should be at your seat. Bride bow twice. Groom bow once. - Sir, your turn. - Come on. Are you alright, sir? Will he make it through the wedding night? Bride bow twice. - Look at him smile. - Shush. Get into positions. Close the gates. Close the gates. Get into formation. Launch the attack. What's going on? Evacuate. Run. Madam. Gang-dug. Gang-dug. Protect the Prince. Ja-in. Let her go. Madam. Ja-in. Savages. No. No. The sword. Father. Ja-in. Father. Where are they taking us? Keep walking. Keep walking. Keep walking. This is war. Don't feel sad, dear cousin. He broke the Mangudai siege with his bow. I never saw a Joseon man shoot like him. We didn't have full unit for encirclement. I thought their bows were weak. Their bow comes from the same root as ours. Shorter and thinner but with good range and mobility. We must not underestimate them. Jyushinta. Wanhan. The captives exceed our number. I salute you, my uncles. Have a safe trip, Your Highness. They're ready for you. Hurry back. We have a lot to do. Long live, Manchuria. Long live, Manchuria. Commander, we're ready to go. Hu-man, take care of His Highness. Yes, commander. Our fallen brothers, as well. Yes, sir. Ja-in. Ja-in. Ja-in. Ja-in. My dear. Who will look after my father's shrine now? Mother. Spare me. Golden flag embroidered with a blue dragon. Please. I'll decide after you answer. They're headed north. That's all I know. The arrow penetrated the neck. His death was instant. For all of them. We must hurry. It could be the act of a militia. Take this one. Commander, you should see this. It happened in the blink of an eye. He was there one moment and disappeared. And arrows came flying in again. They came from an impossible angle. He speaks our language and is chasing the royal banner? That's what he said. Did he shoot red arrows? How did you know? I don't know who he is, but he is after the Prince's troop. Then he said something puzzling. Why don't you just kill me? My bow's purpose is not to kill. It wasn't his bow's purpose to kill. Abort the mission. Nirus, follow me immediately. Is that the last batch? It is. Brothers, we're going home. Interpreter. Interpreter. Yes, sir. Listen carefully to what I say. Once you cross this river, you'll never be able to go back to your country. You all know that once you cross this river, you'll be deemed a traitor. Those who want to run, I'm releasing you. Pardon me? Well... Okay, okay. He says you can run if you want. Now is the time. This is your last chance. Don't you miss your home? But, you know you mustn't run even if he says so. I'll count to five. Those who want to go home, go now. Sit tight for five counts. Then, you'll live. One. Two, Three, Four, This is your last chance. - What's going on? - Don't be agitated. Eun-yi. See you back home, father. No, my child. Eun-yi. Eun-yi. People of Joseon, you can go back home whenever you wish. Just never as a living man. Get them. See? It was an evil ploy to test us. Wretched monsters. My child. Eun-yi. I'm stepping UP... Sir. If even one of them can make it back alive. Master. You'll get yourself killed. What's going on? Come and get me. You'll have to come through me first. Have we no warriors among us? You. Crawl on your knees to me like your king did. If you don't, my arrow will pierce your heart. Kill him. Damn it. What happened to laying low? Let's get them. Ja-in. Let's go. Freedom. Freedom. Ja-in. Don't blame me too harshly for losing her. Didn't I promise you? That I would do anything for Ja-in. She'll be waiting for me enduring with fortitude. Are you going to be okay? Even if we have the enemy's map, anyone crossing the river back home is deemed a traitor. The king who abandoned his people is himself a great sinner. You. Clean her up. You brought an feisty one today. Forgive me, Your Highness. Take off her clothes. I'm a married woman. Do not put me through this disgrace. Stop. When did you learn our language? I learned it from my father who served at the northern border. Then, you must know about the greatness of Qing China. Don't put me through this shame. I beg of you. Even your king swore allegiance. How can you consider this a shame? How can you consider yourself to be an honourable man if you persecute your prisoners? Do you see this? It's tiger hide. My courageous uncle Jyushinta gave it to me as a present. If keeps me from cold and heat and rain, even fire. This soft hide is stiff at first until it's properly tanned. The process of tanning a hide can be quite fun. Have her stand outside until she begs for life. Only the strategy map is missing. We must track him down at once. The bodies of the brothers shall be taken care of by rearguard units. Yes, commander. This is it. Insufferable savages. Is that Miss Ja-in? Wait till sunset. What difference will it make? We can't just go without a plan. Look at their numbers. We'll take the leader as a hostage and exchange him for Ja-in. It's the only way. Will that to work? What about an exit strategy? After we get Ja-in, we'll cross the river and meet back at this hut. By tom morrow noon. - Okay. - But, Nam-yi, we don't have a plan on how to catch their leader. - Gang-Du. - Yeah? There is something I want you to do. What is it? How boring. This is no fun. Your men have no backbone and women have no fidelity. I'm curious. What broke you down so quickly? Was it thirst or hunger? Or misery? My father the Khan once told me, men and animals alike, the best way to control them is with food. Looking at you, I see he was right. My father once told me, one's vision is clouded when one is hungry. So, one must always fill the stomach before a fight. Are you saying you're a warrior? I'm a warrior's daughter. I shall not beg for my life, nor shall I die in vain. Damn. Disrespectful bitch. Yeah, that's more like it. Go on, try again. Don't give up. What's going on? The prisoners are getting away. Your Highness. Do not interfere. Anyone who disobeys me shall be killed. Leave us. But, Your Highness... The prisoners are getting away. This way. Come on. Follow them. Who the hell are you? Long live, Manchu. Manchu? Manchu. Yes, Manchu. Manchu, Manchu. Tza-it. Tza-it. What? I see now how stubborn and stupid Joseon's women are. That skewer is all you have. The strategy worked. Let's get out of here. Can you take it from here? But, Master... - Master. - Master. It's them. Get those two first. Let's go. Who the hell are you? Are you hurt? Nam-yi. I'm sorry it took so long. Release the Prince. Or, I'll kill her. Madam. Who are you people? What are you doing? - Your Highness. - No. Step back. Nobody move. Shoot him. Hold your bows. - Go now. - What about you? Remember what I said? I'll meet you at the hut tomorrow noon. We'll be waiting. No. You're coming with us. You want all of us to die here? We leave together or we die here together. Don't tell me to leave you like this. Madam, we cannot all go together. Wait for me. I promise I'll see you again. You think you will live after what you have done? I wouldn't have done it if I cared to live. Are you afraid now that you're time is up? The firewood has almost burned out. Thank you for holding up so long. Where is His Highness? He was assassinated. Please. Commander, he went in that direction. Our men went after him. Nam-yi. It's great to see you again. You made it. What about Miss Ja-in? And, the young Master? They should be ahead of us. How fortunate. We must try to catch up. I'm sure they are going after them, too. Gang-Du, over there. What the hell? Now it's reds instead of the blues? It's the half-pounder. What? The arrowhead alone weighs over half a pound. It's more powerful than a mechanical crossbow. We must go into the woods. Get into siege formation. That doesn't look right. Let's go this way. We need to cut through here. Come on, let's move on. Nam-yi, I think he's right. - Let's go. - Come on. The path ends there. We got them. We must capture him alive. He shall suffer until his last breath. Come on, hurry. Gang-dug. Look out. We must hurry. Gang-dug. Gang-dug. Gang-dug. It's a miracle I got this far. Leave me. Gang-d... Gang-dug. Go. I'll hold them off as long as I can. Gang-dug. Go on. Gang-Du, No. - Get going. - Gang-Du. Cut the net. I can't move. Help them. The marking for tiger traps, it's the same here. I can't go any further. I'm too old for this. Gab-Yong. Gab-Yong. Go on. Take care of Miss Ja-in and the Master. I'm taking one of you with me. Shoot. It's him. He's still alive. We'll cross. Adai. Naigada. Let's cross. Adai. Come on. Adai. Wanhan. Hurry. Let me go. Get him for me. Don't give up. We're falling behind. We must pick up speed. - I'll do it. - Let me. You have blisters. They say if you cross back to Joseon, you'll be punished. They wouldn't do that to their fellow countrymen. It's probably to stop people from crossing over. Sir, I'll hang on to that. I'll get some drinking water. Get back inside. Madam. MY eye. Madam. Chase him. Gotcha. Keep chasing. He turned back. Let me ask you a question. Why didn't you shoot me at the cliff? Was it to bring me into contempt? He shall suffer until his last breath. Cut off his limbs. Look out. Which way? I'm not sure. But, there is only one way. Just one way? The river border is close. We'll catch up. Hurahu. Come to your senses. I feel something ominous in the air. Are you not a son of Manchuria? Hurahu shall take the lead. One. Two. Three. Four. It's the short arrow. The same sniper arrows we saw at the battle of fortress? But, it has a jagged tip. There is no arrowhead. He made it from a regular arrow. It makes no difference for us. My brother. Hurahu. Don't come this way. Stop. Ja-in. Madam. Nam-yi. My darling. All this trouble, to save her? Are you calculating the wind? I already saw your arrow. There is no point in calculating the wind. Did you fear for your girl? You may know how to shoot curved projectiles. But it's your fear that got you and your girl killed. Now, it's your turn to feel the pain of watching your loved one die. No, Nam-yi. You'll die if you pull that arrow. You lose. No, Nam-yi. Now you'll sacrifice her? Even the wind isn't on your side. Fear, you simply face it straight on. The wind is not to be calculated but to be overcome. You... Nam-yi. I have the other one here. You knew they were from me. Of course I did. There were so big. Only you can get it so wrong. They were too big for you? I thought you were all grown up. Maybe not so much. Ja-in. Ja-in, let's go back to our home in Seoul. We'll go home. Wear pretty silk shoes. Look. It's our land that we must go back to.
