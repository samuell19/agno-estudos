Next up is entry #14! Take it away, Saori Namiki! Singing Contest I'm sorry. Can I start over? -I'm sorry -As many times as you need! I'm sorry Good girl, Saori! Thanks, Shu -No worries -Sorry, Shusaku You should be! Just kidding -Saori! -Come, Saori! -Wait -Just take it! Got it. Say... Cheese! You're the best, Saori! You should read this -Is it good? -It's for your future Love comes when you least expect it! Saori's first date Will you think about it? That's amazing, sis! Saori is a very talented girl -You'll never be a singer! -Why not? Never say never Yutaro Professor Niikura says she has talent... -Shut up, Natsumi! -You shut up, Yutaro! Why? She's my daughter! Stop it, both of you! Saori wants to give it a shot Wait until you graduate high school Good! We can touch it up Pay attention to the flow ‐The take is good enough to me ‐Same here I don't want her debut song to be a college work It's just a demo tape! Rock, paper, scissors! Cho-co-late... Saori Namiki had a bright future But she disappeared around 8:00 pm on March 29, 2019 That was 3 years ago On the 2nd of this month in Shizuoka Prefecture, Makinohara there was an arson case Bones found among the ashes are now confirmed to be Saori Namiki's Why her body was found in Shizuoka 200 km from her home in Kikuno City, Tokyo, remains unclear The autopsy confirmed a large gash on the back of her skull Her death wasn't caused by fire but a brain contusion from some kind of blunt force She was probably dead before the fire started Another body was found at the scene Yoshie Hasunuma, age 83 occupant of the house set on fire Her death was prior to Saori's and her body was abandoned there More importantly, we discovered that Yoshie's son was living in Saori's hometown at the time of her disappearance His name... Sorry I'm late I know you're busy It's fine. But why me? -Go on -Sir Kanichi Hasunuma, age 50 lives in Edogawa, Tokyo but his current whereabouts are unknown Kusanagi! Mr. Kusanagi! 15 years ago... On May 12, 2007 A 12-year-old girl named Yuna Motohashi disappeared in Adachi, Tokyo Her body was found in Okutama 4 years later Abduction, murder, corpse mutilation and abandonment... The suspect that emerged during the investigation was Kanichi Hasunuma, a worker at Yuna's father's factory But as 3 years had passed the only crime he could be tried for was murder But Hasunuma... remained silent Totally silent... So you couldn't charge him? I did But he maintained his silence. Even on the stand The whole time? Didn't answer one question The composition of the dirt where Yuna's bones were buried... In both trials, he was found not guilty. The prosecution gave up He was awarded over 10 million yen for damages and legal expenses 10 million yen? But those who had an even harder time accepting this verdict was Yuna's family Case dismissed The accused is not guilty. Yuna's mother, Yumiko Motohashi took her own life And now, Kanichi Hasunuma is back Excuse me. We found Kanichi Hasunuma Let's go 3 years ago you killed Saori and hid her body in your home in Shizuoka Isn't that right? Give it up, Hasunuma We found blood stains on your work clothes at your apartment in Edogawa Chief... Take a photo These are your work clothes, right? They match Saori Namiki's DNA I see you got promoted? What? Last time you were there Mr. Kusanagi What about this time? 《Silent Parade》 I'm home! Professor Yukawa? Sorry to call you out of the blue It's been a while What are you doing? I was fascinated by the motion of these soap bubbles I thought maybe it's the paramagnetism of the gas inside But it's probably the ambient air I thought you didn't like kids Just not my thing Right... Why Kikuno? I've been researching superconductivity at a lab here for a while Superconductivity? Yes. Superconductivity is when electrical resistance vanishes and results in the Meissner effect -The room temperature of super… -I don't need to know Sorry So what is it? Your email was quite vague We have a case Namikiya's eldest daughter disappeared 3 years ago and was found as a corpse 23 days ago at the home of Hasunuma's parents What's more, Hasunuma lived in Kikuno when she disappeared They had contact -May I take these? -Pour for me! Please stop! What are you doing? I'm a paying customer We don't want your money Get lost! Hey Saori disappeared a little over a month afterwards Her body was found 3 years later and Hasunuma was brought in But no matter how much evidence Mr. Kusanagi presented... or how hard he interrogated him Hasunuma didn't say a word Once again, he clammed up and was released Prosecutors say an indictment is unlikely Yuna's case 15 years ago made them cautious He was released? For now, yes. But we'll keep... Can this... be happening? Officer! You mean... Are you telling me that man won't be accused? Hasunuma's father was a detective Back then, securing a confession was everything Maybe he bragged that he got a suspect to confess I think Hasunuma learned from him that if you remain silent, you won't be charged If so... one could say that the police have created a monster The police created... Don't say that to Mr. Kusanagi! He already blames himself He believes that Saori would still be alive now if he indicted Hasunuma in Yuna Motohashi's case He should be back soon He feels responsible for this crime? Yes I don't know why but Hasunuma returned to Kikuno after being released Until 3 years ago he worked for a recycled goods company there He moved in with an ex-colleague who still lives in their storage unit Even a monster has friends Will you help us, Professor Yukawa? I don't see how a physicist could possibly help in this case Maybe so... What do you want from me? Does Kusanagi know you came to see me? -No -So this is all your doing Kusanagi never asked you -But you and Mr. Kusanagi are… -This is police business Not mine You're cold-blooded and incapable of tears! Being a professor didn't... People often say cold-blooded and tearless but did you know a tear is blood with hemoglobins filtered out? So blood and tears are virtually the same There is no need to juxtapose ''cold-blooded'' and ''tearless''. Bloodless would suffice Yet blood runs in my veins so you made a juvenile mistake -Forget it -And another thing You said, being a professor... -Forget it! -Professorship and blood are... One month later Thank you! Long time, no see, Tomo! -Yeah -Come in! Welcome back What'll you have? Um...a beer on tap One beer on tap! -A box? -Box... -For easy access -Maya Hi, Tomo! How are you? I brought the posters Thanks! Have a seat Our freezer stopped working at the busiest time of year What's wrong? Nothing. I'm glad everyone looks well Or so it seems Here you go, Professor Yukawa Today's special -Looks delicious -Thank you What's this? It's so pretty Look We folded space panels and put them on rockets They will then unfold in space It was inspired by Japanese origami How interesting Amazing, right? Thank you Is this your field of research? Unfortunately My work is neither refined nor glamorous What then? Excuse me, but I'm curious Most people will never engage with my research ever Still curious? I'll pass His meal is getting cold! Go ahead, professor Thank you Refill, please A little higher A little more Nice! Right? Kikuno Story Parade It's our biggest annual community event It's more like a costume contest Teams from all over Japan will enter so the quality will be pretty high Come see Team Kikuno!

What's the theme? That's a secret for now Pardon me Will you come? I'll show you around I look forward to it Really? Yay! Welcome... Beer -Dad! -What is it? It's him! What are you doing here? I came here to eat. It's been a while You son of a... Who is that? How dare you come here? No idea -This man… -Natsumi This man killed my sister! Hasunuma? Omelet and fried chicken Get out Hey, I'm the victim here What the... I was treated like a criminal and lost my job, thanks to all of you It's your fault You're the killer! Then why am I here and not in jail? Because I didn't kill anybody, right? Dad! Yutaro! -Get out! You bastard! -Calm down! You turned the police on me with false accusations That's defamation You lousy... Forget the beer Next time, we'll talk about compensation Wait! Tomo! Tomo! Stop it! Stop! You all suck Welcome! Are you still open? Yes, but we close at 1:00 PM Take any seat Welcome Car coming through! Car coming through! Please make way! Welcome to the Kikuno Story Parade 2022!

Applause! Rumi! Rumi! Over here! That's Professor Niikura's wife Excuse me. May I? Hello, Professor Yukawa -Hello -It's hot, isn't it? It's Mom -What is it? -Where's your husband? He went ahead. He's judging the singing contest I'll be right back What? A customer got a stomach ache. Dad took her to the hospital -The hospital? -Sounds bad Mom's going too, so I have to get back I'll bring this later Thank you. Will you be OK alone?

The music is quite impressive My husband would be happy What's that? A frog...monster? -It's Kiku-non -Kiku-non? A PR mascot? Not very cute And next! We have entry #12, Mei Ando You were a singer too? Oops! Sorry! Do you have a CD? I'd love to hear it Oh, no. I never made a debut Didn't have the talent Was Professor Niikura your teacher too? Yes, he was I never thought we'd get married, though What a romantic story! Saori, break's over A forbidden love between a teacher and his student Enough chit-chat. Back to work! Yes Mr. Tojima You always look cool, professor Thank you Having fun? Yes, indeed We'll meet at Namikiya no matter how Team Kikuno does Is everything OK? Yes Good. I had to return this anyway What's going on? The body was discovered 30 to 120 minutes after death So time of death was... Between 3:00 and 5:00 PM Cause of death still unknown Mr. Kusanagi No one was watching him? It's been two months. The director took us off him Who found the body? Eiji Masumura. He lives here I already told the police last night Can you tell us again? I watched the parade then played some pachinko Tell us how you found Mr. Hasunuma When I came home I noticed something was odd back there Then I noticed he wasn't breathing So I called the police Did he always take sleeping pills? I don't think so You were living together. Were you close? He called me 2 months ago He offered to pay half the rent if he could stay with me He said he'd sleep in the back room You worked together until 3 years ago But then he disappeared Why did he quit? I don't know Did he ever mention a restaurant called Namikiya? -Namikiya? -In the Kikuno shopping street A customer got a stomach ache. We panicked My mom called and said they were taking her to the hospital We left the hospital around 4:30 PM It's been confirmed. The Namikis all have alibis OK Actually, check their alibis again Again? Thanks Are you suspecting that family? It's Professor Yukawa Can we talk about Hasunuma's death? -You're a regular at Namikiya? -I was there last night Doing what? Eating, of course But how did you become a regular? I haven't seen you in ages, and you're interrogating me Answer me Utsumi didn't tell you? I've been doing research in Kikuno for a while I heard. She consulted you without telling me Sorry Kusanagi, do you suspect the Namiki family? You're not answering my... Professor, the cryostat is ready Thank you Yukawa...Yukawa How did they react to the news of Hasunuma's death? Everyone there was shocked How about the three of them? Well... Ready? Congrats on winning silver! Come on, cheer up You guys did great! Hasunuma...is dead Dead? Mom, Hasunuma is dead... The dad was relatively calm The mom and daughter looked totally confused No unnatural reactions? Unnatural? I'm just telling you what I saw -Lower it by 2 degrees -Got it You think they had something to do with Hasunuma's death? No idea But you're not denying it The truth can only be revealed through positing a theory and then proving it Hasunuma's cause of death? Most likely suffocation No broken blood vessels typical of strangulation No bruises on his neck or signs of a struggle Cause of death is still unclear But we found traces of sleeping pills in his blood Sleeping pills But Hasunuma wasn't in the habit of taking sleeping pills Someone drugged him Even if he took the pills he'd wake up if he couldn't breathe He'd struggle if someone tried to suffocate him What if he were tied up? There were no marks I want to see your report and the crime scene Why do you care about this case? Not the case itself The family that runs my favorite diner is accused of murder Of course, I care Gloves Detective Hasunuma laid a tarp down and slept on a mattress on the floor May I go in? A claustrophobe would have a hard time in this space Some people are perfectly fine in capsule hotels It locks from the outside Because it's a storage room What about it? I need a screwdriver It won't come off Why are you trying to remove this lock? I got it! Let me see I knew it What? Tell us already This sliding door has a secret window Secret window? Hey! Excuse me What about this hole? You can extract oxygen through this hole What? With a vacuum cleaner, for instance Suck the oxygen right out Are you serious? -That's… -Impossible Yukawa How else would you lower the oxygen level in here? If you seal the door and fill the room with some objects the room's volume would shrink resulting in a shortage of oxygen Through this hole? It barely fits a marble Fill the entire room with marbles? Impossible -What about balloons? -Balloons? A deflated balloon would fit through the hole with the neck facing us Once the balloon is pushed through you could inflate it from this side -No way -Unrealistic Never Dying in a room filled with colorful balloons sounds surreal and kind of fun But he could easily pop them He'd never suffocate But what if they weren't filled with air? -Not air? -Say helium gas Helium gas? You could use a tank to fill the room with helium gas through this hole Helium is lighter than air so the gas would accumulate at the top That would push the air out through the space around the door The oxygen level would drop and Hasunuma would wake up, suffocating In his struggle to breathe he'd gulp down a lungful of helium causing him to faint No, no, no. That's unrealistic, too That would explain the lack of evidence of a struggle And the absence of broken blood vessels You too? Why would anyone go to so much trouble to kill someone? Good point But if the killer used a method similar to what I just explained there must be a special reason -Special reason? -Like what? Professor Yukawa? -I don't have a clue -Not surprising Very interesting indeed The theory's worth testing If Yukawa's hypothesis is correct Saori's family would be in the clear That family could never come up with such a convoluted plan -Calm down, please! -What's your point? If Hasunuma's murder was a vendetta your family had plenty of motive -Get out! -Do you admit you had a motive? What's wrong? I'll take my leave for now That's my umbrella. The black one -Get out! -So harsh A reporter? Are you OK? You too. Leave us alone Mr. Kusanagi doesn't want this case to be a vendetta for the Namikis That would mean he's responsible for turning them into murderers Are you willing to drive Kusanagi into a corner? Do you think the truth only brings unhappiness? I don't want another mistake either It should be good It is I was thinking... Your theory on how Hasunuma may have been killed It's so much work If the killer went through all that trouble maybe the intention was to inflict fear -Fear? -Of a slow, agonizing death A brutal killer gets the execution he deserves A very original idea But if so the killer must have hated Hasunuma's guts In which case the Namiki family wouldn't be in the clear I thought you were worried about Kusanagi I am...But I'm a detective So is Mr. Kusanagi I was also thinking It can't be helium gas -How's it going? -Still prepping What kind of experiment? I couldn't possibly explain It's ready Shall we start? Ready The boiling point of this liquid is minus 196 degrees It vaporizes the instant it comes in contact with air The cooled vapor then turns into tiny water particles floating in the air creating clouds inside the room Clouds? Oxygen level? Just under 16%. Fatal when it's below 8% What's in the tank? Liquid nitrogen Liquid nitrogen? We emptied 20 liters Thanks You'll have to wait or you'll suffocate in there I asked Utsumi to confirm something The amount of water in Hasunuma's mattress when his body was found Ready? Hurry. Sunlight will have an impact Next we measure Measuring Weighing in Roughly 6400 Before the experiment the mattress and blanket weighed 6300 grams An increase of 100 grams Half a cup of water The mattress and blanket in his room weighed about the same We're one step closer to proving our hypothesis So the killer is familiar with handling liquid nitrogen Tojima-ya Foods, Fresh Frozen Food We have a warrant to search your factory What's going on? Close the door! Sorry Is this the liquid nitrogen you use? Camera, please Do you keep records of usage? Like I said, what's going on? Just confirming something We searched Tojima-ya Foods On the day before Hasunuma's death the liquid nitrogen in the tank was short 20 liters The same amount used in the experiment We also have footage of Shusaku Tojima leaving in a van on the day of the murder But he's at the singing contest 10 minutes later, as he stated The site of the singing contest and the scene of the crime are 3 km apart With the parade it would be impossible to get there and back in 10 minutes, even by car Kusanagi Tojima didn't deliver the liquid nitrogen He handed it over to someone else So he didn't act alone Go over the security camera footage again Yes, sir! Two days later I'm back... Don't change in here We checked all the spectators and traffic on the video footage but we don't know who or how the liquid nitrogen was delivered Are you asking me to guess? It has nothing to do with physics We're missing something It's here -Good -The measurements are good Would you like my advice? Did you check it? Yes, please! It didn't work at all Neither did the IV. Try lowering it by 3 degrees Yeah Try adjusting the suction, not the temperature Drop it by one digit Change your perspective I'm talking to you, Utsumi My perspective? Anything less obvious? It's important -What? -Nothing What is it? It's about the liquid nitrogen. But it's probably nothing Tell me No, no, no -Now I'm really curious -It's embarrassing Embarrassing? You? Now? OK, OK... The huge frog in the parade It's full of helium gas, right? What if after the parade the gas was siphoned off and taken to the scene of the crime? Then maybe your original hypothesis would work... Forget it. It was liquid nitrogen, not helium gas. Sorry Interesting You said you checked the video footage of all the spectators But what about the performers? It's all here Excuse us The props for the parade The treasure chest? First tell me what you're looking for We can't just yet Then I don't have to answer either Perjury is a crime, but what about silence? The crime of silence? The police think Hasunuma was murdered Even so, he got what he deserved Why should I cooperate in your search? We believe Hasunuma's death and Saori Namiki's death are connected somehow This investigation could reveal a vital clue in Saori's case Please help us Thank you Excuse us Mr. Kusanagi What's this? They put plastic bottles inside for stabilization This was on the local school's security cam footage The time is 3:20 PM This is you, Mr. Takagaki What were you carrying? The parade ends at the school Were you carrying the contents of the treasure box for Team Kikuno? You were dating Saori Namiki Her sister Natsumi told us that Saori was so happy to have a boyfriend No You're wrong How so? I think I'll quit singing Quit singing? Why, Saori? What's wrong? What happened? The most important thing for me is to be with you Me, too But you don't have to quit singing Nervous about your debut? No Time for your lesson Saori OK. See you Bye That was my last conversation with Saori Why didn't I listen to her? Saori was trying to tell me something Did you hate Kanichi Hasunuma? Did you want to get revenge? No! That wasn't my intention That wasn't part of the plan Plan? So there was a plan What were you carrying Mr. Takagaki? A tank...of liquid nitrogen And? A van was parked nearby for me to take the tank to Hasanuma's place And? I didn't kill him! I didn't think he'd die... We just wanted to punish him Punish him? Who came up with the plan? He got what he deserved If the truth were to hurt someone would the police protect that person? We don't want anybody else to get hurt So don't ask me that Who gave the order? If he says so, maybe it's true You should be quite familiar with the danger of liquid nitrogen Did you intend to kill Hasunuma from the start? Why would I? The Namiki family is very special to you Yes, Yutaro is my best friend Best friend? You were very fond of Saori as well I even changed her diapers I know how you feel about Hasunuma We were also frustrated we couldn't charge him No! You can't possibly compare your frustration with ours Not even close. It's on a different level Can we document your statement for the record? Go ahead I'll spew all the hateful words you want to hear Tell us what the hatred made you do I'll leave it to your imagination Even if Hasunuma is a sadistic killer who deserves to die murder is still a crime Only the law can punish him But it didn't The law didn't punish him There wasn't even a trial I don't believe in the police I stopped believing Because of whom? You all The police Chief! So we meet again How's the investigation going? Any leads? No answers yet Is Saori Namiki's family involved somehow? I said no answers! Whoa! What's wrong with you? You OK, Chief? So you don't think Tojima can be the murderer Takagaki, either So there were others involved Maybe more than one or two Many people in this town hated Hasunuma Who put the tank in the treasure chest? And who carried out the murder? The Namikis have alibis Takagaki and Tojima are also unlikely That leaves... Team Kikuno's leader, Maya Miyazawa And the couple who wanted Saori to make her singing debut The Niikura Hasunuma has another victim. Yuna Motohashi Case dismissed. The accused is not guilty. That was 15 years ago You think they're connected? This is a complex puzzle And the last piece that completes the puzzle exists in the past The last piece In the past... Look up! On the roof! He's on the roof! We don't think you killed Hasunuma But it couldn't have happened without your help You're the only one who could make him take those sleeping pills or take the lock off his door And... You also have a reason to hate Kanichi Hasunuma Yuna Motohashi's murder 15 years ago When Yuna was found as a corpse her mother Yumiko was devastated She took her own life You raised her as if she were your own daughter Yumiko was your only sister I don't have a sister We know she's not listed on your family register But here's your mother's record You and Yumiko Motohashi were 9 years apart Your sister from a different father I don't have a sister We'll return it later Thank you Excuse us. Be careful -Anything? -Nothing yet Nothing turned up at Masumura's work or residence No connection between Yumiko Motohashi or Yuna He got rid of all the evidence Letters, photos It's all about revenge He's obsessed But if Masumura, our last piece, isn't the killer... Let's go back... to Yutaro Namiki Sorry, we're closed... It's Yukawa What? I'll be right back Temporarily closed, sorry for the inconvenience It's hot today The police are making steady progress They know several people were involved in the crime Takagaki only did what Tojima requested But Tojima wouldn't plan anything without your knowledge I don't understand Professor How about a drink? No, thank you We have watermelon There's no way you're in the dark about this It's natural to assume you were involved from the start Let's close for today Sorry, we're... My name is Eiji Masumura Are you aware that Kanichi Hasunuma killed before and got away with it? I just want to know the truth, Shusaku What should we do? What if Hasunuma admits to killing Saori? Then... I'll call the police Can you do it? Can you really shut off the valve, Yutaro? The original plan was for you to go to Hasunuma's place But an accident occurred On the day of the parade a customer complained of stomach pain Oww... What's wrong, miss? My stomach... Are you OK? Dad! Dad! Come quick! -What? -Her stomach hurts Are you OK? -Are you OK? -I don't know... Call an ambulance! Can you move? Wait! The parade! There may be traffic Look after her. I'll get the car! I'll be back soon This was unexpected You made the difficult decision to take her to the hospital You had to call off the plan So who killed Hasunuma in your place? Professor I have nothing to say If I talk I could never face all those who are remaining silent Excuse me Hello? Mr. Namiki Naoki Niikura turned himself in He claims that he killed Kanichi Hasunuma Mr. Tojima told me Namiki would lock Hasunuma in his room and threaten him Make him confess to Saori's kidnapping and murder Not kill him That's why I went along with it I couldn't tell anyone Not even my wife Who was to threaten Hasunuma? Mr. Namiki And what was your role? My role was... Before the parade... Be very cautious with this If you touch it, it'll burn you I would take the tank of liquid nitrogen... Thanks for coming! Thank you! What great weather! ...to the starting point of parade and place it in Team Kikuno's treasure chest But... when the parade was over I got a call from Tojima It's off? Yutaro had to take a customer to the hospital But the liquid nitrogen... Someone has to pick it up I will There's time before I have to judge the singing contest The box of liquid nitrogen was sitting outside the office That's when I changed my mind For a childless couple like us, Saori was... like a real daughter So precious... She was our dream But... That man... It was my only chance to make him confess I knew Hasunuma woke up when he heard the noise I heard him scream He was panicking I yelled Did you kill Saori? I demanded Tell the truth if you don't want to die! Hasunuma said he just happened to see Saori walking alone that night You mean...he confessed? Yes He followed her in his car and dragged her into Kikuno Children's Park Kikuno Children's Park And? He tried to rape her but she fought back... So he killed her Then... I realized... Hasunuma was dead I'm sorry! No need to apologize Hasunuma finally confessed to the crime That's a good thing He deserved to die Saori... He deserved it, Professor Niikura Saori... Saori! I'm sorry! Why did you have to kill him? Why...? The suspect turned himself in We arrested him for manslaughter Name: Naoki Niikura, male, age 56 More details to follow How is Niikura connected? Was Yutaro Namiki involved? That's all we have for now -Why did Niikura turn himself in? -That's it for today -Who else is involved? -What about the vendetta? -We want more details! -That's it for today! -We have more questions! -Refer them to PR You're charging him on that story? Story? What do you mean? What about Hasunuma? Hasunuma... Can't be charged for Saori Namiki's murder because he's dead -That's right -Yukawa You believe that, Kusanagi? Niikura, Tojima and Yutaro Namiki will pay for their part in it But Hasunuma's death was an accident So you're relieved that their crime is minimized Professor Yukawa You're relieved it's over It was the only way Kusanagi Not another word The case was solved It's not the best outcome, but... the rest is for the courts to decide That's based on the premise that Naoki Niikura's confession was true There's no reason to doubt it None? You think a guy like Hasunuma would confess to murder so easily? Well... I'm sure Kusanagi knows something is off But Niikura... Don't get too close The magnetic field will ruin your watch Niikura got a key piece of information out of Hasunuma: Kikuno Park He took Saori to that park Witnesses testified that around the time of Saori's disappearance they heard women arguing near the park and the sound of something hitting the ground That backs up Niikura's statement But what if... Naoki Niikura already knew about that key piece of information? What do you mean? This man killed my sister! Dead? Professor Yukawa! Kikuno Park Monument construction begins At this point, Hasunuma was still asleep, right? Go on Utsumi speaking Check something for me But don't tell Kusanagi And don't ask me why I need this information These are my conditions. Will you do it? Professor Yukawa Hasunuma is a monster who taunted the police He didn't waver one bit when interrogated about Saori He maintained his composure and silence to the very end Even when presented with irrefutable evidence Why? Because he didn't kill Saori He knew who did The true culprit killed Saori, then left the scene Hasunuma took her body to his parents' house in Shizuoka The real killer must have been shaken Where did the body go? Hasunuma left Kikuno and waited for 3 years until the statute of limitations for abandoning a body expired 3 years later, he made his move His first move was to bring Saori's murder out into the open Hasunuma burned down his house He held onto his clothes tainted with Saori Namiki's blood so he would be arrested He was sending a message to the true killer A message saying, “I know what you've done”. When he was set free he contacted the real killer It was you, Rumi Niikura When Hasunuma appeared at the restaurant you knew who he was Who is that? No idea This man... This man killed my sister! More tea? Please have it while I tell you my side of the story Of course I don't want to be a singer anymore I'm tired of singing. I'm sorry What are you talking about, Saori? What about your debut? I'm really sorry! Tomo talked you out of it I know you two are dating Did he tell you to quit? No! Tomo is supportive Then, why? I'm pregnant I'm going to marry Tomo So I can't sing anymore... Saori... I'm so grateful to Professor Niikura -And to you, of course -No! You can't do this! I'm going to be a mother... What about Professor Niikura's dream? His dream... He bet everything on you, Saori! Fine. I'll tell Professor Niikura myself -I'll apologize -Wait! Please! I knew you wouldn't understand! You're jealous of me! Jealous? You couldn't become a singer... You resent me because Professor Niikura invested so much in me I'm sick of his dreams and your jealousy! You're like stalkers! Don't talk to me like that! Saori? Saori? She didn't remember what happened after that When she came to she was trying to jump off a bridge She tried to take her own life But a siren brought her back to her senses Saori... She went back to the park but it was still, as if nothing had happened Niikura residence I won't tell anyone about what I saw that night On one condition Who are you? Who am I? He asked for 1 million yen No way it would end there That's right But she had to pay him The continuous threats must have been unbearable Then her husband shocked her with the confession of Yutaro Namiki and Shusaku Tojima's plan On the day of the parade they would force Hasunuma to tell them the truth She had no choice but to tell him everything I'm sorry! That she was the one who killed Saori I'll turn myself in! -No -To the police! No! No! Calm down I'll protect you I knew how you felt But I pretended not to notice Do you have a CD? I'd love to hear it Oh, no. I never made a debut Didn't have the talent Was Professor Niikura your teacher too? Yes, he was I never thought we'd get married, though Saori, break's over A forbidden love between a teacher and his student Enough chit-chat. Back to work! I... I made you... suffer! Naoki Niikura resolved to kill Kanichi Hasunuma Roll call. Prisoner #10 #16 If he inserted himself in Tojima's plan and if he, not Namiki went to Hasunuma's place, he could kill him On the day of the parade the lady who got sick at the restaurant was hired by Niikura Hired? Yutaro Namiki had to take her to the hospital Tojima decided to call off the plan He asked Naoki Niikura to retrieve the liquid nitrogen Hasunuma took the sleeping pills that Eiji Masumura gave him The lock on the door was removed There was no reason for Naoki Niikura to hesitate Rumi! Rumi! Quiet! Does Mr. Kusanagi know? Not yet We have to tell him! Wait There's more Professor Yukawa... You came here to convince me to turn myself in That was my intention But I still haven't gotten to the truth There may be something critical that even you don't know about Something critical? When did she bleed? When? You decided to arrest Hasunuma when you found Saori's blood on his work clothes That's right According to the matter you investigated for me the police searched Kikuno Park when Saori disappeared But there's no record of blood at the scene So she wasn't bleeding when Hasunuma moved her? What if Saori regained consciousness while he was driving to Shizuoka? His scheme would be ruined What would he do? No... The gash in her skull Hasunuma hit her in the back of the head and killed her Check her barrette Barrette? The one Saori always wore After Saori disappeared Rumi found her barrette at the park She's still holding onto it If there's no blood on the barrette the fatal blow didn't take place at the park... I want to talk to Kusanagi If Naoki Niikura was lying... I didn't understand why Is that... really the truth? I'm not sure yet You should check the barrette If my hypothesis is correct you should let Naoki Niikura know He'll have to decide whether or not to tell the truth If Kanichi Hasunuma was the one who ultimately killed Saori Namiki his wife will be saved But his own crime would no longer be manslaughter He would be charged with first degree murder That's right Naoki Niikura may remain silent Same goes for Rumi Niikura She may not tell the police what she told you That's all I can do A string of cases that started 15 years ago... So many people were involved and suffered... No They're still suffering Including you Only the people who suffered can put an end to this Detective Can this be happening? But it didn't No! Not even close It's on a different level Perjury is a crime but what about silence? If the truth were to hurt someone would the police protect that person? Leave us alone The barrette... had no traces of blood on it Saori Namiki's killer wasn't Rumi Niikura Kanichi Hasunuma is highly likely to be the one Of course it won't be easy to prove But... If you break your silence and tell us the real reason why you killed Hasunuma Rumi will be relieved of the burden of concealing a crime she didn't commit I promise you The police will prove it was Hasunuma that killed Saori Namiki! Mr. Niikura Will you remain silent? Naoki Niikura's charge was elevated to murder He admitted to killing Hasunuma with intent Rumi Niikura will be charged with assault What about the others? Eiji Masumura's charge for aiding abetting a murder is pending He's no longer in Kikuno Thank you What are you doing? Hurry up! They considered charging Yutaro Namiki with accomplice to murder but decided against it Dad Same for his wife Machiko Temporarily closed, Sorry for the inconvenience Namikiya Party of 3 tonight? There's a flower shop Turn right! Shusaku Tojima who prepared the liquid nitrogen didn't know what Naoki Niikura was going to do with it Neither he nor Tomoya Takagaki will be charged Go ahead Stop dancing. Watch where you're going! Go ahead and cross! Maya Miyazawa wasn't involved in the crime so she won't be charged Hey -Come in, Shu! -The usual! How's Kusanagi? Mr. Kusanagi... is working I see I think... What? He's grateful to his best friend Is that so?
