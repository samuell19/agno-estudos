I want to thank you all for being here. I'd like to start by sharing a very traumatic experience that affected me as a child. When I was five years old, I lost my father to a degenerative spinal injury. While my father's illness ended his life, it, ironically, was the catalyst for me to truly start my own. I vowed to spend my life finding a solution. - Move. - Hey, what's wrong with you? Fucking dog. Jesus, Cam, you look like shit. Come on inside. Some of us don't get ten hours a night, Mort. - How was that vacation? - I wouldn't call it that. And how are things with the wife? Don't ask. Where's the big boss? Cam! You know, I didn't hire the baddest motherfucker on the planet to protect me just to have him disappear. Don't like it when you're not around. Yeah, it's because a lot of people want to kill you, Leor. This fucking guy. - I love you, Cam. - Leor, what time is it? It's a... Oh, shit, I forgot my watch. See? No more vacations for you. Margaret! Margaret, darling. Bring my watch, the Poirier. The gold one, not the stainless. - Thanks for babysitting. - No problem. It's literally babysitting, though. Yeah, good days, bad days. Speaking of that, how's the shoulder? I'll live. Not much longer you keep playing hero. Someone's got to do it. This is team leader. I have visuals on the target building. No signs of enemy. Status, team leader? Apache One, moving to Ridge Point. Clear. Chief, what's going on? Where the fuck is everyone? I don't like it either. Stay on mission, move up. The amazing thing about this project is, it's never been done before. Never even been attempted, because the technology hasn't kept up. But my company has been on the forefront of this. And now, I would like to introduce you to our first successful operation. Our patient zero, if you will. This is Roger. His arm was lost in an IED explosion that almost killed him. We were able to successfully fuse a Phoenix biotech arm that actually functions now by use of Roger's central nervous system. This technology isn't just for military application, it's also for civilians of all walks of life... Children who can't walk, can't hug their parents. And in the future, we can go even farther. All this coming from a man who's had multiple attempts on his life. In the most recent attempt, your head of security was shot and he almost lost his life. So, how do you stay so optimistic? We can only realize our true potential through adversity. That's why I call my company The Phoenix Group. We rise up through the ashes. You're just in time, Leor. John, I fucking love this guy. Always ready to get the party started. Look at that. I believe we all have a responsibility for the well-being of our fellow man. They're so blown away by technology I developed like a decade ago. So archaic compared to our new project. Well, we need to run a successful test to prove that it works. Yes, John, all right. We've had some teething problems but I think we're close. I think we just need the right test subject. Well, the good news is, we may have a few subjects that just might fit the bill. - Then here's to success. - Success. The amazing thing about this project is, it's never been done before. Never even been attempted because the technology hasn't kept up. But my company has been on the forefront of this. What do you think of your critics who accuse you of playing God? Hello, this is Michelle. I can't come to the phone right now, you know what to do. Yeah, it's me. I tried you a couple of times, uh, can't get ahold of you. I got some paperwork from the lawyer. I think we should talk. Call me when you get a chance. His vitals are weak. We're probably gonna lose him. No. No, not if I can help it. Everyone, out. I will now engage the sonic scanner to activate the nanites. Status team leader. Where the fuck is everyone? Stay on mission. Hostage is confirmed, the target's linked. No! No! No! Doctor, it's working. As you can see, he's doing just fine. We are going to have to keep him sedated a little while longer to monitor his progress and check on any abnormalities. Look, I don't want to be a wet blanket, but all I see is a soldier that was almost dead who is now stable. Nothing miraculous about that. We need to run more tests to make sure that these micromachines are working and responding. By all indications, the longer these nanites stay in him, the quicker he's going to recover. This isn't project Band-Aid. We call it Invincible for a reason. When will the test start? Now is as good time as any. Jesus Christ. Relax. You call that a test? What the fuck, Michelle? Red alert, code one. Red alert, code one. Everything's gonna be okay. Calm down. No. No, no. No! Hold your fire, dammit! Hold your fire! I know you. What the hell happened? Anyone? It's as unpredictable as... Don't give me none of that ass-covering scientific bullshit. Do you have any idea what kind of position this puts us in? You wanted invincible. Oh, lady, you're here because you tagged along with the old regime, so if you wanna keep your job, keep your fucking mouth shut. I just heard. This is crazy! This is just crazy! Why wasn't he contained? At least until we could understand what was going to happen. This is experimental work. He showed no sign of temperamental change. Everything was normal: His heart, brain function, normal. That is definitely not normal. We're still at the infancy stage of this program. We don't know what these machines can do to the brain. They could be suppressing, agitating his thoughts, his emotion, his memories. It's possible that the dosage that he received may wear off soon and he'll return to normal. But we haven't even completed the test with human subjects yet. Until then, we don't know how long each dose lasts. We need to get him back to run more tests. We've got a highly trained soldier pumped up on some super-juice, and we don't know where the fuck he is or what he's doing. And from the looks of what happened here earlier, it'll probably be a fucking mess. So, yes, I'd say we need to get him back. I just don't know what the fuck went wrong. I mean, the technology was all... Oh, fuck. This is a mess, Cam. Relax. I'll take care of it. I've got an old friend who lives here. - He's a detective. - Police? Don't worry, he's a friend. What's more important is, we've got to get you out of here. I told you, killing monkeys is one thing. It's fucked up, but this is on another level. If the press finds out, if anyone finds out about this black site, they'll bury you. I'm putting you on a plane back to L.A. I'll have Mort pick you up at the airport. No. I have to stay. I have to find out what the fuck went wrong. Leor, you pay me to protect you. Let me do my job. My clothes are at the hotel. Car. Now. Ever the hero. You would know. You've been surrounded by them your whole career. You were a hell of a soldier. Look at you now. A burned out contractor looking for answers in the bottom of a glass. You're still just a high-ranking coward. Playing dice with other people's lives. Fine, but here we are. He's on the way. Black-out the press, keep the house locked down. No, don't worry, I'll lock 'im down. Put a lid on it. The world is shut out. I'll call you later. Cam? - Hey, man. - Thanks for coming. No problem, man. Always... Always ready to help a brother. You know I'm down. How's Michelle? She's okay. She's still, like, living and working the same spots, but... Wait, I thought this was about business. Yeah, right, business. - Let's get some coffee. - Sounds good. You look great, by the way. Everybody's got a different opinion. Everything I'm about to tell you is vaulted. Okay, got it. Vaulted. Leor is funding a black site. It's why we're down here. It went south last night. Oh, fuck, man! Black project? Oh, fuck, Cam, you know better not to fuck with that shit. Come on. Yeah, my judgement's been pretty impaired lately. Taylor's running it. That asshole? Yeah. One of the test subjects escaped last night. Okay. This guy, he doesn't happen to be 6'2", 350 pounds, wrecking everything in his path now, does he? Sounds like my guy. He tore through a check-point, two beat cops, man. We got ties to special police mobilizing right now, man. Yeah, that's not gonna be enough. Come with me, I want to show you something. This is all the shit you got? Hey, asshole, back off. Get the fuck back or I'll put you down like a fucking dog. - Don't. - You're dead. The keys. You know what, man? I get the feeling there's more to this than you're telling me. If you don't tell me what the fuck's going on, then how the fuck am I supposed to help you? You know Leor's company, The Phoenix Group? Yeah. They do good work with the guys coming back fucked up from the war. Limbs, spinal reconstruction... They do good work. I know all that, yeah. But go on. Taylor got Leor wrapped around his finger talking about the future, telling him what could be achieved with this technology. Yeah? I saw something last night. Something incredible. The bodies are still here. The drugs, still here. The money's still here. This is almost pretty incredible, man. Hey, hey, no, no, no. Sir, stop! Sir, what are you doing? Sir, that's not your food! What the fuck you doing? Turn that back on. You gotta be fucking kidding me, man. - Put it back on. - No, man. It's been fucking over a year, man. Get her damn out of your fucking head. Pretz, don't be an asshole. Turn it back on. No, that's not gonna happen. I'm not gonna turn it back on. Turn it back on before we both do something we regret. Yeah. There's already too many goddamn regrets. I guess this shit you take's got you making bad decisions every day. - Ah, fuck. - Yeah, hit me. - I'm sorry. - No, no, no, no, no. Hit me. No, no, no. Hit-hit me again. - I'm sorry. - Come on, hit me again. - I'm sorry. - Hit me again. She was afraid, all right? She was afraid you were gonna die, all right? And there was nothing you could've done would've made her stay. You chose your path, right? You made yourself into a bullet magnet for the OR. It's too fucking dangerous to be around you, man. Accept that and get the fuck on with your fucking life. And what if I don't want to be that anymore? Well, fucking change. People change, bro. But you got to let Michelle go. You got to move on, man. I don't know how. I know. Dang, come on. Listen, somehow it's gonna... it's gonna work itself out. You know, you're gonna be all right, right? Shall we? Let's go. Okay. How you doing, okay? - Yeah. - Okay. - Fine. - What happened here? Um, big foreign guy, uh, started taking everybody's food, eating it. - Ye... yeah. - Yeah. Um, I don't know where... Which-which way do you think he went? Uh, everyone told me he went that way. - Knocked me out pretty bad. - Yeah, all right. Thank you. Thanks. Yeah. I'm here to help you. This is over. Cam! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hang in there. You're gonna be okay. - Help's coming. What? - My back. I can't feel my legs. I can't feel my legs. Tell Michelle... Of course... Rest easy. Michelle... Chief, what's going on? Where the fuck is everyone? Stay on mission. I appreciate you coming. Ah... Cut the bullshit, Taylor. How much has Cam told you? He told me you're still an asshole. You got my friend killed, man. He's alive. - Technically. - What do you mean? I don't know what the hell you mean he's still alive. What I'm about to tell you is top-secret, so you need to keep your mouth shut. We're running a very special program here. Using Teska's designs, we've developed a counteragent using microscopic machines. Okay, then... This big guy... the big guy then... What is he, just a guinea pig or...? He was wounded, critically. Clinging to life, no family, perfect prototype. - We saved his life. - Yeah, convenient. So how do we stop him? It's a bit complicated. Let me explain. Originally, we created an antidote, a neutralizer, but it seems that in the past 24 hours, we've seen that the micromachines are able to convince the body's immune defense to fight the antidote. So what happens, these machines? They stay inside of them forever? Well, we're not sure. We took samples from subject Brock, and we're now seeing that this subject's cellular structure and machine are becoming one. This will potentially give the subject the effects indefinitely. Indefinitely. Okay, how do we kill him? We don't. We don't want to damage him. We'd like to retrieve the subject and figure out what went wrong, fix it. In retrospect, the subject Brock is showing signs of stress. - You call that stress? - Yes. Brought on by a massive amount of shock and trauma. Something he probably endured before this procedure. Although this situation could have exasperated the issue, causing this delusional state. But I think that Brock is still mentally in combat. I mean, this would not be the same with everyone. Wait a second... Nah, nah, nah, nah. You're not... You're not putting that shit into Cam. You want your friend to live, right? I mean, really live. Not just frozen, because that's exactly what he's going to be. Catatonic. He's had extensive damage to spine, internal organs. The severity of his head injuries alone, it's... You want him to live, don't you? What do you think he'll say if we had the opportunity to save him, make him walk, and you tried to stop it? Putting Cam through this procedure may be our only hope in stopping Brock. You see, I fucking knew it. You guys are doing this to save your fucking own asses. You don't give a fuck about Cam. Question is, do you? I don't know. What do you think I should do, Mort? Geez, I don't know what to tell you. How bad is it? He's fucked up, man. What do you think? You think... You think I can trust Teska? Truth be told, Teska is a little out there, but he's really trying to help the whole world with this technology. Now, Cam genuinely loves this guy. He's risked his life for him on multiple occasions. What more can I say than that? Can you put Teska on the phone? Let me check. - Leor! - Yes, Trevor. I've got Cam's partner in Thailand on the phone, Pretz. - Says he needs to talk to you. - Well, come in. Come on, then. What's happened? Where's Cam? So, we were trying to... take down the guy, you know, the-the big guy, you know, Brock. He beat the hell out of Cam. Threw him off from really high onto concrete and... How can I help? This doctor and, um... and Colonel Taylor, now-now... They wanna... they wanna shoot him up with this, like... you know, like a nanotech shit. - But... - But what? Look what happened to this guy Brock, okay? How do I know the same won't happen to Cam? Truth is, we don't know. I've had more failures than successes in this life, but if you're not failing, you're not innovating. What I can tell you is, with all my heart, I care about the people closest to me, and that includes Cam. Why do you even mess with this military bullshit? Yes, military tech is a gray area. But what if my advancements can help the military, the police, firefighters do their jobs? Protect us without the fear of death? Isn't that a good thing? And what if this technology gets into the wrong hands, huh? What, like guns and bombs? Anything is dangerous in the wrong hands. A.I. is next and there's no stopping that. Listen... If Cam really is in such bad condition, we may be the only option he has. Okay, all right. Thank you. I like the Phoenix. Leave me alone. We were able to successfully fuse a Phoenix biotech arm that actually functions now by use of Roger's central nervous system. This technology isn't just for military application, it's also for civilians of all walks of life. You're actually watching this shit? Fuck, Cam. You're awake, man. You're awake. Yeah, you covered that. You-you've been asleep a long time, man. We didn't think you were going to make it, you know? What happened? I can't remember. You're gonna be all right. You're gonna be all right. - I was hurt. - Yeah. My legs. I can feel my legs. As you may have guessed, young man, you've been out for a while. - How do you feel? - Hungry. Well, that's understandable. - When can I get up? - No, no, no. We need the sedatives to wear off a little. You should be able to move around whenever you like. Do you have any other questions? - Yeah, when's dinner? - A nurse will bring you something in a little bit. Nice to see you again. I gotta talk to Michelle. Ah, Cam, come on. - She-she-she doesn't... - Doesn't what? Doesn't love me? - Bullshit. - Maybe you're right. You know, maybe... maybe you should talk to her. Maybe you should tell her yourself, you know? Hey, thanks for being there for me, bro. Any time, man. Any time. Get me the fuck out of here before that doctor comes back in. What do you want? Give me all the fish. Give me your money. Hey, hey. Oh, hey... Call me if you ever need anything, all right? Yeah. Asshole. Cam? It's good to see you. You mind if I come in? I don't think it's a good idea. Please. I need to talk to you. All right, make it quick. Um, you want anything to drink? I don't have any whiskey. Is beer okay for you? Water's fine. Water? Since when you start drinking water? Stop staring at my ass. Thanks. So, what do you want to talk about? Is it about the divorce papers? Tell you the truth, I didn't open the envelope. This can't be what you want. - Everything is done... - No. Just listen to what I have to say. Okay? Before you kick me out. Please, it's important. I don't like the sound of this. I'm back, working in Asia again. I know. You've made quite a name for yourself. Getting shot for... What's his name? Leor? No, no. I thought about everything. My life, us, the past. I want things to be different. I want to be different. I want to be different for you. Yeah? Why the sudden change? Why now, after I serve you the divorce papers? It's been a year, Cam. I guess I just lost track of time. What you do is too dangerous. You make bad decisions. I want peace in my life. I almost didn't make it this time. This is not the first time you almost got killed. And I'm sure it won't be the last. This is... This is different. It scared me. I was afraid. I was afraid I'd lose you. I thought I wouldn't get the chance to tell you how I feel. What are you trying to do? Just tell you I still love you. I will always love you. I'm sorry you were hurt. I'm sorry for a lot of things. But I'm not sorry I left. This is the best for both of us. It was good to see you, Michelle. What'd you do to me? I assume you know the penalty for trespassing? What the fuck did you do to me? Relax. I know why you're here. Answer my question. What the fuck did you do to me? I saved your life. I gave you a second chance at life. You put that shit in me. Well, you're the hero, right? - So go... - I'm not your fucking hero. - So go be the hero. - I'm not your fucking hero, and I'm not one of your fucking soldiers anymore! You're right, but you're the only one that can stop that thing right now. What? I'm thinking. About? About how I'm going to kick your ass when all this is over. Did you know? Know what? Don't fucking play dumb with me. Did you know? Did you know Taylor pumped me full of that shit? Come here, come here. You were almost dead, bro. All right? You were almost dead. Now, your spine was shattered. All right, there... there was nothing I could do. It's all right. Just wanted to know if you knew. You were dying. I did not want to lose you. I would have done the same thing for you. You fucking superhero. Yeah, you're a super asshole. Get off of me. Something's going down at the docks. I'm not sure yet. Wait... Okay, he thinks it's... He thinks it's Brock. - Give me a second. - Yeah, okay. - Who's this? - Hey, it's me. - Is this a bad time? - No. No. Not at all. Is this about the other night? No, I'm just ha... having a situation here at work. So you're not turning me down. Don't you change your mind? Never. Uh... yeah, forget about... forget about the other night. Maybe I can... Maybe I can come by later and we can talk. Cam, I don't want you... No, no, no, no, no. Nothing like that. - Just talk. I just wanna talk. - No. I don't... - I don't want you to think I'm... - No, I just want to talk. All right, I'll see you later. Bye. Yo, Cam. How you feeling, man? - How do I feel? - Yeah. - What are you thinking? - What? - What are you thinking? - What? Spit it out. Well, you think you're gonna go crazy and shit like that? I hope not. This is fucked, man. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Yeah, a big, fucking angry needle. Let's go check over here. Are you okay? Oh, yes. Thank you. Put some lotion in the basket. You scared the hell out of me. - You got a car? - Yeah, I got Pretz's truck. I didn't know if you were gonna still be here, but you got a minute? You wanna talk? - You stay at the hotel? - Yeah. Okay. How was it tonight? - It was good. - Good? - Yeah. - A lot of people? Yeah, a lot of people. So, what you want to talk about? First of all, I'm sorry about the other night. I shouldn't have acted like that. Just had a tough night. I like that side of you. Remember when we met? Yeah. When I was performing at your big corporate party. Yeah. Well, the reason why Leor was here in Thailand... There's a project to help people heal. Just give me a second. Hello. Is everything okay? Michelle. Michelle, just give me a second. No, it's fine. We've been all over and haven't seen a goddamn thing. He'll be around here. I know it. My feet would rather be someplace else. Maybe if you cleaned up, you wouldn't feel like shit. Yeah, but... but I don't got the same juice running through my veins the way you do, man. - It's him. Call it in. - Right, right, right. Cam, wait! You shouldn't have come back. Let it go. I can't. You won't stop me. We don't have to do this. Come back with me. We can figure this out. There is nothing to figure out. What happened to you? You seemed like a good soldier. Come back with me. They can fix you. It's too late. Hey, hey. - You okay? - I'm fine. Get off of me. - Where did he go? - He's gone. What happened with the gunshot victims? They didn't make it. Hold on a second. You've been shot, man. This shit really works. Maybe you should see a doctor, huh? Everything's normal. Your body is adapting to the nanotech very well. Okay, so, um... so, is he gonna be like this forever? He may need some booster shots to keep at peak performance, but as far as we can tell at this point, um, he's gonna remain like this indefinitely. Indefinitely. Sounds horrible. Well, there is one thing to avoid for sure: fire. If the tissue has burned away, say, 40% or more, then there isn't enough to rebuild from. It worked with test monkeys. Cam. Cam, Cam! Cam! - Cam... - What is it? We've gotta get to the lab, man. It's serious. All right, give me a minute, I'll get dressed. Hey. Hey, Cortez. Did Taylor tell you what I did? You here to turn yourself in? I need more of that stuff. Where is it? It's... We keep it in the test chambers. Walk. - I want the guns. - Okay. Put them down. Come on, we both want this project to succeed, for you to stay alive and for me to see it come to fruition. You don't know what I want, so give me the juice. Yeah. Colonel Taylor, we're under attack. - Brock? - Yes. It's him. - I'm 15 out. - Get your ass over here and take care of it. Bitch. You came back. This is what you want? Shit. Hey, babe. Cam, I've called you a couple of times. Why haven't you answered the phone? Oh, I'm just having a little issue at work. Can I call you back? I'm just... I'm performing at Club Red tonight and you haven't seen me sing in a while, so I thought you might want to come and watch. Yeah, okay. I... I'll call you back. You won't stop me. Now! You piece of shit. - What? - You set him up. Him and his men. Fucking mission was bullshit. - There were no hostages. - That's classified information. You don't know what you're doing. He didn't volunteer. You set him up. You sent that poor bastard into an ambush. You picked up the pieces and made a fucking monster. And now you're one too. No! No! No! No, don't! No! No! - Hello, this is Michelle... - Motherfuck. - What? - Straight to voicemail. - Maybe she's on stage, huh? - No. I got a bad feeling. Just go to the club. - What's he saying? - A lot of people got hurt, a lot of people got injured and... the singer got taken, all right? Singer, female? - Female singer? - Yeah. Okay. It's Michelle. Let me go. Untie me. Don't worry. I just need you until I get what I need. Wait until Cam gets ahold of you. - Michelle... - It's me. Well, you're dead, motherfucker. You hear me? You crossed the line. You took my girl, I tried to fucking help you. I won't hurt her if you do what I say. Riverwalk building by the docks. Twenty minutes. Okay, so what's the plan? Save Michelle. Just in case. Should we call for back-up? No. No one else needs to die. Just me and him. Cam! Cam. You okay? Do you have it? Right here. All you gotta do is let her go. Give them to me. Give me them, I'll let her go. They're right here. All you gotta do is let her go. We had a deal. Run. Go now. Just you and me now. That's right. You okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm okay. - Cam is on the top, go help him. - Okay. Give me the fucking vial. Give me the fucking vial. No! - You'll kill us both. - Maybe it's better that way. Why? Why did you do it? Why? My men! Some of my men are still alive. I have to go back and save my men. I have to go back and save them. I have a boat, supplies. I just need the juice so I can have the power to save my men. Help me save my men. It's over. It's over. Cam! - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - You okay? - Yeah. - He didn't hurt you, did he? - No. You know, Brock's guys still might be out there. Yeah, I know. You know we can't let that slide, huh? So, um, what is it that you wanted to tell me? Yeah, so I'm...
