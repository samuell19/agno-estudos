I'm here. Alma. (Moans) Alma, come on. Your hair is brown. Your nose is bigger. (Grunts) (Sighing) Your cheeks are red. Like strawberries. GIRL: That dream again? ALMA: Mmhmm. (Lighter flicking) (Sighing) (Thunder rumbling in distance) Wear that. Come on, we got lot to do today. (Thunder rumbling in distance) (♪♪♪) (Footfalls) ALMA: You do the water, I'll do the lights. GIRL: Yeah. (Thunder rumbling in distance) (♪♪♪) (Water dripping) (Whirring) GIRL: Is it on? (Bang) Yeah! (Grunting) (Pouring) (Footfalls) GIRL: I'm jealous. Why? GIRL: I never dream. They're not dreams, they're nightmares. They're not nice. GIRL: It's happening more and more. Almost every day now. (Girl grunts) ALMA: Mum will be back soon. Yeah, I heard her leave just after dusk. (♪♪♪) ALMA: Can you pass me a hammer and nails? Sometimes I'd like to have nightmares, too. I mean, they're not dreams, but at least they're something. Hmm. Do you reckon this is gonna hold? It'll have to do. (Banging) (Clinking) (Whistle blows in distance) (Footfalls) (Clunking) (Rain pattering) Yeah, she's out there. (Rotating) (Girl grunts) (Rattling) (Clunking) (Footfalls) (Woman sighing) WOMAN: Come on, give me a hand, quick. Did the traps work? Traps were empty. (Woman grunts) I had to go all the way down to the Black River. You okay? Uh, was it safe? WOMAN: I was extremely careful. (Taking deep breaths) Did we get an answer? Nothing. Sorry, Alma. (Taking deep breaths) (Splashing) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (Hoist squeaking) (Slashing) (♪♪♪) (Takes a deep breath) (Knocking) Is everything ready? Mmhmm. WOMAN: Forgive us, Mother, for breaking the sacred bonds that bound us, having sinned in arrogance, making our days as black as night and our nights as pale as an Autumn morning. Thank you, Mother, for giving us everything, even when everything was taken away. So when the sun goes down, you make us one with the night, one with life. (Animal calls in distance) WOMAN: Bless you, Mother, for protecting us against the evil that threatens our borders, giving us the dark to shelter us and the river to guard us. (Fire crackling) (Clinking) I have a present for you. You're coming with me next time. To the hunt? Really? Are you sure? You need to learn. (Sighs) I hope you're ready. We leave three nights before the solstice. Come on, it will be dawn soon. Oh! (Chuckles) (Fire crackling) GIRL: Birch. Uh, oak. Those are easy. (Rattling in background) The Betula mushroom. Ganoderma lingzhi. Ugh, yeah, of course Ganoderma lingzhi. Yes. Known for its curative properties. You should've know that. You were right. WOMAN: Yes, she was right. Mother Nature is your friend. Make sure you know her as well as she knows you. The yellow poppy, the Glaucium flavum. WOMAN: And why must we know this one? Because it's a narcotic. To stun bigger animals, which we'll do on the hunt! Mum, what do we do if we're outside and it's daybreak, and we're far from home? Simply seek shelter. There's plenty by the river, and wait for night to return. Don't worry, Alma. Mum'll be with us, we'll be safe. (Footfalls) (Sighing) I can't wait to see what's out there. ALMA: You know, I actually like it here. What's there to like? Well, there's the sound of the storm outside when we're in. And there's the horrible tiles in the kitchen, and the smell of mould, when mum whistles for us. There's one thing I don't like, though. What? Your feet. (Chuckles) You don't like them? Get off me. GIRL: You don't like them? You don't like-- wait! (Girl laughing) GIRL: You don't like my feet. MUM: Hey, what's going on? Oh! ALMA: Sorry, we're done! (Whispering) You're not finished? Of course not. ALMA: Give it to me. (Rustling) (Scribbling) So much for not liking chemistry. ALMA: (Whispering) Shut up. (Girl chuckles) (Footfalls) (Clinking) (Rustling) Excellent! Mum. Can we have some honey? You already had some the other day. Never enough honey, but always enough disgusting tea. (Shushing) MUM: That's very good. (Gulping) MUM AND ALMA: (Together) ♪ Night time has fallen ♪ ♪ Moon's reached the sky ♪ ♪ Silence around us ♪ ♪ Soon as we rise ♪ ♪ Comforting starlight ♪ ♪ We wonder why ♪ ♪ Mother has whispered ♪ ♪ No need to cry ♪ ♪ Forest's our saviour ♪ ♪ Thin of the night ♪ (Laughing) ♪ Harvest is goodness ♪ ♪ Hide from the light ♪ ♪ Blue from the berries ♪ -(Chuckling) -♪ Red from the roses ♪ ♪ Brighten our lives ♪ ♪ And banish our woes ♪ (Laughing) (Hooting in distance) (♪♪♪) (Scratching in background) Can you pass me the red, please? -GIRL: It's almost done. -Hmm. -Goin' to need some more. (Scratching in background) It's wrong. What is? GIRL: Your painting. Why? I found out that cities had trees. No, they didn't. Men got rid of 'em all. Telling you they did. (Footfalls in distance) (Mum clears throat) Come here. (Footfalls) MUM: Well, before there were trees in the city. But they were just crammed into small, confined spaces. Can you believe that? Now nature's taken everything back. I think we've gained more than we've lost in the end. ALMA: How can you say that when we live like this? Well, you don't realize. Perhaps before we might have had everything, but it didn't make us happy. Come on, we have to check all the traps. (Hooting in distance) (Grunting) (Hooting in distance) ALMA: Where are you going? GIRL: We need more red pigment. ALMA: Oh, yeah. MUM: Hey, how about some help here? Sorry, Mum, Alex was just going to find some plants to make pigment red. You've got to stop following her around. She's a little girl. And you're not anymore. Sorry, Mum, I'll try and be more grown up. (Frogs croaking in distance) When I was your age everything was different. I didn't have the responsibilities you have. (Digging) MUM: Hey, Alma. Yeah? Go on. Go, play with Alex. Are you sure? I mean, I uh-- I can manage. I've been doin' it for years. (Sighing) (Hooting in distance) (Stabs) (Hooting in distance) Alex? (♪♪♪) (Taking deep breaths) ALMA: Alex? (Noise in distance) (Taking deep breaths) (Thump) -ALMA: Oh! -ALEX: Hey. Don't do that, Alex! -ALEX: What's wrong? -You scared me! ALEX: I scared you? I-- I thought you were... It doesn't matter. I found them. (Sighs) We're going to make a great red. Come on. (Water running) ALEX: Are we taking turns, now? Just give me a minute. ALEX: Since when? I'll be out in a second. ALEX: Okay. If Mum finds out we're wasting so much water, I'm not taking the blame. Come on! I'm kidding! I'd never tell on you. Thanks. (Water running in background) (Rattling) ALEX: Two-nil! (Fast footfalls) (Alex grunts) (Popping) -Give me another-- -Two-nil. -Give me another-- -No! Why? No! You stop being a sore loser! Oh, don't like this game anyway. ALEX: Well, it won't be a game when we're in the woods. Here, I'll show you. You've gotta give the stone more thrust. And how do I do that then? Pull. Pull. (Gasps) Oh, shit! It broke. (Sighing) It's okay. I think I might know where there's another one. ALEX: Yeah? Mmhmm. -ALEX: Come on. -Okay. (Grunts) Come on. (Chuckles) (Quick footfalls) (Squeaking) (Whispering) Okay, come on. (Flicks switch) ALMA: Okay, slingshot. Yeah. (Objects clattering) (Clinking) Alma. ALMA: What are you doing? What? Look, it's fantastic. ALMA: We're looking for a slingshot. Yeah. -Hey, Alma. -ALMA: What? -Alma, hey! -ALMA: What? Come here. ALMA: I found it. -ALEX: Alma. -What? Is this a phone? I don't know. Uh, come on, let's go. I found it. Let's go. Hello? (Pressing buttons) Stop acting like a child. Let's go! Two seconds, please. Two seconds, please, please, please! ALMA: I'm leaving the room. I'm leaving. -I'm leaving this room. -ALEX: Two more seconds! ALMA: I'm leaving this room! (Thudding) (Taking deep breaths) (Whispering) Pick it up. Pick it. Alex. Alex. What is that? (Chuckles) Okay, hide it on yourself. -(Chuckling) -Hide it, hide it! (Shushing) (Creaking) (Flicks switch) (Rustling) ALMA: Yeah, not all of it looks comfortable to me. ALEX: No. I don't know why I thought it'd be more simple. What? Like in, out, boom, child! (Chuckling) Oh, no, not quite like that, but... ...all right, you know, simpler. Do you think that... What? Well, Mum? Well, we didn't get out of nowhere, did we? (Laughing) Mm! I can't even... Do you think it was like that? Or maybe that. No. I don't wanna think about it. (Sighs) Do you ever think what it might be like to be with a boy? -Do you? -ALMA: I asked you first. I don't know. Maybe. I mean, yeah. I have thought about it. You? Yeah. Yeah. I-- He's got brown hair, and dark eyebrows, and green eyes. And his lips are thin, small, and he's got-- Got strong arms, and dreamy eyes, mmm. (Chuckling) -Stop. -Mmm, mmm. (Mimics kissing) Stop it! Get away from me. (Laughing) Don't crease it, don't crease it. (Pages rustling) (♪♪♪) (Cutlery clinking) Mother, uh, um... MUM: Yes, Alma? Is everything okay? (Cutlery clinking) MUM: Of course. Why aren't we eating? (Cutlery clinking) MUM: Oh, silly me. (Mum clearing throat) (Footfalls) (Crockery clattering) (Footfalls) You went in the cloakroom. -But we were just-- -MUM: Be quiet! Do you think it's right to lie to your mother? What? I didn't lie. We would've told you. We just went looking for a slingshot. (Mum sighs) I'm not angry, I just need you to be honest. Do you really think there's nothing wrong with going in the cloakroom? I think there's nothing wrong. Do you? I think there's nothing wrong with it. It's not like I'm gonna go in there and drink rat poison, like when I was little. Are we all agreed on this? Yeah. MUM: Very good. So if you think you've done nothing wrong, help yourselves. Well, are you not hungry anymore? (Sighing) MUM: So? (Mum sighs) That's what I thought. (Footfalls and cart rolling) (Crockery clattering in distance) (Footfalls) (♪♪♪) MUM: What are you doing? Nothing, just laundry. Is everything alright? Yeah. ALMA: Um... I better um, get this done. Of course, darling. (Cart rolling) (Thunder rumbling in distance) (Rain pattering) (Thunder rumbling in distance) ALMA: I saw her in the cloakroom. She's just staring into space. She's starting to scare me. ALMA: It's just because she cares about us. No. I saw her in the living room the other day, do the exact same thing. And I wanted to tell you, but it's-- Well, it's just because the hunt's coming. What are you talking about? (Door shutting in distance) (Switch flicks) ALEX: What happened with the plates downstairs is not normal. She's being strange! Come on, Alma! (Footfalls in distance) Goodnight, Alex. Are you serious? Every time I try to talk about her, you shut me out. ALMA: Alex, please. I can't keep my eyes open. Fine! (Rain pattering in distance) Sometimes I don't know what I'm here for. ALMA: Alex. Fine! Goodnight. (Thunder rumbling in distance) (♪♪♪) ALEX: Alma. Alma. (Grunting) Alex? (♪♪♪) (Creaking) Alex? (Creaking) ALEX: Alma! ALMA: Alex? ALEX: Alma! ALMA: Alex! (Alma sobs) (Bang) (Taking deep breaths) (Grunting) ALMA: Alex? Alex? (Taking deep breaths) (Grunting) ALMA: Alex! (Moaning) Alex! (Taking deep breaths) ALMA: Alex, I'm coming! (Alma sobbing) Alex! Mom! (Crying) (Fast footfalls) MUM: Come here. (Alma sobbing) (Crying) It's okay. What happened? Hey. Come on. (Sobbing) (Alma sniffles) MUM: We're going to have to discuss this tomorrow. (Alma sobs) (Creaking) Hey. Hey. It's okay. (Sobbing) (Footfalls) (Bucket clunking) A daughter's weakness is her mother's fault. You're forcing me to do something I don't wanna do. Mum, I'm sorry. Um, I was wrong! (Grunts) I'll-- I'll be strong, I'll-- I won't stop until you forgive me. (Sobbing) MUM: Only weak people cry. (Sobbing) Are you weak, Alma? I'm not weak. MUM: Are you weak, Alma? I'm not weak! How can I take you with me when a dream makes you weak? What's the first rule? Don't go out during the day. MUM: And what did you do? I went out. (Taking deep breaths) MUM: And why can't you go out? ALMA: Because they'll get me. (Coughing) See, I can't let them take you. (Groaning) But I was scared, I... (Thudding) (Taking deep breaths) You okay? (Taking deep breaths) What-- uh... MUM: You fainted. I don't mean to be cruel. ALMA: I know. It's thanks to you the three of us are alive. I try my best to be a good mother. I know this is hard to understand, but I must be strict. I'll get too old and then you'll have to fend for yourselves. (Squeaking) (Slams) (Footfalls in distance) Maybe I was too hard on you with the hunt and-- And everything. (Sighing) MUM: We'll take some time for ourselves. No homework or housework today and tomorrow. ALMA: Yeah. I thought you might want to write another message. Maybe someone will answer this time. I'd love that. (Moans) (Scribbling) (Footfalls) ALEX: I don't understand. You think there's someone out there like us, but you don't want to go looking for them. ALMA: Well, I'm trying to find them, I'm just doing it my own way. Trying would be getting out of here, you know, not hoping that a note is gonna save us! And go where? Do you know where they are? Maybe I do. I mean, has this ever worked? We have to keep trying! We're more likely to get an answer. When? I don't know when. (Scoffs) (Rustling) "I live with my family beyond the Black River. We're okay, but the shadows won't let us cross. If you read this, please put a message in the box and tell us your location." Do you really think someone will answer this? We have to keep trying! ALEX: Till when? Till we get an answer! (Slams) (Footfalls) (Water running in distance) (Door creaking) (Footfalls in distance) I'm sorry about before. I just need to believe that there's someone out there. I know you're scared. You're afraid of being left alone. That's why you say that you'd always love to leave but never do. That's what you're afraid of. You're afraid that something is gonna happen to us to separate us. But it won't. I'm never gonna let that happen. I know. I know. I'm sorry. No. I'm sorry. I just worry about you, that's all. (Sighs) (Chuckles) God, I sound like Mum. (Chuckling) (Kissing) (Sighing) (♪♪♪) (Footfalls) MUM: Whoa, no! Be careful. Mind my feet, it's dangerous. (Mum sighs) MUM: Put your body in line with the target. Arms straight, look at the target. Relax. Aim, let go. (Thwack) Not bad, try again. (Hooting in distance) (Takes a deep breath) MUM: No twisting. Look at the target. Relax. Up, up. Relax. Let go. (Thwack) Good. Now the fun begins. You have to find all the arrows. Remember, never more than 10 steps apart from each other. MUM: Good. (Alex grunts) (Footfalls) I was thinking... What? The messages. Maybe they could actually reach someone this time. -Who knows? -(Alma sighs) Yeah? (Alex grunts) (♪♪♪) (Footfalls) (Rustling) (Footfalls) (Alex taking deep breaths) ALEX: Look at that. Does it look like this in your dreams? ALMA: What? No. Not really. (Water flowing) ALMA: What are you doing? It's so cold. Come on, try! It's not that cold. It's freezing. (Taking deep breaths) Come on, let's go. Do you remember those pirate stories Mum used to read us as kids? We should ask her first. ALEX: Why? It's her idea to leave messages in the woods! We're just doing it in our own way. Shall I? No, um... I'll do it. Okay. (Grunting) ALEX: Okay, um... -Grass. -Yeah, yeah. (Rustling) Right in... (Grunting) -ALEX: ...that. -What are you doing? -Okay. -Come on. (Shushing) -Go! (Footfalls) (♪♪♪) (Sighing) What did you think you were doing? Mum, I'm sorry, we didn't... Why did you go to the river? It was my fault. I wanted to throw a message with the bottle in the river. What bottle? ALMA: We thought we'd try something different. Let go of her! I don't care what you wanted! Why don't you listen to me? Mum, let go of her! (Taking deep breaths) I'm sorry. I get nervous when you don't understand. (Squeaking) (Slams) Did she hurt you? I've never seen her that angry before. (Door lock rattling) (Pushing door handle) ALEX: Hey! (Banging) ALEX: What are you doing? Hey! Alex, stop! Let her calm down! ALEX: Oh! (Alex taking deep breaths) (Squelching) (Thwack) ALEX: This is boring! (Sighs) ALMA: She'll have us rake the weeds for a week. We'll apologize and everything will be forgotten. Alma, we didn't do shit. We went too close to the Black River. So what? She's going insane! ALMA: Maybe you are, too. I never should have followed you. What? Nothing. No. You said you never should have followed me. So what? It's my fault we can't go hunting anymore? Come on, admit it! You think it is! I nearly went out in the day because of you. Are you serious? How can you say that? That was a dream! It doesn't matter! All of this is your fault. Yeah, but you're just a baby who just wants to please Mum! Just because you're jealous! (Slaps) ALEX: Alma, no! (Alex grunts) ALEX: Off! Off, Alma! (Alma grunts) Stop! No! Stop it, Alma! S-- No! Stop! Fine! Fine! I give up! (Taking deep breaths) ALMA: Did I hurt you? No! (Alex taking deep breaths) Are you hungry? (Taking deep breaths) (Scrunching) (Taking deep breaths) How long do you think we've been here? ALMA: I don't know. A day? Two, five? Oh, fuck knows. (Taking deep breaths) ALEX: What are we gonna do? I don't know. ALEX: Do you think she's out there? I'm not sure. (Taking deep breaths) ALMA: Do you think we should apologize? No way. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) ALEX: Mum! Mum! Mum, please! Open the door, please! Mum, I'm hungry! Mum! We can't stand it any longer, please! -Mum! -ALMA: Leave it! ALMA: She uh, she isn't in! And where did she go? Where? She must be here! Do you hear me? I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! -ALMA: Alex! -Mum! Alex, calm down! (Sobbing) Your eyes are green. Look at me, your eyes are green. ALEX: Please, we aren't-- I'm not in the mood! We aren't kids anymore! It doesn't work like that! Your cheeks are red like strawberries. And the gap between your teeth is smaller. (Sobbing) Alma, I love you, but the game doesn't work. And it won't help us get out of here, please. Please, help me. (Sobbing) (Grunting) (Taking deep breaths) (Creaking) Come on, let's go. ALMA: Alex! Come on, let's go! (Fast footfalls) (Munching) Do you think she's here? (Scrunching) (Slurping) (Scrunching) (Knocking) ALMA: Mum? (Knocking) ALMA: Mum? (Alex grunting) ALEX: What the f... (Drawers opening and shutting in background) ALEX: Oh, no. ALMA: Alex, stop. Alex! No! Fine. (Grunts) This is so comfortable. How could she let us sleep on that horrible mattress all these years? She's such a bitch! (♪♪♪) (Grunts) (Sighs) (Clinking) What the hell is all this? (Alex grunts) ALMA: I don't know. Alex, she can be back any minute! This must be the before. ALMA: Is that Mum? ALEX: What the hell are these? Alex, we're gonna get in so much trouble if she finds us! Do you really think everything will be the same? Mum will never let us leave again if she comes back. We have to leave this place. ALMA: Alex. Alex, please, can we just talk about this first? I really don't think this is a good idea. Alex, please! (Alex grunting) ALMA: Please, just listen to me! Are you sure? ALEX: We are sure! (Thudding) But where will we go? ALEX: Somewhere. Anywhere. Not here! ALMA: Oh, stop! (Grunting) We'll move in the night and we'll find shelter in the day like Mum told us! We'll follow the rules! We're gonna get stuck in the light, Alex, I'm sure we're gonna die! We won't. You said we'd never part. Alex, wait. Alex! Wait! (♪♪♪) (Water flowing) (Sploshing) (Alma taking deep breaths) ALEX: Come on. It's okay. We missed the high, yeah? Yeah. Okay. (Sploshing) (Water flowing) (♪♪♪) (Chuckling) Hey. Yeah. (Taking deep breaths) It's okay, eh? We did it. Yeah? -Hmm. -Yeah. Yeah. (Grunts) -It's okay. -(Sighs) It's okay. Okay? We go? -Oh, yeah. -Okay? -Yeah. Okay, let's go. (Sploshing) ALMA: I'm really cold. ALEX: We have to find shelter. (Birds chirping in distance) ALEX: Alma, look! Coming! (♪♪♪) (Water dripping in distance) (Takes a deep breath) (Squelching) (♪♪♪) (Takes a deep breath) I'm cold, too. Um, I'll get some wood. Mmhmm. Gather some dry leaves. I'll only be a moment. Okay, but be careful. (♪♪♪) Look, this used to be Mum's shelter. What are these? Found them on the way. Did you put them there? -I... -You did. So we could find our way back? We have to go back. Mum told you to do it, didn't she? Or worse, you want her to find us. She cares about us. Alex, we have to stick together! There is no "we" anymore! I can't trust you! Alex, the sun's about to come out. (Taking deep breaths) (Grunts) (Lantern shattering) (Alma gasps) (Water dripping in distance) ALMA: Alex! (Alma taking deep breaths) Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! (Alma screaming) (Grunting) (Sobbing) Alex! Alex! Please! Alex! Alex! (Sobbing) (Screams) (Taking deep breaths) (♪♪♪) Where's Alex? Shh. You've been asleep for three days. I found you just in time. Where's Alex? What were you thinking, going out like that? Well, I was worried about you. We wanted to look for you. Did Alex tell you to go? No, it was me. I thought something might have happened to you. Where exactly did you go? Um, we crossed the river and we went upstream. At some point, we got separated, and I got lost, and-- And-- and it was day, and I was scared, and didn't really know what was happening, and I thought it was-- didn't... MUM: Okay, hush. It's all over now. Calm down. I was out, coming back from the Hunt. You're lucky I found you. I don't think you were in the light for very long, so I don't think your skin is burnt, but your foot is in bad shape. You'll have to rest it for a few days. (Alma taking deep breaths) Did you find Alex? You have to rest. I'll take care of everything. Thank you. MUM: You need to finish it, please. (Gulping) There. ALMA: Thank you. Hmm. (Clinks) (♪♪♪) (Sighs) (Munching) I'm worried about Alex. Are we gonna go looking for her? (Drawer opening and shutting) (Footfalls) (Clunk) When I came back and found the door open, I didn't know whether to be worried or proud. It's understandable you want to experience the world. Or what's left of it. Maybe I've been too hard on you. Mum. But I can't protect you anymore. Alex is still out there, we to need to go now. MUM: Alex has made her choice. She's taken the risk to face the dangers out there. It's her responsibility. How can you say that? MUM: You and I, we've have always been close, we've talked things through. But since you've been following Alex, look what's happened. (Sighs) (Creaking) (Rustling) I've allowed this to go on for years. I've indulged you in this fairy tale, 'cause you needed to hope. But the truth is there's no one out there. (Gasps) How could you? Why? MUM: I needed to hope that you'd stay my little girl forever, but that's not possible, so now we have to let go of these fantasies. (Ripping) (Crumpling) MUM: I'm so sorry, but it is just the two of us. (Ripping) (Sighs) I will always be here for you. (Clunking) (Footfalls) (Sighs) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (Clunking in distance) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) MUM: Alma, what are you doing on your feet? Sorry, Mum. You see? You can barely stand up. Here drink this. It'll do you good. Can I have some honey, please? For once. Alright. (Taking deep breaths) (Alma grunts) (Lyrics in Latin) We'll go and look for Alex when your foot is better. I promise. ALMA: Thanks, Mum. (Lyrics in Latin) I think I'll go for a lie down. Yeah. And you take care of that foot. ALMA: Thanks, Mum. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (Lyrics in Latin) (Moaning) (Lyrics in Latin) (Moans) (Munching) (Licking) (Birds chirping in distance) (Rustling) (Birds chirping in distance) (Taking deep breaths) (Quick footfalls) ALMA: Wake up! (Mum moans) ALMA: Wake up! (Moans) ALMA: Wake up, wake up! -(Moans) -Why did you hide it from me? (Mum moaning) (Banging in distance) What else did you hide from me? (Moaning) (Grunting) Why did you lie to me? Why did you lie to me? No. No. ALMA: The messages, the powder, you spying on us. (Grunting) ALMA: The sunlight! Why did you take that away from me? I was protecting you. ALMA: You made everything up! (Alma sobs) I didn't make anything up, Alma! You've always being scared of the light. How can you expect me to believe you after everything? I've kept you away from all of your fears. You just don't remember. What are you talking about? You left for God knows where. I suffered terribly knowing you were in danger. And now you're back. And you're blaming me for doing what any mother would have done. Caring for you. Loving you. So you think you're strong now? Then leave. Goodbye, Mother. Where the fuck do you think you're going? (Grunting) (Door squeaks) (Alma taking deep breaths) MUM: Alma! (♪♪♪) (Taking deep breaths) MUM: Alma! Come out! Come on, let's go back. We can talk about this. (Taking deep breaths) Alma, please. It's not safe here. (Taking deep breaths) MUM: Alma. (Taking deep breaths) (Grass rustles in distance) (♪♪♪) (Mum and Alma taking deep breaths) (Mum screaming) (Mum moaning) Mum! (Taking deep breaths) Mum, it's gonna be okay. I'm gonna find a way out. There's nothing you can do. (Sobs) All I wanted is to be close to you. (Sobbing) MUM: You-- you were in danger, Alma. I had to get you out of there. You were trapped. You were crying. You saw me. You chose me, Alma. You wanted me to be your mother. (Sobbing) What do you mean "chose"? What do you mean? When was this? I felt it the moment I took you in my arms. Mum, please. Please, just no more lies. MUM: There's a big wheel by the river. You'll find a path. You'll have to travel it for some distance. Okay, okay. What's down there? What's there? (Mum groans) (Sobbing) Mum? Mum. Mum. (Sobbing) Mum. (Crying) Mum. (Crying) (Flowing) (♪♪♪) (Takes a deep breath) (Sploshing) (Splashing) ALEX: Alma. Alma, come on. (Splashing) ALEX: Hey! (Splashing) ALEX: Hey, hey! Alma! Hey, hey! (Moaning) ALEX: Out, out! Hey, hey. ALMA: Oh my God. Oh my God, I thought I lost you. You could never lose me. (Taking deep breaths) Alex, Mum, she tried to... And then she fell, but I couldn't help her. I know, I know. (Kissing) (Taking deep breaths) ALMA: Before she died... Before she died, Mum told me about a place. I think we should go there. Yeah. Okay. Let's go. ALMA: Yeah. Come on. Come on.
