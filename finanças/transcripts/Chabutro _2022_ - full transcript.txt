Greetings. I am Buddy. No, no, I am not the one who is Gujarati. He is the one who is Gujarati... - Viraj Patel. - [ALARM CLOCK TICKING] Originally, he is from Ahmedabad but now he lives here... in the US. My world revolves around Viraj... ...but Viraj has a big family that is in India. You must be wondering why is Viraj living here. The thing is that Viraj is fascinated by this place. He is in love with the city and its people. Basically, he loves his life here. He is an Indian bird who has built his nest in this foreign land. [VEHICLE PASSING BY] "Sway a little with dreamy eyes." "Sink a bit or swim... swim across." "Can't tell if it's bright daylight or a starry night." "Shining through my throbbing veins." "What is this Sufi enchantment of the weekend?" "I am lost in myself... lost in myself." "Some scintillating vibes of the foreign land Lures me." "The gleaming silky boulevards of my dreams are calling me." "The intoxicating breeze is drifting me away blinding my eyes." "The intoxicating breeze is drifting me away blinding my eyes." Thank you. - Cheers man. - What's up bro! Cheers. Can I get a shot of Tequila. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] What's up bro! - What's up... cheers bro! - Cheers! Cheers! - Dude, my visa got approved. - What? - All done. - Congratulations. - Congrats! - Thanks. Shreyas bro. God knows when we will get our visa. Don't worry. We will get it man. And what if we don't get it? If we don't, we will go back to India. Anyway I am planning to leave this job and follow my passion in life. Start up. What start up. That I don't know but what's the big deal. I will just copy an idea from here and implement it in India. [LAUGHS] What! This is the time to go back. Anyway there is not much left to do here... ...and in India new developments are coming up. They have made Paytm taking an inspiration from Pay pal... ...Ola from Uber, and OLX from Craigslist. That's true man! And I can't keep on doing this job any more. You have been talking about moving back to India since a year, but haven't... ...and one shouldn't even think of going back. 5 days work week, 2 days weekend and that too with company sponsored parties. Where else would we get such fun life. It's been just 2 years since you have joined this job. Let 4-5 years pass... ...and you will realize how tough it is to come office on a Monday morning. I start feeling depressed from Sunday evening itself. Don't worry, it's Friday today... enjoy. This is their strategy to keep their employees happy. They slog us for the entire week and then get us intoxicated during the weekends. So we don't get time to think about "what is our purpose in life... ...or what are be born to do". We are not left to ask such questions to ourselves. Bro, the strategy is good though. - Cheers. - Cheers. "Holding on to fragile threads, my hopes..." "...and my dreams go hand in hand to a place unknown." "Holding on to fragile threads, my hopes..." "...and my dreams go hand in hand to a place unknown."

"Vibes of the foreign land." "Vibes of the foreign land." [PHONE RINGING] Greetings, grandma, how are you? Greetings, my son, settled into your new apartment. Yes, just finished organising my stuff. Hi, son! What are you doing? I am making my breakfast. Avocado on toast with some mushrooms, have a look. You shouldn't eat mushrooms. You know they grow in a dirty place, right. It's not vegetarian. What! Who told you that, mom? She would have learnt that from What's app forwards. Ok, give us a tour of your new apartment. Sure, Grandma. Alexa open the curtains. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Oh, this is beautiful. But who is Alexa. Is she your house help? No, grand-mom. - Have a look. - What mom, who has house help in the US. This is the lake and view of the downtown. - Lovely, isn't it. - Yes. Where did this dog come from? Mom, this is Buddy. - I adopted him last week. - He is so cute. What else is going on Grand mom? My son has to do all the work by himself, why don't you come back? Mom! Don't you have anything else to talk about? But you don't even listen to me or plan to visit us. Leave it. I have to go to work. I will talk to you later... Bye. [BLEPPING] What? Viraj is not here for most part of the day. What am I supposed to do... get bored? [CRICKETS CHIRPING] MALE:- What is there to show off in a rented apartment? Viraj has moved into a new apartment, adopted a dog. - Is he ever planning to come back? - No. I knew he would not come back when he left for the US. I had told you to not send him abroad. But you were very keen on letting him go thinking that he will come back. Now. Don't be surprised if he introduces you to his wife over a video call one day. Son, Let it be. Why are you giving her stress? He is living his life independently and earning well. Earning well! I am paying more tax on his behalf here than his salary there. [SIGHS] It's been 5 years since he is gone. Dhaval came back, wasn't he getting a job there? Viraj should also join my family business... ...otherwise what was the point of all of my hard work? [COUGHS] Nagji, bring me some water. [HORN HONKS] [FOOTSTEPS] Hey Carol... I am working on the presentation updates. I think I will have it ready by lunch. That's ok, Viraj. Please come have a seat here. Sure. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Viraj, I called you to tell you that... ...there have been some issues with your visa application. We haven't been able to get an approval yet. I am sorry, I am not sure why we are facing issues in your case... ...since we got Shreyas's visa approved this morning. But I am sure it's just a formality. And we will need to simply submit some more... ...documents to justify your need in the company. Unfortunately, it may take 3-4 months. And in the meantime, since your work visa hasn't been approved, its not active yet. You cannot stay or work officially in the US. So... Does that mean I have to stop immediately? Unfortunately yes. But please don't forget to email me your presentation. Bro, Srinivasan in Paul's team faced the same visa issue. He came back in 3 months. You will get your visa too, don't worry. This is just a formality. Carol told you that it will work out, then it will come through. Don't stress about it. It will probably come through... ...but what will I do at home... ...for 3-4 months? Think of it as a vacation. Anyway, you haven't gone home in a while. Spend some time with your family. Eat home cooked food and travel like Shahrukh did in the movie Swades. Once your visa is sorted, you can come back. Excuse me, two beers please. Thanks. Don't take stress. [LAUGHING] By the way, do you remember in Swades, Shahrukh stays back in India? At that time he was needed to provide electricity in his village. But now the government has brought 5G to all rural areas in India... ...so neither you nor Shahrukh are needed there. Don't worry you will be back here soon. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [AMBULANCE SIREN] - Hello. - FEMALE:- Yes, son, tell me. - Hello, mummy. - Yes, son, tell me. I am coming to India. Wow! That's amazing. When are you coming? I am coming soon, there is a problem... ...with my visa but it's just a formality. Until that is sorted, I will need to stay in India. This is great, when I share this with your... ...grandma and dad, they will be really happy. I will cook your favourite dishes. You come soon, I will start preparing everything. Ok, mom. [WIND BLOWN] Let's go, Viraj. BUDDY:- I am excited to visit this new place and meet new people. I don't know why Viraj seems so worried though! [AEROPLANE ENGINE REVVING] Sir, do you want an auto-rickshaw? Do you want an auto-rickshaw? Where do you want to go? No, no. - I will charge you based on the meter. - I don't need one. I won't charge anything extra, it will be a reasonable price. Tell me. - My family is coming to pick me up, please excuse me. I don't need an auto rickshaw. I will take you there in a very less price, do you want to come? Are you looking for a cab? How much are they charging? My family is here. Come Buddy. - Oh, my child. - Greetings. How was your flight? - Okay. - Good. Welcome, son. Was he also supposed to come with you? Dad, where would have I left him for so many months? That's why I decided to bring him with me. Dad, he won't do anything, he's just sniffing you. Please keep him away. How will he come home? He will sit behind in the car with Viraj? - In the car? - Yes. Oh, dad, we will come in an auto-rickshaw. - No, son, we will go in the car. - It's ok, mom. - Ok, we will take your luggage with us. - Okay. Oh but, you can come with us in the car right? Its ok, mom. We will come in Auto rickshaw, it's no big deal. - But, son... - No worries, mom. Come, come, come on. You shouldn't have done that. He could have sat behind with viraj in the car. How would Viraj have felt? How would Viraj have felt? Do you think I liked not bringing Viraj in the car with me? I did come to pick him up in the middle of the night. He brought the dog and didn't even tell us. Had he informed us, we could've brought a different car. You tell me how could we let the dog sit in this car won't it get dirty? And it was his suggestion to go in auto-rickshaw, not me. [HORN HONKS] [MUSIC] Where are you travelling from, sir? I am coming from US. - US! - Can you turn off the music please? Sir, didn't you like the music? I have Bluetooth... ...you can tell me whatever music you like and I can play it. Should I play it? No, I am good. Thank you. [VEHICLE PASSING BY] Your dog is very nice. - He came with you on the plane? - Yes. Was he sitting next to you? No, there is a different place for him. Your dog is very lucky I've spent my life in an auto-rickshaw... ...while your dog is flying in a plane. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [DOGS BARKS] Come, Buddy. I will bring you some money. You can do an online transfer. We have that facility available now. [DOORBELL CHIMES] Welcome. Welcome. Come on in. Buddy! Welcome, welcome. [LAUGHS] Grandma! Oh my child, you are finally here. Finally here. - How are you? - I am very well. - Naagji. - Coming. Buddy, where do you think you are? Where do you think you have come? Please take this plate and keep Viraj's luggage in his room.. Yes, ma'am. Where do you think you have come, my dear? Viraj, do you want me to give you some food? - No, I don't want anything. - [DOG BARKING] Does buddy want anything to eat? No, we will get some sleep now. Yes, come on. Viraj, don't sleep right now as you will be jet-lagged... ...and end up sleeping during odd hours of the day. It's not like you will be jet-lagged your whole life. - It's fine, go to sleep son. - Good night, let's go. - Let's go. - Good night. Isn't he a really good boy? Come, come, come. Buddy. Hey. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Lets' go, let's go. [DOGS BARKING] Buddy, calm down. Buddy, calm down. Buddy. Buddy. Buddy. Hey... hey... sush. - Leave it... - Buddy, come back. Sush... [BIRDS CHIRPING] Are you alright? Yes. Thanks for all your help. It looks like you're new here. I haven't seen you here before. Yes, buddy and I just came here last night. Okay. We came out for a walk this morning and didn't realize that... ...so many street dogs will attack us. - Ok. - I am Viraj. - Hi! I am Paras and he is Rio. - Hi! Hi! Now... Next time carry a stick with you! - Thank you. - Bye. - See you, bye. - Come, Buddy. [DOORBELL CHIMES] Hey, Chinmay. Hello, aunty, how are you? - I am good. How are you? - I am good too. Come on in. It's been a while since you came and met us. Even if Viraj isn't here, you can come to... - ...meet uncle and me. - Yes, where is Viraj, aunty? [Dad] He must be sleeping in his room. - How are you doing, uncle? - I am good. What are you up to these days? Nothing much, uncle. I am here and have joined my dad's business. That's great news. My dad worked hard all his life so now it's my... ...responsibility to take this forward, isn't it? Good, very good. Thank you, uncle! Let's go. You will never change, will you? What did I do? It's all good. [DOG BARKING] - Oh... Don't worry, he won't do anything. - But wait. Viraj, how do I come inside? What happened now, what's stopping you from speaking now? Sit down, sit down. You came home but where have you brought this American dog? How will he like it here? First of all it is so hot here... ...and he can't express his thoughts with us. Hmm... Shake hand. Where are we going? School of Architecture. I worked really hard to get the passes for you. Attack! Go Attack Viraj! Looks like he isn't trained! Did you arrange our entry passes? No, man! Apparently only students and faculties... ...are allowed but we managed to get in somehow. So how do we get in now? Take admission here? What happened? We don't have entry passes. Don't worry I'll manage something. That's so you! Trust me, I'll figure something out. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] - Oh Viraj. - Paras. Hi. What are you doing here? We had come to attend garba but... - Hi! - Don't have the entry passes. Actually I am a student here and also the garba organizer. So don't worry, enjoy. - Okay. Thank you, bro. - No problem. - See you. - Thanks, man! Didn't I tell you I'll figure something out? Thanks. Haha. Looks great. Excuse me, sis. What's up dudes? Who are you checking out? Oh, how did you manage to get in? You don't know me! Did you pretend to be a student or a faculty? - Principal! Wow, Brilliant! - Lets go guys. - Sure. - No, no, you go ahead. - Why? Its really crowded out there. Obviously it'll be crowded, it's not your house party. - Lets go. - You go, I'll join later. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Oh... Sorry. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] I will be there. - Hi! - Hi. You are not from this college, right? No, I came here with a friend of mine. It was really hot outside and I saw a fan in this room so came over. But I can leave if you want me to. No, no, I mean it's okay. Thanks. If you don't mind me asking... what exactly is this? Ahmedabad Old City. Oh. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Ahmedabad Old City looks like this? I have never been there so... Are you from Ahmedabad? Yes. Oh... That's strange that you have never been to the old city. This is the model for my thesis project. I am a final year architecture student. Please add some more trees... ...it's really hot outside. Which college are you from? Actually I work in the US. I have come here for sometime. Oh. What do you do in the US? I am an IT consultant. Okay. What exactly does an IT consultant do? Well I provide strategy and tech solutions... ...for client organizations to optimize their business operations... ...by understanding their customer requirements and their business objectives. Basically I make power-point presentations. [LAUGHS] Okay. Okay. I am going outside to do garba dance. Do you want to join? Actually, I don't really know the garba dance steps. And they are doing really complicated dance steps outside. Are you sure you are from Ahmedabad? Let's go. I'll teach you. OK, I'll try. - By the way, I am Viraj. - Oh! - Hi, Viraj. I am Nivedita. - Hi. - Shall we go? - Ya. "Goddess mother has arrived blissfully." "Goddess mother has arrived blissfully." "She has arrived to bless us for joyful Garba festival." "Goddess mother has arrived blissfully." "Goddess mother has arrived blissfully." "She has brought everyone together by clinking her anklets." "Goddess mother has arrived." "Arrival of mother Goddess makes surrounding gleam brightly." What are you doing here? Let's go, we have to leave. Where were you? Where are you lost? I think someone stole my shoes. "Arrival of mother Goddess makes surrounding gleam brightly." I have connections with the organizers. Call me when you reach the entrance. Wow man! You won't be joining us, right? Take care of my shoes this time. - We had so much fun dancing today. - Yes, absolutely. Let's start. So much food! Did you leave anything for others? Did you bring your dog with you from the US? Yes. That's sweet. Order no. 26. Coming. Sweet! Having a dog has its own benefits. I don't even know whether she is single or not? Of course she is single. Why would she hang out with us if she had a boyfriend? If you aren't interested in her... ...then should I try? Haha. Sure! I will definitely try then. Anyway, leave that. This place is really amazing. Yes. Really unique. This is a food truck park... ...similar to Manek Chowk! This has started recently here. All good? What? Are you going to do bhangra? [LAUGHS] " I am delighted to see Garba." " I am delighted to see Garba." "Seeing enthusism, it drags me to play Garba." "Even I started dancing to the tunes steadily." "Even I started dancing to the tunes steadily." "Feed nemerous types of offerings." "Goddess mother has arrived." "Arrival of mother Goddess makes surrounding gleam brightly." "O' mother Goddess Ambe!" "Goddess mother has arrived." "Arrival of mother Goddess makes surrounding gleam brightly." "Goddess mother is looking beautiful in her attire."

"O' mother Goddess Ambe!" "O' mother Goddess Ambe!" "O' mother Goddess Ambe!" [BIRDS CHIRPING] [PHONE RINGING] [PHONE RINGING] Hey brother, what's up? What's up with you? I am out partying without you... ...and missing you a lot. Okay, tell me, what is happening in the office? What else would happen in office? There is a lot of work, that's all. Looks like that Carol will call you back soon... ...so enjoy the time you have there. Eat Induben's khakhra! Eat Jasuben's pizza... ...and bring me some back too. Who are you talking, son? Mom, it's Shreyas. Asking me to come back soon as he is missing me. Hello, aunty. How are you? Hello, Shreyas. Here, Viraj is like my mom. I really miss the food he used to cook for me. Now you need to get used to living by yourself. This time around I will get Viraj married before he goes back. Mom, have you gone crazy? If you are not finding a girl by yourself, then we can't find one either? What are you saying, mom? - Hello! - How is my wedding related to this? - You have to get married at some point right? - Bro! Mom, please go. - Please, mom. - But... - Mom, please leave. Man, my mom just says anything. - Okay. - See you, man. See you! [MESSAGE RECEIVED TONE] [TEMPLE BELL] Good morning everyone. I am Nivedita, your tour guide. - Good morning! - Good morning! Can you please pass these? - [TEMPLE BELL] - Sure. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Here. So right now we are at the first point which is Kalupur Swaminarayan Mandir. Excuse me. What is way to Swaminarayan temple? Go straight and turn at not the first, or second... ...but the third left and you will reach the temple. Are you sure? Google maps is saying to keep going straight Google maps has only been introduced recently. I have been working as a milkman here for the last 25 years... ...selling black buffalo's white milk for sixty rupees per liter. Follow my directions and you will reach the destination. Thank you. It was built in 1822. It was know for its beautiful artwork on the... ...arches depicting its culture and the religion. - Welcome! - Hi, guys! - Namaste! - Oh Namaste. Please feel free to explore and we will move to the next location in 15 minutes. Ya... Please. - Hi! What's up! - Namaste! Okay. Thank you. You finally made it to old city. I know, I am so sorry I am late. Actually my Google maps got confused. Luckily I found a milkman who showed me the way here. - Oh... Let's go. - Yes... Give me the tour. - Awesome... Let's go. - Sure. Welcome to Dhal Ni pol. So Pol is basically a residential cluster. And every pol has a bird feeder which is called Chabutro. It is basically the bird's home. So no matter where they fly during the day. Once the sun sets, they have place to return to. So guys, this is Manja. It is used for flying kites. We have a kite flying festival called Uttarayan. And the best place to enjoy it is in the old city. The whole sky if filled with kites... ...and in the evening it is lit up with fire crackers and lantern. It's just magical. Viraj, look at this house. Look at the intricate... ...carvings on the column, old and pretty, isn't it? Old and pretty, isn't it? What do you... Oh! What? I really need this. My stars aren't aligned these days. - You are useless. - Seriously? - Forget it.. - What? Nothing... Give me one tea. - You go and sit, I will bring us some tea. - Okay. Give me two tea, please. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Thank you. What are you doing, man? - There you go. - Thank you. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] So, for how long are you visiting? I haven't really thought about it. I am waiting for my visa formalities so maybe 2-3 months. And until then? Not sure yet, probably do some time pass. Hoping I don't have to go to my dad's office though. And as soon as I get my visa, I will immediately go back to the US. Does your dad have a business here? Yes, he has a family business in real estate. Viraj Builders. Wait a minute. That ad that used to come on the radio... Tunak tunak tun Tara rara... Something something Viraj Builders is our name. I can't believe you have also heard this ad. This is what plays on the radio all day long. So, you are the Viraj of Viraj builders? You have a really huge business here... ...then what are you doing in the US? First of all, it is a family business. I am working in the US. It's not necessary that if you have a family business, you need to join it, right? No, it's not necessary but still... ...is there a special reason for you to stay in the US? Yes, so that people like you don't recognize me with that ad. No, but seriously, considering your family background, why did you decide to stay in the US? See I always wanted an independent life... ...and it would be really difficult to stay here and not join the family business. And after living there for this long. I don't think I want to come back. What are you big problems here in India? There aren't any problems as such, but... Just generally the life there is more convenient. Like how? Like... Since I have come here, taking Buddy out on a walk feels like a mission. Have you ever gone to riverfront? I think you should go there. Take Buddy also with you. You'll thank me. [COW MOO] - Oh shit. - What? Oh no. Are you ok? Bro, bring him here and he can wash his feet. Please come this way. He has come from so far to see our city. Oh lady, I have told you so many times not to dump the garbage here. Nobody listens to what I am saying. Should I keep the garbage in my house, then? You just keep giving advice. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [COW MOO] Why did you take a picture of the garbage? So that I can complain about it. So you think, after you complain, this will be cleaned up? Of course. If you don't complain, then how can you expect it to be cleaned up? - Hey, are you ok? - Okay. Thank you! [INAUDIBLE] Thank you so much for coming. I hope you enjoyed seeing the heritage of our old city. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Guys, I have something for you. This is a snack made from fried gram flour. And you have it with this. It's called Sambharo. It's made from papaya and this is Jalebi. It's really yummy, guys. You have to try this. - Bye. - Thank you, bye. Oh, is Sambharo actually made with Papaya? I didn't know that. Are you actually from Ahmedabad? Sorry! I saw fresh fafda being made and I couldn't resist. Damn nice. Ok, what is your plan for now? Nothing much, just going to college now. Ok, come, I will drop you in my car. You came to the old city in your car? Yes. [HORN HONKS] No man. What is this nonsense, where are we stuck? [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Bro, who brings a car to Old city? In the morning when I checked, the roads were clear on maps. Wait one minute. Can you move a little back in that direction? You can go out from this direction. Go, go. And you can go this way. You can get out from this way. You're welcome. Oh Apeksha, my dear. Apply oil on your palms and roll the papad. Otherwise... - ...it won't even dry in 10 days. - Buddy, come. Okay. - Viraj sir, since you weren't, I took him for a walk. Oh! Where did you go out this early in the morning? I went to old city for a heritage walk. Old City? But what is this heritage walk? It is a walking tour and one of my friend was conducting it. In the tour... ...we walk around and see the sites of old city. There were a lot of foreign tourists in that tour. Heritage walk! Did you know we have a house in old city? - It is in Pada's Pol. - Our house? Your dad was also born there. Then when did we move here? Let me tell you. Your dad wasn't fond of living in old city. He didn't like the small houses and the crowd there. So, as soon as he completed his civil engineering, he started his business which became successful. He started earning well. He then bought this land and built this house. It is a strange turn of events... ...when you dad didn't like the old city, we moved here. Then when you didn't like it here, you chose to move to the US. And now you are telling me that foreigners are coming to see our old city. Fascinating! [LAUGHS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Oh, Buddy. - He is eating crackers. - No.. - Hey... Buddy loves eating crackers. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday to dear Naira. Thank you! Happy birthday to you. See how delicious the cake looks. Look who is here to meet you. Happy birthday. Look who is here, so glad you came. What happened? Thank you. - Hi. How are you, Viraj? - I am good. - How are you, guys? It's been a long time. - Good. Here, have some cake. - Good. - How is it? - It's really good! My friend has made this cake. She is a baker. Wait... Pavitra come here. - There she is. - Hi! - Viraj, meet Pavitra. - Hi! - Hi! Viraj is Dhaval's cousin and Pavitra is my best friend. She is the best baker in the world. You wouldn't have tasted a better cake! Ayesha, please stop saying that. No, she is right. - The cake is delicious. - Thank you so much. - Shall we? - Yes. - Nice to meet you. - Bye. - Bye. - So how is the parenthood? - You must have gotten an idea by now! You tell me, what is happening with you? Are you here permanently? No, bro, no. I am here for 2-3 months, there are some formalities with the visa. Once I get the visa, I will immediately go back to the US. How are you doing, son? - How are you, uncle? - Welcome! Thank you I was very happy to hear that you are going to join the business. You have taken the right decision. Uncle, who told you this? I just spoke to your dad. This is the perfect time for the new generation to join the business, isn't it? Yes. - All the best. - Thank you. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [INAUDIBLE] Dad, what did you tell everyone in the party about me? You know that I am going back to the US. Yeah, so go back. Nobody is stopping you. But until you are here... Tell me, do you have any other plans for when you are here? What does the office have to do with this? - But... - Vijay, why are you forcing him so much? If he feels like it, he will come to the office. How is this forcing? It is our business and he is sitting idle at home right now. Ok, tell me something, when he was in the US, did I say anything? Now that he is here... ...would it harm him if he can at least come to... ...the office for a few days and learn something? [TYPEWRITER SOUND] Dear. Don't get offended by your dad. Mom, these are the reasons why I don't like coming home. Between you and your dad's arguments, I am the one who suffers. Who do I listen to and whom should I explain things to? I know that once you get your visa, you will go back. Do you know what your dad wishes for? That you at least go to the office once. And do you know what I wish for? You've come home after so long, and I just want you to be happy with all of us. We don't even know when you will come back again after this. Ok, mom, don't get emotional about this. I will go to the office tomorrow. My dear son. Can I ask you something? Have you found yourself a girl in the US? Oh mom. I am just thinking, you are so handsome. I am sure you have a line of girls behind you. I am ok with having a foreigner girl as my daughter-in-law. Oh man! Mom, there is nobody. Ok, you go to sleep now. Good Night. Good Night. Also, unpack your things from the luggage. It's been in the suitcase for so long. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Thank you for coming to the office, son. We currently have 15 on-going projects out of which... ...Dhaval is managing one. You stay with Dhaval for half the day on-site... ...and then come to the office for the rest of day. This way... ...you can get some knowledge on both the technical and business side of things. And look, this machine is extremely useful. Dhaval, help Viraj understand everything. From today onwards, Viraj will manage this project. Sure. Hey listen, bring the shovel here. Go. Hold this. - Take a picture of us. - Sure. Congratulations, sir! Your son's career has taken off! - All the best and god bless you. - Thank you. - Ok come, let's discuss a few things. - Yes, sir. "Who silenced the winds of change?" "The nest looks so eerily different." "Seems to be hurting from within." "The pigeon stares helplessly at the sky" Alexa, open the curtains. Good Morning, Viraj sir. It's Apeksha, not Alexa. "Yeah, the pigeon." "Tearing up all the threads of desire." "Throwing all pleasures aside." 'Crying and hurting from deep within." Mom, please make something different. Thai, Italian, Chinese. These "sevaiyan" are noodles, if you put these... ...vegetables on top of flatbread it is like having a pizza... ...and this dal dhokli is like pasta. Isn't it? "Can’t find the Chabutro (home)." "Nothing feels good now." "The pigeon feels blue." "Oh no." "Can’t find the Chabutro (home)." "Nothing feels good now." "The pigeon feels blue." Hey, grandma told me that we had home in the old city somewhere at Pada-Ni-pol. Want to go and check it out sometime? Really! I would love to. But I am in submissions. By the way, how's office? Like this, like this. It should look like that... Okay? Do it. Excitement should be seen on your face. Very good, he has learnt how to do this. Brother, see if he's going the poses correctly. I will be back, let me check if the payment is done. "So far, I have just kept doing..." "...whatever I have been told." "But once I get a chance, will reach out for the moon." "To the moon…" "To the moon…" "Yes, to the moon..." Viraj, what are you doing here? You have done so much work in US. - Mom! - Leave it. Oh mom, I enjoy it, that's why I am doing it. That's your misconception, otherwise who likes to do house chores? Buddy. Buddy. Good boy. Oh wow, give me a handshake again. "The pigeon." "The pigeon stares helplessly at the sky." Dad, we are on the left. Yes, but we are going to take a right from here. "Wants to sit on the branch of its choice." Dad, why are you driving this? This is how you drive in here, it's not your US. If you keep following the rules, your turn may never come. See, we got through in single turn. Shape dreams and inspire lifestyle. We are the support to your foundation, our name is Viraj Builders. What, what is this? Compared to this, our old ad was better. Oh brother, do you remember it? Tunak tunak tun Tara. Yes, yes... Let us reconsider their proposal. I think it sounds decent. No, no, an advertisement should have a hook so that it remains... ...in everyone's mind. Forget about it, you won't understand. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. What if we present this ad with the voice-over of a Bollywood actor? I can speak mimic those voices. Like what? Like... [Mimicking in Amitabh Bachchan voice] Viraj builders brings to you their dream project. We built spaces, shape dreams, and inspire lifestyle. We are the support to your foundations, our name is Viraj builders. Good. Thank you, sir. - Sir, Sanjay Dutt. - Really?. - Yes, sir. - Yes, go for it. [Mimicking in Sanjay Dutt's voice] Viraj builders brings to you their dream project. We built spaces, shape dreams, and inspire lifestyle. Hey circuit, we are the support to your foundations, our name is Viraj builders. Let's lock this. Think of more options on this line. Good, good, very good. Hello, Buddy. Ok, at least you are finally free now. Almost. Why almost? Wasn't your project submission yesterday? It was supposed to be yesterday and I had done all the work... ...but they pushed out the submission deadline by two days. So now, I am going to make some 3D views. So yeah. Seriously? Don't you get tired? No, really. Don't you sometimes want work to just end... ...so that you are free, go outside and party with friends? [LAUGHS] Wow man... You know I wish I could also feel this way about my work. As soon as Monday rolls around, I am waiting for Friday... ...to come so that I can go out and party. Wait a minute, I thought you enjoyed your job? Oh man, it's a corporate job. Who likes that? I just love my life there. And for that life, I am ok with doing the job. I fail to understand you and your life in the US. Ok btw, what are you up to this Saturday? I am having a party in my apartment with some friends from college. Why don't you and Chinmay join? Bring Buddy along as well. Yes! Sounds good. Well let me know if you need help! Actually... I do. Help me decide the menu. What should we do? Chinese, pavbhaji? Or paneer tikka and something? Yes, I good marinate some paneer! Marinate some paneer? I am talking about ordering food online. I cannot cook. Oh but I can cook, In fact I love cooking. Are you sure? Yes. Yes, when I was in the US, if there was any house party, I would always cook for that. Ohh. Okay. Ok! So... two, three starters, one main and something for dessert. Sounds good? Two, three starters! One main and the desserts! Yes. Perfect. [VEHICLE PASSING BY] [DOORBELL CHIMES] - Hi. - Hi! Hi, Buddy. Welcome home. Isn't that a lot of stuff? You had mentioned that there are going to be... ...around 10 people, so I bought stuff accordingly. But this much. Obviously! Hi, Cutie. You please have a seat, I will get you some water. What are you planning to make? I am going to make some khandvi tarts, beetroot koftas and some Indian vegetable salad. Fancy! Tell me something that I can do to help. Ya, actually why don't you chop these, like this? - Okay. Okay. Listen why don't you set the table, I'll take care of this. Don't worry. Listen, you can tell me that I am doing a terrible job. Yeah. Little, sorry! - But I ll do it, don't worry. - Sure? Yes. Okay. Oh no, no, these are for my crispy potato skins. Oh. Where did you learn all of this? In the US. When I was in India, I didn't need to go to the kitchen. And in the US there wasn't anyone who could cook for me. I gradually started enjoying cooking... ...and started learning new online recipes. - This smells so good. - Thank you. You do it so well. [DOORBELL CHIMES] - Ah, I'll just check. - Yeah. [DOOR OPEN] - Hello, welcome. - Hi, nivedita. - Oh this is so cute. - Oh is this your dog, wow! - Hey, Buddy. - This is Viraj's dog and Viraj has cooked the food too. Try it. - Oh wow... - Are you a professional chef? - Oh no, no, but thank you. - It's amazing. - Bro. - This is really nice. You should open a restaurant. This looks like it has been prepared by some international chef. Oh! Please don't praise me this much. No, seriously, this is next level. - Too good. - What exactly is this? So... This is a paneer kofta, stuff with... - ...beetroots with some cream cheese and micro herbs. - Wow! Nice. It sounded good, but I couldn't figure out what it meant. [LAUGHS] So what's the plan, guys? Let's play some game. Look what I have got! - Wow! - Check out. Ok, tell me, Uno or Jenga? - Uno. - Let's play jenga. No, let's play uno. Please decide. - Jenga. - Let's play Uno. - Which one? - Ohh hello. - Let's play Uno. What are we playing? - Bring some glasses. - What do you want to... Hey come along. Please sit. Ok, let's play jenga. You all start, I ll join you, guys. - Viraj! - Yes. What happened? Nothing, I am leaving. Why? I have to go. Lets go, Buddy. Is everything ok? Ya. Bye. [VEHICLE PASSING BY] [TRAIN HORN BLARING] Oh brother, dogs aren't allowed here, don't you know? I come here daily, no one has stopped me before. No dogs aren't allowed here, its a new rule. Excuse me, why are you hitting the dog with the stick? What kind of behaviour is this, do you have any sense? Oh sir. If it's a new rule, where is it written? Show me the... ...board where is it written that pets are not allowed. What is going on, Viraj? Oh madam. Look at this guy. He is sitting here with his dog. Our sir has ordered us that dogs are not allowed but he isn't listening. If you have any problem with the rule, go and... ...complain at AMC, why are you troubling me. - You... - Ok, we are leaving. But there is no such rule. - Until yesterday no one was even bothered. - Get going. - Please go from here. Leave. - Get going. - Enough. - We are leaving. It's difficult enough to manage the people. Now I have to manage the dogs as well. [WATER SLOSHING] What's wrong with you, Viraj? Why are you acting this way? So this street dog can go in without any hassle. And if I have to take my pet dog in, I have to take permission? What kind of a place is this... ...and now I am stuck here. What? I would not get my US visa. I cant go back. But... - They have already hired someone on my position. But how can they do that? They can, why would they care. They can easily find 1000 other people as my replacement. You know, Nivedita. Since I was a child, I have been hearing. That you don't need to work hard in life. Everything is set for you. Your dad has such a big business. And that's when I had decided that whatever I do in life, I will do it on my own. And I managed to do that. Went to the US, got a job. Established an independent life for myself. But due to this visa issue, my entire life has fallen apart. Viraj, a visa rejection doesn't mean that your entire life has fallen apart. You can build your independent life here as well. Do anything you want. But do something that brings happiness to you. Because when you do something like that, no one can replace you. And tell me one thing. How does it matter where you live? A person should live somewhere, where they get recognition, where they find purpose in life. Give it a shot... Please. Ok, check out this view. It might not be as great as Chicago, but it has its own beauty. Please see! [LAUGHS] Let's go out for dinner. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Viraj, today there is dinner at your uncle's place, get ready. Mom, I don't want to go anywhere. You will feel better if you come with us and meet everyone there. You will also get to meet Dhaval and Ayesha. Actually, mom, I am going out with Chinmay tonight, I am headed there. [DOOR OPEN] There is one and half hour wait right now. Leave it man, let's go somewhere else. No way, I want to eat here only. Let's go. Excuse me. Yes, sir, your name please. Excuse me, excuse me. Sir, your contact number please. It's going to take another 15 minute, please wait. Could you please let him come forward? It will take some time, sir. Please wait. Yes, okay. What's your name? You have already. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Madam, your name... Please wait and calm down. - Sir... - You all are civilized people. Is this the way you handle your customers? Sir... - I am already exhausted after waiting for such a long time. Give us our table right now or else I would leave. I am extremely sorry, sir. Let us all leave. Sir, your name please. Ankit. - Ankit... sir, your table is ready. - Ready! Come on. What happened? You say that there is freedom and independence... ...in the US and it is the land of opportunities. What kind of freedom is that, where you can't... ...be sure whether you can live there or not? Now things have changed, India is the new land of opportunities. Understand. Don't take stress, things will work out. You focus on this, Mexican Tacos. People get bored of eating the regular everyday stuff... ...and look for new interesting options with innovative presentation styles. You will find it on every table. People from Ahmedabad are really excited about new innovations in food. Get it. Give it a try. Where is my spoon? - Ankit here. - Yes, sir. Ankit... Thank you, sir. How was the food? Please do visit us again. What? I didn't even get the table yet! What are you saying, sir? Ankit, 2 persons. Sir 9898... is that your phone number? Yes, it's my number. Sir, you have already been allotted the table. What are you talking, man? Sir, can you please check if you have gotten the table? What do you mean? I am right here and still hungry. [VEHICLE PASSING BY] But he is really sad and disappointed, so please try talking to him once. What do I tell him? Whatever has happened has happened... He will lament for a couple of days and then move on. In a way, it happened for good. Viraj doesn't understand what is good for him in life. It worked out well that I made him join the office. Else he would have wasted his time here, like he always does. NIVEDITA V/o:- You can build your independent life here as well. Do anything you want, but do something that you genuinely enjoy doing. Because when you do something like that, no one can replace you. How does it matter where you live? A person should live where their life has a purpose, where they are recognized. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] I will serve myself. Thank you. I have great news to share. I have purchased land in the prime location in the city. We will build our new commercial project there and Viraj, you will lead that project. Dad, I don't want to join our family business. I have decided to do something on my own. What do you mean that you don't want to join our family business? What exactly are you planning to do? I have decided to open a food stall in the local food truck park. Tell me one thing. Do you even think before deciding on what to do in life? As you never discuss anything with us. You had gone to study in America... ...and ended up taking a job up there. Now, when your visa has been rejected, you decide to do this. - Vijay... - Mom, please, let me talk. He plans to become a street food vendor. That is what is left to see. Tell me one thing. How many food orders you will have to fulfill... ...to make the money equivalent to selling a flat? Dad, what exactly is your problem? You. Whatever I do in life, you never appreciate it. And what should I discuss with you, are you... ...even interested in knowing what I want to do? You want everyone to do what you would like them to do. And I am really sorry, Dad. I won't be joining our family business. I had moved to the US to avoid all this and now... ...that I am here, I will do what I want to do in life. I don't know what I am going to do, whether I will succeed or not. But judging any work by money and looking down upon it, isn't something one should do! [FOOTSTEPS] [ENGINE REVVING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Hi. Hi. So listen... I have decided to open a food stall. I think the food park is a perfect place to give it a shot. This is amazing. I always thought food is what interests you. This is so cool. I can help you set it up. Thanks. Because I don't know if I will be able to do it. I mean, I don't have any experience or professional degree. There is a difference between cooking for friends casually and cooking professionally. How does it even matter, you are a great cook and that is what matters. You will be amazing, promise. - Really? - Yeah! Wow, an IT consultant turned chef. Not bad, Viraj. [LAUGHS] Wow. I am planning to open a food stall. Would you like to join me? You are starting a food stall. Wow! Sure. "It moves slowly." "And it has its ups and downs." "But I like this life." "In issues of its own choice." "In dreams of its own." "My life is fulfilled." "All the petty things." "Now seem sweet and melodious." "With its baggage off." "Life’s caravan zips along with a zing." "All the petty things." "Now seem sweet and melodious." "With its baggage off." "Life’s caravan zips along with a zing." "He Ji Re." "Ha Ji Re." Bitter gourd is 30 rupees per kg, brinjal is 50 rupees per kg. Can you please call Eggplant instead of Brinjal? Do you sell bok choy, avocado, asparagus, micro herbs? We sell vegetables here! These are vegetables. Man, what are you doing? You get everything online now a days. My grand mom too orders online. Sorry, bro. Let's go. Even we should start selling these foreign veggies. - The demand is increasing now a days in the city. Yes, sir. "Stopped all crafty calculations." "And locked away the scheming mind." "And threw away the keys." "Why live being scared." "Half-hearted and suffocated." "Let the heart hum songs and drift away." "All the petty things." "Now seem sweet and melodious." "With its baggage off." "Life’s caravan zips along with a zing." "He Ji Re." "Ha Ji Re." "He Ji Re." "He Ji Re." "Ha Ji Re." "He Ji Re." Let's eat somewhere else. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Relax. You start preparing up for the night... ...my friends would be here in sometime. - You finish that up, I'll get on with this. - Ok, I'll do it. - Can I get the menu? - Let me know when you finish this. - I'll hand over the two plates to you. - Yes, yes, yes. - I'll be at the other stall. - Okay. - Stuffed mushroom... - Hi! Hi, you are Pavitra, Ayesha's friend, isn't it? - We met at Naira's birthday party. - Yeah, hi Viraj, how are you? I am good. I didn't realise your food stall is here, I come here almost every week. Oh. Really? Actually it's our first day here. That's great, congratulations. Thank you. By the way, weren't you planning to go back to the US? Yes, I was but not any more. - Ok great. - Shall I place the order? - Please. - Handvo and Berry Rabdi. - Okay. Good choice. - So, how is it going? - Going really well. Oh! Hi, Nivedita. Meet Pavitra. - She is a baker and makes amazing cakes. - Hi! - Hi! Pavitra, meet my friend Nivedita, she is an architecture student. Pleasure meeting you. Nice to meet you too. Ok, all the best. See you. Thanks... bye. Okay. I have some amazing reviews to share. The food is exceptional. Presentation is superb... ...and khandvi tart is not just fulfilling, but soul-filling. - Really? - Yes! Listen, can you call Paras and friends, their food is ready. Give it to me please, I ll take it for them. - Ok thanks. - Yeah! - No problem, he is really talented. - That's true. - Wow. - The food looks amazing. I am sure, you wouldn't have tasted something like this. Take a photo first. How is it? [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] - He wanted to leave this and go the US. - Now he won't go. Now he won't, he has found his passion, he won't go back to the US. - Isn't is delicious? - Please tag me too. [MESSAGE RECEIVED TONE] Hi One handvo and one stuff mushrooms. - Got it. I will let you know. - Thank you. Great! Today, I expect a lot more customers. You remember Pavitra? She posted about my food stall on Instagram... - Yes. ...and then Foodaholics of Ahmedabad reposted it. They have more than 30k followers. Isn't it crazy? Viraj sir, should I make 'que-Se-dil-lah' Mahesh, it is pronounced as 'quesadilla'... Okay. "Holding on to fragile threads, my hopes..." "...and my dreams go hand in hand to a place unknown.." 'Jhala-pino...' No. 'Ken-chino'... Nah it's pronounced as 'Jhala-pino'... No, it's yalapino, sir! Can you suggest something to me? You could try the khandvi tart, it's really good. Alright, I'll go for it. Please have a seat, I'll let you know when your order is ready. Thank you. Its been over a month that you and Viraj aren't talking to each other. Stop it, it's enough now! Grandma, roti. Thanks, son, I am done. Why are you eating less today, mom? I don't feel like eating. Get me one roti. Sir, how would you like it to be... Medium rare or well-done? What? I mean do you want it soft or crispy? Get me a burnt one. - Son, you are here! - Softly. - Son, you are here! - What did you get? - See. Khandvi tart and berry rabdi. Tired? Not really. Someone had rightly said, if you do something... ...that you love, you don't feel tired. Is it so... not bad. But I can't believe all of this is happening, and it is all because of you. No, it's because of you and your cooking. Still, if you weren't around, none of this would have been possible. So thank you very much. Hungry? - Ya. - I am starving, let's eat. Congratulations, Nivedita. - Congratulations! - Thank you! - Thank you so much. - We will need a party. - Sure. Thanks. You can only do all of this. Nivedita, I heard about your selection, congratulations. Thank you, to you too. - Thanks! - Oh, congratulations. - Thank you. - [PHONE RINGING] - Congratulation! - I will be right back. - Please. - Sure. Aditya, tell us something about your project. Sure let me show you. Hi. Hi, Nivedita. Guess who is nominated in the Ahmedabad Food awards best food truck category? Congratulations, that is amazing. Thank you. I have a news to share too. Yes, tell. My project has been selected in the competition. What? Congratulations, this calls for a double celebration. I know! Let's meet up for lunch tomorrow to celebrate. I have some other plans during the lunch time. Can we meet in the evening? Pavitra has invited me to a brunch party at her farm house tomorrow. She is also nominated in the best bakers category. I have to go to the old city in the evening, so lets meet up at some other. Ok sure. Having schools, civic spaces, hospitals and public transportation... This entire city is a futuristic model. Wow friend, this looks great. I can't believe that this kind of city can be... ...developed here, it looks similar to New York. Satellite cities are the future of India, and we will build that future. Competition would be interesting this time. At one end we have a futuristic project and at the other historical. Of course. Okay. See you. How is everything in the office? All good. - Wow! - Hi. Can you pass me the plate? Sure. Look at the platter, there is gooseberry, mulberry, blueberry... ...flavoured cakes and the most basic. Chocolate cake is missing. - Where is blueberry one? - Right there. Yes. How is it going at your food stall? Sorry we haven't been able to visit yet. It going great. We have heard a lot about it. I hope good things. Of course. In fact, our uncle and my dad are happy about the fact... ...that you are doing something that you like and all by yourself. [BIRDS CHIRPING] I am sure my dad doesn't feel the same. Don't worry about him. Father's can't stay upset with their sons for long... ...as time will pass he will be able to understand you better. Ya thanks. - Can I have that one? - Hey. - Hi! - Hi, Viraj, I hope you are having fun. Yes. Everything is great and the food is amazing. Which flavour did you like the most? I like all the fruity flavours. Berries are my favourite. Really. Yeah. Don't tell me blueberry. Yeah. Okay. We are starting another round of board games. Unfortunately I will have to leave. Why? It's already evening and I need to do some food preparations... ...at the stall for the night. So, I will have to leave. Oh. Don't you think we should catch up more often? Yeah. Absolutely, sounds good. Whenever you are free. Okay. Alright. Bye. See you guys. Bye. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Stop, stop, stop. Hi! Viraj! Hi! I am so sorry that I couldn't meet you in the afternoon today... ...but congratulations again for your selection. Thank you! But what are you doing here? You told me that you'll be in the old city. So I though I'll surprise you. Sweet! Thanks. But I was about to leave as my work is done. Ok. Bye. Viraj. I have an idea. Let's go visit your old house. Sure. Lets go. After you. Bro, take us to the 'Pada no Pol'. [ENGINE REVVING] Excuse me, where is Ila aunt's house? Thank you. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Ila aunt. Yes, who are you? I am your old friend Kanta's grandson. The one who used to live here years ago. Oh, she is a close friend, how is she? She is great, she misses you a lot. Decades have a past, we had big social circle here. First, Kanta moved out to a new house... ...then one after the another everyone left over the years. Where is our old house? Take a left after 3 houses in this street. The house right in the front of that street is yours. You'll be able to find it easily. - You go ahead, I will send the keys with someone. - Thank you. [THUNDERING CLOUDS] Looks like that one. How did it start raining? Come here. [SIGHS] Don't know why Dad hasn't decided to sell... ...this old house. It is in such a bad condition. It's not easy to sell a property in this area. As there aren't many buyers. [DOG BARKING IN THE DISTANCE] Wait, are you sketching this? Hold on, it doesn't look like this. It doesn't right now, but it can, in the future. Imagine if there are cafes here. There are shops here. The old facades have been restored. There are dustbin at regular intervals. Parking spots are properly marked so that people don't park anywhere. Street are well lit and clean. Then, our old city is no less then any European city. We visit foreign countries and appreciate their history and architecture. But in reality, we too have great art, architecture, heritage and culture. It's just that we need to preserve it. And that's what I am proposing in my thesis project. Wow, I mean it's really cool. I have never imagined that the old city can look like this. But if I think about it now. Seems like it is possible. I hope the jury gets it too. It's really important for me to win this competition. Because the winning project will get government attention... ...and there are chances it will get implemented. Wouldn't that be great? If this is what you are proposing, then I am confident that you will win. Are you sure? Yes. Excuse me. Could you help me find this... ...address? I can't seem to find it on the maps. Bro, maps wouldn't work here. Just go straight and then take a left. You will reach your destination. Okay. Thanks. - Here are your house keys. - Let's go. - Nivedita, let's go. - Yes. "My body is showered in the clouds of love." "The purity of dew drops rises within me when I am with you." "What kind of love is this!" "I am losing my mind." "And beats of love abound." "My heart is at peace, detached from all." "Lost in the colours of your affection" "I left behind one and all." "My heart is at peace, detached from all." "Lost in the colours of your affection." "I left behind one and all." "What kind of love is this!" "Like Meera’s pure devotional song."

Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. Congratulations, sir! - Hi, sir. This is RJ Charmy from My FM. - Hi! First of all many many congratulations! Thank you! I have ordered you food online. And I am a big fan of your food and your cooking skills. - Congratulations once again. - Thank you. - You deserve the award. - Thank you. I would like to do an interview with you on my radio show, when can we do that? - Wow. - Excuse me, sir. We would like to take a photo of yours. Please go ahead, we will discuss that later. - But anytime! Thank you. - Thanks. Bye. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [CHANTING] Good morning. Good morning, mom. What's up with you? How come you woke up so early? Do you have any work stress? Then why aren't you sleeping well? Viraj feels that I am not able to understand him. He feels that I am not his well-wisher. Do you really understand him? Can I tell you something? During the initial days in your career. You too started with small contractor jobs. You father did not like what you were doing then. He wanted you to follow his path and take up a government job. But you chose to do what you wanted to do. Today your father is no more. But if he was alive today, he would have understood you and your vision. You should try to understand what Viraj wants and... ...not commit the same mistake as your father did. Keep it. - Good morning, dear. - Good morning. Sir. Sir. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [VEHICLE PASSING BY] Dad... Here! I came to see what you are doing. I never knew about such new places. Good. You remind me of my days of struggle. I would sit day and night and monitor the construction process on the site. It was a tough job but I really enjoyed it. What you are doing today... ...requires a lot of hard work. But the joy of it is something that you'll never forget. I wasn't scared earlier, as I didn't really have anything to lose. But since the time you came into my life, I have worked harder to make sure you get what you want in life. But I forgot that you are my son. You enjoy your share of struggle and hardships like I did. I am sorry I realized it late. Dad! [DOGS BARKING] Go get the ball. Come back. Drop the ball. Look here. Take this. Look here. Take this. Did you see how smart is he? I'll show you something. Let me throw your car keys... ...and Buddy will look for it and get it back. Really, will he get it? Yes, don't worry. Buddy, see this. Go find this key. He'll go and find the keys now. He keeps on giving me... - Go! - ...and back to back tasks. I don't want to go. Go and bring the keys. I hope you have the duplicate car keys at home. [LAUGHS] [PHONE RINGING] Hello! Hi, Shreyas. SHREYAS:- Did you get my email? Which email? Bro, your visa has been approved and I have been promoted as a manager. I have hired you in my team. Finally you can come back. Okay. I am in the middle of something right now, I will call you later. You go ahead and book your tickets. Come back soon. I miss you a lot. Bye. Viraj sir, here's a letter that was delivered for you. Thank you. This project is a beautiful example of new design and architecture. And I strongly believe that... ...this is time to bring a change in designing and planning. I really thank all the jury members for their time. And thank you everyone for kindly listening. - Thank you so much. - Good presentation! [APPLAUSE] Hey! Wow! You look really nice. Why are you so late? My presentation is already over. What? Seriously? No, I am going to present next. Oh, why are you messing with me? I was stuck in the traffic and couldn't even find parking. Anyway, listen, I have to tell you something. Even I have to tell you something. - Ok, you go first. - Okay. One of the jury members today... ...is the director of Ahmedabad Heritage Management Cell and... ...he is aware of the fact that I conduct heritage walks in the old city. So I think this might work in my favour. Don't worry, I know you will be amazing. Thank you. - Ok, tell me, what news were you about to share? - Yes. You won't believe what happened today morning. I got a call from my office. They told me that they have hired me again and my visa has been approved too. Can you believe it? [BIRDS CHIRPING] - Hey, what's up, bro? - Hi! Nivedita, let's go. - Okay. - All the best. All the best. I am looking forward to see this project. Hello! My name is Nivedita and this is the project that I have designed. It is about restoring the old city... ...and you can find the detailed layout in these sheets... [INAUDIBLE] I think this is the need of the hour and... ...we really need to do this and that is all. Thank you. [APPLAUSE] Your design looks very interesting. But... ...it is difficult to implement it. I can understand, sir, but collectively... ...we could do something. It's really important to bring such changes in the city. Yeah, but still it is unrealistic. You have shown cafes and shopping stores in your 3D views... ...but the problem is... ...who will invest in the old city? I know it is difficult to bring in private investors for a project like this. But if the government decides to make some policy... ...regarding this, it is possible to implement it. I am sorry to say that there is no prospect for investment here... ...and for future development prospects we would need an investment. In my honest opinion, if you had taken up a project of the restoration of old historical monuments, it would have been fruitful. This project is unrealistic. Thank you very much everyone. We had some really interesting presentations today. Winners will be announced shortly. Nivedita, wait. What? I am not in a mood to talk right now, please. Calm down, I know you are disappointed but... But what? That you have put in your best efforts... ...and a jury can't decide whether your project is good or not. So who will decide? You? Why are you talking to me like this? I don't need anyone's sympathy right now. It's clear to me that no one actually cares about the old city. And you were correct... ...nothing is going to change here. - Nivedita, I didn't mean that. - Viraj, please. It is my mistake. I should have realised earlier that this world works practically. But I think emotionally. I care whether development happens in the old city or not. And whether you stay here or not! Hello, leasing office. I called to cancel the lease of my food stall. Yes. Thank you. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Mom, I am doing okay. My exams are over and I am coming back home tomorrow. Yes. Okay, bye. Brother, please take me to the railway station. Sure. Can you please turn off the music? What happened, ma'am? You didn't like it. I can play something that you like, I have Bluetooth. Give me, I will play it. No, I am good. Please take me to the station. Today we have a special guest with us. Welcome to our studio, sir. Thank you. First, tell me that after staying in the USA for 6 years, you decided to move back to Ahmedabad and open a food stall. Why? [LAUGHING] It's a long story. I always imagined my life in the US. Maybe because of the comfortable and hassle free life there. I had a decent job with a good salary in the US. But I couldn't relate to the work I was doing. I did that job to enjoy life in the US. When I had to move to India, I kept on... ...trying to find my way back to the US somehow. I could just see problems here everyday. I never imagined that I could stay here and do something in life. And then I met a girl... ...an architecture student. She is completely opposite to me. She is really passionate about her work. She loves Ahmedabad. And is always willing to do something for the betterment of the city. Earlier, I felt that work is something that you... ...have to do to afford the things you love in life. But she taught me your hobbies can become your work too. In the last 3 months, I opened a food stall. Won an award. And today I am giving a radio interview on your show. To be honest, none of this would have been possible without her. The amount of love and recognition that I have received in this city... ...is like a dream for me! And even she had a dream. VIRAJ V/o:- A dream of a beautiful old city. I am going to do something for her dream. I want to show everyone a small glimpse of it. And that is why I have decided to open my new restaurant in the old city. You know it's very easy... ...to say that nothing will change here. Everything will remain like this. But if you step out and see that so many people are working hard to bring a change. You don't need to become a politician or join... ...civil services to bring a change in the city. You can try to do something that contributes to the... ...city and the people, in whatever field you are in. A little contribution from your end will go a long way to bring about a larger change. And you'll feel more connected to this place. Today I have a chance to go back to the US... ...but I am not even thinking about it. As it doesn't matter where you are. A person should stay where he gets recognition, where he finds his purpose in life. I got recognition in this city and found my purpose in life too. It was lovely talking to you. And another lovely think is. Today is Uttarayan (kite flying festival), what are your plans for the day? Well, someone has told me that if you want to experience the best... ...Uttarayan you have to celebrate it in the old city of Ahmedabad. That's absolutely true. Thank you so much for sharing your journey with us today. Brother, please take a U-turn. And all the best for your upcoming restaurant. Thank you. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] You don't even know how to fly a kite! I take a little time but if you'll teach me... ...I will be able to. Are you sure you are from Ahmedabad? Tell me something? Do you take so much time to realize everything? [AD PLAYING ON RADIO] [LAUGHS] "My heart is at peace, detached from all." "Lost in the colours of your affection." "I left behind one and all." "My heart is at peace, detached from all." "Lost in the colours of your affection." "I left behind one and all." [FIRECRACKER BURST] BUDDY:- And if we talk about me, I am completely fascinated by this place. Street dogs have become my friends now. I prefer Khakhra over my dog treats. I spend more time with Dad than Viraj. Hey. - How are you, dad? - Wow. Everything has changed here. Wow! Mom-dad, she is Nivedita. - Hello! - She renovated the Haveli. Very good. It looks so nice now. Thank you. - Shall we? - Yes. You have done such a great job. I couldn't have imagined it. Sir, should I get you some burnt Bread? You don't talk to me! [LAUGHS] Burnt bread? You don't talk to me! "Stopped all crafty calculations." "And locked away the scheming mind." "And threw away the keys." "Why live being scared." "Half-hearted and suffocated." "Let the heart hum songs and drift away." "All the petty things." "Now seem sweet and melodious." "With its baggage off." "Life’s caravan zips along with a zing." "He Ji Re." "Ha Ji Re." "He Ji Re." "He Ji Re." "Ha Ji Re." "He Ji Re." "Who silenced the winds of change?" "The nest looks so eerily different." "Seems to be hurting from within." "The pigeon stares helplessly at the sky." "Wrapping its wings closed, gazes the pigeon." "Yeah, the pigeon." "Wants to sit on the branch of its choice." "Embracing the dreams closer to its heart." "To be free, and fly with wings wide open." "That is all what hopes the pigeon." "Don’t want to endlessly suffer." "With my eyes shut." "Says the pigeon." "Can’t find the Chabutro (nest)." "Nothing feels good now." "The pigeon feels blue." "Oh no." "Can’t find the Chabutro (nest)." "Nothing feels good now." "The pigeon feels low."
