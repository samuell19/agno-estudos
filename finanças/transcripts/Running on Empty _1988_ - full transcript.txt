Hey, let's go now! Hey, hey, hey! Yeah! Hey, man, believe it or not, you made the starting line-up. No shit. Yeah, andrews has the chicken pox. You're good for two games at least. That's great. If you don't like it, why do you do it? Baseball's my life. Jomo! Jomo, come here! Come here. Now, listen, jomo. I want you to take this to harry. Take it to harry. Go on, take it to harry! Go on! Go on, jomo! Jomo! Jomo! Come on. Come on. All right, come on! I still think you should go. I can't get off from work. You're the one that knows all those statistics. I can't remember nothing. My brain's a sieve. How did you learn all that stuff? It's in the government reports. It's in the library. You think they'll really listen to us? If they don't, there will be 1,500 barrels of radioactive waste buried a few miles from here. I'll rehearse you. There's a point arena delegation going, too, and joe will be there. I got to go. I'll Miss my ride. Oh, martha. Remember-- The study group's at my place on thursday. ok. How'd it go? They wanted me to lobby in tallahassee. I told them to send joe and paula. The nerve those assholes have, putting that shit near humans. Let's blow this pop stand. I'm starving. We got shoes, two cars, four feds. Stay. Stay. Stay. mom! There's jomo! You two get into bed. What's going to happen to her? Someone will take her home. We never left her before. -hE kept that! -gEt into bed! It's morning! Get into bed! I'm going to wash my hair. Who's this? Mom and dad. Who do you think? You're kidding! "arthur and annie pope continue to elude capture "despite several sightings of the couple, "who went underground after claiming responsibility "for the 1971 bombing "of the university of massachusetts military research lab." What's "elude" mean? Not getting caught. "the laboratory is credited "with the development of napalm, used extensively in the vietnam war." Why'd they have to blow it up? Because they didn't stop making it when they asked them politely. Come on, danny. I'm serious! They were dropping that stuff on people. "annie pope is the former anne patterson, "daughter of donald patterson, president of american telekinetics." Is this grandpa? It must be. And grandma? Yeah. Do you remember them? no. Not even a little? They look kind of uptight. Industrial waste all around! Get 'em while they're hot. Get' em before they rot. All right! Where's your mother? She's in the shower. I talked this morning with some of the people who knew the pope family. John kungle played ball with the young man who was known as richard mcnally. He was a good friend? He was a cool dude! That's how legends are made. What's his iq? 49? No. He's going to ucla. No kidding. No, I'm not kidding. He's going to ucla. Excuse me. These photos are 20 years old and are not considered too reliable. The couple is still wanted for the 1971 bombing of their university lab, in which a janitor was blinded. Miami fbi officials said the popes should be considered as possibly armed and dangerous. In further local news-- There's food for you. You look pretty, mom. get into bed, kemo sabe. Ok... Let's see. Blue eyes, blond hair. You're ok. Or are you? What's the matter, kid? I don't know. I just feel kind of lousy, you know? You're supposed to feel that way at 17. It's terrific not recognizing yourself when you look in the mirror. It's wonderful having a new name every six months. We were there a long time. It's hard to leave. We may have to cut your hair, too. no. Maybe this time I could shave my head. send Your brother in. Yeah. I hate this. Phillies won again last night. Things are looking good, then. Things are looking great! The macarthur feud with truman. I don't think we covered that in the local paper. You'd better try the washingtonian. No, I'm interested in how it affected the nation's heartland. This is social history. I could show you the eagle. We just put our back issues on microfilm. Here. This is it? Mm-hmm. Sit right over there. St. Martin's hospital, medical records. $3.00? yes. Where do you want it mailed, Mr. Mansfield? Manfield. I'll pick it up. I need a passport. The company's sending me to cairo. You in oil? Military. Your favorite oldies station in norfolk, virginia... Ralph, the cat needs to be fed. Need anything else? No. I'll call the booth again in two weeks. ok. Listen, your mother... She died four weeks ago-- Cancer. Your father was with her. You were just too hot to contact. Said to tell you not to worry about him. He's ok. Sorry. Ok, who wants lunch? me. How's, uh... Tuna? Yuck! This kid in my class traded me duke snider for valenzuela. Yeah? So? So he's a jerk! Snider's worth about $20. He's from the brooklyn dodgers. He's old! This card is an antique. Can I have white bread? Just eat it. Hey, kid? You, what's your name? Michael. Why are you asking him that? He's not used to it yet. He better get used to it fast. What's my name? Paul. Paul what? Paul manfield. Spell it. M-a-n... F-i-e-l...d. What's your mother's name? I'm waiting. Cynthia. And your brother? Stephen. All right? What the hell's your problem? Got some clothes in the city. Why don't you-- You can wear the thrift shop ones. The new ones have to be washed first. Yes, sir! Sorry about this afternoon. Sophie's dead. What? A month ago. The big "c". Babe. I talked to her after the feds came to tell her we were ok. She never let on. I could just see her standing there with morris-- Two fat old jews, ex-bolsheviks, talking to their red-diaper baby on a phone from a laundromat... And she's fucking dying. That lady loved me. Last winter, when they arranged to have her meet me in chicago, she flew there on an hour's notice... Alone, in a blizzard. She's terrified of flying. She was green when she got off the plane. I took her to the lounge to talk. We sat in a corner, and I said, "i wish it was easier." "you wish it were easier," she says. She's correcting my grammar like I'm one of the kids she teaches. There's nothing left to go back to now. There's only us and the boys. We're all that's left. We must... We have to hang on to each other. May I see his records? I'm afraid I lost his records. I packed them, but I can't find them. I'm always losing things, right? My husband says i'd probably lose my head if it weren't screwed on. Make sure you write for those records, ok? You can have two electives-- Music, typing, mechanics, computer programming, or home economics. Music. and? and? two. Oh, uh... Home economics. His dad's a cook. ok. Find an empty seat, mr. Manfield. All right. Listen up, everyone. All right! Yeah! Whoa! Whoa! All right! Whoa! Yeah! ♪♪ you must be my lucky star ♪♪ ♪♪ 'cause you shine on me wherever you are ♪♪ ♪♪ think of you ♪♪ ♪♪ and I start to explode ♪♪ ♪♪ I think all night-- ♪♪ listen again, please. Can anyone tell me the difference between these two pieces? yes? One's pop and the other is classical? At least we know you're not deaf. How about you, mr. Spaulding? Could you give us a deeper distinction? Well... The first one's bad... oh! oh! And the second one's good. Well, that's, uh, a matter of opinion, not a fact. I'm sure several people in this room would disagree. How about you, mr. Manfield? Would you venture a guess? Well... You can't dance to beethoven. Oh, baby! That's very good, manfield. Do you listen to much beethoven? No, not really. How did you identify this piece? I guess I've heard some. Well, I'm sure the rest of the class can identify the other composer. You're correct. You can't dance to Mr. Beethoven. Can you tell me why, mr. Manfield? Because the beethoven piece doesn't use a constant rhythm or tempo! oh! oh! oh! And madonna's 4/4 time all the way through. The melody changes, but the rhythm is constant, so you can dance to it. The quartet changes both melodically and rhythmically. I'm going to play them again. You listen for this. Mr. Manfield? We'll have to find an instrument for you. An instrument? Everybody who takes music is required to play in the orchestra. Do you play something? Piano. Play something. Well, you don't have to play in the orchestra. I'd like to hear how you sound on the steinway I have at home. Get out of here. Hai... ya! Get a job, dad? You bet. I'm-a za cook! Guess-a which kind. Italian? You got it. Radical! Do you have to say that? Where'd you get this? Public library lost and found. April can be cold up here. Thanks. Keep those slugger hands from cracking. Did you make the team? Yeah. Great. What about me? Sorry. Nothing in your size. We have to chop some firewood on saturday. I'll do it tomorrow. I'm not going to school. How come? They're taking class pictures. How's that school? Teachers know anything you don't? They're ok. Did you have any trouble with registration? I had to see the guidance counselor. and? He wanted to know what colleges I applied to. What did you tell him? I said I hadn't decided. Good. Just tell them something. Otherwise, they'll keep bugging you. How about you, small stuff? I don't want peppers. oh. Ah-choo! There's a kid in my class who's really crazy. You're not the poster child for mental health. He knows train schedules. It might come in handy. Really, dad. All over. He knows what time trains leave from omaha to atlanta, georgia. Get to know this kid. What are you doing with that safety pin? What safety pin? I got a job. My dear, how will you contribute to this false capitalist economy? I'll be a receptionist for a Dr. Milton cosswell. Yeah? There was a sign at the post office. He doesn't mind paying me in cash. It's probably good for his taxes or something. Anyway, it means I can pick up supplies if we need them, and he seems like a pretty nice guy. Oh, mom, thanks! Thanks. Well, sounds good. Looks like we all got what we wanted. Hello? Hello. Is anyone home? Hello. Who are you? I live here. Who are you? Is Mr. Phillips your father? yes. Is this you? I've destroyed the negative. I belong here. How about you? Your father said I could use the piano. The door was open. We do have a bell. I rang the bell. No one answered. Sorry. You go to the school? Yeah. I haven't seen you there. I just started. How come you're not there? I had a fever last night. My mom made me stay home. I'm better. I was bored. You're strange. I cut. I didn't feel like having my picture taken with those subhumans. You're very good, you know. Oh, I'm ok. What's your name? Oh. Michael. I'm lorna. Better be going. Where are you from? Oakland. Born in california? New york. I want to go to school there. My mother's afraid i'll get mugged. Your family move a lot? No, not really. You play? Nah. God, no. I couldn't stand to practice. My older brother is the virtuoso. He's at yale. He does everything right. Where are you going? Oh, that. I haven't thought about that much. You're going to have to apply next semester. Yeah. What do you mean, yeah? Look. I really... I got to go. You're certifiable. You're welcome. I'll never figure it out. How did you do it? Mr. Manfield, I'd like a word with you. See you. I understand you visited my house yesterday. I looked at your piano. You did more than look. You have a piano at home? No, sir. How do you practice? I can't much. You're a talented musician, manfield, but that doesn't give you the right to act like a criminal. Is that clear? Yes, sir. Manfield! We'll find you a piano. Now, let me see, girls. Thank you. Just go to the back of the line. You are certifiable. What is this? Some sort of smart-ass joke? You're taking cooking! I want to learn to cook. Right. You want to make apple brown betty. What are you doing here? They wouldn't let me take auto mechanics. I didn't have time to go to the supreme court. That leaves phillips and manfield. Please, would you take the last booth? Now, today's menu is tuna walnut casserole. This may be auto mechanics after all. Take your 4-cup measuring bowl... My father thinks you're the best thing since sliced bread. That's not what he told me. A can of tuna... Don't let him scare you. You can do anything if you play music. 1/2 cup of walnuts... We're having a chamber music concert saturday. They're boring as hell. You want to come? Two stalks of celery. Uh...yeah. I'll think about it. The celery. Here. He's getting seduced by all this bourgeois crap! Fucking chamber music. It's music, for god's sake. Decadent, white-skinned privileged crap! A lot of people sitting around in ties and pantyhose, in wing chairs... -lIke your mother's. -lIke my mother's. He's not going. Says who? Says me. When did you become the minister of culture? You'd let him go if it was rock 'n' roll. You bet I would. yes. Are you out of your mind? It's not safe. He doesn't have to be on display for the entire community of waterford. And because it's not rock 'n' roll. You think you're cute, dad, but you're full of shit. Don't talk to me like that. You taught me to question authority! Who do you think you are? General patton? Why isn't school any more dangerous? Because there are 600 other kids at the school. Give me a break. You're not going! Mr. Manfield, to what do we owe this pleasure? Lorna invited me. She usually doesn't show such good judgment. There's some people I want you to meet. Sam, michael manfield-- The boy I told you about. Perhaps we can convince you to play. Well, I have nothing prepared. You were working on brahms. Excuse me. I'd like to, but I have to pick up my brother. You can play before you go. I'd like to get michael something to eat. I'd like to hear you soon. Hi, betty. So, how come you didn't want to play for them? Personally, I wouldn't consider it. You're supposed to love the stuff. Ok. It's all right. You don't have to explain. Mozart was crazy, too. You want to go up to my room? ok. Finish your milk. Excuse me. Guitar is my life. ♪♪ baum!

Is that what you're doing now? You're avoiding confrontation? Don't you ever want to say, "cut the shit"? Is michael there? I want him to play. Um...he left. He went to pick up his brother. I thought this was my room. Your mother wants you downstairs. Well, there's a tree. Mrs. Powell? The doctor will see you now. Oh. Did I leave my purse out here? Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me. Do you have an appointment? Nope. gus! god! What's cooking, mama? I can see you standing on the corner of michigan avenue-- Mexican blouse, crazy silver things. Silver earrings, yeah. Yeah. God, that was a long time ago. Yeah. How's artie? He's ok. He's great, actually. Um...he did some work in florida on a toxic waste dump, and here he organized a food co-op, and...he's trying to get his restaurant to unionize. And how's you and artie? We're ok. I mean, you know, it's... It's hard. I think about you. I think about you. Hope you're safe. How do you manage this? You got a house, two kids. It's kind of like you're leading a regular life.

Let's take a walk. I'm tired. Go ahead, paul. You haven't seen him for 12 years. You're out of your fucking mind! I don't owe you a goddamn thing! Your asshole friend here wants me to rob a fucking bank! Political action, he calls it. We've been assigned this job by the liberation army, who are under the mistaken impression that they've been supporting us and we owe them something. What do they want my kids to do? Knock off the fucking president? You want to show what you got in your car? Nothing. It's my stuff. That's not the impression you gave me. Let's look! Shall we? Get the kids down here. I want them to see. This guy's still a fuckin' maniac. Boys! Boys! Get down here! Boys, I want you to know, guns are not what we're about. Now get back in the house. You're going to change the world, artie, by organizing these little food co-ops. I'm going out. You can stay the night, but when I get back, I don't want to see these within 10 miles of my kids. Well, annie, i'd like to explain this. I'm listening. You know, we've been under a long time. A lot of bad shit's happened. A lot of bad shit keeps happening. We're dead... As far as the rest of the world is concerned. We pull an action, and they bury it in the newspapers. It's like it didn't happen. The pigs or the media only pay attention when something or somebody gets blown away. Oh, great. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Well, do you think we'll win this by turning the other cheek? Hunh! Well... Why don't you try walking on water? Try growing up. It was over as soon as the war ended. No. The war didn't end. The war ain't ever gonna end. This has got nothing to do with politics, the merchandise in my car. This is just, artie's pissed. Artie's pissed... 'cause artie's jealous. And artie's jealous... 'cause you want me. And I sure want you. That's a bad situation... And sooner or later, that's going to blow up. You know, I feel sorry for you. I do. You're a 46-year-old infant. Everything has to be your way, doesn't it? When you want it, where you want it. You're not a revolutionary. No. That requires more than playing with guns or with yourself. It requires compassion, discipline. Hey! You judgin' me? huh? No. You judge yourself, lady. You're living like some kind of silly-ass, middle-class, suburban housewife! You're living a lie... Just like you've said. Why don't you just take this little norman rockwell family and turn them in? Feds will be glad to get them. You can get the fuck out. I wish I could. Now get out. You ok, mom?

A lot of people scare me. Who scares you? People who are nice, like my parents. What's wrong with being nice? Well, let's put it like this. My mother is really nice. She never does anything wrong or mean. She even gives her old clothes to the maid, but she doesn't really want to know her. In 10 years, she's never even seen betty's husband. He waits in the car when he picks her up. Well, your father's sure not like that. Why? Because he plays madonna in class? What does he know about you except that you're good on the piano? They see what they want to see, and they block out everything else. They don't seem to get in your way. It's their way of not believing who I really am. They think eventually i'll turn back into the little girl in the picture on the piano. And what do you think? Ah...you really want to know? I think that i'll go to new york and I'll learn to write, and that I'll come home every christmas and everyone will be really polite. That doesn't sound so bad. Maybe not, but I'm not in new york yet. So what about you? I don't know a thing about you. You might as well have sprung full-grown out of the head of zeus. Who are your parents? Ozzie and harriet? Yeah, sometimes. Do I get to meet them and see how you came out so perfect? I showed you mine. You show me yours. I guess this is the end of the rest stop. What did I say?

I think you ought to make an application. I'd like you to consider applying to juilliard. Early admission. I looked at your records. You should have no trouble getting in. There's nothing in your file from your old school. It was lost when we moved. When it comes through, i'd like to see it. In the meantime, you look at that. I'd be happy to write you a letter of recommendation. Thank you. Get back to me when you've looked at it. uhh! Shh. You wouldn't talk to me. Now get up, go down the stairs, and out the back door. Be quiet! I'll be right behind you. I'm barefoot. Shh... Sit down. What am I doing? I just wanted to talk to you. You wouldn't listen the other day at school. I couldn't stay with you that night...

We put sam on all the birthday cakes because we change our names every time we move. I've been doing this since I was 2. I don't know any other way. I wanted to tell you that I was sorry. I wanted to explain why I can't talk about a lot of things like college. I can't go to college. I can't leave them, and I wanted to tell you why I couldn't be with you-- Not without your knowing. I didn't want to lie to you. I have no right in telling this to you. It's dangerous for you, and it's dangerous for them, but I'm sorry. I just couldn't stop myself. You can do what you want. Tell your dad. Anything. I don't care. I just needed you to know. I don't know what I'm doing... And I love you. I love you. What do I call you? Michael. Nothing changes. And they really don't want you to go to school, huh? We haven't talked about it. I can't ask them. Why not? It would mean breaking up the family and not seeing them again. They don't have anything else. I can't believe they want you to give up your whole life to stay with them. You know, talk to them. They'll understand. You have a lot of secrets, don't you? And now you have another one. Been to see lorna? I like that one, huh? She's full of beans. Ha ha ha. You really like her, don't you? Well, the smart ones are always the best. You sleeping with her? Yeah. ok. Go ahead. Hit the sack. You got school tomorrow. Ahem. So how long have you been playing violin after you stopped thinking seriously of piano? About five years.

New jersey? Right. We don't have all your records. There was a school fire at my old school, and the records were lost. We only moved to new jersey this year. You've only studied with Mr. Phillips for a short time? Yes, ma'am. Who else have you worked with? Oh, a lot of different people. No one important. See, we move a lot. You'll have to supply us with s.a.t. Scores, and we'll have to have those records. Yeah. Mr. Manfield? Oh, sorry. You are very talented... You know? Thank you...ma'am.

Well, you ordered one. I didn't. Will you have to pay for it? Oh, no. I'll have to eat it. Eat it? Ha ha ha! I really don't care. Hold on. Could you knock next time? Sorry. I have to go. Bye. I was wondering if michael mentioned anything to you about his old school. Not much. Why? Well, they never sent his records. so? The school has no record of him. They probably got eaten by a computer or something. They don't have a computer in blue hill, kentucky. What are you on his case for? We don't know anything about him. So he's an ax murderer. I thought he was the best student you ever had. He is, but that doesn't explain his missing records. You want to know who he is, talk to him. He's a person! He's not a computer print-out. Would you please close the door? Mrs. Manfield? yes. Thank you for coming. Would you like some coffee? No, thanks. I want to talk to you about michael. I didn't want to meet at school. He's been upset lately and nervous, and I thought maybe there was something at home. no. I know these things are private. I thought I could help. But there isn't anything, really. Maybe he's worried about juilliard. Juilliard? You know about his plans? Yeah...sure. And you don't object? no. They were very impressed with his audition. Uh-huh. They're prepared to take him just as soon as they get his records. Well, he'll have to go then, won't he? Is there a financial problem? Yeah, well, we're not the rockefellers. He could be worried about that. We always manage. He could get a scholarship. He's very talented. We don't have much, but we care about our kids. I'm sure you do. Has he ever had a serious teacher? How has he gotten this far? Well, I don't know. He picks it up. We move around a lot. Why? Blue hill has no record of michael manfield. oh. Oh! Ha ha ha! That's because he wasn't registered there under manfield. I was married before. Paul adopted him. It took until this year to adopt him legally. He's under my old husband's name. He can't finish his application without those records. I'll get them. They won't release them to anyone but parents. I'll get them, all right? All right. Now if you'll excuse me. Sure. What's wrong, mom? Nothing. Ha ha! I just love you. oh. mom. Well... Got to go pick up your father. You like it? I traded the van in for it. It's more practical. Besides, it keeps them guessing. What's up, sam? Don't call me that. ok. Danny's applied to college. Where? Juilliard. How do you know? Phillips. He wants him to go. Why doesn't he keep his goddamn nose out of our business? Because he thinks he's talented. Has danny told you about this? no. What are we going to do? Shit. Goddamn fucking shit! Why can't he go? We'll never see him again. We could arrange to meet him. Is that what you want? 10 minutes in an airport and the fbi all over his ass? You want him in phone booths like my parents, only connecting through the network? I don't think so. If he goes, we're never going to see him again, and that is unacceptable to me. I never even let myself think about this. God, I was so stupid. All I wanted was that we would be together. We should've left danny with my mother. We never should've had harry. Stop it. I can't, arthur. Look what we're doing to them. They've been running their whole lives, and they didn't do anything. It isn't fair. It isn't goddamn fair. They've taken some bumps. It won't help to beat yourself up. Look at them, for god's sakes. Look at those kids. They're magnificent. Huh? They're beautiful and bright and caring. How badly could we have done? We should turn ourselves in. So we can sit in prison for the next 15 years and look at the kids through bars? You can only get through this one day, one hour at a time. That's what i'm doing, arthur. And danny's all grown-up. We have to let him go. Ahh! This tooth is killing me. I think I lost a filling. Better go see jonah. I'll take a bus. I always worry when you go into the city. why? That's where they get everyone. It's been quiet. Sometimes it gets too quiet. Remember what you said when the kids were small? Don't worry, unless you don't hear anything. Be careful, right? Ha ha ha! hmm. I don't see anything, and there's nothing on the x-ray. I'm not complaining. You need anything else? mmm. No, thanks. We're ok. I'm working for a g.p. How about cash? ok. If you'd give me some notice, I could arrange to have more. Oh, no. This is great. Thanks. You always make me feel so guilty. why? You're living it. Yeah, I guess I am. Jonah, um... I need you to make a phone call for me. Of course. Madame? Hi, dad. I asked jonah to set this up. You can call the cops if you want to. Look, um... I'm sorry. This is hard for me, too. Will madame have a drink? No, thank you. I wonder if you'll ever know what it's like not to see your child for 14 years. dad. Not knowing whether she's living or dead. Not knowing... Whether that child is responsible for the death and mutilation of other human beings... Whether to hold yourself responsible for that death and mutilation 'cause it is your child that's pulling the triggers, setting the bombs-- I didn't kill anybody. Look, I didn't come here to defend myself or talk politics. If you don't believe by now that what I did was to stop the war, nothing will make you understand. A man was blinded and paralyzed. He wasn't supposed to be there. Don't you think I would've blinded and paralyzed myself to take that back? It's all arthur's influence-- No, dad, it isn't. It was my idea. I'm living with the consequences. I don't believe it. That's your problem. Your mother and me... Do you ever think about us? Do you really have to ask that? yes. The last thing I remember you saying to me was that I was an imperialist pig, personally responsible for the war, the spread of poverty, racism... I was young. yes. Yeah, you were young... And talented... And beautiful... So full of love. My god, annie, why did you throw it all away? Your mother misses you terribly. And danny. Will you take him, dad? He wants to study music. He's good. They want him at juilliard. Just like they wanted you. You still have that practice board? So far. Danny learned to play piano on it. So you taught him? There's some irony in this, don't you think, annie? Here you are... Asking me to take danny... Into a life... That you ran from like a shot out of hell. This what he wants? I think so. Got himself an audition without telling me. He'll need money and people to care for him. Don't you think this is too much to ask? Hardly know the boy. If we take him... There'll be fbi agents following us everywhere we go. You'll never be able to see him. We're too old for this. Yeah. I think it's too much to ask. I have another son. He's 10. Harry. Heard about it on the news. I plan to turn myself in when he's... When he doesn't need me anymore. When he's old enough. And arthur? I can't speak for him. Please think about this. Well... I should go. Annie. He can come to us. Please... Tell mom that I love her... That I thought about you both so often... And I've called out to you. I'm sorry that I've caused you so much pain. I guess i'm about to see what it feels like. I love you, dad. I saw my father. You what? I saw donald. You just walked into his office and sat down at his desk? No, I had lunch with him at la petite marmite. What for? To see if he'd take danny. Take danny? So he can go to college. You're kidding. He said he would. He said he would? Do you know what could have happened? Did phillips put you up to this? No, nobody put me up to this. It's not about phillips. It's about danny. He wants to go. He applied. He went to an audition. He went fucking where? Juilliard. I don't believe my ears. Just give him a chance. I'll see if deborah can make him up some records. why? The school I put on the registration form told phillips there was no michael manfield. It's going to be ok. He can get records in time. We're moving base camp, kids. You have a few days, and we're gone. Cover your tracks. You hear me? Do you have anything you want to tell me? no. Good. My father wants to move on. Well...why? He gets a sense. Just like that? Just like that. When? Anytime. You'll just disappear? What about us? They need me. I need you. You didn't talk to them? You can't keep running away from something you had nothing to do with. You deserve your own chance. I want to talk to you. There's nothing to talk about. You were letting your feelings affect your judgment. Besides, it's academic. Nobody will talk. You don't know that. They'll try to pick up everyone they can now. We're finished here. We can close up shop slowly, can't we? We'll have to. Otherwise we'll attract attention. Everybody goes to work and school until further notice. If there's a problem, meet at the picnic area near route 80. Stay calm. Hey, dad, can I talk to you a minute? Not now. I was thinking about staying. Don't you have school? In half an hour. I want to stay. Stay? This isn't a good time to discuss this. We can't talk now. We're in trouble here. I taught you! I taught you! We cannot break rank. A unit is as good as its weakest link. We're a unit! I taught you all of this. Don't you remember that? I don't want to hear you talking about this in front of your mother or your brother. Do you hear me? Are we finished talking about this now? Mrs. Taylor? Just remove everything and put on the gown. The doctor will see you in a few minutes. All right. I'll be right back to weigh you. Could you help me with this zipper, dear? Did you hear what happened to elizabeth powell? No, I didn't. The fbi came to see her. The car used in that bank robbery-- Where they killed those policemen-- It was rented with her credit card. Can you believe it? How could they have got it? She never even uses it herself. That's how come she didn't notice it was gone. Those people are crooks, Mrs. Taylor. They probably took her name from the phone book and made up a false card. Imagine the luck. Yeah, paul manfield, please. His wife. We're in a hurry. Gus took plastic from one of my patients. He used it to rent the car. Uh, frankie? I'm going out for a smoke. Are we in a hurry, mom? Yeah, we have to get danny. I hope your husband's all right. Thank you. Ok, let's go. Mom, I'll meet you there. We don't have much time. I'll meet you there. Salinger uses imagery in catcher in the rye-- Excuse me. yes? Mr. Mcguire would like to see lorna phillips. Did he send a note? No, ma'am. Ms. Phillips? We're leaving. You didn't ask them? I did. Artie fell apart. He didn't make any sense. Without us, he can't keep it going. He needs us to hold him up. All families break up. Why do you have to carry the burden of someone else's life? He's my father. I love you. But I have to go. I don't know how to say good-bye. Well, don't. ...had control problems. He's looking to the bullpen. Where is he? He'll be here. He's saying good-bye to his girlfriend. Jamie moyer will... He knows better than this. ...a pitching change for the cubs. We'll be back after this pause. This is bob stone with a z-90 newsbreak. New jersey police report the death of liberation army member gus winant, at large after the bank robbery yesterday afternoon. He was shot near waterford, where he had stolen a car and was attempting to flee. More at 5:00. We return you now to the ball game. Lance parrish, hitting... Get the bike out of the back. Now, get on it. What are you talking about, dad? Get on the bike. You're on your own, kid. I want you to go to juilliard. But, dad, I want to go with you. We'll see you again. You can be sure.
