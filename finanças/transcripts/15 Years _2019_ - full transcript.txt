Where is Alma? Mingling. And where is this from? The bar. I'll be right back. Hey, Whiskey... and a beer. I don't intend to get old. When we're old you can say we took the world by storm. When we're old? I don't intend to get old. Is he making you laugh, Tamari? Look at this cutie! Is this a boy or a girl? She's in a pink dress... Cynic! Thanks for the beer. Say hello to Yoavi. Say hello. I... I need another drink. What a stud! They're in an open relationship. At least that's what Dan writes on his profile. Really? Showing his face? - What do you think?! - Gossip girls! Did I scare you? Wow. I see you didn't bother to shave before coming tonight. Nor did you. I love you when you're bitchy. I love you when you're pretty. What do you think of my new dress? Did you gain weight? Son of a bitch. It's because I made you come tonight. Made me? I was dying to come. Dying to get the hell out of here. Alma! Where is Alama? "Where is Alma?" - Alma! - Here I am. I want you to say a few words. First of all, I want thank you all for coming, and thank you Dalia for this evening. It's been a long journey and I'm very proud of these works. They became my friends, my family, and my Achilles heel. And like every mother, this exhibit is very special to me, and I love it very much. Someone told me tonight that I gained weight. He is an ill-mannered savage, but... as always, he is right. So I have no choice but to admit and to share... You're pregnant! Yes. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Thank you. It's a pleasure. Thanks. How long have you known? A few weeks. Nice! - Don't you want to know more? - I'm not that interested. - Alma'le! - Hey sweetie... - Wow, congratulations. - Thank you. What a night, Yoavi? Sure, what a night. Bullshit, he's upset because I surprised him. Speaking of bullshit, you remember our procedure next week? What procedure? Something to do with her pregnancy. - Yes! I don't want to go alone, so... - So did you know about it? I'm dying for some wine. Can you please bring me some wine? - I'll bring you sparkling water. - Good enough. Can I bring you anything? We're gonna have a baby running around the house. We better lock the kitchen cabinets etc. Or lock the baby in some cabinet. I'm tired, coming to bed? Lets go. Fuck! You're killing me. Then give up. How'll you run with little boy's stroller with all the other moms? It's a girl. Liat! Liat... Ready? Let's go. Come on, old lady. I don't have time to come today. Then he can die without me seeing him. - Send this to the nursing home. - OK, they're waiting for you. Daddy... Look at this picture. I knew this was you! As soon as I saw the name on the chart, I knew. And Alam Solomon, "The black swan". I've been reading everything about you. Yasmin. From high school? Aflalo? Its Leibovich now. I knew you'd get married, I knew it! Everyone in high school talked about you, because of the... So... we're here to check the plumbing? I had to drag him. After all, he's already 42... I didn't know your mom died of a colon cancer... Who even talked about these things back then? I remember her. She was an amazing teacher. You didn't know her, right? - No. - You came after she... I'm sorry. Forgive me. Did you fast? Drink the laxative? He complained like a baby, but drank it. Men! Come. I'll prep you. Don't worry, you're in good hands. You love it when people think you're straight. No, when love it when people recognize you. Lami! How are you feeling? Wow... - What are you doing? - Nothing. Did they see anything? You have a huge tumor... In your ego. Come on. Everything is OK. For now. Stop. If they'll find something... There's nothing. If they do, I'm ending it. I won't go through what she went through. - Stop, it's not the same... - I won't die in a hospital. I've been collecting pills. I already have a bag... this big. But don't tell Dan! Promise me. Stop recording. Anyway, we're walking together, freezing our asses off, and we see approaching us an older couple. She's wearing Manolo Blahnik, with a heal like this! What a dream! For you, but she was about to twist her ankle. Her husband is trying to hold her up, and they both look ridiculous, like puppets on a string attached to a drunk operator. As they pass by us, I say in Hebrew, thinking they wouldn't understand: "What a waste, wearing Manolo Blahnik without knowing how to walk in heels". Suddenly, I hear her husband shouting back me, in Hebrew, "Yes, she's wearing Manolo Blahnik! You got a problem? This one almost died of embarrassment. Sometimes I want to punch him for the dumb shit he says. The fish is delicious! I'll have to throw up between courses. And tomorrow morning I'll be at the park at 6:30AM for a 10k. That's why you look like a model. No. It's because my husband is 27. As if you're going for a run tomorrow morning? The age difference between Dan and me is only 4 years. It's psychological. You passes 40, and he's still under 40. And it'll at 6AM for 15k! Alright, seconds anyone? Wait, I want to say something. Sit down! We all know you're pregnant. Hush up! Dan, I always hoped someone would come along and be able to handle this thing, I have no idea how you tamed this beast, but thanks to you, he shows signs of human behavior, so I want to thank you! And congratulations for your 15 years anniversary! Congratulations! Cheers! 15 years from the first date or the first fuck? In their case, it's the same thing. Only in their case? Check out what our babysitter just send us. What a cutie! Live from the bathtub. - What a cutie! Show me! - She's adorable! It's a cliche, but I already know what my next exhibit will be about. She's cute now, but at 3AM... It's life changing. Yes, I know. You look amazing! I probably gained more weight with the pregnancy then you did. OK, I want to show off too. What a doll! Beautiful! Look how she grew! Alma, when are you going to tell up what you're having? - I don't know yet. - Or who the father is? She doesn't know that either. Come on, tell us what are you having. It's obvious its Yoav. What a beautiful baby it will be? It'll be just as beautiful if it was Dan's. Of course. Maybe they mixed their sperm together. Gross. Come on, you really think so? That Yoav is the father, or that you didn't know about this? That I didn't know about this... I mean both. I've heard stranger things. Come one, Yoav the father? They probably did mix their sperm together. Did you do the AFT test yet? I have an amazing gynecologist to recommend. No, I'm only now starting my 16th week. Enough! Leave her uterus alone! Do you think that if I was the father, you wouldn't know about it? Yoav! Stay out of is! You think I don't know you're dying to be a father? Yoav... Seriously, suddenly all the babies are cute? You're either liars or blind, because the one from the phone looks like the character from The Lord Of The Rings. Enough Yoav, we're here to... To do what? Take selfies and post them on Instagram and Facebook? Yoav! To celebrate a meaningless anniversary, so that everyone thinks you have a perfect relationship? Get inside. What's your problem? 16 weeks? That's 4 months. You told me a few weeks! 4 months is a few weeks. You turned into one of them. One of them? "What a cutie", "Look how she grew". OK. OK. I get it. You lied to me. Couldn't you tell me earlier? Don't talk about lies. Your problem is you weren't the first to know. I don't have a problem, you do! Enlighten me, what's my problem? The gallery opening was a lame excuse to tell me about your stupid pregnancy. Do you listen yourself? You selfish egocentric. It's not all about you. Are you listening to yourself?! You hate that I'm pregnant because you're afraid of it. You're not only wrong, but you're as boring as those gays who have babies because its trendy. Exactly. I'm creating a family because its trendy. Family? Lami, don't use words you don't understand. It's your next exhibit. See you at the Biennial. Will you eat this? No. Dan. I have a headache. What is it? The nursing Home. Call them back, they left a few messages. Will you give this to the messenger when he gets here? Thank you. Who will help them if it wasn't for us? You give them PC names, but do you actually understand what it's like to be homeless? Is Dan Asulin here? Listen, I'm a lawyer too and know exactly what the legal procedures are. If the mayor was a good at solving problems as he is at promoting himself, we wouldn't have this conversation. OK, get back to me with some answers. Hey. What is it? Thanks for the apple. I said I'm sorry. With an apple? Or a baby crib? Alma complained to you? She didn't complain. She's worried about you. She knows I didn't mean it. Is it because she didn't tell you? No. I have no problem with that. So what? We can't talk about babies around you? Why did you say what you did? Because someone needs to say it. Suddenly everybody's interested in having babies? And if you're not having one, or twins, they treat you like a weirdo and push you back into the closet. "It's so strange that you don't want children..." Nobody said that! That's what they meant. Did you see the excitement when they thought I'm the father. Pathetic cliches! Oh yeah? Look at yourself. You love the idea that the people think you're unique, but look at the way you live. The ultimate gay Tel Avician cliche. You too, with the sudden excitement about babies. You know what? I don't have a problem with that. Do you want to have children? I don't know. Maybe. How will you find time for that? You're constantly on Grindr. As if you care. Did you get the results? As if you care. Why now? If not now, when? I'm 42. I know it's difficult for you to accept, but I really want this and I need you to accept it. I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier... but I was sure nothing will come out of it because of my age. and when the procedure succeeded I panicked. I'm sorry. And I love you... And? And nothing. Idiot. Why did you call Dan? I wanted to see what you gave him... An apple? He wants to be a father now because of you. Because of me? That's what most people want. What do you want? You should talk to someone about this. When was the last time you visited your father? Alma, let it go. Did you tell Dan about the procedure? No. I don't need the burden of this concern. You see why you need a shrink? I think I should leave him. Leave him? I treat him like shit. Then stop treating him like shit. Leaving him is the worst thing for you. Dan saved your life. What will you do without him? How will you live your life? So do I have to become a father because he wants me to? Should I have a baby because you're having one? First of all, leave me out of it. We're not the same person. Second, don't be idiot, you're not doing anything for anyone's sake. Talk to him. He's your partner. Can I spend the night? Was I not clear?! Go home and talk to him! - Here are the plans you asked for. - Thanks. And the Belgians are on the line. - What ? - The Belgians. What do they want? Talk to them. This is Yoav. Hey. You want something to drink? Can we talk? What about? About what happened. About us. - I'm really trying to talk to you. - And I'm really stressed right now. You're always stressed. No, I'm stressed now because the fucking Belgians want to me add A children's wing to the museum, and its ruining all me plans and two years of work. OK, it sucks, but you've been stressful for a while. We don't communicate and... and you're drifting away from me. Now you're blocking me out. You know what my position is. It hasn't changed. If it will, I'll update you. What if my position changed? That's the problem! You've changed. Suddenly you want... What? Dan, I do not want to have children, Not now, not ever. As far as I'm concerned, a child is like a sand clock. Every birthday, another year passes. The child is 5 years old, I'm 5 years older. - Do you realize how crazy this sounds? - I don't care how it sounds! I don't want to be attached to a child and live in constant anxiety for its well-being. - You'll be an amazing father. - I'll be a shitty father. - You don't know that. - I do know that! It's not for me, Dan. The bourgeois dream of a house, a family, a dog and a sunset to watch while growing old. - It's not for me. - Why not, Yoavi? - If two people truly love each other... - So maybe I don't truly love you. Dan. Dan. Do you realize how far you're willing to go to hurt me just so you don't have to change your stupid positions? You egotist! I've been walking on eggshells for years, afraid that if I don't agree with your ideas, you'll leave. You've already blocked Alma because she's pregnant. You've blocked your family. Your father, who lies helpless in some nursing home, and now finally it's my turn, right? I do everything, everything so we have a home, a good relationship, and I always feel that you are not a 100% committed. And that if I make a wrong move, you'll be gone. I'm sick of being treated like this. You don't see us together? Fine. Just tell me, so I know what to do next. I want yo grow old with someone. I know you hate that word, but look in the mirror, and start counting wrinkles. Don't ever mention my father in an argument. Fuck! Hello? Hey. What's up? Sorry it's so late. Yoav and me had a fight. Is he there? No, I have no idea. Maybe two hours ago. No, his phone is here. OK. Cool. Yeah. Thanks. Fuck you, Yoav. RUTH BEN-ARI. WIFE AND MOTHER. R. I. P. Yoav. Yoav! What's going on? What are you doing? Wait, what are you doing? I'm doing you a favor. Hard to believe it's your first time here. Yep, hard to believe. Yoav is a master in compartmentalizing. So are you. Why do you think so? I haven't been here until now.... Do you know how I envied you both? What? I envied you a little, too. You know, I first met Yoav in school when I was 13. And he was the only one who looked me in the eye. As if to dare me to look back. And all I need is a good dare, I wouldn't stop looking back. That's when he realized I understood he was different. And I was as different as could be. Two outsiders. Do you know how many kids he beat up for me in school? Not that he opened up to me so easily... And even then it was fleeting... but when he did open up... He thinks I betrayed him. Yes. Yoav. Are you there? Yes. Am I interrupting? No. How's the pregnancy? Fine. Moving along. Do you need anything? I need to know what's going on with you. Alma, what do you want? Why are you such a SOB? If you need anything specific, say it. I don't need anything. Go back to your cruising. Don't pretend to know what I'm doing. So tell me, what are you doing now? What are you doing? It's not your business. You're not my mother. I asked you if you need anything, otherwise why did you call? I called because... I don't need anything. Do your thing and we'll talk some other time. - I don't to talk another time. - So what do you want?! I want you to not be pregnant. Can you make that happen for me? I'm gonna get a beer. Do you want one? Yes, get me another one. Excuse me. Excuse me. Ignoring you, huh? Completely. I'm Evyatar. Dan. We've met. We didn't really meet. OK, Eli? - Unbelievable. - Thanks. OK... so now we're meeting. I almost got hit by a car because of you. You should have looked at the road instead of at me. I waited for you to look back. I only looked back is to make sure the car didn't hit you. Right. Where is my beer? I hate you. You just became a bachelorette, and already you're picking up the cutest guy here. And you gave him my beer. I hate you. Tell me everything tomorrow. Let me get you another one. It's OK, let's share this one. Thanks. Do you want to go outside for a bit? OK, cool. Come on. So... a bachelorette? Yes... 4 months. What? I don't know. You still love him. On the one hand it hurts, and you feel paralyzed, but on the other hand you find yourself moving on. Are you for real? How old are you? 27. How old is he? 40. Plus. How long have you been together? 15 years. A long time. Are you? I mean, were you... Yes. After a while, especially this long, most couples come to some sort of agreement. A verbal or a silent one. I think I didn't really know him because of all the silence. Maybe that's how he wanted it to be. 27... And you? 38. Sexy. So, what do you do? Do you go to school? I'm a waiter in a cafe by the Bima, and I'm on a break from school. Psychology... Medicine. A doctor who serves coffee... - Wow. - Yes. You should switch to psychology, you're very good at it. Do you want to go somewhere? Take out your phone. Call me when you're ready. Yes, I know. I know, it's... What happened? We can stop working on the museum project, and make sure someone cleans up this mess. Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? I came to pick up some things. For the office. Where is your key? I didn't want to use it. OK. Come up. I'll just take a couple of things from the bathroom, and I'll be out of here. No problem. How was your night at the bar? Just asking. That's why you're here, to snoop around. You waited for me so you could find out what happened. - What happened? - You want to know? Be specific. You be specific. You want me to be specific? OK. I met a sexy guy, who's not afraid of who he is, who doesn't hate himself, doesn't block out his loved ones, and who doesn't snoop around other people's lives. And he's hot. And young! Specific enough for you? - Did you have sex? - Are you fucking kidding me? You're an idiot for coming here, and I'm a bigger idiot for waiting for you. You think you're the only one who can block people out? Here, take this shit and get out of here. Get out of here! Are you coming from base? No, free transportation for soldiers. How old are you? 19. You? 42. Usually they lie to me. It doesn't matter because I'm attracted to old men. OK. You should have continued. Why? Do you want to die? Don't you? Excuse me, Evyatar here? Yes. Evyatar! Hey, what a surprise. Can you put this in my office? Thanks. Are you busy? A little. You? A little... How did you find me? You said a cafe by the Bima. How many can there be? Four. Actually, I tried that one, but the guy there is not as good looking. And at the cafe over there the guy didn't even remember me, the son of a bitch. So, you're not a waiter? No, I'm part owner. You know, until I get into psychology school. You're ready. And assertive. I just stopped by, I have to get back to the office... Right, office. That means you also have a job. - Yes. - What do you do? I'm a lawyer. Oh, Suits etc. You probably look important and serious and all adult like... Go on, I'm not offended at all... I mean you probably look sexy wearing a... I want to see you. You still have my number? I already have a bag... this bag. I've been collecting pills. Gur? Yoav. What are you doing here? My office is here. Right. How are you? OK. How is... Eldad? No, I mean yes, but the... The one from The Lord Of The Rings? Look, I'm... Forget it. Do you want maybe to grab a beer together? A beer? No, I don't feel like grabbing a beer with you. I'm going home. Eldad and Liat are waiting for me. Liat... I won't keep you. OK, take care of yourself. I tried to call you a few times. Call me back. To delete the message and go on to the next one, press... Yoav, I left you lots of messages. Call me. Yoav, call me. It's urgent. Yoav, when you hear this message, call me, we need you. To delete the message and go on to the next... Yoav, I'm... I'm a mom. I had a girl. Fuck! Damn it! ...and may he rest in peace and let us say amen. Amen. Kaddish. Glorified and sanctified be God's great name throughout the world... Amen. In the world which He created according to His will, may He bring salvation and His Messiah... Amen. In your lifetimes and your days, and in the lifetimes of all Israel, swiftly and soon, and let us say Amen. May His great name be blessed forever and ever. How are you? - Working today? - No. Come in. How is Noami? Naomi is good, about to go to university. The fact we're not in touch doesn't mean I don't know what's going on with you. Both of you. Why are you here? Because I want to. I came to the Shiva twice. I wasn't there. Anyway, I'm very sorry for your loss. No need to be. Are we ever going to be friends again? I don't know. Why are you doing this? I don't know. Do you really think I'll give up on you? - I don't know. - Why are you running away? I don't know! Well, I want to know! Because I'm jealous. I'm jealous you're a mother. That you're capable of experiencing love. Enough. Can you see how many people love you? Look around you. I'm devastated from loving you. Dan never stopped loving you. Everyone wants to either be with you or be you, so what are you talking about? Yoav, you are a part of my life and it's not going to change. Come on in. - Did you put enough parsley? - Put down the lid. And get the hell out of my kitchen. Assertive. You're not the first one who says it. You've become quite a chef. Six months. I'm a quick learner. Cheers. Dan... I do love you. I mean, of course I love you. I just can't go on living like this. How? In fear. Of what? That you'll leave me. - Yoav, I'm not... - That I will leave you. What do you mean? You said yourself that I block out anyone who needs me. - My father, Alma... - I don't need you. Are you afraid of letting me down? I think we're beyond that. Forget this. It's nothing. It's really nothing. Because I love you. Do you smell something burning? Shit! Damn it!
