St. Anne's Psychiatric Centre "All rubbish, All The same. Leave me alone." "All rubbish, All The same. Leave me alone." Calm down. Be a good chap. Drink some more.. Come along now. Doctor, I wrote to you, I can't stand it any longer. You have to... You have to understand. Of course, Madam, of course. I'm not like the other women. I know. I'm not like the other women. There was a time when she was like the other women. Now we can't do anything more for her. Once again, we've intervened too late. It's strange... Nowadays, with mental disorders... ...shame and social taboos wreak the same havoc... ...even in matters of physical medicine... ...as they did in the Middle Ages. No one dares speak to us about it. Most of the time, it's not thought about. Right now... ...I have here a case that's particularly symptomatic. Although there's nothing exceptional about it. We regularly encounter women like this. She came across to those around her as being the image of a young woman who was smiling and happy. I can't reveal her name. Let's call her Claire. However the sickness had been with her a long time. A terrible, insidious sickness... ...and all the more cruel, being secret. Do you remember a news item, without apparent importance... ...reported a few months ago on page 4 of the newspapers? It related how one morning early... ...in a busy little street of a working-class neighborhood... - Good morning, Mrs Martin. - Good morning. - It's alarming. - It's just beginning. We'll really enjoy ourselves. Get everything ready. I'll get the car. - Andre! - Yeah? Can you help Clara pack the suitcases? One doesn't close properly. Do you have a strap? - Thanks. - 'Morning, gents! - So, is this the big start? - It looks like it. Ready? Well... almost. They make a tune out of it, like usual on your work-sites. We'll never fit everything. I can't close it. So what do YOU want? Me? Nothing. Tonio sent me to help you. I don't need any help. Is this the one that won't close properly? I don't need any help. You don't refuse help from a friend. Is that the way we'll be travelling together? Can't you speed it up? I'm doing the best I can. Are you going far? Southern Morocco. Some people don't worry! I'll say... I've got 18 months to laugh about it. - Building another dam? - Yes, a big one. - 5,000 workers. - What will you be doing there? Slave away. He's no not the first. - How much do I owe you? - Come in and I'll tell you. - Get a move on, eh? - Yeah. Well? You'll be sunbathing, old chap. It won't hurt you... You look pretty anemic! Thank you. See you, Robert. See you next time. Clara! Clara! Andre! Andre! Here's the strap. Something's happened to Clara. - Serious? Get the doctor, quick! Clara... Clara, my little girl... Why? Why did you do that? Why? Why did you do that? Why? This way, doctor. He asked me for a strap. I was finishing dressing, and I was getting ready to go... We have to get her to the hospital. They were about to leave for Morocco. Raise a little to the right. Compress. Some clamps. You've seen the x-rays, gentlemen. Let's not waste time. So, do you want some or not? Are you in a hurry? What is it today? - I don't have my card. - That's twice. I lost it. Stamp on mine. You'd've made a fortune in the subway. Hey... Are you naked under your dress? Come and see, if you're interested. So, are you set? - Ciao, guys. - Ciao. Hey! Not that way, Miss. It's mined! Come back! It'll explode any moment! [Italian] 4 Calvados and 2 half bottles. 4 Calvados and 2 half bottles. Three reds. Hey, Sebastien, you look all in. Leave him... He's had enough. I believe I ordered you a red. And I believe I refuse. You already owe me more than 3,000 francs of your pay. Enough. You're a bunch of shits. Just wait till I get away from your goddamn dam. You going back to Canada? Don't bother with him. Why wouldn't I go back? - I never said anything. - Why not go back? I'll tell you why... 'coz he's never been there. I ran the largest sawmill in the Far North. 2,000 workers under my orders. Canadian workers... they count double. Leave him alone. Oh, are you defend the oppressed? - What about the menus? - You needn't shout! Let's go. - Where are the menus? - They'll get married. Good on them. He's her boss... he's marrying her. - And the menus? - In the drawer, at the back. What are you drinking? Look at this... It was my mother's. - What are you drinking? - It's for you. You don't owe me... Ah yes... 300 francs for the demijohn. The demijohn? It broke because of you. And I'm not including the glass. If you like... on Sunday... we can go to the village together. No. No dough, no booze... You understand French? A litre of red... with a cork in it. If you're going to go on getting on my nerves... [Italian] Miss... Go to the other side. He's under your spell and it makes him dumb. He can just sit over there. If only I could tell you... ...just what my heart desires... You still wouldn't like to hear... ..about my pain and torment. I saw your lips were parted... And yet your heart be shuttered... I can still feel a kiss's flavour and the fever of my love. Are you going to bed or not? It's been a long time. You can come. We'll take a dive. It's not my thing. What isn't? Swimming? Prowling around men's barracks at night. Between us, Clara... What's the point of this life? Every day the same as the last one. Want my opinion? It'll end badly. No kidding? Work that out for yourself? I'm just saying. Listen Margot, my dear... This is what I think of men... Go sleep somewhere else! - Arsehole! - Scram! That's why I'm changing. I love my freedom. "Your freedom"... Don't make me laugh! You aren't as free as he is. You'll go to Canada, too And where will you end up? Getting married? You'll marry your boss, like in Ginette's stories. Actually I won't. She's gone back to her van-driver boyfriend. She'll go on being the slave of a guy until he drops dead. - Won't bother me. - Don't let the girl hear that. What's up with her? Just a screwed-up bint. Can't you stop reading?! [Italian] [Speaks in Polish] Hey, he's there now, in Canada. A conscientious worker... a boss respected by his subordinates... ...loved by his friends..., His whole life was devoted, even in its smallest moments... ...to a great and noble cause... his work. And booze. Yes, my brothers... he gave himself body and soul... ...to that admirable work which, by its magnitude... ...and by the magnificence of the way it soars... ...may be compared to a medieval cathedral... It's not the height of luxury. - What are you doing here? - Nothing. Hold on... What are you doing with that? - It was Sebastian's. He told me... - So you say. - I swear it's true! - She could be right. Did anyone ask YOU? Be polite. He's replacing Sebastian. - So what? - I'll tell you WHAT! Let her be... She's just a kid. So long as she plays with dolls, she won't be a problem. You eating at the site? I can't. I don't have a card yet. This one time, I can give you credit. Thanks. - See you, boys! - Goodbye! Adios, gorgeous! [Italian] If you want to play whore, I've no objections... But not on my work-site, understood?! If I see you prowling around here during work, you'll be in trouble. Shall we do a round of shooting? I hate firearms. What are you doing here, all alone? I'm recovering. I've spent everything on the "Mont-Blanc". Mr Tonio not coming? No. He doesn't like crowds. I'll buy you a ride. No, me first! - I can't. I've things to do. - You don't know how to do it. That's not how to do it. You still mad at me? No. Why are you looking so angry? Here... you have to wring it out first. Oh, it's not even rinsed! There... Why aren't you at the fairground? I hate crowds. It's true. It's no joke. No more? Nope. That's all for today. Fine. That's it. - Goodbye. - Ciao. No more need of me? No thanks. Then I'll be going. Sure. Goodbye. Take them in this evening, in case it rains. You never know. Yes... that's true. The weather's changeable. I'll say! The other day, when... Say... don't you want be nice to me? That depends. For the help I gave you with your laundry. Keep talking. I'd like... I'd like you to take me in the cable car. What cable car? The one used for materials. I know it's for the workers, but you're the site boss... It's a promise. But it'll be for another time, since it's Sunday, ...so its not operating. Okay, but it won't be difficult to make it go... ...since old Justin's on watch and he has the keys. It's amazing. It's like the "Mont-Blanc" only better. The "Mont-Blanc"? It's a merry-go-round. I didn't think you went to the fairground. I was lying. I came up on purpose to come and see you. You can't have known what affects me. I know you don't care. If I annoy you, I can jump. Calm down! Yes, Tonio. Look... the next dam is going to be built here. Down there? How beautiful! It's marvelous! Come on. I've never been here. It's pretty, isn't it? Why don't you say anything? Wouldn't you like us to be friends? Yes, I couldn't ask for more. You say that, but you don't seem to feel it. You wouldn't understand. Explain it to me. I'm not very smart... but I'm willing to learn. With us, in Italy, when a girl comes on to a guy... I come from a village in Tuscany. It's wild there. The people there are primitive, pretty simple. So, when, "a girl comes on to a guy..."? Well... that's a long story. They're not all that simple. You see, you don't want to understand. It's you who doesn't want to understand. You don't want to understand that I like you and that... Is that how it is? Yes, of course... well, partly. Well, go on... I mean to say, that physically... But it's not just that... there are inner feelings... - In there. - Eh? A question of mentality. So you don't like my mentality? Oh no, not at all. I don't like easy girls. You sound like a priest. Maybe. So what? Very well then, let's go. No, Clara... If we're going to make speeches we should stand up. But no, I just wanted to say that... Don't you think it'd be better if we kept quiet for a while? Go back to the fairground! Down there, guys are waiting for you. You'll be spoiled for choice. And you can go back to Italy! This damned heat! Another day of this and I'll join the Eskimos. In 19 years, I may've seen 3 days like this. A guy almost fell from the footbridge on site 6. Cut it out! Is the heat making you jumpy? Like with animals. When there's a storm in the air, it drives them crazy. - It's bucketing down! - Sure is! Get us a bottle to wash it down. Lightning struck the storage building! Hurry up, guys! It's on fire! All foremen to the office! All foremen to the office! All foremen to the office! The fire's centre is here. The explosives are stored here and the wind's blows this way. - We have to get the boxes out. - The regulations forbid... If it blows, there'll be no one to obey your regulations. We can't get through there. It's all on fire. How do we do it? First we have to get out the boxes and then we'll see. Get hot coffee made, to serve on the spot. There's still one more! Hey! Marcel! Grab him! You have to get out, Tonio! Out of my way! I'm getting the box. There's still one more. Tonio's gone in for it. You okay, Matey? Nothing broken? The flames could be seen from Sanary. How could it have burned like that, with all the rain that was falling? You're in a happy mood! Yes, you may be right! Ginette! Take these cards to site 6. We forgot to distribute them yesterday. I'll go. Disasters work for her! Pass me a 22 spanner. I'll go get one. So, things looking up? - They could be worse. - You're in a rush, eh? Ciao, Tonio. You OK today? I told you I don't like whores hanging out on my work site! They called from Sanary. 40 guys are coming to lunch. We'll need to set up the spare room... What's up with her? - Where's Clara? - Site 3. She changed. - Clara! Clara! Clara... Don't blame me for this morning. Tonio, I... It was just I was so furious because of last night. Furious with me? No. With myself. - At that moment. - Why? I can't explain. When I found myself stuck with that box... I really thought I was a gone for good. So it's odd... I started thinking about you... Which was strange at the time. What I mean is... It was as if that was what was most important. And then, this morning, when I woke up, when I realized that... Well, there'd been no miracle... I'd had my turn... like the others. Tonio! No... I know what you're going to tell me. That's the way you are. I'm different. That's all. Things don't mean the same for you, as for me. That doesn't mean I'm right. It's just that... Anyway... goodbye Clara. I said to him..."Sir..." I brought back the litre that I borrowed from you. Okay... Put it on the counter. I said to him, "When you have a business..." Have you heard the news? - What news? - Tonio's leaving. - Really? - He's taking the 7 o'clock bus. - What was the matter? - I don't know. A good guy. I'd've been surprised if we'd kept him long. - See you! - 'Bye. Yeah... Tonio! Tonio! How can you possibly be leaving? This morning, you didn't let me speak. I... I wanted to tell you... I wanted to tell you that the others mean nothing to me. They never did! It's just you, Tonio. You've been the only one. Thanks. You have to believe me. It's true, Tony. I swear it's true. So, that it for today? You can't leave me on my own! Compress. Forceps. Compress. Clamp. Compress. Pressure. Six... four. It's going down. It's normal. Be quick. - Good morning, Mrs Borelli. - Good morning, Mrs Martin. - It's going to be a 13-storey building. - That'll liven things up. It'll make a lot of shade. Good morning. The empty lot, facing your house... It was bought by a company. A litre of milk. Thanks. The boss still asleep? Yes, I'm giving him breakfast in bed. They're cute. We were cute at their age. Are you up already? I wanted to serve you in bed. Oh no... that makes me fat. And lying around? No! Listen... - Tonio... - Yeah? Look at me. What? Stay there, you'll see! Wait a bit! Wait, you'll see. Breakfast is served. You're going to be... Later! It seems that the vacant lot across the road has been sold. - They're going to put up a building. - Your book! It'll be 8 storeys high. This morning, we don't have much time. - There'll be elevators. - So? "Where are the 3 erasers and 4 pens that we lent yesterday?" Dove sono le 3 gomme... - ...i 4 portapluma... - Penna. - Penna. ...che abbiamo prestato... - Prestati. - ...prestati ieri? There'll be garages as well. You have to work more seriously. Look, it's difficult. Difficile. Molto difficile. At home, in Tuscany... ...they won't think you're my wife if you don't speak Italian. - Really? - Oh yes! They're like that. For them, you'll be a foreigner. I'll apply myself. Io molto lavorare. Next week, when I'm in Orleans... ...you'll have plenty of time. So take advantage of it. You should work... ...up to here, eh? Si, signore. Are you going to stay long? Oh no! 5-6 days. I'm just a replacement. 6 days is a long time. You see, in Italian, there is a saying that says... [Italian] So, lessons are over, eh? Hello. - Greta... - Isn't awake yet. Seeing as you haven't had your coffee... I'm useless. How do you know? Are you any better after your coffee? Funny. Wait till you see the young up-and-comer whom I stumbled upon... Millions at my fingertips. It'll change everything. I'll give him 3 months training, and... You haven't changed. You neither. You're still a beautiful chick. Tonio hit the jackpot with you. Drink your coffee before it's cold. And then, nice, obliging... ...loving to serve... ...everything, eh? - Oh yeah. Great chance... Mirliton in the second. He's got 100 metres in reserve. And in addition... Don't you dare wake up Greta to scrounge from her. - It's not your fault. - She's nervous. - But at 8 to 1, that'd be stupid. - Sure would. Here... there's 200. I'm telling you... For nothing, love takes fright Thank you very much. ...and suffer the pain Don't play with my heart Shut up! Can't we sleep anymore? [Speaks in Polish] What time is it? Forget it. Did you get my milk? I'll bring it over. Last night, at the club... ...a man came to find me in my dressing room. He said "I saw you dancing. I think you're talented. I've never quite seen the like." I realised, I know! But it was still nice to hear. The best thing about it is that he's an impresario. He offered me a great contract. England, South America, and finally, Hollywood. - What do you think? - Where are the matches? Where they always are. Thank you. Andre must be happy. Mmm... That one's never been interested in my career. If I were a horse, maybe. Or a boxer, even. But dancing... He's not an artist. - Not like Tonio. - You know... Italians have it in their blood. You don't have a swimsuit to lend me for Sunday? - Sunday? - We're all going swimming. - Take mine. - What about you? Now that I've been noticed by an impresario, I've other things to do than trapse around with broke people. What happened to the other one? He's working. Your right, kid, like this! One, two... Three! Lift your guard! Where's the sunscreen? Raise your elbows! If you forgot it... Learn to talk French before yelling at people. Away you go! Here you are blondie... Here's your diesel oil. Andre, you wouldn't have spotted a shady spot? Yes. Over there are pretty tables with nice aperitifs. I've nothing AGAINST sunburn, but I've nothing FOR it, either. - Come on. - OK. You think they would do sports, or gymnastics? No. They have to hang around in bistros. Just speak for yours. They're all the same race, okay. Do you think they do any exercise? They just want to sprawl on the beach. - What are we drinking? - A martini? Two martinis! Excuse me, Miss... You wouldn't have seen a large gentleman wearing red shorts? What else? Hair rollers? No. He's bald. Yes, Venice is pretty... But Florence... Ah, Florence... Were you there long? I don't stay anywhere... I just move on. Surely you stay somewhere? Why must I? Time to lie down for 5 minutes. - That can happen. - There, you see! Why don't you just keep quiet? Me? I was just asking. No! What are you sulking about?! - The bill. - What's up with him? Is it because I was dancing? Have a drink and get over it. You don't dance... but if it bothers you... You don't spoil the evening because of that, right? I have to get up early. I'm no manager, I work. Okay. I don't give a damn about hanging out in bistros. I find that adorable! Ouch! You hurt me. The bill! Is 6 early enough for your train? You taking the small suitcase or the big one? Hit me, but stop scowling. I can't stand it. Too bad for you. What's got into you? Oh, nothing. You leave tomorrow for over a week... We can't even have one evening... Oh well, if that's what amuses you! You crazy, you almost... You had fun. You thought you were back at the dam, having guys groping you. - Tonio! - Shut up! I knew I'd married a... Don't you want me to forget it? You've no right. Should I be embarrassed? Go to bed and I'll pack your bag. Pack your own would be more like it! Meaning? Meaning... Meaning that I'm fed up. Fed up with all these men who... How many were there? Eh? 10? 100? 1,000? I didn't keep count. You're wrong, Tonio. You shouldn't. My God, so it's my fault? It's there, in my head, and it won't go away. And every day it haunts me. When I see you tonight starting again... And it doesn't take much to get you going back to it... One drink, a little music, and away you go! But tell me that you think about it... you too, while you're doing it. Tell me that you haven't forgotten and you regret it! It's not true, Tonio! If I hurt you, I never intended to. I've no reason to. You're too unfair to me. You shouldn't suspect me the way you do. I'm your husband Clara. Exactly. It's because you're my husband... ...that you should protect me. Against what? Against myself. So you admit that you stayed being a whore? Clara, forgive me. Don't blame me, Clara, I... I get to a stage where I don't know what I'm saying. I didn't really think it. I swear... ...that I wasn't thinking it. You shouldn't have, Tonio. You shouldn't have said that. Oh, Clara... Stop! You don't want a rematch with my new kid? I'm a bit bored... You can send your terror to me. Now you'll see something to behold. This guy's going to be a champion. Go! Cover yourself and keep your distance! Go on! Just wait till you see his lightning right. Get up, for God's sake! Hey... You're wanted on the phone. Millions at your fingertips? You'll never change. We've seen the ultimate wipe-out! Shut your face! The only annoyance, is that it wasn't the one planned. Shut your face, I said! I need to reflect. No, but look at him... That's more of a reflection. No, I do believe I have to drop him.. No kidding! I have another one in my sights... a little Moroccan... a tornado. Really? Well then, I'm going to tell you something... If you only have tornadoes to feed you... ...you won't be eating often. What do you mean? You two aren't any fun... Do you think it's fun supporting a hopeless twit like this? Listen... Don't like it, you can leave. Oh, just wave your hand! Really? Lazy, good for nothing! [Speaks in Polish] Hey, don't you have a dictionary? There's the dictionary! Good... You asked for it. Come on Clara. Hey! Another half. Well, this is where I'm going. The station's on the corner. Where do you work? There... at the back. I've never seen you dance. Like tonight, I'm all alone... You're kidding? No, why would I be? You... But... You can't come in like this. It's a classy place. No one will see me. Ladies on their own aren't allowed in. Why not? I promise you... another night... Greta, why are you dawdling? Get to work, doll... to work! A new girl? Mmm... Nice little piece. You don't seem to be afraid of the competition. Why couldn't you have left 2 minutes earlier? You wanted to see where I dance? Well, look, here it is. This is the stage. Not very well lit... but that's what's wanted. As for my number, it never varies. Always the same steps. To the corner, there, then I leave. The "asphalt dance", it's called. I really wanted to be a dancer, at one time. But Andre is the only impresario I ever met. A pimp. Stay away from here. It's no place for you. You got yourself a decent guy. You don't know how lucky you are. Time to go... I'm due on stage. Can I do the room? Hey! You're bright and early this morning Mrs Borelli! Still on your own? When does the boss get home? I had to ring like that... I thought you'd still be asleep. You off to town this early? - Like a coffee? - If you've made it. I was just about to. Heard the latest? That bitch Greta didn't come home. - Oh? - Well... It doesn't seem to surprise you. No. How come? To do this to me... after 4 years as a couple. Tonio is lucky. He doesn't have a girl who'd sleep around. What? Out of my way! You seem very jumpy. Is something up? Not at all. You were saying about Greta...? After all the sacrifices... All the money spent on dance, for her to have a job... a future. The result... She takes advantage of a quarrel over pennies. Stop with the bullshit! Excuse me? I knew you were pathetic, but not a pimp. That's not okay? No, it's not okay at all... Greta told me everything. You disgust me. You disgust me, you hear? - Get the hell out of here! - Fine then! Listen, it doesn't work for you to get home at at 8am. You should rest a bit. So... coffee...? Ready? I jest! I watched for Greta at the window... and it's you I see coming home. Well, it's none of my business. Only, you're in no position to teach me morality lessons... Are you? Best I go get my coffee at the bistro. Sorry to bother you. "And do-it-yourself... "...it will always be do-it-yourself", I said. Well, they asked my opinion. Only, just between us, I'll tell you something... If the Morocco job holds up... ...I'll ditch them and sign with Panzini. And how! Don't I get a hug today? Not exciting anymore. Can you see us together, in Morocco? All expenses paid. A real vacation. Morocco has all the advantages of a colony, without... Coffee's ready. - So what's been happening here? - Nothing much. I saw that they've started the earthworks, across the road. - Did you work at it? - Yes. Where were we up to? No... Here. "Paul and his cousin Marguerite came to visit us..." "...on a beautiful spring day." Paolo e sua cugina Margherita sono venuti a visitateci durante una bella mattina di primavera. [Italian] At this rate you'll be giving ME lessons! Off to work. Come on. Where do you come from? I never saw you round here. Well, look... I'm a bit short-sighted... Can I take a closer look? That can be arranged. Hey, there's a tasty bit of crumpet! I wouldn't mind meeting her in a corner of the woods! What did you say? I can't hear anything, with that noise. I said "I'm not a bad guy." If she wants to regain her freedom, we might as well part as good friends. Poor Greta. I'd really like to see her. Me too. But like I told her... "In life..." It's not the same for you. How will you get on now? You have, as it were, lost your job. You'll have to register for the dole, eh? Pass me a cloth. Something wrong? What are you doing?! I've always been crazy about you, Clara, and you know it. - I don't share your feelings. - We're birds of a feather. What are we waiting for? We're made for each other. But let me go! You hurt me. You must be nuts! No kidding, what do you think? - You're usually less difficult. - Meaning? The first guy to come along... I followed you and I saw you. One more or less... ...what the hell does it matter? Mistake. Not just anyone. I choose them. I can happily do without dirty little hoodlums like you. Don't I have that right? If the dirty little hoodlums like me... ...set about telling what they know... ...you mightn't be so uppity. Clara! Clara, are you here? Clara! Hi, Andre. Big news, children! Aren't you pleased to see me? I've given my notice. - Don't you want to know why? - Yes... why? I've signed with Panzini. We're moving to Morocco. Some news here, too. What? We'll tell you. You'll find it oddly interesting. What's he saying? I can't hear. Well, go ahead. Tell. You'll see, you'll like it very much. The setting is beautiful... in the heart of the Atlas Mountains. Our company has built 70 villas reserved for staff. Each one with 4 bedrooms. - That's more than we'll need. - Thanks. One day you'll have children. Men are funny. There's one more thing that I want to ask you. Go ahead. I'd promised my mother I'd come to Italy to introduce her to Clara. - Nothing easier. - In 2 hours by plane, you are there. She's been learning Italian just for the occasion... - so it would've been a pity... - Not possible! Parlate italiano, signora? Excuse me, I have a migraine. I'm going home. - Don't bother. - I'll come with you. I'll take a taxi. I hope I won't be needed. Good evening. It's you? So, do you still want me? It's okay, on one condition... we leave tomorrow morning. Wherever you want. I'll work for you. I'll bring you more money than Greta. I'll guarantee. Give me time to think... Tomorrow or not at all. Got it? Got it. Tonio will be home any moment. - Won't you tell me who it is? - You don't know her. And how much will it cost? A thousand. She has nothing. The trip has to be paid for. I have to get her started. So, she's a novice, as well!? In a manner of speaking. Let's say she's a virtuoso who doesn't know the ropes. Only, she doesn't know how to organise herself. And that's where you come in. You should be happy I'm getting back on track. When you left, it was a blow, you know. Ah, I was not a pretty sight. Stop, or you'll make me cry. Is it Marcelle? Albert's wife? No! Suzanne... The little redhead? I'm telling you... You don't know her! I hate to help people who I don't know. It's Clara. What?! She's crazy about me. She wants to go away with me. - It's not possible. - Signed and sealed. And when I tell you she's good... ...trust me. I know first-hand. What about Tonio? Tonio's wrapped up in his projects. It's not possible! You're not going to let me down? It's the chance of a lifetime. A girl like that and it's London, New York... my dream. I wasn't meant to be a cut-rate pimp. You won't let me down? Remember, we've still had some good times, together. Don't bother! Tomorrow morning, I'll bring you the dough. So it's true, then? You can answer me. Andre asked me for money to go away with you. I got it. But I want to understand. There's nothing to understand. I just can't go on. - You know what Andre's like... - Yeah. Exactly what I need. It's better for Tonio too, that I leave. I realised that last night, all of a sudden. We were at a restaurant with his new boss. We were making plans for the future. Talking about having kids, would you believe! For God's sake, explain yourself! I've always been like that, Greta. Up at the dam site, it seemed natural to me. When Tonio took me away, I thought it was over. Well, not at all! It wasn't over! I also believed that I would chose. But it's not true! I don't choose! Not even the time. I just obey. The world may collapse. It's all the same to me. No, don't touch me! Let go of me. I'm ruined I tell you... Rotten to the core. I'm so angry, Greta. A pimp's the last thing you need. PSYCHIATRIC CENTRE We can eliminate the diagnosis... ...of a psychotic condition evolving. We can also reject manic depression. It's a characteristic form of nymphomania... ...exhibiting neurotic and compulsive traits. Nymphomania sounds nice... ...but where does the illness begin and depravity end? There are symptoms that don't deceive. She's not an accomplice to her impulses... She's the victim... and knows it. Is it a mental illness? Obviously. At the time of crisis, control is entirely abolished. But it's mostly about consequences. If the illness isn't treated... ...more serious disorders are to be feared. Come with me, my child. You've no reason to feel ashamed... You are not guilty. If you had been a victim of an accident... ...it wouldn't be your fault. Well, it's the same. As you've very well understood, there are two women within you. The real one, who loves her husband. And the other one... The difficulty is that the other is the stronger one. Alone, you can't fight it. But with our help... ...you'll manage to get rid of her. I'll give you a note for one of my former students. He's in Morocco, in Rabat. Dr Sicot. Go and see him as soon as you get there. The change of atmosphere will be very favourable to this treatment. What about my husband? Don't tell him anything yet. Later on, I'll talk to him. I'm very happy. Just like that... you'll leave for down there...? And Andre? I'll take care of it. Don't you worry. I know how to talk to him. Get everything ready. I'll get the car. - Andre! - Yeah. Would you help Clara pack the suitcases? - Yes. One won't shut. Do you have a strap? - Thanks. - Hi, gents. - So, is this the grand departure? - It looks like it. We'll never fit everything. I can't manage to... You? What do you want? Nothing. Tonio asked me to help you. I don't need any help. One won't close. Is it this one? I don't need any help. You don't refuse help from a pal. So just like that, you head off? Andre, listen to me. I shan't tell anything, if that's what's bothering you. But I've got the right to laugh... ...because the doctor story that Greta told me... I've never heard anything so funny. You're ill. We'll give you injections, and you'll be cured. Leave me alone! All kidding aside... do you believe that crap? Please leave me alone, Andre! They made fun of you. I know that illness. Will you be quiet! You have debauchery in your blood. A tempest in your body. - Needles won't... - Are you going to shut up? Needles won't help. You'll carry on until Tonio's fed up... ...and he'll kick you out. Down there, there's no choice. Just the brothel. 100 francs a time. There. Leaving Sainte-Anne, she'd regained her confidence. She must've flinched at the last moment. You go and see him... he'll explain better than me. I understand quite enough. - I know it hurts, but... - Get out! Get the hell out! I see what it is. I'd've done better to close it. I don't want to see her... ever again! You possibly won't. Maybe we'll never see her again, Neither you..., ...or me... or anyone else. She'll be fine. Clara. Clara... My little girl... My little girl... Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
