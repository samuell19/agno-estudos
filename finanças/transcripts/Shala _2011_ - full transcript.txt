Fall in line...come on... fall in line. What's going on? Stand in the row properly.. ..if you don't.. ..I'll set the most difficult paper this semester. Each one of you would flunk for sure. What you laughing at? Have I cracked a joke? Good morning.. Sir! Dear students! A revolution has started in our country! It is the revolution of discipline. Some people are trying to spread terror in our great country. Nobody wants discipline. Nobody cares for regulations. But.. ..when we look around us.. ..take Germany for example.. ..or look at Japan's progress. We can see that discipline has worked wonders for them. Even our country will progress if we are disciplined. Discipline has to be followed everywhere. At schools.. ..at home.. ..on roads and railway stations and bus-stands. Discipline should be our way-of life. Then it will be a win-win situation for all of us. Joshi! So let's sing this song.. ..which is as inspirational.. ..as the National anthem and get inspired. Joshi! What is it? What is a state-of emergency? How would I know? 'We shall overcome!' 'We shall overcome!' 'We shall overcome!' Aren't you writing this down? Isn't anybody here yet? What a hottie she is? That's Sakhardande! Check her out... nice. If she were studying in 9th grade with us.. ..then I would have gone for her. Then would you have forgotten Kevda? You don't understand! My love for Kevda is evergreen. But she should respond! Who's there? Nobody! Dude, are you done with your homework? What! Did she even give us some homework? She had asked us to work on the.. ..word-meanings from the chapter Robin-Hood. Holy crap! My lunch wasn't ready! Forget the lunch. Work on your homework.. ..or Bendre is gonna spank you man, bigtime! Look at Randive sir! Dr. Evil. You little scoundrels! Phawdya! Are you nuts? What if he would have come up? Useless! Seriously dude! My dad gave us this place to study. If something goes wrong here, my dad will kill me for sure. We don't want trouble! Let's not kid the teachers' anymore! Hey Chitre, your gal is here. Who? Kevda! Oh Kevda! My love. Dude, introduce me to her! I will owe it to you for life! Oh my love! Kevda! Someday, you'll be in big trouble for this. What time is it? It's 11.40! Let's go! Are you guys done copying the homework? Where did Robin Hood live? In the jungle. Talk to me in English. In the phorrisht. Well, it's not phorisht. Say forest! In the forest! Ya ya... As if you were a born American. What's so important, Mr. Jangam? Nothing much, I was just informing that.. ..headmaster will be attending tomorrow's assembly. Fools! Sir! Please come. Please take this class. Quiet Please! Hang on. Is it history class? No! Still, I'll take the class. Ms. Barve is not keeping well, so I am just filling in for her. Let's take a break sir. Give us an off. No! I am not giving you any break... pull out your textbooks. Sir, please! - No! Let's consider this as an opportunity to get done.. ..with our history syllabus for the mid-terms. Holy Crap! What's wrong? History is past. I know it is necessary and all that jazz. But I am thinking of the future, man. How is the future going to shape up for us? Us? Whose future? I am talking about all of us! Joshi! What is going on there? Where is your book? Nothing more than Geography.. ..Public administration and History is worth teaching and studying. Anyways, mankind has a tendency to pick up languages. All other subject are worthless. Worthless! That's not true. We are expecting uncle Naru to arrive day after tomorrow! Awesome! Then we are going to the watch some English movies! Do you even understand English movies? And let me also remind you that you have to study for your exams. I will make an offer that you can't refuse. What's that? I hope you still want to be an engineer! Mukund, listen to what your sister has to say! After your mid-terms you we have to look.. ..for a tutor so that you could start studying. The world knows what your school has to offer! I don't need your advice! Did you see that? He is taking everything for granted. Only five words...only five. Didn't I tell all of you to.. ..complete your homework? Show me your book. Show it to me, right now! Where's it? How many times one has to tell that Bibikar to get a sleeker cane? The next break I will go ahead and break that cane. Mhatre! Show me the homework. How many word meanings did I ask you to bring? I had said five words! How many are these? Ten. You think you are very smart? Nobody tries being smarty pants with me. Show me your book. Who has done this? I did it. In that case, tell me the meaning of the word...gallant. You just said that you did your homework. So tell me the meaning of the word gallant. You lied to me. You lied...you lied. Have a seat, Mr. Manjrekar. Thank you, sir. There is a district-level conference. Teachers from reputed schools will.. ..share their teaching experiences. I feel that you should represent our school. Thanks for trusting me. Be well prepared. Yes, sir! There's something else I need to tell you. Be seated. I am not only extremely happy to have a teacher like you.. ..but also it is a matter of pride to have you working with us. In spite of this.. The other teachers complain that you consider the subjects you teach.. ..to be much better than the other subjects. You mock other subjects in class. You know I don't mean it. It's just a joke and the kids enjoy it too. That's it. Not everybody understands sarcasm. You have to be sensitive towards others feelings. Sir. And we're holding a prayer assembly tomorrow. Hope you remember. Yes, sir. 'We shall overcome!' 'We shall overcome!' 'We shall overcome!' 'We shall overcome!' 'We shall overcome! Someday..' 'Someday..' 'O...o...deep in my heart..' 'I do believe..' 'We shall overcome! Someday..' Tell me who needs independence? Trains are running on time. Tasks are completed on time. That should be enough And what about your rights? Everybody in my office at the Municipal Corporation comes on time. Uncle Ponkshe.. ..when it comes to time, why does our.. ..working class keep on procrastinating? That discipline will surely be maintained. It's difficult... it's difficult. Mukund! There is no point in arguing with you. Oh! Mukund! I think I saw you near the village lane. Everything is just fine. In fact better than before. By the way, I enjoyed the cup of tea. I had been to the public library. Is that true? He was just trying to impress the girls there. Mukund, tell me the truth. You were trying to impress the girls, weren't you? No! That's crap! Mukund, just wait! We will play a game of chess. What were they saying? Why do you care? Chitre explains it much better than our Professor Redkar. Instead, I feel such peace when I think about Kevda. And when will you copy the homework? Take a chill pill! I will get that done in our Hindi lecture. And the rest of the homework? Let's see. You are so unlucky. What if Kevda were studying with us in ninth grade? You may laugh at me but I swear to lord that.. ..I would have made her my girlfriend! Well then it's easy, you just have to flunk this year. Phawdya! You scoundrel, I'll bash you up! If I flunk my father will kill me. Forget it. Tell me if she were studying with us what would you have done? I'd have just starred at her without a care. That's not a smart move! It is an art to stare at the person you love. Not even your sweetheart should come to know that you're staring. Even when our teachers are in class.. ..you should be able to look at her.. ..from the corner of your eyes. My uncle Naru told me about it. Now we must keep a watch on you to find out who you look at. Isn't it? No. I keep away from trouble. What a mess with these notebooks? Cover your notebooks using brown paper. Believe me I will look through every notebook. Well, open your books. Lesson number 3. Whether it was a delay in preparing food.. ..or forgetting to iron clothes.. ..papa used every opportunity.. ..to express his impediments. Joshi! Are you paying attention? Give me the meaning of 'impediments'? Teacher...impediment means.. Obstacle. Hmmm.. Sit down! Impediment means obstacle. Don't forget that your mid-terms are approaching. You want to do that? Wait...let me help you with that. Joshi, I got slapped because of you! You rascal... why are you blaming him? Nobody had asked you to tease the teacher! Well, Mr. Kukarni suggested the girl for you. How are you Mukund? Uncle Naru! I wasn't expecting this as an answer. How are you? Fine! Say it properly. Say I am fine. The person talking to you should really feel that you are fine. Fine! We need to be aware about the girls when it comes to an arranged marriage. She is not fine. Let's go for a walk before dad returns home. It becomes practically impossible to get hold of you.. ..once you start chatting with him. - Okay. Let's go. Where are you going now? We are going to take a walk. - Be back in time for your meal. How are your friends doing? They all are doing well. But tell me why didn't you like the girl? How many girls do you plan to meet? She was like a typical aunt. I am hoping to get a girl with some western influence. They are so smart, have such stylish hair and are so feisty. Awesome! Please do so! Try and look for such a girl. Propose to her...have an affair with her.. ..and don't tell anybody other than me when you have a fight. Let me meet her once or twice before you get married. She'd be Christian.. ..and after the wedding.. ..I'll mock my mom and sister telling them that.. ..I knew the story even before they heard it. I bet their faces would be worth seeing. Young man, are you in love? What? - Do you like somebody? I don't get into that kind of trouble. What's the time? We must go home now! Mother is going to cook something nice. Let's Go! Hey, Misal, don't you find English difficult? Yup...what makes you ask? Nothing as such. My uncle teaches English at a college. That's why English is easy for me. Listen. Can you show me the well near your house? Yes. Whenever you want to see it. How about today evening? - Just come. And yes don't worry about English... I will help you out. Joshi seems to be impressed by you! What do you mean? Take down these 5 points. Greetings, sir. Be seated. You have a new girl in your class now. Her dad is transferred to this place. What's your name? Anita Ambekar. Good Morning, sir. Who is your class teacher? Madam Paranjape. She will take a note of it. What a babe! - Continue with your class. Please be seated. In which school were you earlier? Saint Mary's, in Bandra. What? Where has she come from? Bandra. It's a very sophisticated town in Bombay. Convent school? Yes, sir. Take a seat. Hi! Okay, where were we? Huh...where were we? Tomato rupees three a kilo. Make it 2.50 paisa. Well chilies, cilantro, ginger and curry leaves.. ..everything is for a rupee. Your mother gives chilies and stuff for free. Make it another 0.50 paisa. The total is rupees three. That lady was bargaining a lot. Tell me about it... but I tricked her as well. I am not even sure if a kilo of tomatoes are worth 3 bucks. Ok, now I gotta go... I had a nice time. What's the hurry? See Shirodkar coming in this direction? What veggies are you selling today? Well...I have fresh gourds. Don't buy the beans. They are not fresh anymore. Okay...so give me half a kilo of gourds. ..and a kilo of tomatoes. What are you doing here? Me? - Here...take this. How much do I pay for this? Rupee one for the gourd and rupees three for tomatoes. Give her one rupee back. Okay. Misal, you stay pretty far away from the school. Do you have any kid staying around, from our class? Not a lot of people. It's just that Shembekar who stays in the next lane. Why do you ask? Not for a reason...generally.. And Shirodkar stays a little ahead from here. Where are we going? I thought you wanted to see the well...where else? I was thinking about that Shembekar! Every class has one such person.. ..who is the target of all the teachers. He is cool with me. Shirodkar stays here. Namdar Gokhale lane. What? What time is it? - I've no idea. My father had asked me to work on something.. ..and I totally forgot about it...I gotta go. And what about the well? We can check it out later, it will always be there. And don't worry about English...be cool. I will help you. Pictionary! Pictionary! Girls vs boys. How many times do they want to humiliate themselves? This word.. this one! Okay. Let's start. Who's coming first? Ladies first. Come. "Thamb Laxmi Kunku Lavte". "Thamb Laxmi Kunku Lavte". Too good, Ghasu...too good. "Jab Pyar Kisise hota hai" With whom? Is it Mahesh? "Bambayi ka babu". "Kati Patang". Joshi! Put on a tough name. Crap! There is no such film. You would be the first one to watch it, when its released. Joshi! Don't be smart. Girls...can you guess this one? Who is coming next? Crap! What the heck is this, Joshi? Are you sure with the word count? It is right, sir. Joshi! You gotta keep up to your reputation. "Jal bin Machli Nrutya bin Bijli". What just happened? Nothing. Rain drops are falling on my head. Enough of this game. Take out your books. Dude, why don't you ask him some intelligent question? Sir, what do you mean by the state-of-emergency? Fantastic! Well done, Joshi! Well, there's at least one boy in class to ask this question! So what is the meaning of state-of emergency? The state-of-emergency means a crisis. When a state-of-emergency is declared in a country.. ..it means it's a difficult time for the country. That's just an excuse. Actually, emergency means impeding.. ..the rights of the citizens. In a way, I am also working for the government. So this is all I can tell you about it. But why is emergency declared? To discipline the people of this country. That's right as well. But the reality is to suppress the rising dissatisfaction in the people. In short, the ruling party is aware of its reducing popularity. So they are afraid of the people. They are afraid of the fact that people have the power to.. ..throw away the existing government. Thus, they try to suppress the people. The state-of-emergency is called "The era of discipline". Obviously they will insist on it. This provision works in the favor of the ruling party. You are still young for this. Don't think a lot about it. Continue studying.. ..and score well in your exams. But in the state-of-emergency people lose their freedom of speech. Exactly! That is known as the state of emergency. I feel like winking even if there is no girl around.. ..when I have these gooseberries. Whose bicycle is this? It's Ambekar's The tyre had a puncture. She had asked me to get it repaired. Puncture? Do you even know the word used for puncture in English? Puncture is called puncture in English. It's time to go now. Misal swear, why did Ambekar ask you to do it amongst all of us? Puncture is puncture. Well, looks like madam's bicycle. I had asked you to get your English books covered using brown paper. So leave your notebook on your desk. This is not brown, it's yellow. It is brown, ma'am. Am I a fool? Stand up. Is this brown? I got it with the books. Don't argue with me. Tell me if this is a brown cover or not? Cover it up with another paper tomorrow. My father stayed up late and covered it for me. There is no reason to cry. Get a brown cover tomorrow. If you don't know what a brown cover is, try asking the shopkeeper. Okay, lesson number 9. Mhatre, listen. Will you do something for me? The laundry guy at the corner, will you please take care of him? He whistles at me when I am around. Rascal! You trouble the girls? No...I don't! You trouble girls! I will smash your face. The Hindi script is very similar to Marathi. Isn't it? Yes! Then, why does Hindi seem difficult than Marathi? Why don't you ask the teacher? Joshi! Fool! Miss Bendre is going to kill you! Take out your books. Also I want to see the homework I gave last week. Who wrote this? Who wrote that? Somebody has to confess. I do not want to punish the whole class. We will be punished unnecessarily. Who has written it? I wrote it. Come here. Come here. Put up your hands. Both hands. So I am a dictator, right? This is how a dictator would behave! Take this and this. Go back and sit in your place. You should be ashamed of your act! Kids, nobody has to know about this oil. Nobody has to know that I was involved. We must register a complaint with our principal. Surya...why don't we all do it? What is the use? Our principal is not different. What kind of a school is this? You are just kids. Why do you get involved in this politics? Who told you about it? Check! But can you see how severely he is beat up? Father, you must go and meet the teacher once. No! We are at fault, aren't we? Then we have to bear the punishment. Play on.. This takes courage... ..and this topic is so complicated.. ..that a government servant cannot go beyond his limits. Check and mate! But will you go as a government servant or as Mukund's father? You did a great job! Too good. With best compliments from me. You can take it back later. The hunter killed the lion. Give me the answer. The lion killed the hunter. Crap! You killed our hero! The lion was killed by the hunter. Write it down. Crap! Why has Joshi asked Misal to come here? It's fine. It's only until the mid-terms. Hear this. There are two types of animals namely invertebrate and vertebrate. The invertebrate animals are subdivided into ten sub-types. The first sub-type is Phylum proto-zoa! Phylum protozoa. Hey you Phylum protozoa! Make sure that your midterms would go well. No. The English word for is easier than the Marathi word. Isn't it? Phylum protozoa. Phylum protozoa. When is the exam? When is it? When? What is this crap for final paper? That's true, feels like we are sitting on the road. Tie up your answer-sheets. Cheers to Marzini Garybold! Long live the French Revolution! Cheers to midterm holidays! Rascals, meet up sometime in the building. What do you want? A new movie in the afternoon? Which one? James Bond. Diamonds are forever. You had promised me that you'll show me a movie. Okay, a promise is a promise. Let's go. Awesome! Isn't it late for a movie? You won't get tickets. Don't jinx it! We will figure out something. Let's go.. Diamonds are forever. The 'R' in the end is silent. Diamonds are forevah. Diamonds are forevah. Let's go! Oh my god! Is that you, Joshi? You have come for the movie, right? Obviously.. How stupid of me! Have you bought the tickets? Nope. And who's this? This is my uncle Naru. She is from my class, Geeta Shenoy. Greetings! Wait up, let me see how I can help you. Mahesh! Two more? She is pretty sly. What nonsense! She and Mahesh are going around. Your nephew teases me a lot at the school. This is not good. Is that true? That's okay. He knows so much of film trivia. Nobody can beat him at it! So what? She doesn't care... that's why she could make it to the movies. Don't you talk like that! This is Mahesh. Hi! Glad to meet you. Wonderful, Mukund, return her the money. It's hot so let me get us some ice cream. That's fine.. We just had a cup of tea. I am not listening. So did you spend your vacation studying? No. How about you? Initially I was traveling.. ..but now onwards we have to start studying. I haven't started though.. Here, my friends! Bond. Naru Bond. Can you repeat the dialogue for me? I tend to notice little things like that. Whether a girl is a blonde or a brunette. My friends would never understand this dialogue. But I don't agree with the fact that you tease this girl. Who? Sukdi? You should actually help her. In spite of the pressure from her home and school.. ..she dares to love this guy. I admire her. Well don't ever forget that.. ..our society progresses because of such bold people.. ..and not because of nerds. If people like you trouble them, it just won't do. Think about it. If you fall in love and everybody teases both of you.. ..how would you feel? Hey, Joshi! Pingle! Why haven't I seen you this year? The school is pretty far away.. ..so now I am attending Subhash school. And what's this? I had to take a tutor, Mr. Deshmane for English and Math. I am not planning on a tutor at all. Already there is a lot of pressure from school. Does anybody from our class attend his coaching centre? Nope, nobody from our school. Here you go. Oh...yes...that Shirodkar and Mande both of them attend the class. We start with a triangle named A B C. Understand? Now dissect the triangle with a line. Call it B E. Why aren't you writing? I know this one. Then why did you join this class? My sister was very adamant about it. A B C D will be equivalent. I take your leave, sir. How come you thought of taking a tutor? I found a convenient batch. Hey, Joshi, I thought you never wanted to take a tutor? I wanted my sister to stop nagging me...she forced me. Your friends from the school must be coming at the learning centre. There is not a single boy from my class. Anybody from our class attends the learning centre? Nobody. May be few girls from our class. But I couldn't see them properly... the room is crowded. Who recommended you to Mr. Deshmane, as a tutor? Joshi, are you falling for somebody? If somebody from Subhash school does then it will be good for me. Are you just having fun with your friends at the tuitions? What kind of fun? There is barely any place to sit. Your girl is here. Oh my Kevda! How do I woo you? I told Chitre that she is from his caste.. ..so he could introduce me to her... but he keeps on ignoring me. This is what I call a rebellion against the state of emergency. Mukund, you? What are you doing here? Me! You didn't come for the coaching class today, right? No! Sir taught us well today. Don't bunk the classes. What makes you write with your left hand? Gandhi! What? Ambidextrous. What are you saying? Gandhi was ambidextrous. He wrote using both his hands. I think studying and getting good grades should be enough! That's it! Can you come to the Ganesh temple at 10 am? Please dispose the letter once you have read it. Hey, Joshi! You required a grammar book, right? Here it is. Okay! Here it is. Rice, lentils, onions, potatoes, chili powder, salt.. ..vessels, spoons, bed sheets, blankets.. ..sweater, knife, rope, torch...got it? Give me that bag, I'll put it all in. And what about stuff like tea and sugar? What is this? I am just asking since you have to go for the camp. Teachers would be arranging it. And don't forget to bring back the torch.. ..and get the vessels too. Yes. Remember to get everything back. What time are you expecting the bus? Thank you. Today, I am ready to travel up to the border of this country. It would have been fun if Surya and Phavdya would have made it. Didn't they say that they find the scout too pansy? Now they have to suffer... and we will enjoy! Totally! Excellent! Very good! Good work! Scouts are always prepared! Later start gathering some wood for the bonfire.. ..or you will have to clean the dishes as well. Clean them well. Don't just splash the water. This is fun! We have teachers around but no classes and stuff. All the lady-teachers are comfortably chatting with the male-teachers. And now even the girls have started conversing with boys. When? Didn't the rude girls thank us after we gave them our seats? What was that? You want to share it with me? No! You enjoy. Good going, brother. What're you doing here? Me.. Hanging around. I need to talk to you. About what? Can you make it quick? I really like you. Can I see you here again, tomorrow? Nope.. I cannot do it. Joshi! You know the answer? I am not playing. We are going to defeat you guys today! Losing feels so good, doesn't it? Of course it's healthy. We should do this every day. Joshi, you rogue, why don't you spit it out? We'll lose if we don't get this. Joshi, give them the answer. We know why Joshi is quiet. Is it? Hey, Bibikar, stop bothering Joshi. Why do you care? Why do I care? He is my friend. Stop messing with him or I'll smash your face in If you have the courage, fight me alone. Don't depend on him. Enough is enough! Time to go home. I need to settle scores with that Bibikar. He wasn't lying. Just because she is your girl you kept quiet and we lost. Nothing like that. - You think we don't understand? Sir's mother has been admitted to the hospital.. ..so he has declared holidays for the next two days. Are you looking for somebody? Nobody.. Just casually looking here and there. I'm leaving. I am going back home. Finally Juvekar let you go, eh! Yes, but Mande wanted to come with me to my home. So then? Then...what? Got my way out...eventually. I am so glad that we have a holiday Right... but we will miss a lot of studies. You know how difficult Math is? Where is this going? What do you mean? I mean our future.. I have no clue. I think you look pretty in this dress. This one! But it's way too old. We shouldn't be standing here. Can I leave? Wait up! If you go before the class gets over.. ..then your mother would doubt you. Doubt? What do you mean? I will tell my mother that the class was cancelled. And if she asks what were you doing all this time? I will tell her that I was chatting. With whom? What do you mean with whom? First with Juvekar and then with you. Can you meet me tomorrow? We don't have a class tomorrow as well. I cannot make it tomorrow.. ..and let's not meet up here. Then where do you want to see me? Can you see me at my home? Home! So what? We can chat at my home. Nobody minds when my sister's friends.. ..come and chat with her. So are you going to come? Alright. Can I leave? But do you know where my house is? I know. I start missing you once I am back home. Is there anyone else who would like to.. ..participate for the chess competition? Joshi, enroll your name too. Don't you play really well? Let it be! Who is interested in facing those snobs? That Bibikar considers himself as Bobby Fischer.. Just defeat him. Ma'am. Joshi is in. Why are you speaking on his behalf? Can't he speak out? Check and mate! Very good. Wow, Pawar! You took five wickets and all of them clean bowled. Congratulations! I'm clean bowled now. What did she say? Mirikar! Mirikar! Go home! Mirikar! Mirikar! Go home! Joshi! Joshi! Joshi! Will win. Joshi! You gotta win this game. Your bishop seems to be in danger...check out my knight. Crap.. What am I doing? Concentrate and play well, you fool! Can someone call her boyfriend Gokhale? What should be my next move? Move that pawn, which will either.. ..make me lose my knight or the bishop. This is allowed I guess. Girl, enough now! How many times he has to save you! Check and mate! Joshi won! Joshi! Joshi! Joshi! Joshi! I am truly happy when the tournaments are going on. No school...it�s just fun. There should be a kind of school, where there are only sports.. ..tournaments, competitions, games.. I would go to such a school only. Let's hurry! We should not be late for the Kabaddi game. Did you meet Surya? It's a girls Kabaddi match. Surya would be the first person who would be seated there. Very nice...very nice. Applaud! Hey, Mande Wow! Mande plays well. I swear.. She seems to be passive in the class. Do you know what do I dream for? A girls vs boys, Kabaddi match to be organized. What fun! We shall overcome! We shall overcome! We shall overcome.. Someday. Deep in my heart.. ..I do believe. We shall overcome someday. We shall overcome someday. Mom! Joshi from my class has come home. Didn't I tell you that he is good at that game.. ..where we have to think of names of movies? Oh I see! Did you have a class, today? No, I have to give to my classmate Misal. Well...do you want to have some tea? Yes...but don't bother. Why not? Have some. Do you want to take a tour of our garden? The shrine you see here is almost 50 yrs old. Here! have a look at this snail. Let's not hurt it. Do you want to take some flowers for your sister? No! She is not very fond of such things. But you look really pretty with those flowers. Here! Have a look at this. Don't forget to give Misal's book. Here's some tea. Have some cake as well. Why do you need those boxes? We always have to move because of her father's job.. ..so we need to pack our stuff. Have some cake. There is not a lot to see around.. ..so I have decided to go to the Ganesh temple every Sunday. Read all the questions following the lesson.. ..and answer them in your homework. Do you understand? If any of you have any questions, ask me right now. I have heard, she goes to his residence.. ..to solve her doubts and stuff. Sir! These girls are talking about you and me. Who? Those four on the first two benches. I didn't say anything...I swear... I didn't...I didn't say anything. Please be quiet. You sit down. We shall study the 14th lesson next time. Types of environment. What time do you have, my dear sir? - Uncle Naru! May I know what time do you have, my good sir? It belongs to father. Favor Luba.. It's suave! Uncle Naru is getting married. What are you saying? Julie...Helen...or Jane? Where did you meet aunt? Don't go too far in this heat. I am planning to get married after your exams. Wonderful! But you were going to marry a western girl, right? This is for you. It's the Beatles. This is John Lennon. Let me quote him. John Lennon says.. "Life is what happens to you while you are busy making other plans." And where do you want me to listen to these songs? K. T has a cassette player. Forget that. Tell me, do you have a girlfriend? Nope...nothing of that sort. In that case, I will help you out. If something works out, I'll surely tell you. I'll remember your advice, be undaunted. Are you sure? - Of course. You said it, not to fear anybody. I've no fear. If need be I would leave home. Take up any job, but I will not quit school.. ..instead would opt for a night school. Yesterday afternoon. Hey fool! Tell us properly. Ambekar's family had gone to watch the film 'Sholay' yesterday. And she consumed a bottle full of sleeping pills. Holy crap! But why? Look at the courage she showed, man! She wrote a letter saying.. "Prof. Manjrekar doesn't love me, so I'm committing suicide!" The door must be locked from inside. Ambekar is still in the hospital. Yesterday even the cops had come. What fun! She boldly showed that she loved Prof. Manjrekar. She had even told him that.. ..the girls in the class were teasing her. But what about Prof. Manjrekar? Ganoba told me that the cops have arrested him. Crap! What do you want? Nothing.. Let's go. But I am still thinking... what they must have done? Why are you so interested? I am glad that today, your friends didn't turn up. I was sitting in the last row and.. ..I immediately left once the tutoring was over. I felt very bad about Mr. Manjrekar, didn't you? He was our favorite teacher. Not was, he still is. Why should Ambekar go for sleeping pills? I don't think this is the right spot for us. Then where do you want to go? Nowhere. I want to go home. My folks want me to become an engineer. Then what should we do? Tell me. I mean what should we do in the future? What? I mean what should we do in the future? My mother must be waiting for me. I gotta go! What's your name? I am Mukund Joshi. I wanted some information about the courses held.. ..for 11th and 12th grades. My cousin was interested. Where does he stay? He's in the village. I mean you.. Where do you stay? Near Dheparwadi... in Kudalkar chawl! Oh, close to Dr. Majkavkar's clinic? Yes! Currently you are studying in which grade? I am studying in 9th grade at Warhadkar High School. I mean your cousin. He is through with his 10th grade. Why don't you ask him to come? Do you offer Science as a major? You have to get home. It's getting late. To hell with the state of emergency. Object the government laws. What fun man! These pamphlets are pasted all over.. ..including the station. The cops are tearing them all. But who put these up? Maybe some brave people. This should happen.. ..if I would have known this, even I would have written something. The cops would have put you behind the bars. Look at that! Surya, if you are wise enough tear it off. Your dad would think you have done it. Yes! But how? - Idea! Come here. Sit down. You climb on him. Slowly. How did they put it up so high? - Just quit it! I am dying. Let�s go, guys! Down with the emergency! No dictatorship! Give it to me.. - What do you want? I need the newspaper. Who do you need? - Where do these young boys stay? The ones who arrange meetings and stuff.. What are their names? K.T Dhavde, Vijay Deshmukh and Ashok Sutar. There are no meetings held here. Uncle, mind your language. We are from the police department. Well, if you are cops then get information from your sources. They were arrested yesterday. We have to search their rooms. Which is their room? Do you have a search warrant? - Yes, we have it. We have a key to their apartment.. ..you can be a witness to this. So what is it that you are looking for? We are just doing our duty. Why didn't you get one of those boys with you? Those boys went against the government.. ..thus they have been taken far away. They've been arrested just because they condemned the government. What are you planning to do with them? Why do you come here so early? It's better than staring at my father's face at home. Pull out your chemistry book. I had a dream last time. What did you dream about? Me and Kevda are walking together to school. We pass this building and were laughing and talking. Chitre, Phavdya and you are looking at us from the window. I, too, look up at you guys unhesitantly. Then I catch hold of her hand and she blushes. But I don't remember a thing after that.. Did you dream about her at the crack of dawn? It is believed that such dreams come true. What's the point of dreaming? Why don't you talk to your uncle Naru about it.. ..and ask him to suggest some plan. A plan that would make Kevda fall in love with me.. Surya! Why don't you propose to her? "Kevda, I think I am falling in love with you.." "..do you care about me as well?" And you'll get to know what she has in mind. Crap! Joshi, look at that. It's Kevda. Today she has come early. And that too alone.. Joshi, you keep on saying that I should propose to her, right? Well, let me do it now. No. Why don't you complete your chemistry homework instead? To hell with chemistry! Today, I am going to ask Kevda out. "One who is scared is dead!" Come along, now! No! Surya leave me. Come on it was your idea! Just come and stand besides me. No! - Don't say no! You can't back out now. Let's go. Surya, let me wear my shoes at least. Hey! Will you be my girlfriend? No! Is that your answer? - Not a chance! Let me go. She says no. Forget it. She's gone. Let's go. I don't feel like attending school today. If your father comes to know about it he will kill you. Forget it. Don't bother. Why are you taking it to heart? You are doing just fine with your love. Nobody cares about me. Surya, let's go. Today's difficult word is.. Excuse me, ma'am. Mhatre and Joshi. Come. Surya, we are in trouble due to your yesterday's deed. Ganoba, why have we been summoned? Let's go. You will get to know soon. So these are the boys? Who stopped you from going? You step forward. Step forward. What did I do? You ask me what you did! Come here! What did I do? - Rascal! You dare hold a girl's hand and are asking me what you did! I didn't hold her hand. - Shut up! Don't utter a word. Now you come here.. - I didn't do anything, sir. What was he doing there? He was accompanying him. So an accomplice.. Come here hold your hand up. Why are you scared fool? You enjoy being a vagabond, right? Show me your hands! This guy was behind her since a long time. Once he had also followed her all the way home. Isn't that true? These boys meet up on the building and tease everyone that passes by. Especially girls. I am a witness to this myself. This is news to me, about my own students. If this is the way the boys would behave.. ..how do we send our girls to the school? Aren't you the son of Mr. Mhatre? See! His father is one of the donors of the school. And look at his misdeeds! Don't just say, act on it! We have to punish them. Punishment? Rusticate them from the school.. ..and ask the police to take them to the juvenile correction centre. Call their parents. Write them a letter right now. Call them here at 11 am tomorrow. Mr. Gupte, you should be here too. I will be there anyway.. But what's the point of arranging a meeting with the parents? Hand over this matter to the police. Ganoba! Go and sit in the class. Ganoba will bring you the letter. What happened? - Tell you later. Tomorrow their parents have been summoned. That should make some difference in their lives. We can't predict today's kids.. True. I'll check everybody's homework and then begin the next lesson. Okay? Some of you are trying to be over smart. What do you think, Joshi and Mhatre? You stop girls on the road, and propose to them! Is that what we teach you here in this school? Excuse me, ma'am. Headmaster asked to hand over these letters. Mande! Start reading lesson number 10. 'Remembering Trishna.' 'A boat was hanging on to it.' 'To my young eyes it seemed very beautiful.' 'The pebbles on the shore were so slippery, black and cold.' 'When I took one in my hand, my eyes fell on another.' 'And the other one looked even better.' Mother, are you listening? What is it? Listen to what your young prince has done. What is it? Nothing much. The principal has called father to school tomorrow. Tell her the reason. You misbehaved with a girl and.. ..that's why your principal wants to talk to father. I didn't do it, it was Surya. I was just standing there. Scoundrel.. Is that why we got you admitted to school? Have a look at this. Terrible misbehaviour. Tell me what you did exactly. Surya stopped a girl, Gupte, studying in eighth grade. She got pissed on him and told her father about it.. ..and then they registered a complaint at the school. Where did this happen? You know the location of Mhatre's building, right? We all meet there and go to the school together. Why do you have to meet-up there? To make fun of the girls! - Don't talk nonsense! I don't think she is lying. 'It has been brought to our notice, that your son, Mukund Joshi..' '..has misbehaved with a girl-student. 'You are requested to meet the headmaster regarding this..' '..tomorrow, 21st February at 11 am.' Fantastic! Serious misbehaviour! What did he say to that girl? He proposed to her.. Oh my god! Now you have crossed the limits. You are still very young to fall in love. Do you even know what it is to fall in love? Do you consider yourself the Romeo from Romeo and Juliet? Since I have to make it at 11 am, I will have to take a holiday. I'll write an application. Go and give it to Mr. Chandorkar. Go and get some paper. Accomplice: Partner in Crime. I don't understand what's going on with Mukund? He is not afraid of you. And that works to his advantage. We have to work out on this before it gets too late. He is in bad company. I had already warned you that this is not a good school for him. After all the schools are the same.. - Nobody wants to study. This school is all about it. Next year he will go to the 10th grade. If he continues to behave like this, how will it work? I don't think he'll become an Engineer. Both of you calm down. Nothing has happened. Boys from this age group will misbehave. It's not a big deal! Go back to sleep now. Mukund! Come here. Well, Mukund, I need to hear the truth. We were studying. Surya and Phawdya were playing mischief. But, father, she is lying about him catching hold of her hand. Surya did no such thing. Surya just proposed to her.. ..and since she denied he walked away from her.. ..and now they are saying... - What? And they are saying that they will hand us over to the police. No. Stop crying. Stop crying. Now I am here. Stop crying. Is the principal in his office? Stay here, without a word. Let's go in. The headmaster is calling. Already I have spanked him a lot. If you want, I will do it in front of you. No. Forget it. - Can't let this go. He dares tease girls! I'll kill the rascal! Beating doesn't help. It just makes them adamant. They should be handed over to the police. Only juvenile correction homes will help them. Mr. Gupte, do you consider our kids as underdogs of the society? If these boys misbehave with the girls.. ..what are the girls supposed to do? Just a minute. I am not justifying the boy's action.. ..but he didn't catch hold of her hand. Ask her. Tell us the truth, girl. Did he catch hold of your hand? Speak the truth. - No. Did he keep his distance while speaking to you? He didn't hold your hand. Maybe he didn't do it... but isn't that the same? Nope...it's not the same. The boys have committed a mistake. But we must understand them. He proposed to her and she denied the proposal. That's the end of it. Has he troubled her after that? It's not easy as you are putting it down. Absolutely right! But there is no point to keep talking about it. They are going through puberty... they are bound to commit mistakes. That doesn't mean we should put them behind bars. Go and wait outside. I spoke to my father in the evening. And he started beating me. He almost got me killed. Luckily a customer came to buy some gravel. But once he came back he continued hitting me. Mother tried stopping him but he kicked her too. My uncle came then. He held him from behind and saved me. Mr. Mhatre. You shouldn't have hit him so much. What should I do? Last night, I just lost it. He's my only child. I have never been to a school. At least he should get an education. But he is involved in such activities. He will learn. Try talking to him, only then you can make him understand. Your boy is very courageous. Don't be mad at him. Otherwise, eventually you will lose him. Mukund! Go to your class. And don't concentrate on anything else except studies. Remember a mistake cannot be forgiven each time. Joshi! It was your advice that proved to be very costly. What happened? Nothing. Tell me. Joshi, I think, I will have to quit school. Why is that? Mom says that we won't be staying with father anymore. We will go to the city and stay at my aunt's place. "The tears of blood have long since dried." "I still long to hear the sound of your voice." "Songs of glory echo all around the temple" "The one that links love, peace and compassion is God.." It was that day I realized.. ..the true meaning of school. I see friends here, boys, girls, benches.. ..teachers, math, geography and even social studies. But I am nowhere in all of this. I am just like that.. ..free white bird roaming around freely. Even when I am sitting in my regular school.. ..my mind wanders into my own school. Into my loneliness. This school of mine has no classes.. ..no walls, no professors, no blackboards either. But the education I get there is much more beautiful. Take it easy. It will get stuck in your throat. What's the hurry? Result. Many students have fared much worse than expected. Don't you people concentrate on your studies? You are going to be in the 10th grade next year. Keep it in mind. The boys' results first. Bibikar stands first. Congratulations! Gokhale stands second. Surve stands third. Dashrath stands fourth Joshi stands fifth. Congratulations! Wow! Chitre stands 11th. Harishchandra has flunked. Mhatre has flunked. Misal has passed. Pawar has flunked too. Let's have a look at the girls' result now. Gadre, Deshpande, Sundri, Sarawate...all of them pass. What's up? The grades are really low for you. Ambekar pass.. Sorry she fails. Shirodkar? Ma'am, she isn't here. They got transferred to the city. Her father will collect her report card later. Shirodkar has passed. Mande has passed. Mansi has flunked. 'What are these boxes for?' 'We keep moving because of her father.' We need those to pack our stuff. 'We should not meet here. Looks bad.' 'Can I leave now?' Down with emergency! Hail democracy! Down with emergency! Hail democracy! Down with emergency! Hail democracy! Down with emergency! Hail democracy! Down with emergency! Surya has flunked. He is going to stay in the same class. Phavdya has flunked too. He is not going to attend school anymore. Chitre is moving to the city now. We are never going to meet again at the building. School has ended. Now I have to face the horror of 10th grade!
