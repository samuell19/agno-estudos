You know,my editor thinks that I should write them all down and publish them in a book. That's a good idea. You always have the most interesting stories. Perk of being a travel writer. That and global entry getting me past the airport lines. You know, you should look into getting that. Yeah... William... The, uh... the almond, and your expression. We've only been dating six months. Listen, my parents called yesterday, and they want me in Boston for Christmas, and I want to be with them. It's Christmas, em, and being with my family is an important tradition for me, and I would love to have you there. You know I'm more transient than traditional. Yeah, I know. I mean, people probably always tell you that one day you’ll settle down, but... I don't know that you will... At least, not with a regular guy like me. [Em]: So... We broke up... Which doesn't seem to surprise you. You can't fake chemistry, especially when one half of the couple is rarely in town. That's because someone whom I'm pointing at right now keeps sending me out on assignments. Would you like me to stop? No. You know I love it. I do know that, though I don't know how you do it. Experience. I grew up living out of my suitcase. I guess I'm used to it. And as your editor, I love that about you. As your friend... Say it. I want you to get that almond. That would require me to stay in one place for an extended period of time. One day, you're going to find someone who'll make you want to do exactly that. I did. Speaking of, you're welcome to join Keith and me for Christmas. The kids'd be over the moon to have auntie Emory there. Aw, I love them, but I was thinking about renting a cabin up to the mountains and relaxing before someone sends me my next assignment. You're going to be alone? On Christmas? It's not the first time. I'll be okay. [School bell ringing] You can't get that tie off fast enough. Reminds me, I spent all day in court. Oh, please. You spend 90% of your time in jeans. One of the perks of leaving the corporate counsel world behind. Oh, maybe I should give it a try. So you stay at a hotel for Christmas? Uh-huh. My Nana comes over, we open up presents, and then we go to a hotel for brunch. What do you and your mom do? We go to pine grove. It's my favorite place for Christmas, like, ever. -Have you ever gone?-No. You've got to. There's sledding, ice skating, and we get to chop down our own tree. Really? Yeah, it's so much fun! Katy! Dad! Hi, sweetheart. Do you have to go back to work? Nope, I'm done for the holidays, and I figured we could do some Christmas shopping today. What are you guys doing for Christmas? We'll probably just go to brunch with my mom. That sounds fun. Yeah, it's fun. Right? Some year, you guys should try and get out to the mountains. It really brings out that Christmas spirit. Yeah, maybe someday. All right, put your hood on. Let's make a run for it. You ready? Set... go! Come on! [Editor]: So... About your trip to the cabin in the mountains. How much relaxation do you actually need? Are you about to give me an assignment right before my vacation? Here's the deal. Phil Laskert was supposed to give me an article to publish online for Christmas day, but he apparently is stuck on an ice floe in the Antarctic. Again? [Chuckling] So I'm in bit of a pickle. Hey, did I ever tell you about the German tradition of the Christmas pickle? And that's why you're going to write me a 2,000-word article on an old-fashioned American Christmas. An old-fashioned American Christmas? That's both broad and vague. Think of it as an opportunity to sit back and reflect on all the Christmas traditions you missed growing up, and I'm going to need it on the 23rd. As an incentive, and because I’m also awesome, I booked you a cabin in Pine Grove. My treat. This is bribery. Yes. Yes, it is. I know that look. What's up? I was just thinking that maybe we could do something different this Christmas. Like, different how? Like... Not a hotel for brunch. Hey, hey, hey. What's going on? We had an assignment in class today. We could write about anything. I started thinking about Christmas. Oh, yeah? No, I mean, like... The ones we used to have with mom. We'd go up into the mountains and have snow, and everything smelled like Christmas trees. You remember that? It's fuzzy, but yeah. "Make cookies. Build a snowman." "Gingerbread house." That was your mom's favorite. I suppose you have some place in mind? [Woman]: Pine Grove? Apparently, her best friend from school has been talking about it non-stop. She even made this "Bucket List" of things to do to make it the best Christmas, and most of them involve snow. [Mother]: Oh, Scott, this is so adorable. I don't think we actually spent a Christmas in a cabin in the woods. Or we just stay here, you know? I mean, the important thing is that we're together. Yeah, but that's not what Katy asked for, and she asks for so little. Tell you what. Why don't I get this as a Christmas present for you and Katy? Mom... No, I insist. I'm going to find the most charming cabin in Pine Grove for both of you to stay in. What about you? Well, I've got Bree Tenner's birthday in a few days, and I promised I'd attend. Okay, fine, so you attend, and then you join us. I mean, you never go anywhere. Oh, that is not true. I went to your aunt Ruthie's July 4th. That was three years ago, and that was in Oakland. I mean, I basically can see Oakland from here. You barely leave the Bay Area. That's because I'm a homebody, and you know it. I'm not letting you be alone for Christmas. If you don't go, we don't go. Scott... Mom... Please, Nana? Now, how am I supposed to resist that? You're not. Oh... Of course I’ll go. [Phone ringing] Hi, dad! [Dad, on phone]: Hey there, Pumpkin! How's Hong Kong? [Dad]: Well, we just got here a little while ago. Not too late for you to join us. You'll be in meetings the entire time, and mom'll be on the phone dealing with her charities. Boy, it's as if you've met us before. Once or twice. Mom says hi. Hi, mom! No, I'll wait 'til we can take a real vacation together, maybe in the spring. All right, done. We'll look forward to that. So, what are you doing for Christmas, huh? Are you going to be jetting off to some far corner of the globe? Actually, I've rented a cabin up in Pine Grove. Pine Grove? Haven't been there since you were little. I've been to Pine Grove? You have. We went there together for Christmas one year. You were maybe four or five, I think? I don't know. It was before I started the company. I don't remember that. I do. Might've been the last old-fashioned Christmas we had together. We had an old-fashioned Christmas? We did. Once upon a time. It's like I stepped into another world made entirely of Christmas. Did I mention the guy that I rented the cabin from also runs the candy store? Uh, you didn't, but somehow, it makes perfect sense. Maybe it'll be good for your writing. Have you figured out your angle on the article yet? Uh... nope. Well, don't over-think it. Just experience it. It'll come. Well, that's just it. I haven't experienced it... I mean, not the way that people think of here. Italy, Brazil, Tibet? Sure... But snowmen and Santa? I got nothing. I know, but at least it sounds like you're in the right spot to give it a try, and who knows? You may even be inspired to finish that book idea we discussed. Maybe. That would require me to stay in one place for an extended period of time. It's been known to happen. To others. Okay, I've got to go find this cabin-rental-slash-candy-man. Ciao! [♪♪] Excuse me, do you know where I can find Hal Hindry? That would be me. Oh, great, um... So I'm Emory Blake, and I'm... [Man]: Hey, Hal? What do you want me to do with the posters for the gingerbread house contest? Oh, good! Hang one in the front window. Sorry about that. What was your name again? Emory... Excuse me. Skip! Can you help Mrs. Chase? It's a crazy time of the year. I'm just here to pick up some keys for a cabin rented under Emory Blake? Ah, my other job. This way. Ah... Looks like you’re in Cedar Bluff. That's a wonderful cabin. Is the other half of your party with you? Uh, no. It's just me. Is it? What should I do with the rest of these? Hang one in every store window out by the Rec Center, then. -Okay, you got it. -Sorry. It's our gingerbread house contest, Pine Grove's version of the Super Bowl. This has everything you’ll need, and a map to the cabin. Now, there’s a big snow storm headed our way soon, so I hope you have snow tires. It's going to be a doozy. Right... There you go.

[Screaming] My knee! What the...? You have ten seconds to get out of here. What just happened? Seriously, I know Krav Maga, and I am not afraid to use it! There's a sledding hill out there! Whoa... It's okay, honey. It's... it's okay. You broke in with a kid? We didn't break in. We used a key. We're renting this place. This is my place! I swear, the only thing I’m reaching for in my coat is my phone, okay? I'm going to show you our booking reservation. Slowly. Just a phone. Booking confirmation. Hal... Hindry. Cabin rentals and candy man. Yeah. Pretty sure there's only one. My confirmation is right there. [Scott]: Great... So... So... So we're all going to stay here? No. Oh, dear. I am truly, truly sorry. I don't know how... Skip, put the licorice on the top shelf... This happened. It's a mystery. The important thing here is that we have a place for Ms. Blake to stay. Oh, um, you're just going to assume that I'm the one that's going to give up the cabin? I have a kid. Seriously? You don't even hesitate to play the kid card? My mom comes in tomorrow. Yeah, well... Your confirmation says that you booked just two days ago, which means I booked first. There are three bedrooms in this house, which is too big for one person. I rest my case. Are you an attorney? I am. That makes me want to stay put even more. [Scott]: What do you do? Travel writer. Perfect. I'm sure you're accustomed to accommodation inconveniences. Yep, so I can tell you from experience, that you're going to have no trouble finding someplace else. I'm terribly sorry, but there are no other cabins. [Together]: None? Pine Grove is booked solid at Christmas months in advance. The only reason Cedar Bluff was available was because of a last-minute cancellation. Okay. What about someplace else? I called around as soon as you told me what happened. There's nothing. I'm so terribly sorry. Where do I put the white chocolate pretzels? Up front. Right over here, Skip. Oh... So there are no rooms at any inn. Strangely appropriate. Mm. This would be perfect for sledding. C'mon... Ugh, fine. Kid card wins. I'll head back to San Francisco with my Christmas cabin experiment officially over. But it's snowing really hard. You didn't want to drive when it was snowing bad, remember? [Emory]: Katy, don't worry. I've motorcycled through the Andes. I can handle this. Yeah, see? She'll be fine. Thanks for this. All right, Hays family, Merry Christmas, and, uh... Enjoy my cabin. Our cabin. Ha... Hey, thanks again. We appreciate it. Whew! [Engine sputtering] Oh, no... Please don't be like this. [Engine sputtering] Dad? Start, start, start... Ugh... [Engine starting and humming] [Exhaling] [Engine sputtering and dying] Oh... [Horn honking] [Knocking] How's it going? Oh, she just gets a little, uh, sensitive when it's cold. Well, it's only going to get colder. Fair point. You know, you can always just come back and stay at the cabin until the storm passes. Just for tonight. Just for tonight. [Wind blowing] I will be out of here just as soon as the shop gives me the okay. It's the alternator. How can you tell? You can hear it. You're both a lawyer and a mechanic? No, my dad and I used to tinker around with cars when I was younger. Huh. Expand on the "huh." You don't seem like a car guy. How can you tell? We just met. What, you don't get first impressions of people? No, not that specific. Hey, are you sure you don't want to sleep upstairs in the extra bedroom? Oh, no. Your mom's coming tomorrow. This way, the room'll be nice and fresh for her. Okay. Besides, I like sleeping next to a fire. Next to the net of a catamaran in the Caribbean, I'd say it's my favorite place to sleep. The net of a catamaran? [Laughing] Don't knock it. Once you fall asleep with Orion coming over the ocean horizon, you realize you just fulfilled a dream you never knew you had. All right, I'm starting to get a small sense of who you are. You're adventurous. I am. Rarely in one place for too long. All my life. Army brat? Sort of... Minus the army. My parents worked in international finance. I grew up traveling my whole life. Mm. And tomorrow, I'm hitting the road again. Thanks again for letting us stay. No, thank you. Sleep well. Good night. [♪♪] [Floorboard squeaking] Sorry. Don't be. I was just about awake anyway. Are those from all the places you've been? Uh... Some of the places I’ve been, yeah. I want to travel one day, see everything. Oh, yeah? There's a lot to see. Would you want to look through some of my travel photos while I go get cleaned up? Really? Yeah, sure. Here. There you go. Have at it. [Scott's mother]: I think you made the right call. I'm monitoring the weather conditions, and it looks like all the roads going into the mountains are closed right now. Well, how long is that going to last? Mm, at least a day to clear them? That's what I read. So your guest is stuck,even if her car is ready today. [Sighing] What's with that expression? Nothing. Don't "nothing" me. I raised you. Is there something wrong with this woman? No.she's, uh... Pleasant. Pleasant? Hmm. What's her name again? Emory Blake. She's a travel writer... And no, it's fine. It's just unexpected. [Phone chiming] [Chuckling] Your granddaughter just texted me, demanding breakfast in bed. Oh.well then, you'd better go. I'll let you know as soon as I’m on the way to you, okay? Love you. [Chiming] Emory... Blake... Pleasant. Hmm. -Oh! -whoo! I'm sorry. It's okay. At least you didn't hit me with Krav Maga this time. The day is young. Well, good. Then I have something to look forward to. Well, I plan on spending the day writing. I've got my eye on this little office attic space up there, and I claim dibs, so please don't get any ideas. It is all yours. Katy and I will be working on her bucket list. Her what? It's her list of all the awesome things she wants to do for Christmas. Oh, well... You'd better get cracking. All right. We'll stay out of your way. Yeah, good luck. ♪ I don't want much for Christmas ♪ ♪ I love Louis and I love Dior ♪ ♪ but I've got my heart set on something different ♪ ♪ one special thing I’ve been wishing for ♪ ♪ I've been waiting all year long ♪ ♪ underneath the mistletoe the time has come ♪ [Door slamming] ♪ Santa gave me just one wish ♪ [Katy and Scott talking] ♪ Baby, I want your Christmas kiss ♪ [Katy and Scott talking] ♪ I think I found my perfect present ♪ ♪ wrap you up and put you under my tree... ♪ Whatcha looking at, buddy? Emory let me look at it. It's all her travel photos. Oh. These are from Christmas all around the world. Quite a few photos here. Yeah, I want to travel a lot. Really? But then I would spend all of my time going, "where's Katy?" What is she doing? Is she having fun? Is she safe?" [Mock-sobbing] It's okay. I'll come back every Christmas. I'm holding you to that. -Okay. -okay. Okay! [Katy]: I'm so excited. We're finally doing this. [Scott]: All right, so you're going to be doing it. I'm going to let you cut down this tree with your big old muscles. [Katy]: Yeah! [Scott laughs] Why do you have a saw? Well, cutting down a tree with my bare hands is ineffective. Ha ha... Don't quit your day job, counselor. We're getting our Christmas tree. [Scott]: There's a tree farm near town where you can cut down your own Christmas tree. And I've wanted to do this my whole life. Ha, that long, huh? Have you ever cut down a Christmas tree? I have to say, in my whole life, I have not. Is it fun? Well, we're about to find out. It's our new tradition. Isn't that an oxymoron? So we've never done it before, but the tradition is old. [Emory]: Right. Old-fashioned... Which I saw on your list in there. I took a little peek. It's very thorough. Very long as well, so...we're going to get going. Right, um,so, ha.... Here's the deal. I have to write an article about an old-fashioned American Christmas, and, uh... I haven't been in the states for Christmas in, well, forever. So... What are you trying to say? Could I... tag along? Just to observe. You want to observe our Christmas? Just to get some inspiration? I think your list is exactly what I need. Christmas is for sharing. See? Right there. That is what I am talking about. Yeah, fine. Observe. Great! Thank you. I'm just going to grab some gloves and a hat, and... one second. Please don't leave without me! These are nice. You guys like any of these? [Together]: That one. [Laughing] That one it is. Okay... Can Emory cut it down? I thought this was something you wanted to do your whole life. Well, yeah, but... You need help with your story, and besides, I have more time. [Snickering] Hey, you watch it, pal. We're about the same age. Are you sure? What? You think I can't? [Scott]: No, you seem like you could do anything you put your mind to. Mm, how would you know? We just met. Been around you long enough to form an opinion based on observation and empirical evidence. Oof, there's the attorney. By the way, the garage called when you were in the shower. It's the alternator. Hmm. Bet you're proud of yourself, aren't you? It feels pretty good. It'll be fixed by tomorrow, but until then... Thank you. Oh! Would you take my picture? Yeah. Oh, right, um... It's an actual camera. You just point and shoot. [Katy]: You just press the button? Okay. [Scott]: Little different than your phone, huh? [Katy]: Yeah. [Sawing] [Emory]: All right, guys. [Camera clicking] Here goes nothing. [Creaking] [Camera clicking] Ha ha...Oh! There we have it! Nice work. Thank you. [Scott]: You did it. All right. [Emory]: That is a beautiful tree. All right, one more picture? [Katy]: Stand next to the tree. Right. You too, dad. [Laughing] Okay. Say cheese! Cheese... Or Christmas tree! [Camera clicking] It's fun having a real one to play around with. Oh, yeah? You can keep it. [Scott]: Oh, no, hey, that's... No, come on. 'Tis the season, and all that. I took a lot of my travel photos with that camera. It's good luck. Thank you so much! All right, I think I'm going to need some help carrying this tree. I got this. I got it. Thank you! Follow me. You excited? Yeah. Let's take this home. Katy! Johnny! Well, well, look who we have here. Why didn’t you tell me you were coming to my neck of the woods? I'm sorry. I just got a little distracted. I see. Hi. I'm Alice. Alice Bennett. My son, Johnny, goes to school with Scott's daughter. Oh, great! Hi. I'm Emory Blake. So, are you guys here together? [Together]: No. No, we had a mix-up with our cabin rental. [Emory]: Double-booked, and then my car had troubles, and I got stuck by the snowstorm. Oh... That's unfortunate. But I'm heading back to San Francisco as soon as possible. Oh, what a shame you won't be here for Christmas. Pine Grove is just magical this time of year. I'm so glad that you and Katy -are finally getting to see it. -It was about time. I've been hearing you talk about it long enough. Yeah, I practically deserve a commission. I don't think Hal would like that. Oh, so you met Hal! Isn't his shop great? Johnny makes sure it's our first stop every time we come. I'm sure it’ll be Katy's, too. Although his record-keeping could use a little work. All right, well... We should get this thing home. Okay, well,now that we know you're here, I'll be in touch. There are so many fun events you shouldn't miss. It was really nice to meet you, Emory. You, too. [Scott]: Great. Hey, my man. All right, let's go, kiddo. [Katy]: I'll go get more Christmas lights. Perfect. That is a good-looking tree, if I do say so myself. And you did. And I did. You know, I think Alice thought it was good-looking, too... Amongst other things. I'm just saying, she's very pretty, and... very interested in you. She is a parent at Katy's school. See how much you guys have in common? It's not like that. Okay. The thing is, I haven't really dated in a long time. My wife passed away when Katy was six. Oh. I'm so sorry. I just assumed... But Katy told me that Christmas in the mountains was the one thing that she could remember about her mom. Now I see. And so she came up with this list... And that's why you're here. That's why we're here. Nana's going to love this tree. All right, what do we have on that list? Building a gingerbread house. Oh! I saw that there’s a gingerbread house contest in town. Dad, we have to do it. Oh, we have to? It's a requirement? Yes. It's number four. It's number four. Well, then you've got to. All right, what else do we have to look forward to? Baking cookies... Naturally. Hanging lights around the cabin. Happening. Also...ice skating. Oh, good. I saw a rink on the way in. Do you ice skate? Um... I've watched a lot of ice skating when I lived in Finland. It's not really the same thing. You think? Katy! Okay... All right, have fun. Be safe. You too. Okay. Here goes nothing. You okay? Uh... just a bruised ego. [Laughing] You're not supposed to laugh. You get points for determination. Yes, well, that is one of my skills... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Unlike ice skating. I will be doing a triple Axel in no time. Yes, because you have an amazing coach. Because I am a warrior when it comes to a challenge. [Alice]: Scott! Hey, Alice. Hey! Hi! We are seeing you everywhere. Hi, Emily! Uh, Emory. Oh! Sorry. Good news! One of the roads has opened up, so you should be able to head home as soon as your car's fixed. Oh, fantastic. Also fantastic... I scored two extra tickets to the local production of "The Nutcracker." I would've gotten a fifth, but I assumed that you would be going home by then. Oh, of course. So it's, um, tomorrow night. What do you say? You and me, Katy and Johnny? Sounds amazing. Great, then it's a date! See you then! "Date" is just a figure of speech. One often associated with going on a date. Yeah, but it's...I mean, it's not a date. Right. Little pro tip from a woman's POV.? She thinks it's a date. All right, triple Axel time. Whoa... Whoa! [Editor]: So, what are you doing now? Following them around and taking notes? No, I'm participating in parts of Katy's Christmas list. Oh, good. I told you, I cut down the tree. And I'm very proud. Is it helping? With the article? You know, it is, actually. I had a mostly productive morning. That's encouraging. You know... And it's been fun. Really? Yeah, I mean... Bruises from the ice skating aside. Naturally. Plus, it was very entertaining watching Scott try to pretend this whole Alice-Nutcracker thing isn't a date when it so obviously is. That doesn't bother you, does it? What? No. I mean... Sure, he's a nice guy, albeit pretty goofy at times, but, you know, he should date whoever he wants. And you're sure that's not you? I'm sure. Anyway, I'm leaving just as soon as his mother gets here. What's keeping you there now? Oh, well, I promised Katy that I'd help her decorate the tree once her grandma gets here... Which is the quintessential Christmas experience, right? Especially with a cute kid and her handsome single father. I never said he was handsome. Is he? Only in the most conventional sense of the word. Meaning obvious to those who have eyes. Correct. So, he's handsome. Correct. And you like him. I believe the word you're searching for is "correct". Veronica, if you could see this woman he doesn't realize he’s going on a date with... I mean, she's perfection. Nice dodge, and no one's perfect. Alice is close. She's pretty and nice and has her own cute kid... I mean, she's exactly what a guy like Scott would want. But do they have chemistry? Because, like I said, you can't fake chemistry. [Vehicle driving up] We made it... We made it. And it was worth it. -This place is beautiful. -Isn't it lovely? Oh, my goodness. I've got to go. Where is everybody? [Scott]: Hey! Oh, my goodness. I've missed you! You made it! Good. Glad to have you. Emory! Come meet my mom. Hi! Emory Blake? How nice to meet you. You too. I'm so happy that you finally could make it. So am I. It has been quite the adventure so far. I bet. I'm going to go help Hal with the luggage. Okay. Did you see the Christmas tree? Tree? [Gasping] It's beautiful. Aw... mwah! Emory cut it down. Did she now? [Katy]: She travels a lot. She's had Christmases all around the world, but she hasn't had a Christmas in America for a long time. Yeah, so long that I can't even remember the last time I celebrated here. Well, then I'm so glad our family could share it with you. I am going to talk Scott into making a roast for Christmas dinner. Ooh, that sounds amazing, but I'm out of here just as soon as my car is fixed. And when the bridge is repaired. The bridge? It is out. That's why I brought Marilyn up the back way, by ATV. Seriously? [Hal]: They should have it fixed first thing in the morning. [Sighing] That means you get to stay here longer! [Scott]: All right. Now, by show of hands, who wants to finish decorating the tree? [Grunting] [Laughing] How come they went out? Uh, one of them must be out. Well, which one? You have to figure out which one it is. Well, that's inefficient. Well, you wanted a genuine Christmas experience. When do we get to the cookies? Here's an extra. Find it. Oh, here we go. Ha ha! [Cheering] ♪ O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree ♪ ♪ your leaves are so unchanging ♪ ♪ O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree ♪ ♪ your leaves are so unchanging ♪ ♪ not only green when summer's here ♪ ♪ but also when it’s cold and clear ♪ ♪ O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree ♪ ♪ your leaves are so unchanging ♪ Looking good! [Katy]: Oh, what are those? [Marilyn]: I brought these from home. These are your Christmas ornaments. I've had them in storage in the attic. I think it's time we bring them out. Don't you? Now, this one... This one has your name on it. Your mom and I made that for your first Christmas. What do you guys think about putting some of these on the Christmas tree? Candy canes? One of my first Christmas memories was one of our neighbors in Berlin, their tree was just... covered in them. It was so festive. So you do have a Christmas tradition after all. I guess so. Hadn't thought of it like that. I love that idea. All right, we've got to make sure we get them all on the tree. All of them? Where's the fun in that? Here you go. [Katy]: So pretty! Yeah! What's up? How do you put pictures onto a computer? Oh, you've got to plug it in. There's a cord in the back of the case. Like a phone. Yeah, like a phone. Thanks. I have an idea for a project with photos. What about? I can't tell you. It's a surprise. [Phone chiming] Oh... What? What's wrong? Uh, nothing. It's from Alice. I lost track of time. Katy, we have to get ready for "The Nutcracker." What about the tree? We're going to have to finish it tomorrow. Alice and Johnny will be here in 15 minutes. We've got to get ready. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. We won't stay out too long. [Marilyn]: Don't worry about us. I have plenty of wrapping to do. Ooh, I'll help. [Marilyn]: Well, thank you. Have fun on your date. Not a date. [Sighing] I haven't wrapped this many presents since I spent a semester with the Marcoux family in Belgium... All eleven of them. Oh, my. [Laughing] And what about your parents. Do they celebrate? Yeah, they do... Just from, you know, wherever we are in the world, which isn't usually the states. When Scott was growing up, Christmas was our favorite time of year. I would cook for days. We would roast chestnuts, and I would make sure the house was thoroughly decorated, of course. We haven't done that in years... Not since... That must've been so hard. Yeah, it was. Scott just seems a little lost ever since. No, that's not the right word. It's more, um... Protective... Of Katy and himself. That's understandable. But it's not sustainable. He used to be so much more... free. I just want him to get back to that, be a bit more open. Well...maybe he'll meet someone. More tea? Sure. Thank you. [Car approaching] [Car doors closing] [Alice]: That was so much fun. Good night. Bye! Okay, have a good night! Hey! How was it? So much fun. Oh...aren't you tired? Not me. Oh...[laughing] Uh, hey, um... The garage called, and they're going to bring my car by here tomorrow afternoon. So you're leaving? No! Katy... But she's going to be alone. Wouldn't be my first time. [Marilyn]: Stay. I mean, you're clearly having fun. The company has made it wonderful. Then keep the company. [Laughing] Dad? It's up to Emory. As long as I get my article done, I don't suppose it could hurt. Yes! Yes! Great. How goes the article? Slowly, but at least it's going. What about you? You got some work waiting for you when you get home? Plenty when all is said and done. Uh, corporate law? Good guess... Thank you. But wrong. Uh, good guess once. Oh, so you once did corporate law. Once. I worked every single minute I could and far more than I should. What happened? Lisa. You know, she always begged me to work fewer hours, and I... never listened, and after she was gone, everything shifted. After you. All right, so... What can we do to make the most amazing gingerbread house ever? An ice rink in the back yard! Mm! Yes! I'll make blue frosting. Perfect...I think we need a fallen ice skater on the ice, too. Just for authenticity. That's mean. [Giggling] Okay, what else? We need pine trees. We can use pretzel sticks with dyed green Rice Krispies or popcorn for the leaves. If all else fails, we can just use an overturned sugar cone with green gum drops. How do you know all this? We lived next to a bakery when I lived in London. You'll find I'm a wealth of trivial information like that. As I'm learning. What about the roof? Oh, I know, why don't we use Graham Crackers? Or brown frosting, or we could even use some almonds, you know, as shingles. Not almonds. Why? It's a long story. Are you familiar with Swedish Christmas porridge? No. Let's just say I’m recently single because of it. Interesting. We could use white frosting and put snow all around it. What do you think? Perfect! I love it. Snow everywhere. Everywhere. Finishing touch. Mm-hmm. That's a good look for your snowman, but you need to go get yourself a new hat, 'cause your snowman is presently warmer than you are. No colds for Christmas. Picture time! Say.... snowflakes. Snowflakes! [Camera clicking] Can I take my camera to Johnny's party? Of course. I'll go get my hat. Party? Yeah, uh... Alice apparently throws a party for all the families that are in town. She made sure to invite you and my mom. That's nice of her. She's a nice person. I take it your date went well? I'm sorry. I'll stop. I'll stop. So, you're currently single. Is that why you came to spend time alone for Christmas? A bit. I guess I came out here just to, you know, gather my thoughts and why I... I don't know, haven't settled down... And then my editor took advantage of my quiet alone time. And then we barged in. Which has proven to be helpful. Glad to be of service. Yeah, it's been... Different... Actually doing all these things, you know? Decorating the tree... Building this girl here. [Laughing] I didn't realize how much I'd been missing. Now I just need to figure out the angle of this article. Yeah, so, back to this almond thing, how did that play into you being single? To be fair, it wasn't entirely the almond's fault. The break-up was inevitable. Why? Well, for starters, we weren't together enough. Because of your travels? Yeah, that was definitely an issue, but... Let's just say something was missing. Whoa! Uh-oh. Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, you're going to get it! -Aah! -[laughing] No! Aah! I missed! Aah! Oh no! Aah! [Laughing] Watch out! Aah! Aah! Gotcha! Aah! You're not hiding well, I tell you right there. Get him, get him, get him! Aah! [Laughing] Whoo! Okay, seriously, truce. Truce, truce. We're done. Ah-ha! Twice I got you! Hello. Hello! Oh, I'm so glad you all could make it. Great dress, Emory. Thank you. You too. Thanks. Katy, Johnny's upstairs, making Christmas ornaments with the other children, if you'd like to join. Can I, dad? Absolutely. Um, so, help yourselves to everything. I'm just going to steal Scott for a minute. I have some attorney friends that I would like for you to meet. Great. She is so lovely. And smooth. So smooth. Eggnog? So yes. [Hal]: Hey, Marilyn! Oh, look who's here. Look, I'll be back. Yeah. Come meet the travel group. Ah, fancy meeting Hal here. What a surprise! [Chuckling] It was a very interesting conversation. Hmm? They are all members of the Pine Grove Globetrotters, and they have invited me to join them on their upcoming trip down the Danube. That is awesome! I don't really travel... Well, not anymore. Why not? Well, when I was younger, I had to raise Scott, and then... I think I just got comfortable, you know, or maybe stuck. Gosh, I can't imagine not traveling. Really? Yeah. Well, aren't we a pair. [Clinking] Do you want one? Mm-hmm. You want to hear a crazy idea about what would make me very happy right now? What? Going home... Making tea... Working on our gingerbread house. Okay, so it's not just me, because I have been thinking about using a chocolate bar for a front door all night! Gingerbread nerd. I just think you’re jealous that you didn't think of it first. Guilty. All right, I'll get the girls. I'll get the coats. ♪ Christmas is near ♪ Christmas is just round the corner ♪ [♪♪] ♪ He's almost here ♪ Santa, he won't be much longer ♪ [♪♪] ♪ So bring on the cheer ♪ 'cause Christmas is just round the corner ♪ [♪♪] ♪ Counting his days ♪ Santa, he just takes forever [♪♪] ♪ Watch for his sleigh ♪ his reindeers will all be together ♪ [♪♪] ♪ 'Cause Christmas is near ♪ Saint Nick is just round the corner ♪ [♪♪] ♪ Get out the tree ♪ put up the lights...

There were some wonderful entries, and like last year, this year's decision is unanimous. Okay, let's cross our fingers. Fingers. For evoking the feeling of being at home during Christmas, the winner is... Number 12! [Clapping] [Laughing] Oh, my gosh! Thank you. Thank you. Let's get a shot of the winning family. Hey. No, no. Do a family-- [Typing] [♪♪] I'm so proud of you, sweetheart. We did it together. Yeah, but without your suggestion, we'd still be in San Francisco instead of snuggling trophies. Can we come here next year? You bet. Can we invite Emory? Ah... Yeah, I doubt that's going to happen, sweetheart. Why? She's been a part of everything, and a big part of why this is so much fun. It's true. She is an unexpected plus, but you know, she has her own life, a very full life, which I'm sure will take her someplace else next year. We can still ask her. Get some rest. Katy sleeping? Yeah, the sleep of the victorious. [Chuckling] She asked if we could come back here again next year. Oh, well, I think I'd like that, too. Yeah? Yeah. It's been nice. Are you enjoying being out of your comfort zone? Yes, I am, smarty. Hal, um... Asked me to join the local travel group. They're doing a riverboat tour down the Danube. Wow. And? I just don't think it’s me. Oh, but it could be, though. I suppose it could. Go! Travel the world. Branch out. Well, at the very least, I'm going to have Hal reserve this cabin for us next year, exclusively, this time. Katy did ask if we could invite Emory. Well, I don't suppose it would hurt to ask. That's exactly what she said. Exactly... Except it kind of does. Why? Mom, she's not going to say yes. How do you know that? Mom, Emory is a bright and independent woman who's traveled the world. She's not looking to settle down, and she's not looking to spend next Christmas here again at Pine Grove. She's spending this Christmas with us in Pine Grove. Look, the roads are clear. The bridge is open. She decided to stay. Yeah, but that's this Christmas. You know, it's sort of fun and spontaneous, and another one of her stories that she'll be able to share sometime... In the future, to someone else she meets along the way. Mm. I think the one creating the stories, my darling son... Is you. Where's Orion? Um, right... there. [Scott]: As pretty as that is, this isn't a catamaran in the Caribbean. I would advise sleeping indoors tonight. It is cold. Yeah, I noticed. Fortunately, I have a fireplace I get to snuggle up next to, get some more writing done. Oh, you finally figured it out? Yes. The hard part now is keeping it under 2,000 words. That's good news, isn't it? Yeah, it is... For the article, and for this book idea that I've been flirting with for the last couple years. Oh, well, now I’m intrigued. Mm... You can read it when it's done. How's it feel? To get it going again? Good... You know, which isn’t always the case with writing. Well, it hasn't been for me lately. Really? I thought... I thought you loved it. I do... But lately, I've been thinking about, you know, taking a break from so much traveling and just... focusing on the book. That's funny. What? Recently, I've been thinking the exact opposite... How now, Katy's getting older and how she can appreciate going out and seeing the world. She's so curious. That's important, you know. It's how we grow. Yeah. I feel like I forgot how to be curious, you know. I forgot how to be open. I feel like I've been locked up... A lot. When Katy suggested we come here, my first instinct was to say no, and that never used to be me. Well, I'm glad you said yes. Yeah? Yeah. I wouldn't have met you otherwise. [Katy]: Dad, can I have some water, please? I should probably... Yeah, I'm right behind you. Don't forget to come in from the cold. Coming, sweetheart. [Mail whooshing] [Computer chiming] [Phone ringing] Emory? Is everything okay? Everything's fine. I just finished my article, and I just wanted to say hello. Well, in that case, congratulations and hello. How's Pine Grove? Oh, it's just beautiful. Oh, and remember how I emailed you about the whole cabin mix-up? Yeah? Well, I actually ended up staying with the family, and we've been going around, doing as many old-fashioned Christmas traditions and things we can think of, and it's just been... magic. Christmas magic? Yeah... Christmas magic... And it, um... It got me thinking. Yeah, what about? Traditions. Why don't we have any Christmas traditions? But we do. We do? Sure. For both your mom and me, the most important tradition was that we're always together for Christmas. No matter where in the world we were, it was always the three of us, side-by-side. Yeah. The three musketeers. Exactly. But we aren't anymore. Well, we always invite you to join us, but, uh... You've got your own life to lead now, Emory, and I'm proud of you for that. Dad? Yeah? What is it, sweetie? Can we make sure the three of us are together next Christmas? Maybe come up here to Pine Grove? I'd like that. I think that's a great idea. [Whistling we wish you a Merry Christmas] Whatcha doing there? Making a stocking for Emory. It's not as pretty as ours, but... She'll love it. Do you think we'll see her after Christmas? Morning. Morning. [Marilyn]: According to Hal, there is a Christmas hay ride tonight. They're getting it in before the big snow storm tomorrow. I want to go on a hay ride. Is it on the list? It is now. Number eight. [Laughing] You, uh, want to join us? Sure, I'm game. [People]:♪ fa la la la la la la la la ♪ Don we now our gay apparel ♪ fa la la la la la la la la very important S'mores question... Mm? The marshmallow. Do you scorch, slow roast, or, please say no... leave it uncooked? Okay, don't think I’m weird, but I've never actually had a S'more. Say what? [Laughing] Wow. All right, well, that is soon to be rectified. Good. And by the way, the answer is slow roast. Ah, slow roast. Filed away. I'll be back with the ingredients. Okay. Say cheese! Cheese. [Camera clicking] Is this for your photo project? Yep. Mm. When do I get to see it? When it's ready. Are you having fun? I am. You know, I haven't been to a Christmas bonfire in... I don't even know. It doesn't matter. I'm at this bonfire, and I am having fun. [Johnny]: Katy! See you! So, was I right, or was I right? Oh, man, you were definitely right. This place has made Christmas special again. And, um...Emory, is she having fun? I think so. I'm glad. Come on, you'd have to be blind not to see the chemistry between the two of you, and I'm not interested in chasing after someone who's falling for someone else. Yeah, it just... It just happened out of the blue. I mean, it's crazy. Enjoy it. You know, not everyone gets that kind of magic. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [Phone ringing] Hey. Help. I'm spinning. Scott? But you almost kissed. Yeah, but we didn't. Now he's talking to perfect Alice, and they look happy and... perfect, with their laughing and their touching arms and their perfectly-suited lives. Oh, I do not miss this part. I just keep thinking about what William said, how no regular guy would want to date me because I travel too much. That's not how I remember you telling it. Especially a regular guy with a kid. Okay, look. Focus. Communication is key. Go to Scott and tell him exactly how you're feeling, and see if he feels the same way. What? Are you crazy? No one does that! Fine. Then kiss him. You'll find out one way or the other. Okay, so, uh, rapture or mortification... These are my options? Welcome to love. Now, I've got to go feed my kids and communicate to my husband that there's a limit to how many college bowl games one person can watch in a day. Good luck. [Sighing] Okay. [Scott]: We're gonna be okay. [Marilyn]: Yeah, well, you did spend a lot of time with her this week. I think we’ve always known where we stand, though. [Marilyn]: Mm. She is lovely, though. [Scott]: She is. No, she's great. She's really great, you know. We've had some fun moments, but I just don’t think she's it. [Marilyn]: Well, I'm glad you figured that out before anything happened. Yeah, that would’ve been awkward. Mm-hmm. You and Emory, however... You okay, Emory? Actually, I'm not feeling too well. Um... Do you know if there's a cab around? I don't want to bug Scott or Marilyn. I can take you home. Thank you, Hal. Come on. I thought I would never feel this again. You do? Yeah? You do? You do. Yes! Mom, you don't... You don't think being drawn to someone else is a betrayal? No. No, I don't. I think it's the most natural thing in the world, if it's the right person. Is she? Oh... She might be. Then don't wait, Scott. Never, ever postpone the chance for joy if you get it, all right? Promise me. I promise... But that goes for you, too, okay? You've spent a lot of your time taking care of me and Katy. Yes, because I’ve been worried about you. Well, you don't have to worry anymore. No. No, I don't, do I? I don't. I love you. I love you, too. Yeah. -[Scott]: After you. -[Marilyn]: Thank you. [Katy]: After you. [Marilyn]: Go on, honey. Let's go. [Scott]: All right, ladies. [Marilyn]: Good night, sweetheart. Love you. [Scott]: Good night, good night, good night, good night. -[Marilyn]: Say good night. -[Scott]: Good night. Goodbye. -[Marilyn]: Let's go, let's go. [♪♪] [Scott]: Well done. Thank you. There you are. Hal said that you weren’t feeling well last night, and you had to leave a bit early. Ah, sleep helped. I'm fine. Good. Well, my famous pancakes are almost ready. Where are you going? Home. Wait... what? Yeah, my editor called, and I got a new assignment. I've got to go to Katmandu tomorrow. But, I mean...tomorrow's Christmas day. I know, that's... That's the way it goes sometimes. But we still haven’t gone sledding, or watched Christmas movies. I know, sweetie, I'm sorry. I really... I wish we could have done those things, too. Emory's leaving! What? It's Christmas Eve. [Scott]: So you can't leave a little bit later? Like, after Christmas? I'm afraid not. I... Plus, there's this storm coming in, so I should probably head out before I get... stuck again. It was so nice to meet you! Oh, you too, Emory. And you, little one... You have been one of the best parts of this whole Christmas getaway adventure. [Katy]: I wish you could stay longer. All right, I'd better go. Emory, wait. Hey. Why do I feel like there’s something more going on here? I'm really sorry to disappoint Katy. Then don't. Stay. Merry Christmas, Scott. What happened? I have no idea. Hey, uh, your rear tire’s a little flat. Really? [Veronica, on phone]: Okay, calm down. I am calm. Crushed, embarrassed, and heartsick, but calm. Why are you embarrassed? Because it’s always embarrassing when you put yourself out therefor another person. But you didn't. Not really. That's not true. No, you did the whole sub-textual "I-like-you-do-you-like-me?" thing with your eyes, but you never actually put yourself out there by telling him how you feel, or kissing him. And it turns out, that's a good thing because I now have a tiny sliver of dignity onto which I'm now clinging, thank you. Well, if there's one positive thing that's come out of this, it's been your writing. Yeah. You know, I think I’m going to take some time, try and work on the book. That's good news, especially after this last article. You liked it? I loved it. You put more of yourself into this one, by far. What do you mean? Well, lately, you've been traveling so much, it's like you've developed this detachment. Detachment? Yeah, more and more, especially in your holiday articles where you write about traditions... Almost like an anthropologist. I had no idea. I know. That's why I kind of fibbed about the Phil Laskert situation. He didn't get stuck on an ice flow again? No, he did, but he could've still written the article. Then why did you ask me to do it? Because as your friend and your editor, I was hoping that if you had a reason to get involved in the kind of Christmas you never had growing up, maybe you'd understand what makes it so special, and you might develop a deeper connection to it. Well, that worked out better than you could've hoped. Can I show you something? Sure. Always. What do you got? It's my Christmas present to you and Emory. I emailed it to her, too. Just in time. All right. [♪♪] "Thank you for helping me make the best Christmas.

Honey, I think you're saying really important things, especially the part about me being right, but the reception is awful. Oh, no! [Tires squealing] [Engine dying] Veronica? Veronica, can you hear me? [Engine spluttering] [Engine dying] I'm on a road right outside of Pine Grove. Emory? Emory! Veronica? Okay, you, it's time for bed. Very busy day tomorrow. Okay. Okay. Love you. Mwah! Good night. Good night. Aw... [Cell phone ringing] Hey, Hal. What's up? Emory's car broke down. Her friend, Veronica, just called me. Did she say where Emory was? No, her phone cut out. Okay, I'll check the direction that I saw her drive out. Uh, stay in touch. What? Emory's car broke down. She's somewhere on the side of the road, so... Be careful! Whoo... Whoo! [Shivering] [Chuckling] Merry Christmas. [Engine humming] [Knocking] You've really got to think about getting a new car. -You think? -Come on. How did you know? Your friend called Hal, and Hal called me, and I came looking. Well, thank you. We're not in the clear yet. I mean... this visibility's dangerous. I almost turned back. Why didn't you? I care about you. You know, until we can see clearly again, we're going to have to wait this out here, so it looks like you're stuck with me a little longer. I'm sorry about all this. I know it isn't exactly part of your Christmas plans. I just... I just, I don't know why you left. I told you, my editor gave me a new assignment. C'mon, Emory. Something happened. Just be honest with me. Tell me, why did you leave? I was trying to make it easier for you. Easier? I heard you talking to Marilyn about me... How we're not suited for each other. So I decided to get out of dodge, so to speak. I said that about Alice... Whom, let the record show, I have zero romantic interest in. But she's perfect. Not for me. You know, I happened to notice that your car is facing north, instead of south. I was headed back to the cabin. I got the email from Katy, with the photos. I saw it, too. I tried to convince myself that what I was feeling wasn’t true. But then she captured it. Yeah. She did. Let me be perfectly clear with you. You captured all of my attention from the moment you threatened me with Krav Maga. That's what you get for crashing my vacation. You crashed mine. Scott, I've never felt this way about anyone before. It feels right. So we're in this together? All the way. [Car engine approaching] [Horn honking] Seriously? [Knocking] I'm no Rudolph, but I'll guide you back home. Thanks, Hal. [Laughing] What? I'm just happy! [Laughing] Hey, why aren’t you in bed? I'm waiting for Santa. Oh, thank goodness. Oh, honey. Emory! You came back! Well, rumor has it the best Christmas ever is happening here, so how could I miss that? You couldn't. Nope. Wouldn't miss it for the world. [Laughing] It's called Risyngrot. Is this the Swedish tradition with the almond? You know it? I travel a lot with my mother. In fact, you'll meet her. She’s coming on the April cruise! Oh! Wait, you're going? I am. [Laughing] Okay, now, what... What exactly is this tradition all about? Whoever finds the almond will be married within a year. You are exempt, little lady. [Laughing] I have all sorts of ideas for the travel group. You know, Costa Rica is the most bio-diverse place on the planet. That could be our next trip. As long as you bring lots of candy!
