Stop. Why not? We can't. It's not right. It feels right. You know, what's my favorite thing about this place is that we have our very private bathroom. Mom's bathroom felt more spacious. Ours feels more intimate. And it's praying time, not playing time. I don't know why the water suddenly got so cold. God knows. You missed the prayer. Are the floors here even clean enough to pray on? Yes, Mom, the tenant didn't have any dogs or kids. The apartment might be clean, but what about the neighborhood? At least back home, you knew who everybody was. Do you know I've yet to see another Muslim in this whole city? Mom, I'm sure there's a lot of Muslims here. It's a big city, Mama. - No, you get fuck out! - -You get the fuck outta here! - You get the fuck out. No, fuck you! - Get outta here! -Everything okay? -Yes. Can you close the blinds? -Where is Maryam? -She's asleep. We can't do this without her. She needs to pray with us. Mom, she doesn't know how to pray yet. Then it's my duty to teach her before I leave. But isn't Maryam too young to be praying? She's only seven years old. Do you know how old Susu was when he first started to pray? Look at him now. Maryam, wake up, love. Grandma wants to teach you something. I'm not feeling well. Wake up, dear. You'll feel better after, I promise. You can sleep all you want after grandma leaves. -Don't you want to learn how to pray? -I know how to pray. Really? You just have to cover yourself and talk to God, see? Nice try. Wake up, please. -Leave me alone. -Maryam. -Leave me alone. -Maryam, wake up. No. I learned this new game... where you get to look like a ballerina, dance like a ballerina. Good job, Mama. Okay, Maryam. That's enough practice, now come here. What? What is this? What? Why did you make yourself look beautiful? Mom said God is beautiful and loves beautiful girls. No! I told you what the Quran says. "God is beautiful and loves beauty." That's true. Now, I brought you a little surprise. Ah! And this will help you keep your beauty and save it only for God. Wow, thank you, Teta. This is how we pray to God. Get up, let's try it. Thank you, Mother, but for now, she's only playing to God. I'll give it to her when she's old enough to pray. Okay, so we're all gonna pray together and Teta here, she's gonna bless our new home. Oh, God, oh, God! Oh God! -Dad, are they praying too? -Okay, you've heard enough for today. Good job and I think you should go back to sleep now. Dad, let me go. What's with the rush, Mom? Your flight's for next week. -You can still look around the city. -I've seen enough already. Any more and I'm gonna lose my mind. Or worse, my faith. I guess we're going to the airport. -I can't, I have a student. -Already? How do you know anybody in the city? I posted an ad online. -Did you check if they have any-- -Of course. No single father, no teenage boys, no atheists and no dogs. Good, where is it? Just right after the first hill. That's really far away. How do you expect to get there? Public transit. Take a private cab, I'll pay for it. Save your money for a more private place. I am, Mom, very soon, all right? For your information, I have a... very, very promising job interview tomorrow. - Can I touch your hair? - I've already said no. Do you even have hair? So, you put X on this side, and everything else on this side. Why don't you try again? So, are you learning anything? Yeah, Dad, she's awesome. Hi, I'm Donald. Can you please put on some clothes? You know I don't like to wear clothes around my house. Sorry, sometimes I feel like I have two kids. So, how's our Allen doing? Is he gonna pass his exam? I can't promise anything, it was just the first session. Could you stay a bit longer then? Sorry, I can't, I need to get home. Just a little bit longer? I could pay you extra for your trouble. - It's not that, it's just... - Breaking news. I can't miss my prayers. - The result of a naked woman... -Could you pray here? If you're in a rush, you might want to avoid the highway. Censorship is a holy job. We cut sins out of scenes. If one sin escapes our attention, thousands may get infected and their sins becomes our sins. -Do you understand? -Yes, sir. - Welcome aboard. - Thank you, sir. So, which one of those is my office? Office? You work from home for now. Home? Once you gain some experience, you may get your own office. Wait. I... I can't... I don't know if I can edit in front of my wife and my kid. -You do understand? -I understand. Maybe this is not the most suitable work for you. No, no, no, no, not at all. Um... They'll have to understand once I explain the holiness of it and all. Good. And one, two, three, five, six, seven. One, two, three and turn, five, six, seven. One, two, three, now turn and dip. All right, very good. Now you guys, I want you to do the exact same thing, just a little bit closer. I want you guys to stay connected. And here we go. Two, three, five six, seven and one, two, three and turn, five, six, seven. One, two, three, turn and dip. You're late. I've been praying -for your safe arrival. -Anyone else home? Just Maryam, she's asleep. Where'd you get this? Spin me. What? I said, spin me. Did you come? Saeed? Windows back home were thicker than these walls. Can you give me some space? I'm falling off. What happened to our view? Do you mean all the buildings and people watching us? Who's watching? I like looking out. You can still look out. But nobody can look in. Brilliant, right? What about the plants? There you go. It feels just like Mom's basement. No, no, it doesn't. -I can't teach her like this. -Then go to their homes. Really? How about you put on a hijab and see how many people welcome you to teach at their homes? I bet I look better than you in a hijab. Hello? Who is this? -Who is it, Mama? -Allen. -He wants to talk to mom. -Who is Allen? My nine-year-old boyfriend, relax. -It's the kid I had class with yesterday. -Very funny, why is he calling? Hi, Allen. How are you? Hello, Elise. Today, at your work? Is there a private space? I guess it's fine. Can I come too, Mama? I want to play with Allen. Is it okay if my daughter comes too? She gets really bored at home. Just get Dad's permission. Dad, can I go please? -No. -Please, Dad, I want a friend. -No, stop. -Dad. Okay, stop. But what were the rules about playing with boys? -Don't let them get too close to me. -Yes. Why? Do you remember what happened to the princess who kissed the wrong prince who was not her husband? Yes, she turned into an ugly frog. The frog story again? I'm teaching her how to be a good Muslim. Good Muslims don't teach with fear. She's going to public school next year. You think they're gonna teach her about her duties? -About the responsibilities of puberty? -Mom, what's "puperdy"? Puberty. Nothing you have to worry about yet, honey. Puperdy, puperdy, puperdy. I'm leaving. Do you want her to stay here instead? With all this? No, just keep an eye on her playing and text me the address. Puperdy, puperdy, puperdy, puperdy, puperdy, puperdy. -Oh, Farash, hi. -Hey. -You're early. -Sorry. That's okay, come on in. -Hi, is this your daughter? -Yes. Maryam. Hi Maryam! Welcome to my studio. Thank you. We're just taking a break. Let me introduce you to the class. - Just a second. - Um... Come in. Class, this is Farash. Hey, Farash, I'm Edward. Sorry, it's nothing personal I just... -can't, 'cause I... -Because she has puperdy. Maryam! Okay, thanks, everybody. Give us five. Sorry, she never thinks of what she says. That's good. Think less and feel more. Took me years to teach that to my students. -Please have a seat. -Thank you. What do you teach here? Introduction to acting. Well, please make yourself at home. I'll be back shortly. Breathe into any areas of tension in your body. Notice any stored emotions, or feelings that are coming up in your body. Just become aware of them, no judgment. Good warm up, everybody. -What's this? -I was not sure. There's only one right answer. If you're here to always get it right, then you're in the wrong class. Acting is about being open. Open to infinite choices. -So? -Ah, I don't know. Follow the same rule and the answer is always the same. Allen, six times four... is 24. Our true feelings are often the opposite of what we express. I want you to try the line, "I think I'm in love again," using different emotions. Xantia, seduction. I think I'm in love again. Martin, fear. I think I'm in love again. Julie, sadness. - I think I'm in love again. We're afraid of making eye contact and letting people see us for who we truly are. So we build walls to protect ourselves from getting hurt. Here, we have no walls. Only open windows to get to know each other. I want you to keep eye contact with the person across from you until you feel connected. Until you see yourself in them. -I don't have a partner. -Then take turns. Somebody will eventually sign up. -Hey sweetie, how was class? -Good. Sorry, I hope my class wasn't too distracting. -We're getting ready for a play. -A play? -Yes. -Play? Can I play with Allen? Of course. Let's go, let's go. I was never allowed to be in a play, but I was a very playful child. Well, I guess we'll never stop playing. I'm sorry, I don't understand anything about acting. This is not how I imagined an acting class to be. To be a good actor, you first need to learn not to act. To be yourself, to know yourself. To know myself? But how? Some things are better expressed than explained. Why don't you give it a try? -Acting? -Mmm-hmm. Why not? Sorry, we must get home. Okay. Thank you. -Maryam, let's go. -Mom, I'm playing. -I said let's go. -Mom, let me play. Mom. - Mom, this is so much fun. -I know. Good job, Mom. Mom, get back up. -It's fire, you'll burn. -Oh. Sorry. Oh, my God, I wish Dad was here. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. - Yes! - -Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Didn't I tell you knock before walking in? I'm working. You never know what could be on screen. I'm sorry. Why... Why are you late again? I took Maryam to the park. She loved the city. -You missed Mahdi prayers. -I prayed in the park. In the park, in public? In front of people? God knows how many people stared at your ass every time you bent. Here. Start with the forgiveness prayers. We'll redo your prayer when I'm finished with work. What the hell are you doing? Could you please put something on? Maryam's home. Don't worry, she can't get out of bed, the door is locked. So when is that yoga class of yours? Tomorrow. Why? You want to make fun of me again? No, I'm just trying to make sure it's a safe environment for you to teach. Are you okay? -Yes. -Good, when can I see it? -You can't. -Why not? I told you, it's a private class, and don't worry, it's safe. So what else do you do there besides breathing? Nothing, just a bunch of women talking. About what? I don't know. How to get to know themselves... So you're telling me this is all women talking, trying to get to know themselves? Swear to God. Sorry. Now it makes sense. No one understands women, even women. Funny. So you think you know yourself just because you're a man? No, because I'm a Muslim man. It's my duty to know myself. Even our Prophet says, "To know God is to know yourself." But the actual hadith says, "To know yourself is to know God." Same thing. The point is, you have to know yourself, period. Do you? -I don't know. -You should know. -What if there's-- -There's no "what if" when it comes to an order. Even if it costs your family. Remember the story of Noah? He sacrificed his own child for God's command, to pass his test. It says so on page... On page... 45 and it was his duty to do it and he did it, and you keep questioning everything I tell you. Why can't you just do what I'm telling you to do? I know what's best for you. Hi, I don't think we have any more classes. No, we don't. I think I forgot something here. Imagination. Acting is imagining what or who we could become instead of who we actually are. Now, for the rest of this term, each of you will be assigned a role to play based on your performance. You want a script? -I'm not interested. -Just an extra copy. Today, we're working on a substitution technique. I'm gonna tell you an imaginary story and you're gonna substitute it with real life experience to make it feel real. Now close your eyes. Now imagine you're a little puppy. You go from door to door hopelessly looking for shelter. It's getting dark. But suddenly, you feel a tightness around your neck. It's a leash. You try to get out of it, but you can't. The harder you struggle, the tighter it gets. You're scared that if you run off, you'll be lost again and you'll never find a home. Farash? Farash, are you okay? Farash? Farash, wait. Farash! Farash, stop. Hey, are you crying? No, I just wanted to feel the rain. Is there something you want to share? -I shouldn't have stayed. -Was it something I said? - No. - Farash, are you okay? -I'm scared. -It's okay to be scared. If you face this, you'll overcome it, I promise. Don't use your acting tricks on me! I'm not, I'm just trying to know what's scaring you. You think you know everything, don't you? You don't know me, you have no idea who I really am. How can I know you if you're not even willing to know yourself? I know myself and I don't need you to tell me who I am. I'm a married Muslim woman with a kid and a husband and I'm the least likely person in this world to become an actor. This is who I am. Is that all you could be? Farash. Can you leave me alone at least with God? What's gotten into you? A Muslim never breaks her prayer, never. You can't break your prayer like this. Now start over and do it the right way. No, I'm not praying your way. My God's home is every way. Your God? Farash, your God? Open the door, Farash. Your God? I taught you about God, Farash, and now you're teaching me, huh? Open the door. If you don't respect me, at least respect God and finish your prayers. I chose my God and I choose how to pray. Stop saying "my God." You don't get to choose your God, Farash. He chooses you. Now open the door! - Leave me alone! - Leave you alone? Like your parents did? Stop. Maryam could hear you. Finish your prayers, or I swear-- Or what? Saeed, it's not back home here! Dad, what's happening? Nothing, sweetie. How did you get out of bed? -Is Mommy okay? -She's fine, yes. -Now go back to sleep. -Dad, -do you love Mom anymore? -Of course I do. Then why do you always fight? Because I love her too much. Mom, do you still love Daddy? Mom? Mom? - Mom. - Yes, darling. I think I'm in love again. I think I'm in love again. I heard you're looking for a new student. Embrace your inner animal. Follow your impulses. Imagine you're in the wild. That's it. Get in the circle. -You chose a bird. -Yes, it's a peacock. Peacocks can't fly. -But they're very colorful. -Fair enough. Okay. I want you to forget Farash, you're a peacock. I'm gonna play the drum, and you're gonna move around like a peacock, okay? -I'm not sure if I can. -Yes you can, follow me. Okay, you can do this. Right here in the center. Take a deep breath in, relax. Close your eyes. Nobody's gonna be watching, it's just you. Okay, beautiful peacock, show me your colors. -Dad, can you play? -I'm busy, ask your mom. Mom said she's busy praying. She's still praying? - Can you play with Maryam? She's-- Are you okay? I'll be out in a minute. I've never seen you so beautiful. You're glowing. It's true. They say when someone prays deep down from their heart, angels come down to kiss their tears. Oh. You look nice. Good job, Maryam. Wow, Mama's been teaching you. Maryam, I didn't know you could dance like that. Yeah, just do like your mom. -Come dance with us. -No, no, no, no. -Come on. -Please don't. -Come on. -No, please don't. Maryam, do you know what happens to people who eat before praying? Nothing happens. Would you like to do the prayer, Mama? Okay. God, thank you for making my dad cook and for making my mommy laugh, and for making me so beautiful. Is that it? You don't want to ask for anything? -So, how is class? -So much fun. Fun? Yeah, I mean Allen is a fun kid to teach. Oh, good. -How's the food? -Not bad for the first time. Don't get used to it. It might be the last time too. Maryam, what are you doing? God, please don't make my dad cook again. -Mama, please finish that. -It's a sin to waste food. It just needs a little more spice, right? Your dad sometimes forgets the importance of adding spice to things. Yes, but not too spicy. Maybe a little bit more spice. Dad, are you praying again? Each of these costumes represents a character you'll be playing. It's so easy for people to judge others just by the way they dress or look. But actors never judge a character they play. To play each character truthfully, you need to understand their essence. Today, we're gonna try something new. I want you to get a closer look at the person across from you and analyze them as if they're another character in a story. You still might not know much about them... but try to imagine what kind of life they have, how they spend their days, how they interact with others... even how they make love. I want you to literally put yourself in their shoes. I want you to exchange clothes with them. -Are you kidding me? -You serious? Are you serious about being an actor? Farash, you gave me your full commitment. I don't feel comfortable with this. Me neither. If you don't feel comfortable with feeling uncomfortable, you can't be an actor. Okay, if you put it this way. -Where are you going? -Change room. -You're safe in this class. -I know. Then what's blocking you? I can't show my hair. Then don't. -Wow. -No way. Slay. What the fuck? How do you feel? Um... Hot. - And you? - Very hot. Nice. You've just put yourselves into your character's shoes. Now it's time to walk in them. We're here. -Here? -Yeah. Are you serious? Well, Elise said, "Live the character and do what they do, go where they go," so this is how I live. -But you're pushing it too far. -I'm pushing it too far? I just went to the mosque for you. Do you like that? Okay, can we go now? That's good enough. Hey, we just got here. Come on! You can try one of these. Stop. -Stop. -Try it, try it. - Here. - Xantia, let's go. The owner keeps staring at us. So? I should be the one feeling uncomfortable wearing this, not you. Oh, God, okay, let's get you something lighter for starters. Hmm. Here. This should make you feel more comfortable. -Stop. -Hey, it's nice. So how's my sex life looking? What? I mean your sex life, -my character's sex life? -It's very private. I know, but how am I gonna spice up my relationship? I should know what my husband's like. What's he like? -Very controlling. -Controlling? Things are gonna get kinky, spill. -Please don't go there. -Come on. Fine, I know what to get for my controlling husband to loosen up. Good choice, sexy. Have you tried 'em before? -They're for me. -For you? Don't you guys have enough locks and chains at home? Excuse me? They're not for sale. -What do you mean? -That's okay, I don't want it. - He keeps staring at us. - We don't have Muslim toys here. Excuse me? I said I don't want it, Xantia, let's go. Wait, I want to know what's his fucking problem. What do you mean "Muslim toys"? What's your fucking problem? You are the fucking problem. Now get the fuck out of my store. We're sorry, I don't want it. Listen, Farash, it's not for you, it's for my character. She's gonna learn how to stand up for her rights, for her freedom. What the fuck are you weirdos talking about? I'm talking about these fucking handcuffs. Now you're gonna sell them to me or I'm gonna test all these fucking dildos up your ass one by one starting with the biggest one. Are you feeling okay? Relax and let me do all the work. No, no, take it off. Shh. I can't see what you're doing. You've seen enough, it's time to feel. What are you doing? Just trust me. -Farash, take it off. -Relax... and let it go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Farash, stop. Ooh, Farash, no. I told you not to do that. No, don't. Don't go there, Farash. All right, so it's "La ikraha fil deen." Try again. La... la ik... I can't. Can I finish my drawing? -Not until you learn properly. -It's a different language. I don't know what it even means. It's okay, honey. Your dad doesn't know what it means either. Go finish your drawing. Can you iron that dressy shirt? -We have guests tonight. -What guests? I invited my boss and his family over for dinner. Saeed, why couldn't you tell me earlier? -You know I have a class today. -Then cancel it. Do I have to take your permission every time I need to invite guests to my own home? It's my home too, I pay half the rent. If I don't make friends with them, I'll never get promoted. Speaking of rent, did you deposit your half? It's the first of the month. Yes. When did I have time to go to the bank? -I've been in class all week. -Good, don't forget. Any colored shirts? No, just wash this one. What for? -So she can wear it. -Can I wash it myself? -I know how to do laundry. -No, you don't. I do! I wash my own dolls' clothes. No, it's not her duty yet. It is our duty to protect her. The building is filled with strangers. So? We're not in a Muslim community anymore. The place is filled with wandering eyes. Then cover people's eyes, not our head. You don't know what's in people's heads. Or in yours, Saeed. We're talking about our daughter here, not some person on the screen to be censored. You know what? Let's get her to decide what's right for her. -You're kidding, right? -I can explain it to her. -She's a smart girl. -Yes, Mom, I'm very smart. It looks good on you. You like it? Can I have all different colors? -As many as you like. -When do I get my prize? If you ask me one more time, you're not gonna get it. I didn't know there's a prize involved in this. Does Mom get a prize for wearing her scarf too? Your mom already bought herself bags of prizes without dad's approval. Mom, where's your prize? Did you eat it already? You're my prize. You're my prize. Can you adjust her hijab? It's falling off. No one's watching. Mom, dad says God is always watching. -God doesn't-- -That's my girl. God doesn't have a bad eye, Maryam. I said, adjust her goddamn hijab, for God's sake. Mom, Mom, it's too tight, I can't breathe. Mom. - Come on, Karim. - Others have tried. -Ah. I gotcha. -Yay! Is Farash feeling well? I feel like we've hardly seen her tonight. She's been working so much that I decided to give her the day off and let her relax... And now she hates me for it. Can you believe it? Poor girl. She did seem exhausted. Yeah, the poor girl doesn't have time to even look good for her husband. Not a single drop of makeup on that tired face. Quiet. Maybe if you spent less time putting on makeup... you'd have more time to find your own husband too. Karim, they say women's power is in her beauty... and men's beauty in his power. And who says a woman can't have them both? There she is. Sit next to your husband, dear. Let him spoil you. It's okay, she prefers to sit on yoga mats these days. -Saeed. -Yoga mat? Yeah, the class she's teaching at is apparently a yoga class. So how did you end up teaching yoga? Oh, the woman is a yoga teacher with a little kid. She's barely home, so I have to go there-- Typical North American woman thinking she's a man. I was talking. Since I can't teach here and she's never home, I have to go there. At this point, I can't refuse work, especially when I have a moral and ethical obligation. Okay, okay, stop making me look like I'm the bad guy in front of my boss. Go teach the poor kid. Really? Why? Sorry. Wait, who's gonna do the dishes? Can I do it after? I'm running late. I can do it. -Thank you. -No problem. Sorry. You know, my brother never does favors for anyone... except his favorite little sister. There must be a place for us. Somewhere where every color of the keyboard plays the same song. Somewhere where being ourselves is not being wrong. You say "Fuck it, let's go." I know my line. Can we change it? No, the line won't change. You have to change. -I can't say it. -Yes, you can. F-U-C-K, "fuck." Sometimes you just have to say "Fuck it." Come on. "Fuck it," say it. "Fuck it." -I can't say it. -Yes, you fucking can. Please stop swearing. Just fucking say it, it's just a fucking word. -Oh, my God, fuck it. -Yeah, fuck it. Come on. Farash, let it out, let it out. -Fuck it. -Fuck it. -Fuck it. -Fuck it. -Fuck it. -Fuck it. -Fuck it. -Fuck it. Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it! When are you going to your class? Soon. When are you going to the mosque? -Soon. -What about dinner? -I'm not that hungry. -What about Maryam? I said what about Maryam? I'll drop her off at the praying lesson for kids. They usually feed them. -What? -You look handsome. You just noticed? You're going to the mosque like that? -Yeah, why not? -I thought you didn't like red. Of course I do, it's a great color. I love it. God is beautiful and loves beauty, right? Just keep exploring. - And as you're exiting from the curtain, keep connecting with your partner. I told you to never to call me at home. I told you he would listen to me. It's a done deal, honey. What? What's going on? You're looking at the new control supervisor. -You got promoted? -I just found out. -How did it happen so fast? -I told you, everything happens quicker in the city. Twice the pay for half the work. And the best part, I have three people working under me. Three. Congratulations! Just what you were dreaming of. This is why we moved to the city. I'm so proud of you. Now you can finally stay at home. What do you mean? You know you don't have to work anymore, I can provide. I never had to work, I always wanted to. If you want a full-time job, you can be a full-time mom. I can afford it and Maryam certainly needs you. I can't afford to be home all day, my job fulfills me. Don't worry. If everything goes right, you'll have a very fulfilling job for the next nine months. What do you mean? I want a son. -What? -I want a son. A brother for Maryam. A bigger family for us. Saeed, I don't think we're ready. We weren't ready for Maryam either but it all worked out. It was different then. Things have changed since we moved here. What's changed? Nothing. Except I have a better job to sustain a family now. Isn't this what you've always dreamed of? Now you're asking about my dreams? I thought you'd be happy. I mean, what else could you dream of, huh? Tell me, anything you want. I still want to teach. If you insist, I'll let you teach from home. Saeed, I'm not in the mood. Saeed, we really need to think this through. This is a very big decision. We made this decision a very long time ago. Tonight is a very whole night to conceive. I said no, Saeed. Pray with me, please. -I said no! Get the fuck off me! -What did you just say? I said get the fuck off. This one's from God for disrespecting your husband. The next one's from me and I won't be as nice. Saeed, get the fuck off me! No. I don't want to! Shut up! No! No! No! No! Get off me! No! Hey, not too far. I can already see them running around playing. Can you imagine? You'll thank me one day. This will bring us closer together. -Dad, get back up. -What? -You're burning in lava. What's the rush? I have class. Good, make sure you tell them it's your last class. I know it's overwhelming, but I want you to be the lead in the play. You've earned it. You've worked really hard, Farash. -I can't. -Of course you can. Hey, believe in yourself, you totally can do this. -Trust me. -Elise, I really can't. -My husband's gonna find out. -Your husband? Don't even worry about your husband. I've got it all figured out. With all these costumes and makeup, even your husband's not gonna recognize you. And you're gonna have a stage name. Any other excuse? Welcome everyone to the last class of the term. But for now, I want to celebrate this new chapter with a poem. "Life is like a short play. We're born on the stage. We act, direct and write it. Every day, a single page. Don't hide behind the curtains. Be good enough without a mask. You'll never know who you are... if you never dare to ask. Life's stage is full of rules. What is wrong and what is right. But the sun you seek is in you. Just follow your inner light." Now let's go back to our chairs and put your mask on. Get ready for the next exercise. This represents what the character is saying in the text. I'm happy. Underneath is what the character actually feels. I'm sad. The subtext. Today, we're going to unmask. I think you're a nice guy... but sometimes you can be an asshole. I feel like you're a scared little bird. Surprise me. Be brave. I feel like you want to connect with me. But every time I try, you get scared and shut me out. Farash, look him straight in the eyes. He's your partner. Say how you actually feel underneath. Farash... what's happening with you today? Drop all your fears. What's underneath? Unmask. I feel like you never let me feel. I feel like you're hiding me from the entire world, even from my own self, just 'cause of your own insecurities. I feel like every time I start to feel like myself, you punish me, 'cause you're scared to know who I really am. Maybe if you knew, you wouldn't love me anymore. I feel trapped. Trapped in a good Muslim and a good wife, and anything that makes you feel good. I feel I have too many impulses for my beliefs and my beliefs make it impossible for my impulses. Someone must have fucked up. And yes, I can say the word "fuck." It doesn't mean I want to fuck anyone. That's just how I feel in this moment right now. I want to feel whatever the fuck I want to feel, because here, my feelings are mine. My body is mine, my God is mine. I'm not just a tool to bring your babies to life. I'm also a storyteller that brings characters to life. And neither you or anyone else can take that away from me. I may not be able to raise my voice at you at home, but here, I'm giving a voice to characters that don't have a voice. So I can still feel alive. Farash, follow you impulse. Is Mom gonna turn into an ugly frog? Dad, who's that guy? Farash, you okay? Shit. Farash, Farash, can you breathe? Farash. Oh, my god. Somebody call 911. Get some water. Farash, he's still her father, I'm sure she's fine. But you just stay here until he calms down. I know his plan. He just wants to get me home. Farash. Listen, if he's that crazy, let's call the cops. And say what? "I cheated on my husband and I'm too scared to go home now?" Stop saying you cheated on him. -Fine. I'm gonna call the cops. -No. What if they take him? What am I supposed to do with a kid in a new city? And what am I supposed to tell Maryam? I'm sorry, I don't know. Farash, Farash, are you... Shit. It's him. Farash, it's him. -Hello? -Where is Farash? She can't come to the phone right now. Who the hell are you? It's Elise, the acting coach. Where the fuck do you live? It's none of your business where I live. Get my wife on the phone or I swear to you. Okay, calm down. I swear to God... He's just barking. Don't be scared. I can't, not over the phone. Tell him I want to meet him in person. -Okay, Saeed. -I swear on my life... Listen to us, yes, she's gonna meet you, just calm down. -Give me my wife... -She wants to meet somewhere in public. Don't make him angry. ...and I'll come right over there... Listen, Saeed, just listen to us. -Please calm down. -My ass. I don't need you to tell me what to do. -I'm the boss... -I need to make sure if Maryam's safe first. Get her on the phone now. She says she-- I said, get her on the phone now, or I swear to God, if she does not come home, she will never see Maryam again. Do you understand? Hello? He says if you don't come home, you'll never see Maryam again. Tell him if anything happens to Maryam... You have my daughter and I have your son. Come home right-- His son? Mom, Mom, where were you? -Mom, I missed you so much. -Hey, Mama, I'm here. I'm here now. Are you okay, are you all right? Yes, yes. I just couldn't sleep, even with the music box. I'm sorry, honey. I'm here now. -You're not leaving us? -Of course not. Of course not, Maryam. Then why did daddy cry all night? Why don't you go get some face paint while Mom and I talk? More spice... right? Right? Saeed, you have every right to be upset but I swear to God, it's not what you think it-- Don't swear to God again. -You're lucky you're pregnant. -People are watching. Now you're afraid of people watching? People, huh? What about God? You don't think God was watching when you were cheating on me? Quiet, I was not cheating. How are you loving couple doing today, huh? There's the menu, we have Devil's Kiss as special for today. We don't drink. Thank you. No problem, sir. We can make it a virgin if you want. I'll leave you guys alone for a few minutes. How can you come back home, and sleep next to me after all of that? It was just an acting class. -I needed to get to know myself. -Get to know yourself? At least now I got to know you. Saeed, you don't know me. You never even tried. Don't give me that acting bullshit. Did you have to fuck the guy, huh, in the name of acting? Okay. I'm not gonna let you talk to me like this. I'm leaving and I'm taking Maryam with me. Next time you leave, there won't be anything to live for. -Let go, Saeed. -Oh, I can let go. You can go, I just want to hold onto my son. -Let go or I'll scream, Saeed. -Please, the stage is all yours. Actress. What do you think of it, Mom? Do you like it? Yes, honey. I just think it needs more paint on it. Do you want some... you wanna paint too? My mom was right about this city. She said it would divide us. Saeed, you're the one building walls since we moved in. If you could only open up. Thanks. You've opened up enough for all of us. I told my mom you're pregnant. -Does she know about-- -No, she doesn't know about your cheating. We've decided that it's best for the baby if you and Maryam move back in with her while I work in the city. -It's safer. -What do you mean "We decided?" You go back to living in the community, like you did before, and everything will go back to normal like nothing happened. Nothing happened and I'm not going anywhere. -Farash, I'm forgiving you. -I don't need your forgiveness, Saeed. And if there is punishment, I'll let God do it, not me. I said I'm forgiving you. On one condition. What's this? This is to fix the trust you broke, to protect you. To protect me or to hide me? It's the only way, Farash. No, I'm not gonna let you censor my face. I swear to God, Farash, do not play with fire -or I swear to God-- -Or what? I'll make your life miserable, you'll never see Maryam ever again, do you understand me? You're gonna live alone on the streets. You think you're gonna go back to anybody, huh? You don't even have the family you left, huh? You're gonna go back to living alone. I saved you. I saved you. You'll never see Maryam again, do you understand me? Go and wear it. Bitch. -Thanks, Dad, for the ice cream. -You're so welcome, sweetie. Who's this? Don't worry, it's mommy. Mm, don't touch it. Eat your ice cream. We're celebrating mommy, daddy and all of us together again. Stop it. Finish your ice cream. Hey, stop laughing, it's not funny. Hey, shh, it's not funny. -Where are you going? -Lady's room. Don't take long. -And where are you running to? -If I can wear a hijab, then I can pee in the ladies room too. Farash? Farash? Hey, what the fuck are you doing? -Farash? -Yes, that's me. -That's your daughter? -Yes, Maryam. Hi. I'm sorry but you don't qualify to stay at the women's shelter. Clearly you're not under any threat, and we only accommodate women who are in immediate danger or mentally unstable. Sorry. Mama, just stay here. Excuse me. All right, hold on, stay there. Hey, do you think if you or your mom went home, that something might happen? Yes. She'll turn into an ugly frog. You can stay for a month max. Lights go off at 10:00, meals are announced over the PA. General bathroom is downstairs and there's a limit to one shower per day. And most importantly, no visitors without permission, especially men. Perfect. Okay, you're writing on a chalkboard. -You're... You're a teacher! -Nope. -Your mother. -No. - It's God, I win. - That's not fair. That's not fair, you can't play God. Yeah, you're supposed to do something we can see. -I can see God. Right, Mom? -Yes, honey. -Wanna play too? -No, you keep playing. I have to go pray. Could you please keep an eye on her? Don't worry, she's safe here. Farash. You're not good at playing hide and seek. Why are you shaking? Huh? You're scared of me? You should not be scared of me. Only God. You should only fear God. Are you talking to him now? Asking for forgiveness? Do you think he has forgiven you? Huh? Do you really believe he's forgiven you? Huh? Well, your God is certainly very forgiving. Mine is not. You want to be an actress? Fine, I'll do my job, you do yours. Leave my mom alone! Ow, Mom! Mom, my face! Mom, Mom, my face! What is it? Oh, my God, Farash. Mom. Maryam, your dress is ready. Maryam. Hi, Farash, it's Dr. Johnson. I hope you both are recovering well. I noticed you missed your appointment last week to remove your bandages. Can you please give me a call at the clinic right away? - Farash, it's Dr. Johnson again. I've been trying to reach you. It's very urgent that you remove those bandages. Can you please call me-- Hey, it's Elise. Everyone misses you. If you need any help-- Farash, I have some good news for you. Please come to the studio. -What are you doing? -I want to see how I look. No, what did I say? But, Mom, I can't wait anymore, it still burns. Don't you want to turn into a beautiful princess? Then you have to wait for the magic potion to work. To break the spell, like in the stories. Promise me you won't look again. I promise. Mom, is dad coming home for my birthday? I don't know. What are you drawing? It's you, me and dad. That doesn't look like me. Is dad coming home for my birthday? Mom, is dad coming home for my birthday? I said I don't know. -Are we still hiding? -Yes. The last time we ran off, you said we weren't hiding anymore. I lied, okay? Dad said, "If you lie, you go to hell." Your dad can burn in hell! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, honey. Sorry. I miss dad. Why can't you give him a clue so he can find us? Do you want to look like a princess for your birthday? Shouldn't we get Dad's permission first? We don't need anyone's permission anymore. -Pick any color you want. -Pink. Towards me please, princess. Where are your eyebrows? Let's draw you some eyebrows. So, what kind of princess do you want to look like? There's no red, but there's this color. This color, gimme this color. -Oh, I can't. -You'll like it. I think you need some hearts too. A big heart from Mama. A big heart from me. -My heart's bigger. -No. Yes. -You're a blue princess. -You look like a really creepy clown. Pink because I love "love." -Aww. -And I love you. -It's dad, it's dad. -Who is it? Mom, look. It's a script... script. Mom, I think this is for you. -What is it? -Go open your gifts, Mama. Make a wish. One more, one more, yay! - More. - That's good. No, I'm great. You don't like it? Oh, my God. You're a naughty birthday girl. -I'm gonna catch you. -No, please, no. -Birthday girl. -Mom. Here you are. I got her. I got her. I got her. What? Nothing. You have some cake on your face. Let's go change your bandages. But I don't have any cake on my face. Now you do. Let's go. Am I a princess now? You're already a princess. - Can I see? - Not yet, honey. Soon. Why are you crying? I've just... I've just never seen you so beautiful. Mom, is dad in heaven? Why would you ask that? 'Cause when people are gone for too long, and others cry, they say they're in heaven, like grandpa. I don't know. Daddy always wanted to go there. I'm not sure about him. But honey, you'll definitely go to heaven. Will he come with me? Mom? Dad said, I have a new playmate. Is it true? -Yes. -Where is he? -He's here. -Can I see him? No, but maybe you can hear him. -Hey, Mom, look what I found. -Why are you awake? I had a bad dream. I tried to wake up, but I couldn't. What dream? We were going through a tunnel. A very dark, one-way tunnel. I kept shouting "Mom, Mom, come back, it's a dead end!" But you couldn't see or hear anything. You kept dragging me along. I couldn't see or hear anything anymore. Suddenly, this butterfly sat on my face and woke me up. Isn't it beautiful? It is beautiful. Everything still is. Are you trying to torture me? Farash, is that you? Oh, my god, we've been-- -Are you trying to torture me? -Torture you? - What's this? - It's the script for the play. I know what it is. Do I look like I can act? -Listen, I just want-- -I want you to look at me, and tell me if I look like I can act. You're still my lead. It's not a reason to hide from the world again, Farash. The world that was already scared of me? Now they have one more reason to be scared. If they're scared of the mask, then show them who's behind it. Show them the real Farash. The real Farash did this to me. Maybe I deserve this. Maybe women like me are born to pray, not to play. Can you hear yourself? Now you sound just like your husband. -Excuse me? -Can't you see, Farash? He was using his faith to justify punishing you, and now you're using it to justify punishing yourself. You know nothing about my faith, nothing. I know your God is beautiful and loves beauty. And you certainly look more beautiful like this. -Are you out of your f-- -Say it, come on. -Are you out of your fucking mind? -Now, that's beautiful. You crazy bitch. That's the fucking Farash I'm talking about. - She's back. - -You're gonna regret to see who's back. - Wait 'til I catch you. - Oh, my God. I still don't understand why you're wasting your time. What's the point of you teaching me how to act if I can't even show my face? I'm not teaching you acting to act. Then what? I'm teaching you to teach. To teach? Yes, to teach acting. You're crazier than I thought. What's blocking you? Who's gonna take acting classes from a Muslim? It took a lot of courage for all of you to be in this class, to choose to be an actress as a Muslim woman. I want to end the term with a poem. "I believe in a beautiful God. A God who loves beauty. Play to Him as a prayer. He's needless of my duty. My God is a homeless one, yet His home is everywhere. He does not need a ending. Everywhere I look, He's there. My God does not live too far. He lives among every tree. His footprint is on the leaves. His breath is the dance of wind. My God does not fit in books. He lives in every man's eyes. He's reborn with every birth. He does not kill, nor He dies. My God's not a warrior. He's the artist and the art. My God doesn't need jihad. He conquers a willing heart. My God is not to kill for. He is the reason to live. Life is a gift He won't take. He only knows how to give. My God doesn't have a name. Not Jesus, Allah or Dao. He can't be named, only felt. I call Him, "Power of Now." My God never wears a mask. He is everything you see. His beauty is in you. His beauty is in me."
