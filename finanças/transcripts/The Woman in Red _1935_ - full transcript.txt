Line up, please. Class 27. Yearling saddle horses. Won by number 177. Number 177. Queen Of Maids. Ridden by Miss Shelby Barret. Owned by Mrs C.K. Nicholas. A splendid piece of horseflesh, my dear Nicko. That's a real compliment coming from you, Major. I'll add my sheaf of praises if I may. Isn't she a beauty, Johnny? She looks alright by me. Who is she? I'm talking about the horse, silly. Queen Of Maids. My equine choice. Out of Paulette. A spiffing piece of horseflesh. Second prize. One mile. Number 65. Brigador. Owned and shown by Mr Eugene Fairchild. Before announcing the next event. We take pleasure in introducing the Wyattville Polo Team. The eastern challengers. Who will play tomorrow against Chaparral. Congratulations. - Thanks. That's two blues you won today. Nicko certainly has all the luck. - Luck? To have you riding for her. - Oh... that's mighty nice of you, Gene. You made a grand show yourself. I was watching you. To see how far you'd extend yourself. Maybe I'll ride your string someday. You have a standing offer. - Thanks. I'm going back to Buck. Probably see you in the next class. Good luck. - I'll need it. Who's the girl you've got riding for you? Shelby Barret... a Professional. - Oh, a Pro? She doesn't look it. - She's not been professional very long. She does a mighty good job of it. I've never seen better riding. Hello Gene. Don't forget you're coming to my party tonight. Any time after ten. With your cousin of course. We'll be there. - Fine. Who is the one-girl show? - Eugene Fairchild's... cousin. You can give her a better looking-over tonight, Johnny. But... hands off. Are you always invited out to dinner? That depends. There was a time when I wasn't invited at all. I don't see why you let this bunch of snobs push you around... Because your sixth cousin didn't come over on the Mayflower. We haven't done so badly. Not for a family that started out in life carrying a dinner pail. Don't feel too sorry for me or for yourself. Like the show? - Thrilled to pieces. Gene Fairchild. Horseman, ladies' man. And oodles of new money. And actually works for it. Extraordinary. Yes, and very determined to buy his way in, so Nicko says. Shelby, you've simply got to win this for me. I'll do the best I can. Crozier entered Briary Bush. He's the only one that may take it away from me. Ah, which? - Number 7. Johnny, isn't that a stunning hunter? The best I've seen today. Have you ever seen him in action? - No, I haven't. But I've heard of him and I understand he's for sale. Oh, that's interesting. Won't you present me? - Oh, I'm sorry. Mr Wyatt - Miss Barret. Mr Wyatt is riding my ponies in the polo matches. Oh, really? A fellow professional. - No. Just a fellow. Why Shelby, you know Mr Wyatt's not... - Of course not. If I could handle a horse the way you do, I wouldn't mind being professional. That's very kind of you. Oh dear. He's in no condition to ride. Oh, see if you can stop him, Mooney. - Don't be silly, Shelby. Mooney, you're working for me. Not Mr Crozier. Come on, Johnny. "Fast number 50. Hunters. Thoroughbred." "To be shown over three jumps." "Post and rail, stone wall, and brush." "Number 7 first." "Number 7. Briary Bush." Well, that's one less to beat. Well, that's just rotten bad riding. What difference does it make? It means so much just to win. I like my blue ribbons. "Number 88 next. Mile high." "Miss Shelby Barret." My dear, I wish you would remember there are only five gaits. Walk. Slow gait. Trot. Rack and Canter. No reverse? Well, I've seen them back a horse up. And so the girl said: 'I want it too'. It's lovely, Nicko. - Thanks, dear. Welcome, stranger. How about a dance? Before you dance, do something for me, will you? Separate the Major and his wife for a little while. Because he's boring her to distraction. - I'll do my best. His wife married him. You didn't. Why should you stand for it? Now, Johnny. Don't be difficult. We'll dance later. That's a divine tune. Dance it? I'd love to. Well, what do you make of it? I can't think of anything the Wyatt clan needs more than an attractive widow. With plenty of money. That house of Johnny's on Long Island is going to collapse one of these days. If someone doesn't repair it. It was alright to ask her to dance, wasn't it? Of course. If you want to. I mean, you consider her a guest though you pay her to ride for you, don't you? Yes. But of course, I expect her to make herself useful. Any way she can. Sort of an assistant hostess to take care of all the boys. Exactly. And leave all the interesting men to me. Can't you see my dear girl, every time a rider hits back. Whether it's on purpose or by accident, mark you. Dash it, the horse's mouth is pulled. - Yes, of course. Yes, quite. Do you ride, Mrs Casserly? - I detest the beasts. I detest even the odor. And I practically live in the stables. I just can't imagine anybody feeling that way about horses. I've been brought up with them. I rode once. And discovered myself on the ground, holding the horse in my lap. Thank you. Keep your horses. And I still insist a five-gaited horse who backs up is a six-gaited horse. Take no notice of my wife. You know, she's a ridiculous woman. But it can't be disputed, Miss Barret. Ponies who persist in keeping a rigid pole while they rein all stop. Ruin their mouths in time, if one keeps them at fast polo. Yes. I reckon they do. Shelby, dear. Would you mind getting that photograph of Sistiana Chief in my bedroom? And put it on the desk in the library. - Surely. Hi there, Shelby. - Hello. Where is Nicko? Dan cut in. She wants me to bring my Ukulele down, but you know what? What? I will say a string is busted. Just naturally pulled a tendon. Why? You know how people are. Once you learn to put a billiard ball in your mouth... They make you do it so often it stops being fun. What? It's the same with the Uke. They want me to play all the time. It gets to be a business. Something you ought to be paid for. It's how you spoil anything that's fun. I get paid for riding, but being a professional doesn't spoil the fun. I didn't mean that. Listen, Miss Barrett. There's no room in my mouth for a billiard ball as my foot's always in it. Now let's start all over again. I like you. I like you a lot. You don't even know me. I know what you can do with a horse. And I know you've got lots of spunk. And I want you to like me. I'll tell you why. You see... I have a reason for everything. Has anyone ever told you that you have the gift of the gab? Oh, that's only one of my accomplishments. Good... I like to play polo. I'm pretty good on the Ukulele. Do you feel yourself being drawn towards me? Is that all you have to offer? Oh, no. No, there is health... Nobility of character. And a high spiritual nature. Well. You, I and your high, spiritual nature had better be getting downstairs. I suppose so. Do you live here in the house with Nicko? No, I have a little house down the road. It used to be the gardener's cottage. - I noticed it. Tell you what. - What? I'll bring my Uke down and play for you. Afraid you'd better not. Nicko won't like it. That would be too bad. I pay the lease. She pays me my salary, you see. Oh, Shelby dear. Gene Fairchild has just come in. Be a dear and see that he meets everyone, will you? Surely. - Thanks. Well Johnny Wyatt, another dance? We'll be talked about. Excuse me. Come here, Fanny. Oh, that's a lot of cupboard love. Now don't slobber all over me. There. No more. Oh, you're beautiful. But maybe you don't know it. Here. Hello. I saw you swiping the sugar, so I knew where you were going. You shouldn't have come here. I told you that you mustn't. You told me I mustn't go to the cottage. And play for you with my Uke. Well, is this the cottage? Am I playing the Uke? - You know perfectly well what I meant. Oh, come on now. Don't I even rate a piece of sugar or a pat on the head? There is a bar in the tap room if you'd like a drink. If you'll have one with me. Come on, I want to talk to you. Well, that's encouraging. What shall it be? - Scotch for me, please. Say. Nicko does pretty well by herself, doesn't she. Nicko has a habit of doing very well by herself. You can't tell me much about Nicko. She owns a place near Wyattville on Long Island. That's the town I come from. Thanks... here's to you. May I call you 'Shelby' instead of Miss Barret? And here's to you. - Johnny. Johnny. I'm glad I missed the party. This is much nicer. But it can't happen again. Oh, the old Nicko bugaboo, huh? I'm not aiming to tell you about Nicko. - Drop Nicko from the conversation. I think you're an awfully nice person. But I don't want you paying any attention to me. I'm just part of the scenery. I don't see why I shouldn't admire it. No. The only thing you give a hang about is polo. Sure... I love polo. I've played it ever since I was old enough to sit on a horse. My granddad played it. My dad, my uncles. A couple of old aunts. The game is part of me. But I still have an eye for the scenery. Drink up. Let's be going. Just because I ride Nicko's ponies. Doesn't mean I belong to her. Who said you do? I'm going this way, and you're going that way. Goodnight. - Goodnight, but first... We've been discussing a very important question that needs more talking over. Luncheon tomorrow? Luncheon tomorrow. Why Johnny... where have you been? Oh just strolling around... I'm in love. With the scenery. That was a beauty, Johnny. After you served it to me on a silver platter. What's the matter? Somebody missing? Come on. I've been telling my wife about the bad effect of a rigid pole on a polo pony. Oh yes. Yes. I concede there's some cold-jawed ponies with bent poles, and tender mouths. I concede that. That's very generous of you, Albert. Very generous. Oh Miss Barret. Miss Barret. You can buy Briary Bush for $3,500. - Thirty-five? That's a lot of money, but he's a lot of horse. Crozier is broke. Buy him. - You bet I will. How's this string going? - Oh, marvellously. Johnny is in top form, the dear boy. Why, Johnny. Will somebody please hit me in the head with a mallet. Come on. He may have got a bad bounce on the ball. I think he looked down here and saw me watching him. It's nerves. I had to take him in hand this noon, and give him lunch. Oh. What a dull afternoon. There hasn't even been a decent spill. Hi, Shelby. Hi there. Say, I've got some great news. Nicko is buying Briary Bush. No? I was going to see Crozier tomorrow and make him an offer. Haven't you enough horses? I'm afraid people like us never have enough. You're going to have to jump high, wide and handsome for blue ribbons this year. I had just about decided that red is my favorite color. While you're around, anyway. - So long. I don't like her. Why not? Always snooping around, trying to attract your attention. You're crazy. - Am I? I know women. I know human-beings pretty well. There's a square shooter. Did you see that miss of mine? - Miss? You didn't come close enough to call it a miss. What were you doing? Riding in the park. No... just looking at the scenery. Hiya, Shelby. - Hiya. Nice playing. Yeah. Of course I felt proud of myself when I missed that shot by an easy six feet. But that was your fault. - Mine? Uhuh. Just being there. That's what you do to me. I can't keep my mind on the game. - Nicko ought to put blinders on you. I hear you had a nice quiet rest for luncheon. Say, I was sorry about... - Oh, I understand. You got sudden orders from the boss. Oh... now, Shelby. Polo is your business and you have to keep business hours. I'm not meant to make snoots at you because you're a Pro, huh? You're a Pro yourself. Me, a Pro? - Yes. A professional amateur. You get hauled around the country by other people to ride their ponies. A professional guest. The only difference between you and me is I get paid for it and you don't. Hmm. That's telling me. I guess I'm not taking the game as seriously as before. When I saw you today, I didn't give a hoot about the game. That's high treason coming from a Wyatt. Polo is the most important thing in the world. Not always. So I see. But you haven't said how you like the string. Great. I'd give my shirt for that string. Oh, I guess you can have them if you want them, but... They'll cost you a lot more than your shirt. [ Car horn ] That's Nicko honking for you. You'd better run along. Give my compliments to our boss. Mush. [ Johnny: singing ] "Are the stars are out tonight?" "I don't know if it's cloudy or bright." "Because I only have eyes..." "For you, dear." "The moon may be high." "But I can't see a thing in the sky." "Because I only have eyes..." "For you..." I thought you went to the dance with Nicko. Right. And I'm back from the dance. Without Nicko. She won't like it. The most important thing I can think of is... do you like it? Perhaps... I was lonely. You know, that's just the way I felt about it. Come on out. You're too far away. You should have stuck the party out. Nicko will be furious. Now look... I didn't come all the way back here to talk about Nicko. Let's drop her from the conversation. We can't very well drop her when she's so set on marrying you. Says who? - Says I. Definitely. Well, she hasn't proposed yet. Let's be frank about it. You know she's in love with you. Alright, let's be frank about it. I don't love her. I never have. Now, let's be frank some more. You're the one I love, Shelby. With all my heart. I'd like to find one author who writes about how wonderful it is to be in love. I'd shoot him just for the fun of it. I've never been more miserable in all of my life. But I don't know what we're going to do about it. I know what we're going to do. It's only difficult to be sensible when you feel like this. I'm being sensible. No. It's no use, Johnny. What would we use to pay the bills? You couldn't drag me around the country while you're playing polo even if I go. You wouldn't get any more invitations, Johnny. No more room and board. No more strings of ponies for you to ride. No more d?butantes falling all over themselves on account of you. Don't you see it won't work? Are you saying 'no'? - I'm saying 'no'. Shelby, that 'no' doesn't make any sense at all. That's the trouble. It's the only thing that does make sense. You're wrong. I love you and you love me. That's all that counts and you know it. Don't you? I wasn't quite prepared for this. You've got nothing on us, Nicko. You can make other arrangements for the balance of the season, Shelby. I shan't need your services any longer. I believe we have a verbal contract. - Not that I know of. You'll get your pay and your fare back to Kentucky. I don't want anything from you. Now look here, Nicko. - You don't have to defend her, Johnny. No. I Just asked her to marry me. A Wyatt of Wyattville marrying a stable employee? That's what people will say, you know. And your family will probably love it, too. You're a rotten sport, Nicko. Come on. Get your things together. We're on our way. You're not going to play tomorrow? - Nope. You mean you are going to throw the team down? Certain things I have found are more important than polo. And you called me a rotten sport. Nicko. I'm fed up being a professional amateur. Now you get hold of one of my family. One who seems the least mad. Tell them Johnny Wyatt has resigned from polo until he can afford it. Don't you be long now. Shelby. Shelby. Do you want to wreck Johnny's chances of being the person he was intended to be? That's what you're headed for. You and I never did agree on many things, Nicko. I'm figuring on making Johnny's life for him. By the way. Crozier's secretary made the bill of sale for Briary Bush in my name. But you can mail him the check in the morning. Suppose you settle with Crozier. What does that mean? - I've changed my mind about the horse. So you would have me assuming a $3,500 obligation with exactly $35 to my name. And you call yourself a sport. - What are you going to do about it? I know one sportsman, thank goodness. Hello, Gene? This is Shelby. Listen, I'm in a jam. It's a bargain. I gather La Belle Nicko did you dirt. Well, I'm grateful to her. They'll cut off your phone for language like that. Thanks a million, Gene. Ready? - Uhuh. What's the idea of the horse? - Briary Bush. Briary Bush or not. I didn't expect to elope with a horse. Come on, darling. Throw in your tackle and I'll tell you all about it later. I hope you like the romance, old boy. The horse and trailer are in your stables. Here's the bill of sale, all signed. Nicko probably won't like it, but that's your lookout. Sure you won't change your mind and ride for me? No. Johnny Wyatt and I are going to be married. How thrilling. My best wishes to you both. Are you going all the way in this car? - No, we'll sell it and buy tickets. Where to? Yuma, Arizona. Then on to Wyattville. This will give the family the surprise of its life. I hope they'll like me. - They'll love you. The whole family will be lined up at the station to greet you. All aboard. Well. The family certainly turned out to give us a royal welcome home. I loved the brass band. - You do? The fellow with the big horn was out of tune. If that's the mayor over there getting ready to make a speech. Tell him to make it snappy. I'm tired. I guess they didn't get my wire. - Of course. How are you, Mr Wyatt? Glad to see you home again. Hello Joe. This is Mrs Wyatt. - Pleased to meet you. The old Wyatt homestead. Yes, sir. The right wing. Kitchen, living room and dining room. The left wing closed for repair. Here we go. It's an old Wyatt custom. Carrying one's bride across the threshold. Silly. Lots of people do it. Sure. But history records they filched the idea from us. Here we go. Hello. Hello, Cora. I rather expected to see you at the station. We got your wire, and put Mrs Agnew on the job as soon as possible. Well, Johnny really ought to introduce her. I'm Cora Furness. This is Mr Furness. Your housekeeper, Mrs Agnew. Glad to know you. If you'll excuse me, I'll see if I can find something for you to eat. That is, if I can keep a fire going in that rusty old stove. Your news sort-of took the family by surprise. They're not quite over it yet. You know, elopement. All that sort of thing. Are foreign to the family. Decidedly. Now you're here, we'll be running along. Yes. Oh, grandpa wants you for dinner tomorrow night. You'll come, of course? He's a bit upset you walked out on the polo team. A horrible breach of etiquette. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Oh Johnny, put your arms around me quickly or I'll throw up and bust. Now, now. None of that. You're tired and cold and hungry. And so am I. I dare say the ancestral home is equal to a cup of coffee anyway. Mrs Agnew, you certainly have given us a pleasant homecoming. I wouldn't say that, ma'am until you've seen the rest of your home. Hey. What way is that to wake up a guy? - Right effective. While you slept, I've been exploring our house. I have something to show you. What? Put on a dressing-gown for Mrs Agnew's sake. Do me a favor, Johnny Wyatt. Count them. I make it 36. - 18 pairs. Want to buy a centipede? And, ladies and gentlemen I direct your attention to this pitiful collection. One button and a half on this one. And as for this, with the severe Long Island winters. I got some nice gear down in the stables. Oh yes. Bits and crops and snaffles and saddles. But not a whole pair of underpants to your name. Oh Johnny, it scares me. We've got to go to work. Yeah, I know. I've got to find a job. Honestly, I don't know where to look for one. There's nothing here in Wyattville. We'll find one. Come on, get dressed. Breakfast is ready. And then you're going to show me over the Wyatt estate. Old Huntington Wyatt, an uncle of dad's used to raise trotters here. He was a funny old guy. He smelt of cigars and whiskey. Come on. I must look it over. - You'll get bats in your hair. Oh, I like them. Oh Johnny, look at it. I've looked at it for 25 years now. Man and boy. Oh you darling idiot. Can't you see? It's our job. How, for heaven's sakes? We both know horses and all about them. But there's no money in it. - Yes there is. Board them, train them. Everybody around here has horses. They're always going off to Europe or somewhere. Someone has to board the horses. They're always buying new ones that have to be trained for polo and shown. With your name... - You think we could...? I know we could. It would take dough. - Oh, we'll find it. Come on. You know, in my polo days. A thing like that, leaving a team during a series of matches. Was unheard of. Weren't people falling in love in your polo-playing days then? Ha? Match? Who left what match? Johnny sir, in California. Of course, we found it rather hard to understand. Hmm. Alright. Do tell me why you children were married in Arizona. Well, it takes three days to be married in California. I wanted to grab Shelby before she had time to think. Johnny is always in a hurry. We told him he should have come East and let us know. He never takes anything seriously. Running about the country getting married here, there and any other place. Oh come on. I only got married once. Johnny is taking something seriously now. We're going into business. - Huh? Oh... who is going into what business? Shelby and I, sir. - Shelby? Never heard of him. My wife, sir. We're remodelling the old stables. Fixing up the race track. - Look here, old boy. You're not serious? - Certainly. Why both you and Shelby would be professional horse trainers. I'm already a professional rider. You mean? Oh, I don't quite understand. I ride for money. Show horses for money. I'm very good at it. The little girl that Johnny married. Did... did she say she rides for money? Yes, sir. Oh, good. Yes. Very good, it serves her right. A pack of family-proud nincompoops. I'd dismiss it from my mind, if I were you old chap. Oh, it's still very vague of course. Why did you say our plans were vague? - Well, they are vague, sweet. But you made them hope we'd give the whole idea up. You pretty much gave them to understand we would. Oh, not at all. I don't know, Shelby. I don't like to... - Embarrass the clan? Exactly. Besides. They made it pretty clear I cannot look to them for finance. Oh Johnny, darling. Don't give in so easily. If they won't help us we'll get it somewhere else. Where? - I'll write granddad in Paducah. He's not so well-to-do but he is the most generous man alive. But Shelby... even if we could get the money. Careful, sweet. Did you hurt yourself? Oh no. I just bumped my lowdown, professional shin... On part of the Wyatt roof that's lying rotted on the ground. Shelby. You're not angry at what they said? Oh no. I love to be looked at like I had fleas. Don't mind them, sweet. I know they're fogeys, but they're my family. Johnny, promise me to go ahead. Get estimates on the work and then let me write granddad. Please. But Shelby, they are my family. - And I'm just your wife. You bet you're my wife. Oh Johnny. I hate to be mad with you. And if you let me down on this, I'll have to be mad. You and I, mad at each other? Oh, no. Oh Johnny, don't just be a Wyatt. Be my Johnny that I love. Alright, Mrs Agnew. Now we have to kind of ease it on. [ Doorbell ] Never mind the doorbell, hang on to the paper. Oh, it has to go a little higher. Oh, hang it all... that's no good. Oh dear. Nicko. Well... This is a surprise. That's an old line, but it seems to fit. We were pretty angry with each other, weren't we? Were? - Well, I don't blame you. Not that I'm apologizing, you understand. Oh, I understand. Well, after you left. - After I was fired. I didn't win another blue ribbon. If that's any satisfaction to you. - So nice of you to admit you missed me. Well, I do admit it. Now, tell me everything. What everything? - About you and Johnny, silly. I suppose you're divinely happy? - Oh, divinely. Hello. Hello, darling. Why Nicko, I just heard you were in town. Johnny, you two romantic children never gave me a chance to wish you happiness. We really don't need wishes, Nicko. I want you to try out a string of polo ponies I just shipped in. Fine. Any time you say. But now it will cost you money. Easy-going Johnny. A 'Captain of Industry'. What's so darned funny about that? I like being a businessman. Besides. We only got the idea about three days ago and work is already under way. Well, wonders never cease. Good luck. - Thanks. We may need it. Come over and have dinner, you two. Any time. Johnny Wyatt a 'Pro'. I've never heard of such a thing. The Wyatt family never heard of it either. Get together with them. You'll all have a lovely time. I might do that. Goodbye. - Bye. What are we going to use for money? Well... maybe we'd better get in touch with your granddad in Paducah, Kentucky. See what they're using out there. - I'll write him tonight. Johnny, Johnny. Yeah? - Come look at what we've got. Hey, what a peach. You didn't steal him, did you? - No, a wedding present. From who? Granddad in Paducah? - No. It's Briary Bush. Don't you remember? The elopement horse. Only he's a wedding present now. Read that. Listen sweet... that's an awfully big present to take from Gene Fairchild. Oh it doesn't mean much to him. He owns a mint. I don't think we should. - But he'll be hurt if we send him back. People like to talk. I'd rather not give him the chance. Let them talk. Remember this, Gene will be around soon with a string of ponies. That means business for us. He's always wanted me to ride for him. Sometimes I wish we hadn't entered this business. Can't back out now. - How are we going to take care of him? I'm a better stable boy than a paperhanger. If we don't hurry up, two of the best people won't get to the club party. Coming, Johnny. Gene Fairchild moves to Wyattville. And is elected a member of the yacht club before he has time to unpack. Yep, a full-fledged member. All because he's shelling out for a new yacht basin. Sometimes my family makes me laugh. It's kind of funny. Speaking of money. I got those estimates today. Oh Johnny, how much? - I'm afraid we're sunk. Nine thousand dollars. I suppose your grandfather will stand for the extra two? Well, he... He probably can give us the nine as well as the seven. Something I didn't tell you. I put up our land as a guarantee of this payment. You mortgaged the land? - The same thing. I had to, before they'd start work. But we can't quit now. If I don't make the payment we lose the land. Oh, Johnny. You should have told me. Yes I know. But I was so anxious to take hold and start things off with the bank. I wanted to prove your faith in me. And now I've fixed everything swell. If your grandfather says no, we're in the soup. He won't. We'll get the money. But, Johnny. Always remember we're partners. And that we must never do anything without telling each other. That's a promise. Thanks for that one, Mrs Wyatt. - I love dancing with you. Oh, there is aunt Jean over there. I guess I'd better go over. Do you mind if I don't? That's my yacht. Third from the left, only I'm not on it. Gene, how are you? - Hello, Shelby. Why haven't we seen you? When are you going to call on Johnny and Briary Bush and me? Whenever I'm asked. I've been busy getting admitted into Wyattville. But now I am admitted... Gene, why do you bother to buy your way into Wyattville? I wanted to be near Briary Bush. Oh... a yacht basin for Briary Bush? Ha, no... no, that's business. Did you ever hear of Fairchild & Son, private bankers? Who hasn't. Well, I am they, and they are I. That is father and I. And hurray for grammar. Well, what's that... - I'm their social contact. These people are customers of ours. Others want to be customers of us too. Oh, I see. Smart businessman. - Uhuh. Sometimes. Well, that's that. Let's talk about Shelby. Let me look at you. I want to be sure. Johnny Wyatt is taking good care of you. - Only the very best. I was afraid of that. - Afraid? I'd like nothing better than to find you wan and weary. Then I could dash to the rescue. I'm in no need of rescuing, Gene. That is, I... How are you at giving out advice? As a businessman. Very good. Why... trouble? No. Not exactly. You see. Johnny and I are in business, too. But not so smart. - Business? Ride with me in the morning. And I'll tell you a long, long story about my granddad in Paducah. Your what? I think it's a cinch to win the 12-metre class this year. A good boat. There's Shelby with that rude pirate, Gene Fairchild. And I can't quite understand that chap selecting Wyattville as a place to live. Oh, I can. Hope dies hard. First he sends her that horse. Which I was going to buy. And Gene grabbed from me in the most bare-faced way. Are you fond of cats? Never mind. Just look over there. Excuse me. I have work to do. Gene generally buys what he wants if he can't get it any other way. Oh hello, dear. - Nicko, I'd like to talk to you. Excuse us. - Surely. I had the feeling the other day that you didn't want to talk to me at all. This won't keep. Shelby, need we take a cross-country hike? Nicko, I'm going to talk mighty fast and blunt. I want you to stop spreading lies about me. What are you talking about? - You wanted Johnny. I got him. Knowing your high standards of sportsmanship. It's no surprise to me that you're a bad loser. You want Johnny's family to believe dirty gossip of me and Gene Fairchild. I'm warning you to shut up and take your loss like the lady you're not. Sign a note if you like. Three months. I'll charge you 5% on your money. The only thing I asked you down here to give me, was advice. The only advice I can give you is to let me put up the money. Loaning money is part of my business. You make it real easy for me. Putting it on a real business basis like that. You wouldn't want it any other way. - Thanks for realizing it. Shelby. Where are you? - In here. In the tub. Did you get the money? - Wait a minute. What? - I said, you get the money? Yes, sir. I'll have it in cash tomorrow. - Great. I heard today the Curtis Bunkers in East Woollaston are going south for 6 months. I think we can get their whole string to board for the winter. This infant business of ours is beginning to cut its teeth. Oh Johnny, isn't it grand. I'm going to Woollaston to see them for the weekend. Will you miss me? What do you think? I think you can come in and dry my back. Because I love you and we're going to be big business successes. Wyattville 229. Yes please. Hello. Hello, Shelby? Fine, thanks. Shelby, I'm giving a party on the boat tonight. I wonder if you and Johnny could come along? Oh, he's out of town? Woollaston? The big horse deal? Oh, that's grand. Look, Shelby. You come then. - No, Gene. Thanks just the same, but I'd rather not come without Johnny. You wouldn't want an extra girl anyway. - But I do, Shelby. As a matter of fact I'm asking a favor of you. The man who is going to be associated with me in that big deal. He and his wife are coming aboard. It's important for me to have some darned attractive guests. That means you, of course. That's mighty sweet of you, but... I'd rather talk it over with Johnny. - Do that, Shelby. Really, it's very important. I've never asked a favor of you before. I'm asking one now. Alright. Hello. I want East Woollaston 450. This is Wyattville 229. Hello. Is Mr John Wyatt in the hotel? This is Mrs Wyatt. Oh. No thank you. It's not important. Wyattville 229. Shelby? - Hello, Gene. I couldn't get hold of Johnny. But if I'm really necessary to your campaign, why of course I'll come. Alright, I'll come aboard at Huntington tonight at six. Thanks, Shelby. That's great. The race today was a test. - Then we won't count that one. Ha-ha... Hello, Nicko. - Oh, hello. Don't get up, please. Join us for a cocktail. - Thanks, I can't. I've guests coming. You've plenty of time. If I drive from here to Wyattville in nothing flat, I'd still be late. Tell me, how is the high life in Huntington? Same as usual. Nothing has changed in this town within the memory of man. We'll have the cocktails another time. Goodbye. Goodbye, Nicko. A charming girl. - Yes, she is. Welcome to the White Bell. It's not so bad, is it? - It's nice. It really is. I just had to have you, Shelby. If I can swing this man due to you, it will be a tremendous deal for me. Mrs Good ear is a climber. And well... You are a Wyatt. - I'm afraid the Wyatts don't think so. That's why I have to be so careful and proper. I understand. You're in a touch spot. It's awfully exasperating sometimes. By the way, I wanted to tell Johnny that you gave me the money, but somehow... I know. Who all is coming? We're going over to Greenwich to pick up the Goodyears and to pack some drums. You'll excuse me, won't you? We're not officially under way until the owner's on the bridge. Aye aye, sir. I'll teach you how to salute when I get back. Radiogram, sir. All through playing 'Admiral'? - For a little while. There's always things to worry about aboard a boat. I just worry about you now. Alright, where shall we begin? - Anywhere you say. Shelby, I'd give my right arm for the chance to make your life all can to be. But my life's alright. It suits me fine. No. You're grubbing around in a tumbledown house full of snobs. Trying to launch this pathetic little horse business. Oh please, Gene... How long before we're in Greenwich? Just a little while. Well this came from Pax Drumm. He can't make it. But Mrs Goodyear will be along. That will make us chemically pure. There is Greenwich just ahead. I've never been there, but... I guess I can wait until the next time. Thanks. You're a real sport for staying. Shelby, you can always depend on me. Thanks, Gene. You know, I don't believe those Wyatts appreciate what very nice people we are. I'm sure they don't. White Bell ahoy. Goodyear coming aboard. Hey, Gene. Gene. Hoo. Gene. Hi, Gene. How's the old kid? How's the horses, horses, horses? I thought you were bringing your wife. - Yeah... I'll take scotch. He's mad and I'm glad. Scotch without soda, scotch without anything you got. Scotch without a wife. What difference does it make whether my wife is here or not? I can talk business just as well without her. Better. Better at business. - Of course. Only I hadn't expected... Oh rubbish. What's she up for anyway? For lottery, for love. I love you. Gene, are you going to keep us standing on deck like the burning boy all night? It doesn't look that way. All tired and sweaty. He's worked so hard. He's all wore out. He's cockeyed. Well... as I live... If that isn't our own professional rider. That's a laugh... I mean... You're trying to hang on to a good thing, eh? Nice work. Congratulations. Listen baby... when he's had enough and wants to show you the gangplank. Come round to me. I'll give you some advice. There's a lot of men. Real big-shots, just waiting for the right... And they will let you ride their horses. Ahh... ow! Hey... what's the idea? Just trying to offer some high-priced friendly advice. And I get treated like a leper. Shelby, I'm sorry. Steward. Help me with Mr Goodyear. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Where's my Goody, Mr Caveman? Forget it. He's been put to bed. I thought you were rehearsing a show. - Oh, I quit it cold. They didn't appreciate me. Goody is going to give me a swell part. Maybe with George Sanders. Ha-ha. He's crazy about me too. A lot of men are. Aren't you sorry you chucked me out, Gene? What was your idea in coming aboard? You knew it was my boat. I just wanted to see how you'd take it. - Cut it. Oh, so it's the little girl on horseback, eh? Listen to me, Olga. If you mention her again, I'll lose my temper and give you a bath in the sound. Old cousin Gene. Ha-ha... [ Door knocks ] Shelby... it's Gene. Open the door. I wouldn't have this happen for the world. You do believe that? - Yes. But I want to go ashore. - As soon as we're opposite Shoreham. That will be in about 15 minutes. You can take the jitney from Shoreham to Wyattville. If this gets around, I don't know what will happen. It won't get around. Come on out on deck. We'll look for those Shoreham lights. Hey, Gene. What's the matter with the people on this boat? They're all dead. Oh, you two go right ahead. Don't mind me. Remember what I told you. - Whoops... I'm sorry. Don't I get anything to drink? - No. Poor Gene. Do you make love on cold water? Ha-ha. Oh... I beg your pardon. Ooh. You've got rotten ventilation on this ocean. I'm simply gasping. Get down somewhere. Right away. Oh... what for? - Because I say so. It's better than sitting on that rail. - What's a rail for but to sit on? Stay there or I'll have you locked in your cabin. Whoo. Shelby, I'm sorry. You chatter like a rabbit. Stand by. Passenger overboard! Man overboard. My pal. This is the most accommodating jail I was ever in. Gene, how can they think you ever killed her? They won't think so for long. A small-town grand jury trying to crash the New York papers. I'm going to testify. Come to court and get your name smeared all over the papers? One thing I did was get you off the boat without anyone aware you'd been aboard. Don't undo that. Why, the trial will be over in three days. You're awfully confident. - You bet I am. Now go home and don't come here again. I don't want to see you until all this is over. Then I'll come looking for you. Raise your right hand and be sworn. Do you swear to tell the truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God? Sure, I'll tell the truth. I always tell the truth. Me, I don't care who likes it or who doesn't like it. That's right, Mr Ericson. Just answer to the best of your ability the questions put to you. Sure. I tell everything I've seen. Your full name is? - Niels Ericson. Wasn't it grand? The handmade day. Darling, must we go in? - To breakfast? Why, sure. Grandfather gets a great kick out of seeing us all come in after the hunt. You go, but I'd rather go home. What's the matter, darling? Don't you feel well? Say, you look kind of white around the gills. Johnny, I want... - Wasn't it glorious? Poor old Gene would have loved it. He always liked dressing up to give his flawless imitation of a gentleman. Nicko, you have a wicked tongue. Well, we had a fine run, sir. - Ran? Ran where? We did, sir. The hunt, you know. We had a capital run. Yes. How long? - Point to point of seven miles. From here to Hadley Wood. Ah, good. Mr Fairchild pushed her. He knocked her down the after companionway. Part way. You saw him push her down the stairs? They call it a 'companionway' on a ship, not 'stairs'. You witnessed this? - I don't say nothing I didn't see. The other lady with the coat on, was beside Mr Fairchild. That lady said something to her, and Mr Fairchild pushed her. Shelby, you've nothing to eat. - Oh, please. I'm not hungry. Everybody is hungry after a hunt. - Shelby. Shelby... didn't it strike you funny, riding Briary Bush? With poor old Gene down there at the courthouse. What fascinates me is, the missing girl in the red coat. Why doesn't Gene get her to testify? Oh, it's probably some poor kid who got mixed up in the rotten mess. Gene is trying to shield her. - Perhaps she's married. Maybe her husband thinks she was home-alone that night. Playing solitaire. - No, I don't think that's it. They don't go in much for chivalry, fellows of that type. Gene was an alright type to be a member of the Wyattville yacht club. Why Shelby, you sound positively vicious. Is your heart bleeding for Gene? Gene is one of the squarest, kindest men I've ever known. She was sitting on the rail. Mr Fairchild went to her, put his hands on her arm, and gave her a shove, like. And the next I saw, the lady was in the water. It won't surprise me if they fry him. Never. Don't you think he's guilty, Johnny? - Darned if I know. They haven't a case. I don't agree with you at all. In the first place they've established a motive. Olga shook him down for plenty of money. She was probably planning to shake him down for more. Naturally, he wanted to get her out of the way. And he was probably in love with this girl in the red coat. Olga came aboard the yacht uninvited. And interrupted a budding romance. I bet you ten dollars they get a verdict against him. Not first degree necessarily, but a verdict. Manslaughter perhaps. I'll take that bet. Johnny, you can't bet, you... Why not, Shelby? Are you shocked at their betting? Doesn't any one of you realize what it must be like for Gene? You've accepted his hospitality. - Not on the yacht. He never invited any of us. Not me, anyhow. What about you, Johnny? And you, Shelby? The young lady in the red coat. Who was a stranger to you. Who is a complete stranger to me as I have repeatedly told you. Now to the later incident. When Miss Hungerford was on the rail. You heard the testimony of Mr Ericson. Do you deny again that you pushed the girl harder than you meant to? I do deny it. Well, it looks as if the Fairchild case is all over except the verdict. A chap from the office phoned me. The case goes to the jury this afternoon. I told you they had no case against him. You're wrong there, my dear. It's Fairchild's word against the word of the Mate, who saw the whole business. It looks bad for Fairchild. I suppose it's the girl in the red coat. She could clear him alright, if she'd only step forward. If you ask me, she couldn't clear him. That's why she's staying under wraps. Probably a bright young thing with an eye to business. I'll bet Gene is paying her plenty to keep out of it. You cannot say Wyattville hasn't come through with its yearly scandal. But Shelby, why are you looking so downhearted? Win, draw or lose. Our mysterious lady in the red coat... comes out ahead. You people are horrible. There isn't one decent, generous thought in your heads. Shelby. - Don't touch me. Shelby's upset. She's very fond of Gene. - Yes. I was fond of him. Not in the way Nicko would like you to believe, either. I liked him. He was a straight-shooter. More than you can say for any of you. Shelby, please. - I despise the whole lot of you. I'd rather associate with a bunch of stable boys. I'm going to the court now to help him because I was the girl in the red coat. And how do you Wyatts like that? I knew it. When Mr Goodyear, boarded the yacht with Miss Hungerford. What did he say? What he said made very little sense. He was terribly drunk. As I remember, he wanted another drink. And where, at this moment, was the lady in the red coat? I'm the girl in the red coat. Mrs John Wyatt. The high-and-mighty Wyatts never got mixed up in anything stronger than tea. The next moment, the yacht rode a swell. She lost her balance and fell overboard. That's all. And you're positive the defendant did not lay hands on her? To push her off the rail? Positively not. It's ridiculous. Thank you, Mrs Wyatt. That's all. Please. Your witness. Mrs Wyatt. Will you preface your interesting story of Miss Hungerford's accidental death... By enlightening us to the circumstances under which you first met the defendant? Why, of course. I was... The whole Wyatt family are on the warpath. Tom, they're hard. By their looks they're with you. Better get in action, Mike. It's the first time the Wyatt tribe's been seen without their horses. Order. Order. I must have order in this court. You will continue, please. - Your Honor. Answer my question, if you please. What... what was it? I asked you for the circumstances under which you first met the defendant. I was riding professionally in California. Mr Fairchild had a number of entries, and we met there. What was the nature of your relations with the defendant? We were merely friendly competitors. That's all. What have your relations been with the defendant since he came to Wyattville? The same. Isn't it true, Mrs Wyatt... That the defendant presented you with a very expensive horse? I object, Your Honor. Immaterial. - Not the least, Your Honor. We'll get some dirt in this case yet. - You said it. I intend to establish that the witness... Is so under obligation to the defendant that she's prejudiced. You may follow that line of questioning. Mr Fairchild gave me... Gave us a very expensive horse as a wedding present. What was the value of that horse? About $3,500. Your husband was well acquainted with Mr Fairchild? No, I... Don't believe he was. Oh, then the gift was really for you? - No. Did he ever present you with any other such little tokens of his esteem? Never. Now, Mrs Wyatt. Aside from the horse the defendant gave you... As a wedding present. - Of course. Aside from that. Were you under obligations to the defendant? Answer the question. Answer the question. Answer me, if you please. He was so to kind to help my husband and me financially in a business venture. And to what extent did the defendant render this financial aid? The extent of several thousand dollars. - Do you recall the exact amount? $9,000. It was for... - Yes, we understand. It was for a business venture. This help was rendered with the full knowledge of your husband, of course? No. Yet you say it was a business venture? With you and your husband? Yes. - Now, Mrs Wyatt. I want you to tell us if, on the night in question, you went aboard this yacht. With the knowledge and consent of your husband? I object, Your Honor. If it please, Your Honor... The prosecution attempts to discredit the witness. By proving she was engaged in a clandestine affair with the defendant. And consequently is obliged to defend her own name and to defend his as well. I don't care what you and the whole world believes of me. I was there. I saw a bad accident for which you try to send an innocent man to his death. What difference does it make who I am or what I am!. Gene Fairchild is innocent. That's all that counts! Order. Order in the court. You will disregard the unethical conduct of the witness. She certainly cut through a whole spool full of red-tape with that eruption. In that case I ask, the court for a recess. The surprise witness will considerably alter the aspects of the case. The court declares a recess of one hour. We'll put Johnny on for our surprise. If he knew all about this he wouldn't have kept silent. Hold it right there, Mrs Wyatt. Did your husband know you were on that yachting party? Why don't you ask me that question? - Well, did you? Of course I knew it. - Young man. No wife of a Wyatt family ever went any place without her husband's consent. I saw her at the docks myself. - Absolutely. This is no occasion for publicity. Oh no? Wait until you read the morning papers. You can kiss your murder goodbye as it's out of the picture. Put Wyatt on the stand. It'll make a hero out of Fairchild. The Wyatts stick together like flypaper. Hey, the legal department is getting together. I smell a dismissal. Five dollars says so. Case dismissed. Fairchild case dismissed. I don't mind telling you things were looking pretty black when you came in. When I looked up and saw you there. It meant a lot to me to know you cared enough. To see it through. Don't get things mixed up, Gene. How do you mean? It's just that I never could have held my head up again if I hadn't done it. It was something I had to do for myself. Not for me? I see. So, it's still Johnny? - No. No. This morning I managed to cut myself off from Johnny once and for all. But he came into court and stood by you. That was the Wyatts putting up a front to the world to save their cussed pride. No. Johnny's through with me. And you love him? Of course. Why, he's... He's Johnny. May I take you home? - No thanks. I have my car. You're a great sport. And so are you. Hey, you. Get in. Well come on. Get in. Now what do you want to cry for? You know you never have a handkerchief. Here. Blow. Remember saying to me, we're partners? We must never do anything without asking each other first? Well young lady, I guess we're even now. Oh Johnny, is it alright? Of course it's alright. It's better than that. But from now on, we're partners. A closed corporation. Nobody else counts. Nobody but us. Come on, honey. This partnership has some unfinished business to attend to. FxMar22
