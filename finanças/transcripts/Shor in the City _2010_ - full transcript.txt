Alright, I'll go check. - What is it? - Give me the paper. Let me see his face one more time. He's the one, isn't he? You remember his face, don't you? - You bet! It's etched in my memory. Food, booze, money. The scent of all three together! This is life! Hey, don't create a scene. Let's just go stand in a corner. Come on. Come.. Why are these people written about in page 3? Because the important news gets printed in the first two pages! Would you care for some bubbly, sir? - What? Bubbly? Who's Bunty then? Excuse me, sir? Let the apple juice be, get me some whiskey. Sir, large or small? Are you going to pay up? Get me a large, and quick! - Okay, sir. - And listen.. Yes? - Keep coming back every five minutes. Now get going, quick! - Stand straight. - Alright.. - Tilak.. - Don't fidget around. He is getting ready to leave. He has started saying bye to everyone. Let's get out of here as well. Very nice meeting you guys. Nice meeting you. Sir, your drink. What is it? What are you staring at? And what are those gloves for? Are you going to bat after duty hours? Sir, just check.. Hey, stop! Hello, listen.. The tire is probably punctured. Pull over. Check if there's a puncture. - Go, go, go.. - Get in. - Stop.. What's going on? - Don't move. Who are you? What's going on here? Shut up! Look ahead, come on! Okay.. Don't hurt me. You guys can.. What are you doing? Put that back on. Come on. He's offering it willingly. We should take it. You idiot, let's just take what we want. Got it? - You are right. - What do you guys want from me? - A copy of your new book. - But that's not published yet! That's the reason we are here. We hear there's a war among publishers to publish your book. Let them fight. We're going to publish your book first. Just give us the copy. Hello. Saroja, it's me. There's a copy of the final manuscript.. Yes, the one on the desk. I'm sending a guy, give him the copy. Don't ask questions, just do it, okay? I'm sending him right away. Yes. What are you staring at? Are you going to memorize my face to describe to the cops? This kidnapping business.. Are you a regular at it? No, it's our first time. Doesn't seem so. Thanks. - There he is. - Here it is. We got it! Show it to me! This is cool! You aren't handing us something else, are you? It's going to be published in your name. Your reputation will be ruined for nothing. - Let's go. - Quick. - Let's get out of here. - Run. What the.. "Don't do any childishness! Your deeds are visible to all."

"It'll halt you and kill you." "You'll certainly lose. This karma is a bitch" Where are the delivery guys? I thought they were supposed to be unloading this. I don't know, sir. They just dropped these and went off somewhere. Alright, fine. We will do it ourselves. Did you check the orders? Is everything there? Yes. Sir, you don't have to do this. I'll manage. - No, it's okay. - Sir.. It's okay, you take that one. The one there. - Sir, let me do it. - No, it's okay. Please. Let me do it, leave it to me! - Leave it. Don't worry, sir. Go on inside and enjoy the air-conditioning. Who is this guy? Does he work in the building? Does he work here? I don't know, sir. Never seen him before. Okay, bye. Have a good day. Okay.. So, thanks for your help. But.. That's it. From the outside, this building looked bad. But from the inside, it looks all cool. Looks like you're setting up a huge business. No, it's a small.. Small business. You have lived abroad, haven't you? Where have you come from? Are you new to the city? What's the matter with you? Just leave. - Really? - Yes. Alright, you carry on. I'll follow. What? What? Come on, sir. You're a wealthy man. I didn't go to work because of you, sir. - What? Are you kidding? And now it's too late. I would've made six times this much, sir. It's unbelievable. Okay, look. I didn't ask for your help. And we were doing this ourselves. This is not right. - Sir.. - This is all that I have. Okay? Now, please. Just go. Alright, sir. Wish you very good luck. And, sir.. I have a friend.. ..who is really good at setting up businesses. I've already told him about you. No, no, no.. I do not need any help. Sir, he'll handle your business. Thank you. Just please go. He'll provide you security. He's really good. - No, man. Just.. - Think about it, sir. He is the best. On the crease is batsman of Tendulkar XI Alok Chaturvedi. Crap! Just at the right time he plays like a superstar! - He'll get on the team for sure! - You are right. It's over for us. Look at the selectors. Just look at them! They're watching every ball being bowled. Do your best. We need to put our best foot forward. There are going to be only three selection matches. We can't mess up in even one. Else, we'll be under pressure in the other two matches. The pressure is on us. Why are you making me worried? Let me go play in peace. Crap! I should have played better! I lost my chance. I should have just whacked every ball! Who cares for technique these days! No chance of me getting selected now. It'll all be fine. Don't worry too much. My chances of making it are zero! And you know it too! So stop consoling me. Crap! We do have a problem. What have I been saying all this time? You didn't get me. Listen.. We need to do something. Can't just sit around. We need some sort of guarantee. What crap! Who will give me guarantee? Do you have good contacts with any of the selectors? Too bad, man. Don't you have any photos in modern outfits? There are few. Let me check. Here you go. Did you like it? As you wish. Do you wish to ask her anything? Yes.. What are your hobbies? I don't have any hobbies. - No hobbies! - No. I don't know. Get Robin's bike. I can't take my scooter. Mom's hidden the keys somewhere. Savvy, please do something. Please get me out of here. Everyday, they truss me up in front of some joker like a showpiece. They're going ahead fixing my wedding without even asking me! Please, Savvy, come soon. Are you coming or not? It's paining. Savvy, my lips are dry, it's paining, man, please! So.. when will they announce the final cricket team? Told you, next week. Next week for sure? How many times will you ask me? What to do? There's so much tension at home. I am going crazy. I will be relieved once you get selected. I was wondering.. You should talk to someone. Talk to whom? Someone influential, who might be of some help.. Please, Sejal, don't start again. I am way too stressed already! Okay, sorry. I said, I'm sorry. Okay, I won't say a word. Alright? Show it. - Nice click. - Right. Enough, guys. I got to go. Come on! Let's have one more shot! We just started. Sapna is alone at home. Why don't you understand? True! Now that you have a wife.. ..why would you care for old friends? One more. Last one, I promise. Fine, last one. That's like it. Hi! What's up! Nothing. You tell me. Nothing. Just hanging out. You? Just hanging out too. - So, can I.. - You can buy me a drink. - Thanks. - Of course. Do we know each other? No. Why are we acting like we know each other? Well, you started it. So what do you do? I see, you are a model. So, what do you do? I've been gone from India long time. But.. I'm moving back to start a small business. Oh! You are one of those. One of who? You know, those.. I'm going to try and stay in India types. Excellent! I'm already a stereotype. Hey! You should see her with her uniform off! What an item! There he goes again, Tilak! I have seen her from top to bottom! The only person you've seen top to bottom is yourself! - In the mirror. - I am not joking. I've really seen her that way. She hasn't even looked at you once! She's just showing off in front of those english speaking fools! Like she doesn't know me! Fine, what's her name? Come on, tell me. I don't remember, man. What's in a name anyway? I swear.. ..I took her into that room next door! What? You need proof? What proof will you get? A signed affidavit from her? Shall I bring her here right now? Just say the word! I'll go bring her right now. Just give your nod. - Fine, go get her. - Go, go, go! Have you seen the molestation scene? It was great! Excellent! - You know.. - Hello. I don't know him. Hello! What! What's up, dude? What do you want? I want to talk to her. Crazy fellow. Look, he's coming back. So how do you like the city so far? Everything's changed. The city is not the same anymore. Well, is it better or worse? I don't know. I'm thinking about it. I'm Abhay. And you are.. I'm thinking about it too. "In this world" "people often" "misunderstand things." "Without one's knowledge" "one's heart gets stolen." "In this world" "people often misunderstand things." "Without one's knowledge.." These are the wedding gifts. They've been lying around for a while. I had nothing to do, so I just opened them. Anything of use or same old boring presents? Well, there are four clocks, six Lord Ganesha idols and there's this grinder. Good, at least there's one useful thing. There was no grinder at home. Yes, but there's masala on it. They must've flicked it off some place. - What? Nothing. Pass me those envelops. There's no money in there. They're empty. What? You took it all? No. They were always empty. Before I even opened them. Who brought all of this home? Your friends. Mr. Mandook and Mr. Ramesh. I need to leave for work. I'll be late while returning. You're in the book business, right? Yes, we print books. - Publishing business. - Can I come see the office? Not today. I have a meeting with a client. It's an important meeting. - Can I help you, sir? - Sorry? - No.. - Have you read this book? - Is it good? - Very good, sir. They're making a Hollywood film based on this! - How about this one? - This one's good too. How's this selling? What? Well, that's in demand too. - I see. Would you like to buy something, sir? - Pack this one. - Okay. Wait a minute. - This one too? - Even this. This one.. Are you sure, you want to buy all these, sir? - All of it? - Pack these. Are you sure? - Of course! Go on and pack them. Okay, sir. Are these books heading to Bandra? - Yes, sir. Chotu, bring the new books inside. Bhupi.. ..find out when we're getting that Chintan Gandhi book? Okay, sir. - Hey, come here. - Yes, sir. Why are some pages missing here? Oh, we just missed printing a few pages. Don't worry. No one will know. Who reads a book completely anyway? What? We're in the business of selling books. Just because we sell at half price doesn't mean we sell half books. Sir, the customer will not remember which kid sold him the book at which traffic signal! Will you do your work or not? Sir, tell you what. Let's staple the pages on. What? - Let's staple the missing pages! How many have you printed so far? We just started with the second lot, sir. - Dump it. - What? Start a new lot. But, sir.. It'll be a waste of time and money! - Do it. Now! - Okay, sir. - What's your name again? - Sir, Sawan. - Sawan what? - Sawan Murthy. Are you from the south? Not really, sir. I've been in Mumbai for a long time. But my family is from the south. Hello! When are we announcing the Mumbai team? Under 22? Nothing much. There's this kid here. Okay, listen, I'll call you back later. You're not the only one desperate for a place in the team. There are tons of players willing to pay money. Player's salaries have gone up these days. If you get into the 20-20 league.. ..then sky is the limit! You agree? To run any business, you must invest first. And you're your own business! Where else can you recover your investment so quickly? Listen, if you were a mind-blowing player I wouldn't have spoken about money at all. Don't get me wrong, you are a good player. But you see, you're no Sachin Tendulkar! Had you been half as good as him, there was no stopping you. Arrange the money by next week. Rs. 1 million. Okay? Come on, come on! Savvy? Want a ride to your practice session? No, you carry on. I'll go in the evening. Savvy, keep him in the shade, okay? Listen to your uncle. Bye. - Sister. - Yes? Sister, do we have some money saved? You need money? How much? Rs. 1 million. Nevermind, it's okay. Why do you need so much money, Savvy? Forget it, it's nothing. If you need a ride from the ground, call me. You remember the girl at the party? Spare me, dude. - No, really I'm telling you, man! Okay, hang on, let me show you.. - Look at this. - Let me see. What do you have to say now? This is amazing, man! What an item! - She let you film her? - As if she knew that! - Send it to my phone! - Sure. - Bluetooth it. - Sure. Just a second. Send it now. - Boy, this is fun! - Mandook! To the left.. The green bag. Saw it. - Let's get it in the next station. We will be there in two minutes. Listen.. Holy Lord! Where did you find this? Where the heck did you find it? I never thought I would hold an AK-47 someday! How do you know it's an AK-47? They show it all the time on TV. - Is it written anywhere? - Must be written somewhere. It's an AK-56, you moron. I'm telling you, this is an AK-47! How does it matter whether it's 47 or 56? - Where did you get it from? - How does that matter? We've hit the jackpot. We can make a lot of money! Have you lost it? There may be cops looking for this. What if it belongs to terrorists? No way. Don't try to scare us. We can loot a big place with this baby! Shopping mall, jewelry shop.. Bank! We could just sell them and make money. You know someone who might be interested? - Hey! I'm not letting anyone sell this! But we can sell the rest of the loot, right? - Fine. Let's talk to Mr. Tipu. - Yes, talk to him. And look at this. The highlight! Have you ever seen a bomb blast? Be careful, it may be on, you moron! No, its fuse is blown. Give it to me. Put it back. You guys have lost it. With this baby in your hand, you can do anything. Anything! Put it down, you fool! Turn it away, you idiot! There are no bullets in this. Look at this. - You're crazy! - None of them are loaded. - Put it aside. - There are no bullets. Look at this. No bullet in this as well. - Take a look. - Go die. - Tilak! Ramesh! Look here! - Don't irritate. Just take a look. There's no bullet in this. I don't get it. What is it that you are selling? What is it, sir? I didn't understand. Are you selling something? I know good English. We can converse in English. No, it's fine. That's okay. You have built a swanky office. Nice office. You've spent a lot. If someone breaks in, you would end up spending double, right? I'm asking for much less. I've to go somewhere. Are you asking me to leave? - I'm saying that.. - You can go if you want to. If you want me to go, say so clearly. Yeah. I guess, I'm asking if we are done here. So let me get to the point. Please do that. What kind of life would you like? Go to work, do your work, get back without any tension, right? To be tension free you need security. Which we can guarantee. You can even trust us with your office keys. So, you have someone to guard my office. Do I look like a guard to you? - But you will protect my office. - Yes. Do you work for some kind of security company? Me and my friends are your security. Seriously! Yes. That guy.. He sent you, right? I'm here to help you. And you're going on about who sent me and why and crap. Now that's enough. Please go. It's your choice. Think about it. I don't need to think about this crap. I don't need protection. Now, please go. Is this the way you talk to guests? Guest.. Okay, nevermind. You're busy. Sorry I wasted your time. One, two, three, four, five.. What the heck! I'd asked for three truck full of people. They've sent me 6 bikes! How will this work? Call the supplier. Quick! Turn the volume down! The noise in this city pierces your ears. If a man can't even hear himself how will he think properly? No surprise that people kill one another for petty issues. That Party Secretary's son partied all night long. He got into an argument this morning. Next thing you know, he got shot. Now we have to stage a protest. Hey! Did you call him? - So, all well? - Going on. - Sir, you.. - This one doesn't talk at all. - You haven't forgotten me, right? - Mr. Tipu! - Mr. Tipu. - Yes, just like your uncle! Your mom is like a sister to me. - How's the cricket going? - Pretty well. Hope to see you play for India soon with Sachin. Don't forget me after you become a star, okay? Oh come on. You are too much. Mr. Tipu, I wanted to ask you something. - Yes, go on. - Cricket selections are on. And I don't know anyone else but you. Can your Party Secretary put in a word for me? You should've told me two days ago. I'd have done something. Now's a bad time. We're in the middle of organizing some rioting. - Actually, Mr. Tipu.. - We are ready. Okay, move it, move it. Quick! Mandook.. Mandook. Want to come along? - Me? - Yes. - Really? - Of course. - Let's go! - Are you mad? - Be here. - Next time, Mr. Tipu. Sure! Okay? When are you coming to check the loot? I'll call you! Sawan, if you need anything, just send me a message. Hey! So you came! Sorry, it took so long. These shoots always go over. - But did you see me? - Yeah.. No.. - You were amazing! - Well, it's only a stupid ad. You know, 'look above and look down'. 'Stick it out, stick it in. Pout.' And all this to sell cement. Me? Selling cement? I need a cigarette. Do you have a smoke? No, I don't smoke. Neither do I. Mister, do you have a cigarette? So where are you taking me? "This heart is aware of everything." "It still makes excuses." "These eyes see everything." "Still don't understand the signs." "This heart gives many excuses." "These eyes don't understand the signs." "Gradually.. The eyes" "the heart has gradually started liking each other." "Gradually.. The one who was stranger" "appears close to heart." "Ambience is full of romance.." "For two hearts to meet." "Eyes appeal.." "For these moments to halt." "How do my lips whisper" "though locked, it reveals everything in my heart." "Gradually.. The eyes" "the heart has gradually started liking each other." "Gradually.. The one who was stranger" "appears close to heart." "My love.." "My love.." Come on. Watch out! Sir, dollar? I'll get you best exchange rate. No, thank you. Sir, I can get you anything you say. - Totally good, thank you. - Anything, sir. - No, we are good. - Anything. I mean, how did he know to speak English to me? - It's not like I look white. - That you don't. Dollar.. Sir, dollar.. You want some fresh coconut water? - No, you go ahead. - Take it, ma'am. It's very good. - No. - Take it. - No! I don't want it. Why? Ma'am, this is beautiful. - What are you doing here? - Hello, sir. What the heck! What are you doing here? - What's your business.. - What kind of man are you, sir? Buy her a pretty necklace. Don't be stingy! Look, I asked you a question and why are you talking to her? Don't be so rude, sir. I was just saying a 'hello' to her. - Hello, ma'am. - Hello! No need to shout. - What! The two of you are following me! I was just trying to help her out. - Do you know these guys? - No. Do you? Ma'am, whether you know us or not, we know you. The other day we saw you get home at 3 a.m. What were you.. What were you doing near her house? Calm down. He said, he was passing by, and said hello. Dare you try and turn this into a coincidence, okay? Never come near me again. Got it? Don't shout. We're going. Don't you ever come near me again and don't you ever go near her or speak to her again. Do you understand me? Get out of here. Keep your hands to yourself. If I see either one of you again, I'll have you arrested. Are you okay? Mandook, why isn't your Tipu here yet? - Will he come for sure? - Of course, he will. As soon as he comes, we'll take him to the press and show him the stuff. Let's have a drink till then. Hey, Mandook. Look over there! Your girl's boyfriend is here. What a fool he made out of you with his English. He even gave you a lovely name. 'Ass'! Stop it, man! That sun of a gun.. Hey you! Get another drink! We need a good customer for this deal. I hope, Tipu helps us get a good deal. Once that happens.. Have you kept the stuff safely? He has kept it on the first floor of the press. It's safe. Hey, Mandook. The stuff is safe, right? Yes. I'll go take a leak. Be there. Don't even think about getting up! You went on and on in English the other day, right? Now talk! - I was just.. - Yeah! You're 'just'. You moron, I'll adjust you right now! Speak in English now. Hey! Stop! Don't even think of cleaning up! - Come on, apologize in English. - Sorry. Say it in English, you fool. That's what I said. Sorry! Say it from the heart! Say 'Sorry, sir'. - Come on. - Sorry, sir. Say 'Sorry, sir. You are a superstar'. Arrange for two more. Just do it. Tipu's here. It's business time, I'll talk to you later. - Hello, Mr. Tipu. - How's everything? - He is Tilak. - Tipu. Tilak.. Mr. Tilak. - Where's Mandook? - Where's Mandook? You are great and I am waste. Give me your purse. - Give me your phone. - It's brand new. I spent my entire salary on it. Which idiot buys a phone with his entire salary? It's just to make calls! Out with it, give me the phone. It's brand new! Haven't even taken the plastic off. Really? Let me see. - It's nice! There it goes. - What the heck! Hey, Mandook, what are you doing up there? Get down! Have you lost it? No big deal, man. Was just scaring him for fun. You fool, what're you doing with the gun out in public? You moron, stop messing around now. You'll put us into trouble. Come now.. - Sir.. Sir, this man put a gun on my head. - You piece of crap. - What does that mean? He's my friend. I can abuse him. You can't. Come on, let's get out of here now. Come on, let's scoot from this place. - What's up? Let's just get out of here. Do you have the stuff or not? - What the heck! - Isn't it fabulous? That's some loot! Let me call the hero. I'd gone on the sets. That heroine was there too. What's her name? The one with the long neck. What's her name? The one with big.. Yes.. How are you? No, just got my hands on some goods. No, not a girl. The other kind of goods. Yes. There are a couple of revolvers. No, not German. Looks local. There's a bomb here. I don't know if it's RDX or not. Never seen RDX before. - Looks like it will blast. - It will blast, right? Sure it will. That too loudly. You are right, what use is it to you. Mandook, selling the bomb looks difficult. There's more top quality stuff.. 47, 56.. Hold on, please. Yes, mom, what is it? Oh, for heaven's sake, make any curry you want to. No, not that vegetable. It causes gastric trouble! Now hang up. Sorry, just a second. Is it 47 or 56? - 47. - 56. They don't know. What difference does a number make! It's an AK, isn't that enough? Just a moment. Everything is for sale, right? - Yes. - No. Yes or no? How can you have the heart to sell this? Please.. Yes. Oh, you want a photo? Sure. Happy shooting! What happened here? Hey, you are up! That looks pretty bad. Yeah, it's.. a long story. So, do you want to talk about it? Not today. Maybe when you are back. You know you can talk to me, right? Let's just say, there are some things about my past that I'm not proud of. I'm starting afresh. We will talk about it when you get back. - How long are you going for? - Just a few days. - Hey! - What? - Come back soon, okay? - Yeah? Yeah. Hello. I had called earlier. Some people.. They are threatening me. They are threatening me. They are.. They are harassing me. Okay, they are following.. They went to my girlfriend's house. Girlfriend? Did they enter the house? - Did they do anything to her? - No. They didn't do anything. It's all veiled. You know, veiled? Stealthily. They act like they want to do some business with me. Do you know who they are? Actually, I don't know who they are. See, it's festival time. These things happen. It's so sad how they harass decent men. Don't pay them heed and they won't harass you. Yes.. - They are loafers. They are better off dead! Okay? If something goes wrong come and see me tomorrow. Okay? By the way, tell me about your business. - Something big, right? - No.. It's a small business. If you want, we can do something. I can give you protection. Personally. We can work out something, if you want. Think about it. I've never seen a bomb blast! How much damage will it do? Will it destroy that hut? Easily! Damn, this is frigging awesome! Come on! Let's go blast it! Right now, right here! It's not going to sell anyway! Let's take Tilak along, find an empty place and blast it there. I don't care which place. It should cause some damage! Tilak, let's just blast it somewhere here. Do we really need to go out of the city? Are you crazy? Look at the crowd here. So what? We'll blast it quickly and run. - No one will get to know. - Listen to me. Let's go out of the city and blast it in peace. You guys are such a waste! What's a bomb if it doesn't cause any damage! I have an idea. Let's blast it in the sea. It'll make a spectacular fountain! - Treat to eyes. - Use your head. It will just fizzle in water. Shut it, both of you! We can't blast it here. Understood? You both aren't sport. You don't have guts. What? "Life just goes on." Hey, Ramesh! Look at that. She is showing off. What an item! "Your emotions plays with you" "every moment." "There's a trap everywhere" "there are hardships all over. The crowd of emotion" "follows you everywhere." "Life just goes on." "Why do you act stubborn?" What tragedy, man! There's no empty space in all of Mumbai! Where we can blast a bomb in peace, right? - Man, what has this city come to! - You are right. So what's new? Every week, they set you up with a new guy anyway. I'm saying the same thing. I'm just fed up of all this. So what can I do, Seju? You can't expect me to find a new solution for the same problem everytime! - What do I do? I don't know. I have enough problems of my own. Why do you always get so riled up about this? Why do you always bring it up then? Bring it up? I'm the one going through crap at home everyday! My family doesn't care whom I marry they just want me married immediately. Everyday they put a new joker in front of me! Look. I don't know about you but I am not marrying some random fool. Hey, I can't understand! This is insane! Who gets married so early these days, anyway? If your parents are forcing you tell them, you're not interested. Please! Now don't start crying and all. I'm going crazy as it is. I'm going home. Seju.. Sejal! - You know what to do, right? - Yes, of course. - Don't pull any stunts! - Got it! And throw it over there, nowhere else! - I know, man! - You know what to do, right? Why are you stressing out? I just have to press this, right? - This is not a TV, okay? - Be careful, you idiot! Nothing will happen, relax! I just have to press this! - It got activated. - Move.. Why is it not blasting? It will. Give it some time. It's not a grenade. You need to light it on the ground. You shouldn't fling it. Mandook, go take a look. Why don't you go? I think it's a dud, man! There's not even a sound. It doesn't even have a fuse that makes a sound for us to know it will blast or not. Nothing's happening. Go take a look. - What? - Just go. Get down. Hey! The bomb's switched off!. What the heck, man? Don't fool around with me! No! Hey! Tilak! Let's go! Speed up. Faster. Leave the bike. Hey! - That's a bomb. - Hey! - Catch him. - Hey! Stop, you kid. It's a bomb. That's a bomb. - Stop. - I said, stop. - Stop, that's a bomb. - Get hold of him. That's bomb in your hand. Drop it. Catch him. Run faster. Catch him. - What do I do with this? - Just throw it away. - What are you doing? - It's active. What are you doing? Throw it away. The kid.. The kid is there. - Hey, Tilak. Stop. - Tilak. - Let's go. - He's alive. - But the kid is.. - Stop, let's go from here. Tilak, let's go from here. Let's get the heck out of here. Come on. Yes, I had my dinner. How about you? Yes, I had dinner with sir. Noodles.. Yes, I had noodles! I've been waiting for technical support for a week. How can you not be aware? - Sir's not here. - Does nobody over there has any accountability to do that? Don't act smart and just leave. - I told you, he is not here. - Can you at least have your manager call me and give me - a reasonable explanation. - Why are you barging in? Thank you. - Is this some kind of hooliganism? Sir, they are not listening. I tried to stop them, they just barged in! - Hey what.. - Stop! What did you think when you came here? That you'll come here, start a business, make a lot of money? What about us? You think we don't deserve to make money? You can't part with half a million? This dog is worthless. He's not worth a penny! But you.. What's half a million rupees to you? If we come to know, you don't want to pay you won't be of any value either. It won't take me a second to hack you to pieces right now. Until this place starts stinking up no one will even know you're dead. One more thing. I didn't kill him. You killed him over half a million! And your girlfriend is next. You better pay up in two days. We'll tell you where to bring the money. 1 million rupees. And please. Don't go to that inspector. We will have to line his pockets too then. Of course, it will only go from your pocket. But it's just a lot of trouble for me, you know? Okay, sir? Bye! Come on! Hasn't your girlfriend called you yet from foreign? Hello darling, how are you? Miss you! Mr. Sawan Murthy, what can I do for you? Sir, I want to apply for a loan. To build a career, actually. Actually, I saw your ad about education loans. So I thought.. - Not possible. - But why? But you told me to bring Sawan and you'd do something. I know I did. But.. Education loans are for paying tuition fees. And cricket is hardly education or a career. Do you get my point? Moreover, you don't have a guarantor or a guarantee. Sir, there is a guarantor! Robin can give guarantee! Of course! I'll personally give you guarantee. - He'll pay you back for sure. - What will I do with him? This is not working! I'll have to figure out something else. Savvy, there's a message about Sejal. Check this auto rickshaw! This one. - No, wrong one. - Let's check ahead! The auto should be on this road somewhere! How about that one? Check in this one! Sejal! Sejal, stop. He is calling. Do you know him? - What are you doing? - Sejal, I need to talk to you! - But I don't want to talk to you! - Who the heck is he? Who is he? Do you know him? - Yes. - Stop the auto! What are you doing, Savvy? You'll get hurt! - What's going on here? - Stop! Stop the auto! Pull over. Cut across and stop it! Stop. What's your problem? Why are you making a scene here? Me? What do you think you are doing? What? I told you that if you didn't find a solution, this would happen! Come on, let's go talk somewhere else. - No! - Come on now. - I can't go with you now. - Then? - I don't know. Doesn't it matter to you anymore? Did it ever matter to you? I told you a thousand times what was going on at home! Were you even bothered? Look, Ashok is waiting for me. I have to go now. What Ashok! Why are you going around with him? Because mom said so. I don't have any choice and you don't care! Come on, sit down. That was so simple, right? For so little, you created such havoc! Sir.. One million was our first offer. You're late, so we increased the price. Look at this! It sparkles! Don't you worry about security anymore, sir! You go on a holiday with your girlfriend. We'll meet again in Diwali! Will you sit for a second, please? Will you sit for a second, please? You go to bed. I'll come later. The boy's name was.. Santi.. Santiago And an enormous sycam.. Sycam.. Sycamore had grown on his body. Are you in your senses? That's the worst plan I've ever heard! Listen to me, Mr. Tipu. It's the perfect plan! The heck it is perfect. If you get caught, you'll end up in jail. Listen to the whole plan first! Then you... What then? It's not like suspension in school. Hear me out, Mr. Tipu. Can you just listen to me once, please! Fine! Tell me your plan. We need four people. Two in the bank, one at the door and one near the bikes. - Bikes? - Two bikes. Better than cars in this horrible traffic! Bank opens at 10 a.m. There are only 3-4 staffers - including Mr. Nattu. - Now who is Nattu? - He's the watchman. - So what do we do about him? - That's the best part. - Once he opens the bank he doubles at the jewelry store across the street. It takes him at least half an hour to get back. So for half an hour.. There's no one guarding the bank! - What about security cameras? - We'll wear scarves. Everybody wears them because of this pollution. Sejal always wears it when she's out. Yeah, there's the swine flu scare too. - Oh yes! - What if the watchman comes back? - He won't. - What if he does? - He has one gun which was made before even he was born! Moreover, he's very old. What can he possibly do? And what about the customers? Let's do it on Lord Ganesha Immersion Day. Bank will be open, but there won't be many people. Even if people come, we'll have guns, knives and other stuffs. Yes, we'll just shoot the scoundrels down, right? I was only thinking of locking them up in the washroom. - So this is your grand plan! - Yes! Perfect, isn't it? And you want to do this because you want to bribe some greedy selector? What else? It's the only way I can get on the cricket team. My dear boy, it's not as easy as you think. Listen to me, focus on your game. If nothing works out, get a job! Why do you want to become like me.. I mean, them? Wants to rob a frigging bank! Everybody wants a shortcut. What will happen to this country? - Rambalak? - I have no idea. I heard he's gone back to his village with his wife. He doesn't know anything, sir. Someone killed him! And the police won't do anything! You be careful too! Once these people latch on to you they don't let go that easily! Hello, sir! How are you, sir? How's your girlfriend? Sir, I have another business proposal for you! A little more expensive. What say, sir? I'll come and meet you in a couple of days. That if it wasn't a child.. Do you need anything? - Some tea? - No, I have some work. - What are you reading? - What? What book are you reading? Oh, it's nothing. We print these at our press. I read this book when I was in school. - What? - You can read? Of course! I went to college. I read this book when I was in the 10th grade. It's so interesting, right? That kid looks for treasure all over but later he finds out.. You haven't reached that part yet, right? - No. - Sorry, sorry, sorry! But do finish it. You'll enjoy it. - You went to college? - Yes. I didn't know you are a graduate. You never asked! What can you do with one job in Mumbai? You need your hand in many pies only then can you see some money. You need to keep your options! Hold on, let me ask. How much is 4000 dollars in rupees? Tipu, enough already! Come here. I am busy right now. Call you later. Come, I said. Show them the stash. - What is this? - Goods. - What is this? - Goods. Tipu, are you here to buy or sell? Well, we did come to sell but.. Show them. Go ahead. Mandook, let's show them the big one! You'll get top price as it's a rare item. Are you crazy? How can you think about selling it? We have to show something. It's a matter of pride now. - Think about the money too. - Fine, whatever! Don't chew my brains! - What is this? - The real stuff!. - Where did you get it? - Why do you care? - Do you want it or not? - It's a risk, but take it. Sixty. - Sixty what? - Thousand. You miser. You think we are beggars or what? Hey shorty, you talk too much. Easy. They are amateurs. - So they get excited. - Put a leash on the short one. It barks too much. - Did I say anything wrong? - They have no business sense. Sorry, sorry! Shut up, Mandook! I am quiet. If not you, who else will they learn from? Yeah! Like it's my job to teach these idiots. They'll learn slowly! I apologize on their behalf. They think they are gangsters. I didn't expect this. Had no idea they were selling too! What a waste of time! Not really. I swiped some bullets! When the heck did you flick this? You idiot, if you get caught, they'll gut us! They can't do anything. They're morons, standing around with their zipper open! Let's try the bullets in these guns! - Save this idiot! - Come on. Savvy! I was calculating. So far only seven players have played well. That means eight slots are still open! So 7 less than 60 makes it 53 divided by eight is.. Chuck the calculations. Just play the next two matches well! At least one match. He is hurt. Call the coach. - What happened to your nose? - Won't you talk to me? Savvy, everybody's home. Mom keeps coming up here to check on me. Why are you acting like this? You still love me, don't you? Why don't you stand up to your mom? Quit going out with that cartoon! Has he left? What? What is this? - I got engaged to him yesterday. - What! Are you serious? What the heck! Why didn't you tell me? Savvy, it's paining. Savvy, it hurts, please. Anything on the team selections? Hello, sir! How are you? What do you want, sir? I have everything. - Powder, girls... - I need something else. Sure, come with me. Sir, you want girls? Indian, Russian, Ukranian.. You want what! No way. Too dangerous. I don't deal with that stuff. No, sir, I don't. You want coke I can get you top quality stuff. Do it right here if you want. You want a girl, let me know. That's all I can do. You know Fashion Street? Meet me there tonight. Our branch office at this traffic signal has very strong sales. Auto rickshaws are not allowed beyond this signal. Only taxis and cars. These are all well educated people from good families. I always have at least four kids working here! Hey, Salim! Come here. He's a nice kid. Go, get to work now. There's a new bestseller coming from Chintan Gandhi. And we'll be the first to sell that book! Right here at these traffic signals. We are going to make a lot of money from it. We'll be the only ones to sell that book first. Not even bookstores. We'll buy a big car within a year. Nano! Next year, we'll be stuck in traffic just like this but in an AC car! You are engaged, your wedding is fixed for next month! And you tell me, you don't feel like it! Do you think this is some kind of game? You never cared for your studies. You never helped out at home. You don't even have a degree. I've spent so much money on you. Have you gone to the gym even once? Look at you. Look how fat you are! Open the door right now! Sejal! Sejal! Open the door I said! You don't deserve this alliance. They are such nice people. They are still waiting for you. What do I tell them now? Will you come out or not? Why don't you tell me what your problem is? You're going to ruin our reputation. He'll be here any minute. Okay, I'll make a move now. Thank you, sir. Are you going to kill someone? Actually, don't tell me. You don't plan to kill yourself, do you? There, that's him! How far are we going? How far? You got the moolah? Yes. - Cash. - Yes. How much? The client is ready. Are the goods ready? Where? Okay. Wait. Relax. Here's the fare. Get in. What? Made in India or Pakistan? You do your work. Does it work? Local stuff looks cheap. But you get it going, it'll rip everything apart! No worry. We just tested it half an hour ago. - You plan on shooting someone? - No, it's just for security. Do whatever you wish to with it. Just don't get caught with the gun. Else the cops will catch us. Got it? Sir, this is falling short. No, it's all there. The amount is right. It's not. It's less. Here, count it. Fine, I'd like some bullets, please. We have bullets too. Here, take this. You want it? It will cost you more. - Good. We take dollars too! Come to me.. No, setting buses on fire is not my thing. My boys can stage a protest. Can't you take no for an answer? Now let me party in peace. - Okay? - To find you.. I saw inside your eyes.. I know it and I know it because I need you. - I saw.. - What's up, Mandook? - Got you a good deal, didn't I? - Superb deal. You still have the long one? Sure. But I don't want to sell it, it's my pet. We might need it for a job. - What? - What job? Solid plan, sure shot job. Lot of money. - How much? - We need one more man. Where's your friend Tilak? Since he got married, he dances to his wife's tunes. Do you have bullets for the long one? That's the problem. Can you set me up with some? - I was born for this. - Right. You call Tilak first. Enough! We are almost home. - I'll eat there. - It's okay. Just one more. Book? What book? Man, what a book! You should read it. You've been sitting at home reading a book!? - Is it in Hindi? - No, English. What philosophy! Western philosophy is something else! We barely know how to spell philosophy! So you won't help us because you're reading a book? Not like that, man. Listen, a man never does what he wants but he becomes what he does. - What? - Listen.. In life.. What nonsense! Have you totally lost it? Look, please don't do this to us! It's a lot of money and we need your help. Enough is enough! I can't do this stuff anymore. Now on, I will dedicate my life.. To heck with your life. Let's go, he has lost it! Wait, it really is a very good book. Hard to read at first. There are big words and all. But once you get going, you won't put it down! Now I know why people spend so much and read fat books! What philosophy! Does your book also teach you how to ruin your friends? You both take one copy each. I have lots of copies lying around. Come in, quick! Mandook, don't act over smart. We'll go according to our plan. We will be leaving this place with the money. - Sure. - Got me? - Here, take these. Here. I'm here only for moral support. - Moral what? - Non-violence. Guys, let's be quick. I need to go home for Lord Ganesha's idol immersion. - Crazy fellow! - Let's go. - Don't get up. - Hey, move! Catch him. - Baby.. - Don't you dare move! - I said, no one moves. - Don't get up from your seats. We've hijacked the bank! Come on, out! Come on! No stupidity. - Old man, we've hijacked the bank. You want me to give it in writing? Move. Hey you too. Get hold of him. - Come. - Come out. - Nobody moves. Everyone, into the washroom! Where's the washroom? Get the money, quick. Tell him! Give me your mobile phones. All of you, quick! You too. Hurry up. All of you move to the washroom. Go inside. Go inside the washroom. - This is gents washroom. - Madam, adjust for today. - Come on. - Lock. - Come on. - Lock it up. - What is this? - That's all we have here. Rs. 8,000 and change? - You think I'm an idiot? - Don't think we're not fools! Where's the money? Why do you want to die for someone else's money? - It's in the locker. - Open the locker then. The manager has the keys. - Who the heck are you then? - Assistant Manager. Call the manager. Today is Lord Ganesha idol Immersion. He will be late. - He'll be here in two minutes. - Two minutes in real? - Or the delayed two minutes? - 15 minutes. - You.. - We'll wait. Till the manager comes. If he doesn't reach in 15 minutes, you're dead! - It's a one-way street. - It's okay. You drive. Where are you going? It's a no-entry. Step out. Show me your license! - Drive. - You can go. I'm only doing this for friendship. I don't care about money these days. Right. Why don't you donate all your money then? I will do just that! I don't want this money! Then why don't we reduce your share to zero? Do whatever you want to. Crap! I have to go home and rethink about my life. - Two more minutes, please. - Two more minutes again? Mister, where are you going? The bank is closed! Why is it closed? It's open today! I tell you, it's a bank holiday! Go home! What bank holiday? Why? Uncle, it's Lord Ganesha's idol immersion day! It's a national holiday in Mumbai! - I know but I checked. The bank is open today! Hello, it's 10:30 a.m. Who is it, man? Some old man. He's not leaving! Why didn't Tipu stop him? Don't know what on earth he is doing outside! You know what, let's just wait here. He'll leave on his own! Don't you understand. You old man.. - You moron! Where are you going? He'll get us killed! Old man, can't you see the bank is closed? That's what I'm asking. Why is it closed today?! - Come on, head to the washroom. - Move it! Rascals! They took away my brand new phone! I shouldn't have come to the bank today! I deposit Rs. 1,000 every month here as SIP. - You think it's all gone? - Gone! Your money is gone! - Final two minutes, please! - That's it. Enough of your nonsense! You're dead. - He's here! - Open the door. - Move it! - Yeah, move it! Open it! Hurry up. There's a lot of money here. - Take it all out! - Hey! Move! Hurry up. Fill the bag up. - Quick! - Didn't we hit the jackpot? Don't stop. - Take out all the money you have. - You want me to shoot you? - Didn't anyone call the cops? No, they took away all our phones! How can we call? Really? They didn't take mine! Hello, mom? The police station number.. Yes, the police! No, mom, why would I call you if I knew the number? Don't move. Tilak! Look at this. Look how much money we have got here. Have you ever seen this much money! - Come on, let's go! - No one moves till we leave. Think about calling the cops and I'll shoot you. Want a demonstration? Here you go. What the heck! Have you lost it? What did you just do, you mad fellow? Tilak! Tilak.. We are doomed. - Come on, let's leave! - Oh my God, Tilak! Get some water for him. Tilak! You stop. - Tilak! - The police is here. - It's Tilak, man. - Police. Police! We will be in trouble. - Let's go. - Tilak. You.. Let's go. There. They're the robbers! Catch them. Move.. Move, I said. Catch them. Get hold of them. I'll call the ambulance. Put the money in the vault first. Take him to the hospital right away. Open the door! Is anybody out there? Please, sir. Don't shoot us, sir. We didn't do it on purpose. We have nothing. We had to do that to survive. Where is it? Where's my money? - You want your money back? - Where is it? Give me my money. That is my money. - Okay. - Give my money back. Calm down, sir. We'll bring it right away! We will get it. That's my watch. Give me my watch back. Now! Are you here to really kill us? If you do, you won't get away with it! Here you go, sir. It's all in there, sir. - Count it if you want. - Get over there. You won't be spared. If you can get away with it, then I can too. And nobody is going to care about you. You are dogs. Street dogs. That sun of a gun. I'm not going to spare him. Get the gun! Bring me the gun! - All hail.. - Lord Ganesha! - All hail.. - Lord Ganesha! What other business yields returns as quickly as cricket? More investment, more returns. "You are fire."
