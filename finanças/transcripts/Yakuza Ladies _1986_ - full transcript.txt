He fools around and gambles. If I complain, he beats me. I can't count the times I went for a knife while he slept. But now that we're separated, I worry about him, wondering if he's hungry or sick. Don't worry. They treat you real well in prison these days. But you still do without. My man loves his cigarettes, more than liquor. And you know what, too, right? Don't remind me. I miss it. I'll bet it's full of cobwebs down there. How pathetic. That's all old ladies can talk about. And what about you? Tamaki, it's been almost three years since your husband got sent away. How are you doing? I'm just fine. Really? Then why do you look so sexy? It's because I eat men every day. I eat their souls, that is. You're something else. No wonder you can keep 500 men in line. We couldn't do that. Tamaki Awazu rented this place for us tonight. Let's drink and sing and dance 'til we drop! Enjoy to your hearts' content. We're celebrating the third year of the Prison Wives Club. Release your stress and keep your chins up. Yes. Let's enjoy! Thank you! Since Tamaki is allowing it, the old man can't complain. Cheers! My kid doesn't want to go to school. They're mean to her because her dad's in prison. What should I do? Don't worry. Kids survive without having to go to school. Tamaki, the office is old and I want to rebuild. Can you put in a good word for a loan? All right. Give our office a call tomorrow afternoon. Thank you! I can't take it anymore. My folks say I can come home. Will you tell my husband I want to leave him? Why don't you do it yourself? But... He'll kill me. Then bear with it. You're not very sympathetic. If I were, I wouldn't be able to control the syndicate in the absence of my husband. The wife of the main group is here. The leader's wife is here. Hey! The leader's wife! Thank you for coming. You seem to be doing very well, Tamaki. Is this the Awazu Prison Wives Club? That's right. We get together every three months to relieve our stress. My husband wanted to come but I told him men weren't allowed. This is a little token from me. Thank you for your thoughtfulness. I know it's not easy for you all. But a man is useless without the support of his wife. Think positive and do your best. Yes.

I take entertainers there occasionally. But all I see are couples and honeymooners there. I'd like to take a private trip with a proper girl like you. What's your name? She'll cost you, Mr President. She's over 20 and still a virgin. I see. Then shall I do the responsible thing and marry her? You're single? Yeah. I'm a virgin, too. Thank you! Bellboy! - Yes. I'll leave it to you. - Yes. Are you leaving soon? I'll wait for you outside. Thank you. Thank you very much. Please come again. Thank you. Do I have to go? What a creep. Be careful, Mako. Presidents of show business production companies can be bad news. Yes. And here's your pay for the month. Thank you. He's no good. Here's some money for a cab. Thanks. Mako, he's really waiting. It's a Mercedes convertible. What're you going to do? Go out the back way. We'll handle the rest. Thank you. Good night. Good night. Good night. - Good night. I'm home! I'm home, Dad. Welcome home. Not again. They're not good for you. You see? You should check into a hospital for a thorough checkup. I just have asthma. I know my body the best anyway. Did you eat? No, I don't have appetite. Don't say that. I'll fix you some udon noodles. Damn! Not again! And I just bought that one. Ms. Ike, how about you? What? I've had five panties stolen in the last few days. I haven't had a problem. Hey, is something in the workshop? Someone's been looking over this way. How nasty. There's no one there. Really? What are you doing? Who's there? Who's there!? Dad! Dad! Who is on the second floor of the workshop? Masao? It's me. Tokuda's orders. I'm here at a dump of a workshop making sure they don't skip out of town. In this stinking heat, too. So I can't go out with the guys. There's a broad with big knockers here, though. The address... What? Leave if you want to! We won't skip town! Rotten punk. Just think of him as a guard dog! It's better because other loan collectors will keep away from us! Hello. Mr. Shinkawa... Your car will be in the way of our neighbors. I didn't realize. Back it up. Yes. I'm sorry. It's been seven years since mom died already. We couldn't do much for her funeral or the third year service. So I want to invite all the relatives and have a big service for her this time. But there are two things I want to take care of first. The first is dad's health. He has high blood pressure besides his asthma. I can't allow him to do work like this forever. And the second is about you. I have a wonderful match for you. He's the heir to a large real estate company. He's a Tokyo University graduate. Quite an elite. What a minute, sis. You left this house saying you'd never come back. So why do all this for us now? - It's because... ...I can do anything I want for you and dad now. We don't need your help. Dad and I are doing just fine. And we can handle mom's seventh year service on our own. Do you know how much dad owes? I'll let you know when the marriage meeting will be. Quit that bar you work at today. I'll give you all the spending money you want. Keep going like this and you and dad will end up having to commit suicide. Dad, what don't you stop working like this already. Everyone's so excited about the economy and the strong yen. But little shops like this always end up taking the hit. Come on! Don't work so hard, all right? This hoodlum is a loan collector. What do you think this shop is? This isn't some ordinary factory. Shall we hurt him a bit? Do you know who I am? Yes. Let him go. What? The leader of the main group has collapsed! What did you say? Hello. It's me. Okay, I'll be right there. Notify my husband in Takamatsu right away. We'll get there faster by car at this hour. And put together about 100 million yen. Consult with Mr. Tokutsu about what to use as collateral. Understood? Tamaki, I'm so glad you came. Come over here. It was so sudden. Will you look at his face? My husband always liked you. He was taking his usual walk along the Kamo River when he suddenly collapsed. He didn't suffer and he died at his favorite spot. It was a fitting way for him to die. As the head of the Domoto group, the largest yakuza organization in Japan... ...he extended his influence from his base in the Kansai area... ...as the Don of organized crime. The Domoto group is reeling from the shock of losing its leader. Much attention will be given to... ...how conflicts between radical and conservative factions within the group will develop. The most likely person to take over the Domoto group is... Get out! ...Junior chief Masahiro Kurakawa, who has been Domoto's right hand since the group was formed. Other candidates include assistant junior chief Akimasa Koiso... ...who is considered the brains of the group... ...radical faction member Tatsuo Kakinuma... ...and Hitoshi Awazu, presently in Takamastu Prison for murder. Pushy kid. As per instructions given by our late leader, Ryuzo Domoto... ...the group will be succeeded by Tatsuo Kakinuma. Accordingly, the funeral services to be held on August 16th... ...will be lead by Tatsuo Kakinuma. Did he leave a will? That's why the new leader has been chosen! Idiot! Our advisory lawyer, Mr. Yumoto, had it. This is it. Mr. Kurakawa, what's your reaction? And you, Mr Kakinuma? I didn't expect this at all. I just feel the weight of the responsibility. My husband was very concerned about the turmoil his passing may cause. I believe he left the Domoto group in the hands of Kakinuma... ...because he wanted youth to lead the way. I just thought of a poem. "The Bon season passes. It is summer and the sun shade is lowered." "The Bon season passes. It is summer and the sun shade is lowered." The Domoto group has sought to perpetuate the spirit of chivalry... ...and service to society since its inception. In order to continue to do this... ...we find it necessary to secede from the newly reorganized Domoto group. We've decided to create the Horyu group... ...which will be led by Masahiro Kurakawa, longtime friend of the late Domoto leader. I want to make this clear. I do not intend this as a challenge to the main group. However, as chivalrous men, we pledge our lives to our leader. If we cannot accept that leader, we have no choice but to part ways. That's all. That Awazu is a real lucky dog. While he's taking it easy in prison, his wife has doubled his group's strength. She was the number one girl in the Kitano pleasure district. Right. We sure spent a lot of time and money there. Then that rotten punk, Awazu, stole her right from under our noses. Here she comes. It's been a long time. You're reluctant to see me, so I came all the way to Takamatsu. Wait a minute. At least listen to what I have to say. What did Awazu have to say about what's happened? I think he would understand how we feel. I try not to bother him with things about the outside. Besides, I came today to discuss my younger sister's marriage prospect with him. You sure bluff well. Doesn't it bother you? Awazu took a fall for the Domoto group and went to prison. His character and service record are by no means inferior to Kakinuma's. Besides, Kakinuma is still young. As leader, he won't let the power go for at least ten years. I think that's good for the main group. Is that how you really feel? Aren't you the angriest of all in your gut? Mr. Koiso. Won't you help us, Tamaki? Awazu is planned to be released on parole in three months, right? How about it? In celebration of his parole, we'll leave the Horyu leader's seat open. Right now, the Domoto and Horyu groups are about even. If you come over to our side, the undecided will come over too. Kakinuma will give in. Tell me if you have any other conditions. I'll do whatever you say. Then go to the next world and get our late leader's permission. What? If you get his permission, I'll go wherever you want me to. Now, if you'll excuse me. Sir! Your sister and I have worked together on real estate deals for a long time. I truly admire her as a wife and as a person. But my sister is still an innocent girl. Please be good to her. Yes. What a sweet girl. She's pretty and she looks smart, too. She's an ideal choice to marry into the Totsuku family. We'll be leaving now. And we'll be waiting to hear from you next time. Dad told me that you broke up with a high school teacher you'd been seeing because of me. High school teachers don't make any money. It was good that he left you. Poverty can only make a woman unhappy. This is a pre-wedding present from me. Well? Doesn't it make your whole body tingle? That's how women are. Bring me Kakinuma's balls. What? I said I want you to bring me Kakinuma's balls. Are you hard of hearing? No... Daddy! We're home. Welcome home! Did you have fun at school? Yeah! - Good! Welcome. Thank you for having me. Anything happen on the way? Nothing at all. Please get rid off all these bodyguards, sweetheart. It looks so terrible at school. What are you saying? We can't let anything happen. Takeya! Takeya! Let's play video games later. Yeah! He's grown so much. Get rid of Kakinuma. Got it? Are you serious? Of course I am. The leader and I made this decision when we created the Horyu group. This is the only way we'll win this war. But... why me? Two reasons. The first is that you have guts. The second is... that the Kansai groups don't know your face. But don't do it yourself. Hire an assassin and have him do it. If you get caught, I'll be targeted. Find a hitman that isn't from the Kansai area. Someone that's armpits deep in debt and desperate. But it has to be someone that's got nerves of steel. A foreigner might be good. Maybe mafia. Listen, Sugita... If we succeed, I'll become one of the chiefs of the Horyu group. And I could make you my successor. I like this one. This one's for me. Don't you think something new would be better? This is very good. Two guys were knocked off with this gun in New York and LA. Oh, it's great. Very nice. Sorry! Thank you! Good afternoon. On vacation? Spending some time with the family, Mr. President? No, this isn't my kid. He belongs to one of my superiors. This is Mako, the girl I told you about. It's a coincidence we met here. - Lucky guy. This is my superior, Mr. Kawase. And his wife. How do you do? What was your name? Mie! - Right! Mie! Hello, Mie. And this is... I don't know your real name. It's Makoto Ike. The 'ma' character means truth. 'Koto' if for the Japanese harp. How do you do? Makoto Ike... What a beautiful name. Where in Osaka are you from? Ikuno. We live in Tokoname in Aichi prefecture. You know, it's known for... Never mind that useless dribble. - Why not? I'd like to become friends. I'd never been to the Nagoya area. Then please come for a visit. Tokoname has the best aquarium in East Asia. I'll take you there. Impressive. My older sister gave it to me. I have something I'd really like to show you. That's my cottage. Won't you stop by for a bit? Thanks for coming right away. Shall we toast the fate that brought us together? Excuse me... What was it that you want to show me? I wanted to show you these three dragons. The first is justice. The second is courage. The third is compassion and he's carrying a ball. I've staked my life on these three dragons. Please get out of my way! I'll do what I have to. You will, huh? You have to pull the trigger or it won't shoot. An engagement ring? That's not worth a thing! Give it up! Welcome. Thank you for coming to such a shabby place. What a mess. They used a machine gun. We were all eating at the time. But they were lousy shots so most of the bullets went high. Looks like Koiso's doing. Yes. Our boys got into a fistfight with his at the speedboat races. Two of them are in serious condition. We just lost some glass and about five bowls of ramen. It may look bad but we really didn't lose much. This is from Ms Tamaki. Just a token. Thank you for always helping us. Keep working hard. This is an important time. Leave it to me. I'd be a sorry wife if I spurned the group while my husband is away. I'll follow you no matter what happens. I'm home, Dad! I'm home. Welcome home. Did something happen? They caught that underwear thief yesterday. It was a student that lives in the neighborhood. Did you have fun in Guam? Not bad. Tamaki kept calling for you. Your marriage meeting went so well, the boy's family wants to move things along. Dad... This is for you. It may be a little bright though. Why don't you give it to him? Him? The hoodlum in the workshop. Is he still here? He's the one who caught the thief. He twisted his ankle when he jumped from the second story. He's in bed. He's not a bad kid. We eat meals together occasionally. I don't believe you. So I can give this to him? It's me. Can I come in? Don't get up. Does it hurt? I heard all about it. You did good. This is a present from Guam, although I bought it for dad. How long do you intend on staying here? This place is going to disappear soon. Want to go to a disco? I have coupons to get in free. What are you talking about? I'll bring your meal here for you. But only for today. Mr. Yazaki is here. Show him in. Yes. It's them. They work at the Honeymoon Ginza. They brought in some heroin from Hong Kong and were running a petty little racket. What should we do with them? Throw them into the river? They could have something behind it. Might be better to give them to the cops. I'll do that. Wait a minute. You'd better give up your little finger. The Honeymoon Ginza is right in our backyard. Isn't that in your territory? I understand. Who's next? Hayasaki's wife. - Show her in. What's wrong? Take a look. What happened to your hair? I shaved it off. By yourself? Every time my rotten old man gets into debt from gambling, he makes me work as a prostitute. I though if I shaved my head, I wouldn't be appealing anymore. But he says nuns sell, too. I have two children and I don't want to do this anymore. Please help me! Get Hayasaki. - Yes. Do you want a divorce? No, I don't. Then what do you want me to do? Convince him to stop gambling and get an honest job. Then why did you marry a yakuza? It's too late for that now. I didn't marry a yakuza. The man I fell in love with just happened to be one. All the night games are cancelled. Can't be helped. - Tomorrow? About 3 o'clock. The pitcher? Kitabettsu, don't you think? Thank you. What a looker! Take a look! She sure is. But she's not in the business. Maybe she's Shinkai's mistress. Idiots! That's Ms Tamaki's younger sister. Of course she's pretty. Chief! Her younger sister's here? Welcome. Show her the way. Ms Tamaki, your sister's here. Show her in. Yes. I'm almost done. Fix yourself something to drink and wait a moment. You've never been here, have you. Surprised? I'm surrounded by men. This is the only female sanctuary I have. How was your pre-wedding trip to Guam? About that, sis... I came to turn the offer down. I'm just not cut out for a normal marriage. I know you sent me to Guam and everything but I'm returning this. The exchange of betrothal gifts will take place on the 12th of next month. It's suppose to be a lucky date. Mr. Tokutsu has agreed to buy the workshop and house for twice what they're worth. There'll be quite a bit left over even after the bank has been paid off. Thank you. I'll worry about dad from now on. The Tokutsus have even started to look for a house for you two to live in. They can't do that. No, you can't do this. A woman of 24 is a full-fledged adult. I've decided never to marry. Please understand, sis. I understand perfectly. You met a man in Guam, didn't you? Forget about him. If he makes trouble, I'll take care of him. Who is he? What are you going to do? Kill him? He's not an ordinary man, is he? Don't tell me he's a yakuza. Now that you mention it, he does have a tattoo his back like yours. Only he has three dragons. Now do you know why I'm turning down the offer? I'm going home. Wait! If you're doing this to spite me, that's enough! Yes? Check all the passenger lists of the flights from Itami to Guam this past holiday. Yes. Understood. Sis! You don't understand what yakuza are at all. We'll talk again after you get over this Guam business. I'll keep this until then. What is it? The successor got hit. What? They ambushed him in front of his Tenmacho house. Is he dead? We don't know yet. They took him to Abeno Hospital. Get the car! Well? We don't know. Sir? This is an outright challenge from the Horyu group. This is all out war! I hope you're prepared! No comment! Please tell us something? I said, no comment! Get out of my way. What's going to happen to the Domoto group now? Leader Tasuo Kakinuma is the victim of what is seen as an attack by the rival Horyu group. He was admitted to the hospital in critical condition, being shot through the head. This afternoon, in the midst of police search... ...a man turned himself in to the police station near the site of the attack. The man is Hajime Kawase, 45, head of an organized crime group... ...in Tokoname in the Aichi prefecture. By his own admission of the details of the event... ...it's been determined that he committed last night's attack. He was immediately arrested. Kawase was not affiliated with either the Domoto or Horyu group. The motive for the attack is currently under investigation. Where's Mokoto? She's watching the dolphin show with Mie. She showed up at our house unexpectedly and surprised me. She came because of Kawase. She said she saw it on TV. If I'd know what you two were planning, I wouldn't have invited her to Tokoname. Everything will be ruined if she says anything about you or Mr. Koiso in Osaka. My husband won't have anything to come back to in ten years! I know that! Leave everything to me. Are you going to be in Osaka for a while? Yeah. What about her daughter? I'm leaving her with my sister. I don't mean to sound cold but don't let emotions get the better of you. Understand? Yeah. That's great. Right? It's been a while. Want to come to my office to talk a bit? Looks good, doesn't it? My boss, Akimasa Koiso, wrote it for me. I consider him my father. Which means he'll become your father, too. - Mr. Sugita... When did I agree to marry you? Don't get so hot. Let go of me. I'll call the police if you touch me again. The police!? - What are you doing? You don't understand the situation you're in, do you? Just don't say anything and marry me. If you refuse, I'll kill you. This isn't a toy. I'll tell you an interesting story. A secret. Just between you and me. I intended to abduct you and take off as soon as I finished this job. That girl is the younger sister of Tamaki Awazu. Some goons have been looking for her. You'll be killed if you're not careful. So Tamaki Awazu is your older sister. You and I seem to have some kind of strange connection. Listen carefully. I'm serious about you. Kawase has a kid and yet he was able to sacrifice himself because he had the support of his wife. If you come with me... ...I vow to become the Capone of Japan. Congratulations! Thanks! We would like to formally introduce ourselves. I am the junior chief, Ichiki. Now, you guys. I'm the head of the action group, Ryuji Kikuna. I was washed here by the sea waters of Chiba. My name is Tappei Tokioka. I admired the yakuza so I joined the Sugita group. My name is Kyoichi Konno. My name is Tsutomu. I do what I have to. My name is Taichi Hanada. Shall we cut the cake? Sorry, we don't have a proper knife. What is this!? Settle down! Sorry to interrupt. Sugita, we need you to come to the station as a witness. Did you come here empty-handed and expect me to go with you? What am I supposed to be a witness to? If you want a warrant, we can have one made. Name your vice. What's this? Having this is illegal, too. You're the one that put Kawase up to knocking off Kakinuma, aren't you? Didn't Kawase say it was a personal grudge? I had nothing to do with it. Where were you the name of August 13th? Never mind. Kawase's being called the ultimate yakuza. Why don't you come to the station and make it easy on yourself, too? We appreciate this. Times have been hard lately. We can always depend on the Awazu group. The fight's about even right now. All we need is one more push. Seventeen young men have lost their lives since the group split. They went after you too, didn't they? I've always been lucky. That's because you do good deeds. One shouldn't forget how to offer prayers to the gods. Particularly when you live this kind of life. You've heard, haven't you, Tamaki? The Kanto group wants to make a deal. Yes. I'm considering accepting it. I'm sure my late husband doesn't want any more lives to be lost. Even if we make a deal, we need another leader. I'm thinking about making Noda the third successor. What do you think? I think Noda is capable. But what's going to happen to the Domoto group if we let the Kanto group in the deal? Even if we settle the deal... - I don't need you to tell me that! I won't let anything damage the Domoto image while I'm still capable. Please! Please wait three months. Awazu will be back this fall. Awazu will be able to settle this without anyone's help. I'm begging you! Do you plan to sacrifice men just for your husband? Don't get uppity just because you provided a little cash. Today's Prison Wives Club gathering sure is down. It's like a wake. It can't be helped. There are five people here who recently became widows. If my husband had been in jail too, he wouldn't have died... Everyone's headed to Kanto because they're afraid of Osaka yakuza. I heard some are getting caught by the cops on purpose. Times like this, it's safer for your man to be in prison. "Is the future of a man of Japanese spirit to wear a red kimono or a white one?" The late leader used to say this. Being a yakuza is like being exhaust. You need gas to make a car run. If you use gas, you create exhaust. And even though you dislike the exhaust, you can't do without cars. That's what he said the read world was all about. Does that mean we married car exhaust? We're going to stay and have fun a little longer. Please be careful on your way home. You all have children. Make sure you get home by morning. Yes. Good night! The story about car exhaust was interesting. - We've learned from that. Sis...! Sis! Wait! Don't go after them. Let's go before the cops get here. - Yes. What's wrong? - Be quiet! I hear something. The cat next door is in heat. Cat? You've been acting strangely lately. Are you feeling ill? That Awazu witch has put a 50 million yen bounty on my head! 50 million yen! She's making me her target! That's why I told you to hurry and retire so you can take it easy. I can't do that! Maybe I'll take Takuya and go home to my parents. What? Idiot! What are you doing? Can't you understand what I'm going though? Takuya. Takuya, wake up! What? Takuya! - What are you going to do? I'm going home! I don't make a good wife for a boss anyway! Takuya! Don't be stupid! What a huge earthquake! Osaka must have been destroyed! Boss! Boss, it's not a earthquake! Take a look! What's this? - It's the Awazu group! I can't believe this! I hate this! I hate this! Calm down! Stop it! Stop it! We'll be fine! Get a hold of yourself! Hello! Hello. Is it true that Ichiki got it? Yes it is. He was attacked while in bed and suffered injuries that would take three months to heal. Calls to threat and pester have increased lately. The main group in Osaka has been acting strangely too. The media has rumored that our leader is the one that was behind knocking off the Domoto leader. Isn't that why Mr. Koiso is trying to be away from our boss? I'm going to Osaka tomorrow. Osaka? I have to see Old Man Koiso to settle something. I'll go with you. - No. Listen... All the yakuza in Kansai are after me right now. I don't want to involve you too. Dear... Be strong. You're the wife of the Sugita group's leader now. Don't worry. I have no intention of being separated from you for ten years. I won't get caught. I'll go and introduce myself to your father on the way home. He'll probably cry. Just watch me. I won't let you or your father regret anything. The truth is, Makoto... I'm... ...scared. I'm scared. Kioso's wife is here. What should we do? Let her in. Leave us for a bit. Yes. Sorry. Hello Takeya. Are you on the way home from school? Today is Sunday, Auntie. So it is. What a stupid mistake. I'm sorry. I had a miscarriage the first year we were married. If that child had been born, my life may have been very different. Let's here what you have to say. It all depends on what she has to say. Right? Why should I have to bow my head to her? There she is! Sis! Sis! Here we are! Hey! Whose side are you on, anyway? Sis! Talk things over carefully, dear. If things continue like this, I'm really going to take Takeya and leave you. Good afternoon! Sis, I brought him just like I promised. Well done. It's been a long time. Let's both forget what's happened in the past and have a good talk today. I can do that. All of you wait here. Get off the boat. Hurry! - Yes. I'll be waiting for you up ahead at the bridge. That's enough formal talk. We're old friends from the Kitano days, aren't we? Don't just do it halfway. Fondle all you want. I just want to let you know, Mr. Koiso, that I'm serious about what I said today. So you really want me to disband my group as a condition for getting help from Kanto. If not, it'll become an endless exchange of bullets. How old are you now, Mr. Koiso? Me? I'm 56. Still in the prime of my life. You're right. Depending on how you play things, you'll last another 20 years. Compared to you, I'm just a bargain basement woman. You'll come out with the short end of the deal, if you lose. You've grown quite a bit since I last saw you. I'll bet you already know who the next successor will be. But this war is a battle of male pride. I don't think my retirement will settle things that easily. But I'll think about it. It's done. Will someone get the rice? Yes! It smells great. - Right? Ever since you've come, all the boys want to eat here. Welcome home. - My mom sent up some rice. Please have this. That much? My mom is a farmer in Mikawa. What should I send to thank her? - Think nothing of it. Thank you. Save some for me. Another delivery? Be careful. Don't worry. Delivery here. Please sign. Roger. It's okay. How long do we have to do this for, dear? The war is over, isn't it? Not yet. We're working hard to end it. This is the strangest way to go for a swim. That's why I told you to forget about it this year. But Takeya kept insisting. I guess I'll go swimming too. Come on, Takeya. Takeya, be careful! Takeya, I'll pull you off now. Hurry! Having fun? Aren't you out on bail right now? What are you doing here? Get down on the floor! Hurry! What are you doing? Is it true that our group may be disbanded? Disbanded? Who told you that? It's all over the papers. That hasn't been decided yet. So it's true. It's to put an end to the fighting. Someone has to be sacrificed. This is for the good of society, too! That makes me a fugitive! And the boys that have died... They died for nothing! What about me? Kawase will get out of prison and have nowhere to go! I'm going to take care of all you boys. How!? Tell me the truth! You... Is that any way to talk to your boss? If you disband the group, I'll spill my guts to the cops. That I'm the one that actually killed Kakinuma. Don't lie! My wife has the piece I used to do the job. Wife? You're still single. I found a wife. She's Tamaki Awazu's younger sister. What did you say? Have you lost your mind? I'm halfway there. Use this and write in blood that you're leaving the group to me. I can't do that. Do it! You... Do you intend to kill your boss? Do you? Please! Then please kill me! Otherwise I won't be able to face Kawase and the men that died. Please kill me! Don't be stupid. You just said you are my boss. If you're a yakuza, then for once in your life act like my boss! If you want to die so badly, do it yourself! If you show me you have guts like that, I'll reconsider. All right? Kill yourself. Die! Boss! Watch carefully! I'll kill myself! This is stupid! Boss! Dear, what happened to you? Your father died so suddenly. It caused quite a ruckus. We were all worried that you had left home when we didn't see you at the funeral. I'm very sorry. For Sale Why did you notify me? You must have known I was at Sugita's. Daddy, be happy. Looks like Awazu will become the next Domoto leader. The head of the Domoto group is the most powerful in Japan. I know I didn't do you proud while you were alive... ...but now you can boast in the next world. I'm going to live at a hotel in Kyoto from tonight on. So you can do as you please here. Banji... - Yes. Surprised? He was a big help when dad died. So I decided to take him in. Please show me your consideration. Have him do whatever you want. And you can wear anything in here. What's wrong? This isn't like you. Dad was worried about you until the moment he died. I couldn't even be with him when he died. It's all my fault. What's that? Sleeping pills. I want to go to sleep. Dad... Makoto is finally home. I'll never let her walk down the wrong path. Don't worry. A strange car is following us. Speed up. Who are you? I'm Kiyoshi Sugita from Handa. I'm the head of the Sugita group. I'm here to ask permission to talk to Mrs. Awazu. Please relay the request to her. It's Sugita from Handa. Mrs. Awazu, right? How do you do? I'm Kiyoshi Sugita. I'd like you to return your sister to me. Makoto is my wife. I made her suffer because of a mistake I made. But I'll never mess up like that again. You can talk about agreements and peace at the top... ...but our war has just begun. I promise to become as good a man as Mr. Awazu. Please. I'm begging you. Is that all you have to say? Listen up, Sugita. The reason I heard you out tonight is because of the moral code of the Kansai Yakuza. If you show your face in front of me again, it'll be the end of you. All right? Remember that. Attack on Group Leader Which pro baseball team do you like? The Hiroshima Carp. How about you, Ms. Makoto? The Tigers. Just as I thought. Why? All the women in Osaka are the Tigers' fans. Want to go to a disco? Ms. Tamaki will scold me. Idiot! There aren't any discos open this early in the morning. You must really be afraid of my sister. Welcome back. Is Makoto upstairs? Yes. Everybody, gather in the office. I need to talk to you. Yes. Get me some beer. - Yes. My husband's going to be released a month early. He's going to be transferred to Osaka on the 20th of next month and a week later he'll be released. He likes white. You once said you wanted to study fashion design in Paris. Why don't you do that? Why this, out of the blue, sis? I was just thinking of you. Does this have something to do with Sugita? Don't be silly. I know Sugita is alive. And that he's somewhere near here, too. You meet with Sugita, didn't you? Sis! Leave us. Listen, Makoto, yakuza can range from scum to the elite. That man is the lowest of the scum. He's an insect not even worth killing. But I will have to kill him some day. For your sake. If you insist on marrying a yakuza, find someone that can become the most powerful man in Japan. Then I won't have any complaints. Dad... I have to go to him. I'm sorry. He's a yakuza but he's in trouble now. As his wife, I can't leave him now. Please understand. Makoto... I'm serious. You're right. He is the lowest of the scum. But he's hurt desperate and suffering. That's why I'm going to him. Fool! Goodbye. Stop! You're not going to become a yakuza woman, too. I can't stand in front of Dad and let you go to hell. I'll do whatever it takes to keep you from leaving this room. Move! He used this to kill Kakinuma! I'll shoot! Idiot! Shoot me if you can. Why can't you just listen to me? I've made up my mind! I won't let you go! I'm going to him! I won't let you! I'm going! No! You idiot! You idiot! Why can't you understand? How could you fall in love with a man like that? Open your eyes! Why don't you understand? You've shown me how determined you are. I lose. You must really be in love with him. But as of today, we are not sisters anymore... We're not even related. We're going to be separate yakuza wives. Understand? The next time we meet... ...you'll have to be able to present yourselves with pride as man and wife. If not, you lose... You lose! Sis... Now, hurry and go. Hurry. Ms. Makoto... What's with that look? Did something happen? Are you still mad? Of course I am. Doing a crazy thing like that. That was just at act. I didn't hit anything vital. Really? Did you go to a doctor? If I did, I would have been caught. I didn't want to get caught until I saw you again. No... No... Never mind. No... Let's go to a doctor. Do you want to die? If I get caught... ...I'll get sent away for 10 years. Then I'll wait for you. I'll make the Sugita group 10 or 20 times more powerful and welcome you home. You sound like you-know-who. Don't say that. I'm not going to lose to her. Makoto... Do you still have the piece? Did you shoot someone? Tamaki Awazu. Don't worry. I didn't hit anything vital. Honey, don't you think you should get rid of this? You're right. This has only brought me bad luck. Boss!
