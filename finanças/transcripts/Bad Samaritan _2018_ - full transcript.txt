Hah! Hah! Hah! - Hah! - What are you doing? Stop! Stop! No! Hah! What are you doing? Hah! You're killing him! You're killing him! Excuse me, sir. I'd like to talk to you about the Lord. Yeah, that's, that's not really my thing. All right. Well, how about I jump your bones? What? - What? - Just... Don't move. Okay? Don't... move a muscle. No, no, no, no, no, no. - I look, I look like shit. - No, you don't. You look like an angel. And it's not about you. It's about that light... coming in behind you. Ah! No, don't! - What? - No, you weren't supposed to take that. Whoa, why not? 'Cause I, I, I'm serious. I don't want a... photo like that floating around. I... My father would kill me. It's so beautiful. Look at that. You're... You're beautiful. All right. This is just for you. This isn't for your book, or your dumb friends. Are we clear? Darling, I swear... on the eyes of our someday children. Oh, my God! Sean? I love this one. How did you get a smile out of him? Oh, yeah. It was a... was a tin of baked beans and a dirty limerick. God, it's crazy to think what you could do if you did this for your full-time job. Yeah, well, nothing would kill my creativity quicker than death claws of corporate America. You're talking to a business major. Yeah, but you're so much more than that. I mean, I'm just an artist. Just a poor,... struggling,... - Starving... - Starving. Adorable. - Really? - Mmm-hmm. My business major girlfriend. You have to support me, please. I love you. Straight up, legs balanced. You guide it down. Right? You try one. Okay. Here we go. Get grip, get a good grip on it. Don't step back. You don't wanna kill your dad. Okay, straight down. There you go. Took me a while, too, Rowan. - Happy birthday, Mother. - Oh! - How's it going? - Mmm. Ta-da! Lovely box. My goodness! Yeah, well, open it. Oh, Sean, darling. Is that emerald or what? You are my mom and all, so I thought I'd make an effort. Pricey gift there. Yeah, yeah, it's a Claddagh ring. It's, it's an Irish thing. You wouldn't understand. Sweetheart, I can't imagine what this costs. Oh, no, no, no. I got a good deal through a... lady at work. It was pretty reasonable. You wouldn't have to worry about money if you took the job in St. Louis. My cousin's offer is still good, you know? Well, as appealing as it sounds to take over lit shots of chicken wings and tacos,... I think I'm gonna pass. It's working as a professional photographer. - People would kill for that opportunity. - Well, it's not for me. Maybe you're just afraid to fail. Well, maybe I just don't wanna put on a suit and piss in a cup every day of my life. Would pissing in a cup be a problem for you? Oh, screw him. Stepdad, man. He drags us halfway around the world for a construction job... that goes belly up after two weeks. Dawg, that was seven years ago. Yeah, when I'm done whinging about it, Derek, I'll let you know. All right? Now, where is last night's? I got it right here. All right, man. - So, we got a lady's watch. - Yeah. - A Timex, man? - Yeah. They're good quality, man. A digital camera, man? Yo, people still use these? Absolutely. Really? Really? You stole stamps. Who the fuck steals stamps? Well, what was I supposed to do, Derek? Take the flat screen? You know? The point is, they don't notice. Also... I got a picture here. Gift card. No need to boost it when you got pocket scan. Okay, okay. See, that's why you the brains. Yeah, well, it's true. It's not our best haul by any stretch. Know what I mean? Hey, well, let me get the digital camera. You get the watch and gift card. Why do you want the camera? Oh, man, it may have boobies on it. Oh, dude. She was like Betty White's old. You know what I mean? That's disgusting. Mmm. She was old, but she's still got titties. You're a pervert. Looks all right, doesn't it? - Hmm? - Hey, yo? So she was really laying back with her shirt all open... looking all pouty face like a Victoria's Secret model? Oh, just never, never make that face again. Look, man, Riley's way too hot for you, dawg. And too smart. So you keep telling me, Derek. I'm sorry, man. Look, I'm just saying,... you gotta keep stepping up. See how much that tortured artist thing plays out for you when you're 30 and you're broke. Boys! Boys! - Nino! - Nino! I think three is too much. - Oh. - Two was better. I don't wanna piss off the regulars. People love the convenience, Nino. You're a trendsetter. Listen, soon all of downtown's gonna be following your lead. Come on, man. Don't worry about it. Okay, we see how it goes. We got you covered, Nino. Always the salesman, this one. Oh, shit. Hey, Nino, I got you, buddy. Bingo. Welcome to Nino's. How you doing, sir? I'll grab that for you. I told you, not in the restaurant. Put that thing away. You guys have a lovely evening. Oh! You might need these. Oh, I'm, I'm sorry. It's... in case of emergency. Well, have a wonderful dinner. I'll try. Enjoy your dinner, sir. Get out! Hey, what are you doing? - Hey, no. Who... - Sean. Derek! Derek! - Yo? - No. No fucking way. Yeah, I knew you'd say that. That's why I'm driving. Yeah, no shit. Because they're nice people, Derek. Come on. Dawg, they drive a Range Rover. They get, like, two miles per gallon. No, they're assholes. Coming from the guy who doesn't recycle. Where's the registration? Yes! Oh, hell, yeah, man. Look, straight up Burnside. They're less than a mile away from you. Ah... I don't like it, man. Two parents with their kids. What does that mean? I know, I know what you're gonna say. That's right. Nobody's home. Saying it doesn't actually make it so, though, Derek. Look, if I see an alarm sign, I'll bail out, all right? You're already halfway there, aren't you? I'll see you in ten minutes, brother. Pssh. What's the point of even having it? Ah, is everything satisfactory with your meal? - It's wonderful, thank you. - Ah, indeed. Hello. Whoa! Easy, boy. Easy. Easy, boy. Stay. Stay. Oh, shit! Oh! Oh! Oh! What? Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Why don't you get out in the air tonight? Don't! Oh, shit! Shit. No! Oh. I made better tips washing cars, bro. Yep. It wasn't a banner night for customer service. Can't wait for it to be over. - Ah, look at this. - Wait a minute. No, no. Run it through the Cayman offshore, our S.E.C. problem goes away. You're slipping, Mitchell. Fat fucking ride. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang back, it's my turn. Welcome to Nino's, sir. It's paddle-shift. So, don't go breaking the ears off thinking it's your granny's Vauxhall. Anyone smokes anything near my car, we'll have a problem. Try not to sweat. You smell like a drum circle. For God sake, don't park under any fucking trees, huh? - Oh, that's, that's a beautiful car, sir. - Yeah, don't fucking touch it. No, no. 10,000 is good for now. I'll, I'll call you. I have something new breaking. Calculating directions. You will arrive at your destination in three minutes. Destination has been reached. All right. Here we go. Fuck. Oh, you beauty! Yeah, we're in. Lovely. All right. No alarm? Oh, wow! It really pays to be a complete arsehole. Oh! Oh, you! Yes! Oh, shit. Yo, talk to me. You're sitting comfortably, Derek? Brand spanking new black card came in today's mail. Shut up, dawg! For real? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He doesn't even know it's here. Bro, we're gonna buy, like, 50 iPhones tonight, dawg. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. eBay scam, yeah. Dude, that card's gonna make us $15,000 in two days, bro. Fuck, man. I could take Riley to Maui. Are you kidding me, man? I'm moving outta my mom's. Yeah, well, it's about time, you fucking slacker. All right, listen to me. Is the sticker still on the card? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Guy's name is: Cale Erendreich. Yeah, it says: Call to activate, then the number. Awesome! Okay, look. You gotta call from the number tied to his account, all right? Try calling from his house phone. Everything cool on your end, yeah? I got it cold, bro. What about our old Douchey Douchendreich? They're just getting their salads now, man. Oh, fuck! Gotta track down the missing cordless. It's not on the base. Well, look by the TV, dawg. No, it's... - No, nothing. - Ah, well, hey. Yeah, well, he probably took it to his office or something. That's what I do. No, you don't have an office. You take yours in the shitter. Hey, man! I do my best thinking in there. It's upstairs. Fuck! All right. Let's check in here. Guest room. Any sign of kids? I'd be amazed if this prick has a goldfish. Just heard it. Got it. Awesome, awesome, awesome! 555-0199. Thank you for calling to activate your new card. Please, enter your card number as it appears on the card. Okay, darling. Anything you say. 74960390. Please wait a moment. Your card is being activated. Come on, baby. Your card has been activated. - Yes! - Good bye. Yes! I love that woman. Oh! Kinky bastard. Guy's got handcuffs by his bed. You're not touching those, are you? No. Okay, we're done with this room. Huh. There's another door here. It's like seriously fortified, though. What do you mean? Like an office? Yeah. Maybe. Hey, bro, well, you don't buy a lock unless you got shit worth stealing. Well, my thoughts exactly, Derek. It's got this big mad lock on it, though. Gee, too bad you don't have the keys, right? No, no. Look, look. We've been gone long enough. Let's not be greedy, all right? Are you crazy, man? What is, what is a perfect score? The perfect score? Cut the bullshit. One so big you never have to pull another one, stupid! All right, all right, all right. Fine, fine, fine. Stay there. Okay, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! No. - Cheers. - No. No. Next. Oh, yes! We're in! Boo-ya. Yep, it's an office all right. Going to the computer now. It's unlocked! Holy shit! Yes, okay, okay, okay. You're looking for a password file, all right? Everybody has one. - But you gotta search content. - Content. Yeah, I know how to search for fucking passwords. Thank you. Password... Searching, searching. Two minutes, it says. You got time, man. Ooh, checkbook! - It's only got one check in it, though. - No, that's cool, man. All you need is the account number and the routing number. Oh, yeah. I guess that pays off. Okay. Jesus fucking Christ! Whoa, whoa.! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Jesus Christ! - Okay. - Help! Okay, don't worry. - No! - No, no, no. Listen, listen, look. I'm just gonna take the thing out... out of your mouth. Come out, you fuck... fucker! Oh, God! Help me, help me, please! Help me, please! I am. I'm gonna help you. - Listen. - We don't have much time. What do you mean? I will be right back with you, sir. Thank you so much. Okay, twenty. - It's gotta be one of these. - Hmm? No, no, no, it's none of those. It's none of those. It's a skeleton key. It's on a leather chain. Where? Where? Where is it? It's on his neck. Oh, shit. Leaving so soon? Yeah. I have to. What, are you writing a book? - I just need my car. - Yeah. Right away. Uh... You know, I got this couple right ahead of you, and then, no worries, I got you. Hold on. No, it's never gonna work! It's bolted to the floor. Oh, fuck! I've gotta find a way through these chains. Sean, where are you, dude? Sean! Dude, listen, I've gotta call you back. - Where the hell are you? - What? Dude, the guy's outside, man. I got his fricking ticket. He wants his car back. I can't even explain over the phone. - This... - I don't give a shit. Just get the hell back here right now before we go to jail. What, what's the problem, huh? The thing is I, I, I shouldn't even be here. No, I don't care if you're robbing the place! I don't care! I'll never tell anyone. I swear. I swear to God. Please. Okay. I'm gonna get you outta here. I just need to find something to cut through this fucking chain. Okay, um... Downstairs, I think he had, he had tools. - Downstairs in the garage cage. - Okay. Hey, wait! Wait. Put the chair back. - What? - Look! It's not on, but, but he can check it. Holy shit! Oh. Hey, uh, turn off the light and put that thing back in my mouth. Just in case. Okay. Okay. You ready? Come on. Listen to me. - I'm gonna be right back. - Okay, go. I promise, I promise. Yes! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Fuck. Fuck Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck! You guys get home safe, and uh... thank you guys so much for coming out tonight. Really appreciate it. And you, sir. You, uh... you had the, uh... Maserati. Right, uh... was it, was it the blue one? The only one in your fucking lot. Of course. I'll be right up. All right, sir. I'll, I'll be right back. Oh, fuck! What do I owe you? Hello? Here. Oh, that was fucking close. Where the hell were you? He's... he's got a girl... He's got a girl? No, like, like chained up. Like a fucking animal. What the fuck are you talking about? Look, look. Oh, my God! But, he's... he's on the way back there now. I have to call the police. Hey man, you know they're gonna have your number, right? I'll, I'll, I'll do *67. No, man, that shit doesn't work for 911. - Your number pops up anyway. - Well, so what? So what? Dude... - We'll both get busted. - But, you didn't talk to her. You didn't... leave her there for that fucking monster! 911. What is your emergency? There's a girl being held captive at... 8723 Green Lake Vista, in Portland. She's... she's chained up in his office. She's in serious danger. Send the police now. Do you understand what I'm telling you? Yes, I understand, sir. Have you seen this woman? Uh, just... Please, please, help her. Ah. You did good, man. Relax, you already did all you can do. No, no, I didn't. Dude, where the hell are you going? To make sure it gets done. Oh, and get rid of this. And our little side venture is over. I'm never so much as stealing a piece of gum for the rest of my life. Thank you for calling to activate your new card. Please, enter your card number as it appears on the card. All righty. - You guys have a great dinner? - Uh-huh. All right, ma'am. Here's your key. Uh, all, all right, sir. Here's your key. - A key for you, sir. - What do we owe you? Ten. Oh, no, no, no. It's on the house, guys. Don't worry about it. All your cars are right here on the street. You guys have a wonderful evening. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Shit. I'm trying, man. No! No! Oh, fuck. Yes! Come on, baby. Come on, get him! May I help you? Can you take a step outside, sir? Okay. - We got a call about this... - Now, you fucker! Now, I've got you. Hey. What's going on? Ma'am? Ma'am, do you wanna step down here and have a talk with me for a minute? Do you mind stepping outside? I've got a couple of questions I'm going to ask you. - How long have you been living here? - Over five months since summer. All right, I got one more. - Is there anybody else in your house? - No, it's just us. Okay, have a good evening, ma'am. No, go into the fucking house! Go in! There you go. - Okay. - Thank you. Come on, honey. Thank you. Thank you, officer. - Okay, I think we need to... - What the fuck! - You guys have a good evening. - And you. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Rober? - Yeah. No, you fucking idiots! 60, 70, 80. Okay, Nino, your money's right there. Papa, see you, okay? - Wait, just a minute. - Okay. - That was a trick for tonight? - Uh, yeah. Never a dull moment with you though, is there? It's too bad you have to work early. I have some tricks I haven't busted out yet. Oh. I bet that you do. Mmm. See you soon. Good night. Fuck. Oh, fuck! Fuck. Come on. Fuck. Jesus. - Sean, open up, bro. - God's sake. Get in. Quick! All right. So, what did I miss? He had another girl in there. So, who's the girl? - Some ho? - No. No, she had a day job. She sounded more like... a booty call. But, he got her here so quick. Which means, on top of everything else, this guy's like a monster fucking player. Hey, man, I thought I told you to tint these windows, dawg. Oh, yeah. I should take your advice on more life decisions. Hey, I didn't make you come here, man. No, I know. I know you didn't. Why didn't you just give the girl his phone, man? Do you think I haven't asked myself that a million fucking times? Because I panicked. Okay? I got scared. I saw that murderous shit in the garage, and I fucking... And I bailed. And it was the worst fucking decision of my life. Hey, man, you never gotta apologize for being scared, bro. Just... I don't know, man, make another anonymous call or something. No. Fuck that. For all we know, he's got a stack of brunettes lined up to vouch for him. No. We wait until he leaves, and we use these. Most people forget to lock the door from the garage to the kitchen. I forget myself sometimes. And over here is your point of entry. We've never opened that window, ever. Well, doesn't take much. Even a quarter inch, and a good thief will catch it. There's been a rash of it lately. Do you know how to use that? I ain't going in there with just a hacksaw, bro. Just be careful, man. Look, look, look. Oh, he's leaving. He's fucking leaving. - Come on! Come on! - Oh, shit. Fuck, here he comes. Get down. - Do you think he saw us? - No. - You ready? - Let's go. Let's fucking do it. Come on. Fuck. - Fuck. - Psst, Sean. - The window's open. - What? Come on. Got it. Give me a boost. All right, all right. This way. I'd like to report a break in in progress at my neighbor's: 8723 Green Lake Vista. Thank you. All right. My fucking leg. Wait. What the hell? What? There was a massive lock right there. No, no, no, no, no. This isn't... Hey, man, are you sure this is the right room? Yes, man, she was here. She was chained here. This isn't possible. There was no carpet. What? The carpet. Where? Shh, shh. Oh, shit! Oh, fuck. Go, go, go. - Come on, come on, come on! - All right. Hey, there. Don't let tears distract us from our work. Comportment is a virtue. You've been such a help tonight. You've earned the next stage in your evolution. And the vulgar shall be corrected. That window that you hopped through, that wasn't open before. I'm 100% positive of that, which means... which means that he left it for us. Are you crazy? No, man, forget it. Dude, look. Let's just chill here for a little bit and let things cool down, all right? Then I'll take you back to your car. Just take me to the police station. - Sean, man. - It's a girl's life, - Derek. - Dude, just make another call. - Fuck that. - Oh, my God! - Sean! - No. They need to see my face. They need to see this. Dude, she's probably already dead by now. Derek. That's somebody's little girl. Um, what if this was your sister? My sis... If it was my sister, I'd go out there and save her myself. We tried that, didn't we? We tried that, and it didn't work! We're... I mean, we're, we're, we're in way over our heads here. Dude. - You know, you're going to jail, right? - Yeah, well, I deserve to go to jail! Look, man. You wanna get locked up, that's on you, okay? People don't like me, dawg. People don't like my family, man. My brothers, they already made sure of that shit. The dudes from the neighborhood, the dudes that did this shit... they're just sitting in county, man, waiting with nothing to do. They see my punk ass walk in through those gates,... it's open season on me, dawg. They'll fucking kill me, man. Okay, you were never there. I was alone. It's the only lie I'm telling. This place is really important to me. I don't show it to just anyone. Only when I see something really special. That wild spark. We don't need this anymore. I won't scream. No. Nah. Nah! No, you won't. Lift up your hair. What do you want from me? Well. Your dressage, your training... is shaped like a pyramid. You're in the middle,... learning rhythm... and routine. And what's at the top? The top? Freedom. I'm clean. I'm clean, I swear. I did it all exactly as you asked. Circular motions? Circular motions, using the correct soap and lotion, in the order you told me. What are you doing? Go to bed! This could be anywhere. For all I know, it's your girlfriend. She's not my girlfriend. What were you doing at this guy's house? I was robbing it. - What did you steal? - His credit card. Which you say you don't have. What happened to it? I lost it. Evading an officer, reckless driving, destruction of public property, parking meter, a bus stop, and a fire hydrant, that's a trifecta. What's that got to do with anything that we're, we're talking about? You know, you've got a lot to lose if you get busted. Like your green card. Do you think I'd walk in here if I didn't have to? I'll be honest with you, I, I really don't know why you're here. To save a girl's life. This girl that you left tied up. Yeah. Look. You can do whatever you want to me, send me to jail, deport me, I don't care. And she wasn't tied, by the way, she was chained, and strapped with leather, like a fucking horse. And the guy that lives there did that to her. This guy, Erendreich. Cale Erendreich. Yes, the same name I've been saying for four fucking... excuse my language, hours. Just please. Please, go find the guy. Yeah, we're making some calls. But, you should go to his house. - I mean, there's gotta be clues. - We've been to his house twice. First time, he was with a woman, not the girl in the picture. Both my officers confirmed that. Yeah, 'cause he knew something was up. That's why he had the other woman there, the taller one with the darker hair. - How would you know that? - Because... Because I was watching. Can I help you? Whoa, sorry about that. All right. Are you Cale Erendreich? I am. Sir, we're investigating some alleged crimes in the neighborhood. Possibly a break in? Would it be okay if I came inside, had a look? How do you take your coffee? I'm embarrassed enough you were called out once last night. I wasn't aware there was a second call. We rang the bell for a while. Well, I went to the store to get milk for the morning. I was gone, maybe a half hour. You married, Mr. Erendreich? Single. But dating, you know? But, no... girl chained up in the office? Sorry to disappoint you. Garage. Nice set. Thanks. Something's missing though. Uh, yeah, bolt cutters. Uh, lent them to a friend. I never lend my tools. They don't seem to come back. He'll give them back. Sorry. Sorry you had to see that. No problem. Yeah, everything's here. Laptop, valuables, a little bit of cash. I'd love to tell you something's missing, but it's not. Do you have any reason to think that somebody would wanna hurt you? No. I'm just a guy. Okay. You know, now that you mention it. I have been getting a lot of prank calls. Hang ups. Calls where the caller doesn't say anything. Any idea who it is? Oh... who knows. You know, like I said, I'm a single guy. Some of the women I date have ex-boyfriends, I just figured, you know... Say no more, it's all beginning to make sense. Here. Oh, you, by any chance, eat at Nino's last night? Nino's? That place down the street? If I want Northern Italian, I go to La Finestra. - It's worth the drive. - Yeah, I'll have to check it out. Good coffee, by the way. - Better than the shit I buy. - Ha! Oh, uh... one last thing. The window. I noticed the screen was ripped open, like someone cut it with a knife. How did that happen? Oh, that was all me. A couple weeks ago I had to break into my own house after a run. I really should hide a key somewhere. Be sure to hide it well. You're free to go. Mr. Erendreich's not pressing charges. What? What? Wait, so you... you spoke to him? I sat in his kitchen. And you didn't arrest him? For what, Sean? For kidnapping, for false imprisonment. Jaywalking, I don't know. Anything to get him off the streets. Were you drinking last night? - Listen to me, I'm telling you the truth. - Here's what I think. In your mind, you think this guy stole some girlfriend of yours. No! No! No! I don't even know her name. I can't think of any other reason why you'd waste my time with all this bullshit. But, I tell you what. If so much as a newspaper gets jacked from that neighborhood, my first move is arresting you. Hang on. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, so, you're, you're gonna stay on him, right? You're gonna keep searching for the girl? For all I know, you got that picture off of Tumblr. - Because it wasn't taken at his house. - Oh, my God, this isn't happening. - God, this isn't happening. - I'll tell you what's not happening. Me locking you up for making a phony 911 call, which I could absolutely do. Whatever beef you've got with Erendreich, you stay the fuck away from him, you hear me? Stop harassing him. I'm not making this up. You wanna file a missing person? Try the FBI. Is this who came to see you? Yes? Good. You're so good. - Oh. - Thank you, Sean. Yo, so... Is that it? We have what we need. So, now you, like... match her face with some missing persons data base, huh? I can't discuss an investigation. But, there is an investigation? Okay. You know, but I can identify her, you know? So... if you need me, you'll give me a call? You should go home. Look, I'm sorry. Just, please. I just need... to know that's she's okay. Great. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! - Records. - Hey, this is Fuller. Can you bring the Valkenberg file to my desk? - Oh, the cold case? - Yeah, the trust fund kid. Digital copy, okay? - No, I want a hard copy. - Okay, no problem. Nino's. What kinda place you running, man? Excuse, uh, what do you mean? My wife and I just ID'd one of your little parking valets, down at the goddamn police station. We come and eat at your restaurant and this is how you repay us, by robbing our house? What? Um, no, sir. Quite a racket you got, pal. Cop said, it's been happening for months! You know, my wife works for Immigration and Customs. I sure hope everybody in your kitchen has their goddamn papers. What time is it? One fifty-four. She should be here. Sean! What are you doing here? - Hey, can we just... - Hey. Oh! What? Okay, what's wrong? Nothing, just, I haven't slept. Look, I need to talk to you. Yeah, of course, darling. - But, I... - Riley, we gotta go. Just blow it off. I can't. I have a presentation. It's worth a third of my grade. Something's happened. I'll be done in 90 minutes. You can tell me everything then. - Okay? - Okay. Okay. - Meet me at my place? - Yeah, sure. Okay, I love you, sweetie. Love you, too. Okay. Listen, there's no way I can work today, man. I haven't slept. And I can't get iron girl outta my head. Who? I just can't stop thinking that... maybe... we're both... trapped in that house together. You know what I mean? It's like I've never left. Yeah, man. No worries. It's all good. I got your back. What the fuck? What? Hey, I'll call you back. Yo! What the hell you doing here, man? This is our account. - Not no more. - Says who? Nino. Yeah? How about I kick your country ass face in? - I'm standing right here, bitch. - Boys. Boys, we can't have no trouble. Nino, what's going on, man? - This ain't right. - No trouble. You go, huh? He's asking nice. I'm not. - Fuck you, man. This is bullshit. - Yeah? It's fucking bullshit, Nino. Don't come back, bitch. Fuck you! You're excused. A glacier may move in two ways. The first is glacial internal flow. Uh, this is caused by the gravity and internal pressure pushing the glacier formation... to lower elevation. It's not unlike knocking over a stack of cards. As you can see, this means the top of the glacier is moving faster than the bottom because of friction with the ground. Basal sliding is caused by the base of the glacier melting. This is like an ice cube on a countertop. As it melts, the base becomes slippery. Glaciers move very slowly. Most of the time, only... a few centimeters each day. Occasionally, a glacier speeds up. When a glacier speeds up... It's her. It's called surging. A surging glacier can advance tens or even... hundreds of meters a day. What's that smell? I had to fish this shit out of the garbage. Well, don't bring it into the flat. Just leave it there, all right? Sit down. I'll get you some ice for your eyes. Thanks, man. I swear to God, man. I outta go back with my HK and show those goddamn rednecks - what's what. - Let it go, man. I mean,... we're lucky we're not in jail. Thanks. So, how many of them were there? Bitch, shut up. I don't know what I did to you, but you are such an asshole. What the...? I have to go. I, I, I'm really sorry, man. Riley? Riley, can you hear me? If someone can hear me... You got some fucking nerve coming here. - I didn't do this. - Okay. It wasn't me, Jocelyn. - Riley! Just... - Hey, she doesn't wanna talk to you! Hey, do you want me to call security? I don't know what happened. All right, please. - Riley, for two minutes, talk to me. - You know what? This building is for students only. - Get the fuck out of here! - Listen to me for a second. - I didn't do this, okay? - Whatever. Tell that to her dad. - Riley, please! Please. - Asshole! - Riley, please! - Fuck! Security! Riley! Jesus! Jesus Christ! Hello? Do you know why you're not in their little jail right now? Why? Because you're in mine. I will correct you. Riley, I would never disrespect you like that. I love you. You've, you've gotta believe me. Just call me back. Please. Maybe, he's telling the truth. I mean... It's just so out of character for him. I can't believe you're considering this. I need to look him in the eye. Well, how about I wait in the car? With a gun? I won't be long. Ah, Jesus. Ri... Riley! Don! Don, I need your truck. I can explain later. What's wrong? I got fired. They said I was stealing company property. You believe that shit? I said, "Don Falco is no thief. You wanna check my truck, you go ahead." They found almost 10 grand of equipment... sitting in the back. I'm no thief. I know you're not. I know. Babe? Why aren't you at work? I've been suspended. There's a claim that I assaulted a child, as if I'd ever do such a thing. I have to tell you exactly what's going on. And, Don... you can punch me in the face, whatever, when, when I'm done. But right now, you have to listen to me because we're not safe. None of us. Riley! Riley. Riley! Oh, my God! Derek? Derek, can you call me? - Sorry. - Sorry, love. Call me back as soon as you get this, please? Just pack your essentials, Patty, anything else, we'll buy. Rowan? Hey, Rowan. That thing still have photo editing software, yeah? Dad says, we have to get ready. Wait, one second, one second. P.O. Box 21... San...? San... Sandy. Holy, shit! You are not taking the car. You are not going anywhere, except the Radisson where I'm checking us in. Then you, me, and a lawyer are going to the cops, - and they will believe you this time. - We can do that after. - Please, Dad. - Oh, now I'm Dad? I'm, I'm, I'm begging you. Please. I have to protect my family. And that includes you. Not some girl we don't know. He's gonna kill her. You don't even know her name. Look. You have always encouraged me to do the right thing. This time, I have to do the right thing. I have to. I'll meet you at the hotel. I promise. - Sean. - All right? Sean! There will be an unholy correction. There will be fire! No breakfast. Positive match on the girl. She went missing three weeks ago. I've run this six times. From what he told us about the leather straps and iron chains, it's the same M.O. as Phoenix, Memphis, and Denver. Your trust fund phantom again. Christ, Fuller, we need to find you a hobby. I'll make a deal with you, sir. if we catch this guy, I'll learn to cook. So, you wanna say Cale is the Valkenberg kid all grown up? That kid would be close to 40 now. The right age. White male, medium build. It's 40 million Americans. I know, but every one of these cases has, at least, a tangential tie to Portland. There is something about Oregon that he likes. What? I don't know yet. Okay. Your trust fund theory tracks. I'll give you that. Here's my problem. Your little valet friend could not have less credibility No! You're killing him! Out of chaos comes order. I define the chaos. I create the order, not you, not him. You understand? I understand. I am the decider! - Riley. - Is this Sean Falco? Who is this? You're listed as an emergency contact for Riley Seabrook. - What? - She's been admitted to the hospital. What hospital? Hey. Hey, Riley. Sweetheart. This is my fault. I messed up. The man who did this to you... is trying to hurt me because I broke into his house. Because that's what I've been doing. Because I'm a fucking idiot, just a... common stupid thief. And now he's... hurt you, and... I'm... I am so,... so sorry. Here, let me get it. Okay. Go away. What's up, fool? Where the fuck have you been? I had to pick up a few things. This guy, Erendreich,... he put Riley in the hospital. What are you talking about? He's trying to destroy my life in a million different ways. Yo, how do you know it's him, though? Because he called me, and he told me. He kept me out of jail, so that he could systematically fuck me. No, man, why the hell would he do something like that, huh? For the same reason he keeps a girl chained up in his office, to watch us break bit by bit. - Ma? - Derek. Would you listen to me, please? This guy, he's getting off on this. - Mmm. - You have to watch yourself. Do you hear me? Yeah, dawg. Well, he doesn't know who I am though. No, listen, man. I, I can't video chat, I'm driving. You can't do what? Video? Derek! Remember this? Huh, this? This you stole, huh? You thieving low pig. Look at this squalor. Oh. I mean... I honestly, don't know what he sees in you. You are beyond correction. Derek! Derek, listen to me. I'm on the way! Talk to me! Derek, please. Derek, can you hear me? Are you there? Pick up, Derek! Pick up the phone, please! Derek! Derek, pick up the phone! Oh! Got you, you fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! And you saw the gunshot? No, no, I, I heard it over the phone. Uh, just please send somebody. Derek Sandoval. He lives on Northwest Hamilton Street. I, I can't remember the number. Just, please. Wait, Hamilton? Sandoval residence. Yes, okay. We've had multiple calls. Officers have been dispatched. Oh, Jesus Christ. They're bumping us up to the lead. We're doing this live. - Listen to me, listen to me. - Hold. Listen to me. I know who did this, right? This was Cale Erendreich. The guy's name is Cale Erendreich. Look, this is a picture of him... which I just sent to the FBI. Agent Fuller at the FBI, I just sent this to her. What's your name? Sean Falco. Go sit on the curb. I'll get someone to take your statement. We're on in five, four, three... Thank you, Glenn. In what appears to be a murder suicide, claiming the lives of three residents, police are calling this: A domestic disturbance gone horribly wrong. Neighbors are out here looking at the scene. Everyone is on edge. We've tried to get some information... Shit. Come on. There must be something here! Sandy? Yes! Hurry now, little cowboy, come on down. Come on, stay with it. Ride it now. Yo, come on, now. Ride it now, little cowboy. Come on, people, make some noise now. Let me hear you all, - cheer him up now. - Right on. Hey, out there in radio land, yo, this is the best station in the city... Let's go to a caller... Holy fuck! Oh, my God! Boom! Oh! Oh! Oh, fuck me. Jesus! Oh. I'll put a hold on the land deal then. Anything else? I want you to wire 50,000 Canadian cashier's check to the Watterboro Bank, Vancouver. Watterboro Bank, Vancouver. Uh, Canada or Washington? Canada. You know, your father... - He wanted me to tell you... - Those people don't exist, Mitchell. I shouldn't have to correct you! Uh, Vancouver, Canada it is. I take it, I won't hear from you for a while? I'll find you when I need you, Mitchell. I always do. He sent this. Did you run this picture through NGI? Inconclusive. All right, let the face team have a look. Any word on Falco? Sean's still not answering, but his phone pinged off of a tower in Sandy 20 minutes ago. A guy like Cale wants privacy, some place rural. We believe out near Mt. Hood, due east to Sandy. If it's private property, you're gonna need a warrant. Turn left. Destination ahead. Agent Fuller! Some of that land is federal. The rest is owned by something called the Valkenberg family trust. Valkenberg. The trust fund? Hey, Eric. Call the judge on her call phone. I want her signing a warrant in 5 minutes. Move it. Don't stop. Get on the horn. I want everyone to know we're code 3 all the way there. You've got it. Let's go, let's go! Load up! Let's roll! So, Valkenberg, go. Valkenberg was an only child, billionaire father, obsessed with his prized horses. So the kid killed the horse trainer to get back at the dad? No, he was only 14, she was in her 20s. He had a crush on her. Tried to impress her by breaking a wild colt before it was ready. Ended up killing the horse instead. And when the trainer threatened to tell his father, he killed her. So now, instead of breaking horses... He breaks people. I'm gonna get you out. I'm gonna get you out. I'm gonna get you out of here. You hear me? I'm gonna get you out of here. Look out! God! Just lock, just lock me back up. Please, huh? Just let me starve. That would be inelegant. - No. - Wake up, Sean! No, no, you said you were gonna free me. - And I shall. - No, what? You're gonna let me go? Does it matter to you one way or the other? No. Sir. No, sir. No, sir. Pay attention, Sean! No. Don't, don't do it. Listen, listen. Take me, take me instead. Uh, it's not really an either-or situation. You're next. But first, you're gonna watch. And I get to watch you. Open your eyes, or I knee cap her. Oh, please. Cale, please. Who the fuck's Cale? - Sean, I swear to God, - No. I'll skin you alive. It'll take me 30 seconds. Open your fucking eyes. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No! Fuck! It's private property, Fuller. We still need a warrant. We're waiting. Fuck! Congratulations! You get to keep your skin. Well... at least until the lye takes hold. For the slightest minute there, you had me worried. That... screen-shot you took, I mean, uh-uh-uh-uh... that was some stone-cold brilliance right there. That was fucking inspired. I mean, finally,... somebody's earned the right to play in my sandbox. Huh? Even a piece of used jet trash. But then, you showed up here. And I knew that... your picture of me must be inconclusive. Otherwise, your little FBI friend, all the little knuckle-draggers would be tearing up the hillside. Not just you... alone... armed with some bolt cutters. Thank you for returning those, by the way. You know, I loathe disorder. If you're expecting the FBI to show up, you should know they're not looking for me. They're looking for her real killer. That's you. No way. I didn't kill anybody. Yeah, their investigation will uncover a different narrative. One that shows I'm working at levels... beyond your understanding. While you've been trying so hard to pin all this on me, I get the proof that all of it,... uh, Derek,... Riley, your idiotic burglaries... made the perfect cover for what you were really doing. Hunting. And why would I kill Derek? He was my best friend. Because he found out. They won't believe that. You have no idea how rich I am. They know... that I'm not capable of murder. No, we're not equals in that respect. That's why... I have planted a letter of confession on your hard drive. More of a manifesto, really. They'll find it. Cops love tidy endings. What are you smiling at? I'm just... You... are fucking crazy. You know that, right? No. No, no. Because crazy people get caught. And now,... see, what, for you has been the most... extraordinary adventure. Was just, for me, an ordinary day. A life void of guilt. Uh,... or entanglements, or politics. Truly free. You. You're the puzzle. A, a feeling so strong that you would risk your life... for some woman you don't even know. Inex-fucking-splicable. What did you think you'd accomplish coming here? I just did. Well, I hope it was all worth it because you're getting buried next to her. Except, you're going in alive. Oh! Oh. That's how you fucking save somebody! I'm sorry. Here, could you? Please. Huh? Oh. - Is he dead? - Hey, shut up. - Please, please. - Stop. - Hurry, hurry, hurry. - Stop moving! I can't see straight. Fuck! I'm covered in lye, asshole! - Look. - Huh? Give me that. Like, run! Oh, my God. - Oh! - Ah! Oh, all right. Get up! What was that? Probable cause? It's not enough. It's not enough. All right, let's go. All right, guys, let's go! Oh, my God. Here they are. Right on time.
