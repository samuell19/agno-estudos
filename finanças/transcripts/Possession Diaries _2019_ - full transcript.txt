(WINE POURING) (GLASS CLINKS) (FILM ROLLING) (FEMALE SNIFFLING) I... I'm not gonna do this anymore. I cannot do this anymore. I am tired, I am done. Well done. I am not going to let him take my soul!

(WOMAN SCREAMING) (LOW GROWLING) (BED CREAKING) (THUNDER CRACKING) (SKULL CRACKING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (LOUD THUDDING) (SOMBER MUSIC) (MONITOR STATIC) Hello everyone. My name is Rebecca Clarkson and today, well actually, for the rest of the week I'm gonna do be doing something different. Something that I haven't done before but I have to. It's the only way that I'm gonna get people to believe me and my story. First off, this is not a movie. I am not an actress. Everything you are gonna see is real. Now let's start from the beginning. I've decided to take this opportunity and document myself. I've been to a psychiatrist, I've talked to several priests, and no one believes me. So I'm taping myself for proof. It all started when I was messing with this. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Big mistake. It was only a few days ago that I was messing with this Ouija board and it was out of boredom. Days later, strange things started happening. I'm so scared. (REBECCA SOBBING) I haven't been feeling well. I've been hearing things at night. I haven't had a decent nights sleep since it all started. So this is the only way that I can prove to people that demonic possession is real. You may be wondering why I don't just leave this house. Well, it's not that simple. Everywhere I go it follows me. I'm gonna be calling this the Video Diaries. The Possession Diaries. Starting with today, day one. And right now it's 8:15 am. Alright. I'm gonna try and get some much needed sleep. I'll talk to you guys later. Bye. Hey guys. It's 12:45 pm. I've been tossing and turning in my bed since we last spoke. I can't go to sleep. It's hard because... (DOOR KNOCKING) Hold on. Come in! GIRL: (AT DOOR) Hey. Hey. Who are you talking to? Nobody. Nobody huh? What are you doing? Is this thing on? Yeah, I'm just making a video diary. A video diary? Yeah. Are you gonna put it on YouTube or something? Yeah, YouTube, Vimeo, Google, everywhere. What! Rebecca! What? I don't have any makeup on. Yeah, so? So I don't want my face all over the internet. Esmy, relax. No, no, are you really gonna put this online? Stop being so dramatic. Fine, just when you do whatever it is you're doing, can you edit me out of the final cut? Okay. Cool. Oh, so, the original purpose for coming in here was to tell you that I'm actually going out of town for a few days. Just to visit family. I'm gonna be here all by myself? You have Dante to keep you company. Yeah, but still. It's just until your birthday. On Halloween, that's six days from now. I know. But we'll celebrate when I get back. Alright. Well in that case I can wait. Great. So I'll leave the number on the fridge and I'll see you then. Okay. Have fun. Be safe. ESMY: You too. Okay. Bye. Bye. Hey guys. It's 8:33 pm. I have to go pee. I know, sorry, too much information, but every detail counts right now. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (FLOOR CREAKING) (ITEMS THUMPING) (TOILET FLUSHING) What the hell! Do you see? Do you see what's going on? Do you see the shit I have to deal with? (OMINOUS MUSIC) (GHOSTLY WINDS) (THUNDER CRACKING) Hello? (REBECCA SCREAMS) Hey guys. It's day two and right now it's 8:55 am. Almost nine o'clock. I was able to get some sleep since last night, but I still had nightmares. (REBECCA VOMITING) (TOILET FLUSHING) Sorry about that guys. I don't know what just came over me. Also, I just looked at myself in the mirror and my veins are coming out of my neck. I don't know if it's an allergic reaction to something or if it's the start of my possession. I don't know. I guess we'll have to wait and see. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? (PHONE BUZZING AND CLANKING) Hello? (PHONE RINGING) Hello? (PHONE LAUGHING) Hello? Get a life asshole! God. (PHONE RINGING) Who the hell is this? (MALE SCREAMING) MALE: (ON PHONE) Please forgive us! (GHOSTLY WINDS) (REBECCA SNEEZING) Oh shit. I got to go guys. Hey guys, I'm back. This is all really starting to get to me and I'm so scared. I called my boyfriend Dante and he's on his way over right now. I can't be here another night alone. (REBECCA SOBBING) (PHONE RINGING) That must be him. Hey babe. (PHONE BUZZING) Babe? MALE: (ON PHONE) Help me. (PHONE RINGING) Babe. MALE: (ON PHONE) Rebecca, help me! Dante, is that you?

Okay. DANTE: You okay sweetie? Yeah. The doors unlocked, just come on up. DANTE: Okay, I'll be right up. Okay, I'll see you in a second. Bye. DANTE: Bye. That was Dante. I can't let him know what just happened. I mean he already knows about the veins on my neck, but I have to see if I look okay. (WATER RUNNING) Rebecca! Rebecca! REBECCA: Hey babe. Hey. You know what babe, you shouldn't leave the door open when you're home alone. It's not safe. Oh babe, I'm a big girl. I think I can take care of myself. Is that right? REBECCA: That's right. Damn. You weren't lying about the veins huh? Is it that bad? Hell yeah. You gonna go to the doctors tomorrow? You got to go check them out. Well, I think I'm gonna wait a few days before I go. I don't know about that. I wouldn't do that if I was you. Babe. I'll be fine, thank you. If you say so. (COMPUTER BEEPING) What are you doing? Nothing, I'm just doing a video diary. For who? For whoever watches. Like online or something? Maybe. Yeah. Is that right? That's right. Why are you looking at me like that for? Babe. Hey, I said this is a video diary, not a porno. Okay? Whatever. I'm gonna go use the bathroom and then I'll come back and lay for a little bit, okay? Lay in bed, you just got here. Yeah I just got here. Got here straight from work and I'm tired. It's been a long day baby. Okay. Oh, and I got something for you. You got me something? Well my mom did. I told her about the bullshit you were going through and she said this will protect you. You told your mom? Yes, she believes you're going through something. Do you believe me? Hey, just be happy I told her okay? Hey guys. It's day three now and right now it's 8:33 am and I just woke up. (DANTE YAWNING) Babe, what are you doing? REBECCA: Sorry babe, did I wake you? DANTE: It's cool, but what are you doing though? I'm just ding my video diary. DANTE: Are you serious? What? DANTE: It's too early. Babe, it's part of my diary, I have to do it. DANTE: Whatever. REBECCA: What are you doing? I'm gonna go home. I got to go back to work in a few hours. Please don't go. I have to. But I'm scared. Scared of what? Never mind. Look, call me if there's an emergency okay? Oh, and chill out on the YouTube videos okay? They're video diaries. Love you too! Jerk. Alright guys, I got to go. (MONITOR STATIC) I can see you all. You pitiful creatures. I can feel your fears, it feeds me. I want your souls. I will not be stopped. I will fool you, I will trap you, and you will fall right onto my feet. (REBECCA LAUGHING) (LOUD SCRATCHING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (NAILS CRACKING) Oh my God. What did I just do to myself! Oh God. (REBECCA SOBBING) Hey guys. So you've seen the things that are happening to me in my room. It's all very disturbing. You saw it. (COMPUTER BEEPING) Are you fucking kidding me? None of this stuff that is happening to me is staged or fake, none of it! It's all fucking real! You know what, if you don't believe me then stop watching! (REBECCA SOBBING) I'm just at loss for words right now. But, you know what, the proof is there on the video. Whether you believe me or not, I'm not going crazy. I'm not. Something evil did something to me. It also did this. It hurts. I'm sorry. I just, I just wanna prove to people that what's happening to me is real. But you know what, I don't care. I don't care if you believe me. I'm gonna be continuing with my video diary. And in the end, it will prove that I'm right. (PHONE RINGING) Huh, that's strange. My phone's not supposed to accept blocked calls. (PHONE BEEPING) Hey, it's Rebecca, leave a message. (PHONE BEEPING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) (REBECCA SLAPPED) (REBECCA SCREAMS) MALE: (ON PHONE) Hello Rebecca. What the fuck? Who is that? MALE: (ON PHONE) The Devil. You have called upon me. And now I am here! No please. I didn't mean to, please. DEVIL: It is too late. Soon I will possess your soul! What do you want from me! DEVIL: Your soul! Is there anything I can do to fix this? DEVIL: No. Just go back to hell where you came from! Just go! DEVIL: It's not that simple. You have awakened me. Fine then you fucking bastard! I'm prepared to fight you until the end! DEVIL: So be it. (DEVIL LAUGHING) REBECCA: No. (PHONE BEEPING) PHONE: You have no messages. (REBECCA GRUNTS) Is there anyone out there that can help me? (COMPUTER BEEPS) My God. Some of you guys do believe me. Thank you, thank you so much for your kind words. (COMPUTER BEEPS) You're right, I will consider it. Thank you Carmen, you give me hope. WOMAN: (ON PHONE) Hello? Hey Aunt Peggy, it's Rebecca. Oh hi Rebecca. Long time no hear. What's up sweetheart? Nothing much. Haven't talked to you in a while so I just wanted to call and say hi. Well it's really great hearing your voice. Yeah, you too. Listen, I was wondering if you could possibly send your psychic friend over to my house. Well sure, but I thought you didn't believe in psychics? I'm just curious about something and I would really love her advice. Okay, sure. I'll give her a call and see if she can come over to your house. Okay, that's great. Thank you. When do you want to see her? Oh. Well today or tomorrow at the latest. Why so urgent? Aunt Peggy, it's kind of personal and I really don't have time to explain it right now. But if you could give her my phone number and address and send her over right away. You still have my information right? Yeah of course. Okay great. Listen, I have to go but thank you and I love you. Love you too. Bye. Bye. Alright guys, I have to go, but I'll be back in a little bit. (EERIE MUSIC) Oh my God. What, what is it? Why did you bring me here? Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I'm really scared right now and I don't know what to do. I believe you. You do? Yes. But I haven't even told you what... You don't have to tell me. This thing, this, this evil presence in your house and especially in this room. It's trying to take control of something. Yes. Yes, that something is me. It's the devil and he wants my soul! Yes, I know! (PSYCHIC BREATHES HEAVILY) Are you okay? Are you okay? I'm alright. I'm alright. It's just, being in here is so overwhelming. I can't believe it. You're the only person right now that believes me. The devil is very strong. I know. And I'm so scared and I don't know what to do. There's only one option. What do you suggest? I have a friend who's a priest... Forget it. Why? Because, priests, nuns, psychologists, I've been to them all and none of them believe me. You have to leave this house. Go stay in a hotel somewhere tonight, we'll come pick you up in the morning and come back here. And he'll tell us what he thinks we should do. I can't. Why not? It's not safe here. Because it doesn't matter where I go! It doesn't matter what I do, he follows me! There's no point in trying to run! I understand. Here, take this. What is it? It'll help protect you from harm until I come back tomorrow. How does it work? Just sprinkle it on the bed and the areas that you are the most. It won't stop the evil from attacking you but it'll make it not as bad. I'll come back tomorrow. Please call me if you need anything else. Thank you. It feels so good to finally have someone believe me. (FAINT CRACKING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (REBECCA GASPING) (LOW GROWLING) DANTE: Rebecca! In here. Babe, what's wrong with you? Help me. Oh my God. DANTE: What's wrong with you babe? Babe, you won't believe me. Babe, what happened to your neck? I didn't do it. What? You won't believe me. Shh, calm down baby. Calm down okay? Come on, let's just go lay. Babe. Babe, so much weird stuff has been happening and no one believes me. DANTE: Just relax. Calm down baby okay? We're gonna lay together for a few minutes, okay. REBECCA: I can't, I can't! Relax. I can't do this anymore. DANTE: Calm down baby, come on, shh. REBECCA: No please, please. Come on, we'll just lay with each other. Just for a few seconds. And if you want, we can talk about it okay. But just relax baby, it's okay. Shh. (REBECCA CRYING) Calm down baby. I'm here baby. I'm here okay. Shh. Shh.

DANTE: No I'm not daydreaming! You tried to stab me, bye! Babe, I'm being serious! REBECCA: Hello? Oh my God. Oh my God! Oh my poor baby, he was right. Oh my God! Oh my God. (REBECCA SOBBING) Hey guys, it's day five and right now it's 1:13 pm. My boyfriend Dante broke up with me because I tried stabbing him with a knife this morning. But it wasn't me, it was the Devil. I would never do anything like that. But I have to stay strong, I can't let this get to me. I have to continue these diaries. So other than feeling severely depressed, I feel weird. I feel like I'm losing myself more and more each day. So on that note, I'm going to be writing a letter to my roommate Esmy or anyone that finds it. So whoever finds this letter, including you Esmy, it means I didn't survive the possession. (PHONE RINGING) It's Dante. We broke up remember. I'm not picking up. Hey, it's Rebecca, leave a message. (PHONE BEEPING) DANTE: Rebecca, pick up! Pick up Rebecca, I know you're there! Listen you fucking bitch, I will gut you like a fish! You understand me! I will take the knife you tried to stab me with, slice it down the middle of your stomach and rip out your insides and hang you from your own fucking guts you fucking whore! (DANTE AND DEVIL LAUGHING) (PHONE BEEPING) Yeah? How dare you threaten me? DANTE: What are you talking about? You know, it's one thing to break up with me, but then to threaten my life? How dare you! DANTE: What are you talking about? I never threatened you. You're tripping. I got your message asshole! Listen to this. (PHONE BEEPING) FEMALE: Rebecca, pick up! Pick up Rebecca, I know you're there! Listen you fucking bitch! I will gut you like the fish you are! You understand me! I will take that knife you tried to stab me with and slice you down the middle of your stomach and rip your insides until they hang out with your own fucking guts you fucking whore!

(REBECCA SCREAMING) Christ eternal commands you! Our Lord, Jesus Christ the eternal Christ commands you! (SOMBER MUSIC) Who are you? Rebecca. Father will she be okay? Hey guys. It's still day five and Father Brien and Esmeralda just left not too long ago. So after they left I took a shower and after, I looked at myself in the mirror and noticed that the veins are still on my neck. I was hoping that after the exorcism that they would be gone. But I'm hoping that it's just taking a little bit longer than I expected. Anyways, I finished my letter and I'm going to be keeping it right here next to my computer. I'm gonna go lie down now. I'm really not feeling well and I have a huge headache. Also, this is gonna be the end of my diary because I survived my possession. But I'll come back and I'll talk to you guys in a little bit. Okay, bye. Hey guys. So, of course, again, I didn't get any sleep. As usual. But while I was lying in bed I came to the stunning realization that tomorrow is day six of the diary. Which is also my birthday, Halloween. And I was just lying there thinking how incredibly thankful I am to be able to live through another birthday. But you know what? I know now that I have nothing to worry about anymore. The Devil is gone and I can feel things slowly starting to get back to normal. So on that note, I won you motherfucker! You will never get my soul! Here is to you asshole! Fuck! Oh my God, this is impossible. Hey Andrew. Yeah, I'm good, how are you? Listen, I need a huge favor from you. Hey what's going on with you? I thought you was playing games with me. If I told you what's going on you wouldn't believe me. Try me. I'm up for anything. It's a long story. Hey. What's wrong with your face? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm just not feeling good. Listen, I need you to get rid of this for me. Awe man. This is some evil shit you got here. Did you play with it? Yes. And it scared the shit out of me. That's why I need you to burn it. Did you let something out? What? No, no, not really, no. Oh come on, tell me! I'm all into this paranormal shit! Do you really wanna know? Yeah! The Devil himself. You're lying. The Devil has no need for this. Only demons and spirits channel through this. I told you you wouldn't believe me. No, no, no, no. I believe you. It's just that, this is some serious shit! I know Andrew. Listen, I need you to just get rid of it for me. Okay, alright, no problem, no problem. Listen, I'm gonna burn this fucker to the ground alright? Thank you. ANDREW: No problem. Hey, anything else you need from me, I'm just a phone call away. (PHONE RINGING) Hello. AUNT PEGGY: Rebecca. (PEGGY SOBBING) Aunt Peggy, are you okay? It's about Esmeralda and Father Brien. What, what happened? I think they were involved in this horrific car crash. I was talking to Esmeralda on the phone and she was trying to tell me. She was screaming. But I couldn't quite make out what she was saying. What are you talking about Aunt Peggy? I don't know. She was talking something about that she had to warn you about the Devil or something and then, then I heard this really loud crash in the background and then the line went dead before I knew what was happening. Find out if they're okay. Please call me back! Of course. I'll call you back in a bit okay. Okay. So, I just got off the phone with my Aunt Peggy and, and, oh my God. Father Brien and Madame Esmeralda died earlier today due to their injuries from a car accident. I feel like it's all my fault. (PHONE RINGING) Hey, it's Rebecca, leave a message. (PHONE BEEPING) (LOUD SCREAMING) DEVIL: You didn't think it's over did you? Oh my God, you played me. I thought you were gone. DEVIL: I don't give up that easy. It's called playing along. (LOUD SCREAMING) It's going to take more than a pathetic exorcism to get rid of me. Just leave me alone! DEVIL: I won't do that until I get what I want! You, you're the one that killed them. You killed Father Brien and Esmeralda didn't you? DEVIL: Yes. And I will kill anyone who tries to interfere with my doing. No! Leave them alone, leave everyone alone! If you have a problem, just deal with me! DEVIL: Their blood is on your hands now. Rebecca, I suggest you let me have your soul before other lives are lost. Do I need to show you more? No, no. DEVIL: That's a good girl. I will see you soon. (PHONE BEEPING) You fucking bastard! I am not afraid of you! I'm not afraid of you anymore! Do you hear me! I'm not afraid of you! Fuck! (REBECCA SOBBING) So guys, I guess it's not over yet. (LOUD CLANKING) What the fuck is that? Shit. (LOUD THUMPING) Fuck! What the fuck! Who made this mess? (REBECCA SCREAMING) Stay away from me! Stay away! (DEVIL GROWLING) No, somebody help me! Let go of me, let go! No! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS) Stay away from me!

ESMERALDA: You must tell her about the Devil. The Devil, it's not gone! AUNT PEGGY: What? Esmeralda, there must be a really bad connection going on here because I mean, I can barely hear you. ESMERALDA: She's not safe! It's not over. AUNT PEGGY: What? What's not over? What are you talking about? Esmeralda? Esmeralda? (TIRES SCREECHING) FATHER BRIEN: No! (CAR SHATTERING) AUNT PEGGY: Oh. Oh my God. Oh my God! Esmeralda? Esmeralda! Esmeralda! (PHONE DIAL TONE) Esmeralda, Father Brien I'm so sorry. (PHONE RINGING) (REBECCA SOBBING) Hello? Are you alright? I am Peggy. I'm sorry to call you so late, but I really had this bad dream about you. Maybe it was the sandwich I ate before I went to bed. But are you okay? I'm okay Aunt Peggy. Is it about Esmeralda and Father Brien? It's a lot of things Aunt Peggy. Besides Esmeralda and Father Brien, is something else bothering you? Listen Aunt Peggy, I have to go. Listen, I know that there's something that you're not telling me. Esmeralda was going to tell me. Why won't you talk to me? Because you wouldn't have believed me if I told you. They were the only ones that believed me. I have to prove it now. What? What? I don't understand. Aunt Peggy, please, just pray for me. Please just pray for me. Please, please, you're starting to scare me. I have to go, I love you. Alright, I'll pray for you. REBECCA: Okay bye. I love you too. Hey guys, it's day six. Happy Halloween and happy birthday to me. I didn't wake up until just now. I slept the whole day away. It's crazy, I've never done that before. Also, I'm almost completely blind. My vision as if I'm looking through a microscope. I feel me losing myself almost completely now. In case this is my last diary to you guys, all I can do is pray. Dear God, please help me fight this demon. Please give me the strength and courage to go through this. I'm sorry for messing with the Ouija board and I pray for your forgiveness. I know I have sinned and if I must sacrifice my soul in order for redemption then so be it. Amen. Just in case this is my last rite, I just wanna say, Esmy, thank you for your good memories and your friendship. I love you like a sister. Dante, I love you and I'm sorry if I hurt you. I never meant to hurt you. Mom, Dad, I love you so much and I miss you. Aunt Peggy I love you. Everyone who's watching, thank you. You helped me through this. Goodbye. (REBECCA SOBBING) (RUSHING WINDS) (REBECCA GASPING) (REBECCA SCREAMING) Help! Help me! Help me! He's here! Help me! Help me! Help me! (OMINOUS HUMMING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Rebecca. Are you here? I'm back. Rebecca. Are you still in bed? Get up you lazy bum, it's your birthday. Rebecca, come on, get up. I wanna tell you about my trip. Rebecca. Whoa! Did you and Dante have a wild night last night or what? Becky. Rebecca are you okay? (ESMY SCREAMING) Oh my God! Oh my God. Oh my God. 9-1-1! I need someone! I think my roommates dead! I don't know what happened! I don't know! She's not moving or breathing! She's got these things all over her face! I need someone here right now! Please, somebody get here! (ESMY GASPING) (CAMERA CLICKING) (FAINT DISPATCH SPEAKING) MALE: I think they said the body's in here. Body's in here detective. Yeah. Oh Jesus. What happened to her face? Looks like, looks like post mortem discoloration. If I had to take a guess, I would say she was strangled to death. Have you ever seen a dead person with veins pop like that? No, that's pretty peculiar right there. I think we're gonna have to have the coroner help us out on this one to be honest. Rosa, when we're done would you mind taking some closeups around her neck? On top of it. (CAMERA CLICKING) Alex, get two paper bags on her hands please? You got it. And Rosa, let's get some pictures of the hands as well. ROSA: Got it. Oh fuck! (OMINOUS MUSIC) It's just a cadaveric spasm. It's just a muscle spasm. It's nothing to worry about, it's not uncommon. But, step this way. There's something I'd like to show you. Got ourselves a web cam here. Whoa. Look at that, it's still on. I wonder if the killer was stupid enough though to record himself in the middle of the act. Bingo. Well smile, you're on camera. Look, there's a chat going on as well. Oh yeah. And it's still going. That's interesting. Yeah. Okay, well let's take it back to the station. No, you go ahead downstairs, I'll meet you. Alright. I'll wrap this up. Yeah, just figure this out, let's see. Ah, turn it off. Hi, my name is Dante. I was Rebecca's boyfriend. I just want to get you up to speed on things. It's been a few days since Rebecca died. I'm sorry, I feel so silly doing this. I'm doing this only because I'm fond of her. Well actually because the cops found it and gave it to me. I guess I'll read the rest of what it says. And it reads: "Dear Diary, if you are reading this "it means that I am dead "and I didn't survive the possession. "The myths about demonic possession can be put to rest now. "If the proof that you haven't seen make you believe, "then I don't know what to tell you. "Priests need to take this exorcism seriously "and people need to realize that demonic "possession is alive and well "and can happen to anybody who unleashes "the dark side by messing with the instrument "of evil known as the Ouija board. "If I can't make people believe, "then hopefully I can save lives by letting people know "and leaving the decision up to them "to believe or not. "Hopefully I can stop this from happening "to anyone else like it has happened to me." Rebecca. Rebecca. Wherever you are, just know you're truly missed. You were the best girlfriend I ever had. Goodbye. (DANTE CRYING) (DANTE LAUGHING) I have it. Mission accomplished. I have served my master right. He has rewarded me handsomely. Not bad huh? There's some people doing this too. As you all know, I don't do the killings. I just convince foolish girls to do this. I gave Andrew $100 for this. Money talks baby. Everybody has a price in their heads. You guys wanna see something cool before I leave? Well just like in the movies, you guys are in for a treat. Check this out. (DANTE GRUNTS) (DEEP WHINING) (SLOW PACED MUSIC)
