- Hi Mom! Can't talk too long, I'm on my way to an audition. I'm in a hurry. What's up? - OK, we can talk later. - OK, call you later, bye! - OK, we'll try it like this. - Yup, it's perfect, thanks. - Hi! I'm Maria. - And I'm Yves. - Jacques. - Yves Jacques, yes, that's it. - Hey, could it be that I've seen you before like in a commercial or something? - When your stomach is acting up... - You OK, Roxane? - Yes, yes, sorry. - ... don't put up with embarrassing gurgles and constipation. Reach for Fibre Fibre Fibre. - You good? - Much better. - Ah! - With Fibre Fibre Fibre, you go fast, fast, fast! - My greatest part, the only one, no audition... - Of course, absolutely. Cool, so let's do a first take. OK, ready in 3, 2, 1, action. - Your mother's worried, Mathilde. - Ah, sorry, it's just... it's just that I was waiting for “call her”, sorry. - But “call her”, that's later in the script, no? - Yes, it's a little farther, yeah. - Ah, my mistake. - That's all right. It happens. Don't worry about it sweety. - He said “sweety”. - No worries, let's do it again in 3, 2, 1, action. - Mathilde, your mom's worried. - Dad, stop. You know she should be the one calling me. - I know, but you're my daughter. And I love you. - I love you too. - Hey Maria, do you think you could, when you say that, make it so we feel it a little bit more, you know, that you really, love him? - OK. - Cool, perfect. We're just trying something, let’s try it. - OK. - Cool. - Yes, but you're my daughter and I love you. - I love you too, dad! - Cool, I didn't hate it, it was cool... there was something cool about it. Maybe the volume could be just a little lower, I think. So, let's try this again in 3, 2, 1, action. - Yes, but you're my daughter and I love you. - I love you too, dad. - Alright, cool, that'll be all, thanks. - Huh no, we're not done. - Yes, I think... I think that's enough. - Maybe just one last one? - Come over here. Look, why do you want to become an actress? - Ah! I don't want to be an actress, I need money. - Look, us actors, we're all broke. It's not like we drive BMW, or something. Find something you enjoy doing, and do that, huh? - I was that crappy? - That's a little crude, but yeah, you were pretty crappy. Like hangover crap. That bad. - OK. - It was crappy. - Why do you toke up in the morning? It's disgusting! - You hungry? I can make you eggs, toast, ravioli. Oh! Ravioli on toast! - You can't always blame the munchies on your cancer every day of your life, you're pushing it a bit. - With what little time I have left, I can push it all I want. - What time is your appointment? I'll go with you. - It was this morning. - Oh, shit! Sorry. How did it go? - They're giving me 15 minutes to live. - Stop. - I'm waiting for the results. - You scared? - I know I'm going to die, we just don’t know when. - Hum! - Maria, we have to talk, OK? - Go ahead. Talk to me. - What are you planning to do with your life? - To live here right up until you die, and then after, to live with your ghost until I die. - Exactly, let's talk about the house. - Oh no, no, no, no, no! You promised me you wouldn't sell it. - I don't have a choice, Maria. - I'll buy it, then! - You don't have a job. And I don't have money, just debts. I don't want to worry about you. I only have what I need to roll-up a few joints. otherwise, nothing. - I'll find a job. - Maria, I can't believe you spent the whole $100,000 you got from Fibre Fibre Fibre. It could have changed your life, you know? - I'll recoup, don't worry. - You sound just like your father. - Really? You know who he is? - No, but all the men I slept with back then could have said the same thing. - See? Yesterday, I had an audition. - You did? And? - I didn't get it. - That's why I need to sell the house. - Don't worry, I'll find me a classy job. - You have a degree in communication that's in the garbage. - I really don't feel like communicating. - Oh no, Maria! You're doing nothing with your life! Look at you! Look at you! You escape the conversation. - The word is “avoid” - Stop worrying, I'll find work! I was just taking a little break. - A break from what, Maria? From watching series while eating corndogs? - Hey, I don't watch that many series. I don't know, I just don't feel like doing a boring job once again, a normal job. I think I’m special... - Stop thinking you're special and get a job, something you're not totally crappy at. Ask a career coach for help. - Maybe we should ask career coaches to find coaches to coach them. - Ah, you could apply for a job in a drugstore. - Ah! - Hey, it's important work. You could arrange sanitary napkins by order of flow. - Normal jobs are not for me! Remember when your friend tried to get me in at his office? Yes, hello! This is Maria from Bustos, Bustos, &amp; associates. - Not interested. - Great, me neither. - Oh! Excuse me, Lady Diana. - Jobs like that are just not for me! I tried at the ice cream place. - It looks like a pile of shit. - You are what you eat, apparently. - If at least that one hadn't been for your boss. - I want to find a job that'll make me feel good, that'll give me a sense of value. - Go back to flipping burgers, they were pretty good. - Yeesh! No, I don't think they want to see me again. Hello, Mr. Gendron, yes. Did you say “turn off the fryer” or “I’ll turn off the fryer”? - Hey! You could become a teacher. Just this morning I saw in the newspaper There’s a great shortage of teachers. They're even asking retirees to come back to replace the ones who are having burnouts. - Hey, that really sounds like a fun job. I can't anyway, I don't have a teaching degree. - You don't need one to be a substitute teacher. - I love it! Where do I apply? - On the school commission's website. If you don't have a record and you're clean, you should be all right. Get yourself sorted out so I can go in peace. - Mom, I love you. - Me too, like just OK. - So now what? I go visit some schools and poof, I become a teacher? Hey! What are you doing? I could be your mother! - Don't talk about my mom, man! - OK, I could be your father! - Yo! My dad is dead! - OK, and I never knew mine. We're in the same boat. Let go my bag! Pull up your pants and go read a book! - Come on! Christ! What is this place! For god’s sake! - The Church has evolved, young lady. We're hip and the kids are hop. Our rockstar is God. You'll see, this is heaven at a time when humanity is lost. Fear no more, we need young people like you. - Ah, that's what I'm here for. - Ah! You inspire goodness and trust, which are helpful for teaching youth. - WOW! That’s pretty as hell! - Here we aim for achievement through achieving. Students have no outside stimuli. No music during school hours, no Kanye West, no flashy colours on their nails or their face, no whining, no complaining, no loitering and no swearing otherwise they get suspended. Teachers are expected to set an example through authority, punishment, and extracurricular activities, meant for learning rather than entertaining. If they want entertainment, they can find it in the street, huh? This is not a place to play, it's a place to succeed. Teachers are not allowed to use their phone during courses and there's an area reserved for technology in the school yard. You are not a number, but rather an example. If you want a coffee, you buy it. We're not a Starbucks. And of course, smoking is prohibited on school property. this is not a place to wait for death, it's a clean and healthy place. I hope I've been clear. Do you have any questions? - Yes! Can I leave now? - Absolutely. - OK! Crazy bitch! Ha! Fucking ugly deadbeat town! Crappy weather! It's grey, it's cold! I'm fed up with this fucking shitty life, shitty town, shitty people with everybody! Come on! People aren't working! You better wait, it's my turn you fucking moron! What does she want? What do you want? - If you don't get here, I'm going to kill someone. - Yeah, yeah,I'm coming. I'm almost there. - Move your ass, you're going to miss the reveal. - How much does it excite people to know the baby's gender, seriously? I've been driving around for 20 minutes looking for a parking space in Blainville. Look, give me the time to walk Compostel, I'm there. - OK, fine then, bye. - Bye. - Auntie! - Jordan! - I told you a million times, my name is Emile. - Yes, but you look more like a Jordan. - Mom told me you had a big audition for TV. You'll get it, I'm sure! - Do you think I'd get caught if I started trafficking kids? - 100%. - Give me your friends' phone numbers and I'll take care of the rest. - Good thing you're here. You almost got to help us decorate. I was sure you'd choke. - Come on, I would never choke on this. - You didn't come to Edouard's. - I must have felt I wouldn't like him much. - He's not my favourite, either. Guys! Stop that! - Maria, hello! Darling, where is, the quinoa salad? - In the washer. - What? - No, no behind the bar, in the fridge. Mental charge, Joe, come on. - It's not there. - Crap, I forgot to make it. - Oh! It doesn't matter, there's plenty of chips and everyone only pretends to like it. - Hey! My quinoa salad is really good! - Of course. - You won't judge me if there's no quinoa salad? - I judge you for a lot of things, but I don't give a crap about your quinoa salad. - Edouard! Put down that knife if you want to keep seeing the light of day! - I'll take care of it. - Thanks. - Edouard, you're too young to want to put an end to your life. Do you want to end up at the hospital? - Yes! - OK, they'll put tubes in your arm. If you cut yourself, you won't be able to play hockey anymore. Ah! I should have let him cut himself. - Hello! - Hello, Sandrine! - Ah! I love gender reveal parties! Usually, it happens a little earlier, in the pregnancy, but it's fine. I'm the one who organized it. You know, I used to be a party girl. But now, for a little fun, this is what I do. It's joyful, you know, and it avoids awkward mornings with some random guy you brought back from the bar. - Isn't that how you met your boyfriend? - You, what have you been up to? - I've been interviewing to be a teacher. - Wow! - It's OK. Hello, Mom! - Hello, hello girls! - How are you? - I'd be better if I had something to drink. - Oh! Oh, oh! Would you like a little mocktail? - What's that? - A cocktail with no alcohol. - Oh! I think I'll pass. because Raph needs my help, she's been calling me for a while. - I didn't hear anything. - Yeah, yeah, Raph, I'm coming! Here I am! - What? - I'm walking towards you! - I'm the one who organized this. - Hey guys, I have to talk to you. - Why are you whispering? There's no one here. - On the 28th, I'm proposing to Raphaëlle. But don't tell her. - Oh, wow! - You have 2 kids, she's not going anywhere. - Will you be there? I would really love it if you were there. - I'll have to check my calendar. - Hey! You never have anything to do. Good try. - There will be some pigs in a blanket. - Alright, alright, I'll be there the day before. - Come on, drop that, let's go. - I can't fucking wait! - Mmm! - You OK? - My pregnancy is driving me nuts. Either I'm dead on my feet, or I want to fuck, I don't know. - My God! Did she say “fuck”? - She said “fuck”. - I so hope it's a girl, I'm so fed up with washing penises! Please! - Ah! Our lives are so different. So what are you going to call this one? - Macarena. - OK, really? - Yes. - She's going to get bullied. - By us! Hey, macarena! Ay! OK, but if it's a boy? - If it's a boy, she'll call him Bomba! - Could I have your attention, please. Don't be afraid, I won't eat you. - He's not a good public speaker! - Unless you ask me to, then I might just take a bite! - You leave me alone with Sandrine again, and I kill you. - Friends, family, thank you for being here with us to celebrate the arrival of our third child, the living proof of our incredible fertility. - OK. So thanks for being here we'll now cut the cake. - If it's pink inside, it's a little girl, a princess. - And if it's blue, it's a boy. Another one. - It's purple! So what's purple? It's... - Yes, it's... Ha, ha! So what's purple? It's... What? What's purple? What does it mean, when it's purple? Nobody knows? What's purple, for Christ's sake? What's purple? Call the doctor! What's purple? Mom, what's purple? - It probably means it’s a girl. - Freaking trends... It's a trans. - Idiot! - They say hermaphrodite when it's both sexes. And I'll love my child whatever it is! - A little faggot. - Hey! Another crack like that and you're out! What's purple? It must be a shade of pink. I can't believe it. - Purple is really a mix of red and blue. It’s more likely a boy than a girl. - Hey, nobody asked you. - I think the best solution would be to call the bakery, huh? - I just did, there's no answer. - OK, so we'll play a game. - Yes! We'll play a game. Get the fuck out of here! - OK, woah everyone! let's calm down, let's take a deep breath, chill. I'll get in my car, and drive to the bakery and they'll give us an answer, good? - I'm going with you. - Yes, go ahead, honey. We'll take care of the rest. - I wanted to unwrap the gifts. - Go to hell! - I'll come with you too. - I don't want to stay here all by myself. - Let's all go. - Oh no, oh no, oh no! - Come on! - There's someone, there's someone there! Excuse me, it's an emergency! - We're closed. - No! You can't be closed! You're not closed now! - My God, she really takes business hours seriously. - It’s my mother... she passed away this morning. - Oh! I'm so sorry, it's just that my boyfriend ordered a cake to reveal the baby's gender, but it's purple, it must be a mistake, but you have the paper that says which gender it is. I need to know! - My mom was old, but she wasn't stupid. It's not a mistake. Purple is for twins. It's a boy and a girl. - A girl. - Ah! It would have been more obvious if the cake had been marbled, I think. - Are you happy? - A girl! - Yes! - But twins, I want to die! They'll break my vagina! - At least you'll be able to call them Macarena and Bomba. - Sure, or you can save time and call them Dance Mix 98. - I'm so sorry about your mother. - At least she died doing something she loved. - Stuffing cannolis. You have the keys to my car. Let's go. - No point in running, you have to leave on time. - Really! - Babies! Two of them! - Yes, yes, two. - Two! - Yes, this message is for Maria. This is the secretary at Bois des Fleurs College. I'm calling to confirm your interview with our principal at 9:30 a.m., thank you. - Coffee? - Please. - With or without GHB? - Ha! Without, thanks. - You're boring. So, Maria, who are you? Where are you from? Why are you here? Is everything ok in there? - I've always wanted to inspire young people and give them a thirst for learning. - OK, now give me the real answer. - I'm trying to find myself. - Do you have experience? - In teaching? - No, in pottery. - Huh... - Joke. My God, joke! But seriously, it's not easy here. In fact, teaching, in general, isn't easy, because you have to manage a bunch of other things in addition to teaching. You understand? - I understand. - If you get that, you'll be great. Actually, it's not rocket science. There are 3 golden rules. Do you know them? Rule no. 1: no swearing allowed, unless it's Friday. Rule no. 2: no smoking in the class, unless there's a fire. And rule no.3: you can't hit anyone. - Duly noted. - You'll definitely feel like it, we can talk about it later. - I have a question. - No, it's not tobacco. It's THC for my arthritis. I'll give you a Grade 8 class, international, always the same gang. Do you know what that is? - No. - Great, they're a bunch of smart kids. Sometimes they're smart asses, but they're very good. You won't have any trouble. - But I've never done that, I don't know how it works. Do I have a program or did someone leave me something to do? - Listen... Good! We have to go that's second period. - What do I do? Jesus Christ! Is there a course plan? Is it the exam period? Do I have to correct anything? What do I have to do? - What you have to do? Don't worry. Huh? Like all the other teachers, you do what you can. So now, you're in room 216, you're teaching and you're late. Come on, get moving! - Hi! My name is Maria and I would really like it if you could turn off your phones, please. - Go to hell! - Yes. - Fourth rule: no running away. - I can't do it. I said one sentence and one of them told me to go to hell. - At least you had time to say one sentence. Look, these kids, they're bored at school. Because they're all too smart. You have to keep them motivated, but you must show authority, because otherwise, they'll take over and first thing you know, there's a fire in your top drawer. - What? - Look, forget it. Just show authority, that's all. - Hello again! My name is Maria and I'm substituting for Mrs... Mrs... Mrs... I'm replacing a Mrs. - Excuse me. There's only one "F". - First warning. - But I didn't do anything. - Second warning. - What happens at three? - I'll flunk you. - Really! - We're all gifted students. If someone flunks in here, you'll look like the incompetent one. - If you continue like this, you'll get a first warning. - I'm going to call my mother, first warning. - Your mother... I eat your mother for breakfast. Put your phone away. I said put it away, not turn it over. And if you keep this up, you get a first warning. - When Gabriela gets warnings, I guess we're really in deep shit. - Ah! You, put your phone away or I'll make you eat it. - Woah! You're even worse than Mrs. Hurteau! - And you have 2 warnings now. - Do we get a warning the minute we talk? - It depends if I like your tone. - That's pretty subjective, I don't see how... - That tone, I don't like it. Second warning. OK then! Now that I have your attention, my name is Maria, I'm substituting for your teacher, Mrs. Hurteau, like he said, and I would like you to take turns introducing yourselves. You'll tell me what you would like to be in the future and your favourite animal. - Really, this isn't kindergarden. - Hey, you, looks like you want to talk. You start. - My name is Gabriela. My favourite animal is the unicorn. - That's not even a real animal. - And I want to be a star. - That's not even a real job. Jesus Christ, I didn't know you could have the wrong answers to these questions. Miss. - I'm Bethesda, I want to be a veterinary. And my favourite animal is... - a cow. A fucking fat cow. - You, shut up. - Oh! - What's your name? - Elliot, and I want to be a basketball player. - You're much too short! And what position will you play? The ball? OK, you all stop that now. - OK, maybe I'm too small to play basketball, but at least I don't make spelling mistakes on the board. - I want to resign. - I'm refusing to accept your resignation. - I told a kid he was too little. - Good thing you didn't call him a little prick. - I got 3 days training, to work in an ice cream shop. We talked for 15 minutes before my shift, I'm not ready. - No one is ever ready. Just pretend you know what you're doing. You know, kids are just like horses, you can't let them feel your fear, otherwise they'll go crazy. You see this? These are horse riding trophies. - You do horse riding? - No, I got them at a thrift shop. But I like that people think I ride horses. You see, it worked. - Not really, no. - Look, pretend like know what you're doing, you'll be OK. - Thanks for believing in me. - I don't have a choice, we're in deep shit. So now, you'll convince yourself that you're a math teacher. - No, no, not math. - Ah yes, yes, math. - I passed my 416 by cheating. I still count with my fingers. - Look, give them exercises and tell them to do them in silence. - And if they ask me questions? - Ride a horse. - What? - Pretend you know what you're doing! You're dismissed. Go! - Move over! OK, I'm substituting today, but it's the last time. Stop calling me. I'm telling you, I'm not coming back! - Anybody can change their minds! Look, you're here today! - OK, but after today, I want you to promise me you'll forget about me. Edith, Edith, I'm retired. I don't want to work, it's over! - I thought you were passionate... - About geography. I'm passionate about geography. I'm passionate about sharing knowledge, but spending my days trying to drive a subject matter into the head of a bunch of teenagers who are so oblivious they're not even able to identify Canada on a map of Canada, That, I'm not passionate about! Repeating “turn off your phones” 50 times a day is not something I'm passionate about! Parents, parents who think it's not fair that their child fails at school when said child spent the whole school year dragging their ass instead of doing the work, is not something I'm passionate about! I don't have a passion for explaining that the problem, might not be the system, but their darling child who has always been allowed to do anything because their parents, at the end of the day, when they get home, are too burnt out to face reality, that they're raised... a shitty human! Oh! No, no, no, no, I'm not passionate about that, OK? OK! - I forbid you to quit. - She’s an inspiration. - You have a class. Chop, chop! - Yes, Gabriela? - Ma'am, how much time do we have to do the exercise? - Ah, as much as you want. Take your time. As much time as possible. Yes, Simon? - Will it count in our report card? - I think it will, I'm not the one who decides. Yes, Bethesda? - Could you please explain to me what is a rational equation? - Does someone want to explain to Bethesda what is a rational equation? - You don't know? Man, they really let just anyone substitute. - Yes, but they still rejected your mother. Yes, Simon? - A rational equation is an algebra equation in which one of the variables appears once in the fraction's denominator. - That's it. - You didn't even know that. - Excuse me? - You didn't even know. That's why you asked. - Huh, you didn't either. - What do you mean? I just gave the answer. - No, you checked on your phone. - No. - I asked you to explain to Bethesda what is, a rational equation, because it was a test, I wanted to test you, so that you could assimilate comprehension of the subject. - What I'm assimilating, is that you don't know what you're talking about. - Two. - What? - Seven. - Huh? - 18. - What about 18? - Square root. - Come with me. So this is where the magic happens. - The magic... in the sense that everyone looks like they want to disappear? That guy there, is he dead? - No. That's the pot we confiscate from the students. You can take some, but leave some for the others. Everyone, This is Maria, she's been a substitute teacher since 8 this morning and she already feels like killing. - Hi, Maria. - Hello! - Do you want some coffee? It's not very good. - No, thank you. - You OK, Maryse? - No. I almost sat on a thumb tack again. Third time this month. At least this time, my tetanus shot is up to date. - Here you go, Maryse, take some, it'll do you good. - I'm smelling a burnout. - That's a common smell here, huh? - Hey, Mom! How are you? - I'm fine. - What are you up to? - I was watching TV, The Golden Goose Game Show. - Good! - How did your first day go? - Good, good. I think I'm starting to like it more and more. But I'm not good at it. - Don't say that. - But it's... it's cool. I'm meeting up with the girls, we're going out for drinks. - Say hi to the girls for me, OK? - OK, Mom. Don't wait up for me, I'll be coming home late. - You know, just because we spent the night together doesn't mean we have to have breakfast together. - Then, she starts whining because I have natural peanut butter. - It does taste like dirt. So my first day really went well. I felt like a true champion. - I think I'm going to leave Joe. - Well, he sort of marked his territory. - No, but I'm serious. - OK, OK. - I told you she didn't love him anymore. Managing a class full of teens, it is a bit difficult... - He's the love of my life, but at the same time, how can I tell? I've never known any other men. - So really, what's the problem? Stop freaking out. - You can't even have a woman over for breakfast. Even if you make her some toast, she won't think you're a couple. - It's obvious you're not a lesbian. - It would do you good to do something other than work. - But I love to work. - Good for you, Laura. I think my new job is going to do me good, you'll see, I'm going to be a new... - Hey! You've told us 3 times already, Maybe you could listen to your friend for 3 minutes. Today I made a dog vomit the string from a roast he ate, do I tell you about it? - Well huh... - She's right, you don't listen. You've never listened. - Hello! I'm Maria! - And I'm... - Hi! I'm Maria! - I'm Raphaëlle. - So? You see? That's why we've been friends for so long. - Maybe being stuck in the same class for 13 years helped a little bit. - I would say we became friends in spite of it. - My favourite animal is the horse. The horse... - My mother once had a horse, his name was Nafkha. - OK, that's enough everyone. Maria, thank you. Go ahead, Raphaëlle. - Horses have a gestation period of... - It means “fart” in Arabic because he was an old horse and he was always farting. - Ever since that day, I've hated horses. - We were just kids. - Ah, that's cute. You're speaking in the past tense. - You were like that as a teen, too. - What's going on? - Joe just left her. - He told me he was into some other girl. - That asshole! - But at least you've had a boyfriend. - Marie, now's not the time. - What? You've French kissed. Me, the only time I had a French kiss, I was a dare in Truth or Dare. - Ah for real, shut the fuck up! - Come to think of it, he left me for you, you cow! - You were already secretly eating vaginas then. - Maria! - What? Everyone here knows that she's a dyke. She keeps coming here to hook up with girls. Guys, I finally have something I like, I have a new job! For once I have something fun to talk about. - Yeah, the problem is you do the same thing when you don't have a new job. - Oh boy! First of all, you don't know how to play pool. Second of all, forget about her, I'm still happy that you found something. - Thanks. - Yeah, it's creepy, a 30-year-old who does nothing. Ah! It's my nightmare, I think. - That's because you date your job. - OK, I admit I'm not a very good listener, OK? But it's the first time in my whole life that I'm feeling really happy. - You're not exaggerating you know. - OK well I'm calling it a night. I have to get up early tomorrow, I'm shopping for urns with my mom because she's sick, she's dying, she has cancer. I don't know if you recall, but anyway, you probably don't, because I'm not allowed to talk about that either. - That's not what we said! - Bye! - Maria! Wait! Oh! For real, if you leave me here to kiss someone, I'll kill you. - But I never do that. - Mom? - It's me... your mother! - What are you doing? - Practising for when I'm dead. - It's late. Go to bed. - Oh, I already took a nap. - Ah, of course, your midnight nap, huh? Want some? - Ah, thank you for sharing my own pot. - My pleasure! You OK? - Bah, I ache all over, but since I'm buzzed out of my mind, I'm OK. - Anything I can do? - You want to do something for me? Help yourself, that would help me. There's a pile of bills bigger than your ass that's waiting for you. - Ah, my ass must be ginormous then. It's all good now. I'll be retiring soon. - Stop fooling around Maria. When you came to live here, it was for a few days. - Yeah, and now it's been, what, 4 years? - I won't be able to take care of you when I'm gone. - That's why I'll live off my inheritance. It's going to be all right, don't worry. - I once took a class in teaching. I wanted to be a teacher, but I kept thinking: "Oh, you're no good, you're not interesting." I put it all off to later, but then, you were born, and then I told myself: "Doesn't matter, one day, I will..." Oh! I love you very much... but stop screwing things up! Good night... - Hello! - Good morning. - I would like a latte, please. - A latte? You're in a public school cafeteria here. Do I look like a baritone? - It's barista. - It's shut up. - I'll take a regular coffee then. That's all. - Yes. - It wasn't a question, that's all. Fucking cow! - Yuck! Hi! Go out with me on Sunday! Hi! Hey, calm down. Hi! Ah, that's pretty lame. - You're talking to yourself now? - No, no. - Yes. - It's because I want to ask a girl on a date. - Ooh! Sorry. I don't know what got into me. Who is it? - None of your business. - Show a little respect, I'm your teacher. - It's none of your business, ma’am. - You're no fun. - I don't want to talk about my crush with a teacher. - Come on! - She's really smart, she's cool. Some kids say she's a fatty. But I think she's perfect. - Oh no! Listen, I'm really touched, but you can't crush on me, I'm your teacher. But if I was your age... - Yuck! No, it's not you! - If I was your age, I would kick your ass. - No, but yuck, you're a grown woman, is what I mean. - Ouch! So who is it? Bethesda? - How did you know? - You always have a stiffy when you look at her. Huh, forget it. - Huh... - Let me give you some advice. Just be nice, but not a doormat. Be tender, but not mushy. Be funny, but not a dickhead. - It's pretty complicated. - Right, and that's why I'm totally alone. Alone, all by my lonesome. So come on, we're going to be late. Let's go. OK! Gabriela Alvarez? - I'm here. - You're comfortable in that bathing suit? - Yeah, why? - No, no, no, just inquiring. It's just that we can see a few cracks, but you know. - I'm used to it. - Ah, you're used to it? Sorry, I'm an idiot, old habits. Please stop rolling, those pretty eyes Elliot Bernard-Grandbois? - Absent. - Bethesda Caron? Bethesda? So where's Bethesda? I thought I saw her earlier. - She just realized she's a big fat cow. - Simon, would you please start stretching? And no one in the water. It's dangerous, there's no lifeguard. Except for Elliot, you can go in the water, drown, do what you want, I don't care. Bethesda? Bethesda, where are you? Bethesda? Where are you? Come on, show yourself! I'll nip at your heels if you don't come out. Oooh! Ooh, yuck, you don't have flip flops, there's all kinds of bad stuff on the floor. - There's nothing on the floor. - Why aren't you in class? - Everyone laughs at me. - OK, but what do we care about them, you have to come to class. - I'm staying here. You can flunk me, I don't care. - I know you don't care, nobody here cares about anything anyway. - I don't want to come out. - OK, if you don't come out, I'm calling the cops. Hee hee hee! You knew I wouldn't really call the cops huh? Huh-huh! Nope, you're staying here. Why aren't you coming to class? - Everybody calls me fatty. - And do you think, you're fat? OK. - Are you a pedophile? - Shush! What are you talking about? Of course not! I just want to show you that I'm not thin either. - It's true, you do have a belly. - Sure, I have a belly and I'm fine with it. - Yeah, but you're not fat. And you're an adult, you have a lot more self-confidence than I do. - OK, I'm not quite an adult, and yes, you're a little round and you look like the sun in Teletubbies in your nice little yellow suit, but you're still pretty and we don't give a crap because nobody's ever happy anyway. Do you like to swim? - At home, yeah. - Imagine enjoying swimming anywhere. - I guess it would be fun. - It would, wouldn't it? Can you imagine not doing anything you enjoy doing because of a little moron like Elliot? - I think you're not allowed to call him a moron. - I know, but you won't snitch on me, huh? - Never. - Look, you might not have control on your appearance, but you have control on whether you accept what people say or not. Look at me, you're beautiful. And you can be fat and beautiful at the same time. And besides, you know there's going to be people who'll say you're too fat, you're too skinny, you're too tall, you're too small. Who cares! We don't give a damn! You have 2 choices: you let them get to you, you're unhappy and you let life pass you by, or you come with me and you move forward. You literally plow through them. Good! That's the smile I wanted to see again! Come on, follow me and fuck them all! - Ma'am? - What? - You're pretty cool. - No. I'm chubby. Onward! Let's get on board! We'll show them who's the captain here! I pee in the water. But don't tell anyone, OK? It's our little secret. So, is everyone fully warmed up? - Hey everyone, it's the big Bethes-stump! - What did you say, Ellishito? - Hey, you're not allowed to make fun of me. - Oh, sorry, we can't hear you, there's too much echo, Ellifuck. All right, everyone in the pool, and swim a few lengths to warm up. - Watch out, Bethesda is going in the water, the pool might overflow. There won't be enough space for everyone! - Good thing this will be compensated, by the fact that you have a really small penis. - OK, but at least I've seen one. - You, maybe, but not many girls can find it to see it. - Woah, woah! Two seconds. Booger jokes are OK poop jokes can be OK too, but jokes about small penises, no way, and neither are jokes about fat people. And jokes about fat people with small penises are the worst. So please, stay away from these 2 topics, they're really disrespectful. Do you understand me? Do you understand? You can continue sparring. - You were saying? - That I can't even see my vagina because of my belly, but you, no one can find your penis, even with a microscope. - That's a no-no. - Hey, fuck you! - I'd love to, but I can't see your penis. - OK, woah! The size of a penis doesn't matter. Not that I'm saying you have a small penis, and I don't want to know the size of your penis, Elliot. But could you just leave each other be and just like each other as you are? Please. - Hey, Elliot, I found your penis, it was in the drain. - Bethesda, no! - Get dressed. I don't argue with people in their bathing suit. You're not allowed to bully students. - And you're not allowed to smoke indoors. - True. Get out. You did nothing, you saw nothing. - I'm not getting punished? Ellishito - that's a good one! I'd never heard that one before! This is what Edith, the woman, would like to say to you. Now, for the principal. What's your fucking problem? Now, this is me talking. What is this? You think teaching is a joke, is that it? Do you realize you're not in their class. You're their teacher. - I'm sorry. - I think you have potential, but no fucking willpower. Work on that. So that being said, I have to thank you. - What? Are you firing me? - No, I have to thank you for listening to me. - Edith, I'm fed up of watching them being awful to each other all day long and nobody does anything about it. - Let them defend themselves, that's how they'll learn. - If I let them bully each other like that, they will become crappy adults. - Look, it's cool what you're doing with Bethesda, but you can't start bullying them too. You have to manage shit, not provoke it. - I understand. - Two years ago, I went to Thailand. Beautiful trip, oh! Great food, fun in the sun, Christ, did I ever enjoy it! - What are you getting at? - Well, hello, Thailand. A country that's dirt poor, and I had lots of fun. - OK. - So, despite a hostile environment, there's always a way to have fun by staying positive. - So what you're saying, is that if there's people around you who are hurting, if you smile, nobody's suffering anymore. So basically, your expertise is denial. - You're making me sound like an idiot and I don't love it. - I'm sorry. - Look, what I mean is, if you want to help them, just make sure they stay in school. And to do that, you have to make them like school. - That's really deep. - All right so, now it's time to meet with the parents. That, I promise, will really make you want to get the hell off to Thailand! - What? That's tonight? - It's right now. - What are you doing? You OK? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Listen, if it’s about what happened at the pool, Elliot... - No, that's not it. Just leave me alone. - OK, have a nice day. - My kitchen is closed. - You close at 6, come on. - No, if no one's here I can close early. - But I'm here. - That's what I said. There's no one. - Come on, it's an emergency. - Really? Are you having a stroke? Because that would be an emergency, otherwise it doesn't count. - I know your work mustn't always be easy, and the kids are probably mean to you, but I really believe that there's a good person behind that grumpy face. And I think you deserve to be treated with kindness. Thank you, dear. Hi, come in, come in! Please take a seat! Would you like a sandwich? - No thank you. We're Elliot's parents, Elliot Bernard-Grandbois. - Or, as you called him, Ellishito. Bravo. I haven't heard anything positive about you. - That's great because I don't have much to say that's positive about Elliot either. - We were worried about sending our child to public school. - Very worried. - With everything you hear. - Life is a jungle for kids today. Every day we're afraid for our little Simon. - Don't worry, your boy is so nice, he's kind, he's considerate, he has a crush on the fat girl in the group. - Pardon me? - Yes, sir. - I don't have a choice, I have to stay, my grandma doesn't speak the language. - OK. So Gabriela is a very lovable girl, but she talks a lot during class. Gabriela is a very friendly girl and an almost perfect student! - Often, during class, she disturbs others and that affects her grades. I'm really impressed with her grades - Listen, things aren't great at home, but Elliot still is a good kid, huh? He washes his own dishes. - Not here. He disturbs class, he doesn't pay attention, he insults the other students, he drags his ass... Ah, sorry, his bottom. I'm very concerned about his future. - Teachers and their little boxes. You're really all the same. - We don't believe in discipline we believe in self-discipline. - Oh boy! You need to have a conversation with him. - A conversation about...? - Sex, Hélène. No, we don't want to talk about that. - We don't even talk about it between us. - You won't have a choice if you don't want him to turn his attention to something else. - That's what we want. - Not something other than sex. Some other way to find out about sex, like porn for instance. You wouldn't want porn to answer his questions. - My God, no! - She's not in danger of failing, but it could come to that if she continues to spend all her time in class on her cell phone. I believe she deserves an award for her impeccable behaviour and outstanding grades! your granddaughter is a liar and I understood everything she told you We can speak directly in Spanish, you and I. You should be ashamed! We'll talk about this at home! Don't worry, I'll deal with her. You, shut your mouth. Gabriela, let's go. Serves you right. - You're going to have to talk to him, Serge. - I'm not comfortable doing this. - Will you be comfortable when you walk into his room and see a dildo the size of a fist on his bed because he thinks fisting is a basic move? - Fis... - Fisting, Hélène. - Emile! Cripes! Not again! Sorry, it's a fucking mess here. - No stress, it's always a fucking mess. - I don't think she's in the mood for your wisecracks. Oh, oh, oh! Speaking of wisecracks. Looks like Edouard has a little plan. - What's he doing? No! Mommy, said no. No, it's not nice for the pool. Hey! Sorry. - Here, Maria. - Oh, thanks sweetie! It's beautiful! - Why do you laugh? - Because it looks like a vulva. - A what? - No, it's very pretty. - Of course you would find that pretty. - Moron! - It's a rose, I really love roses. It reminds me of you. - That's very nice. But let's keep your drawing away from auntie Laura because otherwise, she might just eat it! - You know he's only five? - Yes, and it's the right age to explain to him that his rose looks like a 93-year-old's not too tight vulva. - You'd better never have a kid. Emile, would you please draw a rose for me too? - Yes, draw a rose for auntie Laura, she hasn't seen one in a while, she misses it. - She misses seeing a rose? - Yes, exactly. - Go ahead, and don't forget the labia majora, I mean the petals. - Ah, really! - I love you, little man! - Ah, Lolo, I wanted to ask, I'd like to go out, to dinner with Joe this weekend, you know, with no kids. Would you mind babysitting? - Ah, huh, you're going to freak out but... I have a date on Saturday. - What! - I’m blown away. - I thought you didn’t date. - I know, but she showed up at work with her dog, and I don't know, we clicked. The magic of vet clinics strikes again. - It's our second date. - Oh no! Oh no, now I'm going to be the lame single friend again. Crap! - Loser! - But I can babysit if you want. - No thanks. - I spend my days running after kids, I can do it, really. - Yeah, I don't know. - Sure, and if anything happens you can call me. - Absolutely, yes. - No, no, I mean when something happens. - OK, no, sorry. Enjoy your date, we'll let Maria babysit, I'll put my trust in her. It's settled, that's what we'll do. - Can I please have your attention please. - OK, but there's just three of us, no need to be so loud. - Raphaëlle, you've been the love of my life for 12 years now and I want to make it official in front of all our loved ones. Raphaëlle Létourneau-Paré... - Raise your leg, get up. - ... would you be my wife? Huh? - We need milk. - What? - There's no milk for the kids. They'll freak out tomorrow, morning we have to go get... We have to go get milk! - Yes, yes, yes, we're out of milk, we're out of... - But we don't need milk now. Raph? Raph? - Raph, what are you doing? - I need air! - Having a smoke wouldn't do? - No. No! Don't get in! I'm too hot or I'm premenopausal. - No, you're pregnant. - You don't want us to come with you? - Yes. No. Just walk beside the car. Ah! My bad... Ah! Again! Freedom! - What are you afraid of? - I don't know, missing out on my own life. - I don't think you're one marriage away from escaping. - No, you have 2 kids and you're expecting twins. - But now you have to decide, we walk, you talk, because it's cold and it's raining. - I abandoned my family! - No, we're 3 houses away, it doesn't count as abandonment. - No, it doesn't even count as a walk. - Do you wanna go back home? - Yes! Because I don't know what I'm doing! - Brake. - I have to brake? - You have to brake now. - That's it. Now turn off the ignition. Turn off the ignition. - Ah! Again! My love! Yes, I do. - Are you sure? - Yes, I panicked, I’m sure. - Can we go now? Hello? Speaking. OK, I'm on my way. I'll always love you Mom. Your memory will make me stronger. I promise you I'll make you proud of me. - You know I'm not dead yet, right? - Yes, I know, I was just practising. - How's school? - Good, but you know how it is, there isn't a lot of people who listen to me so it's just me talking to a wall. - You know, my greatest regret, is dying without having seen you reach your potential. - Mom, let me reassure you, even if you lived to be 1000, you would never see me reaching my full potential. Can you do me a favour? - Depends, if you need a lift, I'm a little bit busy right now. - Will you pray for me when you're in heaven? - Done. - Already? Liar. - I prayed that you would let me rest a bit, OK? - OK. - I'm OK. - OK, it won’t be long. It's not very hard to unroll a condom on a penis and by the way, this size, isn't common. It's a lot easier when the penis is erected, it's a lot faster and less embarrassing, but if it happens, it's not the end of the world. Elliot, get off your phone. Yes, Bethesda? - If the penis stays soft, what do you do? - If it stays soft, you can French you know. Sometimes that, and not freaking out, will make it go hard. - And if the penis breaks, what do you do? - If your penis breaks, Elliot, maybe it's time you stop humping the sofa or your vacuum cleaner. But no, you can't think about this kind of thing. It's the same as if you freaked out every time you get behind the wheel, thinking you're going to get in an accident. Bethesda? - And if the guy doesn't want to hook up? - If the guy doesn't want to hook up with you, listen, you can talk with him. Sometimes sex comes down to if the desire isn't mutual, don't force it. - And how do we know we have a desire? - You, Elliot, you'll have a hard on and Bethesda, you'll get wet. - Yuck! No! - It's not because Bethesda isn't your type that she isn't anyone's type. It's like food, some like chicken, others like sausages. Elliot, get off your phone, it's the second time I'm asking. Hey! - I‘m texting my mom. - Doesn’t your mom know you're in class? Your mom doesn't work? - Yes, she works, it's just that she misses her little boy. - OK, that's not funny, get off your phone. - Two seconds. - Get off it now! - I'm done now. - Hey! What you need to understand about sexual relations, it's that it's fun when both partners really want it. Hey, that's it! - Hey! No, no, no, no, no, no! - I've had it! I'm not letting them screw around with me. Get off your fucking phone! Take this you fucker! - I was quietly smoking my cigarette, hidden behind some bushes, watching the birds poop all over the place, normal life stuff, you know. And then the situation screamed “danger”. - I lost it, I admit it! - You can't just throw a phone like that. - Edith, I can't take it anymore, I feel like I'm repeating the same thing day after day. I ask them to turn off their phones and to open their book. And then, the next day, I get to class, and I get frustrated because they didn't do their homework. And then they whine and I ask them to turn off their phones again. I'm fed up! I'm fed up of repeating the same thing! It feels like every day, it's a new group and I have to start over! I don't teach them, all I do is discipline them! - Look, I think you're just tired. Get some rest. - I'm in top shape. - No one's in top shape when they throw cell phones out the window. - OK, so what do I do? - Get some sleep. You know, when you were in school, when school was over, you'd get home, school was over. These guys, when they get home, school is still on with social media. You know, yeah, they're always on their phone, but you have to know having you calms them, they like you. - You think? - I'm really happy, Maria, you're starting to look like someone who's in the right place. Oh no, don't cry, I hate that. Jesus Christ, hey, no, not a hug. Here you go... and it’s full of love... - Oh, oh! It's plus two, and I have it. Hey! I saw you cheat, you just hid your plus 4 because you know you can't end up with that, huh? - I don't cheat! Stop it, you're just a sore loser! - Woah! You guys stop shouting, please! Or I'm calling social services! - All right, it's 10, go brush your teeth. And if you want, I'll read you a story. - Do we have to shower? - No. - But Mom's going to be upset if she sees we didn't wash our little skin. - Ugh! You're not circumcised? Let me fix that for you. - Ah! Ah! - No,no it's a joke, just a joke. Go brush your teeth. - What's circumcised? - Circumcised, that's when they take the penis and take off the little skin all around it. Jewish people do that, it's cleaner. - Does that mean if there's no more little skin, you don't have to wash it? - Exactly, you still have to wash your peepee, but you won't have to hear your mom shouting: “Did you wash your little skin?” OK, awkward! Go on, go brush your teeth. Hop, hop, hop! Get going! Mr. Emile, upstairs. What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's going on? - Emile wanted to cut off his little skin so he wouldn't have to wash it, like you said and now it's bleeding! - Let me see. Ah! - Edouard, stop that. OK so, Edouard, listen to me. You're going to take a washcloth, and you'll put it on your brother's penis, I'm calling for backup. - Hello! You've reached Raphaëlle. Leave me a message, or not. - Hi, Raph, no stress, but I have a question about your boys. - Emile just cut his penis! Fuck, fuck, fuck! - Not his whole penis, OK, bye. - Hello? - Yes, hello, Laura! Listen, I don't want to bother you during your date, but Emile cut his peepee and I don't know what to do! - What? - I don't want to touch his penis, I'm too uncomfortable! - On my way. - Hey! I handled it like a pro. Turns out it was minor, just a scratch. He did it with a butter knife. He was more scared than anything. Huh, boys? I can't believe this. I'm going to kill you. Are you OK my love? Huh? Everything's OK? - Yes, Auntie, I just didn't want to have to wash my little skin. - Tell me about your date? Is she the love of your life? Do you want something? There's leftover pizza if you're hungry. - OK, guys, go to your room, OK? Go, go, go! I'll go read you a story. - Good night, little ones! - Good night, Maria! - Good night, Maria! - Good night, my darlings! They're so cute! Son of a bitch! Hey if you don't want to go read them a story, that's fine, but no need to be rude. - OK, you call me for an emergency telling me there's blood everywhere. I drop my date like an idiot in full panic mode, I drive even though I'm clearly over the limit. I get here and the kid just has a little scratch on his bat. And you're all OK with this, you offer me pizza and beer, as if I just helped move your washing machine. - I didn't know if you had dinner or not! - It's incredible! You really don't get it! - Woah, chill! - Where is he? Maria, what happened? Speak! - Is he all right? - Of course! - Christ, Maria! I told you so. - Emile! - More fear than pain. He didn't want to wash his little skin! I stopped the bleeding, everything's fine. - And meanwhile, where were you? - On the couch. - He ran off with a knife. How come you didn't see anything? - I'll tell you why you didn't see anything, because you're a selfish bitch, huh? Everything's always funny, nothing's ever important! If it's all good with you, it's all good with everyone! - OK well I think maybe we should talk about this tomorrow, huh? Before anyone says something they might regret. - Exactly, calm down, Raph. - No, I won't calm down! You spoiled my evening, you spoiled her date, you cut Emile's penis! - That's kind of a funny enumeration, isn't it. - I'm going to ask you to get out of my house. - Ah no, no, no, no, no, you're not going to whisper to me. - I think you deserve being whispered to. - No, no, no, no, no, it's been 12 years since she last whispered to me. And you know, when she whispers to me, it's because she hates me, do something. - I'm going to ask you to get out of my house and to go think about what you did while I handle my son's penis. - Don't be such a baby, Raph. - Stop, Maria. - Ah! Raph, come back! - No! You're going to have to understand that everything doesn't revolve around you! I had to convince Joe that you were able to babysit at fucking 30, at fucking 30 years old! You think everything magically works out. Well, it doesn't. We're the ones patching things up! You're not the fucking centre of the universe! Come on! - Hi! Hello, I'd like to order. - Look, me, I would like to go to Punta Cana, We all have dreams. I'll have the shepherd's pie, please. - A sandwich? Perfect. - I'll have the shepherd's pie. Please. - Look, there's none left. - There's a full pan of it right there. - Are you calling me a liar? - Yes. - Sorry huh? All my serving spoons are washed, I wouldn't want to dirty them. - Hi! - Hello my dear! What can I get you? - I'd like some shepherd's pie. - Enjoy! - Thanks. - You can go to the cash. Raymond! - What? - Bring me another apron! - OK! - Hey! What are you doing? - What the fuck do you want, bitch? - What did you just say to me? - I said what the fuck do you want, bitch? - You know I can flunk you, right? - Don't care. I already flunked twice. - Why am I not surprised? - We're busy, can't you see? - Ah really? You sure? Check it out, I have a gun. And I'm not afraid to use it. - OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, it's all right ma'am, it's OK. See you tomorrow, jackass! - That's it! Hands up! Get out of here bunch of losers! Woah! That was close! - You really have a gun? - No, it's the wooden penis. - You won't tell anyone, will you? - Does that happen often? - Since the beginning of the year. But I don't care. - No, you do care, Elliot. For real, sometimes, it's OK not to be cool either. OK, Elliot, tomorrow we're going to see the principal. - No! I can't. I don't want anyone to know. - Tomorrow at 4, I'll be there, I'll fix this. - What are you going to do? - Do you trust me? - No. - See you tomorrow. What does he want? Hello, Myles! - Maria! - Yeah? - Are you in a bar? - Yeah. - With your back to me? - Depends where you're sitting. - Are you wearing a black sweatshirt? - OK, I don't feel like playing who is this. - I'll be right there. I can't believe you're here. Good news! An audition for a commercial. Country-wide! - Myles, I'm not an actor anymore, I'm... I'm now a high school teacher. - Come on, it's for a commercial, it's an audition. It can't be worse than teaching high school. - I don't see how telling thousands of people that I'm regular, every single day is better than talking to teenagers. - Listen, how about this, you go to the audition, if it doesn't work out, I'll never bother you again. - No. - $100,000 in one afternoon. That's like 10 years of teaching, I guess? - Maybe you're exaggerating? - Barely. - I'll think about it. Aren't you supposed to be somewhere? - No, I was looking for you. It only took me an hour. - You didn't think of texting me? - I believe in destiny. It worked. I found you. So are we on? Come on. Come on, one last time, please. - Hi! My name is Maria Escondite de Bellerue and I'm auditioning for girl no. 2 in the yogourt commercial. A little tight, but OK. OK, I'm ready. Mmm! This is an amazing explosion of flavours! I can do different variations if you want. - Hey! Ellishito! - Get over here! Hey! - Good, I did my stop. Elliot! Elliot, am I on time? - Go to hell! - I'm sorry, it's not my fault, I had an audition for a yogourt commercial. - I hope you get it so I never have to see you again. - Ah, I'm sorry, come back! I'll make it up to you, promise! Elliot! Christ. - “Virgil is a little man who lives in the clouds... He goes around Earth and the world seems very small to him, it's..." “It's morning, but this morning isn't exactly like the others.” - Excuse me. - What's wrong? - I don't know. I think I'm feeling bloated. And I think that's why I'm not feeling good. Just one fart and it's all going to be fine. - Stop. - What's wrong, what's wrong... My mother's dying, that's what's wrong. You were right. - As usual. - It's not that hard to be happy, after all. It's unfair, you can't just... you can't just die like that, it's stupid. - I don’t get to decide, you know. - But who's going to smell my farts and think it’s not funny? - Everyone, don't worry about it. And if, let's say, sometimes, I'm in doubt and I don't feel good and... I don't understand anything, what am I to do, what do I do? - You're amazing. Trust yourself. Don't worry about it. - What are you going to do when you're in heaven? - I'll drive them all nuts. They won't be able to kill me. - I love you, Mom. Maria, I bequeath you my happiness... Mom. Coming! Coming, coming! - I'm selling chocolate, it's $3. - “Good evening ma'am. “My little sister is very sick. And I'm selling chocolate for $3, it's for cancer.” Usually, that's how they do it. - I don't have a little sister. - Start over. - Good evening ma'am. I'm selling chocolate to buy a motocross. - Excuse me? And what are you going to do with a motocross besides drive your neighbours crazy? Come back! Give me everything you have. I'll give you 40 bucks. Ooh! I'm not giving you $40 for your motocross. It's because I think it's cool, what you're doing. You work hard, you knock on doors, you're really earning your money, congrats. And also because I just smoked 3 joints and I don't feel like going to the store to buy chocolate. Promise me you'll always be this hard-working. Repeat after me. I promise... - I promise... - ... that I'll always work hard... - ... that I'll always work hard... - ... to make my dreams come true. - Could you just give me the 40 bucks. - to make my dreams come true. - to make my dreams come true. - Ms. Maria. - Ms. Maria! - Thank you and good evening, young entrepreneur. - Dad, I sold everything to the stinky lady! - Hey! I'll slash your tires on your motocross! Ah, and forget it, I would have done the same thing at your age. Poor baby! I so sorry about your mom. - But why didn't you call us? - I thought you didn't love me anymore. - No! We still do! It's just that sometimes, you're hard to love. - I know. - You OK? - I already miss her. She just left and I already don't know what to do. - You're stronger than you think, you know? You just can't stop trying. Oh! - Ah! I would give you a hug too, but the smell of weed and pickles, I just can't, ah! - It's my 2 basic fragrances. - Yes. If you need something, anything, we're here for you. - Anything? - I need Joe. - My Joe? - Hello there, having a pleasant evening? - It's not evening. - Ah, it's because I've always wanted to say that. - OK, so you, of all the things cops would say, “pleasant evening” is your favourite? - Look, let's discuss this later, OK? How you doin', homies? - Come on, we're not in a movie. - Look, I told you we would discuss this later. - What can we do for you, Lady policewoman? - Call me officer. We received a call. We were told there were 3 bums terrorizing kids in the school's hallways. - You know what this means? - It means you are under arrest for sexual harassment, and that's a minimum 30 years jail time. - Come on, don't! - OK, it's not nice to bully other kids, OK? You bug my friend Elliot again, you'll pee your pants until you get a urinary tract infection, is that clear? - Yes, sir. Have a nice day. That was hot, right? - You intimidated three sixteen-year-olds, bravo. - I scared them, like Maria asked. - You're not real cops, are you? - No, we're friends with Maria. - Yeah, it makes sense. - We were good, no? - You were fine. - Today, we celebrate the life, and death, of Sylvie. Huh... Sylvia. Maria, her only daughter, that we know of, has gathered us here so we could honour her. I would ask Sylvie's... Sylvia's, best friend, Manon, to come say her goodbyes. A round of applause for Manon! - Hello everyone! Is this on? Can you hear me? - Yes. - Good. Sylvia was my friend, my best friend. She didn't call me often, but when I called her and she answered, we would have long phone conversations. She really liked talking on the phone. I liked our conversations. She made me feel special. We would talk about our favourite singers who passed away, movies from another era. She loved Dalida and Joe Dassin. And the movie Casablanca, oh, she kept... Excuse me, I forgot to put it on silent mode. Yes, hello? Really? It's an honour. OK, yes. Give her a kiss for me. Thanks. It was Dalida. She said Sylvia arrived in heaven and she's feeling good. - So this was Manon. Manon, everyone! Manon! - Does he work at a karaoke bar on weekends? - We...we...will now celebrate Sylvia With her favourite song. What she enjoyed most of all, was music. And what she wanted, was to hear this song one last time. - That was Manon, ladies and gentlemen! Manon! 2 months later - Great! Where the hell is she? Hey! - So, your class? - I already hate them. - Ah, that's a good sign. Your mom would be so proud to see that you're teaching. - You didn't even know her. - No, but I don't need to have known her to know she'd rather see you teaching than telling everyone that your poop is top shape thanks to your cereal. - Ha! Of course, from that point of view, you're right. - Well, I have to go, I have trophies to dust. - Ah, the famous horse riding trophies. - No, no, pole vaulting. I wasn't so much into horse riding anymore. - For real? Anyway, everyone is really happy you're back. - I'm really happy to be here too. Jeez, is there any way to get served here? - Heads up, Maria!
