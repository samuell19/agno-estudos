Where is your phone? Oh my God. Where is it? Babe, you need to change this ringtone before the wedding. Okay? It's six forty five babe. Don't worry, I'll wake you up. - Maddy, it's 6:45. - Babe. Don't worry, I'll wake you up. Just fifteen more minutes, okay? You sure? Wake up, Jipange. You're listening to Norah on Top FM's Election Watch. And can you feel the excitement in the air? Only five weeks left until the nation goes to the polls. It is election countdown. This year, we're seeing the dominance of the two big parties that have led the country for decades threatened by a newcomer who's come from nowhere but has been consistently climbing the polls these past weeks. We are at the cusp of the elections. And as political temperatures rise, there are worries that the country could be engulfed in tribal clashes, as in previous elections. One who seems determined to overcome the divide between the ethnical groups is a young politician, Matthew Kowa. Will he succeed? Election Watch will keep you up to date. Shit! Babe. Wendo! Wendo. It's eight. What?! It's on. - No, me first. Babe no! - No. We are going to be so late. Oh shit! I've forgotten my dress. Hold here, and this too. - Thanks. - Okay. - Nyokabi! - Hello, Nyokabi. - Hi. - Quick! Okay. I'll see you. - I love you. - Bye. I'm so glad I left early yesterday. You look like shit. Well, it was worth it. Best engagement party ever! A pre-engagement-party party. Tonight is the main event. You better be ready for those parents. - Are you nervous? - Well… I think we are just going to play our roles, Mugeni, the most reliable fiancé, and me the most chased fiancée. Speaking of which, if my mum calls... Yeah, you spent the night at my place. Don't worry, I got you. You can use me as your scapegoat any day. Good. But it can't be too often 'cause my folks will start getting suspicious. Not if you shine tonight. Alright, I'll try. For now we need to rush because we cannot keep the client waiting. - We? Who made us late? - Come on. Five years ago, that banner was put up as a promise to the people of Jipange that they were going to build us a world class hospital. Yet here we are. Still in an empty dusty area. As empty as the promises of Njama Magero. As dusty as the empty dreams he keeps selling us. The youth of this country have always been at a disadvantage because of a generation of politicians who choose not to invest in our health or our future. Is it fair really for a community like Jipange, to not have a proper hospital? Is this really just? We'll change a few key words in the next speech. We need to include, women more in his messaging. Well his audience doubled last week but it's still not impressive. Kabi, calm down. You've checked the polls, I mean, Njama, 48 percent, Matata, 34 percent and Kowa got to 18 percent in what, the last two months? We can push him up to 25 percent. And then, you can talk to One Network TV and we can get him to the final elections debate. Well, from your lips to God's ear. I don't want you getting fired. Is this okay or not okay? Okay! I believe in Kowa. People from all walks of life, all bound together… Well, it doesn't hurt that he's so easy to look at. Brothers and sisters… Kabi, no. Stop it. Almasi Hotel Group needs me to go sort out their system. Some moron clicked on a phishing link. What about the security shield you had reprogrammed for them? Delivered… a month ago. And imagine they have not installed it. As long as they pay. I'm tired of them. I'll just go through the backdoor and install it myself. This coffee is terrible. What?! I like it. You have a better taste in whiskey. The one you brought last night… In fact, can you imagine I heard someone call it bourbon. Surely, 12-year grande, and the man goes ahead and drinks it like vodka. But we'll have more of it during the stag night. Man I can't wait! Speaking of which… are you ready for tonight? I am nervous as hell man. You know my parents, Wendo's parents… oil and water. Come on, it will all work out. Probably. Talk of road network, talk of good housing facilities… Hey. Your uncle again. - What?! - On TV. Water supply and… - I don't want to see him. - That's my strategy. I am meeting that old fool tonight. We have delivered 99 percent of all that we promised. It has been said that your greatest political strategy is disabling and destabilizing your political opponent. Some even claim that, your team employs aggression in some instances. How true is that? I believe in a fair playing field. We are tired! We are tired because that tomorrow has come. That tomorrow… - Kowa! - No way! Aggression is not a political tool I ever use. Never! - Leave! - No, ah! Please. - No way! - No standing here. - Move! Let's go. - Get out of here! Leave or you'll have it rough! Leave! You! - Move back! - Ah! No. Leave! Never! Okay. Thanks. We knew that our opponents would play dirty, especially Njama. Listen guys, I… I appreciate every single one of you and I appreciate your invaluable contribution to this campaign. I especially appreciate our two PR ladies from DTR, Wendo and Kabi, who… who have helped tremendously push this campaign forward. I am not going to back down. I will also completely understand, if anyone in here chooses to leave this campaign. I think I speak for everyone, when I say that today was… tough and scary. We've seen what happens to anyone who chooses to stand against Njama. But the fact that he is reacting this way just means that, he feels threatened. So it means we are doing something right. So thank you, for your offer, but I'm staying. I'm staying. I'm staying. I'm staying. I am staying. - I'm staying. - I'm staying. - I am staying. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. I appreciate. I appreciate it. Yeah? Are you sure you're okay? Yeah. What happened? Please, don't worry about it. It's nothing. Doesn't look like nothing to me. Well… while we were at the rally, some youths invaded the grounds - and just dispersed the crowds. - What?! Are you okay? I'm fine. Those goons got close enough to rip your coat. That's not nothing. Babe. It's just a coat. - My uncle is probably behind it. - Yep! It's always him or Matata. A very short list of suspects. I'll have to have a tough talk with him. No! Babe… what did we say is the mantra for tonight? - No… - Politics. Good. We'll be fine. Boss. Come on. Hi uncle. - Thank you for coming. - Hello auntie. - You are looking smart. - Thank you. My daughter, are you not feeling cold? - Cover yourself. - No mum, I'm fine. You keep it so you don't get cold. Okay. Okay mum. Let's meet inside. Mum. Wendo. - Hi dad. - Hi. Welcome. Why didn't you host this at a local meat joint? - This is too extravagant. - No, dad. Just go in. Let's meet inside. - Are you okay though? - Yeah, we are fine. - Welcome. - Thank you. Babe, that grilled meat request you better make sure it's there. He's been going on about it. Let's just hope tonight goes well, in the first place. Have you seen this place though? The in-laws insisted. Speaking of in-laws, are they paying for fashionably late? Girl, I don't even know. - Could it also be you? - Yeah? - Hey you. - Thank you. Don't worry. - It's okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Wow. Right there. Well. All is well? Yeah? We'll see. So, this is it. Hmm! Nice turn out. - Yeah. - Huh. - Mugeni! - Oh, June. - Hi, nice party. - Yeah. I think your in-laws look lost. Come on, be nice. I'm always nice. June, may I have a moment with my son? Of course, uncle. I am very happy for you. Son, it's so busy at the moment. I'd appreciate it if you did this after the elections. No. Dad, unlike you my life does not revolve around politics. But it should. Njama wins the MP seat again! Next elections, he runs for governor, then you take the seat. Nice try dad but, you've been trying this for years. Let's just enjoy today. No politics, okay? Mrs. Magero, Mr. Magero… Hello. Nice to see you. It's always good when we get together again. Can I just have Mugeni for a second? Make yourselves comfortable. Yeah? - Yeah! - Yeah? Guess who's here? Uncle. Hey. - Hey. - Yeah. Welcome. Thank you. So… this is the famous Wendo? - Yes. - Oh! Hmm. With a body like this, no wonder you're smitten. Oh! Sorry, been campaigning all day. I forgot. Hey, you. The cap is yours, and remember to vote for me. Yes sir. - Yes. Join the winning team. - Thank you. - Yes sir. - Growing strong together. - Shall we? - Oh. Hey. What? It's so pretty. So pretty. Thank you. Thank you. I've brought you soda. I think you are my problem. What is it? Kowa… Why are you waiting? Ladies and gentlemen. When I heard my nephew had found this exceptional young woman, I was truly happy. Let's face it. Wendo, the winner of The African Emerging Talents Scholarship. Top of her class in one of the most prestigious Universities. The youngest PR Manager at DTR. I love you. I mean… she seems perfect for my equally gifted nephew. Now you can imagine the shock when I found out that our future daughter-in-law is working for the enemy. I am sure if Wendo is willing to put this behind her, our two families can merge into one beautiful unit this memorable evening. And by joining my side, dear Wendo, it will help you save all the money you use to repair torn suits. Do you know about this? Wendo… you mean you brought us here to have us embarrassed? Mum, just calm down. It would have been better if we stayed. Kowa is an anarchist! - Dad. - He will hurt our tribe more than the current MP is already doing. Hey, are you saying I am a tribalist? Who doesn't know you? We all know who you are. Uniting our two families makes no sense. If the two families are not on the same side. I was quite fine with our children getting married. But that never meant joining your political outfit. Some things just can't mix. Guys… it's just a job. Kowa is a client like any other. Today it's Kowa, tomorrow it's Mercedes... No! Actually it's not just a job. I volunteered for Kowa because he showed me the choke hold that the two major tribes have on our politics, and that is killing this country. Maybe we need leaders who will unite all our tribes. I just can't believe it, that I spent a fortune on this, just to listen to this nonsense. - I think we are done here. - Yes. - Oh come on, dad! - Hey! No. - Dad. - Yeah, we are! We are. Let's go. - Put the plate down. Let's go! - Come on. Let's go! - Mum, we're just... - Ah! No. We've heard enough! - Dad. - No. Rahab doesn't have to go if she doesn't want to. Hey. Well, in that case, I see no reason why we should stay. Whatever you call this, you have no future. Well… we were naïve to think that politics wouldn't come up tonight. Maybe it would have been easier if you'd picked another client from the beginning. So, this is my fault? How do you think this looks? You working for my uncle's rival, how do you think it looks? Well, is his ego so fragile that he can't handle a little competition? You know how difficult this is, but still you had to make your opinion known. Wow! Thank you so much for your support. Look… I am caught in the middle of this babe. You on one side, and my parents on the other side. What am I supposed to do? Is this how it's going be then? Okay. Fine! This is Top FM's Election Watch and my name is Norah. In Jipange Constituency, the National Alliance Party and the Democratic Alliance Movement have switched power exclusively between themselves since independence, representing two major tribes. This year, however, the young Kowa, who was at first seen as a non-starter, has been steadily climbing the polls. And the self confidence of the old parties is waning. It is getting more and more exciting. You know what, I would like to uplift Mama Fatuma and her children, just like I assisted you and your children. And when I get into parliament, I will make sure I pass a law that states that all children in public schools are given free food. You definitely have my vote! I must vote you to parliament. - Thank you very much! - Thanks too. - I appreciate. - You too. Make sure you have registered to vote and pass the same message to your friends to register as voters. - God willing. - Thank you. Okay. Hold this. - Hi Mheshimiwa. - Yes. Thank you so much. - Yeah. - Good. Matthew Kowa, I'm running for MP here in Jipange Constituency. Yes and I'd love it so much if you would turn up at the Social Hall, where I will be discussing my manifesto in depth. - Will you handle Jipange? - I will, totally. Yes! The time is now! Share some change. Kowa. - Kowa. - Wendo, hey. - We had a meeting. - A meeting? - The one I scheduled, remember? - Oh! I was making phone calls most of the morning in the office. And then I thought I'd just come out here and connect with the people. That's great! Because, we are noticing your profile is getting bigger and bigger and with more attention you are getting from the press, - we think… - It would be best for you and the team to start wearing these. Let the people be part of your campaign. Okay. I like it. - Good. - Yeah. Okay. So, we were thinking tomorrow, we gonna have a meeting with … the people from... You! Who do you think you are?! Get out of here! This is not your territory! - This is Njama's territory. - Watch out! How so? Bring the van! Madam. Madam! Gently. - Is she okay? - No. Lift her. - Gently. - Gently. Let's go. Shall we go with you to the hospital? No, just go back to the office. Kowa. And there he goes again. The bleeding heart. Now I have to re-work everything all over again and it's a pain. Kabi, not everything is about your schedule. Okay. Why is this taking the whole day? I clicked on a link and it... How many times have I told you not to click on foreign links? If you can't get that then you aren't cut for this field. You might as well go get another job, selling mandazis or something. Okay thank you, we'll pick this up tomorrow. You almost made that intern cry. Let's go get a drink. You need to cool off. - Have you planned for the week? - Hey you two! Your intern is here. Delphine. Okay. Cynthia can you take Delphine for a spin around the agency? And then you and I can sit down tomorrow. I'll communicate my expectations to you and then, - um, vice-versa. Okay? - Okay. Delphine. I've noticed someone has been distracted all morning. I was afraid to ask, how did it go last night? It went straight to hell. Our marriage may be over even before the traditional ruracio ceremony. All because I, I'm working for Kowa. Would it be helpful if I took over the account and you work on another client? Thanks but I've never been quick to back off. I'll see you. Let's just be honest bro. Wendo's family and your family, two different social and financial backgrounds. I feel like… both families will have trouble relating. Even if it wasn't for the tribal or political differences. Listen, all I'm saying is that maybe… maybe there are too many obstacles for you to overcome as a couple. Hey bro, you are starting to sound like my dad. Anyway… that Wendo is quite a stubborn one. Tell me about it. I mean, why doesn't she just put the Kowa job aside? That's the point. I mean, there's so many other clients at the agency where she works. But she sticks to this guy. Kowa is really popular with the women. They love him. Is he married? He used to be. What used to be? Yeah. His wife passed away. Maybe they all want to be the next Mrs. Kowa. You know, just saying. Hi. What are you doing here? I thought we said tomorrow? Um… Yeah, I was just looking for the new poster designs. - Here you go. - Thank you. N… nothing else - Hi! - Hey. Hey, how was your day? It was… It was okay. The lady we took to the hospital, uh, she's going to be fine. Just a few minor injuries but no broken bones or anything serious. Oh …that's great. I saw your interview. The journalist from this evening asked me if I am going to marry again - anytime soon. - Yeah.. Don't worry about them. They're just trying to get juice to attract viewership. But, I loved what you told them. "Today's agenda is about the country, not me." That was amazing. Oh yeah, so… Kabi sent me our schedule for tomorrow. We are gonna be meeting with the constituents for the opening of um… the four general maternity wards… Sorry, can you give me a minute? What are you doing? And then, tomorrow afternoon, uh… we're meeting with the Small Business Association just to hear out their concerns. So I'm gonna work on the speech tonight and I'll give you the printout tomorrow. Okay? Yeah. Oh my God, yeah. Okay. Okay, um… I guess I'll see you tomorrow? Bye. Bye. Mugeni, what… Baby girl. So how was your day? Your sister here must accept that she made the wrong choice. Not so my love. She still has a chance. If you came with me to church, you would have found out that we have a new pastor… who is… he is not ugly. And to add onto that, he supports Matata. You know what, I feel very full. Excuse me. Sorry about that. You know, mum and dad. Don't be like me. When you get a chance, just move out. I think I can handle them. How are you guys handling the situation? We're not handling it. We're not even talking to each other. I don't know what to do. Come on. You've been through a lot. And you've made it through. See. I mean, just look at these things. All this is you. You're the strongest person I know. Like literally, you're my rock. My warrior. Hey. Cheer up. It will be fine. Okay? Come here. You'll be fine. - Hey. - Hey. Could you come in for a second? Okay. I am meeting a client in 15 minutes. Trust me, this is more important. Where are we going? To the place we first met. I remember a carefree, young, 23 year old just… dancing to music, not knowing her life was about to change forever. And I remember thinking, "What a graceful dancer!" I didn't dare talk to you at first. And I remember thinking, "What an arrogant snob." Then why did you dance with me? Because then I thought, "What a handsome snob." I just wish our parents could see us. Like this. Now. And realize that all these tribal, political stuff, they don't matter to us. We have to talk to our parents. Face to face. Yeah? Together? N…No. Maybe, we can approach them individually, for now. Okay. Then I'll talk to your parents and you talk to mine. I don't think I speak the same language as the mighty Mageros. So, we'll each speak to our parents individually, then regroup and we'll see how to go from there. Okay. Sounds like a plan. Dad. You are back early. Yeah. Wendo! Hi mum. - Hi. Were you chased from town? - No. Wendo has to stop working for Kowa. There are no two ways about it. She's just doing her job. It's important to her. I didn't think this relationship would go on for so long. You have no future. Why don't you call up Monica? Her father has just been appointed CEO of Africom. Then you won't have to worry what confused tribe your children will be. What's uncle doing here? I don't know. I told him we are meeting and he said he wanted to come. I'm tired of you all trying to run my life. Hey, Mugeni! Move your car! I'm leaving. Why the rush? I heard you wanted to make peace, so… I thought I'd come and offer my help. Help? There's no peace because of you. Well, I know I was a little rash at the party. Just give me a minute. I talk to your parents. You may like the results. I suspected there was an issue. - Okay. - Seriously mum. Okay. Tell us. So… um… Mugeni and I talked and… we just think this tribalism thing is such a non-issue. Wendo. I've told you time and again - that these Kora people can't be trusted. - Wendo, this politician that you are working for will be the reason for us losing everything. He's called Kowa. Whatever. His job is stealing Matata's votes. - So you're saying he shouldn't run? - He can't win! Look… - Matata is able. - Totally. And that will help bring the government back to us. The boy is still insisting on his Joga wife. There's an opportunity here. Our latest polls show that Kowa's likeability is based on people thinking he's less tribal. Ma'am. Brother, let's get these two married as soon as possible. - What?! - This will benefit us. How? We can show how liberal we are, embracing the opposition, the youth, even the lower class. Dad, you are talking about us, but the only people benefiting, are they not the rich Jogas? As Jogas, once we are in power, we develop the country, and everyone benefits. Very true. Listen Wendo… and I want you to listen carefully. Now, I've not been promoted for the last ten years, not because I don't have the qualifications, no. It's because Koras promote Koras. Dad, what is the difference? We do not steal. Of course we do! There is no difference between Koras and Jogas in power. And that's why, I am supporting Kowa because he is not tribally inclined. So if he wins, - how will our tribe benefit? - Stop. - What? - Dad. Can you stop thinking about tribalism for just a second? - But that's where the problem is. - No. True. Kowa is one of us. He grew up here, he knows our struggles. Kowa even started a food program for kids, in this area. I mean, Rahab and I could have been one of... - Wendo! - …these kids! Mum. Kowa will bring development. And not only in this constituency, but also in this family. Wendo, if you really valued your family, you wouldn't stand with them. - Kabi, why are you fighting us? - Why? I need to shower. Don't you dare finish the water. We will agree to the marriage. We do not want Wendo to leave Kowa's campaign anymore. Why the sudden change? There's a catch to this, right? Not really. Just two conditions. One, you marry fast before the elections. And two, Say IT helps push Njama's campaign. Wow! He could use help with the youth vote. That's Kowa's base. And we need to cut his gains there. There is no way my company is going anywhere near his campaign. Don't forget who gave you the seed money to get your little start-up off the ground. And don't forget who's been giving you the capital to keep it afloat. Wow! Wow! Wow. And you wonder why I don't want to get involved in your politics. I wonder how long Wendo is going to wait for you to sort out your family drama. Alternatively, you could say yes, give her the wedding of her dreams and… everyone is happy. - You okay Doris? - Fine. Oh Lord! What is wrong? I don't want to stress you with my problems. What problems? Just tell me. It's my parents. They don't want Mugeni and I to get married because of our tribes. They also don't like the politician I am working for. You are such a good girl. You shouldn't be working for a politician. Seriously Doris. - They are all snakes. - Not all. All. I don't like talking about politics. Why? During the last elections, I lost my mother, my father, and my sister. Their neighbors raided them and burnt down their house because a politician told them that our tribe did not belong there. I'm so sorry Doris. But that's why I'm campaigning for Kowa. Because Kowa is not tribal. Ever since we started campaigning, he has never mentioned them at all. I believe if we elect someone like Kowa, that's how we will end tribalism. If you continue working for Kowa, won't you be going against your parents' wishes? Can you live with that decision forever? Hey! Hey babe. I have great news. I got my parents to change their mind. What?! They're not against us getting married anymore. In fact, you don't even have to stop working for Kowa. Just like that? Just very convincing, I guess. Well, at least one of us made progress. My meeting didn't go that well. And by the end of the conversation, it seemed like, they're even more against it. Anyway, I'll try and give them some time and maybe they'll come around. What if they don't? Well, I will drag them to that ruracio myself, kicking and screaming, okay? But babe… You could try again. You know, a different strategy, maybe? Why are you pushing this? Because, babe I want us to get married as soon as possible. Maybe even before the elections. And why is that? Because I want us to get over this hurdle, baby. Before my parents change their minds again. It's gonna be a long day. You were tossing and turning the whole night. Weird dreams. Just fighting with my parents. But you guys are finally on the same page. I know, right? You should get yours on board too. I don't want to think about that right now. I need to focus on the campaign. - Okay. - I'll see you later. - Bye. - Have a good day. You too. - I love you! - Okay, bye. - Hi. - Hi. How's my star this morning? - Yes. - Yes. Okay. So what do we have for today? Hello Jipange, this is Norah with Election Watch. New polls are out. This young candidate, Kowa, is connecting better and better with young voters and gaining ground. My biggest problem with this area is security. You see, the work I do demands I leave very late and I've been mugged twice. - Twice? - Twice. Yeah, we'll be there in an hour. Okay, I'm really sorry. Thanks. An hour? - Chick, have you seen the traffic? - Oh, no. Let me just go and get him. We have to beat the incumbent. - You are the one... - Thank you. - Thank you. - We need to go. - Don't forget my report. - Alright. Where are you going? Hey, boss. Relax! - What tribe are you? - Our tribe doesn't matter. Hey, listen! Answer the question! Don't be stupid. Who do you think you are? Get hold him! Hold him! Get out of here! You dog! - Kabi! Kabi, give me the money. - What money?! The lunch money! Just give it to me. Quick! Fool! - Who do you think you are? - Hold him Nice! - Let's go. - Are you okay? Let's go! - Are you good? - They're gone. You're good? - Yeah. - Sorry man. Hey, thanks. We couldn't have made it out of there without you. - What's your name? - You can call me Toti. No problem. - Thanks a lot! - You saved us a great deal Toti. - You're good though? - Yes we are. I'm really tired with the bullshit going on in this area. And in fact from today, I'll be helping you guys even more. - Thank Toti. Thanks. - You're the kind of person we need… - …in our campaign. - For real? Actually, I'm a rapper from around. Perhaps, I could compose your campaign song. Come on, give us some lyrics. They're stuck in the old ways We can change though I believe in you boss You'll bring the change bro And this thing is not easy And if it was easy Then anyone could do it But you know life has ups and downs Sometimes less ups than downs But if you stand for the people Then God is on your side And if God is on your side Then on your side we slide. So let's do this like we supposed to From bottom to top Because the future is now And the future is you - Hey! - Hey, Toti! - That's a good one. - I like that! Okay. We'll wait for the scans and then we shall release you. Okay. Thank you In fact, I'm thinking we can use this to schedule a press conference. You know, garner those sympathy votes. No. What? Why not? Because that's not what our campaign is about. Listen, we need to move the masses with our message. Otherwise, we are no better than the Njamas of this world. Hey. Thanks again, for saving me today. It's a matter of principle. And I believe deep down you could have done the same for me. You are welcome. See you guys. Oh, Kowa… those scratches on your face, they make you look heroic. - Yeah? - Yeah. Alright. Get well soon. - See you guys. Bye. - Thanks. See yah. Hi babe. This job is getting dangerous. Maybe you should quit. Oh no, I thought about it. I can't do that because it's exactly what they want. They, you mean my uncle? Yeah, of course. Who else? And Kowa is worth the risk. Risk? He's… special. And the more I spend time with Kowa, the more I actually believe that he is going to change this country. Anyway, shall we? Power of the people. Yes, come in. Here are the cards you asked for. I said yellow. I am so sorry. Let me go get them. Does she ever listen? She is just eager to please. Hi. Ray, can I call you later? I'm a bit busy. Your mum is driving me crazy. She's constantly complaining, arguing and crying. You have to sort this thing out. But I already talked to her. So what's gonna be different this time? I know, but you'll just have to try again because... Is this Wendo? I thought so, So, it's like this. There is a church service at four. Make sure you are there. Okay. Fine. Praise the Lord Praise the Lord Let the earth hear His voice Praise the Lord Praise the Lord Let the people rejoice Oh come to the Father Through Jesus the son And give Him the glory Great things He has done Praise… I don't understand why you want to get married to that conman. He's not called conman, mum. He's called Mugeni. Whatever. How many broken marriages between Koras and Jogas? Well, I'm guessing as many as broken ones between Jogas. No. I disagree. I am yet to see those that have succeeded. Maybe they would succeed if they got a little support from their families, mum! Oh glory, great things He has done Be blessed. - See you on Sunday. - God bless you. Bye and be blessed. - Ah, Pastor John. - Yes. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. That was such a powerful sermon. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. I appreciate it. This is Wendo. This is my eldest. Wendo, good meeting you. - Nice meeting you too. - I hope you come more often. I'm a bit busy with my job at the moment so… Well, yes … your mother is troubled about that. You are helping this Kowa, right? Yes? You don't seem too excited about that. See … God has divided his creation into sheep and wolves. And also human beings into different tribes for a reason. God commands us, "Honour your father and mother and heed their guidance even to whom you cast your vote for in the elections." - Amen. - Amen. Pastor John, Amen. And, where is that written in the bible? Well, um… I'll have to look… I'll ha… I'll have to look it in the Holy Book. And how about we talk about over dinner tonight? My chicken stew is famous. Thanks but I'm actually vegetarian. Don't worry. Hey, Wendo! Wendo! You! Wendo! Then our calendar is full. People, good morning. Have you seen today's polls? We need to talk. Last week, Kowa was up to 29 percent, and I was so happy that I wanted to invite you back here for some champagne or something. As of this morning, Njama is back to 53 percent, - and Kowa is back down to 19. - What?! How? It appears that Njama has embraced digital marketing. - I'll fix it. - I hope you do. For your sake. I don't want to end up following a 25 year old in her romanticism of converting one of our country men into the next Martin Luther King. Let me be vey clear. If you don't sort this by next week, you're going. This is the deal, and I'm sticking to it. You won't believe what I just found out. What? - You're not going to like it. - What? Guess what company is running Njama's digital campaign? You're working for your uncle now? It's the price I had to pay. Work for him, get our marriage approved. - That's the sacrifice I had to make. - Sacrifice? Are you kidding me?! Sacrifice? Yes. Sacrifice! Look, I also feel awful about this but our relationship is worth it. If you had left Kowa, I would not have had to take the deal. No, you can't just bend like that. It's bend or break, my dear. Or maybe that's what you want so that you can go and become the next Mrs. Kowa. - Excuse me? - I've seen the way you look at him. - The photos… - Oh my… - Have you actually gone mad? - I know what I saw. The way you caressed him. What are you… What do you mean, when? When did I caress him? At the hospital. He was attacked. I was reassuring him. Yeah, right. Look… I know that women love him. Just tell me the truth. Something has happened between the two of you, right? My God. I can't even look at you right now. Look, babe. Babe. Wendo! Babe! Fuck! This is the night edition of Election Watch, with your very own Norah. We all know that Kowa has been losing ground, but the question is, will the young PR genius Wendo help him again at the polls? Will Kowa and his PR team find a strategy? Hi man. What's up? - All fucked up, man. - What happened? You got into my head, that's what happened. I confronted Wendo about her relationship with Kowa. - What did she say? - Nothing. She said nothing. She just left the apartment. I'm finished man. I'm finished. I'm driving around town in circles like a lunatic. Just come over. I have some bourbon around. Thanks man. I'm on my way. I mean, you realize where Wendo comes from… lower middle-class. I mean, these girls always have an instinct for power. My friend, you've done so well as an intermediate step but then, this Kowa comes out of nowhere. Do you remember Sandra from campus? That girl used to have lower-class instincts. Just like Wendo. So, Kowa becomes the next MP. Probably the much better fit. Boom! You're out. Poor fool. No fool no more, bro. We are going to push my uncle's campaign so hard that Kowa will crash. Kowa is really climbing up the polls. I mean, I just can't wait to see the three of them in an election debate. - Hello! - Hi! - Hello! - Hi! - You're good? - Yes we are! - Pay attention! - Listen up! - Pay attention! - Listen up! - I'm saying pay attention! - Listen Up! I am tired of hearing "the youth - Are the leaders of tomorrow." - No! So I'm standing with Kowa because the future is now. Let's put behind the life Of living in sorrow Vote for Kowa and Make that change right now 'Cause it's about time Our dreams became a reality The old could not deliver Like a tooth with a cavity - I'm saying pay attention! - Listen up! - Pay attention! - Listen up! It will require us to stop All this negativity Stop focusing on tribalism While our common enemy is poverty So, this is that time This is the minute, this is the hour That was their time but now this is ours If you really want that change Again I repeat You better vote for Kowa - I'm saying pay attention! - Listen up! - Pay attention! - Listen up! Thank you very much. I go by the name Toti. Now, it is time for you to pay attention and… Listen up! Help me welcome the next MP of Jipange Constituency, Matthew Kowa! Kowa! Kowa! Kowa! Kowa! Kowa! Oh my! My goodness! It's so nice to see so many young people. Right now, we are losing a billion. A billion shillings, per day! Let's do away with this nonsense of a two-class educational system that's already overpriced. Let's instead use that tax money to make sure that there is free education, for all! So that the full potential of our people can finally be unleashed. I ask you again… Hi babe! Talk to me. - Hey. - Okay. Is something wrong? Are you free? I just want some sisterly bonding. Sure! I thought you'd never ask. There's this great new place that I want us to check out. Let me send you the pin. Then we can meet later. Toodles! I already can see it. Two hundred guests drinking champagne. We'll have a choir from the slums over there. And in the center, we'll have the biggest cake ever. And over there, later in the evening we'll have the Lola Band performing their number one hit. Over there, the political representatives seated right next to Wendo's family. Power meets peasants. And our dream couple will sit right here. All eyes and camera on Wendo and Mugeni, talk of the town. Oh, I spoke to the manager and he said we can have this place on the 15th. - Of this month? - Hey, wake up. That's the deal. Tonight, you can sell this to Wendo. As your idea. Shouldn't we focus on your online strategy instead of being here planning my wedding? - Rahab, wait! - Come on! Switch off the phone. Not every time we talk of work. There we go! Okay. - What do you want to show me? - I thought you'd never ask. Ta-da! The new bridal shop. Imagine… Ooh my lord! Look at this! …comes the bride! Wendo! Babe! Aw! Gosh. You look stunning! Oh my God, see how you look. God. So, what do you think? - It's okay. - Like, just okay? Okay? Wait! Where is the Wendo who has opinions over everything? Check out this dress with a tail. Come on! Babe, listen. This is going to be the day you get married. Okay, babe, what is it? I mean, don't you like the dress? Don't you like the place? I have other options. Like, talk to me. What's happening? I don't think we are going to have a wedding at all. We have data from three million Headbook users from our voting area. You know just insights into what they think, what they like, what they are clicking on, what they are discussing… You know, what they wish, what they fear, things like that. So using my new algorithm tool, I have analyzed this data, and realized that the largest group, 50 percent of them or one and half million of them, are people aged between 20 and 30, which most of them are still undecided. But from what we already know, a lot of young people already consider Njama too old. Well, he could just dye his beard. Anyway, just kidding. The real solution here, is one, three, one point five million. What? - So let me make this easy. - Yes. One, three, and one point five, which basically means, one hashtag, three influencers, and one point five million young people. And just think about this. This number. Uh… one point five million. Yeah? If we get only a third of this number liking their posts… Which a third is 500,000. That means 500,000 people who are already interested in you. But that's not enough. For us to be able to crush the disgusting Kowa, we have to move this number from from five hundred thousand, to one point five million. So how do we do that? That's why we are already developing a software that is going to give them fake clicks and likes so that they can move the likes from five hundred thousand, to one point five million. Family genes, waking up finally. Okay. So now we have the strategy. What we need is what to feed the influencers. - Like what? - Like something flashy to always push hard on social media. Suggestions? You could become the country's healer. You could get tents, hire doctors, and nurses, and take a medical camp to the slums. Just overnight. I give you health, you give me your vote. Vote for Njama. I give you health, you give me your vote. - Mummy vote for… - For Njama. - Your health… - My wealth. - Vote for… - For Njama. Mheshimiwa. - Mheshimiwa. - Yes. Where is the hospital? Go at the back, you will be served. - There are many doctors. - You want to be a permanent leader here, yet you are putting up temporary structures. Where is the hospital? This is a tent! - We haven't come here to camp. - So… Where is the hospital? Mheshimiwa, you will... Do not touch me! Hey, I'm dying… Close to the citizens' door. No one else has ever done such a thing! Or have you seen anybody else? I am a peoples' person. I love people. So I love seeing people healthy. With poor health, it is impossible to eat. With poor health, you can't go to work. With poor health, you can't vote for Njama. Therefore I am a person. I'm a loved person. I can even see all of you came because you love me. I will answer a few questions because I am leaving to pitch a tent like this one to help the citizens. If any of you has questions, please go ahead. No one else has done such a thing, or is there? This is our taxes. This is a lie! Sorry. Can I have a moment? I must admit that ever since Say IT took up Njama's campaign, we've been losing some traction. So here is what I suggest. We take a step that no politician has ever taken in this country. Kowa, you open up all your business and private accounts to the public. Show the nation that you have minimal financial means to work with. Maybe we can convince them that you are just as equal. What's your message? Time for the rich people, who've been leading this country only for them to exploit and get richer, is over. Truth, honesty, humility and authenticity. This is the new currency, which should fuel the politics in this country. That's what you wanted, right? So, Mugeni. I hope you are set for the 15th wedding party? How is this your business? Ann is just worried about the location. They called yesterday. We have only a few days before they rent out to someone else. I'm working on it. You know how women are with weddings. Mheshimiwa. Wait. Ladies and Gentlemen… - Come, you need to see this. - …We're here to announce that Matthew Kowa, candidate MP for Jipange Constituency, in order to show complete transparency will open up all his personal financial accounts to the public for scrutiny. You may now direct all your questions to Mr. Kowa. Mr. Kowa! What motivated you to declare your wealth, while some of your competitors have refused? - Thank you. - Will you disclose all your secrets? Thank you for the questions. Um, first of all, our debt ceiling right now stands at trillions of shillings. And in a country where grand scale corruption… How did you not know that they were planning this? - In order to show complete transparency… - You and Wendo sleep in the… same bed for goodness sake. Uncle, why don't you also open your accounts? You moron. That would be the end of my and your family. Time for plan B. What's plan B? 'Please stay away from my daughter. Mongoose. So, they will target you with inexperience. So make sure you talk about the things you've done for Jipange Constituency, and make sure to mention the hospital - as many times as you can. - Okay! And attach its failure to discredit Njama. - Okay? - Understood. - Good. - Good. Thanks Wendo. Have I ever told you you remind me of my wife? She was focused, like you. I mean, she was tough but… she was also sweet. Like you. I… am flattered, Kowa. But now you need to focus, on the debate. - Yes. - All the best. Five minutes till live. Everybody be ready. It's about three. Stand set. Let the white balance. We can't do anything on this call. - Thank you very much. - Okay, guys? You're ready? He's the guy. Kowa is shining. Makeup. Let's get some powder on Kowa. - Njama. - Alright. One minute till we are going live. - Thank you. - You're welcome sir. - This is mine. - Let's give them facts. Alright, guys. Get ready. We're live in five, four, three, two, one. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Tough Talk, the elections watch. Two weeks till the elections and tonight, we are looking at the MP's race for Jipange Constituency. With me in the studio from the Democratic Alliance Movement, Robert Matata. From the National Alliance Party, the incumbent and current member of parliament, Njama Magero. And the independent and newcomer, Matthew Kowa. Thank you for having me. Matthew Kowa shot up like a rocket in the last one month. Came out of nowhere and climbed up the polls to 33 percent. Just maybe, this success story may be coming to an end tonight, as a few minutes ago, some disturbing news has reached our TV station, regarding you, Mr. Kowa. Let's take a look at what has come up tonight. The reports coming in are that when Mr. Kowa opened his accounts to the nation a few days before to underline his clean image, he kept something hidden. Mr. Kowa is alleged to own a house in the city which he uses as a brothel for some secretive clients. Our sources report that the women are held against their will, and some of them are under age. We will deliver a follow up in the next hour. Our sources also report that the money from Mr. Kowa's brothel is then fed into his campaign as donations from the public, to be cleaned off its dubious origins. - Do you have a response? - These allegations are obviously false. Then tell us why that house is in your name? I can't. Not at this time. So it is true, that the house is in your name? Could those other allegations also be true? Now we are coming back with some very dramatic scenes. - Is this true? - Look, I… Have we seen a candidate… - I can't talk about this right now. I… - …in the middle of a debate… - Look, we will talk about this later. - Kowa! Let's talk to these other candidates who are still here and get their opinions. Like I said, we have delivered 99 percent, of all that we promised. Talk of road network, - talk of good housing… - Have you come to gloat? Talk of electricity, water supply… I didn't know anything about this. Of course you didn't. We are looking at the MP's race for Jipange Constituency. With me in the studio from the Democratic Alliance Movement… Plan B, huh? He probably lacks the ability to lead. But it's also linked to questionable activities. That's not how my party runs its affairs. We've been and will always be clean and upright. And that's how we lead voters to a bright future. You're listening to Top FM Election Watch with Norah. Things fall apart for Matthew Kowa. If you tuned in to the TV live debate, you watched that serious allegations were made against him, leading to Kowa walking out of the debate. Most probably, this is the end of Matthew Kowa. Yes! I say, yes! This is good. No, give me a hand clap. Sorry. Yeah. As usual… Congratulations. Thank you so much. - Man of the hour. - Mugeni. - Wow! - Yeah. - We did it! - Oh. We did it. Oh, okay. Guys we need to celebrate, okay? We have waited long. - Thank you. - Excuse me. I've to go to the office. Mhesh. Mhesh. Even you, right? This also is the.. This is the….. Tano fresh. Here, we got a fat cheque. Stronger together! Together! You. It cannot be traced back to us, sir. I used a reliable PI. Get out of here or I call the police. Please let me just… Let… please. Wendo! Wendo! Wendo! Wendo! What's wrong with you? Are you mad? - Hey, can you stop shouting! - Kowa is innocent! That house, it's not a brothel. It's a safe house for battered women. My uncle framed him. I have proof. It's all in there. Something else. I'm sorry about what I accused you of earlier. I was out of line. I know you'd never lie to me. I missed you. I missed you too. I missed you too. What was so urgent? I'm busy. Just a minute. - Let's just wait for Kowa, first. - Okay. This is so interesting. At the ghetto? At this time? This is so cool! Wendo. It's late and I still have a lot that I need to get done. - What's this about? - I have a solution to your problem. This data stick… has proof that it was Njama who planted the fake brothel story. - Wendo, with this evidence we can... - Kowa, please just understand. I can't continue working with you anymore. Because it's putting a strain on my relationship with my parents, my fiancé. I think it's a great pity but, I have a good feeling that with this data stick and with Kabi by your side, you are going to win, Kowa. You will win. Okay. This is GYZ coming to you live on location, where it is expected that Matthew Kowa, candidate for MP for Jipange is going to step down, after serious allegations of sex trafficking. Thank you. I know that you're all expecting me to stand down today. But… it's actually the opposite. - Explain yourself then. - What do you mean, sir? - Are you sure about this? - What do you mean, sir? Can you please elaborate that? I have proof that what was said about me was a lie. The truth is, it's not a brothel. It's a safe house. A shelter, for women who have been victims of domestic abuse. Sir, are you sure about that? An initiative that was started by my late wife. Mr. Matthew Kowa, why did it take you so long to release these details? Because this fake news campaign has exposed some of the women who have found shelter with us. Putting them back in danger, not just by revealing their faces, but also revealing the address to our shelter. And that is why we decided to immediately move them to a new location. A place where they could not be found by their abusers. And to keep the true circumstances hidden until we had achieved our main objective. You might think that what Kowa is telling you here today is nothing more than a cheap excuse. But let me tell you that we have proof that the so called news from yesterday was nothing more than an attempt by the political opponent to ruin Kowa's reputation and ruin his chances of winning the election. Where did you get all this evidence from? - Exactly! - Are you sure about this? It cannot be traced back to us, sir. I used a reliable PI. Breaking news into the studio, a shocking video of Njama Magero plotting against his political opponent. Take a look. It was genius to turn a house for battered women into a brothel. That's what you pay me for, sir. The older generation is being scrutinized for refusing to partner… Can you imagine this? How did they get that information? Someone must have hacked them. Make sure you delete everything. Excuse me, sir. Move. Move! Move. Sir… Excuse me, sir. Any comment, sir? You can't do that! That's illegal! That's illegal! - No. - That's illegal! …get the views on the recent development in the shocking video of the veteran politician, Mr. Njama Magero, which has been making rounds on social media. - And we realize… - I left Kowa's campaign. …talked about its legitimacy is really leading towards a decline in… Good. At least you are back to your senses. At least. And, Mugeni and I have decided that we are going to have the wedding before the elections. What about the dowry ceremony? We can have it on Saturday. - What?! Two days? - Yeah. We cannot do it in two days. - It's not possible. - Mum… - No. - I know it feels rushed but I have sacrificed. I request you guys to sacrifice as well. And I'm sure we can pull this off by Saturday. And if you need any help with the preparations, I'm going to help you guys. …making rounds on social media, and you realise that this video, although Mr. Njama Magero has not come to talk about its legitimacy, is really leading to a decline in his poll numbers. This doesn't look good for Njama's re-election campaign. A snap poll by our network shows, his poll numbers, falling. Thank you very much, James, from studio. And I'm joining you here live from Katema market, in Jipange constituency… This is a disaster for our family. What will happen if we lose our seat? It will be tragic, I know, but that's not why we are here today. We are here to discuss your future wife. This scandal I'm sure helps her candidate, doesn't it? She doesn't work for Kowa anymore, mum. That's over. I wonder how she's feeling right now. She must be over the moon. Okay. Let's concentrate on why we are here. You are getting the wedding you wanted, on the fifteenth. We did it. But…what about your uncle? Well, I don't like the idea of having him there either, but not having him there will just raise more questions. I guess you're right. And, I don't think there's much he can do now anyway. Yeah, let's do it. It's only a few days and then we are free. I love you. I love you. I love you. They have a sister who chews gum like a cow chewing the curd. Hey, Rahab. Please tame your excitement. Last time didn't end so well but it's good that we meet again. We meet again for the sake of our children. I therefore take this opportunity to urge you to relax, and feel at home. Thank you very much. Thank you. Before we proceed, I'd like to say a few things. Families are brought together, by honesty. As much as I was pushing, and I am willing to celebrate this couple and their wish to merge our families, I have to admit that I am deeply disappointed. Disappointed? Now, everyone of you knows that my political affiliate was able to hit me big by secret information from my organization. Now, look. Hey! What's happening? Okay. We have this. What's happening? Delphine. I should have known. A witness confirmed to me that it was Wendo passing on the info and advising her colleague and Kowa to land a coup on the next day. On the press conference that you probably might have all watched. Wendo, what kind of shame is this? You said you had stopped... - Mum, stop. - I thought you said you had stopped working with Kowa! Stop it! Mum. Dad. It's true. I'm the one who gave Kowa that information. And I'm very glad that I did it. Because you're going to lose, Njama. You're going to lose. Wendo got that info from me. - I hacked your secret files, uncle. - What?! Then I gave the info to her. And she's right. People like you don't deserve to be in government. This drama has gone on for long enough. You will all receive an invitation to my wedding. If you come, that's okay. If you don't, still fine. And that, ladies and gentlemen, concludes today's program. Thank you. - Thank you. - Yeah. Nice to finally meet you. I've heard so much about you. Brothers and sisters… we have all come here today, all from different walks of life. All bound by one fundamental human expression… hope. All my life I have lived in Jipange Constituency. I was born and brought up here. You will encounter all sorts of poverty, desperation and so much suffering. Understandably so, no hope. Hope that has been passed down from generation to generation, from the people who came before us, who understood that our strength… our strength lies in our unity. A unity that has been undermined and suppressed… …by selfish interests. We the citizens, have lost all hope. And our leaders do not want us to have hope. Because they know, they know, a hopeful future does not include them. Does not include greedy and corrupt politicians. So here I stand. As a remnant of that hope. We believe in you! - But you know what? You know what? - Yes! I am not alone! I am not alone! - Because when I see all of you here, - Yes! I know and I can witness - that hope is still alive in all of us! - Yeah! The key to a greater future… …for all of us and our children, lies in your hands. It lies in all our hands. So please, let us unite and form this new tribe. A new tribe of peace and prosperity. A tribe that does not dictate your pocket or your ethnicity, but instead celebrates all our differences and uniqueness! I plead with you… use your vote to speak life into your dreams. Choose hope! Choose change! Choose yourself! Choose us! Choose me! - The future… - Is now! - The future… - Is now! - The future… - Is now! - The future… - Is now! Thank you! Thank you very much. With the results coming in from the final polling stations, we can now announce the results of the MP race in Jipange Constituency. With 54 percent of the vote, the winner is, Matthew Kowa. Matthew Kowa has managed to do the impossible with a landslide victory in Jipange Constituency. So, I'd like to wish my new tribe a night of peace, a night of hope, a night of triumph, and certainly a good night. This is Norah, your friendly deejay from Election Watch. Signing off.
