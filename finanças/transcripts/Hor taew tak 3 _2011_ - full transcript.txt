Fortunately, we saw both Phookan and Panda off to study abroad, otherwise they would tag along with us. I don't really want to go there, sis. It's good to have you with us, so we can deal with the new dormitory. Are we there yet, Khoi? - Here we are. - Stop the car. Let's go. Bring your luggage. Just like when I was in Manchester, it's raining lightly. Wow. That's our new dormitory, - isn't it? - It is. I have no idea about it. - It's so heavy. - In your heart? I mean this stupid toilet. - Pancake needs us. - It's us who need Pancake. You think so? Pancake. Pancake. - See some shit in Pancake's toilet? - Move your face closer. - Let's go. Come on. - That's our shit. Close the gates. Lock them up. Sis, why is it so quiet here? It is. There's nobody to welcome us. - Who's gonna let us in, Khoi? - I don't know. You know nothing, Khoi. Sis. Shit. - Why do you look so scared? It's me. - Why don't you come in, Pancake? Sis, I can't. The guardian spirit must be powerful. The mansion's guardian spirit, please let Pancake in. She's a good spirit. - What's it to do with the guardian spirit? - What do you think? - Just open the gates for me. - That's it? - Idiot. - Why do you talk ill of me? We're friends. We used to get along so well. Let's go. You're rolling your eyes at me? Bitch. It's good to have you, Pancake. Here. Your room. Why did I die in here? - Welcome. - Welcome. Sis, that's Songkram. - Moddam. - Yeah. I haven't seen you for years. You're still deaf? Good. Help Pancake with her room. Girl. I'd like to welcome you all to Maison la Dolce Vita. Three aunties, please follow me. - You called us aunties? - Three sisters, please follow me. That wing is our boy students' dorm. - I want to stay here. - Definitely not. Keep following me, please. As you can see, our mansion is beautiful. - Good God. - Be careful, honey. I'm alright. This wing is your residence. Please get your luggage and enter. Yes. Yes. - Who're those people? - They're our boy students. What's wrong with you? Quiet. Where have you been? I told you not to go to the Red Building. Listen to me. I'm Suanswart. Little monsters. Such a brat. He went to study abroad, right? - Right. - Bad students. You guys have seen things, right? So stupid. Why don't you listen to me? - Right. - Why the hell does he keep saying "right"? - Welcome to Maison la Dolce Vita. - Right. You want to go to sleep, right? Please. Let's talk tomorrow. We'll see you in the morning. - Who is he? - Mr. Suanswart. He's the dorm's keeper. Don't go to the Red Building. What's the Red Building? - A red building. - Bitch. - Right. - You're doing well, right? - Right. - Okay. Right. Our dorm's swimming pool is on your left. Honey, who's swimming at this hour? Nobody. But I saw someone there. - Where is he? - I saw him too. Where has he gone? - Did you see him? - I did. How could he just disappear in the blink of an eye? - Songkram. - Songkram, where are you going? I think I saw him. - I did. - Let's go. - He's gone. - Sis. Wow. This is the most beautiful dorm we've ever been in. Yes. Does it suit you, Cartoon? What kind of dorm would suit someone like you? - Bitch. - Mom. - This dorm is so beautiful. - We're not on vacation. We're on a mission. Pancake. Where have you been? You keep popping up here and there. Sis. - I've explored this dorm. - Really? From what I've seen so far, - this dorm is haunted. - What? - It's pretty evil. - Really? Yes. - It's coming. - What? - You can fight it. - You want a piece of me? - You can beat it. - Fine. You are one of the best. Don't be scared. Don't give up, Pancake. - Sis. - What? I can't hold it anymore. - Where are you going? - To the loo. - I thought you were fighting it. - I relaxed. Let's work on our mission. - Does it have something in here? - What is that? A ghost. - Are you scared? - Just pretending. Bitch. Scream when you see one. Come on. It's quiet. So creepy. - What? - You're pretending again? I don't want to see any ghosts. - She dresses like Namning. - Well, sis... How could that be Namning? She might've been reborn by now. Khoi, go and take a look. Check if it's Namning. - Not Namning, Mom. - You're a guy. Go. She's twitching. Khoi, take a look. Look at her face. She's not Namning. Decaying. Decaying. Why did we go upstairs? The door is over there. Quick. Why are you so scared? I'm not a ghost. Not a ghost, my ass. Your face looks horrible, bitch. Your saliva is all over me. Why did you just spit on my face? My phlegm. No. Not yet. Save it for when the time is right. - I'm gonna kill you. - I'm leaving. She's pulling my dress. She's pulling my dress. - I'm leaving. - Can I have my sister's dress? Don't you feel lonely swimming by yourself? Excuse me, ma'am. Would you mind if... Thank you. Ma'am. Wanna join me? I'm afraid I can't. Not in this dress. Maybe next time. It's alright. Good luck. How about this dress? Sure. Water will be bursting. Overflowing. Choose your words wisely. It has a double meaning. Are you flirting with me? - Ma'am. - Excuse me. I'm not that easy... - I'm sorry. - ...but approachable. Even though I look like this, boys go crazy about it. Ma'am. Why don't you look at my face? I've been distracted by something else. Shit. - Why up here? Where are we going? - Then why did you lead us here? You followed me. - I did. - Mod, behind you. Excuse me, ma'am. I'm not a ghost. Shit. - You're good. - See? I used to be a kick boxer. - Bitch. You hurt me. - There you go. - Let go of me. - Hit her. Do I look like a ghost? - What? - Mom. I told you to go outside. There's a ghost in here. It's right behind you, you know? What are you babbling about? I don't get it. You're my son, my mother or my father or I'm your mother? Why don't you tell me? The ghost is right behind me? I just wanna know why you guys keep running. I'm a human, not a ghost. I'm exhausted, trying to keep up with you. Bitch. Bitch. Songkram, hurry up. She might get you. Stop it. I know what you want. I can take it off myself. - You will ruin my dress. Here. - I don't want it. What am I supposed to do with this stupid dress? Have you been shot in the face? It's totally a mess. - So damaged. - Who are you talking to? - I'm talking to you. - Good. Not to me. Who am I talking to? Oh, it's the morning. I told you not to come here. You didn't listen to me. - It's so creepy. - Let's move. Take a peep. Anybody there, Khoi? - There's no one, Mom. - Told you, they're gone. All clear. Nobody's here. Khoi, you said there was nobody here. They're off to school. It's really annoying. I have to wake you guys up... Oh, my God. Should we feel nervous? I don't give a shit. - How about you? Nervous? - Not at all. You should be the one to feel nervous, but you don't. Will they throw up when we walk by? - Mom, are you nervous? - Me? Sure. Pancake. She never answers me when I call. She used to respond right away. Now she ignores me. Pancake. Pancake. Can you hear me? Why do you keep calling me? I'm sleeping here. How can I sleep right here? Oops. Has anyone seen me in this? Sis, I'm coming. Pancake. Pancake. - Sis. - Oh. Next time, you should bring my room with you. - It's heavy, you know. - Sorry. I forgot. - What the hell are you wearing? - A swimsuit. You went swimming, so you ignored me, huh? I almost got killed by that decaying ghost last night. Not just you. There was a ghost right here too. What? A male ghost. - Oh, a male ghost. - Well... You guys hyped up when I said it's a male ghost. What the hell is this dress? Is it nice? It is, but not on you. Nice shape. Chubby shape. Nice shape. Chubby shape. Nice shape. The male ghost? - Tell me. - Tell us. Sis, I'd like to suggest that you don't meet him. Why not? - He looks horrible. - How horrible? - Let me see your foot. - Sure. Here you are. It touched my nose. Let me tell you, your foot looks much better than his face. - Really? - Absolutely. - How about his and mine? - His is better. My foot looks better than my face? How about her face and his? No doubt. Her face can beat them all. - Really? - Her face is no joke. What about last night? Tell us more. Sis, sometimes I can hear your calling, sometimes I can't. Why don't you choose an easier way to contact me? - Like, promptly? - Yeah. Fine. Whatever you want. Do I ever say no to you? I can get you anything you want. Here. Blackberry. It can fit two SIM cards. You can watch TV with this. - Bitch. - What? - It's a dupe. - Just kidding. Here's a real one. We will give her our PIN numbers. - You all have these? - Yes, we have. Scanning barcodes? Sis, thank you. They're here. Greetings to all of you. - His mom must be a beauty queen. - I think she's faking it. These two talk back at you. They're right. I... was a Tamarind Beauty Queen three years in a row. - Sweet tamarind? - Chubby tamarind. Oh, she's chubby. Welcome to Pa Tong Misa. - Maison la Dolce Vita. - Maison Pa Tong Pizza. - Maison la Dolce Vita. - You're right. You'd better keep in mind that you came here just to be keepers of this dorm, not teachers. Don't forget that fact. It might sound a bit too harsh, but what I'm going to say might be not that harsh. You guys went to the Red Building last night? - How... - I know. - Who... - I just know it. From now on, I forbid you to go to the Red Building because I will move all the boys out to the Big Building. Are we clear? Isn't she too beautiful? I'm daunted. Daunted? - Intimidated. - Oh, I see. - Ms. Waewswart? - What's up? How did you know that they went to the Red Building? Is there anything that I don't know about? I know. Everybody knows. - You, Suantwarn. - Suanswart. Right. I mean Suanswart. First, we have to move those boys out of that dorm of happiness. Then, we find a way to chase those bitches away before they find out our secret. - What should we do with them? - I wonder. - I've got an idea. - What is it? We'll have a rite to summon Taengtong's spirit so we can remove the savage mole that we put inside him. He'll be back to savage mode and scare those bitches away. - You're mega clover. Brilliant. - It's mega clever. - Come again? - Mega clever. - You're mega clover. Brilliant. - It's mega clever. - You're mega clever. Brilliant. - Right. - Such a dumbass. - That's right. You must be very happy to get a chance to wear women's clothes again. Not really. I don't mind. - You swear? - Don't. Global warming is real. The weather has been chaotic. Thunderbolts can happen anytime. I can remember it. Oops. We have an exam tomorrow. It's too bad. - What subject? - Hey, Junior! - You still wanna go to the Red Building? - No. I've been haunted by that face. What? You guys won't go for it tonight? I'm out. What if Mr. Suanswart finds out about this? I still want to know whether what we saw the other night was a ghost. Boys. - Hello. - Hello. I'm Sis Taew. This is my son, Khoi. He's older than you guys. - Hi. - Well... everyone come closer to me. Can I ask you something? Well... I want to know that this place - and the Red Building... - Red Building? Right. What's with the Red Building? What are you doing, boys? Ms. Waewswart's already told you not to mingle with our boys. - I'm leaving now. - Please do. Mom, the decaying ghost. - You're not a ghost? - I told you I'm not. - Right. - A ghost can't be pretty like this. How on Earth can a person be this much of a mess? Please. Boys. All of you have to move out to the Big Building in two days. Understand? Oh. If those three weird sisters ask you about this place, tell them nothing. Yes, ma'am. Sir. Sir. Sir? Sir. Are you around here? No swimming tonight? - Good evening, ma'am. - My goodness. You scared me to death. You just popped out. Actually, we've seen each other for two days. I still don't know your name. I'm... Pancake. I'm Taengtong. Taengtong. Nice to meet you. - Have a seat. - Have a seat. What's wrong with Pancake lately? You're right. She doesn't come when we call her. Why don't you text her? She's got a smartphone. That's right. - Do you feel lonely? - Not at all. How about you, Miss Pancake? Is your boyfriend upset when you're flirting with me? I used to have one, but... One day, he asked me to go to his room. I had no idea that... - What's wrong, ma'am? - They text me. Sis, you can't call me right now. She said she's busy. Busy? You're busy, Pancake? - Where were we? - He asked you to go to his room. Into his room. Then he brought me into his room. I couldn't believe what I saw. Over 20 men were standing, naked. After that... - What's wrong? - They text me again. Sis, why do you keep calling me? Bitch. She's busy. Just turn off the phone. Keep interrupting me. I was beaten by them. Guys won't accept a girl like me. Well, do you have a girlfriend? I did have one, and our love was impossible. One night, I was swimming in this pool. Then, suddenly... You've got texts? I got electrocuted and died. You're dead. That means you're a ghost. Excuse me, please go away. I'm scared I will make merit for you. - Miss Pancake? - Yes? You're dead too. Yes. - Let's go to bed. I want some sleep. - Bitch. It's late so you feel sleepy? It's so late and you feel sleepy too? I'm her company. Right. It's late. Let's go to bed, Khoi. Mom, Pancake is with a guy. Have you seen those three old hags that have just moved in? Their faces are too large. It's hard for you to imagine. Picture this. You put those three faces together and it's larger than a football pitch. Damn you, Pancake. You couldn't cope with them. They're horrible, rude, cruel, and tough. You'd better stay away from them. I warn you. Should I expose that bitch? Go. It's raining. You should go inside or you'll catch a cold. You bitch... Where they've gone? Now she can disappear too? - Sis. - What? - We should go to bed. - Go. Go. I'll talk to you later, Pancake. Walk in a line. Don't be scared by me because we're going to stay in the same dorm. Are you guys done? Move faster. What are you babbling about? - Quick. - Those boys are moving out. There must be a reason. Look at those four bitches. They're standing and their faces are just perfectly matched. Looks like a herd of animals. - Am I right, Khoi? - Yes. Am I right, Songkram? Sorry. I forgot that you're deaf. Taengtong. Where are you, Taengtong? I'm coming for you. Taengtong. Where has he gone? I put on a fancy swimsuit for him. Taengtong. - Where are you? - I'm here. You look pretty uptight. No swimming tonight? I put on a swimsuit to swim with you. If you want that, take off my clothes. Really? Pancake! Why does she call me that harshly? - Yes, Sis. - I texted you. You said you're busy. Is this what was keeping you busy? - Mom. - Not now. - Sis. - You ungrateful kid. You're so evil. A slut. A liar. This is a house, not a brothel. You slut. You're such a whore. Always flirting with guys. Slut. Get out of my house. Bad girl. Such a whore. Thank you for calling me a whore. Bitch. I'm so fed up with you. You ungrateful kid. Sis. You smacked my face. I won't say a word. But about telling me to go away, is this your house? You just moved in two days ago. To be precise, you and I moved in at the same time. - Is that right, Khoi? - Yes. You whore. You whore. You whore. Ouch. Ouch. I hurt. - What's wrong? - Pancake. She's into that guy. - She totally ignored us. - Why? She saw me, she scolded me and she hit me too. Why on Earth did she do such a thing, Khoi? - How could she do that? - No. - What? - It's Mom who scolded her and hit her. - What? - You ungrateful child. The guy that Pancake fell for... - What? - He's gorgeous. - What's his name? - He's called Taengtong. Taengtong. Cartoon. Moddam. Are you guys ready? Take it easy, Sis. What's the hurry? No need to rush. I can wait. Mom, where are you going? I'm going to find your new dad, Khoi. Keep your eye on these two. Don't let them interrupt me. Got it? And then you'll get a new dad. - Mom. - What? - You look great tonight. - Just call him Daddy. Taengtong. I'm here, Taengtong. Sis, we're ready. Khoi, where's your mom? My mom said that you two should wait for her in this room. - Go back inside. - Why? I need you to swim with me. Taengtong. You called me? Taengtong, I need you to swim with me. Swimming in a creepy place... I'm ready for it. Brand new. Taengtong. The water is pretty cool. You might catch a cold. Let's go upstairs to my room. Follow me. Is she coming? Taengtong. - Follow me, Taengtong. - Go back. I'll call you if she's here. Let's go to my room. Follow me, Taengtong. I tripped, Taengtong. Follow me. She's coming. Why? Is it a secret? Taengtong. Taengtong. Come with me. Quick. Hey. You might wonder what I'm doing. Taengtong. Here. Come on over. Quick, Taengtong. You ungrateful kid. So evil. A slut. A liar. This is a house, not a brothel. You slut. Always flirting with guys. You're such a whore. Slut. A sex addict. Get out of my house. You're such a whore. Thank you for calling me a whore. Bitch, I'm gonna smack your face. I'm so fed up with you. You ungrateful kid. A whore. That bitch talks trash about you. What an ungrateful spirit. Sis, why do you let her talk to you like that? How dare she behave like this to an old lady? Pancake. Don't worry, Sis. I'll make it right for you. We'll see who he chooses, between me... and me. Mom, do I have a new dad? Just look at me and you'll know it. - Yes? - No. Taengtong. - We'll see who's the one he chooses. - Between a drag queen and a troll. For your selection, Taengtong. Taengtong. Taengtong. Oh my God, you're so hot. How could Pancake say that he's ugly? What's wrong with you people? You keep saying Taengtong. The others do that too. You guys keep calling me all night long. Taengtong, just pick one. Choose one. Your swimsuits look great. You guys are so slutty. Think before you put on your clothes. Let me tell you something. - This man. Can I have him? - Fine. I give up. - Can I call my psychiatrist? - Sure. Not now. Taengtong, do you prefer a lady with a lush body? Moddam, your friend's gone. What are you waiting for? - I haven't had a bite. - Bite me! Fine, my dress is pretty lame tonight. Can't beat the bikinis. That's a real eyesore. How could a toad like her wear those? You look like a dead toad. Nobody in his right mind would wear that outfit. - What did you say? - I said, you in that bikini... - is stunning. - Bullshit. I understand what you said. - You know that? - Bitch. Are you alright? Are you upset? - I am. - More than I was? - So upset. - Let's go, all three of us. Let's cry together... all three sisters. Don't put on a thong ever again, will you? I don't like it. I will get your robe. Come. - It's time to hold a rite. - It should be. Quiet. I'm summoning here. He's gone. Where is he? - He's gone. - Why did you summon me here? Shit. - Why are you here, Takaidao? - Can I join you? I'm scared. I'll kick your face. I'll handle him. Go and grab the savage mole from him. - You mean them, right? - I mean you. - I'm busy. I'm holding something. - Hurry up. I'm scared. He hit me. Let him do it. You'd better take that mole off quickly. Hurry up. - Quick. - I'm hurt. You're not the one he hit. Yeah. On the count of three, I'll pull it out and run away. - Fine. - One. Two. Three. - He hit me again. - Did that hurt? Can't you see? My face is swelling. How about this? You know the drill, - you take it off. - Should I? You should. Hear me out. On the count of three, I'll run away. You ready? One. Two. - Run. - Where's my three? Count it yourself, asshole. Why did you kick me? That's Suanswart. I'll get you. Why did you kick me? Mom. Mom. Why did Ms. Waewswart come into the dorm? Right. Right, my ass. I'm asking you. - There must be something. - Right. - I have nothing to do with you. - But I have. I don't. My face is swelling like hell. You can't just beat me. Beat them. I gotta run. I'm busy. You want to scare me? You're not scared by me? - Boo. - Boo. You're gonna suck my blood for real? Good news. I did a checkup. The lymph in my blood is not good. If you insist, take him. Just go. I'll handle him. You wanna suck my blood? Come and get it. How could he do this to you? Ms. Waewswart got hurt too. Right. Look at my face. It's swelling like a balloon. - So big. - My face? Your boobs. Asshole. I was born with big boobs. Suantwarn. We need backup. I can't take it. I look like a monkey. Two friends of mine are so good at casting spells. We need them now. I guarantee you that they will win. Karakade. A ghost! Go away. - You don't recognize Taengtong? - Who are you? I don't recognize you. Get out! Ouch! Ouch! I haven't seen you for ages. Why is your nose flat like that? My nose has always been flat like this. Get out. Help me. - Taengtong. Are you alright, flat nose? - It's Karakade. What did you do to Karakade? Thanks. - You! - Oh. Ouch! Don't hurt Khoi, Taengtong. - You recognize Taengtong? - No. You said that yourself. - Don't hurt Kiddo. - It's Khoi. - Don't hurt Khoi. - Don't strangle Khoi too hard. Where is everyone? Why is it so quiet here? Whatever. We'll see who is Taengtong's pick, between you guys and me. - Taengtong. - Taengtong. - Golden dick. - Come, Taengtong. They call me every night. Act like they're my wives. - Taeng... - Stop. Come, Taengtong. Old dogs keep barking. You call us dogs? Bitch. - I'll get you. - What're you doing here? - Who are you? - Bitch. Whore. - I know. - That guy's wife. - Who are you? - Bitch. I see. You're Pancake. Shit. Who are you? You jerk! You can't hit me. Let me hit you first. Got it? Here. Well, asshole. I just want to smack your face. Why can't I? I'll get you. Oh, no, Taengtong. See? He picks me. He comes to me first. Oh, no. Don't kiss me. My friends are jealous of me. - Right? - Look at that. I've got chills. It's not right. He's gonna eat me. Mom. Mom. He strangled my dick. What? My neck. Why is he so savage? He's gone. I'm so relieved. It hurts all over my body, like I've been beaten. I ran, so I've lost one of my stockings. That's not my big toe. This is my foot, of course. This one is not mine. Why is it not tickling? Dear Lord... Go away. Leave me alone. - Go to somewhere else. - Where can I go now? - I don't know. Just go. - I will stay right here. Dear Lord, don't you find me. Taengtong. We've gone beyond the bed. - What're you laughing at? - Laugh, my ass. I'm crying. Taengtong. You wanna suck my blood? Pancake. You want to rip me apart? Do it. I'm exhausted. I can fight you guys no more. What are you doing? You are really annoying. You are so happy seeing your lover. I am alone, all by myself. So exhausting and tiring. Stop it. She passed out. I cannot fall asleep, I am so mad. I am going mental. She's talking in her sleep? Enough. You scared me. He can't come in. Who's that? Who? Is that you, Cartoon? Come in and close the door. - Close it. - Close it. Oh. Locked. Sis Taew, let me out with you. - It's a small space. - Sis Taew, why are you so mean? - You are a mean sister. - What? - Won't you let me out? - Or what? You can't come inside. - What? - Stay there. - Serves you right. - Cartoon. You are a mean sister. Oh, Taengtong. Why are you here? I'm taking a shower. I'm taking a shower. Gosh. What are you looking at? I'm a lady. You should be a gentleman. Soap. How do you know that I prefer a bar of soap? Can you rub it on my back for me? I can't reach it. Rub it. Yeah, like that. Your hand is so strong, Taengtong. What? Pancake? How dare you put your foot on my back? If you mess with my man, I'm gonna rub it on your face too. Bitch. Why do you get all the spotlight? - Sis, get out. - You evil spirit. I'll go, bitch. You... Oops! Listen, you and I will sort this out. - Who closed the door? - You didn't open it, dumbass. - You did this to me? - Your saliva is all over me. You're such a cow. Calling me a cow? So lame. Don't you know the water bill is pricey? She's gone. Mom, Taengtong is standing right behind you. - I don't know how he get there. He grins... - What? What did you say? I don't get it. How can you stay here? I'm talking to my son. Why don't you go inside? How can you come out here? What are you talking about? - How can you be right here? - Taengtong, bite her neck. Don't... - He can't. - Taengtong, bite her neck. Do it. Do it, Taengtong. Bite me. Wow. Khoi. Hey, Khoi. - Hold on. Grab me. - Sis. Yeah, Pancake. Take that. Be careful, Mom. Wow. Come and bite me. Let's see where you can go now. - What will you do, Pancake? - I will let Taengtong bite your neck. I'm Sis Taew, you know? Khoi. Pancake, my balls. Pancake. Khoi. Pancake. Don't do this to me. You think you'll make it? He's climbing after me. Sis, I'm just kidding. Good job. Go swimming every day. My Khoi will get stronger. Don't forget to flip back. Backstroke, good. So people can see your dick. It's a must. Mom, what's a mug? - I'm not. - It's a must. Oh, a must. I've got an accent. Auntie. What's the matter, Nymph? - My name is Karakade. - What's up, Karakade? - I have something to tell you. - Say it. There are just three of us. Well, I... Karakade. He called you. What? Hey, girl. You say nothing. Hey, what's up? Girl. Go back... what? Khoi. My Khoi. Khoi is drowning. Oh, Khoi is diving... to the pool's bottom. What is it, son? I found treasure there. Treasure can't be in a pool. You're so dumb. Who's your father? He must be so stupid. But I'm your mom, so let me see it. What is it? Let me see. Hey, this is a talisman. Moddam. Cartoon. A talisman. What talisman? Khoi found it at the bottom of the pool. Right. I took it off. It must be a talisman for keeping someone's spirit there. What? The talisman we used to keep Taengtong's spirit. - They took it off. Shit. - That's right. Taengtong will go wild all over the place. That's right. - Will he come here? - Definitely. Hey, you guys. You think Taengtong will be here? He's not coming. Just go to sleep. - I don't care if he's here. - Why? Here. I've got holy garlic, imported from Romania. - Not from Bon Marche market? - Bitch. I ordered it from Romania. Your joke is so lame. Go to bed. Sleep tight. Sleep well. Go to sleep. Why are you here? - I came to see you. - I didn't let you. - I miss you. - I don't miss you. Ms. Waewswart? Look. You're scared by my cross-shaped hairdo. It's not all I've got. I have something so cool. Here. Do you know what it is? Garlic from Romania. I gotcha. Here. Oh, they're worms. Waewswart, worms are all over my face. I'm your boss, bitch. Don't come any closer. Here. I have garlic. Are you scared? This is holy garlic. You're not scared at all? What are you gonna do to me?

Then, who's the one we saw? Who's that woman we saw? Hey. WAEWSWART MIRUELEUM 11 AUGUST 2510 - 7 AUGUST 2543 We've got company. Hurry. Hey, Waewswart. Finally, this mansion is mine. Only mine. You know, don't be jealous of me. Waewswart. Waew. Don't you dare trick me. - I see. - That's right. I knew it. You guys, keep it secret. Tell no one. - Right. - Got it, Khoi? - Let's go. - To where? In that coffin perhaps? I mean outside. Do you have anything to tell us, Karakade? - No. - I think you have. That's why you keep following us around. Karakade, who killed Taengtong? I don't know. I can't remember anything. - What should we do now? - Oh. - Huh? - I... I just know that there were two people who killed Taengtong. When I saw them, they grabbed my head and smacked it - over and over so my nose got broken. - That's why you've got a flat nose. It's not natural. Right. I used to be very pretty. Then I couldn't remember anything. Oh, dear. You've lost all your memories. - But... - What? I can't really remember anything. Do you have any idea - who sent this letter to us? - I have no idea. You guys want to know what's inside? Read it. Don't look at me. Read it. Sis. The first time we read it, There was no picture. We saw only letters. - Where's this picture come from? - Hello. I'm Pakakrong. Help me. Help me. Sis Taew, Moddam and Cartoon. I'm so scared. There's a murder at Maison la Dolce Vita. Just die. You die. Let me use your identity. Fake Waewswart killed the real Waewswart. She kills everyone who knows her secret. Serves you right. Nosy bitch. - Are you talking to me? - To her. Fine. You had it coming. - Waewswart and Suanswart. - How can you come in here? You're so evil. I can't believe you can kill people. I won't stay here with you. You're so cruel. - I will be a nun. - Huh? Be a nun. - Pee? The loo's over there. - No. Be a nun. - A nun, in white dress and hairless. - What? I will be a nun. I've said it too many times. You are so dumb. - Why do you call me dumb? - I'm leaving. Help me. Now you know who sent you that letter. It's you. I think this is the best spot to summon that spirit. L and Gluta, let's go.

Right. - We must help Taengtong. - Our Golden Dick. - Hey. - He belongs to us. He's my man. Well... Look. They're having fun. Suantwarn. These stupid bitches made a mistake again. Sis. If it weren't for those two, I could have done it. Dumbass. Those two are the ones you're supposed to destroy. Oh, shit. But Gluta and L-carnitine know a lot of spells. Stop it. That is the spell for summoning a spirit. Oh. Oh, shit. Why don't you just sit on me? Is it necessary to be this close? I've got an idea about this. A friend of mine is really good at casting spells. He also has a pack of wolves. Vampires don't like werewolves. Have you ever seen the Twinglight movies? - It's called Twilight. - Right. Twilight. Eclipse.
