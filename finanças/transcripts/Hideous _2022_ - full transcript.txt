Do you sometimes feel like you're being swallowed by the mist? Driven like our heroin into a more obscure, silent yet deafening land? This is a journey of hell, fear, strange debauchery and guilt that most people call the life. Can you take it? Can you deal with your own ghouls and spectres? Don't move from your seats or coffins: in one hour sharp, your favourite TV host Seth Lamoor will be gracing your screens. Joined by guest Oliver Sim to discuss his first solo release… I should be stronger than this I should have a handle on it I know all of the tricks The crudest magic Yet every step that I get closer I can watch your eyes notice As I slip into focus But somewhere from a distance Did I fool you into thinking I was a Confident man Confident man Confident confident man Somewhere from a distance Did I fool you into thinking? Somewhere from a distance Did I fool you into thinking? Oli you told me about a… a dark heart. What is that? I know it was created from fear. Fear of being different, fear of being judged. Fear of others… If you could visualize this fear, this inner monster. What would it look like? It takes so many faces. It can be merely a monstrous child crying out for help. Or it can be as big and powerful as a werewolf. But most of the time it's just lost in the mist. With no goals and sad eyes. Okay, wow. Talking about your fears, how long have you been dealing with them? I think they've always been here. But I had a happy childhood, loving family. Can I just say your outfit is in-credible. I imagine you always had this kind of taste? I mean can you describe yourself as a child? I think my Mum would describe it as I wasn't part of the football crowd. All that meant was I didn't play football with the other boys. I was maybe a bit more sensitive. - But I was definitely a femme kid - Hey sweetie. And that is something I loved about myself, felt like my superpower. I was obsessed with female rage. Whether be Ripley in Alien or Carrie or Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween. - Women that could be feminine and sexy - What are you watching? - But still… powerful and strong. - I feel like it's me. All things I wanted to be but maybe didn't feel like I could be. Did you feel like you could share that with anyone? At home yeah. I lived in a house full of strong women. My mum, my sister. I could make dance routines in the living room, I could be as femme as I wanted to be at home. It was my castle. What does your bedroom look like? Could you describe your childhood bedroom? My room was equal parts little boy, equal parts hand-me-downs from my sister. I used to watch horror VHS's all the time. But at the same time I had… this beautiful pink mic that I loved. I was obsessed with space so my wallpaper was filled with stars and planets. I had dinosaurs. I can vividly remember this giant teddy bear near to my bed. He would protect me from all my imaginary monsters I could see from my window whilst I was trying to sleep. And this terrifying mask with feathers on it. I used it to dress up as the terrors I watched on my TV. If you could meet yourself as a kid right now, what would you say? Far too fem Surrounded by rocks You're gonna look the gem You can dress it away Talk it away Dull down the flame But it's all pretend It's all pretend What would my… What would my father do? Do I take a bite Take a bite of the fruit? I've heard other people say It can't be right if it cause you shame Have I made you proud Take a look at me now If I've got my father's eyes I've got my mother's smile Wrong or right You're standing right in front of a green light Just look at his face What a beautiful face How it makes you feel inside Take a bite babe Take a bite babe It's an ordinary thing Take a bite babe Take a bite babe It's an ordinary thing What would my father do? Do I take a bite Take a bite of the fruit? Have I made you proud Take a look at me now If I've got my father's eyes I've got my mother's smile Have I made you proud Take a look at me now If I've got my father's eyes I've got my mother's smile Hey, hey come here. What a fucking freak! He looks so weird. Shit. I'm ugly I'm up and down right now I'm down and bloody But I don't feel as though I've been unlucky I have people in my life that really love me Caught my reflection in your eye Now you've seen me from both sides Am I hideous? My tears naturally dry On exposure to the light Am I hideous? Oh, I Hide Though the company at home can be unkind Yet I live alone and refuse to go outside How dare I feel so lonely When I'm giving all my time To a man who doesn't know me Why don't you leave me in the dirt I've been sick and I'm perverse Oh, I'm hideous If I've had you at your worst It was easy in return Oh, I'm hideous Follow my voice Sweet nature boy Just to keep you safe Listen for me Be brave Have trust Just be willing to be loved Radical honesty might set me free If it makes me hideous Been living with HIV Since seventeen Am I hideous?
