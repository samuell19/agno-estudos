It got me thinking. What if I time travel back in time as my 28-year-old self, and I found my 10-year-old self and I fucking jerked him off. Would that be molestation or masturbation? I don't got time for your nonsense. I'm too busy being employee of the month. Hey you two. Quit giving each other FJs and get back to work. Idiots.

I can't just go talk to her. This is a workplace. Who cares? I'm so tired of listening to you cry about not having a girl to cuddle with. Who cares? Uh, how about title seven of the Civil Rights Act. Uh, how do you know that? Are you fucking kidding me? It's in the break room. And you know what happens to people accused of sexual harassment? What, they hold a parade for them? Termination. Dude, they're not gonna fire you for talking to her. Just go over there before she leaves. Stop being a little bitch. I'll buy you a beer after work. Make it two? Fine, just go. Dick. Nice files you got there. Do you work here? Seriously? I've worked here longer than you. Oh, so you're in like shipping and receiving? What? No, I work right here in this office. I was sitting at my desk when you walked in. You didn't see me? Really? Yeah, I didn't see you. You didn't see me? I was like two inches away from you. And how do you not know I work here? I see you every single day. Wait, so you've been watching me? Like some kind of perverted stalker. You know that's sexual harassment? Sexual harassment? For seeing you come in? Maybe you should take yourself on down to the break room and get a refresher course because that's not sexual harassment. Hmm. What's up, Jenna? Oh, hey, Matt. Seriously? We actually have to go, I'm sorry. Alex is having a family emergency. How the hell does Jenna know who you are and not me? I don't know. Maybe because I'm not a perverted stalker. Well if it isn't the two biggest vaginas in the office. I knew I'd find you two in here circle jerking each other. So we have vaginas, or we're jerking each other's dicks off? I'm confused. Both. You fucking gender ninjas. You know what, fuck you, I got shit to do. What the hell, man? You gonna do something about it, pussy? That's what I thought. (CALM JAZZY MUSIC) (FAINT ROCK MUSIC) Oh, you got to be fist fucking me, man. What now? Oh nothing, I'm just having PTSD flashbacks, you know, remembering that time you were talking to Jenna at the office. Made yourself look like a dumb idiot. Remember that? Fuck off. I don't understand how you're so horrible at talking to women. It's like watching one of those shitty Novelas. All Novelas are shitty, and you wouldn't have done any better. Fucking right I would have. Compared to you I'm like Zac Efron's cock. Yeah, whatever. If you're so smooth, let's see you do better. Challenge accepted ese. Can I get you guys a refill? Actually, I was wondering if you might possibly know the difference between me and my couch? One's more fun to sit on than the other. Sort of.

I'm sorry I doubted you. Your moms would be so proud. Just wait for it, wait for it. (LOUD WHOOSH) Ah, snap. Told you. You probably know her. Ah, come on, I wasn't even ready dude. I don't care. Six more shots. (MYSTICAL MUSIC) (VOMITING) Gross, I think you got some on me. You know, I can't even wrap my brain around the fact that you are so horrible at talking to chicks. Look at you, you're like an Abercrombie model over here. You should be banging bitches every single day and every single night and afternoon. Well it's not easy for me to talk to women like it is for you. I'm not surrounded by a hot girlfriend and hot stripper moms 24/7 who wipe the tip of my penis every time I take a piss. Fuck you dude. I told you a million times, my mom is not a stripper, she's an exotic dancer and a saint. And I don't even want to hear this shit, man. Look at you. I would give both nuts and the sack to have your life. You can run a billion miles, you get to wear all this stylish clothes, and most of all, you're not smothered like I am.

Did you see where I put my phone? I need to call my mom. She's probably worried about me. Alex. Yo, I need to let her know I spent the night at your house. The fuck? Am I high right now? I don't remember doing any drugs last night. Ah. What? Nice bike, fat ass. I'm surprised your tires haven't exploded. Good one, Vir-Gina. We have the same bike dumb-ass. It's Virgil, asshole and I don't have that faggy basket. Why don't you take your bitch ass back home before I shit on Matt's porch again, blame you and watch your whore of a mom whoop your ass. No, I won't put my hands down your pants and play with your tiny dick. Leave me alone, Jared from Subway. Hey man, you get away from that kid. Tiny dick. Oh shit. (DOOR BELL RINGING) I fucking knew it, dude, get out of my way. What the hell is going on, dude? Why am I in your Ethiopian body? I don't know, why don't you tell me?

I find it and honor to resemble Jabba Desilijic Tiure. One of the most notorious crime lords in the galaxy. The hell are you talking about? Jabba Desilijic Tiure aka Jabba the Hutt or the Bloated one. Seriously? First introduced in 1983 with the third installment of the original Star Wars trilogy, Return of the Jedi. No? Got the little Ewoks, they look like little George Lucas's. I swear, sometimes you're the smartest mentally handicap person that I know. Is there a god damn reason why my AC's not on right now? My balls are sweaty and they're like sticking to my ankles. What are you talking about? It's freezing in here. Your nipples are fucking hard as fuck right now. Yeah. So what are we gonna do? You figure out what switched us yet? I'm thinking. Well think faster you're the smart one. Will you shut the hell up? I'm trying to concentrate. Jesus. Okay. So we went to work. We stopped by the bar afterward. You puked like a little bitch. Obviously the bum. The one that slapped us. It had to be him. Oh yeah, right. That mother fucker. Well let's go find him and make him switch us back. Come on. Skedaddle. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) Oh, come on! (HORN HONKS) Dude, we crashed. What the fuck? Did you hit someone? Dude, pay attention. I'm not gonna be the only one looking for this guy, okay. (ASIAN THEMED MUSIC) MATT: Oh shit, Kratos. You know that guy? Ah, yeah, he's my dealer. I told you about him before. No. Come on. He probably knows that fuck that slapped us. (SCREAMING) What the fuck's is this guy's problem? Just pretend like you're me. Kratos, it's me Matt. I buy pot from you homebroski. Calm down. This is my friend Ma... This is my friend Alex. I know who you are. You think you could steal Matt's face and then come up on my corner and deal drugs? What? I knew about your machine. Takes someone's face and then puts on someone else's. We didn't steal anybody's face. We just came here to ask you a question about one of your friends. How do you know about my friends? I don't got any bum friends. Now get out of here. This is my empire. You can't have it. Kratos, look into my eyes, man. It's me Matt. My buddy Alex and I were here last night when some bum who walks around with his hands down his pants caressing his nuts, slapped both of us in the face. And by some weird voodoo or magic or some shit, we switched bodies. He's me and I'm him. And we just want to switch and get our own bodies back. Now can you help us? Matt, my man. Why didn't you tell me in the first place, my brotha? (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) Not this guy again. I see you've met Joe Blow. Is he sucking his own dick? Lucky bastard. Ah, what the hell man? Get off of me. I am so sorry. Hey, Kratos. This is Steve. He's been diagnosed with this rare disease called Alien Hand Syndrome. He's got no control over his right arm. I told him it's proof that aliens exist, and I offered to cut it off. But he won't let me. Do you guys know the bum we're talking about or what? Yeah, I know about the guy you're looking for. His name's Magic Mike. He comes around every Friday to get the recyclables before the garbage comes. Is he jerking you off right now? Just go with it, bro. I think we got the answers we're looking for. Hey wait. Don't you guys want to buy something? I just got in some real goodies. No man, we're good. Oh. Oh, god. Oh. I am so sorry. I'm not. (ENGINE REVVING) I cannot believe I'm gonna be stuck in this body tonight. Bitch please. You get to eat snacks and play Xbox while my mom and girlfriend spoil you. And why in the hell would I do that? MATT: Because you're me. So? So we have to pretend like we're each other. What, why? Seriously? You honestly think anyone besides my drugged out dealer is gonna believe us if we tell them we switched bodies? I'm gonna go with no. They're more likely to lock us away in some creepy asylum. You know I hate asylums. I guess you have a point. You're fucking right I do. Fine, whatever. Lets just get this over with man. Shit, Holly's already here. What's the protocol on that anyway? If she comes on to me, do I hit that or? She's definitely gonna come on to you and you're not gonna do a damn thing. You're gonna shut that shit down. Whatever it takes. I understand it's been a while since you felt a woman's touch, but you better not do anything man. All right, all right. Jesus, calm down. What's this? That is your itinerary for the week. I don't even know what half these exercises are. And raw foods? You know I'm not gonna eat this shit, right? You are gonna eat that shit or Holly's gonna be eating this dick.

(MOANING) (DOOR BELL RINGING) I need to answer the door, okay? What the fuck do you think you're doing, dude? What? Don't what me. I saw you grabbing her dick. Her grabbing your dick. You know what the fuck I meant. She was grabbing your dick actually, and she was the one all over me. Whatever, just give me the damn car keys. You're a real asshole, you know that? I'm telling you the truth. It wasn't me, it was Action Jackson. Yeah, I'm gonna eat real healthy all right. (ENGINE REVVING) Do you have any sixes? No. I mean go fish. Okay. Do you have any jacks? Yep. You know, we should really switch this to strip go fish. No, I think we should stick to the regular go fish. Please. (COUGHING) What the fuck, motha fucka? Did you just talk? Fuck yeah, I said what the fuck? Alex tries to fuck your girl and you're just gonna eat a fucking pizza? Bitch move motha fucka. Yeah, well what the fuck do you suggest then, asshole?

Puke it up or I'm gonna make you puke it up. (VOMITS) Now clean yourself off. (TOILET FLUSHING) (CALM MUSIC) So you really didn't diddle my girl? No, like I said, she ambushed me. She fucking jumped on me. I had to fight just to get away. It's not my fault your body is so irresistibly sexy. And you haven't been doing anything since I left? Hell no. We've just been playing go fish like two real mature adults. Man, Holly always kicks my ass at that game. Yeah, that's 'cause you suck. Oh yeah, I made you a new itinerary. How about you try following it this time, instead of throwing it away. I'm not gonna throw it away. Yeah, like you didn't throw away the crinkled up one I found in your driveway. Can you wash that shit off my face so I don't break out with pimples? And please, please for the love of god, will you stop eating junk food while you're in my body. Can you do that? Fine. Bitch. (ALARM RINGING) (YAWNS) Best night of sleep, ever. Good morning my little astronaut. You forgot to put your sleep mask on again last night so I put it on you while you were asleep. I wish you would've told me Ms. Gaye. This damn thing freaks me out. (LAUGHING) Ms. Gaye? Very funny, Matty. What's that? What's what? Oh, nothing, I thought I saw a ghost. Queeri.

Can't believe we have a sold out show today. Although I'm not a fan of your health care plan I do appreciate President Obama for coming to see me. Speaking of health, I obviously have none. Will you at least pretend to work while you're me? I don't have time for that. You do realize that the comedy contest is in a few days, right? Yes. And do you realize there's a big chance we'll still be in each other's bodies by then? Fuck, you're right. Well then, you're just gonna have to do the contest for me. Nope. No. No no no no. I didn't sign up for that bullshit. You're gonna have to cancel. I don't do big crowds. Besides, you can re-enter next year anyway. Get over yourself you damn drama queen. You do presentations all the time at work and you seem to do just fine. There's a huge difference. There's only a handful of people who actually work here, most of them we hate. When I'm doing presentations I'm not attempting to make a huge crowd laugh. What if I freeze? Or they hate me? I'm not trying to make a fool out of myself. Relax, if anything you'll be making a fool out of me. I already given you my body, my secret weapon. Now here are the bullets. My material. Read it, live it, be it. I really don't think I can do this. How about this, you stop being a smelly clit and do this competition for me and I'll get you a date with Jenna. I'll get her all wet and juicy for you so when we switch and get our bodies back all you have to do is slip the tip right in. Yeah. How does that sound? Give your hand a night off for once. It's a little graphic, but enticing. How about this? You get me the date with Jenna while staying in shape until I get my body back. I actually have a respectable competition coming up. It's called a triathlon. You probably have no clue what that is considering it involves physical exercise but you're gonna need to learn, because you're probably gonna have to do it for me. All right, and if you help shed a few pounds, I think we can seal this deal. Come on, man. Hey you two retards, quit finger diddling each other's urethras and get back to work. Alex, I need you to start with this and then, I said Alex. And then get back to your other tasks. What is this? Is this cocaine? (SNORTS) If anyone asks, I was with you two fucktards last night. Hey boss, hanging out with that white girl, huh? Classy, classy, I would partake but I'm currently doing a full body cleanse. I love those scrumptious shakes. If you mention white girl or say the word scrumptious again, I'll fucking kill you. Now get back to work. There's shit smeared all over the bathroom walls again. It was me. I wasn't done with that. Look at these two anus clowns blowing each other's dicks like animal balloons. You do know they don't actually blow on your dick when you get a blowjob, right? Have you ever even gotten head before? No shit, I've had literally millions of blow jays in my life. You mean blowgays? We don't have time for your shit today Chad, so fuck off. Where did you get the balls to step up to me, civilian? You have no idea the shit I saw over there. (GUNS FIRING) (GROANING) You're not even close to being on my level you little bitch. I used to laugh at weak ass chumps like you in boot camp. Yeah? Did you laugh at yourself when they booted your bitch ass out of boot camp? That's right. I know all about your Swiss cheese heart full of holes. So why don't you and your faulty heart murmur the fuck out of here. Yeah, look at Mr. Big shot over here, huh. Fuck you and fuck you. Jesus, you know I got you guys this job? I can fire you too. I'm actually the one that got you this job. And you can't fire us, you're a janitor. I'm a fucking custodian level two. There's a difference ass hat. What is this? I'm getting it from both sides now? You want some? No, I'm just saying I got you the job. Whatever, I have to go. Apparently I'm the only one who actually works around here.

What the fuck did I just watch? (OBJECTS SHUFFLING AND CLANGING) Hey fellas, don't you hate it when you're watching porn and jerking off. Everything is going perfectly. The woman is beautiful. She's moaning loud because the guy is pounding her like some insane centaur. You're close to shooting out your cum sprinkles when out of nowhere the angle of the video takes a turn for the worse. You're suddenly in a very non flattering angle for straight people. You know what I'm talking about. The angle behind the dude where absolutely zero of the girl is showing. All you see is a hairy back and ass crack with sweaty manballs bouncing up and down. Who directed this thing? This was not what I signed up for. Talk about a jizz killer. Yep, there's no way I'm getting this down in time. Babe, what are you doing? Have you forgotten about our annual camping trip of love? Uh, no, why would I forget something that important? Uhm, remind me what made it so awesome last year? Oh, last year was amazing. (ROMANTIC MUSIC) (SQUISHY IMPACT) (GROANING) You were so romantic. I love spending time with you by the lake just eating junk food. Making love under the stars. Having you to myself for three days. Grrrr. It'll be amazing. Uh, I'm just gonna forewarn you this year might be a little bit different. I'm not feeling like myself. What up mother fuckers? And welcome to another segment of E Zee Doez it on a Budget. I'm your host E Zee and if you're watching this you're probably hungry or just fucking high. Either way, let's get this shit started. Today I'm gonna be teaching you how to make Ghetto S'ghetti. And for all those haters out there leaving bullshit comments on my feed below, you can go fuck yourselves. Especially you RashelleRay24 and GordonGramsy62. I will find you, and when I do, I'm gonna beat the shit out of you with your own fucking keyboards. So remember, words don't leave marks, but keyboards do. Hot dog, I'm high as shit. What you will need for this deliciously cheap ass meal is a packet of ramen noodles including the spices, a package of hotdogs, and last but not least a bottle of ketchup or Sriracha for you weird mexi chinks out there. Ewh, gross. So now what you're gonna want to do is open up your noodle packet and set it in the bowl. Now it's time to set you noodles in the microwave for five minutes. Seriously, how did this weird bitch open the package so fast? Excuse me? Excuse me? Excuse me? Who the fuck are you calling weird you fugly ass nerd? Are you talking to me? Yeah asshole, I am. Maybe if you didn't have bitch arms you could open the fucking package yourself. Well my hands are kind of sweaty. Here you go retard. What the fuck? How did you? (MICROWAVE BEEP) Oh yeah! The noodles are done. Now's the time that you're gonna wanna strain that water. Do you still need this? Thanks fucker. Take this and just add that shit. Now's the time that you're gonna add your ketchup. Or Sriracha. And just get it all up in there. Mix it together and then add your hotdogs. Bon appetit. And there you have it. Ghetto S'ghetti. Be sure to tell me how fucking terrible this recipe is, along with all my other ones in the comments below. You sacks of shit with no fucking lives. Maybe I should stop smoking weed... Huh, nah. Stupid. Awh, holy mother of god. (SPITS) That is disturbingly gross. I miss my mommy's cooking. (UNEASY MUSIC) Oh, Jesus. I just wanted to give you your second bag of brownies. Are you okay? You seem distracted? Uh, yeah. I'm fine. I'm so glad we finally get some alone time together. You've been avoiding me a lot lately. Tonight though you're all mine. Momma wants some of that anaconda you're packing. Hey, hey, stop it with that lady! Geez. And let's be realistic here, it's more like a baby garden snake if anything. Besides, I told you I'm just not feeling up to it tonight. What's going on? Are you not attracted to me anymore? Don't be sad. It's not you I promise. Work's stressing me out. I got this comedy show coming up I'm not prepared for, like at all. I'm just having stupid man problems, okay? I promise I'll have lots and lots of crazy sex with you soon. And you'll put it in my butt too? Uh. Yeah. If you get like a million enemas first. Come on, let's go back to the tent. Those brownies are definitely gonna hit you soon. Wait, what? Hit me?

Matt, I've told you this over and over. When will you get it through that thick sexy skull of yours? It doesn't matter what you look like, even though I think you're sexy as hell.

My clothes are still on and the arm floats. Come on, we didn't really do anything. Did we? Well you just whipped out Action Jackson and went at it. I went at it? Bullshit. You drugged and raped me. I should've known you were lying. Nobody mixes shrooms with weed, that doesn't even make any sense. You roofied me didn't you? I wasn't giving it up, you decided to roofie rape me. That's what happened. The fuck is that? See, I was fucking right. The fuck! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Good morning, mom. The fuck are you doing here? Wait... Did we...

I'm on a camping trip with the sexiest man alive. No cell service, so leave a message and I'll get back to you when I have a signal. You know, unless we're eaten by bears. Roar. Bye. The trip was today? SHANIQUA: (KNOCKS ON DOOR) Hey, Alex. Everything all right this morning? Yeah. Now fuck off, Shaniqua. Are those fucking JNCOs? Fuck yeah. Dope, right? Wait, what the hell are you doing? Don't worry about me, just getting rid of evidence from something I'll never speak of ever again. So did you and my girlfriend have fun on our very, very romantic anniversary trip? Yeah, we just, it was really boring actually. We just stayed up all night and she talked about how awesome you are. I disagreed of course. And then we fell asleep, very, very far away from each other. Wow, after last night... This situation is obviously pretty crazy. That, mixed with the fact that Holly is so fucking sexy. She can't resist my handsome mug. I know fighting her off must be hard. So thank you. Uhm, you're welcome... I guess it kinda has been pretty hard. Like I said, thanks. I really apprec... Hey babe, why'd you storm out? Oh hey Alex. Did you fuck my girlfriend? Did you? Did you mother fucker? Did you fuck my future wife and mother of my unborn children? Will you stop it. Oh, you want me to stop? Like how you stopped yourself from fucking my girlfriend? You're going to burn your own body over an accident? Why not? I'll go kamikaze to take you out. And please, elaborate, how does one go about accidentally fucking someone? Huh? Will you- Will you knock it off? Last night was the worst night of my life. You don't even understand, dude. I'm not getting into any details ever, but I guarantee my night was way worse than yours. No, my night was worse. I promise you. And I swear I didn't plan or even remember what happened last night. I put that on my mother. You don't have a real mom to swear on. We both know your real mom dropped you off at some ghetto ass foster home because she couldn't possibly love a piece of shit like you. You're a real funny guy, Matt. Thank you. No, you're all fun and games, that's your problem. You sit on your fat fucking ass all day while your moms and your girlfriend do everything for you. You have no motivation at all, you haven't even made one grown up decision in your entire life. You've only been in my body for a few days and you've already gained weight, god only knows what you've done to my lungs with all that shit that you smoke. Oh, you're one to talk about motivation. You've barely even practiced my stand up and the contest is in two days. You're going to either not show up or choke like you always do when you talk to anyone else besides me. There's a reason you have no real family or friends. It's because you have a shitty personality. And the only reason I've tolerated you all this time is because I felt sorry for you. I don't need you. You're literally the most annoying fucking person in the entire world. And now that I'm stuck in this fat fucking disgusting body I can't comprehend why you haven't fucking killed yourself yet. And the reason why I haven't practice your stand up is because your material fucking blows. You are not funny! (GASPS) You take that back you son of a bitch. Nope, I put it out there. I set it free. And besides, it's not like it news to anyone anyway, bitch. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Yeah, walk away pussy. (SCREAMING) Hah hah. You okay? I realize that a bottle to the face may not have been the best idea but, you did say I wasn't funny. (SCREAMS) (GRUNTING) Get off him, you're hurting him. Oh, fuck. I'm sorry babe, are you okay? I didn't mean to. Get off me, Alex. Babe, are you okay? Did he hurt you? You know, you only had one friend. You slept with my girlfriend so now you have zero friends. Unless you have information on how to switch us back I don't want to hear shit from you. And once we do figure this whole thing out, I'll really be done with you for good. What's going on? Nothing. It's complicated. Is there someone else? No, it's just you, Holly, I promise. You're lazy. You can't make any grown up decisions. Yeah, okay. You won't be saying that when I kick the shit out of this bitch ass triathlon. Bonjour, you are a disgusting fat American. (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) You are weak. You are fat. (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) You remind me of my wife, ugly and stiff. (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) I bet if there was a cheeseburger you'd make it to the end. (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) What is this? You think you are pretty? You are a hippopotamus. Look at your fat ass. Get out of here. (KIAI SHOUT) Get out of my sight. Get out of here. Get out of here. Don't be a fat American. Call me, I will make you skinny. About to step up my game today. Talk about a jizz killer. What. MISS GAYE: Honey bunny, I made your third round of breakfast, come and get it. Not right now, mom, I'm working on something. I'm a real man. I got this. I won't choke. Seriously, I thought he had a smart fridge. Isn't this shit supposed to refill itself? Where the hell is this trainer guy? I've been waiting for minutes. Man, maybe paying over the phone wasn't such a good idea. You know what? Fuck this. I don't need anyone's help. I can do this myself. (POWERFUL MOTIVATIONAL MUSIC) What the fuck? It's called a tomato, fat American. Get the fuck away from me you crazy fuck. And this is called a banana. (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) I think jizzing for me is a lot like when I sneeze. Uhm, once I start I can't stop and it usually happens out of nowhere and very quickly. And I also look funny as hell because I'm making weird faces like, awh. How was that? Well it's great babe if you could just maybe loosen up a little bit. Yeah, I mean, like it's good. But you're really tense right now. Thank you. (POWERFUL MOTIVATIONAL MUSIC) (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Hey ladies and ladies, here's a fun fact about me. If you're not man or a family member there's a small tiny part of me that wants to fuck you. (ALL LAUGHING) And that small and tiny part of me, it's called my penis. I don't know why you're laughing, you're my girlfriend. (POWERFUL MUSIC) Hey little piggie. Swim fat American piggie. I'm not even fat anymore asshole. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Just want to say that it is fantastic to be here. I actually just flew into town and boy are my arms tired. From masturbating on the plane. (LAUGHING) It's exhausting. (VOICE DROWNED BY MUSIC) (CLEARS THROAT) Hey, I'm Alex. I mean. Fuck. Hey everybody, I'm Matt and a- Fuck is, fuck you. Piece of shit. Ah damn it. (CLEARS THROAT) All right you got this. You got this. All right everyone, line up. Who's ready to run? (CHEERING) All right, that's what I like to see. Remember, if you believe in it you can achieve it. I wanna see some hustle today. On your marks. Get set. Go. (GUNSHOT) What are you doing? Basically what I'm trying to say is, you know I'm still horny from last night. So after the show if you want to have some horrible sex, come find me. (CROWD LAUGHING) Thank you. (CROWD APPLAUDING) Good job man, good job. Good job. Give it up one more time guys for Kyle. (CROWD APPLAUDING) Your next person coming to the stage is Matt Gaye. Don't be a pussy. You fucking got this. Matt Gaye, to the stage. Oh fuck, fuck, fuck. Okay. Matt Gaye, you out there buddy? Oh, are you, are you Matt? You can come up this way. Okay. Hello every... Hello everybody. Hello. Hi. Okay. Uh, so... One tiny fact you might know about me. That you probably don't know about me. I mean, I mean why would you know, we haven't had sex, or fucked it up, or fucked and sex, so. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) I don't have an above average size penis. Uh. I also don't own an average sized penis. Okay, what I'm trying to say is that, I just, I have a tiny dick, so. (OMINOUS MUSIC) I Another fun fact about me is I thoroughly enjoy masturbating, like a lot. And I've noticed that I jerk off really fast. I'm much like the flash. You can't even see my hand. It's faster than that, I'm just not horny right now, so. This inspired me for a brilliant script that I'm writing right now, it's actually called Whack to the Future. It's action packed. It's starring Tom Hardy and Palmela Handerson. (CROWD LAUGHING) Every time Mr. Hardy finds himself in a sticky situation he runs out to the streets, just jerking off. That's how he looks. And right when he reaches 88 miles per hour he ejaculates and disappears in the distance. But instead of two flames in the road, there's two steamy, gooey piles of cum. (CROWD LAUGHING) Whack to the future. Cumming, eh, this summer. Masturbation doesn't turn you blind, it takes you back in time. (PEOPLE CHEERING) (ROCK MUSIC) So fucking tired. I can't do this. I want my mommy. Ahh, thanks for showing me your dick asshole. At least I don't have to piss anymore. Ladies and gentleman give it up for your winner of tonight's competition. Carlos. (CROWD APPLAUDING) Congratulations Carlos. Thank you, thank you. You just won $5,000 and you're gonna headline at our club for the next month. Give it up for our runner-ups. They're gonna be getting some comedy classes, hey, they need 'em obviously. Once again give it up for Carlos. Every one make it home safe, thanks for coming out. (FAINT ROCK MUSIC) Sand in my ass. Sand in my ass crack. Why didn't I change before jumping in the water? So many regrets. Who am I kidding, I can't do this. So fucking tired. Where the hell is everyone? I can't be the only one out here still. Hey there. Whoa, are you like a ninja? How am I supposed to finish this thing with all this shit running down my leg? Ewh. Whatever, I'm just glad I'm not the only one still here. Oh, sorry. Here. What's this? That's your medal. You actually ran out of time for the triathlon. Everyone else left. Thanks for trying and have a great day. Bye. Are you fucking serious? (LOUD ROCK MUSIC) Hey. Stop crying you girly American. Would you leave me alone? The race is over. I lost, okay? Go bother someone else. (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) I don't know what the fuck you're saying. I said, you are no longer a fat American. Maybe a chubby American, but that's okay. Stand up. Finish the pointless race. Do something for once in your insignificant life. (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (CROW CAWING) Yes. Yes. Whoo. Whoo. I finished the race. You hear that Alex? Fuck you. Fuck you. (COMEDIC MUSIC) (SIGHS) Didn't we just have sex the other night? No, we haven't. We haven't had sex in days and it feels like an eternity. Lately I feel like Action Jackson's turning into like old retired Jackson. Wait, are you saying we did not sleep with each other on the camping trip? Don't sound so excited about it. No we didn't. I tried but you just pulled it out and started touching yourself. So naturally, I did the same thing to Misses Jackson and we fell asleep. As disturbing as that sounds I'm actually relieved. Relieved? You're relieved we didn't have sex? What's going on with you? Are you cheating on me? Do you think I'm ugly? No, no, it's not any of that. Lately I've been working on fixing myself. I know it sounds dumb, but I swear it's not you it's me, okay? One of the many lessons I've learned these last few days is that you are one of the most kindest and caring women I've met in my entire life. You are so beautiful inside and out and the fact that you feel the same about me will always blow my mind. And for your information, Mr. Action Jackson is not retired. He's more like on a hiatus gaining his strength and I have a feeling he's gonna be back very soon and better than ever. I love you jelly bear. Well, it's been fun, but it's time to say goodbye. I know. I'm going to miss you too, but we'll see each other all the time. I promise, I promise we're gonna see each other again, all right? No, don't you, don't you dare. We said we weren't gonna cry. Might as well eat shitty one last time before I get my body back. Aww, that's so cute. Is my baby trying to lose some weight? I guess you can say that. I only have time for four rounds of breakfast this morning. I gotta meet up with Alex. Hey how's he doing anyway after the other night? He seemed really upset and pretty sure he's avoiding us. He's been a little weird lately. Since the whole thingy between you. What do you mean? I don't know. What'd you guys get it on or something? Don't be a silly willy. He came to the bar last night. He drank way too much, so we put him on the couch and I think about midnight he came into our room crying, asking for his mommy. It's really sad he's never had a mother figure. You know, we've really enjoyed raising him over the last few years. He's like a son to us. I'm gonna miss having you guys around all the time. Miss us? What are you talking about? You're not planning on moving? Who'm I going to cook for? No, no, no, no, no. I'm just saying that you guys are really awesome and I love you so much. Aw, babe. We love you too. We love you too. You see him? No, he's not here obviously. So I did that triathlon you were training for. Yeah? Yeah. I actually hired this crazy foreign dude off of Craigslist. He kept talking shit to me in another language and was like throwing fruits and vegetable at me when we were training. I actually lost the race. But I finished. They even gave me this cool medal. You finished the race? Like from start to finish? Yeah, but like I said I lost. Who cares man? You finished a triathlon. Like how many people can say they've done that? That's pretty fucking awesome. I'm proud of you, man. Thanks. And I know when you came by the tent the other day it looked like something went down between me and Holly, but nothing happened I swear. I mean besides me being overdosed on the weed brownies that she poisoned me with, I couldn't even get a hard on if I tried. Wait, you got high? Yeah, I don't want to talk about it man. Oh, I bet Holly gave you those weed brownies I was cooking up. They had shrooms in them. You were probably tripping balls. Yeah. So let's talk about what happened between you and your mom? You know, your mother? The woman who gave birth to you? You didn't have sex with her by any chance, did you? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Yeah, you do. You're mom told me. You did her and Shaniqua dirty. Even if there were true, which it's not, how could I even have sex with my mom? I'm not even me. I'm not even Matt. I'm not... Hey, hey, hey. Relax bro. I'm just messing with you. I wanted to see your face. See my face, whatever. Nothing happened, all right? Nothing happened? Yeah, nothing. Are you sure? Yes. (SIGHS) Thank god. You know that comedy show you were practicing for? I did that, I didn't get first place but you are now the proud owner of three free comedy workshop classes, so, you're welcome. Fucking, fuck yeah. Awesome. I'm gonna give you those for Christmas. Wow, thank you. That's amazing. Can't wait. And I'm proud of you. You must've done a lot of work because you were fucking terrible. Yeah, I worked pretty hard on it. No, I mean you were the worst. Like watching you tell a joke was like getting fisted by someone wearing Hulk hands. I get it, I was bad, all right? Yeah, fucking unbearable. I'm sorry I thought you slept with my girlfriend. Should've trusted you. Yeah, I'm sorry that... I'm sorry too. I shouldn't have said the things I said. I was just angry, being a dumb ass. We cool? Yeah, we cool. (CALM MUSIC) Oh shit, it's Magic Mike. (LOUD CRASH) What the? Crap. It said it's right here. Come on. Come on. Gotcha. Ha, yes. Holy shit. I hope your hobo legs are broken, you fucking asshole. (COUGHING) Come on, wake up. Quit fucking around. You gotta change us back, dude. Come on. Come here. Come here. You feel anything? No, do you? No. Come on. Do you feel anything now? (MYSTICAL MUSIC) Are you, you? Yeah, you? Yeah. You know what this means, right? We're gonna fucking party tonight.
