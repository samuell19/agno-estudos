Since the Japanese occupation, Koreans fought for independence at home and abroad. Starting on March 1, 1919, a national protest was held for two months. Though they were nonviolent, 7,500 were killed, and 47,000 were arrested. SEODAEMUN PRISON Get off. Take a picture of a ghost? She's ghastly. YU GWAN-SUN Prisoner 371. On March 1, she... No need. It's obvious. Illegal protesting and breach of peace? Yes, sir. Six months? One year? She received three years in the retrial. Five years in the first trial, sir. Contempt of court, too? What did this young bitch do? Defiant face unique to Koreans... You went to high school. You must know Japanese. Listen carefully! Stay quietly here. Don't do anything but breathe for three years. If not, you won't make it out alive! Understood? Nishida Jiro. Yes, sir! Why did you apply as an officer? It's because I want to be a true citizen of Japan, sir. Really? Is that all? I also needed a good job, sir. You speak Japanese well. Where did you learn it? While working at a rice dealer shop in Incheon, sir. Rice dealer? Are you strong? Yes, sir! I'll do anything, sir. FEMALE CELL EIGHT Prisoner 371. Enter. I know that bitch. She went to study in the capital and came back on her high horse. Mrs. Kim? Right. I'm Man-seok's mom. Since you stirred our town to protest, the Japanese trampled it! Your mother and father... Even my son got stabbed to death! My poor son. Independence is not worth his life. - Why did he go and protest? - Please stop, ma'am. I can't live without him. No one forced us to protest. What? I don't care about the protests. All I did was beg the Japanese cops to bring back my son! How in the world did I end up in here? I'm stuck in prison with a kisaeng like her. Why me... My poor, innocent boy... Join us. If you stand still, your legs will swell and hurt. Don't pity me. Acting high and mighty here, too? Ae-ra? Remember me from school? Are you hurt anywhere? She did a hunger strike for a while. You did? No, I just fasted as I prayed. But it just made me weaker and didn't help. So think of your future and stay healthy. Okay? Eat it.

It was perfectly pronounced. Nishida, was it? Yes, sir. This is your first task. Find the female prisoner who speaks Japanese well.

Yes, sir! Do you know why Korea perished? I learned it's due to laziness and division, sir. Right, division. Koreans are awfully selfish people who only think of their own gains. They slander and fight each other and eventually fall to pieces. But prisoners who fight over food... have banded together? It makes no sense. I agree it's wrong, sir. Is that so? Even dogs attack their masters when they are starving. So, when the time comes, beat the first to bite. Are you okay? I just pretended it hurt. Back then... Thank you, ma'am. Please. Let's be friends. How could I? I'm a commoner who serves tea. That's more absurd. We protested to erase discrimination like that. I wish for a dream world like that, but it's far from now. You're a student, all right. I know you well. My customers spoke of kisaengs a lot. To have a drink with Kim Hyang-hwa in Suwon, it'll be hard unless you're a wealthy landlord. They're all just rumors. Whether they were white or married, I poured drinks to anyone who liked me. Except one. Who? You know. Japanese. Damn girls. You think this is a playground? Go to sleep! If I were a man, I would've had a drink with you. Sounds nice. If I were a man, I'd go to Manchuria and Russia. I'll fly around the world. A woman can do it, too. Our loving God, we thank you. Even as our country has been stolen, we thank you that our family can gather and eat together. With this food, we will be strong and strive through the tough times. We know there are many who are hungry. Help us not to be arrogant but work so we can all eat well in faith and love of... Why you... You're such a coward. There's rice on your spoon. You ate during prayer. Stop acting like little children. We thank you for the food and our health. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen. You should've been switched. Let's eat. No. If he were a girl, I'd be exhausted. I'd have to punish everyone bothering... What brings you here? Well, it's for administrative control. Still, you can't barge into my house without prior notice! Even dogs aren't bothered when eating. Are you slighting us? What did he say? - Have you eaten? - Don't mind it. If not, join us. We all have to eat. Why are you doing this? You're under scrutiny. - Start searching the house! - Yes, sir! You've been here enough this month! Search every corner! How dare you! THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE It was a lovely morning. His Japanese sucks. Worse than kids. I was starving. Eat it all. You on the floor. Come out. You'll get health checks. Let's go. She said it's a health check. Does this happen often? No, it's the first time. I never heard of a doctor here. Go in first. What health check? We just got rotten apples. Prisoner 371. Come out. - What's wrong? - Come on! Gwan-sun! No! Gwan-sun! What happened out there? They asked us to tell them if we had any problems. So I said, "Give us more space to sleep and more food." That's it? What else? They asked who mentioned the frogs first. So? You're doubting me? I lived in the same town as her since she was young! You squealed on her, didn't you? I heard you threw a chair in your retrial. Will you throw that, too? Chairs are meant to sit on. Sit down. Why won't Koreans ever listen? - Nishida. - Yes, sir! What do we do to a prisoner who disobeys orders? Don't hesitate! You think you're so good? Better than you who is a dog to the Japanese. Nishida. What did she just say? She said what she did was good, sir. Then I'll let you do what you fools are good at. Bind her. That's the "hurrah" you fools love to do, right? Now, say "hurrah." You wretched thieves! You think your world will last long? Nishida. You will suffer damnation! Mark my words! What a bitch. Move! After being seen naked by strangers, I heard Korean women commit suicide. Nishida. Watch and learn. Dear God... Throw her in the wall. She'll wish she was here. Yes, sir! Hello? I'm Cho Sang-pil from Gaesung. Who are you? Hello. I'm Yu Gwan-sun from Byeongcheon. You're a woman. Byeongcheon, you say? Do you know Yu Woo-seok? You know my brother, sir? I do. We were in the same cell. He was here? I thought he was at Gongju Prison. Woo-seok cried often. He felt terrible that his younger sister got three years and he got only half that. Is my brother well? I don't know since I moved here. And you? I'm fine, sir. If you meet him, please say... that I got punished just for singing. I followed along to the women's singing. I thought there are gaps even within these dark, thick walls, and there is light... coming through the gaps. Who's drawing instead of praying at church? What about you? Why wander around instead of studying? You never lose. We can make thousands with this. Why didn't I think of this? They say if you have a bad brain, your body suffers. That means he's naked and suffering because he's dull-witted? You may have a bad brain, but he showed that you can't be bad at heart. But how can you say that Jesus is naked? You are a lady. Maybe he's cold and bare like that because it will touch people more than if he wore clothes? With such doubts, you won't go to heaven. Doubt is not the opposite of faith. And I still have more interest in people than God. It's only been two days in there. Water... Come out. Take him away. Do you think you can last? If you ask to be let out, you can be. But... you must say it in Japanese. Bitch. It's hard to last three days, but it's been a week? Your legs will start to rot. APRIL 1, 1919, AUNAE MARKET, BYEONGCHEON Hurrah! Long live Korean independence! Hurrah! Long live Korean independence! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Long live Korean independence! Long live Korean independence! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Long live Korean independence! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! It's dangerous! Run! Hurrah! No! Kill them all! Dear! No! - Father! - Dear! - Father! - Dear! Dear, wake up! Father... No! Mother! Two can come out. If you rebel, this is what happens. Poor Gwan-sun. Oh, no. You don't deserve to cry. This is all your fault! Please... It was the Japanese, not her. Gwan-sun... Please. I deserve to die. - They said I could keep my baby... - What? How can you raise a baby in here? They said babies born in here are tossed out... Her eyes are moving. Really? Gwan-sun. - Gwan-sun. - My God... He wet his diaper. Change it. It hasn't dried yet. Thank you. You inspire me to take heart. Really? I can barely take care of myself. I can't imagine doing what you're doing. I couldn't imagine it either before giving birth. How can you have such a pretty baby? You'll have one later, too. Thank you, too. You must be cold. Come here. Sweet baby. Spring is coming. You know she's the most defiant of them all. This time, she made a humble request in Japanese to the guard, sir. Really? What did she request? I feel guilty eating free food when I'm a sinner. Only model prisoners are allowed to do labor. If she works hard and becomes a model prisoner, it'll set an example. Can you be sure of that? Yes, sir. What's the hardest labor here? Get up! Get back to work! Stupid bitch! You're not well. Why work there? I just want to know what it's like outside. You're not planning something, are you? That day is coming up. But I don't know today's date... If you find out? Then what? Gwan-sun, it's too dangerous in here. The only thing we can do in here is just pray. Ae-ra. It says in the Bible, "Faith without works is dead." Gwan-sun. It's not the right time. Let's do it when we become free. But if it's an earnest wish, shouldn't we try everything we can? What would Jesus do now? ♪ Bird ♪ ♪ Bird ♪ ♪ Blue bird ♪ ♪ Don't sit ♪ ♪ On the mung bean field ♪ Excuse me. Wait! I'm looking for Yu Woo-seok from Byeongcheon. Careful. All your fingernails can fall out soon. The lye water is so damn strong! Hey! If you're done eating, stop yapping and work! And you! Number 371, how is the work? In here, the important thing is surviving. Right? Then what's important to you? Without freedom, why is it so important to live? Freedom? What's that? Tell me. Spending my one life on what I want. Then I have freedom. - I'm doing what I want. - No. You only do what the Japanese say. That's called slavery. What? Why you! Remember, you're out here thanks to me. What's the date today? Why do you want to know? I can bear anything in here except one thing. I can't pass my parents' death anniversary because only beasts would do that. So... that's the reason you wanted to work out here? When did they die? They both died on April 1. Don't worry. That's far off. Wait! So, how many days are left? Just tell me what day it is today? Please, sir. Hurry! It looks like rain! Work faster! Hurry up! Take them inside! Hurry! Hurry up! I found him. Is he well? How could he be well in here? Please wait. How are things in the male prison? About what? What do you wish to know? Last year... The anniversary is coming up. I didn't come in here for shouting "hurrah", but who'd think about that while struggling in here? It's all in the past. It's raining! Hurry! Stupid fools! Hurry up! What's wrong? Did you hear some bad news? Tell us what's wrong. If you didn't shout "hurrah" in protest, you wouldn't be here. Have you ever regretted it? Of course I have. But if I could go back, I'd still do it again. Really? After seeing my dear friend's arm get cut off by Japanese soldiers, I had to do something! No matter how hard it is here, I can't forget her arm being cut as she held on to our flag. I have to be strong. Do you regret it, Gwan-sun? Didn't we shout "hurrah" knowing this will happen? I just thought it was a duty. A duty to take back our country. To me, it's not about our country or a duty. Even when it was our country, life was still difficult for us. So even if the Japs rule... I thought things would be the same for us kisaengs. It's just going from rich men to Japanese. Still... we were at least treated as humans. But the Japanese bastards... They used us as sex toys. No, we were no different than toilets. I shouted for independence not caring if I died. Rather than live in hell, it'd be better to commit suicide. I think... I just spoke of ideals and acted high and mighty. Like Man-seok's mother said, if I didn't go back to tell my village about the protests, my parents and 15 of my village people would still be alive. If I do what is right, I thought God would help me. Compared to you, I don't deserve to shout for independence. Just like everyone in here is different, we have different reasons for protesting. Your parents had theirs, too. It was their choice. If it's not a leap month, we have three days left. 22, 23, 24, 25. MARCH 1, 1920 What's wrong? Oh, no! Are you okay? What is it? Pull her out! Take her to her cell. Weak bitch. It's not easy to become a model prisoner. What happened? Gwan-sun! - Gwan-sun. - What's wrong? What happened? She's unconscious? - Gwan-sun. - Gwan-sun! Open your eyes! I can't just do laundry on the first anniversary. So? What will you do? I don't want to regret not doing something today. I want to say that I tried. Fine. God may not erase our trials, but He'll give us strength to endure. You're all free to join me or not. We declare... Korea is an independent country and Koreans are self-governing people. We believe in the equality of humankind. This we proclaim to our descendants so that they may enjoy posterity as their inherent right. Until the last person, until the last moment, let all things be done decently and in order, so that our behavior may be honorable and upright. Anytime, anywhere... proudly shout! Long live Korean independence! Long live Korean independence! Long live Korean independence! Long live Korean independence! Long live Korean independence! Long live Korean independence! Hurrah! Long live Korean independence! Long live Korean independence! Long live Korean independence! Long live Korean independence! - Hurrah! - Long live Korean independence. - Hurrah! - Hurrah! Long live Korean independence! Long live Korean independence! Long live Korean independence! Long live Korean independence! Long live Korean independence! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurry! Let's go! Hurry! Long live Korean independence! They're protesting at the prison! They're shouting "hurrah" at the prison! They're protesting in prison! - They're protesting in prison! - Really? Stop drinking! Let's go! - Hurrah! - Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Long live Korean independence! Hurrah! Long live Korean independence! Hurrah! Hurrah! Not again! Damn it. The nearby area is sheer chaos. Streetcars are shut down. Mounted police are here. The nightmare of last year is back! It started because someone said they heard "hurrah" coming from prison! That means, it started here. Our prison is blamed for this! Fools! What were you doing! Compared to 3,000 prisoners, we're outnumbered... So, Chief Guard? You came to make excuses? Plan to stop this! Sir. It's no different from a riot. If we find and execute the leaders, it'll calm down, sir. That's easy to say. But they're all shouting! How will we find out who started this! Why not say just kill them all? Damn it. What do we do? - Sir? - What is it? I've received a report. We know where this started. Hurrah! Do you hear people shout "hurrah"? Try it. Say, "hurrah!" Make him fight for independence so he can come back here? I saw you shouting for independence, too. I did it to relieve stress. Shouting "hurrah" feels good. Hurrah! Hurrah! Long live Korean independence! Long live Korean independence! Hurrah! Hurrah! Long live Korean independence! Hurrah! Open it. You. You've been working hard to become a model prisoner? Then why are you here instead of doing laundry? Gwan-sun... No. No! How dare you measly women care about politics? Women like you raised kids into dimwits who ruined your country. You should be ashamed to shout "hurrah"! You should be ashamed, not us! That's right! Long live Korean Independence! Long live Korean Independence! Hurrah! Damn bitches have strength to shout? Cut their rations in half! Hurrah! Long live Korean Independence! Long live Korean Independence! Who did you plot it with? No one. Then who ordered you to do it? Someone did make me do it. There is someone, sir. Who is it? You Japanese fools. Japanese fools? We protest because of you. Don't you know by now? She protests because... Enough! - Bind her. - Yes, sir! I'll ask one last time. Do you regret starting the shouting protests? You're the ones who'll regret. Japan will be ruined. You won't give up? Pull it. "To commemorate the royal wedding of Prince Lee and Queen Nashimoto Masako, special pardons are given to reduce... all prison sentences in half. From Governor General Saito Makoto." Congratulations, sir. That solves overpopulation here, sir. I think... it can solve another headache for us, sir. What do you mean? Tell them about the special pardons, but add a condition, sir. For national unity, the governor general will give special pardons of reducing all sentences in half. What are they saying? Our sentences will be cut in half. What? I already did the time. Does that mean I can leave? Wait. However, protestors for independence will be excluded! What now? Anyone who shouts for independence will not get the special pardon. They're trying to stop us from protesting. Then I won't protest. What about Gwan-sun? She got three years. She can't leave with us. Even if it's reduced, she has six months left. Six more months? - They're conniving. - But we can get out! I want to leave! Mr. Cho! I was released thanks to your protests. Are you all right? Yes. But I heard about your sister on the way here. My sister Gwan-sun? What is it? She was taken to underground solitary. ONE MONTH LATER Prisoner 367. That's you. Sign here. HURRAH Released! Go one by one! Released. Line up! Go one by one! I've never seen you smile before. A senior told me earlier there is a provisional government in Shanghai. Really? What's that? It's where our own government is being prepared. He survived in here, so he'll live well. Have a long life with your mama. He's the dad? Yes. Go on. - Have a good life. - I will. Excuse me. Do you know Gwan-sun? You're just as she described you. I see. How is my sister? I'll tell you outside. Get in line! I have good news for you. Thanks to the mercy of the Emperor, sentences have been reduced. Your sentence will be reduced in half. Do you understand? I said I'm not a prisoner since I came here. So your talk of mercy and reducing sentences... It has nothing to do with me. She said she isn't a prisoner, so she doesn't care, sir. I hate that you people had your sentences reduced, too. Especially defiant fools like you. I can't sleep thinking you'll go out and protest again! And bitches like you must not have children! You'll give birth to more rebellious fools like you! Clean up. Didn't you hear me? Jeong Chun-young! Clean up the floor! Yes, sir. Damn Korean. Stupid bitch. You want to die that badly? Couldn't you stay low for a second? Hey. You! Wash the floor now! For three months, she had 12 requests for visits. However, 371 refuses to be called a prisoner, sir. In that case, her visits should not be allowed, sir. On what grounds? She doesn't accept her sentencing. She shouldn't be given rights, sir. WARDEN, KAKIHARA TAKURO What you say is contrary to our policy to develop into the same civilization as the West. You don't want the protests to start again, do you? No, sir. Gwan-sun. Do you recognize us? You've become more handsome. And you're even prettier, Hyang-hwa. The dress suits you. You'll be out soon, right? It must be pretty outside in the fall. I have so much to do when I go out. I want to greet our parents at their graves. And I want to cook a meal for you, Woo-seok. I want to have a drink with you, Hyang-hwa. Of course. Do everything you want. What's with your leg? My pelvis hurts from sitting too long. It's true. I'm not well. Damn bastards. Gwan-sun? Can you please come out alive? I want to protest with you one more time. It's a pity that I can't... I'm so sorry. For what? For everything. Woo-seok. I'm not scared at all. So please don't be scared. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cry. It's okay. I planned many things, but there's nothing I can do. May I ask what you plan to do now? I'm going to Manchuria. I'm not going to lose either. Who are you? Wait! Stop! Don't kill me. I'm Korean. My name is Jeong Chun-young. Don't kill me. A Korean? Then you tortured your own people? No! I just translated for them. I have to provide for my parents and sister. Please! Please don't kill me! Why must you do this? Then who will? Yu Gwan-sun died on September 28, 1920, two days before her release. Her body was taken to be secretly cremated but was stopped upon request by Ewha School. Her body was buried in Itaewon Cemetery but later lost in 1939 when the cemetery was made into an airfield by the Japanese. Jeong Chun-young was arrested in 1949 by the Investigative Committee of Antinational Activities. However, he was released without penalty when the committee was dispersed under Rhee Syng-man's administration.
