What're you gonna do with your cut? I think I'll take a trip, post-army, you know. Post-army? now? You're almost 100. No, a long trip, with a backpack.

And what? To see how you're doing these days. What? These are ten important days, the High Holy Days, between Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur. Man's relations with his fellow man... Are you preaching to me? Why are you so mad, Shaul? I came to cheer you up as soon as you got out, after all that time in jail... God knows what they did to you. did what? You don't have to tell me. It's your business." I'm not judging.a man's gotta do what a man gotta do Red alert, red alert... Where's the bomb shelter? Inside. -Let's go! I wouldn't go in there if a missile fell on me. But it's dangerous. C'mon! May our Rabbi the Messiah King live forever. So now you're Tevye the Dairyman? I've seen some hard times. seriously? you've seen hard times? How's Orna?

I know, but he'll be here when I get back, won't he? You could be late for once. Aren't you going to pick him up I haven't had time, what with all the shopping. Mom, you haven't filled it out. That's right. I don't... -Okay, I'll tell Marina it's not happening. -Why? She has to send an answer. -No, you have two more weeks. What difference will it make? I don't know, but I... I'm looking into it. Mom, you already looked into it. -No... I hear you, I understand. It's okay. Really. I'm not sure I really want it anyway. Sorry I didn't pick you up. I didn't have time. Don't worry about it. I bought you a little something, Earrings. Like 'em? They're nice. Thanks. When'd you get so tall? Wow. Look at this ballerina. Gimme a hug. I missed you. Orna, wake up. Noam. Hurry. -It keeps happening. Same thing every night. Let's go, Tikva! I'm coming, I'm coming. Damn them. We should go in with bulldozers and tanks and raze Gaza to the ground. Good morning. Morning. -I made you breakfast. Sit down, before it gets cold. Orna, join us. What did you fry up? My special omelet. I thought we'd have breakfast together. I have to go, Mom. Yeah, me too. Oh... I'll put it in a sandwich for you. Here, see A little tahini... You like omelets, don't you? She doesn't eat eggs, Shaul. Oh, I didn't know. what...? vegetarian? Vegan. Hurry, you don't want to be late. Have a great day. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. I'll eat it. I missed you. When did you move into Noam's bed? She got used to sleeping with me. All the missiles at night and... running down to the bomb shelter. We got used to it. Hasn't her fear gone yet? How could it be over, Shaul? It comes and goes. We had so many nights like those when you were gone. What corner? The road is straight. I can't see you. Oh, now I see you. Thank you. God bless. Are you crazy, coming here now? People are leaving the south and you're coming here? need to talk to him. Then phone him. Haven't you folks heard of phones? I don't understand what he says. I want to look him in the eye. Okay, c'mon. why is it so heavy? You brought "kosher" food again? Shut up. I'm late for work. -Never mind. Shaul, I have to go. What? What's the Royal Academy? The Royal Academy, Shaul. I got that, but what is it? -It's... Noam got the highest score in Israel and they're offering her a place there. Our Noam? The highest score in Israel? -Yeah. Wow, amazing. Where is it? London. Oh. How does it work? Do they pay? They give a partial scholarship, but it's still expensive. Oh. That's why you were so busy. I've been slaving away for months, taking double shifts, and they're pressuring me, they have a waiting list as long as your arm, and we have two weeks to decide if we're going for it. What's to decide? It's her dream, her big chance. How'll we do it, Shaul? I'll deal with it. Not that again. Do me a favor, don't deal with anything, okay? I gotta go. What do you mean, "not that again?" I don't want to go into it. Let's discuss it later. Don't go now, we're talking. I'm late, I gotta work. Are you blaming me for something? Are you seriously asking me? -Yes. Don't you know why I did it? Think I did it for a Volvo? I did it for a crappy apartment with a safe room so Noam would stop crying! Did you forget we signed a contract? Is it my fault the fucking appraiser assessed our apartment at 300,000 less? What was I supposed to do, give in? Ya think I wanted to go to jail? Maybe if you'd told me we'd have been spared the trouble. Shaul. What do you want now, a retrial? Didn't I pay enough? -What? You paid? And we didn't? Did it ever occur to you that I could've done something more interesting than Bethe "outstanding employee" at Tsippi's Nail Salon? You ruined us, Shaul. Move. "This is in your place, this is in your stead". "This is your atonement, this money will go to charity" "and you'll go to a good life and peace". "This is in your place, this is in your stead". "This is your atonement, this money will go to charity" "and you'll go to a good life and peace". "This is in your place, this is in your stead". Orna. How are you? Nissan? Guilty as charged. -Wow, what happened? With God's help I found my way. It's weird. I'll have to get used to it. Yeah.rt -Where've you been? f Long story. -What's up, Orna? Just a sec. Need something? Yeah, I heard Shaul was released. How are you two doing? Alright? Excuse me? Got a few minutes for me? -Now? I need you, it's urgent. -Sorry. Not now, Nissan, I have a customer. Have a seat. I have a family occasion... -OK...SO do I. I was before you, ma'am. I'm also a customer Nissan. It's 100 shekels. I'll pay. What do you want, pedicure or gel nail polish? Sure. Let's do it. Busy, huh? Holiday season. The High Holidays. Special. Important times. You know why they're called the Days of Awe? It's when God judges us, either for a year of life, or, God forbid, punishment for our sins. Especially between man and his fellow man, between man and wife. Nissan, did Shaul send you? Of course not. This is between you and me. Call me an emissary. -Emissary? Yes, emissary. -From who? You know what the true Temple is? A Jewish home. Such a powerful thing. Imagine how hard it was to build the Temple. King Solomon R.I.P spent his whole fortune on it, all in cash, no loans, and it was destroyed just like that. Just like that, twice. Y'know what I'm saying? Don't let the temple you took years to build be destroyed just like that. Nissan, I don't understand... What don't you understand? He's talking about divorce. Divorce.That was obvious. what? Who asked for your opinion? Did I say anything about divorce? Why, is it a dirty word? Listen, Orna, me and Molly have discussed this several times. Several times we've discussed this. Since rabbi "tevia" here brought it up, ~ you should know, sometimes it's the best thing you can do, |and if you use my lawyer, Elshurov, I'll make sure he gives you a discount. I dunno... -Don't be scared. .It's much easier than being alone for three years. I also agree. Molly, I... -What are you saying? Molly, are you crazy? What's with you all? that was'nt what I was aiming for... I'm done. Other hand? Nissan. Ready to go? You wanted the money, didn't you? What's on your hand? It's... it's jelly, it doesn't come off. Were you at the salon? Did you talk to Orna? What did you tell her? I just told her about the Days of Awe. You stay away from her. I've had enough of your help, Nissan. I understand. Now where's the money? Sixty, huh? Ezra. Get up. Get up. Get up. Fuck! Shut up. Be quiet, I have to take this call. What? -Here. Grocery shopping? Again? There's a yogurt for him. It's in with the puddings. So what if it has bananas? Bananas go good with vanilla Ettie, I'm not going shopping for a plain yogurt, for God's sake, I'm working. So he doesn't have to eat it! She's driving me nuts with her fuckin' hormones! Why did I shoot him? We're short again. I counted 57 chunks of hash. Arthur, I swear on the Bible. Don't kill me. Say "ah." You're lucky it's almost Yom Kippur. I'd rather not kill around now. It's a sin. Fucking Nabil. You suspect him too? -For sure. Then why'd you shoot Shimmy? -Because he represents me, and he's an idiot. He's not such an idiot. -He's a barrel of idiocy. Look at his truck. "Shimmy is Organic Fertilizer". Shouldnt it say "Shimmy's?" What about the safecracker? He's out of jail. What about him? -Bring him to me. What is this dump? You live here? Temporarily. I asked Avraham to help me out. It's good for him too, he doesn't need a night watchman. What's that? Oh, Avraham put that up. To scare off thieves or little thugs like we used to be. Wonderful. Where's the money? Not here. So why'd you bring me here? To wait together until nightfall, what happens at nightfall? We can go get the money. Nissan, are you bullshitting me? Bullshitting you, Shaul? God forbid. We can't get it in the daytime, I buried the money in a strategic location just after you went in, before I took off. You think I'd take the money to Nigeria? They'd kill you for toothpaste there. Have a seat, Shaul. How about some coffee? My treat. I had to choose you for a partner... Are you and Orna share the same bed? Enough of this. I'll be back at nightfall. Wait, Shaul, I didn't mean to pry. I just want... you and Orna... I need you to forgive me. Know what I mean? Gladly. Want my eyeballs, too? God forbid. -How do you expect me to forgive you? I need you to say "forgiven, forgiven, forgiven". Not "how," how? You're right. It's not enough to say it, you have to mean it. That's why i think that money isn't the answer. Say what? What're you doing.? Shaul, Shaul. You wanna drive me crazy? -Stop it, Shaul. -Where's the money? What's with you? -Where's the money?! -Wait... Shaul, I'm talking to you. -Gimme the money! Where are you taking me? To the border? What's with the fancy maneuvers? See what a brilliant idea? -No. Don't you get it? I thought, where will people be afraid to look? Here, since it's the Gaza border, people are afraid to come here. Nothing but army patrols. Brilliant... You're running around like a weasel, if the army sees you they'll shoot you in the back. No way, look at me, I'm obviously a Jew. You look like Hamas's top agent. Shh. Let's go. How do you remember the spot after three years? I thought of everything. I wrapped the bag in shrink wrap, came to these army barriers, like the one they put outside your house? I counted ten steps and buried it in the sand. How do you know which barrier? I marked it. I wrote "P.H." ("Here"). You did what? -I wrote "P.H,". in spray paint. "P.H." ("Here"). They'll think some bored soldier wrote his initials, you know, Pinny Halevi, Pinny Hacohen, Pinny... Herman. Plenty of possibilities. Shit. Probably just some army truck. They'll be gone in a minute. It's the guy who puts down the barricades, he was outside your house. Dammit, it isn't here. There was a barrier right here so there's a good chance it's here. There were lots of barriers here, moron. Why couldn't you have just stowed the bag in a closet? Closet? I told you, I went away. Besides, how was I supposed to know they'd move the barriers? I found something. Whoa. Look, it's a missile that didn't explode. Don't touch that, get rid of it. Stupid moron... You ruined my life. You wanted forgiveness? There is no money, is there? What'd you do with it? It's there. How could you do it? Everything was perfect. I knew that safe better than the guy who made it. I had it open in ten minutes. All you had to do, Nissan, was take the bag, put it in the car, wait with the motor running and watch my back. Damn you Shaul... Shaul... Help me, Father. Need some help, Rabbi? Arthur lives here, right? Who? Arthur? Oh. You're the Rebbe who makes 'Kapparot' (atonements) this year? Gladly. Sit down. Hold on. Where is the chicken? Aren't you supposed to bring it? What? Oh, you do it with money. It's an option. You'll be called in a minute. Hi, Ettie. What's up? Why are you so interested in this guy, Shaul? Nabil's son is getting married. He has to pay for the hash he stole, the bastard. Mom, Dad said bastard. -No he didn't, he said "bustard". It's a Biblical bird, darling. Damn it with you, Arthur. He has his mother's hearing. What was that? -Huh? What? -What? Want some? Oh no... Sean! Get out of the water, honey! Get out of the water, stupid! Help him, Arthur! Get out of the water! What are you thinking!? Can't you swim? Swim! Get over here. -Take him out. It's a red alert, stupid! What's up? What are all those people doing in your room? I told you, my room is the safe room , all concrete, no windows everyone comes here when there's a siren. What's that, a horse? He always does that. What's with the noise, Rhea? -What? Turn it off. -Alright. Now. -Okay... Look, Mom, Romeo's balls are as big as my head. Why is the horse here again? I told you a thousand times to leave it in the stable, didn't I? Now the kid look his balls. Disgusting. Yes, but it's not... fuck the english... It's not safe, Ettie. Romeo is family. Shit, Arthur, I think Romeo is... Look, Mom, it's green. Wow, it's huge! Yuck, this is my room. That's the last time the horse comes inside, y'hear me? Fine. For heaven's sake... Mom, who's he? -Arthur, who's he? Ezra, who's he? The rabbi who does 'Kapparot.1 That Alfasi's got quite a racket going, he sends his apprentices to slaughter the chickens. No chicken, He uses money. -But Dad, you promised you'd behead it! I promised Sean a chicken. Phone Elfasi. No, I'm not with Elf asi. What? -Not with Elfasi? I asked you if you're the Kapparot rabbi. It was a misunderstanding. -Then what are you doing here? I wanted to speak to you in private. Speak up. I need a loan. What? Just a few hundred thousand. -Don't mention money here! Mom, that's loads of money. Who is he, Ezra? -I don't know. Get dressed, Rabbi. He's clean, Arthur. What's on your hand? Jelly. It doesn't come off. Gross. What are you, a flower child? You wear nail polish? No, it's from... I was babysitting my niece and she... I told you, I'm not a cop. You came to my house to ask for money? Do I look like a crook to you? Of course not. God forbid. Arthur, you're known throughout the community as a philanthropist, a charitable man. Doing deeds without anyone knowing... Okay, okay. How much? 300 grand. Forget it. I can't help you. How would you pay it back? I have the money, I just need a loan. Where? In the bank? Whaddya got, a short-term deposit you can withdraw? A grandma who's about to die? -God forbid. She's already dead. Then what? Speak up. Remember the post office robbery three years ago? Yeah, it was a big score. That guy who just got out of jail... Shh... Go on. I was with him, I spent 6 months gathering information, I was his right-hand man. You? -Yeah. That was before... You know. Past life. You were with Shaul when he got caught robbing the post office? How do you know him? Small world. And God is great. Praise the Lord. May our Rabbi the Messiah King live forever. I won't loan you the money. Why not? -I have something better in mind. It's the same safe as at the post office, the same model. It's loaded with cash and we get half for the job. So you're in? How did he put us together? Did you tell him about the post office? What could I do? I went to him for a loan. To pay you back. Arthur doesn't give money to just anyone, so I... I had to prove I'm trustworthy, that I'm a thief, too. So he wants to screw his Bedouin dealer and you, with your born-again outfit, want to work with him? Nabil is a drug dealer. He's destroying our children. Besides, Arthur's screwing him because he stole from him. And the Talmud says: "One may steal from a thief." You want to break into a Bedouin crook's house? They'll roast you alive. -No, it's a no-brainer. This Nabil guy is marrying off his son, okay? We'll pretend we're guests. No-brainer, huh? You want to put me back in jail. God forbid. Forget it. -I just want to atone, Shaul. -Fine. I understand. Just help me out, Shaul. Is this diamond? Nissan? Rivki, what are you doing here? I see you're glad to see me. Very glad, I just... So you came here? All this way to get away from me? God forbid. Of course not. I just... C'mere... Want something to drink? “ C'mere. What can I get you? Have a seat. Want some water? No. -Tuna in water? You like that. Save it for later. I brought you your favorite meatballs. Really? Bless you, Rivki. Bless You, 0 Lord, creator of all foods. -Amen. Punctured with the spicy sauce. What's going on, Nissan? Are you okay? What can't you tell me? Why'd you come here now? Don't you watch the news? The whole south is in flames. Yeah, but you didn't say how long you'd be gone. What am I meant to think? You talk to me about the future, next thing you're in this dump. If you've changed your mind, just say so. Of course not. I made my decision. Wipe your mouth. Am I all red? -A little. What's on your hand? Oh. Jelly. -Jelly? Gel polish. -Why do you have gel polish? It's nothing, nothing at all. Okay.. -What... Rivki, calm down. How'm I supposed to calm down? You don't tell me anything. I want to know what you're hiding. do anything, cleaning, construction, hauling, whatever. I'll work Fridays, Saturdays, mornings, nights; double shifts, triple shifts. I'm a workhorse. Just one thing... I need, if it's possible, some money up front to show the bank so they'll give me a loan. I got nothing for you. Whoa, too much hot sauce. Oshik, you've known me since grade school. Yeah, I remember. You called me Gargamel, didn't you? We were just kids. Oshik... please. You know I have a wife and a daughter. Who, Orna? She did pretty well without you around. What's going on? A fight! Leave him alone! What are you doing?... Shaul! What's going on? I'm calling the police. Go back where you came from. -Oshik, what happened? Please don't get us in trouble. -Listen to me, Orna, you deserve much better than him. Everyone thinks so. Trash. Filthy thug. Show's over, folks. Saw a little blood? Buzz off. Get back to work. C'mon, Shoshi. Trash. I didn't mean to, Orna, was looking for work. That's how you look for work? That was the last thing we needed. What do you want from me? What do I want from you? I don't know. I don't know who you are anymore. I don't know what happened to the man I married, who promised me... I can't take care of you, too, Shaul. You understand. Things are hard enough as it is, will this ever end? 've had enough. Orna, what are you saying? Wait. -Shaul, I can't take it anymore. Nissan.. Nissan... Nissan.. Nissan.. Nissan.. Nissan! Nissan! For God's sake! What're you doing!? Get down from there! Get down! I won't allow it! Get down! What're you doing Nissan! -Get down, I said! What're you doing!? -Get down! No! -Down, down, down! Are you alive? Shaul. I'm in where? ah.. Listen, Nissan, when you see someone in that situation, don't hang onto him, just cut the rope. Hm.. How're things at home? How's Orna? Want to share? You remember a few words in Arabic from school, right? Sure. Simple stuff, nothing fancy. Via\a^ Halik. Halik, halik. What's "halik?" It's a word. "Halik" means "release me". I asked "how are you" and you answered "release me, release me, release me"?. Know any more Arabic? You know what you just said? "The goat is not mine. "Ruth ate a kilo of olives". Is that your small talk? -That's what they taught in school. Don't talk, don't breathe. You're mute. If anyone asks, say "ah." Ah. Like that? Nice of you to bring a present even though we aren't really guests. What is it? These are the tools. Let's go. Oh. Wait a sec, Shaul. Well? What's that? You know, it's a Bedouin wedding, know how they dress i saw photos. Are you wearing that? Actually, I didn't bring you... That's okay, too. Mute. Remember. Mute. Are you sure this is the house? I don't hear gunshots. Why would you hear gunshots? They always shoot at weddings. You know, happy gunshots. What's up, bro? What's up boss? Now you show up? -Chill, we're here to party. Why are you shooting Nabil will come. -Stop it. Go guard the front gate. What are you doing? Ah. what "ah"? What are you doing? Ah. Don't "ah" me. Who are you? The goat is yours? no... The goat is not mine... Ruth ate a kilo of olives. What's his problem? Were you invited? Maamoul (Cookie)? Were you invited? somebody invite you? Yalla... Hummus, yalla. Did someone here invite you? Yalla, halik. Halik, yalla. Bandore (tomato). Halik. What's with this guy? Party, party, tomato, yalla. Party! Party! What are you doing, you nutcase? Get him! Greetings. Let me give you a hand with that. smoke smoke. Smoke smoke my friend, smoke the best Hashish Ruth ate a kilo of olives. What's with the outfit? what is wrong with you. I grabbed it off the clothesline. I think it's the groom's mother's. Eat shit and die (arabic). Thank you. Fuck. The tools are inside. Great idea. The tray. Follow me. There's the present. Let's open it. Hey, what are you doing? She's my wife... I sure gave it to him, huh? Nice going, Nissan. Are you okay, Shaul? -Why? Your eyes are red. Their hash is strong. - what hash? I need something sweet. Hold on... Shaul. Hurry. Let's go downstairs. Arthur said the safe is in the basement. Take it slow, the hash eats up your blood sugar. Here's the door. Open it. Locked, huh? Makes sense. Hold this. Got something? -Yeah. Hurry, Shaul. -Here. Same safe, huh? Whoa. What a record collection. Classics. Umm Kulthoum, Farid al-Atrash, Abdel Halim Hafez, Gypsies. No shit? No shit! For real? What a blast from the past. Remember my first car, "Toaster"? -Sure. I had that on tape. We'd put it on full volume, drive to the beach, run through the dunes... Drink Eagle beer, I had long curls... everyone knew me. Those were the days. Shaul... Shaul. -Huh? why don't we talk while you work? Oh. Whoa, I'm so fuckin' wasted. Hamid? Shit, Hamid! Hamid! Hamid, wake up! What happened? -Where are they? Who? -The thieves! Call Atef! Atef! Shaul, Shaul, Shaul! Are you sure? Hurry! Move it! Yes! -Don't speak too soon, you'll jinx us. Are you kidding? Yes! Until I put the cash on his desk and pay for Noam's tuition, no celebrating. It's all over we did it, Shaul. Where's the water? I need a drink. Don't drink that. What is this? Turpentine. Why do you have turpentine in a juice bottle? I used it to take off the jelly. Whoa! Shit, they're shooting at us! They're following us! Move it! Hit the gas! -I am. We're done for. They're closing in. Go! May our Rabbi the Messiah King live forever. See that right turn? -Yeah? When I say so, make a hard right. What're you doing, Shaul? -Shut up! Got a lighter? -In the glove compartment. Ready? -Yeah. Turn right! Yes! Stop jinxing us! You really think I'm a jinx? You wanna argue with the facts? What an incredible hit, like Wiiliam Tell. Bless your hands. Shaul, see if there's an old cigarette in the glove compartment. I thought you quit. You're still smoking? Only after getting shot at. Shit. -What's that? It's a siren. What do we do? Just keep driving. Whoa, that was close. Okay, it's over. Keep going. No, there are always more. I'm stopping. Nissan! Nissan, Nissan! Ow! Dammit, my leg fell asleep. What are you doing? Hit the ground. -I'll kill you. Gimme the keys, you can lie here forever. Get down, Shaul, it's dangerous. -What's so dangerous? You think it'll hit here, of all places? Jesus. Yes! It didn't blow up. Orna: Where are you? We need to talk. Master of forgiveness Prober of hearts Revealer of depths Speaker of truths... What? I've come to explain. Trying to make a fool of me? You know I stopped seeing other men. And so you should. -Then why are you wasting my time? You forget... -God forbid. I know you're a widow. I meant I'm getting older and I still haven't had kids. I want to know what you're hiding from me. Alright. My dream is to raise a family with you. I'm here for us. How can I believe you when you suddenly disappear? Just say you don't want me. But I do. You know I do, with all my heart. But just when everything seemed right... I started to feel uneasy, I didn't know why, and... And what? If I tell you, maybe... Nissan, you came here to talk. Because I felt uneasy I wrote a missive and I placed it in the book of Holy Missives and when I opened the book... I realized what the Rabbi was trying tell me. I have to get Orna and Shaul back together. Orna? Who's Orna? Shaul? I don't get it. Orna... the gel polish. I have to fix the home I tore apart before I build my own. Okay... Can I ask you something? Sure. -God willing you'll do it, but what if you don't? I can't wait for you. Nissan: Arthur's looking for us. Where are you? Looks like rain. Noam! What are you doing here? Who's he? I'm her dad. -Oh. Can I have a word with you? Go ahead, I'll catch up. Let's go. You dance so beautifully I couldn't take my eyes off you. did you see me? I watched through the door. Mom told me about the academy in London. Wow... You're amazing. I thought I'd ask your teacher to ask the people in London for another month or two, I'll get the money together... I need time... I just got out of jail. where have you been all night? I slept on the living room because I saw you sleeping with mom had something to do Sweetheart, I know you're mad at me. -No I'm not. You are, but I'll get the money, I promise. I don't believe you. I don't understand why Mom believes you. They're waiting for me. Noam.. Are you okay? And the missile hit the van with all Nabil's money inside? Nahum, take Romeo outside and feed him. What about my half? What half? We're all screwed. I need that money for my daughter's tuition. Besides, it was an act of God. Oh, right. You're right. My bad. I didn't read the fine print. What clause was it? 6-Z? I don't find that funny. You don't find that funny? You don't find that funny? You don't find that funny, huh? Is it funnier now? -He didn't mean it, Arthur. -Shut up! Is it funnier now? Maybe you'll find this funny. No, no, please don't do that. It's almost Yom Kippur. I don't like killing around now. -And rightly so. You have until Yom Kippur to get me the money. If I don't have the money by Yom Kippur you won't have to worry about your daughter's tuition, you'll have to worry about her being able to walk. Son of a bitch! You want to put frozen beans on your head? Let's think what we learned from the Bedouin job. That you're a jinx. OK...and also we learned something else, Shau that it's convenient to rip off a crook. Think about it. So I was thinking, which crook do we have around? Arthur. -You're a genius. What a brain... Took me five hours to figure that out, and you came right up with it. Is that your great idea? Steal from Arthur and give him his own money? That's right. And here's more important information, Arthur won't hide the money in his house. What did he say when he wanted to hit Nabil? That only an idiot hides dirty money at home. It's in the stable. -What? The money's in the stable. Didn't you see the camera? Didn't you see the bill stuck to the horse's hoof? I thought it was an amulet. See? It's perfect. Perfect? If you take 300,000 shekels from the stable and give him 300,000 shekels cash, won't he put two and two together? You think everyone's as moron as you? Then what do you want to do? Where do you keep your gun? -What? I'm taking this all the way. No gun, just a smoke grenade. Where do you keep your gun? You're the guard, aren't you? Even if I had one I wouldn't tell you. What's this? The dud. -What dud? When we were looking for the money... I brought it here. You brought a bomb home? Never mind that, you put me in a bed with a bomb under it? It's a memento. -Memento? Of what? What experience does it remind you of? Shaul, what's the big deal? Those things explode. It didn't explode when they fired it a mile away, why would it explode under a bed? Even if God wanted it to explode just as I put you in bed, nobody would accuse me of negligence. They'd think it was a direct hit, like my poor van. An act of God. What? Brilliant. Red alert! Let's go, let's go! -Hurry! Orna, look at the water. What about it? -It's moving. I tell you, they're digging here. I hear them in the kitchen, they're terrorists digging tunnels. Tikva... -When I mention it to Eyal he says it's my calcium pills. Noam, what's the matter? 's my fault. What's your fault? That Dad didn't come back. That's silly. Why? He... tried to talk to me, and... he's trying to raise my tuition. When was that? He came to my ballet lesson and I told him I don't expect anything from him, I don't want to be disappointed. It's not your fault. Okay? It's not your fault. He came to talk to me, too. Really? When? What did you say? He isn't coming back? Easy, easy, easy, easy... Easy, easy, easy, easy... "Messiah, Messiah, Messiah"... -Uh-oh. -No. I'll hold it with one hand. -No. Who's calling, God? What if it's my sick Uncle Yaakov and he fell down and can't reach his pills? I don't care. There, he reached his pills. Or he died. C'mon. Did you put the seat in back? -Of course. What's that? What you asked for. I said a baby seat. And? -That's a booster What's the difference? -You can belt in a baby seat from both sides and tilt back so the baby doesn't choke. Shaul, it's a bomb, it can't choke. Don't you have a baby seat? Listen, about Romeo.. Who's that? -The horse. What about him? -If he's an intelligent horse when the bomb goes off he might panic and get stuck in the stable. That's intelligence? Emotional intelligence. Everyone knows that horses... Anyway, I thought of a solution. brought a lure. Good idea. What is it? What horses hke. Pepperoni? Horses don't like pepperoni, they're family. Good thing you didn't bring a shot of ouzu and some olives. Not good? It's a horse, not a fox. Horses like hay, apples... Where will I get hay? Let's stop at a 7-11 and I'll get some apples. And a picnic basket while you're at it. Do me a favor, shut up until we get there, okay? Where'd you get the smoke grenade? I stole it from the army. I wanted it for the soccer championship... but we lost. Jinxed that too, huh? See the camera? Don't throw it at the camera. Throw it a few feet ahead and the smoke will cover it. God willing. We're good to go. Nothing's happening, damn it. We'll be stuck here all night. Don't worry, Shaul, it's a battle zone. It's a red alert! To the shelter! what's shelter!? Throw the grenade! That's no smoke grenade. -Yes it is. It's a fragmentation grenade. -No, it's a smoke grenade. I was gonna throw it at the goalie at the soccer game. I'm not an idiot. Well? No smoke. Must be too old. Whoa, that was close, Dad. -God help us. You would've killed the fullback, too. But it is making smoke. This isn't gonna work, Shaul. Shut up. -The siren's gonna stop soon. Shit. -I told you so. -So what do you want to do? I'm telling you, the warhead has to touch... Yes! The striker. -Then do it. You aren't letting me. -Just do it. Now you're a demolitions expert. You nearly blew up a stadium! Moron. -Watch what I'm doing. -Yeah? The whole idea is for the warhead... Get ready. Lie down. Hit the dirt! Move. I'm gonna blow him to kingdom come. The striker didn't reach. -No, no. I'll show you. -Yeah, what? Shaul... You're too close... Shaul! Shaul. Why? Explode, motherfucker! Explode! Damn them. Arthur, the whole house is shaking. Ettie, it's falling here, I'm telling you. Jesus will save us. What here? Here-here? You sure? Here-here I'm fucking sure it's Here, motherfuckers! Dad, you said motherfuckers. He's good at English. The lessons are worth it. Romeo. Pepperoni, Romeo. Romeo. Good horse, Romeo. Romeo. Nissan! Dinnertime, Romeo. -Nissan, don't go behind him. Why not? Romeo, you bastard. Let's go, pepperoni-head. What a rotten horse. Motherfucker. Rotten horse. I give him pepperoni and he breaks three ribs. See anything? Nothing. Keep looking. Shit. What? -Let's get outta here. No, keep looking. Let's go, the red alert is over, they'll come out and catch us red-handed. Let's get outta here! One more minute. Keep looking! Shaul! Ettie, take him. -Sean, c'mere. No, I want to see. -Go with Mom, it's dangerous. I don't wanna. -Sean! -Sean. You'll get hit by a bomb! I'm lighting it, Shaul. -No! Fuck. Let's go. -Give me one more minute! Let's go. -Fuck. Don't light it, just wait a second... I said don't light it, dammit! Let's go. Holy shit. I don't think anyone's coming. Flow'd you get it? We found the bag. It's from our first job. I screwed up, I hid it too well. He's a perfectionist. I need money. -You have some. No, I'm going to the hairdresser's. -Now? Yes, now. For synagogue. Today is "Kippur" remember? You want me to go looking like a mess? How much is it? Plus 100 for a shampoo. Give her 1,500. -730... I'm in the middle of counting. Where was I? 1,500. -1,500 what? -For her. Dammit, I lost count. Yuck. What's the matter? -Your money always stinks like horses/’ No honey., you're sensitive to smells these days it's new money Yah? sensitive to smells? Here, smell it. Whose ass did this come from, the Minister of the Treasury? I'm pretty sure she's afraid to walk out. What's she afraid of? Does she think he'll suddenly wise up? Look at Orna, her anger with Shaul is destroying her. Isn't that right, Molly? -Absolutely. Anger destroying you, Orna. Molly, that's enough. I disagree. Sorry, I didn't mean to butt in. That's okay, go ahead. -No, I'm not from here. It's not my place. Speak up. -Go ahead. -I just think... It's Orna, right? -Yeah. I think, if you're really angry at your husband, it means you still care about him. If you didn't love him your anger would pass. only realized that after my husband died. I'm so sorry. I didn't know. -Neither did I. Accept my condolences. That was eight years ago. And you didn't remarry? -I have someone. Maybe soon, God willing. It isn't up to me. -Who is it up to? do what I can. You should think it over. I don't know what he did or why you're angry, but at times like these forgiving is like saving a life. Sometimes, after you lose someone, you realize what he meant to you. How did you find me? saw your work. I don't mind fasting but not smoking is hard. Stop smoking, it'll kill you. You quit first. -Me? I could quit tomorrow. I don't miss it when I fast. I miss my morning coffee. My espresso. Give me my morning espresso and I can fast for five days. Strange. I'm having daejaa vu. There's a reason he chose this place. The army patrol doesn't come by here. How do you know? That's why I chose this place... -Quiet! Hurry up. I want this finished before they blow the Shofar. Shaul... Look. Is that the...? -Yeah. See? I wasn't lying. Wright. Arthur. -Shut up. Arthur, look. Shut up. Look, Arthur, it's the money. It's the money I buried. Check it out, God brought us to this very spot so we could resolve everything before the holiday. Here. Take the money and let us go. I'm taking the money anyway. That's deep enough. They'll only be half-buried. So what? Are you burying them standing up? On your knees. "This is in your stead, this is your atonement", "one will go to death, and one, to a good, long life". "This is in your stead, this is your atonement", "one will go to death, and one, to a good, long life". This is exactly the spot where their patrol doesn't go. Listen, we're just a few kilometers from town, their holiday starts in about an hour, we'll go to their synagogue and give them Yom Kippur War II. "Hear, 0 Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one". Allahu Akbar! Shaul. Nissan, are you okay? The ring. We should've eaten at home. We'll never get there before the fast. Are those new? These? Yeah, Dad gave them to me. Dad? Daddy! Noam! Sorry, you can't go in. -Noam! Daddy! -She's my daughter, let her go. -Okay. What happened? -It's nothing... -Shaul, what happened? I'm fine, everything's fine. Is this your family? -Yeah. Hi. -Hello. -Hello. This is my wife. -Hi. -And my daughter Noam. You know your dad's a hero? It could've been disastrous. Take him home and treat him good, he deserves it. I made so many mistakes I don't know where to begin. -Shaul. No, I have to say it. I'm sorry. Everything I do comes out wrong. Those are my earrings. Dad, what's in the bag? What I promised you, London. What? Rabbi, are you crazy? You're still being treated. It's almost Yom Kippur and I haven't eaten yet. Got some pot noodles in the ambulance? You think you're fasting today? Hop in. Nissan! Forgiven, forgiven, forgiven.
