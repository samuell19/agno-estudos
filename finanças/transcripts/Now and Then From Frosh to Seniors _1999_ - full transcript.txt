(upbeat music) - [Voiceover] Hi. - Hi! - [Voiceover] Thanks a lot. - [Voiceover] You've come to a free marketplace of ideas. The freest we can make. Because we're so devoted to that freedom we don't control the flow. That means you have to be careful evaluators. Tolerate and examine the unfamiliar but be awake to ulterior motive and resist those who prosper. Remember fondly that the task of those who teach you here is not to give you their ideas or their values but to give you the capacity and the intellectual tools to choose your own. Welcome to Stanford. (applauding) - Beautiful. Looks like home for a year. We're ready to go. - [Voiceover] I think you walked past it, Cheng. (laughting) - Really? - [Voiceover] What's your listing? John? - 116. Wait a minute. Oh, I get it. It's numbered, I was looking down this way. I mean is this going to be on film? I look like the stupid freshman. - I'm living with someone from Canada. Canada, I've never met anyone from Canada before. Oh, she's got a stereo! - Hi, I think I'm your daughter's roommate. - Hi. - I'm Sarah. - Ken - Nice to meet you. - Yeah, nice to meet you. - Mom? - [Voiceover] Yes. - Now what? - In the closet so I can get better, yeah. - Wait, there are eight girls on the floor, that means we have, and we have four showers. That's a very good ratio. - He's never been away from home. - You've got to face the fact. Growing up. - I gotta do that sometime, I guess. - I know he'll be able to handle it but, still. - Lastly to the parents, I would like to say that your children will not be overlooked or shoved aside. You are leaving your children in good, strong, and caring hands. Stanford welcomes them. - I guess the hardest thing about this day is your children are taking a step that's going to mean they're no longer children. And now is the time traditionally when we say, you know, thank you very much and it's time to go. (laughing) Nobody's moving. - Bye! - Goodbye! - Have a nice life! - [Voiceover] Nice meeting you. (laughing) - Are you Methodist? - Yeah. - Are your parents Methodist? - They are. - Now that puts it right there. I mean, people are friendly. You ask somebody who's Muslim generally it's like because their parents are Muslim. It's just what you're brought up and what your conditioned to do. - No, no, no. - And like, the reason why I am this way is because my parents have never like, given me any religious instruction. I think they're kind of Buddhist but not really. There is no Buddhist temple in the center of Ohio. (laughting) - [Voiceover] Would you be offended if I were to call you a girl now? Or refer to you as a girl, yes, would you? You would? - [Voiceover] Guys is like a nice general term there's no equivalent of the word-- - Yes there is, gals, gals! Ladies, gals! - [Voiceover] No. - Are you offended by that? - [Voiceover] Yeah. - Why? - Because the whole, there's a whole, I mean, history around ladies. It's a social conduct kind of term. I mean, your mother always told you to act like a lady you know? - [Voiceover] Maybe not you. - You could always say a little girl could be a lady, right? - I've, such major hangups, like, I really, it's deep in my head and in my heart, and in every part of me that like, having sex and talking about sex is wrong. It's just wrong. What do you feel? - Well, I don't think that there's really anything all that wrong. I mean I just, as far as I'm concerned it's human nature. There's nothing wrong with that. - I've just, I've lived in like, a strange world. I lived in an upper class neighborhood where everyone was white and then like, I don't know. A lot of people are like, Brandi's like, I don't know, they call me names and everything because... - [Voiceover] Yeah because... - I don't know they say I'm black on the outside but white in the middle and all this stuff. And I only went out with like, white guys. Oh my God, did I not get enough flack for that? Oh my God, it was the most annoying thing. God, she thinks she's white, she isn't. I don't know it's really just a weird situation. But, so, I've never really like, had black friends. It's really weird. - I mean just, like, I just think if people were religious because they're like, they're afraid to accept, you know they want a reason for everything. And there isn't, life is a big joke. I mean, there's no reason for anything. - That's a cop out. - Dream. No it's not even a dream, it just doesn't even exist. - Oh. That's 'cause we're talking about - There's just only one thing everybody can accept. This is the religion that everybody can accept. Do what you want. But try not to hurt other people. That's the only thing that everybody can accept as being morally correct. That's John Stuart Mill, my messiah. - Gals is better than ladies? Would you refer to us as say, men? - [voiceover] How 'bout a babe. - How about like, a chick? - No because I want to understand why you wouldn't just call me a woman? - Okay, I don't have a problem with calling you a woman. I just, I don't call girls, girls. - Last year I asked my mother some questions and she freaked out. She didn't just freak out, she said, I can't deal with this now. I can't deal with this. - Oh no! - And then next, no, no, the next day, she came back with a list. - Oh shit! - Number one was say no. Like, underlined three times. (laughing) You guys think I'm kidding about this? - I've always accepted it. I've never really thought twice about it. It was okay, I swing both ways. You know, before I knew any terms for it, I knew that, you know, back in kindergarten, you know, and first grade, you know, playing cooties. You know, it was just as much fun to be chased by the boys as chasing the girls. - Wow, I don't know, this is so weird and so new. I don't even know what to say anymore. - I don't think we're in Connecticut anymore. - God, I totally, wow. How did you end up like, finding, like, a boyfriend? - It's not all that difficult, at least, not where I come from, you know? It's really not all that difficult. - I don't know, I don't under... - How did you find a boyfriend? - It's just someone I went to school with for a long time and I have a long history with. - Well there you go. It's not all that different, you know? - Everyone, wow, this is the most open I've ever been. In my life, I think. (upbeat music) - I'm 18 years old, I've never been away from home and I have to take a place 2500 miles away. And I'm sure I'll be all right though. Everybody told me the first 20 minutes are the worst and I've passed that all right. - No gym class every day. - No! - No, well actually, no pledge of allegiance... - You had to do the pledge? Oh, that's horrible - During homeroom, so if we want to do that, it's on our own now. - They're going to bring back prayer at my school. - Yeah, that's... - Just a few administrative chores that need tending to. - Here's the experiment. The fact of the war made the establishment of democratic governments. - The writer begins with the senses. (foreign language) - Current fads. See it as what we might call a pre-modern version of post-modern deconstructionism. (laughing) - [Voiceover] Wow, I'm definitely the dumbest one here. - [Voiceover] Three meals a day would make me vomit. That would be disgusting. - Ready? - Cheers. Wait, okay, one, two, three. (laughing) - Okay, I know a girl with a really good body and cute face, but this picture's pretty awful. - Well then call her then, don't even show me a picture, I'll trust that. - But you know, see, because I don't know, face. I'm trying to think. I don't know anybody else. - [Voiceover] Would you go out with her? - Lilly, yeah I'd go out with her. - On a real date. As in kiss her good night. Would you be seen in public with her? - Yeah. Lilly. - Last name? - I don't know. - Get to know the girl, become a friend. Ask her out on a friendly date. Don't call her all time 'cause then you'll just scare her away. Call her until the point, when it comes to the point when she starts returning your calls. - When is that point? When that point happens, what do you know? - Then you know that there's definitely, that your chasing has gotten you somewhere. You haven't exactly captured it yet 'cause it's a girl not to be captured, you know, but what I'm... But it's just, you know, that you've gotten, you finally have gotten some feedback and she's maybe chasing you, now, too. - First of all there's that brain in a penis thing. Which I think is a major, major thing with guys. Then there's... I don't know what comes after that. I think that's pretty much it. - You know, well, I mean, I say it really doesn't matter but if I saw a really, really fine black woman dating a white guy, I'd be a little upset, I'd say. - [Voiceover] Why? - I don't know, I, upset's a strong word but I don't know, date for the person, and then, but I think marriage is a different story. You know. - This girl asked me, I went somewhere, I think to a party or something, and she goes, oh, were there any fine white guys there? Like she can't go out with a black guy or something. Or no, this is the one I can not stand is, oh, he looks good for a black guy. Like black guys are like, ugly or something. I cannot stand, oh, my gosh, that is so offensive to me. (upbeat music) - [Voiceover] Fire it down! - Five! Four, three, two, one! Drink! - [Voiceover] I can't... - Five, four, three, two! - [Voiceover] What'd she say? - She's all, oh, my God, I am so hot for you. (mixed chatter) - Did she really? - Go downstairs, she's downstairs. (ambient music) - Gotta ask her, come on. - It can't be a total win or loss there probably. - [Voiceover] Before she goes to sleep. - I told you I can't get 'em started though, I'll never see my room. It's that old like, red handkerchief thing, you know? I can't, if I get Ethan started, like, with women and everything like that, then I don't have no place to sleep, so. - [Voiceover] Bro, let's throw a party this weekend. - [Voiceover] Want me to read it? - [Voiceover] Absolutely. - I hope we're still on for tomorrow night, I'd love to be with you, it'd be the highlight of my day, Ethan. I don't know where he got this from 'cause he's gonna get ridden for it once he gets back. Everyone in the dorm. - When your mom's like, on crack, that's pretty bad. Couldn't concentrate anymore. So, I try to concentrate through an hour of working, and I don't know if I made it or not, but that... - [Voiceover] Where is your mom? - I don't know. - Is she still on drugs? - I don't know. (mumbling) She was, maybe still is, like, majorly addicted to crack. But she's been doing that shit since like, I think she started when I was 13, that's a long time to be doing something like that. All day, all night, all day, all night, all day, all night. Yeah. - [Voiceover] Is she an odd boggling? - No, no, this is, I haven't, I haven't seen her in like... How old am I, three years, two and a half years. - And she hasn't, why hasn't she contacted you? - She doesn't know where I am. I mean, she knows like, the number of where I was in Dallas, but that number's gone 'cause my dad moved, and he like, doesn't like her at all. I think that might have been why... - I don't think that's right, how did they even find... - They weren't married. - They weren't? - No, she's married to my brother's dad still. - Your dad and then your mom were never married? You're kidding. Your mom was married to another guy when... - [Voiceover] She fucked my dad, yeah. - Well, I didn't wanna know, you blared that, so. - Well, that's what happened. So, I wonder if she stopped, I wonder if she... Gained any weight, wonder if she has a job, I wonder what she's doing. I wonder if she thinks about me. (upbeat music) - [Voiceover] Hello. - Hi Jane, how are you? - [Voiceover] Good, how are you? - I'm doing fine. So, what are you gonna write on? - [Voiceover] I was gonna write on pray, the images of women. - Okay. - And I was gonna write on Christine Noo-Pee-Sawn, and Chaw-Ser. But I don't know, I'm kind of confused. Well, I don't know, I was gonna ask you about this. I wanted to take different types of love for each character, using chapters two, three, four, and a little bit of six. Like, I outlined like, different sections that talk about like, how he, his like, like, basically him being slowed down by An-Kee-Sis, hat's his dad, right? - Debbie, you're blathering. Can I start repeating that? Why does he commit sin? - 'Cause he's evil, 'cause, not just because he's a man, I don't... What do you mean? - Let's talk about, for instance, the woman down in Naples, and the story event that I knew, okay, what sort of bad consequences happened to the hooker down there in Naples because she's, you know, flim flam, this poor country bumpkin? - What happens to her? She... What did happen? I forgot now. - You know why you can't figure anything bad that happened to her? Nothing bad happens to her. Okay? Now, that's interesting, just suppose Dante would have written that story. - I'm so confused. I'm so confused. - I mean, I was smart for high school, for my high school. Maybe not even smart, maybe just a hard worker. We'll find out. (contemplative music) - [Voiceover] Yeah, I reached my academic peak in like, fifth grade. - [Voiceover] My dad stressed education in such a major way, which was, well, he just always told me, work hard and what you want is yours. Like, even if the system is making you work harder than certain other people, if you work hard, you get what you want. - [Voiceover] I'm losing my discipline fast. It's just, there's so many things to do. Things that are, even where you get immediate, instant gratification, which I don't exactly get from right now. - Basically... Scrambling for an essay. - [Voiceover] You having trouble? - Yeah. - [Voiceover] 'Cause the question says, wait, what does the question say again? - What extent do humans have... A power to order their lives? - [Voiceover] What's it say after that? - Discuss. - [Voiceover] Why the fuck are we reading, this asshole is always wrong. I just, I think that if Aristotle were black, we wouldn't be reading it. Especially since he's always wrong. Or if he were a woman, I don't think we'd be reading. Especially since he's always wrong. (laughing) - [Voiceover] What is that? - I don't know. - [Voiceover] Break it, great. (mixed chatter) - How do I turn it off? - [Voiceover] Just press the... - [Voiceover] Let's just trim these margins. See? We'll just do a half an inch, it's not noticeable. - [Voiceover] That is... - [Voiceover] Ah, come on. Oh, yeah. Four pages. - [Voiceover] How's it going? - Well, I've run up against this big wall for some reason, I haven't been able to do much in the last hour or so. (machine printing) - We have to write 10 papers. Yeah. - At least you don't have to do 'em. (birds squawking) (upbeat music) - Well, like, I was thinking he can't give me an F because I wrote, right? Right, there's like pages filled up, so he couldn't give me an F. - [Voiceover] When do you turn it in? - I don't know, when we go there tonight, I guess we're gonna finish it and see. Well, there is just any way I can like, slip it under his door or something. (contemplative music) Good. (heart beating) (upbeat music) (cheering) - A lot of my social life is based outside of the dorm. You know, there is certainly a very tight community here, or at least, I can see one developing. But for, you know, for me personally, having friends that are rural in ID is sort of a new experience, actually. I have a tendency to forget that there are a lot of other places besides the city, LA, Seattle, New York. You know, there are a lot of other people from a lot of different places with a lot of different attitudes. You know, I don't even really think about it, I go and I do what I do, and if it shocks people, I guess it shocks people, you know? I've got other things to worry about. Exciting night here back at the ranch. - Of course. I actually might watch the score play volleyball. My rural team, they lost. Then it went to pipe 12 people in the chest, and the forerunner went to Jack in the Box, so you know, just general college kid craziness, you know what I'm saying? - It really doesn't matter to me, like, people like, say that, you know, what's it like being around Nick? And I really don't care, you know? 'Cause I mean, I may think it's wrong, but you know, it doesn't seem right, but I mean, it still doesn't bother me. - How would you feel if he brought home, like, a gay friend that, does that make you uncomfortable? - [Voiceover] I am really uncomfortable. - Yeah. - [Voiceover] I don't think he'd get that. - Say he somehow at least, leave a note on the door, like, don't come in, or something like that. - He hasn't talked about that? - That's kinda just the same thing as if you brought, if, you know, if JD brought home his girlfriend or something. But just having a girl is much more natural to deal with. I mean, if Jason had his girlfriend here, it'd be easy for everyone to be like, oh, Jason, your girlfriend's pretty cute, and be like, all right, Jason, but like, if Nick brought back a guy, like, people wouldn't wanna, I mean, you wouldn't know what to say, you would be like, Nick, that's a pretty cute guy you got. I mean, that would be really, like, I mean, I don't Know, it'd be really uncomfortable, you just, no one would talk about it. Seems to be a little more unnatural situation, obviously. - [Voiceover] Little tenser. - Yeah. - [Voiceover] I think. (upbeat music) (yelling) - [Voiceover] How could they do that? - Hey, that's not PC, man. - Huh? - That's not PC. - What, this isn't? - Yeah, you crushed it. - I mean, the only motivation I could see them having is for attention, I mean, why else would you wanna do that, I can't, I can't figure it out, so. - I don't know, it's really upsetting me. For you to Berkeley here. - If those people wanna go do that, they can go do it, that's fine. I just... I guess I don't think it should be in the current is all. - You wouldn't be willing to say that it should be a white man and a white woman on the front because most of the people there were white men and white women, right? You wouldn't be willing to say that. Yeah, so, it's, I mean, it's the same kinda, it's the same kind of thing. - [Voiceover] He is so homophobic. He is. - It's so scary. He said, and I quote, he said, I can't believe this to us, the general public. They shouldn't have put on there, it's not the majority. What else was he saying? He was saying that there are people on this picture, people on the front page who aren't like him, and hence, it shouldn't be there. That's so... That's so dark. (laughing) That really is. - He said that? I gotta have a word with him, man, I gotta hear it from, I can't believe that. - [Voiceover] Makes me so mad. - And then homosexuals that night were essentially a minority, just like she is a minority because she's black. And she was just mad because you said they're the minority, so they shouldn't be representing the whole group on the front, you know? I don't know, just because people aren't comfortable with it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. - What it mostly comes down to is that, personally, I'm insecure. - [Voiceover] Yeah, but if a lot of people are insecure, what's gonna change that? I mean, what's gonna improve the situation? I think that's a definite part of, you know, American culture that, I mean, people don't always like to, you know, face up to it or whatever, or be around, but it doesn't mean it doesn't exist, you know? - You're right, you're absolutely right, what am I gonna, you're absolutely right. You did it, Ame. Is that what you wanna hear? - [Voiceover] No. No. - I don't know what to say. - Well, what do you think? I mean, tell me what you think, you said you don't like it. - Yeah. But that's wrong to think that. (choral chanting music) - [Congregation] We believe in one holy Catholic and Apostolic church. We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. - I was in my own church, and I was reading this bulletin, and it was about like, homosexuality, and it was like, and it defined it, like, it was right there, it's like, homosexuality is an abnormal form of behavior. And I was like, what? You know, I'm like, and so, I don't know. But I don't know why I'm still a Catholic, you know? Like, with it's like, you know, view on abortion, and the whole hierarchy of the church, and, when only men can be priests, and only, I mean, I remember being a little kid, and like, I was really disillusioned 'cause I was all into, like, I liked going to church, and you know, I was all into it. And I wanted to be an altar boy. You know, and I went up, and I asked my mom, like, I wanna be an altar boy, and my mom's like, you can't be an altar boy. And I was like, why not? And she couldn't really explain to me a good reason, so she made me, she arranged this special meeting between me and the deacon to discuss why I couldn't be an altar boy. And this like, and I don't know, I was always really jealous, I was like, wait, why can they do it, and I can't do it? (upbeat music) I'm starting to realize that I have more of a say in like, whether I stay in the church or whether I don't. But I think for me to really feel secure away from the church, and the traditions that I've had there, I would have to find something to replace it, and I really haven't found anything yet. - For me, it's not like we're all, Asians are superior, and I don't wanna hang out with anybody else, but the thing is is there are a lot of like, common experiences people, like, a lot of us can relate with. Strict parents. Like, living in a foreign culture at home. Being teased at in elementary school, that's just that kind of idea. Do you go out, like, with you know, like, Asian girls and all that, or do you like... - Okay, put me on the spot. Okay, I guess I generally tend towards Caucasian girls. - Really? - That's right, you're from Kansas. Hey, I was born in Kansas, it's okay. It's not like, what it would like, seem to be. It's like, partly your parents, and where you grow up. You're gonna marry a nice Chinese girl. - Yeah, I got that a lot, too. - [Voiceover] This was... - I feel, you know, and like, just wanna be with somebody that can relate. - Yeah, but I personally think I'd be able to relate, well, yeah, they're cute, but saying that, I think I'd be able to relate more with a, well, I don't know, it's just that as I'm almost pure American, you know, and my attitudes and such, I don't really see a whole lot of traditional Korean values in myself. And so, I can't really relate to that. And so, I generally tend to relate better with Caucasian girls. - I think I have some Chinese values, yeah. I think so. But it's like, my parents are like... (mumbling) The Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese, that's okay for me, like, that's okay. I think they tolerate white people. They could accept me marrying somebody that was like, Caucasian, but she'd have to come from like, a very conservative family. - [Voiceover] How do you feel about your first date at Stanford? - My first date, well, it's pretty sad 'cause it's totally set up. So, that's not quite an achievement, but I guess technically, it's still a date, yeah. But it's like, I mean, I've never had like, this like, totally arranged for me like this. - It sounds good to your date. Totally surprised. - Is it like, Connie Chung or something like that? Connie Chung, yes, she's left Maury Povich for me. Man. - Okay, is she cute, would you say she's kinda cute? Really, and she's really nice? Okay. Does she have a big butt? (laughing) - Who do you define as having a big butt? - See, it's so hard to tell because the thing is is that like, I'll see girls in here, and they look, their picture looks pretty, but I know them, and they're really ugly. - No, it should be big. As in like, tall. - Stupid. What do you do? - Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T , S, R, Q. - [Voiceover] Isn't that a pain? - [Voiceover] No, not at all. I like cuff links. - Caroline? - [Voiceover] Yeah. - [Voiceover] I don't know. - [Voiceover] I think she went upstairs. - No problem, I don't look overdressed, yet I still look better than that guy. I don't look overdressed, but I still look better than that guy, no problem. No problem. I do not feel overdressed now, I feel confident. (mixed chatter) - [Voiceover] Oh, my goodness. - [Voiceover] Oh, Chang's all out. - Oh, wow. - [Voiceover] Did we pick a winner or what? - Hey. - Might wanna take that. Wanna take a... - Seriously, did you know? - No, I did not know, I didn't wanna find out. - Well, any idiot can get a date arranged for them. (laughing) I'm serious, I mean, not that Chang's an idiot, but I mean, this is like... Well, the whole fun of the date is the object of your pursuit, and you're pursuing it, and you get the ego trip that goes along with it. See, you're a man, it's your object, you are the hunter, you pursue your game. Get your game, you go home, get satisfied, that's the way it goes. - [Voiceover] Talking realistically, I mean, do you guys, will you guys generally make the first move? - No. - Or no? - No, I need, I will make preliminary, you know, okay, to use a basketball analogy, okay? Okay? I'll push the ball up the court, but if there's nobody running the break with me, then I'm gonna pull it back, pull it on back. - Here's what I say. There's a time when the point guard must pull the ball back out, reset the offense. It's okay to attempt a three pointer, a long shot with a big pay off, if it is within the structure of the offense, you're squared up to the basket, you're ready to shoot the ball. Off balance three pointers usually don't go in, and you get embarrassed. You get taken out of the game. All I want is a girlfriend, just once. - What? - I just want a girlfriend just once. That too much to ask? - [Voiceover] You've never had a girlfriend? - It's no big deal, I had fun in high school. Nothing to worry about. Nothing, nobody to call and like, waste time. Nobody to like... Who am I kidding? It'll be all right. - [Voiceover] Yeah, it definitely will be. - It's first quarter. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) - Litigation strategies that are possible to address issues of poverty and wealth are very different than those that can address race or gender discrimination. It has to do with a discussion of white and black movement as distinguished from everybody else in America. - [Voiceover] Is Aristotle evil? I mean, I don't think you wanna say that Aristotle is evil because that would go on to perpetuate oppressive ideas. I mean, but you also don't wanna say that Aristotle is stupid. What would a feminist, if he had a feminist perspective back then, what would that mean? (mumbling) 'Cause all of these movements, like, the radical feminism, socialist, feminist, they're saying almost like, men are hopeless, you know, we women just have to get together, you know, be separate, do something, you know, and that is not gonna solve anything. You have to raise consciousness, you have to change the men, change people, you know what I mean? - If your objective is to raise consciousness, because I mean, what angle do you start at, you know? Where do you start? (giggling) - [Voiceover] The things that I did. Yes or no? - [Voiceover] Fooled me. - [Voiceover] No, no, Gerardo, seriously, will you take them down? - Why do you want me to take them down? - [Voiceover] Because, 'cause... - Don't tell me they offend you, seriously? - They do offend me, they offend me so much. Every time I go there. - [Voiceover] Why didn't you ever say anything? - I comment about them every time I'm there. Every time. How would you feel like, talking to me in my room with a picture of a guy with a really big dick hanging out? - [Voiceover] I'd probably just make fun of you, but I don't think it would raise how... - You wouldn't feel uncomfortable talking to me with a dick hanging in the way? - I can see you feeling uncomfortable with the, if you walk into my room, and you're talking to me, and I have a chick that's half naked in there. - But you do. - But it's a poster. - Something that's obviously racist should be suppressed, something that's obviously sexist should be, you know? - I just basically completely disagree with you. - And it offends the shit out of me, but I can't say, look, you can't hang what you want to on your house. I mean, I know I, 'cause I can't, I don't know, I just can't say, oh, 'cause I'm offended by that, you have to be, too, I can't. - It's not even that you're offended by that, you may be hurt by that, you know? Like, if that's projecting attitudes to other people. - But yet, you're gonna have a group of people, they're gonna decide where the line should be drawn. Like, how do you draw the line? - I don't know, it's a really fuzzy line, and I still don't know where it cuts off, I don't like, claim to know that. But I know that it has to cut off somewhere because... - This is kinda like a sick thought in itself, but if there wasn't like, racism, or sexism, or any of that sort of stuff, Shayne, what would you talk about? - Like, what would make your life interesting? - Do you realize that sexism is like, a personal problem for me, like, 'cause I'm a woman? So, like, sexism is a personal problem. (upbeat music) - Sam. - Debbie. - Do you feel like you're at a loss at the school, being a white male? - I'm a what? - At a loss. - At a loss at school, being a white male? - Yeah. - Absolutely not. - Do you feel like at any other place, you would be, like, getting a job, you would be? - That I'm at a loss? - [Voiceover] Yeah. - What do you mean, like, discriminated against, or? - [Voiceover] Like... - Or I don't understand things? - Like, if you were a color, or like, from a different country, it would be easier to get into this school, or it would be easier to get into... - A little bit, well, no, not really. I think you're still at the, I mean, as much as they like to crowd up on the culture, there's still a lot of white males here. - So, like, when you hear people like, protesting, and people like, asking for like, multicultural houses, and more integrated education, it doesn't bother you at all? - I think they have as much right to be different as I do from them. - Yeah, of course they do, I just, I mean, I think they hate you though. - [Voiceover] They hate me. - They hate you. - [Voiceover] Well, that's too bad 'cause I don't hate them. - Well, that's one, but I mean, I'm not saying that each and everyone does, but I think that's part of their group, that's part of their structure of their group. - I don't think they all hate me. Do you think all women hate me? - Yeah. - [Voiceover] Really? (upbeat music) (mixed chatter) - And I really hate to beg. - Hi, are you pro choice? - [Voiceover] Yes! - Are you a California voter? Come back here and visit us. - You can think of them like pants, you know? Like tights and sweats do a perfectly good job of pants when you're exercising. They feel a hell of a lot different, and one is a lot tighter than the other, but they both work. That's the same thing with condoms. A lot of it is just how it feels, but every condom, it should be able to fit you no matter what size you are. And there are classic ways of showing this actually. I use the two handed technique, which is what I will teach you, I discovered it's the easiest way. Now here's what you do from profile, right? You flip from the head, from the front, back to the front, over the ears, and then blow. - [Voiceover] Yes! - Why is it a blow job when there's no blowing involved? - [Voiceover] I don't know. - [Voiceover] I know, it should be a suck job, shouldn't it? - Yeah, it should be a suck job. - [Voiceover] We know that. - It would be rude to spit out, and therefore, swallowing is, you know, a whole part of the love making process. - Kinda the ending post etiquette. - Yeah, exactly. - I thought love making involved feeling good. Swallowing that shit does not make one feel good. Well, I guess maybe I don't know, but, makes me feel sick just thinking about it. - And then as far as I'm concerned, if I were... - [Voiceover] Be smart! - If I were... - Be smart! Don't say something you'll regret. - [Voiceover] Say it, Scott! - I personally think that, I don't think I'd have respect for anyone that would be able to do that. Therefore I wouldn't care, you know? - Interesting angle. - I wouldn't let someone I love, like... - Swallow. - Yeah. Or even be in a position to intake anything. - I doubt that. - [Voiceover] I'm serious. - I don't know, all guys that say they don't like it and all that, that's a lie. That is a lie. - [Voiceover] What? What is a lie? - You'll see Scott, when it happens, you'll find out, oh, I was lying. Anyway. - [Voiceover] Yes! (upbeat music) - Well, I don't know, how much is this? 1.75 liters, what's conversion? - It's wine coolers, aren't wine coolers six percent? - [Voiceover] Five percent. - What's the conversion, does anybody know? So, it's gonna make one shimmer? - [Voiceover] Well, I don't think it's oregano. - We need two quarts. - Just pour it in here. - How do you spell alcohol? A L? - [Voiceover] A L C H. - Seriously, how do you spell it? - [Voiceover] C O H O L. - [Voiceover] I think it's to run out of the bottle of vodka. - [Voiceover] Hang on. - Hang on, hang on, I'll get the ratio. Oh, dude, we need three liters of vodka. (mixed chatter) - [Voiceover] Look at that worm, just sliding around a worm. Oh, from mixed... (hollering) (reggae music) (upbeat music) - [Voiceover] Oh, yeah. (mumbling) - Yes, you guys. (ambient music) - One, two! - [Voiceover] Hey! - [Voiceover] You're really into this. - [Voiceover] Megan, watch out. - Oh, my God. - Don't blow on me, Johnny. Gymnastics. Ow! Shit, I'm rolling. - Oh, that sucked. - That sucked, dude. - [Voiceover] His head's in the toilet, but he'll be fine. - Pray, pray to the gods! - Pray to them! - [Voiceover] It hurts so good! (mixed chatter) - You need Topol. - The smoker's. Wait, don't sit there. He's not good. - It's much too late to go to bed. - [Voiceover] Good morning. - [Congregation] By the power of the holy spirit, he was born of the virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake, he was crucified under Pontius Pilate. He suffered, died, and was buried. On the third day, he rose again in fulfillment of the scriptures. (mumbling) (upbeat music) (mixed chatter) - [Voiceover] This is, this is your section, I think, and the afternoon section is over there on the table. - Yes, Brandi? - [Voiceover] Woo! - I'm so stoked. - [Voiceover] I'm not looking in front of you guys. - [Voiceover] Comments are on the back there. - All right, thanks. Oh, looks like this is the one I'm gonna drop. I thought it was gonna be really easy coming here, and then I'm like, whoa. Whoa, these people are really smart. It's really scary. I'm doing okay, I guess, I mean, I mean, even though I like, even though I like, I came off the waiting list, you know, it's like... Well, I think I'm like, at least in the top third. - I did double check as I told you I would on what the situation was as far as the chemistry of people were concerned, and they said that at this point, given the two tests that you took, at this point, you are at a D. - A D? - [Voiceover] Right. - [Voiceover] But you finished all of your papers? - Yeah, I finished all of them. - [Voiceover] And did you get them back? - Yeah. - [Voiceover] And what kinds of... - I got an A minus on the one, but it went to a B plus because I turned it in late. And I got a B on one. - Wait a minute, you turned it in late, and you had an A minus, but you turned it in late. - [Voiceover] I turn them in, I always turn them in late, though, always, I turned in one on time this whole year. - Monique, did you have it done on time? - I had most of it done, actually. - [Voiceover] Why did you turn it in late then? - I don't know, I didn't, I just didn't, 'cause I fell asleep. - I don't detect a grounds well of enthusiasm for taking another chemistry course, do I? - No, I have to. - [Voiceover] You have to? - Yeah, for the pre-med, I have to. - [Voiceover] Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry, yes, of course. Yes, yes, well. Okay, other than that, what were you gonna do for fun that next quarter? - Nothing. I don't, I have no room for any fun. - [Voiceover] Now, now, would I mean is something that you don't have to do in that, you have to arrive at a certain amount of pressure from. - I have no room for fun. - I'll see, but I really got an A minus. - [Voiceover] But no, it doesn't count, I mean, you got an A minus, but what good was that if you, if the grade shows up as a B plus? I mean, it feels good 'cause you know you did A minus work. - Yeah, that's... - [Voiceover] But doesn't that make you feel bad that you did A minus work, but you're only gonna get credit for a B plus? - No, that doesn't make me feel bad? - That doesn't? No, but it still starts you getting into bad habits so that now, it's a civ paper, later on, it'll be your financial aid form, and then you don't get financial aid because you forgot to, or you turned it in late. (phone ringing) - I seem, I get tired, I get mentally tired. I mean, it happened to me like, last, last year at Christmas break or whatever. I'm having major problems with my dad, and I got really tired, then I was in Oakland, and my mom doing all her drugs, I got, I would get really tired. - I believe it that a lot of people that stop out don't come back. - Yeah, but I would though 'cause I want to be here. It's, I want, I don't know, it's not like I don't like it here, I don't wanna be here, I love it, I mean, this is like the best place ever, I cannot see myself anywhere else. It's just that the timing, it just seems so wrong. There's so much going on. I know it's not right for me right now, and I know that for a fact 'cause I'm just so unmotivated, I know it, but no one will believe me, no one, oh, no, you don't wanna do that, you're motivated, well fuck you, if I'm motivated, why the fuck am I saying I'm not? - [Voiceover] Well, no matter, if you go and work, you're gonna have to do shit you don't wanna do, and see, the difference is gonna be worse, 'cause if you don't wanna do it, then you're gonna get your ass fired, and you're gonna be out in the fucking street. No matter what you do in this world, no matter what you do in this world, you always have to do stuff you don't wanna do, that's part of life, that's, I mean, that's what it's all about is being able to accept the fact that some things are, you have to do. Even if you don't want to. Do you think I wanna go up and read 240 pages of Dante tonight? I think not. I think I'd rather go to sleep, but I have to. - I know when I'm really tired, and I'm not gonna do anything, and it's just better if I just stop, and take a break, and start all over again. - Okay, I'm sorry. If you leave, I'm gonna have to kill you. Okay, I mean, I will have to, I will like, hunt you down. I will chase you around the country, and I will kill you. - I'll come back. - No, no, see, you're not going anywhere. (upbeat music) - What's going to be on this exam? Well, I can't tell you that, but I can tell you, let me, let me tell you how to approach this exam. This is a question we asked last year, this is one of the two that they got to choose from. European society in the later middle ages from 1000 to 1340 was clearly based on the principle of hierarchy. Discuss the effect of hierarchical ordering on the political, social, religious, and intellectual life of this period. What events, movements, or systems of thought presented a challenge to this order? Now, if you were to get a question like that, I know you'll panic right now because you have no idea, but come Monday after you've spent the next four or five days going over this material, that will be an easy question to answer. In the notes, in these cliff notes, it says, it is significant that Augustine approaches his non-god exclusively through his inner experience. - Marx defines equality in terms of economics. But one of his main points are that people are inherently unhappy. - Black studies starts a new lay revolution of scientific humanism. (electric guitar music) - I'm gonna kick your ass if you draw on me. What? What is your problem? You're not drawing on me. What? Let me fuckin' study. - [Voiceover] The current duty undergoes under text division 'cause it's in 15 minutes. Read my very stats, and the low division will remain open until tonight. * Sooner or later * You just got to let go * Trust that you know enough * And it's all that you'll ever know * So when it's passing midnight * Put your pencil away * My advice for you, buckaroo * Is to get on your knees and pray * Whoa, and pray * One, two, three, four * You gotta pray to the god of partial credit * Get on your knees and pray * You gotta pray to god of partial credit * Whoa, chunky wave * Chemistry, and calculus, and poly sci alike * There's only one way to get it right * You gotta pray to the God of partial credit * Get on your knees and pray, God, pray * - We're not expecting highly polished methods. On the other hand, we're not expecting bullshit, right? (ambient music) * Oh, God, of partial credit * Please let this poor boy pass * Take me up over that meteor * Or my ass is grass - Were they communes? - [Voiceover] Yeah. - Yes, yes, yes. * Pray, pray * Pray * It's the only way (cheering) - I think it might be it for pre-med, too. I think I'm starting to get, adopt a new way of thinking. Like, it was easy to get through high school that way, saying, you know, well, I'm not gonna enjoy these years because I'm going for college. Like, and then what am I gonna do? Am I gonna say that for all my years at college, too? You know, not enjoy them just because I, you know, med school is more important than enjoying them at this time. - I don't want people out there in the documentary, them knowing that I'm stupid. - [Voiceover] You're not stupid, no one's gonna ever think you're stupid. - They're gonna think I'm stupid, wow, what a dumb guy, he failed a class. - You know that D stands for dickhead. - I'm sick of this place, I like the people, I like this dorm, but I'm just sick of this place. I'm transferring. - [Voiceover] What brought all this on? - What? - [Voiceover] Why are you saying? - I'm sick of all these people being smarter than me, I can't handle it. - Chang, get over it. (piano music) - Seriously, these people are. I'm transferring. Miami University for me. It's number two for women, it's rated number two. - [Voiceover] Do you think you wanna stick it out for the year? - I wanna go home. But I'll stick it out just because I'm a stick it out kind of person. Just because it's what I've been doing all my life is sticking it out. Sticking it out. So I don't know anything else, that's why. (mixed chatter) - [Voiceover] Bye Sam. - Bye Sam. - [Voiceover] Sam, if I don't even see you again. - [Voiceover] If you die, Sam, I want your dog tags. - If I don't see you again, Sam. - [Voiceover] Wow, he cleaned up his room, too. (upbeat music) - Hi, can I help you? - [Voiceover] Two. - Two? This way, please. (foreign language) - [Voiceover] That was pretty funny, mom. - [Voiceover] What? - Mom, you have soap all over your face. - I'm proud of you. - Yeah, did you sleep last night? - [Voiceover] No. - Yo. - I see you found the washer, dryer? - [Voiceover] I made sure I never washed my clothes just so... - [Voiceover] It's comfy inside. (video game music) - Yeah, right, it's out of bounds! - [Boys] Air ball. - Air ball, air ball! - [Voiceover] Hey, how are you? - [Voiceover] Great, how are you? - [Voiceover] Good. - I'm really tired. Studying is rough. - Is it everything you thought it would be? - Yeah, and more. - Your grades are good? - Yeah, okay, I'm doing okay. Gotta work even harder next quarter, try and adjust. It's adjusting. - Do you have an idea what your grades will be? - A's and B's. - A's and B's, well, I don't think that's gonna need to be changed. - Not straight A's, got a few B's in there. - Hey, there's no problem with that. - [Voiceover] Yeah, and college is a lot different. - Oh, yeah, how's Cal State? - It's windy, and it's cold, and, a lot of chicks, but... - A lot of chicks? - Yeah, but... I mean, it's, college is a lot different than high school, but it's not hard, I mean, I've been waiting for it for 12 years. - There, put your hand on this, or... - [Voiceover] It is nice to get home 'cause you feel so safe here, you know? You just, people know you already. - [Voiceover] You can't go over his back like that. That's a foul. Oh. - [Voiceover] What do you hope that Chang gets out of college? - Well. All I want is that he find a nice girl, marry, and happy. - Hey, you want that, you'd better get me a car. - Now, chill out for two days, Scott. - [Voiceover] Chill out for two days. - For two days. - [Voiceover] Chill out for two days? - That cold will stay with you until you rest and build up your resistance. You know, he gets home, and boom, bam, the phone's start ringing, and he's gone. And that is, his social life is number one. - [Voiceover] I wanna quit seeing her as mom. You know, I don't need a disciplinarian, or a lecturer, but I need support. - My tactic is always keep your options open. You know, do something... - Even if that means closing off some other options? Say I'm keeping my options open with a history major, that's closing off something else. I mean, it's closing off being a feminist studies major, you know what I'm saying? - I guess what we mean is you have to take a realistic view of what your lifestyle is going to be like, you know, if you're simply comfortable with thinking you're going to like that, then go ahead, but... - So, like, it would be all right with you if I came back, and I said, well, I'm perfectly fine with a feminist studies major because I'm not going to grad school, I'm going to work for a political activist group in Washington, a feminist group, a special interest group. I won't be making a lot of money, but I'll be happy with it. - So, is that what you're saying? I think temporarily, certainly. - [Voiceover] What do you mean temporarily? - I don't think you could do that for a life time, we know not people that are hippies at age 52, it's not becoming, you know? (ambient music) - Remember those who aren't with us. There's to the present. Remember those who are with us. And here's to the future. - Hey. * Holy night - [Voiceover] Why? - [Voiceover] I don't care. (upbeat music) - It's exciting to go to Stanford. - [Voiceover] Really? - Stanford is my home. - [Voiceover] Did you think you would say that before you came back here this time? - No. But then I got out of the little car, and I said, sheesh, I need to go back home. It's been the longest three weeks of my life. - What three weeks? - These three weeks they called break. - Hi. - Hi, welcome back. - Well, you welcome back, too, how was your break? - Oh< it was okay, it was pretty good. - Hi. - We love you more than your real family does. - It's true. They were like, see ya. - Hi, yay! Oh, I miss everybody so much. - Hey, what's up, dude. - [Voiceover] Hey, Gerardo, welcome back. - Thanks. - It's nice walking down the street back to the dorm, and knowing that I'm gonna walk into a room, and it's, you know, I live there, but my father is, you know, miles, and miles, and miles away. * And out, and stand * By me, oh * Stand by me * Oh, stand, oh, stand * Stand by me, stand by me * Won't you, won't you stand by me * - And quite honestly, I don't wanna talk to you anymore, 'cause you know, we always get in these ideological arguments, and we can't change each other's minds, and we just get more and more pissed off, so. - I'm not getting pissed off at all. - [Voiceover] It's just, this is something that I feel very emotional about, and I just don't wanna end up hating you for two or three days. - It's such bullshit, I'm trying to have an open mind. I have an open mind about as much as I can, okay? - I do, I told you that, like, Jacob, when I went to bed... - Unreal, I hate this. - I really don't care what you have to say. - [Voiceover] I would say that I'm a much more committed person now than I was when I came here. Like, if someone says something, it can really offend me, and it really hurts, whereas, before, I used to be able to dismiss it, and it didn't mean as much to me. Like, I've always had an objection to like, some of the things that the church did. But I still went to church every Sunday, and then I come here, and there's more of a sense that as I'm sitting in there, and you know, reading these readings about, you know, the role of women, and obeying their husbands, and stuff, it starts to affect me more, you know? I'm starting to realize that for many years, those readings have affected people. - [Congregation] Jesus Christ. - I wish, like, I didn't have a problem with it. Like, every time I went to church and heard something, you know, like, the lecture we heard, like, last week, you know, and like, it didn't bother me, but it does. Like, going to church, you like, feel that you have like, something there, you know? Like you're doing something concrete that makes you feel like you're doing something out of the ordinary for like, someone other than yourself. Even though I'm not really sure who I'm doing it for, you know? You know it's not really for yourself, but I guess it is kind of. - [Voiceover] Do you think there's something else that could take the place? - Probably, but not like something like, I could share with my family anymore. Like, I think that's my biggest problem with it. I don't know. It's hard to like, grow up Catholic, and then like, break off from it. (knocking) - [Voiceover] Happy valentines day! - Come on, Rebecca. - I don't know what has to be done at 6:30 in the morning that can't be done at 11 o'clock. Or 12 o'clock, or one o'clock. - She made a good point, you know, valentines day lasts all day. (mixed chatter) - 6:30 in the fucking morning, everyone's fucking pounding on the door, wake up. - [Voiceover] How come you're not downstairs? - I hate valentines day. I don't like waking up this early, I think it's evil that anyone would force anyone else to wake up this early just to eat a fucking cock, they can. Besides that, I have a mid term, which means I need all the preparation I can get. At least if I fail, I'll look good doing it. (mumbling) - Wasn't there four a second ago? It doesn't matter. I won't eat two of them anyways. - Well, which one do you want? - Oh, so you would eat all three? - If you're not gonna eat two. - I don't know, I might not even eat one. Just eat 'til you drop, and then I'll pick up if there's still some left. - [Voiceover] Yeah, but neither of us is gay, so. - [Voiceover] Well, I know, but I'm just saying, I know how that develops. I mean, that people just start talking about things, and making assumptions, and drawing conclusions. Like, oh, well, those two were out together last night, I wonder what they were doing, you know, just stupid things like that. - My main concern is just to stop, and try not to make anybody mad, or make anybody resentful, 'cause all that's gonna do is make it worse. - Why should we go in there explain how good of buddies we are to him? How about going in there and asking him, why is it so wrong for two friends to hang around each other? - I want to have a personal conversation with him one on one 'cause maybe a little bit will get through to him, and I think, I'm trying to come up with an effective way to stop them from being. - We tried your way already, how about trying mine this way? How about having faith in what I'm talking about? Obviously, you haven't dealt with anything like this, and you still think that, oh, they're gonna be sitting, reasonable people. - You know, I've been hearing all these things, and I don't understand why you guys would go around saying stuff like that because one, you guys both know that we, neither of us, either of us is gay. Two, I don't understand why you guys have such a big problem with us being such good friends. - I've seen close friends before, I've had a lot of close friends. But I've never like, taken showers with my close friend. - [Voiceover] Not even when you worked out, like, if you were in high school, if you were in sports, like, say football or whatever? - Well, see, I usually, we usually went home to take a shower. Well, after football games, we did, but the lights were off, we didn't really talk, you just take a shower, and then get out of there. I've got another question. You know, you guys cut each other's hair, right? - [Voiceover] Yeah. - But I understand that you don't wanna wear a t-shirt 'cause you'll get hair all over it, but why don't you wear your pants or your shorts? Why do you just wear your towel? - If we were at the barbers, of course we're gonna wear clothes, we're not gonna wear our towel, but that's a little bit more convenient to just wear a towel, then go in the shower, and take off the hair. Don't you think that makes sense? - All right, let me get this, you can just put it like this, it falls off. - Okay, well. - But they're the little things that you guys do that make us talk like that, 'cause I mean, I don't know if this is true, but someone told me that he takes naps in your bed with his shirt off. - Oh, my God, how fucking stupid is that? Give me a break. It's like you guys were making a case from nothing. I mean, do you honestly think that if either of us were gay, we'd wanna display it? I mean, show it off? - Not at all. People respect Nick for whatever decision he makes, but people, you know, I don't know what you heard, or what rumors you hear, and why you think I'm spreading rumors, but the people are saying, wait a minute, I mean, if you guys are, we'd have a lot more respect for you if you did. - But see, that's the whole point, we aren't, and that was already established. - Tell everyone this, everyone that you... - See, the whole point that I don't understand is I shouldn't have to go justify my friendship with anyone. - I mean, hey, I'm happy for you, if that's what you want, I mean, if that's what, if you enjoy your friendship, like, obviously you do, that's great. - I don't know, I still don't, you're talking to me forever, but I'm still gonna feel your relationship is very odd. I've never seen anything like it. Even though you both have seen this before, I doubt I will ever see it again for the rest of my life. (upbeat music) - We came to a realization about our problems on our way over here. We're too deep about everything, and like... - Too analytical. - Yeah, too analytical, and like, we put all these conditions on things like friendship, and stuff like that. We've got this like, like, idea of what it should be. - Why does everybody have to be so analytical? - I just think it's kinda weird that I went through high school, I didn't have one major like, fight where like, I would stop talking to someone, or I'd stop like, being someone's friend because of an incident or something like that. At least one person, you know, is like, really depressed every day, and that's kind of abnormal, you know, where there's someone mad at someone every day. Hey, Susie. - They're freaks, everyone's so insecure about everything. And they can't just relax. - You got this, actually, this actually makes your zits kinda come out. You know, so... - [Voiceover] Oh, you are gonna have all zits. - Oh, great. - But then it brings them out, and then they go away. - Yeah, don't let Nick see me 'cause I always give him shit for wearing masks. - [Voiceover] What'd you do? - What the hell's going on here? - [Voiceover] Oh, Sammy, hey, you're next. - Oh, I am? - [Voiceover] Yeah. - Oh, yeah? - [Voiceover] I should what? - [Voiceover] Brush it. - [Voiceover] Oh, no, they would have liked me a lot better. This is just your color, too. - Oh, I'm sure it is. - No laughing. - Sorry. - I just gotta pick up some saltines. What happened? (ambient music) - [Voiceover] If only they could see you now. - [Voiceover] If only my father could see me now. - If we had a camera, use your camera. - If we had a camera. - I mean, like, a camera that like, you could have a picture. - Carrie, did you do this? - No, no, don't let him in here. - Who did this, Carrie, did you do this? You are a goddess. Awesome. I'm so psyched. - All right, that's it, I'm coming out of the closet, I wear masks. And I don't care who knows it. - [Voiceover] You can't laugh, listen, don't distract it. - [Voiceover] What are you saying? - [Voiceover] Don't laugh, don't laugh. - I'm, so it's like, oh, you really should get one according to your skin type. - Thank you, Nick. - [Voiceover] Great. - I'll live with that, yeah. - [Voiceover] Well, JD, you can explain. So, oh. - I get why you're hardcore. You're doing it every night, I used to do it. (mixed chatter) - [Voiceover] It's the third floor. - I pledged my freshman year, and it was among the best decision that I have made since being at Stanford. I very much enjoyed the fraternity, and suppose I'm here to represent the pro fraternity, pro house fraternity viewpoint. - There's a strong sexism that comes out in the all male living arrangement, having no women, having a lot of alcohol, and a lot of social functions, it's real, it's just a bad combination in terms of what it develops in people. It takes a very strong person to go through three years of a house fraternity system and not change in a significant way. In what I would say, in a real sort of deterioration of what you can become during college. (upbeat music) - I know what I want. We're about to be judged upon how we look and how we act within half an hour by a bunch of people. And like, even though it's not a true picture of yourself, you're still like, opening yourself to be rejected in some way. - You know, it's awful, I'm just like, turning to a stress case watching you all. - [Voiceover] No, I... - No, I feel, no, I feel like I'm watching my children, like, be thrown to the wolves or something. (cheering) - [Sorority] Go team, go, go! Go, team, go, go! (mixed chatter) - [Sorority] Pi Phi, you can't go wrong! Pi Phi house! Pi Phi house! Pi Phi house! - You ladies are Pi Phis, they'll like, drag you, like, around a home. - At least they talk about boobs all the time. Well, that's probably 'cause Debbie talked about boobs the whole time. - No, she said, she was like, dancing, like, oh yeah, like, remember me, like, her name tag, and they were like, oh, yeah, I 'll remember you. - No, yeah, Pi Phi was the first one we went to, and they talk to you, and they're like, just enough time, and then all of a sudden, it's, oh, I gotta introduce you to someone else. - You're so stupid. (mixed chatter) I got to go read. - It's a middle class... Middle class white thing. Yeah, if they invite me to stuff, you know, I wanna go, and, you know, I'll, you know, I will definitely let them patronize me 'cause they will. Yeah, they will, I mean, they will, yeah, especially the ones that don't have black members, they will kiss my backside. And I'll let 'em do it. (upbeat music) - It seems to be like it's gonna be a safe place, a place you can go back to. - Are you buzzed? - [Voiceover] The all guy thing, 'cause I really like that, you know? - That's interesting because everybody has to like, describe their masturbation to me. It's either, you know, it's either given to you by like, a friend in school, or you're just kinda playing around one day, and just boom, you know, you're like, wow, yeah. - See, my high school, you didn't even talk about it. And if anyone ever asked, no, I never do it, no matter what, huh uh. But see now that we're in college, we can sit around and talk about it. - [Voiceover] We can be a lot more mature, right? - Three or four times a week. - That's the thing about life. - A good week, you know? - In high school, yeah, you're just, everybody's like, no, I don't do it, all of a sudden, everybody comes out of the closet in college, I mean, like, two dudes in our house, like, claim they've never done it. (laughing) - [Voiceover] Oh, no. - [Voiceover] Let's go guys! Party night. (mixed chatter) - Oh, you're so cute, I love you right now. - Congratulations! (cheering) (hollering) - I'm so happy for them. What the hell was that about? - I want you in the house. - Yeah. - And I hope you'll take our bed. - Okay. - Now, Adam was, couldn't be there, but definitely made a point to tell me to push for you, so, of course, I'm pushing myself. - Well. - You know, after the A's game, I said, Sam, Sam, tonight? - Yeah. - Awesome. - I'll be up there tonight. - Great, thanks a lot, Sam. - Okay, thank you. - Of course. - [Voiceover] Really? - A lot of them didn't go to the events. A lot of the, half the events that I went to, and they still got in. And so, it's simply because I didn't look nice and neat on a resume. But... It's just really stupid. - It just wouldn't be that fun to be part of it without him being part of it. It would just be a pain in the ass. So, I just see it as it's basically... It's not accepting one of us or the other, it's just accepting both of us or not both of us. That's all there is to it. - [Voiceover] You gonna do it? - I think so. - [Voiceover] So, why were you angsting so much about it? Or, why'd you get all that advice? - What, why? 'Cause basically, Dan, and, you know this, and everybody knows this, everybody watching this will know this, that I care far too much about what other people think of me, you know? It's just basic insecurity. I mean, gettin' accepted at a place anywhere, it doesn't matter, it feels really good, you know, I mean, and you know. (alternative music) First time in my life I'm a player. A player in the social scene. I wasn't a player in high school. I just sat around and watched, and it was terrible, it was a nightmare. (mixed chatter) - See ya, guys. - Your ID numbers, all right, your ID number please? Social security, one, five, six, seven, six, seven, seven. That's pretty much a very controlled society. Nine to five, and then you come home, and you're tired, watch a little TV, go to dinner, spend a little bit of time with your wife and kids, and go home, and sleep. Controlling mechanism before it begins. Nothing's wrong with controlling mechanisms in a societal way, otherwise, you'd have anarchy, you'd have chaos. But at the same time, and in fact, we are in this, you know, delusion of, we are free individuals. We are getting an education. We're gonna have a wonderful life. - I guess, you know, you're supposed to go to college, and everything, to explore yourself, and find out who you really are, but if this is who I really am, and the fact that who I really am is absolutely nothing because I'm not really anyone, I'm just a product of the controlling mechanisms around me, then that sucks for me. 'Cause during my life, I'll never be who I wanna be. But I don't know who I wanna be because I don't know who I am besides the fact that I am the product of this controlling mechanism. (upbeat music) (mixed chatter) - I'm failing for what I said in the evaluation. - [Voiceover] What did you say in the evaluation? - Well, I said, you were right about how Aristotle is a sexist pig, but we didn't read metaphysics, or we didn't read ethics, we read about male feminism, but we didn't read on liberty. We read Hobbes, Locke, and Russo, what they thought about slavery, but we didn't read about, we didn't really like, concentrate on the social, the social contract. And we read about aborigines who thought you could get pregnant by eating a yam, but we didn't read about existentialism. That's what I wrote. So. - You know what I was realizing? I don't take academics seriously. You know? - [Voiceover] You just realize that now? - Yeah. I mean, you know how everyone jokes, well, I never study, I mean, I study, I just don't care what happens after I study. - You pretend you know everything, Monique, but you don't recognize it's controlling mechanism. You seriously fucking don't. That's a good thing. Don't feel bad for it because you're gonna go through all these years, and then say that you're gonna do whatever the fuck you want, and then as soon as you leave this place, you're gonna realize that it's there, and it's controlling you, and it's controlling you from the outside, it's controlling you from the inside, and that's when you're gonna be screwed. - Yeah. (mixed chatter) - [Voiceover] Deb, are you a sophomore now? - Am I sophomore now? I guess so. Oh, my God. - Oh, my God, I'm so happy. I'm on summer break, I love Russian lit. - [Voiceover] Where'd you get that tape? - Maybe you should talk to your parents about this. - Talk to them about what? - I don't know. Tell them that you feel like you're controlling. - I kinda did, listen, I, did I tell you this already? I called my dad the other day, yeah, I called my dad the other day, and he was like, yeah, well, you know, you're gettin' to the end of the year. (mumbling) No, he was like, yeah, gettin' into the end of your freshman year, how'd it feel? And I'm like, well, and I guess he was expecting me to say oh, it's wonderful, it's great, and I'm like, yeah, well, you know, it kinda sucked actually, I really don't think I liked it that much, you know? Emotionally and academically, I just wasn't ready for it, and I think that I'd have done a lot better if I had taken a year off and explored myself, and all this other stuff. And you know, I mean, I'm just not satisfied with my grades, and I'm not satisfied with anything that's happened this year. My dad was like, oh, so, all in all, it was a pretty good year. Yup! That's right, dad. (upbeat music) - [Voiceover] Shit. I think I learned a lot. I used to be pretty cynical about it, but I don't think I am anymore. I was, I kinda thought I knew everything before I came here, or pretty much anything that I needed to know, but once you're here, you realize, like, how much you don't know. - [Voiceover] I don't know, I guess I sort of expected that I would like, would not change at all from high school. You know? And I ended up becoming really good friends with who I never thought I would. - [Voiceover] Personally, I don't know if I've changed a lot, but I've become more, like, firm in who I am. More secure about that. (mumbling) - [Voiceover] Did I tell you I didn't come with many expectations? - I mean, this is really fucking pitiful the more I think about it. It sucks! The only truth I've found this year is not, well, I guess it's about myself, it's, I am limited by everything. You're limited by yourself. - [Voiceover] It's easy in coming to a place full of more experienced people. Some of them intimidatingly accomplished. - I'll see you guys next year. - [Voiceover] All right. - [Voiceover] To suppose that your own ideas are inferior to the ones they are urging upon you. Please don't fall willingly into that trap. Your interest and support are worth something to many people with many different agendas. - Oh, my God. - All right, hug. - [Voiceover] So, approach your classmates with respect, with sensitivity, with high expectations, and treat them as though you are already caring for a friendship that is as strong as family. - Get outta here, go! - [Voiceover] I don't know. I had all these hopes about this college thing. Didn't pan out. - [Voiceover] You still have to have 'em, Brandi. - [Voiceover] You still have three years left, sheesh Mah-Neesh.
