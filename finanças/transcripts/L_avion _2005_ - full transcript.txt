Everything should be fine. If you have a problem call me. Even tomorrow, I don't mind. Thank you. Hey, Charly! Come see. Look. See? You can pet him. Look! That's it. Hey Mom, it's snowing! Good evening. I slaughtered it. It'll make you a nice meal. How kind of you! Enjoy. Merry Christmas. Thank you, Merry Christmas. Mommy! Yes? Will Dad be home when we get there? Hopefully. He said this afternoon. Do you think he remembered my bike? You asked him for a bike? Yeah. I even wrote it on the card. Charly, come give me a hand! Roll up your sleeves. We want presents! Why isn't Dad home yet? He just called. He'll be very late. You'll see him tomorrow morning. Daddy! Not sleeping? I waited up for you. Got my present? Get back to bed, I'll be right up! Move it! Don't you like it? Yeah. It's late, you need to sleep. We'll play with it tomorrow. You're mad at me for coming home too late. There was a bad storm, we couldn't take off. I wish I could've been here with you tonight. Sometimes we want things to happen one way, but they happen another way. There's nothing we can do. That's not it. Then what is it? You said I'd get a new bike for Christmas. You got an airplane. That's way better. Bikes are boring. Everyone's got a bike. But you can't do anything with an airplane. Are you kidding me? Look. Airplanes can take off... They can glide, they can... They can do tons of stuff, all the airplane stuff. You know what? It doesn't matter. I'll put it on the armoire. Whenever you want it, just ask me. I'll put it here, so when you look up before falling asleep, it'll be like looking at the sky. I'll talk to Mom about the bike. Maybe you'll get it for your birthday. Not mad at me anymore? You need to get some sleep. Sweet dreams. Goodnight, Dad. You're home. Charly was awake. I gave him his present, the airplane. Did he like it? He was disappointed. He expected a bike. I spent so much time on it. I had to hurry to finish it for tonight. You're the one who's disappointed. Wait'll you see it, it's beautiful. I wish I'd gotten an airplane like that when I was little. Aren't planes better than bikes? Do I get a present? On the piano. Wait for me! Wait for me! Dad! What are you doing? Go back down. Don't forget my birthday present. This is no place to discuss birthdays, it's dangerous. If you don't hurry, they'll sell out. We're not discussing that here! Get down now, before I get angry. Charly, don't worry. I haven't forgotten your bike. I don't want to wake you, you look so peaceful. I'll be back in a few days. I love you, Dad. Mercedes, my birthday's in six days. Quiet! I'm getting a new bike. Don't tell. Why not? You won't get it. Take out your notebooks. Look. Where'd you find it? It's gonna poop. A mouse! Get back in your seats! Get up! What's this? Who brought it? Mercedes. Don't bring any more animals to school. It's not my fault, it crawled into my bag! See you tomorrow. Bye. Come with me, Charly. Charly, you're going to have to be very brave. This morning, something bad happened. Your dad had an accident. He died. Grandpa? What is it, son? Can I do my homework now? He was a courageous, dedicated man. He chose to serve the nation, with all the sacrifices and obligations such a choice implies. Lieutenant Colonel Pierre Lassalle consciously embraced his choice, and that made him a noble man. He is buried with full military honors, having given his life while in service to his country. Hello, are you Pierre's wife? Yes. Xavier Montaigut, I worked with your husband. We shared an office. I thought you might want his things. Your house is beautiful. Thank you. Your husband was an excellent pilot and engineer, very inventive. Probably the best among us. He will be sorely missed. Is this your beach cabin? You know it? Pierre often spoke of it. Pierre was on the verge of an important breakthrough. We must finish what he started, but we're missing certain documents. Did he keep anything here? I don't know, he rarely talked about work. If you find anything that looks relevant, please call me. Of course. Mom, what's in the box? Dad's stuff from the lab. Why don't you open it? I'll open it later. Mom? Charly, don't worry. I haven't forgotten your bike. I don't want to wake you, you look so peaceful. I'll be back in a few days. I love you, Dad. Mom! Did you put the airplane back on the armoire? You know, Dad's airplane. Did you put it back? No, why? Could you come help me, please? Stop! That's a nice airplane. Where's Mercedes? Over there. Mercedes? What are you doing? What are you doing? It's a secret. I've got a secret too. What is it? I can't tell anyone. If I tell, will you tell? Yes. Promise? I promise. You first. No, you first. I bury my favorite thing in the dirt, then I make a wish. If it disappears, my wish comes true. Your turn. My airplane is alive. It flies. It flew on the armoire by itself. I don't believe you. Show me. Fly, airplane! Airplane, please fly. Why won't you move? I know you can fly. Airplane, do you hear me? Say something! Liar! You lied to find out my secret. You're a big fat liar, and liars always get punished. If you can't fly, give me a sign. Move your wings or say something. Airplane, do you hear me? Airplane, do you hear me? Mom, I don't want to go to school. Why, what's wrong? I don't want to. But you have to. Why? I'm going back to work, I can't stay with you. I could stay home by myself. All kids go to school, you've got no choice. I won't go without my airplane. Hello, Madam. How are you doing, Charly? You want to bring your airplane with you? Good idea, you can show it to your classmates. Is that yours, can I borrow it? Where'd you get it? My dad made it. Is your dad really dead? Show us the plane. Gimme it! Before we get started, let's welcome back Charly. Welcome back, Charly. And during recess, I want two of you to fill him in on what we've been doing. Any volunteers? You, Mercedes? No. How considerate of you. I'll do it myself. Charly, want to show your airplane to the class? Never mind. Get out your notebooks and copy what I write on the board. Charly, what's going on? Do you have something to say? Then sit down. Hey, what's going on? Sit down, now! You started it! How'd you do that? Stop it! He started it! No recess for you two! Come on, move! Show me. Move again, please. You're alive, I knew it! Shine your light once for yes, twice for no. Are you my friend? Are you my friend? Please fly, please fly... Go on, fly. Fly! Careful! There's something I want to tell Dad. What do you want to tell him? That my airplane can fly. Where is he now? What do you mean? Where's Dad now? Do you think he's in heaven? I don't know. When we die we go to heaven, right? Some people believe that. Other people believe other things. It depends. On what? It depends on their religion, their culture, lots of things. What do you think? I think he's wherever we want him to be. I'm going to work. Will you be a good boy for Marietta? Yes, Mom. This house must be haunted. Charly? Charly's on the roof, I don't know what to do, come quickly! Charly, can you hear me? Answer me! We're coming to get you! I'm so frightened he'll fall! Tell your dad we need a ladder. He's gonna fly his plane. Hurry! Don't move. Fly! Go on, fly! Fly! Charly, answer me now. Why were you on the roof? I wanted to fly with my airplane. That's impossible. It's a toy, it can't fly. But it does fly. Charly, stop it! This is crazy. You know you could've killed yourself? Promise me you'll never try it again. Charly, promise me! Look at me when I'm talking to you! I'm taking it away. Let go, Charly! Charly, stop it! You'll hurt yourself. Give it to me! Leave that key. Sit down, now! Mom! Mom, I'm tired. Can I go to bed now? Yes, of course. Good night, Mom. Good night, sweetheart. Hello? Xavier Montaigut? Yes, who's calling? Catherine, Pierre's wife. What a nice surprise! How are you? That was fast. I came as fast as I could. You're saying a toy did all this? Did Pierre make it? Yes. Where is it? In Charly's room. May I see it? Does your son have a remote control for it? No, nothing. I need to take it to the lab. I'll bring it back. Where's my airplane? Dad's colleague took it to the lab. Why? To study it. You have no right! You nearly jumped off the roof, it broke everything, it's dangerous! You have no right! It's Dad's airplane! Charly, he promised to bring it back. Charly, say something. Charly, is that you? Mercedes! Mercedes, it's me, Charly. Wake up. What are you doing? I need your bike. What for? Let me use it, it's important. Only if you tell me why. Is it something to do with your airplane? Ok, but I'm coming with you. Are we almost there? Keep going. I'm tired, your turn. Did you hear that? It's the dead. Really, you think so? At night, the dead come to the forest. Come on, let's go. This is it, look. How will you get inside? I don't know. Look out! You hide, I've got an idea. Hide! Help me, help me! Somebody help me! Help me, help me! Somebody help me! What's going on? Help me, Mister. It hurts, I can't move. I think I broke something. What is it? There's nothing wrong with you. Get up. I can't, it's broken. What are you doing here? I went for a ride and I got lost. Get up, we'll call your parents. I can't get up, I swear. Your cell phone rang. Thanks. Wait, take a look at this. Could this airplane fly? It has no engine. It might glide, but it couldn't fly. Exactly. Pierre's wife says it flew through her house. She's imagining things. Let me show you something else. Not a dent, not a scratch. I've never seen anything so solid. Was it made here? No idea. And what's it made of? I don't recognize this matter. Lock it up and alert the hierarchy first thing in the morning. See you tomorrow. Get some rest. You tried to reach me? Charly's gone. I've looked everywhere. He may come to the lab. What makes you think so? He opened Pierre's box. The building is heavily guarded. I'll check outside. Wait there, don't go anywhere. They keep me locked in the basement with the dogs. I can't go back. They're not my real parents. Charly, can you hear me? Answer me! There he is! Look out! Run, run! There's guards everywhere, run! Stop! Charly, be careful. We just want to study it. Fly, fly! Fly... I'm begging you. Look at that! Xavier Montaigut, leave a message. Leave me alone! Let me go! Leave me alone! I'm calling the police! You're hurting me! Let her go! You know her? We're neighbors, what did she do? Take her home before I strangle her! Where's Charly? Tell me where he is! I don't know. What do you know about that airplane? Nothing! Where's Charly? Pierre must have said something! It's important! Where's Charly? He flew off the roof! Mercedes, is that you? You gotta help me. You gotta help me find my Dad. Don't be scared. Don't be scared, I'm here with you. After we find Dad, we'll leave the forest. This device is not very accurate. We'll split up. If you get lost, call me. Watch out for wild boars. Wait in the car. I want to stay with you. What's the matter? I'm afraid of wild boars. Dad? Dad? Charly? Is that you? Did you hear that? It must be the wild boar. Over there! Xavier, can you hear me? What happened? I must have passed out. Looking for this? There's nothing more we can do. We'll tell the police where to look. Go home, in case your son comes back on his own. I'll take you. Where are we going? I'm taking you home. I want to wait for Charly with you. Ok, I'll call your parents back. You can do it. We'll fly again, from up there. Meteorite found in the Egyptian desert. Extraordinary potential to make a light, highly resistant airplane. What are you doing? Where are you going? Please stay... Please stay... Stay with me. Go home and don't say a word. Where are you going? I can't say. I want to come. I'm sorry, you can't. You must go home. Get going! Hello Ma'am, can we help you? I'll be right back. Did she say where she was going? No, but she was acting strange, looking up at the sky. Is anyone here? Is anyone here? Charly, it's me. Can you hear me? Charly, can you hear me? Where did you find him? Up there. What's wrong with him? Maybe sunstroke. He needs a doctor. Where's the airplane? Charly, can you hear me? Try to move. Mom? What is it? I lost my airplane. Go back to sleep. Look out! Be careful! Don't touch it! Don't touch it! Catherine, don't touch it! Stop! Stop! Stop, I said! Stop right now! Where are we? Taking a trip together. Go back to sleep, we've got a long drive. Mom? Yes? Where are we going? To the seaside. Why aren't we going home? The people from the lab are looking for us. They want to study your airplane. They've never seen one like it. That's because it's magic. Mom? Do you think we'll find my airplane? I don't know. Last night I flew off the roof of the lab. I flew over the trees. I saw houses and roadsand the forest from up there. Do you believe me? Yes. What are you doing here? Come on! Get out of there! Wait for me here. Wake up, honey. We've arrived. Look who's here. I'm sleeping here! No, me! No, me! Me! I am! That's enough now. Go play. Mom! Look, I found it in the sand! Fly... Your plane can't fly anymore? Thanks. Here. Finish up, it's time for bed. We all need some rest. Goodnight. Sweet dreams. Goodnight. Mom? My airplane is broken. Are you sure? Yeah, I tried everything. I even talked to it. It's broken. You can try again tomorrow. Get some sleep now. But if my airplane's broken, I'll never find Dad. And if I don't find Dad, I can't tell him what I wanted to tell him. If you want to talk to him, you can. He may not answer, but I'm sure he'll hear you. Go to sleep. Charly, go bury your airplane. Charly... Look at me. Be with your mom. She needs you. She needs you to be big and strong. Go back to her. Tell her I'm thinking of her. Tell her I love her. You know Charly, even though you can't see me anymore, I'll always be with you. Even when you're a grown man. All your life. Look up at the sky and you'll know I'm thinking of you. Give me a smile. I want to see your smile before I go. Dad? I wanted to tell you I was happy when you gave me the airplane. Goodbye, Dad. Mom? I want to go home. Really? What'll we do with your airplane? I don't want it anymore, I'm leaving it here. Are you sure? Yes. Where's the finish line? The trunk! Mom? Last night, I saw Dad. He told me to tell you he loves you.
