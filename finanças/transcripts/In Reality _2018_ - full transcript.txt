I'm... making a film... about me... and my feelings for you. I'm still not over you. And I wanna figure out why that is, and how it got to this point. But it's gonna be fun. I'm Ann Lupo. I am a... filmmaker. What do you hope to find with us? I hope to find... that I can change. Yeah. This was me three years ago. I was 23 years old... and most of the time, I was lost in... one of many fantasies. And almost all of them were about falling in love. There's this... narrative, or maybe truth... it doesn't, I don't know, to be in love with someone, and for them to be in love with you is one of the holiest experiences you can have on this Earth. ♪ I'm so happy That you found me ♪ ♪ And with your arms around me ♪ ♪ It's a happy wonderful world ♪ The movies that have written people's mental paradigms about love. They are heightened. And then if you believe that it's something that you should be a part of, because it seems like a really fun thing. I was just looking to not be single anymore. I wanted to have someone to do all the things that people in couples do with. But it didn't really matter who that person was. I could practically fall in love with anyone. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. So, yeah, I was pretty confused about how love works. But you know, there's a lot of misinformation out there. Umm... So, I worked for this incredible couple. They run a business together, making videos and commercials, and... Now, they're engaged! Oh, my god! Congratulations. I can't believe it. My little sister's engaged. Hey, Ann. Dude. Yes. Incredible man. Aww. Was it incredible? Yes, Rachel. Oh, okay. Right. How did you, uh, pop the question? Oh, my god. So, listen to this. I spent three months. He created a scavenger hunt around the entire city. What? Around all the places we've been to when we were in a relationship, and he set up videos and little riddles for me to solve. Guess it was perfect? Right? Yes, yes, yes. The birds... ...they were just like, right on cue. Wow. Just like... It was just so special. The trees were swaying like... ...background dancers. Yeah. It was beautiful. And then, there was like a... And then, and then, and then... Can you film us? And then, at the end of that whole thing, I was waiting for her outside of 126 St. Mark's Place, where we first met. Aww. And I got down on one knee... I wanna do it. Adrienne. Mm-hmm? Will you marry me? And she said, "Yes." Aww, this is great. Love becomes marriage. Oh, okay. Marriage becomes vows. Vows last... a lifetime. Tears... forever... is... now. He expressed it. Whoo. Wow. Hey, that was awesome. That was really good. Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm so proud of you guys. Congratulations, you two. Congratulations. Have a good day writing poetry, dude. Are you serious? My videos get way more views than yours. I think we should take the day off. Oh, but we have about... that deck with the presentation that's due on Friday. That deck. Are you telling me we can't work on that deck... from bed? Oh. Mm. Oh, you know I can work on that deck from anywhere in the apartment. Oh, sorry. I can hear you. Oh, Ann. Um, you can hold down the fort here, right? Yeah. Oh, god, what? It's nothing. It's nothing. Seriously... What am I forgetting? We were... we were going to... Have our meeting today. Yes, but... About the script. It's fine. Okay, I read it last night and it's actually pretty bad, so I don't... I don't wanna share with you. So no worries. Ann. Ann, Ann, Ann. We don't have to do the meeting. I seriously wanna read your script. And I will stay here and I will do that today... because that's the kind of boss I am. Thank you so much, but seriously, go. Have fun. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Go. Okay. Hey, why don't you use the studio for yourself today? Okay. Use all the equipment. Use whatever you want. Maybe I will. Bring your friends. Yeah, and tomorrow, I promise, we will resume professional work but... ...you know. Oh, download this card Okay, bye. When you get a chance, please. Thanks. Bye. Okay. It's What's the Problem? With your host, Andy Pincers! Thank you for joining us. I'm Andy Pincers. And welcome back yet again to What's the Problem? Where we shame young women who are not living up to their full potential. Let's say hello to our contestants today. Ann Lupo! So, Ann, you've been on the show quite a few times now. Is that right? Yeah, um, practically every day. So you know the drill. You want a relationship that is the most epic, cosmic, white sizzling hot, bodice-ripping, intellectually explosive, emotionally supportive, yadda yadda yadda, love affair of our time. Is that right? Uh-huh. But there's just this one thing though. This guy. I don't see him. He's not here so... what's the problem? Well, I think if I... Oh, Ann, I'm sorry. That is incorrect. But I'll tell you what the problem is. The problem is that enormous nose. Those awkward chest hairs. And that, coarse Sicilian mustache. Ooh, brutas! And on the other hand, folks, help me out here. You're lazy! You're lazy! And you're probably not even talented. Probably not even talented! Oh. I am just getting word that Ann believes that if she can acquire all of these things, only then will she be truly happy. Happiness. She wants to be happy! Which leads us to our final round! The Underlying Problem! Now, Ann... do you believe that you... deserve all of this? That's correct! And that's your problem! Now get back to work. Hello? Where are you? Yeah, I'm... getting on the subway as we speak. There was like a crazy delay and I have to get out at the other subway. Welcome to Wife Night. Okay, now, I will shout it from the rooftops that I love my IUD! Yeah, I got the one that goes into your arm and I like... I like never get my period. You never get it ever? Oh. Never. I started this book on past-life regressions. It's super far out but I love it. Is she speaking in tongues? There are voices that speak through her about, like, energy fields and higher dimensions. This is Lallie. We've been best friends since we were born. Have you thought about what you want for your birthday? No. Would you like me to get you an IUD? No. Would you like me to get you... a Yoni Egg made of pure diamond. Yeah. Maybe Scott would like that. Scott? Like Scott "Scott"? Like, two months ago Scott? Yeah. Are you guys still hooking up? No. No, no, no. Are you... Yes, but no. Dating? No, no. We're just... enjoying each other's company. But I'm still your primary partner, right? In all my past lives and all the lives I have yet to live. I will never love anyone more than you. Even if I come back as a turtle? I will bejewel your shell. Thank you. Ann you're up. Okay. Oh. The Nine of Swords. I know that card. That some sexy, sword-wielding man about to storm into your life and bang the shit out of you. Cool. Like Braveheart sex. Can I haveEnglish Patient sex? Silence! Oh. This is a really serious card. You are going to go through a total, spiritual upheaval, and you are gonna be completely blindsided by the consequences of your actions. Total obsession will drive you to madness! Okay. Or... could also be the sexy, sword-wielding man. No phones during a tarot reading. Oh. "Ms. Lupo, can I see you tonight? I'm still hard from last time." It doesn't say that. Might as well. Uh, is that who I think it is? When did that happen? We got back in touch. As in? We got back in... touch. Isn't he mean to you? No, he's hot. And I'm horny. Let me live. Ann, have fun. Be safe. Go fuck your brains out. Thank you. And maybe it's not just sex this time you know. We keep coming back to each other and I think, there is something there. Okay. I know what I'm doing. When we start dating, it'll be purely for sexual and intellectual fulfillment, and be totally unexclusive. Like if you wanna sleep with anyone else or I wanna sleep with anybody else. That's fine. No, no, no. Back this up. I don't wanna sleep with anyone else. Yes, you do. I just sort of subscribe to this theory that I can really have whatever I want. Without any consequence, you know. Uh... So I kind of started, like, dating, like not even, not dating, just hooking up with people. Ah! And that was like the normal thing to do as a young person. Yeah, just playing the parts of people having sex that don't actually care about each other. Finally, it was like, "Oh, my god. Seriously, stop." Take a couple of months. Don't think about boys. No, you are not allowed anymore. You need a time out. And maybe that will cure you of whatever this is. Um... And that's when it dawned on me. I am a strong, independent, career-orientated woman, and the very, very last thing I need is a fucking boyfriend. So, I had sworn off men. ♪ Get out my way ♪ ♪ Just keep this shirt 'Less you got something to say ♪ There was always that pressure, especially from Aunt Doreen. Are you seeing anyone special? Did my mom put you up to this? We're just trying to help, okay? Have you tried any of the apps? No. Not my thing. What about joining a gym? I'm definitely not meeting someone at the gym. Grad school? Oh. Would you do church? No, okay. I don't even wanna be in a relationship right now. You don't have one of those "fuck buddies", do you? No. What? It's fine, okay? I don't need to be tied down or committed to just one person because there's so much of the world left to explore. And I'm really busy. That is such a bunch of bullshit. Okay. If you must know... what I really want is to be in love. And to meet this person in the most cosmic, fantastic way as if it were destiny. And I'm gonna love him, and he is going to love me. And it's gonna be... perfect. Oh, Annie. No, Annie. Annie, no! What? What? I have to tell you that man does not exist. And if you keep waiting around for him, you're going to end up alone! And believe me, you do not want to be alone at my age. I've seen things. Terrible things. These thoughts become habits. And the habits become your life. Annie, look at Jason. He thought he would find someone by just waiting around. But he waited too long. And now he's 30. I mean, what are you even doing here? We were gonna have lunch. No, Annie, honey. You have got to get out there! Oh, right now? Yup, yup, yup. I'm... Let's go. I'm hungry. Have... Have you met John? No, who's John? My friend Carol's son John. Have I introduced you to him? No, I don't... Oh, honey, you have to meet him. I mean, you two have so much in common like so much. I can't... I can't believe I didn't think of this before. Oh, okay. He is a sweet boy. I mean, a genuinely good person. And his father's a playwright. Okay? I will... I will e-mail introduce you tonight. Okay, but can you not make it a date thing, because I'm really not trying to think about boys right now. So she set us up. I thought that if I didn't dress up, and I had a reason to leave shortly after he arrived, he would understand that I was not interested in him. I was not trying to impress him. And I could meet a guy without it having romantic connotations. And we could just be friends. Oh, fuck. Sorry I was late. Uh, were you waiting long? Oh, no. I was in the neighborhood. What were you, uh, writing? Nothing. I sat across from him and I was like, "Whoa, I have the potential to be... incredibly attracted to you, but I am not gonna do that." I like the shirt. It's very like... Marcel Marceau. Oh. Thank you. Yeah. That's exactly what I was going for. I like yours, um... It's very Steve from Blue's Clues. Wow. I was just watching the first season. Oh, great. That's great. Can I get you something to drink? Yeah. Uh, what are you having? I could see that we just got each other, and we could just go speeding along in the conversation. What were you doing? I was in Tibet. Wow. Yeah. What... What's in Tibet? There's many things, a lot of yaks. Tell me about your trip. Oh, it was... No. It was really boring. I was just doing, like, soul search. Straight up. Um... Wow. Did you straight up find this soul? Cheers. The soul was sought. Soul was not found. No. Oh, no, but it's okay. We made progress. Okay. You kind of know where it might be? No. Maybe I should try Tibet. You should try Tibet, exactly. I may have seen your soul there. He seems really nice. And awkward and weird. And I liked that. The reoccurring joke of the night was that we were the same person. Finishing each other's sentences. "Oh, my god. Do you think that way too?" I see time like we're all on this track-and-field track. So we're like here-ish. Yeah. Right now. Thank you. Yeah, we're here. Yeah, yeah. Here, right? Here. This is it... There. I'm with you. I'm on this track with you. Cool. Yes. Cheers. Sorry about that. Oh, it's okay. Oh, shit. Did you say you had to be somewhere at 8:00? Yeah, what time is it? It's like 7:57. Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. I have to go. Oh, no, no, no. I got it. Oh, no. No, it's, uh... It's, uh... It's okay. It was really great to meet you. Yeah. Great to meet you. See you. Bye. I left the bar that night thinking, "Wow. What an amazing person." I... probably won't see him ever again. Like an hour later, I had an e-mail from him. "Hey, it was so nice to meet you." Like blah-blah. Things that you say. And I was like, "Okay." If you wanna see someone again, you send that e-mail. Right? Do you have something that you would like to share with the class? No. Spit it out. Scott called me his girlfriend the other day. What? Are you in love? I... think so. Oh, my god. What does it feel like? Um... a warm pair of wooly socks. I don't know. Like, uh... carbonated brain. Like, uh... clear gust of mountain air. Like, uh... ...cocoon of comfort. Like the peace of the calm seas. I'm so happy for you. Yeah. Oh, and also, I got confirmation that my piece will be featured in a prestigious dance showcase. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! That's incredible. Oh, my goodness. Yes, so that's... Is that it? That's everything? Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for sharing. Yeah. That's all. So, you know that guy my aunt set me up with the other day? Yes. Methinks he might be a sweet boy. A sweet boy. The rarity of a sweet boy. Mm-hm. We'll see, though. We'll see. "We'll see"? Mm-hm. Where that means you like him, you like him! So the second time we hung out was a week later. He invited me to his friend's house party. And the whole time, I was making sure that my behavior was in no way flirtatious, so that it would all have to come from him. Hello. Can I help you? What does it mean? Oui? Oui. Mmm. Time to go home now. That's... ...the responsible thing to do. I think I'm gonna go home, actually. I have to be up early. Oh, yeah, totally. Me too. Where are you headed? Uh, Bushwick. Me too. I'll go with you. So, we leave together. I hadn't dressed for the cold, but he had a jacket, so he gave it to me, and like, zipped it up. He's like, so nice. Um... and then we got on the subway. A pretty empty car, rocking back and forth. His face was right here, and it was getting really close to mine, and we were like looking into each other's eyes. Is this abnormal? And then, he's like, "Oh, I'll walk you home." As we were rounding the corner, talking to myself, "What do you do when you get to the door?" It was like you can't... kiss him. No way. You have to just hug him. So, we got to the door. "This was so much fun. Thanks for walking me home." He just grabbed me and kissed me. ♪ I'm a fool ♪ It... lasted a while before I responded to it. Holy shit, this is happening. You like me. Yes! Party in my brain. And then, um... ♪ I wanna make this play ♪ ♪ Oh, I know you're fading ♪ ♪ Mmm, but stay ♪ And then, I was like... do you wanna come upstairs? ♪ I wanna make this play ♪ ♪ Oh, I know you're fading ♪ So, he came upstairs, we started hooking up, but, it was... fun. He was cracking jokes. Whoa, okay. New animal to figure out here. I suggested that we have sex. So, we did. How was it? It was good. ♪ Ooh, stay over ♪ What if I... felt like that? But... to him, this was... just like any other sex he's ever had. And so, maybe... to him, I was just like a girl that he slept with. But at that moment, there was not a doubt in my mind that we were starting a relationship. Oh, my god. He just texted me. What'd he say? "Hey, Loops. How are you? What are you up to this weekend?" Hmm, "Loops." What should I say? You should say, "I want you to go down on me for the rest of the afternoon." I got it. "Hey. Me and my friend are hanging out today, but I'm free for the rest of the weekend." That's so boring. And it should be "My friend and I." Fuck. I already sent it. I think I know what I wanna do for my birthday. Oh, yeah? I was thinking, since it's my last year of my mid-20s, thought we could do like a roaring 20s party. Yes! That's a brilliant idea. I'm brilliant. Can I invite John? As long as he has a costume. He's texting me. Thank you. Hey, asshole! Ow! Welcome to her Infinite Variety Show! While working in my lab like, late... While working in my lab late one night, I accidentally became a prima ballerina. The other day, I saw a man I liked, and I went right up to him I did so, and I said, "I like you. I really like you." But he did not take so kindly to my advances. Oh, my god. I'm sorry to disturb you. I love that voice. Thank you. Keep up the good work. Thanks. Okay. Good day. Jesus! Hey! He is texting me. God! What the fuck? I need to be in an old city, with ruins, and great poets, and witches, you know? Uh-huh. It's mainly mergers, distress acquisitions. We may be a small company, but, my guys are sharks. I bet. Excuse me. Oh, my god. Is it too much? No, it's perfect. Hello. Welcome. Lallie, this is John. Wow, Lallie. I've never heard that name before. Well, it's really Lauren... ...but don't call me that. Okay, nice to meet you, Lallie. Happy birthday. Oh, why thank you. Thank you. Scott, this is John. Hey, man. Really nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Hey, are you guys ready to dance? Oh, yes. Yes. Hey, everybody, everybody! Let's Charleston. Hmm, he s' mores with precision. I'm actually very good at making s'mores, because when my parents got divorced, my dad didn't know what else to do with us, so he took us on all these camping trips, to like, teach us how to be men or something. Hmm. So... ...great times. Impressive work. Yeah. In the same year, I went through puberty, my parents got divorced, and 9/11 happened. Oh... So... That is rough. It's fine. Hmm. When my parents got divorced, it was like... Try it in a haiku. Ooh, amazing idea. Okay. There was an affair. Same. Really? Yeah. Oh, my god. Hashtag same person. Finish the poem. Oh, okay. Um... I played a lot of internet Scrabble. Oh, no! That is so sad. Yeah, I did like a... That is... Scrabble chat room that I would do, instead of homework. No. But yeah, it hit the spot. I bet it did. Okay. Um... That's too many syllables. Okay. There was an affair. Internet Scrabble saved me. Oh, no. Everyone's fine now. Mazel tov. You guys want this? Yes. I constantly think about... ...how to avoid fucking up my future children. Me, too. Right? I'm like, we're living on a farm reading by candlelight together as a family. Yes, a family. Yes. No electronics. No. Farm animals only. Yes. Farm animals. Imagivision presents, Future Memories! Here you are on your first trip around the world. It's adventurous. It's exciting. You fight. You make love. It's everything you've ever wanted. And here you are on your wedding day. Converting to Judaism was a no-brainer. You may kiss the bride. You are very happy with your decision. L'Chaim! And here you are, accepting your first joint Academy Award. Remember to thank the Academy. Over here! My, how they sparkle on the mantlepiece. And here you are with your children. Would you believe it? Twins, a boy and a girl. Coochie coochie coo! And the grandchildren. Thank God they have his nose. Ah, yes. It's a truly magnificent life you've manifested for yourselves. Oh, and here you are, walking off into the sunset. Still crazy after all these years. Future Memories! Jumped on it, and it just cracked completely through. It was really funny. Hey, so, we haven't really talked. About what? About us. We've been hanging out a lot, and... things got weird, and stuff happened. I think you're so rad. We get along really well, so... I wanna keep hanging out as friends. Oh. Yeah, I just wanted to tell you now before... 'Cause I never wanna lead anyone on or anything. Yeah, I just kind of felt like going in this... direction and I wanted to... ...stop it before things got weird. I'm sorry to leave you like this, but I have to run to this appointment in the city. Oh, yeah. That's fine. Um... Sorry, just to clarify, you just wanna be friends? Yes. Yeah, we can be friends. Cool, okay. Yeah. Cool. Uh... Bye. Bye. I said to myself, I can't be his friend, just given how strongly I feel for him. If someone was giving me advice right now, they would say, "Don't be friends with this person, 'cause it's gonna ultimately hurt you a lot." Yeah. I can do that. That's easy. It was the only thing on my mind, ever... 'cause I couldn't figure out what happened, so I just kept replaying it over and over, just thinking about what I should have done, what I should have said. I'm sorry to leave you like this, but I have to run to this appointment in the city. So, sorry, just to clarify, you just wanna be friends? Yes. Actually, I don't think I could be friends with you. Oh. Yeah, I think it's best if we don't see each other anymore. Okay. Damn, that's a... a bummer. Yeah, it fucking sucks. You think I wanna cut you out of my life like a crazy person? No? No, of course not. But I definitely can't be friends with you because I'm fucking in love with you. And you did lead me on. You kissed me. You had sex with me. You always text me, and now you wanna be friends? Um, yeah. Ann, Ann. Ooh. Jumpy today. Sorry. What's up? Okay. Umm, I'm not mad, but... Oh, god. What you sent out last night had a lot of mistakes. I'm sorry. I'll fix it. It's okay, I'm not mad, but on top of the mistakes, it was... just really uninspired. You know, like, where's the... Where are you? I'm sorry, I think I'm just really tired. Can I get you some Adderall? Miguel. I'm just kidding. I'm fine, thank you. I'll just... I'm gonna fix it tonight. You know the drill, right? Yeah. Serve up that special sauce, you know. Fuck it up. Make it weird. Make them question everything. Yeah, okay. Sauce. Fucked up. Weird. Weird questions, all right? Got it. That's what I like to hear. Got it. Okay. All right. I will see you on the flip side, Ann, and... Hmm? I'll see you at home, okay? All right. Good luck. Call you right after. Okay. Hi. Hi. What's the matter? It's really stupid. I don't even wanna tell you. What's up? There's this guy... Oh, okay. So, I started talking about it, and she was like, "That's... exactly what happened..." With me and Miguel. What? Yeah. Well... So, it was 2005, I just moved to the city from this small town in Northern California. I was 22 and I didn't know anyone in New York. So, I'm fresh off this bus, waiting in the rain, when this random dude, and of course, he totally forgot I was coming. And so, I met Miguel because I moved into his apartment. And I remember when I met him, I thought he was really handsome. He looked like a leading man. All right, well, welcome to New York. Oh. And this is basically like a one-bedroom apartment in the East Village, that was turned into a two-bedroom, and three dudes had been living there before I moved in, so there was shit all over the place. It was a mess, but it didn't matter. Until I decided... How do you like it? Yes. I definitely need to live here. We just, sort of became buddies, or partners, operating in this little team. We just did everything together. We'd troll the East Village every night. Drank and played pool. That's what we did. We would wait up for each other late at night. If the other had to work, meet back up at two in the morning, and talk for a little while. I mean, we literally were comparing scars. After about maybe six months into knowing him, I thought, "This is very clearly what happens when two people like each other." There's a force field around us when we talk to each other. There's an electricity. So, I said something to him. "It seems like you like me. And I like you. And maybe we should..." Dot, dot, dot. I just don't, uh... I don't know what to say to that. I mean, that's really cool. And then, I was really embarrassed. I, I thought, "Oh, my god. I've completely misread this whole situation." And I normally don't do that. Like, I normally really trust my judgement. So, I backed away. And said like, "Okay. No problem." And immediately he was fine, and so I thought, "Well, if he's fine." Then I'm fine, then we went back to being friends. ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Where are you going? ♪ Audition. ♪ Where are you going? ♪ But it just felt like there was something amiss. Like, there's something not quite right. And, after about another six months, I said it again. "Not to be a weirdo nag, or anything, but, I kinda feel like... We spend every night together, and I think maybe we like each other." And it was the same thing again. He was like, "No. I don't... Not, not like that, but you are my best friend." We probably had this conversation about four or five times. The first time, I was embarrassed. The second time, I was like, "Really?" And then by third, I was like, "This is fucked up." This went on for three and a half years. So, I finally decided to just get myself out of this situation. Because at that point, it was detrimental to me. So I said, "I'm going to move out. And when I move out, I'm not gonna hang out with you anymore. You make me feel bad about myself. And it makes me feel like I'm an unlovable person." And he was like, "I can't bear to see you go." And I was like, "I can't bear to go, but, I must." And then I moved out. About three weeks later, he said, "Let's go get a drink." And I was like, "No, I don't wanna get a drink with you." And he said, "Please. Get a drink with me." "Okay, fine." So, we go to this bar on the Lower East Side. I'm just on edge the whole time like, prickly nervous. And then he tells me that he's in love with me. And he has been, for a while. I was so floored, because that's exactly what I wanted him to say, but I never thought he'd actually ever actually say it. So, my first reaction was... "You fucker! Why did you make me go through all that?" And we had this weird, lengthy, heated conversation that I can't remember at all, because I was in shock. I think we both kinda felt like, "This is it." And... We made it. Okay. This is the same situation. He loves me and he just doesn't know it, yet. We're just gonna keep hanging out and, uh, he'll figure it out. All right. Don't forget to lock up. Okay, bye. Bye. Fuck! Fuck. Oh, my god. Hey, where are you? Hi. I am so sorry. I, I just got completely sucked into something at work. It's fine. I'm so sorry. This is inexcusable. Um, how did it go? How did it go? It was great. Um, actually, I have to go. I'm just glad you're okay. Okay, well. I'm so sorry again. Bye. I'll talk to you soon. He loves me. He just doesn't know it, yet. Hey! Hey. How are you? Good, how are you? What did you do today? I just got back. I had to get out of this... Kind of a huge secret I've never told anyone before. Okay, so, whisper it. I wanna try doing stand-up. Are you kidding? I have been writing a bit in my head, for months. Wait, can we like, actually do this? Yes, okay. When are you free? Let's plan it out right now. I think the 30th. That is the perfect day. ...shoot. You go. Fuck! Okay. Um... No, can you go first? No, you got this. Can we just watch another stand-up special? No. Go! Okay. I still can't believe we did that. I know! It felt so good to feel, like, nervous again and scared. We are the coolest people I know. We are. Okay, so, what are we gonna do next? Hmm. I always wanted to do like, a modern, expressionist dance class. Wait, I just took one, last week. Weird. I wanna keep hanging out as friends. We never kissed again, we never hooked up again. And things started to get pretty fucked up in my head. What? Nothing. So, uh... John asked me to do a project with him, last night. Which I think is a really good sign because... But then it's like, "What does that mean?" Can I... And then there was this other moment, I'm sorry. Okay. There's this other moment last night, where his foot was touching my leg, and he was seal flipper-ing me. Like just his foot was just grazing my leg, and of course, I wasn't gonna make a move, and neither was he. 'Cause, I think he's scared of his own feelings, you know? Why do you still hang out with him? Because I like hanging out with him. Don't you think it's a little masochistic? No, I fully have accepted and understand that he doesn't want to be in a relationship right now. And that's fine, because we're friends. For now. Mm. And anyway, like you're always with Scott. So, it's like. Where is everyone? They said it was too far to come into Manhattan. Ha! So, Ann. What's up with you? I'm starting a project with John. He has this idea and, um, I thought it was cool, so I said yes. Wait. You're still hanging out with John? Thank you. Yeah. Ann. Baby girl. No, no, no. I don't think this is a good idea. Why not? Because you still like him. Yeah, but it's not like that, we're just... working on a project together. Ann. Ann. Think about it. Good evening, I'm Andy Pincers, and welcome back to What's The Problem? Tonight, we bring you some exclusive interviews with some very special guests. So, Lallie, tell us. What is Ann's problem? Andy, we've been over this. It's that she's repulsively naive. Repulsive. Penis? I don't believe you. No, seriously. I don't ever, truly, honestly never watched porn. I don't. Wait, so. Truly, honestly, how do you like? Um... I kind of just think about like, what it's like to be in love. Oh. Interesting. Goddamn it, Ann. Yeah. Um... Tiffany, what do you think the problem is? She pours out all of her power to fill him up. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Would you mind doing me a huge favor? Yeah, anything. What's up? It's irresponsible. Hm. Oh, hey. Actually I, um... I have to go let my roommate in. Oh. Um... Okay. Yeah, but I'll see you... Yeah, I'll be back. Yeah. Okay. Cool, see you. Bye. What do you think the problem is? She's completely, Mm-hmm. And totally, ANDY: Mm-hmm. Deluded. Mm. My brain had just stopped working. Okay. So, I only have access... ...I told you to do that everyday. I'm sorry, honey, but you're emotionally bankrupt. All you have to do is say, "If you don't want to be with me then it's your loss." You can do so much better. Yeah, you deserve someone who actually cares about you. You know what? Call him. Mm. No. Right now. Ann. Come on, go. Okay. Oh, my... Hiya, Loops. How's it going? Hey, how are you? I'm good, I'm good. I'm just packing up for that trip in the Galápagos. There's all these last minute thing to do, um... No. What's up with you? Um. Not too much. Okay. Okay. Um, awkward conversation approaching. Oh, great. I love those. You ready? Yup. Okay. Do you know that I still like you? Like, is that within your awareness? Uh-huh. Yeah, sometimes I am aware of it. We, we hang out so much, and sometimes the things that you say, and like the stuff that we do together, just makes me think... ...that you like me. And I'm just really confused, so... I wanted to talk to you about that. Well, I really like hanging out with you, and we have so much fun together. I just like being your friend, because you're so cool and you're so rad. Uh, not helping. Um... Okay, how about this? I need you to just say out loud, that you don't like me that way. Or else, I won't believe you. Do you want me to say that? Yeah. Okay, um... Ann, I don't... like you that way. I don't share the same feelings that you do. But I really like you as a friend. Okay. Okay. I don't that we should hang out any more. No, we don't have to do this. It'll be such a bummer. Yeah, you've said that before. Well, I mean it. Okay. Look, can we just talk Um, I have to go. About this, when I get back. Ann? Are you there? Okay. Ann? Bye. John. It's so great to have you on the show. Thank you so much again, for joining us. Thank you for having me. Cameras are off. Oh? Come on, you can tell me. What was the problem? Well, what it really came down to was... I just wasn't attracted to her. Bah! Now, that's a problem. Um, and then there was the nose, of course. Terrible, the worst. She was so clingy, she just wasn't someone I wanna start a relationship with. No, no, no. You don't need that. I just wish she would stop. Let me tell you. She's on my show every day, and I hate her. Mm. I know you got more. And then, uh... It just doesn't make any sense. I feel like he's just lying to himself. What? Ann. Wake up. It has been an entire year. And it never even came close to a relationship. And since, okay, no one else will tell you, you're being crazy, like actually out of your mind. Well, maybe if you weren't hanging out with Scott all the time, you'd have a better understanding of how much pain I'm in right now. Listen to yourself! I'm telling you that I'm having a hard time, and you're just abandoning me. There is more to life than stupid boys, and stupid love, Ann. Have you even read the news lately? I don't hang out with you because you suck to be around. You suck my energy. I'm just this pot, that you dump all your emotional shit into. And I'm sick of it!
