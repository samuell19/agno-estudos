Ripped by gdhaliwal23 Hello, friends. I am Monika, live from Living India News Channel. As you can see, we are in a beautiful village of Punjab. Like Southall in the UK is considered as the Mini Punjab, similarly, this village in Punjab is known as Mini America. It's because two thirds of the people from here are well settled with big mansions of Punjab... the clean roads, filled with imported goods and imported cars. This is what he gave me. -Guddi. -Yes. He said that whenever I wish to talk to him, I should "ping" him. Someone tell him that if I can't handle a phone properly, then how can I handle a computer? He wants me to "ping" him. I don't know what black magic she has done on my son. It has been five years. Neither he has come nor has he sent my grandsons. That witch has given such weird names to my grandsons. Cha Singh, Shoo Singh. What kind of names are those? We visited the entire village. Now let's talk to seniors sitting here. -Uncle? -Yes. I have toured the whole village. I didn't see a single young man. -Can I ask something? -Go ahead. Is there any young man left in this village? There is, dear. There is one young man. Yes. Mann's son. Major German Singh Mann. So he has a big post in the army! Oh. German, don't ruin it with the over practicing. Here's your file. It's time for the interview. I think you didn't hear it, daddy. Oh my! My son talks so well in English! Bless me! What's happening? Myself Major Ger... Uh... Not England, Major! What's this nonsense! This won't help you. It is so difficult to lie. My name is... -I am working... -Very good, Mr. Khan. Be confident. Don't be scared of anything. Talk with confidence. You are good in English. I understood. Talk in English. Stick to English. That's it. As you wish. Don't mess up. So what if you didn't get England's visa? We still aren't out of countries or money. We will try some other place. For now, only his visa application is being rejected. In a few years, his marriage proposals will also get rejected. He might end up with getting neither the meat nor the milk from the goat. Stop blabbering. Teja has gone to England when he was 26. He got married when he was 28. My son got late because he was studying. You need to have some change in the pocket to get the visa. You cannot make money without having some money of your own. Aunt, I am starving. Please serve me dinner. Sister-in-law, you shouldn't be so proud of your money. My son too will go abroad. Otherwise, change my name. Why are you getting upset, big brother? She has a habit of joking. I am not joking. I suggest that you find a nice place and get him married. I cannot cook for everyone every day. I want to get rid of them. Okay then! You just wait and watch, sister-in-law. I'll have the most beautiful daughter-in-law in the village. German, get up! -Let's go! -Brother! You didn't get the visa? But you were very good in English. Let me tell you the real reason. These Englishmen don't like us. It's not the fault of our English. I am very good in English. Damn you, Shahid Khan! You got my visa rejected! Well done, Major. You have hit the jackpot this time. An Indian girl as your visa officer. What's your name, dear? Hey, you are a Punjabi! Forget that, you are a relative! You know my aunt, Baljeet? She is married to a Khanna. They live in the Cable lane. Where do you stay in Khanna? I am from Delhi. Khanna is my surname. Delhi isn't far away either. If there is no traffic, it's just seven hours away, give or take. Don't tire yourself. I'll come over there and give them to you. Stay there. Your name is quite interesting. It is not interesting. It is troublesome. While filling forms, I run out of space before my name ends. You know what happened? My grandfather wanted to make me a Major. And my father wanted to send me to Germany. And Mann is our caste. I have taken four interviews till now. All four of them made fake documents to get a visa. But I am pleased to meet an honest person like you. Let's begin the interview. Look Sonia, honestly speaking, if you give me the visa... -I won't be coming back from England. -Really? But I can give you a visa only for 15 days. What will I do with a 15-day visa? Look, the flight itself is eight hours long. It takes around two hours to get out of the airport, including toilet break. So in total I need a 12-hour visa. I won't come back. Then what about your 100 acres of land? I have added an extra zero to it. I have only 10 acres. Ten acres is a lot. You can get a car in the dowry. But I am not into dowries and all. I want to go abroad. Please give me the visa. It was a pleasure to meet you. Sonia, just because I am going abroad... it doesn't mean that our story ends here. You can write your address and your phone number on the last page of the file. I promise I will call you once I go abroad. I always keep my promises. That is true. She isn't with me. My father has come with me. He is waiting downstairs. Did I get the visa? You give it to me so quickly. This is the benefit of being a Punjabi. He is trying for England. It would be great if he pulls through. Father, come with me. Shall I book the tickets? Yes, to go back to the village. I will be stupid to think about going abroad again. Brother, I have to go abroad at any cost. Let's try once again. Let me tell you, you have no hope left. -Boota. -No, you won't get it. -Boota. -It's impossible. Go away. You won't get it. -You. Listen. -You listen to me. Boota, why don't send him to Germany? Uncle, his visa application for Germany has already been rejected three times. I think this time embassy will stamp abuses on his passport. Will that be fine? Boota, do they also teach a song or something inside, before the interview? Uncle, they don't interrogate for murder in there. He has a bad habit of telling the truth. Tell me something. Why doesn't he say what's written in the file? Son, it will be a huge favor. Do something about him. Otherwise, his aunt will laugh at both of us. Sir, people laugh at me. There was a Visa, but your dearest played He played with my reputation Boota please do. Help me, brother. I swear, I won't tell the truth. I will lie so much that even criminal shows will make a feature on me. Okay then. It will cost you 350,000 rupees. Okay, sir? Your job will be done. GURU RAKHA BIRTHDAY PARTY FREE WITH A WEDDING. TO BOOK A PROGRAM GIVE US A MISSED CALL ON 9814569677 What is this nonsense! You should have come in a car or something. Nowadays even eunuchs come in cars. At least take my reputation into consideration. -I came here quite often. -Hello, brother. This baby elephant is very lucky for us. And listen. Don't underestimate me. I have done four tours in Malaysia. Principal in the school of idiots. Which dog was listening to you in Malaysia? You guys are worse than me. Stubborn monkeys. Let's go. Hey! Major? Let me talk to them, okay? I will do all the talking. You just sit with your mouth sealed. Or don't sit. Still I will do all the talking. This isn't a classroom. We will first interview you. Then if Mr. Wilson wants, we will also test your music skills. Mr. Wilson wants to know when did you guys meet? We just met outside, in the parking. He means today we met in the parking. We have known each other for the past 10 to 15 years. Yes. How many shows you have in England? Four. You didn't look at this. Okay! Four. You please come this way. He will take us down. How much are you being paid for this trip? -3,000. -300,000. He said 300,000 per show. This is bad. He pays us only 3,000. Drag them out. Hit him! Hit him! You ruined it for us! Please don't hit me. We got a chance to perform in England with great difficulty. They are hitting him. They are hitting him. Save him. You need his help. I'll pay a hit man to get rid of you. You are a fraud. Go! Come on. The police is here! Police! Police! The police is here! Run! Run! Boota, please listen to me. Listen to me! Get out of my office! Otherwise, I'll hire goons to beat you up. Listen, son Once my son boards the plane, you can take the money you want. Uncle, I don't want your money. Hello, PT teacher for monkeys. My father didn't say 1.2 million. Shut up. I don't want to talk to you. Uncle, you were talking about 1.2 to 1.4 million. Okay, you can take 1.4 million. But I like my respect more than money. Okay then, 1.5 million. No. Listen Boota, 1.7 million, final! That's it. -How much did you say? -1.7 million. 1.7 million? You are making a bad deal, father. Look at his face. Does he deserve to get 1.7 million? Shut your mouth. Aunt, sorry, uncle. Respect can be earned again. One never knows when one gets a chance to make 1.7 million again. How can German not go aboard when I am here? Shame on me and my office! Start making preparations. -Will it work? -It will. Of course it will, Mr. Mann. Do one thing. Lift your hand. No, put that hand down. Yes. This one like this. Close your eyes. When I say three, you use it. -Use what? -The deadly weapon. One, two, three. Oh, you can do it. A girl who is a citizen of England will come here. She will do a fake wedding with you and she will fly back to England with you just like an eagle. This parcel from England is really extra large. That eagle will kill this mouse. Let's go. Here's the board. Where are we going? Boota has asked me not to talk to you. You should go and talk to him. Which idiot Boota are you talking about? I don't know any such person. Look, he might be an idiot but he is my brother. I cannot say anything. -You talk to him. -Wait. My name isn't Geet. It's Komal. With the heavy hand you have, your name should be King Kong. Here we are. -You have come to pick us up? -Why? Are you my father's brother-in-law's son who I've come to pick up? -Move aside. -Why did you taking the longer route? Couldn't you say uncle's son instead? You have come to pick me up? If I had been so lucky, I'd have gone to Germany three years ago. Idiot, then why are you holding a board with my name on it? I am Geet. Get my bags. Listen to him talk! -Which one of them is your bag? -The red one. My name is Lakkha Jhol. One in a million, Lakkha. You don't know me. Idiot! Who is he? How does it concern you? Let's go. Oh my God! She is so beautiful. -How did she agree to marry German? -Shut up. God bless you, son. Be well, my son. Congratulations, German. Who is he? The middleman. This tiny one is the middleman? Son, you should wear decent clothes for the wedding. We took 1.7 million from you. But that doesn't mean that even old wrecks insult me. He is the one paying1.7 million. He doesn't look like he can pay 1.7 million. And listen. This isn't our first wedding. Okay, but it is my first wedding. Come with me. -Here, brother. Have some sweets. -Congratulations. Take this, sister-in-law. Have some sweets. Make sure your blood sugar has been checked. Did you look at the girl? She is so beautiful. I don't understand how did she agree to marry German? You keep your mouth shut. I thought everything has already been discussed but there is nothing like having a face-to-face conversation. Tell me, I am listening. You won't believe it, but I cannot lie. It might be a fake wedding but my desires are real. My aunt is about to have a heart attack. And there is commotion in the village. You just don't ask. She doesn't need to ask. You are saying everything on your own. Well, I had come to give this money. I have already given 500,000 to Boota. And I have given you 300,000 earlier. And here's another 300,000. I'll give the rest once I go abroad. Give it to me as soon as we reach England or else I won't sign on the citizenship report. Your height and your attitude match. What do you mean? Straightforward, like a stick. Don't get beaten up by a stick. You are getting married tomorrow. Go and dance. Listen, brother. I am ready to pay 2.7 instead of 1.7 million. Can this fake wedding turn into a real one? Cutting the cake and having it too? Don't lose the cake because of your greed. She is very hot-tempered. What was he saying? He said there is no commode in the bathroom. I said it's not a big deal. We will manage. Dust the sheets before you spread them. Arrange the chairs. Go and keep the sofa in my room. German! Yes, father? Son, what if our lie gets caught? No, father. Don't worry. I will turn this lie into the truth in a few days. And your son likes your fake daughter-in-law. God bless you. -I'll go and meet the cook. -We are there. -Yes. -There you go. -Get down. -Major! -Yes, uncle? -All good? Yes, uncle. All good! -What brings you here? -Hey! Everyone in the village is talking about German's wedding. I thought I should go and inquire. I heard that you are getting married to a citizen of England? -I swear, I don't believe it. -Why? Are you my wife's uncle that I need to convince you to get married? And what do you mean by inquire? Oh no, let's see. Hey, this means it is true. Bitto, she is wearing hot pants. I find her to be hot. She agreed to marry German? I swear, I don't believe it. No, I didn't see anything. Get this straight. Before I thrash you in front of the whole village, go near that wall, eat some fritters with green chutney and leave. One more thing. Don't eat cottage cheese fritters. You can have the cauliflower fritters. Cottage cheese fritters are for my relatives. Go. Let's go, Bitto. -Take him along. -Hmm. Go. German. German, I was wondering, your family will be the bride's in-laws. So you should send the girl to our place. We'll be her maternal family and your family could be her in-laws. Why are you in such a hurry, aunt? We are getting married tomorrow. We both will be there. You can look at her every day. No, I was just wondering, she came all by herself. Where is her family? We still haven't started serving lunch. Do you know who I am? How should I know? Are you the bride's father? -Yes, I am. -Get lost. Hey, serve me some more fritters. This is my daughter's in-law's house. Where will I eat, if not here? What are you saying? How can girls get married without their parents? -Come here! -Get this straight! I will start protesting right here! Let me warn you. -Get lost! -You! Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Boota, you better talk to the waiter. Otherwise, I'll teach him a lesson. Enough, try to understand. Son, the girl is so beautiful. Her face doesn't match with her father at all. Yes, she has taken after her mother. Look how beautiful she is. As if her mother is Madhuri Dixit. Their complexion is bad. Sister, it is not easy to earn pounds. You have to lose your heart and your color. Right? Sister-in-law, what are you doing over here? -Go and make tea for the guests. -Yes. Where did you get these oldies from? You should have brought some decent looking parents for her. Mr. Mann, they are hard working decent people. And he is also the head of the labor union. I don't want him to sit for protests. Look at his face. Does he look like my father-in-law? He looks like Chris Gayle's father-in-law. Boota, the father-in-law can be ignored. But at least the mother-in-law should be decent looking. -I am leaving then. -Wait. Stop it, father. Don't interrupt. What stop it? One has a right to joke after being two pegs down. You can drink three and joke with me. Leave them alone. Son, we deserve to get rings as a wedding gift. Don't make me stuff your mouth with a gold bangle. Not the mouth, it's worn on the wrist. This one is stuffed in the mouth. Ignore this greedy man, son. But do pay us before we leave in the evening. You will get your pay, aunt. But you have to keep two things in mind. -What? -You don't take any parcels when leaving. And you will open your mouth only to eat. All your replies should be just in murmurs. And get this straight, Boota. Make sure they dress well. -Understood? -Okay. Done. -Take them away. -Okay. -Let's go, father. -Let's go. You shouldn't talk too much. Let's go. Geet. I have a condition. Oh really? You have that right? Lakkha! What is it, Geet? Did he say something? Yes? He is putting conditions on me. No, I said it by mistake thinking about the wedding. It isn't my condition. It is my request. Tell her to wear decent clothes while she is in this village. Why? Do these clothes cause trouble? No, but she can at least try to dress decently. She is from England. She isn't from here. Tomorrow, you will also want her to clean the floor. You know that here girls wear such clothes only when playing badminton. She will get married in an Indian attire, right? I'll go to Patiala and get a few beautiful Patiala dresses for her. -Brother, aunt might end up insulted. -Okay. Now he is talking. Okay, she will wear Indian dresses. But it will cost you another 25,000 daily. Let's fix a lump sum. It will last only for five to six days. Fine, give a lump sum amount of 100,000. I would like to praise you. -I have never seen a leech like you. -No problem. Then good luck dressing her up in Indian attire. Fine, I will pay 100,000. Good. -Congratulations. -Congratulations. Congratulations to you too. -Congratulations. -Thank you. Congratulations, aunt. Son, don't be too pleased. She is taking money to get married. Otherwise, you will get upset later. Father, she is worth it. It's not a problem if I have to bear some more trouble because of her. And as elders say, you have to die to visit heaven. Geet, now you are just like family. Can I make a request? Don't get too cozy. It will cost you. Don't worry about the money. I'll manage it like this. Lakkha, please come here. Yes? He says he wants to spend some money. Money will be spent like this. Look at this. Honestly speaking, I feel like puking when I see you. Just like when you feel like puking sitting on the last seat in the bus while traveling to Shimla. Fine, then you sit on the engine of the bus to Shimla and I will get our plane ready and start packing. How many bags do you have that you need time to pack? You have one small red bag. It won't even take five minutes. Fine, then I will be back in five minutes. Lakkha, please listen to me. God will bless you. Tell her to be a little polite towards the villagers. Otherwise, they will get suspicious. Per day or lump sum? Lump sum? One hundred thousand. Fine. You can take it from the cash gifts. Hand over the rest to me. -Lakkha, you should start packing. -Yes. -Father! -Yes! -Give me 100,000 rupees. -Why do you need it? Meeting and greeting? Your hand please. Congratulations, German. Take it. This is for you. And this is for your wife. Give it here. Take this. This is not fair. This is not fair. Why are you crying, headman? You too go ahead. Get lost! We don't get along with you. Go away. -What was this? -Meeting and greeting? Give me the money back. -Why? -Give me the money back. Fifty thousand is enough. If she keeps greetings so freely, you will get loads of gifts. Come on, let's take some photographs. Come on, come here. She had brown eyes And a wheatish complexion She had brown eyes And a wheatish complexion She looked like an angel to me She just passed by me And stole my heart away She stole my heart away She stole my heart away She stole my heart away She had brown eyes And a wheatish complexion Blooming like spring was her beauty Her lips couldn't stop smiling Blooming like spring was her beauty Her lips couldn't stop smiling She shook my world She shook my world She is an enchanting witch! She just passed by me And stole my heart away She stole my heart away She stole my heart away She had brown eyes And a wheatish complexion She was wearing a bright red dress She bumped into me at the village fair She was wearing a bright red dress She bumped into me at the village fair The single strand of hair on her forehead The single strand of hair On her forehead targeted me She just passed by me And stole my heart away She stole my heart away She stole my heart away She had brown eyes And a wheatish complexion German. Son. Think about it once again. This is the most precious thing I possess. Father, the one I am giving it to is the most precious thing of my life. This necklace has big stones. Big stones to fulfill big desires. Yes. If it is so then go fulfill your desires. Go, my son. Hello! Where are you off to? Where are you going? -I am going inside. -I know that you are going inside. Is there a tunnel to England from here? Will I have to ask you to meet her for even two minutes? You can meet her in the morning. Go away. You cannot meet her now. Father, please come here. Tell him where I am going and what for. What happened? Talk to him. Yes? Hello. I seek your sickle's blessings. Fine. But who are you to question him? My son is going to be with his wife. If you try to stop him, then you can see this. I'll chop your head off. Monkeys like you are sold in the fair for 15 each. We have paid you 1.7 million. Come on, get lost. Go, there's the animal shed. Come with me. You can hear what we are going to talk about. No, brother. It is your family matter. You go and talk to her. And the love that your father expressed... Do you think I should tag along with you? -No. -Okay then. What are you doing here? Well, I... I thought you were a decent man. Don't do anything that would make me scream. Can I sit and talk to you? Fine. Well, my mother left me when I was small. Give me your hand. This necklace belonged to my mother. She wanted her daughter-in-law to wear it. Have you lost your mind? I am not your mother's daughter-in-law. But she thinks that you are. I have spoken to her. The sooner you get out of this feeling, the happier you will be. I think the more I stay in this feeling, the happier I will be. You are really crazy. What will you tell your father? Don't worry. I will talk to him. You don't need to say anything when there is love. They understand. Careful. Where are you going, brother? Delhi. Our flight for London is booked for tomorrow. -Why? -What do you mean why? You got married. Come to England with the marriage certificate. That's fine but if you leave so soon, then the villagers will get suspicious. They will start talking. Okay, so you want us to stay for a few more days? We can stay, but it will cost you. No problem. I'll pay. No, there is no need to make a deal for that. We have done so much work. We deserve a vacation. We didn't wash the utensils. Wait. I will carry it. Don't think too much into it. Father, go and give two to Boota. That's the deal we had made. Everything else is fine. Stop it. How much do you want to talk to your father? You just came from there yesterday. Lakkha, England is very beautiful. You might be a cheap person, but I cannot express how beautiful England is. Give me a hug, brother. Get lost! He wants a hug! Okay, now stop acting. -And pay the 10,000 pounds you owe us. -Yes. Which 10,000 pounds? I don't have anything. Listen to me. I just have 3700 rupees. All tenners. I removed them from the garlands. You had promised that you will pay us the balance in England. -Lakkha, check his bag. -Give it to me. Where are you hiding the pounds? We have brought you to England, not Bangladesh. Let me see how you won't pay us. Sorry. Knickers. Another one. More knickers! Did you bring anything to wear over them? Or have you brought only knickers? I had told you to talk about the money! -Where is our payment? -Where is our payment? I am not sitting at the Ferris wheel counter that I can give you cash immediately. Ferris wheel counter? He is talking about the London Eye. Why don't you understand? Don't worry, Geet. I am in England now. I'll earn 10,000 pounds like this. Stop it. Pounds, like this! They named him Major German Singh Mann like he is the only king of Jaipur. You will have to pay. Don't worry, Lakkha. We will handle it. There is no "we" in it. You will have to handle it alone. Whose bag is this? Come here with the bag. Lakkha! I wish to eat food cooked by my father Which father used to feed you dosas in the bathroom? If you want to eat radish stuffed bread, then come outside. Lakkha? I wanted to ask, how does one have a bath over here? There's a shower. Use it. That I understood. I know how to bathe. I wanted to ask, how do you wash it? Here you don't wash, you wipe it off. And don't think too much about washing. Think about earning. -Can I say something? -Yes, say. At first, I thought you were dirty from the outside. But now I know that you dirty from the inside as well. Wait, you! Get this straight. Don't touch the flour. I'll come and make the dough. You drive well, son. -You are a citizen? -Of course I am. But you look like you have just come from India. I might be a villager but I think like a city person. I found a citizen, gave her 1.7 million. She came to India to get married. And I end up here within 15 days. You can find such girls here? Like this! They queue up. Let me tell you something. They wear such short hot pants. They drink these big bottles of liquors. -Such big bottles? -Yes, these big bottles. You can increase or decrease the length of their shorts but the size of the liquor bottle doesn't decrease. Strange. Anyway, God bless them. Do one thing. Take the test and get a license made. You have gotten the job. Goodbye, uncle. -Okay, then. -Bye. Lakkha! Lakkha, my brother! Lakkha! Your brother's first salary. Hard earned money, 47,520 rupees. What 47,520 rupees? It's just 500 pounds for us. You still need to pay 9500 pounds to Geet. -German! -Yes? I have loaded the goods. It should be there before 6:30 a.m. At 6:00 a.m.! -Here's the paperwork. -Okay. -Goodbye. -Okay. My truck races through on GT road It will stop directly at Pathankot My truck, my love I have Hema Malini's photo Stuck to the mirror I look at her when I miss you Who is he? Looks like one of ours. Sir, one minute please. Can you drop me off in the next city? Come on, get in. Thank you, brother. How are you? Thank you very much, brother. My name is Amrik. I am from Ludhiana. Okay, okay, okay. Amrik Singh. Your name suggests that someone in your family had a desire to go to America. You are absolutely right. How do you know that? My name is Major German Singh Mann. My father wanted to send me to Germany. Look where we meet, in London. You are right. Let's have some to celebrate the occasion. Have you lost your mind? Don't you know how many responsibilities a driver has? You want me to get drunk? Don't drink if you don't want to. Why are you getting angry? Don't drink if you don't want to. Who says I don't want to drink? We will park and drink. Play some song. I don't know how it works. It's not my truck. You can try. Okay, I'll play it. It plays from here. Your trailer has been detached. What is it saying? Shut it. Here you go. It's not working. I'm done. I have to leave by 4:00 a.m. -Fine then, bottoms up. -Bottoms up. -Here you go, brother. -Here. -I'm off to sleep. -Okay, brother. -Okay, good night. -Good night. Night. Come on brother, come inside. How are you, buddy? Good. How about you? What's the time? Six o'clock. I was to report at 6:30 a.m. I am half an hour early. Take your goods off. -Which goods? -Don't you get it? Get your goods off. Which goods are you talking about? Idiot. It's already gone. Your trailer has been detached. Brother, you could have come half an hour late but you should have at least brought the goods with you. Come on, move this truck and bring the other truck forward. What will happen? Get lost from here! Don't show me your face again. Try to understand. I don't have any work for you. Auntie, I will have to leave England. Have mercy on me. Fine, son. Tell me, what work will you do in this boutique? Oh, come on! I was friends with Kaka, the tailor. I know how to cut, fold and iron clothes. Really? I can place my hand on your hot iron and... Swear upon it? You are funny. Fine, I'll give you a job. Okay, but you will get only 300 pounds per week. -How much per month? -1200. -How much in Indian rupees? -You do the math. I will not be able to send it to India anyway. Nine times twelve. In this way, it will take a year to pay Geet. -It's OK. -OK, tell me something. Can you at least converse in English a little? A little? I am great in English. Go ahead and test me. Really? Okay. If you want to say "come here." To whom? -Here? -Yes. Okay. And if you have to say "go there?" Go there. -There? There? -Anywhere. You think this is a difficult question. I'll go there and say come here. Fine, start working. Hello. You? What are you doing here? You didn't come to collect the installment so I was worried. I thought I should inquire about your well-being and also give you the installment. Who gave you the address of this place? I took it from Lakkha's drawer. Really? Didn't you feel ashamed? People here don't touch other people's personal belongings. I wanted to discuss something very important. What did you want to talk about? What are you trying to prove? That you are very handsome and you have a very impressive personality? Geet, I... I want to take you out for dinner. Why? Why should I go to dinner with you? I love you. I told the sooner you get rid of this feeling, the better it would be. But you didn't get me. No, you don't want to understand. Wait. Ricky! How are you, bro? All good? Ricky and I are getting married next month. Lakkha will be attending it. So you too can attend it. Anyway, you have a good experience of handling a wedding. Right? Have a look. Look buddy, you and I are from Sangrur. We are brothers. You don't have to worry. You are unnecessarily working for 50 pounds a day. Spend a little and become a permanent resident. It is expensive. Twenty thousand pounds is hardly a huge sum. Do one thing, pay half before the wedding and half after the wedding. -Okay? -Hey Brinda. -It won't cause a commotion, right? -Commotion? I am not selling you the London Bridge that I'd cause a commotion. You'll make me a citizen? Brother, you can become a permanent citizen only after you get married. You are not bread that I can bake you in an oven. Hey bro, what's up? Hey Hey, How is this? How are you? Serve me a drink, bro. It's stiff! I have explained everything to him. He agreed. -Come on! -Come here, then. -Stand next to her. -Now you two are set. For performing a fake marriage with a Punjabi boy to help him get citizenship. But last night, you told me how you perform fake marriages. You will have to answer me. You mean to say that you got married but it wasn't fake? Neither meet nor try to meet Geet. I know that you went to India on May 7th with Lakhwinder Johal. We will find that Punjab boy in a few days. So it would be better if you tell us the truth. Yes, I got married. But mine was a genuine marriage. Oh, so this is a genuine marriage? Call your husband and ask him to come here right away. What happened? Can't get through? I know you got married for money. And you two don't stay together. I told you! Mine wasn't a fake marriage. My marriage is genuine. My husband has gone to Vegas with his friends. Then why didn't you go with him? I don't like Vegas and gambling. When is he coming back? You will come here with your husband in two weeks. We will interview both of you. If you are unable to prove that your marriage is genuine, then you will get five years imprisonment and a 100,000 pounds fine. Ricky! Ricky! Ricky! Where are you going? My cousin in Manchester was in an accident, -Terry. -But I need you. Geet, try to understand. My cousin needs me too. -He is all alone over there. -What will I do, Ricky? Ricky! Ricky! Now you are more concerned about your cousin! Why don't you understand? Immigration officers know that German and I performed a fake marriage. Look, Geet. I'll appoint the best lawyer in the city for you. But I will have to leave right away. But Ricky, I did all this for both of us. I know, darling. I know. I will be back in a few days. Please, try to understand. For two bucks. Bro, have you seen this boy anywhere? -Yes, I have seen him. -Really? Where? -He used to work for us. -Okay. He didn't show up. He worked for 15 days and then he didn't show up. Where did he go? Any forwarding address or anything? No, I don't know where he went. No woman can be so tall. I think our guy made a mistake. I will have to do something about it. Forget it, it's not important. Within two weeks, you will come with your husband. One interview will happen If you can't prove that your marriage is genuine, then it's five years imprisonement and a 100,000 pound fine. Hey! German! She is Mayor Adam Bell's daughter. The white gown I had asked you to iron, is it ready? -It is ready. -Get it. What the hell, Major! What happened! The gown was fine till yesterday. What did you do? It was very big, aunt. It would have trailed behind her like a carriage behind horses. It is a wedding dress. If she would have tripped on it and broke her bones, then who would have been held responsible? Major. So I cut it short. Now she can dance all she wants in it. It's okay, aunt. Excuse me. Stay here. She is getting married. Soon she will have children of her own. I made this dress for her daughter. Get up, aunt! It's okay. Get up, aunt! Don't worry. Get up, aunt! How are you? Is everything fine? I am okay here, just travelling. Going to the office for work. Why are you following me? When did I follow you? You have a habit of lying. Look, you paid me. You got the citizenship. Now go and mind your own business. I take this bus to work every day. I go there every day at this hour. I am not following you. Listen to me. This is England. Here you need money to fulfill your dreams. I wanted to settle in Liverpool after getting married to you. That's why I did all this. But I didn't ask you for any clarifications. I don't complain either. Why are you troubling me? No, I... just... If there are any grudges, then we can talk. You have grudges and complain if you have an ego or arrogance. And there is no place for these things in love. But if you still think I am coming in your way then forgive me. I won't do it again. German. I have searched the whole city looking for you. -Come with me. -Where? The immigration department has gotten suspicious about us. We need to give an interview. I have to report to work at 11:00 a.m. I am not free. What are you doing? Why aren't you listening me? Have you lost your mind? You are worried about your work? If the immigration department finds any proof, You don't even understand English! They will send you back to India. I don't need your help. I'll handle it on my own. Have you gone crazy? You are in deep shit. I am not. It's not like they are about to declare my high school results that I would be in deep shit. Understood? You are in deep shit because the immigration department caught you. Now you will be put behind bars. I will handle my situation in my way. Understood? Listen. I think we both need each other. And other times, it's "get lost." You are just as unpredictable as the weather. Okay, I could think about it if you apologize. This was just a facade. I want it to be said with feelings from within. I know a little English. But I want you to apologize for everything, in Punjabi. That too in one breath. I have troubled you a lot. I apologize for that. Oh God! No day has ever been as beautiful as today. Come on, let's go and prepare for the interview. Let's go. Groceries and bills have been taken care of All we need to take care of is the rent It's close, dear It's your beloved drink Tell me, what do I need to do? Our interview will take place next next Monday. We will stay together in my apartment for the next two weeks so that we can get to know each other better. The same apartment which has a sea view? It's not a sea, it's a river. Thames river. We will stay together? Yes, we will stay together. I'll also show you the London Bridge. I'll take you to... A beautiful tall maiden Her eyes are like a deep ocean She is a beauty God has taken His own Sweet time to make her Even the sun is awestruck Even the sun is awestruck When it is blessed with your presence Water feels blessed When you take it to your lips Water feels blessed When you take it to your lips There is no one like you Even the angels are jealous of you Even the best damsels Cannot be compared to you Even the best damsels Cannot be compared to you Your cheeks are milky You apply cream on them daily Water feels blessed When you take it to your lips Water feels blessed When you take it to your lips When you smile, Millions of flowers blossom Hey my fair lady, You don't need to apply any make up Even the snake wants to be kohl Even the snake wants to be kohl When you wish to apply some on your eyes Water feels blessed When you take it to your lips Water feels blessed When you take it to your lips We have to take my parents along. You got married? But didn't you go to Scotland to attend your friend's wedding? How did you end up getting married? I had gone to Scotland, mom. That's where I had met him. We fell in love. So, we got married. Who have you got here! If you had to get married without informing us, then you should have found someone better. Ricky was much better than him. Don't have any doubts. I am English at heart. England is as much mine as it is yours. You didn't think it was important to even call and inform your mother? Mummy, everything happened in such a hurry that I didn't get any chance to think. Whenever you shop in a hurry, you buy the wrong things. Mummy, where's papa? I called him at the truck station. He is coming. He is on his way. He'll be here soon. Papa! Shit! Damn. I mean, oh my goodness! It's boss! Papa! Papa! Geet, you know how upset I was with you? Yes, papa. But I am pleased that you got married to a Sardar. -Really, papa? -Okay, I forgive you. Papa, he is your son-in-law, Major German Singh Mann. But why is he looking the other way? German, papa? Why are you feeling shy like a new bride? Show me your face. Okay, I forgive both of you. Do you really forgive us? Yes. Oh. German, you? So, you got married to my daughter and became a citizen? -Yes. -So you gave her 1.7 million rupees and she went to Punjab to get married to you. Satwant, you know this boy gave her 1.7 million rupees and she went to Punjab to get married to him. Don't you have any shame? You have cheated us. Sorry, papa. -I needed the money. -You needed money? I have always given double the pocket money you asked for. Tell me, did I ever stop you from doing anything? And who did you get married to? I have never seen anyone more duffer and overconfident than him. A container worth 20,000 pounds, filled with fresh fruits, he parked it on the road and went to sleep. He was that sleepy. Get lost from here! Don't show me your face! -Papa... I... -What papa? Get lost from here. I feel ashamed that my daughter got married for money. And a fake marriage at that! Look, you can throw me out of your house if you want. But please let your daughter stay here. Where will this poor soul go in this condition? What is wrong with Geet? You are going to be a grandma. What? Look, no matter what you say, my daughter won't leave this house. Okay then, goodbye. Please forgive me, if possible. Papa. -Papa. -German! -Yes, daddy? -If I see you even anywhere close to my house, I'll shoot you. Out! I am going, daddy. German, my son! Stay. Listen, our daughter is pregnant. What will we tell everyone? Think about that as well. Go to hell, I don't give a damn. Take it inside, kid. Mummy, what you said about son-in-laws is very good. Please make some rice and curry. I am hungry. Okay, I'll make it. Geet is sleeping on the floor and German is sleeping on the bed. What are you saying? Go and see it for yourself. What? Let's go. Mummy? Good morning, mummy. Come in. Good morning, son. -She is still sleeping? -No, mummy. She is very fortunate. She sleeps soundly. What happened? Is everything alright? It's nothing, son. I just came to tell you to get ready as I am preparing your breakfast. Okay. You should stay within your limits. Don't try to get personal. How many times have I told you that! Don't make me angry. If your mother had seen you sleeping on the sofa, then you would have been wearing prison clothes. Go and have a bath. Daddy. I know you are upset with me. But let me tell you the truth. German is a very nice guy. Tara writes from London! Tell me what's happening in the village, my friend! What is this? In England? No, it's not that. It is a toy. You won't find anyone smarter than him. Give him a chance. From where did you get this wild man? Does he even know how to live at home? Crazy man! Throw him out of our house! What happened? What happened here? How did this happen? He dares to call me daddy! Mother, you should at least keep some wipes handy at home. -What happened to her suddenly? -What happened? -What happened? -What happened? -It happened last night as well. -Tell me what's wrong! It happened last night as well. Get up. -It's okay. Let's go inside. -Mummy. -Mummy! -Hey. at least tell me what's wrong. -It's okay. It's okay. -Let's go inside. -It's okay! -What happened? I thought that you could only talk. But you can think on your feet as well. From now on, you won't cause any trouble in front of papa. Do you understand? Here's a pen and a notebook. -And start preparing. -Preparing for what? For the interview. This wasn't the deal. It will cost you 500 pounds. Fine. Now leave. What "fine?" First pay then the job will be done. My account balance is zero at the moment. And I won't ask papa for money. I'll remove some from his cupboard in the evening and pay you. Now leave. To take stolen money is like stealing. German! -Give me your slippers. -What is it? There! What? What did I do? Okay, your size is eight and a half and mine is seven and a half. My size is eight and one quarter. Stop your nonsense. -I use size eight. I am telling you. -I told you to shut up. Now tell me, on which side of the bed do you sleep? I sleep on the right. I don't sleep on the bed. I sleep on a cot, with the head on the other side. And my cot is right under the fan. I fear heights the most. You? I didn't even prepare so much for my high school exams. If I had, I would have stood first. I fear... Do you know how to give the right answer to any of the questions? You keep lying. Mitha? What is wrong with him? I think he got bullied again. There is an issue of racism over here. Mitha is very innocent. He gets scared quite easily. Innocent? He comes after me like a bully. Hurry up, son. Your beans are ready. Mom, I don't want to eat beans today. You make beans every day. What else do you want to eat? Tell me. Idiot. Mummy, give him some buttermilk. It will refresh him. It will scare the Englishmen away. And fried food isn't healthy. Give me some stuffed bread. I will eat it. Okay, son. I'll make some right away. Mom, I'm going to the gym. Dear, you just had a contraction yesterday. You should stop going to the gym. -Nothing had happened to me, mom. -What? Nothing happened because I was with her. I was with her. -Anything could have happened, mother. -Yes, son. This problem can take place anytime. Do one thing, take German with you to the gym. I said, take him with you. -It will cost you 1000 pounds. -Get lost! Come if you want or don't. What happened, son? What is she saying? Nothing, mother. She asked me to hurry up. Roll the bread and give it to me. Okay. She has found a nice husband. He is so innocent. Stop it already. You'll erode your bones with so much running. Plastic dolls like you pose like this at clothing stores. Come on. Do you want to increase your weight or decrease it? If you want to increase, then have bananas and cream. If you want to decrease, then have lemonade with honey. In lukewarm water. Let me exercise. Go and mind your own business. Here's your 1000 pounds. Take it. Mummy has done some shopping for you as well. Here's the bag. I think she spent a lot of money on me. Well, it's all about how much you love your dear ones. Earlier you looked only like a thug. Now I think you are a murderer as well. Give them back. I will, give me a minute. -German. -What's happening here? Nothing's happening. Go and mind your own business. Tell me. Tell me. Elders say that sorrow decreases when shared. Last year, when Ricky and I were coming out of a club, we were cornered by a few foreigners. Come on, give me. We don't want any trouble! I'll give you what you want. Next morning, someone sent us these photographs. And started blackmailing us. Ricky gave all his savings to the blackmailer. I sold my car. And I started stealing money from papa's cupboard. We have so far given 17,000 pounds to the blackmailer. German, where are you going? German! There's the dead body of the man you stabbed. Brother, my name is Amrik. I am from Ludhiana. Don't push him! Don't hit him with this! Don't hit his head with a brick! -Wait, wait! -Don't kill him. Damn. You have lost your mind! Don't get me arrested! Thank you very much for saving me, brother, or else she would have killed me. Brother, Anthony and Ricky had given me 500 pounds to do this drama. There was someone hiding and taking pictures of all this. And both the blood and the dagger were fake. I know, once our own is in trouble, then how do we feel bad? Yes, I know Ricky cheated me. This doesn't mean that now you stand a chance. You have four days. Appear for the interview and get out of my life. German, who else do you have in your family? Everyone, except a mother. And I found one here. Why are you feeling scared, Mitha? They are just lanky boys. Hit them and move forward. I cannot hit anyone. If you cannot hit them, you can at least be brave enough to face them? Now if they hit you, don't feel scared. You will see that they will get scared and run away. No. German, he cannot do it. He has to gather the courage, mother. Today, they are telling him to leave the ground. Next, they will tell him to leave his house. And then they will tell him to leave this country. Come on, my boy, go and face them. You will have to get rid of your fear. Otherwise, it will keep killing you slowly. I think you should go there. Mitha stays quite happy these days. All this is thanks to German. By the way, For helping Mitha. I know. But that doesn't mean that now I stand a chance. Father's calling. Geet. Ricky was good. But German is very good. Geet. Ricky was good. But German is very good. This necklace belonged to my mother. She wanted her daughter-in-law to wear it. Geet! Where are you? Come here. I want to talk to you. Come here. Sit down. Look at this. Isn't this teddy very cute? -Yes, mom. -And look at this one. Look at these. A few baby pictures. Isn't this baby very cute? Look at this one. This one is so cute. Geet, every parent dreams of getting their children married, in a grand way. This dream of mine couldn't come true. But now I won't listen to you. To welcome my grandchild, I'll decorate this whole house. Get ready quickly. Your papa wants to go to the Gurudwara. Get ready quickly. I'll wait for you. Listen, your father seems to be in a good mood today. I suggest you should talk to him. Khalsa belongs to Lord. Victory belongs to Lord. Babaji, my daughter is pregnant. We want you to pray for her good health. You said this lie in front of mummy and daddy. Oh my God, how many lies have I said in front of you? Geet! What happened, dear? Geet! Why are you crying? Tell me what's wrong with you! Geet! Why are you crying, dear? Tell me. Geet! Are you feeling alright? I don't know why she is crying. Tell us. Why are you crying? Yes? No, papa. I am not alright. The truth is that the immigration department knows that German and my marriage is a fake one. They have asked us to come to their office on Monday. And you and mummy also have to be there. We lie that I am pregnant so that we could stay here. You could have told us the truth. How many more lies will the two of you tell us? I still doubt whether or not you are telling me the truth now. Look at your child, Satwant Kaur. You two should be ashamed for playing with our emotions. I can never forgive the two of you. Get lost from here! Satwant, ask them to leave or you will see me dead. Papa, please. Forgive them. You stay out of this, Mitha! You two should leave. Go away. Each moment feels like a decade My body is alive But my heart is slowly dying I cannot find any support I cannot find any support Even God has refused to help us My dear First you built Our own little world with love First you built Our own little world with love Then you broke our trust This isn't right, my dear Then you broke our trust This isn't right, my dear Not fair Not fair This isn't right, my dear Not fair This isn't right, my dear Yes, this isn't fair Why dream when I know My dreams will break All the hopes I had Will shatter Why dream when I know My dreams will break All the hopes I had will shatter We were only meant To be together for so long We were only meant To be together for so long You squeezed life out of me This isn't right, my dear You squeezed life out of me This isn't right, my dear Not fair Not fair This isn't right, my dear Not fair This isn't right, my dear Yes, this isn't fair My eyes have forgotten how to sleep, My love Now even the fans blow out hot air My eyes have forgotten how to sleep, My love Now even the fans blow out hot air I keep treasuring your memories After helping After helping After helping the kite of my life soar After helping the kite of my life soar If you let go of the thread Then it isn't right, my dear If you let go of the thread Then it isn't right, my dear Not fair Not fair This isn't right, my dear Not fair This isn't right, my dear Yes, this isn't fair It's not Geet's fault. She did all this to save her life and your honor. It was my fault. I lied to you and said that Geet was pregnant. Whether or not you forgive me, you should forgive Geet. Because when kids from good families end up in prison, then you lose your reputation. Geet, you like vegetables, right? And what's that you eat applying peanuts on the bread? What is it called? Peanut. And what do you eat with milk? Corn flakes. Please forgive me, Geet. I always get caught when I lie, since childhood. You had gotten me the citizenship. It was I who couldn't do the right thing. No. It is my fault. I shouldn't have gone back to Lakkha. I was never worthy of you. And I never will be. I will be arrested tomorrow. You will be deported to Punjab. That means we will never meet again Forgive me for all the stupidity, for all the mistakes I have done. If you ever come to India again then do pay us a visit. There are five questions on this sheet. Answer them and give it back to me. Then I will ask you about each other's life. Your parents didn't come, Geet? -They won't be coming. -I knew that this is a sham marriage. You are fooling the UK government. I'll make sure both of you get punished. Geet had come to Punjab in May to marry me. I had given her 1.7 million rupees. We got married and came to the UK. And we no longer live together. This is what you think, Brinda. But we live together at her parents' house. She is my real wife. Our marriage is not a sham. Papa, you came! Mother, thank you for not letting your anger get the better of you. Be careful, dear. This is the question of your life. Okay, mom. Let's go. Nothing. You start the interview. Geet, what's German's qualification? He's gone to high school. His biggest weakness. German's biggest weakness is that he cannot lie. His biggest dream? His biggest dream has always been to get out of India. What's German's shoe size? His shoe size? German, you have mentioned it as eight and a quarter. Ms. Brinda, let me explain. My shoe size is eight and a quarter. I stuff these to make them fit. You can put anything. A rag, a rolled up sock? So it is eight and a half that way. I told you it is eight and a quarter. When did you say it? Geet, what was the name of German's last girlfriend? German, now I will ask you five questions. Okay. Which game does Geet like the most? Basketball. Ask me why. Okay, I'll tell you. Tall girls like her either play basketball or clean ceiling fans. Geet had a boyfriend. What was his name? I know everything about him. What was his name? Ricky Manchanda. He lives in Manchester with his cousin. His village is close to Jalandhar, Zandu Singha. He is into quite a few illegal activities. He cheats rich girls. Pull up such cheap tricks. There isn't any bad thing he doesn't do. At the moment, what's the balance in Geet's bank account? Zilch. Nothing. You must be wondering that I gave her 1.7 million rupees so she must have a hefty bank balance. Zero. Eighty-five times zero is also zero. Nothing. I mean she doesn't have any money. Empty account. What is she saying? She's asking what's my body weight. -Tell her. -Shameless. She is asking you. -One load full. -What? Shut... What's the most precious thing in Geet's life? What is she saying? She is asking what's the most precious thing? My mother's necklace. -For whom did she mean? -Me. I told her about myself. I too had written the same reply. Mrs. Satwant Kaur, what's German's mother's age? Well... German was quite young when his mother passed away. Mr. Hardayal Kahlon. What was the first job German took up in the UK? German's first job in the UK, he was a truck driver. -Okay. -Goodbye. Brinda, just ask everything you want now. Or else she would keep troubling us. She is through. No daddy, she might come back and ask questions again. Let's end this once and for all. You ask whatever you want. She is through. Let's go. -Let's go. -Let's go. Thank you. Just you guys wait here, I am coming with the car. You guys still married? Strange! Will I for others only? I can't get married life Won't I get married and settle down? -I mean my better half, Pari. -Then what are you doing here? I've come to the immigration office for an interview. I need to become a citizen. Wait, you scoundrel. -Just joking. -You kept me worrying for six months! -He is very emotional! -What do you think you are! Brother, you can say whatever you want. You have citizenship. What do you know about the sorrows of soldiers like us in England? Let's go, Pari. We shouldn't waste time talking to rustic people. Let's go? Shall we?
