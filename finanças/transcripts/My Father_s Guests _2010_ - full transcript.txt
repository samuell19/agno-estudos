MY FATHER'S GUESTS - Medical SOS! - This is the place. Grandpa, Babette's here! Grandpa! They shouldn't have bothered you. At her age, they all panic at a drop of blood. Come on, Dad, she was right. You're really banged up. How did you do that? Dad's old bedroom window's jammed. It really took elbow grease. Why in the world would you open that? You did it? You've decided to take them in? It's in the works. Isn't that great? He's completely reorganized the association. It's incredible. Sure, he's a pro. I think it's great you're doing this. Really! Come in, Mrs. Delbard. Did your son give you the article I clipped for you? No. What article? On the legalization of abortion. Your name's mentioned twice. I made photocopies. It must be here somewhere. I'll look. Thanks so much, Mrs. Delbard. You don't mind eating off a tray? I'm so busy, I can't even find time to run out to a restaurant. But we'll do a family lunch one Sunday. That may be iffy for the next few weeks. My undocumented immigrants are moving in. Bring them along. We'd be delighted to meet them. Do you know who yet? A Senegalese family, supposedly. You know you're breaking the law? I looked into it the other day. Here it is! You could get up to five years and a 30,000 euro fine. That's reasonable. In my day, joining the Resistance or illegal abortions got you even more. What is this weird stuff? A foie gras mousse with figs. You'll do what you want anyway. With your glorious past, they won't put you in jail. But you do have one of the last rent-controlled apartments in Paris. And your landlord would love an excuse to evict you. I'll think it over. This is really weird. What if Chinese people open a sweatshop in his basement? Or Malians with a swarm of kids? Mom, you're just racist. Not at all. But we should think of all possibilities. Don't you think Grandpa thinks? Oh, Lucien's a great thinker. That's all he does. But he leaves the consequences to others. And since grandma passed away, that means us. Hello. Julie! I need a volunteer to go to the precinct with Mr. Thuong and I. I'd love to but... Go on, don't worry about me. Karine, how nice of you to stop by. So we can go then. Come on. See you tonight. He's my father-in-law. Lucien's your father-in-law? He's a remarkable man. He has a lot of energy. Always has. So... About his illegal aliens... What illegal aliens? The potential deportees who'll hide out at his place. You're mistaken. We do nothing illegal here. I understand. I understand completely. You can't say anything. But given Lucien's age, I'd like to protect him. Some people would be inadvisable. What people? Large families, small children, sick people, and we should avoid anyone who works at home. And anyone noisy. He writes a lot. He needs quiet. So your ideal undocumented immigrant is a Swiss old maid who lost her passport. He's old, he just had bypass surgery. Shouldn't we take some precautions? Sure. So? Can I count on you? Thank you very much. Is that dessert? It's just some clothes for those poor people. - Sorry, we came empty-handed! - We're all set. Clothes are a good idea. Go on in, I'll just be a minute. Let's see. Did you redo the living room? Yes, what can I get you? A little port. What is this thing? It looks like a tent. This is awful. We can't give them stuff like this. It's downright colonialist. I wore it just last winter. It's warm and cozy. That's a perfect description of a tent. Very funny. Babette's right. They need useful things, not nice things. Those are my nice things! - They're here. - I'll get it. Let me! Please, come in. I'm Karine. Hello! What's your name? Sorina. This is Tatiana and Sorina. My children, Babette, Arnaud. Rémi, my daughter's boyfriend. No Saint-Emilion unless you're 18. Who wants water? Is Sorina registered for school? Yes, she's in sixth grade. Chisinau schools are lousy but I tried to give her a good education. You both speak French very well. Sorina's English is even better. She can go to America one day. I preferred a private school. But the one near Lucien is okay. Arnaud and I went there. It was very good. I think it still is. Yes, it's very good. There aren't many Blacks or Arabs. That could cause problems. I beg your pardon? Tatiana lived through 20 years of communism, then 15 years of social decay. She doesn't see things through Western eyes. - Did I say anything wrong? - Not at all. I'm just saying that things are different in your country. I've read a few articles. Moldova's in turmoil these days. Riots, the Mafia, corruption... It's not the best place to raise a little girl. Because... it's pretty shitty. Excuse my language but it's true. We understand. Don't worry. Do you still have family in Moldova? I don't see them anymore. We don't get along. They're just a bunch of hicks. And they're mean to Sorina because her daddy's dead. It must have been hard for you. That's life! Life's always hard, isn't it? Can I smoke? Of course. I'll get the next course. Your bracelet's pretty. I really like it. Do you have a job here? Just odd jobs. That'll change when I get my papers. Really? So you hope to be regularized? Now that I'm married, it'll be a breeze. Thanks to Lucien. To help Tatiana get her papers, I married her on Friday. What? Strictly a marriage of convenience. I didn't send out announcements. I'm great at carving meat! Shall I do it? Be my guest. Do you speak Rumanian or Russian? Russian. And Tatiana's things? Yes, what about Tatiana's things? What things? They have a bag for her. Yes, we do. But... One minute! Follow me. I'll give them something, too! Wanna see my room? Boy, Dad! You're full of surprises. Now you won't have to worry. I'm legit. My rent control is safe. Did the association send her to you or did you pick her? I'd have done the same for anyone, Rémi. A militant act is a militant act. Well, some militant acts are easier on the eyes than others. There's nothing for her in there. Do I have anything that's... I give it all to the Red Cross. This one! How will he live with such a bimbo? He thinks anyone without a PhD is an idiot. Maybe she's got one. Don't judge a book by its cover. Well, the girl's polite. And we did avoid a large family. Really? I can keep it? Thank you. Simon! You gave her your Xbox? Yeah. You said not to give them old stuff. Lunch was delicious, your home is lovely. Everything matches like it all came from the same store. - Thank you. - Here. I'll take good care of your dad. We Moldovans love grandpas. Come on. Hurry up. Is that the Xbox he got for Christmas? What gets me is he didn't even tell us he was getting married. That's all that gets you? Aren't you missing something? You can't blame her for being beautiful and sexy. And I'm sure, in Chisinau, they don't find her vulgar at all. Babette, she's a whore! You're so bourgeois! I'm not bourgeois. I'm nouveau riche. It's not the same! And, I assure you, I can spot nouveau richewannabes a mile away. I'll be curious to see if she can get anything out of Dad. He's a tough cookie. She must be resourceful. This'll be interesting to observe. You're so prejudiced! That girl's ready to sink her teeth into the big capitalistic pie! - Her pretty teeth! - Very pretty teeth. She's a bombshell. A bombshell with a Milosevic ideology. So? Should we only help people who think like us? I think what Dad's doing is great. And once Tatiana gets her papers, we'll never see her again. You're so naïve. It's touching. Stop talking to me like that. I'm not 12 anymore! Come on, let's go. Right now? Not yet, calm down. Come on, let's not fight over that... That whore? Bye-bye. Thanks... for lunch. Babette! Bye, Rémi. Good job! I'm sorry, I wasn't very... I've had it with my father and my sister, their good conscience, their holier-than-thou certainties, their false generosity... And that Tatiana's so pleasant. She's nice, isn't she? I like her a lot. That whore? Hello, Dad? It's me. We have a concert this afternoon, remember? It's our subscription. Schubert. Schubert? Which piece? I've heard that 20 times. Why'd you choose that? We chose it together, Dad. I swear, we did. No way. No big deal. We don't have to go. We can give the tickets to Tatiana. She loves anything cultural and the poor thing's had so few occasions. But Lou Chou Ming is playing. Well, I was looking forward to hearing him. Maybe it is kind of selfish but... You know what? I'll try to get two more tickets, okay? I'll call you right back. I'm leaving. What's going on? And their long-term policy... It's idiotic you couldn't get two tickets. She must've been worried about Sorina. Dad, she was bored to tears. So how's it going with her? Fine. Do you run into them often or do you each keep to yourselves? - They are well behaved? - Absolutely. That's good. It's not easy to live with strangers at your age. I'm not a fossilized old geezer yet! It's quite pleasant to have a lively home "at my age." That's not what I meant, Dad. Do we really have to stay for the last sonata? I'm parked right here. - Going by bus or subway? - I don't know. I'll see. See you soon. See you soon. All this is for your dad's house. With the Moldovans, I have to make three times as much. It's a real mess over there. Your mom must be spinning in her grave. That'd surprise me. Mom was no xenophobe. Neither am I. You should see the apartment. Or her undies strewn around the bathroom. That's it, Mrs. Da Silva, tell me about my father's wife's underthings. That'll interest me. I really like your dad. This is no joke to me. All done. See you soon. You didn't note that little Traoré was allergic to penicillin. Yes, I did. There. We usually put that here. Isn't this more logical? Yeah, you're right. Mr. Medhi Messaoui. Follow me, sir. Hi, Dad. I was just wondering, did I see you on a city bike yesterday? You took out a subscription? Sure, exercise is good for you but... Am I calling at a bad time? That's great! She must be happy. What kind of job? We have to celebrate that. What if I stop by later with a bottle of champagne? I insist. It'll be a pleasure. You shouldn't have. Poor Tatiana's been on the phone with Chisinau for an hour. Even with the marriage, it takes at least six months to be regularized. We have to file with the French Consulate in Moldova to get a renewable, one-year residence card. Which is why she had to take this illegal job. What's that TV set? I thought you hated TV. Me? No, not at all. I've always watched the news. And it helps Sorina improve her French. I have to wash my hands. Is anything wrong? I thought the marriage would solve everything. But nothing's ever solved. I always need one more form. They always treat me like shit. I'm sick of being treated like this. Of course, I understand. But you'll get your papers in the end. You have a roof over your head, a job. Sorina's in a good school. Yeah, things are great in your dad's home. Lucien's very nice. Since he's old, I didn't think there'd be trouble. But with men there's always trouble. No big deal, I'm used to it. Trouble? You know what I mean. That's how men are. What can you do? I'm not complaining! Sorina's great here. There's no problem. What are you two up to? I opened the champagne. Champagne! Real champagne! That's Roederer! It's a cocktail. It's delicious. Taste it. You're right, it's not bad. It's good. Too bad I'm just a chambermaid. It's just a start. It's temporary. Everything's temporary. When Sorina's Prime Minister, we'll drink champagne every day. I'll bathe in it. Tatiana, please! Be careful! Sorry. That's our mother's credenza. Excuse me, but it means a lot to us. Lucien, can you get me an ashtray, please? This chambermaid job is impossible. It's out and out exploitation. Shitty hours, a shit job and a boss... He's a dirty old man. Just because she has no papers and can't defend herself. We absolutely must find a way to get her a work permit as soon as possible. I'm the wrong guy, Dad. I practice business law. I have nothing to do with immigration. You're legally married, just go through the proper channels. Sorry, you can't smoke in here. Why? The decree of November 15, 2006: "It is illegal to smoke in the workplace." Your son's a good lawyer. He really knows the law. There's a balcony over there. What do you want from me exactly, Dad? That immigration minister who's always on TV... Weren't you in college together? Gardier? Yeah, we took the bar together. Why? I'm just trying to foresee all possibilities. Gardier's a reactionary. He's as far right as it gets! I can't stand him. How's he a possibility? I don't know... Give him a buzz. You want me to ask someone I detest for a favor? Would you do that? In your circles, you must run into a lot worse. My circles? I have clients, that's all. That doesn't mean... Who do you think I am, Dad? I thought you were more flexible. Even if you have such a poor opinion of me, you know how I was raised. Okay, okay, let's drop it. I don't want to bend anyone's morals. But the girl's a nervous wreck. If we don't help her, she may go back to Moldova! And would that be a problem? You don't understand a thing. Where is she? I'll get her. Lucien's ready to leave. Do you have a cigarette, Mrs. Delbard? Yes, sure. Thanks a lot. Simon! It's so nice of you to come! But why here? Your son's not going pro, is he? It's his big game and he wanted to see Sorina. So it's an occasion. You mean Dad's coming to a soccer game? She's wearing the tent! In your honor. There's Grandpa! - Julie? - I'd love some. They're off! Aren't you cheering your son on? We all woke up at dawn on Sunday. You can't ask more than that. But you have to cheer, so he wins. She's so nice. - Oh, shit. - Is he crazy! What's come over him? You and I have to talk! I'm sorry. What a brute. You okay, Théo? Of course he's not. You're the real champ. That ref wants you to be a sissy. Screw him! But I got a red card! You have to fight in life! Excuse me, Tatiana. Don't absolve him. He was a savage! She's right. Why the rough stuff? You showing off for the girls? Doesn't the sight of blood give you an appetite? Can I have two sandwiches? Sure. You want ham, sweetie? Thanks so much. - You like ham? - I love it. Want a Fanta? You're so sweet. Did you see what I saw? I think I did. That's awful. He's like a dirty old man! Dr. Paumelle, women's rights activist, humanitarian! It almost makes him human. You think it's funny? She doesn't seem particularly shocked. He's 80 years old. What else can he do? He's helping her out, so he takes a few liberties in passing. Quid pro quo. Quid pro quo? Are you kidding? It's supposed to be a selfless humanitarian act. I don't think grabbing her ass was in the contract. So you realize he's not God the Father. That's good. You hate him! What? You hate him. - You like seeing him act dumb. - Bullshit. Mom! Are Sorina and I cousins now? No, not at all. Sorina's here. What? Sorina's in Simon's room. She came over to play. So? Maybe we can pump her for info. About what's going on at your dad's house. Karine, she's a little girl. She's playing with our son. She's not Mata Hari. Sorina! You lost your bracelet... I don't get it... the impact Moldovans have on the men in this family. Don't you knock on Julie's door? I did knock. I knocked. I'll have the same. - What's up? - Did you get this? I don't know. Why? You must have gotten it. It's the statement for our joint account with Dad. Mom's savings account. She left it to all three of us. We decided to hold onto it until it reached term. Yeah, so? Dad withdrew 75% of it without telling us. I don't believe it. That's so unlike him. He's the most scrupulously honest guy. It's almost a sickness. How could she bamboozle him like that? It's not just about feeling her ass. He's in love. You're right. Of course. That's what it's about - the bike, the scarf... He's in love! What can we do? Nothing. He's walking into a wall. It's his life. We can just deal with the cash. Oh, who cares? Screw the money. So, we drop it? We'll just drop it! I'm busted. Got any cash? I'll just go to the ATM. I'll be right back. Wait here. Fast! Run! I took off without paying! You're nuts! What's come over you? No idea. I've never done that in my life! Aren't you a bit old for those shenanigans? Tell that to Dad! It's usually guys your age who fall for young blonds. You're right! You're right! What a bastard! Not only did he ruin my childhood, now he's ripping off my midlife crisis! You know what? Beat him to Alzheimer's! That'll teach him! Do you think there's anything... physical between them? He just withdrew 15,000 euros from the bank. He's entitled to peek at her boobs! Just thinking about it really creeps me out! Sex is weird, isn't it? God knows, my patients give me an earful. But when it comes to parents... How do you think Mom and Dad were? Think she had orgasms? Cut it out! How do I know? I have no desire to think about that. Yeah, it's embarrassing! But why? We're adults, we should be able to talk about it. And you? Don't even go there. I'm not talking about my sex life. Don't bother. I know you have a tiny dick. Very funny. No, that's really... You know, Babette, that's... that's so funny... I'm hungry! Wanna get a bite? Have a little Sevruga! You'll see. Well? It's divine! It'll cost an arm and a leg! You come here often? Very often. What a bourgeois you've become! How do you do it? Considering how we were raised. Gimme a break! I'm just trying to be a little more Epicurean. Trying to enjoy myself. That's all. Do you feel good? Let yourself go. It's not so easy. I know. Karine taught me all this. Excuse me... but that swanky apartment of yours, that huge car... That's not epicurean. That's being in love with money. Karine's family was poor, she didn't go to college. Money, comfort reassure her. That's understandable. Sure. But that goes for Tatiana, too. Tatiana won't do Dad any good. Whereas Karine made me over. After 20 years of merciless criticism. Oh, come on! Dad was demanding but it wasn't the Gulag! Sure, you did everything right. Just like him. You had his unconditional approval. Stop! You can't compare my pitiful career as a pitiful G.P. with Dad's career path. I never felt I was up to his standards. Don't think that. I did think that. You're wrong. There! That's not a taxi! But it's stopping. Good evening. We're going to the 17th. We can drop you off. Hop in. - That's very nice... - Sure! No, please don't. Listen, thanks a lot but... Didn't we just see you at the club? At the club? No, no. We had dinner at a Scandinavian restaurant. On... What's that street called? Back there. Oh, okay. Anyway, it was dead tonight. Oh, I agree. The night's still young... It sure is! We'll get out here. Thanks so much for the lift. That was so nice. Arnaud, I don't understand. Come on! And you... Three vodkas and you're gone! They thought we were a couple. I got that, thanks! You said to let go. Yeah, for another order of blinis, not for incest with a couple of swingers. Really? How could I know? You're so dumb! What? Didn't you get my message? "I'm having dinner with my brother"? Yeah, about... eight hours ago. We had stuff to talk about. For eight hours? That's more talking than you've done in 10 years. What did you have to say that was so important? A problem with your dad? No, everything's fine. He burns cash, he's in debt, he's in love. Everything's just fine. But you know what? My 80-year-old father's life is more passionate than mine. Fine. I'm going back to bed. You don't look so good. A hangover's not like you. Really? What is like me? Always on time? Always cheerful? Always predictable? I'm gonna get a Tylenol. Oh, shit. They're all here already. Hello, everybody. Before 9, we're not really here. Can I go first? Mrs. Brichon, not a word before 9 a.m. Here. I'm sorry. It's just that... everyone always expects me to be such a good little girl... It's making me crazy. I have no expectations. Just watch out for Mrs. Brichon. What? Is it Thursday? Yeah. Why are all the depressing ones on Thursday? Why so optimistic about the rest of the week? It's 9 o'clock. The lions are in the arena. Buck up! You gonna be okay? Let's go! I'm sorry. It was involuntary. No, it's okay. Listen, maybe it was the wrong day for such a bad joke. Come in, I'll be right with you. Dad, I'm swamped this morning. What's up? One second. Have a seat! Where's the credenza? What did you do with Mom's credenza? It took up too much space, so we put it in the back room. Sit down. Okay, here's what's up. You know I never had a private practice, my pension is small, so I don't have much in savings. Anyway, you both make a good living. I know you don't expect an inheritance from me. So? So, Tatiana and Sorina have nothing. I'd like to give them a hand, to leave them something. Just leave them a settlement. It's nice of you to tell us but you don't need us for that. No, but I'd like them to have the works, you know. The works... You mean everything? You want to disinherit us? When you say it like that, it sounds melodramatic. I'm not trying to wrong you. I'd just like the money to go to those in need. That seems completely reasonable. On the other hand, if you feel you're in greater need, we won't mention it again. She asked you to do this? Tatiana's has a different background. Don't make judgments. So... Everything that was your mother's, like the credenza, will rightfully be yours. Legally, it's ours already. You only hold it in usufruct. Yes, of course, that's what I meant. Concretely, how do you plan to proceed? You can't usually disinherit your children. Exactly. I saw a notary. You can just renounce your inheritance yourselves. Is that okay with you? Yes. And you, Babette? No problem? Are those curtains new? Yes, they're new. Is this okay with you? Yes, Dad. Very good. Very good! That's taken care of. How about some coffee? No, thanks. I have to get back to the office. Fuck! What is it? What did I do? What did we do? What did we do wrong? We didn't do anything wrong. Yes, we did. We must have for him to... What did you do to him? Why does he love you more than us? What do you want? I'll get in trouble. He disowned us for you. How did you do it? Why are you making such a fuss? You don't need the money. I do. Doesn't Sorina have the right to a good education? I don't care about the money. But do you realize what this means? It means he's crossed us out of his life. We don't exist for him anymore. Keep your voice down. I did everything to please him. I studied medicine, my clothes, my boyfriends, everything! I read all his favorite books. I like the same painters, the same musicians. And you?! You're the exact opposite! What is it? Was it all a lie? Is my whole life based on a lie? How can he like you? With that dyed hair, that makeup... Don't touch me! Are you crazy? Don't touch me. I didn't hit you. Are you nuts? Nobody touches me! I need a cognac. You know, Tatiana, I've got nothing against you. I know you just want to give your daughter a better life. But there are limits. He's doing you a favor with this marriage of convenience. But you take advantage. Marriage of convenience? First he said I was beautiful. Then, "I love you." Then he got in my bed! Liar! I don't believe you! My father would never do that! Besides, he's too old. Viagra Why didn't you say no? You could have said no. I want Sorina to sleep in a house. Not a hotel. To stay in her good school. But Dad's not a bastard. He'd never have kicked you out for that. Are you sure? Are you really sure? For me, it's too dangerous to say no. I can't say no. With heart problems, you should go easy on the Viagra but... Your father's a doctor. And a good one. He knows what he's doing. Sure. If it's any consolation, my father's so pathetic he'd never disappoint me. That's not much of a consolation. She's younger than me and has to fuck an old man! Of course she's gonna bleed him dry. And poor Sorina's in the middle of all that. How could my family sink so low? Listen, whether it's drugs or booze... don't hold back tonight. I'm taking a shower. Babette! Everybody's gone. Come out or you'll melt. You okay? Still alive? Say something or I'll open the curtain. Can I have a towel? You scared me. I was afraid you'd fainted. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Can you dry my back, please? You used up all the soap! You okay? Fine. It's a mess. Everything's a big mess! But I'm fine. - You cheat on your boyfriend often? - What? Do you cheat on your boyfriend often? No, this is the first time. No, not often. Really? So I should be flattered then? I'm mostly faithful out of laziness. But for the orgasm, yeah, you can be proud. Mrs. Delbard! Cancel everything. What do I have this afternoon? Oh, shit! I'd completely forgotten our lunch. I can't. I have to pick up Julie. Come on, I'll explain. The idiot's chained to a school fence to protest the arrest of illegal aliens. I can't let the cops cart her off. Viagra? Yeah, just the kind of stuff we love hearing. Is that all the sordid details? Oh, yes... I screwed a coworker in the shower. Did I absolutely have to know that? Sorry. No harm done. Wait here, I'll go. Support the Immigrants Not the fucking Mercedes! Why'd you come? I wanna stay! Get going! Hi, Julie. I don't give a shit about a night in jail! What do you think happens to them? They ship them home like cattle! It's disgusting! And my dad drives me off in a Mercedes! They'd call me anyway. You're a minor. So? Grandpa was 17 when he joined the Resistance. At least he understands. He agrees. But all you care about is money. And fuck the rest of the world! Give me a break. Give me a fucking break! Who's there when you're up shit creek? Grandpa? He would have let me croak! - Take it easy. - You shut up! Where were you when Dad cut me off? Did you share your allowance? Did you defend me? No, you just blew me off! Enough! I'm sick of this morality shit! You piss me off! Nothing I do is ever good enough! Fuck! What? You're bleeding. Shit! Van Gogh! What came over me? I don't understand a thing. Welcome to the club. I have a jurist friend who specializes in immigration law. He says, if we act quickly, given the age difference and her Mafioso country, we could easily prove a rigged marriage. Tatiana will never get her papers. What are you talking about? A little visit to the precinct is all it takes. A little visit? Are you talking about denouncing them? Arnaud, are you kidding? - Can you see us denouncing anyone? - Of course not. I just say that so you know the leeway we have. But denouncing someone isn't leeway. It's... It's just filthy. You know... what you said before... Well, it's true. I didn't defend you at the time. I didn't even think to question Dad's decision. And to be completely honest, maybe I was even happy. To be the good girl, the good student... I don't know. Pretty lousy, huh? Really lousy. What are you doing? We're having dinner at my parent's. - Tonight? - Yes! It's been planned for weeks. Hurry, we're due there at 8 o'clock. Rémi... I'm not going. I don't feel like it. I've had enough of all that shit, of bullshitting myself... Let's take a break. A break? Yeah, let's take a break. I need to... to be alone, to get my bearings. To be alone and think. Can't we talk this over after dinner? No, I have to think now. I need to be alone right away. Wouldn't you rather go to my place? Or a hotel? Why? We're fine here. - How many slices of toast? - Four. You still sulking? You're burning up. Look at me. You can't go to the office. But I'm swamped with work. Go back to bed. I'll call Mrs. Delbard. - Where could I have caught this? - At your dad's? That old egotist does this to you. He's not at all an old egotist. Gimme a break. All he wanted in life was to be useful and to bring about progress. And never paid attention to those around him. Let's just say he had a vision. Not necessarily a more abstract vision, but a broader one. He was impossible to live with but he certainly wasn't an egotist. Can I make you something to eat? No, thanks. No way. That's sweet of you. How are you? Not great. I don't work for your dad anymore. How's that? The Moldovan fired me. After 16 years! Can you believe it? Did he agree? He didn't make a peep in front of her. I'll see about that right now. If he answers, you're luckier than I am. The machine. Hello, this is Arnaud. Can you call me back please, Dad? Thanks. Shouldn't he be home now? And you can bet he won't call back. The Moldovan fired you? I'd like you to call Grandpa for me. He won't answer me. I'm really worried. I don't work for the KGB! Okay, but what do I say? Say you'd like her to come over and play. Cool! She's right. Use your cell phone. Hi, Sorina, it's Simon. Then ask her to put your grandfather on. You hear? Ask to speak to your grandfather. She's not allowed to talk to me. Why can't she talk to me? First of all, let's not dramatize things. That's because you don't understand. He's okay, don't panic. It's not serious. It wasn't a heart attack. - Can we see him? - He's sleeping in there. - Aren't you coming? - I'll be right in. Dad. Dad, how do you feel? Fine, fine... Hello, Dad. It's nice of you to come. You scared us. What happened? It was nothing. A dizzy spell. Good thing Tatiana was there. She called the medics. Dad, I've seen your test results. What's this Digitalcardio overdose? You know not to fool around with your medications. It's nothing. Tatiana goofed when she filled my pill box. She fills your pill box? It was a mistake, that's all. It could happen to anyone. I'll be right back. Can I have a little water? Wait one second, you! Over here! What's wrong with you? - Hey, mister! - Butt out! You listen to me carefully! If you ever touch his medication again, if he has the slightest problem - you hear me? - you can forget your papers. They'll put you away for 20 years! You can count on me for that. You're out of your mind! Let me go! Let me go. Bitch! What are you doing, Dad? What have you gotten yourself into? My last fling. I've still got the right to that. Even if you don't like it. You almost had a heart attack for a girl you pay, a girl who's with you because she has no choice. Is that really what you want? How can you talk to me like that? You belittle everything. I forbid you to talk like that. Somebody has to tell you, Dad. You have to hear it. It'll end badly. You're already in the hospital. Things will only get more and more sordid. I'm sorry, Dad, but... if you go on like this, there's no chance things'll work out for you. You'll never understand anything. Leave me alone! Where were you? How is he? He'll be okay. They'll hold him for observation for a few days. We don't really know what happened to him. It's crystal clear to me. Tatiana itching to get her inheritance, that's all. Listen... we can't leap into that kind of wild speculation. There's no proof of that in his medical records. I know what I'm talking about. I'm sure of it. We have to stop her. Now. That's not up to us. He's my father. I don't want him to die. Hi, Grandpa! How are you? You look good! I brought Mr. Dembélé's file. His boss wants to hire him officially but... She didn't call today. That's not nice. It's not nice. Who? Tatiana? Shall I leave you the file to look at later? Remember your grandmother? Suzanne would never leave me all alone without calling. Your grandmother loved me very much. She loved you, too. But now, here I am. All alone. When did Arnaud say they'd get here? At 11:30. Where'd they hide the coffee? Babette, look at these! - What are they? - From his bank. It's all going down the tubes! You have to do something. It's making Arnaud sick. Oh, you're here? We brought you a few meals so you could rest up. Hi. Isn't Tatiana here? No. She must have gone to work. Strange. She didn't call yesterday. Did she leave me a note? I didn't see one. Nothing? Are you sure? - You'd tell me? - Of course. Want some coffee? No. If you're always here, she'll never come back! I've had it! I can't take it anymore! Let him treat you like that, if you like. But not me. Karine! - Where are you going? - To lunch with Tatiana. You just got out of the hospital! I feel fine. You just got here. Sit down. I'll make coffee. No coffee. I'm on my way! Dad! Dad, please. You'll kill yourself, if you keep this up. I can't bear to see you just blow everything. Please, stop. Go back to how you used to be. Do you hear me? - Stop all this, Dad. - I can't. I'd like to. I'd like to stop but... I can't. Where are you? What? What's come over you? You've lost your mind! - She hung up. - What's going on? She's on her way to the police. To Immigration. Quick! Call her back! She's on voicemail. It's this way. What are you doing? You can't do this. Listen, I know what I'm doing. I'll do the dirty work. Your hands stay clean, your ethics pristine. Ethics? We're denouncing her. We're collaborators! Stop, Babette. Wait one second. You can't speak to Karine like that! Could you live with that filth? With that on your conscience? And your conscience? If we don't try to save his life? If he goes on like this, he'll die. You don't agree with her? Arnaud, he's made his choice. It's Tatiana, not us. We have to accept that. He's not your hero anymore. He's an old man. He's losing his marbles. He's disappointed us, so you let him croak? Is that how you love, Babette? You really wanna do this? No. But I think we have to. Miss... Wait, Miss! Can you give me a few moments? Sorina and I have plane tickets to Chisinau. We leave tomorrow. You and your sister won. Happy? Not particularly. We just wanted to protect our father. Why would I kill Lucien? You have to live together 5 years before you get your papers here. Didn't you know that, Mr. Big Shot Lawyer? I don't know what you're talking about. Still, it stands to reason you should be compensated. Am I supposed to thank you now? Don't bother. Simon, you're in the way. Back to square one! - Are these hers? - That's the Viagra. Will you be here much longer? What's the matter? Report Card - Sorina Kolkina You've integrated well. Keep up the good work!! Oh, shit. That's what we've done. That! What did Sorina do for us to destroy her future? What's going on? We can't do anything now. Let's go. And your father and his Moldovan? Let's just say we "normalized" the situation. How's that for an ugly word? And what's behind it's even uglier. Really? Because I'd sort of like to... normalize our situation. But, uh... You're not my only lover, you know. I know, your boyfriend. No, not him. There are others. Oh, really! Well, maybe we could try a bed anyway? A bed? Okay. Sure, we can try. Dear Simon, How are you? I'm okay. I'd really like to see you again. Here's my address... Sorina - Hi, Aunt Hélène. - Did you have a good trip? Very good. - How's the old man? - Not bad. A big grouch, of course. But not bad. Thank you, sir. - I'm glad to see you. - Me, too. No, I don't want any ginger green tea! It's me, Dad. It's really beautiful here. It's not bad. If you like seagulls and artichokes. The old bag's gone vegetarian. She doesn't even eat dairy anymore. At her age... Soon she'll break her hip and that'll be the end of that. You all really think I'm an old geezer. Are you working a little? No, I don't have the time. Here? Whatever I start now I won't have time to finish. But you're in great shape. I think I'm already dead but no one has the nerve to tell me. Hold on... "Was this the face that launch'd a thousand ships..." - The power of beauty. - And the folly of men. If you read the right books, you always find a certain grandeur. - How are the kids? - Fine. Things are tough with Julie at the moment. It seems I'm not the great guy she thought. Just an old jerk. No news from your sister? Well, she and Rémi... They broke up. Really? She doesn't seem to be taking it badly. Would you like some tea? I'd love some. Do you have any green tea? Yes. You wouldn't have ginger, by chance? I certainly do! You won't act so smart when you have to drink it. If you stay for dinner, you'll even be treated to seaweed bread. I thought I'd stay the weekend. Really? Fine. Subtitles by Rosemary Ricchio Subtitling: C.M.C. - Paris
