I saw this dog that was hit by a car. She was killed. Her puppy was right next to her drinking her milk. The mother still had milk. The puppy was hungry. She was drinking milk and crying. What did you do with her? Did you save her? Shakib, I'll do it myself. Hey man. - Hello. How are you? - Not bad. My old man says hi and asks if you have any rat poison. I don’t sell any of that. - You know of a place that does? What do you want it for? - To kill rats! Tell your old man to come in himself. That place is beneath you. It doesn't suit you to go there. I don’t go that often. Once is too many. You shouldn't be sleeping with strangers. I'm only with one person. What did you say? - I'm only with one girl. It doesn’t matter if it’s one or ten. That place is disgusting. You shouldn’t set foot there. I’m careful. You’re not from around here. Trust me. This is a small town. If people find out, they’ll set that place on fire. They'll raise hell. I left you the keys. I could've washed those at home. - I'll wash them. Anything else? - No. We want 10 workers. 10! Only 10 workers! Sir, only 10! That’s enough. 10! 300,000 Tomans a day. Come on up. Get in. Get in. It’s only 300,000 Tomans. Haji, it’s a problem. No, the other guy. He threatened them with a knife and said he won’t pay. Watch it! Hello? Anyways, handle this. Where you going? The truck is that way. What’s your name? - Shakib. Come back tomorrow at 6am. Go get in the truck already. Take that side. Hold it. This way. Hold it. Turn it. Take this wire. Pass it through. Go forward. Pull it. Do your job. Be careful. Wait. Be careful sir. Pull it. Lift it up sir. It’s too heavy sir. Lift it up. Tomorrow, be here at the same time. Here you go. God bless you. Where is the car? - The car is over there. Here. Be on your way. Sir, Should I come back tomorrow? Where do you live? At a friend’s shop. You don’t have a home? No. What about wife and kids? - No. They died in the earthquake. God bless them. Hassan? - Yes sir? You have any problems with staying overnight? Yes sir? Show Mr. Shakib around. We don't need your cousin anymore. But sir, he’s already on his way. - You’ve been saying that for three days. What do I have him do sir? - Whatever you wanted your cousin to do. Forget it! I’ll do everything myself. - You wanted an extra hand this whole week. I do. But… That poor guy is already on his way. - He can turn around. Mr. Shakib, it’s a tough job. You have to work hard. Help out in the kitchen by day and stand guard on the set by night. You can’t have any guests over. Come and pay us already! - Ok, wait a minute. No friends, no family, no nothing. They're production designers. They built everything you see here. What was your name? - Shakib. I’m Hassan. Sorry to keep you waiting. I was looking for the blanket. Come on in! So this is the place. If you need anything, I’m in the red house. Call me. What about electricity? There's no power. - Maybe later on. You have to wake up before the crew arrives. Don’t sleep in! I’ll have someone light up a fire pit, so you keep warm. You have all that space. Can’t I come over there? What difference does it make? - The red house has power. You’re not here to party, you’re a night guard. If it’s too hard, I can send you back with the shuttles. What do you say? So? Don’t be a wimp. Give me some light so I don’t fall. Give me the director’s breakfast. This has meat in it! Alireza, give me a vegetarian dish. Come with me for a second. We need your help! A little faster. Come, we need your help. Wear these. - I have my own- No, you have to wear these now. We need you on the set. Wear it, I'll explain later. Don’t look into the camera! Don’t look at the lens! Don’t laugh! Sina, pay attention! You with the long beard, go hide in the back. It’ll be over soon. Quiet please. 3.2.1. Action! Take off your clothes. Take them off. Open the door. Cut! I’m coming! It’s a cut. Stop pounding. I apologize. Be careful! Watch your step! Help them wear their clothes. I am really sorry. Watch your steps. Put them on. Hurry up. Watch where you're throwing that! - Sorry, I'll be careful. Let me help you. - No, I'll get fired. Stop what you’re doing. Come with me. Hurry up. Faster! We are waiting for you. Be careful. Don’t fall. I can’t. - Just do it. Stand over here and look that way. Ready? Face this way. Come closer! 3, 2, 1... Action! Everything looks so fake. Is this supposed to be a comedy? They know nothing about the World War! They're keeping us in the rain for this shit? Is he having a heart attack? - Is this for real? Take his uniform. His pants too! He ruined the uniform. Hurry up! Why is it so crowded here? Please, take a tea break. Which hospital? - Soroush. Where is it? - Motahari Street. Someone has to go with him. He shouldn’t go alone. Get the car. Now that we have to repeat everything, let's ask him to do it right this time. He's messing it up. - What's wrong with it? Everything. The Gas Chamber looks ridiculous. Let's not rewrite history. Nothing looks real. You worry about getting your actor back. He won't come. - I'm sure you can bring him back. Are you even listening to me? - Just do as I say. Put him in the call sheet. - Whatever. I’m sorry sir. - What is it Shakib? Can I sleep somewhere else? - Why? The ceiling leaks when it rains. I can’t sleep. Alright, I’ll look into it. But don’t tell me these things, tell Emad. - I can sleep in the red house. Who would look after the gas chamber? - There’s nothing there. There are steel beams and film equipment. You come over here. They want him to audition. Audition? He’s not an actor. - I don't know, they want him right away. Go see what they want. Let's go. - I can't sir. Can you stop singing please? What’s your name? Tofighi. Hossein Tofighi. Not you, behind you. You sir, with the white apron. What's your name? Shakib. - Can you step forward? But sir, we'll be a laughing stock. With our prisoners and now our Hitler! He's our best option. - Let’s not rush into things. We could go over the audition tapes. Do a makeup test. I'll give it a shot. Everyone can take a break. Mr. Shakib, you come with me. Can we go home? - No, wait around here. Come with me. Listen, we are considering you for... - I can’t. What? - Take one of them- No. The director saw something in you. Let’s go. But I don’t know how- - You don’t have to know anything. I can’t. I can’t talk- - You don’t have to. You’ll do a count and we’ll dub over you later. I'll do the mustache myself. - Sure. It fits him perfectly. Take him as far back as you can. Come stand over here. Right in the middle. Let him take your picture. Let me straighten his hat. Look over here. Raise your hand! No, not like that. Like in a military salute. Raise your hand. Higher. Straight. Look over here. - Look at me. Why are you laughing? It’s for the movie. Is it that bad? Don’t laugh! Mr. Shakib, just leave it somewhere. Don't mess with anything. It’s a fragile set. If something breaks I’ll get in trouble. I didn’t want my stuff to be in the way. - It’s just a plastic bag! Use it as a pillow and take it with you when you leave in the morning. I can’t take it with me day in day out. Mr. Nosrati said that you'll only be here tonight. That’s not what he told me. That’s what he told me. Maybe talk to him again tomorrow. But it’s best if you didn’t say anything at all. He was so mad because of you, no one could go near him! Because of me? - Nosrati wanted a real actor. The director wanted you. But Nosrati has a point. It’s his money. He doesn't think you can act. - I told them I can’t, they insisted. Everyone’s always bullying everyone else. The director is bullying Nosrati and he doesn't know what to do. He thinks you’re with them. Try not to fall out of favor with him. Tell him what you just told me, you can’t act and you don’t even want to. That you want to return to the gas chamber, because you’re more comfortable there. Come up with an excuse. Tell him that the mustache makes you look ridiculous! It is ridiculous! When you walked in I laughed my ass off. Good night man! I swear we told him not to shave! Sina, didn't you tell him? You guys are not taking your jobs seriously. Get back to work! Alireza, what do you want? - They're on their way sir. Sign this. Why? - So you commit to not doing anything drastic. So you don't shave your head next. - Yes sir. I swear I’ll seek damages next time. - I didn’t know. Sign it! Sign? - You’re not signing your death sentence man! You’re signing this so you do your job right. Isn't??? The sign it. Give it to me. What sir? - The ink pad. But, what about my sleeping arrangement? I told you to stay with Hassan. - He said I could only stay for one night. You told him that? - I didn’t! You said he’ll come over, I said sure. But who will look after the gas chamber? - I can't be there. It rains and the ceiling leaks. Then you stay at Hitler’s, and you go down to the chamber. Why me? Mr. Nosrati I’ve done everything - Get back to work! Cut! Don’t shoot. Shakib, didn't I tell you to slap them hard? - I did. Harder! It’s the tenth take already! - What was his name? Shakib. - Tell him to come over here. Go see what he says. Listen to what he has to say. Everyone stay in your spots. We’ll do another take. Come here. I want to be alone with him for a second. Do you know who Hitler was? - Yes. Who was he? Forget it. Do you know who the guy you're slapping is? No. - Close your eyes. Close them. Now pretend you're living with someone you love. And you have a kid that you’re willing to die for. Nothing in the world is worth more to you than these two. And then one day, you come home to play with your kid, And you find that these people have cut them into pieces. What would you have done? Is this how you would’ve slapped them? I wouldn’t have slapped them. They gave me this mansion. They told me... Not to do manual labor anymore. I spend the nights here. 1, 2, 3 Why are you crying? Where are you? The asshole wanted to drug me with a syringe. So I don’t feel the pain and work for him like a dog. I can’t anymore. Slightest odors make me want to throw up. I’ll take you back and talk to him. - I won’t go back. Where do you want to go? I don’t know. - You can’t sleep in the streets. Let me stay with you for a few days. With me? I don't have a place. In that house that you’re in. - It's not possible. It is so crowded over there, they'll see you. For only three or four days. - I can't. If he doesn’t find me, after a few days he’ll give up. Then I’ll leave town. If you want to leave town, leave today! What's the difference? Don't be such a baby! Everybody is staring. Sit down - I don't care Every day a hundred men want me for only one thing... Where is it? - What? They're leaving. Run when I tell you. Got it? Everyone’s gone. No one is here. What a nice house! - Is it nice? It suits you. Shakib? Mr. Shakib! I’m coming. Shakib, where are you? - I’m here. Why weren’t you opening the door? Were you playing the keyboard? - No. Don’t use it, you’ll break it. It’s cold here too. How could you stay over there? There's water everywhere. I’ll spend the nights here from now on. You go over there. It’s more comfortable on that couch. Are you serious? - I sleep here, even when you’re not around. Are you sure? - Positive. Thanks man! It’s so cold! I’ll make my bed. Don’t move. He will spend the night here. Was it nice? - What was? The song that you played. Cut. You're all supposed to be dead over there. Use your brains. Don't move. Mr. Shakib, you're ruining the uniform. Sit on the chair. Get some tea for Shakib! You abandoned your post last night! - It was raining. You can quit if you don't like it. Just leave Shakib alone. Excuse me, sir. Is Hassan upset with me? - No, why? Because he's acting strange. You did the right thing. From now on, tell me everything. Only because you had asked me to. - I said you did the right thing. Are you done for today? - Yes. Are you watching over the house? - Yes. Shakib, are you taking that for the dog? Yes. - Take this too. Thanks. You can't stay here anymore. They'll find you. Can’t you tell them that your wife will stay with you? They asked me if I have a family. I said no. Tell them now that you have a job your wife is back. What about my kid? Where is my kid? Wherever. They’re not going to ask. I told them that my wife and kid are dead. Can’t you say you remarried? Remarried in the last 3 days? They'll fire me. I committed to not having any guests over. Just admit that you’re too embarrassed to show me to them. I found a place. Where? Underneath here? - Don't worry. I'll take you out when they leave. Mr. Shakib. Mr. Shakib! Mr. Shakib! Yes? - Open the door for a second. Yes? - Two people are here to see you. Shakib, get it over with and come and see me. - Thank you sir. Hello. - Hello. You’re Shakib? - Yes. I am Farshid. Do you know me? I know Rahim. - You’re a client, aren’t you? Can we go talk over there? Why? - I work here. I told that guy too. That we’re friends. We’re not here to cause trouble. You live in that red house? It’s a film set. What kind of a film are they making here? - I don't know. When’s the last time you saw Ladan? - Ladan? When did you talk to her last? - Three days ago. On the phone? - On the phone. How? - Video call. You know how to talk to her? - Yes. How do you know that? - My mother was deaf and mute. Say something. What should I say? Anything. I want to see if you really know sign language. Does he know? Who are you calling a cunt? You piece of shit. Give him a straight answer! You hear me? A straight answer! Don’t make a scene- - You know what he said? Whatever. He said it to me. You better watch out. Quiet. It’s his place of work! Don’t make a scene. That’s not what I said. It doesn’t matter. When was the last time again? The last time I was over. When is that? Rahim was there. You mean you haven’t seen her since? Are you sure? Alright. Go get the bike. Go. Go. I’m sorry, he’s a little nuts. Just do us a favor. Keep us posted. Tell her Farshid wants to see you. Alright? Thanks. Bye. What is it? Farshid found us! They’re here? - Did you tell Farshid about me? How did he find me? - Maybe Shirin told him something. Why did you tell her? We'll go to the terminal tonight. - Why? He suspects that you're here. He'll come back. I will hide in the crawl space. It makes no difference, if he comes back, he will find you. How can he find out that I’m here? Unless you tell him. We'll go to the terminal tonight. Pin code? - 2003. Go to the door to get on the bus. Only a ticket to Tehran was available. - It doesn’t make a difference. Why did you lie to us? Didn’t you say she’s not here? Where you going? I won’t hurt you. You fell in love with her? What did you do with your money? - I don't have any. Why is she here? Get up! Get up! What’s she doing here? What were you planning? Did you help her escape? - I didn’t know she escaped. Get up! Get up! No whining. Did you help her escape? - I didn’t. Then who did? - She was scared. Scared of who? Scared of what? I raised her! Why would she be scared of me? I don't know. Why would she be scared? Why?! Come stand over here. Right here. Good job. Stand right here. If you don’t know, then who does? - Ask her. I want to ask you. She said you wanted to drug her. - What drugs? I wanted to force you to take drugs? Why would I do that? Is that really what you told him? Rahim, we wanted to drug her? How many hours she's been here? - About 40 hours sir. 10 million for being an asshole. 30 for me not beating her senseless. And 30 for not hanging you by the balls. What's the total? He owes you at least 150. - I don’t have it. Why did you bring her here then? Why don’t you have it? Grab her and let’s go. - Don't take her. Want her to stay? 150 million. Should she stay? I can’t pay that much. - How much do you have? How’s 120? 100? Will you leave her alone if I pay? - I swear I will. Give me a 100 tomorrow morning and keep her. - I can’t by tomorrow morning. I can’t by tomorrow morning. - You can. Who would I get it from? - I don’t give a shit. Steal if you have to. You should’ve thought of that before. What’re we going to do now? - Give me some time. I’ll come up with it. Give me a day. You’re getting on my nerves. Tomorrow morning is only 8 hours away. Who could I get it from? Alright. We’re friends. We’re buddies. The day after tomorrow, you will bring me a 100 million. If you don’t, I will no longer be so civil. I’ll take her with me tonight- - Let her stay here. I'll come up with the money. - To hell with it. She can stay. You will bring me a 100 million. Let’s go Rahim. I'm watching you. Let me go. No one is forcing you to ruin your life because of me. You’ve already done more than anyone else. But I feel like we’re playing a game. We’re fooling ourselves. I will go back tonight. The money... I will come up with it. What if you couldn’t? We will run away together. Cut! Cut! Was that good sir? - Ms. Zareh. Okay. - Okay! Let’s set up the next shot. What is it Mr. Shakib? - When will the shoot be over? The shoot? Why do you want to know? We have 3-4 months left I can’t. You’ll be done much sooner. We have 3-4 months left I can’t anymore. You can’t anymore? - I have to go. What do you mean you can’t? You have to. You can’t just leave in the middle of a job. - I have to leave. Did someone say something? - My mother needs money for an operation. She’s being hospitalized tomorrow. How much do you need? - 100 million. 100? - 100. You can’t come up with a 100 million on your own, can you? I’ll do my best. I’m sorry. I didn’t want to put you in this position. Is this a new game you’re playing Shakib? - My mother is dying. It’s not a game. Didn’t you tell me you have no one? - I said I don’t have a wife and kids. What was Hassan saying anyways? - What did he say? Who were the people who came over last night? Weren’t they the ones who were here yesterday? - Yes sir. What do they want? You owe them money? - No. They’re my cousins. They came to tell me that my mother is sick. Your family doesn't believe in phones? - I didn’t have reception. Does 10 million do the job? - No. I need 100 million. Shakib, you can’t just ask for that the second you realize we need you. You’re literally bribing me now. - You don’t owe me anything. Ms. Zareh didn’t let me leave. If you go, the production will come to a halt. - If I don’t, my mother will die. Come sign this. - What is it? Sign it so I can give you the money. We owe you nothing for acting or guarding after this. You’ll give me all of the money? - Sign it and I will. This is only 10 million. - Were you expecting a 100? I need a hundred million. I have to leave if I don’t have that. That’s not my problem. Be thankful that I didn’t charge you for damages to props. Where you going Shakib? - To raise the money. I’ve already spent more than 20 billion on this film. I’m in debt and I don’t take shit from anyone. You leave, I'll send you behind bars. You’ve spent that much money and you’re worried about this amount? You know what worries me? The fact that I’ve sold my house and invested it in this film. That Rastegar overlooked all these real actors and gave a nobody like you this part. That’s what worries me Mr. Shakib. I already know the film will not make its money back. And this is the appreciation you show? What can I do? You tell me. Show me a way. Go get things started with the 10 I gave you. I’ll give you the rest later. Here. - When? I will. Once things clear up a bit I will pay the rest. It's for an operation, add something to it. Did you get it? 20 million now... 80 million later. Farshid won’t budge. I'll give him this check and ask for more time. When they pay me the rest, we can run away together. Let’s just run away with this 20 million. Wait a few more days. I'll get paid when I'm done with my job. Then we run away together. 1, 2, 3, 4. Rest assured. No one will come. Are you sure no one's around? - Everyone is gone. Hassan is gone too. Do you like it? I’ll wait for you outside. Sell this and add it to the money. I thought they are all fake! Only this one is gold. The rest are fake. Keep this for later. I lied to you. Farshid didn't want to drug me. Why did you lie then? I wanted to be with you. With me? Or that house? That house. That’s what I wanted at first. But not anymore. Now, what do you want? You. You and that house. And a baby! Don't you want that? I... had it... all. I don't want it anymore. Why? I can't take good care of them. You've taken good care of me. I was pregnant once. But I never gave birth. It would've been nice to see what the baby looked like. My son looked so much like me. He would call me "Bib" instead of "Shakib". Bib! When we leave this place, let’s first go to your hometown. Pay them a visit. I can't. My brother-in-laws don't let me anywhere near their gravestones. Someone had told them... That Shakib... Ran away when the earthquake hit... And did not save his wife and kid. I was at work. I didn't run away. I wasn't even home. But I want a baby. Two of them. Four! If I didn't get home by noon. Go to the Police. You’ll be back. All Farshid cares about is money. You have some cash with you? - Yeah. Can you buy some sweets on your way back? Hassan, where are you? Mohammad, hurry up! - I’m on my way sir. I have to go sir. I have something to do. - Hurry up. We have a lot to do today. You have to stick around. My mother is sick. I had already told them. Who did you tell? - I told Mr Nosrati. At first you barely talked and now you go around me to Nosrati. Hello Mr. Rahim. I’ll be there in an hour. Yes sir. When can this check be cashed? - Today. What’s this? It’s only 20 million. - I couldn’t get more. If you give me one more week I’ll get you the rest. I’m making more omelets, want some? - You have to ask? You want some? - No. So... What now? Whatever you say. You’re right. I should’ve come up with the money. If you give me a week I will- - What’s in a week? I can’t. Show me a way. - I say come up with the rest by tomorrow. Tomorrow… Who can come up with 80 in a day? - You. I don’t have anyone to ask. How did you get the 20? Come up with the rest the same way! What if I couldn’t? - You can. Stay positive. Give me at least 3 days. Where's the omelette? No thanks. Take it. Thank you sir. The bus broke down. Can you push? Push it, here we go! Push it! I can't do this. Call a mechanic. What’s the black smoke? It’s that film shoot. They'll burn the jungle down! Can you not sit on the floor with your uniform? I just ironed it. Can I use your phone to make a call? - Yeah. Sure. Here you go. Akbar. Akbar. What? - The power is out again. Wait a minute. Is it back on? - No. It’s back on. What did you do? Shakib! Mr. Shakib! Ms. Zareh! No sir. I wasn’t even there. As soon as I got there, we rushed him here. They’re stitching him up. There’s only one health clinic in town, you won’t miss it. Mr. Shakib. Are you feeling better? What got into you this morning? Did someone say something to you? Is your mother feeling better? Tell me if something has happned. Neda, step out please. I said step out. Sir, can you give us a minute? What’s gotten into you Shakib? You've upset everyone. I had nothing to do with everyone. - You didn’t? You’re kidding me? Suicide may be nothing to you, but people lose their shit when they see blood. The makeup room looks like a slaughterhouse. You killed someone and I’m the one who turned it into a slaughterhouse? We killed someone? Who did we kill? Someone was in that house. - When? Who was in the house? When you blew the house up, someone was inside. That’s enough. Your stitches will come off. Just tell me where she was. Shakib, that’s enough! Tell me where she was. Down here. - Down here where? Show me exactly. Right here. This is not something you and I could do. We need heavy duty machinery. I’m talking to you. Let’s go! We’ll come back in the morning. We can’t. They’ll come after her in the morning. Who will come after her? Didn’t you say no one knows? The people I paid to keep from coming after her. Shakib, what have you done? Who was this girl? Please, come search for her. - You’ve ruined my life. My life has gone up in flames. - Your life has?! You fucking asshole, is your life in ruins or mine? Is your future up in flames or mine? No one even knows you! Who will be held responsible? You or me?! You will return to your goddamn doghouse, And live your shitty life until you drop dead. It’s my life that’s on the line here. I’ll go to the police. - Over my dead body. I swear to God I will pour gas on you and set you on fire. I fucking will. You’ll do as I say. You’ll go back to the hotel We’ll come in the morning and we’ll look for her. If we find her, we'll go to the police and we’ll cancel the shoot. But if we don't find her here, you'll get back to work and finish your goddamn job. Can I have a room? - A small one or a big one? It doesn’t matter. Take him and make sure he has everything he needs. Have a PA watch over him. Where were you? - Don't worry about it. Hurry up! Shakib, are you feeling better? - Yes. He’s better than both of us. Let’s go. Shakib, tell them if you need something. Check in on him every two minutes. Is Rastegar still in his room? - I think so. Emad, get back to work. Sina. Will you spend the night here? - Yes sir. Open the door. Open it already. I need some time alone with Shakib. Close the door. What's that guy’s name? - Farshid. What’s his address? Why do you want it? So I can pay him off and beg him to not show up on the set tomorrow. Why are you staring at me? Tell me already. Mr. Shakib, do you need anything? Mr. Shakib, are you alright? Mr. Shakib, get in the car. - Shakib, come here. What are they doing? - They’re searching, what else? Why didn’t they tell us? - What difference does it make? What was that truck’s load? - The big pieces of burnt wood. How long have they been searching? - It’s been a few hours. Shakib. Shakib! Shakib, wait a minute! What’re you doing? Wait! - You think I’m an idiot? Last night you said we’ll come and search together. I brought in excavators. They went through the whole place. She’s not here. She must’ve escaped. - How are you so sure? We just got here! I’ve been in touch with Hassan. - How're you so sure? Listen to me. - What are you doing? Get out. Get off! Go away! - What the hell are you doing? Don't touch his face! We need it for the shoot. You assholes. - Let go of him. Emad! Let him go! Please stop! What’s wrong with you boy?! Are you mental?! Why are you doing this? Ask him why he cleared this place up? Ask him why he cleared this place up? - I told him to. What’s it got to do with him? It’s absurd! You want me to not grab my shot because you want to say goodbye to the remains of the house? Someone died here. Did you know that? Someone was burned in this house, did you know that? You all burned her alive, all of you! When did we ever disrespect you that you You never respected me. Having us dead or alive doesn’t make a difference to you No one cares if we're dead or alive. Why wouldn't we care? - Then how come no one does anything? Someone has died in there. Couldn’t they hear all of us shouting? - She was deaf. She couldn’t hear. Where’s the corpse right now then? - The corpse has a name. She was a human being. So where is she right now? - Ask him. You son-of-a-bitch. You want me to tell on you?! What is he talking about? You knew about this? - Of course I did. Last night he brought me here to search for a non-existent body. I knew he was lying to rip me off again but I agreed to help him. I haven’t slept all night I brought all these people here to search for her. So what happened? Did you find something? - Are you out of your mind? Of course not! He cleared everything up to cover it up. Shut your mouth asshole! He has cleared everything up. He said we’ll come and search together. Didn't we? - He wants you to believe no one was here. I asked Hassan to tell me if he found something. Didn’t you say we shouldn't tell anyone? I only said shut your mouth until we actually find a body. I’m not a murderer. I wouldn’t keep quiet if I saw a body. Couldn't you have him do the search himself? - He’s suicidal! I was worried. Why did you clear this place up? Didn’t we have a scene to shoot here? He told me to and I did. - Who told you? It’s my job. No one else’s. Neda, don’t talk to me like that. Rastegar told me to. Mr. Rastegar, you told him to clear this place out? Didn’t we have a scene here? Mr. Shakib. You have ruined the film! First you tried to kill yourself with a pair of scissors. The crew has been on the edge ever since. Everyone is sick to their stomach because of you. And now you’re lying and making wild accusations? Just because I’m illiterate and you grabbed me off the streets doesn’t mean everything I say is a lie. You want me to tell them what you were really up to in that house? A bunch of random ass people would come and go. Shakib, did you know someone was here? She was hiding here, because she was afraid. Why didn’t you send her away? No one bothered to tell me they're blowing up the house. He’s full of shit. Everybody knew! Weren’t you there when we were moving in the gas canisters? You were helping us. Didn’t I tell you it’s the explosion. - You’re lying. Stop! Stop! Fine, he didn’t know. What about afterwards? Weren’t you here when the house was on fire? Why didn’t you say anything then? Are you also a mute who can’t talk?! I was in shock. I swear I will kill him. Let go of him. Tell him to dump his load. I told you to stop. Tell him to dump it. Just let him go through it to make sure! - Dump it! Mr. Shakib you looked everywhere. She’s not here. Come over here. That’s enough. Turn off the engine. Turn it off. What’re you doing? Come over here. Shakib! Have the other dump trucks come back. - Trucks? It’s just this one and the one that left. It must’ve been at least 20 truck loads. Come over here. You’re killing him! Get off! Start the car! I’ll take him to the clinic. Let’s go. I won’t come to the clinic. - It’s not up to you. You’re bleeding. Where’s Nosrati? - What do you want? You want to beat him up again? Your people are the ones who beat me up. - Of course. You hit their friends and they came to defend them. Everyone who walked by me, kicked me. It’s easier for you to beat me than to listen to me.. Why should there even be a fight? You have a problem, go to the police. Mr. Shakib. Sometimes being alone gets to us. Are you sure someone was there with you? Saeed? Not right now. He’s bleeding. I'm taking him to the clinic. I won’t come to the clinic. - What? How did you know? Okay. Let’s go to the hotel. Nosrati says he has news from that girl. Look at what you’ve done to yourself and this goddamn project. Nosrati, give him a call. Who are you calling? Yeah? - How’re you Mr. Farshid? I’m all right. - Can you talk? I want to talk about that girl, Ladan. Go ahead. - Can you repeat the things you told me? I already told you everything. I’m sorry bro. I need you to tell me one more time. She’s back. - You mean she’s over there right now? I don’t have to explain anything to you. - Can you tell me when she got back? You asked me to tell you when she’s back and I did. It doesn’t mean you get to call me to ask follow-up questions. Thanks man. See Shakib. He says she’s back. Shakib! He’s not feeling well, we have to take him to the hospital. Get some water. Shakib. Hurry up! Drink some water. Shakib, why do you think I’m your sworn enemy? I swear I feel for you man. You have no idea what awaits you after this film. You let a bunch of animals take you for a ride. Who was that? What’s his relationship to her? He knows. I know their type. They’re only after money. This girl grew up with them. They were a gang who tried to screw you over. You think a runaway girl and a guy who makes money with her can be compassionate? If she really loved you, why didn’t she leave him before? Why did she run away the second she learned you’re acting in a movie? Because they knew you will be famous soon and you still don't. She saw the house and thought she hit the jackpot. She didn’t know it was a set. She told that guy and they came to screw you over. How much did you pay Farshid? - 80 million. If she’s back, why did you pay him? I paid him last night. He called me just now to say that she's back. You paid him to forget about Ladan. Otherwise you would’ve gotten your money back. I can’t get my money back from that vulture! Think before you speak! Where did you bury her? - God damn it, he’s in a different universe! Saeed, tell me if something has happened. I won’t back down until you tell me where she is. - You won’t back down?! Do I have to remind you who you were? - I was a nobody and I’m still a nobody. Were you a nobody? Then make the decision to become a somebody. Instead of bumming around the brothels, try to build a life for yourself. I thought someone was really dead Mr. Shakib. I now realize that you don’t have what it takes to do this job. I was wrong about you. Nosrati, let’s wrap his scenes and then send him off to do whatever he wants. Yes, sir. I don’t want to work anymore. Truth is, I don’t want to work with you anymore either but we have no choice but to continue. So finish your job or else there will be consequences. Don’t threaten me. I’m not afraid of anything. I have nothing more to lose. You never had anything. Don’t talk as if we took anything away from you. I wouldn’t even be talking to you if I wasn’t stuck in the middle of my film. You have no choice but to finish the job. Who are you to tell me what I have to do? I’m the guy who put clothes on your back. Immortalized you. I’m that guy! Set foot outside of here... - Mr. Rastegar, wait a second - ...and I’ll use your contract to put you behind bars. He should be in the hospital, not here where you can threaten him. Saeed, tell me if you’ve done something wrong. - Oh God! What’re you blabbering about with that nonsense? What kind of language is that? What’re you suggesting with “something wrong?!" - Did I say you’ve done something wrong? I was talking to Saeed. Why did you take it personally? Are you also in on this? - What do you mean? It’s clear what I mean. How is it that we were planning on shooting such an important scene You insisted that we fence off the rubble so not even a cat can get through and then you tell Saeed to go clear everything out?! You think you’re a grownup now and can question me?! What are you hiding? Saeed doesn’t lift a finger without your permission. You're making a movie at what cost? - It’s my fault for giving nobodies like you a chance. Get your things and go back to Tehran. I don’t want to see you again. You'll never amount to much in life. I would rather stay a nobody than to turn into someone like you. Saeed, don’t worry if Shakib doesn't come back. Rastegar can play that role just fine. He'll fit right in. I’ll wait for Shakib to go see if this girl is there or not. If she’s there, great. If not, I will personally go to the police. What’re you doing? Get down from there. Where are they? - I don’t know where they are. They suddenly moved out. Shakib, come here. Do you know him? - He’s a friend. Thanks. Tell Ladan to come here. - Hop on. Tell Ladan to come before I shout- - Don’t you want to go see Ladan? Hop on. Hop on! Come. You brought me here to kill me. You’re the one getting us killed. Just forget about it. You threaten us in the neighborhood? - Didn’t you say she’s back? Where is she? Forget what I said. She’s not with me. I don’t know where in hell she is. She ran away and came to you. And now she's at some other shithole. - You bastard. Call me whatever you want, but hear me out. Nosrati came over with that director and some well-connected guy and threatened me. I swear they turned my life upside down. I had to move out of that place. If they turn me in I’ll get executed. He’ll get executed. Whoever has set foot in that house will get fucked. Including yourself. You helped that girl run away and then you killed her. I killed her? - Then who killed her? What if I tell the police she was my wife? - You asshole A temporary marriage with him as my witness. Should I claim that you kidnapped my wife? Just forget about it Shakib. Don’t make things any worse. Ladan has been with me since she was a kid. She has no parents, no nobody. When I say she’s not around, it means she’s not. When you insist that she is, she comes back to life. They’ll come looking for her, they’ll ask who was she, what was she, where was she?! I'm going to the police station. - Who is this guy?! Shakib! Shakib! Hey man! If you’re going to the police station, take your contract with you. Here. You’ve committed to do your job or else pay me for damages. Do you have 23 billion tomans or should I send you to jail? You’ve killed someone and you’re discussing money? We’re saying she wasn’t there, you’re the one who insists that she was! Fine. Let’s go to the station and see whose word they believe. - Your word over mine. You’re more powerful. No man. It’s not about power. It’s about the law. You lied. You were hiding someone there. And then the day of the fire you came up with an excuse and ran away. An excuse? - Yes. An excuse. You lied to me too. You told me you wanted money for your sick mother. My lawyer looked into it and learned that your mother died 12 years ago. Plus you’re claiming that no one told you we were burning the house down... 63 people have signed a statement saying that you knew. This is the whole crew. All of them. My final word. Either you come back in to work or I will press charges. How many of them were there? Many. You mean you were just walking in the street and suddenly a hundred people attacked you?! Did you get into a fight over that girl? Shakib... You can’t find a life partner from a brothel. You’re destroying yourself with your own hands. Are you there? - Yes. Javad? - I'm coming. What happened Mr. Shakib? Did you see her? - I did. Wait. Was she really there? Or are you saying that because you’re afraid of them? I said I saw her, didn’t I? I don't know the language. - Trim it more. I don't know Arabic. - Shorter. Just do a count and they’ll dub over it. - But I don't look like Saddam at all. Sina. Sina! - It doesn't matter. Mr. Shakib is here. - Come here Shakib. Sit down right here. Sir, can you come here please? How long does it take? - Once we're done with Hitler, your chapter begins. Cut. That was good. Set up the next shot. Let's take a break, one last scene and then you’re done. Please go to the gas chamber. Thanks. Yes dear? What is it? - I would like to return this bracelet to its owner. Give that to the costume department. Do you know if this is gold? - I have no idea. Where did you find this? - In the rubble of the house, when I was working there. I want to know if this is gold or not. I found it in the rubble. Help. Help us! Open the door! Sepideh? - Yeah? Is Shakib over there? - Yes, he’s here. Did we break for lunch? - Yeah you can go too. This guy wants to see you, don’t meet up with any more strangers here. Here you go sir. - Thanks. This is the thanks I get? How could you betray me? Were you always a thief? Only you knew I keep the poison in that safe. Why did you steal it? You son-of-a-bitch I’m responsible for every ounce of that thing. A pinch of it would kill hundreds of people. Empty your pockets! I said empty your pockets! Hurry! I said empty your pockets! Hurry! Oh dear God! This is empty! Who did you give all this poison to? Shakib, my whole body is shaking. Did you kill someone? Do you have a problem with them? Bastard! Bastard! Someone open the door! Help! Get some water. Water! Water! Why did she fall too? She's throwing up blood. Someone call for help. What's happening? Help! I don't know. They're throwing up blood. Who was the cook? Help us.
