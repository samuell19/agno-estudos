Why didn't you tell? Because you're afraid of Dave? Or because you fancy my baby sister Saffra? You see, she's not really my sister, you know. Her daddy is my daddy, but her mother is not my Ma. I slept in the same bed as her once. Gave me a real stiff, man. You get a real stiff? Hey! This boy want to know if I's the decorator. The boy say he got a receipt. Let's see that thing now. Signed by the landlord, Samuel Benjamin Ignatius Jones. Boy, you are dream! Wake up before the blood go to my head and me get mad. Me and me wife and me children been living here for eight years. Cha! Take a walk now, boy. - (KNOCKING) - What the... Who the fuck is that disturbing we? Boy got company? (LAUGHING) Bumba hole. Why you always turn up at the real wrong minute? I was just going to steam the chick. Anyway, what you doing here this time of night? Well, you say a mattress on the floor. Shift, boy. I have a woman in there ready to dance to the music. I was just going to roast her crotch. You is disturbing I. Ain't you got anywhere else to go? You have any money to pay some rent? 'Cause the landlord don't like anybody owing him rent money. Besides, him don't like the overcrowding. You have any cash on you? All right. Well, he don't have nobody sleeping in the kitchen. Maybe he put a mattress on the floor for you. Just stay there, now. And listen, stay away from I man Dave privacy. You hear? Ah, so you is the noisy boy. - Where is that man Dave? - He gone upstairs. And my thing getting cold. You want a ride? It's nice and tight, for the quick time two pound. Thanks, lady, but I don't want your two pounds. All I want is a bed to sleep in tonight. Ha! Is I asking you for the two pound? What kind of stupid friend is you liming with? Is the boy who don't want to put his stick in the slime. Cha, woman, put away your pokey and wait for me. (LAUGHING) It's not the Ritz, but then we not charging the same prices. We usually do the cleaning in the mornings. Now listen, spar. This is a respectable house with respectable people, but it ain't the Salvation Army, and the landlord like his rent in advance. It's five pound he want for the night. That is what he want you to give he. Sorry I was in the way. Me grandmother says not the best manners to call round without sending a letter first. No problem. So why didn't you check out the chick? Maybe if she'd have liked you she'd do it with you for free. It's love why she do it with Dave. (DAVE CHUCKLING) If you like staying here, tomorrow I will talk to the blasted landlord. Because when I am sleeping with my Miriam and you are using my bed, no way are we going to pay for the fucking kitchen floor. Where is Miriam? Miriam, Miriam, shit. She doing her hustle down in the club. and I am doing mine here. It's a foolish man who turn down free pussy. Mmm, here she comes. A whole heap of tun tun coming your way. - It's me money me come for. - Money? Behave yourself, Mildred. Me ain't finished yet. You're joking. Listen, now, give me my money before I scream, man. Come on, baby, come on. Let's finish the business now. Hah! If you've got another score, that's cool. But me was just coming to the sweet part. Listen. brother, it's like that. Me work by the minute, not by the kackie, and time is me master. It worth a lot to me. Hah! Bollocks! Why, them raasclaat women using their pussy to enslave men, then say we enslave them. But we is fool, fool to believe them. Spar, you clean up this kitchen real good. The food smell nice, make me hungry. Soul food is good for the kackie, give you kack power. - Then bring forward the food, man. - It ain't ready yet. - Then why you eating it? - I is hungry, that's why. Cha, man, what is good for the jackass is good for the jackass cart. Make we eat now. Listen, I lose five pound because you is here, so five pound for the fuck what I never get. Man, you made me waste my energy for nothing. Money, money, money, everything in this place is for the money. Don't worry about the money, boy. Just enjoy the spending. This food taste nice. Life is going to be full of joy in this partnership of ours. You really is a good cook. With Miriam as the front person and with your talent as the chef, the three of we could go into the restaurant business. I mean, think about it, spar. The Chinaman have him chop suey, the Indian man have him his Indian food, - and what we got? - Soul food. Right on. You see like every man got to specialise. Now I specialise in collecting social welfare cheques, smoking ganja, holing pussy and spreading joy. Now that is four items. What you going contribute to make this partnership work? I don't know, banna. I just got here. Well, think about it. Me already contribute four items. You have to do the same. Well, like going to work, that's one. Bringing home the money, that's two. Looking after the domestic side, like washing up the plates when we finish eating, that's three. - Making the food. - That's four. You see, you earn the money, and I then show you how to spend it. You cook the food, and I going show you how to enjoy it. Any time you want to hole pussy, you see me, and any time I want a few pound, I going to see you. With a partnership like that, spar, we bound to score. When you is in the jungle, you need friends to help you, and here is I, Dave, holding out a helping hand to you. Touch skin. Touch soul. Seal it like that. Now sleep well, boy, and don't let the landlord catch you in the morning, or else he will step over you like all landlord does. Have a good night. Bye. DAVE: You see, what me saying, boy, is that you is either the man with the whip or the man with the scars. Is like every man got to secure him own cave in this forest. JAMAICAN: That's my seat, man. I'm not asking you, I'm telling you to remove your arse from my seat, man. Or you want me to remove you? My whole week's pay, darkie, you can't move my friend Paddy here. Oh, I can move him, but I ain't gonna dirty my hands, man. The world is changing, boy, we is all free to work, or sit on we arse. Me want more meat. You take from me, I take from you. (CHUCKLING) Partner, you learning the smooth talk to be crooked like the rest of we. That blasted rat pissing on my head again. See what me mean? Nice sauce too, boy. Hey, they're going to cut all the trees down in this street. It means him and all your mates are going to have to walk to work like everybody else. Still following me? I'm going before me grandpa has another row with me going out on a Sunday. - Pass me coat, now. - Pass the baby sister her coat, now. Let him take you home, now, see you safe. - Hands off! - Leave the country boy alone. She's made of the same stuff as me, you know. Only thing is, it's got claws in it. Thanks very much! She's just waiting for some sweet-talking boy who can afford she. I can see myself home. Go on. You don't say much. - Why? - I've got nothing important to say. Doesn't stop most of them. I'd watch out for Dave. He's going to take you. He's my friend. I don't know if you're a fool, or... - What you going to do now? - Stay. I got a home. - With Dave? - We could fix it, we could repair it. I learned to do that on the farm. - Oh, be careful, darling, he'll have you. - Uh-huh.

Child, you have no respect for your natural born mother. Me tell you no peeping now. If I can't peep on me own mother, who I gonna peep on? Now close them eyes, and shut that blooming mouth. Now, go to bed, now. How you suppose I'm gonna learn? From bloody whores? If I grow up bent, you can blame yourself. What do you think? No big thing. Nothing special. It'll be okay when I've finished with it. I'm getting my own place. Haven't decided to take it yet, 'cause it means having to share with a couple of girls. Besides, Jomo said he can help. You don't get your own bathroom. Me got one. I'm thinking of putting a shower in the kitchen. You only get single beds. That one's for me, and that one's for... The landlord, he don't allow that. You going out with me again? Me don't know. Why? 'Cause me don't have that new dress to wear. You know I had to spend the money on the flat. I want you to look the prettiest girl. Huh, I know your type. All sweet-talking innocence with the rap, getting she going, then after running away from she. I want you to have this. I want you to wear it. No promises, now.

Me mother Miriam say that is why brother Dave is gonna leave she. He's gonna marry you. - (JIMMY HELMS: "BLACK JOY") - That still the same old record. If you want to marry me baby sister Saffra, you're gonna have to buy more records than that one. She's very crazy about things like that. Do you want to see the new dress I bought she? She ain't gonna wear this rubbish. She ain't no rag doll, you know. Use your head, brother Ben. (BUBBLING) Now you try. (COUGHING) Inhale, man, inhale. - I trying. - Harder. - Try, man, try. - I trying. Then stop your trying, and suck the fucking thing. It blasting me head. (LAUGHING) That mean it working. All right, you smoke the pipe. Me have some serious business on the telephone. Go on, smoke the raasclaat pipe now. Hi, babe. This is Dave. I is feeling ni-i-i-ice. (CHUCKLING) Listen, babe, me and my spar is having a little party to baptise our new flat. Yeah. That will be cool. Honk the horn when you come, babe. (HANGING UP PHONE) (CHUCKLING) Half an hour she going be here, and you going go down and let she in. Is what you grinning at, boy? About Miri. What about Miri? She not here. Working is her hustle, and this is mine. - You love Miri? - Course me love Miri. You love Miri, but you fuck Maggie. Mmm, this how it go. Loving is a serious business, and this is fucking. Either you serious or you have the joy. Me serious about Saffra. Me dig. You think Saffra is a virgin? I think so. Cha, man, grow up. If Saffra is a virgin, me is a monk. That girl been climbing up the banana tree since she was a child. And what is that? If that is Maggie, why she's early? Well, go and fetch her now. Me said go and fetch her now, boy. Is where you going now? I mean, must I man Dave do everything? Me bring the pussy here for you to hole, and you mean I must go downstairs and fetch it up too? (HEAVY TREADING) (LIGHTER TREADING) Benji! Me and Maggie's out here, boy, ready to enjoy ourselves. I'm going to have a wash. Why, you mean you don't want to hole somebody's saltfish, boy? Where's Maggie? You deceiving me. It's you been deceiving me, you little raasclaat. You never had no pussy. It's true that. You never sinned before. (CHUCKLING) Jesus Lord, the little country boy is as holy as a cow. Listen, you is a virgin, and she is not. If you plan to stand up and do battle with that chick, well, like me is going to have to educate you. Well, how it go? A giant, leaping with giant strides, looking at the sun. - Put in ten pence, quick. - What happen? You want to see or not? Put in ten pence now, man. And let I see the way is clear. - Remember Ben is here waiting. - Is all right. Ha ha hee! BEN: What going on in there? Be still, boy. Okay, the way is clear. Oh, God, the damn thing is black. Well, put in another ten pence before some other dude come and take the machine. BEN: Let I look. DAVE: Wait, boy. But you see these things all the time. DAVE: Yes, but I is the teacher. Oh, damn it, the frigging thing stopped when she was going to take off the drawsie. Well, then, put in another ten pence. Okay, but I want the whole look. It's all right, nothing wrong with that. Look, is that you have to take this thing in stages. Class one, class two. Is like you climb up the ladder, and you ain't ready for class three yet, boy. But you don't let me look. Is my money paying for it. If I don't see, my thirty pence is wasted. Every time he go to do it, the machine stops. Well, that is because the machine is not a fool. The machine's a businessman. If the machine sell you satisfaction, is not you going to put in more pennies. If you want to see the end you have to pay to the end. - But that is cheating. - That is the lesson. Me is teaching and you is learning. But these machines heard it all before, boy. Let's go. - Can we go in? - You see what me mean? You got the hook in your mouth already. Here we go. Now, look at that! Just how much would you sell this thing here for? CASHIER: That one there, sir, is £25.50. £25.50 for a bit of black power, and you have it all yourself. How can a man use that? He'll be like a pea in the Atlantic Ocean. He could drown himself. Is not the size of the tool, spar. Is the constructive style in which you operate it. How come you know all this? Been around, you know. Me know the good life. Is like these drinks we is drinking. My girlfriend is paying for it. She ain't no tease. She have the body and soul that make for the satisfying and the desiring. And she's a mother with mouths to feed, so she's got no time for playing. You dig? Mmm. That's the super cool Miriam. That is why we have to win this game to be the man who's doing the scoring and not the paying. That's the sermon of this lesson. This is the final lesson, boy. The boys, them back home, say the thing can close up and bind you. Me grandmother talk about them two locked in wickedness and he couldn't get out, and they had to live in shame for the rest of their lives. Well, if you're going to learn how to get it in, you're going to have to learn how to get it out. Watch now. I got to do that? That is the fiction, boy. You minding the truth, and the only way to do it is to do it, and you is ready for the doings. Well, what are you waiting for, darling? You've finished. Oh well, if you can't control yourself... Are you fucking betting or not? You getting anxious? Cha, man, you talk too much. I love your big mouth, boy. Your fifteen, and raise you twenty-five. Cool, baby, the angels is with us. Raise me now? What are you waiting for? See you for twenty-five. Cha! No way, partner. Hi, spar, what's happening? Listen, we sitting on a goldmine tonight, boy. Why not come down to the gambling club in the West End. No, listen, cool it, man. I have a couple of chicks who are organised for us tonight. We going blast this town to pieces. And look, don't walk, you know, take a cab, and when you come, bring some money for me. Listen, me's tired. What is the matter with you? Stop you moaning, you man. What you want to happen to me? You want me to get my throat cut? You want me to end up in the bottom of the river? All right, man, don't worry about your spar, Dave, just worry about your sleep and your flat. I leave it to you in my will. And when you coming bring a clean shirt for I. We're going rave with the winnings tonight, spar. DAVE: So, what you got? Ah.

You was winning all the way, off the table into the pockets. What you washing so early for? You not even dirty yet. Today this banna ain't getting dirty.

Listen, don't come here in my house and insult me, you know. Look, shut your mouth before I shoot you a slap. Hit me, and I swear I spend the rest of my life in jail.

You wait for the jailhouse to burn down, you wait for your granny to die, boy, and you is doing it again. You is running away from freedom. Oh, man, take your things and move out of here. Me don't have no time to put no more balls on your chains. Is you lie. Your hands take what they don't put. You want to plant your own field, spar?
