-Hi! Mr. Alexiou? -You must be Paschalis. Panayiotis put you out of your way. Yum-uh... Our things are all over your office. -It's not a lot for a wedding. -Thanks. Is Panayiotis the best man? Yes, but he's flying here because he's working. -When is the wedding? -On Sunday. -Congratulations. -Thank you very much. -Goodbye. -Bye. Is anyone out there? Can anyone hear me? Can anyone hear me out there? Anyone there? Ladies and gentlemen. The Captain and the Crew... ...welcome you to the ship and wish you bon voyage. Hello, Anthoula. I picked up the suit for the wedding. It's very nice. I got the wedding favors too. Lots of it. I got the wedding candles too. I just... I didn't get off the boat and now I'm going to Sifnos. Anthoula? Popi, is this you? What happened? She fainted? Is she coming to? Tell her not to worry. All will be just ﬁne. May I assume why you are in mourning? What do you assume? You are getting cold feet about your wedding. Well, you assume wrong. I know what I'm doing. My wedding is to take place on Miles on Sunday... ...and I'm trapped on the ship for Sifnos. Where's the problem? You still have time to return. There's one small problem. They're going on strike today. Look! Once in Piraeus, take the subway to the airport. There are planes that fly to Milos, you know. I don't have a problem with the subway. I hate flying. -You're afraid to fly? -I'm afraid of airplanes. You're not afraid of marriage and you're afraid of planes? I assume you are not the marrying type. I don't really like children, the racket, whining, underwear... ...and I don't like to sleep first... ...so I won't hear the guy's snoring. I don't snore. You look like a nice guy. Why are you getting yourself into this? She might be in love with you now, but soon... ...she'll be sending you out so you won't get in her way. I love her, she loves me and we'll be in love forever. Right. You might be down, but your optimism... ...is far beyond the limits of science fiction. Has your fiancee ever seen you like this? The Captain and the Crew thank you... ...for traveling with us and we hope to see you all soon. Anthoula, my love, I just arrived in Sifnos. Don't worry, my love. I'll swim there if I have to. She hung up on me. -You must really love her. -She's a very nice person. -But not very calm. -You heard her screaming? -And the rest of the island. What am I doing here? Come take a break and we'll think of something. Don't you want to take a shower? No, I'm fine. Yes, I can see that. Anthoula, I'll be going to the travel agencies... ...to find a way to get myself back. As soon as possible. Yes, my love. We'll be going in ﬁve minutes. Don't look at that, it's a cruise ship. How did you get from Agrinio to Milos? I got a job there as an agriculturist. My name is Paschalis. -I'm Zoe. Have you been there long? -Five months. Five months? And you managed to find Anthoula... ...and you decided to tie the knot? Congratulations! That was very quick. -I fell in love with her. How about you? -I'm a photographer. I work for an agency in Paris but I travel around. That's why you are not into marriage. I'm not into anything that gets on my nerves. -Like I'm doing right now. -Let's go. Look on the bright side. Three days in Sifnos. There's only one side... Destruction! -You said you'd swim back. -Are you making fun of me? Me? You are leading her on. That's what you told her! Yes! I'm wherever I want, Vangelis. We're off alone. I won't need any help or any collaboration. You never know. The student might be better than the teacher. I'll hang up now. You're drinking your coffee as if you're at a memorial service. I'm getting married on Sunday... ...and I'm on the wrong island. -On a beautiful island. -I didn't mean that. -Whatever! Let's go leave the things in the room... ...because it will look as if I'm the bride... ...and then you'll come with me. -Where? -Let's go. -Sofia? -Yes, my love? I'm going for a walk. Back in two hours. - I'll be cooking fish. - For starters? Come on, Anestis! We have to eat right. That's what I'm doing. I walk more now than I did in the army. I believe you. You walked through so many hallways at the Minister's office. I wanted to go to the Special Forces. Right. And don't eat anything. Keep away from bakeries! Okay, we'll have fish for lunch. -I have to work, you know. -And what about me? You sit back and relax. We'll think of something. Look around you. The landscape is beautiful. -Is this what you photograph? -This too. Usually I photograph whatever is in motion. -Weddings? -You are really obsessed! -Can I hold that for you? -If it's not that difficult. Of course! -Look! There! -What happened? You can see Miles from here. Milos is on the other side. You see Milos everywhere. -I wish I were a seagull. -Do seagulls get married? You are not helping! You keep scolding me. Can you give me the case so I can change lenses? Go take a walk so I can finish working. Just stay close by. Okay, I won't go far. Zoe? Where are you? What is it? There are two Iadybugs here and they're... ...copulating! You should photograph this! Would you like to be photographed... ...while doing that with your fiancee? No. Zoe? A man keeled over! -How did he fall? -I think he fainted! Do you think he tripped? -Let's see if he's hurt. He doesn't look hurt. Can you do mouth to mouth resuscitation? The "kiss of life?" -Yes. Go on! What are you waiting for? -Me? -You do it! Me? I'm getting married on Sunday! What happened? Who are you? Calm down. It's okay. We found you on the ground. I think I fainted. It's happened before. I have a problem with my heart. I came to light a candle and to pray for my health... ...and I fell after coming out of the church. Your prayers were not answered then. I'll go elsewhere the next time. Are you thinking of where you'll go the next time? I was relaxing, you two saved me. Bless you. You were a godsend. -I'm here to work. Paschalis was probably sent by God. Yes. I'm here by chance. Would you like us to take you home? I don't want to be a burden. Did you see a cheese pie at the spot where I fell? -Was it half-eaten? -Yes, that was it. Anestis! What happened? Everything is well, my love. It was a small heart attack but nothing to worry about. We'll do some tests but he just needs to rest. -Can I eat anything, doctor? -Come on, Anestis! -Eat light. -What's this, Anestis? -What? -What's this? I have no idea. I can't remember. Fine. Thank you, doctor. -Thank that couple. Luckily they were there, otherwise... Thank you. I took a seminar for volunteers at the Red Cross once. That's where I was trained. -I can do it too but... But what? I'm not your type? -No, he's getting married. -Yes, I'm getting married. Why that mournful expression, Paschalis? -Why are you like this? -Forget it. I don't want to lay it on you too. Tell us what happened to you? How can anyone go out to sea without his mobile phone? He forgot it. Fine. Aspasia, when he calls you, have him call me immediately. If we find Tasos, he'll have you in Miles in half an hour. He's a bit eccentric but very obliging. He's Tasos, the newlywed. - I'll be that too. He's been "newlywed" four times in five years. Come on, relax. Nothing will come out of being stressed out. I'll take care of this. In the meantime, you're my guests. -No, it's not necessary. -I don't know what to say. I'm getting married in two days! What am I doing now? -Do you want to get off? -No! No! These people are very polite and friendly. And as you saw, they know everyone. When you were in the garden, he was talking with a Minister. You are very lucky in your misfortune. See what a kiss can do? -It was the "kiss of life." That's the way. Relax. Smile. It makes you look good. That was it? Your gaiety doesn't last very long. Paschalis? You are very organized. Did you bring the priest too? That's easy. What do we do about a bride? There are beautiful girls on Sifnos. They cook very well too. Come on, we're joking! Good. You are raising my spirits. Yes, but you have to make an effort too. Come on, Zoe. -I am making an effort. Forget it. Let's go. NEW EMAIL "Your mission is to be accomplished...“ ”...as soon as possible. ” "Once you send the rest of my fee...“ ”...my mission will be accomplished immediately. ” "The last installment will not be paid... ” ”...unless you go through with our deal. ” Yes? Hello, my love? Out of breath? No, I wasn't doing anything. No, I was trying to catch the mobile. I don't have any news. Once I speak with that man, I'll call. I love you. They're nice people and very helpful. Zoe? Paschalis? Come for a drink! It was the lady of the house. She called us to drink some orange juice. There's another lady here helping me find a way to leave. I don't know her. There's another lady here too, my love! But we'll be together tomorrow. Calm down! Anthoula? I am not getting involved and that's final! But you want me to coordinate three Ministers! You think that's easy? I've done more difficult things. Look, Apostolis... For the last time, I want to be left alone. What else do I want? You take care of that. You know. Bye. You were very into that book today. Yes. I read a lot. It keeps me company since I travel a lot for work. -And you, Paschalis? -Excuse me? -Do you read? -Yes! No, I don't read a lot. Just stuff for work. Plant diseases, prevention and therapies. We're thinking of planting a cherry tree. Do you think it will grow? -When I come back... ...I'll bring you one and I'll plant it myself. As a gift. To come back, first you have to leave. She's bugging you. You'll leave very soon... ...and you'll be with your Beloved again. There was a time when, due to bad weather... ...we were separated for four days. Remember? -We freaked out! -So as you see... ...we might get really bad weather too. -You're not for marriage, right? -It doesn't thrill her. I see that you two got to know each other. A little. Cheers! Drink, Paschalis. It'll get rid of the stress. I'll deal with the stress by meditating. -Okay, drink now. -Come. Cheers! -Sofia? -Yes? Telephone! It's your sister. Yes, Annoula. What happened? She's quarrelling with Antonis again. Tell me. Can't you two relax and work it all out? So he says one thing, you say another... The thing is that you two fight every single day! Yes. I'll come. In a little bit. Bye. What can I do? -Do what you do every day. Do you want me to come? -No, I don't want you involved. I won't be late. Do you want me to bring anything? Some Greek sweets would be fine. Be careful. -Bye. Will this take long? I brought you here so that you can relax. When Anestis finds his friend, he'll call us. Okay, I'm sorry. FERRYBOAT EMPLOYEES ON STRIKE UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE NEW EMAIL EMAIL FROM p15 "Go through with your orders TODAY!“ ”Send me the rest of my fee. ” -We found Anestis' friend. -So you're leaving. Yes, I am. I don't have a signal. -Here, take my phone. Anthoula, my love! I'll be at the port soon. Once I'm on board, I'll call you. Kisses! Was she yelling from her enthusiasm? She said, "yippee!" She likes to express herself. What glory! What grandeur! Hi, Tasos! I don't know how to thank you, Mr. Anestis. And you too, Zoe. -It was our pleasure. Come see us sometime with your wife. Absolutely! Come! Why don't you all come along? We'll be back in an hour. No, because I had some trouble yesterday. -What happened? -Nothing. I'm fine. Great! And you Miss? Why don't you come to keep me company, baby? Come on! You'll be late! You two will get there sooner. We'll fly there! Put this on. Tie it up tightly and don't be afraid. It glows at night and they can see you from kilometers away. I also have flares with me. Green, red and yellow! I even have fancy ones for celebrations. -Great. -I have everything. Your life jacket has a safety light. And, yes, there is also a whistle. Don't whistle! It's for an emergency at night. I'm sorry. Sorry for the trouble. -So, you're getting married! -Yes! Yes! -Is it the first time? -Yes, the first! -You're sad that Paschalis left. -No. Not really. -He's a real nice guy. -Yes. Very. But he's getting married. He's got his life planned out. What happened? They changed course. They are headed for Serifos. -He's taking him elsewhere? -I don't know. Tasos, it's Anestis. You lost sight of us, right? No, because I see you heading for Serifos. -Where are we to go? -To Milos! Paschalis, why don't you say anything? We're headed for Serifos! -What? How would I know? I'm from Agrinio. Don't worry, Anestis! I'll turn around! Bye! I hope he finds Milos. Don't worry, he is bound to go to the right one. There are islands all around here. -Nice place. -And the people are great. One can relax here. There's nothing to be afraid of. Right. How are things in Paris? If your job is difficult, it doesn't matter where you are. -Try to see it differently. -It's not always that easy. It depends on your goals. I don't set goals any more. I have achieved a lot of them. I love Sofia. We live here peacefully and happily. And if you don't set goals, you don't become a target. MESSAGE FROM p15 "Your mission has been temporarily postponed. ” "Deposit my fee by 2 pm or else l will carry out my orders.“ Zoe, would you like to go jogging? Now? There are great places to jog by the shore. - Anestis, we won't be late. - I'll be here. What's wrong? You look pensive. I'm okay. Come. I'll get you something to wear. -Isn't it nice here? -Yes. So, tell me about Anestis. He's been working from very young. He's self-made. Now he is enjoying everything. -Was the factory big? -Yes, one of the biggest. He decided to sell everything and we came to live here. It's very beautiful here. You feel alive here. Zoe... I live with this fear. That something might happen to Anestis? Yes, but not because of his health. Tell me. I'm listening. His success with his business and his connections... ...are the reason why he has many enemies. I think someone is trying to hurt him... ...even though he's retired. You hurt someone to gain something or to take revenge. It's probably revenge because he was always successful. I love Anestis so much, that if anything happens to him... ...I'll go crazy. It's too romantic and peaceful here for him to be in danger. Wasn't Paschalis' presence here a bit odd? -Pascha|is? -Yes, Paschalis. A guy with wedding candles is out of the ordinary. -No, I don't think so. -He scared me, Zoe. He could be someone who wants to hurt Anestis. Even if that were true, he's gone now. I feel much better now that he's gone. Who is it now? It's my sister. She's quarrelling with her husband again. Hi, Annoula. No, I can't come. It's the same thing all over again. No, I can't. Tomorrow! Okay, bye. It's a real sorry marriage. Shall we go? Yes. Now is the time for coffee, right? Who's going to make me some? -Sofia, of course! Water? -Yes, thank you. His stomach is empty and his intestines inside out. When he's better, he should find a way to drive to Milos! He was going real fast. He was maneuvering to impress me. The boat would hit the water real hard... ...and we were lucky it didn't sink! I only thought of what to hold on to if it sank. And he would constantly lose his orientation. At some point he said that Amorgos was straight ahead... ...and he turned to go elsewhere. It's a miracle we found Sifnos again... ...and we didn't arrive on the shores of Lebanon. I could have been held captive there! -Drink some water! -No, I drank lots of sea water. Hello? Yes, Anthoula. Don't wait for me at the port. Go home, Anthoula. Because... Because I returned. I couldn't handle that small ship. I got nauseous. She fainted. It's the third time she does that. Tell her not to worry. We'll find another way to get you there. Anthoula, can you hear me? Can anyone hear me there? She hung up. -Is your fiancee beautiful? -To me she is very beautiful. Others think that she's slightly overweight. -What does the scale show? -All the scales show the same. That's my problem too. Is she rich? -She has a rich soul. -Is she good in bed? She is insatiable. I'm the one who almost drowned here. If you want to swim, I'll give you a bathing suit. It's okay. Thank you. -I got it! -What? - I'll call Amfilochios. - Does he have a bigger boat? -Leave it up to me. -That's right! Who is he? Hello, my man! It's Anestis. Where are you? Great! Come over because I want you to fly somewhere. It's important. Thank you. -I should have thought of him. -Can we count on him. -Of course. -Don't worry. It's done! You'll be with Anthoula by early evening. You are so in love with her now. Soon you'll be leaving her alone, you'll be nasty to her... ...and you'll keep her just to make babies. You should have been a Family Planning social worker. Are kids so bad? They're bad for my body. Soon they'll clone them and we'll get them already made. I might get one then. We have different opinions on this issue. You're destined not to get married... ...and you're going against your destiny. Be careful. You'll end up like Sofia's sister. She quarrels every day with her husband. Open your eyes. Amfilochios is here. I see why you wanted him to "fly somewhere." I promise you won't even feel it. You'll be there in no time! -I don't fly! I'm scared! What's to be afraid of? NI prove you wrong! It might crash. I don't care if a boat sinks. I can swim! I can't fly! - Who said we'll be flying? - You'll be 10 meters over the sea. It's like driving. On the ship, you'd be 20 meters over the sea. Come! I'll get you floaties! It's not like you are at thirty thousand feet! - What if we crash on a skerry? - You'll be beside me... ...and you can point out the skerries. I can't follow your logic... - We'll be eating in a bit. - Good. And I realized that I'm out of fuel. - Totally? - For one minute more. I'm over the sea at three hundred meters. What would you do? -I wouldn't be on the helicopter. He's not the right man to answer this. And then I see... Are you following? And then I see... Are you listening? I'd prefer not to. So, two miles away I see a cruise ship. Right in front of me! I fly like a kamikaze... ...and then I land on the deck like a king! You should have seen them! They yelled for the Captain. I went outwith a tall Bulgarian chick that night. Here's another one... -Come eat! -Some wine, Paschalis? -Just a bit. To our health! -So... To our health! -Bottoms up! That's right! So she says... So Anthoula says to me... "Where do you want us to get married, my love?" "On the island or in Agrinio?" - So she proposed to you! - Exactly. And then I answered... -What? "In Agrinio." He said, "on the island!" "In church," I said! He's ready to pass out! He just landed! My doll! My love! My baby! Anthoula! I'll put on a bathing suit and I'll come to you, my love! Be careful, Paschalis! Get your things and we'll go now! He's gone! "You are the air that I breathe. ” Slow down or we will both fall. Hold on! Do you think they need help? I don't think so. Don't worry. Zoe can make do. -Isn't it a beautiful day? -True! See? Some things don't need any help. They work out on their own. And then they say that if you drink too much you can't... What do you mean "you can't?" And just who is this boy going to marry? A girl from Milos. -From Milos. -Yes, from Milos. -A girl. -Yes, a girl. He fell asleep. Good. We'll carry him like a baby. How could you carry him like this? He'll be just fine. He's an agriculturist. EMAIL FROM p15 "Your mission is to be carried out IMMEDIATELY!" "Stick to our original deal. ” "We'll decide what that deal will be!" Zoe? Come sit with us! Would you like some coffee or a drink? -Yes. I'm coming. -A drink would be fine, but. Amfilochios, can you hear me? Is everything okay? -Yes. We're about to land. Bring him back! Yes! You heard right! Bring him back! Okay, Anestis. We're coming back. But why, Anestis? They should come to get him. "Come and get him." He's been worried sick since yesterday. And the only thing his fiancee does, is to faint. Alright, Zoe? He was fast asleep and then he jumped up... ...and then he either fainted or fell asleep. - So he's alive? - Alive and snoring! -Right. -I agree. -He said he doesn't snore. -Tell him. Would an orangutan scare you more? -I don't think so. Where am I? -Where would you like to be? I'm asking as if I don't know. I'm starting to remember what happened on this bed. At least you are remembering just that. -I've destroyed everything. -You've done no such thing. You're just fine. -I'm real lousy. So, tell me... How could you be so passionate and drunk too? -I follow my instinct. -Your instinct is fine with this... ...but it's way off on the wedding. Yes, of course. And I'm getting married tomorrow. What did I do here? Why did I stay here? I have to call Zoe... I have to call Anthoula, I meant. Where is my phone? We'll talk when you are drunk again. -I'm in trouble, Anestis. -Stay calm. -How? -Make an effort... ...otherwise one day you'll regret you did this. -It puzzles me. -But you'll find the answer. -But my Anthoula... -Screams constantly. -But Zoe... -She want's you. Let's go. They're waiting for us. -Why did you order all this? -We have to feed the kids! What kids? A whole school? Two more chick-pea balls, please! No, Anestis! We'll wait for the kids. Hello, Aristidis! Yes, very well. I have some guests here. I'll be in Athens soon and we'll talk there. Say hello to Helena! Bye! How could that Aristidis still be a Minister? -He wanted to come here. -You did well. I saw you. -I'm very confused, Zoe. -Do you feel guilty? That's just it. I don't feel guilty. -So where's the problem? -I'm the problem. That is a real brave realization. -So you agree with me. -Yes, from the beginning. -Now what do we do? -Now I want you! I want you. That's some kiss! Now I see why Anestis came back to life. He is a very nice guy. Zoe is a bit of a mystery. She's interesting. -She's a splendid girl. Paschalis, on the other hand, is a bit strange. Could someone in love become so weird? Worse things could be done by someone in love. I hope that's the case. -They're coming? -Worse things? No, Paschalis and Zoe are coming. -Sofia... -What about her? -She looks at me strangely. -How? With hostility? Amorously? In wonder? How? - The second one. - Amorously. Yes. I feel bad. Anestis is a good man. -Leave it rather. -I should? Yes, forget it. Come, the food will get cold. Are you expecting more people? No, just you two. Let's start. What is this, Zoe? -Haven't you gone to the Army? -Yes. Put it down or it will go "boom." They freaked when they saw it at the airport. - Is it fake? - Obviously, silly boy. It's from a photo shoot in Athens. Was the case open? No, I went to move it and it opened. Remind me to ship it back tomorrow. Don't say anything. We don't want to scare them. -He called me a rag! -You called him a hillbilly. -And he hit me first! -You talking about last night? 41-11:me He pushed me into the closet and I landed on the clothes. I was helpless and he started to hit me. He didn't aim first. But he did hit the target. -What did you do! -I kicked him real hard. Kicking is not the way to solve your differences. -We don't have differences. -Where's the problem then? He's bored with me and he won't accept it. Where is Anestis? He's resting. I got caught with trimming scissors. By the time I proved I was an agriculturist... ...I spent 5 hours at the Station. It's easier to carry a gun than trimming scissors. -You think so? -Yes. This place seems fine. No, let's go further down. You were right. At the post office, they would ask too many questions. They are totally oblivious too.

The girl took a bite off it. Where is my apple? -I forgot. That's okay. Come here. I'm bored with this issue! Wait a second. I have no reason to get involved. Work it out by yourselves. If you kill each other we’ll all be okay. Okay, I’m coming. -Did you hear that? Nice life! Is that how you want to live? I don't know what I want. I'm very confused. -Me too. -What do you mean? Nothing. See how happy Anestis and Sofia are? Yes? Hello, Anthoula. No, I wasn't... Anthoula, I will... Can I ask something of you? Can we postpone this thing for a couple of weeks? Why? Will you be getting bored of me in a couple of weeks? She said that if I'm not there in two hours... ...the wedding is cancelled and she won't see me ever again. Stop it! Slow down! We can't do this every half an hour! - It's been a hour! - Really? Why didn't you say so? Come here! Come! Let me go! Yes? Yes, Anthoula? What? But how? What happened, Paschalis? So a real landing will take place in Sifnos! Exactly. What am I going to do? I don't know. Listen, Paschalis. You have good reason to disappear. And that reason is Zoe. But you have to go meet them... ...because you promised them a wedding. There's one confusion after the other. -I'd go with Zoe. -Yes, but he's honest. That's not always good. If I disappear, I won't be able to set foot on Milos again. So? There are many other islands. -This is serious. -Zoe, say something. She can't. She's serious too. -I'm not serious. -This whole thing is suspicious. I should have been more careful... ...but I have made a promise. I gave my word. That boat belongs to Anthoula's uncle. They're coming to take you back as if you were Helen of Troy. And there is Menelaus with a wedding dress. I'm joking! Don't be like this. You're getting married. That's right, Anestis. I gave them my word. -So there is a bride. Unfortunately. Get some water! Let him have it! -They're shooting in the air! -They got him married already! He didn't even get to know me well. You can't see someone seriously by just having sex. It has to do with upbringing. Right, my love? Let me try to remember. Sofia! Zoe, you are young... ...so full of energy. Move on and don't get frustrated. How can I not get frustrated? All my relationships before Paschalis... ...short as it was with him, were very lousy. It could be from bad luck or bad choices. They threw me off my goals and made me feel guilty. What do you mean? Professionally. I was taken advantage of... ...and psychologically oppressed. Photography is a harsh profession for a woman. Yes. My grandfather had a studio in Athens. Then, my father took over... ...but I wanted to leave the country. Oh, well. In a place like this, one should only think good thoughts. That's it, Zoe. Stay optimistic. I'm trying to find a reason to do that. Don't try too hard. There is your reason. I told you... I don't fly but I do swim. Stop it! You scared me! What happened? Did you escape? -I'm a fugitive. -What about the gunshots? The whole island heard them! Those were aimed at me! Nice target! You are just fine! Go change or you'll get a cold. We'll talk later. Yes, Annoula! Now what happened? I've had enough. I can't come. Okay, I'll come, but this is the last time! Bye. I'm going to my sister's! I won't be late! Okay, my love! We'll be here! -I want to hear this again. -Me too! Anything you want. You two talk. I'm going to call my office. - Take your time. It's over now. - We'll see. -What's happening? -Stop everything. Fortunately, nothing bad happened. And I hope nothing Will. -Tell me what happened. Pavlos lied to us. Our father died from heart failure... ...and not because of Anestis. Things were good between them. Anestis was the best employer. Pavlos has a very bad criminal record. Blackmail and fraud. Come to your own conclusions now. -Who told you all this? -I found out... ...from one of our father's close colleagues. I looked into it when I saw the love of your life... ...flirting around the island. - FIirting? He's an idiot and we're totally stupid. He wanted us to kill Anestis! You'd inherit everything. Who knows what he'd do to you after you married him. How could you get involved with him? You were fine with Anestis! I was and I still am. I am! I'm going to Pavlos. -Not by yourself! I'll come too. -No, I'm going alone. Be at our usual spot in two minutes. -This was sudden, my love. -Don't come closer... ...and I'm not your love. -What are you talking about? -Leave the island now! I know everything! What do you know? Get serious, Sofia! Get lost, now! Now! Before I go, your husband will find out about your plans. It might have happened already. I made a call previously. If something happens to Anestis, I'll tear you to pieces! You creep! "The amount you’ve received already... ” "...is enough for heavy bodily damage. ”Carry out this order NOW! [71 expect an immediate response. ” EMAIL FROM p15 "Go fuck yourself, asshole! IMMEDIATELY! NOW!" -Do you want to take a walk? -In a couple of minutes. Okay. Take your time. You have called the COSMOTE information line. "Take the 2 pm. ferryboat, Pavlos! GET LOST!" "IMMEDIATELY! NOW!" EMAIL FROM ARIS -Anestis? -What's wrong, Sofia? I love you! I love you too, but you don't see me crying. Milos is this way and Serifos is that way. No, no, no! Zoe... I want to marry you. Are you serious? -Yes, now that I'm still into it. -Sit down. So, you are really obsessed! I realized that you are totally different. That's true! But you don't really know me. I mean, I could be a criminal. No, you are unique. I trust my instinct. -We're okay like this. -It's wonderful... ...but we should get married. Have I compromised you and I must make up for it? No, but I'm thinking of family, children... Just two. I don't want your body to stretch. Must we get married to have children? We'll have them any way you want. There is only one way to have them. Are you crying? Many have cried because of me... ...but no one for me. it was easier in the beginning. You had candles, the suit... You don't need all that to marry and live happily... ...you only need to ﬁnd someone! Look at what they teach them in Agronomics School. Zoe, aside from photography, do you do anything else? I've had various jobs in the past. -How about you, Paschalis? -I'm an agriculturalist. You can stay with us. The house next door is yours... ...as well as anything else you might need. Take time to think about it and then tell me. Let's go. Isn't it beautiful here? We come here very often. What's wrong? What's going on? Let's sit down. Did Pavlos leave? Don't worry. I want you to feel safe with us. We've come to really love you both. He left. He won't come back. He's a coward. At the thought of the Cyclades, he'll run to Epirus! Even if he does come back, I'll deal with him personally. That's my offer. What about Paschalis? One shouldn't go overboard. He is peace-loving and law-abiding. He's ideal for anyone who wants to seclude himself... ...and to settle down. So you mean... Yes, to finally settle down. You were lucky to meet Anestis. I was unfortunate to meet someone... ...who taught me a not so nice profession. Love can be a bad thing. So... So, I'll continue with my first profession as a photographer... ...on the island. I also know how to fish. But first... ...I want you to give me a bank account number. I have something to return to you. Anestis, they'll stay! They'll stay! -Antonis? -Yes, he's a changed man! He apologized for the first time. He swore that we'll never quarrel again. If he grieves me again, he'll jump off the castle walls. Yeah, right. I jumped off too and now I'm just fine.
