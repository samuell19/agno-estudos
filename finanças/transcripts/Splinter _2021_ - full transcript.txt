Well, that's all up to you, John. I wish I had taken more photographs of them. I get scared that I'll forget what they look like. [psychiatrist] Is that why you won't leave the house? Why you keep things the way they were before? Because you think you might forget Sarah and Michael? I don't know. I don't... I don't know. I... I can still feel 'em here. [psychiatrist] Well, that's understandable. No, no, no. I mean, I can really feel them. It's not like a memory. It's... It's as if they're in the next room just waiting for me. Tell me again about that night. No. No, I'd rather not, no. [sighs] Yeah, that's right, just, um, just go ahead and write it down. Yeah, I'm... I'm... I'm really getting sick of all this. I lost my family. They were murdered. How would you feel if someone broke into your house and murdered your family? I'd be angry. In fact, I'd be fucking enraged. Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's exactly right. I'm not here to judge you. Why are you here? [psychiatrist] To listen. Or to see if I'm crazy, keep giving me drugs. I'm not sick. I don't need these pills. They're to help your depression. [scoffs] Maybe... Maybe I'm supposed to be depressed. Maybe... Maybe that's the normal reaction. Oh, it is. But, I'm here to help you through it. Like the pills. They're to help you cope 'til you don't need them. I'm sor... sorry. No need to apologize. Enough talking for now. Wouldn't you agree? Feel better? Yeah. [psychiatrist] Before I leave, there's one thing I'd like you to try. Why don't you open the curtains? The human body needs light. The human brain needs light. Small steps, John.

Progress? Well, you could hardly open the curtains. Now you seem... different. Ah, well, you see, I've had an epiphany. - Yes? - Mm. I realized what a little pussy I was being. And what's brought this change about? Well, when I was a kid, you see, I was always getting bullied. Happened a few times. Guess I must have that kind of face. But this one kid in particular, this really hard kid, Ryan, he made my life hell. You know, took money off me, kicked me, punched me, especially in front of the girls. I hated that little bastard more than anything. But then, I made a friend. He was someone who wasn't like me, you know? He wasn't afraid of kids like Ryan. And then one day, I was getting the usual beating when Bobby steps in. Grabs hold of one of Ryan's football boots and starts whacking him around the face with it over and over again. Yeah. Those studs really ripped into his skin. Tore his face off. Left him with scars. Something to remember. What did it make you feel, witnessing such violence? Felt like justice. And now? How do you feel looking at it from a grown-up perspective? I wish he'd killed the little fucker. How are things going with the medication? Great. [psychiatrist] I hear your brother's going on a cruise. A long one hopefully. - He invited you? - [John scoffs] Well, he's not exactly my first choice of holiday companion. How about you? - Me? - Yeah. - Ever been on a cruise? - [psychiatrist] No. No. No, no, you're right. No, no. I see you more as a, um, beach bum, you know? Sitting on the beach with your slinky little bikini, drinking cocktails. Where would you like to go on holiday? [chuckles] Well, that beach and cocktail sounds pretty good. - How is the drinking? - [John] Oh, it's great. I'm thinking of going pro. [psychiatrist] You don't want to talk about it? [scoffs] Aye yi yi yi. Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. Oh, come on, you must get pretty sick of people whining on. "I cannot sleep." "I wet the bed when I was a teenager." "I can't stop fucking my wife's friends." I'm afraid it's not usually quite so exciting. But, no, I... I don't get bored. I like helping people. Like you. Do I look like I need your help? I think our time is up. Hey. You never told me you had such a hot shrink. No wonder you keep up the act. Getting her to feel sorry for you. [forced sobbing] "I miss my wife. I'm so sad." "What? Would showing me your tits make me feel better? You know, I think it might." Sorry I had to leave you in there. I couldn't trust you weren't gonna spill the beans and tell her all about me. And all the other stuff. Oh. Found this in the bin. Someone trying to tell you something. Pretty concise. You have to admire that. Why are you looking at me like that? I'm your best friend. It's all done to protect you. Now, I'll let you out if you promise not to go blabbing about what we've done. Deal? Deal? Cool. Have to say, John, it's good to be home.

He's not been home for two nights, and the last I heard, he was coming over here. I don't know what you're talking about. Now, please leave. Before I call the police. Go on. Yeah, do it. Call the police. Get out. Now. What have you done to him, you crazy fucker? Just leave before something bad happens. All right. Yeah, I'm leaving. But, I'll be back. I'm gonna bring the police with me, and they're gonna find out what's happened to him. [tense music] [echoing footsteps] [light switch clicking] Is this a fuckin' disco? Got a real problem with this. It's OCD. What triggers something like that? I don't know. I just... I just get scared. I just don't fuckin' get it. Drives me crazy. What are you scared of? Nothing. Where you been all day? Hiding in Michael's room? Don't you think it's time you moved on? I took down all that kid's stuff, binned it. I have to tell you, it gave me the creeps. He's my son. Was your son. If you listen to rumors, even that's debatable. What? Oh. [clicks tongue] That's not from my lips. But Sarah was younger than you. She had her admirers. You have to admit, Michael looks nothing like you. Hey. Remember, you called me. No. No, I didn't. No, no, no, no, I didn't. You might think that. But whenever there's trouble, you call on good, old Bobby to come and sort out a problem. I'm always here. Who do you think got you your first date with Sarah? Hm? You would never have called her if I hadn't been whispering in your ear. Don't you even... Don't you talk about her. Don't talk about my wife. Don't even mention her name. What? Sarah. Wow, so won't want to hear that I used to fuck her while you were asleep. Yeah, yeah. While you were off in dreamland, Sarah was sucking my cock. - Hey, hey. - [gagging] So, you miss kissing her? It's all right. We're buddies. We've been friends since we were kids, and I've never let you down. We're older now, but there's no reason why we can't be compadres, amigos. What do you say? Give me five. [John coughs] Guess not, huh? [John coughs] I'm impressed. You've grown up. Almost. Just leave me alone. Oh. All you got to do is ask and I'll leave. Ask and I'm gone. Would you... would you leave? What? I said, will you leave? No. No. [Bobby grunts] That your best shot? Huh? [John groans] Um, I live here too. You fucking leave! [John groans] See ya. Don't be a stranger. I ain't going anywhere. [Michael] Don't worry, Daddy. He can't hurt you in here. [sobbing] [John sobbing] Hello? Hello? John? Hello? John?

Let me make you a cup of tea, hm? No. No, no, no, no. Please. Please. Please don't leave me. I... I... I... I... don't want you to get hurt. Who will hurt me, John? You can tell me. He might be listening. Have you been taking your medication? No, it's not the pills. You stopped taking them? No, he's... he's been here. He's been here before. [psychiatrist] No. Please, he'll... He'll be waiting for me. - Now, listen to me, John. - He'll be watching me. You stopped taking your medication, which has opened a door in your brain, and now someone has walked through. No, he... he's here. He's really here. Calm down, John. We can deal with this person. But, you don't know him. You don't know what he's like. Do you trust me? [John] Do I trust you? Do you trust me? Yes. Yes. Yes, I trust the doctor, yes. - Yes. - Then tell me his name. His name? - His name. - His name. His name is... His name is... His name is Bobby. Bobby.
