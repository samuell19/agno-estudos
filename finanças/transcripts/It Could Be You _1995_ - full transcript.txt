-[dramatic music] -[flames whooshing] [engine grumbling] We're running out of petrol, Bob. Well, stop, for Christ's sakes, stop. Okay, love. There's a garage. Here's a garage. [tyres screeching] And now we push, Bob. Backwards. It could be your lucky week. I'm owed a lucky week, ain't I? It's never your lucky week, Bob. When was your last lucky week? June the 23rd, 1978. [Wendy sighing] [engine whirring] We got married on June the 23rd, 1978. I know. What was lucky about that? [cash register whirring] What a place to run out of petrol, eh? She said, you know, get some petrol as we'd run out, sort of thing. So... It's nice to see you, anyway. Must be our lucky week, eh? Here, have a lottery ticket. It's a 25 million jackpot this week, Bobby. You could do whatever you like, couldn't you? Go where you like. With who you like. You wouldn't have to take no orders from no one, would you? Everyone takes orders from someone. Not if you got 25 million quid, you don't. Eh? I'll pay. It's on me. Don't tell the wife. What time did you get married? One o'clock on the dot. One. 23. It would be June 6. 19. Seven. Eight. Feels lucky. Maybe it is lucky seeing you, you know? Maybe it was fate running out of petrol right outside your garage. Bob. What are you doing in here? Oh, he's being ever so good, I promise. And could you have a look at the iron? I've been on at you now for about the last three weeks. Okay, okay. [toolbox clacking] [tools clacking] Bob, give us that jacket, could you, and I'll stick it in the wash? Right, love. [Wendy] And don't be long with the iron. Okay, okay, okay. And them jeans while you're at it. What's that book you got? * Run around with everyone, you know it is true * What's up with you two? Just married, that's all. Trousers off. And your shirt, might as well do that and all. Here you are. Is that why you're reading books like this? That's my private book. What's up with him? Search me. What's up with you, Bob? Nothing's up with me. Maybe I'm just fed up with doing the same job every day. With coming home to the same house as well, maybe. And always doing the same things. Maybe I want something different. Something new and strange. Think you should put your trousers on before making remarks like that. Bob. Yeah? Do we need a book to tell us how to do it? Is it that bad? No, love. I just don't feel you and I... What? Nothing. [engine revving] Actually, it's rather well-written. Bin's the best place for that. What is it with him these days? Give him a break, Mom. You think I'm hard on him and all, don't you? Everyone thinks I give him a hard time 'cause he looks so bloody easygoing. But you try living with him. I do, Mom. If you won 25 million quid, or rather if we won 25 million quid. Oh, we're a syndicate now, are we? We might then, won't we? I suppose. Don't you ever think that you might change your life? Don't you ever think you might wake up and it'll all be different? No. Oh, take me home. I've had enough. Sue- No, it's always parks and pubs and hotels where no one knows us, isn't it? I should be in Ruislip. Sue? Sue. I was looking at that book. Was you? Some of it's rather, you know. Rather what? Erotic. Oh. [dramatic music] [Announcer] Welcome to our television centre in London- -Yes, love? -It's "Lottery Live" live tonight. Video it for me, could you? You're a sad man. Bob. Do you feel I'm not, you know, adventurous enough? I think you're very adventurous, love. Your driving terrifies me. I like the one when they're in the shower. Which one was that? Or in the open air. That one's nice. You did get this book with me in mind, did you? Or were you just keen to sharpen up your technique in general? [Male Announcer] Is a record 25 million pounds. Here are the balls for tonight's draw. Draw master, start loading the machine. Pardon me if I'm mistaken, but I get the distinct impression you're finding the TV more interesting than me. Of course not, love. Are you still angry with me 'cause I went back to work? Is that it? I'm just trying to listen to the programme, that's all. [Sue sighing] You've been with a man. I can tell. I would know. Oh, you're an expert in the field, ain't you? -Number one- -One? That's the first number. Have you got a ticket? There's no point if you ain't got a ticket. [Male Announcer] Five times drawn before. The last time in July. [audience applauding] The second ball tonight is number 23. One, 23. -What about it? -Two numbers. What are you on about? Did this man buy you a ticket? -No. -There's no point if you ain't got a ticket. Bob. Are you listening to me? I thought he said 23. Oh, you rude bastard. I am trying to talk about us, Bob. [Male Announcer] 25 million pounds. Have you bought a ticket and not told me? Of course not, love. -One, 23, six. -What about it? That's when he got married. One o'clock on the 23rd of June. Have you gone barmy? Bob. Have you done something you're not telling me? I haven't done nothing. All I've done is drive my van around and mend fuses. [Male Announcer] The fifth ball tonight is number seven. Last seen in August and five times- Don't you love me anymore? Is that what all this is about? [Sue cheering] One o'clock on the 23rd of June, 1978. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it was a lucky lizzo. [Male Announcer] Number seven. Number eight. Oh, it was a lucky day to get married, eh? What are you on about? 25 million, that's what. 25... You got a ticket. Is it your fancy man's? They always go back to their wives, always. Of course I love you. I never stopped loving you, even when you... Even when what? Even when what? Maybe we should pack it in, Bob. Maybe there's nothing there anymore. -[phone ringing] -I'll get it. Hello? Who's there? Hello? Who's that? [Bob sighing] [Male Announcer] Watch those orange lights. [dramatic music] One o'clock. 23rd. June. 1978. 1978. How can you do this to me? Oh, don't play with my emotions. Give me an eight, give me an eight, give me an eight. I will love you forever, God. I will be a model citizen. I'll never look at another woman, God. I will be extremely grateful. [triumphant music] Jesus Christ. 25 million quid. -I- -[window tapping] Sue. I tried to ring, but your wife answered. We can't talk here. I'll come out. Give us a moment. Hey, those were the numbers, weren't they? Bobby. The ticket. It's gone. [Bob panting] [Bob sighing] One, six... Yeah, I won. [Bob hushed cheering] Bobby, come on. Where can we talk? In the van. Where should we go? Galicia? [Bob panting] Oh, relax. I can't relax. What about the neighbours? Buy some new ones. [both laughing] 25 million smackers. And all 'cause that was your wedding day. Oh, we shall have to give her some of it. I imagine we will. You don't have to tell her, do you? It's not easy to hide 25 million smackers. You managed to hide me for four years. Oh Jesus, it's Norman from over the road. Wonderful. Get on the floor, quick. Well, you're out late. Emergency job. Fire risk. Chip shop. Generator. Well, don't let me keep you. [engine revving] [metal clattering] [piano music] How about it? Come on, in and out. Come on. If you tell her about the money, tell her about me at the same time. You reckon? Mm. It might soften the blow. I'm fond of her, Sue. I never said I wasn't fond of her. I better go home. Oh, Sue. Don't tell her a thing, for the moment. Why spoil it? Cash it in and keep your mouth shut. I'm the only one who knows. A mere million buys my silence? I always fancied being a kept woman. Diamonds. And plenty of 'em. Sue, I will tell her. I'm gonna tell her. And a flat in Kensington with a separate entrance for Grannie. Wend, I got two bits of news for you. Do you want the bad news first or the good news first? -[objects clattering] -[thief hushing] Here, a vid, Pete. [Wendy] Bob? Bob, is that you? Bob? [dog barking] Come on. -[dog barking] -[engine revving] Do you want the good news first or the bad news first? Bob. Did you get them? Get who? The burglars, of course. You what, burglars? They nicked the video. They what? [dramatic music] It's gone. I know, love, it's only- -They nicked it. -Bob. -They walked away with it. -Bob, it's only a video. It was on top of the video! What was on top of the video? We must call the police. We must dial 999. Bastards! Bastards! [both panting] Would anyone want this? Don't know. How filthy is it? Not filthy enough. Come on. How could they do this to me? Bob, it's only the video. Don't understand. They... What, love? They nicked my book. It was on the video. Was it a valuable book, sir? It was. It was... It was extremely valuable. Oh, I see, sir. Bob. Was it an antique, sir? Was it a first edition? I don't think it was a first edition. Bob. I must have the book back. You have to find the book. Yeah well, may I inquire the title of the work, sir? "The Gourmet Guide to Sex". It's of great sentimental value. Yeah, I quite understand that, sir. Bob, I do not think this is a conversation we should be having with the law. It is very, very important to me that I recover this book. Yes, sir. We'll bear that in mind. Yeah well, we can't promise anything, sir. You must seal off the area. Seal off the area, bring in the helicopters. You have to get that book back. Yeah, we'll do our best, sir. We'll leave no sex manual unturned. Madam. [bottles clanking] "The Gourmet Guide to Sex". What about it? -Fancy it? -Think I've gone beyond that. If you're hiding something from me... Yes, love? Don't. The thing is, I... I... I'm going out. I'm gonna comb the streets. Bob, you're still in your pyjamas. And allow your index finger to wander casually, but with great tenderness, towards his bottom. No. [David] Oh come on, George. It's only a bit of fun. After you with that, David. Allow your nipples- Something serious has happened. [Sue] What? Serious. We have to meet, now. [Sue] Have you told her? Have you told her about us? The common, now. I was looking for a video. Yeah? Yeah, you know, a cut price one. -Yeah. -Nicked. You know, stolen. Oh, you particularly wanted a stolen one, did you? Aye, that's it. What, you think they get better reception, do you? Well, I- Just 'cause I'm out on the street at three in the morning doesn't give every plain clothes copper in the water right to try and give me a hard bleeding time. Okay? Indeed. Fair enough, fair enough. This book is the property of Robert Whistler, 80 Becklands Grove, SW17. And its swift return will be appreciated. The wife and I have only got to page 12. Joke. If I brought this back to him, he might slip me a quid. What do you say? Sounds like he's fairly desperate for it. Yes. What's all this about? Have you told her about us? Oh, do me a favour. Well, in that case, may I ask why I'm stand- The ticket. It's been stolen. Oh my god. We have to look for it, now. We have to comb the streets now. Oh my god. [David coughing] Bob? What do you want? Mrs. Robert Whistler? What if I am? Is this your sex manual? Sh. I was under the impression that you and your husband would be keen to see this again. It's nearly five o'clock in the morning. I would imagine that is just the right sort of time for a book of this nature to come into its own. Are you drunk? If you wish to recover your property, I shall be available at my temporary residence, 35 Rectory Gardens, until tomorrow morning. Oh, bugger off. Although, I am in meetings pretty continuously. After that, I can be reached at Dean Market. If I haven't heard from you by then, I shall offer the volume you now see me holding for- Flush it down the love for all I care. [David] The market book stall when they open for business in a few hours time. [orchestral music] [trash rustling] Sue. [Sue] Oh, oh, oh. No. Oh, it's no good. Why are we bothering? It could be anywhere. You should have rung the hotline straight away. I would've made you ring the hotline. Yeah, well you wasn't there, was you? Well, I'm not married to you, am I? Oh, let's call it a day. I'll phone you in the morning. Bob. [Bob sighing] This hasn't changed us, has it? Don't know, love. -[birds chirping] -[soft piano music] [Bob gasping] Where have you been? Looking for the video. -Bob- -And the book. [Wendy sighing] Go on. Wend. What? Suppose something happened that meant I could change my life, I mean really change it. Do you mean something has? I mean, the only marriage guidance people like us can afford is a bank manager, isn't it? What are you on about? Well, we use words like love and all we mean is that we're scared to change, really. We're too poor and too small to think of anything else. Are you knocking off someone else, Bob? No. And if you ain't, are you saying it's only because you ain't rich? No. Money is not the issue, Bob. Our marriage is the issue. It's the only issue. Sure. Some drunk brought your precious sex manual back. What, where, where, where? -I told him to piss off. -What? He took it down to the book stall in Dean Market. Bob. Pyjamas. You're barmy. You're barmy, woman. Do you hear me? You're absolutely barmy. You have no consideration for anyone. I could've bought a chateau in France. I could've bought two chateaus. Bob, what are you talking about? I'm telling you nothing. From now on in. [dramatic music] Bob. I won the jackpot. 25 million and you just sent it down the Oxfam shop. 25 million quid. Oh, Bob, you haven't won, Bob. Who is she, eh? There's someone else, isn't there? [engine revving] [tyres screeching] Always on the go, your husband, eh? Who is our mystery jackpot winner? Could you be sitting next to the lucky person? Is there someone in your street who is worth 25 million pounds? The winner of Saturday's 25 million pound jackpot has still not come forward, a Holy Grail spokesman revealed at 3:00 a.m. Sunday morning. I won't use what else the poor bastard said about my waking him up to get the quote. The Globe wishes to let our readers in on the mystery winner's moment of supreme joy. That's what The Globe is all about. If any of your neighbours are acting suspiciously- -Well, isn't that a bit- -Get onto us now. Why so reticent, you lucky winner? Are you a Muslim? Despite opinions to the contrary, The Globe says there's nothing wrong with having a flutter. Allo wouldn't grudge you of that. Take out that last sentence? Get going on it. I'm doing a stint on the Sunday break at half-eight. It's lottery, lottery all the way. We have one guy who shot the other members of his syndicate for their share. A big winner? 200 quid. Wally, how much do we pay you? 50. It's not enough. [Wally laughing] Now where's them boots? Where's Dad? He had to go out. Are you and he okay, Mom? We will be, love. We will be. Will you? [Wendy] Listen, when you're our age, there's a lot of rubbish comes between you. What rubbish? Time, money, other people. [Wendy sighing] But... But what? If you love each other... I know I haven't got the ticket as well. But seriously, folks, the man who's done the most for the lottery is none other than Wally Whaley. So, Wally, a lottery edition of The Globe. How will you fill it? Oh, I'll have no trouble filling it, Amanda. I myself have already written 250,000 words on the subject of the lottery for national newspapers. That's the rough equivalent of "War and Peace". [Amanda chuckling] But what's in it for your readers, Wally? The lottery is life. It's you, it's me, it's the ups, it's the downs. It's glory and it's grovel. [Amanda] But is it actually true that you've changed your middle name to Lottery? Absolutely, Amanda. This is a subject of unique interest. For instance, this morning, we know that someone out there has won 25 million pounds. The computer told us that within hours of the closer play on Saturday night, but they haven't come forward yet. Now, the number is one, six, seven, eight, 19, 23. Does that number mean anything to you? Toss me a bit of paper and a pencil, Ben. Oh come on, Mom. [Wally] Eight, 19, 23. Maybe it's someone's birthday or National Insurance number or wedding day. Something lucky, anyway. Where's my boots then, Mom? In that order. What about one, 23, six, 19, seven, eight? Or one, 19, 23, eight, seven, six. Or 19, one, 23, seven, eight, six. Do you have a lottery story? Is there someone in your house who has a tale to tell about this amazing institution? Do you, perhaps, know or think you know who that mystery winner of the 25 million jackpot is? Think about it. 25 million pounds. Is the person you live with behaving oddly? Is there any little clue that might suggest that he or she is a lottery winner? What has the lottery meant to you? Has it meant heartache or triumph? Has it been a good laugh or has it brought you face to face with the futility of your existence? Call me, Wally Lottery Whaley of The Globe. On free phone, 0800 871 423. Do call. And keep those calls coming, because I am there for you. Mom? -Well, Wally I hope you find- -Mom, have you gone -lottery mad as well as him? -It's been great seeing you- Mom, is there nothing else in your lives? Where are my boots? [Amanda] And to all of you at home, be sure to check up on your- [engine revving] [Sue] Hello? Darling, I'm on my way to Dean Street. Some drunk found the book. It's in a bookstall in the market. Get there, I need to talk to you. Well, what's going on? I hid in the ticket in "The Gourmet Guide to Sex". Wend let some bastard carry it off there. [tyres screeching] [boxes crashing] Bastard, bastard, bastard. Why do you need to read "The Gourmet Guide to Sex"? Bastard. Can we please not start discussing our relationship? Can we get on with the business of getting our hands on 25 million quid? I thought it's got quite a lot to do with our relationship, Bob. You're beginning to sound like my wife. There's a lot more at stake here than human bloody relationships. [metal scraping] Did someone mention 25 million quid? Go and pick up faggings. I haven't got time to eat. I've got an urgent appointment. But they're meatballs. I think my neighbour is the mystery lottery jackpot winner. She bought eight tins of cat food this morning, and usually she makes the poor thing do with three tins a week. I must go. She's coming over. I think my husband's the mystery lottery jackpot winner. He's been coming home late recently and sometimes smelling quite strongly of alcohol. In 1983, he had an affair with a woman called Dorinda from his place of work. And though I forgave him, I've never been able to... I think I may be the mystery lottery jackpot winner. I have four of the numbers of the winning combinations on my ticket. Unfortunately, one of my dogs has eaten the other two numbers. If you wish to contact me, you may write to St. Anselm of all the angels. I think my boyfriend might be the mystery jackpot winner, he's about 6'2" tall. And his eyes are a kind of burnt umbery colour. He's also a warm and passionate lover. Last Tuesday, I wore cycling shorts in our bedroom. I let him peel them off my shapely buttocks and I gasped with pleasure as he turned me 'round- Hello, this is Wendy. Look, I saw you on the telly this morning and I wanted to ring because, well, the winning sequence spells out the date and time of our marriage. 23rd of June, 1978. And we got married at one on the dot. So, do you see? One, 23, six, 19, seven, eight. And my husband has been acting very, very strange. And this morning, he said something about the lottery and- Stay on the line. Hi, Wally Whaley here of The Globe. What you have to say is very interesting, Wendy. I gather from what you say he hasn't told you. Can you think of any reason why he might want to keep this news a secret? I don't know how to say this, Mister- Lottery, call me Lottery. We've been having... Marital difficulties? I don't know what to think. [Wally] Where are you now? Safeways in Westbury. I only have a break for half an hour but- Stand in the fore court, I'll be 'round. Don't move. Taxi. [dramatic piano music] [metal clanging] This is an invaluable book. And I have no wish to say goodbye to it. I have learned an amazing amount from it. And so, it is with great regret that I have decided to- Trade it in and buy another bottle of British wine. Precisely. 50 P. This country has grown cold and hard. [Bob grunting] Wally Lottery Whaley, lottery correspondent, Globe, lottery edition. Are you the lady who called me? I'm so confused. I just don't know what to think. It's okay, love. First of all, he says he hasn't got a ticket. Then he says he has. Then he says it's worth 25 million. Does he got another woman, I don't know. It's the lottery, love. It's heartache, it's ecstasy, it's joy, it's pain. It's all human life. Here. Do you like pie and mash? 75 because I'm sorry for you. Done. [crank creaking] So you think your husband might be involved with someone else, and if he is the jackpot winner, that's why he didn't tell you. I don't know though, do I? I never even knew he had a ticket. You see, Mrs. Whistler, all we have is the number of the ticket, but each ticket carries a retail number, and that tells you where it was issued. Then where was the 25 million ticket issued? My sources tell me it was issued at a place called the Two Cross Garage. But we were there on Saturday. We ran out, you see? Yeah? And? He must've bought it then. This is all very, very strange. The lottery is strange. It's all human life, Mrs. Whistler. It's triumph, it's despair, it's glory, it's grovel, it's- He has won it. It must be. That and the numbers and the way he was. And he never told me. Why wouldn't he want to share this wonderful news with you, Mrs. Whistler? And it is wonderful news, 25 million smackers. It's something we want to share with our readers as soon as humanly possible. Because he's having it off with some tart, that's why. I should've seen the signs. The phone rings, and when I pick it up, no one answers. And now she's getting her hooks into 25 bloody million. Mrs. Whistler, we are off the record at the moment, but I have to tell you, this is a great story. Market. We must get to the market. Bob's down at the market because of the sex guide. I think I might want to revise that adjective. This is an absolutely bloody amazing story. For world rights in your exclusive account of your joy to heartbreak and back again with full use of photographs and the right of signature... [metal clanging] [engine revving] You don't need that. No? "The Gourmet Guide to Sex", you don't need it. Don't I? It's a book for beginners. And if you'll excuse me saying so, you are obviously not a beginner. I'll take it. 10 quid. Keep the change. [engine revving] [tyres squealing] [Bob panting] I need to get hold of a book very, very urgently. Someone brought it and it's absolutely vital I get hold of this book. What book? I'll pay money, I'll pay any money, it doesn't matter. I'll give you anything you ask. I just need to get my hands on this book. It would help if you gave me the title. It's a reference book. It's called "The Gourmet Guide to Sex". I see. Is your marriage in crisis, then? I must have this book! You're too late, mate. I've sold it to the geezer over there. Oh. [percussive music] This is Nigel. [Woman] Hello, sweetness. Love you very, very much. Sorry, sorry, sorry. [engine revving] Come back. [dramatic music] [tyres squealing] [Sue panting] And what can I do for you? I need to get hold of a book. It's very, very urgent. Yeah? It is vital. And what is this book? "The Gourmet Guide to Sex". Are you with that geezer over there? I am. Well, I should ask him if I was you. You're the third in line. Huh? I shouldn't have thought you was in urgent need of a manual, darling. [dramatic music] Bobby, Bobby. Did you get it? It's in that car down there. -Come on. -Oh, go easy, Bobby. Remember, you can't prove it's yours. I'm easy. I'm very, very, very calm and collected and easy. [engine revving] [car horn honking] What kind of man is your husband? He's an ordinary guy. He's absolutely typical, is Bob. You know what I mean? He could be anyone. But I don't mind that. I mean, I wasn't looking for a romantic hero. But maybe that's become a problem in our marriage. Bob never shows emotion. And I think because we've never talked enough, I'm beginning to wonder if I ever really knew him. Do you know what I mean? [Wally] I certainly do, my darling. [Wendy] He never really shows his feelings for me. This isn't just about the fact that he bought a lottery ticket with a jackpot number on it and he hasn't told me. It's about him and me. He never really shows strained emotion. [players cheering] Ben, what are you doing? Give us the book, you horrible, little yuppy bastard. Give us the book or I'll break both your arms, -I swear I will. -Calm down. Well, he certainly seems attached to it. [Bob] We have to play this very, very carefully. -Janeybee. -I'm in the bedroom. Just a minute. I'll be ready in five minutes. Good. Well done, you. -[toy gun firing] -What are you doing? Daddy's buys, Damon. Damon, go and play with lovely gun. What's that book? [toy gun firing] What do you see? Just a little boy with a gun. Huh? I could go in and say I was collecting for charity. I could say do you happen to have any old books in the house such as, for example- "The Gourmet Guide to Sex"? [Bob sighing] Or we just break the door down and threaten him with crowbars. Bobby. We've got to be very calm about this. And we're going to get the ticket back. Right, love. We may not be a syndicate, but we make a nice couple, eh? Has a man been here about a book? We have to get hold of him. Yeah. This is very, very important. Is that right? It's crucial we get hold of him. This book, it wouldn't by any chance be "The Gourmet Guide to Sex" would it? Has a man been here after it? A man and a woman, in fact. Where is she? Hang on, hang on. Are you some kind of wife-swapping group? Wally Lottery Whaley, lottery correspondent, Globe, lottery edition. We need to find this book. It is very, very urgent. If I were you, mate, I should go up and have a nice wank. I can offer you money, a great deal of money. If you get it back, you get all that money, what's the first thing you'll do? I'll tell her. Well, don't you want me to? What, tell her about us, you mean? I was thinking about the money. Oh. Do you think I'm here for the money, is that it? Of course not. Why have I been here for the past four years? Why have you been here for the past four years? Because I'm in love with you, that's why. It's changed you already. Even the thought of it's changed you. You look all suspicious. You were never suspicious. Maybe I need counselling. Do you think they offer counselling for people who've won the jackpot and then lost the ticket? [both chuckling] You're beyond counselling, Bobby. Large amounts of Valium and a straight jacket is what's called for. I wonder what the bastard's up to. What are you doing? What do you think I'm doing? [Janeybee] I'm ready, darling. -[toilet flushing] -You play. Why? I'm ready for you. I got a book, darling. A special book. He's gonna disappear. With whoever she is. You can do anything with money, can't you? Everything's forgiven if you've got money, isn't it? It's what the lottery's all about, Wendy. [Wendy sighing] We started, he and I, not getting on when I went back to work four years ago. And that was for money. 'Cause we needed the money. I don't want money. I want him. What the hell do you think you're doing? Oh, sorry. Habit. [phone ringing] Hello? [Ben] What are you doing with my mom, you bastard? Nothing. We're watching you. Keep your hands off her or else. Who was that? [Wally] Some nutter. I can't bear it any longer. What are you gonna say? I'll think of something. [doorbell ringing] They're busy. I need to talk to your dad. It is very, very urgent. And now, you sort of lift your behind. And cock your left leg, as far as I can see. I thought I heard the bell. They'll go away, sweetness. It's no good pressing the bell. -Listen- -I've got a paper plane. [Damon mimicking engine whirring] Where did you get that? You shan't have it. [doorbell ringing] It's the doorbell, darling. I know it's the doorbell. It might be Mommy. I don't care if it's Virginia Bottomley. [doorbell ringing] Why didn't you tell them to go away? I did. They wanted to have a go at my plane, but they can't. This will seem an extraordinary request, -I know, but- -My plane can fly away. [dramatic music] Wee. Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, Jesus Christ almighty. [soft orchestral music] Bob. Look. After him. [phone ringing] -Oi. -Hey. [Bob] Hey. -[phone ringing] -Come back. -Mrs. Whistler- -If she's with him, she might pick up the phone. -Wendy- -I want to know what I'm dealing with. Once I know what I'm dealing with, then I will deal with it. But if I don't know what it is with which I'm dealing, then how can I deal with it? You are dealing, Mrs. Whistler, with 25 million pounds. [feet stamping] [both panting] Back to the van. [phone ringing] You got kids? You got a wife? Two. Two wives, two kids. And are they worth 25 million? Well, one's worth a lot more. And the other isn't worth 25 P, in my opinion. I've got one husband and one son, and they're worth more to me than anything. Wally, this is off the record. Oh come on, you bastard, answer. [phone ringing] -Mom? -Ben? Where are you? How did you get this number? [phone ringing] -[engine revving] -[tyres squealing] -There. -[phone ringing] Ben, I am not having an affair with anyone. Where are you? A phone box. [Wendy] Go home and wait for me there, okay? Has Dad won? Well, we think he may have won the jackpot. How did you know? What will you say if she answers? I shall be very, very polite. Who are you with, Mom? He called you darling. Is he your lover? No, he is not the other man in my life, Ben. He is a lottery correspondent. Now go home and wait for me there, okay? And I'll- Ben, your mom is a fine woman, a fine, fine woman. He hung up. Why would he do that? [car banging] [phone ringing] Shall I answer it? No. It could be the wife. [phone ringing] Bob, if you don't answer it, she really will suspect. If you're so keen to talk to her, you bloody talk to her. Sue, Sue? Hello? [Wendy] Who's that? Mr. Whistler's assistant. He hasn't got an assistant. He has now. Wendy, hi. Where are you? Who's that with you? I had to hire a, you know... Bob, if you want me to be here when you get home tonight, then we have to talk. Now you tell me where you are. I'll be at... You want her to know? Is that it, Bob? Is that what you want? I'm fed up with lying. If that's what you want. I'll be at the Southwest London Islamic Cultural Centre, 10 Gatton Road, SW17. I need to talk to you, urgent. How long will you be there? Ask him if he's got the ticket. Is there someone there with you, love? Yeah, Sylvester Stallone and the Chippendales. Oh, and Melvyn Bragg in his underpants. You tell your girlfriend that I'm coming right over and you tell her that I recognise her voice. I do too, I know that voice. That's someone I bloody well know. I know it is. Where now, darling? The Southwest London is... I know your experiencing this is painful, Mrs. Whistler, but I want you to know that in 30 years of journalism, I've never been privileged to be as close as this to a real human drama. Drive. -[engine revving] -[percussive music] -[car horn honking] -[tyres squeaking] [phone ringing] -Mom? -Ben? [Ben] Are you with your boyfriend? No, I am not doing it in the car with a lottery correspondent. You talk to him. Ben? We'll be at the Southwest London Islamic Cultural Centre, 10 Gatton Road, SW17. And, Ben, your mother is a fine woman. He hung up. [dramatic music] -This must be it. -[turn signal clicking] [speaking in foreign language] Okay? We better get to work. I'll tell you what, I'll forego the flat for Grannie. We're almost there, Bobby. Come on. [speaking in foreign language] [Bob sighing] We'll get the ticket, then everything else will fall into place. But where have you heard her voice? I can't think. Was it a neighbour? He'd never do it with one of the neighbours. He hates the neighbours. What I can't understand is why she'd use the time and date of our marriage as the numbers. Does that mean he still loves me? Think he had this bird tucked away somewhere. And all the time, this money's given him the chance to think that he can scarper. I knew the reason he stayed with me was me wages. And Ben, of course. He loves that boy. Oh, Ben, Ben, Ben. What are we doing to you? What the bloody hell has happened to our marriage, Wally? Why is the only thing these days work and money? Whatever happened to love, you know? What are we doing for Ben? Not a great deal. What are you doing? Playing with my dart. [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] There's a 25 million jackpot, did you hear? Apparently, it hasn't been claimed. [Woman] The winning jackpot combination is one, six, seven, eight, 19, 23. I'll show it to my husband. [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] We have found a lottery ticket. Aziz had it. [speaking in foreign language] [Muslim Woman] I think it is the winning combination. [speaking in foreign language] It is 25 million pounds. What does Islamic law say on the subject of gambling? I forget. Then I suggest you make an effort to remember. Throw this ticket away. It is a thing of no importance. Very well [speaking in foreign language]. What do you suppose they're doing with it? We'll have to be quick. She'll be here soon. [knuckles cracking] Oh. This needs very careful thought. I could pretend to be a Muslim. I could be a Muslim. No. Aziz, I would like to talk to you upstairs. Oh tell us, is it the winning combination? He said I must throw it away. -What? -Oh. [muttering in foreign language] Now, Aziz, I am going to ask you to do something very important. Yes, Mother. [speaking in foreign language] Yes, Mother. Look, she's holding the numbers to the window. [Bob] Maybe she's raffling it. Do you know what the lottery is? Yes, Mother. I see it with Anthea Turner. We try to make you a good Muslim, and you watch Anthea Turner? And "Home and Away". Yes, it is very difficult to resist, I know. This ticket is worth 25 million pounds, and your father says we must throw it away. I'll throw it away. Far away from temptation. You are a good boy, Aziz. May I have the ticket? Hey. Where's he off to? Now's our chance. [engine revving] -Charlie, it's Az. -Yeah. Listen, if I got the jackpot lottery ticket, -where would I cash it in? -You couldn't, Az. You're only 12. You gotta be 16. You could pass as 16. You got into "Four Weddings and a Funeral". Hello there. Hello. Down there. I think you may have something of mine, young man. No. I think you may. It's the girl in the garage. I never thought of it. Why did I never think of it? What girl in what garage? The girl who sold him the ticket. Mrs. Whistler, I have lived all my life for this story. Nice for you. See, I dropped that ticket. It's my ticket. I think you'll find it's mine. I'm going to Anthea Turner. -Look just- -Mother. [speaking in foreign language] These people are trying to kidnap me. -What are you on about? -Help, help, kidnap, help. What's happening here? This boy has my lottery ticket. It's worth 25 million smackers. We're not messing about here. Get it. Did someone say 25 million pounds? [speaking in foreign language] You greedy bastard. Stop this hideous racket. Rescue me, Uncles. -This man's trying to kill me. -Here. -Bob. -[Bob shrieking] Wend. Bobby. Bobby? After them. [percussive music] [speaking in foreign language] Why did you do it? Buy the ticket, you mean? You know what I mean. I am not talking about some lottery. Well, I am. [orchestral music] Mom. Dad. [orchestral music] What's that, then? -One of them lottery tickets. -Oh, them. I never win. I don't. I'm not lucky. I've never been lucky. Me neither. [orchestral music] What do you think you're doing with my husband? Same as you, chasing a lottery ticket. Mr. Whistler, I'd like to ask you some questions. Were you brought up in London? Is this the first time you bought a lottery ticket? Who the hell are you? Wally Whaley, lottery correspondent of The Globe. Pleased to meet you. [Bob wheezing] Can we stop discussing the lottery and start discussing what this woman thinks she's doing here? Mom, Dad. How long has this been going on? Four years. Four years? [orchestral music] If I get hold of that ticket first, I'm gonna take it down to the lottery headquarters on my own. They were my numbers. It was my wedding! Why do people still litter? It's a lottery ticket, darling. How very dull of it. It might be the winning one. Darling, if it were the winning ticket, some ghastly little oi could be handing it into the lottery HQ even as we speak. Let us find a bin and put it in. What was the winning numbers for yesterday's jackpot? One, six, seven, eight, 19, and 23. It'll never come up again. You never know. [feet stamping] It's a dead end. It must be here somewhere. If we all search, we'll be bound to find it. [grate creaking] What would one do with 25 million pounds, one wonders? God knows. Swimming pools, one imagines. And such vulgar things. Just a meaningless slip of paper. Rubbish. Litter. [trash rustling] Here you are. It had flown back that way. [Wendy] Ben. Who wants it? Or shall I keep it? I'm just 16. I could do a lot with 25 million. Ben, give that here. Money, money, money. That's all you bloody care about, isn't it? What about feelings, eh? What about your family, eh? [all shouting] A lottery ticket is a bearer bond and possession is rather more than nine points of the law. Pint of best, please. And yes, I am 18. You see, if I lose a fiver in the street, I can't prove it's mine. It belongs to whoever picks it up. Now, this ticket could be the 25 million jackpot. Though why anyone should be so insanely greedy as to want 25 million, I can't imagine. Could I have a look at that? Sorry? I've never seen one before and I'm interested in the lottery. [Woman] Go on, darling. Such a sweet boy. Can you leave it out? This is mine, okay? Oh, Bob. What has happened to you? I think I've had enough, Bob. I think we might be through. Wend? That ticket is the property of Southwest London Islamic Culture Centre and the proceeds from it ought to be used for charitable purposes. Six, seven, eight, 19, 23. -Interesting, that. -That's the jackpot number. That ticket's worth 25 million. Stop, thief, stop. Stop, thief, stop, thief. Ben. Wend. Bob. -This is obviously a trick. -Yeah, yeah. [speaking in foreign language] Bastards. [orchestral music] Ben. I'm sorry. Your dad and I. What about us? How could you do this, Bob? Why did you do this? I don't know, love. I'm sorry. I feel set up, Bob. I feel so let down. I'm sorry, love. Oh. What's happening here? [speaking in foreign language] Has got two wives and they don't get on. That's always the problem with wives. May I ask what you intend to do with the money? Will it change your life? You can't leave me, Wend. I love you. You have a very funny way of showing it. Bobby? I just got tangled up with Sue. It never altered what I felt about you. Bobby. You and her and all that money. You was just gonna go off, weren't you? Forget about the money. The money doesn't matter. Oh yeah? This is nothing. -[ticket ripping] -[crowd gasping] Say you won't leave me. Say you'll never leave me. Okay, I'll never leave you. But you didn't have to chuck away 25 million to get me to say that. Well, that's what I did. Bobby, why? Love. He's torn up the ticket and divorced the young one. I suppose we should go home. He's a lunatic. All Englishmen are lunatics. Where's my ticket? What have you bastards done with my ticket? It is in little pieces. And by the way, please do not refer to us as bastard. It is an offensive term. Bastards. This is a great story. I don't care who says what. This is a great day for British lottery journalism. Bastards. [man sobbing] [sombre piano music] Bobby, you can't go. Not just like that. Bobby, please don't go. Bobby, please. Darling, come to Mommy. Oh, good darling. I knew you shouldn't have. Excuse me. I'm Wally Whaley, lottery correspondent- Oh, why don't you piss off? Lottery edition of The Globe. Our readers would be very interested in your story and I can offer money, a great deal of money. [sombre music] You are a very, very stupid man. I know this. I'm gonna make your life a misery. I know this. How could you do it? 'Cause I love you. [Wendy sobbing] I think you've suffered enough. Oh you do, do you? I've got this ticket, and it has the jackpot number on it. Oh, please don't make stupid jokes. I had a ticket made up for this week's lottery with the same numbers. That's the one Dad tore up. This is the real winning ticket. [Bob] Benjamin. [orchestral music] [Wally] It's the lottery. It's life. It's the ups. It's the downs. It's the glory. And it's the grovel. There's heartache and there's ecstasy. There's joy and there's pain. It's strange, the lottery. It's all human life. It's absolutely bloody amazing. [Bob laughing] [flame whooshing] [orchestral music] [Narrator] It might be you.
