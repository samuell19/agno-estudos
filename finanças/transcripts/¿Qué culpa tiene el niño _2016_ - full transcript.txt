I have a master's degree in Social Development. A graduate! So older that my little Renato. You like them new. Catch boys. No, not for that, ma'am. You have no idea how neighbors walk upon it. Therefore, I always tell you, if you walk fornicate, - Use a condom. - Well, I should say more often because sometimes he forgets. Do not tell me that ... - Lucky! - No, not even thinking. - No way, ma'am. "I thought he was still a virgin." You do not, my Renato. He never tells me anything, you know? I'll give you some advice, from woman to woman. It does not suit you to walk behind him. You will not get anything. Men do not do it, my dear. You show them a little interest, and they use and throw away. That's what happened to his father, when I was younger. We were always in a shabby hotel. There on Alvaro Obregon Street. - Hotel Nice, you know? - No, I have not had a chance yet. You do not lose anything. There are better ones. So, the bastard ... was married with two children. Small. You should have heard him, always promising me that she was going to get a divorce. That his wife did not understand him and that I was the love of his life. Used to call me little grapes. But it was my fault, you know why? Because everything he wanted from me, it was sex! And one day, I said, "So will you?" I'm pregnant then. Well, it looks like family. Hey, Mom. Shit! I thought it was someone else. Maru! Wait! Wait, Maru. Can I help you? Anything. You're not even done yet high school. No way! You live with your mother. That was all I needed. - Wait, see. - Do not touch me! - What do you want? - I? V l . You came to my quest. and suddenly you get up and leave. What? How did you know where I live? Your friend, the drug dealer, told me. And get dressed! You think it's all good? "Deplorable, my friend. - I was taking a shower. Wait. Let's go inside, I dress and then we can talk. Do not worry, I'll tell you here. I'm pregnant. What? - Congratulations. - Congratulations? Are you that bad? No, not bad. Screw it! Maru, wait. If there's anything I can do. Thank you! How dear! Seriously? No, we've never met. or we cross, no ... I do not want to see you again. Why not? Why? Why next time You should listen to your mother. and use condoms. Asshole! You know what? Do me a favor. What did you think? "Shall I get the rich?" Do not shit gold!

Sorry, that ... ... start the two by 55-44 ... ... 23-78-82. - But I do not have a balance. - What? I have no balance. Do not worry. I borrowed it 100 pesos to my mother. Do not worry. I know where you live. You really blew it. You went to an uninvited wedding, and swept away! You stayed with the most touring girl. of the party and ... Do not laugh! You took advantage of me. You came to my room. and you fucked me without me knowing and then you disappeared. You're a fag. Like your father! How do you know my father is like this? ABORTION INFORMATION An abortion is easier. I do not agree. This is my opinion. Daniela, she will not have a baby. of any guy which she does not even know. He does not go to class, you do not have a job, you're stupid. He lives with his mother, a madwoman. Next time, you'll see who you get into. - What a bitch. Seriously? - Why? And how did it go with the Brazilian? - Ol . - Ol . Dani. I was looking for you. He is not Brazilian, Argentine. AND? And it was this weekend which I ended up with Adrian. Because. He saw an opening and fucked you. You were back with him on Monday, were not you? Yeah, he never betrays Adrian. - Never. - Hello. Can we talk, Maru? Juan Pablo, what are you doing here? Well, I leave you. You have a lot to talk about, right? Think about what you're going to do, Maru, and ... And he would ask Juan Pablo for advice. "About what?" - She told you. Maru, call me. Whatever you decide, I support you. - Thank you, Pau. - I'm not talking to you. You have nothing to do with this. You do not see. Can I sit down? - Seriously, man. - Thank you? You did not tell me, asshole. You fucked Maru. Damn it, man. You really screwed up! And what are you going to do? I'm a man, right? I'll run back. No way! Do not you understand? - What? - I'm going to be a father. Well, give a pass to celebrate. A father. Do you know where Maru lives? I'm thinking what I'm going to tell you, man. "What can I say?" - That's right! That's it! That you thought about it. To give you a chance. That you're going to take care of the kid. Introduce yourself safe, responsible, asshole. And then, you moved to her house. D to imagine? He must have two maids, man. To make you quesadilhas and take you to bed. No washing clothes or making the bed. Her parents probably I'll buy you a car, man. - I do not think so. - As well? And after you gain confidence ... invite me to watch the games. No. Wait. - No, not even skirts. - What's his? Your son's wife with another. This is not good, man. Please give me another chance. I swear, I will not disappoint you. You should have thought of that. before you go to Cuba. No, Maru.

I'm going to blow you up, asshole! What a disappointment TO RECRIMINATE ME FOR CUBA, While going to bed WITH A MISS! YOU'RE A SWAN, I'M INTERESTING! LEAVE ME ALONE! Maru, wait. DO NOT DO THAT! THE BABY IS NOT GUILTY! - What are you doing here? - We can talk? - Maru, look what I bring. - What a shame! What are you doing with this? How do you know where I work? What are you doing? What's the matter with you? - Maru, do not get excited. "Sister, what a shame. - Give us a chance, shall we? - Us? Who or what? How so who? To me. To our son. Listen, you show up here again. and I ask Plutarch to get you another black eye. You got it? - Fucking stalker! - Why? - Plutarch! - Girl, please ... - Please, will you? - Yeah, do not worry. Maru, think carefully, okay? Calm down, you fucker, okay? And keep it that way, man. so it works with women. We're still on time. The fetus is growing, with you. And how will that be? I'll have to stay hospitalized or ... No. I'll be right here in the office. Quick, no more than half an hour. And if all goes well ... As well? Well, it's an intervention and there's always risk. It's minimal, but h . Is everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine. Preferably, bring your mate on that day. To be more relaxed. I do not have a boyfriend. Do not you have one to introduce me? No, you're old. I'd better bring a friend. Okay, milestone when? - Time is running out. - Yes. - Are not you going to cooperate? - Can I have a pass? - Since when do you smoke? - Impulse.. - Give me a break. - No. - There's one. - No, you're gonna drool over all this. - Here, take one. "Just a pass, nothing more. I'll talk to Francisco later. Maru, what are you doing? Do not smoke, it's bad for the baby! Look at her, all wild. I do not even know who he is. He's turning, is not he? All right, calm down. Everything will work out. You know, I thought and I'd rather ... enter alone. - You are sure? - No, follow me! Maru ... - Please, listen to me. - No, let me see ... Please, listen. There's still time ... Sorry, you've gone too far. This is not funny. - Do not do it. - I'm serious. Maru ... Hey, save her. Over there That's what I was told. No, just like you do not want me to abort? I was not able. What? I did not dare. - So, our son is ... - Right here! Come here! What do you mean, our son? I got it on my belly, you asshole. "Ranita, you're alive, son! - What's the matter with you? - I'm your father. - Get off me! I'm going to be a father! - I love you both. - No, shut up. Nobody loves anyone here! Or I'll be back soon! - I'm going to abort. - Do not say that. Our son will hear that. They already feel things. - Goes into. - Is your mother home? Your mother-in-law? It is not. She's not my mother-in-law. He had taken her. Renato, you and I need to have a serious conversation. She's your mother-in-law. You lucky one! - Shit! - Seriously, man. And when are you moving to her house? I do not know, We have not talked about it yet, but ... soon, I think. This time she was even different, as... very sweet. Having the baby one thing, but this does not mean that I want Something with you, alright? Very well, man. It's a question of time. She's already fallen! Yes, we were talking about our future. It was spectacular. We do not have a future as a couple, so do not get ideas. Will you have more children? I think so. I mean, she still did not say yes, but ... d to feel it. You may believe so! They're connected! the universe. Shit! Did you choose the godfather? No. We still do not talk about it. Well, I'm available, man. If you want, I can ... "That would be spectacular. - Without commitment. No, of course. Done! Compadres, man! Fix it! Now we just need the godmother. Because there are always two, "But she chooses." - Clear. Yes, she chooses. It could be, I do not know, somebody, and we could get the four of them out. The four on the spree! To party! It could be Dani or Pau. Or does she have an even better friend? I do not know. I do not think so. Let it be Dani, then. He's very good. Remember that red dress What did she wear at the wedding? Dude, she was not wearing suti . I gave you a few, did not you? No way, my girlfriend's friend! It's decided! She will be the comadre. What are you going to do with him? - Why do not you give him a chance? - What kind of hypothesis? - After all, he's the father. "Never mind, Paulina. How could he? Worth trying. If he is irresponsible, you end it. Stop stuffing yourself, Paulina. Stop talking about nonsense. You can not marry him. I do not plan on marrying him. - No, it's not bullshit. - I'm not saying they get married. - What's your idea? - They could live together. - What? There, he's handsome. There you go! You would have a feast to the eyes every day like a sensual girl. And you will be one, you deserve it. There, the baby's gonna be cute. - And that's important. - Please! And on purpose, what the deputy And the first lady have to say? Where did you meet this young man? His name is Renato. Cad ver's best friend. - Take off the coat. - Why? The Cad ver? Friend of Arthur. The one who married Lau. - I met him at the wedding. - We met at the wedding. The Cad ver. With such a nickname I do not think it's reliable. Of course , m e. Cad ver is a cool guy. - No? - Yes, a lot. And what about the celebration, mi da? You rarely eat with us. You're acting strangely, are not you? Dad! It's just a friend. I just wanted to introduce you. Calm. So they're friends, right? I'm happy because you look like me very new to my daughter. - The paneleiro, Renato? - Julian! Of course not, sir. Never in life! Since my daughter says who are only friends and such Cad ver ... I do not know if you know, but she has a boyfriend. - I do not have a boyfriend. - Stop it. You'll go back to him. - I'd rather die, honey. "Then a fool, because Juan Pablo is a good boy and of good families. And a very good lawyer. with career ahead. I'll take you on my campaign. Make great speeches, you have no idea. Yeah, look, he sent me one. "Hello, bitch, I hope you enjoyed it. to fuck with the little larilas. " You "You'll probably go to catch a disease. I wish I'd never met you. Burn in hell, you whore. " The can of this guy, I swear ... I have more speeches from him if you want. Why did this asshole write that? Because he's the father, and because ... Renato and I are going to have a baby. - What? - I'm pregnant. Eats. Enjoy your food. He's so new. Not really. It will grow, will not it? How will he sustain you? What are you going to live for? He will not support me, boy. Let's live apart. What do you mean, separate? What are you talking about, Maria Eugenia? Ma, I'm not marrying him. I made one mistake, I will not make another. He just wanted to be known. That was not a good idea. No. Why? My God, why? What have I done to deserve this? - What did I do? - M e, you're exaggerating. Did you take your pills? Why did not you take the pill? Clearly, no, no, no, no, no! I told him. How did it happen? How did this happen? Shall I tell you what it was like? Yes. No! Because your daughter would kill me. But how could Maru choose you? I have my charm. - How old are you? - Twenty one. "Twenty-one, sir." - Twenty one? Shit! Are you at least studying? - At the University? - I 'm working on it ... - I do not understand! - There were some problems with a teacher and caught up with me! He did not like me and he failed me. Therefore, for the year, I'm going to university. So, um, how about some vadiolas? - Do not be mean. What are you doing? - Do you have a job? - Now? - Yes now. What you do? - I'm in a sabbatical year. Never took a sabbatical? But this situation changes everything, right? The pregnancy, the baby. I'm going to university, sir. And I'll start working now to save, you see? It's all right. Do not worry. What kind of job will you get? You did not even finish high school, asshole! Shit! This is worse than I thought. It's not that bad. Hi, two pizzas. - Hello. - Marusita, Come here for a second, little girl. What is up? Sit down, we want to talk to you. So, my dear, Your father and I spoke about your situation and ... and we think the best thing to do is Forget that boy. - Renato. - As you wish. What happened was a mistake. I will be responsible. Do not worry, I do not a life with him. Calm down. Still good, my dear. In this case, you can join Juan Pablo immediately. - What? "It will be the best for you, Maru. The sooner the better, No one needs to know. What are you talking about? Do not intend have the baby alone, do not you? - But Juan Pablo is not his father. - As well? For me, it's very clear that . Yes I agree. - I do not believe this. - Maru, please. You confused the dates. That's how we get rid of it. Aliens, it's good that he went to Cuba. - Dad, what's wrong with you? - V l , Maru, we're in the elections. A scandal means fewer votes. Yes or no? Daughter... - What's it? - Senator, it seems the groom, stand out, well, the suitor, well, your boyfriend ... What? What are you doing here? Nobody sent pizzas. - No? - I know what? You're such a fool. What's it? I came to see your daughter. Listen, I have an offer for you. I'll give you money and you forget my daughter. - What do you think? - No way. For your benefit. It will be a good tip. You sign a contract to say that you will never see. And he already is. You can deliver pizzas all over town, - as is foreseen in your future. "Who do you think I am?" I will fight to stay with Maru and my son. You do not have any kids, asshole. Get the hell out of here, right away. Why do you treat me like that? I am your son-in-law. - In your dreams, fool. - As you wish. But I am the father of that child, and I do not renounce it. Listen, enchanted prince, You're not welcome in our humble home. Do not like you My wife does not like you, My daughter does not like you. Even Boris, the dog, does not like you. You're a man! You have dignity, fool. What's the matter with you? Why do you say that? - Go inside. - Why do you say that to him? Come back inside, Maru. - Maru. - Let's go. - At where? - Let's go. Get on the bike. Maru, do not go up to this motorcycle. No? V s . You're not wearing a helmet. Yeah, here's the helmet. P e. Maria Eugenia, you're alive! Do not be irresponsible, please! PIZZA CENTER Hold on tight! Renatito, I told you to use a condom. What are you going to do? As well? Let's have the baby. I'm going to open an account with my salary. And I work too, and I'm doing well, so ... That's good, daughter, because I do not think Renato can support you. No, that's not the point, ma'am. And where will you live? - We 're dealing with this. - We see, yes. You know you can live here, son. But let me tell you something. But you have to help with the expenses. - I can not handle everything. "Thank you, madam, thank you. But I will stay in my house and Renato will be here with you. This is not going to change, do not worry. Whatever you decide. I will not interfere with you. I'm going to bed, I'm very tired. Give me the coccyx. It's fine. You can have dinner if you want. "Thank you, ma'am. - Thanks, Mom. If you want to sleep here, I do not mind. Close the door and do not make a sound, okay? They do not need to show what others do not have. Do not be mean. Maru, come on! - No, tomorrow, please. - Come on! I want to go to bed. I'm tired and I have a meeting in the morning. Please. Maru, your father is talking to you. "What is it now?" - What are you going to do? I do not know. I do not know what to do. I need to think. Well, you do not have much time, daughter. Maru, reconsider Juan Pablo. M e, this is not going to happen. Are you crazy? No. So do not leave me another alternative. - What are you saying? - You have to get married. - with the pizza boy. - What? - It's not cool, is it? - Well, no. Were you taken by surprise, daughter? Maru, you can not be single. I'm not going to marry him or with whom. What's the matter with you? Back to Juan Pablo and it ends with just being to marry the other. - Nor one neither the other! - Either one, choose! What if I do not want it? What? I do not know, we can take the funds from the Foundation. - As? - You can not do that. Of course I can. And I can make things worse. You know that very well. So do you. I've been working on this project for a year. You can not do this to me, Dad. What does my job have to do? with this? M e, please. That's what I said, daughter. What's this got to do with? with those poor children? Without help, abandoned, with bleeding eyes ... Inhuman, daughter. Inhuman. Please, think about it, my dear, before you start to notice. I do not believe this. No, I do not believe it! Maria Eugenia, come on! Think well! And when you decide let me know "That's extortion, Maru. - I know. - What can I do? - Tell him to bugger. Do you know how many children the Foundation supports? Yes, but marry a guy. You know it's not the best option ... There, your marriage would look like with a first communion. Is the guy really tough? Because it does not. Worse than that. Case with me and I end up living in "Vila Mis ria" with his mother, the stripper . And on! How horrible. Perhaps... I have to marry you Yes, it's fine. Perfect. No problems! - In two weeks... - Hear me! My parents are forcing me. That's why I'm doing it. Because if I do not marry you I call into question many things and could not even buy milk for the baby. Why? You work, me too. - We're in this together. - Do not say silly. Listen. I work in a Foundation. which helps children in need. We live on donations of several organizations. And my father. one of the biggest sponsors. If he takes the money, the children are homeless hungry, including ours. And we can not feed it with pizza, Why not? - No, I do not think so. - No, of course not. That's why I've been thinking. And I think it's a good idea. if we become partners. - What do you mean, partners? - Yeah, people. We signed a contract. Some call it "marriage." But that does not interest me. It means nothing to you. - There's nothing between us. "Wait a minute, Maru. I do not understand. Because you come here, you wait for me, you say you love me What do you want to marry me? Wait. I did not say I loved you. I'm not expecting you. By a great chance, you got me pregnant. And now we have to get married. That's it! This is the result of transient madness mixed with lots of shit. So do not be confused. If I do it, out of interest. And not necessarily for you. Are you okay? Rays! Rays! You're breaking my heart, really. V l ! How many times did I tell you? Stop the shit, Maru. Partners? Partners. - Partners! - I'll think about it. - You thought? - I'm thinking. Partners! That's bullshit! - What should I do? - Have a great party. As in Acapulco. The ocean, the beach, a couple of miles. Seriously, man. What should you do? Is not this your dream? Being with an older girl like Maru? Yes, but not so against her will. Not like partners. What the hell is that? Calm down, man, she is making herself difficult, but d to see the miles, that she's interested in you. - You think so? - They're all the same, man. And you know the best part? You told him you were going to think. Do you know what I did not like? She said we would live apart. So, why marry? Fights. Let me see. You did not say that parents Are they conservative? They will never accept it. - I will not, will I? - I said no. Line up her game and ver s. But do not pay him too much attention. Just ignore it. Do you think Maru just wants to use me? Damn it, Frog.
