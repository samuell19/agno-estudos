[English subtitles are available.] I, Li Zhuifeng, have been a soldier for more than 30 years. I have expanded the territory for the Divine Land. People call me the God of Warfare. Today, we are trapped in Beipo by tens of thousands of Shamans. I have failed you. You are all good warriors. Now, in the face of death, cry if you really can’t help it. Your tears are allowed tonight. Commander, something’s up. [Beipo City] Commander. It looks like Shamans have gained more forces. From their campfire, there are around a hundred thousand of them. Perfect. Impasse Rescue Good. I’m surprised that the lords are able to arrive here so swiftly. We heard that you have trapped Li Zhuifeng, the God of Warfare. That’s why we rushed here with our warriors. Same here. I was afraid that if we got here late, we wouldn’t have a share of Li Zhuifeng’s flesh after we slaughtered them. Bottoms up! Are you all full already? Yes. If you are full, let’s go. You eight people should leave via the 4 gates. Report our situation to General Huang Zizai in Gandang. Tell him, Tell him, my son, we are all depending on you. What are you laughing at? He is my son-in-law. Am I not allowed to call him that? Yes! Come on, repeat what I said. My son, we are all depending on you. Good. Open the gate. Your Majesty, riders are leaving Beipo from the four gates. Your Majesty, are they breaking through the encirclement tonight? How many people are there? Eight riders and eight horses. Ok. They are truly the warriors of the God of Warfare. Yah! Commander, we have only one person left. Don’t worry. That’s what I say. Once he is a rival of mine, he mustn’t be a foolish man. Tell everyone to sleep well. Shaman won’t try to attack within the next ten days. General Huang, when Commander Li went into battle, he asked us to wait for his update. But now, we can’t do nothing. You can read like I do. You. What’s wrong with Commander Li? My son, we are all depending on you. Ok. Great. Where is Commander Li? Beipo. They are trapped by 100 thousand Shamans. 100 thousand. Take him. Bury him well. Let’s go. Hang on, where are you going? We are going to their aide, of course. Beipo is an abandoned city. It’s tiny with poor defense, no soldier and no food. Commander must be helpless over there. Let me ask you. How many warriors do we have? 5000 cavalries and 20 thousand infantries. Do you know that 100 Shaman cavalries can surround 10 thousand people. 1000 of them can go up to 100 kilometers long. They travel like lightnings and thunder. We only have 20 thousand warriors. How are we able to defeat so many Shamans? Huang Zizai, What do you mean by this? Don’t save them! What? [God of Warfare] Before the Commander left, he gave me this token to command the city. Order to all warriors, if anyone suggest us to send out relief, he’ll be punished by martial law. Yes. Leave. Rush to the East City and hand this to the Warfare division. Noted. 100 thousand. Yanqu. What an ungrateful bastard! My father betrothed me to you before he left. And you are letting him die out there? Yanqu, listen to me. What is there to say? You are waiting for the Shamans to kill off my dad so you can claim this city for yourself. Come on, hit me. Follow me. There are 100 thousand Shaman soldiers out there. They encircled Beipo like filling iron into a bucket. How can our cavalry escape? I heard the messenger got shot and he still escaped. This arrow belongs solely to the King of Shaman. The King is the best shooter in the North, he never misses. So I am sure he missed the messenger on purpose and didn’t kill him. His final aim is to kill off the relief around Beipo. Kill off the relief. Li Zhuifeng is like this eye of the lamb. Can we feed on him if all of us Shaman are here? What I want, is the Devine Land, the whole lamb. If we send off our troops from Gandang, they will be killed off on their way. Gandang is the final shield for the Divine Land. If we lose Gandang, Shaman will go all the way east until they reach the East City. Then, my father… Commander Li is the God of Warfare in Divine Land. The news of losing him will shock the nation and boost the morale of Shaman. Therefore, I will find a way to safe Commander Li. After all, he is my future father-in-law. I won’t let him rot out there. I will prepare some noodles for you. Zizai. Zizai. [Divorce letter] Huang Zizai. You traitor! I’m not going to forgive you! Bull Rock. Help! Help! Someone, please help! Help! What’s wrong with her? She is stung by a scorpion. Where? Her chest. Maybe it’s a male scorpion. Are you gonna save her or not? Oh Brother! Why are you in such a rush? Last time you said I was too late. This time you say I am too early. How come it’s so troublesome to simply be a robber? This guy looks way better than the previous one. Stop battering your eyelashes. This guy is quite good. Come on! Junior, stop being a Narcissus! Come and help! Ahhhh! Sis! It’s the quicksand. Taking of your pants? Now? Cut the crap and come help! Hold on tight! Quit your vulgar business. Up you get, gal. Husband. What? Husband. Yah! Can you be more professional from now on? Rob only, no flirting. Stop bugging. Junior? Junior? Junior? Can you both be more professional? Report. According to our spy, Gandang remains still. What? The King of Shaman orders you to withdraw all the troops. Pass on the words. The main troops go back. The inspectors and I will stay. Yes. They are not going to save the great God of Warfare? Why this again? Come on, eat. This is the last meal. Commander. What’s in the pot? Ah. Pretty nice! Meat and vegetable stew. Come sit and dig in. [God] Commander, are we going to fight the Shaman or not? Do you want to fight them or not? Of course we do. Do it quick and fast. Dying on the battlefield is way better than starving to death out here. Yes, yes. We are nearly there. Just within these days. [Bull Rock] Come on come on. Quick, go! Come on and go! Did I give you permission to flirt? What about you? Stop pointing fingers at me. I’m gonna cut your balls off today. Pretty good, huh? General, General. You should be worried about yourself. What else can you see? General, you are here in search of some people because you would like to save someone. But you are walking into a big trouble! Big trouble? What kind of trouble would it be? Am I not right? Yanqu, please listen to me. You can explain to the King of Hell. The mister and mistress are fighting again. Shoo! Yanqu! Please let me explain. I’m not going to listen to you. We are done. It’s not what you think. I have my reasons. Nonsense! The two are not local here. Stop! Isn’t there are new gal? Ah! Who are you? I’m his wife. What? What? You saved me, I marry you. Isn’t that right? You! Huang Zizai! You bastard! Stop! Who is bullying my sister? Brother, stop it! What now? Ahhhhh, don’t ask! Can you not see by yourself? If I can see, why would I need to ask you? Ok. Stop! Let me see who is messing around in Bull Rock. Come on come on. Let’s go! Ah! Old Shepherd, come on! Where’s Junior? Here. Come on. Take them. No. Go! Come, beat them up! Wait! How can you beat one up before an interrogation? Yes. Don’t you have law here? A set of law? Here in Bull Rock, Wu Liutian is the law. Come, beat them up. I would like to see you try. [God of Warfare] Wait. A token from the God of Warfare. How come you have it? I am the general to Commander Li. I rule the northwestern land on the order of the Commander. I am Li Yanqu, the daughter of Commander Li On the order of the commander, I rule General Huang. I, Wu Liutian, am the leader of Bull Rock. I didn’t know General Huang will be visiting. My apologies. It’s OK, you didn’t know it. Please stand up. So, I am wondering, what brings General Huang here? Oh, here. Do you happen to have a place to eat around here? I’m starving. General Huang, please. Actually, I… Here comes your meal! Lady, this fish is super fresh. You can tell by looking here. Mister, you must have traveled for a long while. There are so much sand and dirt on your clothes. Please take it off and we’ll clean it for you. Get out! Come on. Please go on, General Huang. Ah, Yinhe. You are planning to dine and dash again? Last night, the stars told me that there will be someone to pay for my meal today. Oh really. How many people do you have? 96 people including me. You are free to command us. Not enough. I have a solution. General, I believe you will like it. Eavesdropping? How dare you! I am a psychic. Do I really need to eavesdrop? I can foretell the future! You. Stop it. Since you already know, what plan do you have? Come, eat and talk. Eat and talk. Here, General Huang. Ladies and gentlemen from Bull Rock. I am an ambassador from the capital. I am here today to share a piece of good news with you. Commander Li Zhuifeng, the God of Warfare, has defeated the Shaman in Beipo and capture the King Mo Hayan. As an encouragement, the emperor sent me here to purchase some necessities for the troop. From cows, lamb, to clothes and food. We are to pay you 30% more than the market price. Those who are to follow me to Beipo, I will give you 50% more. Ok. Those who agree please sign up over there. I have nothing on me. Can I provide two camels? Yes. What’s your name? I would like to sign up. But can you pay me upfront? Why would I let you sign up? Because I am strong! Over there. I can give you the Money, but you are too young. You can’t go. If I can’t go, I can’t take your money. If I don’t have the money, I can’t afford to find a doctor for my mom. If my mom dies, do you want to be held responsible? Uh… Ok, I will count you in. What’s your name? Tiger. Let’s go with them. Why? There’re so many people. Someone has to cook. Yeah, make sense. Once everyone is gone, nobody will come eat at our diner. Ok. Are you in love with - that cunt - that gigolo? Now we have 328 people who signed up. That’s less than 500 people. You might not know. A remote and poor place Bull Rock is, this is where the capital imprisons wrongdoers. So, there aren’t many residents here. Since there are wrongdoers, I’m wondering whether General Huang would like to lead some people. What people? Digging every day? How stupid! You are going to work till you die. Ah. Have you seen this before? Later on, I will put it there. And I light up the fuse, the rock will drop on its own in a Bang! I won’t need your money. Just give me a round of applause then. Jump Monkey, I mean, stop bragging. We’ll know whether it’s a horse or a mule when we unveil it. Yes. Unveil it then. Lay low! That doesn’t make sense. OK. Get up, everyone. General Huang, the ambassador from the capital has something to announce. Let’s keep it short. We are seeing a great victory in Beipo. The emperor is to announce a special pardon. Those who travel with me to Beipo will regain freedom. Ok. Follow me. Let’s go. Mr. Wu, something’s up. There’s a quarrel in the prison. What? Why are you such a disappointment? Ah? Ok. Shut up. Who are they? Notorious desert robbers in the northwestern area. The woman, is called Hu Liuniang. Also known as Double-tailed black cat. Cruel and ruthless. She’s a major prisoner. I caught her just a few days ago. You? If it wasn’t the tens of thousands of Shamans who attacked my place, how would I be caught by you? It looks like you disagree with me. Come on, open her fetters. That’s not necessary. If I let you go, would you listen to my order? If you let me kill the Shamans, I am yours. Let go of her. General Huang, she is a major prisoner! You can’t just let her go! I say, let her go. Yes. Now we have 794 people. 795 including me. We are nearly ready. Oh, sir. If you knew it’s going to be dangerous, why are you still following us? Ah, General Huang, Do you know what’s the pursuit of a psychic? Betray the God and change our own fate. No means no. If this bunch of prisoners can go, why can’t I? You two can come along. But her, she definitely has to stay. Where the needle goes, the thread follows. I’ll follow wherever my husband goes. This is perfectly legit. When have I become your husband? He kissed the chest of my sister. What? What? Yes. Yanqu. Huang Zizai! You bastard! Yanqu. General Huang. Let me deal with such trivial matters. Husband. Just leave it. General Huang. And us, too. You, get on the chariot. I mean Jump Monkey, Why do you even bother to join? Don’t you see that? A chariot-load of explosives. We are there to greet and encourage them, not to get involved in war. If you shoot people, it’s a bomb. If you shoot into the sky, it’s fireworks. Are the two the same thing? Boss, for me, I’d call it the value of being peaceful. Ok, so they are the same. Right? General Huang? Ah, I mean, Old Shepherd. You are blind as an eel. Why do you bother to go? Didn’t you say that these goats are you children and you can’t slaughter them? My goats can give us milk. Can you? Ey? This old bloke can really talk nonsense. I was being unreasonable just now. I will listen to you from now on. Mister, you are really good! How did you do that? I told her you don’t have much time left and asked her to treasure the time you can spend together. You! General. The perfect timing is here. Let’s get going. Let’s go! Beipo Advance Contingent, 800 man assembled. Charge! 800 warriors marching north. 800 warriors marching forward. [Bull Rock] 800 warriors with no fear. 800 warriors here to win. 800 fierce warriors are now marching North. 800 fierce warriors boldly marching forward. 800 warriors with no fear, no fear at all. 800 warriors are here to win and slaughter them all. Gandang is still staying put. Li Zhuifeng, you have underestimated me, the King of Shaman. Arrows! Arrows! Shield! Shield! Hurry! Hide, you guys! Hurry! Careful, General! We Shaman have 100 thousand warriors. If every single one of us shoot at you, we can burry your city in arrows! Retreat! Retreat! Your Majesty, why don’t you fight your way into the city? Li Zhuifeng will battle to death if we enter now. He will sacrifice himself for sure. If we can encircle him until he surrenders, that would be a huge blow to the people in Divine Land. The most advanced art of war, is to conquer one’s heart. Remember, from now on, 100 thousand arrows a day. So our top mission now is to keep this secret to ourselves. Ah! How can we lie to 800 people, General Huang? Who let you inside? Why are you so jumpy? I am here to invite you to our bonfire party. Bonfire party? It smells so good! When it’s ready, everyone’ll have their own share. Come on, Tiger. Thank you. General Huang, please try my roast lamb. Who allows you to start a fire? From now on, no fire in the evening. No sound, either. Put it off. Put it all off. What’s wrong with General Huang? Rest right here. Come, take this off for me. General Huang, on the side of the dune are some Shaman patrols Let’s go see. Ok. Why are there Shaman soldiers? They are not soldiers, but the defeated. Right, they abandoned their armor and shield. Let me lead my people and kill them. Wait. You promised me you’ll listen to my order. This is not that easy. We have to think it over. Who is that? Who? Oy! Don’t rob me of my goats. Goats, ah! Oh god! Are you as blind as I am? I’m selling them to the troop from Divine Land. My goat. Old man, what did you just say? Mister, I am a blind old guy. They already reserved my goats and paid me already. If you take my goats away, you as well kill me. Who bought your goat? The reinforcements from the Divine Land. I heard they are heading to Beipo. Take us to them. Sir, if you don’t mind me asking, who are you? Don’t worry, old guy. We are a group of merchants. We also have some commodities that we want to sell to the reinforcements. But we can’t find them now. Look! Oh, ok, ok. I will take you there. Follow me. We are almost there, almost there. That old guy won’t sell us out, will he? No, he won’t. He’s heading that direction. Oh no, Shapotou! Here we are. The troop is right behind the dune. Lead the way. Where’s the troop? The troop is everywhere. Can you not see them? You! Old Shepherd! Don’t come over! Don’t come. Old Shepherd! Old Shepherd! Old Shepherd! Old Shepherd! Once, I brought a small troop to conduct a night raid. In the darkness, we quietly sneaked in the tent where their chief was sleeping. Softly, I opened the tent and approached the bed of that bastard. I slowly raised my sword and removed its sheath. Crack! You know what happened? I pulled too hard and broke the handle. So whatever they say I’m the God of Warfare. Bullshit! Ok. The Shamans had had enough fun. Let’s get back what we were doing. Commander, we already broke our own bow, why do we still need the arrows? We will return the arrows to them one day. Why didn’t our troop enter the city? You take a better look. They are all the Shaman flags! Ah? Didn’t they say we defeated Shaman? Yeah! General Huang, what’s going on here? Yeah. Did we defeat them? Or were we defeated? It’s still unclear. But our God of Warfare of the Devine Land is now trapped by 100 thousand Shamans. What? 100 thousand? Oh no, oh no. We are not here to give them food, but to give them our lives. General Huang, you! Are you not faking the emperor’s order? Right! I would rather die mining, than die in the hands of Shamans. Yes. Let’s go. Yes, let’s go. Go. I would like to see anyone try. If you move, I’ll kill you. Yes. Put your swords down. I am sorry, people. I, Huang Zizai did lie to you. Now, the one that’s trapped is the God of Warfare of the Divine Land. If we didn’t handle it well, The Divine Land will be in ruins as well. So we have to find a chance to save him. Why didn’t you ask the troop in Gandang for help? Why did you find us? Because Gandang holds tens of thousands of residents. If something goes wrong, they will be slaughtered by Shaman. We are all people, why should we die in vain? Right. I’m sorry. You may leave now. No, you are not going to die. There is a cemetery near Beipo. In that cemetery lies a tunnel and leads all the way to the crappy temple in Beipo. If we find the cemetery and the tunnel, we will be able to enter the city and save the God of Warfare. I mean, Old Shepherd, you blind man can speak even emptier and blinder words than us normal people. Shut it. At that time, when you weren’t even born yet. It was around 20 years ago. The old Shaman king died of sickness. His son Mo Hayan was the successor to the throne. He is the current King of Shaman. In order to build a tomb for his father, [Beipo City] [he captured all the young man in Beipo.] [I was among one of them.] [There was abundant treasure in the tomb.] [The King was afraid that we spoil the beans.] [So he took our eyeballs.] [They even muted some by feeding them poison.] [Later I heard that the King] [wanted all of us to die along with his father.] [A couple of brothers and I decided to] [secretly build a tunnel.] [I was the only one who escaped alive.] [Beipo has become a ghost town from then on.] Old Shepherd, can you still find the cemetery? Yes. But I’m not so sure about the entrance. Well, let me handle it. Here we are. Sir, are you sure? Shaman is alien. But the cemetery has the style from the Divine Land. If the compass is right, this should be it. General Huang, Watch this. It’s time for the Jump Monkey to do his part. We can go in as soon as you hear a bang. Wait. With that bang, Shaman will also arrive. What would you do? Dig! Right! We are the drillers. this is what we do! Brothers, grab your tools and dig! We are family with different surnames. I use broadsword. My sister uses double broadswords. And my brother, is the best archer on the Divine Land. Well, he’s good at sleeping, too. After we became sworn brothers and sisters, we also swore to become the best mountain bandits on the Divine Land. Mountain bandits? What are you doing in the desert? No. We got lost. General Huang, it’s done. Let’s go. It smells so familiar… Hey! Do you want to die? What if there are ghosts? Husband, I’ll see you inside. Wait. I’ll go in first. I am the leader. I’m not going. General Huang, they don’t want to go. They’re still hesitating. With good enough rewards, they will. I know you’re afraid. But I am a man of my word. I will keep my words. You heard it. The old shepherd said there are a lot of treasures in there. I promised you. You can take whatever you want after you save Commander Li. We’re here already. Might as well. Yeah! The Divine Land has moved. We are not even aware. Come! Attack! Yes! Your Majesty. This little Beipo City is already a spent bullet. Could you kindly give the reward to me? Fine. Then I shall wait here for your good news. Left Lord. Let’s go! Don’t touch it. Hey, they’re not going to be alive again? Who are they? That’s mine! Don’t take that from me. Sir, what’s wrong? The air is strange here. Stop it now! You can only take it after saving Commander Li. Whoever disobeys will be punished. Shepherd. Yes. Lead the way. OK. You all are blind here. But I am not. General Huang, it’s here. Let’s go! Attack! Get them out of here. Hurry! Attack! Attack! General Wu, watch the gate. Yes! Yinhe, let’s wait it out. Commander Attack! Liuniang! Liuniang! Hatred doesn’t solve any problem! That’s because you don’t hate enough! Commander! Father! Father! Father! Father! Commander! Commander! Father! Commander! Father! General Huang, we fixed the gate. Alright. He’s waking up. He’s awake! Please forgive me for getting here so late! Has the help arrived? These are? I gathered 800 warriors to save you. Me? What did I tell you before I left? But you are the God of Warfare of the Divine Land. If anything happens to you… Shut up! I apologize. Wars made me the God of Warfare. I just want to be free from it. This way there would be peaceful Everywhere. Father! Commander! Father! Commander! What’s the matter? He just lost a lot of blood and passed out. You have finished your task. Guard Commander Li and take him back. What? Are you not coming with us? If we all leave, Shaman will attack Gandang. The people there will suffer. How can you save this bloody place all on your own? Beipo is broken. But it’s part of the Divine Land. And I’ll fight for it. Don’t be stupid. There are 100 thousand Shamans coming. You won’t make it. Sometimes, you have to wait for the opportunity. I believe our help will be here soon. I don’t care. I want you to come with me. Yanqu. You can go. I can’t. I am a warrior. I don’t get to choose. Well said, General Huang. I will follow you wherever you go. Killing enemies here is much better than mining. I’m not leaving either. I will follow my husband wherever he goes. Ay. My silly sister. This is not a game. You can go. You haven’t even found your partner. What are you saying? We said it when we swore: we live and die together. I’d like to go. But junior is sleeping again. I will definitely get lost leaving alone. Don’t look at me. I’m here to kill those Shamans. Not here to save this God of Warfare. Wife, Should we go? Let’s wait and see. Are you going? This is home. Where do I go? I won’t go either. Yanqu, only you can protect the wounded and Commander Li. I’m not going. Wife, I promise you, I will marry you as soon as we finish this. We must get our father home. Come back alive. I don’t want to be a widow. Please take care of our husband. Remember, I am the first! Yes, sister! Let’s go. Well done everyone. Go rest well. Eat well. Tiger, let’s go. Sister, I can’t leave. I already took the money. My mum said, I should be a man of my word. I will be back to help you. Promise. Yes! Promise. Beipo is small, but there are four gates. We need to keep three of them. Leave this one. But Beipo is so broken. There isn’t anything to secure the gates. You’re right… I wish Jump Monkey was here. Bang. All sorted. Tell me. Which gate do you want? Is that Jump Monkey? Yes, old shepherd! Yes! Hey, Liuniang. Yinhe. The birds leave only its sound behind. People leave their legacy behind. First group. Ready. Shoot. Second group. Ready. Shoot. Can you keep it down? I heard your brother said that you are the best archer in the Divine Land. He’s talking nonsense. I am the best archer in this world! You! General. What are you thinking? The Shamans couldn’t get in last night. I am sure that they will be coming back tonight. General, what do we do? We can only go with it. We fight. But how do we fight? 800 against 100 thousand. How is that easy? General Huang, can you give me the honor tonight to fight? Your Majesty, give me another chance. Left Lord, winning and losing. It happens. Don’t take it too hard. Stand by me and help me out. God and saints. All spirits. Here I am today. Asking for your help. Wind blows. Come, ghost warriors. Show yourself. What’s he saying? Asking for help from ghost warriors. Ghost warriors? Look, Your Majesty! Protect his Majesty! Hurry. Retreat! Protect his Majesty! General Huang is back. Husband. Call me General from now on. General Huang. You must be tired, general. Good sir. What have brought you here? Don’t worry. I have my reason. Come, General Huang. Here. Yinhe is indeed very good. Food is ready! We have nice buns tonight. Come. Come eat. Here you go. Wife, get me one. I’ll get General Huang some food. Go ahead. Are you trying to hit on someone again? What are you even saying? Get going. Hey brother, have some. Can I call you mother? What? Mum! I’m so afraid. I just want to go home. Kid. There, there. Almost there. Old shepherd. Yes. Liuniang. You keep horses? Sure. But we don’t have enough grass for them. They’re starving. Why are you chopping these? Shut up. Come. Do you see this line? One chop. Cut it open. I knew you couldn’t. I’ll go get your wife. Wait. Whoa. Not too bad! Look at this. Make 10 more of this! I’m a cook. Not a carpenter. What are you doing anyway? Just do it. I’ll find you a pretty wife after this. Haha, yes! Jump Monkey! The counsellor is looking for you. Counsellor? Yinhe. Come. When did he become a counsellor? Keep working. Might make me a general! Your Majesty. We found this last night. Your Majesty. This is a sword from the Old King. Get the horse ready. Yes! Can you do it? Sure. But General Huang, After this, can you make me a general after this? Sure. No problem. Your Majesty. I think this might be a trap. I’ll go in first. Let’s go! Split up and find the hidden path! Yes! Stop. This is fate… Well done. General Monkey. Damn it. We’ll never get out again. Sir, what do we do next? Only the strong ones win in wars. Not the smart ones. Shaman lost to us twice because they underestimated us. But from now on, the real war is beginning. General Huang. This is the defense plan I designed. Have them get down to it. You do your best. Leave the rest to God. Didn’t you say we can change our fate? Yinhe. Who are you? How do you know so much about Shaman King? I am… Hurry up! It’s wrong. Wrong? Who’s wrong? The instruction. It’s upside down. General Huang. Here is your stuff. General Huang. What are you doing? Such a waste. I know. Yinhe asked me to do it. We shall follow. Come on. Try harder! General Huang. Oh no, general. General Huang. What’s wrong shepherd? Hu Liuniang has left the city with her people on horses. What? Let’s go. Let’s see. What’s going on here? General Huang. During the night, Liuniang just took our horses with her people. Who was guarding? Me. Why didn’t you stop them? I fell asleep. You! Brother. Did she run away? Shut up. She must have gone to rob them. Liuniang came from the mid land. She was sold to the northwest. She went through a lot. Then, she married a merchant. And had a baby. Her life was not too bad then. But who knew, during one trip, they met some Shaman soldiers. The whole family was killed by Shaman. She was humiliated but survived. After that, she gathered a group of people who were also hurt by Shamans. They occupied the mountain. Swore to kill all the Shamans. Liuniang. Shoot! Let’s go! Attack! General Huang, let’s kill. No one leave here without my order. Isn’t that the shepherd? Old shepherd. What are you doing? Are you out of your mind? To let the sheep eat! They’re hungry. They want to eat the Shamans. Get him back! Save it guys. General Huang. Thank you for taking me home. Right, General Monkey. I borrowed something from you. I will give them back to you in my next life. Come back! 800 warriors marching north. 800 warriors marching forward. 800 warriors with no fear. 800 warriors here to win. Hold it. I’m here to see the Shaman King. I have a gift for him. What have you brought me then? What is it? What is this? The sleepy one! Tell them what this is! You stupid. Stupid bastard. Give me my gunpowder back! My gunpowder! Ah! Attack Beipo! Yinhe. What should we do next? We lost so much. General Wu. Give this letter to Shaman King. You are my brother by blood. Why are you helping the Divine Land against your own people? Shaman. The Divine Land. Who cares? At lease I’m a decent person. 20 years ago, I saw you killing my father. I couldn’t have my revenge. You think you can now? What’s going on? Yinhe is the King Zuorizhu from Shaman. What? He’s the Shaman King’s brother. Ah! Oh! Let my father know about my victory. [Beipo City] Get ready. On your mark! Attack! Attack! You haven’t eaten? Food. Food is here. Food is ready. Out of my way. What are you saying? You don’t want it. We want it. What on earth are you doing? Get your weapons and go! Ok! Bring that down to me. Throw! You can’t throw this away. Throw! Where are you going? To see General Huang. Ah! Keep throwing. Fry it! Stir it! Stew it! Boil it! Blanch it! Steam it! Braise it! Bake it! Slice it, chop it, stew it, blend it, mix it. Season it, freeze it, drizzle it, peel it, roast it! Serve! Why aren’t you guarding it? My brother is there. Hold it here. I’ll go to the gate. Ok husband. Whatever. Go! Fall back! Go to the alley! Jump Monkey. Go! Ok. I’ll fire another one! Why aren’t you doing anything? Want me alive? I am General Monkey. No way I’ll be captured. Attack! Brother, let’s go! Ok! Run! Mum! Run! Get your mum! Run! Husband! Nenya! Nenya! General Huang, you go first. Wife. Husband. I’m lost again. What’s your name? What’s your name? Nenya! Nenya! Hang in there. Nenya! Nenya! Husband! I won’t make it. Can I hear you call me your wife before I go? Wife. Nenya! I have strength! Attack! Attack! Who are you? I am who you’re looking for. God of Warfare. Let me ask again. Who are you? God of Warfare. I’ll ask again. Who are you? God of Warfare. Quick! Your Majesty, something is wrong! Help from the Divine Land is arriving. What? Those outside of the gate? All gone. Shaman King. Go to hell! We won. The Divine Land kingdom is vast and grand. From desert to ocean. From the east to the west. From the north to the south. We only have some Shamans on the west border of the Divine Land. We’ll just fight them. Fighting isn’t hard. Finding them is. They are like sheep. Scattering across the north west Gobi Desert. We spent much time looking for them but had no luck. Because it’s very hard to take them all down. Follow me. I have an idea. Use me as a bait. Get them come into the Beipo city. You can work with other major forces from the Divine Land. And kill them all for the Divine Land. Commander. This is too dangerous. Let me do it. A big fish needs a big bait. I am the God of Warfare after all. One day, I will be the God of Warfare [God of Warfare] [God] [1 year later] [God of Warfare Temple]
