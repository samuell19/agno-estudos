September Diary September 1st feeding the carp diary, chronology of the passing days you too, have known this, happy days, followed by days of doubt I show you all these moments take good care of them there is cause, or of the little space left for chance Shall I play? portrait of Anahit going through 30 years of correspondence I come across the self-portraits Walter sent over the years I take the train to meet with him after all this time, and do his portrait found the egg of a Cyclops I remember I have always loved, more than anything, the sound of bagpipes. In a previous life, not long ago, I remember it well, I was in Her Majesty's Royal Scots Guards regiment and we experienced the shortest battle of all time. It was in South Africa. We were going to fight Zulus, thousands of Zulus. With our bagpipes and our uniforms, ahead of the other regiments, we were first to arrive at the top of the hill. When the Zulu tribesmen saw us, they thought women in skirts playing music, had been sent to fight them. In disgust, they threw their spears and shields to the ground and left. portrait of Gilles What is this foreign land that lies between two nights? It is the day. meeting with Eug√©nie, now a vocalist this morning, at my door as I was filming, the barrel organ player passed behind me it was the last time I saw him ah, little spiders in your nursery, you too feel how exciting life is I've something better to play for you. Olivier and his favorite music from the Solomon Islands We always come back to this. They're so beautiful! antarctic poetry (in memory of Stany) when the fog would lift on the pack ice, we would sometimes see a man in the distance, made tiny by the horizon yet all the men in the crew, all of them, were sure they could see him cry back on land, some of them said that the sunbeams were reflected in his tears night of September 12th to 13th things brought back from the night It's a waiting room, early in the morning, where haggard people, suitcases at their feet, await the bus to another country. It's an ocean liner that unendingly leaves the port, prolonging the suffering of a farewell. It's a heavy truck without a driver on a highway parking lot. It's a hotel room where he sheds tears of joy. It's the shadow of his hand on the words he writes when he writes at night. It's the first morning bus to cross the intersection. It's the image of a tower from the top of which it would be easy to throw oneself. It's the photo of an animal who stops to pose in front of the slaughterhouse. It's a man ashamed of cheating who cheats anyway. twenty years later, I make another portrait of Mohamed, at the pool where he works When you meet with Mohamed's smile, your day is not wasted for a long time now, every time I visit Jacqueline, I give her a tiny object I come across them again, all kept together "We all wake up in the same place of the dream. Everything begins in this world and finishes elsewhere." Victor Hugo. There should be a place where one could get relief from death. "Choosing a quote is like auditioning an actor." M.A. Ouaknin Is everybody ready? Let's do it. "There is no other remedy for life and death than to enjoy that which separates them." Good, thank you. Next! "To live without love is to die every day." Lovely. Who said that? - Mrs du Deffand. "Maria had a child, a baby daughter. People found her adorable, they wearied her with kisses..." No, no, no... - But it's Flaubert! Yeah, OK, but... We'll see later. "Sound films invented silence." Thank you. "The best things in museums, are the windows." Very good. Who said that? - Pierre Bonnard, the painter. "One must learn to doubt before one learns to believe." "For a long time, I went to bed early..." - No, not that! I have another one. - OK... "I am all the others. Any man is all men." Borges. - Jean Genet said the same thing. going to Morocco to film Jean Genet's grave, facing the sea, simple and bare as the grave of a Greek hero a walk on the edge of a world in perdition going to Basel to see Holbein's Dead Christ, like Dostoevsky did, with his wife Anna Dostoevsky said: "You mustn't ask too much of human nature, one must be merciful." There is Christ. His miracles made him famous, and everything went fine up until then. But there is this moment of doubt, terrible doubt. His followers leave one after another. Even the apostles doubt. Even he doubts. He asks them why they are still there, why they too don't leave. And Simon answers: "To whom would we go?" In the room, they both approach the Dead Christ and Dostoevsky, overwhelmed by emotion, whispers to Anna: "This picture could make one lose his faith." avoid fashions, work with your own sensitivity how to do that in filmmaking? as doubt and fragility get stronger and stronger as the more films I make, the more I build on doubt Fishermen singing. portrait of Jeanne, sound engineer Street in Lisbon, afternoon. These are frogs in a little pond close to Voltera. Gathering of herds at the end of the day, on the shores of Lake Ala Kul. School atmosphere with accordionist playing in the middle of the playground. Flies at the entrance of a yurt. Night atmosphere in Mekele, at two in the morning. Singing of Kyrghyz shepherdess, Kyrghyzstan. Blackbird singing at Eric's place, on a Friday evening. good news for the film: Olivier can go to the Solomon Islands to bring us back images of the musicians he adores a few reels of film, the old 8mm camera and he's off! rain all day "Maria had a child, a baby daughter. People found her adorable, they hugged her and wearied her with caresses and kisses. Maria was breastfeeding the child herself. One day, I saw her uncover her breast and present it to her baby. It was full and round, with dark skin and azure veins showing beneath the ardent flesh. Until then, I had never seen a naked woman. What singular ecstasy the view of that breast plunged me into! I devoured it with my eyes. How I wished to simply touch it! If I placed my lips upon it, my teeth would have bitten into it with frenzy. And my heart melted away in delight, as I thought of the thrill such a kiss would bring." we have all been children and remember the breast, first object of desire Veronica Franco was one of the great Venetian courtesans. Tintoretto painted her several times. But this painting is unique for its tension: the tension between the gesture of baring herself and avoiding eye contact, the tension between giving and rejecting. Tell me when you're filming. - It's rolling. death of Paul Anrieu remembering an experiment, filmed long ago under the influence of alcohol Hamlet take two. "To be or not to be? That is the question." Yes, go ahead, drink. It's just to keep track of the amount and the time. Before each of the following takes, Paul Anrieu will drink two large glasses of alcohol until exhaustion. It's good stuff. But you can't drink it so fast. You can set your own rhythm. Hamlet take three. "Who would fardels bear, to grunt and sweat under a weary life, but that the fear of something after death..." Hamlet take four. "Conscience does make cowards of us all." Hamlet take five. "The fear of something after death, that undiscovered country, from where no traveler returns puzzles the will..." The text seems to be coming pretty automatically. More or less. More or less. Hamlet take six. It's rolling... or spinning, I'd say. Because now... Let's try to remember what this is about. "To die, to sleep. To sleep? Perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub." Hamlet take seven. "Thus conscience... does make cowards of us all." Hamlet take eight. "And thus conscience does make cowards of us. Cowards of us all!" farewell Paul, you who were brave enough to try this experiment drunkenness overcame you, but Hamlet held you up self-awareness is the most fragile thing Zola and the love of animals One must remember the anecdote in which Zola, taking notes and doing research for Germinal, went down a coal mine for the first time. There, coming across a horse in the tunnels he asked how such a beast had been brought down in such a small lift. The miners, laughing at this bourgeois question, replied that the beast had been there for years, deep in the mine, pulling wagons, that it had been brought down young, when still a foal. Zola was known for his love of animals, which always shone through in his works. I wanted to find what Zola wrote of them in his novel. Indeed, his writer's compassion is equal to the shock he felt during his research. The lines are magnificent. He speaks of the horses "as if tortured by regret for the light." There is an old horse and a younger one. Zola writes: "They lived with lowered heads, breathing in each other's nostrils, exchanging a constant dream of daylight, visions of green grass, of white roads, of infinite yellow light. The old one could no longer remember, the young one could not forget." no news from Olivier no news from the other side of the world revisiting the secrets in the treasure box my grandfather gave me long ago... breast tree ...until I found the film fetish, which is doing its best to bring Olivier back Passport Application Form fictional representation of the Solomon Islands each instant unique, fragile as a dream night of September 30th to September 31st what if, for a few days, like a secret miracle, September wasn't over for the duration of a novel? Right, it's time to start this novel. It's set in Indonesia in the eighties. He was returning from Celebes, east of Borneo, and taking a plane to Bali. He thought he was the only white person on the little propeller plane, which could carry ten people, when an American, rather chubby and totally drunk, collapsed near him in a vacant seat. Since the American was mumbling away, incoherent - only the name of the Javanese town of Surabaya was clear - he got the impression the man was going to Surabaya, and had boarded the wrong plane, since this one was going to Bali. He tried to explain to the man his mistake so he could get off before takeoff. But the man was too drunk and just kept repeating he was going to Surabaya. The plane took off, but after half an hour of bumpy flight, the captain announced they were heading into a giant tropical storm and must land in Java for the night. It was the rainy season and they landed on a flooded airfield. When the plane finally stopped, he could see the hut that served as airport through the rain. A neon lit up the name of the city where they had landed: Surabaya. Feeling the immobility of the craft, the American awoke, still drunk, and tried to get up and step off the plane. The man tried to tell him that, as amazing as it might seem, they were in Surabaya after all. Without a glance, and pushing ahead of him, the American answered, staggering: "Of course we're in Surabaya." So, that's the beginning: the story of this man who gets what he wants without noticing a thing, almost despite himself, and who sets the tone for the whole novel. time passes... at last... a package arrives from the Solomon Islands! I'm staying in Paradise. Imagining the plot of a novel is a happy occupation. Going so far as to write it is an exaggeration. J.L. Borges It's the story of a man who dedicated his life to God, but he himself doubted so much, that with his faith built on doubt, he never convinced anyone. For a long time, he was a missionary in New Caledonia, among the Kanaks and he became friends with them. He was aware he'd never really converted anyone, but at least, after thirty years, he left as their friend. At his farewell party, he pointed out to the chief that he had at least taught them what a soul was. But the chief replied that they'd known about souls for a long time. Their religion taught them what a soul was. Whereas the missionary's religion had taught them the importance of the body and the flesh. He then returned to Europe and he was given a little parish, lost somewhere in the south, a village where only a few families and old people lived. He became friends with the carpenter, a married man who had two children. It was a remote village and only the postman connected them to the outside world. But one day, the postman ran off with the carpenter's wife and they were never seen again. So the carpenter, alone and in despair, killed himself along with his 8-year-old son and his 3-year-old daughter. The priest found himself with the three coffins in his little run-down church and burst out sobbing, and cried for a long time. He cried the void of heaven and the solitude of man. Those three coffins left him in a world without God, and for the first time, he was cold in his little church. He gave up everything and left. His soul destroyed, he was left with the illusion of finding salvation through the flesh. to live without love is to die every day. We must finish telling the story of the man abandoned by God. His life became a slow descent into hell, where flesh submerged everything. As he drifted, he met a sick adolescent girl on the run, who led him into debauchery for she knew she was condemned and didn't want to die a virgin. From town to town, from alcove to alcove, they corrupted each other into the unspeakable, until her death. Then, alone, he continued his descent, step by step, first here, then abroad where he fled. He is now at the end of his journey, the journey that took him back to Asia. Nighttime. The bus, on which he is the only foreigner, is driving along a little asphalt road in the jungle. Suddenly, a young elephant crosses the road and crashes into the front of the bus. The impact is dreadful. The headlamps shatter and it is night. Everyone gets out of the bus and sits in a circle around the dying elephant. Answering the elephant's weakening cries, echo calls from the jungle and trumpeting from the herd. Above them, the Milky Way. It is the last night he remembers as a human living among humans. It is thus there, in the Tropics, that he hits the bottom of drunkenness and drugs, devastated by the flesh. After a night of debauchery on psychotropic substances, no longer knowing who he is, he climbs to the top of a dune. He is in such a state that he weeps, dribbles and soils himself. He is a wreck. And suddenly, before the starry night, he feels torn open, quartered, and projected outside of himself up to the firmament of stars shining in the night. At the same time, he feels all these heavenly bodies, all these worlds, all these stars, are inside him, deep within. A terrible feeling, to be torn and flung into the vast universe. A terrible feeling to carry the whole universe within, to be the universe. It lasts for hours and when he comes round at dawn, on top of the dune, undone, haggard, soaked, he knows he won't go any further, that his journey is over, that he has found the meaning of everything, of consciousness and the movement of time. He looks back and understands that flesh, his long dive into flesh, into the terror of flesh, stopped the flow of time. Now time resumed its course. And that was a good thing. For the film led up to this moment, the whole film led up to this instant, where the flow of days comes to an end, leaving the spectator, having shared this illusion, in his regained freedom, in his own time.
