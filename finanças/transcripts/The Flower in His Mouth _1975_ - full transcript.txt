RESPECTABLE PEOPLE AKA The Flower in His Mouth Am I bothering you? Yes. I'm sure we'll get along fine. I like women like you. Good evening. - Evening. Evening. Good evening, Miss Bardi? - Yes. The new teacher? - Yes. I am Allegrezza, the usher from the school. My principal appointed me to bring you to the house he got for you. Is this yours? - Yes. Is this yours too? - Yes, why? That's fine. Come, it's close by. There's the door. Come. Thank you, you're very kind. - It's nothing, Miss. Good night. I've read your resume attentively and its peculiar notes. A little too peculiar, at least for my school. Right. I realize that but… I don't know how else to do it. I'm for traditional teaching. Here is your attendance book. By the way, thank you for the house. It's very comfortable. Don't thank me but the owner: Counselor Bellocampo. It was he who made the house available. Fine, I'll see him today. Where does he live? In his palazzo in the square. Anyone can show you. Come, I'll introduce you to your colleagues. Master Solarino. - A pleasure. - Likewise. Professor Belcore. - Welcome. Thank you. Good, everybody. Good luck to all. Come, I'll show you your classroom. - Thanks. Do you teach elementary? - Yes, the 3rd. Next year, I'll get your students. - Right. So try to do a good job. That way I'll have less work to do. OK? What are the kids like? Poor and difficult. However, the climate is great and the country beautiful. We even have the ruins of a Greek theater. Ah, is that so? This is it. - Thanks. I'd love to see a Greek theater. Abalone, Giovanni. Abalone, Santina. Abalone, Gaetano. - Present! We have at least one Abalone. Hey, Gaetano, are Giovanni and Santina your brother and sister? This city was destroyed 3 times: First by the Saracens, then by the Swabians, and finally by an earthquake. Yet the survivors always built it in the same place. No one could eradicate them. But I found out there are almost 3,000 emigrants worldwide. Yes, they work like animals. To save much to return and make a home. If they return, there must be a reason. There isn't. How did it go with your students? So-so. But I realized something: Yes means no and viceversa. Isn't that right? How did you get assigned here? Not appointed, transferred. I was transferred from Sondrio where I was transferred from Grosseto and before that Turin, etc. 8 different locations and… always for the same reason. Why? Well… let's just say I'm not the kind who's liked by my superiors. You just need to be here a year. A year is long, I think. Anyway, if you need anything, you can count on me. That's very kind. Thank you. And now let's go to the owner of the house and talk about rent. What is he like? - Counselor Bellocampo? Yes. - He used to own this town. And now he's nobody. Woe is me. The rent will be probably high then. Come on, get on. - No, I'll walk back. It's mainly downhill but thanks. Come on, I'll let you off before we get to town. Be brave. Alright. Ready? - Ready. Come in, Miss. - Thanks. One moment. I am Antonio Bellocampo. And I'm Elena Bardi, the new teacher. I know. I came to thank you. Thank me? Why? Well, naturally I came to… - This way, please. You have a magnificent home. - Yes. It seems to be isolated from the rest of the town. Indeed. Please have a seat. Thank you. This liqueur is exclusive to my family. My father… was very proud of it. But be careful: Just wet your lips and breathe it in because apparently, it's an aphrodisiac. Now then, Counselor Bellocampo, regarding the house, shall I discuss it with you or do you have an administrator? With me. - Good. How much is the rent? There is no rent. It's enough for me that you like it. Oh, no! I… Do you like it? Is it comfortable? Yes, of course. It's perfect. To be honest, it looks like it was made for a single lady. In fact, that small house was actually built in 1930. My father built it for my sister, Angelica, who at the age of 18, decided to live there as a nun in the solitude of her prayers. She was still young when she died, and the house remained empty for nearly 40 years. It pained me very much because an empty house… always reminds me of something that died. Excuse me, why didn't you rent it out earlier? I was so devoted to my sister that I couldn't find another… in this town who was worthy to live where she did. And you really think I am? But you gave it to me before I arrived, Counselor. Before you even met me. I had hopes at first but now… now I know. Good evening! May I have the honor to offer you a cognac? I've been waiting for you the whole afternoon. I like you very much. I like all of you, even what I can't see. Go away, scoundrel! Scoundrel! What kind of people are they? A shitty place! Mr Villará? Mr Villará! Who did it? - Persons unknown, Sir. Naturally. No, no, nothing. He had no weapon on him. Just a wallet in his right pocket with about 50,000 lire. It wasn't a robbery. Careful! Who is he? - Calogero Villará, Magistrate. 32 years old, profession: broker. A broker of what? All that can be bought and sold: houses, land, orange groves, cars… Criminal record? - Exploitation of illegal immigrants, extortion in the workforce, assault. Acquitted 9 times at court for lack of evidence. Politics? - He sold votes too. During the election campaign, he was with Senator Cataudella, let us just say, to help "persuade" the voters. Relatives? The old man is his father. He's in a hospital in Palermo, eaten alive by arthritis. We have 100 motives for the crime… therefore none. Right, Sergeant? Well, I don't think so. 100 motives? Sure. But there's something which rules out 99 of them. Miss Bardi? Yes. - Sorry, you must come with me. Come with you… Why? I don't know. I must escort you to the station. Now? But I have classes. Don't worry, we've already informed the principal. This way. What is it? Did something happen to my mother? No, heaven forbid. The magistrate only wants to ask you a few questions. Hello, I'm Occhipinti. Please be seated. Did you know a certain… Calogero Villará? Is he from this town? No, look, I arrived 2 days ago. I barely know anyone. But this Villará, Miss, you definitely knew him. I said I didn't. Why do you ask? A tall, young, dark man. Somewhat elegant. No. Please follow me, Miss. Take a good look. My God! He's dead. Correct. He was killed last night with a 5-shot revolver. They put a flower in his mouth and fixed him on the chair. Everybody saw it. Do you mean to tell me that you don't know it? Why should I know anything about it? I was leaving my house this morning to go to school. I didn't see anything and nobody said anything. How could I know anything? - Yes but you knew him? You admit that now? - Now I do. Why did you deny it before? Because I hadn't seen him. You said a certain Villará. How should I know what his name was? What do you want from me? How am I connected to this? You may not be connected, Miss, but there is one detail: The flower they put in his mouth. - Well? This has never happened. It's new. Usually, a stone is placed in the mouth. That means they talked too much. Or they shoot them in the back with a lupara loaded with old nails. That means a cheap man. Or they cut off… excuse the expression, eh, the thing… the penis… I don't know if it's clear… - Yes, I know what that is. Right. And they put it in his mouth. That means the dead had used it too much while he was alive. by bringing outrage upon another's honor. But the flower, Miss, is something new. Rather, to be exact, very ancient. It hasn't been used for centuries. The old timers say it means whoso offends a flower, dies by a flower. A very nice custom indeed. And what is the nicest thing in this world, Miss Bardi? The police. No, it is woman. A beautiful woman. Like you, for example. It turns out yesterday afternoon, that man Calogero Villará… insulted you… before everybody in the square. True or false? Of course, it's true. Yes! Because in this town you can insult a woman without any consequence! Where were you yesterday afternoon, Sergeant? And the carabinieri? What kind of place is this? Yes, Sir, I admit it: that man offended me. He insulted me before everybody. But I didn't know him, not even who he was! I didn't know him and nobody blinked an eye! But the fact is that the man was killed. Right, I killed him! Yes, I dragged him into the middle of the square, put him on the chair and then put a flower in his mouth! You could have… had someone do it. Anyway, don't leave town. Remain available for questioning. What a bunch of bullshit! What fucking place did I come to? Sir, excuse my being late and thanks for looking after the kids. No need for thanks, Miss Bardi. I took them to the garden when I saw that you hadn't come. I thought you wouldn't be in today. And given the circumstances, if you don't feel like it, why not stay home a few days? Does "given the circumstances" mean I shouldn't come to school? No, for heaven's sake! I said it for your sake. I feel the need, Miss Bardi, to express the solidarity of the entire teaching body. We're happy to have you with us. We are honored. Carry on! Good day! See what a fine day it is? Yes, you were right. The climate is always excellent. Maybe too much so… Hello, Miss Bardi. Please, wait a moment. I must talk to you. It's urgent. My name is Agostino Profumo, correspondent for the radio and the Palermo paper. I want to ask a few questions. Don't be afraid. It'll only take a few seconds. But who are you? Are you born a Sicilian? Or do you become one? You, what is your name? Sebastiano Calafiore. What does your father do? A drudge. What do you mean by drudge? One who does all the hard, tiring work, like carrying stones and other things. A job that no one else wants to do. Miss Bardi? - Take me home, please. What do they want from me? Nothing, don't worry. Come. This way! Let's go this way. Here we are safe and sound. - Good thing you were there. They wouldn't have done anything. They know the carabinieri are watching. They at least do that. Let's hope so. - Are you calm? Shall I leave? No, I don't want to be alone. Come in. What's the matter? Come on! Afraid the town will kick me out if I let a man inside my home? No. It's absurd. They think I killed Villará or had him killed. It's crazy. Crazy! Even the magistrate suspects me. And everyone else, the whole town. Why do they doff their hats, act so honored and bow? I don't understand. Why? Because they think you killed him. Or had him killed. That's what it is. That's what scares me. And you? What do you think? I don't think anything. What do you mean you don't think? Imbecile! Where are you going now? Did I offend you? Or maybe you're afraid? Alright. Go away. Leave me alone. You too. Would you like some coffee? - Yes thank you. I'm afraid I'm bothering you with my problems. No, I'm just a little embittered. You see this is a small town with a noble and savage history. Thanks, Nuccio, you can go. But things that happen today are no longer noble, just savage. That's why I've kept the balconies always shut for years. I can pretend that outside, something else is happening, that I would like. Do you never open them? When I feel like it, I draw the curtain and watch the spectacles men always make of themselves. However, I'll open them more often, because now finally, the prima donna is on stage. Do you think too that man was killed because of me? Come, take a look. Dr Sanguedolce. 30 years ago, he seemed destined for a brilliant career. There was even a great marriage: a Capodieci from Palermo, beautiful and wealthy. Until after 3 months, the young wife unexpectedly entered the stables in their villa in Monreale, and there found her husband… God, how can I say it? She found him naked, on all fours, gasping beneath another man, a youth of 18, a stable boy. My God… A great tragedy. Given that, therefore if he had fallen for Villarà and was… either rejected or blackmailed… Need I say more? It's just a hypothesis. Ah, there he is! Look: handsome and impressive. The Mayor, Counselor Domenico Liolà, nicknamed "Sparaganasce". What does that mean? A fish of no value, a subspecies of mullet, that swims zig-zag, continually changing direction, like our Liolà: first he was a liberal monarchist and then… all of the sudden, he was a democratic socialist. Years later, he married 500 hectares of citrus groves and moved to the ranks of the Christian Democrats. Of course! Now he serves Senator Cataudella, who as soon as he was elected named him mayor for life. And that Villarà was in a way, linked to Cataudella. In politics, you see, a collaborator can become inconvenient at any time, to the point where his mouth needs to be closed forever… maybe even with a flower. Probably to confuse any investigation. And what kind of person is Professor Belcore? In town, they call him Michele the Philosopher because he always has the sad, wistful look of one who knows the truth and suffers because nobody else knows. In reality, he's a nobody. At least, on this stage of mine, he's not a main character. He's just a supporting player. Therefore, incapable of murder? - No, I don't say that. You see, unfortunately, I don't think there's anyone in this town incapable of murder or of being murdered. It depends. And that's why I quit the stage. Pour yourself some coffee, if you like. For quite some time, my family tried with no success to change things. In fact, we only managed to destroy ourselves. But I'm convinced you can do do something. That's why I called you a prima donna: for your personality, your ideas, your faith, your enthusiasm, your sense of responsibility, and not lastly, your beauty, your charm. But what can I do? Your work as a teacher. An essential duty: to educate, to instruct… Sure, of course but excuse me, whom? Only 8 children out of 31 come to school. Ask yourself why they don't come and from where they don't. Here's something to get you started. Read these books and then see the town. Not just the main square, the main street. Go see the alleys, the outskirts and down to the hovels, down to the ghetto of Fiumara. Almost all your students live there. Yes, I will go. But not by yourself. I don't recommend it. It's been about 30 years since I left this house except… to go my countryside. But for you, I'll make an exception. I shall go with you. Nuccio will come get you with the car. A BLOOD FLOWER FOR THE TEACHER Did you see it? Now may I ask you a few questions? Wait! Excuse me, Miss Bardi, I understand but I'm a journalist. My duty is to tell facts… What do you want? Leave me alone! No, wait! Wait one moment! I know the magistrate discovered something important regarding you personally and I… I don't want to talk to you! Got it? Go away! It's for your benefit. Last night before midnight, a man left your house. I saw him! Listen, if you tell me who that man was, I'll tell you what was discovered, OK? You're a scoundrel! Get away! Let's make a pact: you tell me who it is… - Coward! Michele, stay here tonight. I feel like sleeping with you the whole night. I'd like to, Elena, but you know I can't. My mother won't sleep if she doesn't hear me return. No, that's not the reason. What is it then? How will you sneak out of this house when it's day? How, when even at night you hide with a scarf covering your face? I'm only doing it for you, Elena. So you don't compromise my reputation? Then, listen up. I don't care about my reputation! Understand? You can even tell everybody you're sleeping with me. I don't fear what people think! I authorize you to tell everybody that you go to bed with Maestra Bardi. Do it, Michele! Tell the principal, the mayor, the sergeant, anybody you like! Even Profumo who publishes in all the papers. What do you say to that? Eh? No, no… forgive me. I'm a fool. The only thing that matters is not losing you. I'm only afraid that you won't come again. Michele… Agostino, these are punches. They beat you and violently. I fell off my bike. Did you see them? Who was it? I fell off my bike. Sooner or later they'll kill you. You want to know too much. Know what, Doctor? For example, yesterday, you annoyed that teacher in the middle of the square, before everyone. I just wanted to talk to her. What's wrong with that? Certainly, what's wrong with that? Come. Shall I bring you home? No, there's no need, Doctor. Thank you. So you fell off your bike? Yes, Sir. I fell. Then you won't press charges? What would be the point? Sebastiano! Sebastiano! Get in! We'll bring you, hurry! How can I, Ma'am? - May I? A car can't get through! Then wait, I'll help you! One moment, excuse me. Are you the new teacher? Yes. This is my brother and these are my sisters. Are you Sebastiano's mother? - At your service. I'm Miss Bardi, your son's teacher. He's a very good, quick boy. I'm sure he'll pass. How many children do you have, Ma'am? 9. - 4 of them died: 2 died from paralysis and 2 from meningitis. 4? Miss, with all these kids, I can't go on. Can you get me help? What help? - The town subsidy. My husband applied 3 times but nothing, not even a reply. They only give it to those they like. Even if they have a salary. Since my husband can't read or write, they take advantage of him. He can't emigrate because he's missing 3 fingers. Thank God you're here, Miss. Please, write down my name. The Calafiore family. The whole town knows us. And they know how poor we are. Please enter and I'll show you my husband. Then you can judge if I'm telling the truth. He's been sick for 2 weeks. There's my husband. He's the drudge. I'll try to help you. I'll see if I can do anything. I hope I can. Miss, write down my name too. My name is Rosaria Papalia. I have 7 children. My husband's name is Francesco Papalia. He's a stonemason but he had to travel to Switzerland to work. My husband emigrated to Germany. - And mine to France. Let me speak for the Calafiore family first and then we'll see. Thank you very much. God bless you! Goodbye. - I'll show you out. They must give us aid too! Aid for everybody! Miss, we don't even have water in our houses! We have no lights, electricity! We never had it! And the sewers, Miss! The sewers in this town! We need the special law! - Go home! Home! Leave her in peace! Miss, there's no water or lights! - Go home! Nothing! We have nothing! I don't know what to do. I'm just a teacher! You can tell them! - You can! You can speak! You can! They never help anybody here! You heard what they shouted? "You can, you can." Even them for that reason. Always that reason. It's frightful. It's almost laughable. Laugh then. Reasons aren't important. Only intent matters. Take advantage of the respect you've been granted and try to do something for these poor people. You saw how they live? Why does it have to be me? Listen, why did they shout "special law"? What does that mean? A special law for redevelopment: the construction of aqueducts, roads, cheap housing. Every election campaign, I hear this from my balcony and Senator Cataudella has been promising this for years on the podium to get votes. He takes their votes, gets re-elected, and the promises remain promises. It's been 7 years since he introduced a law in parliament and it's there to this day. 7 years? - Yes, 7 years. That's why it's called "special." Go with no worries. Remember that the poor here respect and admire you. And the powerful are afraid of you. Believe me it's true. Try it and see. Goodbye. Home, Nuccio. Please, come in. Miss Bardi, these are my collaborators. We're at your complete disposal. Do you want coffee? A slush? Or perhaps you'd like a liqueur? No. Thank you. Some aid for the poor. Did you say Calafiore? - Yes. 5 children in a hovel. The father is sick. That must be "Slowass". - Just a nickname! Sorry but among ourselves the poor are known by nicknames. The rich too, dear Sparaganasce. However, he's in his bed. He has a serious illness. I couldn't tell if it were typhus or pleurisy. And they're dying of hunger. - My dear Miss, sometimes people can fake it. One must be prudent. Once to pick olives, I called this Calafiore to work for 3 days. The pay was fair: I was giving him 2000 lire a day. But he wanted 5000 because the unions, bless their hearts, decided upon that. But they say they need to work. It's not true they're so poor. And now they have the nerve to ask for aid. Excuse me, then what do you suggest? Shall we let him starve to death because he had the audacity to say he can't survive on 2000 lire a day? Or shall we wait until they decide to pass the special law? Oh, no, Miss, after the necessary formalities, the Calafiore family by tomorrow night will have aid. Thank you. - We thank you, Miss. Indeed, we count on your cooperation. And if there's anything else we should know, come back to us. Help! Hey, you! Stop! What's your name? Salvatore Passalacqua. - Passalacqua? Stop here, in the square, next to this motorcycle, and don't let anyone come near until I return! Why? Because the two on the motorcycle are dead. Fucking hell! Unbelievable things happen here! The other day, they killed a man and put him here in the square. With a flower in his mouth. He looked like an ad. And now there are two dead men arriving on a motorcycle! Who are they? - Strangers. I've never seen them here before. - The license is from Palermo, Sir. And how the hell did they get here, Sergeant? And when? And who put them in the square? What the fuck are the carabinieri doing in this town? I should like to say, that despite the weather, we were on patrol and continued to watch the houses of Villará's relatives. There are few of us. We need… - I know what needs to be done. We need to demolish the whole town! Brick by brick! House by house! Put the entire population on ferries, on buses, on trains! And disperse them through Italy! 100 in Trieste, 100 in Cuneo! 100 in Assholistan! As far as possible from this place! Level the houses with a bulldozer! And then put around it electric fences, mines, snakes! So that nobody can ever frigging return here again! How were they killed? Looks like a revolver of a decent caliber. And no one heard the shots? How many were there? From a quick examination: 2 and 4. But we must undress them. No, don't touch them! Sergeant, transport those two! Move them to the station. Shall we untie them? - No! Don't untie them! Just as they are! With the motorcycle! Yesterday when they beat me, you all stood by and watched. And now you bow. What kind of people are you? Cowards! Miss! Miss! I kiss your hands! Last night came the news of the aid. They even gave us medical care. And free medicine! Thank you. - Thank you for the good you've done. May the Lord reward you, bless you! You're welcome. - Thank you. Hi. A double espresso, please. How much? - It's all paid for. Why? Accept it, Miss. Thank you. Allow me to pass. Miss Bardi. The magistrate wants you at the station. The magistrate too! Good, I was just going there to press charges with the police. No! This way, Miss. They look alive, don't they? Who are they? You should know them. No, I don't. You sure you've never seen them? Think it over. I don't need to think about it. I said I don't know them. If that's what you wanted to know, I've nothing more to add. Goodbye and thanks for the show. Don't even move one step or I'll have you arrested! Come inside. Information from Palermo. What relationship is there between you and Senator Cataudella? A peaceful one. I… I only know him by name. What are your views? I mean politically. I voted for divorce. Is that a crime? Do you belong or have ever belonged… to extremist or secret groups? May I know why you ask that? What do politics have to do with this? It could matter… because these two, just like Villará, were involved with politics. All 3 were Cataudella's lackeys and you damn well know it! Listen, that's enough. You brought me here and pushed me before two corpses: "Miss Bardi! Don't they look alive? Do you sleep with the senator? Do you set bombs, Miss Bardi?" I warn you, one more question that doesn't even have a minimum of sense and I'll never talk again! Got it? Listen well, look carefully at these two men. I repeat: Have you ever seen them? I repeat my answer: Never. - Not true! That's a lie! Last night, these two men… attacked you, knocked you down and dragged you by the hair! I have plenty of witnesses! So you haven't even seen them once? Why? Why do you keep denying it? Because I'm afraid, alright! I'm afraid of you, your methods… Yes, it's true: They attacked me and knocked me down. But I don't know why they did it, damn it! I really don't! I was coming here to press charges. Tell him, Corporal! But I came here to denounce the living, not the dead! And now you want to put it on me? Yeah, you want to fob it off on me like that one with the flower! That's what you're thinking, isn’t it? What else should I think, Miss Bardi? A man was rude to you and he was murdered. A coincidence? Sure. But these 2 beat you up to avenge the first dead man and now they're dead too! Another coincidence? Oh, no! 2 coincidences, Miss Bardi, always add up to a certainty, at least, to yours truly! What does that toad want from me? I can be killed at any moment here and I wouldn't even know why. Miss Bardi, how can I help you? I was looking for a person. I thought he came in here. Is there an exit that way? There's the sacristy's vestibule and then the alley. But from here… Is there no other exit? Only the ones to the church. Thank you. ARNALDO MARIA BELLOCAMPO 1898-1944 You see what splendor, what solemnity? There's not a finer church in the entire province. Bellocampo? - Yes, he was… the poor brother of your landlord. And why isn't he still alive? It's a sad, cruel story which I prefer not to remember. But… - Were you looking for someone? I really don't know him. A little man with a crew-cut. Ah, Piturro! - Who is he? Do you know him? - A poor devil. The poorest of the poor. He ekes by, by helping the garbage men. They give him 2 or 300 lire apiece, and every night he cleans the streets for them. I pay him another 500 to clean the church. What do you want from him? To know what he wants from me. He's walking behind me… he follows me everywhere. With a mad look in his eyes. And then he ran and hid in here. Don't be afraid. I'm sure he wanted to ask you for help. But he doesn't have the courage because he's timid, uncouth. You see, his dream is to succeed in emigrating, like so many others but with the way he looks… Maybe, he hopes with your support and influence… Of course! I forgot that I have power now. Don't you have any wishes too? Don't you want to be a bishop? Don't be shy, ask me! It's enough for me that you think of the poor. There's so much misery. So much wants, so many problems that need to be fixed. Reverend, I have a problem too. A very urgent problem: I want to go as far away from here as possible. I want to leave immediately from this insane place of yours! Peace and good will, Reverend. Oh, God, I fell asleep. Sorry, I was waiting for you. I'm afraid I startled you. It doesn't take much now. But with good reasons, if you knew. Yes, that's why that I thought, at the cost of abusing my position as landlord, I thought I'd… To come and compliment your leading lady. And fill her room with flowers. A nice play, isn't it? Did you see, Counselor, the dramatic twist in the 2nd act? It was only a way to express my displeasure for what happened. An inadequate way, I know, but now I realize also inopportune. But I'm just an old-fashioned man. It didn't even occur to me that you needed to be alone. Excuse me. - Please, stay. Please forgive me, I'm just… just a bit on edge. I don't want to be alone. Look. Look what I bought. Maybe it'll be better company than mine. No, Counselor. I thank you for the flowers. I thank you for coming. You are the only person… who behaves like a gentleman here. But if it's so, like the magistrate says, like the evidence says, who killed them? And why did they kill them on my behalf? Aren't you flattered by the idea it could be an extravagant gift by a stranger who is madly in love with you? Don't joke, Counselor, please. I've lost all of my sense of humor. I must remain… at the disposal… of justice. And for anybody who may want to kill me or beat me up. From now on, you won't be bothered. You can be at least be sure of that, Elena. No one will touch a hair on your head. 3 dead means something even in Sicily. Indeed, they mean more here, than anywhere else. Excuse me. Good evening, Professor. Good evening, Miss. Good evening, Counselor. Um, please come in and have a drink. Excuse me, I was passing by and I wanted to… to talk about school. But I didn't know… Never mind, see you tomorrow. No, please, Professor Belcore. I must leave. I was just going. Indeed, you come at a good time. Distract our young lady with work. Give her back her confidence. I'll be going now. Our school needs you, Elena. The day you leave, if you still want to, you will be very missed and not just by me. I'll leave you that key, you may need it. I don't have another. Wait, I'll show you out. Why did he come here? Why did you come here? What did he want from you? - An what do you want from me? Go away, Belcore. Go, we have nothing to say. Coward! Where were you last night when those two were beating me? I waited for you all night! And today? Where were you today while they were tormenting me? Go on, answer! He's gone… You idiot! He's gone… - Elena… Forgive me. Open up. Let me in. Even killers sleep. Maybe even sleep in my arms. Be seated. Abalone, Giovanni. Present. Abalone, Santina. Present. Abalone, Gaetano. Present. Buscemi. - Present. Maybe today it'd be quicker if you told me who was absent. My sister Margherita didn't come because she has a fever. And why did you come to school? Mama sent me. And you, Buscemi? - My father. My father too. - Both of mine. And me! - Me too! And what was the reason they sent you all to school? Do you know, children? Well, I know. And it's not a good reason. You don't go to school to please the teacher. You go because you like it. School isn't an obligation, it's a right. Do you know what a right is? OK, have you ever seen this? - No. And you? Take a look. Have you seen it? - No. Good day, Miss. Do you, by chance, remember seeing this jacket on a child at school? Look it over carefully. It's very important. No, I don't think so. And why is it important? It was found under the porticos on the night of the double murder. Maybe someone was behind a column and saw what happened. Then he got scared, ran away and lost his jacket. You think it was a child? This is the size. A child on the porticos at 3 in the morning? Come on, Sergeant! Is that so strange? Anything can happen. True, anything can happen in this crazy town. Goodbye, Sergeant. 2500 years ago, from the cities on the coast, rich Greek merchants came here to this stupendous theater accompanied by their families. They all came to listen to the tragedies of Aeschylus, Aeschylus was a very famous playwright, and the speeches of Demosthenes. Do you know who Demosthenes is? He was the most famous orator in antiquity. It was exactly here he was beaten in a contest by Gorgias of Leontini, a lawyer and philosopher. Excuse me, I interrupted your lesson, Miss Bardi. On the contrary: You added something. You enriched it. But you know me? - Yes, but only by name. Or better yet, by reputation. I'm sure you've heard my name too. Of course! Naturally. Children! Children, this man… is a very important person. I know! I saw him in the square with a flag, shouting about politics. But today… he has done us the honor to come to us without a flag, to tell us some very interesting things. Alright, we were talking about Gorgias of Leontini. Please go on, Senator Cataudella. He is famous for having said, that truth does not exist. And even if it did, we could know nothing about it. And even if we could, we couldn't communicate it to others. But who was he? The inventor of the mafia? - No! Just a brilliant sophist, Miss. Words. Just words. But very fascinating. Don't you agree? - No, Senator. I don't. For me, only truth exists. Nothing else exists. Like the living conditions of this town. Like the reason why a necessary, just law has been blocked in parliament for 7 years. Like your truth, Miss. You're a foreigner in Sicily. You came here a few months ago. But it's like you've been here for a 1000 years, more even than that. People are dead because of you and therefore people must kill for you. Now you hold the entire town in your hand. Who is behind your truth, Miss Bardi? Senator, you worry too much about what is behind things. Worry about what's before you. Look around you. Facts matter. Yes, facts, Senator. 1000s who are your voters, if I just wanted it, would no longer vote for you. And somebody is dead just for being rude to me. Yes. They were all my people. Tell me what that is: a coincidence or a warning? A fact. And this then, this subject about a special law that the mayor came to me about, how should I interpret that? Let's hear it. As a condition? You are on the right track. Excuse me, Senator, I can't say anymore. No need to say more. You have your own way of being understood. My compliments. Bless you, your Excellency! You've promised you would forget about everything, at least for today. Cares, worries, magistrates, senators and the rest, let's leave them behind. Before us we just have a lovely day in a splendid country. OK. What a strange place. - True, it fascinates me too. It's a place which has a feckless, desolate beauty. Even… even the name is evocative: "The Hills of the First Sun". Because they're the first to be illuminated at dawn. Are these your lands? - I wish! No… Perhaps many centuries ago, they too were part of the fiefdom of Bellocampo, which was immense. I've no idea who they belong to now. Why don't they plant something here like wheat? Impossible, my dear. Wheat can't grow among stone. Then a pasture or something. - Even there the grass hardly grows. Why did you say you wish they were yours? What would you do with useless land? Land is never useless. It's always good for something. For what? One can stand on it and say "this is my land". This is my land. It's not much but it's mine. Almost 20 hectares of olives, woods and vineyards. All that's left me. It's beautiful though. Yes, and cared for with love. Come, I'll show you the house. House? It's more like a castle! It's so big. - It has become so. Too big for a lonely old man. In this room were born me, my sister and my brother Arnaldo Maria. He even… he even died there. A man of the highest order. For 7 year, he was the town mayor. Back then, he was called podestà during fascism. And this is my daughter Julia's room. She's married now, lives far away, for about 20 years. She almost never comes here. Was she your only daughter? Come. My son Luca. When he was a student, he became an officer during the war. 3 months later, he died at sea. So young… Barely 22 years old. Terrible. Yes. He was just beginning to start out in life when… all his thoughts, the things he hoped for, anything he could've done, the happiness he could've had with a woman, ended with him at the bottom of the sea, in a place I'll never know. The only thing that I know… is the date: January 12, 1943. Grandpa! Grandpa! Excuse me, Grandpa. Excuse me, Ma'am. Hi, Nicola. I wanted to surprise you: My grandson, Nicola, my daughter's youngest. The only boy. - Nice to meet you. The pleasure is mine. Excuse me, if I don't shake hands. Mine are dirty. What have you been up to? I was collecting wood in the forest. - You're tired. You're sweating. No, don't worry, I'm fine. He had his tonsils out last week. So they sent him to grandpa's to get better. And they say tonsils are useless, right, Nicola? Go and straighten up, lunch will be ready soon. Quick. Yes, Grandpa. Will you excuse me? You must be very proud of him. Yes, and I love him very much. Don't stop. Miss Bardi! Wait, Miss Bardi! I've something important to tell you! Miss Bardi! Miss Bardi! Drop me off here. Thank you. Miss Bardi, Senator Cataudella called. On Monday, the special law will be examined as a matter of urgency. In a few days, this town's fate will totally change. Are you happy? - Excuse me. You wish to make a statement, Miss? No. Good evening. I'm confused and I can't make it out. Michele, since I arrived, terrible things have happened. I know, I know. But there are positive things too. The children are going to school, that law at the parliament, eh? Sure, good or bad, I've managed to make something useful of this. It's useless. Why? You think the law won't be passed? Deluded is what you are. Even though the dead upset you. What you don't understand is that this town is dead! And no one can bring it back to life. Not even you. How is that possible? How could a town with thousands of children be dead? You are a teacher. How is it possible you don't even feel any compassion? If not, why am I charmed by you? Why do I love you? Elena, a man born here has three possibilities. First of all, to leave, to abandon everything: home, family, friends, everything. He digs a grave and buries all of that inside. Even pictures, memories. It's like dying twice! The second is more difficult: To stay in this miserable place and try to conquer it, and succeed in living like a master. You enroll in any political party and unite with the strong. And you grab everything you can. By any means: friendship, pandering, violence… And murder? - Murder too! And finally the third choice: stay among all the things that make up your miserable life: this town, these old houses, the prejudices, poverty and ignorance. To eat when it comes, to sleep if you can, to make love where you find it, and to grow old until the end. And you chose that? What happened? Maybe you've discovered something? - No! Look at this. It came this morning, express from the ministry. And what does it say? Why? Don't you know? You haven't got a clue? But I… what should I know? From the ministry? I've been promoted, Miss. "Promoted for special merit", that's the official reason. Promoted and transferred urgently to a much more important position. In Taranto. And what does that mean? - I'll explain. An inconvenient magistrate is not promoted for having investigated some banal crime of passion. They only do that, when it's about something much, much more than a crime of passion. Like what for example? - I don't know. I don't even want to know. Someone else will find out. I've done my duty. And I don't even care to know how you're involved with this and what role you play. The role of an idiot, from start to finish. Listen, one thing's certain: I have nothing to do with all of this. I have nothing to do with it and I know nothing! Why won't you believe me? I said I don't care anymore! I still don't believe you! Anyway, I congratulate you on your influence. And I thank you so much for my well-deserved promotion. Alright, let's say I believe you. Take my advice. Get out of here. While you still can. Go away from this place, take yourself away from this business. What do you want? What? MADAME TEACHER, COME TO THE CHURCH AFTER SIX WHEN NOBODY'S THERE. DON'T TELL ANYONE, COME ALONE. Maybe they'll kill me too. And lay me in the empty tomb of the podestà, like a saint. Saint Asshole! What are you doing here? What do you want? I've been looking for you everywhere. How did you know I was here? Who told you? I saw you come in. What's the matter? Are you afraid of me now too? Why should I be afraid of you? What can you do to me? What are you looking for? What am I looking for? Go on! Let's see if you can guess. I'm looking for the truth, Michele. And I'm waiting for someone to come and tell me, got it? You asked me for advice and I'll give you some: Go away. Leave this town. This isn't your town. Forget everything you've seen. Even the ones who are dead? And the murders? That's what you want me to forget, right? An organization of fear. That's what you mean! I won't leave, Michele. I won't! Someone is trying… walk all over this town. I finally understand this. But now I want to understand what I have to do with this and who put me in the middle of it and why! I want to look them in the face, I want to look them in the eyes, to see who they are. And then denounce them, disgrace them! Michele, there's a fourth way to live in a town like this. And I have chosen it. Even if I get killed like those men. No one will help you. You certainly won't. I know that. Did you never snap or revolt? Christ! The poor in this town, someday will tear you to pieces. Elena, you're just a woman. I am a human being. And what the fuck are you? Professor Belcore, I've told you the truth, now it's your turn. Don't be afraid, there's the seal of confession, eh? Did you ever happen to feel truly alive? When? Answer! While we were in bed together. Of course! I surely felt you were alive then. Come here. Come inside. What are you waiting for? Maybe you're braver than I give you credit for. Come on! Come, let's get naked and make love in here. It might be the last time. - No! Why not? Are you afraid the Lord God will mow you down with a lupara? Don't worry. God is no longer here. He left a long time ago, out of disgust! - Let go! Michele, for a while now, I had hoped that you were the one who killed those men. On my behalf. It would've been an awful thing, but at least… Michele, the Philosopher! You are a nobody! The will of the people prevailed! At last, we have a law that does justice to the centuries-old hopes of this people! The sea! The sea! A true Mediterranean civilization! Great ports and trade! Today this town takes its first step… towards its future! "…to the centuries-old hopes of this people! The sea! The sea! What you have conquered is yours forever. Forever! Bravo! Encore! Hurray! Hurray!" One moment… Miss Bardi? What are you doing here? I'm waiting for the rain to stop. What about you? Making a speech? - I was kidding. I'm preparing an article. You were talking about the sea. Why is the sea important? It means that soon we'll begin constructing a long road towards the sea. It'll start from the town and cross all the "Hills of the First Sun". But how is this, Miss? You were so instrumental in getting this law passed… and you don't know? No, I… I know that the law provides for the construction of low-cost housing, aqueducts, hospitals. Yes, Ma'am, this was to be a complete project. But since the funding, the money wasn't enough, only the first part was approved. They didn't explain that. And the other things: the aqueducts, the hospital… they'll do later. That's bullshit. - You think so? You'll see soon that the lands of the First Sun, the hills, will become building lots. What are the hell are you saying? What building lots? What do you mean? Who has money for the houses? Emigrants. It's very simple. It's an infallible calculation: 3,000 emigrants saving an average of 70,000 lire a month, after 10 years they can buy a three-room apartment. 3000 apartments, 8 million each, is 24 billion, Miss. No, it's not true. You want me to prove it? I investigated it personally. "The Hills of the First Sun" are owned by a Swiss company, based in Zurich, pratically made up of one member: an 11 year old boy. A boy? - Yes, but he has a guardian. Good evening, Councilor Bellocampo. Elena! Why are you here at this hour? I was anxious to bring you news… that's very important to you. And for your grandson. You mean about Nicola? As you know, Counselor, the parliament approved the law. But only part of it, of course. The only part that counts. There's no denying it really is a special law. Nicola, it's already late. We'll finish the game tomorrow, eh? OK. Good night, Ma’am. Good night, Grandpa. - Good night, Nicola. Please, sit down. - No, thank you. Now, be so kind as to explain. You said it was important to me and him. How is that? Well, maybe it is important if it cost 3 men's lives. Now I know why they were killed. Really? Why? You don't know? Or are you still trying to say it was just out of homage for me? Yes, even if you don't believe it, at least the first time it was. My dear, among ourselves, a guest is still considered sacred. Even more so, if she's a lady. A young and charming lady. I remember the emotion I felt when you visited me. I didn't come to you to stir up any emotions! I know, you came only to talk about rent, squalid stuff, as if I were just a landlord. It wasn't your fault. I know how they speak of me. And I know why they say it. "Once upon a time, he owned this town." But now… it's been many years since they all thought that. So then you…? Please, listen to me. Sit down. - Stay right there! Don't touch me! What do I need to listen to? It's all clear. The first was killed because of what you said. But it created fear… and respect for me among the poor. Then the other two… because fear and respect must grow until it even reaches the powerful. And that… that naive, idiot Miss Bardi… was manipulated like a puppet, like a pawn. Move after move, in the most vile and inhuman way! By playing with my pride, my emotions, everything! Even with my ideas! And the poor with no water, no electricity, rats, toilet pits in the middle of rooms, drudges sick in bed, the misery, the hate, the hunger of the desperate who trusted in me! Don't pity them. They don't deserve it. They'll keep living like that because that's their nature. You don't understand them. They've been like that forever. They'll never change! Why do you hate them so much? Nuccio! Prepare a lamp for me and make sure it's working. And go open the gate that's facing the forest. These planes were called "flying fortresses". They could fly up to 9000 ms, carrying 10 men and 5 tons of bombs set to drop on our cities. A few months after the war ended, I saw it coming out of nowhere, low in the mountains. It was being chased by two small German planes trying to shoot it down. I was in the vineyard, at the top of the hill and I begin to shout, "Shoot them down! Kill them!" Suddenly it fell down, brushing the house and… it's remained here ever since like it just fell. There was a patrol searching the countryside to find it. I had it said that it flew towards the hills, beyond the valley. Come. It's just like it was then. Oh, Lord! Why did you do this? What does this mean? For him. I fool myself that this plane and these people had come to fall… and die exactly here to avenge him. A human sacrifice! How can I stop thinking about a boy sinking in the sea, and maybe who took an hour, a day, to die! Maybe he was asking for help and you don't know where he is! For many days, I thought… of killing myself: throw myself out a window or maybe shoot myself in the head. But I told myself, "Hold on. When there's a war, somebody must die, or else… they may enter our homes and walk all over us." But then… I saw the people cheering the American tanks, as they entered our towns but I… I could only see my son's body… continuing to sink, deeper and deeper into the sea… farther and farther away… The day the armistice was signed, they began to ring all the bells, and the peasants, as if they were mad, filled the square. Most of them came from Fiumara, they shouted and cursed! They ran into the church and broke the glass of my brother's tomb, the podestà! They dragged his body to the square and tore it to pieces. It was like they had no other wish, no other thought for so many years and this was their… their liberation! And you ask me why… why I hate them so much? So I locked myself behind my windows, and remained there for 30 years and I'll remain there forever. But I know when I'm gone, there will be another Bellocampo. Right now… he's just a boy but one day, my grandson Nicola, one day… will be me, and my brother. Of course. There must always be a Bellocampo in this place. No more of this, Miss Bardi. I agree. Are you going to kill me here, or should I expect it at home? What are you talking about? You represent no danger to me. Your theories are insane and completely absurd, with no logical basis. No one will want to listen. No evidence, no witnesses. Yes, Piturro! The jacket! The jacket didn't belong to a child. Goodbye, Miss Bardi. Goodbye, Councilor Bellocampo. Great! Piturro saw the killers. That's why he wanted to see me. That's what he wanted to tell me. But he hasn't got the courage. But he will speak. I'll make him talk. Help! Come out! Help! Come out! They killed Piturro! Come out, they've tricked you! No houses and hospitals! Take to the streets! Take to the streets! You have been fooled! Nuccio… How foolish. Even you who were born here, Nuccio, know nothing of this place. Here the guest is sacred. English subtitles by sineintegral@KG.
