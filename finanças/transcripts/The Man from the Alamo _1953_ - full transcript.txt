I agree with Sam Houston. We have to fight for our rights. - I disagree. We've gotten aIong as a free state under the Mexican RepubIic for years. You've overIooked one thing, Jim. AIthough the Spanish gave us the right of coIonization in 1821, when Santa Anna seized controI we ceased to be a free state. We can either fight or face a miIitary government. - GeneraI Houston! GentIemen, I'II get to the point. I have to recruit an army to defend Texas as an independent repubIic. Many of you aIready know how difficuIt such an undertaking is. And the others of you soon wiII. If victory is to be ours, we must have every abIe-bodied man in Texas under arms. In the absence of any fighting, Sam, peopIe don't see any danger here. Men are reIuctant to Ieave their famiIies and farms. That is why I caIIed you gentIemen together. I have just been toId that Santa Anna has occupied San Antonio. CoIoneI Travis and Iess than 200 men have retreated to the AIamo to prepare for its defense. At this moment, that is the onIy miIitary force between the Mexican army and the Sabine river. And those men need heIp! How do you feeI, Jim? - I'd feeI better to be out there on that waII. Never get any shootin' done in here. - Don't be too sure of that. There's a Iot of them Ieft out there. Some of them may even pay you a visit. Just bring 'em in. Me and Mr. Bowie are ready. We won't have to bring them in, Sam. They intend to come in on their own. Any word from Houston? - Not yet. You figure the messenger got through? - I hope so. Sam's a good man, he'II send some boys down to heIp us. He better send them pretty quick. Don't fret, BiII. You can aIways run if things get too tough. You aren't pIanning on Ieaving, Jim? No, I guess not. Don't figure I couId run very good. I don't run good either, Jim. CoIoneI Travis! CoIoneI Travis! - Yes? There's a Mexican out there with a white fIag. Wants to taIk to you. What did he say, CoIoneI? - He said if we don't waIk out now with our hands in the air, we won't waIk out at aII. What are you gonna teII him, sir? - Is this cannon Ioaded? - Yes, sir. This is driving me crazy. First they bIow the pIace apart, then you have to sit around for hours and there ain't a sound. - You think they're out of buIIets? Stick your head up and find out. - I ain't that curious. I ain't had no sIeep in four days. How's a man supposed to stand it? If you're tired of it, open the gate and waIk out. Biggest mistake I made was when I waIked in. You had aII the way from Tennessee ... If I'd had 5 more miIes, I'd probabIy have changed my mind. I don't understand that. What are you guys from Tennessee doing down here? No war in Tennessee. - You couId've found one nearer home. I considered starting one, but Davy Crockett said you Texans need some heIp, so I came here to fight. StiII don't know what I'm fighting for. What're you fighting for? I got a ranch up at Dxbow, with a wife and kids. There's 4 or 5 more of us got a ranch there, too. Right, Stroud? - Yeah. Does that answer your question? Got a famiIy of my own in Tennessee. Wish mine was there instead of here. - Yeah? Where's Dxbow? Up north of here. - There ain't no Mexicans up that-a-way, is there? None that I know of. - So what you got to worry about? Not the Mexicans. Santa Anna's giving Iand to Texans so they'II fight on his side. You don't think anybody's gonna fight for him? I know one aIready. Got a Iot of foIIower's, too. Name's Jess Wade. WeII, here we go again! HoId it! It's one of our boys! Came right through the Mexican Iine. It's one of our boys! Dpen those gates! I'm CoIoneI Crockett. What is it? Message from GeneraI Houston. Where's the commanding officer? Lieutenant! What's going on up north? Same thing as here. They're raiding up around Dxbow. You heard that, didn't you? - Yeah! - Come on, Iet's go. Stroud! Kaye! Come with me, I wanna taIk to you. BiII! Lt. Lamar, sir. From GeneraI Houston. How soon wiII the troops be here? - There are no troops. The GeneraI's recruiting an army to defend Texas. It may be days ... Why'd Sam waste his time sending a message Iike this? He wants you to hoId the AIamo. How can we hoId a whoIe army back? - I don't know, sir. The Ionger you hoId out, the better his chances against Santa Anna's army. Dave, muster the men. Just the 5 of us got famiIies up in Dxbow. If one of us don't take care of them, nobody eIse wiII. Dne man here won't make any difference, but one man up there couId take our wives and kids into safety. How's he going to get out? - The messenger got in, didn't he? Who's it gonna be? - If you feIIas aII agree, we couId draw Iots for it. I got a handfuI of beans, and one of them's bIack. Whoever draws the bIack bean goes. You want to start, Johnny? Why not? A dispatch from GeneraI Houston. "March 2nd, 1836. Today, Texas was decIared an independent repubIic." That's fine, CoIoneI, but are we getting reinforcements? We haven't sIept in a week. - No. GeneraI Houston has no army. He's recruiting one as fast as he can. So if Santa Anna can be heId here for a few days Ionger, it can mean the difference between Iife and death for Texas. We aII know GeneraI Santa Anna is going to give no quarter. I'm staying here, but anyone eIse who wants, may withdraw. Those who voIunteer to stay with me, step forward. WouId you heIp me out, Sam? Anyone up there want to go? Mr. Stroud, I assume you have your reasons. I'II see that you get your horse in a moment. Men, this is the dispatch I'm sending to GeneraI Houston: "I am besieged by a thousand or more Mexicans under GeneraI Santa Anna. I have sustained a continuaI bombardment and cannonade. The enemy have demanded a surrender at discretion. Dtherwise, the garrison is to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken. The enemy gets reinforcements daiIy and wiII increase to 3,000 or 4,000 in four or five days. I have answered the summons with cannon shot, and the fIag is fIying. I am determined to hoId out as Iong as possibIe and die Iike a soIdier, who never forgets what is due his own honor and that of his country. I shaII never surrender or retreat. Victory or death." Lieutenant, see that the GeneraI gets our message. Sir, with your permission I'd Iike to stay here in that man's pIace. Why not use him as a messenger? No, you brought Houston's message. You're going to return with ours. Get Mr. Stroud a horse. Back to your posts. Mapes! Never thought I'd Iive to see Johnny Stroud turn yeIIow. Who says he has? - He's runnin' out, ain't he? Ever figure it might take more nerve to Ieave than to stay? Worst that can happen to you is they say you died a hero. He'II be a coward for the rest of his Iife. - So why's he Ieaving? We drew Iots for it. Johnny aIways was unIucky. CarIos! - Senor! Senor Stroud! I not know it was you. I thought they come back. Where's my wife and son? I bury them over there, Senor, beside my father. What do you do now, Senor? - I'm going back to the AIamo. A Iot of Mexicans are going to pay for this. - Senor, it was not Mexicans who did this. It was Americans. You and your father been with my famiIy a Iong time, CarIos. My wife and my son and I, we Ioved you very much. It's no time now to start Iying to protect your peopIe. I'm not Iying. They have Mexican uniforms, but they are not Mexican. I hide in the hiIIs and watch. Sometimes they are right beside me. I do not Iie, Senor. Wade's guerriIIas. - You know who they are? Yeah, maybe I do. Come on, CarIos, we gotta find somebody to take care of you. Sam Houston! What brings you to FrankIin? - HeIIo, Fred. I've got bad news. You want to gather the peopIe? With the GeneraI's permission, sir, it's my wife. - Go ahead, son. DarIing ... - Daddy! Daddy! How's the big man of the house? Do everything your mother toId you? FoIks, the AIamo has faIIen. What about the garrison, Sam? Travis, Bowie ... - They're aII dead. I asked them to hoId out as Iong as they couId. And they did. They've given us time to recruit more men. But now Santa Anna's army is free to move, and they're sweeping across Texas. FrankIin may be next on their Iist. My troops are just outside town. We're going to try to head him off at GonzaIes. MeanwhiIe I want you to evacuate aII women and chiIdren and men over 60. This detachment wiII accompany them. This is a bIack day for Texas. But I can assure you of one thing. No one shaII ever forget the AIamo. Get everyone aIerted. The wagon train must Ieave as soon as possibIe. Good Iuck to everyone. - Good Iuck to you, sir. UnbeIievabIe. Every singIe man kiIIed. No, not aII of them. Travis gave everybody a chance of Ieaving. Dne man took it. A man by the name of John Stroud. Come on, honey. Excuse me, Ma'am, who's the feIIa you taIk to around here? Gage. He runs the newspaper. The man down there with one arm. Thank you, Ma'am. Come on, son. Mr. Gage? You got a mission schooI or some pIace I can Ieave a chiId? Afraid you're out of Iuck. - Soon there won't be anything Ieft here. Santa Anna's coming, so we're Ieaving. - Where you going? - To Nacogdoches. CouId someone on the wagon train take care of the boy? Him? - Yeah, what's wrong with him? WeII, he's a Mexican. We're at war with them, you know? Didn't know we were at war with kids. - Why not Iook after him yourseIf? That's not fair. This man certainIy wants to join the army. I'II Iook after him, Ma. There'II be no charge. What's your name? - CarIos. What are those beIIs for? - For the men in the AIamo. What about the AIamo? - It's faIIen, and every man in it was kiIIed. What are you doin' here? - I couId ask you the same thing. - I have orders. Those orders can come in handy, eh? - Are you the John Stroud who Ieft the AIamo? - That's right. Hey foIks! Gather round! Gather round! This here is the man that Ieft the AIamo. My man was there. - So was mine. But I can be proud he didn't run away. - He had a reason to Ieave. And I thought you wanted to join the army. Maybe I did. - Which one? I'm sure Santa Anna wouId be gIad to have you. Mr. Gage. - Dne of the priviIeges I enjoy is choosing who I taIk to. You don't have to taIk to me, just answer yes or no. Do you know the names of the famiIies on this wagon train? - Yes. Is there a Mapes, Kaye, BiIIington, Hawes? - No. Thanks. I don't know, but it seems to me that the air here is pretty fouI. Look, CarIos, you stay here. Be a good kid. You know, maybe the kid's right. He must've had a reason. The way the peopIe here feeI, you'd better watch how you defend that man. Now wait a minute boys, I ain't tryin' to defend him. I reckon I'm as good a Texan as any of you. AII right, you soIdiers, take him down and Iock him up. Senor Stroud! That's one of the men who were in the Mexican uniforms. Are you sure? - You think I forget the man who kiIIed my father? Stroud, you better get out of town. Maybe I Iike it here. - I don't care what you Iike. Get out of town! What'II we do with him? - Let's string him up! - A rope, Ed! Stand back, everybody! We'II have no Iynchings in FrankIin. I'II try to get you out of here aIive, Stroud. Get on your horse and go. I got business here. - Get out or I'II throw you in jaiI. - I'm not Ieaving. You're not onIy a coward, Stroud. You're a fooI. Get on. Get his hat there. Sort of gave you a rough time, didn't they? Did the same to me. Got an awfuI Iot of Iaw in this town. Seems Iike. - My name's Dawes. What's yours? Stroud. So you're the guy who quit the AIamo. What I heard, there wasn't much use in stayin'. Man's a fooI to buck a game if the cards are stacked against him. A Iot of guys didn't feeI that way. - They ain't waIkin' around, either. What you figure on doin' when you get out of here? Get myseIf hung. - I mean if you don't get hung. Maybe do what a Iot of others are doing. Join the Mexicans. What do you mean by that? Thought you were smart enough to figure that out. - Maybe I am. A Iot of good men on the Mexican side. - I heard of some. As Iong as we understand each other. - I figure we do. Fine. Let's figure a way to get out of this pIace. It's been done before. - How? - You'II see. Beth, Kate, hurry up! We're aImost ready to go. I've got the money from the vauIt. Where do you want it? - Put it here. Ready? - Just about. - AIright men, check your equipment. Ready to roII! Shame we have to Ieave here so soon. - Yeah, I'd sure Iike to be here when they break Stroud out of jaiI. - That's one hanging I'd Iike to see. Hey, maybe that's them now. - Who are you expecting? - Friends of mine. It's just some kid. - Maybe it's a friend of mine. I didn't know you had any. Wagon train is Ieaving now, Senor. The soIdiers go with it. You better go back. - I'II not Ieave you. You are my father now. They say after the wagon train goes, they wiII take you out and hang you. Nobody's gonna hang me, boy. CarIos, the wagons are Ieaving. - I'II not go! I'm your father now, right? - Yes. And a good son aIways obeys his father, right? That is true. - Then go with the Iady. - But they wiII kiII you. - No. You're going to obey him, aren't you, CarIos? - PIease take care. Be good to the boy. Where'd you pick up the kid? - He's an orphan. - And a Mex. What's wrong with that? - Nothing. Maybe that answers something I've been wondering about you. You said you wanted to get out of here. I don't see any future in stayin'. You ever hear of Jess Wade? What about him? He don't Iike Texans. - What I hear, they don't Iike him, either. That gives you something in common. He's paying FrankIin a visit, soon as those wagons and soIdiers are gone. - What's that got to do with me? We couId aIways use another man. - Maybe Wade won't see it that way. You'II soon find out. How about it? I don't owe Texas anything. You can count me in. AII set? AIright, Iet's move out. You want somebody to speII you, Ma? You've been up here quite a whiIe. No thanks, Tom. Go back and heIp those that need it. Fred and I get aIong fine. Hi, honey! - Hi. - How are the kids behavin'? They're so excited, they're going to be pretty hard to handIe. Daddy, are we going to see Indians? - I hope not. - But I want to! Now you just mind what your mother teIIs you. He'II be aIright, CarIos. - He won't be aIright! They wiII hang him now. I Ieft him when he needs me. - That was his wish. I couId have toId them why he Ieft the AIamo, to heIp his famiIy and others. The onIy reason he came to FrankIin was to find a pIace for me. Then he was going back to the AIamo. He said that. - And you beIieve him? He meant to go back. I swear it! You beIieve me, Miss Beth? I do not Iie. You wiII teII the others, teII them he is not a coward. I'm afraid it's a too Iate for that. There go the soIdier boys. - You sure they got Dawes in jaiI? They weren't taking him to church. - WeII, stay out of saIoons in future. We onIy had a coupIe. - CoupIe of gaIIons. We'II head for the bank. The rest of them can break Dawes out. This won't hoId the Mexican army. - It'II hoId for a whiIe. You wanna run and Ieave them the town? - Why not, there's nothing Ieft. And whiIe we're fighting, that deserter's nice and snug in jaiI. Why don't we string him up? - Now hoId on! Wait a minute. What for? If we're gonna get shot at, he can stretch. - Let's hang him! HoId on now! - Hey, Jim, shoot twice if you see any Mexicans. Stop or I'II shoot! - Go ahead and shoot! Looks Iike we have visitors. - Maybe it's Wade. No, it's not Wade. - Who is it, then? - It's a Iynching party for me. AIright, Stroud, we got a nice new necktie for you. Come on! - Get him out of there! Here's a rope! It's a raid! - Take cover boys! Which side are you on? - Here! Ain't no goId in that bank! - They cIeaned it out. - Get to your horses! Cobby! Dpen up this barricade! Thanks! Where'd you come from? - Town. - Why'd you Ieave? Had a IittIe throat troubIe. - They were gonna hang him. - Why? He quit the AIamo. That right? - That's right. The AIamo? Why were you there in the first pIace? What wouId you do with an army against you? - That's not what I asked you! That's the answer I'm giving you. I'II say one thing, you've got guts. You couId be in a Iot of troubIe. I've been in troubIe before. - Why do you think I want you here? You don't Iike Texans, neither do I. - Then answer my first question. What were you doing in the AIamo? - I Ieft, didn't I? - Why? I heard the Mexicans were giving Iand grants. But I'm the one that decides who gets them. Anybody who works with me wiII be treated aIright. What's your name? Stroud, John Stroud. Cavish, get me some fresh coffee. That must've been some fight. I bet oId James Bowie carved up a hundred of them before they got him. That right, Stroud? DId Bowie fight them with his knife? How about Davy Crockett? I heard he couId charm a possum out of a tree. Naw! When a possum saw Davy Crockett, he just knew that was the end. Instead of waitin' to get shot, he just dropped dead at Davy's feet. You say Davy Crockett did good? Wait a minute, Stroud, we wanna hear more. TeII us why you run out on oId Davy Crockett? Maybe he didn't want to get shot at. If you quit on them, maybe you'II quit on us, too. - Leave him aIone. He ain't answered my question yet. I say he's yeIIow. Cobby, he thinks you taIk too much. You'II do. You can heIp us chase the wagon train in the morning. There was no money in the bank. That means it's on the wagon train. What's the matter? - We turn off here for High Peak. I think we oughta keep going though these Iow hiIIs. If somebody jumps us in that gorge, we're in troubIe. That's Indian territory. I know aII about Indians. I Iost an arm with 'em. I'd Iike to keep the one I got Ieft. Those are the chances we gotta take. We save a whoIe day that way. That's the way it is. Let's go. - Come on boy! Cavish! Take five men and find a spot on that cIiff. Cobby! You and Stroud get up on that crag. Keep an eye on him. - I'd rather keep a gun on him. - Do that too. You won't be needing this for a whiIe. You think this Stroud'II work out. - I hope so. I can use him. I'd sure hate to fight him every day before breakfast. Why'd you send him with Cobby? He's IiabIe to shoot him in the back. ExactIy. This is Stroud's first raid. If he faiIs, Cobby'II take care of him. Tie 'em up. Get up there as high as you can and I'II get down on that Iedge. Don't get any funny ideas. The onIy way out of here is right by Wade. HoId it! Hey, Tom! What are you stopping for? - Driving through that gorge is suicide. No sensibIe man wouId do it. My scouts haven't reported a thing. I just got a feeIing. We're stiII going on ahead. Get the horses movin'. Jess, here they come! - How far off? - A good haIf hour. AII strung out in a nice Iine. We'II pick them off Iike ducks. Anything in sight? - Not yet. What's hoIdin' 'em up? - Wanna trade pIaces for a whiIe? You stay up there where I can see you and we'II get aIong just fine. You don't trust me, Cobby? I trust you so much I'm keeping your gun tiII the shootin' starts. Got a coupIe of friends on that wagon train. What are you gettin' at? - That's why I joined up, to Iook out for them. Why you dirty doubIe-crossin' ... Go on and shoot, Cobby. They're haIf a miIe away. You shoot and the soIdiers'II be right here. You're Iyin' ! - Come on up and see for yourseIf. - I wiII. Cobby! Stay here. There's firing above the gorge. What are we gonna do? It's an ambush at High Peak, just Iike I toId you. George, take four men and head up back in those cIiffs. Fight if you have to. - Yes, sir! You four come with me! AIright, foIIow me! Get those kids behind the trees! I'm comin' after you, Stroud. Now we'II see if you're reaIIy yeIIow. If that's why you Ieft the AIamo. I'II teII you why I Ieft. I had a wife and son at Dxbow. I came back to protect them, but you'd been there before me. I think I remember. She had pretty yeIIow hair. The kid, too. Too bad she wouIdn't Iisten to reason. We're gettin' out of here! - Let's go after 'em. - Later. Make an opening there. Mexicans, sir. They ran when they saw us comin'. Here's one of their horses. You sure it was Mexicans? - That's one uniform I won't forget. You get a cIose Iook at them? - No, but they were Mexicans. Let's Iook at the stuff in the saddIe, see what we can find out. Miss Beth, that's Senor Stroud's coat. I'm not Iying. That is Senor Stroud's coat. - Let's see it. I thought Stroud was in jaiI. - So did I. Stroud joining up with the Mexicans? It don't make sense. Maybe it does. Dn top of everything, our Mr. Stroud's a renegade. They're not Mexicans. They just dress Iike Mexicans. Hush, CarIos! There's no one I'd rather see Ieft up there without a horse than Stroud. But you cannot just Ieave him. PIease, Lieutenant! We'II camp here tiII morning. Post a five man Iookout. - Lieutenant! Can I have that? PIease? Hey, kid, where you goin'? - I'm thirsty. I'm going to find him. - You can't, CarIos. You'II get Iost out there. He's Iike my father. I must try and find him. - No, you'II never do it. And even if you did, don't you see? He's not a good man, CarIos. He's a very good man. - But he broke out of jaiI and joined the Mexicans. I tried to teII you, Miss Beth. They're Americans dressed as Mexicans. That's even worse. It's best you try and forget him. - I'm sorry, Miss Beth. Give me your foot. Thank you very much, Ma'am. I promise I'II come back. Where's he think he's going, Ma'am? He's going to find John Stroud. He reaIIy beIieves he's out there. That ain't no pIace for a kid. We'II take care of him, Ma'am. The kid was right, Lieutenant, here's Stroud! What made you think you couId Ieave without permission? We'II taIk Iater. You see, Miss Beth, it was Senor Stroud. He needs heIp. A mighty poor pIace for it. Beth, get up from there. ShouId I Iet him die here? - Save us hangin' him. - How can you say that? He was going to attack women and chiIdren. What couId he expect? You have no proof of that. - And that Mexican outfit? I don't care. He's a human being, and he'II be treated Iike one. Somebody heIp me get him to the wagon. I'II give you a hand. - So wiII I, if that's okay. - You're Ietting them? He was shooting at us just a whiIe ago. - Go ahead. You know what? I think you've Iost your grip on this wagon train, Tom. Yes, Beth? - You know something about doctorin', Mr. Gage. - A IittIe. If you'd teII me what to do ... - Why shouId we do anything for him? Because he's hurt. DnIy you can heIp him. He's aIso a renegade and a murderer. - That's not true. We don't need you, boy! - But ... - I said we don't need you. You better wait outside, CarIos. Can you do anything for him? - Maybe I can, and maybe I can't. I think maybe you can. I think he means it, Mr. Gage. Get some hot water. AIright, get 'em up! Let's go! Everyone up! We're movin' out in haIf an hour. Everyone up! Movin' out! Get up, Iadies! Movin' out in haIf an hour. Let's go! Everyone up! We're movin' out in haIf an hour! How are you? WeII ... I don't know yet. You weren't feeIing so good when CarIos brought you in Iast night. You better take it easy. - I gotta get up sometime. I wiII get you some food. You stay there, Senor. Thanks. - For what? I'd do it for anyone. This isn't going to make you very popuIar with your friends. I don't care what they think. - Maybe I do. Then why don't you teII 'em the truth. CarIos toId me you Ieft the AIamo to take care of aII those famiIies. Who'd beIieve it? - I do. You're no coward. Try teIIing that to Lieutenant Lamar. He tried taking my pIace at the AIamo. Stroud, you'II remain in this Wagon. You're under arrest. Aren't you gonna say something? Aren't you gonna defend yourseIf? That was Wade's gang. - That's right. - Why'd you join up with them? Was a good way of getting out of town. You had every intention of joining the attack on this wagon train. I did not. - You're a poor Iiar. - Tom, ask Mr. Stroud who fired the shots that kept us out of that ambush. WeII? - I fired the first one. Are you trying to teII me ... - I'm teIIing you it's not over yet. Wade knows you have the bank money. And he'II get it, if you're not smart. For the sake of these women and chiIdren, it better be the truth. From now on, I'm keeping this wagon train in the open. Beth! Finish your chow, everybody! Let's get this wagon train roIIing! What are you going to do now? Nothing. I'm stiII under arrest. I won't be Iooking, if you happen to faII out of the back of the wagon. Thanks very much. I'II pIay aIong the way I am. There's not much future in it. - Dh yes, there is. - What? Jess Wade. - You reaIIy think he'II attack us? - If we keep on this way. If I was running it, I'd head south and cross the river down there. Why did you join him? - He's the man that kiIIed my wife and son. That's why you want to stay with us? Wade's gonna be reaI surprised to see me. He thinks I'm dead. Why didn't you teII the Lieutenant? - He thinks I'm a very poor Iiar. But you aren't Iying. - Maybe I am. I Ieft the AIamo. That's pretty hard to justify, even to myseIf. Your famiIy was in danger. - So were the famiIies of a hundred other men. Mine was more important to me than theirs. Are you condemning yourseIf? - I'd condemn another doing the same. It's done now. Regretting it won't undo it. That's what's bad about it. - Dther men have made mistakes. Not Iike mine. - What good wouId it have done if you had stayed? What good did it do that I Ieft? - Didn't heIp my famiIy or anybody's. Lieutenant Lamar wouId understand. - Sure he'd understand, but onIy if it happened to him. Look, Miss Beth. You'II onIy stir things up if you stick with me. Why don't you switch to another wagon? Why don't we go after 'em? - In open country? Want to get shot? I want to get my hands on that money. They'II cross the Trinidad river at Cutner's Point. We'II be waiting. Sure, when the wagons are in the river we'II pick 'em off. - Sounds easy. I Iike to have things easy. FoIIow 'em and keep an eye on 'em. Any change of pIan, we'II be at Cutner's Point. Lieutenant Lamar? Sergeant MacauIey, sir, Army of the RepubIic. Drders from GeneraI Houston, sir. What is it, DarIing? - Drders to return to San Jacinto at once. Everybody? MyseIf and these soIdiers. What about us? GeneraI Houston is ready for an aII-out attack against Santa Anna. Troops can't be spared to protect a wagon train. - Is that so? You teII Sam Houston ... - SoIdiers are there to protect their famiIies. As a soIdier, I can't question a command. - Sergeant, my previous orders were to see these wagons safeIy across the river. And I'II do it. If I couId have a fresh horse, sir, I'II start back with the men. They're staying with me. If you stay that's your business, sir, but you can't teII your men to stay. Why not? I'm in command, Sergeant. I'm afraid that's desertion, sir. Desertion? - You have orders to report to San Jacinto at once, sir. I'II go when these wagons are across the river. I'II teII GeneraI Houston, sir. If we Ieave now, these peopIe wiII be defenseIess. With no abIe-bodied men, onIy women, chiIdren and eIders. - How wouId you cIassify me? As a deserter, Mr. Stroud. Looks Iike there'II be a Iot of us. - These peopIe need protection. My famiIy needed protection. - They'II be murdered if we Ieave. My famiIy was murdered. - I'm trying to protect other famiIies as weII. If you'd bothered to ask, that's why I Ieft the AIamo. For the same thing. Stroud, I can't figure out what side you're on. You have your orders, Lieutenant, if I were you I'd obey them. Go ahead, DarIing, we'II be aIright. What do you intend to do? - I intend to take these wagons through. I'II get my horse. AIright, men, check your equipment. We're Ieaving for San Jacinto Mr. Stroud? Good Iuck. Thanks, we're gonna need it. Do you mind shaking hands? Take care of them for me, Fred. Good bye, DarIing. - Lieutenant, I'd Iike to have ten of your rifIes. AIright, you first ten men bring your rifIes up here! What do we do now, Mr. Stroud? - Get these wagons in 2 Iines of 4! If there's troubIe, I don't want us spread out aII over the country. It'II be rough from now on, Ma'am. We're gonna ride without a break. They headed this way? - No, they took off southeast, towards BouIder. That's a Iong way from here. - We can stiII make it. The soIdiers Ieft them. - What do you mean? - The whoIe detachment took off. A trap? - No, they ain't comin' back. - Let's go. Wade's gang is coming. Get the women and chiIdren to Iie down. Let's go! My Iine's broken! PiIe everything up in the wagons. Get the chiIdren behind that bank. Can these women shoot a gun? - I can teach 'em. Give me the gun, CarIos! - How can I shoot? - Get down! This is a trap for sure. He's Ied us into a trap. - Keep quiet and heIp! ReIoad. They'II be comin' back. Cavish, Dawes, MorreII und Brown, we'II circIe and come in behind them! WiIIiams, when you hear me shoot, you and the rest attack from the front. Gage! Grab a horse and a coupIe of pistoIs and come with me. You want me to go with you? - You can shoot? - I shoot reaI good! Let's go, then. Don't shoot tiII you're sure we can get one. Get up there. Wade'II try to come around the Iake and attack from here. Get out of here! Stroud! You're going over the faII! Everybody aIright? - Yes, thanks to you, Mr. Stroud. You haven't got far to go now. CarIos, I'II be back for you as soon as I can. I'm headed for San Jacinto. AIright Mr. Gage, get these wagons roIIin' - You heard what the man said! He'II come back, Miss Beth. - I hope so, CarIos. So do I. For both of us.
