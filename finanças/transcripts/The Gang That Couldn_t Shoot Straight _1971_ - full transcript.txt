TACTICAL UNITS OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ARE CONVERGING ON THE SOUTH BROOKLYN WATERFRONT. SOMEWHERE THE INFAMOUS KID SALLY PALUMBO GANG IS LYING IN WAIT, THE GANG WHICH DECLARED WAR IN BROOKLYN AGAINST THE FORCES OF GANG BOSS ANTHONY PASTRUMO, AKA BACCALA. SANDY VANOCUR IS READY TO DESCRIBE THE DAY TO YOU. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY FOR THE RAID HERE ON THE SOUTH BROOKLYN DOCKS. IN THE BACKGROUND IS THE VERRAZANO BRIDGE WHERE WATER BUFFALO WAS FIRST BURIED. MARSHALL STREET LOOKS LIKE A WESTERN STREET ON A TELEVISION STUDIO BACK LOT JUST BEFORE THE FINAL SHOOTOUT. CRUSADING D.A. GOODMAN HAD SCHEDULED THE RAID ON KID SALLY'S HEADQUARTERS FOR 9:00, BUT ONE MAJOR TELEVISION NETWORK HAS BEEN HELD UP. GALLAGHER, OUR WATCHES STILL RUNNING? YEP. COME, FELLAS, GIVE US A BREAK. JUST BACK UP. YOU KNOW, IF WE WAIT MUCH LONGER, BACCALA WILL BEAT US TO IT. DAMN. I GOT A LUNCH DATE WITH THE MAYOR. I WAS HOPING TO HAND UP PALUMBO'S HEAD ON A PLATTER. THEY'RE COMING NOW. THANK GOD. LET'S GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD. ALL RIGHT, MEN, DON YOUR EQUIPMENT. KEEP YOURSELVES SEPARATED. LET'S MOVE OUT! IT'S CLEARING UP HERE, AND THE RAIN'S WASHED AWAY THE SHIPYARD SMOG. I THINK WE'RE JUST ABOUT READY. YES, YES. THE POLICE JUGGERNAUT IS MOVING IN. ASSISTANT CHIEF INSPECTOR CORNELIUS GALLAGHER WILL PROBABLY CARRY THE BALL FOR THE POLICE, BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY INSIDE INFORMATION FROM THE KID SALLY GROUP. I HAVE HERE A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF SALVATORE AKA "KID SALLY" PALUMBO, MRS. CATHERINE AKA "BIG MOMMA" FERRARA, AND 55 JOHN DOES. I COMMAND ALL THOSE MENTIONED BY NAME TO SURRENDER PEACEFULLY OR BE PREPARED TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES. HERE. YOU BETTER HAVE THIS. NO, NO! DON'T MOVE! DON'T MOVE! DON'T MOVE! DON'T MOVE! DON'T MOVE! STAY RIGHT THERE! DON'T MOVE. DON'T MOVE. DON'T MOVE. DIDN'T YOUR MOTHER TEACH YOU TO KNOCK? ADVISE THEM OF THEIR RIGHTS! RIGHT? I WANT TO SEE THE D.A.! I'M THE D.A.! YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE A D.A.

GOD DAMN RIGHT, I WANT HER. SHE'S GREAT FOR THE MEDIA. WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO LINK HER WITH STUDENT VIOLENCE. YOU GOT HER. PUT HIM IN FRONT OF THE GRAND JURY. I'LL HAVE TO OFFER HIM IMMUNITY. YOU CAN PAY HIS FARE HOME, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. YOU'RE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE, MARIO TRANTINO, YOU KNOW THAT? INSPECTOR GALLAGHER WANTS TO PUT YOU IN JAIL. JAIL. ME? FOR WHAT?

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HE SPEAKS ENGLISH PERFECTLY WELL. HUH? HE SAID, "MOTHER, I KNOW THAT." I THOUGHT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A COOPERATIVE WITNESS. YOU CAN GO HOME NOW. NO GRAND JURY. WHY? I GUESS SOMEBODY CHANGED HIS MIND. WHO? MY GUESS IS YOUR BOYFRIEND. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? YOUR BOYFRIEND REFUSED TO TESTIFY AGAINST YOU. HE GOT THROWN OUT OF THE COUNTRY. OUT ON THE FIRST FLIGHT, AND GOODMAN LETS YOU GO. FIGURE IT OUT. IS THERE A MARIO TRANTINO ON A ROME FLIGHT TODAY? TRANTINO? TRANTINO. NO. I'M SORRY. CHECK WITH PAN AM. IT'S OVER THERE. YES, SIR.
