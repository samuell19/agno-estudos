Cabaré Filmes presents Première Brazil Rio de Janeiro Int`l Film Festival So? Everything OK? OK Shall we start? Yes. During the last rehearsals pay attention to the tempo. Remember what we said? Careful with the tempo, the breathing. Have I been losing it? Yes. Be careful with breathing, prosody, phrasing. Shall we? OK? Can you do that? Yeah, sure. Dress rehearsal is tomorrow, OK? Yes. So, let’s go. Stop, stop! Eros, dress rehearsal is tomorrow. You’re not ready. Good afternoon. Hi. Do you have burlap bags? Yes. What`s up? I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to. I’m a bit clumsy. Did I break anything? If you did, you’ll pay for it. OK, let me know. OK. Hi. You’re gonna have tea? Just start putting things in order. No, I didn’t go to rehearsal today. No, I’m fed up with everything, music, rehearsals, conductors, opera, theater, everything. You know, since he came back from Japan Yes, yes. I can deliver it. Tomorrow afternoon. Yeah. OK. That`s right. Stop, stop, stop. Eros, what’s going on? What? I’m sorry... You were late, you’re not concentrating, you can’t reach the notes. Well? Can we start again? Yes, please. Can we? I’m sorry. Can we do it again? Well, let’s go then. Yeah my friend. I wanna change my life, you know? Change everything. But it’s hard. Goodness, it’s really hard. Anyway, let’s get together this weekend? OK. OK. Call me then. OK. Bye. So, how is everything? I’m adjusting. Hectic this city, isn’t it? Would you rather have returned to our town? Sometimes I think I would, but you’d moved here and I’d left everyone in Japan and I chose to stay here with you. I like it here. I wouldn’t want to live there. Small towns are nice for a little while. When I used to visit my mom, I’d reach my limit quickly. I could stay for two days tops. You never returned after she died? Have you talked to your father lately? He doesn’t want to talk to me. Don’t you miss it there? No. You? Copa 181, good afternoon. Copa 181, good afternoon. Yes? Good afternoon. We open every day. What is your name? Paulo. Good afternoon. - Hey, how is it going? - Good. - Enjoy your stay. - Thank you. Hey, Nando. How are you doing? Great. Good day for you. - Be right back - OK. Hey, babe. How’s my favorite hottie doing? You’re so smooth, huh?! New girlfriend? Are you messing with me? What’s the problem, man? You know I’m married. Hmmm... sure. Newcomer? Just arrived. That’s what I asked. First time? It’s... the second. Nice to meet you. Leo. Nice to meet you. Hi, Johny. Hi, how are you? Very busy today? -Very. -And what will be the name today? Just Taná. Oh, put an H in the end just for a change. The hottie hot’s arrived? So gay... soooo gay. Hello, number 41. Thank you. Hi my love Tell me one thing You brought my money? Only that? I`ll give you more then Hot girl! You should quit being stupid and stop giving money to this hustler. You’ll see what’ll happen if anyone at the sauna finds out you’re having an affair with Leo. Shit will hit the fan. Yeah, I know. It’s fucked up. It’s hard to let go of a good dick. It’s not just that. I feel good when I’m with him. You deserve a real man, who pays your bills and not the other way around. You’ll end up old and broke. It’s not that bad. Yes, it is. You know what? I’m going to the bathroom. Wow, that’s fast! You’re right about Leo. I wanna know about that show tomorrow. You’ll be brilliant. You’ll knock them dead. Everything’s ready. I’m nervous, it’s like a have a million butterflies in my stomach, and goosebumps all over. I’m nervous, too. But it will be beautiful, sweetheart. It will. Leo told me I shouldn’t be jealous of him. Well, he’s definitely right about that. I think it’s kind of disgusting that he has sex with those faggots at the sauna. But he already did that before you guys met. OK, so now you’re defending him? Me? Defend this self-seeking hustler? I really want to kick him out of there. But you know life is not easy, right? I’ve gone through a lot of shit to become a transvestite, I got beaten up in the street, I was kicked out of my home, but I didn’t become a prostitute. That’s not common. But Leo is no good. He’ll take everything from you, and make you suffer. He has a wife, he has kids. Get rid of this evil spirit. You know what? I think you’re right! - Let’s drink! - Let’s get hammered! Yeah. Let’s end up in the gutter. Let’s go on a binge, get covered in shit in a ditch. Waiter, another beer! What are you doing out here? Looking at the moon. You’re high again. I thought I was gonna get a kiss. Hey, you have to respect me! Don’t turn your back on me. C’mon, give me my money. Go to hell, Leo. Don’t you tell to go to hell, you fucking bitch. Stick your hand into your fucking bag and give me my money. I`m ordering! OK. Give me! Come now! Now come here! Come here! What are you gonna do with that? Come! You almost hit my face, you crazy bitch. You’re a whore. You’re worthless. Bitch! You’ll end up alone, you fucking whore. That’s all I needed. Is there something you wanna say?
