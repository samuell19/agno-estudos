Before we went on our travels... We promised each other... That there was nothing that could happen to make us come back here. For Muay Thai boxers... That is the ultimate goal. During the boxing industries heyday, The amount of money bet on boxing was astronomical... Like sharks, to the scent of blood. The Boxing ring was home to gamblers... And transformed, into the office of gangsters at the same time... All orders came from outside the ring, even who won and lost. They had an Army at their command called "Siyan". Switch this with his... You really watch out for yourself, Yuan... Seriously Yuan, you and me are practically family. You've got to help me out with this. Other than Timuk, only Chinese can be family. I would like to eat some shark! Fixed fights, poisoning, and murder... All truths easily overlooked. Because of all this, the fight didn't always end in the ring. We had no idea how it would end. As for us, we had no idea how it would end. Hey! If we get caught, we could get kicked out of the camp. What Pao, I thought you weren't afraid of anything. You don't have to come if your too scared! Oh, here I am, Samoh is the name. My father was a fisherman like his father, and grandfather before him. They said that as I got bigger I could go anywhere I wanted. Dad Wanted me to be a fighter more than a gambler. So one day when I was a bit older, he let me try some betting. There's nothing left. I'm not a chicken! This is Piak. And was born in a whorehouse! It may be true that Piak couldn't spell his name right... But he sure could punch and kick. Go. The three of us were born and raised in the same place. We all dreamed of being Muay Thai Boxers. Because we thought that was the only thing that could get us out of here. Hey! Which one of you is the toughest! What's your problem? 12 Baht. Winner takes all. He is bigger. That doesn't mean anything, if he can't hit you. Watch yourself in there. Piak, come here, I'll give you the blessing. Sa-too... Sa-too... Sa-too... Hey Samoh, looks like your losing. Shut the hell up... If Piak wins, you'll have pay us double. If Piak Loses I'll make you eat Shit! Piak! There were the three of us. Pao, had the look of a Muay Thai Boxer. That's because he was the younger brother of a boxer. Grengsuk S. Chaiya. He is also the son of Tiew Chaiya. A famous Muay Thai teacher. Piak, you take a bit more, and then you will have him trapped, get him with the Elbow. Defend and attack. Go! Go Piak, go! Get him! Piak, get over here. Go! Pao! Get over here! I didn't teach you Muay Thai so you could go start fights with others. That's when we learned that Kru Tiew was fierce. But we also learned that he did those things to make us strong as well. It's probably because... He didn't want Muay Chaiya to be lost with him... he said that once. Chaiya is fighting and strategy, at the same time... Going over offense and defense internally. Remember that crouching does not mean its over. Just because the tiger is crouching, does not mean it has given up. Good, Pao! The hardest thing was sitting on the Groke. We had to smear powder all over our faces... And had to defend against all attacks. Kru Tiew would say over and over. "Don't let anything take the powder off your face!" Our hearts belonged to Muay Thai Chaiya. The sunset is beautiful, look at that red. Oh yeah? But the end of our happiness came much faster than we ever thought. We had no idea that... the arrival of Kru Tep that day, Was the sign of the end of Kru Tiew, and this Muay Chaiya camp. In order to escape some shady loan debts he started this Camp... He and Greng had to go to Bangkok to work off the debt. They want you to have all the amenities of a real Muay Thai trainer. You should really come to Bangkok... You will get what you need, and pay off your debts too. Good luck. Dad, let me come with you! No, stay here with your mom, then you can focus on your training more. Let's go, Greng. I love you all like my brother. All of you the same as Pao. Our grief did not end that day either. Dad! I understand that last night... ...if you die now, who will I live with! ...He went into the city to bet on the fight. Yes, but he didn't have money to pay. I see. Have you seen Samoh? Over there, I saw him going up that way. Hey Samoh! Don't do anything stupid! You bastards! Don't try to stop me! Be careful! Samoh take my hand! My Leg! Piak! Pao! Let me go! Or we will all die! I'm not letting go! If you go, I go too! I can't hold on! We never mixed our blood together, like in those movies. But, that event reinforced my belief that... ...the three of us would never abandon each other. Come on Samoh! After the Muay Chaiya camp closed. Piak and Pao... ...went on to become Boxers following what we were taught. And that was enough to get us by through our days. A letter from Geng! Open it! Quick! Quick! Read it! 'This letter is for the people at the camp that wrote me.' 'I am training for a fight at Rajadamnoen stadium.' Rajadanerm! 'Dad is good, how are you? ' 'And how about Piak, and Samoh? ' Good. 'Just focus on training Muay Chaiya.' 'You remember what I taught you right? ' 'A good fighter doesn't just use his punches and kicks.' 'If you love it as much as you tell me.' 'Then you have to practice hard.' 'Good fighters have to use their heads... ' '... and their hearts.' Are the sales going well? Sure are. Who's that? What a knockout! Hey Nurse! Could you bring your heart and give it to me? Sure... But wouldn't better if you took the dog out of your mouth first? Hey Pao. Her name is Siprai. She's the doctors daughter Really? Yep. Yeah... yeah... What? What is it? How about this... You scrub my undies and I'll tell ya a little bit... Samoh you... If you want to know details... then you've got to wash it all. And I will lay it all out. You know you don't have to do it at all... okay, give it here then. Hey! What's your name? It's Pao. What's yours? Siprai. Okay, so now we know each other... Go tell your friend not to bother us anymore. I'm going now. Hey sweet thing, hold on a sec... You in a hurry? Let go! Hey! Get your hands off her! Ouch! That hurts. Sit still! Is this what you wanted? Are you trying to make it worse? Hows that? You think your some kinda action hero? Just go "rush into battle alone". "Not afraid to die". Well if the "Damsel in distress" is worth it, then... Whatever... What? Hey Piak! Check out my new trick! What is it? I will show you, listen... Piak, Pao! You guys need to go get something at the temple! I have called you guys here today, ...because were going to have a Muay Thai event here at the temple. There is going to be a lot of important people here. People from all over Korat. These guys have done this before... We haven't. I heard that you two are the best boxers here... ...role models even. This is the guy you'll be up against. His name is Kian Matkwai. This guy is really good. Piak look! Siprai! Move over! Siprai. Now in the ring Piak Chaiya. And Kian Matkwai. Piak is inspecting the ring in the ancient tradition Kian looks un-impressed, and has written Piaks name in the dirt. It's going to be a battle... 'The fighters approach each other... ' You know... ...your going to die here... its too bad your mother, and father have to see this. Don't talk so much, I'm allergic to bullshit. Son of a! And that marks... Pao! Can Kian get up? Or has he felt the power of the Muay Thai Chaiya! He takes quite a hit but isn't down long... Strike and neither goes down... Piak listen to me he's only striking! You've got to use your defense to find and opportunity to strike! You can't give up, understand? Hey, Piak... You don't need worry... You fight well... Your Muay Thai Chaiya is fierce, and powerful. If you keep up the conditioning and training... You could be a first class champion easily! Thank you, brother. That was one of those moments... That would be with Piak forever. Stay close please! What is it? Siprai. If I go to Bangkok to follow my boxing career. Will you come with me? That's so sweet, do you mean it? I bought this for you, from this Chinese guy I know using the money I've been saving. I was waiting until now to give to you. It's nice but, it's dead... What? It wasn't dead when I bought it! That chink better take this back! And give me something that... you don't have to do that... right now its about 4 o'clock. It's the time that you asked me... Were stuck in this moment, and now... I'll never forget it. Thank you. That day I decided to sell the boat... So we could all get up to Bangkok. As for Siprai... I thought Piak was going to break up with her. Go. Piak! It's the best! Pao! It's a real gym! There's a lot of people... The enrollment fee is 500 dollars per person. 500? Really? You eat and sleep free... injury fees are something... that depends on the accomplishments well I think a thousand is good. And since my name is Samoh, if anyone hits the doctor. I can fill in. Oh Tiew... your Dad left, and was ordained as a monk a while ago. I'll let him tell you about your brother, Greng. Greng shot himself in the head. They said that he threw a fight. But he was poisoned. Now you should go back home. How can you say that dad? You abandoned me so long ago and now... I'm going to keep boxing, If Greng was still alive he would agree with me! List of Fighters! List here! Make your choice! List here! Get your list! Today its a battle of champions! Watch out for Pao and Wichaiut! Attack now! Piak and Pichit... Pichit moves in... Strike! Get him, Piak! Pao! Don't just take it! Again with the right, and again... What are you booing at! Don't know a fight when you see it? Don't just take it! He has to wait for the right moment, that is Chaiya style! If he doesn't want to do what I say, then just go home! Pao is sticking with the goods... a left punch, a high right kick another from the right... High kick to the neck! He goes down! What a great move! This is Pao's minute! Go tell Kru Thep. He's coming hurry Piak! Piak, Get him now! Fight! What the Fuck are you trying to do? Attack him! ...now this, fans of Muay... That's better, now the audience is satisfied. The next round is all yours! Just a bit more, for our camp, just concentrate! Samoh! There is blood blocking my... and... ...and I can't breath. You have to get the blood out for me. Samoh, take care of it. Are you serious? Yeah! Hurry! Hang in there, buddy. Come on, do it Samoh! Hold on, Piak! Is that better buddy? Better? Yeah. Just breathe slow. Doctor. The Ref is calling the ringside doctor... ...to check Piak's wounds... I'm fine Doc really! I'm good to fight. Your both worth the same amount to me now! What are you looking at? He can continue. Okay. The Ringside doctor says he can continue! You get out there now. Fight! Piak! What's wrong with you? Piak! Okay, Dallas I will show you how I teach him. He did very well. You will be happy, I guarantee. Show us Diamond. Are you okay with him? Good man... He boxes better than a Thai. I like him. Okay, this going to be enough money for you? He is the best. Don't worry, you will be very happy. Samoh? Take this money and bet it all on me. Are you sure? Isn't this the money for you and Siprai's apartment? Yeah that's all... what the hell am I supposed to eat with? Just do this for me. Don't worry, I'll win. Piak is down! He's Knocked out already! The Referee doesn't even count it! You threw away the last of the money! I don't work myself to death so you can gamble our money away! Do you think my life isn't on the line in the ring? If you don't shut up, I'm going to slap you! Oh really? I'm not going to shut up, go ahead and slap me! Can you do this Piak? Kru Thep is letting you fight too much. It's good to fight often. They see me here, they like my fights. Kru Thep said that If I do two more fights... He'll get me a fight at Rajadamnoen stadium. And today, just look at Piak's condition! He is not ready! 'Boxing fans raise your voices... ' Stop. '... Boo the stage! ' 'The Referee has stopped the fight! ' To your corner! 'The fans are not satisfied! They are booing louder! ' 'Throwing stuff on stage! ' 'The Referee grabs the microphone.' 'The Referee determines the fight has been thrown! ' Here is your money. I took out the cost of the shorts, the cape, and the cup too. The Ref said you threw the fight. But Coach? What are you saying? You saw him that day, he was still hurt. He didn't throw the fight! Coach, please give me another chance. I promise I will fight even harder then before. It would take thousands of dollars for that. Do you have it? What are you saying... Where are we going to get the smarts to make that kind of money? I'm sure if you throw a couple more fights... ...that may help your chances of coming back. I thought you loved Muay Thai. You ungrateful Bastard! Don't you dare talk to me like that! If your not satisfied go back to your pathetic little life! Your just going to stare at me? Get your ass out of here! You too! Get out worthless piece of shit! Go! Don't even do that! Worthless sons of bitches. Bastard! Piak! Samoh! Siprai. What are you doing here, what's wrong? Get your stuff, were going home. What? You think you can just come and drag me out? Just drag me back however you want, huh? If you want to go back, go back alone. Siprai... Siprai... Siprai. Did you guys think this over? I think... You should go apologize to Kru Thep. Hey, just shut up. Anyway, I'm finished with Muay Thai. But for you... You are the last of the Muay Chaiya fighters now. You have to continue. Hey, the train is leaving. Are we going or not? How about this, We came together, lets leave together. Dammit! No one is going anywhere! You know why Siprai doesn't want to go back with you? She doesn't want to live in some dirty slum. Its not just her, none of us want that. Its too bad my leg is messed up... I'm not going to give up this easily... like some dog running away with its tail between its legs... Where are you taking your stuff? Following my husband. I'm not going now. Don't ever do this again. I'm sorry... His name is Bae. I heard from some bookies that he opened a bar in the area. He probably has his illegal fights there too. Many people that lose their licenses come to him. He is kinda like a 'Wiseguy' He likes helping people. Hey get out of here you low-lifes! I better not catch you sniffin' paint here again! This is Wan. She is the star. She wants to be a singer, but she isn't very good. I don't know why the guys line up for her. Oh, Sweet! Don't be shy, c'mon! Sir, looks like this guy is causing trouble. Want me to talk to him out back? No. Yes, boss. So you want to come fight in my ring huh? Show me that you've got what it takes. Thanks. Hey Bae! What's up! You brought some new blood huh? How about putting him in with 'Monster Truck'? '... He went straight through the ground! ' If your Muay Chaiya is strong, we'll be rich. '... oh my this isn't very nice at all.' "Monster Truck!" 'We will now take a moment to get to know the next pair of fighters that are up against 'Monster Truck.' 'Noom Chaiya! ' 'Not nice at all, I don't think he will have any appetite after that one! ' 'After that, which side will you put your money on? ' Pick who ever you like, and bet it all! Awesome! Piak is the best! This just ain't right! Get off me. Bae, your the best! 'The man who turned the "monster truck" into a "Tuk-Tuk".' 'A new star is born! ' 'Noom Chaiya! ' I've been thinking it over. Since that day you came and visited, until... Until when, Dad? Until I contacted an old friend of mine Sayam. He saw you fight, and wants to support you. Under the condition that I am your trainer. Hey, Sayam! Kru Tiew! Hey! Your looking strong as ever! I heard that you are going to school, is that right? Yes. Ah, good. Don't Give up, keep up your studies, and your skills too. Don't worry about money, I will take care of that. Piak, you've become so good already. I'll bet that if the Chaiya camp hadn't closed. You would be even more famous than Greng was! Hey pal, I have a serious question. Are you really going to take those things into the fight? How about I make some cool swords, And you take those into the fight? "Atlas Carries world." "Giant catches Monkey." "Hunter Throwing Spear." "Breaking the elephants trunk." "Chaiya, Chaiya..." Hey Chaiya! This time, your dead! I bet it all on Chaiya. How much did you guys bet? Here is your cut, from the fights. Its all thanks to you, boss! If it wasn't for you, I don't know what I would do. You earned it yourself. This money from the fights can't be enough to live on. I think it would be better, if you guys came and worked with me seriously. What do you have in mind? If the ring is like a big house of Yuan and Timuk. Then Bae is like a mouse that keeps chewing their power line. He is the only guy who would dare set up a table on their turf. He is just doing the same thing they did. And that is where we come in. It all started with "looking for a victim". We would look for fighters who would be cheap to pay off. Usually, just involved gambling, and women. Other than that... we recruited new blood. Its common knowledge, amongst fighters, not to go running in secluded areas alone. Because, if there is anyone that is going to pay you to throw a fight, they will be waiting there. Except... When the fighters come to find us first. Where do your parents live again? Here... Half before. In the occasion they don't throw a fight. We are forced to drug them. You know what to do. "Rhino blow" gives us the best result. Slip it to 'em one day before the fight... Quick ...they never last. As for the guys that say they will but don't... We use the classic method. Open the door, cheater! Are you crazy? You think you can take me, asshole! You got a problem with me huh? You got a problem, asshole? I told you, didn't I! The sun is settling down- We will meet again... That Chinaboy was horny last night... This next song is dedicated- I couldn't sleep at all! To all the Isaan girls out there- "Isaan girl, waiting for love." I forgot to tell you... They were handing these out, I didn't know what to do with it. I thought maybe you should have it. "Singing contest." I got you! All you think about is, pussy. You said If I caught you, we would get it on! Piak take this... go home! He is not a fighter, but he likes to play games... For this job I want you to do something really severe. It's not that he is bigtime, or small-time, but he has always cheated us. What is he doing out there? I'm scared already! How much do you need? Asshole! Samoh! Come get this one! Why did you shoot me, it hurts! Go help him out eh? He is too noisy. It's just the jitters. It's always like this the first time. Can I sit here? What's wrong? Can I get a beer? Did you go to the tryout? Here I am a star. I can sing however I want, and it doesn't matter... It's better to dance anyway... don't have to think about anything. You want to try? Can I get an interview? What style where you just using in there? I just cant place it, but it's just like someone else. Grengsuk Chaiya right? This is his younger brother, you know? Is that right? Yes. Your fight well, just like him! Thank you. Give us the "Chaiya" stance so we can get some pictures. Yeah lets see it! Hey there! Its been a long time since I've seen a fighter like you. "Achusacoom" is the name. How do you do? I'm a columnist writing about the history of Muay Thai. I started writing after asking your dad a few questions. What has brought you here today? I just had to come support this young man you have been training so well. Here is my card. Hold on to it... If there is anything I can help you with, don't hesitate. I'm so happy to have the chance to witness your style in action again. 'Now the news' 'Last night, police officials discovered the body of a 40 year old man, that had been shot.' 'The body was discovered in the forest behind the Nongbalai temple.' 'In the town of Paengsen, Nakombatom province.' 'The body was shot once in the head, and once in the body.' 'Officials are reviewing evidence, that suggests the death of this man... ' '... may involve an underground gambling ring, and fighting circuit.' Hey, you all right? How have you been? This is just like when we were kids. Isn't it? Yeah it is, lets go to my house, to drink some more! Alright... What's wrong! Rickshaw! Go get some booze for my friend here. If Piak hadn't had gotten so mad then, He would have been a rich fighter by now. Of course... why didn't he go down the same path as you? Siprai... Here, I tailored some clothes too. You dress so shabby, around here it's important to look your best. You can have me, if you want... I like you. But Wan, I have a wife already. Does your wife know what type of work you do? Would she accept it? I don't mind. How could he do this? It's not true... Hey, something has happened. Last night, Yuan sent some guys to my place. Another underground ring, he made them give the place to him. I have to give him a cut now. So now he knows of how much I make on this. That son of a bitch, is moving in on my area again. With amount he gets from Yuan and Timuk, all their gambling money. And the bastards still moves on me. Who, boss? The boss of that Chink gang called "Uncle Buu" I've eaten with the bastard before. It's the same guy that Yuan works for, everyday! He gave the Bar to Soydee, Uncle Buu's No. 2, and only nephew. Soydees' guys will do anything for him. Bastard has a bunch of trained killers with him. Especially those two fuckers last night. They are the most despicable of all. Catch this! How did you find this place? I have a better question... What are you doing here? You don't need to be spending your life like the rest of this scum. Think of Siprai! Calm down... Were all buddies. Don't think that I don't know, about her going to live with you! Yeah? And what of it? If I were you, I wouldn't be doing this to myself. If you want my wife, go ahead and take her! I've used her up already, I'm done with her. Stop! Let me go! Pao! I'll stay here, where I belong. Now you, go back to where you belong! So be it, Piak! I'm done with you! Let me go Samoh! Pao! Lets go, quick! After that day Piak and I knew. We were moving further and further from being professional Muay Thai "fighters". That the only thing we could be was "gangsters". Your bleeding internally! Just hold on! A straw! Just hold on! A bit longer! Yuan knows, I sent the two of you to shoot his ass. You shouldn't have missed. What are you going to do? I'm going to take him a peace offering. I don't do anything for anyone but Timuk. I think I want to eat some shark. Hurry get in! Timuk! Are you home? What do you want? How's it going? Sorry Timuk. After that Bae learned the true power of Uncle Buu. He got the paint sniffers to do it. The ones that Bae chased away with his shoe. They did it for a pair of Levis each! Everything of Bae's fell to us. Except the ringside gambling. Because in this world. There could be only one man in control. Remember that nephew of Buu that Bae told us about? He sent some guys out to find us. Do you want to quit? If you quit, I will. You stay, I stay. Starting over for Soydee that day, was like committing suicide. But anyway... What does that mean to us anymore. You guys understand? From now on... Nothing will be the same. People change, like the days. We started working for Soydee full time. You went 'over there' again didn't you. Alright everyone, this should be fun... You just can't get over it can you. I'm happy for them. I'm actually glad they are happy together. I would like to invite Samoh! To come up on stage and sing us a song! Come on! Don't be sad buddy! I'm gonna sing you a song... I'm ready! Piak my friend... This song is for you! I'll see you in the morning. In the morning? Let me make a deposit first! Wan! Who did this? That guy, over there. Don't move! I've got something for you! Is 70,000 enough? I won't throw a fight! Get out of my house! Get the hell out! Get out! You, stop screaming! Samoh, you done yet? When you hurry, you really hurry. Hey, who is that? Hey, you guys! You just don't give up, do you? Who is that? Dig that a little wider while your at it. Who is it? Some dumb ass boxer. Hey Piak, don't beat yourself up. Your Chaiya style is really good. Keep practicing your skills. You could be the best fighter for sure. It didn't have to be this way. If only he had just thrown the fight. Heavy piece of shit! Piak I bought some Phad Thai! Pao is the winner after only 3 rounds! The Ref is Inviting the Captain of police on stage. Who is here tonight to present the Siam cup to the winner. Here is the champion of the Siam Cup Pao! You weren't kidding Greng, your brother really is a great fighter. So, tell me the truth Diamond. Are you worried about fighting this man? I'm not afraid of this monkey. Alright then, were on your side then. This match is considered the most important match... ...for fans of Muay Thai all over the country. Pao, how does it feel to be matched up with 'Diamond'? The foreign fighter who has won match after match against Thais? I think that my past 80 fights say it all. I'm one hundred percent ready for this match. Could I please get a picture? Sure. Please, come over here. Over the past five years, I've tried to do things right, for all of us. I love you. Will you marry me? Pao, if I was to re-marry. You would be my first choice. But I need some more time. All right, bye. What is it? Diamond overdosed. Son of a bitch! Why? The drugs were too strong. Last night, he almost killed a guy in the ring. The doctor took a look at him and said that he isn't ready... How about this... Even out the betting on both sides. After that, put our money on the Chaiya kid. You understand? They asked me to come talk to you, since I know you. Four hundred thousand isn't a small amount you know. Your dad doesn't have the ability to take care of this himself. I'll give it to you straight, he could get killed. What do you think I should do? I don't have that kind of money. Just throw a fight, should be enough. But, I swore to my dad I would never do that! Do you know how your brother Greng died? It was when your dad and I were running the camp together. Your dad was in debt way over his head. They were going to take the Camp. Your Dad tried to force Greng to throw a fight. But he wouldn't go for it. I didn't think Tiew would go so far, as to drug his own son. Greng was chased out of the ring. They said he had no honor. Dad! Greng, No! Look... Fighters will win some, and lose some. If you don't do this, Tiew doesn't stand a chance. Pao? I'm sorry I wasted respect on you for so long! You destroyed Greng! Now you want to destroy me! Is this why you taught us Muay Chaiya? Why! Pao, listen to me first! Pao, fight to your fullest. The bell signals round three! Diamond opens up with a left! Get your hands up! Left kick, right kick! Watch it! He goes down! Bastard! Is this it... could this be the end, Diamond goes to his corner, but what's this? Don't feel bad Tiew. Son of a bitch. Bastard trying to mess with me, huh? Take care of all these fuckers for me. Thank you we are here every Thursday! And this Thursday is teachers night. You shouldn't dwell on it, just look at me. I keep my gym open and mouth shut... Isn't that because I'm trying to keep Muay Thai alive? I haven't ever liked teachers. Why don't you like teachers. They teach us things. Things just keep changing cause the times change. Just let it go. I don't get it! Piak! What are you doing? Pao? Kru! Piak don't do this! Pao help me! What are you doing! Sorry, Kru. No! What is it? Can't we let this one go? I'll pay for it myself. Boss lost hundreds of thousands on that fight with diamond... You think you can cover that much? If you don't take it, Sen will do it regardless. Peek-a-boo! Come here! Let's go find Daddy. Birds to set free! Get your birds here! Birds to set free! Siprai. Samoh, who did you come with? With Piak. Siprai, wait! I need to tell you something. And I have nothing, for you. No! Stop! Pao! Piak don't shoot Pao! Siprai please don't get involved I'm going to get involved that's my husband! If it weren't for him I would have sold myself! If you shoot him, shoot me too! Are you going to shoot me Piak! Do it already! If your going to do it, do it now! Shoot! You've gone insane! Pao! We have to go, hurry go! Someone call a doctor! Someone call a doctor, now! Hurry! Out of the way! I'm very sorry, he sustained some serious injuries. We've tried everything we can. Your very lucky that none of the bullets hit any vital organs. It was a near miss. But your fathers wounds are worrisome. There is nothing left for me. There is nothing left for me to fight for anymore. Don't say such stupid things. Your dad is laying in there on his death bed! Kru Thep told me about what Dad did to Greng. What did that little rat have to say? Back then... Your dad was backing Greng he wouldn't allow him to throw a fight! Thep drugged him, then blamed it on your Dad. You have to have a re-understanding of your father. Tiew was the best fighter I ever laid eyes on. Dad! Dad! You can't come in here! What are you doing! Don't try to resist! Let me go! Don't try to resist! Let me go! Give it up! The doctor said, he was clinging to this when he came in. Dad! We have eye witnesses saying they saw two of you dragging Kru Thep out of the house. Who was your accomplice? I told you already, I was alone... After that fight... Diamond's value blew through the roof! No one even wants to challenge him. But I have the funds... I will arrange a rematch for you. I am truly gratuitous... That you still trust me. But... But I'm going to quit fighting. If your father could hear what you said. He would be rolling in his grave. Listen to me, Pao, This the last opportunity in your life... ...to prove that you didn't throw the fight. I never thought I would see you here. Neither did I. Listen to me, Piak. After Pao finishes this next fight. I've decided to marry him. He is a good person. I came today... Because I cannot live with the guilt anymore. Piak. The baby, is yours. I... Piak. I stopped the time, when we met. Forgive me for everything that's happened since then. Siprai... Pao... I want you to know the truth, about what's gone on till now. We never had the chance to walk the same path as you. You became a Boxer. And we became crooks. Piak knew all to well. That if Siprai had stayed with him. Her life would have been full of danger. That scene that she saw that time... was made so that she could leave without any remorse. Piak never forgot you. The S. Saiam camp was in debt to us. You were able to fight there and finish your schooling... You know how that was possible? It was covered by the money Piak made on gambling. He always knew... Your life had to be better than ours. You must believe me that, he wasn't trying to kill you that day. Do you believe in our friendship? If your going to do something, do it quick! Pao... We still have a really big job to do. You have to promise us... Promise that you will fight your best. The best in your life. You have to win the belt, for us. Then, we can all go back to the village. Piak! The fighter from Chaiya... Paopan S. Saiam Has fought 81 fights... I heard this Chaiya fighter is really good. Hey you used to be a Boxer right? Did you know him? Don't waste your question. If he knew a boxer of that level... He wouldn't have become some cheap assassin. ...this is a historical, must see fight. It's going to start in just a few short hours. Its a re-match, and middle weight championship bout, at Rajadamnoen stadium. Good luck Pao. You thought about it right? About what's going to happen if Pao wins the fight? Soydee is going to kill him. Piak. You have led me since we were kids. Its my turn to be the leader. Lets go! Soydee knows I went and talked to you in jail. He's had me followed everywhere. He is so paranoid... He doesn't even know me. You still need to watch out for yourself. I don't need to use this anymore. I grabbed these for you. If we go through with this. You know what will happen right? You know what? I thought I was going to die, at the cliffs that day. But I didn't. I'm really happy. Because at least I have you guys... That made it all worth while. See you at the village. Piak I thought about for a while. This is going to be our best chance to get rid of Soydee. Since there are going to be a bunch of "high rollers" at the fight. I did some snooping, and found out that none of his boys will be armed. Because even he knows he is being watched by everyone this time. Remember this well... We only have this one chance. I would to invite everyone to gather for the beginning of middle weight championship. For the belt of Rachadamnoen stadium. The champion in red weighing in this morning at 156 lbs. The 'Fighter from Hell'! Diamond Sullivan! The challenger in blue. Also weighing in this morning at 156 lbs. The 'Handsome Executioner', Paopan S. Saiam! Are you ready? The bell signals the first round! Diamond bursts from his corner like a demon from hell! But Pao is handling him beautifully. Compared to his form last time, he is on his game in every way. Pao has him on the ropes with a left, and a right, following the Chaiya style. This is the best we have seen! Compared to last time these fighters are almost equal. Pao has really brought the guns this time. Diamond isn't even defending... He is moving in on Pao, moving him right into the red corner. A left, a right... The bell signals the end and what a shame, already! Don't waste your energy Shut up! You will lose your strength! You didn't train me. Moving into the second round. At the start of this round Diamond is already showing some change! He is moving in again... moving in more fiercely with the Chabab style. A Front kick to the chest! Has to get back in the game. Diamond gets him to the ropes, and is thrown to the ground! This is Muay Chaiya! A left, a right! Oh my, this fight might just go to Diamond for sure! Bastard has crazy energy. Just watch your defense. Don't match him punch for kick. It's the third bell. They are both coming to the round even. Avoiding all of Diamond's punches. 'Alligator whips tail' but it doesn't connect! Diamond moves him to the ropes and attacks! He goes down hard! 1... 2... Corner! 3... He goes down! The Ref continues the fight! Okay... fight! Son of a bitch! If that Chaiya bitch wins... Kill both those sons of bitches. Hey its Piak! Go tell the boss! This is yet another important fight! The fight between Diamond and Pao. Boss you have got to get out of here, Piak is here, he is killing us all. A left, a right. What are you looking at Piak, you piece of shit! Bastard! Give me your gun so I can shoot this piece of shit. But you told us not to bring any guns! You bastard! There is an escaped prisoner. Get him! Payasong calling 760 I have an escaped prisoner. They are both down... oh man really these two fighters... these two... This doesn't look like anyone is going to regain anything. But what a huge event for two historical fighters! He is getting up! He is up, but can he continue? It's up to the referee! Throw your weapons down and let him go right now! Piak! Give up, put down you weapon! Piak! You can't go in there! Let me go, that's my husband! Piak! You cant go in there! I am his wife! Turn yourself in Piak! Give it up Piak! Please! There is no where to run! Give it up! Piak turn yourself in! Give it up! Give it up! Don't you think of me, and your child! Piak think of your daughter! Piak! Your Daughter! Give it up! Your safe now. Jack. No! Piak you cant die! Pao... You won right? I won... I won look! I won Piak, I won... You can't die. I'm not dying... As long as you continue to use Chaiya style. I will be with you. Piak. Don't die. Siprai. Your watch. It runs good now. I'm sorry... Piak. Piak... Piak no... Piak come back! Come back! Tje... the song is ready. Sayam... Sayam is going to be yours now. I understand. I will manage it for you. You will have to come back as the boss. But you have to help me out. What goes on in the ring is all up to you now. As for you, brother, you have to take care of Soydee. Think about it Samoh. Pao can come back to fight... You will have some money to use and Piak. If anything should happen to him. I will pick up his debt, every dollar, every cent. Even that for his wife and daughter, for the rest of their lives. Just ask yourself Samoh. How much do you really love each other? Translation by: BuccKeao Subtitles by: Jan De Uitvreter
