(peaceful music) - Do you ever wonder what happens to us after life? - No. - Why can't you ever be serious? - Come on. You know, I have. Doesn't everybody? - It's just so insane. You know, it's crazy to look at the world and just keep going on as we do. Death everywhere, drugs, terrorists. Even the kids are picking up on blowing the faces off of their classmates. But if it's not close to us we're safe. - What are you getting at Chels? - Well, what do you think? What happens to us after we die? - Well, no one's safe. Eventually, we just go straight into the ground. We get eaten up by worms. But eventually we come back as roses. Or we just get seared to ash. - So, no heaven or hell, huh? - No, I deal in what it is. Life is heaven and hell combined. When we're gone, it's over. - That's pretty bleak. - No, it's just real. You asked. - Fair enough. Well, I hope I go to heaven and you're not leaving me up there all by myself. I'm taking you with me. - Well, I love you too, honey. But I'm not too sure about that. The things I've done. Even if there is a God, I'm denied. Come on, let's get outta here, let's go home. (reflective music) - This isn't easy for me either, Scott. You have no idea how hard this is. For you? It's always about you. Always has been. - That's not fair. - Fair? What's fair about me devoting my life to you? You've ripped my heart out. You crumbled it, just tossed it in the trash, like, like some piece of garbage. Is that fair? You told me you loved me. You'd stand by me. And now this. Gone. - I'm sorry I hurt you. - No. - Being torn by a thorn hurts. This? You killed me. - I can't be with you, Scott. I wish I'd never even met you and broke your heart. - [Scott] No. - [Chelsey] I'm sorry, Scott. I have to go. (suspenseful music) - Chels. Don't go. - What are you doing? - Finish the job. - I thought you were stronger than this. I guess I was wrong there too. - You can't leave. (liquid splurting) (body thuds) (knife thudding) (thudding) (tense music) (thudding) (ominous tones) (creature growling) - This place. - Come. (unsettling music) (dreadful music) (body thuds) (kicking sounds) (body thuds) (tense dramatic music) - Hi. (unsettling music) - Where are we? - You are here, where we all go. A quiet place for the most part. Yet some of us do get rowdy from time to time. You'll understand the particulars soon enough, but there's something about you, which tells me that you knew this was coming all along. - So this is hell? - Hell? Hell is a pitiful place left for the average, I know, for I've been there many times. I do have my travels. Don't demean yourself. You were meant for this. - No. - Denial. That's usually the case around these parts, but things do happen. Usually unexpected. Everyone has their limits. Even I cannot see past the seventh fold. - I tried, I tried to walk the right path, live the right way. Doesn't that matter? I believed. - Belief is far from certainty. Is it not? - Why am I here then? What led me to this? (Man in Black chuckles) Why? Why? Why? After all these years that one never fails to give me the chuckles. Why? You know the answer, don't you, child? - Scott. (reflective music) (Scott sighs) (cutting sounds) (ominous tones) - About time. - McKlellan. held me. He needed last night's copy. - I don't give a fuck what McKlellan needed. You're late. - So far? - So far, dead cunt, found by hikers in hold. 1079, six minutes ago. - Sure smells like death. You know I bet they took her- - Shut your mouth. Snap your shots. Get the fuck off my crime scene, Sommers. You don't get paid to talk around here. - I'm lonely. - [Chelsey voiceover] Scott. (eerie music) (creepy music) (banging) (tense music) - What? What do you want? (gagging) (tense dramatic music) (phone rings) (ominous tones) - Finish the job, Scott. (depressing music) - [Scott Voiceover] I'm dead inside. Twisting and rotting. I can feel the maggots crawling throughout my core. Feeding off of what I used to be. Is this what you wanted, for me to suffer? You left me here to walk this path, alone. - [Chelsey] Scott! (knocking at door) (tense music) - Hi. Scott, right? - Yeah. - I'm Anna. - Yeah, come on in. - Before we get any further, it's 200 cash. - [Scott] Right. - Okay, now we can have some fun. Okay. We don't have to rush anything. Come, sit with me. You're quiet. I guess I should watch out, huh? - What? - Oh, you know what they say. About the quiet ones? - No. - You're kidding me, right? - No. (sighs) I can't do this. - That's up to you, Scott. We don't have to do anything. It's your money though. - Scott's not my real name. - Well, that makes two of us then. Anna's just the name I use. I can be whoever you want. Just say the name. - I can't. Please just go. - Chelsey? Is that it? Don't touch me. - Okay. I tried. I don't understand why you called. All right, do you mind if I use your bathroom before I go. (ominous tones) Well, I guess I'll be going. Sorry for everything. - [Scott] I'm sorry too. I'll get that. - [Anna] What are you doing? (blood splurting) (Anna gagging) (tense dramatic music) (eerie crackling) - Got what you need? (Scott) I have what I need. (beeping) $19.50. Thank you. Thank you. - Working hard. Huh? - Osmond. To what do I owe this pleasure? - I need some information on your Jane DOE. From the alley. - Alice Klebbe. - Her file's up, the rest is classified. - Classified? This is connected to my case. - Is that a fact or your latest hunch? Whatever. It doesn't matter. You're off limits. - You owe me, Peters. - I don't owe you anything, hot shot. You're out of jurisdiction and I am not giving you shit. I suggest you walk off before I cite you for interference. - Interference. - Trailing on my investigation. - I'm just here for the coffee. Best in town. Right? - Garbage. But that's your call. - Question the girl in there. I'll make mine. - You know you're fucking up here, Sandra. - So says the "pitbull". That kid that you killed in the Heights. How is that working out for you? - Cleared and justified. - That's what they say. (phone buzzes) You better take your business elsewhere. We're done. - (Osmond) Only for the moment, my friend. I'll see you soon. (phone rings) - Hey. - What? - I was just calling to tell you that I'm going to my mother's. I'm not coming home tonight. I will be spending the night there. - Again? Yeah, I get it. I told you not to call me with this bullshit. I'm busy. - I know Charlie. You are always busy. - I don't have time for this, Brenda. - You just don't care anymore. You don't care about us. I'm tired. Mostly, I'm tired of being alone. - Or just tired of doing absolutely nothing except run your fucking mouth. Yeah, well have fun with your fucking mother. - Fuck you Charles. (Osmond sighs) - Asshole. (pensive music) (ominous tones) (tense music) (unsettling music) - I'm lonely. - Hi. - You're back. - I got in at six this morning. I guess you left early again. - Yeah well, some of us work. Others play. How's your mother? - She's fine. - I'm sure she is now that she's running your life again. - She's helping me. - Helping you, right. That's more than I can say for you Charles. - What's more than I do, Brenda? Pills and booze? Or is it fucking someone else now? - Fucking someone else? What are you talking about? - You know exactly what I'm talking about. - No, I don't. How dare you accuse me of being unfaithful. All I do- - What did you just say? - [Brenda] Nothing. - No, no. You just did. Sit. Go on now, say it again. - I can't. - Say it! - I can't. - How dare you? That's right. (punch thuds) - [Brenda] I can't anymore. (Brenda screams) - No. No one can help you, Brenda. - Get the fuck off me. - You want your mommy to help you? Is that it? She can't help you. No one can fucking help you. There's only one way out now. (thudding) (ominous tones) (unsettling music) - I knew you would come along. And look at you now. Already holding. Well done. I knew there was something special about you. - I never wanted any of this. - We never get what we want. - Only you do, right? - My hands are clean in the matter. - You used Scott. - No, the path we choose is our own. You walk yours alone. Scott, as you call him, is lost. - What do you mean, Scott? What do you mean? A name is a name. I've gone by many myself and never held attachments to any of them. Except for one. - Who are you? - It doesn't matter. The point is you. It is you. - Or is it this? Is this what you want? - No, but it's a start. - Start of the end. - End? This is only the beginning! I would love to chit chat further, but I do have business elsewhere. You'll find your way home sooner than late. Time fades all. We all reach the clearing sometime. (ominous music) - Why did you leave me? Why did you leave me here? (suspenseful music) (deep sniffing) (knocking) - Hey, do you know when the next train is? To the city? The ticket doesn't have a time on it. - The schedule should be posted. But yeah, the train should be here around 10:15. You have to switch in Hoboken or Secaucus depending on where you're going. - [Scott] Yep. - Where are you headed? - I don't even know. - No? - No. - You're funny. Figure it out as you go, huh? - Pretty much. But, that's where I'm going. - Well, you don't want to get lost. The city is a big place and it's not always safe. - Nothing is. (voice on PA garbles) (ominous tones) - Do you know this guy? - No. - But I know you, Scott - [Scott] Who the hell are you? - Will you excuse us, please? - No. - Fine. We'll deal with you later. Right, Scott? Stupid bitch. Put that away. And leave. Now! - [Scott] So? What now? - We'll get to that. Get up. We're gonna take a ride. You're good. Not that good. (unsettling music) - What is this? - What the fuck does it look like? This is a gift (Nancy whimpers) - You're fucking crazy. - Right. Four dead sluts in as many days. What does that make you, Scott? Yeah, I know you. You had your chance to bail. But you got sloppy, stuck around. You fucked up boy. This stupid bitch here, she's your pass. Kill her and I'll let you skate. - Why? - 'Cause you're a regular Richie Ramirez. That's why. I've seen your work. I dig your style. You play with passion. I like that. Nothing but the best for my baby girl. Right? Go on kid, do your thing. - No. I won't. - Well, that's disappointing. (gunfire pops) - I'm going. Leaving - Really now? Where you going, Scott? (suspenseful music) - Home. (gunfire pops) (body thudding) (eerie music) - Goodbye, Scott. (dreadful music) - Where are we? - Come. (rock music) (ominous tones) Go on. Take it. There are no choices here. There is only one certainty. But once you cross in here...
