THIS TIME ON "VINTAGE VOLTAGE," MOGGY AND THE TEAM TRANSFORM A LANCIA FULVIA. BUT THEIR FIRST FRONT-WHEEL-DRIVE CONVERSION CAUSES PROBLEMS FOR WORKSHOP MANAGER TONY. THE GEARBOX MOUNTS ARE SO SLACK. YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH MOVEMENT IS THERE. THE OWNER WANTS THIS COOL COUPE TO RETAIN ITS UNIQUE CHARACTER. THESE WERE KNOWN AS QUITE A LIGHT AND NIMBLE-HANDLING CAR. AND HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S DESPERATE TO GET BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THIS ELECTRIFYING RALLY ICON. SO I'M QUITE EXCITED THAT THE FIRST LANCIA I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO DRIVE IS GOING TO BE ELECTRIC. HERE IN THE BROODING VALLEYS OF MID WALES, A REVOLUTION IS UNDERWAY. THESE CARS WERE ONE OF THE BEST-LOOKING CARS EVER. ICONIC CARS OF THE PAST ARE BEING GIVEN A NEW LEASE OF LIFE. SLOWLY THEN, SLOWLY. OWNERS WANT MORE POWER, MORE PERFORMANCE, BUT AT LESS COST TO THE POCKET AND TO THE PLANET. THE SOLUTION IS ELECTRIC. SO ELECTRIC CAR, AS SOON AS YOU PUT THAT PEDAL DOWN, OOH, YOU'RE AWAY. RICHARD "MOGGY" MORGAN AND HIS TEAM OF CUTTING-EDGE MECHANICS ARE TAKING CLASSIC CARS AND RE-ENGINEERING THEM AS ELECTRIC CARS FOR THE FUTURE. IT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE. IT'S PERFECT. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS AH, PEDRO, JUST THE MAN.YES, MATE. LANCIA FULVIA, DO YOU REMEMBER IT? OH, YEAH, BEAUTIFUL COUPE SHAPE, BRILLIANT AT RALLYING? LEGENDARY AT RALLYING. I USED TO RALLY, SO I'M SO EXCITED WE GOT ONE COMING HERE. GREAT HANDLING, FRONT-WHEEL DRIVE? YEP. NOT DONE A FRONT-WHEEL DRIVE BEFORE. WE HAVEN'T. IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE, BUT WE'RE ALWAYS UP FOR IT. ANYWAY, THE CUSTOMER IS HERE. HE'S CALLED JERRY. HE'S OUTSIDE. DO US A FAVOR. GO AND HAVE A CHAT WITH HIM. TAKE A BRIEF OFF HIM AND THEN COME BACK AND SEE ME. - GOOD. - ALL RIGHT. AWESOME. - YOU MUST BE JERRY. - I AM. HI. PEDRO. GREAT TO MEET YOU.GREAT TO MEET YOU TOO, PEDRO. NOW WHEN DID YOUR LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE FULVIA START? FIRST TIME I SAW THIS IN 1979, I THOUGHT IT WAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE CAR, BUT AT THE TIME, I NEEDED A BIGGER CAR BECAUSE I HAD TWO SMALL CHILDREN, AND I HAD TO BUY A FORD CORTINA, BUT THE LANCIA FULVIA JUST WOULDN'T GO AWAY, SO EVENTUALLY ABOUT 20 YEARS LATER, WE GOT THIS ONE. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. BUILT BETWEEN 1963 AND 1976, THIS FRONT-WHEEL-DRIVE COUPE HAS A BIG REPUTATION IN THE MOTORSPORT WORLD. ITS ADVANCED INDEPENDENT FRONT SUSPENSION, WHICH HAS ONE LARGE CROSS-MOUNTED LEAF SPRING, GAVE IT GREAT HANDLING. AFTER A MEMORABLE WIN AT THE FAMOUS MONTE CARLO RALLY, IT WENT ON TO SECURE THE 1972 INTERNATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP FOR MANUFACTURERS. THE BIG QUESTION IS, THOUGH, YOU'RE WANTING TO CONVERT THIS TO ELECTRIC. WHAT'S THE STORY AND THINKING BEHIND THAT? IT'S NOW MY SON'S CAR. HE DRIVES A TESLA. HE WANTS TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE THIS... - OKAY. - ...ELECTRIC. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS WHAT HIS AIMS ARE IN TERMS OF RANGE AND PERFORMANCE HE'S AFTER FROM THE CAR? CITY DRIVING AND WHATEVER REASONABLE DISTANCE CAN BE GOT. KEEP UP WITH TRAFFIC AND... HE DOESN'T NEED QUICK ANYMORE. - NO. - NO. AS LONG AS THE CAR STILL BEHAVES LIKE A FULVIA LIKE IT USED TO. SO WE WANT TO HAVE THAT BALANCE BETWEEN IT, YOU KNOW, ENOUGH RANGE BUT MAINTAINING THE FULVIA FEEL. YES. NOW I NOTICE IT'S RIDING QUITE HIGH. WELL, THE ENGINE IS OUT OF IT, SO THERE'S NO WEIGHT IN THE HE FRONT. SO YOU'VE ALREADY TAKEN THE ENGINE OUT, AND YOU'RE FULLY COMMITTED NOW TO TURNING IT INTO AN ELECTRIC CAR. - YES. - HOW ABOUT ON THE INSIDE? DO YOU WANT US TO DO ANYTHING ON THE INSIDE WHILE -- IT IS GOOD, BUT THE SEATS NEED A BIT OF CARE. I'VE GOT SOMEBODY IN MIND TO FIX THEM ONCE WE GET IT BACK HOME. OKAY, SO YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT. EXCELLENT. SO OUR JOB THEN, OBVIOUSLY DO THE ELECTRIC CONVERSION. WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU AS MUCH RANGE AS WE CAN WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE CAR. I THINK IT COULD DO WITH POWER STEERING BECAUSE, EVEN WITH THE ENGINE, IT WAS A LITTLE HEAVY ON THE STEERING. WE GET SPOILED NOWADAYS. ALL MODERN CARS HAVE POWER STEERING, AND YOU KIND OF FORGET THAT... THAT'S RIGHT. ...NOT THAT LONG AGO, THEY DIDN'T, AND IT REALLY DID TAKE A BIG DRAG TO GO AROUND THE COURSE. THAT'S RIGHT. NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANY EXPECTATION OF BUDGET? WHAT'S HE GOING TO GIVE US TO PLAY WITH? I THINK HE'S EXPECTING ABOUT 40,000. OKAY. IF YOU COME ACROSS THINGS THAT NEED DOING, JUST DO THEM. YEAH, I MEAN, WHEN WE ENTER A PROJECT LIKE THIS, WE NEVER KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE AROUND THE NEXT CORNER. IT'S GOT TO BE RIGHT AT THE END OF THE DAY. YES, IT'S GOT TO BE RIGHT.WE DON'T WANT TO CUT CORNERS. BUT I'M SURE WE CAN WORK WITH THAT KIND OF NUMBER. THAT'D BE GREAT. WELL, JERRY, IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL, ICONIC CAR. I'M SURE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT PERFECT FOR THAT NIPPY RUNNING AROUND TOWN AND JUST LOOKING REALLY COOL AT THE SAME TIME. THAT'D BE PERFECT. YES.WE NEED TO GET THIS CAR OFF THE TRAILER SO MOGGY CAN START HIS ASSESSMENT OF THE CAR, AND THEN WE CAN GET WORKING AND RETURN IT TO YOU WITH A NEW LEASE OF LIFE.GREAT. CONVERTING THIS CHARACTERFUL ITALIAN CLASSIC TO ELECTRIC WILL CHANGE THE WEIGHT BALANCE FRONT TO BACK. MOGGY AND THE TEAM HAVE TO BRING IT INTO THE 21st CENTURY BUT RETAIN ALL THE CHARM, PERSONALITY, AND HANDLING OF THIS DISTINCTIVE DRIVE. COOL. A LANCIA FULVIA. YOU DON'T SEE MANY OF THESE OUT HERE. GREAT, QUIRKY CAR. I LOVE LANCIAS FOR THE SOLE REASON OF RALLY CHAMPIONSHIPS. NEVER DRIVEN A LANCIA, BUT WOULD LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY, SO I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THIS ONE'S FINISHED. 1.3 ENGINE IN IT, AND I THINK THEY EVEN SQUEEZED ABOUT 90 HORSEPOWER OUT OF A 1.3 ENGINE, WHICH IS SAYING SOMETHING. THE CUSTOMER HAS VERY KINDLY TAKEN THE ENGINE OUT FOR US. WE'VE JUST GOT TO LITERALLY FIND A HOME FOR THE ELECTRIC MOTOR, SO OUR IDEA IS, WE'RE GOING TO PUT A HYPER 9 MOTOR JUST HANGING OFF THE GEARBOX, THE FRONT HERE. WE'LL NEED TO MOUNT THAT OBVIOUSLY. A HYPER 9 IS A TYPE OF MOTOR THAT WE USE A LOT. IT'S A VERY MODERN DESIGN OF MOTOR. IT'S A SYNCHRONOUS RELUCTANCE PERMANENT MAGNET MOTOR, WHICH IS QUITE A MOUTHFUL, AND IT'S A VERY THERMALLY EFFICIENT MOTOR, SO IT'S MORE EFFICIENT THAN MOST OTHER MOTORS LIKE INDUCTION MOTORS OUT THERE. IT'S A GREAT MOTOR. ABOVE THE MOTOR, WE'LL HAVE ALL THIS SPACE IN FOR BATTERIES. THERE'S A REQUIREMENT OF ABOUT 120, 125-MILE RANGE ON THIS, SO WE'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT AROUND ABOUT, SAY, 16 LG CHEM BATTERIES. I'M THINKING EIGHT AND EIGHT OR SIX AND A 10 AT THE BACK. SO THE INTERIOR LOOKS PRETTY GOOD TO ME. THE ONLY THING WE NEED TO FIND A HOME FOR IN HERE IS A STATE-OF-CHARGE METER, WHICH JUST TELLS YOU HOW MUCH CHARGE THERE IS LEFT IN THE BATTERY, SO I'LL REPURPOSE ONE OF THOSE BINNACLES IN THERE FOR A STATE-OF-CHARGE METER. THAT'S ALL WE NEED TO DO, VERY LIGHT TOUCH IN THE INTERIOR. LET'S HAVE A LOOK IN THE BOOT. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO A BIT OF SPACE IN HERE TO FIT SOME BATTERIES. THERE'S A HOLE IN THE FLOOR HERE WHERE THE PETROL TANK USED TO GO, SO WE CAN EITHER SINK SOME BATTERIES INTO THE FLOOR, OR WE CAN PUT SOME BATTERIES BACK THERE OR EVEN BOTH. IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE A PRACTICAL LITTLE CAR WHEN IT'S FINISHED AS WELL. SO I THINK THERE'S A FUEL FILLER CAP THERE, LOCKABLE AS WELL, SO PROBABLY HIDE THE CHARGE SOCKET IN THERE MAYBE. FROM THE OUTSIDE, YOU'LL NEVER KNOW IT'S ELECTRIC. I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO ACTUALLY DRIVING THIS ONE ON THE ROAD BECAUSE I LOVE RALLYING. I'VE DONE RALLYING FOR A LONG TIME, BUT I'VE NEVER GOT TO DRIVE A LANCIA, SO I'M QUITE EXCITED THAT THE FIRST LANCIA I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO DRIVE IS GOING TO BE ELECTRIC. THE FULVIA WAS BUILT AT A TIME WHEN CAR MANUFACTURERS WERE ALL EXPERIMENTING WITH DIFFERENT SUSPENSION AND ENGINE SETUPS. MOGGY HAS A PLAN FOR THE CONVERSION, BUT THE LANCIA IS A RARE AND UNUSUAL CAR, WHICH WILL NEED A LOT OF TIME AND ATTENTION. - ALL RIGHT. STEADY. - WE'RE GOOD. STEADY. FIRST JOB IS FOR EXPERIENCED MECHANICS PETE AND NEIL TO TEST-FIT THE NEW ELECTRIC MOTOR, BUT ACCESS IS TIGHT. OKAY. STEADY, STEADY, STEADY, STEADY. STOP THERE. STOP. I THINK THIS BOTTOM GEARBOX MOUNT'S GONNA HAVE TO COME OUT. IT'S PROVING A BIT OF A PROBLEM. LOCATION PROBLEMS. GETTING IN THE WAY, IT'S A LOCATION PROBLEM, SO WE HOPE WE GOT ENOUGH CLEARANCE, BUT IF WE HAVEN'T, TONY IS GOING TO HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING TO ALTER THE FRONT CROSSMEMBER. THAT BELL HOUSING ON THE GEARBOX IS QUITE FAR FORWARD IN THE ENGINE BAY, SO IF YOU GOT A BELL HOUSING THAT'S QUITE FAR FORWARD AND THE FRONT OF THE CAR IS HERE, YOU'VE ONLY GOT A LITTLE BIT OF ROOM THEN FOR A MOTOR. WORKSHOP MANAGER AND EXPERT FABRICATOR TONY IS CALLED IN. THE MOTOR IS SITTING ON THE BEAM THERE. THAT'S WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN. THINGS ARE STARTING TO LOOK A BIT IFFY. THE FRONT OF THE MOTOR IS FOULING A STRUCTURAL PART IN THE ENGINE BAY KNOWN AS A SUBFRAME. THAT MEANS NOW THE WHOLE FRONT OF THE MOTOR ASSEMBLY HAS GOT TO CUT OUT. THE MOTOR IS REMOVED SO PETE CAN TRY AND CUT A ROUNDED SECTION FROM THE STEEL SUBFRAME. ALL THE WAY. BUT THIS IS A STRUCTURAL PART OF THE CAR, SO ONCE HE'S MADE THE MODIFICATIONS, HE'LL ALSO HAVE TO WELD A STRENGTHENING METAL PLATE BACK IN. IN ADDITION, THE WHOLE SECTION WILL NEED TO BE GALVANIZED TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T RUST IN THE FUTURE. I'VE CHOPPED OUT THE FRONT SUBFRAME FOR THE CLEARANCE FOR THE MOTOR. NOW I'M GOING TO OFFER UP THE MOTOR AGAIN JUST TO MAKE SURE THERE'S ENOUGH CLEARANCE ON A DRY FIT. WITH THE SUBFRAME MODIFIED AND AN ADAPTER PLATE ATTACHED TO THE MOTOR, IT CAN NOW BE FITTED TO THE GEARBOX. SLOWLY, SLOWLY, SLOWLY. STOP. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS DROP THE HOIST IN A MINUTE AND CHECK THE BOUNCE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH BOUNCE I'LL NEED. THE MOTOR IS IN AND BOLTED UP TIGHT, PROBLEM SOLVED -- OR IS IT? BECAUSE THE GEARBOX MOUNTS ARE SO SLACK, YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH MOVEMENT IS THERE. YEAH, GOT ANOTHER BIG PROBLEM NOW. THE TEAM HOPED TO JUST BOLT THE NEW MOTOR TO THE OLD GEARBOX, BUT THE MOUNTS ON THE BOX ARE NOT UP TO THE JOB. TONY CAN MOVE THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY BY HAND, AND THIS AMOUNT OF PLAY WOULD LEAD TO HUGE VIBRATION, CAUSING INTERNAL DAMAGE TO THE MOTOR AND GEARBOX. FABRICATOR RYAN HAS THE JOB OF CREATING A BESPOKE MOTOR MOUNT TO SOLVE THE LANCIA'S PROBLEM. THE MAIN PROBLEMS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE WITH THIS CAR IS SPACE IN THE ENGINE BAY. THERE'S A LOT GOING ON. WITH NOTHING IN THERE, IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF SPACE. WELL, THAT FITS A LOT BETTER NOW. BUT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY PUT THE ENGINE-MOUNT PLATE, THE ENGINE ITSELF, AND THEN WE'VE GOT THE BATTERY BOXES, THE SPACE JUST DISAPPEARS, AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOU'RE WORKING WITH MILLIMETERS, NOT INCHES. THE LANCIA IS A LIGHT AND DELICATE CAR. IT'S GOING TO TAKE CAREFUL FABRICATION TO SUPPORT THE NEW 55-KILOGRAM ELECTRIC MOTOR, SO RYAN IS TRYING TO CREATE A CRADLE. IT'S GOING TO BE VERY, VERY CLOSE TO GET ALL THIS OUT IN ONE PIECE. THAT FITS WITH A COUPLE-OF-MIL GAP. IT'S TOUCHING THAT SIDE, SO, YEAH, IT'S CLOSE. AT LEAST I'VE GOT CLEARANCE TO GET THIS OUT AND UP. TO KEEP THE MOTOR MOUNT LIGHT BUT STRONG, RYAN IS ALSO PLANNING TO USE A TOP CROSSBAR. SO IT'S JUST GOING TO PUT THIS ACROSS HERE WITH A BEND IN IT, TWO WELDS EITHER SIDE, AND THAT WILL BRACE IT UP. IT'LL STOP THESE FROM MOVING, AND IT'LL STOP IT TWISTING AS WELL, SO THAT'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT STEP. RYAN USES A ROLL BENDER, A MECHANICAL JIG THAT COMBINES THREE ROLLERS TO BEND THE METAL BAR INTO A CURVED ARC. IT'S GETTING QUITE CLOSE. SHOULD BE NOT FAR OFF FROM HEIGHT. YEAH, ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE WAY THERE. YOU CAN'T SET AN ANGLE. THE TRICK IS TO GRADUALLY BEND THE BAR TO CREATE THE PERFECT CURVE. IF RYAN BENDS IT TOO FAR, IT'S TOUGH TO FLATTEN IT OUT AGAIN. YEAH. PERFECT. I CAN GET MY FINGER UNDERNEATH IT. THAT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH CLEARANCE, WHAT WE NEED. I CAN CUT THIS DOWN TO SIZE NOW AND FIT IT INTO THE CAR. OKAY. NICE AND FLUSH AT THE END, A GOOD JOINT TO WELD ON. PUT A FEW TACKS THERE, AND THAT'LL HOLD IT SQUARE. - SPOT-ON. - IT'S GOOD, INNIT? BASICALLY WE'VE GOT THE CRADLE REPLACED NOW. IT'S ALL TACKED TOGETHER. IT'S NOT GOING TO MOVE. WHILST WE TAKE IT OUT, WE'RE GOING TO WELD AROUND THE FOOT PLATE, AND WE'LL GET IT BACK IN ONCE IT'S WELDED UP JUST TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE, AND THEN WE CAN CARRY ON WITH THE INSTALLATION. WELL, THE HAPPY THING IS, I GOT IT OUT IN ONE PIECE. TO BE STRONG ENOUGH, THE MOUNT NEEDS TO BE BRACED, AND THAT MEANS THE PLATES NEED TO BE WELDED TOGETHER, BUT WELDING PUTS A LOT OF HEAT INTO THE METAL, AND HEAT CAN CAUSE DISTORTION. AFTER WELDING IT, IT'S PULLED A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN WE THOUGHT EVEN THOUGH I TRIED TO LIMIT THE HEAT IN THE BACK PLATE. THE ONE SIDE HAS PULLED MORE THAN THE OTHER, SO I CAN'T JUST RUN A SPIRAL BRAND THROUGH IT, SO I'VE GOT TO TAKE EACH SIDE DOWN SLOWLY. MEANWHILE AS RYAN STRUGGLES WITH HIS MOTOR MOUNT, WORKSHOP MANAGER AND CHIEF FABRICATOR TONY SETS TO WORK IN THE BOOT OF THE CAR. THE PLAN IS TO WELD A BATTERY STORAGE TRAY INTO THE SPACE WHERE THE FUEL TANK WOULD'VE BEEN. WELDING NEEDS A GOOD CLEAN CONTACT WITH THE METAL, BUT THE BOOT OF THE LANCIA IS COVERED IN UNDERSEAL, A THICK WAXY COATING DESIGNED TO STOP RUST. SO WHAT I'M DOING NOW, SOME OF THE UNDERSEAL IS REAL BLOODY HARD, AND IT'S LAPPED UP SO JUST NEED TO SOFTEN IT UP A LITTLE, TINY BIT JUST TO GET IT FREE. WITH THE UNDERSEAL REMOVED, TONY CUTS OUT THE FLOOR AND FABRICATES THE BATTERY STORAGE TRAY. YEAH, NOT TOO BAD AT THE MOMENT. SO THAT'S JUST GOT TO BE REINFORCED UNDERNEATH THEN AND CUT ALL THE OLD LIP OUT. THEN TWO BATTERIES ARE GOING TO FIT IN THERE, AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OUR BATTERIES AT THE BACK. TONY CHECKS THE BATTERIES WILL FIT USING MOCK-UP METAL BOXES. THAT'S JUST THE BATTERIES. WHAT WE GOT TO DO IS BUILD THE BOX NOW, SO WE NEED TO LEAVE JUST ENOUGH SPACE IN BETWEEN SO WE CAN GET THE BATTERIES LINKED UP, AND ALSO TO SECURE EVERYTHING DOWN, AND THEN WHEN WE RELINE ALL THE FLOOR, ALL THAT'S JUST GOING TO BE COMPLETELY COVERED OVER, AND THEN WE'RE JUST GOING TO UNDERSEAL ALL THE BOTTOM END THEN. BACK AT THE FRONT OF THE CAR, RYAN IS STILL GRINDING DOWN THE MOTOR MOUNT, TRYING TO GET IT TO FIT. IT'S NOT A MILLION MILES AWAY NOW. IT'S ON. NOW WE JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE FINAL HOLE POSITIONS IN THE RETAINING RING. I'VE DONE THESE HOLES EXACTLY 10 MILLIMETERS. THEY NEED TO BE OPENED UP JUST EVER SO SLIGHTLY JUST TO AID THE FITTING, REALLY. WITH THE ENGINE MOUNT FINALLY IN PLACE, RYAN CAN TURN HIS ATTENTION TO CONSTRUCTING BATTERY BOXES FOR THE FRONT OF THE CAR. TWO BATTERY BOXES TO REINFORCE IT. 408. OVERALL, THE AIM IS TO ACHIEVE A PERFECT BALANCE OF POWER AND WEIGHT. ONE, TWO -- TWO BAR. TOO FEW BATTERIES, AND THE FULVIA WON'T HAVE ENOUGH RANGE. THAT'S GOT TO BE ONE SIX TWO, I, D, ONE SIX FOUR FOR THE TOP. TOO MANY, AND THE EXTRA WEIGHT OVER THE FRONT WHEELS COULD LEAD TO PLOW ON UNDERSTEER WHERE THE CAR DOESN'T TURN INTO A CORNER, AND YOU LOSE CONTROL. JUST TRY AND WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN BECAUSE I GUARANTEE SOMEONE IS GOING TO SEE THIS AND GO, "OH, I'VE GOT ONE OF THEM. CAN I HAVE ONE, PLEASE?" SO IF EVER WE DO ANOTHER ONE, WE CAN GET IT DONE IN HALF THE TIME. WE'VE GOT THE BASIC SHAPE OF OUR BOX NOW AFTER A LOT OF MEASURING, A LOT OF SQUARING UP AND CUTTING A LITTLE BIT OF THE BODYWORK AWAY, MANAGED TO GET A SIZE NOW WHERE WE CAN FIT SIX BATTERIES. WE'LL TRY A DRY FIT IN THE ENGINE BAY AND SEE HOW IT GOES. THIS IS A TEST TO SEE IF THE PART FITS, HOW IT MIGHT BE MOUNTED, WHERE TO DRILL ANY LOCATING HOLES SO THAT LATER IN THE BUILD WHEN IT'S ALL READY TO GO TOGETHER FOR REAL THAT NO MISTAKES ARE MADE. - ALL RIGHT. - LET GO. NOW LOOK AT THE FRONT. RIGHT. HOLD THE BOX. DROP. TA-DA. TRY SHUTTING THE BONNET. YEAH. OH, YEAH. IN THE ENGINE BAY, THE SIX-BATTERY BOX THAT I'VE PUT IN IS THE BEST ONE THAT I'VE DONE TO DATE SO FAR, I WOULD SAY. IT REALLY DOES SUIT THE STYLE OF THE CAR. IT'S -- IT'S NICE. THE LANCIA HAS OLD-FASHIONED MANUAL STEERING. TURN THE STEERING WHEEL, AND THAT INPUT IS FED THROUGH MECHANICAL PARTS TO THE WHEELS. JERRY WANTS POWER ASSISTANCE, A PROGRESSIVE ELECTRONIC SYSTEM WHICH AUTOMATICALLY HELPS THE STEERING AT LOW SPEED AND GIVES LESS ASSISTANCE AT HIGH SPEEDS, SO PETE NEEDS TO GET THE STEERING COLUMN OUT OF THE CAR. SO WHAT I'M DOING NOW IS THAT I'M JUST UNDOING THE BOLTS THAT PINCHES UP THE STEERING RACK. WE'VE GOT TO SEND THE STEERING RACK OUT TO A SPECIALIST COMPANY WHICH WILL ADD POWER STEERING TO THE UNIT. A POWER-STEERING UPGRADE ON A CAR LIKE THIS ISN'T UNUSUAL, BUT IT WILL HAVE TO BE DONE BY A SPECIALIST, SO MOGGY NEEDS TO FIND AN EXPERT WHO CAN ADAPT THE STEERING COLUMN. HERE WE GO. OKAY, SO THERE'S THE ELECTRONICS, AND... THERE'S THE WHOLE THING. WORK IS GOING WELL, BUT A NEW JOB LIST HAS JUST APPEARED ON THE WINDSCREEN FOR TONY. I'VE JUST HAD THAT TURN UP ON THE WINDSCREEN OF THE CAR. I SHOULD'VE HAD THIS AT THE START OF THE BUILD. JERRY HAS HAD TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT. HE DECIDED NOW, ON THE LIST OF WHAT WE GOT ALREADY, I'VE GOT A COMPLETE CARPET REFURB SO BASICALLY A BRAND-NEW ONE, SO, YEAH, WITH THAT, WHAT I THINK I'M GOING TO DO IS CALL THE TRIMMERS AND JUST GET A TRIMMER TO JUST DO THE LOT FOR ME. ON PAPER, IT DOESN'T LOOK A LOT, BUT IN REALITY, THAT'S A HELL OF A LOT OF WORK. THE TEAM HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PULL OUT ALL THE SEATS AND SEND OFF THE OLD CARPET TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT. MEANWHILE, PEDRO IS IN EAST SUSSEX TO MEET NEIL, WHO IS A POWER-STEERING SPECIALIST. HE DOES SYSTEM CONVERSIONS ON CLASSIC AND MODERN CARS. COME THIS WAY. OH, NOW THAT LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY SPECIAL E-TYPE. AND IS THIS IN FOR POWER STEERING, I GUESS? - IT IS INDEED, YEAH. - WELL, THERE YOU GO. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED FOR THIS. BRING IT THIS WAY. SO, YES, WE TOOK THIS OUT THE FULVIA. YEAH. SO HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT TURNING THIS INTO A POWER-STEERING COLUMN, AND WHAT'S THE PROCESS? SO WE LIAISE WITH THE CAR, AND THEY WOULD SEND US SOME PICTURES OF THE COLUMN IN SITU SO WE CAN SEE WHERE THE MOTOR UNIT WOULD SIT ON THE COLUMN AND HOW IT'S ORIENTATED. SO THERE'S OBVIOUSLY, LIKE, A METAL BAR FROM THE STEERING WHEEL. IT GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH HERE DOWN TO THE STEERING RACK. THAT'S IT. SO YOU'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY CUT THAT STEERING COLUMN AND PUT THE MOTOR IN BETWEEN? INDEED, YEAH, WE'LL REMOVE A SECTION OF IT, CUT THE COLUMN, AND THEN WE USE A MOTOR SIMILAR TO THAT. IS THAT THE MOTOR? THIS IS ONE WE'RE GOING TO USE FOR YOUR LANCIA, YEAH. IT'S NOT TOO HEAVY. NO, IT'S ONLY A FEW KILOS.YEAH. THIS IS GOING TO GO IN THAT COLUMN. YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE FROM THE STEERING WHEEL THROUGH TO THE STEERING RACK A SOLID BAR, SO IF WE LOSE POWER, WE'RE STILL GOING TO BE ABLE TO STEER THE CAR. YEAH, IT WILL JUST GO BACK TO MANUAL THE SAME IT WAS PRIOR TO FITMENT. HOW DOES THIS VARIABLE ASSISTANCE DEPENDING ON THE SPEED AND JUST THE GENERAL INTEGRATION WITH THE CAR WORK? OKAY, SO I CAN GET STEVE TO ANSWER THAT FOR YOU. OKAY. STEVE DOES THE WIRING LOOM, ELECTRONICS AND SO ON. BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF POWER ASSISTANCE NEEDS TO VARY WITH THE CAR'S SPEED, THE SYSTEM REQUIRES SENSORS WHICH TELL IT WHEN THE IGNITION IS ON AND HOW FAST THE CAR IS GOING. SO FOR THE SPEED SIGNAL, THAT IS NOTATED BY THIS DEVICE HERE, WHICH IS OUR SPEED SENSOR. THIS SITS IN LINE IN THE SPEEDO CABLE BETWEEN THE GEARBOX AND THE OUTPUT ON THE SPEEDO. - AH, OKAY. - OKAY? THIS IS WHAT ONE WOULD LOOK LIKE. OH, SO THAT'S THE UNIT JUST THERE? YEAH, SO WE CUT THAT IN LINE TO THE SPEEDO CABLE, AND THEN THAT GIVES OUR ECU THE SPEED OF THE VEHICLE, BUT THE OTHER THING WE NEED IS, THIS IS A SIGNAL BOX. NOW ON A NORMAL COMBUSTION ENGINE, WE'D PICK UP THE SIGNAL FROM THE DISTRIBUTOR, BUT IN THIS CASE, WE CAN'T BECAUSE IT'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE, SO WE USE THIS, WHICH SIMULATES A PULSE FROM AN ENGINE TO SAY IT'S ON. WITH THE VARYING OF THE ASSISTANCE THAT THE UNIT GIVES BASED ON SPEED, WHAT KIND OF RANGE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE? OUR PARTICULAR SYSTEM WHEN IT GETS TO ABOUT 30 MILES AN HOUR WILL START SHUTTING DOWN FROM THERE SO THAT YOU DON'T GET VERY SENSITIVE STEERING AT HIGH SPEEDS. AND YOU GET -- DO YOU GET MORE ASSISTANCE AT THE LOWER SPEED? YOU'D GET MORE ASSISTANCE AT SLOWER SPEEDS AND LESS AT HIGHER SPEEDS. THAT'S SUCH AN ELEGANT SOLUTION. PEDRO LEAVES THE STEERING COLUMN WITH THEM. THE WORK WILL TAKE A FEW WEEKS. THE REASON WHY PEOPLE WANT TO CONVERT CLASSIC CARS TO ELECTRIC, THERE'S ECOLOGICAL REASONS, FOR INSTANCE, LESS EMISSIONS OUT OF THE TAILPIPE. THERE'S RELIABILITY AND MAINTENANCE BENEFITS, SO YOU'RE DRIVING A CLASSIC CAR, WHICH IS AS RELIABLE AS A MODERN CAR, AND WITH THAT COMES COST SAVINGS NOT ONLY BECAUSE DRIVING AN ELECTRIC CAR IS ABOUT FIVE TO 10 TIMES CHEAPER THAN DRIVING A PETROL CAR, BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE NOT PAYING FOR MAINTENANCE COSTS AND SERVICING ALL THE TIME. THE BIG BENEFIT FOR ME IS, IT'S JUST MORE ENJOYABLE TO DRIVE AN ELECTRIC CLASSIC CAR THAN IT IS TO DRIVE A PETROL ONE. SO RUST IS ALWAYS A DANGER ON '70s CARS, AND NOW WE'VE MODIFIED AND WELDED TO THAT SUBFRAME, THAT'S GOING TO BE AT RISK. MOGGY OFTEN HAVES TO GIVE PARTS EXTRA RUST PROTECTION. THIS TIME, THE WHOLE MODIFIED FRONT SUBFRAME IS BEING SENT OFF TO BE GALVANIZED. GALVANIZING IS A PROCESS WHICH USES A TOUGH NEW ZINC COATING TO DEFEND STEEL AGAINST RUST. PEDRO IS IN SHROPSHIRE TO CATCH UP ON THE PROGRESS SO FAR. RIGHT. HERE IS THE SUBFRAME, PEDRO. OH, FANTASTIC. - YEAH, LOOKING GOOD. - YEAH. WE'VE ALREADY BLASTED IT, SHOP BLASTED IT, AND WE'VE PUT SOME VENTILATION HOLES IN IT AND SOME DRAIN HOLES BECAUSE WE GALVANIZE ON THE INSIDE AND THE OUTSIDE. - AH, OKAY. - BECAUSE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A RISK OF EXPLOSION WITHOUT THE HOLES. - HOW COME? - BECAUSE SUPERHEATED STEAM TRAPPED IN THE PRODUCT CAN'T GET OUT. IT JUST CAUSES EXPLOSION. RIGHT, THAT'S NOT GOOD, SO WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. SO NOW WE NEED TO TAKE THIS TO THE HYDROCHLORIC ACID TO GET IT CLEANED UP. - WOW. - SO LET'S DO THAT NOW. OKAY. THE GALVANIZATION PROCESS NEEDS THE PART TO BE VERY CLEAN TO BE EFFECTIVE, SO THE SUBFRAME GOES THROUGH A SERIES OF TANKS, INCLUDING HYDROCHLORIC ACID. AND FINALLY IT'S DRIED IN A HEATED PIT. WOW, HERE WE GO. BECAUSE THIS IS QUITE AN UNUSUAL PIECE, SO THERE'S A POTENTIAL DANGER THAT WE MIGHT -- THERE'S DANGER WITH EVERY SINGLE PIECE THAT WE DO, BUT THIS HAS GOT MORE HAZARD TO IT THAN A NORMAL PIECE OF STEEL. YEAH.IT'S A BIT OF AN UNKNOWN REALLY. NEXT, THE WHOLE PART WILL BE HOT-DIPPED IN 450 DEGREES OF MOLTEN ZINC, BUT THIS IS A TENSE PROCESS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT 100 PERCENT SURE HOW THIS OLD PART WILL REACT. WE'RE GOING IN REALLY SLOWLY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S CLOSED SECTIONS. IF WE GO IN TOO FAST, THERE'S A CHANCE THE HOLES COULD GET BLOCKED, AND THE ITEM COULD START FLOATING, AND WE'D HAVE TO ABANDON IT. IT'S QUITE VIOLENT. THERE'S LOTS OF BUBBLES. YEAH, YEAH, THERE IS -- IT'S BOILING OFF, AND YOU CAN IMAGINE, WITHOUT THEM VENT HOLES, THAT SUPERHEATED STEAM, NOWHERE TO GO, AND THAT'S WHERE THE EXPLOSION COULD HAPPEN, SO VENT HOLES IN GALVANIZING IS VERY IMPORTANT. YEAH. IS THAT BATH PURE ZINC OR -- IT'S 99.9 PERCENT PURE ZINC. - WOW. - WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THE ZINC FOR AROUND ABOUT 4 TO 5 MINUTES PROBABLY. WE'RE WAITING FOR THE STEEL OF THE SUBFRAME TO REACH THE SAME TEMPERATURE OF THE ZINC. SO THAT NOW MAKES THAT COMPONENT CORROSION-RESISTANT. SO THAT'LL BE CORROSION-RESISTANT NOW FOR PROBABLY 50 YEARS. RIGHT, PEDRO. WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU THE HANDSET, AND YOU CAN LIFT THE SUBFRAME OUT OF THE ZINC. OKAY. HOT DIPPING CREATES A CHEMICAL REACTION WHERE A LAYER OF STRONG ZINC-IRON ALLOYS FORM ON THE SURFACE OF THE STEEL. COMING UP NICE AND STEADY. LOOKING LOVELY, ISN'T IT? YEAH, IT LOOKS NICE. THE BOYS ARE DOING A GOOD JOB. SO THE GUYS ARE KIND OF SCRAPING OFF THE TOP SURFACE? YEAH, THEY ARE. THEY'RE SKIMMING BACK THE TOP LAYER OF THE BATH TO KEEP IT NICE AND CLEAN. THAT STOPS ANY CONTAMINANTS GOING ONTO THE SUBFRAME, WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE NEED IT TO LOOK NICE. YEAH. IT'S LOOKING GOOD THOUGH. YEAH, THAT IS LOOKING REALLY GOOD. YEAH, THAT'S REALLY HARD. I'M JUST NOT PUSHING IT TOO HARD. JUST INCH IT OUT. THAT'S IT. HOLD IT. HOLD IT. THAT'S IT. AND THEN PRESS IT UP HARD. THERE YOU GO.YOU'RE A GALVANIZER. THE FINAL STAGE IS TO KNOCK OFF ANY EXCESS ZINC, AND GALVANIZING THE SUBFRAME IS COMPLETE. WE'VE DONE A LOAD OF WORK ON THE LANCIA SO FAR, BUT THERE'S STILL A MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB. WE'VE GOT TO GET ON THE POWER-STEERING SYSTEMS. WE GOT TO SWAP OUT THE LEAF SPRINGS. WE'VE GOT TO PUT ON THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS, THE INTERIOR -- THE LIST GOES ON. PETE IS TACKLING THE LANCIA'S SUSPENSION. REAR LEAF SPRINGS, WHICH FLEX TO ABSORB ANY BUMP IN THE ROAD, ARE FAIRLY COMMON ON CLASSIC CARS. BUT IT'S UNUSUAL TO HAVE A LARGE CROSS-MOUNTED LEAF SPRING ON THE FRONT. THERE WE GO. THAT'S THE ONE. FRONT LEAF SPRINGS OFF NOW. AND THERE IT IS. IT'S GOT TO BE UPGRADED TO HANDLE THE WEIGHT THAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT INTO THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE. THE REAR SPRINGS I'VE TAKEN OFF AS WELL, LIKEWISE THEY'RE GONNA BE UP-RATED, SO HAPPY DAYS. WAIT FOR THE PARTS. BUT RIGHT NOW, ANOTHER KEY PART IS ARRIVING AT THE WORKSHOP. - SURPRISE. - MINT. -FAIR PLAY. CHECK THAT OUT. NICE. LOOKS GOOD, DOESN'T IT? I'VE BEEN WORRYING ABOUT THAT. SO WERE THEY. THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BEND. WE WERE REALLY WORRIED BECAUSE IT'S GOT SO MANY BOX SECTIONS. THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT -- DID YOU SEE HOW MANY BITS ABOVE THOSE? SHH. YEAH, FAIR PLAY. THAT LOOKS GOOD. JERRY'S GOING TO BE CHUFFED WITH THAT. YEAH. GOOD. WELL, YOU GOT NO EXCUSES NOW, MATE. - CRACK ON. - CHEERS, BUDDY. - CATCH YOU LATER, MATE. - SEE YOU LATERS. NEIL WASTES NO TIME IN FITTING THE GALVANIZED SUBFRAME, AND THEN THE MOTOR CAN GO IN FOR REAL. LOOKING FOR A GOOD BALANCE SO IT'LL MEET UP WITH THE BELL HOUSING OF THE GEARBOX CLEANLY. - OKAY. - NEEDS TO COME OVER YOUR WAY. SO THIS IS THE FIRST FRONT-WHEEL-DRIVE CAR WE'VE DONE. - STEADY, STEADY. - WHOA. TO KEEP COSTS DOWN, WE DIDN'T DITCH THE GEARBOX. IT JUST MAKES THE JOB A WHOLE LOT SIMPLER, BUT THERE'S STILL CHALLENGES BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT THE MOTOR IS MOUNTED FURTHER FORWARD, SO SPACE BECOMES A PROBLEM. STEADY, STEADY, STEADY. RIGHT. NOW YOU NEED TO JUST LOWER IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE. OH, YES. YES. WE'VE GOT IT IN. IT'S JUST SLIPPED IN, A ABSOLUTE DAWDLE. THE MOTOR SLID IN EASILY IN DRY FITTING, BUT FOR SOME REASON, THINGS NOW DON'T QUITE FIT. ARE THEY THE RIGHT PITCH, THOUGH? I THINK SO. NO, THAT DEFINITELY DOESN'T GO IN. NO, OF COURSE. I KNOW. I JUST SEEN THAT. ON THE BOLTS, YOU HAVE PEAKS AND TROUGHS, AND THE PITCH IS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO PEAKS. ON A COARSER THREAD, ON A METRIC ONE, YOU'D BE TALKING ONE. THEN YOU GO FINER, 1 1/2. THEN YOU GO 1.25, AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM, SO... SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE... GOT A MIX-UP WITH BOLTS. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE. SOMETIMES, EVEN EXPERIENCED MECHANICS LIKE NEIL AND PETE GET CAUGHT OUT BY THE SIMPLE THINGS. IN THIS CASE, THE BOLTS WERE THE WRONG PITCH FOR THE BOLT HOLES. GOT THE RIGHT PITCH THIS TIME? YEAH. - YEAH. - IT WOULD APPEAR WE HAVE. GOOD. WITH THE CORRECT BOLTS IN PLACE, THE MOTOR IS NOW PERFECTLY SIGHTED. SO NOW THE MOTOR IS ALL INSTALLED, I'M GOING TO PUT THE MOTOR MOUNT IN. IT'S BEEN A BIT OF A STRUGGLE, BUT THEN AGAIN, WE ARE ATTACHING 21st-CENTURY TECHNOLOGY TO A 1970s GEARBOX HERE, SO NOBODY SAID IT WAS GOING TO BE EASY. THE NEW UPGRADED SUSPENSION PARTS HAVE ARRIVED, AND NEIL IS FITTING THE LANCIA'S LEAF SPRINGS DESIGNED TO TAKE THE EXTRA WEIGHT THAT THE BATTERIES WILL ADD TO THE CAR. NOW WE GOT TO SECURE THE AXLE TO THE SPRING WITH A SANDWICHED PLATE. IT WAS SANDWICHED ALL TOGETHER, SO TO DO THAT, WE NEED THE FOUR BOLTS. TO FIT THE REAR SPRINGS, THEY NEED TO BE OPENED UP A LITTLE TO REACH THE MOUNTING POINTS, WHICH IS DIFFICULT, AS THESE UP-RATED SPRINGS ARE EXTREMELY STIFF. TRY PUSHING IT AND EXTEND --PUSH IT FIRST AND -- STRETCH IT OPEN FIRST AND GIVE IT LIKE THAT. YOU CAN ACTUALLY -- BEFORE YOU DO IT... YEAH, JUST PRACTICE. JUST PUT THAT ON THE FLOOR LIKE THAT NOW. PUT IN BETWEEN AND STRETCH IT. ALL YOU'LL FIND IS THEN THAT IT'LL JUST START OPENING AND OPENING AND OPENING. BUT YOU GOT TO TWIST IT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BEFORE YOU'LL BLOW IT. YEAH, WELL, IT LITERALLY ONLY NEEDS A SMALL AMOUNT. YEAH. SO GO THAT DIRECTION FIRST. OKAY THEN. TONY SUGGESTS A HYDRAULIC RAMP, WHICH SHOULD PROVIDE THE POWER TO STRETCH THE SPRING. OKAY. IT'S GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. GO ON. GO ON. YES! YOU'RE IN. WHAT A FIGHTER. MOGGY HAS CALCULATED THE LOAD THE NEW SPRINGS ON THE FRONT AND REAR NEED TO TAKE, BUT HE WON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE UP TO THE JOB FOR SURE UNTIL THE BATTERY BOXES ARE LOADED UP. SORTED. ANOTHER KEY PART, THE NEWLY MODIFIED POWER-STEERING COLUMN, IS BACK AT THE WORKSHOP. PETE IS FITTING IT. IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE AN EASY FIT. IT'S BEEN MEASURED OUT WAY BEFORE, AND WE KNOW IT WILL FIT. THAT IS NOT GOING TO GO IN LIKE THAT. IT IS INCREDIBLY TIGHT IN THERE. YEAH, THAT'S THE FULL EXTENSION, AND IT'S NOT WORKING. BECAUSE THE COLUMN HAS BEEN MODIFIED FOR POWER STEERING AND AN ELECTRIC MOTOR FITTED, THERE NOW ISN'T ENOUGH CLEARANCE TO REFIT IT. IT'S TIME TO GET HELP FROM WORKSHOP MANAGER TONY. THIS COLUMN, SO YOU'VE GOT AN ADJUST ON THERE, SO THE COLUMN COMES IN AND OUT, YEAH? I'VE GOT ALL SPLINES LINED UP IN THE ENGINE BAY. IT WAS MISALIGNED, SO I GOT THE PIN IN THERE. I'VE GOT THE ONE IN THE COCKPIT. I'VE EXTENDED IT. THE FOUR HOLES WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO MEET, IT'S AN INCH SHORT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THE FOUR HOLES THAT'S MEANT TO MEET? - WHERE THE -- - THE COLUMNS? - WHERE THE COLUMNS... - BOLT IN, YEAH, YEAH. IT'S AN INCH SHY. THERE'S NO MORE ADJUSTMENT. YOU CAN'T -- IT WON'T FIT. I'VE GOT THE ONE ADJUSTER LOW, SO IT COMES IN AND OUT. YEAH. IT'S STILL 3/4 INCH SHORT. YOU'RE LOSING ME COMPLETELY. OKAY, SO JUST THERE IS THE ADJUSTER, YEAH? SO YOU CAN GET MORE RANGE, OKAY? YEAH. RIGHT. THAT'S THE FURTHEST OUT IT'LL GO, AND THOSE FOUR HOLES ARE NOT LINING UP, MATE, NOWHERE NEAR IT. IT LOOKS DRAMATIC, BUT THE ONLY SOLUTION IS FOR PETE TO MODIFY THE BULKHEAD SO THE COLUMN WILL FIT. HOPEFULLY THAT LITTLE SLIVER OFF WILL CURE MY WOES. WE SHALL SOON FIND OUT. WITH THE ACCESS PROBLEM OVERCOME, PETE CONNECTS THE NEW STEERING MOTOR TO A FEED FROM THE EXISTING 12-VOLT WIRING LOOM TO PROVIDE POWER SO THE SYSTEM WILL KNOW WHEN THE CAR IS SWITCHED ON. ALL THESE ELECTRICS I'M COLLECTING NOW, THE ELECTRICS FOR THE SHOCKS. GREEN, BLACK AND WHITE, GREEN, BLACK AND WHITE, ROUND, GRAY, LOVELY, JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED. JUST FITTED POWER STEERING IN THE LANCIA NOW. IT'S IN. NEXT JOB IS THE LANCIA'S HEATER, WHICH USED TO RUN ON HOT WATER FROM THE ENGINE, BUT WITH NO ENGINE, THERE'S NO HOT WATER. GOOD NIGHT. UGH. SO ONCE NEIL HAS REMOVED THE HEATER MATRIX FROM THE CAR... OKAY, TONE. THERE YOU GO. IT'S YOURS.EVERYTHING COME OUT RIGHT, YEAH? YEAH, NO PROBLEMS. ...TONY'S JOB IS TO CONVERT IT TO ELECTRIC POWER BUT IN A SYMPATHETIC WAY. WHAT I WANT TO DO IS KEEP THE ORIGINAL -- GET THE ORIGINAL ONE, PULL ALL THE INTERNALS OUT, AND THEN JUST SWAP IT FROM WATER TO ELECTRIC SOMEHOW. THE PAIN END OF THIS ONE IS, BECAUSE WE'VE TAKEN ALL THE INNARDS OUT OF THIS AND WE'RE USING ELECTRIC INTERNALS, IF IT'S TOO CLOSE TO THE PLASTIC, THEN YOU GOT TO WORRY ABOUT IT MELTING THE HOUSING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. TONY REMOVES THE OLD WATER RADIATOR AND REPLACES IT WITH A NEW ELECTRIC ELEMENT. YES, THAT'S A GOOD FIT. IT ACTUALLY FIT IN PERFECT. THAT CRADLE ACTUALLY SAT IN THERE. IT WAS THE EXACT SAME SIZE AS THE LANCIA MATRIX. JUST WANTS A LITTLE BIT OF A TRIM, AND THAT'LL FIT IN. JUST ONE MORE FLAT JUST TO GET BACK IN. SO SOMETIMES IT CAN ACTUALLY BE AS EASY AS THAT. SO WHAT I NEED TO DO NOW IS JUST BLANK ALL THAT OFF, BLANK THE MIDDLE, THEN BLANK THE BOTTOM OFF, SO WHEN THE FAN IS GOING, IT'S JUST SUCK IN AND DRAW IN DIRECT HOT AIR FOR THE ELEMENTS THERE, AND THEN THAT SHOULD WORK PERFECTLY. WE'VE MANAGED TO INTEGRATE THE ELECTRIC ELEMENT INTO THE ORIGINAL HEATER BOX IN THIS CAR, SO THE CONTROLS FOR THE FANS AND THE AIRFLOW IS STILL GOING TO USE THE ORIGINAL LEVERS IN THE CAR. THE IDEA IS TO KEEP THE CABIN LOOKING AS STOCK AS POSSIBLE. KEEPING THE GEARBOX MEANS RETAINING THE GEAR STICK ALTHOUGH ONLY ONE OR TWO GEARS WILL BE NEEDED. MARTIN IS TRYING TO FIND A PLACE TO FIT A STATE-OF-CHARGE DISPLAY INTO THE DASH. HE'S HOPING IT WILL FIT WHERE THE OLD CLOCK SAT. HOPEFULLY IT'S THE SAME DIAMETER, AND HOPEFULLY IT FITS. YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO CUT THAT. WHAT WE'LL HAVE TO DO IS SCULPT AROUND HERE THE SAME SIZE AS THAT, SO AS IT GETS LOADED IN, THERE'S JUST A SMALL, MINUTE GAP AROUND THE HOLE. WITH SOME CAREFUL MODIFICATION, THE DASH TRIM IS CUT TO SIZE, AND THE STATE-OF-CHARGE DISPLAY LOCATES WHERE IT SHOULD. WE'VE WIRED UP THE BATTERIES, AND THEY'RE INSTALLED IN THE BATTERY BOX, BUT THAT'S WEIGHING ABOUT 120 KILOS, SO I'M QUITE NERVOUS ABOUT GETTING THAT VERY CAREFULLY SLOTTED INTO PLACE. PERFECT. MOGGY ARRIVES TO OVERSEE THE FITTING OF THE HEAVY FRONT BATTERY BOX. ARE YOU GOING TO WATCH YOUR SIDE? - FINGERS. - YEAH. - ALL GOOD? - LOOKING GOOD. YEAH. IT NEEDS TO BE LOWERED VERY GENTLY INTO THE ENGINE BAY... SLOWLY DOES IT. ...SO NOTHING GETS CRUSHED. IT'S A TENSE MOMENT FOR THE TEAM. LET ME DROP IN. I CAN MOVE IT SIMPLY. I'VE GOT TO GET THAT OUT BEFORE I CAN MOVE IT. ALL RIGHT? OH, NO, NO. WHOA, WHOA. - JUST SLOWLY, MATE. - I AM. THAT THERE, THAT'S FINE. THAT'S ENOUGH. I DON'T WANT THIS BAR TO HIT THE BUSBAR. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY'LL FIND OUT WHETHER THE NEW LEAF SPRING WILL TAKE THE INCREASED WEIGHT ON THE FRONT OF THE CAR. GREAT.WITH TONY'S EXPERTISE, HE KNOWS CAREFULLY APPLIED PRESSURE ON THE FRONT WING SHOULD TELL HIM IF THEY'VE GOT THE RIGHT SPRING RATES. AH, LOVELY. THAT IS REALLY NICE. I'LL BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU. THE UPGRADED LEAF SPRING THAT WE SET UP FOR THE CAR, I WAS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT, IT DIDN'T LOOK RIGHT, BUT ALL THE MEASUREMENTS ARE GOOD, AND I'M VERY HAPPY WITH IT NOW, REALLY HAPPY. WHILE THE TEAM HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THE MECHANICS OF THE CAR, THE CARPETS HAVE BEEN SENT AWAY AND USED AS A TEMPLATE FOR A COMPLETELY NEW SET. NOW IT'S DOWN TO PETE TO FIT THEM. WHAT I'M DOING NOW IS JUST PUTTING IN A BIT OF SOUND DEADENING SO THE NOISE INSIDE THE CAR WILL BE LESS, BASICALLY. BEAUTIFUL, PROPER JOB. THE ORIGINAL CARPET WAS GREEN, BUT THE CLIENT HAS TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SWITCH TO A LIGHTER COLOR TO BRIGHTEN THINGS UP INSIDE THE LANCIA. SO THAT'S JUST BASICALLY TO HIDE THE HV CABLES AWAY. PETE IS USING CARPET FIX SPRAY TO STICK THE CARPET INTO PLACE. IT'S A THING OF BEAUTY, IF I DON'T SAY SO MYSELF. AH, MOGGY, OVER HERE. COME AND HAVE A LOOK AT THIS CARPET I'VE JUST FINISHED. - HOW'S IT LOOKING? - YEAH, IT LOOKS FANTASTIC. OOH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT, INNIT? YEAH, IT'S PRETTY GOOD, PRETTY GOOD. SWISH. I'LL BET YOU CAN'T WAIT TO DRIVE IT, HUH? YEAH, IT'S ALL READY NOW FOR ME TO DRIVE, INNIT? YEAH, IT'S GOOD TO GO, MY FRIEND, GOOD TO GO. - AWESOME. CHEERS. GREAT. - COOL. GOOD JOB. THE TEAM HAVE TRIED HARD TO KEEP THE ORIGINAL LANCIA CHARACTER, BUT WILL MOGGY THINK THEY'VE SUCCEEDED WHEN HE DRIVES THE CAR FOR THE FIRST TIME? I'M OVER THE MOON IN THIS CAR, OVER THE MOON. I WANTED TO DO IT CREDIT FOR ITS RALLYING HERITAGE, AND THE HANDLING HAD TO BE RIGHT. I THINK WE'VE TAKEN ALL THE AWESOMENESS OF A LANCIA AND JUST IMPROVED EVERY LITTLE ASPECT OF IT. IF YOU LOOK AT THAT DASH, YOU KNOW, YOU'LL STRUGGLE TO PICK OUT WHAT'S DIFFERENT. THE MODERN 21st-CENTURY SORT OF ELECTRIC HEATER SYSTEM IS ALL HIDDEN BEHIND THE DASH IN THE ORIGINAL HEATER MATRIX. IT'S OPERATED THROUGH THE ORIGINAL LEVERS ON THE DASH. IN FACT, THE ONLY THING YOU MIGHT SPOT IS THE STATE-OF-CHARGE METER, WHICH IS PURPOSED IN EXACTLY THE SAME POSITION WHERE THE OLD CLOCK WAS THAT DIDN'T WORK ANYWAY. WHEE! NICE LITTLE BIT OF POWER AS WELL. YEAH, I'M HAPPY WITH IT. BUT HAS THE LEAF-SPRING UPGRADE BEEN A SUCCESS? CAN IT DEAL WITH THE 288 KILOGRAMS OF BATTERY WEIGHT? BUT I WAS QUITE WORRIED, TO BE HONEST, BECAUSE THE GUY THAT WE USE, WE KIND OF TOLD HIM WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO ACHIEVE, WHAT THE FRONT WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION IS GOING TO BE, WHAT THE REAR WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION IS GOING TO BE. WE SENT HIM THE ORIGINAL SPRINGS, AND HE TOOK A EDUCATED, EXPERIENCED GUESS AT WHAT HE THOUGHT WE'D NEED, AND THAT'S ALWAYS A WORRY. DOES THE GUY KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING? HAVE WE GOT THE FIGURES RIGHT? BUT WE PUT THEM ON, AND IT'S NAILED IT. I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK WE'VE TAKEN AWAY FROM THE LANCIA FEEL. IN FACT, TO ME, IT FEELS VERY MUCH LIKE A LANCIA FROM THE INSIDE, BUT EVERYTHING IS SMOOTHER. I MEAN, THE POWER DELIVERY IS INSTANT AND SMOOTH, AND NOW THE HANDLING IS JUST NICE AND PREDICTABLE, AND YOU CAN POINT IT INTO A CORNER AND ACCELERATE OUT. I THINK WE'VE NOT ONLY PRESERVED THE LANCIA'S HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS, BUT JUST BUILT UPON THEM AND IMPROVED THEM A LITTLE BIT. IT'S THE MIDDLE OF WINTER, AND I'VE BEEN DOING SOME RANGE TESTING IT SO FAR WITH THE HEATER ON, EVERYTHING ON. I THINK WE'VE GOT ABOUT 115-MILE RANGE, AND THAT'S JUST DRIVING NORMALLY IN QUITE HILLY CONDITIONS HERE IN WALES. WITH 120, 125-MILE RANGE, I THINK IT'S ABOUT BANG ON. POWER STEERING IS GREAT. WATCH OUT FOR THE SHEEP! POWER STEERING IS FANTASTIC. I MEAN, IT FEELS LIKE A MODERN CAR. I'D PROBABLY SAY IT'S EVEN BETTER TO DRIVE THAN IT IS TO LOOK AT. I LOVE IT. I'M NOT READY TO HAND IT OVER TO JERRY. I'VE GOT ABOUT 65 PERCENT LEFT IN THE BATTERY, A LOAD OF, LIKE, REALLY QUIET MOUNTAIN ROADS IN WALES. LET'S EMPTY THE BATTERY FIRST, AND THEN I'LL GIVE IT BACK TO THE CUSTOMER. NOW THAT MOGGY HAS FINALLY RETURNED FROM HIS EXTENDED TEST DRIVE, CLIENT JERRY HAS ARRIVED TO COLLECT THE CAR. - YEAH, IT'S GREAT. - YOU READY FOR TODAY? I'M READY. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR A WHILE. YEAH, WELL, SHE'S ALL WAITING FOR YOU BEHIND THESE DOORS. - OH, GREAT. - YOU READY? - LET'S DO IT. - LET'S RAISE THE SHUTTERS. TA-DA. TA-DA. NOW... WHAT A SIGHT. WE'VE LEFT IT WITH THE BONNET UP BECAUSE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS, THERE'S NO ENGINE IN THERE ANYMORE. KIND OF LOOK DOWN THERE. YOU CAN JUST SEE THE BACK OF THE MOTOR. AH, YES. SO THE MOTOR'S UNDERNEATH THERE MATED TO THE GEARBOX. THEN THIS IS THE BATTERY BOX, SO IT SITS EITHER SIDE OF THE MOTOR. WE'VE GOT THE ELECTRIC POWER-STEERING SYSTEM THAT YOU ASKED FOR ALL INSTALLED, WHICH IS... LOVE IT, YES. ...VERY NICE, AND THEN WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE UNDER THERE, BUT THE FRONT LEAF SPRING AND THE REAR LEAF SPRINGS WE'VE CHANGED TO DEAL WITH THE NEW WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION. OKAY. SO HANDLING NOW IS ABSOLUTELY SUPERB. AND THEN IF YOU HAVE A LOOK INSIDE, I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THIS. HERE YOU GO. BEAUTIFUL. SO IF YOU LOOK OVER JUST TO THE RIGHT OF WHERE THE RADIO IS, THERE'S THE NEW BATTERY-STATE INDICATOR. I MEAN, THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE. LOVELY.YOU READY FOR YOUR FIRST DRIVE? LET'S SIT. OKAY. LET'S... IF YOU JUMP IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, I'M GOING TO JUST PUT THE BONNET DOWN, AND WE'LL TAKE IT FOR A SPIN. OH, HERE WE GO. -TA-DA. MAGIC... SEE, HOPEFULLY YOU'LL FEEL MUCH DIFFERENT IN THE POWER-STEERING DEPARTMENT, MUCH LIGHTER. YEAH, LOVELY... AND THEN JUST, I SAID, THE WEIRD THING IS, YOU WON'T NEED TO CHANGE GEAR, JUST CAN JUST -- SORT OF INSTANT TORQUE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? YEAH, GREAT. LOVELY, SMOOTH POWER, YEAH. NICE AND SMOOTH? NICE AND RESPONSIVE? YES, LOVELY. HEAR THAT? NIPPY. YEAH. THAT'S -- KEEP ON CHANGING GEAR, THOUGH. I KNOW. THAT'S OLD HABITS TO BREAK. SO THERE YOU GO, YOUR NEW ELECTRIC LANCIA FULVIA. YOU HAPPY? YES, SIR. YEAH. GREAT JOB. SO HERE WE ARE, BACK WHERE WE STARTED. LOVELY. WELL, THAT WAS AN EXPERIENCE. - YEAH? - YES. WELL, I AM VERY PLEASED YOU LIKE HER. THERE I GO. LOOK. I'M CHANGING THE CLUTCH AGAIN. HUH? COME HERE. PUT YOUR HAND. STOP USING THE CLUTCH. JERRY, SHE'S ALL YOURS. PEDRO, LOVELY JOB. I WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THIS LANCIA IN BECAUSE OF ITS RALLYING HISTORY, BUT IT WAS CRITICAL FOR ME TO DO THAT RALLYING HERITAGE JUSTICE, AND I'M REALLY HAPPY THE WAY IT TURNED OUT. I'VE TAKEN IT FOR A SPIN ON THE ROAD. THE BALANCE IS GREAT. THE POWER IS GREAT. JERRY'S HAPPY. I'M HAPPY. IT'S FANTASTIC. I LOVED IT. IT'S JUST SAD TO SEE IT GO.
