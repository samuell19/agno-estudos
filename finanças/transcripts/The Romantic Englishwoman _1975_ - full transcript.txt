The.Romantic.Englishwoman.1975.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC.Eng - Where are we? - In France. In Germany. Good evening, sir. I would like a room with a bathroom overlooking the park. We have a nice simple room in front to the park. Could you register, sir? - What do I have to do? - Surname... First name... Perd n, d nde? - The name here, please. - Good morning. - Good morning. She is convinced that, leaving, it will find itself, Do you understand? - Yes, like what happens to Elizabeth. - By the way, where's Elizabeth? In Baden. - Thank you. - You say? What? Yes, the story of my movie. My movie ... So this woman, Caroline, buy a plane ticket to discover herself ... Rome, Paris ... it does not matter to her nor to me. I can shoot anywhere. It's a psychological story about a new woman, do you understand? Yes, I think it's an idea very boring. Very boring. It's pretentious and absurd. But above all, boring. Why do not you make it in a thriller? Wonderful. Perfect. I leave it to you. I'm sorry, Herman, I'm starting a novel. Anyway, I can not work. I want to see Elizabeth. I also want to see it. As soon as I finish with the bathroom, he will invite her to eat. I will tell you. It's not in the bathroom, Herman. It's in Baden Baden. - To the bathrooms? - He has not gone for the bathrooms, he's gone for ... I do not know. There is no man, You know Elizabeth. Anyway, that It's full of Germans. Forgives... I'm sorry, Herman. Champagne, sir? Health. S? Lewis? I was in the Casino. What time is it? Here are also the two. No, no, in the hall. My white evening dress, y t? And the glasses? How is David? Do you miss me? No, I'm not worried, not in that sense. It's not life, Lewis, Is not that so? It is what I want to say. Look, the elevator is here. Not now, Lewis. Adi s. I think ... that it will be better You go to bed, Catherine. Yes, Mr. Fielding. Third, please. - I was on the road, remember? - You are everywhere. - Really ... I'm a poet. - Oh ... a very hard life, is not it? It is not easy, Those women are difficult. If they were not so difficult, Maybe they would not have to pay. Do you like my suit? - This is not the third floor. No, it's the last floor. Well, I want to go down. I think he has been wrong. Yes, I'm sorry. I am terrible for the numbers. There's another elevator there. Where did you come to Baden Baden? I came by the waters. - Say? - Elizabeth, where were you? Lewis? What is happening? Nothing. You seemed strange. You still seem strange. Where were you? - In the bathroom. - I'm calling half an hour ago. I fell asleep in the bathtub. - Elizabeth ... - I'm going home, Lewis. Morning. Stop crying and du rmete. Du rmete That's. Close your eyes, close your eyes. So, good boy. It's fine, nothing's wrong. Thank you. - Do you have anything German? - Alem n? - Made in Germany, a toy. - No, I don't think so. Japan. Have, close. - Thank you. - Adi s. Hello! Mommy! Where is my gift? - T and your gifts ... Don't you kiss me? Well, here you have your gift. A stronger kiss. Other. Catherine? Where is Mr. Fielding? - Oh, Lewis ... But what are you doing there? - I wanted to surprise you. I do not like surprises. Asked the schedule of Baden trains and this was the only possible boat. You never travel by plane. You're the one who never lets me fly. I'm sorry, do not get mad. I have told you, I do not like you to fly. It's wonderful, Lewis. The plane goes very, very fast on the ground and suddenly ... and this is the most amazing part, it rises and floats ... and they bring you a kind of food curious on a tray. What happened to you, Elizabeth? Hello, Elizabeth. I'm a real failure! You're a maric n, you go to the coast when I go back home. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Beautiful night. - Lovely. How does the garden go? - Not bad, I think phosphates are good. Good evening, Mrs. Fielding. - Goodnight. The fruit trees were a disappointment, but we will persevere. Yes. - Frost will kill the flea. - Yes. What is he doing now, writing a new book? I'm afraid I don't read much lately. - No, a movie script. The truth is that I do not go to the movies much. Well, good night. Goodnight. - What happens? - Nothing. I left a thing up. - Do not delay. - Esp rame. Hi, how are you? Come in, come in Hello Isabel. Hello dear, you do not want to tell me what he did in Baden Baden. - Me neither. - I did not do anything. You see? If she told you, it would be a confession I'm just looking for gossip. I had forgotten, That is your thing. I never told James what I did when I went to Ibiza Yes, you did, you told everyone. Even who did not want to know. Many thanks. You are welcome. At least James and I don't think that the fate of women is to stay at home and wash their husband's underpants. You know, Isabel, you really are a very heavy woman, you are probably the woman heaviest in the world. That is your true destiny, the heaviness. - Of course, women are a busy country. - He's right. S that is right But it is very heavy! It's downright unbearable to use vulgar ideas, that nobody with common sense would argue and make them swallow people as if they were a bright pattern in the history of human thought! It's more! For the only thing you can do is to wash someone's dirty underpants! Although you would never admit to loving anyone enough to do it. Lewis! You're a fucking pig! I'm sorry, Elizabeth, I'd better go. That's it, go to the horn with your newspaper! What are you doing there, besides? Remove the dirty people's rags and give the shit to the public! You do not realize that you practically have been accused of having an affair in Baden! How do you dare to come here to impose yourself your own levels of fidelity?! How do you dare?! - Why don't we invite some friends? - How? Isabel? I don't know ... Ted and Marigold, Freddy and Lulu, Stewart and Jonathan. Always the same history, the people we already know. Well, we can invite people that we don't know. What do you think? - It's fine. - If you don't want to, we don't. - What else? What else? Invite everyone, to all you want. We will have a party, boring and new account. - Seriously? - Yes. Then, I will invite you. Not too soon. Are you okay? Tired You seem ... ...disgusted. How is the book going? I left it for now. I'm doing a script for Herman. - That's fine, do not you think? It is about a woman who is going to France or Germany to find herself. - France or Germany ... - Herman doesn't know yet with whom he'll produce it. - How do you find yourself? - She gets on a train, and there she is. I'm trying to convert it in a thriller. It's about ... ...discontent. Elizabeth ... Are you unhappy? I could be, but I feel I have no right. Herman says Baden Baden is interesting, different. Was it like that? - Different from what? From Weybridge? I could be, but I feel I have no right ... Dammit, Will you give me a percentage? - I already gave you half, what more do you want? - Nothing, of course. What is it about? It is an ungrateful woman, who is married to a man charming, bright and full. She thinks he stops her from being herself and feels imprisoned in a straitjacket Whenever she is in the bathrooms, she is enjoying the waters and finding herself. But one morning she gets up and finds herself plunged in despair. But the husband comes and saves her, and then she realizes that he still is a really wonderful guy. - Does he play cricket for England? - I still can't think of him ... Don't. Maybe I'm the one you think I am. What else can I ask for? David is healthy, your books are sold, our checking account is pretty healthy, the roof has no leaks, the house is painted, the fridge is always full and there are fruits and sweets on the sideboard. I have 28 pairs of shoes in my wardrobe, 11 evening dresses and I don't wear panties. I haven't been on buses since 1959 I have an account in Harrods and a regular order to Oxham. So, what else can I ask for? They invited us to dinner, like old times. Who is Thomas Hursa? I have never heard of him. Letter from Paris, He says he met you. Paris? No, he says he met you in Baden Baden. - What did you say his name is? - Thomas Hursa. Oh, yes. We met ... In an elevator. - In an elevator? - Yes, in an elevator. It seems that he is an admirer of you. An admirer? What ridicule! No, a mere admirer. Of my work. He likes my novels. Expecting to come to England. How is he? - Young. And poetic. - Was it the night I telephoned you? - It was what? You said, "The elevator is here." Was that when you met him? That's. - Tell me about him. - Why? - I want to include him in my novel. - Oh, blessed God ... - Did he teach you his poetry? - In the elevator? - How do you know he's a poet? - Because he told me. To what floor is ... By the way, I'm a poet? I called your room. I was in the bathroom. In my version, they will make love. In the elevator. How did you guess? I know your mind - You don't, do you? - Yes, of course. Coming out. Thank you, sir It has been a surprise. - Mr. Field ... Years ago, we didn't see him. - Years ago nobody saw me. And if ...? - What if? - And if anything. Do you understand? It is enough with a moment of doubt about the world we live in Sites like this ... - Don't you think? - What do you mean? What do I want to say? This dinner will cost Herman the nice sum of 150 pounds. How long it takes you to earn ... 150 pounds? My grandfather... He cleaned chimneys for 4 pence weekly and a bowl of soup. You understand me ... And if ...? What is Miranda doing? - I? - You're calling Miranda, right? Yes. She is a professor of comparative theology, at the Sorbonne. - Philosophy. - Sorry. Don't serve him anymore. And if ...? The realm of possibility It's a terrible country. And if such and such were the case? And if the person you love is a liar? Have you ever wondered that? - Don't. A sensible girl. You say that this will not happen to me. That's because of your philosophical preparation. But others aren't so lucky. Hypochondriacs, paranoids, novelists What they say will happen to me. The truth can hit me on the face one day and so it will be the end of my precarious existence. The tiles will break on the roof, the paint on the windows will fall, the grass will narrow and the fruits will rot in the fruit bowl. Sometimes I have something of a poet. You are a novelist, an imaginator of fictions. Can I ask you a personal question? How much money do you earn per night? - Do you play this game? - What game? Well, see, soon ... I'm going to make love to you. Oh, yes? Ver s ... now there is a possibility impossible to avoid. What is it? The game is this. Soon, I'll take you through the track through the service door, against a wall, in a dark corner, between trays of dirty dishes and stacks of tablecloths ... ...happen. Impossible to refuse. - I refuse. You can't deny the future. You should know it is in your occupation, the philosophy. - Oh sure. - Yes, exactly. And then? I told you, it's a game. At "La Sorbonne" we do things otherwise. - Know Baden, Baden Baden? - Lost? Do you know Baden Baden? No? I feel terribly wrong. - I'm not surprised. - Sorry. Lewis ... Lewis doesn't ... Don't... I will discover it, you know ... Bad, will do to you! How much is it? Three with fifty. - Do you know Thomas, the poet? - Dylan Thomas? Don't. Your friend, Hursa. - He is not my friend. Well, it's the same. He is in England. - How do you know? - Phone me. - Ah, yes? - I invited him to drink tea. - What have you done? - I thought it was the right thing to do. - Have you invited him today? - Yes, why not? You are the most twisted, vicious, dirty ... - I had no idea what you would be bothered. - You've done it just to prove me. I know how your brain works. I read your damn mind. - That's just a story. - Well, I'll not be there, I don't want to see him. It's a suspicious reaction if you have seen him only in an elevator. It's my reaction not to join your torturous games. Anyway, I don't think he's coming, He told me he couldn't. What? He comes in step, to meet your editor, I imagine. So I telephoned, as I promised, he would do, in the letter from Paris. - You're lying. - Do not. He hasn't phoned anything. All is a lie. Absolutely. Anything smarter? David, go find the ball. That's why I have to leave. I thought ... if I could get away from everyone, even from the son that I love, I would start to care for myself, and to know myself as I really am. We women are busy species. I know you will understand ... because you ... are a poet. Shit! Hello? With Mrs. Fielding, please. Yes, Mrs. Fielding ... Hi. - Lewis! - S? - You will not come down? - Why? - For tea. - The tea? You have been invited Thomas to have tea. Oh, yes ... Well, he didn't say, he would come. - He said he would try, wouldn't he? - Yes. Yes, he said he would try. Well, then I will. I have everything ready. Well ... it's fine. - What time did you tell him? - At four. He comes late. - Maybe he's not coming anymore. - It's only four and ten. How will he come, by bus, by taxi? - I don't know. Look, this is ridiculous. I'm sorry to have you prepared for all this, but when I invited him, he practically said that ... Ah ... Ah! You can bring him tea  while I do the tea? Thomas Hursa. I hope nothing is wrong, I came from the station. - Nice house. - Yes. I burned my fingers ...! Take everything, huh? Pleased to see you again. Mr. Hursa and I were in the same hotel in Baden Baden. We met in the elevator. I had no idea that he was an admirer of my husband's books. Have you read it in English? - No, unfortunately only in German. My books haven't been translated to German. He must know, Lewis. Milk? - No thanks. - Sugar? - Don't. Lemon? - Do you have brandy? - Of course. Brandy, Lewis. Tell me, Mr. Hursa, what do you like more in my husband's books? - The coincidence. - Coincidence? Yes. Life is full of wonderful and extraordinary coincidences. Sometimes the fiction sounds false because the novelists think that the coincidence It is a failure of art. Is that really interesting, Lewis? - Telefone from the station? - Yes. - Soda? - Don't. Baden Baden, Who goes there at this time? - People in search of health. - Women? - Yes, many. - Rich women. Yes, rich. - Boring wives looking for a cure. - Yes. Are the waters beneficial? For some things. For others there are things ... other cures. - Boring women. - Boring women, divorced, widows. - And what is the cure? - A safe adventure. Oh, yes. But the site should attract a certain type of young people of easy disposition, tolerable appearance and short of money. Do you know then? And they ... give them, to those young people ... money? With the maximum touch. Except the American ones. "Here, take some shirts." English women, they are the most romantic. These women are unhappy, What's so funny about that? They are not even half pathetic or despicable that those gigolos wandering around the hotels and stinking of Italian lotions. I consider that they have much more dignity. Pathetic, I agree. And condemnable. - On the other hand, you are a poet. - Yes. Do you live by the poems? I'm often invited to take tea and things like that. But of course, sometimes it's necessary to be bold. For example, what are your plans? For dinner tonight? Apart from you, nothing very good. Well, in that case it would be better if you stay. It doesn't seem like a little selfish from your site to leave the responsibility of taking care of you to others? It isn't responsibility, but selection. Normally people are kind usually. What wonderful meat. Do you cook? Don't you think that this is taking advantages? Oh, yes, yes. I think. On the other hand... On the other hand? - It takes a little weight off from them. - Weight? Pressure. What do you mean? What does it say? It means that the owners are under the pressure of their property. The rope that holds everything, houses, jobs, women. Isn't that so? - Yes. - Crazy, sure, sir? Yes. Because all the time we are closing doors, connecting alarms and watching those we love. They steal our own life, The meaning of life. - Yes, but you don't live like that. - No, I live with the weight of possession. Possession of what? I wish, love. - Do you smoke these? - Yes, smoke a cigar. "Bourgeois" life has your compensations, right? What would we do without them? Well, if you don't mind, I'll leave you. I'm sure Thomas is looking forward to talk about your books. You forgive me, don't you? Please, don't hurry, there are buses up to midnight or Lewis can call a taxi. Thank you very much for coming to see us. More than nice, lovely. Good evening, Mrs. Fielding. By the way, which of my husband's books you like more? Tom Jones. Of course I read it in German. Well, you will have a lot to talk about Good evening, honey. The joke is over. Thanks for coming to see us. What the hell are you playing at, Lewis? I don't want to see him in this house. - That's not very hospitable. - I don't want to be hospitable to him. Why are you interested? Because the world is like your house, It has a stone face. You mean it is a parse. He is a poet. He believes that poets and people like that don't have to pay. What are the guests of honor in the world. - Maybe we all should be poets. - Yes. - What are you doing here? - That's what I wonder. Since I'm not the author of all the works of Henry Fielding, What did he bring you here? Anyway, if I'm going to include you in my script I have to find out what you are looking for. Come here! Hmm ... I'm hungry. By the way, what is this? And all the time They have robbed your life from you. - I've been looking for that for a week. - I was in a rosebush. - Jerez? - Yes. It's a good sherry. Out of curiosity, Do you ever say "thank you"? I am very grateful, thank you very much. You're very generous. Very friendly. I'm indebted forever to you. That kind of thing? Yes. I have to be grateful Why because you do have all these? It is you who should being thankful. But of course, I will say it if you want. I think it'll be very boring. On the other hand, we wouldn't be offended if I did something in compensation. Can you write to a machine? - A little. All right. You can be my secretary. - Will I receive a salary? - It's just some letters. My work is typing for an agency. It's fine, five pounds a week for expenses. - Will I have an electric machine? - Don't. - Can I use your car? - No. It's a job, not a vacation. I know you have come to pass for free vacation. Unless you came here to discuss my work. Damn Tom Jones ... - Oh, I'm terrible with the names. - Actually you have impudence. - I've been reading this. - Ah, s? Extraordinarily good. I love it. The woman's character ... is awesome. I think you have a lot of perception. Really? Good thank you. Very friendly. "Before our son was born, We were free. My husband is a writer, so we could go anywhere. We made the most wonderful trips. Rome, Paris, New York, California. Of course, I know your work but only through translations. I would love to hear one of his poems. - I'd love to hear your poems. - But he does not understand German. - Are they love poems? - Don't. Maybe those poems don't exist. Maybe you aren't absolutely a poet. In my passport is written that I am. I'm used to skepticism. That could establish borders. - What are you doing? - They're just invitation letters. Oh, that damn party. Well, there's plenty of time for that. By the way, I'd prefer if you didn't ask from Catherine to serve the drinks, She is here to take care of David. - I didn't ask him. But of course, I'll not ask. The little one woke up the anger of his father with his babbling, so he put it on fire and reduced it to fried potato. - And what else?, follow. - The mother said: Oh wait a little, this is exaggerated. - What does it mean? - It's English humor. Ah ... And this is another one. Poor dude Joe, he's gone, you know? To rest to the stars. I miss you so much, so much less. I had such good cigars ... Hello... What do they do? Ah, I'm reading you beautiful poems. Can I stay? Of course. Why do you always say that? Because I wouldn't like to stay if you don't love me. David! David! Until you have a son of his own no account is given to what it means The responsability to keep him alive. David is healthy. It's not just the disease, are the electrical outlets, the fire, the water, the scissors ... One day you decide that you are older to sit alone in the bathtub while you go for a towel. Another day is greater to use the scissors. Then it's the bicycle, from which you can fall and break your head. And if that doesn't happen, he will become old enough to go to the corner to throw a letter. And to go from risk to risk, and live until death. Before he was born, I was ... more free. The lovely children they're the worst. They have you always chained. If they were not so lovely ... one would be free. Clean sheets. - I thought about going to the movies. - All right. I have invited Catherine. I hope it's fine. Yes, why not? Have free afternoons and we are not going to leave. I'm sorry to have to ask, but he hasn't given me my salary. Oh, yes ... of course. Excuse me Have this for now, I'll go to the bank in the morning. Thanks, very kind, very friendly, very friendly. I'm really grateful to you. Goodnight. - Will you not tell me what you're paying? - He's my secretary. - How much? - Five, for your expenses. Well, this is the last straw, isn't it? Get into this house with lies, you eat your food, you drink your brandy, the child is thrown, Copy three letters and charge! He's not pulling it, is he? - How will I know? - He's taken her to the movies. You have sex in your head. - You have it. I want him to leave. - Well, then, tell him. - You invited him, you tell him. I'm not sure of wanting him to go away. Why not? What is this, What are you paying for? He is quite efficient. Yes? Well, if he's charging 5 damn pounds per week You'll have to help me too! Help you with what? With the purchases! Sometimes, when I return home, I hope to see ambulances and trucks of firemen and police cars. My life is too comfortable. Yes, he's lucky. But once I fled, to Baden Baden. I'm ashamed of it. Leave Lewis and David. - It's not such a terrible thing. The obligations to David and Lewis are things that have been imposed in you. We cann't all run away from our responsibilities. - Responsibilities? - Yes, responsibilities. I'm not against you. I also fled. Do you have responsibilities? Not quite. You are the love of my life. Go Catherine, don't worry. Sorry Sorry... sorry. It's fine, Catherine. How many times have I told you not to be like the poster on the windows? You don't laugh when I challenge you! What you did is very wrong! A very bad thing! - Avril. - April. - Aout. - August Do you know what you've done? Do you realize what you have done? He will kill you possibly, stupid slut! And you... A guest in my house! Come, let's get out of here! Excuse me, honey. - Other scoop? No? - Aren't you going to the movies tonight? I can't, I gave him all my money for Catherine. It's free, that's good for you. And then there is a party. - Weren't  we going? We don't have a girl. - I'll stay with David. - Yes, yes. I don't want to go. You would like it. Good... then you two go. I'm sick of foreign movies, and you? Yes. There are too many American movies - Maybe this hasn't been a good idea. - Maybe the party is better. No if it's like the usual ones, always the same faces. Do you really want to go? - Do you want to go home? - Don't. I don't want to get back. I'm hungry. - Looks great. - Danke sch n. - Mrs. Field, what a pleasure! - Fielding, Luigi. I mean, Enrico. - Do you want an appetizer? - Why not? Why not? - What would you like? - What are you going to take? - Vodka with technique without ice, please. - Two. - The letter. - Thank you. I'm sorry, but it's the only place where can I sign? It is nice. Thank you. - Come on, why don't you dance? - I used to do it for living. Then you must do it very well. I can't believe it... Elizabeth Fielding with a man that is not her husband! Isabel! - Where is Lewis? - With the child. I love it. - This is Thomas. - Lovely. Who are you? He is a poet. Incredible! Well, you look very pretty to be "A poet". Is that all he does? I have a distribution businesses, and sometimes I involve myself. - And sometimes it does not deliver. - Sorry, this is George. We met in a gambling house. Work in exports or in imports. I think he's a kind of gangster. - Oh ... How is it? A friend of mine is looking for you. I forgot the old friends. I've heard that. - Do they know each other from before? - I've known Thomas since he was a delivery boy. - I want to dance. - I think your poet is adorable. You care that they thought that you are my lover? She doesn't think that, He knows that I'm not. Your friends know you. If I were your lover, you wouldn't have allowed to be seen here. That's done in the car, in hotel rooms. I'm prudent. You make small jumps in the dark and you do as if nothing had happened. - If I were free ... - We are all free. But I have obligations, I have a son. You have a son, yes. And a husband and a house and this and that. - That's insulting. - I have no interest in insulting you. Because now you don't have interest for me? Because I have to go. What do you mean? I have to leave my house, from England. Why? It's time for me to go. Lewis is already fed up. - When? - Right away. - I think it will be better. - Ma ana? Tonight. - But why? - Let's go. My coat Your coat, sir? - Your coat, sir? - I don't have. I'm not asking you if you love me. It is a disgrace. I know you never pay for anything. But this time... I'll do it. I will pay. My poet... Ahead. A guy came, he told me that will not bother you I was asking about Thomas. I told him that he had left, that we didn't know where. Did I do well? - I guess I know, who was it? He didn't look like that he was a poet. I think you'll never know who has been Sleeping in your guest room. He was nobody No one? With a suit by Yves St. Laurent? Have you ever checked your suitcase? Don't be ridiculous. - You must have some money. - No, nothing. - Actions, bonuses? - Lewis did everything. - Hey, then? - I have some, but I haven't brought them. You are crazy! You are a crazy woman. What do you think we're going to live on? - What you've always lived, I suppose. I have always lived alone. Lewis? - Hello! - Hello. Do you want to drink something? Do not you think it's boring? His whisky? Yes. - Do you have any idea where they are? - Don't. A friend of mine says that he ... They look for certain people. - To Thomas? Why? - To kill them, I think. Why not? For those certain people! Really? Kill him? It is likely to be an adjustment of accounts. And how are you? Well, a little alone at night when I go to sleep. It is really horrible. I can't work. I have to put the things in their place before I can do something. Each thing in its place. I know what you think I deserve it. She will come back and nothing ever have happened. This is probably for the best. Elizabeth doesn't have what it is needed to be free the way she wants. What makes you think that I would come back? For Elizabeth, Thomas is freedom and that makes him sexy. People give too much importance to sex. And it is something that isn't worth for leaving your house. - Money, money, money! - You're crazy. On this site they will not last three days, And then what? We can always get money! Do you know why I love you? For two things. You are a damn poet. And a poopy kid. - Here you are. - Thank you. - I found a place for you. - A hotel? A room. - Are you going to see me there? - Of course, if you want. It will not make you happy. Why don't we make another delivery like the Rolls?, it was fine. It's risky. It is becoming more and more risky. - Go back to your home. - Don't. Lewis will find you. When they asked me, I told them I was a poet. I liked that. It was elegant. Those romantic ladies ... I pleased them, but they didn't take anything from me. I'm not one of them, Right? The English woman was the most romantic. But I wanted you to give me everything. - How long will he be here? - Only two or three days. - Do you live in New York? - Yes, in Place Sutton. - Sutton Place? - Yes. Do you know it? - It is very expensive. - That's not a problem for me ... Who the hell are you? What is he doing? - I'm following him. - Why? I'm not looking to hurt you. - You want Hursa. - Yes. - That's your business. - Yes. - I do not know anything about him. - Don't. I don't want to be responsible for the death of nobody. Death? Oh no. Mr. Hursa has won the lottery of Ireland. And as Minister of Sports of the Irish Republic, I have been in charge of searching for Mr. Hursa and communicate him for his good luck. If he continues to follow me, I'll go right to Calais. So simple. I respect your feelings, of course. Well, it will be again. - I don't understand anything. - It's fine. Mr. Swan and I, we have business together. Have you brought your ... bag? Very good boy I met him for my wife. - What business do you have, Mr. Swan? - Money. Ah inside? Unfortunately, no. - He has followed me here. - I imagined. What should I do? Search for another secretary. - Why did you come? - I came to take you home. Why? - I love you - Why do you love me? He telephoned me and he told me where to come. I do not want you to feel forced to return. Don't. AlexN
