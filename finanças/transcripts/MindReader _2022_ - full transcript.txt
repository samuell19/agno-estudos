- On behalf of our entire team, I'd like to thank you all for coming to our variety show tonight. For our final act this evening I'd like to try something that I hope you'll find interesting. You know, a lot of people ask me if Dexter is a stage name, and I always tell them Dexter is a name you change from, not to. Now, I have in my hand this little lightweight ball. Now I'm gonna turn my back and I'm gonna throw the ball at random to the audience like this. Would someone please catch it? - Here! - I will assume someone now has the ball. Would that person please stand up and throw the ball to someone else, someone you do not know, preferably in the center section of the audience, and that person must catch it. - Here! - Okay, I'll assume someone else now has the ball. Would that person please stand up and throw the ball to someone on this side of the theater totally at random? And that person, please catch it. - Here! - Okay, would the three people who caught the ball please remain standing? Now, I see my trusty assistant Caleb here has already begun giving each of you a marker and a blank pad. These are normal everyday writing pads, so please check the pads when you get them. Make sure there are no mirrors or trap doors hidden in them. Okay, great. Now I want you all to write down a number from one to 100. Don't show it to anyone, just write down a number from one to 100 and then hold the pad close to you when you've done this. Has everyone got their number? Okay, great. Now I want you to think of your number. You're thinking of it? Okay, from this side, 83, 41 and 17. Please show us your pads. 83, 41 and 17. I believe I got them. Thank you. Thank you. Now I'd like to try one more experiment. I want you all to write down a word. Any word that comes to mind, just write it on the pads. Just write down a word. I see everyone writing, so that's a good sign. Has everyone got their word? Okay. You first, ma'am. Have we ever met? - Never. - And your name is? - Mary. - Hello, Mary. Could you please think of your word? You're thinking of it? - Yes. - Your word is kiss. - Yes, that's right. - I hate to disappoint you, Mary, but I don't kiss audience members. Oh, I see. You'd like your date to give you a kiss. You do realize, sir, you're dating a married woman? Now sir, you in the middle. Your first name is? - Lawrence. - Have we ever met? - No, we have not. - Could you think of your word? You thinking of it? - I am. - Your word is boy. - That's right. - Are you married, Lawrence? - Yes, I am. - And your wife's pregnant? - Yes, she is. - And you have kids. - Two lovely girls. - And you'd like to have a boy. - Yes, I would. My girls don't like throwing the football around. - And you will have a son. Now miss, your turn. Your name is? - Cindy. - Hi, Cindy. Have we ever met? - No, we have not. - You thinking of your word? - Yes. - Your word is flowers. - That's right. - Thank you. Do you like flowers, Cindy? - Yes, I do. I hope to open a flower shop. - You should try again. You have been a terrific audience. My name is Dexter and I don't really do magic. I just read minds. Goodnight. - All right, what are your thoughts? - Thoughts on what? - How'd he do it? - Oh, come on, he uses plants. - We've seen the show six times now. It's different people every night. - Well, then he uses multiple plants. - It's not it. It's a very random draw with the ball. You saw him do it. - Oh, I don't buy it. - Which in other words means you don't know how he did it. - There are a number of ways he could've done it. Am I sure of which one he used? No, but he picked one. - I've seen him do this with 18 people. There's no one tipping him off. I mean, the more I think about it, this could be the best thing I've ever seen in magic. - Good night, Nicholas. I'll see you at the office tomorrow. - You'll be back to see it again. - Dexter, uh, someone's here to see you. - Sure. - How did you know that? - Hello, Mary. - How did you know I was married? Do you always go around making bad jokes like that? - Bad jokes? - How did you know I was married? - Mary, he's a mind reader. - Don't give me that. We have never met before. That man just left me because of you, and we were doing really well. Plus, he had money. Thanks a lot. - I'm really sorry, Mary, but perhaps you should have been upfront about your marriage. - My personal life is none of your business. I should sue you for embarrassing me like that. I wanna know how you knew. Come on. Tell me. - Mary, he's a mind reader. Didn't you read a description of his act? - Well, I think your act stinks. - You think you can get him to attend? - I'm going to try, but just make sure you record everything that is said. We may not get another chance. - He's mentally all there, right? - He was kind on the phone and sounded fine. He did say his health isn't the best, but was willing to let us come see him. - Well, that's good. - The association owes this man. Shall we? My name is Grayson. This is Thomas. It's very nice to meet you in person. - Have a seat, gentlemen. - Thank you for allowing us to come and visit. - Very sorry to hear about the passing of Nicholas. I had great respect for him, especially when he was able to take over the association. - Yes, sir. He was a great leader. And he had the same mutual respect for you, as well. - Sir makes me sound so old. You can call me Caleb. - As I was telling you on the phone, the association wants to honor Dexter with the Thoreau award, and we would be honored if you could be there that night to receive the award on Dexter's behalf. - Well, it's a very nice gesture, but you know it's not our way. - You do understand this is the highest award in our profession that any performer can receive. - And your friend Thomas here, he's part of the association? - Yes, but he's here for the second reason we wanted to meet with you. Thomas? - I'm doing research on Dexter and writing an in-depth article on his act for an exhibit in our museum. I was hoping you could answer a few questions for me. - I don't know. - Thomas is a well-respected journalist, Caleb, a man of integrity in his writing. And this information won't be made available to the public. - That's right. This will only be available in our museum, and it'll be based solely on what you tell us here today. - Mmm-hmm. - You are talking about events that happened many, many years ago, and I don't really have the fondest memories of the association back then. - That leadership team is gone, Caleb. Every member's passed away. Every one. And do you know the president of the association has the utmost respect for Dexter and his ability? Nicholas had told me more than once that Dexter's act was the greatest thing he'd ever seen in magic, and it talked about honoring him in this way for quite some time. We thought it was best to carry out those wishes, especially after his rather sudden passing. - What would you like to know? - As much as you're willing to tell us. We know there have been many wrong and misleading articles written about Dexter. - Yes, many. - So now's your chance to set the record straight. You are the only one who can. The museum will present Dexter in the bright light that he deserves. We promise you that. - And may I record this, please? That way I won't miss a word you say. And as we said, we want this to be based on your words. I hope this is acceptable. - That will be okay. - What was your most treasured memory about Dexter? - That he was a good man who treated everybody with fairness and great respect. Most performers are in this for the fame and fortune. Not Dexter. - Where did you two meet? - We worked together down at the machine shop, and it just so happened that I worked near his station and that's how I met him. - When did you recognize that he had this ability? It was one day at the factory in the break room that I first noticed he had something special. - I'll take one. - One? - Yeah. - Dealer takes two. Your bet. - Five. - I see your five and I'll raise you 20. - You can't raise 20, Jarvis. The most you can raise is 10. - Okay, Pauly, I'll raise you 10. - See your 10 and I'll raise you 10. Look, that's all I got. - Well, that's in then, huh? See what you got. I call. - Two pair. Kings over sixes. - Oh, that's a good hand. Not good enough. Three nines. You lose. - You're so lucky, Jarvis. - I'm just a winner. - No, you're lucky. - Better than being a loser. - Look, I can't afford to lose this money. I won't be able to buy groceries for my family. - That's your problem. - Come on, Jarvis. Show some mercy. You win all the time. - You guys shouldn't be gambling. - Stay outta this, Dexter. - It just causes problems. - Not if you play your cards right, it doesn't. - Come on, somebody lend me some money. - Yeah, so Pauly can lose some more. - Come on, Dexter. Let me borrow some money. - Sorry, Pauly. - Look, I'm good for it. I'll pay you back. I gotta get my money back. I can't afford to lose what I just did. - Like I said, it just causes problems. - Pauly's money always tastes better. - Don't rub it in, Jarvis. - What you gonna do about it? - Jarvis, haven't you done enough? - You know, you should talk a lot for somebody who doesn't even play. Why don't you sit down and play me a hand? - No, I don't gamble. - Probably doesn't know how to, right? You probably never gambled a day in your life. - No, I haven't. But it wouldn't be fair if I did. - What is that supposed to mean? - Just that it wouldn't be fair. - You got that right. I could probably beat you without even lookin' at my cards. - Shuffle the deck, Jarvis. - Huh? - Shuffle the deck. - Ooh-woo! All right. Yeah! Dexter's gonna play. Now we're talkin'. Five card stud, no limit. Hmm, I've been waiting to get into your pockets for a long time there, busta. - Lemme know when you think they're shuffled. - Mmm-hmm. There. They're shuffled. You gonna play or not? Get your money out. Come on. - Pick out a card. - Hmm? - Draw out any card. - Are we gonna play or not? - Just draw out a card. - So? - Guess what it is. - Guess? - Guess it. What is that card? - I don't know. - Just guess. - I don't know. Queen of diamonds. Who cares? - Check the card. - Check the card. - Check it. See if you're right. Take a peek. Just you. - I don't understand. - Not the queen of diamonds, is it? - No. How did you know it's not the queen of diamonds? - Because I know, and you don't wanna play with me. - Why? You think you know what the card is? - Yeah, I do. - Wait. You think you can tell me what this card is without looking at it first? - That's right. - I will bet you all the money on this table that you cannot tell me what this card is. Come on and put your money where your mouth is. - Pauly, how much did you lose? - I don't know. - How much? - 65. - $65 says I know exactly what this card is. Get Pauly his money back. - You got a 1 in 51 chance of guessing what this card is. You're willing to put $65 on it? No way. - My money's on the table. - Willing to take those odds. Here's mine to match it. - Sure you wanna do this? - My money's on the table, isn't it? - Pauly, if I do this, you've gotta promise to stop gambling. Pauly, if I get you your money back that you lost, you gotta promise me you'll stop gambling. - Come on, Dexter. Name the card. - Pauly, do we have a deal? - Okay, okay. I won't gamble. - I won't gamble. - I won't gamble again. - Come on, Dexter. Name the card. What are you doing? - There's my prediction. Check the card first. Not the queen of diamonds. - You think you're right? - Have a look. - It's the four of clubs. - He got it! I can't believe he got it. It's absolutely right. He got it! - How did you know that? - Remember, never again. Get your groceries. - How did you know that? Dexter, how'd you know that? Come back here. How? You know how he did that? - And that was the beginning. When I talked to Dexter about it later, he said he was going to start doing his mentalism act on stage. - And he asked you to join him? - He was looking for somebody that he could trust to be his assistant to work with during his act. - And is this when he started working at the theater? - Yes. - Now, according to Nicholas, Dexter was just one of the acts at first, but after a few shows and when the owner saw Dexter's popularity growing, he asked him if he would be the closing act, which he agreed to do. - That's right. - He even asked you to kind of oversee the entire production. Gave you workspaces right at the theater? - Yes, we set up right there. - And this is the only place he would ever perform. - For the most part, yes. - Seen the show six times now. Each of you have had a chance to see him at least once. And just as I predicted, neither of you can tell me how he does it. - What I can tell you is that it is a boring routine at a two-bit theater. - Well, that boring routine is packing out that two-bit theater every time they're putting on a show. And it's not because of the other acts, I can tell you that much. I know this sounds a bit farfetched, but just consider for a minute, what if Dexter really can read minds? - No one can read minds. - I'm not so sure. - I'm sorry. Nicholas, you think this guy can actually read minds? - Yes, Robert, I'm starting to think that I do. - You're too easy to impress. - All right. Look. There's something I need to disclose to you, something you both should know. - Well, we're listening. - A few months ago when Dexter was starting with the show, my neighbor went to go see him, and he was talking to me about the show the next day. He was raving about what Dexter did, and he asked me how he could have done it. He knows about my affiliation here and we talk about magic from time to time. Of course, I never tell him any secrets. The one thing I assured him was that whatever he saw, it was a trick. It was a trick, and there could be many explanations. As we all know, there's certainly more than one way to do mentalism. However, that, that conversation, it got my curiosity up, so I went to go see the show one night. - With the neighbor? - No, no, no. I went by myself. And I was very discreet, by the way. I sat off to the side. But when Dexter came out to do his effect, that first toss of the ball came to me. - Really? So he did the trick with you? - Yes. - Everyone got their words? Okay, good. And your first name is? - Nicholas. - Have we ever met? - No, we have not. - Okay, good. Think of the word that you've written down. You're thinking of it? - Yes. - Your word is wonder. - Yes, it is. - Thank you. You should contact your father, Nicholas. He'd welcome your call. Now, ma'am, in the middle. Have we ever met? - And then he moved on to the next person. - So, what's the big deal? - How did he know these things? - Maybe your neighbor told him. - No, my neighbor had no idea I was going to the show that night. I never implied that to him or to anyone. I, I, I didn't even tell anyone here at the office. I just went one night by myself. - Sorry, I still don't buy it. - This happened to me, Maxwell. Not to some so-called plant, but to me. He knew the number I wrote down, he knew the word. But for him to know about my father. Now you gents know the situation there. I have not spoken to my father in 10 years. And the thing that really gets me is that when I wrote down the word wonder, I was thinking of my father. So you tell me. How did he know all this? - I don't know, but it's still a trick. - Well, if it is a trick, it is a bloody good trick. I mean, this is flawless. He knows. I, I don't know how he knows, but I believe that he can read minds. - Nicholas, now, you're not making this up? This is how he did the trick with you? - Yes. And you've seen the show yourselves. Now, he does the same thing with each person every night. I am telling you, gents, there is something here like we have never seen before. And I am looking at two of the great historians of magic who probably know the secret to every trick that's ever been done. Except this one. - Hey, girl. - Hey. - I heard you went to the show last weekend and you caught the ball. - Yeah, I did. - How fun. And he got your number right? Guessed your word? - Yeah, he did. My word was flowers and he got it. I have no idea how. - He is amazing. I wanna go again. - He said the strangest thing to me. You know I've applied for that loan to open my flower shop? - Yeah, and you keep getting turned down. - Yeah, three times now. Well, he asked me if I like flowers. I said yes. I said I hope to open my own flower shop. And he said, "You should try one more time." - Try one more time to get a loan? - I think that's what he means. I'd given up on it. - Maybe you should. - Michelle, I don't think I could get rejected again. - He got your word, he got your number. Why not try again? - Maybe I will. - You should. And if you get rejected, we'll both go down to that theater and tell the mind reader it's his fault. - Dexter, I'd like to introduce to you Miss Judy Skyler. She'd like to speak with you. - Hi Dexter. It's so nice to meet you. - Hi, Judy. It's nice to meet you, too. - I'll get right to the point. I was wanting to know if you guys needed any help. I just love what you're doing here and I'd like to get more experience in this field. Now, I was involved in a few plays in college as a stage manager, and it can be part-time, and you don't have to pay me. I wanna work for free. I'm a really quick learner. I can build things, I can paint, I can clean up, whatever is needed. I just think if you give me a chance, I could be a real asset to you. - Well, you certainly seem to be ambitious. Do you have any desire to be a performer? - Performer? No, not me. I really would just like to work backstage. I'm just fascinated with show business and the theater, especially live shows like this. - Well, our act is pretty much set, but perhaps you could help out with the entire show and oversee some of the details of the other acts for us. - Yeah, that sounds great. I'll do anything I can to be of help. And again, you don't have to pay me. I don't need any money for this. - Well, if you're sure that's the way you want it, why don't we try it and see how it goes? How about you come back here this time tomorrow and we'll see if we can find some things for you to do. - Thank you so much. I'll be here. - Okay, Tommy. That's right. Practice is now going to be a three instead of two. Yes, I'm headed to go get the uniforms right now. Okay. See you there, champ. All right now. - Boys are excited about getting their uniforms. - Yeah, you know it. And how's my little ballplayer coming in there? - Your little ballplayer or cheerleader is doing just fine. - Hey, now you know if she's a girl I'll love her just like I love our others. But I got a feeling that this time we're gonna have a boy. - I just don't want you to get your hopes up too much. - Oh, I'm not. But that mind reader told me that we were going to have a boy. - So we're listening to the mind reader now? - Hey, he guessed my number, didn't he? He guessed my word. - And what if he's wrong? - Then I guess he'll need to go back and work on his trick some more. - Nice to meet you, Susan. Have we ever met? - Never. - You thinking of your word? Your word is locket. - Yes, that's right. - Thank you. And don't worry, Susan, you'll find it. Now finally, your turn, miss. Your name is? - Patty. - Nice to meet you, Patty. Please think of your word. Hmm. Are you thinking of your word? - I am. - This is different because it's not really a word, is it, Patty? You just wrote down XOXO. Is that right? - Yes, it is. How did you know that? I thought I had you. - Patty, it's not nice to try to fool the mind reader. You've been a terrific audience. My name is Dexter and I don't really do magic. I just read minds. Goodnight. - I couldn't stop thinking about the show last night. Now, I know you are both skeptical still, but you've got to admit Dexter knowing what Patty wrote down, that was pretty amazing. I mean, she was trying to trick him. She didn't even write down a word, and even still he got it. - Yes, amazing. - How is he doing it? - I really don't care. - Oh, yes you do. You just don't want to admit it. Robert, come on. You at least have to admit what Dexter did last night was impressive. - He doesn't find it impressive, either. - Is your name Robert? - I think we should talk with Dexter, tell him about association membership, its benefits. - I can't see Dexter wanting any part of the association. - Well, I don't think Dexter realizes how much we can help him. - I'd say he's doing quite well without our help. - Or he's afraid we might expose him. - Oh, well that talk right there, that's going to make him real interested in a membership. - Maxwell, we're trying to grow membership, not turn people away. You're in charge of setting up a meeting with Dexter. - What if I can't get him to come see us? - Well, I wouldn't want you to put him out. Why don't you tell him we'd like to visit him, see his workspace. Perhaps when we're there we can figure out how he's doing things. - Okay. I'll see what I can set up. - And I have no idea how he knew my number or my word. It was so amazing. - I wanna go see this show. - Well, get Jerry to take you. - He doesn't like to go to shows like that. - Well, tell him you do. And if he doesn't take you, I'll go again. - You know what? I'm gonna tell him that. - Do you remember how I told you I lost my locket? - The one that was like your great-grandmother's? - Yeah, it's been in the family for generations. - You lost it a long time ago. - It's been months and it still bothers me. But the mind reader's last words to me were, "Don't worry, Susan, you'll find it." I wonder why he said that. - Shows are going well. In fact, they're always packed from what Nicholas said. And people were there for the most part just to see Dexter. - Dexter's act was getting attention. - See, I don't understand why the association was so against him. You would think they would be all for the good press that the art was getting. - They were jealous. They couldn't figure out how he was doing an act that people were raving about. - That's right. - Dexter, Caleb, I'd like to introduce you to these gentlemen from the association. This is Mr. Robert Clark. He's the director. Maxwell Kazak, the treasurer, and Nicholas Brower, who works at their office. - Pleasure, gentlemen. - I'll let you guys visit. Excuse me. - Thanks, Judy. - Well, Dexter, this is quite the act you've put together, and it's causing quite a stir. I understand most of the people coming to see the show are actually coming to see you. - Well that's very kind of you to say, but I think all of the acts are going over well. - Of course. You know, I've seen many mentalism acts and I am familiar with how they're done, but frankly, yours is a bit baffling to us. - So far. - Yes, so far. - I'll take that as a great compliment. - If I may, Dexter, it seems to me you do the same routine every time, though. Ever thought about mixing it up some? - Mixing it up? - Oh, well, you know, adding a little variety to the act. - Why should we? It's going well. - Well, aren't you afraid the audience would tire of the same old thing? - Well, there are many new audience members in each performance and I think the fact that we can do the same old thing each night and still fool the audience is a true test of a good effect, don't you? - Dexter, may I ask, where did you learn to do what you do? Or who did you learn it from? I'm familiar with many of the great mentalists past and present. - I believe this is an original, sir. - So you thought up the effect yourself. You didn't read it in a book. No one taught it to you. - That's all I'd really like to say about it. - And that's okay, Dexter. We understand and respect that you want to protect your craft. I did leave some material with the young lady about our association and the benefits that I'm certain that it can offer you. I just ask that you look it over carefully and seriously consider joining us. - I surely will. - And Maxwell, I think we should invite our two new friends to the event we have scheduled later this month. It's a gathering of many magicians. We're honoring three of our senior performers. Most of our members will be there. I'm sure they would very much enjoy meeting you, Dexter and Caleb. - Yes, please. By all means. The two of you should come. - I'm not sure. It's not really our way. - Well, Caleb's right. It's not the sort of thing we usually participate in, but I think this time we'll make an exception. We'll be happy to attend. - Great. That's good to hear. I'll have my secretary send over the details, and of course you'll both be honored guests that evening. - That's very kind of you. - Well, very nice to meet you. Good luck with the act, and when I think we have it figured out, I'll be the first to let you know. - Again, I'll take that as a great compliment. - Well, so long. - Oh, and Nicholas, have you had a chance to contact your father yet? - No, not, not yet. - Don't be afraid, Nicholas. - I was hoping we could have met him backstage because maybe we could have seen something. - I don't think a man like Dexter would leave his secrets lying around for just anyone to see. - Or maybe there was no secret to see, even if we did get backstage. - Nicholas, no one can read minds. He's doing something. Behind that smile and all that kindness, Dexter's up to something. He's pretty smug if you ask me, like he knows he's got one up on us. - Well, hello there, gentlemen. - Howard, how are you? You a member my associates, Maxwell and Nicholas. - Yes, of course. Thanks for the invite to your event. I plan to be there. - Wonderful. We look forward to that. - And how about that Dexter down at the theater? Isn't he something? - Yes, yes. Dexter is a very entertaining and talented performer. - You know, I've been three times now. We were just talking about it over at our table, and people were saying this man has supernatural powers. - Well, we were just speaking to him at the theater, and you know, he'll be at the event. You can meet him there. - And I assure you, Howard, Dexter does not have supernatural powers. It's just a trick. That's all. - Well, you know how he's doing it? - Well, we have an idea, yes. - Well, we do look forward to seeing you there, Howard. Dexter will definitely be in attendance, and well, you can ask him all of your questions then. - That sounds great. I'll be looking forward to it. - So long, Howard. - You see what's happening here? People are so easily deceived. - That is sort of the idea with what we do, isn't it? - Gentlemen, we need to be more careful. Howard is one of the wealthiest and most influential patrons that we have. We need to keep him interested in our brand of the art. So Maxwell, I would appreciate it if you'd keep your comments to yourself when he's around. - What do you want me to do? Let him believe lies? I mean, you heard him. It's ridiculous. - Oh, yes. Ridiculous. Ridiculous. It is, utterly. Unless of course Dexter really can do this. - Did Dexter know his act was starting to ruffle the association's feathers, so to speak? - Yes, he knew. - It really bothered them that the audience was saying that Dexter had supernatural powers, something that he never claimed. - Never. - You would've thought that they would've been happy for the excitement Dexter was creating and just played down the supernatural part. - I mean, according to Nicholas, Dexter was making the art more popular and people were talking about it. - But perhaps because the talk was all about Dexter, the association thought that he might become bigger than they were. They would become less relevant, especially if Dexter didn't join with them. - And that was something he was never going to do. - Mr. Caleb. - Miss Judy. - Here is a new show order for you all typed up. - Okay. Thanks. - I really think that changing the order is a good thing. So many people are coming back to see it. It'll sort of look different. - Even though it's really not. - Well, tomorrow night's rehearsal will help. Everyone needs to realize they'll be coming onto the stage at different times throughout the course of the evening. - And have fun running that, because we won't be here. - Why not? - We're going to the event at the association. - Oh, that's right. - This looks good. And no mistakes. - Well, I got an A in my high school typing class. Thank you. - Ah, I got a D. - You got a D? - Well, I guess my teacher didn't like my hunt and peck method, you know? Hunt, then peck. Bing! - Hello, Operator? Operator. Hello? Hi, yes. I'd like to make a long distance call, please. To England, yes. Yes, that's right. No, no, no, that's fine. I'll wait. Hello, Operator. I'm, I'm sorry. I thought I wanted to make a call, but I've changed my mind. Sorry to have bothered you. - That is the biggest piece of fuzz I have ever seen on a tie. Wait, I'll make. - For awhile I just got tired of it, so I just threw it away. - In this hand, and you put it down in there like so, then tell me which hand you think the red ball's in. No, that's the black sponge ball, but this is the red sponge square. - That is one fine act you have there, Mr. Dexter. - Very kind of you. - Yes, I've been three times now. - I hope you've been entertained. - Oh, very much so. Between you and I, you wouldn't want to tell me how you do this trick? I'd be willing to offer you something for your secret. - Offer me something? - Yes, I'm pretty well off. How would $5,000 be if you clue me in on how you're doing it? - Well, the guy we spoke to earlier offered us 10. - Well, maybe I better go 15. - Oh, 15 what? - Oh, just a joke we're having. I was telling Dexter here how much I enjoyed his act. - Oh, yes, Dexter. Everyone's been talking about it all night. But listen, speaking of your act, why don't you perform something for us here tonight? You have a captive audience. - Yes, we would love to see you perform something. - And I'm sure everyone else here would feel the same way. - That's very kind of you, gentlemen. But this is neither the time nor the place. - Oh. - Oh. What's the matter, Dexter? Haven't had time to set up the plants? - Plants? You mean Dexter's show uses plants? - Of course it does. How else do you explain how he does it? - I can assure you no one's using any plants. - Dexter, the public may have fallen for your mentalism tricks, but I have not. I know you use plants, so just admit it and we'll keep it our little secret. Howard won't say anything, will you Howard? - No. - Didn't you hear what I said? We don't use plants. - Can't Dexter answer his own questions? - As Caleb said, we don't use plants. - Well, if that's the case, then let's see you pull off your little trick right here, right now then. - I thought we were supposed to be your guests tonight. - No, you are, you are. But if Dexter doesn't use plants, then you should be able to pull off your trick for us tonight, right? - Like he said, this is not the place. Attention. Attention. May have your attention, please? I'm asking the great Dexter here to do his little mentalism act for us tonight, but it seems he can't do it because he doesn't have time to prearrange things and set it up. - Don't you think you're a bit out of line? - No, I don't. You say you don't use plants, and I say you can't do your act without your plants. I'm just simply giving you an opportunity to prove me otherwise. - We don't have to prove anything to you. - Caleb. If you would, please get me two pads. - Okay, so your trusted assistant went and got your little pads, and your captive audience is ready. Who'd you like to do your act with? - Well, how about you? - I was hoping you'd say that. - Stand there, please. I'd like you to think of a word. Any word. Let me know when you have it. - All right, I have it. - Okay. Write your word down on the pad, please, while at the same time always thinking of the word you're writing down. You are still thinking of the word you've written down? - I am. - I am also going to write down a word, and I say they will match. Show us your pad, please, Maxwell. - Strawberry. - That wasn't the word you were thinking of. - Yes it was. Strawberry. - No, that was not the word you were thinking of. - Yes, it was. It was strawberry. I eat them all the time. - That was not the word you were thinking of. - Yes it was. - You're not telling the truth. - You calling me a liar? How about you're a fake? - How am I supposed to do the effect if you don't play by the rules? - You see? The the great Dexter can't do his act without his plants. - Admit it. That wasn't the word you were thinking of. - My word was strawberry. - That was not the word you were thinking of. Tell the truth. - My word was strawberry. - Tell the truth! That was not the word you were thinking of! - My word was strawberry. - I can't do the effect if you don't play by the rules. - And you can't read minds. - Have a good night, gentlemen. - That's it. Run away. You're right, by the way. The word I was thinking of wasn't strawberry. It was fraud! - I didn't think the object of this meeting was to chase them off. - The object of this meeting was to learn how the effect was done, which we just discovered. - And what did we just discover? - That he uses plants like I've been saying all along. - But he said you were thinking of a different word than what you wrote down. - So what? He uses plants and that's that. - Then he was right. You wrote down a different word than what you were thinking. - I don't know. It was so long ago, I can't remember. - This proves nothing. - It proves that he's a fake and he uses plants. - A fraud, hmm? Look what he wrote. - How in the world? Okay, okay. I blew it. I blew it and I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But do you know how many people talked to me about Dexter last night? All of them. And do you know how many of them asked me if I thought Dexter had supernatural powers? All of them. - And what did you say to them? - Well, I took the high road. I gave them your line. I said Dexter is a very entertaining and talented performer. But they kept pressing me over and over again. All of them kept raving about the great Dexter. - And this is what caused your misguided attempt to challenge him. - I was tired of hearing about it. Nobody can read minds. It's impossible. He's doing something. And if this act goes on, he is going to make the association insignificant. - I agree. He's become a problem for us. But we need to be smart about how we solve that problem. - We gotta find out how he's doing this act or find a way to stop him. And for me, preferably both. - Can I get those lights turned on? Thank you. Hey, we're gonna try this new lighting setup. Will you go tell Dexter? - I'll get him. - Thank you. Okay. - Dexter, we're ready for you. - On my way. - He's on his way. - Okay. - Dexter. Okay, so we're gonna try this new lighting setup. Let's just pretend the juggling act is just finished and you've come on stage. - Okay, Caleb. I wanna add another toss at the beginning of the routine. Judy, I've left my ball backstage. Would you mind grabbing it for me? It's on my work table. So I was gonna toss the ball to someone at the back of the audience and then have them throw it to someone several rows in front to make it more random. - Teresa, you're not gonna believe it. I found the locket. - The locket? Where? - In my jewelry box. - But I thought you said you looked there. - I did. It's the first place I checked. And I've checked several times, but I couldn't find it. - But you saw it today. - The only thing I can think is the bottom drawer of that jewelry box sometimes gets jammed shut. I must have shaken it loose this morning and there it was. - So it was there the whole time and you never knew it? - Maybe it was stuck under something? - I'm so happy for you. Something so special like that. - What a relief. - I guess that mind reader guy was right. - Yeah, he was. I did find it. - Hey Cindy, the boss is ready to meet with us. - Okay, comin'. Thanks. - So you found this in the waste basket? - Yes. As I was emptying it I just happened to notice it. - This is how he begins his act. - I know. That's why I kept it. - Pick a number from one to 100. What are all these mathematical equations? - I don't know. Couldn't make anything of it. - Have you seen them doing anything backstage during the show? - No. I'm back there throughout the whole performance and I don't see anything unusual. - Have you seen them talking to audience members before the show? - No. And I watch Caleb especially. He doesn't talk to anybody. - Have you seen them doing anything that can help us figure out how they're doing this? - No, nothing. I'm sorry, sir. - There is this, though. This could be what we need. They're not onto you? - Oh, no. Like you said, don't ask any questions. Just be there and maybe something will fall our way. - Maybe something has. - Hello, Operator? Yes, I'm still here. Yes, I'll hold. Hello? Hello? This is, um. It's, it's me, Dad. It's Nicholas. Yes, it's, it's really me. I know it's about mid-afternoon there for you, so I thought I'd just try and catch you before you go down to the pub. It's good to hear your voice, too. Oh, I'm, I'm, I'm fine. I'm all right. I'm doing quite well, actually. You all right? I missed you, too. - Well, we just want you to be happy. Robert? - Excuse me for a minute. - He says he'll be here. - You spoke to him directly? - Yes, and he says he's coming. - Good, good. Let's invite as many of our members as we possibly can. - Okay. I'll start working on it right away. - And let's arrange them behind Dexter in a semi-circle, really make him feel our presence. - Perfect. - Cindy, I think you have some important mail. - The bank? - The bank. - No, I can't open that. I need you to read it to me. - No, this is yours. - Michelle, I can't. Please just read it. - Are you sure? - Please. - Dear Ms. Fisher, thank you for your interest in First National Bank. Below we have listed the guidelines we use when reviewing applications and determining an applicant's eligibility. Applying. Based on that understanding and the documents you have submitted in support of your application, we hereby inform you that your request for a business loan has been approved. - Approved? - Approved. Congratulations, girl. - The mind reader was right. - Before I say anything else, I want you to know this. I think your act is the finest thing I've ever seen in magic. I mean that. I really believe that somehow you can do this magnificent thing. Honestly, it's the only explanation I have. I've seen the show a dozen times now and I really think you have a very special gift. It's my only conclusion. - That's very kind of you. - That all being said, the association feels quite different. They see you as a threat to them, to their authority, and to their future. According to them, your act is causing a stir that is not good for the art of magic, and this association is strictly against anyone who has a way of producing their illusions or effects, claims to have supernatural powers. - But Dexter's never made such claims. - Well, yes, but you aren't denying them, either. And this presents a problem. - And so the meeting, that's what this is about. - Yes, it is. And I'm sorry to say, but unless you announce publicly that what you're doing is not supernatural, the association is going to do everything in their power to stop you from performing. - But how could they stop our show? - Trust me, they can. And they will. - Maybe we shouldn't go then. - I plan to attend. - Dexter, I'm not sure that, look, I came here to see you because this is serious. This is very serious. There are people out there raving about the great Dexter, a man who can actually read people's minds. That's not a magic trick anymore. It's a miracle. This won't stand, not with them. They aren't going to let this go until you announce, and publicly, that what you are doing is not supernatural. That it is not a miracle, that it isn't real. Even if it is, they want you to say that it's just a trick. - Which would take away from what our act is all about. It is the mystery that sells it. - I know. But they aren't going to let this go. - Thank you for coming, Nicholas. - Just don't underestimate them. The association doesn't play to lose, nor do they plan to. - Attention, please. This meeting will commence. Would the secretary please note the minutes? Dexter, I suppose you know why we asked you here. - Of course he does. He's a mind reader. - Our job as the governing board of magic is to maintain the integrity of our craft. And it is a craft. There's nothing supernatural about what we do here. A magician spends countless hours perfecting their performance, building incredible apparatus to help them create an illusion on stage. There's no room in our art for supernatural powers. - I never said what I do is by any supernatural power. - No, that's true, but your audience believes it, and so far you have not refuted that belief. Now, you have refused membership in the association. That of course is your right. You're not a member. You're not bound by our rules, but we do insist that you make a public announcement that what you do is based on your skill and not supernatural power. - But why must I? - Because we both know there's no such thing as the supernatural. Do you want your audience believing a lie? - Mr. Clark, I've seen a lot of performers over the years, and not once have I ever seen a performer tell his audience during or even after the show that what he or she was doing was just a trick. People are going to believe what they want, and I see no need to say anything. - Because you know it is the mystery around what you do that sells tickets. Isn't that right? - Well, I hardly think it makes sense to perform to an empty theater, do you? - Dexter, do you, um, recognize these notes? - Yes, I do. - It says here, "Pick a number from one to 100." I believe that's the way you begin your act. And that is followed by quite a lengthy list of mathematical equations. Now, we haven't been able to figure out what these mean, but I believe this is evidence that what you do is really some sort of a math trick and has nothing to do with the supernatural. We want you to make a statement publicly to that effect. Otherwise, we will publish these notes and prove once and for all that what you do is simply a trick. - And I have a feeling this is going to hurt ticket sales. - Robert, what are you doing? You, you can't do this. It's unethical. You cannot publish. - This was private property. - This was found in the trash. - Denounce the supernatural, and we will not publish. You have my word. And you have three days to make your decision. - Show's over, Dexter. - Anything more to say, Dexter? Well, you know our terms. I believe that ends this meeting. Please note the minutes. - That paper is meaningless. - Well, of course you're going to say that now. - I planted it so that Judy could find it. You do know who Judy is, don't you, sir? - Judy? - For those of you not in the know, a young woman, Judy, volunteered to work on the show, said she just wanted the experience. Didn't even wanna be paid. And truth is, the association sent Judy so she could try and figure out how we did our effect. Isn't that right, sir? - We have the right to defend the integrity of our craft. - People want to believe, sir. They don't want to think that it's just a trick! - Dexter, will you make a public statement denouncing what you do as being supernatural? Yes or no? - This has nothing to do with me making a public statement. - Will you make a public statement denouncing what you do as being supernatural? Yes or no? - This has nothing to do with me making a public statement. - We will publish these notes! - Why don't you get to the truth of the matter, sir? This has nothing to do with you highlighting the skill of the performer or protecting the integrity of the craft. And this has nothing to do with me making a public statement! The fact is, you and your associates and your years of experience can't figure out how this is done. And that's what you're obsessed with. You can't stand not knowing. And if you do publish this, I'll just tell my audiences what I've told you, that I allowed your plant, Judy, to find it to fool you. So go ahead, publish it. 'Cause I've got a feeling the move will just generate more interest in my show, drive up ticket sales, more people entertained, more people believing. Now the meeting's adjourned. Please note the minutes. - Dexter! - Then they killed him. A completely innocent man, and my dear friend. - Terrible tragedy. - All because they couldn't figure out how he did his effect. - Nicholas always said it was the greatest act he ever saw. - I still miss him. - I know that this is hard for you, but we appreciate what you've done here today. - Yes, thank you. - If you would wait for me out front, I have something I'd like to give you to put in your museum. I would like to give you one of these pads for your museum. As you may know, Dexter would never perform his act without it. They were part of the routine. - Yes, Nicholas told me. You still have one of those? - One? I have several dozen inside. - And you've kept them all these years? - Yes, as a keepsake. But here, take one. - Thank you. - Go ahead, examine it. There are no trap doors. - And this is exactly what Dexter used to perform? - Yes, this is what we used. - Huh. - Thank you for telling us your story today, Caleb. You don't know what this means, though, to the association. No one ever didn't act like Dexter in the history of the art, and we plan to give it our highest honor and place in the museum. - That is very kind. - Any chance you'd change your mind and attend the ceremony? - It's not our way. - I understand. It's great to be with you. - Take care. - Caleb, may I ask just one more question? - Would that question be how did Dexter do his effect? I'm no mind reader, but even I can figure this one out. - Caleb, you're the only person alive who can reveal any information as to how this was done. I'm not asking you to tell us specifically, but is there anything you can say about it in our article? - Okay. I will answer your question, but with a multiple choice answer. Three choices, one for sure is the truth. You decide which one. Fair enough? - And then you tell, we will print. - How did Dexter do it? Choice A. Very, very well. Choice B. He really could read minds. Or choice C. Both of the above. Have a good day. - Wait, those are our choices? - Just believe, gentlemen. Humble yourselves and believe. - Well, Dan, I like the part with the word is strawberry and he showed up Maxwell. - Oh, yeah, yeah. I guessed the four of clubs to get that guy's money back. - Yeah. - Oh my gosh. - Hey, yo, Danny, we really, uh, we really appreciate you paying our way here tonight, man. - Ah. - You're a big time spender. - Yeah, I just thought it was interesting when I saw it last week. - Yeah. - Did you notice at the beginning- - Hey, donate some free popcorn next time, will ya? - Yeah, and a candy bar or somethin'. - Oh, hey, you guys remember the part where that girl was trying to trip him up by writing XOXO on it? But yeah, he still got it. - I'm parked over here, guys. Thanks for meeting me down here. - Did you get to talk to them? - They said they liked it. - Did you explain it to them? - I didn't get a good opening. - But I thought the whole idea why you paid for them to see the movie was that you wanted to talk to them about it so you could explain the parable. - I know, I know. I just, I tried to bring it up and then Lincoln cut me off. He kept walking to the car. - Yeah. Lincoln, he's, he's tough. - Yeah. And I guess I blew it. - You didn't blow it. - No, I blew it. I had an opportunity and I just chickened out. - Look, maybe you'll get another opportunity. - Here's the thing. It's like in class today I was talking to one of my buddies and he has no idea what to do, so I think the whole semester's just been confusing- - Hey, guys. - Hey, Danny. - Hey. All right. Now that Danny's here. Yo, what's this text about? - I came up with it. - Came up with what? - The name. - The name? - For intermural basketball team. - You texted us all to get together for that? - Wait, don't tell us. Let me read your mind first, okay? - What? - Just think of the name, Wyatt. Okay, the name of our team that you came up with is the Lizards. - Wrong, Dexter. It's the Bandits. And here's the tagline: we steal victories. - We steal victories? - We'd be lucky to steal two games. - Yeah, I still like the Lizards better. - But no way. Bandits is great. Plus, you have no tagline. What do lizards steal? - Ladies, both names are dumb. - Okay, I'm gonna let you guys argue about this one. I'll see you later. - Hey Danny, I was thinking about the movie this morning, and I remember there was this Bible verse at the beginning of it. Why was that there? It kind of felt outta place. - Uh. Yeah. Do you remember what it said? - I don't know. Something about like a parable? - That's right. The movie was supposed to be like a parable. - A parable? - A parable. They were stories Jesus told in the Bible to illustrate spiritual truths. - I don't see the connection. - Well, the character Dexter, he was supposed to represent Jesus because he could read minds just as Jesus could. And those pads, they were supposed to represent the word of God. Notice how Dexter never did his act without the pads? Just like Jesus doesn't do anything apart from God's word. - And we were supposed to catch all this? - Well, there were a lot of parallels to the Bible. I guess you guys just didn't notice them. Like Judy. She was supposed to represent Judas because he was the guy who betrayed Jesus. And she was just there to figure out how Dexter did the effect. And Nicholas, the one association member who ended up believing Dexter could really read minds is a picture of Nicodemus from John chapter three, who was a key religious leader who came to believe in the Lord. - And we were supposed to catch all this, too? - Uh, I guess. Remember the association guys? They were supposed to represent the religious leaders back in the Lord's day. They had Jesus killed just like the association did away with Dexter. Now, both Jesus and Dexter were totally innocent, but they were threats to the leadership, so they killed them. - Now, I'll say it. And we were supposed to get this, too? - I mean, yeah. - I don't know, my man. Seems like a bit of a stretch to me, don't you think? I mean, if you don't know your Bible, how would you pick up on any of this? - Well, when Jesus told parables in the New Testament, they didn't understand them either. - Then why would he tell them if they didn't understand? - I don't know. I guess maybe as a judgment to their unbelief. You see, the religious leaders were replacing God's word with their own traditions and doing their own thing. It's kinda like today. Well, actually, today people just ignore God's word and do their own thing. But when they die, they expect God to just let them into heaven as if they deserve it. - Yeah, well, if you're good enough, then why not? - Yeah. That's how most people think. - And you don't? - Well, what constitutes being good? - Ah, you know, not murdering anyone, being kind to people, that sort of thing. - And you're in? - Yeah, that's right. - But if that's so, then why did Jesus have to come and die on the cross? - Okay, well, I've really appreciated this religious discussion, but that's enough Sunday School for me. So I'm gonna head out. I'll catch you gentlemen later. Come on, Wyatt. - Later, boys. - We don't wanna talk about God, yet when we die, we expect him to just let us into heaven. - I suppose. - What about you, Logan? Do you think you'll go to heaven when you die? - Well, if Lincoln's right, then yeah, I think so. I'm a good person. I go to church. Well, not since I've been to college, but I used to. - The Bible says that we have to be perfect to get into heaven. - No one's perfect. - That's right. And that is where we have a huge problem. - Well, if nobody's perfect, how does anybody get in? - Well, that's where Jesus comes in and why He came. You see, He lived a perfect life and then died in our place to pay the penalty for our sins. And then He rose from the dead, proving He was God, and He did this to give you and me eternal life. - But if Jesus paid for our penalty, then doesn't that mean we're all gonna go to heaven? - No, that's not how it works. You see, we have to personally come to Jesus to receive forgiveness and then commit to following Him before it's too late. - And if we don't? - Well, I think you know what the alternative is, and I don't think you'll like that option. - What if Lincoln's right? - Lincoln doesn't have anything to back up what he's saying. And the issue is, what does the Bible say? You have a Bible, don't you? - Yeah, you know, in my room, but I never- - You should take some time and read it. Check out John 14:6. Just look it up. See what it says. - Chapter 14, verse six? - Logan, we're talking about eternity here. Life forever and ever. We all have to die one day. It might be years from now. It might be tonight. And if our sins aren't forgiven, we'll be separated from God for all eternity. Why take the risk? - Thanks again, Danny, for the movie last night. It was, it really good. - Hey, Logan. Do you remember what Caleb said at the end of the movie? Just humble yourselves and believe. That's what we have to do to receive eternal life. Just humble ourselves and believe in Jesus. I did, and it was the best move I ever made. You can, too. - Thanks again, Danny. - Hey, what's up, Logan? - Hey, guys. What are you doing? - Isn't it obvious? We're studying. Oh, come on. That was a good line. Why the long face? - Just thinkin'. - About what? - Well, I was at work today and I saw this guy who looked like the Dexter character from the movie, and when I went to go talk to him, he left. - Are you still thinking about that? - More about what Danny was saying yesterday. - Come on, man. You gotta let that go. It's just his opinion. - What if he's right? - What if he's wrong? - Yeah, but what if he's right? I mean, I want to go to heaven when I die. - You will. You're a good guy, Logan. I know you. You're okay. - Yeah, but like Danny said, then why did Jesus have to die? - Well, you can't take that religion stuff too seriously. - Well, Danny does. - Yeah, well, that's Danny's problem. - It seems like he knows though. - Takes that stuff way too seriously. - Maybe we should, too. - Kids. - "Jesus sayeth unto him, 'I'm the way, the truth and the life. No man cometh unto the father but by me.'" Lord, Jesus, I, I don't know what to say, but I believe what Danny says is true. I know that I've messed up and that I've sinned, but I know you've died from my sins. I wanna go to heaven when I die, and I'm willing to follow you. So please accept me. And please help me.
