You have your problems and I have mine. We should try to understand each other. The choice of the location is a hard one. It needs to be close to the road, easy to reach. An open space with some kind of a shelter. Why use our land for that? The past few years it was in Caijiapo, but it's been turned into a development zone. I read in the papers that injections are now being used. That costs money. Here, we can't afford it. Look, this is what I'm thinking. I know a place about twenty miles from here. Nobody goes there.
