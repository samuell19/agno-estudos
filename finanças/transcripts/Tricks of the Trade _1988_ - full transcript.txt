(MultiCom Jingle) (soft classical music) (muffled chatters) - [Man] That's my point. That's what I was trying to tell him before. - It has the potential to sizzle. You know that. - This guy comes up with this crazy idea. - Wait, just a minute. - I was trying to tell him that. In '64, you were talking about-- - Wait. - You said it's too dicey, yeah. No guts, no glory. - Would anyone like anything else? - I'm fine, thanks. - I couldn't eat another thing but everything was delicious, as always. - Yes, it was. - Thank you, Frank. - Donald, you are married to the woman of the century. - Oh, thanks. Thank you, that's what I keep trying to tell him. - And she does tell me over and over and over. (laughing) - Shall we have dessert in the den? What do you say? - Yeah. - Sure. - Absolutely. - And then we can take a hot tub. - [Woman] Perfect. - Yes. We have extra suits. - Who needs suits? - I'm game. - Yeah, who need suits? - Absolutely. - I think they're kidding. - Oh. (laughing) - I'm afraid I can't join you. I've gotta get to the office. - Oh honey. - I wanna there in the morning when Zurich opens. Gold's going crazy. - My God, you're dedicated. 6:00 A.M. is early enough for me. - No, Donald is just more ambitious than the rest of us. - It was a good party, don't you think? Everybody seemed to have a lot of fun. - [Donald] You outdid yourself, sweetheart. - Liz looked marvelous. She's going to that new weight doctor in Beverly Hills. What's his name? I'm thinking about going. - You don't need to go. - Oh Donald, you gave those up, remember? Will you be very late again tonight? - Probably. - Oh honey, that worries me so much. You work so hard. You know, Jim McCabe had a heart attack and he's only 40. - Catherine, nothing is gonna happen to me. Remember our 10 plan? I just need to close one more big deal and we're there. - I'm the luckiest wife in the world. - I'm the lucky one. But it'll probably be another all nighter, so don't wait up for me, okay? - All right. - See ya. - All right. Oh, your keys are on the back porch by-- - Right. - All right.

Where did your husband work? - Brice Dunbar, he's, was a stock broker. - How long have you been married? - Nine years. - Any problems with the marriage? - No, no, we were very happy. Donald was a wonderful husband. - How often did you see Todsen? - I don't know, once a week. - Oh, so he was a regular, huh? - He was a trick, Delroy. I think you know what I do for a living. - Maybe you liked him. Maybe you gave it to him for free. - He paid like everyone else. - (sighs) Yeah, he paid heavy. - Are you gonna charge me with something? 'Cause if you're not gonna charge me with something, I'm outta here. - You're outta here when I get good and ready to let you out of here. You understand that? - Oh, fold it four ways, Delroy. - Here. Come on. You set him up, right? You pimped him. - If you had another idea in your head, it'd be lonely. I don't have a pimp, I outlaw. - Did your husband often work late at night? - Yes. He was very ambitious. He had this plan to make five million dollars before he was 40. - Did you ever think he was seeing someone else? - No, that's ridiculous. - Yeah. - Why you asking me this? - I'm trying to determine why your husband was found where he was found. - Where was my husband found? - In an apartment. In Hollywood. - Who's apartment? - A prostitute's. - [Marla] It's been a real pleasure, Delroy. - Yeah, well, it's been a thrill for me, too. Listen, stick around, will ya? Don't take any long trips. - [Marla] Too bad, I'm gonna have to cancel my Caribbean cruise. - Hey, would you be so kind as to give this lady a ride home? - You're a real gentlemen, Delroy. - [Delroy] Thank you. - Hey, just for the record, it ain't exactly a good business practice killing johns, you know? - That's her, isn't it? - Yes. - [Police Officer] Okay, ma'am, let's go. - Catherine. - Miss Todsen. - Oh Frank. - Oh Catherine, I'm so sorry. - Oh Frank, I just can't believe it. - I know, I know. - How could he do it to me, Frank? How could he? - I don't know, Catherine. I just don't know. - [Police Officer] Three shots were fired and I'll just make sure this report-- - Come on, boys, I have a life. - All right, Jay, I'll see you later. Come on, ma'am. - I wanna see where that woman lives. - Oh, Catherine. - Where Donald died. - No, no. - Please Frank. I have to. - That's your worst possible thing you can do. - [Woman] Hey Marla. (muffled chatters) - Not just another woman but a prostitute. What was wrong with me? - Catherine, don't. - It's like I never even knew him. - How you like it? - Come on, come on. Come on, I got one quarter left. - Hey Marla. How you doing? - I'm okay. - Sorry to hear about the flap of your john, Marla. It couldn't be too good for business. - Give her a break, okay Tony? - Wasn't this one you were sweet on? You know, the regular? - Bite the wall, Tony. - Yeah. The one with the wife. - They all got wives. Hi Eden. - Hi. - I just heard. What a shock. I brought you some Godivas. Oh. Hi. It's such a loss. I just don't know what to say. - He was such a good husband. So devoted to you. - I'm very tired. - I bet you are. - I think I should rest. - Yeah, come on. - We should all go. - Why don't we all, sure. - Call me if you need anything. - Thanks, Sally. - [Howard] Goodbye. - Bye Howard. Bye. - Can you believe it? To have him go like that in the saddle? - Look Catherine, I know you don't know it now, but believe me, things are only gonna get better from here, okay? You just need a little time. - Why don't you go upstairs and get some rest and I'll take care of the funeral arrangements? - I don't want a funeral. I don't think he deserves one. - You don't have to have a funeral. You can do whatever you want. - Let me get you some Valium. - Catherine, Donald made a terrible mistake. But he worked really hard and you're gonna be very well taken care of. Okay? - Mm-hmm. - All right, get some rest. And I'll give you a call. - Thanks, Frank. - And whatever you need, anytime you call me, all right darling? - All right, Liz. Thank you, Liz. - Bye bye. - Bye bye. (knocking) - Mrs. Todsen, Stryker and Delroy. May we come in? - Yes, please. - It's all right? - Yes, yes. - Sorry to have to bother you at this time, ma'am. - [Catherine] That's all right. - [Delroy] Thanks. - There's just a few questions we have to ask you. - Oh please. Please, here. - Thank you. - You wanna tell us about your plans to go down to Rio with your husband? - What plans to go to Rio? - Weren't you going to Rio to meet your husband there? - I have no idea what you're talking about. - You must have an idea. I have his ticket right here. - Rio? He was going to Rio? (knocking) - Hey girl. You're not dressed yet. - Oh, I just can't tonight. Can you take Arnie alone? - Sure, I don't mind. The cops just left here asking me a whole lot of questions. Sure hope I didn't say the wrong thing. - I'm sure you were cool. - Girl, I thought you gave those things up for good. - Things change. - Yeah, well, you don't look too good either. Did you eat anything today? - I'm not hungry. - Not much here to cook with. Ah, but you got ice cream. - That stuff's not for eating. It's for Roy. - Yeah, I got one like that, Dave. He uses yogurt, he's on a diet. Now you gotta eat something or you gonna get yourself sick. Here. - You know that blood stain's not gonna come out. But girl, I got a trick in the carpet business. He can get you a brand new carpet and you can work most of it off. Oh and guess who's back in town? - Who? - Tiffany. Just finished doing time in Bruntier, right? On the stroll for 15 minutes and propositioned a undercover dick. - Bad luck. - [Beverly] Her planets must be real funky. (somber music) - I'm gonna miss him, you know? He was the only guy that was ever good to me. - [Beverly] Girl, don't. - What do the wives have that I don't? I mean, besides the right clothes and the right schooling, right table manners. - I told you a million times. Never get involved with a john. - Yeah, I know. Good enough to play with. - But not good enough to love, honey. Men are pigs. (knocking) - [Arnie] Beverly, I need my physical. - [Beverly] I'll be right there, Arnie honey. - What does that hooker have that I don't have? I mean, I thought I had a good marriage. I even thought our sex life was, you know, fine. How could Donald do this to me? I've always been such a nice person. - Maybe Donald didn't always want nice. - But I was brought up to have good manners, you know? To be polite, so was Donald. - Can you really be polite when your husband's been sleeping with another woman? - Well, I do feel betrayed. - Betrayed? You're furious. You're just not in touch with your anger. - No, I don't think I know how to do that. - Then maybe it's time you learned. - Hey fella, wanna party? (screams) (dog barking) (knocking) - [Marla] Yeah? - I'm Catherine Todsen, Donald's wife. - Just in the neighborhood and thought you'd drop by? - I need to talk to you. - Well I don't need to talk to you. - Look, this isn't easy for me. - Everything's easy for you. - [Walter] Marla. - [Catherine] Oh, I'm sorry, you have company. - [Walter] Marla. - Oh. - [Walter] Marla. - Look, this is office hours. - Listen, I just have to ask you something. - You wanted to see where a hooker lives. Well, now you've seen it. - Oh, no, no, no, wait, wait. (grunts) No, I need to know how long Donald was coming here. - What is this, female bonding? - Actually I'm trying to get in touch with my anger. - Oh, don't tell me, you just came from your shrink. - Look, it's not much to ask, is it? - Three years. Okay, two years and nine months. Now you can go back to your frigid Beverly Hills life. - It is not Beverly Hills. It's Brentwood and I am not frigid. For your information, Donald and I had a perfectly normal sex life. - Honey, any sex that's normal has to be far from perfect. - Marla, I've been a bad boy. - I'll be with you in a second, Walter. I gotta get back to work. Unless of course you care to join us. - No, thank you very much. - [Walter] Are you sure? - Yes. Yes. My worst nightmare. (motorcycle roars) What, what is this? (screams) (dramatic music) Hey, help, help. Stop, stop! (dog barking) Down boy, down, down. Stay. Okay, good boy, good boy. Stay, stay. (car horn honking) - Can I help? - That man stole my car. In front my eyes, he stole my car. - Not the best neighborhood. I'll be glad to drive you to the police station. - Thank you, oh thank you so. Oh, thank you so much. So humiliating, my car stolen. I don't know how to thank you. I'm so embarrassed. A lot of good my car alarm did. - [Man] I know what happened to your car. - What? - I know what happened to your husband. - We want it. - [Catherine] Want what? - You know what. - No, I don't know what. - Your husband stole it from us. - Stole what? - And you're gonna hand it over or you're gonna wind up just like him. - You've got two days. We'll be in touch. - My purse! Oh, no, no, my purse! This isn't happening to me. Oh goodness. Oh! - What? - Somebody stole my car. Then someone tried to kidnap, then someone else stole my purse. So now I'm stranded and I have no money. - You got bad karma, kid. - They wanted something they said Donald had. Now, would you know about that? - How the hell would I know about that? - Because maybe you killed Donald for it. - Maybe you killed Donald for it. - Why on earth would I want Donald dead? - Oh, let's see. He was sleeping with a hooker, you're on the insurance policy. I could go on. - Oh, I'll bet you could. - I see you're getting in touch with your anger. Congratulations. - Please, could I use your telephone to call the police? - [Walter] The police? - Breath through your nose, Walter. - Please. - I'll drive you to the station. Just promise me, you won't come back. - I promise. By the way, what is this you're wearing? - A business suit. I'll get my keys. - Hello. - Hello Walter. It's just been one of those kind of days. And thank you very much. Ooh, is this a cute car. I had one of these myself in college. Who'd thought they become a classic, huh? No seatbelts. Oh, weird. You know, we do a new seatbelt law. You could get a ticket. (tires screeching) Look out! Oh, oh, oh. - What would you put the value of your purse at? - Oh, $750. - Excuse me. - I bought it in Paris. - The value of its contents. - Oh gee, let me see. Well, there was a gold Tiffany keychain with keys, my Gucci wallet with matching checkbook cover, my Montblanc pen, my Cartier compact, all my makeup, all my credit cards, all my cash, all the Valium. Oh, I don't know, $2,500. - Let's move on to the car. Can you describe the man who stole it? - I only saw him for a second. But if I had to describe him, I could definitely say he was a thug. - A thug. - A thug. - Mm-hm. - [Stryker] Sign here please. - This is it? I mean, you're not going to do anything? - We'll look into this, Mrs. Todsen. Thank you very much. - But this other man, the one I told you about. Not the youngster who stole my purse or the thug who took my car but the one who tried to kidnap me, him I can describe. - Oh. - He had beady little eyes. Very bad breathe. And he was wearing an imitation leather jacket. - You sure it was imitation? - Mm-hm. Now he wanted something. - [Delroy] They usually do. - No, this had to do with Donald. It could be a clue. - A clue. - A clue. - Walter, I hope you were good. (mysterious music) (phone ringing) Yeah. - [Man] Listen honey, we want it back. You got two days to turn it over or you wind up like Donald, two days, got it? - (sighs) Mrs. Todsen. You come down here in a $50,000 car. You got a purse worth more money than most people make in a month. You are a typical west side liberal with too much money and too much free time on your hand. - Really? I'll have you know I'm a Republican. - Go home, Mrs. Todsen. - I just don't understand this. I mean, you're treating me as though I'm the criminal when I'm the one who got mugged. I'm the one who's car was stolen. I'm the one who almost got kidnapped. And you two stand there so smugly. Well let me tell you something, it's my taxes that pay your salaries and the least you can be is somewhat sympathic. - Let me tell you-- - You know, we pay taxes too, ma'am. - My husband was a law abiding citizen and so am I. - Your husband came down here looking for trouble and he found it and we're gonna do our very best to investigate that. - Can I have someone drive you home, ma'am? - Thank you for the water and crackers. I can manage myself. - Cancel that call. - [Police Officer] All right, come on, let's move it. - Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry. Oh, oh, you're chained. - Hey baby. - Pardon. Well, you have the right of way. - [Police Officer] All right, John, move it. Let's check it moving. - [Police Officer] You're on 02? - [Police Officer] Yeah, I'm working through the night. (tires screeching) - Get in. - Go away. - Now! - Do you have to yell at me? - Please. - Thank you. (buzzing) Oh, there are just flies everywhere. I'll have a chili cheese dog with everything on it. Onions, everything, sauerkraut if you have it. Piece of apple pie with ice cream, vanilla. Thank you. - You always eat like this? - When I'm under stress, yes I do. - Oh, you mean like when you have a manicure and a lunch in the same day? - You know, it's very impolite to smoke in a restaurant. Haven't you ever heard of secondary smoke? You know, you have a real mean streak in you. - Think so? - Yes, I do. - Well your husband didn't. - You see. - What? - What you just said. That was very mean spirited. - Well thank you for pointing this out. - Well I thought since we were talking, we might as well be open. - Okay, as long as we're being open, why don't you tell me what Donny was into? - I don't know what Donald was into. Donald never told me anything. - I can believe that. - Well what did he share with you besides the obvious? - A lot of things, we talked about a lot of things. For instance, he taught me about investing. I could be a stock broker now. - Oh good, Frank needs a new partner. - Look, I don't like this any better than you do but somebody's after both of us. - Well then we should go to the police. - Oh grow up. Cops arrest hookers. - No, the police are here to serve the public. Sort of like what you do. - Well at least I don't give it away. - I don't give anything away. - That's what Donny said. - I don't have to stay here and listen to your low class insults. - Yes you do, yes you do. Look, I don't like you and you don't like me. Okay fine but we need each other. - I do not need you. - You don't get it, do you? You don't get it. Donny screwed us both. We've gotta find out what kinda trouble he's gotten us into before we get nabbed by the cops or offed by those scum. - You mean killed? - Oh, wake up, Snow White. Prince Charming ain't coming back. It's us or the freaking witch. - You were right. Those sweet little ladies are working together. - Uh-huh. They are sweet, aren't they? I think we're gonna follow them wherever they go. (upbeat music) - I don't think I can do this. - Look, we got people to talk to. You walk around like Princess Di, we'll get the royal brushoff. Besides, around here it ain't safe. - I just don't feel comfortable. Maybe it's the vinyl. I won't wear that. I feel like a walking advertisement. - [Marla] That's the point. - Yes, if you've got something to sell. (gasps) - Jude, put this on my charge. You owe me $176. Nah. - What, they clash? - [Marla] Will you just trust me? - [Catherine] Well these shoes were definitely not made for walking. - Fine. - I wish I'd gotten glasses like yours now. I feel totally overdressed. - No, no, you could pull his off. - Really? - See that. - Just this belt is binding me. - Hey, hey. - Oh, no, Marla. I draw the line right here. I will not get tattoos. - Can you just drive the guy? - Yes. - Come on. Hey Louie. - Hey sweetie, how are the roses? - Oh, a big hit. - I did a dozen red, real classic. - Oh really, where? - Later. - Listen Louie, She's looking for a guy who ripped her off. - Can you remember what he looked like? - Oh yes, yes, yes. He has very bad breathe and he was wearing a cheap imitation leather jacket. - Face like a weasel. - Just my type. - Louie use to be a police artist. - Really? - Okay. Pick a nose. - Pick a nose.

I was just trying to do what I thought-- - Don't, don't try anything. Just go back to Brentwood and stay there. I don't wanna see you east of Beverly Hills. - But Detective Stryker, I'd like you to meet my friends, Liz and Frank. - What happened? - How are you? Are you okay? - I got my car stolen. - Oh, you're kidding. - You're kidding. They didn't steal your clothes, did they? - Oh, I can explain. - Oh, not the Jag? - Yes, the Jag. Oh, Liz. - You must be exhausted. - Oh, I'm starving. - Oh, maybe I have something. - Do you have a cracker? - Why don't I call Wolfgang? See if he can squeeze us in. - How about a muffin? - That'd be fine. - I'll call Michael or Rebecca or something. - This is okay. - I've arranged bail. We can just take off. - Oh, let's just get out of here. - Good, good, there's just one other thing. I'd like to arrange bail for Marla. - Fine, who's Marla? - Marla. - Isn't she the? - Yeah. - Not the? You don't mean the? - Yeah, Donald's friend, Marla. - Catherine, this is not your problem. - Oh, no, Liz, you'd like her, really. - Not that I don't wanna meet her. - I wanna introduce you. - No, wait, I gotta put my foot down. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But absolutely not. - You know, Liz is okay but I think that Frank wears his suspenders too tight. - Frank's all right. - People live here? - That's the general idea. - Everything matches. - Kinda like your boots and fringe. Condolence cards. Catalogs, ooh, mail order is so convenient. - Yeah, just the thing for the woman on the run. How many doors you got? - Oh, Marla, this is Brentwood. We're safe. Donald knew those men from your life, not from mine. - Right, are your windows locked? - I have a security system. - [Security System] House secure, good night. - [Catherine] So Donald talked to you about his work, huh? - Yeah, he did. He was a great teacher. I think I'm gonna get certified. Become a stock broker for the street. - Stock broker for the street, that sounds good. - Oh my, fashion risk. No pearls, what a statement. You know, even Nancy Reagan dares to wear red. - Well you know, sometimes subtle is preferable. - Yeah, when? Everything in this closet is beige. Maybe that's what was wrong with your marriage. Too beige. - Now Marla, who are you to tell me what was wrong with my marriage, huh? - Just an observation. - All right now, Marla. What are we looking for? - I don't know, drugs, money, jewels. He got a safe? - Here in the floor. - Where else? - Donald told me never to touch that. - What, you're afraid you're gonna be grounded? All right, the combinations over here in the Rolodex. Donald wrote it like a phone number. Only he dropped the first number and the rest is the combination. - I won't tell a soul. - All right, here we go. 16, 22, seven. What's that number again, 16? - 16, 22, seven. - That's gotta be it. Oh, oh my Lord! - What, what? - I could charge again, Donald's credit cards. - He lives on. (mysterious music) - Fuse again, I'll call security. - Catherine, Catherine, we gotta go. - Darn, it's dead. - Okay, and we're out of here. - It's safety regulated. It's just been that way. (screams) - Where you going? - [Catherine] Come on. Come on, quickly. - [Marla] What, what, where are we moving? - Come on. Okay, open that window. - Why? - Just open it. Suburban fire escape, catalog item. Chuck that out the window. - No, no. - Come on. - No. - Throw it out the window. (glass shatters) (laughing) - [Man] Ladies, come on. - Okay, okay. And Donald laughed at me when I bought this. - Hey ladies, ladies. We know you're here. - All right, you first. - No. - Go on. - No. - Go on, Marla. Come on, go on. Marla, what's the matter with you? Are you frightened of heights? - Shut up! - Don't make this hard. - Bye now. Come on, Marla, come on. Come on, Marla, come on. - Shut up, Catherine! - Don't tell me to shut up anymore. Marla, Marla, lift your foot, lift your foot. - Oh God, I knew it, I knew I was gonna die! I'm gonna die, no, no. My hands are slipping. I can't hold on. I can't hold on. - Marla, Marla, Marla. - Come on, let's go. Furniture's a little tacky, but it's got a great view. - Wait a minute, you're certain it's all right for us to be here. - Will you relax? - Will you quit saying that to me? I'm perfectly relaxed. I'm just concerned. If somebody walks in-- - We are perfectly safe. Ralph is away on location. He is a producer. - Oh, oh. Oh. Oh, you mean he produces. - Yeah. Chastity, now that was a good film. The wheel of foreplay, that was his masterpiece. (water splashes) Come on in, it feels great. - Oh, in a minute. I'm just going to unwind. - Catherine, it's chlorinated. - You know, Marla, I was just curious. Have you ever? - A film? - Mm-hmm. - No, I have a job. - Well, I know that. - I mean as a manicurist. That I have something to show the IRS. Also it's a great way to meet clients. Oh by the way, I gotta go there first thing in the morning. I gotta talk to Beverly. Gotta a brush? Oh, you know, you outta go to Donny's office and dig around. Dig around for what? - I don't know. Get his appointment book. You know, the last 24 hours of a victim's life are the most important when solving a crime. - [Catherine] Learn that from your close association with the police, no doubt. - I watch a lot of movies. - [Catherine] In between clients? - [Marla] Sometimes during. - [Marla] Oh, so that's how you get through it. - Get through what? - It. - It? - It. - Drink this. Are you interested? - Me? No. Well yes, all right, I'm interested in how you feel. - Well for me it's not that bad anymore. I've got my regular johns. It's like a job. It's like punching a clock. - Well, do you like it? - Do you? - Me? - You. - (sighs) Well, of course I like it. - Always, you never lied? - Well, maybe once or twice. - Oh. - But Marla. Making love with someone you love, someone who loves you, well that's a lovely thing. - I love seeing my bills get paid. - Yes but doesn't that scare you? I mean, it's dangerous out there. There are diseases. - I take care of myself. - All right, but I still say it's like playing Russian Roulette. - Not if you're ready when the gun goes off. - Look, a john comes to me, he plays by my rules or we don't play. If that's all right with him, then I'll give him anything he wants. What? - Oh, I just suppose that's what Donald saw you. No offense. - Are you worried? - What? - That he might've cared about me? - Did he? - Don't sweat it, Catherine. He was just another trick. - Did you care about him? - You know, he told me all about you once. He said you were perfect. You were the perfect wife. I was the perfect play thing. - Well, he had it all figured out, didn't he? - Yeah. But now it's our turn. What have you got there? - The obligatory condolence cards. With sympathy. With deepest sympathy. With sympathy and understanding. Oh good, a bill. $225 for the delivery of a floral arrangement. - Good Lord, what are the flowers made of in Brentwood? Platinum? - I suppose Donald sent these to you. - Are you kidding? I get flowers at Safeway for $2.49 and buy 'em myself. So who do you suppose he sent these flowers to? - Well that's easy enough to find out. Mm-hm. - What do I do? - Look like a collector. Do what I do. - Next item is lot number 10, a very fine Bakota relic. We shall start the bidding at 2,000. - I'm terribly sorry, this is a private auction. Invitation only. - Yes, well I'm Mrs. Donald Todsen and my husband has the invitation. He's meeting us here. - And I suppose this person is also on our guest list? - This person just happens to be the baroness. - Kaminski. - Kaminski. - Baroness. - Baroness. - Quite. - Now, if you could tell us where we might find Victoria Van Adams. - She's over there against the wall. - [Catherine] She's gorgeous. - You don't suppose Donny was cheating on us, do you? - Well, let's find out. Miss Van Adams? - Yes? - We're sergeants Friday and Thursday. - Monday. - Thursday, Monday. - Tuesday. - Wednesday. - All week long, L.A. Bunco. We're investigating an art forgery case. Very hush hush and we need your help. - Yes? - Last week you were sent a floral arrangement by Mr. Donald Todsen. - How did you know that? - That's our job. We were wondering, what is the nature of your relationship with Mr. Todsen. - I run an art gallery. Donald Todsen is one of my clients. He wanted to sell his collection of pre-Columbian art and I gave him a rather substantial advance. - Ah-ha, there is no Todsen on my list. You both have to leave immediately. - Look slime eyes, don't touch me unless you got a cenote in your pocket. I'm a baroness. - We were doing just fine in there until you opened your big mouth. - Oh, with your line of bull? All week long, what is that? - Oh, and what about your proposition to that man? - Hey, I got a proposition for you. You're on your own. - And better off for it, good luck. - Oh, good luck to you. - Better luck to you. - Gee, I'm sorry, Mrs. Todsen, but it appears none of your cards are valid. - Oh, no, no. Now that can't be, my cards are all full. - No, I tried. - Every one of them. - Well I tried them all. They're overdue and overdrawn. - No, that can't be. - They've been canceled. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to confiscate them. - No, not my card. - It's policy. - Oh, oh. - You know, there's a little place right down the street called We Rent Rex. All you need is $10 and a prayer. (sobbing) - [Frank] I can't believe it, Catherine. - There's nothing left, Frank. He even borrowed on our life insurance policy. - What about that bond fund? - No, he liquidated everything. Cashed out everything. What was he up to, Frank? You're his best friend. I mean, what was Donald thinking? - Well, I don't know. He'd been tense for a long time, but we've all been tense with this market going up and down like this. I don't know. I guess he was really on the edge and I just didn't see it. - Well, I guess I didn't see it either. - Catherine, I'll help you in any way I can. I care about you so much. If there's anything I can do. Look, I don't want you to be worried about money at a time like this. It's hard enough. And if this isn't enough, I want you to tell me, okay? - Well thanks, Frank. - Would you please do me a favor and stay away from that, the, that, you know. - Marla? - [Frank] Yeah, Marla. - Oh, I won't be seeing Marla anymore. - Beverly, hang on. I gotta talk to you. - [Beverly] Hey, I got nothing to say. - Beverly, you got to tell me what's going on. - Hey, don't press me. Now won't you do yourself a favor and just stay out of it. - Please don't do this to me. - Look, I can't talk here. So, why don't you meet me after work at my place? But you gotta promise me that you won't say I told you anything. - Yeah. - [Tony] Marla, you got a customer waiting. - I'm coming, I'm coming. - Yeah and so is Christmas. - Hey Beverly, looking damn good, yeah. Hey Marla, what's happening? - Don't tell me, change at the machine. - Hey Tony. You did a little cleanup, huh? Hey, nice color. - On you. (employees chattering) (soft somber music) (coughing) (detectives chattering) - They get fed up, they get bored. They can't find a game. - Hello. - What are you doing here? Didn't you see this? - Oh, I ducked under that. - Uh-huh, what do you have back there? - Where? - Behind your back. - Nothing. - Let me see your hands. - The other hand. - Both hands. - What is this? - That's sentimental. - It is not sentimental. - This is sentimental. - That is sentimental. - This isn't. - I can explain this. Let me explain it to you please. You see, what happens is I think I've uncovered. - No, no, no, stop. - I'm trying to help you. Now something is going on that I think-- - This is the end of it. I warned you before. The next time you interfere in police business, you are going to jail. - Just listen to me. - Stay out of it! - Beverly. Beverly, you here, hun? (suspenseful music) - Marla? Marla. Marla? Ah, there you are. But then, where else? Marla, I went to Donald's office like you told me to do and I found his appointment book. Unfortunately, Stryker walked in and took it away from me. - You're hopeless. - But not before I managed to rip this out. Donald's last day. Come on, Marla, give me some credit. - Beverly's dead. - What? - Someone gave her a hotshot. They wanted to make it look like an accident. But it wasn't an accident. - Here you go. - Thank you. Come on, Marla, eat your hamburger. It'll make you feel better. - I told you, I don't eat red meat. It depresses me. - Well then at least eat the bun. The sesame seeds are good for you. - Yeah and ketchup's a vegetable. - Look Marla, I know how awful you must feel. I know Beverly was your friend, but you've gotta pull yourself out of it, Marla. Remember, it's us or the freaking witch. That a girl. - So can you make anything out of this calendar page? - Well it looks like a typical day. - Haircut, lunch at Jimmy's with Marguilies. Who's Marguilies? - He's a client. - Oh, workout with trainer, racketball game after work, dinner party. Well no wonder Donny had money problems, he never worked. Bolero '76, what's that? - It's a wine. - Did you serve it that night at dinner? - (gasps) Don't be ridiculous. Donald brought up a '66 Chateau Lafite from the wine cellar. - The wine cellar. - The wine cellar! Donald kept bottles down there with phony bottoms to hide things in. He got them during the '70 for his pot. When we did that sort of thing. - You smoked pot? - We gotta get to the house, Marla. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. You smoked pot? - You'd never know it to look at me, would you? - Do you have a gun? - Donald and I voted against guns. - So did I but we need a gun. - Well doesn't it take several weeks to register one. - Not in the real world. - You know, Marla, I don't mind coming to a place like this, but I would like to kinda serve my tapioca pudding. Oh, oh, fortune cookies. - Fortune condoms. Hi Larry, how you doing? Look, could you tell Allen I'm here please. - Oh, here we go, edible... - Undies. - Oh my goodness, look at this stuff. Well now these are kind of cute, these little teddy bears with their little matching leather outfits. Marla, Marla, what is that thing? What is that? (gasps) And what is that? That's so huge with those things sticking out from. Oh, you don't actually plug that thing, do you? - No, that would be extra. - Oh. What are you suppose you use that for, huh? - Putting out fires, it's a fire extinguisher. - Oh yeah. Oh no, this, this is truly disgusting. Look at these clothes, would you? I mean, don't you have something like this? I mean, with the little belt with the skull on it. - Marla? Hey sweetheart, it's nice to see you. - Hi Al, good to see you too. Allen, I want you to meet Catherine. Catherine, Al. - Hello Catherine. - Hello Al. Nice to meet you. Nice place you got here. - Al, we need a gun. - Well, glad to see you finally came to your senses. I've been after her for years to get something. - Oh, me too. - Come on in the back. I'll see what I can do for you. - Great, we got a gun. - Yes, well, you hold the gun. I'll try and figure out a way to get us into the house without being eyeballed. - Eyeballed? - Eyeballed, you know, spied upon. I wouldn't touch that rail if I were you. (Italian music) Pizza, pizza? - Catherine, we're in. - My house charge at Mario's finally paid off. - Don't turn on the lights. - You're right. - Someone could be watching the house. - I think this is, yes, this is the vegetarian. - Catherine, forget the pizza. Where's the wine cellar? (phone rings) Well admit it to me. - Oh, the answer phone will get that. - Okay. - Pick up in a little bit. - [Machine] Hi, this is Catherine. I'm not home and Donald's dead. Leave a message, take as long as you want. - Yeah Catherine, this is Frank again. Sorry to bother you but I didn't hear back from you and I'm starting to worry. - Forget Frank. - [Frank] Would you please give me a call as soon as you get the message? - Wait, he's worried. - Bye. - Dedicated. You always work this late? - [Frank] Who are you? - A client of Don's. I didn't catch your name. - Oh, I'm sorry. Frank Stedman, you must be. Now wait, wait a minute. What's the gun for? - Gun, gun, he's got a gun. We've gotta call the police. - No, we can't. Frank's on the phone. - Tell me, Frank. Why's Don's office sealed off? You having trouble, Frank? - None that I can think of. Well Donald's dead. - That's trouble. Sit down, Frank. - Yeah, thanks. - Close friends? - Yes, we were. - Great, then you can tell me who's gonna see about giving us back our $700,000? Your close friend, rest his soul, liked to gamble a lot. - $700,000? - [Frank] He owes $700,000 gambling? - Yeah, Donny liked to gamble. - [Man] Yeah, too bad he wasn't good at it. - Well, I wish I could help. - We'll get it, somehow. My boss is a very motivated man. So Frank, from now on, you be more careful how you pick your friends. All right, don't work so hard. Stress can kill you. - [Catherine] Frank! - What? Catherine. - Frank, are you all right? - [Frank] Yes, I'm fine. - He's fine. - Good, good, come on, let's go. - I have to go now, Frank. - Wait, wait a minute. Catherine, this is getting out of hand. What's going on? - We're disguised as pizza men right now. - Ciao, Frank. - Catherine, wait! - Oh, this is just great. I'm going to end up owing some gangster $700,000. (Marla laughs) You find my financial status amusing? - What financial status? - What? - Oh, come on, Catherine, lighten up. You're not the only one losing revenue, you know. - [Catherine] And what revenue are we speaking? - All right, all right, there's Artie on Monday and there's the senator on Tuesday. There's the Texas oil twins. Oh no, not the Texas oil twins. - I'm not broke. I mean, all these bottles of La Tasch alone must be worth $4,000. - Well there you go. See, the American dollar is soft against the frank so you may not be as bad off as you think you are. - I could have a garage sale. - Yeah, a garage. - Yeah, what would I need a garage for? - (laughs) You don't have a car. - I don't have a car. I don't think that's funny. Where is that bottle of Bolero? (gasps) This is it! - Okay, okay, okay. Where's the? - It's in the bottom. - [Marla] Oh my God. - Bank of Bakersfield. - What's in there, what is it? - [Catherine] Coins. What would Donald be doing with coins from the Bank of Bakersfield? - [Marla] Bank of Bakersfield. Where have I seen that? - [Catherine] That is the vilest wallpaper I have ever seen. (crunching) - Would you stop with the interior decorating? We're looking for something here. Must you? - Must you? - Look, look at this. I've never seen one of these before. We don't bank in Bakersfield. - Oh my Lord. (suspenseful music) Armored car. Do you suppose this as a heist? - Bank of Bakersfield. Tony hit an armored car. - That's a federal offense. Armored car robbery in Buffalo. Armored car robbery in Brunswick. I can't look at any more microfilm, Marla. I feel my crow's feet are setting in. - I got some great eye cream. - Nothing works, I tried everything on the market. - Let me see. Oh, yours aren't bad. Mine are must worse than that. - You? - Yeah, I'm eventually gonna have to get 'em done. - Oh, no, your eyes look great. - Really? - Yes, I mean, if you need yours done, then I should've had mine done years ago. - Would you crank? You crank. Whoa, wait, stop, stop. Get a load of this. An armored car was ambushed yesterday when the driver stopped to aid a woman who appeared to have been injured in a car accident. - Taken were five million dollars in bearer bonds. $70,000 in gold double eagle coins and $500 in quarters. The suspects who are still at large include the woman who was apparently the decoy and four men say Bakersfield Police. - Four men, okay, okay. Tony, Eddie. - The thug. - The thug. - The thug driver. - Thug driver. - Do you think Beverly was a decoy? - Probably. They thought they hit the jackpot. - Only, there's no money and the bonds are worthless. - Unless of course they have a broker who can convert them into cash. - [Both] Donald! - Yes, yes! - Wait, wait. Tony and Eddie. Tony and Eddie must've paid him off in the double eagle coins. - Oh yeah. Well, if he did convert the bonds at Brice Dunbar, I know how to find out. (dramatic music) - Okay Catherine, here's what you're asking about. It's Donald's full commission report. - Thanks, Frank, let's see. Here we go, right here. Right here, Donald converted five million dollars two days before we was killed. - Yes. - He what? - Oh Donald was associated with some low lives who robbed an armored car. - Catherine, what are you talking about? - We're outta here, Frank. - Aren't you gonna tell me about this? - [Marla] Next week we'll have lunch. - It's been real, Frank. - Catherine. - Five million dollars. Where would've he put it? His plane left at 2:40 which means he had to hide it somewhere between your place and the airport. That's it! - His car! - Yes! The police impounded his car. - Turn left there. (upbeat music) - Now what, Marla? - Okay, okay, you fluff the guard. I'll hotwire the car. - I don't know what that means, fluff the guard. - Flirt with him, get his temperature up. - Oh, no, no, I can't do that. - Catherine, have you ever been in a play? - Yes, in high school I was in the Sound of Music. - Don't tell me, you were Mother Superior. - (gasps) How did you know that? - Stretch. Go on. - Marla. - Can I help you? - Well, you know, I saw you sitting in there all alone and I thought to myself how lonely that poor man must feel. - Really? - Yes, I mean, with nothing to do all day but sit in that little booth and look at nothing but empty cars with empty backseats. - It does get kinda lonely. - Really? - I got these chapped lips. - Oh, that's too bad. No, no, thank you. - Would you like to come into my booth and listen to some music? I got the new Jim Neighbors cassette. ♪ God didn't make little green apples ♪ ♪ And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime ♪ ♪ There's no such thing as Dr. Seuss ♪ ♪ Disneyland and Mother Goose ♪ ♪ No nursery rhymes ♪ - We got company. - Great.

(laughs) - What are they doing? - Based on 20 years experience on this job, I'd say they were tearing a Mercedes apart. - No, let me rephrase that question. Why are doing that? - My God, this brings back memories. Bolts popping, car body like putty in your hands. - Kinda like the good ole days, huh Al? - Don't get him started. - Listen, you kids don't know what it was like. We knew how to make a stash job look smooth. - Yeah, well, that's what's wrong with the world today. No class. - You're telling me. No job pride anymore. Hey, you're doing great, girls. - Not bad, huh? - How about I go make us some fresh coffee. - Oh, that'll be lovely, Al. Decaf if you have it. - It'd be a pleasure. I haven't had this much fun in years. - So, what's it gonna be Marla? Tex Mex, Chinese, Italian? We can order out. - I swear, you are the most orderly fixated person I've ever met. - I told you, I like to several small meals a day. What's wrong with this thing? Marla. - Catherine. - Marla, look at this. Now who's phone number would Donald hide in there? - Well let's find out. - Well, we can't on this phone. - Well, let's use Al's. - Great. - Al, hey Al, can we use your phone? I think we found. (gasps) (dramatic music) - Surprise. - Let's go in. - If we go in there now, they're gonna claim they're buying party favors or something. Let's give 'em a little time to make it interesting. - Your days are up, ladies. - Yeah, you got something nice for us? - Not in this lifetime. - Even if we did, you'd never get it. You killed my husband, you murderer. - Us? Why would we kill him before we got our money? - You're lying, murderer. - Donald was up to his ass in trouble. Could've been anyone who did him. - Yeah, well it wasn't anyone who knocked off an armored truck. - That's right, we found the quarters. - Well how we got 'em is our business. - I told you, you should've taken 'em. You're a stupid idiot. - I took 'em, okay? Because the pinball machines were always running out of quarters. - Well what about Beverly? Which one of you offed her? - Offed? What the hell did you do? You said you were just gonna keep her quiet. - Yeah, well she's quiet now, ain't she? (grunting) - That sounds interesting. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Now what do we do? - I don't know. - [Stryker] All right, nobody move. Everybody freeze, police. - Everybody assume the position, thank you very much. - Glad you could make it, Delroy. - That's all right. - [Marla] Watch out! (dramatic music) - Get out! - Son of a. - Ladies. (screaming) Can you give me one good reason why shouldn't arrest? - Yeah, we solved your crime. - Almost. - These are the men who killed my husband. - The thugs, right? - Thugs. They told you they killed your husband. - Yeah, and if you're real nice to us, we'll tell you everything. - First thing in the morning. - All right, 8:00 my office. You buy the doughnuts. - You buy the doughnuts. I don't get up till 10:00. - Nine o'clock. - And decaf! I don't believe it. I mean, we go through all that trouble to get a gun and then you don't even shoot anybody. You shoot a wall. - I meant to shoot a wall. Give me that number, what's the number? - All right well, let's see. 555-2731. - [Speaker] Morning clouds tomorrow. - Yeah right, Donny was into the weather wizard, yeah. - All right, all right. What if it's not a phone number? What if it's a combination or something? Like a combination to a lock. Like Donald had written on the Rolodex in the study. - Okay, a combination to a lock. A lock to what? - When I was in Donald's office, all his gym stuff was in his desk drawer. - So, it's in his locker at the gym. - Yes, give me a quarter. - Okay, okay. - I'll call Frank. He'll get us into the gym. - Here, come on in. His locker's right down here. - Now Frank, see, it's written like a telephone number but we thought if you dropped the first number and use the next six numbers, it's a combination. Then it would open the lock. - Right, but you see, that's not Don's combination. I'm telling you. His combination's 18, 22, 25. - You do it, you're good with zippers. Any money? Beach clothes, Rio. - Everything but the straw hat. Well, obviously he was gonna stop here on the way to the airport. So let's look at this number again, think. - Wait a minute, what if the five is the locker number? What if he didn't drop the five and the rest, yes. - Okay, five, locker number five. - Yes and the rest is a combination. - It's right over here. (suspenseful music) - Open it. - Oh my goodness. - Ooh yes. - Oh my goodness. - There was something in Donald's locker. - Oh, Marla. Look at this. - Catherine, we did it, we did it! - [Frank] Hey girls, girls. Come on here, look what I got. - Okay. - Put the bag down right now slowly. Thank you. - Oh Frank, no. - Not the best friend. - Oh yeah, let me tell you about my best friend. You know when they came to Don with this idea of cash in stolen bonds. Catherine, he thought it was great. And then he got scared. He was afraid he was in over his head. And so as always he said, Frank, you solve it. And I said, sure, Don, as always. But then he double crossed me. I knew he was smooth but I never dreamed he was capable of anything so clever. So, when I shot him, I assumed the money was still in his bank account, but apparently he cashed it all out the day before. So you see, I never would've found it without your help. What can I say? Thank you. - You're welcome. - Which way? I can't see anything. Is he behind us? - Right here, right here. - Where, where? - Catherine. Come on, Catherine. Come on out of there. I've got a gun, don't make me use it. (energetic music) I see you, come on. Go out the door and get in the car. - You are one sick tic, Frank. - I thought you cared about me, Frank. - Catherine, I do care about you. Not a lot but I care. (phone rings) - Hollywood Division, Drumble speaking. Yeah, I think they're here. Let me check, hold on. Stryker, Delroy. (police siren wails) - You know, Marla, your profession has served us well. - So this is what five million dollars looks like. Say Catherine, if this was our money, what would you do with it? - Oh, but it's not our money. - Yeah, but just say that it is. - Oh, but it isn't. - Can't you fantasize about anything? - Well, let's see, I'd buy a house. - Oh, come on, fantasize. Have fun with this. - Okay. I'd get myself a leather top like yours. - In beige? - No, in a dusty rose. How about you? - Let's see, you know, I'd really like to have a bed like yours. Like that canopy bed with the lace all over it. I thought that was really pretty. - Yeah, uh-huh. - Where are they? - In here. - Very nice. - This guy's alive, cut them down. - I knew you couldn't just go home and stay out of trouble. - [Catherine] Well thank you. Thank you very much. - Well at least we called you, Delroy. - Thank you very much. Now if those other guys were the thugs, who's he? - Oh, that's Donald's best friend. - And murderer. - What? - Here's a weapon. - And five million dollars. It's a long story. - We're all ears. - Well, my friend, Catherine, really can't talk on an empty stomach. - In the pursuit of justice, we have missed many important meals. - Well come on, I'll buy you both a cup of coffee. What do you say? - [Marla] How about a reward? - [Catherine] How about an apology? - [Stryker] Wait outside, we'll catch up with you. - Hurry up, I'm starving. - Now isn't that funny, I'm not. - Ah-ha, and I thought we'd agree on something. - What and spoil a perfect relationship? - Where are my cigarettes? - They're back there. - What? - You gave up smoking. - When? - Three minutes ago. - Why would I do that? - Because it's bad for you. Come on, forget it. So now that all this is over, you going back to. - [Marla] Hooking? Yeah, I guess so. At least until I get that stock broker thing together. What about you? What are you gonna do? - [Catherine] Well, I have a BA in romance languages and a masters in English literature. - [Marla] You need a job. - [Catherine] I need a job. (upbeat music)
