Saurabh, Sukhiram Come soon. The gentleman came. - Hello, Master. - Welcome. So Narayan. How is the harvest? Sir, when your heart is golden, so are your fields. Doesn't gold grow? Well, Narayan, when the harvest is over. Send one hundred sacks of grain to Ramnagar. I'm opening an orphanage there. - Sir. - What's the matter, Madhav? There is a message, sir. Madhav, your young master is coming tonight. Take the cart and go to the station at nine tonight. - Sir, I'm going to eight. - Why is that? Sir, this is monsoon season. Reaches quickly due to slipping on rails. You're a joker. Come and sit down. God wants to give this master my life too. He released me from prison. He saved me when I tried to commit suicide. Give me a plot of land to live in... ... sent my daughter to town to study. Who in the world today is helping so much? Of course he is a god to me. To Basantpur, a third class ticket. The train is about to leave. Hurry Up. Ah... this is first class! pardon me. This is because the train started its journey. I'm getting off at the next station. But who asked you to come down? I made a mistake and hurried into this cabin. I have a third class ticket. It's a cheap bug. You are losing.... ... if you took a first class ticket and entered a third class compartment. Why are you standing? Sit down. please sit down. Oranges? Grapes? I have a sore throat. But these are sweet, eat. - Sweet, isn't it? - Yes. No, thank you. - Where are you going? - Basantpur. So, we are on the same side. - I am also going to Basantpur. - Basantpur, to whose house? - To the palace. - To the palace... to the landlord's house? Why did you stand up when you heard the landlord's name? Not afraid. With respect. My father farms under him. It was with the help of that landlord that I learned this and came back. Today my teacher training is over. How can I sit like that in front of his cousin? please sit down. I have nothing to do with him. I go there for a job. Yes. But you do not look like an employee. Don't get me wrong. You too cannot be called the daughter of a farmer. The look can be deceptive. all right. What job do you do there? Occupation...? Yes, I am an electrician there. I like lamp repair and wiring and so on. Take this. Two made the same mistake. A car was coming to pick me up from the landlord's house. I'll put you home too. No, please. This is not a city but a village. When someone sees us, everyone talks. Is that so... then when will we meet again? It was a random encounter on the train. This is enough. - Really? - Yes. Get some grapes for your dad. No, they are sour. - The grapes are very sweet. - No, they're sour. - Sour? - Yes. Madhav. You...? - Yes, sir. - Go, unload. Okay, sir. I feel strong after eating grapes. Was the train late? No, sir. The train arrived on time. But he was the only one who applied the brakes. Madhav. all right. Eat dinner now. Guys did you eat anything? I ate on the train. Why is that? Is there a train service with the ticket? No, Dad. Looks like you forgot to eat. Like still on the train. Boy, are you sleepy or did you leave it on the train? I didn't leave anything out, Dad. I brought something. Look at this. My pass certificate. What are you showing me, baby? To an ignorant man like me, the letters look like a buffalo. Go, get some rest. Would you please tell me the route to Rupnagar? Rupnagar cannot be reached from this side. I see an image in front of me. Cities should be here too. You...? I meant sir. There is no place to look. Where did you get this horse? From the landlord. This landlord is a very good man. He treated me well last night and gave me this gun too. Go hunting this horse this morning. Yes, our prince is a very good man. The prince is good, and so are his subjects. What are they? So are you. Remember the Lord in the morning. This is not the time for jokes. Find your hunt. - Someone hunted me down. - How is that? Someone did that to me on the train last night. An evil arrow, it pierced my heart. so what? You know how to repair broken wires. - Repair your heart yourself. - The heart is not a toy. Yes, their own heart is valuable to everyone, but they think... - That other people's hearts are toys. - Not everyone is like that. all right. Say whatever I want. - Do you have that toy? - Not a toy. I have a heart. - Does it move? - Only for me. Not to anyone else? Your mind is a very selfish one. I like the way it is. Miss grapes, Miss grapes! Why do you call me that? My name is Gayathri. It's nice to hear this name first thing in the morning. Where will we meet tomorrow? - You mean? - Did I mean here or somewhere? It does not happen here or anywhere else. Look, this is unfair. I am a stranger in your village and does anyone break a visitor's heart? That heart... who knows what disease it is. Only the sufferer knows about it. It was a night I could not bear. Do not worry. God will save you. What is it? If I have been like that to my heart, there is no one to grieve for me, you see about it. If you have a heart attack, treat it. If you ignore it, it will not be curable. Do you understand It doesn't matter. - Madhava. - Yes, sir. Where is the gentleman? - Sir, he's gone out to breathe. - So long ago? Yes, here he comes. - Kamal. - Yes, Dad. Why did you go out alone? Did you not take an employee? Employee... Am I still a child? Certainly you are a prince, not a child. Son of a landlord. There should always be an employee with the rich. Father, is this a sign of prosperity that should always exist? - You mean a slave with you? - Now we have real freedom. - Madhav. - I'm quiet, sir. The situation of the poor was gone, Dad. Going after the rich. If this is a new world, then this world must extend freedom. The servant does not obey his master. The young man disobeys his elder. Is this a progress? Look at this. This is a letter from our agent in Singapore. Its workers have harassed them endlessly. If the situation worsens, one of us will have to go to Singapore. Dad, can't you handle it without going there? The agent is very upset. I have worked very hard to make this rubber project. If I lose it, it's like losing respect. I should have gone to Singapore today, but the doctor... ... I'm not allowed to travel by air. Because my blood pressure is rising. Why are you upset, Dad? If you want to go there I will go. You came back years later. How can I remove you from my eyes now, son? I'm not leaving forever. Let's see somehow. Now, take your bath and eat. - Good. - Come on, sir. The water is boiling. Only the sufferer knows about it. The guest is right. The arrow hits the target. "Someone tell me why the place where the heart hurts" "Do not shoot the arrow, ask where the heart is." "Ask where the pain is." "Someone tell me why the place where the heart hurts" "Do not shoot the arrow, ask where the heart is." "Ask where the pain is." "I do not know where the sleepiness in my eyes went" "Flying at night" "I do not know where the sleepiness in my eyes went" "Flying at night" "The poor lover is leaving..." "... when she sees someone else near her own" "Someone tell me why the place where the heart hurts" "Do not shoot the arrow, ask where the heart is." "Ask where the pain is." "Because it's on my mind." "Shake like that" "Because it's on my mind." "Shake like that" "That means I'm someone else's now." "Someone tell me why the place where the heart hurts" "Do not shoot the arrow, ask where the heart is." "Ask where the pain is." "When there is pain on this side..." "... make sure the reason is love" "When there is pain on this side..." "Make sure the reason is love" "Then what is the use of love that robs you of your peace?" "Someone tell me why the place where the heart hurts" "Do not shoot the arrow, ask where the heart is." "Ask where the pain is." "Someone tell me why the place where the heart hurts" "Do not shoot the arrow, ask where the heart is." "Ask where the pain is." - Hello, Master. - How are you, Narayan? - Is this your daughter? - Yes, Master. bless you. Sir, as you said, I taught her well. Of course, good. When you look at her, no one will say she's your daughter. Looks like she belongs to a rich family. And marry her to a better place. If you said so, it would definitely happen. "Orphanage - Ramnagar" "Orphanage - Inauguration Ceremony at Ramnagar" Brothers and sisters! We are all indebted to the landlord. The life of this householder has been spent in charity. This orphanage was donated... ... another development has taken place in his noble life. Now I invite his son Kamal Kumara... ... to open this orphanage at this auspicious time. Thank you all so much... ... about coming to this work. This orphanage was created because of orphans. I mean, about these orphans. Orphanage is definitely a useful thing, thank you guys! Gayathri, listen to this! Why did you want to deceive me? Why did you lie to me? I'm thankful to have known the truth before... ... before problems arise. I'm sorry, Gayathri. I had reason to lie. If I had said then I was the son of the landlord. You are not afraid to talk to me. Why did we need to talk? Son of a landowner and daughter of a poor farmer. These are lies. Love does not have those limits. Do not deceive me with sweet talk. After all, I can never be worthy of your love. Why is that? In what way are you inferior to me? In what ways am I similar to you? With us, your family will be discredited. My dad and I are joking. It's good that we're separated before something happened. Gayathri you will not believe me. I will marry you. No... no. Do not say the word marriage out of your own mouth. The consequences of this pleasant dream will be very bad. This is your magic, your fear. To make you believe, I make you mine before God tonight. The temple at the top of the hill. How can this be done? Neither your father nor my father will ever accept this. My dad kills me. When the marriage is over, everyone will be quiet. Today, in this hot moment, so to speak. All of that tomorrow. You will forget. Gayathri Do not insult my love. Is there anything in my life other than your love? Do you want to see me suffer for the rest of my life... ... keeping only thoughts about you in mind? Should I be a joke to the world? No... no. I do not wish so. But there is no other way, right? My mind is so confused. Gayathri, I will be with you my whole life. Say yes for once. Please say so. Okay, never mind. No more tears. Laugh. Ready. One. Two. Three. Should I go now? Tonight. Don't forget it. Even the walls have ears. Everyone knows me. I know your secret. Why are you afraid? Madhav. You...? Laugh. Go and laugh. one. two. Say three. come down. Come down. - Hurry Up. - I'm coming, sir. Sir, you were scared of even the smallest thing. The path of love is full of problems. Just imagine that the big gentleman found out about your marriage. - Then what happens? - Madhav. You can tell Dad. Then I will not put your tongue out. Sir, how can I tell the big gentleman? I too am a worshiper of love. How can I be the enemy of lovers? So, you're a good boy. God, you are a witness to this union. - There is another witness. - Madhav, you know this secret. Sir, I have a little sense of this too. I am also a person who respects love. do not be scared. I will not tell anyone. Congratulations on your wedding. - Where are the sweets? - Get out of here. Please God be pleased. Keep everyone happy. What kind of marriage is this? No one was happy. No entourage, no music. Train performed the function of providing music. Those tourists became my entourage. God is also pleased with this union. The night you got married, tears in your eyes. The mind is happy, but the eyes are crying. If I have sinned, to wash away my sins... ... with my own tears. Don't say things like this tonight. Laugh. Ready. One. Two. Three. "Looks like the moon is gone" "Where did the moon go?" "You should not have removed your face mask" "What happened to the moon?" "What happened to the moon?" "You never had a laugh like this." "Where did the moon go?" "Love is so young, the night is so beautiful" "Earth stops moving today" "Love is so young, the night is so beautiful" "Earth stops moving today" "Because I started looking at the stars." "Because I started looking at the stars." "You should not have awakened the magic of love like this." "Where did the moon go?" "Where did the moon go?" "You should not have removed your face mask" "Where did the moon go?" "Lost in love, where did you go?" "Why aren't my eyes dreaming?" "Lost in love, where did you go?" "Why aren't my eyes dreaming?" "This is the destination of two hearts" "This is the destination of two hearts" "If you hadn't come I wouldn't have either" "Out of the moon, why is this happening?" "Out of the moon, why is this happening?" "You shouldn't have laughed like this." "Where did the moon go?" "Where did the moon go?" I will never let this happen. - Madhav. - Yes, sir. Tell Kamal to come. Yes, Dad. Kamal This is a question of my honor. What happened, Dad? Read this message. Some enemy set fire to the rubber plantation. Great damage has been done. Dad, how did this happen? I do not know whose this is. I'm frustrated. Kamal you have to go to Singapore tomorrow. - But... - What do you mean by but? If my health is good I will go alone. I value the Singapore estate a lot. All the property I own today is earned through dedication. This is the Singapore estate. Dad, can't our agent solve the problem? If the agent is so talented this situation will not occur. Dad, this garden must have been lost to us. We have a lot of property. Why chase lost wealth? Avoid the problem as if you were newly married. Then you were ready to go. So why is this happening today? If this is your command, I'm not going back, Dad. It is not an order, it is your duty. You're sorry, why is that? - I have to carry out my father's orders. - what is that? I was told to go to Singapore tomorrow. Some enemy set fire to our rubber plantation there. I do not know what to do. On the one hand, this is my duty. You, on the other hand, are my love, my life. Who should I go with? I will solve the problem. Your father is now your father, not just mine. It is not only yours but also my duty to obey his command. - You go to Singapore. You have to go there. - Gayathri! Are you saying...? No, the landlord's niece says. Your wife says. Until coming from Singapore. No one knows the secret of our marriage. Gayathri. How great you are. Your face is beautiful and your heart is beautiful. tell me. What should I bring you from Singapore? You return safely. That's all I want. I will bring a symbol of love to my Gayathri. Souvenir of our first meeting. - Yes. - Yes. Mr. Kamal. I wish you success in the work you do. - You go and return safely. - thank you. - Are you looking for someone, son? - Yes? No, Dad. all right. Look, son. Take care of your health. - Yes, Dad. - bless you. God bless you. Let's go, Master. Madhav, give this envelope to Gayathri. What's the matter Kamal? - Dad, nothing. - Come on, I'll leave you. Someone tell me why it hurts where the heart is. - Why, Madhav. You look so happy today. - Yes. - what is the matter? - No problem. - What... what did you hide? - nothing. let me see. Give it. Look, what a beautiful picture. The pictures of the princes are like this. The light of my life, Gayathri - Kamal? Who is the light of Kamal's life, Gayathri? Sir, I asked Mr. Podi for a picture. I did not tell Sir to write anything. You are trying to deceive me. Tell me who this Gayathri is. That's not me. Sir. Tell me, or I will beat you. I'm really confused, sir. If I do not, you will not leave me. But if I do so, Mr. Kamal will shoot and kill me. I'm dying on both sides, sir. - Madhav, quietly ignite this fire. Tell me about this. - Yes, sir. I will say sir. There were some rumors circulating between Sir, Kamal and her. It's been a while since Narayan's daughter Gayathri. Yes, sir. But now those mouths have stopped, sir. Stopped... why is that? Two days ago at the temple, on top of the hill... Before God, Kamal accepted Gayathri as his bride. What did you say, Kamal is married... ... without asking me? Hold the flute, I adore you! Let the mountains of sorrow fall on me! But do not let him hurt. God give me the strength to keep the secret of my marriage. Until when? You...? Why is that? Are you scared of me? Where was this fear when my son got married. Near the dead at night? Do you know all this? I know everything. And I know that the world does not know this secret. Gayathri, you have to forget Kamal. I have to forget him... What am I hearing? I have to forget him. How could this be? God. I have committed no sin. By the grace of God I found a place at his feet. But first you need to think about whether you are suitable. You do not deserve that place. I did not deserve it. But the driver said he would treat me like gold. Do not care about me, but at least care about your son. I care more about his mother who gave birth to him than my son. Promised to Kamal's mother at the time of death. That I will marry Kamal to a good family. Then, future generations will be proud of it. To fulfill a vow made to a dead soul... ... are you going to kill the two you started in life? Gayathri, to this day no one has dared me like this. To speak loudly and to look at me. I am the landlord of this area. You are the daughter of a farmer who had nothing. When he comes out of prison. Would you like to be my niece and put me down? Why do people point fingers at me in front of the world? I thought so too, do not dare to look at the sun. But your son taught me that God created... ... that they are human beings, not poor or rich. These are just the things that tell the story. He comes to his senses only after he has cooled down from the fire of your youth. Someday when you have a baby... ... can't marry him into a good family. Then even Kamal regrets... ... about the mistake he made. Then he will start to hate you. The world blames you. Then you will understand too. Love is only a worldliness. And your dad still doesn't know about this. If he knew his philanthropist did this to you... ... that humble man commits suicide out of shame. Then poison me with your own hands. But I can not forget him. Poison...? I can kill you with my own hands if I want to. But I'm not a devil, I'm a human being, I'm helpless too. The rules of society are like swords. They will never forgive those who want to be removed from society. But especially the so-called leaders of the society are forgiven. Gayathri, I beg you... ... to protect my reputation. What do you think, Gayathri? If you do not stop. I have no choice but to commit suicide. "Gayathri, the landlord is not just our master" "He is like our God." "Does anyone betray his God?" "Would you like to take my master's life?" No... no. "You are the cause of my father's death" "My reputation in the eyes of the community has been tarnished by your marriage." "I do not know when I married you." "I will give my life for my self-respect" "I wish you were not born into my family." "A child is expected to bring honor to his parents" "Not to bring shame" "If you do not move" "I have no choice but to commit suicide" "I'm from a good family, but people think I'm unworthy." "Nobody likes to associate with me" "If you had not come into my life, this would not have happened" "Gayathri you destroyed me. You destroyed me" Sir, nothing will happen to you. I will forget that I am his wife. I swear to God. After today I will not tell anyone to hear, that it is your niece. But when Kamal comes back you will forget all this. You will tell him... ... that I did this at my insistence. This promise of yours will fall like a straw from the storm of love. If you still can not believe... ... I promise my husband's life... ... there is no hindrance to your son's life. I have been silent all my life. Gayathri, you have given me my honor, child. Tell me what you want. Price... Price for something like this! Can't pay, even God can't pay it. Sir, if you would like to give me something... ... bless my head... ... like father-in-law blessing his daughter-in-law. My child, God protect you. - Gayathri. Gayathri. - Yes, Dad? Looks like you changed. What's wrong with my baby? Nothing, Dad. I once discussed you. - For marriage with the landlord. - With the landlord? Yes. Do you know what he said? He said that children today are more sensitive than their parents. - When did you meet the landlord? - A few months ago. Why is that? If you have an idea about marriage in your mind... ... tell me, baby. I know there is something bothering you. It will be known anyway. What happened to Gayathri? Brother Narayan, come here. Why this? What has happened to my child? Nothing to worry about, brother Narayan. - You're going to be a grandfather. - What nonsense? Why are you fighting with me? Ask your daughter because she is unmarried. - Where did she get this gift? - Keep quiet. Gayathri, what am I hearing? Get up. If you want to die, go home and do it. She fainted. This is being talked about in every household in the village. People say that she brought these sins from the city. Madhav, don't you dare talk about this. Yes, I will not tell anyone. But sir, the reputation of poor Narayan is now tarnished. Why did you not die when you were born? father! Gayathri I never dreamed you were like this... ... that my face was muddy. What were my expectations? To make you aware and to marry into a good family. It's all over. A child is expected to bring honor to his parents. Not to bring shame. I wish you had poisoned me and killed me. - father! - Your father is dead. Tell me this first. Who is this sinner who stole my happiness? Who harmed my reputation? tell me. Why don't you tell me? Why are you silent? Won't you tell me? I went to jail once for doing nothing. This time I'm going to jail for cutting my daughter's neck. What are you doing here? Sir, I'm a beggar. I'm doomed, sir. Be patient Narayan. I have heard it all. Sir, the poor have no wealth, but... ... he only has respect. Today it is dirty too. Now end my sorrow with your own hands. Don't get angry Narayan. Get up. What should have happened has already happened. Sir, more is happening... ... she refuses to say his name. If he tells me his name once, I will tell him, his father and... ... his whole family, like a rooster... Narayan. Sir, you ask her, maybe she will tell you his name. Dad has no respect. I hope you... This is a noble man, sir. Not going to another house. But come here. Tell him his name. He will use his influence to make this marriage happen. The gentleman does it. Why not talk? Narayan, calm down. Come here. I know you can not stand this shock. Now there is only one thing to do. Give me any help I can. You take Gayathri and leave this village. Gentlemen, I am ready to leave this world. What do you mean, Narayan? Kids make mistakes. So now try to get somewhere out of here. Take care of her. She should have no problems. Do you understand Mom... Mom! What is the fate of you who came to this evil world? You will not live in peace and will not allow your mother to live in peace. You are the living symbol of sin. You are the living symbol of sin. No one is visible. You always look like an idiot. People leaving children... ... looking forward to meeting us? - Come on, let's go inside. - Come on. father. Where is my baby dad? He's dead, baby. No, no. Gayathri, I will see you tomorrow at this time. I want to tell you beautiful stories from abroad. You will laugh a lot. Until tears came to those eyes. Dad, is the baby dead? Yes, my child. Did you bury it in the ground? Yes. You dug deep into the earth, didn't you? Yes, my child. You did well. My son is in the depths of the earth. Can't say harsh words in a cruel world now... ... reach for his ears. He was such a good boy, he hid himself. Because of my mother's sins, I was born and went away. Enough, Gayathri has. Why are you crying, Dad? If he were alive we would have to cry. People laugh when a baby is born. We should laugh at his death, Dad. We should laugh at his death. Laugh, celebrate. I thought the problem would not be solved in two or three years. - You solved it in a year. - Yes. You could have stayed a few more days. As soon as it was over I came back. Okay, come on. The agent wrote... Dad, I'm so tired right now. I would like some rest. - Yes, have something to eat and drink and get some rest. - Come with me. - Madhava. - Yes. Sir, is it for me? Sir, what is this? This is a necklace. I brought it for Nona. That's beautiful, isn't it? Madhava, why are you quiet, Gayathri well? - Did you tell her about my arrival? - How can I tell her? Why is that? Isn't she here? It would be nice if she was not in this world. Madhava, what are you saying? Mr., she was about to give birth. It was rumored throughout the village that she had an affair with someone. Madhav. Kill me if you want, but that's true. Because of this she left the village. Sir, if she said your name, the family honor would be over. No, my Gayathri cannot be like this. This is all a lie. tell me. Where is she Sir, I have heard that she is in Ramnagar. Sir, someone had left this child here on a stormy night. From then on the baby cries constantly. It's amazing he's quiet when you see him. Sir, I have heard the people of Ramnagar say... ... that Mr. Narang was here. With his daughter Gayathri a few days ago. Gayathri gave birth to a fatherless child. Then the child died. Sir, why are you worried about them? forget it. "Someone tell me why the pain is where the heart is" "What happened to the moon?" "What happened to the moon?" "Never laughed like this before." "It's a random encounter on the train. This is enough." Where r u Come and tell me the truth. "The baby she gave birth to is yours. Why did you do that?" "Can't she tell the world, why?" "If she's chaste, why did she not wait for you?" "Why did she run away? She changed your life." "Now look, the whole world is laughing at you." all right. I'm sure we'll meet someday. Daughter, get down carefully. It's all God's game. He takes us wherever He wills. Mr. Ram will at least give me a job as a gardener. His address is on the alert, isn't it? - Yes, Dad. - Come on. - Kamal. - Yes, Dad. - Even if you come back from Singapore... ... you were not at home. I look after you all the time. - Son, what's the difference? - Nothing, Dad. Listen Kamal. You know about the Ramnagar contractor. He is my friend. You marry his daughter. I like that. marriage... - Is getting married the biggest thing? - Kamal? I see marriage as a fraud and women as cheaters. I do not want any cheaters in my life. Kamal, son of Kamal! God, this tree is big. In the same way, my grandson must have grown up. Get off the ball carefully. Mercy is another name for God. We should always feel sorry for the poor. Shyam we are poor, then how... ... do we feel sorry for others? There are probably poorer people in the world than we are. Shyam we play. Why hang out with this Cora every day. Bahadur, to those who insult by saying kora... ... God punishes. In what book is all this written? One day God told me in a dream. But Daddy told me... ... to tell Cora that name. Fool, get out of here! - Your father is an idiot. - You called my father an idiot, didn't you? Now only one of your legs is broken. I break the other leg too. Bahadur, do not hit the ball. He is an orphan. We should feel sorry for the orphans. Do not try to teach me a lesson. You called my dad an idiot. Bola, are you injured? Get up, get up. Bahadur, is it brave to attack a disabled person? - You're a bad boy. - I'm not bad, you are. - Even your mother is a bad woman. - Bahadur, what do you mean? When you need... - If you insult my mother... - Really? Do you love your mother so much? If she's a good girl... ... will she drop you off at an orphanage on a stormy night? Did you see me leaving my mother here? - My father saw it. - Then why did he take me to my mother... -... not returned? - How do I know... ... go and ask Dad. I know everything you said was wrong. Why is mom leaving me here? I'm sure someone stole me and brought me here. I'm sure my mom is a good woman. If she's so good, why does she not come to see you here? He must have thought I was dead. Who knows. Poor thing she's dead. She is not poor. She is a bad woman. A very bad woman. Don't you dare call my mom a bad girl. She is a bad woman. A very bad woman. - do not say that. - I say that. Give up. Stop the fight. do not say that. Child, it is very bad to quarrel with someone. Is it right to insult someone's mother? Tell me, Grandpa. You called me Grandpa. My child. Your story is so sweet. - Baby, what's your name? - My name is Shyam. Shyam... This name was given by the guardian of orphans. - It does not belong to an orphan. - Grandpa, you... ... are you crying or did you feel sorry for me? Yes, you are a perfect example of compassion. Look, I'll give you sweets. Not just sweets. There's a toffee. Bola, you get one, I'll get one. - Get a grandfather. - No, baby, you take mine too. No, Grandpa. Everything has to be shared and eaten. When I say 1, 2, 3 the toffee should be in the mouth. 1,2,3 OK. Grandpa, the school bell rang. we are going. Bola take this. You come in slowly. - Welcome! - Welcome! By your grace my grandson is well. God, you have seven grandchildren. Sir, today is my grandson's haircut festival. - Please help me. - You even have a grandson. - Madhav. - Yes sir. - Tell the manager to give him a hundred rupees. - Thank you very much sir. The poor man has no money to eat. But borrow or celebrate. I have a lot. Despite having money, my son does not even want to get married. Why don't you go to town and talk to him, sir? I went a few times but he would not listen to me. Children make mistakes. Adults, they need to be made aware. That Mr. Kamal is stubborn... -... we must not stop trying. - Okay, I'll try again. - Do you study in college? - No, I'm a teacher. - Which school? - I'm a tutor. - What is this book? Would you show me, please? - The name of the book is "Words". It's a beautiful book. I have no free time... ... read books because of homework. If you have children like this... ... who likes to read books? the ticket. Mr. Do you sell tickets? Give me one ticket to hell. - I'll give you anything you need. - Like you're drinking too much? I'm a train ticket checker. - Show me your ticket. - Train tickets... Here. You have a first class ticket. Why travel in third class, are you crazy? I was not crazy. Made me crazy. She took a third-class ticket and boarded first-class. By that mistake, she went to see me. Does God know where she is? Now I bought a first class ticket... ... traveling in third class to find her. Everyone calls me crazy. Look, this is the memory of our first meeting. You're crazy and drunk. Don't you know it's wrong for Beela to travel here? The next station is nearby. Please go down. Get down, Mister. Where am I, where am I going? I can not think of it. I can not think of it. Sister, did you forget your book? Good thing you reminded me. - Give it up. Get out of here. - Mother! Bola, what happened? Get up. I told you, I'm going to bathe you. Why did you come alone? Shyam, you have a lot of other work to do around the orphanage. - Don't worry about me. - I'm glad to help you. You and I are orphans. One orphan needs to help another. Come on. Sit down. Hello Sita-Ram. Hello Krishna. Hello Sita-Ram. Hello Krishna. Hello Sita-Ram. Hello Krishna. Hello Sita-Ram. Hello Krishna. Not all glitter is gold. Shiny silk dresses do not make a person beautiful. True beauty lies in the purity of the soul. Good with good thoughts... ... Those with a character are immortal. Like Sita, Savithri, Damayanthi. Teacher, how do we test someone's character? Why are you misleading this kid? Teach her a little English. Tell her useful things. Things that are appropriate to navigate in society when she grows up. She does not want to learn about the character and starve to death. - My friend, sit down. - Who? - Where did you bring me with this? - My friend at this place... ... will heal the restlessness in your heart. Menaka Nona about this friend... -... I told you. - Yes sir. What do you like? Tea, coffee, cocoa or an oval drink? What are these things you are talking about? Tea and coffee have ruined his health. I came here because I was afraid of the world. Let him swim in your eyes and let him swim in the lake of your sweet voice. - Mr. Kamal, you stay. I will come. - You... What is this big night music for? Is there a party? One party every morning. In the evening it becomes Deepavali. Did your anxiety subside? - Grapes...? - Yes, they are sour. A touch that lightens my heart. Only Gayathri's pet. So why did you come here? You had to go to Haridwar. I came here not of my own free will. I was brought here. My drink brought me to this hell. Looks like this is your first time. Come with me. Go! I say get away from me. Gayathri...? My Gayathri...? Gayathri you. Are you in a place like this? No... no. I work here. In this hell? Gayathri, is what the villagers say true? Is that true? Why don't you say anything? Not really illegal .. If you are pure, speak the truth. Tell me why do people talk bad about you? What happened after I left? Tell me the truth. Gayathri, if you talk I can regain my happiness. My life is worse than death. Worth living again. Why are you silent? Why do not you say that all this is not true? No, I can not say that. I can not say that. If God is blind I can say nothing. If a convict cannot plead guilty. He then seeks refuge in the name of God. Are you in this house now...? Now I do not want to know anything else. Seems true. It's right in front of my eyes. Never believe the truth with your eyes. Try to forget what the truth is. Go home and obey your father's will. Get back on track with life. Drinking will ruin your life. Life is about pleasing others. You teach me the lesson of life. Get yourself off the track... ... teach me a lesson? You are the cause of my destruction. If I had not met you on the train, I would never have met you. You fell into the trap of your dishonest love. For years I have regarded you as an image of holiness. Your memory is close to my heart. The world tried to make me understand... ... that you are a despicable sinner. But I did not trust anyone. Today I realized the world... ... OK I was wrong. Gayathri. - What's the matter, baby? - Nothing, Dad. Dad, I do not want to be here. Let's go somewhere else. If we have to leave, why don't we go to Ramnagar? I have heard that the school needs a teacher there. If you work, your mind will relax too. Dad, let's go somewhere. I need to get out of here. OK baby. Let's go. Bola take this medicine. Shyam why are you so late? The amount given was not enough... ... for the doctor's fee. I touched his feet and begged him to understand. Then I was given medicine. Shyam, you help me a lot. Why should I not? You are my friend. Bola, give me a smile. I'm going to school now. Otherwise I would not be able to focus on school. Okay, Bola. Dad, I got the job. I teach second grade. I'm going inside. Now you go home. My dear Shyam. You're the uncle who gave me the toffee. - You recognized me. - Who can forget Uncle Toffee? Did you come to school too? Child, what can an older person like me learn? Why hasn't it been so long? I could not come because it was busy. But from now on I come every day, right? You are very good. The bell rang. If I do not want to go I will be late. Son Shyam, tell me, what class are you in? - 2nd class. - 2nd class...? From today you will get a new teacher. She is so beautiful. - She will love you like a mother. - Is she that good? - Okay, I'll go and see him. Welcome. - Welcome. Dear children, the greatest thing in the world is cleanliness. We should always wear clean clothes to school. I do not like... ... for those who are not paying attention in class and are late for school. Teacher! - Who are you? - Teacher, I'm Shyam. I am studying in this class. You are my teacher, aren't you? I have heard that you are very beautiful. Wait. Why are you entering without my permission? May I not come in, teacher? Why not comb your hair? - Is there no oil in the house? - No, teacher. Go to your bench and stand on it. The world is divided into water and land in a 3: 1 ratio. People, there are different races. Of the land animals, the big ones are. Elephants and lions. Cows... Small animals are rabbits, chickens and so on. There are many other animals besides this. Snakes crawl on the ground like scorpions. Many insects, such as ants and cockroaches. Cockroaches. Cockroaches. Shyam, what happened? Come here. - Why did you scream? - Teacher, Bahadur... ... put a cockroach on my feet. I was scared. - Sir, he's lying. - Sir, check his pocket. There is a cockroach in it. Bahadur, show me your pocket. Sir, I have no cockroaches. Shyam, show me your pocket now. You are lying. Give me your hand. Mother! - Are you not afraid of being attacked? - No. - I'm not afraid of anything. - Why is that? I was born an orphan. I live in an orphanage. If I start to get scared of these things. Who is there to protect me? I did not know you were an orphan. - Sir. - Yes, Madhav. Your face is shining today. But that day when I came to town to pick you up with your dad. I was shocked to see the situation you were in. Madhav, you brought my body back. But my heart is elsewhere. Sir this heart really hurts a lot. There is only one cure for it. That is, the loss of a heart. Now I have learned to say such things. "You are our mother, you are our father" "You are our brother and you are our friend" - Shyam, what are you looking at? - Photo of my mom and dad. That is Lord Krishna. You are very lucky. To have such parents. - Did you have your lunch? - No, teacher. Here we get food only twice. Morning and evening. Feeling hungry during the day? If I feel hungry I drink water and I lose my hunger. - There's some food. Do you like to eat? - No, teacher. - Get some. - do not. No matter what happens, a good person always does the right thing. A lion is hungry but does not eat grass. Even if a sandalwood tree burns... ... gives off a sweet smell. Shyam you are hungry aren't you? Come with me. - Why is that? - Teacher, you can feed me today. Who is there to feed me tomorrow? - You can eat with me every day. - Really? - Yes. Sit down. I will eat with you on one condition. When I grow up and start working I think I will compensate you. That's a good deal. Then I'm getting old. I will lose my arms and legs. That would be a good help to me. Shyam, would you like to stay in an orphanage? Teacher, I do not like it. But I have no choice. I heard as a child my... ... Mom left me there. Shyam, are you at my house with me? I'm not hitting you. I'm not afraid to fight but I can not stay at your house. - Why is that? - I have a lame friend at the orphanage... ... called Bola. If I come to live with you... ... will there be a friend to help him? He can't even bathe alone. What a wonderful child you are. Actually your mom's... ... heartless, enough to leave a child of God like you in an orphanage. Teacher, do not tell my mother anything. - I'm angry. - All right. Eat something now. Take. - Teacher, eat yourself. - Yes. Teacher, wait. When I count 1, 2, 3, you eat fast. Your food. 1,2,3 ready. - Teacher, eat your food. - Yes baby, I will eat. You eat first. Kamal, life is not just about living for us. We too must live for others. Until you get it... ... there will be no peace in my life or in yours. May Nirvana heal the soul of the departed mother. Dad, I tried to live my life the way I wanted to. But there was no consolation. Now I will do what you like. Kamal, I'm happy. I'm so happy. - But Dad, don't force me to get married soon. - all right. I will arrange your marriage when you wish. - Hello, sir. - Hello, sit down. Thank you. Son, how do you feel now? - I feel better than before. - That's good news. - My work will be done. - work? - Yes. The school in Ramnagar is scheduled to hold their annual function. - I wanted to make Mr. Kamal the chief guest at the event. - All right. But this is something that belongs to adults. - You invite Dad. - It was your dad's turn last year. This year it is your turn. You maintain your accounts very well. Kamal, you have to agree to this. Changing your routine will be good for your health. - Your father is right. - Shall I agree for you? - Your choice, Dad. - All right then. I'm sure I left home today in a happy moment. - Mr. Kamal, hello. - Please come. - Bola. - Yes. You have a fever. How do you get to school to see a play? Shyam, then I will be fine. What is your role in the play? I'm going to be an orphan rabbit in the play. Are you an orphan in the play? Yes, Bola. That lion is the mother of the rabbit, because it kills and eats. What happens next? Rabbit, revenge... -... against the lion. It is me. - How is that? Shyam Do not be afraid. Do well. Do not worry, teacher. The landlord's son will be happy. He will give you a good position. Shyam, do well. I know about you. Grandpa, don't worry about me. - Drag the screen exactly. - All right. - Come on, put this on. "My boyfriend is not here, what can I do?" "My sweetheart has not come" "If anyone calls me crazy" "Let him say whatever he wants." "I'm starving to death, what can I do?" "If anyone calls me crazy" "My dear mother. I played with your hand when I was little." "Mom, my dear mom" "Don't worry so much, you're a poor kid" "Think wisely and take revenge on the lion" "May such an injustice never happen again." "I want to say thank you to all of you." "Something for you all" "I hate the lion, I do not want to endure his torture anymore." "I'm grateful to you all." - You should not say such things. - Why is that? "The king of that forest can devour you" - Now I have to go alone. - Why is that? "Because of a coward who endures that injustice." "Little boy, listen to us" "Little boy, listen to us" If your life is worth living, stop being stubborn. "Little boy, listen to us" "You have a mustache and are very strong" "You're one in a million" "You have a mustache and are very strong" "Very good" "But there are two lions living here." "One in the jungle, the other in the water." "Two lions live here." "Come, Mr. Lion, see who is here." "Come, Mr. Lion, see who is here." "Come face to face, traitor. Why are you hiding?" "Fight with me if you are brave" "I have control over this forest" "Look, this little guy's adventure, he did a real trick." "No one has ever seen such a beautiful magician." "Look, this little guy's adventure, he did a real trick." "No one has ever seen such a beautiful magician." "Look, this little guy's adventure, he did a real trick." "No one has ever seen such a beautiful magician." You played very well. - Baby, what's your name? - Sir, my name is Shyam. - I'm in the orphanage. - is it? I did not know. That a child as talented as you is staying in an orphanage. Please come. We would love to show you our school. Mr. Kamal, this is our new teacher Mrs. Gayathri. She was the one who coached this show. Do you employ such women as teachers here? Principal, why are you... ... such a person is responsible for the future of the children. For someone who does not have this good character. If I had known about this before... ... I'm not coming here. Ma'am, get her out of this job right away. Mrs. Gayathri, you were dismissed. Gayathri. Dad, what happened? Someone help me. Nothing to worry about. His head is injured. His age causes him to have high blood pressure. He will soon regain consciousness. He needs a complete rest. - Yes. - Take care of him. - I'm going to the contractor's bungalow. - All right, sir. The fever has increased. Bola, open your eyes. What do I do now? Sir, Bola has a high fever. - Talk to a doctor. - forget it. Let that cripple die. If the doctor does not come, he will die. He will die. But why would you die for him? - go to sleep. - No. I'll go and talk to the doctor. - Stop! I'll teach you a lesson. - Leave me alone. - You're going to the doctor, aren't you? - Leave me alone. Sir, open the door, open the door. Mother! Are you trying to escape? You are already used to breaking down doors at this age. Never come to the orphanage again. Get out of here. - Doctor! - why? I came from an orphanage. My friend, Bola is very sick. He needs treatment from a doctor. But the doctor is not here. He went to the contractor's bungalow. You can go there if you want. - To the contractor's bungalow? - Yes. Daughter, I did you an injustice. - I hid something from you. - What is it? Please forgive me. Dad, tell me, what is it? - Your child. - My child...? - He was not dead. - Aren't you dead? - Is he or she alive? - Yes. Dad, are you telling the truth? Yes, I lied to you. - Where is my baby now? - At the orphanage. - Who is my child? - Shyam. Is Shyam my child? - Yes. - Shyam. Daughter, you go to the orphanage. Get him quickly. - Who, why is this? - Please talk to Shyam. - He's not here. - Where did he go? How do I know? He escaped from here. He is not like that. I have not looked at his horoscope. If you want to find him, do so. He may be begging on the streets now. Shyam... Shyam! Please eat. - Please. - No. No, thank you. Daughter Rajni, play the tambourine now. Since my son-in-law came for the first time we definitely listened to some music. Mr. Kamal, I'm sorry to hear that. - You son-in-law before marriage. - It's okay. But she does not want to be bothered. - Dad is waiting for me. - There is nothing wrong with that. just a moment. Daughter, you start. - Doctor... Doctor! - why? My friend, Bola, is very sick at the orphanage. Please come with me. - Or he will die. - Who is this? News of death at such a good time? Son you go. I can not come with you now. Landlord, please tell the doctor to come with me. - Ask him to save my friend. - Who took him in? Mr. Landlord, you are like a father to us. Please fulfill the child's wishes. Shyam, don't worry. Doc will definitely come with you. Doctor, let's go. I will come with you. Come on, Shyam, let's go. Dad, he doesn't care about us. But he cares about this boy. Don't worry daughter. Let me show you who I am. father! Where is Shyam and why did you not come with him? He escaped from the orphanage. - I wonder. Where did he go? - Escaped...? God punishes me for my bad deeds. I had separated him from his mother. Dad, I'll never find my Shyam. Baby, don't cry. God will not be so harsh with us. - Doctor, how is the baby? - I can't say anything right now. Is this how orphans are cared for? Who is responsible if something happens? - Sir, I do. - Shut up. Doctor, you must have given Bola a good cure. But please do not leave until he is well. No, I'm not going anywhere. Bola, the landlord himself gave you the doctor. Shyam Why did you bother him? Again I will not bother anyone. I am going to God. I'll tell him to send you mom and dad. Why say such things? I do not want a mom and dad. I just want you. No, God is talking to me. Shyam, you sing bhajans every day. - Please sing it for me today. - Bola, how do I sing? Can't you see there are tears in my eyes? Shyam, only once. Are you my friend Please sing for me one last time. - I'll never ask you to sing again. - all right. You are our mother, you are our father. You are our brother, you are our friend. You are our mother, you are our father. You are our brother, you are our friend. Flowers we never bloom. We are the dust at your feet. Flowers we never bloom. We are the dust at your feet. Always keep your loving eyes on us. You are our brother, you are our friend. You are our mother, you are our father. You are our brother, you are our friend. - Bola. - Shyam, your balls are gone now. Bola, wait. Where are you going alone? Take me with you. You ended our friendship. You said you would never be angry with me. Talk, Bola, talk. Shyam, do not cry. I have no mother or father. I only had the ball. Now he has left me alone. Where do I go now? Shyam, I am with you. You are not an orphan. You are not an orphan. I thought there was only selfishness in the world. That there is no love in this world. But seeing your love in this orphanage... ..I learned that life is only giving, not taking. I'm a runaway. But Shyam you have given me a new reason to live. I will always keep you with me. I will never leave you. - Please do not worry. - Shyam. Big bungalow! How many are here? - My father and I. - Really? Sister, brother or grandfather, aren't they? - No, no one. - That means you're an orphan like me. Then what is the need for such a big house? The one who eats less and saves more is a thief. - Did you know that? - Is that so? Have you read this in any book? - No, my heart tells me so. Let's do something. - what? You say 1, 2, 3, then I tell you. Why are you looking like an idiot? Say 1, 2, 3. 1,2,3 OK! Now I will tell you. The orphanage is very small. There are a lot of people out there. Why, not all of those kids get here. You and your father can stay in the orphanage. Amazing! Sir, he is totally like you. Long live you! I'll get you some sweets soon, son. Madhava. Keep quiet. - Kamal, who is this kid? - Dad, this is Shyam. He is an orphan. Shyam, this is my father. - Grandpa, hello. - Grandpa? - Sir, the wish for your grandson has come true. - Madhav. Kamal, where did you come with him? - He calls me Grandpa. - Sir, Grandma can't tell. be quiet. Kamal, go and leave this garbage dump. Dad, kids are not dirty. They are flowers that bloom because of God. Adults make mistakes. The children have to pay for them. The fault lies not with their parents. Even if it's my fault, send him here. No, Dad, he's not going anywhere. He, like my two eyes. He should be here. Kamal are you conscious? Everything you need is done to your liking. If this orphan were here I would not live in this house. Grandpa, the house is yours. Why should you go? - I will go. - No, Shyam. If this child does not have space in this house... ... so I'm leaving here too. Sir, why are father and son fighting for me? I'm going back to my orphanage. - Shyam, I will go with you. Come on. - Kamal... Kamal! Sir, do you not obey your father's command? That is very wrong. Humans at the behest of their parents... .... not only the animals are obedient. Amazing! Such a little boy and such great thoughts. Even the wise will defeat you. Sir, people keep dogs and cats as pets. They grow like beards. Sir, can't you keep this baby here? - Someone like little Kamal. - That's enough. Kamal do as you wish. But you don’t go anywhere. Sir, what is this red drink you drink? Blood? No, Shyam. This is not blood. It is poisonous. Poison...? We should not drink poison. People die from poisoning. Shyam, bring back my glass. If I am your friend, you must listen to me. - Give me back my glass. - No, I will not give up. - Will you give it or not? - No. - Shyam, do not be stubborn. Give me my glass. Why did you throw it away? - Not polite. - Mother! - Not polite. - Mother! You and Mom have to go to hell. He has come to teach me a lesson. I don't care about anyone. Shyam? Shyam. Madhav. - Madhava. - Yes sir. - Where is Shyam? - He's out now. - Went out? - Yes. Shyam. - Shyam... Shyam! - Let me go, sir. - I'm going to the orphanage. - Shyam, I will not leave you. Please leave me. Why bother a poor boy? - Are you so angry with me? - I'm just an orphan. I'm angry but it doesn't make any difference to you. Please forgive me. It was my fault last night. You did not hit me. - So who did? - Am I telling the truth? - You didn't hit me. - So? - That red water you drank, told me to hit. - Shyam. Shyam. You are small but you have a good understanding. For me, I'm ashamed of myself. If I had a son of my own he would not love me that much either. Although you value me more than a son... -... I'm just an orphan. - No Shyam, you... ... not an orphan. You cannot be an orphan. Shyam, you are my son. You are my son. Shyam, are you my son? - Will you really be my dad? - Yes, of course... -... will be your father. - This is very good news. Bola has fulfilled his promise. He called Lord Krishna. Ask me to send a father. I'm not just my son... ... when you grow up I will make you the owner of all my land. Landlord, from today you will have to fulfill... ... Landlord, Shyam Kumarage, Will. If you touch that red water again. Will never be friends again. Then you are not my father either. I am not your son either. No. I will never touch them again. Those who can be happy with their son's love... ... Why use such things? Come on, let's go inside. Why do you always pick him up? Grandpa, who do you think I am? I am the son of Mr. Ratan Kumara, the owner of a large land... ... Shyam Kumar, son of Mr. Kamal Kumar. - Junior Landlord. - all right. - What do you mean, Dad? - Yes, son. Let's go. - Listen, Kamal. Good day next Monday. Can I arrange your wedding with the contractor's daughter? Dad, why are you in such a hurry to get married? When you hear the name marriage, you get nervous. You brought this orphan home. I agreed. As soon as he arrived he started calling me Grandpa. I agreed. I agree with all your wishes. But you will never obey me. Please keep my dignity as a son. Dad, I obey you, right? Now you too must obey your father. He's happy too, and I'm getting a mom too. Please agree, son. At least listen to him. Dad, please agree. Do not be stubborn like children. If you're stubborn, I'm going to the orphanage. - All right, Dad. - Very good. Now you are a good father. - Grandpa, start getting ready for the wedding. - Yes. Sir agreed to something he could never do, surprisingly. This little kid did it in an instant. However, he at least agreed. - Madhava. - Yes. Throw this glass and bottle out. God, how do you do that? Madhava, he is right. Throw them all out. Thank God for this. Disgusting. - Dad, is that a temple? - Yes, son. - It is the temple of Lord Krishna. - God Krishna? - Yes. I'm sure my balls are there. Should I go and see him? Can i go Will you come with me? - Yes, baby. Let's go. - You are the best father. - I came first. - Good. Shyam wins! Shyam go and bow your head and come quickly. You come too, Dad. - No, baby. I can not face Lord Krishna. - Why is that? - He's angry with me. - Why is that? I will make you two friends again. Shyam I know you win God's heart too... ... with your innocent smile. You're my good son, aren't you? Then listen to me. Go and bow and come quickly. - I'll wait for you. - You're so stubborn. - Please go. Sir, after showing a ray of light, why this darkness again? Where is my son? Please let me meet him. God, did Bola come here? How is his leg now? I want to see him. Krishna, why don't you talk? Aren't you talking and your mouth is full of butter? Please speak. Please speak. Bola. "You are our mother, you are our father" "You are our brother, you are our friend" "You are our mother, you are our father" "You are our brother, you are our friend" - Shyam... Shyam! Are you here - Teacher...? Child, do not call me teacher. Call me mom. I am your mother. I am your mother. - Are you my mother? - Yes I am. Call me mom. - Mother. - My child. Bola kept his promise. Krishna told God to send me a mother too. - Shyam, what are you saying? - My friend, Bola, told me. That he would go to Lord Krishna and send me a mother and a father. He sent me a father some time ago. - Your father, who is he? - You do not know? Mr. Kamal Kumara, son of land owner Ratan Kumar. Who told you he was your father? He himself told me. Who else is telling me? He was in the habit of drinking red liquor. I broke his habit, he became my father. Shyam, you stopped his drinking. That means my tears... Do you like him? Does he love you? Mom if he doesn't love me why... ... taking me from the orphanage to his house? Mom she loves me so much. He's going to make me a big landlord. Lord, you have heard my prayers. The Lord even heard Bola's prayers. - But something went wrong. - What is it? - Bola sent me one father and two mothers. - You mean? - Who's second? - The father is the one who is going to get married. Oh my God, is your father getting married? Mom, why are you crying? If Dad doesn't want to get married... ... I will say no. - He will never disobey me. - Shyam. Mom, come on. I will let you meet my father. - Is he here? - Yes, he came with me. He is standing outside. He has a very large house. I'll give you a bigger room too. Come with me. - No, baby. I do not like your father. - Why is that? Did you hit him at school too? No, baby. It's something else. You are still young. I'll tell you when you grow up. Mom, can I be with you or Dad? Shyam, you stay with him. It is your home. Shyam, hurry up baby. Go to Shyam. Your father is talking to you. Go. - Don't tell him I met you. - Why is that? - He will be angry with me. - All right. - I'll be back to see you. - Promise. - Promise. What did Shyam do inside after all this time? - You don't know what I'm doing inside? - No, I'm not. - I saw a lot of things inside. - Really? - Yes. I saw my friend Bola in the statue of the god. Then Bola left. Baby, let's go. It's too late, isn't it? - Dad, take this. - What is it? - It is an offering to God. - It's very tasty. - it is not. You want to feed me with your little hands, right? Yes, it is very tasty. My Shyam, in his hand? God I can dedicate my whole life to a vision like this. I knew Mr. Kamal would never reject you. It's a good thing he agrees. - There's something you have to agree on. - Yes, tell me. Kamal's mother always said he wanted her. To perform the marriage of her child in her own home. Why should I oppose it? You know Rajni doesn't even have a mother. If there were women this could have been argued. This house is like our own home. I will be here a few days before my wedding with Rajni. It's good to have a wedding here. - Or we can salt water in his house... - Madhav. Sir, congratulations on your marriage. Hello, congratulations. Congratulations to me too. This is my father's wedding. Dad, what kind of person are you? Why is your face like this even on your wedding day? OK, do not answer. I'm going to see my new mom. God I married him before you. I promised his father that I would be heartbroken. In front of you. And when you hear this wedding music? Why God, my heart is on fire. Please give me strength. Give me strength. To fulfill my promise. Please give me strength. Mom I never knew my mom was so beautiful. Rajani, congratulations. You have a son. Even before your wedding. Rajani Is this your husband's second marriage? New mom you shine like lightning. Get out of here. What are you here for? I came to my dad getting married... - See if it suits my mother. - what? You are a bad mother. I will not let you marry my father. I go to my teacher mother. Now what is this new question? Who is this teacher? She is a very good mother. If he saw you hitting me... ... he will not keep you. what are you doing here? Who are you to ask that? father! I'm sure there's some secret here. Otherwise how can an orphan get so much freedom. He dares to make fun of people as he pleases. Don't you remember Mr. Kamal the other day... ... went with him without listening to my song. Daughter, do not worry about this. I will tame him. - Come on, get out of here. - Are you trying to control me? You can tie horses with your mustache. Do not try to scare me. Do you know who I am? Who are you I am the son of Mr. Ratan Kumara, the owner of a large land... ... Shyam Kumar, son of Mr. Kamal Kumar. - Future landlord. - Future landlord? - Get out of here. - I'm leaving. Let me tell you what happens to your mustache. Drive fast. Dad, there is a problem here. I think I will be like a housemaid after I get married. Baby, don't worry. Let the marriage happen. It's my job to cheat on them after marriage. - Landlord's property can be taken. - He's not as stupid as you. He's a bit of an idiot. I will take care of the rest. - How dare you... - No, Madhav, no. We have to think logically. Somehow this marriage has to happen. - Where is my teacher mom? - Teacher mom...? - Yes. I went to her house. There she found out she was here. - Gayathri? - Yes. - She went out. - Her father's name is inside. - Inside...? - Yes. The toffee guy. You are here. So, you are the father of my teacher mother. Where is my grandfather, my mother? Your mother? Who told you she was your mother? you do not know anything. Mom said she was my mom. Dad said he was my dad. If parents can't get married... ... What is the use of being their son? Who is your father? My father was the youngest landowner in Wasanthapur. Okay, I'll go now. Tell mom to get ready. I'll send the car. Tell her to come right away. The wedding should take place today. Welcome! Baby, what do you say? Do not cause any problems. Drive fast. Shyam. Shyam, son Shyam. Shyam, wait. My father is not in the room. He went to the bungalow. I tried to stop him. - But he did not listen. He shouted, Shyam. - Shyam. Dear Shyam. No problem. That orphan is friendly with Kamal. When he said anything. You are a wise person. Why are you upset about the baby? Now the auspicious time has passed. Sir, I trust you completely. But if I think I have a doubt in my heart. If you want to clear my doubts... ... I can transfer all your property to my daughter's name. Is this a condition for marriage? All right then. I do not need to keep my property with me when I die. It's the same for Kamal and Rajni. I will write them. I promise. Thank you. If Sir is not in trouble. - Please sign this. - Sign? - Do you not believe my word? - Of course I believe. But it should be satisfied. Contractor, you were the first person I ever met in my life... ... insulted my family's self-esteem. Do you think that I am not keeping my word? Don't you know that I want to die... ... rather than going against a promise. - Who do you think I am? - Grandpa, how are you... ... understands this idiot. That I had a good mom for my dad. Look at this little boy and his courage. Wait, where are you running? - Where are you going? Get out of this house. - father. - father. - The naughty child. - Contractor, leave him. - father. - Shyam. - father. father. - Contractor, leave him. - Get out of here. - Mother. - Shyam, my child. - Mother. Shyam, where are you? Stop it. No sympathy. - Assaulting a child? Whether you are human or not. - Stop. what happened? You. Shyam, what are you doing here? - come to me. - No, Dad. She is my mother. - Mother? - Yes. Gayathri, were you born to block me? At every step of my life? I considered this child to be a support to me... ... to my miserable and empty life. Today you are stealing it. By naming you as his mother. Tell me, what is the proof that you are his mother? There is no evidence for everything in this world. Man has never seen God, but still believes in him. Because there is no answer... ... Do you take God's name for granted? To this day, I live by the grace of God. People always missed me. - Son, let's go. This world is not for us. - Wait. You can not take this child with you. - Mr. Young Landlord. - father. - Shyam is her son. If he was her son, why did he stay in the orphanage? When he was born I left him in an orphanage. I was afraid of what people would say. Prevent me Gayathri from falling into the dark for years... ... I said her son was dead. But a few days ago I told him who Shyam was. Do you know who the father of this child is? No sir, I scolded her many times. But she did not say that. How can she say that? Who openly admits their guilt? Talk. Tell us who the father of this child is. Why are you silent? Why not talk? You know about this kid. Tell us who his father is. No, I can not tell anyone. I'm not saying that. Dad threatened to kill me. But I wanted to die, not open my mouth. The whole world made fun of me but I am still silent. Except for me, the only god in the sky and... ... someone on earth knows who my child's father is. Save his honor... ... I made my life a living hell. This secret will always be in my life. Even if I die, I will never reveal this secret. Dad, let's go. Senior, I do not bother you anymore. Please do not yell at the inferior landlord. Shyam... Shyam! We will end this question here. The wedding auspicious time is dawning. What marriage? A marriage does not happen. - What do you mean? - I have a lot to say. Today I learned the meaning of life. I thought honor meant money, property... ... and called false pride. But today I learned what a clear conscience is. More than all the wealth in the world. The oath is worth a lot. I am rich. People respect me. But today I learned about a clean conscience because of my money I have no respect here. All those honors should go to Mrs. Gayathri. She kept her promise as a mother raises her child. Mrs. Gayathri is my niece. Shyam is Kamal's son. He is the light of my house. - Dad, what are you saying? - I'm telling the truth, son. I'm telling the truth. I am guilty. Save my family's false pride... ... I forced Gayathri to give me a promise. She succumbed to my pressure. She was hiding the truth. Excuse me daughter. - Sir. - Narayan, don't call me sir. Call me your cousin. If you intend to make employees your relatives... ... so why did you insult us to come? Do you think I will be silent? I will destroy them all. Daughter, let's get out of here. - Contractor, do not forget to take your stick. - Get out of here! Gayathri I suspect you have committed a grave sin. - I'm so disgusted. - do not say that. There is nothing wrong with either of these. What are you two talking about? No one talks to me. Tell me aren't you my parents? Yes baby. We are your parents. daughter in law. You really belong in our house. Get home for this auspicious time. Come on. No, first I will say 1, 2, 3. Then set foot in the house. Get ready. 1, 2, 3. Come on.
