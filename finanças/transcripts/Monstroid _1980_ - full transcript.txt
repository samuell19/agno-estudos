Now, if the plant stops working, the village stops living. But more important to us, if one of our big plants stops operating, we lose money-- lots of money. Oh, that's a shot of Pete. I think you met him in Peru. He runs the plant. Next slide, honey. Now, Bill, this is a slide of Maria Reyes the year her husband was killed.

Now, there's a group of people who think she's a witch. Please, Al-- Mr. Barnes. (sighs) All right, Miss Torres, next slide. Now, this is where I think our trouble is. This is Victor Sanchez. He's been raising hell all over South America with his anti-American and anti-big-business bullshit. Now, I think he is our problem. He's been spreading stories about the witch and the monster, stirring up the natives to get them to get us out the country. Now, you and I don't believe in that monster crap, but Sanchez sure as hell is using it. Now every animal that's dead, every person that's missing is killed by some monster, according to Sanchez. Now, he's scared a lot of people out of town, and the production at the plant has slowed down. And I want to know what's happening, what's causing it, and I want it stopped. That's why I'm sending you to Columbia. Put on the next goddamn slide. Now, if we ain't got enough with Sanchez, we gotta put up with this bitch. Now, she's been filming and recording all our problems for a network that we advertise with to the tune of over $4 million every year, and we can't stop them. ♪♪ This is Patty Clark coming to you from the small, lakeside town of Chumayo, Columbia.

Chumayo has its problems, and there is the problem, or at least one of them- the Durado cement plant, operated by an American corporation, and discharging its raw waste directly into Lake Chumayo. The fishermen have put away their nets. Pollution has taken away their livelihood. And that pollution comes from that cement plant.

Oh, come on, Pete, don't be ridiculous. Monsters in the lake? That's all we need. Look, isn't it just possible that all this is aimed at shutting the plant down? That's what Sam keeps harping on-- radicals. What can you tell me about this Victor Sanchez character? Folk hero or radical, depending on which side of the pollution line you're sitting on. What the hell's that got to do with Laura? Pete, if I knew the answers, I wouldn't ask the questions. Too late. They're coming back. Oh, Pete, tell me, is it true about Laura? What happened? Well, I don't know what you kids heard, buy...she's dead. The doc's trying to find out what killed her. What happened? Oh, Pete! We don't know, son. Oh, I'm sorry, kids. This is Bill Travis, from the home office. Bill, this is the Anderson kids-- Andrea and Glen. Andrea, Glen. Hi. I can't believe anyone would want to hurt Laura. It just doesn't make any sense. We were just saying the same thing, son. We can't believe it either. There's talk it was some kind of an animal. Maybe a shark. Shark? In a lake? Well, that's what your father thought? That, or-- I don't know about shark, but there's one thing for sure. There's something in that lake. Yeah, mostly dead fish. What I saw wasn't dead. I don't know what it was, but I know it wasn't dead. When was that, Glen? Well, last year sometime. I saw this thing. It came up out of the water. But it was across the lake. I couldn't get a good look at it. But I know I saw it. Then just yesterday, there were some big ripples. Something was swimming under the water. Oh, yeah? What did it look like? Well, it was like-- like the back of some animal. Like the back of a really big elephant. I don't know what it was, but I know I saw it. Glen, how many times does daddy have to tell you? You don't believe me, do you? Son, it's kind of hard to believe stories about sharks and monsters and elephants in lakes. Daddy's gonna kill him if he doesn't stop telling these monster stories. Maybe it wasn't a story. A jar of your American know-how, mister? Oh, Mr. Sanchez. Oh, you know of me? I am flattered, senor. Don't be. Glad you showed up. Now I don't have to go around the countryside chasing after you. I also know why you're here. There's a few things I want you to know. First of all, I don't want to catch you disrupting the production of this plant or using the people in this town. And if I find you in any way responsible for the death of the girl last night... I'm gonna kick your ass. I understand perfectly, mister. But there are a few things I also know, amigo. I know who you are, and why you are here in my country. I know what the rich Americans have done to our land. You ruin our waters and our air with your filth. You corrupt our people with your money. And now, mister, there is something I want you to know. I have gone long and hard to rid my country of foreign vermin. And I will continue to do so. In the end, mister, we shall see who kicks who in the ass. (priest) Black magic has existed for centuries. It is my small flock of innocent believers that I must protect. It is up to Mother Church to watch over and tend the needs of these uninformed people and lead them out of temptation. This temptation, Father-- Exactly what are you referring to? Sinful ways, my child. Satan narrows us down twisted paths so that he may gain his evil ends. He beckons us with monetary gains to ruin God's beautiful skies. To pollute His pure waters. He has planted an emissary among us-- a black angel to do his bidding. To call evil creatures from the depths. To kill innocent victims. To mutilate their physical being, and to devour their souls. (indistinct murmuring) (Clark) Thank you, Father. And now, for another point of view about the mysterious happenings in this usually peaceful town. This is Ann Anderson and her charming daughter Andres. Ann, you're the wife of the cement plant supervisor aren't you? I--I-- Why, yes, I am. You knew Laura Manley, the woman they found this morning, quite well, didn't you? Yes, I did. She was my husband's secretary and a very good friend. I understand there was a similar incident some years back. Uh, yes. A man, Jose Reyes, was murdered in a similar way. It was horrible. His wife never recovered from the shock. The people here think she's...odd. even possessed. Possessed? Oh, you know how they are down here-- easily influenced, superstitious. They call her bruja-- the witch. (Clark) The witch? Yes. Some say she can even conjure up demons. Oh, it's ridiculous, but you know how backward these people are. Ann, they talk about the lake. About it not only being polluted, but harboring evil spirits. Can you tell me anything about that? That's nonsense. Local superstition. Oh, there's been gossip from the locals about a creature or a monster of some sort, but they blame it on the Reyes woman. It's pure absurdity. People have sworn they've seen all kinds of things Wait a minute. But you know what I think? I think probably-- And you end there! You shut that damn thing off before I break it to bits! I thought I told you there was to be no interviews. Shut it down, Bob. Senorita, I am ashamed of you. You do harm to your profession. We have enough problems in our town without you stirring up the people. I am seriously thinking of asking you to leave Chumayo before you do us more harm. And I want that tape. Who the hell do you think you are? (telephone ringing) (Rita) Durado Cement, Mr. Barnes' office. Mr. Travis from Columbia? Yes, we'll accept the call. Mr. Travis? Well, how are you and the Columbians getting along? (Travis) Oh, just fine. Great assignment. Loads of fun and games. Have you seduced everything in skirts down there yet? Well, between killings, mysterious disappearances, panic in the streets, a legendary monster, and a big-mouth reporter, I managed to squeeze in some hand-holding. I'm sure that when things level off, you'll make up for lost time. And the legendary monster who's been eating all the people will have nothing on you once you get started. Now that you got that out of your system, let me speak to Barnes. (intercom buzzer buzzes) Mr. Barnes, Mr. Travis calling from Chumayo, Columbia, collect. Hey, Bill, what's up down there? She what? Why the hell didn't you kick her fuckin' ass out of Chumayo? Use your charm. Get on her good side. You'll think of something to do. Oh, Christ. All right, I'll-- I'll call her boss in New York and tell him she's contracted malaria or something, he's gotta get her home right away. Hey, I said I'd try. You what? You wanna what? What the fuck's a "sonar"? In the lake? Hey, hey, you're not starting to believe that monster crap too, are you? Okay, okay, okay. I'll get Rita to locate one someplace. Hey, I think there's one in the plant in Peru. Yes, Bill, I'll check it. And, yes, right away. Okay, pal, so long. Jeez. (buzzer buzzes) Uh, Rita, I want you to check in South America for a sonar unit. We may have one in our plant in Miraflores. Uh, get that fuckin' thing and whatever goes with it to Travis as fast as you can. (telephone ringing) Okay? (Rita) It's Mr. Strone, from the network in New York. Huh. Hmm. Phil, I, uh-- Believe it or not, I was just gonna call you. I-- She did? I don't give a god damn what she told you. I'm gonna tell you something. I want her ass out of there today.

Read your fuckin' contract... asshole! (Travis) The pollution problem we'll have solved very soon, but now this thing about the superstition, I don't know what to do about it. (Montero) Ah, senor Travis. I don't know why all of this is happening to our little town of Chumayo. Maybe-- maybe it's punishment from God. God, I hope not. Mayor Montero. Senorita Clark. Mr. Travis. Ms. Clark. I want you to know that I understand the situation down here, and the explosiveness of it. But it's news. As a television reporter, it's my job to get that story the public, and I want that story. And I want the tape. Okay, I know how your company feels. But I also know what they tried to pull. I don't want you to get the idea that the media's giving in, but I will make a deal with you. I get the story, and you get the tape. I want an exclusive on it. When the mayor feels that it's perfectly comfortable to release the story, I'll release it. Senorita, I have no idea how soon we will find a solution to our problems. what do you think, Senor Travis? I think Ms. Clark is playing both ends against the middle. "Patty," please. Let's drop the formalities. We're in this together, whether you like it or not. Look, Patty, you've been pushing on this pollution thing. And you've been playing around with local superstitions. Now, to me, they're both one in the same thing. Now, somebody-- maybe it's Sanchez-- is using the superstition angle to get back at the plant. Now, I know the pollution problem is bad, but we're working on it. Without this plant down here producing concrete, this town would die. And what about Laura Manley? Look, I don't know who or what killed Laura Manley, but it served Sanchez's purpose, didn't it? It terrified the hell out of the workers, and it's totally disrupted production at the plant. Okay, I'll listen to you, but you give me the truth. How about it? I am thinking it is best we all work together. We must put a stop to all this talk about demons and creatures in the lake. We mustn't let this thing get out of hand. Only if I find we cannot handle the situation would I call on the government for help. Now, look, we don't want the government in this. The chemists will solve the pollution problem. If we work together, it's our job to prove to the people that there's nothing in the lake. (humming) That's the thing Travis was telling dad about. It's a combination sonar/radar. It bounces a sound wave back to a receiver from any solid object in the lake. Travis did believe me. Who says so? They sent for something that'll prove it, didn't they? How did you know where it was? I heard dad tell Pete where to set t up. Boy, are you looking for trouble. Aw, come off it, Andrea. It proves dad didn't think I was lying. He just didn't want to believe I could be right. But I've got a better way to prove there's something in that lake. How? We're gonna use the new lens dad just bought, and get a picture. We? You and me. You're crazy if you think I'm gonna spend the night out by the stupid lake fighting off mosquitoes, waiting or you to get a stupid picture of a stupid monster that'll probably turn out to be a stupid log or something.

It is true, I tell you. I can see this monster. It's true, it's true, it's true! I can see the monster. I am no witch. I saw it, it's true. It's true! It's true! (exclaims in Spanish) Enough! I have heard all this before. The priest has failed. She is possessed! (crying out) (man speaking Spanish) Father, forgive them. (screaming) (straining) (woman screaming) (shouts indistinctly) (all shouting) Aah! (explosion) That Sanchez did one hell of a job on us. It'll take a week of repairs to get this place back into full operation. Sanchez did a hell of a job on himself. There wasn't enough left to bury. what about the dynamite? I'm ready as soon as I get the bait. I don't like trying to keep that stuff cool. I want to move tomorrow. Look, you'll have the bait this afternoon. but I can't guarantee the helicopter. what do you mean? Look, the doc called Bogata, and they can't take her there. They're gonna take her to Panama, to the burn center. She might have a chance. (helicopter idling) These ought to get us a helicopter. Mayday, 940, don in wooded area. Grid map, six-apple. Coordinates 1-4 and 9-2. Can affect landing in open space, those coordinates. Repeat, can affect landing open space, those coordinates. Will indicate wind direction. Repeat, will indicate wind direction. It's a good thing you want to fly the chopper, huh? (speaks Spanish) Si. And I know what we're doing is a dirty trick, but it'll get us a chopper. Si, senorita. (speaking Spanish) Well, we are not far off the regular patrol run. Big line up there, they had to bring the goat. I feel like a movie star. Pete, you're doing just fine. We're the ones who are nervous. (sighs) Well, I've checked and double checked it every which way. It should work. It better. Senors, in the air. Get your hands in the air. I arrest you for trespassing on this property. Come on, follow me. Come on, move. This side. Come on. (speaking Spanish) (engines powering up) (speaking Spanish) He'll call us if he sees anything in the lake. Good. Remember, don't turn the switch. it takes the bait until the cable's taut, or you'll blow us right out of the air. Don't worry, I'll be careful. How long you think we have this helicopter? I had them radio in the day, spend the night in an open field working on a minor motor problem. We have to let them loose this afternoon, then I have to face the consequences. Look, don't worry about a thing. The plant will cover you. Besides, who'd believe this story anyway? I hope you're right. I hope we're all right. Well, let's get the show on the road. (engine powering up) (excited chatter) (speaking Spanish) Not to get too close. Just find a place. We will wait for them. Gracias. (machine humming) (beeping) (speaking Spanish) I hope to hell it floats. (Travis) Told you those air pillows would do the trick. So far so good. Let's start fishing. Hold on. (beeping) Maybe it doesn't like lamb. (beeping) I read you. We have contact with something in the lake. (roaring) (alarmed shouts) (roaring) Christ, I don't believe it! (roaring) God, the witness, You see, deliver us from this serpent of hell in our lake, Look at it. It's as big as a whale. (roaring) (man) What happened? Take this thing down. I'm going for a swim. ♪♪ (growling) (growling) (roaring) (roaring) Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! (roaring) You're doing fine. Just remember to get the cable tight... so it still makes contact. Hyah! Not yet. (roaring) (roaring) (roaring) This is it. (roaring) (roaring) (cheers and applause) (speaking Spanish) Amen. (all) Amen. What you have just witnessed is not a movie of the week, it is not fiction. If I hadn't seen it myself, I would not have believed it. It is stranger than fiction, which the truth always is. It is something we will never be able to forget. Son, I'm proud of you. You did a great job. (cheers and applause) (all cheering) Chakai. Here, Chakai. ♪♪ Chakai. Chakai? Chakai. (Andrea) Chakai (whimpering) Here, boy. Here, Chakai. Chakai, where are you?
