Goodbye. - Goodbye. Carmela. Forgive me for making you wait as always. By the way, happy birthday! Thank you. How's it going? - Good. Can we open the door? Come on. Neither for you nor for me. Let's leave it like this, okay? You already know that nothing happens behind the door. It's all right. Well, how's it going? How have these weeks been with mom? Good. Would you like some water? How was school? Did you get any grades? Come on, Carmela. Make an effort. An eight in biology. OlĂŠ! Is that right? You're the best! Congratulations! I didn't really study. Imagine if you did study... He's here. - Already? Can he wait a moment, please? I'll go get him now. - Okay, but don't be long. I've got a full house. What's up? How are you doing? I'm nervous. I know... It's normal. Take it easy. What if he asks something about mom? If he asks something about mom... you don't have to answer. Carmela, this is for you to see each other. For you to enjoy a good time together. Nothing else matters. Is that clear? Is it clear? So I'm letting him in? Come on, let's go! What's up, chick? How are you? Here's to you. Happy birthday. Thank you. Do you like it? - Yes. How many is that? Twenty... - Twelve. I know it's twelve. You think I don't know? So? How's everything, how are you? How's school? She got her grade in biology. Oh yeah? And? An eight. You got an eight in biology? Damn, I don't think I've ever gotten that in my life. You're so smart, Carmela. You're going to be the smartest in the family. What, what's the matter? What's wrong with her? She's a little nervous today. No, Carmela, no. Why is that? Did something happen at home? No, I was going to meet my friends today. Today? You were supposed to spend the day together, for your b-day. Yeah, but we've been saying that for days. And couldn't it be another day? It had to be today. Today Helena's parents aren't at home. What were you going to do? Nothing. Nothing? What do you mean, nothing? It has to be something. What's that? What, Carmela? We were going to shave our heads. Really? Holy shit, I love it. The whole head? That's cool, isn't it? I wore it like that, many years ago. Don't you remember a picture that was at grandpa's? Ah, yes. - I shaved this part and kept this long. Hey, what if I go with you? To the hair salon? - Sure. Mom won't let me. Right. Well, that's something else. I don't know, it's up to you. It's your hair, isn't it? You're the one who's going to wear it. You're twelve years old, Carmela. You're old enough to decide how you want to look. Don't you think so? What do you say? Let's do it? Okay. That's my girl! Come on, let's go. Let's go outside. - Come on, yes. You have to sign here and here. Carmela, are you sure? Don't you think you should tell your mother first? If I tell her, she'll say no. If you want to come back earlier, you just have to let me know, ok? Okay. At eight o'clock you have to be here. Is that all right? - Come on, yeah. Let's go. - Bye. We catch up later! What hair salon are we going to? We can go to Lucia's. Hey, the hairdresser's there. - The what? The hairdresser's. Let's go home better, right? I can do it for you, I have the razor. Why spending money? Don't you think? Come in. Leave your stuff wherever you want. You've already been in the house, haven't you? Yes, once. Do you want something to eat? No, it doesn't matter. I have Coke. No, seriously. Let's see, come on. Here. Let's see how we do this. The back of the neck can be cool. It can be cool. Or the sides. The sides can be cool, right? What's up, Carmela? I don't know if mom's going to like it. Fuck, Carmela. Do you want to do it or not? Who cares what your mother says. Do you want to do it or not? What are you doing? Let's see. You look pretty. Do you want to fuck me up or something? What do you put PIN for? Can we go for lunch another day? Why? What's the matter? My tummy hurts. Do you want me to stop? - No. If you want, we can go home. - No, no. Can we go back to the meeting point? Now, Carmela? It's too early, we haven't done anything yet. Do you want to go already? It's not that. I'm not going to take you to the meeting point now, Carmela. Shit, can't you spend a few hours with me anymore? I'm not asking you to stay with me for days, but you won't even put up with me for a few hours? Fuck. What's the matter, did she eat your brains? What? Answer. What the fuck is wrong with you, Carmela? Please, take me to the meeting point. Fucking hell. If it wasn't for your fucking mother we wouldn't be like this. Let go of the fucking cell phone. I'm not going to fucking do anything to you. Relax, Carmela. Fuck. I'm not going to do anything to you, dammit. I'm not going to do anything to you, my love. Forgive me. Carmela forgive me, okay? I just want to spend our allotted hours with you. And that's it. The two together. My love. Come on, I'll take you home. - No. I'll give you a ride home, it's okay. Give me the address, come on. - No, I won't. Tell me where it is. You want to go home, I'll drive you. Give me the address. Tell me where it is. Holy shit, Carmela. Tell me where it is. I'm taking you home. And that's it. - I can't. You want to go home, I'll take you home. I can't, dad, please. Where is it? Fucking tell me! Tell me, for fuck's sake. Straight ahead. Still this way? Now to the left. No no, Carmela! What are you doing? Carmela!
