[Conga drum plays] [Bells jingle] [Mambo music plays] [Maracas shake] Lirim, I'll be done in a bit. I thought you weren't home till later? Yeah, I only had a few accounts left to tackle Decided to come home, finish work here before we head to Terrance and Sam's. Taylor, where's my cardboard? Where I have continuously asked you to place it when you leave. So what'd you get? Merlot. Of course. Well, it's user friendly. It's the safe choice. We're having artichoke lasagna tonight. You should have got the Sangiovese. Well, we can go back and get one? No, no, no. It's my fault. Information you were unaware of. Are you sure? Babe. Merlot is fine. I'm gonna' jump in the shower, you wanna' join? -What... Right now? -Yeah, we have ten minutes. Lirim. Tick, tick. Hey babe, do you have a cough suppressant? I'm feeling a little scratchy. -No... -God, the last thing I need right now is to come down with something. I saw the Beltracchi exhibit! I mean, we start publicity packages next week for three different companies and I'm getting sick right now, this is fantastic. I saw the original forgeries. Hey babe, get my back. Yeah, yeah, okay, good. Okay, turn around, I'm gonna', I'm gonna' get you. -Alright, let's go. -Ah wait-- Hello, Hello. -Hello newlywed, good to see you. -Welcome you two. Looking good. Likewise. Come in, come in. Sam, honey. Merlot, lovely, thank you. Well it is user friendly. I love the picture- The picture is how I pick all my wines- I like the picture, I like the wine. Then people think you're cultured and no one knows your secret. Well, now I know your secret. Shhh, shhh, shhh ,shhh. -Hey you two. -Hey good to see ya'. -Good to see you too. -Looking good. -Hi. -Hi. Oh here, let me take your things. Yeah, sure. And I hope you too are ready because the food just finished. Um, Terrance, would you mind helping me? No, no. Let me. Let me grab that wine Terrance. -What are we doing? -Okay, Great. Wanna' see the house? Oh, the food looks fantastic. Aye! Thank you. Here, you can open the wine. Sam. Uh-huh? -Sam... -Yeah. We landed Morganstalk and Co. this afternoon. We start finance packets this week for them. -Oh my gosh, congratulations! -I know, I know! Oh my gosh! K, send me the numbers and I'll write you up a spread sheet. No, Monday, Monday. Anyway, how's the newlywed lifestyle going? [Sam sighs] Terrible. I've um, gained fifteen pounds and Terrance does nothing but drink and screw me. Sounds fantastic, I'm jealous. Don't be. Oh, here, try this. What do you think? As good as it looks? Better. Sam, I have to say, that wedding was gorgeous. Everything that I would ever dream of. Thank you. Oh, and how are you and Lirim? We're great, we couldn't be better. Great. Uh... I know everyone says it, but, I never expected it to be this good. You know how it is? Finding the person that you're gonna' be with for the rest of your life. Aren't we blessed? Yeah, and capitalism gives everyone an equal opportunity to forge their own bank accounts. I mean, its also necessary to note that qualification is important when it comes to establishing competitive commerce. -Absolutely, if I'm gonna' hire you to manage my finances, you better have an idea. -Mhmm. Exactly, and that is the most important thing, qualification. Why are you the best? Right, like, why should I hire you? And there's such a lack of understanding of the importance of value circulation. The more that goes around, comes around. Yeah be competitive, there's always money to be earned. Right, society created the value attached to the dollar we trade So now it's up to society to adapt and keep up with that standard it set. And that's why I love you baby. You two disgust me. Oh, you know what would have been great? A Sangiovese. Alright, enough talk about money. Let's talk about you two. Are there any wedding bells in your near future? Absolutely, you know, when the time is right, finances and all the other adult stuff. And... and we haven't really discussed it -It's a huge step as you both know... -Right but when you know you know. I mean I thought it was gonna' be so much harder to say yes to him, but I was shocked at how easy it was. It really is a weight that's lifted when it's all said and done. Well How about you two just worry about making us uncles and we'll make sure you get an invitation. -Bye. -Thank you so much for your hospitality. It was so good to see you. -I'll see you Monday right? -Yes, absolutely, don't forget to send me those numbers. Of course, of course. -It was nice meeting you sweet heart. -Thank you. -It was a pleasure, absolute pleasure. -Bye. -See ya. -Ok bye, get home safe. Mhmm. -Are you safe to drive? -One hundred percent. So what do you conclude? -'Bout what? -Terrance and Sam. Oh they're great, I'm really happy for them. You know when I first met Terrance I thought he was gay. He is. Stop. So what do you think about what they said? What specifically, they talked about a lot? Well, about marriage and families and knowing when you know. What are you getting at? Look, I know we said we'd talk about marriage once we're more comfortable financially And, yeah, our twenties are our selfish years But work's going great for both of us And I don't know, I guess it just hit me tonight what they said about knowing when you know. I feel that this would be a fantastic conversation to have tomorrow when I'm not drunk. Please, you hardly drank anything. I am so drunk. Lirim? I'm serious, are we not ready? No. They're right. When you know, you know. Good. Well, I'm glad we're on the same page Lirim 'Cuz I know that I love you. I mean, let's just go out on a whim here, move away, you could save the world, I'll handle the finances. [Lirim chuckles] Becoming and idealist are you? Yeah, you're right. Not in my reality. But that's what I love about you. You know, me, I handle people's money. I'm boring. I know that. You always seem to have both feet on the ground but Manage to keep your head in a cloud. [Kissing] Yeah. [Kissing] Mhmm. [Heavy breathing] [Conga drums play] -Hey, Blair. -Hey Lirim. Is anyone here yet? Not really, but Sam wants you to look up these locations.

Oh shit, how did you destroy that screen? Oh I don't know, it's not mine. I found it on the way here. Oh man, whoever lost that is shitting brinks I guarantee you, I know I would be.

When I first met you I had in my mind that you didn't stand a chance with me We started talking and I knew in that moment that I didn't stand a chance with you.

Eh, uh, do you uh Do you wanna' sit with me? So this is it. The lie that got him caught. Beautiful isn't it? The lie, or the painting? The painting. Though I can't help but admire him for his tenacity. I mean, what a life lived. The stories he get's to bed every night. He doesn't regret a thing. It's a big debate in the art world: Do we praise him for his genius, or shame him for his actions? Mmm. I think it makes for a pretty romantic legend. At the sake of integrity, betrayal? Oh I don't think he adheres to the status quo. Course he doesn't. How many people did he have to be? Get to be. Regardless it's a beautiful painting. How do you think Campendonk feels? Exhilarated. I think he's seeing red. He says he paints in France because the light there inspires him. His poor children. I wonder how they managed when he was in jail. [Soft music plays] So, um. Sorry I didn't respond to your text's. Just been a Crazy couple of weeks. I just figured you lost your phone. [Lirim chuckles] But no, it's been crazy for me to, I have this Project I'm working on at work. What do you do? I work with kids. It's an after school program called "Out Of Bounds!" Hmm. Right now we're trying to fund them a trip to Mexico. Really? Wow, god. [Lirim chuckles] If you could have a conversation with any animal, what would it be? [Lirim laughs] Uh...um... Probably the Bald Eagle. [Lirim laughs] -You should get a sprawling tattoo of one across your chest. -No, no, no, no. A Tramp Stamp all the way. -Ooo, dangerous. -Yeah. [Lirim chuckles] What about you? The Elephant. They have deep eyes. Think they hold all the secrets. Mmm, I'd- I'd wanna' know what it feels like to fly with lightning. I love the way Elephants step. Their whole foot just presses the Earth. [Phone buzzes] Do you need to take that? No. -It's my Dad, sorry. -No. Please, take it. Now, we don't Talk. I'm sorry. No When my Dad moved our family to Connecticut It- It wasn't for work. He was having an affair and he wanted to be closer to it. Of course my family was none the wiser. -It was just [Audrey sighs] Another school, another move, another group of friends. He told my mom that he didn't feel like himself. That he was going through some things and that he wanted a divorce. He said he felt The best course for his life was to be honest with himself and move on. During the Separation period, he moved to New York to be with Paul. His boyfriend. I know. A family moves so much and the only stable thing they have is each other and He had an affair. I haven't talked to him since. [Audrey chuckles] T.M.I -This is the part where you say, "Its not you, it's me!" [Lirim chuckles] -It's fine...

She's amazing, poetic, adventurous, leads clever conversation, she's lovely. She's a good human. But it's so weird Ted, on a personal level it's like so easy. What about on a physical level? No, no, absolutely not. No, I mean do you find her attractive physically? She's a beautiful girl. Yeah, but how do you feel when you're around her? God, um... Lirim Have you ever been with a female? Jesus Christ, seriously? -Ted! -Okay... If you want anything to happen with this girl, you've got to tell her about that. -Can't. -Why can't you? Well, at first I didn't bring it up because I didn't think it mattered, she was just this cool person And then yesterday when we were talking, she told me that her dad had an affair and divorced her mom because he's gay. -Mmm. -If I tell her that I just got out of a relationship with a man then Yeah, but if you lie to her then you will never get into her pants. -God, Ted! -You want my advice? You tell her. Women They love communication, let her know what you're going through, she might thinks its kick ass that she's turning a gay guy! I am not turning, I'm just embracing a new experience. Do you think you might be Bi? Maybe? Are you gonna' finish that? Oh, good. [Thunder rolling sounds] [Pensive music plays] [Lirim laughs] Hey!

There's one rule tonight: You have to make every wish out loud so that the Universe can hear you. -What is this? -Follow me. Okay. [Lirim laughs] Right here, right here. In this bag Is the power to create anything! [Ethereal music plays] This is our Universe. And tonight, you get to wish for anything. What?! K. Alright, here we go!

[Audrey gently laughs] The flower's are beautiful, thank you. -Tea? -Yeah, thank you. Oh my god. I haven't seen these since I was a kid. My parent's made me read these to them every night for 30 minutes. You read to your parents? Oh they were very strict on establishing an academic mindset in the formative years. Really? They were always my favorite. I wanna' live in a tree house forever. [Lirim chuckles] Brother Bear was always so mean. The Berenstain aren't perfect, but that's what makes them relatable. My parent's sure friend to be, we weren't [Tea kettle whistles] -Sugar? Uh, no. What? [Ethereal music plays] [Eerie music plays] [Lirim turns on the sink] [Thunder cracks] You are my lightning. [Birds chirp] So this is the lounge room. Um. Games, movies. And this week we're learning about apples. -"Applelicious" -Applelicious. [Lirim laughs] This is a fun place, I like it. And this is the Pre-K room, for our youngest kid's. The "Tot" room. Um, they have their snack center, their reading center; arts and crafts. [Children play] -So I hope that this is a place the kids can develop some roots. And I traveled so much as a kid that I- I like the fact the program gives them a chance to explore and see the world. That's why we're working so hard to get this fundraising under way. And you're doing this all on your own? Well the company, and the other counselors, they all play a part. [Lirim chuckles] It's just so brave. -Where'd you get your cheek bones? [Lirim chuckles] Mmm, my dad I guess. Your dad's a good man, he raised a good boy. Oh, my Dad. He wears soft soled dress shoes, tucks his polo into his khaki's He's never without a belt, and his back left pocket is worn from his wallet. Your Mom? Mmm, beautiful, uh, talks a lot, life of the party. She wears big jewelry, not to show off, she's just latin. What? Do you not have a good relationship with them? No, I do, it's just Ugh, it's so boring. Nothing new ever happens. Nothing spontaneous. Our dog is like 60 years old. You know, nothing changes. That's good though. No it's not. Uh Uh, my family has always supported everything I am. Uh, I'm grateful for that. It's just, uh I wasn't taught how to be different. You don't realize how fortunate you are.

Taylor and I dated for three years. I was miserable. My entire life has been safe. Graduated high school with honors, valedictorian. Went to college, majored in business because that is what my parents expected of me. I met Taylor and He was everything my parents wanted me to be, so I dated him. I've never done anything for me. Nothing different in my entire life until you. -I'm not an experiment. -No You're not. I am gay. I always have been. But when I met you Something happened. Something changed and you showed me a way of living I had no idea existed. You have no idea who you are. I know I love you. What do you love about me? Your sense of culture. Your sense of adventure. Your idealistic mind. The fact that you can keep both feet on the ground, but manage to keep your head in a crowd. ...That's it. I didn't know how to tell you with Your Dad and And I don't know what the hell's going on in my head But I do know that right now, you and I, right now We work. [Latin music plays] [Bar patrons laugh] I need to head home. Sure. Thanks. I called my Dad. Really? How'd that go? We talked. Lot's of tears. Angry tears. He told me how hard it was to lie. Not just to us, but to himself. He didn't know. He left to find himself. He's still not sure about everything, but he feels closer everyday. Lirim, you have to go. You have to go and find yourself. I forgave him. I love you. But you need to love you. [Lirim clears his throat] Thank you. [Lirim clears his throat] -Go. [Soft music plays] [Upbeat Latin music plays] Are you sure about this?
