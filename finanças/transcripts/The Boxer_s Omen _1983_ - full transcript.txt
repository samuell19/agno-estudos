Okay? Continue. Stop hitting like this. It's against the rules. Are you all right? If you keep doing this, I'll disqualify you. Are you all right? What was that? An ambush? Get up! Go! Hit him! Hit the Thai boxer! Hurry! Come on. One, two, three, four. Are you all right? Move over! Get up! One, two. Get up. Still won't get up? Three, four. Don't come near. Five, six, seven. How are you? So, Doctor? Can he continue? No. Judge, the doc said the Thai boxer can't continue. In tonight's final, Hong Kong vs. Thailand, the champion is Hong Kong boxer Chan Wai. You beat my brother up! - Calm down. - His neck is broken. Call the ambulance! Hurry. - Boss. - Brother Hung. Bye. Uncle Qi wants to talk to you. - Where is he? - Inside. - Uncle Qi. - Sit. Brother Hung, the mainlanders want to talk to you. Tomorrow night, 1:00 a.m., at the Xinnan Street construction site in Tsuen Wan. Their leader requested that you show up on your own. What do you think? Fine. Tell them I'll be there on time. - Thanks, Uncle Qi. - No problem. Brother Hung, I'm off. Rong. I'll go meet them alone tomorrow. Bring some guys and weapons and wait outside. - Go in and kill him if anything goes wrong. - Got it. You're very cocky! You've just arrived and you're already fighting for territory. You've got some nerve showing up here alone! I've been in Hong Kong for a long time. I've seen it all. I'll show you something you haven't seen. Uncle Qi. Turn on the lights. Called for back up? Here they are. Don't move. Chan Hung, follow me. Who are you? Who are you? Why did you save me? Come here. I need to talk to you. It's late. What are you doing with the TV on? The area around his neck suffered a heavy blow, resulting in a serious fracture. His spine is also damaged. Because it's so close to the brain, he will be paralyzed permanently. For the rest of his life? That's right. Brother, I need to tell you something. Brother, you must take revenge for me. I want to see you with my own eyes beating that Thai boxer for me. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Ba Bo has been in 62 contests since he began his boxing career. He won in the first round in 55 games. It's a great honour for the Thai boxing industry to have such a great boxer. Our great Thai boxer, Mr. Ba Bo, surely lives up to his title. During his last competition in Hong Kong, Mr. Ba Bo has taught the so-called Hong Kong champion what boxing is. Even though Mr. Ba Bo's eyes were hurt, he still put up a good fight to the end. Unfortunately, the Hong Kong judge favoured their boxer. Mr. Ba Bo, a true sportsman, didn't complain. To us, he's the real winner. He's shown the world the spirit of Thai boxing. It's hard to come by. On behalf of Thailand Boxing Association, I present the champion's belt to Mr. Ba Bo. Thank you. Champion? That bastard! You again, Hong Kong boy! What kind of champion are you? You don't play by the rules. And all your dirty tricks! Even if the whole world thinks you're the champion, I'll always think otherwise. You hurt my brother. If you're so good, you can try to beat me. You think you're qualified to be a champion? Show me what you've got! Beat him! Beat the Hong Kong guy! Shut up. Hong Kong boy, in three months, I'll claim your life in Hong Kong. Be my guest, Thai boy. Over to the temple there. We've been expecting you, Mr. Chan. The abbot invites you in. - Do you know me? - Please follow me. Mr. Chan Hung, I've been expecting you. And you're here finally. How did you know my name? That's not all. I knew about your arrival today. How come? It's a long story. A year ago, our abbot went to Hong Kong to take care of a black magician, Mai Gusu. Mai Gusu. How dare he kill my bat? Revive! Revive! Revive! Get up! Get up! Leave! What else is there to see? Leave! There's nothing else to see. Get up! Leave! Don't you run! He broke my magic again, damn! Grant me power, Lord of the Dark. Grant these spiders power! Drink up. Grant me infinite power, Lord of the Dark. And under those circumstances, the needles poisoned Abbot Qing Zhao's eyes, and he died. Abbot Qing Zhao was about to achieve immortality. Because of the poisonous spell, he couldn't fulfil his wish. Unless someone could break the spell. Before his death, I was told to put his remains inside an urn. And he prophesied that three months later, today, a man named Chan Hung would come here to break the spell. He was right. Here you are, Mr. Chan. It's unbelievable. Abbot Qing Zhao said that we should open the urn once you're here. If his body is decomposed, then cremate the body at once, and forget about any revenge. But if his body is still in good condition, then he'll show you a sign. Follow me, Mr. Chan. You've got it wrong. I don't know him. Could that be him? Impossible. Mr. Chan, this is Abbot Qing Zhao. Where's his body now? Break up the urn. Is that him, Abbot? Hey! Chan Hung. Come here. I need to talk to you. You must be curious as to why I've summoned you here. It's because we were twins in our past lives. That's why your fate is similar to mine in this life. What? We were twins in our past lives? That's right. So whatever happens to me will happen to you, too. A year ago, the poisonous golden needles spell hit me. An ordinary person would be dead already, and my body would be decomposed, and you'd be dead. But my body hasn't decomposed, and you're still alive. It's all because of my practice of Buddhism. I almost achieved immortality, but because I was hit by the poisonous spell, I couldn't succeed. Bullshit. Do me a favour. At least for the sake us being twins. Please listen. Do yourself a favour. By the time my body decomposes, it'll be your time of death. You can't avoid it. Good afternoon, Thai International. Can I help you? I would like to reconfirm my seat to Hong Kong. Can I have your name, sir? My name is Chan Hung. C-H-A-N H-U-N-G. When do you want to leave, sir? Tomorrow morning, okay? Confirmed. Mr. Chan Hung, I'm really happy for Abbot Qing Zhao. You've decided to work with us. But first, you need to retire from the world. What? I need to be a monk? That's right. It's the only way to defeat evil. That means I need to shave my head? Chan Hung, from now on your name is Kaidi Baluo. It's up to the person to practice Buddhism. Meditate in the water. Remember, endurance. Be still. Endurance! Yes, endurance. You can get up now. Leeches! Kaidi Baluo, are you willing to take up Buddhism and to defeat all evil? Yes. Have you followed the laws of Buddha? Yes. Have you broken the rules of no killing, no gambling, and no greed? No. Have you broken the rule of abstinence? No. So you've succeeded. You are now ready to defeat evil. Yes. I'm not afraid of you. Show me what you've got! Lord of the Dark! Go! Out, little bats. Get up! Attack the monk! Up! Lord of the Dark, grant power to this rice. Revive them. Get up. Charge! Attack the monk! Go forward! Attack! Don't you run! Damn you! I'm full of power now. Surely I can beat you. Lord of the Dark, bring out your full power. I still have my magic weapon. Check this out! Come out. Come out. Follow my order! Come out! The sun's out. You want to run? Forget it. Kaidi Baluo, you've broken the spell on Abbot Qing Zhao and destroyed the evil. That means you've saved yourself. And Abbot Qing Zhao can achieve immortality. You can return to Hong Kong now. It's me. Where were you? You haven't come here for a while. - I was in Thailand. - You shaved your head, too. - I've seen through the vanity of the world. - I don't believe that. You must have slept with lots of girls in Thailand. Don't pass me any STDs or I'll castrate you. Wait, let me check. I was a monk for three months. It's about time! Put it down. Untie the strings. Hurry. Come help. Hurry. Crocodile eggs! Careful. Today is a very exciting match. Thai champion Ba Bo, who defeated the world champion in Japan. His challenger, who was in 53 fights and won all of them, is Hong Kong champion Chan Hung. Ba Bo weighs 185 pounds, and Chan Hung, 162 pounds. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the match to begin. Please be seated for the match. All this food will bring you back to life. It's a foul. You kicked his groin. Come on. Bravo! Beat him. Kill him! Kill him! What now, Brother Hung? Beat him. One, two. Brother Hung. One, two, three, four, five. Get up! Get up and beat him. One, two, three, four, five. Ping, throw in the towel. Surrender now. Never. I must defeat the Thai boxer. Good. The winner is Chan Hung, from Hong Kong. Brother Hung. Brother Hung, open up. Abbot! Save me, Abbot. My eyes! I am not sure why... Say no more. I know. Other magicians increased the magical power of the needle's poison. Abbot Qing Zhao can never achieve immortality, and you're in trouble, too. What should I do? Have you broken any rules while you were in Hong Kong? Don't lie. No, I didn't. Good. Then I'll arrange another duel for you. Another one? You're facing a stronger match this time. I will lose. Don't worry. I'll help you. Found it! - What? - Thousand-year-old Ganoderma. Thousand-year-old Ganoderma? Kaidi Baluo, hand me the honey. What are you doing there, teacher? Extracting some Essence of Iron. Because it only appears on the thousand-year-old Ganoderma, it's the only place to collect it. It's a rare foreign matter in Thailand. Inside the human body, it'll run along with the blood, and the person will become invincible. Why honey? Rumour has it that it's attracted to honey. Let's wait here. Yes, master. The necklace. Kneel. When you're in danger, put this Essence of Iron amulet inside your body, and it will protect you. Will it come back out afterwards? Only under severe pressure. It will come out from your eyes. You must carry it at all times. Yes, master. Kaidi Baluo. Now in your hands you have the Diamond Sutra and the Amitabha Sutra. Repeat your vows in front of the Buddha. Have you broken the rule against consuming alcohol? No. And have you broken the rule of abstinence? No. Why did you lie to the Buddha? Why are you asking me? I should ask you why. I had nothing to do with the whole thing, but I got dragged into this mess. I was about to die. I did it for myself. That's why I took my chances. I didn't believe that I wouldn't win if I broke the rules. There's no use. You broke the rule and lied to Buddha. It's a big sin. You've lost all your powers now. Please leave right away! What? Are you telling me to leave? It's not that easy. I won't go till I meet Abbot Qing Zhao. He won't see you anymore. He won't? Then I'll go to see him. You can't go. Why not? Who are you to say no? Monk, you started this, and now I'm in the middle of it. I'm suffering because of you! You have to fix it. Come on! What now? Silence? Stop the act. You had so much to say when you begged me last time! Are you pretending to be a mute now that I need help? It's a two-way street. You're not a friend. I'm talking to you. Speak up! You dead monk, speak up! Fine, I'll trash this temple. Still not talking? Chan Hung, at this point, it's no use to throw a tantrum. My body is decomposing, and you'll die, too. You must have a way. Help me! Help! Now neither of us can help each other. You'll die in half a month when my body's decomposed. The only way is if you can find the precious Buddhist relic. What Buddhist relic? In a past life, I was the lama named Lanbuyi. When I died in Nepal, all my power was stored in the Golden Ashes. Where is it now? In Katmandu, at Nador Buddhist Lamasery. Ladies and gentlemen, please observe that smoking is no longer permitted. Kindly put your seat upright and return the table to its locked position. Also, kindly note that the use of cameras is not permitted on flight and at the airport. Thank you. Please follow me, ladies and gentlemen. We will go inside the temple to see very interesting places. You can see anything there and you will enjoy it. So please, follow me. And thank you. Please be careful. The prayer will start now. This statue of Buddha is the largest in Nepal. This lama temple, the Nador Buddhist Temple, is the cradle of Nepalese Buddhism. The description of it can be found in the volume, The Frontiers of Great Time. The monk Tang Xuanzang passed here as a pilgrim on his way to India to collect the holy sutras. The Chinese then referred to Nepal as Cheng Chu, while the Indians called it Nepal. It's the only underground Buddhist temple of its kind in the world. The temple has become one of the Nepal's most sacred shrines because it contains the relic known as the Golden Ashes. The ashes belongs to one of the Temple's chief lamas. There are only three similar examples of venerated ashes in the Buddhist world. The first is that of the original Buddhist, Siddhartha Sakyamuni, now said to be in the shrine in India. The second is that of the Tang Xuanzang, said to be in a shrine in China. And then the third to be that of the high Tibetan lama Lanbuyi, who carried Buddhism to Nepal and was the founder of Buddhism in China. His ashes are the ones preserved in this temple. - Where? - Up above! The Golden Ashes lying in the palm of the huge Buddha are not normally visible. They will only be seen for a few moments after sunrise, when the sun rays shining into the Buddha's eyes are reflected in the outstretched palm. This is Buddha's traditional strange phenomenon of the Golden Ashes glowing as if the Buddha is guiding. According to the Buddhist legend of human touching, the Golden Ashes receive Buddha's blessings. Since the Buddhas are so valuable, isn't there a danger they be stolen? Apparently the temple is protected by supernatural forces. And so far as is known, no theft or looting has ever taken place. Intruder alert! Intruder alert! Would I have to wait until sunrise? The Buddhist relic!
