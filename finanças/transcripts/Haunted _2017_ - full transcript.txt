HAUNTED I love you. I have to make a phone call. Hello? Who was it? My dad died this morning. WILL I'm okay. We hadn't talked for six months. - Where are you going? - I have to sell my dad's stuff. - An old house in the country. - In the country? I need an estate agent to look at it. What kind of house? A summer cabin? We used to spend Christmas there. I'd forgotten about the whole place. I just need to get it done. You won't even notice that I'm gone. This will be good for us. No, I don't need it. I'm getting rid of it. I'm sure. Do I get a pill in advance? In that case, I would like an appointment before Christmas. The 23rd of December? Okay. Thanks. Hi. Hi. Everyone calls me Daisy. Do you live around here? - You're going sledding? - I always go there. It's the best spot. On our property? Okay. Bye. - Do you want to join me? - I don't have time. - Why not? - I have a lot to take care of. Like what? - You're very inquisitive. - Yeah. - I am selling the house. - I see. - Bye. - Do you have children? No. That's what I thought. Two? - Hi. - So, you're open? - What can I do for you? - I'm selling a house. Fredheim. You might know where it is. - Everyone knows about Fredheim. - Good. Are you able to come and inspect it? - When? - Today. I can't today. Are you sure you can't come today? I would like to get it done. - Try calling me tomorrow. - Thank you. I'll call you. Hello? Hello? Who are you? You must be Cathrine. Yes. I knew your mother. We were friends. Sorry for barging in but the door was open. I thought I heard someone so I went to check it out. I can't believe you're all grown up, Cathrine. - You don't remember me? - No. No, it's been a long time. You have a lot of work ahead of you. Nothing's been done since the 50s. I'm just going to clean and tidy. The buyers can do the rest. That's good. There is nothing for you here. Will you be able to sell it? - I hope so. - After everything that's happened... You talk as if there are ghosts here. I can't remember any from when I was little. What do you remember? Very little, actually. Do you remember people talking about Marie? Marie? She disappeared. Only seven years old, poor thing. Marie was your mother's sister. Did my mum have a sister? She just disappeared. From one day to the next. But... What happened? It was... I'm sorry. Excuse me. I'm looking for my sister. You don't remember me? No. Good to see you again. And that you have grown up. Good bye. MARIE, CHRISTMAS 1952 Hello? Hello. This is Cathrine Berggrav. We spoke about Fredheim yesterday. Would you be able to come and have a look today? - When? - Some time today? Today? No... Hello? The person you are calling is not available at the moment. Remember your appointment at the clinic the 23rd of December. What are you doing? You have reached Markus. Please leave a message. Hi, it's me. I'll have to stay another night. I drove the car into a ditch, but don't worry. No! Markus... What are you doing here? I thought you'd be happy to see me. Of course I am. I thought it was just an ordinary house. There are still many things I don't know about you. Your family? - Is that you? - Yes. It's good to see you. How did you end up here? My mum made it. Is that the two of you? Yes, I think so. It must have been great. Candles lit, the table set... Porridge left out for Santa. Great. It must have been. Then mum died. What happened? I don't remember. I just remember a car ride not long after. Dad was very quiet and drove too fast. I remember I couldn't sleep on my own after that. It was an accident. Where? - What do you mean? - Where did it happen? It must have happened here. I think it happened here. Are you okay? Good morning. Here you are. There is more if you're hungry. I think this will do. Thanks. - I'll start downstairs. - A handyman? What are you doing? No! It won't work. It's locked. There is no point. There is no key. Did you put this in front? I thought I heard something in there. Ghosts? What's happening to this wall? - It's rotten. - Don't ruin any more. Let's take it down. We can open it up. If we remove everything that is rotten, the house will need to come down. There you are. You mustn't stand in the middle of the road. Hey. Are your parents around? Mum is just inside all day. Dad is on a business trip. What happened to you? Hey! What are you doing? There's a little girl here. I'm worried about her. I don't think she comes from a happy home. You could at least pretend to care. Of course I care. MARIE, CHRISTMAS 1954 I'm sorry. - I don't know. I just... - It's just natural. "A Homemakers Happy Life." That's a good one. "Fast Food for Busy Housewives." What's this one? "The Chameleon." "About a women who is a danger to men, but most of all to herself." Is that you, honey? Are you okay? Has anything happened? Do you want to come in? You're not wearing enough clothes. You can tell me anything, no matter what. I thought you knew. Do you want me to come with you? I can talk to your mum. Should we do that? Wait here. I'll grab a coat. Wait here! - Have you seen a little girl? - A girl? - She's not wearing much. - Is she out on the ice? I don't think so. This is your family. But not my aunt. - Your aunt? - Yes, Marie. No. I remember that dad couldn't help decorate the tree. They were out searching. - Didn't they find her? - No. - What do you think happened? - I don't know. Your granddad was hoping to find her when the ice melted, but... Spring came but she never appeared. She couldn't get very far. She was just seven. Your granddad never lost hope. He couldn't accept that she was gone. Is that why her name isn't on the gravestone? He wanted there to be a space just in case... No, I don't know any more. I think you should leave this alone. You need to move on, Cathrine. You're acting like your mum. My mum? She was always digging around. Honey... Coffee, bread, dinner, candles, anything else? No. You should get some sleep. Do that. Hi. I tried ringing but I had no reception. No... Come in. Wow! What a view! - What was that? - Nothing. Should we continue? As you can see, there is plenty of room. You don't want to keep it? Rot would be a different matter. - I'll hear back from you, then? - I should take a look at the basement. You can't. The door is locked. I can't find the key. - I'll fix that. - Yes, please do. I'll get hold of a surveyor. You'll hear from me. - Bye. - Have a nice day. Hi. You can do it. We have to get up now. That's the hardest part. They are nice. Would you like to come in? You look cold. Don't listen to what people say. It's nice and warm in there. Besides, I'll be there with you. Are you hungry? Should we dress up? Let's find a clown's costume for me. This. It's not very clown-like. How about this? Or this. Aren't you dressing up? No. We're ready. But... You need a scarf. No, no... No. This will have to do. Let's play hide and seek. I'll hide. Start counting. One, two... Three... Four... Five... Six, seven... Eight... What are you doing? Daisy and I are playing hide and seek. We got dressed up. Daisy? Be quiet. We're playing hide and seek. I'll go and unpack. You frightened me. Look what I found. Daisy, it's not nice to scare people. What's going on? - Nothing. - Something is going on. A lot is happening, actually. Sounds in the house. Daisy having problems. Marie who disappeared, and my mum who died. I can help you. - I can help you. - I'm fine. Yes, you're fine. Is that what you're discussing with the doctor on the 23rd? - Are you talking about our child? - Have you been on my mobile? - Have you been on my mobile? - You should talk to me first. I need to be alone. I want to be left alone. - No, I'm staying. - Leave now. - I'm staying. - Let go of me. I'm staying here. I love you. I'm staying. - Let go! - I'm staying with you. - Let go, I said! - I'm staying. Let go! I'm sorry. Go! Go! "Disappeared on the 23rd of December." "Mother and daughter were alone." "Medical journal, Hedvig Berggrav, born 1920." Grandma. THE PATIENT IS ADMITTED AFTER PSYCHOTIC INCIDENTS Is this what you were looking for? I didn't want you digging in the past like this. I would like to be on my own. Why can't you just tell me what you know? I think you should leave this place. What did my mum discover? The evening Marie disappeared- -your grandma was alone with her. Your mother became obsessed with a rumour. What? That your grandmother had killed Marie. MEDICAL JOURNAL THE PATIENT HAS NO HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS 10TH DECEMBER 1955: PATIENT DISCHARGED Hello? Hello! Sorry to disturb just before Christmas. I tried ringing you. Well, just follow me. Subsidence. We can check what the basement has to offer. Did you find the keys to the door? This wall is in a funny place. We need to move this. Grab hold of that. Would you like some coffee? - We'll wait. We're trying to open this. - It can't be done. Go! - Get out! - The door is open. What are you doing? She's completely mad. Daisy! Marie Berggrav. She couldn't have gotten far. She was only seven years old. This wall is rotten. December 1955... ...that your grandmother had killed Marie... You need a scarf. There is a little girl here. I've seen her. I'm merry on Christmas Eve As that's when Jesus was born The star shone bright for all to see And angels sang so sweet All the candles our mother lights So every corner is lit You have a pretty voice. Hi. Hi. I love this. I didn't mean to. It's okay. What would you like to do now? "The witch said: 'You can have as many Rapunzels as you want. But you must give me the child you are expecting.'" That's not what she looks like. - What do you mean? - The witch. She doesn't look like that in real life. Were you too locked up here? She can't hurt you any more. There, there. You have to let me go. Let go! I'm sorry. Who are you? What do you mean? Show me your necklace. Show it to me! Were is the other one? Why have you come back? What du you want, Marie? I'm not Marie. No! Stop! I don't want to! Marie! Marie! No! I don't want to go in the basement! No, I don't want to. Look! It's you! She painted you. No! Marie... Come out! I know you're here. No! What do you want? What do you want, Marie? What do you want? I'm not Marie. Mum... It's just me. Cathrine. No! Hi. Do you live nearby? Are you not dressing up? Mummy. I killed my mummy. Come. "He brought her to his kingdom, where they were greeted with joy. Rapunzel and the prince embraced. And they lived happily ever after." And that was the end of that story. And the witch was gone? Yes, and the witch was gone.
