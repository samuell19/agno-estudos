General Houston's arrived, gentlemen. Refreshments ? Thank you, Doc. Seventy-one cold, windy, rump-bumping miles since yesterday. You wouldn't have it any other way, Lightfoot. Company, trot ! Company, halt ! Ten-hut ! That is all. Don Esparza. Compadre. Pardon, General Houston, may I order the men to bivouac ? These last two forced marches rather took it out of them. The foot soldiers may. Feed the others, care for their horses. And tell them there'll be another forced march within the hour. Yes, sir. Sergeant ? - Yes, sir. - come with me ! - Doctor. - Sam. - Dickinson. - General, sir. General, it ain't none of my business, but you ain't ate since yesterday. I'll set it on the table here. Where's jim Bowie ? When certain people ain't ate, they're meaner than a bobcat. Mr. Dickinson, I asked you a question. Where's jim Bowie ? He's indisposed, sir. Indisposed ? By god, if you mean drunk, you say drunk, sir. He's drunk, sir. What's your name ? James Butler Bonham. In Travis' command, sir. Neill, you'll go north with me. Colonel Travis will be in command here. Major, sir. Colonel, Travis. I'll send the commission through. Thank you, General. Let me assure you that ... we can dispense with the amenities, Colonel. Now, I’ve been given command of the armies of Texas, but the fly in the buttermilk is ... there ain't no armies in Texas. A few good friends, some willing men. I'll have to knock them into an army. And to do that, I need time. You people right here on the rio grande ... are gonna have to buy me that time. Keep Santa Anna off the back of my neck ... until I can get in shape to fight him. General, I assume you're ordering me to ... damn it, I’m ordering you to command ! How and what you do is your problem ! But, Sam, what about jim Bowie ? Jim Bowie, as Mr. Bonham has informed us, is indisposed. Yes, sir. But I’d like to point out, sir, that jim Bowie's leading 100 volunteers, Whereas young Travis here ... commands less than 30 regulars. Twenty-seven. General Houston, I think we ought to discuss this ... Clear the room ! Gentlemen, I would have a word with Mr. Travis ... if you'll excuse us. Con Permiso. Mr. Travis, were you going to ... complain to me about jim Bowie ? Not complain, sir. Of course jim Bowie's drunk. He took this town from General Cos. He fought a battle. Now he's drunk. Seems kind of natural to me. Or perhaps you question something other ... than Bowie's drinking ? You going to tell me that he's got a lot of acreage around here, he's married into the mexican aristocracy ? Yes, sir. Mr. Travis, I would trust jim Bowie with my life. More than that I would trust him with the lives of my family. And more than that I would trust him with the life of Texas. - Sir. - that's all, Travis. Yes, sir. Travis ? I've never been able to like you, but you're another of the very few men ... I would trust with the life of Texas. For that, thank you, sir. And it may very well be ... that life rests in your hands now. Jethro, is that you ? Yes, sir, General, this is me. Well, how does it happen you're still alive ? You had white hair when I was a little boy. Now we look like we're about the same age. Yes, sir, but I’ve been a temperate, and god-fearing man all my life, sir. Well, I guess my past is out. Jethro, tell your Mr. Jim ... I'm sorry to hear about his illness. I wish him a speedy recovery, and assure him of my affection. And General Sam, sir, he love you, too, and them words of yours ... gonna put him right back on his feet. He got a colic, you know. I heard. In the stomach. Stay temperate, old man. Neill. Column right ! Forward, yo ho ! Take care, men. You all right, Mr. Jim ? Sit down, Jethro. Can I get you something, sir ? Oh, no, no. You just sit there. Houston's gone ? Yes, sir. Come and gone, and me lying drunk. Well ... Colonel Travis ! Bowie's approaching ! Halt ! Carry on, Sentry ! Recall work parties ! Prepare for flag ceremony ! Detail, forward march ! Halt. Present. Arms ! Shoulder arms. We stand here ready to do our duty, And cognizant of the will of god. Captain Dickinson, Dismiss the ceremony ! Oh, and Captain, You will inform the men that work details will be dismissed at 4:30 ... in order that family men May gather their dependents within these walls. Yes, sir. Lieutenant Blake ! Yes, sir ! You will see to the quartering of Bowie's volunteers. Yes, sir. You men will follow me ! - Jeth. - Yes, sir. Blake will show you our quarters. Set them up. Yes, sir. Colonel Bowie. Santa Anna's got an army of 7,000 men. So ? Well, you ain't gonna try to defend ... this broken-down church ... against 7,000 battle-hard troops ? Colonel Bowie, you were drunk ... at the last officers' call, and I would rather postpone our discussion until the next, at which time I will explain my plans, and give orders for the implementing of those plans. Hey, jim ! Why do we have to work like this ? I volunteered to fight, not to build no fort. How come we have to work like this ? Because old Sam told Travis, Travis told me, and I’m telling you. Somebody coming hell-bent for leather, sinking spurs at every jump ! Halt ! Corporal of the guard, post number one ! No civilians may enter the fort, Senorseguin. I’m sorry. - Amigos. - Amigos ! Let 'em through, Dick. Captain Dickinson. Yes, sir. Come to my office, please, Captain. Yes, sir. Good afternoon, Colonel Travis. We have news of Santa Anna. My son and I have ... good day, Senorseguin. Senor,surely you should realize that though you're the Alcalde ... of San Antonio de Bexar, it does not exempt you from military prohibitions. This establishment is closed to all civilians. I'm very sorry, Colonel Travis. Had I known your restrictions ... applied to me and my family ... now, wait a minute, Travis. The Seguins have news of Santa Anna ... i don't doubt. We have a dozen rumors a day. Well, you can't just ... Por favor, juan, tell him. Colonel, the Indians of san blas ... sent couriers to the vaqueros of my properties along the Sangre de Cristo. They say large numbers of soldiers ... crossed the baja diablo two days ago. And that puts 'em a lot closer than you thought. Go ahead, juan. The Indians guessed the number of troops are over 5,000. There are also large numbers ... of mounted soldiers and supply trains. Also, lower down on the Baja Diablo, another party of Indians, saw signs of a large number of shod horses. I'm sorry, Senorseguin. But as a civilian you cannot realize ... How worthless this sort of information is. Some indian told some vaqueros ! But anyway, thank you, sir, and good day. Travis, you know the Seguins are absolutely reliable ! You'll excuse me. I meant no personal affront, Senorseguin. But I cannot make a plan of action based on third hand rumors. I do not take personal affront, Colonel Travis, else I should be forced to act, other than to simply bid you good day. Adios, juan. Adios. You're a damn fool, Travis. A true gentleman, Seguin. I dislike being rude to him. Even allowing for a charro's exaggeration, Santa Anna must have crossed the baja in the strength. But I had to do it, Dick. I'd say we have two or, at best, three days before we see his banners. The men were listening. I can't let that rabble know how weak we are, and how strong the enemy is. You couldn't do that, eh ? No, I couldn't ... my honest and truthful and plain-spoken friend. You could, perhaps, but I couldn't. Now take a look at this. This oblique rampart here. Well, have sense, Dick ! Why should those men stay, if they knew the truth of our situation ? It's different for Bowie. He's got a big stake in Texas. A couple of million acres I hear. Some of those men down there ... Why they haven't got ... You got any dollars or acres ? I've got an extra suit of clothes. You know that. Boy, so that's it ... San Antonio de Bexar. It means Saint Anthony in english. Colonel speaks spanish, you know. You going to pray, sir ? But why, sir ? I mean, there wasn't no doubt we'd find her. The Colonel just wasn't sure ... which of these creeks was the shortest cut. He ain't been here in nigh 15 years. Better make the signal, boy. Yes, sir. Hope this powder ain't damp. You don't take it wrong ... I ask all these questions, Parson ? No, boy. That's how you learn asking. Yes, sir. So many times every day, you stop and give thanks. Mostly, I can't catch on ... to what you're thanking the Lord for. I mean, there's nothing special. I give thanks for the time and the place. The time and place, Parson ? The time to live and the place to die. That's all any man gets. No more, no less. Fire the signal, boy. Yes, sir. Must be Parson and the boy ! I think so ! Well, there she be, Colonel, after 20 days of hard riding ! We're gonna have to learn the lingo they use down here, Davy ? Where do we go, Davy, to the town or to the fort ? There's no fort. It's a mission. You better take a better look. Lot of people moving in there. Them guns don't give it no mission look. Colonel, what do c-a-n-t-i-n-a spell ? Cantina. Do it mean what I think it do ? It do. It means out of these deerskins, and into our foofaraw ! Hey, you got my coat ! Hey, pedro, hand me down that guitar. Now, I want you folks ... to all clump in here close together. I want you Texicans to open up your ears, and listen to a little pure Tennessee. ♪ Here's to the ladies ♪ ♪ I love 'em all ♪ ♪ Here's to the ones I recall ♪ ♪ Here's to the ladies ♪ ♪ married or free ♪ ♪ They all look pretty good to me ♪ ♪ The big and small ones ♪ ♪ The short and tall ones ... ♪ Halt ! ♪ Here's to the ladies ♪ ♪ I love the ladies ... ♪ Captain Dickinson, split your patrol, and send half each way down the river, about five miles to look for any signs. Then report back to the mission. Yes, sir. Forward yo ! Sorry, sir. She sort of come loose ! I'd like ... I'd like to speak to David Crockett. You did. That was David Crockett, from Tennessee ? Yes, sir, and I ought to know. Me and him is neighbors back home. Only live 40 mile apart. Colonel Davy ! Are you David Crockett, sir ? That's my name. I'm Colonel Travis, commanding the Garrison. I figured. Well, son, you better start growing up. I'd like to speak to you ... on a matter of gravest importance. Sure. Let's find a corner. Talking's dry work. You're learning fast. Colonel ! I'm resigning from you. I'm going to marry Conchita and be the man of this house. Besame a kiss, senorita. I've tossed around and messed that proud spanish too. Most important part. Let's jig a little, mamacita. Light there and rest easy, Travis, while I bed down this buck. He just ain't got no head for whiskey. Parson ? Yeah, Davy ? Take him away. Yes, sir. Let's wet our whistles. Words are dusty. I don't drink. Not ever ? No. I've heard of such. Spread your wampum, Travis. My title is Colonel. Me, I’m a Colonel, too. Wouldn't it sound silly, the two of us chattering, "Colonel, Colonel" like a couple of marshfield birds ? Speak right up and call me Crockett. Don't bother with my title. Old, drunken General flatford ... gave it to me in the choctaw indian war. I'll call you Travis. Very well, Crockett. I'd like your permission to make a speech to your men. Well, i’ve heard many a speech while I was congressifying. What would you talk about ? Oh, about freedom, liberty. Well, they don't need any such speech. These men are from Tennessee. I'd like to explain why I want them ... to volunteer to fight against Santa Anna. May I ? Not so careless ! You can't get new clothes this side of Nacogdoches ! Tag ! Tennesseans ain't exactly against fighting, but they ain't much for listening to speeches. What would you tell them ? Of the unendurable hardships ... the people have been subjected to ... under the tyrannical government ... of this military dictator Santa Anna. We have no rights in the courts, no market for our produce. He has forbidden trade with the north. Davy, I want a chance for my money back. Why don't you leave Davy alone ? He done beat you 38 times hand running. Thirty-six. Thirty-eight. Thirty-six. This will only take a minute, Travis. Give me them feathers ! Gentlemen ... balance your feathers. Get set. Go ! Keep it steady, Davy ! Go ! Let's go ! Come on ! Get him, Davy ! Gotcha that time, Davy. It was fair and square. Now if we could continue, I would like ... one minute, Travis. That was just for first chance. Prepare yourself, Davy. I'm prepared. He's still on his feet ! Oh, no ! Oh, yes ! It's my turn ! Thirty-nine. Eh, Davy ? Seems like. He'll never learn. Let's get a bucket of water. Kind of a game the boys play back in Tennessee. Even though time is running out, i must postpone this interview ... until we can be assured of no interruptions. Step down off your high horse, mister. You don't get lard less'n you boil the hog. Have one of these cigars. I brought them all the way from New Orleans. Were you going to tell my Tennesseans ... that a good many men, sound men all, had a plot to ease the suffering ... of the people in these parts ? Or were you going to tell them ... that steve austin, Houston, and others, and you too, Travis, planned to declare for a republic ... to declare this the republic of Texas ? Were you going to tell them that, Travis ? I hadn't thought this was generally known. It isn't yet ... not till Austin separates the sheep from the goats. Not till he decides who's on the right side. Republic ... I like the sound of the word. It means people can live free, talk free, go or come, buy or sell, be drunk or sober, however they choose. Some words give you a feeling. Republic is one of those words ... that makes me tight in the throat ... the same tightness a man gets ... when his baby takes his first step, or his first baby shaves, and makes his first sound like a man. Some words can give you a feeling ... that make your heart warm. Republic is one of those words. Crockett ... I have, I believe, learned two things about you. Worthwhile, I hope. You're not the illiterate country bumpkin ... you would have people believe. You speak excellent and concise English when you wish. The bad grammar is a pose. A fella has to do a lot of things ... to get elected to congress. I've kissed many a baby, too. The other is that you came to Texas to fight with us. Don't tell my Tennesseans that. They think we came south ... to hunt and get drunk. They, uh ... seem to have accomplished that. Good evening, my almost vanishing lady. This is incredible. I arranged for this carriage ... I would be heartbroken if you left Bexar just now. And even more heartbroken if you left with my team horses, which would bring a pretty penny in these times, with two factions buying anything on four legs. You have business here ? Promised mother. Your mother ? Pray to the north star. Ten minutes every night. Long line of star-worshipers. It keeps the rheumatism away. It seems to me you're looking for trouble. It do ? Let's go upstairs, unless you prefer ... Discussing your business ... in front of every drunken loafer in Bexar. I suppose that overdressed ignoramus ... is one of the riffraff assembling here to resist Santa Anna. Ha ! They'll find graves and nothing else. Santa Anna will sweep across ... overdressed ? I paid good money for these clothes. Why ? Lady's luggage. Gratuity for the boy. You forgot. Dinero. Son, I guess he isn't going to tip you. Another thing I promised mother ... never to get in situations where people pointed guns at me. Ma'am, it is possible I'm mistaken, but it seems you find this gentleman's company distasteful. Tell him to get out. Thank you, sir, but there is no way which you could be of help. And I am in no danger. I bid you good night, ma'am. Gratuity for the boy. Your property, sir. And therefore we are guaranteed ... the protection of the General himself. Ah, but please don't misunderstand me, i don't want all of your lands ... half will be sufficient for me. I'm no glutton. Easy, graciela, easy. I speak your language, but that's too fast for me. Though I daresay I'm better off not understanding. You actually wanted me to agree to this ... this atrocity ! I actually did, and I actually do. You're an educated woman, graciela. intelligent. Is there any other way to restore ... your family properties ? Santa Anna's administrators rule potosi. You expect me to marry you ... with my father and my four brothers ... newly buried in potosi ? And my husband ? I expect it because it is the logical course. To marry you ? Logical ? Of course. I am acceptable to Santa Anna. And if he should be defeated, i'll manage to become acceptable to his successors. That's the trick ... to be acceptable to the powers that be. Let's not pretend you're a brokenhearted widow. You barely knew the man. The marriage was as much arranged as this one would be. Your family picked him out. That's the way of my people. You'll say yes. It's your only possible path. Like all women, you'll postpone the decision, but you will say yes. Forgive me, ma'am, but I was having a smoke, out on that gallery, and I couldn't help but overhear ... i wasn't eavesdropping, but it rankles me when somebody ... tries to force somebody to do something. You haven't seen me before tonight, but I am offering you my services. If that fella is making you stay in Bexar, i'm ready, willing and able to provide you a transport ... to wherever you want to go. On the other hand, if you choose to stay in Bexar, i'm ready, willing and able, to see that he don't bother you. Would you answer one question with honesty, Mr. Tall American ? Only modesty restrains me from telling you ... that I am widely known for my truthfulness. Would you so quickly offer to defend me ... If I were 60 years old and wrinkled ? Or is it because I am a young and a widow, and you are far from your loved ones ? But ... thank you anyway, sir. In any event, this is a matter ... in which no outsider could help. Mr. Tall American ? I do believe that a woman in trouble, even though 60 and wrinkled, could turn to you for help. Good night, ma'am. Well, thanks, friend. If you don't insist on having them to yourself, i'll give you a hand. Pleasure, friend. You must be jim Bowie. The size and shape is as described, and this knife is everything I heard it was. I'm Bowie. I'm Davy Crockett. Well, i’ve heard a lot about you. I've heard a lot about you, too. I'd admire to buy you a drink or eight or 10. Well ! Excuse me. You have trouble with emil sande ? - Who's emil sande ? - merchant. Tall fella, butter-colored hair ? Yeah, that's him. I've had some words with him. Intend to have more. How about that drink ? Honored, congressman Crockett. Oh, please, jim. Don't call me that. I've been trying to live that down. Here's your extra coat, Davy, and jug. Thoughtful. You better get some sleep, Smitty. I'm not tired. This mexico ... exciting night. You still better get some sleep. All right, Davy. Night, Smitty. Good night, Colonel Bowie ... Jim. Took a long time for this night to get unexciting. It sure did. This is a mighty pretty one, though. I understand you moved down here ... lock, stock, and barrel, jim. I didn't plan on moving. Came for a visit and stayed. I gather you like it. Oh, Davy, if you only knew mexico. It's wonderful. I thought she was a burnt-over desert most of the time. Most northerners think that. It ain't so. Big valleys between high mountains. Just everything a man could want ... in the way of country, for looking at or for growing on. But mostly ... mostly it's the people, Davy. They got, uh ... this is kind of hard to explain, but they got courage, and they got dignity. They ain't afraid to die. But what seems most important to me ... is that they ain't afraid to live. Today is important to them, not the dollar tomorrow might bring. I suppose a yankee says that's lazy. Me, I say it's a way of living. And the womenfolk ... whew ! well, Davy. I figured you favored the mexican ladies. They tell me you married one. Yeah, I ... I did. I ... well, Davy, I just ain't got ... you know, your way of putting things into words. But I got a fine family ... wonderful wife and two fine boys. I guess I'm what you'd call a lucky man. Now that ain't a bad stab at putting it into words. I sent them up to cohuilla, with all the trouble around here. You know, I didn't want to get 'em mixed up ... may I speak privately with you, sir ? Well, sure, but ... you're senorade lopez, aren't you ? Senorbowie. I’m sorry. I did not recognize you at first. Well, senora, this place ain't fit ... I know, but the matter is urgent. Could I have a few private words with this gentleman ? Sure. Excuse me. I'll be inside, Crockett. Crockett ? You are the famous Davy Crockett ? Well, I’m Crockett. They named me Davy after an uncle ... that didn't leave pa the farm after all. Well, Mr. Crockett, shortly after you left my room, I heard an altercation in the street. I could hear the sound though I could not see from my window. It sounded like a drunken brawl. I was sitting right here. I didn't hear a thing. Well, anyway, I saw lights in the old church ... and people moving about. And one of them was emil, and a thought came to me. As you may know, Colonel Travis has ordered ... all powder and ball from the merchants of Bexar. And he didn't find any at emil's warehouse. It's my opinion. It's all hidden ... in the basement of that church. And ... Mr. Crockett, the defenders of Texas ... are going to need that powder against Santa Anna. And you're against Santa Anna ? Bitterly, of course. And this emil, he's for him ? Yes, he is. Then how did he figure you'd marry him ? Political arguments don't flavor folk's supper. Nevertheless, I am going to marry him. And please let's not discuss it, Mr. Crockett. The name is Davy, and I couldn't sleep nights thinking ... will you say goodbye for me to Mr. Bowie ? I can make my own way. And I hope the information is helpful. Something interesting, jim. Parson, round up a couple of the men. Fairly sober, and meet us out in the street. Where are we going ? To church. Yeah, Davy. Parson ! Parson, why'd you run off without me ? I told him to stay. He's drunk. Oh, stick to the point ! Why'd you run off without me. Jim, this is Beekeeper. Jim Bowie. You can come, but hold your breath, can they smell, they'll be warned you're coming. Excuse me. Grab that torch. Excuse me. Well. Here, Parson. Yes, sir. Rifles ! Must be 50 of them ! That's gunpowder. Let me take a look at that stuff. - Watch it ! - stand back and stand still ! Excuse me. There must be a ton of it. I'm sure gonna be looking forward to seeing that soldier boy's face ... when we bring this in. It's a beautiful morning, Davy Crockett. It is that, maria de lopez y vejar. My goodness, you remember all that ? Sure. I'm not as stupid as I look from the outside. What's Spanish for "breakfast" ? Desayuno. Well, let's take a paseadoout and get some desayuno. Paseado ? That means "walk." That means "have walked." But never mind, i’ll get dressed. Wait a minute. First write me a letter. A letter ? In spanish. Of course. To whom is the letter addressed ? To the honorable Davy Crockett, esquire. You wish a letter written to yourself ? To the honorable Davy Crockett, esquire, former congressman of the united states of america. Esteemed sir ... let's go ! Hurry it up there ! You seen Davy ? Ain't nobody seen Davy. He ain't about. First lie you told today, thimblerig. Morning, Davy. Howdy. Say Davy, what kind of a load you got there ? Presents for some friends. Let's go, Parson ! Get up. Halt ! Who goes there ? Is that you, bob ? Why sure ! Can't you see ? Then what kind of idiot nonsense ... is this "who goes there ?" Well, Travis ... Colonel Travis, this is, - He says that is should ... - I don't care what Travis said. Open that gate before I shoot you off that wall. Sentry, Open the gate for Colonel Bowie. Near a ton of good powder here, men. Get it unloaded. That long one there, he's Davy Crockett, and three of his good men. Colonel Crockett. Hello Travis. Looks like the answer to a prayer. Colonel, I'd be pleased if you join me ... in my quarters for some refreshment. Proud to. Oh, and you too, Colonel Bowie, if you will. I'm a stranger around these here parts. What do you Texicans use for drinking whiskey ? Drinking whiskey. Well, you got manners, or ain't you ? Captain Dickinson, this is Colonel Davy Crockett. - Pleased, sir. - How do you do ? And this is my cousin, Mrs. Dickinson. Colonel Crockett. - Colonel Bowie. - Hello, sue. Well, it's nice meeting you, Davy Crockett. I feel as if I know you already. You see, part of my family come from Tennessee. And, well, your name is a household word there. At least in our house it was. Well, thank you, ma'am. It's nice to be well thought of. Oh, yes, darling. I've asked you not to climb those stairs alone. Well, who's this ? You say hello to Colonel Crockett. Hello. Every size they get to seems to be the most lovable. Will you gentlemen excuse me ? Goodbye, Colonel. Goodbye. Kind of a shame kids have to grow up into people. It's good we're all here, gentlemen. Cigar ? Please make yourselves comfortable. I have some news. Fannin is doing well at goliad. He has mustered almost 1,000 men ... and should be ready to move south by the first of the week. A thousand ? It don't seem possible. It does sound too good to be true, I must confess. But we can only admit our doubts to each other. In the privacy of a room and not in front of the men. As far as the volunteers are concerned, we'll be sure, that Fannin has 1,000 men, or more. I got a reputation for truth, Travis. I ain't. Everybody says I’m a born liar, but whether we talk out loud or quiet, don't seem to me the point right now. Point is, how many men has Fannin, and will he get here in time ? Whether he does or doesn't, we'll be trapped here. And for no reason. What we should do is burn all of Bexar, including this mission, and fight a harassing action ? Annoy Santa Anna while he sweeps north across the whole of Texas ? That's Colonel Bowie's theory, Colonel Crockett, and I cannot entertain the idea ! We could hit and run, jumping at every creek crossing between ... - you seem to forget one thing, Colonel Bowie. - What ? That I command ! And I have already decided against your plan. Now, let us attack a more important problem. Colonel Crockett's Tennesseans. Will they fight, Colonel ? Up to the last time I saw 'em ... they hadn't shown any strong feelings against fighting. But can you persuade your men to come into this mission ? I can ask them. And you're a very persuasive man, according to your reputation. Build up the story that Fannin has 1,000 ... no ! 2,000 men. Play down the size of Santa Anna's army ... hold it, Travis, we've been all through this. He wants me to lie to my men, too. Keep 'em here with lies. Let Santa Anna's strength be known down there in the yards, and by daybreak, there won't be a baker's dozen left ! You calling my boys cowards ? Let us dispense with fire-eater's pyrotechnics, Colonel Bowie ! Just remember this, Travis, my men are all volunteers. They're here because they wAnna be. But there's nothing to keep them from packing up and getting out of here ! I'm aware that your men are militia. And like all volunteers, undisciplined. Good day, Colonel Bowie. Last night gave you a pretty good idea ... of the discipline of my men. Our position here is desperate. And I feel sure that where Crockett leads, his men will follow. That's a responsibility that's been kind of worrying me. Thank you, gentlemen. I'm going to pass the word around ... what you Texans use for drinking whiskey ... is drinking whiskey. And what's more important, you've got real good manners. Seeing as how you're suffering the handicap of having never been in Tennessee. Hey, Davy, is it true that you fit a four-day fight with mike fink ? Why, that's a blasted lie, one of them stories loose-mouthed people tell around. Mike and me quit at sundown. Wouldn't have been the fourth day until, next morning. See you, men. Let her rip, Parson ! Senoralopez. Don juan, this is Mr. Davy Crockett. - I'm honored. - How do you do ? Senorseguin is the alcalde ... I mean the mayor of San Antonio de Bexar. Well, he's got a pretty busy town. The people are running like sheep that have smelled a wolf pack. I never said no such a thing. When I stuck that powder in there, that fella Travis asked if us Tennesseans ... was gonna join up with him. That's all. He never asked us to fight his fight for him. Have some breakfast. Breakfast ? Tortillas ? Tamales. Never get burnt drinking this stuff. Well, I own me no part of this here Texas, and none of these here Texicans is related to me. So why should I fight for them ? Right. Ain't our ox's that're gettin' gored. Talking about whose ox gets gored, figure this, fella gets in the habit of goring oxes, whets his appetite. He may come up north next and gore yours. Men, We're In A Little Fix, Sort Of. The He-Bull Around Here, General Santa Anna, he's mad at us. He's Wrote Us A Letter. Now, I Can't Read It, It's In Spanish. But The Young Lady Will. ”It Is Addressed To Davy Crockett, and The Tennesseans Who Accompany Him. Be It Known, you are interlopers in a country ... where you are neither wanted nor welcome. This Is The Order You Are Given, depart with all haste and at once, because it has come to our attention ... that you are possibly considering ... joining the rebels now skulking in the mission. This Is Not Your Fight. Depart. Should You Fail To Abide By This Order, I shall chastise you, even unto death. Signed, Generalissimo Antonio Miguel de Santa Anna." Fella Kind Of Fancies Himself, Don't He ? Sure Does Have A Big-Sounding Name. Giving Us Orders ? Who Do He Think He Am, andy-by-god-jackson ? Riles Me When Somebody Tells Me ... to go here or I can't go there. I Never Been Run Out Of No Place ! Except The Time My Old Pa kicked me over every acre ... of that half section back there in ohio. But I Was A Short-Tailed Kid Then. My Pa Had Big Feet. Well, What Do You Say, Davy ? We Going To Let This Man Tell Us what we can or can't do ? Davy, Maybe We'd Better Saddle Up and pay this fella a visit. Do Chastise Mean What I Think It Do ? It Do. Davy, Let's Do Saddle Up, and go learn that gentleman his manners. We Won't Have To. he's wearing out horses coming toward us. Guess we Can't Stop Him From Coming, but I reckon we can arrange for him to limp going back. I Swear, I Was Beginning To Think These Texicans ... wasn't as neighborly as they might be, but here they'd gone and arranged a nice fight for us visitors. One Thing I Ought To Tell You, Santa Anna never wrote that letter ... I Did. Rather, I Had This Lady Here Write It. I Was Figuring How To Tell You Fellas about this texican hoedown, and then I wondered what Santa Anna would've said to us Tennesseans ... if he'd had a chance to say it. Davy, I Ain't Never Said I Ain't Been Whupped. I Have, But I Give Each And every one of 'em fellas a chance ... to dig in and get the job done. But I Ain't Never Took Nobody's word that they gonna chaste ... Chastise ! Chastise ! Much Obliged. Well, Speak Up, Davy, we're gonna stay, ain't we ? Well, I’m Thinking It Over. - Thinkin' It ... - What's There To Think About ? You Getting That Old ? Man Told To Mark Dead Us ? Chastise, He Said. That's Right. Chastise. But I Wrote The Letter ! Now Don't You Start Weaseling. You Said Yourself Them Would Be the very words he'd write to us, Even If He Was To Write Us A Letter ! Well, Gentlemen, You've Convinced Me. We'll Fight. That's More Like It. Now You're Talkin', Davy ! But First, The Young Lady and I will take a pasear. Gather Up Your Possibles And I'll meet up with you later. Right, Davy ! Con Permiso ? Your Spanish Is Improving. Kind Of Cheers Me To See The Colonel with that lady. Last Couple Of Years He Had Me Worried. Lately He Ain't Been Looking At the girls like he was starved. Being In Congress Has ruined many a good man. All I Hear Is Crockett The Bear-Killer, Crockett the indian-fighter, Crockett the brawler. Crockett Has Brains. Kept It Hidden A Number Of Years. You Like My Tennesseans, Flaca ? Yes. You Could Strain 10,000 And Never come up with 23 better. Every One Of Those Men has been at my elbow, save the boy Smitty, when some difficulty arose. Some Of Them Don't Bathe As Often As polite folks would think necessary. But Every One Of Them Smells Sweet To Me. And I Was The One That Said This country was burnt-over sand. It's Green And Growing, like those green pastures they talk about. Lord Above, that's one beautiful tree. This Tree Must Have Been Growed Before ... man put his first dirty footprints on this prairie. Kind of a tree adam and eve must've met under. You know something, flaca ? I guess I saw who knows how many trees ... before I ever took a long, thoughtful look at one. Mostly, I looked at a tree to see was there a ... bear in it or an indian behind it. Davy, what's going to happen to us ? I mean ... to you and me. I'm gonna tell you something, flaca, and I want you to listen tight. It may sound like I'm talking about me, but I’m not, I'm talking about you. As a matter of fact, I’m talking about all people, everywhere. When I come down here to Texas, I was looking for something. I didn't know what. It seems like you added up my life, and I’d spent it all either stomping other men ... or, in some cases, getting stomped. Had me some money and had me some medals, but none of it seemed a lifetime worth ... the pain of the mother that bore me. It was like I was empty. Well, I’m not empty anymore. That's what's important, to feel useful in this old world. Hit a lick against what's wrong ... or to say a word for what's right, even though you get walloped for saying that word. Now, I may sound like a bible-beater ... yelling up a revival at a river crossing camp meeting. But that don't change the truth none. There's right, and there's wrong. You got to do one or the other. Do the one, and you're living. You do the other, and you may be walking around, but you're dead as a beaver hat. I'd hoped for a horse, but there's nothing wrong with a good strong mule. My things. All my luggage is in the buggy. Had my men take care of it. Your jeejaws may be rough-packed, but they're all there. You are sending me away. You ... you talked about the fight against evil, but you ... you are sending me to safety. Flaca, you have an important name. You know a million words and how they should be used. I'm sending you to fight your war, to talk up a howling mob. I'll stay here and hit a lick. I hope you can drive a mule. His name's jesus, they told me. He seems a good, honest mule. Maybe i'll never see you again. If that's what's written, that's what's written. When it's time, it's time. Talking only makes it the harder, flaca, so stir up that mule. Davy, I ... you never pray, do you, Davy ? I never found the time. Sir, the Tennesseans. Colonel Travis. Crockett and his men. - Go down and open the gate. - I'll just holler down. Your orders were to go down, not holler down, Mr. denison. Yes, sir. Crack shots, those Tennesseans. Twenty times their number's what we need, and more. I’m sorry, Will. Such gloomy remarks are for your ears alone. Isn't that Bowie galloping up there to catch him ? I can just hear him pleading his cause. Crockett seems to me the type of man that would choose Bowie. What you mean is Crockett isn't the type of man to choose me. Oh, will. Depend on you to say it the most brutal way. Most facts are brutal. Just look at that great knife fighter yapping at Crockett. "Cut, slash, and run." Let's get mounted. "Cut, slash, and run." Cut, slash, and run. It'd cost Santa Anna 50 or 100 troops ... at every creek crossing between here and the north. Sounds reasonable the way you put it, jim, but Travis, he's got a point, too. It takes thinkin' on. Hey, jim ! Halt ! Who goes there ? Bob, I swear I’m going to shoot you off that wall ! You blind ? That's what I was told to holler every time. Well, don't holler at me ! Idiot. You think on it, Davy. You'll side with me. What is it ? Tennesseans, nell. 23 of them, all the way from home. Do you recognize any of them, Jacko ? Could be my brother Malachi's with them. Oh, he was a considerable fella to go where there was trouble. Oh, he was that. But, nell, you know Malachi was hung, or so some folks told us. Colonel Crockett, I'm glad you were able to persuade your men to join us. Well, they insisted, sort of. Our heartiest welcome. Ladies and gentlemen, we are proud to welcome these patriotic men ... who have traveled 1,500 miles to join us in our hour of need ! - Sergeant Lightfoot ? - yes, sir ? Have your men raise a cheer ... for our gallant allies ... from the illustrious state of Tennessee ! Yes, sir ! Captain, you will attend to the billeting of these men. After you are quartered, gentlemen, I will take you on a tour of the emplacements. this way, gentlemen. Crockett ? Davy Crockett ? We're from Tennessee. Howdy, folks. We seen you when you came to stink wells, to speak about that job from congress. You shook hands with me. I'll do her again. He didn't vote for you, though. Other fella gave him four bits. I'm sorry. Don't be. I'm glad there were enough sensible folks like you to vote me out of that job. Later on, we'll have a real old home talkfest, but we've got to get quartered and bedded down. Will you excuse us ? You should've voted for him, jocko. Cuidado ! Cuidado ! Cuidado ! Cuidado ! Cuidado ! Cuidado ! Columna, a la izquierda ! Of our 24 pieces of ordnance, five are these six-pounders. Something's stirring in town ! Ladies will take cover, please. Men, to your battle positions ! Captain Dickinson ? Are your men disposed ? At their posts, sir. No one will fire unless I so order ! Those people are under the protection of a flag of truce ! "from the headquarters of Generalissimo Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, absolute ruler of mexico, to the rebel commander who deems himself in command ... of the rebels occupying the mission. be it known, the province of mexico known as Texas ... has shown itself to be an active ... in treasonous revolt against the rule of Generalissimo Santa Anna. the Generalissimo, in his kindness, issues the following order. all occupants of the mission will leave at once, leaving all arms and ammunition behind. if this order is not followed with dispatch, the Generalissimo will reduce the mission by assault. there will be no quarter given." Well, what do you think, jim ? I hate to say anything good about that long-winded jackanapes. But he does know the short way to start a war. The sixth. The sixth veracruzana fusiliers. They're bivouacking about a mile south of our west bastion. Light artillery, lancers, some engineers. Not one unit of heavy assault troops has arrived yet, and it still adds up to 2,000 men. That'll be to our advantage, Dick. That main body must be strung out for miles. The assault infantry, heavy artillery, commissary and supply trains, they won't be here for four or five days. And the actual battle can't start until then. Or, there'll be occasional sortie or artillery fire feeling out our defenses. They won't commit themselves to an act of attack ... until Santa Anna is here with his main force. - Then what ? - Then Fannin will be here. More troops arriving every hour. Prettiest army I ever did see. If I take my men out, do you go with me ? Davy, you know this old mission can't stand up in front of Santa Anna's army. My way's the only way. Travis says that Fannin's coming. "Travis says" ! I wouldn't take Travis' word ... that night's dark and day's light. Blowing on the horn, that's all. Chicken in the breadpan, pickin' up the corn, that's all. Flies in the buttermilk, shoo, fly, shoo. that's all. Ants in the sugar bowl, two by two, that's all. I carried twice as much. You're twice as big. Patrol's in trouble ! Doggone it, Beekeeper, I thought you wasn't going to open that corn liquor till nightfall ! What's the matter with you ? It's only a half-hour till dark. Besides, it's my keg, ain't it ? Well, all right. Give me some of that stuff. I'm so scared, I could drink all of it. Maybe I will. What'd you see, irish ? More than I wanted to, jim. Lot of men arriving. They got the durn-blastedest cannon ever I did see ! Something like this. Twelve or 14-foot long, maybe. He sure draws pretty, don't he ? Frightening. Twelve, 14-feet long ? Are you sure, irish ? - well, yeah, I ... - Finn ! Yes, sir ! You were ordered to report to me, not to hold lecture courses. Get up here ! All right, will ... Colonel Travis. Hey, Travis ! With a cannon like that, them Santa Anna fellas can sit out there, and give us what for, can't they ? There's no such cannon in the north American continent. But they have some in europe, according to last reports. Acting Lieutenant Finn is exaggerating. She's a big one, Davy, and she's shooting from over here ! Battery one ! Is your gun ready ? We're primed and ready, sir. Give it full elevation ! Yes, sir ! The gun is ready, sir ! Fire ! Kind of short there, Colonel Mr. Travis ! I sure I’m glad I seen that there cannon sitting out there on that prairie. For a minute, I thought they was shooting at us from one of 'em old country's ... way over in europe. Oh, my goodness. No ! Oh, no ! They wouldn't dare ! Man, that ain't no fair way to fight a war ! Well, I guess we better do something about that, Crockett. Plain as can be. About an hour after dark ? Good. Thimblerig ... fifteen men, right after dark. all sober. - Boo ! - Halt ! I lost the bet. I bet some of my friends I could sneak up on you without you hearing me. Friend, you like to got a hole ... tie him loose. Kick that fire out and kill our silhouette. - Let's go ! Over the wall ! - let's go ! - Everything set ? - yes, sir. All right. It's time, men. Open the gate. Colonel Travis ! Sentry here ! - Somebody jumped him ! - I'll say they did ! Throwed me down, tied me up, and some of them stepped on me going by, and never so much as a by-your-leave from every one of 'em. Damn it ! - Return to your posts. - yes, sir. Close the gate ! Well, you better get your men mounted then. See if you can give them any help. Yes, sir. Detail ... stand ahorse. Get the powder ! - Where's the mud ? - it's coming. Here it is. Clear out ! I'll cover ! You heard the man ! - Go on, kid, get out of here ! - I can shoot. Golly, what a gun ! Go on ! Grab a horse ! Cover party ! No one will fire until you can identify your target ! Yes, sir ! Let's give them a hand, boys ! Knock on it ! Pick 'em up ! Pick 'em up ! Everybody rides double ! Come on ! Pick 'em up ! Open the gate ! Open the gate ! Hold the gate ! Somebody's still outside ! Close the gate ! Good work, Smitty. We never missed you, jim, it's a good thing the kid did. That horse folded with me. - You all right, jim ? - yeah, sure. Mr. Smith, you've been hurt ! It's all right. Let's take a look at that. - I tell ya, it's all right. - Doctor ! No bones broken. All you need is a little Dr. Beekeeper's Fixum. See ? I ... pretty close. Bowie ? Oh, he's all right. Turned a horse over. - Jethro ? - Yes, sir ? Tell Colonel Bowie I wish to speak to him at once. Yes, sir. Over here, where we can have a little privacy. Yes, sir. - Post this area. - yes, sir. Will, considering the way things turned out ... Dick, leave this to me. Colonel Bowie, i've had just about enough insubordination. You have ? All right, let's get to it. When and where ? I hear you're a good shot, so let's choose pistols. I'd assumed you would've chosen the ruffian's ... gentlemen, I beg ... Dick, act for me. Time. I suggest after this war is over. Yes. The minute. The very minute this war is over. Jim ? That's fine with me. One last word, Bowie. This evening's episode, by going on a mission without orders, you endangered this command. If it had not been for the fortunate intervention ... of captain Dickinson and his patrol, a large number of badly needed volunteers ... would now be dead out there instead of at their posts in here ! I demand your word of honor that there will be no repetition of such conduct. Otherwise, I shall order your arrest. Travis ... don't you worry anymore about arrest or insubordination. I take my people out at daybreak. Colonel Travis, I’m an old man, but you're wrong ! That Jethro. Reminds me of a story ... please, Crockett ! No homespun wisdom. No cracker-barrel philosophy. None of the backwoods wit for which you are famous. Good night. You better slack off on me, mister. This code-of-honor business doesn't bother me a bit. When there's trouble, i come from any direction ... as sudden and surprising as I can. My only concern here is 23 Tennesseans, so you better let me know what's in your mind. I'd have thought that would have been obvious to you. It's as simple as this. There's Santa Anna with 7,000 men. Up here is the sabine river. Somewhere around here, Sam Houston is trying to organize an army. And right in between ... is the Alamo. Santa Anna can't go around, and leave a fort along his lines of communication. He must reduce the Alamo by storm. Every minute we buy for Sam Houston ... is another precious minute in the life of Texas. And, Crockett, nobody is ever going to say that william barrett Travis ... did not buy every minute possible. Makes sense. Why didn't you tell Bowie that ? Because a commander does not have to explain his every decision. You explained to me. I have great respect for you, Crockett, but I have none for that knife-fighting adventurer. I figured any fella that shouldered a gun was deserving of respect. But then, I’m not a real soldier. I never fought anybody but Indians. Lessen you count the british. Crockett. I must ask you to forgive my rudeness earlier on to you. I'm an easy forgiver ... at times. Good night, Travis. Crack out a couple of jugs, and bring that guitar. What are we going to do, Davy ? Serenade. Well, I hope you told that long-winded idiot what you think of him. Well, I’m not rightly sure what I think of him. What's all this ? I figured we'd crack a jug, and tell each other our troubles. Now, wait a minute, Crockett, don't try your winning ways on me. My mind's made up. Well, we can have a farewell drink. You mean, you're staying ? That's what I figure, jim. All right, we'll have a drink or two or ten, but you ain't gonna get me drunk and change my mind ! Of course not. Morning patrol ! Let's go ! Rise and shine ! Up and at 'em ! Beekeeper ! Come on, show a leg ! Thimblerig ! Come on ! It's your duty ! - Your duty ! - Shut up ! You don't have to wake us all ! I'll get them up, Sergeant. Thanks, Parson. Thanks. Hey, brown. $2, American, if you take out my patrol. $2 ? This morning, I wouldn't take your patrol for 10. I would ! Got yourself a deal, scotty. Well, Davy, it looks like you done it again. It do. Bowie ? Looked like a tie to me. "Your duty." Good morning, Colonel. He's still a-sleepin'. I'll take care of that, Jethro. Crockett ! Crockett ! Crockett, what the devil ... good morning, Smitty. Doc. Davy. Good morning. Well, you got yourself famous last night. Now every place they talk about jim Bowie, they'll have to tell about the good man that pulled him out from under the troops. Gee, will they ? Jim, the kid's always wanted to know about that sandbar episode. - Oh, come on, Crockett. - well, that's the truth. He's never heard anything but hearsay. Gosh, yes, Mr. Bowie. All the fellas back home talk about that ... by the way, Smitty, say goodbye to jim. You going someplace, Colonel ... Jim ? No. No, I’m not going no place. That's just Crockett's idea of a joke. Now, you get well, Smitty boy. And thanks for your help. Well, what are you doing ? It was rumored we were leaving this morning. I'll tell you when we're leaving. Get that gear put away ! Crockett. By god, Bowie, you're bad-tempered. Now don't ever try to make a fool out of me again. - Once is enough ! - I make up my own mind. Never thought otherwise, jim. I was wondering, do you think there'd be a mouthful of that corn juice left ? We could cut the tar out of our throats. That's a great idea, Davy. That's a great idea. I still say you're bad-tempered. Amigo ! Halt ! Who goes there ? Don't shoot, amigo. A message for jim Bowie. In the Sombrero. jim ? Fella says there's a message in this hat for you. Kind of a strange way to be sending messages, ain't it ? Maybe Santa Anna's surrendered. What is it, jim ? I never knew the night could be so dark. My wife ... she ... she's dead. I lived through it, jim. It's hard. It was the plague. The damn plague. Oh, god, dear god. Oh, Davy, she ... she was so small. So tiny, so very tiny. She wanted to stay in Bexar to be near me, but I made her go to cohuilla. I made her go ! My man Parson ... kind of a preacher ... he keeps saying ... "little do we mortals know." Hold your head up, jim. Colonel Bowie. You've had a communication from outside these walls. This is against my orders. What information have you received ? Bowie, hand me that letter ! You may die tonight. The little lady, jim. She won't like it. Colonel Bowie, Please accept my most profound sympathy, and my regret for having disturbed you at such a moment. This in no way impairs your right to call me ... on the field of honor at a later date. But I wish to express my sorrow for you. And present my apology for being such a boor at such a time. Travis ... you can't help being you, and I can't help being me. What's that all about, Sergeant ? Thirty-two cases hospitalized this morning, sir. Well, tell them to move over. After last night's party, I ... oh, no, sir. Women and children. Another officers' call. See for yourself. It's all like that. Sir ? Gentlemen. Doctor. It's as simple as this, gentlemen. I had 32 cases of mild dysentery this morning. I tested the salt pork barrel the rations were rationed from, it's tainted. So is every other barrel in the warehouse. Sergeant. Barring the pork, I figure we have three or four days' full rations ... to serve to the Garrison. You see the dilemma, gentlemen. We are almost out of food. However, Santa Anna does not suffer under the same handicap. Therefore, our course is obvious. If you'll follow me. I can think of more comfortable places ... to watch that show from. Quiet. Dick. Yes, sir ? It's a half-hour till daybreak. Have your men stand ahorse. Yes, sir. The night herders, two to each one of them and don't miss. There'll be a lot of hungry kids. Get going. Smitty. Grab a horse off that picket line for Smitty. Get a good one. Colonel Davy ? Can I ask you fellas something face to face ? Sure thing, kid. You really sending me because I’m a good horseman, like you said ? As I live and breathe. You're smarter than the Beekeeper, and you can swim better than the gambler. It ain't because you don't think ... i'd be worth my salt when the fighting starts ? Smitty, let me tell you something. Of all the men in this outfit, i'd pick you to side me, if the going was rough. - You see ? - Gee. Get on this horse. Now, there's nothing out there, kid, but dark. Good luck, Smitty. It'll take him quite a few days to get to Houston. That's what I figured. South side's all taken care of. Get a horse. Now all we can do is wait. That's the hardest part. It sure is. Halt. Carry on, Dick. Good luck. Thank you, will. Best of luck, Dickinson. Forward, go. If they don't shoot pretty quick, we've got to go anyway. Let's take them ! Hold your fire. Hold your fire. Pick your targets. Fire ! Fire at will ! Second rank, fire ! Fall back. Fire ! Fall back. Fire ! Fall back. Second rank. Fire ! Fall back. Third rank. Ready. Fire. Cease fire. Close the gate. There's one thing for sure. He's a bearcat for nerve. I'm grateful for that. I'd hate to look at a coward. Over a duel and pistol. You're not much for this ... forgive-and-forget business, are you, jim ? No. Meat for supper. Yes, sir. Hog never rightly could pass for meat, but beef ... Davy ! Santa Anna, the big he-bull himself. Let's go. Ladies, to cover. Men, to your posts. Captain Dickinson. Yes, sir. Order all men fed in relays, - full issue of ammunition. - Yes, sir. That's the best-dressed army I ever saw. Fancy clothes don't make a fighting man. They're just off two years, putting down revolts. They're fighting men. "Generalissimo Santa Anna has just arrived ... with the main body of his army, and has only now become aware ... that there are women and children in the mission. he wishes that the ladies receive his apologies, and be informed ... his forces have never attacked a position ... without the enemy being given the opportunity ... to evacuate women and children. accordingly, you have one hour ... in which to evacuate these noncombatants, who will be provided with transport to proceed ... to such destination as is their choice. signed, antonio lopez de Santa Anna, ruler of mexico." Your answer ? My compliments to the General for his gallantry. We will evacuate our noncombatants. Single men will remain at their posts ! Married men will arrange transport for their families ! Sue. - You better hurry. - She won't go. Save your breath, will, your ever so persuasive breath. All right. Say it. It's a sorry man that can't make his wife obey. You seem to forget, Dick, that I, too, am married. I've got to do what I think is the right thing. I'm a soldier's wife. My child is a soldier's child. We'll stay. Very well, sue. Dick. Don't be angry with me. I'm not angry. I'm proud. Dick, take your patrol. Yes, sir. Married men, return to your posts ! Open the gate ! Captain Dickinson. Escort, forward, yo ! Ma'am, I ain't got no woman. To say goodbye to. Could I tell you goodbye ? Surely. Jocko, nell, it's time. Go on, jocko. Do the best you can. I can't. I can't. I just can't do it, fellas. Colonel Bowie, this is a request and not an order. But I suggest that as desperate as our needs are, that family's needs are more desperate. Get in that line, jocko, and move out with your people. You can see how it is. It's more than a man can bear. She's never said a word of pity for herself ... in the 10 years she's been blind. Will Travis, who do you think you are ? Mrs. Robertson, I can assure you that ... no blame will attach itself to your husband. Get moving, jocko, or I’ll help you along with a toe of my boot. Shut up, jim Bowie. And you and Travis, listen close. My man ain't going out. He's just as much a man ... as either one of you amd maybe more. In spite of he ain't rich like you, jim, or fancy educated like you, will Travis. Jocko, you get back up on that wall, because you're just as good as any man ... that ever trod leather, and it's your right. And I can't see, but I’m just as good as any woman in Texas. And it's my right to go and leave you. Now we've cuddled nice and said all our goodbyes, but I’ll say it again. We'd be fools not to face it. You're likely to go and get yourself ... killed in this battle. And I don't know what you're going to say ... going through the gates of heaven, but I’m going to say that no woman ever lived ... had a better husband than you've been to me. Now go on. Captain Dickinson. Yes, sir. Have the doctor set up the hospital in the chapel. You will personally take charge of battery number four. Yes, sir. Adelante ! Hold your fire. Hold your fire. Take them ! Straight, frontal attack. We need more men up here. I'll get some from Dickinson. Front wall ! Hurry it up ! - Ho ! - it's the Parson. Clarines, Suenen el Retiro ! Hold your fire. Hold your fire ! They're retiring. Stretcher bearer ! See did any of our boys get hurt. I'll be below, getting washed on the outside, And wet down inside. We've been lucky today. Check the damage. Officers' call in 10 minutes. Bring on another. Sure killed many a brave man today. It's funny, I was proud of them. Even while I was killing them, i was proud of them. It speaks well for men ... that so many ain't afraid to die ... 'cause they think Right's on their side. Speaks well. Post this area, Lightfoot. Beg pardon, sir, it's already done. All right, Sergeant. Report. Fifty casualties, twenty-eight dead, 22 wounded. Morale high. Well, morale ain't gonna help us much ... if Fannin don't get here and quick. Ow, Doc ! Quit squawking. You ought to be laying on your back. You'll never walk. Santa Anna didn't have much respect for us today. He got burned. Yeah, now he's gonna be coming at us with a battle plan ... from all four sides. We've already been cut down by a third. Just how long do you think we can hold out ? Santa Anna won't attack again today. He'll clear the field of all the dead and wounded. We know that Fannin will be here by tomorrow, even without a forced march. With his 500 men, we can hold this fort for at least a month. Five hundred ? I thought it was 1,000. Five hundred. Bonham's approaching, sir. Good. Fannin should be close behind. Well ? Colonel Fannin isn't coming. His men were ambushed, murdered ! There won't be any help. Have all volunteers assembled in the compound. Well, that's it. I'm taking my men out, cut through to the north. You coming ? Seems like the better part of valor. Men ... jim Bonham has brought news as sad as death. Colonel Fannin has been ambushed. We can expect no help. I stay here with my command, but any of you who wish to ... may leave with all honor. Failing reinforcements, the Alamo cannot hold. But do not go with heads hung low. No man can criticize your behavior. Here on these ramparts, you have bought a priceless 10 days of time for Houston. You have bled the enemy army. You are brave and noble soldiers. Open the gate ! May god bless you. Close the gate ! Hold up there, bub. You're getting into dangerous territory. Where you heading ? I'm looking for General Sam Houston. Got a message for him. You've come to the right place. Corporal of the guard, post number three ! - What is it ? - He wants to see General Sam. Come on, bub. Man has a message for the General. Yes, sir. Well, you better get down, son. And get yourself some frijole beans, and a little sleep. No, sir ! I've got to get back to the Alamo ! Yesterday I read you Colonel Fannin's message ... telling us he cannot reach the Alamo in time. Today I have this, from the Alamo. They are surrounded, and we can't help them. Now, tomorrow, when your recruits start to whine and bellyache, you tell them ... that 185 of their friends, neighbors, fellow Texicans, are holed up in a crumbling adobe church ... down on the rio bravo, buying them this precious time. I hope they remember. I hope Texas remembers. ♪ A time to be reapin' ♪ ♪ A time to be sowin' ♪ ♪ The green leaves of summer ♪ ♪ are callin' me home ♪ ♪ It was good to be young then ♪ in the season of plenty ♪ ♪ When the catfish were jumpin' ... ♪ It may not be as comfortable, but it's safer in here.

'cause you want to believe in the good things about man, about his very own self, the real good things, like courage, and honesty, and love. Jethro ? Yes, sir ? This is something I promised Mrs. Bowie. - Know what it is ? - No, sir. That's your freedom. You're a free man, jeth. Thank you, sir. You better get your belongings together, get on over the wall tonight. It's going to be more than a little rough around here. Good luck, jeth. Thank you, sir. Colonel Bowie, you say I’m a free man ? That's right. Well, if I’m free, then I got a right to decide, what I’m going to do. Seems to me, that's what you men are fighting for. So I reckon i’ll ... I'll stay. Look ! Gentlemen, good luck. Get to your battle stations. What's that ? It's sure a lot. A la Carga ! Adelante ! Adelante ! Get Bowie out of here. Get him into the chapel ! Yes, sir. - I'm all right. - Hold still, Colonel Bowie. - I said, I’m all right. - Colonel Crockett says ... don't start that ... battery number three, come on ! Get to the infirmary. Fire ! Crockett. Crockett ! North wall. Half of you men, throw up a barricade here. Throw up a barricade ! You try it the front wall. Adelante ! Adelante ! Does this mean what I think it do ? It do.
