(thunder cracking) (suspenseful music) (thunder cracking) (suspenseful music) (engine rumbling) (suspenseful music continues) (thunder cracking) - We better get the top up. - Thunder and lightning scares me. Does it always storm this hard up here? - This is a mild one, Laura. But you can stop worrying. We'll be leaving on that trip in a few days. - I can hardly wait. I always had a terrific yearn to see Africa. What's it really like, I mean, hunting and capturing animals? - This is no time to discuss Africa. You get out and help me with this top. - Well, now, what do I do, great white hunter? - Unsnap that cover. (thunder rumbling) And quick or we'll get soaked. (thunder cracking) - You know, this is hardly the honeymoon I dreamed of. - Like I say, marry them, lead them out in the middle of nowhere, take their shoes away, and you've got a wife that'll do very nicely. - So you think you'll keep me? - You try and get away. That marriage license cost me six bucks. You know, I can buy six wives for that in the middle of Africa. - Well, I hope you still feel that way when we get in the jungle. - Shall I prove it? - Now, what do you think? (birds chirping) I love you. - I think we better get home. - I think so, too. (thunder rumbling) Beautiful out here. - Beautiful, but dangerous. We killed a panther up here last year. Killed a horse before we got him. - Oh, animals don't frighten me. I had a pet monkey when I was a little girl. He loved me, but hated everybody else. - That sounds like Spanky, a gorilla I brought back. - Gorilla? - I captured him as a baby. He was all right till he grew up. Have to keep him caged now. He goes to the zoo next week. (tense music) (thunder rumbling) We better head for home. These roads are a mess when it rains. Wouldn't be very pleasant to be bogged down out here. - [Both] Especially on our wedding night. (both chuckle) (tense music continues) (engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) (thunder cracking) - [Laura] Amazing, a mansion in the middle of nowhere. Do you think we'll find room for our 10 children? - They're cheaper by the dozen. (both chuckle) (suspenseful music) (thunder rumbling) Just made it. - Close the door, the rain is coming in. (suspenseful music continues) (thunder cracking) This is quite a menagerie. Ooh, it's chilly in here. - This'll warm you up. (thunder rumbling) Come and get it. (thunder cracking) - I'd rather have coffee. Where's your house boy? - Taro? I told him to feed Spanky and take the night off. I thought we'd want to be alone. (dramatic music) (thunder rumbling) (Spanky growls) (tense music) - What's that? - Spanky sounds like he's mad about something. - He's in the house? - [Dan] He's in the cellar. - Well, isn't that dangerous? - [Dan] Oh, he's caged. (tense music) - I'd like to see him. - Now? - Why not? - Why not. (thunder rumbling) (tense music) (suspenseful music) (thunder cracking) (suspenseful music continues) - He's beautiful. - That's the first time I've heard him referred to as being beautiful. - Can we go a little closer? - Sure. (tense music) - He's fascinating. - Don't get too close, he's dangerous. (tense music) (Spanky growls) Maybe some food will quiet him down. (intrigued music) (Spanky snuffling) (thunder cracking) Spanky! (Spanky growls) (suspenseful music) - Spanky. (Spanky snuffling) You're hurting my wrist. You don't want to hurt me. (intrigued music) Spanky, let go of me. (suspenseful music) - Don't ever get that close to him again. He could have killed you. (Spanky growls) (tense music) Laura? Laura, let's go. (Spanky snorts) (tense music continues) (thunder cracking) (tense music continues) (Spanky growls) (tense music continues) (furniture clattering) (Spanky growls) (suspenseful music) (Spanky growls) (thunder cracking) (thunder rumbling) (thunder cracking) (romantic music) (suspenseful music) (Spanky growls) - Do you think Spanky's afraid of the storm? - Never was before. (Spanky growls) (suspenseful music) Let's forget about Spanky. I always wanted to carry my bride across the threshold. (Dan chuckles) (Spanky snorts) (romantic music) (suspenseful music) (Spanky growls) (thunder cracking) (thunder rumbling) (dramatic music) (Spanky growls) (dramatic music continues) (Spanky growls) (tense music) (thunder cracking) (tense music continues) (Spanky growls) (thunder cracking) (suspenseful music) (tense music) (thunder rumbling) (Spanky groans) (tense music) (stairs thumping) (tense music continues) (thunder rumbling) (suspenseful music) (tense music) (door creaking) (thunder rumbling) (tense music) (dramatic music) (Spanky snuffles) (intrigued music) (thunder rumbling) (tense music) (Spanky snuffling) (gunshot blasting) (Laura screams) (Spanky growls) (suspenseful music) Spanky! (suspenseful music) (Spanky growls) (gunshot blasting) (suspenseful music) (gunshots blasting) (Spanky groans) (suspenseful music) (Spanky growls) (suspenseful music continues) (Spanky's body thumping) (melancholic music) Cold, huh? - I still shutter at the strange sensation I had when the gorilla was trying to be tender. - It's strange, very strange. I don't understand it. It's all over now, by the looks of it, so is the storm. Goodnight, darling. - Dan, I'd like to talk about it. - Do you mind if I go into town tomorrow morning and get Carl Reiner? - I don't need a doctor. - Look, Carl's more than a doctor, he's a friend. - Spanky didn't hurt me. It was almost as if his movements were meant to be kind. Gentle. Except when he tore my nightgown. - I couldn't take the chance of him harming you. I had to kill him. - Such a weird incident. Dan? - [Dan] Yes, dear? - Dan, have you ever had the feeling that you've been someplace before or that you'd done something when you actually knew you hadn't? - I guess we all have at one time or the other, why? - The way I felt with the gorilla, almost as if it had happened before, a long time ago. - You have quite an imagination. - If it is imagination. - Let's drop it for now, huh? Get some rest. - Fine wedding night I've given you. - Forget about it, dear. We're going to be married a long time. (dramatic music) - [Laura] How many of us searching our minds, our conscience, our hearts would admit, in another life, perhaps even in another kind of life, we had lived before? I've lived before. I know I have. (intrigued music) I know I've been here before, and I've seen this before. A long, long time ago I can remember this. Why do I see strange things? Why do I see animals, animals, animals? There must be a reason, reason, reason. Why? Why do I remember these things? Now I know. Now I know. I'm a part of all this, a part of this whole scheme of things. After the bunchers came, I ran and ran and ran. I'm frightened. (dramatic trumpet music) I'm thirsty, very thirsty, but I'm frightened. (suspenseful music) (Laura screams) - Laura, Laura, wake up, it's all right, it was just a bad dream. - But it was so real, Dan. - If it was the gorilla, he's dead, dear. He'll never frighten you again. - (panting) It happens all the time, I see them, hundreds of them, animals all over. - But we all dream about animals. I'm always being chased by a lion, a tiger. - I know, but this is different, Dan. It's so real, I see them, I know I do. Sometimes when they've gone and I wake up screaming, I think I'll go out of my mind if I ever have to go to sleep again. - Try not to think about it. I'll get you a light sedative. Here, take these. - I don't want to. - Go ahead. You'll sleep through till morning. I'll get up early and I'll drive to town and get Dr. Reiner. He'll know how to take care of this dream of yours. Come on, let's get some rest. (Dan sighs) - Dan? - Yes? - I'm sorry to be so much trouble. - After that Spanky affair, you're entitled to one bad dream. - Dan? Dan? - Yes? - Do you think we can come back after death? - That's a strange question. - I know. But, do you? I mean, do you think that, perhaps, we've lived before, maybe somewhere else as somebody else? Maybe even something else, that life really never stops for anyone, that it just sort of goes on and on and on, one existence after another? - I never thought about it before. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (intrigued music) (Laura sighs) (tense music) - [Taro] Good morning, Mrs. Fuller. - Good morning. You must be Taro. - [Taro] Yes, ma'am. I make coffee. - Thank you. Were you here when Mr. Fuller left this morning? - Yes, I returned from town 6:30. The bwana, he just leaving then. - Well, do you know if he'll be back soon? - [Taro] It is only an hour into town. (coffee trickling) You look good for all the trouble we have last night. - Well, then, my looks are very deceiving. - You will be going into jungle with bwana and me? - Yes. - You and bwana will be very happy. He has made good choice for wife. (birds singing) (engine rumbling) Excuse me, Mrs. Fuller. (tense music) - [Dan] Hello, Taro. You know Dr. Reiner? - [Taro] Yes, of course. Good morning, doctor. - [Carl] Morning, Taro. - [Taro] May I take your hat, doctor? - [Carl] Thank you. - [Dan] Is Mrs. Fuller awake? - [Taro] In the study, bwana. - [Dan] You know, Carl, I don't agree with you on all of your theories, and besides, I don't think this is too serious, anyway. - Don't worry about it, Dan. We'll see. Hello, Laura. So nice to see you again. - [Laura] Hello, Carl. - You look wonderful. Dan, this wife of yours gets more lovely by the hour. - Oh, you're just trying to get the patient on your side. - Must I? - Well, you're the doctor. - And a very good friend of the family, I hope. - Maybe I'll find something to do outside. Taro and I haven't worked a target in weeks. - [Carl] I'd rather you stay, Dan. - Would you like some coffee, Carl? - Not just now, thank you. - Dan? - No, dear. - Sit down, Laura. Have you ever been hypnotized? - Oh, just once at a party. It was all a big joke, though. - Good, then you know something about it. - Just a little bit. - The mind's a strange instrument. In many areas, the mind has never been explored. And in most cases, where there has been exploration, the findings are far from complete. Now, in hypnotism, we have found things which lead us to believe that our minds have outlived many lifespans. I think we might find, through hypnosis, what your dreams come from and what they mean. Are you willing to participate in such an experiment? - I'll do anything if there's a chance to get rid of that dream. - There's a possibility we'll find the reason. If we do, we'll know the way to handle it. - Yesterday morning, Dan and I were married. Last night, that gorilla business, then the dream again. Dan must think he's married to an idiot of some kind. - Oh, I'm sure Dan's more intelligent, but don't worry. We'll try and find out what's bothering you and get rid of it. Just make yourself comfortable. Now, close your eyes, Laura. - Where do we go from here? - That's what you're going to tell me. Now, keep your eyes closed. Do not open them until I tell you to do so. Do you feel my thumb on your forehead? - Yes. - Do you still feel it? - Yes. - Good. Now you will go into a deep sleep. Sleep, that's it. Sleep, deep asleep. You are now under my complete control. You will not awaken until I tell you to awaken. You will answer all my questions truthfully. You will remain deep asleep and under my control. (intrigued music) - Is she asleep? - No need to whisper, Dan. Your voice won't disturb her. As to her being asleep? Stiffen your arm. Stiffen. That's it. Now don't move it. You want to reach for your coffee but you find you can't. Open your eyes and try to reach for your coffee. (intrigued music continues) Relax your arm. You can move it again. Take your coffee. (intrigued music continues) Now close your eyes. Close your eyes. Go into a deep sleep. Deep, deep sleep. (tense music) What is your name? - Laura. Allison. - [Carl] Is that all? - Laura. Allison. Fuller. I was married yesterday. To Dan Fuller. Angora sweater was such a beautiful thing. Soft like kitten's fur. It felt so good on me. As if it belonged there. I felt so bad when it was gone. - Go into a deeper sleep now. Deep, deep, deep. (tense music) When'd you get the new tiger rug? - India, last trip. Wanted to bring him in alive but the natives had a taboo, he had to be destroyed. Got him with a .370 Weatherby Magnum. - [Carl] Fascinating business. Dan, I'd like to try regression on Laura. - [Dan] Regression? I dunno about all this hypnosis business. - Regression simply means I'll attempt to send her back into time, to a previous existence, if she has had a previous existence. I believe Laura has lived before. (Dan scoffs) - Now, come on, Carl. - Well, her talk of marabou, angora, and fur-like materials, there's definitely a connection between them and her dreams. I believe it is derived from that past existence. Do I have your permission to find out? (tense music) - All right. - Good. We're now going back, back into time. Back before your entry into this life as you now know it. You will speak of that life as you see it. (tense music continues) - It's dark. Very dark. So cold. (intrigued music) I'm so cold. - Go on to your journey, back to the next light of day that you remember. You are no longer of this life. You will see only through the eyes of the life that you have now reached. You will tell me what you are now seeing. Back, back to the endless reaches at the time. Where are you now? - [Laura] I'm in a jungle. I see brush, trees, vines. (primate calling) I see animals. - [Carl] What kind of animals? - [Laura] All kinds. There are many zebras by the water. Elephants moving. A snake is crawling into the underbrush. Leopards moving in the jungle. Lions. So very many lions. The giraffes seem frightened. They're running away. Running from something. - [Carl] Why are they frightened? - [Laura] All the animals are frightened now. - [Carl] Why are the animals frightened? - [Laura] They're frightened of me. - [Carl] Why are they frightened of you? - [Laura] I don't know, but all the animals run when I'm near. - [Carl] Are you hurting the animals? - [Laura] I have hurt them, but I'm not hurting them now. - [Carl] What are you doing now? - [Laura] I'm walking through jungle. Trees and vines don't seem to bother me. I push right through them. - [Carl] You're very strong? - [Laura] Very strong. (tense music) (hog snorts) (hyena cackling) (tense music continues) I'm becoming afraid. - [Carl] Of what? - [Laura] Someone is after me. I'm frightened of the water. - [Carl] Who is after you? - [Laura] I don't know. - [Carl] You are near water? - [Laura] Yes. Water. - [Carl] Why are you frightened of the water? - [Laura] I'm making noises I don't understand. (gorilla grunting) - [Carl] What kind of noises? - [Laura] Growls. - [Carl] Why do you growl? - [Laura] I don't like him. - [Carl] Why don't you like him? - [Laura] He can hurt me. - [Carl] Who can hurt you? - [Laura] He can, his horns are sharp. I don't like him. A water buffalo. He's going now. - [Carl] Are you moving again? - [Laura] Yes. I'm walking through the jungle again. A cool wind brushes my fur. (gorilla growling) - [Carl] What kind of fur is the wind brushing? - [Laura] There. There is the water. I don't want to go to the water. (gorilla grunting) (tense music) I'm so frightened of the water. (gorilla grunting) (tense music) I see my reflection. I'm... I'm a gorilla. (tense music continues) (gorilla grunting) (man screams) (suspenseful music) (gorilla moans) Savages have shot me and it hurts. It hurts. (groaning) - For heaven sakes, Carl, bring her out of it. - Easy. Easy. (Laura groans) Sleep. Deep sleep. (Laura pants) There you are. Nicely, deep sleep. (Laura groans) You are now coming back. Back through time to the present. You will eventually remember all that you have told me but no longer will it trouble you or your dreams. Do you understand? Do you understand? - Yes. - When I count three, two, one, and snap my fingers, you'll awaken as Laura Carson Fuller. You will feel rested, but you'll want a cigarette. Let her rest a moment. - She'll be all right? - Of course. Dan, do you realize we just witnessed a portion of your wife's previous existence, and her death in that existence? - Now, come on, you don't believe she was a gorilla? - All the evidence points to it. Her fixation for fur-like materials comes from that fact. I have a feeling that gorilla, last night, wouldn't have hurt her. - Well, I'm sorry, Carl, I just don't buy all this. - Well, you have a right to your own opinion. However, if I were you, I wouldn't take her into the jungle so soon. - We've made plans, it's our honeymoon, and we're going. - It's up to you, Dan. (pensive music) - You are now going to awaken, Laura. Three, two, one. (fingers snapping) (dramatic music) - How was I? - Marvelous. - You feel all right? - I feel wonderful, except I'd like a cigarette. (airplane whirring) - A few more hours, honey, and we'll be in Africa. - Oh, I can hardly wait to set my feet on solid ground again. (laughing) - Oh, it won't be solid for awhile, yet. - You mean more flying? - No, we'll be heading downriver by cattle boat. - Cattle boat? - Only for a little while. (airplane whirring) This hasn't been so bad, has it? - No, it's been fun. - Look over there. (thrilling music) (both laugh) - Oh! They're kissing right here in front of everybody. - We be docking soon, bwana. I go get luggage ready. - Fine, Taro. (thrilling music) (horn blaring) (thrilling music continues) (cows mooing) - Captain Cameron first, bwana? - Right, then straight to the hunting site. - Well, gee, how about time to catch my breath? - Oh, you can do that on the way. (thrilling music) (cows mooing) (traffic whirring) (horn blaring) (dramatic music) - Well, you are Laura, aren't you? You know, when Dan first described you to me I do not think that anyone could be quite as beautiful, but now that I see you here, I know I was wrong. You are twice as beautiful. (Captain Cameron chuckles) - Oh, thank you very much. He said some some very nice things about you, too. - Ours is a mutual admiration society, eh, Dan? Seriously speaking, though, my dear, there is no white hunter out here who does his job quite as well as Dan over there. - Didn't I tell you? There's nobody like him. - Every word I said is true, Dan. (chuckling) Well, now to business, eh? What's it to be this time, Dan? Capturing or killing? - Oh, a little livestock. We'll go in for a little shooting, though. - Hmm, I suppose you have your papers with you. - Yeah. - Let's see them, huh? Here, let's see, now. Hunting, visa, regulation guarantee, governmental release. Yes, they are all here. Well, (laughs) good hunting, old boy. (laughing) - Thank you. - And take care of the little lady, huh? (laughs) Goodbye, my dear. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, captain. - Bye. (engine rumbling) (primate screeching) - Thank you. - Thank you, Marka. We're being introduced to the brush countries. - Why the drums? - Drums are the jungle telegraph. They can carry a message miles in a matter of seconds. Sometimes they sound like angels in heaven. Sometimes like hell. (drums booming) (suspenseful music) Look out! (suspenseful music) I had to act fast, another second and you would have had it. (dramatic music) - [Laura] What is it, a tarantula? - A tarantula's bite can be just as deadly as a lion's fang or an elephant's foot. - I'm afraid some of the jungle romance is leaving me. - Are you cold in night air? - Thank you, Marka. Oh, it's beautiful. - My village people weave. - This is very sweet of you, thank you, Marka. (cheetah growling) (tense music) Don't make a sound. (suspenseful music) If he comes in, lie very still, he won't hurt you. (cheetah growling) (tense music) (cheetah growls) (suspenseful music) (tense music) (tongue lapping) (tense music continues) Easy. (tense music continues) (tongue lapping) - Why don't you shoot him? - He's worth more to us alive. (tense music continues) (suspenseful music) (cheetah growling) - This is exciting. - Wait till you see how we catch animals on the run. - Come on, let's get dressed. - Right, we'll walk down and see if the boys have that bridge finished so we can move on. (birds calling) They get a scent, they might charge. It's okay now. (animals screeching) (crowd chattering) Taro, how'd you beat us here? - The cheetah walked into a trap, bwana. It was over quickly. Then I take jungle pass. - Good boy, Taro. (crowd chattering) The bridge looks pretty good. Check the trucks and equipment and we'll be moving on. - Yes, bwana. - There they are. Ready for a ride? It'll be a rough one. - Yeah, let's go. (engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) - There, look! He's a fast one, but we'll be just a little faster. (thrilling music) Got him! (suspenseful music) - What's next? - In Africa, who knows? (men murmuring) (thrilling music) (suspenseful music) (vines thwacking) (men chattering) (thrilling music) (dramatic music) (engine revving) (dramatic music continues) - The jungle really gets in your blood, doesn't it? Just one week here and I feel as... I feel as though I've always belonged here. - It can get you. - You ever get tired of it? - Oh, once in a while. Don't forget, this is hard work for me. - I think Cameron was right, you do it all so easily. (Dan chuckles) - I wouldn't say that. (bird screeching) (both laugh) - See, he agrees. - You seem to have a way with the birds, too. - Well, we speak the same language. Isn't that right, my friend? (bird screeching) - (laughing) Oh, you see? (Dan chuckles) - Yes, I see. (Taro clears throat) - [Taro] Bwana, a messenger from Captain Cameron. - What is it? - Captain Cameron sends his respect, sir. He requests your presence at his quarters on a matter of great importance. - Very well. I don't know what it's all about but I won't be too long. Taro, you look after Mrs. Fuller. - [Taro] Yes, bwana. (birds tweeting) (knocking on door) - Come in. Oh, it's you, Dan. I'm glad you could come so quickly, huh? - What's all this about Indian tigers here in Africa? - Oh, an animal ship was wrecked off the coast. Two tigers escaped into the jungle. As far as we know, they are still at large. Hey, have you seen this? (ominous music) (tiger growling) (tense music) (tool sharpener scraping) (tense music) (door clattering) (tense music continues) (leaves thwacking) (tense music continues) (suspenseful music) (tiger growls) (man wails) (tiger growls) (suspenseful music continues) - Incredible. - But two. - When were they last seen? - Two days ago, right here. - That's gorilla country. - I'm aware of that. You know, it might save us some trouble if our tigers latched on to one of those big boys, huh? - The gorilla, with all his strength, is no match for the tiger. The tiger's fast. He's in, ripped his damage, and gone before anyone knows what's happened. - So some of my men have told me. That's why I sent for you. You know about hunting tigers, we don't. Besides, you know that area. Once a tiger has tasted human blood, so they tell me, he's not about to change his diet. (elephant grunting) (birds tweeting) (animal screeching) (drums banging) (horse snorting) - Taro! We'll rest here. - Yes, bwana. (birds tweeting) - Tired? - Exhausted, ooh, the heat. - Here, some water. (elephant grunting) Tonight we'll be in gorilla country. - Is that where we'll camp? - Yes, it's a beautiful spot but it's dangerous. (bird cawing) Taro! Give them 10 minutes, then get them back in line. (birds singing) (suspenseful music) (tiger growling) - It's very good, Marka. Cold out tonight, isn't it? - Well, we'll just have to give you some work and warm you up. (tiger growling) - What is it? - Tigers. (animal screeching) Why, I didn't expect to catch up with them so soon. - They're very close, bwana. (bird screeching) - You stay here, honey. We'll be back in a little bit. - Dan, please be careful, will you? - Don't you worry. Come on, Taro. You boys look after the camp, we'll be back soon. - Do not worry. The bwana is the best hunter of all. He will return safely. (birds singing) (tense music) (tiger growling) (tense music continues) (suspenseful music) (tiger purring) (suspenseful music continues) (gunshots blasting) (tense music) - Too bad, Taro. Cover me. - Yes, bwana. (tense music) (tiger growling) (tense music continues) (birds singing) There is always tomorrow, bwana. - Yeah. (tense music) (tiger growling) - I will teach you how to weave tomorrow. Goodnight, Mrs. Fuller. - Goodnight, Marka. - You can turn in and get some rest, Taro. - Yes, bwana. - No luck, darling? - Nope. (tiger growling) (tiger snarling) (suspenseful music) (birds singing) - Where are you going, Marka? - I go to get more wood. - Do not wander too far into the jungle. The tigers are near. - I'll be careful. (bird cawing) (tiger growling) (birds singing) (tiger growling) (suspenseful music) (Marka screams) (tiger growling) (suspenseful music continues) - What is it? - It's Marka, she's gone into the jungle. - Follow me and cover me 10 paces to the rear. (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (birds singing) (suspenseful music) (tiger growling) (suspenseful music continues) (gunshot blasting) (tense music) (water splashing) (tense music continues) (animal snuffling) (tense music continues) (tiger growling) (suspenseful music) She's still breathing. She's in a bad way. - The tiger is wounded and even more dangerous now, bwana. - I know, let's get her back to camp. Easy. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (tiger growling) (tense music) (birds singing) (dramatic music) (animal screeching) (tense music) (tiger growling) (birds singing) - It hold tiger. (tiger growling) (rifle cocking) - How is she? - Marka's dead. - Are you going after the tiger? - Bwana! Bwana! Bwana, we have one of them in the trap. - Well, come on! (bird cawing) (tiger growling) (tiger snarling) This isn't the one I shot. Let's leave her in the pit tonight and maybe her mate will come looking for her. (tiger growling) Let's take our position. (tiger growling) (dramatic music) (tiger growling) - Now it grows late, bwana. - That cat'll come, I'm sure of it. (suspenseful music) (tiger growling) (rock pounding) (tense music) (panther growling) (gunshot blasting) (tense music) - [Taro] Thank you, bwana. - We'll bag that tiger yet. You go on back to camp and get some rest. - [Taro] But you, bwana? - I'm going to stay out here for a little while. What I have in mind is a one man's job. - [Taro] Yes, bwana. - Pick up your rifle. - Yes, bwana. (tense music) (hyena cackling) (tense music continues) (tiger growling) (tense music) (dramatic music) (birds tweeting) (Dan yawns) (primates calling) (dramatic music) (primates calling) (dramatic music continues) (tense music) (Dan yawns) (tiger growling) (suspenseful music) (gunshots blasting) (tiger growling) (tense music) (suspenseful music) (tiger growling) (tense music) (tiger growling) (tense music continues) (suspenseful music) (tiger growling) (Laura screams) (suspenseful music continues) (tiger growling) (Laura wails) (suspenseful music continues) (Laura screams) - Laura! (tiger growls) (suspenseful music) (Laura screams) (tiger growling) (Laura screams) (suspenseful music) (tiger growls) (suspenseful music continues) (Laura screams) (tiger growls) (ominous music) (tiger purring) (tense music) (birds singing) Laura! (birds cawing) (tense music) (tiger purring) (tense music continues) (tiger growling) (tense music) (gunshot blasting) (tense music) (tiger growling) (tense music) (suspenseful music) (tiger growling) (gunshot blasting) (tiger growling) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) It's a mighty nasty crack on her head. - It was bad fall, bwana. I can go for doctor. - [Dan] Without a car it'd take a couple of days. - Without pack, I can take short path through river and mountain. Doctor and I could return by Jeep. - Yes, you might be able to make it. Go ahead, Taro, try it. - She sleeps long now, bwana. It is best you take time to treat your own wounds.

Basically, we're all animals, so a reversion just can't be ignored. Perhaps the injury, when she fell at the time of the tiger attack, had something to do with it. - I can't believe she's gone. - Dan, the the night we hypnotized her, she displayed some very unusual animal tendencies, and that she had been a gorilla in a past life seems rather positive. I believe she's gone, Dan. Gone back where she came from. (ominous, thrilling music)
