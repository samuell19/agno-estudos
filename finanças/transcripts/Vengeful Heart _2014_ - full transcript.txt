I need to speak to Dr. Minh, head of the department. Hello? Dr. Minh? it's me, Sau Dung. . . we've just discovered a body in a traffic accident. the strange thing is, the victim was crushed to death, but the heart is completely intact. Mr Son... your wife's heart transplant was a success She survived the most critical stage Really? she's currently in recovery on level 4. You can see her now. thank you so much after this operation Her health won't be the same as before You'd better take good care of her, you hear me? Yes, dad! Look at you Probably haven't eaten anything yet, right? No, dad! then what are you standing there for? come with me to the canteen for breakfast . Yes, sir. she needs to rest Yes, sir. 45 days later pack this for the customer. Yes, Ms. Linh I knew you'd be here! I just wanted to help out, since we're so busy today. besides, it's so boring at home. . but did the doctor say it's okay for you to start working? don't worry, honey. can't you see? I haven't felt tired in over a month. you're just over-reacting. alright. I'm going home . I'm leaving. - Remember to turn off the lights and lock up - Yes Ms. Linh Ms. Linh, your coat - Your bag - Thank you! . *Vengeful Heart* Ripped by teSir what's wrong, darling? did you dream about that house again? I'm fine. don't worry. it's just a dream. I just had a chat with Dr. Minh. with all these recurring nightmares... It might be that you're thinking too much. Or perhaps... stressed out from work. I think you should take some time off to relax. you just checked out of the hospital And already you're back at the bakery! I'm not doing anything unusual, dad. The bakery is the place where I feel the happiest. would you rather... I lock myself up in this house and die from depression? no, no! my point is that since you're having the same nightmares over and over again... Be careful. that could be a sign of a mental... Wait... I didn't mean "mental". I meant "psychological". Yes, a psychological problem, not mental! Tomorrow I'll take you to the hospital to have a check up. I'm not going back there. Okay, if you don't want to go there... then tomorrow, I'll have the doctor come here, okay? - Dad! - What? . We have a meeting to go to. It's time? - Yes, dad! - Oh, I forgot. . I'm off to work now. Good bye, honey. Son!!! Dad! I'm sorry! I... did Ms. Tu call you? no, dad. What's wrong? Linh's gone missing! She's not answering her phone. . - Has Ms. Linh come by here this morning? - No, not yet. . Miss Miss where am I? what am I doing here? . who are you? why are my clothes dirty? Oh my God! my feet! you don't know how you got here? where do you live? Near the Cathedral don't tell me you walked all the way here. have some water. And clean your feet. can you remember anything at all? I just remember... I was... I was in my living room And now... Now I'm here. So... you were sleep walking? It's never happened before. what's your name? - Linh. - I'm Tam. . whose grave is this? My wife. She died so young. how did it happen? car accident. can you help me get a taxi? It's hard getting a taxi to come out here at this time. how about you wait a bit... I'll take you back to my place Then you can call your family to come pick you up My house is close by. are you ok? I think... I've seen this house before. - You're back, Tam? - Yes, mother. who is she? Hello, madam I found her sleeping next to Phuong's grave. what? I think... It was just a coincidence. If it happens once then it's a coincidence. but if she dreamt about it several times... how do you explain that? or perhaps... she used to pass by this house... but never noticed... And the image somehow lingered in her mind And so she dreamt about it. that's your explanation? If... I just passed by... Then how could I possibly know... What's inside this house? the feeling is very real... I've seen myself... step into this room... I remember this! This statue! The cabinet over there... has two family portraits. there's more. And out here there's... Boo! - What the hell are you doing? - Oh. Sorry. this is Hu. he manages our family's flower farm. He likes to pull pranks like that. Please don't be mad. what's wrong with you, Hu? why didn't you use the main door? I... I just wanted to spook her a bit. I didn't think she'd go into shock. my wife just had a heart transplant. she can't take these kind of jokes. I'm sorry, I didn't know. Are you ok? I'm fine. don't worry. I don't blame you. you just had a heart transplant? Yes. about a month ago. - what day? - day? date of your transplant. August 13th. Da Lat General Hospital? what's wrong? Phuong! you're the one who's carrying my wife's heart. now I understand, why these past few days I've been dreaming about this house It seems... Phuong wanted me to come see all of you thank you for visiting me on Phuong's behalf. This past month... I've thought about her every moment... Phuong... Phuong... Can I give you a hand? - you can... wash the veggies for me. - Sure. thank you Hey, Hu. your name is quite unusual. Oh. Well, to be honest... My name actually has a good story to it When my mother was pregnant with me 9 months and 10 days. I still didn't come out She was sad She went to the marketplace to hang out Her friend thought that she had already given birth So he screamed and scared the living daylights out of her I came out on the spot! - So you live here as well? - that's right. Phuong's father brought me here from the village since I was just fifteen you must have been very close with Phuong? Yes, well... The three of us have been close since we were young. we ate together, slept together. Even bathed together No, I meant... We bathed in the streams. So basically... When we were kids... we bathed nude A litter older... We went semi-nude Then even older... We were nude again. But no longer bathing together. why are you looking at me like that? You smile... Just like Phuong. - Have some more of this. - Thank you Auntie. When she was still alive Phuong loved to eat these pork ribs. Oh, Heaven! You're just like Phuong! I remember... One time Auntie Le passed some food to Phuong. Phuong just ate. Without returning the favor. Please - Auntie, have some - Thank you Exactly the same! There was a time I had to remind Phuong. She felt so embarassed She passed some food back to Auntie! And Auntie ate! you two were a perfect couple. Thank you They were best friends since little. To be honest. I didn't think they would get married. How come? Well... After high school, Tam went to Saigon to find work. He only contacted us a few times over the years. Auntie Le. A man's career must come first. Anyway, in the end... he still came back to marry Phuong. A happy ending. Too bad it only lasted a year. Eat up everyone. - Oh. You're not eating anymore? - No. I'm full. .. Then take a bath and get some rest Mama and Hu will clean up. Mother. I'm sorry. I thought... Please excuse us We have to get going soon. Oh. why? Tomorrow is Phuong's 49 Day ritual That pig is for tomorrow's ceremony Stay and eat pork! That's right. You two stay It's not really convenient... Maybe some other time. - We'll stay over! - Honey! Thank you Eat up folks! Yes, dad. I understand sir! We'll be home tomorrow. Don't worry, dad. Yes, dad. Goodbye, dad. what's wrong? Look at you You don't feel weird wearing Phuong's clothes? What else would I wear? But this belongs to a dead person. Phuong, Since you've been gone I miss you so much, Phuong I... I miss you like crazy. But... please Don't come back and see me. No, it's okay. We can meet. But during the daytime okay? No, wait. At night is fine, too. But... Remember to switch on the lights, okay? At least give me a warning before you show up. Thanks so much, Phuong. What? You're back! Honey, honey. Linh! Linh! Can you hear me? Linh! Linh! Where am I? Calm down you don't remember anything? But... Why are you out so late? I was coming back from the flower farm I came here and saw you walking in Phuong's clothes I thought... - This place looks familiar - Phuong and I used to come here all the time. .. The place of the accident... It's close by, isn't it? - How did you know? - I just had this feeling... Maybe Phuong's heart wanted you to come here. I was so worried about you, honey. where've you been? I'm sorry. I was sleepwalking again. I don't remember anything. .. If it wasn't for Tam I'd probably be lost in the woods - Thank you, Tam - No problem Oh, Tam Here's you jacket Hold onto it. It's cold out here. Let's go, honey. Uncle Sau It's been a long time - How've you been? - Good, good. - Time for the ceremony yet? - No, sir. Not yet. Why don't you go inside first, I'll be in later. Tell me, Sau... Any new developments into my daughter's case? Nothing yet. We've increased manpower Hopefully, we'll find the perpetrator soon. What about Phuong's car? Still hasn't shown up. Maybe the perpetrator hasn't sold the car yet. You still think this was a robbery? All evidence is pointing in that direction Why are we leaving? Aren't you forgetting that we have to stay for Phuong's 49 Day ceremony? We've been here since yesterday! We've paid enough respects! Let's go! How can we leave them now? We already lit incense for Phuong last night. What more do we need to do? Why are you so unreasonable? You calling me unreasonable? I'm your husband! If I say we're leaving then we're leaving! How dare you yell at me! Yeah, well... Deal with it! Fine, we'll go. You don't have to be so mean. You're not going to tell dad, are you? Don't be like that, honey. We'll come back to visit them. Honey! Look out! Where are you going? Why are you leaving? Auntie. I'm sorry. But... We really have to go. - How can you leave me like that? - Calm down, Auntie. You don't love me anymore Phuong? Phuong. Don't leave me Lady, you're making a mistake! This is my wife, not your daughter - Honey! - Son!!! What's wrong with you people? You're not making it any better for her. Phuong! Don't go! I beg you! Don't go! Lady, take a good look! This is Linh, my wife! Your daughter Phuong is dead! She's not coming back! I can't believe you! Mother! Mother! I'm... I'm sorry. You're right. My daughter is dead. - Phuong... - Mother... - Auntie. - Mother. Mother. That's some heavy liquor. More importantly... Was it good? I'm feeling a little tipsy already. You drink like a chicken. Just one sip and you're falling apart. Hey. A man... Must live like he has a pair. - A "pair?" - A pair. - A pair of what? - A pair of balls. - Understand? Manly. - Of course, of course... a man... must have balls. But how come... You can speak with our accent, yet you don't? - Then why don't you talk like me and I'll talk like you. - Oh, right. Well, I haven't had anything to eat since morning Usually, I can drink pretty well Let me ask you something... You... You... are from the West Side, how come you suck at drinking? Who says I'm from the West Side? I'm from the North! I meant you're from the North West, how come you suck at drinking? I'm not from the North West I'm just from the North I meant how come you're from the North, not from the West Side, and you suck at drinking? I have no idea what you're saying. Whatever, just drink. You're drunk. You don't get it. Drink up. This has always been Phuong's pride and joy Since she passed away... It's become pretty bleak around the flower farm. What happened that night? Can you tell me? That night... I had to visit my grandparents. My grandfather was sick. In the middle of the night I received a call from the police They needed me to identify Phuong's body Where was Phuong going that night? I don't know But the police had a theory. That night... She was going to meet her lover. Well... Do you believe it? What would you think? When your wife... Drives out in the middle of the night, without telling anyone. Anyway. I just want it all to end. I just want to hold onto the beautiful memories of her. Linh! Are you ok? It's almost time for the ceremony. We should get back. It seems like... Phuong is mad about something Do you think... The pig we're offering is too small? Goodbye. Are you ok? I can't breath - Take her inside. - Go inside. Go inside. Sit down. Get her some water. - It's ok. - Are you sure you're alright? It's strange. As soon as I stepped into the house I felt normal again. How do you feel now? - I feel fine now. - That's strange. What is it, Hu? Maybe... Phuong doesn't want Linh to leave this place - It's so beautiful, Hu! - And I'm so tired, Linh! - Take a break. I'll take over. - I'm only kidding. See that? I'm not tired at all! Hey, Hu. Look over there. - Where? I don't see anything. - I could've sworn I saw a woman standing on the lake! - Hey!! What are you doing? - That's it! Get me out of here! Party's over! Who can stand on the lake??? Don't mess with me 'cause you know I'm a chicken! That ain't cool! I'm not joking. I'm really serious. Let's go over there and check it out. A boar's tooth... I definitely saw someone here! Why don't I see anyone now? I might've been mistaken. Nevermind. Let's go back. Go back? I... I think The scenery here is pretty nice Let's stay a bit and enjoy the view If you're tired then just admit it. Of course I'm tired! I'm a human, not an animal! Hey, hey! Let me drop the anchor I feel like you really cared for Phuong Yeah... Well... Friends care about each other, that's normal. You loved Phuong didn't you? Don't say things like that I... I saw Phuong as a little sister I... Being secretly in love with someone is really tough. Honestly I... loved Phuong way back... Since we were still in high school. But at that time she had Tam. I didn't dare interfere. But then, when Tam... when he left to Saigon... and he didn't contact Phuong for years... I had this terrible idea... I thought... It was my chance with her. But... Phuong... didn't love me She could only... She could only think about that jerk. The day Phuong got married. I was really happy. I ran out here and hugged this boat, and cried so much. But don't get me wrong. I cried Because I was happy for Phuong, that's all. Hu, I believe Phuong understood your feelings for her. - Hey!! You still tired? - No, I'm good. Let's head back, okay? This is the first time that I cried in front of a girl. I usually only cry in front of boys! You're so cute! - Hey. Hey, look out - It's stuck That's Phuong's car! There are only 3 motives for a murder! For money. Revenge. And love. If it was for money Then why after killing Phuong the killer didn't sell this car? Instead he dumped it into the lake. If it was revenge then after killing Phuong - I mean really, the car is innocent! Why'd he have to dump it into the lake? If it was for love Then killing Phuong was enough. He might even get rid of Tam too! Why'd he have to dump the car into the lake? In short, why the hell did he dump the car into the lake? Are you ok? You've been in here for over an hour. - Really? - You can sleepwalk in the bathroom? - No, no. - Nevermind, I'm just glad you're okay. At first I could not stand the idea... that they would take the heart from my daughter body. But when the doctor said the other girl has waited over a year for a suitable heart And if she waited any longer She would surely die. If you hadn't changed your mind then I wouldn't be here with you now. I owe you my life. Linh... Can you call me Mother? Yes... Yes, mother. Tam What are you doing in here? - You were sleepwalking again. - What's inside this cabinet? Phuong's daily items Our anniversary gifts Maybe... Phuong wanted me to visit her room How do you feel? Does this room seem familiar to you? Honestly I don't have any clear feelings about this place. What about me? What's your feeling about me? - I... I don't know. Just that I feel very close to you. - Do you remember anything about me? Yes... But it's very unclear. I often see... You... and me... No. You and Phuong, actually. Walking side by side holding hands And then... What the hell are you doing? - They were about to kiss. - I know!!! Then what's the point of asking? Let me remind you that this is my wife, not yours! Don't you dare say another word! You stayed because of him. I noticed everything. The way he looks at you. - Where did you get that idea? - Do I need to explain in detail? Last night, you wandered off somewhere with him. Now you crawled up to his bedroom. - Am I missing anything? - Can't you see I haven't been myself lately? It's like I can't control myself. What if She had some unfinished business and can't reincarnate? Phuong's death was an accident Everything else is just your imagination Everyone in this house has gone crazy! If you still think of me as your husband - Then you'll leave with me right now! - No. I can't. You trying to be difficult? - If you want to go... Then go by yourself - You know that father will kill me if I go home without you - Why do you always care about what father thinks? - Does your dad ever let me live the way I want? Both you and your dad always want to control me! How can you say such things? I've always respected you Respect me? I can see you respecting this God-forsaken house maybe! Do you know how embarassing it is for a man to live under the same roof with his in-laws? If you think that marrying me is such an embarrassment then we should reconsider this marriage. Maybe we should. - I'm listening, dad. - What the hell are you doing? Why aren't you home yet? Where have you taken my daughter? Do you hear me? Son of a bitch. Please, help me out, will you? I'll pay you anything you want. Are you crazy? It this storm? Asking me to come fix your car? Call me back in the morning. But... Hello? Hello, hello? Hey, did I say "boo"? Why are you so spooked? - You in a rush? I'll get you a taxi. - But I can't leave without my wife Hu, Hu! - Can I sleep with you tonight? - You and your wife already took over my room up there - Now you want to take my couch too? - Go ahead, take the couch. - I'd rather sleep on the ground. - You must be used to your wife making you sleep on the ground, right? I'm almost there, dad. I'm almost there! Yes yes yes... I know, I know. Help me! Help me! Hu, Hu! Something strange is going on. I'm begging you. Please forgive me. I didn't want to leave you behind like that. But my wife was dying in the hospital. I had no other choice! I'm so sorry. I didn't meant to kill you - Son!! What did you just say? - I... I didn't say anything - We all heard. You said something about an accident - What's all the commotion? What are you hiding from us? The night Phuong died... Where were you? - Tam! What are you saying? - Answer me! The night Phuong died, where were you? You're the one who killed my wife! You killed my wife...! - Tam! - Linh... Tam is right. - It was me. - You son of a bitch!!! I'll kill you! Die bastard! You son of a bitch! - Why did you kill Phuong? - You want to beat me, call the cops... do whatever you want! Calm down! Let the police deal with him! I'm going to call Uncle Sau. Hello. Uncle Sau? It's Hu! We caught the guy who dumped the car into the lake! - Who is this? - The person you ran over. I ran over Phuong. - Yes. This is Phuong. - This is also Phuong. No, no! After I hit her I got out and checked. She didn't look like this. She was still moving. You used the car and crushed her then ran away, is that correct? No, never! I even called 113! You told me that you'd come right away. I'm positive that when I left She was still alive! I'm sorry. For all the things... That my husband has done... To you and your family. Drink up ! The night before Phuong died She and I were also drinking here. She sat right there, just like you. It's strange. You're sitting in the same position... With the same sad face, too. What was she sad about? Phuong just told me She and Tam Had some problems. But she didn't go into detail. - She just cried. - Even in marriage... It's hard to understand each other completely. Are you ok? Your face is so red. Is your heart having problems? I'm ok. My blood type is 0. So it's easy to get red. - What blood type did you say you were again? - Type 0. - Are you sure? - It's my blood type, of course I'm sure. But Phuong is... Type AB... how could she have given you the heart? - Are you sure Phuong was AB? - Hell yeah! I took Phuong to get blood tests all the time. I knew her medical records like the back of my hand - Hu - What? - I don't see anything. - Do you smell that? Hu, I think it's coming from Tam's room. I don't smell anything. - It's locked. - We have to find a way to break in Or else the house will burn down! Ok, move aside. Are these talismans? I think so, But why does Tam have all these talismans in the cabinet? More importantly... Who is that on the altar? I wonder why he has an altar in this cabinet. This girl looks familiar. - You scared me. - I'm scared, too. I remember now. The girl from Saigon. About a week before Phuong died. I met this girl. - Who are you? Why did you enter without knocking? - The door was open. - Who are you looking for? - I'm here to see Tam. What for? - I'm his client in Saigon. - Saigon folks are real courteous, aren't they? Tam! There's someone from Saigon looking for you. - But at that time She looked completely healthy. - Should we call Tam for an explanation? No. I'm thinking... Maybe this girl... Might have something to do with Phuong's death. But more important... Is this bloodtype issue. You should look at this. I think... It's an important piece of evidence in this case. To be honest, during the initial autopsy We discovered several suspicious details. But at that time, our priority was the heart replacement for Ms. Linh. So we had to conduct our investigation in secret. - Does it mean... - The heart that I'm carrying is not Phuong's. - Well, then Whose corpse was it? - Over the past months... We've been looking into several missing person cases. There are 5 girls that match the description we're looking for. Take a look. Check this out. Do any of the girls look like her? - Where did you get this picture? - In Tam's cabinet. - Is that Tam's car? - Yes. Yes, it's his car! - Hu! Stop! Stop! - Oh, Heaven! You scared the hell out of me! What's wrong? - Where does this road lead to? - To the flower farm - Is there anything else in there? - Oh... just some abandoned villas. Let's go and check them out. You should know Those abandoned mansions Are haunted. Rumour has it... Drug addicts... Go in there and get high... without even shooting up! Come on, Hu! I really have a strong feeling about this! I think... this is what I've been searching for! Please help me. That's it. That's the house that's been appearing in my head. How about we just leave? We can come back tomorrow. I have this strange feeling For the first time in my life I'm thirsty and I need to take a leak at the same time. - Hey... there's still some oil. - Light it up. It's dark in here. - A ghost! - Hu! Calm down. It's just a mannequin. If everything is like my dream... Then definitely There's a basement over there. Phuong! You're alive... - Hu! Is that really you? - Don't cry. Who did this to you? I'm going to call Uncle Sau. Hi. My name is Linh. Uncle Sau? I found Phuong! She's still alive! - Where are you? - At the abandoned house on Ma Ta Hill. Hang tight, I'll be there in 30 minutes. Right now, I have something urgent to deal with. Yes, sir. Tam brought me here. He's kept me locked up for over a month. - Everyday he brings me food and pain killers. - Everyone thinks you're dead. Until we discovered the bloodtypes didn't match. - Didn't match? With who? - With a body that had been run over. The face was crushed To the point where it couldn't be identified. - It had to be Hong. - Kim Hong? You know her, too? - Who was she? - Tam's mistress. Mistress? Since when? Tam tried to keep it from me after we got married. - What are you doing here? - I came to see you. I couldn't call you. Are you trying to avoid me? Tam told me Hong was just a client from Saigon looking to discuss business. But my female intuition told be otherwise. That night Tam said he had to take care for his grandfather. In fact... it was all part of his intricate plan. But then, something unexpected happened. If you want to know your husband's true colors, then go to the abandoned house on Ma Ta Hill It turns out... This is where they've been secretly meeting. I've been here for a week now. I want to go to a hotel. How many times do I have to tell you? What if people see us? What did you promise me? You said that after a few months of marriage you'll get all the money and dump her. - Calm down, Hong! - Calm my ass!!! While you're lovey dovey with your wife up here I have to go into hiding because of our debts! No, no. It's YOUR debt to be exact! It just happens to be under my name. - Now the mob is after me. And you want to kick me to the curb? - Not exactly. You're in love with that chick, aren't you? You're so naive! If that little wife of yours knew you had nothing in Saigon, would she still love you? Don't... Don't do anything stupid, Hong It's too late. I'm going to let your wife know What kind of a con man you really are! A loser who leeches off of women! I'll let the whole world know What kind of an asshole you really are! Phuong... Phuong... Stop! Let me explain! Phuong... Help me! Help me! Phuong... Hello? Is this the police? There's been an accident on Hai Van road, please come quick! Phuong... Phuong... Are you ok, Phuong? I told you not to run. You're a murderer. I have to report you... I won't forgive you. Tam brought me here Then switched my clothes with Hong's Then he took Hong's body somewhere else. To avoid being seen Tam used a shortcut in the flower farm to check up on me. What do you plan to do now? Kill me? I love you... How can I kill you? But right now, I can't allow you to leave. I'm sorry. But when the police discovered the body Why couldn't they tell it wasn't Phuong? Because... Tam set it up to look like an accident. Don't. Please don't. Hello? I'm here, Uncle Sau. - Are you ok? - We're still waiting for you. What's taking you so long? I'm at the flower farm. I followed Tam home. For some reason, he returned to the flower farm. - But I got here, I didn't see him anywhere. - Oh, shit! Phuong told me At the flower farm. There's a shortcut Leading to this house. - Hu! - Hu! Are you ok, Hu? Hu! - I gave you so many chances. - Tam! Why couldn't you just let it go? You want me to die, is that it? Linh, run!!! Go to the police, don't mind me! Hu! I'm going to crush your heart. Let's see if you can come back again! Police! Drop the knife! Drop the knife! Hands up! Phuong... - Mom! - My darling. I think it's time we move to the next phase of our relationship - Divorce? I knew it! - No, silly. I meant... I want to have a baby. You plannig on moving to the next phase out here? I'm sorry, dad. It's so much trouble for you to come out here. Trouble my ass. We're family, that's what we do! - You probably haven't eaten anything since last night, right? - No, dad. - Can you still walk? - No... Let's go have breakfast. Why are you all dressed up today, Hu? It's like Valentine's Day. Ah, all-lover's day. Oh Heaven, don't do that! So you've seen it, now cover it up! No. Just leave it. It looks nice anyway. - What are you doing? - Kiss? Kiss? You and I... haven't even held hands yet. How can we kiss? At least confess your love to me first. - Confess my love? - Yes. - Oh, I forgot. Phuong! I've wanted to say this for a very long time. Let's make babies. - This is what you call a confession of love??? - No? Oh, nevermind. Forget the confession, let's just go rowing today! What are you laughting at? Just enjoy the view, ok?
