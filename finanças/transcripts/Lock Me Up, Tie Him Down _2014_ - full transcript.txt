Of course. I planned Project Q for an entire year He has to believe it's a win-win plan A year ago We were university classmates Everyone called him Mr Yang But that wasn't his surname We lived in the same dorm but didn't have much contact We donated sperm together at a charity event for children once You've been in there for 30 mins Don't waste our resources if you can't do it That's how he got the nickname Yang Wei (impotent) That's why we called him Mr Yang Wei I would meet him occasionally after that Mostly I talked and he listened Later he started to talk He told me he was unhappy at work as... ...people there knew about his past He found a job in Hong Kong to get away from that But people still found out The minute he said that, the plan for Project Q came to me I suggested we play a game of kidnap He would kidnap me His objective would be to make Tiffany his wife for a week His colleagues could visit and he could prove he's a complete man He asked me... What? What if she calls the police? I said... She wouldn't do that You might kill me if she did Then what? What? She won't call the police. We're accomplices Why would you help me? I gave a big sigh I've met another woman A mistress I can't handle two women. I've lost weight I love this woman. I want to go away with her He asked why I would want another woman I said, eating lobster and abalone every day gets boring I've been eating the same lobster for eight years Men must have fresh food Who wouldn't agree to this win-win plan? Cheers If the insurance claim from the factory robbery and your wife's death... ...can't save your business... ...these two bullets will be for you and me The plan won't fail For you and for our baby... I'll kill them both and say I saw them killing each other Perfect! I'm not wearing that Why don't you ever wear pink? It suits you You looked in my closet?
