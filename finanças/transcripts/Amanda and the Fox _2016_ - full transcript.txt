You're such a good boy, Max. Yes, you are. You like that name? Do you? Me too. Yeah, no. No, no. Looks like you have a wig, when you have that much soap on your head. Flowers. Max, you look so squeaky clean for when my dad first sees you. I'm home. Amanda? The good news is, it's not cold enough to make any snow. It's gonna be mainly rain, even on Saturday. Amanda? A mix across parts of Ontario and Quebec. Dad? You'll never guess what happened. Well, did it involve a tornado? Dad, you alive over there? What? What happened in here? Yeah, that's what I would like to know. - What the? - Is that a dog? Yeah, Dad, it's a dog. A dog in my house with my daughter. You know, the granddaughter in the house you're supposed to be watching? Don't worry, it's just Max. He likes you. He looked so sad when I found him, I had to help. What were you thinking? That maybe we could keep him? You're joking, right? I just had a little nap. I promise I'll take good care of him, please, Dad? He's, he's a stray, and he's got nowhere else to go, please? A stray? You mean that kinda stray? Call me if I can lend a hand, son. Thanks, Dad. Bye, Grandpa. I can't thank you enough. We were so worried about him. That's not a problem, Amanda deserves all the credit. She's the one that found him. Thank you for finding our dog. You can come play with us sometime if you want? C'mon, Bernie, let's go play I know you're upset, but I really need to know that whenever I'm out meeting with a client, you're gonna be responsible, and I'm not gonna come home to a trashed house. Can I count on ya? Yes. You sure? Because you and I both know that Grandpa's just gonna fall asleep in that chair. I can always get Mrs. Crabtree to come over and watch you instead. No, I like Grandpa. It won't happen again. Okay. Well, when you're ready, clean up the mess you made. I'm gonna go fix dinner. Mom would have wanted a dog. I know she would have. I know. But Mom would have also been here to help take care of it. It's just me and you now, and dogs are a big responsibility. You're just not ready yet, but maybe in a couple of years when you're older. Promise? We'll see, kiddo. C'mon, little dearies. Everybody come and get your breakfast now. Good girls. C'mon, now. Judge Weartherbee will toss this suit out in a heartbeat. Dad? No, that's crazy. No. Dad? What, John, John, hold on second, yeah. Yeah, I know, hold on a second. I'm on the on the phone. Can I walk with Maggie over to see Aunt Kathy? Fine. Okay, have a good time, Amanda. Love you, too. Look, I just don't think that Mclean's gonna agree to that, John. Yeah. Alright, already, let's go. When I get older, I'm gonna have like a gazillion dogs. Why? Don't you like dogs? I like Roscoe, but he's a pain. My parents make me walk him everyday. And he gets hair everywhere. And he stinks really bad. He does not. Don't listen to her, Roscoe. Yes, he does. He's a walking fart machine. Trust me. And when he does his business, it's totally gross. Well, I wouldn't care, I'd just be happy to have a dog. Even if it only had like three legs or something, I'd still take care of it. Why won't your dad let you have one? Is it because of your mom? What do you mean? I don't know, I thought maybe because your mom was a dog trainer, that dogs made him feel bad or something. I didn't think about that. I'm sorry, we don't have to talk about your mom if you don't want to. No, it's okay. I didn't like it at first. Especially when I came back to school after she died. Everyone was really nice and everything, but I really did not wanna talk about it, and that's all they wanted to do. Now it's just like it helps me remember her, you know? I get this warm feeling inside of me, like she's looking down on me from Heaven. Well, you can come over and walk Roscoe anytime you want. - Really? - Yeah. Thanks. - No. - No, squirrel. Maggie. Look out for the... Garbage cans. Hey, You would never drag my best friend halfway down the street. Would you? Just a scratch. Nothing's broken. You know, girlie, that's exactly the kinda thing your mom would have done. She used to bring home all kinds of strays. Really? Heck, yeah, cats, dogs, turtles, you name it. If it needed a home, she would try and find it one. She even used her dog sitting money to have us registered as an official wildlife sanctuary with the state. She did? Yeah, even when we were kids. No, scratch that, especially when we were kids. She always used this to guide her decisions, instead of this. She had the biggest, kindest heart I've ever known. And she loved dogs the most, right? Well there was one thing she loved more. Really? What? Us, silly. Her family. Duh. Dad's not really a heart guy, is he? No. No, he is not. But I do know that he loves you just as much. And if you really want a pet, you just have to convince him with a really strong argument. Show him that you can take some responsibility, and he'll come around. You'll see. Now my beautiful little niece, you're just about good to go. You just need one more thing before you'll feel 100% better. You know what that is? Puppy kisses. How 'bout that? Heck yeah. C'mon. Here, hey. I love you. Are you sure this time, brother? Yes, Dimitri, I see little kitty, he run that way. No, no. No, no. How many times I tell you, Boris? It's not kitty, it's kit. It's English word kit meaning small fox. This is what I say. English kit, he run that way. It rhyme. This is what I say, English kit, he run that way. This is what I say, English kit, he run that way. - This is... - Boris? Get out. This is what I say, English kit, he go this way. Excuse me? You two? Hello, kind lady, how are you doing today? Are you from animal control? You are from animal control, aren't you? Yes, yes, yes, we are from animal controlling. I thought so. I thought I could feel some strange creature watching over me. I think it might be after my poor bunnies. You will protect my bunnies, won't you? Is this bunnies your backside? No, no, no, my rabbits. They're very special to me. I am understanding, now this is making much more sense now. Shh. Do you like your freedom, should I just let you go? Let you run free? Would you like that? That's my Mr. Lincoln. You can't take him. It's misunderstanding. Boris, give the nice lady back her Mr. Lincoln, and we continue our searching. No. Boris, give it back. C'mon, little bunny. C'mon, poor baby, c'mon, Mr. Lincoln. Good boy, that's my bunny, bunny. Hey? You girls be careful, there's a strange creature on the loose in the neighborhood. Yes, Mrs. Crabtree. And Margaret Cavanaugh, you see that that dog of yours doesn't do his business on my yard again. Yes, Mrs. Crabtree. Sorry, Mrs. Crabtree. I'm back. Hey, good timing. So, I was thinking about what we were talking about yesterday. You know, the pet situation? Really? I do listen to ya, you know? Anyway, I think I came up with a good compromise. Go check your room. He's waiting for ya. Thank you, thank you. Here, boy. Where are ya boy? Come on out. I guess it's the thought that counts, right Max? You don't really seem like a Max. More like a, I don't know. Sorry, don't take it personally. I bet you're a really nice little guy and all, it's just, I really had my heart set on, well, not a turtle, you know? Max? C'mon, Max. I said, don't take it personally. No need to run. My gosh. There's a fox in my yard. There's a fox in my yard. What does a fox eat? What does a fox eat? Where have I heard that before? What does a? Maggie, get over to my house right now. You'll never guess. Amanda, what'd ya think? About what? The turtle, silly? Yeah, just getting him some more lettuce. I named him Max. I'm glad you like him. That's the ticket. Are you sick, boy? You don't look sick. I bet you're the one those dog catcher's are looking for, aren't you? But why? You wouldn't hurt anybody. Would you, Maxie? Do you mind sharing a name, boy? It fits you better, anyway. Here, go on, take it. I probably shouldn't even be talking to you. I mean, it's not like I can keep you. You're a fox after all and besides, if dad found you, I'd get into so much trouble. I can't let those dog catchers get you. Aunt Kathy says that when animal control gets wild animals, they, well, trust me, it would not be fun. Let's just say, I better keep you around for a few days until the coast is clear. How does that sound, Maxie? Sound good? Who are you talking to? Hi, Dad, I, I was just talking to Max. To Max? My turtle, remember? Yeah, I remember, he's right here in the kitchen. Yes, I know, I, I just like to keep the conversation going, that's all. Yeah, well, come in and get cleaned up. I'm making a special dinner for us. Okay, I'll be right there. Okay. I won't let anything happen to you, Max, I promise. I could have sworn that I bought two chicken breasts. It must be old age. Gettin' forgetful, Dad? Yeah, you're gonna have to put me in the old folks home soon? Good one. So... tell me about Max. What about him? He's fine. Eating a lot of lettuce. Doing everyday, normal turtle stuff, you know? That's, that's good, yeah. Everything okay, Dad? What? yeah, sorry. I have something to tell ya, and I put it off for too long, and it's, and it's nothing bad. In fact, it's actually really good news. I'm just not sure how to tell ya. Amanda, I... I forgot, I asked Maggie if she can come over and play. Can she stay for dinner? Sure. Thanks for letting me stay, Your Honor. My mom always says it's rude to invite myself for dinner. I'm not a judge, Maggie. You don't have to call me, Your Honor. Well, my dad says that you will be one soon, so we better start getting on your good side. Especially since we put in our pool last summer, and we didn't get a permit for it. Well, I guess I wasn't supposed to tell anyone that. Well, consider it bound by attorney/client privilege. I won't tell a soul. Really? Thanks, Your Honor. So, what is it that you wanted to tell me, Dad? That, that can wait. But you said it couldn't wait? I guess I did, didn't I? well, honey, here's the thing. I met someone. A girl, a woman. And, I... I've gotta go. Thanks for dinner, Your Honor. Call me tomorrow, bye. Listen, Aman... your mother's been gone for two years now, and I'm allowed to... Her name is Erica, and I've known her professionally for a really long time now, and over the past several months, you know, things have just really clicked. And I didn't want to say anything to you until I was sure, but you know, now I am, I'm, I'm sure. I asked her to marry me. Amanda. Amanda. Amanda? Honey? Listen, I'm sorry I sprung it on ya like that. I haven't... It was the wrong way to approach it. Anyway, I'm really sorry. And we'll talk more in the morning, okay? Okay? Well, I love you. Amanda? Amanda, sweetie, wake up. Mom? Have you seen my hairbrush, Amanda? I can't leave for the show until I find it. Help me look for it, Amanda. I can't be late for the championships. I think I left it right here. Found it. Mom? I found the brush. Where is Max, Amanda? Mom? Amanda, I can't find Max. Mom, I don't understand? Max. hello, Amanda. Who are you? I'm Erika, I, and it's so nice to finally meet you. Where's my dad? Well, Amanda, an extremely important client called Peter, your father, very late last night. He didn't wanna wake you, but he needed to go to Chicago. Do you know where Chicago is? Since like the second grade. Certainly. Of course you know where Chicago is, I'm Sorry, I, I'm a little new to, regardless, he needed to be there, so he asked me to watch you. He thinks he should be back late night. The toast is burning, Erika. What? No, no, no, no, no. Hey, Max. Maxie, I brought you some scrumptious breakfast. Max? Max? No. Are you okay, Maxie? Breakfast is ready. I can't, I told my aunt I would help out at the animal shelter. Don't you have school? Nope. Teacher inservice, of something like that. Well, at least let me drive you. No, it's okay. My friend Maggie and I walk sometimes. It's not far. Your father lets you do that? Yep, as long as we promise to stay together. Well, Mrs. Crabtree will watch you just until I get back from work. Okay, bye. So you found the little guy sick in backyard? - Yep. - And your dad told you, you have some strange woman, too. - Yep. - And now she's in - your house? - Yep. Girlfriend, you're having one seriously bad day. He's going to be just fine. I've given him some fluids and a dewormer. He'll be good as new after he gets some rest. Thanks, Aunt Kathy. Amanda, I, you're extremely lucky. Don't give me that look. He seems tame enough. My guess is that he was hand-reared by a breeder, but he could have just as easily been raised in the wild with wild parents protecting him. Do I really need to explain to you how dangerous that could have been if that had been the case? Foxes generally don't attack humans, but what if he had been diseased? Promise me that next time you will tell an adult right away. Deal? I will. Alright, lecture over. I bet you named him, didn't you? Max. Girlie, that's a wonderful name. Well, I got Max a crate, so you can transport him home safely, and I'll make a list of supplies that your dad will need to get for you, but frankly I'm surprised he's even letting... He doesn't know, does he? He's in Chicago. Well, who's watching you, then? What? Who is it? Mrs. Crabtree? Grandpa? Erika. So he told you, then? You knew? That's not the point. Alright, I'll come by the house with some supplies tonight, but you need to tell your dad and Erika as soon as possible. Okay. Seriously. I mean it. I know, I will. Good. Now I need to get back to work, so off with you two troublemakers. Go on. They are wrong. But you can see that the fox tracks are still here. Even with the rain. Do you see? If it was there, it would jump up and bite you. No, I see it, I see it. We stop for lunch soon, yes? I take a long time to sneak this fox into this country. - Yes. - The Americans, they pay too much moneys for this variable creature. Do you want variable fox and too much moneys? You want to fill your belly full of food. Fill belly full of food, final answer. Not final answer. We continue to search for fox kitty. Move. So, what was all that oogie stuff back there about your fox being named Max? Oogie? Yeah, ya know? Well, it's kind of a secret. A secret? C'mon, it's me, Maggie, your BFF. Remember? If you can't tell me your secrets, who can you tell? I know, it's just one last thing I have between me and my mom. It's dumb, but. You get off my property. Please, please don't miss undertake me, kind lady. How you say? - Foxy. - We think you foxy. My. Well, you are rather strong, aren't you? Yes, Dimitri very strong. I protect whole neighborhood against kittys, vicious, dangerous animals. That's a lie. What are you doing? Foxes are not vicious. They're shy and playful, and go out of their way to avoid humans. No, no, no, little girl. Not this fox. This fox very dangerous. You know, this morning, Boris and Dimitri, we find a, how you say? The den. A fox den with many bones and fur from animal's it's eaten and cats, even. No, it's not lie. One they tried to bite my face off. Stop. What, what is it you have inside box? Nothing. We will be seeing what is underneath blanket. No, you will not. Hey. C'mon, girls, you two go in the backyard, and play with the rabbits. And you animal catchers, you stay off my property. You here, or I'm calling the police, go, get, go. You will let us know if you see dangerous fox, yes? No. Be gone. C'mon, girls. ♪ You and me together we will be ♪ ♪ Inseparable ♪ And they can't tell us it must end ♪ ♪ Impossible ♪ We will play ♪ All day ♪ I have to say ♪ You're my favorite friend ♪ You don't have to ask me twice, of course ♪ ♪ You can come stay with me ♪ You can be my bestie and I'll be yours ♪ ♪ You can be Max and I'll be your little girl ♪ Too close. Here, kitty. Snake, snake, snake. - Boris, what's the matter? - Snake, snake. It really not the time to play on swing. C'mon. Wait. No. Slow down. It's too tight, tight around my neck. I think I'm more tuckered out than he is. Don't look now, those dogcatcher's are back. Why can't those boneheads just leave us alone? I have an idea. How quickly do you think we can cut across the yard to your house and get back here? Alright. Not you, doggie, you stay there. C'mon. Boris, Boris. C'mon, you okay? Hey, that dog is gonna come back. C'mon, we back here. Max? Max? Max? No. Mr Lincoln. What the? Gotcha. All tuckered out, Maxie? Me too. We had a long day. But it's a good kinda tired, you know? I sorta feel like everything's gonna work out. Like maybe I'll get to keep you. I just need to figure out the right way to ask my dad. Until then, you'll be my little secret, okay? And Maggie's. And Aunt Kathy's. But not Erika. She seems alright, but it might ruin things if I don't ask Dad about your first. And absolutely, positively not Mrs. Crabtree. So no more stealing wigs, got it? Good. Amanda? Amanda, it's time to get up. Mom, I have such wonderful news. I found him. Who, Amanda? Max, I found Max, Mom. I'm so happy for you. You have to meet him, I know you'll love him as much as I do. I swear he was right, Mom? He was right there a second ago. Really. Where's Max, Amanda? Mom? I'll be down in a minute. Amanda? May I come in? Just one second. I'd really like to talk to you, okay? What are you up to? Nothing, just playing. We can go downstairs, if you'd like to? No, right here's just fine. Stop. That's where Mr. Sparkles likes to sit. Of course. What is it that you wanted to talk about? I, there's something I wanted to say to you, but you were, you were in such a hurry, I didn't get the chan, cha... Excuse me. I'm sorry, must be something in the air. Anyway, I want you to know, that I love your father very much, and I want to marry him, but. Do you mind grabbing one of those for me? I don't know what my problem is. okay. Have you had any dogs in here lately? I usually only get this way around cats and dogs. What, get what way? I'm very allergic to animals. You are? Sometimes dangerously so, it it depends on the animal. I just remembered, I had Bernie up here a few days ago. He was a stray I found, well, He turned out just to be lost, but I let him get on my bed. Well, I'll wash your - blankets for you. - No, no, no, no, no, it's, it's, okay. Dad's always saying that I should take more responsibility. Amanda, I want you to know, that I can never replace your mother. I wouldn't want to, but I hope we can become close, alright? Okay. Good. I'll go make us some breakfast, okay. Eggs sound good? - Yes, yeah. - Alright, okay, yeah. Good morning, Max. Don't worry, I'll figure something out. Maybe she can get shots or something, but until then it would probably be best if I kept you in the backyard, but don't worry, I'll come out and play with you every hour. Don't you like your eggs? Yeah, sure. You haven't eaten very much. I guess I'm not as hungry as I thought I was. You know, when I was a little girl, I didn't meet my aunt until I was about your age. Really, why not? She was in the military. Stationed all over the world. And I remember being really worried about meeting her. I mean, here is this woman who had traveled the globe, she had had all these experiences. I didn't even know how to act in front of her. She must have been able to tell I was nervous because the first thing she did was ask me if I wanted to play a game. What kind of game? It's simple, really. You take the other person's hand, and then you share something about yourself, that you're normally too shy or embarrassed to tell people. Or maybe it's something personal. For instance, even though I love being a lawyer, anytime I have to go to court and talk in front of a jury, I get very, very nervous. Really? My palms start sweating. My mind, it goes completely blank, and then, I start stuttering, tha-a-a-nk you, Your H-H-Honor. I can research a case like nobody's business, but I'm completely useless as a lead attorney in the courtroom. Okay, your turn. Well, I guess there's Max. Is he a boy you know? No, he's a dog. Well, he was a dog. He was my mom's first show dog. He was really smart, I guess. He won best of breed. She said after he died, she never had a dog as smart as him. Sometimes I'd sit with her during her chemo, and we'd talk about how we'd get another dog someday. Name him Max. We'd train him together. Just her and me. He'd be the best dog ever. That was a wonderful story, Amanda. Thank you for sharing it with me. Sometimes I have dreams where she's asking me if I've found Max yet. Usually I feel bad because I haven't, but at least I get to see her, you know? Someday you'll find your Max. I'm sure. Erika? There's probably another Max that I should tell you about. Boy or dog? Neither. A fox? A fox? I am literally speechless right now. I have no idea what to say. For what it's worth, I wouldn't have let her bring it home if I thought the animal was going to... His name is Max. I wouldn't have let her bring Max home, if I thought it was the least bit dangerous, but she was supposed to clear this with both of you. But... No, not a word, Amanda. Where is it now? May I say a word? In his crate in the backyard. I'll keep the little guy until we can find him a good home. I am so disappointed in you. You have anything to say for yourself? I wanted to show you that I could take responsibility. By hiding a stray animal in our backyard, in our house? By lying to us, that kind of responsibility? Sorry. Sorry's not gonna cut it this time, kiddo. Go to your room until I decide what your punishment's gonna be. Could I at least say goodbye? Peter? He's gone. Boopy-boop-boop-boop-boop. Brother look at this. I wanted you. Idiot. Hey, look at that, what do you think they're looking for? I don't, they, they look for, for, lost doggie, maybe? No, I think this is girl. The, the other one, the friend with the mean dog. I don't like that dog. That's the girl where we think we see. - English kitty. - English kitty. Allergic? That's too bad. Dogs, mostly. And apparently, foxes. I hope we can get to know each other better. As family. I'd like that very much. I hope Peter's not too hard on her. Her heart's in the right place. I know, I know, she told me about your sister and Max. I wish there was something I could do about it. Hello, kind ladies. How you doing today? Not to be afraid. We see that you are searching for something. What is it that you are searching for? My stepdaughter lost her pet, that's all. Well we too are searching, and you know, you must be careful because we are searching for dangerous fox. Maybe you'll be seeing it? No, I haven't seen a fox. Haven't seen a fox? Well, okay, well if you be seeing it, you, you let us know, yes? - Okay. - Okay. - B-bye. - B-bye. B-bye. USA, number one. America, Rolling Stone. Those are the two Amanda described, right? They're definitely not animal control, that's for sure. I have a feeling we better find Max before they do. I'm sure he'll be okay. Heck, if he's half as smart as you say he is, he'll probably end up back in his crate by the morning, anyway. You do know, though, if he comes back, we can't keep him, right? Cause of Erika? No. Well sort of, but mostly it's because he's a fox. I mean, even if you did decide to raise him as a pet, you know, they're not like dogs. They need a lot more room, and they need a lot more care and a lot more attention. Or at least I think they do, I don't know, I mean he's a fox. It's just not in the cards. You know, not until you're much, much older can you decide whether you're ready to take that much responsibility for another living creature. You know, sometimes doing what's right for someone or something, you know, it feels like we're not doing the right thing for ourselves. I didn't wanna get on a plane, and go to Chicago for a pro bono job, you know? But, Mr. Olivier's, really nice man, and if I didn't help him out, he would lose the bakery that he spent his entire life trying to build, and then he and his family, they would have nothing. And going to Chicago meant that I would have to leave you, but I knew it was the right thing to do. Does that make sense? I promised I wouldn't let anything bad happen to Max. Well, I'll tell you what, you know, Aunty Kathy will take care of him until we find a place for him, and you can help her. And then we won't give him to anyone until they promise that you can visit. How's that sound? Is that a deal? - Really? - Really. Goodnight, kiddo. I love you. Max? Boris, we've got to get this fox, otherwise we're gonna be really in big trouble. You know why? Because we put too much moneys for this. Now what we gonna do? Hey. Watch, okay? - Okay. - We going to be in big troubles because we gonna have to hitchhike back to Russia. Is that what you want? No. Then no more stupid stuff, okay? Okay. Watch it. It's what I'm telling you, no stupid. C'mon now, pay attention. Don't call me names. Alright, but you got to... I don't like names. Stop, keep moving, look for fox. Boris, I tell you how many times? How many times I tell you? What's a matter with you now? I believe it is you who is watching now? Are you crazy? Get that outta my face. Help me up now. Freeze. Hello, kind policeman. How are you doing tonight? USA, number one. Get on the ground, now. Get down on the ground. Get down on the ground. Hands behind your back. Max? Max? My bunnies. Mrs. Crabtree, what? No. Some of the little ones are gone. My poor bunnies. It was that wicked fox, I know it was. They warned us how dangerous it is. No, Mrs. Crabtree, it couldn't have been him. He would never do - something like... - Amanda. But? Look, we don't know what happened, and foxes do eat rabbits. - We have to assume... - He would never do something like this. He wouldn't. Such a nice girl for helping me with this. Would you like a snack? I'm okay. Well, if you need anything, you let me know, okay? I called the real animal control an hour ago, but you keep an eye out for that vicious beast. You'd never do anything like this, Max. I know you wouldn't. You're a gentle, kind fox, and I don't know how yet, but I'll prove it. Get, you get outta here. Go on. Go, go. Go on, get. Max. Max, no. He's trying to save us. - Max. - Amanda, no. He's too small, he's gonna get hurt. Get behind, get back. Get back, that's a coyote. Got 'em. Max. It's just a tranquilizer gun, alright? - Two for two. - He was protecting us. It's okay, hon, it's over now. It will be okay. It's alright, it's okay, shh. It's alright, it's alright, it's alright. Alright, so, I just got off the phone with the county shelter, and they have minimal staff on the weekend, so Max will be fine until the work week, but if there's no court order by Monday... They'll put him down. I'm afraid so. But, you have to stop them. Honey, I'm sorry, but I have to get back on a plane to Chicago. Mr. Olivier's case is on Monday. No, you can't, Max needs you. Hold on, I'm not sure that you're aware of this or not, but you happen to have one of the best lawyers in the state sitting right next to ya. Me? Her? Peter, you've seen me in court. I'm a research - attorney, I can't... - Look, I'm not saying for you to be lead counsel on this. Who then? You wanted to prove to me that you could take responsibility, right? That you could handle this? Erika can help guide you, but I think that you should do the heavy lifting in this case. But, I... No, no buts. Do you wanna save Max or not? Then this is your moment, Amanda. You are a bright, intelligent young lady, and if you put half the energy into saving Max as you did into hiding him from us, he'll be free in no time. And I'll be right there with you the entire way. You can do this. I know you can. Then what are we waiting for? Let's get this party started. - That's my girl. - Alright. - Alright. - Alright, excellent. - Alright. - Alright. Okay. Good, let's get to work. Wow, that's some heavy lifting alright. It's not as bad as it looks. We just need to take this one step at a time, and our first priority, is to convince Judge Weartherbee that we need a few days to put our case together. That will also buy Max a little more time. And then what? Then we develop an argument as to why Max isn't a menace and danger to the community. If the judge agrees, he'll let Max go free. And if he doesn't? One step at a time, remember? Hey? Hey? Don't underestimate the sheer awesomeness of our secret weapon. What secret weapon? You, silly. Do you think I'm ready? Have you done your absolute best to prepare? Then you're going to do great tomorrow. Max is so lucky to have found you. Try to get some sleep, okay? Okay. Erika? Well, Dad and I are lucky to have found you, too. Amanda, I feel the same. Goodnight. All rise. The Court of the Honorable, Wilfred B. Weartherbee is now in session. All rise. Can't find my glasses, Frank. What? Use your words. You may be seated. Just remember everything we talked about, and you'll do fine. Miss King, is that you I see? Y-y-y-yes, Your H-H-Honor. And who's that you got with you? Amanda, Your Honor. Amanda Hart, I mean. You approved our request for me to act as lead counsel? I did? Yes, Your Honor, three days ago. That's highly unusual. I don't seem to have the paperwork. Must have left them. All rise. I have a copy, Your Honor, right here. I must have been in a charitable mood that day. Thank you, Your Honor. Alright, please be seated. Now, since it appears that most of the fifth grade class at Harris Hill Elementary has decided to join us, I would like to remind everyone that even though this is just a hearing not a trial, I expect complete silence from the gallery during the proceedings. Understood? Good. Good, now, we are here to determine whether the fox captured on, on... November 9th, sir. Yeah, on November 9. Whether this fox poses a danger to the community and must be euthanized, or whether it can be responsibly returned into said community. Any questions on that before we begin? Any questions for counsel? No, Your Honor. No questions, Your Honor. You may call your first witness. He was in very good shape, considering. A clean bill of health all and all. During the examination, he was perfectly friendly and tame. Your witness, Mr. Milkins. Miss Jones, since the fox has been at county, has anybody claimed to be its owner? Well, I only work at the county shelter when they're short staffed, so... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure, but has anybody claimed the fox as their owner? No. Not that I know of. Okay, no further questions, Your Honor. We played the whole afternoon with Max, I mean the fox, and he came up to me really friendly. Like when I first met him. He's a sweetie pie. Mr. Milkins? Yes. Miss? Margaret Cavanaugh. Yeah, sure, do you own the fox? Me? No, I have a dog. And do you know anyone who owns the fox? No. If I did, we wouldn't have spent all that time playing with him. Yeah, no further questions, Your Honor. What's he doing? He must think that if he can show that no one owns Max, then Max should be put down. Can't we say we own him? No, Amanda. That wouldn't be the truth. I'm sorry. I know. What do we do then? We just keep going, and hope that our argument is stronger than his in the end. You're doing great. Your Honor, I'd like to call... Brenda Killacky, and yes, I'd heard that there was a fox roaming around the neighborhood, so I called right away. Especially after poor Fluffers went missing. Fluffers is the cat that you told Animal Control had been taken by the fox? She's never been gone for so long before. Did you see the fox take her? Well, no. Ooh. What a pretty kitty. We found her at the shelter two days ago. You have to say for the record, is this your cat Fluffers, Mrs. Killacky? I thought you were giving him to me because I run the rescue operation. I, no, he's... This isn't Fluffers. But? No, sorry. If the shelter's gonna put him down, I'll take him. I'm a licensed rescue organization for up to ten cats. And with Fluffers being gone, well, I'm happy to take him. No further questions, Your Honor. Do you own the fox? No. Excuse me, Your Honor? What's going on here? We're character witnesses. Character witnesses? For a fox? He's a nice fox. And you're a very mean man. We can raise our hands and swear in, then repeat it if you need us to. No, that won't be necessary. Do any of you four own the fox? No, it's Amanda's fox. We'll see about that. Okay, this is the last witness before the judge deliberates. You're doing great, do you remember our strategy with her? Almost there. Finish strong. Mrs. Crabtree, I'd like to get one question out of the way right from the start. Of course, dear, what is it? Do you own the fox? Heaven's no. Last week, there were 14 complaint calls to animal control about Max, or the fox, and 12 of them were from you. Well, I don't know about that, I, I didn't count them, but, well I was really worried about my bunnies. I don't blame you, Mrs. Crabtree. I mean, there was a dangerous animal loose in the neighborhood, wasn't there? After everything that happened, do you still think it was Max? Well, right up until the time that that coyote attacked us, I would have said that the fox was a menace, but after the way he saved us, no, no, I don't think your fox is a danger to anyone. Thank you, Mrs. Crabtree. No further questions. Mr. Milkins? No questions, Your Honor. Very well. Does counsel have anything to add before I deliberate? Your Honor, I think I've shown that everything people thought about Max, that he was a mean, scary animal wasn't true. I know that there's still the missing cats, but there's no proof that he did that either. And we do know that there's a coyote in the neighborhood that hurt other animals and would have hurt humans, too. I'd also like to add, that it is legal to own foxes in this state. They're not seen as dangerous animals under the law. I promise that if you let me take Max until I can find a good home for him, nothing like this will ever happen again. Thank you, Miss Hart. Mr. Milkins? Your Honor, it is the county's opinion that his case is cut and dry. Foxes are classified as wild animals, period. You know, whether they're tame or not, they're still highly unpredictable and potentially dangerous. Now, the state does allow foxes to be kept as pets, but only under the strictest of circumstances. However, that's not what we have here. No one owns the fox as we've shown. And the plaintiff herself has admitted, that she was irresponsible in taking care of the fox in the first place. So, the county has no reason to believe that this will change. Therefore, we believe the fox is a menace, and should not be allowed back into the community. Very well. We'll take a 15 minute recess while I make my final decision. You made a very fine argument, young lady. You should be proud of that, but I should also warn you, that I'm inclined to rule in favor of the county at this point, but I will keep an open mind as I review the testimony. Hey, Amanda? I am so proud of you. No matter what happens. I'm sorry about the fox, Amanda. I wish my rescue license covered foxes. It wouldn't matter if he was wild or not. If I was zoned for a wildlife sanctuary, but I'm not. Sorry. Sanctuary, I know how to save Max. C'mon, I'll explain on the way. Will Miss Hart be joining us? Y-y-y-y-yes, Your Honor I, I. She'd like to ask for a few more minutes, Your Honor. C'mon, Your Honor. Why delay the inevitable? I'm trying to get nine holes of golf in this evening. I also have other appointments on my docket today, Miss King. You'll have to inform Miss Hart of my judgment when she arrives. Well, as much as I wish otherwise, I must regretfully say that I find the county's argument more compelling. Therefore, I ordered the fox to be... Your Honor, I have it. What exactly do you have, Miss Hart? The license, they still had it at the clerk's office for a wild animal sanctuary. A sanctuary named Max and Me. It was started by my mom and my aunt. Thanks, Mom. They don't expire, Your Honor, and my aunt would like to provide sanctuary for Max. Well, this changes everything, now doesn't it, Miss Hart? It does? Yes, and I expect you to have a proper enclosure within the week. Not a problem, Your Honor. Your Honor? Mr. Milkins, be seated. Yes, yes, this does change things, Miss Hart, and since no one has stepped forward to claim, Max, I hereby order that... Excuse me, please to excuse, kind sir? Now what? Hello. Excuse a, please, judge, your majesty. My brother and me, we have been, how do you say? - Detaining. - Detaining. No, no, detained. We have just been able to come here now, but if it is this fox you are talking about that's been running around town, well, we, my brother and me, well, we, we be owning this fox. We'd like a chance to question these men? Yes, yes, off course. - Yes. - Yes. Boo, I kidding. I have a certified health certificate from animal doctor and a receipt for be owning. But if you really owned the fox, then why did you say that you were from animal control? Because we were controlling this animal, until the, well, until my brother be losing it. We worry that, people will want reward for finding it if, but we get no monies, until we be bringing fox to new owner. So, we tell people he's dangerous, this fox. You're selling him? Yes, to fox pen, north of here. Fox pen? What's that? It is, it is place for hunting with hound doggies. No, Your Honor, you can't. Order, order. Let me remind you, that hunting has a long and proud tradition in this state. There's nothing illegal about what they're doing here. Yes, it's legal. We bring many foxes each year. Wait, Max is from Russia? Is that an electric device in my courtroom? If it pleases the court, Your Honor, I'm Amanda's father and a attorney. May I please question the witness? Why not? I've ignored every other law, rule and regulation today. Have at it. Sir, you say that you're a citizen of Russia? Yes, we are neighbors from across the borders. Then, where's your International Broker's License from the Department of Fish and Wildlife? But, I don't know this thing. Well, Your Honor, without an International Animal's Brokers License, they're not allowed to bring wild animals into the United States. Therefore, the fox must be considered smuggled contraband, which means... Which means they forfeit their ownership rights. I hereby order the fox be remanded into the custody of the Max and Me Sanctuary. - Yes. - Where I hope he will live a long and happy life. Do you know what today is? It's my father's wedding. I'm gonna have a stepmom, and you're gonna have an aunt. Amanda, time to go. Coming. Amanda? I'll be right there. I swear, you'd miss your own father's wedding just to spend a little more time with Max.
