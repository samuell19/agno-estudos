♪♪♪ [mewls] tater tot, I love you, but you have the worst timing to need snuggles. -[sighs] -[mewls] okay. I just can't resist your golden deliciousness. [purring] I have to go help bring babies into the world. [meows] no, you're not getting a brother. Stop asking. [meows] [knock on door] sawyer, got a minute? Always for you, bill. You've had a busy month. Yes, I have seen a lot more patients thanks to you, and then we hired Jules, the epitome of efficiency. And you've extended your office hours. True, but you know I don't have much else going on, so why not? That's what I wanna talk to you about. [door closes] oh, no, are you and bonnie trying to set me up again? Because I cannot take another blind date. The last one... [sighs] was a dumpster fire. [laughs] no, no, we wouldn't dare. -Okay. -I came to tell you bonnie and I have decided it's time. I'm announcing my retirement at the end of this year. Wow. I wasn't expecting that. Yeah, me neither, but bonnie's ready to do the things we haven't done because of my work. So now I need to decide who'll take over my practice. Oh. Right. Well, if we're voting, I vote for me. Sawyer, you're an amazing doctor, top of your field in high-risk pregnancies. Your patients adore you. I couldn't be more proud. But? See, the thing is this clinic has been my baby for over 40 years, and now that I'm retiring, it's my legacy, and I worry about turning it over to someone who's already chasing burnout, because this is just gonna make the job harder. And it would break my heart if all that went away. I need someone who has a work-life balance. Oh, I've got balance. I'm headed to lunch with Gemma and Camille later. And when was the last time you took lunch? We need something outside of work to help rebuild us on the hard days, or they'll all become hard days and then impossible days. I would've sunk without my family. I-I'm sorry. I-I wasn't thinking. I know you miss your dad, and your mom's away on that sabbatical for the university. Sorry. It's... So... [sighs] I'll be considering candidates and announce the new boss at my retirement party. [door opens] oh. That reminds me. Bonnie decided to turn our office Christmas party into my retirement party. You totally deserve that. So take these next few weeks to make your best case. Maybe join a bowling league. Ew. Rented shoes? [laughs] [sighs] I miss you, dad. So the base doctor was worried about hypertension? [beep] well, you've come to the best. [door opens] -speak of the devil. -[door closes] probably not a good idea to call your new boss the devil. Hi, Hillary. So good news. The blood work I had you do is normal. -[sighs] -oh, I'm sorry. Should we wait for your husband, um, kyle, right? Oh. That'd be quite the wait. He's deployed right now. Oh, wow. Will he be here for this little guy's entrance? We never know, but it's not likely. Mm, I'm sorry. So hard. But my big brother lives in Heber city, and he's gonna be coming for this last month. And my mom's gonna fly out as soon as the baby comes, so that's gonna make things much easier and the holidays way less lonely. Absolutely. Okay, let's have you lie back. [chair whirs] so have you noticed any specific triggers for your blood pressure? Uh...Tying my shoe, trying to sit up, running out of rocky road, being married to a soldier. No offense if you're married to one. Sawyer's married to her job. Neither of us are married. Oh. I just assumed that smart, pretty ladies like you would've been snatched up. That's fair. Well, my dad set the bar pretty high, plus my cat can be super picky, and... He hasn't given anyone his blessing yet, so still single. Well, my brother's single and loves cats. -Oh, shocked he's single. -Tell me he loves musicals, and I've just found the man of my dreams. He actually played Jean Valjean in a production of "les mis." -I could set you guys up. -Uh, I'm more team Javert. No one's team Javert, especially after Russell Crowe's performance. Plus, you know, doctor, patient...it's messy. Technically, he's not your patient. -And I'm so busy all the time. -Too busy for coffee? Yeah, 'cause I'm gonna be interviewing nurses for a job that just opened up. [chuckles] well, he's going to be in town until this baby arrives, so if you change your mind... Your ultrasound looks good. The baby's the perfect size. Good fluid levels. We just need to monitor you for headaches, abdominal pain, and keep an eye on your blood pressure. So just take it easy, okay? Let your brother do all of the holiday shopping, decorating, wrapping. Small problem there. He avoids Christmas. Loves cats but avoids Christmas? Right? Well, then, Hillary, just listen to your body. If you start feeling anxious, sit down, and you gotta focus on your breathing. Everything can wait until your body says okay, okay? -Okay. -Okay. I wanna see you back here in one week, but call in the meantime if anything comes up. [door opens] -[door closes] -I really like her. She's okay. [chuckles] ♪ hark the herald angels sing... ♪ a birthday toast to Gemma. May you finally show your age. Uh...Thanks, I think? Also, a toast to our Camille. Cheers on getting engaged again. Hopefully third time's a charm. Feel free to rewrap my last gift. -I already regifted it. -Of course you did. Hey, a toast to sawyer for being the best maid of honor that a girl could ask for. -Oh, it's my turn this time? Oh. Well, cheers to that. -[laughs] -you know what? Someday it's gonna be my turn for you. Speaking of, any men in your life at the moment? [crunches] one. Ooh. Wait. That's just in time for your marathon of misery being the only single person at holiday parties. You've really gotta shorten that title, but... -Yeah. -What's his name? [crunching] tater tot. Oh. You cannot take your cat to the parties. So the marathon of misery's still on then. That's what she's telling us. Yes, but Dr. Timothy... he's retiring, and he's looking for someone to take over his practice. So it might be a very merry Christmas to me. And to us, 'cause you're clearly rich, and you're gonna buy us lunch. Yeah, but then you won't have any sort of a social life. I'm out to lunch right now. Yeah, we are taken, so... And you're not really my type. A rich doctor is not your type? And yet you've married two of them. -Oh! -Look how that turned out. Ah! Ah! It is time for an intervention. -I wanna marry these chips. -[gasps] -[crunches] -mnh-mnh. [groans] I thought you were buying me dinner. I said, "wanna grab dinner?" I just need to find a gift for yet another wedding. It's got to be tough being so well loved. You get invited to people's most important events. I know I sound bitter. It's just, I'm here getting something for Sarah, my cousin's daughter. So I get left in the dust by my peers, and now I'm being lapped by their kids. I just wanna know when someone's gonna buy me a vacuum. Well, first you have to date, and that would require you to work less, but that's your new plan, right? -Work-life balance? -It has to be, so I can convince Dr. Timothy I'm the right choice. So just work that hard at dating. It becomes a relationship, then an engagement, then a registry. Bing, bang, boom. You get a vacuum. I've dated, okay? The good ones are taken. And I don't think that I should have to settle just to get my turn to use the scan gun. If you want your turn with the scan gun, I'm gonna get you that turn. I'm not marrying you, Jules. [chuckles] like you'd be so lucky. I was just gonna say, just make a registry. For what, my never-gonna-be- a-bridal shower? You get to scan everything you want and release that bitterness. Trust me, it'll be very cathartic. I can't, 'cause little detail... I'm not engaged. Semantics. It'll be therapeutic. No sane person would do that. Email address. [scoffs] use my spam one. Okay, dreamysawyer. [chuckles] what... what's your fiancé's name? Oh, gosh, this is a dumb idea. No, this is a good idea. And we've made it private anyways. No one will ever see it, so who cares? Just give me the name of your last boyfriend. Mm, been a while, and it was fiancé. Whoa! Details. Joshua who thought his career was more important than mine. -The end. -[beep] let's do this. My fiancé's name is Joshua Gotaway? As in the one who got away. I'm the one who got away. [beeping] [beep] [beep] [beep] [beep] [beep] [beep] could you set her up for induction tomorrow? -Yeah, I'll take care of it. -Great. Thanks, Naomi. [door closes] hi, Dr. Ames. Hillary, so good to see you again. -I'll be right in. -Sawyer, my spies report you've been here late every night this week. They are... Liars? [chuckles] have you ever heard of the saying, "work to live. Don't live to work"? I love my work. And that's admirable, but it's also not everything, and you deserve to have everything. Excuse me, Dr. Timothy? There's a Dr. Marcus Robinson here for you regarding an interview. Please, show him to my office. And I'd better not find out that you came in this weekend. Do something fun. Well, you couldn't pay me to be here. But only because I have plans, 'cause otherwise I would be here every minute, because this is the best place ever! Smooth. And how have you been sleeping? -Barely. -Just a little something you can hang over the baby's head forever. -[laughs] -okay, Jules is no longer allowed to give parenting advice. [laughs] [knock on door] sorry. I got stuck on a phone call. Can I help you? That's my brother Landon. Come in. I'm decent. Oh, well, that's debatable. ♪♪♪ [sighs] oh! Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. Yep, I'm good. -I'm great. -[under breath] great-looking. Landon James, this is Dr. Ames. Oh, fun. Your names rhyme. -Hi. -Nice to meet you. And this is Jules, my nurse. So, Landon, what do you do that lets you take a whole month off? I might need to switch careers. He's a vet. Oh. Um... Thank you for your service. [chuckles] she means veterinarian. Oh! [laughs] I just assumed with her husband being... Soldiers. [laughs] that's okay. I-I own a clinic in Heber, so the other doctors can cover for me. It's the perks of being the boss. So I wanna check your iron and sugar levels again and run a hypertension panel, but I still want you to take it easy, okay? So when do you think she'll get her lab results back? I can put a rush on them, and I'll call tomorrow. -You work every weekend? -Oh, no, just on call. I try to find a work-life balance. -Since when? -Since tomorrow. You know what might help with that? Getting coffee with Landon. Wow, uh, you didn't just say that. I feel anxious when I'm napping with you around, Landon. I feel like I should be keeping you company, but if you were his company, then I could nap anxiety-free. A good doctor would help out. Okay, you guys are ganging up on me now? On us. So...You don't wanna get coffee? Uh... He would love to. Say 11:00? Apparently I'm free tomorrow. I'm not an ax murderer, if that's what you're worried about. I wasn't until you felt the need to assure me that you're not. He has cats. How dangerous can he be? I'm gonna kill you, Hillary. Kill? So just a murderer, not an ax murderer. I feel much safer now. I promise he's a really great guy. Tomorrow sounds great. [telephone ringing in distance] shall I come over after work and help you pick out a coffee outfit? Oh, I have my Christmas kickoff dinner with the girls. Yeah, call me after, and we'll pick it. That's silly! It's just coffee. [scoffs] at your age, it's never just coffee. At my age? [laughter in distance] you guys, how come I'm the only one who can't know where we're eating dinner? Doesn't a blindfold imply this is a surprise? We promise, you're absolutely gonna love it. So help me if this is a blind date, I am never speaking to you again. -[laughs] -serious. All right, ready? -Yes. -One...Two... All: Surprise! -[laughter] -what is going on? [laughter] oh, Sarah! This, um, this party is for you? No, it's for you. I found your registry when I went to update mine. My registry. I hadn't heard you were getting engaged. So I called Gemma, who was shocked. We called Camille, who was stunned. Obviously, you weren't telling people yet, but we just couldn't wait to celebrate you. We are so happy for you. -Double wedding...half the price. -This cannot be happening. -We know what you're thinking. -I doubt that. "this can't be happening, not without my mom." well...Come on out, Margaret! Sweetie! -Aah! [laughs] -mom. Goodness! When the girls emailed me to tell me about the party, well, first, I was floored. And then I realized you were probably waiting to tell me about Joshua in person, and so I rushed home to be with you! [laughs] oh! You didn't even tell me you were seeing someone. Can you believe his name is Joshua as well? Oh, I know, right? Sawyer, this isn't something that you hide. Why didn't you tell us? Because, you guys, I'm not really... -[music playing] -[gasps] oh! You finally get to use your wedding song! [voice breaking] I think I'm gonna cry. [laughs] here's your cake.

[laughs] listen, you deserve the absolute best. Well, I wanna hear all the details. -Tell us how you met. -How did he ask you? -Wait. What does he do for work? -Where's your ring? Okay, I don't have one because... it all just happened so fast. -Aw! -[laughter] well, when do I get to meet him? [mouth full] mmm. Sorry. [mumbling] [mumbles] mm-hmm. Dr. Ames. I'm on my way. -[all groan] -you guys, good news. Good news! A baby is on his way, and I have to get to the hospital. Um, mom, can I borrow your car? Of course. [laughs] oh, I'll bring the gifts to your house. Oh, you guys didn't need to get me gifts. -You should take 'em back. -Will you stop it? After all the gifts you've gotten everybody else? We are literally dying to spoil you. Love you guys! [cheers and applause] [door closes] Jules, hi. Yeah, I'm just calling to let you know that we are no longer speaking because of that registry you made me make that no one was ever gonna see? Yeah. Oh, yeah, someone saw it. We are so in a fight. [cellphone beeps] ugh! I brought sugar cookies to say sorry. You brought dough. I have to do it all? ♪♪♪ -okay, come in. -[whispers] yes. And they played my wedding song I've been saving for my real wedding, not some misguided fake registry suggested by my...Friend. [scoffs] I thought we moved past this. Besides, it is not my fault, okay? I called the store. They explained their registry system glitched, and they fixed it quickly. They sent an email to let everyone know they needed to log in and reset their registry privacy settings. Well, dreamysawyer doesn't check that email account. [mouth full] you know, I don't know how to fix this. I just couldn't tell them the truth because they were all so happy for me. Can we talk about how I wasn't even invited? Huh? Are you ashamed of me? It was a surprise shower. -Mm. -I didn't give them names. But yes. And now I've made things so bad, and when bill finds out, he'll never trust me with his clinic. How could he? I'm a big, fat liar. Could Joshua break up with you before anyone meets him? There is no Joshua. Just have a fake fight with Joshua and tell everyone he dumped you. Why can't I be the dumper, hmm? You'll get more pity as the dumpee. -Oh, yeah, good point. -Mm-hmm. Man. I can't even keep a fake boyfriend. No. I wanna marry this dough. You've...you've had enough.

I suppose you'd like an explanation, huh...Sweetie? Oh, it's okay. You can tell me at our catering tasting. Ugh.

Yeah, and I'd always wanted to go to the u of u for med school. -Oh, great program. -And when Josh said he'd make enough money for both of us, and I didn't need to go to med school, that's when I definitely knew we weren't on the same page. So I guess we both know how that conversation ended. And in his defense, his mother was a homemaker, but in my family, my dad supported my mom 100% when she went back for her PhD in anthropology. So do you have any regrets after seeing him? I don't know. I mean, I never thought I'd be single this long. -Mm. -And, uh... In my lonely moments, I sometimes wonder if Josh is the one who got away.

Why would you do that for me? Well, I'm part to blame for the current state of things, plus your mom...she's probably telling everybody she knows that we're aiming for a honeymoon baby. Yeah, thanks for that. So let me help you out. Plus I'm a catch. I'm a gentleman, I'm a quiet eater, and animals love me, so... Sawyer ames... Will you be my fake fiancée?

[lowered voice] everybody hates wassail, but it takes a long time to make. Hillary: Really? Wassail? Yeah! I'd love it! Hillary: Okay! [lowered voice] so I didn't tell Hillary that people think I'm your fiancé Joshua. -Why not? -I started to explain it to her one night, and she just started crying. When I asked her what was wrong, she said she's so relieved that I have you. -You have me... -Yeah. Apparently, it's been weighing on her that I was giving up my life to be here, and now it's like she did me a favor by introducing us. Since we're dating, it's not such a sacrifice, and I-I just couldn't tell her. She was crying. Oh, gosh. Kryptonite tears. Look, I know you're just as concerned as I am about her anxiety levels, and trust me when I say that it's...it's helpful for her and the baby if we just tell her that we're dating... As Landon and sawyer. Or team ames-James, as she calls us. Oh, gosh. Just when you think t can't get any more complicated. Yeah. Look, she only leaves the house to go to the office. So as long as we keep things from her there, she should be blissfully ignorant, okay? [sighs] [imitates crying] oh, gosh. Hillary: Forget the crib! Let's make cookies instead! [gasps] cookies! Yeah. Cookies are my love language! Come on. Okay. Girl on tv: Can you tell me the story now? I can't wait till Christmas eve without grandpa being here. Have you set a wedding date yet? Not yet. [crunching] but you're thinking sooner rather than later, right? We're just enjoying being engaged for now. Hmm. Watch the movie. It's a good part. Woman: You're growing up too fast, Millie. You know, pygmies don't have long engagements. -I think that's so smart. -Mom... It's just an academic observation. Woman: Christmas... Christmas isn't about what's happening around us. It's about what's happening inside... But? So I had some wedding ideas. So I was thinking for a theme, you might like "starry night," like your favorite painting. You could have your ceremony at night under the stars. [gasps] -[sighs] -hmm. Oh, wow. You really put a lot of thought into this. [laughs] I know. Hmm. In china's uyghur culture, the groom... he takes three arrows, and he shoots them at his future bride. Of course, they don't have arrowheads. And then he takes them, and he breaks them to ensure their love will last forever. Yeah, that's not happening, so... In France, they drink champagne out of a toilet to give them strength before the wedding. Okay, anthropologists probably shouldn't be wedding planners. Well, you've certainly done a great job keeping Landon out of my hair. -I'm standing right here. And it definitely makes girl talk a lot harder with you right there. Hey, we're almost done here. Can you pull the car around, save me a few steps? No. I know what you're doing. Whatever the patient needs. -Thank you. -Fine. -[door opens] -[chuckles] -[door closes] -so he's pretty great, huh? He's really great. [laughter] -[telephone ringing] -Joshua. Joshua! Joshua. I've been calling you. Hi...Dr. Timothy. Sorry. I'm sorry. Uh, yeah. I-I stopped by to see if sawyer was free for lunch, but, uh, they said she's with a patient, so... I'll just see her tonight. -Nonsense! Should might as well say hi as long as you're here. Follow me. Anyway, we could not stop laughing. Landon is so fun. I don't know how he stayed single so long. That's not my story to tell, but I'm sure that there are so many women who are kicking themselves for letting him go. I would hate myself if I did that. Oh, really? -[knock on door] -Dr. Timothy: Dr. Ames? May I see you for a minute? We'll see you back here next week, Hillary. Okay. Bye, Hillary. Bill, is everything okay? -Surprise. -[chuckles] -hi, sweetie. -What are you doing here? -I... -He wants to take you to lunch. Oh! Ugh! I wish I could, but, uh... I have another patient right now, so, uh, how about instead, I, uh, walk to your car while we... Canoodle? [chuckles] be back in a minute, boss! This is getting so crazy. [dog barking in distance] again, thank you so much for coming. -Of course. -I feel bad stealing you away from Margaret's game night. Ellie got a fever, and we felt like we couldn't have our elderly neighbor come babysit, you know? -Yeah. -Yeah, if it were anything other than my office Christmas party, we'd skip it. Hey, it's no problem, okay? We told my mom that we'd make it up to her. All right, um, Ellie's already in bed. She's asleep. -Okay. -Gracie goes down about 8:00. And we'll be back about... Half 11? Like midnight? Okay, stop worrying. We got this. Go have fun. Okay. All right. Listen, my darling, go and brush your teeth. Mwah. You listen to your auntie sawyer. Mwah. And you go to potty before bed. And you're not mine. -It's okay. -[laughs] sorry. But I will go potty before bed, I promise. Good to hear it. All right. All right, bye. Mommy loves you. Be good. -Have fun. Don't worry. -Daddy loves you, too. -Thank you. -Bye. So, grace... What do you wanna play? -[door closes] tea party. You can be the jester, and you can be the queen. Oh, my gosh. This is my favorite game. -Who's gonna be the princess? -Me. And my mom said life's not fair. And I said, well, that's not fair. Well, sounds like you handled it as well as could be expected at 5. I made pb&j with the crusts cut off, just like you like 'em. -Ooh. Thanks for the lovely spread, auntie sawyer. -You are very welcome. -Wow. Well, these look amazing. I will... she takes after her auntie sawyer. -Well, I'm gonna have one. -Ah-choo! -Oh. -Oh. Okay. No, I'm fine. This is gross, but birth is fine? No, I-I gotta go. -Sorry. -She's not okay. -I just need a moment. -[giggles] -so... -[coughs] ...Your mom called, told me to make you this. Passion fruit and onion tea that she discovered from the dominion republic? [sniffs] ew. Oh, yeah. [sigh] you should leave before you catch this plague. You don't wanna get Hillary sick. You know what's funny? Is that you caught the girls' cold, but grace sneezed all over me. I... I think you're a featherweight. Or...You're superman. -Ohh. -[sneezes] I think I like your explanation better. Look, you don't need to stay, okay? I've been taking care of myself for years. I'm good. Go take care of Hillary. No. Hillary's fine. She's hanging out with friends. Besides, what kind of fake fiancé would I be if I didn't take care of you when you had the featherweight plague? [laughs] [coughs] -yeah. -Don't make me laugh, you jerk. -I'm sorry. -[sighs] look, I am not going anywhere till your mom comes back. So just let me take care of you. [tater tot purrs] oh, hi, buddy. Where have you been? Yeah, there you... oh, yep, there you are. So...How does the food network sound? -I love that channel. -I think you mentioned that. -I did? -Yeah. Sarah and drew's Christmas party during trivia. -[tv playing indistinctly] -you know what "sous vide" was because you always watched "iron chef America" with your dad during his chemo treatments. You remembered. Of course. Oh! I love this show. Is this okay? [tater tot purring] it's perfect. [knock on door] you seem like you're feeling better. -Joshua take good care of you? -He really did. It was nice. I want you to know I'm done interviewing candidates to take over the practice, and I've made my decision. Oh. Sawyer, you care deeply, and you work hard with intention and true integrity. And you found that thing outside of work to help rebuild you. I'm proud to hand off this clinic to you. I don't know what to say. Say you'll convince Joshua to join us at the party, and invite your mom, Gemma, and Camille for the announcement. They'll be proud. [deep voice] get in my stomach! [normal voice] oh, hello, Dr. Timothy. Sorry. I haven't eaten in two hours. Don't let me get in the way. [mouths words] thanks for getting this. How much do I owe you? -$19. -For a lunch special? You ordered two and a soup. For me? You shouldn't have. Of course I should. [door closes] [sighs] so what was that all about? He said I'm getting the practice. -[gasps] -but it's not right. He only said it because he thinks I'm engaged. That's not true. You're one of the best doctors he's ever worked with. He says that all the time. [sighs] I need to tell him. Whoa, whoa, whoa. The engagement may not be real, but Landon seems like the real deal. He's really amazing. And you seem pretty happy. -Annoyingly so. -So keep dating Landon, and maybe there won't be anything to tell. We're not really dating. He's just, like, helping me out. I bet your wontons he's not just helping you out. And I bet your hot and sour soup he's just a nice guy with time to kill. There's only one way to settle this. Ask him on a proper date. If he says yes, he likes you. If he says no, it's 'cause you're not performing in front of your friends. Well, he'll say yes because he's a nice guy. Okay, fine. Ask him on a date, then kiss him. That'll tell you if it's real. No, that'll make it awkward. You're just looking for excuses. The wontons are mine. Fine. I'll ask him, and then you'll owe me your soup. Fine. [cellphone chimes] hey, Landon, comma, wanna grab dinner tomorrow? Just the two of us, question mark? [chimes, messaging bloops] [squeals softly] -[messaging bloops] -[gasps] "would love to." [gasps] [messaging bloops] "but only if you let me treat." [crunches] wow, forgotten what it feels like to eat without an audience. Yeah, we've had a lot of group dinners lately, and all of them calling you "Joshua." should I say "Landon" before every sentence to make up for it? -Huh. Yeah? So, Landon, what made you wanna be a vet? Well, sawyer, when I was a teenager, I rescued a baby squirrel, and when he got better, of course, I-I released him. [sighs] he would occasionally come back and say hi. That's when I knew I wanted to work with animals, and I'm...I'm really satisfied with my career. That's amazing. -Squirrels scare me. -What? Nut-storing rats with really poufy tails? Horrifying. [chuckles] you've got some really weird fears. Hey, guys, can I take your order? Yes, Janine, thank you. What do you have that sawyer won't steal half of? You say steal. I say testing for quality assurance. You're welcome. Let's...Do your pot pie. Okay. And for the lady? Um, I would love your Salisbury steak. [groans] said no one ever. Ha! Nobody steals my food. Oh, and he definitely needs a slice of your s'mores pie, please. -You got it. -Thanks. It's like you've known me forever. Can I ask you a personal question? -Yeah, sure. -I know why things didn't work out with you and Josh, but how is that you're still single? Aside from your irrational fear of squirrels and your love for Salisbury steak? Well, um, I was really busy with med school, and then when my dad passed away, I just...I couldn't open my heart again for a really long time. And when I was finally ready, the few first dates I did have never really seemed to turn into second dates. I guess I don't make the best first impression. Well...You can be a bit intimidating. What? You're a pretty complete package, and guys need to feel needed. I guess when you've spent years taking care of yourself, it's... Hard to let someone else take care of you. Apparently, I haven't learned to, uh, let my guard down. You've been pretty open with me. Well, sure, but I mean, you came into my life at a very vulnerable moment when I was forced to ask for help, and then you didn't run away. I'm no dummy. I saw a chance to spend time with you, and I took it. When do you want your s'mores pie? She'll wanna start with my dessert. [chuckles] it's like you've known me forever. -Feels nice. -Yeah. Just the two of us. I had a great time, but how can I not? Food and your company... my two favorite things. Oh, but Hillary...she won't like being number three. Well, you didn't let me finish. My two favorite things next to my most favorite thing... my sister. Seamless. [both chuckle] well, I better get going. I've got a c-section scheduled first thing. Yeah. But, um, thanks for dinner. Thanks for asking me. It worked great. I asked. You paid. Maybe I've been dating all wrong. Or maybe you've been dating the wrong guys. -Good night. -Good night. You wanted to see me. What's this? [gasps] I knew it. So is he a good kisser? -[typing on keyboard] -oh! I love being right! [crunching] -rookie move. -[sighs] -[laughs] -well, this is my first time playing this game, so technically, I am a rookie. She's ruthless. She's the crocodile, and you are... [cellphone chimes] ...The slowest antelope at the watering hole, Landon. Landon? Who's Landon? It... Landin' on a spot you might want. -Oh! -What game are we playing again? [laughter] we're playing game over! Oh! Oh, okay. I-I think I figured this out. Great. Should we trim the tree now? Whoa! Hold on. You're not gonna give me a chance to beat you? Sure. I can win again, and then we can trim the tree. -[laughs] -you're a great sport, Joshua. You're a great everything. How is it that, uh, that you've stayed single so long? Well, actually, um... I'm divorced. It only lasted a few years. In fairness to her, I was...Finishing up vet school, proving myself at a clinic, and I just... Didn't give our marriage the attention it deserved. I know how hard that time is. Well, I'm sure you... you gave it your best. I did. I really did. Just wasn't enough. And she left on Christmas eve, so now this time of year, it's...it's hard 'cause it just reminds me of my failures and her saying over and over again that I'm the biggest mistake of her life, and...She will always regret it. Always. I guarantee her biggest regret is leaving you. I'm gonna get us some more chips. Anyone want more eggnog? No? Just me. [footsteps depart] I asked Hillary how it's possible that you're so amazing and still single, and she said that it wasn't her story to tell. I should've asked you sooner. I'm sorry. No. No, I-I...I don't think I was ready to talk about it until now. Guess a thing like that could make you pretty protective of your heart, huh? [chuckles] I guess that's why I keep saving cats. They'll always need me, and they won't leave me if I'm working late. -How many cats are you up to? Oof. What number doesn't make you wanna run? I'm not going anywhere. Gonna have to move quicker if you want privacy. -[clears throat] -man, you're slow. I gave you a solid 30 seconds. Next time, you give us a full minute. Well, here's the rest of your minute. -Go. -[laughs] -can't. -[laughing] I died of mortification. Do you know what? I think I'm finally ready to start celebrating. Let's trim the tree. Are you sure? Yeah. This has been the best Christmas I've had in a long time. You've got to have more ornaments than anyone I know. [laughs] well, next near a whole bunch will be put on the newlywed tree. -We're taking your ornaments? -Oh, no, just mine. We have a family tradition of getting a new one each year because when my parents first got married, they had none. We made ours the first year. -Yeah. You're holding one. -Oh. The idea being when I got married, I would take my own to my tree. That way, it wouldn't be bare, and since I still celebrate Christmas here, here they stay. Yeah, whole bunch of 'em. Mom. Hey, Joshua, she found you just in time. My tree can't take any more. [chuckles] [gasps] do you want your ornament for this year? [chuckles] here it is. And here I thought it would be a souvenir from your trip, but look, honey, it's, uh, "baby's first Christmas" one. Subtle, mom. Ooh, it doesn't have a year. [chuckles] oh, Joshua, I got your parents a gift, too. Are they back from their unplugged retreat? I-I would so love to video chat so we could all meet. Uh... -Uh, yeah, we...we can't. -Why? Well, my...my mom caught my dad with his cellphone. -Mm, on the... -So she extended their stay. Yeah, and who knows how long it'll take to break him of that addiction? Right? Your dad. [laughs] do you know I just read a study on smartphone usage within industrialized countries and its marital effects, and your mom...she's right. Oh, yeah. But you know, it's a bummer that it's taking this long to get together, you know? -Yeah. -Why? We're family. We have plenty of time. [all chuckle] oh, look, I'm out of popcorn. You know what? I'm going to take a full minute and get more. [laughs] I am so sorry you had to lie to her again. Me, too. -But we're in too deep now. -Yeah. Hey, we're almost across the finish line. Yeah. Then what? I don't know. But first things first, if you still need a date to your Christmas eve party, I'd love to be your plus-one. Camille: You guys, I think this is the one. Please stop saying that. You've literally deemed the last nine dresses that way. Camille: No, this one has pockets. Camille, my lunch break is almost over. Camille: Hey, listen, it is your duty as my maid of honor to stay until I find the dress. Change faster! [sighs] do you think they have a toilet in here? [gasps] I think... This is the one. Yeah? Yeah. It's breathtaking. What's wrong? Are you crying? -Are those happy tears? -Yes. [voice breaking] I'm so happy. I love him so much. But I'm happy because you're finally in love, too. Sawyer? I found your dress. Look. Oh, no, I'm not shopping for dresses yet, mnh-mnh. And thanks to me, you'll never have to, because this is perfect for you. -That is stunning. You guys, today is about Camille, not me. I have obviously found my dress, so try that on. It's so pretty. Just try it on. -Fine. -[laughs] and then I'm going back to work. [ring] [ring] -oh. -[ring] -[chimes] -hi. Whoa! That's close. What's going on? -Nothing. -Nothing? I don't want you to see where I am because I don't want you to get the wrong idea. Oh, well, now you piqued my curiosity, and I must see. -No. -Please? We're here for Camille, and the girls wanted me to try on a dress. It is not what you think. [gasps] I-I...I think you're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen. There's no way that you're this perfect. I demand to know your biggest flaw right this instant. Actually, I have to help Hillary with the nursery. Can I get a dinner raincheck? That's your flaw? Sister first? That's unbelievable. But yes. Raincheck. Uh, you're still planning on meeting me at Dr. Timothy's retirement party tomorrow night? Yes, yes, absolutely. Uh, wear that dress. Camille: Sawyer, will you get out here? The suspense is killing us! Go. Wow them. I'll call you later. All right. Love you... [gasps] ...To call me later. Love you to call me later. [chuckles nervously] bye. [sighs] I cannot believe that I just did that. Hang on. So you just blurted out, "love you"? Kind of, but I covered quickly, so I don't think it was a big deal. How did you cover? Show me. Okay.

[indistinct conversations] welcome, dear friends, and merry Christmas eve to you all. Thank you for joining us tonight to honor my husband, Dr. Bill timothy. Now first of all, I think we can all agree that his greatest accomplishment was convincing me to marry him. [laughter and applause] but not too far behind that is his impressive career. Uh, in his 43 years in obstetrics, he has welcome 12,149 babies into this world... [guests gasp] ...With the most recent, arriving yesterday...twins. And I know how hard it will be for him to leave this behind and enjoy his next phase of life. And especially hard to leave behind is his colleague... Dr. Sawyer ames. Sawyer, stand up, please. Yeah, sawyer! Whoo! [under breath] that's my boss. [applause continues] now a couple of his first babies would like to say a few words, so come on up, Ainsley and billy, named for my bill. [applause] Hillary, are you okay? You're not supposed to be going out. I felt fine. I just had to exchange something at house to home. -It couldn't wait? -While I was at the desk, I overheard someone ask for a copy of sawyer ames' wedding registry. Are you sure it wasn't Sarah ames? Because my cousin's daughter is getting... I'm positive that it was sawyer. I asked them for a copy of it. Dr. Timothy: ...Privilege of announcing who will take over my clinic, and that is a doctor who has a profound love of learning, deep integrity... You're engaged to a Joshua, and you're dating my brother? -Ahh! -Oh, oh, okay. We need you to sit down, okay, and stay calm. I promise there's an explanation, but right now we need you to focus on your breathing and bring your blood pressure down. I am not going to stay calm. I came here to tell my brother that you're a liar and that he deserves better. -I am a liar, but I'm not engaged, okay? You just have to trust me. Like I can trust anything you say. I'm going to be switching doctors first thing tomorrow! Oh! -[gasps] -...Someone I completely trust. [applause] I think my water just broke. I present my successor, Dr. Sawyer ames.

[guests murmuring] Hillary, Hillary, is this happening? -[exhales deeply] -do you need help, sweetie? Uh, thanks, mom. I think we've got it. -Landon? -Yes, I got you. Landon? Why do you keep calling him Landon? Sawyer: Long story! Can't explain now! [door closes] [telephone ringing in distance] [indistinct p.A. Announcement] I'm sorry I ruined your party, guys. This is a way better party. And I'm sorry I accused you of trying to two-time my brother. -That was all my fault. -And my fault. -And a little my fault. -That's true. [chuckles] this last month would have been impossible without all of you. You're a soldier's wife. You do impossible things every day. That's true, too. I'll be right back. You're amazing, sis. He's perfect. I'll give you guys a few minutes. So...People are waiting for you. Okay. [sighs] -I'm not sure what to say. -Just tell them the truth. They love you, and they want you to be happy, and look at you. You're so happy. I am. Now be so brave. Wish me luck. [whispers] luck. [chuckles] sawyer, is the baby okay? He's perfect. That's good news. So I know things got weird when I ran out, and, um, I wanted to explain. You mean why you called Joshua "Landon"? Yes. Well, his sister also called him that. Maybe he goes by his middle name? No, his name is Landon. It's not Joshua. Why can't you call your fiancé by his real name? -Well, Landon is not my fiancé. -But Joshua is? I know this is getting really confusing. -Start at the beginning. -[inhales deeply] I was shopping at house to home, um, feeling sorry for myself that I'm not having all of those happy occasions that warrant a registry, when my friend suggested that it would be cathartic to make one and put on it, you know, all of the things that I could ever possibly want. It was private, and no one was ever meant to see it. But, um, the system glitched. -And we found it. -You found it. And when you all surprised me, I was just too embarrassed to tell the truth. Even to me? Well, mom, I tried, but you had converted your guest room into a baby nursery. So anyway, um... Landon and I were on a date when we ran into my ex, Josh, who just...well, he assumed that Landon was my fiancé that everyone had been talking about. I panicked and said that Landon was Joshua Gotaway. You made a registry with a fake fiancé called Joshua Gotaway. So I begged Landon to go along with it, and then when his sister's baby arrived, he would just go back to his life and dump me, and then... You know, no one would ever know that it was all pretend. -You should've just told us. -We would've understood. Well, I wanted to, and then... Well, I didn't want to because the truth is... I was having the best time that I've had in a really long time. Well, it didn't seem like you were pretending. I mean...You...you fooled me. Well, I didn't have to pretend much because... Landon is a really great guy. He genuinely makes me laugh. He won't let me get away with any of my usual relationship sabotage. He drops everything to care for his sister or for me. I mean, he saves cats. He...he shares his food, and I think... I think I'm in love with him, as crazy as that sounds. Really? -You're in love with him? -You're in love with him. But that doesn't excuse my lying. No, it doesn't. I know you must wonder if you can trust anymore, bill. You're right, and I won't give my clinic to someone I can't trust. Bill. [sighs] Joshua was the biggest mistake of my life. I regret lying, but I don't regret where it led me with Landon. I'm still sorry, and I hope you can forgive me. Well, this is... this is all a little crazy. I mean, it's a lot crazy, and I... I need time to process this. I feel confused and... And even a little tricked. I'm sorry. It's gonna blow over, I promise. Yeah. Someday I'll forgive you. [chuckles] mm. You guys. -[knock on door] -come in. How's the birthday boy doing? He's perfect. He is, and you did so great. Um, Landon, can I talk to you for a sec? Uh, yeah. Hillary, will you be all right? Of course. You two take as long as you want, and Jules is here. Truth be told, I'm having a really hard time not stealing that sweet, sweet baby and running away. What a crazy day, huh? A good crazy for me. How about you? Rough, but, um, everybody knows the truth. What'd you tell them? I told them that it just happened, and, uh, every time I tried to fix it, something made it impossible, and that it was all just a huge mistake. But, um, before I could finish, bill walked out, so, um, everything I was afraid of happening happened, and, uh, it was all for nothing. The good news is we don't have to pretend anymore. Pretend? Right, yeah. Um... No more pretending, so that's a... That's a huge relief. Now that the baby's here and my mom's on her way, I'm going home, so... Good timing. But, Landon... I... Can't thank you enough. Of course. Sorry it didn't work out... For you and your job. That's...My own fault. I guess that, uh, honesty is the best policy. Landon? Goodbye, sawyer. [door closes] [sniffles] and then he said, "well, the good news is we don't have to pretend anymore," and I didn't know what to say, so I just...I left. It was not pretend. I don't know what happened between the party, where I thought he was saying he loved me and the hallway where it felt like he couldn't get away from me fast enough. [crying] you want me to stay tonight? [sniffles] would you? You think Santa will find me here? -Of course. -Then I'll stay. -Really? -Yes. -Okay. -Scootch over. [exhales deeply] ["o come, all ye faithful" playing on stereo] I'm sorry I walked out on you last night. I was hurt and... I just needed my space. I get it. Well, I understand how hard it must have been to tell me about Landon, especially when I took us all down the grandchild road. Yeah, well, Landon didn't help that much. Apparently, tears are his weakness. Remember that. It will come in handy. Landon and I... we're not together now. -What? -I guess we never really were. Well, that's not what it looked like to the rest of us. I mean, what happened? I'm not sure. I was telling Landon how it went, and...All of a sudden he became distant. Well, what did you say to him? Well, I said I told you all it just happened and that it was a huge mistake, and I... wait. You said "mistake" to Landon? -Yeah. -On Christmas eve? Sweetie, those are the exact words... -Oh, no! -...His ex-wife said to him. No, no, no! How could I be so stupid? Well, did you tell Landon he wasn't a mistake? [sighs] no. In fact, I finished by saying I lost my job, so it was all for nothing, because I am a horrible, insensitive, selfish human being. -No, you're not. Little oblivious, but, sweetie, you're not those other things. He deserves to hear the truth. People probably wonder if I'm capable of telling the truth at this point. No, this is not over. You...you just need to, um, carve him a love spoon like the traditions of our welsh ancestors, and then he'll know your true feelings. Aside from the fact that I can't whittle, a love spoon won't fix this. Look, mom, I know you're trying to help, but it's too late. If we were meant to be, it would be. Listen, little miss Doris day, sometimes you have to make "meant to be" happen. It's too late. And if bill doesn't fire me, I'll be so busy trying to prove myself that I won't have time for a relationship anyway. Well, except for ours, I hope. Always. Always for ours, mom. Only, uh, five more days till the healthy eating resolution starts. Time to get my fries on. Lunch? I've got that meeting with bill and bonnie. Oh, that's right. Okay. Good luck. And I'll bring you something back. [knock on door] -hi, bonnie. -Hi, sawyer. Hi, bill. Thank you for meeting with me. Bonnie: Of course. I'm sorry for giving you the cold shoulder these past few days. -I let you down. -Yes, you did. There aren't words for how sorry I am, and I don't take my actions lightly. I feel it's only right to withdraw myself as a candidate for your practice. You deserve someone that you can trust completely. And while I know that's no longer me, I hope it will be again someday. Well, I appreciate the thought you've given the situation. I've been thinking, too, and I know this whole mess is the exception to an otherwise impeccable record. That is very gracious of you. Thank you. I remember the excitement of being newly in love with bonnie. I did some crazy things, too. Oh, the stories I could tell you. [laughter] I think my response the other night was more about my fatherly feelings toward you and feeling hurt that you would lie to me. I get it, and I hope that one day you can forgive me. That day is today. Well, I promise nothing like that will ever happen again, and I would be very grateful if you could assure the new boss of that and maybe encourage them to keep me on. I'm sorry. I can't do that. Bill? What can I do to convince you? I have worked so hard to get here, and I know I made a huge mistake, but... Sawyer, you're a superb doctor who got tangled in an embarrassing lie, but that shouldn't undo all of your years of hard work. Congrats. [applause] this is...This is real? Oh! Thank you! [laughs] so much! [gasps] you deserve this. Thank you, everyone. Back to work. Sweetie! -[gasps] -[laughs] I'm so proud of you. And on top of that, you found a man who knows you're a catch and won't let you go. Landon is no Joshua. Oh, we aren't together anymore. Oh, but you were perfect for each other. Yeah, I guess... He didn't think so. Oh, sawyer, I'm sorry. But the silver lining is I found out you were right, bill. Don't live to work. Work to live. Hard way to learn it, but still a good lesson. Well, I know your daddy would be so proud of you. -[laughs] -thank you, mom. Oh, baby. Okay. How does this sound, tater tot? "dear Landon, it's clear you don't wanna talk to me, but I hope you'll read this just the same. I wanted to clear something up." -[computer chimes] [purrs] [clicks mouse] "Dr. Landon James will be on site to offer complimentary veterinary consults on any adopted pet." you're getting a little brother. ♪♪♪ [dogs yelping] he's a really good boy. We're gonna miss him around here, but these fine people over here, they can help you fill out the paperwork, okay? Good boy. Good boy, you. So he's...he's been answering to "Lincoln." hey, Lincoln. Yeah. [cat meowing] aw. You're a sweetie. I wonder how you would get along with my tater tot. -Sawyer? -[gasps] Landon. What are you doing here? Uh...My clinic works with the rescue. What are you doing here? I'm thinking about getting another cat. Tater tot could use a buddy. Well, most cats do better with partners, so... Good advice. Thanks. [dog barking in distance] well, I guess I'll keep looking for the perfect companion... For tater tot. The perfect companion for tater tot. Tell him I say hi. [barking continues, cat meows] he's a purr factory. [chuckles] yeah. He's such a cutie. He's a bit older. His family moved to a new place that doesn't allow pets, so they dropped him off here. [meowing loudly] excuse me. Black cats and older cats are the last ones people adopt, so this little guy might have a hard time finding someone to love him. He's such a sweetheart. I can't believe someone would let him go. Well, maybe they realized it was a mistake to bring him home in the first place, and they regret it. Well, if that happened, I bet it was a misunderstanding. No. He heard 'em crystal clear. Or maybe they picked the absolute worst words to tell him what had happened, and they didn't realize it. And they didn't get a chance to explain that Joshua was a mistake, but Landon... I really liked him. And then I hurt him, and I am truly sorry for that. And I miss him... Even if he was just pretending. Come on, little buddy. You're coming home with me for a fresh start. I promise I will never leave you, and you'll never be hurt again. [cat meowing, dog barking in distance] look, if you're handing out fresh starts, I'd like one, too. Really? This time, I'll be Landon. And I'll be sawyer. You were sawyer last time. Well, I thought I did a pretty good job. Hi, sawyer. I'm Landon. I'm a vet. Thank you for your service. I'm...I'm just gonna say it. -I love cats. -How many do you have? What number doesn't make you run? I'm not going anywhere. -[cat meows] -oh. You squished churro. [laughs] let's look at you, buddy. Yep. Oh, you're gonna be just fine. Churro? So there's tater tot and churro. What fried food are we gonna name the next one? Wonton? Okay, you have no idea how perfect that is. Oh, okay, but for future reference, I am naming our actual children. Let's go home, churro. Yeah? Come on, buddy.
