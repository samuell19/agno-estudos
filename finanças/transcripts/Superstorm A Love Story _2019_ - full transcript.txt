Hey there, good-looking. Hey. - You ready? - Yeah, I had trouble with my toilet and it's overflowing a bit. That's disgusting. If my boyfriend would let me move in with him, I wouldn't have to worry about stuff like that. - I don't know why you're with the guy. He's such a dick. Don't I know it. Can you grab my stuff? That's it? We're going to your cabin for the weekend. How much clothing do I need? You following me? You catching my drift? I'm following, I'm following. Do you have your phone charger? Check. - Pain meds? - Check. Did you tell your mom we're going? Not yet. Remember what happened last time. I'll give her a call from the car so she doesn't called the police again. - Where's your cat? - He's at my sister's. I can't believe I'm dating a guy who doesn't like cats. Oh, I like cats, just not your cat. But he's the cutest little poopsie pants. He's a little shit. Okay, come on. Let's go. So this is the cabin. What, you don't like it? No, it's nice enough. I just have a bad feeling about this place. What kinda bad feeling? Like I could be murdered at any moment. Oh no. I wouldn't let anyone murder you. But you could be the murderer. Haven't killed anyone in a long time. - Just be aware. I gave everyone I know this address. - Ooh, perfect. If they show up, more victims for me. Ah, I knew it. I knew it. You're gonna kill me. And there's no one that's gonna hear you scream. - My goodness. That's a psychotic gleam in your eyes is kinda turning me on. Ooh, if I knew that, I woulda revealed my evil a long time ago. Stop. You're scaring me. - You got a gun? - A gun? Here. Use this just in case. Great, I'll bludgeon 'em to death with my Peewee football trophy. Oh, hey, Sheriff Watkins. Oh hey there, Jim. Why don't you come on in? This is Amy. Ma'am. Sorry to barge in on you. We're just going around to all the houses in the valley to alert everyone about the pending storm coming in tonight. - Yeah, I heard about it. They said it could get pretty bad. I'd say. They're calling it a possible superstorm. Superstorm? That sounds scary. Some kinda collision between two types of snow storms or something or other. Don't know the particulars, but I just wanted to give a warning. Thank you, Sheriff. I take it you have all the emergency numbers you might need. Yeah, I'm all set with that. Well, I'll let you continue with your evening. Thanks. Sounds like it could be worse than I thought. That's it. We're gonna die. Oh, jump to conclusions much. Let's see. We have enough food, right? Yes, we have enough food and there's even more in the freezer. What about candles? For romantic dinners? In case the lights go out. Even better than that, I have lanterns. And what about heat? Runs on propane. I didn't even see that earlier. Ooh, we're gonna be cuddling in front of that later. - Oh yeah. - What about alcohol? Oh, there's plenty of alcohol. You may be able to take advantage of me. Are you positive about the food rations? Yes, I am positive. There's so much food, we're not gonna have to ration. You can't say that. You don't know how long we're gonna be here. Do you remember those soccer players whose plane crashed? The one in the Andes where they had to eat each other? Exactly. I think we'll be okay. If we don't make it, you think I taste good enough to eat? Oh yeah. It's so mesmerizing. Yeah, you are. More, madam? Silly question. I wish this moment could last forever. I guess we'll just have to come here more often. Oh, you're saying you'll keep me around? Oh, you'll suffice. Hm. I'm just kidding. - Are you kidding? - Uh oh. Do I hear serious Amy coming out? You're right. No, I'm not gonna ruin this wonderful weekend together. Look, we've been together for a year. I'm very happy. I know, but what if one day you get sick of my being youthful and all? Youthful? I've seen what you look like in the morning. That's for me losing sleep because of your snoring. Yeah, yeah. And for the record, I'm not that much older than you. Ooh, honey, I hate to break it to you but you're pretty fucking old. I think I should be offended. I mean gray pubic hair is not a young man's plight. Yeah, now you're taking it a little too far. It's not gray... yet. Just keep watching the fire. Mesmerizing. Yeah. What the hell is that? What the hell are you doing here? I told you I was coming here this weekend. No, you said next weekend. - No, I said this weekend. Don't you have it written down some place. Look, I do so I'm right. Okay, I'm not gonna fight with you about this. Aren't you going to introduce me to your friend unless she needs to get dressed first? - Amy, this is Kate. Kate, Amy. You're so... cute... and perky. Hey, you must be Big Jim. It's Jim, just Jim. Oh, watch it, sweetie. The carpeting can get a little slippery. I have some Barbie band-aids if she has any boo boos. You can just take your stuff and bring it back to the car right now. Ooh, you're joking. There's no room in the inn. Need I remind you I own half this place? Look, Kate, I need you to not be selfish here. It's obviously a bad situation. The situation is that it's already snowing and there's a storm coming. No, they called that off. Didn't you hear. Wait, there's no massive storm coming? Look, there's tons of motels in the area. Why don't you just stay at one of them? - No. - On me. - No, this is my weekend. This is my cabin. If anyone should leave, it should be you and the preschooler. ♪ Who's stuck in a traffic jam ♪ ♪ I got more calls than a beach got sand ♪ ♪ Suck it up, mm, suck it up ♪ ♪ Mm, fill it up my coat ♪ You've been hiding me. I haven't been hiding you. Yes you have. You're protecting me from her. I can see why. She isn't that bad. She just takes some getting used to. Like a rash? The situation probably just caught her off guard. She was being defensive. Yeah. I'll tell you what, if the snow isn't too bad in the morning, we can go home if you want. No. I'm gonna stay and I'm gonna mark my territory. You sounded a little creepy and weird. It kinda makes me think you're gonna pee everywhere. Yeah. I know. - Good night. - Night. Oh, hey, Big Jim. What's up? I didn't realize anyone was in here. Oh, I'll be with you in a sec. I just gotta finish up this really awesome article on elephants. You're being very loud and there's other people in the house. Oh, oh, sorry. Hey, hey, come in here a sec. I gotta ask you a question. Did you know there's two different kinds of elephants out there? An Asian elephant and an African elephant. Two kinds, dude. Does that blow your mind or what? It's very exciting. Dude, this is gonna be an awesome weekend. You're being loud again. Listen to me going on about elephants when the host of the place needs to use the facilities. Dude, I think me and you are gonna become really good friends. I don't think so. Me and Big Jim are gonna be tight. Name is Jim, just Jim. Mm-hm. Well, they sure weren't fooling around about that storm coming overnight. Yup. Looks like we're gonna be here a while. Gives us time to get to know one another better. Ah, making a western omelet. I haven't had one of those in years. I see you're using scallions. - Oh, you don't like them. - No, I love them but Jim despises them. - Oh no, no, no. It's green onions he doesn't like. Hon, green onions and scallions are the same. - What are you talking about? - They're the same thing? Then why are they called different things if they're the same? That's just one of the great mysteries of life. I've made Jim these omelets before and he's never said a word. Maybe he didn't wanna disappoint you. You know how Jim can be a pushover. I mean, he's sweet and compassionate, but I would not call him a pushover. How long have you two been together? About a year? Hm. Well, maybe you're not pushing his buttons hard enough with those little fingers of yours. So, Amy, what do you do? I'm a barista. So you serve coffee from behind a counter. I'm a barista. Yes, of course. But it's just like saying a bike messenger is a courier or a janitor is a custodian. Yet they're perfectly fine occupations... I assume. And what do you do, Kate? Oh, I'm a stock consultant. Oh, congratulations. That sounds like a very important job. Well, as long as we enjoy what we do, that's the most important thing. And I'm still in my 20s and have plenty of time to reach my goals. Yes, but you have to fulfill some of those goals otherwise you're left with a life of childish whims. Oh, mother fucker! Did somebody call me? Hey, I really liked those articles in that magazine last night. Do you have any more reading materials with articles like that? No, but there's this magic little box that you probably have in your pocket where you just type into it whatever you want and hit search and it'll find it for you. You'll have to excuse Miller. He's a little tired this morning. This one's an animal in the sack. Oh, I'm sorry, dude. That was rude. It's all right, dude. What, it's been a couple months for you guys? Give it a little more time. She'll be like roadkill in the sack. There she is. How's the little finger feeling? It's fine. - What happened? - Just a little culinary mishap. Oh, speaking of which I hope you don't mind. I remade the omelets. You... remade the omelets? They didn't have the right texture to them. - That's fine, Kate. You know what, how 'bout you just cook the whole time we're here. - That makes sense. I mean, I know how three of the four of us eat and you can serve the coffee. Jim, let me be up front with you. Coming back from a torn ACL can be a tricky thing. The recovery time can up to nine months and that's just to be able to walk without pain. But it will heal. Yes, but you'll miss a substantial time from playing and to play at the level you've been at might not be a possibility, at least not at your level of play. I don't wanna see you come all the way back just to sit on the bench. Football is all I know. I will get back to where I was. I wish you luck. Thanks, Doc. They laid a foul on. It's his first and the team's first. Morissette at the line. Just shooting one. Hey, baby. Knee's acting up? Yeah. Who's playing? The guys in red versus the guys in blue. I like blue. I'm gonna go with the guys in blue. They're down by two touchdowns. I always like the underdog. It makes it so much more interesting. Yeah? Is that what I am to you? To me, you always take the cake. Oh cake. I'm sorry I made such shitty omelets. Who said you make shitty omelets? The speed at which you were eating Kate's told me so. I was eating your original batch, the ones with the lumpy texture. - Really? - Yeah. I especially liked those green things you put in them. They weren't kidding about it being a superstorm. Yeah, super. Hey, I need you to do me a favor. While we're here, lay off Amy. You mean look at me, aren't I the cutest. That Amy? She can't help it if she's cute. Oh, shut up, Jim. She's not that cute. She's just so... cute. What's the deal with this Miller guy? He's a good guy. So is that his first name or his last? His name is Miller Bayer. His name is Miller Bayer? What were his parents thinking? So what does Miller Bayer do for a living? I'm a waiter. Oh, sounds interesting. Yeah. With a good chance of becoming the new headwaiter. Oh. - Mm-hm. Yeah, it's a lot of responsibility, but I think I can handle it. Yeah. At least you have something to aspire to. Yeah. But really I'm just doing the waiter thing until I can get my big break as an actor. All those crazy times. Do you remember that Christmas party where we met, the one where we smoked all that weed? How could I forget? I was trying my best to impress you and I kept smoking and smoking and trying not to cough. You were failing miserably. What can I say? I was a newbie with a dooby. You sure were. Oh, and you were the pro? We left the party early. We got lost. We drove around for hours and we ended up in Panama City. And we ended up crashing on the beach and... I remember it well. Remember when we woke up, all those crabs were all over us? They were hanging for parts of our body they had no business being. We had to go to the showers and pluck each other for an hour. Everyone always thinks it's just about taking the orders, but there's so much more that goes into it. Like, I gotta remember all the specials. Sometimes they got foreign names and they can get pretty tricky. We had some crazy times in college. Remember that time we went to Bullwinkle's? Or the time that you bet that you could drink me - under the table. - Oh. - Yeah, you lost. That was a bit embarrassing. Embarrassing? You started a barroom brawl. Well, it was my fault for taking the bet. I mean, look at you and look at me. How was I gonna win? You were so plastered that you fell off the bar stool right in front of a wheelchair. I know. I looked up and all I saw are two wheels coming right at my head. Then he swerved around you and hit the waitress and her tray of drinks just flew right across the bar and hit those guys. Oh my gosh. I looked up and all I saw were fists and feet flailing. It was like the Wild West in there. And then you picked me up and you threw me over your shoulder and you took me out. My own personal hero. And the night was still young. But it was still your fault. - Of course it was. It always is. Sometimes when I get back to the table, I forget who ordered what, but instead of giving everyone the wrong food, I want them to think that I'm this super-duper waiter, right? So I just kinda hold up a plate on display and say something like the chicken, blah, blah, blah? Someone always raises their hand and I still look like I know what I'm doing. So as drunk as you were, you still didn't wanna go home. Oh, okay. And you weren't drunk? Tipsy. Tipsy at best. Yeah, okay. So then you were drunk off your ass in the movie theater and you just started yelling at me to get you a giant bucket of popcorn. So like an idiot, I get it for you. And you had the bucket what, five minutes before you give out a big blood curdling scream and just throw the popcorn everywhere? And then you start yelling at me, "I want another bucket. I want another bucket. Get me another bucket of popcorn." And then up until everyone in the theater just started yelling at us. Oh, it was such a mess. And then the manager came and threw us out. Well, it was your fault for taking me to a horror film. That was very scary. A horror film? We saw "My Big Fat Greek Wedding". Well, marriage can be a scary thing. Well, how scary it could have been? I mean, you said "I do". So you have your black coffee and then you have your specialty coffees. And then it gets into all the various flavor bursts, and then if you want your milk steamed or not. And they have like oat milk and almond milk and all these crazy milks. It's this new thing. Yeah, mostly like a Brooklyn thing. But yeah. And then it's like, what kind of cup do you want? Iced or hot? I like iced. So it wasn't just my imagination? Once upon a time we had some fun together. Yeah, we did. Don't mind me. I'm just getting some water. Hey, there's a lot of snow outside. Maybe later on, we go build a snowman. Yeah. And maybe while we're at it, we can build some snow angels too. So what are you kids talking about? Oh, we're just talking about our dreams, the people we wanna become in the future. And who is it you wanna be in the future? Well, mostly I wanna do stage work. I wanna be taken seriously as an actor. So you're an actor. Kate failed to mention that you were an actor. I don't want be an actor. I already am an actor. Miller is a fine waiter at with Le Chateau Dadue with an eye in training to become the manager one day. Remember we talked about that, honey? Yes. But you know what, I don't know how to do the scheduling or be in charge of anyone. Did I say waiter? I meant headwaiter at Le Chateau Dadue. Well, not yet, but hopefully soon. So Miller, what type of acting gigs have you done? Well, let's see. I was recently in a Wellington Bank Commercial. Really? Was it a speaking role? I was speaking, but you couldn't hear me. So you were in the background. Kinda. I was outside of the bank driving by and talking on my phone. But you could definitely see me when I stop at a light. What does something like that pay? Oh, I didn't get paid. I didn't even know they were shooting a commercial till I saw it on TV a few days ago. That's gotta do wonders for your career. Oh, also I've been doing a one-man show for the last few months. Anyone want more wine? Sounds good. So tell me about this one-man show. Uh, Jim, would you like more wine? Sure. Why don't you help me? It's not like there's a wine cellar. It's just right in the kitchen. So anyway, I've been doing a one-man show where I talk about my past and my life as an actor. That sounds interesting. So where could we catch this one-man show? Do you know Schulman's Deli in the city? Yeah, I know it well. Is it in the theater right next door? - Oh no. It's in Schulman's Deli. Yeah, they have a small theater - in the basement. - Oh. In the basement of the deli. Yeah. I do a show the third Thursday of every month.' Oh couldn't get a weekend spot, huh? Son of a bitch! So I've been trying to get that weekend slot, but there's a waiting list and everyone wants it. And it's really tough to get. You must be far down the list. Well, I'm on my way. So Amy, I know you said you have some aspirations. What are they? I plan to go to FIT next year. I wanna be a fashion designer. Oh, I think that is wonderful. And you would be great at designing a line of children's clothing. - Okay, okay. Maybe we should just calm down here. I think you should calm down, Jim. Yeah, you seem edgy. Edgy? I seem edgy? Yeah, you're turning red. I am not edgy. Ladies, ladies, were ruining Big Jim's wine buzz. I'm not buzzed and my name is Jim. Just Jim. Oh! I forgot to tell him I may be playing a tomato in a local car commercial next week. It's a speaking role. What was that all about in there? What? Oh, are you gonna be all pouty wouty now? Maybe. Does little boy need kissy wissies to make him feel better? Get off me. I was standing up for you in there and you teamed up with her and attacked me. I would rather join forces with ISIS. If anything, I was being Switzerland in the situation. Well, I do like your Alps. Let me just say, if anyone was attacking anyone in there, it was you attacking poor Miller about his acting career. - His what? - You cannot fault a guy for following his passion. Honestly, I think you're envious of him. Are you being serious right now? I mean, he's good-looking. - Whatever. - He's younger. I'm still in my 30s. You act like I'm on the top step to the nursing home. And he's with Kate. Oh great. Now you're angry... again. You forgot to include that he's also a moron. And why should that bother you? I don't know. Maybe because I think she should be with someone more established. And that wouldn't bother you even more? You know, maybe you should go into psychiatry instead of fashion. It's okay to share your feelings with me, Jim. I'm not just some hot piece of ass you got here. Maybe it would be easier if you were. Well, too bad. 'Cause I got the bod and the brains to go with it. Look, here's what I know. I was married to Kate for 12 years and I truly want her to find the right person. And Miller Bayer is not that person. I found the right person and I'm deliriously happy. Well, that's all the time we have for today. Our session is over. Ah! Ah. Oh! Ah! Ah! So I hope noise earlier wasn't coming from in here. What noise was that, Jim? Well, I mean, the only reason I'm even saying anything is just 'cause we all have to sit on this couch. So if it was, it would be kinda disgusting. I can assure you that we were in the bedroom as discreet as possible. It didn't sound that way. I'm sorry, dude. We didn't mean to disturb you. This one just gets out of control. I know what you mean. Amy here is like an Olympic gymnast, great at the mounting and sticking the landing. What? Okay, I think those pain meds are getting to you. Come on. Don't be shy in front of our guests, babe. Come here. Do you know what I love about Kate? She's all business at work during the week, setting those guys straight, putting them in their place. And then she comes home and does the same thing to me. I remember when we were on a fishing trip and just went and made love on the docks. The only thing I remember about that trip is stepping on a nail on the dock and having to go to the emergency room to get a tetanus shot. What about the time that we made love in the corner of the mattress store? Mm, yeah. You fell asleep in the corner of the mattress store. Maybe you dreamt the rest. Well, last month we were at the amusement park and- - No, don't, stop. Don't tell that story. - Oh, come on. - It's private. - We're all, We're all friends here. So anyway, the Ferris wheel gets stuck and we're way at the top and I start freaking out. And the next thing I know my pants are around my ankles and well, I'm getting a little bit- Okay, okay, we get the rest. Thank you. I'm just gonna say we may have been stuck, but we were the only car rocking. Woo hoo! Okay, okay, calm down now. Well, that reminds me of the hiking trip that we went on. It started raining so we just ran from the trail and went under the ledge of the rocks and, well, we spent the next few hours being very romantic. You remember that. Honestly, you lost me at gymnast. I don't know where these stories are coming from. Yeah, that last story was with me, not Amy. It what? - The hiking story? That was when we went to Washington. Oh shit. I think you're right. Wow, this has been really fun. I got an idea. Let's play a game. I told you it doesn't matter how hard you press with the marker. I still don't know what it is. Come on. Don't just sit there, say something. - A farmer? - What? No, does that really look like a farmer to you? I don't know, a fireman, a cop? What? Two firemen, two cops? No! Um, a cockatoo? What? Time's up? - Oh, come on. No, that was not a minute. That was a very quick minute. It actually ran out a long time ago. I just let it go over because you guys are so bad at this, I didn't want it to stop. Oh! You guys are cheating. I don't know how yet, but I'm gonna figure it out soon enough. Amy darling, how do you plan to go to fashion school when you draw like a far-sighted two-year-old with alcohol withdrawal tremors? I don't know. I'll hire someone for that. I don't know how the answer is not a cockatoo. - Thank you, Miller. - I mean, the resemblance is remarkable. How is this a cockatoo? There are clearly arms and legs here. - Oh. Then what kinda bird is it? It's not a fucking bird. Is it Don King? Don who? Don King. He's a... You know what, forget about it. Are these two people related? Well, in a way yes. Are they George and Barbara Bush? - George and Barbara Bush? What? George, Jr. And his wife. What is wrong with you people? No. These on the top of this guy's head are feathers. So that would make him a... A transvestite? A guy dressed up as a cockatoo. A Native American. This is a Native American. Feathers on his head. So that would make him a what? Uh... Not a cowboy. Look, see, there's a buckle on the hat. Oh, it's the buckle is throwing me off. I mean, we have buckles on our belts. Maybe some shoes have buckles but a hat? It's a Pilgrim. It's a fucking Pilgrim. Do you see there's the guy with a buckle on his hat and a fucking... Are you guys, are you aware of Thanksgiving? You know, it's actually not a bad drawing now that we know what it is. - Thank you. - But I think if you drew a turkey, that would help. You know what my favorite part of Thanksgiving? The cranberry sauce. - Yeah. - Mm. - And the stuffing. Oh yeah, but that'd be hard to draw though. You guys are ridiculous. I think it's a perfect drawing. If I wasn't drinking, I would've gotten it immediately. Okay, our turn. If we win this, it's the best out of five. Mm, but it's not my turn to draw again though is it? - 'Cause I hate... It is. - The drawing part of this game. It's okay. Just concentrate. Oh shit! How am I gonna draw that? 'Cause how the hell am I gonna draw a password? Uh, shit, I said the word. Wait a minute. The the answer is password? Like the password is password. Holy shit, that's funny. The password is password. I'm not following. You know, like the game show "Password". The password is password. Ah, I feel like I'm playing a game with my dead grandparents. Wait, no, no, no, no, no. You can't take another. You can't take a second card. You have to at least lose a turn. What? Just let him take the card. They're so gonna lose this thing already. This one's a good one. - All right. Ready, set, no. Okay. A pizza. Pepperoni. Um, sausages? Meat balls? Um, um, anchovies. That's it! - Yeah. - Yes! Here we go. - Hey, no. They got anchovies and I got Pilgrim? What bullshit. Hey, we got best three out of five. We won fair and square. No. Next time, it's me and Kate on the account of my partner's blindness because I was clearly drawing a Pilgrim. It is not my fault that you draw like a caveman. Touche. Touch me. What do you wanna be when you grow up? When I grow up, I wanna be a garbage man so that I can take all the neighbor's trash cans on one block and switch them with the neighbor's trash cans on the other block, just to fuck with them. When I grow up, I wanna be a jackhammerist. Wait, what's that? What is what? The jackhammerist? It's the guy who holds the jackhammer, duh. Duh. Anyway, when I grow up, I wanna be a jackhammerist so I can shout dirty things to all of the sweet bun fellows that walk by. I like that. Yes. Yeah. When I grow up, I want to be the person who makes the announcements on the trains and mumble so people don't understand what I'm saying. And then they get all scared that they missed their stops or worse, they got on the wrong trains. That is truly fucked up. You're all so cynical. Boo. Tell us, dude, what do you wanna be when you grow up? When I grow up, I wanna be a florist so I could stand outside, see every person that passes by my store and say here's a rose because you are as beautiful as this rose inside and out. Have a wonderful day. That is the most disturbing thing I have heard all week. That was beautiful, dude. It's funny how in most situations just about every person is more tolerable when you're drunk. I know, it's like getting root canal tomorrow. Have a drink. About to meet your daughter's ex-con boyfriend. Have a drink. About to be audited by the IRS. Have a drink. Having a breast enlargement because you're self conscious about your boob size. Have a drink. What? No, that was kinda weird. Yeah, very. I love you Katie bear. No, this part is not so tolerable. Sweet dreams. Where are you going? Are you serious? Come on, Ted. We've been doing this for a long time. There's gotta be some good news out there. You have to have something in the works. I'm trying, Jim, I really am. But since your injury, you lost a few steps. Tell me something I don't know. I know it, you know it, the whole league knows it. All the other teams, I mean, somebody's gotta be looking for an offensive tackle. I will work out for each and every single one of them just to show them what I can still do. You just got cut from Pittsburgh, okay? It's new. Let me get you with a trainer, we'll rehab the knee. You come back stronger next year. - No, no! If we don't get something going soon, they're gonna forget my name. Call, call around the league. Call the CFL. I mean, hell, if you can't find anything, call the Arena League. Somebody's gotta be looking for someone. Is that what you want? You wanna take a step back rather than, what, go out on top? I want to play. I just want to play. All right, Jim. We'll be in touch. What the hell are you doing? Good morning. Not yet it's not. Kate told me about your football days. It was one of the first conversations we had on our first date. Oh, that must have been exciting being on a date and then she's talking about her ex-husband. She spoke proudly of you. She lit up every time she said your name. I went home that night and looked you up. I don't really follow football. You were awesome, dude. Fast and stronger than anyone else on the field. I was pretty good. Don't be modest. I bet you were a god to a lot of little kids out there. I had some fans. You played for a long time. That's not easy. Eight years at Pittsburgh, three years in Canada in the Arena League. Wow. So lucky to have played your heart out for all those years. All I wanna do is win. You were a winner. You still are. Okay. Now this is getting very weird and you're making me uncomfortable because they're gazing at me and you're touching me. Oh, I'm sorry. I get that way around greatness. It's amazing what you did. Thanks. Do you miss it? Every day. I would take a selfie with you, but it's probably not the right place. It definitely is not. Now, can you get out of my bed? Yeah. See you later, buddy. We are not buddies! It's really coming down out there. Yeah, windy too. They say it's supposed to end later today, but I doubt we're getting out by tomorrow. It'd better if we had cell service. I know. We rely on them so much these days. You probably don't remember not having a cell phone. Yeah, I came out of the womb with one with a pre-loaded Barbie app. Hm, I figured. What about MTV? Do you remember when they actually played music videos? Music videos? What are music videos? Let me ask you a question. Do you know how to upload a video to YouTube? Mm-mm. Lots of nonsense on there. That means no. How old are you? You should eat your food before it gets cold. It looks really good. Good idea to have you do all the cooking. It's all in the seasoning. Anyway, it's good hangover food. Mm-hm, yeah. Good times last night. Hm. I usually don't let myself get out of control around strangers. It's okay. I have it all on my phone. We should have taped Jim. I haven't seen a smile that big on his face in eons. Really? He's a fun guy. Jim is fun? Our Jim is fun? - Yeah. We laugh all the time. I think the last time I saw Jim smile that big was when he recovered a fumble and ran it 43 yards for a touchdown. And that was late 2000s. Yeah, that musta been a really great time for him. - Don't get me wrong. It wasn't always a fairy tale. Obviously. You haven't seen all the sides of him yet. I love him. I could accept all of him. - That's sweet. But you know how guys keep their walls up. We're not playing high school mind games with each other. Hon, you're a year in. I've had 12. Believe me when I tell you that things aren't always as they seem. I don't really foresee any death traps lurking around the corner. I'm on the same team as you, Amy. Us ladies need to stick together even if you are from a younger generation. Me and Jim are fine. It's like buying a used car and you're lucky enough to know the previous owner. I know how to bang the engine here to get it started, how to touch it lightly there when stopping at a red light. I know how to hit the gas hard and when to ease up on the brake. The owner's manual is mine now. I think I can figure it out. Well, if you need to talk, you know where to find me. Oh, there's breakfast for you there. I gotta study my lines for that audition this week. Is that for the role where you have a split personality and the other personality as a 10-year-old boy? Nah, I didn't get that one. Oh, I'm surprised. You were perfect for that role. Oh, do you wanna run lines with me? Ooh, sorry hon, I have things to do today. - All right. You ready? I'm just gonna jump in. I'm ready. Hey, what's a tough guy like you doing in the ladies room? To tell you the truth, sweetheart, I'm not here to powder my nose. Well, you better start yapping or I'm liable to scream. I saw you sitting with that dopey-looking excuse for a date in there and thought that maybe you could use my help. Help with what? With teaching you a thing or two about love. You got me figured wrong, fella. I give the lessons and I give 'em hard, like a ruler across the knuckles from a nun so big her name is Sister Sasquatch. I oughta knock the sass right outta ya. But instead I think I'll put that lip to some good use. Oh, my. Take me to the infirmary. I've lost all the feeling in my legs. What do you say we get outta this dump and hope a train to Naughtyville. Two tickets coming right up. The express kind. Was pretty good, right? Yeah. It's typed really nicely. No typos. Oh, you think I got a chance of getting the part? Um... I know what you're saying. I got too much talent to be in a student film. You know what you do have? Confidence. And that will take you a long way. Well, I have been studying the craft for five years. The confidence just came along with it. Five years. Wow. Um... yeah, maybe we should just do it again. I think I got it. But we could do it again for fun. Yes, make sure your backs are straight. Yes. Only a few more. Are we breathing? I said are we breathing? - Yes. - That's it. Good, yes, all right. Yes, dig in there. Dig in. Hey, hey, no, where do you think you're going? - Come on, join us. - I'm just gonna get some coffee. How much longer? My organs are starting to hurt. All right, you gotta keep moving until you hit a wall. And then once the pain passes, you will feel a euphoria enveloping you. - I'm scared. - Woo! Don't worry, Mama's got you. Hey, no, no, no. Get up. Come on, join us. - Can't. You're not a legally certified trainer. You gotta get rid of all the evil toxins in your body. Oh, I'm on good terms with my evils and my toxins. - Ooh, ouch! - Ooh, uh. Ah! Oh! Oh, my ankle. You okay? Oh, my ankle. - I think it's broken. - If you'll get some ice. Just looks like a sprain. Believe me, I've seen many of those in my day. Thank You, hon. How's that feel? That's okay. Thank you, Jimmy. Of course. You know what this reminds me of? That one time when you injured your back and we stayed on the couch together for a week. - Remember that? - What would I have done without you? Remember all those massages I gave you? Oh, do I. Except they always ended up turning into something else. Mm. What can I say? I have magic hands. Where was the spot? Was it here? Yeah. Yeah, that was the spot. Yeah, that injury happened a long time ago, right, Jim? Yeah, yeah, you're right, it did. Jim, would you mind giving my calf a massage? It feels like it's cramped being in one place for so long. - Right there? - Mm, yeah. That's the spot. Mm, yes, oh, it feels so good. Yeah, yeah. A little higher. Mm, yes. Mm, yeah. A little higher. Yes. Oh, it feels so good, mm. You were so brave. A woman was chasing after a stroller down a ramp. - Remember? - Yeah. - She couldn't catch it because of her heels. And then you came out of nowhere, ran down the ramp, lifted the stroller up like Superman, and you saved the woman and her baby. This was I had to do. You were always my hero. That is an amazing story. Jim, can you come here for a sec? You got a light? What? Why are you smoking? Why don't you sit down and take a load off, big boy? Do you need help with something? Funny you should ask. Funny? Why is it funny? And why are you acting so weird? I thought you like it weird. How does that feel? Feels good. It's not making any sense tonight. How does it sound if later I cook you some roast beef? Succulent. What was that for? What, am I not good enough for you? What? - What are you talking about? - Am I not woman enough for you? What's going on? You're gonna fuck me and you're gonna fuck me good. That's what's going on. Come on. Okay. Grab it harder, like you own it! What about these? Are these good enough for you? Uh huh. Are you sure? Oh, I'm sure. You don't sound like you're sure. - Oh, I'm positive. - Prove it to me. Now pick me up and carry me to the bedroom. - What? - Don't fight me. Now, do it. Least to have service. Uh, yeah. I know, it's getting so frustrating. I don't know why it's happening. There's still no service. I'm sure it'll come come back as soon as the snow stops. Your mom's probably planning your funeral by now. Ah, the worrying will do her good. Keep her on her toes. She never liked me much. That's not true. Oh, come on. Every time I walked in the room, she'd do that cute thing where she would say, "It smells like something's rotten, like something has died in the wall." I always thought it was so funny when she did that, You should go visit her for lunch. I'm sure she'd enjoy it. Uh, I'm afraid that she'd poison me. Well, the two of you were really close at one point. Hm. How does she like Amy? They get along really well. I figured she would. She's so eager. Eager to please everyone. I thought the two of you were getting along. Only because it's important to you for some reason. She's a part of my life. Yeah, for now. You never had an issue with the other women I dated. Well, that's because they were all attempts at replacing me, all attempts for things to appear as though they were status quo. And what's Amy? I think she's a Girl Scout who recently grew out of her miniskirt and she needs someone to save her from the big cruel world and you are more than thrilled to be the oversized ape, banging on your chest, showing off to all the other apes in the jungle. Ah, that's tight. Is it so wrong to wanna be with someone who cares about me, someone who makes me feel special? You're not yourself with her. No, Kate, I wasn't myself with you. How can you say that? We were married for 12 years. Yeah, when we were in college, things were great. When I got drafted by Pittsburgh, things were even better. But when my career was over, we were over. You were miserable. Jim. All I ever knew was football. Waking up every day and training ever since I was a little kid, Then I had football and I had you. I had to adjust to being some, just regular married guy. Regular married guy? You make it sound so awful. All I'm saying is that I had to give up something that was such a part of me. Yeah, but you gave me up in the meantime. You didn't give me a chance to find myself, find a version of me that we both could've lived with. I gave you more than enough time. A year, Kate. You gave me a year. And it was the hardest year of my life. It was an adjustment for me as well. But it shouldn't have been about you. I gave you everything for all those years and when I needed you the most, you weren't there for me. You didn't give me time to find myself. It was like a little more of you died each day. And I saw how it was killing you inside and I couldn't do anything to help you. And I knew that if I stayed, I would die with you. Well, we're both still here. Well, I don't have to ask who made the roast beef. What's wrong with the roast beef, Kate? Doesn't taste like roast beef. Tell me what it tastes like. Like a burnt hockey puck. I think it's succulent. I agree. You don't even know what succulent means. And what is this supposed to be? Oh, that's called broccoli. Well, it tastes like wadded up toilet paper, used toilet paper. Do you eat a lot of use toilet paper, Kate? And they're called mashed potatoes because they're supposed to be mashed. It feels like there's volleyballs in here. Well maybe if Your Highness didn't fall off her pedestal with a boom, she could've made dinner herself. I can hardly walk on this ankle. I think you're faking it for attention. It actually didn't look that bad. You're gonna take her side on this? I'm not taking anyone's side. I'm just saying, I don't think it looked that bad. Didn't look that bad? Didn't look that bad? Is this proof enough? It could be broken for all I know. Is this proof enough for you? Look at me. I'm hobbled. My foot is split in two. That's pretty good. You should take up acting. - Oh, that's enough out of both of you. Just sit down and eat. About the acting thing, Miller. You're not very good. Yeah, right. My acting teachers tell me how good I am. That's because you pay them to say that. If they didn't say that, you'd find a new acting teacher. Well, then why do I get all these auditions? Do you get any callbacks? It's a tough business. You're very good-looking but what you do can't be deemed as acting. You deliver all of your lines in a slow monotone fashion like Stephen Hawking. So he delivers them like he's dead. Could you tell her how good you thought I was this morning? I mean, like you said, it's a tough business, but you still have that restaurant manager option - on the table. - Yeah, but, I don't know how to be in charge of people. You'll learn. I'm afraid of the cooks. What? I'm afraid of the cooks. I have a fear of the cooks. I don't know what they would do to me if I yelled at them. God, I can't eat any more of this shit. - I don't mean to be rude. - No, of course you don't. If you don't mind, I'm gonna go to the fridge and get the leftovers that I made. I don't mind if you choke on them. Excuse me. Oh, I said, I don't mind if you choke on them. You think you're so wonderful, don't you? I think she is. I do too. It sounds like the plows are coming through. I never thought a plow would give me so much pleasure. That came out wrong. I'm kinda bummed though. I wanted to spend more time here with you guys. I like you guys. Oh, Miller. We like you too. I don't like you. Mm. I just want everyone to know that I take back the things that I said earlier. It was harsh and I apologize. Let's just chalk it up too it was a bunch of cabin fever. So my cooking isn't that bad? Your textures are off and your seasonings are iffy, but otherwise... And did you mean what you said about my acting? It's a tough business. Eureka! Oh, just a bunch of text messages about work. And a bunch of messages from Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom. I got a callback. I got a call back for a film, a real film. Was it a silent film? Congratulations. I knew you could do it. How much does it pay? Well, it's not a paid role. Oh, oh, hey dude. I was trying not to make too much noise. - You want some? - Get up! I sense that you're angry about something. Are, are we not buddies anymore? We never were and never will be. What did, what did I do wrong? I don't understand. Is this because I'm dating Kate 'cause I would dump her in a second to be friends with you, man. Let's go, you piece of garbage. Oh wait, but I, I'd do anything to make this right though. I really would. Whoa, what's going on here. I'll tell you what's going on. This loser boyfriend of yours was doing lines - in the bathtub. - Ah, it's not true. I was just smelling it. I like the way it smells. Did you know about this? No, of course not. You know my rule of no drugs under my roof. Not even weed, dude? You were smoking weed while you were here? I can remember. I've been so hopped up all weekend. How could you let this low life in my house? I didn't know. I knew I didn't like him from the first minute I laid my eyes on him. You didn't like him, be honest, Jim, because I was dating him. No, I didn't like him 'cause he's not good enough for you. Oh, okay, so what am I supposed to do? Spend the rest of my life alone. You spend your days with all these professional, distinguished men and you went to the lowest, darkest, dirtiest places to find this guy. I can hear you. I'm standing right here. Shut up! It was just one of those things, okay? We ran into each other a few times. We had some things in common. We started dating. Bullshit. You have nothing in common with him. Hey, he's a good guy. He's simple. He doesn't have any skillset. I was trying to help him out. Help him out? You mean, help him out with what? What is it? I know you're not even with him for the sex. I mean the moans didn't last that long. What? I'm trying to figure out why you're even with him. Look, Jim, there's nothing to figure out. I understand you want me to be happy, but I'm a big girl, okay? I can figure things out on my own. None of this would've ever happened if you didn't just give up on us and run away. I didn't run away. I stayed waiting for you to come home. You stayed for a year. I was scared, okay? I was scared of what would happen if I stayed. Yeah, I believe that you were scared, but what you were scared of was that the money wasn't coming in anymore. I can't believe you just said that. Why, why? 'Cause it's true? No, I was never in it for the money. I loved you for who you were. I loved you long before your career started. I loved everything about you. And then when you retired, it was like you were gone. Yeah, well I'm still the same person. Yeah, you are now, but you weren't then. I thought you were dead. I'm more alive than I've ever been. Fuck! What am I doing? Fuck. What are you doing? Figure the roads will be clear enough, we can head out first thing in the morning. Is everything okay? I heard what you two were talking about when you were arguing. I can't compete with Kate. I'm tired of fooling myself into thinking that I can. She's beautiful. She's a great cook. And you guys have had an entire lifetime together and me... I'm just a blip. You're not just a blip, Amy. You mean everything to me. I just wanna go to bed. I'm really tired. We will head out in the morning, okay? So is everything okay now? No, you idiot! Everything is not, okay? And in case you haven't figured it out, you and I are done. What about Big Jim? Do you think he'll still be my friend? No, Miller? He's not your friend. Just go sleep on the couch. Well, cars are dug out, driveway's cleared enough. Roads are plowed. That was quick. Jim, we need to talk. Look, I know this weekend got out of hand. I'm sorry. Don't apologize. I get it. But there are still some unresolved feelings between you and Kate. I wanna be with you. I'm not so sure. Are you breaking up with me? No, I'm not. I'm just not willing to play second choice. When you figure it out, let me know. Amy. This is nice. Yeah, it's definitely better than us fighting all the time. Our old spot, our little table in the corner. See if the menu's the same. Hey, it might be our old spot, but it's not the old pricing. So have you heard from Amy? Well, no. Um, aren't you Jim Chapel? Yeah. I'm a huge fan. Pittsburgh wasn't the same after you left. - Thanks. - Can I take a selfie with you? Yeah, yeah, of course. Whoa. Oh man, that's great. Wait till my friends see this. Thank you. Could've taken our order while he was here. So what are you going to order? I think I'm going to get- - Let me guess, Chicken Marsala? Well, if you know what you like, why change it? But you know what you like. I'm not still following. When we think of us together, we think of us from the old days. We think of us when we were shiny and new. I tarnished us when I moved. And I will never forgive myself for not staying and trying to work things out. And worse than that, you'll never forgive me, I know. What are you trying to say? You're like my best friend, Jim, and I want you to be happy. You're a part of me and I want you to be happy too. I need you to do something else. What is it? Go get Amy. That silly little 12-year-old girl loves you with everything she's got. She can't cook to save her life, but she sure does know something about love and she makes you happy. Well, what about dinner? Why are you still here and not running to her? Now, where is that waiter? Listen, Jim, the season's already begun and I'm not getting calls for you. I mean nothing from the Arena League, the CFL, or the bigs. You've had a special career. It's nothing to be ashamed about. I just can't accept that it's over. Who the hell wants to be playing football their whole lives? It's all I know. Look, you left it all out there on the field. Everyone knows it and everyone admires it. Promise, Ted, if anyone calls, let me know. Jim. There's not gonna be any more calls. - Hey. - Hi. I was an idiot. I'm sorry. There's no one in this world that I'd rather be with than you. You're my everything. I want you to move in with me. I want you to be the last thing I see at night and the first thing I see in the morning. Stop. You had me at you were an idiot.
