The head of the KGB asks an officer: - How many Jews do we have in our Soviet Union? - Between 6 and 8 million. - And how many would leave if we opened the borders? Between 20 and 25 million. (Russian joke) Carole, I'm sorry. Shit, where were you? I've been here half an hour. Really? Thanks. Here, I got you this. Wait, I'll go. Hello. Polish? No, French. You speak Russian? Luggage. You have any anti-Soviet writing? Books, banned magazines? Pornography, drugs? What's this? Well? Now we're all here, good evening and welcome to Odessa. My name is Pierre, Pierre Dutkin. I'm your Trans Tours rep. Sorry about the wait, but as I was going to say to our unfortunate latecomer, here, it's best to take the little bureaucratic hassles like the Soviets themselves - with a smile. That's my philosophy anyway. May I say something? Because I've been watching you and... How can I put it? It's a real joy to see you. I'm a Russian teacher and there aren't many students like you who would spend their vacation in the USSR. It was his idea. We wanted an original trip for our engagement. Congratulations! Shall we dance? Not dancing? No, not now. The wine, please. How old are you? How old are you? 19. My name's Carole. I'm Léon. Léon the moron. I'm 15. So tell me, what happened? They mainly asked about you. They know it all, that we're cousins... - But how? - They know all about you. They even know you failed Sciences Po. Shit! Are you serious? You think Brickerman and Berkowicz go unnoticed? Fuck, it can't be true. No, it's not true. You asshole! You're such a jerk! What's up? Get a move on. Shall we get started tonight? Microphone Smile. Relax, we made it. The Great Patriotic War was the most terrible and cruelest in our country's history. Léon! Come on! Let's move on. Wait, I want to ask you a favor. Could you buy me some vodka at the hotel shop? No. Why not? Cos I can't. I tried this morning, they said no. Too bad, I can't do it. 4 hours' flight for this crap? You gotta be kidding. Why did you pick such a lame trip for your engagement? I don't fucking get it... People can see right through us. You want a divorce already? We came here to see refuseniks, not hang about in a hotel. Don't shout. Are there mics in the street too? You're totally paranoid. Why come if you don't want to see anyone? Cos you need an interpreter, and also... a bodyguard. The meeting place is here. We're skipping the concert. We're going for a romantic walk. No, it's not here. Nathan Brailovsky? Shoes, please. Anoushka, they're here already. I've got a headache, leave me be. Come and see, they're so young. They were confiscated at customs. Customs? I'm sorry. No, it'll be exactly the same thing. I'd even bet that it'll be worse. How about a little smile, Anoushka? Come on! Why should I smile? Make an effort. You're a jerk. You could have said something. What d'you expect? For me to say: "Israel's really cool!" "There's the sea, the palms, and OK," "there's a few irate Palestinians" "but apart from that, it's heaven!" Nice pajamas. It's funny sharing the same bed, like kids. Remember when we slept in the refuge? On the Italian border, with our folks. Your feet stank so we hardly slept. Your feet stank, you filthy pig! I've washed, you stink. My feet don't smell, see? Smells good, huh? They smell so nice. You don't have to take advantage cos we're engaged. We don't have to have kids, either. How did you two meet? He helped me do my entry exam for Sciences Po. - You went to Sciences Po? - No, he did. Mr Dutkin, did you try the coffee this morning? There were tealeaves floating in it, it was quite vile. What did you do last night? We went for a walk. Be careful, all the same. The freedom to opt out of evening activities is considered an indulgence, nothing more. One... So a two. Five... So six. Let me, I learned the numbers by heart. It's ringing. Is that Viktor Rybak? Understood. It's like a ghost town. I have to tell you something. I've been thinking for a while, since we've been here, I thought... maybe I could write an article. Well... a sort of, I don't know, travel diary. With accounts, impressions, some photos, that kind of thing. Think it's a good idea? You could read it, tell me what you think, if you think it's publishable. Or not, I dunno, what d'you think? May I sit down? Is it safe to speak? - Are we bugged? - Bugged? Yes, maybe. So what? If you're scared, you should go home right away. I'm sorry. Don't apologize. You're not sorry. I'm not sorry. - Understood? - Understood. Here's the physics book and the medicine. The chocolate is from us. Thank you. Rivka, here... Ashkelon. Who? Rivka, wife. And also Ivan, our son. They're in Ashkelon? For how long? 10 years. 10 years, me, visa refused. I was in Israel last summer, I could tell you about it. Ashkelon, for example, is a port. It's a seaside resort, between the desert and the sea. It's a very lively town. It's a land of great contrasts. They talk politics all the time. Everyone does, even people who don't know each other. Love goes away Like this flowing water Love goes away How slow life is And how violent hope is Let the night fall let the hours pass The days go by And I remain. That's beautiful. Who's that by? Apollinaire. Apollinaire, well done. Here, you won. He can't, he's allergic. What? I'm allergic. To chocolate? - Does that exist? - Yes. I was a physicist before my emigration request. They let my wife and son leave. Science was over. He asked for a visa and lost his job. - A letter? - For Rivka. Photo. Are you allergic to vodka, too? How come you speak Russian like that? I learned it in high school. And with my grandpa, a joker like you. A comic like you... He was born in Lvov. He came to Paris in the 1920s. - He wasn't a Communist? - No. He was far too pessimistic. You know nothing about it. I used to be a Communist, too. They must know that you're here. Are you serious? Of course not. Can I use the bathroom, please? Listen, I'd like you to keep this for me. - Me? - Yes, you. Just for a short while. We were told not to accept Russian documents. You see, if we get caught, we could go to jail. Well try not to get caught, then. I'm counting on you. Sovietism is like all totalitarianism: it's dumb. It's dumb rather than monstrous. What did he say to you? Shit, I forgot my jacket. Don't run. Wait! Let's split. Move it up, old man! Come on, move! What's that? Let's go. Thank you. - Listen, Jérôme... - I know, forget it. The folk evening was a great success, despite your absence. - Shall we dance? - No, I'm tired. May I? Hey. I've had a great night. What did you get up to? Nothing special. Hello, Mr Berkowicz? It's the KGB, we'd like to ask you a few questions. Mr Berkowicz? Can you hear me? See you soon, then. See you soon. Open the door, Mr Berkowicz! I really had you going! Can I come in? We need to talk. Don't bother answering the door then! It's my party, isn't it? I took lots of photos. Open up, you chicken-shit yids! Come on! Anton! You're nuts! Fetch your glasses! They're here, fill them up! Adieu. To your visa, Lazar. Good luck. Cheers! Your pranks aren't funny. I know. Did you know Viktor was arrested last night? Did they find anything? Nobody knows. That guy there's Jérôme. - We're not leaving cos you feel ill. - We are. You go ahead, I'll come back later. Bravo! Very nice, great. David Amsallem, from Paris. Hi, Jérôme Berkowicz, from Paris. Hi. When did you arrive? Three days ago. How's it going? You got Hebrew books for Vera? And some pens. I heard you got pics of Viktor's arrest. Vera just told me. Know how risky that is? What would happen if you were arrested? Well I wasn't arrested. Give me your cigarette, come on! Don't worry. We'll renew your visa request. You'll get out eventually. One day we'll all be in Israel. You're dreaming. In France, antisemitism is on the rise again. Assimilation isn't working, many Jews now realize. That's a bit strong. You think antisemitism is on the rise in France? Sadly, that's the truth. I call that propaganda. It's the martyr syndrome: if you're not persecuted, you're not a Jew. Is that it? I'm sorry but, why are you here if that's true? See these youngsters? Vera gives them Hebrew classes, because Hebrew is banned here. They always come wearing 3 sweaters, you know why? They're dressed for the camps. Then why d'you send idiots like me on these trips? I'll tell you. They take anyone to talk to refuseniks about Israel. Want to know why? Israel is just for the visa. They're all aiming for America. That's strategic thinking. Help me out here, please. He doesn't speak a word of English. It's mild this year. It's nice. Do you come often? Almost every year, for... for nearly 10 years. And what do you do? I help those who want to leave. I find family ties abroad. If there are none, I fabricate some. It's the only way out. That, or marriage. I have a Russian wife. Pity, I'll have to divorce to marry you. Tell me straight, what are you saying about me? That you're a patriot! Perfect. What are you doing in the dark? You OK? It's late, but no-one saw me. I've got loads to tell. We went to Viktor's place, with Anton and David, to look for something. A notebook that Viktor wrote. We searched all over. The KGB must have found it. I hope you took photos. Is this for your article? That's great, the Jewish Tribune will want it. What do you think? That you can save the world? You know why we were sent here? No, you know I'm totally dumb. I'll tell you. We're being totally manipulated, we're pawns. I'm quitting, Carole. I've no business being here. - Count me out. - You're not serious? Don't you feel ashamed? We've come here to help people get out. I don't need to come here to know the world's vile. I don't pretend to help people by talking about my holidays. This is all because of Anton... It'll pass. In 3 days we're back in Paris, it'll be forgotten. You're like a brother to me. Thanks very much. Sir? Berkowicz, I'll meet you here in 1 hour. I'm a friend of Viktor's. Thank you. Shit! Look what I got in the hotel shop. I'm going out alone. Where are you going? I need some air. Red? Black dress? Black dress? Red dress. You decided on black in the end. Hello. Don't you recognize me? OK, let's start again. It's a bit frantic. We perform tomorrow, it's the last rehearsal. Put your nose on. So, what's new? What the hell are you...? They let you go? So soon? They're twitchy at the moment. They're arresting everyone. What's the matter? You don't look so good. Me? No, I'm fine. Did you read it? It didn't interest you? You didn't ask me to read it. Do you need my permission? Bring it back to me before you leave, understood? What's wrong with you? Me? You're bleeding. - Viktor's your uncle? - Yes. I didn't know. Seems like he really likes you. Come on, sit down. So, are you on your own? Carole's pretty. Did she do that to you? Take your shirt off. Come on, take your shirt off. I'll find you another. It's sweet. Mosquitoes must love you. Mind the step. Come on, don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. You're handsome. What about Carole? What? Do you love her? Are you crazy? She's my cousin. So what? We're all kinda cousins, aren't we? Exactly, it's time to open up the gene pool. What do you think of all those Jews who live in the same country? Would you go and live in Israel? Me? No. Too many mosquitoes. You're mocking me. I'm not. You don't know anything about it. I'm dying a slow death here. I'm dying and you don't give a damn. Marry me. Get me out of here. Wait, wait. There's someone down there. That's weird. He's looking up at us. Oh fuck! Why are you chasing me? What are you doing here? I was waiting for you. You think it's fun, fucking with me? Take it easy. Get lost! Go on back. But I don't know my way back. Besides, I'm broke. You meet people every night, right? Who are you working for? The Americans? How long you been spying on us? I'm not spying on you. What exactly do you want? I've got no friends and I'm bored. Join the club. Making friends isn't my strong suit either. Really? Who do you call then, if not friends? What about Rybak? Isn't he one of your friends? Is he alive or dead, this Viktor Rybak? - Where d'you get that? - The hotel lounge. It fell out of your jacket. Why didn't you give it back? I tried to. Then I began reading it and I couldn't stop. Is it all true? What do you want? To know what you're up to. March, 13th. First days, first treatments. Head and body-hair shaved. The nurses are regular prisoners. They take their anger out on me. My hairless balls make them laugh. I am an old man of 8 years old. March, 31st. Psychopaths, murderers, paranoids. Rivka, you'd like my new luxury residence for enemies of the people. The psychiatrist smiles and says, "You're sick." "You must be, if you want to leave the Soviet paradise." "Renounce your visa and you're cured." "You can get your old job back." But what about my wife and son? "You must repudiate them." January, 1st. They killed Oleg with a shot of sulfazine. He writhed in pain for 3 days. I called all night, the nurses never came. He died this morning. Officially, it's a suicide. Oleg was a physicist like me. February, 18th. Ponomarev killed his wife. He's a real crazy who laughs all the time. I tipped the chamber pot on his head. I hit him so he'd shut up. Even when he does, I hit him some more. I'd keep hitting him even if he was dead. They gave me a jab so I'd sleep. Soon as they're gone, I'll make him eat shit. April, 21st. I sleep, I beat off, I sleep. My dear wife Rivka, my flower, I prayed to see you again in that little blue dress you so loved. June, 21st. I woke up last night. I had forgotten your face, forgotten your breasts, the softness of your buttocks. Your form has melted away, your name been erased. I prayed for God to return you to me. He couldn't find you. I rubbed my member. It wouldn't stand up. "I'm dead," I thought, without you in my thoughts. I don't understand why she didn't come home. Something must have happened. You can have fun in Odessa, too. Do you know Anton? Playing guitar at the party. Drink. Don't be difficult. If it makes you happy. You two are getting on my nerves. One thinks he's going to die, the other only thinks about his cousin. In the Bible, all the patriarchs were married to their cousins. But they were all polygamous. You're not polygamous, are you? That must be David. Have him wait a moment. Alright. I... I read it. It's... I don't know what to say. It's dumb. But thank you. I'm glad you read it. I wrote it for my wife. She doesn't know about any of this. They want to publish it, to apply pressure, so I'm allowed to leave. - They're right. - No. In any case, physicists don't get out. Why not publish it? I just don't want that. I wrote it for her. There are many very private passages. Well, you read it. Now my life is over. I was born here, I'll die here. And this is all I leave behind. It's for Rivka's eyes only. You want me to take it to her? Tell her that every day for 10 years, I kept breathing for her. You are in my heart, like my son. I'll explain to you how to get around customs. When are you coming back? In 6 months. What are you doing here? Saying goodbye. We leave tomorrow. Get your case packed? Don't carry any excess baggage, there can be hefty penalties. I don't follow you. Just a word of warning. I'd better be off. I'm coming over antisemitic. - You're making progress. - Knock it off, guys. David, go on in. He's waiting. Here, it's for you. Is that to apologize for abandoning me last night? Go on, on your way. My shoes. Jérôme? Are you cross? Don't sulk. What were you up to? - Where were you? - Not now... You were with Anton, is that it? Jérôme, shhh. Shit, it's not that hard to lie! I don't want to. Make up something plausible. Or what, you're going to strangle me? No, you turn me on too much. I love your skin so much. I love your perfume. Every night, I couldn't sleep for your smell. Is that true? 'Course it is. What about you? What about me, what? Any regrets? Are you kidding? What are you doing? What are you doing? Don't move. What's that? It's Viktor's. The book David wanted? Yes. Viktor didn't want him to have it. He doesn't want it published. He wants me to take it to his wife. He wrote it for her. I read it Carole, it's amazing. When did he give it to you? The night we went to his place. But I was there... What's in it? I'll tell you. You mustn't smuggle it, you know. That would be mad. You were searched on the way in. Don't worry. My friends, my dear friends, all good things must come to an end. I hope you've all had a great trip, and you're leaving with heads full of wonderful memories. I also hope that you might have overcome a few prejudices. Otherwise, what was the point? Anti-Sovietism is not an incurable disease. I'm living proof. To friendship between nations! To friendship! Cheers. Léon, let's have a photo. Come on. No, I'm fine. With Jérôme? Alright. That's it. Great! Ah, even a smile from Jérôme. Carole, you there? Wait five seconds! Count up to five. I love you. How do you love me? Like this. Keep going, keep going, don't stop. Tell me you love me. I love you. I don't believe you. I love you more than life itself. Passport? Suitcase. Smoking is forbidden. You're coming with me. Remove your jacket! Come on, give me a hand! Take your shirt off. Take your shirt off! Get a move on! Hurry up! What the hell is this? Pick that up. We'll see what you've been hiding. Are you taking the piss? What's all this crap? You should've used me, I'm a minor. They wouldn't search me. I could've smuggled the book. What will they do to him? How are you? - Give me your case. - I'm fine, thanks. I'm sorry. We called the embassy every day. The Russians were furious, they felt duped. As if... That's why they kept you. We couldn't do much else, just let things cool off. Where's the diary? Carole went to Israel to take it to Rivka. Look. There's a piece in the NY Times, an article next week in Time, and the book's coming out. If that doesn't get him out... What about his wife? Has she read it? She agrees? His wife is gravely ill. What's she got? Cancer. She's in a coma. What about Viktor? Does he know about that? No. Why get him out then? What's he going to do there alone? You don't give a shit. One more Jew in Israel is all that counts. It's one less Jew being persecuted elsewhere. If you'd been caught with the book they'd have killed Viktor, and you'd still be in jail. You should thank Carole. Jérôme, it's Carole. She won't take no. Hello? He's sleeping. Last night, yes, yes. He didn't sleep all night, which explains why... We were worried sick, but it's over now. I'll tell him. All my love, sweetie. Why don't you want to talk to your cousin? She was worried too. She called us every day. Your writing is a real mess. Can I read it? Why are you writing this? I don't know, it's... I don't know, mama. It's for you, it's for me. That's nice. Has it got a title? "Diary of a Little Asshole". That's a good title. My God! You look such a state when you smile. That'll be her, you better answer. Ten years later Hi, Dan. Of course, I was up all night. But I thought you were sending Oury to Berlin. I'd love to go there. Yes, but I've got my son this week. You're not asleep? I dreamt I went on a journey. With me? Liar! I'm sure you're lying to me. We were... We were at the airport. We were going somewhere sunny, and just when we had to board, we both climbed into our suitcases. You know, I got a call from Israel. So, shall we go? Will you come this time? Every time I go on my own. I can't believe it. I'm afraid it's just a sick joke. I just spoke to Ivan. He's stuck in Montreal, he won't be coming. I'm sorry. Hello, dear friends. Just a few words before the party gets started. I'm delighted that you could all come. I had to convince Viktor to celebrate his birthday. If you ask him what he thinks, he'll say birthdays are a capitalist invention. I'm going to speak Russian. In a hospital, two men are sharing a room. The first is in a bed by the corridor, the other by the window. He looks out of the window and tells the first guy all the things he can't see. He describes the lovely courtyard, where at times, the nurses sun themselves, or else dash through the rain, naked under their scrubs. And the distant river, where children swim and splash about. His companion listens, eyes closed. He only lives for these moments. Then one day, the man by the window dies. The other guy asks to have his spot. He wants to look out of the window and enjoy the view. But what does he see? A wall. A huge wall, blackened with filth. I tell you all this to show that the only freedom we have is that of choosing one's bed - by the window, or by the corridor. Good health! Shall we say hello? - It's funny seeing you. - I didn't expect you. - You look well. - Thank you. So how are things? This weather's strange. It's usually hot. I put in A/C at home, makes life easier. Everyone's got it now. Really? The prices have come down a lot. It's just a little noisy. I better get back to it. See you later. Is that all you have to say, after so long? Look at me. I'm glad you came. Sit. Vera! Come see who's here. Bottoms up! I'm hungry, Viktor. Not saying hello to your cousin? This is Antoine, Carole's son. Are you my cousin? Yes. How old are you, Antoine? Nearly nine-and-a-half. It's a good party. I don't know... Sure, I think it's nice anyway. He always has to do his old nihilist routine. He could make an effort, while we're doing our best to make it festive. I liked it. Calm down, Antoine. He's a good-looking kid. Antoine... Anton. What? Don't tell me you never thought of that. He's not Anton's son, in fact. He's not David's either. Turn round, you two. A family snapshot, come on! Smile! I'll fetch some drinks. What does all this mean? He has your dimples when he smiles. This can't be true. How long have you known? Always. Why didn't you tell me? I couldn't. So when would I have found out? Does your son know? Are you lying to him, too? It's our secret. Nobody needs to know. You're completely crazy. Come. Why did you leave me? Why? - I didn't leave you. - You did. I live with you, I'm watching you grow up. Didn't you tell Vera that we're married forever? Mama, where are you? We're going to blow out the candles. Again, again. Papa's tired. Again, Papa! Are you OK? Have you met Antoine? We've met, he's my cousin. He's your mother's cousin. Where's Mama? Viktor said I could blow out the candles. She must be upstairs. That way! Where are you going? Up there! Wait for me! So, how's life? I'm going to lie on a bed by the corridor. Come here, Antoine. Mama. I'm with him. Where's Mama? She can't be far away. I've got a feeling she's cross with me. She so wanted this to be a nice party. You know my son, Ivan? He lives in Canada, he never visits. In 10 years, I've only seen him twice. What would I do without her? Mama! It's boiling!
