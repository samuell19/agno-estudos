Take cover, gentlemen! Now! - Where's your weapon? - Getting it now, sir! Shit. I want all three platoon leaders to get me bearings on where those mortars are coming from. Roger that. HQ says they're 61s coming in from Long Phuoc. Well, tell HQ they're wrong. They're 82s and they're coming in from Long Tan. Yes, sir. I shall inform HQ of the error of their ways. Hmm. Four call signs, this is 4. Request urgent sitrep on mortar bearings. Over. We're under attack, and your first instinct is to get me a cup of tea? Get the hell out. Leave that! See you brought your tortoise, Morrie. He's a turtle. He's my mate. Your only mate. - Come on, Murray! - Oh, fucking hell! Is it incoming or outgoing? Platoon leaders are working on the bearings now, sir. Three minutes. Maybe tell them to hurry the fuck up. How about that? All four call signs, this is 4. We need those bearings now! Over. I fold, boss. All right? I'll see your two. And I'll raise you five. That fire is incoming, Lieutenant Sharp. Keep your pants on, Sarge. Can't you see we're in the middle of a game? Fuck! Private Grice, call Major Smith. Tell him we have a bearing of 54 degrees from 11 Platoon HQ on those mortars. Right away, Sarge. Lieutenant, we are under enemy attack. This could well be a move to take the base. I suggest you order 11 Platoon to stand to. Just give us a minute, Bob. I'm cleaning up here! All of you! Get your weapons, man your positions, and stand fucking to! That means you, Lieutenant! Repeat. Need accurate triangulated bearings on incoming mortar rounds to be able to direct return fire. Who keeps leaving the pins in my map? I mean, honestly, is it that hard to clean up after a briefing? Any soldier not manning a radio, out now! Senior officers excepted, Colonel. ♪ No, I wouldn't tell a story ♪ ♪ No, I wouldn't lie ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ We're all good, mate. You know, the Kiwi artillery is going to light up the jack bastards as soon as they get a fix on 'em. No. We're under attack. Not here, we're not. Go on. Besides, if your number is up... may as well get a buzz on. ♪ Uh-huh... ♪ Sir! I have a bearing for those mortars. Congratulations, Dave. You're the last platoon leader to get it done. Take a bow. Triangulate those bearings, then call it in. Isn't that the base gunner's job? No, Morrie, it's yours. You find the enemy and you direct the artillery onto them. Yes, sir. You going to the concert tomorrow? Maybe. Who's playing again? Cole Joye and the Joy Boys. They're flying in tomorrow morning. - You like Cole Joye, don't you? - Not really. Hey, what about Little Pattie? You've got to like Little Pattie. Yeah, she's an angel. The way she sings that "Surfer Boy" song. God, she's flying in tomorrow. - Little Pattie is? - Yeah, you wanna meet her? - What, you know Little Pattie? - We're like this. He's just running through the bush! Over there! Find out what idiot did that. Yes, sir! 3, this is 3-4. Fire Mission Battery. Read you, 4-5-9. It's 6-7-1. Over. Gotcha! Fire Mission Battery. Bearing: 1-9-1-0. Range: 2-9-0-5. Bearing: 1-9-1-0. Range: 2-9-0-5. Ready! Have some of this, you bastards. Fire! It appears the enemy knows exactly what he's doing. He's targeted our guns, our task force headquarters. The count is one dead, 23 wounded. However, artillery have driven him back, and now we're going after him. One Company will move out beyond the wire and they'll patrol east into the rubber plantation at Long Tan where the enemy mortars came from. We're calling it Operation Vendetta. Delta Company volunteers to go, sir. Yes, thank you, Harry. This will be Bravo. Noel, you leave in an hour, so prepare to stay overnight. Colonel, I've got 48 men due for leave tomorrow. Well, just send them back in the morning. That will cut our strength down to 32, sir. Yes! Thank you, Noel. I can count. Got 108 men prepared to stay out there all week, sir. There are other companies in the battalion besides yours, Harry. Not trained by me, though, sir. As commanding officer of this battalion, it is my decision whose mission this is. Understood? ♪ You keep sayin' You got something for me ♪ ♪ Something you call love But confess ♪ ♪ You've been a-messin' ♪ ♪ Where you shouldn't Have been a-messin' ♪ ♪ And now someone else... ♪ - Private Whiston? - Yes, Sarge. - That makes you Private Topp. - Yes, Sergeant. You blokes are with me in 11 Platoon. ♪ One of these days These boots ♪ ♪ Are gonna walk All over you ♪ Delta is the best company in the battalion. We work harder, march further and shoot straighter than anybody else. We're proud of that fact. Major Smith as tough as they say? Tougher. The Ratcatcher fought Communist and guerrilla forces in Malaya in '56, so he knows this brand of stink. Trained with the commandos in Melbourne, now he runs Delta to commando standards. That means you'll have your shirts on at all times, your sleeves rolled down, your fronts buttoned up. Silence your dog tags with electrical tape. Put your kit bag where the book says it should go. And no coughing or farting before breakfast. Serious? Welcome to Hotel Nui Dat. Private Large, sir. Ah! Come in, Private. Mind if I take a look? Hmm. You prefer this over the SLR? She's lighter than the SLR. Doesn't hit as hard, though. She jams a lot. - You a good shot? - Real good. Yeah, I grew up hunting rabbits out the back of me house. The back of your house? - Where are you from? - Coolah. - New South Wales. - Yeah, I know where it is. There's good farm country, right? Yeah. Well, how come, then, if you're such a good shot, how did you miss that enemy soldier last night? Well, it was dark. And he was running... really fast. You think this is funny, don't you? Huh? What kind of funny? Funny like, eh, Bugs Bunny funny? Fart funny? Or more like Lucille Ball funny? I think you're funny. Tell you the truth... I think you're a fucking joke. - Sir, I can't breathe. - That's because I'm choking you. I'm cutting off all the air to your worthless lungs, doing everyone a favor. You see, there's a thousand ways to die in a war zone. Nobody asks too many questions when another grunt gets listed killed in action. Now, funnyman, tell me the truth. And if I hear one more bullshit lie about you shooting at enemy soldiers, I'll send you back to Coolah in a wooden fucking box. I fucked up. Private, what do you think is the most important element in a firefight? Killing the enemy, sir. Trust. You have to trust the man beside you and he has to trust you. My mates trust me. Well, when you fire your weapon off without meaning to, they don't. Now, do you think you can pick that up without shooting me? Dismissed. Reckon they'll try us again, Paddy? They were probing us. Testing our reaction. It's what you do before you launch a full-scale attack. Can't overrun the base, can they? Ever heard of Dien Bien Phu? No. Good. Thirteen years in the army, I've never seen any company trained half as hard as Delta. You really put these boys through it, and you're still pushing them to the point of punishment. I've gone along with it because I've seen this shit. I know it could save their lives one day. But I'm not sure that's why you're doing it. They're not commandos, but they are your men. They've done everything you've asked of them and more. They deserve your respect. Sir. Zero 1, this is Bravo 1. Have completed our search of the Long Tan area. Located six mortar base plates, 22 recoilless rifle shell cases, and body parts. Enemy is Kilo India Alpha. Say again. All enemy is Kilo India Alpha. There's nothing out here. Bravo 1 out. Copy that, Bravo. Sending Delta out in the morning to relieve you. Over. A word please, sir. Keep the mosquitoes out, would you? Water? No, thank you, sir. The place is like a bloody furnace. You get used to it. Is that how it was for you blokes in Malaya? Wish I'd been able to join you for that one. Heard it was a helluva good show. You've got two minutes, Harry. Sir, I'm a soldier. My father was a soldier. And it is a profession that I hold dear. It is sacred. I should be in command of other professionals, yet I find myself here, breast-feeding a bunch of kids, conscripts. Frankly, sir, it's a waste of my experience and my skills. I need to be elsewhere. You were a conscript yourself, weren't you? I did my 90 days. But then I signed up for the regular army. Duntroon? Portsea. Didn't you want to go to Duntroon? Not all of us have the, eh, educational requirements to get into Duntroon, sir. And yet somehow you still feel that you have the right to come in here and ask for a transfer. To what? Something better? Nothing personal, sir. Where do you want to go? Special forces, commandos. Back with your old unit? Back with commanding officers that understand and appreciate the services I provide. Unlike, say, Colonel Townsend? You don't like Colonel Townsend. Ask me if I give a shit. He's your commanding officer and you will follow his orders, just like he follows mine, because that's the way the army works, in case you haven't noticed. Was there anything else, Major? Zero 1, this is Albatross 1, on approach with the special package. Copy that, Albatross 1. Clear to land. Over. What's your name? David. Thanks so much, David. - What's your name? - Mark Walsh. Thank you. Thanks so much. - See you. - Cheers. - Miss Pattie! - No talking to the talent. I'm Private Large. This is Private Grimes. We've been assigned to base entertainment liaison. Brigadier's orders. Priority Alpha. Go and help the Joy Boys unload. What the hell is Priority Alpha? Did you hear me, Private? Go! No Priority Alpha, is there? Imagine his face when he realizes that. This is, eh, Private Grimes. He's probably your biggest fan. Oh, so sweet! Coming to the concert? Wouldn't miss it. He's, eh, been struggling to find enough motivation to do his duties for Queen and country. Just wondering if you'd be able to... help him? - One kiss. - Oh! One kiss, cheeks acceptable. Mwah! - Motivated now? - Very motivated. Thanks, Miss. Uh, Pattie, this has been... this has been fun. Good luck with the show. Maybe give us a wave. We'll be down the front. Hooroo! Attention! We're heading to Long Tan. We'll be relieving Bravo, who's been out there all night with exactly zero enemy contact. Now, we're a day late and a dollar short. But if there is something out there, we will find it. We move out at 1100 hours. Questions, queries, doubtful points? Guess we're not going to the concert. Looks like we'll be missing it. Yeah, looks like we'll be the only ones missing it. Colonel's got the shits with the major - and we copped the short end of the stick. - Oi! We're not here to fuck spiders.

Because when the rations get scarce, that's what he fucking eats. Language, Paddy. I heard that he burrows out the innards of enemy KIA, then lays traps inside all the blood and the guts and the intestines. Thank you, Sergeant. That'll do. He doesn't give two shits about us, does he? That's not his job, Private. It's ours. What's out there, Mr. Sharp? Maybe a VC platoon. Oh, it's all right. Just your typical shoot and scoot. We're not gonna find anything. With any luck, Lieutenant. Looks like artillery was spot-on. Where do those blood trails go? North towards the hills and east towards Long Tan. North has footprints, but east has bullock cart tracks. You want a fight, sir? Catch up to that bullock cart. Typical. You blokes can go home and enjoy the music, while we have to stay out here and face it. Lieutenant Sharp. You're the new lead platoon. Gonna keep heading east. There's bullock cart tracks. Follow any trails. Yes, Jack. 11 Platoon! Form up on me! Pull your head in. Show me you're a leader. Cocky little prick, isn't he? If he listens to me, he'll be all right.

I've got to see where the shells land. You won't see anything without a fucking head! Now, stay down! - Get me up to speed, Colonel. - Sir. Delta Company is here, about five kilometers away in the rubber. 11 Platoon are 400 meters forward of the rest of the company. And they're pinned down and they're taking casualties. 10 Platoon is here, and they're trying to get to 11. Company HQ... and 12... are about 200 meters behind 10. The enemy is here and here. And they're flanking 11 on all sides. Enemy strength estimates? Uh, Major Smith says it might be a platoon, sir. Well, Delta can handle a platoon. Suppressing fire! 2 o'clock! 80 meters!

Stop dicking about. Get up. I can't plot artillery strikes while we're moving. We have to get to them. I've got to control the arty. Major, if I make one mistake, you will lose men. Stop here.

It's Hornung from 10. I couldn't raise you, sir. Radio is buggered. We were taking wounded by the second. Is 10 withdrawing? Too much fire. Can't move without comms. You'll be right. There's hundreds of them. Hey. You get any of them, mate? We got a lot of them. Before we got hit, we got a lot of the bastards. - You all right here? - Yeah. No news from 10. Must be copping it as bad as 11. Where you going? I'm going to find a way through to 11 Platoon, OK? - What? - Just cover me. But, Largie... Largie, get back! - You wanted to see me, sir? - Delta is in trouble. How many APCs have you got available? 12, sir. But the tracks on two of them aren't operational. - Prepare to move out. - Very good, sir. Wait one on that order, Lieutenant. Bravo! Bravo! Where's the rest of your section? They're all gone, sir! Halls, go give Robbo a hand. Yes, Sergeant. Get onto the right flank. Ainslie, get a head count on the wounded. Contact rear! Sniper in the hut! Eggie! Rake the hut! Rake the hut! Arggh! James!

Zero 1. This is Delta 1. New enemy size estimate. Greater than your call sign. I repeat, enemy size greater than your call sign. A battalion. That's 700 or 800 men. We need reinforcements. Send out the APCs. Over. Also request Uniform Sierra air support. Over. Captain? The Americans should have something up nearby. Well, you're in charge of air support. It's your call. Get me US Group Command. Agh! Cease fire! All guns cease fire. Cease fire! Cease fire! There! Smoke grenade! Who's got smoke? Justin? Richmond? McCormack's got one! Tell them to throw smoke. 4-2, this is 4. Throw smoke. Throw the smoke! Throw it now! Fuck! This is Blue Leader. I've got nothing up here. No visual on smoke. Blue Leader, acknowledge.

Rock 'n' roll. Hope that spooked them. Good luck down there. Fuck! Cease fire! Boys, boys! 11! Behind me! Sound off. Ammo count. Heslewood. Out! Magnussen. One round! Eglinton. About 10 rounds! Meller. I have one shot! We're not going to make it! 3-4, this is 4-2. We cannot move. Almost out of ammo. Request target on my location. Over. This is 3-4. Say again. Over. I need Sheldrake to drop on my position. Over. He wants me to target his position. This is 4. Say again. Over. 4, this is 4-2. We are being flanked on all sides. About to be overrun. Target my location. Over. This is 3-4. Negative. I can't do it. Over. If you don't drop in the next 30 seconds, we'll all be dead! Do you understand me? Over! Sir, we can't allow this. Major's the commanding officer in the field. He'll make the call. Call it in. Boss... I am not taking the responsibility. I'll take the bloody responsibility. Now, call it in. Fire! 4-2, this is 4. Over. 4-2, this is 4. Over. 4-2. Acknowledge. Over. 4-2. Acknowledge. Over. Bob, can you hear me, mate? Doc? - He stabilized? - Yeah. I'm more worried about the ones still out there. That last drop sounded close. Yeah, the major brought it down right on top of 11. I've found a way through to 11 Platoon. There is no 11 Platoon. Major Smith called in artillery on their position. You fucking prick! - Private! - You fucking bastard! You don't give a shit about any of us, do you? Just say it! Just fucking say it! What about trust? What about all that shit you told me about your mates trusting you? Stand down, Private. How can we trust you now? I said stand down. - Ugh! - Arggh! - Get down! - Contact right! Contact right! Keep an eye out for invaders. 12 o'clock. Morrie, radio! Zero 1, this is Delta 1. Enemy fire on my location. Where are your reinforcements? Over. Sir, I can have Alpha Company loaded onto my APCs in 15 minutes. No. They're up against an entire battalion out there, maybe more. It's a trap. They're luring us out so they can attack the base. What about 11 Platoon, sir? 11 Platoon is dead. Delta 1, this is Zero 1. No reinforcements available at this time. The mission has changed, Major. Return to the base immediately. Over. Delta 1, this is Zero 1. Confirm new mission orders. Over. Do you read, Delta 1? Withdraw at once and fall back to base. Those are my orders. Over. Zero 1, this is Delta 1. You can go and fuck your orders. Say again, Delta 1. Say again. We all come back, or no one does. Delta 1 out. Get control of your man, Colonel. Delta 1, this is Zero 1. You are ordered to return to the base. What are you smiling about? I'm always smiling, sir. New plan? Find 11. Rescue any survivors. And hope to hell there are some. I found a way through to 11. - What are you talking about? - I can show you. Dave! Dave! Sir? Private Large is gonna take you to 11 Platoon's location. Leave one section here. Go, boys! Paddy! 12 is moving out. On me. Let's go. Miller, keep your section here. We need to know what's happening with 10 Platoon. They still have no radio. Akell! Get here. Here. I need you to get that radio to 10 Platoon. You reckon you can do that for me? - Yes, sir. - Attaboy. Good man. All right. Run as fast as you bloody can. Go, lads! Go on! Go! Run like hell! Let's go and see what's happening, eh? Zero 1, this is Delta 1. Request ammo resupply. Over. Delta 1, you are again ordered to return to base. Over. Zero 1, if you do not send ammo, you will lose the bloody lot of us. It's that simple. In this weather, with no secure LZ, I'm afraid I can't authorize that. You don't have to authorize it, Captain. I'll go on my own accord. Nobody's leaving the base. I'm in charge of air support, sir. It's my call. It's mine. I'm the commander of my aircraft. I have the right to make tactical decisions in the field. You're not in the field. In 10 minutes, I will be. Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Mr. Kendall! Mr. Kendall! Over here! I've got a radio for you, sir. Where the hell did you come from? - Company HQ, sir. - Good one, Yank! 4, this is 4-1. 10 Platoon's back on air, sir! The kid made it! 4-1, this is 4. Sitrep. We're pinned down by enemy fire on three sides. Taking casualties. Running low on ammo. We can't proceed to 4-2. Over. All right, withdraw with your wounded to my location. Over. Roger. Withdraw. Over. 10 Platoon! Withdraw to HQ! Fire and move! First section! Rifle group, move! - Move! - Let's go, let's go. Scout group! Scout group! Go! Go! Let's go, boys! Let's get this ammo on the choppers, now! Come on, let's go! - It's a suicide mission. - Yeah, well, nobody has to go. Volunteers only. Answer me honestly. Do you reckon we're gonna get shot down? Honestly? Yep. Jesus, mate. You could've at least lied to me. This is Albatross 1. Clear for departure. Delta 1, this is Albatross 1. Ammo is on its way. Ammo's coming! - Grab a section! - Yes, boss. Cease fire! Cease fire! Cease fire! Cease fire! Large, how much further? 200 meters. - Contact right! - Contact right! 100 meters! 12 o'clock! - Pick your shots! - 80 meters! Jesus Christ! Albatross 1, this is Delta 1. In position. Over. Delta 1, this is Albatross 1. Throw smoke. Over. Roger that. Popping smoke now. Over. Shit! 10 o'clock! Delta 1, this is Albatross 1. I see red smoke. Over. Affirmative! Affirmative! Over! Approaching drop zone now. Copy that, Albatross 1. Rolling... now! Jack, get out of there! Albatross 2, you're on. Copy that, Albatross 1. Albatross 1, you bloody beauty. - Spot-on, mate. - Good luck, Delta 1. Zero 1, this is Albatross 1. Ammo drop complete. Returning to base. Separate 5.56 from the 7.62. Let's get these first-aid kits and the blankets to the wounded. Double time, gents. Let's keep our boys in the fight! Make sure everyone gets ammo. Everyone! Get the artillery back up. Go. Yes. Willy, on me! Don't shoot the hut. 11's up there somewhere! Arggh! Arggh! Oh, shit! Kev, mate, can you crawl back to HQ? Ha! Crawl? I'll fucking run! Paddy! Come on. Come on. Head out. Double time, boys. Three mags each, then we're on our feet. Large! Sir? You got a smoke grenade? Yes, sir! Where do you want it? Up towards 11. If any one of them are still alive up there, they'll... they'll know it's us, they'll know where to come. Private! I'll need this to be a bloody long throw, you hear me? Mr. Sabben, I reckon that's the first time I've ever heard you swear! Not the last. Cease fire! Cease fire! I reckon they've gone, Skip. Wave your hats if you're Australian! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Mate... How are you, mate? How are you? Give us a smoke, Paddy. Thanks, mate. What about the others? Contact left! Contact! Contact! Contact! Left! Give me the radio. 4, this is 4-3. We've got 11. We have 'em. Good work, Lieutenant. Bring them on back. Zero 1, this is Delta 1. 11 Platoon is secure. I say again, 11 is secure. Request you send APCs to our position immediately. Over. Sir, request permission to lead the APCs out to Delta Company. If I lose my APCs, I will have one infantry company left to protect this entire base. That's 100 men defending 300 support staff. And my intel reports tell me there is a second, full-sized enemy regiment moving in on us from the west. Sir, there's a chance to save Delta now. Delta is down to less than half strength. Delta is finished. I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong. If Major Smith can hold and the APCs can break up the attack, then I can secure the base by taking the fight to the enemy. History will judge us, gentlemen. - Send out the APCs. - Yes, sir. You put on a good show, don't you? A show? Do you think I'm going to let you duck the fallout from this? Sir, I'm needed in the field. You are needed where I say you are needed. And right now, that is here by my side... as we lose an entire company of men. Withdraw to HQ! 11, on me, go! - 11, go! - 11, go! 12, go! 12, go! 12, go! Fire and move! 12, go! 3 Troop! Start up! - Sarge! Get it moving! - Yes, boss. Oi! Doc! Thank God you're alive. That would've been bloody embarrassing. Thanks for doing what I asked. If you hadn't, none of us would be here. Boss. My blokes can still fight. We're gonna need them to. The enemy's gonna come for us, and they're gonna come hard. We killed a lot of their mates today and they're gonna want revenge. We can't travel our wounded, so we're gonna have to hold tight. Conserve your ammo. Make sure your men are focused. Questions? Where's Gordon Sharp? He's dead. Let's make sure we don't lose any more. - Let's go. - Sir. This is 3-9 Alpha. We are leaving the base perimeter. Copy that, 3-9 Alpha. Delta 1, this is Zero 1. APCs are on the way. ETA one hour. Can you hold? We don't have a choice, do we? Delta 1 will hold. Gentlemen, listen up. I want every rifleman, clerk, cook, pilot and engineer in a defensive position around this base. And I want them there now. All units stand to. Repeat, all units stand to. Prepare for enemy attack. Private Large. Sit down. So what do you reckon's going on back home, back in Coolah? Wh-What? My place? What time do you reckon it is there? I don't know. It's late. Mum and Dad would be just watching telly, you know, like always. Having a smoke and a beer. And maybe my sisters are home for dinner, their little kids running around, causing strife. Maybe... maybe Noelene's there. Who's Noelene? Fiancée. Getting married, huh? I just want to get out of here and go home, get married, and forget all this. Come on. Back to your post. There! 1 o'clock! - No, wait! Cease fire! - Don't shoot, you bastards! Paddy? Buddy? - Is that you, mate? - Cover me. Me ankles are buggered. Why didn't you tell the others? They would've carried you back. Ah, I didn't want to be any trouble. - Oh, you silly galah. - Hey, Buddy. Have a look there. Oh, that's Bravo Company boys. Don't worry about it. Well, they must've changed their uniforms, mate, because they're all in black. Oh, shit. Jack! You'll be right, mate. Hang in there, OK? Under his shoulders, on three. One, two, three! Down, down. Gently down. Thanks, Jack. Oh, blood. Oh, bugger. I'm shot. Bastards got me. Ugh! Get off my fucking legs! Jesus! Some bloody rescuer you are! Jack! This is 3-9 Alpha. Crossing the field now. ETA at Delta, 45 minutes. Roger that, 3-9 Alpha. Permission to check on base defenses, sir. If you must, Colonel. Private, you're with me. Get me 3-9 Alpha. 3-9 Alpha, this is Zero 1 Sunray.

Tell them to wait for me at the track. And do not go without me. 3-9 Alpha, you are ordered to hold at the track and wait for the Colonel. - Confirm. Over. - Driver, halt. Fuck! Joey, stay here and wait for the Colonel. Catch up to us later. Driver, advance. Forget the bloody map! We know where they fucking are! Bring it in, quickly. It's only 100 meters out. And them bastards are closer than that. 3-4. Drop 50. Danger close! Over. Negative. Unsafe. Over. Give us the fucking guns where we want them or you'll lose the lot of us! Drop 50. Danger close. Danger close. Fire for effect! Fuck! Everyone load! - Drop this thing! - Load! Come on! Fire! No! Wait! Stop! Too close! Cease fire! Cease fire! Fuck. Cease fire. Cease fire. Cease fire! Cease fire! - Cease fire! - Cease fire! - - Christ. What's going on? - Anyone hurt? - Good, boss. We're good, Major. Few brown trousers, but we're good! - Shrink the perimeter! - Shrink the perimeter! Shrink the perimeter! - Shrink the perimeter! - This line. Contact front! Agh! Fuck! Why is it so quiet? Fuck, I hate it when it's quiet. - How you going, sheilas? - Hanging in there. Reckon you got enough in you to fend off one more wave? Yeah, I reckon so. They're not getting through us. So when's the wedding? Fishing for an invite, Major Smith? Maybe I am. Hey, you... you've got to bring somebody. Just to prove that you're human. That's Kath. And the little rats. The Ratcatcher has a heart. I accept your invite. Speech time. Listen up, fellas. You've trained for this. You've sweated for this. You've bled for it. Remember who you are. You're Delta Company. Now stay strong. Protect your mates. Make every shot count. Yes, boss! We're not gonna make it, are we? 3, this is 3-4. Fire Mission Regiment. Over. 3... I've got Delta back online, sir.
