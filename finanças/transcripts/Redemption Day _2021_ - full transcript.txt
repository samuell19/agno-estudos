[chattering] - [man] Hoorah. - [soldiers] Hoorah! - [chattering] - [barbells clanking] [soldier] Over here! [man on radio] Paxton, we need you in here. On my way, sir. [soldier] Morning, sir! [soldier 2] Come on, let's help load up. [Paxton] Yo. [soldier] Keep practicing. [soldier 2] There it is. Thanks, man. [Paxton] Commander, sir! [commander] Captain. - You sure? - It's coming from the top. Somebody's pet project in Washington. They negotiated passage with ISIS. They won't be in your way. This medical equipment needs to get there soon. Children are dying as we speak. Copy that, sir. - Be safe. - I'll try. Let's rally up, guys. We're headin' out. [man] Yes, sir. - Pinto, could you grab my vest? - [Pinto] Copy. [helicopter blades whirring] - Here you go, sir. - Good lookin' out. - Hey, Younes! - Brother. - Good to see you. - Same here. Good to have you with us. - How have you been? - Good. It's choppy waters we're navigating today. - No easy dame. - No. - Stay crispy, my friend, on the road. - Stay safe. [wind whistling] Let's go, ladies! Time to make the donuts! Chop chop! [explosion] [soldier] We need backup here! [gunfire, explosions] [soldiers shouting] [grunts] Cover me! Are you all right? We're gonna get you out of here. Okay? We're gonna get you out of here. You ready? Let's go! [high-pitched whine] [cries out] Baby? Brad. Hey. Brad, it's Kate. You're home, okay? [gasps] - Hey. - [gasps, grunts] - Hey. - [grunts] [groans] - [grunts] - Brad. Brad. [sizzling] [sighs] - Hey. - Hey. [kisses] [sighs deeply] - Coffee? - Mm. - Thank you. - Yes. [sighs, grunts] You wanna talk about it? - [Kate] Hey, kiddo. - Good morning. - Hey, baby girl. - [Kate] Good morning. I missed you. Missed you too, love bug. [kiss] I made your favorite breakfast this morning. Yes! Pancake. - Pancakes. - [Brad] Pancake. - [Kate] Oh! - Get your own! - [all exclaim] - Oh, my God, this is so good. Dad, are you taking me to school today? Today and every day. Pancake? Please. [sighs] - [man] Yeah, yeah, what's up? - What's up? [boxers grunting] - Give me two. - [grunting] Give me three. - Ho! - Not bad for an old man. - Hey, son. - Hey. Come here. Let me kick your baby ass. What's up, champ? - I'm good. - You look good, man. - Ooh. Let's do it. - All right. Come on, son, show me what you got. All right. Give me two. What's going on with you? - You're hitting like a little girl. - [chuckles] I'm just warming up, Pop, come on. Son, jab cross. Come on. There you go. Listen, son, I'm your father. Yeah, someone told me that. I also happen to know what I'm talking about. Give me two. Look, those nightmares you're having? They ain't going away, all right? You need to do something about them. All right? These things can shut you down like that. Deeper than you know. Okay? And you need to let someone... me, somebody... help you. Can you do that? Huh? [sighs] Pop, I... I'm fine, okay? All right, give me two. Give me two. Come on! Okay, and anything can trigger, all right? - I won't let it happen. - All right. Give me two. Come on. There you go. All right. And another thing, son... Hey, I'm not gonna come into the ring and talk about my wife. Give me two. Oh! All right, look. Listen, Kate, she's a great mother. - She's taken a lot on. - Come on, Pop. And for her sake, trust me. - Yeah. - Respect her love for you. Can you do that? - Yeah. - Okay. That's my boy. - Yes, sir. - All right, show me what you got! What you got! Ho! Ho! That's my boy! Give me two. Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! - [grunting] - Ho! What you got, what you got, what you got? [both laughing] [Kate] Okay. And... we saved the best for last. In Morocco, on the edge of the Sahara desert, near what is now the Algerian border, a team of archaeologists were exploring the depths of an abandoned mine when they came across something incredible. 315,000-year-old human bones... - [crowd gasps] - ...which shake the foundation of human history to its core. Because scientific research has believed that human origins started 200,000 years ago, and in eastern Africa. So it was believed that humanity spread out and then populated the world. But this discovery in Morocco is changing all of that. It's making us examine our belief of where and when humans first walked on Earth. - [crowd murmuring] - So... I contacted my friends at NASA, and I asked for their help. And this is what we found. [crowd exclaims] Ladies and gentlemen, it is without a doubt that we have found a large, ancient city of unknown origin under the desert. Now, I've been working closely with the Moroccan antiquity authorities, and I am proud to say that myself and my team here have been granted access to excavate. [crowd applauding] [sighs] [exhales] [high-pitched whine] [gunfire] - [soldier groaning] - Hey. Stay with me! Stay with me, come on! Younes! Younes! Take him and get back to the base. They don't want us, they just want the meds and the doctors, all right? - I'm not leaving you here! - Get back to the base and get me some backup! [reporter on TV] The President awarded the country's highest military honor... - Hey, Clair. Come on. - ...to Marine Corps Captain Bradley Paxton, who, while serving in Syria... - Sit with your grandpa! - ...held back a military ISIS ambush. - You were lying on the ground... - That's my son. ...half-dead. What then? - [Brad on TV] I saw my wife... - Kate, come. Come sit with us. And I knew I'd be in trouble if I didn't get myself back home... Yeah. Yeah, just give me one sec, okay? ...so I hung in there. Thankfully. [Brad] It's good to see you walking again, man. [man] I'll always be grateful. You know, you saved my life. [Brad] Don't mention it. You would've done the same for me. [knocking] Give me a minute with my old lady. Thanks, man. - Hi, mama bear. - Hiya. Hey. Who are all these people in my house? [chuckles] They are all here for you. You okay? [grunts] I just, um... I don't know if it's necessarily... the right time for me to leave, you know? [sighs] I mean, I... I... I love my job. I just love you more. You gotta trust me here, okay? Okay, but you have to promise me... that if you need me... at all, for any reason... that you tell me. Because I will drop everything, and I will come home. I promise. Don't worry, okay? And besides, I'm not gonna let you drop this so you can, what, give the credit to someone else? - [laughs] - Come on. This is gonna be great, right? [exhales] Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna be good. Yes! Of course! And Morocco's beautiful. You're gonna love it. I know. I've always been so close, but I never got to go. Oh. You're gonna have such a good time. And look, Clair-bear and I, we really need some daddy-daughter time, you know? Yeah. - Get these people out of my house. - [laughs] [football playing on TV] [Brad] The worst game I've ever seen in my life. [announcer] He's in for the score. Oh... Oh, come on! What a bad play, man. [cell phone buzzing] Your mom's calling. [turns off TV] Hey, babe. - How's the trip going? - Good, I, uh... I'm just getting everything unpacked now. But you're right, it's... - it's so beautiful here, it's insane. - I told you. - Hey, Mom. - Hi, Kate! Hey, kiddo! Hey, Ed. How are you guys? What are you guys doin'? We're building an ancient site with Grandpa. - That sounds amazing. - You okay? What's it like over there? It's beautiful. It is... It's something I've never seen before. It's just... Okay, Mom, gotta go. Bye. Love you. [laughs] Oh, she's busy. She's only 11, and she doesn't even care about me anymore. That's not true. She misses you. We all miss you. I miss you too. Are you okay? I'm good. I'll call you before I go to bed, okay? - Okay, do that. - I love you. Love you more. [phone beeps] [bird squawking] [chattering] Miss Paxton. I'm Jean Rashidi. It's such a pleasure to finally meet you. The pleasure is all mine, Mr. Rashidi. - Please. Call me Jean. - Jean. I mean... What a find. This is incredible. Congratulations. Thank you. My colleagues and I haven't had this much excitement in years. We are honored to be part of this. I mean, the feeling is mutual. I can't wait to get out there. - Jean. Mrs. Paxton. - Mr. Achour. Thank you so much for the hospitality. - This is incredible. - It's a pleasure. Let me introduce you to your Moroccan counterpart. This is Amir Jadid. He will be your scout leader. Anything you need, anywhere you want to go. Oh. Thank you. I'm of course at your disposal. Just a phone call away. [chattering in French] - [man] Mrs. Paxton? - Yeah. - Hakim Zaydane. Chief of Police. - Nice to meet you, Chief. Have we, uh, done something wrong already? No, no, of course not. No. I'm here on behalf of my superior, Mr. Younes Laalej. Is he our government liaison? No, no, but you're gonna be meeting her shortly. Mr. Laalej has been serving with your husband, and he asked me to watch over you during the coming week. So please don't hesitate to call me at any time, day or night. - Thank Mr. Laalej in Rabat for me. - I will. - Good luck, madam. - Thank you. [in Arabic] - Mrs. Paxton? - Yeah. Hi. My name is Dina Mansouri. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Shall we go? - Yeah. [whistles] [car engines start] [indistinct chattering] The ancient city should be around here. Okay. All right. Well, obviously, safety is our first priority, but let's get as close as we can so we can establish our parameters and compare them against the sat imagery. Okay. Follow me, guys. [Dina] We are very close to the border. We have to be careful. Okay. Just let me know. [Dina] This is as close as we can get. I think we should go back. Kate, I agree. I think we should start the dig on the other side of the city wall and work our way here. It might take years before we get here, anyway. [speaking Arabic] [replying in Arabic] [yelling] [Kate] What's happening? [speaking Arabic] Hey. What's going on? We're in Algeria. [yelling] [automatic weapons firing] [gunfire continues] What the fuck is going on? - We have to go! - Come on! [Kate shouting] Come on! We have to go! Now! - [gunfire] - [Kate screams] No! No! - No! - [gunshot] - Don't move! Hands up! - Please don't shoot! Please! - Hands up! - Please! Don't! Don't shoot! Please. [breathing heavily] Please don't shoot. [in Arabic] [sobs] We didn't mean to cross the border, okay? - It was an accident. - [in English] Shut up, woman! [chattering] [in Arabic] - [gunfire] - [soldier] Get back to the base and get me some backup! [soldier 2] Fuck! We need backup. We're getting hammered here. [yells] [gasps] [panting] [sighs] [cell phone buzzing] Younes. Brad... I'm afraid I have some bad news. Kate. - She has been abducted. - What? - Just an hour ago. - Where? Daesh. She's in Algeria. Younes, how the fuck could this have happened in less than 24 hours? We had all eyes on them. One of my men was even killed trying to rescue her, as well as her government liaison. Kate was seen taken alive with two others. I'm on the first flight out. Hey, Dad. Hey, baby girl. Are you going to work again? Yes. Okay. But Pop Pop will be here shortly, okay? He'll take care of everything. I'll be back soon. [in Arabic] [man speaks Arabic] [man shouts in Arabic] [man speaks Arabic] Welcome to Algeria. What are you doing here? We didn't mean to cross the border. I am on a dig that is sanctioned by the Moroccan government. I... [man] You are spy! No. No, I am not a spy. I... I am an archaeologist. [cocks weapon] [in Arabic] What's your name? My name is Kate Paxton. Kate Paxton. - And you? - Amir. Speak up! Amir Jadid. [interrogator] Moroccan? [Amir in French] Yes. And you. Jean Rashidi, sir. [laughing] [in Arabic] [in French] [in French] [jet engines roar] [chattering] - Paxton, brother. - Younes. Tell me something about these guys. These people are some fringe group, just recently pledged allegiance to ISIS. We know very little about them. The Moroccan government liaison must have missed the borderline with Algeria. It can easily happen when you walk this river. Then they show up out of nowhere the minute Kate and her team crossed. - Security breach. - Most likely, yes. - Any leads? - The driver. He was driving Kate's vehicle. He's nowhere to be found. [engine starts] [key rattling in lock] [in Arabic] Get in. Put it there. [coughing, gagging] [man in English] What's wrong with you? - [retching] - Are you pregnant? [retches, coughs] Answer my question! [grunts] No. No, I'm not. [panting] [in Arabic] [in English] Eat your food. - I'll watch you. - Hey. Hey, you speak English? I learned from American movies. What's your, uh... What's your favorite movie star? Jackie Chan. [laughs] That's a good choice. He's mine, too. - What's your name? - Uh, my name is Omar. Omar, I'm Kate. It's really nice to meet you. Do you know where my friends are? In other rooms. Are they okay? Yes. For now. [softly] Okay. [retches, coughs] Be quiet. Hey, be quiet. Don't bring attention to you. Okay? I'm gonna bring you some water. [locks door] [birds chirping] The age-old Sahara conflict between Morocco and Algeria is front and center, especially now, with a crucial vote in the UN scheduled for next week. What do we know about the vote and this conflict? For most of us, it's the first we've heard of it. - [phone rings] - Yes? [woman] Mr. Tom Fitzgerald is here to see you, sir. Send him in. [turns off TV] Come in, Fitzy. It's good to see you. Good to see you. Smells good in here. Cubans? - State secret, really. - Uh-huh. Fitzy... that UN vote next week, if it favors Morocco, the American and British oil companies will be able to keep drilling in Moroccan Sahara. And considering what just happened and the fact that it happened in Algerian territory, the majority of the vote is gonna favor Morocco, which in effect will create a... what you might call an epic win for Big Oil. Quite the coincidence? Hmm. Indeed. So, they're here. We should discuss our approach? Our approach. - Would you like a drink? - No, thank you. More for me. You know, when my wife and I transferred here, we were very excited... [pouring] ...once we left Pakistan. We were looking for a quieter, more peaceful place and perhaps some weekends in Marrakech. And instead... we got a different part of the same jungle. Cheers. So, Captain Paxton. He's very concerned. He also works for Globe Security Group. - He's a hostage negotiator. - One of the best. He was responsible for the release of those students in Nigeria, and that was no small feat. We can't have him involved in this, Earl. Under no circumstances. I've read the rule book, Fitzy. Nevertheless, I'm excited to meet him, so... I suggest... I just won't let him in. Hmm? Of course. - Elizabeth. - Sir? Show, uh, Captain Paxton and the others in, please. Yes, sir. - Chief Sekkat. - Ambassador. Ah, Captain Paxton. What an honor it is to meet you, sir. Honor is mine, Ambassador. I'm truly sorry that it's under these terrible circumstances. Thank you, sir. - Younes. - Ambassador. Honor to meet you, Captain. Tom Fitzgerald. - Section chief. - Honor, sir. - Younes. - Fitz. Our government has allowed Captain Paxton to join in. He will be included in all our joint meetings. Sorry, Captain and Younes, but, uh, there's a matter of clearance. I'll have to speak to Washington. Captain Paxton has been granted clearance on our side. Uh, Chief. Ma'am. You know that US government policy does not allow relatives or friends to participate... Mr. Fitzgerald. We expect full cooperation between our governments. Captain Paxton is now a part of our task force. Let's get this briefing going. I agree. Please, have a seat. Well, we know that the hostages are in Algeria, we just don't know where. We also know that the Algerians are as pissed off about this as we are, and I see as a first step that we give 'em the time to get intel on the ground. We all agree negotiation is out of the question. The leader's name is Jaafar El Hadi. He's been on Interpol's radar for a couple of years now. Fitz, brief us. What do we know about him? [sighs] Well, El Hadi is French, of Algerian origins, he's a wealthy businessman. He likes money. He likes his picture in the paper. He was radicalized two years ago, bankrolled two attacks in Paris. He has the means to have a self-sufficient operation, gather followers and buy weapons. We think he's ISIS-inspired. He wants their attention. Captain, thoughts? It's been 24 hours. We have not heard from El Hadi. That is alarming. We need intel on the ground now, sir, and not just from the Algerians. Once we find him, we can extract them. - A rescue mission. - Yes, sir. They were taken to be beheaded. They'll be dead within days. Well, the Algerians are looking, and they're trying to gather the intel that we need, because right now, I must confess, we're operating blind. With all due respect, Mr. Ambassador, sir... besides the Algerians, we have intel superpowers right here at this table. We should be able to find them. We should. Yes, sir. Okay, let's get on it. - Mm-hmm. - Thank you. - Can I get a spoon, please? - Of course. - There you go. - Thanks. There you go. [man on TV] Your local news. [woman on TV] Kate Paxton went to Morocco to study this amazing discovery of human bones dating back over 300,000 years - recently found in Morocco... - Hey, that's Mom! ...and it all happened when her team accidentally crossed the Algerian border. - [turns off TV] - Is she okay? What happened? Of course she is, sweetheart. Give Grandpa a moment, okay? Okay. [reporter on TV] We've just learned that the Islamic State has praised the kidnapping today, citing it as a glorious example of action, and reiterated their call to arms by what they describe as their "global army at large." The United States and Morocco reiterated in separate statements they will not negotiate with terrorists. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! [phone ringing] - Pop. - Son. How's everything going? [sighs] It's going. I know you're probably up to something stupid. Yeah, you know me. - Maybe I should come. - No, Pop, stay with Clair. She really needs you. It's the best you can do. Keep your eyes open, your mind sharp. Bring our Kate home. Okay, son? Yes, sir. [reporter on TV] The Algerian Security Services are on the ground, trying to find the location of the hostages and their captors. - [knock on door] - [El Hadi in French] Get in. [in Arabic] [in French] [in French] [sighs] [in French] [in French] [chattering] [in French] [in French] [all clamoring] [man in Arabic] [in Arabic] [in French] [all shouting] The woman who was killed, Mrs. Mansouri, cleared Kate's driver. She was probably threatened. I don't think she knew anything. We're questioning the family. I need to get into Algeria, and you're gonna help me. Paxton, brother, you're out of your mind. Where will you go? El Hadi must be hiding in a place where the Algerians aren't looking. They'll never find him. They'll kill Kate soon if they haven't already. [cell phone rings] [in Arabic] [in English] We have proof of life. [in Arabic] [in Arabic] [Younes] I am Younes Laalej, Senior Officer of His Majesty's Bureau of Investigations. This is my superior, Chief Sekkat. We are authorized to speak with you. The hostages are alive. Okay, Amir, it is very important that you listen to me now. How long was the drive until they dropped you off? [voice trembling] I don't remember. Uh... Think. Did it feel like ten hours? Or three hours? [Amir] Ten. Did you make any stops along the way? [Amir] Maybe one. Yeah. May... May I speak with my family now? Please. Your family will be waiting for you when you arrive here in Rabat. It is a long drive to get here, Amir. so I want you to take that time and try to think of anything you can remember. [door opens] [in Arabic] Come with us! Please. Please. Please, I... - [in English] Hey! Shh! - Please, I have a daughter. Look at me. Look at me! If you don't shut up, he hits you. Okay? - You understand? - [softly] Yeah. Go! Please... [Kate grunting] [door closes] - No. No. - Get down. Sit! Please, no. Please, I have a daughter. I have a family... [in Arabic] [in Arabic] [muttering] Please. [panting] Please, please, please! [crying, whimpering] Please don't do this. Please don't do this. [cries out] Please. [crying] You didn't have to do that. I would have gone if you had just asked me to. You're a liar. You said to my colleague... you were not pregnant. And here... we don't like lies. Especially from women. I didn't know. [sighs] What do you want from me? I want you to speak to your government... and let them know if they don't pay the ransom, Saturday night after the evening prayer, you and your child are going to die. Can I ask how much I'm worth? Ten million dollars. [sighs] What goes through your mind when you kill a woman and her unborn child? [humorless chuckle] I think of... all the kids, all the women, all the innocent men, that your government has killed. [door closes] Oh, God. [sobbing] [chattering] [Brad sighs] What's happening, Younes? We have yet to debrief him. [Younes] He was dropped off. Or rather, thrown off a pickup truck. Tied up and gagged at a checkpoint near our side of the border. He was instructed to deliver proof of life. My guys drove him to Rabat, and here we are. [Brad] El Hadi wants a show. He wants mainstream video coverage. There's no online videos yet? No, nothing yet. I mean, sending proof of life with a hostage is so old school. It's like a fuckin' movie. [footsteps] They started a livestream. [Jean] It is therefore... we ask our respective governments to pay the sum of $10 million cash for our safe release. Otherwise, we will meet our death this Saturday after the evening prayer. [in Arabic] Speak! [Kate] I would like the US government to consider that if they cause my death... that it is also the death of my unborn child, as I am pregnant. [Fitz sighs] [Brad] The hostage said they drove him less than ten hours to the border. They made one stop along the way, probably to refuel. El Hadi's mother is from Abadla, in Algeria. Small town. Not very populated. Villages all around. How far is that town from the border point where Kate was taken? I'd say at least a seven-hour drive. Close enough. [Issam typing] [Issam] This is how it looks from above. The image may be old. Are there any cell towers in that area, any unusual activity? Nah, nothing unusual. We didn't set up a proper comm surveillance. Can I get a copy of that? Roger that. [in Arabic] [in Arabic] Let's move out. [gunfire, explosions] - [muffled shouting] - [gunfire] [Brad] Fall back, fall back! Fall back, guys! [grunts] [high-pitched whine] [muffled] You all right? [normal volume] Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I want to thank you for looking out for me. Of course. There's not a lot of people I trust around here, you know? [sighs] I really wanted to stay that day back in Syria. Oh, man, don't... Yeah, not now. Ancient history. That mission was doomed from the start. Tell me about it. Don't beat yourself up about it, man. Just part of the job, okay? This one's off the books. [in Arabic] [vehicle approaching] Wait a minute. [in Arabic] [in Arabic] [wind whistling] [fire crackling] I'm going in there with you, Brad. That was not the deal. I owe you my life. I prefer to keep it that way. You will never make it alone. You need me. [no audible dialogue] [whimpering] [gasps] Are you all right? Can you handle what's coming? [exhales] I love this woman more than anything in this world. I'll do whatever it takes. [call to prayer broadcasting over loudspeaker] [call to prayer repeats] [imam] Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar. [all] Allahu Akbar. [imam recites prayers in Arabic] [continues prayer] [man] Hey! [in Arabic] [in Arabic] [in Arabic] [in Arabic] [in English] Why do you tell me this? What do you want from me? [in English] El Hadi is demanding a $10 million ransom to release some hostages. We don't think he needs all of that money. His army's not big enough. There are brothers all around the world that can use some of that. [in English] We want to negotiate with him... I have nothing to do with this. Who are you? I am brother Abdur Raheem Williams from Detroit, Michigan. How come I've never heard about a brother from Detroit? I've traveled all around the world in the name of our cause, but in America, we operate quietly, as we must. Who sent you? The less you know, the better. I'll make sure you and your people are compensated for your assistance. We need to send El Hadi a message of our arrival, and we'd appreciate transportation to get there. Come with me, please. I'm not helping you because you say that you're Abdur Raheem Williams. I'll help you because God gave you the gift to make the difference... between the good and the bad. [in Arabic] [in English] You have our gratitude. Your help will always be remembered. Please, um... Please accept this for the mosque. For the car, at least. Mr. Williams... be careful. Those people have nothing to do with Islam. I may very well be sending you to your death. My cause is worthy of my death. [Younes] It should be behind that tree. [Brad] Got it! You were right. About what? You don't need me. You can do just fine on your own. Well, we're not there yet. We're being followed. Or escorted. We should have no trouble finding El Hadi now. - How do you figure? - Despite what the imam says, those men must work for El Hadi. I'm sure they're trying to give him a heads-up that we're on our way. Once we get to Abadla, let's lose 'em... then we follow them. Well, hello, hello, hello. - That was almost too easy. - Yeah. Thanks for the escort, guys. Let's get this party started. [spews coffee] [President] Earl, I know I'm stating the obvious, but we have exactly two hours... two hours before the execution of a pregnant, innocent American woman and a French citizen. [Secretary of State] We have not been able to get the Algerians to agree to anything. They want our support in the UN vote, but we cannot allow... Madam Secretary. Please. I don't mean to interrupt, but the gentleman that we are dealing with is batshit crazy. All he wants is for the US to be on its knees and to get ISIS cred. And he has both, so I suggest that we send in the SEALs immediately. Uh, well, I'd give you 90% probability the Algerians would try to stop us. Of course they will. Mr. President, we're nowhere near ready for a Title 50 operation. - We don't have the intel. - Yes, we do. [silenced gunfire] [grunts] Rogue assets? Who are they? What are they doing? One of Morocco's top secret agents and one of our own have entered Algerian territory to rescue the hostages. One of our own? Who? Captain Brad Paxton. [President] Captain Paxton? The marine. Yes. Kate Paxton is his wife. Do we know where they are? [Williams] They have located the terrorist compound. And how do we know this? They're communicating with Moroccan authorities. [man] Mr. President, there's not enough time here for any kind of military response... Find out. Bring me all tactical options. What do we got? I'd say 300 meters. We need all four in four shots. Can you make it? I've been practicing on the weekends. Clear. [chattering in Arabic] [gunshots] [man] Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar! - [whipping] - [man groaning] - [gunfire] - Keep your head down! Hey. Come on. Stay with me! Don't die on me! [gunfire, shouting] [gunshots] Are you okay? [in Arabic] - [shouts in Arabic] - Okay, okay. - [shouts] - Don't shoot. I shoot. Take me to the American woman. [in Arabic] She's here. [distant gunfire] [Kate crying] - Hey. - [Kate] Get off me! Please, stop! - Get off me! Get off me! - It's me. It's me. I got you. It's me. It's okay. - Oh, my God! - It's okay. - You came. - Did they hurt you? No. - Can you walk? - Yeah. - Yeah, I can walk. - All right. You remember how to use this? Yeah. That's my girl. Look at me, all right? We're gonna get out of here. We're going home. - Yeah. - Stay right behind me. - Okay? - Yeah. [distant gunfire] [soldier screams] [panting] It's okay. It's okay. All right now. All right now. Stay with me. Stay with me. Okay? Okay. You got this. Yeah. Yeah. I need you to stay in this room. I need you to stay quiet. - Yeah. - I will be back for you. - Okay. - [kisses] - [gasping] - Sorry. Please. Don't shoot. Please. Go. Go. [distant gunfire] [in French] [in French] [in French] - [footsteps] - [door thrown open] [in Arabic] [groaning] [in French] [man speaks French] [Jean retches] [Jean groaning] [moans] Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Mr. Jean Rashidi in Paris. This is a heartbreaking day. There is evil in this world. But when we look it in the eye, when there's a knife to our throats, we must remember our own goodness and that of those who have come before us. We must not, and we will not, give up on our humanity. - [reporters clamoring] - [woman] Mr. President, how do you feel about a pregnant American woman being executed in two hours? Ladies and gentlemen, we are doing everything we can to work every diplomatic channel known to us to save the lives of Mrs. Paxton and her unborn child. That is all I can say at this time. God bless the United States of America, and God bless us all. [reporter] Oil exports from Afghanistan... Looks like we're going in for a rescue. How do you figure that? I know my president. Well, that's highly risky. Not enough time. You don't have any real recon, no real intel... We got what we need from the Moroccans. You need to get up to speed. You kept me out of that loop. That I did. - [knock on door] - [woman] Excuse me. The Algerian ambassador is here waiting to see you. [Williams] Thank you. The diplomacy clusterfuck continues. Fitzy... we are buying time, but you need to make sure that Kate Paxton gets home safe. I'll do my best. Ah, Ambassador, welcome. [line ringing] [man] Sir? [Fitz] Send the SEALs. Shoot to kill, and get Kate Paxton out of there. Yes, sir. [in French] Take me to El Hadi. [Brad in Arabic] [in Arabic] [in English] Better than yours. [grunts] [in English] If you shoot me, he will shoot you... and we all die together. Is that what you want? You want $10 million. We're here to negotiate that for you. Then why are you here, killing my men? Who are you? I'm Captain Brad Paxton. Kate is my wife. We know you have a bank account in Panama. We also know the code. It can be transferred in a second. Then do it! [Issam typing] [in Arabic] [in Arabic] - [sighs] - [laughs] Done. [typing] [beeping] Jaafar. [in French] [gun clicks] - [helicopter whirring] - Go! Go! Go! [soldier screams] [groans] [grunting] - [cracking] - [groans] [grunting] [panting, groaning] [distant gunfire] [SEAL] Go, go, go! Go, you guys, move! [shouting continues] [SEAL] Captain Paxton? - Yeah. - Captain Brody. What do you say we get you and your family home? Damn skippy, Captain. Let's go. [gunfire] [distant shouting] [Brad] Kate, baby, our ride is here. Let's go, let's go, let's go! - [machine gun burst] - [Brad grunts] - [Brody] Watch your flank! - [Brad] Go! - [Kate screams] - [Brad] Go, go, go! I'm right behind you! - [Kate] Brad! - Take her and go! - [Brody] Go, go, go, go! - Brad! [gunfire continues] [groaning] [grunts, groans] [gunshots] Thanks. Okay, let's go. - Let's go. - Okay. [helicopter whirring] - Brad! Brad! - Come on! - [Kate] Brad! - [Brody] Go, go, go! Brad! Brad! No! [sobbing] No... [in Arabic] [Hajji in Arabic over radio] Katherine! Brad! [chattering] [knock on door] - Good to see you, Amir. - Mr. Fitz. Mr. Jadid. Can I offer you some tea? - No, thank you. - Have a seat. [sighs] I was not supposed to be taken. That was not the deal. You were never in any danger. And you handled it very well, Amir, very well. Your rookie fear notwithstanding. You're now an American citizen and a CIA asset. You should be very, very proud. Thank you. [silenced gunshots on phone] I do love seeing good old-fashioned CIA work in action. There's nothin' like it. Two SEALs died last night. Cost of American freedom. Mm-hmm. [Fitz] The ambassador. What about him? They suspect something. The Moroccans do too. There are matters... kings, presidents... and ambassadors better not... know. Let's make sure of that.
