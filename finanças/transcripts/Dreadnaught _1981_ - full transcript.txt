Someone just raided the bank. Mousy went and fought them. He was outnumbered. What's happened? He was badly beaten up. Where were the police? They've all disappeared. Mousy is righteous. Take him as your student, please. Mousy! He can't even stand straight. I'll treat you in a special way. What special way? You've got your heart in the wrong place. I must open your chest and put it right. Then I'll sew up your chest. Then you'll be okay. He can stand it. Master Huang, this knife alright? Just about. Ah Foon! Hold him down! I'm fine! I'm okay. Mousy... Ah Foon! Drink to the Marshal! I'm generous. I don't bear grudges. I thought you're really clever. Master Huang. Stop drinking. You're on duty now! Master Huang, see you later. Goodbye! Goodbye! So long... White Tiger! Give yourself up! We'll get you! There's no escape! Be careful! You just scared me to death! I wouldn't mind going to the toilet myself. Yes, me, too. - Let's go over that side. - Good. Let's do it here. Having a pee? Nonsense! I feel very sorry to the two of you. When you see Master Huang, ask him not to be angry with me, please. - Certainly... - Not! ''Having a pee is not allowed.'' I can piss anywhere cause I'm a cop. Don't watch me piss! Stop it! Mousy! The two bounty hunters are dead. - Are you sure? - Of course. - Where are they? - Over there! It was the masked killer! The masked killer? He must be connected with the opera troupe. You don't have to tell me. Just let me know if I can be of service. No thanks. You're not the Marshal. I can easily handle this. I've got all the masked opera singers here! But who is the murderer? Shut up! Speak up! Who's the murderer? Speak. You've got the wrong person! I've got to go! Cross-eye! Yes, Marshal! Have you got all the masked opera singers? Every single one of them.

They're all crooks! The murderer is connected with the opera troupe. Keep your eyes open for me. Yes? There's a newcomer who acts strangely... Mr. Chiu, it's your turn. I'm coming! See me after the show. I'll tell you more. I hate Huang, and Huang's suspicious of you. Let's cooperate. I'll send you out of the country afterward. They'll never get you. But you may not be able to take Huang single-handed. - Mayor! - Congratulations! Thanks for coming. Have a seat please! Have a few more drinks, Marshal. I'll get myself drunk alright. I've got to see Chiu at the theatre. - I'll come along. - Stay here! Ah Foon, but... But what? You think I'll die? What are we? - Friends. - Right. Take revenge if I die. What are you doing?
