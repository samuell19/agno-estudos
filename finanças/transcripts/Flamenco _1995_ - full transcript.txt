Flamenco surfaced in Andalucia in the middle of the 19th century. The mixture of people, religions and cultures created a new type of music. Greek rattles, Mozarab jarchas... Gregorian chants, Castillian romances and Jewish laments... the sound of blackness and of the gypsy settlers from distant India... all blended to create the musical structure we now call Flamenco. And it is expressed through song, dance and the guitar.
