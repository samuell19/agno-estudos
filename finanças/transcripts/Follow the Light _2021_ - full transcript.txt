I wish a meteor would come and destroy Earth. Return the balls after using them. Two were left out earlier today. Non-compliance will result in bans. That's all for today. Stand. Bow. Goodbye Miss. Thanks for everything. I'll stay in touch. We will, too. Come visit sometime. Good luck. Thanks again. See you. - I'll be in touch. - Promise. No after-school club activities? I'm not interested. Really? Bye. Goodbye. Why is he always so gloomy. That's Nakajima, right? Maybe he can help us. It's the closing ceremony. Our final school festival. He's new here, anyway. 38 days until the school closing ceremony If it's not growing rice, it's not worth much. Fallow fields don't sell well. That's for sure. Maki! Time to go home. Akira, dinner's ready. At least acknowledge her. Ryota! That's enough. Let's eat now. Before it gets cold. Okay. I'm working. You went to Tokyo to seek success, but came back with nothing. It's always the same with you. You're pathetic. You can't stick anything out. If your dad were alive, he'd be furious. Gimme a break. Akira, look at this. Ways to use the school once it's shut down. Like maybe as a music video location. You know, people singing along, having fun. Good idea. Give me some real feedback. It's not my school. It is while we're here. How's school anyway, Akira? Nothing special. Way slower than Tokyo, right? But academically, it tests very high. Didn't do me much good, though. All you cared about was music. But you'll fit in well here. You'll be fine. Do you miss Tokyo so much? Don't rub it in, Mom. Right? I'm done. Hey. Maybe he likes hamburger? Don't bother. He's not a kid. But he barely ate anything. No big deal. Application for Divorce Signed Koyuki Nakajima Pick up, damnit! Hitoshi Izumiya. Arata Ueda. Noriko Ezaki. Maki Okamoto. Isn't that good? It is. You're drawing Maki? Maki Okamoto, right? That's her uncle's place. She's always there, up on her uncle's roof. That chick is roof crazy. She's nuts, don't get involved. Shota finally found a friend? Well done! Congratulations. Good job. Congrats. What's this? He's good. Hey, hands off. Cut it out. Great drawing. So talented. Isn't that Maki's picture? We're having a school closing festival. We're organizing it. Can you help out? We were thinking of a big mural on the wall. Him? He's only just got here. What kind of picture? Like this. What is it? It's an eagle. It's the symbol of the school, the whole town, actually. That's pretty good. He can do it. Can you help us out, please? I'll try. Really? That's great! Yeah, maybe. Okay, but make sure you do it properly. Just an eagle is boring, any ideas? Something that'll blow everyone away. Okay, I'll think about it. Great. Thanks for that. Used Farm Machinery Combine-Harvester Once you're done harvesting, I'll pick it up. Good man. As for payment. Here's the deposit. Thanks. I also need... ...you to find a buyer for my rice fields. Are you seriously ill, or something, Hideo? Why ask? You're selling off your machinery and your land. So either you've won the lottery, or you're on your deathbed. To help your sister? It's complicated. Anyway, keep looking. Got it. Leave it to me. You've lost weight, are you eating properly? I'm cooking now. My fried rice is spectacular. Well, it's been a year now. You've had to change since your wife passed. I'll cook you dinner sometime. Bye. Did you hear? Ryota's back. How come? His wife left him. He's back with his boy. Life can be tough, eh? Who's that? Who threw it? A boy, obviously. I bet they're Tamura's. Absolutely. Anyone seen my trousers? Job-Seeker's Website Miss. These were thrown into our locker room. Probably Tamura's. Picking on Tamura again? I'll take care of this. That's the third time he's been bullied. Excuse me. Tamura, again? How's he taking it? Fine. So far, so good. "So far," yeah right. Maki Okamoto is in your class, isn't she? Yes, I do an occasional home visit. When was the last time? Excuse me. They're mine, Miss. I'm off to the fire station, you need a ride home? What's this, Uncle? Give it to your mom. She's a hopeless teacher. Right. She gets on my nerves. She's got no motivation. I can't stand her. I totally get that. What'll they do to the school? Probably just demolish it. Seriously? That saves paying to maintain it. You found your trousers? Yeah, I got them back. Good. Hey listen. You want one? From Tokyo? You can buy 'em anywhere. Yeah, obviously. Beautiful, isn't it? Not like Tokyo, just miles of rice paddies. This is the best season of all. A mural? You're too slow. Get ready for some real speed. You're too fast. Can't keep up? Give your mom my love. It looks like a rose and it's delicious. It's that good? All done. Here you go. You'll love it. Looks amazing. It is. Well? - Delicious! - I told you. What's baba-hera mean? Because "baba" do make it with a "hera," laddie. That's me own special baba-hera. See "baba," meaning grandma, serves it with a "hera," a spatula. That be it, lad. She says "That's right." It was great, wasn't it? Try a different one next time. Yeah, sure. This is a shortcut. Takes less time. Is that a satellite? It's gone. Hey! Look it's back. You lack any urgency. Sorry, I'll go splash my face. Sure, good idea. It's gone. I'm relieved. I'm glad it's gone. Keep going? Seriously? Hideo? What's wrong? Fire brigade speaking. Okay, just calm down. UFO Green light Which direction was that? Can I get your name? Mr Ito? Did you see where it went? Wait up. Hey, wait. Don't do it. I mean it. What are you filming? Be careful, it could be dangerous. Don't do it. Come on! Tell no one. Never tell anyone about this. Did you make this circle? Promise me. What the hell is this? What's it for? This is amazing! Tell anyone, and I'll kill you. Follow the Light Akira, dinner's ready. Sorry, I'll pay the interest by the weekend. Pay it all by the weekend, or you're out of business. You've let it go too long. I'm very sorry. I'm really sorry. But can't you give me more time? What the hell? You're spilling it. I'm so sorry. No need to pay. - Sorry. - This is ridiculous. I'm so sorry. Please, one more chance. Sorry. You startled me. No one was home, I guessed you'd be here. I'm so glad to catch up with you. Do you see yourself coming back to school? Why not try it just for a day? It's closing down soon. They'd all love to see you. Who's "they?" Everyone. But specifically, who? Name one. The entire class, obviously. I brought the printouts and stuff that you've missed. Don't want them. Okay, I'll hang onto them for you. I'd better get going. But I'm glad to see you. Quite relieved, actually. All's good. Running away, are you? Don't bother coming back. Listen. What? Did you see the UFO? Was it a UFO? Numerous sightings reported That's awesome! So many sightings. It's not a hoax. Is that a real photo? Got a minute? How about this? Wow, that looks great! The eagle is a mosaic of photos of all the students. Inspired by a crop-circle thing. Morning class. Miss, did you see the UFO? I don't believe in such things. Boring! Back to your seats. The closing ceremony is approaching. Murakami, any updates for us? Listen up, everyone. Shut up! Nakajima has had a good idea. Tell them, Nakajima. Me? A mural of an eagle on the gymnasium wall. Made up of portraits of students. What's that mean? I don't get it. It's called a mosaic. From afar, it's a giant eagle. Up close, they're portraits. Okay. The eagle is within a big circle. Using rice straw to create a spiral. Rice straw? Is that symbolic? But why a spiral? It's a crop-circle. But why a crop-circle? Is it connected to that UFO? That's great. I'm into UFOs. It's more of a symbol. Isn't it? A crop circle is... an inspiration for the future. Looking to the future, as we say goodbye to our school. Hang on! Nakajima does the portraits, right? I can't draw. Me neither. He should draw them all. - It's his idea. - I agree. Better than my scribblings. Listen. Everyone has to sketch their own face. That's what's important. That's what makes memories. It's okay for you, you're good at drawing. - You're the school genius. - That's enough. I'll do it. I'll do everyone's portrait. Yeah, that's a better idea. Can you do it? Yes, I like drawing. Really? Okay, good. Then I'll leave it to you. Miss! Drop by the staff room later, we've got class photos. Okay, time for rollcall. Thanks for all your help. Sorry I'm late. No, thanks for coming. This is Mr Nakajima, from the town office. He's Akira's dad, in Ms Nara's class. Akira speaks well of you. It was my school, too. Is that right? I'm counting on you, Mr Nakajima. You left town, so you have fresh ideas. He can put things into perspective for us. You did college in Tokyo, right Ms Nara? Why come back? No particular reason. Her dad's the school superintendent. Right. That's how she got the job. Is your dad just as strict at home, too? Yes, I guess he is. I think she's great. We're lucky to have her on staff. Continue working hard to raise good, local students. We need you. Thanks. She's headed to Tokyo. Always checking online job sites, right? She's obviously not happy here. Go back to Tokyo. Find another job. Okay, now it all makes sense. Oh, by the way. For the school closing ceremony, how about we sing a song? A song, eh? I've written one. It'll be fun if we all sing it together on the day. That's a great idea! Once a musician, always a musician. Then sing it for us. Okay, just the first verse. The great eagle carries our happiness aloft Our school may be closing But the glow will always remain Cut it out! It's not closing, you guys made it redundant. We're losing our school. You town officials are useless, people keep leaving. It's nothing to sing sappy songs about. Sorry. You're supposed to encourage agriculture, not sing at the closing ceremony. Farms go to ruin, people leave town. Perhaps it's time we made a toast? What have you ever done for the town? What do you mean? I didn't see you doing anything to improve matters. Blame the town and prefectural officials. That's all you do. Aren't we teachers also to blame? They're closing it down. Nothing we do changes that. But still... I want them to have a successful closing ceremony. The kids are putting their hearts and souls into it. Don't they deserve our full support? Even if the school is lost, I want them to treasure its memory. To be proud of their school. Yes, he's right. Right, let's have a toast. Come to the after-party. Let's all go together. I'll head home. I really should, too. Okay, I'll walk you part of the way. I actually liked your song. Thank you. Any regrets about coming back here? I'd be lying if I said no. I failed to make it in Tokyo. They didn't like my song. I took this job to improve the town, but what have I accomplished? I really wanted to stay in Tokyo. But my parents made me come back. They wanted me to be a teacher here. To dedicate my life to developing my students' potential. I think that's a noble cause. Going Out of Business I was starting to hate this place. But lately, I'm not so sure about that anymore. I hated being here. That's why I left. But I never managed to achieve anything. Farmland Abandonment Countermeasures I'm off. See you. Take care. Hey pal! What? I'll show you around town. There's this massive park, with over 2000 cherry trees. But not in bloom now, right? - No. - Maybe some other time. Where are you going? Just out. Where? To see Okamoto? To sketch her. We saw her. Plus you have the photos. She's really weird. Stay away from her. She attacked Murakami. She gave her 10 stitches. Ten stitches? Is that true? Maybe it is. You don't know her. She's crazy, she goes wild. She could kill you. I'll go anyway. I'm serious. She's dangerous. Don't blame me! Okamoto. Okamoto? Hi there! Hello? I fell asleep. It feels good. What's that? Show me. You saw it, didn't you? The green light. Stand up. Spread your arms wide. Look up at the sky. Close your eyes. - Pray. - Pray for what? To summon the UFO. - What? - Just do it. But what if it appears? Then we get onboard. Together. Wherever it takes us. Are you serious? Close your eyes. Okamoto? Hey, Okamoto. When it appeared, it led me here. Same with you, right Akira? You think I'm crazy. Look. I believe in aliens. You're crazy, too. Let's go. Hurry up. Come on. - I'm standing. - That's dangerous. Try to keep going straight. Make sure you pray properly. It's a powerful god. Ten yen's not enough. - How much? - 100 yen. - But that was ten. - Quick! Let's ring it together. Now pray. Too slow. Okay, I'll speed up. Hold on tight. No need. You'll fall off, hold on. - I'm fine. - Okay, I'll go faster. Don't do that. 100,000 yen per 1/4 acre? ($955) We have 8 rice fields, 2 acres. Total rice yield earns barely 800,000 yen a year. ($7,650) She a truant, that girl. Truant from school? Her dad owns the gas station. Very violent. She attacked a classmate. Didn't she? That's what happens when a family gets in debt. Come on up. Hurry it up. Are you scared? Not really. Grab a hold. You are scared. No, I'm not. Don't. Can you stand? Of course. In the mornings As you set out Every mountain you see Is shrouded in fog Never was there a mountain with no fog Look around and see Every mountain is blanketed in fog Great voice. My mom's so much better. She teaches folk music. When I was little, the whole family sang together. Mom would start singing, Dad would join in. But he couldn't sing, so Mom told him off. That never stopped him, though. But neither of them sing anymore. No! Stop it! Fool! Out the way. It's Maki's. This is Maki's. Did you do that? UFO Green light He's enjoying it. She says hello. This is the reality of food. You need to watch. Grilled smashed rice? Yes, and when cut, it makes great dumplings. It smells fantastic. - They're done. - Good. Let me see. How's this? They be right proper. What'd he say? That means looking good. This yellow fat is the best part. It looks good. Maki, go pick some parsley. Put them down. Let's go. Won't be long. Hideo asked me over. Good day. Hello. Sorry, I didn't get a chance earlier. I've brought some saké. Good man. You can go get the parsley. Here. Shall I show him? Off you go. See you. This area never changes. It's over here. Bring it over. This one. It's Japanese parsley. That weed? Is it edible? Can't have chicken dumpling stew without it. How do you know? Your grandma taught me how and where to find it. Smell it. Fresh. Great smell, right? The roots are the best part. Around here, it still grows wild. That's enough, Akira. There's plenty more. Only pick what we can eat. Come on, that's the last one. Pass it over. Let's eat. Go ahead. Please. Thank you. Too hot for you? It tastes great. That's the chicken fat. Whenever we have this, you say that. You noticed that, too? He does. That is delicious! You're a good cook, Hideo. - Flattery. - But it's true. It tastes just like when I was a little kid. We used his shed for band rehearsals, he'd cook this for us. Pity you couldn't play. Don't say that. Couldn't tell if they were singing or barking. We were singing. No one was barking. I guess I really do love this place. It's all changing, though. But some things shouldn't have to change. Am I right? He's tipsy. He's just getting started. Don't pull faces. You like this? Maki, you can stay the night. I'll call your mom. I'll do it now. Make the call. Got to make the call. This is perfect. I'm just going out. - Where? - Don't worry. Okamoto Gas Station Notice of Foreclosure C'mon, smile. You listening? Those idiots. Sorry, Brother. Take care of Maki for us Damn them! Damn them! - Are you okay? - Don't! Come back. Cut it out. Damn them! - Damn them! - Maki. Let's go get that ice cream again. Come on. Maki Okamoto It's looking good. It's definitely taking shape. I've arranged an empty classroom for you to use. It'll be easier if they're up on a wall. Let's do it. For as long as you want. Who's organizing the rice straw? We haven't decided. I'll bring some from my grandma's place. Really? That's great! Check this out. It's like a photo. A very good likeness. Fantastic. This must be you, right? It's coming together. This is definitely you. - No way! - It's so realistic. Chief. Can we talk? My summary on re-purposing abandoned land. Already? That was quick. Commercial flower-growing. That makes sense. Good report. Thank you, sir. Washiya Junior High Closing Ceremony 10 days until the school closing ceremony - A little more. - Higher? Okay. That's good. No too much overlap. Adjust the spacing as you go. Good. That looks great. What? Maki? May I? Excuse me! Hey! You on the roof! You hear me? Where's Ebigasawa? What do you know about the crop circles? Maybe she doesn't know. Based on this, it's somewhere nearby. In this area. Crop circle in Ebigasawa! Posted by Akira Nakajima It could be anywhere. Maki! It's your decision. You're one of us now. But... she isn't. I don't believe this. You discovered this, Nakajima? - Your post is going viral. - Really? Look. Akira Nakajima's account. Look at this. Is this real? Where was this taken? No idea. But you posted it, didn't you? You made the circle? No. It was just there. That's bizarre. Akira and I saw the UFO. It was a green light, it flew in a zigzag. We followed it and found the crop circle. Seriously. It's true. Show them the alien video. - Fake. - Show them. Then I will. Check this out. - Nothing there. - It's coming up. Who's that? Maki? It is, it's Maki. She's totally crazy. Insane. She almost killed me. She tried to strangle me. It's true. She's nuts. - Where? - It's quite close. Let's go look. Under that blue tarp. It's a crop circle. A real one. Give it back. No! Cut it out! Give it back. Don't. Cool. Take some pictures. Start live-streaming. Stop that! Akira Nakajima Alien caught on camera! You made a fake account? How could you? - That sucks. - He's gone too far. It's not funny. What did I do to you? What did I do wrong? Now everyone knows Maki's secret. All you talk about is Maki! Why can't I be you friend? Why don't I have friends? At least one of you could be my friend. Oh no! Maki. I'll get the teacher. So here you are, Akira. Classmates only, sorry. - No outsiders. - I'm no outsider. Why, Akira? It wasn't me. Seriously? It wasn't me. Did you draw all these? Impressive. Why is mine here? This is wrong. I've never once smiled here. No school, no family. I wish the Earth would disappear, too. Are you serious? It's you who should disappear. When you're not here, we have fun. Look, everyone's smiling. What's going on? Stop that! It doesn't concern you. Stop it! Stop doing that. Stop it. It's all your fault. Look what you've done to me. It's all your doing. You did this. You ruined something precious to me. It's your fault, Akira. All because of you. No, Tamura set up a fake account. Don't you care that we're losing our school? I do. And I hate it. Every year we lose more students. Until the school has to close. I can't stop that. All I can do is make the closing ceremony a success. That's all I want. It's the last thing we all do together. This school is finished. I just want to walk away with a smile. Is that wrong? Listen. After the closing ceremony... My family's moving out. No way. You too? What the hell for? I don't know. So we all just go our separate ways. Everyone's leaving? No. I can't accept that. Don't run away. We all want to run. But still... We're holding on. I refuse to run away. I don't want to. You too... You need to stay. No way! You believe in aliens? Summon the UFO with prayers. This is our last chance to be together. Everyone wants to run away. Can't I have one friend? Crop circles are an inspiration for the future. Promise me. As we bid our school farewell, we look to the future. I think we can still salvage something from this. Maybe instead of the portraits, let's draw a big eagle. If we do that, we can still make it. Let's all just do what we can. Miss. I can re-draw the portraits again. I don't think we have time for that. I can make one, too. I'll draw it myself. I'll draw my own portrait. That'll work. Everyone needs to do their own portrait. Then we'll make it in time. That was the original plan, anyway. Shota. You'll do one too. I insist. We all have to. Do it. Thanks. Me, too. I'll draw me. Okay, let's start now. Maybe I should do one, too? Is that okay? Right, but before that... Let's get this all cleaned up. Come on. What a mess! There's crap everywhere. Another rampage, I hear. We need to harvest this rice. Rice is for eating, not for looking at. And anyway... It's ours, not the aliens'. Right? Here we go! Hey, Hideo! Sorry I'm late. Too bloody late! Start stacking those bags in the back. Thank you. Thank you. So growing flowers, eh? That's right. Put greenhouses on fallow fields and grow them hydroponically. Then you can have income all year round. Unlike rice-growing, there's no downtime. I can't afford to do this. Loans and subsidies will be available. All these years, I've only ever grown and harvested rice. There'll be setbacks, no doubt about that. We all know it won't be easy. But still... What? Someone has to take the lead. I was born here, my roots are here. One thing, Ryota. It's lucky for us you have no musical talent. Come on, Hideo. Don't rub it in. Flowers, eh? I still don't really get it. But I'll give it a go. Good! He's changed. Good. CLOSED No Entry Okay. It's time to leave. Dear Maki, We've got a place in Akita City. Dad and I are working hard and saving money. Soon we'll be together again.
