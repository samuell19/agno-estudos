I'm digging it, you know Grimaldi, and it's ringing right in the back of my mind, like a bell. It's the telephone. Homicide. There's a link, there's a connection between all these horrible murders. Lieutenant, lieutenant, the commissioner for you. Yes, sir. You're no more upset than we are, sir. They were more than just coworkers, they were close friends. And I expect we'll be on overtime for quite a while. Yes sir, any new developments, you'll hear. Package for you, lieutenant. Damn, Perkins. Get that over to the morgue. Have examination go over it with a fine tooth comb. Come on Duke, move! That's it, the Corey case. Wait a minute, lieutenant. You don't mean the time that half dead guy was brought back to life and slaughtered all those people? Right. And that strange Dr. Vanard was responsible for the whole thing. Get the file on him. Let's see what we've got. Come on. Come on, Grimaldi. Oh yeah, you're right, sir. Here it is. Dr. Howard Vanard. That's it, that's it! Yeah but lieutenant, he's deceased. I know that, I know that. Now what's it say about Perkins? Corey, Joe Corey was the young soldier. And office Perkins was the patrol officer who went after him when he broke away. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There was something in the papers, something about a guy who ah... Right, you were on special detail for the governor. That's right, lieutenant. It's right here. Not only Perkins, but four of my men. Four murders at the hands of some God knows what, and I wanna know why. Why don't you fill me in, lieutenant. A young soldier, fresh from Vietnam, Joe Corey. Shell fragment lodged in his brain. Dr. Vanard operates, something goes wrong. It all began like a routine jewel robbery. What do you want? Now shut up, or you're gonna get hurt. Come on, let's go. So long, baby. Halt! Halt, I said! Joe, help me, Joe. Joe, help me please, Joe. Don't sho... Hurry, up the stairs. We'll go over the roof. We'll go down the other side. All right, Trams didn't make it. Let's go, Curtis. Oh, hello. Hello. Is there anything I can do for you? You've done a whole lot for me already. Well I'm sorry, but the doctor's working hours are over. And besides, you must have an appointment. Oh? Well, let's arrange one, shall we? All right. Now ah, let's see. How about ah, tomorrow night. I could pick you up for dinner around seven, hm? Sorry, I don't go out with married men. You mean it shows? Married men are always the pushiest. Oh, you really know how to hurt a guy, don't ya? Oh well, ah, you wanna tell the good doctor that I'm here? Sergeant Frank Ward, urgent police matter. Dr. Vanard. Dr. Vanard, there's a Sergeant Frank Ward out here to see you. Oh? All right, send him in. It's right through that door. Thank you, sweetheart. Good evening, Sergeant. Dr. Vanard. Well, what's this all about? Have I overlooked some parking tickets? Oh no, nothing, nothing like that, doctor. Well briefly, a man was killed in a robbery today and when we searched his apartment, well, we discovered some rather strange fingerprints. The FBI checked them and discovered they belonged to a man who's been dead for two years. Hm, that's odd, isn't it? But how does this concern me? Well, his name was Joseph Corey. Ring a bell, doctor? Not offhand, should it? You signed the death certificate. He was a patient of yours. Oh? Corey, Corey. Yes I think, just a moment. Oh yes, Corey. Now I remember, Joseph Corey. He died during an operation. He was one of the first casualties of the war in Vietnam. Are you sure that's all you can tell me, doctor? Now see here, Sergeant. Just what is it you expect me to say? I told you he was dead, isn't that enough? Of course, of course, doctor. But, well you can see the implications, can't you? We seem to have a walking dead man on our hands. Now you must admit, that's a bit puzzling. Well, if you happen to think of anything else that might be useful, you will call me, won't you? Certainly. Goodnight, doctor. It cost me 20 bucks, but I got it all. The guy's name's Clark, Dave Clarke. Found that the truck's checked out to him. Address? I got it. Is this the guy? Yeah, that's him. David Jordan Clarke? Yeah, so what? Nick, check the car. Bring him here. I wanna talk to you Mr. Clarke, that all right with you? So talk. It seems as though a half a million dollars in jewels that belongs to me, accidentally fell into the back of your truck. Return the jewels, we'll be on our way, and nobody'll get hurt. The robbery. Yeah, the robbery. Somebody's catching on. Jewels? The back of my truck? Oh, you're outta your mind. As a matter of fact Mr. Clarke, I'm a very sane man. We've searched your house and the truck. Impatient might be a better word. Let me have him, Vito. I'll ask him one more time. The jewels, Clarke. Look I told ya, I don't have any jewels. Joe. Choose you weapons, Clarke. Oh, Clarke. What the matter, Clarke? Does that hurt, huh? Did that hurt, huh? Did it, really? Come on Clarke, you can take it, huh? All right Joe, come here. Get a load of that. Yeah, yeah, it's the marina over across town. Why? You've got a wife named Linda? Yeah, so what? The clubs not closed yet. All right, check the Mrs. out, Joe. Look she doesn't know anything... Make it snappy. Hello again, doctor. Sergeant, I want to apologize to you for getting you out of bed. That's, that's quite all right doctor, I'm sure it's important. You've thought of something else in connection with Joe Corey? You knew, of course, that I was hiding something from you. Yes, yes I did. I have a strange story to tell you, Sergeant. My God, I don't know how to begin. But I, I can't bear to keep it to myself any longer. Perhaps I should tell you something of myself and my work. As you know, I'm head of the neurosurgeon department of this hospital. The functions of the human brain have always fascinated me. 25 years ago I became interested in the rehabilitation of damaged brain areas. It's common scientific knowledge that when an area of the brain is damaged, another area can be retrained to take over the functions of the injured area. In cases of very severe brain damage, this is impossible. The affected person is doomed to live out his days in a virtual catatonic state, unable to move or think of his own volition. Not alive really, existing. To this problem, I dedicated myself. The salvage of, apparently, destroyed lives. I worked for many years. And finally, I designed and built an electronic, artificial brain component, if you like. It's purpose was to take over the functions of the damaged area. Get it's working power from the brain's own electrical impulses. I was desperate to try it. Perhaps, too desperate. Two and a half years ago, Joe Corey was sent to me. He'd been hit by shrapnel while serving in Vietnam, suffered severe brain damage. It was obvious to me at once, he was little more than a custodial case. He could be kept alive with intravenous feeding, but he'd be little more than a human vegetable. He had no family ties, no one to ask permission of. There was no point in asking the medical authorities, I knew what their reaction would be. But I had to test it Sergeant, I had to test it, I had too. I operated on Joe Corey, and I planted the device within his skull. Only one step remained, the activating of the artificial component within Corey's brain. It had to be energized by a special high frequency, high voltage machine. The experiment was at once a success and a failure. Joe Corey was returned to a certain level of normalcy, but his psyche, his personality, was destroyed. He was a different person, and more importantly, his apparently rational behavior would suddenly give way to bursts of maniacal and homicidal fury. In these periods he was capable of unspeakable and subhuman acts of violence. Sergeant Ward, you can't know the torment I've suffered carrying this awful secret with me. I know it'll ruin me, but I just had to tell you, I had to. I hope you're not making a pitch for sympathy, doctor. It seems to me you're the monster here, not Joe Corey. You created and turned loose a homicidal maniac with an artificial brain, whose every action is completely unpredictable. You're right about one thing doctor, you're through. The fact is, I'd like to lock you up right now, except I'm not quite sure on exactly what grounds to arrest you. But when the district attorney gets my report, I'm sure he'll think of something. Goodnight, doctor. Well hi, Joe. How'd you know I was here? Hello Larry, I didn't. Hey, do me a favor, will ya? Cool it, you know? I'm mean, I'm going straight now, you know? Yeah sure, you're a good boy. Hey, could I buy you a drink, Joe? Yeah, bourbon on the rocks. Good. Hey, where's the broad, the singer? I don't know Joe, they closed out today and went on vacation. Where? I really don't know. Well, is there anybody around who does know? You see the broad on the end of the bar, Joe? Yeah. Go down and buy her a couple drinks, she'll tell ya anything ya wanna know. Thanks. Don't forget. Here's to the prettiest bride in the world. You wouldn't know, because you're always looking at somebody else. I'm not looking at anybody else. Oh, yes. What about the girl that just went by here? Why, I just looked at her legs, she walked by, I... Her legs and her something else. I'm going home. No, you don't wanna go home yet, honey. Have a little drink, it's our anniversary. I don't wanna have a little. Oh goodnight, kids. You mean, she took a bus? Yeah. Where? Are you sure you're just a fan? Lake Tahoe. Like me? Lake Tahoe? You really do wanna hear her sing, don't ya? You're gonna make me jealous. Don't be. I just like her music. Hey, turn the light on, will ya? I said turn the light on. Isn't this what you invited me up here for? Hey, let's, let's turn the lights on, huh? Oh, what's the matter, baby? Don't you wanna play? You broads are all the same, you've always gotta play it your way. Well, this time we're gonna play it my way. The right way. So long, honey. Hello, doc. Joe Corey. Long time, no see. What do you want? Why have you come here? I don't know, doc. I ain't thought about you for two years. In fact, I forgot all about you until the other night. Well, I had a dream the other night doc, a funny kind of dream. I dreamed I was in a room, a lot like this room, and I dreamed I was strapped to a table doc, a lot like that table. And then all of a sudden, all of a sudden, I felt like a million volts of electricity was shooting through my body. I couldn't stand it, I couldn't stand it. I thought the top of my head was gonna blow off. And I screamed stop, please stop. Well, then I opened my eyes, and I saw your face, your face staring at me. And then I remembered doc, then I remembered everything. But ah, I did it to help you, Corey. To save you from rotting away in a hospital for the rest of your life. Who asked you? Who asked you to put this thing in my brain? To give me all that pain? No one. I decided it was best, to give you back your life. Oh, you decided. And who are you to play God with my life? Now, how would you like it if someone strapped you to a table and burned you like a... Dr. Vanard died a much more horrible death than he really deserved. You know in many ways, the man was a genius, years ahead of his time. I'll be a son of a bitch. Well, what is it, lieutenant? Everyone involved in the Corey case, with one exception, is dead. What? Do we know who it is? Yeah. Who? Me. What? Homicide. Did you forget the other one, sir? Who? There's a Susan Vanard outside who wants to see you. Well, if she's a monster or an ape or some kind of fiend, maybe we've got our killer. Send her in. Send her in. Right this way, Miss Vanard. Lieutenant Cross? Monster, huh? Yes, please sit down. My name is Susan Vanard, my father is Dr. Vanard. I believe he was involved in a case that you investigated just before he died. How do you know that? Well, I just came from the office of my late father's lawyer, and he has nothing. No estate, no will, no affects, not even any satisfactory information. Pertaining to what? Lieutenant Cross, I feel very foolish telling you about this. You see, my father and I were never really that close. In fact, I've been in Europe for the last four years, and I plan on going back tomorrow or the next day. As I said before, I feel so foolish telling you about this. Yeah, but you haven't told me why. Well, I know you're going to laugh, but the other night I was asleep in my suite in the Carlisle, when all of a sudden, in the middle of the night, I was awakened by a very strange eerie voice, coming from God knows where. Then this voice told me, in deep sufulcrate tones, "come here, come here to where your father died and it will be the turning point of your life." Well, did it say whether it was going to do you a good turn or a bad turn. I told you you'd laugh. I'm not laughing. And you believed these disembodied voices? Lieutenant Cross, it was as though I were in some deep, voodoo trance, under some deep magic, being contacted telepathically from miles and miles away. This voice again, it... I heard it. There were deep drums, deep in a jungle, and water, rolling water, roaring waves. And this deep insistent, compelling voice. It was telling me... it was telling me these strange... Susan, come to your father. Come here, come here to me. Susan. Miss Vanard, you say you're going back to France. Yes, as soon as I can get away. Do me a favor. There's some loose ends connected with your late father's situation, if you meet or hear from anyone connected with your father's work, please let me know. Yes, of course. Thank you, lieutenant. That really sounded spooky, lieutenant. Listen to this. Mmhmm, I knew it rang a bell. Private Joe Corey, speaking at his military induction. My father Elton Corey has been missing in the wilds of Jamaica and Haiti for years. He was an anthropologist and interested in communication by telepathy, experiments in savage practices pertaining to centuries old religious rites, and ancient ceremonial acts related to voodoo. He's a very literate boy. I wonder where his father is now? No! No! What's wrong? I must have forgotten something. Where are my notes? Ah, forgot the adder of tangis root. Now we're on the right track. Patient Akro, the replenishment to your potion is forthcoming. Soon my son, you will be avenged. And they will know the pain and torture that you went through at their fiendish hands. Yes? Oh, I have some information and affects that you'd be very pleased to receive. Oh, I assure you Miss Vanard, I worked with your late father, God rest his soul, on many interesting experiments. Before he died he pleaded with me to find you. I sent you many letters, but they were all returned. It was just by chance that I... Well, I appreciate that sir, but um, perhaps you could send the information here where I'm staying. Oh no, no, I couldn't do that. You see I... I can't trust this valuable information to the postal system. Well, it's not that I don't want to meet you but... well, all right. But just to pick up my father's things. Oh yes, of course, I understand. My place is a little difficult to find. Could you meet me at Garden Street and Chester? Do you know where that is? Yes, I do. Fine, I'll meet you at nine. Come, now we can wreak. We can complete our revenge. Hello, could you please get me Central Police Station? Lieutenant Cross. Homicide. This is Susan Vanard. Oh yes, Miss Vanard. A friend of my father's just called me, and Lieutenant Cross told me to call him if any of my father's friends did contact me. It's probably not important, but I'm going to meet him at the corner of Garden and Chester at nine o'clock. I'm sure that Lieutenant Cross will be interested in what you have to say. Okay, thank you. 1813 go. 1L10 roger. What's that? Lieutenant, Susan Vanard is going alone to meet an old friend of her father's. Couldn't reach you, so I'm checking. Will be at Garden and Chester, Pete. Let's go. Miss Vanard. Over here. Good evening. No! No! No! Akro. Get him. Stop! Hold it! Lieutenant! Look at that. What's that? Yeah, it looks like some kind of message, lieutenant. No, those are numbers. What do they mean? It looks like the start of a license number. I think you're right. Look, get a hold of headquarters, tell them to get a computer on this. Fine, lieutenant. Ah, you're awake at last. Here, I have something that'll make you feel better. Miss Vanard, you're about to become one of my priceless creatures, like Akro there. Do you see that blue potion? That's the one that transforms you into my strong, mechanical, completely subservient slave. It's a delightful metamorphosis to watch. It's like changing a beautiful butterfly back into a caterpillar. Now, that's something I learned in the jungles of Jamaica. Then I command you, to kill someone, and after you kill, you get the red liquid. And then, then you become my beautiful butterfly again. You're insane. Well if so, all the worse for you. My dear Miss Vanard, the loneliness I feel now is all the fault of your father. My son Joe could have been cured of his injuries by my natural medicines, but your father had to make an electronic freak out of him before I could get to him. I don't know what you're talking about. My father only tried to help people. Well, that's a touching sentiment for the dead, but far from true. Once you father put an electronic brain in my son's head, Joe Corey died, and a psychotic killer was born. I can't believe it. It's true. Joe's last days were spent as a hunted, mad animal. When he went to Lake Tahoe, Joe didn't know this, but the whole network of police from California to Nevada were out looking for him. Sacramento, 30 minute rest stop. Mrs. Clarke, ah, Mrs. David Clarke? Yes? I'm Mr. Allen of the Canyon Motel. We received a telephone call from your husband, Mr. David Clarke, instructing us to meet you here. He's flying in a little later this afternoon on a plane. My husband is flying here? Are you surprised? Yes, I am. How did you know I was Mrs. Clarke? I was told to meet you here. He said he would explain everything when he arrived. Oh, you must be Nancy. Well, may I get your luggage? Yes, I guess so. We're gonna see daddy tonight. Oh boy! This way, Mrs. Clarke, we're on a very tight schedule. All right, everybody out of the car. Curtis, check the luggage. Come on, get out! Mama, mama! What is it you want? All right Mrs. Clarke, how about a few words? Well, what is it you want? A half a million in glass. What? You've got a half a million in jewelry that belongs to us. Oh, you mean that robbery yesterday? I didn't have anything to... Yes, I mean that robbery yesterday! Leave us alone! All right, honey! Will you take your hands off of her? Are you saying no, lady? You don't know anything about it? Well, of course I am, I don't... Let's call Vito. Operator. Los Angeles, Hollywood, 29649. I'm sorry sir, all the circuits are busy. Would you care to wait? Yeah. Not a noise, or you got a dead daughter. And don't try to call Curtis. There's just you and me baby, just you and me. Now I told you, I would kill you. I'm gonna get you boy. I'm gonna choke the life outta you! Nobody's gonna help you. Stop! Hold it up! Hey, stop! All right, get out of the car. Hey! I'm gonna kill you, Mrs. Clarke. Is somebody there? Please, is there anybody there? Officer. The officers know they were in this area. They're trying to pinpoint it exactly. Look, you don't know this guy. He gets his kicks outta hurting people. Yeah. Come on, Nancy. The road's blocked, we've gotta run. Hurry. This may be the break we've been waiting for. If they only woulda found the damn jewels, none of this woulda happened. Oh God, it's gonna be a nightmare. Easy, Dave. Why did it have to happen to us. Now look, there's no sense torturing yourself. Now, they're not gonna hurt Nancy and Linda, I promise you. Not as long as they think the only chance they have of getting those jewels back is through them. Let's go, we got a pretty good idea where they are. Mommy, my dolly's stuck. Harry, you work your way up there. Fire a shot if you see anything. Come on, let's hurry. Linda! Nancy! Linda, Nancy! Linda! Nancy! Linda, Nancy! Please mommy, I'm so tired. Wait, Nancy. Don't step in the snow. Be quiet. Stay close to the rock. Nancy! Linda! Nancy! Linda! Nancy! Linda! Nancy! Linda! I'm tired mommy, I can't go on. You've gotta keep going. Work your way up that way. It's the end of the line, baby. Mommy, I dropped my dolly. Hold it. So you see, Miss Vanard, my son was shot down as a mad killer. And as he died, so must those who killed him. And now you can help me square my debt. Sergeant Grimaldi here, sir. This is it, 1217 Verbena Drive. Meet me over in the warehouse section. It's near you. Yeah, 1217 Verbena Drive, right sir. Move in, but use your own discretion. I'm on my way. I'll be right behind you, sir. Now for a very necessary injection. Drop that needle and get away from the girl. You're interfering with my experiments on Akro. I says put that needle down. That's right. Now get against the wall. I said get against the wall! Everything's gonna be all right now, just sit down. Now look, can't we talk about this? I said sit down! Just sit down. Well, shall we proceed before there are anymore interruptions? No, don't. There, now this, plus the fluid you swallowed earlier, will make you my slave. What's happened to me? As your father experimented on my son, so you shall serve me. But you have Arko. His days are numbered. You see, the formula doesn't work on him as it once did. His body is fighting it. I can't waste anymore time, so he shall die. And I want you to remember, this red potion is the only thing that can return you, shall we say, to my beautiful butterfly. I feel numb all over. I don't feel anything. I thought... Akro, get back in your cage. What are you doing? I know what you want. You want this. But this is all there's left. When this is gone, you die. Do you understand what I'm saying? Akro. No! No! No! Come on. You're all right. Operator, get me the police department.
