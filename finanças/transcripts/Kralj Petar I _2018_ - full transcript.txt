KING PETAR I You probably expected a man that's better and more handsome than any of the previous kings. A man to astound everyone, win everyone over, and meet every expectation. You have before you but a humble old man. I have come to tell you that I am willing to accept the throne of Serbia granted me by God and by the people. I promise to put all my interests aside and that my only concern shall always be the Serbian people. I shall warrant with my life the freedom and the rights of the people I will lead. On June 24, 1914 king Petar I abdicated in favor of his son Aleksandar. Franz Ferdinand - heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne was assassinated in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914. Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia for it. On July 23, 1914 it presented the Serbian government with a list of demands that no independent state could accept. These events led to the Great War, the bloodiest war ever. July 24th 1914 WAR IS INEVITABLE IT'S ALL OVER RELATIONS BETWEEN SERBIA AND AUSTRIA-HUNGARY SEVERED! All who are not part of the High Command, leave the room. Key Makeup artist Dušica Vuksanović Visual Effects Ivan Èolić We hoped that the diplomatic efforts of the Russian Ambassador would give results. -But now... -We have no choice but to fight and die. The mobilization plans drawn by Mr. Putnik should come into effect as of tonight. Our farmer-soldiers have barely taken their uniforms off. I suggest we also call his majesty King Petar. I think we need his wisdom at this moment. Good... This is fine. Arthritis is an autoimmune disease. Your body, for some reason, produces antibodies. They attack your cartilage, even though it's healthy. The organism is practically attacking itself. Do not skip your warm, relaxing baths, even when you seem to be alright. "Their horrible request has no precedent! Now all hopes lie with Russia and its promise of a diplomatic mediation. You are needed, Petar. By Pašić, the High Command and by your son Aleksandar." Now I'm needed... Are you writing? My advice is for the government to accept their requests. What now looks like a weakness, will be seen as diplomacy in future. What seems punishment now, will spare us from greater destruction tomorrow. And what looks like spite today will be sheer stupidity tomorrow. My son, regent Aleksandar will surely make the right decision. Protect yourself from the cold! Is that clear? Right. -And don't go hungry. -Right, mother. Come on, Marinko! We're all waiting! Remember what I'm about to tell you now. Else you'll end up like your late father. When there's a charge, don't be the first, nor the last. Don't worry, I'll be back before winter comes. My dear son... -War scatters people at its own will. -I'll write. Marinko we're waiting! They're calling me. Farewell. Marinko, the war will end by the time you get ready! Hello brothers! Are you all right? Let's go! Mother! Please don't! -Don't... -Where's your husband? So you don't know where he is? Where is your husband? Which of you had no training, or has no combat experience? -I! -Feeder! And you, loader! You have no experience? -No. -You'll lead horses! That's St. Elijah, the thunderer. We leave in an hour! The battery shall pack food for two days. At ease. Who had no training, or has no combat experience? -I didn't... -Feeder! And you, loader. All others, hand me your army booklets. Timer! I served in the artillery. At Kumanovo. Assistant aimer! I know that one, captain! Feeder! Yessir! Života, give them their assignments. Save ammunition. No wasting! Measure thrice... Five times! -Get ready to move out. -Yes sir. Hand me that brandy. Majesty, I greatly admire all of your military achievements, and the courage you've shown in battle. -All the stories I've heard about you... -Aren't true! No truth in them. All that's said about war, isn't true. Soldier, you're still wet behind your ears. You all want to defend your homeland thinking there's nothing nicer in life. And then, if you're lucky, you get killed early on. So you don't get to watch your companions getting killed. Death is everywhere. Ugly and accidental. Those that deserve it are not the ones to die. Rather it's those that fate has chosen to meet the bullet. In war, after a few weeks, you loose your soul and your mind. All that's left of you is your name. What makes you go on is just your instinct. Of an animal... Great courage in war is no virtue. War is chaos, mindlessness. Anyone that manages to keep his cool in that hell, simply isn't normal. Human lives are not the worst thing that's lost in war. War kills the soul in each of us. And I've fought enough wars... It would be logical to expect them to cross the river Sava and then continue the advance centrally, along the basin of the river Velika Morava. That's certainly what I would do in their place. Still, there have been incursions in the villages of Lešnica and Jelav along the river Drina. Word is that they've drafted our brethren from Herzegovina to attack their own people on this side of the river Drina. We should get our troops ready to march. To Mt. Cer! What's your name? I'm Momčilo Gavrić from Trbušnica near Loznica. Why aren't you at home with your parents, young Gavrić? I've no one any more. The Krauts killed my whole family and torched the village. My Mother and seven brothers and sisters. Damned Krauts! You're too young for the army. I want to avenge my loved ones! Or die. See that wagon behind me? Say that Capt. Savić sent you. They'll take care of you. Is that clear? Go now! Engineers, move the wagon uphill! Back to your duties! Mind the horses! Don't let steel rub against them... Damned cough! "Oh, Serbia mother dear Thou must not shed a tear. When you beckon, when you send your call, we'll come one an all!" Hold it there! Camouflage it! Easy now! To the right! The hand rub isn't helping any. I need you to use your feet. Your Majesty, an urgent telegram for you! Slip it under the door! I know what's it about. A new damned war has started. Open fire on Kosanin Grad! Orders by general Stepanović! Open fire on Kosanin Grad Hill! Understood! Coordinates 32/0. Distance 3200! -Wait for the order to fire. -Yessir! Open fire on the enemy battery on the edge of the forest. Coordinates... -32 and 0. -Distance 3200! -3250... We'll be short. 32/0! Distance 3200! 32/0... Distance 3200. 32/0. Distance 3200. Three shells per piece! Rapid fire! Fire! Range correction salvo! Same elements! Fire! They got us in their sights! -They're hitting us. We're exposed! -You don't say? Over here! Quick! Put it out! Throw dirt on it! Bring more shells! This is not good... We're hitting short and wasting ammunition! Set range 3230! I knew it wasn't enough. It's all right. You'll make it. Call the medics! Wait, the shell! Call the medics! Mother... It's all right, you'll make it. Calm down... Put out the fire! Throw dirt on it! Medic! Over here! Resupply the ammunition. Medics are coming! Take over, kid. Take over! Snap out! You're the aimer now! Go on. Follow me, men! Charge, my falcons! Charge! Run up that hill! Hand grenades! -What now captain? -Get more shells! Call the command. We're out of shells! Increase the distance by 50 meters. Set the fuse so it explodes when it digs into the ground. Two shells and then we'll correct if needed. Života... Just align this sight with that ring over there. The wheel is used... I'll explain if we survive this! Same coordinates, fire at will! Fire! Did we get them? You're finally shooting right! We've got the bastards! Don't waist shells. It's the infantry's turn now. Hold your fire! Enemy artillery positions have been destroyed! Get them now, boys! -Where are you going? -It's time to fight! Why did you kill him? Let me go! Put me down! -Let me go! -Move! Stay here and settle down! Signal our victory! "Dear Mother. I'm writing as I promised. I'm alive and well. We've been digging trenches for two weeks now. There'll be more of that, I reckon. We're stuck here, and get little rest and sleep. The rain is the biggest problem. It pours down day and night. Lice are also dropping off our shaven heads. Had anyone told me this is war, I would have called him a liar. Some say our troops are pulling out elsewhere along the front. After Mt. Cer, a mighty force pounced on us. And we even have to spare our ammunition. Death is all around us. It's always with us. You can hear a bullet sinking into a man. You don't forget that. It's like nothing else... I'm now used to them dying. But I can't bear seeing our men go." Let's move out, soldier. Life won't wait for us. Nor will death! -Bad move. Not that again? -Oh yes! -"My dear home county..." -I bet five! Right! "Where I was born..." I bet I'll get "Sheshbesh"! "I think of you all the time..." I'm so sorry, my friend. Really sorry! Nothing personal, but that's mine too. "I think of you all the time..." Take this. I guess rations will come soon. Beans today, cabbage tomorrow! And then for a change it'll be beans followed by cabbage! I can't eat cabbage any more. Be glad that there's still a choice! Thing can only get worse. Don't worry. There'll always be something for you. I'm not worried. I can do without food if needed. Života, when will you teach me how to use the sights? -How about now? -Great! Orders to move out have come. We leave in an hour. Where to? No stupid questions. Get the cannons ready! They said: "No pulling back. At the cost of life!" Silence! It's good if we're to retreat. We have nothing to fight with anyway. Victory, Your Majesty! Enemy troops have been driven back across the Drina and Sava. Austro-Hungarian forces had 18500 dead and wounded. And us? Your Majesty, we had 4700 dead and 11000 wounded. But have no worry, the Serbian army is holding up well against a numerically and technically superior enemy! Why have they sent for me, then? With due respect, the people want to see you! I see you are armed now... You're in charge of the tools. Spades and hatches and all! We've fought for two months and now we're to retreat... What's next? I'd like to ask them that! -Good day... -Indeed. Are you from the artillery? Yes we are. What brings you here? Maybe you know Marinko Spasojević from Slovac? I don't know him. Damn the Krauts, may their breed go extinct! Which division, regiment and company is he in? I know that he's with general Stepa Stepanović. Just like all of us here! -Let me give you a hand... -Thank you. A truce is not possible! I've ordered my troops to withdraw to the interior. We'll be giving them Belgrade without a fight. On a platter! Hold on, gentlemen... Let's hear Gen. Mišić. I don't intend to be on the defensive, but to attack. First of all, the disorderly retreat must be turned into proper, regular withdrawal. The withdrawal will lure the enemy into a trap. Once he realizes that the Serbian army is pulling back, Potiorek will turn on Belgrade. When they pounce on Belgrade and thus turn their back to us, we have to launch a furious attack. I assure you they will curse the day they were born. Well, I like it! Where do we get the artillery shells for this counter-attack? Damn... you can do that much for this victory, that will be remembered for a long time. Get the signalers to connect me to Greece, France, Russia and Great Britain. I'll secure the ammunition. -Have the connections been established? -Yes, Majesty! To the Russian Emperor Nicolas II Romanov... ...our country now faces the most difficult moment since the declaration of war made by the Austria-Hungary. To Mr. Venizelos, Prime Minister of Greece. Dear Sir. I hereby submit to you my request... My appeal for assistance, since Serbia is in mortal danger... Serbia and France are allies from the start of this war. Now that Serbia faces certain destruction, I must kneel before you and ask for financial assistance... Thank You for the unselfish aid and support to our people. I hereby inform you that I have reached an agreement with our French allies. They will pay you for the said ammunition that you should send us as soon as possible. For the financial, political and military assistance, as King of Serbia, I vow that in the shortest time possible, I will erect a monument of gratitude to Russia. The Greek government, headed by Mr. Venizelos, has already promised us aid in artillery ammunition should your country grants us financial support. Your Majesty. In this crucial moment for your country... The unbreakable ties between our two peoples... Neither You nor your country shall kneel before anyone. We'll gladly grant you the aid you have requested! My Frenchmen! The French! They will send it all through Greece by train. They ask for guarantees that we'll repay them after the war through war reparations... The French, indeed. Hurry up, it must be distributed by this evening! -Hold it. What are those? -Shrapnel! Keep them separate from the explosive ones! Bring in the next wagon! -What's our regiment? -The iron one! -Who are we? -The Iron Regiment! -I can't hear you! -The Iron Regiment! -Who will we wipe out? -The Krauts! -What was that? -The Krauts! "To die we're ready one and all or in freedom we'll stand tall! From a stream of our blood freedom shall come as a flood! From a stream of our blood freedom shall come as a flood!" Fix bayonets! The fearless march forward with determination and trusting in God! Fire! Follow me, men! Charge! Artillerymen, weapon in hand! Follow me bravely! Charge! I swear before God and my people that I will guide Serbia along the path of peace and progress, and that I will do all I can to keep my people from destruction that it already faced far too often. Without its people, there is no Serbia. Hence, I will fight with all my strength to treat every human life as sacred. Who are you, son? Momčilo Gavrić, 6th Artillery Regiment of the Drina Division. -What are you doing!? -Trying to get myself a rifle. -Son... -Don't chase me away, Majestuous. I have nowhere to go. All of my folk have been killed. -You should help with the wounded! -I will, Majestuous. That's an order, soldier! Yes Sir! Go on. Was that a three? Look at this! Score! Your play! Marinko, why is everyone so happy? There's word of King Petar coming to visit us. Majestuous? What is it you're writing? A letter to my mother. I promised I would write. So what did you write in your letter? About the war. About the victory in the Battle of Kolubara. Last night I dreamt I was in my village. And that mother was bringing me apples. Smiling at me. I was so sad when I woke up. It was just a dream. Do you want me to show you how to use the sights? Sure. It can wait... On your feet! Atten-tion! Your Majesty! The 2nd battery of the Drina Division 6th Artillery Regiment has been marshalled in Your honor! -Trusting in God, soldiers! -God be with you! Soldier Momčilo Gavrić, step forward! By order of his Majesty King Petar I Karađorđević Soldier Momčilo Gavrić, son of the Drina Division Is hereby promoted to the rank of corporal! Those in favor, step forward! They all agree, soldier! -Congratulations! -Thank you, Majestuous! "Mother, we've chased them back across the Drina again. We won't let them take our dear Serbia! I've seen King Petar. He came to visit us! Our old king. I'm managing somehow. I hope you are well too and that you're not hungry. I didn't bring along the socks you've made for me. I could sure use them now." Sure you could! I know you need them. "In their leaflets Krauts say that Bulgarians are about to attack us too. We have nothing left to fight with. We've used up our ammunition in the Battle of Kolubara. Many say that's why we'll lose and the Krauts'll take Serbia. I know we will not! We'll never surrender, mother." Damned Krauts, may their breed go extinct! "Should people start to flee, go along with them to Niš. Your loving son." Halt. Stop. What is it? We've fallen behind. I can't see the others. Damn this fog. You're still smoking my tobacco? -It's not yours, it's mine! -How about lending me one? -I have none left. -Života, please. Hush. Take it. It could have easily been my last. God forbid! A Bulgarian reconnaissance unit! They're gone. We'll go that way. If it weren't for you, it would have ended badly. We'll all be killed. By the Krauts, the Austrian- Hungarians or the Bulgarians. The government has already fled from Niš. Any news on the whereabouts of the troops? Who knows! They're all going in the same direction. -Where? -To Kosovo. Stay back! You can't board! This car is for the wounded men from Kolubara! Are you sure this will take us to Prizren? We will. In time for dinner. We won't be eating dinner for a while. If I only had some tobacco. Pick up the pace! Does anyone know where's Gen. Stepanović's army headed? Marinko... Marinko! Do you have some dry bread? There are three paths ahead of us. The first is to launch a counter attack against this three-headed enemy. That would lead us to destruction. Might be, though not necessarily. The second path is the retreat across the Albanian mountains. To try to reconnect with the Allies in Corfu. As I understand, this is what the government recommends. The Austrians are following us along the valley of the Lim. To cut off our withdrawal. In that case, we need to hasten. Macedonia is no longer an option? No. The Bulgarians hold most of the Vardar basin in Macedonia. The Allies have failed to break through. The third option is striking an agreement. You mean, surrender? If we agree that this is best for our country and people. Supreme commander, we must take a decision. Those in favor of the offensive raise their right hand. Those in favor of the retreat, raise their left hand. Three against three. Your Highness... The enemy has shown on many occasions how he treats those that surrender to him. We have nothing to hope for in that sense. We wouldn't get out alive. Without ammunition, we can't fight against three armies. That would just be a sacrifice. As King of Serbs, I order the withdrawal across Albania. Of all our troops and people. Long live the king! Never mind that. Mišić! Let him go. My children. My people, my soldiers! We've been victorious, but must withdraw. God only knows what that is good for. You have sworn to the Fatherland and to your King that you will fight to the last drop of your blood. I now release you from the oath you've given me. To those that want to go home, I say: God keep you! Go to your homes and I give you my word that no one will suffer any consequences for it. Whether your country will forgive you for it... That's something you'll have to settle with it. We are facing a retreat across the Albanian mountains. Many will not come back. I, your old King, shall stay with you. I promise that we will return to defend Kosovo and Serbia! If we do not get back alive, we'll haunt them from our graves until Judgment Day! Your Majesty, may I help you? The king can manage. See you on the other side! Petar... My husband was killed fighting for you in the 2nd Balkan War. I must not loose my only son Marinko too. I gave you my husband. My only son I will not. We're ready... I've made these socks for him. I beg You in the name of God... Find him and give this to him. Marinko Spasojević from the village of Slovac! From his mother Makrena! Do you know his regiment and division? Gunnery. He's with Stepanović's army! Come on, pull! Soldier, where is Stepa Stepanović? We're catching up with the rear of the 2nd Army. Voivode Stepanović is ahead, with the Command. Take a horse, catch up with him and tell him to wait up for me. Yessir! How can I help, Your Majesty? I'm looking for a soldier named Marinko Spasojević. -He's serving in your army. -Why are you looking for him? I need to give him something. To do something meaningful in this mayhem. -Which branch is he in? -Your artillery. You know his division and battery? I don't know. I've split up my artillery. The first two divisions took this road towards the Old Pass. The third is headed up to the canyon. That's where they'll destroy their guns. I couldn't watch that. Života, it's been a while that I wanted to ask you... Speak up. When we met, on the eve of the battle on Mt. Cer. Even though you didn't know me, you said you did. Why? Pull harder! -You've never told me why. -I don't know. Turn it around. -Eternal glory, Elijah! -And thank you. -Života... -What? You knew I had no experience, but you took me on. -I thought I knew you from somewhere. -How come? Just leave me alone. What's gotten into you? You've never told me a thing about your life. If I had all the answers, I'd be a government minister! Move it, they're waiting for us. There isn't much to say. I have a house with some land. There's a few walnut trees, a pear tree and some plum trees. I can hardly recall my mother. She died when I was about his age. All my life, I wanted to have a daughter. I didn't get around to it with all these wars. Everyone else wanted a son. Only I wanted... a girl. Don't ask me why, because I do not know. Your Majesty! Col. Dimitrijević! -Can I help you, Your Majesty? -No need to. I'm determined to stand by Your Majesty. -I just wanted You to know. -It's all right, Dragutin. Apis! There's a thing you could help me with. Marinko where are we going? People, stop! What's happening here? -Get up, soldier. -I beg you... On your feet! That's it! Get up, damn it! Move on! On the double! We must reach the camp by dawn. They'll leave without us! We can't all perish because of a single man. Don't leave me... Move on! Don't go... Please. -Trusting in God, men! -God be with you! -Can you make it, Momčilo? - I'm so exhausted. Let's take a rest. -Can a man die of hunger? -You die if you don't eat. Don't worry. I'll take care of you. -Get up! -Just a little, Života. -Get going! -Don't be like that. If you sit down, you'll never get up. Give me your hand. I'm hungry. Give him to me. I'll take over now. No sleeping! Wake up! Your Majesty, I'm sergeant Milojević. This way, please. -Don't we shake hands? -Sure, Your Majesty! -Trusting in God, soldiers! -God be with you! God be with you! Does anyone know soldier Marinko Spasojević from the village of Slovac near Valjevo? Is he an artilleryman? Yes. With Voivode Stepanović, like you. I know who Marinko is! -What's his regiment and battery? -What's his unit? Pardon him, he's gone deaf in the Battle of Kolubara. What's his battery? Isn't he the one in Života's crew? Marko from Brgul might know! -Which Marko? -The one we called Rotten Egg! The short one that played "Sheshbesh" with Života. -Where is he? -Dead, Your Majesty. If he's the one I think he is... It's the Drina Division! Života is in the 7th Regiment. Where are they now? I haven't seen them for a couple of days. Thank you, soldiers! -Hold fast, my sons! -We will, Your Majesty! Života! Come back! What is it? -I can't go any further. -You must. Let's rest a while. We'll catch up with them. If you stay here, you won't survive the night. Neither will him. Get up. What are you saying? -What did you say? -Get up! We have to reach the camp by daybreak. Any way we can. Get up. I can't walk! Wait, please. Života! If you don't leave him, you're finished too. I'm not leaving him. Take it. This too. It's all I have. Farewell. Života... Života! Can't you be more careful? Does anyone have some paper? Do you have a piece of paper? No lagging behind! No sleeping! Whoever stops will never get up again! Hold fast, soldiers! You, get up! Hold fast! Come on, sing! Not much left to the camp! Soldier, a song! If you're cold, dance to warm up! "Young Captain, where are you coming from? I come from the banks of the Vardar, from a bloody battle. Young captain, do you know my sweetheart? A simple soldier by the name of Jovan." Are any of you from the Drina Division? Majesty, why is this soldier so important to you? Go back, solder. You're still in time. This is my battle. Marinko... Nothing here... Just the damn snow. Momčilo... Trusting in God! I seek Marinko Spasojević, from the village of Slovac. Drina Division, 7th Artillery Regiment. The young one? How did we get here? I carried you. -There he is! -Who? Over there! You're imagining it, Momčilo. There is no one there. Calm down. Calm down. Fever. The both of us. Momčilo... Those are our troops! Momčilo! Brothers! Brothers... Brothers... Oh, mother dear... Sweet mother. Don't cry, Marinko. Please! Mother! Your Majesty, I didn't find out much about that soldier. Is he alive? I don't know. He might be, if he's in the group that got scattered on the way to the mountain pass. If he's alive, that's where he is. Four hours from here. Momčilo, tell me about your village Trbušnica... How many homes are there? Don't sleep! About a hundred homesteads... At least before the Krauts came. Did you have sheep? We had... Eight. And plum trees? Plum trees? Did your father make brandy? Don't sleep! I'm not sleeping. It's just that my clothes are so thin... Majesty, do we take a rest? Come here. It's far enough. Let's go back. We go on! -Soldier! -Majestuous... My little soldier. Never forget this sight, soldier. You must tell others about it. Let this be the last war our people had to die in. I give you my word, that I will be a true constitutional king of Serbia. and that as ruler, I will strive for the freedom, peace and progress of my people. From this day forth, as your king, I'll defend these sacred goals with my life and my honor. You have my word! Don't, you'll drown! "ON LIBERTY" by John Stuart Mill That book... Where did you get it? Found it on the road. Better yet, it found me. It is innate to every man to be free. To be able to fulfill his call, here on earth. The way I see it, we're all free in one way only. To suffer. It's title is "On Liberty". Could you help me out... I'm glad that this book was useful to someone. What else does that book say? That liberty is the point of human existence. I'm not the man for that book. All my life, I've been free to do as I please. And I've always made the worse choices. -Here you are. -Thank you. Back at the time when they called me Pierre, I fought at Sedan with my comrade Francois Messer. A grenade blew him to pieces. But that saved me. His legs over there, his head to the other side... I picked up the pieces and put them in a sack. I carried that sack on my back the whole day. Looking for the prettiest place to burry him. I carried my freedom in a sack. You wouldn't be King Petar, would you? Had someone told me I'd be smoking with the king... Troops, turn back! Fall in! Atten-tion! "Way yonder... Far away from the sea. There my sweet village lies. That's where my Serbia awaits. Way yonder, where the yellow lemon blooms That's where the Serbian army Had to make its way." "That's where the Serbian army had to make its way." After its martyrdom in Albania, the Serbian Army recovered on the island of Corfu. With the Allies, it sealed the victory in the Great War. According to the Paris Peace Conference data Serbia had lost a third of its population: 1.3 million people. In the Great War no nation paid such a price for its freedom. King Petar I found Makrena Spasojević's grave after the war. She died brokenhearted for the loss of her son. The King financed a monument to Makrena and Marinko. He died on August 16, 1921 as the most beloved Serbian king. Oh why did I have to face such a sad, horrible night. When you, my darling one went off in a war to fight. When you, my darling one went off in a war to fight. Way yonder... where the whitest lilies bloom That's where father and son met their terrible doom. That's where father and son both met their terrible doom.
