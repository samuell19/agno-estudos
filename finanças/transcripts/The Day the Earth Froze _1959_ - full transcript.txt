Suomi-Filmi presents Based on the themes of Kalevala Made as a Mosfilm and Suomi-Filmi co-production in 1959 This film is dedicated to the memory - of Elias Lönnrot, the collector of Karelian folklore. Mastered by desire impulsive, by a mighty inward urging, I am ready now for singing, ready to begin the chanting Golden friend, and dearest brother, brother dear of mine in childhood, Let us clasp our hands together fingers intertwined with fingers Come and sing with me the stories, come and chant with me the legends. You did your chores, Lemminkäinen. Go on home now. Hello! Hello! Mother! Darling Goldilocks! Ilmarinen! Annikki, dear sister. What is on your mind? The eyes as blue as the sea. Canst thou forge for us the Sampo, hammer us the lid in colours? On one side to grind the flour, on another to make the salt. We would never go hungry if we had the Sampo. Cannot forge for thee the Sampo without heavenly fire. Fire from the nave of the sky. Where has the spark gone, the one given to us by thunder? Louhi took the spark to the stony hills of Northland. Sampo! Sampo! Sampo! Sampo! Sampo! Sampo! Sampo! Have you already forged the Sampo? Hammered me the lid in colours? You'll never have the wisdom to forge such things! We tried with all our might! Throw this jester into the pit with vipers and snakes! Have mercy, my dear lady! There is one who can forge it, hammer you the lid in colours! - Who is it? - It is Ilmarinen the blacksmith, the ancient forging master. On the plains of Kalevala. He, the one that forged the heavens, forged the air a hollow cover. Listen, wizard. Bring this Ilmarinen to me, so that I can have a look at him. Rise up, blacksmith. Come to the banks of Northland. Rise up, blacksmith. Come to the banks of Northland. Rise up, come here! Come here! Annikki, dear sister. The sister of Ilmarinen, the most crafty forging master. We are bound to get the Sampo. Fly, fly, my cloak. Cross the sea like a storm. Hello, sun, to your pretty face for rising up so beautifully From under the ground and way up above the trees Make your way safe and sound, travel without harm End your journey beautifully and pleasantly come the evening End your journey beautifully and pleasantly come the evening Annikki! Annikki! Annikki! Fly, fly, Goldilocks, to the courtyards of Kalevala. Thereto take my message. Bitter in this place of ruin. Thus will I, chick, disappear Thus will I, fair maiden, perish Within a hill of copper Imprisoned in a cave by Louhi This is the last thing you'll do, and it will be the end of you! Ilmarinen! Your graceful sister is in the darkness of Northland. Annikki. Give me your sword so I can rescue the maiden. Bide a while, Lemminkäinen. I shall accompany you. Hear this, old Väinämöinen. The evil lady of Northland has just captured Annikki. Where can I get a vessel so we can sail there? It is a vast, open sea to sail. A long way to travel. Be that as it may, I will hastily give you a vessel which will glide on the surging waves like a swan. Help us, old Väinämöinen! Here is an oak to work on, a wonderful tree to build a boat. It will take us to Northland to aid dear Annikki in distress. - Who on earth are you? - We are the winds. The winds? - I came from the west. - I am a great summer's wind. - From the far north-east. - I stood still as a thick fog. Fog? I blew from the farthest North, freezing everything on my way. Who is this talking? I am Frost, son of gale, bringer of cold weather. Please release me from these chains, untie my cumbersome restraints. So, Annikki dear, I will give you chores, some work to do to pass your time, make your day fly by with haste. May the sun shine onto you. Glide upon the trackless waters, sail away, my ship of magic Sail without the touch of hand without an oar to propel thee Caress the vessel, dear wind Guide it across the wide blue sea Bring the men to Northland, then Brave young souls to the coldness there Come out, you seers! Down from the cliffs, wizards! Whose is this boat approaching us through the waves? Milady! One is Lemminkäinen and the other Ilmarinen the blacksmith! Greetings to you! Thank you for your welcome! Is there space for us to draw our ship ashore? Dry land to rest it on? Ground for us to fight on? Yard enough for us to battle? - I suppose we have room for you. Places for throat-cutting. To kill such a scoundrel, slay a no-good man. What are you babbling about, vile woman? Give Annikki back to us. Let the poor thing board the boat. I will not give her to you. Let this arrow fly toward you, split the spleen of this evil woman! Hold on, Lemminkäinen. What will you give me as ransom for the young maiden? What are you asking for? If you plough my field full of vipers! I shall do it! Take me to the field. Give to me your plough. Bring forth a horse to pull it. I shall not give to you my plough, nor my horse to the mouth of vipers. I will make you a pleasing plough and harness a good horse, too. Milady! Soon Lemminkäinen will be ploughing the field of vipers. He will take the girl back. Poor men will be left without a vessel. Boatless, our dear guests. I have ploughed your field of vipers. May it grow viperless from this day forth. Bring forth our Annikki! I shall give her to you. But how will you take her to sea? A pike splashed around here with its mighty tail. He whipped your boat to pieces, snapped the arcs into bits. I will make a new vessel. Replace it with an iron one. So the giant pike may bite away and break his teeth while trying. A boat is emerging from the fire, a boat is emerging! If you are asking for a ride to the underworld, there is your vessel. - Banish the horrid ship! Now give Annikki back to us. - Your maiden is not ready. - Damn you and your lies. You ploughed the field, but you will not get your sister without more serious chores. Well, what do you ask of me? Forge a Sampo on our rock, hammer us the lid in colours. Listen, Lady of the North. I'll make you tools. If you won't forge me the Sampo, you will not get your sister alive. - Listen, Lady of the North. - Hammer me the lid in colours! Wilt thou forge the Sampo? I guess I will forge the Sampo. Like I once forged the sky. We will take Annikki back. Bring her home with us. - Well? - From the tips of white-swan feathers, from the finest wool of lambkins, from a single grain of barley. These will make the Sampo. From the tips of white-swan feathers. From the finest wool of lambkins. From a single grain of barley. These will make the Sampo. Sampo! Sampo! Sampo. Give me fire for my furnace from the nave of the sky! The nave of the sky? The ground must be ploughed to grow, fishnets thrown in water to feed one. Sampo cannot be made without fire. He wants the enchanted flame. Then we'll have our Sampo, with a beautiful lid in colours! - On one side to grind the flour. - On another to make the salt. A moneymaker on the third! Get the wizards to labour. Make them work the bellows. Inflame the inflamers! Will the Sampo be ready soon? Make everyone labour, work the bellows more mightily! Inflame the inflamers! Work the bellows! Water! Bring water hither! Sampo. Sampo! Sampo... Well? Now, woman, give me my Annikki. Did our new Sampo work its lid in colours? Thus let the Sampo be born. May it work its lid in colours. - Where is my sister? - You can have the girl. - Annikki. - Lemminkäinen. Annikki. Dear sister. Leave this place, you dogs! Finally the duckling is under my wing, my favourite bird by my side. I will never give up my darling, never forget my dear maiden. What did you give for me? Miserable, little me? Your brother, he forged a Sampo for your ransom. He gave Northland the Sampo? There goes the fortune of our people, just to release poor little me. Annikki, my sister. When we reach our destination and arrive back home, I'll go and retrieve the Sampo. It is about time that I, too, did some manly chores. - Don't! - Lemminkäinen! Welcome back, dear friend! Please stay for the week! Be welcomed to our courtyard. Could you be man enough to drink this beer I offer? Now listen, you heathen! Dirty scoundrel! Why did you come back? You know why! I came back to get the Sampo, retrieve the lid in colours. I'll take the Sampo back to the plains of Kalevala. If you won't settle for less, take what you came for. Go! Well? Go! If you are up to the task. Why do you put your swords down and go in weaponless? A sword would taint the Sampo. A blade would blemish the lid in colours. Sampo. That is the end of Lemminkäinen. The demise of your poor son. That is a flagrant lie! Easy now, Annikki. Soon you'll be a beautiful bride, dancing your wedding for a week. Oh birch, you white-belted one. Did you not see my son? I have enough care already, pitiful my own misfortunes. My belt is cut with knives, the leaves stripped from my head. Oh pathway, you finest of sands. Did you not see my son? I have enough care already, pitiful my own misfortunes. They trample me with war-horses, wear me out with iron hooves. Oh sun, you golden spindle. Did you not see my son? Your son is in the distance. In the darkness of Northland. Who arrives uninvited, comes without company? Where is my poor son? I know not about your son, or where he might have gone. He might have been eaten by wolves or gnawed up by bears. I know you are lying. Wolves can't touch my kin! He puts them down with bare hands. Battles bears without weapons. Where have you put my son? Ask the fish in the sea, the perch deep beneath the waves. Sea. Give up my son. Push him back ashore. Get up, my son. Rise up from your dreaming. Golden apple of my eye, my silver staff to lean on. What good is a dead man? What use a drowned steed? Oh pathway, you misfortunate one. Please, save my son. The ground is never alone, roads never emerge unaided. Use them to save your son. Of birch, you misfortunate one. Please, save my son. I will spill a drop for thee, sap from underneath my bark, a tiny drip of tree nectar. Take it from my belt. Use it to save your son. Oh sun, you golden spindle, shine between the clouds. Please, save my son. Mother. Son. I thank thee, birch. Pathway, I thank thee more still. Oh sun, you golden spindle. I thank thee most of all. Mother, my resurrector. You awaited a week. Wait a while longer. Then I'll be back. - Where are you going, my only one? - I have to retrieve the Sampo. Sampo! I won't come back from Northland and face Annikki without carrying the lid in colours. The day will not save you again, the sun give you another life. Sampo must be brought home, and its gifts where they belong. Thou shalt not come here! So, you help yourself? Tie him to the rock! Where did this fog come from? Go, whence you came! Puffing without permission, you. Poor me, look at this! Who has done this deed? Lemminkäinen. He who retrieves the Sampo, brings back the lid in colours, shall have a helmet full of gold, a blanket filled with silver. Sampo! Rise, you wind, and blow! Do away with young Lemminkäinen! The steed sank into the sea, drowned beneath the waves. Gone is now my poor man My Goldilocks disappeared Beneath the waves so deep Into the blackness deep below The waters took my dearest one Do not ever in a million years Draw your nets for fish in this vast bay of our sea And my mother my forebearer May she never in a million years Get the water for her kettle from this well so evil... Lemminkäinen! Oh, Lemminkäinen. My Son! The worry of my kin guarded me. Long as I was sleeping. The Sampo sank into the deep. So little is left of it. A piece of the heart of Sampo. Don't you worry, Lemminkäinen. Just let the days pass. There will be use for it yet, the last morsel of Sampo. Within it lies the seed and beginning of eternal happiness. May Kalevala emerge here on the banks of Northland! May Kalevala emerge here on the banks of Northland! Lemminkäinen is alive. The scoundrel cheated death. I will use my cloak and fly to Kalevala! - The groom got a fine maiden. - Like the other pea in the pod. - Like a strawberry in the field. - A small bird in a tree. Fine feathers up a birch tree, white breast on a maple branch. A pretty grass on a lawn, a golden flower in a meadow. Rise up from the oars, bluebill, ascend from the paddles, dear duck Rise up without lifting, ascend without elevating Advance along this reckless road, the ground prepared for you The carefully groomed courtyards, evened out especially Put your foot up on the step, then proceed to move indoors Under the handsome ridgepole, this beautiful canopy! Rise up from the oars, bluebill, ascend from the paddles, dear duck Rise up without lifting, ascend without elevating Greetings and God bless you, everyone under this ridgepole. Under this beautiful canopy. Greetings to you, and welcome to our home! This humble house of ours, this petty room of pinewood. A fine ale, tasty drink, malty beverage to my liking. A man should not drink in vain, he should sing, too. Oh, wise Väinämöinen, ancient and famous singer. Please pick up your instrument, play us your harp. Groom, be thankful for your fortune for this good woman you have met Your maker promised you a good one gave you one in all his grace, too This duckling is pretty at sea, yet even prettier by your side A star shines brightly in the sky yet more brightly on your finger Please give us, dear God another day; oh Lord For us to live here in peace and keep working our good deeds I wish we could play all day and be merry in the evening in this stead we call our own In Kalevala and its courtyards Eternal night has come, a lasting period of darkness. - Our feast was abruptly ended. - Let the banquet continue later. This is a serious matter. Let us go and see. Oh, poor me. There is no joy under the sky, no reason to play the harp, with no daylight to be had, no sunlight shining on our heads. I shall make the winds blow, make a tempest rage in turmoil! Freeze the marshes, freeze the lands! Cover the canopies with snow, knock down the people of Kalevala! Slay them and their devious kin. No more shall our swan be singing to poor people ridden with frost. Death will soon come, our demise is approaching. We will all freeze to death here. Light up the room for a moment, dear candle. So that I may take one more look at you and your pretty eyes. Are they blue or red? Or white as a sheet? - Get up, Ilmarinen! - There is no life without the sun. Forge us another day up there to the top of the sky. You have forged the heavens, too! I think I might forge the day. - What are you forging in your smithy? - A new halo for the sun. Day cannot be made in a smithy. Let us go to Northland and release the day once more. Rise up with your swords, men! Everyone to your blades! A sword cannot touch the evil, a blade violate the villains. Something else is needed. The magic of marvellous music. We shall go with harps in our hands. How do we implement the instruments? Construct the harps? There are plenty of pines standing on our hills. Strike the wood with your axes, carve it with your hatchets. Bring all the ships here. Gather our wooden vessels. Bring all your gold here. All you shining silver, too. That will make the strings for our harps to make sounds of eternal joy. The piece of Sampo's heart, fly to the top of the sky. Move like an arrow of blue, twinkle like a spark of fire. Come and see this, wizards. What is this strange phenomenon? - It is the swordsmen of Kalevala. They shall come in hundreds, thousands even. What are they holding in their hands? Harps, I reckon? They come here to dance, in need of a jolly frolic. Death to the intruders! May demise meet the haughty steeds in the freezing embrace of the lake. In the frosty womb of the snow. Put your hands on your ears, so you cannot hear the strange music. Strike them all down! With steel-tip arrows and spears of copper. Rise up, you wind! Turn into a terrible tempest! Turn into a terrible tempest. Fly, fly, my cloak! Hurtle away, dear cloth! Strangle these men by their throats! Now, Lemminkäinen. Release the daylight from the rock! Soon you will rise again, sun! Beautiful day rise from the rock! Greetings, day; for shining so bright, dear sun for rising so high. Give us happiness henceforth, to live life in peace and harmony. In this stead we call our own, on the plains of Kalevala.
