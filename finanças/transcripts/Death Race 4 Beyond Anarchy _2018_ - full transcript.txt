My son's story begins in the ocean. A place full of secrets. Some are beautiful, some are dangerous. Its mysteries have baffled mankind for centuries. None were solved in the Bermuda Triangle. But in order to understand the Triangle, you must understand my son. Although he lives among you, he was born in the darkest reaches of the sea. I hoped to teach him the ways of the world. How to live a good life and become a good man. But then... I was taken from him. Turtle 1, Turtle 1. Tempest Key coast guard to Turtle 1. Atlanna, you're out there? Flying high and free. All the hatcheries were undisturbed. You missed me? More than I can say on an open frequency. How's your new research assistant paying out? He's got something to tell you. Dad, Mum let me touch this big old sea turtle. It was the coolest thing ever! And Dad, I hold my breath underwater for almost five minutes! Hey, that is incredible, kiddo. I swear, you must be part of fish. Hey, we're less than an hour away. Wanna grab a pizza and meet us? Tom? Tom, can you read me? Oh, my God. Atlanna, sweetheart, I lost you. Atlanna? Arthur, back off. Honey, get your seat. O'Hara, we got a storm brewing out there? No, sir. Blue skies for 500 miles. Hold on. Mommy! Mommy help me! Mommy! Mommy help me! I'm stuck. I can't get out. They're coming for you. You have to get to the surface. Do good with your life. I will find you again, I promise. I love you, Oren. Mommy? Mom!!! Morning, AC. You had a busy night. Come on, get out of here. What did I do this time, sheriff? Oh, it depends on where you were at ten o'clock last night. I don't wear a watch. I can't tell you. Then didn't you break into Neptune World and free five dolphins? - I'm the wrong man. - Is that so? All right.... How do you explain these Kodak moments? Sir, come on. Any ten year old with a PC could have photoshoped those pictures. Come on, AC. Look, you're under arrest for breaking and entering and animal endangerment. Endangerment? Come on, I've seen port-a-potties that were cleaner than this theme park. I was doing of those dolphins a favour. Yeah, the world is full of misunderstood heroes. Come on. Thanks for bailing me out, Dad. Promise I'll pay you back. AC, I know your heart is in the right place, but come on, this is the third time this year. Well I guess this is the day when you wish you never would have signed those adoption papers. - Hey, kiddo. No matter how many times you screw up, and you're definitely going for the record here, I'll always be your father. All right, I gotta go to work. You know, it's ten years today since Mom disappeared. AC, please, don't. Don't do this to yourself. We were flying over the Bermuda Triangle. She called me Oren. She said she had so much to tell me. Didn't she also said do good with your life? I don't see you fixated on that. You should be in Stanford right now, not worrying about being incarcerated. I'm not leaving Tempest Key until I find out what happened to Mom. Look, I missed her too. But you're not a teenage anymore. You have so much potential. I hate to see you go to waste. Look I've messed up. I'm sorry. If you're really sorry... pull your life together, kiddo. I'll see you later. Rough night? No... No, that's fine. But this day keep sucking more and more by the minute. Why are you putting a 'for sale' sign on my boat? Technically, the boat's still mine. I figured it was time for me to cut my losses. Eva. I know you are mad about the chargers I blew off this morning. You know, there's something ironic about watching five cardiologists have a heart attack when you tell them their diving instructor is in jail. See, uh, technically, it was a holding cell and the plan was not to get arrested. You know, that's what you said when you swam aboard the cruise ship and run out the bar tab. It was a wedding. You know, I got caught up in the moment. I've run everyone around. And for the record, the bridesmaid did say that my toast was incredibly romantic. Well, maybe one of them should have wired you the money to cover the bill. You're not really gonna sell my boat, are you? AC, come on, we're supposed to be business partners. Why did you pick last night to go Greenpeace on me? You wanna know the real reason why I freed those dolphins? It's because I felt like they were calling to me. So what do you say, you can talk to fish now? Dolphins are mammals and... No, it was more they, uh... Weird empathy... If you want, I can call a friend over dolphin rescue and we can set up a legal defence fund. Ok... Ok. Thanks. Don't worry. And get to work. Gettin' tired of staring at these bottles. Anyone around here wanna afford me a drink? Little early for happy hour, don't you think? You're Tom Curry's boy. I've seen you diving Mercy Reef. Then I realize I have a fan club. You don't. You're in the lighthouse on endless point. Goals of nothing on my view. Sounds beautiful. I remember the day your mother's plane went down. That cloudless Caribbean sky. God couldn't have painted a prettier picture. Then out of nowhere came the storm. I'm sorry, who are you? Name's McCaffery. Keep the change. Arthur... If you look hard and long enough into the deep, something is going to start looking back. Watch yourself. This is cost guard rescue. We have a possible shipwreck victim. This is cost guard rescue. We got an unidentified male, mid-20s. He's hypothermic. - Pupils aren't responding. They're coming. I mu- must warn Oren. Take it easy, buddy. Take it easy. We're taking you to the hospital. This is unit 66. We are on route to Mercy Reef hospital. Don't forget to take left to Cuba, Torres. You think I'm taking directions from you, Munts? You'd get lost in a two lane highway. - Lieutenant Torres. - Commander Daley. You've got a new mission. Coordinates are in your NavCom. You're flying over Mercy Reef. Permission to speak freely. Go ahead. Sir, if you're giving me an easier assignment because you don't believe I can handle the rigours of this program you're a 100%-- This is not the LPGA, Torres. You tee off with the men. These orders come from way above my head. Told me to put my best pilot on it. Needed a clean sweep of the area. Now, about blowing up sunshine every backside, you're ready to fly? - Yes, sir. - Good. Now, the coast guards pulled a John Doe off the reef. No boat, no ID and no idea where he came from. ****** up the food chain. If you see anything out of the ordinary, you let me know. Lieutenant Torres reporting as ordered. I'm flying over Mercy Reef, there's nothing out here, guys. Wait a second, something below the surface is following me. It's coming on fast. Hang on, it just dropped back. I'm gonna circle around. There's a disturbance in the ocean! There's a light, it--! - It's you... - Welcome back. Doctors said I could wait here until you woke up. I hope the Navy doesn't have a "You break it, you bought it" policy. Remember anything? Just a flash of light. Then I was flying through the water. And you were carrying me. And we were going so fast. You know, when you're drowning, uh..., your brain misses oxygen and you start to see things that aren't real. Maybe you should rest. Is that your way of saying that I'm crazy? Your plane crashed at 700 miles an hour. So I'm gonna reserve judgment until the painkillers wear off. I better go tell the nurse that you're awake. Wait. What's your name? It's not important. You saved my life. It's important to me. AC. Oren? They know you're here. They know you survived. Why did you call me that? Where did you get this necklace? They're coming... for you. - Who are you? - Visiting hours are over. Who the hell are you? This badge means I'm the only one asking questions. Where are you taking him? I said where are you taking him? I asked you a question! Where are you taking him? We got him. When did he wake up? Five minutes ago. Is he displaying any violent tendencies like the others? No, Sir... This is the file you requested from the NAVY archives. The dental records match our John Doe. Hansen Gus Thompson. Member of flight 19 who disappeared December 5th, 1945... Bermuda Triangle. Welcome home Hansen Thompson. Where the hell have you been for the last 60 years? Just tell him that called his son, it's about the man he pulled off Mercy Reef this morning. ...this bitch. I tell you that I got the perfect spot in the house for the lady. Right above.... Easy. I've already told them to dock some place else and I'll report the boat tomorrow to the Fish and Wildlife. Fines not gonna stop these guys. I just gonna go remind them about the catch and release policy of marlin. AC, kicking the crap out of a bunch of fishermen is only gonna lead you back in jail. Okay? It's amazing how cruel people can be. Yeah... It bothers me more and more. That marlin should be in the ocean and not hanging at some moron's fireplace. Maybe some day, the fish will get their revenge. I don't know, I think rednecks make pretty ugly trophies. I'm Nadia. I heard you're pretty amazing under the water. If you would like to take me diving, I'm free tomorrow. I was hoping we could do something... - Great idea. - Let's go for a swim. - You just read out my mind. You're not bad under the water yourself. Years of practice. You know, we met a long time ago. Are you sure about that? I would definitely have remembered you. Let me refresh your memory. Nadia? Ok, you're already starting to freak me out here. Nadia? I hate those damn things. What the hell was she? Get your clothes on. We need to talk. Once a siren has you in her game, there's nothing a man can do. Siren? Of course. You act like you see them all the time. I've seen my fair share. Unfortunately my hands are a little rusty. The only way to kill those scary bitches is to nail them between the eyes. Who are you? An exiled like you and your mother. Exiled from where? It's called different names by different cultures. You probably know it by its most famous. Atlantis. Atlantis? Next time you're in Atlantis, could you say Hi to Captain Nemo and the Little Mermaid for me? You think I wanted to be the one to tell you? No, I think you need to lay off the booze, old man. It's pickled your brain. You can't run away from you true calling, Oren. So let me get this straight... My parents were the rulers of Atlantis. So I guess, technically, that would make me... A prince. You know, the fact that you can say that with a straight face is impressive. Let me ask you a question. Does Atlantis have a retractable dome? Or does everyone just, swim around in there like a bunch of fish? Don't mock me. You think I don't know how absurd this sounds? But you saw that siren. Was that a joke? Okay, so if Atlantis exists... then how come no sub sonar or deep sea probe has been able to discover it, huh? because it's cloaked in a shroud no modern technology can penetrate. The Bermuda Triangle. Your father was a man of peace. They were others who wanted to wage war against the surface world. Your father resisted. So what? They killed him? And now they want me dead too. I managed to get you and your mother out. Knew the only place you would be safe was up here. You were found on Mercy Reef by a young coast guard Lieutenant. My dad. Then he knows. No. Your mother insisted that we said nothing. She probably thought she could hide you from you true destiny. Yeah, and what's my true destiny, huh? To defend this world you've embraced as your own and protect the ocean from which you were born. So you want me to fight sirens and Standard Oil? Is that it? You know what? Forget it. Find somebody else. I'm not interested. You can't avoid your responsibility, Oren. It's in your bones and you know it. This is insane. I'm a dive shop owner. I'm not the protector of the Seven Seas. Destiny is like a riptide. You never know it's pulling you in until it's too late. So this girl, Nadia, is actually a killer mermaid who wants to take you out because you're some sort of under water royalty? I'm quite sure, yeah. Well, they all look so funny on the Starbucks cups. Well, I didn't believe it either until that siren tried to kill me. She's coming back for me. Then I suggest a road trip to the desert with a truck full of Evian. Eva. I think she is the creature that attacked my mom. I have to face her. You're really serious about this. You should close up for a couple of days... Head out of town. I don't want you caught in the middle of this. And what about you? I'm taking the Quint to Atlas Point. McCaffery got weapons there. Well, it looks like a storm is coming anyway. Maybe I'll go and visit my sister in Tampa. Look, I'm sorry about all this insanity. Yeah, well, being friends with you's always required a leap of faith. Besides, some day you'll make it up to me, give me a cool title like... "Duchess of the Deep". I don't know how you escaped from Atlantis. But thank you for leading me to Oren. It's good to see you back on your feet, Lieutenant Torres. Thank you, sir. But I'm confused. I already went over the accident report with Commander Daley. I understand that but I'm the one who ordered the mission. I wanted to debrief you myself. And who exactly do you work for? Top dog, lieutenant. Commander in Chief. I was curious about that flash of light that you saw right before you lost control. To be honest sir, I was disoriented. It could've been a sun flare. You wanna placate me. I won't think you lost your mind. After all, you were flying over the Bermuda Triangle. With all due respect, sir, that's just a myth. I used to share that sentiment. What changed your mind? Why don't I show you? Last year, this man boarded an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico and attempted to blow it sky high. He was killed before he succeeded. His name was Evan Corday. He disappeared, along with his yacht, off the coast of Bermuda on July 6th 1905. It's impossible. It must have been a descendant or somebody who looks like him. I'd agree with you, except that the fingerprints were a perfect match. And he's not the first one to come back. Come back from where? That's what project Novas aims to find out. I want you to join us, Lieutenant. Help unlock the mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle. Sir, I'm a pilot... I don't know really of any experience I could offer. You have more experience than any of us. You witnessed something extraordinary out there and you lived to tell the tale. I don't believe a pilot with your impeccable record can be taken out of the sky by a sun flare or a freak mechanical failure, Lieutenant. Sir, I joined up to fly jets and serve my country. Not chase windmills. This is not a fool's crusade. This is a matter of national security. All these files contain pictures of people who vanished in the Bermuda Triangle. They are MIA's in an invisible war. And Tempest Key is the front line. Yeah? I'll be right there. If you want to see how real this is come with me Lieutenant. Eva you need to hit the road or you're never gonna make it out of here before the storm. Once it's locked down, I'll go. I don't want to come back and find half our restaurant under water. I got it, I got it... So once you're taking care of business, uh... we should talk to the bank about a lender upgrade to your boat. Oh, great. Power line's blown over. No, it must be the circuit breaker. Light is still on at Captain Jack's. Are you sure you know what you're doing? Yeah, trust me. Would it kill you to hold the flash light steady? It's very funny, Eva. Good night forever, Oren. Eva. Sorry about your friend. But I'm more concerned about your life now. McCaffery... She got you, too? Where is she taking us? Home. To Atlantis. To be executed. Why haven't she got us already? You're a symbol of hope, Oren. If they kill you... that hope dies too. - I need water. - My flask, it's in my boot. Smash it! - How do we take her down? - We aren¡t doing anything. You're getting off this boat. No! No! That thing took my mom and attacked my friend. I'm not going anywhere until she's dead. I promised your father on his dying breath I will protect you. I'm not breaking my word now. Do you have any weapons? Nadia! Your aim's got better. - Where is Oren? - Rot in hell you jelly bitch! Now... Where is Oren? I'm right here. Your mother can't protect you this time. What did you do to her? You'll find out. You're coming home, Oren. Oren? No! Well done, Oren. Your father would have been proud. I'm sorry, Eva. How much do you remember, Lieutenant Torres? You know, that siren was just the beginning. There are creatures in the deep you couldn't imagine in your worst nightmares. Oh, that's reassuring. Thanks a lot. I'm not here to make you feel good. I'm here to prepare you for the worst. Look, we should've started your training years ago. Then let's do it. Let's start now. I'm ready. A birthday gift. I kind of feel it's like a book. I'm not really much a reader. Just open it. Henry the 4th : Parts 1 and 2. I didn't really know Shakespeare was in sequence. I expect for you to read them by next week. I gave up book reports in sixth grade. This is a part of your training. Right, see, when you said training, I thought you meant, you know, wielding tridents, and doing cool stuff in the water. All in due time. Don't worry, there's plenty of sex and violence in there that'll keep you interested. Could you just say the highlights? And tell me how it ends? The lesson isn't in the ending, Oren. It's in the journey.
