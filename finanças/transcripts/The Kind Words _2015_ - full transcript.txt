I brought you a present so you'll look respectable. I told you I'd do it. Are you sure? Do you know how many couples are waiting? There's no turning back, Dorona. You'll lose your place. Child Services Dorona and Ricky Cohen - May I ask why? - No. Why? - I told you not to ask why. - But why? Because. I'll be waiting downstairs. What's with her? We had another miscarriage two weeks ago. She's been staying with her mother. I didn't know you were still trying. Neither did I. Does this mean you're separated? That's a shame. Give me two weeks, Efrat. I'll convince her. Please, just two or three weeks. I don't know why I thought talking to you would help. Some help! Like an idiot I try: "Bless me... May it be your will... " " Lord hear my prayer..." All that bullshit. But all you do God, is sit up there and ignore me. You're probably saving your time for more worthy people than me, right?! But look at him. You could have helped me for his sake. At least tell me when you're coming home-. I don't get it, Dorona. Do you want a divorce? - That's not what I said. - Then what do you want? Stop bugging me, "What do you want?" "What do you want?" - I don't want to argue any more, Ricky. - Okay, fine. Go. I'll find someone else in no time. - Good luck. - Someone normal, unlike you. Sorry. Good question, what do I want... One thing's tor sure, this is my last conversation with you, get it, God? No more “In your grace... in Your mercy...“ I'm done with that! From now on, silence. From now on, I'll think. Maybe in the end I'll understand something. (“B" Language) I-bi lo-bove (I love you) I-bi lo-bove you-bou... Come exercise with me-. First change this annoying song. There are other songs, you know. Mom, what's with your belly? - What? - It's swollen like a watermelon. How long's it been like that? - A month, I guess... - Have you seen a doctor? What for? So he can tell me to go on a diet? You only just noticed? - What do you want from me? - You're always here. - Maybe she's pregnant. - Don't be a clown. If you ever looked at anyone beside yourself... Natanel, don't piss me off. What are you whispering about? - You told them. - Mom, you can't hide that watermelon. I-bi a-basked you-bou no-bot to-bou te-bell. (I asked you not to tell) They-bey no-bo-ti-biced. (They noticed.) What can I do? I'm very angry with you- - Be angry- We have to pray, although with a tumor that size it's hard to believe - there won't be metastases. - Excuse me. But there's nothing we can do but rush her to the table... cut her open and take it out. Pardon me for asking, Doctor, are you a vet? - Excuse me? - Judging by your gestures you're about to operate on a cow. He could explain without making us panic. Hello? Great. Not only is he an Arab, now you've destroyed his morale. It's all Dad's fault. - What's so funny? - Your tragic look. He dumped you like a dog. Don't pretend it doesn't hurt. What are you doing here? After my operation you're going back to work at the restaurant and home to Ricky. To hell with that shitty restaurant. Do-bon't ta-balk li-bike tha-bat. (Don't talk like that) Cut the “B" Language, I'm not a baby. Really? Then why aren't you at home with your husband? - You want me to go? - Yes. Fine. Go live your life. I don't need a babysitter. Can you turn the computer on? I have to talk to Aunt Rosa. Coming with your foot like that? Are you crazy? - Then wait for me. - She's lost her mind-. Forget it, Rosa. My kids are here. It's just an operation. - Dorona, take care of your mom for me. - Fine. If she doesn't stop whining I'll break her other foot. Don't cry, Rosa. Have a drink. - It's water. - Sure it's water. I can smell it from here. - Look at him sitting there like a cat. - I think it's nice oi him to come. - Whatever... - How many sandwiches did you make? Say the blessing, don't get Mom in trouble. You'll be called shortly. What are they doing to her, writing a thesis? All this renovation work, what morons. I said the blessing silently, pest. Here comes the singer. What nerve. A. - Stop. - P. Panama. I'm giving him a sandwich. - Who? - Him. Forget it. We're pigging out here, it's not nice. - What is it? - Pastrami. Thanks. Dorona, I have to talk to you. I was just being polite, I don't intend to talk to you. - You've gone way too far. - Really? I've been trying to talk to you for a month. It's important. Good for you. - Are you stalking me? - It's a public place. How dare you show your face here? You have to talk to your dad. It's important. You aren't leaving before you promise to talk to him. Let me go, Osnat. I have to deal with my mother. It's just an operation. Why won't you talk to him? Move. - Put down the spatula. - Move or I'll operate on your ugly face. Don't try me. - Your turn. - Did she say anything about me? - She told us to take care of you. - Why, am I a retard? - Where's Ricky? Outside? - No. Isn't he coming to say hello? Mom, it's just an operation. You aren't going to die. Why are you always scratching? - Do you have lice? - What? Lice. The hospital's crawling with them. - Let me see your head. - Why? - I want to see if you have lice. - Now? It's nobody's fault that it isn't working-. - Don't be so angry. - What's that got to do with anything? - You're still young. - Do I have lice? How can you see without your glasses? - You can always adopt. - Enough, Mom. You could help all those poor people. Do you know how many orphans are wandering around India? - You want me to adopt an Indian? - Why not? Go there, travel a little, and buy one. What is it, a rug? - It'll cost a few pennies. - Okay, fine. It's best to buy a girl. You've lost your mind. You'll braid her hair so she won't get lice at preschool. Mom, it's only an operation. I hurt for you. All your pregnancies, It hurts me to see you give up-. My-by Do-bo-ro-bon. (my Dorona) Don't cry, my love. I don't like it when you call me Doborobon. Why-by no-bot? (Why not?) - Be-be-cau-bause (Because.) Go call your father. I know he's outside. - Go call him in. - Why? Because I'm asking you to. He's your father, like it or not. I'm not mad at him, you shouldn't be either. How long have you been here? Was my mouth open? I've seen you sleep with your mouth open. Did you find someone normal yet? How's your mom? They put her to sleep. She's in pain. We have to pray there aren't any complications. They operated on her for 7 hours. That won't help, the stupid TV goes on by itself. I told your dad I'm leaving when the renovation's done. I know it bothers you that I still work with him. - It doesn't bother me. - Yeah, sure. - Work with whoever you want. - I want you. I want our own place, not some lousy cafeteria. - Where? - Amuka. - What's Amuka? - In the Galilee. I know where Amuka is. Why go there? Quality of life. And you hate Jerusalem. Me? Since when? Shut up, damn it! Ricky, I'm in the hospital with my mother. This is no game. Have you eaten? Shut up and come with me. - Where? - To talk to your dad. I'm going to sleep. Bought a new one in my honor? Don't try me, Dorona. Come along quietly or I'll slice you. I'll make a barbecue out of your poodle face. Where'd you get the spatula? - I bought it for your dad, for the renovations. - I see. You went shopping and suddenly decided to kidnap me? I didn't plan to. Put it back in your bag. How did they let you in with that? I'm a famous singer. They don't search me. A lousy singer who sings ancient songs. You're just jealous. - Are you in on this too? - In on what? - Her Operation Entebbe. - At least you came. Now you can talk to her. I didn't come, I was kidnapped at spatula-point. Wait till the police come for you. We'll see how you sing in jail. So what do you want? I need some sleep before I take over for Shai. My mom's in intensive care, if you don't mind. Your mom is fine. I spoke to the doctor, the operation went well. She'll have a few tough days. Let's hope for the best. She's a strong woman. Have a seat. This won't be easy for either of us. Osnat and I are trying to have a baby. - Dorona, please listen. - Sorry, but if you think I want to hear about your sex life you're mistaken. Osnat is my wife, like it or not. I love her. She's young, she wants to be a mother. You of all people can relate to that. Bottom line, it isn't working. - We had all the tests done and Osnat is fine. - So? I have a problem. It's a freak of nature. My body doesn't manufacture sperm. It never did and it never will. What do you want, my pity? Is that why you called me? What time is it, anyway? Great, now my battery's dead. I have to go to the hospital. I didn't sleep a wink, thanks to you. What does this mean? I don't know. - What does it mean about us? - I don't know. Does Ricky know? That's impossible. It must have happened over the years. Maybe she damaged you. - Do you know what your blood type is? - No. I do. It's AB. - So? - Your mother and I are type B. What do I know about it? I flunked biology. It's not biology, it's a fact. And you only found out now? Who thinks of such things? Even you don't know your blood type. And Natanel and Shai? Them too? Excuse me, ma'am. Your purse. You let someone in with a spatula like a machete and you're checking me? Are you Mrs. Baruch's daughter? Please accept my deepest condolences. The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. That's life, it sneaks up from behind and now you have to deal with all the crap. That's why we're here, to make it easier. We arrange the entire funeral. Catering for the mourning period, drinks for the mourners. Special deal, three installments. What are you talking about? - Don't you... - Don't I what? I'm sorry, I thought you... I'm sorry, really. Wait! Somewhere deep within us lie voices and memories. Many sights that we've forgotten, tales of wonder and melodies...... Don't blame yourself, it was a blood clot. It would've happened even if you were with her. I don't blame myself, don't worry. What did you talk to her about in the hospital? Did you ask about that nonsense? What'd she say? Nothing. All the memories of long ago, the first dreams. And every word of Dad and Mom spoken years ago... Make sure you wash off all the impurity- - We will. Okay, honey? Ricky, I don't want you to stay with us. Just come visit once in a while, okay? Please don't make faces. I need to be alone with my brothers. I don't know how to tell them. They'll fall apart on me. I can help. You can help make sure my dad stays away. It's best for all of us, him, too. And sometimes the remnant of a scent or a familiar sound or word Brings back a blossoming garden, sends you back to the starting point... - Sorry for your loss. - Thank you. - I loved her so much. - Thank you. - I'm sorry. - Thank you. - Hey. - Hey. - Be strong. - Thanks for coming. Sure. What's he doing here? Didn't they break up? Two months ago. Chill. Tell him to go. This is a mourning, not a nightclub. - You tell him. - I will. Don't you dare insult him. - Want me to cancel my trip? - No, I'm fine. I just hope they don't fall apart on me. - Thanks. - For what? For coming. Honey, we discussed this. Just come tomorrow and help with lunch. I keep my nose out of Dorona's business. I'm afraid she'll hit me. It's time to go. Come on, honey. I'll drive you home and come back. I don't want to leave them alone-They'll fall apart on me-. It's ok, I'll close the door. - Were you smoking? - No. Liar. Give me one. - Where's the pack from? - They're Mom's. Once a week, Saturday morning, with a shot of arak. - Mom smoked on Sabbath? - Where did you come from? She promised not to smoke on Saturdays. - It's cold. - Did you take them home? Kobi has an ear infection. They don't need to be here. - Where's your pervert friend? - Stop it, Natanel. On the way to Frankfurt. - Really? Is he a flight attendant? - No, he's a lawyer. Why? I thought you were all flight attendants. Cavemen are less primitive than you. I'm not a flight attendant. You're not like that, you just got swept away. I hope you're not back together. Shut up, both of you. I haven't slept a wink in four days. I'm going to shower and then I have to talk to you. - About what? - You can't shower. - Why not? - You're in mourning. It's forbidden! You can stink as much as you want. I'm going to shower. Give her a break, okay? Why don't you shower, too? I promise I won't tell Raziya. And Dad knew all these years? I told you, they only just got tested, he just found out-. How can that be? What did... Mom... How? What did she do when... I don't know, and it won't help to ask. I never cease to be amazed at how little I know that loser who calls himself Dad. And you believe his crap? He makes up bullshit to get us off his back forever, blood tests, my ass. He should get an Oscar for his performances. A Pulitzer Prize for a sick mind, the scumbag. We have to get the house ready tor tomorrow's guests. I need pictures of Mom. I don't have time for his crap. - You think he made it up? - I don't care. - Why would he? - Wait, what does it mean? That I'm a bastard? If Raziya's parents hear this they'll take her back to Brooklyn with the kids. I'm done for, don't you get it? Fuck! Why did she keep these marbles? What a moron! Did she expect me to play on her grave? Who saves marbles? Leave it, just go to sleep. I'll clean up, okay? Mom, what did you do? What are you all dressed up for? Get down from there, it's dangerous. From where? What are you talking about? Doborobon, don't ask me and I won't ask you. O-bo-kay-bay? (Okay?) No-bo. At least give me a hint-. You're not 5 years old any more. - Was that a hint? - Was that a hint? - Are you repeating what I say? - Are you repeating what I say? Do you know what this is? It's Dad's receipt books. You found Dad's stinginess collection. I thought Morn threw out that crap. Aren't you starving? Are you telling me he wrote down all his expenses? It's from when he used to wake us up with a whistle. "Dad's inspection.“ Cheapskate. On July 12, 1980 you ate a Popsicle, Dorona-. Look. “Popeye Popsicle for Dorona, 40 agorot.“ What's a Popeye Popsicle? I'm glad you've calmed down. You had me worried with your freak-out-. What? You look nice in those undies. Surprising. Did you think I sleep in a suit? You have a cute ass. - God help you with that sinful talk... - Why sinful? Maybe we don't have the same father? Who knows, maybe we have a different mother. Maybe you came out of thin air like Jesus. But if I had to choose, I prefer you. You're sexier than him, too bad you're gay. Look. He stopped keeping track 6 months after I was born. So what? Why did he stop? Did he stop spending? Maybe he was fed up- - Right-I was born and he got fed up-. You aren't so special- He's fed up with all of us-. I have to talk to my son. Say “Daddy", Yarivi. Yarivi, say “Daddy.“ "Daddy-". He's a night owl, like me. What? Who's a cutie? Who's a cutie? Who's beautiful? Why don't you bring him here? He's growing up in exile. - He's with his mom in Budapest. - Where's Budapest, in the Negev? She's in school there, pest. If you married her she wouldn't have left. But like an idiot you told her you're bi. - 'Cause I'm not a liar. - "Bi“ my ass There's no such thing as bi. What is it, a bivalve? What are you, an oyster? Go ahead and laugh. Budapest... Everyone there is anti-Semitic. - They closed them. - Closed what? The concentration camps, didn't you hear? Just you wait, what was, shall be again and there's nothing new under the sun. - Hello. - Hello. Your dad sent this. There are two more crates outside. Did you tell them? He knows, too? You know, too? I'm done for. - He wants to talk to you. - Big deal. Have you considered how he feels? A guy raises three kids and 30 years later he finds out he's not their father. Stop being his lackey, Ricky. It's his fault that my mom's dead. He paid the surgeon $3,000 under the table - to make sure she'd be okay. - Oh, yeah? - The Arab took a bribe. - How do you know? He told me- - You believe all his 1001 Nights stories? He's waiting outside. Really? Why doesn't he come in? Natanel! Wait! Natanel! See? I told you not to come. "...beyond any blessing, song, praise or consolation "uttered in this world, and let us say Amen." - Amen. "May there be great peace from Heaven, "life, bounty, salvation, comfort, health, “forgiveness, abundance and deliverance, for us and all Israel "and let us say amen." - Amen. "May He who makes peace in His Heaven make peace upon us and upon all Israel, "and let us say amen." - Amen. Thanks, honey. Not a word to Raziya. Okay, honey. If you ask me, Mom was a spy. She grew up in Algeria, right? - And she visited Aunt Rosa in Paris once a year? - Yeah. She met an Algerian spy there who she knew from childhood and brought the secrets to Dad. Do the math. Dad was in Intelligence. - He was a cook in Intelligence. - That was his cover story. So the Algerian spy got her pregnant? - Maybe he was an Arab. - God forbid. Maybe she was the spy. Or a murderer. Ever see her kitchen cleaver? - I know. She was a Nazi hunter. - What? Then why did she take us on a heritage tour of Oschwitz? Since when did she have family in Oschwitz? It was an educational tour. We're Jews. Unless your father is a little Arab spy, - which makes you... - Shut up. And what's “Oschwitz”? The word is Auschwitz. Oschwitz, Auschwitz, it's the same crap. Stop it. - Where to? - To sleep. - Dad's inspection. - What? I cracked the case. I spent all night with this garbage. The delightful record of an obsessive cheapskate, but it's also the entire history of this family, - before I was born, of course. - Where did you find Dad's whistle? Don't interrupt. Okay, as we all know, Mom and Dad got married in 1965. Morn was 19, and that's when Dad started keeping records, right? You, Natanel, were born in 1976 and Dad bought a stroller. So? It took them 11 years to have their first child. So what? We know that. Look. Exactly 9 months before Natanel was born it says: "June 23, 1975, plane tickets to Paris for Yonah, "1,400 liras" What's your point? - She visited Aunt Rosa every year. - Right. 9 months before you were born, 9 months before Dorona was born, and 9 months before I was born. What does it mean? I thought you didn't believe him. You convinced me it was all baloney and now what are you saying? That Morn went to Paris in order to get pregnant? I'd better kill myself now. Maybe Dad and her jumped in bed every time she got back? That makes sense too, doesn't it? What did she do? Vacation. Just vacation? She'd show up at my house once a year and rest. - Did she have someone? - What? Did she see someone? How dare you?! Aunt Rosa, answer us. We just want to know if Mom had someone. Before or after Dad. - Why? - Because! Why can't just you tell us?! - Why are you shouting? - Because you annoy me! If she shouts I won't tell you anything, not about Algeria or anything. Algeria? What about Algeria? Did she have someone in Algeria? Did she go to Algeria? How? They wouldn't let an Israeli in. - Then what's in Algeria? - Nothing. But you just started to say something about Algeria. Nothing. We were kids in Algeria. I don't remember a thing. Everyone only asks about her. "Pretty Jonah, pretty Jonah." What about me? Why don't you ask about me? What if I'm sick? Are you sick? And where's your husband, Dorona? Why isn't he there? And why don't you let your father mourn with you? Was it nice of you to throw apples at him? Did you hear that? I'm going to bed. I'm going to shower. I'm going to die. What now? Nothing-Count me out-. I'm an orphan, I don't want to be a bastard, too. What's up? - Is Natanel here? - Yeah, over there. Do you always have to be late? I have a teachers' meeting. - You brought water from home? - Yeah. Happy? Watch what you breathe, the air here isn't kosher. Cut the religious crap, Natanel. What's with you and God, anyway? We know you love Miss Orthodox, does that mean you have to wear this costume for her? Yes, but you wouldn't understand since you only love yourself. - Witty! - Did you find work? No, and please don't bug me about it. Why don't you move back home? I swear to God, if you don't shut up... Don't take His name in vain! Let's not waste time. I have to open soon. - Are we watching a movie? - Patience. Recognize this picture? It's from when Morn took you to Paris. So what? We know the picture. Look carefully. See anything odd? - Is this a quiz? - Just play along. Who took the picture? Aunt Rosa, of course. This is from the same trip. Aunt Rosa just had the eye surgery that she still talks about. I don't think she went around taking pictures of you. Wow, Shai, James Bond has nothing on you. She reminds me of Stevie Wonder-. So who took this picture? I don't remember a thing. I was only five. Look. Whose bag is that next to Mom's, and whose hat is that? It's a man's hat. - Maybe Morn bought it for Dad. - Yeah, right. Anyway, this is what we have so far. 1. The picture. 2. Dates of Mom's trips. 3. Algeria - black hole. And, oi course, Aunt Rosa. She's obviously hiding something. The conclusion is: We have a father and we need to find him. And the conclusion is: There are pills, Shai, and you need to take them. “Have a father must find him!" Maybe you're right, maybe I'm nuts, but I can't sleep at night and you can't either. Don't pretend. What are you getting at, Shai? Tickets to Paris, voucher for a hotel on the Champs Elysees, inflatable pillow for the flight. Maps. Even new swimsuits. The hotel has a pool. You are nuts. He's nuts. We fly a week before Passover. - I can't. - You're on vacation from school and Dorona, you're free now anyway. - But... - I spoke to Raziya. You told Haziya?! I just told her it's a surprise for your birthday. She was thrilled. Where'd you get the money? It's all on me. - But... - None of your business, Dorona. I have the money and I want to do it. But what'll I eat there? You're looking at a nut and that's all you care about? I want to try and find him. Why? - What? - Nothing. - Where to? - Paris. He wanted to come. And you agreed? What did he tell you? Nothing, I swear. You have separate rooms. - And he speaks fluent French. - So do we. - Yeah, like morons. - Is he going to be with us the whole time? I'm going home. Shai got you business class? Why only you? Don't drink too much, your legs will swell. - When will you tell me what you did? - When will you tell me what you did? - Are you starting again?! - Are you starting again?! Why is Kobi screaming, honey? Then who is that, Yitzhak? Why are you crying, Yarivi? Your father called me. He said he might want to come too. Suddenly everyone's interested in me- I'm a celebrity-. It's all kosher, dear. Poor Jonah, my beautiful sister. She was better at everything else, but I could teach you how to cook! So what are you up to, Aunt Rosa? What can I do? I teach Hebrew. Besides your leg, are you feeling better? Why? - Are you better? - What do you mean? He's asking if you're better. You said you were sick. - Me, sick? - Aren't you sick? I'm as healthy as a horse. This is in Paris. You came to visit, remember? Your mother came every year. Do you know where in Paris? - Do you remember? - How? I was only five. Then how should I remember? Take a look, Aunt Rosa. On the bench, next to Mom's purse... - Yes? - There's a man's bag and hat. So what? Lots of men in Marseille wear hats. Marseille? When were we in Marseille? What do you mean, Marseille? I told you, this is Paris. You just said Marseille. I made a mistake, so what? I'm not feeling well. - Just tell us who took the picture. - I did! Don't be angry, Aunt Rosa. When Morn and Dorona came you'd just had surgery. You couldn't have taken it. What surgery? - Eye surgery. - Oh... But that wasn't then. I'm telling you, I took the picture. Then your mom photographed me with Doborobon-. I'll show you. - What? - Your whole hat theory... I feel like an idiot. Why does she call me Doborobon? It's been half an hour. She fell asleep. Check her, maybe she's dead. She drank too much, that's all. Oh, yeah? What about Marseille? When will you realize nothing's going on... Too much garlic... Let's give her a few days and then, Shai, you go talk to her. We stressed her out. You mean I stressed her out? - I didn't say that. - Then why did you look at me? Butt out. Who asked you? You're right. - Ricky, what are you doing? - Going to have some fun. How did you know my size? I asked Ricky. You're tough on him. I didn't tell him to come, and you butt out. Did he cheat on you? - Did he hit you? - Are you crazy? Then what is it? You're just like Aunt Rosa, always hiding things. That's right, like the adoption thing. You even hid it from Morn. Why can't you share? - None of your business. - We can help. How? You want to be a surrogate mother? You're such a hypocrite. You didn't tell me about Amiri. What's that got to do with it? The difference between us is that I don't bug you. Hide as much as you like. No, Dorona, the difference between us is that Ricky is crazy about you, God knows why. Amiri, on the other hand, just doesn't love me. That's why he left. And yes, I'd love to be a surrogate mother for you if I could. Sure, sure. Look who's here, Elijah the Prophet. Raziya says it's okay. What? You could have asked what my size is. I asked Haziya. You can come in it's a public place. - Why did you come? - To the sauna? I'm cold. To Paris. Was it my brothers' idea? - Then why? - Because I love you. - Those are just words. - True, - but they're kind words. - For who? - You're so beautiful. - Yeah, sure. You're naked! So what? This is Europe. Everyone goes in the sauna naked. - You're crazy, you have an erection! - So? Someone could come in. I don't care- - Ricky, what is this? Sorry, I can't control it. I see you and I get a boner. How can I talk to you when your thingie is pointing at me? You don't have to look. I won't have sex with you now. Who asked you to? And I'm not getting pregnant anymore. Forget it. Why do you have to punish yourself? What are you guilty of? - Did you ever count how many pregnancies I've lost? - We've lost- I don't remember you ever being pregnant. What is this, a suffering contest? You don't know what it's like to give birth to a dead child. Ricky, I'm not pretending. I really don't want to adopt. I don't want to be the one who poisons your soul. You deserve Amuka. You deserve sex in a sauna with a normal woman. You deserve children. I can't raise a child I'm not sure I'll be able to love. What about me? Please go home. I'm not going. Why don't you pick up? - I thought it was... - Never mind. Dad's at Aunt Rosa's. She wants us to come. - What? - Dad is at Aunt Rosa's! - He came especially? Why? - How should I know? He isn't answering. Where is he? Ricky doesn't have to follow us everywhere. - What did Rosa say? - To come. You're more hysterical than her. - Hello. - Hello. Why didn't you invite me along? That was very unkind of you. You want to know who your father is. Good for you. Really. But I want to know, too. I want to know who raised you, who was with you all your lives. I won't hold you up. Have some tea and go. It seems Aunt Rosa has something to say that I thought you should hear. That's all. Rosa, where's the Sweet'N'Low? In the kitchen? I swore to Jonah. I have to pinch myself, I think I'm dreaming. Cut it out! It was in Algeria. That's where she met him. Met who? Maurice. He wasn't handsome, actually. He was thin, black as night, but she didn't care. A 16-year-old girl. Our father wanted to die when he found out. He made her life hell for a whole year. He locked her in her room so she'd jump out the window. Until they decided to run away. Only I knew where they were hiding. I was afraid for her sake so I told. That's the big secret? That Morn had a lover when she was 16? What was his name? Maurice? Maurice what? - Was he older than her? - No, he was just a boy. An orphan. They said he was a Communist. - That's why they kept them apart? - No. - Then why? - He was an Arab, I think. An Arab? - Are you sure? - I'm not sure about anything. Okay, what happened when they got caught? They sent her to Paris and made her have an abortion. Why? Was she pregnant? Why else? For fun? The very day they caught them, Papa sent her to Paris. And two months later we all left Algeria-. Things were bad enough for the Jews as it was. But Maurice didn't give up. He followed her to Paris. Finally they decided to send her to Israel because he couldn't go there. She went to the kibbutz where she met your father. And they never saw each other again? - I don't know. - When she came to visit. She came to rest and see me, that's all I know. And this Maurice, where is he? Did you know all this? Not until two hours ago. So why did you come here? To ask you to come home. Now that I've heard things that your mother never told me I'm begging you, come home. Live your lives. Honor your mother, she didn't want us to know. - Are you going home? - What do you care? Rosa, will you see me out? Regards to Ricky. I say we go home. You can go. I'm not leaving until we find this Maurice guy. You believe that old drunk's bullshit? One thing doesn't make sense, Aunt Rosa. You said you all moved to Paris, but Mom said your parents died back in Algeria. Papa died 12 years ago and Mama died two months later-. 12 years? We had grandparents until 12 years ago? Why didn't we meet them? Your mom shunned them until they died. She didn't speak to them, only to me. Aunt Rosa, where's Maurice? Please tell us. Do you know who Isabelle Moretti is? - The actress? - Yes. Talk to her. - What does she have to do with Maurice? - She knew him. Look her up and talk to her. This isn't Hollywood, she's just an actress-. Now leave me alone. Who are you talking about? Why should we talk to Moretti? Why can't you tell us? - I don't want to, okay? - Why not? Who are they talking about? About Madame Isabelle Moretti, no more and no less. - What's your problem? - Nothing. We start with Romeo and Juliet and end up with Isabelle Moretti. Suddenly Mom jumps out of windows, has abortions, she's a Communist. I don't know who you're talking about but it sure isn't my mother. And to top it off you invent grandparents. Great. You don't believe me. You've always envied her... Come with me. There you are, your grandparents. You're right, I did envy your mother. Too bad you didn't learn anything from her. Nothing but poison comes out of your mouth. Watch out or you'll end up like me. Okay, what do you want to know about Madame Isabelle Moretti? Is there a slideshow? Okay. "Isabelle Moretti, actress and producer, born 1946. "Her big break came...“ blah blah blah... "But first she took part in some underground productions "including the film 'The Desert of Tears'," and in parentheses: "The film was never completed-Director: Maurice L.“ And there's only one Maurice on earth, right? Let's see? What does the “L" stand for? Maybe he's Jewish. Maybe his name is Maurice Levi. - Maybe his name is Lobangulu. - Loban-what? Lobangulu, king of the Zulu, from Honolulu-. - What's with you? - Nothing. Just because Dad came all the way from Israel doesn't mean I believe that Morn had an affair with Muhammad Ali. No Maurice, no Boris, it's all bull. Are Mom's lies about Grandma and Grandpa bull, too? You're just afraid to find him. Okay, enough. Anyway, I left a message for Isabelle Moretti. We'll see if she calls back. I don't want to hear it. Shame on you! - Is this what you ordered, sir? - Yes. Thank you. I'm not staying with you. I'm finishing my apple and going home. Mom wanted to protect us, that's why she hid it. She was a wise woman, she realized our lives would be a nightmare if her secret came out. - What, that he's an Arab? - Exactly. You can play innocent and call me a racist and pretend you're from Mars, not from Jerusalem. And that you don't care it he's an Arab, - but it means something to me. - Me, too. But I want to see who he is. You don't have to be here. You only get in the way. - Shai, you're going too far. - You're right. I found what I'm looking for. I don't need this. - Are you implying something? - No, I'm saying it. How long can you blame Dad for your screwed-up life? And we're following you like idiots. Leave me alone, Shai- Go find your answers somewhere else-. Right, maybe I'll find God and eat apples. Maybe you should. - Is that your idea or did Haziya write it for you? - Watch your mouth. Don't you talk about Haziya. At least use a decent knife. What's wrong with you? Unbelievable. It's Isabelle Moretti. So answer already. Remember, only Ricky talks. She gave us exactly 15 minutes. - Hello. - Hello. Come in, you can leave the gate open. Are you the one I spoke to? - Are you Jonah's son? - No, I'm her daughter Dorona's husband. - Pleased to meet you. - Pleased to meet you. - And these are her sons, Natanel... - Pleased to meet you. Pardon me, I'm religious. - And Shai. - Pleased to meet you. At first I thought you were an Israeli producer, that's why I said I don't make movies there. I don't like the Mideast any more. Your smile looks like Jonah's. - Did you know her? - No, but Maurice showed me a photo once-. How is she? She died three weeks ago. I'm so sorry. I thought her children wanted to bring her and Maurice together but I guess that only happens in movies. Come. - Leon, Maurice Leon. - Leon? - Leon, Maurice Leon. - Leon? But he made up the name. I don't know what it was before. Some people called him Moussa and that annoyed him. You met him on the set? No, I met him at a little Algerian restaurant. Maurice studied at the Sorbonne and at night he made couscous. Strange guy, anarchist, atheist, and an excellent cook. We became friends and one day he told me his story. I don't know how we suddenly found ourselves working on a script. A sad love story. Like Romeo and Juliet, but in Algeria. Why didn't you finish the movie? It was a mistake to begin with. It was my idea that he direct it. I financed it, I recruited all our friends from the Sorbonne. You realize I was a little in love with him. I was young and he had a poetic soul. I thought if we made the film he'd love me as he loved your mother. That's the story. We barely managed to film two scenes-. Maurice became depressed, he didn't show up and everything stopped. Want to see? - See the film? - No, there's nothing left of it. But I have a few photos. Come. This is all that remains. Pictures, moments. If I'd known that 40 years later I'd meet the children of the woman I portrayed... Do you know where he is? Maurice? Why? Do you want to tell him that Jonah's dead? It'd kill him. If he's still alive he's probably in Marseille. The last time I saw him was in Marseille years ago. In a restaurant, of course. I actually remember the restaurant. "Beirut". Lebanese food, nice restaurant. But that was long ago. Do you have a picture of him? No, I threw it away. Or tore it up. You know how a broken heart is. You do all sorts of things that you regret later-. Be a little like me. How? I don't even know who you are. Just tell Ricky the truth. Get rid of the cigarette, there's no smoking here-. You talk to me about truth... Now you're a movie star. Te-bell Hi-bick-i-by the-be tru-buth. (Tell Ricky the Truth) And what about me? And what about me? And what about me? And what about me? And what about me? And what about me? And what about me? - And what about me? - And what about me? - And what about me? - And me as well, and me as well... The taxi's coming in 15 minutes. Where's Ricky? - He's meeting us in Marseille. - Why? He wanted to leave before us. Okay, Marseille. Second-biggest city in France, on the coast of the Mediterranean. Population: About a million and a half, among them 80,000 Jews. Not bad. - And about 300,000 Arabs. - We're going to Gaza... - Hey, Zinedine Zidane grew up in Marseille. - Who's that? What's that? “L decided to stay. Waiting for you at Rosa's till you calm down. Dad“ Him and his manipulations. What a pest. There's Ricky. - Beirut is gone. - What? - Beirut, the restaurant? - Yeah? New owners. It's called “Yizar“ - and it's a karaoke club. - Did you ask if Maurice works there? Not yet, but it's an Arab club, so Natanel, forget your disposable forks - and take off your skullcap. - Are you crazy? - Or wait in the hotel. - It's my right to wear it. - What's that got to do with it? - Don't shout. - I'm not shouting. - Yes, you are. Fine, I'm shouting. Happy? I know this music. Isn't this...? What is this place? Judging by the food, it's still a Lebanese restaurant-. Judging by the hairdos it's Yemenite. Israelis? - They're onto us. - Should I take it off? - You're paranoid. - So why are you whispering? Tel Aviv? Are you from Tel Aviv? - Jerusalem. - Why didn't you say so? Menashe! All Israelis are our guests. We'll treat you like kings. I'll get you drinks and we'll have a toast. What's going on here? - Hey, isn't this song... - "Abanibi". Right, by Yizhar Cohen. I-bi lo-bove (I love you) I-bi lo-bove you-bou... - Don't you get it? - What? The restaurant's called Yizar, Yizhar Cohen. There's a restaurant named after Yizhar Cohen? That explains the hair. It isn't a restaurant, it's a fan club. For Yizhar Cohen? Why? Do you speak French? You look surprised. Haven't you heard of us? - No. - You see? God knows where he sends us. On April 22, 1978, our king, Yizhar Cohen, won Eurovision. 157 points. 34 years ago in three weeks. Israel is our mother and Yizhar is our king. Cheers. I'll serve you myself. Eat hearty. It's all kosher. - April 22, 1978. - What? That's Shai's birthday. Why did we come here of all places and they're playing Mom's favorite song? - She's sending us signs. - Yeah, in "B" Language Love is good to me. It'll always overcome and we'll speak the language of love...... - Come dance. - No, no. - Yes, come on. - Go. - Go dance. - Come on. Come on, it's Mom's dance. Come on! I dream and awake, three words What is the world? Three words And that's how I feel now Just like then, in “B" Language“... Right! He knew Yizhar's songs by heart though he didn't understand a word. He was a cook here back in the "Beirut" days, before we bought the place. Strange 911V, but the best chef I ever met. Then why did you fire him? I had no choice. You see? We were attacked two years ago. They broke the windows and nearly burned the place down. - Who did? - North Africans. They wanted revenge because one of us broke the arms of some Arab kid who swore at him. And Maurice was involved? No, no. But people started asking questions. They want everything to be kosher. A lot of Jews come here. So Maurice isn't Jewish? I don't know. I said to him, “What do you care? "I'm not asking you to pray on Yom Kippur, "just say you're Jewish even if you aren't." But he refused. Next year in Jerusalem. Bye. Where is he now? He lives in the Le Panier district. Don't ask me where, he didn't say-. But there's a woman he took care of, maybe his mother or sister-. We sent food there sometimes. I can give you the address. - Are you sure this is the address? - I'm positive. Now what? There's no mother and no grandmother! This is Le Panier, right? You want to wander around aimlessly? - Why not? - We don't even have an address. So what do you suggest? - Why don't you check the phone book? - We did, when you were asleep. Then look again. I'm going to look around. And ask people if they're Maurice Leon? - Knock on their doors? - Yeah, okay? Why didn't Mom tell us anything? Get down from there, it's dangerous. What? Maybe there. Let Ricky talk, and you take a good look. Yes? Excuse me, are you Mr. Maurice Leon? Yes. Sorry to disturb you, we need your help. - With what? - We're looking for... Give me the photo. Do you know this woman? No, I don't know her. Sorry. - Why are you looking for her? - We aren't looking for her. She died three weeks ago. Are you sure you don't recognize her? No, I'm sorry. I can't help you. You'll excuse me. I don't think I've ever seen him. Are you sure? Did you see how he reacted to the photo? - How? - He trembled. Didn't he tremble? - What are you doing? - Knocking. - What for? I told you I can't help you. What do you want now? - Sorry, we just wanted to ask... - I don't know her. We wanted to ask if you once made a film, a movie with Isabelle Moretti. I didn't make anything. And now I'll ask you not to disturb me. If Mom were alive I'd strangle her. Are you sure his face... - I've never seen him. - He has an Arab accent. - Cut it out. - Why are you pushing? I'm fed up! Mom had an Arab accent, too. She came from Algeria, not some kibbutz in Sweden. So what? So she's an Arab and he's an Arab and so are you. - Are you cursing me? - Yes. And I'm an Arab and he's an Arab and we're all Arabs, okay? Now lay off. Get down, he's coming out. - We lost him, damn it. - Where are we? - Where to? - I don't know. Sir? Sir? I'm calling an ambulance. I'm starving. Where are your sandwiches when we need them? Maybe that's the doctor. About time. It's not the doctor. Please don't make a scene. Where's the restroom? Yes, I called him. When? Why? Because. Want something to eat? The cafeteria's closed. He's sleeping. It went well, but took a long time. We will wake him up soon, to see he's all right. Good thing he came in, it was almost too late. There's a problem with his papers. - If you don't mind... - I'll take care of it. We almost killed him, and for what? My battery's run out. I need to make a call. I need to talk to Raziya. This whole costume is for her sake. All because I love her. What's the sense in hiding all this from her? You know what she calls Him? Daddy. She calls God "Daddy" and me she calls “Honey“. Do you need help? No. What's your name? Dorona. - And your brothers? - Natanel, and the little one is Shai. - There's another one. - Ricky, my husband. Ricky. - Is he Italian? - No, it's just a nickname. I gave it to him a longtime ago. Any kids? You're still young. What are you looking for? Our father. And who is that? What did you want from me? Are you Algerian? - Not any more. - Jewish? No. Muslim? Christian? Why is it so important? Because we need to know why they separated you from our mother. I don't know what you're talking about. Dorona, what do you want from me? This is your mother and this is you. Very beautiful woman, your mother. She's obviously very brave. How did she die? An operation. Are you angry with her, Dorona? Don't be angry with her. Don't cry my love. I'm going back soon. I moved my flight up. Why did you come? What happened all of a sudden? I'm scared. I'm afraid of losing you, too. But you're doing all you can to lose me. Doborobon. I was waiting for you. - They released me. - Isn't it too soon? Yes, but I insisted. Goodbye, Donna. - What did you find? - Nothing. Did you speak to him? What did he say? Nothing. I just remembered how you once told me, “Doborobon, it's a shame that your life is like water. “Clear, tasteless and odorless. Change a little. Surprise yourself.“ But I never believed in that. People never really change, Mom. They just start lying to themselves. You can go now, Morn. I promise I won't bother you any more. I just wish you could come here for a moment and explain to us why you did all this. Well, now I'm in your house. I have a lot of spare time so I'm pondering. I'll probably understand something in the end.
