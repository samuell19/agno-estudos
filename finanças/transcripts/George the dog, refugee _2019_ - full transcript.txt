Tomasz Wiński presents: George the Dog, Refugee I will never forget the evening when Lizzie and I first learned of George's existence... It was a kind of a miracle… as if he were an answer to our prayers… I want to fuck! Shag... screw… hump hard! Who's gonna fuck me? You idiot! They’re are staring! We are fucking over here! - We are not! - Yes we are! I need a real man or I'll go crazy… Someone nice. Who will call you even after he fucked you. Who will understand us. Who'll listen to us. Nobody understands us. Listen! We don't need a man – we need a dog! I can be your dog… I will always understand you! No! Help! Stop it now! She's shagging me! A friend of mine told me about a website, a forum for people who think they are dogs... and behave like them... Like a dating site? No, you order them and they become your dog. But you have to pay them? You don't, that's the point. They are happy to obey you… - No way… - Really! What about this one? No… our dog has to be cute! Maybe he's really nice... No! What about this one? Not bad. Looks honest. You're not gonna say anything? Ok, so… we really liked your ad. We’re just looking for a dog. We are pretty picky though, so we'd like to test you first... Of course, I understand that… I will do anything to satisfy you. Really? Yeah, anything. - But we are really hard to please! - Yeah, we are. That’s good. Besides, if you aren’t fully satisfied, you can cancel the whole thing at any time. If the dog gets naughty… What do you mean, naughty? But he won't... He won't... He's a good dog. So… when can we try you out? I want it too! Few days later George wrote us that he really enjoyed spending time with us and asked if we wanted to take him for a proper walk… I was totally against it but Lizzie just couldn’t refuse. Again? Doesn’t matter. Try once more… Catch! You don’t know how to throw! That’s not true, he doesn’t know how to catch… Shake! Another one. Hold it... Hold it! Look up! Hey! Take a photo, will you? This is good, isn’t it? And roll over! Roll over! And again! Here it is! George, come back here! Are you ok? - Are you enjoying yourself? - Yes. George! Thanks a lot, George. We had a lot of fun! What’s wrong? This was the most beautiful day of my life… I don't want to go back home. My mother hates dogs. She's allergic to them... She calls me names, like faggot or pervert. You were playing a dog again? You licked asses again? You like to eat shit, don’t you? You know what, you shit lover? Go polish the toilet, you disgusting shit eater. You make me sick! Can you imagine? Talking like that to her own son? Could I sleep over? I don’t want it for free… I’ll do anything you want… I could clean, cook for you… I earn money and all, so I could give you all I earned and you could buy whatever you want… I’ll do anything… I just don’t want to go back home! I can’t stand it there any longer! Okay then! You can stay till tomorrow. Thanks. But you need to calm down right now, okay? - Is it ok for you, till tomorrow? - It’s great! Thanks a lot… I'm sorry. It was a bit too much for me. Ok, we don’t give a shit. - Thanks. - Enjoy your meal. George? George, come here! Dogs aren't allowed in the kitchen. or the bedroom… they belong in the hallway. What now? You're crazy! Why? You invited a strange man to our house! He's not a man... He's a dog. Yeah, right. And now you force him to eat on the floor! I don’t force him to do anything. You can't humiliate him. He’s mentally handicapped! I’m not humiliating him. He wanted to be our dog, didn't he? Didn’t he say he'd do anything? Yes he did! He's not mentally handicapped. Why do you say that? He just likes when people boss him around, he enjoys it! This spaghetti is delicious! Let's set some rules, shall we? Tomorrow, we sleep all day. You will clean in the morning and get out. And just try to start something during the night! No weird sounds, no wandering around the flat. You’ll stay here on the floor, on all fours… Understood? Yes. Dogs don’t talk. Come on! Come on! In the end, George stayed with us. First for another night, then for a week and then for good... Lizzie kept him in constant uncertainty. Every day, she told him we would see if he deserved to stay one more night. George paid for our rent, food, clothes and smokes, so we didn't have to do anything at all. I don’t want to study just to study something! I need time, that’s all. I don’t know! So don’t send me the money, I don’t give a fuck! Goodbye! Shit! Why wouldn't he write or call me? Because you slept with him too soon. You need to learn to train them. Push and pull! But they always give me this sad look... I feel so sorry for them... And then you wonder why he lets you go? So what should I do? You gotta make them try hard! Let them sniff the bait! Take a piece of meat, wave it in front of them, but don't let them touch it. Let them wait, let them get worked up! And before you feed him, you've gotta make him suffer and put a leash on him, so that he won’t notice it. Sometimes rub him a bit, sometimes jerk him a little... You jerk his dick, jerk it… jerk it, jerk it, jerk it... and then suddenly BOOM! You hit his balls hard! He whines and whimpers, because his balls really hurt... so you start jerking the poor thing again... to ease the pain. He relaxes for a while, you jerk it again, jerk it and jerk it and then BOOM! You hit his balls again. You get it? And then you're a cruel bitch and everyone hates you. Love isn't about taking off the leash sometimes, - it's about never putting it on. - That’s nice! Was anyone talking to you? Go polish the toilet! Come on! Off you go! On all fours! George! Slowly, we began to realize that George was smarter and more perceptive than he seemed... George, how did you find out you're a dog? I always had it inside of me... And it always wanted out, but I kept smothering it. Then one day I realized it couldn’t go on. I needed to let it out for a proper walk! I am a refugee from my mother's cunt and I long to go home. But that's impossible... There's no way back. Get out! - Get out! - I’m sorry… - Get out at once! - It will never happen again… - How dare you?! Get out! - l'm sorry... How did he get in anyway? I woke up, George was waiting by the door whining... - I didn’t mean any harm. - Go where you belong! - With a dog? - Don’t be so hard on him. You’re disgusting! I’m terribly sorry… I didn’t mean to hurt you… I just want to please you! I don’t care! Go to your spot right now! You make me sick. And that's how it started... Whenever I didn't get lucky with guys, I was sure that at home, my faithful George the dog was waiting for me... I think I've finally found home. Here he is! Where have you been? What the hell are you doing? Have you seen that? Lizzie got to shag with guys much more often than I did, because she knew how to put on the leash. So we spent a lot of time on our own with George, I was much easier on him than she was. But then, one evening everything went bad. Lizzie? Shit, I have a guy here! I texted you to get out and take George for a walk! Oh, shit, I turned off the sound... Anna, this is Charles, Charles, meet Anna! - Hey. - Hi. Nice to meet you. What'll it be, Charlie? Wanna smoke? Maybe a drink instead. Crap! We're out of booze. Anna, would you take George for a leak? He's been inside all day. You could pick up some vodka and cigarettes at the gas station. - Pretty please! - Why do I always have to walk him while you fuck? Why can’t you do it when I ask you nicely? You ask me nicely all the time… That’s not true! I walk George all the time. Why couldn't Charles go to the gas station? He could walk George! Yeah right… What the fuck is that?! That's our dog, George. George, this is Charles! So, this is some retarded cousin or flatmate or what? No, he's our dog. Yeah, right… But is he pretending he's an idiot, or is he for real? No. He's our dog George, a refugee! A refugee, really? Where are you from, refugee? He can't talk. - He can't talk! - He can't speak Czech? He can't talk in the house. Right... So you’re a little dumb, right? Look, I don't really... what the... - What the fuck are you doing? - George, come here! Down! Calm down right now! Are you fucked in the head or what? - And off to the toilet! - What the fuck? He’s not used to visitors, he must have got scared. He pissed on you, so what? He’s a dog. Go fuck yourself, I won’t stay here a minute longer! The drugs have fucked up your head! Bye! - Charles, please… - Leave me alone! He didn’t mean to do it! Charles left because of you! And you pissed all over the floor! So now you're gonna lick it clean! And you're gonna lick the toilet bowl too… Lick the bowl! Lick that bowl, I say! Lick it clean! Lick it, you ungrateful faggot! You stupid bitch! You lick asses, don’t you? You eat shit in the woods? So now lick that toilet bowl… And lick it really clean! What the hell are you doing? Behave yourself! Anna! Anna! Help me! Anna! George disappeared... He left his clothes, his bowl and his collar… He never called us again... Soon after that, his profile was erased on the man-dog website. Only after he was gone, I realized that I never felt so close to anyone... And I guess I never will... George was the only one who truly listened to us, who would never do anything to harm us on purpose, who truly understood who we were... We were only really ourselves with him, normal and relaxed... I waited for him for a long time, hoping he would come back... but George never returned. Then I remembered he once told us: "Every dog is only a human being... If you humiliate the dog in me, the dog who loves you, the man in me will hate you forever."
