MOROMETE FAMILY What's the matter with you, Ilie? Why aren't you asleep? I was dreaming of a white piglet... Paraschiv was strangling it in the yard. What might it mean? If only we had as many piglets as you dream of... You speak as you could see death looming ahead. May you drop dead Bisisica! What's the matter with you, Nicolae? May the wolves eat you! This damn sheep is torturing him. We might have sent him to school! Where are you going, Inocentie, so early in the morning? What do you intend to do with that pig? There is no pig, but a sow. I am going to Milica. Come and see after the ducks! Moromete! Costica, bring some nails! Mother, where are the paper-curlers? I gave them to Toderici. When will you start reaping? In one or two weeks. I'll start earlier. Gimme a cigarette , Slobbery! Did you think about selling me that acacia-tree? It'll rain tonight . The Romanian will have trouble deciding what to do with his wheat . Albei said he'll start collecting the land-tax. He'll take stuff from them who haven't paid it so far. You never have enough of prattling! Milk the sheep! What will you eat? Crayfish! Is this your only worry? -I'll pay you for it. -I'll be back. Niculae! Bring in the sheep for milking! May the wolves eat you! Leave the sheep alone, milksop! To hell with you! Can't you hear what father says? You'd better put the curry on the horses! Achim... Let me go with the horses. Mind your sheep... Your Bisisica... -I'll soon be noon! -Where did you get this idea? -I've got to give them cheese. -It's under the laundry cauldron. Ilinca! Bring that bag! -How come you're so hardworking? -Wait till I spank you . . . Nila! Make a patience dock soup. I've got to go to the old man. When shall I make the shuttles? What is Moromete's son staring at? Let's chase his sheep into the maize-field. Hey, you! Why do you allow the sheep in the maize-field? I wonder why Niculae hasn't come yet . Come to eat! Or maybe you want bells to call you . May rabies strike you! Put down the cheese! Give it water now! -You're gonna eat the dog! -Is the dog fit to be eaten? It's fit to eat you . I'll go away! May Death take you all! Go to the table! Why are you grinning the beans? -Where have you been? -Bathing. If I sweep the floor with you, I'll spare you work. Nila! Akim! Come to eat! Then you may sleep until the morning after tomorrow. Bring yourself a pillow, girl! Them here aren't able to make a chair. -Why don't you make one? -Ain't I doing enough? -Shut up! -Can't you hear what Fangy says? -Shut up! What do you do the whole day?... Chew, chew... Will you bring that food? Vasile, what happened with this limping horse? How should I know? Bring the lantern. There is no need. -What might have happened to that boy? -Take these away ! Now you're worrying about the little one? Much do you care about him. You should have let him go to school... -Now school, then what? -Shut up, you, fool! You talk so much your jaws will be aching. As if studying was all that's left for us to do. Catanoiu' son is going to Bucharest. So what? Let him go! We have 24 milk sheep. It means 240 lei a day. This means... This means foolishness in your head. In autumn we have to pay the bank. Let him go. It's not only the money. They are big boys and haven't a rag on their backs. What can they buy it with? -And what will you eat? -We've lived without sheep before. A hen today, a lamb tomorrow... We begin reaping. We'll bake bread. It's hard to work the field without milk. She'd got hens and lambs on her mind. Paraschiv! After food ,what follows? -What? -A cigarette! -Gimme a cigarette! -But I haven't! He's shaking all over. -Where are the sheep? -At the district. -Leave him alone , Achim! You can't do anything right! Nila! I'll spin now... -What do you want? -Come here! Why have you called me? -What do you want? -Sit down! Do you think he should go to Bucharest with the sheep? Who? Achim. I would let him go. But you see... One can't work eating only amaranth. On the other hand, we need money, too. The loan must be paid back. The tax - collector will come soon. Do you hear what I'm telling you? Well... Mother said he should go. It's not difficult for him to go. But I'm asking you... what shall we eat ? There are other people who have no sheep. They live, they work... All right, Nila! I've asked you so you shouldn't grumbIe afterwards. We'll see what he does. I don't expect 2000 a month. Two thousand a month aren't easy to get. There are 40 bushels of wheat. It's not possible. But if he comes in autumn with 6000. -But will he come? -Why shouldn't he? Well, not six... but at least 4. You mean not even 4? -Mother! -Stop it! You, crazy boy! I've got rid of Bisisica! I'm hungry! -Haven't you got milk? -I have. I've kept some for you. What about Bisisica? What do you mean? Who's told you? Father was telling Nila he'd let Achim go to Bucharest with the sheep. You'll come up on the hill... You won't have any joy any more. What did you talk about? -Tell me! -About Achim taking the sheep to Bucharest. Nila, did you tell him anything? Are you crazy or what? Come to aunt Maria to speak here. Where are they going? Let them be. Move away! You've made me lose money. It's not my fault he took the sheep away. It's good to let him go. Others do it and they get by all right. If only we didn't stand it here in vain. How his boy is singing! Is it Birica? Yes. Slobbery's daughter is giving him the jitters. Her father wants her to marry that cripple, Cotelici. Because he's rich. Why can't he find another girl? There are plenty around? Why are you whistling at my gate? Leave my daughter alone! 24 milk sheep means 240 lei a day. That's what he said. What was those lazybones saying? His mother... To let him go as they's poor and has no clothes on their backs. Why are you laughing? Then he told this one something. -What did he tell you? -I've toId you before. God knows what he told you and you didn't understand. He'll let him go, but he must bring 4000 in autumn. 4000 lei. Nila and Paraschiv, when are you leaving? When Achim arrives in Bucharest. You should run before. There'll be no one to reap their wheat. Take the horses! It's your fortune! Had your mother lived, you'd've been at your homes. Nila! Wake up, we are busy! Wake up, can't you hear me? -Why are you waking me up? -We are busy! I've told you the scarecrow has come. Can't you hear what he says? Take the other axe and come on! Why did you have to die, Ion? Can't you hear me where you are? Pray to God to take me, too! You've left me alone on the earth... You've left me all alone! I can't stand it anymore Ion! It isn't difficult to die, Ion. But I lead a tormented life here... And the kids are getting ill... Can you hear me where you are? I can't stand it anymore, Ion! Poor her! She's right! I can't stand it anymore, Ion! Nila! By the time the sun rises we've got to fell it. This acacia -tree? Why should we fell it? Just so! For fools to wonder! Give a hand! Stop staring! -Why are you bringing them here? -Didn't you tell me to? Yes... Leave them here for the tree to fall on them. Get up and tie the rope. If it moves, jump down! Catch it! Come down! Get by the horses! Why are you staying head between ears? Ilie! Why have you felled the acacia -tree? Are things that bad? -Why have you felled it? -Ask Nila... -Why? - For the fools to wonder! You laugh, you stupid! Don't leave, dear, I'll send you with the dress I made. She forced me to sew a holy Sunday. Victor! Have a plum - brandy! Father, I don't drink plum - brandy in the morning. Why? Is your stomach upset? No! But I'm not in this habit. We are... How come a man doesn't like drink? This is according to faculties. Some like to have a fuzzy mind. I like mine to be clear. It is a point of view. Tell the girl to bring some more. Or you don't want to have a fuzzy mind, either? Aren't you odd, uncle Ilie? Polina, bring some more plum - brandy! How's Tita? Gimme the money, I am busy! Leave alone the brandy... Why won't you sell the plot behind the house? Which plot? This one here? Yes. I'll give you good money . -It's my sister's. -It's yours. When did your sister leave the house? More than 15 years ago. The law says after 15 years, the inheritance is yours. It's not so. Give me that money. Forward march! Shoulder arms! Left about! Gimme the gun! Gimme the gun! I got to go! What've you got against him? He's smart! A man of 24... Take this, Paraschiv. Release the sheep from the district. Give it to them! Bildea! Can't you hear me? Bisisica is waiting for you... Bisisica is waiting for you... What if you go with the sheep for once? You got nothing to say? Gimme the sickles to have them sharpened. Tita! The other sweater! -Nila! Where are you running? -To the pre-military service. Instead of minding your business at home... You are fools, that's why you are going! You aren't right! -Why , Dumitru? -That's why! After the premilitary, they become officers. Maybe... But Nila won't be an officer, even if there is no one else round. You are wrong, Moromete! Come and take the girl! I might be wrong... Victor tells me this is according to... -Faculties. -You see? But what faculties? Victor says he doesn't drink plum - brandy. He says it depends on faculties. -What faculties? -I don't know. These faculties don't allow him to drink. Thick milk! ... Thick milk! Hey, what are you doing? Hey! Who am I speaking to? You, sons of bitches! Don't swear or I'll call father. You'll call the mother of hell! Tell me who of you's beaten my brother or I'll skin you all alive! Who knocked you off last night? I don't know, they had masks on! So you ain't gonna tell? -Tell me! -It wasn't me last night! Then who was it? You? -Tell me! -Tell him! Why should he thrash me? So you do know... Tell me who they were! If not, I will gnaw your gullet! Ciinaru's son and Burtica's son. Get them! Niculae, get them! Ciinaru's son and Burtica's son! -He's broken my head! -So it's you! -What did he do to you? -Uncle Achim... Shut up, eyesore! You see my brother? Go throw him to the ground! Don't you understand? Get him! Throw him to the ground! Throw him to the ground! Now you don't want to... Blasted coward! There were two of you last night... Fight him now! Throw him to the ground. D'you see me taking his side? That's enough! It is for your sake Marioara... That I allowed my horse to die... Hey, Voicu... Do you get anything out of your roaches? Do you know how much these is wanted? I am thinking of developing. -Bye! -So long! -Hello, Moromete! -Hello, Mitica! Hello, Moromete! Why have you all gathered here? Where's Tycoon? Tycoon, haven't you had enough sleep? Moromete wants you. -Sharpen these... -I haven't time! You sharpen them! I'll stand a round. Cocky is coming! Why are you late? Maybe he's been to church... You, smart guys! What did I tell you? Hello! Why don't you answer ? You see you are dumb? Didn't I tell you it would rain? -Gimme a cigarette! -I haven't. It's for nothing he's got two brains. That's what you think... Tycoon! -Did you get up? -I had things to do. Hello! I think Moromete is leaving us. -Why? -He no longer likes the liberals. Don't betray the party! You think you won't be a mayor without me? "The great agricultural congress" King CaroI II delivered a speech. Read to us so we should stop being dumb. Look what His Majesty says. "GentIemen, I have been informed... that your congress... is a congress of specialists. I wouId have liked it to be... a congress of wise farmers and specialists. In my opinion, our specialists... are far from beingwise farmers and householders. AgricuIture is the main occupation here. It is the main manual occupation of the Romanians... but not always his mental occupation." -Look at him! -Read! Your mental occupation, Cocky, ...is rubbish! -You are a fool. Gimme a cigarette for reading to you. Drop it! You aren't reading for me! What about those faculties, Moromete? You'd say I was wicked if I dragged your wife's name into it! Mind your own business? We'll see who's sorry in the end. It depends on faculties. 'tention! Lie down! -Lie down! -It's muddy, can't you see? Enemy in the horizon! Jump ahead! Move on! Faster! Lie down! Jump ahead! He's crazy! -He's an iron-guardist, too. -Who entrusted him with the pre-military? He joined them afterwards. -What rank did he have in the army? -A sergeant. -I should have slapped him. -You see you are a fool? If I am a mayor and I catch an iron-guardist here, I'll tie him up and thrash his soles! If he doesn't shoot you first as they did to Duca! -To hell with them! -Leave them alone! The first agriculturist, does he go ploughing? He takes the plough to the palace yard. How much land will he have? Well... about a plot and a half. More! He also supports his son, Mihai. You are silly. He's got a plot from his mother. "Great debates in Parliament... about extending the state of emergency. The speech of Mr. Virgil Madgearu... by maintaining the state of emergency for 3 years... and by requesting its extension for the 4th year... the Liberal government makes a lamentabIe exception." Hey! Who's this one? -He's well educated . -But what is he? A member of the Peasant's Party. What about the '"state of emergency"? You're dumb. Where's this state? This is like the alarm in the army. -The army come out and shoot. -Who do they shoot at? If someone rises against the state... Like the men with the strikes did. We won't work anymore, they says. Come out and we'll get others instead, the state says. You won't? Then, shoot! Didn't Niculae Tugurlan die there? The hell he did! You don't know? "The government used the weapon of diversion. They have encouraged terrorist extremism. Crimes have been committed... with the confidence of impunity." Give him water... This is no joking matter! Don't you hear what he says? Bastards! -Who is he swearing at? -At the Parliament folks. "Being sure I speak on behalf of public opinion, I request the immediate resignation of the government." The Peasant's Party will come to power. I protest against the Peasant's Party's coming to power. If they hadn't done the conversion, you'd've been in trouble. The Liberals have done the conversion! To hell with the Liberals and Peasants and all! Why are you swearing? Go into politics! Is this politics what you are doing here? The stupidity in your heads, that's what it is! Moromete, you used to be a communal counselor and you helped Aristide get rich. I spit on your politics. I listened to this fool and I came here. He likes Moromete's chit-chat. Cocky tells Ion he's dumb. Why? Because he hasn't a plot, like you? You rushed like crazy to get land... Shit! Bugger off! To hell with you! Three things are clear from what Tugurlan says: A) he who has a plot goes into politics B) because of us, Ion hasn't a plot C) we are not smarter than Ion Get the hell out of here, go to the pub and fight! Gimme a cigarette! They gave me bad nails.. Why is Tugurlan spoiling our meeting? He has no plot and he wants nobody to have one. Let's go! Goodbye! Let's go home, Cat! Let me see! What's this? -It looks like Moromete! -Yes , it does! Give it to me to put it on the shelf. I haven't! It's over with "I haven't"! I haven't! Gimme a cigarette! The land tax. Plot of Ilie Moromete, 3000 lei. Plot of Catrina Moromete, rest of payment 2800. Pay the arrears now, and the rest after reaping. Bring me a light. 3000 was received from Mr. Ilie Moromete. Come on, uncle Ilie, I am in a hurry. But I haven't! I've cut off your receipt. Come on, don't torture me! -He's cut it off. -I can see but I haven't. Come over here! -Take the trunk! -Leave the trunk alone! I won't give you nothing! Go out! Take the cart to the townhouse. You think you can pull it? Take the horses, too. The horses are mine! Push away! You'd better leave the horses alone. Can't you understand I haven't? Here's 1000 lei and we'll talk later. After 1 or 2 weeks. My son goes to Bucharest and I'll pay you. For 6 years, I've kept arguing with you. You are paying to the state, not to me. Pay up and get out of trouble. If I could print money, I would... I haven't met a man like you before. 17 years have passed since the war, since the state gave you the plots. -Which 17 years? -17 years since you have postponed paying the deeds and land-tax. You wait for the conversion to come and spare you. You have 14 acres and don't pay for the plots which the state gave you as a bargain. Which 14? Which bargain? You torture me with 500, with 601 lei. Be thankful for that one leu too. We'll see what happens this year! The comedy is over! Enough! We've danced your tune for 15 years. If you don't pay, I'll bring the gendarmes, and I'll take not only the horses, but you, too. Voicu, pay the land-tax, stop postponing it. -Hello! -Hello, Udubeasca! Angelina! Open the gate! My food is boiling over and you are too lazy to open the gate. I've taken him in! How much did you pay me for the acacia-tree? 1,200. I gave him 1,000. I cheated him of 200. A hundred I gave to the district and... this one . Did you think of what I told you this morning? I'll give you good money. The plot? Why on earth are you holding on to it? It's full of weeds. I'd make a barn on it . Hello! -Hello! -Whose son is he? Bildi's. -Is he married? -No. Why does this surprise you? Haven't you seen? He is so ugly! I ask him something and he plays deaf. -You'll come to me yourseIf. -It's my sister's plot. Didn't I tell you? Or are you scatter-brained? You're not only one-eyed , you can't hear either. You no longer come to the sacred church. It's in hell your soul will rot! You should have heard the sermon. "Not he who cares about this life... will go to the Kingdom of Heaven. Raise your eyes towards Heaven." And gives us, God, sermons and funeral cakes and bring many fools to church... How happy Satan is when hearing you! Go away! Your soul is black with sins and tobacco! Paraschiv! Slobbery sells the maize for 70 and you for 60. When I wanted to get money, you laughed at me. Now, find your own way out! Dumb one, come over here! Play it all! Tita! Tell Polina to come to the glade. I won't go! Victor will think... I am going after him. Ilinca! Tell Polina to come to the glade! Hello, Birica! Why have you called me? What do you want? You had your father come out and swear at me. You are getting married? Damn you! -You should have said you didn't like me. -I did. On Thursday after Easter. And I won't account to you. I'll marry whom ever I like. I didn't come out as I was scared of father. I thought he knew about you. "Eleven brothers were under a spell... of wandering about till sunset, when they fell in the middle of the sea as men." Moromete! Are you at home? Good evening, Catrina! The others doesn't deserve being greeted. They's fools. Gimme a cigarette! Have you heard? Polina's run away with Birica! Good for them! Don't speak like that! You've got daughters too. Has Albei gone crazy? He's written down my stuff. To hell with him! I am not so sure of that. You think the State doesn't know... the peasant can't pay the land-tax? Niculae, go on! "To get rid of the spell... their sister had to weave, in a certain time, without uttering a word... eleven coats of stinging nettles. She didn't have time... to finish the sleeve of one coat. And her little brother left with a swan wing..." Achim, will you leave after the rain stops? Yes, I will. Come on, get it in! You'll return in autumn, won't you? Maybe. Let's go! -We've got to reach Bucharest... -Bucharest won't get moved over. To hell with it, uncle Ilie! Paraschiv! Is there anything in the manger for the horses? I've put in some maize stalks. Achim, be careful what you do there! My sister blabbers that I don't allow you... to get on in life. Come on, Achim! What are you waiting for now? Take care! In one week time we start reaping. Buy some sickles and give them to Scamosu to bring them here. Where shall I find him? Ask around. The boy is leaving and you... Buy me a scarf. Send a dozen scarves... A dozen... you... brood hen... All right... You go to school from tomorrow on. Deed. "Mr. Ilie no longer has the right... to pay the land-tax." To hell with it, uncle Ilie! -You're laughing, but... -Have you got much to pay? Last year, I wouldn't let him take your cart. If you keep postponing it... Did he take anything from your house? No! But he will! What will he take? Drop it... If you are elected in the Communal Council, We'll manage. What do you think, Moromete? -Take it! -No! I allowed him to go to Bucharest. And he is to send me some money. What if the tax collector comes? I don't understand. Can't you hear Achim's gone to Bucharest? So what? He is to send me some money. I haven't got money for the land-tax now. So. Lend me 4000 till my son sends the money. Why don't you say so? I gladly lend money to my friends. Come to the pub, I haven't got it with me. Hello, Tugurlan! Hello! You'll get nothing in the end! The folks in the village say your father... will leave the old woman... the house and half of the plot. Because you're dumb, that's why? It's the fortune left by your mother... and the folks will be on your side. Father doesn't understand people are laughing... because we allow them to eat our food. People are saying we are fools. The girls will be pulling at the bottom of your trousers. I could have got married but I wouldn't. Because of you. To make you stand on your own feet. You? You'd better take a look at yourself. -You take me for an idiot like you? -Stop quarrelling! When are you leaving? Paraschiv! Paraschiv, wait! Why have you stopped? Where are we going? How will father reap without horses? Bloody idiot! Ilinca, gimme some flowers! Shut up, you! Not long ago, you were watching the sheep... and now you want a garland. The school master told me to bring a garland. You'd better stop working and come to church! It's in hell your soul will rot! What's hell? Has anyone returned from there? That's right! It can't be worse than here. And what's the soul? -A steam floating about. -Yes, floating. What must be in your souls... -The evil one's reigning there! -He's reigning! Mother! Tell her to give me some flowers! -I need them for the garland. -Take some from the garden. It isn't you who digs this garden... Since when are you so stingy? Where might those boys be? They've taken the horses grazing. Why haven't they come back? Go and ask them! I had arranged with the elder one to repair my attic. What have you done with those horses? Can't you hear me? The guards chased them into the oats field. To hell with you! You are good-for-nothings! To hell with your muzzles and all! You're a couple of fools. -Daddy! -What d'ye want? Gimme your hat to go to the school festivity. Go away! Give it to him, he's been moaning since morning. Here! You've got a head like a barrel. What're you doing at school? -Moromete, are you at home? -Where else? Wipe off those horses! -Hello! -Have a cigarette! Come on, I'll stand a plum-brandy! What's come over you? Is it the first time I stand a treat? -What did Anistide say? -To hell with him! That elections are near... No one'll get to see the elections! You mean there'll be no elections? How can someone rule without being elected? You know what I did last night? I rolled cigarettes and I thought. All the night I was smoking and thinking. Till I felt I was bursting and I fell asleep. What did you think of? I won't tell you because you won't keep mum. What did you think of? Two men had come to the pub by a gig. They was smart but spoke rubbish. They says the iron-guardists will come to power! That the parties've brought the country to ruin... and it must be stopped from rolling over. And Victor, Slobbery's son, will stop it. -You're talking nonsense. -You're dumb. The iron-guardists are no joking matter. How many votes did they get in winter? "Three she-cats quarrelling one day. Went to the tomcat who was idling away." -What's going on there? -A school festivity. Let's go and see. "To make equal the parts Bitting off he starts... He ate till his tummy was full The she-cats were left with the crumbs... But they had to abide by his rule." What a smart tomcat! First prize for boys: Moromete Niculae! -Who's son is he? -Moromete's! Take off your hat! Poor boy! He can't wear a hat! Tell the poem! "The hardworking reapers Sacks under their arms..." That's enough, Niculae. "Getting... along... the furrow..." That's enough, Niculae. Why won't he let him tell the poem? What's the matter with you? Tell me! I got the fever again. Can you walk? Come over to the sunny side! Daddy, I'm getting numb, I'm very cold. I'll get down! Come on! To hell with it all! You are all getting ill when you shouldn't. You will never listen to me. Niculae, wake up! Come! -Wake up! -Let him sleep a little longer! Get that food ready! What d'you think I'm doing? Get up, we're going reaping. Nila! Fill that up! Where are the sickles? You expect them to clink like bells? -Let's oil the wheels. -I oiled them yesterday. We got to reap for aunt Maria, too. Don't forget the onion. Where is the anvil? Here it is! -Mother! -We've left the salt behind. Come on, faster! Niculae! If Bisisica'd been here, you'd've slept more. Nila, measure those shares! -Why don't you do it? -I am busy! -Measure the shares and shut up! -Niculae! Start over! What the hell! Noon is near! Go to hell with your muzzle, you. Do you have a needle? My skirt is torn. Let me see how it cuts! I won't reap with this! Come on, start! Nila, Manda is asking about you... Niculae, start reaping! Why don't you like Manda anymore? She already has a hope chest. Victor, lower it down! Hey, Nila! Ask the storks to pick up the ears... -Why are you staring? -You pick'em up! Come on, father, tie the sheaves! Why are you shouting? You've scared me! How hot it is! I'm gonna move away! Hey, Voicu! This sun's gonna melt us. -Who? -The sun! Can't you feel it's burning? To hell with you and your cigarettes, Ilie. Ilie! The bundles're getting dry, and all you care about is chatting. Firica, the horse's got nothing to eat. Get some grass from the maize field. The Romanian'll have lots of bread... Isn't that Birica with Polina? -Have they made it up with Slobbery? -How should I know? -Hello! -Hello, Birica! They'll get into a fight now. Hello, uncle Tudor! We've come to reap. Let's reach an understanding. You think I'll speak to you? Firica, call Victor here! Don't go! Go! Who are you listening to? Uncle Tudor, let's get to an understanding. Why are you staring? Victor, come quick, father is asking for you! Let's measure your share! Birica's? What's he got to do with our plot? -Hey, Birica's son! -Let him bark! What are you doing here? I'll bury you! You, hitting Victor? Hasn't she worked for you? Isn't she your daughter? Stop it, folks! -So you're hitting me! -Leave him aIone Go away! So folks won't say I've chased the girl away. We shall see. Why didn't you let me? Victor, Birica has blunted your faculties. -Down! -Leave him alone, he's worked hard, and he got the first prize at school. You hold the sickle as if it was a stork. Come to dinner! Can't you hear? Why haven't you heated it? I thought it was cold. You neither work nor keep your mouth shut. How should I know it was hot? Mother... -Sleep! -Have you told father? Yes, I have. You see I've got a prize without going to school too often. After 8 years I'll be a school-master. Why not a priest? Are you resting or what? What do you want, Niculae? You wanna go to school? Now? Today? Have you forgotten me here? Careful, you've had us covered with dust. Anton! Move this aside! Tell mother we're thrashing. She's got to kill a hen. Run! You hear me? And give you money to buy some plum-brandy. Hey, Tugurlan. -Have a cigarette? -You'll get about 600... -What? Bushels? -Yes. No! But there will be about 500... The Romanian'll eat plenty of bread... -How many acres have you got from the estate? -Two. And you give half to Mrs. Marica. I also get the straws. Why do you work her land? -What can I do? -Go elsewhere. How's that to give her half your work? Can't you hear I get the straws, too? -You mean it's more that half... -Yes. That's different then. To hell with Mrs. Marica! Tell me, will the Government come out of power? Tugurlan! Come with me! Stan! What're you gonna do, Stan ? To see if there's less flour. Ifit isn't less, I won't do anything. Udubeasca, 2 sacks. Ciinaru, 3 sacks. Why did you beat Ion? Your brother did. You've come again? To call me a thief? Why did he call you a thief? Because you steal the folks' flour. What did you say? Son of a bitch! Go away or he'll kill you! Run away, Tugurlan! He went to bring help. Let's weigh the sacks! I'll sue them! Why should I run away? -Why are you hitting me? -I'll tell you at the police station. And you come to the station, too... Why d'you hit when you don't know what's happened? I don't know what's it all about? -You started the fight with Mr. Tache. -He started the fight with me. Why didn't you come to tell me? I asked why there was less flour. And he started hitting me. Take them to the police station. Flour missing, you say? The mayor is a thief? For everybody he is the mayor, and for you he is a thief. Yes! For me, he is a thief! Florica, you've found your match... Lay your hands on him! Lay your hands on him! Why are you setting the gendarmes on me? Because you are not honest! You are afraid people'll find out you are a thief... Come to get your gun. Gimme the gun! Gimme the gun! Tugurlan! Now I'll see how you get on without a gun... Tugurlan! Gimme the gun or you'll be in trouble! -Hello , Moromete! -What's the matter with you? Have a cigarette! Now, it's against me you're bearing a grudge. If I'd had my way, I'd have just thrashed him. Aristide has telephoned the prefect. Come on, they have to get to Rosiori. It'll pass, believe me! Good luck to you, Tugurlan! Father! Father! What is it? I am going to school. So go! You'll see I go. Niculae, come to eat. Stop laughing at him. You want some more? Is that why you've gone there? Where, father? Where? To Bucharest. I meet Scamosu and he says: "Achim is a big wig in Bucharest." "Well, maybe he is." "I was at the Obor market in a pub... to have a drink... and I saw Achim." "With him was abroad who used to be a servant: He was so dressed up I could hardly recognize him." "He had a tie... and shoes." That's it! What if he had a tie and shoes? Maybe he found them second-hand... I didn't say anything, did I? Ilie! Ilie! Can't you hear me? I'm afraid something will happen to Niculae. What could happen? Don't you understand he loves school? Let him go! Ilie! I can't stand it anymore! I can't sleep any longer. These dreams are torturing me! I dreamt Niculae was taken to hospital, and when I went there... there was a littIe light at the morgue. "Oh, God, the boy is dead!" and I woke up. Two months have passed, he should send the money from Bucharest. Tell me straight: yes or no. Or eIse I'll sell an acre and get money for school. What's the matter with you, boy? -My book... -What about it ? She's taken it so I won't go to school. I don't give a damn about your books. Niculae! You hear me? I'll tell you where it is... You have no pity for him! He'll get ill again. Let him! Or you've already seen him a gentleman? With words, it's easy to send him to school... Open the gates. You've got so much hate in you! If your father were to die, you'd throw us out. And I brought you up as if you were my own. Come on, get up! Move away! Can't you hear me? Them here's hidden the book. What did you do with the boy's book? Ask Ilinca... I've seen a book in the dung heap. Go look for it! Wipe it with your tongue, ass-hole! Moromete! Here! -What do you want? -Pay the land tax! Haven't I paid it? Will you pay or won't you? You've got five hundred bushels of wheat! The price is to Iow now. If you don't pay up in two hours' time... I'll come to take your cow. Come on! Come to Dumitru. Why do you keep pestering me? Why don't you pay your taxes? -Allow me 2 months more. -I can't. I am not the state to exempt you from taxes. It's to the state you've got to pay, not to me. I haven't! What will you do to me? I'll take the cow from your yard! The state doesn't ask you to force me. Wait. The state has money, not like me. I have waited enough! It's over! This year, finances are stricter than ever. Here's the order! You've got to pay! Sell and pay up. No more postponing it! You pretend not to see me? I have to speak to you. The tax-collector won't postpone my land-tax. We had meetings twice. I thought you and Cocky would come. Or maybe you listen to Tugurlan and oppose me? Or did the elections come and you didn't get our votes? You should have come to the meeting. The others would have come, too. This way, the others are gaining ground. And there'll soon be trouble. How are you? I hear you've sold some wheat. You know why I am asking you. You won't ask me for the money, will you? Yes, I wiII. I need it. I can't sell the wheat at the present prices. This is none of my business. I've sold a little, to send the boy to school. Dumitru, where are you going? -To the tax-collector. -Don't. It's in vain. Let's go home and mind our business. You think an entire people will stand them to take our food for nothing? They have either to offer more for the wheat or to reduce the land-tax. -What about the land-tax? -There is time. -What if they take my cow? -They won't take it. They won't do that, because it's dangerous, believe me! Come on! I could give you the money. But this is my capital and I need it back quickly. -When? -In a week's time, at the most. I'll buy hens and take them to Bucharest. You shall have it back in a week. I have those sheep. Achim will bring them. I'll sell them on Saturday and give you the money on Sunday. I can't. I need the money. Can't you hear that on Sun... You think Achim... won't bring them back? You think I am lying to you? I'll tell you but don't swear at me... if it isn't true. Catanoiu told me... What? Your sons agreed to run away from home. Achim won't return with the sheep. What? What are you saying? Maybe Catanoiu is lying. There are 3 months since he left. He hasn't sent me any money. Not a penny... Achim, Achim... Nila, Nila... Paraschiv, Paraschiv... I can't believe it that your sons... My sons... My sons are sick. Run away from home? Why? I let them have complete freedom. If they had said: "We are running away!" Why run away? I wouId have said. Can't you just walk? Move away! Ilinca, come in here both of you. What's happened, Ilie? Maybe he didn't manage to get the loan. We've passed through harder times before . We'll sell and we'll pay. Get up! Get out of the house! Leave him alone! Tita! Ilinca! Take those from the next room, too! Come faster! Go through the back door! Moromete! Pay the land-tax! Moromete! Pay up! We'll sell and we'll pay. Wait a while. No more waiting! Pay up! 3000 plus 2000... 5614 lei in all! But we haven't! I'll take your stuff! Open that trunk! Take wool sack and the cauldron! No! Not the cauldron! Anything else but not the cauldron! It's the money for the boy's school. Niculae, I won't let you down. I'll sell a plot and you shall go to school. Who's knocking like that? -Open up! It's Paraschiv. -I am not his servant. Who's there? Open the door or I'll break it down! You will ,will you? Let's see... Shut up, father! Why are you knocking like that? Why didn't you put on the light? - Let him light it himself. -Wait till I knock some sense into you. Gimme clean pants and a shirt. Couldn't you take your shoes off outside? The icon! Have you gone crazy? Has the foolish woman you've been with... Has the foolish woman you've been with smeared your mouth with cow-dung? You are a young man now. Dirtier than the socks he's wearing. Tita, you'll get it in the neck! I will have my way in the end... That's how like it! Where have you been? Move away! Tell me where have you been! Paraschiv! Nila! Get up! Why? Can't you see it's raining? -Come on, Nila! -Stay here, ass! What did you say? You are waking us up at dawn, after we've been working for you for a lifetime? Well, Paraschiv... I think you should get up, we're busy. But if you are tired, sleep. He might be tired, poor boy! He's been toiling all night! Break, bang, what else are you able to do? I break! I bang! Is them yours? Ilinca, call your father! You think I am scared of him? What about you, Nila? Happy to be master for once? We'll go away and you'll stay with your father, and go to the dogs together! And where will you go? To some cave? God won't desert us! It'll be woe for you! You've been plaguing me to death, swine! Let him be! He is so stupid! -Bring me the sacks from the trunk! -What else do you want? Leave that trunk alone! -Calm down! -Leave the trunk alone! Ilie! Come, these two are killing each other! Don't touch that stuff. Come here, may Death strike you! Leave her alone or you'll kill her. Ilie! Come here! May... Ilie, come quick inside. What is it? What's the matter with you ? Look, Ilie, where we've got. I told you to put half of the plot on our names, and make ourselves a hut and let them stay here. I was like a mother for them and they want to kill us. -What's come over you? -Why d'you keep asking? What's the matter with you, Catrina? Come on, tell me! Tell me! Can't you hear me? Have you gone dumb? Mother! They are woman's stuff. Get them under your trousers or you'll be laughed at. Paraschiv and Nila, come to the barn. I'm afraid the roof will collapse. Let it collapse! Come on, Nila, the rafters will get broken. -Stay here! -To hell with the rafters! What if the barn collapses? Where will you get another? Can't you hear we ain't coming. As you like... Don't tell me I haven't asked you . Hey, Nila! Come on, are you ready? We are not going! If only they'd told us at the beginning, we'd have taken our stuff and left. Now, we've become their laughing-stock. Shut up! You are crying out of pride. Come on, Nila, my son! It's cleared up! Why d'ye keep coming in and going out? Can't you hear we ain't coming? Well, Paraschiv, I thought... Save your breath! Nila, you are more obedient... His obedience has suited you. So you put him to the yoke. Fool, get your hand into that trunk! You got no pants... and the trunk is filled with dainty stuff. Don't hit me, father! -Stop hitting me! -Stop hitting him! Calm down! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Will you do it again? Will you do it again? I won't! You, wretch! Paraschiv, you, wretch! And you, too, Nila! You either do what I say, or if not, go away! I struggle to keep the land whole. You stupid blind fool! And you rush upon me and the others, saying we've stolen your work. The land which is whole, you, not, there's where your work is. Didn't we work together and didn't we share all we had? We all walked bare-footed, you greedy. Where could I get more to give you? What do you want me to do? Go to the highway and rob? Hello, Moromete! -How are you? -All right! How are your children? All right. I hear you're sending Niculae to school. I'm thinking of doing the same with mine. Will it be expensive? Trafurica, come here! They say with a grant, it isn't too expensive. What do you think? I don't know. -Isn't that Moromete? -It's him. Moromete, you're passing by us without giving us a glance? Let's have a chat! You got nothing else to do but chatter? Get him! Get him! Take him! Take him! Faster, someone's coming! Faster! Ilie... Dumitru... Dumitru! How is that possible? To hell with his faculties and all! I should have broken his legs then. How could Victor beat Dumitru? I've told you there is nojoking matter with these iron-guardists. Dumitru... May their soulswither up! Who are you leaving us to, Dumitru? Get the little one ready! We're leaving! What're you gonna leave by? What d'ye mean? By cart! -Ilie... -What is it? What's happened? Paraschiv and Nila... -What about them? -They've run away. They've taken the horses with them. All right! Get the little one ready! Slobbery! You said you wanted to buy land. I'll buy your land if you also sell me this plot behind the house. Bring me the money, I'm in a hurry! I want to buy a couple of horses to go to town with. Give it to me! Take this too, Niculae, sonny. Come on, sit down! -Move aside! -Be careful, Niculae! Niculae! Niculae! Where are we going, man? Come on!
