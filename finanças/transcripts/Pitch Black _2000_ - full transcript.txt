They say most of your brain shuts down in cryo-sleep. All but the primitive side the animal side. No wonder I'm still awake. Transporting me with civilians... Sounded like forty, forty-plus. Heard an Arab voice. Some hoodoo holy man... Probably on his way to New Mecca... But what route? What route? Smelled a woman... sweat, boots, tool belt, leather, prospector type Free settlers. And they only take the back roads And here's my real problem. Mr. Johns... Blue eyed devil... plannin' on takin' me back to slam. Only this time he picked a ghost lane A long time between stops... A long time for something to go wrong. Why did I fall on you? He's dead. The Captain's dead. I was looking night at him. The chrono shows we are 22 weeks out so gravity was not supposed to kick in for another 19. Why'd I fall at all? Did you hear what I said? Captain's dead. 1550 millibars. Dropping 20 MB per minute. Shit! We're hemorrhaging air. Something took a swipe at us. Come on. Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars. Come on! Those big bright. What? This is an emergency dispatch from merchant vessel Hunter Gratzner en route to the Tangier system with 40 commercial passengers on board. We have been knocked out of our shipping lane, and are currently entering the atmosphere of a planetary body in the following position X38-stroke-five. Y95-stroke-eight... Z21 Fry, where the hell's our Comms? Rate of descent, beyond known limits. Hey, they trained you for this, Fry, right? Center of gravity too far aft Recommend purging ballast now. What the...? Was that a purge, Fry? Too heavy in the ass. Can't get my fucking nose down. Crisis program selected Number Two in this system because it shows at least some oxygen. Maximum terrain 220 meters over mean surface largely cinder and gypsum with some evaporate deposits. Fry, what the hell are you doing? I gotta drop more load. Look, I tried everything else. I still got no horizon. Well, you better try everything twice 'cause no way do we just flush out. If you know something I don't, get your ass up here and take the chair, Owens. Listen, Company says we are responsible for every single one of those people, Fry. We both die out of sheer fucking nobility? Don't you touch that handle, Fry. I'm not gonna die for them. Airlock doors not secured. Owens! Seventy seconds. Fry! You still have seventy seconds to level this beast out. Deploy lower airbrakes now Airlock doors not secured Fuck! What the fuck is happening up there? Imam? Yeah, Imam. Zeke? Somebody's gonna get hurt one of these days. It ain't gonna be me. Here, Shazza. So, I guess something went wrong? Owens. I'm sorry. Get it outta me. Don't touch it! Don't you touch that handle! Leave it alone. Get it out of him. No... It's too close to his heart. There's some Anestaphine in the med-lock in the back of the cabin. Not anymore there's not. Get out of here. Everyone. Get out of here. That'll teach me for flying coach. Interesting. Is anyone else having difficulties breathing? Yeah. I feel one lung short. All of us. Feel like I just ran or something. There was talk of a scouting party looking for other people but then we saw this. What the bloody hell happened? Could have been a meteor storm. Might have been a rogue comet I don't know. Well, I for one am thoroughly grateful. This beast wasn't made to land like this, but... I think you did well. Actually, the only reason we're alive is because of her. Yes, I suppose you're right. Yeah. Thanks for saving our dicks. No, really thanks, awfully. Well done. He just escaped from a maximum prison. So do we just keep him locked up forever? That'd be my choice. Is he really that dangerous? Only around humans. The whole bloody container's upside down. It's all topsy-turvy. Thank goodness it's not a total loss. Booze? This is what you have to drink? I'm gonna need a receipt for that. For all of this. This is my personal stuff. I don't suppose this'll help you at all? Unfortunately, it is not permitted Especially while on hajj. You do realize there's no water, don't you? All deserts have water. It only waits to be found. I hope you're right. All the more for me, then. Motherfucker. And what the h ell are these? Martha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare. And this? That's a hunting blow-dart pipe from Papua New Guinea. And that's very, very rare, since the tribe is now extinct. 'Cause they couldn't hunt shit with these things would be my guess. Well, look, what's the point anyway? If the man is gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us? Maybe to take what you got. Maybe to work your nerves. Or maybe to just come back and skull-fuck you in your sleep. He sounds like a charmer. For you. Let's just see. There we go. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Imam. If we're looking for water, we should leave soon. Before nightfall while it's cooler. Ali. Excuse me. I think you should see this. Three suns? Bloody hell. So much for you nightfall. So much for my cocktail hour. We take this as a good sign a path, direction from Allah. Blue sun, blue water. Every wondered why I'm an atheist? It's a bit of a bad sign. That's Riddick's direction. I thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset. Right. Which means he went toward sunrise. Zeke. Fully loaded clip... safety's on... One shot if you spot him, okay? Don't tell me you're going off too Yeah. But what happens if Mr. Riddick spots us first? That would be no shots. Quiet. Seven stones to keep the devil at bay. You're on a trip to New Mecca, right? Once in every lifetime, should there be a great hajj. A great pilgrimage. To get to know Allah better? Yes, but to know yourself, as well. Yeah. We are all on the same hajj now. Sorry. So did you see anything? No Riddick. Trees. And trees mean water. You comfy up there? Yes, it's amazing how you can do without the necessities of life provided you have the little luxuries. Well, just keep your bloody eyes open. I don't want that dog sneaking up on my bloody ass. You dig the graves. I'll hold the fort, old boy. Christ! He'd probably get you right here, right under the jaw and you'd never even hear him coming. 'Cause that's how good Riddick is. Tell me something, did you run away from your parents or did they run away from you? Some communal graveyard perhaps. Like the elephants of Earth. He asks what could have killed so many great things. Is this whole planet dead? Drink? Probably shouldn't do this Dehydrates you even more. You're probably right. You know, you could've stayed back at the ship. Probably should've. If we don't find water, you know what happens. I wanted to get away. I've never seen a captain so ready to leave her ship. I think we should keep moving. What did Owens mean about not touching the handle? It's just between you and me, Carolyn. I promise. I'm not your captain. During the landing, when things were at their worst, Owens was at his best. He's the one that stopped the docking pilot from dumping the main cabin. The passengers. And the docking pilot being? I guess I'm a little more glad to be here than I thought. Hassan' Suleman. Captain. Is there anyone here? There was water here. Lights. Lights on. Okay. Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar. They are saying "God is great". Allahu Akbar, yes. This is the source of the water. No darkness. No lights because no darkness. Hello, Mecca. Tell me that was you just now. What are you going on about? He's been right here helping me. Back of the ship. That noise. You trying to tell me that was someone else? No! Oh my God. I thought I was the only one who got out of the crash alive. Oh, Christ. Bloody Christ. It's just somebody else. It was just somebody else from the crash. Crikey. I thought it was him. I thought it was Riddick. No juice. It looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt it to... Shut up. Sorry, I thought I heard something. Like what? Gunshots. Zeke! Piece of shit. What did you do to Zeke? What did you do to him? Shazza. Just kill him! Just somebody goddam kill him before he... So where's the body? Well, do you want to tell me about this sounds? You told Johns you heard something. That's fine. You don't want to talk to me, that's your choice. But just so you know. There's a debate right now as to whether we should just leave you here to die. You mean the whispers? What whispers? The ones telling me to go for the sweet spot just to the left of the spine fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. It's a metallic taste, human blood. Copperish, but if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away quickly. You wanna shock me with the truth now? All you people are so scared of me. Most days I'd take that as a compliment. But ain't me you gotta worry about now. Show me your eyes, Riddick. You'd have to come a lot closer for that. Closer... Where the hell can I get eyes like that? You gotta kill a few people. Okay. I can do it. Then you gotta get sent to a slam where they tell you you'll never see daylight again. You dig up a doctor and you pay him 20 menthol Kools to do a surgical shine job on your eyeballs. So you can see who's sneaking up on you in the dark? Exactly. Leave! Leave! Cute kid. Did I kill a few people? Sure. Did I kill Zeke? No, you got the wrong killer. He's not in the hole. We looked. Look deeper. Let me tell you what I think happened. I think he went off on the guy, buried him in the hills. Now he's got you believing there's something there. Well, let's just be sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the asshole hall of fame. He loves to jaw-jack and loves to make you feel afraid, because that's all he has. You're playing right into it. Why try to explain this to you? You're a cop. For God's sake, we've got to find his body. Hey! I'll go. Look, no one is going. Stay here. Look, being ballsy with your life, doesn't change what came before. It's stupid. What, do you think I'm trying to prove something? Well, are you? I'm in here. I'm in here! I'm inside! I thought I heard something. Please. Can you hear me? I'm in here. I'm inside. Give me your goddam hand! I heard you, Fry. I heard you first. Come on. Fry... You okay? What's down there? What is it? Did you find Zeke? You're all right. Fry, you okay? Okay. Fuck. That was so fucking stupid. I don't know what the fuck is in there but whatever it is, it got Zeke and it nearly go me... Get it off me. Get it off me. Watch it. Get it off me. Watch your head. Finally found something worse than me, huh? 1 so here's the deal. You work without chains, without the bit, and without shivs You do what I say, when I say it. For what? The honor of going back to some asshole of a cell. Fuck you. The truth is, I'm tired of chasing you. Are you saying you'd cut me loose? I'm thinking you could have died in the crash. My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass Okay. Ghost me, motherfucker. That's what I would do to you. I want you to remember this moment. The way it coulda gone and didn't. Here. Take it easy. Fuck you. Do we have a deal? I want you to remember this moment. Just one? For now. Johns... So you click your fingers, and he's one of us now. I didn't say that. At least this way I don't have to worry about you all falling asleep and not waking up. So could I talk to him now? No. Blast! Paris P. Ogilvie. Antiquities dealer entrepreneur. Richard B Riddick. Escaped convict murderer That's a particularly good Shiraz. It's a lovely drop. It's... It's very expensive. By all means, please help yourself. I mean, normally I can appreciate antiques. But this, this is something else. It'll work. It's nothing we can't repair, so long as the electrical adapts. Well, it's not a star-jumper. It doesn't need to be. Take a 2-seater like this back up to the Sol-Track shipping lanes. Stick out her thumb, bound to get picked up. Ain't that right, captain? Can I have a little help here? I got it. Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Do me a favor. Check these containers out and, uh, see what we can patch these wings up with. All right? Mine! Insha Allah! We really are getting there. We've got enough power for sys-check, but we still need more cells. How many are we talking about? We got a 90 gig draw, the other ship takes 20 gig cells. That'd be five. Five total to launch. Thirty-five kilos each, huh? Fuck... Well, that's pretty heavy. You know that old sand cat out there? I might be able to get it going. Do it if you can. But if you need a hand. Where'd Riddick go? Let's go. You're missing the party. C'mon, boy. Missing the party. Come on. Oh, man. All praises be Allah, for his many blessings to us. What? It's the winner of the look-alike contest. Who were these people anyway? Miners? It looks like Geologists. You know, an advance team, moves around from rock to rock. Nice of them to leave so much stuff here. Why'd they leave their ship? It's not a ship, it's a skiff, and it's disposable really. It's more like an emergency life-raft, right? Yeah, they probably had a big drop ship take 'em off planet. These people didn't leave. Come on. Whatever got Zeke, got them. They're all dead. You don't really think they left with their clothes on hooks, photos on the shelves... Maybe they had weight limits. You don't know. I know you don't prep your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency. He's fucking right. Watch your mouth. Hey, he's just saying what we're all thinking. So what happened? Where are they? Has anyone seen the little one? Ali? Has anyone checked the coring room? Ali. Ali? Slowly. Take your time. Jack, wait. Wait. Ali? Ali? Ali? Imam? Imam? Other building weren't secure. So they ran here. Heaviest doors. Thought they'd be safe inside. But they forgot to lock the cellar. Here. What, it's broken? No. There's still a few hits. Actually, you asshole. I'm trying to say that I'm sorry. Ok, let's board this place up and get the hell out of here. Whatever the fuck those things were, they seem to stick to darkness so if we stick to daylight we should be all right, okay? Let's go. Twenty two years ago. What? These coring samples are dated. Last one's twenty two years ago this month. Okay. Is there something special about that, Carolyn? I don't know. There could be. An eclipse. You're not afraid of the dark, are you? So we've gotta get the power cells. Shit, I've still gotta check on the hull and patch the wings. Wait on the power cells. Wait for what? 'Til it's so dark we can't even find our way back? You don't know when it's gonna happen, so let's not get overexcited. Just get the fucking cells here, Johns. What is the discussion? Maybe I should tell you how Riddick escaped. He can pilot. He hijacked a prison transport and made a hell of a good run before tracked his ass down. Okay, maybe that's a good thing. Maybe we can use him to help us navigate or something. He also figured out how to kill the pilot. You told me that we could trust him. You said that we had a deal, Johns. Now you may have noticed, but chains don't work on this guy. The only way you people are truly safe is if he believes he's going free. Let's just say he stops believing... You mean if he realizes that we're gonna royally fuck him over. I want you to just listen to me for a second. If we bring the cells up at the last possible minute, when the wings are ready and when we know we're ready to launch He hasn't hammed any of us. As far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Let's just stick to the deak, Johns. He's a killer! And the law says he has to do his bid. There is nothing I can do about that. You hear me? You're dancing on razor blades here. I'm not gonna give him a chance to grab another ship or slash another pilot's throat. Not on my watch. Bad sign. Shaking like that in this heat. I thought I said no shivs. This? This is just a personal grooming appliance. Thanking you. Looks like we're a few shy. Power cells. They're coming. It's strange not doing a run-up on the main drive yet. Unless... he told you... the particulars of my escape. I got the quick and ugly version. Now you're wormed about a repeat of history? It has entered our minds. I asked what you thought. You scare me Riddick. That's what you want to hear, isn't it? Now, can I just get back to work? I've been meaning to catch up with you alone. Unrestrained. You think Johns is a do-night man? You think I can trust him to cut me loose? Why? What did you hear? Well... Guess if it was trickeration, he'd just X me out, huh? He'd kill me. Then again, I am worth twice as much alive. Oh, you didn't know that? Your Johns ain't a cop. He's got that nickle-slick badge. And that blue uniform. But he's just a merc. And I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me, see? The creed is greed... Don't waste my time. We're not gonna turn on each other no matter how hard you try. I don't truly know what's gonna happen when the lights go out Carolyn. But I do know once the dying starts this little psycho-fuck family of ours is gonna rip itself apart. Ever wonder why Johns shakes like that? Ask him. Ask why your crew pal had to scream so painfully before he died So who are you really? You're not a cop, are you? I never said I was, Carolyn. No, you didn't. And you never said you were a hype either. You have a little caffeine in the morning and I have a little morphine. So what? Here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you born lucky. It's not a problem unless you're gonna make it. No, it becomes a problem when you let Owens die like that! You have enough drugs here to knock out a fucking mule team. Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to the fact. Is there anything else I should know about you, Johns? You know, I... I'm letting you roll the dice on our lives. It is not unreasonable... Do you feel that? That's my first run-in with Riddick. He went for the sweet spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there, Carolyn, and I can feel it pressing against the cord. So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve endings is my business. It's just that you could've done something, and you didn't. Well, look to thing own ass first, right, Carolyn? Captain! Captain! I'm not your fucking Captain. What do my eyes see? If we need anything from the crash ship, I suggest we kick on. That sand cat's solar. Where's Riddick? Leave him. He wouldn't wait for us. Thought we lost you. Johns. Hey! Where are you going? I've just gotta get a couple things. I'll only be a few minutes. You wouldn't leave without me, would you? How many are there? Beautiful. Allah. People. Just a suggestion. Perhaps you should free. Let's go. Come on, run. Jack. Come on. Get in. Get down. No... Shazza! Stay there. Stay down, Shazza! Just stay down! Come back here! Shazza, stay down! Please, I really think we should go inside. We have to be inside. We have to close the door. Come on, let's go! Let's go... What is it, Riddick? What is it now? Like I said. It ain't me you gotta worry about. She should've stayed down. If she only would've stayed down. She'd be okay. She wouldn't have died. You remember the boneyard? These just might be the fuckers that killed every living thing on this planet. What are we gonna do now? Are these the only lights we have? Is this everything? No, there's a cutting torch on the floor here somewhere. I just can't find it. Quiet! Please, everyone. Why do they make that sound? Perhaps it's the way they see... With sound, reelecting back... It could be a breach in the hull. I don't know. Come on, Johns. You got the big gauge. I'd rather piss glass. Why don't you go fucking check? I'm not staying here for one more second. Where are you going? Hey! Paris! Sit him down. You don't know what's out there. I know what's in here. Hurry. Now we're trapped in a much smaller space. I hate this! Extremely bad timing. Just don't run. Riddick? Don't stop burning. Take this. Take this. Okay. Hassan. Where is Hassan? Is it alive? It's like the light is scalding it. It hurts them. Light actually hurts them. Is that Hassan? We'll burn a candle for him later. Come on, let's get out of here. So we've got one cutting torch we've got two handlights. There's gotta be something we can rip out of the crash ship. Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns rather well. How many bottles you got? I don't know. Maybe ten. Okay, Johns. You got some flares? So... Maybe we got enough light. Enough for fucking what? We stick to the plan. We get the four cells back to the skiff. We're off this rock. Look, I hate to ruin a beautiful theory with an ugly fact but that sand cat is solar. It won't run at night. So we carry the cells. We drag them, whatever it takes. You mean tonight? With all those things still out there? All right, now how long can this last? A few hours? A day, tops. I had the impression from the model the two planets were moving as one and there would be a lasting darkness. These suns gotta come up some time. And if these creatures are phobic about light, then we just sit tight, and we let the sun come up. I'm sure somebody else said that. Locked inside that coring room. We need to think about everybody now. Especially the kid. How scared is this boy gonna be out there in the dark? Don't use him like that. Like what? As a smokescreen. You deal with your own fear. Why don't you shut your fucking mouth for two seconds and let me come up with a plan that doesn't' involve mass suicide I'm waiting. How much you weigh, Johns? What's it matter, Carolyn? How much? Around 79 kilos to be exact. 'Cause you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat and that's why you can't think of a better plan. Is that fucking right? Where you going? This solves nothing. Okay. They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them. And you are sure you can get us there? Even in the dark? No, I can't. But he can. Stay close... Wait... Riddick? Looks clear. You said "clear". I said it "looks clear". Well, what's it look like now? Looks clear. Be running about ten paces ahead. I want light on my back, but not in my eyes. And check your cuts. These bad boys know our blood now. Are we actually gonna do this? We stay together, we keep the light burning. That's all we gotta do to live through this thing. Are you ready Johns? Mmm... Look, we're just wasting light here. You give him the cells... and the ship, and he'll leave you all out there to die. He'll leave all of you. I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddam valuable in your life that you're wormed about losing? Is there anything at all? Besides your next spike? You must stay close. Wait. Jack. Sulei! Jack! That can't be happening. Paris! Get back here. Are you all right? This can't be happening. I was supposed to die in France. I never ever saw France. Well, it's good to see you're okay. Do I even want to know? Are we getting close? Can we pick up the pace? You want to tell me what the hell's going on. We crossed our own tracks. Why have we circled? Are we lost? Listen. Do you even know where we are? Listen! Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think. I think we should go now. I don't know about that. That's death row up there. Especially with the girl bleeding. What? What the fuck you talking about? She's not cut. Not her. Her. You gotta be kidding me. I just thought it'd be better if people took me for a guy. I thought they might leave me alone instead of always messing with me Why didn't you tell me? I'm sorry, sweetheart. Are you really bleeding? You could left me at the ship, Fry. That's how come I didn't say something sooner. I would never, never... They've been nose-open for her even since we left in case you haven't noticed, they go off blood. Look, this is not gonna work. We're gonna have to go back. What did you say? You're the one who got us out here in the first place and turned us into sled dogs. I was wrong. I admit it. Can we just get back to the ship? I don't know. Carolyn. Nice breeze, wide open space... I'm starting to enjoy my fucking self out here! Are you high again? Just listen to yourself, Johns. No, no. You're right, Carolyn. What's to be afraid of? My life's a steaming pile of meaningless shit anyhow. So I say mush on. The canyon's only a couple of hundred meters, and after that it's skiff city. So why don't you butch up, stuff a cork in this fucking kid, and let's go. She's the Captain! We should listen to her. Listen to her? When she was so willing to sacrifice us all? What's he talking about? This does not help us, Johns. During the crash... she tried to blow the whole passenger cabin. Tried to kill us in our sleep. Shut your mouth. We are fucking disposable. What is he talking about? We're just walking ghosts to you. Shut your fucking blowhole. Fine. Fine. You've made your point. We can all be scared. Oh, Carolyn. How much do you weigh now? The verdict's in. The light moves forward. Ain't all of us gonna make it. Just realize that? Six of us left. If we could make it through the canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a feat, huh? Not if I'm the one. Well, what if you're one of five? I'm listening. What are they doing up there? They're talking about the canyon, I suppose. How to get us through. Battlefield doctors decide who lives and dies. It's called "triage". Kept calling it "murder" when I did it. Either way I figure it's something you can grab onto. Sacrifice play. Hack up a body, leave it at the start of the canyon. Like a bucket of bart. Trawl with it. You got extra cable on the sled. We drag the body 40, 50 feet behind us. Nice embellishment. Well, I don't wanna feed 'em I just wanna keep 'em off our scent. So which one caught your eye? No, no, don't look! Christ! What the hell's wrong with you? Imam, slow down. Just a little more space between us and them. All right. Enough of this shit. You do the girl and I'll keep the others off your back. It's not too big a job for you, is it? I'm just wondering if we don't need a bigger piece of bait. Like who? Leave the sled! Let's move! Let's go. One rule. Stay in the light. Remember that moment. You should have never taken the chains off, Johns. You were one brave fuck before. You were Billy Bad-Ass. The chains. The gauge. The badge. I told you to ghost me. Back to the ship, huh? Just huddle together until the lights burn out? Get away from us. 'Til you can't see what's eating you? That the big plan? Where's Johns? Which half? We're gonna lose everybody out here. We should have stayed at the ship. He died fast. And if we have any choice about it that's the way we should all go out. Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare. Blind spot. Shall we pray together? I have already prayed with the others. It's painless. It's pointless. Because you do not believe in God does not mean God does not believe in you. Think someone can spend half their life in a slam with a horse-bit in their mouth and not believe? Think he could start out in some liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, and not believe? You got it all wrong, Holy Man. I absolutely believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker. He is with us, nonetheless. Two of your boys are already dead. How much faith do you have left, Father? Only see one way. That way. It's the only way off this rock. Just keep the girl between you. What about the cells? I'll take those. Move. Are you sure you can keep up? Move. Do not look up. They're killing each other. Move! Keep moving! Sule! Sule! Riddick! Wait! Riddick! Get off her! Get off her! It's okay. Did not know who he was fucking with. Get up. Suleman. Come on, get him up. Sule, come on. Get up. Oh no. So where the hell's your God now? Riddick! Are we close? Just tell me that the settlement is right there. We can't make it. Sule! Hide here. Now. Why is he still out there? He's not coming back, is he? That's the last I could find. Strong survival instinct. I admire that in a woman. I promised them that we would go back with more light. Did you? Are you afraid? Me afraid? Come on, Riddick. There's got to be some part of you that wants to rejoin the human race. Truthfully, I wouldn't know how. Then just give me more light for them. I'll go back by myself. Okay. There you go. Please just come with me. I got a better idea. Come with me. You're fucking with me. I know you are. You know I am. You don't know anything about me. I will leave you here. Step inside. I can't. Sure you can. I can't. Here, I'll make it easy on you. Take my hand. Come on. Come on. No one's gonna blame you. Save yourself, Carolyn. Come on. Come on. That's it. Good girl. Now, you... You listen to me. I'm the Captain of this ship. And I am not leaving anyone on this rock with those fucking things, even if it means. Get that thing off my neck. Shut up! You'd die for them? I would try for them. You didn't answer me. Yes, I would, Riddick. I would. I would die for them. How interesting. Never had a doubt. Anyone not ready for this? There is my God, Mr. Riddick. Don't stop... Come on! Move! Move! You know the way. On board! Come on. Get on. Carolyn. Come... Wait. Riddick? Okay, hold onto me. We're gonna get outta here. Okay, I got you. Come on, Riddick! Get up! Get up! I said I'd die for them, not you. Let's move. We're nearly there. Come on. All right. Not for me. Not for me! With so much prayer to make up for, I scarcely know where to begin. I know where I'd start. Riddick, what are you doing? Can we just get the hell out of here now? We can't leave without saying goodnight A lot of questions, whoever we run into. Could even be a merc ship. So what the hell do we tell them about you? Tell them Riddick's dead. He died somewhere on that planet.
