Thought I told you not to run them sheep on my land! My land, Garrett. Became mine when we signed that lease. He's right, Mr. Garrett. I'm paying you off when we get back. And I'm breakin' that goddamn lease. I don't allow the law would agree to that. What law is that? The Santa Fe Ring law? Shit. Goddamn law is ruining the country. Whoa! Ain't you still a part of that law? There's something wrong with that harness. I believe they elected you and paid you good wages for killin' the Kid, huh? You rotten son of a bitch. You try your luck, Eno. You miss more than anybody else does. I'll bet on it. Jesus Christ! Get down. Damn! That's Garrett! Hello, Bill. That's pretty fair shootin' for an old married man. Just lucky, I guess. How are you, Kid? -It's good to see you. -Good to see you. Hey, Billy. Who's this you got with you? -You're lookin' good. -You havin' some kind of fiesta? Hello, Black. No, we always live like this. You ought to visit us more often, huh? Well, I reckon the whole damn territory's gonna be one big open jug for us now. Is that right, Pat? Ain't that right, Pat? Take a two-day ride from Lincoln just to pay me back the $2 you owe me, Pat? Better collect it now, Black. We ain't gonna be seein' much of Pat these days. I understand those Mexican senoritas are still pretty as ever down there. Yeah? I know one's waitin' on you, hoss. With a knife. Remember them sisters? No. Which ones were they? That one you got up and asked her how much you owed her. And she said, "Whatever you think it's worth." You threw her a dime on the pillow. The girl said, "If that's all it's worth, I might as well sew it up." Son of a bitch. Come on. I'll buy you a drink. Think it's okay if he's too good to drink with us, do you? Maybe it's the other way around. Jesus, don't you get stale around here, Bill? Maybe a year or so down in Mexico will do you some good. I didn't figure you'd bother to make the ride out here. Shit, you know me better than that. You heard about Evan? He drowned in the Rio Grande... ...tryin' to get back to that old Mex you were talkin' about. He took two of the posse with him. I'm sorry to hear that. I always liked old Evan. At least he knew when it was the right time to leave. We did have some times, didn't we? It's gotta be pretty hard to turn your back on all that, eh? You want it straight? If that's what you're here for. The electorates want you gone. Out of the country. But are they tellin' me, or are they askin' me? I'm askin' you. But in five days, I'm makin' you. Because I might take over sheriff of Lincoln County. Old Pat. Sheriff Pat Garrett. Sold out to the Santa Fe Ring. How does it feel? It, uh, feels like times have changed. Times maybe. Not me. Hey. Why don't you stick around? We got a few days left, ain't we? No. I gotta get back. Adios, Pat. Adios, Bill. Don't press your luck. I'm not worried about my luck. Why don't you kill him? Why? He's my friend. ¶ They say that Pat Garrett has got your number ¶ So sleep with one eye open when you slumber ¶ Every little sound just might be thunder ¶ Thunder from the barrel of his gun ¶ The businessmen from Taos want you to go down ¶ So they've hired Pat Garrett ¶ To force you to slow down ¶ Billy, don't it make ya feel so low-down ¶ To be hunted by the man who was your friend? ¶ Hang on to your woman if you've got one ¶ Remember in El Paso, once, you shot one ¶ She may have been a whore, but she was a hot one ¶ Billy, you been runnin' for so long ¶ Get on up, Billy. You hear what I'm sayin'? Yeah! I ain't makin' no money watchin' you boys sleep. Like to waste the best part of the damn day. Come on, boy, let that squirrel loose! You like to shake it to death. I'm just scratchin'. Chisum's cattle's waitin' on us. Ah, let 'em wait. I hate a son of a bitch that gets up noisy and full of himself. I ain't in this for my health, hateful. That's awful. Old Pat ain't gonna like this. What? Comin' down hard on him. Day after he got his new badge. Hell, ain't no way he's gonna know. I ain't afraid of Pat Garrett. Well, all right, a little bit. Bastards! I best go get them horses watered. Goddamn Chisum. How'd he know we was here? Hell, that's Garrett. God damn him, too! Now he's got Bell and half the town of Lincoln out there with him. Help me up. Oh! Sweet Mary's ass. No. Let me go down. If they kill me, I'm gut-shot for sure. Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Hold it! Bill! Come on out! You don't have a chance! What are you takin' me in for? Which one was that? Buckshot Roberts. For the killing of Buckshot Roberts! Hell, that was a year ago. I shot him straight up. Come on in, Pat. I'll warm your breakfast. Guess he ate. They're closin' down the store on us. For sure. Maybe it's time you took a walk. Hell, yes. Why not? I can still hold a gun. We gotta move. I'm goin' fast. Kid. Ow! Sweet Mary's ass. Oh! I'm goin' now, so by God, let's get on with it. Hey... I ain't afraid of him now. Hold your fire! We're comin' out! Hold it! You go left. I'll go right. Might be they ain't circled us. Might be dog would've caught the rabbit, if he hadn't thought shit. Where are the goddamn horses? That's enough! Hold it! Hold it! All right, Kid! Come on out if you're still alive! Game's over! Comin' out, Pat! ¶ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ¶ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ¶ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ¶ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ¶ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ¶ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ¶ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ¶ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ¶ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ¶ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ¶ You're in poor company, Pat. Yeah, I'm alive, though. So am I. I never figured to hear you brag on bein' a workin' man. I never figured you for the law, either. It's a just a way of stayin' alive. Don't matter what side you're on, you're always right. And I aim to live to be rich, old, and gray. That's a fine ambition, Pat. You keep thinkin' like that and I'll keep thinkin' on how I'm gonna spend your money. The only think you got to think about, Mr. Bonney, is when you stand before the highest court there is. May it sit in judgment on your rotten soul. Now, you listen. Listen to me good. Just before that rope snaps, it's gonna hit you like a bolt of lightnin' that what I been tellin' you is the truth. Now, you'll learn to believe before I'm finished with you. Three to you. What do you believe in, Bell? I do believe I'm gonna have to see that bet and raise you five. Billy, somewhere in the Good Book it says there's a time for everything. A time to love, a time to hate. A time to kill. But now it's time you got close to God, boy. I heard God's fast. I have to go up in front of him myself before I bet on it. You will. Well, that puts me on my way. Go out and collect a few more taxes. All yours. Two days, boy. I count eight days till dawn, Billy. Best be on your knees and make an acquaintance of your Lord and master. Pat, keep that mule's asshole away from me before I have to break him. I surely wish you would try, son. I got my shotgun full of 16 thin dimes. Enough to spread you out like a crazy woman's quilt. Bob. Why don't you sing the song of Jesus while there's still a way? Bob. Bob. Damn it. You mess around with him one more time, I'll have to send your ass back to Texas. Don't. Think I'd like to keep him here a while. I fold, Billy. Foldin' three queens now, are you? You must be afraid I'll go out a loser, Bell. I guess I just ain't seein' 'em. Well, I tell you what. As long as I'm still breathin', let's just play it straight up. I ain't sold my saddle like you and the rest of the town boys, Bell. It's just Bob that smells like street shit over there. On your knees. Kiss my ass. On your knees! Bob! Repent, you son of a bitch. Sweet Jesus, I repent. Leave off, Bob! You've gone loco! I'm going across the street and have a drink. I'm thirsty as hell. I want to tell you one last thing personal, Kid. It's gonna be a loose rope and a long drop. That last thump got my guts going. I need to go to the outhouse. My horse loco'd on me once comin' back from Pacheco. Had to cut the second bar in his mouth and bleed him. He died on me, and I ended up walkin' 40 miles. I never was much for walkin'. Well, I ain't never walked a mile since, I'll tell ya. Fell in with a bunch of Mescaleros. They was just off the reservation and I was suspicioned of 'em. But I had some biscuit on me and I give it to 'em and they just rode off. That's a hell of a story, Bell. You know, I believe old Pat's lost his sand. He won't come on a man. You oughta not talk about him that way, Billy. You and him used to be pretty close. He ain't the same man. He signed himself over to Chisum and every other goddamn landowner that's tryin' to put a fence around this country. Hell, that's what you been doin', ain't it, Bell? Sellin' us out and gettin' fat? Ain't that easy, Billy. Now, you was a friend of Carlisle's, wasn't you, Bell? You know I was. I don't mean to be contrary. I ever tell you how he died? Shot him three times in the back. Blew his goddamn head off. I don't want to kill you, Bell. Well, now, I sure hope you don't, Billy. Then just move toward me. Don't. Don't do it, please. You wouldn't shoot me in the back, Billy. What the hell was that? There's been a shootin'. Oh, my God, he's got a shotgun. How's Jesus look to you now, Bob? Bonney's killed Bell! Yeah, he's killed me, too. Keep the change, Bob. Bring me an axe. Get back. I don't want to kill you. I want you to go over to that livery stable, get me the best horse you got. Si, senor. ¶ I been to the Rio Grande ¶ And the Rio Chama ¶ And the Rio Pecos ¶ Rio Montana ¶ I been to Santa Fe ¶ San Antone, Tularosa ¶ I been every goddamn where ¶ Fort Sumner ¶ And Espanola ¶ San Pedro ¶ And I been to White Oaks ¶ Ojo Milagro ¶ Might've spent a night at Matamoros ¶ Takin' chances ¶ But I never seen no town low-down ¶ As Lincoln ¶ And I been to Texas ¶ Arizona ¶ Colorado ¶ With your daughter ¶ Marijuana ¶ Across the border ¶ She was laughin' like a devil when I caught her ¶ But she was smilin' ¶ When I left her ¶ Brought you a horse, Billy. Try him again. By God, I think I'm just gonna trade you that fine brown horse for your buckskin. What the hell, Billy? I'll throw in about $1.60 worth of change if you can dig it out of old Bob there. ¶ There's guns across the river ¶ Aimin' at ya ¶ The lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch ya ¶ Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get ya ¶ Billy, they don't like ya to be so free ¶ Campin' out all night on the veranda ¶ Dealin' cards till dawn in the hacienda ¶ Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send ya ¶ Billy, don't ya turn your back on me ¶ Playin' around with some sweet senorita ¶ Into her dark hallway she will lead ya ¶ In the shadows of the mesa she will greet ya ¶ Billy, you're so far away from home ¶ Whoa. Would some of you people get him up off the ground and into it? Anything you say, Sheriff. Hell of a mess, Pat. Shot Bell and Ollinger and rode on out. Yeah. Do me up good this time, Giuseppe. And leave the mustache on it. Boy around? Boy. Speak to Mr. Garrett. Yes, sir. I want you to run all the way down to my house, tell Mrs. Garrett that I'm gonna be home for dinner. And then I want you to stampede-like over to the courthouse, find John Newley and all the other boys that are standin' around over there and tell 'em to come over here and pay me a visit. Got that? John Newley, courthouse. Yes, sir. Who are you? That's a good question. I believe you know of me. Bill Kermit. Wanted for horse thievin' down in Seven Rivers, ain't you? That'd be me, Sheriff. Killed old C.B. Denning last year at Silver City for calling you a cheat at monte. That'd be me. Alamosa Bill. Well, Bill, I'm gonna make you my deputy. Listen, Bill, why don't you go out back, find us a couple of steaks and a mess of eggs. And get one of them good bottles they got behind the bar there, huh? I want to have me a bath. It should take you about two weeks to make a circle. Yeah. They say William Bonney has escaped. He has. And he's in old Mexico, I hope. Where we should be if I had any sense. If not, I'll go after him. Got too much riding on it not to. I figure that's why they elected me. Anyways, I don't give a damn. I brought him in once, I can do it again. If I have to. You might say that you are glad to see me. It's been over a week you've been gone. I'm sorry. I've got to go down to the saloon. There's a drunk down there causing a lot of trouble. Goes by the name of Alamosa Bill. Said he rode with the Kid down in West Texas. Will you be blessing this house with your presence for dinner? Oh, it looks like it's gonna be a long night. It's been a long year. Not now. My people don't talk to me. They say you are getting to be too much of a gringo since you've been sheriff, that you've made deals with Chisum. You don't touch me. You are dead inside. I wish you'd never put on that badge. -Not now! -Si, ahora! Or I won't be here when you get back! We'll deal with this when it's over. I hope he gets away. Well, he won't. There's too much play in him. And not enough in you. You're late, Pat. Uh, more cognac, please. -Good of you to come, Sheriff. -Thank you, Your Honor. -It's a pleasure to see you. -Thank you, sir. May I offer you some supper? Oh, no, no. I think I might have a little of that, uh, brandy, though. Of course. Some brandy. I do hope you enjoy these rainy New Mexican evenings. They have a fabulous melancholy to them. They bring us closer to some greater design. At least I hope so. Uh, allow me to introduce Mr. Lewellen Howland. And, uh, this man is Norris. These, uh, gentlemen are very concerned about the escape of William Bonney, a concern, I'm sure, you also share. Escaped from my jail. Exactly. This territory is vast and primitive. There is money here, growing investments, and, uh, political interests. We must protect these investments so that the area can continue to prosper and grow. I believe you rode with the Kid, didn't you, Sheriff? I did. Then you must be aware of his moves. Well, I know Billy, and he ain't exactly predictable. Oh, come, now, Sheriff. For a man who's half outlaw himself and still smart enough to be elected sheriff by Chisum and the other big ranchers, I expect better than that. Now, can you bring him in, or should we look elsewhere? Oh, I can bring him in. If you want the big peckerhead to still mess things up by starting another cattle war. I can assure you, Mr. Garrett, that Chisum and the others have been advised to recognize their position. And in this particular game, there are only a few players left. I'd advise you to grab on to a winning hand while you have a chance. We're offering a reward of $1,000 for the Kid's capture. You can have 500 now. Well, I aim to bring the Kid in. But until I do, you better take your $500 and shove it up your ass and set fire to it. Commendable notion, Sheriff. ¶ There's eyes behind the mirrors in empty places ¶ Bullet holes and rifles in their cases ¶ There's always one more notch and 10 more paces ¶ Billy, and you're walking all alone ¶ They say that Pat Garrett has got your number ¶ So sleep with one eye open when you slumber ¶ Every little sound just might be thunder ¶ Thunder from the barrel of his gun ¶ Eno. Well, now. I'm gonna blow the top of your cow-humpin' head off, you son of a bitch. How's it goin', Luke? You are a son of a bitch. I thought they was gettin' ready to trim you, boy. There was a whole bunch of us just fixin' to ride in. I saved ya'll a trip. Or somebody did. I figured I'd lay back a few days. Maybe more. Well... It sure is pleasurable seeing you back again, Kid. Honey, aren't you glad I'm back? Welcome home, Billy. And did you miss me so much you had to take up with that low-down piece of old hide? Oh! Como estas, Silva? Buenos dias, Billy. Now, you're uglier than me. How's it going, Beaver? Eno, I thought you boys would be out in the Nueces or Colorado by now. Well, I figured to watch you get stretched, but I might've knowed you'd show up. Good thing somebody did. These four rode in here this morning. What's your name, boy? Alias. Alias what? Alias anything you please. What do we call you? Alias. Hell, let's call him Alias. That's what I'd do. Alias it is. Thank you. Whoa. My, my. You boys hungry? I didn't catch your name. Didn't give it out. Well, I guess that's why I didn't catch it. But I know yourn. And that's enough. Hey, Silva. You remember that meeting with John Jones and that old man they called US Christmas down there at El Rito? Old man they call US Christmas? Right. See? It seems John stepped on one of US' boots one night they was both in town. Old US, he been out huntin' buffalo for six months. Now, he was mean and testy and damn near blind drunk. He had on a pair of these flat heels, about half-length Wellington boots. Them boots was the only thing he owned he put any store in. And John stepped on one of 'em. That old man, he stood back and said, "Let's get to it." So... John said to US, "If you're gonna get that riled "over a pair of foreign, lady-lookin' boots, "we just might as well get the ball rollin'." So they went out in the middle of the street, and they took the 10 steps. And John put three holes right through that old man's chest. I must've known 'em from somewhere. It's too soon for bounty hunters. Alias. What the hell? Garrett? I thought you was in Lincoln. What the hell are you doin'? You get your ass over there, Gate. Howdy, Colin. Howdy do yourself. What you doin' with that piece of sheep dip? I'd like to blow his thievin' head off just for ridin' through my town. I ain't paid nobody no never mind. Been stayin' in my own good hole. Fact is, I'm thinkin' about goin' to Texas. Kid broke out. Killed Ollinger and Bell. Thought maybe Gate and some of the boys might have a sign on him. Well, I still want him for that train robbery up at Springer. Gate's been holed up outside of town here with Black Harris and Seth Coleman and that bunch. Been meanin' to roust 'em out of here, but somehow or other I just can't get around to it. I don't know nothin' about the boys. I don't know nothin' about the Kid. I understand you been ridin' for Chisum. I'd rather be on the outside of the law than packin' the bags for that town of Lincoln and them that's a-runnin' it. It's a job. Comes an age in a man's life when he don't wanna spend time figuring what comes next. Well, it's gonna cost you some change. I got to the point where I don't do nothin' for nobody unless there's a piece of gold attached to it. One of these days when I get my boat built, I'm gonna drift out of this damn territory. This town has got no hat size no how. Mama! Where'd you put my badge? I don't like it, Colin. This town is not worth it. To tell you the truth, Mama, I don't take a shine to it myself. Anytime you're ready. Company's coming. Sheriff Baker. Whoa! Hey, Black Harris! I want to talk to you! Whoa, boys. Ho. Black? I ain't seen the Kid, if that's what you're sniffin' after. But if it's straight-up one-to-one you want, then I'm your man. I'm lookin' for a sign, Black. Us old boys oughtn't to be doing this to each other. Ain't that many of us left. Remember? You and me rode into this county together. How long ago was that, Pat? Oh, hell, about 15 years ago. Pat? I know where the Kid's at. I'll tell you... ...when you're lyin' proper on the ground. It'll be the last words you ever hear. ¶ Mama, take this badge off of me ¶ I can't use it anymore ¶ It's gettin' dark, too dark to see ¶ I feel I'm knockin' upon heaven's door ¶ Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door ¶ Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door ¶ Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door ¶ Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door ¶ Hey, look at that. Look at them turkeys. Hey, hold them critters, Silva. Come on, kid, let's get 'em. Whoa, come on! Yee-haw! Yahoo! Watch this! Whoo! Come on! Get in there! Watch this. Whoo! Come on, Billy. Get out of the way, you son of a bitch! Grab it, Billy! - Hey, grab that one! - Whoo! Move, Billy! What you got there? I got me a turkey. Let me see that bird. Aw, I could have roped four or five of 'em in if it wasn't for you. Them's Mr. Chisum's cattle. And this is Chisum's land. Where you going with it, Silva? Get your rifle. -You want some coffee? -I could use some. Name is Poe. John W. Poe out of Fort Griffin, Texas. Maybe you saw me last month in Santa Fe at Governor Wallace's. The Governor made me a deputy. I think he probably told you. Already got me a deputy. Two is better than one. I answer only to the Governor, Mr. Norris, and Mr. Howland. I heard talk on the trail the Kid's in Mexico. Don't figure to me. Most likely he's trying to get his old bunch together again. -Which way we goin'? -I'm goin' southwest. That'd be the Chisum ranch. Chisum is a fine man. Country's gotta make a choice. Time's over for drifters and outlaws. They just got no backbone. Well, I'll tell you this once. I don't want to have to say it again. This country's gettin' old, and I aim to get old with it. Now, the Kid don't want it that way. Might be a better man for it. I ain't judging. But I don't want you explaining nothing to me, and I don't want you saying nothing about the Kid and nobody else in my goddamn county. Garrett to see you, Mr. Chisum. All right, somebody else try him. Yes, sir. Mescaleros stole 40 head of horses last week. Yeah, I heard they, uh, was off the reservation. And Bonney tried to steal a few head a couple of weeks ago. Well, he says you owe him $500 back salary. He rode for me. I treated him just like any other man. Sheriff, tell me something, why did you ride all the way out here? We thought maybe you'd heard something. Yeah, I'll tell you what I heard. Billy the Kid is in Tascosa. Billy the Kid is in Tombstone. Billy the Kid is in Mexico, Tularosa, Socorro, White Oaks. And Billy the Kid is at my table right at this moment eating tacos and green chili peppers with my niece, just like old times. -You staying for supper? -No, thanks. Mr. Poe? I... Yeah, yes, I could eat. Fine, bunkhouse is right behind the lodge barn. Men usually eat when the cook lets 'em. Interesting meeting you, Mr. Poe. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime. Glad to be of service, Garrett. But don't overuse it. I appreciate the loan. Are you gonna get him? Adios. My friend... Buena suerte. Until I see you. Come to Mexico, Billy. People know you're here. I say this as a friend. Hell, in old Mex he ain't gonna be nothing but another drunken gringo shitting out chili peppers and waitin' for nothin'. It's got a good edge. Gracias, amigo. Gracias. Adios. There's a lot of land between here and the border. And it's all Chisum's. Better keep those sheep moving or they're gonna end up on his table. I have no quarrel with Chisum. It is an old war that is over. Let him alone... And he will let you alone. Don't you believe it, my friend. I must believe it. Adios. -Adios. -Adios, Paco. Buena suerte. You could leave. You could live in Mexico. Could you? Yeah. I could live anywhere. I could leave anywhere, too. Have you ever been to California? Not yet. I ain't either. They're sure pushin' on me to go somewhere. Yeah, your leavin' would sure give Garrett some size. I reckon he's given me about all the time he can. Mexico might not be bad for a couple of months. Depends on who you are. I reckon. Mexico won't be so bad for a few months. I guess that depends who you are. But if I was you all, I'd be clearing out of here. Gonna be some hard times coming down. Remember me to whoever rides by. Boy, water for these horses. All right about the goddamn... Hello there, Lemuel. Well, if it ain't the limb of the law, Patrick J. Garrett. Your booze is under the bar where I always keep it. Shake it up. It's got a little oil on it. That's the fairest drink of whiskey you'll ever throw lip over, boy. Know you around these parts? I never rode through here before. Don't seem the best way to be trackin' a man down. They're already talking about you in Lincoln. I calculate you ain't been there in more than seven weeks. When I want somebody to keep time for me, I'll ask you. I'll stay here the night. You take that trail east and south. I'll pick you up in Roswell. Five days, six at the most. You might be able to find somethin' out there alone. You gettin' tired, Garrett? Looks like you only got a couple more days left in you. Yeah, well... Adios. You want yourself a woman? One come in here from Albuquerque, run the cathouse over there. Name is Bertha. Got an ass on her like a $40 cow, and a tit. I'd like to see that thing filled full of tequila. You know something? You can't beat that, can ya? Howdy, ma'am. Mr. Horrell. Hey, Tommy. Billy. Didn't think we'd be gettin' to see you. I felt obliged to come and pay my respects before moving on. Sit down, Bill. Picked a fine time to come, Billy. I sure never figured on you for takin' on a badge. Didn't figure on it myself. Was just in town being sociable. Rode in from Seven Rivers to watch you hang. Garrett swore me in when you lit out. Won't be having no ill talk at my table. Fill yourself, Billy. Another fried pie? Ah. Don't mind if I do. Never tasted anything so good. Thank you, ma'am. Billy. Tomato. I, ahem, don't suppose you ran into old Pat, did you, Billy? Can't say I did. He'll track ya down, Billy, and get ya. Pat Garrett's got more sand than most. Yeah, I'm outlawed for sure. Old Alamosa here'll see to that. It wasn't long ago, I was the law, ridin' for Chisum. And old Pat was an outlaw. The law's a funny thing, ain't it? Well, we best get to it. Just got through puttin' up that new cottonwood door. Used the old one for my son John. He got into a shootin' with Olin Carroll. He's buried out yonder there. I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Horrell. Oh, well... John was a good hand. Couldn't shoot, though. Harley, you and Reed give me a hand with this door. Don't suppose there's any other way we could work this out. Nah. Well, let's get to it. Ten steps? Suits me. You count 'em. You ain't thought of another way, have you? Naw, I can't come up with nothin'. Get to it. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... That wasn't 10, hoss. I never could count. At least I'll be remembered. Howdy, old-timer. Wasting the best part of your day. Hello, Holly. Bit off your graze, ain't ya? A bit. Hell, everybody knows he's lookin' for the Kid. Everybody knows the Kid ain't nowhere in this territory. Nobody's seen him. Maybe he be outside there wishing he could come in, get himself a drink. -Get himself a drink? -Mmm-hmm. Yeah. I had mine. No need to run off, Holly. He ain't out there, Pat. You boys better shed them gun belts. Just let 'em lay where they fall. Boys carrying wages? What kinda wages you mean? Hell, any kinda wages. Thought maybe we could just have a few... ...sociable hands. Ain't no harm in being sociable. Ain't no harm in being sociable. Boy, go over there to Lemuel and get that shotgun he's got his fingers wrapped around. Bring it over to me, stock first. Do it. Ain't no use in you gettin' a mad on, Pat. I wasn't set on usin' that. Those boys have been patronizin' me real well. No use gettin' a mad on, Pat. We been patronizin' him real well. Now I want you to stand over behind the brie here. Now, I want you to take the stock of that gun and rap him smartly on the back of the head. Now, you do it, boy, or this bullet that's goin' through his chest is liable to come out the other side and tickle your private parts. Private parts? Lemuel? -Yeah? You drag your fat ass over here so we can all see you. You crazier than a mule-humpin' goat. Sittin' there with all that law crammed inside of ya, just bustin' to get out. I wouldn't give a sweet jerk in hell if the Kid did lay you out. And you used to be just like a daddy to that boy. Boy. Come over here. I want you to take Lemuel's hat and stuff it down over his eyes gentle-like. Those eyes ain't seen nothin' but the bad news side of things since he's been in this territory. And I'm lookin' right smack dab at it. Now I want you to go over there to that shelf of airtights and give us a nice read, loud enough for us all to hear. Let's hear it! Uh, "Beans. "Beans. Spinach. Eastern... "Tongue. Beans. Beef stew. "Salmon." Two is a better game anyway, isn't it, Holly? Listen, Pat, we haven't done nothin'. All we did was come in and wet ourselves down. "Spinach." Take it right from the bottle, Holly. "Beef stew." No need to stand on manners around here. No, no, no. Go ahead. Have another one there. "Climax tobacco." -Hmm... -Just keep on goin' there. "N-K fine quality tomatoes." He's tryin' to drown ya, boy, that's what he's doin'. Trying to get his bark back on him. Figure it's gonna make him young again like the Kid. "N-K salmon. Beans. "Spinach and beans. Baked beans. "Beans." Boy, this sure lights up and kill you. "Baked beans. "Beans. - "Quality... "Quality... "Beef stew." Tell me, Pat. You afraid to take it to the Kid or what? Ever since you and the Kid have been together, you just been a little... A little short of supplies. You know what I mean? "Lima beans." Ah, hell. I, uh... I don't care about either one of you. "Lard. Quality, uh... Quality salmon." "Plums. Beans." You just made me have a bowel movement in my britches, Garrett. I ain't gonna never forgive you for this. "Succotash. "Beets. Spinach." Boy? When you see Billy, tell him we had a little...drink together. No! No! No! It's ready. Jesus Christ. You working for Chisum? Yeah. We're workin' for him. Hello, Paco. I will tell you about a house that I want to build now. No, not here. For us, amigo. It will be on the other side, in old Mex. I will sell my sheep, and I will build the adobe bridge myself. You know, Billy, I put a vine, a grapevine around the veranda, and I will have three chairs, and I will sit in the middle one. And anyone who doesn't do right, according to nature, and my mother, I will blow his head off. Billy, siento mucho frio. Como te sientes tu, Billy? Well, that ties it. I'm going back. Look who's here. Hey, look who's here! I was hopin' that was you soon as I seen your dust. Well, I was hopin' that was you. I ain't shut of this country yet. I should have knowed better. Beaver. Goddamn glad to see you, buddy. You boys look a little grim. You need somebody back here to spur your flanks, don't you? You just give us the word. There's enough of us left. Nobody's running us off. Not Garrett. Chisum. Or that goddamn Governor. Chisum killed Paco. Hello, Rupert. Take your old room. Key's in the door. Oh, Rupert, what ladies do you have hosting for you nowadays? We just got some sort of an octoroon from South Texas, and there's Ruthie Lee and Pauline. They'll all be up in Ruthie Lee's room. She won't be wantin' to see you. She's been with the Kid more than a few times, you know. Well, send her up anyway. You want another one? I don't care who you send up, Rupert. Just make sure that Ruthie Lee's part of the package. Come in. Hello, Ruthie. Which way do you wanna go? I don't know yet. Can I ask you a few questions first? He was here a few weeks ago. I don't know where he went. Gotta do better than that, Ruthie. You're gonna have to do me one more time, 'cause I owe the Kid that much. Now, you tell me... Fort Sumner. ¶ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ¶ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ¶ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ¶ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ¶ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ¶ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ¶ Excuse me. Clean it off real good, now. We're getting to the best part. You gotta pull hard there. They've been on for a long time. Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Oh, yes, where's that, uh... A little trouble there, girls? Jesus. Oh. What room is Garrett in? End of the hall. --Garrett? Come on in. Door's not locked. Well, where's he at? Fort Sumner. Yeah, well, I don't want to hear about that. If you don't get him, I'm going to. Go down to the sheriff's office and find Kip McKinney. Tell him to meet me downstairs. Don't say nothin' about nothin'. Ohh... Thank you, Rupert. Your jail empty? I recollect that it is. -Who's your deputy? -Zach Oliver. Already got the girls upstairs. Locked up. Take the girls over to see old Zach Oliver. Uh, give him the key. Go on. Give him the key. And then bring Mr. McKinney's horse back, will ya, Poe? Where we goin', anyway? Fort Sumner. There ain't nothin' out there but some old cattle thieves. Well, there's a couple of young ones there, too. Naw, I ain't goin'. You owe it to me. I do? For what? For not killing you over at Rosewater, for gettin' you this job, and not seeing you run out of this territory, for pulling you out of that snowdrift up at Chamas. And for cold-cockin' you over at Stillwater saloon last fall and savin' you from Rabid Owens bitin' off your ear and from just putting up with you for a hell of a lot longer than I ought to. Yeah. Well, I... I hope they spell my name right in the papers. -Billy. -Cut the dust. - Ooh. He's coming in, Billy. Yeah, I reckon. Maybe he wants to have a drink with me. Just as soon ride in, get it over with. He ain't gonna be there anyway. Hell, I don't have nothin' against the Kid. Savin' maybe he killed J.W. Bell. Yep. Sure did like J.W. We'll meet up on the other side of the fort at old Pete Maxwell's place. I know old Pete. Hello, Pete. Heard you were back. Obliged. We'd like to bed down in your extra bunk. No reason not to. I got no need for it. Been on any drives? No. Recollect a time when Toddy Sparks got his horse stole. Jace Summers stole it. Just up and stole it. Was up by Del Rio. Old Toddy got even, though. He sure did. Put a rattler in Jace's blanket. Bit him through the neck. Buried him in a thunderstorm. Summer of '71, it was. Man, what are you, some kinda frog watcher or something? Take it easy. I got the wrong room. You're goddamn right you got the wrong room. Who in the hell you lookin' for? -Somebody else. -What somebody else? Oh. It's cold. It's cold. Hello, Will. Hello, Sheriff. You finally figured it out, huh? Go on. Get it over with. Jesus. Jesus. Oh... Jesus. Oh... God. I'm hungry. I'll get you somethin'. No. I'll go see what Pete's got out in the cooler. That's the Kid. Right there. Go on. Shoot him. Go on. Shoot him. Go on. Shoot him. Who's that? Who the hell are you? Quien es? Hello, Pete. Evening, Pat. Easy. We come to see Pete Maxwell. You chickenshit bastard. Hey, Pete, who's that out there? I want his trigger finger! I want it cut off, I want it nailed to a post, and then I want him taken back to Lincoln. No! ¶ There's guns across the river ¶ About upon you ¶ There's a lawman on your trail ¶ Who'd like to surround you ¶ Bounty hunters are dancin' all around you ¶ Billy, they don't like ya to be so free ¶ Campin' out all night on the veranda ¶ Walkin' the streets down by the hacienda ¶ Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send ya ¶ Billy, don't ya turn your back on me ¶ There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces ¶ Bullet holes and rifles in their cases ¶ There's always one more notch and four more aces ¶ Billy, and you're playin' all alone ¶ Playin' around with some sweet senorita ¶ Into her dark chamber she will greet ya ¶ In the shadows of the mesa she will leave you ¶ Billy, and you're goin' all alone ¶ They say that Pat Garrett has got your number ¶ So sleep with one eye open when you wonder ¶ If every little sound just might be thunder ¶ Thunder from the barrel of his gun ¶ There's always another stranger sneakin' glances ¶ Some trigger-happy fool willin' to take chances ¶ Some old whore from San Pedro to make advances ¶ Advances on your spirit and your soul ¶ The businessmen from Taos want you to go down ¶ So they've hired Mr. Garrett ¶ To force you to slow down ¶ Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down ¶ To be hunted by the man who was your friend? ¶ Gypsy queens will play your grand finale ¶ Way down in some Tularosa alley ¶ Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley ¶ Billy, you're so far away from home ¶
