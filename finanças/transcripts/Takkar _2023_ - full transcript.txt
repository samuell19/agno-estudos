Every single man born on Earth… possesses self-worth and justifiable anger. But a man who wants to live with his self-dignity intact… should have either status… or courage. I have neither of these. A FEW MONTHS AGO… ROYAL SALON HAIRDRESSER Here, take it. Brother! Come here. Trim the sides short and keep the top at a medium length. Trim the sides short and keep the top at a medium-- Reduce the volume! Look at this photo. I want the same style. Trim the sides short and leave the top at a medium length, like this. Brother, do you want a shave as well? Keep the mustache. -Remove the beard. -Okay, brother. Brother, it's done. Get up and take a look. How is it, brother? You idiot! What did I tell you? What have you done? -Why are you hitting him? -Oh, God! Look what he has done to my face! Hey, what did you do? He was the one who said, "Keep the mustache, remove the beard." I followed his instructions and now he's hitting me, brother. He has done a good job. What is your problem? I swear… My mustache is here. Beard is down here! Is that so? You should have told him in Tamil. You not only confused him but also left me confused. And created an unnecessary problem. After all, it's just hair. It will grow. Don't worry. Hey, look. Your brother is here. Don't laugh. He'll hit me. Hey! Get lost! Don't laugh. I am extremely furious. Why be angry, Brother? You look very smart. Ignore my friends. How foolish of you to pay only Rs. 20 for a haircut and yet speak in English! You should have gone to a fancy salon that charges Rs. 100 or Rs. 200. Hair on one's head, if they're a millionaire, is pure gold. A poor man's hair is mere dust at our feet. Did you get the ground rice for the batter? What is this strange new look? Our entire lineage boasts of a distinguished mustache. Haven't you seen my mustache? It adds value to your uncle's appearance. Why is he lost in his gaze? I don't know which malefic effect of Saturn he plans to collude with. Shall I serve you drumsticks? What's the matter now? Sambar is delicious, so what is he sulking about? Why are we alone like this, Mom? Like what, Son? Poor, with no money. Struggling to make ends meet. But we are still happy. We don't have a decent roof over our heads. No car. Not even a door for our bathroom. I like it that way. How can you wish for the moon when you're born here? How does it matter where we were born, Mom? It shouldn't be like this when we die. Your grandfather was born poor. He died a poor man too. Your father was born poor as well. He died a poor man. Even you were born into a poor family, Son. But I won't die a poor man, Mom. Okay, eat now. Why discuss all that? I am going to Chennai. I will become a rich man. Tell me you want to earn good money. I get a bit scared when you say you want to become a rich man, Son. Why? Won't I become rich? You think I can't? I can become rich! Oh, my goodness! I named him Gunasekaran to ensure he becomes a good-natured person, but his anger turns him into a temper-tantrum king! Anger can also be a virtue. Junior artists, gather and take your assigned positions. Come here. When the director says "action," you must start walking, alright? Start camera! Background action! Action! Cut, cut, cut! Hey! Do I need to specifically say "background action" for you, man? No, sir, he asked me to walk when you say "action." Hey idiot, are you trying to be a hero, walking only when I say "action"? Walk when I say "background action." Mr. Director, it's alright. Let him walk when you say "action." With a little adjustment, it will look better. Okay, sir. As you say. -Start camera. -Rolling. Background action. Action! Cut, cut, cut! I said "action" is the cue to start walking. -You didn't tell me, sir -So what? Do you expect special treatment? You should be attentive, you bloody fool! Add two more plates. Sir, you won't be able to lift it if I add more. What are you there for? Go on, do as I say. -Wow! -Wow! Hey! Hey… Lift it higher, you… Awesome song, dude. All thanks to him. No… Why did you add ice? Don't you know I hate ice? I didn't know, sir. You didn't know? Now you'll know! Crap! Why are you glaring at me? Hey! How dare you! What do you think of yourself? Punch him in the face. What audacity! -Don't think you can manhandle me. -Hit him! You will pay for this. Anger can also be a virtue, but even that requires status. It's 98.8 Eli FM! Good evening, Chennai! I am your RJ Laddu, and I arrived right on time. You are tuned in to Eli FM 98.8, the only radio station where songs resonate in every nook and corner, inviting you to sing along. Listeners, from toddlers to grannies, in your lifetime, you would have never come across the playlist I have curated for you today. Do you know why? This show presents non-hit songs that we carefully select for your ears. We transform unheard songs into worldwide super hits! If you happened to stumble upon this song by chance, grab your phone immediately and dial 4378-5378. Share your unique experience of where you encountered this song. I am your RJ Laddu! Thank you, my dear 20 million listeners, for spending your precious time with me for the past two hours. I am now taking my leave, and my best friend, taxi driver Gunz, is waiting down below in front of our studio to pick me up. His ultimate goal in life is to become an instant millionaire, and even though he drives a taxi, he remains determined to drive a Benz. With his good academic background, he ensures people reach their destinations. While being somewhat ordinary, I host Eli shows for you. But we both occupy one seat, bringing ease to your mind and body. As life shapes your destiny, allow me to bid you farewell. See you all tomorrow. Until then, this is RJ Laddu signing off from Eli FM, where you can tune in -from every nook and cranny. -In every street corner and every nook and cranny! It's 98.8 Eli FM! Hi, dude. Even a man who desires to become a millionaire doesn't smile back at me. Dude, want a beer? No, thanks. Have you already had a shot? No. I talk into the mic from morning till night until I'm hoarse as a crow. I feel jealous when I come across someone like you, who speaks in monosyllables, dude. Dude, haven't you changed your car yet? I mean… how long do you plan to stick to this job? -I don't know. -Awesome, dude! How is it possible? Do you think a man who wants to earn honestly is an imbecile? No, dude. Such is your ambition. Your character and ambition are poles apart, like knotting a bald head to the knee, dude. So… do you expect me to sacrifice my self-worth? Definitely, dude! There are certain rules to follow to become a millionaire. You must adapt in any situation, face humiliation and insults, leave others in a difficult situation, pull the rug from under their feet, stab them behind their back or scratch their back with an agenda, exploit the town, fill your pockets, ruin an entire neighborhood, play politics with the state and nation, declare, "I don't care about anyone's well-being," and fly away to foreign shores. If someone spits on your face and asks, "Did you sell your soul?" you should be thick-skinned enough to wipe off the saliva, dude! Try this speech on the radio, and you'll receive nonstop applause. No, dude. Did I say all this for applause? It's a fact of life. This world has people divided into only two types, the dignified pauper and the corrupt millionaire. Why did you take this route? That's a roundabout way. This is the shortcut. Wretched fellow! This way will shorten our life. First, switch off the light. Switch off the light, you bloody fool. Climb up! Hey, get down. A new car is entering our area. Check it out. Some taxi driver has lost his way. Relax, leave it to me. Thank God we are still alive. -Why are you peeing in your pants? -They are the worst kind of rowdies. What do you mean? That's a hub of deadly rowdies. Murder, kidnapping, smuggling, hawala, drug dealing, and toppling the government. It's the hub for everything corrupt. How do you know? To boost my personal rating on my radio show, I went to record his voice without knowing he would break my sound box! Now tell me, was I justified in being terrified? Truly justified. Daily collection - four stars. Customer rating - four stars. Time management - three stars. Car condition - four stars. Driver behavior - two stars. Why is there a noise when you apply the brake? -Haven't you changed the brake pad? -No, sir. I will do it. Take good care of my car. -Okay, sir. -Go. Sorry. Excuse me. -The sky, in all its glorious totality -Thank you. It was definitely you You bloomed within me in mere seconds It was absolutely you It was certainly you ALBANIA Hey Raaz, I saw the photo. Nice girl. How much? -Three million. -Oh, God! It's too much. I need a discount. Hold on. What is the ransom amount? I am willing to pay whatever you ask. Please, do not harm my daughter. Sir, I am not a ruthless villain. Do not panic. I am a businessman just like you. I have bid three million for your daughter. No, no, no… Let me repeat, there is no need to panic. Now, tell me, what is your offer? Four million! -Four million! -Okay, Raaz. Let's finish the deal. Five million. I'll pay you seven million. I am even willing to pay seven million. What, Raaz? Please, man. Let's make it seven and a half million. Final. Hey! No, no, no. You shouldn't kick it like this. This is the Goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, blessing me through you. Apologize and pray. -Sir, share your final offer. -Eight million. Make it eight and a half million. I'll pay nine million. Nine and a half. Ten million. I will pay you ten million. Bring back my daughter safe and sound. Raaz, Indian girls are not in demand in the market. Understand my predicament. Ten million, going once. Ten million, going twice. Ten million… Not worth it, Raaz. Send her back to her dad. We'll do it some other time. Sir… Don't cry. You've found your daughter now. Be happy. Didn't I tell you? A deal is a deal. I am a genuine businessman. We will leave her at your doorstep, just as we kidnapped her. Cool. -Hello, Ponni. -Brother, I got into BSc Nursing. I have been asked to join next week, Brother. That's great, Ponni. I must pay admission fees and term fees when I join, Brother. I'll need up to one hundred thousand, Brother. Can you somehow arrange and deposit it into my account? Brother? Thanks, Brother. The cab is here. Come. Hey, get down. Go and sit in that car. OTP? It's 6139. Wait here. You have to take us back. Hey, get down. Take the bag! Inspector, grab him! Hey! Start the car! If you come near me, I'll stab him. Inspector, save me… Don't follow me! Come on, man. Move it, man. Quick, start the car. What are you looking at? Get in and drive. He won't cooperate. Let's get another cab. -Can't find any damn vehicle. -Make him start the car. I'll smash your skull! Start the car! I'll pay you. Help us escape. Look here. When life presents you with an opportunity of its own accord, instead of hesitating over its rightness or wrongness, it is not a crime at all to try your luck once. -How much will you give? -How much? -Fifty-fifty? -Deal. First, get in and drive. Let's go. Hey, police! Reverse… Hey, there's a traffic light, man! A white Benz is crossing the Indira Nagar signal. It's overspeeding. Block it immediately. Shift the barricade, hurry up! Hey! Barricade! It's a one-way lane. Heading towards Alandur. Block the car, sir. Why are you swerving to the left? Step on the gas. Speed up, faster! He's getting closer. Faster! A white Benz is overspeeding without stopping anywhere. Block that car at once. Over! Why is he flashing the indicator? No idea. Hey! What are you doing? Hey… Hey! Watch out for the truck! Thanks, man. Who wants your "thanks"? First, count the cash. Beat him to a pulp! My money. Give me the cash you promised. Run! Pay me the cash! I want my cash! Dump him! Dude, thinking you'll become a millionaire in just one day, you zoomed ahead in top gear! Straight to occupy the CM's chair, right? Dude, I'm not taking a dig at you. In this game of "How to Become a Millionaire," you've completed Kidnap Level One. When is Level Two, dude? I didn't kidnap anyone. Move aside. Okay, you didn't really kidnap. You've actually saved two rowdies who were in danger. Am I right, dude? If I were to receive just Rs. 500 for a ride from Adyar to Besant Nagar, and these two rowdies in a fix offered to pay me five million, I still consider it as a ride. -What's wrong with that? -Oh, I see now. In the end, will you only prioritize the money regardless of how you acquire it? Yes, that's how this world works. Have you ever wondered how your boss earned the salary he's paying you? No. -Then why should I be an exception? -To justify the mistakes we commit, we can find many so-called logical loopholes. But aren't there certain ethics for earning money the right way? Avoid taking shortcuts to fame and consider the risks involved, dude. Money isn't everything in life, right? I hope you enjoyed this show. Choose the right path or the shortcut, it's up to you. Until we meet again tomorrow, this is RJ Laddu signing off. Daily collection - three stars. Driver behavior - two stars. Car condition - four stars. Left side, above the bumper, there's a dent and a scratch. The scratch is negligible and not obvious. It can be fixed with polishing. Mark it. The scratch is negligible. Does it hurt? A bandage can fix it. Pay him for his hospital expenses. I have paid for treating your scratch. Now it's your turn to pay for treating my scratch. Putty, tinkering, painting, and polishing will cost a total of Rs. 18,000, sir. Deduct it from his incentive balance. Look here, all of you. Who is Raaz? Bloody scumbag, tell me! Who is Raaz?! -Are you Raaz? -No. Go! Don't you understand Hindi? -Who is Raaz? -Who are you? I will convey it only to Raaz. It's doomsday for you. You're still stuck in the past, carrying cartons and not moving with the times. Who is Raaz here? Why is everyone turning? Are all of you Raaz? Who is Raaz, man? Hey! Tell me. Your lips are sealed? I'll ask my dad. -Hello, Papa. -Yes, Son. Everyone here is acting dumb. I'll describe the men over the phone. -Will you listen and identify Raaz? -Okay. One guy here looks like a wild boar with a turban tied to his head. Another one looks like a Christmas tree. One resembles an also-ran in a second-rate film. Papa, there's a guy here who looks just like Kattappa in Baahubali. -How does he look? -Send two of them here. Collect the money as soon as you deliver… One minute. Reverse. You can't be Raaz. Dad, the Raaz you wanted isn't here. Should I return? Okay, you deal with my dad yourself. Hello. You stupidly lost one million in hard cash. In the situation we were stuck in, he asked for a 50-50 split. We negotiated and convinced him to bring it down to one million. Otherwise, all of us would be behind bars. Now do you know me? And my lineage? He's Bombay Varadharajan's son. This group has zero manners. Hey! Come here. -What? -How dare you take a dig at my boss? He is Raaz. Oh! Is that so? You had a narrow escape because he was preoccupied. Anyway, who are you? What? You have the gall to ask me who I am?! Shut up! Hey! Hey, Dad! Why are you going trigger-happy in old age? Do you still have bullets in your gun? When I was your age, I said the same words to my father! I'm not here to discuss that. -Then what? -If you continue to be a riffraff, there won't be anyone responsible to take over from me. Oh, he's acting like he's Pablo Escobar, the king of cocaine! And no one can take his place! Only you think you are royalty! No one has even heard of you outside these four walls. I've checked on Google. Even my face popped up, but there was no sign of your face! Something is fishy here, you conniving crook! Moron! How will you find anything about me if you search for "underworld don"? I live in a shroud of darkness, son. Even if you search with a satellite, no one can find me. You wouldn't be so rude if I had been stricter with you, my son. It's my fault. I pampered you way too much. If you continue to reside in Bombay, you'll end up as a riffraff rowdy. Go to Madras immediately. My disciple, Raaz, lives there. Go and stay with him for three months. Learn the ways of rowdyism in Madras and then return to Bombay. This is your father's order, son. I won't succeed no matter where I go, Dad. That's because I'm your son. I would prefer to stay here. Please. I'm not taking no for an answer. Otherwise, I'll destroy your credit card, debit card, passport, and even arrange posters for your funeral service. Dad, I will go to Chennai. If you don't mind, Dad. Wherever you are, your dad will always bless you. Hey "dynamo" face, I don't need your blessings. After Rosy was done smoking, she threw the cigarette butt here. You don't need to finish it out of habit. Rosy drinks with me and smokes a cigarette with my son. Is she striving for a "double reward" simultaneously? Tell Rosy I want to see her immediately. -Rosy is my girlfriend, sir. -Sorry. Don't expect me to be sorry. This isn't my fault. You guys decided and did everything yourselves. No one asked me if I was okay with it. And moreover, I don't believe this will work for us. Accepted. You know what this relationship means? You have to get used to it. In fact, "we" have to get used to it. You'll be comfortable as we get to know each other. I bet you'll definitely like me. I don't call that love. It's an adjustment. Where you learn to like it because of no other option. That's not the kind of relationship I want to be in. I can't think of this as my engagement ring. It feels like a circus ring to me. So please, let me leave. Hey! You cannot break this deal! Do you understand? Everything is signed. I have made your dad a partner in my company. So, don't try to do any bullshit! Then I suggest you marry my dad! He will give you a good deal. Sir… What happened, sir? -You bloody… -Please… -It's alright. -Let go of my hand. Sir, please. Calm down, sir. I'm okay. I'm alright. Hello, where are you? -I am waiting in the parking lot, madam. -I'm coming. Oh wow! My roadside Has now turned beautiful somehow Eight directions look at me And nod their heads wisely My unbroken sky of magic Now particles kaleidoscopic Lightning on the ground Slivers of silver all around Raindrops like never before drizzle In my heart's alcove encore Limitless joy alive within Tied as a swing swinging I die, drenched in bliss 24x7 I feel I am already in heaven A yearning unsated nestled deep Wilts away without fitful sleep Thorns pierce with strife Every breath of my life This tiny heart wistful craves for love Just a cupful Feet of my tears Tired of running for years A girl's normal wishes galore Washed into oblivion ashore Even the sound of silence in my mind Screams aloud unloved, quarantined I die a thousand deaths daily I changed "my keep." You keep my change. It's not happening, man. I can't get along with your daughter. What, Srini? How can you get tense too? She will come around in a bit, okay? Give me some time. Let me talk to her. I will talk some sense into her. You don't need to worry, okay? Lucky? What is it, Dad? What's the problem between Srini and you? Out! What?! It fell apart. -We broke up. -Why?! It didn't work out. Don't behave like a-- Like your mother. He's boring. Boring?! Do you even know who he is? The regenerative shock absorber he has developed is a groundbreaking invention approved by ASC. Do you even know that? He and I can't get along. We are not compatible at all. Please. Look… He's already done with his start-up. Do you know if his company and our Moto-Lucky merge, we'll be number one? Like organic food, this is an organic car. Organic is the trend now. Listen to me, Srini and you are getting married one week from now. I've spoken to him. He has forgiven you. He isn't holding any grudge. You don't either. Now say 'hi' to Srini. Hi. You like him or hate him, I don't care. You are marrying only him, okay? Cheer up, baby. Incorrigible! No one can reform you. You must pay the daily interest properly, okay? Thanks, bro. See you. I've thoroughly watched her movements. She has come by herself. If you say "yes," I can kidnap her. Tell me, shall I? Yes, do it. Hey, move. He messed it up. Don't stop. Drive! By the time all the formalities were done, it was morning. The car has to be junked for scrap. It seems only 40% will be covered by insurance. Why are you sitting here? -Go inside! -Come, let's go. You scumbag, bloody mongrel! While driving my car, whom were you gawking at? You jerk! The extent of damage on my car… should be equally inflicted on his body. Sign it. For the next seven years, you will drive my car without being paid. If you are unable to… send your sister to me! For four days, instead of food, eat crap, and then you will repent. A man who lacks the courage to die… won't have the guts, dead or alive. Life, when spoken of Will have a thousand things -Doors will open, and there will be pain-- -Damn this! Hey, what's up? You sounded so strange on the phone. You said something about suicide, and I panicked. Idiot! Sitting all alone and drinking. If you wanted company, I would have come right away. Why this unnecessary drama? Madcap. How did you get hurt? I might as well have a drink since I'm here. Hey! Is that poison? The bottle is half empty?! What about the rest? Oh, God! I can't even throw up in an emergency! Damn it! You wretched murderer! Couldn't you have warned me that you poisoned my drink? I'm scared to die alone, dude. Come with me. You wretched fellow! Are you going on a shopping spree? You're about to die, dude! Hey, stop it! What is so terrible that you want to commit suicide? They beat me severely. I feel humiliated and insulted. That's all? Don't overreact! I am so angry! I should have strangled him. But I didn't. Why?! Because for people like us, Look, how they have beaten me, but I didn't hit him back. Not a single blow. -Why couldn't I hit back?! -Hey! His car got wrecked in the accident, so he wants me to work for him without pay till my dying day. Then why should I live? I might as well die. I don't think I can do anything constructive in my life. I've tried committing suicide seven times since early morning. But I am unable to! I am scared. Scared of everything! You don't even have the guts to commit suicide successfully. I understand your distress, dude. You'll be fine if you eat a spicy kothu parotta. Let's go. Don't try to humor me. Are you amused by my lament? Where are you off to? Hey, dude! Wait! Hear me out, moron. Where are we heading? Tell me, man! Whizzing through narrow alleys, do you have any idea where you are going, at least? Why the hell are you…? Hey! Why did you come here? Isn't this the den of dangerous rowdies? Yes. If I provoke them into a fight, won't they definitely retaliate? They will chop you into pieces. That's my plan. What's wrong with you? Have you gone crazy or something? Yes. Don't agree with me right away. Take a moment to reconsider. I don't want to think. I want to die. I'm the one who lacks courage, but they are bold, right? Hey! Hunger is making you talk nonsense. Let's go to a nearby restaurant. Hey! It was stupid of me to think I should help you. Go away! He thinks he's entering the Bigg Boss house! Hey! Who are you? -Who are you? -What? How dare you! Hey! This is our area. It's mine too. I've never seen you before. You'll see me from now on. Hey, look at this guy. Take a fiver and leave. Otherwise, you'll unnecessarily be beaten up badly. If you want, I'll pay you. Take it and leave this area. I swear, I'm telling you! How dare you! -You deserve to die. -Hey, hey, hey! Stop it. Get back to work. Hey, get lost. You get lost! Now you are mocking me? I was treating you gently, and you're acting arrogant. Beat him up severely. Hit him! Harder! Kill him! Hit him! Punch him! Stomp on him! Don't spare him. He's not answering the phone. Have they already killed him? Jesus, help me. -Kill me! -Kill him! Close his chapter! Don't spare him! What was that, brother? Who is he? Master of deadly punches. Those two and I had a minor disagreement. You can keep hitting me. Hey! One quick strike. Go ahead, hit me. I can't control my hand. It's stopping you. What if I return the favor? It won't end well. I'll take my leave now. Do you think you can walk away unscathed after hitting our guys? You can bet on it. Bro, I'm just training. Please. He's as furious as Siddharth in the movie Boys! If you ask me how my fear vanished and how I suddenly became so courageous, even I am surprised. I have one simple answer. The sky's the limit if you dare to die. Yeah! Yeah! Every time you feel it right Girl, you gotta check and yield in my life This crazy player making it fly Girls be riddling! Cuddles all night Drop! You see me when these flashes pop Hoodies and classic dare dreams And you stop Winking at me as I am fishing these vibes Love is the sun You are the moon in the night Why do you feel shy? Mole in the right place Always soothing to the eyes Girl! Girl, could you come and hold my hand? Would you chill in the Libra land? Now you gotta get this time Half the time, half the time You go to doorstep Help! Life is akin to a game, where triumphs are rewarded with trophies. However, sustaining our winning position depends on our collision strategy. Every time you feel it right Girl, you gotta check and yield in my life This crazy player making it fly Girls be riddling! Cuddles all night Drop! Who was it? We don't know, brother. Why did he beat you up? We don't know, brother. Someone had the audacity to invade our territory and assault all of you. You claim to be unaware of his identity. Aren't you ashamed of yourselves? Hello, uncle. How can you lose your temper over this? He took your favorite Benz and parakeet and zoomed away. What is he saying? True, brother, he took the girl and your car and drove away. It took us six months to complete that project. -Brother… -Hey… Uncle, stop! Stop this. Stop hitting your boys. It's not their fault. You are to blame. I warned you the day I arrived, telling you to install a gate stolen from somewhere. How could he have entered then? Look at this damage caused by your negligence. I've seen ten buffaloes chasing away a lion in unison on the Discovery Channel. What's the point of having so many buffaloes here? He walked away unscathed. Why? Because your system is messed up. Catch! He would have dropped it. How will he catch it if you hog biriyani early in the morning? In Mumbai, we only eat salad. Morning exercises are essential. Only then can we stay alert. Our boys fight back! Here, they surrender to his blows and have no idea who he is. On top of that, you haven't installed a CCTV or a remote locking system. No hand grenades or pistols on hand. Being rowdy doesn't mean yelling "Oh" in a run-down jeep with four rusty knives. Cheating! Staying updated is crucial for a gangster. Technology is a must. Look at this. Face ID. Device unlocked. -Who am I? -Don Max. -What's the weather? -37 degrees. Please play music. Try identifying yourself. Face ID. Face not identified. -Face ID! -Monkey Face. No, not monkey face. Face ID, please. Donkey face. Who am I? Seems like a buffalo. Where's the weather? Device corrupted. Because you punched me, my face seems unidentifiable. Shut up and sit down. How can I keep quiet? You split my lip open by punching me in the face. Hello. This is Raaz speaking. Tell me, I know. Sir, I can't release your daughter for five million as we agreed earlier. Pay me ten million, and you can have her back. What? Ten million?! Sir, this is unfair! Sir, am I involved in a business where fairness matters? It's kidnapping, sir. Saving your daughter is a great responsibility. Don't overthink it. Fine, where should I come? I'll inform you about when and where in my next call to you. Don't take unnecessary risks, understand? Treat it as a deal between two businessmen. I'll hang up now, sir. Hey! The girl hasn't been safely delivered to her home. Her father's voice still sounds worried. I don't know what you will do. Split up and search for her in different directions. I need that girl back here. Tell him to bring the car. Do you want something to eat? Apple pie, egg muffin, pork sausage, chocolate truffle, zucchini hash brown, banana smoothie, and an Irish coffee. Are all of these items edible? For one meal? I bought idli for you with the money I had. Adjust for now. We can have lunch at your house, right? I won't go home. Then where will you go? You tell me, anywhere. I need a break. I had the same thought as I was driving. I felt like taking you somewhere, making you fall for me, and leading a happy life. But you are high maintenance, dear. I can't afford you. You can go. Then why did you rescue me? I like that! Why would I rescue you? In that gang war between them and me, I whisked away their car. You latched onto me. How am I responsible? Then take me back to that den. That's a terrible place, my dear girl. They will sell you to someone. It's okay. My dad did the same. The only difference is that this is monogamy, and that was polyandry. Comparatively, this seems better to me. At least I'll have my freedom. -Then I'll leave. -Yes, go away! I'll work at this idli stall and earn a decent living. I don't have money, girl. I have to sell my kidney even to buy you idli! It's alright if you don't have money. Excess money takes away your peace of mind. Easy for a wealthy woman to say that to a poor guy. Does that idli give strength to your words? Are you a communist? No, accused. Steal my chain, and you'll get cash. If you had told me this earlier, I wouldn't have wasted my time. Hey! You're not unhooking the clasp of my chain! Oh, sorry. He's not here. Should I take his mother and sister? Are you turning me into a thug? Go and find him. Okay. -Let's go find him. -Let's go. I've spent all the chain money, dear. -I'll drop you home. -Don't worry, I have a gold waist chain. It's inside, around my waist. Oh! And then? Then we take each day as it comes. We can't live life that way. I have my own goal. Earn money, and become a millionaire. Get in… Don't plan your life like that. Life will be too boring. None of that. Once the waist chain is spent, you can leave, okay? No, let's go on this fun ride all over town. This won't work. Do you have any other ideas? Then take a salary from me and roam around. That seems like a fair deal. How long? Until you bore me to death. What will be the salary? Whatever helps you become a millionaire. How? You take the kidnapper's deal. Just drop me off, and you'll get your ransom amount to become rich. Yeah! This hardcore player is on a roll! Every time you feel it right Girl, you gotta check and yield in my life This crazy player making it fly Girls be riddling! Cuddles all night Drop! You see me when these flashes pop Hoodies and classic dare dreams And you stop Winking at me… Didn't you get anything for yourself? -No. -Why? It was just enough for your long list! Be selfish, man. "Me first, others next." Selfish? Can't blame you. You've had a pampered existence. If you truly care about someone, you wouldn't behave like this. You don't even know me. Are you fond of me so soon? That remark wasn't aimed at you. But I already know you. Really? How? I've "window-shopped" you! Window shopping? What does that mean? Knowing I'll never get to have the goods. So, just looking. Oh! So you're going out of your way just to impress me? You're thinking in second gear, my dear. I have no such intentions. What now? Do you want me to pick something from here? This will do. Not that. I'll choose. Catch. Who is he? Can't even get a single clue. What is he buying from that student? Why are they buying a gun? They don't know how to shoot anyway. Uncle, be careful while sitting. Your gun might go off. Pass it to the boys. BROTHER DAWOOD I've sent Dawood Bhai a friend request five times. No response from him. I can see four legs on top of the cot. -Why, man? -Scumbag! If you keep indulging in adult videos, how will you become a gangster? -You'll only be a hustler. -Bro will hear, be quiet! Why be scared? He must have gone through this stage too. Give it to me. Mop head with mud inside! Watch this. Watch it till the end. Hey! Have you seen this? Snake playing with a baby. A snake will never harm a baby. Because they share a connection. Look how the baby is drawn to the snake. Now the baby is on the snake's neck. Did the snake react? Not at all. But it is glaring. Now it has slithered into the bush. Uncle, would you like to sit in the back? Oh, God! -Uncle, don't hit me. -Sleazebag. I'm damn tense and you're browsing Facebook. -Uncle, phone-- -Shut up and sit quietly. He slapped me so hard, and they're enjoying it! Lunatic uncle. Don't forget To always wear your stylish confidence Whether you shine or sag Don't lose your swag He hides his face with innocence But he's Hyde in every sense He hides his face with innocence… You have no choice but to endure this internship for three months, Raaz. Between you and me What is this strange bond? Tell me! Hello, boss. Did you see this car? No, I didn't. Bro, did you see this car? I didn't see it. Did this car pass by here? Old model red Benz? It didn't come this way, sir. -Red? -Yes. Blind fool. Green! Sir, this isn't green. It's a red car. Look properly. What color is this car? Green, brother. Green, brother. Green, brother. Red, brother. -Was it red when it was with us? -Yes, brother. Uncle, this is called color blindness. Like night blindness, this is a color deficiency. To put it simply, our brain identifies all colors with RGB as primary colors. In God's creation, the human brain has two sides with different functions. The left side and the right side. One whose right brain is active will see the color green. One whose left brain is active will see the color red. If both sides are dimmed, it will appear blue. If everyone sees it as a different color, how do we find the car then? It's not a matter of one or another. Let's all look for a green car. Only he can look for a red car. Keep it and give it to me only when I receive a call. Eli FM! Who can compete with my sweet friend? Where did you disappear, my dear friend? When my hosting is unbearable, I wonder how you can tolerate my singing. Remember my friend Gunz who picks me up and drops me off at work or home? He has suddenly vanished from the face of the earth. So, today's topic is "Your missing friend." Where is he sitting, and with whom…? How did you know I like this brand of alcohol? I just knew. Until now, no one has known my likes and dislikes. No one bothered to find out either. Would someone ask you, "What type of alcohol do you prefer?" Turn around. It is said that it's good to take a break in life. Seriously, the aftermath of a break is awesome. Am I the sacrificial lamb for your favorite pastime? For many decades, it has been my wish to dress a male up as a female. Are you so vexed with men? Yes, I'm a feminist. What does feminist mean? Eating the leftovers of your husband's food. -Oh! -What "oh"? Why should women bow down to men? Who said so? Hey! All you men are the same. My father will force me to marry some fool to develop his own business. My husband will relentlessly torment me forever! Bloody kidnapper-scumbags in between will get rich using me. What do you think I am? Do I look like a brainless bimbo? Everyone should be bashed. Every single fellow. Do you intend to bash them? You have to do the honors. Don't worry. We'll send everyone to their graves. I was thinking that only money grants happiness in life. I don't think even if I get that money it can buy this kind of undiluted happiness. My life's second half… is my better half. What did you say his name was? Srini. A name that deserves a bashing. Who are you? You aren't allowed inside. We are going to be the first in India to launch this, -and we need to take special-- -Srinivas? Who are you? What do you want? -Hi, I'm Gunz. -Sorry? -One second. -What do you want? -What the heck? -Light… Who are you? Who the hell are you? Yes, sir. This is "before." This is "after." Hey, catch them. Colors amplify in a rainbow glowing New thoughts plowing In my dreams, mind-blowing Heart melts, however To play chess with fervor Yesterday disappeared A new tomorrow appeared The coppery-orange sky Is a street to fly high Feet without blinkers on dancing To the rhythm of this song Future is like a mirage, illusive Hereafter distance to cover is elusive Dance with gay abandon This is a deserted island Look in eight directions Halo of reflections Move and groove with the band This is a deserted island Look in eight directions Aura of emotions Lines of the brow see a new meaning Flash of shyness in cobra eyes gleaming Heart was hijacked by the highway flower A train chugs Into the fifth sense with fervor Grey clouds turned white Left a vacuum empty and light My quest without you incomplete, dude I am a model blessed with a fortune I am unique Not a photocopy of anyone Brow to toe I am a lovely statue With the best of everything I am a mocktail glam doll darling Dance with gay abandon This is a deserted island Look in eight directions Halo of reflections Dance with gay abandon This is a deserted island Look in eight directions Halo of reflections What happened? Nothing. Unburden your stress Why this distress? Let Google search &amp; unfold Put the world on hold In the roots of my hurt and pain A few drops of blood still remain When I see you, my pretty miss Blood becomes a soothing kiss If you come close to me My fears vanish in a jiffy I don't share this with anyone either I came here of my own accord Do we set any limits, dear? Any lock can be opened It's time to run freely Even a second that lags Shown by the clock's hand dutifully Any lock can be opened It's time to run freely Even a second to benefit If the wick is lit Celebrate victory to the fullest Who are these Gurkha fellows? They have come to collect the money I owe them. Wait, I'll settle my debts. What is this? It's my resignation letter. GET LOST… If you beat us to a pulp, you will earn your freedom. Just by eating bland noodles, if you have the audacity, imagine my boldness when I savor spicy kothu parotta. Shred him into pieces! Tell me, what's the matter, my dear? Step aside, don't come near Don't lay a finger on me I'll readily turn you into mincemeat Don't attempt any tricks Or you'll find yourself in a fix I am also a prominent figure in the city These chicken-hearts Are unaware of my true identity I got into the car With the ferocity of a tiger Ask your lackeys about my power Don't sheathe your claws at me, kiddo You caused me trouble And now I'll put you in your coffin Turn the car. Turn the car. Listen to me, just turn. Why do you want him to make a U-turn now? I saw the green Benz. Where? Not here. Over there. -Where the hell? -Uncle, go back three kilometers. Idiot! Why didn't you speak up before? Because you can only make a U-turn here. Turn! Make a U-turn! Go! Speed up! He's gone. We don't know where he might have turned. You missed a golden opportunity. Hey Vaidhi, what's happening? Lucky's phone is unreachable. -Where has she gone? -Srini, relax. There isn't much time left for her wedding, right? She wanted to spend some time with her friends before the wedding. Nothing to worry. Let me just call her and come back, okay? Hello? What happened? Where should I come? Bloody scoundrel! Why did you call me? Did you kidnap your girl, or did I? I call the shots. Until then, just keep quiet. Otherwise, you won't see your daughter alive. Is this a cat-and-mouse game? She said she would be back in two days. -You be relaxed, okay? -Okay. -Hey! Come here. -Boss. -Who are we looking for? -The girl, boss. She just vanished into thin air. If you happily eat and sleep in the car, how will you find her? Blind as a bat, scumbags! Just run for your life! Hey! Give me your spray. -I have work to do, sir. -I'll give it back. Why? Don't you like me? I don't like "love." Why not? Because such a word doesn't exist. Love is nowhere. Hey, wait. What is your basis? So what do you mean by the word love? I really like you. I'll shower love on you. I'll do anything for you. I'll take good care of you. I'll expect you to reciprocate all this. That's how we behave now anyway. Why bring in this new word "love"? I don't have a clever way with words like you do. But I love you. Okay, go ahead and love me. If it's only one-sided, why should I even tell you? What do you expect my response to be? Confirmation? Won't you befriend a girl without any expectations? I want to marry you. I want to spend my entire life with you. So you want me to sign a contract with you? Do you say all this deliberately or out of sheer hatred? I don't wish to suffer from being trapped in a lifelong bond that feels like a prison. I want to live life on my own terms for my own happiness. Look, if you just want to have sex with me, then let's do it and forget about it. I can't stand this nonsense of love and marriage. Is that how you are? What do you mean? You don't understand the difference between love and sex. As far as I'm concerned, they are the same. If love is a starting point, then sex is the end. If you study life deeply, this is how crazy you can become! Will you believe me If I prove that I'm right? You can't prove it… to me. I thought you would refuse. Look at how I made you follow my lead. But even I have to prove myself to you, right? My love for you will never change. Shall we make a bet? -Sure, why not? -What's the bet? If I don't change, you should always be with me and marry me. And if you change? We will bid our farewells. Book a room. Hey, stop the car. Hey! Is that car green or red? Red, brother. Red, brother. Red, brother. And what about you? Green. It would have been great if it were green, but it's red. Sir, the bill. Hey! The car is moving backward. Why did you come? I forgot my bag. Why are you rushing now? I forgot the most important item. One double room. Married or unmarried? Won't you give us a double room if we say we're unmarried? I won't give it to you if you're married! Wait, baby. Enjoy! Thanks. Complimentary! I hope you haven't installed any CCTV cameras inside. Why do I need a camera? I can feel that! You are impossible, man! You look like that old Kamal from the movie Indian. But indulging in anti-Indian activities! I'll deal with you later. When the sun sets at twilight When ego and pride surrender in delight When you and I become we Is this love unconditionally? A lingering glance to consume the fire That was conquered at night When you and I become we Does love's holy water ripple gently? When words get tongue-tied Is caressing your language redefined? Distance yearns for proximity Are you love's soul mate for eternity? How strange! Bro's flag is waving here? Brother? This is Oragadam Madhavan speaking. I know, tell me. Did you recognize me? Okay, are you here? Where are you? I can see our car here. Daddy! Hey! Oram, where? Brother, don't you know where you've parked your own car? Hey, Oram, tell me. Where is it parked? So, you're not here? Hey! Tell me where you saw my car! Highway Hotel. Are you sure it's my car? Don't I know our car? Model 1199. The only difference is that it has been repainted. -What color? -Red, brother. Left brain. -Hey, Oram. -Yes, brother. Do me a favor. Go into that hotel. You'll find a girl and a boy there. Catch hold of them. I'm coming. -Hurry. -Catch them? I left your kind of job because I was scared of my wife's sharp tongue, and now I'm selling vegetables for a living. Are you trying to push me back into your hustling ways? Hey! I'll give you four lakh rupees, man. All I asked for was 400 rupees for my wife's birthday. You refused outright, and that's why I left you. As if you'll pay me four lakh rupees today! Boss, do you think you can involve me in your dishonest activities? Not possible, boss. Impossible! Damn you, moron! At least puncture the tires! Brother, I promised my wife I wouldn't engage in such antisocial acts. I shouldn't even have called you now. Sorry, God bless you. Get lost. As soon as I get home, I must destroy this phone completely. Don't worry, uncle. It's 15 kilometers. Hotel Highway. Tiffin? Uncle! Coffee? This feeling… somehow something new to me. You ask me if this is love. I really don't know. But I have felt this way with my mother. Don't overdo your act. I agree. You haven't changed at all. Even if you know it's an act, that's what all of you like! Gunz. Whom do you like most in this world? My mother. Hey! I would've said this even before our intimate encounter. You are a different breed. One girl, one boy. Which room? They flew away. Shucks! Go in and check anyway. -A chick broke out of the shell freely -Who is that old Kamal Hassan? The elephant's baby… Brother. Bingo! Playing hide and seek with me. I'm coming. You came here to have a good time? Why feel shy and hide that from me? Oh! With the whole gang? You are a holy terror, boss. What would be my plight if I had listened to you and punctured that tire? Thanks to my promise to my wife, your car tire had a lucky escape. Car? By the way, where is our car? I told you to puncture the tire… Hitting someone or the other is his favorite hobby! Let me check today's update on Facebook. I lost ten million of my hard-earned money. You can't earn this even if you bend backward for a lifetime. Hey uncle! Hey! Leave it, man! -Uncle, leave it. -Move aside. Hey! Look here! Look! Who is he? He is the RJ who came to do research. You even beat him to a pulp. Then who is he? He is the one who thrashed us. Then if this jerk "Jerry" is caught, our problem will be solved. You catch whoever you want. Let me go back to my work. Drag him into our car too. It's getting late, eat fast. You're always late for school. -Did you serve yourself sambar? -Yes, I did. On your way to work, drop her off at school. Okay. -Jerry? -Sister, some aliens will be knocking at our door now. Tell them I'm not at home. No, tell them you don't know me. Better still, tell them I'm dead. Laddu, what are you doing? What's wrong with him? Whom is he terrified of? Where is your brother? He didn't come here. No, I don't even know him! No, he is dead! I think she'll really nail my coffin and garland my photo. Is he dead?! Yes, his photo has been garlanded. Brother, take a look. He's really dead. Let's go. Go and search inside. Where do we look for a corpse? Go and search. That's how you ask a question. That it makes you kill yourself. You should be ashamed… Is he hiding here? I found milk here, brother. Should I ask her to make tea? Brother? Just watch me search high and low now. Where are you, man? Uncle, I've turned the room upside down. He isn't here. Let's go. You are hopeless at "I spy." My uncle will always hide behind the desk. Sorry, uncle, I never thought he would hide in such a traditional way. I got it! Bro, I don't even know how to hide properly. Please let me go, brother. Please, brother… Excuse me. Where should I come? I'll tell you in two hours. But I have raised the price. What the hell! Do you think I'm a fool? You keep increasing the rate as you wish. Why are you losing your temper? I had to invest more time than I expected. The amount should be worth it, right? Hence this hike. I know how to protect my daughter. To hell with your deceptive tricks. Hey… What a surprise! Hi, dude. What a pleasant surprise! Hello? Dude, are you okay? Top of the world, man. You had lunch? Yes, man. Where are you? Dude? I won't tell you. Why, man? My life has just begun humming a joyful melody. Why do you want to know my whereabouts? You showed me the hideout of those lousy thugs, right? That was the turning point in my life. Listen, you didn't meet the main boss that day. If you had met him, you wouldn't be so flippant. You beat them up and disappeared. Look now, they have captured me. Hey! They are such pathetic losers, man. You're giving them too much hype. I was able to defeat them completely! As if you can't. Do I need to witness this pitiful sight? Why be afraid of them? Punch them in their noses. Don't be so mean. By the way, that annoying mop-head will mess with your phone. That's me? Aim for his damn mouth. Truck tire! You're dead meat, man. And this gang has a boss! How can he be competent? He will be even more of a fool! Try hitting him. He'll take it lying low. Brother, I'll call you later. Hey, listen. Must be an important errand, sir. He will call back, sir. What happened? Tell me. This feeling blossomed inside me. I can't just label it as love. But I don't want this feeling to fade away. I want it to bloom like this forever. Good morning, everyone. My name is Don Max. This is one of the universal tortures happening in Chennai. And I'm the hot topic. Feeling excited. I will soon become a gangster. -Hey! Are you ready? -Boss? -Ready. -Bring him here! Give me a hand, boys. There's a traffic jam at Gemini flyover. Whether the movie at Sathyam Theater is good or not, don't show off your usual radio jockey nonsense. You must emphasize it with deep emotion, got it? What is it now, man? Dude, do you have a girl with you? Yes, she's with me. Bring the girl and the car back to the same spot you drove away from, dude! Do you think you are Kamal Haasan? Listen, lessen your crying tone, and express your emotions sincerely. Pep up your emotions. Your sobs should be heard only in the background. Hey, wait. Action. Dude, please cooperate. Tell us where you are. Please let us know. Otherwise, it seems they will… kill me and bury me, man. I can't bear their torture, man. They are hitting me in the mouth. Bring that girl back, man. Hey! I can't comply. Should I file a complaint with the police? Don't take such extreme steps. Then don't call me again. They will trace my location through your phone call. I will change my number and call you if I need anything. Bye. Sir, please give it to me. I'll try calling him again. -Catch… -Please give it to me. Please, sir. -Greet us! -Do it. If you had complied when your friend asked, this game would have been over. I had to use the Joker card for you to understand that I mean business. If you don't bring that girl here, in the next video, he will run in his birthday suit! I'll bring her. Shall we go? Okay. Don't you want to know where? I'll follow you wherever you want. Pack this. What is your plan, sir? Teddy bear. A desolate stadium. I'll tell you. Should I tell you? What? I'm in love with you. Sorry. I didn't know any other way to save my friend. Didn't I tell you? You will change. Either way, you are safe. Because you have the money. But we don't fall into that category, right? Hey! Send the girl. First, you send him. Go. I won't go. Listen to me, Lucky. Don't mess it up, go. -I won't go. -Why don't you understand? -We will be caught because of you. -Hey! Are you sending her or not? I'm telling you to go. Then accept that you lost our bet. I'll go once and for all. We don't have time to discuss your lousy logic. I'll come to your house and take you, go. I won't go. -If I go-- -Hey! Get lost! Who cares about a damn bet! Yes, assume that I lost the bet. Go now. When the girl comes to our side, shoot him. Okay. Close his chapter. Bro, get in the car. Get in the car. Hey! Stop the shooting. Hi Raaz. -It's a surprise. -Always. I think his act has begun. You manage with your apprentices. Finish him. Hey! Oh, God! Hey, here. Take the money. I'll take the girl. Oh, God. Sorry. My mistake. Where shall we go? Take me to my dad. Wait here. I'll be back. Hey, guys. Thanks a ton. Lucky told me everything. Ask me whatever you want. Keep this for now, okay? Is this tit for tat? Wasn't this our deal? This is just your salary. Don't play games with me, Lucky. Introduce me to your dad. What, Lucky? Who is he? What is he trying to say? Nothing, Dad. He's just a friend. Hey! Oh, sorry. Friend? You could have told me earlier. Sir, let me give you some more. If you want to humiliate me, think of something else, Lucky. Not in this manner. I have some self-respect too. How does self-respect come into this? How does it matter what the issue is? You won't understand, sir. Forget it. Lucky, don't waste my time. Next week is your wedding. I have too much to do. Don't worry, Dad. I'm okay with it. Why are you getting tense? Then send him away fast. Tell me, Gunz. What else do you want? Don't take a foolish decision in haste, Lucky. Will you ruin your life to pamper your ego? This isn't ego, Gunz. This is pain. But nothing terrible happened, right? All is well now, right? If something had misfired? Am I a scapegoat? Did you think of my friend at least once in that situation? Dude… In the same situation, why didn't you think of my plight? Don't be immature, Lucky. In that situation, you should have given only me all the importance. I should have been your first priority. Only then our bond will work out. When you didn't give me a priority, then you'll never do so in our life. How is that possible, Lucky? I've known him for 25 years! Then only after 25 years I will be your priority? You've already made up your mind. How can I convince you? Life is filled with small moments we like to cherish, Gunz. I bundled up my old life, shrugging off all the luxuries I had. When I decided to go away to some godforsaken place, you walked into my life. You made me fall in love with myself. When I decided to surrender my love and myself to you, for embellishing my life, you made me introspect again. I don't know if that moment will ever be recreated in my heart. What, Lucky? You fell in love with him? I tried, Dad. Shit! Okay? Anyway, thank you for everything. You made me really happy. Especially that hotel night. It was unforgettable. What?! You had sex with him?! Fucking expensive again! Kindly keep this between us. Go. Go now. What are you trying to say now? I'm saying, let's break up. You can go. It isn't anything new to lose in life. But knowing I won't get anything in life to keep wishing for the moon is my biggest blunder. Like colors of the rainbow You make my life glow The moment I don't think of you I won't get the comfort of your true love That sublime pain lasts A lifetime within me My vision was deviously scratched Shadows burn on the ground obliviously Memories play hide and seek Without taking a peek at the truth Words suppressed, hearts merged in bliss Mind and body surged in synthesis Don't leave me, my dear My heart can't beat if you aren't here Don't dig my grave, Ms. Temerity Don't act donning a fake identity I absorbed you in me, from head to toe I hid you in the alcove of my heart I pretended a bit, masking my love Like colors of the rainbow You adorn my life with a halo The second I don't think of you I won't get the comfort of your true love That sublime pain lasts A lifetime within me Kaleidoscopic colors Fleeting moments of magic Colors elusive… Love's magic, elusive Hey! She's getting married today. Why are you telling me? I'm getting married next week too. She spoke rashly and impulsively that day. Does it look nice if you also compete with her? Even now, if you convince her, she will come with you. Why should I go and talk to her? If she changes her mind, let her come. Touch your heart and tell me you don't feel terrible. No. You claimed she has a bloated ego. You are the one on a bloody ego trip. If one of you gives up this stupid ego, you can have a wonderful life together. Forget it, dude. How will it become any better? Don't put words in my mouth because you have no topic for your show. Tell me where you need to be dropped off. Park Hyatt. I didn't bring you here to create any sentimental nonsense. She invited me, and I honored it. The rest of what I said is my duty as a good friend. That's it. At least come in and wish her well, dude. Please, dude. Hey! I fought with the hands of time To rewind to yesterday's sublime path I delved into my mind Reversing endlessly to the words You rapturously blabbered I asked lightning for the selfies lavished When I slept in your lap Feeling cherished I thought the leaves' stomata Would archive the sound of our still lips You walked into my life real quick Like the flame on the candle wick Wonder why you ate into the wax stick You snuffed the breath from my life I will survive this sudden strife Why can't you notice anymore This love crawling on the floor? Why not iron out the creases By discussing our differences? Will our time together, love-kindled Disperse as an unfulfilled dream? I absorbed you in me, from head to toe I hid you in the alcove of my heart I pretended a bit, masking my love Hello? Sorry. Don't be mad at me. We can seal a lifetime deal. Yes! Including that. Why did you come now? The same question holds true for you. I didn't come to see you. I came to drop him off. Then why didn't you drop him off and leave? Why did you stand there and cry? Then what? Do you expect me to giggle like you? I came because you should laugh too.
