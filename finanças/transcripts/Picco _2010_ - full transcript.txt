English subtitles in memory of Hermann H. This film is based on recent events in various German youth detention centers. The plot and characters are fictional. "No matter who you trust it will be abused" "We give you a home for your future" "When I die I will go to heaven, what I had will be left behind." Kevin, Andy, Marc, and Tommy. What's the first thing you're gonna do when you get out of here? I'll go see my old friends, of course. I haven't heard from them lately. - Lazy bastards. - Absolutely. I'm going to get something decent to eat. Pizza. Anything tasty, man. I'm going away with my family. For a holiday. Yeah, man. Sun, beach. Everything, man. All-inclusive. - Including women, Tommy? - Of course. Where are you going? It doesn't matter, it's all about getting out of here. Turkey. My father's country. I'm going to have fun with my girlfriend and my friends. Lots of fun! Great. And a nice Jägermeister-Red Bull drink. Are you gay, son? Jack Daniels is a man's drink. Most importantly, I'm going straight to a beautiful woman. The quickest way. It's a good fuck in a brothel. Forget it, it's better with your girlfriend. Hey, Tommy, are you a pussy or what? Have you ever been to a brothel? The brothel is much more exciting. They take care of everything. They're not stiff like your girlfriend. - If only you knew. - Then tell me. - No man, it's private. - Tell me, man. No, it's personal. - Here is personal! It doesn't matter. I'm going to go bowling again. Strike! But it's so American. The rest is for fags. By the way, what are you gonna do when you get out of here, Picco? I don't know. I'll go to a movie or something. (Nickname for a new inmate, meaning "flunky".) This is our new kid. - Tommy, roll a joint, please. - No, I'm going to have a cigarette now. - Not enough weed. - So funny. - I agree. - That crap, it makes me sick. - Shut up, dude. That's really disgusting, man. - Going somewhere? - You're drooling. Spazz. - Tommy, roll me a joint, please. - No. Tommy, roll a joint. Tommy. Tommy. I got him right in the mouth. - No cannabis for two weeks. - Hold on, we'll see, dude. - Room service. - The best. Give me a doner with everything on it. Want butter? - Want some jam? - Yeah, don't ask me every time. Everything? Stop it, please. You're washing dishes today. - I'm not washing yours. - Of course you will. No, I won't. All the piccos do it, you will, or I'll hurt you. You'd better listen to him. Wash them now. Only once, understood? And wash them with love, okay? - Goran, get me some drugs. - You suck. Come on, pussy. Late, every night. I can't sleep with the window open. Hey Tommy, tell your nigger, Goran. Shut up, bitch. Shall I come up there, man? You goddamn window Rambos. Now your jaws won't stop . . . . . . but you don't have the guts to do shit tomorrow. - What are they for? - For sleep. - So he won't eat. - That's exactly what it is, Marc. Sissy Tommy. If you want some, tell your shrink. - Who? - Miss Schmidt, psychologist. Horny bitch. You're saying that because she's the only one here with a pussy. - Yeah, but what a pussy. - Like you would know. Imagine that we are all on a boat at sea. But we have a problem. Since we're too many and too heavy . . . . . . the boat is in danger of sinking. So one of us has to leave the boat. And now you have to decide whom it should be. But you have to give a reason. And of course, it must be logical. Understood? Bernd, you start, please. Of course, Miguel must go, begging me for cigarettes all the time. Fuck you, you spazz. No, man, Miguel stays here, he plays really good guitar. - Goran should go, man. - Dude, what are you talking about. . . . - He really needs to go. - Why him? Miguel, you have to give a good reason, or it won't count. - Yeah, he smells. - Yeah, my God. - You really stink, man. - That's bullshit, man. You smell, man. Fuck you all, man. Marc, you have to go. It's clear, man. You're too much stress. What did you say, man? - No, man. I'll stay here. - But if anyone should go, it's you. Yeah, or Tommy. Because . . . he's ugly. That's not a good argument, Marc. I'm sure you can think of something better. Yeah, but it really was good. No, no. I'll stay. He has to go. Kevin. Why? Because he's weak. He has to go. - See you later, Kevin. - Yes, dude. Get off the boat. This is bullshit. You're weak. I won't go. Andy must go. Me? Why should I go? Because you always talk too much. That's a reason for me to stay. Without me, you'd all be lost. - You go. - And why? Nobody would miss you. That's true, no one would notice if he went. Nobody here would miss a sissy like that. Those who think Kevin should go, raise your hand now. That's it! Of course. Because I'm new, right? Of course. Because you're a spazz. - Hey! Picco, give me your bag. - What? - The tobacco. - I can give you a cigarette. I don't want a shitty hand-rolled cig. I want your fucking bag, man. Then it won't be up to me. Like I really care. The first shopping day is Friday. This is shit. - It's shit for you. - What! When I tell you to give me the bag, give me the bag. Okay, dude, then take the damn bag. You son of a bitch. Day 3 Excuse me, do you have a cigarette? That's how you cut it open. Milk carton, Tetra Pak, then. . . - . . . whatever you can find. - You have a cigarette? Get lost, man. Anyway, you put the water in it. The first day was the worst. All day long until my fingers were ruined . . . - . . . I worked on the walls. - Do you have a cigarette? Piss off. Show me your fingers. It's getting worse. You can't do anything. They're completely ruined. But I cured it by taking pills. Do you have a cigarette? Sure. - I'm Kevin. - Julien. Thank you. How long have you been here? Three months. Do you have a light? Don't worry. It's normal for you to feel that way. The first days are the hardest. Getting used to so many rules and the loneliness . . . . . . is not easy. But you will get used to it. Don't worry. I hope so. You have to understand something: it's all part of your punishment. This is called educational punishment. We help when we can help you. But of course . . . . . . you have to do it yourself, understand? It's hard to accept, but you have to. But I don't want to accept it. That really destroys you. Excuse me for asking this question, but I've asked you before . . . . . . have you considered harm? You mean something like suicide? - Or just hurting yourself. - No, I never thought about it. Listen, let me know if it gets too bad. In case of emergency . . . . . . I can prescribe you medicine for depression or anxiety. But, of course, it's a last resort. Will you let me know? What is it that worries you? I just want to get out of here alive. - Which word is it, Bernd? - It's called a subject. Quiet! Bernd, which word? - Wrong, Bernd. - Bernd. Kevin. "Falls". "Falls". - "Apple" is the subject and the verb is "falls". - Thanks a lot. Bernd, you can sit down. - Mr. Draeger. - One second. Is there a letter for me? Look at this. Is this kindergarten or something? - A baby toothbrush. - Yes, dude. See if he's coming. No. Oh my God! Two or three rooms later . . . sees a nurse giving oral sex to a man. And he asks the doctor again: "What's wrong with him?" The doctor says: "His diagnosis is the same, but he has private insurance." - Didn't you understand? - Yeah, I understood, completely Leave me a sip. - What's so funny? - Nothing! How long have you been working here? A month or two. - Do you know how to deal with people? - Of course. Careful, dude. Sorry. Sorry. Spazz. Let it ferment for a few weeks, then we'll have a great drink. Great. Give me the other bottle. Why did you look at me like a faggot? - I didn't look at you like a faggot. - Come on, Hendrik. Shut up, stupid. Are you a fag or something? Are you? - No, dude. - You like that? - Fucking ass, you like that. - Stop it. No. You like that? You like that? - I didn't do anything to you. - What's going on? Hey! What's happening here? We were just chatting, Mr. Draeger. - Everything okay? - Yeah, it's fine. Then keep working, come on. "The locusts weren’t allowed to kill them, but only to make them suffer for five months . . . . . . and the suffering they inflict is like that of a scorpion when it strikes a person" Jesus, give me a break. That's the Bible. It's sacred. "People will seek death, but death will run away from them. Then the four angels will be sent to kill one third of humanity. Then another three-quarters will be killed by these three disasters. Fire, smoke, and sulfur." Andy, will you shut up? What? Marc, you really are a pussy, you know that? Man doesn't live here in peace. It's awful. How are you today, Andreas? - It's no use. - Why? Talking about it. It's bullshit. I think otherwise. It's important that you express your feelings. Tell me what's going on inside you, let it out. There are other ways to get this out of me. Attacking everyone is not a logical option. I think it's little different. What's the difference? You attack people and harm people. The same goes for words. Correct. But it's not physical damage. I hurt the soul with words. Isn't that much worse? This is true. But physical assault has brought you here. And that's wrong? - What do you want to say? - I just gave back the same. - Who did you give it to? - The whole system. What did the whole system do to you? I just want to do what I want, not what other people tell me to do . . . . . . my parents, my teachers, the law . . . . . . not what the whole system says. We can't live here freely. We can only grovel. This system is an attack on my freedom . . . . . . and I defended it. Freedom! Is that what you want? That's disgusting. - Give it back. That is none of your business. - Fuck you, you motherfucker. Hey, guys, you're not gonna believe this. Juli is a homo, ass licker. Here's his arrest warrant. It says here he's a whore. - Give it back. - Unbelievable. - That is none of your business. - He's a really bad whore. Give it back. Fuck off, fuck off, whore. Fuck, man. Disgusting, don't look at me. There really is a fag among us? - A prostitute. - You assholes, that's not true. - Don't touch me. - You like dicks? Give it to me! What's going on here, boys? Nothing. We were just having a little fun, Mr. Falter. They have my arrest warrant. You rat. And you squeal? Then give it back to him. - Now control yourself. - Yes, Juli, shape up. Shame on you. Shame on you. I would be embarrassed, if I were you. - He told us about the attack. . . . - What did he say? He said he was here for assault. Damn, you're sharing a bed with him. Yeah, really. I have to watch my asshole from now on. Tell the others, dude. Yes! Great! Give me the bag. There's really too much this time. Not too big. Rather like a plum. - Plum? - As much as a plum. Tommy. Yeah, and fat nipples. One can really suck on them. Mine has beautiful big breasts, a tight ass, and cute feet. Really great. Thank you. Is yours shaved? No, I don't like that. Mine doesn't shave no matter what I say. I think that's the Turks. After licking it, I always have hairs in my mouth. Yeah, classic. She has a beautiful pussy for that. Really tight. Really? My girlfriend's a little wide. After all, I'm not her first boyfriend. But, man, it sucks you so much that you get dizzy. What about you, Kevin? How is yours? Shitty? Why don't you say anything? It's just normal. Tell us about it. Too naughty? Can you do what you want with her? - She's a good girl. - So a real prude. - Does she get fucked in the ass? - Stop it. How boring. I think it's mostly old women who get fucked in the ass. That type of sex has to do with maturity. Absolutely. Mine's into sex toys. That's why she's taking private lessons . . . - . . . she's gonna be a porn star. - Shut up. I'm gonna fuck my girlfriend up against the wall. I'm gonna hurt her. You can't imagine it. - What about when she's on her period? - I'm a pirate. How so? Yeah, a real pirate "sails the Red Sea" too, doesn't he? - Net. - Serve again. Bad. Juli. Hi, whore. How are you? What's written in the arrest warrant isn't true. Of course. Then you wanna play a game of table tennis? Juli, why did you lie to all of us? I'm sorry, but what would you do? Let's forget it, okay? Kevin, are you coming to play foosball now? We need a fourth. Come on, please. I'll give you a bag. Come on. Or do you prefer to play with the faggot? Please, man. I'm sorry, man. Next time, okay? Mr. Draeger, I wanted to ask you something about next week. God, how it stinks. - Drop your pants. - What? Come on, Hendrik, stop this bullshit. Both of you go face the wall and shut up. He didn't do anything to you. Just go to the wall and shut up, or you're next. It's okay. Stop it, man, we've got enough problems. Kevin, don't look over there. - We have to do something. - Forget it, don't even think about it. We're going to be punished for not helping the faggot. If we squeal, we'll get another year or so. But it's still better than problems with that asshole. He's been here four years for manslaughter, man. He would fuck us, too? You want to be next? Dude, think again. Look at us, he'll kill us. - We have to do something. - No, Kevin. Think of something else. - It's a shitty situation. - Control yourself. DAY 27 What happened? Play with us. We need another hand. I don't want to right now, man. Stop fooling around, dude. Come on. Bastard. You're the bastard. Come on, play with us now, man. Never mind, we can play like this. No, four is better. Besides, you can sit there . . . . . . looking like a retard. Don't you like us anymore? Hey man, I asked you something. - Hi. - Hi. - Make it four bags? - No, let's do three. Four bags, when the food is handed out tomorrow. Not three? No. Have you ever thought about doing something to yourself? No. It was just at first, you're in a terrible state. Most people think about it. But not everyone tries it. Yeah. It was panic and fear. It was just psychological. - So you're better now? - Absolutely. Sometimes I get the feeling that something's coming . . . . . . then I take a pill and it's all right. They make you tired, but they help you sleep. Okay. I wanted to ask you, could you give me more of them? Thomas, you have to learn to manage without them. Absolutely. But it's almost over now, and it's just a precautionary measure. And this is our common area. - Good morning. - Hi, Mr. Reinhard. Hello. The inmates can watch TV here, football, baseball, play games. They can visit other cells, too. But only for an hour a day. Now we need a volunteer to show our guests their cell. Thomas, what do you say? We eat here, we don't have a cafeteria. There is a toilet and sink. The shower is somewhere else. We're allowed to shower three times a week. We also have a closet for everyone to put their things in. Television needs special permission. Well, these are our beds. Four of us stay here now. Group cells like this are no exception. There have been many incidents. Tell our guests why you're here. Perhaps you can give some advice to these young people about their future? No! - What's wrong with you? - No problem. Come on, tell me. He's normally quite cooperative. Maybe we should continue. Thank you. You've got mail. A DVD. Ah, here. Jessica Baldhuber. Your girlfriend? Yes. Is Bernd in his cell? - Have fun watching it. - Thank you, Mr. Draeger. See you. - Can I watch something? - I'm reading a book right now. - Come on. - How long it will take? - Five minutes. - Yeah, okay, hurry up. Yeah, but I want to watch it alone. Are you serious? Damn, leave me alone for five minutes, man. I'll give you a bag. Hey! Juli, I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry. I . . . didn't have a choice. I know it was wrong. Listen, man. Go tell the guards, the shrink, or someone. You have to report this, man. No problem for me, I'll support you. Dude, what happened there was really a load of bullshit. I just wanted to tell you that. See you later. Hi, Marc. I miss you. I hope you're good. I'm sorry I didn't contact you for so long. I want your . . . I mean, I'd like you to see this. After all, this is your kid. So . . . be good. There are two people waiting for you now. - Juli, come with me. - What do you want? Come on. Okay. Juli, you bitch. Show me your little penis. - Leave me alone. - Show us your little penis. Why don't you leave me alone? Show us your fucking little penis. - Baby penis. - Damn! - Bro. Dude, I can't believe this. - Falter, Falter, Falter. What's going on here? Nothing, everything's fine. Is everything okay? "Dirty Pig" Someone's morale is at stake here. Have you started weight training? So does it help? You can reduce some of your aggression with it. Well! You don't act like it, unfortunately. Look, Marc. I can't help you like this. It's confidential. I never asked you for help. I didn't ask anyone for help. But you need it. Urgently. A blowjob is what I need right now. Unfortunately, I'm of no use to you. - Pity. - What? Nothing. You want to get disciplined? - Come on. . . . - No? Then talk to me. - Okay. - Yes. Good. Then let's start again. How do you feel now? Stop this nonsense. You and that shitty nigger music. This is shit, Marc. You loser. - Yeah! What are you gonna do now? - Fuck you! You want an argument. - Children. - Come on. How about some silence? Just silence. Silence. You're all really getting on my nerves. Yeah, yeah, man. - That's just fine. - Shut up, Tommy. Behave! How's school going? It's actually pretty good. I'm with that girl at Lohmann now. The girl from Lohmann? The girl at the stationery store? I knew this would happen. You must know you're taking a risk. - That would mean more to her. - Because you're too shy. Keep reading. That is really important. Understand? Understood. You sound like my grandmother. Nobody's like our grandmother. She's a good woman. - You still doing bad things? - No. - Really? - Really. Good! Don't let me down, understand? Has anyone been in touch recently? Felix or any of the guys? Nobody? But I saw Felix. Two weeks ago in Malibu. He was pretty drunk. I spoke to him briefly. He didn't ask about me? - But he was drunk, wasn't he? - Of course. There are no real friends in life. - I want to go. - You want to go? With Bia. Waitress at Hexe, do you know her? Oh God! How long has this been going on? A while. We want to make a new start somewhere else. We want to forget all the crap here. Somewhere overseas. Where will you get the money? Bia has some savings. It's enough. One has to make some plans. So, what does Mom say? We haven't had much contact with her recently. - I guess she's not that happy. - Is she on drugs again? I don't know. Could be. Doesn't she write to you? So when do you plan to leave? As soon as we can. What about the dogs? That's the problem. We're not sure. You can't send them to a shelter. Of course, I don't want that, either. Just temporarily, until you get out. I'm not getting out for a long time. We'll think of something. I'm coping all right. - You're my sweetheart. Have you heard from Timo again? He hasn't written letters in a long time. It's been almost three months. I haven't heard from him in a long time. He hasn't been 'round since then. Why would he? Nobody comes to visit me anymore. Please call him. This is really important. Why he doesn't come or why he doesn't write? But I don't even have his number, Thomas. Do you have a pen? Yeah, but I don't know, I haven't seen him in a long time. Don't be stupid. It's the best thing to do when you leave here. Now that you're no longer on TV, you can leave the house. Please do this. Thank you. - I love you. - Me, too. I thought you'd never come back. At first I didn't want to come. I can't believe what you did. Even if you were drunk. Let's try to forget it, okay? Why don't you write me a letter? Mom and Dad don't allow it. They won't let me read your letters. - They threw them away. - What? They don't want me to see you. They think you're a bad influence on me. Right now, they think I'm at a job interview. I don't know how long this can go on. If they catch us, we can forget everything. What does that mean? What do you mean? Kevin . . . Uh huh! I can't come anymore, Kevin. No way. You can't do this to me. I need you here. No way. . . . No way. This is too risky. If we can't see each other, then we can forget it. Is that it? Is that what you want? No! Of course not. I can't make it without you. I need you. You think that's easy for me? They talk about you at school . . . . . . what do you think they're saying? About us, about me? In class. They're gossiping outside. It's like I've committed a crime. I really . . . don't know how this can go on. - What are you doing there? - What does it look like? "Hello, Mother." So funny. Stop it. Stop it! We just want to piss you off a little. Stop it, man. Hey! We're having a little fun here, do you have to stress us out right now? I want to write my letter in peace. We want to piss you off in peace. Come on, come on, come on. Here, here, here. Attack, man. - Dude, attack like a man. - Give me a break, man. Marc. Dude, Kevin's going to play badminton. - When I tell you to attack, attack. - You pussy. Shut up, dude. When I tell you to attack, do it. - What's going on here? - Is he completely out of his mind? Son of a bitch. You bastard! You son of a bitch! Have fun in isolation, asshole! What happened? What bullshit are they up to again? It's really ridiculous. What's going on? Goran. - Goran. - Goran, stop it! Yeah, man. What's going on there? What's happening? Goran says the faggot's going crazy, maybe he's gonna hang himself. Can't he do it quietly? - Is that really him? - Yeah, that's him. - He sounds gay. - Shut up, Andy. Bring him here. Who's that? Guard. It would be better for him to go away. Otherwise, things will go ape-shit tomorrow. Why? Hey! Can't you be quiet, spazz? At least a week in isolation for a suicide threat. - You're not serious, are you? - Ask Tommy. He's gonna fuck you. Fuck you in the ass. Juli, Juli, Juli, Juli, Juli! Can't you just shut up? Andy, what's going on there? Spazz, how do I know? Goran. What? - What happened? - Maaan. - Goran, what happened? - How would I know? Come on, shower. - What happened yesterday, Mr. Draeger? - A suicide. Juli? - He also wounded a guard. - How? Let's go. Come on. Kevin! Kevin, come on. Where is he? He's in the infirmary. Unfortunately, he was badly injured. So what are you going to do now? What do we do? We can't do anything. He's a dead man. You need to do something. I don't want people to commit suicide, You can't just watch it happen. Don't get me wrong, but unfortunately this happens frequently. There's not much we can do about it. Apparently, he was at the end of his rope. Come on. You have to help people. What kind of place is this? We're doing our best here. This is bullshit! Look at this. Your best is a load of shit. - It's terrible, isn't it? - It's our fault, man. Everyone here is responsible. Don't you understand that? Everyone has to watch what they're doing. It's that simple. Shit! You have to realize it's worth it. Get that in your head. - You don't understand, do you? - Are you a victim? Then stop acting like a victim, okay? You should look on the positive side. We don't have a problem . . . . . . and we didn't get another year for not helping. That's great! Listen to what you're saying, "That's great!" He killed himself. Tommy, you're a coward. I'm not a coward, I just know how to behave here. He's dead, okay? And we could've done something. You're a sneaky traitor. We'll see who's going to break down here first. Yes. Fuck you. Spazz. - You disgusting fags. - This is disgusting. - I'm gonna throw up now. - Then he'll fuck you in the ass. Let's continue our game. What's going on? You like that? - Are you a faggot, too? - Yeah, Tommy. Absolutely. - Absolutely what? - Spazz. Hey, guys, listen up. There's another faggot. Dear Kevin, he just confessed to me. Shut up, Tommy. I already knew you were a fag, Kevin. - You ass licker. - You're gay, right? So that's why you looked at me in the shower. I never looked at you. That was irony. You don't know what irony is? - Of course we do. - Irony, man. This is irony. Fuck off. Ass fucker. Congratulations on your appearance. Stop it, okay? I'm not a faggot. I'm not doing anything . . . . . . look at yourself. Shithead. - Yeah, but his ass is sweet. - Right? Great. Let's finish our game. . . . Day 49 It's a shit day, everybody. Shut up, Andy. The fate of man is a commandment from God. To submit to his will . . . . . . and to be judged accordingly. Conscience is the most secret essence of man and the temple within the human being. Man is alone there with God. He can hear His voice inside him. And now let's pray. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us for our sins. - Bernd. - Yes. You got mail for me? - Anything for me? - Wait. Unfortunately not. Sorry. But tomorrow, for sure. I hope so. You're making it dark in here. I can't read at night. God, Tommy, it's not like you're gonna read anything. You could get a lamp for that. I don't know, it's not good enough. Kevin, what do you think? He thinks it's good. - Man, you're cutting out all the light. - That's the whole point. What's wrong, Tommy? Are you afraid of the dark? Take one of your pills, man. Have you ever noticed what this place looks like? Looks like shit. Garbage there. Garbage there. Garbage there. There's trash over here. Fuck you. I have an idea. We can play the old cleaning game. Picco the housekeeper becomes a flying mop. Fuck you, I don't do shit. - I think the faggot should clean it. - Come on. I'll give you a blowjob. I don't like this plan, fuck off. Didn't I tell you not to talk back to me, man? Or should I clean it? I'm not gonna clean it, anyway. Yeah, Tommy, you're gonna clean it up today. No, man, look at me. I'm stoned out of my head. Makes no difference. You clean it today. No. You're gonna clean it up. I'm tired of cleaning it, okay? It's your turn. - Yeah! All good. - You spazz. Sit down. - Son of a bitch. - So Tommy's gonna clean it today. Then clean that up. Faggot. - Hey, Tommy, there's something here. - Sure, of course. Not "of course". Clean. - Change the last card for spades. - Damn. Here. I'll beat you one more time. One more time, come on. - Can I play, too? - No. - No one asked you. - Shut up. Come on, Thomas. Do some cleaning, it'll do your heart good. What's wrong with you? We don't want to play with you right now, that's all. Are you messing with me, man? Fuck off. What's wrong with you? - What's wrong with you, Thomas? - Shut up and piss off! Son of a bitch. - What? - What did he say? You want a card, Tommy? For example, you could have a five of diamonds. Or a joker. Or a jack. - Stop it. - Shut up, spazz. Great. Hey, Tommy, you want a smoke? What the hell was that? - Kevin, what's wrong with you today? - Nothing's wrong with me, man. - You watched too much Rocky again? - Shut up. You want some? But leave some for me, okay? This is my last weed. But leave some for me, okay? This is my last weed. I'm Thomas, the greatest faggot in the whole world. I want you to fuck me good. - I never talk like that. - What a spazz, this is unbelievable. I never talk like that. I'm just doing this. What are we going to do with you now? Thomas! You have mail. Really? Thank you. You don't have to thank me. - What's in there, Tommy? - Nothing. - A letter. - Stop it. - Give it to me. - Show it to me. We've been waiting too long. Guys, stop this. I'm not having fun. We're having fun, Tommy. Come on, Kevin, dude. Relax, we're just having some fun. Hey, don't be so fresh. Hold him down. Give me the letter! Marc, don't be shitty. Don't do it! Don't do it! Stop Marc, no! Marc, no. Cut it out, man. Stop it. Please. Stop it. Please, Marc, Marc. Loser. What are you doing there, Tommy? Bored out of fear again? Come on, guys. - Give me. - Hey, watch out, man. Give me back my pills. Give me my pills. What do you want, pal? What's your problem? It's your problem, Tommy. Come on, I need them. So, what now? Are you going to die now? Everything okay, Tommy? Freak. What was wrong with you yesterday? What was wrong yesterday? Kevin, fuck off. Come on, Tommy. I thought you were trustworthy, but you're as bad as everyone else here. What do you mean, now? You were just having a little fun. . . . - Hey! Tommy, stop it, okay? - Fuck you, you faggot. Liar. You're the lying traitor here. - What's wrong with Thomas? - He's not well today. Seriously? - Have a good weekend, guys. - Yeah, you too, buddy. Spazz. - What are you doing there? - Nothing, man. - Your parents? - Leave it alone. - Tommy, you were an ugly kid. - You're still an ugly kid. This is for your mom and dad. You got something to tell me? You want to say something to me? A letter from your beloved mother. And this is from your little sister. Stop crying, Tommy. Boeing 747. Tommy Airlines. Sissy, shut up. Are you a baby? If you hit the alarm, we'll destroy you, you can be sure of that. Enough, shut up. You're annoying me! - Now it's your turn. - He's quiet now. Still getting on my nerves, coward. - What's going on? - Keep quiet, fucker. I'm sorry, I accidentally touched it. - Everything all right? - Yes, I'm sorry. - Don't let it happen again. - No, it won't happen again. Good night. - Good night. - Come on, get him on the bed. - Come on, you spazz. Ready? Pull down his pants. You like that, don't you, faggot? You like that? Yeah! You like that. Shut up, coward. You'll get used to it. Please don't. Then hang yourself, asshole. I'm definitely not gonna stop you. Have you seen how someone hangs himself? No. You? Of course not, dickhead. Tonight we'll see if it's a first. No, no. Kevin, come help. Fucking pig. Gonna hang yourself now? Your bad luck. - Pro: More room. - Pro: More personal space. Con: We can buy more with four people. Shit. - Pro: A person is dying. - Isn't that actually a con? Yeah, depending on your point of view. Pro: Less crying. You made a good point. Pro: He'll be free of his own misery. He just woke up. Maybe he wants to join in. After all, we have a democracy. - It's just a con. - Con: We can get caught. - Then we're in shit. - You're right. Con: Bad grass supply. Why do you always say con, spazz? Are you a victim? I'm just saying what I think, man. You're being ridiculous, dude. Now give me the list. Cons, more, but this is qualitative. So I'm . . . gonna say . . . . . . pros won. - All right. - It's too short, man. This will work, my friend. - It's too short, you're not . . . - Do you have a better idea? The bed sheets. You tie them together and make them into a rope. - You do it yourself, man. - Just do it. I'll take care of our friend here. Come on, hurry up, Kevin. Come on, please. Please don't. Look at this. Look at this. Come on, now. Don't be a pussy, do it. What is the problem? Others had to do it. Now it's your turn. Guys, can you help me? Tommy. Tommy. You understand that this is for your own good, don't you? If you don't do it, you don't even want to imagine how bad it will be when we do it. - Come on, now. - Do it now. - Are you a coward, or do you dare? - Do it. Do it. Do it. You fucking coward. Fucking pussy. He's a victim. I'm gonna throw up now. Dear Mother, Dear Father, everything is so bad, it's just . . . - . . . I can't take any more. - No, that's not good. He must say he's hurting himself. It'll explain these wounds. - This is bullshit. - What nonsense? Do you have a better idea? Write down that your cellmates are constantly beating you and tormenting you. It couldn't be more obvious. No, he should say he can't take it anymore. This is a complete cliché. Cliché? I'll show you a cliché. I think there must be some fantasy in it. Maybe a little poetry. Poetry? Are you a fag, man? So give it to me now. That's not convincing. This is never gonna work. I'll write a suicide note, myself. Kevin, help me. Hold his arm tight. A scratch. Masochist. Suicide. Masochist! You gonna do it now? Tommy, man. It's not that bad. You've tried it before. Do it now, you asshole. Come on, man. That's enough. That's enough? You son of a bitch. - Are you a junkie or something? - Your objections get on my nerves. I just mentioned it. What do you mean, "I just mentioned it"? Now you're screwing with me? - No, man. - Hang yourself. - No. - You like that? No problem. Wow, you're disgusting, Tommy. Very disgusting. You gonna do it now? Will you do it? You can make a choice. Knife or rope. Please, I won't say anything. Please, please. . . . I swear I won't rat. Bullshit! You don't give up. You dirty pig. God. You spazz. What a terrible idea, look at him. Hey, calm down. I won't calm down. Look at him. He's got fresh wounds on his head. It doesn't look like a suicide anymore. We'll never get away with this. As long as he hangs himself, everything will be okay. Then how . . . . . . are we responsible for the injuries. And it makes no difference. It doesn't make any difference? Stop thinking about the outside world now. Tell me, how stupid are you? You're here in juvie, man. No pig out there is your . . . . . . friend, the drugs, the murder . . . . . . they're not interested in you. You're finished. We're all finished, man. There is no outside for us. Not for you, either. Get it through there now, stupid picco. So it doesn't matter what shit we do here. We have nothing to lose. I'm getting bored. Kevin. Kevin, do it now. Let's go. Hey Tommy. I'm sorry, but we need to get this over with. There's no turning back now. It's gonna be real quick. It's not gonna hurt, man. Believe me. Now, if you say no, all this nonsense will continue. Take the rope. That's better, okay? Okay? Come on, now. The knot will hold, don't worry. Do it now. It goes around your head. Very simple. Around your head. Look, it's happening. Tighten the noose. Tighter. That's good. And now jump off. Come on, do it now, Tommy. It'll soon be over. Come on, son, please, please get this done, I can't stand watching anymore. I can't. I can't do it. - Shit. - Fuck. - If this doesn't work. - What now? We have to do it ourselves. You do it. Of course. Fuck it. I can be anything, but definitely . . . . . . not a murderer. You do it. Forget it, I won't do that under any circumstances. You have to do it.l Because you're too much of a coward to end this? You started this nonsense. You've never been involved all this time. What bullshit, man! You should do it now because you're not involved. It seems so. Shit, Picco. What kind of coward are you? I'm slowly starting to think we're picking the wrong guy. You're the biggest sissy. You know what the difference between you and Tommy is? Do you know? At least he has the courage to do something. Please don't ask me. I can't do this. You forget you still have to prove yourself here. You certainly haven't shown any courage until now. - You need to earn respect. - Nonsense. - You're the new picco. - Don't call me that. I'm not the picco. You are the piccos. You really are fucking cowards. You'll do it now. There's no way out of this, Kevin. Fuck. Just do it. I can't. Look into my eyes. Look at me. You asshole. Then you can. Listen to the faggot and finish it. Fuck you! Damn it, Picco. It's him or you. Sorry. You would have done the same. Stop it. Stop it. Day 104 Aah! Children. What now? Guys, what is it? I'm sorry, but there's a dead man in the toilet. What? There's a dead man in the toilet. You're not serious, are you? Please come. I want two paramedics in the second block immediately. Good god, didn't you see or hear anything? No, Mr. Ortmann. We were sleeping. There will be an investigation. And questions. You will be held responsible if you are involved. All of you. We shouldn't open our mouths. Nobody should find out. Absolutely. He didn't notice? We have to deal with this . . . together. We have no choice. He was going to hang himself. Sooner or later. He'd tried it before. He was a coward, you know that. - They'll find all his wounds. - That's bullshit. We can't get away with this. Let's be clear about something. I'll bet we'll be charged with assault . . . but not murder. Everyone is responsible.
