-Are you okay? Do you need anything? -Heather, I told you tonight you’re not my assistant. You’re my friend, celebrating the best birthday. Of my life with me! -Katie. -Ohh. -Let’s do it, let’s do it. -Jamie. - Okay, okay. - Okay, ready? Ready, ready, ready. -Okay. So that disco ball, amazing. -Oh, Snoop insisted on having one for his record release. -Snoop Dogg. -Heather! The birthday girl needs a drink. -No, I don’t. I want to remember tonight. Have any of you seen Connie? -Mnh-mnh. Okay, but listen, I really want to pick your brain. So I have an audition coming up, and it’s to play a drug addict. -Jamie. -What? Too soon? -Yeah. -It has only been three months since she got out of rehab. I wasn’t sure if I should invite her to this. -She’s her sister. Of course you should invite her. -Cake time. Where’s your lesser half? -You never liked any of my boyfriends. -Yeah. - Let’s go find him. - Alright. -Yeah. -Connie? No. No. -I didn’t... I didn’t know he was your boyfriend. -I introduced you to him three hours ago as my boyfriend! You seriously need help! -You need to pick better boyfriends. Hand me my keys. - No. You’re wasted. I’ll call you a car. - I said give them to me. - No! Connie... stop it. Connie! Let... go! Katie, get up. Come on. -Just get out! You’re fine. Get up! I didn’t shove you that hard. Get up. Get up. Get u... -You okay? -Yeah, just a bad dream. - Well, we’re almost here. - Really? -Um, Amanda’s been taking photos of you drooling in your sleep. I tried to stop her. -It’s for the wedding app! Everybody likes candid shots. Trust me. - You’re mean. - Sorry. I’m just doing my official duties as maid of honor. Anton, how are your two duties coming along? -Don’t worry about me, okay? Bachelor party and don’t lose the rings. -It’s beautiful. -What a day to land. -Gorgeous sky. -What a pretty city. -Right over here is Bathhouse Row, where you can soak in the historical thermal hot springs. -That’s why they call it Spa City. - I want to do that. - I know you do, and you will. We’re gonna do all the touristy things, including a nature hike at... -Garvan Woodland Gardens? -That’s the place. -You did your homework. I’m impressed. -Perks of having an event coordinator as your best friend. -Somebody remind me why we’re staying at Tom’s mom’s house tonight. -Because it would be rude if we didn’t stay one night. - Just one night. - But tomorrow night, we’re at the hotel downtown, where all the action is. -Oh, remember, we are not telling her we live together. Okay? Take a deep breath and just be yourself. Yeah. - Tom! -Ma! It’s so good to see you. -Oh, baby! Oh! You’re too thin. Have you eaten? -Yes. I’m fine. Katie, this is my mother. -Mrs. Lin, I’ve heard so much about you. It’s so great to meet you. -I wish I could say the same. Tom, you have stayed away for far too long. Oh. You speak Korean? - I greet Korean. - Oh. -I know Tom was raised in Beijing. But you’re from Seoul, right? - Yes. -That’s Amanda, and this is Anton. Anton’s my best friend. -Hey, Mama Lin. Nice to meet you. -Well, I could eat. -We’ll have tea first. Please come in. -Oh, wow. I love the minimalistic design. Mix the natural wood and the rock. I’m an interior designer and... - Um, Katie? -Oh, forgive me. Tom told me. I-I knew I’d forget because of the excitement. -So that’s why I thought Amanda would be the best person to throw Anton and I’s premiere party. -So, Mrs. Lin, you got to tell me, when he was a kid, did you think he’d grow up to be such a big hot-shot film producer? -I am very proud. I just wish he could be closer to his family. -I do too, Mom. But aren’t you happy we’re having the wedding here? -Of course. It’s all just happening so fast. So how did you two meet? -Through Amanda. Amanda and Tom were college buddies. -Excellent. Education is very important. -I agree. -And so is family. Do you want children? -Oh, well, if the timing is right and everything, then I would be open to the idea. But we just both work so much. -Yeah. -But the clock is ticking, dear. -Women are having babies at all sorts of ages now. - Of course. That’s right. - Mm-hmm. -Dinner was delicious. -Oh. You hardly ate, dear. What do you like to cook, Katie? -I make a fantastic box mac and cheese. Honestly, I mainly order in. I mean, who wants to mess up the kitchen when you can have gourmet food delivered to your door in 30 minutes, right? -Maybe. I was thinking, you know, you could teach her some of grandma’s recipes. -Yes, maybe. I certainly don’t want my son to go without a home-cooked meal for the rest of his life. -Well, why don’t I help you with these dishes? - Yeah. - Oh, I can help you. -No. You guys get the bags and settle in. -Yeah. -See you in a second. She hates me. I couldn’t have bombed harder if I tried. -No, she didn’t. She was just... Just took some time for her to, you know, warm up to you, that’s all. -She seemed to like Amanda just fine. -Amanda isn’t taking away her only son. And we’re getting married next week, so... -I know, but I work a lot. And I’m not the stereotypical, old-school housewife that she wants me to be and... No, no, no, Tom, we shouldn’t. -Okay. You’re right. You’re right. -We have separate bedrooms already. I seriously do not need another reason for your mom to disapprove of me. -Okay. You’re right. You’re right. Is this how it’s gonna be for the rest of our lives? No. You’re just always right and I’m always wrong. -Yep. So why don’t you just accept your fate? Oh. -Hello? Hello? Listen, if you have something to say, just say it. Otherwise, stop calling me. -You don’t need to do this. Go rest. You must be tired from traveling. -I want to help. Katie really is a great girl. You’ll see. And with everything she’s been through with her family, she just wants so much to be a part of yours. And there was a lot of pressure on her today. -I’m sure losing both parents at such a young age was very difficult. -Yeah, and her sister, Connie... -Connie? -Oh. Tom didn’t tell you about her? -Tom tells me so little about his life these days. I should know what he’s marrying into. Please. -Um, yeah. Connie just has a few issues. -Issues with what? -She’s struggled with drugs and alcohol... for years and, um... when she’s abusing, she can get a little... -Violent? -No, no, no, no. What I mean is, it’s been tough for Katie and Katie meeting Tom... He’s so wonderful and they’re happy and this is good. This is good for them. -Good night. -Good night. -You okay? -You don’t, like, have a crazy ex-girlfriend, do you? -Well, um... well, there’s that one girl that poisoned all the bunnies. But other than her, no. Why? Happier times, huh? I was thinking about my dad today. It doesn’t seem fair, does it? No, it doesn’t. -Are you upset that Connie’s not gonna be here? -Well, she’s in rehab, so she can’t be here. -That’s not what I asked. Are you upset? -I’m still so angry with her. -Yeah, I’m sure you are. But she is your sister. -If she were here, it would turn into the Connie Show and all the drama that surrounds her. So it’s for the best. -I know this... Your mom and dad are so proud of you and the woman you’ve become. And they’ll be watching with my dad. Front-row seats. -I love you. -I love you, too. - Well, here we go. - You’re gonna love this place. -Oh, my gosh. You see that? Right there is where I was all the time I was a kid. I was always sitting right there. -Ah. You must be our wedding party. Welcome to the Arlington. -Yes. McPherson and Lin. -She’s got it. -Oh! You made it. Oh, my God. Oh, welcome to the madness. -I can’t believe you’re getting married. - I know. - Okay. And before moi? That is what I really can’t believe. -All right, guys, go do guy things. -Cool. We’ll see you at the venue? - Yes. - Hey, Amanda. -Hey, Heather. Can you order us room service up to Katie’s suite? Maybe some, like, coffee and pastries or something? -I am off the clock, but, sure. -Thanks. - Surprise. - What? What are you... I thought that you were... -I got released early. It was a mistake coming here. I, um... -Of course not. I want you to be here. -I’m so sorry, Katie. I... -Shh. Uh... come here. -I’m better now. I promise. -Amanda introduced us. I owe it all to her. -Well, Tom is incredible... and you are incredible. I knew you guys would hit it off. -You deserve this, Katie. I’m really happy for you. -Thanks. -What is it? Okay. Did everybody get an e-mail with the itinerary? - Yes. - Can you text me? -We’re getting our dress fitting at Something Blue. And then, Katie, we’re meeting Tom at the wedding venue. -I-I can just meet you all later on after the bridal stuff. -No. You should come. - Really? - Yeah. I want you to be there. -Okay. I’d love that. -Great. Um, why don’t you meet us in the lobby in a bit? I’ll text you all the info. Let me see your phone. What’s your passcode? -1, 2, 3, 4. -Okay. I just put my contact info in, so just shoot me a text with yours. -Okay. See you later. -Bye. -Are you okay? -I just wasn’t expecting this. -Well, she got released from rehab, so I’m guessing she’s sober. -Take a look at what this letter says. -"You’re making a big mistake. Call off the wedding or you’ll regret it the rest of your life." Did she write this? - Who knows? - Maybe this isn’t a good idea. -Well, now that she’s here, I can’t not have Connie be one of my bridesmaids. -Okay, we’re gonna need to call the shop and make sure they have a dress in her size. -I can call. -Thanks. Unbelievable. -Room service. You’re perfect. -I hate you. -Step up here. -Has she texted you? -It’s fine. Just be here with us. -I love the beading. -How do you feel? How do you feel? - Like a princess. - Oh. -I am so sorry. I waited for you guys, but you didn’t show up. What happened? - I don’t know. What happened? -You text me to meet you in the hotel lobby at 3:00. -I told you 2:00, and then I texted you to be here. - That’s not true. - Let’s use our inside voices. -You know what? It’s fine. It’s probably just a misunderstanding. Connie, please. I don’t want everybody fighting on a day that’s supposed to be special for me. -You’re right. -And I needed you to be on time today so that I could ask... -I think this is for you. -Oh, can you just leave that in the dressing room, please? - Of course. - Thank you. -That was for me? -But if it’s gonna be like this, I don’t... -No, no. It means so much to me that you want me in the wedding. -Well, then let’s get you fitted. - For the sweat. - Hmm. Thanks. -Can’t wait to go inside. -I can’t believe we got this reservation. It’s the best place in town. -Hi. You must be Connie. I’m Tom. - Hi. It’s nice to meet you, Tom. - Nice to meet you. Wow. This is where it’s all gonna happen. - Yeah. - Wow. Shall we? - Yes. -Amanda? - I... - What’s going on? -I don’t know. I don’t know. This is a disaster. -I know, but I got to go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Y’all don’t need to be in here. - What happened? - We were vandalized last night. -But we’re getting married here in a week. -Yeah, that’s not gonna happen. We’re gonna have to cancel all our upcoming events, obviously. -Canceling? No. How are we supposed to find another venue within the next week? -I mean, I think you can just get this place cleaned up and ready. -And I think you don’t know much about construction, so... -I just need to get some air. -I got to take this. Yeah, yeah. Hold on for a second. If you want to come with me to the office, we can pull up your reservation. No, I know. No, it has to be here today. Have you seen this place? -Do you think it’s a bad sign or omen or something? -Nope, I don’t. -I just feel like... -What? -I don’t know. Maybe your mom was right. This is all happening just... -My mom also likes pineapple on pizza, and... I don’t care. Hey. I don’t want to wait another minute to start the rest of our lives together. -Ma’am, like I said, there’s just not much I can do. -Yes, there is. You know what? If the work can’t be done in time for my little sister’s wedding, then it’s clearly your responsibility to find us another venue. -Okay, I think we’re done here. -I don’t think we are. - Get your hands off me. - Connie, stop! -I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. - What’s going on? -Look, you all need to leave, or I’m gonna call the police, okay? This lady is out of control. They’ve already been here once today. I got no problem with them coming back. - Alright. Come on. - Please. It was a tough day. -Katie, um... I did give Connie the wrong time. - What? - I know. I’m so sorry. I don’t know how I got this wrong. I don’t get things wrong. I didn’t want to tell you because you trusted me with your wedding, and I just... I messed it up, and you know how organized I am. Okay, Connie comes in. You want her to be a bridesmaid. It just... It threw a wrench into everything. -Amanda. -And to be honest, I don’t like her. She is selfish and emotionally stunted, and she’s never done anything but hurt you. Well, no wonder she was so angry. -And I get it. Like, I get the bridal shop. But things escalated fast at the venue. Like, if you didn’t walk in, like, would it have gone further? -I don’t know, but it feels like everyone is trying to make everything so perfect that it’s just ruining everything. -Yeah. No, you’re right. We just need to take a deep breath, relax. By we, I mean me. This is supposed to be fun. -Please. - Connie. - Hey. What are you doing here? -Oh, I’m staying here with the bridal party because I’m the groom. -Right. Of course. It’s a virgin daiquiri. I don’t know what got into me today. -We don’t have to talk. -Being here, seeing Katie, the way she looks at me. Disappointment all over her face. I wanted to stand up for her to fix it. And when I couldn’t, I just lost control for a second. -It’s understandable. -No, because, see, I thought I had my anger in check. -Well, no one’s here to judge you, especially not Katie. So cut yourself some slack. And enjoy that virgin daiquiri of yours. -Thank you. -We’re gonna be family soon. -I look forward to it. -Are you okay? I heard about what happened with Connie. -Yeah. Typical. The whole day ended up being about her. -Maybe she’s just jealous. I mean, look at your life. You’ve got it all. - Stop. No. - Deep down, maybe she just wants to see you fail. -I don’t know. I mean, she’s definitely struggling, but... I think she wants me to be happy. -I know I’m just your assistant. - Heather. You’re not just my... - I care about you. I just don’t want to see you get hurt again. -Believe me. Neither do I. -Katie, can we talk? -I’m gonna go. -What’s the saying, wrong foot? -It’s just that this is what I was afraid of. Nothing has really changed. -That’s... That’s not true, Katie. Rehab was different for me this time. I’ve worked really hard these past few months, and Amanda gave me the wrong time. -Yeah. She told me. -She did? -Yeah, but that doesn’t explain what happened at the venue. -I know, but... I-I just wanted to help you. -I don’t need your help, Connie. We got this. We did it all without you because you weren’t around. -You’re right. I’m sorry. -Can we just put this behind us? -Of course. -See you tomorrow? -Okay. -I love you. -I love you more. -Bob, so good to see you. -Good to see you, cuz. -Good to see you. Hey, man. -Hey. Oh, Jon, Su, this is Katie. -We’re not that old school. - Well, I can’t keep up. - Oh, how you doing? -Listen, I’m gonna stay here. I don’t want there to be any reason for this day to get messed up. -You’re not gonna mess anything up. -Plus, you’re already paid for. -Just get in the van. -Truce? -Of course. -Gosh, it’s like wrangling cats. -I read they planted to 155,000 blooms. -Heather, can you get a pic of all of us? -Yes, ma’am. -Come on, let’s get a picture. Alright. Got it. -Hey. Everything okay with you guys? -Yeah. It’s just... I get that it’s her job to boss me around at work, but I’m one of her bridesmaids. Why does she keep barking orders at me? -I don’t think she means it like that. I think it’s just hard to switch it back and forth, you know? Like, where do you draw the line? So from 9:00 to 5:00, you’re her assistant. But then 5:00 on, you’re her friend or 10 to 6:00? - Right. -Oops. I just got a work e-mail, and we’re having dinner as friends. Can you be my assistant for a second? -Yeah. -Oh, she’s going into a meeting and she has something in her teeth. And I mean, you tell her, are you being a friend or an assistant? -Jamie, I get it. -Just talk to her. Katie is one of the easiest people to talk to. -Yeah. I know. I will. - This place is incredible. - Isn’t it? Being in Los Angeles, you forget that nature feels good. -Yeah, you do. -Tom appears to be getting pretty chummy with Connie. That’s strange. -Tom is just like that. He wants everyone to feel included. -Yeah. I don’t mean to open up old wounds, but he knows your history with her. -Okay, that’s all we’re gonna say about that. -I just feel like he’d be more conscious of it, you know? -He’s never done anything to make me question him. I trust him. - I’m good. - Okay. -Amanda, dear, come sit next to me. -Oh. Perfect. I put myself next to you anyway. Great minds think alike. -Tom tells me that you set up quite the excursions for everyone. -Oh, yes! Your city is incredible. We went to Garvan Woodland Gardens, and it is so breathtaking. Have you seen the tulips in bloom? -I have, dear. So, what is on the menu for tonight? -Oh. Three cup chicken is our main dish. Oh. I make it at home. The best. Right, Tom? - What’s that? - My three cup chicken. -Yes! Oh, I love it. I could have it every day. -It’s a shame that Katie doesn’t cook. -I’m right here. -Do you remember that time you cooked for your dad on Father’s Day? -The grilled cheese? -Not just any grilled cheese. This thing was huge. I mean, I think you used, like, 20 slices of American cheese and a whole loaf of bread, just one stacked on top of the other. -Grilled cheese? How complex. -Really? -That’s actually really sweet that, you know, you wanted to do something special for your dad, and that’s what counts. And I love grilled cheese, too. Maybe not the size of a small child. -Connie, how’s the venue hunting coming along? -I’m working on it. -I’m sorry. I don’t understand. -Why was she put in charge of that? -What’s going on here? -Oh, Mrs. Lin, it’s okay. It’s just that the venue we originally had got vandalized, but... -So you don’t have a wedding venue? -No. -Well... perhaps we should postpone the wedding for now... take a little time to rethink a few things. -So, Mrs. Lin, is it? You know, people who are so critical of others are usually just lonely and pathetic. -Connie. -That’s interesting coming from you. -Ma. -What’s that supposed to mean exactly? -How was the rehab, dear? -You know what? I’m... Just... Just... -I’m sorry. My mom was out of line. -Was she? I... I don’t even know why I was saying what I was saying. -No. No, no. You were protecting your sister, my mom was protecting me, and things just went a little too far. -No. No, it’s not that. I... I feel a little weird, almost... almost high, and I don’t understand. ’cause I’ve been drinking iced tea all night. I don’t... I don’t feel in control of my emotions or my body. -There’s a lot going on. It’s a wedding. People’s emotions are heightened. Or maybe you’re just not used to feeling things sober. -Are you a drug counselor? -No. Nothing that noble. I’m just a producer. We all want you here, Connie. But if being here isn’t good for your sobriety, then you should do what’s right for you, not Katie. I just... don’t want your decision to affect my fiancée’s happiness. -Of course. Thank you. -And she was wasted. -You don’t know that. I get it. You don’t like her, and I understand why. But you really have to stop. -Katie, she was slurring her words, and she fell down. -She wasn’t drinking. I saw her. -Is she on something else? -I don’t feel right about that. -I do. -Hey. I didn’t want to upset you or make something out of nothing, but... given her history and what just happened... you should see this. - That looks intimate. - When was that taken? -The first night at the hotel. And where are the two of them now? -I-I-I don’t... I don’t know. I... I’m sick. -K-Katie? Um, hey, hey, let’s talk about it. What’s going on? -Maybe you should find Connie and talk to her. -What? -Maybe you can explain to me why you were seen hugging her at a bar the other night. -Are you... Are you kidding me? I was trying to h-help. I was talking her off a ledge. You know, doing what any good brother-in-law should do. I was just... I was just trying to help. Just for you. -You know what happened between her and my ex. -Yes, I do. And I’m not your ex. Okay? You’re okay. And it seems like she’s really trying, so.. -Really? They found a bottle of pills in her purse, Tom. - Okay. - She’s not trying. She’s back on drugs. -Well, have you talked to her about it? Just... talk to her. She’s your sister. She’s the only family you have. Maybe try to be more patient, more understanding. You know? All those things I love about you. -I have been patient and kind and understanding for the last 10 years, Tom. You should go before I say something I regret. -Katie, do... Hey. Don’t do this. -Just go. Why was he even touching her at all? That’s just so not okay. -I know it looks bad, but Connie could have hugged him and he didn’t know what to do. And if he did hug her first, people make mistakes, Katie. -Was it a mistake? -Maybe you’re being a little hard on him. - I’m not hard on Tom. - Well, do you trust him? -Of course I do. -You just kicked him out of your room. Katie, I think you might have some trust issues. -What do you mean? -Well, you don’t trust me either, to do my job correctly. -That’s not true. -Katie, you micromanage me all the time, which makes me feel like I can’t live up to your standards. It’s like you’re up here, and everyone else is down here. -Where is this even coming from? I would never, ever want to make you feel that way. -Well, you do. And, like, right now, I don’t know whether I’m saying this to you as your friend or as your assistant. -Why would you say anything at all? Heather, I don’t have anywhere to get married, which probably doesn’t matter because I’m thinking of calling the wedding off and losing the love of my life whose mom hates me and hates my drug-addicted sister even more, who’s here trying to rebuild our relationship while popping pills and starting fights and falling down. Do I not have enough going on for you? This just couldn’t have waited until we were back in L.A.? -Hey. I overreacted last night. Hard for me to not feel protective of you. You’re my little sister, and I don’t like how she treats you. And I know I haven’t been around, and it’s not my place... and she’s gonna be your mother-in-law. And... But I’ll try harder. I will. I have some good news. I have a venue. It’s at the hotel. They had a cancellation. It’s the ballroom, and it’s perfect. Everything’s gonna be okay. -Nothing is gonna be okay, Connie. -Yes, it is. -Why? Why can’t you stay away from my boyfriends? -What? -Why, Tom? -Katie. I’ve been horrible. I know. And I’m... I’m so sorry. But I-I would never do anything like that to you again. What are those? -I found them in your purse last night. -Those aren’t mine. -I gave you the benefit of the doubt. I gave you another chance, and you lied. -Those aren’t mine! They’re not! I’m clean. Katie, I promise. -Connie, stop. Just stop. I can’t listen to those same exact words come out of your mouth one more time. -Okay. -Are you positive that she’s the right girl for you? -Yes, I am. Katie is the love of my life, and you’re gonna accept it. -And why would she move in with you before your marriage? It’s not proper, and you lied to me about it. -How did you know that? -A mother knows these things. -She moved in with me because I asked her to. I didn’t tell you because I know you. I know you’ll think less of her for it, and that’s not fair, Mom. But you shouldn’t lie to your mom. I was wrong. Can I tell you something now? Katie is the most wonderful girl I’ve ever met in my life. And she loves me... with her whole heart. And somehow, every day, she inspires me to do the best I can. She takes care of me when I forget to take care of myself. And she’s quick to forgive and slow to judge. I just can’t imagine my life without her. -Then you should go and make things right. -Do you think I’m overreacting? You know Tom better than I do. Could he do something like this? -A week ago, I would have said no. Did you show him the picture? What did he say? -That he was just talking to her for me, which I don’t need him to do, by the way. I don’t understand why he’s defending her. Seriously. -Yeah. I don’t know. I don’t get that either. -And, of course, Connie showed up this morning. -With apology number... 2,367? And I’m sure she denied everything. -She’s just lied to me so many times that her words have lost all meaning. How do you have a relationship with someone like that? How do you emotionally invest? Everything was fine until she got here. -No, no, no. Don’t cry. Don’t. Hey, don’t make any rash decisions, okay? Here’s my suggestion. We show up at that club tonight... - No. - With smiles on our faces and we have a good time. -I don’t feel like it. -That’s just because you’re all up in your head. Okay? You need to just take a step back and just have fun. That’s what we were talking about, right? This is supposed to be fun. Where’s the fun Katie? Huh? -What is this? -Ready? Surprise! -You guys are gonna get me in so much trouble. -Oh, God. -Baby, this one’s for you. -Tom? -♪ ...just fine ♪ ♪ I was out on my own ♪ -What is happening? -♪ Then I opened my eyes ♪ ♪ And I put down my pride ♪ ♪ I was holding you closer than anybody else ♪ ♪ When the lights go out, it’s you, babe ♪ ♪ Every time I’m down ♪ -Yep, this is how it is. -♪ Every night in my sleep, I’m saying your name ♪ ♪ You know for me, it’s always gonna be you, babe ♪ -Hey. -Hey. How’d it go? -Oh, uh... I shouldn’t quit my day job, but she... she smiled. -Nice. - So these are her favorites? - Yep. -Okay. Thank you, Connie. -Good luck. -Hey, um, how are you holding up? Are you... Are you doing okay? -I’m fine. Go. Go. -Good evening, Miss McPherson. How can I help you? -Please listen carefully. I have apparently eaten some nuts, and I am definitely allergic. I’m about to go into anaphylactic shock. I have a pen with me, but please call an ambulance immediately, okay? -Okay. I’m going to hang up right now and call an ambulance. -Did you find it? -No. I know it was here. - Where? Where did you pack it? - In my suitcase. Are the paramedics here? -They’re on their way. I have this first-aid kit. -Does it have an Epipen? -I don’t know. What does it look like? Is this it? - Yes! -Okay. You remove the blue cap and then pull the release. -Hey. Hey. Baby, how you feeling? -Kinda like I got hit by a truck, but better. -You’re a very lucky girl. All of your vitals are looking good now. And your last respiratory test was normal. We’d like to keep you and monitor you for a little bit longer, but... we should have you out of here soon. - Thanks, Doc. - Thank you very much. -Oh, and stay away from those nuts. -Tom, you knew I was allergic. Why... -Katie... Connie picked up the chocolates for Tom. -But I don’t see a reason she would want to hurt you. Maybe the... Maybe the shop made a mistake. -How long were they sitting outside my door? Was Heather anywhere near them by chance? -Why? -We had a fight last night, and she didn’t show up to my bachelorette party. -Oh. No, no, I didn’t see her. -I’m so incredibly sorry for not trusting you and... if I hurt you or made you feel like I was pushing you away, I’m so sorry. -Hey, no need to apologize. -Well, I’ll leave you two alone. I’m gonna make some calls. I think we need to cancel the rehearsal dinner. - Yeah, probably best. - No, I’m not letting anything else get in the way of our wedding. -Babe, we could still have a wedding without a rehearsal dinner. Just... I want you to rest. -I feel fine. All of our guests are in town. And this is the last night before you’re my husband. I want to go, and I want to celebrate with you. -Okay. Good. ’Cause I still don’t know how to spell "fiancée." -Where were you last night? -I didn’t think you’d want me there. -Were you outside my room at any point? -No. Why are you asking me that? -Because someone left chocolates with nuts for me outside my door. -I know you’re allergic to nuts. Deathly allergic. We may have some issues we need to work through, but I am not trying to kill you. Seriously. Do you hear yourself? - Okay. - Come on. We got to go. -So what did you guys do last night? -Oh, I wouldn’t know. -It was so fun, but ask Tom. -Oh, you’re never gonna know. No way. -That way. -Katie. Katie, please. Listen to me. Something isn’t right. -I don’t want you here, Connie. -Those pills weren’t mine. I swear. And I triple-checked the chocolates to make sure there were no nuts. I didn’t do those things, but they happened. So someone did. -Things just always seem to happen when you’re around. -None of this adds up, and I’m worried. I’m worried someone’s trying to hurt you. -Okay, you know what? I’ll say it. Connie, you’re a drunk and a drug addict. And the reason you can’t remember any of these things is because you’ve spent half of your life blacked out. The only thing Katie needs protection from is you and the epic and unrelenting crap that surrounds you. -Katie... -If you love me and want to do something for me... Not you... then just go home. -Just watch your back, Katie. - Drinks? - Yes. -How you doing? So good to see you, man. We appreciate you coming. We’ll be right back. Enjoy. Have fun. Thank you. Thank you so much. -I’m so happy. -Hello! Thank you, everybody, so much for being here. I want to extend a very, very warm welcome to all of our out-of-towners. Welcome to beautiful Hot Springs. Fortunately, it is my job to make sure that all these precious moments are documented, which means photos and lots of them. Candid photos are best for those of us who may not have an artistic eye. But we will also get very cheesy, staged photographs from our lovely wedding photographer, Aaron. So, everyone, please, please get your picture taken tonight, and we will start with our lovely bride and groom. -Aw, Jamie. Thank you. -Oh, you’re welcome. -So right here? -Whoo. Beautiful. -Oh, thank you. It’s all her. I’m not... No one’s gonna be looking at me in this photo. - Aah! - Oh! Oh! Oh, oh, oh. - Katie! - Oh, no! -Tom! -She can’t swim! -Where is she? I don’t see her. -I can’t find her! -Look under the dock! - Katie! - What happened? -I think she hit her head. She may be unconscious. -Just pull her up. Come on. - Is she breathing? - Can you get her? - She’s not breathing. - Come on. - John, Sue, come help. - John, Sue, come grab her arms. And then I’ll grab her legs. Come on. -She’s not breathing. She’s unconscious. -Be careful with her. -Okay. Just pull her back. We got to set her down on the ground. Come on, lay her down right here. Lay her down right here. - She’s unconscious. She’s unconscious! - Okay, here. I’m doing CPR. Call 911, get an A.E.D. -Please, please let her be okay. Please let her be okay. Come on. - We’re at Fisherman’s Wharf, and our friend fell in the water and she’s not breathing. Please send someone now. - Oh, she’s not breathing. -It’s not working, Heather! Heather, it’s not working. Please, please, please, please let her be okay. -Yes! She’s okay! -What you did was unforgivable. -What are you talking about? -You loosened the railing. I almost drowned! - Katie, calm down. I don’t... -Why were you even there, Connie? Huh? How could you do this to me? - Do what? What happened? -I’m filing a police report, and they will catch you. -Police report? I... -She needs help, Katie. Just file the report. Seriously, it’s for the best. -It was obvious that you’d be taking pictures there. She knows you. She knows you can’t swim. -Hello. -But we can’t prove she did any of it. It’s all circumstantial. -Are you seriously defending her? -I’m not defend... -I don’t know why you would have her back right now. -I just don’t think we have enough evidence to have her charged with anything yet. -That’s it. The manager just verified that there were screws missing from the railing. -Can everyone just leave? I just... My head is spinning. I need some time alone. - Of course. - Try and get some sleep. -Heather. Thank you. And I’m sorry. -Of course. -You too. We’re not supposed to spend the night together before the wedding. It’s bad luck. -Sheriff’s Office. -Hello, I’d like to file a police report. -Can I get your name, please? -I promise you, there was no nuts in that chocolate. - Thanks. - You’re welcome. -I’ve tried everything. Maybe she’s right. Too many things have gone wrong. -You know, relationships need to be able to withstand this kind of thing. Do you think you all have what it takes for a lifetime together? -I don’t know. I don’t know. She just keeps pushing me away. -Maybe you just need to slow it down, call it off for now. Just give it some time. Tom, I’m so sorry. I hate this for you. -Do you remember the night I introduced you to Katie? -Yeah, of course. How could I forget that? -Well, there’s something about that night that you don’t know. -Okay. What is it? -I meant to set Katie up with Anton. Wait. What? Wh... Why? Why? -Because I thought you felt the same way I did. Don’t make me spell it out. I love you, Tom. I’ve loved you since college. Tom... I know this is sudden, but... you feel the same way, right? -No, Amanda... I don’t. I have to go. -Hi, Connie. Please come in. Have a seat. -I’d rather not. I know it was you. You... You destroyed the venue, you spiked my drink, you switched the chocolates, and you probably had something to do with the accident at the restaurant, didn’t you? Didn’t you?! -You’re such an easy target. Drug addict. You’re emotionally unstable. Your life’s in the gutter. -Stay away from my sister. Got that? -Or what? Are you gonna tell on me? I believe you’re the one who had sex with your sister’s boyfriend on her birthday while you were on drugs and drunk. Was it... Was it both? I can’t keep up, honestly. You are quite a piece of work. Look at you, Nancy Drew. -Mm-hmm. -Get... Get off! -Uhh! -What are you doing?! -Help me! Hello. There’s a woman here. She’s assaulting me. Hello. - That’s a lie! No! -Please help! -You’re sick. You really are. You’re crazy! - Hey. Hey. What’s going on here? - Just let me explain. -That’s... That’s her. She just attacked me. -No, I didn’t. You did that to yourself. Please, just listen to me. - What’s going on? -She just went crazy and was throwing glasses at the wall and breaking lamps, and she stabbed me. -Katie, she’s lying. -Somebody needs to call the police. She just filed a report against her. -Is this true? I’m gonna have to ask you to come with me. -No. No. You’re making a mistake. No. Katie! Katie, look at me! I have proof, a video on my phone! -Do you think I’m gonna need stitches or something? -Oh. -Hey! What’s going on out here?! -Let’s get you out of the hallway, and we’ll take a closer look. Okay? -I’m sorry. - 1114, yes? - Yes. -We’ll get you taken care of. -Thank you. Have a great day. -Thank you. -Hey, got your text. You should be getting your beauty rest. -I couldn’t sleep last night. -I’m really sorry. I know how badly you want her to be better. She’s, like, obviously getting worse. -Why do you have her phone? I saw it in your back pocket last night. -Because she threw it at me right after she started throwing glasses. -How’s your shoulder? -I’ll survive. -Well, I’m gonna go for a jog, blow off some steam. -Okay. - Bye. - Bye. -I told you... Katie? -You said you had proof. A video? I got your phone from Amanda. -She must have deleted it. I was there, Katie. She’s in love with Tom. I had a video of it. -Wait. Do your photos back up to your computer? -I don’t know. Maybe on my tablet. - Where is it? - In my room. -Okay. I need your password. -1, 2, 3, 4. -Seriously? And the... And the key to your room. -You know, I, um, I called you... so many times, but I hung up because I didn’t know what to say. I wasn’t sure you’d want to hear from me. -That was you? -I wanted to make sure you were okay, hear your voice. I missed you. -I missed you, too. There you are. - Oh. Hey. - Hey. We’re running really late. Come on. -I need to stop by the room real quick and take a shower. -We have showers in the suite. Yeah, but I need my stuff. -We have your stuff. Come on. everybody’s waiting. Come on. Okay, ladies, get ready for this beauty. -Oh. Wow. You look stunning. - Thank you. I love it. - You’re welcome. -Go put on your dress. Let’s hope it still fits. -I love you, Tom. I’ve loved you since college. -What are you doing in there? Do you need help? -Almost ready. Katie, you look incredible. -Thank you. Can someone zip me up? - Yeah. -You look absolutely breathtaking. -Thank you. -Why don’t you guys go check in on the groomsmen? Make sure they have their bow ties on straight. -Oh. - I forgot my purse. - Heather. I have a gift for Tom. I meant to give to Anton to give to Tom before the wedding. It’s a small engraving. Do you think you can bring it to him? -No problem. -It’s just inside my purse in the bathroom. -Is it wrapped in a box? I don’t see anything. Geez. It’s just inside my purse. -I’m not sure what it looks like. - Connie’s innocent. - What? -It was Amanda the whole time. Heather, I am so, so sorry for everything. How I talked to you, how we treated you. I need you to do something for me, as my friend. -Okay. -Get this to Connie at the police station. Um, it’s two blocks from here on Spring Street. I’ll explain everything later. Just don’t tell anybody where you’re going. - I’m afraid... - I’ll handle it. Okay? I’ll stall. Just please hurry. Yeah, just give it to Anton. He knows it’s a present for Tom. -Right. Anton. Got it. -It’s just this little metal card I had engraved for Tom to keep in his wallet. -With what? -Oh. A verse from a song. Well, our song. -That is so sweet. - Where is she? - She’s at the hotel with Amanda. It smells good. I have a surprise for you. Something borrowed. Hold still. Don’t make me stab you. -Stop! Amanda... I know it was you. -Katie, my gosh... It took you long enough. -I want you to get out. I don’t want you anywhere near this wedding. -There’s not gonna be a wedding, Katie. I tried to make it easy. -Amanda, open the door. Amanda! Let me out! Amanda! Amanda! Aah! Hotel phone. Hotel phone. Help! Somebody help me! Help! -Katie! Katie, we’re here! -Connie! Connie, help me! -Open the door. -I can’t. It’s locked! The whole room is on fire. The room is on fire! Hurry! I can’t breathe! -Katie, stand back! I’m gonna kick in the door! Connie, it’s moving closer. Hurry! Hurry, Connie! Aah! Connie, my dress is on fire! Somebody help! -Katie! Katie, come here! Come here! Come on! Crawl through! Give me your hand. Are you all right? - Yeah. -Katie! -Tom! -Are you okay? Over there, we’ll be safe. -I’m so sorry. I looked everywhere for you. I couldn’t find you. You okay? Hey. I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. I was looking everywhere for you. You okay? -Just happy to see you. Stop it. Get off me! -It wasn’t supposed to be this way. -You’ve never been a good friend. You always were a terrible, terrible friend. You don’t deserve him. You don’t deserve him. You don’t deserve him! -You okay? Tom. Tom. Tom, please. Please. No, no. No, this isn’t right. This isn’t right. This isn’t... -Katie. -Tom, I have to. How could you do this to me? I don’t understand. You were my best friend. -Really? Was I? You didn’t even notice that I was madly in love with Tom. -How could I possibly have known that you were in love with him? You never said a word about how you felt. -You should have noticed. He was all I talked about, Katie. -I thought you were buddies. He was more. He was the love of my life. He was all I had. And... And when he met you, I-I thought, "It’s okay. You know, it’s just a fling, and it’ll pass." And when it didn’t... I thought maybe I could stop the wedding. I just... I-I couldn’t stand the thought of you actually going through with it. -So you tried to kill me. -Things got out of control. -Out of control? I almost died. -I didn’t want to lose him. I couldn’t. -And now you’ve lost everything. I hope you get the help you need. I truly do. -Ma’am, you need to step away from the vehicle. -You look so beautiful. -It’s gorgeous. And I am incredibly honored to wear your wedding dress. -I hope it brings you and Tom good luck. -I’m sure it will. -I owe you an apology, Katie. I have been unkind. After my husband passed, Tom was all I had left. I just don’t want to lose him, too. -Mrs. Lin, I promise... you will never lose him. And I hope you feel that you’ve gained a daughter. -You ready? -I am. -See you out there. -Thank you for being here. -Well, if I’d known what it was gonna entail... - but I’m honored to be promoted. -I’m so proud of you. Even though I pushed you away, you didn’t leave. You stuck by me. You protected me. It was more than I deserved. -Don’t say that. You deserve everything. I’m just so sorry for every time I hurt you, every time I wasn’t there for you. -Remember when we were little girls and we used to dream about our weddings? The details changed over the years, like what our flowers would look like or what kind of dresses we would wear. But one thing remained the same. I would be right by your side, and you would be right by mine. I love you. -I love you more. -♪ You’re the love of my life, girl ♪ ♪ The reason I’m still alive, girl ♪ ♪ I’m gonna make you my wife ♪ ♪ Oh, you’re my everything ♪ -♪ Gonna give you my heart, boy ♪ ♪ Till the end of the world, boy ♪ ♪ I’ll never let you go ♪ ♪ Oh, you’re my everything ♪ -♪ You make everything better ♪ ♪ You’ve made my life a livin’ dream ♪ ♪ Life could not be sweeter ♪ ♪ You’re the only one for me ♪
