Whatever the one who's eating you? Man or wolf, All bellies look equal, One day earlier, one day later, there's hardly any difference. Jean de La Fontaine THE GOOD TIME GIRLS Directed by The most gorgeous nudes in Paris! The most gorgeous nudes in Paris! Goodnight, sir. Going home alone? Goodnight, sir. Looking for someone? The most gorgeous nudes in Paris! The most gorgeous nudes in Paris! The most gorgeous nudes in Paris! Oh, I'm sick! Need some help? Feel better, bastard? Disgusting! Come with me! - I must go. - Already? Stay a bit longer. No, I must go now, otherwise I'd be confined to barracks. - Aren't I worth it? - I have to go. See you. And now? Let's go to the Green Parrot! - I'd rather go home to bed. - How about Pigalle? - But where in Pigalle? - Let's go at once. - I'll get a taxi. - Get two! - I'm going home. - Me too, I'm fed up. - Why not come for the ride? - I'm fed up. Come on, let's go. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. The most gorgeous nudes in Paris! The most gorgeous nudes in Paris! They're nice but stupid. - Isn't that like ours? - No. The most gorgeous nudes in Paris! Good evening, young ladies. I'm Marcel and this is my friend, Albert. Albert, let me introduce... No? I'll try again. I'm Marcel and this is my friend, Albert. Albert, meet... Where are your manners? What's your name? Well, a little bird might tell me. Françoise? Sophie? Louise? Suzanne? Jeanne? I knew it: Albert, her name is Jeanne. Don't I get a reward, miss? Leave us alone! It did the trick. She answered! But go easy. And you, miss, what's your name? Ask your little bird! A true Parisian girl! Witty and everything. Please be polite. Be polite. May we see you back home? - You're doing it. - We don't mean any harm. Take the number of my car. My passport. Look, I'm a householder. Come on. Get in. Get in. What's the harm? We'll treat you to a nice dinner! Don't mess up now. Be polite. Then off to bed! - Is that you? - Yes, it's me. Don't judge by the face? How about it? - Hold on. - We're only with honourable intentions. - Think they'll buy it? - Sure, but go easy. - All right. We'll get in. - Bravo! Ladies... But we warn you we can quickly get out! No fear! Go on! Here we go! What is it? What? - Your car. - Where are we going? Don't worry about it. And now young ladies, a riddle to break the ice. I never say dirty things in front of young ladies, oh no! We are gentlemen. *** French charade: untranslatable *** *** My first is a bird. *** *** My second is what Dumas' son says *** *** to his domestics so they watch the clock through a keyhole.*** *** And the whole *** *** is an exclamation made by one who lost an object of value*** *** in a city of Eure-et-Loir.*** Don't you find? *** It's: "J'ai perdu ma montre à Nogent-le-Rotrou" *** Explain! *** My first, a bird: "Geai". *** *** My second, Dumas' son who talks with his father.*** *** It's: *** *** "Père Dumas montre à nos gens l'heure au trou." *** "L'heure au trou!" You there, what's your name? Jacqueline. Jacqueline. What's the difference between a frying pan and a chamber pot? Don't know? Then, I would hate to eat at your place! That kills me. That must be warm. Give me another one. My name isn't Jeanne. - It's Jane. - Oh, yes, Jeanne. Not J.E.A.N.N.E., but Jane, J.A.N.E. Why? I don't know. Ask my mother. I hate seeing it written as Jeanne. OK, darling! Then I'll watch my spelling when I write to you. Listen... You do make me laugh, Mr Marcel. Mr Marcel is so funny. Why Mr Marcel? Call me just Marcel! You don't mind? No, not at all. No need for formality! Should we tell all Jacqueline? If the mood takes you. OK, it's a deal. Now, we're all good friends. All this Baroness So-and-So and Duchess So-and-So stuff... turns me off. So it's Albert and Jacqueline. Marcel and Jane. Let's drink to that! Party time! To our smart little Parisians!! To the eternal feminine! You. Come on Jane, drink up! Hey, don't go too far. No more after this. So you say. You you. There we go. You see... Excuse me. I have to go somewhere. Where's the ladies' room? At the back and to the right. All this drink! It has to go somewhere. That's life. Now the Farondale! Stand up for the Farondale. Move on! You're sleeping. Stop... Stop! Finished. Thank you. Sit down, please. And now anatomically daring as ever... that bewitching... teasing threat... to domestic bliss... Here is... Dolly Bell!! Stop that! Damn it! Don't be like that! - You're a pain! - I got carried away. - Don't do it again! - Drink and make up! Take it easy, will you? - That does it! - I didn't mean to. - What do you take me for? - It slipped out. Let's go, Jacqueline. This guy makes me sick. It's a respectable man, but this night, he's only kidding. Hands off, then! - Friends again? - All right. If you behave. Here's a big kiss. And another one. See that? What? The guy with the motorbike. Waiter! Oh, look at that. Waiter! Charge all this to me. Drop me off here. - Don't be silly. - You'll get picked up. - Yes, you will. - No I won't, I live across the street. I'm tired. Goodbye. See you tomorrow, Jane. - 'Til tomorrow. - Goodnight gentlemen. - A bit stuck-up, isn't she? - She's waiting for a true love. Where are we going? - Albert's place. - I don't want to. - Just for some champagne. - Come on. You'll upset Albert. - I don't care about it. - Be nice. Get out. I can do it myself. - Stop it! - What? One of you is enough. - Can he leave us alone? - Let him be. He's harmless. What do you want, both of you? - At the moment, I can't. - I don't mind. What are you doing, silly girl? - Leave me alone! - Come on, please. Let's take a bath. Go easy, Marcel. Easy. Up already? It's half past seven. We're late. I'll make coffee. Did you sleep here? Yes. If anyone asks, tell them I did. Hurry up, Ginette. We'll be late. - You have a strange look on your face. - I'm tired. Let's go. Quick. Doing good, Madam Louise? - Good morning ladies. - Good morning. - Is he in a good mood? - I don't know. I just got here. You're late on your first day!? - Is Mr... - Take off your coat. Come with me, please, miss. Take off your coat, young lady. Come on, let's go. Sit down, please. It's five past nine, miss - I was just about to tell you... - Say no more. At my age, I take pleasure in reprimanding little girls. You arrive late on the first day in my employment. But I won't insist. Other less audacious girls, less modern miss, no doubt... might have been troubled at being even a minute late. As for you... as I said, I won't insist. However... If I note the time... it is because it marks your entry into life, my child. You work now. You can only depend yourself. You are now a woman... and a charming one. Let me congratulate you and present you this flower. The flower you once threw me... Are you ambitious, my dear? Yes. Is it your dearest wish to succeed? Oh, yes. I'm glad to hear it. Then, I'll tell you our terms of employment. Any items broken... light bulbs, sockets, fluorescent tubes, or whatever... will be replaced at your expense. I permit no exception. You must show deference to Madam Louise, the cashier. In your dealings with sales representatives and delivery men... you will be courteous, but distant, distant, my dear child. As to domestic appliances... vacuum cleaners, refrigerator, hot plates... all types of record player, etc... an inventory must be taken each evening before closing. There's nobody here today. Maybe the works out there. Oh please, Ma'am Louise... Show it to us. What? You know it well. This mysterious thing you have in your bag. Oh yes, Madam Louise, please! It's a secret of my own. I'll show it to you one of these days. What time is it? It's ten to eleven. Well... Five more like these, and our day is done. Some are crazy. Listen! We are two young women, and a young man follow us for some days. It's a biker and he remains silent. We would like to know which one he chose. Signed: languid ewe. Good morning madam! Good morning, young ladies! Good morning. I've finished, young ladies. It's written! Bravo! Read it to us. I wrote two poems. The first one is titled: "Priam's Prayer" And the second one: "Sonnet to Saint Peter" - I'm looking forward to it. - Please, put some organ music on. What? A battery, please. Rita, bring a battery, will you? 90 F. Thank you, sir. - Do you have my money? - No! I'm finished. I've had enough of losing all my savings. I'm begging you. Give me my 100 bucks. I don't have any money left this month. We're waiting the poem! You're right. Put that music on again. When Saint Peter, - standing... - Shh, not too loud, Louis! When Saint Peter, standing at his cloudy threshold, looks down upon our mud, deep in the hole. Would I ask you, Apostle, to which saint I will give my heart. And for you, soul saviour, would I know how to praise you? But... When you are the torch of your god, I proclaim for mine, deep in my grave, I scream with only one word, facing some hostile mud... What's that mess? My child, all is one, One is all... Let it be! Is that the way you work? Hurry up! He may come back. Give me 10 bucks, that'll be OK. - Hello ladies. - Hello "Teddy Bear". I'll deliver your order this afternoon. - Without fail? - Without fail. Well, see you later. Hey, "Teddy Bear"! - What? - Come here! - I swear it's not that. - Like hell! I need to work. Not your work that brings you here twice a day? - Don't tease him, Rita. - He's a nice boy. Very nice. Listen... - No whispering. - Cut it out, please! Not at all, honestly. Well... Goodbye. Goodbye "Teddy Bear". Goodbye "Teddy Bear". Goodbye. Seventeen minutes to twelve. - In 17 minutes, we can go. - It's a long time, 17 minutes. - Jacqueline... - Hmm... What do you want out of life? Love! Don't forget money. I'm ambitious. And you, Ginette? A man. And mind your own business. - And you, Jane? - Same as Ginette. How about Madam Louise? Like Jane, I say love: true, constant, lasting love. Do men expect as much of us? Don't talk about them. - Let's go. - Where? Feeding time! It's too early. Mr. Belin might see us. Ginette... Ginette, I'm afraid. Don't ask why. I won't tell you. See you later. Not eating with us? Not at the same table... Henri is introducing me to his parents. So it's the big day! Will you be at the zoo later, after your meal? No time. Henri's invited us all out tonight. Maybe to the music-hall. You free? - I can't go. - I can. Jacqueline? And you, Jacqueline? Me, too. Too bad, there's no free table. - Yes there is over there. - It's next to Rita. - It's my friends. - Don't you like them? Oh yes. They are nice. Hamburger and fries. Steak and fries... I'll have the radishes and a steak. - Me too. - Me too. - Chateaubriand for you? - No. We ordered fish. Chateaubriand for you? Listen to me, Margerite. Watch your diction when you talk to Dad. Frankly, don't you have a more suitable blouse? It's my best. Act as if you knew a bit about music and the arts. Talk about Michelangelo, for example... - That's it... Michelangelo. - OK. Hamburger. Better say your father is an foreman. Foreman. Try to appear up on wines and cuisine. He's a gourmet. Dad always has ice cream for dessert. - So order that. - Ice cream. Mom's a bit old fashioned about marriage. She has illusions. Something you didn't talk about in her day. If she talks about white dress and all that stuff... So watch it. - OK. - Get the idea? Yes, yes... Here they are. Don't forget the ice cream... and Michelangelo. - You know who he was? - A Renaissance painter. Painter, sculptor, architect, poet... Italian of the 16th century. Known for his breadth of vision! Noted for St Peter's in Rome, the Sistine Chapel, Moses, The statue of David The Last Judgement, The Creation of the World... and so on. Stand up. Mom! I hope you haven't been waiting too long. We've decided not to eat much, because we're getting fat. Dad, Mom, this is Rita. - Miss. - Miss. Rita, is that your first name? Yes, sir. - Are you Spanish? - No, Madam. A nickname, no doubt. Yes, Madam. Ready to order? - Just an omelet. - With truffles. - Not tinned are they? - Not in this establishment... I'm in the business. After your fish, for dessert, today's special? No. I'll have some ice cream. We're out. Now what? To the zoo. I'm meeting Andre at the monkey house. - Look inside! - They're so funny. Careful. Careful. You'll fall. To hell with it! Let's go and see something else. - Dirty beasts! - They feed off corpses. - That's harmless enough. - You think so. I don't like it. Come on. Let's go and find Andre. Hyenas. Hello my love! I love you. Hello Ginette. Hello Jacqueline. Aren't they cute? Aren't they beautiful? - I've got bananas for them. - Give me one. - Look. - That one. Take it. A little one for each. - He's like the pope. - A little one for each. Ah look at, it eats all. Wow, the big one! - Hello Papa. - Now who does he remind me of? Take it. Look at that, a turkey! No, it's a kagu. It's very rare. Listen. The kagu, peculiar to New Caledonia... ...much hunted for its plumage is almost extinct. It's a quiet bird. Cre... pus... cu... lar... Despite the wing development, the bird is poor in flight... ...but can run very fast. It lives in small group and its cry resembles the bark of a dog. It doesn't look very rare. - A turkey!!! - What they spend money on! This one is completely flat. Look at that... What a scene. Oh, look, a... rat! - It's a sand fox, silly! - Look at the rat. They're so nice. Little one. Little one. My sweet bunny. - Don't look around. - It's him. He's here watching you. - Are you sure? - Yes. Sure. That one doesn' look so good. Look! They've all got baths. - That one's shedding his skin. - He's crumbled. - This one bites... - In a flash! I hope the glass is good and strong. I'll protect you, darling. My dear... C'mon, let's go on. - What a smell! - Disgusting. It's funny too. - It looks rather fierce. - Could you go in there, Andre? The keepers do, don't they? - You wouldn't look so happy. - I've seen worse. Pussycat... kitty, kitty! - Eat! Eat! - It isn't hungry. Careful. That's a dangerous animal. The little painter's talking rubbish. It's so cute. Hello. Great big darling pussycat. He's a darling, a darling a darling, a darling... I'm completely wiped out! Shake you up! I was OK at the zoo but now I'm sleeping. Still 4 hours more. - Great! - It never ends. - Well, what are we doing now? - Don't know. Madam Louise! Hello "Teddy Bear". - I've got your bulbs. - More of these bulbs? - How are things? - Things are ok. - Business good? - OK. Can you sign here please? Thank you. Here you are. Madam Louise, won't you show us your fetish? Oh, no. Be a sport, Ma'am Louise. Go on. Satisfy our curiosity. No. I'm waiting for a special occasion and nothing happens now. - Right now, we're just bored. - What is it anyway? No. It's not a fetish, it's a souvenir. - A pressed flower? - A letter? - A man's sock? - I'm not saying anything. Well, I'll be seeing you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye "Teddy Bear". I'll wait for you in the porch opposite. - What is it? - Come with me. Come out with me tonight? - No. - Why not? No means no. That's all I've heard today. I do like you. But you love someone else, right? - Yes. - Who is he? - I don't know. - You don't know? We've never spoken. How come you love him? It's difficult to explain, but that's how it is. I just do. He's been following me around... but hasn't dared approach me. What a jerk! Any worse than you? Being shy doesn't mean you're stupid. Will you please come, Miss Ginette? Think she's having it off with the boss? That old ape! Don't be silly. She certainly is up to something, she goes off alone every evening. You who live with her, don't you know what? It's none of my business. - She must have a boyfriend. - Why shouldn't she? It's a mystery, like Madam Louise's fetish. It's not the same. If she had someone, she would be happy. She seems rather disillusioned with life. How naive you are! Didn't your ears burn? - What? - We talked about you. Rita was wondering where you go in the evenings. - It concerns her. - I meant no offense. Miss Jacqueline, one minute, please. What's got into him today? He's subjecting us all to an examination of conscience. Sales must increase in proportion to production. That's why I need sales girls... who are more than sales girls, my dear. He's here! - Can you knock? - He's here! - Who? - The motorcyclist! - He's gone. - Where to? Looked in and took off. - Embrace, repeat. - Abbraccio. - No! Is Venice nice, Madam Louise? I can hardly remember Venice anymore. - Madam Louise... - Yes? You wanted a special occasion to show your fetish. Please do it as a favor to me. - No but... - Wait. I need a special occasion for me. Perhaps, it'll bring me luck. - You won't tell anyone. - Of course I won't. Really? I'm hesitating. I wonder if I should though. It's very special thing, you know. - You don't want to? - I didn't say that. Don't rush me, please. I do it because you're in love. I hope it'll bring you happiness. You are too young to have heard of Weidman. It was a sadist who killed and robbed women. At 6 am on June 16th, 1939, he was guillotined at Versailles. I was just a girl then. He was so pale and handsome. Crowds came to watch, even climbing the trees. When the blade fell... the body jerked convulsively. Women cried out, but... I rushed to soak my hanky in the blood. 1 F a bunch... 1 F! Do you know what's bringing me down? To see nightfall. This shadow, here... it looks like a bearded man. At 3 am, he's got a huge nose. And when the sun's coming down, it's shortening. With that I know the time. At 6 am, unfortunately, they put the light on. That's it. The guy is immobile. No means to get your bearings. Then we feel blue, 'Cause we've got nothing to do. We can't know the time anymore. The nose stays immobile. What can we think about? Excuse me... Do you know the time, please? - Five to seven. - Thank you. You can go, Sylvie. Wait a minute! First call my wife and say I'm having dinner with... with... with... Leplantin, the scrap merchant. And be on the dot at nine tomorrow morning. Cheese, butter, cream... Will that be all? - Yes for today. - Checkout! - That's 12.50 madam. - May I go, Monsieur Henri? Of course not! Two minutes. I have you now, cursed woman! Not that. 1, 2, 3, 4... - Are you in love with your fiancée? - Of course I am. How did he manage that? He's well read, good family, different from the rest. Besides he loves me. He loves me. Pray we don't get a customer. Wake up! It's seven. - Already seven? - You bet it's seven. Have a nice evening, Madam Louise. - What are we going to do? - I have to go. Where to? - Never mind where. - Where? Wouldn't you like to know? More mystery again. It pleases me to hear it. I see enough of you during the day at work. In the evening I want to stay alone. - We were only teasing. - Sure. I see you. You know... you're even worse outside than at work. I'm in a hurry. Ciao Bambini. See you tomorrow. - So? - So, let's go. - Look at all the cars. - Yes, it's awful. They won't be able to move soon. Does your boyfriend's invitation still hold? Yes. Eight thirty at the box office. I'll go and change clothes. Bye. Have you seen? Let's go quick. You, you, you, you. When at home, I should fear. You, you you, you. Your voice is all I hear. You, you, you, you. Beneath the laurels just the two of us. You, you you, My whole being yearns for you. You, you you, you. Should my heart be cold as snow? You, you you, you. Your gentleness soon melts my woe. In those depths where dreams lie. Happiness will never die. Because of you. Pulcinella You, you you, you. Come into my arms. You, you you, you. - Who is he? - Miguel Santos. - Never heard of him. - Don't you know anything? Ladies and Gentlemen... Miguel is quite overcome. I assure you. Let me now present Charlie Boston and his cadets... offering you an electrifying rhythm with dynamism. Charlie Boston and his Cadets. I'm absolutely delighted to be with you again here... After our triumphant American tour. Let me introduce my cadets. Here, for you, is Town Girl! Mom! I can't do it. What's the matter? What's wrong my dear? - They're here. - Who? The girls I work with. - What can I do? - Calm down. What is it? What's up with her? Why is she blubbering? People she knows are here. I don't know. Hurry and get ready. You're on in three minutes. Please, no trouble. Wear your costume. I like singing here, but I can't... Why? I couldn't bear them knowing. I work with them all the day long. They'll never stop ragging me. You just don't know... It's a real hell. Being with them all day from nine to seven. And I live at Jane's. It's the only respite I get. I love singing, I love art... but if they see me, I'm finished. That's all very well but just get yourself ready. Move it now. No real artist ever missed her show. Oh women...! - He's a hot stuff, Charlie Boston. - Don't be common, please. Now my dear friends, if I may describe you all as our happy family here... Let me introduce the famous Italian singer... Angela Torini! This song... with music by Franco Baldoni and lyrics in French by Claude Avenue, "As Soon As You Left" As soon as you left me alone, I never thought of anything but finding you again. I wandered the night. Time's flying away and hurting me. What a pain! As soon as I think about our love lost for ever. Searching in backcountry and hidden places, I tried all I can but I didn't know how to forget you. Maybe tomorrow, at the end of the road, I'll see your eyes. I'll feel good. Your faithful hound I will be. You my lord in mastery. In the meantime... What a pain! As soon as I think about our love lost for evermore. Lost for evermore. - Hey... - What? That's Ginette! Ginette, from work? I can't believe it. It's fantastic. Wow... Shit! Clear off miss. What's going on here? - Allow me to congratulate you. - No. It was awful. Not at all. Not at all. - Will you have diner with me? - Leave me alone! So? It was good. What did I say? I'm sure none of them recognized you. If they did... I will die. - I don't think so. - Finally see. They'll come rushing. Come on. She said nothing, so we shouldn't butt in. - Oh yeah? - Let's be respectful. Don't be so sensitive! Don't go, so she'll never know we recognized her. Come on. It'll be fun. She wasn't so bad. Where's Ginette? There, there, Ginette! - Don't be so grim. - There's no need. You were really good. Let's celebrate. By doing what? It's almost ten. So what... I have an idea. Splash! You look just fine, strong. I wouldn't complain. You put on weight in a sedentary job. You're big, not fat. The worst is to be fat. No! I'm not big. I'm fat. Come on. The place is packed with girls. I'm going to get a towel. Relaxing, isn't it? Plenty of choice! What a choice. Hello miss. What did I tell you? Oh look there! Look who's here! - Where? - There. - Who? - Look. - It's those same girls. - That's really fantastic. Let's go and say hello. C'mon, easy... - So we meet again? - We seem to meet everywhere. That's luck. It's not my fault. - Hello miss. - Hello. Won't you introduce us? Ginette. Ginette, Albert. Very honoured, Honore de Balzac! Pleased to meet you. Rita, Marcel. My respects. - Henri, Marcel and Albert. - Honoured to meet you. Well, pleased to meet again all this nice people. What are you doing tonight? - We're with this gentlemen. - He's welcome. Don't worry. We won't take them away. Enjoying yourself? Coming in? - No. I just got out. - You're too young to be lazy. Come on! Let's go, Jane!! No, I said no. OK, OK... I'll settle for Albert, then. Come on, Albert. Listen? Agreed? Let's go. In with her! What did you do that for? All of them in now! Look what you did to me! Do you think it's nice? Bastards! Leave them alone. It's... You're misbehaving! Misbehaving... Bastards! Do you think you're clever? Leave them alone. Jackass! Shut up! You silly girl! Go to hell! That's enough! - My Jane, do you forgive me? - Get away!! Go on be nice. - You fool!! - You making trouble too? I love you. - No I didn't say you could go. - Dirty brute. Did I hurt you? I didn't mean to, darling. I'll kiss and make it better. Leave me alone! Stay in the water. - That's enough. - My sweet Jane... No! Leave her alone. Can't one have fun? Get away! This young lady isn't glad. My apologies, lady. I didn't know we offended you. Excuse me. Well played! - Leave her alone. - Mind your own business. - Take it easy. - I'll bust him one! Leave her I said. Otherwise I'll hurt you. Don't tell me what to do. I didn't touch anyone. I'm a respectable, hard working citizen! Not everyone can say the same. Thank you, sir. No need for thanks. My name's Ernest. I'm Jacqueline. Jacqueline Dubourg. Ernest Lapierre. Thanks a lot, sir. - You scared them away, bravo! - Thanks mister. - Ginette, Mr Ernest. - Pleased to meet you. - Pleased to meet you miss. - Jane. Pleased to meet you. - Rita. - Pleased to meet you. - Henri. - Pleased to meet you. Are you happy? Yes, Ernest. Do you love me? You're rushing things. After all, we only met last night. What? After all, we only met last night. Why were you following me? - Because I like you. - I saw you everywhere. Are you so shy? I'm waiting for a special occasion. And you? - Do you love me? - Of course. Or I wouldn't have followed you. That proves nothing. It wasn't easy... following someone. It's complicated. It takes time. I did it because I love you. - Noodles... one plate! - OK, it's on. Can I tell you something? Wait... we may sincerely speak. I want to tell you. It got me worried... wondering what you wanted... where you found the time. - Don't you work? - Yes. I'm mechanic. I start a new job next week. I saw you everywhere. I didn't dare hope... For what? Well... That you were following me... because you loved me. Please! I adore your neck. - Why especially? - It's so long and slender. The way you hold it, too. You're delicate and graceful. That's what I love. And so serious. Not like all these brainless girls. Shall we start? Listen! - Careful, don't hurt yourself. - Not at all. But, stop it! Watch this. That's not so funny. I'm surprised at you. Excuse me. You sometimes forget you're with a girl. Do you truly love me? Truly. Do you trust me? Yes. Yes, but... - What? - It's complicated. I was following you... We were looking for each other... but suppose love wasn't the reason. I don't understand. Suppose for instance... I don't know how to put it. - You don't love me. - It's not that. I think you maybe are too trustful of people who follow you. You tell me that! I'm not as stupid as you think. What would you have wanted with me? I have nothing. No money. Nothing. So? What else is there? Love. Shall we go? Impressive, isn't it? These great trees. The sky seen through them... the silence... You can't help thinking of the creator. Let's go there. - It's all thorns. - There's a path. It's not very nice. Let's go and see. I love mysterious places. - Ernest? - What? Is that how you love me? If I read you right, you needn't worry. Oh, my stocking. Yes, your stocking! I'm cold. Balthazard! C'mon, this way! Hurry up!
