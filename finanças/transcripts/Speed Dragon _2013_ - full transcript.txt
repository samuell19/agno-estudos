You mean you love me. I don't love you. Come on. Everybody loves me. Dylan. Listen to me. You shouldn't fall in love. Why? 'Cause you're a rock star. Rock stars are not allowed to fall in love.

Hell, yeah. I'm so glad you're back here with me. I'm so, so happy to be here with you. Yeah, just don't get your face kicked in, again, huh? That's not cool, asshole! I almost died! From a broken nose? More serious than that. I nearly bled to death. That's too bad. Wish you would've bled to death, you fucking bitch. Hey. Gary. I can handle this. Come here. So. You think that hairdo can make you a star? Gimme a break. Without Dylan, you're nothing. I don't even have time for you people right now. My people? He's such an ass! You're a racist pig! Do you know how powerful China is right now? You're a stupid idiot. What do you mean by gong? Asian? First of all, I don't know what the fuck you're even talking about. Second of all.

I dunno, I'm out of shit. You chill tonight. You don't look so good. No. I just need more shit. Too early. Tweakers don't sleep! Your heart is beating so fast! I'm gonna call a doctor. No. I'm fine. I just need more shit. Not tonight, okay? Promise! Hold on, Jackie. I love you. What? I love you. Why, Dylan? Because I get you high? I told you not to fall in love. What? Don't you love me? No, I'm sorry, I, I don't fall in love with rock stars. Everybody loves me! I knew this would happen. But this isn't love, Dylan. Are you being serious right now?' Yes, I'm serious, I'm sorry. Jackie. Why are you doing this to me? I thought you loved me. It isn't what you think. Wake up, Dylan. You're in love with the power, that everyone loves you. It's an illusion. You love me, because you love the power you hold over me. You love me, because I'm not like all these other little groupies, chasing after you. You love me because I don't really give a damn. I just accept you. And allow you to be who you are. But you know something I've noticed? In your heart you're really in love with the power. And fame. Dylan, look at me. I think people meet for a reason. Maybe I'm just here to wake you up. I never loved you. Everybody loves me! I'm a motherfucking rock star! You think you're the only rock star? Anytime, anywhere, somebody could be the next star. Fuck you! Go take a shower. It will make you feel better. Who you calling? Uh, Jimmy. Hey, Jimmy! Jimmy, can you hear me? JIMMY: Yes, I can hear you. Jimmy Dylan's sick. I think I should call 911. JIMMY: You will do no such thing. He's really sick. I really have bad feeling about this. JIMMY: Good. What did you say? His heart is beating so fast! And still asks for speed! JIMMY: Then get him more speed. I'm not paying you to be his nurse. I'm paying you to fuck him up. He wants drugs, you get him drugs. He wants to fuck, you fuck! You let him do anything that he wants. Don't you have a heart? JIMMY: Heart doesn't bring you any money in this business. Jimmy. How can you live with yourself? Cheating and screwing with other peoples' lives? You're such an evil spirit. Jimmy, I'm sorry, I can't do this anymore. I think, I think, I think you should find somebody else. JIMMY: Not you, too. Why don't you go live in Palm Springs with Betty? Maybe you can hang out at Dinah Shore's. Fuck you! Fuck! Dylan? Dylan? Yes. Yes! Please, please send somebody quick to the room!
