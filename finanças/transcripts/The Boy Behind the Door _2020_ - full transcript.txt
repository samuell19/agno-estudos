I can't run! My legs hurt! I can't wait till we're older. We can leave this place. Where do you want to go? Just somewhere different. Somewhere where the sun's always shining. Like today. California. Let's go. Really? Promise you won't go without me? Of course. Itsfnends till the end, right? Friends to the end. - Bam. - Oh! Kevin, hurry up! We have to go to the game! Come on! Kevin? Kevin? Kevin!

Now, I'm going to point out the windows and doors. Do you understand? We'll be all right here. We ll be all right here if someone comes to rest, but we'll have to work together. You'll have to help. Now, I want you to go in and get some wood so I can board the place up. Do you understand? Okay? Okay? Man: Shhhhh. Don't cry. There's nothing to cry about. It's okay. Shh, you're safe here. You are. Man: Hey. What's going on? What's wrong? Man: Come on, don't do that. Do not cry. Stop now. What was that? It's okay. You don't have to hide from me. I just want to talk. I'm not gonna hurt you.

Don't worry, I'm gonna find keys. Aw, come on. Bobby? Bobby. Hey, I'm gonna drive and get help. - What do you mean? - I can't find the keys. Yeah, but you can't drive. I-I'll be right back. - Bobby! - Just trust me! And that's the thing... These aren't lawabiding Americans. These aren't good people. These are rapists. These are criminals. Now, I'll tell you something... They're coming for you. They're coming for your jobs. They're coming for your women. Vvhoa. Vvhoa! They take and take till they... No, no, no, no, no. - Come on! - They want to take your guns. No, no, no. No! Come on! Augh! Bobby: Kevin, I need you. Bobby, did you find help? I found a phone. It's like the ones you see in movies. It's big, heavy. It has a curly cord thing. Oh, my grandma has one of those. I-I don't know how it works. You need to plug it into a wall. It doesn't have a plug. Well, there should be some cord around, and it... it looks like an Internet cable. Dang it. Come on, come on, come on. Agh! Ugh! Yes! Kevin, it's working! Woman: 911. What's your emergency? Yeah, w... me and my friend have been kidnapped. Woman: What's your name, sir? - Bobby. Bobby green. - Okay, Bobby. Is the person that took you still there? - Can they hear you? - No, they're gone. But my friend's still stuck. You have to hurry, please. We 're tracking your location. Can you tell me anything about where you are? - It's a house. - Okay, a house. Do you know where it is? There's a lot of grass and trees and a big oil rig out front. Oh! Ooh! Bobby, hide! Woman: See anything else... He... he's back. He just came back. You have to hurry, please. Woman: Help be there soon. Just stay on the line. We almost have your location. Just stay with me a little longer. No, I have to go. Woman: Is there a place you can hide? No! No, he'll find me! He'll see me! He'll see the body, okay? - Bobby, talk to me. - I have to go. Woman on TV: Do you really think... Man on TV: I don't think anything. I just know that I'm going to my room. And if anybody comes in, I'll shoot him. Okay. Augh... Woman on TV: Oh, I wish this night were over. Man on TV: Those are guns. I tell you, it doesn't make any difference. They're not through with us yet. Certainly not. Man on TV: And right as somebody else in this house who once has left his room. Did you hear anything? Organ music. That and someone walking. You look downstairs, and I'll look out here. Why not together? There may be only minutes, seconds left of someone's life! Why waste time? It's almost over, Nelly. You really keep the hours passing. What's happening? We've done it. A pen'ect crime. Beautiful. Ahh... Kevin: What are you doing? What is that? Please! I just want to go home! Please. I won't cry, I swear. I swear. Ple... please don't! Please! Please! [Thud! 1 Gah! Get away! Please, go away! Just go away! Why?! Please, stop! Augh! Help! Help! I'm up here! Please! Hello?! Please! Up here at the window! Please!

Man on TV: There is a pattern to all that lives! An order, an arrangement! She had a heart, and a brain, and her spirit was in both! Not in one or the other! I'll give her a brain and a heart. Yes, and what of her soul? You say you love her and... You can remember her love for you. Then how can you make of her an experiment of horror? All the skill and science I possess was meant for this. Life has a pattern. The whole pattern of my life is shaping itself to save her now. Then, you intend to go through with it? Yes. Good evening. Are you the owner of this residence? Yes, I am. Can you cut that down? I'm sorry. Are you the owner of this residence? Yes. Yes, I am. May I ask what this is about? We received a distress call about a suspected kidnapping. Dispatch traced it to this general area. Oh, my god. You're kidding. In this area? Have you seen anything unusual tonight? No, no. It's just another quiet night around here. Except for the TV, of course. It's just nice to hear something in the background. Mm. Do you have any kids, miss...? Burton. Uh, no. No kids. What about a Mr. Burton? Are you making a pass at me, officer? No, ma'am, I'm not. It's just me. Can I see some I.D., miss Burton? Of course. It's, uh, just right inside. I'll be back in a minute. Ms. Burton! Miss Burton, can you hurry this up, please? Ms. Burton, I'm comin' in! Man on TV: People fear what they don't understand. And what they can't see. Ms. Burton! Man on TV: No, what are you talking about? You're nothing a freak of life. And a freak of death! Why should I be afraid of a few locks on the door? But last night, you ran. Hello? Ms. Burton? Help us! Oh, my god. Gah! Ungh. Open the door, kid. Open... the goddamn... door. Okay, listen to me. I know you're scared, but I'm coming in there one way or another. So, if you open the door, I promise you, I will not hurt you. Do it! Let me in. Come on! Open the door! Open the goddamn door! Open the door, bitch! Fuck it! You know, I never really planned on taking you out of that trunk. I figured you'd suck all the air out and that'd be the end of it. But, here we are. My friends like tough boys, though. Not like your crybaby buddy upstairs. They actually pay good money for the ones who put up a fight. They don't normally go for ones who look like you, but I think they'll make an exception. You know what? Since you clearly like your little fucking friend, how about I swap you out for your pal? How does that sound? Ugh! Augh! Oh, fuck! God damn it. Kevin. Kevin. Kevin. Get away from me! - Away from me! - Kevin! Kevin, it's me! It's me Bobby. It's me. Bobby. You didn't leave me. You didn't leave me. You didn't... - Did he...? - No. Here, put this on. She's still downstairs. We need to get you out of here, okay? You have to help me puh, okay? One, two, three. One more time. Be right back, okay? I promise. Okay. What are you doing? Just trust me, okay? It'll be all right. Just back up a little bit. Three, two... Ow! Oh, god! Kevin, what... Kevin, what is it?! Come on. Augh! I have an idea. N... no, no! Don't leave me again! Don't leave me! Bobby: Listen, listen! Listen, okay? Don't leave me again. The worst thing that could have happened to us already happened. Just stay here. I'll be right back. Gah! Rghh! No, let me... let me go! Ow! No! Ah! Oh, god! Oh, my god! My finger! You cut off my fucking finger! You're dead! Do you hear me?! You're dead! You little shit. Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Just say something! Come on. Oh! Fuck you! Ungh! Hey! We've gotta go! - Mm... - We've gotta go! I can't. What do you... yes, you can! Kevin, you have to go. No! No! Bobby: You have to. Do you know what you told me? Friends till the end, remember? This is not the end. God... Boys! Okay. Let's go. Come on. Hello? Can anyone hear me? Officer: Last unit, please identify yourself oh. My name is Kevin o'Connor, and I need help. Please send someone. Officer: Sir, this is a restricted frequency. If you have an emergency, please dial 911. We don't... we don't have a phone. Um, she already killed the other officer. Please. Officer: What is your location? U-Um, I-I don't know. It's a farmhouse, and i-it looks far away. I'm in a cop car. Officer: Find a safe place to hide. Officers are on their way. Okay. Here. I got something. Move your hand. Okay. Uh, here. Don't move, okay? - Okay. - Three, two, one. Thank you...

I don't see her anywhere. Sit down. Hey, I think she's gone. Ugh! Agh... Hrgh! Agh! Get away from him! Agh! Gah! - Get down! - God! Get off of me! Ah! Guh! Agh! Gah! [ Muffled thud 1 Adam244.
