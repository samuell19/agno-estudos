- It's fucking dead tonight, guys. - He's sure to make his dick hurt tonight. I got bills to pay. - Right. - Mm, that reminds me. The other day I was with this John, right? - Uh hmm. - You could tell he was new. He asked if I had protection. I said, "Baby, I got studded, I got ribbed, "I got lubed, I've got flavored, "I even got lambskin! "What the fuck you need?" He looks at me and says, "Jumbo." Oh god, please. - I said, "Honey, that costs extra, I am not that loose." He paid good too. - I bet. Yesterday, somebody asked me for a $50 blowjob. I was like, "Bitch, swerve on, hun." I ain't no $50 blowjob. You see this? - Gonna give me more than that, uh-hum. Cinnamon yesterday Kit-Kat, she tried to fuck one of my regulars. - Oh, you broke ho code? - Oh, girl she stole him from me. - Uh hmm. - Shit. Keep that up, you're not going to be able to work this with us. You're gonna have to get your own pimp. What do you think April? - Hi! - Yeah, you're gonna have to find your own if you keep pulling on ours. - We'll see about that. All right girl, I'm out of here. - All right, peace. - Have a good one. - Hope she got some lube. She gonna get pounded tonight. - So the other day this guy kept going "Oh baby baby," I said "Honey, you need to stop "calling me baby, that is not my name." He said "Oh, ah, what's your name?" I said "It's April!" He said "Oh like the month?" I said "It is May, asshole!" - Yeah why do they even care what your last name is? Emilee? - Oh I know. - You know, sh... I'm Emilee! Who cares - who cares what our name? I, call me whatever the fuck you want! - Right. - As long as you pay me I don't give a shit. - That's damn straight. Show me the money. - All right guys, there's no money tonight, I'm peaceing out, - All right. - So long. - Take care you guys. - Well here's one. - Hey! - Hey baby! Fuck you in your mini van. - All right, I'm out of here. - Have a good night. - We'll see you girl. - See you. Fuck you. Fuck this night, I'm out. - You know, this is bullshit, how many cars do you think last night? - Speaking of blowing Jamie, how many have you done tonight? Very funny. You know I have an idea, what if I showed a little leg? You think maybe that would work? It worked in the olden days. Yeah but, they're all dead. - Yeah that's true, and a guy couldn't give two shits, about a girl showing leg when they can go home, on their computer and jerk off. Exactly. - What the fuck? You thief! - Mother fuck! Little fucking son of a bitch! What the fuck, what the fuck! Wait, wait, come here! Here, listen, listen! There is no way, that my life is ending, in some alley, in the middle of nowhere, by some fucker, with a wire wrapped around my neck, and I got news for you, it ain't ending for you tonight either! You ain't checking out tonight. Oh, oh... - Yeah, thanks to you. I'm done. No, that's too... - Oh my god my shoes my shoes! - Wait, I saved your life once, I ain't doing it again! - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Amanda, Amanda! What the fuck? Open up! Get your own ride bitch! - Darcy thank you so much for coming to see me, you have no idea! I've contacted everyone, all the media, no one is interested in my story. Thank you so much. Well, I've got a lot to tell you. I tried to tell you on the phone, my brother, he's been accused of these horrendous beheadings, and if he's to go to jail again it's gonna be for the rest of his life, and,, he may not be the greatest guy, but he is not a murderer. - I get it, I do. Please, go on. - I don't know where to start. I mean we were normal kids, you know, normal, you know, doing normal kid things, going to school. But then, god, our mother, our mother was a monster! - Rachel do you want to forget about his for now, because I can always come back later tonight-- - No just the, just the thought of her just... It's okay, go ahead. - As long as you're comfortable with it, we can continue, okay? - All right, this is too important, I have to get the story out. I'm such an ugly crier! No you're not! - All right, go ahead. - Whenever you're ready, your mother, you were talking about her. - Yeah, her, you would not believe the things that she did to us when we were kids. Like, you would not believe it. - You know what though, you wouldn't believe half of the things that I have heard in face to face interviews! I mean think about it, I work for Crime Scene Magazine, not People. - That's true. - Trust me, I think I can handle it. - I think you could. Where do we go from here? My mother. She was sick, so sick! - Cancer, or... - If only it was cancer, no, she was sick in the head! - How so? - This woman was pure evil. It didn't, we didn't have to do anything wrong, and, I mean she would just hit us for no reason! Oh... If she could be carrying a book, or anything, a bat it didn't matter, she would just hit us on the back of the head! - For just no reason at all? - No, she didn't need a reason! She ruled the roost, I mean, we all knew it, Dad knew it, and I mean, he tried to, he tried, he tried to help us but, that, that didn't matter. Oh and if we actually did do something wrong, then there was the belt. - The belt? Yeah, she would run into our father's room, grab, the belt off the back of his door, and she would come storming down like she was demon possessed! - Wait a minute you said she went into your father's room? - Uh-hmm. - You mean your parents, they had separate bedrooms? - Yeah, if you were married to a bat like that would you want to sleep with her? - I don't know. - Dad, Dad tried to, he tried to be there for us but, he was gone all the time, so it just, it was just us and her. He left us to fend for ourselves, he was, gone... - I can't blame him, for not wanting to be around her. - Yeah. As soon as Danny, the, our little brother turned 18, he was up and packed up, and took another job in freaking Ohio. - So, can we back up a sec? Can you tell me what your mother did to you? - Yes, yes, once... Just the thought of this is really upsetting me. Um, yeah she would beat us with a belt, till we had purple welts all over our whole bodies. The boys nicknamed it the Welt Belt. They got it more often than I did, I think she thought she could cover up bruises on boys, and not so much on me, so... - That's really despicable. - Oh you think? Oh, and get this, when Dad was still around, we had this horrible neighbor, I mean you probably had the kind who will call the cops for the stupidest ... - This is the third time that I've had to come over here, and tell you keep your kids' toys off my property, and that means keep your son's balls off my grass! This is gonna stop or I'm gonna call the cops! And I'm gonna keep on calling the cops every time your bratty little kids do something to bother my family! Do you hear me Mrs Leno? Or do I have to yell? Are you deaf, and stupid, and-- - Oh, it's you. You know what, go back to the hole you crawled in from you bitch! Glad to help you with the day's exercise, pig! - Wow, I thought that we had crazy next door neighbors growing up! - Right? Well hey, would you like a donut? I've got a donut, I'll split one with you. - Sure I'll take part of one. - Perfect. Yeah, neighbors are a, our neighbor on the other side, they were, they were pretty cool, at least the guy was. - Right. - Hi wife on the other hand, yeah she would parade around her yard, in a bikini, all summer long. Yeah, and then she'd think she sees Danny watching her from his upstairs bedroom window. - Oh my god. - Probably Jacking off. - Your brothers. - Exactly. Well she comes over, and tells mother, that she catches Danny red-handed, peeping into her room. Yeah the beating that he took, um, he spent two weeks in the hospital. Two weeks, the school did not even notice. - I mean how is that even possible? I mean didn't you kids ever think about reporting her for child abuse, or what about your grandparents, or neighbors, friends-- - You can do that, you can do that now, but back then, we just, we just took our lickings. Mom was a monster. - Well um, when did the beatings end? I mean they did end sooner or later-- - Yeah, oh yeah, yeah. Jake, he got in trouble for something, I don't even remember what it was exactly. But I do remember what happened afterward. - Oh Jesus, what happened afterwards? - Oh, let me tell you. Yeah the three of us were, playing in the house and we heard this pounding on the door. Mother took her time to get there. She opens the door and this man is yelling and screaming at her, she didn't say anything. Then she just slams the door in his face, and she turns around, and she comes storming down like she just escaped a mental institution. She goes into Dad's room, comes out with that belt, and she's just snapping that belt, she's coming for us, and I, I tried to shield Danny, cover him up, but she went right for Jake. She's just whipping him with this belt, wham, wham, whipping him! I yelled at her to stop, but no, she just keeps whipping him and Jake he, I don't know what got into him, he just grabbed that belt from her, and they're wrestling back and forth, he yanks that belt right out of her hand and she's like in shock! She grabs her heart, uh, and she just keels over, has a heart attack, falls right on the ottoman. Jake, he didn't know what happened, he looks at us and, he's in shock. He comes over, and we hug, and we thought this is, this is a good thing. Her death gave us new life. Does that make sense Darcy? - It absolutely does, but of the two boys, which one was in trouble more often, or were they both just equal opportunity victims? - Oh no no no no, it was not equal at all! Jake was older, and he always seemed to be on the receiving end of all this. Mother would yell, "See what happens to Jacob "when you pull this shit?" I swear that is the reason that he went to the bottle. I mean seriously drinking, upwards of a full fifth of whiskey in a day! - Wow. - Yeah, he went to calling his favorite brand Jake Daniels. Yeah when he was drinking, oh he was nasty! - I mean have you ever thought about like intervention, or AA, or anything like that? - Yeah, he needed a 20-step program, not a 12-stepper. Yeah, when he drank, he turned into this, wife-beating menace! He, he went to prison two times, yeah, for domestic violence, and the cops came to his house all the time. - So after all this how did you two end up reconnecting? Wait, you know I'm sorry, hold that thought, what happened to your younger brother, uh, - Daniel? - Daniel, you said, okay? - Yeah, well Danny, he seemed to get through this really well, he got married, bought a house, has kids, white picket fence, yep, going good for him. - Well you obviously did very well for yourself too Rachel, I mean... - Uh yeah, this is just the perks of uh, being a Real Estate Broker. - Well it's beautiful. - Yeah, yeah it is. - It is, uh huh, so unless I miss my guess here, this is all about Jake, he's the reason that I'm here. - Yeah, Jake, - Is that right? - Yeah he vanished after his two stints at Jackson Prison. - Right. - And I was, I was fine with that, I thought he just, just get his shit together and go on with his life. - So what made you decide to try and find him again then? - He's a suspect in a-- - I mean I get that Rachel, I do, and I know that you want me to pass that information on to authorities, - Yes. - But, I can't just walk in there and say "Hey I interviewed his sister," you know, "stop your investigation!" - I get that. - And I really do, I want to help you. - You know and I, and I, I believe you. - Why don't you give me some more information, like um, tell me about how you two finally reconnected. - Well Danny and I, we, we never lost contact, we've kept in touch, and I've went to his house, to see if he knew where, where Jacob was. - Well look what the cat dragged in. If it isn't my little big sister. - Really? I even wore my big shoes for you. You act like you haven't seen me in years. - It sure seems like it, to me anyway. - Are you gonna let me in? - Come on in. So what's up, wait, let me guess. You've been watching the news reports, and you want to know where our big brother Jake is, am I close? - Yeah, actually you're right on the money with that one. - Well come on in. - Sure. So, where are Donna and the kids? - She took the kids to the mall. - Oh, that's probably a good thing. - Go and have a seat. - Thanks. - So, what makes you think I know where Jake is, anyway? - Do you or don't you Danny, because you know we're both a little too old to be playing this stupid game. - Take a look around sis, I've been a little busy, trying to raise a family, provide for my wife and kids, while our big brother was off making license plates. - So you don't know where he is, fine! - That's it then, the end of our chat? Huh, nice, real nice Rachel, couldn't give two shits about me could you? - I do care about you, you're my little brother, but, you're not the one in trouble. - Would you like something to drink right now? - Oh please. - Lemonade okay? - Yes. - Listen, I had a lousy spring season at the nursery, I got four mouths to feed, I got bills to pay. Like I said, I got troubles too. Your troubles are fixable, they're not with the law! You watch the news! - Yeah well, I tell you what, if I did know where he was, you wouldn't want to see him anyway. He's probably stewing up there on his daily bottle of Jake Daniels anyway. - Up where? - Huh? - You said he's busy stewing up there. - Chill out sis, what are you gonna do, you gonna ride up there on your white horse and save the day? Do you know where he is? Just tell me. - All these years, and suddenly you're interested in him? Stay the hell out of it! He'll get what he has coming to him. - Wow you really don't care about him do you? - Don't put this on me, Rachel Marie Leno! - You know what, fine, I don't know why I even bothered. You know I would have thought that you would have uh, had some consideration - Wait. - For any of us. - I'm sorry. Come here, I'll fill you in. I know you're worried about Jake. - Thanks Danny, you know it's-- - Sit back down. - I am, I'm just, I'm afraid for Jake! - Well, you're right to be, okay? Our big brother is prime suspect, and he's way over his head if you ask me. - I'm just worried about him, that's all. Danny, you don't think Jake is capable of this, do you? - Oh hell no, he's scared. That's why he's hiding out. - Please, just tell me where he is. - Brewster house, but he's wanted Sis, and he's wanted in a bad way. - Brewster house, man I should of thought of that a long time ago! What are we gonna do? - I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We're gonna cooperate with the authorities. If any cops come around, we're gonna have to be honest, and tell 'em about Jake's not so glorious past. - But just because he has a violent past that shouldn't be a reason for them to consider him for this? You think? - Nah, that's not it at all. - Well then what is it? - Look, when Jake sold the house he was perfectly fair with us, but you remember all the instrument parts, and the tools in the garage. - Oh there was a bunch of that stuff, - Yes! - Wasn't there? Guitar fret board, there was that big bass stand in the back too, there was a, there was a lot of it. - -And the mound of piano wire? Hello! The damn fool, tried to score some cash on the side, and not let us in on it? He sold a shit load of it. I mean, he probably needed the money but-- - Yeah, but the killer is using piano wire to decapitate those poor girls-- - Exactly! That's why he's the prime suspect. - We need to see him, we have to convince him that he's gotta be questioned by the authorities! - Well we'll go see him, okay? - So you guys went up to the Brewster house, um, but weren't you a little apprehensive? - Well I don't know about apprehensive, but I had to talk some sense into Jake. I mean if they pinned these murders on him, he'd go to the jail for the rest of his life. Michigan had the death penalty, he'd fry for sure. So yeah, so I just went up to the Brewster house. - Wait hand on a minute, what do you mean, I went up to the Brewster house? What, just you, are you kidding me? - I had to go right away and Danny, he had the kids and his wife and it's like, yeah, I just went by myself. - So, Danny boy told you where I was, huh? - Yeah he did. - So why the sudden visit, huh? Look, let me guess. The cops are asking questions about me. They're trying to pin those murders on me. All because I sold that piano wire from the god damn garage. Shit, I was gonna share it with you guys. I swear to god! - You know what Jake? - I wish that, I wish... - If you were hard up for cash you could have come to your brother or sister and we could have figured out some way to help you out, and then if there would have been any questions you know, would'a been all of us siblings that they'd be looking at, and the heat wouldn't be just on you. - Oh great, hind-sight's always 20-20. - I know. - Now I got the law breathing down my neck, and they're probably gonna put me in the slammer. And I'm not going back there Rach, no fucking way, no way! - But it's multiple murders that you're facing! How do the cops know about the wire sale? Oh, Bonny. I'm sure of it, ex-number two, remember her? If anybody wanted revenge against me for punching her lights out, it'd be that bitch. - Oh, Bonny. - Well, here in the last thumb fight, the topic of that psychopath killer popped up, you know, and she said in this really weird tone, "Jacob," and you know I hate being called that, 'cause that was mother used to call me that-- - Yeah when she'd pull out the Welt Belt I know. I can't even look at a belt without flinching. - Tell me about... - Shitty way to remember a parent, right? - So anyway, she goes "Jacob, you have some real "aggressive tendencies, who's to say you're not "the serial killer?" And then she goes "Wouldn't it be interesting if the "police found out you sold that piano wire?" And me, you took it for personal reasons. So I didn't take any chances then, I left the east side and I came here, where it's safe, until the real killer's caught. - And you told Danny you moved here and not me? - I couldn't tell you my story. You get all judgemental and shit, - No I don't! - You do. Last thing I need is an interrogation from you as well as the cops, you know. - Well, you know, I kind of get it, but, if you had nothing to do with any of this, then... - Well then a long pause. If you think for one second I had anything to... There's a door you can leave right now! And don't come back this time! - No no Jake, Jake, Jake! You know you may, do some awful things, and you've got a bad temper, but, there's, you're flesh and blood, there's no way I know you are capable of killing anyone, unless maybe they wanted to harm me, or Daniel or Dad. So now I'm sticking around and we're gonna, we're gonna get through this. Blood is thicker than water. Even Flint water , Jacob. - Right, what am I gonna do, what am I gonna do next? - Well, we're gonna, we're gonna sit here until we can figure out how to get over this nightmare. - You gotta be up front with me Rachel, at some point during this conversation, you must have had second thoughts about Jacob. Oh, I'm sorry, I meant Jake. Don't apologize, that was actually kind of funny. But not even for a fraction of a second. - Yeah. - He's really a decent guy deep down, it's just the idiot does not know how to treat women. - Yeah. - I'm not a psychologist or anything, but, if he saw a therapist I'm sure they would tell him that, all this anger that he has, that stems from the abuse that he got from our despicable mother. - Well that sounds right to me Dr. Phil. - Excuse me. - Okay. Oh Miss Leno would, don't don't please don't slam the door, please don't slam the door! Please let me talk. - All right. Come on in. - Thank you. - Yeah just, follow me. - Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, I didn't know you were-- - That's all right. Detective Ryker I'd like you to meet Darcy Miller. - Excellent. - She's a stringer with, Crime Scene Magazine. - Very nice to meet you. - I called her editor, and, it, she's the only one that would come see me. The fact that you showed up here is actually, pretty good timing. - Well it's nice to meet you Officer Ryker. - My pleasure. - Uh, it's not officer Darcy, it's detective, that's a distinction that he's, he's worked long and hard for. - That's true, thank you. Um I thank you for that distinction, I appreciate it. Um, I want to ask you a question Miss Leno, and, and I don't mean to, I don't mean to come off like a dick, or anything, but, why are you being so cooperative with me right now? Now last time, about a week or so ago, you were anything but. You were almost combative. So why all of a sudden - Well because, because you, -, it must be her? - Well you were a dick! You put me on the defensive, you, had all the oddest accusations about my brothers, and I tried to keep my cool, so, I, I slammed the door on you. But, look at this, you're being very civil right now, and I'll be very civil, so we can just get down to what we were talking about. I went and saw my brother, I went up to his house. - Whoa, whoa, wait wait, you went to Jacob Leno's house? It's uh, a week ago you told me, you had no I, wait a minute, you told me you had no idea where he was, you had, you, just, not a clue and now all of a sudden you went to his house. - This, this is the attitude I'm talking about, do, do you want my help or not? I'm, willing to help you! - Of course I do. But uh, all right, all right, no attitude. - Okay. - We'll start over, um, I'm sorry, please go on. - Okay, thank you. First of all, when you speak to my brother, you can not call him Jacob. - Well what am I supposed to call him? - Well, you call him Jake, I mean that's a button you do not want to push with him. - Okay, okay. You know something, you could do yourself, and your brother, and me, a big favor if you would, organize some kind of a sit-down between the two of us. - Well, that's exactly, that's what I wanted to do! - All right so let's do that. - But I can't be responsible for his attitude! He is a serious whisky drinker, and oh, when he hits that bottle, oh there's just-- - Just just, wait a minute, wait a minute. I've been on the force for 39 years. I've seen every kind of crack whore, every kind of psychotic junkie, you name it, a lunatic pimp, I think I can deal with an alcoholic okay, so don't-- - Okay. - Hey, why don't you give him a call, please please please. - All right, okay. - Oh, before you do it, whatever you do don't tell him that I'm here, all right? I mean he doesn't need to-- - Detect-- - What? - He's my brother, you gotta trust me I know what I'm doing. - All right, you got your - Can I, can I go get, - phone on 'ya? - I'll, can I go get the phone, it's in the kitchen. - All right, yeah. Can you do me a favor while you're up, can you give me some water or something? - Oh, I am, I am so sorry. - I'm dying of thirst. No that's all right. - I'm such a bad host. - You're a good host, just-- - Just, just, just a minute. - You're a good hostess, don't worry. An upset hostess. - Yeah, a little bit. - That's for sure. Sorry about that. - Long day. I couldn't help but notice that you're not wearing a ring. Single? - Oh, uh, widower actually. - Oh I'm sorry. - No, it's... I'm sorry to hear that. - A couple years ago. - Yeah. - Boy here comes the water. Thank you, here let me get up. Hey Rach what's up? - Hey how you doing? - Good, what's up? - Yeah, yeah, I'm sitting here with Detective Ryker, from the Detroit Police Department. - Jesus fucking Christ, you're what? Jake, I'm gonna ask you something, and if you want to hang up after that, that's fine. Um, do you want to go to prison for the rest of your life? I'm not gonna go to prison for something I didn't do, and by god, not for something again. That shit's past man. I took a long look in the mirror and I'm, I'm set to change. If I get out of this mess. - That's exactly what I wanted to hear. So, why don't we go ahead and have him come meet you up at Brewster house? Aw man you told him where I'm at? Do you want to hide for the rest of your life? You're acting guilty, you're not guilty. All right. - So, go ahead and do this meeting. All right. - Yeah. - Eight a.m., I don't know, what do think, eight a.m. at Brewster house, how's that? Fine. - Can you uh, put Mr. Daniels into the wee back corner of your other place? - Aww, you told 'em I fucking drink too? Shit! - Jake, really? Yeah Jack, the liquor is done. JD's on that 24-hour vacation. - Perfect. - For now. - Perfect, thank you. - Thank you, good job Rachel. - Yeah, you think I would have put my brother on speaker if I was trying to protect him or if I thought he was going to incriminate himself or anything? - No, no, that's a good point. Hey you made good points for yourself and for him. And it could turn out to help him out a lot. I appreciate it, I appreciate the call, and um, I'll get up there bright and early, eight - All right. - O'clock tomorrow morning. So I'm gonna get out of here, okay? - All right. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - Yes, nice to meet you. - Is it all right if I set that down there? No. - Okay, don't get up. - Have a good night. - Okay Rachel, thank you. - Yeah, yeah. - I'll find my way out. - Ok, yeah thanks. - I gotta tell you Rachel, I mean I hope that you're right about this and that you're brother's innocent, but, you remember how I said that Crime Scene Magazine only does cases on closed, you know closed cases? - Right. - I just feel like this would make a really fantastic story. - I know, right? - Yes! - I'll make you a deal. - Okay. - If he is found innocent on this, we will write that story together. - Do you mean when he's found innocent? Touche, awww. Absolutely my fault. Oh, I know you probably need to get going too. - Oh I probably should it's late. - All right. * I can feel your hands all over me * Creating friction everywhere * As I slip into this dream of you * When I wait till you'll be there * You're the one that * Every time I close my eyes * I never sing about-- This just into the news room.

You can call me Jim. - Okay Jim, do you want to ask your questions out here, or do you want to go inside? - I wanna go inside, show me your hideout. Wow, no wonder you were able to evade the cops for so long. Who'd think to look for you in a place like this? Man this is old. - Do you wanna take a look around? - Yeah, that's why I'm here man. - Let's go on a tour, follow me. - A tour, okay, lead the way. - And uh, this is the kitchen. - Oh really, I would'a never figured that one out, you know, the frig and-- What's the matter Jake? No sense of humor? - Not right now no. - Fair enough, yeah, I'll give you that one. - You look pretty warm. - Yeah man. - We could either, ask the questions here or go outside on the patio, it's nice and cooler. - No, let's go out, looks like there's a breeze too. - There is. - Yeah let's... - Follow me. - Okay. Just out here. - Hello? Hello Rachel. - Who is this? It, it's John. - John, John who? John Leno. - Dad? Dad, really, this is yoU? Why are you. - Yes Rachel. I, I know it's been a really long time since we've spoken. But, I'm so concerned about you. News travels fast. E-Even as far as Toledo. I-I know Jake is considered a prime suspect in these-- - No Dad, no, no Dad listen! Jake, Jake is gonna be fine! We've re, we've reconnected and, I actually set him up with a detective this morning and they had a meeting, and while they had the meeting Jake said that the detective got called away, because there was another murder. Yes so I think Jake is gonna be in the clear, I really do! Oh just a minute, hey hey Dad, I'm getting another call. Um, I'm gonna call you right back, okay? Hey good morning Jim. Hey I already talked to-- - Rachel. Rachel. - I already talked to Jake. - Are you sitting down? - I, I, do I need to be? Yeah, I think so. - Well what's, what's wrong? - He's up to 10 now Rachel. Have you been watching the news, or listening to anything on the radio, or-- I'd, uh, I just totally avoid the news, just, it literally makes me sick to my stomach. Why do, Jim, Jim, you don't, you don't sound right. - I don't, I don't know how to tell you this, um... - Just, just just tell me Jim. - All right, yesterday... - Go ahead, just tell me. After uh... - Jim? - About an hour after we left your house, um, - Uh-hmm? - Rachel, um, Darcy Miller was number nine. - What, say that again, I don't... - He he, he killed Darcy Miller. What, oh...

Daddy please-- - Honey we're far apart. I please I just need you to come over. W-What's going on? He killed my friend Darcy. I need, I really need to see you Dad... C-Can we meet somewhere half-way? - Oh, well, I guess, I don't know what's half-way! Just a minute. - Find a place honey and I-I'll meet you there. - All right, just a minute. We're far apart. I, there's a, there's a place in, New Port I think, it's Kara's, can we do that? It's, it's a Greek restaurant. - Sure, sure honey, absolutely! - Okay. - When do you want to meet? - I don't know! Can I bring, can I bring the brothers, can I bring Danny and Jake? I think we all - Yeah. - Need to be together. Okay. - That'll be great if they can come. I haven't seen them in so long, sure honey. - Dad, ok? - Just let me know where. - I need to, I need to get myself together, can I call back, two, I don't, two o'clock? Absolutely honey, whenever you're ready. - Okay, okay I'll call them. Okay. - Okay, hey, I'll meet you at two then. - I, I really need you Dad! - Hey Sis what's up? What? Who got killed? Darcy Miller. - Darcy Miller? - Darcy, she was the reporter, she was here in my home when I tried to call you. That's the name that Ryker with me. Oh man, are you okay? I was with Dad on the phone when Ryker called me and I was, talking to Dad. - Oh fuck, Dad? You talked to Dad? Yes and he called me here. Rachel? - He, I don't know, I called him back, 'cause I'm so upset, I wanted to see him and he said he would see me so... And we're gonna meet. Can, can you come with me? - Oh, I don't know, I haven't seen him in so long, that I don't think that... He, he want, he wants, he wants to see you, he cares about you Jake! That's why he called me! - Of course he does, sure. I'll do it for you. - All right can I come, can I come get you like at 12:30? - 12:30's fine, I'll be ready. All right, just maintain, okay? All right. I love you. Bye bye. - Bye. - This is fucking surreal. - John Leno, am I right? Good to see you. - Hey Dad. So, how was your drive in, Dad? - Yeah. - Oh it was great, it's so good to see you again. - How long did it take? - Hello. - Oh hi. - Hi. - Welcome to Kara's. - Thank you. Thank you so much. - Here's your menu. I'll be right back. - Thank you. So, no traffic or anything? - No it was good. - That's good. - No construction. Well you kids look great. - Thank you. - Even you Jake. - Gee thanks Dad. - So where's Daniel? You know, I tried to get Danny to come, but you know him tied up at home, the family man, the provider-- - The good son. - You know, don't even start that Jake, just... - Let him go Rachel, he's right. I was never there for him like I was for you occasionally, or your little brother. I deserve whatever digs I get. - You know, I was always the example, as mother used to say. A bad example. - Right. - I was Dad, was. Always had a chip on my shoulder, and god only knows how many bottles of booze. I smacked my wives around. I'd hit them, and I'd say, and I'd yell and say, be happy Welt Belt you fucking bitch. It's true, it's true! Rachel don't shush him, let him go, it'll help to hear what he has to say. Go on son, please. - I, I'm a bad person. Horrible. I know that. Rach, when I told you if I got into a giant mess, I would change my ways? Well, this morning after the killings, it looks like I'm off the police radar. After Jim, Detective Ryker left, I had this like, religious experience. I stopped drinking. I did. Just like that, just stopped. Now I, I feel like I want to yell to the world and say, that the asshole known as Jake Leno is gone, forever, forever. - I am, so proud of you Jake. I mean, you sound like a different person. - I hope so. - Look at me, I mean, you, are a different person. - I hope so. - Son you figured life out. Only wish I hadn't skipped out on you kids, but I... - Dad, Dad, don't blame yourself one ounce for that beast you were married to, not one ounce! How you were married to that, excuse of a human being I'll never know! You both gotta believe me,, that woman tore my insides apart every day. When I would come home from work and I would see my children all welted up like you were, it made me sick to my stomach. But what did I do? I waited till my kids turned 18 and ran out of town like a pitiful coward. - I, I'm sorry Dad but, I hated you for the longest time because of that! You know, and I, you know, I knew inside that you know, she was destroying you. Well I get it, now. - You know what guys? We can't take those years back, they're gone forever. - I know it. - We can move forward. - Right. - Starting now. - Right. - At this lunch. - Right. - Today. - A new Jake. - A new all of us! - Right. Here's to beginnings! - Right, you know what, I agree. - In a way, I gotta admit, I'm sort of glad your brother isn't here right now. Part of what I wanted to talk to you about is concerning Daniel. - Danny? - What about Danny, Dad? - Well I don't know if it's a good idea to talk about it without him being here. - Let me grab these. Why not? - Well, maybe I can get your opinions, before I talk to him. - Sure, sure. Tell us, we'd be happy to, right Rach? - Yeah, go ahead, what is it, Dad? - Well, it's a long time in coming, this news, and I'm gonna take a wild guess that both of you may have suspected this for a long time now, but, Daniel was adopted. - What? - Like adopted? - Are you shitting me? Danny boy is adopted? - Yes. - After all those years and we teased him for not looking like us, or acting like us? - No, I am, totally speechless right now. - Me too. - I mean, was I adopted too Dad, because let me tell you, I would be for real to know I'm not related to that bitch, and have her blood running through me, that's for sure. You weren't Rachel. I knew I shouldn't have said anything, I shouldn't have spoke up. Once again I have to ask for your forgiveness. - Well, now we know, but the question is, are you gonna tell Danny or are you gonna let it slide again? - Right. - I don't know, I, I'll give him a call later on, if I don't chicken out as usual. - You can do it. - Come on Dad you can do it. All right, eats. Got the gyro. - Mmm, looks good, thank you. - Thank you so much. - Enjoy. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Well, dig in guys. - Well, I want some of that. Can I taste some of that? Mmm, good, huh. That's right you don't like tomatoes. No I don't. - They're good for 'ya. - Hey, don't be so pissed at me. I thought I had a really hot lead. Turned out my source was full of shit! - Oh, yeah that's never happened before. - No she seemed like such a nice crack whore. - Listen, we don't... We don't nab this motherfucker soon, the next meeting we're gonna have on a park bench, is gonna be on the grounds of some, sunrise living assisted facility, if we remember where the fuck it is! And I'm being serious, they're gonna put us out to pasture. Both of us. Both of us! You want to know how serious Rachel is about making sure that her brother is absolved of all this? - Sure. - All right. She said to me, you got no clues, all right? All you got is a guy walking around with a ski mask in a trench coat, and he's attacking hookers, and topless dancers-- Oof! - Whoa! - What the fuck? - You okay? - Oh my god I'm so-- - Hey, Jimmy, Jimmy! - Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, do not shoot me! - Easy now partner! - All right all right calm down, I'm not-- - It was just an accident! - All right all right all right I'm not gonna shoot you, it's just, you just nailed me with that damn ball, and I didn't, I did, anything I did, all right, relax, calm down, calm down, calm down. - We were just kicking it around a little, me and my daughter-- - Okay, okay, - It got over my head-- - okay okay okay okay, relax, relax, relax, relax, relax, it's okay, that's ok. - It was all my fault, I just, do you need some ice? - I don't know, how do you treat a smash to the old coconut anyway? - Old coconut? Daughter? - Uh-hmm, we're so sorry. - She looks more like your sister to me. Uh, anyway, uh, I'll be okay, I'm fine, I'm fine just, do me a favor. Okay? Take that ball, - Uh-huh. - And play somewhere else, okay, like like, 150 miles in that direction please? - You got it, you got it. - You got it. - Thank you, thank you very much, okay, yes. - Whoa, dude, are you okay? - Whoo, man! Yeah, I got pounded man, I lost my. Anyway, anyway. - So, - Hmm, any bruise right there? - No, you're gonna be okay. - I'm gonna live? Whoo! - Ah, so, uh, you were saying, about Rachel Leno's idea? - Umm, yeah, Rachel has a, oh yeah yeah, so she says, "You guys got nothing, no leads." - No fake right. - No shit Sherlock. You know, but she said to me, "Why don't you, "lure the killer into his next victim?" - Like a sting operation. - Set up a sting operation, that's exactly what she said. - What did you say to that? - Well, first I asked if she watched a lot of cop shows on TV, right? I mean, but she got pissed! She said, "Well, you would've asked me that "if you didn't think it was a good idea." And I said, "Okay, yeah you know, I got to hand it to you." It makes sense, right? So, I said my partner and I, we're gonna get one of our, women of the night, - Okay. - One that owes us a favor, for keeping her trick-turning ass out of jail, - All right. - And, and we'll, we'll get 'em to do the job. - Smart move. - Yeah yeah. - Well, who we gonna lay it on? Eight-Mile Trish? - That's who exactly that I was thinking, right? - Yeah? - So I said to her, yeah yeah, but I said, "Ok we've got just the person," she says, "Wait a minute." She said "No no no no no, you know how badly "I want Jake, eliminated from any suspicion in this case." - Yeah of course, that's her brother right? - That's her brother yeah, - Okay. - Yeah I do. So, she says, get this, "Let me be the lure. "Let me dress up and be the lure." And I said, "I can't let a layperson involved in a "homicide investigation, especially if it "brings them into harms way." I said "No no, forget it." - Of course you did, - Of course I did. - Yeah yeah. - Yeah of course I'm sorry. - What did you think I said? - I'm just so sick and tired of us being on the wrong side of the tracks on this case. - Yeah yeah yeah. - But you're exactly right. - I mean we need a break on this case. I'm starting to think maybe, just maybe, Eight-Mile Trish is our answer. - Yeah, all right, so this is what I'm gonna do. All right, first of all, I think I'm gonna give Rachel a call. - Okay. - Um, I'm the one that had to deliver the news about Darcy Miller's death. - Aw, jeez... - Yeah, yeah so, I'm gonna, I'm gonna give her a call, just tell her I appreciate it, maybe she could, she'd like some good news. - All right bud. Hey, Jimmy! Hello Chief! - Talk to me Bolden! What's going on? - Uh, well, not much, we're setting here talking over a couple of things, uh, you want to speak to Ryker? In a minute, I want to hear a few things from you first, without you having the benefit of receiving coaching from your mentor, understand? - Yes, I understand. - Where are we with this investigation, Al? You guys got to give me something. I've got city officials breathing down my neck to get a break in this case. I mean I thought I had my two best detectives on this job but hey, I can always reassign you two. - Well uh, we have a couple of angles we're looking at, in more detail-- - I don't think you realize the gravity of what we're dealing with here. There's a psychopath out there, in our community. And we need answers, and we need 'em now, or the state of unrest throughout this city is going to reach a fever pitch. - You know uh, Jimmy and I were saying that exact same thing, and believe me, we do understand the gravity of the situation! - Speaking of the old vet, put him on, now. - Hey Laura what's up? - Ryker! At least give me the courtesy of referring to me as Chief Edmunds when your partner's in ear shot! You don't respect me, I get that, I'd be plenty pissed too if I was the man who was passed over for the Police Chief position by a woman but you're just gonna have to get over it! - All right, uh, what can I do for you, Chief? - For starters you and your sidekick can find this insane killer before we lose authority in this case! - What, are you saying-- - That is exactly what I'm saying, Jimmy, the FBI is all over me now! I mean it's the same old what's the matter with Detroit? You guys can't find a Macy's Day parade float in a haystack let alone a needle, crap! - Not funny, not funny at all! - I'm not making this up Ryker! Those aren't my words! - Whose words are they then? - That is totally irrelevant right now! Besides, do you think they're wrong? - No. Look, we're working on something, we'll give 'em a little something to chew on in a little bit, okay? Just, work with us. Here, let me put, let me put Al on for 'ya. - Al, all right, give me what you got. What clue to chew on is Ryker talking about? - Well, we got this really hot lead, but we need to verify that our source is 100 % reliable before we let the media in on it, and uh-- - Just what I thought, you got nothing, Al, give me back to Ryker, now! - Detective Ryker, how may I help you? - Jim you listen to me, I am trying to keep your reputation intact, but at some point I'm not gonna be able to keep the wolves away from this door! Make something happen! Find that haystack needle, without sitting on it and putting a hole in your old cop ass to match the other two in your right side! - Who told you that story, Laura, uh, I mean Chief? - Uh, you did Jimmy! Are you starting to lose it Detective? - No, I'm not. We're not, we'll be all right, look, just give us a little more time, we'll, we'll have something for you, okay? All right? - Jimmy you dick! Dick. I'm a dick? You answer your phone? We're having a conversation? I'm a dick. Right. We're here. Daddy! Daddy! - Look they're outside playing. Hey, hey slow down! Girls, what have I told you about undoing your seatbelt before I stop the car? Slow down! - Sorry! - We've gotta take it inside anyway, okay kids? Come on. - Hey, what about me? - Come on, it's not your play date! We'll go play at your house. - Well, thanks a lot Doreen. I'll be back around nine o'clock, is that okay? - No problem Danny. You know the kids, they get along great. You know me, there won't be any filet mignon for dinner, at least not for tonight. Okay, you're the best! - Thanks. - Thank you! See you. - Jeff, always good to see you. - You too. There you go. I know it's three dollars, you keep the difference. Buy yourself a couple six packs or something. - Thanks man. - But Andy! - Yeah. - Make sure you get 'em at Meijer, like 500 % cheaper. - No shit, thanks brother. Hey Jeff, how are you? - I'm good, how's it going tonight? Good,. - I'll get you. I gotta that outfit. You look a little empty for someone. - Flattery will get you anything. - Anything?

Oh yeah, um, who's working the bar tonight, Eddie? - Yep, Eddie's on now. - Here, do me a favor, give him this. Tell him it's from a secret admirer. - No problem! Hey Eddie! That guy over there said to give you this! He said he admires your secrets. - No he didn't, he said to tell me I have a secret admirer. - Oh! - You never met Jeff, huh? - Uh-uh. Well I bet you won't get your hauling beverages to other customers again. He took great care of you too, didn't he? - Hell yeah he did! He gave me $50 on a $6 tab and said keep the change! Oh, that's like, what, almost a 40 % tip right? - Yeah, 40 % exactly. Idiots, I'm surrounded by idiots. - What's wrong? You running from the feds or something? - Ha ha, very funny.

You just raised the bar for getting anything you want out of me kiddo! I get off at seven. And my kids, they're with my mom tonight. If you want, you could have much more fun. - Well, I'm married. - So? You want to bring your wife? I'm game for that! - You're funny, I tell you what, are you hungry? - Shit yeah I'm hungry! I mean I burn a ton of calories dry humping you guys all day! - Okay, I'll tell you what. I got to go pick up some stuff, but I'll be back at seven on the nose, and I'll take you someplace nice, for a good dinner. - And that's it, really? - Yeah that's it, really. - Thank you for agreeing to see me on such short notice. I'm sorry about Darcy. I can't believe she's gone, she... - Okay, I'm so sorry. - I should have made her come back to the house, I don't come back to the house. - Don't take any blame for it, it's not your fault. It's not. Listen, I'll tell you something a little on a higher note, okay, all right, all right? Talked to my partner about your idea to, lure the killer into his next victim. He thought it was brilliant. - I don't think you came over here just to tell me about my idea being great, am I right? - Mm, yeah. Maybe not, um... I gotta level with you, this whole notion, to get a layperson involved in a police investigation, it's totally against all police protocol, okay? You understand that the right? - Yeah. - All right so, I talked to Al, he thought it was a great idea, right? We figured we'll get one of our street girls to just pull it off, she'll be the lure. - What? - We'll give her $100 and-- - No no, no hey, you said - No let me explain! - That I could be the bait, that was the whole point! - I know but-- - I'm helping, I'm helping Jake, and you said it was okay with it! - Yeah but - So, you're going back on your word? Wow. - Listen listen listen listen, I said it was a great idea didn't I? - Yes! - Okay but I also said that you got to admit this, I also said it's crazy that you even thought of it, did I not do that? - Yeah, yeah you did. - Did I not say that? - You're a good cop! - Okay. - Is that what you want me to say? - No, no no that's not it at all, I just... I don't want you to be in danger. Get that? - Yeah, know what, I do. Jim Ryker sir, I'm a big girl. - Ah, yeah yeah you're huge. Maybe about five-two. - You know what I mean! You teach me how to be a prostitute and I will be the best prostitute that you've ever seen! Yeah. - Yeah you, you ought to know by now I'm willing to do anything it takes to get this guy! He killed Darcy! Enough is enough, just teach me! - All right. Just let me give it a minutes time okay? - What's there to think about? - Well, what's there to think about? Regulations, policy, practices, the law. I, I gotta be out of my mind to even consider letting you do this. - Can this? - All right, all right. I'll let you do it. Listen to me, listen to me-- - You won't, you won't be disappointed, I promise, I can do this! - I'm not worried about that, you're not gonna disappoint me because I'm gonna train you, but I-I, you gotta swear to me, swear to me, look at me, swear to me, nobody, nobody finds out about this, - No. - Especially not my partner. Bolden finds out about this, I am royally screwed, you got that? - How, it'll be our forever secret, I mean, who am I gonna tell? - Look. - Really. - Well exactly, nobody. - Well I know, that's what I'm saying, but, I was thinking, I don't know if I thought this through really well. - Uh-huh, getting second thoughts, okay never mind, forget it. - No, no, it's not second thoughts, it's that, they're strippers, they're prostitutes, they're just young women, - Yeah the victims, yeah yeah so? - Well... - What about it? Am I gonna be a, who's gonna pull over if it's me standing out on the curb? - What, what? - I mean we need to get this guy to be, really think that way. - Wait, wait, just listen. When you look in the mirror-- - I did and this is the point. Do you not understand what I'm saying? - You gonna let me, you gonna let me finish? Let me finish for a second, okay Rach? If you don't see, when you look in the mirror, what I see, you're trembling. - Yeah I know because it, you don't get it. - Yes I do get it, - This is, this is very, - I do get it, and you're - this is very-- - gonna get it, many times as a hooker. That's a joke. - I know. - All right listen, when you look in the mirror if you don't see what I and every other man on this planet sees, and that is a beautiful, you said you were gonna let me finish. - Okay. - That's a beautiful, sexy, alluring, attractive, what else can I-- - But she has, but she has to pass as a hooker that someone's gonna pull over for. - Well that's my job, okay? You have to trust me, that I can teach you how to do this. - Oh, and then can you like, change, my whole configuration? - Really? - Yes. You know what? - You-- - I'm gonna have to dress like a nothing. - What? - No one wants to see that seriously. - I'm gonna teach you how to do that, okay? - Okay. - All right.

Okay well, I just had an idea, that you might not, because you're so straight laced, and you're this, - Oh I got a hooker - realistic-- - drawer maybe. - Yeah you have a hooker drawer? All right, well go get your stuff then. No you're, okay. I kind of thought I had a, and I went to a thrift shop, um, I think it was called Hookers Are Us or something like that, , okay and, actually picked out some things for you to try on, I think I have the size, you're like minnow, right, tiny size right? All right listen, listen. - Is that hooker. - I just so happen to have brought it in my truck, okay? I'm gonna go out and get it, all right, and you're gonna do a little fashion show for me.

So, it's still this summer where I'm taking you. I'm taking you to Aruba. - What, really? No, I'm taking you to dinner. I got you back though, didn't I? - Yeah, whatever. What have you got? Are you serious? Get in here. - I can't even get past you. Oh... - Get in there. - How many steps, I forgot? All right, where we going with this? - If you expect me to try on everything in this box, you're taking it upstairs. There's not that much in here, but you know what, what is that, your bedroom's up there? - Yeah. - Uh, how many steps are there? - Enough. - Ugh, figures. I can't just open it , down there? - No! - All right, fine. This where, this is where you're trying the stuff on? - Yes! - Well get up here then. Show me the way. - I'm coming, I'm coming. I don't know how many outfits they have at the hooker place. - I... I bought 'em out, yes. - Ah, uh-hmm, excuse me. Where'd that towel come from? Yeah, let's see the outfit. Jesus. Hmm. Whoa, you know? - Too much. - That... Come on, turn around a little bit. - No. - Well then, turn around a little bit. I'm gonna see you go back up the stairs. Um, I'd like to see that without the hose. You know, all right, try something else. Take much longer I'm gonna be done eating all your bagels. Good thing you're eating bagels, I can't eat 'em for breakfast. You fell asleep, really? - Uh well... Try to make a combination of all of this stuff that we liked, okay? 'Cause I'm getting ready to crash, all right? - You don't like-- - One more, one more, just, please, one more, try. Let's just-- - This is the last, this is the last chance. - All right. - Drool, really? Hey hey! What do you think? - Perfect! It's perfect! - All right, I'm ready to go. Tomorrow, let's go tomorrow. - You have the boots too, yeah. - I'm ready! - You're ready. - Yes! - Uh-uh, not so fast. Lookit-- - I'm not trying to-- - Lookit lookit lookit, all the outfits you tried on? - Uh-hmm. - That's perfect. - All right, I know, I -- - Okay, but but, there's still some work to do. Okay I want to make sure, 1000 % sure that you're ready for this. - All right. - I don't want anything to come up that catches you by surprise. Got a little homework to do on your vocabularies, your manners, your walk's pretty good I like that. All right we're close. - Is that the right amount? Is that nice? - What? - Gutter mouth? - Gutter mouth, you got it. - All right. - Okay, you want to stay there for a while. - Well if you want. - No no, go go... Oh, oh man, look what I did to your couch. You're gonna need some ice huh? - Yeah. I was out cold huh? - Yeah. - Cold like it's right up my ass, glass. - Doreen, I'm sorry I'm late, I ended up having to go across town, pick up some stuff for the nursery, time just got away from me. Were the kids good for you? - They were awesome, always are, no sweat. I can round them up, but, talk about sweat, look at you. What is with the trench coat? Check your calendar, you're dripping, soaking wet. - I know. - It's the middle of summer. It doesn't even snow in Michigan in the middle of a summer. - No wonder I'm sweating bullets, I always put this on when I'm moving stuff around the nursery. I know, what was I thinking. Are the kids ready? - They are ready, they're in the basement playing, I'll go round 'em up, okay? - Thank you. - I'll meet you out front, ok. Good to see you again. - Thanks Saleem, the meal was wonderful as always, now give our best to Mark, I hope he feels better. - Sure I'll do it. * I got plenty of nothing * And nothing's plenty Have a wonderful evening. Thank you. - Please Gail do it again, it is by far your best impression, it cracks me up every time! - Okay, but if I get arrested, you're bailing me out of jail, tonight! - Come on very funny just do it! I mean, nobody does a fall-down drunk guy as good as you! I mean, how can you not do it after a compliment like that? - All right, but you know the rule. You got to stay here until I hit the ground, got it? - I got it, yeah yeah, my role's really small. - Um okay. * I've got plenty of nothing * But nothing, nuth, nu * Uh plenty for me. Ooh! - What the fuck you think you're doing man? I should fucking kill you, I ought to kill you right here on the spot! - Please, please don't kill me! I, I was just kidding around, I wasn't really going to hurt her! Did I hurt you ma'am? - Are you out of your mind? You scared me so bad I... No you didn't hurt me but, but how were you expecting this to end for god's sake? - Jesus honey just call 911. - Oh please, please don't do that! I'll do whatever you want! I'll mow your lawn, or wash your cars, forever! - Yeah like we're gonna tell you where we live! Gail what should we do babe? - First of all everyone calm down a bit! Kid, especially you. Take a few deep breaths. Why, why did you do that to me? - Stupid... I don't know, no one ever caught that guy Killing people and all! I don't know, I thought it'd be cool you know, to dress up in this stupid coat, and mask, and just try to scare someone half to death. I was never gonna hurt you, before, he tackled me I was gonna pull off my mask and yell punked! - You're just, that's the most lamest, stupid thing I have ever heard. Hey, wait a sec, what's your name? - It's Corey, Miss. - Corey what? - Oh, I'd rather not say, 'cause my dad would kill me if this hits the news, 'cause he's like-- - Oh let me guess. Your father's a politician, that right? - Um, no not exactly, but, everyone in town knows him, and I'm only 14, man he'd kill me if I went to jail! - I'll kill you, what's your god damn full name? - Barry, you calm down too please. Last chance or we call the cops right this second! - I, it's Corey, Carver sir. - As in the steak houses Carver? - Yes sir, that's the one. - So you thought it'd be fun just to scare the shit out of a woman eh? How come you didn't try me on for size? - Well, I never saw you! If I did I would have never tried it on you! Your, your girl... - Our relationship means nothing to you, silver spoon entitled little shit! Why aren't you at home playing video games anyway? - Like those are better, please Barry. - How'd you get here anyway? If you tell me you got your own car, I'll beat the shit out of you-- - He said he's 14. - I, I rode my bike, it's right over there! Please, just let me go, please! - Don't move! I say we call the cops. You tell him. - So do you think you learned a lesson here, or do you think you'd learn better if we called the cops? - I wouldn't ask, please, I can hardly breath! I know so just-- - Go! - Excuse me? - That means get the hell out of here before we change our minds, Corey Carver! - Oh, oh thanks, thank you! I'm sorry again! I'll never do this again! I, I think I actually will, you know, go home, play with my PS4. You guys want to come? I'm sorry, I'm just kidding around. At least it's not scaring, huh? Thank you, okay, oh jeez... - This world is a mess. What's this guy, what, what if he was an adult? What if he was the real guy that's going around terrorizing the entire State of Michigan? First of all, you'd be dead, and probably so would I! I wonder how many other copycats are out there? No wonder the bodies are adding up, Jesus! - Barry, I just realized, you, you, no idea what you're getting yourself into, and, and you just tackled him, and... You-you literally saved my life tonight! - Never, never would I hesitate to protect you! - Hey! - Hey. - Can we talk for a bit? - Sure! - Were you serious when you said you were interested in my business idea? - Yeah, of course I was. - You want to go eat something or? - No I had all that pizza earlier. Didn't you get any? - Uh, I totally forgot. Lost my head there for a second. I'll just hang out here for a bit then. - I'm cool with that. - How many times have we talked about girls that we know who've been victims of physical abuse? - Tons, like, practically every day. - Exactly, and you and I both know first-hand what that horror looks like. And I want to do something to make it stop. - But, like what Faith? - I don't know like, open a shelter, or start a place where we can teach women how to avoid becoming victims, not any kind of victim. Not a victim of spousal abuse, or a jealous boyfriend, husband, not having to deal with mental torment, or living with a mean alky, none of that. - I mean, I hear you, I just, I don't really know what I could do to help, you know, it's not like I really have a mind for business. You know, but hey, maybe I could talk to teenage girls, you know, the ones right out of high school. - Uh-huh, yeah, that'd be perfect Hope and-- - And I have an idea! I think it's good. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Let's hear it. - If we're gonna go in on this together, why don't we call it Faith, Hope, and Charity? - Oh my god! Faith, Hope and Charity, that's frikkin' brilliant! That's it, that's what we're calling it for sure! And you know, maybe we can stop stripping for a living. - Ah, that's totally the idea. - Wouldn't that be sweet. - I'm so sick of doing this! But you gotta admit, where else can you walk out of a job on a Thursday night with over 1000 bucks in your pocket. I'm sick of it but, it might just be the seed money we need for Faith, Hope and Charity. - You really like that don't you? - Heck yeah, and speaking of cash, who cares if strange guys I'm never gonna see again think all I am is tits and ass without any class. It makes me all the more proud that I just extract half their weekly paycheck out of their wallet. Those guys are like free ATMs. - You're so funny. But, you're right you know. And you, are always walking out of here with the most money at the end of the night. Maybe it's because you come off so confident. I wish, I could be more like that, I, always sound really pathetic and I'm like, do you want another dance? - Ah my girl, you're a pisser. Well let's get out of here. - Um, actually, I have to run to the bathroom real quick. - Well that's cool, I can wait. - You know what, I'm gonna be a few minutes. - Ah. - All that pizza, so... - All right, see you tomorrow night Hope. Bye! - Hey partner. No no, that's all right, I had to... Yeah. Oh no, really? Where? Yeah I know it. Treasure Testing something like that. Yeah. Uh-hmm, yeah yeah okay. Yeah I'm on my way. - That your troubled partner? - Yeah, that's my partner, my long-time partner. You got a problem with that? - Yeah I do, I got a big problem with that. - Oh yeah, well what would that be? - How long has this joker been on a killing spree? - Oh I don't know, about three, four... - That's just it, you don't know, you don't know jack shit. You got a trench coat and a ski mask. Other than that you don't know anything about this mother fucker. Or than the fact that he's using piano wire tied to wooden handles to behead his victims, you've got nothing. Stop me when I'm saying something other than the facts, Bolden. - Wooden handles, oh. Look, we're doing our best here. Maybe that's why you guys get the big bucks, huh? So how long you been with the bureau? - 11 years, nine months, and four days. - Yeah but who's counting, right? - Yeah who's counting, right. You fix the time of death on this one? - I'll give you an exact time-- I'll give you an exact time when we get her back down to the morgue. But for now, judging by the stage of rigor mortis, I'd put it real close to four, six hours tops. - That makes sense. Club closes around two a.m., this poor girl is probably the last dancer to leave. - Yeah. - Son of a bitch knows his way around these joints. And so far he's been able to stay one step ahead of the local efforts. - Well you could add this to the mix if you like. The angle isn't nearly severe, as the previous victims. - And, and what does that tell you? - It leads me to believe that this is the same assailant that garroted the heads of the other women I examined, and uh, I'm assuming you're gonna be the one making that determination. - Well of course. But tell me how you came up with that? - The closer to level the angle, from the throat to the back of the neck, the closer the height of the person wielding the device is to the victim's height. In this case, she was five foot eight. Note the angle. The other victims were between five-four, and five-six, again, note the angle. It's simple math. All the angles are consistent with the killer's height. The angle here showed that the killer is approximately two inches taller than this victim. Therefor he, or she, stands at five foot, 10 inches. - Definitely adds up, thank you. - Ah, I'm just doing my job. - Aw, Jesus Al. Another one? Oh, who is this? - Special Agent Sam Warden. - Well it looks like we hit the big time, huh? Feds are back in town. - Not a very glorious distinction Ryker. Not like you're hosting another Superbowl or anything. It's more like again. - What's that supposed to mean? - Truly it means that neither one of you two knew that the victim was linked to the sexual misconduct trial of Congressman Waiverly. And you, you and your partner-- Hey, wait wait wait wait, my partner has a name, okay? It's Al Bolden and he and I have been partners long before you became a federale, okay Mr. Bigshot? And I'm not talking about Chauncey Billups either. He doesn't get that reference, obviously. - Relax, Ryker. - Because he's not a Detroiter. - As I was saying, because this involves a congressman, you are both officially off this case, effective immediately. - Wait wait what, what? - Off the case! English not your first language James? I also speak fluent Spanish or German, if that will help. Oh really you sarcastic! - Relax, relax, he's right you know, come on, come on, we don't have shit to go on! Okay, that killer is still at large and in charge. Look, we don't even come close to the resources the feds have. Just let it go! - Let it go, just like that? Let it go? - We don't have any choice! - You wanna let it go! - Jimmy! Come on, this is one time when we're gonna have to turn this over to the A-Team. - Ah, Jesus. - Look I'm sorry, don't take it personal, I know I sure as hell don't. - Stay back sir! What a mess eh? - What a mess. How do you get these fucking gloves on? You laugh, prick. This is his first time? - No, well I'm usually the one to-- - You know he's pushing his luck, he's pushing his luck. Oh. Is your boy all right. Oh jeez. Fucking, what a pussy. Big tough Detroit guy. I'll be all right. Big tough Detroit cop. - Yeah I'll be all right, oh shit fuck, man. Fuck, I don't even feel bad for him. What a-- - Look, I swear to you we're gonna catch this sick fucker. - Yeah, yeah. - Right? Look. I'm gonna get out of here man. - All right. - Maybe now this motherfucker'll will meet his match yet. - Yeah ... - Hey I'm sorry. - All right. - Oh, shit, unbelievable. - I'm sorry for Ryker, he's got a personal stake in this. One of his lady friends fell victim to that son of a bitch. - Wow, that explains his jumpy attitude. Things are a hell of a lot different when it gets personal, man I've been there before. - Yeah. - You know um, you talk to him, you let him know I'm sorry for his loss. - Okay. - And Al, we're gonna nail this five-ten piece of shit to the wall. - How do you know he's five-ten? - Just doing my job. Nice, just catch this fucker, will you? Promise me. - We will, do me a favor. Why don't you get on out of here too, no need to watch more blood soak through that bag. - Okay. Call Rachel Leno. Come on. Calling Rachel Leno, mobile, press the phone hangup button to end the call. - Yeah yeah yeah, I know, I know, I know the rules already Siri, every time. Come on, come on. Hey Jim, how's it going? - Hey, hey, Rachel, Rachel, we're going tonight. - Yeah. - We're going tonight. Listen, if you have any, any qualms about it, let me know now I'll be thank-- - Listen, hey, I'm your lure dammit, we're gonna do this! I'm ready. - Are you home? - I am. - All right, listen-- - I'm about to leave. - What? What, I'm about to leave but, yeah, tell me what's up? - Listen, b-but we gotta go tonight, I'm, I'm 20 minutes away from you, I'm by the airport. Can you, can you cancel the appointment? - That's fine yes, I will cancel, this is more important, gosh yes. - Okay all right, I'll be there in less than 20 minutes, all right? - All right, sounds good, drive safely please. - I will, we're going tonight kid. - Uh huh. - All right, see you soon. - All right, bye. Tigers are going to the World Series! Yeah right. God, hell of a time you pick to have the gate locked. - I'm sorry. - Jesus Christ I'm... Jimmy where are you going? - Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm so, so hyped up, I'm sorry. - Well you can sit down, right here, sit. - I got here fast, right? - Yes, closer. - Listen Rachel, we gotta go tonight. I'm not gonna lie to you, what we're doing, what I'm doing, is totally interfering with the law. Wait, look, you are the law. - Yeah yeah, we, uh yeah, I am the law, yeah yeah. - Then how, how are you interfering? That doesn't make any sense. - It's not, not about our plan. Look, we were taken off the case today. - What? - You watch the news, or hear any of the report? - No, what? - He killed another dancer, late last night, early this morning. - What? - Yeah I was, I was called down to the crime scene by my partner, Bolden, and uh, - What is it? - I saw her headless body, Rachel, and uh, I just, I puked my guts up. - Oh. - All over the alley and, I haven't done that in 39 years on the force. I, I don't know, I'm losing it or, I'm getting too old for this shit I think. You know, I just... - But hey Jimmy wait, Jimmy what? Jimmy wait hey, they can't take you off the case just because you're human and puked, I mean, that doesn't sound right. - No no no no no, that's not why, that's not why, the FBI's involved, okay? When they say you're off the case, you're off the case. You got no choice, it's just, - Well, I don't, - it's as simple as that. - Why don't we just let them handle it? You know, then we don't have to do this whole, charade thing here. - Rachel, I have a strong feeling that I understand this killer's line of thinking. It's just, it's starting to make sense to me. Think about it, he's got this pattern that he's on. He's only killing prostitutes and strippers and-- - Well but, Darcy wasn't either of those, why would he kill Darcy? - Okay, that's true, and Bolden and I were talking about that, Bolden my partner, and, we're figuring maybe he's just changing his MO up a little bit to put us off track. - Okay yeah. - Okay, does that make sense? - Uh huh, uh huh. I, I, I'm telling you, I've got a line on him, I know exactly, I think I know exactly where he's going next, and I think he's gonna go, you know, he goes country, urban, country, not country like hyuck hyuck, but you know, just away from the city. He's due to hit tonight again, I know it! Look, if you don't want to do this, I totally understand. I'm gonna-- - Hey hey hey, no, I'm all in on this, we spent too much time on this, it's just, I don't want you getting in trouble. - You're worried about me? - Yes. - Listen, people have a way of turning a blind eye when the bad guy goes down, you understand? - Yeah, I know what you mean. - That's a chance that I'm gonna take, and it's not gonna be a chance for you, because if push comes to shove, I'm just gonna say I duped you into it or conned you, or some other, whatever. - And I'm just gonna act like I never, heard any of that crap? - What crap? Look, I just want to make sure that you are perfectly prepared, I don't want any scenarios coming up that's gonna, I don't know, put you in harms way. Remember, I promised you with my life that no harm would come to you. - You did. - And I'm not gonna let any harm come to you. - Thank you, thank you Jim. - So, very frankly, I have to tell you, you could use a little more hooker helper. - Seriously? - Yes. - Well, give it to me teach, serve me up a heaping portion, Another, another lesson, ok. This is what I was gonna do first okay? - All right. I was gonna put a wire on you. Just run a wire, just - Okay. Like up through the back or whatever, okay? - All right. - And, then I got to thinking, if he detects it, I may not get to you in time to come to your aid and-- - Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, from where I'm sitting that is not a good idea, let's, n-no wire. - Okay, okay, no wire. - No wire. - So, here's my other idea. And you gotta forgive me for pacing, but I'm just like, I'm just, - I get it. I'm antsy, okay? So, this is what we're gonna do. We're gonna get, I'm gonna get, a few girls and we're going to - Whoa! - Drop them off where I think-- - No no stop! What do you mean, girls? This is supposed to be my solo performance. - Yeah yeah yeah. - Hannah, Hooker Hannah, this is my time. - Yeah yeah yeah yeah, it's - What are you talking about? - Your time, it's your time. All right, it's gonna be your time, okay, I promise, just, just hear me out for a second okay? - Okay okay, okay. - All right. I'm going to get three other hookers, so there'll be four total, you count, you're my main hooker, okay? - Okay, okay. - We're gonna get them to, to, drop them off at the same, the same spot, - Uh-hmm. - And eventually they're gonna dwindle down just to you. Let me explain a little bit about how prostitutes work, ok? - Okay. - They're, prostitutes are a lot like, like piranhas, - Right, 'cause they, chew men, take big bites out of 'em? - No no, - What is it? - Yeah and that's a good one though no, no. Because they travel in packs, okay? I would say they travel in schools, but I don't want to insult piranhas, 'cause they're a lot smarter than most of the hookers I've met. - Oh well ha ha ha, very funny, I like the little fish story. - Thank you. - I'm not a cop, but, this whole thing is, are you overthinking it a little bit? - Why do you say that? - It kind'a sounds like you're maybe trying to protect me. Because if that's the case Jim, I am psyched for this! Real, I haven't even slept since we first even brought this up, and I'm, I've been prancing around my house like Sally Strumpet. Shades up, I'm-- - Shades up? I guess, I... I'm right, I can do this Jim, I really, I can. - You, you just amaze me Miss Leno. You truly do, and yes, that's mostly why I was concerned. I was, wanting to - I, I thought so. Make sure you were protected. All right, so uh, we'll just go with plan A then. - Yeah, yep. - Okay, sounds good. - Lets, lets, I'm all brushed up on all my expressions. - Yeah you sure are. - And I can, I can guarantee that he'll think he picked up the hookeriest hooker that ever walked the seediest sidewalk in the deep. - All right. - Right. - I like that. - I don't, there's one, one thing that's been kind of bugging me. - And, what's that? How am I gonna know if it's the real killer? I mean his car's-- - All right no, that's, that's, that's a good question. Look inside, and look for a trench coat. If the dude's wearing a trench coat, that's more than likely our guy, 'cause he's the only psycho that's gonna be wearing a trench coat in the middle of the summer. - But what if he only wears a trench coat when he kills them-- - Rachel, Rachel, Rachel! You're getting cold feet, no no, I can tell, I can tell. You can't afford to do that, you can't act scared. If you act scared, this could all turn out really badly. I'm not scared because I'm prepared, I just asked a simple question. It just, it seemed logical - All right all right, - to me. - Then, okay, then let's do this, just be an observant little hooker. - All right. - Every time a car pulls by, and there will be a lot 'cause you're gonna look hot, every time a car pulls by look inside, look in the back seat, look on the instrument panel, to see if there's anything, it could be either a switchblade, I mean - Right. - Just keep your eyes open, it's, it's, you've got to be aware of your environment. That's prostitution 101 honey. - All right, I knew that. - Just know where you're at. - Speaking of being observant, - Hmm? - Yesterday when you were at my house you said something like, I must be out of my ever-loving mind to be having me do this, you remember, yeah. - Yeah you know exactly, that's exactly what I said yeah, so. - You came, you were acting like you were mulling the whole idea and, running-- - Yeah, right right. - But you showed up to my house with a box, full of clothes that you bought at a consignment store. You knew all along, that I was gonna be the lure, you did. Right? - Now that's the kind of observant hooker I'm talking about. Exactly, just like that. Very good, touche, Hannah, and uh, busted, okay? - Well, thank you very much, Professor Limp Pimp. Is that a good one? - That's very good, I didn't even teach you that one. That's good. - I practiced. - That's good, all right, so look. Let's just go over a few details. - Right. - Okay, just as a means of a little bit of a review. - I, I, I know I, I totally agree, but before we re-enter, whore world, Whore world, yeah. - Yeah, there's something that came to mind to me the his morning and, I mean it was a couple years ago, but it still-- - Wait wait wait wait wait, a couple years ago, has this have any relevance to what we're doing here, I mean, we gotta stay focused. - Yeah, I would not have brought it up unless it had something to do with this! - All right. - I know how important this is! - All right, all right, calm down, jeez! Such a uppity whore! I'm sorry, please do continue. - All right well it was-- - Wait wait wait wait, before you continue, and I'm sorry to interrupt you again but, can we, can we change environment a little bit? I mean I'm so sick of sitting on this beige, and brown blah sofa already. I mean I need a change of scenery. - I get it. - It's not a, it's nothing against your decorating, - I get it, I get it, - I just... - I could use some fresh air or something, you know what, the patio - Yeah can we do that? - Outside. - Can we go on the patio? - Yeah let's go to the patio. - Thank you. I'm not gonna need this out there do I? - No, no. - Okay. - After you. So, as I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted. I was on a date with my boyfriend, who shall remain nameless because, well I don't want to swear like a sailor right now. I'm saving that for tonight. But we're on a date and we're going on his boat, that's basically the only thing we ever did, was go out on his boat. So we're at the marina, and this time, instead of going out on the water, he decided he wanted to take me inside the boat storage building. I was really looking forward to hitting the lake, and I only went because I didn't want to burst his bubble. He needed to brag about a boat he figured he was going to buy as soon as he won the lottery, whoo, like that was ever going to happen. He was trying to impress me and I, I let it go on for a while, but then he tried to take me to a really dim corner on the side of the building. I was very uncomfortable, and I turned to leave, but he pulled me anyway. As he was pointing out one of the yachts, I turned around and saw a man wearing a trench coat with a hoody, and when I looked back he was gone. Ignored me so I took off running towards he entrance. Some workman must have heard me screaming, 'cause I practically ran him over! He wouldn't listen to me either, probably because asshole was making gestures with his hands like I was crazy. I just ran the rest of the way out of the boathouse. - For fuck's sake Rachel! You waited this long to tell me this story? - I'm sorry, I think I must have just pushed it into the back of my mind thinking that maybe it was just a nightmare or something. But it really did happen Jim! - If this, if this was our guy, that guy, that you saw, think about it, that was what two years ago, two and a half years ago? - Uh hmm. - And nobody would have reported anything, you know what I'm saying? - Yes. - It must have been a dream. Tell me, in your dream, did you file a police report? - No! We were trespassing, that's the last thing we were thinking of! We didn't want to get caught! - Yeah I guess that makes sense. Well, uh, what am I supposed to say, thanks for sharing the story? - Well, you could contact the FBI, you know, tell 'em you got an anonymous tip, and, go from there. - Yeah yeah, I'll do that. Tomorrow. In the meantime, you and I have a lot more John talk to take care of. All right? - All right, I'm not dressed for John talk, unless you count the shoes. - Well that's fine. Hello, hi Doreen what's up my friend? - Hey Danny, um, can you come by please, I really really need to talk to you. There's something that's really been troubling me for a while, and I really really need to see you. So, do you-- - Relax, are you all right, did something happen to you or-- - No, no no no, not, nothing like that, I just, well it's personal, and it's really really important, could you please come over? Sure honey, sure, I'm less than five minutes away, is that all right? - Of course, of course, and Danny, thanks for caring so much. I'll see you in a bit. - Okay bye. - Okay bye-bye. Thank you for coming Danny, have a seat. - Wow, I mean, you had me pretty shaken up on the phone, what's wrong, I mean something with the kids? - The kids are fine, Danny. - Okay. - I'm in love with you. - You're what, what did you just say? - I just can't handle you not knowing any longer. I've been in love with you since the day I met you. - But I'm happily married, for god's sakes! - I know, I know, what am I supposed to do? What are we supposed to do? - We? - Yeah hell, we! Don't you feel the same way about me? Don't you love me too Danny? - What makes you think I feel the same way about you as you feel about me Doreen, I mean I'm happily married. What are you doing right now? - But I am too! - I know, that's why we don't need to do anything, but continue being neighbors, friends! Trust me I'm flattered, but I can't! - No, that's not right, you told me you loved me! You told me that you did! Listen, I'm happily married! - I am too! - That's right, you are too! So there's nothing we need to do, but continue being friends, neighbors, I'm flattered, trust me, but I can't! - No that's not right! You told me you loved me, - Get off me bitch! - You don't remember? You told me, what did I do, to make you turn away from me? Please, make love to me! - Are you crazy, get off me! -, Now! - I never told you I love you, not like love-love, like a friend, like a neighbor, like somebody sweet enough to watch my kids, and again? What the hell are you talking about again? I have never made love to you! I have kissed you on the cheek maybe once! Maybe twice! Jesus, I gotta get out of here! - No, no! - Get off me, what is wrong with you, what are you doing? - If you leave me Daniel Leno, the first thing I'll do is call your wife, and tell her look, you came over here and tried to rape me! And the next thing I'll do is call the cops! Is that what you want? - You do whatever the hell you want, you sick bitch! Oh my god are all women filthy whores on this planet? Time for Daniel to go to work, isn't it, mother! - Now I'm just gonna ask you a question. - Okay. - A simple question. - Uh hmm. - It's gonna tell me a lot about you. Ready? - Okay. - So what do you think about the Lions chances of making it to the playoffs this year? - Seriously, you really - want to know my opinion? - Yeah, yeah. - Well, - I gotta hear this. - Since Megatron is gone, the offense is just gonna have to rely on Stafford, it's all gonna rest on his shoulders. Or should I say, his passing arm. - Wait wait, - What? - Really. - Yeah. - Yeah wait wait wait, are you into sports too? I mean, is this a mirage? Am I really, are you really here? You-- - What? - You know about the Lions? - I don't like-- Oh, yeah, well I also know about the Tigers, and the Pistons, I follow them sometimes. But the Wings I like, yeah. - That's it, I have officially just died, I've passed away, and I'm now in man-cave heaven. I can't believe you know all that about sports. That's just wrong. - Come here, I wanna show, I wanna... - Show me something. - I just want to show you something. It's about right here. - What do you want to show me? Wow. Yeah I do like that. What was that all about? - You make me feel safe and, I trust you, I trust this night. - Wow. We're gonna get this guy tonight, right? - Yes. - Okay.

All right. - I understand. - You know this whole hunch of mine might end up being a giant waste of time. I just want to, thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for even daring to do this. It's crazy, you know. - Jimmy, besides Jake, you are the only reason that I'm doing this. - All right, with that in mind, remember, if you feel in your gut that this is our guy, after you look through his entire vehicle - Right, I know that. - And make sure... Don't just nod! - I remember the training. - All right, okay, okay I trained you well, right? - Uh-hmm - Know that I'm only far enough behind, so that he doesn't feel like he's got a tail. - Right. - Okay? - I know you got my back.

No, the other hand. They say white boys can't shoot. - Jump. - Oh that's right, that's right, you know all of it don't you? All right, we gotta have some kind of a sign, okay, that I know you're okay when you're encountering somebody. So if everything's all right, I want you to just step back from the car and, I don't know, kind of like wave your purse twice. - Do I have to go... - Yeah yeah exactly, twice like that, twice means everything's okay. - All right. - And what I'll do is I'll counter that with, I'll just, I'll hit my flasher twice. - Okay, all right. - Okay? - Okay. - Simple right? - Yeah, I got it. - You all right? - Uh-hmm. - You can do this you know. - Yeah, I know it. - You know why? - Why? - Because you have the greatest teacher. - That's... - You're the best whore I ever created.

Or what name are you using tonight? - No no no no, what are you doing? What are you doing? Not so soon, not so soon, you didn't even look! - And what's with that, stocking? You can't be that hideous, maybe uh, scars, acne, what is it? Ah so, you don't like Tina, then you can call me Angel. Or you know what you can call me whatever the fuck you want, I don't care, as long as you're happy. Make the customer happy, that's my motto. - Rachel, Rachel! - But seriously, can you actually see from that thing? Hey, I'm not hitting the road with you if you're wearing that, stupid ass, stocking on your face. So, you're not going to say anything? That's fine, I like the strong, silent type. So, why don't we just get down to business, huh? Do you want a BJ, or you want a, a whole freaking party tonight? You gotta give me something so I know what to do with your ass... Huh, how about uh, I just throw something out there and if it's something that you like you just nod your head up and down, or shake your head side to side if it's no, okay? Oh, how about a little 50-50 action? Or how about, around the mother fucking world, you look like someone who might like that? Seriously, if you're, if you're not going to say anything then this party's gonna be over, 'cause I don't have any guarantees but I am the best thing that you'd ever had. All right, fine, maybe I just have to take matters into my own hot little hands, huh? Oh, so help me, I will cut you! I swear to! Oh! Help! Jim, it's him,! Daddy! Daddy, oh.
