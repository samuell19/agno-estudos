What? Calm down. No! I told you that. No, listen. No. I didn't have anything to do with that. I'm not trying to double-cross you. Listen, it was the guys from... Listen, just try to be... Oi! Can I bum a cigarette, mate? What? No. Listen, it was the guys from... I didn't have anything to do with that. Please, just calm down. Give us a cigarette. - Get off. - Give us a cigarette. Fuck off! What? No, no, not you. No, it's just this prick trying to nick a cigarette. I'm not insulting you. Done. Come in. Sammy! Good to see you. Come in. Look at you. Very elegant. - Very fancy. - Thank you. Sarah, say hello to Sammy. - Hi. - Hi. My office. Now. I don't understand why you treat me like this. Haven't I always been good to you? When you arrived from Paris, did I not take care of you? Did I not welcome you into my family with open arms? - Did I not give you work? - You did. So why do you do this to me? Can I speak? I've got good news. I got all the money. Are you dumb? I don't handle business on Shabbat. I'll keep it, then. Don't be stupid. Give it to him. I can't take it either. Fuck you! You take it and you put it in the safe. - Are you gonna open it? - No, it's electronic. I don't know the combination. Can we go now? No. You. Punch him. What the fuck was that for? That, my boy, was for being a sick, degenerate asshole, who took the risk of gambling my money, and you could easily have come here today with nothing to give me. How do you know about... You think I don't know everything you do every fucking minute of the day? Now pull yourself together, and go back to the table. Father? Could I maybe go up to my room? Yeah, OK. Yes! You know I bought a new dress for Reuben's barmitzva? Yeah? Is it a sexy one? No, not sexy. Of course it's sexy. I bought it. If she wears it, it's going to be sexy. Sarah, are you sure you don't want to come with us to the synagogue? Yeah, I can't. I have to study. That's OK. So, you coming with us or what? No, thanks, it's not my thing. - Stay out of trouble, OK? - Always. Did you know your father sells ecstasy? There's a shit load in his office. No, no! I want some. No... No, come on. You sure? All right. Okay. How do you know the combination? It's my birthday, isn't it? I don't know your birthday. You're pushing it. Happy birthday. - Do you want one? - No, no, they're for you. I'd rather have some coke. Coke sucks! No one does it any more. I do coke. Yeah, but that's because you're old! I love you. I love you. I'm going to take a shower. Sarah? Get up. Get up! Wake up! Get the fuck out of my house. Get out of my house. The police is coming. But mark my words. You're a fucking dead man. Now fuck off! You get out of here. Police, madam. We need to speak with Mr. Bronstein. Please don't. No, please don't. You don't want to do this. You don't want to do this. Eat. Eat. Please don't. - Another one. - No, please don't. Another one. I don't want to die. I have a family. Another one. I will find you wherever you are, you little piece of shit. And I will kill you. No bags? So, that sign is really discreet! - Is Levy your real name? - No. So? Wearing sunglasses in November? That's discreet? If you saw my eyes, you would ask me to put them back on. Great. You're drunk? And I'm not Cornelius's driver. I am Cornelius. Are we really going to use those stupid code names? No. - I'm Claes. - I'm Sammy. No smoking in the car. His name is Peter Rasmussen. He's 53 years old. Senior executive. In this folder, I got his address, and a list of all the places he hangs out. Are you even listening? I can count and listen at the same time. You keep this phone on you all the time. And you wait for me to call you to tell you when, where and what. Got it? Yeah. What about the gun? No gun. The client wants it to look like an accident. Don't worry, Avi. We'll find him. Can you close the window? You stink. Can I smoke if the window is open? No. Great! What's the hold-up? It's the changing of the guards. They look really stupid with their big-ass hats. They look like giant sex toys. It's not stupid. It's the Royal Danish Elite Guards. They must be really scary when they show up with their huge furry hats. When I was 20, I was one of them. And I can promise you, with the training we got, we scared the shit out of people. Then why have me come in if you're that good? I had you come because I don't kill any more. So what's your job now, then? Consultant, head of security to a large international company. I do e-mail surveillance, industrial espionage, and cameras, and... - Nice gun. - Yeah. Sure you don't want anything more gangster? A Desert Eagle, my brother. That's some classy shit. Cherry Pie has one just like that. Stop pointing that at me, right now. Who is Cherry Pie? Me. I'm Cherry Pie. OK, whatever. I'll take this one and five grams of this, too. Ten grand. You're supposed always to pick up this phone! The deal is off. You'll still get your money. And I'll see you tomorrow. I repeat, the deal is off. Sorry, I don't speak Danish. It's me. How are you, mon ami? Good. Well, there's a problem with your friend. He didn't do what was asked of him. Actually, he did the exact opposite. And the situation has become delicate. So I was wondering... Are you sure it is the only way? No, no, I trust you. Yes. Yes, he was a good friend. I think that you probably make a mistake, but listen... you do what you have to do. And please, forgive me for this. Well, goodbye, my friend. You want to go outside? Get some food, or we could do something else? No outside. - No? - No. But I want to do something. Yes? Yes, I'll be right down. Why don't you ever pick up the phone? I picked it up this time, didn't I? Did you listen to the message I left last night? No, because the answering machine is all in Danish, so I didn't understand it. - Do you have my money? - Yeah, I've got it. It's at my office. Where's your office? It's not far. What's going on? Change of plans. The client wants to meet you. Me? Why? I guess he's impressed. What if I don't want to meet him? Ah, come on! It's not a trap. If it's not a trap, why are you laughing? I'm sorry. It's fine. Trust me. I promise you. The police said, "Did you know that Mr. Rasmussen had gambling debts?" And I said, "Gambling debts? "And to dangerous men, on top of that?" So, for you. Fuck! That shit is good. It's schnapps. But you've got to be careful. It's a trap. You know, actually aquavitis Latin for "water of life." Isn't that ironic? Yes. Yes, indeed. No, we are all terribly saddened by this horrible news. Yeah, thank you. It's like I'm being reborn. Like I'm starting all over again. I feel sharper, I feel stronger, I even feel taller. - Physically taller? - Physically. I don't think that's possible. I want to thank you for making the decision for me. I don't think I would have had the guts. -Can I ask you a personal question? -Sure. What's it like to kill a man? You tell me. What do you mean? You just killed him, didn't you? I just pulled the trigger. I think it's the one that's paying that's actually doing the killing. I don't understand. You killed him. I'm just the gun. So what you're telling me is, that I'm a killer? You're a killer. How does that make you feel? I don't know. I think I like it! I even got the gun, already. There you go. Now... Now look. - That's a Luger, right? - Yeah, it's my grandfather's. Lars. - Put that down. - Yeah, yeah. I don't even know how to use it! So you knew they would pin the murders on the Serbians? That was risky. If it hadn't worked out, I would have to... - I thought you didn't kill anymore. - I don't. And I'm happy that I didn't have to break my rules for you. Right. - Do you want some? - Nope. I'm going to pretend that you just didn't do that right in front of me. - You don't do drugs? - No, and neither should you. Right. Come on. I don't know where you live, though. I have no idea what she just said, but it turns me on. Is that normal? If you think that is sexy, I do not want you to meet my wife. You have a wife? And she won't mind that we come in the middle of the night, off our faces? No! Mette... she's cool. You'll see. How about if we wake up the kids? No kids. Sure you don't want anything? I'm OK, thanks. You're holding up well. Well, we didn't drink that much. No, I mean, you look good for somebody who just killed a random guy. Oh, you know about...? See, I don't think he was a random guy. If he were a random guy, then why would somebody pay me that much money to kill him? Is that how you deal with it? Whatever suits you, I guess. Look, he made bad choices and he paid for them. That's that. I didn't mean to be intrusive. You don't have to explain to me. He would have gone one way or another, right? Exactly. You have to try this. It's gravlax. And I made it. It's wild salmon, seasoned with sea salt, sugar and dill. The Vikings used to bury it underground for a couple of months. I set up Jonas's room for you. It's way too late to go back to the hotel. Who is Jonas? Um, I set up the guest room for you. It's ready. - Morning. - Morning. - Want a coffee? - Yeah. - Your head aches? - Yeah, it's the fucking aquavit. So... What are you going to do now? I don't know. Go back to bed? No, I mean, are you going to stay or go back to London? The hotel is paid for a week, it would be stupid not to take advantage of it. No. Great! There's actually a lot of things to see. Most people just go and see the Little Mermaid or Tivoli. Or the changing of the guards. You're in very good shape in the morning. I don't know. Sure, why not? Great. Sorry, I've got to go to work. For the hangovers, we've got a sauna. You should try it. It helps get rid of the toxins. I'll call you later. You should take that off. - It might burn. - What, this? I never take it off. I feel naked without it. You're Jewish? Can't you tell? So you're circumcised? Are we that close that we're discussing my foreskin situation? It's just a big debate in Denmark right now. - Yeah? - They want to ban circumcision. Really? Why? They think it's barbaric. But it feels better for women, though, right? When I was in Africa, I helped doing hundreds of circumcisions. So you were a mohelin Africa? What's a mohel? Mohelis the Rabbi that cuts off the baby's dick. It's not only for babies. It's for grown men too. In some villages we did over 200 a day. I don't know if it's any better for women or not, but... for men, it helps reduce their chance of getting AIDS by ten. Great. Do you know what's really good, after a hot sauna? What? A cold shower. I'm glad you called. I wanted to see you again, but... Nice place. - How much you want? - Two. Thanks, man. Thank you. Do you remember when we studied Jethro? Hashem sometimes takes the sins of the parents into account, when punishing the children for the evil that they've done... Are you saying that it's my fault my daughter has died? Is this the shit you teach my son? Well, you know what? Go to Hashem and tell him to fuck himself. You see, there, you hear the wise man. Please, come in. I've got a job for you. If you're up for it. Sure. Get dressed, then. So you're not going to come with me? No. You're going to let me go in there on my own? Seriously? - If I thought you couldn't... - Bullshit! I told you, I won't do this. I will not kill. So please stop asking. If I were you I'd go to bed early tonight. You'll need all your strength. - Stop. - Why? Stop. It's enough! - What's enough? - I'm sick of this. Sick of what? You just call when you want to fuck. You can't treat people like that. I'm not a whore. Well, I've never offered to pay you, have I? This is going nowhere. - Come on... - No. Stop! I don't speak Romanian. Fuck you. I think you'll be happy with a Beretta. Or a Glock. Damn, you have an Uzi! Yeah. I haven't got the silencer. Sorry. Did you have an Uzi in the Israeli military? I was never in the Israeli military. Do we really need a silencer? You really need a silencer. Where did you do the army, then? Nowhere. Shit! Give me a Beretta, then. You're a stubborn fuck, aren't you? No smoking in the car. You're going to get in the way of my last cigarette? - You're quitting? - Yeah. Fuck! Fuck! You OK? Yeah, I'm fine. You did seven. I did six. You win. Great. Can we go now? You're hit? Fuck! You're hit! Come on, get up. Get up! Keep the pressure on that bandage, Sammy. Stay awake, Sammy. Stay awake. You're doing better. Your fever is down. I'm going to check your bandages. OK. - A little morphine? - Oh, yeah. You little junkie! - Hold this. - It's really good, that stuff. Hold it. Did you learn to treat gunshot wounds in Africa? Yeah. I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war. Is this where you met Claes? Yeah. He was a mercenary, back then. He shot people, I fixed them back up. We were complementary. Apparently, you still are. I guess so. What are you doing? Nothing, I was just... It's OK. - You're up. - Yeah. - You shouldn't be. - I feel better. Come on. You need your shot. It's freezing. It's revigorating. The air will be good for you. Can I ask you a question? - Sure. - Why did you stop? Killing? Sometimes you get signs. Like when... When we lost our son. When Jonas died... I chose to believe that what happened to me happened because of the things that I've done. So I stopped doing them. That's way too Christian for me. It's actually Viking. The Vikings used to believe that under the Tree of Life, the Norns would weave the thread of all men's fate. What's a Norn? Goddesses of fate. Past, present and the future. And they would... It's complicated. Lately, I've been feeling that it doesn't matter that much anyhow, what I do. Might as well just start doing it again. Are you crazy to let him out in the cold? And you're smoking? Are you OK? - I'll go for a run. - All right. Sammy, could you pour me a whisky, please? - Sure. - And bring yours. Thank you. Don't smoke. It's funny, how Claes has taken to you. That never happens. I like him. You too. You guys are funny together. Funny? You're very free. Free, huh? I mean, you know, you're there, and I'm here, talking to you. Because I'm naked? Yes. You know, it's nothing special to see someone naked. If he saw us together, you naked in there, me here, he wouldn't mind at all? Just light me one of your cigarettes, would you? So... London? Did you leave London because of a woman? I don't want to talk about it. Why not? It seems we all have our little secrets. If you ever want to talk about it... If you ever want to talk about it... Right. What are you doing? Where is Claes? He's sleeping. What happened last night must never happen again. Right. I know that. How lucky I am, to live with two such handsome men. I love this place! Whose idea was this? Oh, yeah, of course. My little hired gun! You said you had some work for us. Can I get you gentlemen something to drink? Whisky, neat. Are you sure you don't prefer a bottle of champagne? Yeah. Whisky, neat. I'll have the same. - Yeah, I'll have a whiskey too. - You? You're not thirsty. What was that? - You two know each other? - Yeah, a little bit. Do you want me to go talk to her? - No, no, no... - Are you sure? - No, don't... - Back in a second. No, please. I'll be back in a second. - Wait. - What do you want? There's this guy at my table... Yeah? So what? So he's a very rich and powerful man, and he likes you. - So you do see me as a whore? - No! I'm just saying... I know exactly what you're saying. You can leave now. Thank you very much. Leave. Please. What I wanted to talk to you about is... In Oslo... there's this guy... I'm having trouble with him. You would like us to take care of him? Exactly. - Ever been to Norway before? - Nope. You smoke too much. Fucking Norwegians. Norwegians are cool. It's the Swedes who are assholes. Swedes, Norwegians, Danes... You all look the same to me. - No, we don't. - Yeah. He looks exactly like you. No, he doesn't. Yeah. Do you want to party tonight? Because I know a great place. So... Coke? It's speed. Yes. It's good. I bought this disgusting speed from this girl because I thought it was coke, and now my face is all numb. You think this is funny? If you want to work with me, no drugs. I've told you this before. I hate drugs! Listen, we've got a good thing going, and hopefully it's just the beginning. Don't fuck it up. Yeah, whatever, Dad. What's this? It's... Did you think I was a hooker? No, I'm sorry... Take your money back. I'm not a prostitute. No, of course you're not. I'm sorry. It's fine. - Let's not talk about it. - Cheers. Cheers. So... How well do you know Sammy? I don't care about Sammy. You're the one I want. You know I work with Sammy? I'm a killer. You're my killer. We've looked over the numbers. And we can not do better. This is our last offer. I'm sorry, sir, he won't go down on the price. He's dead. He just doesn't know it yet. Come on, jump. - What time is it? - Let me see. - Really? - What? I think we missed our plane. Great. I'm starving. Where have you been? Don't tell me, you've been buying drugs. No. Don't worry. Come on, drink up. I'm tired, I want to go to bed. What? That's a new one. You're tired? Come on! Hurry up. - Have one yourself. - I'm not thirsty. Let me finish my drink. Hurry up. Good night. - Can I help you with something? - I'm your present. Of course you are. Could you excuse me for a minute? Thank you. - Are you kidding? - What? What's that lady doing in my room? She's your present. Are you insane? Come in. I thought you would be happy. Why would I be happy? You're always talking about Africa and the hookers, and "Once you go black you never go back." That's a long time ago. Before I met Mette. You never cheated on her? Me? No. - Never. - Because I thought... - You thought what? - Nothing. It's because... you cannot even begin to imagine how crazy I am about her. It's hard to describe. She's everything to me. The reason why I get up in the morning. That's got to be nice. Nicer than these hotel chocolates. Imagine all those people that travel all year long, with these stupid, heart-shaped chocolates, as their only sign of human warmth. Mette has made flaeskesteg. What the fuck is flaeskesteg? It's a traditional Danish Christmas dish. You have to extract the meat from the breast or the neck from the pig, and keep the rind to obtain crispy crackling... I don't eat pig. I've been living in this house for a month and you still didn't get that? I don't eat pig. Then how are you understand our culture if you don't eat the flaeskesteg? Well, I guess I won't. And I don't celebrate Christmas either. Jesus Christ! Wait. Don't do that. Claes might see us. You've got to be shitting me. It's just marzipan. I don't eat pig. It's candy, you idiot. I still won't eat it. Wait, don't. No. Don't. So, you're buying her presents, now? You're in love with her, aren't you? How is that your problem? We have to stop this. - Stop what? - This. You coming. You have to stop. So you're breaking up with me? I guess I am. Then you'll never fucking see me again. - I'd like that very much. - You piece of shit. - Who are you talking to? - No one. No one. Come here. Wait. - I don't want that. - Why not? - I just don't want it. - But you haven't even opened it. Please put that down. Here. So, do we have a deal? Yes. Perfect. What's wrong? It's just the first time we get so little information on a hit. Look how thin this file is. Who gives a fuck? I'm just wondering... what a 30-year-old art director could have done to him. Do you have any coke? Maybe. You live in Berlin? No. Are you an Arab? No. A Jew? Yes. Circumcised, then. Tunisian? Moroccan? How did you know? My parents are Tunisian. We're neighbours. - Did you come with someone? - Yeah. Me too. We're engaged to be married. - Mazel tov! - Thank you. My name is Tarik. What's your name? Vincent. How do I see you again? I don't know. - Come on, let's go. - What? Did you do it? No. We'll do it some other time. Sure you don't want to go for a drink? No. I don't feel too good. - It's still early. - Let's get the car. Avi, we have a new lead. Some guy he worked with in Paris. I'm out. - I'm happy that you came. - Me too. Where are we going? Right here. Right here? I didn't know you were so romantic. I don't know any Sammy Cohen. I don't know any Levy, or Rubenstein or Rosenfeld. I don't know them, and you know what? I don't like them. Hit him. You don't know any Sammy Cohen? That's not what I heard. I've heard that not only you know him, but you also helped him get out of London. And now I want to know where he is. You know who I am and what I do, so you can probably imagine that you will not have any password, no information, no matter how hard you will hit me! I guess we have to find out. I cannot believe that he's that stupid! I don't read Danish. "The soon-to-be husband of the son of a rich industrialist "was the victim of a homophobic crime." Fucking roøvhul, mand. Idiot! Come on. Morning, guys. Coffee? What you did was careless. - It wasn't careless, it was... - Careless and dangerous. You can't do things like that and not tell us. You wouldn't have taken the job had I told you. - God damn right. - You let me do the talking. - How is he treating you? - Good. - I feel like a princess. - Really? That's nice. Listen, if you ever get tired of that old fuck, you call me. Maybe. - You're not eating? - Not hungry. I never want to see that prick again. Then don't. Then who are we going to work for? I don't know. Why don't we go on a vacation and spend some of that cash? Because I have to save and reimburse the bank, the house, the car... That sounds a bit boring. Yeah, it's boring. That's easy for you to say. You've got no responsibilities. I didn't get into this line of work to have responsibilities. I'm beat. I'm going to bed. Night, honey. Do you want to go to bed? I'm sick of this. Sick of what? Sick of doing the same thing every night. I want to do something, I want to go out, I want to party. We can party. Where do you want to go? We can party right here. Then I have to call a friend. - So, this is where you live? - Yeah. Nice place. - Good night. - Take care. I can't believe I fell for a whore. Because that's all you are, right? A whore. Don't you think I saw you with him? With who? Sammy? You like being treated like a whore by that little, pathetic gangster? I don't know what you're talking about. I never charged him. You disgust me. Hello, Victorine? Can I speak to our friend? But haven't you heard? What have I done to you? Nothing. I buy you everything you want. It's not enough. Every time you're done fucking me you go home to your wife, your big house... and I go back to my shitty life. What is it that you really want? You want me to leave my wife? Just say it. You would leave your wife for a whore? I'm sorry about calling you that. Of course you are. It's simple. You pay me what I want, or I send these to your wife. You're a businessman. So what will cost you more? This or a divorce? I can't believe that you're doing this to me. To our friend. Skaål. So you met him in Africa? No. Actually when I got back. He gave me my first contracting jobs. We used to work together in Paris. I'm beat. I think I want to go home. Do you want to come? You go. I want to have a few more. No. You don't need a lap dance, you need some water. Please let me through. Let me through. Thank you. Hey, Cherry Pie. 500. - This one? - Yeah. Good stuff. Nice place you've got here. Come on, have a drink. Cherry Pie. You said you were going to leave me alone. Oh, come on! You know I'm never going to leave you. Yeah, I know. - Who are you talking to? - What? No one. Sell me another gram. - I think you should confront him. - Who? - Avi? - Yes. How do you know? How do you know about... Oh, you're some kind of... I know because you fucking told me, you idiot. Avi, it's me. Listen, we need to talk. Talk about what? What do you want to hear? You want to hear how your French friend... squealed as I cut off his balls? Of course it was me. You want to kill me? You come and find me. I'm in Copenhagen, motherfucker. Come tomorrow night at the Babylon Club. It's a strip club, you're going to fucking love it, OK? Have a great night. Sammy! Wake up, it's four o'clock. Can I have a cigarette? Thanks. What time are you meeting Avi? I have to go. Thanks. I need your help. He's going to kill me. He's going to... No... Fuck. You whore. You fucking little immigrant whore. Where were you? -We were worried. -I don't have time. Where is Claes? - What's wrong? - We have to go. There's a big problem with Lars. Hey, guys. Where is she? Who? Stop messing around! Where's Lena? Honestly, I haven't seen her in... No, no... - You OK? - Yeah. Come on. Put it down. Come on, put it down. You don't even know how to use it. Are you sure? I'm a gun, now. I'm just a gun. Come on. - I'm sorry. - Shut up! Fuck you. They know where you live. - What? - They know where you live. My dealer came to the house. They found my dealer. We have to go. What are you talking about? I'm really sorry. Please, let's go. If something has happened to her, I'm going to kill you. You stupid, stupid fuck! Go, go, go! Fuck! You know why I'm doing this? Have you any idea what it feels like to lose a child? I thought your daughter died because she took your pills. He doesn't care about you. You know he doesn't care about you? He doesn't care about you. What is she doing here? She's coming with us. When we get to the next town, drop us off. I'm going to take care of her now. So now you're going to fuck her life up as well? That's what I do. I fuck people's lives up. Like I fucked up your life, I fucked up your house, and I even fucked... Jesus Christ! Don't you ever stop talking about yourself? You bitch, moan, blame yourself for everything... Give me a cigarette. You're a smoker, now? Maybe we needed this. Maybe we weren't alive in that house any more. We can start a new life. We've got money, we can go anywhere. So, where are we going? I have no idea. I guess France is out of the question. No, I can never go back to France. England, too? Same. What about Morocco? My family had problems in Morocco. What about Sierra Leone? No! Angola, Mozambique... actually the whole of Africa. We can't go to Romania either. How about Australia? That's far. Far from where?
