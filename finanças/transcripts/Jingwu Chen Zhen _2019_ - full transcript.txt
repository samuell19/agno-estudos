Thank you, sir. I see. What do you think about the future of China? China. Great question. Wait a minute. Little girl. Are you free to play with us? Little girl. Play with us, will you? Sorry. Please don't do this. Help! Play with us, huh? Come on. Let me go. You are... Chinese? Sorry. Sorry. She's Japanese! Speak up. You're Japanese. Hurry. Say you're Japanese and you’ll be fine. Speak up. Are you Japanese or not? Say you're Japanese and you’ll be fine. I am Chinese! You see. Another Chinese. Let me go. She is an international student. Let me go. Let me go. Let her go. I’ll fight with you till the end! Let me go. Let me go. Stop. Who? In China, there is a Jingwu School dedicated to fighting Japs. You’re courting death. Get them out of here. Breaking news! Breaking news! Chinese masked swordsman beat Japanese ronins. Breaking news! Breaking... Japanese samurais were ambushed, Black Dragon Society has intervened for investigation. Get rid of the evil for the people. The glory of Japanese Bushido didn't get tainted. Pay attention. Come here. Impressive. Indeed the best of Black Dragon Society. Funakoshi is the best of Black Dragon Society. Mr. Fujita, speak to your mind. This is yesterday's paper. If we want to defeat the Chinese completely, we should do it in the Chinese way. Subdue your enemies without a fight. Mr. Chiyo, I want you to go to Tianjin, to challenge this Jingwu School. Mr. Chiyo, anything you want to say? This is today's paper. Bastard. Defend personal freedom, keep the villains from bullying. Defend personal freedom, keep the villains from bullying. You guys deal with the students. Yes. You find out those who play Kung Fu here. Go get them out. Yes. One. Two. Three. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. One. Two. Three. Four. Chen Zhen. You are here. I'll introduce my master to you. Master, this is my friend Chen Zhen. Hello. Tesley. This way. Are you here to learn Kung Fu with us? I want to ask you about some skills. You see this. You look down on our Kung Fu? Then why you came? Debang. Master. Kung Fu is not for competition. Yes, master. Chase after! Defend personal freedom, keep the villains from bullying. Mitsuko. Chen Zhen. Get him! Get there. Over here. Mitsuko. Tesley. Are you all right? Don't get innocent people hurt. Awesome! Miss Mitsuko, why are you here? Ninja Chiyo, Why are you arresting people so casually? I got the order from Ministry of the Army, from Colonel Fujita. But these are not men from Army Headquarters. Miss Mitsuko, you know I like you. Please don’t make me feel awkward. When did the Black Dragon Society become the minions of the Ministry of the Army. Uncle Funakoshi. Mitsuko. Are you in trouble? Yes. I am. Please help us. Don't be afraid. We have Japanese Constitution in Japan. President, at your order. He is... the one Mitsuko takes a fancy to, right? Young man, looks like you're good at Kung Fu. However, fists can’t get everything fixed. Our next plan is to attack the Northeast. Look closer. Mr. Chiyo, can’t you be more polite? I’ve found out that during the day riot, one of the Chinese warriors is called Chen Zhen. His master is Huo Yuanjia. I suspect he’s just the one who caused the street riot last night. Mr. Chiyo, did you get the point of this map? We, together with China, will build a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. China is a big cake, and we need a sharp knife for it. These Chinese warriors are good for us to sharpen our knife. You take care of the Jingwu School, I’ll help you impeach Funakoshi in the cabinet. After this, you’ll be the president of Black Dragon Society. Deal. We’ll certainly kill Chen Zhen. Chen Zhen, you have been studying in Japan for three years, yet I don't know you can play Kung Fu. Exactly, Chen Zhen. Who are you on earth? Chen Zhen, do you think we’re not good enough to be your friends? How come? I am from the Jingwu School of China. Jingwu School? Does it mean you are the big hero on the newspaper? You don’t know that? Then which hero are you? Stop talking to him. That hero came out strong, and the ronins were beaten up so badly. Chen Zhen, you're really good at Kung Fu. It might be you, I guess? No. Chen Zhen usually doesn't hurt others. Shouldn’t be him. I think so. What are you looking at? That guy who beat Japanese is at least a hero. He's nothing but a traitor in collusion with Japanese. Excuse me, why did you say that to Chen Zhen? I killed people in Shandong, and I’m now an outlaw. Your name is Chen Zhen, huh? If you don't fear death, then compete with me. Your Honor, you break something, you pay for it. Money, none; my life, you can take it, you want it? How could you behave this way? Chen Zhen, dare to fight with me or not? How could you be so rude? Sir, here’s the money for liquor. Chinese don’t beat Chinese. Chen Zhen - If you have guts, beat Japanese. Don't bully Chinese here. Quite right. You said what? You’re the same, you're all cowards. I don't even fear death, how can I fear those Japs? I’m gonna show you the fight right now. Mr. Chiyo, a Chinese boxer comes to challenge. Step aside. If you've got something, fight one on one with me. - Chen Zhen - Mitsuko, go! Tesley. You two get back to school and wait for me. Why? If you want to learn Kung Fu, then go. Chen Zhen, what happened to you? Don't ask, just go. Chen Zhen, gentlemen must keep their words... Who are you guys? Ones to take your life. Zhao Sibei, descendant of Shandong Tumbling Boxing. Your father, Zhao Wujiu, quite famous when he was alive. But you achieved nothing, worse still, you killed, and was guilty. Pursued by the authorities. You went into exile, and ran to our Great Empire of Japan. You’re not good at Kung Fu, but you have courage. The gendarmes are pursuing you, yet you come here to challenge me. Compared to those timid Chinese, you are more of a hero. But, there is one thing you don't you understand. No matter how powerful fists are, they are no match for guns. Put it back to sheath. Just kill me. Think about it. You are willing to continue exile, or revive your Zhao’s Tumbling Boxing. As long as you follow me, I promise no one will pick on you. You will be the best Kung Fu fighter of China. Chen Zhen, in your trip to Japan, keep your purpose for this trip in mind. You’re going for learning and hiding. Form-Intention Fist. Chen Zhen. Chen Zhen. Chen Zhen, are you OK? I’m fine. Who are those guys? Just now were Iga Ninjas. Hello, young man. Didn’t expect to meet you again so soon. Chen Zhen, let me introduce you to each other. You've seen him, Uncle Funakoshi, helped us last time. Fortunately, you are not here to fight with Chen Zhen. Mitsuko, indeed I’m here to challenge Chen Zhen. I was entrusted by the cabinet minister. Uncle Funakoshi. It’s unfair if you challenge Chen Zhen at the moment. Yes, certainly it's unfair. Moreover, I also disdain the insidious way of killing by the Iga School. However, Mitsuko, some cabinet members were indeed entrusted by the Army Headquarters. If I don’t challenge Chen Zhen, they will freeze the funds for Black Dragon Society. They will send another one to replace me as the President. You are the grand master of Japan. You shouldn’t attack someone in peril. Mitsuko, you're so adorable. Chen Zhen, shall we have a talk alone? Chen Zhen. Uncle Funakoshi. Opposing Japanese in Japan is not a wise decision. If you are afraid, return to your country at an early date. Japanese are now belligerent in China. Even if I go back to China one day, I will teach them with your words. Good. Amazing. You've already won a fight, but what would it be like when fighting with me? I never thought about fighting with you. That’s great. I was really afraid you would agree with an impulse. If I killed you, Mitsuko would swear at me very hard. And she wouldn't call me the grand master again. Well, I’ll fight with you. Well. As a Chinese saying goes, “Gentlemen must keep their words”. Right? Chen Zhen, even if I don't fight with you, those Japanese won’t let you go. What are you doing? Step aside. Quiet, quiet. Listen, everybody! Don't fight. Excuse me... My name is Zhao Sibei, the President of Chinese Martial Arts in Japan. I’m here today to challenge. What president, nonsense! Just a traitor. Exactly, a traitor. Master. Stop arguing. Don't fight. I’m fine. Master Zhao, all of us are Chinese. We’re here for work, and practice boxing occasionally. It’s just for fitness, not for challenging others. Master Zhao, you may got the wrong place. Wrong place? We’ll find it out after the fight. You rogue. Oh, it's you, the foreign devil. You followed the wrong man Chen Zhen, and now you picked a wrong master. You’d better let me be your master, and you will be respected by others. How about that? You bastard! Brother, are you OK? Help him to go in and get some medicine for the wound. You’re not going. You're the descendant of Form-Intention Fist? I'm flattered. I just know a little about it. Don’t even try to fool me. Check it out with the fight. Master Zhao, we're from the same martial arts tradition. Don't press hard on me. We are both Chinese. Please show your mercy. You know why Chen Zhen don’t want to fight with you? It’s shame for Chinese to fight against Chinese. Take away all the disciples involved in the riot. No, you can’t. What should we do? What should we do, master? What should we do? Everyone, be quiet. I'll find a way to rescue them. What should we do? Chen Zhen, My brothers were arrested. Hurry, go help them. What can we do there? You're very good at Kung Fu. We should just fight them till the end. I promised my master before I came to Japan that I won’t fight with others easily. Fine. I'll do it myself. What's the matter? What happened? No idea. Who? Jingwu School. Chen Zhen, you said you wouldn’t come. Chen Zhen, since you are here, then who's that guy? Hurry, go and save them. OK. Brother, we're here. Rescue them, go. It's you. You know me? Who did it? A masked man, saying he is from the Jingwu School. Chen Zhen. Bastard. Who are you on earth? Form-Intention School. Nonsense. You're not playing Form-Intention Fist. Then why you pretended to be from the Jingwu School? What’s your relation with Mr. Huo Yuanjia? My dear master. Turns out you're an authentic practitioner of Jingwu School. Xue Zili, descendant of the Form-Intention Fist. This is the third time we've met. When did you figure out it was me? Just now. Form-Intention Fist learned from Yue Fei. When I went to see Tesley, the mask of the Statue of Yue Fei had disappeared. Presumably you're wearing it right now. Master Xue, your Form-Intention Fist is strong and powerful. You can make a name from it, but why are you hiding it, and be so overcautious? When I was young, I had a fight with your master Huo Yuanjia. At then, I thought I had got the essentials of the boxing, So I belittled everyone. However, I was defeated by Master Huo just when I started Half-step Crushing Fist. Now I know that for martial arts practitioners, it’s better to hide rather than reveal. So, you got the truth since then, went far across the ocean, and hid in Japan. How about you? Why did you come to Japan? Japanese have been challenging Chinese martial arts. They caused trouble in many martial clubs. I hit a Japanese boxer, and the Japanese took the opportunity to pick on Jingwu School, so my master let me go abroad to hide. If only for hiding, why did Master Huo let you come to Japan? Learn from enemies to gain command of them. That's right. No matter how powerful a boxing art is, it can not save people. Martial arts today is to protect the weak, and to warn our countrymen. Only when everyone is self-reliant can there be hope. You haven't told me why do you pretend to be a practitioner of Jingwu School? It’s a school here. If you dare to barge in, I will charge you. Don’t you dare! Get off of him! You can't do this. Get off of him! Something wrong? Chen zhen, you're despicable. You sneaked into our field and hurt our people. Obviously you tried to assassinate Chen Zhen, yet you're here at the school and frame him up. You think we don’t know this? Miss Mitsuko, I can have a fair duel with Chen Zhen. Whoever loses will take his own life for apology. I didn't come to Japan for competition. I hope you can accept it. Our Great Empire of Japan doesn't welcome cowards relying on women for protection. Chen Zhen, learn to restrain yourself. Beat them to death! Beat him to death! Don't be a hero. Chen Zhen, you Chinese are all weak and sick men. Sooner or later, I’ll shake my fist in China. If you dare, I'll be waiting for you in China. Mr. Chiyo, the reason why Chen Zhen rejected your challenge, is because you're unworthy of it. Chen Zhen, I’ll be on your side. Get out. You timid coward. All of you, the cowards. Mr. Chiyo, letter from Colonel Fujita. Mr. Fujita said, at this rate... Shut up. Tell Fujita, no need to worry. Yes, Hurry! Yes. Mitsuko, how can you like a coward? Chen Zhen, I’ll definitely kill you. I’ve found the one who claimed himself from the Jingwu School. Who's that? One step behind him. Nonetheless, since we've known who he is, we can take care of him anyhow. If I'm not mistaken, he should be Xue Zili of Form-Intention Fist. Go get him out. I want anyone connects to Chen Zhen to die! Mitsuko, right here. Chen Zhen, so this is where you live. It's pretty good. How can such a little space compare to your Western-style house? Because you’re here, Chen Zhen. It's small, but you and me are here. That is great. Chen Zhen, in your eyes, Japanese are wicked, right? In the eyes of Japanese and Westerners, China is very backward, and they can bully Chinese at their will. I came to Japan to learn, for the purpose that Chinese won’t be humiliated and trampled on by others again. Chen Zhen, I can help China with you. Chinese people will be self-reliant. We will not be looked down. I just don't understand why the two nations have to hate each other. Moreover, I don’t understand why you hate Japan so much. I want you to know that I like you, really really like you. Mitsuko, I'm going back to China. Chen Zhen, I’ll follow you, no matter where you go. Chen Zhen, meal's ready. Have a try on my new dish. It’s Chinese cuisine. Smells delicious. Some liquor would be better. Don't worry, it's Master Xue. Chen Zhen. Master Xue. I’ll get you tableware. That would be nice. Master Xue, be seated. About the question you asked me that day, I’ll answer you today. That year, Master Huo’s punch on me enlightened me on martial arts. I was ashamed of myself, so I hid myself completely. Later, I read the newspaper, and got to know he defeated strong men from several nations. I made Jingwu School as my example. So you made use of the name of Jingwu School to oppose the strong and assist the weak. I want to pass on the hope from Master Huo to every Chinese. Sorry. I was selfish. I got Jingwu School involved in. You didn't do it wrong. Inside your heart, Jingwu School is not only a school; it’s a spirit. And that’s exactly the spirit China needs now. This is the Japanese tea I made for you. Thanks, Miss Mitsuko. By the way, Chen Zhen, you've been in Japan very long, haven't you learned to speak Japanese? No need for that. I've learned Chinese. Chen Zhen, I gotta go now. I'll see you out. Chen Zhen, just stop here. OK. Mitsuko is a good girl. Last time at the school, you said you wanted to challenge me. I am an American. American. Take him to the street. Yes. Follow me. My big hero, thanks for saving me. May I know your name? Stop talking. Go. Master. Turns out the big hero I’ve been admiring is you. Stop talking. Go in the opposite direction. No. Master, I want to stay and help you. You wanna help, then go. Go. Yes, master. Master Xue, Form-Intention Fist is a respected boxing art. Why do you pretend to be from the Jingwu School? You're Chinese, but you’re so disgraceful. Man like you can’t understand this. I let you go at the factory last time, but for this time, that’s not gonna happen. Hand over the Form-Intention Fist Script, or your Form-Intention School will be totally wiped out when Japanese come. Over there. Chase after! You have nowhere to leave. Show me your true color. Chen Zhen. Master Xue, go. Chen Zhen. I’ve got you involved under the guise of Jingwu School. Why are you taking risks for me? Any business of Jingwu School is my own business. Moreover, Master Xue, you’re the only descendant of Form-Intention Fist School. Go. Chen Zhen, I don’t give a thought to my own life for long. You don't have to take care of me. Just go. This is not a place for talking. Master Xue, sorry for my offence. Chen Zhen from Jingwu School. Chen Zhen. It's really you. Something wrong. It's the substitute. Don't chase him. You're no match for him. What happened to Master Xue? We'll talk about it inside. Slow down. He's injured. I have medicine for the wound. Get it for me, please. Master Xue, be strong. OK. Mitsuko, medicine. Japanese want to kill us. I’ll send you off at daybreak. OK. Mr. Chiyo, finally have some manners. Colonel Fujita, I'm here to borrow troops from you. Mr. Chiyo, you're not competing in martial arts, you’re killing. It goes against your Bushido spirit. You know? That masked man ganged up with Chen Zhen. They are going to flee back to China soon. You want them to bring the humiliation they've brought to Japan back to China? Ninja Chiyo, don't you forget that all the funds for your Black Dragon Society are covered by my Ministry of the Army. And, Mr. Fujita, don't forget that if they get back to China, the Ministry of the Army will get caught out. After killing Chen Zhen, I am willing to die to make amends. Master Xue, I'll do it. OK. Thanks. Watch out! Master Xue. Master Xue. Master Xue. Chen Zhen, just leave me alone. Go. Chen Zhen, come out if you're a man. Let's fight one on one. Don't do anything rash. Chen Zhen, it's easy to die, but not easy to live on. But as long as you stay alive, you will see the hope. Chen Zhen, it's not a challenge. We want to take your life. Chen Zhen, watch out! How do you feel now? Ready. Leave me alone. Fire. Stop. Mitsuko. Mr. Funakoshi, is there any problem? I am still the president of Black Dragon Society. I don’t care about what bullshit Army Headquarters. If Mitsuko lost even one hair, I would let you pay for it with your life. Mr. Funakoshi, don’t press on me. This is the business of Black Dragon Society. Let's go. I want to compete with Chen Zhen, but it’s a pity that these Chinese don’t even dare to accept the letter of challenge. Chen Zhen, about your friend's death, I will resort to the Japanese Constitution to give them an explanation. Chen Zhen. Mitsuko. Let him go. You're bleeding. I'll take you to hospital. OK. I see. I understand. I’ll fix it. I’ll get it done. I’m very sorry about this. Don't worry. I’ll get it taken care of. The United States government will not pay for any stupid mistake made on Japanese soil by some individual citizen. We will no longer provide any protection for you should you make any trouble in japan. From this point on, you are on your own. You know clearly the right things to do. So cheers, Mr. Consul. Now Mr. Tesley is going back to give his military service. We would think it a direct challenge against US if he is beaten again for no reason. It could be seen as a direct treaty violation. We could even see it as an act of war, disastrous for all of us involved. No more maliciousness. Yankee man! You Jap! You've gone through all the formalities necessary to be an American soldier now, and I’m very proud of you. Congratulations for serving your country. Let's go have a drink. I wanna truly congratulate you for serving your country. You're a man now. I know just a place. Mr. Chiyo, Are you all right? Mr. Chiyo, Come here. Chen Zhen, you scared me. Chen Zhen. What happened to you? Chen Zhen. Ninja Chiyo. Help! Help! Help! Someone? Help me! Help! Help! Hey, Mr. Consul, I’m leaving for America tomorrow. I need you to give this letter to Chen Zhen for me. No problem. I’ll take care of it for you. No worries. Thank you. So, here’s to you, huh? Well, it seems to be you still have something on you mind. What else can I help you with, some unfinished business or something? What else can I do for you? Really, I mean it. There's nothing you can do for me. It's something I gotta taken care of myself, OK? OK. I gotta go. I’m gonna say goodbye to my Chinese friends. Help! No. Let me go. Mitsuko. Bastard. Run. Call Chen Zhen. Go. Help! Help me. Someone? Help me! Let me go. Let me go. Help me! Help me! Help me! Mitsuko. Don't say a word. I'll take you to hospital. Don't say a word. Chen Zhen. Can you teach me Kung Fu now? Yes. Tesley. Stop. Chen Zhen. Martial arts today is to protect the weak, and to warn our countrymen. Only when everyone is self-reliant can there be hope. Chen Zhen. Chen Zhen. I've already had your woman. Chen Zhen. Leave me alone. Bastard. Chen Zhen. Lock this place. Don't let anyone run away. Arrest the murderer Chen Zhen. Stop. What are you doing? Drop your weapon. What are you doing? Mr. Consul, what's that supposed to mean? Mr. Fujita, we are here to investigate the cause of our citizen Tesley’s death. You’d better give a very clear explanation of what went on here. A life for a life. The murderer of Mr. Tesley is this man. However, he has been executed. If you want to investigate, just take him back. Take him away. Go. Now, we're going to take care of our own business. Put the gun down. Get ready! If you want to fight with the Americans, I’ll tell you we’ll fight you till the end. Put the gun down. Chen Zhen, I’ll take another chance to experience your Chinese Kung Fu. You don't deserve to talk Kung Fu. Mr. Consul, please give a helping hand to Chen Zhen when he is in danger. That is my only request. Because Chen Zhen is not just my friend, but also a hero. We respect Tesley’s last wishes, and we’ll begin negotiations with Japanese government. It pleases me to tell you, Mr. Chen Zhen, you are now free. Mitsuko, see you. Chen Zhen. Chen Zhen. Will we see each other again? Chen Zhen. Mitsuko, will you go to China with me? Let me go. Stop. Who?
