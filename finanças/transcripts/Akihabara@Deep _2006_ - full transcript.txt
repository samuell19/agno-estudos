No matter what answer I receive Living is about seeking something A good life requires a good search My sweet hometown. My sweet hometown. Akihabara. In this 0.5 square kilometer area... ...exists the world's biggest and best electric market. This place is a living museum of the post war Japan's technology. A giant black market full of worldwide imitations and junk items. We can only survive in this territory. We're each little chips. Page Programmer Yearly Wage 2,200,000 yen Hello? Page, you awake? It begins at midnight. Taico/Box PC Repair Yearly Wage/Web Designer Wage 2,100,000 yen/2,300,000 yen Taico/Box PC Repair Yearly Wage/Web Designer Wage 2,100,000 yen/2,300,000 yen Hey Taico/Box PC Repair Yearly Wage/Web Designer Wage 2,100,000 yen/2,300,000 yen You're late! S-s-s-s... We get it! Let's go. Alright. This is the last Swinging Penguin. This is a two hour wait. Oh well. Shall we enter from the side? Digital Capital Headquarters Alright, this way. Let's go. His sensibilities are terrible. What? Nakagomi Takeshi Digital Capital CEO Watarai Fujiko Vice President and Secretary/SS Captain There she is! Captain Fujiko! Sexy! He's way too cocky, having his own bodyguard. Everyone! Welcome to Akihabara at night, to the kingdom of DigiCapi! He acts like the king. Well, isn't he Akiba's king? He's 7th richest in the world. I dunno. He acts like Japan's Bill Gates, but... ...but the rumor is he's just a stock market millionaire. Swinging Penguin limited version. Selling at midnight before the rest of the world! Start! Start! Ah! Taico! Everyone! AKIHABARA@DEEP Grand Cosplay CAFE Akanechin This really sucks. T-t-this way. One, two! Taico has too many bugs and is too heavy. Master, happy birthday! Akira Freeter//Fighter Yearly Wage 3 million yen She maybe #1 in popularity... ...but she's just an otaku idol at best. It's easier to get a life size Ayanami Rei figure. Welcome back, Masters. Have you decided on your order? Ummm... Kelp tea and two isobumaki sets. Th... Three, right, Masters. Taico-sama is experiencing another freeze? What lovely obsessive compulsive goods. Don't touch... Hey... Can you move back a bit? This far? A bit more. This far I wonder? Bit more. Right there. For appreciating things, this is the best distance. W-w-w-w... It isn't a waste. Even if she's pretty, under that foundation hides sweat. If ignored, hair will sprout out. Thinking about that makes me feel gross. Body warmth, smell, excretions, saliva all a bother. Hey I'm hard at work. If you tease me I'm gonna drop you. Hey. Are you listening? What do you find gross about me? I bugged out again? T-thirty five minutes. That's pretty short. S-s-s... Sasabe-san, this is far enough. I'll take the train back after the sunset. Please be careful. Thank you very much Izumu System Engineer Parents' Yearly Wage 25 billion yen Izumu-kun. I've always thought this. Isn't it hot in that? Yes Even though this is designed for summer, it's very hot. I usually don't go out much. So it's a lot to bear. Just don't go where there's ultraviolet light. Why not use something more light? Fabrics on the market let in a lot of ultraviolet light. With my condition, even a little ultraviolet light will damage my skin. Talking with doctors, laminated materials works best. Oh... This is nice. Full of vending machines. B-b-broken... What a broken down sake dealer. 40 years old. No carpeting. Rent 64,000 yen. They're having us reform it and exterminate the white ants. It has some merit. How much money do you think we have? In these 3 months of doing digital labor all we've made is 80,000. In my case, all I've done is physical labor. Once we get the machines and desks, it'll be all gone. How grim. S-s-spider webs... Don't push! I see. What what? We start here and aim for there. So when will our important equipment arrive? Ajita? That junk item broker Indian? Very risky! His junk is really just junk. Namaste! This is your order. Hey Isn't this bad?! It's fine. It's fine. This vehicle will soon be scrap. I'm not worried about your vehicle! What will we tell the real estate agent? If we take out the vehicle the building might fall over. It's fine. It's fine. I'll leave the vehicle. Not bad. What are you doing?! What is this? There's a mark in the VAIO mark. A VAIO imitation, right? They wrote it as Somy. What's Gell? Mine has Fujityu written. All of these are bootlegs! In the Mac case is an Athlon CPU. The OS is Microsoft. A thoroughbred would be faster, but a computer hybrid is fast enough. Shall we increase the memory? Somehow... This kind of reminds me of when we all first met. This server is like Yui-san. We all were heavy users of Yui's Life Guard. It was an advice site that had cult level popularity. She was a shut-in wrist cutter. Seeking our last salvation we made it to her shelter. Yui-san was like a nun. Selflessly, sincerely she watched over us. We were shunned by society and our families. We became somewhat independent... ...because she saved us. Yui-san died. The site administrator sent that mail 3 months ago. Pleased to meet you. I'm Kyouse Izumu. I'm Yui's Life Guard's administrator. Overdose? Yes. So she just took too many drugs. So it was suicide? Why would Yui-san commit suicide?! You saw her arm didn't you? How pathetic. So the woman who fixed us was a wrist cutting maniac who did drugs. That hurts! If you have something to say... ...then look into a person's eyes and say it! Calm down. Actually, I have a will mail from Yui-san to you all. I'll read it. You are people who can change, so first let's change. You're starting a company, aren't you? Page-san, Box-san, and Taico-san. Yeah. It was Yui-san's recommendation. I want you to let Akira-san join the company too. And... me as well. E-e-everyone. P-p-please open the window. I've been thinking about this. Our site seems a bit lonely with just Akira's idol content. You want to revive Yui's Life Guard, right? Wait a moment. We can't have Yui's Life Guard without Yui, right? We'd be imitators. It wouldn't be an imitation. We have a dummy that's close to the real thing. Right? But it's still far from completion. Put simply, it's artificial intelligence. Yui-san's thinking, her responses... There are tons of thousands of lines of dialog stored in the memory. I want to carry on Yui-san's will. It's not good enough for just us to be saved, right? Yui's Life Guard can still save millions of sorrowful people. I want Yui to eternally live on the sea of the free Net. Alright! I'll be the site's panda to attract customers. Perhaps... ...I'll have a nude showing hair? I'm against it. That'll drive off the A Boy-kun-tachi. Like... more... something bubbling from the heart. I want a new mo-e. Aki... Aki... Fight! The red one is the TBS sports staff, Seidou Hall 2-dan. Pink is a 109 marketer, representing Shuuto. It's a fight between a high level and a low level. Down! I did it! Doctor! Doctor! A-a-a-amazing. T-t-this is l-legal? It wouldn't be a sport if there wasn't a risk. This is a full fledge grappling sport. All the gathered fighters are Tokyo's best. It's a bunch of the favorite cards. You really like it, don't you? Yes. We're lucky to come today. The next main fighter is a shoe-in for the throne. Is Akira that amazing? Akira-chan has power, speed, technique. All Three! Her standing throw is #1 in Tokyo. But... her current opponent was a former Olympic competitor in judo. If she uses her pinning techniques... Out... she'd be out. It's DigiCapi's Nakagomi. Nakagomi-san! Nakagomi! Fujiko-chan is sexy and scary. Watarai Fujiko comes from this fight club too. Was she strong? She was the unbeatable champion. Before she was picked up by Nakagomi's headhunting... She was the police department's #1 female bodyguard. She's a master of Brazilian jujitsu. Oh, that? Karate Backer Dai. A super rare dead stock. On a net auction that's 180,000. W-wig. It's an urban myth. What do you think? Probably a wig. His polish looks really unnatural. But I have to admire it, it looks realistic. No, it's definitely a wig. Yeah, a wig. And now today's main event. An open-weight special match. From the blue corner enters Akiba Akira! Akira-chan! From the red corner enters Kudou Yasuko! What is that? Gives you a bad feeling, right? Blue corner's 107.8 pounds... Representing AKIHABARA@DEEP. Akiba Akira! From the red corner 132 pounds... Kudou Yasuko! Get her, Kudou! Akira! Kudou! You have a chance to attack the nose of a cosplay idol! Break her front teeth! Fight! Come on! Move move! There! Go! Go! Like that! Go! Go! Move move move! Move away! Move away! Don't get taken! Don't get captured! Alright! Alright! Alright! Now! Stop stop stop! Akira! Akira! Nice! Very good! Don't let this get on some weird SM site. Don't worry. So you can look me in the eye and talk through a camera? When you're in the finder, you're two dimensional... I can start masturbating right now. That was dangerous. What are you doing? AKIHABARA@DEEP-san. Y-yes. Nakagomi wishes to pay his respects. Here? Here? Where where where? Here? I was touched! That was amazing! It gave me goose bumps! I heard you were running a Web production. Who's in charge? I-I-I f-fill... I want to put Akira-chan's site on DigiCapi's. What do you think? Umm.. just a word. Right now it's still under construction. Next week our site goes into business with its contents... That's when we're scheduled to open. I see. Of course. I see. I wanted her to be an image character in our upcoming fighting game software. I'll agree, but I have a condition. Hey! Why not? It'll be publicity for our site. Interesting. So your condition is? Let us design the catch copy for the posters. In exchange, I won't ask for any money. If it's free, there's nothing to fear. Then let's do this. DigiCapi will let your site do the advertisement. So our alliance is formalized? O-o-ok... How many members are in AKIHABARA@DEEP? F-f-five people. So each person gets 1 million for a monthly total of 5 million. Every month you'll get paid for the ads. Ok? Ok? Ok? Alright? Alright? I look forward to this. Those guys really understand words! Felt good! Awesome! It's a wig. Without a doubt. I take things straight on. Right before your eyes it's just me. When it's time to decide, one's gotta decide! If I hesitate it may slip past me! I won't avert my eyes. I won't avoid the pain. I'll never give up the hope! I can change starting today. The light shines. Look at me! Men that hit women will not be forgiven! Did you see the ruckus on TV? It's selling out like crazy. Hirai Shinosuke Executive/Head Secretary Going against domestic violence. Truly opposite ideas. Those guys are interesting. A violence game topped with cream that dodges the PTA's spears. I got a deal at 5 million a month. Isn't it better to not overfeed your dog? They have no fangs. We should stop the unsatisfied ants in the company first. Speaking of which, I read it too. The entry in 7-chan. What a laugh. Such frank slander. The internal investigation is progressing. Oh right. For now send a gift of gratitude to AKIHABARA@DEEP. What should I send? Katou Noriyuki Development 4th tier Contract Programmer Katou Noriyuki Development 4th tier Contract Programmer Well... It's a Zaku. Cool! I will follow Nakagomi-san. I'd call him Aniki. What is this plain robot? It wouldn't touch your heart strings, Akira. It's the Zeon Mobile Suit that appears in Mobile Suit Gundam. He could have sent something edible! Like 50 kilos of Matsusaka beef. Sounds nice! I want to eat meat. Oh? Welcome! Delicious! Cooking beef myself... why is it so delicious? Hey, eat more. This is my first time at Korean bbq. It makes me so happy. I always eat alone at home. What about your father and mother? My parents are currently abroad. I was supposed to go with them... But it's a country right under the equator. My mother was very against it. I've lived alone for 4 years already. Welcome! Welcome! I understand how you feel. No one scolds you for skipping school though, right? But I'm not skipping school. But you don't go to high school. When in America, I skipped some grades and graduated high school. To be precise, right now I'm on break from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. You kind of make me feel bad. I'm happy... really. Just eating with you all like this. L-let's talk... "Let's make a brand new search engine." Search engine? I've been thinking this for a while. Isn't there something new that we can do? Don't tell me we 're making one? I'll say this. It's a freaking lot of work to make a search engine. First you need a real big system. And a real big staff. Right. Unless we surpass Yahoo, it's meaningless. We can surpass them. We just need a lure that Yahoo and Google don't have. Yahoo is basically directory style. In other words, it's a big encyclopedia. That's bad for us since we have few staff. And Google is... Index style, right? Right. It's a system that automatically finds things using keywords. The cost of maintaining it is cheap and not dependent on staff numbers. If we do this, it'd be index style. But what'll we do for the originality that Google doesn't have? There is. I was wondering if Izumu's Yui's Life Guard AI program can be used. A search engine that worries with you, that searches with you. That's it! That idea is extremely elegant. An index style search program... ...that learns a person's desires. Right. Just as Yui-san gave each of us advice... It learns a user's preference and habits... It'll be a new search engine that customize itself as it's used. Isn't this epoch-making? Yes... but... But what? A lot of programming must be written. All by myself I couldn't... Are you stupid? What reason are we here for? We've taken the lowest digital work just to eat. I type slow, but if I can help... Then starting tomorrow for 3 months, please give me your time. There's a really hard course... ...or a course so hard you'll die. Which do you want? The course so hard you'll die! D-die... Cheers! Che... DigiCapi's haughty, unfair layoffs are a blemish on democracy! Blemish! A blemish! Blemish! A blemish! Blemish! It's outdated and the class system is nonsense! Bogus dictator Nakagomi Takeshi runs a fascist administration! We will overthrow it! We will! Overthrow it! We will! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! Good morning. It's quite a gathering, isn't it? They are calling themselves Dalit, aren't they? In Hindu it means "a broken people". It's a movement of people who think of themselves as the lowest caste. Nakagomi CEO runs a state of fear... He's the 21st century's Hitler! Hitler! The one yelling at the front is 4th tier development, Shudra. Programmer Katou Ryuki. We have 700 companies connected to us. We need an effective method of managing our staff. They swore obedience to me... Their status won't hold long. Come on. Open up There. Eat up. No good. The search isn't working at all. Hey, for a change of pace let's eat out. Sounds good. Considering everyone's fatigue, Korean bbq would be good for restoring nutrients. Ah. Developed a taste for it? No, not so. I have other accepted options. Let's go for Korean bbq! At this time we should try Ariran's restaurant. But isn't the meat hard there? It's cause you don't chew properly. Alright. Then let's go with Toriyoshi's chicken wings. Don't switch beef for chicken on your own! Then then how about Ueno's kimchi alley? Ueno's far away though. Damn, not a shred of cooporation. Let's vary the character. Let's add 5 types of AI to the search program Multiple personalities for the artificial intelligence? That's interesting. So we five will be the models? F-first... The first AI thinks calmly, a meticulous smart guy. Till he's satisfied, he'll keep reviewing it in his head. For now let's call him "the one who goes in circles". Call him Rounder for now. The second AI is watchful for all the little things around him. A kind fellow. Any information missed will be picked up by this guy. He's the "good neighbor". Let's call him Neighbor. The third is the detestful devil to everyone's angel. He always thinks counter to you. He's never afraid to give an opposing opinion. A lovable heretic. He's the "devil's advocate". Let's call him Opposer. The fourth is an aggressive person, easy to set off. Never afraid to mess up, leaping on an idea. Someone who approaches things positively. Let's call her Jumper. With such individualistic AI's... ...we need someone to bring them together like Page-san. The fifth one is Constructor. He sifts through all the information the others bring for the user. With these 5 individual AI's searching, there's nothing that can't be found. That's it! Our grand plan is set. All five of these AI's need is the ability to learn. Right. The search uses that person's personality, interests, plans. The 5 AI's learn the user's preferences and customize themselves. It'll be a one-of-a-kind search engine that fits only us. It's like Cinderella's slipper. L-l-let's r-r-return to work. Ah, hello. Good work. Toozaka Naoki Digital Capital Executive Chief Creator Toozaka-kun. I'm sorry. I was just taking a dump. Did you properly wash your hands? Eh? Well, right now. Lately there haven't been any stories to excite our companies. Something to shake everyone up. As developers of the legendary file exchange software... Don't we have any secret treasures? No, nothing in particular. What? You should wake up from ur dormancy. Your annual wage is high after all. Right. I've heard a tiny story... What? Tell us! Yesterday I was looking at a site critic's blog. An interesting search engine is going into beta. Ah... you mean Crook? That's it. I saw it! I took a peek. It's good! The guys making it have pretty good sense. Yeah. Something good? So what's this search engine like? It's still under development, but... But I imagine it has an AI function. It's a thinking search engine. I'm just guessing from what's being discussed. But this is... That's right. What? What? What? The search engine is a bit twisted. Welcome back. Master. What are you searching for? Those guys really are interesting. Hello. This is AKIHABARA@DEEP. This site is a link free. So feel free to link it to your individual pages. For business deals, fax or mail us. Send a simple proposal to our contacts. So, have a good search, and a good life. This is Digital Capital's Watarai. Our CEO would like to invite you to his home. Would next Friday be good for you schedule? We will be waiting for your call back. This is amazing! Let's go. Right. Let's go. Let's go. I wonder what kind of collection Nakagomi-san has. There's a rumor he has all the figures for the commanders in "Romance of the Three Kingdoms". Lovely. I'm not going. Even if he's rich, I don't want to go to some middle-aged otaku's house. Unfortunately, on Friday I have my regular checkup. What about you, Page? You're going, right? Y-yeah. I stop here. Come up! Let's eat. What do you think? It's delicious. This red wine is also to die for. It's easy to pick good wine. Half-ass wine going for just 10-20,000 won't be very good. But ridiculously expensive wine is always delicious. The world's market price doesn't lie. By the way... How much is this wine? John Huston is about 150,000. AKIHABARA@DEEP is like this wine. Your market price is really high. Definitely a worthy buy. That's why I want you guys. W-w-what you want... ...i-isn't us... ...i-it's C-Crook. I want t Change cheque to check.o establish a friendly relation. What I want is your talent. I want to invest in you. To buy you all up. Of course your new search engine would be included. Right now Crook is estimated to be worth 2 billion. Split up among you five it's 400 million each. Think of it like contract money. Here's a check for that sum. If you accept this, I'll pay you right now. Umm... in that situation... What would happen to AKIHABARA@DEEP? You'd become DigiCapi Group staff. I'll open up one floor in this building for you guys. I'd prepare three excellent assistants for each of you. Of course I'd offer the latest and best machines. If you don't want to be a member, I don't mind being equal partners. If you agree to give me half the copyright, I'll invest one billion. You can set up a castle somewhere. Right now none of the major sites are made in Japan. Once the world goes broadband... Japan will disappear off the world's map. You understand this theory, right? I also think so. That's why we need Crook. Analysts predict in five years it'll make at least 40 billion. In that situation, you'd get 20 billion. Yay! Twenty billion... U-umm... So you plan to charge a fee to use it? Crook is killer content on the level of the World Cup or Academy Awards. We'll take a bit of money as the world pushes its way here. Right now the Crook prototype is free for everyone to use. I want to keep it open this way. I don't understand... Before Nakagomi-san paid us for our ads, we were in the lower 2 million a year. That's why I felt so happy to find free and good contents. It allowed us to swim freely. We owe the sea of the Net a debt. You're good guys. That's why I want to protect you guys. Crook will eventually be pirated by someone. And it'll be released into the sea of the Net. My patent will protect your legitimate Crook. Page. Nakagomi-san is an amazing person. I don't mind following him. He has charisma over us. Alright, as a special treat today... I'll show you my secret pet. It's okay. She's under contract and is working here. She's ... working? Yes. It's a week-long contract. Every week my staff does an interview. And sneaks them here. The freeter girls are glad to make 500,000. But the flaw is they only last a week. They eat and excrete all in this room. For me, I'd want to see a more broken process. If an accident occurred, my secretary would stab me with her nails. This is her sixth day. It's dissolving in well. The throw up prince is awake. I wonder how much that throw up is converted to money? B-B-Box. Thanks. We aren't the same as Nakagomi. I'm scared of going with him. I don't think I can go with him. No disagreement! You sure? it's 400 million each. If it goes well each one will get 5 billion. I'm plenty happy with my 2 million a year. 7-channel's criticism of DigiCapi is very interesting. The company's internal caste system is scary if it's real. What is that? From the top are the Priests, Nobility, Commoner regular employees... Of the group's 10,000 people they make up only ten percent. The other 90% are contract employees. In the company there is a slave level called Shudra. They're dismissed after a project. They're seasonal workers. A miser using the welfare program, eh? I know because I used to be a hacker. DigiCapi has had a bad reputation of coercing various Net groups. Their methods are high-handed. Crook would surely be trapped in a toll broadband site. That's why I think we should flat out refuse. I think the ad money will stop... ...everyone, please hold on for now. I see! So that would stop too... Today was really enjoyable. It seems Box-kun drank a bit too much. By the way, next Friday our company is having a party for Girls Battle Park being a hit. Will you come? I think the catering's food will be good. I'd be pleased to see your faces at lunch. Everyone. Nakagomi CEO has some kind of surprise speech for you all. Go ahead! Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to my young friends. They're dangerous guys that are making an uproar in the IT underground. It's the member of AKIHABARA@DEEP! Everyone, can you please come over here? As you know, they're related to the ads for the Girls Battle Park. Our DigiCapi is going to do a joint business monopoly with them. Future-wise, what we are making together... ...is content that will revolutionize our broadbrand services. No objections, right, Page-kun? W-we... ...w-want to make... ...i-it f-f-free for e-e-everyone... ...t-t-to be f-free to use... ...usable c-c-content. A-AKIHABARA@DEEP is... Digi...DigiCapi... The m-monopoly c-contract... ...w-we don't plan to sign it! Looks like I got ahead of myself. Looks like there's still a lot for us to talk about. ...but I think they're not sure about their decision. Don't fuck with me. What the hell is this?! Your house was burglarized too, Page? Really? Just what is this? Mou... Hello? P... Page, are you listening? It's a call from Taico. Hello? Page, I was burglarized! How cruel. It's unbelievable! My room is a mess! Hello? Box-san, did a burglar hit you? Don't tell me they got your home too?! It was a probably a pro. And they were organized. Well, this is my first time on such a case. For 32 homes to be burglarized at the same time. A serial burglary at the same time?! Eleven cases in our jurisdiction. It's camouflage! They wouldn't hit all our homes and office at the same time! The otaku-tachi were marked. You normally act in a group, right? Such guys are easiest to target. So it was six personal computers stolen. And 12 peripherals. That's it? There's important data on the server. It's not just a peripheral! Intellectual property, right? But we can only judge physical losses. Fill out a damage report at each of the police stations in your area. Hey! It's clear stealing the data was the goal! Well, that's it for us. We have to go to the next crime scene. Come on, everyone. Withdraw. You guys really are useless. Boy! That's not how you address the police. So... pardon me. But we know Nakagomi did this. But we don't have any proof. Everyone, good work. Good work. The next demonstration is Saturday next week. For details please check the usual bulletin board. Okay, split off! Let go! Japan's communication companies and computer makes sites... ...are in no shape for taking on the world. So what we need to do is counter them. And create Japan's first major site. Then we'll make an impact on the people. And a new Net age will be made. We are already ready for that. So, Nakagomi-san, the new content is a new search engine, isn't it? Hey! Oh? Hey! It's still under development and top secret! That's right. Eh. Where did you get that information? You leaked it out yourself. Yes, well... A trial product is already done. A copyright application has been submitted. Expecting to go on sale in October, DigiCapi's technology troops... ...are putting all their efforts into bringing it to final adjustment stages. We'll have an annoucement meeting for it next week, look forward to it. This one? Everyone will be surprised... I... ...can't just accept this situation as it is. We have no chance of beating DigiCapi in court. A court battle would take years. They're going to do minor changes to our Crook, and in two months... ...it'll be sold as DigiCapi's search engine. So we should just redo our original. Nakagomi's copyright will come down first. As long as the AI functions are similar... ... we'll lose to the copyright holder. So there's nothing we can do?! Page! You're the leader, right?! Say something! We have dreams and we have pride too! You did this?! Stop there! ...if this woman is okay. Put your life in my hands. Put your life in my hands. I also lie to live. I also drink sake to live. Although I have no intention of pouting. If this woman is okay. Put your life in my hands. Die! Killing our boss isn't enough! Life... Yo, Page. Have some curry? Mouse-kun, right? I-Icon-sa-san? Long time no see. Or rather... this is the first we've met. Despite the fact that two of us hacked so many computers. How ironic it is that we are now enemies. It's too bad about Crook. Y-you k-knew? Despite my appearances, I'm one of DigiCapi's executives. Umm... C-c-cyber... DigiCapi's security is the best in the world. A cyber attack would have no effect. It's 100 percent impossible. Just... It isn't like it's impossible. I'll help you as much as I can. What? Does it sound so good that you have to look so suspicious? Come with me. And you too, girl, if you don't mind. He's the resistance person who wrote to 7-chan? A cerebral contusion has caused him to remain unconscious. If it's bad, the doctors say he'll be this way the rest of his life. A-a-a comrade? No... Just a lover. I cannot forgive Nakagomi for doing this analog thing. He's different from us. He's no otaku. He's very charismatic to the young guys, but... But when cornered, he easily does a power play. Like with the Crook situation. But I'll help as long as I don't have to bear any risk. I know how terrible Nakagomi can be, after all. I've copied DigiCapi's blueprints here. SCHOP's development project is on floor 22. It's in the most well guarded A block. What is SCHOP? DigiCapi's new name for Crook. They're afraid of it getting out, so no copies are made. Take advantage of Nakagomi's carefulness. All you need to do is destroy the original. At any rate, all the data is on the disk in A block. It's a completely closed network. It's impossible to access it from outside. But if you break in... If you break the password that's changed every day, you log in. Unfortunately, I'm not a project member so I don't know the password. But it should be easy for genius hacker Mouse-kun. In other words, we have to break in? An analog robbery requires an analog rescue. You understand, right? There are around 50 guards. But they're just small fish from some security firm. If you don't finish before the ruckus reaches the secret service, you're out. It's near impossible. An ID is n-needed. Borrow mine. Right now I have to nurse him. Ah! I was just kidding! Sorry sorry! I get it. I get it! W-wait! Stop it! I really get it! I didn't mean it! Hey! That hurts! Isn't that overdoing it?! We heard from Akira. Why are you meeting Toozaka from DigiCapi in secret? You didn't even tell us. Isn't that a bit standoffish? To be frank, I'm against putting myself in danger. But I'm more against being left outside the mosquito net! W-w-will you open the window? We're going to take Crook back from Nakagomi. It's impossible to do hacking without getting our hands dirty. That's why we have to break in and physically retrieve it. There's a good chance that we'll fail. I don't know how it'd feel to be caught by the police... But I'm willing to risk it. Akira and I will do it, everyone else... That's bullshit! That's bullshit! Bullshit! That's bullshit... Yeah... that's bullshit. Please don't joke. Don't leave me behind. I don't want... I don't want to be alone anymore. I-I understand. N-number one... U-u-using our ways... ...w-we'll fight. Are U ready? Blow away the depression. In this sleepless city. Let it beat! Let it beat! Let it beat! I want to keep ringing! Dreamin'. Link to the passion. I want to burn in this second! Moving on! SCHOP Coming soon. That's pretty good. How's the media reacting? Most are reacting favorably. But some magazines think the connection to Crook's disappearance is suspicious. All we need to do is finish first and get the copyright, and we win. What about those guys watching @DEEP? I'll give that report afterwards. Then on to the B type. It's damp. Dirty... Hey, can you bring it to the second floor? I can't become someone else. I'm just myself. The freedom I keep searching for... I strongly embrace! Are U ready? Blow away the depression! In this sleepless city... Let it beat! I want to keep ringing! Dreamin' Are U ready? Someday goin' my way! Link to the passion! In this second I want to burn! Moving on! I wanna break up the wall, now! Okay! I had Hirai do some checking. Those @DEEP guys are acting in secret again. I wonder if they don't learn. I'd rather not have to resort to any more violence. Katou's incident is enough. Hirai-san's methods are too simple and dangerous. Someday it'll fail him. Is that a shred of honor as a former cop? I no longer have such things. Then... Shall we go to a fair? What do you think? Why not fight that Akira girl in the ring? Me? I can easily buy a fight card using money. Seems that domestic violence caused her to stab her stepfather. So she was put on probation. Seems she started fighting then. Kind of like your trauma? I want to see who's stronger. I can't say you have very good taste. Yeah. I have bad taste, don't I? Speaking of bad taste, I need another favor. It seems she took too many drugs. And ended up like this. She won't die, right? What are you up to? Don't know. Scared? Why should I be afraid? Don't act tough, hurry and tap out. If you don't I'll break a bone. Your leg or arm... which do you prefer? Don't bullshit. Round one! Fight! Akira! We can't torture you if you faint so quickly. How about this? V-v-violence... ...p-please stop... Then talk. I'm getting tired of hitting you. N-nothing... ...t-t-to s-s-say... How irritating! Hurry and tap out. I don't want to do anything senseless. Don't think badly of me. Hurry and tap out. Nakagomi is watching. It's a powerful truth serum, but... ... there are few side effects, don't worry. No! Stop! No! Stop it! If you squirm the needle will break! Hold him down! Taico! The l-li... ...li-light... look! Shut up! What happened? What happened to him? Did it. Shut up! Learn to talk! Are you really human? Learn to talk! Learn to talk! I... ...h-have... ...n-n-nothing... m-more... ...t-t-to- s-s-say! T-t-take t-that... 1 month later You okay? This is a bit loose. How's the dislocation? It's no problem. The CCD camera on the helmet... ...is all recorded on the DV tape in the chest. This is important evidence. The fist stun gun occurs upon the punch impact... Squeeze the switch in your hand and it goes on. The power setting is set so normal humans will stop moving. There's a lithium battery in the chest, it's a bit heavy, but please endure. Just to be safe, I made the armor thick. Be careful of shocks. Lookin' cool! Here we go. Okay. One, two! I skimmed Toozaka-san's ID... ...and created an almighty copy. You can enter everywhere except the crucial A block. What about Nakagomi's penthouse? Unfortunately, only certified people are allowed in there. Damn it! Fifteen minutes after the alarm, the guard's reinforcements will arrive. In seventeen minutes the police will arrive. Finish the mission in that time, please. Okay? We are Dalit! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! Hey, you guys! You guys free?! We're not free! Are you satisfied?! We're not satisfied! The let's go, those of you who aren't! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! With SCHOP going on sale tomorrow, they know it's an important day for DigiCapi. Katou, whom you tried to destory, is their leading flag, isn't he? Why today? Why not tomorrow? Good morning. Hello. The front sure is a mess, isn't it? I'm sorry for the bother. W-wait! You guys, where are you going? Wait! W-w-wait right there. I know. Answer me. L-later. Do what later? This is central surveillance. We just arrived on floor twelve. Roger. Hey! It's those @DEEP guys. Right? If you continue, in the center of the hall go right. There should be the High Priests' elevator. Roger! All elevators to floor 12 have been stopped. Roger. Okay, to all Dalit-san, please advance. Katou here. Affirmative. Forward! Dalit goes! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! We are Dalit! It sure is quiet. Akira. Being hit by others... ...doesn't hurt as much as I thought. This is floor 22. We've arrived on floor 22. Roger. Right leg? Or left leg? Or both of them? Let's go. Hey, want to take those guys? You serious? We won't know until we try. This for real? Jet Stream Attack! O-open. I-it's open. Box... Go on ahead! I think my leg's broken. This way! T-that's it. What's wrong? C-Crook's not here. Enter Virus Akira... w-we're going up. H-hurry. You! I've stopped. I'm no longer an employee. I have no obligation to protect that man. Adults don't work without a reward. Go already. I just have one request. W-what is it? The pet girl... Let her go. O-okay. Why didn't you break my arm that time? Because I can't hate a girl like you. You came to take this back, right? Okay, I'll return it. I have one final question. Why do you care so much about the freedom of the Net? Humans are creatures that place territories even on the sea. And the sea of the Net weas orginally created by humans. It's a piece of property to be fought over. Y-y-you... ...a-are an o-old-fashioned human, aren't you? T-t-trying to possess the sea of the Net... N-no one can do that. Because... That is... ...a s-sea i-in each of o-our h-heads... A-Akira! Do what you want. Oishi Kuranosuke = Leader of the 47 Ronin You're Oishi Kuranosuke after all. Kira Kouzukenosuke = Enemy of the 47 Ronin D-do you know what happened to Kira Kou-Kouzukenosuke? Don't tell me you want to take my head? Yes... Page! You did it, didn't you?! You did it, didn't you? Good work. L-let's go. @DEEP! @DEEP! @DEEP! @DEEP! @DEEP! @DEEP! @DEEP! @DEEP! @DEEP! @DEEP!
