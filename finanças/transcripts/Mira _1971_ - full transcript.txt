Warm, eh? It will be much easier once the bridge is there. The bridge? What bridge? I've heard that there will be a bridge over the Scheldt. A lot of water will still flow by before that happens. But I've heard it. If that's true, I'll throw you in the water. Here. Tell your bridge builders that they'll have to deal with me, the deacon of Waterhoek. With Deacon Broeke! There they are. I see them. -Really? -Already? Yes, I see them there. I see them. Come and look. They are early this year. Come, Mother. Father is here. There they are. Give me that. That's from Father. Come on, Mother. Sieper is here. There they are. Father! There they are. I see all of them. I see Sieper. Sieper leads the way. Damn, it's true. It's time. They're already here. -Will our Jules be there? -Absolutely. And he's drunk as hell. He'll know all about it. Daddy. Jenny, come. How are you? -There you are. -Yes, Father. -Welcome home. -I'm glad we're here. We've been on the road for nine hours. The train was stopped in Lille. -Aren't you hungry? -Hello, Sieper, my boy. -I think he's more thirsty. -You could say that again. I'll buy the first round. Do you hear that? Spikkerelle buys first. That is also a first. -He's surely broken into a donation box. -Don't put ideas in his head. -I wouldn't put it past him, either. -Indeed. Hey, Spikkerelle. One for me as well. A double. Just give me a drink. -Can we settle up? -Sit down. You're not selling me short, are you? Bastard. That's mine. Why don't you work like mad for four months? They will just spend it. -As if we don't work. -All right. My Jefke. How big have you've become. Can you read yet? The sister is at the school gates. The meadows are green. Bravo, Jefke. You'll become an office manager at this rate. -I'm still waiting for my pay. -Yes, later. -How was it? -Same as usual. Thank you. Racing and working ourselves to the bone. But we made it through. -So you are happy to be home? -Definitely. -Didn't have any problems? -No. Yes, with Franske there. He started off being pretty lazy. But I soon whipped him into shape. Hey, Sieper, have you heard about the bridge? -Are they still talking about that? -They've just started. Let them talk. Saying is one thing, doing another. Yes, but it's been discussed in the city council. That's serious. That means people in the village want to make money at our expense. At the expense of Waterhoek. But that won't happen. Say, Sieper, the surveyors have also been there. -Where? -On the Scheldt. -Have they measured anything? -We chased them all off. I threw stones and peat at them until they left. Isn't that so, guys? True. Snoeke has chased them off by himself and we just stood there. -That may get you into trouble. -We are in the right. They come here to harass us on our own land. We don't need a bridge. It's fine the way it is. We've never had a bridge before and were fine. They should leave us. Well said. They want to drive us off our land, the bastards. Waterhoek is ours. If idiots in Brussels or the town council think they can do whatever they want and destroy our Waterhoek with their bridge, they are wrong. The costs have already been calculated. -And do we get any of that money? -Not a franc. Speculation at our expense. As long as I live, there won't be a bridge here. We will show them who lives in Waterhoek. Give the constable another drink. Give me another one, too. Give all of them another one. May they all drown in the Scheldt. -It's all scheming and politics. -We'll teach them a lesson. Come on, now. Bye. Bye. -Please. You'll wake the kids. -Yeah, all right. Hello, Treute, my boy. How are you? Yeah? Come on, leave him alone. -A cup of coffee? -Yeah, why not? That does me good. Yeah. We've had problems. You have no idea. They made us do all the dirty chores the French wouldn't do. For the Flemish. And if you don't like it, you can leave. And you can't do anything about it. And what can you do about it? -Grin and bear it. -Just forget it. You're home now. Yeah, you're right. Well, well, well. -Look who's here. -Hello, uncle. Don't I get a kiss? But of course, uncle. So you came back. You don't have to hide. Show yourself. You're not ashamed of me, are you? Stop it, Sieper, take it easy. And you, slut. Off to bed. -How long have you been away? -A year and two months. And all this time in Paris. Paris, toujours l'amour. I say, uncle. -Don't you hear what I'm saying? -Do I have to stand up? She's becoming more like her mother. Not a word about her mother as long as I'm in charge. She's gone forever. And we'll take care of Mira, what she's left behind. But not a word about it. -Don't get so angry. -Angry? Angry about her? She disgraces our whole family. She stays away full nights with all the men in the neighborhood. What are we doing about it? There is nothing you can do about it. That's nature, what can you expect? Why did she come back? She didn't bring a souvenir like her mother, did she? She knows the tricks to prevent it. We will never know what she's learned in France. -Just give me another drink. -No, it's too late. We're going to sleep. All right, then. That's for the best. -What is it? -I haven't eaten yet. I'm hungry. If you're angry at me, why do you hit him? Annoying, isn't it? Charlatans. Come and say hello. Shouldn't you measure on our side as well? Come over here. The gendarmes shit themselves with fear. Straighter. One forty-three. -We will measure you sometime. -Come here, or are you afraid? -If they don't behave, I'll go over. -Calmer. Be calm. I'm itching to deal with them. -Hey, Cies. -Yes? If you don't calm down your people, things might get rough. -Come on, Cies, calm us down. -You're asking for it. -I'm serious. -Do not be stupid. You might not like to hear this, but still I think that a bridge like that might not be such a bad idea. What do you mean? I understand you're against that bridge, but you must look at it from both sides. There are no two sides here. All I know is that they'll not only build a bridge through our Waterhoek, but also a big road, and that they'll tear down our houses and that strange people will rule over us. If that's what you want, say it. Say it, what is the other side of the matter? -Well-- -Say it, Sieper. What? For a start, we'd get jobs here, right at our doorstep. We'll no longer have to go to France and have ourselves tortured abroad. -Work on the bridge? -Are you serious, Sieper? -Think about it. -Why should we think about that? Look there. They've come to invade Waterhoek with gendarmes. They're ready with guns and you want to think about it? We are no match for the big shots. There's a lot of money involved. They decide what happens and that's that. Has it ever been different? Would you listen to him? Do you want to hide behind your wife? If we don't do it, others, strangers, will. Men like them will come here with their urban manners. As long as I'm the deacon, nobody touches the Scheldt. And the first man to help build the bridge, I'll bash his head in! Hello, men. How are things here at Waterhoek? Hey, Broeke, the notary is asking how things are going. Bad, Mr. Notary, as you know all too well. Do you mean the bridge? That will soon come to light. You're such a troublemaker. Don't make such a fuss. Well, men. Bye. You cannot say that we did not warn you. Come on, Broeke, don't be silly. Hello, Uncle Lander. Mother, Uncle Lander is here. Hey, Lander. -Hello, Manse. -Hello, brother. Goodness me, you have become so skinny. -Don't they feed you in the army? -They do. But you do lose weight from all those exercises. -I'm glad you're back home. -Me too, Father. All that's going on. Have you heard about the bridge? -Let him rest a bit first, Father. -You will be shocked. Let him eat. And don't start complaining about Sieper again. -Sieper? What's happened? -You won't believe what he did. He declared in front of everyone that the bridge is a good idea. -Did he say that? -Yes, he did. He's a coward, that Sieper. What? Did she come back? She did. Ill weeds grow apace. Uncle Lander is here. Hey, come here. Uncle Lander. Hello, Mira. Nobody told me about this. Or wrote to me about it. Here I am. Twice. French style. Lander, come here. -We still have lots to discuss. -At once, Father. -And you, go tend to the sheep. -At once, Grandfather. And don't laugh, you ninny. You're not in Paris. -Why are you so mean to her? -She's possessed by the devil. -Oh, come on. -Three boyfriends in two months. -Heaven knows where she got that from. -From you. -I'm going to play cards. -Don't come home too late. -How long to go? -A while. Not too long. Come with me. Well, tell me something. -You must tell me. -Me? I have nothing to say. -What did you have to do in the army? -Clean cannons. And do drills in the sand and in the mud. And at night? Go to the cafes. If we were allowed to go. You've become beautiful. The last time I saw you, you were still a girl. Skinny. -The thought already crossed my mind then. -What thought? -This will become a beautiful woman. -What else? She might suit me when I get back from the army. You've probably made many women lose their minds. Me? -I can see it in your eyes. -And what about you? What about me? What have you been up to in France? I'd rather not talk about that. You're right. I won't be a minute. Wait here. Isn't it a beauty? -It won't last long. -Why not? -It's a male, right? -Right, and they're the first to go. I am going to eat you. Keep working, Lander. Swim. Come on, swim. There is only one Lander. And that's you. And only one you, Mira. Mira! Mira, aren't you ashamed? Where everyone can see it. What is it? You slut. With your own uncle, no less. Is it because courtship is over for you? Scandalous. Get out of here. Well, we're going. If it's not allowed here, we'll do it elsewhere. Not under my roof! This is what the road's width will be. Six meters. Then level up with five meters of sand for the base. Yes, there will do. He's making a fool of us. He won't even look at us. Joker. -Assholes. -Bastards. -Crooks. -Jokers. That will teach you. Are you going to stop now? We've come here to do our job. -Or should we bring the gendarmerie? -Yes, bring them with you. -Listen to him. -Do you want trouble? Men, we're done for today. I've built six bridges, but I've given plenty more men a black eye. Show-off. And the law is on our side, don't you forget that. You can't stop the law. Come on, faster. -Come on, guys. -Faster. If I had been there, I would have let him have it. Sure. -You'd rather let Mira have it. -Indeed. Look over there. Townies. What can I get you, Mr. Maurice? A drink? Yes, please. -Hello, gentlemen. -Two drinks, please. Ratje, two gins, please. -The gentlemen aren't from around here. -No. -Are you associated with the bridge? -Yes. -You too, sir? -Yes, I'm the engineer. Well, well, the bigwig of it all. And you? Who are you? -Me? -Yes, you. I am Lander, the son of Broeke, deacon of the Waterhoek. -And what's your name, engineer? -Maurice Rondeau. Won't you treat us, Mr. Maurice? Yes, for it's the first time that you've come to the Meersblomme. But of course, why not? Ratje, a round from Mr. Maurice. -Well, cheers. -Cheers. There you go. -You're not used to that, are you? -Distilled it myself. That burns your soul. Here, pay with this. See you all. -Wait a minute, I'll go with you. -No, don't bother. -Is he your type? -He looked very serious. Yeah, as serious as a heart attack. Why are you always bothering visitors to Waterhoek? You're the one who's bothering us. Listen, that bridge is coming regardless. It's for your own good. -The whole region is being modernized. -Get out of here. Then that's your choice. But Mr. Maurice, you're soaking wet. You'll catch a cold. Go sit by the fire. -Good evening. -Good evening. And Mr. Maurice, are you playing with us? No, thank you. -Damn. -Now what? -Wait. -Quiet. What? Want to stay behind or do you want to go back home? -No. -Then be quiet. -Damn, there they are. -Not for much longer. -You're here early, too. -And you. Yes. -Hey, big shot. -What is it, man? I'm greeting you, sir. Greetings to you, too. Bastards! Get out of here. Get out of our boat. Come here. -Bastards. -You bigwigs. Here, bastard. -Here. -Damn Bastard. -Come here. -No. Tette, where are you? Tette. Quiet. We need to find those guys first. I punched him in the stomach. He must have drowned. That fat one, too. He sank like a stone. -Come on, Lander, let's go. It's done. -No, we have to be sure. You can't see a thing with this fog. Damn. -Do you see anything? -No. Tette. -Do you see them? -No, I don't see anything. Listen. No, it's here. Do you hear anything? Over there. There he is, the bastard. Tette, we have one. Come. I haven't wronged you, have I? -And now? What now? -Now the others, what did you think? Over here. Come here, I hear something. Now I don't hear anything anymore. Are you fishing for eel or what? -What about it? -What are you doing here? I want to go to the other side. -Won't see much of the sun today. -No. There you are. Shouldn't I pay? -When are you coming back? -We shall see. Maybe tomorrow. -They can't hurt me anyway. -You could stay here. No. It's safest to stay away for a while. You never know. Come and look, the gendarmes are here. -Gentlemen, has something happened? -Everyone come outside. Come on, you. Go outside. Go outside. -Where's your son Lander? -Why? -My brother is innocent. -He's not here. -Where is he? -That's your problem. Find out for yourself. What gives you the right to bother people in their own homes? And why? -You know why. -I don't know anything. -Mom, he's hitting me. -Could you please leave them alone? If you want Lander, you must enclose the forest. -Or you can search in France. -Be quiet, all of you. Listen. I'm listening but I can't hear anything. -Listen to the examining magistrate. -Why? -He has no power here. -The first to open his mouth, will be taken into custody immediately. He is innocent, I say. -He's not a murderer. -So you're the mother of one of them? Your bastard of a son tried to kill me. -Sir, calm down. -Dirty bitch. -What do you have to say? -Nothing, leave her alone. I am the deacon of Waterhoek, speak to me. -Shut up or we'll lock you up, too. -We'll see about that. Why don't you try it? The other one also fled. Hip, hip, hip, hooray. That's enough. People of the Waterhoek, you need to stop mocking the law of Belgium. Understood? That is why I ask you in all seriousness: Where are they? You, with the red hair, when did you last see those killers? Me? I don't know any killers. Well then, as you wish. But don't you understand that this is a double murder? -And that it is our duty-- -Then do your duty and go find them. What did you say there? -Did you say something, little guy? -I am speaking clearly enough, right? I say you are paid well enough by the state to do your job. -So do your job and leave. -Come along, you. -Don't take that! -Aren't you forgetting where you are? -What are we going to do, Broeke? -Shall we get them? That depends on the magistrate. Folks, you heard it. We'll ensure compliance with the law. And don't think you're superior because you're from Waterhoek. We'll end it, understood? Lo and behold. -Lo and behold. -You stay here. Van Daele and Kozijns. Kozijns, you go to the clock. Julie and Sassens, go to the inn. Cyriel, is that you? Cyriel? I immediately thought: "That can only be Cyriel." -How are you? -It's Wednesday. -No, Cyriel, Tuesday. -Thanks. -Do you have anything to eat? -No, we're fasting. -You haven't prayed. -No. Get started. -Which prayer? -A Hail Mary. That's better. Do you want my double-barreled gun? No. Thanks anyway, Cyriel. -Have you seen the others in the woods? -Yes. Tette, at the crossing. He was sitting under an oak tree. If I'd wanted to, I could've shot him just like that. And those gendarmes must think that we are in France. -You've done something bad, Lander. -I know that. I've been a fool. But it taught those jokers a lesson. The scoundrels. They bring us nothing but trouble and they-- Damn it, they're here. Get out of here. That way. -Thanks, Cyriel. -I'm doing it for Mira. Have you had visitors? -Have you seen Lander Broeke? -No. -We'll come and have a look inside. -No one comes in here. -Do you want to battle it out, Cyriel? -Yes, if we must. -Then you have something to hide. -It's Wednesday today. -Do you have a glass of beer for me? -Of course. Come on in. Damn it. There he goes. Are you nuts? Just you wait, Cyriel. You will pay for this. Damn. What do you take us for? We'll teach you a lesson, you murderer. Scumbag. Damn. -That's enough. -Tie him up. He's bleeding from his eyes. Come on, come along. Come on, is it still not clear? -You've got him. -He gave us a lot of trouble. They let him have it badly, the pigs. Give me a drink too. Drink from the tap. His girlfriend is there, too. Come a little closer. You won't see him for a while. Mira. Yes, Lander. -We won't see each other for a long time. -I think so, too. Give him a quick kiss. -Mira. -Yes, Lander? -I'm busted. -Yes, Lander. Let's go. We'll lock him up in the police station of the village. A beer, no foam. -Is everyone here? -I think so, Mr. Notary. Well, let's get started right away, as I have little time. You know the land along the new road will be divided into parcels, which will fall under the law of public utility. That means your land will be valued by serious appraisers and that you'll get that amount. Which means that instead of an old slum you'll get a brand new house that's worth three times as much. And what if they undervalue it by three times? And how can they estimate my costs? -You will understand in a minute. -Please. -But we'll still be out on the street. -These changes benefit Waterhoek. They benefit all of you. Our beautiful village is being destroyed. Look. You can read maps, right? This is the Scheldt. The bridge is here and these are the parcels. And all those strangers who'll come to live here? -Who will profit from this once again? -What are you saying? Jules, give everyone another drink. I'll keep it short. Those of you who, before they're parceled out legally, want to do good business and those of you who want to buy or sell, know where to find me. You know where I live. Cheers. I'll leave the map here so you can all have a look. An honest and serious proposal, out in the open, for everyone to see. -Can we sleep on it one more night? -Yes, but don't wait too long. Sleep? Look what I'll do with that map of yours. That was an official document. Now you can't even wipe your ass with it. If you don't want to listen to someone who wants to help, -who'll get you out of poverty-- -Who is poor here? -All of you. -And you're going to make us rich? -Not rich, but better off. -But you even better off. -Now listen. -Yes, what is it? We don't have to involve you, but then you won't earn anything from it. -And those against it will have it coming. -You have to learn to live like humans -and not like-- -Like what, Mr. Notary? -Like animals. -I wanted to hear that. We are animals. Then we will treat you like animals. Come on, Jef, grab him. Take off his pants. Murderers. I'll give you 50 francs for my pants. Animals, that's what you are. Don't come back or we'll throw you in the Scheldt as well. Let me see. What an ugly thing. When he flies into your hair, you go crazy within a year. -Just like mouse feet. -Come on, let's take him. -Grandfather! -Grandfather! Look, a bat in front of the cowshed. He's still alive, look. Get me three tacks, fool. Will he bring us luck? In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. -Will lightning never strike again? -No. Boys, dinner time. Max. You go and look, Max. There, by the willow. Hey, you there, what are you doing here? -I'm on a walk. Get rid of that dog. -Down, Max, down. Come here. You know he'd bite your throat if I tell him to do so? So you're on a walk and not looking for Mira? -Who? -That bastard daughter called Mira. She's not at home. She's never at home. -Father, dinner's ready. -Yes, I'm coming. I don't want to see you again. Don't look for Mira at my house. You're lovesick, aren't you? Just like all the others. -You're out late, Mr. Engineer. -Yes, I was just passing by. -For no reason? -Yes, for no reason. My friend wants to know if you'd like to have a drink with us. -No, I don't have the time. -That's too bad. They said that you might have been looking for me. -Me? Of course not. -Yes, that's what I thought. Really? I bet you only go to a café if it's raining. -That's right. -Well, goodbye then. -Yes, goodbye, ma'am. -Don't you know my name? -I do. Mira. -Yes, Mira. From Mirabel. Bye! Hit the pile on its head Hit the pile on its head -Sieper's got a lot of spirit in him. -The rotten dog. Who would have thought? The whole lot. A bunch of chickens. What do you expect? They earn a good living. They're satisfied. -There are those who want to save. -Save? What for? Don't they have a house and food and clothes? Save money. If they want to imitate the ones from the village and poke each other's eyes out and act like a bigwig. What can you expect? That's progress for you. Can't believe I took that bastard Sieper into my own family. Manse visited Lander and he cried like a baby. Stay out of our family. What should we talk about, then? The wonderful weather? Look at how high the level of the Scheldt is. If it keeps raining for a few more days, they might as well quit. They should stop ramming piles. What do you mean? Help. The dam has broken. Help. The dam has broken. Come here. Hurry up. Help! That was to be expected. The water level was very high. There's someone lying there. Did he fall? What happened? It is unstoppable. All our work has been in vain. They'll say it's my fault. -He's still alive. -Who is it? Do you know him? -Is it someone from Waterhoek? -What? Did he do it on purpose? You have to be a real bastard or possessed by the devil to do that. Those from Waterhoek are all the same. -His breathing is stable. -He'll make it. -There. -He doesn't look so good. -Can you manage on your own? -Yes. All the best. I should kick you to death, get it over with. Dirty bastard. They should break someone like you on the wheel. Your father is here. It's over. I think for the entire winter. No thanks, Marie. -You'd rather drink beer or gin. -No, Mother. Then drink your tea while it's still hot. It will make you sleep well. -Why are you looking at me like that? -Can't I look at you? -You're so nervous. What is it? -Nothing. -Tell me. -It's nothing. -Is it a woman? A girl? -Of course not. Why do you say "of course not"? You're now a man, out there with farmers. Good night, Mother. And now… And now he pecks at your nose. -Slut. -Yes, Grandfather? -Bring me a cup of soup. -Yes, Grandfather. You're sweating again. Shouldn't you go to your suitors? It's getting late. They'll be itching. -I have no suitors. -That's new. I have you. -Slut. -You always say the same thing. I'd like to walk with her as well. Shouldn't you go this way? This one wouldn't have to ask me twice. Then we have to lay those piles on this side as well. Look, Treute. Those are the educated men. The bosses of the bridge. Say hello, Treute. -Hello. -Hello, beautiful boy. And say hello to him, too. That's Mr. Maurice. Hello, Treute. I knew you'd come. -Tonight? -Tonight. You don't have to be scared. I don't have a dog with me. It's full of mosquitoes here. They always come after me. That's because I have sweet blood. What about you? And you have to undress me. Isn't it better like this? I have to go. -Where to? -To the bridge. -Already? -Yes. They'll see me. The workers will see us together. So what? Good morning, Mr. Maurice. You're here early, if I may say so. You may say so. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Good morning. Treute, my boy, she's got him on the hook. The boss of the whole thing. Our Mira. Come on. Good evening, Mr. Maurice. Miss. -What can I help you with, Miss? -We're going to my room. -But I don't know this lady and it's-- -You don't have bad thoughts, do you? But of course not. -The is my fiancée. -That's different. I didn't know that. -Please forgive me. -It's all right. -Aren't you hungry, Mr. Maurice? -I'll eat something at the hotel later. But you have to keep up your strength. A young guy like you should have two whisked eggs each morning. Look at that old fart over there. He's not moving. Just like a stork. A little more polite, please. Right, Mr. Maurice? Isn't the old fart related to you in a way? Bunch of pranksters. I've brought you something. A gift. -Are you sad? -No. Sit up straight. -Is it your mother's? Did you steal it? -No, I bought it in Ghent. -How much did you pay for it? -Probably too much. -How much? -Three thousand francs. That's too much. Don't you like it? What should I do? Whatever you want. -Do you know what's in that box? -What? Another gift. -You have to guess. Take a guess. -A coat. Wrong. I actually didn't dare to enter that store. It was full of women. But eventually I took the plunge. -How beautiful. -Put it on. -Now? -Why not? All right. Turn around. No, face the door. You looked, you cheat. Close your eyes. I will teach you. Here. And now on your knees. Over there. To punish you because you looked. There. And now you have to count to 25. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen If we moored over here, we can tackle that span in no time. -One moment. -Will that work? -It will be over in six weeks. -Indeed, not a day too soon. -Where are you going after that? -To Ypres, to the new road. That's not far. And you, Mr. Maurice? They say that you'll go to Congo in autumn. -Autumn is still far away. Well, bye. -Bye. Oh, yeah. -Have you seen Mira lately? -She comes home sometimes. -Who is she with now? -With someone from Roeselare. A Becue. I'm staying out of it. -Bye. -Bye, Mr. Maurice. -But what do you want me to tell you? -The truth. Whether it's true or not about that wench. That you see her day and night and that your work suffers. -No. Another one, professor? -No, thank you, Maurice. -So nothing about it is true? -No. -You're lying, Maurice. I can tell. -She's not a wench. -I'm going to marry her. -She's already made it that far. -You don't realize what you're saying. -A slut from the street, a foundling. Calm down, Anna. Listen, Maurice. It's a whim. It can happen to anyone. You don't know the world yet. You're on the verge of destroying your future out of folly. -And for whom? For what? -We'll say no more about it. Do whatever you want. Dig your own grave. But you won't get a half franc from me. -Don't get so carried away. -You want me to support that whore? -That's not what it's about. -It is for her. -What do you know about her? -Enough. She can have you, but not the money. -I am of legal age and entitled to it. -Not half a franc. Just get a lawyer. We shall see.
