We're under some pressure in the Yukon and scram on a little bit to find ground. Right now, the main target is on John Reeves' ground. We're spending a lot of money doing drilling, so we need inclusive results. To keep his goldmining empire intact, 27-year-old mine boss Parker Schnabel is determined to expand his operation to Alaska. He's gambled $180,000 to secure a claim, but still doesn't know if it has the gold he needs. The thing about Fairbanks that I really like is it's a big district with millions of ounces of production. They haven't had a huge amount of exploration in the last 10 or 20 years. That's a good sign. After striking out on his first prospect, Parker's heading to the archives to find his next spot. John has a really extensive archive of information from, you know, the early 1900s until Fairbanks Exploration, which was a big company, um, quit the business and John ended up owning it. And he still has all the original maps and drawings, which shows how thoroughly they explored and mined all of the properties that John has. Parker and master driller Liam Ferguson meet with land owner, John Reeves, and son-in-law, Drew Langley, to investigate a potential lead at Cleary Creek. Where a dredge may have left behind virgin ground. This is a block of ground. It's right where the dredge number 3 left off. Um, we're a little unsure why they stopped and turned around and went back the other way. Is there any way you can find us - some of the old drill reports for this cell here? Yup. Not a problem. That'd be 1940. Okay, sounds good. So, for dredge 3. - So this is as they were making that turn. Yeah. This is the corner. Perfect. So this is your treasure map. This is the treasure map. This really gives us a lot of information. It's pretty clear that dredge was on gold here. '39 took out over 30,000 ounces. 30,000 ounces. In dredge 3 in 1939. That's right along here. - That's this edge here. '39 was leading up to this here. Yeah. - 30,000 ounces. Right here. Looks like they actually pre-struck the ground, so they were intending to go back in there, at some point. They left a lot of good ground up there basically. Some rich up there. When the Fairbanks Exploration Company shut down dredge number 3 in 1957, over 2 million ounces of gold had been produced, worth almost $4 billion today. But it appears that in 1940, for some reason, the dredge stopped, turn a corner, and left 22 acres of stripped land unmined. If the pay streak continues on this virgin ground, it could be 15 times richer than Parker's Indian River claims. There's a lot of things this map and Drew tell us. Cut 7 was pretty good, but marginal. Cut 8, 9, and 10, which was right on the end before they turned, went very good. There was a lot of gold in it. So that's encouraging for what we're looking at mining over here. But it still doesn't help us much with explaining why the dredge turned around. - You know, World War II happening simultaneous to-- - 1940. Well, they lost a lot of workers... Yeah. ...to the war efforts as well and, uh, I mean, there's a lot of different factors - that are more than just the gold playing a part. Mmm-hmm. All right, this is sweet. Thanks, Drew. - Not a problem. - But we're gonna go see if we can, I guess go make sense of this, huh? The Cleary Creek claim is 20 miles outside of Fairbanks. So, I think from about here, we have about half a million square feet of virgin ground. I think I can get along that stripping pile, put a line in now, that's where we'll start. Starting where the dredge turned, drill a series of test holes across the stripped ground and to the downstream end of the claim, to find out if the old timers left a massive pay day behind. But first, Liam needs to build a road into the drill zone. The leaves will be falling next, then we'll be getting snow, so we'd better quarry up and find some gold, so we can come mining here next year. Operator Kyle Jacobs brings in the $1 million Sonic drill on Liam's new road. Overloaded the pump and it stalled the machine out. Damn it. Yeah, it's stuck on it right now. Shifting the weight of the 1,400-pound drill head forward should improve traction. Try to get a run at it, I guess keeping momentum up may help. Oh, here she goes. Moors are bogging down. That's more like it. We made her, bud. Barely, but we made her. It's time to find out if Cleary Creek still has gold rich virgin ground. See if we can find any gold. Over halfway through the mining season, Tony Beets, the king of the Klondike, is battling to make a comeback after a disastrous miscalculation left him unable to mine on Indian River. So far, with one wash plant running on Paradise Hill, he's mined just over 2,000 ounces of gold. Now he's pinning his hopes on gold rich white channel pay dirt from the 25-acre wall cut. Tony, Tony, do we got a copy? Yup, feeder keeps shutting down. It's going, stopping, going, stopping, going, stopping. It's leaving long stretches on the bell end. DFA. You want me to shut it down? Yeah, okay. I'll get down there and shut it down right away. Okay, let's go have a look. Tony calls in eldest son and mechanic, Kevin, to investigate. If it's gonna be anywhere, it's gonna be over here. Oh, yeah, that's it, right there. Sprocket is no longer a sprocket, it is now an idler. Meaning the teeth that grab the rail, ain't there no more, she's smooth. No wonder she's skipping. Now that means she's pretty Bare minimum, we have to replace that sprocket. The feeder loads gold rich pay onto the conveyer, leading to the trommel, but after 25 years, the teeth on the driver's sprockets have worn smooth and the belt is slipping. The feeder's slipping like a I think those sprockets are right done. I don't know how they look to you, they look to me. Probably don't have any other choice. We're not gonna weld that back together. It's been in there for years, it's time to put in a new one. So, I'm gonna rip out, put a new one together, slam it back in, off we go. Removing the feeder is a labor intensive task. First step, cut it free from the hopper. Hopefully, we can get it done quick, get it back up and running and get back to the gold. Yeah, I got another tab here, too, that's welded. Is there another weld over there? Now, to drag the hopper out. Nothing but problems and headaches. Tony's a smart man. He can be a little tough sometimes. But you just make it work and do whatever he asks. This is gonna be a long day. We're all gonna take a step back in case falls. I don't like the look of this. Better not drop it! Well, that was close. The Beets' only wash plant is down with a broken feeder. Every hour they're not sluicing, Tony's losing $2,700. There's always pressure to get done. The season's short as is, but especially with the trommel 'cause when it ain't spinning, we ain't making no gold. With the hopper out, they now need to detach the 30-foot long conveyer before they can even get to the feeder. Yup. beautiful. Mike loads the conveyer onto the 500-horsepower Oshkosh military tank transporter. Not too bad. While Mike uses an excavator to push the feeder free... ...Kevin tag teams it using the pipe layer to pull. This thing is We don't have any other parts on site. After spending nine hours removing the feeder, Tony now has to wait three days for the replacement sprocket to arrive. This, I guess is what you call putting all your eggs in one basket. Two-thirds of the way through the season, Rick Ness is taking the biggest gamble of his mining career. We're trying to get 2,000 ounces this year. And, uh, I think it's gonna pay off huge. Um, and if it doesn't, we are gonna go down in a blaze of glory unlike anybody's ever seen. He stopped sluicing to concentrate his resources on opening a monster cut. The 190-foot deep Rally Valley. If Rick's not running pay dirt in three weeks, he won't have time to get all the gold before winter hits. It's a bit of a gamble. I hope this works out. I did the math on it. I've got three trucks running. I need at least 600 truckloads a day. There's just no way to get those kind of numbers with one shift. Our best shot at it is... Is adding a night crew. Morning, pal. Good morning, Richard. I'm trying to be an, uh... A scientist and do math. And what are you thinking? We're looking at over a million yards of overburden here and, at the moment, I think we've only moved about 300,000. So [bleep], at that rate we're not gonna be sluicing this year. -[bleep], that's a lot of dirt. Yeah. Well, what, uh... What're you thinking? Well, we're gonna have to do a night shift. If we wanna sluice this year, that's the only way. So I... I kind of need you to step up and be the night foreman. Well, I'm excited, man, I'd definitely do that for you. If we can get it stripped in three weeks, that could be the difference between us going home with profit, you with gold in your pocket, or not. I'll do my best I can for you and, uh, - hopefully, we can conquer this at a fast pace. - All right. - Buddy, thanks. - Get some sleep, I'll see you tonight. - All right? - Sounds good, man. I'm really gonna be putting the pressure on Brennan. You know, although he does have several years of experience now, um, we're not gonna let him think that that gets him a free pass. I really need him to, uh... To work out. I wanna shoot high. I mean, I've taken on the role of nightshift foreman and it's a step in the right direction of trying to move up the ladder. To justify Rick's trust, Brennan needs to hit 300 loads by the end of the night. Coming from working at Parker's, we always find a lot of gold and I know what it takes to get there. But Parker and I, we're not getting along so much the last few years, so I was walking on eggshells 90% of the time. Last season, Brennan came under pressure as co-foreman at Parker's claim. Like, I shouldn't have to walk the floor and find, like, yards of rock. I have hardly dug any of this. I don't care. You're in charge or you're not in charge. After jumping ship, Brennan's determined to prove he can handle the pressure. Rick and I are on the same page, so I've been trying to watch my ass and... And show to him that I care about what's going on. I want us all to have a successful season and be ready to come back next year with a smile on our face. What the hell is going on in here? Hey, Brennan, I think my truck just messed up. Something going on here, I gotta check it out. Are you being serious right now? Okay, buddy. Well, I'll be up here to help you. I can't afford this truck to go down right now. Unbelievable. sakes, man. damn it. Yeah, this kind of sucks 'cause we don't have the time for this to be down right now. Three rock trucks, one down. I don't know what we're gonna do now. The 34-ton truck is not only out of commission, it's also blocking the path to the waste site. Been down for the last 45 minutes. Every load we miss is a load that's hard to get back. With time ticking, Brennan needs the stranded truck moved. The rear axle's bushing that holds it to the front here fell apart. No power can get to the back wheels because the drive shaft isn't attached to the axle. You wanna grab that, buddy? So Brennan orders his crew to remove it. Okay, Nick, you think if we just put that box down, - you'll be able to limp it up there? - Yep. Okay, buddy. We'll get this thing rolling and get theback to work. With only a few hours left, Brennan pushes his two remaining trucks to try and hit Rick's 300 load target. How'd she go, buddy? Well, not as good as we wanted. We, uh, didn't get our 300 loads in. Riley's truck went down last night there, so-- Are you serious? - This is not a good start. - No. I don't know what's up with these trucks, I know they got a lot of hours on them but... It's just like every time we're in the crunch, we have to deal with a breakdown. Yeah, no, I understand that. I'm not trying to give you Hopefully, it's a quick fix and... You know, we get back all the trucks running and I'm gonna get to it because I definitely gotta get 300 this shift. Okay, sounds good, buddy. - Thanks, pal. Yeah. - See you tonight. Yeah, I mean, we need to be hitting that 300 loads per shift, Like, it has to happen. If we're gonna get down to pay in three weeks, that's the only way to do it. Hopefully in the future our luck changes with these breakdowns. Parker Schnabel is racing to find new ground in Alaska to secure the future of his mining business. The ground here is a lot deeper than in the Yukon. And, you know, where we think that 40 or 50 feet is really deep, you know, in Alaska that's the shallowest ground around. In a lot of the ground that we'll be looking at, it's 100 plus. Definitely puts the pressure on, um... On doing good exploration and just making sure you know what's in the ground before you lose a bunch of money. For the past three days, drill operator, Kyle Jacobs, has sunk a series of 100 foot deep holes searching for gold rich virgin ground at Dredge Corner. For the ground to pay off, he needs at least 150 milligrams of gold in each hole. And so far, he's found just 30. It's nice to be out in the woods. We're struggling to get on the gold. Alaska is gonna be a challenge for us. - Hey, Kyle! At 60 feet, the drill hits bedrock far sooner than expected. Old-timers definitely could have seen that bedrock. And that's why they skipped around Dredge Corner, 'cause they hadn't hit pay. This shallower ground could explain why the dredge turned. Parker and Liam take the drill sample back to the gold room to assess it further. All right, so this is the bottom of the hole that we drilled. There's no pay layer in that sample. There's nothing in there. We're going broke. I don't think this is bedrock. It's too shallow. What do you think we should do? I think it's worth going back, drill some holes, confirm what we're seeing here. All right, that seems like a good call. Liam suspects that the hard layer they've hit could be a layer of rock with pay gravel, with the real bedrock hidden underneath. Where's all the gold at, Doze? Where's all the gold at? If Liam's wrong, Parker stands to lose thousands more dollars drilling worthless ground. We're finding 10 to 15 feet of gravel below this rock. Usually don't have gravel below bedrock, so it's kind of weird to, uh, drill. What's up, dude? Just hanging out with the Doze man. Is he finding any gold? No, he's not a very good gold-seeking dog. Well, we've been finding some pretty interesting stuff here, too. - Oh, yeah? Yeah, it's, um... At first, we thought we were drilling... We drilled through a big boulder that was just floating. And then, we started seeing it again on another hole. Then, we realized it wasn't actually just a rock, it was actually a full... Bed of bedrock with gravel below it. How would that happen? Um, it's probably slide rock coming down off the hill. Thousands of years ago, a seam of rock slid off the hillside, covering what could be a layer of gold-rich pay. Over the years, dirt was deposited above it. When the old-timers stripped this ground, they may have believed that the slide rock was bedrock and abandoned it. I mean, it's a good thing that these guys know what they're doing because, like, hitting that slide rock, a lot of people would be like, "Oh, we're on bedrock." But it looks like there's some gravel underneath it. There's... There's more gravel than we previously thought, so that's good. Gravel doesn't make any money though. It needs to be gravel with gold in it. I'm not just putting the mining season on the line for this. This is literally the mining career. If this doesn't work out, my guys, you know, are gonna lose their bonus and, uh, I'm gonna be done mining. That's how... That's how serious this is. At Rally Valley, Rick Ness is less than halfway to hitting gold-rich pay dirt 120 feet down. He needs to start sluicing within three weeks. I split everybody in half. I've got, uh, four people running at night, four people during the day. We're just going straight down in this cut. You know, we'll be spending three weeks, uh, without gold coming in and doing nothing but burning fuel, spending money, moving dirt. And, uh, it's all for the hope of a big pay day down here. After a rock truck broke down on Brennan's night shift, Rick's running with only two-thirds of his fleet. I haven't had a full-time mechanic all year which is insane to me. But we've kept things rolling. If I've got machines go down, and we're down for days or... Or weeks or whatever, or even a day, like, I can't afford it. So I did manage to get Torsten back here. Twenty-year-old apprentice mechanic, Torsten Petersson, needs to replace the broken bushing, and refit the rock truck's axle and drive shaft. They already lost like a good 50 loads so we gotta get this truck up and going for them as quick as possible. Without the bushing in there, and doing its job, this thing's just like a giant paper weight sitting in the middle of nowhere doing nothing. It's great to have Torsten back. Hopefully, we can get this truck back up and running today, and, uh, we'll be back on track. Back a bit. Other way. This? Other way. Keep going, keep... Stop. After four hours, Torsten and operator, Nathan Thornington... - You done yet? Almost. ...are ready to see if the fix has worked. Really? Then how come you're still under there? Yeah, 'cause you're distracting me. I am not. You should have thought, like, mechanics were multitaskers. Shut up! Torsten just got that truck back up and running so we're back at three trucks. We're... We're not gonna hit our 300 loads today. You know, that's just, uh... It's just not gonna happen. We're gonna be at about 280, uh, which is just isn't acceptable. Unfortunately for Brennan, he's... He's picking up the slack tonight. And, uh, really hope that he's up to it. This is the deepest cut I've ever done in my life, and I wanna prove to Rick and myself that I can do this. I'm hungry, man, I'm awolf. I wannamove up the ladder. Night shift foreman, Brennan Ruault, is racing to move 300 loads of overburden and make up the 20 loads short fall from the day shift. I think night shift's, uh, doing a big help for making up lost time. We have a lot less distractions. We just get here. We load, we load, we load, we load. And, uh, you know, if we don't have any breakdowns, you know, it's achievable. What the [bleep]? No way! Not the again here. Can't even peel through this ground. You know, everything seems to go good until it doesn't. And now I hit this hard ground again. damn it. Hey, Riley? You got a copy, bud? Riley. We got a copy, Brennan. Just hit some hard ground again here and it's just... I can't even dig it with these tiger teeth. We've hit some glacial till. You know, it's like... It's like a mud but very hard packed with gravel. brutal, it might as well be frozen. But it's not. And it just... Is very, very abrasive. The only machine that can rip the glacial till is the 475 Dozer. Okay, well, I gotta get cracking here and get ripping in the Dozer. Let's switch Riley out. But the 900 horsepower beast costs $5000 in fuel a day. With no money coming in, it's a big call. What you need to be able to do is think quick on your feet, especially at night time, you know. We cannot afford to lose any loads at all, or time, if we wanna get down 150 feet just to get to pay. The one deadly weapon we have this year is this 475. I mean, [bleep], this thing push mountains and rip mountains. This thing's worth its weight in gold for what we gotta do. With the glacial till being torn out by the Dozer, they can get back to loading overburden with the 700. - Hey, Ricky! - How did you go, buddy. - Good, buddy. 323 loads. - You did? yeah. - You're my man. There's that weird hard layer which is a to get through. Yeah, I don't get it. I thought this was all gonna be soft and fluffy and we'll be motoring through. - Did you have to rip it all or-- - Yeah, I did a little bit threw Riley in the hole quick, kept them going and, uh, I got that... but everybody was on their game last night. You had to get out of the excavator, still hit over 320. Dude, that's... awesome. Yeah, buddy. I can't wait to see what's at the bottom of this. - Me too, dude. - That's a lot of dirt. Yeah, all right. Having Brennan on the team this year just keeps paying off. Man, I love it. You know, when he stepped up to be a night foreman, I knew he's knock it out of the park. You know, last night he made up for the loads that we missed during the day shift. And that's what I'm gonna need him to do for the rest of the year, so... We still gotta lot of dirt to get down to the pace. But we'll get there. After a three day wait, the new sprocket for the paradise hill trommel has arrived. So far, the shutdown has cost Tony almost $200,000 in lost gold. We're not sluicing, we aren't making money. And if you ain't making money, that means all you doing is spending it. With the replacement part lowered into position, they must fit the feeder track onto the new sprocket. What does it look like, Cody? - Move at all? It moved a bit. Tony, copy Tony. You wanna come take a look at this? We got it holed tight, but it still won't line up at the sprocket. The steel rail needs to locate precisely on the sprocket teeth. We measured between top to top and it was an eighth of an inch difference in the front. This ain't good. Sprockets on the new gear, they don't match the rail. Meaning... that when you turn it, instead of fitting in these pockets here, they sit on the sprocket teeth. That's not good, we have the exact same problem in a week. The old drive sprocket on the feet are wore smooth 'causing the track to skip. But at the other end, the idler sprockets with no load on them are still intact. Tony's bush fix swap the idlers with the drive sprockets. This is supposed to be quick. - Come on, there we go. After 7 hours, the sprockets are swapped out. Hopefully, we can get back to sluicing soon. It's a temporary fix that Tony can only hope will last till the end of this season. - Yeah. - Damn right. Much better. Mike takes the weight of the feeder on the pipe layer as Kevin in the excavator pulls it back into position. If everything goes smooth, we may be able to sluice tonight. The 30 foot conveyor is then bolted back on to the new feeder. I always feel like any downtime is too much down time. 'Cause we gottaproduce the season sure enough as it is. So, it will be very nice to see this running again. If the bush fixes work, it will save weeks of downtime waiting for replacement parts. Yeah. All right, you ready? Put some dirt on there, let's get going. All right, finally up and running. Everything should work, I mean... we fixed all the mechanical stuff and... work out. Let's see if this spins. Beautiful. We have life and movement. This, uh, stockpile we got here, I'd bet you they could see it from space if they look real close. And our side pieces seem to be working, lovely. Good to see it moving' again. Means we're making money again, instead of just spending it. To stand any chance of hitting his 4500 ounce season goal, Tony must mine around the clock. Okay, don't lick. What do you think Pugsy, you like being in here? I mean, this job gets pretty monotonous, so it could be pretty lonely after a while, you know, so it is nice having him here, makes me laugh. - Good boy! That's a good boy. Coming up? Come on. Good man! Good man, good man. Who's that? Who's that? Get 'em. - Good man, get 'em! - Your dog is so grumpy. He's got so much hate in such a tiny body. - I'm just training him who to growl at. That's a guard dog. You ready for quitting time? You gonna go for a big run afterwards? You're gonna chase me side by side? Good man. - Brendon, can I talk to you for a bit? - All right. I hope you're not fired. - You're fired. Rick is over half way to pay at Rally Valley, and has some news for Brendon. So no, you're not fired. - Okay, good. You and I both know the severity of what we're up against in Rally Valley. - Yeah, it's pretty big. - Like, it's big. - Yeah, - Yeah, and, uh, we're gonna have to have eyes and ears in there at all times - because one mistake, we're not gonna make it. - Mmm-hmm. - No. - Coming in here, I said I wasn't really looking - for a foreman. - Mmm-hmm. Um, but, you know, you have proved yourself and things have changed a bit. So, that's why I'm kinda hoping that, you know, I can ask you to step up. Be the foreman, you know, when I'm not around and take that responsibility on. sure, man, I'd love to do that. - Yeah. -[bleep], yeah. That's awesome. It's a no brainer for me. I mean, it's been great having you here this year. You know, I've been able to rely on you and, um, you know, I think this is a perfect time. Appreciate that, man. I don't know what to say. I'm definitely excited and I'll do my best for you. So... - Thank you. - Yeah. I got a lot of work ahead of me. Yeah, you do. We all do. You sure you don't want a minute to think about it? No. I hope I'm ready for it. You're ready. Yeah. When I came here I didn't know what to expect. And so far it's been the best move I've ever made. Super happy and now Rick's asked me to step up and be the foreman in Rally Valley and you know, I honestly couldn't be happier. But I got a lot of work ahead of me. So I'm gonna get my ass to bed. Get up and get ready to conquer the day tomorrow. Hi. - How are you all? - Um, surviving. - I exist. How did it go this week? Uh, it was a Well, that's nice. What did you do? Where did you break? Uh, the feeder finally went. - Wow. - I noticed that it was... So it was slipping'. - Oh, yeah. I crawled underneath... for safety. There was nothing. - Cool. - It's amazing we're still turning. With the feeder down and all that, like so far we've had quite the downtime. Cool, so my child is expiring and I want to see how much gold you got. Let's play. - Expiring? Yeah. Yeah. Well, of course, they have a due date. All babies have a due date. But they have the best buy time. Don't know. I did it last time. I'm off the hook. I did it last time! - No, no, I did it the last time. Michael! Michael, you haven't done it for a while. Tony's only sluiced wall cut white channel pay... for two days this week. He needs 237 ounces to hit his goal. Ten, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, seventy, 80, ninety, 100. Keep going. No dies. I know. 105.24 Worth almost $190,000, but less than half of their weekly target. Hundred ounces isn't great, but we're making our way towards our total, or are we still a long ways off? Not a long ways off. We're still quite a ways off. I guess long ways still. Hey, every little ounce counts. With that being said, I think everybody should leave and go to work. What about you? Yeah! Because this is my house, I can work from home. - Can I work from home? Nope. - Can I work from home? I can work from home. Nope, nope. My new VR thing I can till the mechanical hands, I can do work from home! I only need the Internet and a computer, that's all I need. I take all of it. In Cleary Creek, Alaska... Make an a la carte... It is difficult. Whoa, you're like a pro, man! Parker and drilling contractor, Liam Ferguson, have drilled 30 test holes at Dredge Corner. All right, Parker, this is one of those holes that I was talking about that had a stump for a while, but turns out there's a layer of false bedrock that's coming off the hill and bearing the gravel. So we're kinda hoping that maybe the old-timers just hit that first layer and stopped. I'm surprised that you guys found that, really. It took a few holes. Like it's pretty easy to just hit bedrock and... Yeah, so, we um-- Like, "Oh, bedrock, cool. Move on." Is there any gold in any of this? Parker needs at least 150 milligrams of gold per hole to make the ground viable. We hit in one hole, 26... Right. ...thirty, and then it just pretty consistently seemed to hit 135, hit virgin, 187... One eighty seven. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, look at that! Cool! That one's not bad. Yeah, it's about 200 overall. At 200 milligrams per hole, Dredge Corner is potentially ten times richer than Parker's claims at Indian River. Think of that nug. Dude, you hit nug! That's better than all the other projects that you've done with me. There's more gold in this ground. It makes it easy. With a payday that could be worth over $11.5 million, Parker has found Alaskan ground. It's looking promising. Go home and pack your bags. - Thanks, dude. See you, Parker. Yeah, it's good to see some gold coming out of the drilling, you know? Liam and I have drilled a lot of ground that has no gold in it, or not enough to go mining. And it's nice to finally be like... ...honor some stuff that's really productive. Like, 6,000 ounces drilled out so far, and there's some healthy profit in there. Of course, I always want more. As I should get back to the Yukon, make sure we're making enough money to pay for all this.
