Charlotte is off to a violent start in 2019 with more homicides in the first month of a year than we've seen in decades. Homicide's not taking a break this holiday weekend. It's unfortunate. In three days, three people killed in three separate crimes in Charlotte. First, a person shot to death in a luxury apartment complex in the heart of uptown. Then a body discovered in a grocery store parking lot in University City, and now, a man shot and killed in a motel room. Right after the teen was killed, shots rang out at the crime scene, Sending police, passersby, even our own news crew ducking for cover. Four people killed in four shootings this weekend alone. Out with new crime stats. Overall violent crime is up 11%. You can see homicide's up the most, a whopping 230%. Police say most of the incidents involve teens, oftentime repeat offenders who are responsible. Officers say many times victims are not always willing to help put the crooks behind bars before it's too late. A call coming in at 5:43 am for a shooting on Ohaus Court in north Charlotte. I heard six rounds go off. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Police say the gunfire came from outside the house.
