??Insecticide playing Controlling every day with the palm of their hands Settling every day with radio wave Do humans are really connected? Looks like we got choices But ended up same like everyone Could you love yourself like that? Things we do really wanted to feel The warmth, beat, sweat and tears Supposed to be that simple Right now Right now Use your senses to the fullest Chase the world with that tiny body I'm on your side! I'm on your side! Never give up to fight Go beyond yourself with that big heart "Wait us at the rooftop" - Sakaguchi Shun "Rooftop, nothing here" - Me "Look up" - Sakaguchi Shun Gimme a break! Oh, hurry up please. Right now Right now Wake up all your senses Open the future door with your 5 senses Become the new of you We came to pick you up, Aki. Don't come with helicopter! So you prefer limousine, then? Normal cab is enough. It's a celebrate, this way's better. Be honest. You do love heli! The one that I like is radio-controlled heli. "The one that I like is radio-controlled heli" he says. I'm leaving. Wait, wait, wait! Don't be mad! You're so childish. So, I'm leaving now. Shinya! You see, that heli is for 4 person. I'll leave the rest to you, all childhood friends to enjoy yourself. I'll head to party lounge first. Shun!! We've considered it through and did it on purpose. Shinya, it must be hard for him being 'Shinya'. Well, get on! Let's celebrate together! Album Vol. 3! During that time, I was moody all the time. But why do I am moody... I don't even know the right reason myself. "The Liar and His Lover" Seriously? But, even I'm like this... Gosh! Mr. Takagi's here. Everyone can't wait to celebrate you all, you know. And about you too, Aki. Thanks. I had fun. Wait! You're not coming? Uh. "World peace"... ...have you managed to write it? Our genius boy, what'll he become? You see he.. originally, he didn't want to do it like this. Music... has no meaning if you can't sell it. Whenever and wherever... ...the world can easily get music... ...I don't think it's bad. But that easiness... ...is making music as something to be wasted. I felt that way. But there's a definite way of making profit from music that belongs to that kind of world, the songs that I wrote for high school buddies, ...ranked into charts before I knew it, ...and when I realized, we already got everything. But... "World peace (demo)" But... ...I wonder why? I feel emptier than those days, ...when I got nothing. Maybe because I don't have a thing, ... of those things that I really wanted. Is it done? My song? Speak to me if you came. I did speak, so many times. Didn't I tell you? I won't be doing Takagi's ghost anymore. Aki, you're my boyfriend right? Mari... Mari, I'm begging you. I can't do this any longer. What is it? Picturing you sleeping with that guy alone would've made me crazy. I knew it. There's no way I won't notice. Leave the key. What a shame! (Hum) ...in no time I fell in love... (Hum) ...with you... (Hum) ...surely you made fun of me... (Hum) ...why...we met... Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! I'm sorry! Yes. At that time I was moody at the whole time, ...I'm suffering, ... I just need to steady myself. So that honestly, ... I talked to her just because she happened. 'Love at first sight',... ... do you believe in it? Eh? Urm... Oh no, I'm just kidding you! More like... it's better for you to Oh... Urm... You better not speak to stranger who suddenly burst out weird things. Well, then. I believe. Wha..? Because, ... I have fall in love at first sight just now. Whattt? It's not love at first sight, ...but your hum just now. Hum? It sent me goosebumps. Please tell me your name. I am Koeda Riko. I'm Shinya. Ogasawara Shinya. Ogasawara ... Shinya. At that early stage of dating you, I don't have the slightest feelings of liking you. They're all... ...lies. But to the big fat liar me, ...she says I'm an honest person. So unlike the rest, Mr. Shinya is the only one who is not the childhood friends, ...you are invited to the Crude Play later? Originally it's Aki the bassist, but he cranked up right before the debut. So I just fill in the hole. But, may I know why...? Well, ...part of the reasons is actually me. Stop it, Shinya! I'm kidding, Kaoru! What? You're fooling around a girl? Sort of. I'm going to a date, now. Whoa. So, what kind of girl? Urm... ...like a mushroom, ...like a mushroom. What the hell is that? Her hairstyle. She told me her name is... ...Koeda... something. Well, she's the daughter of fruit stall's owner in the neighborhood. Oh, that's pretty close to you. Shun! Well, try not to mess things up ok? Don't worry. I'll try and try my best, ...to like her like I mean it. Bye! Pity that girl! Spare me! As a mahaguru, I need to teach my dogs. I've decided to separate my works and my private life?! There's no way you can do that. In the middle of your value, ...there's a thing called music. I want a relationship that has no relation to music. That new girl, ...she's only looking at you as Aki of Crude Play. I never told her that I'm Aki and I will never tell her. Until when you can stay like that? What a wimp! Opps! Mr. Takagi if you planned to go home like that, you better stop. Oh yeah? On that clothes of yours,... ...I can smell Mari's Chloe perfume. Gosh! I forgot how she looks like. All Crude Play songs are composed by Aki isn't it? Why is he never showed up? He's ex-member right? Hmm, because he's an ugly one? Rumor on internet said he's a fat guy. Is that so? That's why they replaced him with Shinya! There you are! Is there something wrong? Nothing. I don't know why but your voice... Urm, Should we go to somewhere else? A quieter place, maybe. - Oh my gosh! I'm their huge fan! You don't know them? Ah, because I don't listen to music that much. They're the best! Please listen to them. The songs that made by this Aki, are really the best. And Shinya's bass too. So this is your boyfriend? Yuu? And Sou too? I'm sorry Riko. I can't stop him. They're my friends. What the hell Riko? Your boyfriend is an uncle? Uncle? What is he doing? What was it? If you really need to know, ...I'm a neet. (Not in Education, Employment or Training) A neet??? You're not working. Is it okay for a grown up to be like this? That's unforgivable isn't it? Ouch that hurts! Let's run away! What? Wait!! Hey! What about your friends? This is a training for true ability. I can't get it out of my head since then... Your hum at that time, ...I asked everyone but no one knows. Urm, ...what are you talking about? It's sad, and intense, not to be sung with soft voice... ...but it makes you want to sing it out loud. I can't breathe! I'm sorry!! Mr. Ogasawara? I'm... ...scared of songs. What? Maybe... ...I hate songs. Why? Why are you crying? What are you talking about? I'm not crying. But you will, don't you? What?? What's this? Hold on a sec. Damn it! Don't look! It's okay. I'll protect you. You don't sing, right? Eh? Don't sing. I hate women who sing. As I thought, it won't last for two weeks. I've said so, haven't I Nakahama? If a beauty sings about heartbroken songs, ...they'll just go into shadows. I am sorry. You see, most of love songs... ...are sung by random singers, that's how they're valued. Well I won't say they're ugly, ...but beauties definitely won't do it. I think it's time for Mari to sing about world peace. But Aki won't write a song about it. There's something wrong with Mr. Aki lately. He's kind of irritated. A genius like him, ...will write better songs when distressed. Let him be more distressed, that's better. Where are you going? Aki's place. You left it open again! Sorry. Anything wrong? Hey Sou... Hmm? 'I hate singing women'... what do you think this means? Your boyfriend said that? Must be that neet. Guess I can never say it. The fact I actually love singing... We're ready, Riko. Geez! There's nothing left if you take away the song?! This' the perfect time to sing and get yourself back. Right. I get it. You're right! Ahhhhhhh I feel like screaming!!! About me and Mr. Takagi... All this time, I'm afraid that you'll find out. It's not like I was pressured into the relationship. It's just, ...when I first met him, ...I was an ordinary high school girl and he said this to me, "What should I do? ... ... I've found a genius." He's the one who found me. It was him. Thanks Mari. You made me clear about my own feelings. You know, I... ...have found a girl. She, ...doesn't know that I'm the Aki of Crude Play, ...and thinks that I'm no one but just a neet. Even so, she... ...said this to me : "I will protect you". Even though I don't write songs for her. She still said that. I think I want to treasure a girlfriend like her. What a perfect balance of three! Who? What should I do? I... ...have found the genius?! You're selected to debut. Congratulations! What? Urm, we don't quite understand... In other words, ...you'd be releasing CDs, doing live concerts, .... ...appear on tv and all that stuffs. That's amazing!!! Seriously? Eh? For real? You see, we just started playing instruments... It has nothing to do with your perfomance skill to debut. If you can pretend in front of the camera, ...leave it to the pro to play it for you. Don't show me that face. It's normal. Even Crude Play did the same. The one who play by his own... ...is Shinya only. You surprised me! I'm the one who's surprised here. You guys getting better huh? Heard that you practiced everyday? Yeah. We wanted to record the new song with us playing. Yeah right! That's no joke. Place yourself as the audience who paid to hear low amateurs playing. Pity, isn't it? Super amazing musicians will play for you. You don't have to worry. Guess you're right? By the way, ...have you seen Aki? Seems like he's heading here. I see. Oh yeah. It's not a bad thing to practice. You'll get better at pretending to be playing. Teppei! Come back here! You heard that? It's too much... I know! I know. But then, ...don't you get it wrong. It's not that he is wrong. It's us who play like garbage. We are the one to blame. Hey! You came at the perfect time. There are kids I wanted you to meet. I'm no good at meeting people. Won't you try become a producer? Pardon? Crude Play's Aki first produce, ...brilliant high school girl as the lead singer, ...band members all childhood friends. What are you up to this time? If only the pretty faces, ...they'll be same level as idols. But I've found the kids, ...who don't have those aura. To be on the side of taking advantage like you? I won't, never. Well, just meet them? If that's the story... Can I be a part of it? Crude Play's Shinya, first produce. Oh I think it's catchy this way. What do you think? Aki is really an idiot. There's nothing you can do about it. He said that he won't do it himself. He certainly will if he'd listened to this. Yeah, I bet he will. If he listened to this voice, ...bet he would treasure this girl. But, ... this girl is mine. I will treasure her. ??Sotsugyou playing Never changed, always the same classroom There is the most precious friends I could never replace 'Why our school bread is all dried out like this?' Those kind of things, soon we could no longer say to each other Let's go and change ourselves! Even we haven't find things we wanted to do yet Let's laugh out loud We're not going to end ourselves here Wait a sec! We did it, didn't we? - We did! How cool it this?! Be prepared for a life change! After debut, you four can no longer go to McDonald together. CD Cover : CRUDE PLAY "Sotsugyou" (Graduation) McDonald? I want to go... My life will definitely changed! Now! I have different thing to discuss with the songwriter. Follow me. If anyone did realize, ...I think it's only you. It's not us playing, isn't it? I gathered all no. 1 studio musicians to play for you. It didn't cost you a penny, ...be thankful! What up with that face! Don't tell me you guys planning to be pro performers? You have good ears, you should know. Your performance, ...and pro's performance. Which one has the value to be heard? How about the bass? Who's playing my bass? That kid. Shinohara Shinya. He's one year younger than you. Shinya! It's Aki from Crude Play. Mr. Takagi, I understand. But I have one request. What is it? Let him be in Crude Play to replace me. I... ...will stop playing. Hello. It's Riko. Koeda Riko. Yeah, I know. I uh, ...there's something I need to tell you Mr. Ogasawara. Hey, ...you said you'll protect me right? What? Urm, yes. Really? Really. From what? Everything. Everything that will hurt you. Pardon? The person in the music textbook also mentioned the same. Music.... ...is he famous? Yeah, his name uh, ...Matsu... Matsu... Matsu or something like that. What? I said something funny? Let's meet up. Where are you now? It can't be! Hey! ...you did that on purpose? No I don't! Wha..? I'll take care of you. Koeda Riko, I will take a good care of you. I can't help it! You laughed way too much! Why did you say Ogasawara Shinya? Whole lot better if you said Ogasawara Shun. I can't wait to hear what's next. But well, ...wondered what happened after you broke up with Mari, never guessed you'll mess up this bad. She's really just a normal high school girl. So I wanted to be myself in front of her, ...and wanted to be liked as the way I am. So you want to keep lying and continue dating? I get it! So, I planned to tell her the truth. Excuse me. Excuse us. Let me through. Sorry. Thanks for today! Sou, what are we gonna do? We came as we're told. We're totally misplaced huh? Yeah that but, ...I still can't tell the truth to Mr. Ogasawara. What? Thanks for today! Oh my! So beautiful! Smells so good! Sou, she smells so good just now! You like Mari? Yes! Love her! Perfect idol for girls! Mari's 'YOU'... ...was actually written by Aki. Not Mr. Takagi? Well, there's a lot of things in music world. You'll get it soon. This way. Crude Play's new song for today... ... is also written by Aki. You guys are the first audience to listen to this. Great! What kind of guy is Aki? In overall, ... he's a fool. Fool? Because obviously he's a genius, ...but he believed himself as a nobody. A laughable joke... ...sometimes I tend to think he's a real idiot. I, ....love all songs written by Aki very much. Me too. Yeah, I love it. As much as sometimes I feel like hating it. What the? Neet! What are you doing? You are... But why are you here? Tour visit? You know what, ...we've been spotted for new talents. Spotted. Spotted? By who? You serious? This is not a joke! It happened by chance. Well, maybe not. Originally it's you who led me to her voice. Voice? You, ...dating her while knew nothing about her? What are you intend to do with her? Work. Business. Music is words and strength-added way for making money. Is it not? You made me feel sick. What the hell are you talking about. Crude Play did the same way to get sold isn't it? I won't let you play such games on Riko. But, ...is it okay for you to fool around here? Shinya said he'll make her as his treasure. Camera roll in 10 sec, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 sec, 4, 3... This is their first time performing this song. Crude Play new song, "Sayonara no junbi wa mou dekite ita." Please welcome Crude Play.

I'm all prepared to say goodbye That song...? Whenever, even now, since long way ago The ending has now begun Goodbye to our Glory Days Why? Why..? Sorry. I lied. My name is not Shinya... It's Aki. Wha..? Ogasawara Aki. You mean that Aki? Yeah. Crude Play's Aki. I'm lying about neet too. And about hating singing women. Urm, I sing actually. I know. Maybe the real is, I knew it since I first heard your voice at the bridge. Is that so? But, I keep on lying... ...and said "don't sing". I'm sorry. But... I don't think you're a liar, Mr. Ogasawara. Eh? Because, I can tell by listening to your music. When I first heard your hum, it sounds like a scream to me, and it's properly reached me inside here. And that's made me think that, ... I need to protect you. So that's why... ...to me, you're more honest than any other person. What's wrong? Oh no! I need you to know, ...the real me. You are Aki, ...for real. That's, ...the first instrument I got when I was 12. Why bass? I wanted a guitar actually. On my birthday, my dad... ...used his savings said he bought most expensive guitar, ..with that brag face. I was so happy, I went to show it to Shun.. ..and found out it's a bass. But at that time Shun said this : So we could form a band then. Adding Kaoru and Teppei, make it 4 of us practicing together, We've had really great time back then. I'd like to hear your bass too. Bass is something played with band so I guess, later. I love this song! That part is funny. The part of "School canteen bread tastes bad". Riko singing 'Sotsugyou' Aki's playing 'Sotsugyou' Never changed, always the same classroom There's most precious friends I could never replace 'Why our school bread... ...is all dried out like this?'

If they listen to the songs, I bet Mr. Takagi and Shinya will reconsider. How about Crude Play songs? Of course. I will continue writing. Can you manage it? During the debut, ...I've thought about it. Leaving Crude Play is the only conscience I could pay for music. But, ...eventually, I just running away. This time I won't. What the! Do as you please! But lemme say this. Don't cut-corners on our songs. Of course! Yeayy! Please let me do it. I will write Riko songs. No you can't. You won't make it to debut schedule. Plus, Shinya's demo is already done. Never thought she's your girlfriend. I'm sorry for debuting as Crude Play. Perhaps you were with your worries, ...but I felt miserable all the way. All this time, I wanted my own band. When I met Mush, I feel like, finally I've found my own place. Mush? I've decided to call her that way. She sounds so unique, ...Mush.

I uh, ...once turned my back to music, ...and I have suffered since then. But with you, I feel like I could face it again. You know, ...I feel so great about music. Why? It's because of you. You know, you're holding that for quite long. Oh no. Didn't even realized that. I usually drink this, so... ... somehow I feel weird. This tastes like lemon right? Lemon? Does it taste like that? It does. See, indeed it does... Hm, ... maybe it does. It does. Following this, ...Mush & Co. too will go with the uniforms and school image ... for our latest publish.

The thing that once I've got rid of it, though. How about Mari? I've talked to her already. She agreed. With one condition. Condition? She wants you to break up with Riko. For a scandal hunt, this is a smart topic creator. No doubt it was Takagi's idea. Don't listen to him! You have to refuse, definitely! But then ... ...Riko will... Hey, first of all, do you think Riko wanna go through all this to debut? Oi! Are you listening to me? Shun, ...I'll call you back. Aki! ??Riko singing Ashita mo?? It's a good song. Really good song.

And this is the first time we knew the real face of Aki. What a perfect couple eh. Handsome boy and pretty girl. After a year in a relationship, Aki will produce a song for Mari.... Sorry for calling you out of sudden. Bet you already knew. It's true, ...about that article. At that time, ...you said 'love at first sight'... Ah. I wonder if I really said that. That's, ...honestly it should've worked on anybody. No way! Because... because... You really don't get it. Let me make it clear. I don't like you even the slightest bit. Riko, you sing your own song. I wonder why, ... my throat dries at this time? The new song is completely different than you have done before. Do you feel it's due Aki's love? Yes. It's the best song that I want to treasure for my entire life. Right now, I'm filled with gratitude towards Aki. Mari's new single, produced by Aki? That's great! You see, he's really handsome. And talented. Bet he said, "Would you sing my song?" Awww that's cute!!! Hello! Koeda Fruits here! I will tell your father. Tsukishima ???????? Don't ever let you come for delivery again. Yeah, tell him that! Here. Your debut's live next week, ...I will definitely go! Thanks! Aki what?? Why? Anyway, ...he did send all these up. I supposed these went to you guys as well. These much? Do you have any idea what's on his mind? Are you going somewhere? Hey!! What the hell???? Riko! Damn it! Riko! What the hell am I doing? Aki! Hey! Shun! Riko did this to me. Heard you snatched his StingRay. Mr. Shun! Mr. Ogasawara is going somewhere. But, I can't say 'Please don't go' myself. At some place where nobody knows about him, ...he said he wanted to start all over again. Don't show me that face. He will definitely, ...become even greater when he comes back. It's gonna be fine. Lately he began to show good face. Like he used to in the old days. The happy face. It was after he met you. Well honestly, it's true, it's painful for him to see you in music, but, to admit that to you, don't you think it's too much for him? But, Mr. Ogasawara... ...about me... Actually I, ...snatched something from his house too. They're all still untitled, ...seemed freshly composed. He won't even let me listen to them and planned to bring this to London. Who do you think he wrote this for? If you listen to this, you'll know it all. Which are the truths, ... and which are the lies. Heard that he's leaving next week. Don't be late catching your flight. Till then, Aki. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Pepsi Nex presents the Mush and Co. debut live! Produced by Crude Play's Aki, Mush, Yuu and Sou, the trio will debut right now, right here!

She was dragged to the party. Ok. Where are you now? Shun!!!! Where you at, Shun?! This song....? Gosh, that Shun!! Sounds awful! No matter how, the sound will vibrate. That's because bass got thicker string than guitar. Wha?? Gosh! I've got too much to tell you, ...but I can't find the right words. Please tell me this one last thing. Mr. Ogasawara, the music that you create, ...is it the real you? No it's not. Shall we play together? You sing out of sudden We kiss out of sudden I really need to Say a lot of 'sorry' to you I'm afraid of losing you I'm the one who lie all the time But in front of you I want to be the real me Even if my existence Will be a shadow to your light I hope your existence Will continue shining on someone No matter i'm by your side or not You will shine here Towards me who always lie, ...she calls me an honest person. She smiled pretending to realize my lies, ...I've no right to like her, forever. Wait!! It continues at 1:54:56. Want to laugh together more Wanted to cry more, that'd make me feel better Only now I realized my true feeling I'm always thinking about you I will look for you everywhere Thought that I want to hear your voice Right now, here Your smiles Have brought me out of darkness into lights But my side face Will bring clouds to you No matter if you're here or not I can't be here The dreams you're holding in your palm Now go continue chasing after them I'm sure you could overcome it alone Even the reality now is holding you back and smothering you The dawn will definitely break eventually This song of mine I hope could push your back Because the thing I wanted to tell you I can't tell even one Your smiles Have brought me out of darkness into lights Someday if my smiles could syncronize with yours, it'd be nice The miracle of us met I'm thankful from the bottom of my heart Someday, will this song reach you? The tiny love song It's a love song It's a love song It's a love song... WAIT! DON'T HIT STOP YET! I'm going now. Riko! - THE END - Translations by Kay Rumi
