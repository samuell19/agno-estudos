SUBMARINE I-57 WILL NOT SURRENDER June 20, 1945 Right 60 degrees, large cruiser, distance 8000 Boat 4 - standby to launch! Ready! Ensign Endo, we pray for your success. Yes, thank you. Endo. Yamano, I'll lead the way. Release. Launch! Right 60 degrees, No. 4 boat. On my way. Understood. Understood. Hit. Captain. What? Message from Penang Base. Chief Petty Officer. Captain, something's up. Headquarters has ordered an end to our current mission. And make an expedited return to Penang Base on the Malay Peninsula. We've been given a new assignment. That is all. Captain. Heading 230 degrees. Heading 230 degrees. It’s odd. The Okinawa garrison has been annihilated. The next attack has to be the mainland. Why go to Penang? What good is it? I don’t know. But we've received a direct order from General Headquarters. Probably rewarding us with important mission. Well, that should inspire the crew. I'm going up the bridge. Yes, sir. Inform the crew. Yes, sir. Did you hear, everyone? We don't get to choose to where to go on the battlefield. Saipan ,Tinian, Iwo Jima. One after another. Okinawa, too. Today, it fell into enemy hands. Now with the enemy nearing the mainland, the decisive battle is coming. In other news at this critical time, I have been on submarine I-57 for three and a half years. We've destroyed a dozen enemy ships. More than the German cruiser Emden during the previous war. You should feel honored to be a crew member. May the burning spirit of Yasukuni inspire you to even great effort on our next mission! Penang, Malay Peninsula Kawamoto, you look tired. Yokota, maybe I can reset in a little while. Long time, no see. When did you get here? I flew in just this morning. Are things alright there? No, we could use more... Excuse me. So...there's our ace submarine commander. Submarine I-57 is to be assigned a special mission. I just arrived in Penang. Come on in. You and Yokota. Where were you two together last? When the Yamato sailed. Really... The sinking of the Yamato. Okinawa also fell... Captain Kawamoto? Where do you think the enemy will come next? A decisive battle on the mainland is most likely. Decisive battle? A decisive battle there will be an ugly thing. The decisive battle is a fight to the death. There will not be one Japanese left. Colonel Yokota! We must prevent that. These are your orders! General Headquarters orders that submarine I-57 immediately leaves for... western Africa Spanish territory and then proceed direct to the Canary Islands... where you will transport a special diplomat. For what purpose? To save Japan from destruction. To make peace. So Japan is ... Serviceman entering. Kawamoto, the commander felt only you could do this. That's why submarine I-57 was withdrawn from a combat mission. Are you talking about surrender? No, facilitate a peace agreement. How are peace and surrender different? It's not a simple problem of language. Right, it’s a serious problem. You are planning to surrender Japan. Wrong! It’s not that easy as that. What's so easy! Our men have died believing in Japan's victory. I believe that we soldiers, we brothers, will fight to the end. Clenching our teeth since Mongolia, we have worked hard for... So for the sake of the brethren... Colonel Yokota! You should kill yourself. Cowardice in the face of the enemy is punishable by death under military law. Wait, wait, please understand what the Colonel is saying. Don’t be so rash. No one can think straight about Japan's future with such intense feelings. Can't you both sit down? Captain Kawamoto, I also spoke rashly but you must listen carefully. Let me ask again. Wither everyone already on the front lines, I don't know... how Japan can continue the war. We're on the defensive everywhere. No food, no oil. Fire-bombing raids up and down Japan. The people are just steps away from starvation. Kawamoto, I believe in the glory of our people. But our people are hungry and dying. What glory is there in that? But there is still a way to save Japan. Fortunately, all this Japanese suffering... has not yet been realized by the enemy. They think we still have the means to resist. If we fail to take advantage of the opportunity for peace at this time, Japan will surely perish. The last opportunity to prevent that is about to be opened soon: The Potsdam Conference. Now is the last chance to end the war on our terms. In Switzerland, there is the Dulles organization for the US which led Italy to peace and helped create the United Nations. The Army and Navy are are being pushed back everywhere. The government is paralyzed by indecision even though Japan is close to total destruction. I do not know if you know realize this but calls for a “bamboo spirit” justifies the government telling the people anything. Against the whole world they say “The decisive battle of the mainland will give us victory." "Make do with less. Do not get caught up in enemy defeatist plots." The situation is no longer bearable. I have been presenting this every day to our European ambassadors and military officers. But there is a limit to what I can do. So we've found a person of stature in the international community. Who is that? Mr. Berger Berger? He was recommended as someone who could stop the war. His diplomatic knowledge and skill as a negotiator are internationally recognized. He will soon be arriving secretly from Singapore. Kawamoto, this must be treated as top secret. Moreover, the situation is time-sensitive. How many large submarines are left that can make it to the Atlantic? I-57 alone. Who else can fulfill this critical task? You alone, Captain Kawamoto. A person who dies in war dies like a dog with a prayer for the prosperity of Japan on their lips. War is not an individual problem. The fate of the country is at stake. Our soldiers are now dying not for victory but to save the country from destruction. We must seek an advantageous peace. It is up to us to make this happen. Kawamoto, the future of Japan rests on your abilities and determination. Please consider this, Kawamoto! I thought that if you understood... When do we sail? I'll do it. Kawamoto! I-57 accepts the mission and will depart for the Canary Islands. Thank you. Let me explain further. The past events and future strategy are recorded in your orders here. From our current location here in Penang your destination is Paloma Island here. Following a thorough investigation of the area, we have selected that as the safest place. Arrival Day: August 4th Greenwich International Standard Time 02:00 Send a 'Z' signal from offshore at the planned landing area. I will also have an oil tanker there so that you can refuel for the return. Captain, I was not part of that decision. I can't accept it. How can we do something like this? Captain, you were given a surrender document. Are you going to carry it? Captain, you have been tricked. Japan's survival depends on an errand to drop off someone... on the other side of the world! Shit! Why did headquarters think this was a good idea? Captain, please refuse the mission. The men will mutiny. Is that everything you wanted to say? Captain! That’s all I want you to say. But, still... I-57 has 70 crew members with the same opinion as me. I wonder why. Then I will do this alone Captain. Captain! My responsibility is to follow the commander’s orders. To discipline the men to do the same. There is nothing else. So you do understand? I must try to the very end. I think a military man should be like that. I was taught to fight. I am a man who only knows to fight. And that's good. I can't go to the Atlantic with a executive officer who can't fight. Shimura, I'm asking you. Clean all that up quickly. Finish the fueling. Yes. How is it? Nothing unusual. Be careful Yes How many torpedoes have you loaded? Eight. Do not salute inside the boat. Yes! Hurry up. Engineering department, ready for departure? Why so few torpedoes? We're only carrying eight. Chief? What? Our mission doesn't require more. Do you know what the mission is? No, because it’s top secret. What do you think it is? Maybe in the middle of the Atlantic, the Allied leaders are all gathered on a battleship. We go find the battleship and ka-blam sink it! But it’s in the Atlantic Ocean. Fuel will be the problem. So why is it necessary to have fewer? When you get there, the torpedo department will be ready. Six is plenty to do the job. That all seems to fit. Alright! Keep at it. Hey, Maruta. Yes How is his stomach? I took him to the doctor. It seems he ate too many bananas. Take care of him. He's our good luck charm. Yes. Lift! Wait, leave Teruko ... I mean, leave number 3. What did you call it? Oh, nothing ... Sounded like “Teruko”. It did? Yes. My third daughter is named Teruko, too. I have six daughters. I'm proud of all of them. The year before last ... when I went home on leave, the eldest Namiko became a bride. My feeling at that time was the same as when I release a torpedo. I take care of all the torpedoes as though they were my daughters. In numerical order: Namiko, Asako, Teruko, Kinuko then... Oh...Fujiko and Masako. Same as my daughters. They may all look alike but each is just a little bit different from the others. Please, may I have one as my own bride! OK, give me the monkey. Kin-Chan! Idiot, that's no daughter! I'm sorry. No, it’s a bastard. This mission generally requires radio silence... to avoid being caught by the enemy's radio direction finder. Do not make any transmissions except... briefly asking for any orders from base. But be especially quick in that case. Yes, Chief. Departure in 5 minutes. Departure in 5 minutes. Attention! Salute! Report. 19 people under Maeda Kazuo transferring to Penang Base. I'm sorry to have to send off hard-working men like you. But you know how things are now. As an Imperial Navy sailor, you go when and where you're ordered. I pray for each of you good heath and good luck! Depart from the ship. Thank you for helping me. Miyamoto, do your best. Yes. Everyone has done well. I'm fine. Chief Maeda. Yes. Give this to Sanada Yokota. Yes. Ready for departure. Understood. Thank you for everything. Watch out. Do your best! Do your best! Dive. Dive! I know you find it very hard to understand why your captain would leave you behind. I asked him to do so because it would speed the completion of his mission. The captain asked that you remember the line from the song "Sakura Sakura". "The remaining cherry blossoms are also scattered." To the barracks now. Get plenty of rest. Salute! You can't tell whether we're on the surface or underwater. How long will it take to leave port? We've stopped? Engine failure? The Captain will take care of it. Chief! What? There's some talk about a new weapon called "matchbox". Have you heard of it? Um, I've heard something. What is it? I heard it’s about the size of a matchbox. It could blow up everyone in Okinawa in one shot. It’s a new kind of bomb. That’s it. This is a top-secret secret. Excuse me You cheap bastard! Yes Leaving port Let me introduce This is Mr. Berger This is his daughter, Miss Milene I have guaranteed their safey on your behalf. I wish you success. This way, please. Orderly. A woman came. A woman. Are you a woman? Wake up! Get up, get up Woman. Woman. A woman aboard! Woman? Yeah, a foreign woman is aboard. You lie. No, it’s true Really, through the front wardroom I saw her myself. It's a woman! A woman! A woman! It’s a woman! It’s a woman! Hey, settle down. Where is this woman? I'd like to see her for myself. Korat Harada Yes You bastard! Matchbox? I was right. The woman had one! Idiot! It's Nakazawa. I can’t discuss our mission. But the captain is committed to this operation. There are extraordinary things taking place. I trust the captain. You must trust me. I-57 has always been the best submarine in the Japanese Navy. That's still true. Nothing has changed. Has it, Chief Engineer? How about you, Navigator? Communications? Deck officer? What is it? These two foreigners seem to be French. Maybe. So our mission is political, I think. Maybe. So... I only tell you this because I know you so well. I understand your anger. It reminds me of when I was young officer. You think that everything is about fighting? That there's all there is to it? So I'm warning you. Don't say anything more. You won't hear any more from me. Good. And keep an eye on the men. Everyone listen! I'm wondering a lot about the purpose of this operation, too. But keep your guesses to yourself. Your superiors know what they're doing. Understand? Carry on! Keep your guesses to yourself. Your superior knows what he's doing. Understand? I can't hear you! Okay. Your superior knows what he's doing. Understand? No one is lower that you. You're a dead end. Hydrophone sweeps are clear. Very well. Continue listening. Depth 30. Depth 30. This looks good... What is that, an egg? Where did you do get an egg? It was for the foreign woman. She didn't want it. Is that so? I'm so happy for you. Takashi, you lack proper fighting spirit! Spread your legs. Clench your teeth. Alright... Yamano I am a doctor. I'm happy that the patient's illness is cured. The orderlies carry what they carry. I'm glad someone will eat it this time. It doesn't matter who. But...! Abe. When you meet the enemy, you should do so with a nice face. You can go. 20 seconds left. 15 seconds left...10 seconds left... 5 seconds left Time! Not very much. This too. This too. This is the same. Wow, this is amazing. A lot of dirt. That’s how to do it. Maruta! Special distribution. This is my water. I'll give it to you as a special prize. Yes, there is nothing better than this. I accept the gold medal. Hey, unusual idea. Yes, bathe. 81 degrees Then we are about 4 or 5 days ahead of schedule. If you have the time, would you like to stop in Gibraltar? In the middle of the enemy port and... I have a request. Another one? The same in fact, Miss Milene "I want to wipe my body". One cup of water is not enough. Would you give me more water? What? Tell her to be patient. However... Enough, it would affect morale. Captain, please. I should ignore my executive officer? Yeah. Your bedside manner is not charming enough. Try harder to make her understand. I'll go back. Good luck, Doctor. Wait, the water. Where did you get that? From the storage tank. The storage tank? What for? The foreign woman needs to be bathe. What? Even as a Chief Petty Officer, I’m using a drop of water daily. Who the hell ordered that! Who? A senior officer and the doctor. Senior officer? OK, go! Left face. You have had to endure hard times. You must take better care of yourselves. To inspire morale, each of you will peek through the keyhole one by one. Monk. You first. Yes...no.. I don't want to... What's wrong with you? Did your wife keep your manhood? But I ... Chief, why don't you... No, I won't. It's not my water. That’s why you guys get to peek. It's your water. It is only fair to entertain your eyes a little bit. Niizo...Ihara...Takashi Stop! What are you doing? You are the elite of the Imperial Navy! Officers can have a glass of water. This foreign woman gets to bathe thanks to you. The enlisted men who must quietly make do with little water who are the elite of the Imperial Navy! Left face. Forward! Wait! Deck officer. Sweet sweet, eh? These are for you. Abe. Come here. Take them out of your pocket. So, lovestruck with this foreign woman. No The shame of the Imperial Navy! Why do you strike this man? Go back to your rice cooking. Have you ever faced the enemy? I dare you to say that again! You want a fight with me? Idiot! You bastard! Chief, I was wrong. Chief, I was wrong. Please stop. Stop this! You will all stop fighting! You men have seen life and death together. The Captain depends on each of you to complete this mission That requires everyone to work together. That is the spirit of the warrior. Have you forgotten! Never before have I seen such a thing on a ship. Takeyama. Tell me how this started. Tell me! It was my fault. Shut up! ... The cause is the woman. What? Since the woman came aboard, I've become obsessed. The men of I-57 are all rattled! Really... Sir, tell everyone our mission. Sir, this incident would not have happened if we knew what our mission is. Isn't that right? To your posts. Get in there. Hurry up! Depth 60, hurry! Depth 60, hurry! Stop engines. Rig for depth charges. Stop engines. Rig for depth charges. Destroyer approaching. Down scope... O'Brien class. 40... 50... Depth 60, trim. Depth 60, trim. Rig for depth charges. Rig for depth charges. Here we go... There! Sound contact approaching quickly, 30 degrees left. Destroyer passing overhead. Captain, we should attack. Think about our mission. Yes ... But ... Depth 80. Depth 80. Now! Now is the time to attack! With so few torpedoes, we cannot be reckless. With six torpedoes, I can guarantee at least two hits. Look, a mouse. Where? Mouse or rat? Rats are worse enemies than destroyers. Come out! Ah, it was there. Flooding at the forward hatch. Go. Damage report. Aft torpedo room flooding. Depth 30 Repair party to aft torpedo room, hurry! The enemy seems to have turned around. Approaching now. Depth 60. Depth 60. Captain, let’s attack. High-pressure pump failure. What! Up scope. OK, ahead standard speed. Ahead standard speed. Make the depth 17. Make the depth 17. Increase depth 25. Rudder 80 degrees. Rudder 80 degrees. Captain, what are your intentions? To slip behind him. Torpedo battle. Torpedo battle. We're attacking! Flood tubes. Down scope. Azimuth 20 degrees to the right. Azimuth 20 degrees to the right. Set speed 30. Set speed 30. Distance 1500. Distance 1500. We'll fire from tubes 1 and 2. Make the running depth 10 feet. Running depth 10 feet. Final bearing. Forward torpedo room ready to fire. Forward torpedo room ready to fire. Ready...Fire! Sinking. A torpedo hit! Oh, over there. Hey, did you catch it? You bastard. How is it? I caught the team leader. Yeah, well done! You merit an apple. Thank you! Surface. Blow main tanks. After we surface, immediately check all rear vent valve seals. Repair party, standby. Abe, you look at the number 7 vent. How is it? Give me a wrench. Look here. Shut up. This packing is coming out here, too! Good, hurry up and replace it. Right 10 degrees, aircraft! OK, Prepare to dive. Stop working, come in! Stop working! Right 10 degrees, aircraft! Stop working! Abe, stop working. Hurry up, it’s an airplane. Yes Abe, hurry! Hurry up! If this is not done right, air will leak. If it leaks, bubbles appear on the surface. Even if the valve is fixed, I-57 is in danger! Hurry up! There, done. Captain, Abe is missing. What! Abe... Down scope. Captain! Engines ahead, half speed. Engines ahead, half speed. Commander... The radio room intercepted a message by the British Navy. It reads: 〝Under attack by a Japanese submarine.” They report - "One destroyer sunk." This doesn't make completing our mission any easier. I wonder what he else might have to do. The enemy will be looking for I-57 now. ♪ If I go away to the sea, ♪ ♪ I shall be a corpse washed up. ♪ ♪ If I go away to the mountain, ♪ ♪ I shall be a corpse in the grass ♪ ♪ But if I die for the Emperor, ♪ ♪ It will not be a regret. ♪ As your Captain, I can only say this: From his first day aboard until his last, the young Ichimizu Abe... served his ship and shipmates. For any sailor, it is a fitting end. Because of his trust in me as his captain, I will now tell you the current mission of I-57. We are transporting a special diplomat who will attempt... to obtain peace for Japan. I was chosen to lead this mission... and I now ask that you 50 men, the elite of the Imperial Navy, help to complete this mission. Captain? What? I understand. Did you hear him? The ship will carry the hope of peace. For all those who will go, step forward! Anyone? If peace is worth your life, step forward! Captain. We're with you. Dismissed. All hands back to work. Takeshi Yamano. Sir! Why did you not tell me this was for "peace"? I should have. We're all in this together. Either we succeed or die. A peace mission for a warship. Is there no contradiction? There must not be. Sir. Please let me die gloriously. Don't be in a rush. Just follow me, okay? One destroyer the latest sacrifice to this bloodbath. Not even halfway there yet. And two days behind schedule. Message received from base. Read it. "Enemy aircraft based in Cape Town searching for you." "Remain outside enemy patrol radius of 200 nautical miles." Understood. Off the coast of Cape Town, would you go out 300 nautical miles? Dangerous. It's in the middle of a storm zone. On the contrary, it will be safer. I feel fine. I feel fine. Don't fight the sway. Come on! This storm is nothing. Why can't we dive now? The batteries have to finish charging first. It feels like they've been charging for ten days. A battery has to eat just like you eat rice. Don't talk about rice! Be quiet! Okay, who's ready to eat? Nice and hot. Thank you for your consideration but... Too hot for you? No, It's not that. I was born in the snow country. I can't take this heat. God, it's hot. From snow country on the outside but he sweats from the inside. Enough! Ten years I've been in the Navy. First time anyone turned down my delicious rice. Too sick? Too bad. Go over there! I think I'm okay because I swayed so much in the womb. You need to get your sea-legs. Try standing up, moving with the ship. How is it? I feel better. Okay, then go up to the bridge. Sway with the ship a little more. This is rough. A ungodly wind is blowing in this misable place. Chief engineer says battery charging is complete. Aye! Do you want to dive? We'll get wrecked if we stay on the surface. Okay, let's dive. It’s unavoidable that our speed will drop. Lookouts, down. We're diving. Navigator, dive. Dive! Clear the deck. Dive. Depth 60. Finally..."Dive" time. The Captain seems to have answered your prayers. I don't know who did and I don't care. Hey, fire extinguisher! The Potsdam Declaration; the Allies have decided to exterminate Japan. There's still time for peace or do you feel otherwise? Accept the Potsdam Declaration as soon as possible. There is no other way to prevent the destruction of the motherland. Recall I-57 immediately. When the storm stops, airplanes fly. We dived just in time. The enemy has more gasoline than we have battery power. Air is more important than battery and we're running out of them both. I want to breathe fresh air. Harada, what are you doing? I'm saving some air. Fool, don't you realize you're still inside? What? No response? Keep trying. I-57 must immediately return to base. Chief, how many days will it take to complete the repair? I think it will take 5 days. 5 days? That's crazy. How much carbon dioxide? 2.8 percent. Hydrogen levels are still okay. Chief. What? I want you to make about ten pounds of ice. What? Miss Milene has a fever of 104. You want me to turn off all cooling? She has acute meningitis. We have to get her fever down. No, the ship is already over 85 degrees now. Think about the effect on the crew. I calculated the energy saved if the temperature inside the ship is allowed to go to 100 degrees for six hours. Could make the entire crew sick. The crew can take it. No. As a doctor, what I am saying is correct. And what I am saying as a superior officer is more correct. I understand. Captain. Speaking. I told the doctor that he had to see you first. And only after careful consideration of the effect on the crew. I told him I would not approve. I thought you should know. Doctor. I am against it but we'll make the ice. I was moved by the sincerity of my executive officer. Thank you very much. New orders. Yes. Shut it off. Air conditioning for only a few minutes every two hours. The engine room already is the hottest. The officers will be comfortable enough. You can rot in the heat. Kanehara Don't salute inside the ship. If you move around slowly, you'll feel a little cooler. The ward room will also feel cooler. Two or three degrees cooler. Sir, why did you come here? Well, I... I was trying to cool off. It's hot! Be quiet! Hot! Please be patient for a while longer. It's hot! I heard something! You're crazy, I can't hear anything. We've consumed that much fuel? Somehow. Captain, if you draw a straight line on the map... we can just make it back to Penang. Captain, if we make it to the Canary Islands, will the oil tanker still be waiting for us? If there is any miscalculation, it is clear that the ship will not be able to return to Japan. Are we going to the Canary Islands or back to Penang? You must decide here and now. Very well then.. continue towards the Canary Islands as planned. Even if we can't return to base, we must make every effort to complete our mission. It is the choice of each of you along with my own as Captain. Thank you all. Each division leader must relay this decison to their men. Dismissed. Doctor. When you see him, do not tell Mr. Berger we have no return fuel. All this for ice. Up you ass! Making ice to cure some woman's illness. We may never be able to return to Japan. Sooner or later, we end up on the bottom of the sea. But at least those two foreigners must land safely. What good does that do any of us? I'll say it clearly, I still don't understand... what good carrying these two foreigners does any of us. We're on a one-way messenger errand. An Imperial Navy submarine... reduced to delivering some mail. I just want to get this over with. It’s better to die for something... than die for nothing. How about you? Let's give them their ice. OK, let's do it! Yeah, good. And maybe some dried squid. Dried squid? I can't stop thinking about food. Shut up! Commander, the Prime Minister's response in a newspaper article, July 30th. "The Potsdam Joint Declaration is just a re-hash of the Cairo Conference.” "The government sees nothing new or worthwhile in it and will ignore it.” "They intend to just kill us all and end the war thay way.” Is this right? What happens to Japan now? I-57 is still not responding? Still nothing. It's useless...useless to go on. General Headquarters message. Read it. "There is a problem with the strategy of relying on one person." "Recall submarine I-57 immediately." What are we to do about I-57? Continue trying to contact them for one week. If still nothing, we must unfortunately then give up. Three more days. Then, Captain, we can drop off these two people and get I-57 back in the war. I wonder if there's any fuel to be found in the Mediterranean. Captain, repair of the radio completed. OK, good work. He thinks she's 21. Same age as Teruko. No, 20. Same as Kinuko. Kinuko? What did he say? You are six times as great a father as he is. I disagree. Aircraft 30 degrees left! Enemy aircraft turning right, coming closer. OK, both engines stop. Crash dive. Both engines stop. Crash dive. Depth 50. Depth 50. Depth 50. It seems to be a patrol aircraft. Small bombs. I wonder if we've been discovered. Our mission may have become even more difficult. It may have radioed back our position. If there is any change in the situation at our destination, I'm sure base will contact us. It was base... that warned us about Cape Town. Well, we have to take that chance. Navigator. What is our current location? North 28 degrees 30 minutes, 17 degrees 30 minutes west. Exec? We made it. Attention all hands. After sailing more than 10,000 miles, on August 3, 23:30, we have arrived at Paloma Island, "Destination Z", at a point 6000 meters off-shore. The ship will surface for an expected landing time of 02:00. Until then, everyone remain at their post. We just need this one final push in order to complete our mission. Captain, five minutes before surfacing. Surface. Blow main tanks. Prepare to flash signal. Ready. Send 'Z' three times. Captain, I can’t see any oil tanker. August 4, Greenwich Standard Time. No doubt, 02:00 What could have happened? Any further signaling is dangerous. Agreed... Prepare to dive! Prepare to dive! Tomorrow at 02:00, we send the 'Z' signal again. If there is no response, we will send a scouting party ashore at the landing site. Decide who to send on the scouting party. Navigator, can we go in any closer? The reef is dangerous. We do not understand the present situation at all. In case of emergency, use this grenade. Drink. Ensign Yamano, come back safely. Stop signaling. Launch the scouting party. Launch the scouting party! Hurry up. Put it down. Dive. Both engines ahead. Navigator. How fast can four people paddle? About 3 knots. Stop! Did you hear that? Get down! Navigator. Time to sunrise? 1 hour, 20 minutes. 1 hour, 20 minutes. Sir, we're not headed in the right direction. I know. The submarine will be over there. We can't lead these patrol boats to the submarine. Paddle the other way, hurry! The scouting party is coming back. When they get to within 100 meters, surface. A patrol boat seems to be following them. Wait, now they're heading in the opposite direction. What! Ensign Yamano could not be mistaken about his course. Captain, Yamano is... Raise oars. Captain, any closer than that is dangerous. OK, hold our position here. Hold our position here. 120 degree left explosion. The scouting party committed suicide after Ensign Yamano determined they would be captured. Get as close to the shore as possible. Land those two people in rubber boats. Both engines ahead slow. Both engines ahead slow. Down scope. Captain, we're right next to the reef. Both engines stop. Both engines stop. Navigator. Distance to shore? 3000 meters. Get the two people in a rubber boat. We'll wait here. Depth 17. Periscope up. Depth 17 Captain, sound contact 130 degrees right, intensity 2. OK, continue to listen. It was hiding behind the cape. The enemy is a destroyer. Captain, let's attack it. Not yet. If we stay here, we'll be trapped. Both engines ahead slow. Captain, we'll hit the reef. Let's attack. Dead slow! Silent submarine! Dead slow! Sound contact 140 degrees right, intensity 3. Both engines stop. Both engines stop. Captain, the enemy is a destroyer. Our enemies can't come in here. We have to maintain our distance. We have to attack. There is no way to escape. Wait until we can land those two people. To land those two people, do you sacrifice 50 people? Landing those two people is our mission. What I'm trying to say is that we can't do that now. Sound contact fading, intensity 2. Captain, now? Damn it! It must be rocket-propelled depth charges. It is a new weapon. Stand-by to attack. Right engine ahead, slow speed! Torpedo room, stand-by! New contacts. New contacts! What? 20 degrees to the right Damage report. Forward torpedo room, no damage. Communications room, no damage. Engine room flooding! Captain, if the engine room floods we cannot move. I'll get the pumps started! Transfer water forward. Transfer water forward. Ready to transfer. Ready to transfer. Start pumps. Start pumps. Water transfer started. Opposite rudder. Water transfer started. Transfer 3 tons. Flooding here. Rear torpedo room flooding! Rear torpedo room flooding! Engine room, no damage. Ward room, no damage. Captain, what are you going to do! We're dying like a dog here, Captain. Surface at current position. Are you crazy? I can't let those two people die. If we surface, it's the same as surrendering. We'll hand them over to the enemy Captain, the purpose of this ship is to fight. You can take them. Prepare a white flag. Wait! Captain, are you going to surrender? How can you... Orderly, hurry! Torpedo battle, right! Fool! All hands, I'm going to fly a white flag before the enemy. At the same time, send this message in plain text: "From Captain, Japanese Imperial Navy submarine I-57, To Captain, Allied warship" "We want to deliver two civilians to you."

Captain, message from enemy ships. Read it. "From Captain, middle Allied warship" Which one? The one with two stacks. "1 - For handing over civilian personnel, a boat from both sides will be sent" "and the transfer performed on the beach" "2 - Don't move from your current position without further instructions." Reply, "I understand." Doctor, you are to take the two civilians to the beach. That will end our mission. You will then return immediately. We are going. Good luck. I pray for your safety! We're ready. Ready for departure. Hey, look at this. Captain, received message "You must surrender within five minutes of transfer completion." Understood.
