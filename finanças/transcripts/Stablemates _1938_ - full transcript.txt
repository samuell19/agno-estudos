- There she is. - The boss is watching. So do your best this morning, will you? A lot depends on it. Best two-year-old I've ever seen. Then she started stoppin'. Costs me my shirt. Come on, honey. Show 'em how good you are. She's moving along this morning, Mr. Gale. Yeah, well, she better show something this morning 'or she'll be in the glue factory this afternoon.' Don't stop, honey. Don't stop this morning. That's it, girl. Keep her going, honey. You did it, baby. You did it. I'll bet the boss' eyes are poppin' out of his head this morning. Give everything! That's it, girl. Ahh! - 145. - 145? I thought she was doing better than 145. Oh, gee, boss, that can't be. Your watch must be busted. '138. That's more like it.' Gee, didn't I tell you she was ready, boss? Pipe down, pipe down. If I thought she could do it again tomorrow 'I'd slip her in that fourth race.' Let me ride her, boss. She knows me and she likes me. 'Oh, we can't take any chances on you.' Do you think you can keep her moving? I'll keep her moving if I have to tear her rear end off. Oh, don't use a bat on her, Cliff. She'll give you everything. You're trying to tell me how to ride a horse? I'm not trying to tell you how to ride her. - But I know Lady Q. - Oh, alright, alright, Mickey. Don't feed her much tonight, nothing at all tomorrow. And give a little water every hour or so. And check her plates. If he uses a bat on you, Lady Q I'll punch him right in the nose. Hey, Mr. Gale, excuse me, can I speak to you a minute? - What about? - Uh, your horse. I'll see you later. I gotta run over the tack room. She ran that mile in pretty good time, didn't she, huh? Yes, if you call 145 good. About 139 or thereabouts. But that's no guarantee that she'll repeat. - You're gonna run her tomorrow? - What if I am? Well, I can, uh, I can ensure her winnin'. How could you? Well, I've got a little service that I render horse owners now and then. - Works like magic. - No so. My plans for the future don't include going to jail. Oh, there ain't a chance of that happening. It don't even show in the saliva. It's a special formula, all my own. The only cost to you is that you put ten bucks on her nose for me, that's all. I'll think it over. Where could I find you in the morning? I'll meet you over in back of the.. Thanks ever so much for the information. I'll, I'll get a bet down, Mr. Gale. - Thank you. - Oh, hello, Barney. Mr. Gale. Who is that fella? I don't know. Is anything wrong? No, just haven't seen him around before. Somethin' familiar about him. Oh, he just wanted the usual thing, a tip. - Did you give it to him? - I could use one myself. 'Come now, Lady, you'll, you'll have to turn in early.' 'Yes, ma'am. You get yourself a good night sleep.' 'There'll be a lot of people looking at you tomorrow' when you prance into that winner's circle. We don't want any circles under your eyes. Hey, does she sleep any better 'if you tell her a bedtime story?' What do you want? - Where can I find Mr. Gale? - 'Well, I couldn't say.' 'He's liable to be around almost any place.' What do you want with him? Oh, me and him's got a little business together. Well, he'll be around in the morning. You can see him then. Okay. Okay. I'll wait. Not in here. You can come around at 7:00 in the morning. Hey, listen, I'm busted. You want me to sleep out there in the cold? Would you mind giving the guy a flop? Tonight I do. She's gotta run tomorrow and strangers make her nervous. Well, she won't mind me. I don't snore. Besides I'm here to help her win. - She don't need no help to win. - She don't? The only way she could win would be for all the other horses to drop dead. Now look here, you get out of here or I'm gonna call a stable cop. Yeah? 'Does the cop know that, uh' you and the Lady are keepin' house here? Now listen, buddy. If Mr. Gale knew that you was rude to me he'd be pretty sore. You just calm down and I promise not to tell him. I'll also promise not to break every bone in your body. Uh, come on, shrimp. Make up that straw. Ah, you make your own bed! I was talkin' about where you's gonna flop. I've made my reservation already. Hey, get on out of there. That's where I sleep. Oh, listen, real hospitality is when a host gives up his own bed 'to his guests, just like you're doing.' Listen, I'll get at you for this if it's the last thing I ever do. 'Yeah.' Oh, go pound your ear before I pound it for you. Why, you dirty rotten old tramp. Now ain't that nice coming from a little fella like you? You're looking at yourself 30 years from now. That's what comes from following the racehorses. Yeah, best thing ever happened to me since I went over the hill was getting that horse to take care of. Oh, cut out the schmooze and hit the hay. Nighty-nighty. You better not quit today. - I'll see that she behaves. - See that you do. Just take a look at that tote board, boss 'if you wanna feel good.' We'll need a wheelbarrow to carry the dough home, boss. - I hope so. - I'll check it in. - 'Alright.' - Number 8. And keep punching those $100 win tickets till I tell you to stop. Two ten dimes on Blue Comet. You has a wager there, my very good friend my bosom companion, you has a wager there. Hey, Snowball. What's the odds on Yellow Jack? That horse is 20 to 1, my friend. Well, an ace on the nose. # Yellow Jack is the horse to bet # # He's a good companion down the track ## 'The horses are at the post.' 'Number 5 Yellow Jack' 'and number 2 Blue Comet broke through.' 'They're lining up again and we might get a break.' Don't push. Come over here. Now you're gonna see how wrong a wrong guy can be. Lady Q's gonna romp home alone. Yeah, alone. Last. 'Come on with her, jock! Aah!' Oh, you, Lady Q, come on, my gal. Go on, honey gal! 'Lady Q has gone to the front of the rail.' 'Blue Comet at second by a head and Foxy Jim.' 'Round the first turn, it's Lady Q' 'leading by four lengths..' You do it now. Ha-ha. Go with her, jock. 'Lady Q's still leading by seven lengths' 'Blue Comet in second.' Go on, honey! 'Down to the back stretch, it's Lady Q now in front.' She's stoppin'. Lady Q is leading by about two lengths. Yellow Jack is just getting ready to make his move. 'Leading the race is Lady Q..' Yellow Jack is coming up behind her. Your sweetheart's beginning to wobble. 'It's Lady Q, Yellow Jack and..' Oh, you're nothing but a dirty jinx, that's what you are! She'll still take it. Come on, baby. Come on. 'Now Yellow Jack is moving to the front between the horses.' Come on, break their hearts. Shove dirt in their eyes. 'Lady Q is third and fading.' Oh, Yellow Jack should be leading by a length by now. Come on, Lady. Come on, turn on the heat, honey. Turn on the heat. Come on. 'The results of the race up here on the totalizator.' The trouble with that horse is she's sick. Hey, Yellow Jack was my baby. I recall it sadly, my very good friend. One dollar at 20 to 1 makes $21 and now we're done. In fact, I is finished. I won't need you anymore, kid. - You won't need me no more? - That's right. - Take her. - Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Gale. Lady Q can't get along without me. She'll get along alright where she's goin'. She won't need a swipe in the boneyard. You mean you're gonna destroy her? Why, certainly, I'm not gonna feed her another meal. Well, gee, that's murder. Why, it's almost like killing a human, Mr. Gale. You couldn't do that. She's only a horse, she doesn't understand. What did she ever do to you? Nothing but robbed me of my bankroll. On second thought, we won't destroy her. Gee, thanks, Mr. Gale. We'll send her over to the lion farm. See if the lions can stomach her. Oh, wait a minute, look. I saved up $86. And you owe me six weeks' pay, that's $30 more. I'll give you all that if you let me take her. - Please let me take her. - What would you do with her? How do you expect to feed her? Or are you gonna eat her yourself? Well, you don't care what happens to her, do you? - No, so take her. - Gee, thanks. I don't wanna see either of you again. - You're jinxes, both of you. - Oh, thanks a lot. Gee, girl, you're mine! Come on, hon. Here. Come on. Oh, baby. Bo-boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. Why didn't they tell me that the brakes was loose? Why did you steal it? Oh, this costs heavy sugar, heavy sugar. She only gone 86,000 miles. Engine's just as tight as a drum. Where are you goin'? I'm gonna change my shirt.. ...and I'm gonna celebrate and, and then hit the room. Hey. You heist that buck out of my pocket this morning? Oh, was that your buck? Now ain't that funny? Just as I was leaving there is that buck laying right there in the straw on the doorstep. And from its position, I didn't know whether it was your dough blown out or somebody else's dough blown in. - So I says, I... - Yeah. Yeah. - Come on, give it over. - Huh? The buck, come on, give it to me. Frogskin, one buck. There it is. If Mr. Gale had done what I'd told him to do why, he'd be in the money like I am. Anyway, if he comes around here asking for me you just tell him I got other plans now. Yeah, well, he won't be around. She don't belong to him no more. - 'Who's stuck with her now?' - She's mine. Give me half of what she earns and I'll fix her so she'll win a race. I don't care if she races or not. He was gonna send her to the glue factory. How could you fix her up? Give her a little shot of ginger juice in her leg. 'It'll make her faster than lightning.' Why, you mean that you'd dope her? You'd do a dirty thing like that to an animal? Why, get your stuff and get out of here. Okay, okay, I was only trying to help you out. Why, she's champy material if I know anything about horses. Why, look at that ranging neck, that short back and straight clean legs. But she's sick. You're always harping on that. What do you mean she's sick? Hey, don't go in there. She don't like strangers. - She's liable to kick you. - I'll take a chance. Attagirl. Ah. Mm-hm. Yeah. I thought so. You heard of Skeeball, ain't you? Hmm, who ain't heard him? Holds the all-time record for a mile and a quarter. Yeah, that's right. Well, I figure that she's got the same thing that he had. What same thing? Well, when Skeeball was a two-year-old he had a tumor as big as a marble right under his left front hoof there. Every time he put his foot down, it hurt him. Just like I think it hurts her, that's all. Oh. How'd he win so many stakes? Oh, there was a.. There's a vet around there, a young fella. Smart as a whip until he got in with a lot of gamblers and they got him in a jam. Yeah, so what happened? Well, this young vet, he operated on Skeeball. It was a tough operation too. - Hmm. Tough, how? - Well, he.. First, he had to remove a section from the wall of the hoof and then there was that growth. Now the trick was slicing that off without injuring the nerve. You see, if he cut a 1000th of an inch too much they'd had to send a $100,000 horse to the glue factory. - Did he do it? - Did he do it? Sure, he did it. And he nursed that old horse through the fever that follows an operation like that. And the next year, they won more money with Skeeball than you and me could even count. Do you think it hurts Lady Q just to walk on it? Well, how does it feel when you've got a pebble in your shoe? - Where is that vet now? - Hm? Oh. Oh, he's dead. 'I gotta go wash up.' Well, thanks for the Southern hospitality. Keep her feet off the ground. Hey, wait a minute. I'm going with you. Not where I'm going. They don't, they don't sell to minors. Oh, I could drink sarsaparilla. Oh. Even the sound of that word makes me sick in my stomach. Go away. Go away. - Good evening. - Hello. Haven't been around the track very long, have you? Oh, I ain't gonna be here much longer either. Well, so long, kid. I knew your face is sort of familiar. We've met, haven't we? Not that I know of unless my back was turned. - Well.. - Well, goodbye, mister.. - 'Mister..' - Goodbye, mister. I know that guy. I must be getting old. I can't remember who he is or when or where. - What's his name, kid? - Search me, Barney. I never did bother to ask him. Say, excuse me, will you? I'm gonna see somebody about somethin'. - Here's your chaser. - Make mine sarsaparilla. - Oh. - How are you makin' out, doc? - What did you call me? - Oh, you can't kid me. That vet you were talkin' about, you are him. Where'd you get that idea? Well, you got a set of vet's tools. - Who, who has? - You have. I saw 'em. I went through your bindle. Don't you know it's against the law to go through a man's private possessions? Oh, I will put it this way, they were on the doorstep and they started to blow in or out, I don't know which. Well.. ...I won them shooting craps. I was just gonna hawk 'em when things got real tough. Oh, that's a lot of baloney. They're yours. You know too much about horses to be one of them ordinary guys. Why, you can call that race today with your back to the track. Well, I've been around racetracks and racehorses all my life. And you knew what was the matter with Lady Q the first time you saw her yesterday morning. Oh, I was only kiddin' you, that's all. You even said she had a tumor under her hoof just... - I was lyin'. - Oh, you weren't lyin'. I was lyin'. Skeeball didn't have nothin' under his hoof. Hey, you guys, if you want to argue, go hire a hall. Oh, you keep away from me. Go jump in that sarsaparilla and drown. Hey, thinkin' it over, I guess I ought to apologize for sayin' that you were a vet and that those tools were yours. Alright. alright, okay. Just forget it. I guess the reason why is 'cause I got so much respect for vets. Oh, they'll be glad to hear that. You know why? Because they love animals. And any guy that loves animals must be a right guy. - Is that the way you feel? - Certainly. Animals are swell. They need you. They never hurt you and they love you to death. They-they don't ask you who you are or what you are, do they? You bet. Another reason why I respect vets so much is, well, bein' able to tell what's the matter with an animal is hard. - Yeah. - It's not like a man. All's he has to do is go to a doctor and stick out his tongue and say aah, then he says "I got a pain here, I got a pain there." You know, but an animal, he can't do that. - He can't tell where it hurts. - No. That's why I always say that vets is better than doctors. You bet your pants they are. I'm gonna be a great vet when I grow up. - Does it take much studyin'? - It certainly does. You've got to study, stu.. Oh, how do I know? Hey! Come here! Gee, that was a narrow squeak. Oh, he didn't scare me at all. Hey, how did you cure that fever of Skeeball's after the operation? Oh, how did I cure him? Oh, I sit up with him nights and put cold water packs on him 'that's how.' Now take me some place where I can get a drink, will you? Okay. - Well, here we are. - Uh, wait, wait. What's, where.. What's.. What.. What's, what's your hur.. What.. Hey, hey. Don't pull me. Don't pull me. Hey. Hey. Hey, hey! What's.. What's the idea? Why are you bringin' me back to this place? Will you do it, doc? Will you, please? - Do what? - Will you operate on Lady Q? - Please, doc. - Well, what are you talkin'? Go, go away. Get out of here. I'll pay you, doc. How much do you want? - Oh, $2000. - I'll get it. I'll steal it. I will, doc. So help me. Well, you better steal a lot more while you're at it because my price has just gone up to $5000. Why, that operation probably wouldn't be worth five cents. I wouldn't let you do it if you wanted to. An old gin-soaked has-been like you, you'd probably kill her if you got close enough to breathe on her. - Say, I got a mind to... - Ah, you ain't got a mind. The only mind you got is fooling around in alcohol. Why, your hands are shakin' like jelly. Look who thinks he can do an operation. Oh, boy, you're killin' me. Killin' you ain't a bad idea. Why, you couldn't even operate a slot machine. Ah, you're through, you're washed up. - You're a has-been. - Who's a has-been? I can do just as good now as I did then. I'm no has.. Oh, you're a pretty smart kid, ain't you? You think you'd get me mad and then I'll go do that? Well, I got more sense. I won't do it. Oh, why won't you help us, doc? Because that horse don't mean nothin' to me and you mean less, that's why. Gee, doc, you got a chance to do something great. She was good once, you can make her good again. It's, well, it's-it's like a big shot ridin' on top of the world and all of a sudden gets a tough break and goes down. Along comes a good guy like yourself, doc and pulls this fellow up and puts him back on his feet again. You know, if you've ever had a tough break in your life, doc you might realize what a tough break she's havin' now. Did you ever see anything more beautiful? She'll do anything you want without a question bein' asked. And I'll bet that growth is killing her with pain but she'd run her heart out for me if I only asked. I, I guess that's what you call a thoroughbred. Only thoroughbreds got hearts like that and and if we don't help her, we ain't got any at all. I'm not askin' you for myself, doc and you can even have her if you'll only do something... Oh, shut up. Shut up. Here. You go and get some chloroform and some bandages and some cotton and some of that-that canned heat and stop on your way back and pick up a feedbag. - Alright. - And I'll cure your horse. But I ain't forgotten how disrespectful you spoke to me. And after it's all over, I'm gonna give you a beatin' that you'll remember the rest of your life. - Now you remember it. - Alright. Well, doc, don't you think you better lay off of that? Alright. Scram. Gee, it's hot in here. Get me that pail of drinking water outside, will you? Yes, sir. Now lock that door. We don't want anyone bustin' in on us here. Yes, sir. Put a lot of cotton in the bottom of that feedbag. Hurry it up. Give me the bottle of chloroform. Alright. Here, Lady. Hold, Lady. Come on, girl. Attagirly. Attagirl. Hold, girly. Hold, girly. Atta, nice girl. Atta, good girly. There you are. Watch out for when she comes down. Hold it, girl. Put some more chloroform in that bag. Gee, doc, there ain't much left. There it is. The growth just like I said it was. Is it, doc? Everybody, out. Everybody, out. - Turn out that light. - But we need lights, doc. We can't leave her like this. You want me to land in the jail? Anybody catches me doing this, I go to can. Why? You ain't doin' nothin' wrong. Put out.. 'Everybody, out.' 'Everybody, out.' 'Everybody, out.' I ought to scram out of here. What am I doing this for anyway? Gee, doc. Oh, you can't back out on us now, doc. - How can I work in the dark? - Oh, he's gone now. - I'll turn on the light. - No, no, no, you don't. No. Here, I got something here. Yeah, here it is. Come on, doc, please. I can't. I can't. I.. I'm forgetting. I'm forgetting... Oh, doc, you've gotta remember, please. - I don't know. - You're a good vet. You made a champion out of a cripple. - No. - You can do it again, doc. You've got to go through with it. Come on, doc. Uh, I, uh.. - I need a drink. - Oh. Get me a drink out of that pail. Go on. I'll be alright. I needed that. Hand me that scalpel. The knife. What are you shaking about? Pull yourself together. Keep that light going. Keep it going. Keep it going. I'm tryin', doc. Well, it's done. I don't think I touched the nerve at all. Gee, doc. Get that bandages ready. Come on. Keep that light up. Keep that light up. You want her to get an infection? Keep it going now. I think she's comin' out of it, doc. That's alright. Alright. She's alright now. We got to watch out for fever. You.. Get that blanket out of there in those gunny sacks and put 'em all over and keep her warm. Hey, hey, doc. What's the matter? Hey, get up. Hey, listen. Don't pass out on me now. Lady Q, she'll die. I don't know what to do for her. Hey, doc! Wake up, will you? Please. Oh, doc. Oh. Oh. Oh, buddy. Pretty good job, doc. Oh, you, you're hungry, huh? Want your breakfast? We'll fix that alright. Yeah. Gee, doc, are you sure this sea water treatment we're gonna give her is the same thing that fixed Skeeball up? Of course. Sure. And she's gonna be alright then? Yeah. How many times you going to ask me that question? - I fixed her foot, didn't I? - You sure did, doc. Ha. So I'm an old has-been, huh? My hands shake like jelly, huh? You better get yourself set for a good beatin' because that's one I owe you, I'm gonna pay with a lot of interest. Look at her, doc. She's rarin' to go. Well, then let her go. - Yah! - Hey! Ha-ha! Yoo-hoo! 'Look at her, doc.' Woo! Now come on, honey. Whoopie! Yeehoo! We're a couple of flyin' fish. Gee-whiz, doc. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Woo-hee! Did you see her, huh? 'Ho, did you see her?' Maybe we got another Man o' War, huh? Yeah, she'll be the death of more bookmakers than you can bury in an afternoon. Okay, doc, I'm ready. What's the idea? That lickin' you were gonna give me. I guess I deserve it now. I gotta change my clothes before I catch cold. Oh, ain't you gonna do it? Sure, I am. I gotta get dried off though. I can't beat you up when I'm uncomfortable. Gesundheit. Oh, gosh, I didn't do it. Gee-whiz, I wish I had a drink. You ain't wished that for a long time, doc. No, sir, that's right. Well, I guess I've been so busy with Lady Q I didn't have time to think about it, huh? Someday I'm gonna pay you for all the work you've done on Lady Q. Any price you say. Yes, sir. Sure. When I read about our winning our first race why, then I'll send you my bill. - Send me the bill? - Yeah. Why, ain't you goin' with us to Burlington? No, no, no, she's alright now. I'd only be in your way. Gee, I, I thought you and me, we, we were partners? No, no. I don't hook up with nobody. I'll carry you on to the, the first big town and then I'll blow. Oh. Gosh, I, I don't know what I'll, uh, what she'll do without you. Oh, she'll be alright. All she needs is racing and you'll sure see that she gets that. We'd only get in each other's hair like a lot of dandruff. Well, maybe we wouldn't. Maybe it's natural for us to be together like, like ham and eggs, and pork and beans. Uh, frankfurters and sauerkraut? Sure. Doc, you could even be her trainer. Why, if anybody can make a top radar out of her, it's you. Oh, no, I couldn't get hooked up like that and be around a kid like you. I ain't dependable and then and I'm liable to bring you a lot of grief. You can't run out on us. Why, you and me, we're gonna make a lot of dough, see. Well, if Lady Q wins a race, why, maybe I can go to school and be a vet. - Are you serious about that? - I sure am. I wanna be a great vet like you, doc. Well, maybe you will be. Where's my shoes? Come on. Get my shoes. Yes, sure. We stickin' together? Well, we'll try it out a little while, huh? Yeah, come on, you get in there and get dressed so we can put Lady Q in the trailer and get all set to go. Okay, pop. - What did you just call me? - Pop. - Got any objections? - No. No. Just so long as you ain't disrespectful. Uh, say, it wouldn't be a bad idea if we kind of made it legal, huh? - Made what legal? - You bein' my pop. I ain't got no folks and you ain't got no kids. Oh-ho! Oh, what would that get us? It'll make our partnership sort of closer. Well, you, you figure that if we adopted each other then I wouldn't be able to run out on you if I want to. That's the way you think, huh? No, that ain't it. Okay. Let's drop it. You really mean that you'd like to have me be your old man? Yeah. I'd like that. Well, alright, give me your mitt. I, let's see now. I, Tom Terry, do legally adopt you as my legal son till death do us part. Now you say it. I, Michael.. - I don't know my last name. - Oh, that's alright. It'll be Terry in a minute, don't worry. I adopt you, Tom Terry, to be my legal father for keeps. That's it. Now, now, now that I'm your old man I'm gonna start right in bein' the boss. Now here's what we'll do. We'll run Lady Q, see, and we'll win some dough and that dough, we'll use for your schoolin'. - See. - Well, can I ride her, pop? Yeah, now, I don't.. Yeah, I guess, I guess. But now listen. When that is over, why, you're gonna quit foolin' around racetracks and get yourself an education, so you can be a vet. Gee, I'm a lucky guy. Oh, go on. - Hey! - What is it, pop? A tidal wave? Ice. Hey, pop, look! Oh! Oh, it sunk. How are we gonna get to Burlington now, pop? Did you ever hear about walking? - Look. - Hey, there you.. You think we ought to try to make it to the track, pop? Pop? Pop sounds good even in the rain. No, son, we can't get there tonight. We gotta get her out of this rain. I'll ask 'em in there. Maybe they'll let us use the barn. Uh, uh, they might say no. Come on. Oh, boy. Bring her on in here. This is swell. And a lanyard. Get those wet clothes off of her right away. Okay, pop. 'We can't have her catchin' cold. Come on.' Yeah, she's soakin' wet. Yeah, we'll get you nice and warm in just a minute. Now come on. Let's, uh, skin the old cat. - Attaboy. - There's my sweet girl. All we have to do now is to keep her warm. - Alright. - Yeah. That ought to take care of her. Yeah. It looks like you need takin' care of. Here, you're freezin' to death. Come on over here and squat down. - I'm alright. - Come on, come on. Stop your squawking. You don't have to do that, pop. It's alright. Now get that off of there. We certainly are taking the hard way to get to Burlington, ain't we? Oh, you'll forget all about this when she comes in with her first prize. You'll think that this was a bad dream that somebody else had. Then when you get to be a big successful vet and someone ask you to write the story of your life you'll even lead on like this is worse than what it was. Hold your head over here now and stop your squawkin' now. Attaboy. - That's swell, pop. - There. That'll keep you both warm. Well, now if I only had somethin' for you to eat now, huh? Hey, pop, nicks, nicks. We ain't got no fire to cook it with, anyway. Where there's chickens, there's eggs and vice-versa. - There you are. - Oh. What do you do with them raw, pop? You eat 'em like this. First, you take and you poke a hole in the north end, see. Then you poke a hole in the south end like that. See. Then you take it and bring it up to your kisser and inhale. Chicken thieves, eh? Oh, no, ma'am, we wouldn't do nothing like that. We just brought her in out of the rain. Oh, you're horse thieves, too, eh? Oh, no, lady. No, no. We own that horse legal. We ain't the kind that steals. - And what's that in your hand? - That? - I'm gonna call the sheriff. - No, no. - You don't have to. - No, no, you don't.. No, you don't have to do that. Why, we'll gladly pay you for any damage that we've done. Alright. $3. Well, we're just out of money now, but... 'Well, look, couldn't we work it off?' Look at my pop. I'll bet he could do the work of any two men. Alright, you harrow field for me tomorrow morning. All three of you. I shouldn't be doin' this. I certainly don't like the looks of you. Well, we've been out in the rain. I'll bet you look 100% better when you're all spruced up. I look just the same, wet or dry. I'll call you tomorrow morning at 5 o'clock and I expect you to be ready. Ha! Get up there. Hyah! Hey, ain't it your turn now? - Just about. - Well, come on and take over. Well, the job's finished, pop. Finished? Well, you little chisel. You let your old man do all the work, huh? Come on over here and take your beating like I said I was gonna give ya. Uh, well, you come over here and get me if you think you're man enough. Hey, hey, hey. Ooh! Oh-ho-ho, you're handy with your fist, ain't ya? Oh, this air is great. It makes you feel swell, lot of pep. Yeah, yeah, maybe there is something to this getting up early and workin', huh? Hey, there, look, pop! Yeah, don't she look good? Gee, I'll bet this country air is sure doing her a lot of good. Hello, honey. Hello, sweet pea. You know what, you know what I think we ought to do? What, pop? We ought to enter her right in a stake race. The, uh, the Brewster Handicap, the opening day, huh? Do you think she's good enough, pop? Sure, she's good enough. Well, we need, uh, an entry fee for that. Yeah, about 75 bucks. What are we gonna do? Rob a bank? Uh, I think maybe I can talk that old mummy into giving us a job around here. This farm could certainly stand a good simonizing job. Look at that barn. 'Oh, what we could do to that with a pail of whitewash, huh?' We ought to get ten bucks for throwing whitewash on that thing. - Sure. - And look at that picket fence. 'Look at the teeth that's missin'.' That'll at least bring us five bucks for doing a little dentistry on that. - Yeah, that's-that's 15 bucks. - Fifteen bucks. And will you look at that there lawn there? That needs a shave. Well, once over lightly, we ought to get two bucks for that. Well, that's 17 bucks right there, ain't it? Look at that tumbled down shed. - Why, it looks alright. - Yeah? Well, it looks like it's on the verge of a nervous breakdown to me. Oh. They ought to give us five bucks more for fixing that up, huh? Sure. Do you think you can talk her into it? Oh, sure, it's in the bag right now. I got a way with women. Come on. Oh, this, you certainly got a nice place here. Nice mortgage on it too. That food certainly smells delicious. While you're smelling it, make yourself useful. Start cutting that bread. You must be awfully lonely living out here all alone. I got a canary and a shotgun. Company and protection, all I need. Don't you ever feel the need of human companionship? Uh, I mean, uh, don't you ever get tired of living alone? I don't call having had five husbands living alone exactly. - Five husbands? - That's right. One at a time. They all passed on. Mr. Flanders right in the middle of spring plantin'. In looking over your place, madam we noticed that the barn needs whitewashing and of course, that would, that would be worth about, uh, ten bucks. 'And then the, the picket fence' that, uh, that needs about $5 worth of mending and then, the, uh, the, uh, the-the lawn... Five dollars for the barn, two for the fences. Lawn's ain't worth more than 50 cents a piece. Well, those are my terms. Take them or leave them. $62.40. That ain't bad for a month's work, pop. Not bad, but still we're $12.60 short of enough for the entry fee though. Well, we got a few days before the meet begins. Mm, but all the painting and cleaning's done now. Well, how are we gonna raise the rest? Mm, that window could stand a little repair job. I wouldn't wanna suggest it though. But I'll get that money, don't you worry. - I'll get it, I'll get it. - Okay, I'll leave it to you. Yeah. What you wanna do is to hitchhike right up to Burlington and get an entry blank right away. Startin' this minute. It'll be a great day, won't it, pop? Yes, sir. When she prances into that winner circle and they put that wreath around her neck, oh! Well, that would be fine, too, but I was thinking about the day when, when, when they hand out those vets' diplomas and you'll be sitting there. Right at the front row. And that guy with the square piece of cardboard on as beanie says, "Dr. Michael Terry, come up here and get yours. "And if you try real hard, you might be half 'the vet that your old man is."' Oh. Go easy on that baloney. Oh, what are you makin' me hang around here for? I could've been halfway to Burlington by... - Well, get going! - Well, I'm gonna go. Oh, who are you pushin', huh? You wanna get chopped, huh? - 'I'll be back by evening!' - So soon? Can't I get rid of you? 'Ah, you'll be seeing me!' Oh, you're, you're jealous, huh? No, no, no, no, no. He'll be back real soon, huh? You kind of like him, don't ya? So do I, yeah. Uh, oh! 'Oh-oh, what's the matter with that foot of yours?' 'Here.' Hm. Little tender, huh, baby? Well, a bar shoe will fix that up alright. I want you tonight. What's the matter? Oh, her hoof hurts her a little bit. But don't tell that kid of mine when he comes back... - Where'd he go? - Went up to Burlington. We're gonna put her in the handicap. - You're leavin' here? - Yeah, yeah. You're, you're gonna be rid of us in a couple of days. Did you say you want me to do something for you tonight? - What voice do you sing? - Huh? Tenor or baritone? Strictly bass, lady. I'm having a sing at the house. You'll join us. Oh, no, I, I couldn't go up there with these old clothes on. Well, you're about the same size Mr. Flanders was. You can wear a suit of his. Deadman's clothes? He wasn't dead when he bought them. # Me me me me me me me ## - Hiya, Mickey. - If it ain't Sherlock Holmes. - How's the snoopin' business? - Good enough. - How's the stable boy racket? - Oh, I wouldn't know. I'm an owner now. Say, remember Gale's horse Lady Q? Sure, the shortstop. Well, she quit stoppin'. She belongs to me now. We're gonna enter her in the Brewster Handicap and walk away with it. Well, great stuff. Who's we? Me and my old man. Why, I didn't know you had a father. Oh, say, you ever run into that fellow again you know, the one I talked to at the other track? - Well, that's... - I remembered who he was. I looked him up in the wanted file at headquarters. - It was Doc Terry, alright. - What? Yeah, that's his name, Thomas Terry. He used to be a vet. He owes the state about eight years. Say, you haven't bumped into him maybe? No. What's he wanted for? Remember the horse called Grandcheek? Sure. One of the finest horses the track has ever known. Well, booze had got Terry and he fell into the hands of a bunch of grifters who wanted Grandcheek to lose. 'So they got Terry to do the old spun jack.' Oh, well, well, booze will make a guy do a lot of funny things. Well, this wasn't funny. The horse dropped dead in the middle of the race, the jock riding him 'died in the hospital a week later.' 'We nabbed Terry, alright.' Well, then he served his term? No, he skipped bail. To think I had him right in my hands 'and let him get away.' Well, I-I gotta be going. Well, see you opening day. Maybe not, Barney. Maybe her hoof ain't right yet. Maybe it's too soon after the operation. Operation on her hoof? - Who did it? - Oh, vet. A young fellow I found, uh... Terry did a marvelous operation on a horse once. Also cured him of stopping. Oh, this was nothing like the Skeeball oper.. I didn't mention the horse's name. How do you know about it? I-I, I read about it. I thought you told me you didn't have any folks. Where'd you find your father? I bumped into him like. Haven't seen each other for years, have you? Not since I was a baby. Then how'd you recognize each other? By the strawberry mark on your left shoulders? Oh, why don't you take your hands off my shoulder? What's all the question about? Why are you lying to me, Mickey? I ain't lying to you. I know you love horses. You won't deliberately shield a man who killed one, would you? Quit puttin' the needles on me. I don't know anything. Why don't you do your own gumshoeing? I don't know anything, I tell ya! I, I.. # When you wore a tulip a sweet yellow tulip # # And I wore a big red rose # # When you caressed me 'twas then heaven blessed me # # What a blessing no one knows # # You made life cheery when you called me dearie # # 'Twas down where the blue grass grows # # Your lips were sweeter than julep # # When you wore that tulip # # And I wore a big # # Red rose ## 'That was excellent!' 'Yes, indeed, excellent.' 'But in the next number, tenors' 'just a little more moderato, please.' And, uh, contraltos, just a teensy-weensy 'bit more andantino' 'expressivo and allegro.' And now turn to page 43. "That's How I Need You." # Like the roses need their fragrance # # Like a sweetheart needs a kiss # # Like the summer needs the sunshine # # Like a laddie needs a miss # # Like a broken heart needs gladness # # Like the flowers need the dew # # Like a baby # # Needs its mother # # That's how I # # Need you ## We have to shorten it tonight, folks? It's gettin' late. There's work to do tomorrow. I'll go and get the ice cream ready. You pass the plates. - Oh, it's early, isn't it? - Yes, it's only half past 9:00. 'Why are we breakin' up so early?' 'I thought we'd be here for another hour..' Uh, the.. Oh, uh, folks, uh, I almost forgot. I hate to speak about it, but, uh, Mrs. Flanders asked me to take up a collection at this time. Collection? What for? Uh, to, well, to fix the church steeple. Why? What's the matter with it? Well, it ain't high enough. I'll, I'll start off myself with, uh, with this. Thank you. There's mine. Thank you. Nothing like a cheerful give.. Thank you. Nothing like a cheerful giver. Thank you, thank... 'Well, all ready for the ice cream?' Uh, your plate. - Thank you. - Your plate, here. You take these plates. Give me that one. Gee, Lady, if pop goes near that track they'll nab him for sure. I gotta keep him away from Burlington. How am I gonna do that? He's all set on goin'. If I tell him that I know all about what, what he'd done.. If he'd wanted me to know, he'd have told me. Maybe he's ashamed of me knowing. I gotta keep him away from Burlington. I got to. - It's been a beautiful sing. - 'Everybody was in good voice.' - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - We had a nice time. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - You wait. I wanna talk to you. That suit fits you real good. Well, thanks. I'll, I'll go right off to the barn change it and bring it back. You can have that. There are plenty more of Mr. Flanders' clothes upstairs. Um, thanks. They'll come in handy up at the track. I've been thinkin' things over. I don't think you ought to leave here. Well, you see, I-I gotta go. You know, we're going to race that Lady Q you know, like I told you. Well, strikes me that's a terrible life for people to live. You'll be much better off around here. Farm's gettin' rundown. I'd like someone to work on it. Well, yeah, I'd like to, but you see there ain't, uh, enough money for what me and the kid we've got to do. See, we've got... Well, there's plenty of money for someone owning half of this place. I'd-I'd.. Uh, what did.. I don't get ya. State law is husband and wife share all property. Uh, but.. You mean that, uh.. You mean that you're asking me to marry you? You don't think I'm suggesting anythin' else, do you? Well, this is so sudden. It's a.. It's awfully sudden. Do you mind if I go over at the barn and think it over? Think it over? Fiddlesticks. None of the others had to think it over. I don't see why you should. Now let me see. A house weddin' would cost money. Justice of peace will be just as bindin'. Tomorrow afternoon after you finish the milking. Goodnight, Thomas. - What's the matter, pop? - Come on. Get your toothbrush. And everything you've got. We're scramming out of here. - What? Is somethin' wrong? - Yeah, everything's wrong. Remember me telling you I had a way with women? - Yeah. - Well, it's gotten out of hand. That widow's going to marry me tomorrow whether I like it or not. Come on, let's get going. Oh, wait a minute. Now don't do anything hasty, pop. - That sounds pretty good. - Yeah? Well, who's she marryin', you or me? You think I wanna settle down in this hole with a five-time loser? It ain't safe. That's just what it is, pop. It's safe. Well, we like the country, don't we? It's beautiful, ain't it? Well, I'll be awful happy here. What's the matter with you? What about racing Lady Q and getting the dough for your schooling? Well, we don't have to race her. We don't need the dough, you could teach me. I, I bet you know more than all the vet schools put together. Two things I ain't. A teacher and a husband. Come on, get everything together. We're gettin' out. We can make Burlington by morning. Pop, we ain't going to Burlington. I've been thinking it over and, well, I don't wanna race Lady Q. - I don't think she's ready yet. - Oh, certainly, she's ready. You're tryin' to be a vet before you even go to school? I don't ever want to be a vet. I don't want none of that. Look, if you don't wanna stick around here, it's okay with me. We'll go someplace else, around a farm. 'I like farmin'.' Say, while I'm your old man, we'll do as I say. We'll do anything you say, pop except we ain't going to Burlington. - Why not? - Because.. Well, you're, you're liable to start drinkin' again. Why, I ain't had a drink in months. Well, that's because it's hard to get around here. There's a lot of booze around the track and, pop, I'll come clean... Say, that's a pretty insultin' crack. You're gettin' disrespectful again. Oh, I'm a drunkard, huh? That's a nice way of you to talk about your old man. That, that ain't gonna work out either. - What ain't? - Father and son business. I, I've been thinkin' that over too. Say, listen. Have you gone out of your head? Well, I've decided that you and me, we're a lot different. - What? - We don't belong together. You said at the beach, we'd try it. Well, we tried and I don't think it's worked out. - Ain't worked out? - No, it ain't. - That's how I feel about it. - We adopted each other. We said till death do us part. Well, I'm unadopting us right here and now. You ain't got no claim on me. It wasn't legal. - That lickin' I promised. - Oh, go on and lick me. That won't change nothing, but we ain't going to Burlington. You shut your mouth and go where I go and that's to Burlington. Oh, no, no, you ain't goin' to Burlington. - We're quits. - We're not quits. - Yes, we are. - We're not quits. You get back, we're going right away. No, we ain't. Don't you understand? - We're not going! - You're going with me! No, no, no! - There you are. - Thank you. That's Faraday in the third tomorrow and Plunge Ahead in the fifth. - 'Hello, Mr. Merlin.' - Why, hi, Steward. - When did you get in? - Yesterday. - How's your stock? - Great. Looks like we're gonna have a great meet. - See you tomorrow. - Okay. What is it, young man? Say, is there any chance of a fellow gettin' any credit around here? - Credit? - Wh-why not? Suppose a fellow had a great horse. Uh, it should be in a handicap but he didn't have enough money for entrance fee. Why not let him run her and then you guys could take the money out of her winnings? But there's always a small possibility of the animal losing, you know? Oh, there's ain't no chance of this horse ever losing. Well, hello, Mrs. Shepherd. - How are you? - Hello, Pete. - Good morning, Mrs. Shepherd. - How are you? - Nice to see you. - Very happy to see you again. - Thank you. - What can we do for you? Well, let me have your condition book and point out the soft spots on it, so my horses can pick up a lot of worthwhile stakes. I'm a poor woman this year. What? After all the money Miracle Lad has made for you? When do we see Miracle Lad? We're going to work him in a little while. John, there is the finest piece of horse pace you've ever seen. I'll race my horse against him anytime, any place. Here, here, young man. Go on, run along, we're busy. No, no, no, wait, Steward. Are you an owner? Yes, ma'am. My horse is as good as any on the track. Bring on your Miracle Lad, we'll show him. Well, we might do that sometime, but not right now. He's just been shipped down from the farm and has had a long, tiring journey. I had to walk Lady Q 23 miles last night to get here. Hm, I guess that just about makes us even. Suppose you give her a rest, then soon we'll, we'll have a private race all our own. Yes, and in the meantime, young man you better get back to her. She probably misses you by now. Hyah! Hey, you, what's the idea? Go on! Let that hothouse flower out. Come on, honey, argh! Get out of here, you mug, this is Miracle Lad. This is Lady Q! Come on, honey, he'll remember us the next time! I thought we have the track exclusively for this time? You have. I'll see about this. Looks as though Miracle Lad has competition this morning. Ha! Is that the best he can do? Come on, Miracle Lad. Come on, whoever you are. Ha! Come on, honey. Ha! Headin' for home, baby. Ha! Go get 'em, girl. Guess there's nothin' wrong with that hoof now, huh? Hah! That look like a photograph finish, Pete. Attagirl. Gee, Lady. Gee, Lady. That's it, girl. Oh, that's.. Young man, get down off that horse. - Oh, it's you. - Yes, ma'am. Where'd you get that beetle? You wanna sell her? There ain't enough money to buy her, sir. - So this is the horse, eh? - Yes, ma'am. I thought we better have that little race right away. I hope he ain't sore. Not after a performance like that. Then would you do somethin' for me? Will you race her under your colors? I ain't got the fee. There's a guy I owe a lot of dough to for an operation. I got a feelin' he'll be needin' the dough pretty badly. I'll enter her on one condition. What's that? That none of my horses have to run against her. Well, the Brewster Handicap tomorrow will put her right in the right spot. Alright, then that's the race we'll give her. I gotta ride her though, ma'am. Alright, put her in our barn, Pete. - Okay, stall 12, barn 3. - Gee... Gee, thanks a lot, ma'am. Oh, um, oh, Steward. There was something I want to speak to you about. See, baby. Gee, that's what you ought to have on. - Gosh. - Hello there, Mickey. Thought you weren't gonna run her. Well, I put it up to her and she started cryin' and carryin' on something awful so I thought I ought to bring her up here so she could at least watch the races. You'll find her in the press box. Oh, now, there's no use being sore just 'cause we had a little misunderstanding. - How's your father? - Oh, didn't you hear? That guy wasn't my pa at all. Ended up he was a third cousin or somethin' on my grandmother's side through a through a marriage of an aunt. - We finally had to shoot him. - Sounds only fair enough. I'm still your friend, kid. Sorry, Barney, but we got nothin' to be friendly about anymore. We don't like the same things. Oh, honey, this is our lucky day. Look, Lady. Betty War. One of Man o' War's babies. Specify. Winner of the Hollywood Derby. This beauty here, that's Gypsy Minstrel. Beat Stagehand once at Santa Anita. Here's Dobber. He'd come second in the Kentucky Derby. Won the Preakness too. Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. Uh, don't look now. I think this is Seabiscuit. Yes, sir, that's Seabiscuit. Oh, honey, we sure are in vast company but that's where you belong. Here we are. They couldn't have done better for you at The Ritz. After you, Your Majesty. Here's your ridin' silk, sir. Miss Shepherd said try 'em on and see if they fit. - Thank you. - Good luck this afternoon, sir. Thank you very much. Gee. Do you ever see silks with so many colors in 'em? Hey, I'm gonna look like a rainbow with pants on, huh? Hey, how'd you like your boyfriend? Pretty neat, huh? Yes, siree. Looks like they were made to order for me. Yes, sir. But you know what I always say. If a guy's got a good figure, he can wear anything, huh? That's right, ain't it, sweetheart? Ain't we gonna make a swell-lookin' couple when we get into that winnin'.. 'What's the matter, honey?' Gee.. Don't, don't tell me this is bothering you again. Oh, I-I can't see anything. Dressed kind of early, ain't you? What's it to you? Come on, easy, honey. Easy. Easy, girl. Does it hurt you much, Lady? Yes, well.. ...y-you can't run with that. No. Well, what are we gonna do? I-if you can't run, what's pop gonna do? 'Well, Mickey.' What's the trouble, lad? She's, she's lame. - 'What is it, Pete?' - Well, I can't tell, ma'am. It might be anything. Well, I'm sorry, young fellow, but if she can't run I better go over to Steward's and take her out of the race. I, I guess so. Oh, I'm terribly sorry, laddie, but don't take it so hard. We'll have her fixed up and run her some other time. - The meet's just begun. - She should be runnin' today. Some other time, it'd be too late. Today's when she should be runnin'. 'She'll run today.' Her hoof's a little bit tender. I brought along a bar shoe. That'll protect it. With that on, why, she'll run over anything on the track. Well, who are you, please? Well, I used to take care of her for him. Oh, well, then if you're sure she's going to be alright, I better stop Pete. Ah, she'll be alright, lady. She'll be alright. You see, your worries are all over. Yes, ma'am. Get out of here. I'll go just as soon as I fix her up. Never mind her. Get out right now. Not until I'm through. I take an interest in my patients. She'll run... I don't care if she runs or not. Go on. Get out right now... Listen, if you're worried about me cuttin' in on your winnings why, just forget it, because when I'm through I won't bother either of you anymore. Who cares about her winnings? Go on, beat it. Scram before that cop nabs you, will ya? What are you talking about? That Detective Donovan, he told me all about you when I went there to get the entry blank. Why, he's probably watching me now, so he can nab you. - Donovan told you? - Yeah. Gee, then-then that's why you didn't want me to come. That's why you slapped me, ain't it? Oh, what other reason would I have? I had to keep you away from here. Gee, I'd rather cut off my right arm, pop, than... Gee-whiz, I thought that you was through with me. After Lady Q wins the race, we can probably go away... I didn't think that you wanted me hanging around anymore... Will you listen to me, pop? We can get a little joint. You and I can stick together. Nobody will ever find you. I was wondering and wondering what I'd done to make you... This ain't no time to talk now, pop. You go back to the widow's. You stall around. I'll meet you there in a couple of days. - You can let your beard grow. - Oh, I can't. You get goin' now. Stay off the main highways, huh? - Have you got a handkerchief? - Yeah. Well, keep it up to your face like you're blowing your nose. - Huh? Nobody can see your face. - No. Gee, son, I'd, I'd like to stay and watch you win that race. Pop, ain't you got no sense? Donovan's here at the track. Yeah, but I could stand somewhere where... If you don't get going, pop, I'm not even gonna run. Okay, okay. I'm gone, I'm gone. Now, listen, her hoof is alright. - Run her. - Okay. So long, pop. See you in a couple of days. - So long. Good luck to you. - Handkerchief! Handkerchief! Well, come on, boy. You better get going. Yes, sir. - Well, let's get up. - Yes, sir. And good luck, Mickey. 'The horses are on the track and parading to the post.' 'The horses are nearing the starting gate.' Pop, go away. Come on, 9, wake up. 'They're at the post.' 'And there they go! Lady Q got a bad start.' Come on, you lads! Get out of the.. '...is taking the lead by a length.' That's too bad. Please keep goin', Lady, please. You can do it. Come on, Lady Q. Come on, don't let that kid down. Come on, get up in there. Go on, Lady, get up in there. That's my boy, that's.. Hello, doc. Why, hello. Do you mind waiting till the race is over? Okay. I'd like to watch the race myself. Swell. 'At the far turn, Luke Arthur' 'is still lead by Spalding.' 'Bondi is second.' Go on, make your move now. Come on. We can't let pop down, Lady. Let's go! Now she's making her move. Get up in there. Come on, get in there. 'And here's comes Lady Q in the middle of the pack.' You're makin' it, honey. Keep goin'! Keep goin', baby! Lady! Look at her come. Look at her come. Look at her come. Don't go through that. Don't.. Look out! Look out! - I'm comin' through! - No, you don't! I'm going through, I tell you! Careful. - 'And there Lady Q cuts..' - He's through! Ha! Ha! Come on, get in there! Come on, Lady! 'Behind there is Lady Q..' - 'They're all in the finish..' - Come on, Mickey! 'Lady Q is past the leader.' 'Now it's Luke Arthur and Lady Q.' 'They're head-in-head and so close.' - Here we go. Don't stop yet. - Come on. 'Luke Arthur and Lady Q..' - Come on! Lady, come on. - Come on! Stay with the boy! 'Lady Q is soaring away and it's the wire.' 'It's Lady Q, the winner by a neck.' - What a ride! - Lady, she was.. Oh, gosh. Let's get out of here before the kid gets over here. Oh! You ran a swell race, baby. I bet pop is sure proud of you. Hey, wait a minute, young man. You have a wreath coming to you. And these fellas are taking pictures for the newspaper. Alright, Steward, but I gotta get goin'. - I got a date. - Hold it there. Say, Steward, when can I pick up the purse? Mrs. Shepherd is probably picking it up right now. Gee, thanks a lot. That was a great ride, young man. Oh, she's a great horse. Cool her out, Danny. Yes, sir, I sure will. Won my pork chops on you, Lady Q. Say there, I'll take her. Say, boy, that was a sweet race. Thanks a lot. It's a sweet horse. Come on, honey. We did it, honey. We did it. Thirty five hundred bucks. We're gonna have to get pop to count it. I count up to a hundred and then I get stuck. I'm ignorant. Now we're gonna go over to the widow's and pick up pop and then we're gonna go get ourselves a little hideout someplace and I'm gonna get some books and pop can help me 'and I'm gonna study and you..' 'Well, let's see what can you do?' 'You can just lay around and eat.' 'You lazy old, good-for-nothin' thing you.' 'Ain't everything marvelous?' Oh, boy, oh, boy, ain't everything marvelous, honey? Congratulations, Mickey. Thanks, Barney. Say, why don't you quit snooping around? You're only wasting your time. Well, you don't mind a fellow comin' around to tell you what a good ride you made and wish you well, do you? Almost as a social call. Oh, well, that's different. I thought maybe you were lookin' for my old man because if that was the case then you're just wasting your time. I ain't got him. Honest I ain't, Barney. Look, you can search me. Go ahead, look, see. Hey, hey, pop, you down there? Nope, he ain't there. Not up my sleeves, you see. And Lady Q, she ain't got him either. Go ahead, Barney, you can frisk her yourself. - I believe you. - Well, then you'll excuse me. I got a lot of work to do, Barney. If I see my old man, I'll tell him you're lookin' for him. Uh, he might even look you up. - You care for him, don't you? - What do you think? He must care a lot for you, too to take a chance comin' up here to see you. He cares alright for.. How did you know he was here? How did you know that? Here, you rich man, you bloated plutocrat, your purse. I'm asking you somethin', Barney. Mickey dear. Mickey, here's your money. Why, you've enough there to put you through a good vet school. Vet school? How did you know I want to go to vet school? Oh, well. You see, you can't keep a secret from a woman, Mickey. Listen, dear, there's no necessity for you to leave here. Oh, there's a lovely spot for Lady... How'd you know I was gonna leave? Uh, what are you starin' at me like that for? Somethin' you wanna tell me, isn't it? - Well, why don't you tell me? - Listen, Mickey, you must be... Why, wh-what is it? I don't get it. She had.. Why, why don't you just spit it out? It's my pop, ain't it? You've got him, haven't you? Haven't you? - Why, you dirty, sneakin'... - Now, now, now, sonny. - No, no, no. - Pop. Pop. See where they got you, pop. That's alright, that.. Suppose they have. What of it? We'll-we'll beat up on him. We'll lay him out of here. No, we won't. No, we won't. No. Remember I, I said you deserved a lickin' once. Well, I'd done something and I deserve a lickin' too. So I'm just takin' what's comin' to me. Oh, you took your lickin' all those years ever since it happened. Well, there's a little bit more comin' to me. It won't last long, a couple of years and then it will be all over and there won't be nothin' hangin' over our heads then. Oh, if you're goin' away, I'm goin' with you. Now, now, stop that foolish talk. You ain't invited. I'll get myself invited. I'll do somethin'. I'll steal, so they have to send me up there. No, you can't leave me behind, pop. No, no, no, no, no. Now stop that. You're just making it tougher on the both of us. Now keep your chin up. Ain't you proud to have me as your old man? - What else have I got? - Well, then keep your chin up. So I'll know that you're proud of me. And wipe those kid tears out of your eyes. Come on, get a grin on your face and when you say goodbye to me, why, smile. Before you have a chance to wipe that smile off I'll be right back again. Pop, I, I can't do it. Yes, you can. Sure, you can. Here, look at here, come on. Get a smile on your face. Come on. Come on. That's right. I guess it'd be kind of, kind of sissy for two great big men like us to kiss, huh? Well, goodbye, sonny. Pop. Pop! Pop! Pop, I, it wouldn't be sissy on the cheek. You'll work for him, Mickey. A few months, perhaps a year at the most. Gee, that ain't such a long time for a guy to go without washing his face, is it?
