Princess Berry, where are you? Princess Berry is late. Where could she be? I'm here, I'm sorry. There you are. I'm sorry I'm late, my queen. It was the donkey's fault. It's best not to blame others for your own misfortunes. But this time it really was the donkey's fault. He fell down flat on his belly! On his belly? Yes, flat on his belly down by the stream. 42nd floor. And how was the dream different this time? This time, everything goes dark and I'm there alone in the water, desperately trying to climb out, but I can't. This time, I feel like something is pulling me down. Hm. Can you describe what it is that's pulling you down? I don't know. Frankie king, Blaze talent, reading for the role of surprised woman. Maybe my job, my relationship. And what's the status there? Dax moved out so it's over. All right, we got it. Let's rap on Frankie. We're not good for each other. This is a big step. Yeah. So how does it feel to close that chapter? I don't know. I still have a lot of open chapters in my life. Go inside and wash up for dinner. Oh, I surely don't deserve dinner. I was late and I'm terribly upset with myself. Accidents happen. Now, run along and let me have a few words with this donkey. Thank you, my queen. And what do you have to say for yourself? And this is where the donkey starts talking. Okay, cut. Back to one. So, I think we're slipping a bit too far into caricature. But she is a caricature, Marcus. Yeah, but we need her more tender, a bit more real, a bit more grandmotherly. Okay, more grandmotherly. And just a bit more. You got it. - Okay, great. - Okay. Hey Grayson, it's Frankie. I got your message. I don't really know what to say. Call me back. I'm so sorry, that's terrible news. I hadn't spoken to them in years. Well, still. How long do you need? I don't know, a week, a couple days. I lost my father three years ago. Couldn't sleep, got addicted to ativan. We only have the donkey booked until Friday so that's gonna be a bit of an issue. Jesus, Marcus. We can get, we can get another donkey. But this is a really great donkey. No, can you give us some space? Look, I'll see what I can swing. Take the rest of the week. I may not even need to go, we weren't very close. Frankie, you have to go. I'll see what I can do. Take the week. I'm scared... To go back. But I feel like I have to. And what's the fear? What's scary about this? Judgment. Who are you picturing now? Everyone. My brother. Are you in touch with him? Grayson? Not really. He's a... Difficult person. I think he resents me for leaving the family. And how do you feel about it, your decision to leave? I did what I thought I needed at the time. I'm happy to inform you you're eligible for an upgrade. No extra cost. An upgrade? Correct, you reserved an economy vehicle. It looks like I can upgrade you to a full-size vehicle, four doors, a lot more room. It's just me. Well, treat yourself. Okay. Excellent. So, what brings you to this area, work or pleasure? It's work, hard work. And will you be wanting our collision coverage today? Yeah, please. Great. Throughout the whole thing, not one. I think that's that girl. Oh, don't talk. Turn around. I don't want to look. Turn around. Isn't she the one that was on that show? Excuse me? I don't mean to be a bother. No. Are you the one that's in the chocolate bar commercial? Yeah. It's her! For heaven's sake, we knew we had seen yous. I told you, Betty. Can we get a picture? Get in there, Betty! Do you mind? - Hey. - Grayson. Were you gonna tell me you're in town or you're just gonna wait for me to find ya roaming the streets? I'm sorry, I was gonna call you this morning. Come on, get in, let's grab breakfast. Yeah, okay. Don't we see you on TV all the time, that show? Yeah. That little shithead loves it. I guess that's kids nowadays. That's all they want is screens and screens. What is he, three now? No, he's four. Wow. Mm-hm. When we try and tell him that that's his auntie Frankie up there, He just looks at us like we're morons. Well, that's auntie Frankie! Auntie Frankie king. That's a heck of a name you picked there. Is that real, Frankie king? Does it say that on your driver's license or? It's a stage name. A stage name. Yeah, my agent thought it would... Would you excuse me for a moment? Fill your boots. So how long you in town for? I don't know. How long should I be in town for? I don't really care, I guess. I'm sorry if that's... No, it's fine. It's just you haven't really been a part of things for a while here, Frankie. You can't just waltz in and expect to run the show, you know? I don't expect to run the show. You married? Got a boyfriend or? No. Sucks. You know, just 'cause your eggs aren't gettin' any younger. I actually just read a study, you know, it's actually not safe for women your age 'cause the kids they come out all retarded or, you know, it's just a roll of the dice. I got a salad for you. Burger and fries for you. Can I get you folks anything else? No, Janice, we're perfect, thank you. Okay, great, enjoy that. What makes you think I even want kids? Hm? Nevermind. So they, um. They got the autopsy report back. I guess dad just had a heart attack behind the wheel. Yeah. Just like that. The car rolls like seven times so he just takes mom with him. Anyhow. Got a meeting with the lawyer later on so. You can come, I guess. It's up to you. Grayson Bingley. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I'll be right there. Okay. Hey, I gotta pop by work for a minute, you mind? Fill your boots. - Hey. - Hey. - How's it goin'? - All right. This is my sister, Frankie. Frankie, this is my boss, Rhonda. Hi, I didn't know you had a sister. Yeah, well, voila. So what's up with that pipe? There was a break in the line, I'll show you. All right. Just give me a bit, I'll find you. Sure. - Thanks for coming. - Yeah. All right, I know that none of this is easy so I'll try and make this as painless as possible, okay? All right, so the last amendment to this document was in 2015 when Grayson's son was born. Grayson, you've been appointed executor of the estate. Okay. What does that mean? Well, basically it's a responsibility to fulfill the will, close the estate, all of its assets, tax stuff. There's a list. What about the house or what's inside the house like jewelry or China or, I don't know. It's up to you. Keep it, sell it, whatever. Okay. And what if I get hit by a bus tomorrow? Then it goes down the line to your spouse, your child. - Okay. - Okay? All right, so I am going to paraphrase here. We give, devise and bequeath our estate and all of its related assets, all tangible personal property, money, real estate to Grayson Bingley. Please see appendix five. Appendix five states that $25,000 from the estate is to be donated to the bankview united church. Oh, that makes sense. I mean, our family is a pretty big part of the church so. I also have a small rsp and $12,000 in a checking account. I also have two life insurance policies with Grayson named beneficiary on those. What about Frankie? I'm sorry, Frankie. Makes sense. Okay, I'm gonna need some signatures to get the ball rolling. Yeah. Sure. I'm gonna wait outside. Hi, can I just get a black coffee please? Frankie? Hi. It's Bruce. Yeah, I know, of course. Hi. I didn't know if you recognized me. No, you look the same. Liar. Well, I recognized you so. I assume you're in town 'cause of your folks. Yeah, you heard it? Yeah, I'm so sorry. It's a real tragedy. Thanks. So where you livin' now? I move back and forth between la and Vancouver so I'm kind of all over the place. Yeah, I heard you're doing the acting thing. Yeah. Some folks were saying they saw you on TV. Yeah, I'm in a few shoes. I don't actually own a TV so I wouldn't have seen ya. So what are you doing these days? Still got the family farm. Teaching at b high. You're teaching? Yeah, yeah, it's just mechanics. That's great. Yeah, well, it was great running into ya, Frankie. Yeah, nice to see you. Yeah, really nice. All right, well, condolences again. And I'll see you around. See you around. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Listen, just 'cause you're not in the will. I'm not actually here for the money, Grayson. You want a lift back? No, I'm gonna walk around for a bit. All right. Hey. I have an appointment tomorrow with the funeral stuff. If you wanna come to that. Yeah, okay. All right. At 10am. See ya then. I'm not quite sure how to be out here, ya know? How to smile back at people who smile at you on the street. And you don't get this feeling at home? No, not really, it's suffocating here. Why do you think that is? I don't know, maybe because I thought I'd never come back. But you did. Yeah. Sheila? Sheila? Right. Wha? I don't really know how it all shakes down but apparently I'm in charge of the estate so. You're executor. That's it. How are you doing? Are you getting enough help? Yeah, yeah. My sister showed up so. I don't know how much help - she's gonna be. - Your sister? Yeah, she's back. She might come for your share so watch out. Ah, speak of the devil. Oh, not literally. Ah, depends on who you're asking. Frankie, this is pastor Neil. Frankie, it is such a pleasure to finally meet you. And my condolences. Thank you. The pastor is gonna be conducting the service for mom and dad at his church. Your folks were such a big part of this community and the church. Don't I know it. Well, hopefully you won't turn to dust when you walk through the church doors. I just might. I doubt she'll turn to dust. I'm not very religious. She's an atheist actually. Or what, you an anarchist, what are you calling yourself nowadays? Right, thank you, Grayson. And why am I here exactly? Okay, I have to go, but please do take a look at those passages that I sent you. If there are any changes and if you want to say something. Okay? I'll see you both at the service then. Thank you. I knew your parents quite well. We spent quite a bit of time together before my wife passed. Which one of these did you put your wife in? Cherry wood, it's the best. Mom didn't want to be buried. I always remember her saying that. She didn't like the bugs. Cremation is also a lovely option. $11,000, for this? It's cherry. You know, I can build one of them and Bury 'em out back the house for next to nothing. Well, that would be illegal, Mr. Bingley. This is robbery, sir. Sorry you feel that way. This is my livelihood, no different than you growing your stuff. I disagree. You gotta die, there's no choice there. I run a respectable family business much like your parents did, Mr. Bingley. None of us dipped our toes in the black market. We'll burn 'em. Burn 'em up. All right. The cremation fee is $2400 per body. You got a two-for-one on that? Um, no. Do you wanna maybe come over for dinner tonight? To see marn? Meet the little guy. That would be nice. Thank you. Frankie, how ya doin'? Oh, you know, I'm stuck deep inside the asshole of the country. I'm swell, hun. So, look, I tried my best but we kinda need you back on Saturday to shoot the donkey out. I'm sorry, Frankie. Frankie? That's two days from now, Kim. The funeral's on Sunday. Yeah. Well, I guess it's Sophie's choice then, hun. I wish I had better news. It's not a Sophie's choice, my fucking parents died. I know. I know, Frankie. I'm just the messenger here. I tried to get the network to consider... Can't they push to Monday? My hands are tied. I'm sorry. So what if I don't show? What, are they gonna kill her off? Maybe, I don't know. Look, I'm sorry, Frankie. The same thing happened to me when I was with... Yeah. Fuck, fuck! Hey ya, bud. What are you selling? Lemonade. Did you make it? All by myself. May I have a glass? - Sure. - How much is it? For about $2. Does this work? Yeah. And you got, so don't keep the money? No, no, that money's for you now. Is it good? Mm-hmm. Thanks, bud. I see you met the little man. Yeah, he's quite the entrepreneur. Oh yeah. Oh, buddy, I ought to be taking financial advice from you, eh? Did you meet, do you know who this is? Auntie Frankie, she has crazy hair, I don't like it! You don't like it. It's growing on me. You wanna go on inside to see marnie? - Yeah. - Yeah. All right, buddy, close up shop. Okay, close, everyone! Thanks, glad I caught you. Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah! Hey. You remember Frankie? Frankie, holy shit! It's been forever. Sorry, hands. Oh, it's nice to see you again. Yeah, it's been ages. Yeah. We oughta have some more people die around here so you can come more often. Oh, come on, marn. I brought some wine. I don't know what you guys like so. I don't really drink so. Well, I sure as heck do. Crank it open, sister! Okay. And I'm at the end of my rope. We're sitting there on that runway like hour four or five and we haven't even taken off yet. And I'm thinking to myself like drive the fuckin' plane, will ya, please, Mr. Driver, sir, you know? All right. No, no, no, I know, it's a chore. Yeah, it's always a pain in the ass. Something always goes wrong, always. Yeah, that's why we don't travel. The burgers were great, thank you. Well, thank you, Frankie. And I don't usually eat red meat so. What do you, a vegan? No, I'm obviously eating meat. I don't know. You never know what the west coast can do to a person with all the pinko lefties running around with their braided arm pit hair, afraid to eat the honey from the bees, you know. No, I don't know. Okay, children, less politics, more wine. Gray, do we have any more of that stuff that Dougie made, downstairs? No, I don't think so. Frankie, you want another glass, right? - Uh, actually. - Yeah, you want another one, okay. She's great. Yeah, yeah, she can really get going. So what are you gonna do with the farm? I don't know, I might sell it. Could use the capital, get some skin in the game for that new facility going up, you know. You should do that. Yeah. So you gonna tell me the real reason that you came back or what? I don't know, to see you. Just seems odd, I haven't seen you in years. We never talk. We don't have a relationship. No, I know how it seems. It seems odd. So you're still doing the acting thing, eh? Yeah, I'm chipping away at it. That is so cool. Hey, you should talk to my niece. She's been doin' a lotta like short films and stuff back out east with acting, you know. Really wants to make it big. Yeah, sure. You tell her all the tricks of the trade, you know? Like shortcuts. Yeah, right, shortcuts. I wish we'd seen more of ya. I like this, ya know. Yeah. It's great. Marn, hun! This kid's bein' a dick. Okay, I'm comin'. These men, I tell ya. Be right back. So I went to the house last night. Oh? Yeah, I wanted to see if I could... You know, if I did remember the way it was. And? There's a lot of shit in there. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not looking forward to dealing with that. Hey, do you remember anyone with the name Bennett, last name Bennett? Doesn't ring a bell, why? I just, I was, I thought I remembered someone, my mom and dad's friends. I doubt it. I know all of mom and dad's friends. You sure about that? Yeah, I am. Since when do you not drink? Since the kid was born. Yeah. Yeah, it's good, I guess. It was just startin' to get in the way of things. It sure did for dad. What is that supposed to mean? I'm just saying, dad didn't make the greatest decisions when he was drinking. Why are you doin' this? What, what? You just come back to shit on him or? 'Cause you were a screw up. No, I was just... Just being disrespectful because that's nothin' new. Excuse me? You just think you're so much better than everyone, Frankie. I don't think I'm fucking better than anyone, Grayson. Frankie knows best. Okay, I'm gonna go. That's a good idea. The best idea you've had in a decade. Hey, fuck you! Yeah, run away, Frankie. That's classic stuff. ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ All right, you guys have to really do it there.

It wasn't hard, he's a terrible liar. Yeah, I guess. Your whole marriage is a lie. You think he actually loves you? He doesn't love you. He's planning on leaving you, Terry. It's over. Believe what you want. You think he's playing soccer every Thursday night? No. He's making love to me every Thursday. That's icky, okay, cut. Okay, I think we got it. That's it? Yeah, it's easy, right? You don't wanna do another one? Do you think I should do another one? Well, I mean, there was a bump in the middle. I feel like I can do it a bit better. You think you can do a little better? Yeah, if we can. Okay, you got it. All right. From the top. Remember friends, I want you to hang around. Coming up in the second half, the toughest eight seconds on earth right here in bankview. We're glad you're with us on this, another fabulous rodeo weekend right here in bankview. I never woulda thought in a million years I'd end up at a rodeo in bankview with my high school boyfriend. Never? No never, ever, ever. It fucking reeks in here like animal shit. Well, I don't smell a thing, city girl. So you never got married? No, I got close a couple times but just didn't feel right. I take it neither did you? Well, I am actually. Oh. Yeah, I've been meaning to tell you. Ah ha, fuckin' actor. No, I don't think it's in the cards for me. Well, bayview, another great rodeo ride. Now it's time to go to shoot number four as we get ready for one of the top bronc riders we have in our game. He's gonna measure that bronc rein all the way back to the front of the saddle. After that, we're gonna come out. He nods his head and away we go! How about that, bankview? Another great saddle bronc ride. As we call in the pick up men to rein in that beautiful palomino pony, another one of the four-legged superstars from our game. This should be a bunch of fun as we get ready to ride another one. I work with a donkey on the kid's show. It's got nothin' on these. This is fun. Thank god. Okay, don't get me wrong. This is a really country experience, but it's kinda fun. Well, you're country, Frankie. Down those guts. So, I, uh. I think I just find out that I have a sister. Oh? Yeah, I don't know. Whoa, how's that? My dad. It was a secret he didn't tell anybody. I don't know, part of me's interested in this girl, you know? Wow. You share blood, that's the thing. It's undeniable. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Here we go. Thank you, that was more fun than I thought it would be. Well, that's a great review. You know I didn't mean it like that. I know. Hey, um. I'm sorry about the way that things ended between us. You got nothing to be sorry about, Frankie. Are you coming to the funeral? I'll be there. Hey, did that make you dick bigger? I'm speeding, you fucking asshole! Hey, penny. Frankie, how are you doing? I'm okay, getting by. Thanks for sending that self tape for the soap. The script was fucking terrible. Yeah. Hey, look, I have the Berry producers on my ass. Yeah, I talked to Kim. They're being unreasonable. I'm trying to tell them both her parents fucking died. That's why you have production insurance, hello. Yeah, that'd be nice. Well. I negotiated and got you until Monday. I don't think I give a fuck, penny. Frankie. I don't wanna go back to that shitty set. We can talk about this more when you get back on Monday, 'Kay? Monday?

I'm Frankie Bingley, iain's daughter. Yeah, uh. I'm not sure who you're talking about. - I'm sorry. - He's dead. Can we talk? I'm not quite sure why you're here, Frankie. I have a half-sister. Yeah. How'd you find me? I found the money orders. Well, I was young and I made a mistake so. I am not here to judge you. No? What are you doing here then? Okay, you know what, I can't do this. I'm sorry, I never shoulda come here. Wait. Wait. Do you want some coffee? We met at a convention in Montana. I was working for a wind power company. You know, these conventions. A lotta parties, a lotta drinking. And we were at the same hotel. He was really easy to talk to. And I remember when he smiled at me I, I felt like it was genuine, it was warm. I was pretty lonely at the time. My parents lived back east. Did you know he was married? We never talked about that. Anyway, he wanted to cut ties and I was pregnant. I'm sorry. No, don't be. It's not your fault. Yeah, I've spent a lot of time with a lotta shitty men in my life. What'd you tell Julia? I told her that I got drunk and I got pregnant. And that her father wanted nothing to do with her. That's sad. I mean, I have a beautiful daughter. Healthy. And we trust each other. I didn't know my parents. I wasn't into the farm or the church or the things my family were into. I liked boys and sex and music. I cut them out and they cut me out. But now. I'm really not here to fuck anything up for you or your daughter. I just wanted to let you know that Julia is named as beneficiary on a half a million dollar life insurance policy. Wha? You didn't know? Yeah, well, it's all there. Thank you, Frankie. Frankie? Hey. Hi. You're here to give us a hand or? What, you're not done yet? Yeah. In the grass or in the air. Wanna do this throw, count of three? One, two, three, whoa, nice throw! Okay, high five. Once we get to the bottom there, can I give this to you, honey? Yeah. - Oh shit! - Watch your foot. - You got it now? - What? - You got it now? - Kind of. Hey, I'm sorry about running away without saying goodbye the other night. Lady, don't even worry about it, I get it. I'm married to him. It's not him. You know I've got five siblings. - Oh my god. - Yeah. - Do y'all get along? - No. No, no, no, no. That's family though. Do you keep in touch? When we can. I mean, I've got nine nieces and nephews so. - Oh, Jesus. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. That would be insane hard work. - It is, yeah, it is. - Keeping track of them all. It is hard work. But it's good work, you know? In the end. It's just a matter of time. - I know that. - At least the kids know. Jude, honey, why don't you come and sit. Thank you, honey. Ooh, thank you. Do want a hot dog or do you just want your apple? I just want a hot dog. Hot dog? What do you want, do you want ketchup or mustard? - Start 'em young here. - Probably should get it done. When are you gonna start moving, around six? I'm just gonna chill as soon as Doug can hand me something. He's been doing everything, absolutely everything. Not the only person in this family who lies. Oh, snap. Bad joke, bad joke. Oh, well said. Too soon. This is gonna take years. Makes me wish I never owned anything. I'm goin' home right after this, and I'm throwin' out everything in my basement. Yeah, it's just gonna be someone else's problem one day. I remember buying this for dad, for father's day. I was like 11 or 12, and this was the first gift I ever bought him with my own money. We spent like half an hour in the thrift store, and this is what I picked. I don't think I ever saw dad where a tie a day in his life, but I thought he'd really like this. I thought I got a really good gift. Still in the box. Adios, dad. We are gathered here today to celebrate the lives of Anna and iain Bingley. And the unexpected loss of a loved one, a neighbor, a friend. Well, it brings us face to face with our own mortality, how fleeting life can be. And when cut short by tragedy, we are left with how to grapple with how to make sense of it all. And we may shake our fist at god or bow our heads in defeat and despair. But, brothers and sisters, as the apostle Paul wrote in the epistle of the thessalonians. We do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind who have no hope. For we believe that Jesus died and Rose again, and so we believe that god will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him. So. Anna and iain are now safely in the loving embrace of our savior. Let us bow our heads. Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. I just want to thank all of you for coming. I know that mom and dad are looking down on us and Mom's probably saying how much she likes the flowers so. And, uh. Excuse me. I think what my brother is trying to say is it means the world to us that all of you are here today, to our family. Most of you don't know me very well anymore. I follow scripts for a living, and I really wish I had one right now. But I don't. It's really nice to see all your faces. Are you good? Yeah. Oh, thank you and god bless. So, uh.
