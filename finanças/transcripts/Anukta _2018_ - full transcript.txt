In the lives of the Karavali (Coastal) people... ...their customs and traditions are deep rooted. When things happen around these people,... ...what comes out are mere perspectives,... ...and not reality. Shadows follow us only in the day. But the only thing that follows us irrespective of the boundaries,... ...is the Karma of our deeds. It is believed that Man who hates his own species,... ...and is full of selfish motives, can only be corrected... ...only by the traditions of this land, is... ...something that the people here believe even today. Drat ! Hmph ! Aye, clean up the place faster ! It's getting late ! Manja, turn off the kitchen light. Clean that table ! Namaskara, (Greetings) Sir ! - Yeah ! Bendy, close the shutter ! No matter how many times I call, you dare not to pick my call ! You'll regret this ! I've spared you for too long. Not anymore ! I'll teach you a lesson ! You better pay today, else I will not take it anymore. Damn you ! How many times are you going to call me? You don't even let me drink in peace. Move it ! Yes, sir ! What the hell's with you? - Sir, the thing is... My wife's unwell. She needs to go to the hospital immediately. Umm.. Fine ! Let's go ! That son of a rogue is avoiding my calls ! I badly need the cash. And he's making merry ! Goddamn it ! Careful with the vehicle. Are you drunk? Apologies, sir ! - Hmph ! Looks like it'll rain. Go faster ! - Sure, sir ! Why did you stop ? Huh? Argh ! Sir, a tree's blocking our way ! We can't move ahead ! What the hell man ! I won't be able to move it. What do we do ? Damn ! Sir, you can walk this way, right? Look at you trying to act smart in my own town ? You... Do you have a torch? Sir, it's late. Please be careful ! Get going, smarty pants ! *ON PHONE* Bhaskar, hear me out ! I've been telling you that I'm not in town ! I'll repay you once am back. Okay ? Don't bug me repeatedly with your calls. Get it? - I'm tired of this. I've never asked you all these years. But, I need the cash now ! So only, I'm asking. You've had your chance. Now that you don't need me, you're not picking my calls. I will not spare you ! Hello ?! The network's acting cranky ! Who.. Who is it? There's light in Guttinamane at this hour. Who's in there? Hello? Sir, we need to handle this bungalow's matter carefully. Remember Jayanth, who cut the sandalwood tree? He was found dead here ! And it wasn't just him. Three more guys who came, are nowhere to be found ! Cut it ! Don't blabber nonsense ! And call the ambulance ! Kiran ! Make a video recording of all of this ! I can't see shit ! You will, if you open the cap ! Hey, you.. Move aside ! Move away ! And you.. come here ! Sir, he's the one who saw the body first ! Sir, I found a watch here ! - Get it here ! Ramaiah, send this watch to the laboratory ! Do we have any witness of the incident? No witnesses, but they all have different stories to tell ! What are they? - The same old ghost stories ! Send the body for post-mortem. It's been a month since the death... ...of popular politician, Bhaskar ! The police department has failed to crack the case ! Let's hear what the local minister has to say about it. Look, Bhaskar Rai was an honest politician in our party. His death is an unbearable loss to us ! I've personally discussed this case with the Home Minister ! I can only comment further after the investigation's done. Could it be a case of political vengeance ? We'll find it out later ! Officer, it's been a month since Mr. Bhaskar's death. What is your department up to? - Sir, we're investigating... What are you investigating? How many more days do you want? If you're not capable of it, be clear. I'll get the right person to do it. Bengaluru Crime Branch Officer Karthik,... ...has already been handed over the case. You call whomever you want. All I want are results ! - Yes, sir ! As the entire state awaits the verdict of the... ...murder case of Journalist Gayathri Pushkar,... ...the real culprits have been sentenced. Officer Karthik's efficient investigation needs to be lauded ! *Calling out in unison* Having handled this high profile case like a super cop,... ...what do you have to say about the verdict? The real culprits have been sentenced in this case. And, I'm proud of our efficient justice system. Mr. Karthik, you're a police officer. You must be facing a lot of pressure at work. Have you ever felt that you're forgetting your family, amidst work? You have a wife, and have you ever felt... ...the need to pay attention to her? Nothing of those sorts ! Sometimes we'll have to manage multiple cases ! At times, we'll have to work all day and night. Good for you, Mr. Karthik Kashyap ! Keep working ! *INTERVIEW CONTINUES* Ugh ! He wants to work all day and night ! *SARCASTIC REMARK* And we have a worker here, who's never here on time. Drat ! Hello Atthe (Mother-in-law) ! - Tanvi, I've been trying to reach you. You never receive my calls. - Sorry, I was busy in the kitchen ! So only, I couldnâ€™t answer your calls ! Does Karthik work all the time? Or does he make time for you? Well, you know your son well ! Do you even plan to give me some good news soon? I get shouted at for telling him anything. I prefer to remain silent instead. Hmph ! - Looks like someone's complaining my mother ?! Hello, Mom ! Mother, I'll call you later ! I have some work to finish. - Sure ! Good Morning, Sir ! - Morning ! I'm sure the Commissioner has briefed you all... ...all about Bhaskar Rai's case. He did, Sir ! Make sure you report to the Bramhavar station today. Tanvi, did you not add any sugar? Oh, is there no sugar in it? It isn't tasty then. In the same way, Karthik... Our life too... - Come on ! Tanvi, this is no time for philosophy ! I'm getting late. I have to go now ! Undeclared words remain in me. And Iâ€™ve kept them waiting just for you. Pay heed to this call, my love. For I shall share this tale without a pause. You are the messenger of my desires. Come unravel them for Iâ€™m ready. Be there to console me ! And relieve me from my annoyance. While this moment of embrace with you,.... ...is being remembered by this grin. Come tell me, how do I not recall ? In this walk through memories,... ...I desire to see you. Pay heed to this call, my love. For I shall share this tale without a pause. You are the messenger of my desires. Come unravel them for Iâ€™m ready. Be there to console me ! And relieve me from my annoyance. Life is a big zero without feelings ! Come on Tanvi. Just relax ! Everything takes time, including our personal lives. I get what you mean. Why don't you both take a break? Everything will be alright ! God knows when that's going to happen. Madam, is Karthik Kashyap home? - He's gone out of town. What's the matter? What is it? Tell me ! Nothing. I had to meet him. Who was it? - I have no idea. He's been coming asking for Karthik. - Strange. Don't worry. Call me if you need anything. Okay. Bye ! Hello? - Namaskara sir. Is this Karthik speaking ? Yes, tell me. - My name is David. I had to discuss something with you. You've been trying to reach me. Tell me. What's the matter? I need to tell you something. Tell me. What is it? The thing is... - Just a minute. I'm getting another call. I'll call you back. Any leads? The case seems interesting. Let us see ! Okay. The post-mortem report's out. I've asked for it to be sent to you. Another thing. No match has been found... ...for the finger prints in the evidence. Please check our crime records. - Okay, sir. When are you coming here? - I was there for two days. Primary investigation's done. By Friday I'll be reporting. Okay. Another thing. Head Constable Ramaiah... ...from our department will be with you. And one more request, sir. - Tell me. There's an old house by the crime spot. Can an arrangement be made for us to stay there? A call was on waiting ! *PHONE CONTINUES RINGING* Master, please arrange the bungalow at the earliest. Sure Ramaiah, I am on it now. Don't break your head over this. I'm here for you. Okay, sure. Namaskara (Greetings) Master ! - Namaskara ! The Landlord's here! Namaskara - Namaskara sir ! What's the matter? On the 25th of this month, we have... ...organised the annual Yakshagana show. Please grace the event along... ...with your family. - Sure ! Are the preparations done? - We're doing our best. But,.. we're facing an issue. What is it? - Lord, someone's lodged... ...a complaint against performing there. Therefore, the officer has told us that he... can't provide the necessary permission. Officer, this is the Lord Mahalingeshwara's... ...annual Yakshagana event. And it's been a tradition for years. No law should obstruct the people's faith. Sir, the thing is... - Inspector! No more discuss on this. Okay? Sure, sir. - Let the event take place. Vicky.. Good luck with it. - We're grateful, sir ! We shall take your leave now ! - Go ahead. Mr. Krishnappa ! Didn't notice you. Please, sit ! - Had been to Mangaluru for a while. Oh, is it? What made you come all this way? Someone important to me, is visiting... ...our town to purchase land. They inquired about a place to stay. Our old bungalow's available. What if we prep it up a bit? You know all about that old bungalow. They're city dwellers. Why would they believe in such stuff? They're coming to buy land. If our estate impresses them,... ...they might buy the old bungalow too. Well, if you insist. Let them stay there. The key to the bungalow's been misplaced. I'll get the new ones made. I shall take your leave then. - Sure! Namaste madam. Is Karthik Kashyap home? I am his wife. How can I help you? There's a courier for him. Please sign here. Excuse me? - Huh? Why the delay today? It's 12:30 P.M. already. I got late only by ten minutes. It's only 7:30 A.M. now. Is it? This woman knows no concept of time ! Only 7:30 A.M.? Hey, Tanvi. I'm really sorry! I was just fooling around. What happened? Are you okay? - I'm not okay Karthik ! Sorry ! Hear me out, Tanvi. I'm really sorry. I was working all night. Couldn't make it home. Tell me, what happened? Karthik,.. The thing is... Last night... Tanvi...? - Nothing. I'll make some tea. I've informed the Landlord and have gotten things ready. Few more days, and everything will be alright. Let that be. What's the progress on the Bhaskar Rai case? You'll handle it, right? It's become a nuisance! There's no match for the fingerprints. We've no idea where to look for it. - Here. Have it. So.. The fingerprints aren't matching ?! How will it? When it doesn't exist! - Huh? There are four fresh bodies lying in the town cemetery now. Unearth them and try checking. It might be the right match. - Master ?! Was the fingerprint fine or inside out? What are you saying, Master ? - Listen to me! What if the fingerprints belong to the ghost? It will be inside out. - Master ! Tanvi, do you believe in ghosts? Huh? Why do you ask? There's an interesting case here. There's been a bizarre murder in a forest. The locals believe that a ghost committed the murder. In the meantime, the culprit has... ...fooled everyone and gotten away. What a joke, right? People believe in ghosts in today's time! Tanvi? - So, you don't think they exist? Why else do the locals believe it? Hey, why are you reacting this way? Nobody in the department has encountered them. Don't worry about it. We'll handle it. You get some sleep. Good night ! Huh? Kar... Karthik..! Tanvi? Tanvi.?! Tanvi, what are you doing here? Karthik! The win... Tanvi, what happened? - Karthik ! Clock...! There's nothing over there. - The TV... Tanvi, come sit down. - The window... ! Sit. Now calm down! - Karthik... There's nothing. Calm down ! Karthik, I'm having nightmares ! - There's nothing. Relax ! You seem disturbed. - But, the TV...? All this is my fault. I shouldn't have spoken of the ghosts at night. Calm down, Tanvi! Karthik, something's wrong with me. I really did see something over there. There's nothing. - I saw something ! Tanvi, it's nothing. Just relax. Let's do one thing. Meet Neeta tomorrow. Share everything with her. You'll feel better. I'll also talk to her. Okay? Try to get some sleep. There's nothing to worry. Let's go. *ON PHONE* I'll see. Sure Ya, don't worry. Tanvi? Tanvi ! - Hmm? Ummm.. Tell me something! You've experienced this even when Karthik was around, right? Yes ! If only he could spend some time with me,... ...it's easier for me to get back to normal. Of course. His presence, will make a difference. Human psychology is such. It always prefers a comfort zone. And when we miss it, there are chances of such incidents. On top of that, you're alone at home most of the times. This could be a reason. I'm definitely missing my comfort zone. There's no doubt in that. But,...! Neeta, I've never seen such disturbing visions all my life. Why are they appearing in my dreams? There's no specific reason for why we dream. But, it's all just random narratives... ...of our subconscious memory. You said that the clock had stopped, right? It was just an illusion. Also, the books you've read, the horror films you've seen... ...are all appearing in your dreams. Also, you said something about a milestone. What was written on it? - Umm.... Actually, I don't remember it well. It was something like... Net... Give me a second. - Sure. Hello? - Tanvi, I spoke to Neeta. She said that there's nothing to worry. - Okay ! So, are you feeling better? - I am feeling much better now. I had to receive certain important... ...documents from the department. Did you receive any courier? - Courier ?! Tanvi? - Karthik, I'll call you later. Neeta, I have to handle something... ... urgent. I'll meet you tomorrow. Yeah ! Sure ! How are you feeling now? I just spoke to the doctor. It's all 'cause of mental stress. Nothing to worry. - Thank you so much, Neeta! C'mon Karthik. It's fine! Take care, okay? - Karthik ! I've been observing for the last one week. She's very disturbed. She's facing minor depression. If this state of mind of hers continues... Things might go bad. Hope you understand. She needs a change in her life. Most importantly, you should give her your time. Yeah, I've noticed that. Why don't you take her out? Go somewhere. Get relaxed ! Everything will be fine. Don't worry, okay? - I'll plan for a vacation immediately. I'll take her out. - Okay ! Thank you ! This closeness is soothingâ€¦ How are you not paying heed to it? Shall I give my life to this hand reaching out? Should I direct this rising affection to you? Something remains to be saidâ€¦ Bestow your smile upon me ! Leave the piling up bitterness aside ! This closeness is soothingâ€¦ How are you not paying heed to it? In your path, I shall be present. As you look at me, unwind on my shoulder... ...for a moment, fellow companion. For I eagerly wait to shower my affection. Ask away as this allure remains thirsty. Something remains to be saidâ€¦ Bestow your smile upon me ! Leave the piling up bitterness aside ! This closeness is soothingâ€¦ How are you not paying heed to it? I shall be the milestones in your journey. Wherever you go, forgive me. For I shall pull you closer. Dear companion, I unknowingly surrender to your company. With you by me, the sun too feels refreshing. Something remains to be said... Bestow your smile upon me ! Leave the piling up bitterness aside ! You're Karthik, right? - Yes. And you are? Didn't you recognise me? The Master. Krishnappa*** Didn't Ramaiah tell you about me? Oh, Krishnappa the Master. He's told me about you. Did you come by yourself? Tanvi, my wife. - Namaste, madam! Looks like she's the silent type. I hope you didn't encounter any wild animals on your way here. Nothing of... - Why will you? Our people have hunted everything down. Nothing of those sorts. Do you have the house key? Sir, the key ! - How do you have the key? It's not of the house, it's from the jeep. Jeep? Oh yeah. He's Gopal. Namaste ! He's the caretaker of the Lord's house. Sir, asked me to handover the key to you. This jeep's damn good. Must have been very expensive. Ah ! How about we zip in the jeep to get the keys? You can take a look around. Shall we go? Let's go. - What about madam? Tanvi, we're going to get the key from the owner's house. Will you come? - You go ahead. I'll wait here. Okay. - Sir, here ! *EXCITED NOISES* Get in from the back, Gopala. Namaskara Lord ! - Oh, Master. Greetings ! Look who's here. I'd told you about someone visiting us to check out the place. He's the one. - Namaste, sir. Namaste, Karthik ! Please be seated. Veena, my wife. - Namaste ! And your family? - My wife's by your old bungalow. And my parents are in Mysuru. We have our own business. Very good. Ramesha ! Come here. - I'm coming ! What happened with the bungalow's key? It's with the key maker. We'll have it by tomorrow. Okay, you can leave. Master, make arrangements elsewhere for tonight. I'll get the keys tomorrow. - Okay, sir ! *SCREAMS IN FEAR* Ghost ! There's a ghost in the house ! What? Let's go ! Go check what happened ! Tanvi? Where did you get this key? Did the lady break the door open? Where did she get the keys from? Gopala? - Master ? Where did she get this key from? I have no idea ! Ah, Mr. Karthikâ€™s here. Greetings, Karthik. Prepare one for him. Umm... Mr. Karthik... Did madam mention where she got the keys from? She received a courier at home which had these keys. Courier? - Yes ! Who could have sent it? - No idea ! Fine ! We'll not know that. Look at the nature. It's a beautiful night. This farm, and the surrounding areas... ...together constitute 20 acres of land. Master, recently a mysterious murder took place nearby. Murder? - Is that true? Well... there goes my commission. Let that go. A murder did it happen. The locals however are bluffing about the ghost. You don't let it bother you. But why isn't Dharmanna living in this house? Dharmanna is an important man in this village. He owns over three to four houses. He'll stay as he likes. Oh, madam's here. Namaste madam. She surely is the silent type. It's a bit cold right? We're in a forest after all. It's not that cold either. Having lived in Bengaluru, this weather feels better. Speak of Bengaluru and my blood boils. Who knows what awaits Bengalureans in a decade from now? Oh, they're here. Namaste sir. How come you're here? Why? Should I not have come? Of course you can. All these belong to you. I was told about the guests at the old bungalow. I came down to check the arrangements. All set? - Of course. When I'm here... ...nothing can go wrong. He is Vikram Shetty. Dharmanna's son. He owns all of this. This is Karthik. She is his wife. Namaste ! Master.. I hope... The arrangements... are done right? I've taken care of that. Shettre, let's leave then. Let's give them some privacy. You go ahead. We'll follow you. How do you like the new place? Are you happy? It's nice Karthik. Thank you so much for bringing me here. Madam's looking beautiful in this moment. Ahan ! How come? Inspector Karthik seems to be in a romantic mood. That's 'cause Karthik's wife has filed a complaint on him. Is it? Alleging what? For roaming around like an idiot, instead... ...of spending time with his beautiful wife. So how does he plan to make up for it? Do you want to know? I'm happy after a long time, Karthik. Thanks to you. Master, do you believe in ghosts? *SARCASTIC LAUGHTER* I am a ghost myself. Gopala, come here. The locals claim to see Amma's (Madam's) ghost often. They claim it right? Have you seen it? I haven't. - Of course, you haven't. Duffer ! Shut your trap and walk - Master? I can hear some noise coming from over there. What noise? To hell with you ! Where did Gopala go? Are you out of your wits? Quit moving around. Let's move ! Never in my life will I tread past this way again ! K... Karthik ! Who are you? Let me go ! Karthik ! Who are you guys? Karthik, what happened? Nothing ! What is this old jewellery doing here? I've heard a lot about the temple, Karthik. Give me a minute. SIM card wrapper ! Karthik, do you remember today's date? 20th February. Why do you ask? No particular reason. Can you take me to the town for shopping? You want to shop here? What now? Will you take me or not? Let's go ! Okay. Is she okay now? Her health's getting better right? Yes. I'm with her. She's come out to shop. Look. You're in a new place. A village of all. Don't say no to what she wants. Keep this aside ! - Amma, I'm getting another call. I'll call you back. - Wait, when will you guys return? When will you..? It's been six months since I've seen him. He clearly has no concern towards home. Wait right there. I'll come. - Sure, sir. This is nice. That one too. Tanvi, I'll be back in a minute. - Sure. Go ahead ! Where are you? - Sir, I'm here by the circle. Okay ! Madam, take a look at this one ! Pack it ! Did you get all the documents? - All of them are here ! This is Bhaskar Rai's phone call records. And these are his bank statements. Spot inspection needs to be done today. - Sure sir. Here's the thing. You go ahead. I have an errand to run. I'll come once I'm done with it. Done with the shopping? - Yep ! Ummm.. Karthik ! A person wearing a muffler was following you. Actually, he's come home multiple times, in search of you. Ummm.. Who was he ?! With a muffler? - Yes ! Ha ! I forgot to shop for some important stuff. Go ahead if you need to. I'll take a rickshaw back home. Okay ! Ramaiah... What was Bhaskar Rai's social image like? Nothing to speak of. He was a political goon. What more can I say? Sir, I've found a key over here. Ramaiah... If only your department had done it's job right... - Hmm? - Sir, this key could belong to anyone, right? It's a clean murder case. Ramaiah ! This case is not as complicated as you think it is. And then the stories of ghosts... We don't intend to interfere in such matters. We've done as much as we could. Some believe in it, some don't. There's something about this place. Kishore? - Yes, sir ? Send this key to the forensics... ...and ask for the report. - Okay, sir. This bike's damn cool. Looks like it's brand new. Should try riding it once. It's thrilling to ride a Bengaluru bike. Chuck this. Check that out. That's a lot more cooler. *INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION* You...! What a mess ! Namaste, do you need any help? - No need. Thank you ! It's okay. You're our guest. - It's okay. I don't need it. Thanks for the offer. - Dhanya madam, let me handle it. Gopala, take this and keep it inside. My lord, we had to be somewhere right? But.. Err ! - The shops will close. Let's go! There's a lot to be done. Let's get going ! Fine ! Let's go ! Let's go, my lord ! - Darn ! Ramaiah, call this SIM company and inquire... ...about the shop this SIM was allotted to. Okay, sir ! Namaste ! - Where's Tanvi? Madam's inside. She asked me to wait until you come. Okay ! - Sir... Umm... ! Here. - I shall leave then. Tanvi ? Tanvi? - I'll get dressed up in two minutes. Okay ! Tanvi ? Tanvi, how much longer do you need? And this power cut ! Where's the candle? Tanvi, can't you hear me ? Huh ? Tanvi ? Oh my God ! Is it our wedding anniversary today? I'm really sorry, Tanvi ! I should have known when you asked for the date today ! I had forgotten. Tanvi ? Tanvi ? Tanvi ? Tanvi ? Tanvi ? Tanvi ? Where did she go ? Tanvi ? Tanvi ? Anupama Shetty... 1992 ? Tanvi ? Who is it? Tanvi ? Where are you? Tanvi ? Tanvi ! Tanvi ? Tanvi ? What happened? - What..? Wake up ! Are you okay? Here ! What happened? I don't know, Karthik. Tanvi.. Where did you get this Jewellery? This.. ? I found some jewellery lying in the drawer. I thought this was a gift for the anniversary. I don't know what happened after that. Don't worry. Must be 'cause of wandering in the noon. You take rest. Karthik, please come ! That's my first wife. She passed away a few years after marriage. Please sit down ! What's the reason behind your visit? I've been looking at land for purchase. Hadn't found anything impressive. But your estate's beautiful. I heard that you're planning to sell it. Wanted to discuss about it. How much are you quoting sir? About that... Master's handling it. We can negotiate around it. What say? Okay. - Well... Did you like the bungalow you're staying in? Loved it. I shall discuss with my wife and let you know. Anyways she makes all the decisions. You're right about that. Why are you being so rough with it ? Give it here ! You've screwed the trigger ! This is an old rifle. You won't find their parts anymore He won't understand that. Be gentle. Here. Yes, my lord ! Some tea or coffee? Coffee ! Coffee? Veena, get us two cups of coffee ! Hey, Rajshekhar ! My brother-in-law. He's a lawyer. - Hello, sir ! This is Karthik. He's here to take a look at the estate. He's staying at our bungalow. - Oh, I see ! Our estate is a very good plot. And the bungalow you're staying in? Is really old. You won't find a bungalow like that anymore. Isn't it? - You're right ! There you go ! - Brother, when did you come? Just now ! - Let me get you some. Only half a cup please ! How's the Kola work going on? - I'm coming right from there. Oh is it? - Yes. By the way. Why did you allow Santosh to take charge? He's a big fraud. - Brother, here's your coffee ! Let the event get over. We'll take care of him ! Nothing to worry. Things will be ready the day after. Have your coffee ! You're here at the right time ! On the 23rd of this month, we have the annual Daivakola ! It's a spectacle. You should witness it ! Veena, give them an invite for the Daivakola event. Sure, I'll get it. The thing is... The kola (performance) will be for the Panjurli God ! It's a special event. There's no way you would've seen it. Brother... - Ah ! Give it here. I'll be back in a minute. Please be there ! I'll be there for sure ! I shall take your leave then. I'll let you know about the land tomorrow. There's no reason to hurry. Take your time. Okay sir. - Namaste ! He seems familiar to me. I've been observing you. Why are you following me? Who are you? My name is David. I had to discuss some things with you. Tell me. What is it? One doesn't have to be a genius to solve a mystery. All one needs is the knack of finding clues from an event. Get in ! Where are you taking me? I'll tell you, sir. It's just ten minutes away. You might not know about me. But I know you very well. Come in ! Look who I've got here ! *IN KONKANI* Did Putta (Kid) come? Sit up ! Putta ? Oh my God ! I have been waiting to see you for years. I am Mary. I used to work at Dharmanna's house. Madam, was a gem of a person. She used to treat us very well. At first when I saw her,... She looked like a Goddess. On that day, Kola performance was going on in the village. *HUMMING A LULLABY* - Mary ! I'm coming. - Mary ! Here's the storeroom key. Today's the day of Daivakola right? I'll be going with my husband. I'll be occupied. You take whatever you need. Sure madam. - I need to be ready when he comes. You give the baby a bath and leave. I'll take care of it. You can get going. I finished all the work and left for home. Only then did I realise that the... ...storeroom key was with me. I went to return it. Madam? Sir ?! Please wake up ! Oh God ! Aye ! Mary ! What happened? - Madam ! Sir !... What are you doing here at this hour? Leave that. Where had you been at this hour? Whose child is this? And why are you so worried? Please stay quietly ! - Go inside ! I'm calling from Dharmanna's house. Their maid has hit Dharmanna's wife on her head... ...and is running away with their child. Please come fast ! What? Dharmanna's maid has attacked her and run away? Who is it ? What happened? - Run David, run ! Constable, let's get them ! Run that way ! David, run ! Almighty God ! You are that child, my son. Yes ! It's you. David ! The photo ? This is you. Dharmanna ? Madam ! When I picked you up from there and ran... ...both of them were lying dead. And now, I see that Landlord's alive. Something's fishy about Madam's death. I handed you over to the Father claiming you were an orphan. And in the morning, the cops were looking for us. Without knowing what to do, we left the village. For twenty five years, we had gone into hiding. A few years ago, when I came to Bramhavara. I saw Dharmanna's poster. When I inquired, I found out that he was alive. I also learnt that he'd married... ...Rajshekhar's sister Veena, and had a son. I came home and told Mary about this. Us finding you was the Lord's wish. Do something and make sure that... ...your mother's soul rests in peace. I can't make out if you're... ...telling the truth or not. But when I look into your eyes,... ...you seem to have suffered from a lot of grief. If you've really done whatever you've said. I am eternally grateful to your sacrifice. Mary ? - Mother ? Please give some water ! Drink some, Mary ! Mary ! Mary ? I came here for a case. But now, the mysteries are slowly unfolding. Which one's true, which one's not... I can't tell the difference. It's getting very personal now. Ramaiah... Get me the file of Anupama Shetty... ...murder of 1992 from the records room. Okay, sir. Sir, I have a doubt. Is this in anyway related to Bhaskar Rai's case? It might have all started from here, Ramaiah. If Mary didn't commit this murder, who did? This case was filed by a Rajshekhar. Who is he? He's a senior lawyer of this village. He has a good image. Isn't he Dharmaraj Shetty's brother-in-law ? Yes, sir. He might know something about this. I'll meet him tomorrow. - Okay, sir. You've handled the matter all this while. Continue doing the same. Do what fits you right. But one thing. No matter what, my name should stay free from this case. This is a matter of prestige. So,.. Did you guys visit any new place? We're going to watch Kola tomorrow. - Take him along ! If he refuses to come, tell me about it. He might be a big officer. But he's still my son. Also, he's still scared of me. Look at you. Like he's a kid. Does he stay home these days? He does. He works from home too. But, it's better now. - Okay then. If you want to share something, feel free to. Don't keep it to yourself. - Nothing of those sorts, aunty. I will tell you. - Okay. I shall go now. Have some errands to run. - Okay aunty. Bye. Tanvi, I'm getting late. Where's the towel? It's over there. Karthik... I have never seen Kola. It's happening tomorrow, will you take me? Okay, sure. And then... Is Madam not happy with the time I'm... ...spending or should I keep going like this? Quit your job then. We'll know how much you love me. Okay. Let's quit our jobs and join the temples? Karthik... Thank you so much. I'm really happy. I love you so much. Also, don't complain Amma about this. She'll torture me with her forwards on life. Okay. I won't. - Good ! Oh God ! Hello? - This is the old bungalow right? Yes, tell me. - Your husband has met with an accident. Please come soon. - What? An accident? Now he's all right. Nothing to worry. Please ask his parents to meet me when they arrive. Okay? Thank you. How are you now? I'm better now. What exactly happened? Well... Here Vikram. - I've taken Karthik's jacket too. No problem. - My bike's not working. So only I asked for this bike. Not a problem. - Is Karthik home? He's getting ready. - Okay. Thankfully the procession came that way. Or else... Don't worry. Take rest. Karthik? Thanks a lot. It's okay. Vicky. What happened? - Thanks a lot, Karthik. Is it hurting a lot? - I am fine Amma. Calm down. - Look, what's happened to my soon. How did you fall? Is it hurting a lot? What did the doctor say? Look for clues at the spot of the attack. Vicky wasn't the target. Let's see. Mr. Rajshekhar. Come in ! How come you're here? - Should I not have come? Or were you not expecting me? I was just kidding. How's your investigation going on? Investigation? How do you know about it? You're Karthik from Crime Branch. Am I correct? So,... Now you know all about me. And the reason for learning about me? I'm a criminal.... A criminal lawyer. It's a habit to learn about new developments in the village. Is that all? No. There's another reason. Bhaskar Rai was an acquaintance. In fact, we were childhood friends. If you need any information about him, do ask. I'll help you. So, you'll help me. - For sure. Let me directly come to the point, Rajshekhar. Go ahead. Ask ! - I'm not here for... ...Bhaskar Rai's murder case. I'm here to talk about the 25-year-old Anupama murder case. Subodh, why are you still here? It's getting late. Leave. And also, find out about the next date. Yeah, sorry. So, you were telling ? Anupama case ! - Anupama case ?! Let me think.. Anupama Shetty. Guttinamane case right? - Exactly. That case has been closed for years, right? We both know that the case hasn't ended, Rajshekhar. I'm here to complete it. You would have got all the information if you'd... ...gone to the police station. Why didn't you? I'd been there, Rajshekhar. Since there's no clarity in the file. I came to ask the one who filed the FIR. Okay ! Come on. Take your seat. Yes. It was me, who got the case filed. This happened twenty five years ago. I still remember well. On that day, the village was witnessing Kola. Look at God's play.. While the God was being worshipped in one place,... A catastrophe had taken place in the Guttinamane. We were all supposed to go to Kola together. I thought of taking Dharmanna along and went by his house. Dharmanna ! It's late. Let's leave. Huh ?! Dharmanna ? Who? Who is it? Huh ? Mary ? Aye, Mary. Mary, stop ! Where are you taking the baby? Rajshekhar ! - Dharmanna ! Please help ! She took... baby !! Hello ? Inspector ? This is lawyer Rajshekhar speaking ! From Dharmanna's house... Their maid has hit Dharmanna's wife on her head... ...and is running away with their child. Rajshekhara ! She's breathing. Come fast ! By then Bhaskar also came there. We took Anupama to the hospital... ...in Dharmanna's car. But... On our way there, she breathed her last. After which. We tried hard to find... ...Mary and the child. Police investigated everywhere. But it was of no use. Over time, the ...case was closed. Also,... Anupama's death... ...is still an unbearable thought for me. Anyway, you have all the case documents with you. You'll understand everything when you see it. It was... A very unfortunate incident. Thanks Mr. Rajshekhar. If I need any more information, I'll contact you. What happened sir? I think... ...they've misunderstood Mary's intention to help. Let's go ! Hello sir? What's the progress in Bhaskar Rai's murder case? We're almost there, sir ! I'll prepare the charge sheet within a week. The commissioner had called. He's assigned another important case for you. I'm handing over the Bhaskar Rai case to another officer. But the investigation is in a crucial stage. Give me four to five days, and I'll complete the investigation. No, Karthik. I've already instructed the new officer to investigate. But, sir... Hand over all the documents within 24 hours... ...and report to the Commissioner in Bengaluru. Damn it ! Sir, you seem to be upset. What happened? Sir, the fingerprints report will be out tomorrow. Ramaiah, leave me alone ! Sir, the thing is... - Ramaiah ! O weeping visitor in a ruinous fair... Tears aren't new to you, why fear then? On a full moon night, even the moon... ...sulks, unable to find Mother earth. Then why do you brood? In a gloomy town,... ...a tiny glow-worm flutters in glee. Then tell us O fool, why do you slump? Keep moving ahead ! The light from the mast, promises... ...to glow till it dwindles down. Such high aspirations ! Speak up O human, what do you own ? In death, you shall proceed alone ! The fault isn't yours, you lost soul ! Is it wrong to see no way ahead ? The fallen seed, is sprouting again... A life awaits you ! O voyager, stop not, proceed further. In a gloomy town,... ...a tiny glow-worm flutters in glee. Then tell us O fool, why do you slump? Keep moving ahead ! Karthik... Why are you here instead of coming home? What happened? I'm very disturbed Tanvi ! So only, I came here to be all by myself. What happened Karthik? Remember you were saying? That someone used to come to Bengaluru in search of me? I met him ! - Huh? His name's David ! - Who's he Karthik? Why was he asking for you? If I'm alive today,... It's because of him ! You mentioned a courier that came home ! The courier contained a letter which explained everything. The ones in Mysuru are my foster parents. My real father is... ...the owner of this village's **** Dharmaraj Shetty ! - What ?! What are you even saying? Dharmaraj Shetty ?! Twenty five years ago, my mother was murdered. I was saved... ...by this very David and Mary ! I am completely lost, Tanvi ! - Karthik ! My mother was unfortunately murdered ! There are a lot of things that makes no sense to me ! The Commissioner had called ! We might have to return to Bengaluru tomorrow ! Tanvi, who killed my mother? Who's behind all of this? I am not able to figure it out ! Karthik, even I am mixed up ! The key that came home ! And the bizarre experiences that followed ! The events that are happening in front of us ! Somebody's trying to communicate with us ! My heart's telling me ! Some kind of force bought us all the way here. The very force, will provide us... ...with answers for the questions... ...that is haunting us ! Don't worry ! I hope everything will be alright. You have to be strong Karthik ! Love you ! Today is the day of Daivakola. It's been twenty five years since I've lost you. As time goes, the memory of you and... ...the baby continues to haunt me ! Where did you find this? In this old bungalow ! How did it come here? Didn't expect this question from the one... ...who's supposed to answer everything ! I don't need to answer anything to the cops ! I'm not asking you as a cop... ...but as a son ! This... ...belongs to my mother ! The child that Mary took away... ...was me ! You never tried to find the child ! Before Mary died, she told me everything she knew ! I want to know the truth,... ...that you know ! It was the day of Kola ! I'd promised to take her to the Kola ! I got home late for some reason ! Why are you late? Where are you coming from? I had some work to finish on the way ! I very well know where you're coming from ! Rajshekhar called me to inform about this 'work' of yours ! Don't believe Rajshekhar's words ! He blabbers randomly ! You're guilty yet you dare to lie ! When I, your rightful wife is right here,... ...how low could you get to sleep with another woman? Anu ! Shut your mouth ! Stop right there ! Have you satisfied your passion or do you still want more? Madam ! I'd done the worst already ! I'll get the vehicle started, come quickly ! Anu ! Rajshekhara, get in quick ! - Start the car ! Rajshekhara, Anu ? - It's okay. Get going now ! But on our way to the hospital, Anu breathed her last ! Rajshekhar hid my mistake, and... ...saved my face in the village. Whenever I think of Anu, the guilt... ...of having killed her haunts me ! Nothing can beat the punishment... ...of having to tell my own son... ...that I killed his mother. Forget that I'm your father, and do what a... ...rightful police officer would do as per law. I made it clear... ...that I'm not here as a cop but as a son ! I... I learnt whatever I wanted to ! The law will take the next course of action ! But.. Here's one thing ! The fact that you're my father and I'm... ...your son, should remain between us ! Ramaiah... Where's the local government hospital? - Right here in Bramhavara circle. Tell me sir ! - I'm Karthik Kashyap, from CCB ! Yes sir? - Is there a Dr. Sudhakar Rao here? I had to meet him. There's no one by that name. - Err.. Please check. No sir. There's no one by that name. Ramaiah ! Okay. We have the address of this hospital. Okay. Wait here for a minute. Sir, have you seen the one in this photo? Dr. Sudhakar Rao... Actually, he's been retired... ...for nine years. Do you have his address? - Let me check. Thanks a lot. Here ! See you. Huh? Speak up you crook ! I will sir ! - Answer ! I will sir... Tell me Kishore. - Driver Shankar has been apprehended, sir ! We got it all from him. Hear it from him. Answer him ! Speak up now ! Sir, I'll tell you everything. Sir,... On that day ! Ramaiah, give me the file ! Who is it ? - Dr. Sudhakar Rao? I'm Karthik from Crime Branch ! Oh, please come in. Tell me, how can I help you? Didn't you prepare this Post-mortem report? It's an old case ! It took this long... ...for this file to come back to me. This was the only mistake I made in my career ! Ramaiah ! - Sir ? Arrange a meeting in Dharmaraj Shetty's house ! Also, follow the rest of the department procedure. One last thing. Ask the local officer to come by the spot. Anu, I'll go out for a while. - Dear ! Don't be late this time. We couldn't catch the.. ...entire Kola performance last time either. Be home early. - Okay. I will. Take care of yourself. - I will. Hello? - This is Karthik here ! Tell me, Karthik ! - Mom's murder... Sorry ! There's more to Anupama's murder. I had to discuss it with you. - Murder? What are you saying? *INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION?* *INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION?* *MUFFLED CONVERSATION?* Veena ? - Huh ? Let's go to the house. A meeting's been arranged at Dharmanna's house. Good ! - Sir, I think you've learnt... ...about Bhaskar Rai's murderer. Who was it, sir ? - What happened? Why did you call me ? Did I do anything wrong ? Have you hidden anything from me ? Has anyone told anything wrong about me ? Answer the question first ! It was I who committed the murder ! Every murder has a motive behind it, Ramaiah ! This one too. This murder has no ghost behind it. This murder was committed by Veena Shetty ! What are you saying? Yes ! It was I who killed Bhaskar ! Bhaskar's murder? He was constantly calling brother and... ...threatening him to ruin your name. Without knowing what to do... Veena Shetty took the driver's help. I don't know if you've observed... The tree didn't fall 'cause of the wind, it was brought down. On that day, you weren't home... You'd been to Bengaluru. I wore her saree that night... ...and took the bungalow's key. Veena goofed up, by leaving the... ...wrapper of the SIM in the old house. When the number was tracked, the driver got caught. I called up Bhaskar and threatened him. And then, I wore Anupama's jewellery. After dropping Bhaskar in the auto, he didn't return to the town. Instead, he followed Bhaskar. When he saw me dressed up like Anupama, Bhaskar got scared. Right then... ....Shankara struck him on his head. They planed it accordingly and killed Bhaskar. To make it seem like a ghost did it,... ...we put him near the old bungalow's door. That was when Veena's fingerprints fell on Bhaskar's watch. In a hurry to leave, they wrapped the jewellery.. ...in a cloth and left it in the cupboard. I found the key when I was inspecting the spot. That's when I doubted... ...that Dharmanna's house is related to this murder. I had to ask you something. - Sure. Go ahead. Do you know where the location on this mobile is ? Give me a minute. This is by the market. Ask anyone there and they'll guide you. Thank you. Ramaiah, send this to the lab and... ...get the fingerprint reports done. Okay sir. - The hair found during the investigation... Fingerprints.. Call records... Confirm that Veena Shetty committed this murder. Why did she do this? - To save your reputation... ...I committed this mistake. The inspector has learnt that I've committed the murder. Please save me ! Dear ? *INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION* Namaste Dharmanna ! Look, you might have learnt about me ! But I'll introduce myself. I'm Karthik Kashyap, from crime branch. Bhaskar Rai's murderer Veena, is already under arrest. But the question that's haunting is... ...what pushed her to commit this murder? Mr. Karthik... You're accusing a lawyer's sister ! Mind it! I'll handle this in court. Okay, fine. Mr. Dharmanna, tell me one thing. Veena Shetty, is your second wife. But your first wife's death was very mysterious. Can you recall what happened? I don't wish to speak of the incident. But I want how true your statements are. Just like tonight, it was the night of Kola. I, Bhaskar and Rajshekhara... Dharmanna, hold it ! Karthik, why are you after an old case? The FIR and Post-Mortem report says it all. It's very clear. There's no doubt in it. Okay ! Ramaiah ? Ullayya ! - Lord Panjurli ! - For what reason is my kin offering... ...their prayers in the form of this auspicious service ? Lord Panjurli, nothing escapes your divine awareness. Guttinamane Dharmaraja Shetty, the one you're protecting,... ...whose kin has suffered a mishap, requires... ...your guidance and invokes you... ...in need of elucidation from you. O, an invocation of truth from the divine power ! I have been showering signs on this matter since it began. I continue to do so. But the judgement day is here ! Fear not for those who have suffered will be served justice ! Fear not ! I shall now give you the blessed Sandalwood offering. We abide by the power, O great Lord. As per FIR, Anupama was murdered by Mary. FIR by Rajashekhar. Did you believe this to be true ? Or did you bury the truth ? Can you prove this wrong ? Mary has revealed it all. How long do you plan to keep the truth covered ? Fine ! I'll give you what you want. What Dharmanna caused was an accidental death. Nothing more. The report says it all. Don't act too smart Rajshekhar ! Ramaiah, get them ! There are certain things in this report that you don't comprehend. Please come ! Hello, sir ! - Huh? Sudhakar? You know him, don't you Rajshekhar ? Huh? Let me clear things. The Post-mortem report states two causes of death. One is traumatic brain injury, the other is Hypoxia. How can a person die in two ways, doctor? Could you explain this medical term? Hypoxia is when the brain doesn't receive... ...enough oxygen due to suffocation. This causes a person's death. This means, Dharmanna's shove didn't cause the death. Then why did you write this doctor? Rajshekhar and Bhaskar threatened me to write this. But my medical professional ethics didn't let me to do so. The real cause of Anupama Shetty's death... ...is suffocation caused by an external person. Therefore, I mentioned Hypoxia. Aye, this is all a lie ! What's the proof that I've done it? Dharmanna, they're all lying ! The report has been falsified. This was never in the report. Show us where the original report is ! Doctor, you're a government servant, don't forget... Shut your mouth ! For twenty five years, I've grieved over killing my wife ! You deceived your friend ! If you'd asked for the property, I would have given it over ! Instead,... like a pimp... you tried to sell your sis.... Aye, Dharma ! - Aye ! Stop ! You aren't even worthy of calling me by my name ! Get lost ! Get the hell out ! Get out of here ! Stop this ! How dare you push me ? How dare you ?! What do you think of yourself? How dare you insult me in front of everyone ? What do you think of me ? I'm an advocate.. A criminal advocate, Rajshekhar ! I'm tired of taking it all from you ! I'm fed up of being known as Dharmanna's... ...brother-in-law, Dharmanna's friend ! I too have an identity, know that ! And today he chooses to belittle me in front of them ! Veena, don't worry. I'll save you ! Aye, remember what you did after getting... ...drunk at my house that night ?! Shall I tell everyone about it ? Rajshekhar ! - Aye ! Shut it now ! All these years, I've saved you ! All this glory of being 'Dharmanna' is because of me ! I'll tell you something I haven't revealed all these years ! You've made a strong mix ! I'll get some water ! Dharmanna... I'll check out the Kola once ! You finish and leave soon. Shekhara, take it easy with the drinks ! You can't handle it ! - Pour some more. Enough ! Brother, I shall leave. Any offerings? Here ! A little more would do well ! This is all you get, keep going ! We'll finish this and be back soon. I've had enough ! Oye, Dharma ! Brother ?! Dharma ! Aye, I won't spare you tonight ! Aye, Mary ! Stop ! Where are you going with the baby ? Rajshekhar ! - Dharmanna ! Please help ! She.. took the baby.. ! Rajshekhara ! The baby ?! What the hell did you do ? What did you do ? What did you do at my place ? You raped my sister, and you came here... ...and murdered your wife ! - Rajshekhara ! Aye, I won't spare you ! Rajshekhara, listen to me ! Listen to me ! She scolded me in anger ! I just pushed her and she fell down ! I didn't do anything. What happened at your house, was wrong ! I won't let you get away ! - Forgive me ! Rajshekhara ! Please save me ! Hello? Inspector ? This is,... ...Lawyer Rajshekhara speaking ! I'm calling from Dharmanna's house. Their maid has hit Dharmanna's wife on her head... ...and is running away with their child. Please come fast ! - Rajshekhara ! She's breathing ! Come fast ! Hold her ! Carefully ! Oh my ! What happened ? Pick her up carefully ! Be careful ! Let's get going ! I'll be back with the key ! - Get it soon ! Come here ! Come aside ! - What is it ? What are you going to do ? - What happened ? Why do you have to save his wife ? How long do you plan to live in his mercy ? What are you saying? He's already finished his wife by half... And now... You complete the task ! - What the hell are you saying ? I'm saying the right thing. Hear me out ! The guilt of having killed his wife, will keep haunting him ! You wait for the right time and fulfil your... ...wish of getting your sister married to him ! He's coming ! Don't worry. Get started ! Brother, let's go quickly ! Start the vehicle soon ! Shekhara, get on soon ! - Rajshekhara ! Move it ! What happened? - Nothing ! Keep driving ! Rajshekhara, is she still breathing ? She is ! Keep driving ! Look ahead and drive ! Yes ! It was I who killed her ! Yes ! No evidence can harm me ! I'll close the case with the snap of my fingers ! Nobody can do anything to me ! Dharma and Veena who are facing punishment as per the law,... are awaited by the Guttinamane kin ! The religious traditions here,... ...continue to retain its value among the people. Strengthening itself with time ! People's opinion on Guttinamane has changed ! Karthik and Vikram continue to live peacefully ! Yes, did you realise who I am ? This is David ! I'm presently with Karthik ! Let's meet again !
