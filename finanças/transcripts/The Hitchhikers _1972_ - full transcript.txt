Your mom said you weren't home. - [Chris] Yeah, I've been at school and practice and... - [Woman] Well why haven't you been over to see me? - [Chris] Maggie, my dad's going to that convention in Seattle and I'm gonna go. - [Maggie] You can't leave now! Chris, I want to tell you something. Chris! I'm gonna have a baby. - [Chris] What are you gonna do about it? - [Maggie] I thought we'd get married.

I didn't even have any breakfast. - [Woman] Tough. - Well maybe I could buy some off you. - What will you give me? - [Maggie] 50 cents. (woman laughing) - 50 cents, no shit. What do you think this is, Safeway? It'll cost you a buck. - Forget it. - That's cool. Here. - Thanks. - Hey, why don't you sit down? How long you been hitchin'? - [Maggie] Long enough. - Where you goin'? - [Maggie] LA, where you going? - Just a friend of mine, he's got a ranch. - Yeah, what kind of ranch? - Sort of like a guest ranch, very exclusive joint. Hey kid, here comes a car, why don't you try it. - Thanks. Hey, we need a ride! Come on, it's hot out here. - If Benson were here, we wouldn't be sitting out in this dirt. - Who's Benson? - My friend with the ranch. Here comes another one.

We still use our thumbs, but (mumbles) a lot easier, we use these signs. (light peaceful music) Now the most successful card we got there is that student card.

You know, kind of help them lighten their load. Here, try this. - Maggie, there's a lot of ways to stop cars. Number one rule is don't look dirty. Now you take Brooke, she likes to wear blue jeans. Blue jeans ain't so feminine, it's hard for her to get rides. - [Brooke] Most of the chicks find it's a lot easier to get rides in dresses and shorts. I don't know, I just don't feel comfortable in them. - [Maggie] Well how can you tell which rides have the money? - Well you never know for sure. You take cats who drive Cadillac's, now they usually got bread. The only thing is, it's hard to get them to stop. - [Brooke] Don't (mumbles), under control. - She couldn't control a boy scout. - Best bets a travelling salesman. - How do you tell a traveling salesman? - You stupid, anyone you meet on the road is gonna be travelling, right? And if he gets in your path, he's a salesman. - A traveling salesman's got a special kind of look. He either drives a new Ford, or a new Chevy, or his flashy clothes. Anyway, he's lonely, he's away from home. He's always got bread. - How's this? - [Brooke] Nice. - You learning, you learning. (slow peaceful music) Hey come on, put a little lighten in the look. That's it, that's it. Hey, don't be afraid to move your hip. (woman laughing) That's good, you've got it. If you see a car coming down the road, look the cat straight in the eye.

Here, let's see. It must be under all this stuff here. - All right, don't move or I'll blow them off. - Geez! - Maggie, get the keys out of the trunk. Hands on the car, put them on the (mumbles). - [Diane] Okay, come on, get the stuff. - Hey, maybe there's something in the trunk we can use. - Get the shit out of the car! - Keep looking at the ground, move towards the front of the car. - I am, I am. - You move and your fun days are all over, buddy. Just keep movin' real nice and easy, that's it. Now turn around, look at those headlights. Keep your eyes open! Okay. - [Diane] Now now Karen! - Your keys are about a quarter a mile down the road. Now you go there, and you get them, and you keep on going straight. Don't try to go back to that freeway. You understand me? - Yeah, yeah. - All right, now you get up and don't look this way. Get up real easy now. That's it, that's it. All right, get moving! All right, let's go! (engine revving) - He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

Why don't we leave? - I wanna make sure he does what I told him to. - Green pastures, he leadeth me beside the still waters. I don't know what the hell I'm saying. They almost blew my ass off! Where's the key... Oh thank you Lord, thank you! - [Maggie] He's been gone an awful long time, where's he at? - [Benson] Shh, here he comes. Look at that bastard run.

Hey, would you sit down on here? - Sure. - I'm trying to get this cap off. That's what's been stopping it up. If I get this up, maybe it will work a little better. - Hey, that was really a trip last night. I've never had so much fun in my life. Are we gonna go out again today? - Nah, I'm gonna sit here and wait for Reb. I sent Karen out this morning to get them. - Who's Reb? - He's a (mumbles). He gets rid of the stuff that we borrow. He was supposed to be here last week but he never showed up. I don't like keeping that stuff around here just in case the man shows up. - Hey Benson, what would happen if they caught us with all that stuff? - Be nasty. But don't you worry about it. Reb's gonna get here, and he's gonna get rid of that stuff. Karen will get him here, she might get him here a little worn out, but she'll get him here. (loud rumbling) (girl yelling) Wow, speak of the devil. (woman yelling) Hey, what took you so long man, I sent Karen at 7:00 this morning. How you doin'? - How you been? - What's going on? - It ain't. (people laughing) Get this woman off me, will you... Ooh, get away. - Hey Karen. Man, I'm glad you got here. We got a whole store room full of stuff to get rid of. - Well why didn't you tell me that yesterday, huh? I would've been by today with the truck if I'd known it. How about tomorrow, huh? - All right. Hey, what took you so long? Man, Karen left at 7:00 this morning. (woman laughing) - Well she didn't find me until noon time, and it took us three hours to get here. - Three hours, man it's 15 miles! - Well you know, you don't get very far between pit stops with Karen. - Yeah, I bet you don't. (man laughing) - Let's go see what you got. - All right. - Whoo doggy, you got all this stuff? - Ooh, what is this? - Yeah, we sure do, we've been real lucky this time, everybody we hooked up has been loaded. - Mmm, you can say that again. (people laughing) You know you made the headlines. - Let me see that. - They got a description of you and Karen. - Oh hey, dig this, come here. Early yesterday evening at a lonely highway between Boulder City and Saratoga, Mason Lewis, prominent citizen and deacon of the First Baptist Church of San Jose, was robbed and beaten by a gang of female hitchhikers, led by a lone hippy man. Dig it, lone hippy man. (woman laughing) Mr. Lewis states he was driving down the highway meditating, when a young girl came into view. - That's me! - She was standing by a beaten up truck holding a gas sign. When Mr. Lewis stopped, he was suddenly overcome by a gang of girls as they came from everywhere. Mr. Lewis was molested. (women laughing) - Molested, what does that mean? - Baby, that's what you do real good. - Whoo, (mumbles) me do it. - [Diane] What is he talking about? We hardly touched him. - Here, you read this thing, I don't even wanna look at it. - Mr. Lewis was savagely beaten by the men and several girls. Mr. Lewis was forced to crawl on his hands and knees for almost a mile searching for his car keys, which had been hidden down the road. Stolen merchandise consisted of an AMPEX tape recorder, several coats, and approximately $237 in cash, which represented... - [Benson] Oh wait a minute, wait a minute. I didn't see no $237. - I didn't either. - Did you see $237? - No. - One of you girls see $237? Man, that son of a bitch is not only a liar, he's a thief. What do you think Reb? - I'll give you 100. - $100? No man, hey, no way, that's three weeks work. - 175. - No, uh uh. - What do you mean uh uh? I can't hock this crap, look at this! Hey, what I'm gonna do with this junk, man? The man's after us. - Hey, you ain't gotta worry about the man. The man don't even know what you look like. Make it 225 and you got a deal. We're gonna split anyways, no use staying around here. - Hey man, you cutting out? - That's right. Hey, I made enough money man, I wanna get out of here. - You know what, 50 it is. - Nah man, 225. - All right, 225. You know, it's gonna be worth that 50 to get rid of you. But I'm sure gonna miss them women. - I bet you are. (man laughing) - I tell you what, I'll come back tomorrow. - [Karen] Hey, wait for me. - Listen, I ain't gonna be here tomorrow. I gotta go pick up (mumbles), one of the girls will be here. (fun exciting music) (people laughing) Hey Diane, what are you doing there? Karen's ready to split. - [Diane] Well I'm not going. - [Benson] That's cool Diane. Maggie, you go to town with Karen, and come back early because I want you to pick up the money. - [Maggie] Okay. (fun light music) ("You Can't Get There from Here" by Potliquor) - [Karen] Whoa, that's the hottest car I've ever been in. How come you don't have air conditioning? - Well after all honey, it's only a Volkswagon, and I believe smoking that joint has made you really hot. - It's made you hot to trot baby. - Well I'm ready. - Better get it while you can. - Well how about showing me what I bought, darling? - There's a little peek. - Nah, that ain't a good enough, I wanna see it. - [Karen] You're gonna get everything you deserve. - Well, let me see. - You ready? - Yes, I'm ready. (women laughing) - Come on, let's get everything from him. Check his pockets, see what he's got. Turn him over. (easygoing light music) Ah, this man can't even afford any good damn shoes. - [Maggie] He's got a watch on. - Whoo, got some more money! Come on. Goodbye you sucker. (woman yelling) (light guitar strumming) - Hey (mumbles), look who's here, Reb's here! (woman yelling) - Hey Karen, would you cool it? You act like a nympho or something. - Oh shut up you bitch, you're just jealous. Hi, baby! - [Reb] You missed me sugar? - [Karen] Oh, where you been? - Hey, did you miss me? - Hi, baby. - How you been, darling? I missed you baby, long time, no see. - Benson said to get the money first. - What's this? You're supposed to get the money. - Not today, Benson's in a generous mood. - Oh, you're a cool one, aren't you? Are you gonna help me load the truck? - I'm gonna get the money first. - Cool it, big man. Benson's got his eyes on her, and besides, you got your hands full. - Ah, Nemo, let's load the truck. Oh. - It's all yours. - Come on, Nemo. - Hey Maggie. I've been waiting to get you alone for a long time. You and I are gonna have a nice little talk. - Yeah, about what? - About your leaving. - Am I going somewhere? - You bet your sweet ass you are. You're gonna get that (mumbles) working, straight towards LA. - I'm going to LA all right, but I'm going with Karen, Brooke, and Benson. - That's what you think! I've been watching you throw your butt in Benson's face every chance you get, and I have had it. Benson's mine. - Too bad Benson doesn't think that. - You bitch! (women yelling) (woman grunting) (light bubbling) (engine revving) - How you doin'? - How does it look like I'm doing? - Man I see you right in tune. Hey Brooke, give me a hand with my boots, will ya? - What the hell do you expect, all the attention I get around here? - What happened to you? Hey, I asked you something. - What does it look like happened to me? - It looks like somebody stepped all over you. - Yeah, well you should see what happened to the other party that you're so concerned about. - Yeah, what other party you talkin' about? - Who do you think I'm talking about? - Hey, you know what? I've been listening to a whole lot of crap from you in the last week. And I asked you a question, what are you talking about? - I'm talking about your girlfriend Maggie. And let me tell you something else, the crap around here has ended because I'm not taking it anymore! - Hey you know what, I'm sick of your big mouth. Now you get your big ass inside there, and you pick up all the shit I picked you up with and get out of here. - You can take the shit you stole from me and shove it up your ass! - If I come back here and you're here, you're in big trouble. Now Brooke, where's Maggie? - [Brooke] I don't know. - [Benson] Where is Maggie? - I'll tell you where she is, with a little luck she's at the bottom of the creek! - Maggie, Maggie! Maggie, Maggie!

When they made chrome, it just kept on shining. - [Benson] Hey, what about the engine? - So where are you girls headed? - How far you goin'? - Oh, down a road of peace. - We go as far as you do. - Ah see, I'm going down as far as Maine Street. - Let us off a little before.
