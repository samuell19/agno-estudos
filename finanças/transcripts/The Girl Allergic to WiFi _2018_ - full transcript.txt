I love you for so many reasons. Including reasons that are still unknown to me. I love your eyes. I love staring at them. The first time I saw you you looked like an anime character! -Dude... -What? -She's so pretty! -That one? She looks like an owl. Her eyes are so big. As if you are so tall... Wow, so much for loyalty. I wonder what section she's in. I don't care. From now on, buy your own Choc Nut! -Idiot. -What? Are you jealous? What? Are you into men again? -You dumbass. -You can tell me. Even if I were straight, I wouldn't fall for you. You used to eat your boogers back in kindergarten. Gross! Macha! It's okay. You'll always be my best friend. That's never going to change. -How sweet. Yes! -Can I give you a kiss? Idiot! Stop it, dude! -I don't want a kiss! Gross! -It's fine. Have you no shame? People are looking at us! -It's okay. -Hi. Right there and then... I fell for you. Excuse me, is this the meeting place for CA? I think I'm lost. Hey! Sorry. Come again? I believe God sent you into my life. But I'm not really religious. Except during exams. God is too busy dealing with climate change and fake news. We can pass this test on our own. You really need to concentrate? I'm asking for a miracle. I'm praying that you grow taller. Jerk! When you're done with your novena, I'll be in the library. Studying. Do you really need a reason to love someone? Are you just a dream? Please listen, love... That's mine, dude. The truth is... I can't explain why I fell for you. It was just instant. And it only got stronger. Wait for me... I guess that's what it means to be soulmates. Your eyes meet and you just know. It's like being in your own music video. ...that I would fall for you I'm here I hope you notice me A simple person who's in love with you A dream A dream Are you just a dream? Everything slows down and only the two of you exist. In that moment you know your life is about to change because at last after a long wait you find your missing piece. -Your corncob, ma'am! -Thank you. Thank you so much. What an epic fail! -She chose corn over you! -Shut up! -It's true! -Shut up. Bro! Coach, coach! -Hey bro! -What's up, bro? I left my wallet at home. -Can you spare some cash? -Sure. -Money's in my gym bag. Help yourself. -All right. Bro, are you done with my essay? -We need to submit it tomorrow. -I already emailed it. Do the best, brother. I love you. Aries, work on our assignments too! For a price, bonehead! Hi. Hi. Aren't you going to class? We just have a shoot for Group 1. Do you know my brother? They don't just know each other. They know each other very well. -Margaux. -What? Tell him. You don't need to hide it. Your mom said you can have a boyfriend since you're in college. That's right. She's your brother's girlfriend. Bro, why did you hide the fact that you have a girlfriend? Idiot. I didn't hide it. I mean, after me and Eileen broke up I thought she was just being a rebound. I thought you were going to focus on basketball. I fell hard for her. Imagine, we have been together for six months now. When the girl you like has a boyfriend there's really nothing you can do but trying to forget and move on. Bro, bro! Aries, join us! -There. Come here. Smile! -This is Instagram-worthy. But it's not that easy to forget if the other guy happens to be your brother. Duck face! Come on. Like this. -That's it. -Cute! And it also doesn't help when you two are the most Instagrammable couple on the campus. Bro! Bro, can you do me a favor? I promised to help Norma with her school activity. I forgot that I have a game in Letran. Very very wrong! What do I keep telling you? Never make promises you can't keep. Right! Your mom would kill me if I didn't put the cap back on the toothpaste. One day, he just forgets the toothpaste cap. The next day, he might forget me. Well, you never know. Honey. -Honey, honey. -What? You're overacting. -Well, bro? -You know how much I love you. Can you cover me? Look at that! I didn't know that today was National Bangs Day! This was Norma's idea. They look like coconut husks. Instead of criticizing, why don't you lend us a hand? No, thanks. The Holy Spirit might descend, and I would burst into flames. You can do it! Oh, Aries! Can you help me with this one? Okay, sure. Here. So, tell me... how long have you and Macha been together? What? We're not a couple. Meaning? It's complicated? Undefined? Together, but with no labels? We're just friends. Well, that's nice. I'm also single. Oh my God! Don't tell me you're gay. What? Well, you're not on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter or even Facebook. Are you hiding something? Do people still hide being gay? I don't know. It just seems like you don't share anything about your private life. I think that private matters are not for sharing. You know what's really weird? It's those people who are so concerned with the digital version of their lives... They forget to live in the moment. It's no wonder you don't have a lot of friends... even if you're cute. Bye. Bro. Norma? My brother wants to talk to you. Tell him I'm busy. Please reply to his text message. Let him wait. All right, bro. He really tried to be excused from the game. But his coach didn't allow it. I'm just kidding. I just want your brother to feel guilty. I often wondered how our lives would have played out if you didn't get sick. Maybe things do happen for a reason. Thank goodness it stopped. Are you okay? I felt dizzy earlier, but all of a sudden, I'm okay. It's just the heat. I'm okay now. Don't worry. Besides, your proxy is here. Your brother wants to talk to you. Bro. Yeah. I think she's okay now... Girl, what's happening to you? -Norma? -Norma! Norma! We can't find anything wrong with you. But I can't be imagining the rashes on my back. What rashes? I just noticed a while ago... that I have rashes on my back. Let me take a look. When is she going to be discharged? No word yet from Alex. He wants her to undergo a lot of tests. Can you please put that cellphone down? That's why you get dizzy. You never give your eyes a break. I'm just Googling something. What's that? Healing places on earth? I don't know if you are going to believe me. It's weird, but when I had the nosebleed, I felt better when I went to the toilet. And that isn't the first time it's happened. Every time I've had a migraine attack, I've always felt better whenever I went to the toilet. Is she serious? Does she really think this toilet has healing powers? I'm skeptical as well. But it won't hurt if we investigate. This is nuts. I have better things to do. This is a waste of time. There's nothing here. Aries... What? Dude, come here. Do you see what I see? That stain underneath looks like the Virgin Mary. Where? Gotcha! Macha, quit it! Idiot. I'm heading out. There's no mobile signal in here. I'm leaving. You're on your own. The Internet can prove anything, even the existence of UFOs. Where did you get the idea that Norma has EHS syndrome? The school toilet is a dead spot. There's no Wi-Fi, no cellular data. If that's the only place where she feels okay, it's possible that her sickness is caused by electromagnetic radiation. Come to think of it, she has insomnia now. She can only fall asleep in my bed. My room is a dead spot, too. -Right, Norma? -That's right. I have to be honest. There are still a lot of illnesses that science can't explain. I'm willing to explore alternative therapies for Norma's sake. Focus on the medallion. It's going back and forth. Your eyes are getting tired. Let's go. What are you doing, Miller? You're here to play. Not to fight. Get a grip! Get your mind in the game or get out. I'm in no condition to play. I can't get out of my mind, bro. I'm worrying too much. She's not improving? I spoke with her mom. Norma is having difficulty walking. She wants to bring her to the province. To her grandma's house. She's going to stay there for now. Are you okay? I really want to go with you but I messed up my last game. I really need to go to practice early in the morning. I'm really sorry. It's okay. I feel ashamed... for bothering you. Zack, leave the tablet. Don't be stubborn. Don't think like that. I'll visit as soon as I find time. -That's a promise. -Norma. Get in. We don't know what to do. If Wi-Fi is really making her sick, then we must take her away. I'll call when I get back. I'm losing the connection. We're near the bridge. Okay. Hello? Lex? Lex? The signal's gone. -Grandma! -Zack! I really missed you! You rarely visit! Here, there's no signal, no landline. But the air is fresh. There's no stress. By God's mercy, you'll recover quickly. -Wait, I think our lunch is burning. -Zack, go with Grandma. Are you going to leave me here? Let's just give it a try and see what's best for you. I told you to stop playing games. That's bad for your sister. But it's not online. Just do as I say. Drink your milk. You didn't finish your food. We've only been here for a few hours and you look much better. Imagine if you stay! What will happen to me and Leo? Come on. He'll visit. He can catch a lift with me whenever I come here for the weekend. -Weekends? -Yes. What about the rest of the week? You're going to focus on getting well. There's no signal here. I can't call or text him. He's going to get tired of waiting for me. Why? Do you burn calories while waiting? No signal equals no relationship? Then there's no point fighting for it. You'll just end up getting hurt. Was it Joey's idea that I stay here? It was our idea. We're one family now. Even though he's not your biological dad, Joey loves you. He's very worried about you. She's allergic to Wi-Fi? Is there really such a thing? Girls... I have something to confess. But... You have to promise to keep it a secret. -Promise! -Okay, okay. The truth is... -she's pregnant. -Oh my God. Okay, now I get it. That's why she went to the province. -To hide! -Exactly. Her stomach is huge. I saw it with my own eyes. Like a watermelon. I thought they were best friends? Well, it turns out, she's a fake friend spreading fake news! I want to smack her! Why would she do that to Norma? Some people have no conscience. She could put a troll to shame with the way she tore Norma down. The other girls were like keyboard gangsters. My God! Saying all sorts of things. They were making up stories. You better warn your brother. When these rumors spread, they won't spare him. He'll just get stressed. He's having enough trouble dividing his time between basketball and Norma. Exit towards Akeso Bridge. Stay to the left. Caution, bumpy road ahead. Where am I? When is he coming? Next week. He'll try to ask his coach for permission. He got lost on his way here. Why didn't he just come with Mom? He wanted to, but they have weekend practice. Is this working? Be careful with that. It's okay. Grandma will be pleased if someone uses it. I also play with it when I'm bored. This is amazing! This place is beautiful. It's like a museum. So much antique stuff. What's this? Is this what they call a Walkman? No, it's a recorder. Say something. Hello. Hello. Hello. Darn. Hello. I sound like a frog. Just terrible! -How do you turn this off? Turn it off! -Don't be too hard on yourself. -There... -You look pretty. Pretty... much in good shape. I'll tell my brother. Tell him... I'm waiting for him. You're getting addicted to selfies. -Don't you like being in my pictures? -It's okay. Take one shot. How do we do this? This is a tinfoil hat. I read about this in an EHS forum. Some of them wear these as protection from electromagnetic fields. Does this really work? It looks like a joke. Some say it helps minimize their symptoms. Fine. Teach us. Norma! Norma, you didn't touch your food. Norma! Pull yourself together. All you talk about is Leo. But where is he? I don't care what his excuse is. Clearly, he doesn't have time for you. Are you going to sulk forever? Be thankful that you got well! Did I really get well? Are you going to let me go back to school? No. Not until we understand what's happening to you. -How much longer? -As long as it takes. Here. Aries researched this. He wants to help. He's concerned about you. And so are we. I hope you can appreciate that. I've been calling you. Didn't you hear me? A friend sent me this screencap. It's from the group chat of the keyboard gangsters. Margaux has been feeding them lies! Look! Read them! I visited N last week. Her tummy is so big. -She's three months pregnant? -I wanna see. Get some pics next time! Will try, but I pity her. -Her mom is not supportive. -Why? Her mom just broke up with her stepdad. -And now, she has a new boytoy. -Her mom's disgusting. Are you okay? How could she do this to me? I never did anything bad to her. Just like a troll. She keeps hitting you because she knows you can't hit back. You're sick, and you're far from Manila. You can't even confront her. That's what she thinks. I can still get back at her. Don't stoop to her level. Don't feed the trolls. It ain't worth it. I have a friend who's good at hacking. Do you want to take down their chat group? Too easy. You know... She's not the only one who can make up stories. I can come up with fake news about Margaux. Something that will ruin her. But I will need your help. What's taking you so long? Come out! I look stupid. You won't be seen. We just need a picture of your back. Hurry up. Aries... -I quit. -Wait a minute! Come here. Hold on. Let's fix this. Turn around. There you go! Why can't you be Margaux's body double? With my height? Look, you're closer to her size. Don't be a wuss. Don't worry. You're still cute. What a pretty boy. And you look like a guy too! Are you mad at each other? Move closer. ...fall in love with you. My heart is too weak, it could break In another time In another place Maybe we'll be walking hand in hand In a different planet Or the stars you wanna reach Maybe I'll be there with you... There. I have a bad feeling about this. This isn't right. Technically, we're not doing anything. My friend is the one hacking Margaux's account, remember? Success! The photo has been uploaded to their chat group. Isn't your message too toxic? When it comes to fake news, the more toxic it is, the more believable. Dude, I think they got the message. "Last weekend we laid to rest N's baby." "I convinced her that it wasn't a sin to give her up." "My mom had two abortions before me." "I even looked for an abortionist for N." "By the way, it was a girl." "N named her Baby Margaux, in my honor." This is not something to be proud of! I can't even... Hi girls! What? -What's going on? -Baby killer! Baby killer! Fools! They all looked stupid! -Seriously? They cried? -Yes! Baby Margaux was a hit! One of them said, "I can't even..." So melodramatic! Are you all right? I still think what we did was wrong. This will not end well. Well, who started this? Margaux did! It's Leo! Babe! I thought you'd never show up. Did you do this? It's all over the campus. My teammates are not talking to me. They think I got you pregnant, and let you have an abortion! Is this your way of getting back at me? For not visiting? Babe, no. Bro, let me explain. You know about this? And you're fine with it? I am being summoned to the Rector's Office. The coach said I might get kicked out of the team. You don't know how hard I've worked for this. Babe, I'm sorry. -Sorry. -I'm sorry, too. Because I made a made a mistake with you. I should have ended this relationship before things got out of hand. My life may be ruined because of you. Why is everyone so quiet? Something's up? Is something up? You're just playing Words With Friends. Did you want us to entertain you while you were busy playing? You know, you're really cute when you're angry, honey. So, Leo... When is your next game? Maybe I can take the day off and come watch it. Next week we're participating in a charity event for Marawi. When? -Thursday afternoon. -That's great! Maybe we could all go get dinner afterwards? Was that true? So, that means you're not leaving the team? I'm really sorry, bro. I heard Margaux got suspended. If revenge is your intention then you've succeeded. Bro, you knew was Norma was up to? Why didn't you stop her? Bro, she asked for my help. If it had been you, you'd also have done what she wanted... especially since you love her. You still love her, don't you? I feel guilty for what I did. I should have listened to Aries. I shouldn't have stooped to Margaux's level. Dear, if you really want to get well, you have to let go of all that anger. Even if I get well, there's nothing waiting for me. Mom has a new family. In school, my so-called friends... were really backbiting me. And now, even Leo... has abandoned me. Kids nowadays! You waste your time on trivial matters, and on people who don't value you. Granddaughter. We can't expect to be friends... or have relationships with everyone. Choose. Choose people who will stand up for you. I still love him, Grandma. I want to explain my actions. Damn this illness! I can't even call or text him. If you're determined... there are ways. You can write him a letter. -Please hurry. I might be late. -Okay. I'm coming. Bro, I need a favor. Can you help me with my homework? I'll email it to you. -Sure. -Thanks, bro. Leo, a letter arrived for you. Who is it from? Please throw it away. You're not going to read it? May I take a look at it? That's not for you. Why are you going to read it? I'm just concerned. Norma might be in trouble. How dramatic! You think she'll slash her wrists like a victim in CSI? Men! You're so full of crap. You think a girl would commit suicide just because a guy broke up with her? Keep it to you, dude, okay? She just wants to make peace. I have a question, though. What's your role in Norma's life anyway? You are so involved in her problems. I must help her. "Babe, I'm sorry. I should have understood you better. You wouldn't have done it if you didn't really have a good reason. I didn't mean what I said." Good morning, dear! Here's breakfast. Grandma, you don't need to bring me food. Goodness! You might skip a meal again. That will make you weak, you know. And besides, I thought... you might want to read Leo's letter here. It just arrived. "Babe, I'm sorry. I should have understood you better. You wouldn't have done it if you didn't have a really good reason. I wish my love could heal you and take away all the pain. You shouldn't be facing your illness alone. I want to embrace you and tell you that everything will be all right. I love you more than anyone or anything else. I will always be here for you." I remember your grandfather. He sent me a lot of letters when he was courting me. You know, dear, during our time, when there was no Internet, it wasn't easy to love someone. To get to know someone, you had to exert a lot of effort. That's why I am pleased with Leo. I can see that he's really trying to be deserving of you. Bring this to your friends. -Let them taste my cooking. -All right. What did you write in the letter? She's too happy. She seems possessed. It almost got burnt. -I knew if she and my brother were good... -Okay, I'll get another one. ...she'd be fine, too. So I made it seem like my brother wanted her back. Are you crazy? I thought you wrote a closure letter, so she could move on. What were you thinking? Are you hungry? This won't take long. Thanks. You're giving her false hope. Hasn't she asked when your brother will visit? She thinks he still needs to focus on this game. He almost got kicked out of the team. She understands. You just want to pretend to be Leo so that even if it's just through letters, you can experience what it's like to be her boyfriend. Guys, Choc Nuts, last piece! Drop the act, and just eat it! That was my grandfather's favorite, too. When he was alive, my grandma would fill up a huge jar with Choc Nuts for Grandpa. I haven't been here for such a long time. That's because you're always cooped up in your grandma's house. Look at how beautiful this is! Yes, it is. But it would be better if I could share this on Instagram. To get a lot of likes? To keep a record. Our memory isn't reliable. If we use our phone to capture the moment, and we put it in our feed, even the small details will not be forgotten. Why are we so obsessed with remembering everything? Life is not long enough to waste on recording all sorts of things. If we forget something... perhaps it's not worth remembering. True. I distinctly remember you eating your boogers when we were kids! You're so mean. Now that's worth remembering. Right, Aries? It’s taking so long. -Can they really hear one another? -Of course! Didn't you try that when you were a kid? -I didn't. -Oh my God. Oh my God, guys, where have you been? Kid, can I borrow that? What's that on your head? A satellite. We're actually aliens. Hogwash. Game? Say something, Aries. Hello, hello? Can you hear me? What? Hello! Can you hear me? Nothing. Pull the string towards you. It has to be very taut. I love you. What? Pull the string, dude. We've gone everywhere. Not yet. There's a nice cliff over there. You passed it before you got to the bridge. When Grandpa was still around, we used to have picnics there all the time. We should be heading home. Grandma's probably looking for me. Let's go to the cliff. Are you crazy? If we go past the bridge, we'll get a signal. How much more will there be at the cliff? Think of Norma. We could always go back. Besides, we'll both keep an eye on her. Let's give it a try. So we can see if this hat works. Don't listen to him. Sorry. Macha's right. Bad idea. No, you're right. We're here anyway. -Ready? -Are you serious? Norma! You're an idiot! We're getting a signal! Are you okay? -Are you sure? -I'm okay. I'm really okay. You know you're not allowed there, and yet you insisted on going. It's my fault. I wanted it too. I thought I was fine. You should be extra careful. You're closer to danger because your birthday is coming up. That's just a superstition. That's next week, right? Yes. I'll be expecting you. We will have a small gathering, and I'm going to cook your favorites. Come. Let's eat. Aries... will your brother be here, too? I don't get you. Shouldn't you like it if she and your brother break up? You can make your move then. What if she doesn't like me? Then it's over. I can't visit her anymore. I can't go to her. That's your reason? Is that why you're like a plane in a holding pattern? You don't know if you have a landing field! This will land on your mouth! -That hurts! -Can I have some peace and quiet? You are so opinionated. This is too much. -We made that ourselves. -Really? -Let me see. -I hope she likes it. Happy birthday, Norma! Thank you very much! You know me well. I've been wanting to have a phone again. -Thank you! -Can I play with that? But that's our gift for her. Why don't you play patintero with us? -Come! -I don't know how. We'll teach you! Come, quick! It will be fun! Happy birthday, Norma! For you. Thank you. Where's Leo? He didn't ride with us. He's probably on his way. Excuse me? May we borrow Norma for a while? Sure! Go ahead. -The other guests aren't here yet anyway. -Thank you. We want to show you something. What is it? I can't see. -Careful. -What is it? Why did you make this? Aries had this bright idea. I hope it works. If it doesn't, I'm going to wrap him in tin foil. He made me work hard all afternoon, like a construction worker. With just the tin foil hat, you were able to walk along the signal area. I'm sure we can get further in this car. You wanted to go to the cliff, right? Ready? Ready. Norma, open your eyes! We passed the bridge. We're so far from the bridge! Come with me, come with me Trust me, for tonight I am your mysterious Propeller Propeller Propeller Propeller This is beautiful. If only I hadn't gotten sick, I would have wanted to become a pilot. Flying through the clouds seems blissful. -Happy birthday! -Happy birthday! Thank you! You even brought a cupcake. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Norma... I have something to tell you. Excuse me. I have to pee. Should we go back? I really have to pee! Bye! Macha is a riot. Norma... My brother's not coming. Did he text? I have a confession to make. My brother... didn't send the letters. It was me. Aries, I don't understand. My brother threw away your letter. I didn't want you to be sad, so I wrote back. But why? I thought, by the time you found out, you'll be back together. Even if you got mad at me it wouldn't matter, because you would have reconciled. You thought wrong. Leo still doesn't want to see me. He has probably forgotten me, too. No. I know my brother. He still loves you, Norma. His anger will subside. He will come back to you. Norma! I'm really sorry. I know I did something wrong, but I did it for you. Where have you been? -What happened? -This is nothing. Your guests are here, including the one you want to see the most. Norma... Really? You should eat. I realized I love you... Norma, may I have this dance? I just felt it now Now that you're gone I long for you, my love So this is what love brings You are always on my mind... Okay. Let's dance. Don't put up a fuss. Let's go. ...every second My lips say one thing But my heart feels the opposite This, I realized If I lose you completely I will wait for you blindly... Aren't you happy to see me? I am. It doesn't seem like it. Leo, do you love me? Would I have come back if I didn't? Do you know what you are coming back to? I'm not the same Norma who can fit into your world. I will only be a burden to you. Let's just do things one step at a time, okay? We have no control over what's going to happen. My lips say one thing But my heart feels the opposite... Life has no guarantees. Who would have thought you were going to get sick? What's important is that we're here for each other. My lips say one thing But my heart feels the opposite My lips say one thing... Mommy, where's Aries? I didn't notice him go. Don't worry about him. I'm sure he's okay. But my heart feels the opposite My lips say one thing Dude! Come on, get one. You'll find the girl for you. In the meantime, try Tinder first. Don't drag me into your lifestyle. This is better than traveling six hours for nothing. Just swipe and swipe! Here, look. I know that she's happy now. And... that's all I want for her. But... I can't get her out of my mind. Dude... Can you please give your body a rest? Look for a distraction. If you don't like Tinder, then... use Grindr. I promise, I won't judge you! -Promise! -Shut up! So choosy! Three, four. What's wrong? Does your back hurt? We had an intense game yesterday, so my body is aching a bit. Would you like to get some rest? Take a nap. You still have to drive later. Are you sure it's okay? I'll take a quick nap. Of course. Next time, I'll ask Aries to drive for me. Coming here is such a long trip. It's easier to go to Baguio. You're Leo's brother, right? Tell him not to ignore me. I get notifications via Messenger that he keeps playing EverWing, but he doesn't reply to my messages and doesn't take my calls. Wait, sorry. Who are you again? I'm Scarlet, your brother's girlfriend. What's going on? Look, I made a mistake, okay? My mind was all over the place during the break up with Norma. I know it's not an excuse. But it's done. All I know is I still love Norma. Bro... if you really love her... you have to come clean. She deserves to know the truth. Aren't you back together? Why don't you seem happy? What are you confused about? About these letters... These letters made me love Leo more. They gave me strength when I was really down. And now I find out that it was Aries who wrote them, not Leo. If you're happy with Leo, it shouldn't matter even if Ryan Gosling wrote the letters. Ryan Gosling, you know, on second thought now I'm confused. But you get what I'm saying, right? Aries said he was doing it for his brother. He felt we had a chance of getting back together. But is that possible? Is it possible to write a love letter for someone you don't have feelings for? Do you want Aries to have feelings for you? Is that what you want to find out? Bro, we're here. Bro. We're here. Please... Tell her. Don't fight. No fighting. Leave some for the other guests. I'll give you some later. -Go over there. -Let's go! These kids are a handful. Since we met them, they've been coming here often. They always hang out here. -There's so much food here! -Oh, that explains it. So that's why you hang out here! There's a lot to eat. No wonder you have chubby cheeks. You have to tell her. You're here for the food. Fine, it's because we're friends. Bro, let me do that. Yes, you better take over. Aries looks quite tired. -No, Grandma. I'm not. -Get some rest. Bro, what are you doing? Talk to her. I'll do it next time. Kids, come and eat. Does your brother know about the letters? I want to know why you did that. Haven't I explained it to you? You said you did it for your brother. Is that all? Is there no other reason? Is there another reason? I'm asking you. That's it. -Is this really effective? -Yes. Put it on. It looks hilarious. You should see yourselves. Doesn't it look good on me? It does. What looks good is you and me, together. You're so cheesy. Wait! Wait! Don't move. Stay still. Bro, don't move. This is for Instagram! Give us a smile! Who's that? Which one? The one on the preview window. There's a girl with you. Who's that, Leo? Let me see. Let me see! Norma, chill. Norma, wait. Please, just let me explain! -Norma! -Why get back together with me when you already have another girl? It's just a picture! We were just having fun! -Right, bro? -Do you know that girl? Aries, I trust you. Tell me the truth. Are they really just friends? Scarlet is just a friend. Why don't you believe me? Aries? They're just friends. You really are brothers. You're toying with me, making me look like a fool. Go home, and never come back. Bro, what's your problem? Are you mad at me? I'm mad at myself. I should have said something. I'm sick and tired of being used, bro! Being used? You've done it with your past girlfriends. Whenever you get caught, you use me as an excuse. I'm always here to cover your mistakes, it's not right. Are you accusing me of cheating on my exes? I never cheated, Aries. Then why did you have the picture of that woman on your phone? -I don't know. -Stop lying! It's me, bro. I'm not lying, Aries! I always give you some version of the truth. Some version? What the hell does that mean? Everybody lies, bro. Have you never lied in your entire life? Then you must be perfect. I pretended to be you and replied to Norma's letters. She was so depressed. And you weren't there for her. I needed to do something to save her. To save her? What are you, a superhero? I just wanted you to treat her right. Bullshit. Stop acting like a goddamn saint, Aries! If you have feelings for her, then be a man and say it to my face. You've got some nerve. You call me a liar. So what does that make you, huh? A poser? A hypocrite? A faker? Yes, I love her! But more than that... I have respect for her. And I know that she's in love with you and I respect that. You make her happy and I will never get in the way of what makes her happy cause that's how much respect I have for her. How about you? How much do you respect her? Fuck you. Get the fuck out of my face. Get out of here before I hurt you! Fuck you. Norma? Aries is here. He wants to talk to you. Your grandma thinks he hasn't gone home yet. He's wearing the same clothes he had on yesterday. He looks pitiful. Do you want to see him? She doesn't want to talk to you. She will just see you some other time. Did she say when? Maybe next week, next month, next year. It looks like you screwed up. You have to wait patiently. May I start waiting here? It's up to you. Okay. Thank you. -Hello, Ma. -Hello, Aries! Where are you? I've been texting you, but you never replied. There was no signal where I was. But I'm on my way home. Did you see your brother's Instagram? What's going on? Wait till I tell your dad about this, you'll be in trouble! I don't have Instagram. He's drinking with his buddies. And yet he was able to check in on Facebook. Where is this Tipsy Tavern? I know where that is. I'll go there now. Yes, you better pick him up. Who knows what he'll post next? It's embarrassing! Come home immediately. We need to talk. Yes, Ma. Sorry. -You've had enough, bro. -He's been drunk for some time. Your brother is here. Time to go home. Come. Let's go. Bro, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so stupid. I'm such a jerk. I'm the biggest fool. I don't respect women, especially the one I love. You can still fix things. We all make mistakes. I'm going to confess everything. All the lies. All the deceptions after being completely honest with her. I will admit even the things I can't give her. What do you mean? Dad once told me never to keep score in love. But I'm too selfish. Like all the hours I could have spent practicing my game instead of driving to her grandma's house. Even when I'm with her, I am secretly counting the hours. But with you it seemed so effortless. You've always been there for her, Aries. You made up for all my shortcomings. But you continued to love her without limit your boundaries. Bro, I don't deserve her. What she deserves... is the love only you could give. It wasn't my intention to steal her, bro. I know. I bet she makes you happy, right? She was looking for you during her birthday. You make her happy too, bro. Norma. Norma. Aries is dead. What? No! Mommy! What if something happens to her? We can't stop her. She wants to see Aries. We can't deprive her of that. Let's go? You go ahead. If you get sick again, we'll go back right away. I want to see Aries, too, but I don't want to put you at risk. Is that understood, Norma? -Zack, you're not coming with us. -No, it's Grandma. Norma. I saw this in the living room. I think it came from Aries. I can't believe this. What's happening? Babe, is this going to take long? It's the battery. I'm sorry I lied. I lied when I covered for my brother. And I lied again when I didn't admit... how I really felt about you. The truth is... I have never believed in love at first sight until I met you. I love you for so many reasons. Including reasons that are still unknown to me. I love your eyes. I love staring at them. I love the way you talk the way you laugh the way you look. I know I love you because it hurts. It hurts to miss you every second that we're not together. It hurts to be your friend because, deep inside, I want to be more than that. It hurts to know that I came into your life too late. But I keep loving you, anyway because just to spend another day with you it's worth all the pain. Remember the time we played? You couldn't hear me so I found the courage to profess my feelings for you. I also lied to you. I love you. I heard it. I heard it all. What are we going to do? There's no signal. Stay here. I'll look for a spot with a signal. Okay. He said it's the battery. Where are you going? I can feel Aries' presence. Norma... if only I had a direct line to God, if only I could text Him, I would beg Him to let my love heal you. I can feel it, Aries. I can feel your love all around me. Norma! Maybe in another time in a parallel universe you and I will end up with each other but for now in this world, this life I'm just happy that at least I got to even know you and secretly love you. And even if you'll never talk to me again I will still love you In ways I have never loved anyone else. I'm about to start falling In your arms I find hope When it gets dark and starts raining With you it's easier to cope All of my dreams and fears I've learn to reach and have steered myself away from After all this time You're still in my mind I feel our connection Don't ask any more questions I love you for so many reasons including reasons that are still unknown to me. I love your eyes I love staring at them. But my eyes are huge. I love the way you talk the way you laugh, the way you look. I know I love you because it hurts... It hurts to miss-- After all this time You're still on my mind I feel the connection Don't ask any more question Ready? When tears fall automatically Every time midnight comes When it's impossible to make you laugh And you don't smile anymore Hold on to me So I can sweep you With the freedom that joy brings Come with me, come with me Trust me, for tonight I am your mysterious Propeller Propeller The heart has gambled So many times I seem to always lose Whenever I love How? Is it possible not to get hurt? You can't blame me, I'm only human. Ooh, I'm only human Someday, I will be able to see The answers to the whys and the hurts Of the past It's all right to travel far If you know where you're going They point me to you Just wait for me Just wait for me. Dance slowly Every move has its own melody While the world Continues to turn It's possible that you'll always get hurt I have no regrets, because I'm only human Ooh, I'm only human Maybe someday I will be able to see The answers to the whys and the hurts Of the past It's all right to travel far If you know where you're going They point me to you Maybe someday I will be able to see The answers to the whys and the hurts Of the past It's all right to travel far If you know where you're going They point me to you Just wait for me Just wait for me Just wait for me
