This place is called Dry Well Lane... ...because there's a well here that's never had any water. I grew up here. Shujuan! Shujuan! Shujuan, it's come! All our furniture is here! We've put you to a lot of trouble, Liu Yunwei. Not at all. -So is this the room you've rented? -Not bad. I've still got a bit to go. Be finished in no time. Shujuan, come! -This part here is done. -Just this bit to go. So, you're all moved in! -Mrs. Lan, how are you? -Congratulations on your marriage! -This is our landlady, Mrs. Lan. -And these are all my comrades. Fixed the date yet? March 8. An even number! That'll bring good fortune. -What a pretty paper cutting you've made! -It's a gift, to stick on your window. "...the secretary of the Communist Party of The U.S.S.R... "...the Supreme Commander Joseph V. Stalin... Who's this Stalin person? "...passed away at 9:50 p.m. Moscow time... "...March 5, 1953.” Mum told me how because of Stalin's death... ...she and Dad had to put off their wedding for ten days. And so my birthday came later as well! Dad. Everyone ready? We're about to start! You stand here, Shujuan. Quiet, everyone! The wedding ceremony... ...Of Lin Shaolong and Chen Shujuan has begun! First, pay your respects to Chairman Mao! Oh, it's Guodong! What kept you? Guodong, quickly, sign your name here. Next, the bride and groom will perform something for us. On...On the peaceful soil... ...of the Motherland... ...life gets better every day. Lofty ideals for the young, and youthfulness for the old. Our workers love labor, production soars. The peasants work together and harvest ever more. We are peaceloving and never invade others. But we don't give peace to invaders or bad people. Please, Sis, sit down. -Don't be so polite. -Hasn't the hotpot come to a boil yet? Help yourselves to the food! -Shujuan, why aren't you wearing that dress I made for you? Sis, Ma wants me to put on that red cheungsam. She's even embroidered a great big flower on it. The hotpot..	. -Shuyan, go check on it, will you? -Ma, please, sit down. Shaolong, try some of this. I made it myself. Sis is an excellent cook. -Coming through! -Here's the hotpot! Eat it while it's hot. Shaolong! -He shouldn't drink! -Enjoy yourselves. Shuyan! Shujuan, your wedding today reminds me of the day... ...I was married in Yan'an. The comrades cleared out one of the cave dwellings for us. We each moved our bags inside... ...and there was a bit of a party. Just a few days later, he was sent to the front lines. He lost his life in battle. You are the Youth of New China. You must carry on the glorious revolutionary tradition... ...and make a contribution to the motherland. -Enough already! -Don't let the food get cold! All right. Come on, bottoms up! Shaolong, shouldn't you toast me? To you, Ma! Bottoms up, everyone! Look, this is the cheungsam ma made for me. Looks great. It’s a bit much to wear out on the street, don't you think? I like it. Shujuan!...come here, lower your head. What are you trying to do? In the past, brides always wore a red veil over their face. Well, I'm not doing it. Come on. Look how well this matches your dress. Please. Do it for me. All right. Who's there? Come on in! How could you have done that to me? Put me down! Put me down! Now! -What would people think if they saw us? -Let me down! Oh dear, I've dropped you. I feel really dizzy. Spin the other way, that'll cure it. Really? Then let's try. Okay, let's go. Here we go! Better? Better! Anyone home? Who is it? Coming! Come on in! Mrs. Lan, please, come in. Do you still need the gramophone? -Come on in. Have a seat. -I'll... I'll carry this over for you. No need. It's only a few steps. Take care! Get some rest, you two. Oh, no, look where he's peeing! -I'm giving you back to your mum. -You’ll go through this too someday. I was born after Mum and Dad were married just a year. Lots of aunties and uncles suggested names for me. But I was named Lin Dayu, "big rain"... ...'cause it rained the day I was born. Weijun's Granny didn't like that. She called me Tietou, "iron head". That way, I'd grow up strong. What's going on? The neighborhood committee... ...wants to talk to you about collectivization. Did you say I was home? -What a big mouth you've got. -Never mind. It's all right. REFORM PRIVATELY-OWNED INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES "A people's Daily Editorial." "Advance towards joint ownership of shops and factories. "In recent months, in cities throughout the country... Many privately run shops... have one after the other begun to... My dear girl! The state's already the joint owner of the courtyard. I live in this room here. And I've lowered everyone's rent from this month. Look, what did I tell you? Mrs. Lan has a high level of social awareness. Nothing else need to be said! Isn't that right, Mrs. Lan? Don't take it personally, Mrs. Lan. We're just going down the list. You can get back to what you were doing. Let's go! Sound the drums! The crow flying free. The old crow flies no more... Circling birds cry and caw. Little birds look for food... Who's there? Come in. Shusheng, it's you! This is Zhu Ying. Come over here. I've missed you to pieces! She's performer in the army song and dance troupe. Have you introduced her to Ma? Not yet. Shusheng said you and he were closest of all. So he wanted me to meet you first. -True? -True. Uncle's all dirty! You are dirty! What happened? He stumbled as we were coming through the gateway. Really? It's my eyes. I don't know what's wrong. They've dug a ditch in front of No. 9. I didn't see it. I want auntie now. All right, go to auntie. Give me your hat. I'll brush it off. - Have some tea. - Thank you! How have you been? Busy? Whats do you perform? I act in plays. We're doing "Growing up on the Battlefield". Zhu Ying, my sister's a primary school teacher. She's a real political activist in the school. Don't listen to him! When I was little I really wanted to be a teacher. It would be great to be an actor. Is your family far away? Well, yes, they're from the south. Go back inside. No need to see us out. Bye bye Uncle! Bye bye Auntie! Bye! Don't forget to see a doctor about your eyes! - Okay. Bye for now! - Bye! Mum? Can we sing the crow song? - What? - The crow song. Oh that! Okay, I'll teach you. The crow on the tree, the crow flying free The old crow flies no more, circling bird cry and caw. Come on, sing! That stick's too short. Granny! Could you get me a bamboo pole? Oh dear me, my little ancestor! Where are you going? Get down from there immediately! The kite! Get down! Weijun, get down from there! - Daddy! - Tietou! Daddy, the kite! Look at that child! What? Weijun, come on down. I'll make another for you. - Careful! - Be careful! Slowly, now. Shaolong! There's something I want to ask you. Weijun, take this for me. Shaolong, the district cadres said... ...that after collectivization... ...we'd be workers, not entrepreneurs. But look at this letter from my son. He says there’s nothing we can do about our class status. So our hopes are dashed, just like that? That can't be. Wasn't it going to depend oh your actions? That's what they said! But just look at this letter. LET A HUNDRED SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT CONTEND. HELP THE PARTY RECTIFY ITSELF. Oh, Yunwei! Get this thing off us! Tietou, watch your step. Hello, Granny, don't forget there's a meeting at No. 9. I'm illiterate. What do I have to do with meetings? Anyone home? Come to No. 9 for a meeting! Mrs. Lan, there's a meeting on. - What's it about this time? - The rectification movement. Put a move on! Everyone, to No. 9! "On April 27, 1957, Party Central issued the following directive... "with regard to the Rectification Movement... "Two reports by Comrade Mao Zedong... "...provide guiding principles for this Rectification Movement. "While this is a solemn and serious political movement... "...like a mild rain it also cleanses our thoughts." - Not so much for me! - Oh, go on. Guess what, guys...those two lost books finally turned up! Where? We were looking for them for days. Yesterday I skipped lunch to look for them. And I found them under the desk of the head librarian, Wang! Sometimes I think old Wang is away with the fairies. There was a meeting today that you two missed. I voiced an opinion on behalf of all three of us. What sort of opinion? Here are the noodles. Shujuan, how's the Rectification Movement going at your school? They want every criticism of the party... So what did you say? On our behalf? Oh, just something against bureaucratism. Actually, you didn't need to say anything. But old Wang sincerely wanted us to offer our opinions. It would have been awkward not to. -Teacher Chen! Teacher Chen! -Come on in! Hello Uncle! These are my students. She came in first in the district math competition. Shaolong, keep an eye on that pot. Come on, eat up! The Party wants us to speak. They said, "seek truth from facts". Daddy, my kite's flown away! Daddy will make you another one. Staff Officer Chen! Staff Officer Chen! - There's someone outside to see you. - Coming! Once you've gone, who'll take care of us? Staying home is the same as death. I must take revenge! Go then. But you're tearing this family apart. I haven't given you much joy in this time. Mother of Heidar, we've been together seven, eight years. I haven't given you much joy in this time. After you've buried my father, go seek a better life. I married you. I'm your family now. Ten years, twenty... I'll wait for you forever. Father of Heidar, just don't forget us. If I live, I will return. Heidar, do what your mother says! Father, I can't stay for the funeral. I'm going to avenge your death! Daddy! Daddy! Heidar! Heidar, your father has gone to seek revenge. We've just got to get through the hard times. When you're older, things will be better. - See it? - Yes, kiddo, I did. Tietou, your uncle's eyes are no good. Let's play airplanes. Ma, take these. - Shusheng, help me move this table. - Play by yourself. The bureau chief's only human. They were scared even to go to his office. - There is nothing to be afraid of. - What's this? - Sis is home. - He's just bragging. - Shuyan, is it? - Who else? He was saying how he criticized the bureau chief. Ma, that's what the Rectification is all about. Everyone's into it. You should hear what's being said! You don't know Shuyan. From the time he was little he's been fearless. I remember one time when he was still in primary school... ...and he had some sort of upset with Ma. He walked all the way to Fengtai. Ma was in tears! Tietou, what are you doing? Come to the table. Uncle, look what I've done! Oh no, that's my homework! Shusheng, why weren't you looking after him?! You were just being careless! It's my fault. I should've had an eye on him. I'm sorry, Uncle. Tietou is a clever little kid. Why didn't you have this checked earlier? Your eyes have badly deteriorated. You've got to take care of them. Your mental state is important. You mustn't let yourself get angry. Or even irritable. What I mean is, try to avoid any stress. If we can control it, we might be able to prevent total blindness. All right. It's no small matter. I have to tell her! If I do go blind, it'll be her problem too. I still say you shouldn't tell Zhu Ying yet. It would upset her too much. Shusheng, why don't you get a second opinion? Maybe there is a cure. Shujuan's right. Try another doctor. As for Zhu Ying, find the proper moment to tell her. She's doing so well at work. And she's about to join the Party... I fear, with my eyes, I won’t be able to be in the army much longer. Oh, Shusheng!...Are you a Party member? Shujuan said you were a hero as a pilot. I earned some merit, but I've never made it into the Party. I actually spoke up about this recently. I said I couldn't figure out why they just made me an officer... ...that they don't value us as they should. But I always feel... there's something missing. - Shujuan? - What's wrong? Mummy's crying! Aren't big people embarrassed to cry? Go away! Who's crying? I don't know what came over me. I'm fine! "On 25 May, Lu Yuwen of the Revolutionary Committee of the KMT... ...and assistant secretary-general of the State Council... ...offered unique suggestions for the Rectification Movement. Later, he received an anonymous, threatening letter. The writer called the safeguarding of socialism... ...and defense of the Party leadership "shameless"... He likened Party members to man- eating tigers. We should raise our guard against such political views. This threatening letter is a major political incident... and a warning to the great masses of people. Some people are using the Party's Rectification Movement... to intensify class struggle!" At Lin Shaolong's house, it was Liu Yunwei, Shaolong and me. Party Secretary, sir, I honestly never imagined... ...that Liu Yunwei was in fact inciting us to attack the Party. We were just making suggestions. What day was this? It's best if you write a detailed report for me. You're full of opinions and complaints. Don't forget, you're a member of the armed forces. Sir, it's just that I don't like dancing with the leaders. Wouldn't it be better if I could have the time to study? No, it's a political duty. We only assign politically reliable comrades to such duty. But why me every time? Besides, I can't see how dancing serves any political purpose. Watch your words. You know you're a key member of the troupe. And your application for Party membership is under consideration. You'd better not get too arrogant. I've heard that you've got a boyfriend. That's serious matter. Why haven't you reported this to me? But we haven't made any big decisions yet. Whatever the truth is, let me remind you... ...politics must come first. You know what I'm saying. Don't disappoint the leaders. Chen Shuyan often expresses dissatisfaction with socialism. He often makes reactionary statements to his classmates, together with Guo Tiesheng and Li Naijian, he manipulated... ...his classmates to approach the education bureau chief. But they weren't just offering suggestions. They wanted to throw out the system of socialist graduation exams! Guo Tiesheng, Li Naijian, get up there with him! Guo Tiesheng, stand up straight! Such extreme, reacting Rightist Elements... ...deserve merciless criticism and strong attack. - Say hello to Uncle! Come on! - Uncle! - What are you doing here with Tietou? - Granny's sick. I took the day off. Guodong, Shaolong hasn't said a thing to me. But the past two days he's been very depressed. Is he... Son! Don't worry about it I'll fix it up later. As for Shaolong...he shouldn't have anything to worry about. Some posters have named him... You've probably seen them. But I don't see why he should be in any danger. What about Liu Yunwei? Is he? Yes. But how? How could Liu Yunwei be a Rightist? It's impossible. Why is he an anti-Party element? I think you should go home. Don't worry about Shaolong. - Say goodbye to Uncle. - Bye, Uncle. We're going. Sit down and eat your dinner. What a kid! Careful of your head. - What's that? - Nothing. Shuyan, how many times have I told you? Young people ought to concentrate on study and thought reform. But you never listen. You're so arrogant. Sis, I don't think this is necessary, okay? This is worrying enough as it is. What are you worried about? Shaolong's all right so far. And even if something happens, you've still got Tietou. What are you saying? These are two separate issues. Forget it. I'm not getting into an argument. There's some leftovers. Don't panic. If anything happens. I won't drag you into it. I won't besmirch your glorious reputation. Auntie hit Uncle! The following people are to be rectified... In General staff: Zhang Yunming, Liu Xiaofeng. In Operations: Yu Jie, Xiao Jun, Su Changjun. In Supplies: Qian Yicheng, Hou Mingxin, Wang Kaiyun. Next, the Political Department: Hu Jinsheng, Wa Xiaogun, Li Yonggang. In Logistics:... Yonggang! Yonggang! Comrades... I ask you to give careful consideration to this matter. Could Liu Yunwei... ...be the only Rightist in this whole library? I'm not saying we have to come up with a set percentage of staff. But we have our responsibility to the Party. We need to take this movement seriously. RALLY BEHIND THE LEADERSHIP REFUTE THE FALLACIES OF THE RIGHTIST FACTION Why don't you approach your superior about it? How could you choose that moment to go to the toilet?! Tietou broke the window! Shaolong, come here quickly! It's not that serious. Don't hit him! Stop crying! I'll beat you if you don't! This is awful, now the two of them are fighting. It's all your fault, get out of my sight! Go home! Now! Tietou, stop it. Daddy's going to leave soon. Daddy's bad. I'm going to kill him. Daddy was upset when he hit you. Daddy's going to a place very far away. He's fixing up the coal we'll need for winter. We'll miss him a lot. Shaolong, take care of yourself! Be well! You're a stronger man than me. By the time you return, I may not be able to see you anymore. Chin up! And we'll take good care of Shujuan. Tietou, say goodbye to Daddy. Write often! And so Daddy left. Little Uncle left too. They both went to places far away. I only learned this many years later. Zhu Ying, there's someone outside to see you. Coming! How did you find me? I looked everywhere. A person doesn't just disappear. You didn't even tell me about your transfer. I don't know what to say. But didn't you get the letter I wrote? Zhu Ying, tell me, why? Please tell me, please. I'd like to know myself. Really. I'm not sure what happened. But Shusheng, we mustn’t see each other any more. It would be bad for your future. My future? How? Coming through! Have you had your eyes checked lately? Yes. Same old story. Have to take care of them. I've still got sight. It's just that my field of vision is smaller than other people's. The doctor said my vision will gradually become distorted. Like a telescopic lens. I'd see you even more clearly that way. It snowed last night. I thought of that snowy day... ...when Ma slipped on her way to the well. Shusheng, don't forget to help Ma fetch the water. How are your eyes, by the way? One night I dreamed Shusheng had gone blind. I woke up in a cold sweat. But they said it's the opposite of dreams that comes true. Why don't you see a doctor in Shanghai? They might have a cure. Tell Sis I got her letter. I reread it whenever I've got a moment. I've taken her advice to heart. Shujuan said Shaolong's gone away for work. Where did he go? Is he back yet? Has little Tietou grown any bigger? Does he talk about me? Something always upset me, one day when I was writing my self-criticism... Tietou asked me, Uncle, why can't goldfish blink? I wasn't in the mood. I ignored him. He kept repeating his question. I got fed up and hit him. He went to the window and cried. Tell Tietou that a thousand miles away... he's got an uncle who misses him very much...Shuyan. Ma, don't be upset. It's good for Shuyan. Nonsense! He's just a kid who thinks too big. Has Shaolong written? So he's... What's happening to everybody? Hitting your son again! So he asked for money and you hit him? You shouldn't be a mother. Granny? Whose vegetables and ribs are these on the windowsill? One of Shaolong's workmates brought them over... ...the one called Li. - Any letters for me today, Granny? - Yes. It came around midday. Oh, I must've given it to Tietou. - I told him it was very precious. - You sloth of a cat! I'll kill you! Ought to have done it ages ago. All my daughter-in-law can do is goddamn eat! Stupid woman! All over 50 cents! Tietou wanted candied crabapples. I told Weijun to buy some. It's not Tietou's fault to scrounge for food?! His father may be in labor reform, but he's not a criminal! And she blamed it on me! Tietou. Stand still. Who told you to go begging for food! You're a disgrace. Where's your father's letter? Give it to me. Come on! Where did you put the letter?! Go ahead and cry! You've got a nerve. Shujuan! That woman had made me forget everything. I had the letter on me all along! Thank you! Tietou! Tietou, Mummy was wrong. You can slap my face... So you'd really do it? No, I don't hit people. Let's play a game. What would you like to play? Frogs. All right, let's play frogs. Here's one for you... let's make a big frog. The crow on the tree, the crow flying free. The old crow flies no more, circling birds cry and caw. Little birds look for food, first feed mum and then the brood. I wait for mine patiently, for mum has always fed me. I'm never gonna sing for you again. I'm smiling because I'm so happy! I'm not singing for you anyway. Don't be like that. We have to sing for Daddy! Sing another song for Mummy, Okay? I'm going to write to Daddy and tell him Tietou can sing the crow song. Do you miss Daddy? No. Daddy said he's coming back very soon. Look, look! I've made one. Blow it up! Fantastic. He's as big as a balloon. That's a good boy! Mum, I want Auntie to tell me a story. That'd be a real help. I still have some essays to mark. Okay! Good, first let's tuck you in. Auntie will tell you a story. Little rascal! Once upon a time there was an old man... ...who was called the Foolish Old Man. Two tall mountains stood in front of his home... Tietou's such a clever kid, and really adorable too. Adorable? He's an impossible little creature. I can't work it out. Shaolong and I are so well-behaved. How did we produce such a little troublemaker? Shaolong calls him a born rebel. That's kids! They're supposed to be mischievous. How is Shaolong? Have you had many letters from him? Not many. He's all right. He's had some stomach trouble. He's probably not eating properly. Zhu Ying, have you seen my brother lately? No. How are his eves? Not too good. What's going on with you? He's terribly worried. You didn't do anything wrong. Why'd you suddenly leave the army? I don't know, but I had this feeling... Shujuan, I like your family so much, and I like your brother. I fear that if I continue to see him I'll get him into trouble. Does my coming here make you afraid? Don't be silly. What's there to be afraid of? There's no reason for you to feel afraid. I know, but I'm so apprehensive. My superior Officer came to see me a few weeks ago. He wants me back. He urged me to think about it. What's there to think about? Sign up! It's not that simple. I know what it will involve. I dare not think about it. You may think I was fine. In fact, inside, I'm so scared. I'm so scared! Zhu Ying has frequently stirred up sentiments... Against the Party, socialism and the People's Liberation Army. The court has ordered her arrest for counter-revolutionary crimes. Registered letter for Chen Shujuan at No. 6. There's no one home. I'll take it for her. Tietou! This is a letter for your mother. Don't lose it! Wipe out corruption, wipe out waste, for bureaucratism total distaste! One, two, three, four, I can play... Look at Tietou! Tietou, you can read now, can you? It's a letter for my mother. Oh, it's your mother's letter. The magistrate is furious. Send a man right away to apprehend... Heng...Lei Heng will be paraded in front of the masses. Hello, Granny! You've a letter from Shaolong. Your son is reading it. Is that so, son? Son, give me my letter please. - Weijun will see Tietou home later. - Fine. - Do you have candles at home? - Yes. I'll go home first. Weijun, don't tease him! Are you listening to me? Weijun, take Tietou home. Find your own shoes. Watch where you're going. Careful. Watch your step. Daddy was dead. He was cutting down some trees. One fell and crushed him. He died instantly. He didn't even have time to cry out. Will you have Happy Old Man firecrackers on New Years? Mum, I want a Happy Old Man. Mum, I want a Happy Old Man. I want one. Everyone else has them. You can watch the other kids set off theirs. It's not the same. I want my own! What if I don't get you one? You have to! Such a difficult kid! Mum, look, a Happy Old Man. - Have you thanked Uncle yet? - Thank you, Uncle! Uncle. Comrade neighbors: All must take part in the political mission... given to us by Chairman Mao of exterminating all sparrows. Take up gongs and drums, and don't down your weapons... until every last sparrow has fallen from the sky. Tietou! Tietou! Weijun, Bingzhen! Tietou, come on up! Give it to me, Weijun! Give it to me! - Why'd you let it go? - I didn't. It flew away by itself. Why do I have to go stay with Grandma? I have to labor in the countryside. There's no one else to look after you. Why do you have to labor in the countryside? To assist in agricultural production. Why do you have to assist in production? If there's no production, what would you eat? Are you taking these? - Can I go with you to assist in production? - I don't think so. - I'll be back after three months. - How long is three months? Three months is ninety days... and these shoes... How many days is ninety days? What's with this kid? So many questions! No one will play with me. Tietou... During the day you stay here and play with Granny... Then either Uncle Shusheng or I will come take you to Grandma's. On Sundays I'll take you to the park. Great! I want to go to the park! And I want another Happy Old Man too. O.K., you'll get another Happy Old Man. - So, you're off. - Yes. Granny, this is the key to my place. Fine, I’ll look after it. Tietou, do what Granny tells you! No need to see me off. Tietou, listen to Granny and say a goodbye to me. Bye Mum! Don't forget, Uncle Li. What? Oh, the park and the Happy Old Man. - Bye, Mum! - Bye! Food's ready! Come and get it! Line up! Don't crowd! Come on, everybody, line up! Any steamed rolls? Aren't you the gourmet! Which of your ancestors has eaten like this? This does show the superiority of socialism. Granny will give you a little treat. We mustn't let the communal kitchens be a drag... - ...on the Great Leap Forward. - Right! - Anyone have any comments? - No. - I fear the communal kitchen will disband. - Don't you worry. - This is steaming hot. - Eat up! Catch a whiff of that delicious fatty pork! Tietou's turning into quite a chubby little thing! How does it taste? Good? Ma, Shujuan has written. She asks you to look after your health. Tietou, your mother has written. She says don't be naughty She'll be home soon. Chen Shujuan, stupid old hen! What's with this kid? He hates his mother now?! Ma, I'm starving. Wash your hands. Everything looks so delicious now! Manual labor has that effect. What's happening now is so moving! Even the primary students are smelting steel. Come on, eat up! - Tietou, say hello to Auntie. - Auntie! - Come on and eat. - He's had his dinner. Isn't Shujuan due home soon? Three months must be up by now. Chen Shujuan, stupid old hem! - What's with you? - Don't mind him. He does this every day. I blame the school. Why'd Shujuan have to be the first teacher to go? But she volunteered. Even so, they should have taken her situation into account. Everyone has to do it sooner or later. What she did was right. I didn't say it wasn't. It's just that Tietou misses his mother. It's really sad. It's fine to be progressive, but not at your child's expense! Why are you so full of complaints, Shusheng? It's a fact. The whole country is caught up with the Great Leap Forward. You're on sick leave, you've no idea what it's like out there. It's a feat unparalleled in history. You must have heard at least! I've heard. How communal kitchens waste untold amounts of food... ... how the crude methods of smelting steel produce only scrap metal... What are you saying?! This is reactionary! This is a matter of political standpoint. Would I say it if I didn't care deeply for this country? Shusheng, you'd better watch it. This is dangerous talk. Tietou, what are you doing? Tietou, Tietou, I'm here! Tietou! Say hello...that's a good boy. Goddess of Mercy, infinite in your compassion... ...please protect Tietou in this moment of need. - Granny! - Is he any better? He's sleeping, why don't you get some rest? He's perspiring. He caught a draught playing in the doorway. Yes, that's all it is. No need to worry. I'll go home. Give a call if you need me. - Thanks. - Guodong, we've put you to a lot of trouble. Not at all! It's nothing. Take care, Granny. Shujuan, you ought to eat something. The food's cold. I'll heat it up for both of us. How did Tietou find this? It was your wedding present to us. Some things are so unpredictable. Look at this. It's so strange. Let me show you something. Do you remember Wang Biying? She died two years ago giving birth. Li Dongming died of dysentery laboring in the countryside. No one's had any news of Liu Yunwei since he was sent away. And Shaolong's been dead three years already. Sometimes, when I look at this cloth, I fear my heart's going to burst. Shujuan, I have to tell you something. You may never forgive me. But I have to say it sooner or later. I was directly responsible for what happened to Shaolong and Yunwei. I wrote a report for the leaders. Yunwei... I was so muddle-headed at the time. Only later, when Shaolong died, I did realize I was... ...a criminal. - Mum! Mummy! - Coming. I'm right here. Shaolong told me about this at the time. He mentioned it in letters as well. He said not to blame you, that you had no choice. Besides, Yunwei would have been a Rightist in any case. And Shaolong would've been sent to the northeast all the same. I don't doubt this. Guodong, let's not bring it up again, all right? Have another mouthful. Take it easy. He is more than full. All right. This is the last one. Ma, please! He'll get indigestion. All right, all right. No more. Go play now! Go play with uncle. You little devil! What are you doing? You've got big eyes. You mustn't remain in mourning the rest of your life. I don¡¯t know, since Shaolong's been gone. I've felt at a loss. There you go again. You're still not over Shaolong. But he's dead. You've got to come to terms with that. You're young, you've got a child. Think of the future. Sis, I know what you're saying. But it's the way I am. What can I do? He was so young. Now he's dead. I don't even know where he's buried. If he were alive he'd be a Rightist. And now? What's the line on him? This has to be cleared up one way or another. When Tietou grows up he'll ask, where's my father? How did he die? What am I going to tell him? You mustn't dwell on this. It's all in the past. This wont solve anything. What are you laughing at? I cant help but thinking about it... But the more I do, the less I understand. Well then, think of something else. - Bye Granny! - Mum, I'm going. Do what your teacher says and come back straight after school. Obey the rules! - You're back. - Mum... - What are we having for dinner? - Rice. - Is Uncle Li coming for dinner? - How did you know? If you've got three tins out, then one's for Uncle Li. Go do your homework. And mind your own business. - Mrs. Lan, will you come out? - Coming. Everyone look here. In these hard times, who can afford so many rolls? The question is: where did ail this flour come from? I've been saving it a bit at a time from my rations. Everyone here knows... - My son's coming today. - It doesn¡¯t take much to work this out. This much flour could only come from the black market. Take it away! But really, I did save it from my rations. - I'll never do it again. - Take it away! We confiscated them as a lesson to everyone. Don't worry. No one will eat them. They'd spoil first. Shujuan, the library came in first in the manual labor contest. I was named a model worker. Our school came in fifth. We've too many female comrades to do well in that sort of thing. This afternoon I handed in my application to join the Party. A member of the committee came to see me. Really? The branch is considering the possibility that next spring... "Silly boy on the doorstep there. He has no bride so he weeps with despair... "But what's he want a bride for? "When the light's on you talk, when it's off you're a pair. "And in the morning she will comb my hair." Uncle, pick me up. - Come! - Don't force yourself on Uncle. Come on, one, two, three, up you go. You all right? What's wrong? What happened? An old illness, nothing to worry about. Why didn't you go to the doctor? I've been so busy. Don¡¯t worry, it's nothing really. Did you hurt yourself? No, but you sure scared me when you fell! Uncle is very clumsy. - Does it still hurt? - No. If it doesn't hurt, pick me up again! Come on then. Hold it! That's him...Over here. - Did you call him names? - He called me names first. What'd I say? You, your father is a prisoner in a labor camp! Too bad for you, he's not. Do you have a father? Your father's dead. Pick on him and I'll beat you up. You think you're tough! You pack of little bastards, all ganging up on one kid like that. Aren't you ashamed of yourselves? Scram! Tietou, what are you doing? Don't throw stones! You're such a worry. - Uncle! - Tietou! - Uncle, why aren't you wearing your uniform? - Uncle's not in the army anymore. For me? Great! Like it? - Are you through with the paperwork? - Yes. These are some soybeans from Ma. Shujuan, I'm going to visit Zhu Ying in a few days. Shujuan passes on her best wishes. She says she misses you a lot. I've transferred to the city construction bureau. Haven't started work yet, though. I wanted to see you again while my eyes still functioned. If I waited much longer, I could be blind. Don't wait for me. What does it matter if you can see me or not? But please pass on my best to your mother and Shujuan. If you wait, I'll be old and gray before I'm out of here. - Who is it? - Me. Come in. Shujuan, could I have a glass of water? You're ill again? Why don't you have something to eat? You might feel better. I had something at my workplace. - Why didn't you come here for dinner? - It's no big deal. My parents sent some smoked ham and home made sweets. It's good stuff. I've brought it over for Tietou. The library gave us more cloth rations, but I have enough clothing. So I bought you some long underwear. You really shouldn't have. Are you feeling any better? - Much. It's really nothing. - You're always saying it's nothing. But you look terrible. You really have to look after yourself. As long as you and Tietou are all right, I'm happy. - Would you quit saying that? - I don¡¯t say it that often. But if it weren't for me, Shaolong would still be alive. It's only for Shaolong's sake, I... How many times have I told you? What's past is past. No need to think about it anymore. Impossible. I feel I owe you and Tietou so much. What are you saying? Owe us so much?! Guodong, you've got to go easier on yourself. Whenever I see you two, I can't help thinking of Shaolong... ...and unless I do something for you my heart's not at ease. Otherwise, I feel like I can't bear the guilt. So! You've unburdened yourself. But how do you think I feel now! Don't misunderstand. I mean, I've wronged you and Tietou. Don't you see? What more can I hope for? Wait. Are you saying... ...it's all a matter of responsibility and the repaying of debts? Thanks a lot! But I have no desire to be anyone's charity case! Charity? What do you think I am? I act according to my own conscience. You insult me by saying that. You're the only one with a conscience? Insulting you?! O.K., Li Guodong. I thank you. Go and take that stuff with you. Shujuan, you think I could walk out like that? I've looked at this as my home. I don't know how to put it. I'll go now. But don't be angry. Go then. And don't ever come back! Please don't be angry. You ought to know me by now. Did you really think of this as your home? Yes. I wish this were my home. Don't come any closer. Please leave. I'm so terribly confused. Ready? Attention everyone! I'll say one, two, three, then everyone say cheese. And we'll have a big smile on everyone's face. Ready? One, two, three. Cheese! Don't move! One more! And so Mum married Uncle Li. Everyone in the courtyard was in the wedding photograph. We got through the three bad years when there wasn't enough to eat. When New Year's came, everyone had dumplings. To this day there's no food I like better than dumplings. - Best wishes for the New Year! - Happy New Year! We're making dumplings as well. - Try mine anyway. - And ours as well. Thank you Granny! Good boy! Try these. Thanks! Bingzhen's mother! Happy New Year! - I've brought some dumplings for you too. - Best wishes for the New Year. We're making dumplings, too. What's in yours? Lamb and cabbage. Lamb's not cheap. I didn't dare buy too much. Everyone come to my place later for drinks! Tietou, come out and play! We're going to set off firecrackers. Wait for me. I'll get my firecrackers too. Happy New Year! - Hurry, Tietou! - Coming! - Do you have the incense? - Yes. Come back soon for dumplings. Mum, I want to light my lantern now. Why don't you do that after dinner? But everyone else has theirs. I'll fix you up. Whatever makes the kid happy. - Are you in pain again? - I'm fine. Here you go. Let's play! Let's play hide and seek. Palms up, palms down. Tietou, you're it! Close your eyes. One, two... ...nine, ten! Tietou! Over here! Weijun! Weijun! What happened? Tietou's come back. Son, you didn't even have to be called home! Did you set off firecrackers? - What happened? - My lantern got burnt up. Come over here. Come on, it's OK, I'll buy you a new one. - You can't buy one now. - I promise you I will. - I want another big horse one. - All right. Go wash your hands. We'll have some dumplings. Uncle Li was very ill. I visited him at the hospital often. About two months later, he died. The doctor said... ...it was his liver. They said he was overworked and malnourished. Tietou! Tietou! Come and play. After Uncle Li died, Mum and I moved in with Grandma. Mum said she couldn't bear to live in that courtyard house anymore. STEPFATHER Were you transferred to the county to teach? No. I didn't want to go. The school in the commune is a kind of flagship for the whole county. We've put so much into it I couldn't bear to leave it. Is she your girlfriend. No, just a colleague. We're just sort of interested. Shuyan, first establish a career. Having a family comes second. Yes, Yes, I know. Shusheng, how are your eyes? - Still not very good. - Have you been to the doctor? Yes. but it's no use. I'm taking... Tietou's home! He only just got home? He's away from home all day. He only comes back for meals. Hey, kid! Tietou, come here. Do you know who this is? You've gotten so big? Do you still recognize me? You're little Uncle! Not bad, Tietou. Hello, Auntie! Little Uncle had come back to show us his girlfriend. I thought she was okay. But I didn't go for her red cheeks. Looked like a monkey's ass. Li Jinghui can sing in the girl's chorus. He's got a damn good voice. Li Mei went to the boys' toilet by mistake. She sure ran out of there fast! Here comes the principal. Shitty, why is your bride singing with other people? You know, the one with the long nose and big ears... ...and teeny little eyes... - ...who snorts as she walks. - Fuck you! Fuck! Can't take a joke, Shitty? Your mum's a pig. Who are you talking about? Stop it! Stop fighting! It was only a joke! How'd I ever get a son like you? Are you proud of yourself? Aren't you ashamed? You don't ever think of me, do you? When can I ever stop worrying about you? Your father died young. You're all I have and you're so infuriating! Just have a fit one day and die. I don't know how I've survived so far. I've had it! Why can't you give me a bit of pleasure for once? Are you listening? You've really broken my heart. Think about what you're doing. Otherwise, I won't have you for a son! Ma, go back. We are not going that far away. Tietou! Do as your mother says. Don't let her worry, OK? Mum got married again. He was an old comrade-in-arms of Auntie's. Grandma and Uncle didn't approve. Mum said she was doing it for me. It was the first time I ever rode in a car. Bye Uncle! Bye Grandma! Bye! Goodbye little Tietou! Bye! - Loa Wu, dinner's ready. - Coming. - Tietou, time for dinner. - Coming. Lao Wu, dinner! The fragrance of the wine beguiles, the jade cup shines with an amber light. The host makes his guests so drunk, they no longer know where they are. You did well this time. OK, wash up and get ready for bed. No time to play. Go to sleep! - Mum. - Yes? Can I have some money? What for? You do nothing but make planes all day. - Mum. - What now? - Don't forget to wake me tomorrow morning. - I know. - Mum. - Now what? This kid! Nothing. Little troublemaker. - Dinner's ready. - Coming. The "maid" has called us to dinner. - Who? - The maid. What's with you, young man? You don't like me, do you? Pick up that rice! Put it back in the bowl! Do it! Tietou! Lao Wu, what are you doing? I'll eat it. Tietou! Granny worries about you. She wants you to visit. Is that... guy good to you? Oh, yeah! His own kids are not in Beijing. He takes me to the Zoo, and eat peppery lamb's stomach, too! - Really? - Of course. And in the evenings. he tells me tales from the war. He killed seven or eight Japs. Granny says to come over and play some time. Lao Wu, turn on the light. What's on your mind, son? Tell me. I want to go back to Grandma's. Sure. Don't be long. I don't want to come back. Why are you so miserable? I know you're not happy. Go stay with Grandma for a few days. You know, I'm not so happy myself. You silly boy, you know you're everything to me. Stay with me, please? On Sunday we'll go visit Grandma together. How's that? Xiao Er, come! OK. Hey, I want to play too. Greater China brand! Incredible! Let me see! - Blue Peony brand! - Your dad must be a big official. - What did you say? - Hey, don't go. Let him go! Let's just get back to our game. Little Uncle is home. Tietou, come here! Quickly! This is your stepbrother and his wife. This is my son, Tietou. Say hello. Hello, Stepbrother, Sister-in-law. You can go play now. Niuniu, don't fight with your little Uncle. Little Uncle, why did you get home so late? I've been waiting all afternoon for you. Is this a plane? No. It's a model of a plane. Little Uncle, can I play with it? Leave it. I've got to do my homework. Little Uncle, is that a kite? Will you take me kite-flying? Will you take me kite-flying? Little Uncle, will you take me kite-flying? All right. Let it go. I'll check on them. Wenying, come have a look. Kids! Asleep, just like that. Tietou, Tietou, wake up. Little Uncle! Little Uncle! What's up? The kite's stuck up high in the tree. The kite? Daddy was flying it just now. Daddy's dumb. He just started flying it when it got stuck. It's still there. Little Uncle, do you think we can get it down? No, but I can make another for you. Shitty, why aren't there any classes today? Sure there aren't. Even my parents didn't go to work. They stayed home. No classes today! What's going on over there? Boycott classes! Boycott classes! - Mum? - What? - Where's Niuniu gone? - I sent her home. What were you saying? He was asking about Niuniu. Down with Lu Wei! Revolution is no crime. It's right to rebel! Down with Lu Wei! Down with Lu Wei! Cut her hair off! Students! You can't do this! I will submit to investigation. You can criticize me. But please don't cut my hair. How will I face my children? Students! Mum! You're back! Mum! You're back! Mum. Today we struggled our principal! And we wrote posters against her and cut her hair. She's such a bad person. She scolds and punishes us. So everyone spat at her. I spat at her too! Bastard! - Shusheng, what day is it? - Friday. The seventh. Ma, are you asking when Zhu Ying has to leave? I know she has to visit her parents. Have some more to eat, dear. Tietou, you don't go to class anymore? We've burnt all our texts! But I go to school every day. It's a lot of fun. Uh...I... Any more dumplings? Let's make some more. There are still lots left. Tietou, what were you saying was so much fun? Nothing. Zhu Ying, have some more. Like they say, "Dumplings to see you off". You should eat something too. You've been so busy you haven't eaten either. Take care! Goodbye! Bye! Bye! What happened to Auntie Zhu Ying was always a mystery to me. I asked her why they put her in jail, then let her out. She said she wasn't sure herself. The Neighborhood Committee took over these rooms. Turned It into a storeroom for confiscated property. Mrs. Lan was sent back to her parents' home. I hear her father was a big landlord. Bingzhen's moved too? Where'd he go? Dunno. It's been six months since I've seen any of them. - Hello! - Hello! They're new. They've been here half a year. - Have one. - I don't know how to smoke. Ma, let me. It's cold. You should rest. Look, no one's here yet. They're all so busy. Ma, I'll put the food on the table. Relax, Guihua, it's all right. Ma, let me do that. This must be Tietou! - Say hello to your new auntie. - Hello, Auntie. Give me your jacket. Uncle! Tietou, have some candy. Here, take it! How's your mother and stepfather? Ma! Let me. Ma, I'll do that. Ma, let me do that for you. Elder Brother is here! I'll take that. Here, have a seat. How are things? Let's eat. Don't wait for Shujuan. She'll be here shortly. - Have you phoned Sis? - Yes. She can't make it. Not even for a marriage celebration! What sort of celebration can you put on these days anyway? Come on, let's eat. Tietou, eat. Ma, let me do that. Little Uncle, she's not the same girl as last time, right? No, that one had bad class background. - But this auntie is a bit... - Unattractive? Your uncle's stupid. Nothing I do is quite right. Don't take after me. Mum, one of my classmates has the best Mao badge. What are you burning? Can I help? You're home late. We were at Little Uncle's wedding. So even in these times people are still getting married? My new auntie is a poor peasant. Sit down. I've something to discuss with you. You too, Tietou. Stay and listen. Sit down. There's ash in your hair. I ought to have spoken to you earlier. I didn't think things would happen so quickly. There are a lot of posters up already in my workplace criticizing me... And there are more every day. What can I do? They'll soon come to the house. And it'll mean trouble for both of you. I've been thinking about it, and I've decided... ...that we should get divorced. I don't want to get you into trouble. Shall we agree? Better sooner than later. Of course, it makes me sad to do this. You can believe that. I really am fond of this kid. Even if he has never liked me, It's all right. He's a boy and boys are like that. Let me think it over, all right? Think of yourself and your child. Don't worry about me. This money is for you and Tietou. It's not much, but it should get you through any hard times. This is for little Niuniu. Please keep it for her. If you can, please help them out. Take it. Mum, let's pack. Mum, what makes you happy? Being with you. I wonder how Sis is. It's been more than ten days. I heard they put her through eight struggle sessions. Even hung a signboard around her neck. I'm so worried. Don't get too upset. This is a political movement. All the cadres are under attack. It's a revolution without historical precedent. They've been carrying out revolution most of their lives. There'll be no end to it. Ma, you mustn't talk like that outside the family. You must have the right attitude. I'm nearly in my grave. What have I got to fear? I've been so distressed by what's happening. Shuyan's so far away. We see him once every couple years. And Shusheng, what with his eyes the way they are... And you... you haven't had much chance to be happy. I feel...I feel I've lived long enough. Ma, don't even think that. Everyone's doing all right. Do me a favor and keep this safe. Come on! Get up! Come on! Still not up? Get dressed, quick! If he cant walk, get a stretcher. Hurry! Young generals of the Red Guard! He's got heart trouble. Cant you carry out your investigations here? No. Let's go. Move it! Look how ill he is! He can't take this sort of thing. Besides, he's an old comrade. Old comrade?! Try old counter-revolutionary! Please let him go! You'll kill him! Hey, she's Wu Leisheng's wife! Arrest her too! Down with Wu Leisheng! And you, you little son of a bitch! Let me go! Let me go! Tietou! Go home! Now! Mum! Mum! Let me go! Animals! You're beasts! Bastards! Little son of bitch. You dare bite me? Little counter-revolutionary! Beat him to death. Little counter-revolutionary! Get him! On November 7, 1968, Stepfather died of a heart attack. Mum was sent to labor reform as a counter-revolutionary. The crow on the tree, the crow flying free. The old crow flies no more, circling birds cry and caw. Little birds look for food, first feed mum and then the breed. I wait for mine patiently, for mum has always fed me.
