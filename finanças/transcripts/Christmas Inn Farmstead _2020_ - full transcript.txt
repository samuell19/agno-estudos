I checked the zoning laws, and you'd be good. It's a great home for a growing family. Well, we just found out it's twins, a boy and a girl. Can you believe it? That's wonderful, even more of a reason to get a house and quick, so are we ready to pull the trigger? I know we've looked at a lot of houses. Twenty-six, but who's counting? Well, this one is going to sell quickly, so if you like it, we should really jump on it, like, today, so, Paul, Ruth, is this your dream home? - Yes. - Yes. Yes! Okay! Lucky number 27. This next part is going to go really quickly. I'm going to go talk to the seller's Realtor, and we'll put in the offer. Oh, my god! Margaret, you have outdone yourself. My clients love the place, and we're ready to make an offer, 5 percent over asking. - It's not for sale. - But we're at your open house. You invited me to your open house because the house is for sale. It was for sale. - It's just been sold. - To who? We're the only ones here, and this open house has only been going on for 20 minutes. Maggie, Maggie, Maggie. These are for you: beautiful flowers for a beautiful girl. Oh, Chad. What a charmer. You shouldn't have. Oh. Think of it as a small token of appreciation for letting my client take a sneak peak. You can't be serious. Margaret, I asked you last night if my clients could get an earlier look, and you said absolutely not, but now Chad... Oh, hi, Julia. Didn't really see you there. You know, you kind of just blended in. It's nice to see you too, Chad. You're always popping up unexpectedly. - Boop. - I know what I said, but I owed Chad a favor. If you excuse us, we have some paperwork to get signed. You're not going to at least hear my offer? Let me remind you that the Realtor's code and practices states that every offer and counter offer... I know you have a reputation for knowing every rule and regulation in the book, but I've been doing this a lot longer than you, missy, so don't go spouting off the codes of conduct to me! My responsibility is to my client, and Chad's client is paying cash in full. I assume your client will need bank-loan approval and 30 days escrow. That's what I thought. Now, you really must excuse us. It's good to see you. I'm going to hang a swing from the tree out back. Oh, no. What's the problem? I'm so sorry, guys, but there was another offer, and we've been outbid. I... I know you're disappointed, but I... I am too. I think a bigger company would be better for us. ♪ Um, we will find you your dream home, though, and, uh, we'll get you settled in. Julia here, don't worry about her. Can't sell them all, right? Sorry. Sir, let's find you that dream home, yeah? - Yeah. - Let's do it. Here, take my card. Call me anytime. ♪ Ugh! Ugh! - I hate him! - Okay. Yeah. Let it out. Just don't wake up Dad. Also, quick question: Who's him? Chad Everest: the bane of my existence, the thorn in my side, the neverending pain in my... Okay! Yeah! Good to see that English degree is paying off. Your use of metaphors is riveting. He's the Realtor from Exclusive Realty who keeps stealing our sales. Oh, yeah. - That one. - I'm telling you. He stands for everything we're against. You should've seen him today mercilessly flirting his way into special treatment. He doesn't care about his clients. He only cares about getting his percentage. He would upsell his own mother if he could. Sounds like he's aggressive. Maybe instead of hating on him, you can try and learn from him. The only thing I can learn from Chad is that my career would be a whole lot easier - if I were a man. - What? How did you come to that conclusion? Because he's part of the good old boys' club. He using his charming good looks and sexy accent on all the female Realtors. He's heartless! So he's good looking and has a sexy accent? That's all you got from that? If I were a man, I would let him have it. Yeah, but you don't really want to be a guy, do you? Going bald would be the worst. Okay. I'm happy I'm a woman. It's just I've worked so hard the last 5 years, and I'm barely keeping my head above water. I just... I feel like the only way you can succeed is if you work for a big firm and you treat everyone like a number. Oh, my gosh, Negative Nancy! Coming from your little sister and your assistant, you're awesome! I don't know many female Realtors brave enough to start their own company, and most small businesses take time to get into the black. We've sold 10 houses this year. Yay! - Yay. - Okay. That was pathetic. Look, if you're just going to sulk, at least you can make yourself useful and sign some holiday cards for our clients. And stop letting that Everrett guy get to you. No, it's like Everest, a mountain you won't ever climb. - I might climb it. - No. - It could happen. - Not with that diet. I know it looks gross, but trust me. That's so good, it's disgusting. I know. ♪ Oh. Hey! Where are you? I'm at the 3300 property. I just needed to meet the seller and take some photos for the website. Seriously? You missed Dad's appointment again. - Crap. - I got distracted. I know. You're working, as per usual. - So what did they say? - Well, Dad is cancer-free! But he needs to stay stress-free and rest. Right, Dad? Yes. That's right. I'm so relieved to hear that. Okay. I'll see you guys soon. Bye! Ooh, just one more picture. I heard that. - I'm still here! - Okay. No more photos. Bye! ♪ Here you go. I cannot believe it's 10 days until Christmas. And we still don't have a tree. Oh, that's the last thing we need to worry about, Dad. - What? - I'm... I'm sorry, but I told Jenna not to worry about it this year. With Mom gone, you're more important than a Christmas tree. There's still time. You know, we can get a tree and get some decorations from the basement. No. Julia is right. It'd be a bunch of work, and the doc said I got to rest. Besides, Christmas was your mother's favorite holiday. It hasn't been the same since she passed away. That's so true. She was crazy about Christmas. Yeah. Do you remember that year that there was that terrible storm, so we couldn't get a Christmas tree. Jenna, you would not stop crying. You were convinced that Santa wouldn't come if we didn't have a tree. You screamed for 3 days. I was trying to figure out, how could I give her back to the stork? Not my finest hour. And then she got that crazy idea to decorate the ficus tree. Oh, yeah. That was so much fun, and we made paper ornaments 'cause ours were too heavy. I still don't know how you got the lights on that tree. Oh, you knew your mom. When she got an idea in her head, it had to be done. That was the best Christmas. She didn't even care that she was vacuuming up glitter for months after that. - And Santa came. - Hmm. - I really miss her. - Yeah. Me, too. Me, three. Jenna, refill the sugar bowl. What's this? Good morning. Sorry. Did I wake you? I always forget you're such a morning person. You always forget a lot of things. Jeez. Haven't had your coffee yet? I thought you were going to keep an eye on things while Dad was in chemo. I have been. What are you talking about? - Then what is all this? - I don't know. I'm working like a crazy person trying to keep our family afloat. The least I asked you to do is to keep an eye on things. You know how he is. He's stubborn! You all say, you know, "The less stress the better," right? Well, I know bills certainly stress me out. Great, so then you choose to avoid it. You keep asking for more responsibility but... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Can I have some coffee before the lecture? What's up? This is bad. They're foreclosing on the house. How? After Mom's accident and Dad got sick, he had to take out a second mortgage. I knew he was in trouble, so I moved back in to try to help, but I guess it wasn't enough. I'm sorry, but maybe someone should've told me. You keep saying I can't handle responsibility, but you don't keep me in the loop. You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you, but that was 2 years ago. I thought things were better than this. What about Dad's pension from the Navy? It helps, but it's not enough. Plus I can't do that part-time job anymore, so... Julia, we can't lose the house. We won't. I promise. I just need to think. You need to learn how to ask for help. What about Dad? Does he know? Obviously he knows he's behind, but probably not that it's this bad. Whatever you do, don't tell him. Obviously. The stress could literally kill him. How do I... we... come up with $20,000? We could rob a bank. Doesn't your ex-boyfriend, Tim, work at the bank? What does that have to do with robbing it? Well, we could talk to him. - About robbing the bank? - We're not robbing the bank! Hmm. ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah Thanks for meeting with us. Yeah. I, um, really like your tie. You always look so handsome in green. And blue. So, um, can you help us? I really wish that there was something I could do. Oh, uh, did Jenna tell you our father just finished cancer treatments? I heard. I'm so sorry to hear about that. Well, you can't pull some kind of favor, not even for me? You know, if I could do it for anyone, it'd be you, Jenna, but the foreclosure paperwork has already been turned in, and it's out of my hands. Well, thanks for trying, Tim. - I really appreciate it. - Sure. You... you know, I'd do anything for you, Jenna. - I mean it. - I know you would. Uh, thanks, Tim. Uh, can you keep this conversation between us? I know our families are close, but you know how word travels fast. We should get going. We haven't had the heart to tell our dad yet. - Yes. We, uh... - I'll keep it a secret. My mom is upset enough about the Erikson farmstead being sold. Is... isn't that the Christmas inn? Yeah. Donna called my mom this morning, wanted her to hear the news personally before it got out. You know, that's where my parents got married, and now my mom caters weddings there. She's devastated. Do you happen to know who the listing Realtor is? I don't think they have a Realtor yet. The owner just decided to sell this morning before she called my mom. Thanks, Tim. You've been unbelievably helpful. We should... we should run. Oh, run. Oh, really? I didn't do much. Jenna, it was good to see you. Yeah. - Uh, call me. - Oh, okay. I don't think I have your new number. "Call me." What was I thinking? I don't want him to call me. Wait. Do I want him to call me? Really? That was your takeaway? Were you even listening? - The Erikson farmstead! - I know. It's being sold, totally tragic for them. Absolutely great for us. We need to get that listing! Yes, okay. Wait. What are you doing? Calling the farmstead. Hi. This is Jenna Rogers from Rogers Realty. Can I speak to Donna? Hi, Donna. This is Jenna from Rogers Realty. We saw that you're selling the farmstead, and we would love to help out. Okay. Great. Thanks. - So what did she say? - Oh. She said she wants to see us at 2 o'clock, and they'd love to work with us! ♪ I didn't realize how far outside the city it was. - Wow. - Look at this place. It's like we're driving into a snow globe. Well, I don't smell any cows yet so that's a good sign. I don't think it's that kind of farm, Jenna. Okay. Here we go. - Wow. - This place is beautiful. - I love it. - I know. We'll need a hook. Um, Christmas fun for everybody. No. - No, no. - Okay. A place where... A place to reconnect with your Christmas spirit! Cute. Catchy. - I like it. - Oh, yeah. Let's just hope the owners do too. Okay. You ready for this? The real question is, are you? Hello. - How can I help you? - Hi. Yes. We called earlier. We're supposed to be meeting the owners at 2 o'clock. Let me guess. You guys heard this place is for sale, and you're Realtors. Wow. - Good guess. - Uh, yeah. Actually, we'd love to help find a buyer for it enchanting place. Across the drive to the carriage house. ♪ Oh, man. This place is going to photograph beautifully. Yay! I'm so excited! I just hope we can convince Donna that we're the Realtors for the job before anyone else finds out. ♪ ♪ Wow. News travels fast. Like elves to candy. Welcome, everyone. Welcome. Welcome. Boy, what a turnout. Thank you all for coming on such short notice. We know how busy life can get. Yes. I am Herb, and this is my beautiful wife, Donna, and we've had the privilege of owning and operating the Erikson farmstead now for 30 years. The reason why we gathered you all here together... ♪ My deepest apologies for being late. Just closed a deal. Right. Chad Everest, Exclusive Realty. - Oh, good to meet you, Chad. - Of course he would be here. Is that the mountain? You're right. - He is pretty. - Hmm. You wouldn't think that if you knew him. - All right. - So as I was saying, the reason that we have gathered you all here today... We're old and tired. Yes. Yes. We have put this off long enough. It is time, so, uh, we're retiring, and we... We need to sell the place. Our daughter lives in Arizona, and she has her own career, so we're looking for a buyer who will value and love the farmstead as much as we have throughout the years, someone who will continue the traditions. Which is why we have invited you all here today and why we're going to invite you to be our guests here at the farmstead for the next week. Now, we booked a few rooms out to our regular customers, but we've got plenty of availability. We promise to make your time here special, and we'll get you back to your loved ones in plenty of time for Christmas. You can't really understand this place until you've experienced its magic, so after the first week, Donna and I, we're going to decide which Realtor we believe is the best fit. So you want us to, like, what, fight against each other like we're gladiators? No. We... we don't want any fighting here. We just want some friendly competition mixed with some rest and relaxation. We know it's a bit unconventional, but so are we. Yeah. Why rush this if you love it so much? Well, our daughter is pregnant. Our first grandchild is on the way, so we're eager to sell, move to Arizona and start our new careers as babysitters. Once we get the call, we'll be on our way to Arizona, and our assistant, Sarah, will be taking over for us here. So the goal is for us to have the farmstead on the market right after Christmas. Yeah. That's not a lot of time, and we all have lives to manage outside of work. Look, this account isn't for me, but good luck. - That's okay. - Good luck. - Thanks for coming by. - Thank you. Listen, I wish you the best, but there's no way I can make it work, either. - Good luck. - It's all right. - It's all right. - Yeah. I'm out, too. I still have Christmas shopping to do an a nonrefundable ski trip planned this weekend. - That's all right. - Sorry. - Good for you. - We understand that this account is not for everyone. Thank you all for your time. Okay. That brings us down to four companies, I guess. Uh, actually three. I'm with her. Jenna Rogers and Julia Rogers from Rogers Realty. Well, nice to meet you both. Are there any more questions? Nope. - No. - All right. Okay. Well, then, we look forward to seeing you first thing, bright and early. Thanks. Not that we're kicking you out. You're all more than welcome to stay. We'll be decorating Christmas cookies in the dining room. Well, this just got a lot more complicated. Yeah. You can say that again. My daughter starts Christmas break tomorrow, so, yeah, my, uh, wife is going to kill me. Doug, Doug, why don't you let me and Julia just duke this one out? You're a family man. You know, you don't need to work during the holidays. Yeah. I hear you, Chad, but family man or not, but we all know what an account this size would mean for our careers, right. Ooh, yeah, and our wallets, too. Told you that's all he cares about. If you want to run your company like a charity, then go ahead. Be my guest. I, on the other hand, work for money, and I intend on making partner, so if you'll excuse me, I have a schedule to clear. Yeah. I should run too. Promised the wife I'd grab some dinner. Oh, grab some flowers, too. It'll help soften the blow. Ah, I like that. All right, guys. See you later. He's right, you know? - About what? - If you want this account, you have to make it your entire focus. Let me handle the business this week, and you dig in here. - What about Dad? - Dad is doing so much better. I've got this. Ugh, accept help for once in your life. Just trust me! Plus, when was the last time you took any kind of vacation? This is not a vacation. It's work. Yeah, but it could be a good chance for you to unwind a little. There will be no unwinding. You know as well as I do if I don't land it account, we're going to lose the house. I know, but I've got a good feeling about this. I can't bank on a feeling. Listen, I'll get my ducks in a row tonight, and I'll be ready to go off-grid tomorrow. Or you can get a leg up on the competition. You heard Donna! They're decorating cookies. Start right now. It'll show initiative. Jenna, I have to get packed and cancel all the appointments for this week. I have a lot to do. Just trust me. I've got this. Come on. Decorate your heart out. I know you've got some Christmas spirit deep inside there somewhere. - Let it out! - Ooh! ♪ Oh, Donna. Julia would love to stay and partake in the fun, if you don't mind. - Oh, that'd be lovely. - Awesome. She is so excited about staying. Wait. Maybe she could spend the night tonight. Sure. You're more than welcome to stay, if you'd like. Well, I, um, I... I don't have any of things with me, unfortunately, new clothes, um, but I really hate to miss out on all of this. No problem. I got you covered. We always have extra clothes. They might not be the exact fit, but they'll do the job. Great. Thank you so much, Donna. All right. You guys stay here. Have a great time. I'll go clear your schedule and get your clothes for tomorrow. Keys, please. Sure. Perfect. I hate you right now. I'll be back, but in the meantime, you need to get some Christmas spirit, and if you can't, then fake it until you make it. Okay? ♪ ♪ Here you go. I should have some pajamas somewhere. Oh. I hate to take someone's sweater. Oh, don't worry. This is from the lost and found. People leave stuff here all the time. We try to send it back, but they just don't want it. - Can you believe it? - No. I can't imagine anyone leaving this behind. Well, like I said, sometimes they just don't want it back, but it should be more comfortable. It definitely looks more comfortable and Christmasy. Thank you, just not photos, please. Promise. You can have room three on the second floor. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Hmm. ♪ Wait a minute. What is she doing? What is she wearing? ♪ I haven't decorated cookies in forever. I'm so excited. I'm so glad you could stay. - The more, the merrier. - Thanks, Donna. Ashley, I have an emergency. I need you to clear my evening. - Yeah, okay. - Actually, clear my whole week. I'm going to work remotely. Okay. You remember that Erikson farmstead deal? - Yeah, of course. - Yeah, well... So about your listing, we're a smaller company, so we can give more personalized attention to our clients. It sounds like that's what you're looking for. Oh, start in the middle and work your way out like this. I think it's a great idea, having us all stay here. I'm a big believer in treating every listing as if it were my own. Well, that's good to hear. There's so many memories in this house. It's bittersweet, you know? Where's your assistant? Oh, she's also my sister. She had to run. Our dad just finished some chemo treatments. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Are you sure you're going to have time to devote to an account this size? Yes, absolutely. I always put work first. Oh, uh, but he's actually cancer-free now. He's... He's doing a lot better. Hey! Traffic was bad, so I'm going to just wait here and decorate some cookies with you guys. Great. Do you two know each other? - Yeah. - No. We're acquainted. It's a small world, the realty business. Then this is the perfect time for you two to become friends. Chad, I think I have something more comfortable for you to wear. Meanwhile, sanitize your hands. - Yes, Donna. - Well, well, well, I underestimated you, Miss Rogers. Hmm. Well, I can't imagine you returned simply because of your love for cookie decorating. I don't know what you're talking about. I am cookie enthusiast. DIY projects are my jam. Very funny. Speaking of funny, your sweater. Oh, it's going straight to the Christmas album. - Don't you dare post that. - Yeah, no problem. I'll delete it as soon as you bow out of this listing. I'm sure you have plenty of things to do before Christmas. No, not a chance. I would rather be humiliated than give you the satisfaction. Besides, I have a better chance of getting this listing than you. You can't compete with Exclusive Realty or me. Just... just think of it this way. I'll save you a lot of time and trouble if you just go home now. Wow. Chad, um, I found some clothes for you to wear in the lost-and-found pile. I'm sure it's much more comfortable than that suit. Yeah. I can see why they were lost in the first place. I'm not sure why anyone would want to buy them. Oh, oh, oh, I was joking. Um, they're great, perfect. You know, you can stay the night, if you'd like. I can find some pajamas somewhere. Well, actually, um, I didn't bring anything with me, so I need to go home to pack for the week, but thank you for the offer. Okay. Oh, Julia, I put your pajamas up on your bed. Oh, okay. Thanks. Well, a... actually, on... On second thought, I... You know, it doesn't make any sense for me to drive all the way home and then come all the way back in the morning. I'll just have my assistant drop some things off. Well, great. I will go find those pajamas. You can stay in room four upstairs. Sounds good. Boy. Hey! Perfect picture for the Christmas album. - Hmm. - Hmm. ♪ Here is a tip. Try frosting the cookie first. Oh, yeah. I know, I know. I just wanted to break it so I could eat it. Oh. This isn't kindergarten. You're not going to get in trouble for eating the cookies. You know, cookie decorating takes a delicate touch and an eye for detail. I'm not surprised you're having difficulty with it. Oh, it's going to be like that, is it? I don't know what you're talking about. You think you have more of an eye for detail than I do.

It is impressive how the two of you run this inn. The attention to detail: I've never slept in a more comfortable bed in my life. What, wait? - You... you slept here? - I think was today. - It's a long story. - I'll fill you in later. Make sure you all have a hearty breakfast, okay, because you're going to need it. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. What's on the agenda for today? I saw something in the brochure about, uh, snowshoeing. Oh, a man who does his homework. No, but today, I thought it would be nice if we all got out there and, uh, you helped us pick out a Christmas tree. Oh, that would be fun. Where do they sell them around here? Oh, we're not going to buy a cut tree from a lot, dear. You're going to go out and find one and cut it down yourself. It'll be fun. I'm going to take one of these for the road. What did she say? - Cut down a tree? - Yeah. She said we're cutting down a tree. You know, I can't believe you two slept here. You know, a few years ago, we almost lost a portion of this woods to a building development group. Huh. You know, I vaguely remember that. Yeah? Yeah, an environmental group stepped in... - Yeah. - Because of the, um, the wolf population, right? Yes. That's quite a memory you've got. That's... that's exactly right. This, uh, forest, you know, it houses one of the largest gray wolf populations in the entire US. - Did you say wolves? - Oh, yeah. Don't worry. They rarely attack humans. Rarely?

I'm fine. I just didn't realize it was going to be this cold, okay? Plus, then if you gave me your jacket, then you'd be freezing, and where would we be? - You're stubborn. - I'm not stubborn. I'm tougher than you. Oh, so you're not stubborn. You don't want my jacket, and you know how to walk. I'm sensing a deep independent streak. - Where did that come from? - Shh! Stop talking! Do you see what's happening? - You remind me a lot of my son. - They're talking. Okay, so what? No. They're doing more than talking. They're bonding, and we're back here fighting. We're fighting? Is this us fighting? - Shh. - All right. So, Herb, how much longer to this tree? Well, jeez, I don't know, Chad. I think when we see it, - we will know. - Really? Because did you see that one? I think that one is perfect or that one or that one. You cold? No, no. I'm fine. I love the woods, super outdoorsy. My daughter, she hates the cold too, hates it. But you know what? You're right. That tree over there, that is a perfect tree. Come on. Let's do this. You're the boss. There she goes! - Oh! - All right. Oh, my gosh! That was so exhilarating! I've never cut down a Christmas tree before, and the sound it makes when it fell! It was just was like, "Boom!" Who knew to get her to smile you just had to give her a saw? Hey, I just can't believe you lived here your entire life and you never cut down your own Christmas tree. I guess I never knew what I was missing. Yeah, well, I guess not. So, Herb, what now? You know, he's cut. How do we get this big guy back? Well, Chad, we carry it back. Oh. So, uh, why don't you take the, uh, trunk. Trunk man. You and I can support the middle.

I won't even take a shower, but, uh, I'll be right back. Yeah. I need to take one, too. Jeez, how do I have 10 missed calls? Yeah, well, the reception up here in the woods is pretty spotty. Oh. They're off my wife, too, if you guys will excuse me. - I hope everything is okay. - I'm sure it's fine. I've noticed wives get a bit jumpy when their husbands are away. I didn't know you were married. No, no. I'm not. - Engaged one. - Oh, I'm... I'm sorry it didn't work out. I'm not. It was a lifetime ago. Anyways, uh, where do we find the decorations? This tree needs a pop of color. Doug, my man, we're just about to, uh, decorate the tree. - What, are you leaving? - Is everything all right? I'm afraid not, guys. My daughter, she's in the emergency room with an asthma attack. They're admitting her right now, so I definitely got to leave. - Go. - We understand. Of course. Of course. Just go. You know what I mean? You are a family man through and through, and we really respect that. I appreciate that, Herb. Hey, listen, really enjoyed our conversation earlier today too. - Me, too. - Thanks a lot, man. Chad, wish I could've stayed and duked it out, you know? May the, uh, best man or woman win. Hmm? - All right. - All right. We'll miss you, buddy. Hope your daughter gets better soon. - Thanks. - What a shame. Yeah, it is, but the good news is, I am still here. - Oh. - Yes, you and Julia. - Yeah, and... and her. - Yeah. Chad, come on. Admit it. She's not all that bad. I will admit no such thing, though she has been surprising. Well, surprises are good, right? Are we going to do this or what? Let's do this. Yes, sir. Now, you help me go get the ornaments in the cellar, and, Herb, you get the ones in the attic. Yes, dear. Let's go. Okay. I just love decorating the Christmas tree.

Nothing puts me more in the Christmas spirit than decorating the tree. - Oh. - Oh, we had a couple that stayed here that wore matching clothes. Oh, okay. Well, hopefully, my sister will be bringing my clothes soon, um, but where's Doug? Oh, Doug? Doug had a family emergency. He had to go. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah.

Look, I'm going to text him right now and tell him what I want. Enjoy. - He's quite good with the kids. - Yeah. He's full of surprises. - Aw, come on. - Funny you should say that. - Why? - Oh, nothing. Are you guys whispering about me? No because the world doesn't revolve around you. I was just saying that you're a natural with the kids. Well, I better be. I practically raised my little sisters. - How many? - Well, I am the oldest of four. I was 9 when my youngest sister, Ashley, was born. Yeah. She's my favorite. Don't tell the other two, though. My parents split up pretty soon after that, so I got pretty good at changing diapers. You've changed a diaper? Of course. I've changed many diapers. In fact, I bought my first car with babysitting money. - Babysitting, really? - Yeah. What would you have guessed? I would've pegged you as a spoiled only child. Well, no, if you believe it... - Where are you from? - Where am I from? Well, originally from Australia, but my family lives here now. Oh, your family is in the States? Yeah, mum and sisters. They stayed after my parents split, but my dad went back home to Sydney. I like the way you talk. Yeah? Well, that's just how we talk in Australia, but I'm glad you like it. Well, no tree is complete until the angel is on top. Oh, thank you. Mm-hmm. - Oh, dear. - Oh, I got you. Here. Let me help you.

Well, I can tell you firsthand that this place is pretty special. You see, my husband didn't come back from his last duty. - I'm so sorry. - Oh, no, no, no. It... it's okay, but, yeah, that first year was really hard, and I didn't know how we were going to make it through Christmas without him. Luckily, we found this haven, and it was life-changing. I mean, Donna and Herb, they took us in like part of their family and really made that Christmas special, so we come back every year now.

Julia, can I... Can I steal you for a minute? ♪ Okay. You saved the farmstead. That's a relief. Please, just find a buyer who actually cares about it this time. Chad?
