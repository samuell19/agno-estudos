Your mother was a wonderful woman. Grandpa, look, it's Prague. That's happening at home. Once upon a time or not It rained as if the gods had fought. BEAUTY IN TROUBLE Hard to fret Over innocence lost, Harder the push to clear a debt, Paid by loving whom you must. - I glance back... - Dinner's ready! ...through a hole in the fence The door handle's rusty and slow, Time's pull and mass hold you hence, And only now do I let you go. Milan, could I have a little more bass? - Thanks. - All settled then? Drank so much more than I should, Drank to no one's health at all, Of course I knew it did no good, But ever pride precedes a fall. Of course I always understood That peace within me had its place, Tranquility for which I would Travel oceans, sail beyond space. Before I flee this mortal woe I'll learn the hard way that a foe, Whether by accident or no, Can teach you all you need to know. Hey, are you coming to eat, or what? - You should be glad I'm working. - But what about the kids? - Your sick son... - He's your son too. Your son's been breathing mold for a year and you don't give a shit! You just better stop stealing cars or I'm taking the kids to my mom's. To your mom's? Go ahead! Fine. I need the bank card and the papers for some car. Now. Two weeks and you'll come crawling back. Eat. Jesus! - Are you happy now? - Shove it! Kuba... Goddammit! Fuck! See what you did? Hurry... Sit down. Where is it? Kuba, where is it? You locked her in? What else could I do? Last time she was bugging everybody. - Your mom wasn't bugging me. Hey, was she bugging you? - No. - Man, this isn't right. - So what do you suggest? You wanna listen to that crap about the seven deadly sins? - Come on, man, she was my teacher. - Your mom is up here! - I owe her. She always passed me. - She's not coming out, period. Come and help. Hey, sonny, want a beer? - And what are you going to have? - Coca- Cola. Coo- coo- coo? - Any boys felt you up yet? - What? - Shit! - How much? - 3,320. Just below the record. - Let me see it. - No way! - Hand it over! - No way! - Well, where are they? - Maybe they're pooing. Didn't I ask you not to bring him? - He's my husband. He wanted to see the kids. - Bullshit! - Should I have told him not to come? - He always butts into everything. What's so mysterious that you have to hide it from R?a? Nothing, mom. Not a thing. Tell me now if you don't want him to know. Are you serious? I asked my mother to grant me a little of her time because I needed to tell her something really important. Now we're in this stinky john like a couple of perverts. You're the one with the secrets! - Didn't I tell you to wait? - But I really have to go, - and Uncle R?a is odering beer. - Please, don't sit on the seat. ...you sense that Marcela needs you. She's calling you to take her back, to save her. She's a part of you. You are one flesh and one soul. You can't go against that. It's His will. It's the Lord's will. Get back in your hole by the time I count to three. Three. What are you doing up? Are you feeling lousy again? - I was waiting for you. - Get this: Marcela's mother- in- law is sitting outside in her car. - I know. - What does she want? Why doesn't she come up? I don't know. Kuba... It's here. Well... Zdena, what's going on? I'll explain everything, but not here. - Where am I going to sleep? - I made up the couch in the kitchen. The kitchen? And where are you going to sleep? In the tub? - In here. - In here, eh? Kuba, get in straight. They'll be here for a while. Do you mind? Don't even ask. - But I want to know your opinion. - Does it matter? You're her mother. And if you figure it's a good solution, I accept it. The boy has asthma; he can't breathe there. It's worse than they expected. I had no choice. And I accept it. I knew you would. Give me a kiss. A real one. Zdena, you're a stupid cow who lets everyone shit on you. - Do you know that? - Like some beer? I would. Does that old bag down in the car need refuge too? No, she wants me to come home. Ah, a very good evening to you. Or is it morning? How about a snack? We've got everything. Help yourself: potato chips, mushrooms... How about something chilled? A drink? We've got everything. How about a little sleepy- bye? Go right ahead. We're here to serve. Or sugar! Sugar for the kids; here you go! How long can we look forward to your company? No idea. - Go get in the tub. - Get lost. I was here first! Quiet! Hi! Stop it! Let's go! Hello. - Pato?ka. A pleasure. - Bene?. I finally meet you in the flesh. So you haven't been here since way back when? I have, but not inside. ...I'm sorry but it really doesn't matter. The court ruled that you have to move out by the 18th. And what's the date today? Mrs. Havl?kov?, you can't stop the rightful owner from doing what he wants with his property. But my mother... - I just hope you know I'm not making it up. - We believe you. But Mr. Bene? got the house back in restitution and he wants to sell it. - You're preventing him and that's against the law. - What can I do? I'm sorry. Mr. Bene?... You'd better prepare yourself. This is emotional blackmail and you shouldn't allow it. I'm sorry... I didn't know about your situation. I'm not in such a rush to sell. I'm rarely in Prague and I can stay at a hotel. May the Lord bless you, Mr. Bene?. The top floor is cleaned out and you can move right in. I can even cook for you. You can't stay at an expensive hotel when you own a house... That is, until you sell it. - That's yours. - I know. Shall we say hello to my mother? - Are you thirsty? - No. - No? - Actually, yes. Here you go... - What's this? - A Volvo... How'd you get it? It's me... You idiot, that car's got satellite security! Sorry, Jarda... He didn't want to! It's not his fault! They forced him! Please, in God's name! Let me go! Look, the flood destroyed everything! Let my son go! R?a offered to take Kuba to the speedway on Saturday. Right, R?a? Or to the technological museum? - R?a? - What? You offered to take Kuba to see those motorbikes. Sure, if he wants to go. Kuba, do you want to go to the races with R?a? Sure. Good. If it doesn't rain... You can decide then. Okay, I'm off. - Come here, Zdena. - Cut it out, you! I'll be lonely on the couch... Tonight I'll sleep with a hard- on! R?a, the kids are here! - Bye. - See ya. Not even a pig takes the last one. - Anything wrong? - A good question. Keep working. Let me put it this way: You had accommodation troubles and we provided a temporary refuge. You are our guests and we treat you as such. Hosts have certain responsibilities and we fulfill them: We share our food, home, beds, and facilities. Isn't that so? But guests also have certain responsibilities. They must respect certain rules. Let's clarify what those are. Yeah, what rules are you talking about? Don't raise your voice, okay? I'm speaking calmly. Rule one: If I'm hungry I ask my host if I can eat a certain item. - Otherwise, it's basically stealing. - You're saying we stole something? Kids, your mom apparently forgot to tell you that I'm a diabetic, so I'll explain the concept to you myself. I'm ill. Pretty seriously ill. And because of my illness, I can only eat certain things which are hard to find and expensive to buy. When you're older, you'll realize what a problem it is. For now it's enough that you respect certain rules. For example, don't scarf down all my diabetic cookies! You may eat whatever you wish as long as you first ask politely. By asking if you can have something you will avoid accidentally devouring the only fucking cookies the doctor has permitted me to eat. Is that clear? They didn't teach you at home, so I'm telling you now. It's polite to ask. Don't just grab things when your host isn't looking! Fine, we get the idea. We'll buy you some more cookies tomorrow. But what if I want them now? What if I want to eat the cookies I bought with my disability check and put in my goddamned cupboard? If they'd left any I wouldn't have said a word, but your kids ate every last diabetic cookie and I get nothing! You barge in here with no advance warning, and we don't say a thing. We simply adapt to your lifestyle. And what's the first thing you do? Like roaches, you act as if you own everything. But you are mistaken! You are not at home. You are guests! Get the difference? Okay, he's blown off steam. Now go wash. No! Don't say, ''Go wash,'' ask, ''May we go wash?'' - Do you feel the difference? - May we go wash? You may. Go on now. - That was the last time. - Great. The last time you pick on my kids, you wimp. Got a problem? Then run along back home. No one's stopping you. Hold on. You didn't quite understand. We're staying as long as we need to. And if you do anything to the kids I'll call their father to come and explain our rules. - Shut the fuck up and replace my cookies. - What? - With nuts! Hello? Yeah... No, no... The kids are getting ready for bed. Just don't give them R?a's diabetic cookies anymore. Okay... Bye. - Uncle, may I have one of these rolls? - Sure,have whatever you like. May I too? Why are you asking? I bought them fresh this morning. And may I put some butter on it? For heaven's sake, what's wrong? Why are you asking? Of course you can. - Uncle? - Yes? - May I put butter on mine too? Of course. Butter, grandma's preserves... You're at grandma's house. You don't have to ask when you want something. - Anything wrong? - Un- un. What a dork! Oh, Kuba, please! Anything wrong? No, I'm just taking care of a parking ticket. My car was stolen. - What? - My car was stolen, but they caught the thief. Mr. ?mol?k, sign here, please. That's the crook now. That's way too soft... You goddamn bastard! Thanks... But don't be so quick to judge. I was there when they arrested him. He's just some poor schmuck. The flood... The flood took all they had. The house is destroyed and they don't have money. They're desperate. His mother almost had a nervous breakdown. And now there almost like beggars. Come on in, Mrs. ?mol?kov?. That's right... - I'm Mrs. ?mol?kov?. - Bene?. - Is there a way to reach you? - Sure. Just call when you want to finish us off. May the Lord be with you, brother. Come right in. May the Lord be with you, sister. Yes, I know. All may mend their ways If their hearts are open. All may mend their ways If they seek the Lord's aid. Indeed, all may mend their ways if they seek the Lord's aid. Today, I'd like to tell you something concerning Sister Libu?e. Come up here, sister. Come right on up. Although Sister Libu?e's son had a loving mother who showed him the right path in life, Jaroslav, didn't listen and went astray. But I say it's never too late to find your way back to the gospel. Let us pray with all our hearts that Jaroslav find his way back. That our love may strengthen him on his way. That our love may be a light on his hard journey. Sister Libu?e, we are with you at this difficult time in your life. We promise to help Sister Libu?e with her trials. We are her true family and we will not turn from her. Let us now pray for Sister Libu?e. Pray for salvation for her poor lost son. All may mend their ways If their hearts are open. All may mend their ways If they seek the Lord's aid. Here's what you should do: First off, not a word to the kids. Enroll them in the local school and tell them it's too far to drive all that way every day. I know the principal; it'll be no problem. In short: get them away from him. Second, file for divorce right away. Hold on, Zdena. You can't just dictate to Marcela like this. It's her family and she should decide what to do. - I hope you're not thinking of going back. - What about the kids? I don't know... Tell them their dad's working abroad. You have to stay here to protect them from the situation. Then he won't have the slightest influence over them. But, Zdena, he's their father. Father, huh? Good lord! Is that how a father behaves? His actions will follow them: Father's employment: thief. Education: maximum security. That's just great. - Show a little consideration. - What are you playing at? You just don't want them around, but that's just too bad, buster. This is their home. It always was and always will be while I'm around. Sorry, Zdena, but allow me to contradict you. Marcela and the kids have a home elsewhere. It's different now because they're having a hard time. We're all they've got now. And we're going to help them out. They'll stay until the court awards a settlement and they can take care of themselves. That's final. - Someone's at the door. - I'll get it. - Sorry to come by so late. - It doesn't matter... R?a and I knew from the start that Jarda was a loser and a crook. Good evening. Have a seat, Mrs. ?mol?kov?. Like some tea or coffee? - No, don't trouble yourself. - Oh, but it's no trouble at all. Marcela, you can't leave him now. He'll die without you. Everything he did, he did because of you. He's sorry. He really needs you and the kids. - That's what I think. - He needs them, huh? You should at least write him... Don't drink so much... Tell him you stand by him. And go see him when you can. She won't go anywhere or write anything. Your son ruined my daughter's life, and he's stigmatized her kids. - May he burn in hell. - Zdena! - Burn in hell? That's neither up to you nor me. All we need to know is that it's never too late to repent. - Seems pretty late to me. - Right... I get your drift. You go visit him. You're that crook's mother. Zdena, let me say this: Fifteen years ago your daughter was in a bind. She was three months pregnant and had left a home where they were trying to get her to kill her unborn child. And my son, a crook you call him, an unprincipled criminal, accepted her into his home without hesitation. Then he married her and adopted her child. He has loved her for fifteen years, and fed and clothed her and her two kids. - Now he is in need. - Who are you trying to pin your guilt on? We shouldn't forget that. Forgive me... I'm sorry... Mom? - Want to see the kids? - Yes. I'm not here. What would you like? I don't know... - Do you like wine? - Yes, but not if it's sour. The flood... must have been... The water came up to here, right? Right here? I don't know. I don't come here. But it was horribIe. It wiped us out. We weren't insured. The house wasn't. And we're paying a mortgage so we're pretty bad off... But, anyway, I apologize for my husband. I'm really sorry. That's not necessary... Does he have a lawyer? - A public defender. - I have a good lawyer. - We can't afford it. - Well, we could work it out... - What would you like to eat? - Are we eating? - Why not? - You can decide. - Do you like sushi? - I don't know. But I could try it. - It's... pretty fun. Let's get some. Oh, god... Rock, paper, scissors, now! That's enough. What? - It's great. - Really? It's good? It's called a toadstool. It's sweet. - I like it. It's better with red. - Really? - So you live in Italy? - Can I try it? - Sure. - I don't know... Yes, in Tuscany. - For how long? I joined my family there in 1967. I don't get it. Are you Italian? No, but my parents emigrated to the West in 1956. - They didn't let me out for eleven years. - Terrible. My parents thought the Red Cross could help, but it didn't work. I never saw my father again. He died, and my mother remarried. In the end, I inherited a big farm and vineyard in Tuscany. - Didn't you miss home? - No... Oh yeah, chicken paprika! - I can make that. - Really? - I'm great at it. I'm not such a great cook, but I can make that. I hope you enjoy it. What a pretty color of green... - I'm sorry... Forgive me... That's wasabi. - What is it? - It's for dipping... - Got a handkerchief? - Pardon me. - I apologize. This is your first time. It'll be better next time. - Uncle? - What? - Can I come in? - What? - Can I come in? - Sure, no problem. - You wanted to look, right? - At what? What do you think? You've never seen a man, have you? He said that? What a mega- dork! He's so gross. I'm your slimy uncle, little girl, and I want to show you my dingdong. - Yuck, you're so slimy! - I'm your slimy uncle and I want to show you my jester! Cut it out. And how about my breakfast farts? Know what? I think he hates us. Know what? I think he wants to murder us in our sleep. How am I gonna sleep now? Imagine being asleep with him wagging his slimy dingdong over you. I wanna get out of here. We better do him in before he does us. - Do you go to Italy? - All the time. We fly to Rome, Florence, Milan... I mean, of course, the travel agency I work for. I meant if you yourself have been. My last vacation was to the Canary Islands two years ago. - That's nice. - Nowhere else. It's pretty where I live. I took the liberty of bringing you a book about the region. Have a look. Our vineyard is in there, too. And here's my card in case you have any more trouble. - You're so nice. - Come on... - You really are so nice. - Why? It's nothing. After what happened no one else would even talk to me. Or they'd just tell me to piss off. - But you buy me coffee and dinner. - Actually, I'd like to thank you. It's lovely that you came. Sorry, I'm babbling. I guess I'm a little tipsy so I'm babbling. I'm sorry... I had a nice time, but I should go. We're staying with my mom, and R?a is watching the kids. He's a real idiot; I shouldn't leave them so long. Of course. Well, maybe a boat will come by. Yeah? Okay, I'll take a boat. Hi. - Did anything happen? - Where've you been? You've got two kids, and a husband in jail. I know that. Go blow yourself. What does your dad write from India? What does he write? Hi, Kuba and Lucina, how are you doing? What are you doing? I hope you're not... be... ...being naughty, and that you're getting all A's. I've just been trying to get used to things here. It's really hot and really dirty. Now you read. Here they use bikes as taxis and they call them rickshaws. Now read here. And they... have... really cheap bikes here. And I was thinking how Kuba... doesn't... have a bike. - And I... - What about that? - They got cheap bikes. - And you don't have a bike. Well, I guess... I guess dad's bringing you a bike. Doesn't he write about elephants or something? - I saw... four elephants. - And two monkeys. And two monkeys. - And here... - PS... There's no... - phone... - phone signal, so I can't call. - I guess he won't be calling. - Mom? - Where were you anyway? - I met a friend. - Who? An old acquaintance. Even mothers have friends. - And where'd you get the book? - Are you interrogating me? - It's from my friend. - Did you look inside? - No. Well, have a look. Money, money, money! - Am I interrupting anything? - Not at all. Like some coffee? No... I just brought this back. - I can't accept it. - Why? Because it's too weird. I can't accept it. I'm sorry if I offended you. I apologize. - You didn't, but I just can't accept it. - Well, okay... - I have to go. - Wait... Give it to your mother- in- law. - Really? You don't even know her. - I do. I saw how desperate she was. She'll know what to do with it. Okay, I'll be sure to give it to her. Now I gotta go. Wait. I have a proposal to make. I'm returning to Italy tomorrow. Here's the key. It's to the apartment upstairs. It'll be completely empty until I sell it. - Want me to water your plants? - No, there aren't any. - I thought you could live there. - That's ridiculous. - Why? Think about it: you need a place to live, you're getting divorced, it's bad at your mom's place... And I've got an empty flat and I'm never here. Why is that ridiculous? You're just a dream, right? The look on your face suggests the opposite. Uncle, watch out! - You don't like me much, do you? - Me? - Yeah. I bet you and your sister even hate me. - It's not true. - It is. That's how it is. Kuba, is it okay for people to lie? For them not to tell the truth? - No. - That's what I think. I think people should tell the truth no matter how much it hurts. What do you think? - Okay... Not much. - Not much what? My sister and I don't like you much. I appreciate your honesty. - May I ask why? - Because you don't like us or our mom. Know why? Because your mom lies. She hides the truth from you. She does not! - As you wish. - Why would my mom lie to us? She's afraid to tell you the truth. Like about where she is right now. Now? She's at work. You think? - What if she isn't? - Where would she be? With your dad. But my dad's in India working on a pipeline! Didn't you ever wonder why his letters don't have stamps? I mean don't have foreign stamps, Indian stamps. Your dad didn't write those letters. Who did? Your mom. Why? She doesn't want to tell you the truth about your father. We tell each other everything, for your info. I see... We tell each other everything. Even that your dad's in prison for stealing cars? That's a lie! My dad's not a thief, he's a mechanic. In this country, my boy, that amounts to the same thing. Take a lesson: Never hope for someone's death because you never know when you might need him... to save your life. Like I am right now. Want to rewind it to the beginning? - Hi, honey. - Hi. - Any letters from India? - India? Mom, I know dad's in prison. - Who told you that? - Uncle R?a told Kuba. What should he have said? Kuba thought it was odd that the letters had Czech stamps. Should he have lied? R?a was right: you should have told the kids. My god, you said we shouldn't! - Don't blame me for something I never said. - You said it, mom. Mom, you've totally lost it. You believe whatever that asshole says. You know what? It's over, and that's sad. Don't talk about him like that. You of all people have no right. Who tutored you for exams before you dropped out? R?a! R?a always cared about you. Then one fine day you just took off. Because the two of you had decided that I was having an abortion. For god's sake, you were 17 and still in school! So what? That wasn't the reason. He just didn't want any trouble. And he hated the idea of you paying attention to anyone else. Oh, no! R?a never agreed with the abortion. R?a always argued with me about it. I knew it would mess up your life. And the truth is it messed it up pretty damn good. Mom, your truths aren't worth shit. But if you like I'll go tell Lucina how much her grandmother looked forward to her birth. Should I go tell her? It's the truth! Or I can tell you the truth about how R?a, that jerk- off, tutored me, about how he helped me with exams. I can supply you with details, but I bet you're not interested. So just kindly stop using the word truth around me, okay? He's not well. You're right, but that parasite will outlive us all. In order to stave off decay, we've divided up household chores. Some of us do them without fail: I dust, sweep, and go shopping. Grandma cooks and makes you snacks. All you have to do is occasionally take out the trash. And this is the result. So now I'd like to share with you a little of the ozone grandma and I have to breathe, and the flies we have to endure. My god... You asshole! - Mom! - What are you doing? - Mom, can you come in here? Come have a look. Come in here! Do you see this? Do you? - What's going on? Did you trip? - Yeah. Mom! You had to wake me up for this? God, do you see this? Don't clean it up! - Kuba, you threw away your roll? - Don't touch it, Kuba! It's got to be cleaned up. Come on, Lucina. No big deal, and it's done. Those are my kids. - Oh, hello... - Morning. I tried to call you last night but your phone was turned off. No, I was in Italy. It's fine... So, you're here... Is everything okay? Sorry, I just got here... What time is it? I guess it's still time to sleep. The kids are fine there. I'll lie down in the next room. Would you like some tea or coffee or anything? I'll finish up in the bathroom then put some water on. - Good morning. - Good morning. Sorry for just barging in like this. - I saw your car. - Is there anything wrong? - And you have a guest... - I feel ridiculous; I'm sorry... - Don't apologize... - Morning. - Hi, I'm Bene?. - ?mol?kov?. Not there, Kuba! - Sorry... - Hi! In here, but hurry! I came to say that my mother just died. - My sincerest condolences. - Sincerest condolences. - Come in... - Hello. Let me introduce my brother... Mr. Bene?, the owner of the house. - Havl?k. - My sincerest condolences. - Mrs... Bene?ov?? - No, ?mol?kov?. My condolences. We just came to ask if your sister needed anything. And don't worry about moving. There's time for you to get everything ready. You are so very kind, Mr. Bene?. So very kind. Hold onto him, young lady. He's an angel. I always loved cars, every boy does. These days I'm more interested in safety, but when I was young I dreamed of having a Ferrari. It was so expensive. And now I'm too old, and it's a little too dangerous. It's for young guys: hockey players, soccer players... When you drive 300 km/h it's all you can do to just stay on the road. You have to lie down in a car like that. And the acceleration is so fast you start praying you'll survive. - I think your mom wants to sleep.Goodnight. - Goodnight. I suppose you are immensely grateful to Mr. Bene?. All of us are grateful, especially the kids. Italy is a civilized country founded on centuries- long traditions. Just imagining places like Rome, Venice, the Vatican... - What do you think, mom? - I don't know... Won't you be in Mr. Bene?'s way? It's just for a couple weeks, and we haven't been anywhere in so long. - Exactly! - What about the kids? - They're the most excited of all. - Yes, they really are. They'll get to know the world. They won't be troglodytes like us, with our heads warped by Russian. We're washed up but they have a chance. Oh, my... Now that's... This is right up our alley, eh, Zdena? This is really something... What a spread! I already miss them. Sorry, Mr. Bene?, but they're all I have. I understand... I'm Ev?en, by the way. Great! Let's cut the formalities. I'm R?a. - I'm Zdena... - Delighted. Enjoy the meal. - Yes, indeed. - It smells wonderful and looks fabulous. I must admit you really know how to pick a pub. This place is rife with history. But we can't afford such things, so we're all the more grateful for the invitation. - The view from here is lovely. - A view is a matter of perspective. Paying 50 crowns for a beer can ruin the view. - How long have you lived in Italy? - Thirty- seven years. You weren't even born! You ought to kiss your mother's hand every day for leaving here. I'll go choose some wine. Shit, Zdena, will you stop moping? I miss them! I'm so wretched and forlorn! Who will I talk to! - You're going to see them again. - My god, can't you see? - What? What am I supposed to see? - He's an old man! - Mom! - He could be your father. - But he's not. - Stick to him like glue. He's loaded. I'm not marrying him. We're just friends. Yeah, right. They call it being fuck buddies. Shut your fucking mouth! No one asked you. You only want them gone. All you care about is yourself. - Drop it! - That's all! - Drop it already! - You just want them gone. Man, what is this? It looks like snail shit. I bet it cost a mint, but I'm not paying for it. It wouldn't matter if I barfed! Zdena was just saying she's never been to Italy. I was wondering if we could come visit sometime. Of course, no problem. I have a guest house so there's really no problem. Hear that? Not a room, but a whole house! - Who will sample the wine? - I will. Actually, I'd prefer a beer. Wine is a bit... - Of course. - Excuse me a moment. - It's not bad. - Excuse me a moment too. You okay, mom? Is it the spaghetti? No, nothing's wrong. - R?a's right, I'm an idiot. - Who cares about R?a? Just tell me straight: Is he good to you? Yes, he's good to me and the kids too. I was just worried he's taking advantage of you. I don't want you to end up under a bridge somewhere. Mom, open your eyes. He's a decent person. Yeah, and he's really good looking. But he's as old as me. He's going to die on you. Don't be morbid. Are you planning on dying? - Does he love you? - I hope so. - Wait! Do you love him? He makes me happy, and it's a chance for me and the kids. My little redhead... You better go back. The beer's strong, and R?a talks too much when he drinks. Mom, don't worry... It's nice being with you in the bathroom again. You know, I feel sorry for Jarda. I really do! Beauty in trouble flees to the good angel On whom she can rely To pay her cab- fare, run a steaming bath, Poultice her bruised eye; Will not at first, whether for shame or caution, Her difficulty disclose; Until he draws a cheque book from his plumage, Asking her how much she owes; Breakfast in bed: coffee and marmalade, Toast, eggs, orange- juice, After a long, sound sleep... The first since when? And no word of abuse. Loves him less only than her saint- like mother, Promises to repay His loans and most seraphic thoughtfulness A million- fold one day... Where's Marcela? Yep, she went for the money. It's obvious. - Let's go. It isn't worth it. - Zdena? What's a criminal doing in our home? Please, just go back in the other room. You didn't understand. I don't want you letting criminals in our house. You talking about me? Calm down, Jarda. We have to expect it. Did you invite them? - In that case I'm calling the police - Just wait. They're going anyway. Invited guests are welcome. Invited guests! Tell Marcela she'll be sorry if she doesn't come back home. Threats to boot! That's great! She filed for divorced. She'll see you only if her lawyer is present. But we're family. Marcela can't just cart his kids off to the West. Comrade teacher, how many kids did you brainwash with your communist crap before allowing those salvation charlatans to thoroughly soak you? I'm glad you've got no influence over our grandkids! Who'd have guessed that Marcela would finally make a good decision? You are a poor man, Mr. Hrstka. All the love in you has died. There's not a drop left. But you feed on love. You suck it out of other people. You eat it, you consume it. But you are unable to give it. You're like... You're like... Like mistletoe... Or like a fungus... Or... I don't know. - I feel truly sorry for you. - What's she mumbling about? Come, Jarda. Let's just go. Finally Marcela found a decent, well- to- do man - to provide for her and her kids. - Jarda, don't let him provoke you! Let him alone. You already told him good. I didn't tell him this: This country will finally be healthy when his kind are rotting in jail. - Touch me and you're back in the slammer! - Don't listen to him! Did you see that? He wanted to attack me in my own home! Why did you let him in, you cow? Search his pockets before he goes! You never know. - You've had it! - You fucking fish cunt! Please, Jarda, don't! Let's go! I know a gal and she's got the dough, She's got the dough and her daddy loves her so! You really gave it to him! Good, good... Good. What a waste. It's for the dead. - Like I said, a waste. - Not for some. Try it. Can I? - Well? - Let me see. I don't have any rum, I mean Coke... - Neither of them. - It could use a little. - How long will you be in Prague? - Just three days. If you need anything, Rina will help you. We'll manage. We can go to Siena when I get back. - Mom? - Yeah? Dad texted us that he misses us terrible. Well... We can call him later. Come on, that's ridiculous. I don't get it. The problem is that in order not to lose the house, your father transferred lot no. 663, the front yard, to the gardening association. Then your family rented the land back from the gardening association. But no one paid the rent after 1956, so restitution didn't apply to the front yard. So they bought the front yard and the drive up to the garage. - Yes. - And you didn't know about it? - No. - Are you sure? - We didn't know. - So it comes as a complete surprise? - Unfortunately. - What will they do with it? - Well... - They're trying to steal the house again! - No! - You've got the house and the backyard. - Yes, but no access. Mr. Havl?k and his sister own the access to the garage. When did they buy it? - They obtained the deed last week. - Of course... You can get to the house through the backyard. But of course there's a cliff. And you can get to the garage... Via helicopter. - What matters is how much they're selling it for. - Exactly. Well, let's go. Okay, then, how much will you sell it for? 200,000. 200,000... I'll have to think about it. Euros. What? - 200,000 euros... That's almost6,000,000 crowns. - Yes. - It this a joke? - Does it look like we're joking? What good will it do you? What will you do with it? - We're going to vacation here. - What? - We'll vacation here, right? - Help yourself. - No, thanks. Maybe we should... first discuss how much Mr. Bene? would agree to. Of course, but I won't take less than 6,000,000 crowns. Mr. Bene? has been so very kind. We could give him a discount. Don't interfere sister. Mr. Bene?, you want to sell the house anyway. Well, then, why not sell it to... Mr. Havl?k at a reasonable price. - Sure. - Are you crazy? - Me? I'm just looking for a solution. Mr. Bene?... - We'll put a barbeque here. - Yeah. I can hardly wait. I warned you, remember that. If you still value my opinion, sell it. Your troubles will be over. Just think about the risks involved in reconstruction and all that. You live someplace else and you're doing well. You wanted to sell it, so why complicate things. Zdena? Are you asleep? You're right... I love this. This is what I call living. Take it easy... Screw everything... Climb into bed in broad daylight... You want me to beg, huh? My god! Oh, my god! Zdena! Oh my god... Zdena! Oh my god... Uncle R?a's coming! - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Sincerest condolences. - Thanks. - So you came... - Yes. I guess you're doing well. Your mom would never say it, but she missed you terribly. She really, really missed you. - Do they really know it's our grandma? - For sure. Is that all? We have to go talk to him, for the kids' sake. Go ahead. I have a meeting at the hotel anyway. OK. Come on. Grandma! - Hi, Kuba. - We have only one grandma now. I was scared I wouldn't see the kids again. Daddy, how was jail? Well... - It was normal. - Were you scared? - You bet I was scared. Every day. - Of what? That I'd never see you again. I was scared for you too. - Did they hit you? - No, not at all. - Where are you staying? - At a hotel. That's terrible! A hotel? My Lord! - Hungry, kids? - We're going to eat at a pub. - I made fried chicken. - Yum! I understand if you don't want to come. We'll understand. We know it's short notice. I wanted to say... I agree to the divorce; I won't cause trouble. He's learned about consequences. He doesn't want to lose the kids. - Daddy? - Yeah? - How does an eternal flame work? How else? Aha! Gas. See, I told you. Maybe I'd like some chicken. - Hey, want some chicken? - Sure. Okay. ?ar?da! Hi. Come here, ?ar?da! I was wondering if you wanted to take some things. - You've really done a lot. - There's still so much to do. I can only work on the house on weekends. - Have you found a job? - I'm fixing up cool old cars. - Want a cig? - I quit. - What a shocker! For a long time I thought you'd come back. I wanted you to have a place to come back to. Hey, gimme one of those. - I want you to know that if anything happens... - Like what? I don't know, but if anything happens you can come home. Mom's got some pictures and books upstairs. Wanna have a look? I could send them to you. - That's nice of you. - No, it isn't... It's just that I love you and I want you to know it. No other woman interests me or turns me on. I knew you'd come crawling. Don't tell me you're any good together. Kuba, Lucina, come inside! Hurry up! He's worked so hard here... Look how good it is here for Marcela. Right, kids? Mom? - Mom, can we take ?ar?da with us? - No. I'll transfer the money within 3 days... after you sign the agreement. Your 4,000,000 crowns can be there by Friday. Given the situation, I really think it's the best solution. Hold your tongue, Mr. Pato?ka. Just keep your opinions to yourself. And you can forget about your fee. This is outrageous; I won't be cheated! Fine, and now for you. Understand this, Mr. Havl?k: I will never sell my house to you or anyone related to you, whether through blood or business. Unlike you, I don't need the house. I don't need to live in it. I don't need to sell it. I couldn't care less if it gets run down, loses value, or collapses. You acquired the land for purposes of extortion. Sell it to me for the purchase price or you'll be grilling wienies by my garage door till you die. And you and your sister better be out by tomorrow. Is that clear? Hi. - Hi... - Hi. - I'm here... I've got the card. - Hi. - How was it? - Fine, fine... What happened? Do you want to talk about it? Wait here, kids. Order a cola. We'll be right back. I'll be back in a minute. What happened? Did you sleep with him? Are you going back to him? No. I invited R?a to Italy. My god... Why are you so nice? - Please. - Prego. - Thank you. - Grazie. - Waiter, the check, please. - Il conto, per favore. Kuba, Lucina, let's go! Let's get packed.
