Catch her! Don't let her escape! Is somebody there! Help me! Catch her! Help! Catch her! Come. Come. We rule this place. Come. I don't know, sir. I don't know where that girl ran away. I don't know, sir. Look Shano, don't do this drama. Speak up. Where is the girl? Don't be afraid. Did you have something to eat? Now, say. I don't know, sir. - If you speak up, then you'll survive. I'm telling the truth, sir. I didn't help her in escaping. God promise. So you won't say! You won't say! Greetings, Baburao-ji. How are you? - Fine. I'd told you about them in the morning. They live in Mumbai. - Greetings. They're very rich. They've come to buy a girl. Hey, give him his money. And a bit to me too. Hey, Kancha. Come here. There. Stand properly. Come and have a look.

Forgive me! 6 o'clock a.m. 6 o'clock a.m. 6 o'clock a.m. What is this, granny? You scared me. I didn't scare you. I woke you up. I have to play new tricks to wake you up everyday. Come on, get ready quickly. You have to go for a jog. Sapna has already called 4 times. She's waiting for you. Oh, granny. You're so sweet! Enough of flattering. Now hurry up. Come on. Okay. - Good girl. Listen I've told you so many times not to give a penny.. ..to Pooja's father from the office money. He splurges the money in gambling and drinking. Where is he right now? Why did you take such a long time in opening the door? Is every person sleeping here? No one is in their senses. Where have you splurged the money that you took from the office? Even you splurge so much. Beauty parlour.. kitty party. Have I asked you to give account for that? Who are you to ask for the accounts? It's all my father's money. I'm not your father's servant. I'm your husband. If henceforth you ever dare to talk to me like this.. ..then I'll not spare you. Understood! What's the matter, Sapna? Hi, Sapna. Hi, Pooja. - Hi, Kailash. God knows what has happened to her. Since morning she is so dejected. I can't understand anything. What's the matter, Sapna? - Brother knows about our love. And he wants to get me married to someone else. Oh my God! But how can we solve this problem? My friend can help us solve this problem. But who is this person? - Chandar. Shut up! "There is talk.." Thank you, child! "There is talk.." "There are talks about us.." "On the streets, beloved.." "There are talks about us on the streets, beloved.." "We are faltering, crazy people, our steps are faltering.." "We don't care about anything, we are carefree.." "There are talks about us on the streets, beloved.." "There are talks about us on the streets, beloved.." Stop it! What do you guys think of yourselves! What do you know about music! You don't know anything about tunes and rhythm! You don't know about heart and heartbeats! You just shake your bodies like a madman! You don't have any strength in your hands and legs! We're no less than anybody! Hey, boss.. this fellow just insulted us. Hey, what are you droning about boss! Tell your boss, if he is a true man.. then play this thing. Boss, our reputation is at stake. Play this thing. Look at him. He's holding the instrument as if it is some dead snake. "You start it.." "You start it.." "You start playing the song of love.." "You start playing the song of love.." "Listening to which this heart sways.." "Listening to which this heart sways, lover become crazy.." "We lovers become crazy.." "You start playing the song of love.." "You start playing the song of love.." "A beautiful girl will come into my dreams one day.." "She will talk coyly, she will steal my sleep.." "She will torment she will make me yearn.." "She will give me some pain.." "She will smilingly torture us.." "You start it.." "You start it.." "You start playing the song of love.." "You start playing the song of love.." "Listening to which this heart sways.." "Listening to which this heart sways, lover become crazy.." "We lovers become crazy.." "You start playing the song of love.." "You start playing the song of love.." Hey, who is it? Brother. Sapna, go and sit in the car. - But, brother.. I said go and sit in the car! Hi! What fun! This is Bruce Lee! This is Jackie Chan! This is Shahrukh Khan! This is Salman Khan! What was this? Dharmendra. I don't want to play with you. You punch me so badly like Dharmendra. Sorry. - No, sorry. If you want to apologize, then give me 100 rupees. Take this. Is it okay? - Okay. Okay. - Chandar. At this age only you need men! Brother, I love Kailash. And I want to marry him. I'll take decisions of your life! Understood? Yes. This task is so difficult. It is very risky. Yes. Her brother is an inspector. But he was suspended. It means without throwing the weight of him.. ..being in the police, he thrashed Kailash badly. Hang on. I have.. thank you. I have a superb plan. Let Sapna marry. What are you saying! - Listen to me. There is a Sapna who lives in my building. We'll fix her up with him. So Kailash will have Sapna. And we won't have to do anything too. Great! Superb! Hang on. Hang on. We'll abduct Sapna. What! - You're mad! Listen. Tomorrow is my sister's wedding. That guy will surely make the mistake of coming here. Break that rascal's hands and legs. And I'll handle everything later. Chandar, there is tension here. - Tension? Yes. That inspector has hired goons. Hey, where are you going? - Hey, go upstairs. Look Pooja. Go and explain to Sapna. Tell her to marry the guy whom I've chosen for her. If she refused, then the consequence will be bad. You understood what you have to do? - Yes. All the best. - Okay. Sapna, what will you do? - I don't know. Rascal! If you are a true man, then stay there. Yes. I'm a true man. You just come down. I won't spare you. Rascal! Catch them! Come. Come. Come on, let's go. Stop! Stop.. Who is Sapna? Who is Sapna? - She. I'm Sapna. - Come on, hurry up. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Let's go. - Come. Oh no! Come on. Run! I said run! Come on! Duck! Pooja, hurry up! Let's run! You! You hit a girl! Sorry, sir. Sorry! Sorry.. Are you okay? Are you okay! - Yeah. Then, come on. Come on, let's run! - Come. No, Chandar. He is my brother. Let's go from here. Chandar, let's go. - Please, let's go. Come on, hurry up. Welcome. Welcome. Congratulations, Kailash. Bathroom is over there. I'm welcoming them. - What is this? Give an offering of 500 rupees only then you can enter the house. 500? - Yes. This is women's duty. But no problem. Now say. I can do anything for 500 rupees, even be a woman. Give me 500 rupees. 500 rupees is nothing. Take 1000 rupees. May your pair always be protected! May God give you a long life! Hey, Kamala.. He has brought the police along with him. Don't worry. Relax. Brother, I married him with my own will. Don't create a scene here. And don't try to ruin our happiness. Don't think that the story is over. Henceforth be cautious from me. The day I get a hold on you.. I'll kill you. Best of luck. Inspector sir. Look, my pant is lying outside your house. Dry clean it and send it to me. I'm wearing a loincloth. Does it look good? You! - Sir, no! Sir, no! Sir, no! - Leave me! Did I say something wrong? Did you like our arrangement? - It's great. Isn't it nice? - Hey, what are you doing? Get out. Come, Kailash. You too come with us. Hey, where are you taking him? You all leave. You too come. - Yes, we're leaving. Come.. Okay, Kailash. I wish you all the best. And take care of yourself. Okay. - Thank you very much. Chandar. Thanks for everything. Hey, don't be emotional. Okay. I wish you a happy married life. Take care. Take care. Jasbeer. - Yes, Chandar. Listen. You take 4 of them with you in the car. - Okay. And for the rest.. take this. Leave them in a cab. Okay. - Bye, Chandar. Take care. - Bye. See you. Bye. - Bye. Excuse me, can you please drop me home? Yes, he'll drop you. But I don't know her address. She must be residing near your home. Ask somebody on the road for the address. You go and sit in the car. Thanks. Where have you got me stuck! - I've given you a chance. Stop the car in some isolated spot. - Shut up. Aren't you ashamed to say such things? Alert! Be alert! To contact you.. My contact number is 6392848. - 6392871. 48.. - Alert! 48, buddy. I'm sick of his habit of forgetting. So where do you live? GM road. I mean.. MG road. Bungalow no 27. - Okay. Do you mind if I play some music? - No. We've reached my house. Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. My name is Pooja. Nice meeting you. I want to.. - Okay, bye. Bye. Hey! Wait! I've got it for you! Wait! I've got your favourite biscuits. Take this. Eat it. Well done, buddy. How is dad's mood? Tell me. How is it? Where are you going? Answer me. A red cap. Meaning dad is angry. Oh my God! Now how will I go inside my house? Hey! Where are you going? What are you digging? Hey! Rocky! Well done, buddy! Well done! Dad! You! - Yes, your father. You're a thief. And your buddy dog is also a thief. You'll get one spanking. And he will get 2. One.. two.. get lost. Like Shammi Kapoor of 'Dil tera diwana'.. ..you were secretly entering your house. And you thought that I'll not come to know? Dad, I'm famished. Please give me chicken or mutton. Forget meals! I'll not spare you! - But, dad. Shut up! First with your friends' help.. ..you abduct a suspended inspector's sister. Then you get her married with her lover. Am I a lawyer or you! You should have told me. I would have lawfully solved everything. Hang on! Hang on! - What happened? When you're serious, you look just like Dilip Kumar. "Our eyes met." Really? - Correct. But I want to ask you.. With those worry lines on your forehead.. ..you look just like Raj Kappor. Like in 'Sangam'. - No, 'Shri 420'. My son. How many bottles of alcohol have you drunk? One? - Dozen. What one dozen! Are you mad! Go and take a bath! Go! "There is no lover like you.." "You are the identity of love.." "I see love in your eyes, I see you as a lover, a beloved.." "I see love in your eyes, I see you as a lover, a beloved.." "O my beloved, I swear on your love.." "O my beloved, I swear on your love, I see a friend who could die for love.." "I see love in your eyes, I see an innocent acceptance.." "Now I wish I remain lost, I keep sleeping in your arms.." "I too feel like straightening your entangled hair.." "..and keep drowning in those blue eyes.." "Let there be no more distances between us.." "There is peace in restlessness too.." "I see an innocent acceptance.." "I see love in your eyes, I see you as a lover, a beloved.." "O my beloved, I swear on your love.." "O my beloved, I swear on your love.." "I see a friend who could die for love.." "I see love in your eyes, I see you as a lover, a beloved.." 6392848. Should I eat apple or banana? Apple or banana? Hello. Hello.. hello.. hello.. God knows who it is! What happened, dad! You disconnected the call! Who was she? Aren't you ashamed to talk to your dad like this? Dad, we're cooperative kids of Navjeen co-operative housing society. Shall we find a girlfriend for you? Shut up! It's a sin to think about this! Fool! Idiots! "It is my first love." Hello. Hello.. Hello.. Hello. Who? - I. Who I? I meaning I. - Whom do you want? Chandu. - Sorry, wrong number. There is no Chandu here. My name is Chandar. I know. But I like Chandu. And I'll call you Chandu only. But who are you? Dream girl. Dream girl? Yes. Dream girl. Strange. I don't even know you. But I know everything about you. Your name is Chandar Kapoor. Your father's name is Dilip Dev Kapoor. He is an advocate, civil and criminal. Your height is 5'11. And your weight is 72 kgs. Correct? Yes. Correct. - Hey, Chandu. Why are you scratching your head? A beautiful young girl is talking to you. Talk romantically. Like darling, let's go to Juhu beach. Let's go for coffee. Will you come to Khandala? Hey, what are you saying! I'm talking about my heart. - Pooja! Oh my God! Daddy. Chandu, okay.. bye. Hello.. Who is this dream girl? - I don't know. But I can find out. Give me 2000 rupees. Close your eyes. - Yes. This was 1000 on one cheek. And 1000 more on the other cheek. No! No! - Where are you running! Here, sir. One more card for 2000. Don't take the cards. First keep the money. Yes, I'll give you. First play the game. You don't have money and you're playing. Now show. - Here. 5, 6, 7. Stop! Ace, 3, 2. Oh shit! What about the money? I'll pay you later. - Sit! Did you fill in the petrol? - No, I filled it with oil. What rubbish! - Take your old car away from here! Chandar. Hey. Hey, quickly fill in the petrol. How many litres, sir? When did you open this pump? No, I lost 2000 rupees in gambling with a petrol pump owner. And he has told me to work here to pay off the debts. How many times I've told you not to gamble. Even Pandavas had lost Draupati in gambling. Today I've lost. But tomorrow I'll win. Yes, I'll fill in. Everyday you quarrel. He won't reform. Hello, Jai speaking. - Hello, give the phone to Chandar. You don't want to talk to Jai. - Hey, cockroach. Quickly give the phone to Chandar. - Yes. Hey Chandar... A call for you. - For me? Yes. Some girl.. who calls you cockroach. Hello. Hi, Chandu. You? - Yes. Sweetheart. You're filling petrol? Yes. But without petrol, you've set my heart ablaze.. ..and even the ocean can't douse it. Hey, don't you have any other work? Yes. To bring you closer to me. To make you mine. What do you mean? I mean.. wherever you go, my shadow will be with you. What? - You're body, I'm the shadow. Don't believe me? Look on the ground. Oh, my Chandu. You can't find me so easily. Bye. Who was she? - I don't know. For God's sake, give me something. Here, take 100 rupees. Don't ever give me 100 rupees, dear. - Why? Even I used to give 100 rupees as alms. Now look what condition I am in. Does anybody speak the truth in today's world? Fool! You're a beggar. And you'll die as a beggar. You will get a tail. What is this? - Soda. Where is the bottle? - In that room. Where is the bottle! You spoilt my mood! Is this a house or hell! Nobody cares for me! And what do you care for? Only your alcohol. In spite of being the managing director of the company.. ..you didn't come for the meeting. All the members were asking why your husband hasn't come. I was humiliated. So you don't regret my not coming for the meeting. You regret somebody asking why have I come. I spite my fate for giving me such a husband. You're my husband just for namesake. You are as good as not being there. What did you say! What did you say! What are you doing! Get lost! The match is beginning. Here is the first ball. Chandar, throw the ball quickly. Chandar, throw the ball fast. - What are you doing? Here comes the son.. and he threw the ball. Out! Out.. - No! No! No.. - Out! Ask the umpire. Say out for LBW. I'll not spare you if you give out. If you don't give LBW, then I'll stop your quota of milk and bread. And if you out me, then I'll throw you out of the house. Look at this, match fixing has started on the streets too. Dear, for my sake, give me one more chance. - No.. No, no dad. Don't make me emotional. Okay. Okay. - Last chance. Okay. Second last chance. - Dad! Okay, last chance. Let's continue. Out! Out! Out.. Out! - No! I disagree! You're out! Hello. - Hello, Chandu. You look so sexy in half pants. Why are you feeling shy like a girl? From where are you calling? Why don't you appear before me? I'm love. I can't be seen. Look, have mercy on me and disconnect the call. And please let me play. Hey Chandu, why are you playing cricket like a kid? If you want to play, then play with my long black tresses. Play with my silky veil. Come in my dreams and play with my thoughts. Chandu, you're listening to my romantic talks with so much interest. No, this is not so. - You liar! I know that even your heart is tickling. So you fell in love with me. - No, I didn't fell. What if I make you fall? - No, you can't. Shall I make you fall? - Go ahead. So take this. Oh my God! So Chandu, you fell. - Yes. Shit! Yippee! Chandar, your problem is solved. Look at this, caller ID. Now when your dream girl will call.. ..then we'll come to know her number. And she will be caught. - Wow! What an idea! Yes, give me 2000 rupees. - How much will you rob me! You take all my pocket money. Hello. It is not telephone ring, but the doorbell. Harmeet, you? Yes. Chandar, is your telephone working? There is a call for you on my phone. My call on your phone? - Yes. Give it to me. - Go ahead and talk. Hello. - Hi, Chandu. You want to know my number? You've installed caller ID. What happened? - She is smarter than us. She knows that we've installed caller ID. - Shit! Chandu, you're eager to meet me, aren't you? No, no, no. This is not true. Yes it is true. Now write down my number. Jai, write down the number quickly. - Yes. Yes. - 362436. 362436. This number is of which area? This is her figure's number. What? - Yes. I hope you'll remember this number. Good night. Sweet dreams. Bye, Chandu. Hello. Hello.. dream girl.. dream girl. Chandar.. Chandar, what happened? Nothing. She disconnected the call. Chandar, what are you doing! You're banging the wall at night! I'll have to get him married now. Fool! Jai, tell me. How is it? - It's superb. Buy it. What is this? Remove it. - I was doing the trial. When will you reform! Yippee! I had nice fun. - Where were you? Let me tell you something. The bathroom here is strange. There is no tap or commode. There is only mirror all around. I did it on the ground only. - What! Fool! You peed in the changing room. It was an emergency. So I did it. - Well done. Chandar, Sapna's friend. Let's go and talk to her. Are you mad! - Yes. Hi! Hello. Hello. Hello. She ran away. She behaved as if she had never met you. A wealthy girl always behaves rudely. Paging for Chandar. Call for you. Please come to the customer service counter. Call for me? I'll just come. Excuse me. - Yes, sir. Is there a call for me? - Are you Mr. Chandar? Yes. - Here, sir. Hello. - Hey, Chandu. You? - Yes. You're flirting with a girl in the departmental store. First you greeted her, then you showed your style. I'm keeping a watch on you. Why? Are you jealous? Yes. If you even glanced at any other girl, then I'll kill you. Whatever. The girl was gorgeous. What tresses. What way of walk. I think so.. I love that girl. Hey, if you see my beauty, then you'll go mad. Really? So appear before me and show me your beauty. Fine. I'll give you my glimpse today. Turn around and see the mirror. So Chandu.. did you get a shock? What do you want? I.. I love you. Chandu, I love you. I love you, Chandu. "O beautiful, I like your attitude.." "Your style sets me on fire.." "O beautiful, I like your attitude.." "Your style sets me on fire.." "I love you, my heart says this.." "You stay in my heart.." "Your love flows in my breaths.." "O beautiful, I like your attitude.." "Your style sets me on fire.." "Look what my heart says.." "Look what my heart says.." "It lives on seeing you and dies to see your face.." "Even I sigh when I'm away from you beloved.." "My heart loves you, but I am scared of saying it.." "Saying this you have injured me.." "O beautiful, I like your attitude.." "Your style sets me on fire.." "There are many beauties in the world but none like you.." "There are many beauties in the world but none like you.." "There must be many Majnu's in this world, but none like me.." "Seeing your craziness, I believe you.." "Your heart is of a true lover, beloved, I've realized this.." "In your love my dear, I've become crazy.." "O beautiful, I like your attitude.." "Your style sets me on fire.." "I love you, my heart says this.." "You stay in my heart.." "Your love flows in my breaths.." "O beautiful, I like your attitude.." "Your style sets me on fire.." 'Chandu, I love you.' 'I love you, Chandu.' 'I love you.' 'Chandu, I love you.' 'I love you, Chandu.' Chandar dear, bring the breakfast quickly. Stop. You've already eaten a dozen bananas. Fine. I'll eat apples now. - Put it down. Dear, here. Your father is here. Learn. Learn from my son as to how to serve your father. What sandwich you've made! I'm sure it will be tasty. God bless you. Thank you. Yes. Use your strength. - Haya.. Continue eating. Dear, was it hen's egg? Why? Did you feel that it was a crocodile's egg? No, dinosaurs. Fool. Where is my watch? Here. Son, this is egg, not watch. This is egg? Then where is the omelette, dad? I eat that, son. I think along with the omelette I.. Why is the clock's alarm sound coming from my stomach? Because you eat omelette. What? You gave me watch along with the omelette? Now how do I shut this alarm clock? It rings after every 15 minutes. Do one thing. Eat banana. It will come out till morning. Shut up! Shut up! Chandar, what has happened to you? He has lost his peace. - He has fallen in love. You mean he is in love. - Yes, sir. Now I'll have to first solve this case. Otherwise today he gave me watch to eat.. ..tomorrow he'll give me fan, then cupboard. And then one day the furniture of this.. ..whole house will be in my stomach. No, it's dangerous thing. But who is this girl? - I don't know. What's her name? - I don't know, dad. Then have you fallen in love with a ghost. You don't know her name, her whereabouts. Where do you meet this girl? Her dream girl never meets him, uncle. She just talks to him on the phone. At what time does she calls? - Every morning at 10 o'clock. It's 10 o'clock. But she has still not called. Here is her call. Today you won't talk. Only I will talk. Now I'll make this girl accept her love.. ..make her the daughter-in-law of this house. Daughter-in-law, father-in-law is coming. Coming, coming, coming. Hello. Oh, sorry. Hello, dear. Hello. Give the phone to Chandu. Chandu is not at home. He has gone for his marriage. Dad! - What! Chandu is getting married? With whom? The girl who calls him day and night. Dream girl. Oh no! But I'm that dream girl. Strange. You used to call him and he is marrying somebody else. Dad, what are you doing? Let me handle this case. And shut up. Yes. - I won't let this happen. I love Chandu. Do you have any evidence of love? - No. Any eye witness? - No. Any agreement of love? - No! Then you've lost this case. And another girl wins. What do you mean? Dad... I mean that Chandar is going to marry in Anand Hall. Within an hour his wedding night will begin. I can't give any more information. Bye, thank you. Are you mad! Dad, you destroyed my home even before it was settled. In fact I helped you. Now look how she'll run and come. I'll see how he gets married. Dear, where are you going? Granny, sit in the car. I'll tell you. - Fine. Dad. - Yes. At last I'm going to get married. Dear, whenever I try to get you married.. ..there is always a hurdle. Will it happen today too? What? - Nothing. - Nothing. No, something is surely wrong. I'm the bride's father. I have the right to know. No, actually the matter is that whenever I try to get him married.. ..there is always some hurdle. He was supposed to get married in Bihar. There was a flood there and the bride and her parents died. What! - He was going to get married at Lathure. And there was an earthquake. Many people got buried and they are still not found. O my God! He was going to get married in Mumbai. There was a bomb blast and everybody disappeared. O my God! Why didn't you tell me this before? If we'd told you this before, then wouldn't you have run away? What? - It is his fate. - Yes. But if something like this happens here.. ..then I will be ruined. You will be ruined only once. We have been ruined so many times. - What! Today nothing bad will happen. Pundit-ji has said till the time we don't show.. ..his unlucky face to anybody, it will be auspicious time. Son, wear this flowery veil. Yes, wear it. Otherwise flood, earthquake, bomb blast.. What happened? What happened? Nothing, my bald father-in-law. Guests are bursting crackers outside. Okay. - Good luck. Good luck. Good luck. How are you laughing? Continue. Greetings! - Greetings! How are you? How is everybody at home? - Dad. Greetings. - Hello. Greetings! - Greetings! Come. Careful. Careful. From where do you buy your grocery? One shop is not sufficient. So I have to buy it from 2-3 shops. You are very healthy. After marriage you will have to control yourself. You used to sleep in every marriage.. ..and you used to make me stay awake. Before anything bad happens, start reading the mantras. You stay here. I'll go and handle him. But granny, how will you recognise him? Of course I'll recognise him. That fool must be wearing the flowery veil. Dad. How will you recognise her? I've given her a big shock. She'll come and shout out your name. Chandar! Son, what is this? - Dad. She's so old. Is she your dream girl? Uncle, she's not dream girl. She's drum girl. Bad choice, Chandar. Bad choice. - It happens. Girl's voice might be sweet, but in reality she's very sharp. Chandar! Hey, Chandar! - What happened? Why are you hiding you face? - Dad said not to show my face. I'll not spare your dad. You had an affair with my granddaughter. And for marriage, you found another girl. I didn't choose the girl, my dad did. Talk to him. You use do flirt with her on the phone. What about that? Dad is the one who flirts on the phone. Now I understood. You're dad's girlfriend. Dad, handle her. The auspicious time of my wedding is passing away. Idiot! I'll see how you marry. You'll marry only dream girl. Don't you love dream girl? Hey, what a man you are! Pooja! Pooja, come here! Come quickly. The auspicious time of my wedding is passing away. Shut up! She is Sapna's friend. - I like her. You're lucky, buddy. Pooja, look at him. You were madly in love with him? This disloyal fellow who's marrying somebody else. It is not his fault. Fault is mine. I only was madly in love with him. The truth is that he never loved me. I only was running after shadow. Stop! Let her suffer a bit more. Then only will there be sweet union. Dad. - Shut up. Dad, shall I change the party? - That fatso will not spare you. Dad, we have to take risk in love. Where are you going forsaking me, darling? When a gorgeous girl is before me.. ..then why will I marry a witch like you? Hey, you'll have to marry my daughter. Hey, you stay out of this. Otherwise I'll not spare you. Now nobody can stop me. Forgive me, sister. - Sister? Dear. - No, Chandar, no. I thought you were a true lover. I'd thought that you can do anything to have me. You'll love me a lot. You were everything for me. But today, you're going to marry somebody else. But I'll love you till the day I die. I'll love you till I die. I'll love you till I die. Chandar Dear, enough. Don't cry. Your each tear is an ocean for me. And this Chandar has drowned in it. This is not love. It I love forever. I'm your lover of many lifetimes. Lover. Lover. Lover. Pooja, how did you fell in love with this dark fellow? Didn't you find anybody else? I'm not a dark fellow. I'm a dark melody. What happened? Pooja. Pooja. Hey, why are you shouting? You're not Chandar. - I'm Chandar. What happened? You're not my Chandar. What do you mean? I've already left the bride. Come, what are you doing? Hey, don't touch me. I'll break your head. Hey, dream girl. Chandu, why did you play this prank on me? You used to play pranks on the phone, here I played. Now stop this game. I found my daughter-in-law. Now no need to romance covertly on the phone. Whatever you want to do, do it openly. You all can leave. The wedding is cancelled. Dad. - Very bad. Since the last 15 years, there has been twist in my marriage. But this twist was great. Son, what will you do now? Apologize to the old party. What else? Does she think that I'm mad! She was trying to fool me! How did they come in? Who invited them in? They want to ruin an innocent girl's life. We all should be ashamed! You, I and she! Come, my witch. I mean, beautiful. Beautiful! I'll become a witch and show you! Dad! She's a witch! They've become devils. Save us God! Run, son. Otherwise they'll kill us. "O my beloved, my dear, I am yours, I am lost in your love.."

"I swear on God, you swear on God, we'll never leave each other.." "O my beloved.." "My dear" Hey! What are you doing here at midnight? Look, Mathur. - Not Mathur. Say inspector Mathur.

Subhedar-ji, listen to me and don't lock horns with him. I think this guy is dangerous. You might have to repent it. Bhawandar. - Bhawandar. Just shut up. - Shut up. Okay. You come home late at night. You openly romance with a guy on the streets. You roam with cheap guys. This was bound to happen. And why will it not happen? After all you've raised her. - Stop this taunt! Pooja, if you marry any guy without thinking.. ..then your plight will be the same as mine. You shut up! Henceforth you won't meet that guy! Understood! What does he have! Nothing! Daddy, what did you have when you'd married mummy? Ill-mannered! You argue with me! Now you won't leave this house! You'll stay here only! This is my decision! Where is your son? - He is not at home. Tell him that Rudra had come. If he doesn't return my money in a week, then I'll not spare him! Understood! - Yes. Come! What is all this, dear? Nothing. I'd lost some money in gambling. How many times I've told you don't gamble. Now how will you repay this money? Mother, you don't worry. I'll repay it. Now where are you going?

These earrings belonged to my mother. It was her wish that her daughter-in-law should wear it. Where have you brought me? What's the time? - Around 12 o'clock. Oh. What are you doing, Chandu? - I'm just wiling away my time. You could have done that at home too. What was the need to come here? Let's go home. Get out! - Chandu, what prank is this! Not prank. Come out. Chandu. - Come out. Hold this. - But.. - Hold this! Happy birthday.. to Pooja. 26th August. Happy birthday, Pooja. Chandu, nobody has loved me so much. Even mummy daddy forgot that today is my birthday. But you didn't forget. Always love me like this. Always love me like this. Never part with me, Chandu. I won't be able to live without you. I won't be able to live. I won't be able to live. I won't be able to live. Chandar! Chandar! Chandar, Pooja's parents are getting Pooja engaged. And the guy's family has already reached their home. Greetings. - Greetings. Welcome. Greetings. Greetings, sister-in-law. - Greetings. Hello, dear. - Greetings. Did you have any problem in coming here? - No. Sit and have some sweets. - Sure. Pooja's mother is bringing Pooja here. Okay. - They'll be here in 5 minutes. What nonsense! The guy's family has come. Do you want to disgrace us? Aren't you aware of your father's anger? Yes, I know very well. You people can do whatever you want. I'll not marry this guy. Chandar, listen to me! Hey, who is the bridegroom? Dear, he is the bridegroom. Get up. Get up! Look, I and Pooja love each other a lot. And we've decided to get married to each other. Understood! But Pooja's marriage is fixed with me. You'll marry Pooja! Get out of here! Hey! A cheap lawyer's son! How dare you come here and boss around! You've come to break my daughter's marriage! I'll break your head! Rascal! Hey, don't abuse! - Yes, I'll do so! Rascal! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Chandar, what madness is this! - Pooja, I was.. How dare you touch my father! Pooja, listen to me. I don't want to listen to anything! Get out of here! We've taken the oath to live and die together. If you marry anyone else, then I'll kill you. And I'll kill myself too. Why do you always misunderstand things? She told you to go away so as to stop.. ..your and her father's fight. I wasn't fighting, his dad started it, dad. But, son.. - He fell on his own. And she was angry with me! She told me to get out! Hello. - Hello, Chandu.. Don't you dare to call me again! - Chandu. You say that Pooja didn't stand by you. If tomorrow somebody comes here and beat me.. ..will you do nothing? He has a point, Chandar. Hello. Tell her to forget Chandar. And marry the guy whom her father has chosen for her. Chandar, listen to me. Hello, Chandu! Chandu! Pooja, this is Jai, not Chandu. Jai, Jai, I want to meet Chandu. I want to talk to him urgently. Please, Jai. Forget that. He doesn't even want to listen to your name. He is very angry. No matter what, Jai. I want to meet Chandu. Please. Okay, I'll fix up the meeting. I'm coming to pick you up. Yes, right now. Jai, where have you brought me? I'd told you that I want to meet Chandu urgently. That's why I've got you here. Chandu is so angry that he can do anything if he sees you. I'd told Chandu's dad to explain it to him.. ..let him cool down and then get him here. Jai, the mistake is mine. I saw Chandu hitting dad and I told him to get out. But grandma told me about the misbehaviour.. ..that dad did with Chandu. So I want to meet Chandu and apologize, Jai. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Jai, I'm worried. God knows what will happen. I'm sorry, Pooja. Jai, what are you doing? - Take her away. No! No! No! Chandu! Let's go. - Leave me. Player. You're a big player. What a game you played! Till yesterday you were my debtor. Today I'm your debtor. Rudra. Only this much? - This is just the advance. You'll get the remaining after the good is sold. Thank you. Let me tell you one thing. - Yes. This one is a hot babe. I'll have fun with her. Baburao, it shouldn't be that the girl escapes.. ..from your grip.. otherwise I'll.. It might be easy to snatch meat from crocodile's mouth. But the one whom Baburao catches.. ..no one has ever been able to free her. I was just.. - Rudra, let's go. Dream girl.. dream girl.. dream girl.. Dream girl.. Yes, this is the right place. Come on, get out. Don't waste time. Time is money. Come. Take this. My play of 2000 rupees. What's the matter? Today, you're playing big. If you want to play, then play otherwise leave. Fine. 2000 for me. Greetings. Greetings, sir. Hey, why did it take you so much time? Sir, it takes time to bring a hot babe. Hey, uncover your veil. Come on. Show your beauty to sir. No need to be so simple. Take a look, sir. What a hot babe I've got for you! Yes, you're right. Take this. Thanks, sir. But I didn't know that you're such a big dealer. I used to sell ordinary girls to Baburao. You've sold him a beauty. I took advantage of two lovers' quarrel. And I earned money. In my family everybody says that.. ..they've not seen a worst rascal than me. But I think that I've not seen a worst rascal than you. What did you say? Don't feel bad, sir. Nowadays only rascals are at the top. Good people can't achieve anything. Eat.. 'Chandu, nobody has loved me so much.' 'Even mummy daddy forgot that today is my birthday.' 'But you didn't forget.' 'Always love me like this.' 'Always love me like this.' 'Never part with me, Chandu. I won't be able to live without you.' 'I won't be able to live.' 'I'll go. I'll go to my Pooja'. Catch him! Catch the rascal! Put him in the car! You were walking with an air of swagger. Today you've come under the grip of law and order. You thought that you're a big hero. You could abduct any girl from her house. And get her married. Does your father rules this country? Today I'll break your bones. Tell me the truth. Where is the girl? - Who? Stop this drama. And tell me where is Pooja? Pooja? What happened to Pooja? What happened to Pooja? Don't do drama. Pooja has been missing since yesterday morning. Tell me the truth. Where have you hid my daughter? What are you all saying? I can't understand. What has happened to Pooja? He won't speak up like this! Look, I don't know anything. I don't know anything. Beat him hardly. Beat him and he'll remember everything. Stop! Hey, dog. Stop! Give the keys otherwise I'll fire the bullet! Oh, shit! Go and get the key from there, Bhawandar. Why should I get it? I've taken a bath. You bath only once in a week. You go and get it. At least under this excuse you'll take a bath. Bhawandar Singh, go and get the key. Why should I get it? - Why? I'm DIG's brother-in-law. Shit! He is into shit now. What happened, Subhedar-ji? Now you've disgraced yourself. I didn't know that you'll fell in dung. Listen to me and leave this case. Otherwise next time you'll fall in gutter. Shall I say something, Bhawandar Singh? - Yes. Go to hell! "My beloved will come.. he will take me to Dubai." O my God! You're afraid of me? Why are you afraid of me? I'm that. Eat this. Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll not spare you! - Leave me! Hey! Leave him! Stop fluttering around! Otherwise I'll cut you wings! Take this! Hit her and teach her the tradition of this place! Stop! If you hit delicate body so much.. ..then it will leave behind marks! Then who will buy her. Her price will reduce. Stop her food and water. Only then will she understand and speak our language. I want to go to Chandu. I want to go home. I want to go home. Hello. Dad. Chandu, where are you? I was wandering here and there.. ..the whole night searching for you. Are you fine? I'm fine wherever I am. But Pooja is missing. And inspector Mathur and Pooja's dad are accusing me. Son, I know that you're innocent. Surrender yourself to the police. I'll prove that you're innocent. It is not important to prove my innocence, dad. What is important is to find Pooja. Give me your blessings. So that I can safely bring your to-be daughter-in-law. Son, my blessings are always with you. May God bless you! I love you, dad. I love you too, son. Pooja, where are you? Where are you? Leave me. - Come! Leave me! Leave me! Pooja. Leave me! - Come. Pooja! Leave me! Leave me! Thanks, thanks. 'Pooja.' Pooja! Pooja! Pooja! Hi! What are you hiding? - Nothing. I know. You've got a gift for me. - Yes. Then give it to me. Give. - First close your eyes. Yes. - Don't open it. You! Come here. I won't spare you! Okay! Okay! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Now remove me from my face. Come on. "What do you know, how much I love you." "I only wait for you." "This is our craziness." "I don't feel relieved till I see you." "Come and embrace me." "What do you know, how much I love you." "I only wait for you." "This is our craziness." "I don't feel relieved till I see you." "Come and embrace me." "Never before was.. ..my heart so mad in love." "What is love, I deciphered.. ..after I found you." "I saw you, I fell in love with you, I became yours." "Beloved, I got immersed in your dreams." "Come let me kiss you again and again." "What do you know, how much I love you." "I only wait for you." "This is our craziness." "I don't feel relieved till I see you." "Come and embrace me." "What a lovely romantic weather it is!" "The moonlight is in my embrace." "What is dispersed here and there.. ..is the light of love." "The world of my love is on your basis." "Nobody gets a lover like you." "I'm willing to die for you, beloved." "What do you know, how much I love you." "I only wait for you." "This is our craziness." "I don't feel relieved till I see you." "Come and embrace me." Get up! Get up! - No! Come! - Leave me! Leave me! Leave me! Where are you taking me! - Come! Leave me! Leave me! Leave me! Leave me! Come. Leave me! - Come. Leave me! Hey! Leave her! This is the way to bring a delicate girl! No, come here. Sit, dear. Don't be afraid. Come. Come! So? Are you all dazzled by her beauty? Hey, Sheikh. Say the price. 5 lakhs. 10 lakhs. 15 lakhs. No, no. This deal can't happen. 20 lakhs. - No. You all can't afford to buy to this girl. Why are you asking such a high price for this girl! Say, say. How much do you want for this girl? Say, say. 50 lakhs. - Done, done. Now this girl is mine. I'll marry her. And I'll take her to my country. With 48 hours bring the payment. Till then I'll arrange for her fake passport and visa. Thanks. Thanks a lot, Baburao. Thanks a lot. You completed my wish. What's happening with me? What is happening? These people sold me! They made my deal! Yes. Tell me. - Where is your son Jai? Actually he has not come back home since last night. Tell him to come to the police station and meet me. Otherwise the consequences will not be good. Did you understand? - Yes, sir. Tell me, where is Chandar? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me, you idiot! Otherwise I will pull off your skin! Tell me. - I don't know, sir. - I don't know. Hey! You tell me. Tell me. Where is Chandar? I don't know, sir. Tell me. Otherwise you will be imprisoned all your life. Hey! Tell me where is Chandar? I will tell you. I will tell you. But in the side. - Let's go. Tell me. Tell me. - I will tell you in your ears. Tell me. I don't know!!!! Hey! What is wrong with you? Yeah! What is wrong with you? Why did you scream so loudly? If you don't know then you must say clearly.. ..that you don't know. From when I am telling all of you that I don't know. I don't know. But nobody listens to me. So I thought that you would be deaf. That is why, I yelled loudly. - Rascal. Hit me! Hit me! Today I will teach you a very good lesson. Will you teach me a lesson? You rascal! You have searched Pooja everywhere. You looked out for her in the entire city. But you were unable to find her anywhere. I think that it was the decision of her parent's. Your anger on that day. She was unable to tolerate all that. Chandar, is it so that Pooja might have.. ..committed suicide? No! She had promised me that if she would survive.. ..then it would be with me. If she would die then also it would be with me only. No! No! I did not mean to say this. Actually.. - She is alive. My heart says so. She is definitely in some problem. Yes. Even I feel the same. Nowadays, the number of kidnapping cases.. ..has increased so much in this city. It is possible that somebody might have kidnapped her.. ..for the greed of money. You are right. - Yes, Chandar. And I know such a person who can give us.. ..the correct information about all this? Where will we find him? - In Sun Light club! "My cheeks are very fair. My walk is very pretentious." "Look at my thin waist. All the lovers have gone crazy." "My cheeks are very fair. My walk is very pretentious." "Look at my thin waist. All the lovers have gone crazy." "Take out your veil. Just take out your veil." "Let everyone in this gathering enjoy themselves." "Take out your veil. Just take out your veil." "Show us some magic. Just show us some magic." "My cheeks are very fair. My walk is very pretentious." "Look at my thin waist. All the lovers have gone crazy." "My veil is of velvet cloth." "My sarong is properly embroidered." "Nobody can value it." "My beauty is very expensive." "Just move your veil a little." "Turn around your sarong once." "We will give you whatever you ask for." "Intoxicate us through your eyes." "I will give you the earrings of my ears." "I will give you the pleasure of my luscious lips." "I will give you the youth of my cheeks." "I will give you all the pleasures." "Take out your veil. Just take out your veil." "Let everyone in this gathering enjoy themselves." "Take out your veil. Just take out your veil." "Show us some magic. Just show us some magic." "My cheeks are very fair. My walk is very pretentious." "Look at my thin waist. All the lovers have gone crazy." "Let the sensuous desires be controlled, my lover." "I will surely show you all the magic." "Let the night be more romantic." "Do not make us suffer like this." "Let us take you in our arms." "We will give you lots of reward." "Allow us to do whatever we want to do."

My walk is very pretentious." "Look at my thin waist. All the lovers have gone crazy." 'This earring belongs to Pooja!' Jai, tell me where is Pooja? Jai! You are my childhood friend. Don't do this to me! Tell me, where is Pooja? Please. Jai! Jai, listen to me. - Chandar! Hey, Chandar! Don't move! Or else I will shoot you. Now your escaping has come to an end, dear. Inspector, listen to me at least. I am innocent. Now whatever you have to say, go up and speak to God. Because I am going to kill you very soon now. Dear, remember the Almighty. Remember the Almighty. Remember the Almighty. Hey! What are you doing? You rascal! Hey!.. You rascal! Hey, father! Father, I have got married, father. - Yes, child. And on top of that, the problem that was supposed.. ..to arrive even that has not yet come. - It has not come! I am very happy, father. Oh god! Father, what is this sound? A six-feet tall man has fallen on your wife. A six-feet man has fallen on my wife! - Yes, son. Hey, brother! Why did you fall from above? Did you have to fall on my wife only? You know how much I love my wife. I love my wife. Excuse me. Please move aside. Pandit-ji, where is my wife? - It is she only. It's me. - Don't joke with me. Go away. Where is my wife? - She is your wife. I am only your wife. Inspector, you have made my tall wife so short now. Come on. Make her tall once again. - How should I? In the same way, as you had made her short. Make her tall now. I cannot do it! Don't touch a policeman! Or else I will imprison you. He is threatening me of a policeman! He has ruined me! But I will not spare you. As Reena Roy had made a note of all the heroes.. ..in the film 'Nagin', in the same way.. ..even I have made a note of you. I will not spare you. My dear husband. Come on. Lets go and celebrate our honeymoon. Do you want to celebrate a honeymoon? - Yes. Look at your size. You have become so short. And the kids that you will give birth to will be so tiny. They will run around in the entire area. They will hide inside the holes. Who will search for them? Your father or my father! Come on. Lets go. Where do I come with you? This is not done. It's just not done. Somebody please explain to her. Hey, Pandit! Say such prayers that she will become tall now. It is not possible. - It is not possible. Then go away from here. Get lost! My dear husband! My dear husband! Don't cry! When daughter Pooja was with us.. ..then we never realized her importance. Maybe.. Maybe that is why, God has given us.. ..this punishment. He has vanished our daughter Pooja. Oh my God! Please protect our child! Please protect our child! I never even thought that my childhood friend.. ..my childhood buddy would betray me this way. I don't know that where has he hidden my Pooja? But in order to search Pooja, it is necessary for us.. ..to search that Jai first. Let that rascal be anywhere! I will surely search him. Why, Gadru? What information have you brought? Sir, the information is this that my neighbour.. ..is going to run away tonight. Is that girl a minor or an adult? She is an adult, sir. So then what is the complaint? The complaint is this that earlier.. ..she was supposed to run away with me. Today she is running away with someone else. Hey, you drunkard! How will you manage.. ..to run away with a girl? You will die on the way back now. - Sir! Sir! Sir. Please save me, sir. You are Chandar's friend, isn't it? I am not. But I was. I had only given you that information yesterday. Oh, I see. And he knows about it now. That is why, he is after me now. So you want protection, isn't it? - Yes. Protection as well as Chandar's arrest! Sir, I am that prey with whose help you can get hold of him. Just a minute! Just a minute! Just a minute! Subhedar-ji! - Yes. Sir, it should not happen that in the process.. ..of getting hold of him through his help.. ..a middleman might fall in danger. What do you mean? - I mean you. Out! Get out! - It's fine with me if you want me to get out. Anyway, I wanted to drink tea from a very long time. Who will stand here and waste his time? Look Jai, now I will make such a plan.. ..that he will not at all be able to escape. Why, Gadru? You understood that what you have to do. Isn't it? I have understood it, sir. I have understood it. His game is over. But we will definitely have to think of some way.. ..in order to find Jai, isn't it? Sir! I can show you the way. Because the place where he is hiding.. ..I know that path that lane and that house too. Who are you? My name is Gadru Khabri. If I will get 1000 rupees then I will inform the lion.. ..about the whereabouts of his prey. And if the information will be wrong then? Then you can kill me anytime. Immediately give me some money. Yes! You rascal. I will.. You were searching your friend, isn't it? Don't worry! Jai is absolutely safe.. ..in my secret informer Gadru's house. But right now, you are very unsafe, my dear. Just look around and see. Look around. I had told you that one day you would definitely.. ..come under my control. So then today, I will not only hit you. But I will hit you until you die. You rascal! You! Why, inspector sir? You are completely shocked, isn't it? Don't be surprised! I will explain it to you. Look. Two kilos of cotton. And this 2 inches heel. And this tape recorder has fooled you. This is known as tit for tat. You rascal! You have known about Jai's whereabouts from me. But before you can convey this information to Chandar.. ..I will ruin you completely. Just a minute! Just a minute! Chandar already has this information. Who has conveyed this information? - You have. Me? - Yes! You just said that Jai is safe at Gadru's house. And Chandar has heard it through the mobile phone. It is switched on. At least say hello to Chandar. Subhedar-ji, I had thought that this guy is just threatening you. But he has indeed taught you a lesson today. Now tell us what will happen ahead? I will tell you. I will tell you. - Yes. I have taught one lesson to your.. Subhedar-ji! - Yes. And the second.. - Lesson. Lesson. Yeah! Chandar will teach it to Jai. Jai! Jai! Jai! Tell me. Tell me. Tell me where is Pooja? Tell me. No, Chandar! Tell me. Tell me where is my Pooja? Otherwise I will kill you. Tell me. Tell me. - I will.. I will tell you. I have sold your Pooja to the prostitute's market. Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! - Come on. Come on. Let go of me! Who have you brought over here? Who is he? - He has.. He has come here for Pooja. He has hit me a lot. Do not spare him! Baburao, hand over my Pooja to me. Hey! Let it be Pooja or anybody else. Those girls who come here once, they never return back. Did you understand? Come on. Leave now. Hey, leave! Hey, Baburao! Let go of my Pooja! Let go of my Pooja! Pooja! Pooja! Pooja! - Chandar! Pooja! Pooja! - Chandu! Chandu! Chandu! Chandu! - Pooja! Let go of me. Let go of me. Take her away! Take her away! No! Pooja! - Let go of me. Pooja! - Let go of me. Chandu! Chandu! - Pooja! Pooja! Pooja! No! Chandu! Catch him. Get up. Come on. Run away from here! Chandar! Chandar! Chandar! Chandar! - Pooja! Chandar! Chandar! Chandar! What happened to you? - Pooja! My Pooja! Chandar! Chandar! Control yourself, Chandar! Pooja! - Chandar! Chandar! Chandar! Is anybody here? Dear Chandar! - Chandar! Dear Chandar, what is all this? How did all this happen? Chandar! Chandar! Dear Chandar! Chandar! "Lover! You have made me a lover!" "Lover! You have made me a lover!" "My heart is with you." "Your heart is with me." "What is this strange thing?" "My darling, this is only love." "My darling, this is only love." Chandar! Chandar! Chandar! - What is happening to you, son? "Never give me the poison of separation, my sweetheart." "Now I neither want to die without you." "Nor do I want to survive without you." "Survive! I don't want to survive alone now." "On the pleasant paths of love." "In the pleasant and joyful shelter." "There is the wall of this world." "My darling, this is only love." "Lover! You have made me a lover!" "My heart is with you." "Your heart is with me." "What is this strange thing?" "My darling, this is only love." "My darling, this is only love" Pooja! They have taken away my Pooja! - Hold on. Hold on, Chandar! - No! Pooja! Pooja! - Dear Chandar. My Chandar! Chandar relax. - No, Chandar! No! Sir, yours.. Your sister's.. Your sister's.. Your sister's.. Why are you after his sister? Is his sister going to give birth to a child? What is this rubbish? He is not saying anything ahead of that. - Shut up! Go ahead. - Tell me what were you saying? That Chandar is hiding at your sister's house. You go immediately and get hold of him. Well done, Gadru! Well done! Now I will not spare him. Bhawandar Singh, come with me! - Lets go. Subhedar-ji! - Yes. Are you intending to walk up till there? - Why? Because the keys to the jeep are left inside only. Then go and bring it. So you should have told me earlier. You did not tell me. So go and bring it now. Sir. - Yes. My commission. - Yes. Take this. Bhawandar Singh, hurry up! - Here I am. So then why were you taking so long? - I was solving your problem. So come on. Lets go now. - Yes. Let's go. Wait! You go from here. You go from here. - Bhawandar Singh! You rascal! Are you showing me the bananas? Tell me, where is Chandar? I had received a call from the police station only. Asking Chandar to run away from here. So he ran away from here. Who had called up? - I had called up, sir. Why? - Because Subhedar-ji, whenever you have.. ..come across that boy, you have always lost to him. So I don't like it. Hey, Bhawandar Singh! You have helped a criminal. No! Subhedar-ji, no! I have not supported a criminal. I have supported an innocent man. You must not speak only about law, Subhedar-ji! In front of me, you have accepted bribe.. ..and let the robbers, murderers and goons go. I have seen it myself. Under the cover of law, you are just taking.. ..your personal revenge. Bhawandar Singh! If I want then I can suspend you right now. How will you suspend me? Hey! I have made you an inspector by referring.. ..your name to my brother-in-law again and again. What is the value of a constable's post? Under your cover, I will not accept the post of an ACP also. I will sit on the footpath with a stall. And I will sell the bananas. But I will not be a slave to you. Hold this stick! And goodbye! Bhawandar Singh! Bhawandar Singh! Listen to me. Bhawandar Singh! Come. Where did Chandar go? Hello Rudra! Ask Sheikh to bring the money and come there. Yes. To the same place. The passport and the money are ready. I am coming in a short while along with that girl. All right! Vaishali! Hey Vaishali! Yes. Take this. Ask that girl to wear a veil and come. Yes. Hey! Bring her here! Come on. Come on. Come on. Are you acting too smart? Sit inside the car. A jeweller recognizes his diamond very well. And I recognise my girls very well. Who has how much blood in her veins? I know it very well. There is only one way of saving yourself from Baburao. The way of death! Pooja, run away! Pooja, run away! You rascal! I will not let you ruin another girl's life. Pooja, run away! Pooja, run away! Vaishali! Chandar! Pooja! - What happened to Pooja? They have taken away Pooja. - Where? Rudra, Samira Manzil. Save her. Take this passport. Now she is Shareefa Begum. Take her away! And enjoy yourself! Thank you, Baburao. Thank you very much. Sheikh sir, your work is done. What about our payment? Your payment! Here, it is. Count it. It is complete 50 lakhs. Now the payment is done. Where is my sweetheart? - Rudra! Hey! Bring the girl over here. - Let go of me. I will not go anywhere. I will not go anywhere. Let go of me. Let go of me. I will kill you! Let go of me. Let go of me. I will not spare you. I will not spare you. Jai, just stop her from speaking anymore. No! No! Please. No! No! No! I will kill you! I will.. I will kill you! Sheikh sir. - Thank you. Move the car away! Hey! Move the car away! Hey! Take it away! Move your car! Move your car! Move your car! Move your car! Look, who is it? Tell me where is Pooja? - I don't know. Tell me. I will tell you. I will tell you. Baburao has sold Pooja to Sheikh. He is taking her abroad in the flight at 2.30. Yeah! I have finally hanged you up. You rascal! Hey! Who are you? I am the same person on whose wife you had fallen down. And like the heroine Reena Roy of the film 'Nagin'.. ..even I have pictured you in my eye. That is why, even I have hanged you. First you come here and make her tall. Hey! Because of you, my honeymoon.. ..has been postponed. You come and make her tall. Otherwise, I will hang you. Put me down! - Put you down! Hey! I will send you to heaven from there itself. You don't know me well! Look, I am.. I am telling you.. What are you telling me? Are you my father? Hey! It is not the time to say anything. It is the time to do something. And I will do it right now, right here. You don't know me well! My husband, what is this rubbish? Will you just keep talking to him? Please do something. Hey! You have made her size short. But her mouth is still very big. She speaks so much. I have lots of problems. Do you know about that? - My dear husband! Shut up! If you will say another word now.. ..then I will kill you right here. You don't know me well! Oh my God! What happened? What has happened? I have become short. Absolutely perfect! It has been adjusted properly now. Inspector sir, thanks a lot! Now we will properly celebrate our honeymoon also. We will have too many kids also. And then they will give you lots of blessing also. Come on, darling! - My dear husband! Let's celebrate our honeymoon! "In the ship of love!" "In the ship of love!" "In the fun of these swirling waves." "Among these blowing winds." "We are moving faster and faster." "Far away from the sky above us." Baburao sir, greetings! Sheikh sir is our very special guest. Take him peacefully up to the plane. Baburao sir, have I ever troubled.. ..any of your guests until today? Take this. Thank you. All right, Baburao. We shall meet again. Goodbye! - Goodbye! Let's go, officer. - Come with me. Come on, Khan sir. Hurry up! 'Flight no. IC415 schedule today for Singapore and bangkok' 'Flight no. IC415 schedule today for Singapore and bangkok within 2 hours' 'Thank you.' 'May I have your attention please?' 'Passengers travel Flight IC919 going to Sharjah..' 'Thank you.' 'Kindly proceed for the security check.' 'Thank you.' Sheikh sir, let's go. - Let's go. 'May I have your attention please?' 'Flight IC919 going to Sharjah, Dubai is ready for departure.' 'Passengers are requested to proceed to gate number 9.' 'Thank you.' Hey! What are you doing? Pooja! Let go of me! Let go of me! Pooja! Pooja! This boy is her lover. He will definitely create nuisance over here. You all will have to stand here for half an hour.. ..in this immigration line. So officer, what should we do now? Tell me. Tell me quickly. I will take you all from the VIP enclosure. Come with me. - Hurry up! Hey! Hey! Baburao, that girl's lover has come to the airport. No! I have come across a crazy lover like you for the first time. So then I will have to give you a chance. Look, your girlfriend is lying at the feet of 10 feet. If you have the courage then come here and pick her up. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Take her. Hey! Take her. Come. Hit me! Come here. Come. Come to me. Come! Chandar! Chandar! Let go of him! Let go of him! Let go of him! I will not spare you. I will not spare you. - You bitch! I will not spare you. Will you hit me? Will you hit Baburao? Hey! Kill him, Chandu! Kill him! Kill him, Chandu! Don't leave him! Kill him! Don't spare him. Don't spare him, Chandu! Don't spare him! Hit him! Don't spare him! Hit him! Don't come ahead, Chandar! I will kill you. Don't come ahead! Chandar! No! I admire you today, Subhedar-ji! You have let gone of your personal enmity.. ..and fulfilled your duty for the first time today. This Bhawandar Singh salutes you wholeheartedly. Chandu! Chandu! Chandu!
