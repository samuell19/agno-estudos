They forced me to admit to something I didn't do. You can speak freely here. I'd like to talk to the DA. Sorry. There's a mandatory ethics training he had to attend. Hope you understand. Ji-na's sister was bringing some food over this morning, and found her body. COD is strangulation. Based on her stomach content, time of death was between 2210023100. Unfortunately, we have you on the elevator surveillance leaving the building at 22:15. Semen we found on her body matches your DNA. With evidences lining up I think the police might have jumped to the conclusion. We were lovers. She was fine when I left. By the way, professor, you returned to her place this morning. She didn't answer her phone, so I went to check on her. Why didn't you call the police? I freaked out when I saw her dead body. Of course. Most people would. When is the DA getting here? He might be a while. Think about it. I am a professor, a public figure. Why would I kill a working girl I met in a bar? You're right. No motive. But we'll need to continue with the investigation. I'd like to call my family. The phone is turned off... Honey, it's me. I'm in trouble. Whatever anybody tells you, don't believe them. I will explain everything later. You can visit, so call me. I'm sorry, honey. I love you... We're going to be fine Don't worry. Where the hell is he? Hello, anyone home? Hello, anyone home? You were hiding in the balcony... No! I'm so close. Honey... Don't call me honey! Oh honey Give me back the keys. I lost them. Fine. PH change the locks. Ji-na, come on. I'll convince my mom. Please don't do this. Always the same excuses Fm sick of it. What can I do? Kill my own mother? Are you still here, Ji-na? Fm home... Crazy son of a... f know you hate me... You loved Ji-na, but you killed hen Do you admit to this? Yes, I killed her... I love you, Ji-na... Who is this? Time to go now, Mr.HAN. It's been a rough journey. It's over now. Are you still here, Ji-na? I'm home... I know you hate me... You loved Ji-na, but you killed her. Do you admit to this? Yes, I killed her... How will you prove your love and pay for your sins? Who is this? This mic is for close range. It listens through concrete walls. But the receiver is only within 15m range. Precision sound quality. Where'd you get this? Ah, I found it in my office. Really? Internal audit, maybe? Weird... I know. Very weird. Sorry for dragging you into something like this. You had my back in the army. I really appreciate it, man. Anyway, I know nothing. I'm picking your door. Yeah, don't worry about it. You said you want me to pick another lock, if this isn't it. Got it! This is it. Son of a bitch! Change of Pension Application Police station Kim Jeonghun How can he be a cop? How the hell can he do this? I will give him more than death. How the hell can I get rid of him? For murder, you get death, life or more than 5 years according to Criminal Law, article 250. Since it will be you first offense, with the right lawyer, maybe 7 years? Your wife is the key witness, but I can't reach her. Have you talked to her yet? She must be in shock. She's not used to how crazy this world is. Please talk to her for me. Professor KIM, got anything else for me? Are you sure you didn't leave anything out? So it's not that I can't trust my own lawyer. My lawyer doesn't trust me, at all. You think I killed her? It's not what I think. It's what the judge thinks that's important. I didn't realize I had to convince my own lawyer, damn it! I loved her. I really did. I thought she was just a fling. Nothing serious. We weren't serious, but I still loved her. You got any cigarettes? I can't even remember when I quit. The DA is your junior, right? Put in a good word, okay? He's at the dentist. Fuck! He's never around. I haven't seen him yet. By the way, I'm not here to bring you cigarettes. Thanks girl. My sister asked. She got caught skipping classes. Yeah, an alibi... Thanks a lot. It's done, okay? Okay... You say we've been dating since last month. Why do we have to do this? You can't just say you were home watching TV? If I say I was alone, it complicates things. People at work told me to say I went to the movies. Okay... It will be over soon... Hello? Hello? You must know you own sins. Who is this? Cutoff your own ear, or I'll do it for you. Oh, I know this voice Why'd you take my CDs? You wire-tapping piece of shit. You're the worst pervert. I could grind you up in pieces, you son of a bitch! It was an accident, so turn yourself in, and the extenuating circumstances will be taken into consideration. Don't be cocky, you high school grad! Watch your mouth! You scumbag! You were a loner, right? How can you be a cop? Where's the justice in this country, damn it! Justice? Is that why you killed her? You listen! I killed her because I loved her so much. We were gonna get married. You know why she went to work night jobs? Because my parents didn't approve of our relationship. I know. Your mother didn't like her for being a poor orphan. Don't say her name, fucker! I will rip you apart, you motherfucker! Is cursing what you learned from college? I'm warning you Don't swear at me. Fuck off, retard! Son of a bitch. Cunt!

I call your work. Where are you? For someone allegedly sick you sure are getting around. Shut your trap, you fucker. Ji-na loved Professor KIM. She wanted to marry him. She only saw you because you were stalking her. She always liked someone like her dad. You didn't know? I did. I have her on tape. You're sick. You're the Worst kind of evil! What about the professor? The one who's taking the fall for your crime? He slept with young girls, he deserves it. You're crazy. You really are selfish! How can you only think from your side? My side? Look Who's talking? What's the pervert's side then? Are you some kind of altruistic pervert? I didn't cause her any harm. Crazy fucker! You listened to her every move! What the hell? I can't talk to you. Return my CDs and hard drive. Or I'll call the police. Don't kid yourself. I'm going lo kill myself before the cops show up. Before that, I'm going to cutoff a pervert's ear. You said you killed her for love? That's not love. Hey, you cock-sucker! What do you know about love? I warned you not to swear. Whoa, that's weird. Jung-hoon... Did you go work out? Did you have breakfast? You should never skip breakfast. You promised. I gotta shower. I'll call you on my way out. Thank you for waking me up. Who are you? Huh? Hello. I am Ji-na's guardian. Mr. KWON, I always wondered, what does GG stand for? Is it a new slang, like in video games? No, Mr. PARK. GG means Golden Guggenheim. Guggenheim? The art museum? What's with Golden? What does that mean? Oh no. No meaning. Just made it up. Cause it looks fancy? I'm sorry, Mr. PARK. I'll make payment next week... I can't get angry because of my blood pressure. I just lost precious 50 grand! And you don't pay on time, when I'm counting on you, you're exacerbating the situation. I don't even wanna... I'm sorry... She's the ace of my bar. Hey, who do you think I am? This isn't cool. Think of it as a token of my dedication. I'll make payment on time. I trust that you will. Oh no no. I'm not mad. I'm not angry. I guess you try your best but can't always succeed. I don't get angry... What are you doing? Oh, I'm just trying to give you good service. No no, I don't do that. That's dirty. Okay fine. I want you to do something else. Tickle my feet. Don't massage, just tickle. Hey! Yes, sir. In human emotions, we've got joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure. What do you think is the most important emotion? Which one is the boss? I think pleasure? Isn't it the best when you have sex with a woman? Anger is the boss of them. You know why? When you're angry, you can't get happy, can't get sad, can't feel joy. But the opposite is possible. If I make a lot of money, I'm happy. Then someone makes more, are you pissed off or not? Your dog died, you're so sad. But when you think of the driver who hit your dog, are you pissed off or not? Say we're at a karaoke, having so much fun. The owner doesn't give any free service. Are you pissed off or not? If the karaoke doesn't give free service, it really pisses me off. Of course, you're pissed off. Which is why anger is the boss of human emotions. So, if you can manage your anger, you can manage your mind. What are you doing? Is this the best you got? Is this how you provide service to your clients? Shouldn't you be paying close attention to me? I'm sorry, sir. Min-tee. Yes, sir. Wanna hear a Greek mythology? A long time ago, there was a god of care and concern. His name was Cura. Sakura? Don't do that. Not funny. Sorry, sir. One day, Cura decided to make human beings. But he didn't have material. So he borrowed dirt from god of land and he went to Zeus, to blow in human soul. That's how human beings were made. Then the gods saw human actions, which they found so adorable. So the god of care, god of land, and Zeus began fighting over the right to own humans. So they went to court Do gods have a court? Of course. They had a god of justice. So the verdict was first, when people die, the god of land can have the body. That's why we get buried in the ground. Second, when people die Zeus takes the soul. Then Cura got pissed off! I planned and ran this human project. What do I end up with? So the god of justice gave another ruling. Cura, you can have ownership of humans while they're alive. That's quite a story. That's why humans are constantly worrying and concerned, get it? If worries and concerns grow, are you happy? Joyful? Sad? No! A girl took my money and died, and the killer is my VIP guest, how should I feel? You get pissed off! Humans are born to be angry machines. I get angry, therefore, I exist! Homo lratus! I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, sir. The car moved too fast. Hey, it hurts. I'm sorry... But if I hold back, it will be worse. I'm going to hit you. Did Mr. KWON put you up to this? To pop my blood vessels? Let's calm down. Forgive. She meant well. My toes... hurt so much! Hello. I am Ji-na's guardian. You know the girl who lived here. Well, she wasn't the owner. She rented. Eh, I just hurt my foot, so I'm moving slow. I know it's late I shouldn't be here. Right? You look busy. I have to check the gas valve, you know. Have you eaten yet? Her aunt is really worried, so I've been planning to visit, I told her to do a monthly rent, but she insisted on long-term lease. So I need to find the lease, where is that? Is this it? How dare you draw a knife at me! Why don't you tell me? Why you broke the police tape for emergency electrical work? If you don't talk I will show you pain. Not just any pain, greatest pain, ever. I'll tell you. If you say you came for the chandelier in the room I will really show you unforgettable pain. God bless the makr! There's an audio system that will go for 5 grand. You came for the chandelier which is less than $700. Lie better, or don't lie. Come closer. I don't want to get blood all over. Please don't. I'm so sorry. Don't move. Relax, or it will hurt more. Why are your nails so short... This is police brutality! The interrogation is too long, and I'm denied visitation. I refuse to answer any question from now on. It is your right to refuse giving statements. But the interrogation is dragging because you're taking your time. And no one's come to visit you. I won't talk to you anymore. Where is the DA? I'm sorry. Regrettably, he had to go to a funeral. He used to miss his own sister's wedding for his investigation. I'm sorry he can't be here. Are you kidding me? You and the DA, I won't forget this. My apologies, if you're upset. Don't say you're sorry. Are you frigging kidding me? I'm sorry. I told you not to say that! Don't say you're sorry. I want my lawyer. This is inhumane! I'm a professor with the National University Shut your trap! Every word out of your mouth has been a lie. I should rip your trap open! Professor, my ass... Well, you got upset, so all I can say is I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled at you. What's this? Your lawyer asked me. No thank you. We found a red necktie in your TA's desk. It matches the fiber we found on her neck. Well, she insisted on collecting my stuff. - So it is the murder weapon. - No. Not that it isn't. I mean, I didn't do it. Well, that morning, I saw the necktie around her neck. It was a 90th anniversary tie from the university. I didn't want it to tarnish the school's reputation. You will find fingerprints other than mine... Fingerprints are hard to find on neckties. What? I want to talk to my wife. Please do come in. It's your sweet home. You didn't put a camera on the bed? No... You idiot. How could you miss the most important shot? Mr. HAN... You owe me 50 grand. Do you know the professor's home number? Of course, you don't. Nothing here is worth any money. Sir. I've cleaned it all up. Good job. Take these CDs and hard drives to the car. Yes, sir. No, you can't take them. No? No? Don't you dare! Put them in the trunk. What will you do with them? High class officials usually go crazy about these rare findings. If we only had video tapes... Oh, Rococo! Min-Tee, please make sure our officer here doesn't get any funny ideas. Massage him up, okay? Rococo! Okay. I will massage everywhere but your hands. We really should take care of our health. Watch your cholesterol. The reason I'm calling is to ask you to trace a phone number. Be quiet! Didn't I tell you to stop crying? Sir... The trunk won't close. Can we let her go? Come on, Min-tee. Haven't you heard? Treat others as you would like to be treated. Can we let a girl out on the street in this scary awful world? Do you know where Mr. HAN is right now? This murderer is off enjoying himself... You bastard! Who the hell are you? Ji-yeon, I'm a murderer. I killed someone. I'm a criminal. I'm trash. I can't get any sleep. Ji-na! Ji-na! I'm so sorry! It's all my fault! Message to Ji-yeon I'm sorry Hey! Hey you! Is that you? Huh? What happened here? Mr. PARK? Who is that? A loan shark. From the bar. The owner's brother. Jr-na borrowed 50 grand. 50 grand? Why would she? That's why she took the job at the wedding studio. He introduced her to the professor. Bullshit! I can take care of it. You don't even do after-hours job. What are you taking care of? I'm not asking you to take on another gentleman. He's not just any professor. His in-laws are really Well off. I'm done asking him for money. Our professor is going to be a really important figure in 10 years. You can be the First, I mean, the Second Lady. You need to balance both short and long-term investments. I'm going to quit the bar, soon. Where the hell is he? He's looking for you. He has your phone number. He took her voice tapes. I need them back. PARK Myung-rok... Hello? Ji-yeon, did anyone call me on my mobile? Where are you? I'm with your co-workers. What? Who? Where's the restroom? - Outside the corner - Okay, outside. You son of a bitch! Mr. HAN? Caller ID."

Min-tee, bring the CDs from the car. Yes, sir. Eun-young, what do you think? I think this is nice. Mr. HAN, what do you think? Look. Look at it! What are you talking about? You like it, don't you? Turn that shit off, you motherfucker! She is dead because of you. You are the devil! It was you that killed her. You crazy fucker. Aren't you funny? Did I do what? Okay, okay. I won't say that. Keep him quiet. Hey you mother fucker! Son of a bitch! Hello? Did you send me the text? Yes, Mrs. KIM. How worried you must be. Excuse me, who is this? What's that? That's a new bag. I just bought it. I don't even know where to begin... Let me ask you a question first. If that's okay? Of course, it's okay. Our lawyer tells me that... you were playing house with a girl from the bar, and that I had to be understanding. Because other men get to relieve themselves by prostitution. Yet, you're too famous to go through with that. Am I right? I wasn't exactly playing house, honey. How many times a week? Once or twice, but the important thing is... Half the time you came home late you were with her, then? Mr. KIM... Do you remember what I asked you when we got married? - I can't even tell you how sorry... - Tell me... Honey, what are you doing? lam begging you... Say it! If I were to cheat on you, don't sleep with the same girl twice. So you do remember. What was your favorite position? Sweetie, stop it! Tell me. I'm just curious. It's all the same. Normal stuff. This way, and that way. Why are you asking me this? On the day you slept with her, did you sleep with me too? Honey... you're killing me. Suck it up. If you answer earnestly, I might ask my dad for a favor. What did you say? Dad isn't doing anything while knowing I'm in this hell hole? Cut the crap and answer me. After you slept with her, did you fuck me or not? You were fucking another girl on my mother's birthday, and I can't even ask you this? Two or three... four times. Must have been hard on you. No, not really. You know I work out regularly, especially my lower body... This is a set up! I'm sorry I cheated on you. But you know me. I'm not a killer! Of course not. But didn't she ask you to get a divorce? Didn't you wish she would just disappear? Sweetie, what are you saying? How could you have sex in that situation? How did you get it up while wishing she'd be gone? Why are you acting like a monster? Did you put me up to this? Do you have a boyfriend? You've completely lost your mind. You think this impacts only my life? What about your family? I can have interviews in all the magazines about how crazy your family really is! Or I could just kill myself! Kill yourself, then. You don't have the balls... Look. Look. See? Let go of me! Let me die! - Professor! - Let go of me! I'm going to kill myself! Let me die! Take him away. Message: We caught the real killer. Hello? Did you send me the text? Yes, Mrs. KIM. How Worried you must be. Excuse me, who is this? I am an admirer of your husband. I will help professor anyway I can. What is this noise? This noise? It's nothing. Let's just call it, art work. Mr. PARK... You staring at me and smiling I was happy to see your face I hope this lasts for long I hope everytime I wake up I see you like this and I smile Mr. PARK... Jung-hoon, I mean, Officer KIM! Aren't you full of surprise! What is the best thing about Korea? No guns! My friend who moved to the States told me that. He misses Korea. No guns meaning, no worries walking around late even when you meet a stranger. What kind of a cop brings a gun... does it even work? That looks like a toy. Calm down... Give me back my CDs and hard drives. Of course. You can have them. Mr. HAN, you okay? Man, the gun worked! Works just fine. Is it hand crafted? Officer, I think we might have made a mistake, right? Min-tee, beg for forgiveness! Come on! I'm so sorry. On your knees! Be polite, man! Don't even think about it. I want my CDs and hard drives. Sure, but officer... I'm sorry, too, so I'm just going to kneel down... Stay still! I told you to stay still! Calm down... What's wrong with him? Is he dead? Of course not. Min-tee, get up! You're okay, right? I never harmed anyone! But Why! You killed Ji-na. You ruined everything! Sir, let's be civilized. Let's use our words, okay? Don't worry about him. He trained in Judo for three years. You know, they give you credit when entering the police academy if you hold a black belt or... I'm hit! I'm hit! Oh man, that hurt. Where are my CDs and hard drives? They're in the car trunk... Keys? In my pocket, but... I can't move my hands... This is your knife, you bastard! Eun-young! Call an ambulance. Don't you want your tip? Hey! High school grad! Why are you here? Why are you naked? Did Ji-na really like that professor? How would I know that? Crazy fucker! Here, we're here! I can't see... You're professor KIM's wife, right? Thank god. How do you know my husband? He's a client of my company. What happened here? You see that naked guy? He's the real killer. I caught him. Why don't you explain? You look the most sane here. Mrs. KIM, please... Call me an ambulance. I think I've lost too much blood. Blood, like 4 liters.Or 4 kg. What did you say? I couldn't hear you. Bring him here... Bring the DA to me. I received many calls, but I've really been busy. DA Lim... Yes. I'll admit to all charges. Sir, but... Ji-na, I'm sorry... I think I killed you, Ji-na. You can't do this... Where are you, Ji-na? No one's here for me. Ji-na! Professor! Hey! The investigation is still going on. We've found more prints and hair from the scene. No. I did it. I will ask yes or no questions. Defendant, did you kill your girlfriend KIM Ji-na on June 20, 2012? I think so... You can't answer like that. Defendant, did you kill your girlfriend KIM Ji-na on June 20, 2012? Yes, I did it. I killed her! So no one has really done anything wrong. You tapped in to her life, but didn't hurt her. You killed her out of love, You charge ridiculous interest but tried to catch the real killer. Why don't you make up and call it even? What about the professor? He can go to jail for his sins. But he hasn't done anything wrong? Are you two on the outs? Think about your children. They must be teenagers by now... I don't have any children. I'm sorry, I didn't know... Phone-tapper, what do you think? Do you want to reconcile with them? He killed Ji-na, He tormented her with money. They don't know what they've done wrong. Shut up, you pig. You killed my man. He was like a son to me. You don't even deserve a hanging. Mrs. KIM, please. Call me an ambulance. What about you? Want to reconcile? I'm going to die anyway, so I don't care. But the sinners must be punished. What makes you so innocent? You ruined her! You psycho! You killed her. Bastard, you killed my niece... You sold her voice tapes! Thanks to you tapping in to her life! I lost my 50 grand. Mrs. KIM, they're crazy. Wait a second! You have a short temper. I will reconcile with them. I'm sorry... You guys could be like younger brothers to me. I will give up on my money. As an older person, I should have held back. I'm sorry.
