I'll close the door. Go take a shower. I'll help you. I miss you. I miss you too. Maybe we should stop. No. Did we say that? Didn't you say that? I don't think so. Out of sight, out of mind? Enough of your mom's theory. I have to do my makeup. Hi! Hi, there! Did you sleep well? You shoot pictures of one another? You should knock, next time. Pictures like that travel on the web nowadays. - They never go away. - Stop! It's not your business. You're an adult now, but I still care. They're erotic videos. Who? What? Let's do lunch. We have to talk. Today, I can't. We'll talk tonight, then. Darn it! Tonight, I can't. We'll talk over the weekend. We'll take the time. By the time she finds time, she'll forget what it's about. That's disgusting. Shut up, porn queen! You're not my mom. GONE WILD Hello, Lucie. - You OK? - Hello. Who's she? It's Jeanne Moreau. Women are a sensitive issue. Especially women... In '67 and '68... Big problem. Mini-skirts are a mid-thigh length, but butt-length when women get into a taxi. I'm not a Puritan, but that's revolutionary. - A sign of our times. - Yes. Brigitte created a mythology of women. It didn't last. She was a free thinker, but she wasn't really free. When Brigitte played a character in a movie, she was always carefree, but she was a kept woman. She was never independent, never really free. I wanted to show a truly free woman who looks after herself, one who works and doesn't depend on anyone. Not on society, on a man, on an ideology, on a religion. That's what I wanted young people to see. Lucie! Lucie! Is your name Lucie? Come see this. - What is it? - Just come. Look. She looks like you. - Her? Think so? - Yep! Maybe. What are you working on? A special show. All the stars that appeared on TV since the beginning. Me, the 50-year anniversary of women's right to vote. I studied social sciences, so it's all familiar. You study law? Only 50 years? Yes. You didn't know? No. Politics and me... Why vote, anyway? Men had inhibitions... What do you mean? They allowed women to vote. They didn't realize... "Allowed?" Just kidding! Don't burn your bra. I don't wear one. Bitch! Don't spit it out. You feel like having some? I'd like to hit that bitch. Let her go! - You won't get it. - I will. He'll rape... I could fuck her... If you weren't so ugly... - Ciao, Jess! - Ciao! - We'll text each other. - Bye, Jo. Is that Jessica under the guy? Doesn't she need help? She's just flirting. - Get up, you! - Your friends aren't normal. - You look terrible. - You too. - Don't start! - You neither. Cup the crap! The 3 of us... Move, jerk! Too much traffic. We left late. Ah, mom! I feel sick. Didn't you stop? Never start. I'm hungry! We'll spend two days just eating. - Leave it open! - It's freezing. Close it! Oh, the cake! I forgot it in the office. And the champagne too. Shit. - Girls, I freeze seriously. - Mom! I forgot everything. Incredible! You are poorly organized. Don't think you're special because you're doing a paid internship. You complain all the time. You have to study. Two years from now, you can get a job. It'll look good on your resumé. In a law firm, not TV. - I don't like law. - You chose. I didn't push you. Stay out of it. The study period is shorter. All you need is a good memory. The shortest study period and a princess's job. Exactly. I'll be a cashier. You're out at 7 PM. You buy cookies cheap. Silly goose! Look, Lucie, she believes me. Mommy. "My daughter a cashier? No way!" With the company you keep, that's a real possibility. What's your problem? Grandma? My darlings! I thought you'd never come. I'm hungry. Malou! Say "Hello, Grandma. How are you?" Put your things down. Go freshen up. Malou, I made you a gift for me. A new dress on the bed for the party. Nice of you not to help... Merry Christmas, my gift of love. It's tomorrow, Mom. I have gift suggestions at the office, but that's all they had. Who buys carnations? Lucky me! People will know I buy flowers at the gas station. Aurore, you're always rushing. I'll put the dessert in the fridge. From the gas station also. It's OK. I got it in case... Your dad loves ice cream. What flavor is it? Cardamom. But it's never the right flavor. - Where's your friend? - Max? He's my lover. I want to have fun, not iron his clothes. You enjoy being alone that much? I love my daughters. I can't say anything. There you are. Nice to see you. - Join me for a drink. - I will. Aurore, do the girls like vegetables? Of course, Mom, as always. She's never tired? She has new batteries. I can't keep up. Here! Each year, we follow this stupid tradition. We're not 10 anymore. - It's been 40 years. - Lousy tradition! Here we are! Malou's at the piano. Bravo! It's nice. No, Malou, no! You'll get fat. They're made to eat. - Thanks. - Thanks, Dad. Lucie... What's with her? She worked hard today. That's good. Learning a job is learning about life. Certainly not! She has to concentrate on her studies. It's hard enough as it is. Lucy's very smart. She can do both. At her age, you were a studying mother. Your dad and I looked after Lucie. It's not the same. Lucie doesn't have to work. She's not short of money. It's crazy! I'm being trained for TV work. I check the archives to help the researchers. - You didn't tell me. - You never listen. What did you discover today? Some very enlightening stuff. Everybody smoked in those days. - Fascinating! - Get lost! They were always demonstrating. A bunch of moaners. I saw something weird. In one of the pictures, a girl was demonstrating and she looked like me. - Really? - She looked just like me. You must be mistaken. Are you OK, Grandma? You cut yourself. A girl who looks like you? Old movies... You're mistaken. I'm not saying we're twins... But she looked familiar. You enjoy looking at old-fashioned blunders? You're young. Look at the future. A moment ago, you said I was lucky to have a job. I'll do what I want. You can't do what you want. Nobody does what they want. Especially not a girl like you who doesn't respect her mother. Listen, Dad... Are you OK, Mom? What's wrong? It's just an old tree ornament. It was the nicest one. Grandpa's gone overboard. Forget it! That picture you saw... You've been cloned and no one should know. Maybe I'm the clone. Maybe I'm an android. No father, no mother. No heart. I'm just a machine. A tickling machine. Stop! You're scaring me. Stop it! What is it? It's Tom. Those carols irritate me. That's Christmas at our place. My sister enjoying a smoke. Here's something different. Stop that! - Gimme! - No. Gimme! Do you have the matching bra? You'll have to wait until it fits... let them grow. Keep your trap shut! Never mind. Will you give it back? You are so stupid, with your bullshit messages. You've split up. Do you have to smoke? We share this bedroom, mind you. I feel sick. Genevieve? Grandma... It's me. It's Lucie. I know it's you, my fairy. Go to bed, Santa is coming. - Good night. - Good night. Do you have a stomach ache? I vomited all I ate. The atmosphere made you puke. Draw something on my back. Grandma called me "Geneviève." No, "Genève." "Geneviève." Alzheimer. Completely. Here! For the safe. Thanks, Grandma. A safe investment. It's for you. Thanks. Thanks, Grandma. - Mom, I have a job... - It's not from me. It's from me. Buy whatever you want. Listen to your mom. Concentrate on your studies. She doesn't need money. Is there something you need? I'd like to go see Thomas in New York. Mom's against it. You didn't ask me. So? You're not going to New York. She's obsessed with that guy. At her age, there should be 100 guys flirting with her. She's in love. You want her to sleep around instead? Absolutely. It's my turn to sit in the front. See you soon! Thank you. I'll call you. Robin? Robin! - You're working during the Holidays? - Yes. What are you doing here? Could you show me that girl who looks like me? - You said she doesn't. - Come on! Please... In the army, you have to see and not be seen. But here it's important to be seen, not to see. - Is that all? - Yes. Anything else? Yes, otherwise it wouldn't be an excerpt. You sound like my sister. How can I view the rest? - Debug it. - Say it in French... I know you have your degree. Documents and Archives, first floor. Give them this reference number. Thanks. Did you have a nice Christmas? Where's D plus A? - Right next door. - Thanks. Closed until January 4th. - January 4th? - Right. What do you need? Current Affairs. They need the whole movie, not just an excerpt. - I've seen you before. - I'm in training. I thought you were the new host for the news bulletin. I warn you: it's freezing. M... X... 00138301. Bring it back. I'm in the corner office. I live here... The creativity they're seeking today... If we have those things... ...meeting that will take place after the workshops. In room 38. Thank you. I'm comrade de Collonges. I'll speak about women's lib, not about women. De Collonges? I'm comrade de Collonges. I'll speak about women's lib, not about women. I don't get it. She looks like me, has Grandma's name... There are billions. Try "comrade" or "women's lib." You mean, "Mother I'd Like to Fuck"? No, that's MILF. There are other F words than "fuck." Same as WLF: Women's liberation Front. Click on "Comrade de Collonges." There. Geneviève de Collonges, "Tout va bien" magazine. Geneviève... It's her. I'm sure. At Christmas, remember? Grandma called me "Geneviève." You thought she meant "Genève." She knows her. Let's call her. Grandpa? May I speak to Grandma, please. Grandpa, do you know who Geneviève is? - De Collonges. - No. Does Grandma know? She's sleeping. I'm sure she knows her. - I know her family well. - Who is it? No one named Geneviève. Bye, Lucie. Switzerland is one of the few developed countries where women can't vote. - Do you often play cards here? - Yes, often. - When you're here, where's your wife? - She stays home. Like all women, she cleans the house, looks after the kids. What's your opinion on women's right to vote? It's nonsense! You're not in favor either? No, sir, not at all. What about a women being elected Member of Parliament? I don't think so. I head the League of Swiss Women Against Female Voters. Why are you against female voters? I'm against that because women shouldn't have the same rights and the same duties as men. A woman's right to vote goes against the status of women. Basically, women should have the right to vote. It's urgent. It's a huge issue that women still can't vote. It's understandable, but unjustifiable. A woman's right to vote is important because it proves that men respect women and respect one's personality even if it's a woman. It's the essential thing. How come you're still in your pajamas? I'll call you back. Jerk! Malou, Malou... You're not sleeping? I have gastroenteritis. You don't have a fever. Did you puke? You ate too much at Grandma's. Drink flat coke. - Mom... - What? Does "Geneviève de Collonges" mean anything to you? Geneviève? No. Maybe one of Grandma's cousins? I don't know the family... Flat coke. Loan me some money. Why not? You have a job. You're mean. You on your period? Think you're old enough to know? You take advantage... Stupid! Who is it? Turkish delight... What can I do, Miss Trainee? Thanks. I didn't find what I was looking for. I watched the whole thing. Didn't find anything. The whole thing? You overdid it! Your interface is a mess. I'll remember that. They've asked me to watch... all there is on women's right to vote and women's lib. All the videos for that period. All the cassettes? For Current Affairs... Let's go get them. - I like the odor, here. - I don't smell it anymore. It's vinegar. It's murder for acetate. We must digitize everything before it's all gone. Save 8,000 hours worth of film. They used rolls of film in those days, not cassettes. Cassettes came later. That's another 8,000 hours. I won't tell you about magnetic tape. Current Affairs isn't aware of that? How can I watch them? You can't watch them. Why? These archives haven't been digitized yet. We don't know what treasures most of them hold. A whole country's memories going to pieces. Those idiots have gone skiing while vinegar is eating away. Trainees don't do overtime the way Current Affairs does. What should I do? Make do with the database and the site. Why bring me here, then? You're persistent. You wouldn't have believed we don't have what you want. And I thought you'd be interested. I am. Excuse me. Go on! I'll lock up. Hi, businesswoman! Nice of you to study with your old pals. If no cute guys are in there, we'll go for coffee. It's as dreary as it's empty. - I need to pee. I'll catch up. - We're girls too. We'll come. How's the TV training? - Lucie, got a tampon? - No. Here, poor girl! Thanks, Swiss girl! It's in the instructions in case of atomic war? 3 kilos of rice, 2 boxes of tampons... - I want it back. - Though I've used it? You're disgusting! You guys don't have your period? We're not in synch anymore? We should meet more often. PREGNANT Oh, gosh! I have rotten periods. I get very grouchy. You have your period every day? Not funny! What... - I miss Tom. - Poor darling. Hello? Where are you? What floor are you on? Near the fir tree? OK. I can see you. Wait there, Grandma. I'm coming. Grandma, it's me, Lucie. Why did you hang up? I thought I'd die. Come... They pretend they can't see me. They want to choke me. Don't worry about it, Grandma. I know what I'm saying. Don't you contradict me too! Do you need anything? It's me, Lucie. She doesn't exist. Many people have the name de Collonges. She looks like me. Look! It's bad for your eyes. At my age, you'll be wearing glasses. It's not really possible. Please... Lucie, my feet hurt. You found her... Geneviève? Who is she? Grandma... My little sister. Sit down. I want to go home. Come to the tramway stop with me. You have a sister? I want to go home. - How come we don't know her? - She's no longer with us. You look like her. Same personality too. You're strong, like her. No, I'm not. You don't know it yet. You'll see. What's wrong, darling? I'm pregnant. I love that baby already. A gift of love. I'm there for you. I was there for your mom. I'm always there. Grandpa... I'm looking for pictures of Grandma's sister. I saw her in archive pictures. - How come we have no pictures of her? - You're talking nonsense. Grandpa, why are you lying? Jacqueline lost her sister when she was 20. It was extremely painful. Why pretend she never existed? Your grandma's very frail. This is very serious. Don't mention her sister to her anymore. Alright. Don't take those archives too seriously. That woman's talked a lot of crap on TV. We want all forms of slavery to be abolished. All forms of hierarchy. The pill has freed women from slavery. All young women should have access to it. We're fighting against all forms of slavery: from religion, from family, from sex... No more unwanted pregnancies. We're no longer motherhood slaves. Without motherhood, there are no humans. A woman's body must stop being a baby factory. Then there'll be equality. What? What's the matter? Nothing. Oh, my gosh! Lucie, is this yours? Whose is it? It's mine. - Phew! - Phew? I thought it was Malou's. "Phew" it is. Don't be stupid. You can't compare. I'll help you, honey. Don't worry. We'll call the gynecologist and take care of this. How many weeks are you? Must be before Thomas left. Is it Thomas? Who do you think I am? You can get some with anyone you want. Do you have to put it that way? Having cybersex isn't the same as making love. Waiting for me to come home? You called my PC 24 times and my answering machine 10 times. I can't go on like this. I feel like I'm a married man. Your mother was right. What's next? - Lucie... - Thomas, the last time we... We didn't use... You didn't use... You mean a condom? Are you sure? I withdrew... I'm sorry. I don't know... Don't cry. Don't cry, Luciole. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I feel... We talked about it. We even chose names. Maxence. Charlotte. We were just kidding... Yes and no. Meaning? We're not kidding anymore. Five minutes ago, you said it was all over. That girl yesterday... I didn't know where this was going. But now... It's great, Lucie. Perfect. Come here while I'm studying for my master's. We'll get an apartment. Don't panic. I'll make money. I have a job waiting. You'll stay home with the baby. Make room for me. You have an appointment with the gynecologist at 3 PM tomorrow. She'll explain how it's done. Want me to be there? I should decide for myself about the baby. The baby? There's no baby in just 4 weeks. You always criticize. It's my life. Having a baby at 19 is hell. That's what you did. Regret it? I should slap you. It's very hard to raise a child alone. Tom's reliable. How can you be sure? You've been with 1 irresponsible guy so far. You don't know men. You never stay with the same guy very long. That's no life for me. Thanks. It's like doing something illegal. I love it! Thanks. I'll have it renewed. You're on a secret mission for what government? If I tell you, you'll become a target. I won't do that. You care that much? Oh, please... During the Holidays. I'll be in training. She'll be back before I'm done training you. Watching movies isn't hard to do. They must be handled with care. And you're already in training. I'm off during the Holidays. After that, I can switch places. I can work for you 8 days. I'm really interested. It's against protocol. So is that. There! Your turn, now. Time to synchronize. First, the picture. Turn the sound off. Right! Move ahead slowly till you see the X. Keep going. Stop! Now go back. Stop! It's OK. Now, the sound. Cut the picture and move ahead. Slow till you hear the beep. Keep going... Now sound and picture together. There! Make sure those pins are closed before you move on or you'll cause a national disaster. Now start! Let's go, young lady! Stop. Stop! It's torn. We'll fix it with scotch tape, otherwise we can't digitize it. What do we do? It has to stay flat. Very easy. Now, the rest of the reel could tear too. You're a fast worker because you're young. OK, Lucie. You're hired on a trial basis. But don't mess up. If you damage these movies, it will be a national disaster. I know. You told me 100 times. Now it's 101 times. I was there. Unbelievable! Geneva, 1968. The Living Theater. I was 22. Incredible! Natural law: a woman went along with whatever her husband did. Not me. If you came all the way from Saillon for this, get lost! Paragraph 160. The husband is the master in a marriage. He chooses the place of residence and takes proper care of his wife and children. If a woman wants to be free, she should remain single. She'll be free. No one can force her to get married. We can't amend the laws pertaining to marriage so a married woman will be free to do as she pleases. Young people have invented the collective marriage. Instead of marrying one person, you marry 15 people. You say 15, but it can be more. - 13 or... - 17? Yes. It depends on the number of friends you have, the number of people you want to live with. As a rule, does it work well? Yes. Love and kisses... on the belly. - Why are you yelling? - I was almost crushed. Funny! You don't give a damn about the archives. You pretend you care a lot? What are you looking for? My great-aunt. I saw her in some old movies and I'm sure she's in others. You're not paid to do research for yourself. I know. I'm sorry. All these reels and cassettes have to be digitized now before they fall apart. They're our country's memory. So your research... That woman's my family's memory. That's important too. Do you just care about your job, your country, this damn network? More about that than what's-her-name. Her name's Geneviève de Collonges. Unbelievable! Now I know: that's who you look like. You know who she is? Skinheads? Alcoholics Anonymous. She was a member. - Me too, but later. - Now we live as a community. We work for companies that we founded ourselves. We practice free love, i.e. there are no married couples. What's going on? Free love. A different partner every night. Never-ending sex. No rules. Free... for men only. This AA commune was founded in 1970 in Vienna by Austrian artist Otto Mühl to mix art and life, and create in a social lab the illusion of a counter-society. Every night, members try to produce a primal scream that will set them free from mother-related neurosis. Is she sick? She's doing an SD: selbst darstellung, therapy through action. Unbelievable! You were involved? We thought these social cells would revolutionize the world. By multi-fucking? Younger folks are so prudish! Marriage is obsolete. It's her. They're middle-class ideas to enslave women as housekeeping whores serving men and their offspring. We reserve the right to practice free love. No price, no burden, no life. She's like my mother. She hates men. No, that's not the point. She wanted to be free. Your life wouldn't be the same if it hadn't been for them. Go to bed, honey. All right? Come on, go! Say... why didn't you put them in a vase? I'm not her maid. She bugs me with that love affair. Where is she? I don't care about that fancy-ass. Shit! I'm your mother. Thomas? I need your help. Lucie's going bonkers with that unwanted pregnancy. You're responsible too. I'll take my responsibilities. I'll marry her. - You'll what? - Marry her. Mom? Are you both crazy? Getting married and having a baby as a fantasy? There's really a baby on the way. Please, Tom... Lucie should have an abortion. - Lucie! - Mom... Go away. What is she talking about? We're not like that. We're in love. If you love a girl, use a condom, swine! Mom! Smarten up, Lucie. How dare you! You're not telling me anything. You hide things. It scares me. Do you tell me everything? You don't hide things? Grandma told me. She said I came unexpectedly and you didn't want to get married. You re-live your past through me. That's how it is. You wanted to get an abortion... I could have... Could or should? You're old enough to understand. I don't regret the hardships. How can you say that? You're a monster! I'm just being a mother. You don't believe me... That's what you want? Think you can teach me to be a mother? Just look at you! Two daughters, and two fathers who left or were thrown out. Your mother took care of us. You're never home, just working. Think you know what a mother is? Sleeping isn't enough. Over there. - Hi! - Hello. See you! You prefer oldies? I meant movies. You like that job? A new pass. You never answer personal questions. Some crappy old rockers are playing at L'usine tonight. Since you like oldies... No way! I'm getting tired of oldies. You had an abortion? Termination of pregnancy. It's legal. What were your reasons? Basically, I didn't want to have children at the time, to take that responsibility. I had other plans. I really didn't want to raise children back then. It's the Health Minister's turn to speak. Mr. President, Members of Parliament. I'm speaking before you today as Health Minister and as an ordinary woman to ask those in office to approve basic amendments to abortion laws. First, I'd like to talk about something women believe in. I apologize for doing so before a predominantly male audience. Women are never happy to have an abortion. You'll know if you listen to them. It's always tragic. It is and will always be tragic. France, a human rights advocate, sends women to Geneva to get abortions. What do you think of that? Don't forget abortion is only legal in a few Swiss townships. Rich women can afford it, but keep it a secret. Less fortunate women do without. It's unfair, hypocritical. We should do something about laws, not ethics. If men became pregnant, they'd care as much about the fetus as about their foreskin. Those 343 sluts who signed the manifesto, you know them? All of us had abortions. That's the real situation. You're in denial. That's why women are dying even today. Give her the phone, Grandpa. I must speak to her. She took her medication. You see? Don't you see? What you told her about that woman affected her. She harmed us. As far as I'm concerned, she's gone. Dead! She's still living? We haven't seen her for 40 years. Where is she? I couldn't care less. I think your boobs got bigger. They're like mine. What? Lighten up! What are you gonna do? Tom wants to marry me. Darn it, no! Don't marry him 'cause of a rubber mishap. - He didn't use one. - You have years to make babies. Can't you side with us? If she wants to get married and have children, why put her down? When you make mistakes, we stay off your back. I understand her. I'll get some air. Thanks. - She mustn't keep the baby. - It's a human life. A cluster of cells, like a beauty spot. - No, it even has nails. - Stop it! I don't care what you think. I've heard all the remarks. It's just theory. It's different now that it's inside me. If I don't keep it, my mom will be happy. If I keep it, Thomas will be happy. What about me? After 5 weeks, it has to be a vacuum extraction. Not very painful, but some women find it harder emotionally. You must see a doctor, but the law says it's your decision. I'll think about it. Do it fast. I think you're 4 weeks. No smoking, drinking or doing drugs. Just in case. Is there someone else? Maybe the baby's not even mine. You're really stupid! If it's my baby, how dare you have it ejected? I'm not a baby factory! I'm not a piece of equipment! How can you think that way? - I have to go. - Tom, don't... I'll hang up, maybe talk to you later. In the Federal German Republic... ...try their hands at it. They set a store on fire in Frankfurt. Group leaders get their guerilla and terrorism training... ...hold-ups. They get money... ...of the group were already in jail, but their leaders were free. MAYBE MORE PICTURES OF G. No! It can't break! Shit! Ah, shit! Ruining archives documents, that's unforgivable. I'm sorry. It's my fault. I'll tell the woman in charge. You're not in charge? It's against my principles to be someone's boss. As far as you're concerned, you're training's over. Current Affairs will be glad you're back. So, don't take it so hard. Nobody wants to tell me where Geneviève is. How will I find her? Is it important? Did you watch the reels I picked for you? She wasn't on them. Lucie, you don't understand. The Red Brigades: Geneviève disappeared during the Milan terrorist attack. She took up arms. That's the reason... We reserve the right to practice free love. No price, no burden, no life. Marriage is obsolete. You traded a dusty place for a brightly lit one? It made me sick. - Is it contagious? - Very much so. Hope I'll catch it! Tomorrow night, I'm going to a concert. A new group. They're very cool. Want to come? Yes. - Yes? - Yes. I'm going for a smoke. They were really free. They slept around like sluts. - You'd have liked her? - No. She's changed a lot since. A strawberry mark. Can't miss it. You know her? Not personally, but I know who she is. - I want to meet her. - Go to the fish market. She works there. Shall we go smoke again? I'm pregnant. - Here! - Thanks. Excuse me. I'm looking for a lady, about 60 years old. She has a... Elsa? Come! Do you know where she is? If you do, please tell me. Give me 2 minutes. I'm her niece. Did you know her well? What was she like? An outstanding woman, very strong and loyal. Not sentimental. She practiced what she preached. You see? Yes, I see. The Red Brigades. Absolutely not. Just idealistic. She was against violence. Why did she leave, then? I don't know. She disappeared after she had her child. A child? Hard to believe... Geneviève a mother? It happened. Do you know anything else? No one wants to tell me the truth. But you were her friend. You loved her. I feel as if I were looking right at her. Come! Come on! Mom? - Where are you? - Grandma's at the psychiatric hospital. Lucie, what did you tell her about a sister? Geneviève is Grandma's sister and she's alive. Really? - I saw her on the archive pictures. - She hates archives. My mom's in a mental hospital. Should you be there too? Mom, do you realize what I'm saying? - Geneviève's alive. - Where is she? That's enough! Stop it! Keep your mouth shut. Let's go see Grandma. Me too. I'll talk to her. Sorry! Doctors forbid it. See you later. I don't want to go. Leave me alone! I don't want to go back there. Let me go. I don't need that crap! Let me go. It's chemistry. I've always told you women are bad chemists. I've been taking medication for a long time. The dose had to be adjusted. - Meaning what? - Malou, get us some drinks. Here! Good news: she'll probably be out later today. I was afraid I'd finish the year or start the new year in here. Mommy, come with me. You've done enough harm already. That's enough! Stop! Grandma, did Geneviève have a baby? Stop making up stories. Go away! - Who's the child? - She gave her to me. Lucie, she's not well. It's mom? My gift of love. My precious gift of love. Mom... She makes up stories. She's in shock. Mom, you don't understand. No... Come on, Dad... We haven't done anything wrong. You're our daughter. We raised you as if you were our child. Wait... Geneviève's the one at fault. Don't harm your mom. Wait! Bye! I don't understand. Give me... We must find her, Mom. You must meet her. No. I have a mother: it's Jacqueline. Gimme. Gimme! - I'm going too. - No, you're not. She's my real grandma too. You need to look after Mom. I'm going or else I'll scream and you won't go either. OK, then. Forgive me. We've gone to find Geneviève. 3, 4, 5... Why did she let Grandma take Mom away from her? That's strange. Does she know we exist? I said you could come along, not bug me. It's strange. She has a baby and gives it to her sister. She's 100 km away and nobody hears from her again. I don't get it. That's why we're going to ask her. Now, shut up. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... How old were you the first time? - What? - You made... How old were you? - Made love? - Yeah... How do you call it? - It's not something dirty. - I know. What do you know? Forget it! I don't care when you got fucked and by whom. Two months after I turned 17. Ask me some questions. That's what big sisters are for. What are kid sisters for? Nothing at all. We should have phoned her. Where? We don't have her address. Give me the map. I'm freezing. We'll be spending New Year's Day in the woods. I'm fed up. Why are we here looking for a ghost? "Flight ticket reservation confirmed. "Geneva - New York..." ...I love you. Thomas. He's an angel. He's right: it's better to make a baby with someone you love. There are billions of other things to do. Shut up! You're too young to know. You've never loved anyone. When I do, I don't want to marry the guy because I didn't use any protection. You're only 13! If you were my age... Your age? Poor baby! A teenage mom who thinks she's an adult. Disgusting! You're stupid! We're going back. I have a plane to catch. Go on, you can leave! Don't forget to wear an apron and a garter belt. Lucie! They left? To go where? The girls are not responding. Where does that woman live? Where are they? My gift of love. We don't know where she is and we don't want to know. - She's a bad woman. - Why? Why the secrecy? So all of you can live in peace. Can't you see it's worse? Pregnant at 19. She didn't even know who your father was. My father... 19 years old. Not like me. Like Lucie? You had no right. Why didn't she keep me? Aurore, that woman's crazy. Raging mad. A junkie and an anarchist. Dangerous! We saved you. Tell her, Jacqueline. My gift of love. Think it's here? Geneviève! - Malou... - What? Geneviève! Geneviève! Geneviève! Where the hell are you? Who's that yelling? Geneviève? Little girls... Well, well... - Can I ride? - Come on! Did you really have bombs? That's what they say? No. Why did you leave, then? You're quite straightforward. We have a lot to talk about. Let's skip the formalities. - Malou! - The girl's right. Let's not beat around the bush. Why did you have Mom? It's a bit complicated by today's standards. I guess you've changed... That's right. My sister couldn't have children. I made one for her. - What did the father say? - There was no father. It made things simpler. I had several love affairs and I became pregnant with that child. - I gave it to my sister. - That's all? That's the reason? The best reason to have a child is to want one. Why leave? Because it was too tough to give a child away? - Because it was too easy... - Meaning? You can't understand. I'm pregnant. My sister... didn't believe me. Guess she thought she was doing me a favor by taking my baby, as I was stupid to give it to her. She can speak. She's with the crazies. It was a mistake to think society was ready. I was an idealist. I thought I could have an abortion and then forget it or make babies for others. Meaning what? Now, you should come back. Your mom's my sister's daughter. It was a political choice and a personal one. A woman thing. She didn't even tell her husband. For them, it's unthinkable. But I can't pretend. I take responsibility, but not them. You can't change that. That's bullshit! Act as if nothing had happened. We're not in the '70s anymore. A child came, then 2 girls... Maybe a grandchild on the way... That's no political discourse. I don't know... I don't need that. Let's go, Malou. Too bad! You'd get along well with my mother. You're just like her. How far would you go to help me? To the moon. Would you give me one of your livers? Yes. But to give a child... That's something! It's a hell of a gift! Happy birthday! Open it! It's a girl! Thanks! Very nice of you! So you're not finishing the year in the hospital, right? Let's have a drink to celebrate the new year. We'll make a fresh start. She's frail. She could die. I can't believe it! After all we did for you... Raise your daughter as if she were our child... How dare you? That's not it. Darling, you couldn't father a child. It's nobody's business. Geneviève gave us a gift, the best gift there is. Why... didn't you ever tell anyone? Darling... You see why you're a gift of love? Thanks. Why didn't they tell me? Was my father ashamed to be sterile? They always tried to look like a perfect couple. I'm falling apart at the seams. Your parents wanted you, Aurore, but knew you could turn out to be just like me. That's what your daughters said. My daughters? I've no idea where they are. I'm a bad mother. Not worse than me. - Sis... - What? - I'll have an abortion. - Why? Dunno. Maybe I'm a feminist... Like Geneviève. I want to be free. Are you stupid? You're all mixed up. Don't follow an ideology. Make your own choices. That's what women's lib is all about. A hands-on approach to life. Do you want this baby or not? I don't care to look after a baby. You're really grounded, girls. Even on New Year's Day. Now go! Wait! It's all over now. Hey, you! I don't care if you get lost. Your dad and I will make another boy just like you. 5... 4... 7... 6... Come on! ENTRY CANCELLED Hi, there! We're in 2009, a very sympathetic year. Think she cares? She's studying history instead, now. Enough! It's nice of me to come this far to meet you at this darn school. We know why you're here. 'Cause guys who study literature speak well, but they're cheap. Guys who study law spend money. Exactly. I came back to find a rich husband. Seriously... We should let men pay. And blush a little, let them drive... Right! Most of all, don't let them get rough in bed. Translation: TV5 Québec Canada
