Improved & Synced by BanglarBagh RACHEL: The Second Amendment isn't just obsolete. It's dangerous. ANDY: I totally get why you think that. I'm sorry, I've just never known someone who's into guns before. I'm not into guns, Rachel. I have a couple. More than the one. That doesn't mean that I'm a fanatic. Okay, it doesn't mean that I'm not for restrictions and waiting periods and background checks. (CLEARS THROAT) So what does it mean, Andy? I just wanna be able to protect myself. From what, exactly? You googled me. Yeah, I did. Fucking Internet. You have a very dark past. Yeah. So why didn't you tell me? Because I like you. I didn't wanna scare you away. I was six. My babysitter was murdered. (SCREAMS) Along with my teacher and my caseworker and 37 other people over the years... That I'm aware of. And they never caught him? Put it this way, justice was done. - CHUCKY: Wait! - Play with this. (GUNSHOT) Look, Andy, I think you're a nice guy, but, uh, this is just too much for me. (EXHALES SOFTLY) I get it. I should go. (EXHALES SOFTLY) Ah. (SIGHS) (GASPS) I guess it's just me and you again tonight, pal. (EXHALES SHARPLY) (COUGHS) Give me a hit off that, will you? (INHALES SHARPLY) (GRUNTS) Ah! (LAUGHS) You wanna play? Let's play. What about Rachel? Didn't she wanna play? Now we'll never know if she's a natural redhead. (LAUGHS) Face it, Andy. I'm all you've got. Sometimes, it's nice, just hanging out on a Friday night with your best friend. Fuck you! (SCREAMING) (HIGH-PITCHED TONE) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (GRUNTING) Again. (HIGH-PITCHED TONE) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (GRUNTING) I thought you said she was paralyzed. She is. That's just the juice. (NICA BREATHING HEAVILY) See? From the waist down, she's a pincushion. All right, that's enough. NICA: I can still see him in my nightmares. His twisted face, that horrible laugh, the glint off his blade, the screams of his victims. Whose victims, Nica? The murders were real. You know that. But Chucky never was. That's right. He was a fantasy. A delusion. He was a mask I wore so I could go on looking in the mirror, so I could live with myself. And now, when you look in the mirror, what do you see? I don't look. DR. FOLEY: You'll have to, if you're ever gonna learn to forgive yourself. Nica, you've made tremendous progress. In the past four years, you've had to accept some hard truths about yourself. That is very brave. I'm proud of you. I'm having you transferred to Harrogate. That's medium security, Nica. That means more privacy, more independence, more freedom, within reason, of course... Dr. Foley, what I did was unforgivable. Schizophrenia is an illness. By definition, and according to the law, you weren't responsible for your actions. Do you think Alice would accept that as an apology for making her an orphan? Are there no cameras? Not in medium security. But don't abuse the privilege. Bathroom's back there. Shower's handicap-friendly, but if you need help, ask for Ashley or Pam. They alternate days. Anything else, just let me know. My name's Carlos. Thanks for being so nice. Don't misunderstand. I'm not a fan. We're not gonna be friends. I'm just doing my job. Well, thank you anyway. You're welcome. (SNIFFS) You in an accident? I was born like this. My husband has MS. I'm sorry. I don't let it keep him from living his life. WOMAN: (ON PA) Dr. Foley, your assistance is needed in room two. Dr. Foley to room two, please. Excuse me. Can you see me? Yeah. Oh, thank God. None of the others can see me. Please don't be afraid. I'm not afraid of you. Good. I won't hurt you. I just need someone to talk to. I spent my whole life here. Then I died. Right here in this room... A long, long time ago. That's awful. - Angela, we can all see you. - (SCREAMS) Fuck you! (BREATHES RAPIDLY) Go haunt somebody else now. (WHIMPERS) Ah, she's harmless. They found her living on the street, like, 30 years ago, but I guess being dead's more exotic than being homeless. I don't know about that. Well, I've never been dead before, but I have been homeless, and it's pretty fucking colorless. I'm Michael. Nica. Do you wanna, uh... - Yeah. - Yeah? Where'd you get the gum? Oh, um, Carlos. Carlos? (CHUCKLES) Wow. You must have made quite the impression. Not really. No, he's kind of a hard-ass. But Nurse Ashley, she's my guardian angel. Wasn't for her, I'd still be in detox. (CHUCKLES LIGHTLY) So, uh, you just transferred? Yup. Where from? - Lochmoor. - Oh. Oh. Oh, you're that girl who... Yeah. You still have a thing for redheads? (LAUGHS) What? 'Cause the... This, you... No. Oh. Sorry. That's too soon. I'll trade you for a cigarette. Okay. Oh. Juicy Fruit. Mmm. Huh. (PANTING) (MOANING) (BOTH GRUNTING) - CLAIRE: So why'd you do it? - Claire. We're all wondering the same thing here, right? Give her a break, okay? She's new. Fuck that! If I'm gonna be living down the hallway from someone who butchered her whole family, I have a right to know what set her off. Well, why'd you burn your house down? You always bring that up. I'm just saying, if we're pointing fingers here, then... I didn't kill anyone. Neither did Nica. Chucky did it. (SCOFFS) I don't blame you for being afraid after what I did. I was very ill. Are you feeling better now? I understand your concerns, and, absolutely, we should talk about it, but, believe me, Nica isn't a danger to anyone anymore. And let's not forget, she isn't the only one here to benefit from an insanity plea. She's the only multiple murderer, though. Mass murderer, actually. There's a difference. Who cares? We're all sick. I wanna know why she killed them. I was pathologically jealous of my sister, and I was always too possessive of Alice, who is my niece. She's 12 now, and I'll never see her again. I only hope she's doing okay. ANGELA: She's not okay. Excuse me? Chucky told me. Angela. He called me. On the phone. He said to tell you he's coming for you... Now that you can have visitors. (CHUCKLES) (LAUGHS) You think this is funny? No. I don't. It's okay, Angie. It's okay. Okay, it was inevitable that this would come up. And it's important that we all explore it together as a group. I think I have something that will help. (IN GOOD GUY VOICE) Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play? Whoa! - Is that a... - It's just a Good Guy doll, one of thousands made back in the '80s. No, he said, "Chucky"! They had 50 different names. Two percent of them were "Chucky." - You're saying it's a coincidence? - Not at all. I paid for a Chucky. Where'd you get it? Hot Topic. Nica, this doesn't make you uncomfortable, does it? No, not at all. Oh, my God. What is it, Madeleine? He's my baby. (WHISPERS) Oh. Open up, sweetheart. Here comes the choo-choo. It's too hot for him. I like to be hugged. I can't believe he's talking already! Madeleine, stop it! Your baby is dead. You know that. What is your problem? Why can't you just let her be happy? You think that's the way to make her happy? Letting her play house with some psycho killer's trophy? (GASPS) - Give him back. - "Him"? That's an interesting choice of pronoun. Are you still having trouble separating reality from that sick shit in your head? No. Unfortunately, these days, reality is painfully clear. Now give him back. What are you gonna do, Nica? You gonna stab me? Cut my throat? Chop off my head? NICA: Don't be ridiculous. We don't even have access to real cutlery. The only thing I could get my hands on are the barbiturates they give me every morning that I've been stockpiling for months, waiting for the right bitch to come along to poison. Here. Thank you. - Sure. - Are you okay, Chucky? I'm Mark, by the way. It's nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. What? From Michael. He's in the pool right now, getting ready for Tokyo in 2020, but don't tell anyone. Michael Phelps? He's retired. Oh. Oh. God, this is embarrassing. I fucking hate it when this happens, especially around a pretty girl. It's actually one of my triggers. His real name is Malcolm. We call him Multiple Malcolm. Nobody calls me that. (EXHALES) Excuse me. Nica, you have a visitor. Nica, this is Ms. Valentine, your niece's legal guardian. You're Alice's guardian? That's right. I'm sorry, but you seem really familiar. Did anyone ever tell you, you look exactly like Jennifer Tilly? Yeah, I get that a lot. You're not quite what I expected, either. What did you expect? Somebody taller. You don't seem very dangerous. You don't seem very motherly. Huh. How is she? She's dead, Miss Pierce. What? Ms. Valentine, I wish you had told me. Oh, didn't I? (VOICE BREAKING) Uh, I'm terribly sorry. I've just been going through an awful ordeal. (SNIFFLES AND SOBS) But she's in a better place now, I know it. What happened? I'm no doctor, Miss Pierce, but I think it was a broken heart. (INHALES SHARPLY) (CRIES) She wanted you to have something. (IN GOOD GUY VOICE) Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play? - That's not the same... - No, no. This is the doll that they used in Alice's therapy. To help her get over the past. She thought that maybe it would help you, too. - There you go. - (WHIMPERS) Aw. That's so sweet. Well, thank you so much. Good luck. (INHALES) I can't... (SOBS) (WIND HOWLING) (KEYBOARD CLACKING) (THUNDER CRACKING) (FOOTSTEPS) Ah. Where's Nica? Last door on the right. You can see me. Yeah, I can see you. Don't be afraid. What? I'm not going to hurt you. (CHUCKLES) You fucking with me? No. I'm not. Tell you the truth, I'm happy to have the company, even if you aren't real. Okay, let me explain something to you. I am a vintage, mass-marketed children's toy from the '80s, standing right in front of you, holding a very sharp scalpel. No, you're not. Yes, I am. I'm a schizophrenic. I see things. Aren't you the crazy bitch I talked to last night on the phone? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Sometimes I hear things, too. Okay, lady, you know what? You're next. I'm gonna be right back. Jesus! Fucking cuckoo's nest. Bye. (THUNDERCLAP) (SOFTLY) Hey. Hey. WOMAN: (ON PA) Dr. Foley, please report to the front desk. Dr. Foley, please report to the front desk. Time to get up, Nica. It's after 7:00. Come on! (GASPS) (BREATHES RAPIDLY) Okay. Here you go. Thanks. I'll get you some water. Leave it! I... Sorry. Could I just... Could I have some privacy, please? I'd like to get dressed. (EXHALES LIGHTLY) Okay. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) (ALARM BLARING) (GASPS) Code blue! DR. FOLEY: (ON VIDEO) Mr. Barclay, I'm extremely busy. We're not running a circus here, so could you please just get to the point? (SIGHS) (GUNSHOT) (CHUCKY'S HEAD SCREAMS) That's very clever, Mr. Barclay. Very convincing. ANDY: What? No! He's alive. Just look at him. (GUNSHOT) (CHUCKY'S HEAD SCREAMS) You should get a job in the movies. ANDY: I wanna see Nica Pierce. DR. FOLEY: Could you please show Mr. Barclay out? (CHUCKY'S HEAD CHUCKLING) I'm telling you, she didn't do it! Come on. Let's go. Let's watch it again. That one just never gets old. Do me a favor, Chucky. Keep your fucking mouth shut. You know what, Andy? What if you really are crazy? Have you ever thought of that? Maybe you belong in the booby hatch with Nica. Maybe this really is just all in your head. Nica, it wasn't your fault. CLAIRE: Bullshit. DR. FOLEY: Claire, please. I took care of that woman for the past five years. I washed her hair. I wiped her ass. I listened to her crazy until 3:00 in the morning. She was my friend. If she was thinking about killing herself, I'd have known it. Not necessarily. Nica did it! She left her fucking calling card in Angela's blood! - DR. FOLEY: Angela did that. - CLAIRE: Why would she do that? Excuse me. Aren't we overlooking one other possibility? No, I don't think we are. Claire, don't you ever get tired of being wrong? No, I do not! Occam's razor. The simplest explanation is usually the right one. Chucky did it. I'm so sorry we're late. I can't believe they're digging Angela's grave already. Wait a minute, there's two of them? What an ugly doll. (IN GOOD GUY VOICE) Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play? Where the hell did he come from? NICA: From Alice. From her guardian. What did that woman say her name was? Valentine. Oh, my God. Tiffany Valentine. That was Charles Lee Ray's girlfriend. - Charles Lee Ray? - MADELEINE: Who is that? He was a serial killer in the '80s. He murdered 22 people before they shot him in a toy store. He died right next to a Good Guy doll. Charles Lee Ray's nickname was "Chucky." Please tell me that you are not gonna let her dominate the group with this crap. Nica, it's just a doll. - NICA: Then prove it. - What? Right here to everybody in this room, prove that it's just a doll. All right. (SIGHS) - Not yet. - Oh, this is ridiculous. (EXHALES) - Wait a minute, now him. - Nica. He could've switched places with it somehow. You leave my baby alone. Maddy. Wait! What are you doing? I thought we were way past this. - NICA: I was wrong. - MALCOLM: Yeah, about him. But what about the other one? Let's just go and get rid of him. Okay? Better safe than sorry, that's what I say. So why didn't he kill you when he had the chance? Because he's fucking with me. That's what he does. First, he'll kill each and every one of you in the most horrible ways you can imagine. And he'll make me watch. And then he'll kill me, too. Unless, of course, I'm a complete psychopath. Well, let's just stay positive. Madeleine! Where's Madeleine going? She took her baby out for a walk. And I think you should leave her alone. You have to go get her. No, I can't. Why not? My outdoor privileges were suspended. I hacked into Dr. Foley's computer. It was ridiculously easy, a lot easier than being CEO of a $200 billion corporation. You're Mark Zuckerberg now. Yeah. Okay. I'll take care of Ashley. Okay, fine, but, for the record, I think this is a bad idea. I'm sorry. Can you help me with this? I'm not used to this chair. - Sure. - Thanks. It's just right over here. I think there's something stuck. Yeah, it's right in here. Okay. (DOOR OPENS) - (CRUNCHING) - Ow! - Claire? - Holy shit. What are you doing? Dr. Foley, it's true. He's alive. What have you done to yourself now? What? No! It was him! Claire, why don't you come with us? - Come on. - No. No, it was him. It was him! Claire. (GRUNTS AND SHRIEKS) No! No! No! CARLOS: Stop! No! Let me go! No! Let me fucking go! (SCREAMS) No! Maddy! Madeleine! (INAUDIBLE) (GASPS) (GASPS) CLAIRE: (SCREAMS) No! No! No! No! No! Please, don't leave me here! - Got her! - No! (GRUNTS) No, please! (STRAINING) Dr. Foley! Dr. Foley! (GROANS) Just relax, Claire. (PANTING) I swear. I'm over... I won't hurt myself. I swear. No! Okay. You fuckers! You blood fucking morons! Listen to me! He'll kill us all! CARLOS: What did you give her? Ten CCs of Methohexital. Just enough to relax her. She's conscious, but she just won't be able to move. Have you ever seen her like this? No. Never. It's, uh, disturbing, but it's fascinating to see this kind of mass hysteria in action. It's quite sad, really. Hey, how's Jake? He's hanging in there, thanks. Don't you guys have an anniversary coming up? Yeah. - Finally taking him to meet my parents. - (BREATHING HEAVILY) (EXHALES) It's Malcolm. - I'm gonna need some help. - Oh, God. Just... Just relax, Claire. I'll be back in a bit. (WHIMPERS) (GASPS) (INAUDIBLE) (GASPS) (BEEPING) (BEEPING QUICKENS) (WHISPERS) No. (BREATHING HEAVILY) - (YELLS) Ah! - (GASPS) "Compressed." Does that mean what I think it means? Seriously, I'm not sure. (BEEPING RAPIDLY) (WHISPERS) No. Sometimes, I scare myself. (FLATLINING) (INAUDIBLE) What the fuck? (LAUGHING) You thought I was the only one? Wait! What are you doing? What's going on? NICA: Chucky did it. It was an accident, Nica. He killed Angela, too. I'm gonna pretend you didn't just say that. And Madeleine, he's manipulating her. She's delusional, Nica. She's projecting onto the doll, just like you are. I'm going to prove it, Dr. Foley. And you know what else? I think both dolls are alive somehow. Ade beaucoup Damballa. (GASPS) I know how crazy that sounds. No crazier than a single doll, Nica. Please tell me you understand that. What happened to the other one? Someone took it, and we'll find it. Who knows, maybe in your room. You think it was me now? To tell you the truth, Nica, at this point, I honestly don't know what to think. I'm not a killer, Dr. Foley. And I'm not fucking crazy. Nica, I want you to do something for me. I wanna hypnotize you. Hypnotizing me is not gonna make a difference. It's been very useful in the past. And it might set our minds at ease. We might find out what really happened. Nica, I don't wanna have to send you back to Lochmoor. Hypnosis helped you accept the truth. Now, are you afraid of the truth? Terrified. And you should be, too. DR. FOLEY: Keep your eyes on the light, Nica. All right, Nica, how do you feel? Receptive. As always, that's good. What if I were to tell you there are cameras at Harrogate, hidden cameras, everywhere, and your every move has been recorded? What if I were to tell you, Nica, there are recordings of you killing both Angela and Claire? What would you say to that? Well, I couldn't really argue with evidence like that. You can picture yourself killing them, can't you, Nica? Yes. Now, what if that evidence then somehow got erased? Who would wanna do that, do you think? Me would be my first guess. I agree. So we're in agreement about the murders and the tapes and your terrible guilt. Yes. (CHUCKLES LIGHTLY) What is it? Chucky. He's right behind you. (WHISPERS) I've missed these little sessions of ours. Haven't you? No. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) No, of course not. You can't remember them. Probably for the best. (GRUNTS) Holy shit! (LAUGHS) And they call me sick? This guy is... Is... Is diabolical! I mean, what a piece of work. I'm actually a little envious. You know you want to. Don't you? Yes. Come on, Nica. Time to join the club. (WHIMPERING) (GASPS) Auntie Nica. Alice? We've been waiting for you. (FOOTSTEPS THUMPING) (LAUGHS) (NICA SCREAMS) (MONITOR BEEPING) (BEEPING QUICKENS) (GASPS) (EXHALES) Dr. Foley always says late people are rude people. This is so unlike him. The late Dr. Foley. Now that has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, Nica? I sure hope nothing's happened to him now. It just kind of makes you wonder who's next. Doesn't it? What is wrong with you, Mark? That's not my name. Fine, what the hell is your name today? It's Charles. I think we've met. Madeleine? Can I hold him? I better put him down. He's getting a little cranky. Madeleine. Dr. Foley. You're okay. I have a hell of a headache. Don't you remember? I remember you hypnotized me, and then... The rest is kind of a blur. You assaulted me, Nica. He isn't real. It was you. I am very concerned by this setback, but I am willing to keep my mouth shut about this incident if you are. Oh, God. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hello, Andy. Who is this? Tiffany. Jennifer. Even I lose track. I know who you are. I'm coming for you. And for him. Actually, there's three of us at the moment, and the cult is growing all the time. Hey, Andy, you wanna join up? (GIGGLES) Fuck you. Oh, I have a message from Chucky. He said you'll know what it means. It's just a single word. He said, "Disembowel." Now, what do you suppose that means, Andy? (TIFFANY LAUGHING) (SLURPING) Madeleine? (KNOCKING) Madeleine! I never stopped loving you. (IN GOOD GUY VOICE) I'm your friend to the end. You know, Chucky, a boy's best friend is his mother. Wanna play? (GRUNTS) - DR. FOLEY: Madeleine! - (GASPS) Madeleine, what have you done? What? What have you done to your baby, Madeleine? It's not a baby, it's just a doll. Your baby. Joshua. Remember? What did you do to him, Madeleine? Say it. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. Not to me, Madeleine. Say it to him. My sweet angel, can you ever forgive me? (VOICE BREAKS) He just wouldn't stop crying. No matter what I did, I couldn't make him stop. The sound was like a sharp piece of glass drilling into my head. I was a terrible mother. I could never make him happy. You didn't kill him. - What? - Nica, please. He's just pretending. - Leave him alone! - He's alive! I like to be hugged. (LAUGHS) More than anything, I wish that he was. Wishing won't bring him back. I know that now. Come on. (SOBS) It's a doll. And it's a powerful symbol of your guilt, Malcolm's confusion, - (SCOFFS) - ...and the past. Now, don't you think it's time to bury the past once and for all? In sure and certain hope of the resurrection unto eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ, we commend unto Almighty God our loved ones, and we commit their bodies to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. May the Lord bless them and keep them and shine His light down upon them and be gracious unto them and give them peace. Amen. CARLOS: You're not buying it, are you? Nope. He'll be back. He always comes back. Visiting hours are over, sir. Gonna have to ask you to turn around. I need to see Dr. Foley, or Nica Pierce, right away. - Well, you can call and make an appointment. - No, this is an emergency. I bet, but now, please, just get back in your car and turn it around, all right? Okay, then I wanna commit myself. Get the hell out of here! Right now! (GRUNTS) (BEEPS) (GRUNTS) Night-night. This just came for you, Dr. Foley. Who's it from? Doesn't say. What happened to his hair? (EXHALES) Why would anyone send this to me? You know, we've got way more important things to worry about right now. - Let's get on our rounds. - Yeah. (WHIMPERS) (SOBBING) No shoelaces. It's all I have left of him. Dr. Foley put you on suicide watch. You know, I'd do it if I thought I could see him again. But suicides don't go to heaven, do they? I don't know, Madeleine. I just know I have two children of my own, and I'd do anything to keep them safe. Would you kill for them if it was for their own good? Do you love them that much? WOMAN: (ON PA) Nurse Ashley, please report to the nurses' station. I'll be checking on you every 15 minutes. (LAUGHING) Hi, baby. They just don't get us. And they never will. A mother's love never dies. Not even when she kills it. Now, please, one last time, come to Mommy. Will it hurt? I'll do my best. (GAGS) (SIGHS) (GRUNTS) (YELLS) Ah! (GROANS) (GROWLS) (SCREAMS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Well, you're having a bad day, aren't you, Doc? Ashley, put him to bed. (SIGHS) (VOICE BREAKS) Dr. Foley, I don't think I can do this anymore. - What? - It's too much. I'm sorry. (CHUCKLES) DR. FOLEY: Go to bed, Malcolm. Sure. Get rid of it. Yes, sir. Nica? How did you get in here? Take a fucking guess. DR. FOLEY: If this is a joke, this is not a good day for it. It was Chucky. (LAUGHS) Why do I always fall for the crazy ones? Madeleine's dead. Chucky did it. No. She killed herself. She dug him up and mutilated herself so it looked like Chucky did it. No. Unless you killed them all, Nica. You know, it doesn't really matter to me because, either way, it's gonna make a hell of a book. But now, you're gonna have to go back to Lochmoor. It's too bad, because here, I could've given you so much more personal attention. He's gonna kill you, too. (EXHALES) You're gonna die, and I'm gonna tell everybody about you. You're a diagnosed schizophrenic and a murderess of five people, that we know of. (GASPS) No one's going to listen to you. (SPITS) (SHRIEKS AND GASPS) I just can't with this guy! I don't know whether to kill him or just take notes. (LAUGHING) Now, we're gonna try this again. I'm not a killer. Not yet. Oh, my God. He's here. Took him long enough. Stupid kid. Andy's not a kid anymore. So what's your point? I'm just saying, it behooves us to watch our step. "Behooves." Listen to you. You sound like Hannibal Lecter. Can't believe they canceled that show. Where'd he come from? Who cares? Wake him up. Ade beaucoup Damballa. Give me the power, I beg of you! (SHUDDERS) What the hell happened to you? Oh. You know, I love being me. And I love my job. Especially the look on my victim's face when they realize, in that final moment, that it's all really happening. A children's toy is actually beating them to death with a yardstick! Or setting them on fire. Eviscerating them. All actual examples. A few years ago, I came across this groovy new spell Now, I can be me. - And me. - And me. And theoretically, anyone or anything with two legs and a hand for stabbing. Like Alice. It was fun for a while. People trust cute little girls almost as much as cute little dolls, but little girls can get hurt when their victims try to fight back. (SOBS) Then they ain't so cute anymore. (SOBS) (BREATHES RAPIDLY) (HISSES) Run! (SCREAMS) (GRUNTS) No. (SCREAMING) No! (SPLUTTERS) (SOBS) He made the funniest face when I drilled him! Did you see the steam when I sliced open his guts? I've never felt so alive! Yeah, well, you've been alive for, like, two minutes. (CHUCKYS LAUGHING) Welcome to the cult, pal. - Thanks. You guys are the best. - CHUCKY 2: Right. Now, I'm gonna go kill Andy. No, I wanna kill Andy. I earned it. I've been through a lot today. You got to suck titty today. Look what happened to me. Hello? Look at my hair. Oh, shit. You win. Absolutely. Sorry, pal. You go fuck him up real good. CHUCKY 2: Have fun. You, guard the door. Kill anyone that tries to get in. Right. I'll take care of her. (CAR ENGINE IDLING) (GURGLES) (TIFFANY LAUGHING) Cherry snow cone. Ah. Yummy. Just fucking do it already. Get it over with. If I wanted you dead, you'd be tits-up by now. I was never gonna kill you, Nica. Believe me, there's worse things than death. Ade beaucoup Damballa. Give me all the power, I beg of you! (GRUNTS SOFTLY) (NECK CRICKS) Ah. (GROANS) Hiya, Doc. (GROANS) Huh? (EXHALES) There's definitely perks to being supernaturally possessed. (WHIMPERS) This is for Nica. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) Ah! I did it. I killed her. I gave that bitch what she deserved. No, you didn't. I killed her. 'Cause I'm Charles! In your dreams, asshole. I'm Charles. But everybody calls me Chucky. Nobody calls me that. No, wait a... wait a minute. Who am I now? You're a fucking poser. You're sick. And not in the fun way like me. (INHALES SHARPLY) Nica? Nica's taking a nap. And I'm gonna make sure she never wakes up. (GASPS) (VOICE BREAKS) I just wanna be someone who matters. But I'm not Mark. I'm not Michael. I'm... I'm just Malcolm. Fucking Multiple Malcolm. Sounds like it's getting pretty crowded in there. I can hear him. I can still hear Chucky inside my head! (WHIRRING) (SCREAMING) (LAUGHING) And it was such a nice place to visit. (LAUGHING) Ah. (BEEPS) Andy Barclay, as I live and breathe. Ah!
