(cheerful music) ♫ Come into my life and climb into my bed ♫ There'll be holding hands, there'll be faces red ♫ I really only offered 'cause my place was close ♫ I see you're drunk and me, almost ♫ Won't say much 'cause the truth will hurt ♫ But you can keep your mix tape and the t-shirt ♫ Really gotta rest, gotta get some sleep ♫ But you keep leaning in, you keep whispering ♫ But I ♫ I ain't even here ♫ I'm just bored I don't know what to do with my love ♫ Oh but I ♫ I ain't even calling ♫ I'm just bored, I don't know what to do with my time (soft music) - Stevie. - [Rodney] Grab the rail, grab the rail, grab the rail. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Hang on. (groaning) (tense music) (groaning) - Babe. (dramatic music) (grunting) Steve, stop, what the fuck are you doing, fuck. (solemn music) (knocking on door) - [Steve] Peg. - Sit down. Mind if I call you Steve? - Whatever. - All right, this is your corner of my desk. We have to share. Budget cuts, thanks to the department. I've got your bloody forms coming up my arse. This one from the parole board wants me to assess your long term goals and aspirations. Bloody waste of paper. I don't even know what I'm having for morning tea. You'll always have some clients won't eat the stuff and then one day you notice they've got a very fat cat or dog. Anyway, you collect the meals from here. Ready made, ready labeled. Are you listening? She's one of your regulars. Signora Francesca Amore. Franky, it'll get you laughing, come on. Let's go and meet my boss the filing cabinet. (laughing) (laughing) (clapping) - Magic, magic. Magic, magic, magic. (laughing) (gasping) (laughing) (clapping) Thank you. - Mobile Canteen. - [Rodney] Mobile Canteen! - Do you want it or not? (shouting) - To the kitchen! (shouting) (snapping) Just plug 'em on the table. Nice design. Not often we get visitors. Cup of tea? It's all part of the job description, isn't it? Cup of tea, chat with the clients. - No thanks. All right, we'll see you next time. - No, no, no, stay, please. How's Peg, Peggy Sue, oh Peggy. Do you like Betty Hoggy? - I don't know him. - Neither do I. Do you like magic? - I don't know. (speaks foreign language) - A very simple illusion (speaks foreign language). The tack which is, is not. (speaks foreign language) Is! - [Franky] Roberto. (laughing) Roberto. (muttering) Roberto. (muffled speaking) (objects clanking) My name is Roberto Giovanni Lorenzo Maldini. But you can call me Rodney. (object clanking) My mama. - Maybe she's hungry. - Maybe. - All right, well, I'll leave you to it. - Thank you, I'll see you next time. (rock music) (chattering) - Hey Stevie, Susan said nothing about you getting out. - Yeah, so I heard. - What was it like, mate? - What do you expect him to say, you, Bindi. - Bindi? - Yeah, he's a wee with a tiny prick. - Real funny, you guys wouldn't know. - Hey Sus, Bindi. Hey Stevie, I heard a lot about you, mate. - Tommy's one of the supervisors where I used to work. - Used to? - Yeah, I lost my job. - All right. - But Tommy's gonna get it back, aren't you, Tommy? - What do you got in mind, Stevie? - I don't know, I haven't got any plans, I was just gonna see what happens. - [Tommy] That's good, what do you reckon, Sus? - I reckon you see what happens like Stevie said. - No rush, especially if you've spent, what'd you say, Sus, three and a half years? Fuck that was bad luck. Still better luck than what's his name? Pauly, right? - Got your towel, babe. - [Steve] You and Tommy, he been fucking you? - Shit, Stevie. Three and a half years is a long time. I'm not seeing him anymore. Not now you're home. - Ah, yes. Thank you, thank you, thank you. - [Franky] Roberto. (speaks foreign language) (easygoing music) (speaks foreign language) - Come on. (easygoing music) (record needle scratching) - You all right? Rodney. - We're just resting, would you like the next dance? (Franky mumbling) Can you? (laughs) Can you help me get her back into the wheelchair? (groaning) (laughing) She always was a bit frisky. Come on, mama. (groaning) Get Mama over here, over here. Mama, this is Steven. The new Mobile Canteen man and this is mama. Signora Francesca Amore. Well Franky if you want. - Good day. - You can shake her hand, it won't come off. (laughing) - Her movement comes and goes. I was gonna give her a bath. But all this activity, it's worn me out. Maybe you'd like to bathe Mama. - Um, I don't reckon. - She's really no trouble, she just lies there enjoying herself, all the attention. Drying her can be a little tricky if you're a little bit skirmish. (laughing) Don't take it so personally. - I actually have to go. - (laughs) Yeah, you don't wanna be late for your next delivery. Peggy Sue can get a bit cranky. - Sorry, okay. You told me you stopped seeing him! - You weren't the one left behind. You weren't the one who had to full his fucking (mumbles). - They wouldn't let me go! I told you that! (shouting) - Fucking say it! Say it! It's my fault, isn't it? - [Susie] Stevie, I lost the both of you that night. (classical music) - Rodney, Franky. I've got your meals. - In here. - Oh shit. I am so sorry, Rodney. I had no idea you were bathing Franky. - No, no, no, it's all right, come in, come in, sit down. - [Steve] She hasn't got any clothes on, mate. - That's because she's having a bath, Steven. Oh no! - What's up? - Nothing, come on, come in, sit down. She may be old and wrinkly but she's never been ashamed of her body. Come on. She's off of her guns. Painkillers, some days are better than others. You'd never know it was the same person. - You, um, meals are on the kitchen table. - They want me to put her in a nursing home. A prison for unwanted mamas and papas. Imagine. She'd rather be dead. Care to join me in a milkshake? Oh come on, I won't tell Peggy. - I don't know. - [Rodney] Chocolate, banana, strawberry, caramels, vanilla, anise seed, (mumbles), I cater for all tastes here. - Molten banana with chocolate. - (laughs) Easy as one, two, three. (laughing) - Rod, what about your mum? Aye. How'd you do that? (laughing) - Madame. Monsieur, may I just mention it seems all your attention has brought Madame Amore back for an encore. (laughing) Please, please sit down, (mumbles) enjoy milkshake. (Franky laughing) - Saucy! - Stop! (screams) - [Peggy] She should be in a nursing home. - The other morning she was waltzing around the house with Steven. - And the community nurse tells me you've asked for another prescription of morphine. - How else am I supposed to get through the day? You spend too much time immersed in the affairs of the decrepit and the dying, Peg. - You do pretty well out of us Rodney. - Yeah, you're right, when we kick the bucket it won't be because we starved to death. - Oh, so I'll tell Steve's parole manager that he's kept both of you very well fed then, will I? - Oh speaking of food, Steven. Franky and I would like you to join us for dinner tonight. - Sure. - [Susie] We're going out. - I'm already going out. - [Susie] Well, where? - To dinner. - Well who with? - [Steve] Someone I deliver meals to. - I just thought maybe you'd might wanna come with us. - I said I'd go, I wanna go. - Okay, we'll be at Bindi's. - Yeah whatever. - Bye. - Have fun. - Yeah, mate. (jazzy music) - No. No. Maybe. (laughing) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (humming) Oh! (laughing) Spaghetti bolognese. Peggy Sue and the Franky team at Mobile Canteen. Franky won't be joining us tonight, she's... Having an early night. But, you never know. Ole! - How long have you been looking after your mum? - Too long if you ask Peggy Sue and the department. Besides the post polio syndrome, and the hardening in the arteries in the brain and the dementia, arthritis, the morphine and the strokes or brain attacks I think they call them now, she's in excellent condition. - What about your dad? - Questions, questions, so many questions. The story of my dad. Vincenzo Maldini, we can call him Enzo. Theatrical producer and circus entrepreneur. Art time, financier, wheeler and dealer. Mid time, Casanova, full time, very Italian, cousins in Muswellbrook. My mother Signora Francesca Amore was a very famous Italian cabaret artist. And he was her personal manager and lover. We were on an international tour. Sometime in the '60s, '70s I think it was. Europe, South America, Asia, Sydney, the Harbour Bridge, Opera House, packed houses, glowing reviews, success after success after success. Then Mama is struck by illness, bitten by a mosquito they say. Probably from Muswellbrook. The tour ends, Vincenzo travels back to Milan to set up the deal to end all deals. A national homecoming tour for Madame Francesca Amore. (chuckling) That was a long time ago. And Franky's convinced he's coming back for her. - Why didn't she just get back on her own? - My mama's a very, very proud and stubborn woman. Besides she got sicker and I had to look after her. It all became very tiring. (beeping) The end, saved by the bell. - Mum is dead. Dad and I, we never got on, you know? - I never really knew my father either. In fact the only thing I have to show for, Vincenzo Maldini... Is... This. He gave it to Franky and she never let it out of her sight. She says I can have it when he comes back for her. - When will that be? (laughing) - Who knows? But the show must go on. It's very valuable. - It's Italian. (speaks foreign language) - Very nice. (rock music) (grunting) - Fuck off! Sus. - Hey. - Babe? - She's doing me a favor, mate. (grunting) Get him off me! You gutless fuck! You think I don't know how you stayed alive inside? (groaning) What kind of man does that make you, eh? The kind of man that leaves his mate to die like a dog on the side of the road? You filthy fuck. (screaming) (melancholy music) (crying) (knocking on door) - I need somewhere to stay. (groaning) - Bonjour. I didn't realize delivering meals could be so dangerous. (speaks foreign language) hot. Ah. - Thanks. - This used to be my room. I always had sweet dreams in this bed. (speaks foreign language) - Do you mind if I stay? - As long as you want. (speaks foreign language) Special guest. - Thanks. How'd you learn all those languages? - Well, when Signora Francesca Amore sang and danced her way across Europe, I tip tapped toe behind. (laughing) - Not bad. (speaks foreign language) - But she was always the star even when I was on stage with her. She even danced with his royal highness, the Prince of Wales (speaks foreign language). (laughing) - [Steve] Don't you get tired of doing all this stuff? You know all these funny voices? - [Rodney] No, it's like flying a kite. Up and away. High in the sky like an eagle. - You're fucking mad. You're a kid. - [Rodney] Make believe the stuff of dreams. - [Steve] I never did have very good dreams. - Don't take it so personally, Steven. Some people say that life is just one bad dream wedged between waking up and waking up. (laughs) I don't believe that bullshit. Nobody tells me what to dream. - I'm sorry. - No, I'm sorry. You need help, Sus. - You could help me. - I can't even help myself. There's somebody that I need to find. I'm sure that Tommy knows him. Do you think you can ask Tommy without him getting suspicious? - What's his name? - We all knew him as Raven. - Why do you need to see him? - Can you help me find him? - Yeah. - Community health and palliative care. Watch your back, Steven, the vultures are circling. Apparently they don't approve of Franky mowing the lawns. Hey, you're just in time for our afternoon walk. Could you grab that barrel of manure and bring it down for us? - Yep. - Ta. (whistling) You're a good man. One man's shit is another man's fertilizer, Steven. (speaks foreign language) (laughing) - Is it all right with Franky me staying? - Ask her yourself. Go on. Mama. I think that means you can stay. (opera music) (laughing) (Franky shouting) (muttering) (shouting) - [Steve] Rod! - There's pink liquid in the top drawer. Put 30 mils into a syringe. Steven, the pink syrup in the top drawer. It's all right, Mama, I'm here. (mumbles) Please! The morphine, 30 mils, it's all right, it's all right. (muttering) - It only says 10. - She'll take 30. Mama. Franky. Yes. Yes. Yes. (speaks foreign language) Shh. Franky, Mama. Enzo's coming. Enzo's coming home. (Franky muttering) Just like old times, full of surprises. (upbeat country music) (cheering) Up the hill we go. Bravo Franc, whoa. (laughing) What are you dreaming about? - Peg. She'll spew. - You're right, we should've asked her to come along. (laughing) ♫ Mirror ball was turning ♫ The stars were spinning round ♫ You and I were dancing ♫ I could hardly feel the ground ♫ We thought we'd laugh forever ♫ And dream our lives away ♫ Above the pain, above the clouds ♫ Til we were old and gray ♫ And we danced ♫ For love and joy ♫ We danced ♫ Our whole lives through ♫ We danced ♫ And dreamed forever ♫ Until our dreams came true (clapping) Franky's theme song. All over the world they'd play it for her as she walked out on stage. I watched from the wings and sing every word with her. And one night, she called me to come out on stage with her. I'll never forget the look on her face. So radiant, so happy. Her eyes just shone. And I walked out and it was like floating on a cloud on a clear summer's day. And then the audience cheered and stomped and clapped. It was exhilarating. The noise was deafening. She put her arms around me and whispered your daddy and I are so proud of you, my dearest. I would've done anything on earth for her that night. And then she picked me up and we danced the rest of the song together. I didn't want it to end. - What if you'd smashed the (mumbles) up? What if somebody got hurt and the police had to report it. I suppose you let Franky have a drive. Look, don't you let him carry you away with all his crap. You're still on parole, don't forget it. - There's nothing to carry me away anyway. He's not like anyone I've ever met. - I'll bet. - I like him, I'm gonna be staying at his place for a while. - You told me you were staying with mates. - He is one of my mates. Peg, can you do me a favor? One of my mates, Susie. She's in a bit of trouble. I was wondering if you could talk to her. You know about where she can get some help. - Sure, I can do that. And what about doing me a favor? What about talking to your other mate about getting his mum into an aged care facility? - Sure. (thunder rumbling) You look stuffed. - [Rodney] Franky's, Franky's being Franky. Mind if I sit down? - It's your bed. - So much for sweet dreams. Read to me? - A shadow fell across his face. He rolled his eyes to see what had come between him and the pale bitter sun. A vulture with hooked talons and greedy beak hung in the air. You should see this picture. Stony eyes meant his, then it swooped and the titan writhed and screamed until the mountains cracked. Again and again the hungry bird flew at him and tore at his undefended liver. His agony had begun. (thunder rumbling) (chattering) - What about a story from behind the prison bars? - Once there was a young boy who found himself inside a vulture's lair because he had been very, very bad. - Yes. - At first life for the boy was simply frightening. And frightening. (shouting) And frightening! (laughs) (speaks foreign language) And then one day, along came a bigger, meaner, nastier vulture than all the others. The young boy forgot about his agony and wandered around with the nasty vulture. Might actually love him. The nasty vulture got such a shock to hear the young boy speak those words that he got up and he flew away. Leaving the young boy all alone. The young boy, he didn't know what to do. (phone ringing) Bind, what? Fuck. All right, um. Brick, calm down, mate. - [Bindi] She's out of it, mate, Tom did her over, he's pissed off. - Sus. Sus, it's me. - Stevie? (upbeat music) - Now you. (laughing) (toy squeaking) - Here, take it. - Alright, got it, got it. (toy squeaking) (shouting) Shit. You did that on purpose. (speaks foreign language) I'm gonna take you back inside if you're gonna be like that. (toy squeaking) It's all tangled. - Hold that. - Maybe we should just cut it. - No. It's almost four years to the day since I killed my best friend, Pauly. I ran him down in my car. I ran over him twice. See, that's meant to go through there. - Right. - Hold that. Me, Susie and Pauly we're best mates. We believed in each other. Me and Pauly were delivering some dope. We thought we knew what we were doing but we fucked up big time. We were being chased by these big guys with baseball bats. It was pissing down with rain, I couldn't see anything, I jumped in the car, I thought Pauly was beside me, he wasn't, I go to take off in reverse right over him, fuck him, bang. I could hear the tires go up over him. Heard him screaming me name. I panicked, I go print forward, you know, I didn't know what I was doing. I got out of the car, I could hear him moaning. I could've got to him but I choked. All I could think about is what those guys would do if they caught me. So I ran. I left Pauly on the side of the road like a fucking dog. When I came back later he was still there. I just laid on him, put my face on his. I ran right over the top of his head. His skull was completely smashed in. He had one eye open like he was winking going oh good driving, mate, yeah, nice driving mate. And I just sat there all night, and it rained, and I was hoping he was gonna get up. Said let's go have a drink. Let's go home. There you go. (toilet flushes) Sorry Rod, I didn't know you were in there. Just having a quick shave, yeah? - It's all right. You're nearly part of the family now. May I? - You look like you could do with a quick shave, mate. - Nah, I haven't got the energy. - Sit down. Sit down. I always wanted to be a barber. There. Look better already. - I used to be able to dress up with one hand, prepare a meal with the other, powder my nose and juggle four balls. Now I get you to deliver the food, help Franky to bed, give me a shave. (breathing heavily) (muttering) - Now I know what it feels like when you're killing time. - She's my mother. - It's you I'm talking about. - [Rodney] Me? - You want more. I can see it. - What about you? What do you want? - I want you to get a life. I don't know. Why don't you get back on stage? A real stage. Not this pretend show you and Franky put on. - But what a show, eh? (film reeling) (upbeat music) (laughing) You're making me nervous. - You shouldn't be. The stage, it's hundreds of people. - I know, I shouldn't be. (mumbles) Me too. What exactly? - You get real situations, grab them, mangle them about until you turn them into something that suits you. (chuckling) - [Rodney] It's simple magic, it's simple deceit. (chuckles) - See what I mean? - No. - I don't mean to be. - [Rodney] What? - Make you mad at us. - Maybe we should go into the kitchen or something, With Franky trying to sleep. - I think Franky's way asleep. (chuckles) - Franky never sleeps. I'm not used to this kind of thing. - So? - Tea? - Black. - It's not something I expected. (moaning) - [Steve] Look at me. (object clunking) (Franky muttering) - No, Mama. - Maybe he's not coming back, Mama. - Strangers, strangers, stranger, strangers, strangers, there was strangers. Shadows to my heart. (humming) (doorbell ringing) (easygoing music) (speaks foreign language) - [Rodney] Coming, coming. - Oh. Um, I'm looking for Stevie. - Come in, Susie. - How do you know it's me? - I don't, are you? - What? - Are you you? - What? Um, yeah, I'm me. - I know but the illusion can be very deceiving. Come in, meet the family. Steven, Susanna (speaks foreign language). Sleepyhead. (speaks foreign language) Francesca Amore. How's your French? Mama, (speaks foreign language) Susie. Italian? Good, good, the two of you should get on well together. You know I'm me. - What? - Rodney. Ah, Steven. Can I get you a drink of water? I was just about to have a shower. She's a lovely girl. - He's off his tree. - Not really, he's just full of energy. How are you going? - I'm all right. How are you? - Yeah, I'm good. - I spoke to your boss Peg. Yeah, she got me some help. - That's good. - Yeah, she's a nice lady. - Yeah. - She said that you asked her to help me. - Yeah. So where are you staying? - I'm staying at Bindi's. You're not jealous, are ya? - I'm sorry about. (Susie mumbles) - I found your bird man. Raven? Yeah, I know where he is. - Where is he? - He runs a pub somewhere in Sydney. Yeah, it's the address. (groaning) - You can open your eyes now. (breathing heavily) - I have to go out. - Steven. - Leave it. I won't be long. - Are you and Stevie? - You're not jealous, are you? What's wrong, what's wrong? - I can't talk about it. - Why not? Steve, what is it? - There's someone in Sydney. - Who? - Someone I knew on the inside. - What about him? - Look I can't talk about it. - Maybe I can help. - I doubt it. - What's his name? - Raven. - Sounds nasty, you wanna watch him? Do you wanna see him? - Maybe. - [Rodney] Maybe she shouldn't. ♫ These shoes were made for walking ♫ And that's what they gotta do - [Steve] What are you doing? ♫ I'll tramp them all around the world ♫ And then I'll trample all over you - [Steve] Rod, shut up. (singing) ♫ I love to sing when I hike, I love to hike - [Steve] Shut up. ♫ Someday I might get a bike - [Steve] I'll fucking hit you! - [Rodney] Wow! (shouting) - You're nuts. (Rodney mumbles) Stop it. ♫ I'll tramp-- - Shut up. (singing) Please stop it. (singing) I said. ♫ Someday I might get a bike (laughing) - You win. You're a funny bugger. I don't know what I am. You tell me, funny man. Who am I? What kind of man am I? - You can be whatever, Steven. With our imagination, we make the world. - Don't suppose Rodney's made a decision about Franky yet. - [Steve] I wouldn't hold your breath. I told him to get back on stage. - In his dreams. Like he's ever been on a real stage. - What do you mean? He's been on stage with his mum. He's been all over Europe and stuff. - Europe? He's never even been to Europe. And on a stage with Franky? Like I said maybe in his dreams. - Of course he has, I've seen all the trophies and pictures. - Look, I don't know what pictures and trophies you've seen but-- - And he speaks all those languages. - If she ever did any dancing, it was when she was a kid before she came to Australia. She might've done a bit in the clubs here, down the central coast years ago. But-- - Bullshit. - Steven, when she came to Australia, she got polio. That's a physical disability. Then she had strokes, all kinds of stuff, I've seen her medical records. - But he told me all those stories about her. - He makes them up, for himself, for his mum and anybody gallivant enough to believe them. He's a classic backyard magician. I thought I made that clear to you. - But... He went on an international tour. He said so. - Rodney was 12 when Franky got polio. He's basically been looking after her ever since. I don't think he even finished high school. - Why wouldn't he tell me that? - It's not the kind of show they do, is it? I mean who'd pay money to see that? - I'll see you. - On the count of three. Keep your eyes on the handle. - No more games, Rodney. - There's no room for that, Steven. Three. You see, it's all about the thrower. You just have to lend him your hands. Okay, two more to go. - Why'd you tell me all those bullshit stories? - You know, you shouldn't let Peggy Sue carry you away with all that fancy talk? - What? - One man's bullshit is another man's fertilizer, Steven. (shouting) - Bullshit. - Thanks I really needed that. - [Steve] Don't be fucking smart. - 40 years I've been looking after Franky. - Yeah I've heard this story. - That's a long time to try to remember what happened in your life. What you wanted to happen, what you were told happened, what really happened. She really did have the world in her hands, but she fell in love with a cheap con man. - Get out of my face. - She was pregnant, he brought her to Australia and he left her all alone. No family, no money and her baby boy, me. - Tell someone who gives a shit, Rodney. - She had her dreams, Steven! We all have dreams! - You made lies, you fuck! (shouting) - Can you love unless you do that, can you? What did she tell herself? What did she tell her son everyday? Bullshit! Lies! (shouting) 40 years I've dressed her, fed her, medicated her, entertained her, bathed her, and you're right, Steve. I am tired of bathing Franky. (crying) Just soar like an eagle, it's just a dream. - The other night, was that a dream? - No, that was us, you're in there. - How could I believe ya? - Suspend your disbelief. That's what makes a good story. You'd make a great audience. - Well how stupid does that make me. I was too busy being a great audience to see what was going on. I'm gonna find Raven. And this time I'm not gonna let him get away. Peg said there's a bed for Franky in the nursing home now. I know what I'd be doing. I'm going to Sydney. (Rodney and Franky chattering) - I'm your son. (crying) (pensive electronic music) - Enzo, gone. Not coming back. - No Mama. He's gone. Papa's gone forever. - [Franky] Forever. - Forever.

(grunting) Ask me the same question that I asked you. - Do you love me? - What, I didn't hear you? - I said, do you love me? - That's it, you never answered me. Why not? - I did what I had to (mumbles) survive. Nothing else, I looked after you, don't you forget that. You looked after me, that's it. - That's not it. Things aren't always what they seemed. If you want to know what's fucking going on, you open your eyes and look, so you open your fucking eyes now. Do I love you? You're asking me now? (crying out) You can open your eyes now. (train chugging) - What did you see in the big city? - People trying to get on with their lives. Like me. You. Raven. I just wanted to know if what he'd done, what we'd done was important. But all I saw was fear. The same fear I saw back then. And for a moment, we saw each other. Without any of the show. I left him to it and caught the train back. - I knew you would. - I knew you knew. - Steven. Mama's dead. - God. - No, no, no. It was gentle and peaceful as it should be.
