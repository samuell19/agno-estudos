(Music: “Hot Love“ by T. Rex) I told him the sad truth, that I've never even been to any. That we have 42 million acres of it and you can't throw a stone in Asia without hitting a cultivation, and I haven't even touched one fucking palm fruit. No seriously, I'm not joking. Ian, you want to know what he answered? “Who needs to know how to build a car to sell it?" Yes! I told you, everything is perfectly fine. 50 million. Ja. No, I can't do a conference call because I'm already in the Black Forest. Where the famous Black Forest ham comes from? You're investing in agriculture and you don't know Black Forest ham, you uncultivated Irish prick? You get what you give, man. You get what you give. Forget it, I won't do it today. I didn't have one day off for a whole fucking year and this is important. Drive around quickly. Would it be possible that we could drive around the barrier? I'm in a hurry. This is not allowed. I got it. It's just ... you know, my father died and ... the funeral begins in ten minutes. I go to those who love me and I wait for those who love me. What about Christian now? How long does the train take? It's always different. Koa scho take a quarter of an hour. - A quarter hour?! We can't stand around here for a quarter of an hour. I can not believe it. Give yourself a jerk and just drive past here. I'm losing my license. - How come? We're all alone. I've lived abroad for the past 15 years. That only happens here. Would you stop in front of such a mini-barrier in your country? Certainly not. Where are you from? - From Villingen-Schwenningen. No where you were born. - Well, in Villingen-Schwenningen. You were fifty years ago, dear Erich, as a stranger the love to your Johanna followed. And has asked you: What wave the people with Striebele, Nonnenfürzle and Brägele. 20 minutes. - I know. Do you hear that? Yes, I think I hear something. Can you do that? Noi, I only thought because you're in such a hurry. Now I hear something too. This is a rattle. - Yes! That's the train. Hurry up now. - As fast as 1 can. But nothing where the license is gone afterwards. - But I went to the limit. Amen. Georg, please. I am not a great speaker. You all knew my father. And when I look around like that, then ... sometimes longer than I knew him. Because he lived here before I was born. You're too late. Yes I know. I'm sorry. You can't even be on time for the funeral . There was a train barrier. 30 years and you can't even do him that last little honor. 'Sorry. P-Papa ... 'Sorry, it doesn't work that way. Georg! Georg! Georg! Georg, stop now! It's the fucking funeral of my father and you call me every fucking hour. I know I'm your slave, but please not today. I don't care, I'm not his nanny! And tell him to fuck off with his stupid money. Nothing has changed. Oah, the smell ... This is real childhood. Georg, now ... Do you really want to go through with this all evening? Do you want your "Georg" mug too? "Do you want a beer too, Christian?" Oh, very much, Georg. How attentive. "And a little schnapps with it?" Yes why not. Nick-nick-nick. Look here. Yeah it was shit. I could list all the reasons I was late But I'll leave it now and just say I'm really sorry Because we don't want to be silent all evening either, do we? Was that a yes or a no or a "lick my ass"? A "lick my ass". Well. Very good. I can handle that. Madness. How low the ceilings really are. You lived here with dad the whole time? Nah, just the last time he really gave a shit. Stress? Yes, it's always stress. Every day. But that's okay. One guy wants to invest money and my boss is scared of losing him. Where do you live right now? - Singapore. About a year. And what's it like in Singapore? I don't know, haven't looked at it yet. When I arrived my company had already rented an apartment but since I was only there to sleep I only noticed after three months that it had a balcony. When are you going again - Very early in the morning. First machine. And with you? As always. What does the carpentry do? - Running. Married? - Nope. Children? - Nope. Humid? Girlfriend? Oh, Georg! Yes, there is not so much talk in the country , but ... No girlfriend at the moment. Neither do I. Incredible, huh? I remember it so immensely. Now it's so small. Does the attic still exist? Really? - Well, sure. How cool! You will probably still be there when I come back, right? Madness. I can not believe it. I can not believe it! Nobody was here for ages. George! Get up! Is that awesome! That's impossible! Georg, come on! The chimney was so drunk it left everything behind. There is still food left. Anyway, you just got something else to do like cooking. Thank you. I'll put it in the fridge, right? It was a nice memorial service. Except for the wrestling match. Yes, that was a bit surprising. But ... are you okay again? - Yes, yes, everything is okay. No, that's great! Come on, you coward! I'll shave your legs. - It has not changed. No. - Come on at last! Get your offended ass moving and face yourself! Hello Christian. Hello. I'm going again. You must have a lot to talk about. No, we have nothing to talk about. Good night. And thanks again. For today. - Yes. Ade, Christian. - Ade. Come on now. I'll nail you to the wall. And bring the sausages. I'm hungry. Who was that again? - Tanya. Went to class with you. Here. That's right. Is still a real board, the Tännle, I have to say. Here. Come on, just a couple of rallies. What did you do on your finger? Nothing. - nothing? Yes, it works. Yes! Nice! So you and the crowd, yes? - What? No! But it looked like it. - She helped me with the funeral. And at the funeral feast. - Don't have to justify yourself. Hit. - wonder point? Now do. Good ball. (Music: "Close To Me" by The Cure) N / A? That's how it is. Yes! Yes! "In number 10, a brand new group ..." Georg? Look, come here. Come paint here. Do you still know? The card is still hanging there. "Rule No. 1: The journey begins at the fountain in the market square of Löchingen and ends when the participants at Timmendorfer Strand pee in the Baltic Sea. "Rule No. 2: The trip must be made on the moped. "Rule No. 3: Participants undertake to drink during the trip, Take drugs, have sex, make an ass bomb of the ten To have sex ... "To eat the entire menu at the Greek restaurant at once." Was that your idea - Nah, that was yours. "Doing a 20 meter wheelie down a slope. "Knocking over a sleeping cow." - And the? That was mine. I still think that's pretty good. Do the mopeds still exist? Throwing away wasn't his forte, was it? Hot. Fuck! And! Is that awesome! Come on! Come on, we'll drive past the Tännle. Come on now! (Music: "I Have Been To The Mountain" by Kevin Morby) Hot. The fountain! Yes and? The journey begins at the fountain in the market square of Löchingen. Come on, let's go now. On the spot. We're totally blue. Yeah, I know, but that's awesome. Nah, that's bullshit. I know. Hold on, hold on! Please stop. Stop it! Don't laugh now. We just drive now. And your flight tomorrow morning? - I'll tell them something. Tell me you don't regret Tell me that you don't regret that we didn't drive back then. Of course I regret it. Still bullshit . I have to fix a barn this week . Let's just drive. Georg! I didn't lock the garage. - The garage! Mann, Georg! Be a little adventurous. (Music: “Boys Don't Cw“ by The Cure) What's the name of the next town again? - Villingen-Schwenningen. Villingen-Schwenningen, baby! No stop to Villingen-Schwenningen! Yeah! Georg! Georg! Everything okay? - Yes. I just closed my eyes for a moment. Let's take a break. - Yes. Or a coffee. I'll write it to the expense account. My butt hurts like I've ridden the track. I can no longer walk properly, so my bottom hurts. As if you had been fucked really nice . Do you have a decent wellness area here? - Yes. With a view over the Black Forest. - Excellent. Look here. You just ca n't do it anymore, dear. And? It starts with ... Beep. “Jesus, call me immediately when you've arrived, will ya?" Beep. “Christian, switch your bloody cellphone back on." Beep. “What the fuck do you think you are? What is goin' on, Christian? “Put your fuckin' cellphone back on!" Beep. “Who do you think you are, you cunt? Can you imagine what's going on here at the office? Feisigh Ieat, bod!“ That was call 12 from ... about 30. Have you called back yet? No, not yet. I think I have to go back. You can not be serious. - It's really stressful now. I thought you were always stressed. - Yes, but this time stress squared. And our trip? We do it, I promise you. I take a vacation and then ... let's catch it up. Nonsense. If we don't do it now , we'll never do it. You know what? Do what you want. I keep going. Georg. I need my key - Are you leaving us again? - Yes. Were you satisfied then? - Yes very good. - Georg! Now wait a minute. You say to me, "Be a little adventurous." And you? It was clear that they were calling you. - Yes I know. Just talk and then just run away. That is not true. - 'of course that's true! Stop eating my salami! This is Black Forest ham. - Crap! Oh, dude! Georg! Now wait a minute! Couldn't we at least have finished eating ? Breakfast was really expensive. Do not yell at me like that. Ah, fuck. Now both of you go out briefly. Hurry up! Everything is full of crumbs again. Hello. Alright guys? Where are we going? - In the Taunus. Vacation? We also. We made ourselves extra chic. In case we have an interview. Where are you going? We take every 2nd exit on the left and let us surprise us. Really. Tach. - Come on now. And watch out now, will you? - Yes / Yes. Yeah, be careful with the crumbs, right? Good Trip! Have fun in the Taunus! I completely forgot that you don't say hello in Germany. Every 2nd left? - Why not? Have you been tinkering with the plan for a long time? - Let's see where we're going. Maybe that will lead us to something great. - Yes, in a circle. Oh, Georg, you are such a pessimist. Such a rain cloud. You invented the parachute in front of the airplane. Let the glass be half full. We do it: Today I decide how we drive, then you. Always changing. I say we take every 2nd exit on the left. Can I suggest a compromise? - I ask. Is the glass still half full if we first take every 2nd right and then every 2nd left? Sarcasm is really not your thing, Georg. (Music: "I'll Be Around" by Yo La Tengo) Links. Left here, right? Was, links? Okay. Right. Ey, never right here! This is the second time. Oh, it's getting swampy here. Right. - No, left. Then the next on the right. - The next one on the right again. Thank you very much. What would you like to have? - It was the lady's turn in front of me. Two white ones, please. I think that's nice. I thought the kind of man was long gone. I'll take two too. What did you do on the hand? - work accident. Nothing wild. Five beers for the men from the sawmill? I've never heard that before. Really funny. Dumbass. - Dumbass. How's your bum - I'm getting used to it. And you? A cornea is slowly forming on me. What are you doing with your boss now? I'll leave it out and come up with an excuse. Maybe I had an accident and only through music therapy did I remember who I am. Or maybe not. What's there? - Don't turn around! Is she watching you? - I do not think so. But! She's watching you. She wants you to sit down with her. - How so? It flashes in neon letters on her forehead: "Make love with me, strange man from the Black Forest. " We're going over. - no! Why not? Don't think so? Yes, but I can't. - Why not? Because I can't do that. I'm not good at this. Let your natural charm play out. - I have not. You have a barrel full of natural charm. I can't just speak to a complete stranger. She's married anyway. Stop thinking that something is not yours. It goes on all the time. Be selfish. The adventure George. Go over and talk to her. Come over! Los! - Christian! Come on now! Is that the table of the wine queens? - More like her mothers table. Even that is a daring claim. The last copy. Hello. Ute, by the way. - Georg. Did I miss something? - It's a gentleman. Do you want to sit down? And. I am Christian. - Ingrid. Hello. - Out. Hi, Ute. - Nice suits. Where are you from? From the Black Forest. I can check in at the airport at the last minute. I'm good, um ... - Don't think! Do not rush me. I'm good ... with wood. With wood? - Yes, my job is. Further! It has to be done quickly. I'm good at buying things that I neither need nor want. I can do much better! - Ute, hop, hop! Last weekend ... - Go on! Yes Yes Yes. OK... I am good at parking. - Oh, okay. I can massage well. We want to see the evidence. - later. Georg, what can you do? - I, uh ... I'm good at ... playing table tennis. - We were notorious. The Schneider brothers, legends in the Black Forest. - legends? I can argue well. - Good ability. Important. I'm good at saying things backwards. Wine festival. - Tsefniev. Yes. - Timmendorfer Strand. Dnarts refrodnemmit. You're awesome, Ute. - Etu, reilank red aj tsib ud. That is impossible! Photographic memory. - Okay ... Storage rack. - Yes, you me too. Hö-hey. Did Tim wore such light-colored pants ... ... never with a belt. Yes, it is notorious. When grilling grilling, grilling grilling grilling. Yes! - Hot! I am good at tap dancing. - Right. We were tap dance legends. In the black Forest. - Yes. Was? That's a lot of legends all at once, table tennis and tap dancing. Why don't we know you guys? - Because you live in a dump, Where everyone dresses like in "Heidi". What? - But well, you doubt? Then we have no other choice. What are you doing there? - Oh God. Sorry for the interruption, we just found out ... that today two tap dance legends from the Black Forest are present. Georg, are you coming? Ladies and gentlemen... Georg "Happy Feet" Schneider! One... two... Isolated laughter. Okay. One, two, three, four... Wow. Bravo! Table free! Can it also make bubbles? Sure, it can have different colors. - Not him. Wow! I'm sitting right on it. - It's awesome! You're welcome! We have to be really quiet about the neighbors. That's right, the neighbors. The lovely neighbours. - Shh! The dear neighbors must not be disturbed! - hey! Just leave him. Come on, that's really good. That's really liberating, Ingrid. Let it out, Ingrid. The. What was that? Let go. - Aaa! Very good. Very good. Let it out. Come on, get it right ... Yes very good! Fuck the dear neighbors! Fuck the neighbors! - Fuck always be quiet! Fuck always be quiet! - Go on! Fuck your night's rest until 10 p.m.! Fuck your clipped hedges and your stupid ... Shitty sweeping week! Fuck my bastard and his fucking assistant with the made tits! And I give a shit about you too, you fucking moon! Yes, fuck you, you fucking moon! Have not delivered anything new for years! Can just shine in front of you. That's not an attitude! Wow! That was an announcement. Now everyone! Come up! Come on everyone up. And. Wait, wait, wait Worth. We can have sex, but fucking is not an option. Do you understand, right? Do you want to start or me Um ... you? Okay. Lay down. On the belly. Turn around. Is everything okay - Do not know. I think yes. Okay. What are you doing exactly - What? What are you doing exactly Ride to O-Town. That felt good. I have to do that more often. Does your husband live here too? He lives in Darmstadt with his assistant. The bitch with the boobs? - Yes. The bitch with the boobs. Good night. Then it's your turn. Fuck! This is my man. How, is he calling now? Well, it's morning in China now. Shit, I have to take it now. Are you staying like this? Are you waiting? yeah Hi sweetheart. I'm not even home yet. I'm with Ingrid. And. We are currently digging up the garden. The ground is very solid. Everything okay? - Yes. Right now on the phone with her husband in China. Papa's favorite music. Yes, I know. All the hard and irascible things went away with the illness. It’s really so ... soft in the end. Couldn't look me in the eye anymore as if he was ashamed. In the end it turned out to be funny. - That can not be. But. When we knew it was going to end when papa didn't eat anymore the pastor came to support him. He said: "So, Mr. Schneider, we are now going on a long journey to the other bank. " Dad looks at him like this: "Oh, are you coming with me?" The pastor was so very hectic: "Ha noi, she goes first, I 'll follow you later." Papa really loved you. I know you don't believe it, but it is. He was simply overwhelmed without mom. He's been asking about you the last time . "Did Christian get in touch? Did he call? What about Christian?" You never got in touch. Have you never considered moving away? Sure, of course. - Why didn't you do it? Someone had to take care of Papa. I mean before he got sick. Yes, I mean that too. Even so, in the village, Papa only talked about you. That his Christian makes a career. Travels around the world and earns a lot of money. I can kill him. Phones in the middle of the night to have his cufflinks sent after him . What's going on here? - huh? Nothing. Come on, we're not done yet. (Music: "Love Survive" by Michael Nau) That must have been a night with the ute. How so? Because you've been in such an irritatingly good mood all day . Yeah, it was pretty good. Come on! Doesn't just always work on command, right? The other day the urologist said that this is normal at our age. Have you ever been to the pension plan? - Let me concentrate. I have an idea. Dare you! - rule 3. George! - Just come after me. Georg. Come over! Nick-nick-nick. Oh come on It's just consistent. We had sex. So ... yeah, we had sex. We had alcohol, and now ... Calimera. So, for our hungry guests. One suflaki and the grape leaves. So what else do we have? Once Suflaki, Tarama, Zaziki, Moussaka. Special steak, Special gyros, Rhodes plate, Hercules grill, Poseidon skewer. And the... Ah, here she comes. And the Venus plate. So do we have everything? Guten Appetit. - Efharisto. Efharisto - Guten Appetit. I don't know if we gotta make every stupid idea that we had when we were 15 years old. - But. Top. For the benefit. A little dessert. On the house, of course. Oh... Hey! Bravo! May I tell you something personal? Yes, ready. Your moped is really ugly. Yes I know. But you used to say it wasn't ugly. The truth is it was a lie. It had that long back seat and I had imagined that Tanja could go along. You bought the ugly moped especially, and then the tännle didn't go along at all? That turned out to be shitty. Yes, you can say that. - Has it been going that long? Why did you never ask? - What? Well, whether she wants to go. Somehow there was never the right moment. Ask her now. She is married. I know it doesn't count in your world, but it does in mine. Happily married? - No, on the contrary. Some things are just not meant to be. But with the setting you don't fly to the moon either. But you've already had relationships, so ...? To women, I mean. Probably not as many as you, but yes. - Definitely not. Show-off. (Belch) Come on, let's go in. - Nope. But! - No, I'm going down there. After the Greek is before the Greek. - I do not want. No! Arschbombe! (Music: "Death With Dignity" by Sufjan Stevens) Once again! Huhu! Mann, ey! Do you want to ride? Is better than it looks. - Where are you going? At the Baltic Sea. And you want to go to Paderborn? - Yes, towards Paderborn. What do you do there? - I'm going to a root festival. On what? - A root festival. So, the festival where you go back to the roots. And what are you doing at the Baltic Sea? - Pee in the sea. Ah. Okay, cool. Adam! I'm willie This is Adam. Hello. I am Georg. - Hi, Georg. And you? Christian. - Hi, Christian. Yeah cool thanks. - Get on. Do we also make dream catchers? You can also do expression dance. Or build flowers out of trash. - That works too. I think I'm doing laughter yoga. - Ey! That's real. I saw it in Singapore. And what is this about? Do you have some kind of common agenda? First and foremost, it's about experiencing things together. These can also be simple things, like listening. There's a listening tent over there. Or experience nature together. Do rituals. And just celebrate together. Back to the roots. We call ourselves the root family. - But there's nothing religious about that? But already. But more in a spiritual sense. So what more active. Does that mean you believe in God? I can't speak for the others there is no contract, but I do. Maybe more like an ... an energy that holds everything together. I believe in the afterlife. - Yes? Me too. Really? - I think the soul is infinite and wanders from body to body. And depending on what she wants to learn she looks for other souls. For example, you looked for your brother and your parents. My after-life beliefs are rather selfish. More like a cost-benefit calculation. The annual bonus. It would be pretty stupid not to take advantage of that. But you are an extraordinary guy. You could start with me right away. 100,000 flat in the first year. 100,000? Then am I alone in Singapore? There are so many others. - Okay, for me. Alone with the others who are lonely earning money. No thanks. Maybe better if you stick with your root family. - Yes. And you? You are over 40 and drive through Germany on a moped. Don't tell me this has nothing to do with your life. - Right. You're right. I'm taking a break from my life. But so does Georg, and he leads a completely different life. I don't need a break from my life. - Yes, he just doesn't know yet. You just happen to take two hitchhikers with you and get a life lesson. Okay, no stupid comments now . I Agree? - Yes. I don't think you drove past us by accident. We are not? - no Things happen because we want them and not just by accident. You believe in this too, Adam? - Sure, that's why we sit here. That means we met because you wanted to? Or... because there's a reason You wanted it too. And what is the reason? Wait and see. You guys have family? Any kids? - No. And you? - No family, but I have a kid. What? - Yes a son. But the mother and I we split up before he was born. Do you have contact? To be honest, I've never seen him. Have you never seen him? - Nope. And why have you never said anything about it? It's not such a glorious story. Experience with drugs? I use crystal meth to work in the carpentry shop. It was a joke. Really, I was kidding. You want some? You said I should be more adventurous. But I don't know if I meant Mdma at the root festival. Oah! Christian? Christian? On? I really allowed him to do it. When you wrote to me that dad had cancer ... The first thing I thought ... The first thing that crossed my mind was: "Serves him right." Is not bad. Are you doing well? Min. You have a son. This is so beautiful. I would also like to have a son. Or a daughter. I don't care. - You still get it. I have missed you so much. Really. So doll. I love you. Enough. - I just want to say that now. I love you. Georg, that's enough. It's so good that we're making the trip. That is fine. And. (Music: "Happiness" by Jonathan Jeremiah) Crap. That makes 15 euros for each of you for driving without a helmet. I beg your pardon? You hunted down two felons. Keep up the good work and I'll look at your license plates. It's only available in the technology museum. From now on you have to push your motor vehicles. I beg your pardon? - You got it right. You slide until you have helmets. - You can't do that. We are here in the middle of nowhere. - But. And how do you want to control whether we push or not? Do you want to escort us to the national border or what? Fuck you, Lower Saxony! Fuck you! You ugly, shitty state! I hope you will miss out on the next state financial equalization! That was North Rhine-Westphalia. - I don't give a shit. The depressing thing is when I ... This is really frustrating: Nobody wonders if something happened to me. They don't even think about it. How old is your son? 15 or maybe even 16. Not sure how old your son is? - Mm. And we share a DNA. Shocking. But you know what his name is? Very funny. Konrad. Konrad. Does he look like you? You don't even know what he looks like? As I said, it's not a hero story. You don't have a photo? - Georg, I didn't want a child. I got a job in London, Lisa wanted the kid, so we broke up. To be honest, I just left more or less. And have you never regretted that? I do not know. I don't know what to regret. I haven't seen it. I think Willie is right. You are not happy with your life. Are you happy then Quite a flexible term, happiness. I make a lot of money, you don't. Your neighbors give you baskets of food. Who is happier? Have you ever thought of quitting? - Sure, everyone thinks of that. "Another four years, then I'll have enough money and work pro bono for an NGO." But nobody stops because ... you don't change anymore at that age. I think we're going to visit your son. Where does he live? Berlin. - Almost on our way. That is completely not on our way. - It's my turn to make decisions. Berlin is right on our way. - That's a 250 km detour. This is total bullshit. Oh, parachute or plane only applies to the others? Listen, Georg, we're not going to visit my son. Christian... - Not "Christian". That's a shitty idea and I'm not going to do it. Why don't you want to get to know him? - Oh, Georg! So you don't wanna get to know your son - Yes, of course. But at some point it doesn't work anymore. Why not? - Is it that hard? He's definitely not in the mood for me to suddenly find myself standing there after 15 years. You do not even know that. - Now stop! Nothing works with the tännle, you have no children, terrible, but don't make me meet my son. You are a real asshole. Ey! You didn't report to papa, not to me, and now you do the same shit with your son Now hold the edge! - no! You may have a lot of money and you've seen the whole world but you still haven't got it: man, you have a son! Stop it! - no! First say you regret not having met him. Be honest with yourself for once. - Yes. What yes? - Yes, I regret it. Your penis is on my stomach. Was? Your member lies on my stomach. I know we're brothers, but that's kind of perverted anyway. (Music: “Green Mountefln Road“ by Adam Torres) After 15 years, even one night doesn't matter. You wanted me to visit my son. But not that we drive to Berlin tired at night . That was your idea, I have nothing to do with it. Here it is. What here? No, ey, Georg! - Yes, come on. Let's wait and see. Waiting? I didn't drive all night and then wait. Don't argue about it now, Georg. Let's sit down here. Please do what I tell you. That's silly. I'm not a private detective. I'm going over there now. - Ey! He looks like you. Do you find? That's you in small. I don't see anything there. It's way too fat. Maybe because he doesn't have a father. Again: irony is not your thing. Don't you wanna go to him (Woman screams) Hugo! Do you stop fiddling and get going ! Man, the same theater every morning ! My son's name is Konrad, not Hugo. Looks like me, yeah? I already found it. - Ass. How do you know they live here? It's the last address I have. And how long ago was that? Well, as I said: 15, 16 years. 15, 16 years and we sit here and wait? I'm going over there now. Yes, nothing "Georg". I'll just take a closer look at it now. Silesian Gate. Exit on the right. And? Yes nothing "and". Plays football. - does he play well? Yeah, it's pretty good. - Does he play very well? Yes, plays very well. And with you? - Yes... Can you kick the ball back for us? - Yeah, sure. Crap! Wait. Ah, it doesn't exist! - You can throw it too. Yes, ready. Sorry Do you want to play against us? Yes. - Georg. Are you from a funeral? - Yes. But it's been a few days. Then why are you still wearing your suits? Because we're drunk on our mopeds and have been across Germany once. Any rules? - Nope. Only those who complain have to go out. But not that you cry afterwards. - Let's see who's crying here. 1:0. (Music: "All The Luch In The World“ by Never) Damn! Georg! No! Quick, line! I do it alone. Ja-haha! hot! No! Can't do anything! That doesn't make sense, four against two. One more comes to us. You come to us. - If it has to be. What is your name? - Konrad. Konrad. - And you? I am Georg, this is my brother Christian. - Hello. Do it! Go then. No! Ja! - Yeah! And! Do you play in a club? - Yes. Which one? - Nice oak. You also? - Yeah, but not with such a bad one. Pisser. - And why are you painting your fingernails? I had to babysit the neighborhood kids. Is that what you do in Berlin, yes? - Take a look at those two. They are cute. They are really famous here. - How so? They were married for over 30 years and then he got Alzheimer's, she took care of him forever. At some point she had to register him in the old people's home. A year later she also got Alzheimer's and went to the same home. They just don't know each other anymore, and the cool thing is the man gets up every morning and falls in love with his wife again. Oh nonsense. - But! He goes to breakfast and she falls in love with him too. Like a chemical reaction. Then they are here in the park, holding hands, totally in love but the next morning they don't know anything about it. That's not true. - But. You made that up. - That's so. Come on - How am I supposed to come up with something like that? Is the story true? - Yes. She is wrong! - But. But told really well. I fell for it. No way. Okay, we have to go now, I think. Or? You did pretty well. Ciao. Bye Bye. You can save yourself the paternity test. Imagine that there really would be that you keep forgetting everything and every day is a new life. How are you now? - What do you mean, "what's next"? Well what do you want to do now? Now we're going to the Baltic Sea. That's it? One time playing football is enough? I know you mean well, but that annoys me. If you go now, you will never see her again. Stop it now! I can not. Do not you understand that? Didn't you see that they are happy? If I ring the bell now, I'll break it again, like 15 years ago. That's not true. - But it's true. This is my one week of freedom, my week of NGO. But I'm going back to Singapore in a day or two or wherever they want me. I don't have the strength and I'm too old to change anything. You are so cowardly. I am a coward? I'll tell you who's a coward: It's you. We could have walked together back then. - You ran away! I've asked you so many times if you're coming with me. Yes, Georg takes responsibility, takes care of papa. That's great, but no one ever made you so don't blame anyone else . Because this "I had to and had no choice" is so much more cowardly. Get out of your dump or stay there, but do it because you want it not because anyone expects you to. You can't even tell the girl that you've been loving her for fucking 30 years just because her fucking husband or someone in your back town could somehow get it wrong. Should i call? Then you call them first. And don't just point your finger at others. That's how you see it. - That's how everyone sees it, Georg. Maybe it's a good thing we have n't seen each other for 30 years. Yes, it might be quite good. Good luck in Singapore or wherever they want you. Oh Mann. Olli! Until tomorrow. Sleep well. Bye Bye. Hello? Hello Lisa ... Hello, it's Christian. Which Christian? - Ch-Christian Schneider. Christian. I don't know ... Am I disturbing? You, I'm having dinner with friends. It's bad right now. Yes? I can't make a phone call right now. Take care. Lisa? - Um, I'm not out to dinner with friends. I don't know why I said that. I'm sorry. How are you? My father died, I'm in Germany right now. I'm sorry. Are you in the black forest? Uh ... yes and no. Is complicated. Okay. How are you? Gut. Very good. - And Konrad? Christian, that doesn't work. Really not. You can not... just ... call here ... Yes I know. Should ... should I hang up? - I do not know. Maybe. No. It's so weird to hear your voice. I agree. Total. Did you actually do your doctorate? How do you get it now? I don't know, just like that. Because you were so insecure then. Yes, I made it. It took a while, quite a long while but i have it, yeah Well, congratulations. I'm really happy. What do you want christian? Why are you calling? I do not know. I ... I just wanted to get in touch. You just wanted to get in touch? You call me after 15 years because you want to know if I finished my studies? Are you serious, yes? It can't be, Christian. Do you know the last time Konrad asked where you are? That was ten years ago. Nobody needs you here to just get in touch. Did you understand that? I will end the call now. And. Take care. (Music: "Cormorant Bird" by Fionn Regan) Yes! - Very good. Go play! Go your thing! - Clean. Dumbbell! - Man! Clean! Ball! - "dumbbell." They call him “dumbbell.” Apparently his nickname. Ha? Who did it? Dumbbell! Fits. Once again. - Yes! Do you have Pippi in the eyes? And! Learned from the master, right? - Running, fat man. What? - yeah what what? What are you looking at, you watchtower? You play shit. Play better or what? - 100 euros better. Then show the coal. Fuck, I only have 20. I'm going to get some money. All right. Fuck off! 20 and the mopeds. Junior, do you still need mopeds? - Let's take it, papa. All right. Bat! You're done, bye. Ha! Come on, girls. Shave your legs or something? So, we'll play until 11. Change of service after each point. Loser begins. Come over. Dumbbell, play! - Yes! Yes! Again like that. - Your thing, dumbbell! Ja!Ja!Ja!Ja! Say goodbye to your mopeds. 2: 0! Nice! Yes! - Running, dumbbell. 3: 0! Yes! - fuck! Dumbbell! 4:0! Ha! Yes! That was the 5! - Nice. 5:0. What about your hand - Nothing, do it. We don't actually play against disabled people. It's not the Paralympics. Oh boy! What's wrong with you? Crap! Hol den Ball! What's that? Go on. (Dumbbell) Shut up! (Music: "Maschin" by Bilderbuch Uber stummer Szene) 9:9. Ja! 10: 9. - What? That was edge. What? - Yes, 10: 9 for us, Kante. That was outside. I guess it's a joke! 100%. Was the edge? (all) Sure! It's the joke of the century! - Let. Ey! - 'Sorry. 10:10, next point wins. Penner! Now pull yourself together. Come over! Yes! - Ja! Ja! Ja, Mann! Ja! Ja! Ja! Nice thing! Yes! Splendid. Running! - Nice. Yes! So, the keys. Wasn't that bad after all, Stephen Hawking. By the way, you can't knock over cows at all. Says who? - I say. I've tried it. Maybe you need a special technique. Yes, perhaps. We have to get them back. The journey has a purpose, Georg. But only if we really finish it. And that's why we have to get the mopeds back. Never man! No way! That's just anabolic steroids. It's just proteins. Fat is that. Georg. Oh shit. Okay what's the plan? The plan is you go in and find the keys. No i'm going I missed the penalty. I already think so. Christian. Good luck. Only mass, but speed is required. Na klar. How it's going! Look at the fat one! - (Junior) He'll do it. It's just fat! 50 meters and it's flat. Get a beer. Those shit owls again! Man! Thank you boy They have nothing on it. They have nothing on it! Nothing behind it. - But the other one? Da, der Kleene. The one with the red t-shirt. Killer look. Of the? He's got arms like a match. - We'll see. Look at the fat one. It's just fat. - Shh! Fuck! Come over! Come over! - go! Fuck you! Fuck you, you little wanker! But really cool, the long back seat, isn't it? - I love it! Dumbbell! Drive faster! - I'm going as fast as I can. Your pussies! Shake it off? No. - What's in his hand? I do not know. But no rifle right? - no Crap! What was that? He's crazy! He wants to kill us! Crap! Where is it? I do not know. Fuck! Fuck! What kind of person is that? Go! Go! Go! Go! Crap. - We're screwed. We do not return the moped. - Under no circumstance. What do we do now? - Drive. We'll break all of our bones. - I know. Plane or parachute? - Fuck, plane! You wanker! Your suiting! I'll get you! Crap! I'll go back now and get my knife. Georg? Are you doing well? And. And you? And. Does that count as a 20-meter wheelie downhill? And. Absolutely. Beautiful or? And. I think I have to go home slowly. The barn? The barn, yes. And you? Let's see. If Willie is right, the right thing will happen. (Music: "When The Poet Sings" by L. A. Salami) Look here. No, here. But! Goodbye! - Ade! Tschüss! Where are you from now? - From the Baltic Sea. With that thing? Do you want to ride? Now? Why not now? Hello. Hello.
