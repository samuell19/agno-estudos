They give you today, they snatch from you tomorrow. I explained that to you... ...but you wouldn't listen. You back ed down on destiny. Maybe it was my cock's time. My God! His time, my ass! It was fixed. Did you think that cock fights were all straight? I warned you right away. Not fixed. Who would want to harm me? The man who weighted him. I bet that bastard crack ed his ribs. But my Blondy behaved bravely. He fought until the end. Well, you know that. I want you to come with me as my releaser. What are you going to do? I pay very well. Either you bend or you'll be out of the fight... ...as it just happened to you. You only had one cock. What will you do? Sell enchiladas or what? It showed that you were starving. You filled your belly up with chili, man. Now you're eating well, aren't you? Or what? Work? No fucking way! It shows that you're not fit for that, man. Well, I'm not perfect, either. Don't you see this fucking leg? I become lame as soon as it starts raining. That's the way things are. We are not fit for working. You are useful for the boss. You know about animals. You are good at that. Besides, no one knows you. Relax... ...and don't close your legs. You become our releaser and we give you money, right? You already bit the bait. You already bit it. This is Mr. Gil. He knows everything about everything. Mr. Gil. Mr. Gil, don't fall asleep. Didn't I tell you to keep this clean? Damn it, man! Look, he is Dionisio Pinzon. He will be my releaser. This is a fucking mess! Oh, no! Not like that! No... no... From top to bottom. Use your palms, softly, like this. The animal doesn't even notice when you crack... ...his ribs. Your dry hand will be useful, it can't be seen. You don't have to worry. Everything's fixed from the start. Fucking fatso! He look ed like a rabid dog! So you had a big problem? I'm glad you came here. This way you can work with me. There's room enough in here. This used to be a fucking school. A school for the rich, and everything. A boarding school. And if that fatso lays hands on you, he'll kill you! Now you can't escape... ...we'll play every day at 19:30. You just tell me what to do, Mr. Lorenzo. Don't worry. Caponera... I bring her to please our eyes, Pinzon. Hi, Ms. Bernarda. We missed you a lot in fairs. I've been here, just keeping my man company. I'll bring you some drinks. This is my playing table, Pinzon. - Take a seat. - Thank you. Here you will learn everything about cards. This one's for the pool. Four. A jack. Jack. Six... horse... ...seven... two... ...jack. I got the winner again, Mr. Lorenzo. You're right. You learn fast, Pinzon... ...you learn fast... - Stop and eat something. It will be dawn soon, the maid is up already. Okay, woman. You shuffle. Benavides... wasn't San Juan del Rio's fair these days? Really... it started three days ago. It is really beautiful. I like it. You learnt really fast, man! Bernarda, tell Diego to bring the car... ...and say good-bye to my friend. Good luck, Dionisio. Have a nice time. You are really good at it, aren't you? Those fucking surprises you gave me... MOLINA FUNERAL PARLOR Look at it. This one is the best. Look what a perfect finish. It can't be broken, not even jerking it. Jerk it... jerk it! Careful! Jelly! Jelly! Come on, Mrs. Iris, bring me a beer... ...just like these men's. Because I can afford them now, too. Even if you're surprised. My beer... and many more, if I want them. What, Damian? What are you looking at, man? You envy my clothes, right? They are very good, they were expensive. But now I have money. That's why I brought my mom her coffin. Look at it: R ed laces, silver ornaments. Just what you heard: Silver for Dionisio's mom. You can't say I buried her like a dog. That's why I came back to this... starved town. And swallow your anger... ...you fuckers... ...because now I have the money. Don't you want another beer, Mr. Dionisio? "Mr. Dionisio." That sounds good, "Mr. Dionisio". This used to be my house.
