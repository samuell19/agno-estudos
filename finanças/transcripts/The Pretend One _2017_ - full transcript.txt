What type of tea will it be today? Earl grey, English breakfast? Earl grey, please. No. I think we'll give you something more exotic. Chamolee, yes, it will help you with your complexion. Would you like to pass me your cup? No? You're not going to try it? But it's so good. Brat, cut it out. Suit yourself. Do you want it? Stop it, brat. You very well know I can't catch it. Charlie.

I'm gonna get rid of that clock, I reckon you'd make a better noise. Probably. You could sing me a song, or something. ♪ Wake up, brat ♪ ♪ today is the tomorrow you thought about yesterday ♪ That's terrible. Yeah well, I'm not your bedside accessory. Maybe I should throw you out. Maybe I need to Chuck you out. How are you gonna do that? Workin' on it. Won't need the likes of you. Yeah, good luck with those crusty farmers. Feeling pretty limber today. Like you can't get far without me! Hey, hey! Droppers! You son of a. They were open mouth kissing this time. Got you a beer. How can you find that funny, brat? Just because I'm laughing, doesn't make it funny. I'll give you something to laugh at. Okay, there was this really protective farmer, right? And he had three daughters. At 5:30 Friday night, there was a knock at the door. The farmer answers it with his shotgun, and the guy at the door says, hello, my name's eddy. I'm here for Betty, we're going for spaghetti, is she ready? The farmer pauses and then lets him go with Betty in tow, and then a little bit later, the farmer answers the door again, 'cause there was another knock at the door, and the guy at the door says, hello, my name's Joe, I'm here for flo, we're going to the show, is she ready to go? The farmer pauses, and goes, yeah, she's ready, and lets her go too. And then about half an hour later, there's another knock at the door, and the guy at the door says, hello, my name's Chuck, and then... Sorry, did I do something funny? What are you... Really? Right at the punchline. No, sorry, I'm just trying to remember a joke. Is it because you've got two beers - that you can't remember it? - No, don't let this guy... - That's not mine. - Judge you. Okay, so, tell me. Tell you what? What? The joke. - No. - Nah. - You don't wanna hear it. - I do. What if it's not funny? It is funny if you tell it right. I'll pretend that it is. Pretend. - Okay. - Okay. Okay, let's all do it. So... Okay, there's this farmer, and there's a knock at the door, and he says, hi, eddy, you here for spaghetti? Well he doesn't know him yet. Okay, sorry, that's wrong. Yeah, it's wrong. Start over. Okay, eddy's at the door, and he asked for Betty to come for spaghetti. - No. - And then there's a Joe, and a flo, and they're going to the snow. Show. And then Chuck comes to the door, and... I'm not sure. The farmer shoots him? Yeah, well that is how it ends. I'm guy. So. Or not. Your name is? Charlie, let's go. Here. - Thanks. - That was mine. It was nice to meet you, guy. It's poisoned. Charlie. Glad we'll never have to see him again. Did you see that tie? It looked like a cat sicked up on it. City folk. Middle! I made this for you. It's your hero badge, because I know that you've always got my back whenever I need it. Can I wear it? Yeah sure, of course I can't wear it. What do you think? Nice, looks good on you. That's enough! Enough, Charlie! Stop it! Stop talking to yourself! You need help. Now, Charlie, I want you to relax, and close your eyes. Now I want you to pretend that you're floating. Imagine yourself rising up off the couch, you sail around the room. You look down on everyone, it's wonderful. You feel you can go higher, so you burst through the front door to freedom. And as you float up into the sky, higher and higher, everything goes very quiet, and peaceful. You're in the clouds. You can feel them. And so you lie back, and relax. And as you relax, you feel yourself getting sleepy. You let it go through your whole body, like a warmth, drifting through your veins, you drift off to the soothing tone of my voice. What's your favorite color, Charlie? Blue. Mine too. And how do you like to spend your spare time? - Go swimming. - How fun. Who's your best friend, Charlie? Hugo. Where's Hugo now? Over there in the corner. Is he an imaginary friend? No, he's my real friend. Then why can't I see him? Only I can... Charlie, it's because he's not real. Hugo's only pretend, which is fine for when you're little, but you're a big girl now. Bored! Hot! Yeah, I know. Swimming! You know dad won't give us any time off, it's picking season. It's always some type of season. Yeah, well that's just the way it is, stop complaining. Why doesn't Roger get any more helping? 'Cause he doesn't like strangers on the farm. Who's that then? Maybe we could have a little break. Yes! No swimming. - Come on. - Come on. You know, my grandmother lived down in yurrebilly. So, I lived there 'til I was eight. Yurrebilla. - Place. - Yeah. Guy, this is my daughter, Charlie. Yeah, it's good to see you again. - Hi. - Hi. We met the other night at the pub. What's funny bones doing here? Guy is a pilot for the abc. No, no, I don't actually fly, I'm making a pilot for the abc. It's like the test episode in a tV. Series, to see if it works. Yeah. And the one I'm making is a documentary about single farmers living in rural areas. And the relationship that the have with the land, so... Sounds boring. That sounds really interesting. Yeah, it's kind of like, I guess, like a response to the whole, apps, bone apps dating thing, you know? Like Internet dating? Yeah, sort of, yeah. Yeah. So, what do you want from us? I've gotta interview some locals, and I was hoping that Roger might be interested. Wonder why he chose your dad. Nah, no, mate, I don't think I've got a good face for camera. Come on, dad, it'd be great. Yeah, you know, it would air nationally, so who knows, rog? Sorry, Roger. Mr. Alderton. Alderton's the name of the farm, mate. You tell him, rog. Right, sorry. Get out. You okay? Yeah, I was just thinking through it. I think it sounds really great. Yeah, no, sorry. It's not for me, guy. But dad, you haven't even been on one date. Charlie. Sorry to waste your time, all right, mate. We've got a lot on here at the moment. Weather's coming in, we've gotta get the cotton in. Yeah, of course. Totally understand. It's nice to meet you, Roger. Yeah, all right. I'm really sorry, look, I didn't meant to get you in trouble. No it's fine, his bark's worse than his bite. Okay. So, do you think maybe then I should come back again? No. By, yeah. Okay, well I've got a... That's me, my phone number's on there, so if you... Why would you? But if you need anything, just give me a call. Yeah. Okay, take it easy. You take it easy too. Okay, see ya, bye. Bye. Why did I have to go outside? You know why. You can't do that in front of people. Do you love him? What? No, how could I love him? I've only just met him. Yeah, that's what I thought. Yeah, so why'd you say it? It's stupid. Too soon for love. - What? - First dumb bloke in town. Yeah, so, I don't even know him. Charlie, let's go. Don't want those men in white coats to come and get me, do we? Scoot. Pass me the 22. How long you think it'll take? I don't know, I'll get it done today though. I'll take your ute, then. Where you going? Into town for a bit. You gonna try out for that show? Water pump's gone on one of the headers. Where's your keys? Go on dad, it'd be fun. Where's your keys. Just there. So stubborn. Apple doesn't fall far from the tree. I think I'm more like my mom. Yeah? How's that? I'm funny like her. How do you know? You don't remember her. I remember her. I remember bits of her. You're my subconscious. Get in there and dig some out. I can't just go rummaging around in there like it's bunnings. You're bloody useless then, aren't you? You're. Why don't you ask Roger about her? Can you pass us the hammer and punch? Sorry, that was a bit shit, wasn't it? It's all right, you can still move things in my world. What does skin feel like? I don't know, it feels like... Cotton. That feels like cotton? Okay, well, it can be rough sometimes, and then smooth, and... Oily? What does that feel like? It feels like when we go swimming in the dam and you get all wet. But you can't, okay. It feels like... Feels like... It feels like when we were climbing that big tree in the back paddock, and that storm came in, and the wind picked up, and you're standing on this branch, and you feel like you could fall at any moment, and you've got flies in your guts, and it's scary, and... Exciting. And but you like it? Yeah, it's okay. Yeah, I would like that. Do you wanna choose a movie tonight? - Ghost. - Not again. Swims? - Yeah. - Yeah. You got a better joke? You didn't get the last one, so. - Yes I did. - No you didn't, you butchered it. No I didn't, you just told it badly. No, I get it. Eddie rhymes with spaghetti. Yeah. And then Joe rhymes with flo, and they're going to the show, or something. And then Chuck rhymes with. Yeah, see, funny joke. Funny joke, now. Isn't it? No. How would I know what it was gonna be, I've never. Well, I've never. Come on. Come on! Come on! ♪ Swam ♪ ♪ across ♪ ♪ the river ♪ ♪ on ♪ ♪ a road ♪ ♪ that never ends ♪ ♪ Down ♪ So you can't touch anything? Nope. Try and touch me. Come on. But I see you moving things all the time. That's just you imagining it, it only happens while you're watching. I'll try to fix that. I think dad's back. You coming? Yep. What are you doing? Nothing. Are you peeing? - No. As if. I'm just gonna hang out here for a bit longer. Suit yourself. - Guy. - Hi. Hi. Hi, sorry, I didn't think anyone was here. - Hi. Dad's just gone to town. I'm doing the interviews. Good on you. I mean, I'm doing the interviews on Wednesday at the pub. It's you. Great. Yeah, and I thought I'd ask your dad if he changed his mind, so. Well, thanks mate, we'll tell him you dropped by. Well, you could tell him yourself. I thought you said he wasn't here. Yeah, yeah. I mean, you could wait here, and then you could ask him to come yourself, if you don't have anything else to do. You know, it's probably better coming from you actually. You know, yeah, that'd be great. Yeah, I'd like that. Yay. Cool. Sorry. - Why? - What for? I'm not very interesting. Yes you are, he isn't. Not everybody's the story, just part of the book. - What? - What? It's something my dad used to say when we moved to a new town. - Dumb. - That's sweet. Thanks. Come on, brat, we better go. We've got work to do. Roger sees you sitting on your ass when he comes back, he'll blow his freakin' top. - How long are you here for? - For a week. Is that rain? If the rain tucked in... You okay? Yeah, I just thought I was gonna sneeze. There you go. Thanks. That's nice. It's really weird being back here. What do you mean? I'm from here. - No you're not. - Yeah I am. - What? - Yeah. I grew up at yurrebilla. Really? Yeah, my dad and moved when I was pretty young, so, yeah. Why would anyone wanna move away from here? I think it's got its perks. Do you... That suit is really beautiful. Sorry, are you wanting some help? It's just an old suit of my dad's. - Really? - Yeah. It's really nice. Can I take you to dinner, plase? Dinner. Yeah, I need someone to help me with paperwork, and the truth is, I can't get anyone to talk to me. I don't fit in anymore. Well, farmers are pretty tough butts to crack. Plus they probably think you're a bit of a yuppie on account of your suit. You just said you liked the suit. No, I do... But I just, I mean do I look like a crusty farmer? No, you do not. So, tonight? Seven o'clock? I'll pick you up. - Okay. - Pub? There's nowhere else to go. There's nowhere else to go. Hey also, do you think you could work on your dad for me? I think he'd be really good. Yeah, sure. Great, I'll see you then, then. See you later. Your hankie. No, keep it. See ya. You sent me away. Yeah well, you were being really annoying. So what, you just get rid of me? I'm not your puppet. No, it's not like that. Even best friends need some time apart sometimes. You promised you'd never send me away again. Well you didn't give me much of a choice. You don't know what it's like, why didn't you just ask me to get lost? I couldn't just tell my imaginary friend to get lost in front of guy, could I? Why not? Because people who do that get locked up, and I'm not gonna let that happen. Fine. Fine. You need to grow up. No. Charlie, do you love your dad? Yes. Then you don't want the men in white coats to come and take you away from him, do you? So you'd better stop believing in imaginary friends. I'm going to count down from three. When you hear one, you'll wake up. You will not see Hugo anymore. You do not need Hugo, Hugo is not real. Do you understand, Charlie? Three. Two. Brat? Charlie? Charlie! One. Concentrate. Fuck! Guess we're not watching a movie. I've gotta go and help guy find some locals to talk to. Guess you don't want me there, then. No, I'm gonna do it by myself. It's not a big deal, we're just going to the pub. Why are you putting on lipstick, then? Doesn't hurt to make a good impression, does it? You look nice. Don't make me kiss you. Shit. Shit, shit, shit. What time did he say? Now, I guess. Will you be having dinner there? Yeah, probably. What sort? It think it's like, lamb tonight, or something? Is it? - Entrees? - Yeah, maybe. Lamb. - Hi. - Hi. Am I early? No, I'm ready to go. Cool, you've... You just, you missed. What? Don't, you can do it in the car. Yeah. - Thanks. - All right. Hey, you should definitely talk to bill mack. I think he's about 85, he's never been married, he doesn't have any girlfriend. I remember this guy. He's a little touched, right? Like, he mumbles to himself all the time? Yeah, I mean, he's harmless, he's just a bit lonely I think. Yeah, everyone's got a story. Put him on the pile. On the pile, yeah. - Cheers. - Cheers. Can I ask you something? - Yeah. - Okay. What are you doing here? What do you mean? I mean... Why are you here? Why would you come here? 'Cause, okay... I'm intrigued. It's because, okay... This is like, the most connected time in history, right? Where you can get anything you want with the click of a mouse, it gets delivered to your house, and that includes love. Half my friends met their partners online, and then got this other community, and you're so isolated, and I... I wanna know what makes you tick. Yeah. Lots of stuff. And I guess it seems like it might be hard. Sometimes. And people says that farmers are really hot, even if they are tough butts to crack. That's not a saying. You said it just the other night. Yeah, but not here. You're totally stitching me out. - Hey, rog. Kicked off. So why do you think so many of the guys are still single? It's like, okay... So this is you, my beer's you, and this is your farm, and you're driving around, by yourself, late at night, and you're miles away from home, and the ute breaks down. What are you gonna do? Fix the ute. Yeah, fix the ute. It's like, in rural communities, people don't discard things, they make what they have work, even if what they have is no one. All they have is loneliness, and it's beautiful. And it's a little sad. We should talk to Bob as well, he's a bit quiet. I think he'd be good. Sure, great. I'm gonna need some manly advice, mate. See, I've got this friend who likes this girl. You don't know her, but it's like she doesn't take him seriously. It's like, how do you show a girl that you're man enough for her? Or do you just keep it cool and let her come to you? Yeah. I think you're probably right. Yeah. That's weird. You must meet all kinds of people at your work. It's just so exciting and so glamorous, and everyone's beautiful. It's not glamorous. Such fun. It's fun, it's fun, but it's long hours, and it's crappy pay, it's lots of admin. Yeah, but you get to wear a suit, don't you? - So. - Okay, stop, tell me. You gotta tell me. What is with the suit thing? Nothing. Liar. - What's with the suit thing? - Nothing. Tell me. No, okay, okay. You have to promise not to laugh. I promise. I... When I was a kid, out of all the jobs that I possibly could have had, what do you think I wanted to be? A Princess? Yuck. Fire woman? No, weirder. Care bear. Care bear? You said weirder. That's really weird. Hr. What? I wanted to work in hr. Like human resources? Yeah. I was obsessed. I used to do all my dad's filing and paperwork, and I'd write reports about how the dogs were supposed to behave, and I'd interview all my toys. None of them were ever qualified, it was. You promised me you wouldn't laugh at me. It's cute. No, it's lame, I know that it's lame. It's not, it's not. No. I just really wanted to work in an office and wear a suit. Suits get really uncomfortable after a while. Yeah, I wouldn't care. My mom, she used to advise companies on managing farmers moving into the workplace. So, she'd go into the city, and we'd stay in hotels, and get those little shampoo bottles, and tell all the men what to do, and everyone would listen to her. I just think suits get you treated like royalty. - That's lame. - It's nice. You should... - We should get Jack tay. - Yeah? He gets drunk every weekend, and he runs down the main street naked. Brilliant, I like to do that too, so we could spend the night together. He looks handsome too. Okay, okay. You give these guys enough beer they'll do anything. You can get interviews? That idea about the bar tab's a stroke of genius. Yeah, wish I didn't have to work tomorrow, I wish I could see it. Yeah, me too. Can I tell you something really embarrassing? Absolutely. Okay, okay. When... I may have had a bit of a crush on you. Did we know each other? Barely. I was a bit older, but there was one day, we were at the pub, and you were inside, and I was outside playing, and I wanted to come in and grab you, and I went in to see if I could get you to come outside and play, and I kissed you. You didn't seem to like it much, though, so. Jesus, Charlie.

It was cold, it was really cold this time. Hugo, I promise you, I didn't send you away. I was never supposed to go back. I wasn't supposed to go back there. I didn't send you to that place. It was guy then. He made you send me. No, you're being ridiculous. I would never tell guy about you. 'Cause you're ashamed of me. I don't want you seeing him again. That's not your decision. I don't care! I'm telling you that. Yeah, and how are you gonna stop me? Fuck! Night, rog. Bloody weather man. Only job where you're paid to be wrong. We'll keep them in the shed. Hey, g'day, guys. First, thanks for coming. I think you know what we're all trying to do today, so I'll be speaking to you all individually in the back room. Yeah, you ain't taking me in the back room. If you could all... If you could all see Charlie here, she's gonna have some forms for you to fill out before we can get you on camera. Where's the beer? Yeah. If you're feeling a little camera shy, there is a bar tab. So please, have a couple of beers. Why don't you shut up, then? That went well. I thought you were working. Yeah, I just figured you couldn't do it without me. So what have I got to do? There you go. Okay, can we just get your name for camera? Bob. Last name, Bob? It's just Bob. Okay. Jack tee. Tom Fitzpatrick. Ed boof. Can't you read? What do you think are some of your most overlooked qualities? I own my own hitter. Drinking abilities. Well, I can sympathize with how a woman feels. Don't have any. Nothing for that one? So what do you look for in a woman? Big boobs. Big round titties. Big titties, and cookin'. Well, she has to be a woman. I can't endure that again. Okay. What is your idea of a romantic evening? Gee, guys, that's a pretty good one. I don't know, few beers, back of the ute, down on the riverbank, see what happens? Have you ever been in love? No. Once. Yeah, but that failed miserably. Only woman I've ever loved is Mrs. Palmer and her five lovely daughters. Tom? No, no never been in love. Well, when do the ladies start calling? I'm sure they'll be in touch. Well another beer it is, then. I'll go and see who else is waiting. I can go if you want. No, no, it's fine, I'll grab the glasses. Okay. - See ya in a sec. - Yeah, yup. So, what are some of my most over looked qualities? Well, that's hard to say 'cause there's so many. I can't open a bottle of beer with my eye, and I've got my own hair, even if it is imaginary. Don't forget the titties. I love me some titties. That's a quality, right? Yeah. What do you look for in a lady? Didn't I say titties? Warm smile is always nice. It'd be good if she was into swimming. Scrap that, she has to be into swimming. I like 'em shy, but when you get let in, you finally crack that shell, she's the warmest, most beautiful person. She just doesn't see it. And she has to have an imagination. I could never love a girl without a big imagination. Big enough to walk around in. My idea of a romantic evening... Sitting in a rusty ute with my best mate. Have I ever been in love? Look who I found. Dad. Thought I'd get some free beer. Okay, just take a seat there, Roger. Just answer the questions honestly, and everything will be great. Camera, but you can ignore it. I don't know if I'll be much help. Whatever you can give us will be great. Bang. Okay, so... What do you think are some of your most overlooked qualities? How am I supposed to answer that? Sound like an old fuddy duddy or an arrogant prick. Sorry, guy, I told you I wouldn't be much good at this. No, no, this is good. How about... What do you look for in a woman? I think... Pigeonholing a woman's qualities just limits the surprise. A romantic evening? What passes for romance these days? Have you ever been in love, Roger? Yes, I have. Rose. She's a good woman, good mother to Charlie. She was fun. Always found ways to have fun. I never understood it, but... Nice to watch, be around. Never really understood what she saw in me. She was shy. Must have... Loved the competition. Must have pretended I was better than I am. She was creative like that. Sorry. Dad. Hey, Roger, you don't. Yeah, move. - Okay. - Sorry, sorry. Let's get a drink? Yeah. You know, you should be really proud of your dad. Took a lot of courage to come here. Charlie. I lost my mom when I was pretty young too, and I don't know what was worse, not having her around, or seeing him sink into a hole. It's like sometimes a person's record gets scratched, and they get stuck. What do you mean? Like their mind's trying to protect them. No! Charlie, it's gonna be okay. Hey, Charlie. Shit. You can't send me away anymore. Stop staring at me. This just proves I'm more real than you think. Okay, fine, Hugo, you're real. Can you please just give me some privacy? What, so you can run away with him? Hugo I... I love you, brat! Okay, yeah, I love you too. No, no, no, I'm in love with you. You can't be. He'll never know you like I do. Yeah well, at least he can touch me. Charlie, what's wrong? I'm really sorry, I've got to go. Hey hey, why are you acting so weird? She's not weird! Hey, you prick! What are you doing? Just hear me out, I can't open car doors yet, but I can move things. This isn't so crazy anymore, okay? I can move things. I need you to leave. No, I made your weight set move. I can do it on my own now without you, even now, I'm becoming real. I punched guy in the face. You did what! He called you weird. Yeah, because of you, you've made me weird. I can't be like this. I need you gone. Yeah, well you don't get to choose anymore. That's not your decision. Okay, I'm stronger than that, and I'm not going back to that place! I made you, I can end you. Why do you want to end me? Brat? Brat. Just wait. Help! Somebody help! Wait here, okay? Just wait. Help! Help, somebody! Charlie, where's the water truck? This isn't real. That's what they always told us, and we never believed them. Jesus Christ. Jesus. Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie. Charlie! - Hi. - Hello. How? I guess when you want something bad enough. What is it? What is it? What's wrong? What's wrong is I just lost my virginity to my imaginary friend. Don't call me that now. I can't, I'm losing my mind. I can't. I can't. It's not okay. It's not okay. You still believe. Brat. Brat. Brat, wait. Do you still believe? I don't know what I believe. Hi. Hey, Charlie. What the hell, what are you doing here? What are you doing here? - I was seeing if you were okay. - She's fine, mate. I took care of her last night. What happened to your head? What happened to your face? Yeah, what happened to your face? Things got rowdy in the pub last night. Hey... Charlie, I might have a job for you in the city. - What? - What? It's in hr. It's a trainee position. She's got a job, and a man, don't you? Tell him, tell him about me. Tell him, you've made your decision. I haven't made my decision! Okay. - Okay. - No, you don't understand. No, no I don't understand, but I like you. I really like you. Tell him there's someone else. We're real now. I want you to come with me. If you change your mind, I'm leaving tomorrow, so. Can't believe you didn't say anything! Hugo. Hugo, stop. Hugo. Hugo, it's. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. What the hell happened? I hit a roo last night. Why are you just telling me now? Charlie, they've all been worried sick about you. You didn't show up for work. Is that all you care about? The fucking cotton? You could have at least had the decency... You're my father, not my boss. Exactly, so I have an expectation to be included in your life. You wanna be involved, you barely even speak to me! How can I when you're always off with that boy. Guy has nothing to do with this. I'm talking about the bloody pretend one! Well you don't need to worry, I'm moving to the city. Shit. I've lived in this town for 26 years, and I've never done anything except farming. I don't wanna be a cotton farmer going to the pub every night for the rest of my life. I've never let myself be a part of the real world. And guy is that real world. Why are you taking this out on guy? What, you and guy in the city, corporate high life. Why don't you come to the city? Guy'd have you committed. Just stop this Alpha jealousy bullshit! I'm not jealous! Okay? I'm scared! I'm petrified. What are you scared of? Being forgotten. How could I ever forget you? You are my best friend in the whole world. You don't understand. I can't just wait here for you to come back, I can't just go on living a life on my own. You can't hang a picture of me on your wall, can you? If you forget me, I'm gone, that's it, I'm done. Hugo, I promised you I will never forget you. I can't. Like your mom? - So what? I'm just... I'm stuck here. Either your life ends, or mine never starts. It's not about... No, no, no, tell me, what else can I do for you, Hugo? Because I'm just here to serve you, and I've just given you life for the past 20 years at the risk of my family, my sanity, and my freedom, so what else do you wanna cost me?

Can't believe I thought this looked good. It looked good on her. Yeah, it did. She used to wear them everyday. Everyday? Yeah. Before you. Before me even. She was a high flying business woman. Why'd she stop? She was nuts. Must have felt sorry for me. How come you never told me how she died? Didn't want you to hate me? Why would I ever hate you? Because it was my fault. We were coming back from roo shooting. You were in the tray, you know, with rusty. And your mom was on my arm. Road was bumpy, it was always pretty bumpy. You used to love bouncing around back there, but... I was always so careful around my girls. We hit a bump. There was a loud bang. I thought it was a tool box falling down in the back. I look across... I always check the chamber before I put. I was always so careful around my girls. And you, your big brown eyes, staring straight at her. I scrubbed you clean, held you all night. Praying I hadn't broken you. You know... Can't unscratch a broken record. Then Hugo turned up. Okay, so I was broken. No, no, no, no, no. Your eyes. Rose's eyes. I couldn't even look at you. He stepped up. We... We wouldn't have made it otherwise. God, I love you, brat, I love you. My little girl. It's okay, it's okay. Okay. I've gotta go make a phone call, okay? Okay. Okay. Hello? Guy, it's... I don't know what I was thinking. You can't stay, brat. Come to the city with me, we'll work something out. You won't be free if I'm there. But I love you. You don't know what's out there for you. No, I won't, I won't let you die for me. I won't, I can't. - I can't. - It's not your decision. I can't.
