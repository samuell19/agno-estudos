I wanna be free. Driving back in a western.. I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, with you. I wanna be free. Driving back in a western.. I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, with you. You're gonna do great. Dad, you ain't supposed to be back here. I couldn't let you go on stage without this. Aw, Dad, I can't wear that until I get in. It's bad luck. I hope you don't mind. What? This came today. What is this? No way. Shut the front door! I got accepted? Yes, baby girl. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh, OK. Can we afford this? Can we afford this? Don't you worry about that. Your future has always been my mission and nothing else. Dad, I promise you, when I get famous, I'm gonna pay you back. Baby girl, this is not about fame or fortune. It's about you. This is what that's about. Dad, Dad, you're getting blood on it. You're getting blood on it. You're getting blood on it. I'm not as coordinated as I used to be. Oh my gosh. I'm proud of you. You have a gift unlike anything I've ever had. Now, use it. Love you, Dad. Graduates, taking the stage to perform Whitney Houston's classic hit song... Let's go. "I'm Every Woman." You know, that's one of my my favorite songs. I was vacationing when it first came out in Cancun with my beautiful bride. And this music... overtook us in a way that... All right, all right, sir. Thank you, sir. I got that. Well, please welcome the captain of the glee club, the senior sing off state champion, your very own Vicky Waters! I'm every w... Call 911! Call 911 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. I believe the storm will soon be over. I believe... Vicky waters. The rain will go away. Vicky waters. Vicky Waters. You have a gift unlike anything I've ever had. Vicky Waters. Now, use it. Vicky Waters. Vicky Waters. Vicky, they called your name. Go on. Does your dad need copies of these? My dad's... oh, that's my uncle. He's a hunk. A hunk of what? Just take these down the hall to admissions, and you're done. Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! You're good. You're good. It's crazy. Thank you. Carry on. Thank you. It's crazy. Come in. Can I help you? So I see you got the memo. You got jokes? Yo, that was Sir the Baptist? Better known as the Bryan Moore. Yeah. He adjuncts here. Wow. So you mean I could actually be in a class taught by him? Mm, it depends on how good you are. The Bryan Moore? Yeah. He's teaching college kids? Well, you know he doesn't just teach. Mr. Moore completely transformed our school into an international music school where everybody wants to come, especially those of the female persuasion. You a student? Yeah, Cyrus. But everybody calls me Junior. OK, Vicky. I'm a sophomore. Yeah. I was sent down here by cougar. Everybody knows who you're talking about too. - Oh yeah. - Yeah. Like, is she the reason why it's so old school in here, with the forms and photos and everything? No, mm-mm. Is there an app? No. Chancellor Davis likes to keep things old school. Is part of the allure of Prestige. I mean, looking around, and you see everything here is state of the art. Yeah. Everything except for us laborers. Is that Jocko over there? Mm-hmm. Whoa. Slow down, OK? Those celebrities just come out to crown the winner. Is that the winner? Yeah. He's opening up for Major Life now. One Music Fest, and this is what happens. Hmm. This is not about fame. For sure. Gotta be in it to win it. Yeah. Um, you actually skipped a part on section 3. Cool. Um, hang tight. Mitch, I know, man. Geo? Huh? One of the celebrity judges for the sing off. Geo? Get out of here, yo. I'm looking at the paperwork right now. It's a chance to take this back. Fore! Wait, he showed you? Well, he asked me to make some copies, and I read them. All right, you shouldn't be telling people. People? You're my only friend, so don't worry. I think the secret is safe. Listen. For the last time, we were orientation partners, OK? That was the extent of our friendship. Now, stop yapping about Geo before you get in trouble. I'm his student liaison. I can't get in trouble. Oh my god, he's coming. Bye. Really? Bustling with activity. What a special place. Listen, Mitch. Do you know why you were selected for this position? Hard work? Determination? Because you follow the rules. So the next time I hear of you leaking information about the Music Fest, well, you'll be singing wee, wee, wee all the way home. Yes, sir. Sorry. I just got excited. You see, Prestige was built on a foundation of honor and character. Schools around the nation... Well, they have lowered their bars, sacrificing their standards. But not here. You see, for 200 years, our musical elite has passed the torch. And now it's my job to carry it, to protect it, and to pass it on to the next chancellor. So you see, there's no room for anything less than excellence. It was so nice to meet you. Very nice meeting you, and good luck. Thank you. Hey. Hey. You're back early. Yep. How was the tour of the campus? It was incredible. Sir the Baptist adjuncts there. Can you believe it? After two years at the JC, you were right. I'm ready. Uncle Blake's here. Oh my god. It's good to see you, Vicky. You too. What is going on here? We were just discussing needs for the house. Nothing's definite yet. Your Uncle Blake walked by the sign, said we could discuss a possibility of selling the house. Baby, I can't afford this house without your father being here. It's overwhelming. Vicky, baby, come on in here. Now, look. There's some things you don't need to worry about. We've got this. Blake, I've known you since you were Vicky's age. And the only time you show up around here is if I'm cooking a chicken or baking a bundt cake. Mm-hmm. And I ain't never seen you leave a cookie untouched, not even after Robert's funeral. So what's itching you? There's an issue with Robert's insurance. No, don't know tell me that, Black. You advised us to dip into the little bit that we have for Vicky's education until the insurance claim was processed. Yes, I know what I advised. But there was a wrinkle. A wrinkle? The claim was denied. - What? - What? Oh, lord. Blake. Wrinkle? Don't. That's an earthquake. Can they do that? Unfortunately, yes. It's a preventive death clause. Robert's clause was contingent on him getting a yearly physical, not a biannual. The adjuster, he checked his medical records and saw that he'd seen the doctor one day too late. Nah, nah, nah. You told me this was taken care of at the funeral. You told me everything was gonna be all right! I was wrong. Vicky. Look, the adjuster, he went through the files. He started Robert had went to the doctor, and his policy expired one day before the biannual physical. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Blake, I never thought you would come into this house with that kind of news. You think this is easy for me, Ken? Look, Robert was my brother too. OK, everybody. All right. We must appeal. Gwen can call and request an appeal packet. But you've got to be aware that this process isn't fast. OK, I get it. So that for sale sign... That was an idea in your head all along, huh? No, no. It is my job to take care of my brother's family. This is what you call taking care of, Blake? Family? I'd hate to see you the way you treat your enemies. This is so upsetting. Blake, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. We'll be in touch. Gwen. Blake. Out. You have every right to feel the way you do. I wanted to go there more than anywhere else in the world. I can't do that to Mom. My world is crashing down. And we might be moving. It's not over, baby girl. And no one is moving. Prestige is all that, Uncle Ken. Besides, you've seen the school. It wouldn't even put a dent in the tuition, and school start soon. There's no time. OK, look. You've already done two years. Why don't we just go ahead and finish what you started. Yeah, yeah. When's that, huh? Uncle, I don't want to be your age reminiscing on what could have been. And the only way for me to create that network is at Prestige. You know it, and I know it. Well, MJ didn't go to prestige. And despite what you said, despite your words being hurtful, I think it's true. The industry is different nowadays. Look at me, Unc. Women are changing the culture. And I must be where the culture changes itself. And that's Prestige. So it's about who you know? Exactly. This morning, I was on the path to be a star. But now, mm. Vicky, your dad always taught you that it's not about fame or any of that. It's about investing in your future. It's about doing what you love. Well, Unc, one, he's not here. And two, he left nothing. I mean, you heard Mom. You heard Grandma. Look at our house, Uncle Ken. Trying to keep up with the Joneses. Look, I understand your being angry. But your dad did leave us with something. Yeah. Nothing ever got him down. And he never let anything get in his way. Vicky, please remember that. Well, spirit don't pay no bills. And now you only see me in my victory. But when you feel... Here you go, baby. I brought you some tea. Go on and drink that. Thank you. The lord spoken for me. And I How are you doing, Gwen? Do you miss Robert? Well, of course I do. Then how come you never seem sad about losing them? Well, he wouldn't want us to be. Did you see the way Blake was looking at those flowers? You know, he thinks you're going crazy. At the moment, I don't care what Blake thinks. My daughter is lost, and so am I without Robert. I just can't... I just can't bring myself to clean him up because... Because of what? Because then he'd be really gone. Well, Gwen, he is gone. His body's gone, but his spirit, his spirit is still here. And if you clean up those flowers, you can move forward. How can you just turn it off? It's not about turning it off, Gwen. It's about turning it up. Turning it up to God, honey. Why when things go wrong do people always say go to church? Robert left us with a mess. I mean, look at all of these bills and everything. I mean, you more than anybody else should know that. Now, Gwen, Gwen, this might look like a mess to us. But to him, no, it's going in perfect order, exactly as planned. How do we explain this to Vicky? I know y'all hadn't been to church with me since Vicky was little. Now, come on, listen to me. Maybe it's time to dust off that Bible and let God reveal it to Vicky. Bring some balance back in his home. When her first puppy died she didn't come up from that basement for a week. Now that her plans for going to Prestige have evaporated, you think she gonna come rushing up them stairs to go to church? Oh, I'll get her up. How? Same way I used to get Robert out of bed as a kid to go to service. Oh, honey, grandma got this. He's my doctor in the sick room, he's my lawyer in the courtroom. He's the boss in the board room, the last thing I'm gonna let you do is keep him in church. Grandma, is that French toast I smell? Isn't this your favorite breakfast? Of course it's French toast. Come on in here. Yes, thank you, Grandma. Oh, you're welcome, baby. Now, eat up and get cleaned up, because we're going to church. Church? Grandma, I love your French toast, but I'm not going to church. Why not? Because I'm not in the mood. My life just got destroyed for a second time. I'm upset. That's good, because that's the perfect time to lean on God. Now, go on and eat up. I'll eat, but I'm not going to church. Girl, I just spent a whole hour pulling that breakfast together for you. I know you got an hour to accompany me to church, or else I'm gonna us this spoon to crack it over that little lazy behind of yours. Yes, ma'am. But you'll never get mom to come. Oh, really? It was your mama's idea. You better get your Sunday best on real quick, because we're going to church today and praise him. You so amazing, my God. You are so amazing, my God. You are so amazing. In order for us to genuinely be blessed by God, like Jacob, we've got to wrestle with God. Interesting, Jacob wrestles with the Lord and he wrestles all night and the day is about to break. OK. And as the day approaches, the angel says to Jacob, let me go. And Jacob says, I want you to bless me, so I'm not going to let go. Come on here, until you bless me. Now, the angel now does something and flips the script. He says to Jacob, all right, since you want a blessing, let me ask you a question. What is your name? Now, you've got to understand something, the last time somebody asked Jacob his name, he lied and he said he was somebody else. And so all the things that have happened to him from the point that he lied about his name to this point has happened under false pretenses. He's been living under somebody else's identity. But in order to get the breakthrough that you really need, you got to own who you really are. And so the angel said I can bless you, I will bless you. But before I do, you got to say your name. If we're going to get from God what God wants us to have, we've got to own who we really are. And so the angel says, what is your name? And he says wow, he has to go back to first base and he has to admit my name is Jacob, which means trickster, schemer, liar. But what I like about God is that once I acknowledge who I am, he changes my name. I just wonder has God ever changed anybody's name? I know you were a liar, but now you are true. I know you were darkness, but now you are light. You are not what they say you are. Baby, you ain't even what you say you are. You are what God says you are. I wish the church would say Amen. Amen. Amen! Put your hands together now and let's receive our youth pastor, Brother. What a word from our pastor. Because you give me joy, down deep in my soul, down deep in my soul, down deep in my soul. Yes, you give me joy down deep in my soul, down deep in my soul, down deep in my soul. My God, Nehemiah 8 and 6 "And Ezra blessed the Lord, thy God." And the people of God answered, Amen." Come on, make this your response to whatever it is. From the healing of your body, to the raising of the dead. No matter how you're feeling, or how your world is reeling, battle through the night, because you're going to win, you're going to win this fight. Amen, Amen, Amen. Admissions? I'm here to see Junior. In all my years working here, you're the first one's ever came this early. Look, I know probably about 8:00 it's going to be hundreds of students waiting out here for scheduling questions. I just need to see him for a minute. You're a student? I'm trying to be. Side door, building A. Thank you. If you get caught, wasn't me. Thank you so much, thank you. Hey, good luck. Yes, sir. You guys are flat. Hold it tight right there. Every head has to be tilted at 100 degree angle in order to maximize key. I believe you're at 95. Try it again. Oh, love. That's better, much better. Your body has to know this position. It has to come natural. Touch your throat, and you can feel it when you sing. I'm not doing that. That was disgusting. Remember our creed. True musicians do everything to support music, is that understood? I'm sorry. Now, touch your throats and try it again. Ahhhh. Yo, freshman, what are you doing in here? Junior, you scared me. Well, you can't be in here, all right. Neither can I. Come on. Listen, I need your help. With what? I need a scholarship. And I need a million bucks, OK. I just process the paperwork, Vicky. I don't actually do scholarships. Those are the trustees and Chancellor Davis. Four per year, they've already been given out, except for Music Fest. The Music Fest? Yeah. It's my only shot at getting in. What happened? I thought you were all in. Not anymore. Listen, you said it, the path to my music career leads right through Prestige. But Music Fest is only for fraternities. Well, you have to... I know, Mr. Moore's frats always win. But listen, I can beat them. I'm like Missy Elliott, only better. All right, listen, Vicky, you can't compete solo. All right, you have to be in a fraternity, and you're a girl, so it's not going to work. I'll start one. It can't be that hard. You're not even a Prestige student yet. You wouldn't know how to do that. Now come on, I've got to get some work. Wait, what if I'm in transition? It will never work, and you'll be trying to scam the system. Junior, that's why I need your help. I'm not going to be part of this. Now, let's go. V, we already talked about this. That's why I need your help. Can you meet me tonight after work? I have nothing to lose but to just try. But I do. Look, man, when my pops passed all of my options died with him, and I need this. You're not in my shoes. You're not. I worked my butt off to get here, and I won't put myself on Chancellor Davis' hit list. Look, you have no idea what you're up against. You can't beat the system. No frat, no entry, and I can't take that chance. Yeah, I guess it's always the system when you're on the outside looking in. But I need this, Junior. I'm sorry, V. I got to go. Admissions, this is Junior. Thanks. Have the final applications gone out? Yes, sir, this morning. Good. Good. Somewhere in that group is the next big star. What if the next big star is in this school? I beg your pardon? Like a person with natural talent, but no tuition money. I don't need your additional help, and we don't need any more broke students here. That's not how I built this. No, no, no, what I... Na, na, na, the only reason you are here is because you accepted the job to pay off your debt. I just meant what if we missed out on the chance to bring in a true star. We... we... we? This school is a system, it has and will continue to be. Now, the alum, they pay me good money to keep the system in place. Anything that goes against the grain, I squash them. Nobody but Jesus. If your feet start slipping... Who is it this time of night? Hey. Hey, is Vicky here? Then you have to arrange a meeting with GLO to declare your intent to start that chapter. Wait, hold on, fraternities are for men and sororities are for women. Yeah. My plan, you're in transition, right? Let's go along with that. Go along with what? I'm in transition. Yeah. My mama will kill me, Junior. Isn't there a process for people that are in transition? No, thought about this, too. You're going to go to your closet and dress down, like all the way down. And through this process, you'll start to feel and act more like a tomboy, just until Music Fest, OK? GLO is Greek Life Obviously, right? Correct. And there's one on campus. Then you'll have to draft up a Constitution and bylaws for your sor... Fraternity, in this case. And well, just get a vote to pass them. Can't we just move forward? I just want to perform and sing. If it was that easy then everybody would be doing it. OK, look, I came here with a plan, sort of. OK, all right, I'm in transition. Great. Wait, hold on, let me hear you sing something before we go any further. Hmm, OK. People dying, people killing, people riding, people stealing. And I don't know what it is, something's got to change. OK, OK. That just might work. Well, all right, if it's that easy then, you know, I can. And if I'm the only one in it I can win Music - Fest. - Mm-hmm. Get a scholarship. Mm-hmm. Then become famous. It sounds like you've got it all mapped out, freshman. You don't need my help. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, come on, where are you going? Chancellor Davis was right. People just trying to turn the system. Don't do that. Come on, Junior. OK, first of all, I came here not to make you famous, but to help you win that scholarship. OK? OK. And I forgot the Music Fest is male driven, but I mean, things in motion just stay in motion. Who said women can't win anyway? Who made those stupid rules up? Chancellor Davis. I've never been on the front line of war. Look, I've got to do this, Junior. So many women are counting on the rules to be changed. So transitioning it is. I won't say a word to anyone. I never hung a missile, high in the sky. I need to figure out what I'm gonna write for my speech. What? I'm just playing. Better be. Running for their lives. Why... why did you do this for me? What? I mean, I never would have found any of this information and all. Like, why are you helping me? Davis. I mean, he's just such a... you know, I just want to see him squirm. What? You're helping me because of Davis? Mm-hmm. See, you're no dear friend. These bylaws and rules, they are for men. No, it's not. Not women. It's more than that, OK. Chancellor Davis will never allow anyone to do anything unless it's under his terms. There's no wiggle room. Besides, I saw your file. You don't have a lot of time, and I want to see you stick it to Chancellor Davis and his system, shoot. Yeah? Yeah. Honestly, I thought you were part of his system too, but I guess I was wrong. Yeah. - You like me, don't you? - What? No, I like working in the... Yeah, right. No, I work... OK, look, I work in the admissions office in order to make, you know, tuition and continue going to this school. Look, it's like you said, OK, Prestige is a world renowned school, you know. I do wish I could stick it to him the way you do, though. But look, there's not a lot of time, OK, and you're going to need all the help in short fashion that you can get. Now, go forth and start your one man woman fraternity. Get yourself into Prestige, girl. A one man fraternity. Hey, hey. There is no such thing. This is my Uncle Ken. Hello, sir. It's good to meet you. All right. How much did you hear? Every last word, especially that one man fraternity business. Oh, here we go. Not another story. Now, according to your documents there, a fraternity is defined by a group of individuals coming together to share a common interest. Well, a fraternity is way more than that. A fraternity is a... It's a brotherhood. It's a network of boys coming together to become men. He's right. You need at least two people to start a fraternity. It says it right here, and one of them have to be a current student. So can you and I do it together? Vicky, you are not listening. Brotherhood. Women join sororities. Frats are for the bros. He's right. I can't join a fraternity. But Junior is the only current student I know. So OK, so you mean I have to find a guy on campus with no friends of his own and willing to start a frat with a total stranger? I mean, is there really anybody at Prestige that pathetic? I might just have somebody pathetic in mind. OK, so you're actually going to go through with this wacked idea? Yeah, Unc. I mean, come on, you cannot tell my mother about this unless you got some money buried in the backyard somewhere. I don't know nothing, I didn't hear nothing. And when the ship comes crashing in, you keep my name out of your mouth. Hey, I got you, OK. You won't have to worry about me, Unc. Crossing guard? He's a student and a great singer. He's a student liaison, which basically makes him Chancellor Davis' personal caddy. Then why is he wearing a reflective vest? Well... And stopping cars. Yeah. Because of his association with Chancellor Davis, everybody calls him Mitch the Snitch. Mitch the Snitch! Mitch the Snitch! So he volunteers for all this extra stuff to make friends. It's not working. It's crazy. Yeah. I posted messages all over social media for Prestige students, you know, letting them know I'm starting a new frat. Got no takers. Think he'll go for this? Without a doubt. He'd climb into a tree if he thought the girls would like him. Whatever it takes. All right, so just stick to the plan. So, Mitch, did you get the message? What do you think? Yeah, sure, I'm in. Yeah? Yeah. Do I sign these or? Just the registration form. We'll turn it in at the GLO office. Cool beans. I'm finally going to be in a frat. When do we get matching tattoos? All right, do you have any real questions, Mitch? I don't think so. This is going to look good on my resume once it's time for Chancellor Davis to pin somebody. Oh my gosh, dude, will you drop that? That whole pin thing is an urban legend, OK. Uh-uh, it's real. What pin? OK, rumor has it that Chancellor Davis has this solid gold pin that he uses to name the next student headmaster. This is like being named student council president. It gives you authority over the entire student body. It's real, and someday it's going to be mine. Oh, I'd do anything to get that pin. Sure, the only thing is nobody's ever seen it. The last time he allegedly named a student headmaster was, like, eight years ago. But the geeks believe in it like it's the Loch Ness Monster or something. FYI the Loch Ness Monster is real. Point proven. Look, Mitch, is there anything else that you need to know about Old Vick here? I know the basics. Graduated of Glen Valley, honor roll, lives on prospects, single family home, plays piano and string instruments, but specializes in singing. Lost her dad, being raised by your mother, uncle, and grandmother. The system has Vicky as Victoria. I'm in transition. I know you're in transition. Wait, was it something I said? Bro, I'm trying to figure out how are you... How did you know all that? Yeah, Mitch, how did you know all of that? I read everything. And when Junior said I'd be meeting you, I looked at your file when I was making copies. He asked for your app and transcript a few days ago. Oh gosh. Really? Did you just say what I just think you just said? So the chancellor is interested in me? Oh, I'm so in. Stop smiling. That's not a good thing. If he's seen your file, and he... Knows you're in transition, he will deaden this before we start. Exactly. Being on Chancellor Davis's radar is like having a drone above your head. At any moment, a boom, a precise missile strike can happen. Listen, Mitch, you need to make those files disappear, man. Wait, what did I do to get on his hit list? That's the thing, nobody ever knows. But if Chancellor Davis feels like you're not Prestige material then he starts to coordinate his MO and for a full annihilation. It's not uncommon for him to check for the files of incoming freshmen. He likes to keep his fingers on the pulse of the student body, considers it shaping the Prestige mold. Yeah, the same way the Terminator has full knowledge of the human body in order to make him a more effective killing machine. Did you know that Junior's major is musical theater? All right, man. He's an actual drama queen. OK, dude, calm down. Tried and true in the flesh. Don't listen to him, all right, he's crazy. Don't let him scare you. Listen, I don't know who to believe, but I have nothing to lose. So Mitch, if you're in, let's do it. Let's do it, brother. You might want to get these nails cleaned up. Mitch, just have that file back to us, OK? I'm so worth it. I have been waiting for you. Name? Dang, you tall. Are you trying to be on a basketball team or something, be my center? Name? Don't have one. Alpha Chiro. Yeah, they don't exist on campus, right? That's correct. Good, good, good, good, Kevin, stand taller. Joe, project without screaming, all right. From the diaphragm, here, let's try it again. I'll make love to you, like you want me to. Excellent, excellent. You guys sound great. Listen, I hope you're ready, because you're going to be closing out the Music Fest this season with a big finale. Be sure not to disappoint. OK, let's try it again. I'll make love to you, like you want me to. These guys are ready. Let me talk to you for a second. Yeah, Brian? I want my students to perform without interruptions, which means I need you to give them time to perform. Is that understood? Yeah, understood. Music stops and starts here with me. Give me time to work with them. Don't interrupt. Got you. Let's take it again. I'll make love to you. You know, Mitch, when they build a skyscraper the first thing they do is pour the footing. That's just like a mound of concrete that the whole building rests upon. Where is my tee? Sir, sorry, but we ran out. Well, you know what that means. Sir? Well, that'll teach you once again to have my golf bag stocked. I found out some interesting information from a Greek life office. Seems that there's been a motion to create a new fraternity on our campus. I want the names of everyone on that list. Why? Because there hasn't been a new frat here since 1980s. There's turbulence in the water. I can sense it. Here, I want you to look at this security camera footage. Security camera? I didn't know we had security cameras. Oh, there's cameras everywhere. I just want people to believe that we're more traditional than technological. Meh, his name is Vick. He's responsible for the new frat. How do you know? Because he tagged Prestige in all the the social media the other day. He's trying to recruit students for the fraternity. That kid is public enemy number one in my eyes. Now, look, you are my eyes and my ears, and you dropped the ball on this one. Now, listen, Mitch, now I know you had a tough time in high school, and you're still having a tough time now. But let me... let me tell you a little secret, so did I when I was younger. I know it's hard to believe I was a bit of a nerd, but I was. And it's kids like Vick who made my life miserable. You mean, Black kids? No, you idiot. The cool kids will never get over on me again, nor you. I am here to protect the system or it'll go to trash. Now listen, I need the names of all those students. Take them to the Greek life office first thing Monday morning. There's going to be a change in the GLO policy. And you know what I realized? Life is, it's all about the balance. It's all about the push and the pull. It's, like, like, light to a bulb, like water to a faucet, like an itch to a scratch. Life is really like a pancake. Sometimes you just got to flip it up and drop it on down. And that, that is life. Bow stage left, bow stage right, center, good night. What are you doing here? What'd you think? Amazing. Yeah? Absolutely amazing. What could you possibly need me for? Well, I can submit it now for a grade, or I can wait until you're here and then we can work on improving it together. Together? Together. You need three people to start a fraternity now. How did it change? Chancellor Davis said it was something that GLO office wanted to do because some frat in the '80s was started and it didn't work out well. That's garbage. I never heard about that in admissions. He just changed it himself. But why? That's how he is, I knew this. We can't get another guy to join us. Besides, finding someone who isn't already in a frat is near impossible anyway. If Chancellor Davis keep changing the rules we have no hope, none. Wait, it's just three people. It says it right here, in order to get this out fast and quick he didn't change any of the words, he just changed the number. So if we can just find one more person in this whole world, then boom, we're back on track. But who? It's not a matter of fact of just throwing bodies up there. We are competing against some of the best musical talent in the world. We need someone who can sing, someone with a voice that pulls the emotion from the listener. Singers that are going to make you want to jump out of your seat and throw your hands in the air. But, what are you looking at? I know that look. She's got a plan brewing up in there. Divine intervention. I'll praise, I'll praise our God. Yeah, I'll praise, his honor, and all will see our praise. Praise. The more he do it, I love it. He did it today. All the time. Hey! Wasn't that a wonderful service? Of course it was. Great time. Yeah, we'll see you all next Sunday. See you next Sunday. All right. God bless you. Have a blessed week. You know something, I have never in my life seen Vicky more excited to go to church than she was this morning. Shoot, I didn't even have to break out my waffle batter. What's itching you? Ever since she started spending time with Junior I've noticed a change. You know, start dressing differently. It's like her whole attitude has done an about face. Something's definitely up, but as long as she's going to church, she's happy, what more could a mama want? Well, ain't that the truth? Mm-hmm, amen. Amen. It's turning around for me. Oh, I didn't know I had an audience. Hey, guys. What's up. So did you get a message? Partying and drinking aren't really my thing. No, no, no, no, it's a music group. We'll be performing and singing songs. The only reason we were called a fraternity is so that we can be eligible to enter Music Fest. Sounds a little underhanded. You're not a guy, and you definitely don't look the part. No, it's not. It's totally on the level. Listen, Vick, I bring people to Christ through song. That's my focus. I wish you all the best, but we're on two different journeys. Truth be told, I'm in transition. OK, that's a good start. Turning a new leaf for God. Good luck. What if I told you I could introduce you to Brian Moore? Brian Moore? Yeah. How? Well, he teaches at Prestige, and he's the host of Music Fest. I mean, who knows, maybe he's looking to put out some Faith based singles. I mean, just imagine the exposure for the church. And the only way into this competition is by being in a fraternity? Yes, sir. Do I look like I have time for school with all my responsibilities here at the church? Just think of it more as a band than a frat, you know. Pastor, talk about the pastor. I'm sure... I'm sure your pastor would love for his youth pastor to have more education. Education, yeah. Should we win. If I sense anything underhanded, I'm out. I'm only doing this to make music to save souls. Deal? Deal. You're not going to regret it. Hey, Vicky, where are you going? Huh? Huh? You got the youth pastor from the church and other kids from Prestige downstairs. What are you trying to rope them into? Dad's insurance money is gone, so I'm gonna solve the problem myself. Well, do me a favor, while you're trying to solve your problems, make sure you're not creating problems for others. Yeah, you too. Ouch. You know what. Gwen, look, she's just trying to find her way. Let her be, just let her be. This is the hard part about being a mother, but I'm gonna fallback as they say, right? Fall back. That's a cool mustache you have. It's a nice pair of skinny jeans. Thanks, but they're not actually skinny jeans. They're just too tight on me. I gained the freshman five last year, and oddly enough, a lot of it went to my legs. OK, we're all set up. What are you doing? Mr. Moore says to tape all rehearsals so you can not only play it back to listen with a fresh ear, but to see your body mechanics while singing. He's right. So what are we singing? Got something for you. Makes me high, one for the money, two for the ride, three for put me into the sunshine. Dope, old school. Comes in my back, so tuck that ass take her from the back. MLB from the cradle to the grave. What is this? Music makes me high? Yeah, what's the problem? It's secular. I thought this was a Christian thing. No, no, no, no, no, we're singing pop music. I'm talking about the kind of stuff that sells worldwide and gains attention. I see. I'm out of here. Wait, where are you going? Come on. Come on, man. Come on, bro, don't do this. Yo, Ty, just give it a try, man. What's the big deal? Bro, come on. I've been given a gift, and I want to use it properly. I'm sorry you guys don't understand that, but the only reason I came down here is because I thought you were preparing to sing songs of empowerment, not evil thinking songs. Understand something, Ty. We can't take the competition on the stage... Listen, listen, no, no, no just go with gospel, OK. Just go with gospel. OK, OK, all right, Ty, gospel song it is. What? Chill. Really? Why the change of heart? I mean, you're right. What better opportunity to get God's message to a group of college kids? So let's do it. Yeah. When I die, hallelujah by and by, oh fly away. Beautiful, beautiful, guys. That was great. Vicky, just head up, looking out here. Mitch, just stay in pitch with Ty, OK? Do whatever he does, simple. All right, guys, look at the time. I got to go. Same time tomorrow? Yes. Me too. Look, you did great, OK. Thank you. See you tomorrow. OK, see you. Not bad for our first crack at it, huh? Are you insane? We sounded like a Sunday school choir up there. We have no chance of winning this. This competition is about the real world. Nobody ever performs Faith based music. Which is exactly why we're going to do it. Listen, to get noticed, we have to do something different. We have to stand out from the crowd. Chancellor Davis is going to flip his underwear inside out when he gets wind of this. Which is exactly why we're not going to tell him until we take the stage. It's going to work, Mitch. Gospel music, it's stupid. Bro, between me and you, I don't buy it neither. God didn't stop my dad from dying and he ain't paying for Prestige for me. Look, Ty's a youth pastor and Junior, he seems to be buying it. So I have to play up the Christian angle to keep them both on board. In reality, it's all nonsense. But for the people who buy this Christian stuff, this music gets them so motivated. Man, you got to think about it, the controversy surrounding a song selection like this will guarantee the whole campus will know who I am and what I've come to do. Listen, Mitch, when this is over, we're going to be stars. And if Davis tries anything after this, it's only going to make us bigger stars. OK? OK. Come on. Between me and you, I don't buy it either. God didn't stop my dad from dying and he ain't paying for Prestige for me. Look, Ty's a youth pastor, and Junior, he seems to be buying it. So we have to put up the Christian angle to keep them both on board. In reality, it's all nonsense. But for the people who buy this Christmas stuff. Thank you very much, sir. There is something terrible in my golf cart. I... I was just I... Take a look, Mitch. Look, look closer. What is it? Mouse droppings. So all of a sudden we have rodent problems in our garage. The thought of a rodent sneaking around this place when no one's looking makes me want to cringe. I want it killed as fast as possible. Then we can go back to normal, like nothing ever happened. Because if there's one thing I hate, it's a rodent in my presence. Mmm-mm. Is uncle Ken working late? No, he'll be here. Pull up a chair for him. Hello, mother. It looks great. So mom, if I sit him right here, Uncle Ken gonna talk his head off. But if I sit him over there, then I'll be too far away. So I thought about just flipping or switching grandma, or bumping her down. But then if she has to go to the kitchen he'll have to squeeze by you. So I thought about flipping Uncle Ken and grandma. Hmm. But then if he needs more sauce, it'll be close. But then he can't reach the knees. See. There's actually an easy solution. What is it? Why don't you sit in dad's seat? Me? Yes, you, Vicky. I guess so. Ta-da! Come here. Easy, mom, easy. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm OK. Grandma Ro used to tell me that your father, the first time I came over for dinner, he was a nervous wreck. He set and then reset the table for like an hour. He wanted everything to be perfect. He was nervous just like you. I'm not nervous. I just want everything to be... Perfect. Yeah. Perfect. Truth is, I didn't even notice the table. When the connection is there, nothing else matters but the way they smile when they see you, the way their brows moves when they let you know they interesting, the way they take in a breath just before they laugh. When you find that person, Vicky, that plate ain't gonna even matter. Ain't that right? Amen, amen. OK, here we go, last but not least. Oh, look at that. Some ziti. Oh, that looks good. Hey, brother, let's dig in. This is already so good. Thank you so much. Oh, you know, it needs a little pepper. Here, take some. Ken! You better not throw no pepper at nobody. Come on, that's not how we treat company. All right, I'm not gonna throw it, come on now. I can look at Junior and tell he's a man that knows about things being thrown around the table. Am I right, Junior? Yes, sir, I have four sisters, so there's not much I haven't seen thrown around the room, sir. You know, I used to date a girl who had four older sisters. Yeah? Longest two days of my life. Well, Uncle Ken, Junior's not like your typical Prestige crowd. He's actually normal. Oh, I beg to differ, Vicky. If he was normal he wouldn't be sitting here at this table with this family. Oh, stop it. Uncle Ken. And look, Junior, don't you let Ken scare you, you hear? You know those old inflatable guys that go up and down in the used car lots? Yes. Well, he is our version of that in our family. I'm retired though. Well, that's good to know. So, is Prestige as amazing as what Vicky tells us? Probably more so, which is why I'm sure she has a chance to win that scholarship. And Sir The Baptist, they brought him into... Uh, baby? Hmm? Who's Sir the Baptist? Oh, Chancellor Davis brought him in to revamp the music program. Yeah, him and Chancellor Davis butt heads from time to time, but it's all good though. Thank you for everything you've done. Of course, it's my pleasure. I mean, she belongs there. The teacher of one of my performing elective classes, they said pop stars are built off of training, God given talent, and it factor. Oh. I don't know about that, but Vicky definitely has it. I can tell from the first moment I met her. And all of you know that she's got the god given talent, so just with a little more training, there won't be no stopping her. Your family lives in? Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania, oh. Yeah. Whoa, that's kind of far away. So you know what, you think of us as your second family? That's right. Thank you, Mrs. Waters. You're welcome, anything you need. You know, there is one thing. What's that? You all going to church tomorrow? You bet we are. You think I could come? Of course, you don't even have to ask, sweetheart. That's right, nobody needs to RSVP to the Lord. Amen. Amen. Junior, you sure you want to do that? Yeah, I do. I mean, unless that's a problem. Mm-mm. None, none whatsoever. Nice. Well, it's just the songs that you, Ty, and Mitch have been rehearsing are really inspirational, you know. I figured I'd check them out if I could. But it's not just going to be a song service. It's going to be another hour of sermon. That's fine. I want the full experience. Well, good, because our reverend preach. Yeah? Amen. I'm gonna check him out then. Folks don't usually decide when to go to church, life decides it for them. What do you mean? Well, sometimes honey, people have to hit bottom before they realize how important God is to them. But I tell you this, when they take God into their lives, it's the best decision they can ever make. Can't nobody do me like you, Jesus. Can't nobody do me like you, Jesus. Can't nobody do me like the Lord. Can't nobody do me like you, Jesus. And I give you glory, I give you glory, yeah. Hey, I give you glory, I give you glory, yeah. I give you glory, I give you glory. I give you glory, I give you glory. I give you glory, I give you glory. Can't nobody do me like the Lord, yeah. Can't nobody do me like you, Jesus. I give you glory, I give you glory, yeah. Hey hey, I give you glory, I give you glory. I give you glory, I give you glory. You get the glory, you get the glory. I give you glory, I give you glory, yeah. You get the glory, you get the glory. I give you glory. I give you glory. It's already mine, it's already mine. Hey, hey, hey. Gwen, this is Mr. Richard. Reynolds he's the head of our appeals department. Nice to meet you. Mrs. Waters, well, I'd like you to know that our appeals department, we have done a careful analysis of your case, and I want you to understand that we've given significantly more time to your claim than our others. And our reps, they put in over 60 hours to ensure that we were in line with your husband's insurance agreement. Thank you for the meeting. Can I call you Richard? Most definitely. Are you married? Happily married. Excuse me for being Frank, but Richard, hours don't bring my husband back. My life has been turned upside down since his death, and your insurance denial has handcuffed my family. You have to understand that my husband Robert was my... He was my best friend, my lover, and my provider, and he's gone. And just like that, just like that, I knew me coming here, nothing would get done. Nothing would get done, because all you big insurance company do is let the little man know that he means nothing. Do you understand? Stop, Blake, sit down, Blake. I'm trying to figure this all out. All right. Richard is on our... Richard is what? Mrs. Waters, on a personal note, I have two small children as well, and our company only wants the best for our clients. And sometimes there's a lapse, sometimes it happens. But I just want you to know, we're here to help. No, my prayers aren't yours. We come from the blood, where we dodge cars, and pray through open doors. Tell me if there's a room for Jesus in the ghetto. Tell me if there's room for Jesus in the ghetto. Tell me if there's room. I need to know if there's a place for me somewhere in the ghetto. Grandma, I don't think she heard me, guys. Oh no? Yeah, I'll be right back. Got it? All right. Then we got through it all, didn't we? I tell you what, he is so good to us. All the time. All the time. Hey. What happened? Nothing sweetheart, just the same old, same old. I'm so sorry. Oh, don't be, sweetheart. I was feeling like a truck hit me, so I went out and I got me some air. And when I came back, I was climbing those steps and I could hear you and your friends glorifying God's name. And you know what that made me realize? We're going to be OK. You got to understand, this was all God's plan. Yeah, we may have lost your father. We may have lost income. We may have lost opportunities. But look what we've gained, look what you gained. So I want you to keep on singing, you hear me? Amen. You keep on singing. Every day. - Yes. - When I wake up. Come on, now. OK. Come on. I can see mercy's all around me. And then the circles fade. I'm changing the rules to Music Fest. Why? Singing gospel music will not happen on my watch. Listen, I have a salary. I have medical benefits. I have all the free golf I can handle. This is big business. I don't have any room for church. And all it would take is one kid to complain and this whole thing could ignite like a California wildfire. Music Fest is supposed to be for all music. Yes, in a perfect world. But in the real world, Music Fest is a cash cow, bringing in mountains of funding and keeping me on top of the world. And I am going to ride it until the wheels fall off. Well, what about Mitch? When he's not cleaning the golf cart or making the copies, he is a good student. Let me put it this way, do you enjoy this course? Yes. Yes, yes, well, if there's controversy the sponsors will distance themselves. And it is the sponsors who helped fund these big perks, such as this place and the golf course and new buildings. Safe and steady is what we want. And I am not going to allow anyone to adjust my lifestyle, including anyone singing gospel music. However, that is not advancement for education. Vick Waters is not even a student here. No scholarship, no entry. Now, Mr. Moore, your job here is to teach music. Mine is to run this school. And I tell you right now, I am not allowing those students to step on stage and sing religious music, that I guarantee. Got it. What's up, champ? What's up? You nervous? My whole life rides on Music Fest. I have to win. Don't put that much weight on yourself. But it's true. This, my dad gave it to little before dying. This right here, it's all I have left of him. Vicky, you're wrong. You have a totally complete family. This speck of blood is not your father. His values are around you and your whole family. As long as you're looking at something that small, you're never gonna see it. Yeah, I'm willing to sell my soul to win. I don't think my dad would be too proud of me. Listen to me, my parents... My parents divorced this summer. They're atheists. My sisters said that they're never going to get married and never have kids. They're all so selfish, so distant from each other. A family like yours, that's what I've always wanted. Look, hold this up, OK? This little dot, is eclipsing the sunlight in your life. Don't let it, OK? Your father wouldn't want you to, I don't either. OK, the wisdom of an older man. Oh, so, now you got jokes, huh? Little bit, little bit. Listen, regardless of what happens, you always got me. Ow! What is taking you so long to set these traps? How many have you set? Including these? Two. Well, listen, Mitch, I have some bad news for you. Tomorrow you are going to be expelled. What? Why? I found out about your little song selection. And being that you are the only Prestige student that is a part of Alpha Chiro, well, you're the only one I have authority to preside disciplinary action over. It's just a song, sir. No, unfortunately it's not. You see, the trustees are not going to like it, and they're going to want someone to be made accountable for it. And unfortunately, that's going to be you. But I might be able to help, I don't know. How? Well, what if I told you that I could prevent you from being expelled? Could you? And get a full scholarship? Could you? Ah, a secret full scholarship. Could you? Of course I can, Mitch. You know, when they told me what was going to happen to you tomorrow I thought to myself, oh my goodness, I can't let my best student liaison get tossed out like garbage. In fact, there's this. Oh, is that? Yes, the student headmaster pin. You just about earned it. It is real. Thank you. Oh, put me down. I... I just need you to do one more thing for me. Oh? OK, anything. Now, listen, I'm asking for everyone's prayers tonight for Vicky and Ty as they perform God's music at the Music Fest, the Prestige. They're going to be singing in front of their peers, and tonight Lord, we pray that you give them the strength and the determination they need, Lord, to sing to your expectations and not to man's. Amen, amen. And the people said Amen. Hallelujah. Come on, Vicky. I would like to thank all of you for the prayers and the support as I go Prestige to bear God's message. Ty is a youth pastor and Junior seems to be buying it, so I have to play up the Christian angle to keep them on board. But people that buy Christian stuff, this music gets them... Junior! Junior? Junior! Junior! Junior! Vicky, Vicky. Did you know about this? I didn't know anything. Let her go. She's got my car. Junior! Junior! Mitch, come here, come here. Smile, Mitch, smile. Listen, if everything went as planned, you my friend are going to have a very bright future here. He didn't even go to school here. Forget about him. Oh, come on, it's time. Junior, I really didn't mean it. Oh, so that was your twin on the tape. Look, don't stand here and tell me you didn't mean it. Don't be a manipulator and a liar. OK, I did mean it. But remember, you the one that came up with the transition thing. Oh, so now you want to deflate your responsibilities and cover up what you said. Please, V. You see, at first it was all about standing out at Music Fest. But the more we rehearsed, I saw the effect the lyrics had on you, my family, the congregation. It started to make sense. You were cute when I first met you, you were irresistible, in awe, like even when it seemed like you believed in something bigger than yourself. Please, don't do this to me too. You know what I learned my first day at Prestige? Believe in yourself. I've lost her. Oh, no. She's empty inside. No, Gwen, I think it's just the opposite. I think she's finding herself. She's got so many feelings inside she doesn't know which one to choose. I just don't understand what she was trying to do. If Robert was here, he'd know what to do. I raised Robert. I knew exactly what he would do. He would say the only way to get through this mess is right through the heart of it. Vicky needs to hear that. Oh, baby, Vicky already knows. Challenge, try not to move. I can't help myself. This your song, but try not to move. I can't help myself. Mitch, you got to be here somewhere. I can't believe this man ratted me out like that, bro. Damn. You heard the rhythms, I know that you feel this. So get this, so hit your DJ and tell him to spin this. Got your jam try not to move. It's your song, but try not to groove. Do your dance, but there's no moves. Help out the girl like oo, hope to get the girl like ah. I can't help myself. God is good. You know, Ty, you're supposed to channel that energy during the service. That kid used me. She used all of us. Is that it? That's it. As a youth pastor, you're supposed to learn something new every day. I wonder, what have you learned today? Because of the giving nature of what we do, people will always take advantage. Well, that's the risk we take some time. At least I know how to spot a phony. You know, Ty, it's easier to lead people who are already walking in the right direction. Mitch! Mitch, I know you in here somewhere. Mitch, where are you hiding? I should have know when Junior told me you was a snitch you'd stoop this low. OK, OK, don't hit me. Mitch, are you serious? Why did you do it? For a pin? It's all I wanted since I got here. Bro, we had already accepted you. That's the only reason why you wanted it. - You were using me. - Mitch. I was never too stupid to know that. At the beginning, I kind of was. But somewhere along the way, I thought we became friends, like real friends. Real? Yes, for real. You mean that? I mean that. I'm sorry Vicky, but I'm a student at Prestige and I don't want to lose that. I'm all alone here. No family, no friends, just me. What's this? You'll need it to perform. Look. What's this? OK, so you made up for it? Yeah. That's dope, Mitch, OK. Yeah. Listen, where's Ty? I left him a message, but he never responded. OK, OK, OK. We're going to meet back here. I'm gonna go put this on. And now, for my pride and joy, Alpha Beta Sigma, whoop! I don't quite like where I am. There has to be a place where I can go and no one knows my name, and I can spend some time alone with you and only you is what I need. Because I feel free enough to say these things that while you are my sanity. Up inside the towers of my mind, you live sublime, and no one but me knows that you exist. It's not really easy for me to hide a light so bright, and there's only one way to describe you. Hey, let me grab my bag real quick and we'll get out of here. OK. Mitch. Wait, shh, shh. Mitch. Go, go. Mitch, Mitch, I know that Water's kid is hiding in here. Chancellor Davis saw her go in. I just need to remove her, that's all. You, go behind me, go, go, go, go, go. This can be done real easy, man. There's only one way in and one way out. Go, Vicky, go, go. Vicky, use that Music Fest go. Get back here Waters. And that concludes our final music act. Oh, good heavens. Security. Women should be able to sing. Get this kid off the stage, and off this campus immediately. Let me sing. Women should be able to sing in this competition. Give me a chance. I hope you had fun. The judges will now tally the... Let her sing! Let her sing! Let her sing! Let her sing! Let her sing! Let her sing! Let her sing! Let her sing! Let her sing! Ladies and gentlemen, the last act of the evening, Alpha Chiro. Your teaching days are over. Mr. Moore, true musicians support your music. When I first chose this song, I didn't give the message much thought. But I get it now. There's something else I would like to say. When I learned that the school was only allowing men to compete, I decided to cheat, say I was in transition, one of the boys. It wasn't right, nor was it fair. But I strongly believe every person, man or woman, should be able to perform. Laws are meant to be changed. Wait, wait, wait, listen, um, I did everything in my power to stop her from being on stage and singing the song. And I was against this from the beginning, and consequences will be had, I assure you. I had nothing to do with this, and I'm very sorry. She or he changed the rules. You were going to stop this? Well, but... Mandatory board meeting tomorrow morning, the bylaws will be changed. The board of trustees would like to know more about the details of your efforts. Don't, don't... After losing someone that meant everything to me, I was truly lost. Thanks to some really special people that helped guide me back to being my true self. I believe that it's my season. It didn't hurt that I was able to stay on, despite my hand in trying to stick it to Chancellor Davis. I've never been so grateful for the people that I've met that challenged me, even the possible future in-laws. It's my time, and I can feel it. Mom finally listened to grandma. Fighting for the insurance money gave her the spirit to move on, but she'll always miss my dad. Even though I wasn't able to perform, they did give me a partial scholarship for bringing awareness of outdated rules that needed to be changed. The board even brought us a new chancellor. All of us women looking to change the narrative have to keep pushing and not let up. And it's gonna be big. God will always be the guiding light through all of us. And it s gonna be big. God's gonna open the windows of heaven, pour me out a blessing, won't be wrong to contain it, won't even trying to explain it. But it's gonna be big. Riding shotgun when I'm turbo, buddy make whole world know. Why are you trying to make Stephen Erkle, you can't stay still you got to work though. All around the world like Where's Waldo, in the club but he ain't on the wall though, he's in the hood asking where the child goes. I know you only see me in my victory. But when defeat took the words from me, the Lord spoke out for me. And I made it through, yes, me too. If it ever came down to just me and God, it's OK. OK. Yo, you good? I'm all good. You don't sound like it, your mom told me to call you. I'm just checking on you. Oh, I know you're going through some stuff, but it's going to be all right, shorty, you know. Hey, keep your head up, you know. Ooh, I'm gonna be OK. And no one but me knows that you exist. It's not very easy for me to hide a light so bright, and there's only one word to describe you. Special, special, ooh, special you are. No, my prayers aren't yours. We come from the block where we dodge cars and pray through open doors. Tell me if there's room for Jesus in the ghetto. Tell me if there's room for Jesus in the ghetto. Tell me if there's room in the ghetto, tell me if there's room in the ghetto. Run for their lives, but the battle I fought, I fought it well, I stood tall. And one day, well, you're going to have to fight well. You ought to stand tall. Sing it with me, y'all. I'm a gangster, ain't no way that you can take my energy. Haters trying to trap me but I'm flying free. Now I'm flossing in front of my enemy.
