Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness. This hurts, this hurts, this hurts! This hurts, this hurts, this hurts! I knew I should have listened to the doctor when he said don't lift anything heavy. Ow, man. Ow. Paul! Ow. Paul! Paul? Paul? Where are you? I need you! I need help! Are you dying? I think so. Yeah, It sounds like you're dying. This is gonna be cold, so don't yell. It's okay. I'm a tough guy. I can take it. Tough guy huh? That's right. Ohhh! Shit, okay! Cold! Cold! Shhhh. Tough guy, huh? I can't believe this happened. Of all weekends. The weekend I have this special guest coming up. Well, because it was your idea to fix the fence rather than hire a professional. You know, your parents have the money for that kind of thing. It's like a tradeoff, you know with my dad. He lets me come up here, and do pretty much whatever I want to do. And I just have to do a few things around the house. You know, like stuff you won't do. Like fix the fence. This is why I like your dad. He's very fair. I'm sure I'll be fine in a day or so. So, who's the guy you're bringing up for the weekend? You've met him. The movies the other day, remember? You know when you showed up at the movies. You met him. His name's Danny? Oh, that guy? Uh huh. Danny Boy! Danny, Danny, Danny. He's so nice, and friendly. Really? That guy? Yeah. Well, ain't that sweet. The two of you dating. Yeah, ain’t it sweet? What did he say when you asked him to come up here for the weekend? Well, he, thought about it, carefully. And then he said yes. You do realize that he probably thinks you're inviting him up here to take advantage of him. Yeah, so what's your point? You're such a player. Who can resist my undeniable charm? I can think of one, maybe two people. Haha. Well, I've got it all planned out. We're going to have a nice dinner, maybe do some storytelling. You know how good I am at that! And then we're going to lie underneath the stars.. and see what pops up! So you mean you're going to get some cheap beer, pizza, rent a DVD... Show him what a fine catch you are? Oh, yeah! Because he's so nice, and friendly. Did I mention that? And he's interested in you? I know, weird huh? Yeah Well. Maybe you've mended your wicked ways. Maybe the nice guys are starting to see you for who you're becoming. Maybe. Yeah, no, I can't. But it sounded good. I liked it. So, you think this is gonna work out, huh? I don't think this is gonna work out. Hey Paul? Huh? You know what you could do, is you could go to the kitchen... And make me a grilled cheese sandwich. You are so good at it. You are really taking advantage of this, aren't you? Yes, I am. Heh. But you know what... I do appreciate you so much. Yeah, well. I know you would never single me out. You take advantage of everybody. Welcome to your weekend retreat! Alright. This place is very interesting. I am sorry that I have you so far away from everything. I know, it is quite a ways up here. Yeah, that was quite a drive. Way up here in the woods, huh? Kind of scary, but you know nice and private. Well, it is the last place anyone would think to look. For what? A body? Oh come one, you must think I am some kind of freak. I swear, my only intention for having you come up here is to enjoy a nice weekend. I SWEAR! You want something to drink? Yeah, sure, what do you got? Not much, but how about a water? Cool! Thank you. Are you ready to see the rest of the house? Let's go. Alright! We have the bathroom here. We've got the main living room area. Wow! TV, nice big couch if you want to just lay down and just relax... Then come on out here. We've got the den and sunroom-ish thing. Wow, what a view! Not a neighbor in sight. You know, I really don't know you that well, but I let you bring me all the way up here. Well, we've known each other for a couple of weeks. We had the dinner, we had the movie... Now we are up here and I really just wanted you to get away for the weekend and see it. I'm not a psycho killer. Yeah, well if you were, I would probably be dead by now. Alright, you first. So, do you always bring your dates up here? Not always, only the cute ones. Okay, that was way too corny. And you're a writer? Well, honestly I'm not very good at this whole dating thing. And I did just really want you to come up for the weekend and enjoy it. Nothing improper, I promise. Unless you wanted it. Yeah, well, this is sort of my fist guy date. You know, with you. Seriously? Yeah, yeah, it is. Really? Wow. So did the family pressure you to go out with girls? They do that whole 'heterosexual' thing? Sure, yeah, something like that. So this is your little family summer house? Yeah, nice and quiet. We've had so much fun here, so many good times. I'm really glad they got this place, and all the land around it. Yeah, it's a great place to bury a body. It's funny you should say that. What? Well, since I was a kid, I've heard lots of bizarre stories about things going on. Here in the mountains. Here in the hills. Alright, this is starting to sound creepy. What, you didn't notice it on the way up? Notice what? The land... it runs up against sacred ground. Sacred ground? You mean like a cemetery? Don't worry Danny, I'm here to protect you. Yeah. You're here to do something. So, all these windows... I'll bet it gets dark up here at night. Huh. You all right? Yeah, I'm just getting creeped out already. By what, this place? Come on. I was just messing with you. I've been coming up here every summer for years and nothing's ever happened. Alright. I guess I'll stay. Besides, if I did try to get away, I'd probably trip over some headstones... and the dead people would get me. Right? Wait! Danny boy, what's wrong? I'm sorry, I'm just... just kinda stressed, you know? I'm still not over the Dahlmer thing. Checking for knives, weapons... Well, I'm sorry. I probably shouldn't have brought you up here this early in the dating game. Yeah, well, I'm a big boy. I'll bet you are. And I'm a good Christian Boy. Okay, now I know you're trouble. So, what's the deal with your parents? I mean why would they buy a place so close to a cemetery? I don't know, maybe they like living next to dead people. I'm sorry. Enough. I guess the land was cheap. Yeah, you think so? You know, it's said that at midnight, they roam the cemetery. What, your parents? The living dead. Alright. That's enough. I'm sorry. I'm kidding. Everything's fine. I didn't mean to scare you. You're just too easy to scare, and I'm just too mean. Is this how it's always going to be? You trying to scare me? I mean, contrary to what your mama taught you, this is not the way to a man's heart. Ah, you haven't seen anything yet. You haven't Seen me in bed. God, I don't know if we are going to get that far. Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'll stop scaring you. No more. Ready? Yeah, popcorn. So, why are you so afraid of the dark? Our dad used to scare us all the time. You know he used to say he'd see something outside. And then he'd go out there to figure out what it was. We would wait there by the window for him. He'd get right up to that window, turn a flashlight on his face, and just scare the hell out of us. You ever consider therapy? My dad is a therapist. We never had any of that happy Brady Bunch bullshit. We had pain, anger, resentment... You know, typical American family stuff. Cookie? No, thanks. Well, what can I say? It just wasn't in my chart. This is depressing. Can we talk about dead people again? Guess what? What? I see dead people. Not funny. No, I'm serious. I see dead people, outside the window. Just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. You're too easy man, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There's too many windows. Alright, how about some real food? Sounds like a plan. Alright, I am going to go to the freezer. Hey, where are you going? Downstairs. To the freezer in the basement. The basement? Yeah. Go ahead, make yourself at home. I'll be right back. Or Will I? Great. Nice and quiet. Cemetery. Just great. Did you find it? Hey Kevin! Did you find it? Kevin? Are you down there? Real funny Kevin. I know this one. Try and get me outside and then you scare me. Or you're hiding behind the kitchen door. Yeah, real funny Kevin. You can do better than that. Kevin? Kevin? Hey found it! Got it all right here! Oh, shit! What's wrong? Shit! You almost gave me a stroke! Sorry about that. What's going on? Think you can scare me, huh? I don't know what you are talking about? With your little trick, running past the window? That's wasn't me. I have been down in the basement, getting the food. Yeah. Sure. Hey? You okay man? I'm sorry I scared you earlier. Alright, I got the food. Let's go to the kitchen. We'll go relax. Maybe watch some TV. Alright. Come on, man. It's cool. Sounds like a plan. Right? Yeah. We'll kick back,have a couple of drinks. Maybe there is something good on TV. This is cool. First movie night, now dinner at your place. Wonder what's going to be next? I told you this was going to be a fun weekend. So, what is the big folklore story up here? Since I ask. It's just some lame story, you'll just get spooked. Well, there is a cemetery just over the hill. No, that's not it. It's just some old story. That's right. You're not from around here... See all of us kids, we grew up hearing this story. The ghost story that was told around the campfire, you know. There was this guy, he was called The Zombie Killer. He had everyone around here shaking in their boots. And, he killed a bunch of local teenagers. And all the victims were hacked to death with an axe! And it always happened on a Saturday night. A night like this. Either at Lover's Lane, or at the cemetery. He was some escaped psychopath or something. From the mental institution just up the road, right? It's right over there. I'm just kidding. It's many many miles away from here. This all happened when my dad was still a young cop on the force. He had to deal With the dead bodies. Holy crap. Wonder how fast I could run if had to. So? What happened? Well, they eventually caught him and he was put to death. Except they say, he was already dead when they killed him. And they say he still roams these hills in search of new victims. You know the scariest part? All the teenagers are buried over in that cemetery. And so was he! Damn it! Why did you have to tell me that? Now you've got me all freaked out, and I'm definitely not in the mood. Well, I am sorry about that. Sounds like every other folklore story that every town has. It sounds like a bunch of crap to me. I never really bought into it. I've been coming up here for years, and I've never seen anything or heard anything. You want to go get some cake? Wait, wait, wait! I didn't tell you the most important thing! The one thing you never want to do! Great. You never want to say the killer's name five times in a row, or he'll come for you! But I never tried it. Oh Well! James Craven! James Craven! James Craven! James Craven! James Craven! Oh my. Cool. Aren't you a regular Mister Romance! Hmmm. Daddy says I kiss best. That's disgusting. So, are you ticklish? No. Don't even think of trying. I bet you are. No. I bet you're alot more wild than you come across. Stop! I can't believe you did that. Did what? Told me that story earlier. It's just a dumb story. See? Nothing happened. There's no curse, no killer, no Michael Myers! No Jason, No Freddie. They're coming to get you, Barbara! Wait, stop! Stop! Enough! Okay. Hey! Hey, what's wrong? What's wrong? Come back! It's just sounds outside. There's lots of things. You know, it's the wilderness. Are you sure that's what it is? I'm sure. Oh, it's probably just the cows. There is a farm not too far away from here. You think that's all it is? I'm sure that's what it is. Cows and dead people. We're out here in the wilderness and there's lots of holes. It's okay. Yeah. I just have this thing with cemeteries. And psycho mad men that invite me home. Okay. I'm sorry that I scared you earlier. I shouldn't have done that. Wait! Did you hear that? Yeah. The cow says "mooooo"! No. It's just the cows. I swear! No. I heard something. I definitely heard something, and it wasn't cows. Oh, now you're getting me scared. Yeah. I can really see that. Looks like it's going to be a movie night. Hey Danny, while you're over there, can you pick out a movie? Sorry, I don't have any porno. Since we're not going to be making any of our own tonight. Aren't you even the least bit concerned? Not really. I told you I have been coming up here for years. I've heard all kinds of spooky sounds. This is good cake. Shit. What was that? I don't know, I don't feel good about this, Kevin. It was just the wind, I promise. No! Kevin, why did you have to tell me that story? I gotta go! I can't stay here! It's the deck! It creaks! It's what they do. No! Besides, I thought you were going to stay for the weekend. No! That was your plan. Wait! Kevin! I just saw something through the window in the den. Come On! Hey! I know something that will ease your fears. Why don't you relax in my nice cozy bed? Now what's wrong? It's that noise again! Danny, there's nothing out there. There it is again! Alright, you had to have heard that! It keeps getting closer man! Yeah, yeah. I hear it too. It's just the wind, I'm telling you. Yeah, it's just the wind. Maybe. Yeah, well, maybe so. I don't know, this place really gives me the creeps. Hey! come on, come on, come on. It's probably a raccoon, or a bear or some animal. Or maybe cows mating. You know, like we should be doing. Okay, you had to have heard that. Not again. Now where are you going? Danny? Is there something you need to tell me? I keep hearing this noise. I think we should at least try to find out where it is coming from. I'm not just going to stay here while my heart explodes! What? Now you want to go outside? I think you've seen too many scary movies. I'm telling you it's just the wind. It's drafty up here. I hope you're right. This is crazy. You've made this all up in your head. Now, can't we go back inside and watch some TV? Come on. It's just a raccoon, I'm telling you. Are we ever gonna have sex? It's coming from out that way. It's just the wind in the trees or some animal. Damn, it's dark! Now Danny, if this is your way of telling me you're not gay... It's alright, buddy. Some of my best friends are straight. Do you by chance have any male friends who aren't gay, who just like to have sex with men? Okay, fine! I'm over this. What are you doing? I'm going to find out what's out there. I'm not going out without a fight. Wait, hold on. You don't have to prove anything to me. I just need to find out if it's Jason Voorhees or not. Hey! What if it is Jason Voorhees? There's nothing out here. I hope. It's just some animals, some stones on the hill, and a few hundred buried bodies. Danny Please tell me you just heard that! Holy shit. It's definitely coming from out there. I know going in that direction is definitely a bad idea. It's what you're doing! What are you doing? Nothing's going to happen! Fine! You want to find out? Come on, you want to die in the list reel? You know what? Just forget about it. There's nothing out there. You said so. Come on, Kevin! Okay this will be the part where you get killed! Jesus! Shit! What the hell is wrong with you? Sorry, I was worried. My heart's about to explode now, thank you! There's nothing out here. Let's go. Back inside. Alright. Ah, man. Alright, so maybe it was the cows. I hope. Told you. It's just the animals around here. You're just not used to the wilderness. Blocked ID. Hello? Hello? Fine. Don't say anything. Retarded. Ahhh! Hello? Hey! Hey! Why did you hang up? Well, because you didn't say anything. Who is this? So what's going on? Jason, is this you? What are you doing tonight? Well, right now I'm talking to you, and I still don't know who this is. Hello? Are you by yourself? I'm hanging up now. Wait! You don't want to do that. We haven't even had time to talk about anything. I have plans, and they don't involve you, so bye-bye! Come on, Kevin! Alrighty then, freak! I'll see you around! So what movie are you gonna watch tonight? Later, dude. Hey, what was that all about? Oh, it's just my friends playing a prank on us, I think. Forget it. Don't worry about it. Oh, sheez! Ok, asshole! This isn't very funny! I'm trying to have a private evening, nice and quiet, and you're interrupting. Now what do you want? I just want to talk to you for awhile. I'm trying to watch a movie, and you are not invited. You mean, it's just you, and your boyfriend? What? Which one of you should I slice first? You? Or your boyfriend Danny? You know, if this is one of my friends and I find out who's doing this, you're dead! No! You're the one that's gonna die! What? Be a shame if he had to go first. Before you even had a chance to get him in bed. What? I think someone's in the house with us. What! Shit! Call the police! Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Shit! Now I'm not getting any service. Danny What? Shit, Kevin! Kevin, this is definitely not good! Shit, no service. Danny, look out! Oh! My God! Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, my God! Shit Head! Son of a bitch! Steve! Fucking shitheads! Are you guys crazy? Jesus! Danny Oh, my God! What are you trying to do? Get yourselves killed? That's so funny! You guys are the best audience. Badass acting! Alright, alright. Who did the phone thing? Who was that? That would be Paul. He should have been here by now. You guys almost gave us heart attacks! Are you kidding me? That's not very cool, guys. If I had a gun, you guys would be dead by now. I do have a gun, Danny. It's in the bedroom. Go get it. I replaced your bullets with blanks way before you guys got here. You guys are so funny! You should have seen your faces. I thought you were going to shit your pants! You ladies can go change your panties now! Hey Danny. Good to see you again. It's okay little Kevvy, we're here now. We'll protect you. I need to go take a shower. I can't believe you guys planned that out so well. Nicely done. You had it coming. Say what? That fright night you planned for Josh and I? This guy is not as innocent as he seems. Yeah, I'm finding that out tonight. Let me guess. He's been trying to scare you from the first minute? Hey! They know you better than you thought. I was on a date. We decided to go up to the old grove. There's a lookout point up there. Make out point. Anyway, we were checking out the stars. You know, Just hanging out. So Kevin here and his buddies decide to play this big joke on me. Let's scare Jason to death. Which almost ended in my death. Yeah, I may have gone a little far that night. Here. Wipe your mouth. Poor Josh. He was upset for the longest time. It was funny though. I think he almost peed his pants. Ah, if I remember correctly, you were the one that peed your pants. Don't be mad, Kev. I had to get you back someday, and tonight was the night. Ah! You guys did do a fantastic job, I must say that. And Danny, I'm so sorry you had to be a part of it. But not really. So, is Kevin here Mr. Romantic? Huh? Huh? All over you like a schoolboy on prom night? Get away from me. Yeah, he's been trying all night. Been trying to scare me too. Not the crazy zombie killer story? Yep, that's the one. That story was made up so kids wouldn't make out in the cemetery. No, it's true. He had me going. Hey, I just tell it like it is. They told me that story when I was a kid. I've been scared every time I come up here. They told us that story as kids because it's fuckin' true, man. What are you doing? Hey so did you guys ever say the killer's name five times out loud? You know just to see if it was true? I don't think so, but I guess we could do it right now. How about we don't. Too late. Kevin already did it for me. He did? See, Jason here believes in the whole story thing. Probably because his dad named him after Jason Voorhees. No, he didn't! What are you so worried about? It's not that big of... It's not even a real story. Ah, jeez. Pussy. What are so worried about? It's just a fake story. Don't you remember as kids? Telling us not to say his name and shit? This town will get spooked by anything. I can't believe you said his name. Wait! Quiet! Did you guys hear that? I don't hear anything. Man, I can't believe you are so bothered by that. It's not a real story. You are such a fag. I feel kind of sick to my stomach. Yeah, me too. Oooohhh. Okay, okay. I learned my lesson. How about no more stories for tonight? My asthma’s acting up. What? Did you leave your inhaler at home again? I'll be right back. Oh, come on, come on... Damn it! Come On! Yeah, there we go! That's what I am talking about! Shit! Kevin? Jason, you fucker! Is that you? Danny? Fine! I'll fiX it all by myself! Just let me choke to death! No, no, no. We need sweets. Some of those ice cream bars or something. I'm calling Steve right now, before he gets too far. I have mine right here. I don't get any service. Shit, me neither. But you know what? Aha! He hasn't left yet. You might be able to still catch him. He's probably having engine troubles again. I'll go check it out. Hang on a second, though. You don't want to go out in the dark without some light. Oh, Jesus. Gosh. What's up there, Mister Banana Man. You're all peeled and ready to go. Mmm, that looks pretty good. Tasty, even. Oh, he's a biter! Steve! Hey Steve! Are you having engine troubles again? Do you need some help? I know you are not the best mechanic. Steve? Steve! Steve? What the hell? Steve? Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Call the police! Call the police! Call the police! Jason, what's wrong? Please tell me you guys are joking with me. What is it? What's wrong? Please tell me this is a joke. What joke? Where's Steve? There was this, this thing out there. I don't know, it got Steve! It got him! It killed him! It looked like it was eating him! What are you talking about? Did you see Steve? Well, well, no. But his flashlight was there, and this thing... Whatever it was, it was... it looked like it was eating him! Come on, come on, come on! We've got to call the cops! Come on! Jason, if this is one of your stupid jokes... No! It's not a joke! The phone doesn't work. Come on, we have to lock the doors! Lock the windows! Jason! What the hell is going on? I swear, if this is another one of your jokes... It's not a joke! He, he looked... I don't know. His face... It looked like, it looked like he was dead! If I hadn't gotten out when I did, something would have happened to me. I just know it! His face... you should have seen his face! Lock the doors! Lock everything! Shit, shit, shit! This isn't happening! Jason! What the hell is this all about? Wait you guys! Something just passed the window in the den! Just make sure everything is locked! Everything! Come on! Lock everything! Okay okay. Where's the cell phone? Who has a cell phone? Where's the cell phone? It doesn't work! Jason, if this is one of your stupid jokes I swear to God I'm going to kill you. No, it's not a joke! Oh my God, what if it's true? What if the story is true? What if it's that killer guy? That slasher guy? And you said his name! He said his name! It came true! No shit, man! What the hell is out there, you guys? Who has the cellphone? Who has the cellphone? It's dead! Where did I put it? Do you have one? No! I never thought I'd need a cell phone in this small town. How about now? I've never seen anything like this before. It was that dead killer guy! That slasher guy! You guys it's just Steve playing a joke. That story wasn't even real! I've made that shit up! We made that up when we were kids. Oh my God! Oh, my God, my God, my God! He's out for revenge! Don't you get it? The legend is true! That's why they warned us as kids not to say his name... And you said his name! I sure did. We're all dead, man! Hey! Hey! You have a gun! Yeah. You took all the bullets out of it. And what if it is Steve? Shit! Do you have any more bullets? No! We don't ever use a gun up here. What are you? Crazy? I had the bullets. I think I left them in the pickup. Way to go, idiot! You guys, this has to be a joke. It's just Steve out there messing with us. Shit, man! Shit, Shit, Shit. Poor Steve. I miss him already. He was so good in bed. Bed? Steve? YOU and Steve? What the hell!? Slut! I didn't want to tell you. Listen you guys! Can we just get back to our little problem here? Well shit, I don't know. Maybe something is wrong out there. Shit! We've got to get out of here you guys! Forget this! I'm not going out there! Alright, well we have to do something. Let's go. This is a nightmare. If it is Steve, I'm going to kill him! The cell phone's dead. Doesn't that tell you guys something? I say whoopty-fuckin-do to that, mister! Wait! Wait! Did you guys hear that? Yeah. What was it? It's just Steve messing around with us. He's just messing with you guys. It's that killer! I'm telling you, it's him. He's just playing with us. You guys, you guys. It's... It's trying to get us out there. I don't know. It could be Steve. You guys, it's just Steve working us. He's getting us all riled up. What if it is him? What if it is Steve? What if he's not dead? He could be hurt. We have to help him! And what if it's a trick, Jason? Wait, wait. What if it... What if it is... What if it is Steve? We have to help him. We have to go out there and help him! He could be dying! Or this could all be his big joke on us. We have to find out! Whatever it is, it's right outside the door. Jason Come on! We have to find out! Jesus! It's Steve! Holy shit! He's alive! Danny, Oh my God! It was a joke. See, I told you guys he was just messing with us. So are you going to let me in? Jason Come on, man. Open the door. I don't know, something's not right here. I'm home! Let me in. What's wrong? Why aren't you letting him in? Come on, man. Open the door! Come on! No more jokes. I'm sorry I scared you guys. I've been a bad boy. Come on! Let him in. Yeah. Come on, buddy, I won't do any more scary stuff. I'm hungry. I don't know. Okay! But you have to promise, no more jokes. Promise! Cross my heart and hope to die. Alright, he promises us. Ha, ha. I made a joke. Sorry guys. You should be. My heart's still pounding, jerk! Had you going, didn't I? Danny I was about to code. Guess, it's not that hard to scare you girls. Kevin Real funny man. That was mean. This joke thing is going to go all night. You're a dead man if you think you are going to get away with this. You are right about one thing. I am a dead man. It's no big deal, really. Dying was a little painful when it first happened, but now I just want to eat you guys. Sure, whatever you say Steve. You can eat Jason later. Wait, you guys. I think he's being serious. Something's not right here. What the hell are you trying to say man? The killer, when you say his name five times? Oh, enough of that five times shit. That story's not real. It was made up. What are you talking about? Things are different now. Were you upset, Jason, when you thought I was dead? Shut up, already. Of course, I was. We were good together! Hey hey hey, You going to be alright? Hey Steve! Did you bump your head outside or something? What's wrong with you? Here, come on. Let's sit down. What the hell? Oh my God, you guys. What? What do you mean, he's cold? Oh my God. Hey man. We've got to get you to a hospital. You know what? It's going to be alright. We're going to take care of you. Everything's going to be fine. Jason What's wrong with him? Jason What the hell happened to you out there? I don't know I was fixing the engine and... And this, this guy. What are you doing? What is it? I don't know. Kevin You guys, he's freezing cold. Holy shit! Oh my God. Oh my God Steve, The ki...the ki... The ki...the kill... You're going to be alright. Kevin come on. Come on. Whoa! Everything's gonna be alright. He's trying to bite me! What the? The ki...the ki... What are you trying to say? It's about...the Ki...Killers. What are you trying to say? It's not about the ki...killer coming back. It's about...about the victims. No, no, no, no! No! No! That's just a...that's just a story! Just a story! Jason! It's not about the killer coming back! It's about the victims coming back. It's about the victims, Jason! You have to get out of here. Just leave me. They're in the basement. Kevin! Danny! Where are you guys? Can't you hear them? Can't you hear them? They're coming, Jason! Kevin! Danny! Steve, you have to get out of here! Steve Jason! Go! Run, Jason! Just leave me! Kevin! Danny! Holy shit, man! What's wrong with you? Keep back! Come on, let me eat you. What!? The pain will be over really fast, it won't be that bad. Well, actually it will probably hurt you alot but it will make me feel real good! Look man, fuck that! No way! No! No way! You're not eating me! Just some brains... Come on, man. I can help you. You need help! Oh, that sounds like a good idea, if you could help me! Shit! Kevin! Help! Keep screaming, buddy. Sorry. They're dead. But they'll be back really soon. We could have a little reunion. You always fantasized about having three guys at once! Now we can make that fantasy come true! Paul! Thank God! Steve's gone crazy! Come on, We've got to get out of here! Ah ha! He's gonna kick your ass now motherfucker! I'm gonna get my ass kicked? Who do you think started this whole thing? Come on, man! Help! Somebody help me! AAAAAaaaaaahhhhh! (cup banging) Do you have to start this so early? What do you want? Where the hell are my pills? There! Right where they always are! They’re not there, Mr. Smarty! What the hell are those? Those are your pills. You think you are so smart about all this stuff. My back is killing me! Give me something for the pain! There. Come on! Give me my bottle! You know you can’t have that with your medicine. Just give me the bottle! Donny, we’ve gone over this a hundred times. You can’t mix alcohol with your pills. Now I’m going back to bed. Billy: You need to relax. Take it easy. Drink some of this. Here. I want to get up! I need to use the toilet. I’m never sure. I just might. And get me my Metamucil! You know, I’ve been thinking. That only means trouble. You know, Christmas is coming up. I was going to get the lights and ornaments out. I know you don’t want to spend money on a tree, but… I thought we could do something fun for a change. Whatever you want to do. I could make us some Christmas cookies. Maybe get us in the holiday spirit. Hey, knock yourself out, Santa. Here’s to a merry little Christmas. You know, I think maybe we should get someone to help out around here. Help take care of you sometimes. If I can get away for a day or two. Maybe see some old friends I haven’t seen for awhile. Why would you want to leave me alone with a total stranger? You know that nobody can take care of me the way that you do. You know I can’t be by myself. Well, we can get somebody that we both know. I need to get out, Donny. All I ever see is the inside of this house. I’ve been taking care of you for three years now. God, you’re so cheap. You have the money, why don’t we spend… Do we have any canned peaches? What? Do we have any peaches? I know we must have some. Come on. Sorry, Billy. I was listening. I hope you have a nice Christmas. Come on, Billy. Why don’t you give me a kiss? Just because we aren’t the perfect couple anymore doesn’t mean… I can’t steal a kiss now and then. This will all be yours when I die. But that won’t be for a very long time. (Danny Coughing) Quiet! (Coughing continues) Did you get the leaks in the ceiling fixed? Yes. And I put up some decorations for Christmas. Well, I’m glad you had something to do. Hope you have yourself a merry little Christmas. Shit. There goes my back again. Well, if you take your pills on time like you’re supposed to, you wouldn’t have that problem. Why don’t you shut your mouth? How can I get out of this place. I’m just so sick of it. You know, there’s a whole world out there to see. I’ll tell you what’s going on in the world out there. Violence, famine, war and murder. You know, there’s a lot of good things too. You just don’t want to see them. The only good thing I know is that we have a place to call home, foode in the icebox… And piece of mind. Besides, you probably just sit around in front of the T.V. all day. You never get anything done around here. How can you say that? You sit in this room all day, you don’t go anywhere! I run around you like some sort of slave. Cleaning up after you. This, that, Kitchen… Cleaning everywhere. I’m so sick of you whining all the time, and ragging on me for every little thing I do! I’m sick of this place! I’m sick of cleaning up after you! You never have anything nice to say! Don’t you even care about me? I’m sick of slaving all over your kitchen, all over your food! I’m sick of you! Well, golly gee whiz. It looks like you do have a little backbone. Want to fill this up on your way out to see the world? Stop it! Donny, please stop doing that. I never thought I’d be eating today. Here’s your mail. Do you need anything else? No, but are you forgetting something? What am I forgetting? My bib? Damn politicians trying to spend our hard-earned money. Please, won’t you help the mentally challenged? Yeah, Hitler had the right idea. Billy, this is terrible. Are you sure this is potato? No, I’m not… ‘cause it isn’t! It’s clam chowder. I wanted potato! Why don’t you get me a new cup, and this time make me what I wanted. You didn’t tell me what kind you wanted. What’s for supper tonight? I don’t know yet. Well, you better get working on that too. How about some, some… some beans and cornbread? That sounds good. Yeah, with this cold weather, we’ll need some hot food. Doesn’t that sound good, Billy? Billy, are you there? Billy! Are you listening to me? You never listen to me! Why don’t you ever listen to me? It’s because you’re watching that damn television all the time. You’re probably off in some dream world. You’re always sitting on your dumb ass, watching that T.V. and I don’t know what you do! How am I supposed to know what you do? You… you should be taking better care of me. Now I would like to eat my dinner, now can I please have my bib? Billy, that’s too tight. You’re choking me. (Donny gasping and choking) Say it now, huh? Billy: Shut the fuck up! Shut up! Why do you hate me so much? No more ragging me now, huh? Shut up! Fuck you! (Thunder) (Crickets and a shovel digging through the dirt) (Dog barks in the distance) Billy… Billy… Billy! Billy! Why? I’m just hearing things. This isn’t real. This isn’t real. Billy! Why did you do this to me? (Jingle Bells song playing) (Music stops abrubtly) Billleeeee… Billleee… (Thunder clap) Why? Okay, it’s nothing. It’s the wind. It’s only the wind. It’s only the wind. Only the wind. (Billy cries and mumbles to himself) He’s dead. The garden. The garden. No one will find him there. No one will find him there. No one will find him there. Why, Billy? I’m cold, Billy. (Dog barks) So cold… No! You’re dead! Billy! I killed you! You’re dead! This isn’t real. This isn’t happening. Go away! Go away! This isn’t real. I know you’re dead! I know you’re dead! You’ll take good care of me, won’t you Billy? Aaaaaahhhhh! (Subtitles by James Handshoe)
