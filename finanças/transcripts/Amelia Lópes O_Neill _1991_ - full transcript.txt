AMELIA LOPES O'NEILL The story of a faithful woman from the port of Valparaiso told by a sorry thief I read what you wrote about Amelia. Not everything is true! I know! I usually make up a large part of my chronicles. Better said, I imagine. This time your imagination fell short. Juanito! Well, I hear you. Amelia Lopes O'Neill I think I know you. That's impossible. ﻿No one knows me, I change my face every day. Are you a politician? I'm a magician. Is it a profession? No. A vocation. Well... I hear you. I am a magician, graduated in the best school in the world, not far from here. But it's not my story that I want to talk to you about. I want the world to know that Amelia Lopes O'Neill is not... was never what people... "believe". People will believe what I tell them. And will you tell me your true story? Amelia has been, is and will be a woman without history. No, she was not my wife, neither was my lover, we were friends. Bravo, in Berlin I met a magician almost as agile as you. Today Amelia is on everyone's lips. But whatever they say. No one will be able to tarnish her name! Nobody! Not while I'm alive. You're alive, but she... Listen. Beautiful music. In Paris I met a pianist who did it wonderfully well. You are not easily impressed! You are exactly the person I need. I'm all ears. Who was Amelia Lopes O'Neill? First of all, Amelia was a faithful woman. The only faithful woman I have ever known. And I know what it's like to be the faithful one! Look, this city... without going any further, I don't like it very much, to be honest. It's so sad, it makes you petty. This city kills us little by little. With that and everything, I have remained faithful to Valparaiso. Before I was a thief. And here they say that thieves are traveling birds. I have never stolen in another city. I remained faithful to this port I must say that it was in the exercise of my profession that I had the honor of meeting Miss Amelia Lopes O'Neill. Be careful Miss, it's too late! Don't you want me to escort you? At this time it's better not to risk it... Amelia! Amelia come here! - Ame, Ame... - Ana! - Ana, Ana. - Ame, Ame... Please calm down, Ana! We have to take her to the hospital! Amelia, I have to show you something. Come. In Miss Lopes' house there was nothing worth stealing. Almost nothing. A ring, empty coffers, unpaid bills, unfulfilled promises. Before dying Don Carlos made me swear to only open this little box in case of life or death. Now it's the case! I have to go see this person. She is crazy! Days later I saw Amelia again under similar circumstances. We had been preparing a robbery at the office of one of the best-known lawyers in Valparaiso. I was in the office... hiding, waiting for everyone to leave, when Amelia unexpectedly entered. Time is cruel. ﻿The last time I saw you, you were a girl and I held you in my arms. We took a walk around the port. Your father was in great shape and my wife was still alive. How quickly time passes. That year we saw the Governor's Chair four times. Something exceptional! Of course this year is too. The bad thing about it is that... I am obliged to deny it in official meetings. It's amazing how the years go by! You look like my current wife's older sister. You didn't get married? Yes, people thought we were brothers, your father and I. What an absurd accident! I'm sure he died laughing out loud. But you didn't come here so we could talk about this. Sit down. Yes, she wanted me to take care of her children posthumously, let's say. But don't think you're the first to come... you're old enough to know that. Your father had several families, and when I say several, I'm not talking about two or three. But you, you are not like the others, you are like your mother. I knew her very well. Look! We were boyfriends but she preferred your father. Finally... you are nothing like her, I see that you get to the point. You came to ask me for money that doesn't belong to you. I do not owe you anything. Do you know what my motto is? Money calls money. But you have to get your hands dirty to get it. You understand me, right? Of course you do! We are equal. No. I thought that he left us money in case of need. That's all. I made a mistake. But does not matter. In that you are just like your mother! There is not only the money. Are you interested in the rest? I don't understand you. I'm not like the others, make no mistake. - Goodbye. - Hang on a minute. How strange, one is capable of anything to satisfy certain whims. Come closer. Don't be afraid, I'm not even going to touch you. Look! The Governor's Chair. An illusion! People say it is a ghost island, the island of the dead. You already know things like that. Can you hear me? Listen to me. Now you're going to do something very... very dirty. You're going to get naked. Take everything off. Of course I will have the decency not to look because I am a gentleman. However, from now on we will know... that a very ugly thing has happened between us. No, I don't want to! But it is not out of modesty, but because you consider it that way. You are just like your mother! Don't you want the check? And when she came out, I couldn't stop following her. She walked towards the port and stopped in front of "The Happy Stone". I know you hate that place, but she liked to go there. She would spend hours observing the unlucky lovers come and go, the prostitutes, the crazy ones. If I could kill myself several times a day for you, I'd do it immediately. I want to die with you! - Let it be now! - No... How strange... it seems that the wind would carry the voices. Create and destroy relationships. I was reading in the hotel bed and I heard the inconsolable crying of a woman. I thought it was an illusion, but when I looked I found you in the distance, and I knew that the wind wanted to bring us together. I'm a romantic, you know? Leave me, I need to be alone! It's just that I'm the one who brings loneliness! All the women who met me know it. Do not be afraid. It saddens me. Today is my birthday, I'm celebrating it! Don't you want to accompany me? Don't look at me like that! You're just doing your job... You have to respect your clients! Look me in the eyes, and promise me that you'll never do anything like that again. Don't go! Don't go, I'm a bit of a doctor, I can help her. Mrs... I'm here to die. Mrs... I don't want to go alone. It is not true that the people of Valparaiso like nightlife so much. It barely gets dark and decent people lock themselves in their house, not out of fear. It's from pure pettiness, not to spend. They turn off the lights and spy on us from the darkness. And when hearing the wind whistling, they close their eyes and nightmares come! Let no one be mistaken, let's not fool ourselves... When night falls, whoever walks down the street in Valparaiso, It's because it's up to no good. It's because they are bad people like us, or worse. And from time to time, far away, a lady from a good family, drifting, desperate, as if she's lost. A tea with milk. Do you know that one? No. I don't know her. Thank you. A "gin-with-gin". Amelia Lopes? Yeah. I don't think you recognize me, we haven't seen each other in ten years! But I see you on the street from time to time. My mother lives near your house. I don't remember her... My mother was your mother's dressmaker. We were friends. And one day your mother decided that I was not good company for you. You were ten years old. She died a long time ago... I hate her! Well... she has already died... Let me introduce myself: They call me Ginette la Rouge. I'm an artist. Nice to meet you. Sit with me. It's not cool to be alone. How did you land here? I was cold. And that's why you were crying? No, it wasn't for that. I never cry. I hate people who cry. My daughter never stops crying. But you, you are my friend and I forgive you everything. How's your sister? Very badly. And your father? It's true... he died. Forgive me. I read it in the newspapers. - Were you crying for him? - No. No. I don't know why I was crying. Who is she? A friend. What's happening? She doesn't want to be with me. Do a trick for her! - He is a magician. - I can see that. We have a number in the "Taproom". Will you join us? You'll be my guest. Do you want to come? Of course! You are not proud like your mother! That night, Amelia decided to stay with us. I told myself: "She's going to end up getting bored, she's going to leave..." And when we realized that she wasn't planning to leave, that she was going to stay all night, we said to ourselves: "What is she looking for?" I thought: "What happened is that she recognized the stolen ring." No, it's not for you! "When she gets out of here she's going to report us and they're going to put us all in jail." This ring has never existed, it was an illusion! But we were wrong. - With her, one was always wrong. - My ring, my ring, you are a thief! We start in half an hour. Come with us, you'll see my number. If you don't come I'll think you despise me! Then I will accompany you by taxi. In our cabaret, we could find the best and the worst. Or, as we used to say, the worst of the best and the best of the worst. What's the matter? - I'm "desesperate". - It is said desperate. No, I'm "desesperate". Look! Ladies and gentlemen! This chest comes from Cueva del Chivato. And it belonged to Francis Drake! Look! Paint my lips. Now I'll do your makeup... Like every Tuesday at 1:30, The neighborhood doctor appeared. As he demanded, we treated him as if he was coming for the first time. - A sun and shadow. - As usual, he approached the bar. As always, he searched for a new face in the women's tables. Will you dance the next bolero with me? I think you are wrong. What does it mean? I am not from here. I was about to leave. Isn't she from here? Yeah! Like everyone... go dance with him. Just a bolero. Go ahead and dance! Will you dance the next bolero with me? I think you are wrong. I'll introduce myself, my name is Fernando Marin. Are you new here? I am not from here. Don't tell me, what's your name? And you, do you always say your name? - Sure. - Aren't you afraid to say it? Are you? No, but I already told you, I'm not from here. Where are you from? I wanted to say that I never come here, or very rarely. And I think I won't come back. In that case, will it be the last time we see each other? That's how it is. And elsewhere? Do not make fun of me! Of course all girls must say the same! I don't know, I don't know them all... Lend me your handkerchief. Why did you do that? Don't you like it more like this? I don't know. You look different. Yes it is different, do you like me with more makeup? Yeah. Have I hurt you? Yeah. I'm sorry. But is that... with the makeup you seemed more... hm... I meant to say less... More or less what? What do you choose? - You were more suited to this place. - So what? I'm sorry! I didn't want to offend you. What can I do to make you forgive me? Guess it. - It is cooling down. - Yeah. Thank you. Let's walk a little and then I'll escort you. It is about to dawn. I have an office near here. And I have another one downtown. I'm here from 3 to 5 every day. You already know where to find me. If you have a problem don't hesitate to come see me. Come. No. Where are you taking me? Let me go. No. Won't you ask me anything? Not even if I'm married? No. I don't have a very good memory, but how can I forget a night like that! It was the same night that they were mourning one of the three American cigarette smuggling bosses. They buried him at dawn. How are you? Who died? The dwarf Farias. They killed him the day before yesterday. Those smugglers do not forgive. And you, how are you, do you want a painkiller? No, thanks. I'm sorry. I couldn't guess. I had already been told that some women from good families came down to the port to have fun. But how was I supposed to know that you were a virgin... If you have any problem, come see me. Don't go to the other office, come to this one. You are the first. You will say the same thing in a few months with more conviction. The first and the last. Here, is that enough? Don't know. Take double, okay? I don't have the slightest idea. Now you are a professional. Take it all, that's all I have! We, those of Cerro Mariposa, we believe that souls appear when the frost falls, and almost always after an earthquake, or a crime, or while some authority is buried. So it was. Because in that same morning, they say, the late Lopes decided to visit his family for the first time. - Dad. - And from that day on, the late Lopes repeated his visit every Tuesday at 8:20. Where is Ana? - She is she sleeping. - That's weird! Ana. Ana! Get up, Ana, get up! I'm going to die, little sister. What will you do without me? Of course you're not going to die! We'll take you to the hospital. No! I don't want to! I don't want to! Come on! And the painkillers? Petronila! It hurts. It hurts me. It will pass. Dad came to see me. He told me I had to meet him. Try to sleep. And you? You will stay here. You will be able to get married, have children, and you'll be happy. - Come on, take this. - Why? It will calm you down, take it. No, that's useless. Come on, take it! And these photos? They are mine. Why haven't you ever shown them to me? Because they are mine. Who is he with? Guess it. Days after, Amelia began her long walks around the city. Twice a week we saw her crossing our neighborhood, heading to the Customs warehouses, then quickening her pace she headed towards the Happy Stone, where she would stay for hours hearing the cries of the guilty lovers. In those days I got into the habit of visiting Amelia's house, I arrived at night, walked around the block and I would leave. I never stole or touched anything. That's why I think I'm the only one who truly knows the house of air drafts. Lieutenant Fernandez finished his deck patrol... I wish you would come more often, Boss! When girls are alone they do whatever comes to mind, They ignore me! The girls are leading a bad life. Lately they say that you are already dead! Thank goodness you're back, or else... I don't even have a cent and I still have expenses! And I don't have a penny. - Good morning, young lady! - Good morning. My mom is imagining things... She's thinking that I am your father, but it will pass. Yes I know what happens! I am not crazy! That's what I believe. What to do... You have to talk to someone with the things that happen in this house! Well, mom, I'm leaving. So soon? But we barely talked... Yeah, and whose fault is it, hm? When will you come back? Next month. - Dad! - Oh my God, Ana! Dad! - Ana! - Dad! Anna, stop it! Dad! Is my dad... Petronila! Here... Calm down, Ana. Here... Ana. The sheet... good. Here. You'll be fine... We must call a doctor immediately! He won't want to come. What are you saying? Why not? Call him yourself. He won't pay attention to me since we've never paid him. But this is an emergency! Miss, just a few minutes. She is very weak, your sister lost a lot of blood. It's better that you come back tomorrow. Amelia! I had such a strange dream. Don't speak... We took a boat ride with dad. And then he... he was taking us to an island, but when we reached the center of the lake dad told me: "Let's go see your sister's boyfriend." I saw a man in white, who was sweeping between a long... row of coffins. Then, Dad said: "It's nap time!" He got into a coffin... and immediately thousands of sparrows landed on him. I started to laugh, but you... you made me shut up. Then we both got into some coffins. There were many people, but they had no faces. Then the man took a box of matches... and he lit the candles, the candles... of a wedding cake. The island began to move, then we left, on the other side of the sea. You and I were dressed as brides. The flames burned the clothes... that turned red like blood. And later black, very, very black. ﻿Ana, you must rest. - I'll see you again tomorrow. - No please, don't leave me alone! - See you tomorrow. - No. Please come out, Miss! Your sister must rest. Yes doctor. Amelia is him! The man of the island... - Look at these! - Who are they? My toys! I do whatever I want with them. Look what I do with the others! Have you seen this one? I cut off its head, But I haven't erased its face, see? You are a very bad girl. But not with you, I'm good with you because you play with me. Where are you going? Don't go! Don't leave me alone! - Good night. - Good night. Do you want an explanation? Yeah. Is that why you came? Well yes, That's what I've come for. Aren't you satisfied with my letter? Your letter fell into the hands of my wife. - It entertains you? - No. Why didn't you destroy it? - I don't know. - Did you at least read it? No. And she... she didn't read it to you? She has her dignity. I imagined. - What did you say in the letter? - The letter? Nothing special. It said that I love you. Even if you share your life with another woman. It also said that I forgive you and that I'm waiting for you. Amelia, let's see if you understand it once and for all: We are not married, and we never will be! Why? Why would I do it? Because I'm Amelia Lopes O'Neill. Let's go to a quieter place. To your office? Are you crazy? Yeah. Did you really wish you'd never met me? Yeah. And neither would you have married me, even knowing that I am a Lopes O’Neill and that I will be faithful to you forever? No. And you don't even find me pretty, or intelligent, and you would prefer any whore rather than a woman like me. It is probable. And then? Then what? Then? I don't know what to think. Are you happy with your wife? Yes, extremely happy. Does she know it? No, she will never know! Why? She has enough with her illness. Is she sick? Very sick. Does she know it? No. So... I like it, because she seems invisible. Are you surprised? I have the feeling of never having seen her. Sometimes I even have a hard time recognizing her. The only thing I see in her is her suffering, her pain. That's what I like about her. But you seem happy. No, is not that... serene, I would say. So what? Nothing. I bore you. It's normal, we are married. You don't love me anymore. It's not that. Goodbye. Wait, don't you want me to pay you? No, it's not worth it! I want to pay you. Whatever you want. Take. And another thing... we will not see each other again. Whatever you want. Anyway I'll wait for you. You're going to waste your time. What are you doing here? I'm waiting for my mom. Mom told me that if I don't move from here all my wishes are going to come true. Aren't you cold? Never. How do you think I'll be able to have everything I want? I don't know anything about that. You should know it. I want to have money. It's the only thing I like. ﻿I don't like to spend it, I like to look at it and smell it. Close your eyes. It was May 21. I've never liked patriotic holidays because they bring bad luck. And that time was no exception. Ginette fell in love with a student, and left with him for Santiago, leaving me with Lili. They were difficult days... You won't believe me but it was thanks to Amelia that I was finally able to find Ginette, It was the time when her walks were starting to get longer and longer, she walked as always at random and sometimes, for no reason, she would suddenly enter one of those crummy restaurants that are abundant in the port neighborhood. It's been a long time since we've seen each other! I'm dead! Thank goodness I don't work on the street. I only travel in first class! Doctors, lawyers... I know I shouldn't talk about that. It's not right. I should act like we don't know each other, but I thought we were friends! It's not that... I've lost my way a little... I don't know what's happening to me. You're in love? No. One is always the last to notice! No! I'm not in love. It's more than that! I know what it's like to be in love. And I assure you that is not my case. I'm married, that's all. When? You know it! With him? But he is married! I already know it. He takes me for a whore, but it's not true. We are forever married. Don't try to understand me. It is enough for me to understand myself. Are you sure? Yeah. In that we are different... I am sure of what is happening to me. But does he know? Yes, I wrote to him several times. I have explained it to him. His wife also knows it. You are crazy. Completely crazy. No, no, I'm just a faithful woman. When my father was alive maybe he would have agreed to do frivolous things, he would have forgiven him. But he is no longer around to do it and now I must be a daughter... a model daughter. Mercurio newspaper! Mercurio newspaper! Mercurio newspaper! The newspaper, boss? Then came the difficult days. Our cabaret was closed after a pitched battle between Swedish and Spanish sailors, which left some dead. Among those who were arrested was Amelia. That's how the scandal broke out. HIGH SOCIETY LADY ARRESTED FOR DEPRAVITY Good morning. You don't know me. No, but I appreciate you coming. I have very few visitors. I don't know if I should thank you. I am Fernando's wife. Do you miss him? No, possibly not. You are very worthy. I decided to come because Fernando didn't want to. I know that you see each other. It's true. Poor Fernando! He tries to hide it from me. He loves you. That's what he says. It's his technique. He tells them all the same thing, to inspire them confidence. It's curious. He is very cunning and naive at the same time. I don't know. I don't know what kind of man he can be, Fernando. I only know that he came to me, he wanted to buy me, and that I sold myself to him. We all sell out. Yeah. But I've only sold out once. You don't even believe what you say! You keep giving yourself, and not always for money! That is not true. He gave me money, and I surrendered. And is it forever? Yeah. I would like to believe it. You know I'm telling the truth. ﻿No one will believe you, least of all Fernando! My father would have believed me, but he is dead. I too will die soon. Look, I'll promise you something... If the beyond exists, I will pray that Fernando sees clearly and loves you. It's not worth it. Why? Because I don't love him. I'm a faithful woman, that's all. Ana. Someone is asking for you! - Who is it? - A woman that didn't want to go in. Why? She said she didn't want to. Good morning, young lady. You don't remember me. We met years ago, when I lived in this neighborhood. I am a friend of her sister, and I bring a message from her. Come on. No, thanks. I can't enter in the house of well-off people. Do not say that! We are no longer well-off. You're wrong. Your family's honor is intact. Your sister is a very respectable woman. That's not what they say out there... but I appreciate that you want to comfort me. I guess you don't believe me! No, no, don't think that. You said something about a message, didn't you? Yes. Here it is. What does this mean? She said you would need it. I don't want this money! Please leave. Take it, it's an order! Please leave. When you accept the money! It's mine, Amelia gave it to me. I see her every day in jail. I take care of her and I don't like her being put down. Take it! Well... thank you so much. Do you know what I discovered then? I realized that Amelia's absence made me want to steal again. It was at that time that I made my most notable robberies! ﻿I told myself: "It's okay to steal." "By stealing I am revenging the injustice they committed with Amelia." I made contact with my old classmates in the Academy of the Agile Hands, at least they respected me. They knew that I was much more than a thief: I was an emeritus academic! Because outside the Academy one comes out as a magician, a fine locksmith, a mechanic, even an inventor! After three months, and without any intervention from the Lopes family, Amelia was released. No charges were maintained against her. I hope we'll see each other more often. - You told me that you had a message? - What? You told me about a message from my husband. Ah, him! Yeah, him. He didn't seem very worried. The truth is that he is overwhelmed with everything that has happened! - What happened? - Don't you know? His wife... What happened to his wife? She died 5 days ago. Stop here! Stop right here! What's wrong with you? I don't understand you. I am Fernando's wife. I beg you, don't forget it! She is as crazy as her father... In those months so many things had happened: Big scams, big parties, various scandals. Each of the inhabitants of Valparaiso already had an opinion on Amelia. Neither scandalous nor compassionate, they laughed at her. They thought that what happened to Amelia was terribly comical. And since it was spring, everything had to be fun! We already know that the spring is the time of joy, of the homeland, of kites. A plague, the famous kites! They come in, they come out, I don't know where the money comes from! The ladies are each on their own! You should do something, boss. And those gentlemen who say they are their friends... and Don Fernando who comes and goes as if he was in his own house! Mom, they're going to hear you. The lady is here. She will end up believing that you are serious, that this is not a joke. These English people are all the same! They look like kids... you know one, you know them all! Who are you? Introduce me, dear. He is my husband. His name is Aliro Valdes de la Parra. He was a friend of your late father. He was a very good friend. If you knew how he felt when he found out about his death. Good morning, I was also your father's friend. He is the blind Valdes. ﻿My name is Sean O'Ryan, Captain of the Merchant Marine. They've been waiting you for three days. This gringo and I have a debt with his father. Not me, I paid him mine! My husband promised to build you a house when you get married. And I was in charge of ordering the wedding dress from Italy. And the groom's from England. He came up with the idea of ​​the chest, to make it look like a pirate's treasure trove! I already have the plans for the house. But who is the gift for? For me or my sister? I didn't know there were sisters, he told me: "It's for my daughter!" It must be her. What if is for the other one? Bad luck. I hope you like the gifts. And I think that they are not the only ones, right, white girl? I don't think many people received orders from her father or kept the money to this day. I'll get my sight back before that! When you went to Santiago on vacation your father came here with me to fly kites. What a champion! There are lucky people and unlucky people, I, for example, am not lucky. Nothing ever happened to your father, who was so in love! Me, on the other hand, who rarely had a little fling... Look how I turned out. They attacked my husband with acid and deformed his face, he went blind. It was all over the newspapers. In the English bar they call him "The Phantom of the Opera"! In the end, only way is to marry the maid! Isn't that right, white girl? Miss, are you feeling bad? No, it's nothing. - What's going on? - She's crying. Don't worry! It's not important. Do you want something to drink? No, daughter, thank you. We're already going. Shit! They cut me off! Nobody plays fair in this country! Good morning. What is this? This is for you. Your wedding gift. I accepted a bartender position. I had stopped stealing because I knew she was free. I almost never saw her, but I knew she couldn't be far away She hasn't come. She's not in "Taproom" either. Don't be surprised. You don't know me, but I do know you. I'm Amelia's friend. From what I see she has many friends in this bar. No, you're wrong! Around here, people respect and love her. Definitely. Well, I must see her. Do you want to leave her a message? I have nothing to say, her sister does. She wants Amelia to come back to her house. If she doesn't want to, at least she should make an appearance Saturday at the Church of Sacred Heart. After the wedding, if she wishes, she can leave. If I see her I'll pass the message. - Thank you. - Don't you want to have a drink? No, thanks. Don't you want to wait a moment? Maybe she shows up. I doubt it, goodbye. Hello Doctor!

We can't talk here. ♪ Summer ♪ - Come on. - ♪ The hand ♪ ♪ Autumn ♪ ♪ A sapling ♪ ♪ Winter ♪ ♪ Hell ♪ ♪ That's love ♪ ♪ Yes sir ♪ Should anyone present know of any reason that this couple should not be joined in holy matrimony, speak now or forever hold your peace. Me! Me! Fernando. Do you accept Ana as your wife and promise to love, respect and be faithful to her until death do you part? I do. Ana, do you accept Fernando as your husband and promise to love, respect and be faithful to him until death do you part? I do. I saw the doctor quite often. He wanted to meet Amelia at any cost. He knew that she was pregnant and was determined to avoid any scandal. Several times a week he would pass by the bar and would send threatening messages to Amelia. More than once he made me do some run-and-tell, but Amelia refused to see him. On those days she found refuge in Mrs. Antonia's house, Ginette's mother. A few months later Cristobal was born. It is awful! I have never seen anything so ugly in my life! We should kill him! He will be very good looking when he grows up. - I don’t believe it! - Look at his eyes! Yeah, but he's stupid, he doesn't even know how to speak! Where is Amelia? Don't know. I want to ask you something. It won't be for tonight! - Why? Are you going out? - Yeah. - Oh, can I go too? Can I? - Yes, my love. The boy is still very small. If something happens, what do I do? ﻿You know where to find us.﻿ He will look a lot like you. I have a name, my name is Pamela! - Have you changed your name again? - It's my stage name. Amelia! I lost sight of her. 7 years passed, of which I don't remember anything. Absolutely nothing. I had gotten used to Amelia's presence. But the world continued on its course. People died, left, and of course, now we had to count on Cristobal, the newcomer. During the day, Amelia lived only for him. But as soon as night came she completely forgot her son. She left the house, went down to the port, to the slums, and there she would settle in any bar and wait. In one of those bars she ended up finding Fernando. Good night. Have you been waiting long? No, not much. I have traveled a lot lately. And I took Ana to Europe for treatment. She is much better. Maybe we can have a child next year. And Cristobal, how is he? Why? Do you want to take him? Yeah. So, try it! Amelia, you must understand. You won't change your life. You like what you do, but he... Look at those people! Do you like to see your child living in this environment? Could be worse. You could say that time had stopped... Do you want to come with me? We told ourselves: "They are together, everything starts again..." Yeah. We saw them leave together. Cristobal saw them and followed them secretly. As if he knew the way. Do you remember the Condell Galleries? Before there was a movie theater that showed those love and adventure movies. Mrs. Ana liked to go to that movie theater in the afternoons, so she had to pass right in front of her sister's store. She always walked past her, pretending not to see her. Which gave a lot to talk about. Until one day, she ended up deciding to nip that "what they will say" in the bud and faced her rival. Go play somewhere else. You'll end up burning the dresses! Lili, Lili! I don't want to play with you! You can't find me! And my name is not Lili, I'm Gina. Cristobal, Cristobal enough! Cristobal come here right now! Come here. - Is it him? - Yes it's him. I don't know why I did it. He should have married you, he loves you. What are you saying? I do not know anything about that. I only know one thing... he can't love me, because I'm not sick. I don't have that luck. - What do you mean? - Do you think he loves you? Possibly. You are sick. He loves your illness. Not you. He healed me himself. I'm not the same anymore, do you understand? All the more reason! I'd be careful if I were you. I already told you that Cristobal liked to spy on his mother. He followed her wherever she went. People knew and protected him. She sometimes crossed paths with him without even recognizing. He stayed there, as if lost, but without complaining. He never cried. He never laughed either. Are you forgetting something? - Amelia! - What? Now I'm sure, at least I think. What are you sure about? It's too late. Oh, yes! Do you love me? Yeah. It's not a reason not to pay me. Pay me. Here go! Nothing else? Yeah. Well, I appreciate it very much. Cristobal! Mommy! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Oh my love. Fernando! For two weeks, Cristobal's life was hanging by a thread. And suddenly, one day, turned out that he was out of danger. He recovered quickly, almost too quickly. But he became nervous, irritable and fragile. Amelia decided to take him out of Valparaiso. Are there animals too? - Of course, many! - And also wedding dresses? There are wedding dresses everywhere, my love. I want to leave tomorrow. No, because you are still very weak. No I'm not. Surprise! Close your eyes! You have a visitor... - Hello! - Nothing else? Do you still want to marry me? No, I do not want any more. What a pity! And my gift? I want my gift! But you still can't eat it! - Then what is it for? - You'll have to wait. Hello, how is the patient? Mom, he won't let me get up to call you on the phone. He's right, you're still very weak. Because he is always right! Cristobal, the man has a name, his name is Fernando. Is not true! He has no name, I don't like him. He is awful, I'll close my eyes right now and you'll see how I'm not going to open them until he's gone from here. It didn't take long for Amelia to become known as a dressmaker. She earned a lot and had enough for everything. Meanwhile, Lili became the girlfriend of a Swedish sailor. Blood red and very tight. That's why I'd prefer you to make it, my grandmother would never do it! Come here. Hey Lili, are you in love? Women never fall in love! And even less for foreigners. And why are you getting married then? Because he lives far away and gives me dolls. You're too old to play with dolls! Be still! When we get married we are going to live here. And the boat, is he going to leave it? He's going to do whatever I want! Hello! Who are you greeting? My dad. Since he went to Limache, Amelia came much less to the bar. But once a month we saw her enter like a soul in pain... she sat at her usual table in the back of the room and waited. She waited in vain, because Fernando was not coming. He couldn't come. Are you crying? I can't. You can see him. Come with me. What's the matter? Hello Cristobal! Sing me something. I don't know how to sing. Yes, you do know how to sing. Amelia! Amelia, hurry up, come! Amelia! Amelia, Cristobal is dead. That was the year of misfortunes! The year of the flood, the flu epidemic, the year of the general strike, of the customs fire. Who was going to notice Amelia's misfortunes? Everyone had forgotten her. Despite herself, Amelia ended up returning to her sister. They never separated since. They had the habit of going out to eat ﻿every Sunday night in a restaurant not far from The Happy Stone. Regarding the facts, I read everything I know in your Wednesday chronicle. But, what I read felt like I lived it myself. Right now I can see and describe the scene. I see the waiter approaching Fernando and speaking to him, as he stands up and runs towards the Happy Stone, where they say they've seen Ana walking... Now I'm seeing Amelia. She is alone, she finds the goodbye letter her sister left her. But she doesn't feel nervous. It's not the first time that her sister tries to end her days... She now hears the screams of people coming and going. She now sees the accident. I'm looking at Amelia witnessing the tragedy of Fernando falling between the rocks, how the waves swallow him... I see her staying there, motionless, perplexed, absent... No! Leave me! No! I want to die! I want to die! Leave me! At first, she didn't want to leave the bedroom. Then she returned to her nightly walks. But she no longer went to bars, just walked thought the streets like a sleepwalker. People began to say that crossing paths with her brought good luck. This was how Amelia entered in the legend of Valparaiso. I think I was the only one who frequented her house at that time. Of course Petronila had taken me for her boss, or worse, for her own son who died at sea. That's how I ended up as a part of the house of ghosts, I felt like a ghost myself! Fernando. I don't remember when the seances started. Everything happened plainly, without any special ritual. He is coming! He's with dad. No, with Cristobal. No. It's Ms. Antonia. Ms. Antonia is not dead! But there are no dead people here... Dad wants to talk to us. Oh, Sir! He always had a sense of humor! The last time I saw her, I must say that I was drunk, very, very drunk, but believe it, I remember everything. Are you coming to see us? No, I don't have much time, he has summoned me. Who? This time, everything will go very well. You don't care if I go, I have to concentrate! Of course not. I feel like I'm seeing her there, motionless, like a statue. It seemed like she wasn't even breathing. I could have intervened and I didn't. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself. It's funny how quickly time flies! Do you remember the first time we met in The Happy Stone? Yeah. I've had to wait so many years. I have also waited for you. Yeah. We're made for each other. I want to cry. But don't worry, I'm not going to do it. It's over. Nothing can happen now, we are forever united. Were you faithful to me? Yes. Really. Are you sure? It's the only thing I'm sure of. Totally sure. There is no longer the slightest doubt, it is you! What is your name? Whatever you like. Fernando. Don't you mind? Let's go. Let's go. AMELIA LOPES O'NEILL FOUND DEAD Yes, Don Joaquin, that was Amelia Lopes O'Neill. According to you: Did she love Fernando? We will never know that. That's what I feared. So I have the right to imagine. I told you what I know... except one thing. But I'll keep that to myself. Why? Because it can't be told. But you're a magician, magicians can make things visible... Yes, it's true. It's true. Look me in the eyes. Is that a dream or is it a real scene? The house got in fire. All its occupants died. But... what you made me see, have you seen it with your own eyes? I haven't believed my eyes for many years. From what you have told me, one concludes that none of the characters were bad. If I believed you, I would have to conclude that these people deserve canonization! I don't think so, Don Joaquin! Don't think that good feelings are good and bad feelings are bad! I have only met good people throughout my life, and I'm telling you something: There is nothing more terrible than good feelings when... because fate wanted it, they are paid only with good feelings. If there wasn't a little bit of evil, the world would be hell! Interesting... - Can I repeat it? - That's what I'm here for. For you to tell the story. Only someone as bad as you could make Amelia's story believable. I'll try to do what I can. It's going to be easy, because I don't believe a single word you told me. Even better! There is something that I don't understand: Amelia died a week ago and I haven't heard of any fire... There are so many! True! Especially at the end of the year! By the way, it's time to go! Don't you worry, everything is paid for... Don Joaquin! You're forgetting this... Translated by whateverest (with original transcription by pacoss)
