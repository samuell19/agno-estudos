Jo, we're here! - Paco? - What? - Will we have a dog in Rio? - No. - How about a cat? - No. Why? Can we talk about something else? Joana, why are you allergic to cats? - I just am. - But why? That's the way it is, Leon! I didn't choose to be allergic! - Who did? The cats? - No. Puss in Boots? Traitor! Oh, no... I'm sorry! UNREMEMBER I win! Hi, kids! - Hi, dad! - How are you? Fine. - How was school? - Good. Get up! I kept your order. Yeah, I noticed. Are we taking all this to Rio? - Leon? - What? - Help me find the hammer? - Where is it, dad? I don't know. - At long last! - Hi. - How are you doing? - Fine. - Aren't you late, Paco? - Yeah, I'm heading out. Leon? - What? - Come here! What are you looking for? Come here! I want to show you something. My teacher said there are jaguars in Rio. Your teacher's crazy. Jo, how are you? - You're home early. - Yes, my substitute's already here. So you won't get your whole salary. Yeah... Have you started packing? I thought you might give your friends some gifts... You could sell these books. Make a little money. You've read them. Are you crazy? I'm not giving my books away. Luis isn't giving his books away either, just ask him. Luis, are you selling your books? - Are you nuts? - I can sell some toys if you want. And have you started packing? Abu! Ladybug? - Abu, I'm falling! - Again? - You better? - A little. Who's the killer this time? I don't know... I just started it. I don't like cemeteries. And it's so cold! Hey, Joana, where are you taking us? Are we going to your dad's grave? My dad isn't here. He died in Brazil. - I'm sorry, I didn't know. - I was little. C'mon, let's go! - Is it black magic? - No, it's a birthday party. This thing of yours is kind of depressing. It's not my "thing." What if we can't get a new passport in time? Do you understand what you've done? I don't want to go to your piece of shit country. - Don't say that! - Why? Don't they kill and torture people there? Now it's all "Copacabana Mon Amour," and your fucked up nostalgia. - It gets on my nerves! - All right, Joana! Come back here, Mom! Bia? Yes... Yeah, that's no problem... And do you know what the rent is? Really? No, that's great... Thank you, Bia. Give your brothers my best. Right? Bye. What? We're only going to have to pay the bills! That's great! - And it's near the beach! - How lovely! The beach, Mom? - You're not even from Rio... - So? Let me stay here! I could go to boarding school, like Louise's brother. Look... I can get a scholarship next year. In the meantime, I can just live with Nelly. - Ah, Joana! - Mom! Jojo... Come here. Listen... Who is it? It's the album "Transformer", by Lou Reed. Never heard it? Not bad. - Can I ask you a question? - Yes. Forget it. Something's up. Go on, spit it out. If it weren't for Mom... would you leave France for Brazil? Of course, obviously. Brazil is Latin America... - It's close to where I was born. - But Pinochet is over there! For now... But look what's happening in Brazil... - The military ended up giving in... - No, they're still in power! Yes, it's true. But the amnesty is a small victory. You're under arrest. I got you. He died. Oh, Leon... Careful! Where did you find that? Those aren't our things, don't touch them. Whose are they? Bia's mother, the owner of the apartment. What's her name? - I don't know. - Is it Fulana? Fulana isn't a person. "Fulana" is a word that means so-and-so. Got it? - Can you do like Tarzan? - Yes! Hi, Jojo! Did you sleep well? Time to get up. We're going on a sentimental tour, "by Ana". - Help! - Let's go! "Sentimental tourism"... only my dad could make up something that silly. Please, Jojo! I don't want to do this on my own. You're covered in jam. Careful, there might be snakes. Mom, if you see a snake, just freeze like this. - What? Like this? - I'll come and kill it! - You'll save me? - Yeah. What an adventure! Come, Paco! Paco, let's go! You okay? Careful. Water? Who wants water? I do! Don't you want some? Sandwich? Carefull! You're freezing. Mom, have we been here before? I don't think so. We lived far away, and it was dangerous for us to move around. I came when I first arrived in Rio. A promising doctor. But broke! If he ever gets filthy rich, it'll be with me... By his side, supporting him, not just living off his money! Got it? That's just the way I am... That's me! Janete. Dirt-poor, taking people's pictures at the nightclub. That's it, Marcos Mesquita! You know something? For you... For you I might even become a millionaire. Finally! Honey... Daddy's name is Thiago now... Thiago? Daddy Eduardo... Daddy Eduardo Thiago? What's Daddy's name? Thiago... In the wintertime, you... - I'm leaving... - Where are you going? - To the beach. - Wait, I want to go too! - To the beach? With who? - Tom and his friends. - Who's Tom? - The neighbor from 402. You shouldn't go out like that, Paco. They're going to teach me surfing. I can't miss that. You didn't let the adults know. Well, do you have the phone number for the airport? This was the same path Neruda went through. - How romantic! - Seriously, if it worked for him... Will you lend me your Walkman? - Come on, sweetie! - So I won't die of boredom. - Jo? - Ok. Grab it. Better like this... It looks good on you. You get bigger every day. Let's go. - Do I really have to go? - Yes, she's your grandma. - I don't even know her. - But she knows you. His books... this isn't all of them. He loved them. Eduardo cut class to go to the library, remember? It's true. He did love to read, that boy. Sometimes during lunch, he'd read with the book under the table. When I'd complain, he'd say, "Mom, I can't stop in the middle of a chapter." Your dad was so stuck-up, he was really something. Take it! You can have it! Look at this! It still works. Joana, honey, let's go. Get up, Jo! What happened? Thiago's down. What happened? Someone talked. - Who was it? - Daddy. And what'd he say? - He said he's not coming. - Really? A MIR meeting. MIR? I thought he was into the Workers? Party now. Now it's for me. How about a snack? - A snack? - Yes, let's go. Leon? Did you hear me? I don't like parties at the airport, mom. It's not a party at the airport today, Leon. Today the party is in a beautiful house, and there's even a swimming pool. - An Olympic-size pool? - No. It isn't an Olympic pool. Look at all the stuff I've got to do. You need to get out of this room. How about daddy? - Didn't your dad explain it to you? - Yeah. And what did he say? I forgot. He's got a very important meeting with MIR and the Sandinistas who are here today. Right? You understand, don't you, my little Trotsky. Meeting with Sandinistas... Of course he understands, mom. It's crystal clear for him! Are you going like that? Jo, it's really hot today. Paco! Your T-shirt. Of Duke Fleed He dreamed of our Earth The blue planet Whose light he saw From a hundred thousand leagues... It was like a vision. She was sitting in the middle of the bench, all alone, or at least he could not see anybody else in the dazzling light which her eyes cast upon him. Just as he passed her, she raised her head, he bowed automatically and... stopping a little way off, he looked at her. She was wearing a broad-brimmed straw hat? Do you want some? It's Coke... I don't drink Coke. - Your parents won't let you? - What do you mean? American imperialism, that kind of thing... - No... I just don't like it. - I get it. My name is Ernesto. What's yours? Joana. Have you been back long? - Two months, three weeks and one day. - And? - And what? - There you go, you've already adapted. - You sound like my mom. - Really? Yeah, you don't seem well adapted. I didn't say I was. Jojo! - Come on, play with me! - No, I don't want to. - Come on! - No! Look, Paco is calling you. Paco! Almost 15 years old. When I met you, you were a tiny little thing. They've probably already told you that your dad was a great singer. He was? When they brought Eduardo to DOPS, I was already detained there. He was there for ten days, but I never saw him. They isolated him. But we could hear him. Like... Oh wo-wo-woman, you've m-m-made a wreck of me And I'm so nervous it's ma-making me stut-stutter I can't tuh-tuh-take this cru-cruel longing, De-de-deprived of yo-your caress... You ga-ga-gave me your heart Th-then y-you t-t-took mine Y-y-you're a r-r-eal piece of work y-you'll wuh-wind up a hunchback Then one day we didn't hear him, and I found out he'd been taken away. Taken where? Didn't he die in jail? - No. - No? Over here! Joana! Come on, sweetie! Many people, when looking at Aleijadinho's life, thought that as a mestizo, he represented a blend between the white world and the black world. But others, looking at the social situation before us, see Aleijadinho as representing the fact that our society has a very great divide and that can't be easily overcome. What do you all think? All that's so far away now. But is it? Here's a question. It's true, it's in the past. But is it really that far away? Is it really that far from our own reality? Do you think it's a coincidence that everyone in class is white, and the maid who works in your house is black? We'll get back to this topic. Remember, these images reflect elements of Aleijadinho's life and times. And that's what we'll see on our trip to Ouro Preto. Will the rooms be coed? Is that all you can think of? This trip is going to be awesome. You've got to think of Aleijadinho, his life, and works. Before we go, on Monday, don't forget to bring your permission slips. No permission, no trip, ok? All right, see you next class. Ouro Preto is not all baroque art. There are hot hippie guys, too... Hi, Mom! - How was it? - Fine. Did you know we're going to Ouro Preto? - Really? - Yeah. That's great. It's beautiful there. - Have you been? - Yes. You're going to love it! I just need... Dad's death certificate for the permission form. And I need you to sign it. Eduardo doesn't have a death certificate. What? There's no death certificate. What do you mean? No body, no way to prove he's dead. So we don't have a certificate. What the hell? What do you mean, you can't prove it? That's the way it is, dear, but I'll talk to your teacher... But Mom... how can you be sure he's really dead if you didn't see it? If you don't even know how... - Joana, please... - No, answer me! Answer me for once. Roberto told me he didn't die in prison. In prison or not, what difference does it make? He's dead, dear. Where? What? Where is he buried, and why? What's happening to you, Joana? You know very well what a disappeared person is. No, I don't know. I don't know anything! Disappeared... Like a guy who goes out for cigarettes and never comes back. Who leaves his job, his family, everything! Did he do that? Did he do that? You don't understand anything. - We need to weigh the risks. - That's pure paralysis... Daddy... Daddy... Eduardo! Honey, open up for Daddy! Please, my love... Okay. I'll take bus 410, right? Okay. All right, Grandma. Okay. See you Saturday. Ok, bye! Leon, don't touch that! You going to see that half-grandmother again? There's no such thing as half-grandmothers. But yeah, I'm going to see my grandmother again. But you're my half-sister because we have the same mom. Yes. And Paco is my half-brother because we have the same father. That's right. And his mother's dead. No, his mother isn't dead, Leon. We've already told you. Paco's mother isn't dead. She's in Chile, you understand? But it's hard. Your dad isn't here because he died, right? So, if she's never here, it's because she's dead. No, that's not how it works. Do you think Paco misses his mom? Yeah, I think he does. Do you miss your dad? I don't know, I don't remember him very well. But... Were you already born when he died? Yes, I was already born. But when we grow up, we forget things. You understand? Impossible! It's normal, it happens to everyone. This is a complicated family, don't you think? Not so much. These three are attacked by bad astronauts and some military and UFO Robot Grendizer saves them. - Saves who? The bad astronauts? - No, these three. It's UFO Robot Grendizer versus the whole army of evil astronauts. And who wins? Here. Come! All this is just for us? Of course! It's not every day that I get a visit from my only granddaughter. These are Portuguese sweets. This is a "Nun's Belly". "Nun's belly"? Yes. Taste it, it's great. This one is "Bacon from Heaven". It's good, isn't it? Give me your glass. - How about your mom? - My mom died when I was one. Here are my aunts. Aunt Felicia, Aunt Gigi and Aunt Barbara. They came from Naples to help my dad out. They wound up raising me. Did you like them? Well, the one I really liked was Aunt Gigi. They were all very strict. The oldest, Aunt Felicia, was a real "dog sucking on a mango". What? You don't know the expression "a dog sucking on a mango"? No. Look at that sour face. This is the one I was looking for. Who is this Gerber baby here? What a doll! Look at that lovely little hand. I'm going to get you something. Just a minute. This is the only picture I have of your dad. He destroyed all the others. A safety measure, he'd say. But I managed to hide this one. Aren't you going to open it? - No. Not now. - All right. - You like music, don't you? - I love it! - And what type of music do you like? - Lots of kinds... But The Doors is my favorite band. I prefer Pink Floyd. Pink Floyd is wonderful. It's perfect after a day at work when I get home. It's so relaxing. I'd love to know how to blow smoke rings. Have you seen people doing it? - Can you do it? - No. - Can I try? - Do you smoke? - No, but can I try? - Of course. Let me see. Wow, nearly there! That fish-mouth is looking good. Almost... Come on, Jo! Come on. Come in. - Want to read? - No. Is São Paulo far? São Paulo? Kinda. About six hours by car. Daddy will come for your birthday. He'll cook that barbecue you love! Little white horse Take me away Take me to the town Where I was born I have, I have, I have You have nothing I have three sheep In a cabin One gives me milk Another gives me wool... Focus and power of absorption are essential requirements for any surfer aiming for their best performance. Power of absorption? Mom? Hello! How are you? Today? Joana! - Hi! - Hi! - How are you? - Fine... How about you? I'm good. Have you adapted now? - Are you also a child of the exiles? - Exiles? - Yes. - Yes, I am. Why? You don't look it. Nadia, we don't have blinking neon signs on our foreheads. You do, paleface. I'm sick of the dictatorship of tanning lotion. I agree. "Vive la difference!" Boy from Rio Stop! So hot you make me shiver... What do you like to listen to? Ah, whatever. - Whatever? - I like rock. - The Doors. - I can see that. How about David Bowie? Cool. I don't know much about rock. I know a few sambas. Do you know this one? I've been feeling a little awkward for a while Concerned about that boy Who never leaves your side, damn it Always at the right place at the wrong time I'm sick and tired of seeing that boy by your side Joana... I love that name. Ernesto... - It's because of Che Guevara, right? - No, it's my grandpa's name. - Jeez... It's cold. - Yeah. Stop. Look at you. All covered in sand. Jo, I need your help. Which one do you prefer? It depends... What's the job this time? It's for a very formal law firm. The grey one, then. You look lovely in that color. - Should I tuck it in? - Yeah. And the master's, Mom? How's it going? I'm late... - What time is it? - Eight o'clock. - Eight? - Yeah. Jo, you'll have to fix your brother breakfast. As usual... Give him some fruit, ok? Oh, and his school shirt is in the laundry room. But remember when I wanted to talk about Leon, and you didn't have time... Hello. Hi! I'm fine, and you? Yes. Got it. We'll talk later, ok? I have to go now. Ok. Bye. What were you saying about Leon? When is Luis coming back? He'll be in São Paulo for a while. - Are we moving to São Paulo? - No. Are you guys going to split up? No. When you gave me the little rosebud... And like this? Is it ok like this? This way is okay? It's ridiculous that they won't let you go to Ouro Preto because of a piece of paper. It's not their fault. It's the law. When it's convenient for them, it's the law. When you were born, I lit a candle there. I was so happy... I wanted to baptize you. I even had an argument with your dad because of it. I was just like that girl. Don't you believe in God anymore? That's been over for a while. So why do you come here? Because it's cool in here. Even during summertime. And since you can't eat in here. It's really nice at lunchtime. It's kinda Zen... Grandma... You're such a character! What if the priest caught us eating in here? Your dad hated all this. One day he came from catechism class, just a wee little thing, he said he'd thought long and hard and that for him, personally, he preferred Tarzan to Jesus Christ. Tarzan, that dummy, not Zorro, the Avenger... - Grandma... - What? How can we be sure that he's dead? I don't have class, but I'll pick you up, okay? Okay. Okay, I promise. Good night, Leonzito. Here... What a pest. I'll turn this off and it'll find its way out. Here. Here are the names of all the people that I went to talk to when your dad went to prison. Collaborators, meetings, churches, the minutes, it's all here. - Did you find anything? - Not much. So you talked to all those people for nothing? Hardly. Lots of this information helped other families of the missing. All these mothers, we've helped each other a lot. Grandma... Do you think that someday we'll know for sure? We just have to keep on searching and fighting for the state to recognize its crime. ARMY SHUTS DOWN SUBVERSIVE HIDEOUT Where's Lili? Come on, Jo! Stop moving! I want some water. Thiago, the guy came out with a gun and started firing, it couldn't be avoided. - Is the car clean? - Yes - Is my bag there? - No, I took it out. My Bonnie... More to the left, not to the right! More to the left. A little lower. More... That's okay! Good! There's never this kind of party in France. No, Paco! What a pain! It isn't time to eat! You're a pro, huh? Luis who taught me. Ah, he's Argentinian. I thought he was Chilean. The Argentineans don't have a monopoly on barbecue. I missed you. Take the sweets to the dining room table. What a beautiful party! - Hi. - You did it all? Hi, Mom. Lucas' mom is bringing Leon and five friends in his father's van. Great! How about Luis? Luis called and said that he'll try to make it. Try to make it, Mom? - Yes. - He promised Leon. He has a MIR meeting. You know what that's like. They're only here for a few days. - I'll come back here on my own. - That's dangerous, isn't it? Dangerous... What's dangerous is you staying here with Joana. Happy Birthday to you - Long live, Leon! - Everything or nothing for him? - Everything! - So what do we say? It's big, big, big It's time, time, time There we go Leon! Leon! Leon! Ass kisser... No? Let's smoke! What about your mom? Can you put it over there? I unremember uncertainly I don't know who lived my past life If it was me it is confusedly unremembered and so it flows, trapped within me I don't know who I was, nor who I am I know nothing of that All there is of mine is what sees me now The green field, natural and speechless For there hazily stirs a wind I cannot see I am so still within myself that I feel nothing of it. I look And where the valley rises to the hillsides I am so still within myself that I feel nothing of it I look And where the valley rises to the hillsides There goes my gaze, following my instinct As one might gaze upon a set table This suitcase will attract less attention. Easy! Stop. You'll wake the children. What are the odds that you'll survive? Tell me! - 0%? - Don't say that! - 5%? 10%? - Stop it! I'm not going to die! We've all said that, haven't we? There's no other option! There always is. There always is. I'd like you to come with me. What'll we do with the kids? Send them to Cuba? What are you doing here? I peed... That's okay, come here. Paco, she's going to tell us a "true" story. Come. It was September of 1973, in Santiago. It was a beautiful day. We were playing cops and robbers. I was the cop and Paco the robber because he was already very fast. While Luis listens to the radio talking about the coup, Ana is packing the bags. Son, get in. Joana, come in. Mercedez, Paco's mother, hands Paco's passport to Luis. Paco is sleeping and doesn't say goodbye. Mercedez... Her beautiful face. - Thanks, son. Cheers! - Cheers! Want some pie? Yeah, a little slice. Let's taste Jojo's cake. Really good! I loved it. What a mess! You didn't clean anything up. - I'm going out. - Ok. - See you soon? - Yes, son. - Bye. Take care. - Bye. Love you, bye. Jo? Ana told me that the party was great. And that someone called Ernesto helped you with the barbecue. Might I know who that young man is? You'd have never done that in Paris. Hey, Jojo. Look! If I could, I'd stay here with you. Please, don't doubt that. So why are you leaving? I have to spend more time in São Paulo... São Paulo? I thought you were going to Chile. Yes, but I can't talk about it now. - I'll explain it to you later... - When? You're never here. Listen, Jojo... We've had some important victories here in Latin America. Here in Brazil, in Nicaragua with the Sandinistas... And why do you speak of victory? What were your victories, after all? Do you think Leon waking up every night is a victory? - He's wetting the bed, you know? - No, I didn't. Is it a victory for you that mommy has to wear those stupid heels all day every day? Is it a victory for you that Paco can't even see his own mother? - Take it down a notch, Joana. - No! And where have you been? Fighting your little revolutions in Nicaragua or El Salvador? You know what? Fuck the class struggle and fuck the revolution! And you aren't sending me to Cuba! Bravo! Shut the fuck up, you stupid fascist! Go to Cuba! Let's calm down? Are you better? Hey, Jo... I can't stay here and do nothing. Understand? I have to return to Chile and continue the struggle. But how? - Underground? - Yes. Of course. It's all very well organized. We have a good structure behind us. I'm not alone, Jo... The risk is minimal. Really. Daddy Eduardo Thiago? Want more? Are you hungry? What's the matter? Does your mom know you're here? Want me to tell her? Sure you don't want anything else to eat? No, Grandma. It's all right. Not even a tiny spoon of dulce de leche? You're trying to make me obese! Well, give me a good-night kiss, then. Good night, my dear. What? You know that house? The house in the picture in the paper? What picture? There was a picture in the folder you gave me. What about the picture? There's a doll in it. Lili. - What Lili? - My doll. I'll show you. Here. That's the house. I was there, I'm sure of it. And here is my doll Lili on the ground. My God, are you sure? Yes. You need to talk to your mother about this, Joana. My mom never wants to talk. It's so difficult to talk about these things. Can I sleep with you? Of course! Just make yourself comfortable. - Good night. - Good night, darling. Joana, we need to talk. Sit here. Are you smoking pot? Really? That's what you want to talk about now? Answer me. - Once in a while. - What do you mean? I don't know, Mom. On weekends, at the beach... - At the beach? - Yes, like everybody else does, Mom! Do you know you can be arrested? And put in reform school? You're making such a big deal over a joint! Big deal, Joana? - Your friends smoke, too. - My friends are adults. They can smoke, drink, even kill themselves if they want to! But not you! You are my problem, Joana! Problem? Yes, you're my problem, I don't want you smoking, and I don't have to explain that. You never have any explanations anyway! And "your problem" is telling you to fuck off! What happened? Thiago's down. What's Daddy's name? What happened? Let's make Lili fly? I can't believe it! I was worried about you. I was looking for Ernesto's number... - Leon showed me... - Mom, get out! - Joana, in the bus... - Mom, get out! Thanks, Leon! Joana... On the bus... On the way to Santa Cruz... You wore that dress you liked, with the flowers, remember? What bus, mom? I was wearing that blue dress, I had puked on it. No... You changed clothes. You put on the one with the flowers, remember? You were wearing it when we got to Cochabamba. I remember the train and the blue dress, that's it. Joana... We never took the train. There weren't any seats left, so we took a bus... that was full of chickens in the corridor. You thought that was funny. I would never have left you alone on a train, Jojo. What about this, mom? I didn't make this up. I thought you were sleeping. Was that the house where Dad got caught? But you weren't there. Neither was I. How did they find him, Mom? Nobody knows. It was me... You know it was me. What are you talking about, Joana? I yelled... "Eduardo!" I knew I shouldn't say his name... No, sweetie. That doesn't make any sense. I didn't mean to say his name, Mom, I'm sorry! That's nonsense, Joana. Listen to me. You have nothing to do with this. They found him because someone talked about the house. Not about him. The person thought the house was empty, and they were tortured until they caved. They didn't even know your father, sweetie. In the wintertime, you... In my eyes you read... You look at me From up close, you look at me Closer and closer and then we play cyclops We look closer and closer at one another, and our eyes get larger They come closer, they merge into one And the two cyclopes look at each other, blending as they breathe... Here. Are they yours? Kiss. Thanks, little Trotsky. C'mon, sing! Thanks. - Sing with us, Joana. - I don't know the words. UNREMEMBER
