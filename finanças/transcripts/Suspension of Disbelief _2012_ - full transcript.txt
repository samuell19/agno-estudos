I wrote the screenplay for the film. And there was a casting for the main roles... And Sarah thought to be my daughter would be a problem. Why? - She thought and probably she had so right... If everyone knew, that I am her father, and she would get the role that then everyone else would think she would get the role because of me . Because of my relationships. - J. I understand That's a problem.. And? What has she done? She used a false name donning a wig on and went so to audition. Really? You pretended to be someone else? I like that. And further - you got the role?. You know damn well what she wants and what she does not want.. A very wonderful story. And Sarah's mother Are you divorced? This is a bit complicated - sorry. You do not need to apologize... She has disappeared. 15 years ago we understood each not particularly .. And one day she left the house and never came back. Where is she now? I do not know.

Would be possible Is that important? Can I tell you something? I want to tell you some about my sister and me But of course. I'm all ears. Our birthplace is a small town named Bar-Le-Duc, near Nancy. When we were eight, our parents were killed in a car accident. It was not so bad We lived quite close to each other And it was a fairly small town. How is this so times now, everyone knows each other up. My foster parents were very nice and pleasant people. They gave me a lot of love and security. My sister however... Something terrible has happened... She said she had been abused by her father . It was a scandal The police investigated the case.. In such a small town as that .. My stepfather killed himself. But he has really abused? My foster parents had pity on her and opted to to let them live with us. I was so happy to be back with my sister together. For a while we had a wonderful time We were like a real family and Angelique and I are every day went to school together. But then... ... the whole drama has repeated. They accused my stepfather experiment of it... you know. But I knew it was a lie. In truth it was the other way around. She had tried to seduce him This was a terrible situation, because I... When the police her interrogation with me led I had to make a decision. To cover My sister and I?gen or to say the truth and to save an innocent man. How did you decide? I have told the police the truth and asked her not to reveal it Angelique. But of course... she eventually figured it out. It was put in a special facility. For difficult children. And I pretended it did not exist. I acted as if nothing had happen next. What is it? Does the camera still? I want you to get up then And the very dramatic!

She was brilliant in it, yourself as someone else to spend. And sometimes they pretended to be me. And they are all fell for it. And I then got the trouble for something they had done. And you? Did you even do that? I felt the always very difficult to I?gen. What do you mean? That's the point in acting but Or not? To I?gen. Yes, already possible In a way, yes. How did you find they actually My sister?. You sure an impression of her won, right? You have yet spoken to her. The policeman told me that. I said 'hello' to her. You never felt attracted to men at her age, Little boys. So they called them. You felt more attracted to considerably older men. Men with power. I can well imagine as they chatted with you. And I can well imagine that they found you very attractive. And they gladly wanted to seduce. I could as often as you watch it. Tell already Have you flirted with her? Did she dressed? Have you fucked her? Bloody hell! Shit. - What - No power out here. We should return to the village run Is only about a mile. I'm sorry. Asshole. How long does it take to get drowned? I have no idea. You could not swim. Come on, let's go. Since no one answers it, Sir And the next taxi rank at the station.. I'm afraid, have already Feierabend How beautiful. However, thank you. You have room? How many do you need - Two, please?. Two unfortunately we did not Just one more thing. No, dear, we're fine. Only the car must be pulled out of the ditch. We were lucky that near a pub was Do not worry. How is Therese? Everything is fine, I think she's already asleep. Okay. Since I'm happy. Daddy, the police were here tonight They wanted to have a few of my photos I hope the hot order.? Course. Why do you ask? Well, on one of them you smoke a joint. Do not worry. I think now have to solve other problems. So then. See you tomorrow. How about when turning today? Sarah? Sarah! - Dad? Hello? Hey, let that! We should perhaps prefer to go down again. Why? He comes back but not until tomorrow. Daddys little treasure. Say it! Daddys little treasure. - Lauter. Daddys little treasure. It's all good. ? Calm down... Martin Jones - Yes, that's me. Good morning, sir. My colleague and I would us like to talk with you. Hello, Miss Can we go into the house - Yes, of course?. Come. Well, what a coincidence... I do not know what you mean. Young woman last seen in this house, found dead in a canal. Almost to the day 15 years after your wife disappears. Last seen in this house. Do I need a lawyer? This should be a joke - Yes, of course. "Fiona and I had an argument, she left the house and did not return." And since that day? Nothing at all? Not the smallest message. The body was never found. Because everything is so safe there. I'm just doing my job, sir This may not be a surprise for you.. It's nothing personal. you understand - Of course I understand that Were you in the night in which she disappeared sexual intercourse with her? I am referring on the young lady from France. No. I did not have sex with this young French lady. They went to bed early at about two clock. . True - And the party was still going on there? Oh yes. - And you saw for the last time before you leave the party? True. Bullock was there on the day, when he had his heart attack. This is correct - What did he want from you.? He had a script written and I should judge it. I read it. And he wanted to know my opinion. 'Young Woman. Very provocative. In the room. " What could this mean I advised him to bring a bit more sex with the game Order a bit to heat up the whole thing And that was all Why do not you ask him Bullock died yesterday, Sir I'm sorry to hear that Back to the conversation, . they led with the young lady How would you describe this meeting What do you mean - Did you feel that she wanted to flirt with you No, not at all?. The reason for my question is but that this looks very familiar... But pictures can sometimes be misleading. What's this? For a cigarette A RYO - So you're smoking.? From time to time. I think that's enough for me Thank you for your time.. You have nothing against a DNA test, right? No, nothing at all. Further, there were hematoma at the neck and the inside of the thighs. The victim had traces of cocaine and marijuana in the blood. The victim was not wearing any underwear, but there are photographic evidence that she has worn in the hours before her death underwear. A robbery is excluded. The bag of the victim was found in the water. It is known that the victim knew the locations. It was a possible route to the residence of their friend in which she lived at the time. We can assume that the young woman fell into the canal, while under the influence of drugs and was by her sister, we know that they unfortunately could not swim. Due the present investigation results the court decides that it is to "accidental death by drowning" is. The body can now be released. Thank you.

The first part of your story is true. You were orphans, yes. But the rest was a lie. The need to just tell you! You think you so incessantly just any stories! Do you want to hear the real story? We were adopted together. She was the practical wife and he was the friendly farmer. And for a few months we were more or less happy, Angelique and me. And then began the nightly visits. You know what I mean, Martin? We were suddenly realized that we had to watch that because no one else was there, it would do. And there was none that we could trust And then he had a tragic accident. Yes, I know. Have you killed him? Men who find little girls often find a dirty end. Do you think about the wrong -: no. - But this I should hope so! Finally, I do not blame you before that you your wife you killed, right? - What? If you have not actually killed you sure thought countless times about it! No recriminations Let us keep to the facts! What did you still Great found? After the terrible accident one has separated you and put in different homes. But you were both completely distraught and totally upset! What you told me of for good twin, bad twin... That was fiction. Not bad. Really, not bad. That was really good detective work. Yes, they tried to break us apart. But we have constantly tricked. I've visited visited me We have swapped places! You I was. I was it. We were one and the same person namely the time! Had the same taste Did any thought of the other.. ? Every thought - By moment I met you, I knew that they try! had to seduce you, I would have tried. I know everything about you two, Martin And yet you thought, I would have killed - Well, it was not possible. Also you have a dark side. My heart is broken, Martin. Do you understand that? I thank you for everything, Martin. Take good care of yourself. Angelique and I, we really like you very much. We are really similar. I know. Twins. Right? I did not mean it and me. I meant you and me! Farewell, Martin! That's simply not You can not let all hang! These are our ideas Why should we risk because That the audience draws the wrong conclusions? Lead them to your way of thought and bring it then the end! - No! This gives the audience but only the freedom the story to take home And to imagine... - Are not you afraid that you could interpret as laziness? What will happen you have come up with an end? Such questions plane Obviously you have done it. But... - If one gives you no end you have to interpret it yourself. This makes the film only to your own... - Producer! The film makes a He has an interpretation.! And he's hammering the people still such a they do not understand it so, How was he thinking's You can do it just as well but leave open! Life brought us now times no happy ending. There are happy interludes. And that again follow the little less happy interludes. I'm here for you, if you need me.
