Good day. Welcome to you folks from Soul Jazz, It gives me great pleasure to see you visiting Studio One, pioneer leader of Jamaican music, I'm going to take you inside, so you can see all around and see where it all began. Clement Dodd and Studio One Music, that is so accepted in the world today, which we are all thankfuI for. There he is. I'm Johnny Moore. They call me Dizzy, Dizzy Johnny. I'm Leonard Dillon, leader from the group The Ethiopians. I'm Lincoln Sugar Minott, Youth Promotion, Black Roots Productions, singer, songwriter, producer, the whole works, coming out originally from studio of Studio One. Welcome One Love and Unity. Hi, this is Ken Boothe and I'm from Kingston, Jamaica, singer and entertainer. Yes, I'm yours truly, Alton Ellis and here for your interview. Jeans was in, the dungaree, you know everybody... But for this climate down here, suits wasn't the right thing. Well, I'm Clement Dodd, better known as Sir Coxsone Downbeat, Master of the RoyaI Society of Jazz, and the King of Soundsystem. Undoubtedly Studio One produces the majority of the best music coming out of Jamaica. The backyard DJ adds his own speciaI flavour as he turns down the vocal track and does his own vocal rhyme schemes. The first time I went to Studio One... You know the first time you go to the studio, you wait your time, right? And I would take a peep in just to see, and they would shout "Get out!" They didn't want me to see them. When we had a session, I didn't really sit down much, I was always dancing. They called me the dancing operator. Everything was going like 24 hour, recording, voicing, cooking, singing, about six pressing plants inside, just going like... all day. Where were you born and brought up? Born in Kingston and brought up in Kingston, basically from Orange Street to East Street When you were growing up was there music in the house? Well, yes, we had... a Morphy Richards radio and we used to listen to the foreign station a lot. Like Voice of America, listening to people like... Billy Eckstine, Sarah Vaughan, LioneI Hampton, Louis Jordan. What did your mum do? She had like a grocery store and I was quite busy there helping, when I get home from work, because at that time I was a mechanic. So I get off work 4:00. By 5:30, we'd be playing music. And people would expect that and come from other parts of the city, sit outside and enjoy the music. Buy a lot of beer and stuff like that. When did you first start playing in the store? ln the late forties, early fifties. How old were you then? Well, it would take quite a bit of calculation to figure that! There was Tom the Great Sebastian. He had a soundsystem and I used to go by weekends and listen. He was playing rhythm and blues too, he was playing a lot of Wyoming Harris and stuff like that. When I first met Mr Dodd through a DJ that he had by the name of Count Machuki, who was the first Disc Jockey in Jamaica at that time, - Was he speaking? - No. The speaking wasn't really in, in Jamaica at that time. I came back and changed that. With a lot of toasting, you know. - Did you get that idea from America? - America, right. Then I got together with Count Machuki and would just toast to him like l'd heard on the radio station. Well, you know, Coxsone wasn't the first soundsystem, but Coxsone's soundsystem was the first soundsystem to create disc jockeys that'd use the microphone in between records. All the other DJs before our time would just put on a record and either dance with a girl, or drink a beer, but it wasn't anything exciting. Count Machuki and myself, we are the two person that started this mic business. The way they rap, you felt involved cos' it sound like they're rapping specially to you. And this is the stuff we came back to Jamaica with. Our sound took off because my sound was the only sound that was doing stuff like that. ln the earlies, well, this ackee tree was much smaller. And there was a big black mango tree right there. ln that corner. - Could you eat them? - What?! God used to ripe those mangos every second! Because if a 100 artists is in this yard and every man that climb he couldn't find no more than two. When you find two you will never find another one. And if someone else climbs he'll find two. And you can't find another one. lt's like our joke here. Everyone fed off this mango tree. So where did you get the idea to go to America? Well, in the early days it was a popular thing. They were recruiting men for Florida, to either work in fruit or vegetable, or the sugar cane. That was like an early means of making some good money. - Was everyone Jamaican? - Yeah, yeah, all Jamaican. Did you mix with the Americans? Well, at work we mixed with them. And on weekends, when you go partying, we mixed a lot with the American. Would the parties be in town? Yeah, you would say in town. It would be jukeboxes, when we go to like live shows, then its different, then it would be a band. Cos' you didn't have soundsystems in America at that time, just the jukeboxes. While I was there, I sent the amplifier along with a lot of records. So you knew that was what you were going to do? Yes. And I sent a diagram on how I liked the box to be built. My old lady got involved. She sorted out the boxes and she just started! As a matter of fact, she was the very first female DJ in Jamaica. Yes, I could get ideas from some of the jukeboxes, you know, to build these boxes with a lot of glass and fancy stuff, and writing on it. When the power of the amplifier was much less, it wasn't strong enough to break the glass, so we went for beauty, - So they were made out of glass? - Yes, certain spots. The drums were over on that side right there. The horns would be there and vocals would be somewhere. Well, yes, this microphone was Bob Marley's famous microphone and up to now you can't go no higher in studio microphones. This is top of the line. Cedric Brooks, Cedric or Roland or Tommy. Why was he separate then? He used to play what the guitar was to play, ska ska. That's why we call him Ska Campbell. I notice, while working generally, coming from the back of a speaker there usually is a softer heavier sound of the bass, so I created a bass box where I put a aperture at the back, and put a mic at the back, not at the front of the speaker but at the back. I came back, fresh ideas, big boxes, attended the popular soundsystem of the day, see what they were doing and... Duke Reid was a friend of the family. I had the records, so I used to go round play them on his soundsystem, so as to see how the dance fans would accept it. - On his soundsystem? - On his soundsystem. This was doing a lot for him as I was playing records he didn't even know. There was many soundsystem in those days, soundsystem had just begun. Because orchestra had start to fade out around 1952, all the orchestras start to leave Jamaica and make their base in England. So do you think he knew that you were training to start... competition? Well, maybe but he wouldn't really figure me much competition cos' he's a much bigger person and in the business well established. There was another man around who was Duke Reid the Trojan and the contest used to be between Duke Reid and Sir Coxsone's Downbeat at all time. I got a job at Bacha Melon and I think this is where I really hit it strong. I put the two of them together as a double sound for one night. Duke Reid and Coxsone. The booking was between me and Duke, well Duke was the senior sound so he pulled the crowd. Himself, Count Machuki was the disc jockey. And myself were at that dance. Monitoring the sound. Duke opened the dance. And I would come on about 12 o'clock in the night and surprisingly we upset the whole thing. Cos' they figure that I was the man of the evening. This was around 1954, 55. - Was that exciting? - Very exciting cos' Duke Reid himself was really a big sound, too. Being a young sound at that time, they thought maybe I was able to play two hours, but after they see how I held the crowd, they just sent Duke home and let me play for the rest of the night. Coxsone grew up with we. Duke Reid was a ex-policeman. So because of that I think the crowd would follow Coxsone more, and Duke Reid used to have a good following. But the regular boys, as I would call it, the corner boys on the street came to Coxsone, because we are all coming through the same tracks. What we thought of playing, if you started playing songs that no one had heard of before, and they started moving to it, to keep them in that groove, you play another good song that they're familiar with, to keep that groove going. You might hit them with a new song, but you have to make certain that it's something good enough that could keep them going. Well, my name is Winston Sparks, aka King Stitt. I was born in Kingston, 1940. Jackie heard a guy who sing, and Jackie said "That's E Sharp, you know." And Roland said "Yes?" And Roland picked up his horn like that and finds that it's E Sharp. "You're going to be a great musician!" Well my name's Lascelles Perkins, born Jamaica, Kingstonian. There was something about Lee Perry that mystified, to this day, he's a mysticaI individual. ln those days in Jamaica, if you don't break that Downbeat Barrier, it's like you're not reaching nowhere. You have Duke Reid fan touting for him. You have my fan touting for me, then if there is a third sound you have fans from there. - So it's organized to be a clash? - Yeah, that's right. We'd clash. And then sometime those clashes were for each person. But if you're not really playing that suitable for the people, people don't want it. So would you each have your own soundsystem? Each have our own soundsystem. - One at one end and the other. - Yes And sometimes we're like about here, because although this may be like the platform, my sound, the other person sound, the other person there, but the speaker box is spread all over, so as to cover the dance hall properly you'd have three of us in this corner here. We have a box each, there it goes, so when it switch from one to the other you don't hear much difference, because the box is here. But if one sounds better than the other, it's quite clear Kings Lawn could accommodate, at least, probably... more than 4000 people. - 4000? - Yes! Kings Lawn. Really big. It takes up one block. It takes up from Church St to Love Lane. The height of the sound clash was when we started making local recording. Because at that time you could have more songs than your competitor and better songs if your recording was good. That excel you to the top. To keep the identity from the folks we used to scratch the label, not only the label, also the names. Where did you get that idea? I wonder where, but I wasn't the only person who did it! Everybody who had a good record that was popular they used to erase the name and also the label, cos' sometimes you would be able to track the record because you know what label it's on. Because of erasing the song you had to really give it a name. So you had songs like Coxsone's Hop, Downbeat Shuffle and stuff like that. So how long did you have, say, Coxsone's Hop? How long did you own it before someone else had it? Coxsone's Hop? I don't think anybody ever got around to that! Yes! ln America the Rhythm and Blues was kinda fading, dying out, then came the Rock and Roll. But Rock and Roll didn't go over strongly in Jamaica. So about that time we realize that we really make some music of our own, to keep the people happy. I went in the studio and start recording. And the first couple of times I went in, we did a little calypso there, a little tango and we did some Rhythm and Blues. We try to copy the rhythm and blues with that driving beat, and after a couple of sessions we see how the people like it, we felt that you were on a good track. He was doing recording at that time for his sound. Not for publication, because like dub plates. Because all of the other sounds used to go to America and buy the same sounds that he went and bought 2 weeks ago or 3 weeks ago. So he couldn't stay ahead of them playing his own thing. So he started recording his own thing to play on his sound. We did reference discs which is now called dub plates. And you would make your reference disc and you'd come to your party and you'd find out that the people out there love it so bad, so if you have more than one set system, because at one time I had 5, so I would have to cut 5 dub off of that specific record. When we started we didn't have an idea this could be a business, these records were saleable. We knew it was suitable and we was trying to satisfy our dance fans. But we didn't have a clue that these could really work out into something saleable. So, do you remember the musicians you picked first of all? Yes, I started early with Clue J, and Roland Alphonso, Johnny Moore, Jah Jerry. Quite a few... We were playing so much free party and the word was getting around that is Jonathan from off the corner who is singing this song. Did the musicians come to the party to hear it? Yes, Roland never miss a party, he is always there. Even the vocalist, if he has something that is current and moving, he has to be seen, show himself. And in the dance hall now, you see them talking about dance hall? Dancehall was long ago. I had to go to the dancehall to hear the dub. Cos when I did that song "You're no good" I asked him which dance he's going to take it tonight, because he had three sets, number 1 , number 2 and number 3. And he told me that he was going to take it to Forrester's Hall and I could meet him up there. And I went there and the first night I didn't hear it. Because when Machuki, he's the selector, he selects how he feels. So I was there the whole night and I don't hear my song. And then l'd go back another night and I hear "You're No Good" and everybody dancing. You know. One of the early records that we released was Easy Snapping and that was... about a year and a half... 2 years after it was recorded, but it was so strong and people was saying "Downbeat, why don't you make a record of that?" And l'd say, "You think it would sell?" and they say "Yeah, man!" So we give it a try. And that was the start of the business. Then we figure it could be a business because records like that sold a lot. The island is JA, Jamaica, the north coast has a steel band or two and enough calypso, to make your Arthur Murray money well spent, on a honeymoon in Ocho Rios. But chances are you'll miss the real pulse of this island, the reaI sound. Though it can be heard a few steps from Dunn's River Falls, just a 24-inch speaker away from a Jamaican Hill. But it isn't yet a part of the modified American plan. So you'll fly home humming "Welcome to Jamaica where the rum comes from" without having heard one skank guitar chord, not one bulldozing bass rift, not one wailing lyric of JA's heartbeat: REGGAE. Welcome to Jamaica, where the reggae comes from. Well I think I started at Brentford Road in about '61 . Was that a big step? Well, yes, of course, because we could spend more time putting the sounds together, so you could make a perfect record. When you hire studio you're kind of watching the clock on the wall and sometimes you accept a take just because time is running out. When you have your own studio, then you try to get perfection and you stick to that. At that time I was the only person in Jamaica that was recording steadily with an in-house band. Did they receive a wage for the week or as a session musician? No, once we got things going and were certain of ourselves then we started a weekly arrangement with the band. They would play from Monday to Friday, say 10 to about 4, 10 to 5, around that time, and that was a weekly thing we had going. - Did people like that arrangement? - Yeah, man, they loved it. You see, why that went over strongly was that the only place hiring musicians steadily for the week was the hotels. And what they was making here they was happier recording here because the hotels wouldn't pay that kind of money. But also it was more interesting music. Yes, because the hoteI would stick to the calypso and little ballad here and there. Here they never know what they were going to end up playing. How often did you work? Well, work was like a daily situation and everybody looked forward to it, and we were enjoying what we were doing. When we got started the bass player, Clue J, he was more or less the upfront person, when we were coming to record he would say "Everybody has their line." That is to say that everybody has to be mentally prepared to do their job, because everybody's getting paid so everybody's got to have an input. It's not that you're getting $10 to arrange and I'm going to get $5 to play, Everybody's getting the same, so everybody has got to have an input. When we was playing the boogie woogie and the shuffle and things like that we realize that we were definitely copying the American stuff. But after playing and experimenting along the way we realized we could do something on our own and just for that difference this is why we decide to really come up with and stick to the Ska. And you thought you wanted to make something Jamaican? Some true Jamaican sound. Out of Ska came Skatalites, because we were in the studio here, and after we experimented and got it over, it was the men inside here that was doing most of the Ska. So we just gave them the name The Skatalites, just to identify that they were definitely playing Ska. We decided on drafting in some of the people playing in the studio. Those who we feel could put a very dynamic group together. So we did that. We called on McCook, Alphonso, as outsiders and Jah Jerry. Did you release records by them straight away? Yes, when Skatalites came about it had developed into a record business, in the early stage when we were recording people like Clue J we thought this was only for our soundsystem, and the dances. So after releasing a couple and realize it was so successful, we realize everything now. Did you think of yourself as a Ska band or a jazz band or a Jamaican? It was Skatalites, it was a Ska band. We played other music. Sometimes we play a waltz or two or one of the American pop things, but our basic aim was to propagate Ska. You did seem to record a lot of materiaI very quickly. Yes, because they were the cream of the musicians available, because after you have Roland and you have Tommy, then you have the two best horn man there. Tenor. Johnny was very good, not to mention Don Drummond. I always heard mention Don Drummond leading the group. Is that not? Well, he was so popular that some people figure that he was the leader, but it was really Tommy. But when it come to sessions now, Don would come to the session with his own compositions, you understand, even more than the rest of the guys. What we did were like backing vocals, we had vocalists who came in and we'd put the music together for the vocalist. They'd come with a set of lyrics and probably a melody sometimes but it was the arrangement. The musicians generally put it together. Was the singer in the room when you recorded? Yes! It's not like now where you lay a rhythm. Everybody had to work, cos' the mic's were limited and I guess the tracks were limited too. Yes, well, where you get the melancholy from is the Don Drummond's writing. He has that sound. You know. - Is that to do with how he felt? - Well, yes, he was like that. - And did you like that? - Yes, we loved that, because is like the wind instrument, kind of laid back, and then the rhythm is pumping. It's like the horn is laid back and the rhythm section is pumping. So it just gave you that double feeling. It was good! We did a lot of songs. We did some before we were named Skatalites, and Skatalites lasted about a year. And we did a lot of songs in that year, because it was actually everyday we were in the studio and it's like a days work, 9-5 , and we come in, no set time to come off and say "That's it, I've had enough for the day." Come on in. You're welcome to the Success Club. This is where we had all of the good vibes going, In 1960, '61 , '62. Right here was the good old Success Club. This is where we had the good Monday night dances with Count Ossie, Sir Coxsone Downbeat, we had a lot clash here too, Dance Clash, Duke Reid, Sir Coxsone, Lord Koos. But it was all fun, all fun! Those were the days! Come here, let me introduce some of the great old fans! This was a great old fan of ours in the 1960s. All these men! Really good! Success Club Kingston. - Did he have the best soundsystem? - Number one, man! When you were DJing where was the sound? Why was Coxsone's the best soundsystem? The best music. Him have the best artists. - All the top artists - All the great artists. ln the early days Success was the main fun place. Success was the best. We're going up here for a little soda. This was a regular place. All through the night people came in here also. Loud, so it travelled. People far away hear the sound and track it and come here. Sometimes you have a dance here and in front you have the Mutual Hall. It is who is playing the best music. - Did you like the competition? - Competition all the way. I had a lot of respect for Duke because... he is ahead of us. And the friendship went back. My parents knew him. The competition was just like when you're in the dancehall. But when you meet together as men you try to be cool and alright. It was very diplomatic between the both of them. Because Duke, Coxsone always treat him with this respect. Duke is an older man than Coxsone, Coxsone always treat him with this respect. "Hello Mr Reid." But when he turned his back, he used to say "I'm going to damage him musically!" So it was just this thing going on between them and Mr Reid is a man... who always had this gun at his side, and have this grumpy face. Duke Reid had a liquor store. The liquor store is downstairs, and the studio is upstairs. But he has a speaker box wired to the liquor store so whatever's going on upstairs he can hear it. And if what he hear he don't like, he's coming upstairs with all those guns. In regards to Treasure lsle and Studio One. Studio One had that street sound. If you hear it, with all the mistakes you like everything about it. It have that catching sound. You know, with Jackie Mittoo behind it. And Jackie Mittoo feel. And that is what I mean. Duke's tunes stiff and straight and to the point, and no leaning to this way and that way, and that's the difference in the recording. I can remember on one occasion I was sitting in the studio and he normally have Tommy McCook and this saxophone player called Marquis, Herman Marquis. Everybody was mixing... Tommy and Marquis would be there. One day they were mixing a song and Duke Reid was sitting down and observing what was going down. He heard something that we didn't hear. And he asked Errol to stop the tape and he look on us and say "Didn't you hear that?" So I said no. And he look at Marquis and say "Didn't you hear that?" And Marquis say no. And he say "Run the tape again." And when Errol play back the tape we still couldn't pinpoint what he was talking about Where I was sitting the mixing board... Duke Reid was in front of me and I was sitting beside Errol and Marquis but I wasn't listening to see if I could hear what he was talking about. All of a sudden I heard a shot ring out. Duke took out him gun and fired a shot in the corner, right by me. And he said "That damn rat." There was no rat there, he just wanted to get us listening, saying that we are idling. The shot was so loud I just jump. That's Duke. Actually, at Studio One we were the first to be recording strictly local and I think because of that I had the edge over the other producers who had to rent a studio, or whatever it is. And then the 60's was a very good period for me, because I went into strictly... building of artists, you know? Man, we used to wear some suits, I tell you, man, cos' first time it was more uniform than now! So we had to go to a tailor and get some flashy suits. We can look at the Clarendonians LP. Some flashy things going down! I was about 19. It was so exciting and feels so good to know that. Because really Wailers was the upcoming group at that time. A young group, more revolutionary, and to know that I was among the Wailers was very exciting. Oh, it was lovely. Studio One is the place where I really enjoyed my youth. It was like a family feeling. The whole artists was there to help me, to help the kids. Well, I guess I had a competitor. Other people in the business with not much faith in the business. Because I think I was the first black man to really start with it as a business. Both having the studio, having the shop, the record store and even starting to export the records. In order to accelerate economic development and to raise living standards, Jamaica is putting increasing emphasis on producing for export. What was originally produced to meet the demands of a domestic market, must also now be suitable for export. These products must meet the high standards of quality set in the international market place. And have a distinct Jamaican characteristic, in craftsmanship content and design. At that time I was weak to music. Wherever it goes it lure me! Wherever a bunch of musicians get together playing, we find ourselves there. They used to play in the hills, Wareika Hills, they used to rehearse there and I used to attend rehearsals and things like that. And then the idea came up that I would keep a dance here in the city, my soundsystem plus their drums. We had that at the Success Club on Monday nights and it was a great success. When I left the Military Band I also left home, because getting involved with Rastafari at that time, you automatically became an outcast, so I used to find some rasta brethren where you could go and spend your time and I chose Count Ossie because I was in love with the way they play their drums there. And I like playing with the drums, so I chose that area to really spend most of my time. Through they were playing drums a lot of the wind instruments used to go by them as a means of rehearsing. Such as? Johnny Moore, Don Drummond, Tommy, same Roland. - And Count Ossie didn't mind that? - No, he loved that, cos' that was big and in his area he was the big guy because he had all sorts of top musicians coming by his place. You are now entering PORA, famous Monday night dancehall. Welcome, come on in. Good day, good day. So this was where we had the soundsystem set up here on stage. And this would be the dance hall. You had speakers like, right in front here, you had speaker at each end of the dance and the rest of the speakers would be outside on the lawn. So what would people be wearing? Suits? No, you wore casual, at times jeans was in. The dungaree. Everybody, cos' in this climate down here suit wasn't the right thing. Just a t-shirt. - What did the women wear? - They wear nice crazy clothes! Yeah! Did you ever come with your wife or did she never come? Well, yes, once in a while, but you know it's best to leave the wife take care of the home while you take care of the business. And the bar used to be just in that little section there. The bar where you served the drinks and the curry goat and whatever. How would people know to come here? Flyers, even like the night of the dance we used to have a car with horns playing, announcing the dance and throwing out flyers. Did you have banners? Yes, because 2 weeks before the night of the dance you'd have a banner out there and you'd have your regular invitations that you'd give out at least 2 months prior to the dance. - This is where you're from. - Yes, all this area. So did you know most of the people? Yes we know most of the people, but actually what really draw the crowd is the dance promoter. Every dance hall and we walk, from one to one. But things have changed. These young people. We keep our cool, while they end up like a fool! We'll take a quick one over there. When I opened here we didn't have a store at the front, we had a store at Orange Street, and Beeston Street, and there was another store I had on East Queen Street and Duke Street and the third store I had was Beckford Street and West Street. That was in a nice busy area where country folks come and sell their products. We were importing records and also selling local records. But I wasn't really pinned down. I always had somebody looking after the stores and I was floating around doing other stuff like recording... and enjoying myself. Yeah. Because of that drive, why there was a Studio One as such. Instead of making money and buying a nice house and cut him ten, he took that money and he build a studio and when the studio started working he buy a pressing plant, and when the pressing plant started working he make a restaurant, and then he make a printery and everything was going back in the business. He was just behind it like that. Other producers would take the money build a house. Or buying property or go into another business. It was music, music. Just one business for Coxsone, ever since. Yes, I'm Sister lgnatius from Alpha Boys School. I came to Alpha Boys SchooI in 1939. So, what musicians went to Alpha? Lennie Hibbert, Johnny Moore, Tommy McCook. They were the one who was turning out the very good musicians away from the army. And even the musicians who come from the army didn't have the flex that was coming from Alpha. The ones coming from the army was too militant, too straight. The guys coming from Alpha had a souI of their own. They could solo and feel the music. We did a little Beethoven, some Verdi, some Bach, a little Tchaikovsky. Verdi... The scope was wide. Sister lgnatius seems to know you quite well. She's a darling. A very nice lady. When did you first get to know each other? From Don Drummond's time, she's so with it that she could hum every one of Don Drummond's songs, just like that! Well, we had a soundsystem which I bought for ?35. From an old boy. And we used to play on Saturdays. They would play dominoes, dance to ska, because they used to like to dance, in those times. And the ska had its own movements etc., so we played from after lunch to about 5 and then we'd pack up and go. I was actually at the studio and I went to do a show in Harbour View for the government. Some holiday. And I and Supersonic, I was lead vocal to Supersonic, that night. And there was a schoolband who played before us. The schoolband were playing. There's this little guy you know, all over the piano, upside down, foot on his head, Come here, watch this little youth here and that was all over the keyboard, like it's nothing. And that was Jackie Mittoo. It was Jackie Mittoo. I thought he was young. So maybe he was about 17 or 18. But he was playing with another band at that time. The Sheiks or something like that. He came to the studio as a youth. And he came to the studio every day from college. Beginning to play in his uniform and this went on for about almost a year. 'Til one morning, 11 o'clock, Jackie came to the studio no school uniform: Yes, end of college! No more college for Jackie Mittoo. Then he came here and he got the job because Monty Alexander had migrated to the States. Sometime even after session, when everybody gone, we'd be having a couple of drinks and planning what's the next groove for tomorrow and things like that. He's there playing. Counting in the artists, back to the piano, counting the bass, and the bass would play the note and find it. Even the singers, people like me who didn't have musical schooling, there's certain times that my timing would be out. And Jackie would tell me "Wait." And bring me in on the right time. He was a god. Yes, I'm Rickenbacker. I'm Sylvan Morris. I'm electronics engineer. My name is EarI Walker, but my ordinary name that they gave me is "the Great Bagga"! Well I'm Sylvan Morris, I'm an engineer that worked at Studio One during the period of the 1960s. I was here for roughly about 8 years. In which period we did a lot of recordings which eventually became famous. The musicians they were in-house. And they sort of made you feel in the groove. It was a groovy thing. Jackie Mittoo was the main arranger. So it was really a big band. Leroy Sibbles was the man who played the bass, and Rickenbacker. Eric Frater, he was the guitarist. PhiI who used to play drums. We also used Horsemouth and Robbie Lynn. He came on roughly after Jackie Mittoo had left. Jackie Mittoo was one of the main guys who got the groove together. The sessions. He was a groovy cat. We would do the rhythm tracks first, and afterwards we'd do the overdubs. And sometimes, depending on the type of tune, we'd probably do some horns over the horns. Depending on the type of tune, so we'd run it from one tape to another tape, so somebody would have three sessions of dubbing. Would the quality not change? Being the type of person that I was, because I did the maintaining of all the machines and I kept them all up to such a standard that you hardly notice, there'd be some depreciation but you'd hardly notice it. What were some of the singers that you backed? Well, I do Larry Marshall, Heptones, Ken Boothe, ... Fat Girl, Heptones. Mr Dodd, while thinking himself to enhance the music he bought a piece of equipment. The name of it was "Sound Dimension". Now in those days it was a loop tape and it was like a tape player, but it had three different heads, and one of the heads was movable. So he had bought this thing: at that time advanced equipment. A loop tape. So you'd record, send the signal in, pick it back up, so you could actually move the tape head. So what they did was put the guitar on this piece of equipment. So when Eric Frater played you got this... And I think this is one of the things that actually started the Reggae. Because it came not just by thinking alone, it came by sound also. So this is where it started. So this piece of equipment was very important. But I could tell you what really gave us that hit was the guitar going through that "Echoplex". And that formed a double sound on the guitar, instead of the crack going up, it went... So we started to complement it with the piano and the clavinet, here. When we play Ska, Mr Dodd had this machine called an "Echoback". A drum or an echo, you see one time you go, check it. And we all just glued to that sound, because at that time we had Nanny Goat, Baby Why, Love is a Pleasure. And if you listen to those you'll hear the definite changes. Who Done It, Ram Jam, Fat Girl. So after really getting stuff like that and testing it on the dancehall and see how the people react to it, then we use the same process and glue other things to it and there comes reggae! How many songs were you recording a week? A week at that time? We worked 4 days a week. We did 7 tunes, 10 tunes a day! A thing that Jackie Mittoo did, which I haven't seen anybody do, if he used a bassline, he'd play the bassline backways, the same bassline from the back to the front. Studio One was a special place for all the artists, Robbie Lyn, Rickenbacker, Bagga play bass there. Did you record a lot with Eric Frater? Too much, too much, too much. Well I can be totally frank to you, I would say about 75% of the tunes we did we could tell right away. There were some tunes that really fool us. Some tunes you think wasn't so great, and then they become greater than even what you thought was good! This is the nature of it. So how many records do you think you recorded at Studio One? Oh, gee, I really can't check them. So much, every one a hit. Mr Dodd come in and say: "Hit!" "Yeah, hit, hit!" When you have a hit record everybody try to duplicate the sound, if it not the exact sound, then try to break it down. So everybody started in that direction just after that. So that's why reggae became huge, because everyone was copying it. Did that make it more fun for you? Or worse? Make it more fun for me because we were always in front and up 'til then what I had over the average producer was that it was an everyday thing for me. As a matter of fact, some time I went to bed humming a line that I wanted to put into a song tomorrow. I had to hold it so that I don't forget it tomorrow because I'm not able to write as a musician, so whatever sound or idea I have to glue it up here 'til the morning, so even over supper l'd be humming. It was really nice. - Did your wife not mind that! - No, she didn't mind. She's swing too, you know, she's a nice person, she's swing. So basically your whole life, 7 days a week, making music. Yes, that even some of the time she couldn't believe that I'm coming from the studio, she figure that I'm coming from a lady's home, she couldn't believe it's all that! But I enjoyed what I did, my whole life. I was living at Fifth St, Bob Marley lived at Third Street, in fact Trench Town is where the music... It's the birthplace. All the singers start from First Street up through Twelfth Street, the last block. So all the way up you can find named artists. And my street, that is where Morty Planner lived. At the end of my street. Undaunted by the driving rain, a sea of faces awaited at the airport the arrival of a living legend. For some he was the king of kings, The lion of Judah even a god. But to most he was a mild-mannered monarch who had won the respect and admiration of the nation. The air was charged with excitement as anxious, expectant faces searched the skies for the great silver bird that would bring their hero to Jamaican soil for the first time. Members of a local cult, the Rastafarians, easily distinguished by their long beard and unshorn locks who worship this figure as a deity, were present in full force. OK, when we started the roots songs, the hardcore roots songs, this is when the rastafarian culture began to creep into the music and began to link with us. Morty Planner is the leader of the Rastafarian organisation and the '72 government sent a delegation of Rasta men to Africa to analyse the Rastafarian situation. So when Planner got involved with the recording business, we gather in Planner's yard everyday. All of us interested... If you're not even interested, that yard became the base of the musicians at that time. All the musicians in there. Anyone. Roland Alphonso, Jackie Mittoo, The Wailers, that's where the Wailers got their inspiration, myself, all of us, used to be there on and off. Smoking herb and playing music, reading Bible that was the three main thing. And listening to the Rastafarian doctrine. That is where I met up with Peter Tosh. Someone told him that I would like to get in the business, and he took me down Second Street, and there I met Bob and Bunny, a whole lot of things were going on. Cooking, herbs a-burning and "man irie" and Planner, Mortimer Planner. I follow his imperial majesty teachings. Selassie, who you hear them talking about. They aren't talking about no god, he's a man. Whose teaching is very relevant in this time. Coxsone and Morty Planner were good friends. They are age-bracket people, understand? One of Planner's close friends was the drummer for Bob Marley. When Seeco did the percussion that was why Seeco was always with Bob, cos' that's where Seeco saw Bob first, and took him by Mr Dodd. I stopped soundsystem about early 70s. But at that time I was supplying 90% of the soundsystem dubs. We had a dub machine. This was a thing that helped the music a lot. The sound men came and we would suggest certain rhythms that we thought were good. And they would promote it. But what they did was sometimes they'd change the name of the tune and they did that so another sound man couldn't ask for it. When the sound man asked they gave a different name than what we gave. So they had a lot of rivalry, trying to hide the sounds. 200 people in the yard. Believe it! Musicians came from all over trying to be a singer. See all the greats, people come to meet us. They hear about us. People come just to meet us. From abroad, from up town. The Wailers. Delroy Wilson, Marcia Griffiths, Bob Andy, you name them, they came from Sir Coxsone! The Wailers would be on the same premises, writing a song, and I'd be over there and the Gaylads over there. Sometimes all of us writing a song together. We end up teaching each other, but there was strong competition going on. But no corruption. Just strong competition. This guy over here he knows a good song. You want to do something to counteract that one! But it used to be fun, happiness always. It used to be so nice. Here was like a maze of people 24/7, when Coxsone's mother would be cooking the best soupees. You're hungry? No problem, you get something to eat. There was something in the air, smoking a lot of herb, and playing lots of tunes on the guitar, then you'd not see your guitar for days, then it's Horace Andy. Some people come to mind immediately, I was like a bigger brother to them. You'd have to go and search, find the guitar, things like that. We just hung out. It was the best place to be. This is Youth Promotion Center, as you know. We are 1979, coming from out of the ghetto, Maxine Park and all of that. Just trying to refurbish the centre. This is artists. We start off with the legend over here. This is Ken Boothe, this my teacher. This is my greatest inspiration in Studio One music, then comes Alton Ellis and Dennis Brown, the youth that inspired us, that let us know that youth could do something. Dennis Brown. Never forget that. Dennis Brown is the head for all youth in music. Freddy McGregor, my best friend at Studio One for years, Horace Andy, Boris Hammond used to be my rival. Soul. They used to put Boris Hammond against us ragga. He always used to win! Cos' the society was... Errol Dunkley. Was a good artist at Channel One. MichaeI Rose. When I went to Tubby's first person I met, MichaeI Rose, on the fence. Barrington Levi. First time I hear him he was singing my songs. He say "Go ahead and sing." I say "No. Leave the youth alone." And he flat me. Melodians, who represent Treasure Isle, who we love. Heptones, the greatest group ever come in reggae music, The Heptones, remember that. There's no song ever like that, "The Heptones' On Top" is the greatest album ever released on Studio One. Better than mine. They drive me crazy with their melodious harmony. Stuff like that. - They were very successful. - Very successful. I had minded a group so much that I realized that to keep a group like that I had to really carry them. I had a place on Beechwood Avenue. I boarded them there. Gave them three rooms up there. I decided to help Leroy by purchasing a bass guitar. - Was he just a singer? - Yes, just a singer, and I showed him it wasn't strong enough to bring in an income. So I had Ernest Ranglin tutor him how to play the bass guitar and then he got a lot of help from... from Jackie Mittoo, because basically Jackie could use his left hand on the piano and play the notes that he needed to play. Day by day he was here, learning and earning. ln the early 70's it was obvious that we were the top studio releasing records of the artists so new artists flock here on Sundays. On Sundays we had our auditions, so maybe l'd get here by 10 o'clock. They would be out front. I'd come to the gate. Sometimes I'd ask other artists or musicians to assist me by going quickly through the bulk of artists and to just let who sounds even halfway decent I'll deaI with them. I sang for Sir Dodd, Jackie Mittoo, Lee Scratch Perry and Bim Bim. Those were the first 4 persons I sang to. Peter Tosh was the person who played the guitar for me, because at that time I couldn't play the guitar. I sang 4 songs. And Coxsone stopped me, asked me where I'm from. I told him I'm from Port Antonio, he said "OK don't sing any more, come in tomorrow!" So how many would be there at the start? Well, certain Sundays you'd find there'd be 100 artists or more out there, so then you know we'd have to really filter it out and let the ones that sound not too bad and I'll deal with them. The band I came here with was the Soul Defenders. - What period? - That was 1970. Well, the band played together at Studio One until 1976. The nucleus of musicians that were always here, would be Leroy Sibbles, Bagga would be here and that same guitarist I told you about, Ron and Rickenbacker, he was the lead guitarist and we had Cedric Brooks. He played on saxophone. And sometimes Roland Alphonso and Tommy McCook. So did you take over from Leroy Sibbles? We both were here at the same time cos' mainly he was singing. But he played a lot of great bass lines too. But he wasn't... he never knew that he would come to this, but he had a long finger and he could stretch and he knew the music, so he's good. He was good. What's the difference in your styles? Not really any difference, I've just been playing such a long time that I'm good. I can do any work. Even Pavarotti. "Soul Defenders" name isn't as well known as some of the others. No, we played with different names, we played as "Sound Dimension", we played as "Studio One All Stars", we played as "Brentford Road All Stars", - "Brentford Disco Set". - "Underground Vegetables". We had a lot of names. And what are some of your favourite records you recorded at Studio One? I can't count, I can't say. - Any you remember? - I can't count. Horace Andy, well, we used to call him Sleepy, because by the time you speaking to him you know he'd be asleep some place! He used to sleep a lot. Yes, Horace Andy again, he came in, but I had liked Horace for his unique voice. His voice sounded to me different, more like a youth, although he was a grown-up. The Dub LP was one of the things that was responsible for breaking new DJs and artists, because they had the rhythm now to rehearse on, they could DJ until they got perfect. I think sound men were the ones who drove me to that area. Because we started to do the drum and bass on one track and the rhythms on one. The sound men would come, every man would like to get his tune sounding different. So you'd give it to one sound man and the next man would say "Boy, how can I get this sounding different?" So we'd add in some of the things and drop out some of the things. To give it that version thing. So instead of just doing a straight thing it sound different. Well, that now is dub, playing with the control. In and out with the guitars and steady bass, bass and drum coming at you. That is really dub. Yes, man, without a doubt because I became skilful in trying to make a sound sound different. Echo, reverb, equalizers, sometimes you put them on a drum double sound. All sorts of different things. What got me hip now in the early 70's there were 60% of the soundsystems loved my tracks so they come and order dubs. So because of them ordering them, then you'd be aware of the music of the day that is going. So maybe you'd just put an artist on it to do a new rendition of it and that helped me to really keep with what was happening out there. This is Lincoln Sugar Minott, singer, song writer, producer, Black Roots Production, Youth Promotion. Originally out of Studio One stable Sir Coxsone Dodd, Respect One Love and Unity. I checked myself as being the Son of Studio One. I'm SOS 1, I know Studio One spiritually before I knew Studio One physically. You know I grew up beside a dancehall, Sir Coxsone sound used to play so from when I was a boy Sir Coxsone's sound. So, from that influence, I used to love Studio One music so much, I became a selector. And I selector, like sound selector. That was my first involvement with getting to know Studio One music. Like Heptones, Leroy Sibbles, those guys like Alton Ellis, Ken Boothe, the whole works. It was my whole life. My audition was different. Like everybody was there with guitars and all that, drums... I was there because of my voice. I didn't go with the intention for there to be a band.. They took me, played the rhythm. Spot on, because I was singing so long. The first time. Boom, boom. So it was literally a revelation to Mr Dodd? Mr Dodd was thinking of making new rhythms because Mr Dodd isn't a person who thinking of repeating. He want to go on, right? But what was playing wasn't half as good as what was there. So cos' I used to sing this from soundsystem days I had 20 songs already on Studio One rhythms Here comes a guy says "I can make songs with these rhythms." "I don't need no band." And Here comes Mr DC, Vanity, Never Going to Give Jah Up, House is Not a Home. Hit after hit. Freddy McGregor got revived... Freddy instantly got a vibe... Starts out a whole new thing so Mr Dodd started on the same rhythm. A whole new revolution. - It's the start of dancehall. - That's it. Because this was the next period. Channel One started making over Studio One songs. Mr Dodd hears so much music, he's not going to hear that. That's Mean Girl. So I said "Mr Dodd, listen. That's Mean Girl." So they put out Mean Girl, and we put out I Need A Roof. So you were responding to versions by reversioning? Yes, yes, and one like... Channel One. We hit that one before they release it! But they was like thief, and we taking it back. So it was like, you know, the Answer. I named those songs Answer. I named those songs, cos' it was the only singer who could take those songs of Studio One, could take it away. I could take. Nobody could take the song but me. So when King Tubby was going to play Coxsone's we made a song over night with an old song by Roland Alphonso, we just gave it the name, so all these songs were renamed. They're not the original names of Studio One, only Mr Dodd knows the real names of these songs. Not even me. I don't know. So that was a good period to know Sugar Minott. You know, I'm Studio One career. I'm Ken Boothe, I'm Alton Ellis, I'm Dennis Brown. All of them's me. I absorb everything from all of them. You're saying Channel One, but it was just everyone? This was the beginning of it, Channel One first, then Joe Gibbs are the professionals which is using the same Sly and Robbie, So it was version for version and it was licking back their sound, but it was our original rhythms and Mr Dodd wasn't getting money, no publishing, people just do it. Fresh. Old become new, recycling. ln the 70's we stopped playing at dances because we felt the behaviour of the fans wasn't too right. They couldn't go on all night any more because if it's not the rude boy going to shoot up the dance it's the police, if it's not the police going to shoot up the dance it's the soldiers, so if you go to a dance you know very few dances is going to go through. It was about when they started to really shoot up the dances. - So it got a bit dangerous. - Yes it got a bit dangerous so I figure I've had my fill with it. The violence in Jamaica, a lot of people think that it's an island-wide thing. It's not an island-wide thing, it's restricted to certain areas. Bad Man likes good things, Bad Man likes the best things. As a matter of fact, Bad Man likes to wear the best clothes, drive the best cars, listen to the best music, so wherever there's a DJ that is happening the rude boys, they would be there. I'm really happy about that part of the continuous sales of my product. Well, the thing is the time we were able to put in to it and lyrically we stayed close to the music. Because I tried to be part of improving the lyrics at times, and away from that we tried to make every song sound different and even we tried to make new introduction, to sound different from the other songs. And in the early days we went in the studio with people like you in mind. We weren't just recording, we tried to do something that some people in other parts of the world would accept. There are a lot of songs that the producer would go in and make and it was just good for the island here. But we were thinking of, maybe you! You'd hear the soundsystem men refer to "dub plate". This dub plate would be at times... 10" with 4 different music tracks on it. And on the whole a dub is really the backing track of a vocal. To be honest with you my favourite song is a song called Power Version that I did for Studio One. All studios, that's my favourite song. Because I love the original song: You Can't Be Happy UntiI You Love Someone by the Clarendonians. I used to love that song. So when I went to Studio One I asked for that rhythm, I wanted to work with it and to date it's my Number One song. You see, sometimes you play the original then you play the version on a dub plate and they go wild! I came to Studio One back in the days, like in 1976, '7 7 when I just graduated from school and through a Christian Brethren who knew Mr Dodd and every Sunday he used to come and we used to rehearse rhythms. Rub a dubs. Coxsone's rub a dubs. And after we had mastered it, he said one day, "OK, we're going to check Mr Dodd." So we came here, this time it was me, Welton Irie, Barrington Livingstone, the three of us started together. So we came and me and Welton did a combination. A tune called Chase Them Crazy. After that me and Mr Dodd got together again and did Love Bump. 1980. That was a tune! Eighteen weeks at number one. That stamper broke while Mr Dodd was away. People couldn't get the record, and Mr Dodd came down, they told him, and he pressed it. It dropped to number 3, and when Mr Dodd came and he remade the stamper it went from number 3 back up to number 1. At that time the only competitors I had were Eek a Mouse The competition was stiff. He is not a producer who rushes you, or pushes things at you. You can't come in and rush. You have to come in and sit a bit and give him two talk and give him time while he drifts round the studio then he says "Jackson, which rhythm you want?" He lets you choose. Then you start to record. No matter how long. It could be 7, 8 hours, he doesn't stop you untiI you feel comfortable with what you've done. My favourite rhythms? All of Coxsone's rhythms are my favourite. You start off you have Stitch, you have Dennis Alcapone, you have the great U Roy and Jah Youth. U Roy and Jah Youth, Those were the two I hold onto when I was at school. When my mother used to give me my lunch money, you know what I used to do? l'd go straight to Randy's Records and bought all the Big Youth, all the U Roy that was ever released. And one night was a sound clash. Sound from East and a sound from West. A lot of veteran DJs. All those West DJs. All from West, coming to play in the East. I was the king DJ in the East, I was the strong one. The West sound was playing and all these DJs had hit tunes. Me? Not yet, but I was good, I was good in the ghetto. But I wasn't exposed. When it was my turn to go on and I took the mic and said... "My name's The Lone Ranger, I act like a stranger." From that night the name stuck. I kept it. - Where does it start? - Studio One. This is like a view. At times that we go and check what was happening in the store at times. - The shop was at the front. - The shop's in the front of that. - So it was a peek hole - Like a peek hole, yes So, why would you need that? Because we had a couple of breakeries in the front, - stick-ups. Actual stick-ups. - With guns? "Give me your money, babe." When was that? It started happening late 70s Is that when you started thinking you'd had enough? Yeah. Cos' actually I was in one of the shooting up. I came here one Saturday and Mrs Dodd sneaked out. I came here in the passage way and she told me there was a stick-up going on. So I went upstairs and went on the ledge and went along the front. So I asked the gate man to go check out what was happening, but like a silly he came up and said "Boss, there's a stick-up going on." So the guys follow him. Thank God I'm still here, but the guy, I was lucky enough to shoot him in the hip so the guys took him away. - You shot him? - In the hip. Yes, cos he was shooting at me and I shot at him. So his friend caught him two way under the shoulder, up the road. Things were so bad in Jamaica you couldn't get currency to purchase the material cos' at that time I was thinking... I was depending heavily on the factory so we needed to import pellets for the material but we had no funds for that, so we decided to go to New York for a while. You weren't able to press in no quantity to export. But we kept coming to and from. What do you think of your career so far? Well, I am very thankful. I'd say, thank God. It has moved from limb to limb and I'm still hoping that we can achieve more as time goes by, but on the whole, God gave me a very good mother. I can also say that of my wife, because my wife and family have been very helpful always there for me. And I have got longstanding friends who have inspired me, to keep on going. And looking back, I'm very thankful for all the good artists and musicians that I've worked with over the years. So, no regrets. This is Nanny's Corner, over there is my old liquor store, where I started from, and over here was my mother's restaurant and bar. Studio One is like a coconut tree rather than a cash crop. So I learnt to write good songs. Be a star! I never left Studio One yet. We used to play the soundsystem over there and my old lady she'd be over here. We used to hang out and have fun. At that time I was about maybe 22. BeautifuI memories, everything was cool and nice. Subs corr.: ~G
