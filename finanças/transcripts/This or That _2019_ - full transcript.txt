Aren't you happy? -I am soon to be Mrs. Irving. -And you know it. [Laughs] But look, I'll go shower real quick. Good, cause you stink. -Yeah, shut up. -You shut up. [Showering running] You know for someone who complains about the toilet seat being up what a countertop look like a damn beauty supply store. I haven't had time to put them up yet. We'll put them up. Okay. Oh shit. So what's this? Nothing can I have it back? Looks pretty expensive. Give me my box back, please. Where did you get it? Uh? Should I speak in like, Ebonics or something? Why are you getting mad? It's not that serious. Oh, don't try to turn this around on me. Where did you get this? Tamira? One of your homegirls? It was from an old friend, just a congrats gift, that’s all. That's still not giving me a name though. Mourice, okay. As in your ex Mourice? Why did he give you this? And when? -Was he at the club? -Yeah, he was there. He just wanted to say congrats, that's it. You find nothing wrong with this. Baby, honestly, it's nothing. He just wanted to say he was happy for me and that's it. I promise nothing is going on. You need to get this back to him. Right now. Oh, it's my baby getting jealous? You gotta be out of your fucking mind thinking this is fun. It is Mr. I don't get jealous. Well, the tables turned and Brandy gave me something. Would you be okay? Of course I wouldn't. Nothing about her is trustworthy, But I trust, but I don't trust that skank. She does't compare to me. Okay. So let's say I took her to lunch. What would you be taking her to lunch for? To break the news to her politely. Okay. I'd be cool with it. But I'll be there too. Oh, was I there when that clown gave you this box? Look, I guess I was just being nice and accepted the gift without thinking about it. You're right about that. You damn sure didn't think this through. You know you acting really insecure right now. Okay. So how about this? You can come and you can bring your homeboy Mourice too. You gonna bring up the gift? No. I'm not. Good night. Wait hold up! You let her get away with that? What do you mean? The same way I let you get away with cheating and having a baby? Well technically Beyonce gave all men a free passes -when she fogave hov. -Right. -So what happened next then? -Don't, don't, don't. At that point we... [Phone rings] Well, wakey wakey hangover huh? Whatever. Good morning love. Yes. Good morning my sunshine. And thanks for taking up three quarters of the bed last night. Pretty cool of you. Hmm, someone cranky this morning. Whoa, Riah, I love you but you ain't brushed your teeth yet. But if you love me then that shouldn't matter. Oh, I do. And that's why that toxic gaz breath ain't coming no where near me. Don't be an ass hole. So where you gotta go? I'm going to work out. And maybe grab a few items. Oh okay. What about you? Any plans later? Are you going to church? Yeah, I'm going later and then I think I'll go walk at Lake Cal. Okay, that's cool. Yeah. So, I noticed you got a password on your phone now. Yeah, I do so. So when do we start doing that? Since it's company's policy to have a password if you use a work email Mariah. And when were you going to tell me? Now. Don't be a smartass. Do I get the password? Sure, but I gotta go. The fellas are waiting on me. Wait, so we hiding stuff now? Were you hiding the gift you received last night? So we're still on it. I wasn't hiding it. I was gonna tell you. Nope, but you're right. It's whatever. I gotta go. Bye. I mean I still don't understand why you will accept that gift? Can you blame her? I'll probably do the same thing. -Oh really? -Did I stutter? Jazz and Shawn, please. Please Mariah, continue. -Well, to elaborate, Carla right? -Yeah. I don't know. I guess I was just stupid, not thinking. Do you think your past or say your secrets had an impact on your insecurities? Mariah, stop following me. You really getting on my damn nerves. Oh, I'm on your nerves. Then give me the password, to your phone then. Are you serious? A password? I'm your fiance. I should have your password. I'm busy. Maybe later. I'ma remember that shit. Are you cooking? Oh yeah, that's right. -You never cook. -I do cook actually. Hotdogs and noodles isn't exactly cooking. Dang girl. Why are you so into my phone? Because you're hiding something. Am I? Yeah, let me see. There, you see. Oh, and before I leave, the other night I noticed something. What? Your snap videos. You had on a bracelet. -Huh? -Huh my ass. You wearing that shit now? Mourice we already discussed-- What did you just call me? Mourice is the name of the bracelet. Let me see. -Why? -Because Because what? You already saw it in my Snapchat video. You're right. Okay. Okay, so can we just leave it at that? For sure. We will. So all this is coming to transpire into more arguments? Arguments was minor until what was about to happen. Hmm. This is good. This is good. You know, secrets have always been a common breaker in relationships. That's why I say honesty is always key. [Laughs] Doc you are so right, because it literally took this Negro two years to tell me about a secret child -he has stashed away. -Hey, hey, hey, hey, Come on now. We talk about them and you're trying to bring up our past. -We weren't even together. -No. No, Reyshawn shut up. because what you don't seem to understand is your past is in our present and future. Um, please allow me to chime in. But this sister has a hot ass temper. And she seems like an angry and bitter woman. Uh, excuse me, but do you even know me? How about you stay in your line. Just wait wait, just wait, chill. I didn't mean nothing by it, okay? But you had to put your raggedy 2 cents in. At least I've got 2 cents, okay? Please, everyone, let's relax. [Laughs] God. Nah, I'm not gonna lie that Jazz is quick tempered, always yelling, screaming, just violent. -Help me. -Hmm. And again, how does that make you feel? To be honest, Doc, make me feel like I'm not the man. Can you demonstrate for us? Oh, for sure. Watch yourself. Who is that Raysawn? She's talking shit? She better not cause I'ma beat her ass. I'ma slap something. Don't play with me cause I'm a black queen. Serious though, that was good, that was good. That was real cute Rayshawn. So now you take me for a joke uh? And why is that so damn funny? The brotha is good, Riah. He can really act. Whoa, you know what, First off, no disrespect homegirl but y'all dude seem like a real asshole. And typically when I ain't feeling somebody, I go in. But I have some class to that. I ain’t gonna dig in his ass. -Here we go. -No digging in. What do you mean "Here we go." If you only knew this shit I had to deal with it. -I'd want to slap the hoe. -Don't slap the hoe. Hey, y'all see that, right? Angry black woman. That's a damn shame. Uh, let's let's take a 10 minute, right. Uh, everyone we can manage that. Girls use this time to use restroom, get refreshments, whatever. Hey, y'all wanna go grab something to eat man?

Love, happiness. But first we need to re-think this engagement. What would you think about premarrige class? No. Do I have to remind you that you sent dick pics to ya ex? I was wandering around. And what about you, twerking and accepting gifts from your ex, on top of that hiding it? Really, Jeremih? You just want to act childish and fight Mariah. I don't wanna fight. I wanna work this out. So what's stopping us? Here, it's just a premarriage class. Think about it. [Sigh] Look, we both messed up. Only way we can fix this is if we work together. -Look Mariah... -What? -So... -Say it.

Just us being here to tell you all our story has brought a lot of clarity to us. You know what? Yeah, I think it has for us all. I agree. I've been a real asshole to Shana lately. Yes you have. In front of all these people, Shana, I apologize for the way I treated you. I didn't understand at first but now I do and I want to support your pipe dream. And I will follow you on Instagram. [Laughs] Okay, I wanna tell you all, you are all brave. All of you here. Though some of you did not want to attend, I believe that the story you two have shared with us has not only been inspiring. It's been encouraging and empowering. You two have raised the bar high enough where we all can grow. Yeah, so... Thank you all, truely. So what's next for you two? Well, the wedding is on hold for now. We're just gonna continue grow. And as the Bible says, love is patient and it is kind. Love does not envy or boast. It is not arrogant or rude.

Whose going next for story time? Yeah, for real. Who is next? Hi, y'all know me on Instagram. First he liked my pictures, then he hit me in the DM’s and then you know we moved.
