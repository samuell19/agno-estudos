THE HEAVY... MELON (Greek expression: When someone gets angry for any reason, because he thinks he's a tough guy when he's clearly not...) You see now? We are crushed so the big shots will make their fortune. You 're so grumpy brother. Deal with it like everyone else and quit whining. How? Can't you see this shit hole's dead? I hardly make ends meet. Had my father not died, you think I'd still be around here? Now I'll have to close anyway. That's life man, what did you expect? I warned you before the expropriations started but you never listened! Come now, quit that whole expropriations thing now, will you? 3 acres was all I had, and I was forced to give them away, like everyone else. Right now I'm talking about this shop and me, understood? How do I make a living damn it? I'm not gonna go over there to be a waiter, you hear? Yes you will... They built whole palaces, those bastards. If you and me won't go, they'll bring others. From Giannina, from Trikala, from Peloponnisos... What did you think? Let them do what they want, just keep me out of it. I know you and you know me and still don't like your faces... And you expect me to be a waiter for those Americans and those fouled German broads? Your eyes are fouled. What's with them, man... So firm. You see em... Oh you poor soul, you poor soul... There is the factory if you don't wanna be a waiter. I'm leaving suckers. I'm gone... Never to step foot here again. You gone nuts, right? What do you reckon? That everyone in Thessaloniki or Athens is a boss? It's worse than here you fool... Little by little you'll waste those money they gave you... Then mourn your luck in the end. What do you want me to say now? I'm telling you, it's all set, I've made arrangements. Ok, OK, we believe you... - Now tell me. Do you play backgammon? - No, I don't. - 1 in 5. - And I'm telling you, I don't play. One off, come on! - You're asking for it. - Alright... Here's my mother now, looking to say her thing. What is it ma? Go get the backgammon. In 5, alright? Come now... Why turn it down? Just a bit, like that. Turn it up more Aristides, we can't hear. Turn it up already! Now tell me, doesn't all that noise bother you? It's almost over, go now. Did you get a TV Mimi? There is one in the village, we didn't get one... And you're not married either, right? No kids, no dogs... Not yet. That's the deal! Don't mess with it! If you mess... Why, have you messed yourself? What I mean is one should not mess with these things lightly. For me, personally, how is it a mess for me? I'm in the dance now anyway, pal. Mother in law, Nitsa, the kids. Obligations, get it? It's a ball, and it's turning. What is there to complain about... You look all settled to me. In the army, do you remember your words? Leave the army out. We were soldiers then and everything was given to us, remember? Send something to the kid who's serving. And here come the checks. "No way, a troop and paying" and all that, right? Finished my duty as a Commander and now everything I have goes here, you understand? That's the thing. That's not what you were saying. You were in a rush to finish duty, get made and get married, right? - You've changed your mind. - I haven't, OK. The lady is fine, everything is fine. This everyday race, you get me? Work, eat, sleep, work again... You do nothing, you understand? Nothing is left, that's the thing. What's up, has the baby calmed down? The baby is a baby and it will cry and it will whine. Isn't that so? What's with your whining, I'd like to know. We're having a conversation. Can you have a conversation like that? Go out then. Isn't that what you want anyway? The whole deal is to find an excuse and go out of the house. Aristides in the house? God forbid. Or do here what? - Take us to swim. - Now? - Now. Do we not have the right? Quit with the jabs. All I’m saying is going to swim on a Sunday is for fools. You realize the traffic? Leave it for another day. Another day, another year... We have work to do, you understand that? If it's about swimming, we set a date and I'll take you. - It's not. - Let's go Mimi. We know you too well... Don't you dare drag the man on card games and lame hangouts. - Nitsa! - Nitsa what? The man came to Athens for work, not for tourism. - He has some money and... - You talk too much... Mimis is not an infant to push around. Let's go. Goodbye. Take care. We expect to see you tonight. - I don't know... - Let's go! Goodbye! Crisis, Aristo, crisis. Nothing's moving brother. I know, but... Since he's a good friend, you understand? He came from the village with that prospect... We talked about it and I told him to come, you understand? 50 grand though, they're peanuts. If that was at least 200... And the rest in a check... I could give him a shop to settle the man. So there's nothing we can do? No chance? For the time being, no. Let's wait for the business to get going, some more cash... And we'll see, alright? Things look tough. I told you so, didn't I? How to get some cash man... What's in the village for you anyway? Are you going back? Don't know. I'll see. We'll find something man. Don't get bummed out. Crisis they say. Cunts... Well, you got a home for one thing. Let's go play some cards and we'll figure it out.

We were waiting to take care of you... now you want to leave like that... - But it's OK, don't worry. - But why... You see, I have to meet a friend from the same village and to Aristides after that. OK then, here is the card with the address and the phone number. By why like that? Don't bother, I'm not a stranger now, am I? [♪ Stelios Kazantzidis: "Pente Pano, Pente Kato"] - Still here? - The buses are full. And you suppose an empty one will come by, eh? Where are you heading? To the market, to deliver these trousers. I'll take a taxi. If you want, I can drop you there... A taxi, huh? Now that the cash is flowing. - The cash should flow, what's the point otherwise? - Right. Did you see that? Alright. Shall we? - What about your job? - Later, its fine. Won't be long. I'll drop this off and be back. Alright, I'll wait. - Are you done? - Yes. Are you busy now, do you have to leave? Why do you keep asking, you want something? To go for a walk, kill some time... But you have things to do. Yes, later. Let's go somewhere to buy you a sweet and have a chat. If you don't mind, that is... It's nice here, right? It's OK... So you get paid by the item, right? I mean, depending on how many pants you sew. Yes, when there is a job. Because the big stores have their own machines, girls, you know how it goes. I only work for some small boutiques. And for the time being, I make ends meet. In any case, one should go out now and then. To get away from the everyday stuff, you know. I see you every day, struggling with the machine... - That's not right. - It's not like that. Unless there are any... ..."interests" that I'm not aware. It's not like that I'm telling you. There are interests I have... and there are dreams, like everyone, but all that is irrelevant. What is there to talk about? When you are wearing out your hands and eyes on the machine all day there is no time left for you, you understand? Come now, don't make it sound so tragic. There is time for everything, if you really want it. But only if you really want it. Don't change the subject. What I'm saying is, the way we live here those interests you mention, they are for some, not for us. Now listen here Toula... I am a man determined and I don't scare easily. Things may be hard, as you say, but... there are more opportunities here than in the village. You haven't lived in a village and you don't know. I'm talking about your wallet. "While my wallet is good" you said. For how long, huh? Get a bed, two chairs, the rent, a fridge, half is gone. Up in smoke. Then what? If your feet are not firm on the ground you get no respect. OK, everything you said is correct. But I'd like to ask you something and please be honest with me. - Could you do that? - What? Why do you care about me? I mean, why do you mind whether I break my face or not? Because... Because we happened to get to know each other? Sure. It's you that wanted us to talk. Yes, OK, deal. I wanted to get to know you better. But what I'm asking is, this interest you have... Does it end here or is there more to it? - It depends. - On what? Is there any... obstacle? Nothing like that, because there is no one. I am single. I'm getting sick in there with my sister, the kids and the whining. But what you ask is a whole other matter and I'm telling you "it depends". We can talk about it, right? Not now, I have to go. Make your arrangements, and we'll talk again. But part of these arrangements... Is you. I have to go now, we'll speak again, we won't be strangers. - But when? - We'll see. - So, bye and thanks you for the treat. - Bye. Bye. Give it a turn now. - Nothing. - It doesn't pull now, does it? It doesn't. It gets stuck somewhere in here, there's no other explanation. - Do I open it or not? - No. Screw it back and let it be. It does the job. What job? You should throw it away and buy a new one. No, I'll have it repaired and see how it lasts. I wouldn't throw out 20 large to buy a new one. It'll break your nerves. You'll change it someday anyway. - Does it do the job? Then it's fine. - OK, stand back. - Did something happen to him? - Who? Mimis. He should be back, shouldn't he? "He should be back"... His mind, is like Toulas's machine... It gets stuck somewhere, you understand? - You mean he might not come at all? - Now? No way. He's a strange bell, I know him well. And where will he sleep? He'll find a hotel I guess and he'll lay down. I saw him this morning, he got stuck somewhere. Good lad. But a "screw". A screw... - So, all good? - Everything's fine. You'll hand me the money and everything is fine. I'll give you a receipt as well, OK? So... The contracts will be made by the owner and the lawyer. But since you are in... there is no rush for that. So, here's the money. 6, 6500, 6600. Two rents upfront and one running. Here you are. If it wasn't for me, to tell him what a fine young man you are... They don't normally like bachelors here. - And this is for your trouble... - Ah, thank you very much. Much obliged, a great deal. You'll see what a nice time we'll have here. So... There are no apartments in Athens, you know that, right? So, here is the receipt. Good luck. And I'll take care of the rest. - OK, thank you very much. - Painting, cleaning... - We'll make a beauty out of it. - OK, thank you very much. - And please, the keys on the door, you see? - Thank you very much. - Me too, me too, bye! Bye my good man. Good luck. You'll see what a nice time we'll have here. Open the window, it's hot. What a view! Is the bed OK here? It's fine, just fine. - Better now? - Right? A roof over my head and a bed to lie down. - The rest is on the way. - Right. So you're building a household now. Obligations... - A woman's all is left now, right? - Depends. Seriously? I was only joking. Nothing's going on, but... Since you ask, I'm telling you it depends. I see. Our budget's going gone. Fridges, ovens... dining rooms. You said we would set up a business here. You said, I never changed. If my money is good to set up a business, fine. But I have to live as well, you understand? Wait till when Aristides? Dining rooms? Dining rooms. One thing's for sure, I'm not going back to the village. You're a weirdo, that's for sure. - We're off! - Why, what happened? Don't you hear? We're blocking the street. Come on, let's go and we'll continue later. - Where to? - You're done here, aren't you? Let's go. I've made plans with the women to take them swimming. They're still worried the way you vanished last time. OK, OK! By the way. Where did you go? Hotel? - But I don't have a swimsuit. - I'll get you one. Let's go. I'll wait outside, OK? [♪ Stelios Kazantzidis: "I Esthimaties"] Aren't you going in? In that mud, no way. - That's what we got here. - OK, I'm not complaining. But if you ever swim back where I come from, you'll never go back in here. 10 meters in and you can still see the bottom. Nice. Beach, sand, everything. Have you ever been to my hometown? No. If you want, we go together. - Back at it, right? To the issue. - For sure. I got a house as well. I heard. It's up to you then. I am very persistent, you know that. They'll hear... Mimi... ["Marika!"] What are you doing? I was thinking to... Go out for a walk. Go. And look for a job while you're at it. - You're leaving? - Yes. You're gonna be late? Depends, on the jobs. - OK then, bye. - Bye. [Market noises] ["Work slave, work!"] ["Come on, move on. Move!"] Useless stuff... I talk, but who listens. What do you want ma? What are you on about, huh? I'm saying what's right. Sit down and have your coffee, always peeved. Things will settle, little by little. Now sit down... Fooled by romance. You and your sister both. What is it with you? What? I want you to be reasonable. I'm your mother. I can't watch you living in this basement and tell me you're settled. Speaking of which... Has he found a job or is he still wandering around? Damn it... Give me a break, we just got married! What we do, is his business and mine. Did anyone bother you? Am I stranger, not allowed to speak? You should be ashamed of what you say. Shame on you! And let you ruin yourself? Let me get out of the way. Be gone and leave you be. What do you want, damn it? What? WHAT DO YOU WANT? - Hello. - Welcome. How's everything? Here, having a chat. Good. Have it then. So, the way you present it to us... It's like your daughter is really suffering with our groom, right? Don't mock me please. I never said anything about suffering and such. I only say what I see and understand. So what is it that you understand ma, enlighten us. People don't get married like that. They don't start families in a rush. What did the guy do to you? He's an OK lad. Never stole, neither harmed anyone. You should have seen him. "Having a chat? Have it then". Backstabber... How he managed to grab that dim wit. She never even noticed. Bird brained. Stop it ma, yapping all the time. Toula has brains and she has hands. She's not a child. Now, if it doesn't work out, so what? She won't be the first nor the last. In a rush all the time... Go to bed already. Haven't you watched your series today? I don't get why you make it such a big deal. Your mother stretches it from here, you stretch from there... - So why talk back to her? - Me? You, of course. If there is no issue, why talk? And do what instead? Don't you get me started. There is an issue, a family one. And we have to be on watch. Hire a detective then. What on earth are you talking about? Do you understand? I do. I'm talking about your friend. My friend is an OK guy and he is my friend. And Toula is my sister and her daughter. Let's slaughter each other for no reason. Why the hell do you get in the way? We're just talking. Do we not have that right then? What is it with those rights... This is not just talk, you understand? If they had some problem, OK. If they were in danger, fine, I understand that. It is about that and please stop shouting. Because I can't stand it. We're trying to figure out what the problem is, to help them. They don't have to get through... what some "others" have been through. We're a family. If we don't help them, who will? So why all this, huh? I'm talking to you, why don't you say something? What's all this now! Turn around and talk already! What is it damn it? What? What's with you? What did you think? That I'm one of those sluts who spread their legs whenever their man feels like it? - Be quiet. - You understand what I'm saying or not? I do understand. But why are you telling me all this? And speak without screaming. What do you want me to say? We got married to be together. To understand each other. Not just to fuck me. Well, that's good too, right? So what do you do? You wander around... And I don't know what you're thinking. Why? Because you're the man of the house. What I'm saying, is stop acting like a "heavy melon"... Because you make people suffer for no reason. I don't want to be a heavy melon, nor do I want anyone to suffer. And I got married to be together, not just... ...to fuck, like you say. You know that. And what happened before, it was because... ...I just wanted to talk. We're tied to a knot in here. I couldn't find... ...another way, you understand? What I'm saying is... ...you have to find a job. Even just for a while. That's the issue. To know what's going on. So no one can say a damn thing. Do you understand? One beer please. One beer please. Smile, man. You'll get used to it. Keep your chin up, or you'll have a hard time here. No worries. Have you been to the army? You have, huh? Does this remind you of something? - "ATTENTION!" - "Yes Sir! At your command!" Poor rookie... Tell that to the full-timers, I'm just passing by. I'm not here to go up the rank. Yeah, right. You just happen to be here. Family matters and such, right? We've heard that one before... They're still waiters. I don't care about the others. Look friend. There's no shame in work, eh? And what we do here, is no worse than elsewhere. The easy life is... for them. You're here to preach now, are you? Maybe. Either way, those of us that... are OK with being waiters, we have a union. I mean, you can come by if you want. Now I see where you're coming from. But I told you, I'm not interested. I'm just passing by, understood? Alright... See you again, eh? "Be right there" Get the hell out of here! With your fumes in our face... Scram! God damn you all. Your tooth? Does it hurt? You still want coffee, right? That's what I'm waiting for. [♪ Dimitris Mitropanos: "Kane Kati Na Chaso To Treno"] So take an aspirin, it's no big deal. The thing is I never had a toothache before. They were solid. They come with aging... Sometimes you're so smart... ...makes you wonder. You should look into it. We should have health benefits, you and I. We are only humans. Right... You should have health insurance, stamps and all, you know that? I know. So what do we do now? I say we go by the casino, you know, show up and stuff. What's to do? We'll eat, lie down, you can watch TV... Right... And then work again, then eat again, then go to bed. Sounds like fun. - Ready yet? - I'm waiting. ♪ This cigarette, now burning... ♪ ♪ Will soon go out ♪ My shaky hands... Nice. What more do you want, you poor thing? Who gave birth to you to ask for more? Why are you not more careful? I'm talking to you. And when I talk, you answer. - I'm busy now. - You're going nowhere! You do what I say. - What is it? - Why are you not more careful? Where do you think you are? In a neighbourhood taverna? My tooth hurts. No one cares. Not me, nor your customers. (Keep sickness out of the work, you hear?) And use the polite form. You talk too much, eh? Lay off your hand before I shit on your place your customers and everything. Understood? Get lost! Get lost right away! (I'll deal with you later) What's wrong, where are you going? Wherever I want. It's my right, isn't it? Alright. But why leave? Why do you care friend? I command myself, you understand? Go about your business. If people like you are OK with every bastard ordering them around, I'm not, you understand? So long. What are you up to, in the dark? Sitting. Right... - Didn't you go to work? - I did. Then how come you're here? I left. Why? Because that's what I wanted! Should I to answer to you? And quit with the questions... "Did you go to work?" "Why did you leave?" I left because that's what I wanted, you hear? I'm nobody's slave. I see... You came all worked up for a fight. And cover everything up, eh? No mister. We'll talk now and get over with it. What's to talk about, I'm playing fool round here. You're playing fool? Or me, trapped in this basement with no one to talk to? You never said a thing. [Toula: Look at him] "Very nice, my love" [Toula: No words] "We'll be fine, my love" And how did we end up, my love? We get it now! We get your trick! An old trick! All sweet and charming before... Remember, my love? I wasted all my money to end up a waiter. I never fooled you, I believe what I say. And I'm not a fool myself! I left my village to become a waiter in Athens. You don't say, who do you think you are? And what's that about your money all the time? And then she came to check on us. How we make her poor kid suffer. Quiet you poor soul, quiet! Then men are to blame. You'll end up telling us we framed you, eh? Tell me, did we cast some spell as well? I could just lay on a bench. No trouble in my head. And sleep whenever I want. Answer to no one. You're free to go whenever you want. Wherever you want. No one holds you back, don't worry. No one. But know this. That wherever you go... To Australia, to Germany even if you go... you'll still be a worker, eh. You'll still be a waiter, eh. In a factory or a dishwasher, to make ends meet. What are we then, those of us that work? Animals? Go away then! Leave! [But I told you.] [I'm not a contractor. If I was...] [700 they tell me...] [And if you say a thing "My boy, you're no good"] ["I don't fancy you is all"] [Pay me or get your money outta here...] Come over. Yes, now. You hear? Get your things as well, everything. Spare me the excuses and the whining. No, no. Come here and we'll figure it out. Sitting there all by yourself... Wait, listen... On second thought... Aristides will come get you. Yes, I'm sending him over right now. OK, bye... A word... He stabbed her 20 times then killed himself, did you read that? A quick word... Come here already! - You're ready? - Yes. OK, let's go. Long time no see, where have you been? All is good. What about your husband? I never see him. Away on a trip, he'll be back. Bye. A trip? OK, bye, so long. Yes? Yes, she's here. Yes? How are you? It's me, how are you? - So, are you coming back? - To do what? You're no one's slave, isn't that what you said? You can't be a waiter. Why should I serve you then, eh? Let it go, Mimi. It's better that you left now. It's for the best to break up now. While it's still early. I didn't get that, that thing you said. What's all that? Who got in your brain? We never spoke two words between us. Isn't that so? I'm a human too, you know. And I also want to laugh someday, you hear? Was that a marriage? Who are you? What are you? Three days work and you gave up. That's another story. Quit it or you'll hear it. As you wish... YOU think about it, OK? Bye. What are you looking at? What did I do now? Nothing. You just got thirsty and got up to have some water. Have a go, you'll wake up the kids. Ma! I'm used to it, but why should they have to pay for this madness? [Mother: I heard the phone.] [Nitsa: It's their business.] [indistinct quarrel] [Mother: Do you understand?] [Nitsa: And what's it with you?] [Nitsa: Their business, like it or not.] [Nitsa: If you don't like it, you can leave.] [Mother: Shut me in an old people's home then.] [Nitsa: You're getting on my nerves!] What do you want ma? Nothing, I'm just saying he could be going around with any slut. [Nitsa: His business!] [Mother: It's adultery! Adultery! ] Now you've done it! Disturbing the whole neighbourhood with your problems, eh? Don't you hear? Go and calm it down. It will calm down on its own, don't you start now. So we're gonna make the headlines... the way you're going with it, right? And kill each other. They don't solve differences like that, you know. There is a civilized way, not with quarrels and stabbings. ...So we thought I should come instead, you understand? To talk like men and settle this thing. If you mess with women, there is no end to it. I don't really get it, but... Anyway. What does she want from me? So you don't get it, eh? Which part? She sent you to settle this and bollocks. She could have told me herself. I never cursed at her or beat her. Who is she afraid of? You left her though, right? That's what she says. That's why she packed and came to us. If that's not it, I don't get it man. Unless there's something else going on, eh? Could be. Give me something then. - So you don't know? - No, honestly. Me neither. I'm serious and you're making fun of me, eh? I get pissed when they're mocking me. You're the one mocking me Aristides! When you look for things that didn't happen. That are between me and my wife. She's my WIFE. If we were not friends, I wouldn't even bother. Even if you bulged your eyes out. But I brought you home and, in the end.... In the end, what? - I disgraced it, is what you're saying? - I don't mean that. But I won't be the one being accused here. Did I ever accuse you Aristides for bringing me from the village to do business? Did I ever say a thing? - That's another matter. - It's not. It's the same matter Aristides and don't play fool now. And never did I even mention about the money I spent on furniture, ovens and sewing machines. And I never asked for any dowry, you get it? No one should step into my family matters. I married my wife because I wanted her the way she is. If she wants to settle anything, then here. Here, in her home. And I tell you, the way things are, she's not coming back. You said, what does she say? That's what she said. "If it is like that, it's better to break up", she said. Ultimatum then. Toula said, then sent you, to tell me... And she's now waiting for an answer, eh? How else then, Mimi? The civilized way... Just married, now divorced. We just have to find the best way. You and me. Deal. No problem, the way you deal with it. I deal with it? Now leave me out of it, OK? OK man. If she wants a divorce and never see me again... By all means! Make the arrangements with a lawyer and call me when to sign. - Are you OK man? - I'm fine. Just wanted to see you, have a talk. You did well. Unless you're busy, that is... No man. Listen, shall we have a coffee and catch up? So, Mr. Zorbas, we won't need to go to court at all? I told you, but you didn't listen. What I know is these things take time. Look. If the husband agrees to sign the statement.... Of course these procedures take time. Applications, show up, the church and so on. But, basically, these are typical matters. What kind of court did you expect? How should I know? You're the lawyer here... So let me settle the case. What is there to worry about? I mean, if you need anything in detail... Now calm down. All together, calmly, will sort this out. Alright? Come in. - The husband, right? - Yes, that's right. Have a seat. Please, wherever you want. We won't be long, OK? I gather you've been informed on the details. Yes, well... I spoke to Aristides. Good. Take a look here please. And if you agree.... I sign and... we get the divorce, right? I'll take care of the rest. You won't have to do a thing. I see... I have a question Mr. Zorbas... Suppose I don't want to divorce my wife... Do I still have to sign this paper? No one's forcing you, you agreed to this. Please now. Because I gave it some more thought. And what I'm saying is... I'd like to state that... I don't want to divorce my wife. Now, if she insists, she can say it right here. First her, then me. What is this? You left her. This is called Abandonment or Desertion. Do you even know the law? [Lawyer: Come now, please...] "Do you know the law"... Why don't you ask her first? I never wanted to divorce you, that was not my intention. But then you left and now we're here. We could just... talk it over. And say what, same all... No. I wanted to tell you it was my mistake to leave home like that. And that I decided that I want to stay with you. And lots more. What more? I got a job. And I even have health insurance now. I'm thinking about bringing my ma over, now that she has no one... You want to discuss this here? Couldn't you tell me all this earlier? Did we have to get to the court? That's alright... We pay for the lawyer and... we get going. Will you come home now? [♪ Vicky Moscholiou: "Xenihtisa Stin Porta Sou"] ♪ Life is a prison, with walls all around ♪ ♪ It is the music of pain, the lyrics of solitude ♪ ♪ I spent all night at your doorstep and softly I sing ♪ ♪ Heaven is here and Hell is here as well ♪ ♪ I spent all night at your doorstep and softly I sing ♪ [♪ Heaven is here and Hell is here as well ♪] You tiptoe around the same subject now, don't you? Not me man, that's the way it is. Let me put it this way. Everything is politics. Why, what did you think politics is? If you know who you are, who are the others. You know what you live for. You know your rights. What to fight for. That is all. If we lived well, would there be any reason to fight? Alright. You know some things, what about the rest? You yourself have been through high school, right? Nah, until 5th grade, then I quit. What is there to learn? Alright, until 5th grade. You can sit by yourself, to learn, to read. At home. If you want to? You may be right... But when to do all that... The world is changing, friend. They've built hotels on your fields. And nowadays, they grow tomatoes with injections, OK? Now, you left your village... Because you didn't want to earn less. You were used to being your own boss, right? So now what? My man, you and I, all that we have... Is our bare hands and some brains. This is what we have to live by. And you know what's more? We should be happy even in our misery. We have to be optimistic I mean. If you don't bite your teeth. If you don't believe this society can change. If you don't fight for change. To change for the benefit of the whole, right? Not for the few. Then you'll end up like the guy there that plays mad. Not just you, all of us... [Banner: Raise 40% / 40-hour work / Indexation adjustment] Fellow-workers, there's no reason to talk about the same things. We all know our problems. And all of us workers know what austerity means. And what price index means. And on this indexation adjustment issue... We have already agreed upon. But what I'm here to discuss, is an issue of substance... You go too long fellow-worker, please get on with it. I do not go too long Mr chairman. The fellow-worker here, just before... You have to let me finish. [When you try to talk...] [If you don't make clear...] [To clear out the relationship...] [Between hotel staff and any company...] It's like you're trying to cover up... - What are you saying... - Fellow-worker... - This is a distortion... - Fellow-worker... - I didn't mean it like that. - Pardon me. You know too well that we don't need... Too much theoretical education to understand what our problems are. And you know even better. What it is like to struggle every day. - To pay for your rent. - We know all that. - And feed your family. - Don't get political. Fellow-workers! Fellow-workers! We were called by the board here today... To decide on the problems of the union. It's not politics, I'm being very specific. This whole thing is shameful! - Please. - Are we here to chat? - Let's go on with the voting, please. - You talk politics all the time. Do not interrupt me! There is a chairman! [Big deal, we'll settle this between us...] [indistinct chatter] [Parties are not the problem, quite the opposite] [Come now, same outcome all over again.] [We still have to ask for it, right?] [indistinct chatter] [They'll get thrown out of work like that.] [Right? Do they have to answer to anyone?] [Strike] [Please be quiet and get on with it.] [Whoever agrees with the first proposal, raise your hand] [One, two, three, four...] [Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. eleven...]
