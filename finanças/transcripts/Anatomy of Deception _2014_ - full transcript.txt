Detective Briggs, I know you're watching. Your heart yearning and praying that I will relent and let your sister go. But alas, I cannot. Like you, I must do my duty. You should not have meddled in my affairs! My children, you will come to understand that those who deem to have power over us are merely flesh and bone. And for us to rise, - Please! No, no. - They must be crushed! (computer beeping) (ominous music) (machine beeping) (tool clanking) No! It's not your time yet! I need you! (alarm beeping) - [Police] Police! We got a search warrant! (police chattering) - On your knees now! - Olivia? What did you do?! - [Williams] On the ground now! - What did you do?! Olivia? (gun firing) No! (thudding) Olivia, oh my god! - Briggs! Briggs, no! - Oh my god! Oh my god, oh my god! - Leave her, get away! - Oh my god, Olivia! - Briggs, get away! - No! - Medic! (somber music) Listen to me. Let go. - No, no! (chill music) - Jack Myers surprisingly survived a gunshot to the face. Surgeons at St. Joe's say he will lose his left eye but his quick recovery is due to a nerve disorder called Sensory Autonomic Neuropathy. Jack Myers feels no pain so his body never went into shock. Which, according to the lead surgeon who wishes to remain anonymous, saved his life. For more coverage, let's go to Hanson Tillman at the hospital. - The Kaos killer also known as Jack Myers has chosen to represent himself. He's a computer programmer with a law degree from the Vegas Online School of Law. His specialty is video surveillance and he is a licensed private investigator in the Los Angeles area. - Detective Frank Williams was promoted today by Mayor Sanchez to Chief of Police. Let's go live to Lisa who's got the story. - I believe this town is safe again thanks to the efforts of our newly appointed Chief of Police Williams and our outstanding police force. Chief? (crowd applauding) - Thank you so much. First of all I'd like to personally thank Mayor Sanchez, and I'd like to say as a servant to the public that being appointed to this office is my first small step on a long ladder that I intend to climb. - And again, another surprising turn of events as Jack Myers uncovers that the search warrant for his rural home located in the hills of Santa Clarita was in fact filled out wrong. The address was for the neighbor's home. This brings Chief Williams under fire yet again. - And a new development today in what the people have termed the Kaos case, Jack Myers has filed a lawsuit against the city and Chief of Police Frank Williams. DA Genna Knowles calls this a ploy. - Jack Myers will not be set free. He's a murderer. We know he's a murderer and I will do everything in my power for him to not walk these streets again. Excuse me. (reporters talking over each other) - In another strange twist of events, the search warrant that was thought to be flawed was in fact correct. The DA's office claims that Jack had an accomplice hack the court's computers. - The search warrant always had the correct address on it. This was a premeditated ploy by Jack Myers which did not work. That's all I have to say, thank you. - [Reporter] Can we just have one more question? - That's all I have. - [Reporter] How did Jack Myers pull it off- - Jack Myers pleads insanity and requests that he be evaluated. The judges delayed the trial and sent him to Acres Mental Institution for what some say will be a yearlong evaluation. This is yet another delay in the case against Jack Myers who killed 20 young women including Olivia Briggs, sister of Detective Alison Briggs. (particles zooming) - 14 months ago, notorious serial killer Jack Myers AKA the Kaos killer was captured. Now, in two weeks, he's gonna stand trial for those crimes. I've invited on the only person to be alone in a room with this man and live. Let's welcome Dr. Marissa Sanderson. (crowd applauding) So, you determined that he's sane. - Well I'm not sure sane is the correct term because sane is very relative. Most people would consider the, - Hey, kiddo. All right, what do you think, which one? These or these? - Those, definitely those. - Yeah, you're right. - Voices, or have other manifestations of schizophrenia causing him to do this. What he has is a message. - What's the message? What is he trying to say? - Jack considers himself a vigilante of sorts. He's a warrior. - Are you gonna send him to jail? - Huh? - He stands for chaos and destruction. - And in this world that we live in, do you think he's successful? - Well he certainly has gotten a lot of people's attention, wouldn't you agree? - [TV Host] I would. - Did you finish your homework? - Not yet. Do I have to go to Steve and Lindy's? - Yes. - I'm 13, practically an adult. Carrie's mom lets her. - I don't care what Carrie's mom lets her do. I'm your mother and I'm not letting you stay home alone. - (scoffs) Whatever. (Genna sighing) (rock music) ♪ Lovely things in my hand (phone ringing) - Hey, sweety. - Zack, where are you? It's the Mayor's ball tonight. - Tonight? Ah, I'm sorry, I can't. I thought that was next week. - Zack, you know this is really important to me. - Well, my job's important to me as well, Genna. You're not the only one with a career. - When are you gonna be home? - Later? You'll probably be asleep. Bye. - Bye. (crickets chirping) (sighing) (doorbell dinging) (door creaking) Bye, sweety. Thank you so much for doing this, Lindy. I'll see you guys later. - Okay, have a good night! (light haughty music) (crowd chattering) - DA Knowles, can I get a comment from you about Jack Myers? - No, Chelsea, I'm off the clock. - Come on, please give me something. - Sorry, not tonight. (crowd applauding) - Thank you. Thank you so much, thank you. Well as we enter the election year, we all have some choices to make. Ballots to cast, babies to kiss. (crowd chuckling) However, this will be the last ball that I host as mayor. (crowd awing) Oh, not because I'd lose. (crowd laughing) But I plan on retiring. However, I would like to announce a recommendation for my replacement. We may not share the same political party, but do not hold that against her. She has continually supported the mayor's office and she has made our city a better place to live. I wholeheartedly endorse Genna Knowles, our District Attorney for the next mayor. (crowd applauding) - Wow. I didn't expect this. I am honored and just a little bit surprised. Mayor, I will certainly give it some serious thought. (crowd applauding) (jazzy music) - You know, I really hope you would consider it. - Thank you for the endorsement, Mayor, but I wish you would have talked to me about it. I'm just not sure that I'm ready for that. - Oh, you are. - Genna. Congratulations. You know Mike, it would have been nice if you would have talked to me about this as well. I'd put in for my candidacy last weekend you know, for our party. - You're not right for the job, I told you that. - You're supposed to follow party lines. Hanson talked to you about that. - You make too many mistakes, Fred. And you nearly put a killer back on the street all because of an address mistake. - There was never a mistake, Mike. He had someone hack into the courthouse's website. - Don't forget I saw the original warrant. And I understand doing what it takes. You're lucky I didn't rip that police badge right off your chest. Hanson can kiss my ass. Please, think about it. Good night. - So, you're really gonna do this, huh? - I don't know. Maybe I should. - Excuse me. Genna, can I get a few words about the recommendation from the Mayor? - Sure, Chelsea. I'd be happy to. - Williams. (tense music) Do you have a minute to talk about the campaign? - [Frank] (sighing) Yeah. Yeah, sure. - My company would be happy to donate if you can guarantee a tax incentive. They'll provide resources and company. (cars whooshing) (hinge creaking) - Genna. Saw you on the news again last night, pretty cool. You know, mayor. - Oh yeah, you know I figured, why not give it a shot? You know, my family is very supportive. - This is for you. - Oh, thanks, Ethan, you didn't have to do that. - Tall skinny vanilla latte, right? - You got it. - Hey, how's your computer working? Is it okay now? - Oh yeah, it's great. Yeah, thanks so much for fixing it. You know, technology's never been my forte. - Well, can't be an expert in everything, right? - No, Ethan, you can't. - Well I guess I better get back down to the crypt. - The crypt? - It's what we call the server room. It's where we keep all the computers. - Ah. Well, I'll see if we can't get you an office with a window. - Oh no, I like it down there. You know, dark. - Okay. (elevator dinging) Thanks again, Ethan. - Yeah. Yeah. (tense music) - [Guard] Hey. - What? - Monitor two isn't working. You wanna fix this? - Yeah, sure. - We're all super excited for you, Mayor. - [Genna] Thank you, Amber. Were there any calls for me? - Yeah, lots. - Any that count? - Not really. - Genna. The test results from the Harper case came back negative. - Really? - Yeah. - I wasn't expecting that. - Yeah, me either. I mean he's guilty, everyone knows it. - You're probably right, Lydia. But maybe this time, he wasn't. - But you know that's ridiculous. I have every aspect of this case locked up. This was supposed to be the final nail in his coffin! - What's the jury demographic? - 50-50. - You let the defense have a 50-50 split? Dammit, Lydia. I told you to get more women on this jury than men. I was very specific. I said more women than men. This means nothing to a woman. She sees a defendant crying on the stand, point her finger and say "He raped me." This means everything to a man. Do you understand that? - Yes. But the jury selection took two weeks. - It should have been three. If you blow this one, I'm gonna have to let you go. - Are you serious? - I'm sorry, Lydia. We put bad guys away, not let them skate on technicalities. Amber, can you get me Police Chief Williams on the phone please? - [Amber] Sure. - Thank you. (sighing) DA Genna Knowles announces her candidacy. - [Amber] The Chief's on line one. - Thank you, Amber. Chief Williams? - [Frank] I'm reading the headlines. - Another time. Listen, I need you to go in and testify against Jack Myers on Thursday. - [Frank] I was scheduled for Tuesday. - I know, but I need you to go in after Detective Briggs, back her up. Chief? - [Frank] (sighing) Seeya Thursday. (phone clicking) (Genna scoffing) - Zack? - Mmm, that smells delicious. - You were really late getting home last night. - Oh, we made our deadline for the Vanderbilt building and they loved it! - Babe. Did you see the morning paper? - Who reads the paper? - Don't be a jerk. - (laughing) I'm teasing. Mila brought it in. So does that make me the first man? - Ha, very funny. I'm serious, you haven't been answering my calls all day. - It's exciting. (doorbell dinging) - I'll get it. - Who's that? - It's Jeff, my campaign advisor. - Oh, great, how much does he cost? - Calm down, the caucus is paying for it. - [Zack] Oh, good. - Mom, it's some guy for you. - Thanks, honey. - [Zack] How's my basketball superstar? - Only in the starting squad. - That's my girl! Hey, game's on. - Homework first. (ominous music) (siren blaring in distance) (radio chatter) - So did you tell your family you were driving me today? - No. Never mind about my family. - Didn't mention it? - [Mike] Why should I? Just another day at the office, buddy. - I think not. (honking) - Come on, let's go! - Are you in some kind of hurry? - Yeah, I am. (revving) (vehicle honking) - No! (crashing) - Oh, morning. - Hey, Justin. - I saw a paper yesterday. Some big stuff happening for you, it's exciting. - Yeah, yeah, it's been interesting. How's the hospital? - Busy. Busy, I'm working ER now. - I imagine that would be busy. - Hey, Justin. - Zack. Good morning. Have a good day. - Bye. - Phone's for you. - Hello? - It was a hit and run. We haven't found the other driver yet. (somber music) - [Intercom] (beeping) Paging Dr. Bender. Paging Dr. Bender please. - Here. Up your nostrils. We did it at Marine Corps. Helps. - I think I'm okay. - Suit yourself. - Ah, good. - What is it, Doc? - These are Jack's old dental records. And this is his. From the look of it, that there is Jack Myers. He's dead. - I'd like a DNA sample run. - Takes two weeks unless you want to expedite. Costs more. - You know what Doc, no rush. Well, it looks like my Thursday just opened up. (light music) - This was your big case. - Yep. Jack Myers, AKA the Kaos Killer. Big launching platform. - Your what? - Oh, nothing, just, something my campaign chairman came up with last night. - I have the paperwork the judge sent over dismissing the case due to his passing. - He's dead, Amber. It's probably better this way. - Have a good night. - Sure.

(dance music) Oh my god. - Did you call me? - No. Yes. Don't let anyone touch that computer.

An email, Zack? 14 years of marriage and you send me an email? How could you do that? - I never sent an email. Let alone post this. Somebody got into my phone. - I want you to pack your bags. I want you out by the time I get home. - Like you're any better than me. - That was a long time ago. - He still lives down the damn street, Genna! - Justin was a mistake, Zack. 'Cause you weren't around! It should never have happened, we talked about this! We worked through it. - No, you worked through it! I never did. - I trusted you. (Zack sighing) (smoke hissing) - And when we come back, I'll show you how to make chorizo tacos on It's All In How You Rub It. - Gotta go, basketball practice. - [Genna] What, I'm making you a hot breakfast. - What's this, a lawyer? But you're already a lawyer. - It's a different kind of lawyer, baby. It's like seeing a foot doctor when I'm a brain surgeon. - Are you and Dad getting a divorce? - I don't know. - I wish you'd just make up your mind. - Sweety. (urgent music) - [Reporter] We interrupt your regularly scheduled program with a late-breaking news story. We believe a member of the DA's office has been found dead. - Briggs, - Detective Briggs! - [Reporter] May we have a question? Did you find Lydia Mannor? - Yes. The body we found was Lydia Mannor. - [Reporter] We understand that she was found in the kill room like the Kaos Killer would use. - [Alison] Who told you that? - Is it true, do we have a copycat killer? - Where are you getting- - The answer's no, it's just some sick person who has no respect for human life. - We heard it was a copycat killer. Will you give your word, we have more questions! (tense music) - Yes, I'd like to see the photos as soon as possible. Look, Lydia was on my staff. If there's a copycat killer, I'm gonna be able to help. I knew everything about Jack Myers. Okay. Thanks, Briggs. (light music) (sobbing) Dammit. Hey. - You okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. - Heard about Zack and the video. - Yeah. - You know, after Claire passed I used to come to this bench? Sometimes for hours. - Yeah well, it's a good spot. - Right? - I have to go. - Hey, next time you wanna go running, call me. Maybe we can go further down the path. - Sure. It'll be just like old times. (equipment humming) Hello? - Genna. Hey, what are you doing down here? - Well, I thought I would come down and check out the crypt. - Home sweet home. - Cozy. Listen, I'm really sorry that I raced out of my office so quickly last night. It's just been a very strange week. - Yeah. Crazy about Lydia, huh? Dead. - Yeah. So I got a couple of emails in my inbox last night, and I can't find them anywhere this morning. - Did you check your spam folder? Sometimes things get lost. - Is it possible for somebody to get into my computer and change things around? - Depends, maybe. If you want I can come take a look. - Yeah, that'd be great. Also, are you able to transfer over these Jack Myers tapes so I can watch them on my iPad? - Wow, those are old school. - Yeah. So is it possible? - Sure. - Great, thanks, Ethan. (Genna sighing) - Of course. Your wish is my command. - Enjoy your whatever. - Ah, Genna. I thought you were taking some time off. - Yeah, I can't, with Lydia's... Did Briggs leave an envelope for me? - Yeah, it just came. - Oh. Thanks, Amber. - [Alison] This guy was very skilled. The wounds were made with a medical knife and then a bone saw. We still haven't found the right hand. - Did he stream the murder online? - [Alison] No. He used older cameras not capable of broadcast. He left the cameras but took the tapes. (computer chiming) - [Genna] What is he playing at? - [Alison] What? - Nothing. - [Alison] Look, this guy is nothing like Kaos. He's sloppy, leaving fingerprints and hair samples. (computer chiming) We've already got him on the database and we're performing a search. - What the hell? - [Alison] Excuse me? - Um, nothing. You know, I do have interview tapes of Jack Myers when he was at Acres. I was gonna use them for evidence but, you know, he did talk a lot about his fans. I'm gonna go through the tapes and see if I can find any clues. - [Alison] That would help. Also, we can access his medical records. (computer chiming) Mainly the records at Arbor. - Son of a bitch. - [Alison] Are you okay? - Yeah, Briggs, can I call you back? - [Alison] Sure. (Lydia sobbing) - Oh my god. Amber, I need you to get Briggs back on the phone now! I'll hold. - [Amber] Right away. - Who hurts you? - Please, please, please, please, please, please. - Who hurts you?! (Lydia crying) - [Alison] Briggs here. - Get to the news station right now. Lydia's video's on their website and it's about to go live! - [Killer] Who hurts you?! - Genna! (Lydia screaming) Genna? (Lydia screaming) - What? - [Alison] Genna, are you there? - [Killer] Who hurts you?! - Genna Knowles! She hurts me! (Lydia screaming) - Oh, oh my! Dammit! (fire crackling) (siren blaring in distance) - What the hell is going on out there? - [Genna] I don't know. - The media's going wild on this. - Look, I'll talk to Jeff. We'll figure it out. I mean, we can put a spin on this. - A spin? One of your staff is dead and the last thing she said was your name. You sure got someone upset. (phone ringing) Yes? Okay. - What's wrong? (tense music) - That was Detective Briggs. They have a fingerprint match. The fingerprints are yours. - So your husband- - We're separated. - Put a camera in your room and sent you a video of you in the shower? - Yes. It was right before I received the email of Lydia's... - You wanna file a complaint against him? - Have someone check my iPad. There's an email in there from someone named GennaLover. Maybe you can trace this back to whoever this was. - GennaLover? - Yes. - We're gonna assume for now that the hair sample we just took from you is also a match to the one we found on the scene. - And why would you do that? - Besides your husband, was there anyone else that you may have recently had some sort of altercation with? - Like the both of you, I've put away a lot of people who want to hurt me. Do you have any suspects? - Besides you? - I'm a suspect? - I'd like to go through your past cases and compare them with recent parolees. - Okay. - I'll have the guy check this out. - Look, we have nothing except this link to you. You were right. He's good, just like you suspected. Nothing left behind that wasn't planted. So if you're wondering if I think you had anything to do with Lydia's death, know the answer is no, I don't. - Thank you. - Genna. I'm sorry to hear about Lydia. I understand she was from your office. - Yes, she was. - Are you really gonna do this? - Do what? - Well, before the Kaos killer case, I mean it would have made sense to run for mayor, but, you know now, I'm not so sure. - And why is that? - Well, you know, with Zack's recent infidelity, it just doesn't look too good. - Considering who I'm running against, I'd look like a saint. - Miss Knowles. My guys couldn't find any recent videos from a GennaLover. - What? That doesn't make any sense. - Yeah, we checked deleted messages, history, scanned the drive. There's nothing there. - I don't understand. How can something just disappear? - I'm sure you've been under a lot of stress lately with... Let me know if there's anything else. - Well Genna, just think it over. - Genna, this is just so much. I don't even know what to say. I'm so sorry. It's a lot. - Thanks. Thanks, Lindy, appreciate it. - I don't get it. Why would Zack send those emails? - I don't know. I mean he's trying to get custody of Kiera. I just, I don't understand why he would go about it this way. You know what I mean? - What did the police say? - Couldn't find anything. No video, no email, nothing. It just doesn't make any sense. - (scoffing) It's all... It's just so strange. Strange. Oh, um... I'm sorry Genna, I can't stay. Steve and I have plans, so I have to head out. - Okay. How about you and Steve come by sometime this week for dinner? - Sure, Genna, maybe next week. - That'll be perfect. (phone ringing) - [Kiera] Hey, it's Kiera. I can't come to the phone right now but if you leave a message I'll get back to you as soon as I can. - Hey Kiera, it's Mom, again. Still waiting for you to call me back. So call me back, okay? I love you. (tense music) (water splashing) (operatic singing) (machine beeping) - [Marissa] Please state your name. - Jackson Myers. But please, call me Kaos. - [Marissa] Why Kaos? - Conformity is predictable. Chaos allows for infinite possibilities, paths, some would say. Society likes conformity. Imagine if you will, a recurring episode of Cheers. Same place, same time, same people. Everyone knows your name. Nothing to fear. With chaos, there's always fear. - Fear is very important to you. - It's the power of the unknown. - [Marissa] And you want that power. - Don't I already have it? Isn't that why we are here? Fear is control. (alarm blaring) (intense music) - Lindy, someone's been in my house. Can I use your phone? - Yeah. - Briggs, it's Genna. Hi, I'm sorry, I know it's late. Listen. - She is really terrified. - Paranoid sounds more like it. I'm going back to bed. - Steve! (tense music) Please don't tell Zack. - You don't tell me what to do. Zack's my friend, and she, she's nuts. - There's no sign of anybody breaking in. We scanned the bathroom. If there's a camera in there, I don't know where. - Are you sure you looked everywhere? - I skipped the panty drawer. - (sighing) This doesn't make any sense. (phone ringing) - Pratt here. Okay, I'm on my way. I'm gonna leave a man out front just in case. You have a good night. - Thank you. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm just, just a little shaken up. - What's going on? - It's a long story. - Look if you, I mean if you need a place to stay, you know that- - Justin, it's fine, thank you. - Yeah. (tires screeching) - Oh god. - (laughing) Look at you two, huh? Happy couple! - Zack, what are you doing here? - I was out celebrating our victory when Steve called, so I came over, but, it seems you've already got some help. Hello, Justin. - Zack. - I'm not even out, what, two weeks and you're already moving in? - Zack, he was just checking in, the alarm got tripped. - Yeah, I'm sure that's it. - Look, maybe you should go. - You know what, Justin? It's gonna be unreal the amount of guilt you must carry every day knowing the affair that you had with my wife killed Claire. (bashing) - Zack! Justin, stop it! - No, no, no, it's okay, officer. We're just playing here. For now. I'm watching both of you. - Jenna, I'm sorry, it's just- - Justin. Please, I have to go. (tense music) (door creaking and shutting) (music intensifying) - Mom! (scoffing) Don't do that, you scared me. - What are you doing? - What does it look like I'm doing? I'm going to live with Dad. - What, why? - 'Cause Dad says he has a judge that says I have to live with him. Here. This is from Dad. - Kiera, he can't just do that. - [Kiera] I gotta go. - [Genna] Kiera, wait! - Mom, I gotta go. - Kiera, stop! Zack, what the hell are you doing? You can't just take her away from me! - Yeah, those are the papers we had signed this morning by Judge Reinhart. I have temporary full custody. Hostile environment. - Hostile environment?! Zack! (car revving) Hey, you really think these things are gonna work, Ethan? - They should do the job. You know, I've seen a few of those shows where they put cameras up, they usually find it's the ex-husband who's behind everything. Then again, I'm surprised nobody's bothered you before, you being the DA and all. - Hey, thanks for coming out on a Saturday. - Hey, you got it. One down. State of the art. - Yeah, and it cost about as much as a Picasso. Hmm, spy on the neighbors too. - Cool, huh? - Yeah. - You don't have any conspicuous files and your firewall is working. - So how did they do it then? - Well, Genna. Hacking isn't so much a science as it is an art. Whoever did this had mad skills. - Like Kaos? - No. Kaos, there are very few people like him. Three years, he hid behind a variable IP. Do you have any idea the math behind that? If I had half of his skills, - You know he's a murderer, right? - Nobody's perfect. (laughing) It was a bad joke. (keyboard clacking) - Hey, thank you so much again, Ethan. I really appreciate this. - Hey, I was thinking maybe we could go out sometime. - Oh. You mean like on a date? - Yeah. - Ethan, I'm really not ready for anything soon. - No, I meant like friends, coffee. - Yeah, for sure. (tense music) My treat. - I mean it's not like it's a big thing. - Okay, well, thanks again. - Yeah, thank you again. (girls laughing) (rock music) - You guys are bad. I can't, oh, sorry. Brad's waiting for me at home. - Your loss. We'll miss you. - I'm sorry. - Seeya. - [Amber] Take a shot for me. - Bye. - Maybe we will! - Mmm. (tense music) (gasping) Ah, I didn't see you. Scared me, Jesus. (phone chiming) (tense music) (music intensifying) (Amber screaming) - [Marissa] You talk about your fans as though they were children. - Why do you suppose that military leaders recruit children to fight their armies? Children are a blank slate. Easily molded, easily led even to their deaths. - [Marissa] So you consider them an army? - No, no, no, my dear doctor. I need no considerations. My fans are an army. Even as I sit here and enjoy my time with you they plan, they scheme, they make ready. - [Marissa] Ready? Ready for what? - One day the pillars of conformity will come crashing down. Chaos empowered. Then, my dear doctor, you and I will have a different conversation. (ominous music) One of pain. (Amber whimpering) (phone ringing) - [Alison] Detective Briggs. - Briggs, he's got her. - [Alison] Who? - Amber, please. She's online, I don't know the website. - [Killer] Come on, Genna. You're smarter than that. - He can hear me. - [Killer] And see you. - Briggs, check the old website for Kaos. - [Killer] Now you're thinking. - [Alison] We've locked that site. - Please, just do it. Don't you dare hurt her! (Amber whimpering) - [Alison] Oh my god Genna, you're right. We can see and hear you as well. - Can you see? - Oh my god. - Can you trace it? - [Killer] I declare war on the District Attorney's office for crimes of hate. (bell tolling) Tampering with evidence. (Amber whimpering) (bell tolling) Bribery. (bell tolling) Corruption. (bell tolling) And murder! (Amber screaming) - Stop, stop it! Stop! (somber music) (phone slamming) Have they found her yet? - No. What do you know about Ethan Fisher? - Well he's a network Admin. I don't think he... there's just no way. - Do you know his current location? - No, but why? You know what, Ethan actually helped me put the cameras in my home. - And has access to your computers? Get one of our guys to pick him up. - Right. - I don't think he's capable of this. (phone ringing) - Briggs. Okay. We found Amber. (somber music) He had this whole thing set up. - Kaos loved the attention. Putting on a big show. This. This I've never understood why. - After he killed my sister I used to ask myself the same question. - Did you find an answer? - No. - I'd like to ask you a favor. Can you have a man watch my daughter and Zack please? If he can get to me, he can get to them. - You know things would have been a lot better if you and Williams hadn't tampered with that warrant? Left Jack Myers out on the street. So I could have had one last shot. - Doesn't matter now because he's dead. - But we didn't win, Genna. Now somebody else is killing in his name and he gets to live on a martyr. Of course, we'll have someone watch them. - Hey, Justin. Hey, what are you doing here? - I wanted to check on you. - Oh, I'm okay. - Do they know who's doing this? - No. I saw her. Dammit. - Hey, hey. - I'm gonna go inside. (doorbell dinging) Lindy? - What do you want, Genna? - Nothing, I've been calling and calling you. You haven't been answering. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. - I've been sick. - Okay. Do you need anything? - Just some rest. - All right, well let me know, okay? - Okay, thank you. - Sorry about the mess. Pratt asked us to be thorough. - It's okay. Is my bedroom okay? - Yeah, we swept it. Found this. Tricky little bugger. It's optics are set so when you look for it it throws you way off. That's why you thought it might be a light bulb unit but it was drilled in the ceiling. - Okay. Thank you. - Yeah. (suspenseful music) - Looks like a new phone. - Yeah, Dad bought it for me. - [Genna] So how's school? - I hate school. - Okay. - So are you guys really getting a divorce? - Kiera, look, there's some stuff that your Dad and I need to sort out. Sometimes- - Spare me the sermon, Mom. I've already heard it all from Dad. - So how are things over there with your dad? - We have a pool and a weight room. It's pretty cool. - Actually I meant how are things between you and your dad? - Well he keeps going out with Steve all the time. They go for a beer and watch stupid football. - Look, Kiera. There are some stuff that I need to sort out, some legal stuff to get custody of you. Once I figure all of that out you're gonna be able to come back home, okay? - What if I don't want to come back home? - Well, when the time is right- - What? - Kiera, living with your father is just temporary. - I'm not living with Justin. - Whoah, who said anything about Justin? - Dad. And he also said I'm old enough to decide where I wanna live. - Yes. - It's my choice. - Yes, Kiera, you're right, it is your choice. And I don't know what your dad's telling you but there's nothing going on between me and Justin. Do you understand that? - Whatever. (somber music) - Your dad home? - Maybe. - Kiera. Hey, listen. I need you to lock the doors behind you and never let anyone in, okay? - Dad told me about someone's after you. He also told me about the cop. - So you understand then. - Sure. - Hey. Briggs, what are you doing here? - I got an email from you saying you wanted to show me something. - I didn't send you any email. (gunshots pinging) - Is that normal? - No. (tense music) Hello? Police. - Lindy, are you home? (ominous music) - [Lindy] Steve? (static hissing) - [Killer] Good evening, Genna. I have brought you here to demonstrate the power of suggestion. Lindy has been abused by Steve since high school. She's gotten very good at hiding it. (Steve coughing) - Oh, thank god. Hey, get me down from this. Please, hurry. - She's accepted him even though he does not accept her. - Where are they? - I don't know. (Steve grunting) - It's locked! Somebody help us! Please! Somebody, please help us, somebody! - Turn the TV down. - [Lindy] Somebody! - Oh my god, stay here! They're here! - Lindy! - [Lindy] Please help us, somebody! Please help us! Somebody! - Here! - [Lindy] Please help us! - Lindy! - Somebody's at the door. Go open it, baby. - [Killer] How many times will you let him hurt you? - Who said that? (ominous music) - Briggs, he's in there with them! - Open the door! - [Killer] Every night you fear him coming home drunk. Then you powder the pain away. Your bruises covered yet painful. - I love you. Baby, just... - [Alison] Lindy! - Just go open the door, please. - How do you know that? - [Killer] I've been watching you, Lindy. - I promise I'll never hurt you again. - [Killer] You know that's a lie. - Baby, don't listen to him. I love you. - [Killer] You've heard it all before! Lies. (Alison knocking) All you have to do, Lindy, is nothing and your life will change forever. (Steve grunting) (Steve screaming) - Open the door. - [Killer] All you have to do, Lindy, is nothing. (tense music) (dramatic airy music intensifying) (gun firing) (calm music) - She did a good thing. Opening that door took guts. That guy didn't expect it. - So he got away? - Through a window. But he left shoe prints. He's getting sloppy. - He wants to get caught. - And he will at some point. (jeep revving) (somber music) (knocking) (Genna sobbing) - Drink this, you'll feel better. - Thank you. - Mhmm. How's Steven? - Ah, he separated his shoulders and dislocated his knee, but I think he'll be okay. - I'm gonna stay for a bit. - Justin, it's okay. I appreciate it but the police are gonna be outside all night, so. - You're exhausted. You need to sleep. - I just can't get it out of my mind. Justin. (passionate music) (lightly tense music) - I'll watch you. I promise. (somber music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Alison] Gen, it's Briggs. We found Ethan. - I'll be right down. - [Alison] See you soon. - [Genna] Where did you find him? - Hotel down on 5th street. Real rat trap. - He used his credit card to rent the room. - Has he talked? - No. But we found this on him. - Look, I know what you think but I- - Come on, Ethan. Look, we know you're pretty savvy with the tech and the things. - I know. I know that you wanna connect the dots and I know that they add up in some sort of way but I would never kill someone, come on! Why would I do that? - Lots of reasons, kid. Love, that's numero uno. - Love who? - Genna Knowles. - Genna's here? - [Alison] Why were you hiding out? - What are you talking about hiding out? - Come on, you're asking more questions than we are. Start making some sense! - Okay, okay, I was at the hotel, right. I was there seeing a friend. - Come on! - A woman, okay? I was there with a woman. I'm not the most popular guy. I either have to work really hard or I pay for it. (sighing) - And the mask? - I bought it on Ebay. It's a hot item. I figured that I could flip it to a friend. - You really think he did it? - No. - So you were home all day yesterday? - No, I was at the hotel. - How long? - It's expensive. I like to spend some time with her before- - Yeah, can she confirm this? - What, bring her here? - You call her, we meet her, she corroborates your story, you're free, it's simple. - She's a hooker! She doesn't talk to cops. - Well then I guess you're just up the creek. - We've got a team at your house right now, Ethan. What do you think they're gonna find? - Nothing, I didn't do anything. - [Frank] Look, do you wanna file charges? - Just wait and see what the team finds at his apartment. - Is Genna here? She'll tell you. Genna, tell them. - Hey, sit down! - Genna! - Lydia, Amber, those women are dead because of you, aren't they? Because you thought some freak in a mask was a hero? - I didn't kill anybody, I swear, I swear. I want a lawyer. - [Frank] Well, looks to me like you got your man. (Ethan sobbing) - Dammit, he's lying. - How do you know? - There's just something he's hiding. - Hold him for the full 24. Then question him again. With a lawyer if he wants. - We got another victim. (radio chatter) (siren blaring) (cameras clicking) Staff said they smelled something about seven p.m. They traced the smell down here, heard Dr. Sanderson calling for help. When they pried open the door, boom. It was a trap. Filled this place with propane. - The video? - It's already made internet history. A lot of wack jobs out there that like this kind of stuff. - When Dr. Sanderson was interviewing Kaos this was the exact room they were in every single time. - How many people have seen those tapes? - Just Dr. Sanderson and me. And Ethan. - Punk made copies. The mask wasn't the only thing he was selling. - This one was different. - What do you mean? - He's always required an audience but lately he's wanted you to witness every time he kills, even interact. Not this time. Well, psycho killers don't like change. They like a thread that runs through every kill. - So we need to see this video. - Help me! (screaming) (booming) - [Killer] Hello Genna, how I miss playing with you. Perhaps a date? - Is that it? - This skull thing spins for a bit, but yeah. - The end is an invitation. The thread's still intact. - And I'm next. - We're gonna hire a security specialist to shadow you. - Okay. First we need to talk with Ethan, find out who he sold those tapes to. - We can't. He asked for a lawyer. - I'll handle him. - Genna? - I need to talk to you. - Did you tell them that I didn't do it? - The tapes I had you make copies of, you sold them, didn't you? The ones that you gave back to me? - I'm sorry, Genna. I know it looks bad. - You sign this, you get to leave. But only if you tell me who bought them. No lawyers, no games. I want a name. (suspenseful music) - We're already tracking down the Ebay user. Good job. - You can let him go. - We'll get it started. In the meantime, let's get you safe. This is security specialist Jones. He will be no more than a room away from you for the evening. - My daughter and Zack? - I've got two teams with them. This guy's not killing anyone tonight. - Just make sure my daughter is taken care of. - It's gonna take a few hours to track down this email. The guy that bought them used an email chain. - Like Kaos would use. Hey, when Ethan's released, keep a tail on him. Don't let him breathe without me knowing about it. - Right. (crickets chirping) - Hold up. Let me check it out first. - All right. (phone ringing) - [Kiera] Hey, it's Kiera. I can't come to the phone right now but if you leave a message, I'll get back to you as soon as I can. - Hey sweety, it's mom. I'm just calling to say hi. I miss you. Like a lot. Call me as soon as you can, okay? Love you. - It's clear. - You sure I can't get you anything else? - No, the sandwich is fine. - So where are you from? - Chicago. - Oh yeah? What part? - South side. - So there's drinks in the fridge if you get thirsty. - Thank you. (phone ringing) I'ma go check the perimeter before we lock down. - Sure. Hello? - [Justin] Hey, Jenna. - Hey, Justin. Where have you been? - [Justin] A triple car accident on the freeway filled the ER. I've been in surgery for nearly 16 hours, sorry. - It's okay. (tense music) (siren blaring in distance) (music intensifying) (clinking) (thudding) (guns firing) (glass shattering) - Get back inside! (gun cocking) - Agh! (intense ominous music) Justin? Justin, call the police. Justin? (tense music) Oh. Send units to this address. There's a man down. Contact Detective Briggs, tell her that Genna's in trouble. - Genna. Are you okay? I heard gunfire. - [Genna] Justin, get back. - What are you doing? - I know that it was you. I saw the tapes. - What tapes? - Don't act stupid, I saw them in the kitchen. Move, go back! - Okay, you're acting crazy. - Why did you kill them? - Who? - Tell me why! - Okay, can we just put this- - Not until you tell me why, get back! - Okay, okay, okay! Just relax! - [Genna] Open the door. - Dammit, Genna! I loved you! All right, the time that we spent together was incredible. Claire never made me feel the way that you did. And then she got sick and you and Zack fixed things. - I don't understand, what are you saying? - Claire was already dying of cancer. I loved her, okay? She asked me to. - You killed Claire? - You don't know what it was she was going through. You didn't have to hear her at night crying from the pain! - Why Lydia and Amber?! - I don't even know- - Put your hands on top of your head! - Not yet! I did this for you. This is a mistake, I just wanted to talk to her. (somber music) (light music) - We found hard evidence. Cameras, computers, new devices. - Devices? - The guy had a chair with a large metal spike for a seat. - There's evidence he sent texts and emails to you by rerouting them through anonymous IP addresses. We also have a copy of all the videos he sent you. There's a video of you and Justin. - Yeah. I'm sorry Genna, but I think you'll have to sit this case out. Have one of the staff do it. Conflict of interest. And one other thing, you know Jeff says that your poll numbers are through the roof, so you really need to start focusing on this election. - Mom. - [Genna] Baby, I'm so glad you're okay. - Is your ankle okay? - Yeah, they said it's just twisted. (gentle music) - Hello. - Hi. Can we meet up and talk about it? - [Zack] Yeah, I'd like that. - Maybe over dinner? - [Zack] Yeah. Our place? - That sounds great. - [Zack] Say I pick you up at seven? - All right, I'll see you then. Bye, Zack. (sighing) - [Justin] Bail isn't going to be a problem so I'll see you on the streets. (laughing) - Yep, for now. (eerie music) Something doesn't feel right. - You're getting that too? (siren blaring in distance) - Zack, where are you? It's almost eight. Our reservations were like 15 minutes ago, call me. (phone chiming) (eerie music) (cars whooshing) (tense music) Hello? (phone ringing) Zack, this isn't funny, where are you? - [Killer] Hello, Genna. So good to see you again. - Who is this? - [Killer] An old friend. (doors buzzing and slamming) (intense music) - [Kiera] Mom! - Kiera? - Mom, is that you? Help me. - Don't you hurt her. I will kill you, you son of a bitch! Open the doors! - [Killer] Now that I have your attention, there's a van outside, do you see it? - [Genna] Yes. - [Killer] Go to it. Knock on the passenger door twice. - Is my daughter okay? Is she okay?! - [Killer] Not if you don't hurry. (buzzing) (tense music) (banging) - What now? - [Killer] A shock! - [Alison] Is this the face of our killer? - I've been on the job for 35 years. One thing I can tell you is trust your gut. - We get the DNA results back from Jack Myer's burnt body yet? - Never saw it. - Call the morgue. Find out where it is. (eerie music) ♪ Does your daddy know you're gone ♪ ♪ Will he worry where you've been ♪ ♪ Is it really oh so wrong ♪ To want you as my friend ♪ And I've often wondered why (ominous music) - She's awake. Alert our financier to her status. - Where's Kiera? - You shouldn't move about so much, my dear. You're bound by an ancient Chinese method of torture. The knot around your neck tightens with each new struggle. - Where is she?! (buzzing) (tense music) (buzzing) (Zack screaming) Let them go! (Kaos chuckling) You were dead. - And was resurrected! After three days in the ground. (coughing) Life after death is so much more fun. And the cost was my teeth! (Kaos coughing) (Melissa screaming) - Son of a... - You'll never guess what I found. - That it's not Jack Myers' body. - No, we still don't know. The test was canceled by Chief Williams two weeks ago. - I'm gonna show you something. - Sanderson had this office downtown where she sees other people. Real scum hole. Most of the building is vacant. - I thought you sent some of our guys to check it out. - I did. - Genna Knowles, leave a message. - Genna, it's Briggs, call me as soon as you get this. We gotta go. (Kaos coughing) (eerie music) - Just had to see for yourself, eh? - Quit messing around and finish it. There's the rest of the cash. - I think not. We requested double. - And I said no. Now finish the job. - Not without proper compensation. - For Christ's sake. (gun firing) (Kaos groaning) - Jack! (gun firing) Jack! - [Kiera] Help me! Somebody help me! - You're a worthless scumbag! And now you're dead. - Oh. Frank. Please, untie me. - Well hello, Genna. Funny seeing you here. - This rope, it's choking me. - Well let me see if I can fix that. You know I usually prefer the bone saw but I think for this particular procedure, I'm gonna need something a little more delicate. Now I just have to be careful not to slip. (Genna coughing) - How did you find me? - Oh. Oh, no. Genna, I'm not here to save you. See, you need to die. - What? (phone ringing) - Briggs. Well, should I answer it? Nah. (cracking) Can you hear me now, Briggs? - Murderer. You were supposed to serve and protect. - And I have. 25 long years of protecting and serving up political bullcrap. I was primed to be mayor and you took that from me. This city is mine. I have plans and people are counting on me for change. There's a lot of money at stake and I can't let them down. - So you broke Kaos out of prison? - Well, it was a pretty good plan. Until somebody got greedy! And now I have to finish what he started. But, that's okay, do you know why? Because after you die, I will swoop in, save your daughter, and be the hero again. (intense music) (siren blaring) - It's going straight to voice mail. - That's not good. - [Dispatch] Detective Briggs? - Go for Briggs. - [Dispatch] We are unable to locate Police Chief Williams at this time. - 10-4. (intense music) Step on it. (car revving) - Help me! Help me! Somebody help me! - Now. Which button do I press? - Don't do this, please! - Eeny meeny miney moe. (computer buzzing) (gas hissing) (Zack screaming) - [Kiera] Help me! (computer beeping) - Hahah, people want to see you die. You know I think maybe I will just use the bone saw. (music intensifying) (bashing) (Frank grunting) (bashing) (gas hissing) - [Kiera] Somebody help me! (Zack screaming) - You can't take it from me! (computer beeping) (Zack screaming) (Frank grunting) (haunting music) - He's so sloppy. - [Kiera] Help! (siren blaring) Somebody, please. - Don't move! Drop the knife! - Somebody please help me! (Zack screaming) Help, somebody, help! (computer beeping) Mom, please help me. - No, please. (gun firing) (thudding) (computer beeping) (birds chirping) - Jack Myers was pronounced dead at the scene. There is an ongoing investigation into the involvement of Police Chief Williams who was murdered - How was basketball? - by Jack Myers. - Good, I won my first game. - Oh you did? - In the meantime the mayor has appointed Detective - I'm so proud of you. - [Reporter] Angela Briggs as acting police chief. (doorbell dinging) - I'm gonna get it. - And in other news, Genna Knowles has retracted her bid for the mayor's office citing the need to rebuild the DA's office after such a tragedy. - Who is it? - I'm gonna go do my homework. - She definitely takes after you. - Maybe a little. - Sorry I missed our dinner date. - You had a pretty good excuse. This time. - Mmm. I miss my wife. - Mom. Can I interview you for my class project? - Sure honey, sure you can. (electronic dance music) Okay.
