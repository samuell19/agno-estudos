- Long ago, before the time of man there lived a fairy king whose name was Ar. Now Ar lived in a land called the Angel Isle and he had ruled for 1,000 years before the first man set foot in his realm. Now to the fairy king and his people men seemed large and loud, quick tempered and destructive, beings who had no time for the gentle ways of fairy folk, and before they realized what they did the men drove Ar and his people from the fields and woods right up to the edge of the deep green sea. Now Ar was trapped and his people could go no further so in desperation the fairy king sent a message to the Emerald Isle asking for help from Timish the leprechaun king, but Timish was powerless to help as Ar and the fairy folk were barred from the Emerald Isle, but still he could not turn his back on his cousin Ar and therefor he asked the giant Fin McCool for help. - A giant? - Yes Evie a giant. - Evie shh. - Shh yourself. - Well Fin McCool was usually a bad giant, but in this case he was pleased to help the people of Ar in return for the hand in marriage of Ar's daughter Tumbeleen. Tumbeleen was very sad at the thought of marriage to a giant but after her father persuaded her she finally agreed, so Timish struck the deal with Fin McCool and as the fairy folk rejoiced the lumbering giant ripped up a huge piece of the Emerald Isle and throwing back his mighty arm he set the piece of land sailing through the air across the sea. - Cool. - Well when the noise had settled and the water grew calm the giant's voice boomed across the sea telling Ar and his people that the new land he had created was to be called the Isle of Man in honor of the king of the sea, but that Ar and his people could live there for as long as Tumbeleen was his wife. - Poor Tumbeleen. - Ah wait and see. So Ar took his people to the new land and he made ready for a huge celebration to which he invited the giant. Tumbeleen was dressed in fairest silks with dainty flowers for a crown ready to be the giant's bride and waited at the cliff's with Ar and all his people as Fin McCool waded from the Emerald Isle to the new land he had made. Well the giant's voice booms out, "Oh fairy king I have done what you asked, "now I come for my bride," and to the amazement of all those around Ar laughed and laughed. "Oh foolish giant how can that be? "You are too large to live on this little land "and Tumbeleen is forever barred from the Emerald Isle, "where would you live?" - Hooray Tumbeleen is safe, she's safe Grandma. - Well, only partly, but one day, one can only hope. - Grandma? - What? Oh sorry. Right, where was I? Yes here we are. Now as you can imagine the giant was not too pleased, in fact he was downright furious at being tricked and in his rage he scooped up all of Ar's people in his giant hand and with the other he tore a large hole and there he placed Ar and all his people covering them with dirt, he buried them deep underground and his voice boomed out across the sea, "King Ar, oh treacherous fool, "the land that I gave you so that you might live in peace "shall now be a prison forever more." - Look the Fairy Bridge. - It's so beautiful. - Remember in the story when you cross the bridge you have to say hi to the fairies or they give you bad luck. - Hi fairies. - Evie see if you can see one. - Daddy I saw one. - Great. - Wow look at this place. - Yeah, where is Hansel and Gretel huh? - This is Grandma's? - Wow this is ares? - Yeah I guess, I guess it is. - Cool. - Hey, what do you say we check it out? - Yeah. - Kyle, Kyle back up here. Well nobody's lived here for 40 years, but everything, the grounds are very neat, electricity works. - Well I guess there's a caretaker. - I wonder why your mother never, never came back here? Hello? - Come on Evie. - 'Kay, wait for me. - Hey hey hey careful, don't break anything. - Where is everybody? - It's weird. - Hey, look at all this old stuff. Oh, and pots and pans.

Ah, Nancy-- - Mom, Dad, look what we found. It's the fairy. - Ew, what a horrible picture, what are those things? - It's goblins Mom, you know, wicked fairies, they live underground. - It's in Grandma's book. - It's interesting. - Yeah well I don't like it, can we take it down? - Yeah, let me see. I'm afraid not, looks like it's bolted to the wall. - Look what I found. - Careful. - Ooh now that's better. Hey let's take it outside. There, let's hope they bring us luck. Oh god it's beautiful. I wonder how much property there is. - You know the letter didn't really say did it? - Well I love it. I'm glad we came, Mom would be so pleased that we're all here together. - Well so am I. - We need this. Rob we've got to do something about that. - I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm sorry I haven't been there. - Well you are now. Hey, who would've thought someone as ugly as you would have married someone as wonderful as me? - That is an understatement. - Kyle look. Don't worry, we'll save you, we promised Grandma. Mom, Dad look. - Fireflies. - Look it right there. - Incredible. - Smells good. So what is this? - An English breakfast. - Oh, I'm gonna get fat. Where are the kids? - They were up and out hours ago. Oh I made an appointment for you at the doctors. - Okay, okay. - Hi. You're the fairy, I'm Evie. Wait for me. - Evie where you going? Evie? - Hey. Hey what do you want? - Nothing. - Well who are you running from, eh? - We weren't running from nothing, we were playing. - With the fairies. - Hmm?

Nobody owns this house, and all the monsters that live in it and you shouldn't be playing in these woods. If you do they'll be watching you. They like to eat small children. - Ah you're just acting crazy. - Oh am I? Hey don't say I didn't warn you. Ow. - Rob, I'm going to take Evie and Kyle into the village and do some shopping, I'll drop you off at the doctor. - Oh right, yeah I was thinking, maybe I'll take Kyle with me and stop off at the church afterwards and see if they keep any records on this place. - Hey take it easy, you alright? - We saw that-- - Evie met a fairy. - Really? - Yeah she lives under the bridge. - Hey, friends already, you guys ready to go? - Yeah I'll meet you guys in the car, I gotta, I think my wallet's upstairs. - Okay, come on, let's wait in the car. - Why didn't you tell them about that man? - 'Cause he's crazy, I didn't want to worry Dad so he'd want to leave. - But he said the monsters will get us. - Evie he's just trying to scare us. - No you heard what Grandma said. - Evie it's just a dumb story in a book Grandma wrote. Look hasn't Dad changed? Is it more fun, isn't it better here? - Yeah. - We have to keep him here Evie or else he's gonna go away and we'll never see him again just like before. - We still have to save the fairies. - Hey come on guys, let's go, let's go. - We promised Grandma. - Was that you? What in the devil? What the devil? Now we know, we know don't we Tippit? Alright we know. You don't frighten me with your little tricks. Whoa, hey. Hey. - Take that when you need it, and in the meantime I'll call you when I hear from the lab. - Alright thank you. - And take it easy, no strenuous exercise. - Alright. - You alright? - Yeah. - Hmm, they don't look very nice. - Mom? - I know honey. You know it's rude to stare. - Dad. Firefly. - Good job, good job. Here roll that out slowly, don't want to rip it. There we are, Firefly Mine, claim 18, gold. According to this there's a goldmine on the property. - Grandma owned a goldmine? - That's what it says here. - Can I help you? - Yes, we were just looking for the records for the Ballaugh property. - Ballaugh, may I ask who wants to know? - I'm sorry I'm Rob Preston, this is my, this is my son, he's the new owner. - We don't have any information on the Ballaugh property. - Well surely there must be something? - There isn't any, not as far as I know. Now if you'll excuse me? - Sure, yeah of course. Thank you. I don't get it, it's gotta be here somewhere, look there's the water right there right? Well it's gotta be right here somewhere, we must be standing on it. - Dad. - What is that? Come here. That's gold, Kyle that's gold, where? Here come here, take the map, look right around here. Nancy, Nancy! Nancy, Nancy, Nancy look at this. - Why what is it? - Gold, Kyle found it down in the creek. - Gold? - Yes. - You've dug this out of the creek? - Supposedly there's a goldmine here somewhere, we haven't found any trace of it yet, but we found a map at the church that said Firefly Mine. - Firefly? - Do you remember what your mother said? Fireflies, remember? - No I-- - Nancy, she's left us a goldmine. - No. - Yeah. - Dad, I found it, I found the mine. - You found what mine? - Where, where? - Come on follow me. - Show me where? - Wait for me. - What are you talking about? - Look, look there's the mine. - Where? - Right there. - You're right, right there it is, Nancy Nancy look come here. It's under here. See there it is, it's right under there, Nancy look it's right there, we own a goldmine. - We're rich. - Yay. - Can we open it Dad, can we? - Oh you betcha but we're gonna need a pump, there must be some pump around here, it's probably old or rusted or something. Nancy you guys check over here Kyle let's look over here. - Yeah I've got to see this mine, where is it? Is that it? It's hard to imagine there's a mine under all this water. - Nancy, Nancy, can I have a word with you? - Oh no, what now? - Nancy, you don't mind if I call you that? I'd just like to apologize about yesterday. - Yeah well you scared Evie. - I know I'm sorry, sorry Evie I didn't mean to. It's just that I didn't know you were coming. - Well didn't the solicitors tell you? - No, nobody mentioned it to me. - Well I'm sorry. You knew my mother? - Yes well actually we were cousins. I supposed that makes us all family. - Really well I didn't realize. Oh well it's very beautiful around here, peaceful. - Yes well don't be fooled, it may look beautiful on the surface, but the pond, the house, it's all tainted, tainted with evil. - What's that supposed to mean? - It means that anyone with any sense will stay well away from this place. - Really? - A lot of people have died here. Please I wouldn't want you to be next. - Hey, hey hey hey. What're you doing here? - No you can't, you must be mad, you can't drain that pond. - Yeah here we go again, look I'm mad, this is our pond, this is our house, if we want to drain it, then that's exactly what we'll do and you better get used to the idea. - You're making a mistake, a big mistake, look Elizabeth knew, she knew, that's why we took here away from here. - Knew what, that there was a goldmine in here? Yeah maybe that's why you're so keen to keep people away huh? So you can keep it all to yourself? - You know about the mine? - I sure do. It's deep huh? - Please you've got to listen to me, don't open that mine. You open that mine, you'll free the demons. - Demons? Please just go away. Come on Kyle, go away. - Alright, I'll go, but before this is over, you'll be needing me. - Okay well thank you very much, we'll remember that, leave your phone number at the front door, bye, thank you. - You okay Mom? - Yeah, yeah honey, so where did you find this? - Oh it's in a box right over there. In fact Evie I want you to run over there, see that brown box, when I tell you to you'll see a red switch, I want you to hit it alright? Hope this is gonna work. Kyle get ready. - Ready? - Go ahead. - Yay it works. - Alright look this is gonna take a while to drain, I'm starving, let's go inside and get something to eat, we'll come back in a little while, and don't you worry there's a lunatic in every family. - Yeah well there is in yours. - Who would that be? - The fools. God. Bloody fools. I'll show him. Then they'll have to believe me. I'll show 'em, what do you think about that? What do you think about that?

Okay. - Time for bed Kyle, come on Evie. - Off to bed, up you go like a rocket, one, two, three. - Here you are darling. - I want a pony. - We're not rich yet. - I want one daddy. - Hey you know there might not be anything down there. But we'll find out tomorrow won't we? Goodnight Kyle. - Goodnight my little scrumptious bumtious. - Alright in we go, in we go, in we go. Big kiss huh? Alright, night guys. - Night. - Goodnight Dad. - Night. - They're so beautiful, they want us to save them Kyle. - Save who from what? Who are you waving to? - The fairies, who do you think? - What? You're so weird. - What's a matter? - Oh nothing I guess. It's just, what if Ian's right? - What, what that we have monsters in our garden? - No, but it could be dangerous opening an old mine, and what did he mean when he said Mom knew and being then being taken away? - Oh Nancy I have no idea, but don't let it get to you, look at this. - Why are these people so against us, what have we done to make them hate us? - They're not against us, we're just newcomers, you know that in 20 years, we're still gonna be newcomers. - Yeah but I don't think I want to hang around for 20 years. - Well do you want to go home? - No no of course not. - Want to get under the covers with me? - Maybe. - Want some gold? - Definitely. Come on give it to me, I want it. - Here it is, come and get it, come and get it. - Demons, demons! - Let go of me, let go, stop it, let go. Dad! Dad. - Kyle, Kyle you okay, what? - What's wrong Kyle? - I had a bad dream about the mine and the goblins. - Just a dream Kyle, just a dream. - It's all this talk of fairies and demons. Come on darling lie down, just close your eyes and go to sleep, think good thoughts, it's all right. - Mom? - Evie back to bed, come on. There you go. Okay back to sleep. Good girl. Ian has a lot to answer for. - You'll be alright okay? I'll leave the light on. - Can I sleep with you? - Who's that? - I don't know, what time is it? It's six o'clock. - It's alright, it's just someone at the door that's all. - Got you out of bed a bit early have I? - Yeah, yeah something like that. - Sorry about that, early risers around here. Jim Blythe, local constabulary. - Hi, hi, Rob Preston. - Bit early for a cup of tea is it? Or will that be coffee, why you being an American? - Whatever. - Morning Mom. - Good morning. - It's only a visit. - Ah yeah sure, here she is, here she is. 587 - Thank you Mom. - So to what do we owe the pleasure? - Oh just a social call. We like to know who's moving in and who's moving out. - Do you want us to move out? - What ever gave you that idea? - Well if you don't, you're the only one in town who doesn't. - Oh you shouldn't take too much to store in what people say around here Mom. They mean no harm, they're just suspicious that's all and this property of yours has got its fair share of history. - Well like what exactly? - A couple of miners were killed when the mine was closed down. Way back in 1800's I think it was. - Why'd they close it down? - Well one day they opened up a knew gap and a pile of creatures swarmed out. - Creatures? - Some of the locals think they're still down there. - Well you don't believe that do you? - I didn't say I did, but some of the folk around here do. - Well you're aware that there may be gold down in that mine? - Aye, so I've heard. - Are you not from around here? - No, Lanchester lad, been here for 15 years, but I'm still an outsider. - Do you think maybe that, maybe these people are trying to frighten us so they can get their greedy hands on the gold? - No Mr. Preston I don't. Things go a lot deeper than that around here. I'm afraid you're into something far bigger than greed. Well you'll call me if you need me? - Will I, need you? - Not if you leave your mine alone. Nice to have met you Mom, thanks for the coffee. I'll make me own way out. - What ever happened to, "hi nice to meet you, welcome to the community," I think it rains too much on these people. - Are we gonna leave? - No, no, 'cause I don't believe in demons, I don't believe in goblins and I don't believe in fairies. No we're not going anywhere until we decide to. Now, why don't we get dressed. I think I want to check out that gold mine. - It's the fairies from Grandma's story. - What? - You know Tumbeleen and the fairy folk of Ar, they're trapped underground. - Evie you're so stupid. - Right, I've got you now, let's see you get out of that. What, where, where'd it go? - Firefly Mine. - Cool. - Hey Kyle careful. Oh Rob I don't like this, I mean nevermind the legend, but I think you should leave this mine alone it's old and dangerous. - Relax we're gonna be fine. - Can I go with you? - No, I think I better go first huh? - Okay. - Hold still. - Mom, Dad! - Kyle! - Kyle! - Dad! - Kyle! - Dad! - Kyle! - Dad! - Kyle! - Come on Dad. - Kyle! - Dad help. Dad! - Kyle, Kyle! - Dad. - Come here, come here, it's okay, it's okay, I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha. - Something got my foot. - No you just caught it on something don't worry, come on. You alright, you okay? Look at me you alright? Okay, let's get out of here, over here, over here. Oh hold on, easy easy, easy, that's it, careful. Look at me, are you alright, you sure? Alright. Oh man. Check this out. - Whoa. - Wow. - Is that? - Gold? - Dad. The gateway to hell, September 22nd 1887. - Whoa. - Now come on come on let's get warm, we can come back down. - Mom's not gonna believe this. - No she's not. Here take my hand, take my hand. Be very careful now, wait wait wait wait. Alright, watch where you're walking. Now hold on, hold on, we'll get this hose back down there and we'll drain the rest of this. Here take this, take. - Rob? Kyle, are you okay? - Be careful. - Rob? - Nancy! - Mom! - Nancy! - Kyle! - Mom. - Hey, hey, are you alright? - Are you alright, what'd you find down there, what'd you see? - There's gold everywhere down there Mom. - Nancy it's the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen in my entire life. - Can I see, can I please? - Evie not now. - A bit later Evie, come on let's get you into a nice warm bath. - Careful. - Look at you, come on darling, you'll catch a cold Kyle, come on inside. - Come on. - Dad. - Daddy. - Dad. - Call 999, get an ambulance. - Daddy? - Hurry. - Daddy? - Mrs. Preston we've got the results of the test we did. I'm afraid there's no easy way to say this, your husband's very sick Mrs. Preston, but we'll know more in a couple of days, but there's not much we can do except help him stay as comfortable as possible. - Well what are you saying? - With rest and medication, he may have two or three months. - He's going to die? - I suggest you take him home. He'll be better off in the States there. They're better equipped for, this sort of thing. I'm sorry. - When is Daddy coming home? - They said he could come home in a couple of days. - What does Dad have? - Come here. Your father, he's very sick. - Is he going to die like Grandma? - I want you to do something for me right now, I want you to pray, I want you to pray to god, and ask him for a miracle. - Let go, let me go. Let go. No! - Help us Kyle. Evie? Evie? Where are you? - Kyle! - Evie, my god Evie, are you alright? - I hurt my arm. Ow, ow. Ow, ow. Ow my arm hurts, it hurts. - Look we gotta get you out of here. You stay here and I'll go get Mom okay? - No don't go. - I have to. Evie. Stay back don't come any closer. Stay away, stay away. Don't come any closer, don't hurt Evie, please don't hurt Evie. - It's alright Kyle, she'll help us. - No don't hurt Evie please. - Evie, Evie. - I want to go home, I feel so tired. - Don't worry, I'll take you home, you'll be okay, don't worry, come on. Evie. Evie, Evie? - What? - Your fairy friend can help Dad Evie. Make him well. - No Kyle she can't. - But your arm, she cured your arm. - This is different, only the fairy king has enough power to save Dad. - Then we have to set him free. - What's wrong? - What if Ian's right, I mean what if they're evil and they start killing again because we opened up the mine, then what? - They won't. - What if they do, what if they're demons? - We gotta take a chance. - Yeah, come on. - Kyle? What do you think you're doing? I've been looking for you everywhere, I thought something might have happened to you. Now I don't want you to ever come down here again this mine is dangerous and I don't want you anywhere near it. - But Mom they could save Dad if I open it. - Who can? - You know, Evie's friend the fairy. - Kyle? - Really, really Mom. - Kyle, I know you're frightened, so am I, but I need you to be strong for me Kyle. - Remember E.T., his finger? - Oh Kyle. That was just a film, a film. Now look I don't want you to come down here again, it's dangerous down here okay? Promise me Kyle, promise. - I promise. - Okay, come on now. - I'm sorry, we tried, we promised Grandma we'd help you and we're doing all we can. Now Mom won't let us in the mine, no one will believe us. And Grandma's not here to talk to, what are we going to do? - Shh. - I don't know what I'm going to do. Daddy's very sick, can you help him? - Well, what, damn, missed the little blighter. - Don't hurt me, please don't hurt me. - It's alright. - Keep away! - It's alright I'm not going to hurt you, calm down. - It's those little devils that I'm after. Hey, you shouldn't be down here with them. I mean you shouldn't be here at all, they're not good. - Keep away. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey I didn't mean to frighten you. Oh. Alright don't be like that, didn't mean to scare her. Come on. - He almost got me. - Ian? - What are we gonna do? - I'm gonna go into town and get some help. - Can I come too? - No, you stay here. - Thanks Gladys, see ya. - Excuse me. - Yes? - I was wondering, do you have a bulletin board where people put there wanted ads? - Yes, what is it you need? - Yeah, I live above the Ballaugh house and I was wondering if somebody could help me work up at the mine. - Ballaugh, oh my god. Are you mad? Go, get out of my shop, go. - Let's go. - Let's go, come on. - Excuse me, excuse me. I was wondering if you could help me open up the mine? I live up at the Ballaugh house. - No, no way, I've got no time to waste on ya, get out of here, go on, clear out kid. - I live up at the Ballaugh house and I was wondering if anybody could help me? I could pay. - I told you and your sister to leave, before the monsters get ya. - Stay away from Evie Mister, leave her alone. - Or what? I told you to leave and you wouldn't and now you father's sick, see he's paying the price for meddling in things he doesn't understand. - You're a liar. - Give me another one of those. - There was no call to frighten the kid. - Ah well, everyday they're up at that place, we're in more danger here. I'd just like to see them go for their own good as well as ours. - Has it ever occurred to you that we're far too old to believe all this nonsense? - What are you talking? I've seen them. But what would you know? You don't belong here anymore than they do. - That's it isn't it Ian, that's what really scares you. Anyone who's different, anyone who doesn't fit in with your limited knowledge world. And the rest of you, you're all just as bad. All of ya, prejudiced, it doesn't matter if they're demons or people, if they're different they scare ya, and what scares ya, you destroy, even a little kid. You're pathetic. - Get him! - Come on let's go. - Get out of the way. - Get him. - Come on let's get him. Now we got him. - My bike. - Kyle? Kyle? - No one will help us Evie, no one. - Then we'll have to do it ourselves. - We can't. - We got to Kyle. - We can't. - We promised Grandma. - Hey, hey what's all the shouting about? - Dad, dad, it's true there are goblins in the mine, they're trapped, they're really fairies. Can't you see, they can help you Dad, all we've got to do is open it up and let them go. - This is ridiculous. We should've stomped on this nonsense right at the beginning. - Please Dad believe me, help me open it, help me save them. - Please Daddy. - No we need to get your father home where he can get the treatment he needs. - Nancy. - Rob I'm not gonna let you do this. - I've got to, it's important to them. Just for a couple of days. A couple of days. Alright there it is. Now Kyle take these and hang them on the tree next to you, there you go. Thanks. Alright.

Watch out. That's good. Alright Evie get ready. - Okay Dad. - Alright, hit it. That's good, Kyle grab that shovel would you? Good days work guys. Bright and early tomorrow morning. - Yeah. - Hey what's wrong? - Nothing. I mean what if we open the mine and the goblins are evil, then what? - Well, you know sometimes Kyle you just gotta go with your feelings, you gotta take a chance in what you believe in. Do you think they're evil? - No, no. - Well then we have to help them. Alright Evie come on, why don't we get cleaned up? Kyle I want you to turn off these lights and secure the ore cart alright? - Sure. - Hey.

Do you thing we're kidding about things in that mine? Look see for yourself, there. Look at the face of a demon. - You're crazy, just a crazy old man. They're not demons, they're the ones dead aren't they? If they're so evil how come they're the ones dead, how come they're the ones lying there? - Hey. - You're the ones that are evil not them. You are, you killed them, they were trapped, all they wanted to do was to escape and you killed them, you, you and your stupid town.

No. - No Mom, they'll help us. - Nancy. - Bye Tumbeleen. - You did it, you did it, they're free. - Oh honey. - We stayed on the Isle of Man. Dad takes me and Evie fishing a lot with him. Tests found no sign of the sickness in his body. Ian turned out to be just one of Mom's cousins, seems she has a lot of cousins here. I'm glad we freed the goblins so they can go home. So Evie says she still plays with the fairies at the bottom of the garden, I guess it's nice to know that there's still a little magic left in the world.
