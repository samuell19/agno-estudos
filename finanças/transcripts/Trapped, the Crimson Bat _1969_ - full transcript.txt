A strange quirk of fate maybe. Who are you? Me? I'm a drifter known as Blind Oichi. I'm after reward money. Trapped, The Crimson Bat A Kyoto Eiga Co., Ltd.

Seems heavy. You're stronger than you look. Don't try to flatter me. I'm not. I disapprove of you. Killing people for reward money. I must seem very bad. You think I'm a terrible woman too? No, I don't. I like pretty women. Don't make a mistake. It's not a raid. This is Tanbei Magari, a fugitive with a price on his head. Pay me the 25 ryo reward money. Sister! Okyo. I said to be good and wait at the inn. Okyo. Let's go. Next! Next! No luck today! You're no good. What's that? Isn't it so? Big men and losing to one blind woman. It hurts! Stop it! Loaded dice! Cheating! That does it! You know you can't get away with it, don't you? What'll you do about it then? Strip! So? You want to see my flesh so much? Then...! What's the matter? Not going to love me? You're not? I'll love you then but good. This is made from women's hair. Once it curls around you, you can't get away. The hate of jilted women's woven in it. If you want to live, you'll obey me! What do we do? You'll see. Echigoya finally came. You're Oen? Yes. Where's my daughter? Leave it to me. You have the girl? Before that...you've the money? 200 pieces of gold. Echigoya has it. But only in exchange for the girl. All right. Very well. Let's go. But... You're bad enough to blackmail Echigoya for his girl. Don't try any tricks. You'll lose all. You know that? I wonder. We'll wait to hear from you. A dog. Acting big! Once, there lived a poor old couple... He went out for firewood, She went to wash some clothes. Sister! A nice song. It brings back memories. It does? I will. Here! Thank you. Sister! Let me do it! Okyo. Are you really an orphan? You don't seem like one. Sister! You called me out? Say, you! Let me go! No! You got fooled, Blind Oichi. What do mean by kidnapping Okyo? It's plain. For money. She's worth 200 ryo. What? Two hundred pieces of gold? That orphan? Don't try that. You were after the money too. Wait! Wait! Okyo...200 ryo. Woman. Woman. Who is it? Don't get me wrong. We want you to buy something. A cute little girl. Okyo! You don't have to. Selling her to Oen, an awful hussy, then. How about it, Oichi? Yes or no? How much? Twenty five ryo. You've got it. You snatched Tanbei from us. Since you know so much... Not quite. So soon! Is Okyo there? Right before you! Can't you see? Poor man. Are you blind too? You're dumb. I'm blind. I have to hear her voice. That's so. Sister! Okyo! Sister! Listen carefully. Shut your eyes and don't move from there. Here's the 25 ryo. Take it. Sister! You can't have both! Remember it! Sister! You lied to me? You're not an orphan. You're not? Okyo! It's not a lie! It's not a lie! Sister... Don't ever let me go, will you? Let's always be together! You'll promise me? The girl? Musashiya. Be still! No use talking to you. Echigoya. Betrayed me, didn't you? Of course not. I see. They fussed at Musashiya, so you failed? Yes, that's right! Learn to lie better. Excuse me. Who is it? Echigoya told me to come. Echigoya? I don't know him. Your business? This settles everything? Money? What do you mean by this? Not enough? I asked why! I've no idea what you're trying to get at! No monkey business! Blackmailing a girl's parent is going too far for a woman. Don't you agree, Blind Oichi? Echigoya wants things done quietly, so I brought the money. Ordinarily, I'd arrest you! Okyo, you... I didn't lie! I want to be with you! I hate Father and Mother! Miss! Leave me alone! Sister! Sister! Listen to me! No, I won't listen to you! Go home! Go home! Blind Oichi kills people for money in cold blood. She's an awful woman. If you're with her, it'll be a bloody life without a moment's peace. Return to Echigoya. There's no need to choose a life of misery. Listen to me. She's a wicked woman who'd make you unhappy too. She saved you when you left home, knowing you're Echigoya's daughter. She had a scheme in her mind. A lie! Stupid talk! That's enough! Take the girl and get out! You promised me! That you'd never let me go! Be still and get out! Sister! Leave the money and get out, both of you! Miss! An insult! Misery! Unhappy! I've always been plenty happy! No boring people for me! I couldn't care less! You're unhappy, aren't you? I saw you kill a man. Blood spurted out. It was a gory sight. I know you don't do it just for pleasure. Why not throw away your sword-cane? I can't bear watching a woman like you. I've been unhappy too. You say even a woman like me if I throw away my sword-cane...? If I try? Yes, of course, you can become happy. Why don't you kill me? I wonder why. Bored, I guess. How about joining hands with me? No, I like being alone. Bitten by my poisonous snake, it's really the end for you. How beautiful! - Where'd she come from? - Not a Goddess in disguise? Say, they've come! To rob us! Trouble! They've come! Wait! We can't eat if you take our rice. Be still! Hurry up! Please don't take them! Go to the Governor's office if you've any complaints! Grandfather! When will they ever stop? We'll all starve to death! The Instructor? I went for him but he's out. It's the last straw! Let's go complain! Mosaku? Oichi. Should you be up? I feel fine, thanks to you. I see. That's... You went to the lake? The farmers were shouting a while ago. Bunzo's men came to rob us again. Boss Bunzo Kazama. Took the rice the farmers hid and didn't offer as taxes. If we pay all the government says, we can't get along, so we hide some. Hidden rice, so we can't complain. He takes advantage of it. How cruel! They're human trash! Just because we don't report it! We've paid your boss! There's just so much we can stand! Strong words for farmers. What'll you do about it? Using force, are you? Come out, everybody! They came to complain! Love them! Instructor! Fools! I told you not to do anything reckless! Forget it? That does it! Fighting? Want to get hurt? Be still! Kill him! Wait! Boss! Fool! Who said to do it? Looks awful! Take them away! I'm sorry. I've told them to leave farmers alone. No sense. Pardon them for my sake. Boss. Stop coming to the village to steal hidden rice after this. Hidden rice? A mistake? It's taboo for farmers to hide rice. So you take advantage of it. But don't forget even farmers may rebelif they can't eat. I'll remember it. Oen? Why'd you come back? Have a drink. I heard. Lectured to by a masterless samurai. Not sharp any more? It's wiser to get the rice without causing trouble. By the way, I've companions. Listen, greet the boss. We want to stay a while. Criminals? Well, yes. One's Chinese? Sun, show him what you can do. He'll be of use? What're you up to? Hear about the blind woman at the village edge? Blind woman? I don't follow you. They call her Blind Oichi. Always after reward money. Oichi. You're really not a goddess in disguise? Don't joke. But I've never seen anyone so beautiful before in my life. What a thing to say. Don't tease me. Tease you? I wouldn't! I really... It's... Sound of water... You can hear the lake here. Quiet, isn't it? Compared to my world until now, it's like a dream. Listen, Oichi, you... You wouldn't think of staying in our village? This village? The soil's bad, the villagers are poor and Boss robs us. But we can eat if we work hard! The villagers are kind, so if you've a mind to...! I become a farmer? My mistake? I used to farm until I was 17 in Shinshu. - Then Oichi! - Wait! I'm not the woman you think I am. I'm full of sin. I couldn't live happily in this quiet village! Oen? Yes. I don't know how you recovered, but you're a lucky woman. You know? Come with me. Let's settle it today. Draw! Wait! We settled it once, didn't we? I don't want to! What? Blood will be shed if we fight. I hate it now. I never want to again. If you say to apologize, I will. So let me go. I see. You don't want to fight? All right, if that's what you want. Just an ordinary woman if you can't use your sword! Love her all you want to! All right, I'm first! You made me draw. Since I have, expect no mercy! Who wants to die? Remember it! Oichi! You frightened me. You came back? You returned? Mosaku. Never mind. Where were you? Your feet are all cut and bruised. Dangerous out alone. Mosaku. To tell you the truth, I thought you'd gone away. I thought you wouldn't come back, so I... Mosaku. I... I killed people. I killed people! Three of them. Look. The smell of blood clings to it. You know what I am now? People who know me call me Blind Oichi. I walk life's back roads for reward money. Mosaku. You saved my life. I'm deeply indebted to you. It pains me not to repay you but I'm leaving. Don't go! Don't go! Please stay here! Please! If not here, in the village! I can't live without you! Mosaku! Please, I'm asking you, Oichi! Please, Oichi! Mosaku. You really... ...a woman like me? I love you! You mean it? You really love a woman like me? Oichi! Do I look funny? Mother's old Kimono. When you wear it, you seem different. Oichi. Hurry. The fish will swim away. Yes. I'll be going. I'll sell the fish on my way home. Hurry back. Come over tonight! What for? I got me a bride! I'll introduce you! What? Is it true? Found a bride? You? I'll expect you! Come over! Am I surprised though! Someone there? I heard Mosaku found a bride. I'm Otane, Mosaku's cousin. I'm Oichi. How do you do. Is he out? Yes, he went to the lake. Is he gentle? A wedding present. Thank you. You're beautiful and strong on top of it. My grandfather watched you. You killed 3 strong-looking men in a flash! You're back? The Governor's office? Awful! Sarcastic about the 3 criminals! It's your fault! That Oichi! Dead men can't talkâ€” I said I didn't know but... Something more? They've got an idea about the rice. I've got to hurry and get it all. There's some place in the village where they keep it all. To think he'd find such a beauty. How'd you hook her? I don't know. He's shy! Bride, sit here and let me look at you. Please have some. I say! How clever! Pour for me too. Yes, yes. Please drink up. Mosaku. You're a lucky man. Take good care of her. Yes, like a precious treasure. You! Just listen to him! Congratulations, Mosaku. You're late. The Headman called me. Go to the Governor's office tomorrow. I'm to go? The 3 men your wife killed. There was reward money out for them. So you're getting the reward. Wonderful news. We pay there but never get paid. It's 20 ryo. Twenty ryo? She's a great earner. A woman and 20 ryo. A treasure all right. Yes, Mosaku can take it easy. Stop it! Not a topic for a happy day! I don't see Kyusuke. He's not back from town. Drunk and with a woman? Single men... Otane, you marry Kyusuke. Oh, no! A man like him! Spare me! Pardon me! Confess and I will. Where's all the rice hidden? I don't know! Don't know? Spare me... Tell me! In the water mill at the end of the village. Sure? If you go, won't the masterless samurai come out this time? Think I'd forget that? I'll get him and Oichi to fight. Listen... You're Mosaku? I'm Oen. Oichi and I are old friends. You are? I didn't know. How do you do. How do you do. I haven't given you a wedding gift yet. Come with me. With you? Never mind. Come. Bet! Bet! Both sides! Welcome. A gambling place? Don't worry. Know how to play, don't you? You're Oichi's husband. Come, come, I'll help you win. Take more home. Oichi will be glad. Money. Hurry. Bet! Bet! I'd bet on even. Even! Game! 2-6, even! See? Now, you bet as you like. All right, even again! Game! 4-4, even! Great. Better than a pro. A goddess backs me. I'm lucky! Don't let your luck slip away. Bet big. May win a fortune. Even! Don't lose heart yet. I'd bet again. I've no money. I see. Give him more chips. He's my friend's husband. Don't say you don't have it. I lent you 50 ryo. What's up? He can't return the 50 ryo we lent him. I see. Did you try that knowing this is Bunzo Kazama's den? I didn't mean... Be quiet! I'll cut your arm off! Wait, Boss! I know him. Don't be rough. A bother. Bring him. What? Oichi's strength? Yes, I'll buy it for 50 ryo. Good news? 50 ryo just for drawing her sword-cane. She loses nothing. No, she doesn't want to fight any more! Show him. Kyusuke! Refuse and you'll become like him. Oh, my, the sun has sunk. It won't do! My husband will be home soon. The house mustn't be dark! How thoughtless of me. Who is it? Mosaku? Mosaku! So late. You must be hungry. No. You drank? Can't I drink? Even I drink. Oichi, you agree, don't you? Kill a man for us. In short, Boss bought your strong right arm for 50 ryo. Ask Mosaku if you think we lie. Kill a man. If you don't, your dear husband will die. Who's the man? Ask Boss directly about that. We'll come for you tomorrow morning. Gather, everybody! Kyusuke was killed! Let's all go! Gather everybody! We'll all raid his place! I understand their anger but it won't do. Instructor! Is Mosaku at home? Keep him in the house. I'll calm them down. Since Kyusuke was killed, Kazama's men will come for rice, tomorrow. They're all easily roused, there will be bloodshed. You, too, Oichi. If you love Mosaku, stay inside no matter what happens outside. Listen! Oichi. Mosaku! Mosaku... Oichi is going. I don't want to go, but... It was pleasant. Oichi was happy. For a little while, for the first time in my life. Oichi was happy. Ross is at the quarry. Come. I'll go anywhere. Take me. You're...! Oichi! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Who is it? Who are you? I must go! Meddle and I'll kill you! Oichi. Instructor! I said to stay inside. Why'd you come? To kill Bunzo? Please don't stop me and let me go. Didn't you decide not to fight and become happy? I can't help it. A bloody past... You think you've left it behind but it follows you and won't let you alone. My sins must be very great. What about Mosaku? It was a dream. But a beautiful oneâ€” the first time in my life. I don't think I'll ever see such a beautiful dream again. I'll never show others my heart, Just to you before we part, Goodbye, it's goodbye. I miss the days gone by, I cry beneath my traveller's hat... You betrayed us, Oichi. Prepared? You don't care how Mosaku dies? Be still! I vowed never to use my sword-cane again! But you made me do it, so I'll repay you in full for it! THE END
