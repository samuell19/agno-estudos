Sir. Sir. Please stop for a moment. There. Sir! Please wait a moment. I am going inside. -Yes, miss. Miss! Don't stay too long in that house. Yes. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey! Who are you? My name is Melani, what's your name? My name is Omel. Do you want to stay here? Yes, if I can. Can. Many have stayed here. Some for a day,... ...a month, or even a year. Without any fee. They also provide food here. But, once it's dark out, you can't leave this building. Why? Are there many ghosts? Oh, no. It's just the rule here. Oh. Come, follow me. This is my place. Melani, you should meet Madam Liem to ask for permission. Now, you rest in my room first. Here. There's a cake for you. You must be hungry. Thank you for all your kindness. Yes. I'll go find Madam Liem first. Once my work is done, I'll surely be back here. But you will surely come back, right? I can't be far away from you. Hey! Sorry, madam. Who are you? I'm Melani, madam. Are you Madam Liem? What do you want here? I want to stay here madam. I mean, what are you doing in this field? My husband once mentioned about this area! He said he'll only go for a week,... ...but now its been two months and he's still not back. I am so worried about him. That's why I want to look for him here. And now my pregnancy... ...has reached..... -That's enough! You don't need to share about yourself. I allow you to stay here,... ...but don't go near the main building. Yes, madam. -Follow me. Do you believe in ghosts? I mean, do you believe that ghosts are everywhere? When you sleep, walk, in the day or at night. Ghosts are around you. Oh, I don't believe that, but maybe it's there. That is Madam Loan husband's cemetery. Now she's alone in the main building. She believes in the depth of her love. Her husband will come back. So she's waiting there. Come back? How could he come back? I don't have to answer that. Maybe Madam Loan's soul is a bit disturbed... ...because of the depth of her love. Don't make up stories! Go away from here! Leave this place! You have a bad mouth. Go! How could Madam Liem did that? It's getting late already. You don't leave now. You leave in the morning. I will face Madam Liem. She doesn't have any kindness. My heart is not made of steel. I allow you to stay in the next building. This place is not a den of criminals,... ...nor a homeless dump either,... ...or for indiscriminate female farmers. So let me remind you one more time,... ...don't go near the main building. Or I will really throw you out. She does not like anyone there. Yes, okay. I will watch over her. You're lucky that madam allowed you to stay here. I have also permitted her to stay here. Is she pregnant? Right. Hope she enjoys staying here... ...until her belly grows bigger and she delivers. My husband, where are you? I don't want to lose you. I miss you. I will miss you too, Mel. Trust me. Once my work is done,... ...I will come back home. But you will surely come home, right? I can't be far away from you. Of course, Mel. I will surely be home soon. Come on, don't cry. Take care of yourself. You're always sad. They are outsiders going to different directions. They stay here without having to pay. So they are free to come and go. But, they are not casual people. I wonder... I wish to see Madam Loan's face. I have to go. No. No. Madam Liem will be furious. Hey! Don't you know the rules? Sorry madam. I was just looking for some fresh air. The husband that she loved had long passed. She also stays alone, waiting for her husband to come back. She believes her husband will come back. Before her husband passed away,... ...she happily took care of this place. How do you know the story? You are still very young. I heard stories from the elderly who stayed here,... ...and someone told me that Madam Loan is not alone. She used to keep men in that room. Not sure from where are those men. Maybe the voices you heard was from Madam Loan... ...and those men inside the room. Madam. Come in Liem. You are so stubborn. You'll be thrown out later. Sleep. She was just giving food. Giving food to her ghosts? -No, but to her God. Where is that kid? Omel, who is that kid? Why is the kid gone suddenly? Is it a ghost? I am tired of answering. Or was it what Madam Liem asked me the other day? What did Madam Liem ask you? She asked if I believe that ghosts are everywhere. I'm sure you don't believe. I also did not believe it before. This is Madam Loan's food, but she refused to eat it. You eat this, it is good for your fetus. Hey! It's not for you. You wait for the remaining. If you want to see Madam Loan's house more clearly... ...it's from here, near this tree. According to Madam Liem, many have stayed here,... ...and on this tree many have hanged themselves. See. The string is still there. Just go up the ladder. Jump. Dead while swinging. Who has committed suicide here? Residents who lived here. Oh God. Come on. I told you not to come near the main building. Who was that older lady? She is the elder sister of Madam Loan's husband. She also could not come close to the main building. Maybe Loan is scared if she knows that she keeps men. It's been long since she has kept men? Yes. She already had them even before I was born. Hey! Wait! Wait. What is your name? My name is Melani. She's been here before I came. She is Madam Loan's cousin. She's very naughty, she can hurt anyone... ...and she prefers to stay in this building,... ...than the main building. But where is she? Liem! Punish that kid. Put her in the chest. For how long? -Forever. Who is that man who is digging a hole there? Do you think I can ask for help? To help me find my husband around the village. Sure, but not now. It will be dark soon. It's true. People tend to forget about the time here. Suddenly its already two months later. Suddenly it's time to deliver. What do you mean? See. He's not there anymore. No. No way. Sir! Please take me around the village tomorrow,... ...because I am pregnant and I want to find my husband. Sir. Sir. Please. Please don't rape me. Please don't rape me. Please don't. Are you all right? Please don't rape me, I don't want to be hurt. Relax. I'm not a bad person. Don't be sad anymore. I will sleep here tonight, so you will not be disturbed by... ...that grandmother and the small girl. Disturbed? -Yes. For example your legs could be dragged to the yard,... ...fed you with rat intestines or if you have a baby,... ...they might hide the baby in the back yard. She's so mean. Did many people get possessed here? No, there is no such thing here. The ghosts are scared. Liem, how long before she gives birth? Not long now. I can't conceive. Don't let her go. I want the baby. When the baby is in my hands, chase her out of here,... ...or keep her here forever. My husband. Let's go there. My husband! Where are you? My husband! Where are you? My husband! Such a scary place. Why did you say that? Whenever and wherever I go,... ...I feel like someone is watching. Whether it's a human..... -Or a ghost? Yes its a ghost. Or maybe, my husband is here,... ...and he is watching me. She does not like rat intestines. Omel! Omel! Omel! Omel! Omel! Omel! -Help me! What happened to you? -My eyes stings. Why are your eyes stinging? I can't see. Everything is dark. Sorry. I can't help you. I have to leave this place. This place is very scary. You can leave this place after you give birth. This is my last night. I wonder. I want to see how many men is she keeping there? Madam. Madam, I have to leave in the morning. I want to say thank you for allowing me to stay here. Madam. Madam. You're disturbing me. Madam. Mel. Mel. My husband. My husband, you came? Liem! Yes, madam. She should be forced to give birth immediately,... ...so that the baby can me mine. Do it before the moonlight fades away. Hurry up, Liem. -Yes, madam. This room has not been used for a long time. It has also been locked for a long time. Look at the dust. Last night I seemed to hear the sound of someone being dragged. Mel. -Whose room is this? I really don't know. Isn't this the room of that man who was digging yesterday? No. This is my room. I allow you to use it. Drink this. This is good to strengthen... ...your fetus Thank you, madam. Come on, keep pushing. It'll be out soon. Come on. A bit more. Just keep pushing. It's coming out now. Come on. Keep pushing. Come on. Keep pushing. Just a little bit more. I want to throw out your child's placenta. Our child is born! I want to see it. My child. My child. My child. You made me panicked. Melani. Madam Loan wants to see you and your baby in her room. Now? -Yes, now. So Madam Liem,..... -Be quiet. I am talking to her. Listen. If you still want to stay here,... ...follow me and bring your baby. They are here, madam. Come in. Bring that child to me. Yes, madam. Your name is Melani? -Yes. I came here..... -You don't have to continue. I already know. Do you know, for a woman nothing can be more painful... ...than losing someone that you love? I am jealous of you, as you can still have a baby. She's so beautiful. I want you to bring her to me every day. Can you do that? Yes. I can, madam. Liem, take care of this child and her mother. Yes, madam. Now you can go. That girl is a villager, but she is luckier than me. She has a beautiful baby. Too bad. Her father has left them. How long do we have to keep meeting in secret? One day, you will leave me,... ...and I will face my own loneliness. Just like you did. I just want to have a kid! Melani, can I sleep here? I am scared. A wild girl like you is afraid of ghosts? Madam! Madam! I want to drop my child off. Come in. Put her on my bed. You can go. Sorry, madam. My child is still very small. Please allow me to stay here. I can even sit on the floor, madam. You don't trust me? Why? You think I have a nasty disease? I don't think like that, madam. Then what? Say it. After you saw me, what do you think? Do you think I am beautiful? Yes, madam. Who's more beautiful, you or me? I am nothing compared to you, madam. I've always wanted to have my own child. You and your baby reminded me of my past. My body is too weak to conceive. Put the baby on my bed and you can leave. Liem will bring back your baby in the evening. I want to throw your baby's placenta away. Melani. Mel. Melani. Are you deaf? You're just like a princess. Sorry. I didn't know when I dozed off. Remember. Tomorrow morning please send your baby again. Cuen. Where are you? I feel that something is happening outside. Cuen? Cuen. Where have you been? I have been searching for you... ...everywhere but I did not get any clue. I am really sad. You will not leave me, right? You came here to meet me, right? Mel. I'm sorry, Mel. No problem, Cuen. From now on,... ...you and our child should not be separated anymore. You know that I have given birth, don't you? Listen to me carefully, Mel. I'm sorry because all this time,... ...I haven't told you everything about my past. It's all my fault. I did not come to you because..... It was because I came here... ...for another woman here. A woman? Another woman? I don't understand. You mean Madam Loan? Answer me! Answer me, Cuen. So all these while you knew? You knew I am here? And you have slept with a woman who is not your wife. How can you do this to me, Cuen? You lied to me. It's because I'm worried that you can't accept the fact, Mel. Then what about me? What about our child? Are you going to leave us for that other woman? It's better for you to forget about me now, Mel. No! This is not right. You have to accept this fact, Mel. No. No, that's not possible. You have to leave this place, and don't ever come back. No. No! Believe me, Mel. Leave this place, and you will be fine. No! No, Cuen. That is impossible. That is impossible, Cuen. My child? My child. My child. My child. Grandma! Whose baby is that? This baby is dead. Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! Whose dead baby is that? My child! Hey! Crazy woman! Give me back my child! Villagers like you, don't understand everything. What do I not understand? I may be a villager,... ...but I have self-respect. Unlike you, a classy whore who has no shame. A husband snatcher! Shut up! I've never snatched someone else's husband. You're having an affair with Cuen, aren't you? Cuen told me everything. You locked him up,... ...and you forced him to be your sex slave. You're much worse than the slum beggars. Now give me back my child and husband. You don't seem to understand. I never snatched your husband. You were the one who snatched my husband. No, that's a lie! Cuen was married to me before he met you. Cuen is my husband. He came confessing to me, after he slept with you. He came back to me. He won't leave me for a dirty trash like you. No. No. Madam! I want to say thank you. Madam! No. No. That's impossible. That's impossible. That's impossible. That's impossible. I'm telling you for the last time. Keep it in your rotten brain. Cuen is my husband, and you are his mistress. Remember that. Hope that you accept this truth. Don't let me see your stupid face in my house anymore. Before my patience runs out,... ...you can go. Get out! Hey, deaf woman. Didn't you hear me? Get out! Mel. -Cuen? Cuen, let's get out of here. Madam Loan will not see us, come on! I'm sorry, Mel. I can't go with you. I have to continue my work. Cuen, let's get out of here. From now on we can be together. Come on Cuen, let's leave this place. Who is that man who is digging a hole there. Do you think I can ask for help? To help me find my husband around the village. See. He's not there anymore. No. No way. Cuen! Come let's go! What happened? Leave that job. Cuen. Madam. Sir is back. Cuen. Cuen, come! Are you here to ask about the divorce? Is it that simple? Just because, I can't have children with you? No, because I'm sick of you. You are always selfish. I promise. I'll be better. I love you. Everything about us is over. Do you have another woman? Right? Right? Yes. I have another women out there... ...and now she is pregnant with my child. Stop! -Move aside. She buried me here! Go away from this place and don't ever come back again. You can never leave me. No, that's not true. Help! Why am I the one surprised? I am supposed to give her the shock. Help! Help! Melani! I am dead. Liem! You didn't see anything, did you? Yes madam, I didn't see anything. Right! You don't see anything? Yes that's right, madam. I didn't see anything. Liem! I am dead and my body was dragged. No! No way! Melani. -No! You are also dead. No. No way! Don't go! Omel. Is that you? No! This is impossible. This is impossible. My body is cold. My body is cold. My body is cold. Help! Help! No. That's impossible. That's impossible. That's impossible. No! No! Help! You're disturbing me. Before I lose my patience, you can leave. Sir. Sir. Please stop for a moment. Right there. Yes. Sir, please wait for a moment. I want to go inside. Yes, miss. Miss! Don't stay too long in that house. Yes. Oh God. Where's that lady? It's already night time. It's still a long way to get to the village. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
