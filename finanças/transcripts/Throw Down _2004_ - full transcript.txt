First you said you'll do a bank transfer. Then you asked to see me in person but never showed up! Every cheque you gave me bounced! And you gave me a fake ring as down payment! I took it to my friends to show off and the colour came right off! Screw you!! What's your problem? Anybody here? Is anybody here?? What? I'm here for the audition. What audition? Aren't you hiring singers here? Yeah. Sing me a song. "I can't calm myself down, because of love. I stare at the stars alone, because of love.

It's taken care of. Taken care of... Stop the bus. Stop the bus! You pay first. Pay you later. Bastard. God... damn... it. Die! Call that asshole Deadbeat. Garbage... garbage... Let's fight! We need coins. You pay first. I'll pay you back. Change them all. Move faster, dumbass. Can't you duck? Something must be wrong with your brain. Boss, Deadbeat said it's almost ready. What's almost ready? Almost dead is more like it. Bullshit. You have 3 minutes. I'll see if you can make it. Are you a man or a pig? You sure stink like a pig! KO! I won't let you win any rounds. You're better off being Spam, you fat pig. Why is he that excited? Are you really that good? Let's fight. Think I'm scared? Do you know how to play? Brother Keung, Brother Chiu.

The red is for punching and the green is for kicking. The money's all here, boss. Wait! Red is for punching and green is for kicking, idiot. Is that your brain or your ass in your head? How many minutes late? Sorry, Brother Savage. We're going now. Hold it. Wait. Next time, don't show up if you're half a minute late. Go. Szeto Bo! Recognise me? Do you recognise me? - Sure. - Really? So, who am I? Say it. You may not recognise me, but I sure recognise you. Your nickname was Judo Golden Boy. Recognise me now? - Yes. - Really? Who am I then? Say it. I recognise you but you don't recognise me. I used to practice Judo too. I've fought you once. Tea time. Well? How did I do? I should at least be rewarded! Sure... Thanks. Thanks. You promised you would fight me. Sure, sure... He can't breathe. Hey, he can't breathe. He's suffocating! Are you all right? This is yours. What is it? Barbecue. Good luck, boss! Have a smoke! No. 4. $50,000! - Let's go. - What? - Lost everything. - You lost everything?! All 50 grand?? Dealer. 9 Dots! I was on a winning streak! He ruined my luck! - Where's your $3,000? - What?! You gave it to me! Give it back. I need to play again or I'll be in trouble tonight. - Give it to me. - It's mine! - It's my money! - Give it back! Sorry. Do I have the job? What's my salary? $800 a set. Each set is 6 hours. What about 3-hour sets? They'll be totalled up. Any overtime? $133 or $134 per hour? You have to make it clear. We'll talk about it later. What's wrong with you? What are you up to? Got more money on you? Get it from an ATM! I need to pay up my debt tonight, or I'm dead. Help me out. So why gamble your money away? Got any money? $10,000? $8000? I'll start working here tonight. I won't go away until you fight me for real. Do I start tonight? Give me a hand. Keung? I've got some cheap booze for you.

Mona, your agent and Brother Savage Want to see you. Tony, Brother Savage wants to see you. Boss. What's up? You can't just leave as you wish, miss. Let's fight. Here's the money. I invested a lot in you. You forced me into prostitution! Master. Think I'm scared? - Let's play "Fists". - I don't know how. I'm Jing. I'll be Sanshiro Sugata, and you'll be Higaki. I only put you in movies. What prostitution? You forced me to do adult movies. That's prostitution. - Know "15-20"? - Nope. - How about "One Two"? - Nope. We haven't been getting any students at the Dojo. - Showing just your tits? - No way. So which game do you play, you idiot? Stone paper scissors. I want someone to fight the tournament... - Partial nudity? - No way. ...and to make a name for the Dojo. - The money is short! - But you signed the contract. - I just want to be a singer. - I'm working on it. Stone paper scissors. What am I gonna say to the shareholders? It's OK if the bar doesn't make any money. But your numbers have to add up. Then come back and finish the movie. You forced me into prostitution! Wait. I'm working on it... The shareholders wanted me to call the police. You're not fulfilling your contract. Looks like I'll have to find your dad in Tainan. I'm loaning this to you. Here. Thanks, thanks. Here you go, Boss. Hey, lend me some money. I practice Judo, too. Here's the collateral. Jing, don't play with your drink. Again. Stone paper scissors! I'm getting old, and Jing's condition hasn't improved. Can you help me out? Bo... Szeto Bo! Here's the collateral. I'll go get the money. Wait. Wait. Wait. Sorry... Got a cigarette? $2 a smoke. I don't have a place to stay. I'll sleep here tonight. Can I crash here? Szeto Bo! Szeto Bo! Szeto Bo? What? Sorry. Mona. Mona. Mona? What? Sorry. Bo? Bo? Bo. What? Sorry. You filthy couple. So cheap... so cheap... You can't even get yourselves a room? What's wrong with you two? Garbage. Tea time. They're mine first! This is yours. Where's mine? Surveillance video. So you need money? You may not recognise me, but we knew each other. If you need money, just tell me. So, what now? Others are laughing their asses off. What should I do? What do you want me to do? Well? Well?? The storage room is low on liquor. What's with you?? Order more right away! I'm talking here, asshole. Well, Bo? I'm talking here, asshole. Mona, where's my money? You pimp. You never showed up for our match 2 years ago. It's a pity I couldn't fight you then. But today... You're not worthy anymore. I'm Jing. I'm Fatty. I'll be Sanshiro Sugata, and you'll be Higaki. Oh yeah... He is good, he is good... I am Lee Kong. This is the only technique I use. You've challenged my Dojo before. Come Again. Please register your name at the office, first. Thanks. No. 48? Thanks. I'm sorry. - I can sing many songs. - No. 49. Mandarin songs, English songs... You're beyond our age requirement. Did you not read the application? Why can't you give me a chance? It won't hurt! "JUDO CHAMPIONSHIP TOURNAMENT" "MASTER CHENG YAT SUN" Wise up, four-eyes. You must rank last in your class. I left home 30 minutes early, but a car accident held up the traffic. So I took the subway, but their signal system broke down. So I ran here. Sorry, Brother Savage. The money's all here, Boss. Wait. I'm going now, Brother Savage. Wait. You're such a lousy opponent, four-eyes. Goal! Crying like a baby. Act like you've got a pair! Now go. Animal suits? That's a new one. Open it. Need money? Take it. Tea time. - You recognise my master, right? - Sure. Where's the restaurant? Around the corner. I'll wait for you here. Over here! Sit. I'm Jing. I'll be Sanshiro Sugata, and you'll be Higaki. He told me to stay and said that you'd come in yourself. Careful, it's hot. Any rice or spaghetti to go with this? Yes, extra charge. Forget it then. It's been a while since we had a meal together. At first, I didn't think I'd make it. But now I'm getting used to the training. I'm in great shape now. I'm full of confidence. The commitment makes me feel younger. I wish the match was tomorrow. Jing, don't play with your drink. You only have to buy me this meal. Come see me fight if you have time. Cheer me on. What is it? Barbecue. No. 4 tiles! Ready! Show it! $100,000? You think you're on a streak, asshole? - Doubling up?? - Hey, that's enough. Time's up! Hand! Bad hand... Bad hand! Fine. Show it! I won't lose to you! Again! We should go. We should go. You have over $400,000 already. This is for half a mil! One more game. Bet it all! Winning this round is all I need! Hand! Let's see your hand! How dare you, you bitch?! After them! Hurry!! The money! The money!! I'm sorry, boss... Need to go to a hospital? Medicinal oil is good enough. Total is $28,000. We'll split it. Forget it. You can't go back to the parlour anyway. I'm looking for ways to go to Japan. I don't think I can be a singer in Hong Kong. I hope to make it in Japan. What's so funny? Are you laughing at me?? I can make it. I'm cute! I have a nice body! Japanese love my type! - Now pay attention. - Yes! I just fought Lee Kong. He was really something. His technique was so fast. I just couldn't beat him. What happened to your arm? He dislocated it. Why do you go around picking fights? You probably won't believe me. I have a hereditary eye disease. It's Glaucoma. I'll lose eyesight gradually, and become totally blind eventually. You better fight him soon then. Koka ! Waza-Ari ! Ippon ! Match is over! What happened? He became unconscious after he was thrown down. You won't need them. You won't need them. We don't need to bring these. We'll put him in a temporary care centre, Mr Szeto. He'll receive daytime training, then he'll be assigned to a permanent home. Let's go, Jing. Szeto Bo? I've come up with a new technique, using only one arm. I've checked with every record label in Tokyo. I can't help you. What about TV stations? Film studios? - I can act too! - I'm very sorry. How about a portfolio? - Swimsuit? Nudes? - I can't help you. - How about AV ? Please? - I can't help you. - Help me out. Is this enough? - No... - Please? - No. Jing? You can't just leave the care centre like this. Come back with me. Give me the flyers. Good boy. We'll go back now. Jing! Time to eat! I'm starving. There's no food here. Let's go eat outside. - I'm hungry. - We'll go and eat now. Thanks. Just one arm? In just one move? $100. I'll raise it to $500! Hold it. Thanks. It's all arranged. I'll fight Lee Kong tomorrow. How can you act like there's nothing wrong with you? - We're on. - What? - Your eyes. - What about my eyes? You said you were going blind! I made that up! I just like to challenge others to fight me. Pure and simple. But people either don't believe me or think that I do it for a reason. So I just made up one. And you know what? That actually got people to fight me. "CHENG YAT SUN, JUDO SENSEI" Have you seen my father? He's not here. I'm Jing. I'll be Sanshiro Sugata, and you'll be Higaki. Jing, don't play with your drink. Eat. I want to fight you. I'm Jing. I'll be Sanshiro Sugata, and you'll be Higaki. I want to fight you, "Little Judo Bully". You recognise me now, you bastard? You owe me a lot, asshole. You can never pay me back in your lifetime! But I'll give you a discount. Boss? I want to fight you. Have you cleared the books yet? Not yet. Come on!! Again!! Get up! Again! Same technique again? Yup. Your agent paid me a visit. I already paid him the damages. I've found another agent. I want to go to Japan. I want to become famous there. You said the same thing about Taipei when you were in Tainan, and the same thing about making it in Hong Kong. It's Japan now? I'm not afraid of setbacks. I don't want to have regrets later. At least I knew I did my best. I was like you when I was younger. I could never have imagined the kind of success I'd have today. But... I've already lost a wife. I don't want to lose a daughter too. If you end up not making it in Japan, then where else will you go next? Thanks. Goodbye. Don't run away! Uncle, no! Let go of me! Take care of yourself, dad! Take care! You take care! I'll make it in Japan! I'll make it in Japan!! Do you think I can block Lee Kong's move? I want to fight him. Why the sudden urge? You probably won't believe me, but I have a hereditary eye disease. Glaucoma is the cause. I'll gradually lose sight in both eyes, and I'll go blind in the end. Postcard for you. "I'll come back and buy you dinner after I become famous. Mona. 2004 summer, Tokyo." Szeto Bo wants to finish his match with you from 2 years ago. Please give him a chance. Please give him a chance. Bow. Begin! I've lost. Match over! END
