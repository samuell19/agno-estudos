MASS PSYCHOSIS ???? He shoots the ball! He catches it! The halftime whistle is near. And... Goal! Goal! He outplays his opponent, tears toward the goal. Now! Now he will shoot! Yes! Goal! The match is still 3 to 3. Maybe one team can pick itself up. Money transfer. Our team tries to distract the opponent with long passes. There's a chance! Excuse me. Excuse me! What do you want? - Where can I make a call to Munich? Over there. Hello? It's me. - Finally. What's she saying? - The little one must go to bed. When will you come? You promised her to be on time. Tell her dad always keeps his word. Especially on his birthday. - She made a stitchery. What? She stitched? Tell her... I haven't forgotten... The doll... I'll bring it with me. Hurry up. - I will. Send my love. Excuse me. - Is the thing not working? Everything alright. 1.50 Mark. The picture. - What picture? There's a chateau on the calendar over there. Where? - In the phone booth. Yes. It looks familiar. Do you know the chateau? Is it nearby? I wouldn't know. Anything else? - No. It looked familiar. Sorry to bother you. Goal! Goal! Goal! In the final minute! You're late. I expected you earlier. Why? Your coming was announced. Me? It must be a mistake. I'm here only by chance. But you wanted to rent the chateau. - Me renting? What gives you that idea? The owners called that someone wanted to rent the chateau. Why else would you be here? I saw the chateau on a calendar. And when I drove by... and saw it from the street... But you cannot see the chateau from the street. I get it. You won't tell you're interested because of the rent. But it's not that high. The owners are reasonable. At a first appearance... Maybe my family and I actually should spend the summer here. Think it over. Don't buy a pig in a poke. Take a close look around. The next time. - I'll show you. The power is not on yet. The owners are money-saving. I keep it filled up. Come. Hunting was her passion. And she was somewhat odd. That was her kind of humour. Know what I mean? You look tired. Do you want a hot tea? - No, thanks. I prepared the bedroom. But I'm not staying. She shot at everything that moved. After her husband's death... They removed a fist-sized fungus from his brain... She never came back. I don't understand... When did you arrive? - Hello? It's me. - Who is this? Can't you tell? Who is 'me'? - Greta. Are you alone? - But... Make sure that the old man leaves. Tell him you will sleep it over. We bail out at night. But... - Don't worry. I thought it all out. Hello? Hello? When did you arrive? Can't tell exactly. What is it? Don't you trust me? Why are you here? - And you? It's our only way out. No one will ever know why we are here. Did you deal with the old man like we agreed? Did you tell him you want to rent? I can't remember. You must remember what you told him. I don't know. I don't know anything. I must have overstrained in the last few days. The long drive... I don't know what to explain... Nothing at all. It is all right. But that's... I don't think you can go with me. I can't make sense of it. It all could be true. Don't play-act. It's all behind us. Why are you afraid? - I'm not afraid. I just don't know what to do. It's cold. There's hot tea the kitchen. No one will be hurt by his death. He once told me himself on a passage to New York. He told me about his life insurance. He even joked about it. He said the insurance sum was so high no insurance company could afford his death. Only to lovers he was stingy. He wanted to be loved, not his money. I'll be able to forget. I sometimes ask myself if you are all worth it. If any man is worth it. What women are doing for them... But... The lighter. Fingerprints. Daddy! Where have you been? Where have you been so long? We worried about you. Did you bring me a doll? Let's light the candles. The kid is ready for bed. Where's my doll? - The poem first. "My heart is pure" - "My heart is pure" "and you shall be in it." - "and you shall be in it." "Only you my dear daddy." - "Only you my dear daddy." And now the present. And a kiss. Let her give you a kiss. She wants to congratulate you on your birthday. Will he like it? And now the doll. - Yes! It's in the car. I'll get it. - No, stay. You can get it yourself. Half-past eleven. She should be in bed. Why aren't you talking? I... I don't know what to say. There is nothing to say. I'm simply tired. That's all. I'm tired. Have a night's rest. Tomorrow is another day. Let's celebrate tomorrow. After 35 years, one more night doesn't make a difference. You think so? Look mummy! How beautiful! It's gorgeous. What a dear daddy, right? Come honey, let's get to bed. Daddy is tired too. I'll take her to bed. The suitcase can wait till tomorrow. I have to do something. Don't touch it! Give it to me. Why aren't you in bed? What do you want? It's late. You should go to bed. What are you waiting for? Go to bed! Why are you looking at me like that? Are you afraid of me? Why are you afraid? Why would I be afraid? I'm sorry... You gave me a peculiar look. A look like... One you'd give a lunatic. But I'm no lunatic. The cup! It would not be here if it was all made up by a lunatic. Take a good look. Don't you see it? It's a cup. Why are you showing me this? Because of this little red spot. Take a good look at it. Fingerprints! She had it in her hands. Get it? I don't. Maybe it's all a dream. Even me talking to you. No, Harry, you're awake. You're overworked. Ask a doctor. I'll go today. Not to a doctor but to the Police. I have to know who the woman was and the dead man. Thank god you brought this to me Else you'd be held as a mental case. That's her? Yes. That's her. Let's talk over there. The young lady has a considerable criminal record. Everything you told me. And you are certain? Definitely. It all could be true, up to the last detail. There's one small flaw: The date. You could not possibly have met her on your 35th birthday. Why not? Because the lady is dead for 35 years. Dead? She was killed in a shootout with the Police the night after the incident. Not only had she the body of the financier in the car but she also committed another murder. Her accomplice. He too was topped. Her accomplice? Why? - Who would know? You asked me to identify her fingerprints. That's all, right? How do you explain that those prints match the ones from back then? I don't. The Police has to establish facts. We can only tell you what we know. And what is in the files. Believe me that this really happened. If you want someone to believe you go to a priest. If he won't help go to a doctor. Thanks. METEMPSYCHOSIS = OCCUPATION BY THE SOUL OF A DEAD MAN. DR.MED. CARL WICKLAND, CALIF. USA = THIRTY YEARS AMONG THE DEAD = SOULS THAT KEEP HUMAN QUALITIES... SEARCHING FOR A BODY... TAKE POSSESSION OF A LIVING BODY... THEY STAY AT THE PLACE OF THEIR WORLDLY LIVES... A POSSESSED APPEARS TO THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM AS MENTALLY ILL... ...Without patients comprehending their emotions. The body is under inexplicable traumatic pain. The pain gets so big, it thwarts rational thinking. This results in suicide. Often patients try to suppress their emotions. To overplay them with eccentric behaviour. And they delay the act to another time. Therefore it is important to watch out for these symptoms. Thank you for your attention. Yesterday I was waiting until 7 for you. You could have called. - Don't make a scene. You know I have to take the trip. I made a promise. One thing you'd better understand... That you're too chicken to tell them the truth. My daughter is at an age where she needs her father. Try to understand. What's wrong? We are going the day after tomorrow. I have the travel route all planned out. We go to... Wherever we like. Where it's nice. For sure? - Scout's honour. Why are you driving so fast? Stop, let me drive. Step off the gas. Are you mad? I told you to stop! Your daughter is here to! We're not alone in the car! Stop! We are not alone in the car! Debbie! Debbie! Debbie! IN LOVE, YOUR DEBBIE I thought spiders don't come out this time of year. I've seen mother this morning. What do you mean? Someone who looked like her? I don't know. I'm sorry, but you must realize that your mother has passed. I know, you told me a hundred times. But you don't believe it. - What's that you say? You're the only one I trust. Am I sick? You must tell me. No. You're not sick, but... You've to regain your composure. You loved her. You loved her very much. That's why it is hard to live without her. Why won't you help me? There's nothing I'd like to do more. But if you don't help yourself, I'm powerless. Try to remember the accident. She is dead. You have to think about her as gone. Even when it's painful. I will try. I will try everything. That's my mother. That's my mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! What do you want? I'm sorry. A young girl collapsed in the street. She's unconscious. Fortunately, I was able to place her at my clinic. According to witness reports she suddenly collapsed. In the middle of the street. Then she ran towards a car yelling 'Mother!'. Not only is she seeing her and constantly talking about her. She sometimes even speaks to her. Yes... Good morning. Come to my office. You've refurnished again. - I rearrange it every three days. I'm busy. How old is she anyways? Seventeen. It's obvious that she idolizes you. Did she ever have an illness with mental implications? No. She was always healthy. Exceptionally healthy. I can't believe she's ill. But she is. Meaning that...? Meaning that she will stay here. To get well again. Alright. I'll come back in the evening. - But don't go to her room. When someone is ill you keep away the microbes. In this case you are a microbe. Because I spoil her? That has never done any good. You were easing your conscience. We all do it. Did Debbie know about your private lives? No. Helene was careful. She never got agitated in front of her. I was not under the impression Debbie knew about our situation. Are you sure she didn't know about the other woman? What other woman? - I don't know her name. Masha. She's talking about the accident. Factual, in all its details. She remembers exactly how it happened. Maybe better than you. I'm glad. Until tomorrow, then. When will she return? I will pick her up tomorrow morning. She isn't allowed into the house for now. Where are you going? I guess to the seaside. And... If I'd show up? You won't do that. You'd never do that, right? Best we never meet again. And promises... must be kept. Right? You are healthy and she is ill. Think it's easy for me to lose you forever? You just said forever. What would happen if I... Let's say... I'd take my life? You should be ashamed. Let me be generous for once. What else could I give you as a parting gift? To stay young and beautiful like you are now. Twice as young as I am old. Even if it's for another man. You in my bed... It was silly from day one. One day you'll sense it too and then it would be my turn. Goodbyes don't get easier with age. And would you kill yourself for me? There's no fool like an old fool. Especially relating to someone like you. Do you love me? Why won't you say it? Let me hear it one more time. Why would a smart creature like you asks such foolish questions? Look... I wouldn't have to run away if it wasn't true. Would you be mad if I'd kill myself? I don't know. Everyone has the right to. But as a professor of pathology... Without trying to influence you, I could share practical information. I work a lot with dead people. Three or four times a week... Believe me... Death is very final. There's no waking up from. Contrary to this is waking up from a love affair only a question of a clear view. Clear view? How clear? A young medicine student... Who looks for self-affirmation from her professor... Picks him from his life into her life, into her bed. You don't really love me. I'm not blaming you. That's a simple fact. We never love the other person. We only love ourselves through others. Like you the professor, the mirror of your vanity. Isn't that true? 11.20 Marks. Could you please switch off the lights? Okay. Is she coming back? How did you get here? With a taxi. But he said... I was going to pick you up tomorrow. And nobody considered that I can't travel with just one dress. Have you packed or should I help you? That can wait till tomorrow. But you just asked me a question. What was it? If she'll come back. And will she come back? You knew about it? We all knew. But she never talked about it. You know how mother was. And that day... You came down the stairs. A girl walked to her car. Then you walked to us. Didn't you know we all died once because of that girl? It's by chance that only mother is dead. She wanted it that way. I think a lot about her. But differently. I feel sorry. It's great to be alive. No? And that she is dead... is that my fault? No. You loved someone and you wanted to go your own way. Are you sure? That's for you to know. I just don't want to be in your way. If you have to make a decision you need to decide. I've already made a decision. I have decided. Yes? She's here. Everything is alright. We go tomorrow morning. I will get back to you. Goodbye. Debbie! What happened? Nothing... nothing at all. Someone screamed. Screamed? How? A name. What name? Masha. How do you know her name? Isn't that her name? How's my angel? How do you feel? Better? - Much better. Drink this to help you sleep. Much better. Good night, child. - Good night. Don't forget the medicine. My farewell gift. It's my farewell gift. What? It's my farewell gift. What did you say? - My farewell... My farewell gift. - What are you saying? Promises must be kept! Listen! Debbie! - Beloved! Why aren't you saying it? I want to hear it one more time! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Come... come... Did I hurt you? Let me help you. Please... Take me back to the white room. I'm save there. I can't... not any longer, father. Alright, dear. Help me. Please help me. Scalpel. Call the hospital. It's me. How is she? We don't understand... TELEPATHY = MENTAL COMMUNICATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS, FEELINGS, THOUGHTS FROM ONE PERSON TO THE NEXT ... INDEPENDENT OF THE KNOWN SENSORY ORGANS.

RHINE, DUKE UNIVERSITY EVERY FIFTH PERSON TESTED SHOWED TELEPATHIC ABILITIES ... Your daughter just got married and you're cracking jokes. A wedding is no tragedy after all. What's going on? Step back and let the car pass. Keep driving. - What's he on about? Why the allergic reaction to our poor Policemen? Please drive that way over there. Who's protesting this time? It's just a simple detour. - I see! Take the detour then. Her smoking will cost you an arm and a leg. I'm afraid so. - But that's not my problem anymore. You should be financing your parenting errors. I love you. Keep walking. Get out of the car. Do you have to smoke? Actually... I married you so I can smoke freely. That's a real love confession. May I? May I take this too? - I'll keep it. Do you like it? The taste of your father-in-law. You've made the choice. Barbara. Barbara! Where are you? Hello! Hello! Yes? Can you give me a lift? Where do you want to go? - To a station. Surely. Barbara! I would not hitch rides as a young woman. With those nasty things written in the papers. Please, do get in. Cigarette? No, thanks. Milan, one-way. Express train from Austria to Italy on platform seven. Thank you for coming. I knew you'd come. I thought a lot about you. Especially now... With the big celebration. You were finally looking into a mirror. And now you are here. That's what you wanted, right? Yes. Do you really think she was kidnapped? There's no other explanation. My marriage was in all the newspapers. The fortune of my parents-in-law... ...are well known. A sneaky bunch... and deliberate, too. They knew very well that neither I nor my parents-in-law would want to make headlines with this story. But how can you find her outside the public's eye? We must follow every possible lead. Then we need a picture for the search. Maybe someone recognizes her. Maybe you're right. We should wait with the statements until I've spoken with her parents. Did you call me? Is the clock scaring you? Don't be embarrassed. As a kid I too was scared of clocks. I built this one to get rid of the fear. Clocks are eerie. They recall death. But do not have such bad thoughts. I'll turn it off if you'd like. Go to sleep. You must never be afraid. I'm always with you. Do you understand? You can sense me. You can always sense me. Of course I informed the Police. Please, stay at home. Someone must stay at the phone. Right. I'll be with you in a few hours. Alright, see you. Please, have a seat. One more thing... Would you do me a favour? - Surely. Could you have mine and her parents phones tapped? Have a seat. One shouldn't worry about dieting on a honeymoon trip. Help yourself. I hope nothing's missing. It's not your fault. Maybe the glass wanted to break? Maybe a glass has it's own feelings. To burst into a thousand pieces, for example. It may sound crazy but I really mean it. Why do we assume that things, that don't live a life like we do, are dead? Why the look? Don't you believe me? One takes a glass... drinks from it. Then cleans it, puts it away. And that's it. Sometimes something else happens too. Don't laugh. Something unexpected. It breaks into a thousand pieces. It bursts. Haven't you seen it on TV? In front of a million viewers. One man spooked the whole world with it. He made broken clocks tick again. Some thought it was a miracle. I don't believe in miracles. Rather a brilliant hoax. Maybe just a coincidence. It's always called a coincidence when people can't comprehend things. I'm no magician. I can't guarantee anything. Sometimes they won't listen. This one is especially stubborn. It means to make a fool of me. Maybe just a coincidence. Just coincidence, believe me. Yes, that's her. She wouldn't even accept a cigarette. Hold on! She's a heavy smoker! I didn't know. But it was obvious that something was wrong. Didn't she say anything? She wasn't exactly talkative. She just stared dead ahead. Well, she did say I should take her to a station. What was the station? Do you like her? I have no understanding of paintings. - I know. I'm talking about her. She's likable. You can have her. Who's the girl anyway? She's no girl. She's a woman. She's married and on her honeymoon. She's married? - In a civil marriage. They weren't in bed yet. She loves her husband... very much so. I don't know him. But I wasn't sure she'd come. He could have been stronger. Now she's here anyways. So think about it. A pleasure shared is a pleasure doubled. It wouldn't be the first time. Why do you assume the right to toy with people like that? Do I? You pick any face and any body but you don't care one bit what will become of your toy. One jumped from the sixth floor. Who? - The Dutch girl. You knew her. Yes, I slept with her. She talked about you one day. And then she didn't come back. So? - But that's the point! You don't touch them, you don't need them! I need them more than anyone else. Don't you get it? I must have them all. You know exactly why. Because I can't have any. A cripple doesn't ask the price. A cripple isn't at fault to be born that way. I didn't want to stay one. I realized that willpower is enough to make them dance to my piping. Like that Dutch girl. Would you do me a favour? No. Don't be like that. It won't hurt. At least not you. Come. Afraid of a soaked girl? He's a bit shy. Forgive him, he's my best friend. Do you like him? Show him that you like him. Show him that you like him! See! You shouldn't have done that. You won't do it again. You're mad. I won't take part in your games anymore. It's over now. Your pain is gone. But don't forget it. I can't protect you all the time when someone else tries to touch you. I don't want them to hurt you. I know the pain. It's all over, not just in your mouth. In the whole body. When someone touches you... That's the way you are. It's not your fault. You'll stay like that as long as I want it. Did you understand? - Yes. Everything was alright. She would have told me if there was a problem. There was one thing... It only comes to mind only because it has to be something. True. She once was in Milan with a female friend. Go on. Of course she knew the streets well. Suddenly on the street she couldn't remember a thing. Not where she was going... nor what she was up to. She walked back up the street to a man who seemingly was waiting for her. The man told her he knew that she'd come back and where she would go. So? - Well... He wrote down his name and address. Strange... - Yes? Only a few hours later she regained her bearings. She was sitting on a bench. We never spoke about it. The address? She threw away the note. I never thought much about it. Well. Everyone has blackouts sometime. Absences. - Right. In the kitchen is everything you need. The fridge is filled. You won't starve. I'm back in a few days. I'll never leave. I will be here always. You know that, don't you? Don't feel like a prisoner. Even when I ask you not to leave the house for a few days. They may be looking for you. We both want to avoid one thing: That they find you. Looking for someone? - The young lady. Is she out of town? - She's dead. Plunged from the balcony. Why did she do it? - Are you a relative? Just a friend. Were you happy? [Italian] [Italian] What do you want? Barbara? Get dressed first. May I help you? If you're a magician. I need a new generator. I don't know magic. A car repair shop would be better suited. Wanna look for one? - If you have a free seat. Get in, you're freezing. - Okay. Cigarette? - No. Right, he can't stand cigarette smoke. You're not bothered if I smoke, right? Forgive my late visit but his friend called me. He told me my son wouldn't be here tonight. I could talk to you alone. You are... Right. Girls should be careful when stopping strangers at night. The newspapers are full of nasty stories. That's why I don't read papers. Besides, a killer looks differently. How would you know? From all the killers that killed me so far. You have to come up with something else if you try to intrigue me. You don't understand. You're so young. One has a special love for a sick child. Would you help me? Why? You'll only listen to me from now on. Not to him. I won't leave you for one second. I will bring you back to the people you belong to. As long as you're under... ...under his control you have to be protected. You're in danger. If it's true what his friend said, one girl has died already. A girl like you. The Police said it was a suicide. But was it really? There's not much going on anyway. I'll pick up the car. If the phone rings, please tell them I'll be back. Excuse me. Could we have something to drink? Stop it. I'm just as good a waitress as you're a driver. Are you always this talkative? Think we could have an interesting discussion? You must do something else if you're not a killer. Right? You will forget all about it. It will be like this never happened. It's all fixed! Ciao! Can I help you? I think so. The porter will pick up the luggage. Champagne! [Italian] Femininity, looking for itself in every mirror every shred of glass. Even in the gaze of men. To not have it is just as bad as for the man not to reflect it. There's no use in talking about it. I will not ask about it. Barbara! Barbara! Barbara... Barbara! [Italian gibberish] Barbara!
