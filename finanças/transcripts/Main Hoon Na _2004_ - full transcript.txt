Can we hope for the same gesture of humanity from Pakistan? I can't speak to the Indian Army General like this.. let's simplify this.. - Sir, General Bakshi has arrived! Already? - Should I ask him to go back? Cameras off! No cameras before the show begins Are you in charge here? - Yes sir! Not anymore! I'm Brigadier Shekhar Sharma. The General's security is my responsibility Any problems with that? - Not at all sir! Good! Capt. Vikram, Major Abbas.. over there Major Karan in position. Come with me Sir, security camera is in position. - Good! All positions secured? - Yes sir. All positions secured Good. Let the show begin Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to `People's Voice' I'm your host, Rajat Saxena and today's issue is.. Project Milaap (Unity), a historic step or a historic mistake? The dawn of 15th of August, our Independence Day.. will see 50 Pakistani prisoners in Indian custody released.. at the Indian border Let's meet the man behind Project Milaap Please welcome General Amar Singh Bakshi.. the Commander in Chief of the Indian Army We'd first like to congratulate you sir, because.. ..the Parliament actually agreed to Project Milaap this very morning! General Bakshi, do you really believe that Project Milaap.. ..will lead to friendship between India and Pakistan? It's not so simple. A chasm of fifty five years.. ..cannot be bridged by releasing fifty prisoners Then why Project Milaap? - It's a step.. to cover the miles. So according to you they are all innocent! None of them are terrorists or ISI agents? If we had a shred of doubt that they are dangerous to India.. we would never have taken this step. Most of them are poor villagers.. ..who didn't even know they had crossed the border After all the border is not completely sealed. They didn't even have weapons.. ..yet they have been in our prisons for years.. some since 1971 We feel it's time to send them back home. But not everyone agrees with you General. Some even want to stop you. Everyone has the right to free speech in a democracy! But some people don't want to merely speak. Sir, I'm talking about Raghavan. The people would like to know who Raghavan is.. ..and is it true that he has sworn to stop Project Milaap? Raghavan is a mask. He hides his face because of his shame. He's a coward - a terrorist.. ..so used to violence that he now fears peace Project Milaap will be successful. The prisoners will certainly be released on the dawn of 15th August Damn! Back up! We need back up immediately. Come in. Major Ram reporting, sir! I'm outside the studio. Maj. Ram, hold position for Two minutes! Back up is arriving. Just two minutes. It's too late, sir. I'm going in Hello General. I'm Raghavan. I'll ask you the remaining questions. So General.. ..I'm sure Pakistan is also releasing our poor villagers, right? Exactly what I was going to ask him! When elders speak, learn to shut up! So General, what about Pakistan's show of good will? We haven't heard anything from Pakistan yet Then why are we being so damn foolish? Because someone has to take the first step If we all behave like you, there will never be peace We've thought about this a lot. And we are certain that Pakistan will reciprocate Pakistan! Pakistan is going to laugh at us.. ..because they don't want peace. - Why? Don't the Pakistanis love their children? You do, General! You love your daughter a lot. I'm really sorry. She will really miss you, General No one can save you now Ram! Ram! Easy now. You'll be all right, Sharma Ambulance is on the way I want to speak to my son Ram.. Ram.. Father.. Doctor! - Ram! Ram.. - Father.. Ram.. Please.. Was I a good father? - Yes father, but right now.. No, tell me! You're the best father in the whole world I'm guilty, son! - No, father Ram, listen please! Please.. Yes. There's something I've always hidden from you You.. You're not my only son. I have a wife, Madhu. And a son, Lakshman.. ..your step.. your brother! Who I haven't seen for twenty years. It's been twenty years since she left me. Twenty years I have lived away from them. It's time I pay for my deeds. - Don't say this father. I knew you'll forgive me Ram. Your heart is big. But until she forgives me I will not find peace. My family will remain broken.. scattered. Promise me Ram, that you will not immerse my ashes alone.. ..that both my sons will do my last rites Where is father's family? Son, they left nineteen years back. Because I came here, right? Dear Shekhar, I know you consider what happened between us.. ..ten years back a big mistake I stayed away from you as I knew how much you loved your wife. But today I'm helpless. By the time you get this letter I may not be alive. I leave our son in your care. Please look after him. He is your son, too. What's your name, son? - Ram Sharma, sir! Madhu.. please. It was just a mistake. It was just a mistake. - Mistake? After marriage it's called Infidelity, Shekhar. I'm leaving. I can't live with this lie anymore. Lie? Are you calling our marriage, our son a lie? And what about the one who is sitting outside.. ..your illegitimate son? He's a truth too. And if he enters the house, I am leaving. Where will he go? It's not his fault. You're right Shekhar. It's not his fault. It's my fault for having trusted you. For my sake.. ..because of me, father stayed away from his family. I will bring them home. They won't come home, son, not till you're here. You can't go anywhere at this stage, Ram. I need you till 15th August. - I know, sir. But I made a promise to my father. Then go ahead. Project Milaap was his dream too. Ram, this is the photograph Raghavan gave me. It's my daughter Sanjana, in her college in Darjeeling. This picture was taken from her college. A gun can reach where a camera can. And it's my worst fear. Sir, why don't you call her back? - Because she won't agree. Even if her life's in danger? - You don't know my daughter, Ram. I haven't seen her for two years. She hates me. Of course, it's my fault entirely. I never let her come close to me. I wanted a son. A son, who would join the army like me. That's why I never loved her.. ..like I would've loved my son. I was wrong. Today I can give anything to catch her glimpse.. ..but she won't let me. Sir, can we not send a 24 hour Protection Team for her surveillance? Sanjana will never let anyone in a uniform come close to her. If anyone does, she will run away .. she's done it before. So what do you recommend sir? - I want you.. ..to go to Darjeeling, under cover to protect Sanjana I don't trust anyone else. I'm sorry, sir. It's impossible for me to go to Darjeeling right now. I thought you may be interested in this mission.. ..as there's another student, Lakshman Sharma, studying there Lakshman. Your father and I've been friends for 25 years. I know everything. Call it fate or co-incidence.. ..but his wife Madhu and his son Lakshman live in Darjeeling. You are now officially on leave till 15th August I've already spoken to the Principal of St. Paul's. You are joining the college from Monday. Sir.. And what subject will I teach there? You are not going there as a teacher .. you will be a student. Student.. I'll look really strange as a student, sir I think I'm better off as a teacher. - You can't stay with Sanjana.. ..all the time as a teacher. - But I just don't look like a student. Besides, it's been ages since.. ..I attended the national Defence College Don't worry. Even the principal will say that you are there.. ..to complete your graduation which was left incomplete. But sir, the current generation..? I've never even seen a civil college I'll be caught in a day! - Ram, no matter what.. Project Milaap cannot stop! Sir. Those prisoners have to be released on 15th August. But Sanjana's safety..? - Sir. No harm will come to Sanjana. I promise you, sir. - Thank you, Major. "Like the winds sigh.." "and the birds fly.."

No kid thinks about these things, Raghavan It's time to send another message to General Bakshi Shoot that boy Shoot him while Sanjana is around And I want a recording of this! Any problems, Khan? But he's a kid This is war, Khan. Any war needs sacrifices Our war was for the country ten years back and still is Remember? Good morning, sir. We found some villagers at the border.. who claim they got lost searching for water. They are Pakistanis You know very well that you are standing on Indian soil So get ready for a trial! Are you Pakistani? Don't be afraid. Answer calmly Are you Pakistani? Yes, sir Trial over Major Datta, on what basis did you kill those eleven Pakistanis? They were Pakistani spies! - All of them? Perhaps. - Is it possible that.. ..some of them weren't spies? - It's possible. And it's also possible that none Of them were spies. They were Pakistanis! Major Datta, let me inform you.. ..we're not in a state of war with Pakistan. Brigadier Sharma, we've been in a state of war with Pakistan since 1947. I feel ashamed of having ever called you a friend. This man is mentally ill. He does not deserve to be an officer in Indian army. Ten years! It's taken me ten years to create my own army I've handpicked each soldier.. ..who can help me fight this war. I never said it would be easy.. Never claimed victory would come without losing something If blood must be shed, then it must, Khan! It could be ours, the enemies' or a little boy's. Right, Khan? - Right, sir.

Guys, please stick together! This place is new to me.. I may get lost. Come on, Ram.. "I'll get lost" What crap! He thinks it's a fair. Why'd you push? - Sorry! Hurry up, guys! Hold this. How long are they taking, man? No mistakes, Khan. I want Gen. Bakshi to know that.. ..the bullet could be for his daughter too Right, sir. Record it. The girl should be in the frame. What did I do? Oh no! In a hurry, my friend? Hurry up, Habib. C'mon, fast. Drive, Habib. Fast! Looks like your friends abandoned you. What's to become of you now? Stop! What is he doing here? He's a student, sir. Since? - About ten days old here Really? Major Ram has been protecting her for the past ten days, and you.. God! Because of your stupidity, Khan has been caught Commander, give me a chance No Captain. You don't know Major Ram Sharma! He's the best. Gen Bakshi has sent his bloody best. My departed friend Shekhar's son. Looks I'll have to.. ..deal with him myself It's going to be fun. Gentlemen.. I promise you victory, and that we will celebrate it with Khan. I promise. Enough! Leave him! Who is Raghavan? Who is Raghavan? Our commander. - A terrorist! A soldier who can die for his country! No! He can only kill. What war is he going to win by killing a young boy? And what war are you fighting by garlanding the enemies? We don't want war, we want friendship! Take him away. It's shameful that you have sold yourself to friendship.. ..and we have to do your job. You may be in the army but we are the true soldiers You and your army is useless! You are fortunate, Khan, that you're in front of an officer of the Army If we were like you, then you'd have been dead by now We have orders to take him to the headquarters Put it on hold! Keep interrogating him Though, I doubt if he'll talk Is my jeep ready? - Sir, where are you going? To college. To complete my studies If the atomic weight of Oxygen is sixteen.. ..can anyone tell me the atomic weight of Calcium? Anybody?! You?! Please.. No one in the class? Alright, I'll tell you. The atomic weight.. - Oh please let them be Your hair look beautiful when you let them fly. Really! When your hair falls on your face it's like.. 'I saw a girl and felt..' '..like a blooming rose..' "Now that you're here, and so am I.." "come a little closer so I could try.." "to tell you how madly I love you" "When I first saw you and began to get to know you.." "When I first saw you and began to get to know you.." "I lost my sense of time" "The fragrance of your body cast a spell on me" "And I lost my heart." "When I thought about you and saw you.." "When I first saw you and began to get to know you.." "I lost my sense of time" "Why are you this beautiful?" "It makes us all wonder and believe in things like fairies" "Though your beauty pales them to a blur" "So, why are you beautiful?" "That makes one speechless. I'm lost and in a mess.." "I'm obsessed" "I worshipped you,I desired only you" "When I first saw you, and began to get to know you.." "I lost my sense of time" "Now that you're here and so am I.." "come a little closer so I could tell you.." "what magic came over me when I first met your eye" "My first thoughts of you, when I realized you.." "when I really saw you, and began to know you.." "I lost my sense of time" "The fragrance of your body cast a spell on me" "And my heart slipped" "when I really saw you, and began to know you.." "when I really saw you, and began to know you.." "when I really saw you, and began to know you.." "when I really saw you, and began to know you.." Violins are playing. In college Ram? With a teacher?

My father used to say "It's a man's life" Medals on the chest, discipline, guns, tanks.. giving up life for the country.. They are so distinguished Aren't they? Mom, I'm going out Mom.. Mom why do you do this to yourself. Sorry pal, I hate the army I'm not interested in their style or their uniform They and their problems can go take a hike Lakshman! - Mom, you know I hate their display What is all this `uniform, patriotic duty..' all bullshit! Speak with some respect Lakshman! My father is in the army. I know how much he has sacrificed We never met for months because he was protecting the border.. so you, me and people like us could sleep peacefully You know what.. Even my father's in the army and he's sacrificed a lot He's even given up his family I haven't seen him for twenty years.. not because he was serving the country.. but because he left my mother and me to bring up his bastard son Lakshman, not in front of.. - I'm just speaking facts, mom It won't affect him one bit You know what.. My mother hasn't slept peacefully for twenty years It doesn't matter to him. It hardly matters to army men They have no feelings. They are inhuman you know. You don't believe me! Dad, do you hear me? I'm talking to you Lakshman, please Lakshman! - No, don't worry mom. It won't affect him He can't hear me Can you hear me, dad? He never hears me Nothing matters to him, mom Dad, I'm talking to you You don't care, right? When I fail, you don't care When I don't come back home in the night.. you don't worry about me, right? Why don't you scold me when I don't cut my hair? Scold me, please Why don't I fear you when I secretly smoke, dad.. Why? Do you care? You love me? Do you hate me? Anything.. anything I hate you I hate you, dad And I hate that swine I hate him, Mom and I hate his bastard son! Are you okay? Can you both not forgive him? It's too late, Ram It's too late for him What are you watching, Lucky? The most lucky guy in college Lucky really misses his father a lot, right? Yes. He is helpless, but you.. Life passes by and we get used to living without love Why don't we give love a chance? Why don't we trust our feelings? Why don't you speak to your father, Sanjana? Give him a call No, he always preferred to keep me away from him So now you're having your revenge? Sanjana, people change, love changes them You fear that he hates you. Perhaps he fears the same thing Why do we fear the ones we love so much? Speak to him once, Sanjana. Life's too short for hatred How are you, darling? It's me I heard your husband is out of town Where are you calling from? - From a booth opposite your home What say? Looks like someone wants to die. Just a minute. Gun, pistol.. who are you?

Had come all the way here to find him Lucky me You have 6 hours Find out the relationship between Major Ram And Lakshman Prasad So, when do you plan to tell your mother? Even Sanjana has agreed to protection You must reveal your identity.. - I know, Chandni But I'm apprehensive So Lucky Sharma is Shekhar Sharma's son Ram's step-brother. Sweet Look Ram, if they find out from elsewhere.. then they are bound to feel that you deliberately deceived them And once they know who you are I'm sure they'll love you even more I see. So once you found out, you loved me even more, eh? Any doubts? Gentlemen, get ready for action! Tomorrow Major Ram will leave for a long exile Keep watching dad, this time mom will accept me Lakshman will, too Hello Ma Lucky.. Mother.. I want to say something.. to both of you actually Ram.. Ram, you're Shekhar Sharma's son? And you never even mentioned it to me? The army officers told me He's quite a wretch, but a very dear friend We were in the same college. Can you give me his address? Or a contact number? Is everything okay, son? Looks like I've come at the wrong time Goodbye Mother I.. I was just going to tell you this.. Just don't say anything! Not a word! Shut up Mother, I hope you understand why I behaved like this One more word Ram and.. - No Lakshman. Let him speak I do want to know why he behaved like this Tell me, why did you sneak into our lives? Did you think we'd accept you, and forget everything? Will I forget the twenty years I spent like a widow? Twenty years, which will never return Did you think that if you escort me to the temple once.. and touch my feet, everything will be set right? No, Ma Wounds twenty years deep do not get filled in twenty days, Ram Go, tell your father that we don't need him anymore.. we're used to living without him And this is his penance too, to live without us.. and die without seeing our faces Pack up and leave There's no place in my home for you even today. Go! God damn it! Just a minute, Ram. What were you hoping to achieve? Why did you do all this? Why? I had come here to fulfill my father's last wish You were right. His penance was to live without seeing the two of you And.. he died without seeing the two of you He loved you a lot Lucky, he gave me his ashes I just wanted to untie the family. That's all Even though I knew I would never be accepted I'm sorry "Bonds that break.." "loved ones ache" "I hope the miles finds a bridge" "Why does this happen?" "Why does the heart bleed?" "Why am I tongue-tied?" "I leave my dearest here and how.." "I leave my dearest here and how.." I walk alone, I'm here now" "It's me who found love, yet lost it" "Here I am.. restless and unsettled" Sir Yes, sir. What? Sanju, look up. Say hello to your dad So what now, General Bakshi? Sanjana's with me now Are you still ready to sacrifice her.. and him.. and him.. and all the others? I don't think so, Gen.Bakshi. Project Milaap (Unity) is finished! I have a few more demands My soldier Khan's release, a helicopter.. and my favorite student Major Ram His education is still incomplete. Go and relive caption Mahesh. Check the corridors again. - Sir. Breaking news this evening! The Pakistan General has announced that on 15th August.. they will reciprocate by returning Indian POW's to India as well Yes sir. If one extends such a warm hand of friendship.. even Pakistan isn't so cold as to not reciprocate It's a pity that we didn't take the first step We've won. Now he'll have to release those kids Nothing has changed, General. Pakistan can do what they want You will not release the enemy And by the way, I hope Khan is near the helicopter.. and Ram has been tied up Because Sanjana and her friends have very little time left But sir, didn't we say that if Pakistan releases our prisoners.. An old habit of theirs. One hand tries to put balm on the wound.. and the other hand hides a dagger for the attack Now you guys, get back to your stations. We're expecting guests Call the Prime minister's office, and tell him that.. Project Milaap has been indefinitely postponed Inform the Pakistani Ambassador as well No, sir Sir, please don't do this. - No Ram There's a mother out there who waits for her son Tomorrow there will be several mothers sitting outside What will I possibly tell them? That for fifty Pakistani prisoners.. I had to sacrifice their children? Not fifty Pakistanis, sir. It was you who used to say that.. it's not about ten Indians or Pakistanis but thousands of soldiers It's about the common people in these countries. It's about us It's a question of an enmity which neither of us chose voluntarily I know, Ram. I understand this very well But maybe we need to wait for that friendship a bit longer Sorry sir, but how long? Today, after eons, Pakistan has extended a friendly hand towards us If we retract now, it would mean another fifty years of enmity And this time sir, we would have chosen it What happens to those children, Ram? - Don't worry about the kids, sir I promise you. Tomorrow, before dawn, all the kids will be free Please cancel your order, sir. Prepare for Project Milaap Didn't you ask if Pakistan was ready to release our prisoners too, Khan? You believed that Pakistan would laugh at us.. but Pakistan is reciprocating. Like us, Pakistan also wants peace Yes, Pakistan is releasing our prisoners Now what can Raghavan achieve by killing those innocent children? Whatever he's doing, it's for the country, Major Ram No, Khan. Major Raghavan Datta, ex-army, court-martialled.. is doing nothing for the country. Nothing Did you know that he had son who was killed in Kashmir.. by terrorists such as you But Raghavan believes that Pakistanis killed him Raghavan is doing nothing for this country He is just carrying out a misplaced vendetta It's just revenge, Khan. - Impossible, Major Ram. You're lying Raghavan had said.. - Raghavan lied to you, Khan Didn't you say your war is for the country? Well, tomorrow the gun will be in your hand Choose. Will you fight for you country or for Raghavan? You lost your home, your husband because of me once I won't let you lose your son I assure you, Lakshman will not be harmed I'm here now Ram.. I want both my sons back Khan.. Are you okay? - I'm fine, sir Major! Major, I thought you are the very best I was right in front of you and you couldn't even recognize me Let the children go, Raghavan You've got what you wanted and Pakistan is also cooperating with us Yeah, yeah. I heard It is this naivety that will sink us eventually No Raghavan. People like you will sink us You only know to hate, shed blood You are so used to violence that you can't bear the idea of peace But there will be peace, there will be understanding And there will be friendship - No friendship with Pakistan, Ram! Only war. And one result. Pakistan's defeat Only then can the blood on their hands.. ..wipe away all the bloodshed, our soldiers, my son.. who had nothing to do with the war. Why did the Pakistanis kill him? His body lay atop a hill in Kashmir for two days. On ice. No one ever knew Ram, there will be no friendship with Pakistan. I won't let it happen! You should think real hard before you hate Raghavan.. because one day you will become exactly that what you detest the most Shut up, Ram Now you are going to kill these innocent kids.. ..and become what you once hated the most. A filthy murderer! Silence! He has the blood of innocent people, kids, on his hands I say shut up, Ram. - Project Milaap won't stop. Project Milaap won't stop. You've lost, Raghavan Silence!
