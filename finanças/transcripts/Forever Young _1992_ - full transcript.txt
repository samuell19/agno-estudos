Coming through angels 19! Take it easy, viper one. Don't push it too far. Throttling back. 18-5. Rpm 2,500. Airspeed--airspeed needle stuck... But we're still in the green. 17-5. Aw, heck. 15-5. Vsi pegged. Negative buffet. Sir, sir, I know what you're going to say, but remember what happened with the b-39. danny here? [Danny] It's sticking! We're pretty much in a dive up here. It's 12-5... And she's purring, all right. Bring it back, viper one. roger! Oh! Serious fluttering! It's hard. Controls are resisting. I have full nose-up trim. Slip it in, viper one. Come on, slip it in!

What, danny? See what? Captain! Oh. Mccormick--three cs. You figure it out. harry, the damnedest thing happened up there. Any dizziness? Huh? What? No. Excuse me, i'm still having a heart attack. It looked good, didn't it? Queasiness? No queasiness. I thought you weren't surfacing until you finished your thing. Blackout? No blackouts. Don't work for the airline. I bet you thought i wouldn't pull up. The thought crossed my mind. Mine, too. Blindness? Headache? Chest pain? No. I was close enough to see your license plate, and all of a sudden i saw helen. You had a vision? Huh? Agh! Did you vomit? tyler, no. There was no vomit. i'm talking now. Later, huh? Anything you say, captain. Nice soft landing. I thought, "she's coming home tonight. I better pull up." Wham! I hit the ground. Boy, am I hungry. I could go for some ribs. danny, i'm here because it worked. It worked? A little rough around the edges, but it worked. What? harry. That's incredible, harry! Shh! Listen, listen! No one can know, o.K.? Of course. No one can know. Uh, helen can know, right? All right, but nobody else. It really is sort of incredible. harry. That's incredible. Where is he? Back at the lab. harry! Oh! i'll get cleaned up. We'll celebrate! Oh, my god. Ha ha! harry! Hey, i'm driving! Ha ha ha. Sure, o.K. Yeah... Better be o.K.

Well, harry and i got a little drunk. Oh, yeah? Yeah. A celebration? Well, kind of. You're hungry. I know. So... What were you celebrating? Wait, let me guess. harry's 400th consecutive hour in the laboratory, right? Close, but no cigar. How is it? danny, i've been eating dust for four days. So... What were you celebrating? The key question here is, why wasn't I invited? Well, we would've if you were here. harry froze a chicken. Big deal. My butcher's done that. Yeah? Well... i'll bet your butcher's never brought the chicken back to life again. He what? I swear! I saw the chicken. It was walking around! harry's a genius, which he was proclaiming himself after the second bottle of champagne. So, what, this is some big government chicken conspiracy? What? Don't take this lightly. You can't tell anybody, all right? Just my mother. Oh, helen, no. Y-you can't. [Laughing] i'm sorry. I was kidding. Promise me you won't tell. I promise. I promise.

Next year blanche will be celebrating her first mother's day. [Applause] [Man] Fabulous, harry! Congratulations, blanche. Thank you, daniel. Congratulations, blanche. I would've told you earlier, but we just found out for sure. [Man] Hey, uh, a toast! To harry, junior. [Woman] To harriet! Look, it's 1939 already, and we... Gosh, you usually get my thoughts before I do, so you probably know what i'm going to say. helen... Will you marry me? Uh...No. You know, helen, i been thinking-- danny, guess what. What? collier's wants the pictures for november. No kidding? Oh, that's great. But they say it's kind of a rush thing. They need the pictures bu thursday, which means I have to have them ready tomorrow afternoon, which means I have to get to work. I have to go. Wait. What? Want some pie? We just had pie. Not the blueberry. How could you still be hungry? Isn't that the darnedest thing? I just--frank? Some blueberry pie. Sure you don't want some? Yeah. Just one, thanks. What's going on? What's going on? Mm-hmm. Nothing. I just want you to sit with me while I eat, that's all. I-i'll eat fast. You're trying to break some bad news to me. You're going to test some crazy rocket? Where do you cook this stuff up? No, there's no crazy rocket. Ooh! Oh, thank you. Uh... I have to go. O.K. I know. Call me later, all right? O.K. Bye. [Thunder] Oh! Are you sure you've got to go? danny... Are you sure you're o.K.? What? What is it? helen... Let's never leave this phone booth. You're acting nuts. I am? Mm-hmm. More than usual. i'll see you later. Yeah, what are you still doing here? Get out of here. Hey, harry? Yeah. harry... I almost did it. Yeah, I just-- I couldn't get the words past my throat. Well, you inspired me. I mean--tell me something, harry. When you asked blanche, how did you-- but-- yeah, really? On her head? And she still said yes? danny. Yeah, just a sec, frank. You got to go outside. [Siren] [Thunder and rain] [Knock on door] [Knock knock] danny? [Pounding on door] dan! [Doorknob rattles] Come on, danny. [Knocking] God damn it, danny, will you open the door? [Pounding] Please? [Pounding] Hi, harry. After the first two weeks, they said she wouldn't wake up. That was nearly six months ago. Doctors can be wrong. I talked to dr. morrison... And kelvin and hastings and collins. They all say the same thing. She said, "i'll see you later." That was the last thing she said-- "i'll see you later." They're moving her to a chronic care facility in... santa rosa. It's a better place, i think. The doctors all agree there's nothing that can be done. We used to play out by the lighthouse when we were kids... And she'd say we'd grow old together... In that great house just down the road. harry, I don't have one single memory without her. Nothing was real until she knew. Did you hear charlie was canned from my project? No. They found two bottles of gin in his locker. He tried to deny it, but he was so sozzled, he fell on his ass and passed out. Six days before the test, and he's out. His timing was always beautiful like that. What test? What test? My project. My secret project. I was going to freeze a human being. Well, if you call charlie a human being. How long? A year. See, the beautiful thing about charlie is the guy had no life. What better way to iron out the kinks, right? [Thunder] [Danny] harry, I can't watch her die. I want to sleep for a year. Look, you've been through an awful lot. i've thought this through. Forget it. i've been in the service for 12 years. i'm military. i'm healthy. i've got no family, nowhere to go. I know tests. I know experiments. It's my job! i'm perfect. You know that. dan, I don't even know if this thing will work for a year. harry, let me do it. Please. I can't think anymore. I can't. Until she-- until it's over. You've said yourself that doctors can be wrong. That's true, you know. If she gets better, wake me up. [Harry] Bring the internal to 20. 21. 20. [Scientist] We're stay for phase three. Sealing second barrier. Cancel pulse. Reading negative. Barometer is 7...16. 8 to 16. [Harry] Keep 20. Do we have that? Copy. Phase four power descent. We have 20. Reduce pressure. How's the heart rate? Heart rate... Looking good. [Scientist] Hit the valve. Needle at 6. Needle at 6-5. We're in the black. [Harry] Record date and time, please. 26 november, 1939. 0417 hours. All right, gentlemen, this is it. This is history. [Sucking noise] Mmm. [Sucking] Hey. Got the dentist tomorrow? [Sucking] Yep. Any good? Yeah. You were good company. She said, yawning. i'm not yawning. Well, you were about to. You see? Sorry. [Yawn] Ohh! i'm sorry about dinner. I just have a tendency to burn things. No, no. It wasn't really burned. It's just, you know, well done. It was significantly, dramatically well done. Well, uh... We'll do it again. Sure. Anytime. I know the maitre d'. Uh, see you at the hospital, o.K.? Air show this weekend, right? Yeah. You can invite john if you want to. O.K. Maybe. We'll see. Good night. Whoo! [Making guitar noises] Oww! Whoo! [Continues making guitar noises] Wa-hoo! Hey, what's this? It's called parking, felix. I thought you were taking us home! Will you chill out, freak? I got to drop something off. Unlike you, i have responsibilities. Yeah, but mom said you were going to take us home-- directly. Oh, well, that's a real nice story, felix, but mom and dad are in vegas and i'm not. You move from this car, and I swear to god, one day i'll put a poisonous snake in your bed. Oh, no. [Kiss] You, too. Dickhead. We won't be able to work within that time frame. Yeah. I think we'll have to postpone construction at least another week, and that's at the least. We're sorting through a lot of stuff here. I can keep you updated. Oh, man... Check it out. Hey, hey. Race you to the end? Hurry up! We got 10 seconds! It's going to blow! Hurry! 10...9...8... 7... Aah! Oh, i'm burning up! Here, i'll-- oh! It burns! It burns! It burns! Are you all right? It burns! Ohh! Are you all right? Oh! Aah! Oh! Are you all right? Ohh... i've got my guys on it round the clock. Uh-huh. What can I do for you, airman? Give this to samuels. He's out front in the trailer. Thank you. roger. Temperature is 1-2-3. Ready. Activating the turbo-power speed booster. Get ready for some radioactive energy. Hmm. O.K., how low are we? The needle says...65. 47! O.K., ready to raise periscope? Yep. Ready to raise periscope. O.K. We have a leak. Emergency! Sir, what do I do? Tighten the oxygen! Ooga! Ooga! Ooga! Ooga! Ooga! Ooga! Oh, my god. Careful. It's cold. Yeesh. Aah! Look at him. He's cold, too. Do you think he's dead? Aah! Aah! Help me! Get me out of this thing! Help! Help! Aah! Aah! steven, we went inside there! There was this big metal thing! There's a dead guy inside! Just shut up! steven, I swear! He was really cold. He grabbed my jacket and took it! If I was cold, i'd take your jacket also. No, but he didn't-- shut up! You're pathetic, both of you! Look, I am the boss in this car! Me! I am! And the boss says... Shut up! Are you sure this isn't the finest excuse you've ever come up with for losing a jacket? It'd be a great excuse, but no, mom, it's the truth. This frozen guy was there! I was there, and I saw him, too! i'm sure he's in there for a reason. Finish your peas. [Grunting] [Grunting] I... Would like... R-r-r-richmond 3-4-2, please. [Operator] Excuse me? richmond 3-4-2. 7-4-3-4-2? Yes! Please. i'd like... To speak to... harry f-finley. harry-- harry finley, please. Sir, you're missing two digits. You need seven digits, sir. You only gave me five. You need seven. Wha-- [dial tone] [Helicopter approaches] Oh, brother. [Counting cadence] Sir, i'm sorry. There's no one stationed here by that name. Aw, heck. Well, then I need to talk to someone else in charge. i'm sorry, but there's no way I can let you in here. I know how I must look to you, o.K.? And believe me, I wouldn't let me in here, either. Sir? i'm sorry, but i'm going to have to ask you to leave. My name is captain daniel mccormick. Serial number 241988539. I know your name, too. Now, you sure look like a nice kid. But if you don't get your supervisor out here now, I will personally make sure that you pull guard duty for the rest of your military career! Have you got that? And you say it was registered as project b, which stands for buford? Yes, sir. That was the name of the... Chicken. That harry finley first tested? That's correct. And you say you woke up last night in the warehouse that we're tearing down. I know that it sounds crazy, but, uh-- just a little. Who was your supervising officer? Boyle. Major david e. Boyle. Boyle. I went to the place where harry used to live. Now there's a place called ralph's there. I see. Well, we don't keep records that far back on base. But there is a team of scientists that would be fascinated to hear what you have to say. This is all highly classified information? That's right. harry didn't tell anybody about this. Not even the people that worked for him knew. Just harry and I, and I told one other person, but... Who's that? She's dead. Uh-huh. i'm going to call security. That'd be swell. Can I have a cigarette? Oh, yeah. Sure. sam? Yeah. Me. i've got something here I think you should do something about. Yeah. Yeah, so I think you should probably meet. He says he was in a metal capsule in our warehouse for a number of years. You might want to come over with some men. Because I think, you know, it's really going to be a... It's going to be a... sam, hold on one sec, sam. You can cancel it, sam. i'm not lying. You're lying. He said he'd never seen so many cavities in one mouth at the same time. He wanted to send a sample of my saliva to the university of wisconsin. Your saliva. Yeah. [Doorbell rings] Here. Give it to me. Yes? Are you nat cooper? It's the dead guy! The dead guy! Aah! The dead guy! Go! Go! Help me! Help! Help! Help! Help! Hey, i'm not going to-- ouch! Help me! Somebody, help me! i'm not going to kill you, o.K.? i'm not going to kill you, o.K.? O.K. O.K. Jeez. I just want to know how I got this jacket. [Both talking at once] All right. All right. All right! Just you. We went to the warehouse with felix' brother steven. And we were playing in there even though we weren't supposed to. And we saw that big metal thing. We thought it was a submarine. We opened it up somehow, and you were inside. That's all, right? Right. There were no guards there? No doctors? No one? No, sir. Just a bunch of junk. Junk? Hello, ma'am. I was looking for a gentleman named harry finley. He used to live around this area. And, uh, I thought you might be related to him. No? Thanks anyway, ma'am. Yes. Thanks. Goodbye. So, you fellas do this a lot, mess with classified military experiments? No, sir. This is the first time. My name's nat. This is felix. Hi. What's yours? daniel. You want me to steal you some clothes from my dad? Hello, sir. Ex-excuse me, sir. This fella just asked me to leave a message, then squealed in my ear. Hi, this is nat. i'm looking for a guy named harry finley. If you know how to find him, call me at 555-2368. Thank you. It was just an answering machine. Machine? i'm talking to a machine. What the heck happened to the last 50 years? I use this for my history. I got a b-minus. You can go really fast, like this. Slow. Zoom in, like that. Oh, hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Oh, my god. daniel, what do you do, anyway, like, for a job? daniel? Huh? What do you do for a job? Uh, test pilot. felix, oh, my god! He's a pilot.

Well, i'm just here doing some reading. Little women. It's good. Hey. I got into a huge bike accident. Really? Thrashed my bike. Thrashed. Totally thrashed. Look. I got a big cut, too. Yep. It's going to be a big scab. But I won't pick at it. Well, that's cool. Heh. Thanks. Well, I got to go. O.K. See ya. O.K. Cool. i'm a geek. You'll want to write to the national personnel records center. They deal with all military records. They got a form. It takes, like, six weeks. Six weeks is too long, miss. This is urgent.

Yeah, i guess it would. Um, all right. I have a friend. He works at a locator service in san antonio. Let me see what he can do. It might take a couple days. They get pretty busy. It's o.K. If you call me here tomorrow after 12:00, that's when I get in. And if susan answers, ask for me--debbie. I put my home number on there, too, just in case. You can stay here more than one night.

Oh, dear... Uh...This yours? No. It must have been his. i'm sure he'd want you to have it. Oh, look, you're bleeding. That's nothing. That's just blood. No, no. Let me clean it up. That's just a scratch. No, it's a gash. i'm a nurse. I know a gash when I see one. Sit down. [Car engine starts] [Tires squeal] You may have just saved my life. Oh, no. Well, maybe. That prick! i've known assholes in my time, but this guy-- this guy could give lessons. This is going to sting. You see, fred is a drunk. Which, by the way, is the least of his problems. He's got no spine and no decency. He's a punk. And I knew it the day I met him. I know what you're thinking. I haven't gone out with him in...Two years. Over that. Every once in a while he comes back like those storms over in japan. You know, those violent ones that destroy the villages? Well, that's fred. Did you tell me your name? daniel. daniel. I knew a danny once. Worse than fred. Well, maybe not. Ooh. So, daniel, what do you do... Besides patrol neighborhoods looking for signs of domestic problems? i'm an air corps test pilot. Oh. And in your off-time you go around saving lives? That's it. Well... My name's claire. In case you were curious. "A scout never shirks or grumbles at hardship." What the hell is "shirks"? For one thing, they're both mammals. Hey, guys. Hey, mom. i'd like you to meet someone. This is my son nat and his friend felix. This is daniel. Hi, fellas. Hello. You guys o.K.? Yeah. daniel's a pilot. Wow. Cool. You're kidding. Hey, I see you found your jacket. Still think you saw a frozen guy? No. [Telephone rings] Excuse me. [Ring] What are you doing here? Some jerk showed up. I got rid of him. Don't worry, i'm leaving. Wait. The couch is totally comfy. Or you could have my room. I got a glow-in-the-dark universe. Your mother's not going to let a stranger stay in the house. Want to bet? The toothpaste is in the mirror. I think there's a new toothbrush there, too. The towels are under the sink. Nat, get him a pillow, please. If you want hot water, turn the faucet to 4:00. When it gets warm, turn it to 9, then back to 11. It's sort of like a safe. It's awfully kind to let me stay here. I figured if you wanted to kill me, you would've let fred do it. Besides, you've got an honest smile. Some people were born with great legs. The rest of us have to work at it. I did aerobics till I dropped. Then I found thighmaster. Great legs. Thank you. Every time you squeeze thighmaster, you strengthen and tone right where you need it. So it's easy to squeeze, squeeze your way to shapely hips and thighs. When these muscle groups get out of shape, the result is flabby thighs. It's called television. Yeah, I know. I saw it at the world's fair in '39. That's why I recommend it and use it myself. My problem with exercise is finding time to do it. Night. Night. Thanks, thighmaster. daniel? daniel, get up. That guy called back. He knows a harry finley. Lives about an hour from here. I got to go. What time is it? It's 7:30. Wait. Before you go, we're going to the wings of freedom. The air show-- it's near where your friend lives. Morning. Morning, mom. Well, how was it? claire, you're one of the kindest people i've met. You haven't seen my temper. Yeah. You haven't seen that. Hey. How about breakfast? I got to meet an old friend. I got to run. You sure? i'm a hell of a defroster. No. i'm late as it is. daniel, come to the air show. It's so cool. Nat, he said he had to go. Well, goodbye. And thank you. Thanks again. And good luck. You, too. Bye. Well, I guess that's that. Thanks a lot. Thanks again. Yes? May I help you? harry? Yes. May I help you? Yes. i'm sorry, sir. Uh, you're not the... Are you o.K.? Sir? You got a ticket? You got to buy a ticket over there. $12. Is it o.K. To look inside? Sure, go right ahead. Hi, debbie. This is, uh, daniel from yesterday. Yeah. Well, I was hoping maybe you heard something. Well, couldn't you rush it? Uh, it's just that i-- yeah. Sure. Yeah. Well, i'll--sure, i'll try again later. [Crying] Hey. Quit following me, o.K.? Hi, claire. You find anybody to rescue? You know, i've been told... That I listen exceptionally well... If you wanted to tell me anything. You ever feel lost? I invented it. It's mine. My buddy was supposed to be here when I woke up. He used to live around here, and I can't find him. I know that sounds desperate, but he really is all I have left. You could always go home, right? I lost someone close to me. That's why I left. That's why I haven't got any money or clothes or a place to stay. I just left and... And where i'd end up was the last thing on my mind. Everything o.K.? john. Uh, yeah. i'm sorry. daniel, this is john, and john, this is daniel. Hi, john. Pleased to meet you. daniel is going to be staying with us for a couple of days. Till he finds his friend. Well...It's good to know you, daniel, good to know you. Hi, this is debbie... Hi, debbie, this is daniel mccormick. Leave a message. i'll call back. Hi, debbie, this is daniel mccormick. i'm staying at 555-2368. Um, i'd really appreciate it, if you hear anything, if you could call me here. Thanks again for everything. Uh, bye. Oh! Making dinner? Yeah. I got to do something. Yeah. Hey, listen, I thought maybe tomorrow, if you don't find your friend, that maybe you could teach me to fly. That might be tough. How come? Well, to begin with... I don't have a flight jacket. And secondly... I don't have a plane. My father left when I was 1. Thought you might want to know that. Well, I really don't think that's any of my business. He left when I was 1. He hasn't talked to us since. Thanks. Can I help out? Yeah. Chop up this onion. Just the onion, not the fingers, o.K.? I know. O.K. Don't worry. Boy. Heh heh. Anyway, this guy is covered in blood. Covered, right? His heart has stopped. They have to open him up right there, no time for procedure. So they open him up. I had to massage his heart. I actually held his heart and pumped it for him. There was this horrible accident on the 5. There were other injuries. Anyway, this guy whose heart i'm pumping, his eyes open. He looks at me, and he looks at his heart and says, "you're holding my heart." What did you say? "Yes, I am." The anesthesiologist almost passed out. Anyway, that was... Couple of weeks ago. Today, when I got into work, he sent me a box of chocolates shaped like a heart. Isn't that a good story? Great. No, this is great. [Doorbell rings] The scary thing is... That all of this was in my cupboard, lurking. Thank you very much for taking the boys to that. That was way above... We have a date... Tonight. Am I early? No. I was just trying out daniel's cooking. It's good. It's not bad. Want some? No. Um, i'll just be a sec. Guys. Hey. So, you're a doctor? Yeah. Yeah. That's right. I understand you're a pilot? Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Doctor, pilot. Yeah. Shit! Mom? claire, are you all right? Yeah... i've just got a waterfall in my closet. Get the spaghetti pot. Whoa! Aw, heck, that's a leak. It's just a hole in the roof. Just? We could do this another night. No, john. Have you got hammers, nails, shingles? Is there anything i can do? Oh, wait. I can go to the hardware store tomorrow, get some things, fix this in a jiffy. Go to dinner, you two. Get out of here. Uh, o.K. Wait, um... The roof will be on fred. fred? fred. 9:00. i'm starving. Have fun. Yes, sir. I understand, sir. I did. Yeah. It was just a bad judgment call. The media circus here... I understand, sir. i'm sure it will not come to that. No. I am right on top of it, sir. You'd better be.

Yeah. Yeah? She's really cool. Plus she's really pretty. So what was your question? Well, felix says i should make her jealous. Says that's what his brother does with girls. Don't you think you're a little young to be... You ought to be thinking about other stuff. i'm 10. I really like her. If I were you, um... i'd put her out of my mind. Just forget about her. Trust me. Ohh! Ooh! Uhh! daniel! daniel... You o.K.? Yeah, yeah. Hey. Hey. Thanks for risking your life to save my underwear. I just lost my balance up there today. You sure you don't want to talk to john?

Well, you know how you wanted to know what you should do. Nat, you got to tell her. What? The very next time you see her, when your heart starts pounding and you're all nervous, and--you know what I mean. Yeah. Just let go. What do you mean, let go? Tell her everything. Tell her how you feel. It's hard, but you got to do it. Let go. How? How? You know that stuff that you told me? Tell that stuff to her. Open up your heart. Sing to her. Sing? Yeah. Tell her everything. Sing to her. The sooner the better. 'Cause, you know, you might never get another chance. Do you follow? Uh-huh. Good. Good. It's late. Good. Go to sleep. I just...

Um... No, sir. No, sir, this is very serious. Look, i'm sorry to disturb you, but my name's nat cooper. i'm in love with your daughter. I see her in class. I like her a lot. And that's the truth. Nat? Mm-hmm? Go home. But, sir... Good night. [Beep] [Beep] [Telephone rings] [Ring] Hello. Ahem. Yeah, this is cameron. They found what? You're leaving? Yeah. I got this for you. Falcon control... Magnetos on. Right. Prime the engines. Do it for a couple seconds. You want to make sure fuel gets to the engines. And set your brakes. Right. Don't say "right." Say "check." Right gets confusing. Check. Check. Right. All right? Starter engine on. O.K., the oil pressure's coming up. Mixture's still rich. Give it a little throttle. Just a little. We're rolling. Check your flight controls. Make sure they're free and correct. Good. O.K., now, set your flaps for takeoff. Not too much. Just 1/4. You ready? Throttle full on. All the way. O.K., now we're going. We're moving. Back pressure. More back pressure. Increasing? Yep. O.K., we're climbing. We're up. O.K. Lift gear. Gear up. O.K., gear up. Flaps up. Flaps up. O.K., we're flying. Come back to middle. All right. Hey, where's the airport? Um, it's over there. O.K., let's go back there. Smooth, now. Smooth. We lost an engine. Right engine's out. Feather the props and cut the mixture. We got to find a place to land. Do you see anyplace? There. A field. O.K. Looks o.K. To me. Stay calm. Maintain optimum glide speed. Slowly pull your power back and get in a notch of these flaps. Just a notch. O.K. Will we make it? Yeah. Put your gear down. Gear down. Mixture rich. Airspeed-- 135 miles per hour. Full flaps. Watch the horizon, nat. Pull back. Not too much. You'll flare up. Go easy. Just watch the horizon. Watch the horizon. Go steady. O.K.! O.K., watch out-- watch out for the tree. Whoa! And the cows. And the potholes. O.K., now step on the brakes. Slowly. Too much. Slowly. Whoo! Whoa. If you can land a b-25, you can do anything. Thanks a lot. No, thank you... For the jacket. You're welcome. Doesn't this tree house get your back? Hey, daniel, are you sure you don't want to stay? daniel? daniel! Aah! What's happening? What's happening? Huh? What's happening? Aah! Help! Help! Help! Help! Blood pressure? 90 over 60. Pulse is 112 and thready. What you got, matt? Oh, god. Mom... i'm not making this up. Mom? Put mccormick in emergency. Mccormick? It's the fbi. This guy's in trouble. Look at those indices. Exactly what kind of blood activity is that? dr. cameron, lieutenant colonel wilcox. How you doing? You feeling o.K., sir? Yeah, i'm just not the best flier. I hear you have some, uh, some good news. Yes, sir, some very good news. Hey. Quit following me. Oh, brother. i'm still here, huh? You... Look... Terrible. Yeah, but not bad for a guy my age, right? It's not possible. claire, I was born in 1907. I know. daniel, please. I felt the same when harry first told me the idea. harry finley? Some woman called yesterday, left a message on the machine, but I thought it was a wrong number. It's still on the machine. Maybe he was exposed to some form of radiation. He's got what looks like a mutated form of progeria. i've never seen anything like this. claire, he's aging. Is he going to live? I don't know. We have to get him out of here. The fbi's coming. Something's going on. I know. Stall them. What? Please? john, trust me. All right. Ahem. Yeah. Jump in. O.K. Thanks. Nat. Who are those guys? fbi. I think I can walk. Just shut up and look sick. Oh, i'm dr. holby. There's something you should know. What is it, doctor? Mccormick has been moved. Nat, open the door. Yes, reception should have told you. i'm sorry. He's now in the east wing. Make your first right. East wing, icu. Room 144. i'm o.K., claire. i'm all right. Sure? Yeah. Excuse me. What the hell is going on here? Yes? Hello, ma'am. i'm looking for a man named harry finley. He was a scientist. His wife's name was blanche. Uh, he was from chicago. Do you know this man? That's my father. Is he home? i'm--i'm sorry, but my father is dead. He lived here once for a couple of months, but he died before I was born. You must be looking for another man. I was his best friend. daniel? susan finley's address is 14 cyprus pond road. Blue file says her father first found the problem two months after mccormick volunteered. finley died in a chemical fire trying to save his friend. Operations claimed mccormick was killed as well. They dropped the file. There was no investigation. The project slipped through the cracks during the war. So what you're telling me is that he was lost. Mccormick was misplaced for 50 years. That seems to be the case. Inventory says the capsule was a water heater, sir. My god. Oh. Here they are. That's them, all right. "august... "september, october, november... '39." "Irreversible." daniel... Here. These might help. daniel. Hmm? I think we should go back to the hospital. i'm sure there's something they can do. That's her, isn't it? helen. Is that your child? No. We were never married. That's me in the picture. I was 2. That's impossible. She died before you were born. daniel... helen's alive. That's where we grew up. I know. When did she move back? About seven years ago, after her husband died. She was married? daniel, come on! I can't thank you enough. Goodbye. Mom, maybe you should put the car in drive. claire. Whoa! Mom, are we going as fast as we can? i'm trying, nat. claire, claire. I don't think we're going to make it in this car. I need an airplane. Oh, boy. Nat, hold on. Whoa! Whoa! All right! Holy cow! You drive like me. Hold on. Just dropping off a pilot. Hey! Stay here. Nat... Goodbye. claire... Remove the wheel blocks. i'll never ask you another favor. You're holding my heart. Bye. [Horn honks] Get out of the way! Excuse me. Watch it. Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey! Hey, hey! Cut him off! Hey, stop! Look, he hasn't seen this woman in 50 years. Hasn't he been through enough? You'll get your plane back. Why can't you just leave him alone? We are not here to hurt captain mccormick. Well, what do you want him for, then? A cup of coffee? A little chat? Excuse me. Excuse me. Walk this way, please. You know how long it takes to get to the next star system? 100 years. And that's the closest one. You can't make that trip without this technology, and right now we're decades behind where finley got in 1939. And daniel-- daniel is the only link between finley's work and my own. That's not true. Everything you ever wanted to know about freezing someone. Oh, my god. [Footsteps] What the heck are you doing here? You forgot your jacket. Put your belt on. O.K. Ah... Can we at least talk to them? On the radio? We have the craft on radar. i'm going to see the capsule. Tell dr. reese to get here. I also want the serial ekg, cardiac enzymes, everything the hospital did on mccormick. What about the plane? As soon as it lands, have an escort take mrs. cooper to get her son. Thank you. Thank you. There's the old house. [Moans] [Gasps] Nat. Here. Gently. Gently! Oh! Gently. O.K. Increase back pressure. Check! Increase back pressure! Ohh! Oh! Don't die, o.K.? Turn to the right. Gear down, nat. Gear down. Gear down! O.K. We're going to land this together. O.K.! O.K.? All right! 120 miles an hour. Ohh! Full flaps. Check! Full flaps! Oh! Now, watch the horizon. Watch the horizon! Watch the-- daniel! Watch the horizon, watch the horizon! Oh, crap! Oh! Oh, god! Hold it back. Throttle back. Brakes. Brakes! Stop! Stop! Stop! Show-off. Yeah. Yeah! Yeah! You o.K.? Yeah, o.K. danny. Yeah. [Crying] So, are you going to marry me or what? Yes.
