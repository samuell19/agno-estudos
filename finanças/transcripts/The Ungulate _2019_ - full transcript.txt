(country music) - [Narrator] Through the thickets and brush, it strides. With stealth and awareness, it hides. They'll pray for the hunter who waits in his stand. And knows no better than the kingdom of its land. The hunter catches a glimpse of what not to be seen. Now the hunter takes its aim and pulls the trigger clean. Through the thickets and brush it strides with reason. And rules its kingdom for one more season. (gentle music) (creepy music) (screaming) (creepy music) - You got him, daddy. - I did. - Can I go get him? - Absolutely. Go grab him up, go. (creepy music) - Daddy, was mommy a hunter? - Your mom, a hunter? Not even close. I wasn't a hunter either. See, we ran a nursery down in Milton all the way up till her death. - I wish I would've known her. - Well, you were three at the time, so, but I will tell you this. She was a great wife and an even better mom. Aha, hey, guess what time it is? - Daddy! - You guessed it, study time. Get your books. What you choose? - Social studies. - I would've chose that too. (ominous music) - [Jim] Thank God we're here, geez. - [Allen] No shit, Jim. Fucking homies been dead near an hour and slept 11 miles. Shit, I have got to shit. - [Jim] Well go. - [Allen] Fuck man. (grunting) God damn it. - [Jim] You been paying attention to the weather, man? - [Allen] Yeah. - [Jim] Looking a little gloomy. - [Allen] Gonna be off and on, gonna be off and on. - Can't go wrong with that though. It makes for a good day. (ominous music) - Come on, time to go. Wake up Allen. - All right, all right, I'm up, I'm up. - Grab your shit, let's go. - All right, all right. Where's Jim? - Let's move. Come on. - Oh shit. We ain't got time for this. I'm on the move. I'm stuck. (ominous music) - Well? - Oh hey, you know what time it is? - It's 5:30. What are you doing up so early on a Saturday? - I'm sorry, honey, I gotta take a trip today. - But it's your day off and we were supposed to go to my aunt's for her birthday tonight. - Damn it, I'm sorry, hon. - [Female] Well, where you going? - I got some phone calls from landowners up by Greyson. They're up there poaching deer. - Well, do you want some coffee? - I'm already late. I love you. - Be safe. - I will. I'll see you tomorrow. (ominous music) (gentle music) - Man, we about to bust some big ass bucks today, boys. - Amen to that brother. - Let's get something straight boys, we're out here to fill orders. Horns are a bonus but the meat and the hide are our income. So if I see either one of you pussies missing a shot on a doe today, you're gonna have hell to pay with me. Get it? - I got you, Jim. - No problem, man. - I want you to about 150 yards down there. - I got it. - [Allen] Where do you want me, Jim? - [Jim] About 100 yards up here. - [Allen] All right, no problem. (ominous music) (grunting) - You are a big boy. Thought I was gonna have empty my gun to bring you down. But like always Scotty wins the day. - [Jim] Scotty, come in. - I got me a big one, Jim. From now on one fucking cent, you got it? Ten four, you fucking asshole. (gentle music) (ominous music) - You are mine. (gunfire blasting) (ominous music) Got you, you son of a bitch. (ominous music) What the fuck? Oh fuck, no, no, no, no, no. Oh no, no, no, fuck. Damn it, fuck! Oh shit! Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Jim, Jim! Jim! (gunfire blasting) Jim, where the fuck are you? (gunfire blasting) (water dripping) (gunfire blasting) (ominous music) - Fawn? Fawn? Fawn? Fawn? God damn it. (gunfire blasting) - What do you think about this bad boy? - Drop it. - Geez, Jim, what's got you so shook? - I think Allen might be in trouble. - What the hell makes you say that? - [Jim] He fired five shots. - You know Allen. He probably tried to take down a whole herd. - Just get the hell over here, let's go. (ominous music) - Fawn! Fawn! Fawn! Fawn! Fawn! Fawn! (ominous music) - Allen, what the hell you? Allen, what the fuck did you do? - Jim, I thought she was a deer, man. I swear to God, I thought she was a deer. I'm so sorry. - We're all going to jail, Allen, you stupid son of a bitch. - Cut it out, cut it out. - What are we gonna do, Jim? - Cut it out! - Is she still breathing? Oh geez, she's dead, Jim. - Allen, you dumb fuck, you. - Jim. - Go get the shovel out of the back of the truck. - What? - Go get the fucking shovel out of the back of the truck. - What are we gonna do, bury her? - I don't know. I spent five years in the pen. I'm not spending another god damn day or night there. - Maybe we could just call the police. - Yeah and what? Tell 'em we're out here poaching for profit? That'll go over good. - My mind's fucked right now, Jim. What was girl doing out here in these woods anyway in the middle of nowhere? - I don't know! - Hey, have you seen my little girl? She had a fur coat on. She's not at home, I can't find her. What the fuck? Oh my God. No, no, no, no, no. Oh my God, no. No, no, no, no, no. - Dude, it was an accident. She came out of nowhere. Like my buddy, he thought she was a deer. Complete accident, man. - Oh no, my baby. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. What the fuck are you guys doing, you sick son of a bitches? You son of a bitch. (grunting) (gunfire blasting) - Oh my fucking God. Oh my fucking leg is open, holy shit. - Christ Jim, did you have the fucking shoot him? - You want to spend the rest of your life in jail? - No, fuck no, you're right, you're right. - Allen! Allen! Get it together. (crying) - The fuck are we gonna do, Jim? (ominous music) - Christ Jim, I thought you were gonna shoot me. What the hell have you done? - It's a honest to God accident, sheriff, honest to God. - A fucking accident. - It was an accident. - Just saw a little girl. I thought she was deer, had the little furry thing on her head, running through the woods. - What about this one? - Collateral damage, pissed off father. - What do I do? What do I say? - We'll clean it up. - You know, I should just shoot all three of you fucking idiots right now. - I said we'll clean it up. - You better. Now where's my cut from the last hunt? - Scotty, make sure you bury that with him, no evidence. - You got it. - And bury him God damn good and deep. If any animals dig him up, we're all truly fucked. - Why don't we just burn him, sheriff? - Sure and have every fire department in the goddamn county here in no time at all. You bunch of damn retards. Come on, lets go get my money, Jim. (ominous music) - Not the way I expected to spend my fucking day. You know Allen, it's fucking bullshit. First I'm cleaning deer, processing meat, tanning hides. Now I'm digging fucking holes. - How old do you think she was, Scotty? - What? - The girl, you think she was a teenager? - No Allen, I don't think she was a teenager. I think she's a fucking child. And why the hell am I digging the hole? I didn't even kill anybody. You dig the son of a bitch. Shit, ah what have you done Allen? (ominous music) - That's $3,800 you owe me. And what's with them two? - What about 'em? - Well seems they got us in a hell of a mess. And that Allen buddy of yours, he seems a little bit weak minded, real cry baby. - Don't worry about Allen. He's been with me for five years, loyal as fuck. - Well you picked him so if anything, and I mean anything gets out about this. - I'll take care of it, sheriff. - Do I need to count this? - I doubt it. - Well bury him good and deep. - Right, sheriff. - And by the way, no more hunting in this area. and you can cut it with that sheriff crap. It's Will, we've been friends since kindergarten, you damn idiot. - Fuck you, Will. Scotty, what the hell you doing? - I was just taking a break, Jim. - You weren't sleeping, were you? - No, it wasn't sleeping, I swear. - You know how I feel about my men sleeping on the job. - I got you Jim, I wasn't sleeping. - Okay. Allen! - Yeah Jim? - [Jim] That's deep enough. - Sure, Jim. - [Jim] Take a break. Scotty, you see that boy over there? - Yeah, Jim. - He's like a brother to me. I promised his mom before she died that I'd take care of him. But you know what? If I had to, I'd rip his fucking eyes out of his skull and then shove them down his throat if I ever caught him sleeping on the job, you understand? - I got you, Jim, I wasn't sleeping. - [Jim] Okay, make sure of that. - You really don't think she looks like a teenager? I think she looks like a teenager. - Are you kidding me right now, Allen? I really wish you would just shut the fuck up. - Hey, what about this body? - [Scotty] We're getting to it, Jim. - Okay. - Come on. Oh sorry buddy. You sure the some bitch is dead, Jim? - Yeah, I got him good, got him good. - [Scotty] All right, get that arm. - Get him in the grave. Let's go. (ominous music) You guys did a good job of filling in the grave. - What about that buck I shot? We're taking that with us, aren't we? - Nah, we'll just leave that. That'll keep all the predators away from here. - That's true. - Let's get the fuck outta here. - You look tired. - I'm fine, dear. - Where's Fawn? - Sharon, she's fine. She's at your mother's. - Have you made all the arrangements? - Yes, but we can always go somewhere else. - We don't have time. The cancer's all through my body. Can you make me one promise? - Anything, baby, anything. - Just do everything you can to get Fawn out of this town and away from the drugs and the crime. - I promise. - Just don't let anything ever happen to her, John. Do everything you can to make sure no harm comes to her. - I promise. That's a promise I will keep.

We were talking about some deer hunting and I've been telling him about all the big bucks and stuff you got up here and- - What the sheriff's trying to get at is I'd like to accompany you (mumbles) Best damn tracker in the city. - Let's just say I'm over the (mumbles). (music drowns out talking) - You're asking the wrong man, Mr. Forsythe. - [Bill] Why do you say that? - This area's been hunted out for years. - How does one of the most mountainous regions in the state get hunted out? - Poaching for years. - Now hold on, Jim, there's that one secret spot. It's been weeks. There's probably some new sons of bitches up there. - I thought that place was over with. - I know, I know, but think Jim, it's been five years, this is five grand Jim. - Tell you what, Jim? We leave by tomorrow morning, I'll throw in an extra grand for your trouble. - How long do we have? - 10 days. - And if they don't hit the mark? - You keep $1,500 for your trouble. - Nah, it's gonna be $7,000, $2,000 if we don't hit the mark, and we get the money up front. - Damn it, Jim. - Deal. - Okay. Be here tomorrow morning parking lot at 6:30. By the way, Mr. Forsythe, (music drowns out voices) - [Bill] You got it. (music drowns out talking) - Sheriff, Bill, 6:30 a.m. (rock music) - This is Cori Lefler from WBOT Channel Nine News reporting. Just five months ago, the mutilated body of Amanda Gates was found here at this very location by a local fisherman. (rock music drowns out talking) Authorities say the Gates family was murdered and perhaps more at their family farm near Bottoms Creek. (music drowns out talking) - That shit is fucked. - Grab Allen and all the gear, parking lot, 6:30 a.m. - We got work? - 6:30 a.m. - All right, you're my boss. Sally. - What? - I'm settling up. - Fuck off, Scotty. (gentle music) - You're a regular trailblazer, Mr. Forsythe. - You can call me Bill. - What do you do for a living, Mr.Forsythe? - Oil rigging platforms. - Wait, you own oil rigs? - Man, I design 'em, draw 'em and build 'em. - Hey, ain't this that one place? - Shut up, Allen. Over here, over here. - Hot damn. - Set her up. - Where the fuck you been? - Fuck you, man, I had to shave. The old lady's been on my ass. - Right. Listen, sheriff, this ain't gonna be no 50/50 split. - What are you saying Jim? - Last time it was supposed to be 50/50 and you kept it all. - Christ, man, that was two years ago. Can't we put that one behind us? - This time it's gonna be 60/40. I get the extra 10% till I get my money back. - Fine. - Good. (ominous music) - Damn it, Allen, would you hold the fucking thing still? - I am. - Nice rifle. - 270. Bought her in Kansas in '85. - You know this ain't the flat land of Kansas here. Get yourself a 50 iron shot in here, you're God damn lucky. - What caliber would you suggest, Jim? - 42 straight to the head. - I'll remember that. - Allen, you got to pick up the other side. - Scotty, keep Allen away from that Forsythe guy. - Why, what's wrong? - Look around you. You know what happened five years ago here. - I don't understand. - When he gets around strangers, he's like a parrot on crack, just keeps squawking. - All right, you got it. - Okay, get this shit set up so we can set up the trail camps. Go. - Allen, we gotta move fast. We got the cams to set up. - All right, all right. - Pick up that end. - So what do you think our chances are? - Zero. - What do you mean zero? - Look, I'm the boss here. I say what goes on and what doesn't. Today, we're gonna scope out the place, we're gonna put some bait, we're gonna set up our trail cams. And if there's any trophies out here, we'll know about 'em by tomorrow. - Now, wait a minute, I paid you guys god damn good money for three days of hunting. And you tell me we're gonna waste the first day? - Yep, we only need two days. - I'll trust you on that, Jim. (ominous music) - Hey where you two going? - Heading out to set up some cams. - I'll go with you. - Yeah sure, sheriff, if you can keep up. - Hey, why are you idiots going up this way? - Gonna set the cams up at the top of the ridge. - No, that's the wrong place. - How's that the wrong place? - I talked to Jim earlier today and he's wants the cameras at the bottom of the ravine. - What ravine? - Don't listen to him, Scotty, he's lying to us. - Yeah, I'm lying. Then you two fuckers gonna have to explain to Jim why you put the cameras in the wrong place and fucked our hunt. - Okay sheriff, you know everything, then you lead the way. - Fine, let's go. (mysterious music) - Hey Jim. - Yeah? - I couldn't help to notice the tension between the sheriff and yourself. What goes there? - Long story. - Hey, I got two days. - My job's not to blow smoke up your ass with stories. It's to get the job done out here. - Fair enough. - Scotty, check it out. It's probably the buck I blasted five years ago. - Fucking moron, it's a doe, no horns. - Wait a minute, why the hell have you brought us around here, sheriff? - Scotty, you know as well as I do that this area's prime. - What's the matter, Scotty? - There ain't nothing wrong. Let's get moving. We only got one more camera to put up before dark. (ominous music) - Yeah, aim it up towards the trail. - Hey sheriff, this place looks kind of familiar. - Well, it oughta. It's where are you knocked off that little girl five years ago. As a matter of fact, just past that tree, that's where you and Scottie buried her and her pops too. - No, no, no, we should go home. We don't need to be here. - That's it, showtime. - Good, now we can get back and get some grub. What the hell's wrong with you, Allen? You look spooked. - Don't you know where the hell we are? - Sure, I know where we are. It's where you iced that little girl five years ago. - This place is fucking haunted, man. - Haunted, my ass, fucking grow up and get some balls. - Scott, what's wrong? - It's the grave, man, it's been dug up, it's empty. (ominous music) I told you guys this place was haunted. We should just get out of here. - This is kind of creeping me out right now. - Will you two just listen to yourselves? Jesus Christ, did either one of you happen to think that maybe, just maybe, animals dug him up and ate 'em? - Yeah, sure, animals dug him up. Can we just go to camp now? - Well, while we're still here, why don't we at least take a trail cam group photo? - Why the hell not? (ominous music) - So Jim, when are we checking the trail cams? - We'll pick them up first thing in the morning. - We're all set up, Jimbo, except three empty bellies. What the hell you been up to? - You can have yourself some chili. Don't fucking call me Jimbo again. - Yes, sir. - Hey sheriff, what's up with Allen? He looks a little spooked. - It's Allen, he's always spooked about something. And by the way, I'm leaving at daybreak. - Bailing on us again. That's one of your greatest traits, you know? - I am the sheriff. I do have another job besides dealing with you idiots. - Wait, you're not coming back? - I'll be back tomorrow afternoon. You guys just hold down the fort till I get back. - [Bill] Okay. (ominous music) - [Sheriff] I'll be back tonight. Good luck. - See you tonight, sheriff. - Yep. - Bill's first day at it. Get that thing on top of the hill. - I can smell them big bucks. - I just farted. - Hey, can we keep it down? Sounds like a fucking amusement park out here. - Here's the first one. - Okay. (ominous music) - Give me the card. We've got five images. - Come on baby, let's see some big buck. Let me see, Jim. Oh my God, look at the size of them bucks. - [Allen] Holy shit, we're gonna be rich. - Holy shit, Allen, you would know Rich if it pounded you in the fucking ass. - Fuck you, Scotty. - Okay, where's the other cam? - It's just down this way, it's not far. (ominous music) - Where'd you put the other cam? - Just down here in the hollow. - Why'd you put it down there? - I told him not to put it down there, Jim. - You didn't say shit, Allen, so why don't you shut the fuck up? - No, no, the sheriff. - The sheriff? - Yeah, he's the one that told us where to put the cams. - What's with the hollering? I'm the boss around here. From now on what I say goes, not the fucking sheriff. Let's go. (ominous music) - I swear it I didn't put this damn thing up this high. - Just get it down. - I'm fucking working on it. - Okay, we got four images. - Okay, what's the buck? - Are they buck? - What the fuck? - Jim, that's us. - What the hell? - No shit. - Is that another one? - Jim, you're the man. - Getting 'em on camera is one thing, killing 'em is another. - You let that up to me, brother. - There's another one. - That's a fucking raccoon. - Well, it has horns. - Scotty, when you activate the cams, don't walk in front of 'em. - That ain't me. I swear, Allen and I only pranked that one photo. I swear to God. - It's not me. - Fucking sheriff. - I take it there's bad blood between you and the sheriff. - Okay, let's pack up these cams and scout further up here. - Jim, if you don't mind, I'd like to set up around here. - Good enough. I'll come back around dark. This is just research, but if one comes by, take your shot. - You got it, Jim. - Good luck, Mr. Forsythe. - Good luck to you. (ominous music) - John? John? - I'm here, baby, I'm here. - Take my ribbon. I want you to give it to Fawn. - Sure. - She can wear it like I did for my wedding. - Absolutely, I'll make sure she wears it everyday. - You promise? - I promise. - I'm so cold, John. - It's all right. Want me to get you another blanket? I've got it right here. - No, I want you to go. - All right, well, I'll make sure I bring Fawn in tomorrow. Baby? Baby, Sharon, Sharon, come on, wake up. Sharon, come on, wake up, baby, no, no, no, come on, wake up. This ain't happening. Come on, Sharon! (crying) (mysterious music) - Scotty, this looks like a good place to set up a blind. Remember, Mr. Forsythe's 200 yards down here. - I got it. - Allen, I'll be back here before dark. - Good luck, Scotty. (laughing) - I was born lucky. - We'll be 200 yards down here so no lead coming that way. - You got it, Jim. - Okay. (ominous music) - Hey. This is where we're gonna set up the blind. - I thought I was gonna get my own spot. - Fucking kidding me? - If you don't mind me asking Jim, how come you don't use a stand? - No different than aiming from the ground, long as you cover up your scent. - Never really thought of it like that. - That's why you're staying with me. (ominous music) (gunfire blasting) - Oh you lucky bastard, one down, two to go. Come to papa. (gunfire blasting) - Shit, did you hear that? - What was that? - You think one of 'em got something? - That sounded further than Scotty. - You figure it was Mr. Bill? - Could've been. Let's go get Scotty. (ominous music) - Scotty, hey you heard that shot too? - Yeah. - Must've been Forsythe. - He thinks it's Forsythe. - Let's get going and get down and help him drag it out. It's almost getting dark. - Yeah, and I'm starving. - Yeah, let's go. (dark music) (chainsaw blaring) (dark music) - Holy shit, look at all that blood. - Damn, Forsythe busted him good, huh Jim? - He's dragging it into the woods the wrong way. - Why the hell would he drag it in deeper in the woods? - If Mr. Forsythe's such a great hunter like you said, why'd the dumb son of a bitch leave his gun and go the wrong direction? - I never said he was a great hunter. - We've got a problem. - Why you say that? - Let's go. (gentle music) - Come on. Oh you can. Just take her, please. - What's wrong? You okay? - No. (dark music) - Oh fuck. - Holy fuck! - Fuck! - Jim, I told you. I told you that wasn't me and Allen on the camera. I told you there's someone else out here. (men crosstalk) - [Scotty] Jim, what are we gonna do? - [Jim] We got to stay here tonight. Go get some firewood. - [Scotty] You gonna send me off by myself? - [Jim] Go get some firewood. We'll meet back at base camp. - [Allen] I just want to go the fuck home. (ominous music) - [Scotty] Go to your post, Scotty. Set up camera, Scotty. Why don't you dig a hole, Scotty? Hey, while you're at it, make sure Allen shuts the hell up, Scotty. God damn it, Jim, now it's pick up wood, Scotty. What is this? That's a fresh trail. Jim? Jim, I got a fresh trail and I'm gonna see where it leads to, with or without you. - Scotty should have been back by now, Jim. - Don't worry about Scotty. You just keep an eye out that way. - I'm just worried about him is all, Jim, I'm just worried about him. - He can take care of himself. We just gotta worry about ourselves right now. (ominous music) - That's just my luck. Follow the trail all the way in and ain't see shit. Fuck. (ominous music) (screaming) Jim! Jim! Jim! - Did you fucking hear that, Jim? - It sounded like a voice. - Yeah, I think it might've been Scotty. I got to go out there and get him, man. - You're not going anywhere, sit back down. - Come on, Jim man, he's my best friend. - Sit down. - What if he's in trouble? - Scotty'll take care of himself. You don't want to go out there in the woods at night time by yourself. We'll look for him in the morning. - I guess you're right, Jim, I'm just worried about him is all. - I am too. (ominous music) - Jim, do you think those screams really were Scotty? - We'll find out in the morning. Get some sleep. (ominous music) Allen. Allen, Allen! (ominous music) Scotty. What the hell? Let's play? Allen. (muffled screaming and crying) Allen, what the hell? (muffled screaming and crying) (gunfire blasting) (ominous music) You want to play a game? You sick fuck. Bring it on. Bring it on. Son of a bitch. (ominous music) (bird cawing) (ominous music) - Sheriff, we got to get out of here. Come on. No keys. Sheriff! Oh. Dear God, who the fuck would do this? (ominous music) Who the fuck are you? (ominous music) - Remember me now, son of a bitch? - You're dead, we fucking killed you. - You shouldn't have sent a boy to do a man's job. (grunting) - You son of a bitch. (grunting) - Die, die, die, die, die, die, die! That's for killing my fucking daughter and setting all this shit on me, bastard. (ominous music) You son of a bitch.

It has been three months since the sheriff's wife, Mary, reported him missing. He was last seen at the local bar Blondies and was supposedly going on a hunting trip here in these woods. The investigation is ongoing and if anybody has any information regarding to the sheriff's sudden disappearance, do contact your local authorities. Thank you. This is Cori Lefler with Bot Nine News reporting. - I think this is a spot. (grunting) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Every single time some dumb, corrupt, fat ass redneck sheriff gets lost out here, we got to go find his stupid ass. Man, I thought I got away from all this stuff after I went down south.
