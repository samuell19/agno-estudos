GIESE Krebs - H. KRUGER - You got a smoke? - Yes. Roll up a long one for me. - Someone seems to be talking. - Fritzes? Fritzes... C'mon, blast is stove to hell. - Who are you? - And who are you? Artillerists from Chuikov's army. Is that the 1st Byelorussian? And we're Rybalko's motorized infantry, the 1st Ukrainian Front. Our own! Well, greetings! - Greetings, neighbor. - Hi! Just imagine, all fronts got mixed up. Not mixed up, but joined up. The mistress of the house offers us coffee. Thank you. Comrade Major, maybe we'd better take a drop from my flask? - Let's drink on such an occasion. - That's right. They'll grow better. Well, to our meeting. You don't even know which districts the Russians have penetrated. Some Berlin Commandant you are! All communications are broken, my Fuhrer. But the telephones are working. That's communication, isn't it? For so long, for so long we haven't rested, We just had no time for it, alas. By the leopard crawl, half Europe we have breasted, And come tomorrow, the final battle, at last. A little more, just a little bit. The final battle is the hardest ever. And I yearn for Russia, home I want to get, For so long I haven't seen my mother. And I yearn for Russia, home I want to get, For so long I haven't seen my mother. Four years on end those Fritzes give us no peace at all, Four years it's salty sweat and blood with no end. I'd rather fall in love with a nice and pretty girl, I'd rather touch my homeland with my hand. A little more, just a little bit. The final battle is the hardest ever. And I yearn for Russia, home I want to get, For so long I haven't seen my mother. And I yearn for Russia, home I want to get, For so long I haven't seen my mother. For the last time we'll fight hand-to-hand tomorrow, For the last time we'll serve our Russia to the end... The Berlin Commandant speaking. Do you have Russians there? We have. What are they doing? Singing. What? Yes, they're singing, Herr Commandant. Are you the Russian or the German Commandant? German, damn it! They're on Wilhelmstrasse. The ring is closing up. My Fuhrer, we're no longer able to defend Berlin. I thought that if I stayed here all the soldiers would believe in our victory and come to save the city. And I'm still hoping for this. General Wenck's army is moving to Berlin! The will throw the Russians back. Goebbels, immediately get in touch with General Wenck. When will his army approach Berlin? When?! My Fuhrer, you need to rest. No. No, I'll wait for the news from Wenck. Wenck! Wenck is our salvation. Forward! Comrade Major, give me a canon to support us in the subway. The subway goes right to the Reich Chancellery. Want to take Hitler prisoner? And why not? You can never tell. - All right! - Thanks, Comrade Major. The cannon to be subway! You replace me here! Forward! Forward! Move it! Do as fine a work at the machinegun as though you're jewelers. Fire! Guys, follow me! Forward, boys! This way, quick! Come on, all together! Hey, brothers, let's move this monster together! Follow me! Forward! Halt! Halt! Where's the Reich Chancellery? Which way to Hitler? Can you sprechen Russian? Where's Hitler, I say? Oh, go to hell. Bring the cannon here. Forward! My Fuhrer, the Russians got into the subway tunnel and are approaching the subway station Kaiserhof. Open the floodgates and flood all the tunnels. There're hospitals and the wounded in the tunnels. Women and children. Open the floodgates! If we lose this war, the German nation will cease to exist. If our nation couldn't even subjugate the Slav peoples, it has no right to exist. The new generations will start from where we stopped. Do you believe me, Eva? I do, my Fuhrer. This is my order - let the Spree waters run into the tunnels! You three go forward. Move it! Ask him where the Reich Chancellery is and send him to meet his Maker. All right, Lieutenant, I don't need our advice, I can deal with it. Do you want a smoke? Thank you. You studied Russian? Yes, I did. What do you want from me, Herr Major? Herr Lieutenant gave you a good advice, to send me to meet my Maker. Why hurry? A Communist must not hesitate when he faces enemy. A Communist has no right to doubt. Your lieutenant has no doubts. You don't know Communists at all. We don't need your life. We want only one thing to destroy fascism. Go. If you take up arms again, you'll be shot. Go. You're free. Go. The Reich Chancellery is over there, not far from here. Comrade Major, they opened floodgates. We must leave. There's an exit on the left, from where we were attacking. We won't make it. - Blow up the grating. - Yes, blow up the grating. Get down! Down! Comrade Major! Comrade Major, we must leave! We must leave! Quiet. Calm down. We must leave! Yartsev! Come here and hold back the crowd, let only women and children through. Back up! Let the women and children through. Hold them back! No panicking! Hold the crowd back! No panicking! Calm down! Get out of the car! Commander of the 150th Infantry Division Major-General Shatilov Comrade General, Captain Neustroyev's battalion has reached the Spree. The Reichstag is ahead. Yes, there it is, the Reichstag. Well, Lieutenant-Colonel Orlov, we got to the center of Berlin. That's right, Comrade General. The last nut to crack. The Germans are fighting like the devils. Not going to capitulate. One way or another, but we'll have to force the Spree and take the Reichstag. - Where's Neustroyev's command post? - Just next to us, Comrade General. Attention! Look more serious. Look in the camera Get ready. Ready. One. Two. Three. - Have you snapped. - How could I? It's a Party assignment, not some tourist snapshots. I understand. Let's do it once more. Sit down. The general. Comrade General, the battalion is tidying up after battle. I can see. Sparing no eau-de-Cologne. That's right, Comrade General. - Take me to the regiment commander. - Yes, Comrade General. What's going on here? Making photos for Party cards. Deputy Battalion Commander for Political Instruction Lieutenant Berest. Where do you plan to award Party cards to our young Communists? We'll do it in the Reichstag, Comrade General. That's right. Good for you, political officer. Comrade General. Commander of the 756th Rifle Regiment Colonel Zinchenko. Now, Zinchenko. I'm handing this banner to you. Your regiment is to hoist it on the Reichstag. Thank you, Comrade General. Who will carry the banner? Scout Yegorov! Here! Scout Kantaria. Here! Hoist this banner on the Reichstag dome. BERLIN April 29 Battery commander! Commander of the tank company Vasilyev is here to be at our command! You will assist us with fire! All right, I got you! Dorozhkin, go to the battalion. I'm sending you a radio man! Comrade Captain, I can't swim. Don't worry, you'll be all right. Come here. My Fuhrer. The Russians are 600 meters away from the Imperial Chancellery. We don't have ammunition. No provisions. The last airfield has been burned by Russian artillery. And where's Wenck's army? Where's Wenck? My Fuhrer, Wenck is waging a battle in the Potsdam area. He can't break through to Berlin. Is that all? That's all, My Fuhrer. Thank you, gentlemen. You can go. My Fuhrer. I was delivered a radiogram. Benito Mussolini and his girlfriend Clara Petacci were hanged by the partisans upside down, in the Piazzale Loreto in Milan. What a terrible cruelty. My Fuhrer, there's an opportunity to breakthrough out of Berlin. I have a tank detachment ready. No. Leave us alone. I don't want to die as our mistress. All right, Eva. We'll have a wedding. Leave me alone! What wedding can it be now? Leave me alone! Comrade Commander. We caught their priest. He's weird, seems not to be in his right mind. Koshelev, find out what this priest wants. Yes, Comrade Commander. Commander of the 8th Guard Army Colonel-General Chuikov Concentrate all fire on the Reich Chancellery. Yes, concentrate all fire on the Reich Chancellery. Did you find out what this priest wants? He keeps talking about some wedding. He says it's time to stop the bloodshed. And he's right. A politically conscious priest. Send him to the antifascists. Let his God speak to the German soldiers, if they're still believers. It's the National Committee for a Free German speaking. We're calling on you to lay down arms. Thus you will save your lives. The new Germany needs you. Surrender! Surrender! Father, this is a German patriot, comrade Willi, an antifascist. He's been transmitting for two days. Join, Father, in the just cause. Germans, my brothers. It's I who is asking you, the pastor of St. Georg Church. Stop. Stop. Does the groom wish to say anything? I've decided to choose as my wife Eva Braun, with whom I'm bound by many years of true friendship. And she will go with me to death of her own free will as my wife. Does the bride wish to say anything? I'll be happy to be Adolf Hitler's wife. - Do you belong to the Aryan race? - Yes. - Do you have any hereditary diseases? - No. Seal your answers with your personal signatures. I congratulate Adolf and Eva a new happy family of the great Germany. BERLIN April 30 - Berest, go ahead with the 1st company. - Yes. Forward! Follow me! Forward! Boys! Follow us, forward! Follow me! Tell the colonel that we've secured the first floor. Tank-man, come here. Connection with the colonel, quick! What? The first floor taken? Good boys! Connection with the general. You've gained the first floor? Good for you! Go on! - Connection with the commander. - Yes. You've taken the first floor? Why does it take you so long! The banner, quick! Hoist the banner, you got me? Commander of the 3rd Shock Army Colonel-General Kuznetsov Get me the Marshal! You've taken the first floor? It's slow, you move too slowly, General. Put me through to Comrade Stalin. The Fuhrer must die not from poison, but from a bullet, like a soldier. If we don't hear a shot, you will go in and do what has to be done. Yes, sir. Linge! Linge! The Fuhrer has shot himself. Follow me! Tank-man! Give me quick connection with ours. Will do. Let them fire at the upper floors. "Boxes"! "Boxes"! I'm "Reichstag"! Our brothers ask for fire. At the wolfs lair! More exactly, at their head! Did you copy? Over. They did it. Never mind, in a tank it can be even worse. Sure. What's the matter? Listen, boy. BERLIN May 1 And Jesus said to his apostles: For whoever exalts himself will be humbled. Germany wanted to exalt herself, and she has died. No, father, Germany is not dead. It's not the end, but the beginning of a new Germany. Who are you? I'm a Communist. Please cease fire! We're sending out truce envoys. You'll recognize them by a white flag. Attention! We ask to cease fire! And these who heard His words kept them in their hearts. And He said to the apostles: remember... I'm Chief of the German Army General Staff General Krebs. We're listening, General Krebs. I have to inform you that on April 30 Adolf Hitler committed suicide in his bunker. Grossadmiral Doenitz has been appointed the new head of state, Dr. Goebbels the Reich Chancellor. The former German government no longer exists. Reich Chancellor Dr. Goebbels has authorized me to ask you for ceasefire for one day. To what purpose? So that Grossadmiral Doenitz and the new government could arrive in Berlin. No, General Krebs. We won't agree to any ceasefire, either for a day, or for an hour. Only complete and unconditional surrender. I'm not authorized to conduct negotiations about surrender. There will be new thousands of victims. Will you pass on to Moscow our request about the ceasefire? The answer will be the same. How will know about the answer from Moscow? We'll establish direct telephone communication with the Reich Chancellery. The signalman! Comrade General, Senior Lieutenant... Translate to the German that the senior lieutenant will go with him. You'll go with the German general to the Reich Chancellery. - To the lair? - Yes, to the lair. May I take grenades? No grenades. You'll establish communication. Yes, Comrade General. You got a really lousy place here. You can get rheumatic alright. Go, go. Here. "Stalingrad", "Stalingrad". I'm "Berlin". It's all right. No capitulation. If we recognize unconditional surrender, the German people will lose everything. In these tragic hours for Germany I'm ready to follow the Fuhrer's example. Bormann, try to break through to the west, to our friends. Krebs, tell the Russians that there will be no capitulation. Are you ready, Magda? Not yet. The doctor is wavering. I'm sorry, Frau Goebbels, I can't kill children. Maybe we'll pass them under the protection of International Red Cross? Don't forget that they're Goebbels's children. Give me the syringe. Excuse me, where do you have a toilet here? What do you want from me? Go away! There will be no negotiations. - Well, all right, no negotiations - Go away now. You'll shoot at the back of our heads as we walk up. It's more than I can bear, Herr Reich Minister. You want the Russians to hang us upside down? Do it! Yes, it's a really lousy place you have here. BERLIN May 2 Georgy Konstantinovich, Chuikov's on the line. Chuikov? What? Comrade Marshal. The Hitlerites put out a white flag, they're surrendering. Repeat it. The Hitlerites put out a white flag in the Reichstag, they're surrendering. Congratulations to you, Chuikov! Congratulations! Is it really the end, Georgy Konstantinovich? Four years. 1,410 days. And nights. Comrade Marshal. The Berlin garrison asks you to tune to frequency 440. Attention, Russians! Tune to wave 440. We ask you to cease fire. We ask you to cease fire and enter the negotiations. Go over to transmitting. Transmit. We have only one condition - an unconditional surrender. Cease fire in 15 minutes. We'll be taking prisoners at the Brandenburg Gate. We guarantee life to everybody. We guarantee life to everybody. Well, you alive, infantry? Congratulations. Haven't you seen Dorozhkin, my radio man? Is there Dorozhkin here? Dorozhkin! Dorozhkin! Dorozhkin! Dorozhkin! They killed him. Vaska. Vaska! Vaska. Why are you crying? It's victory!
