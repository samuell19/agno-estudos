[Music] Here meet Tony, a Finelli The "Once and Future King"... He has a golden throat. This man was born to sing. His agent was the "Yang" to his Italian "Ying". But they signed away their lives to a big criminal ring. Now the Dupe's Become the "Super". In the house he used to own. Tony's eating "Humble pie" She's his "Ex-". His kids are grown. Who'd a thought that a Finelli would do windows and floors, while he's knocking, knocking, knocking at Fame and Fortune's door. Hello, can I come in? Yes here's Tony a Finelli. He takes it on the chin. After 15 years where life was always set on "Spin". Lands on his feet or on his belly. He stands up with a grin. So, meet Tony, a Finelli, an American in Berlin. Today in Germany recording star Tony Finelli was sentenced to 15-years for his connections to the mafia boss Mister Big. That was then and this is now. Nearly 25 years after he shocked the entertainment world, with his unexpected arrest, the voice from New York is back. It's a big night for Tony Finelli fans, as he celebrates his World Premiere of his new musical, Love Will Never Die in a pre-Broadway Tryout at the Chicago Theater. Join me, Barbara Bischof, in a one-on-one exclusive interview with the man of the hour, Tony Finelli. Come in. Barbara, lovely to see you again. It's been a long time. So now you're British, Tony. I've been working on this British accent because I got to play a vampire, and nobody here thinks they got bloodsuckers in Brooklyn. But they've never been to my old neighborhood. We have known each other a long time. Five years go when you started your comeback I was the first people to interview you. Yes you were. And while I'm thinking about it, can I offer you perhaps a cup of coffee? Not that I want to make advertising, just a little promotion. Oh. Your last tour was a massive success. How many countries were you in? Sixteen. Here you are five years later back up on top with your name in lights. What does that feel like? Pretty d*** good, I got to say. Well, what a journey this has been... I'm coming home. Open that door. It's time to turn the key. After 15 long years baby I'm finally free. There's no more waiting. What the f***? Where's all the paparazzi? What are you nuts? You called the press? I'm getting out of prison. This ain't the academy awards. Come on. Tina and the girls will be here to pick us up. Let's go. You got money for a cab?? No. Come on. Listen to that, birds. I ain't heard a bird sing in 15 years. So what? Even after all this time, I'm still behind bars. Let's try the other gate. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I got this. I got this. Move. It don't fit anymore. What the f*** did you Tony, you thought that was going to work after all this years? Tina probably changed the g**** lock like 15 seconds after we got f***** sentenced. Forget about 15, kiss my m***** ass years. Tina, Lola, Lina, Daddy's home. Daddy's home. Tony, I didn't tell you, all right, but, a couple of weeks ago, I got paper's from Tina's low-life, piece of s*** m***** ass lawyer. Jürgen, why do you curse like that? You ain't from Brooklyn. You're German. German's don't talk like that. And this ain't no Scorsese film. What the f***. Do you think I don't know what my stupid-ass nationality is? When I was 13 years old, I watched "Goodfellas" 16 times in a row. That s*** got stuck with me, man. You got a screw loose. Probably a few. Look, I should have told you, but the f*** divorce has gone through. Well give me a f**** break. Jürgen. Oh, that mouth. Do come in. Hey. Come on man. Nobody sings that like my Tony. Bea, would you knock it off? You'll wake up the dead. Shhhh, Sta' zitto. It's my Tony. I love when he sings in Italian. Pete, what did you do? Where are we gonna put all this stuff? What's the matter with you? There was a yard sale. It was a deal. I couldn't resist. It's a small apartment. How many TV's do we need? I was thinking about one for Nonna's room. Not enough salt. Ma, don't eat that. It's raw. Non mangiare, Mamma. She don't even know if a meatball is raw or cooked anymore. What is she going to do with a TV? Yesterday, she threw her radio out the window. She said it was possessed by the devil. Come here. Don't touch my hair. Took me half-an-hour to get that thing glued on right. I had to put it on twice. First time, I wasn't wearing my glasses and put it on backwards. I looked like a squirrel caught in a hurricane. No, I can touch what I want. 53 years and I know every hair on your head, including the ones we bought. Wow, nice. Thanks a lot. Oh, so sorry, Jailbait. I forgot you exist. Wow, nice threads. Must be strange not to be wearing a Jailhouse Uniform, huh? My, you smell great. What are you wearing? "Success." Yours or His? Speaking of smells, how were the showers in jail, Mr. Macho? Oops, don't drop the soap. I guess you were the "Belle of the Balls". Well Sir, I cleaned up the kitchen. And I have painted the wall. And we are done with the office. We're not lazy. Ooh, take a joyride. Now it's funtime. I am the boss here. Come and get undressed. Take a joyride. Welcome to the playground Tony. You are the best here, yes I must confess. Take a joyride, Tony. I am the boss here, come and get undressed. Take a joyride. Welcome to the playground, it's all right. You are my favorite. Yes I must confess. Oh, here's my plan, tony, let me show you everything that I'm planning, yeah. It's time to leave behind all that nonsense. Time for pleasure. Tony? Tony? Tony I'm talking to you. You realize, that we are divorced now. I didn't sign no divorce papers. It ain't legal. Oh, this from Mr. Repeat Offender. Jürgen, please inform Forrest Gump that after 3 years of separation, a divorce without consent is possible. Come on guys, knock it the f*** off. I wanted to see you in person, before I signed the papers. I wanted to look you in the eyes. There. Seen enough? Tina, you look f*** incredible. It's amazing what not having a LOSER in the house does for one's complexion. Really? I thought that came from drinking the blood of innocent virgins. Jürgen, please tell the "Deadbeat Dad" that as per our divorce agreement, I keep the house, but he has use of the attic apartment. The attic apartment?? How generous. You shouldn't have. I wouldn't have. Tell him, he can see the girls as he'd like... but good luck with that. Come on Tina, what the f*** do I look like, g**** Western Union? Talk to him. They're your f**** kids. If you take my lipstick again, I'm going to dismember your Teletubby collection. Look who's talking. You're still a member of the official Barney Fanclub. "I love you, you love me..." Mom. Mom. That may be dangerous. Dad. Dad. Hi there. Lena. Smart girl. She knows when something is rotten. Don't mind her. You know how she is. The "ice queen." She doesn't have a heart, she has Intel inside. Why is she so angry? She doesn't really remember you anymore. That must have been incredibly difficult for you? From one day to the next, you were gone. I think it was the hardest for my family. I mean my daughters. Especially Lola my eldest, she was, old enough to sort of understand, you know, what was going on. But you know it couldn't have been... it wasn't easy for anybody. That must have been amazing after such a long time to finally hold your daughters in your arms? You can't imagine. You know when I was finally got back home, I just, I just wanted to be the most loving father I could possibly be, and you know, do all those Father-Daughter thing, you know, like "normal". Thanks. I had a really nice time. Me, too. What are you doing on Saturday? Well, I got work, but with the right guy I might be available. Am I the right guy? Give me a kiss and I'll let you know. Hey. Dad. What is this? It's not what, who. This is Helmut. And what is this "Helmut" doing kissing in my daughter in my staircase? Hello Mr. Finelli. I'm a big fan. Shut up, kid. You're Road kill. Put him down right now. If you hurt my daughter, I hurt you. Capisch? I'm not gonna hurt anyone. You got that damn right. Let's go. I'm 27 years old, not 10 anymore, Dad. This is not your house and this is none of your business. I'll call you. Who the hell do you think you are? You humiliated me. Don't talk to me like that. I'm your father. Since when? You've been gone for 15 years. What are you doing with that jerk? I'm trying to have a life. And he's not a jerk, but you sure are acting like one. Me? What? Come on. All right, so maybe I overreacted a little. Overreacted? You called him "Roadkill". I just don't want you to get hurt. Well you're a little late. What do you mean? At 16 years old I was nearly raped on my way home one night. That is when I needed you, not with some sweet guy who just wanted to give me a kiss. It was by Sauvigny Platz. And it was late. And it was dark. I had my headphones in and I was walking. Why did nobody tell me? What for? You were in prison. I should have been there for you Lola. I guess I overreacted, with Helmut, huh? Yeah, I think he's scarred for life, now. Actually, I think he took a dump in his pants. Sure smelled that way. It's just that I'm not used to seeing you like that. Like what? I'm a grown woman. And he was a nice guy. And now, you've ruined everything again. I'm sorry. You're sorry? How can I make it up to you? Just stay out of my business... Charming as always, I see. I guess I got carried away. Tony, upset my daughter again and I'll have you carried away in a wooden box. No need. I'll just stand next to you and freeze to death. There's a course, "How To Win Friends and Influence People." Enroll. Lena, Lena my little one, she was 5 when I got sent to prison. She was a high school graduate when I got out. You know, and then, I was a convicted criminal. I mean, it's not exactly something you brag about to your friends. Tony, I'm a mother, I can't even imagine what that must have been like. My daughter Lena, that she grew up without her father, that's something I can't forgive myself for. Why did you stop playing? That was beautiful. Tony. Don't call me Tony. I am your father. If you are my father, why did you abandon me? It's not like I had a choice. I got arrested. But you didn't do anything wrong. For two weeks every day after school I went to the courthouse. I read the legal briefs. You did what? Well that's funny. You know I was the one in prison when they talked to be about legal briefs. I thought they meant the underwear that I wore in court. You were innocent. Said no one, never. Would you please, you're not helping. Honey, there are things that I can't explain to you right now. I wish I could. Finelli, have a seat. Agent Schmitt will be in. If you need me I'll be right outside the door. So Mr. Finelli, Tony, as you well know, the Gamberetto Family has a big interest in discretion. So I would like to know the name of the "little birdy" who keeps singing. This is some kind of joke? I don't know nothing about no stupid "Birdy." Don't give me that. I know that Jürgen talks to you about everything. Jürgen does the business. I do the singing. That's our deal. I don't know what you're talking about. Take your time, Finelli. Take your time. I got all night. But at one point you have to answer me. Agent Schmitt, it's your wife. Says it's an emergency. Okay. I'll be back. Like I'm going somewhere. Prego, Don Niccolo. Avanti. Finelli, listen carefully. Who are you? Sono Niccolo Gamberetto, Mr. Big. Mr. Big. You. All right, what is this, Candid Camera? Where's the camera huh? You and Manager take the dive. No questions. If you open your mouth, you're dead. He's dead. Tina, Lola and Lena dead. The Manager's family dead. You play along and the Gambaretto Family will take care of you and them, for the rest of your lives. You know, you know my kids names? Tony, niente giocchi. Do what I say and live. Non lo fai? Siete tutti morti. Tony, now let's talk about Mr. Big. Barbara, now let's not and say we did, okay. This is Yvonne, my makeup genius. This makeup takes some time, so she's going to start my makeup while we continue to talk, all right? Hello Yvonne. Okay Tony. Now back to Mr. Big. You went to prison for a mob boss, a ruthless criminal, and no one really knows what happened. Did you cut a deal? Barbara, next question, move on. Did he pay you off? Did he pay you off? Don't go there. Did he make you, excuse the pun, did he make you an offer you couldn't refuse? It's not funny. You know we had a deal. This is not cool. You're right. This isn't cool. I'm sorry. You know, I had to put in the writer. You're not supposed to ask questions about Mr. Big. Don't say you're sorry if you don't mean it. You asked that question on purpose. You have no idea. I had no choice. That man, he threatened to destroy everyone and everything that I ever cared about. I walked away from everything that I spent a lifetime building. Because otherwise everybody I ever loved would have been dead. Is that thing on? You taped, turn that thing off. You cannot use, no, no, you cannot use any of that. Calm down, Tony, calm down. This could be good for you. No. Turn that off. The people will finally find out who you really are. No. Tony? Earth to Loser. I'm talking to you. Huh? Since you were "otherwise engaged" most of her life, you might like to know that Lena is the valedictorian of her class and has been accepted to attend Harvard in the Fall. I'm so proud of you. Thank you Mom. And of you Lola. Wow, Lena, that's incredible. Can I have a hug? Sure: That was strange. Yeah, Dad she got in under the "affirmative action" rule. They affirmed that she was mental. Hey. Hands, hands, watch your hands. Lola, don't be jealous. Me? Jealous? Yeah. I made you something while I was away. Oh, goody. Prison Presents. You girls must be so proud. Daddy it's amazing. I remember that. You used to make up stories for us at bedtime. Show me your new trick, come on. I want to see. Very good. Now come on, jump over here. Let's go. Boom. Very good. Hey, you want Bibo Bear? Yeah. All right, now, let's read a story. Come close, close, close, close. Let's finish where we were. Then Gaston goes up to Belle and says, I'm going to use my... No Daddy, not this one. Tell us the story about the Circus again. Yeah, the ones that fly, the ones that fly. You want to hear the story of the "The Flying Finellis"? Yeah. Oh no. Are you sure? Yeah. Well aren't you two the luckiest girls in Berlin because I just finished the "Flying Finelli" Comic book, just for you two monkeys. All right. Let's go. Come on, all right. Here we go. "Once upon a time not too far from here, The Fratelli Gumba Bumba Circus came to town. The stars of the circus were "The Flying Finellis" -- Tony, Tina and the smart, brave and powerful Lola and Lena. The younger sister Lena, was fast and light as a bird. She dared to do the upside-down triple flip and eat candy corn at the same time. Lola, the older sister had magical, beautiful hair which gave her amazing strength. Lola could lift anything, except this dark cloud that was hanging over her family's head. The Gumba Bumba Circus was in trouble. Ticket sales were down. Lola and Lena were very worried. If the circus closed, what would happen to the "Flying Finellis?" Until one day Lena, as she was prone to do, came up with a brilliant idea. Well if I had known, how things was gonna turn out, I would have drawn three Flying Finellis and a Lady Vampire. Hilarious. Now, would you please go to your own apartment? It starts to smell like prison in here. Here's the key. Oops. Come on, Dad, I'll help you bring your things upstairs. Okay. Are you coming, Brainiac? Fine. Oh my God, what is that smell? What the f***? Man. Tony. What a smell. What is all this stuff? Oh I forgot to tell you. Until last week, I was renting this apartment to a pet store for their manure storage. Oops. I guess they forgot to clean up. Hell that's gross. Jürgen. Fury. Don't worry Dad, I'll help you clean it up. Lola, you don't have to do this. Girls did you know that your father's job in the "big house" was cleaning up the prison? I hate my life for sure. Wish I had a knife for sure. Sick of cleaning, sick of kicked. Sick of cleaning and sick of grit. Oh I hate my life, yeah. Are we having a party? We? What we? There's you. There's me and there's the door. Use it. You know, your butt must be so jealous of all the crap coming out of your mouth. You're pretty funny. The "Ice Queen" melts. No, no, no! Three plates. So, "Mr. Big Shot Has Been", how are you going to make money now? Mama, Daddy's a great singer. He should sing. Yes, Tony should definitely sing. What, "Jailhouse Rock?" I want to play my role. You got a scene with me. I'm acting like a beast but you can free me. Be fast and see I'm chasing you so riled and smug. Yes, it's love my trophy cup, oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The main line. I feel so fine. She brings out a bottle of a little wine. I'm so crazy, I don't want to get no one else. Please take my hand and I will do my best. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. She's acting me right off of the stage. She knows her lines and says them in a subtle way. I'm confident that she will be my bride someday. Yes it's love. My trophy cup. Yeah, yeah. Mr. Melek is no longer here, so the apartment is yours to use. But you'll have to pay rent of course. What's a Mr. Melek? Who's that? He takes care of the guestrooms around the house, and fixes stuff. Like a Super, like a Janitor. What guest rooms? Mamma rents rooms out like Air BnB. What the f**** is that? Michael Jordan has a hotel? BnB -- Bed and Breakfast. You left me with nothing except all the costs and all the responsibilities. What was I supposed to do? So like everyone else, you can pay rent. I ain't paying rent. This is my house. Was. Was your house. You got 15 years. I got the mortgage. Tina, I just got out. You got to give me some time. Time is money. Like you Americans say, "In God We Trust". All others pay cash. Tina, I'm already working on some stuff, but it won't happen overnight. Wait a minute. I just got an idea. Mamma, Mr. Malik quit last month, right? Yeah. Since Daddy doesn't have a job, why can't he do it? What, me, be the Super? Wait a minute, I promised myself after Moabit, I would never mop again. Remember, Daddy? Clean up your own backyard before you go knocking on your neighbor's door. Drugstore candy's sweet but not free. Guess you believe the same is true for me. Cleaning, washing dishes ain't my future. Time for plain talk now between you and me. Well I need a cat and not a little kitty. Because I am so pretty. Damn, I'm fun and witty. Now, a little bitty guy will pretend he don't know that you and I we don't belong. Tony you're old brain's scarred. Oh, understand me, this is a sign. and Hallelujah baby. Grow up and go take charge. You clean and don't protest and we'll be fine. You tend to your business. I'll tend to mine. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah. Daddy, please take the job. And then we can see each other every day. I need to talk to you, come. What? Just go in there. We'll be right back. Don't worry. What is it? You know, it ain't such a bad idea when you think about it. We've been gone for 15 f**** years. In the music business, that's like dying. Actually, we could make more money with you if you're f**** dead Ha ha, very funny. So, we're starting at zero. No, we're starting below zero. What the f*** is below zero? Negative one. You know there's only three kinds of people in the world, those who can count, and those who can't. Huh? Whatever. All I know is we got really f****** f***** by that guinea b****** Mr. Big. Yeah, but I got two left hands. Jürgen you know that. "Fake it until you make it." Just f**** fake it Tony. Take the job. At least it will put a roof over our heads and buy us some time until we get back on our feet. Man. I mean I would get to see the kids every day and Tina. That chick is as cold as a nuclear winter man. Yeah. She hasn't been the same since that girl from Kansas dropped that house on her sister. So what do you say? I don't know. I got to think about it. Great, come on. Hey, hey, wait a minute. Tony's going to take the job. Tony, I know times were tough, but why on earth, did you agree to work as the janitor in you own house. Wait a minute, it was your ex-wife's house. All hell would freeze over before I would work as a janitor in my ex-husband's house. Whose idea was that? It sure wasn't mine. Then why did you do it? Are you a masochist Tony? You'll have to ask my shrink. Actually, if you think about it, it wasn't so crazy. I wanted to be near my daughters. I wanted to put my family back together. Family is important to me, so you do what you gotta do. Hey Girls, where are you going? Grandma called. She needs some help. Lena, where's your shoes? Grandma's stretching them for me. Yeah, she used to do that for me, too. Do you think Nonna has had a bath? She always smells like "old lady." She's 88. What do you expect? Actually, she sort of smelled that way when I was a kid, too. You know maybe it's a "Sicilian thing". Sort of like a mix of garlic and, nah, let's not go there. Anyway, tell Grandma I'll be upstairs just as soon as I make this hallway my own. You fly girl. I like how you twirl. Yeah, yeah. Oh my God, Dad, Dad stop, stop, stop. Why? You're so weird. You look ridiculous. Aw. It's amazing how much you sound just like your mother. You, you used to love my imitation of the Godfather. Yeah, I was three. Well, I got soul, girls. You can't keep a man down who got soul. You fly girl. You look like a pearl. - You fly girl. - You fly girl, yeah, yeah. You look like a pearl. Come on. Sing it. I would, I could, I want you. Hey, hey, aw. Whazzup my ****? Wait a minute man, you can't call me that. Tony, Tony, I can say whatever the hell I want to say. I mean come on, people been calling me that my whole life. Now I finally met somebody blacker than me. Look man, you can call me whatever you want, but I ain't using, you know like the N word, you know, you. How are you saying I'm blacker than you? Dude, because when you sing, you've got soul. All right, ugly soul, ugly soul. Soul, I got soul. Soul sing, come on man. Now wait, wait. Come on, really, you told me your Grandmother was from, where is she from? She's from Sicily. Sicily, right. I think about it. She was probably getting it on with some of the brothers overseas in Africa, mm-hmm. No, I don't even want to think about them. Man, you're messing up my groove. Come on, let's sing. All right. Got to slice. Got to slice. It's going to taste nice. It's going to taste nice. Cut a slice. Cut a slice. It's going to taste nice. Oh, oh, oh. You're killing me. You're killing me. I could. I want you. Oh, help me. It's over. You're crazy man. Take me out of here. I feel like the walking dead. The walking dead? That explains why you're so slow. Sing less. Work more. Wow you look amazing. Got a hot date? I'm going shopping. Where, at the "Millionaire Matchmaker?" I just threw this together. Well honey, you can throw it my way. I don't do felons. Really? Well then that's the only thing you don't do. I just spent the last hour fixing the turnstile on your bedroom door. You know it's burned out from all the traffic. I'm laughing on the inside. Don't hold it in, you might explode. That was a joke, some people laugh. Yeah, I forgot, mummies are rust. I don't even know why I wrote this but it just came out of me. I don't know. Hey, you know Mike and I, we're working on a new song last night. You're telling me this because? It's about you. Why? It's cheaper than therapy. Dial the number in the pain. But then the circus starts again. Don't touch that phone, let it die. You know I like to watch you squirm, you know what I mean? I don't know why. Hate my weakness, it ain't me. Must let you go, but can't break free. A twisted love straight from the day two. I've been super-glued. Super-glued to you. Must leave your space. Must stay clear. Cannot let you too near. You're kryptonite, a lighted fuse. Since I met you, I'm just confused. I feel like the walking dead. With a zombie heart and you in my head. And I ain't been so low so long. My life's become a country song. That's better than the other word, all right. We should do that. Just empty rooms, the phone don't ring. No videos, no Whatsapp ping. The Twitter feed of me and you is all dried up, I know it's true. You caught me in your laser beam. You seared my brain, my heart still screams. Don't want to be alone again. But here I am, feeling insane. I feel like the waking dead. With a zombie heart and you in my head. And I ain't been so long so low. My life's become a country song. I don't know who I've become. I'm so confused, want to feel like numb. And I dream of what might have been. I'm feeling so confused again. I'm feeling so confused again. Here is a Euro, Tony. Call someone who cares. Wow. Hey Tina, Missis Finelli, why are you having me paint these walls again? I mean the color is perfectly fine. Why are you wasting my time like that? Why does a dog lick his privates? Because he can. Excuse me, Mr. Brown, Daddy. Yes, yes, that would be me. I have a question. Why did you name me Lola? Like Lola Finelli, it's like a cheap nightclub Las Vegas act. You're lucky, your mother wanted to call you Lodmela. When I was a boy in the 70's, Lola Falana was the hottest thing on wheels. She was a big star in Las Vegas, but I can tell you she sure did not work cheap. And you my darling, before you even ask, you were named after the great Lena Horne, one of the best singers of all time. Look at this color, this is unbelievable. Dad, they're both black. So what? We're not. I wouldn't be so sure of that. You know Nonna is from Sicily. And like my buddy Mike always says "It's just like a hop, skip and a jump to Africa from there. Yeah, we got to dance. Please tell me that it was love at first glance. Please tell me that I still have a chance. Please tell me that we are going to dance. Going to dance, dance, dance. Going to dance, dance, dance. We've got to break this hypnotic trance. You and me are stuck in this broken romance. We got to dance. We got to dance yeah. D-D-D-D-Dance. I got to dance. D-D-D-D-Dance. You got to dance. We want to dance. D-D-D-D-Dance. I love to dance. D-D-D-D-Dance. I got to dance. D-D-D-Dance. You got to dance. Alrighty. Here we go. Oh, oh no. There. We got this. I need to think. Here we go. Oh no. This is impossible. Look at this mess. You're fired. You're fired. You're fired. You can't fire me. I mean slaves have to be sold. You're a mess you baby. Ow. What are you doing? Don't whack your sister. Don't even think about it Jailbird. Tony, how did this happen? Well I was working on a new song and I started to dance a little bit. You know you could see it as modern art. No!! It could happen to anyone. No, not anyone. Just you. You again making a mess of my life. Again. Why did I agree to this? Because you love me. You wanna marry me again. Because you think I'm sexy and you want my body. I'd rather have my teeth drilled without Novocain. That can be arranged. Please you guys, knock it off. Help him clean up. Tina, are you coming? I'm gonna cook. I made pasta. Tempting, but I have to watch my figure. Oh come on, you eat like a bird. A vulture. Tina, come, you got to eat something. You need a little meat on your bones. Ma, knock it off already. She's on a liquid diet, blood. Tony. Ignore him, Bea. The rest of the world does. Tina, you know you are always welcome. Like the black plague. Tony, your working clothes arrived this morning. Here. Very funny. I'm laughing on the inside. Dad, give me a hand, would you? From prison to being a janitor, to now starring in big budget musical. Your manager must be thrilled. Yeah, well you know Jürgen. I got my family, you know, then there is Jürgen. We've been together since the beginning of my career. He's sort of like, he's like the brother I never really had. When, you know, when he got out of prison he helped me rebuild everything. Does he motivate you? Or do you motivate him? How does it work between you two? No, No, No, you got that all wrong. See Jürgen is like that rabbit on television, you know with the batteries in the back, it just keeps going, and going, and going. Actually he's more like a mosquito, you know, flying around your face and don't leave you alone. He's like relentless. Sometimes I like to just give him. I love Jürgen, really I do. He's in a class by himself. And sometimes I'd like to put him on a planet by himself. Come on. Come on. Get out of my face with that thing. I'm starving. What the f*** is your Problem, Finelli? It ain't my fault that I got such an un-f****** believable metabolism. I just look at that and I gain weight. You shovel it in, and nothing happens. It ain't fair. Fair? Nobody ever said life is f**** fair, you stupid, f****, singing, son-of-a b***. You know, with that mouth of yours, I can't take you anywhere. You gotta knock it off. B****, with that big-ass gut of yours, the only f**** thing I could book you at is at a f**** Weight Watchers Convention. You got to lose some f**** weight. Is there an echo in here? You sound just like Tina. You need a makeover. And you need a therapist. I ain't kidding. Neither am I. Tony, that's not f**** 6-pack, it's a keg. That ain't no f**** pushup either. Okay, Mister Wise Guy, if you think you can do it better, please be my guest. Oh yeah, I'll show you how it's done. This is how you do pushups. You see that? Yeah, look at that. Ain't that something. You fat bastard. Give me that. You're a two-faced liar, Jürgen and I hate two-faced people. I'd smack you silly, but I don't know which face to slap first. I know you're angry at me, I deserve it. But Tony is really down and it's all my fault. Somehow that doesn't surprise me. Come on, I'll make it worth your while. I'm an honest woman now. I'm married. What? You got f**** married? What a waste. I guess half the sailors in Hamburg must be on antidepressants now. You've always been a liar, a cheat and a scoundrel, but you're still a charmer. Eva, I warned you not to hire over. Oh my god even when I hear the word over, it makes my skin crawl. I could just wipe it. Jürgen, meet my left hand, Phoebe Tension. The name speaks for itself. Meow. You must be a computer whiz. You just turned my hardware to software. Pity, but you would have liked that Kelly. So please would you do something about the mongrel behind the bar. Otherwise I need to call the S.W.A.T. team to swipe away his remains from the sidewalk. Phoebe. Eve, wait, we're just getting comfortable here, right? Save your breath Jürgen, you'll need it to blow up your next date. What about Tony? Come on give me something here. "La Cage", which role? Zaza. Tony in drag? He'll kill me. Tell him to get in line. It's an amazing part and I need a great singer. I think he could do it. Besides, George has already been cast. You know you're quite lucky I lost my "Zaza" this morning. I can't do drag. Me? I'd be the ugliest woman who ever lived. I know the ugliest woman who ever lived in the biblical sense. You're not even close. Come on. Get dressed. You're scary. Hey, forget it. It ain't going to happen. What the f*** is problem, Finelli? We need this gig. I ain't wearing no dress. Don't b***** me. It ain't the dress. You're f**** scared. I spent15 years in Moabit. I ain't scared of nothing. But a f**** dress. Let me tell you something, I don't have a lot of respect for almost no one. But I've always respected you. Don't take that away from me. Get in the dress and let's go. You know, I really need a job, but this ain't gonna happen. I mean, what are people going to think? No f**** way. If you bail, I quit. You're gonna quit because of a stupid dress? No. I'm gonna quit over a stupid you. I mean all those years, you faced everything. The German CIA, Tina, Mr. Big, your family, your Kids, and you never back down, not once. I ain't gonna let you start that shit now. Jorge, darling, start again. Try not to move your hip so much. You're not a drag queen. I've waited 60 years to do drag, Eva. Don't ruin my fun now. A little glitter never hurt anybody's career. Just ask Cher. Got me a fur, it's cold. Let's go. Stop walking so fast. These shoes are killing my feet. Okay, wait, I got to get into character now. You know why? You don't even know what the f*** you're talking about. Hey dude, you got a problem? Hey. That guy just grabbed my ass. Tony wait. That guy grabbed my butt. I know, I know. Just calm down man. Keep your eyes on the fucking prize. We're gonna do this. Come on, it's here. Just get in. They call me Cuba Pete. I'm the king of the rumba beat. You're a vision. Oh my. What an amazing outfit. You think I could borrow it some time? Sure. Why not? Wow. You're very tall. I'm a big girl now. What were you before? You're funny. Jürgen, you didn't tell me he's so funny. Oh! I'm so rude. This is my husband, Jorge. Jorge, this is Jürgen and Tony Finelli or should I say The Lady Chablis? So you're the guy who made an honest woman out of Eva? I'm Cuban, not a miracle worker. Tony Finelli? Do you happen to know a Pete Finelli? Yeah, that's my father. That's amazing. What a coincidence. Your dad and I were in the army together. Really? Yeah, we were stationed in Wiesbaden. I haven't seen him in nearly 50 years. Yeah well he lives here in Berlin with my mother. Surprise. Surprise. Excuse me, I got to take this call. Be back in a minute. You've gotta give me his phone number. I'm gonna give him a call. Yeah, sure. But you know just between you and me, before you contact him, maybe want to go easy on the glitter eye shadow. That's like the pot calling the kettle black, don't you think? Yeah, that's right. Tony, your parents always come up in your stories. We are very close. I mean they live with me. Actually now that I think about it, maybe I am a masochist. How did your parents react to you having to go to prison? Did they visit you? I think if my mother could have figured out how to put a file inside a meatball, I would have been out of prison a lot sooner. You know, growing up, my parents were very, very strict. I had to be home at 11. I had chores, I had curfew, you know, the whole nine yards. Actually, when I think about it, being in prison was not all that different than my childhood, except maybe for the showers. I always thought my parents were very conservative people. But you know they surprised me how open-minded and tolerant they could be. Jorge, come on in Pete, good to see you. Bea will be out in a moment. Okay. Whoa. You're like nine feet tall. Funny, Tony asked me the same thing. Like father, like son. Let me take that. Step right in the parlor there. This is Bea's mother. The kids call her Nonna. Mio piacere, Nonna. Where you going, Ma? Sto scappando prima che il nano e il gigante provino a mangiarmi. Good to see you, Pete. It's been nearly 50 years. Jorge, I'm so sorry. I'm a little late. Great to see you. You look wonderful. Thank you, and you're handsome as ever. Wow. Hello Bea. I'm Eva. Nice to meet you. What the f*** is wrong with you man? Okay, I never meant anything, one like him/her/it, whatever, you know. That's my friend Eva. It is a SHE, you stupid f***. She's not only super beautiful, she's also a super top professional. That's Ricky Ricardo, her husband, I guess. Babaloo. Anyway, get your f**** act together, and get this f**** job. Don't you embarrass me. Sorry man. Yeah, yeah. Here she comes. Tony, are you ready? Yeah. What a question, He's just ever ready. Right Tony? Eva, is your cell guy here, because I want to give him Tony's tracks. I know you can sing, Tony. Everybody knows you can sing. Now, show me you can play the part. Play the track please. I know who I am. I'm not your... Stop. I don't believe you. What are you? I man, you're singing "I am what I am" but what are you? Well I could say the same to you. What's wrong, Tony? Everything. Everything. I, I'm here but I, I uh, I don't recognize myself. I don't know how to relate to this. When I was little, I used to look in the mirror every day. I stood there for hours, because I didn't recognize the person who I saw. In my mind, in my heart and in my soul, I was someone who was completely different. That's what Zaza feels as well. I think, I think my corset is way too tight. I gotta pee. Where's the bathroom? In the hall to the left. Need any help? No, no. I'm good. I'm good. Thanks. I'll get it. Do you think you learned anything from all those years in prison? When you are sitting in a little cell there is nowhere to run. I've been running my whole life. I think performers, we're all running. You know, we run away from ourselves, we run to bury ourselves in some character. Tony Finelli, becoming a philosopher. Who would have thunk? Just goes to show, you wait long enough, miracles happen. But when you're in prison, there is nobody there but you. So you better like yourself. You better make friends with who you are, cause if you don't you ain't long for this world. When I first met Eva, something inside of me "clicked." I had never met a woman like her. Me, neither. The next day, I went home and I told the kids, then I asked Manuela for a divorce. You know Pete, we build our own prisons. When I saw how Eva have freed herself, I knew I had to change my life. And your wife, your kids? Did that seem like prison to you? Pete, we don't pick who we love. We just love. At first, it was tough with the kids, but at the end of the day, they see that I am happy, and the kinds want me to be happy. For Manuela it was tough. We had been married over 40 years. Now we see each other with the kids. Time really heals all wounds Pete. Except that one. I'd like to give that Vampire a garlic enema. So, let me get this straight. You married to a German woman, you had kids, you got divorced. You were born with a boy's body, and now you are the most, most, most woman I have ever seen. This is just like an episode of Oprah. I'm so happy you're here. Have some more cheesecake? No, no, no, no, no. Honey, if I have another piece, my Spanx will need Spanx. Nonsense, my angel, you are a goddess. Thank you for your hospitality. You are lovely. So are you, dear. I hope we do this again. Pete, I would really love to have you and Be as my guests in the theater. Can I invite you to opening night? We'll have to see. It's a bit difficult with Nonna. It's like having a puppy, except every time I bring her to the pound, they keep shipping her back to us. He just loves to joke. We'd love to come. Can I wear something sparkly? I insist. And if you need anything, just let me know. You can lend something of mine. Okay. Pete, it was so lovely to meet you. Tony is an awful lot like you. Like father, like son, always smiling. I was really embarrassed walking over here dressed like this. Actually I wanted to die. Why? You wore costumes before. Yes, but I am so ugly as a woman. We do wonders with wigs and makeup, believe me. Did you get beat up a lot? There are many ways to hurt a person, that don't just involve hitting them. I probably know them all. At the end of the day, being me was more important than anything anyone else could say or do. Can I ask you a question? You just did. Don't be a wise guy, girl. I'm trying to be serious here. What's your question? Was it worth it? Are you happy? Like everybody, I mean I have my good days and my bad days, but yes, I am happy. And, before you ask, yes, I would do it again. You would? I used to stand hour after hour in front of the mirror. I began to project an image of how I wanted to look one day. Back then, it just seemed like a far off dream. But I held on to that dream, day after day, year after year, operation after operation until one morning, I woke up. I looked in the mirror and I finally saw me, the way I had always dreamed I should be. I know all about holding on to a dream. I spent 15 years in prison. And every day, I dreamed about what my life would be like when I finally got out. And now here I am. I just somehow didn't imagine it in this dress. But pink is such a good color for you. You think? I think it makes me look a bit "hippy." Don't get me started. I'm just a big hearted girl with hips to match. Who would have thunk we got so much in common? Can I, can I give you a hug? If you like. Jeez, you're like Dolly Parton. I mean, how do you stand up with those things? I like to call them Mary Kate and Ashley. These "girls" have brought me really far. Are you ready to sing, now? I don't know. I feel like the Hindenburg in pink sequins. You know if I get this part, I think I need to lose a little bit of weight. Somewhere, deep down inside of me is a very thin person waiting to break free. Really? Only one? Ha. Ha. Ha. Play the track. One second, one second. Listen, I'm really sorry for the way I behaved. Sometime I'm an idiot. Don't be sorry. Be brilliant. Hi Buddy, what's your name again? Nice eye shadow, by the way. Jorge Alberto Gutierréz. D***, not just Jorge? You gotta give me all three names? What are you, Spanish? Do you want some Vodka? No, I'm a rum kind of man. I know who I am. I'm not your shy, meek, entertainment. See, my song is loud. Come and sing along. Don't be complacent. Yes my life, though I'm witty I still have my problems. In my life, it's enough if I begin, I begin to solve them. Cheers man. Come ring the alarm. He's really good. Use all your charm. Listen, you can't stop this man. I know who I am and when I look and I see a winner. When they start to look at me. Some say I'm fat. I know I'm thinner. Yes my life's full of highest high and deeper sorrows. Live now because... It's a shame, really. What the f*** are you talking about? The part is already cast. Eva found some German TV star to do it just this morning. You'll never stop me because I know just who I am. F***, f***, f***. Your manager has the foulest mouth in show business. Why is his favorite expression is the f-bomb? You know what my mother always says? Love me. Love my dog. What can I tell you? I wanted a Rottweiler for a manager. Instead I get a "Shit*-zu" with potty mouth. Daddy, can you please ask Jürgen not to swear so much. I met him at the Drug Store. He was cursing at the pharmacist. It was really embarrassing. Hey I was just f**** talking. There was no problem at all. You know I told you, you got to clean up your act. Cursing is the crutch of the intellectually challenged. See? You know why I curse, right? Because I f**** want to. Because I f**** can and because I don't give a f***. Come on. And THIS is what represents you to the world. No wonder you're still working as our Super. Hey wait up, Genius Girl. I need your help. Oh, looking to expand your vocabulary? No, I'm trying to convince your father to get a freaking makeover. Tell him he looks like the morning after the freaking night before. Maybe our cunning linguist is on to something, Daddy. Whoa, cunning linguist, holy s***. The last time I heard that, it meant something totally different. Hey, get your mind out of the gutter. It was a joke. Hey, there are 2 million chicks outside. This coop is off-limits. I'm not joking. Two hits, I hit you, you hit the floor, E basta... Don't worry Daddy. I never date Senior Citizens. Ouch. That hurt. By the way, Dad, maybe you could "update" your look a little. You think? It's a bit like "Married with Children". Tony, did you miss me? Yeah, you keep ducking when I throw the knives. You know, I was very naive when I married you. And I was very high. Every door was open for me. That's because people are happy to see you leave. Tony, why are you trying to play a comedian? Well, the part of blood-sucking ice queen was already taken by you. How many times do I have to flush before you're gone? You're lucky ugly ain't a felony, otherwise you'd be in for life. Lola is very upset with you. What did you do? I kind of lost it when I saw her kissing that guy. You keep this up, you'll lose more than that, [Foreign Language]. Huh? I'll make sure you are singing soprano for the rest of your life, jailbird. Just stay away from Lola and Lena. You destroy everything you touch. I'm just trying to be their father. That's like a shark trying to be a vegetarian. You're the only man eater here. Tony, you are a special kind of stupid. If they give prizes for dumb, you'd have an Oscar. Oh, you're very funny. Let me... D***. Man, if I could just harness all that energy between the two of you, I could light up Germany. Probably the planet. She really hates me. Love and hate are two sides of the same coin. Since when did you become a philosopher? I had a lot of f**** time in the joint. I was watching that Dr. Phil a lot. He's actually a pretty smart guy. Anyway, come on, we gotta go. Wait a minute. I didn't have shower yet. You don't need to, I'm bringing you to Helga. Helga? You must be ze fat boy. Nice to meet you, too. Tony, this is Helga Brennfeuer. She's an old friend of mine and I want her to be your personal trainer. What? You know Helga, after 15 years in Moabit, I told you, he's looking, you know, a little "rough around the edges." You gotta get him back in shape fast. You will have to pay me more. This is a big job. Hey, wait a minute. Helga you can do it. I know you can. Easier to deadlift a gorilla. Hey, come here. Don't tell me that this is one of your conquests. Oh my god. Long story. Lots of tequila. Hey, why aren't you cursing? She hates cursing. She told me she would kick my ass if I do. Tony I'm scared of her. I ain't afraid of her... Oh yeah, trust me, you didn't see her on the trapeze in her bedroom. Bam. I know Jürgen means well. And I really thank you for your time, but I don't need no personal trainer. No, you need a Body Transplant. Okay, Listen, Helmut. I don't know how many steroids you swallowed, but back in New York where I come from, chick don't talk to guys like that. Put on the gloves. I ain't boxing with no a girl/thing. Put on the gloves and step into the ring. If you win, you're free. If I win, we train. You don't want to box with me. I used to be a boxer. You used to be a man, too. But now, you are just jello. Deal or no deal? Give me those gloves. Come on. It's Tony "The Tiger" Finelli battling Helga "The Hun" Brennfeuer. Ladies and Gentlemen, fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night. These two titans of the ring going mano a mano. Come on fatso Finelli. I ain't fat. I got big bones. So does a whale. Get up Daddy. Come on Daddy. Wake up, come on Daddy, get up. Why, what is it? You fell asleep. I fell asleep, I know. I'm kind of knocked out. Get up. Come on big boy. Who are you? Are you ready to work now? Deal's a deal. Go, go, go, faster. Go Finelli, go. What are you doing? Do you want to want to lose weight? Would you stop blowing that thing. Go, go, go, go. Ow. Again, go, go, go. Are you a man? Come on, fight Finelli, fight. Hey. Dad, can I come in? Yeah, wait a minute. I'll be right with you. Yeah, one second. Yeah. Hi honey. Come in. I wanted to apologize. Oh no, no. Sweetie you don't need to apologize. I need to apologize. Come here, sit down. I have to interrupt you. You said something earlier on in the interview. You said, "I can't forgive myself because my daughter Lena grew up without a father." Tony, the world has forgiven you. You're back on top again. How important is forgiveness for you? Do you think you'll ever be able to forgive yourself? I don't know. You know, I was thinking about everything you said was right. You're a grown woman and you have to live your life. It's just that, sometimes, when I look at you, I still see you like my Christmas Present. What do you mean? Your first Christmas, I come home after a concert, and you mother had lit the Christmas tree. She put you in this beautiful blue dress. You almost had no hair, but then you had a bow in your hair. And she set you in this silver hat box underneath the tree. You were the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. You and your sister are the greatest presents I could have ever been given. I didn't know that story. No, how could you? That was just something between your mom and me. I don't think I ever loved your mother more than on that day. You used to love each other a lot, didn't you? I can't speak for her, but yeah. I loved your mom a lot. And we both love you and Lena more than anything. By the way, you were right about Helmut. What did he do? I'll kill him. No, nothing like that. He just decided I needed bigger boobs or whatever. What? Come on Lola, honey, look at you? You're beautiful. You are perfect exactly the way you are, exactly. If some guy wants you to change for him, change the guy. Actually, we have to go. Jürgen called. We have to be downtown in like 10 minutes. Okay. You go ahead, I'll be right up. I got to put my shoes on. Well, you're supposed to be best. So what do you f**** think?? It's impossible. You can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear. Did he just call me a sow? Technically not, but he did refer to you as the auditory receptacle of a female pig Oh My God. Einstein, do you have any sense of humor? It was just a saying. You look fabulous, darling. Who's your stylist? My mom helps me out a lot. That b****. I hate her. Join the club. and Daddy stop it. Ingy, we've got to update Tony's look. So do do that voodoo..." That you do so well. It's so frustrating. All the good ones play for the wrong team. and We know. I hate shopping. That's your problem, Mr. F. Ooh, F, I like that. But I guess that's obvious. I use the "F" word a lot. We know. Actually, I love ex-cons. So "Prison Break." You got the wrong f**** hardware. Sorry man. Hardware. Are you trying to tell me something? So many things come to my wicked little mind. Here's the proof. God gave men a brain and a penis, but only enough blood for one of them to function at a time. You are a verbal virtuoso. Lola I'm shocked. A word with four syllables and alliteration. A litter of what? No, no, no. We've got to make you attractive to a modern audience, Tony. Perhaps a paper bag? Just kidding. Come with me dear, and welcome to the 21st century. You go with these first dear. Oh my god. When did that happen? No, no, no, no. Jürgen no. This is not me. Well of course not dear. This has style, you have none. And if you don't knock it off, you ain't going to have no teeth. Please ask King Kong to calm down, Jürgen. I'm just trying to help. Listen, I'm 53 years old. I'm not 35. All this crap is MTTBB. What's that? Men trying to be boys. You know. Penis Car. Fake Tan, 25 year old girlfriend. I don't want to be 25 again. Been there. Done that. You, Ding Dong. Ingolf. Get me something you know, a little fancy but not, hey that one. Get me that. I want that one. Jürgen, girls, pack up, let's get out of here. I had enough. Remember what you said back to me at home? What? You're perfect just the way you are. Yeah? Well same goes for you Daddy? You're sweet. You, get dressed, let's go. Your new show is called "Love Will Never Die". Love seems to be a re-occurring theme in your music, in your stage performances, even when you're on television. Define for me, no, for our viewers, what does love mean to you? Well my mother always says, food is love. I guess you could say I've always had too much love --- at least at the dinner table. The rest of my life, not so much. What, how do you define love? That's a tough one. Go, let's take everything to the table. The food is getting cold. Come on. Bella. Attenzione. Come on, Nonna. You don't have time for Grandma now that you're big? Lola, when are you going to tell me about your boyfriend? I don't have a boyfriend, Grandma. No boyfriend. When I was your age, let me tell you, oh, do you play for the other team? Bea, stop it. Sorry, Lola. You're grandma's been watching too much Ellen Degenerate. De Generes. I try to be modern and this is the thanks I get. There's problem, Grandma. I just haven't met the right guy yet. But when I do, you'll meet him. And you'll bring him over and I'll cook. Ow. What the f*** is wrong with you? Nothing. I'm sorry. I'll take it easy on you the rest of the f**** night, okay. Come on. You say f*** a lot. I don't just say it. Hi Tina. What is it this time, Jürgen -- another, uh, Daughter? Aunt? Cousin? Hi, I'm Marie, his, uh, what was that again? Niece. Yeah, niece. Nice. A brain surgeon as well. What does Grandma always say? "Food is love." What's that funny smell? Nonna. What's that smell? Nonna. Stop it Pete. Lena, honey, that's garlic. We're Italian. Food without garlic is like a day without sunshine. Or gas. Oops. I shoot. Tesoro mio. Che bello. Come ti chiami. What did she say? She don't remember your name. She don't remember my name. Yesterday, she tried to chase me out of the apartment. She thought I was the mailman, again. Lower the boom, there we go. Really, I hear you knocking but no one's home. Stop that Pete, that's my mother. Come on Tony, come help me. Yes mom. What a mess you made outside, Tony. I think they knocked you on your head when you were born. Ma. Stop with him, Pete. He's an artist, he's not a handyman. Why do you always defend him? Why are you yelling? Because I only got 2 gears, "The Godfather" and "Loud." Stop yelling at your father. Now come on. I'm not yelling, my voice projects, and you should talk. You know we're banned from Swarovski Stores worldwide, because your voice exploded an entire display cabinet. I am very resonant. You know you get your voice from me. I think I got hearing damage from you. And I got agita from you. I'm getting a headache. Huh? Come on guys, can't you just all get the f*** along? Who asked you? Butana. Okay everybody, shut the f*** up. Jürgen is in the house. And this is, uh, Marie. Your mouth is like a toilet. Why don't you put your tongue in it and flush it. Ma, what are you doing? He's the reason you went to prison. How can you be so stupid? Don't call him stupid. That's my job. It ain't so simple. You guys don't know everything. That's what I'm trying to f**** tell you, Bea. Are you cursing at my wife? No f**** way. Are you cursing at me? Disgraziato. Get outta my house. Che bellissima. O Dio. Salvatemi!! Vedo molti angeli. Oh my God. It's Grandma. Grandma, grandma. Ma. Don't look at the angels. Stay with me. Please, don't die Nonna. You can fart on me all you want. Maybe you're not made of ice after all. Nonna, I'm sorry for losing my temper, for thinking you're playing hockey with a warped puck. Well, basically, for just about everything. Pete. What? If she kicks off, I don't want her to say bad things to the guy upstairs. I might need some help, when it's my turn. Move please, move. What are you doing? Move. Who is this person and what is she doing? I'm a registered nurse. Signora, mi sente? Signora? Le mi sente? Va tutto bene? Kiss my f**** ass. You speak Italian? Grandma. I'm not as dumb as I look. The nurse didn't look like that the last time I was at the doctor. She sure raised my g***** temperature last night. Oh. Oh. My god. Oh Jeez. Something crawled up inside her and died. Nonna come on, I'll help you up. I'll help you. Voi Pazzi. Non lottare. I don't like it when you fight. Yeah, yeah grandma. No worries, come on. Let's get you up. Come on grandma. Jeez, what a stink. That's unbelievable. Jürgen, shall we bury the hatchet? Really, of course, Pete. Apology accepted, Finelli Style. Dad are you nuts? Jürgen, wait a minute. Stop. Not my hair. No, not my food. Not my food. I love that. There you go. You know what, now I'm hungry. Let's eat. Let's eat. Well I cooked. What an extraordinary life. I mean what an amazing story. And you really look the part. It's always a pleasure to talk with you. And thank you for taking time to talk to us before your big opening night. There's just one more question that I have before I leave. Tony, we've all read about your divorce and all the turmoil in your personal life. Tony the singer is having and all-time career high. But, what about Tony, the man? Is there a happy ending for him as well? Is there someone special in your life you'd like to tell us all about? That's very cheeky. I ought to bite your neck for that question. Of course, I can't answer that. Barbara, you know you and I, we got a very special relationship and I share a lot with you, but, as stupid as this is going to sound, I like to keep my private life private. Jürgen, would you leave us alone? I want to talk to Tony. You, sit. Lola wants you're here, otherwise I never would have ever laid eyes on you again. Lola loves me. I love her. I love Lena. That's why I'm here. They kept me going. I thought of them every single day. Such a great Daddy you are. You really hate me, don't you? Being married to you was like a 3 ring circus. Engagement Ring, Wedding Ring and Suffering. You're Russian. You should be used to that. I did what I had to do. What you had to do was to protect me and the girls. Instead, you became the "Prisoner of Alcatraz." I did what I had to do. So did I. Now let's get back to business. You can have the Super's job but I can only pay you what I paid the last guy. That's all I can afford. Come on. Look around you. Look at this place. Who paid for all of this? Who paid for these? I mean those things come with a guarantee. I told you, I did what I had to do. I have a sponsor who donated these. He must not know you. Certainly, I was getting nothing from you. But I got something from you. Took me 3 rounds of penicillin to get rid of it. Are you insinuating? Tony, I've seen your little black book. And I've seen your little black book. It's a size of a freaking encyclopedia. I mean they had to build a wing on the Library of Congress just to put that in there. Haven't you hurt us enough? I don't want to hurt you. I would never hurt the girls. Coulda, woulda, shoulda, but you did. The old fire is still there. Shop's Closed, Tony. Forever. No. I'm not so sure. See, I'm still the same man I used to be. The one you fell in love with all those years ago. You liked it and you know it. You're a dreamer, Tony. Give it up. It's over. You're over. You ruined everything for me, for you, for all of us. No one wants to hear a 53 year old, overweight, washed up, convicted felon sing. You're just kidding yourself. It's all I have left. I lost you. I lost the kids. I lost my name, my money, my reputation. I lost everything. All I got is that dream. And if I give up on that, I might as well be dead. That can be arranged. Bite me would you. Bite me? That's the best you can do? Oh, grow up, Tony. Just finally grow up. You're nothing. You're no one. You're nothing. You're no one. Tony, I know this is really f**** small. But this is all I was able to get on short notice. We got to start somewhere, right? Yeah, you're right. I rehearsed the band this afternoon. They're ready for you man. Okay. Go get them. Good evening Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a very special guest tonight. He hasn't been onstage in 15 years, but now he's back. So please, welcome Mr. Tony Finelli. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's been a really long time. It's nice to be back, and thank you all for coming. I wrote a new song just for tonight. It's called "Here I Am Again." I hope you like it. Okay, hit it boys. You're nothing, you're no one. That's all I ever heard. I wondered will it ever change? Running in circles, year after year. No exit, but who was to blame? I looked in the mirror, fingers point at me. The dawn's come time to change this game. And not it's time I say to you that here I am. The same man that I used to be. I've had my escape you see. Now that's let me pay. Here I am. The same man that I used to be. Now everything has changed for me. Yes, I paid the price I had to pay, but finally found my way. I am here to stay forever. I was down but I stood up today. My fears are locked away. So listen when I say, here I am. The same man that I used to be. I found my escape you see and I have set me free. Here I am. The same man that I used to be. Now everything has changed for me. Yes, here, here I am again. Yes, here I am again. Here I am again. It's how it should be. I won't say goodbye. I will take your hand. You'll be in my arms. Love will never die. You're the one for me. There's a purpose in my step. There's a power in my hands. I've known my share of fear and doubt, but wouldn't change my plans. Never looked to where you're turn my back. I never cut and ran. I stood my ground and fought. Nearly 25 years after he shocked the entertainment world, with his unexpected arrest. When it comes to making bad decisions, I've always been first in line. With his unexpected arrest, the voice from New York is back. I got a Doctorate in bad decisions. That's better, huh? He had an amazing singing career, gone in the blink of an eye. We will be talking about that and much more. Wait a minute. I got a gold medal in stupidity. That's the best one, don't you think? Cut. Why? Come on. The love of your life gone in a second, your own flesh and blood. You left your two young daughters all alone for 15 years. Your money, your career, your reputation all gone. What can I say? When it comes to stupid decisions, I got an Oscar. But you reached for the impossible, and now you're back on top again. Tell us, how did you do it? Maybe some of them stupid decisions wasn't so stupid after all? And now you have a blockbuster movie. What is it all about? What movie? What are you talking about? Jürgen? Did we make a movie? Tony Finelli starring in "The Finellis" Movie. Like my father taught me how. For the giants all around me. Took the hits of what fall down. Come to think, you see me crying. If I do, you'll never know. No matter what, I keep on trying, I'm a man that's how it goes. I'm a man who walks in the darkness. Come a man who's high with mine. I tell you, nothing could ever stop me. I'm a man. I'm a man... Enough with the food throwing. [Indiscernible discussion] No hard feelings, come on. Come on. I'm a man. I'm a man.
