Shao-lian Can you hear it? The pretty music? I hear it. "Chuen-sheng discharged - coming home today" Hello? It's me. I'm caught in traffic. I'll try to hurry. Yes... as fast as I can. See you soon. Is it a crime to change lanes? - No! I'm just... - You're just what? Hey! You're the one who crashed into me! Well, you didn't bother... to turn on your signal! What a mess! Leave it alone! Gimme a break, lady! Why you beastly little...! Be reasonable! First you hit my car, and then you're rude! Is Chuen-sheng here? Not yet. He must be celebrating with friends. Let him. I don't care. Don't! He can do it himself. I'll just tidy up his bed. You've spoiled him rotten. What? A snake! Don't be afraid. He's a god's foot soldier. He won't hurt you. Don't worry. He's only passing through. A snake? He'll make us rich! What's the zodiac number? Six. Of course. So it'd be zero and what? Zero and six, dummy! Let's read the fortune! Okay. But not here. Ah-chiuan, Ah-tion! Here! I know. Clean this stuff up. Watch out for the snake! Chuen-sheng will stay with me... in your old room. It's too cramped here. He should be grateful just to have a bed. So... you're finally home. You're drunk. Friends took me out. Just as Ah-fen thought. She was just here. You coming right back right after she left. What's wrong? Too small? Or you hate being with a geezer? Then go to your sister's. See if I care. I'm fine here. You don't have to lie. Don't want her to take care of you? Or are you afraid of her? Burn incense for your ma and tell her you're home. You'd better go to Ah-fen's. We'd just butt heads if you stay. You're out of the army. Now you have to get a real job. That damn horn of yours! It's totally useless for making a living. Damn good-for-nothing! The number you have dialed is not in service Pick a card! Remember it. Room 707. Take it easy on me! Who's being hard? C'mon! One more! Drink up! So junior here plays the horn? Yeah... they say. Really? Great! At a funeral, you gotta play a dirge, man. That's your job. I'm through finding you work! No telling what you'll do. The valves on this leak. Can you fix it? Nice horn. No problem. I'll fix it. How much for a new one? Well... A hand-made one goes for NT$150.000 or so. We got a good one. Want to see? He likes to show his treasures off. Better not look. It'll tempt you. Think how many dirges we'd have to play to buy it. It drives me nuts! It's got a great tone. My oh my! Such a naughty boy! I smell like whisky, don't I? Return the key for me. I'll buy some cigarettes and meet you. I'll wait downstairs. Come right back, okay? That's enough. Let go. Hello. Hello? The cell phone you have is mine. Don't hang up! Hello? Yes, I want you to return it. You told callers what!? That I moved to Vancouver? You've got nerve! Ah-hai? Oh, it's you. I thought Ah-hai had come back. Ah-hai? Who's he? How old is he? About 30, I guess. Looks older though. Used to be a laborer. A dump truck driver? I don't know. Did you fix it? I'm doing it now. Not up there. Just play down here. "Help wanted Salary: NT$200,000" I saw your ad in the paper. Thank you. Is this Mr. Yeh? Hello? Who is this? This snoring... I can't sleep, so I thought I'd call. Don't you listen to your messages? That's not true! I left three of them. Don't lie, or I'll tell people you're in Vancouver. Why not cancel your cell phone account? Your husband says he'll report me to the police. That's right... your husband. The phone belongs to your husband? We're not divorced yet. Never mind him. And don't say I'm in Vancouver. Yes. Yes. Just as we agreed. Why the divorce? Marriage isn't for me. I'm happier by myself. No, I don't. I don't need a lover. How dare you threaten me? I'll throw the phone away! Call if you want to talk. If he threatens me again I really will throw the phone away! Ah-fen... It's your brother. Are you there? I found a job. I'll work hard. Tell Dad not to worry. I'll get by. Ah-fen. I'll pay money down on a place for Chuen-sheng. He'll work if he has a loan to pay. It's no use. If he doesn't work we'll be left holding the bag again. Don't do it. It's wasting time. I pray to the Buddha. I pray for help every day. When all else fails it's best to leave it to the gods. Here. Have the rest. Hello. Is the manager in? You mean Mr. Liao? Yes. Do you have an appointment? Here's my card. And these are magazines we publish. I'm sure he'd like to see them. No salesmen. Finding work is a matter of luck. Of course talent helps, too. Has that guy Ah-hai been around? Not lately. He comes and goes without any warning. He does just what he likes. Ah-hai plays the sax like the wind. You don't see many horn players like him. He plays in the strip joint. Go ahead... take it out. No charge. Going home? Your dad's taking a nap. Take care of it. What? The cell phone. No need to cancel. But the bill... We'll get the phone back. Can you leave the car? It's got to be serviced. It'll take half a day. Okay. I'll drop you off and go from there. Dad! Is something wrong? You all right? Shao-ei woke me up. Come on in. Hey Shao-ei... you got something? What a downpour! The sky's split wide open. It's after five. Time to eat. I'll cook dinner... stay and have some. Good idea! Let's eat together for a change. All right. I'll cook it up quick. Ah-ching... Do you always cook from scratch like this? This is nothing. At work I cooked for 15 or 16 people. I love to eat. I don't get fat... I'm thin. Of course, I'm still young. What? You'll make a dress for me? Yeah. That's what you mean. Where do you live? That's really far. I may bring the phone over. Hope you don't regret it. Yeah. It's a promise. Who are you waiting for? So you do have a lover! No. It's my little brother. No, really! I'm like a mother to him. Our mom died young. No other kids. Just us two. Don't be crude. It's not funny. Sure I've been in love. Nothing much to say. Lie or be lied to. It's all the same. You don't mind being lied to? That's dumb. Not for me, thanks. Sure, I've been fooled. But that's over. You fighting with someone? I'll call back! What the hell!? Why'd you hit me on the head? You scared me with that lit cigarette! Can't you take a joke? I was on the phone! Those look heavy. Want some help? The cheapest room. No TV? Not in these rooms. You want it? Are they different? Only by 5 mm. Don't say "only". If the waist is 5 mm off, the dress is ruined. The focus of a woman's body is here. And the curve here from back to front. You need to learn that. See for yourself. Look at yourself naked in the mirror. What's so funny? Look at your body lines... do some research. Ah-bel? Chuen-sheng. Any work? No funerals because of the weather? I don't like rainy days. It's freezing. Let me know if there's work. I'll call back later. Bye. Ah-fen... I found a job. I'll work hard. Tell Dad not to worry. I'll get by. Ah-fen... Don't bother looking. NT$4,800 for the room. NT$800 a day for six days. Here's NT$5,000. Give me change. Don't worry. He'll come home soon. He's got no money, no clothes. Your change. Thank you. Don't look so angry. Ah-fen! Your brother's back! Ah-fen. We've been worried. Where've you been? Chuen-sheng... Regular soap'll give you a rash. Better use the baby soap. I know. But regular soap never bothered me in the army. Just do as you're told. You said you found a job... was it in sales? Did it last? How long? Just one day. Any work after that? Nothing much. Judging from these receipts... You lived in East Ward. Is that right? Just don't tell Dad. You think I would? I've always covered for you. When you pinched money from Granny. Or when you traded those stolen eggs for comics... Would I betray you now? I'll lay your clothes out. We're going to see Dad. Think about what you'll say. Look at these! They're your IOU's. What you gonna do? Answer me! What will you do? What if you were a father... with such a no-good son? Stay here. Settle down and find a job. Dreams don't put food on the table. Yeah, you're right, Dad. But if I'd gone to high school... and made it to college... there'd be no problem. And who wouldn't let me go? Chuen-sheng! Stop it! It was you, Dad! So you resent me... for not sending you to school? Dad... don't get angry! I know, I know. Chuen-sheng. This is final. Listen now. I'll give you one lump sum. You can set yourself up. From now on you're on your own. Why did your feelings change? All of your words were lies You cheated and I was a fool My heart is broken in two... I can't keep up with you. Are you a musician? Yeah, sort of. Mostly sax, but trumpet, too. Really? I'm a good singer, eh? In fact... I want to go professional. A teen idol... I can see it now. Don't laugh, I'm serious! Just imagine me on stage before thousands of fans... All eyes on me... and wild applause. How good it would feel. Keep your clothes on. Why? It's still early. Let's go out. It's your choice. Maybe they're asleep. What? Go through the window. Come in. There it is. Where? In here. No good. It's locked. It won't open. What shall we do? Do it some other time. We have no other time. Show it to me now! How? Think of something. Okay. You keep watch. Hello? Not now - I'm busy! I'll call back later. Bye. Go to the door. Cough if someone comes. The number you have dialed is not within range. A little lower. To the right. No, the left. My sister used to scratch my back. Your sister? Like this? Keep going. It's no good. The itching just gets worse. It'll stop soon. Your sister did this for you... It must have felt great Let me scratch your back now. No. Why not? Let me do it like your sister. Stop it! Well, you don't have to get so mad. Mai-Li... My sister and I were once sort of like this... like lovers. Your son comes and my wife goes. Good things never last. Speak of the devil. Dad, I need to talk. Go ahead. Talk. Ah-ching's no stranger. It's personal... So talk. It's this. I bought it really cheap from a friend. I want to pay it all now. How much? NT$60,000. What?! That much for a lousy brass tube? It's hand-made. It'd cost five times that new. He's your friend, right? Pay in installments. He needs money, too. Hey, Ah-ching! Guess how much. It's a fine one. Much better than Ah-hai's. It's hand-made. It's NT$60,000! That's about right. Please? Just NT$60,000. It's me. Mai-li. What have you been up to? I couldn't reach you. Yes. My brother came home. I'm really happy. Why'd you hang up? Another fight? No, really? What's he like? You pulled a heist on your first date? You're a scary girl. I egged him on. You're right... I'm no good. We just did it... It wasn't planned. But listen to this... about him and his sister. When he was small, she seduced him. They slept together. I'm not kidding. That's a scary girl! I guess so. But you're too easy... looking for thrills. You're not serious. Mine was pure and innocent. The first time was true love. I was in a cold sweat just holding hands But there was another feeling, too... Once. Yes... just one time. The night we eloped. We drove off in a truck... and kept on driving. All the way to the beach. Yes. And in the truck we saw the moonlight. And heard the waves. He was so gentle that night. The sea breeze so cool... His gentleness put me at ease. It was incredible... His body was so hot... Don't even bother. Chuen-sheng isn't there. He fooled me again. I'll call again. This is Ah-hai. Hello? Harder! The more it hurts, the more it helps. I'm going home, Dad. Harder! Relax. Remember what we talked about. Dad... Dad... This is my father and sister. Nice to meet you. I'm Mai-li. "Beautiful" and "lovely". What'd she say? -Her name characters. - Oh, I see. How old are you? How old? I'm twenty. Twenty. Oh. Still young. Where are you from? Puli. Oh... Puli. How many brothers and sisters? Ask her. Ask her what? About brothers or sisters. Any brothers or sisters? One older brother. One older brother. Oh, I see. She can't speak Taiwanese? No. Damn. Well, sit down. My sister wants to see me. You stay here with Dad. But we can't talk. Don't worry. I'll be right back. Alright. Sit down. Thank you. Leave it off. Turn it off. You want to marry? You have no job. She's so young. I want to marry her. It's too impulsive. Think about it. Don't you understand? You met just a few days ago. What's the rush? You'll regret it. No I won't. We already live together. Who pays the rent? I do. Of course you do. She doesn't work. She just lives off men. She won't do housework. So what? It's just us two. So you defend her. She's not the housewife type. She's shallow and flashy... Ah-fen... I'm going to marry her. I'm serious. You're not listening. What will you gain from marriage? Tell me. That's our business. So that's it, is it? What about me? You think I don't count? You don't come home... and when I finally see you you've got a fiance. You don't care about me! I had no warning. You just say, "I'm doing it, so stay out of it". That little girl has stolen my brother. That little hussy! What about you? You're no different. When you eloped with Ah-hai... How old were you? You lied to me. You said you were going to the movies. I was only eleven. Did you think of me? Why do you care now? Ah-fen. Don't cry. You're marrying her? The video records show she went from Tauchunang to Tainan and then back to Taipei. She was last seen in Hua-lien. Her present location is unknown. As long as she uses ATMs, we can keep track of her. Don't worry. She's withdrawn NT$3,000 every two days. Like clockwork. That's just like her. Except for the last four days. Look here... Nothing at all. I didn't notice. Hello? Oh, Chuen-sheng. No, no word. I put money in her account. Of course. She's my wife. Hold on. Chuen-sheng. Hello. Mai-li got a job? How about you? Hang tough - for your bride! Have you met her parents? We will when Ah-fen comes home and things are settled. It'd be too weird otherwise. Talk to you later, Dad. What's wrong? What is it? I've got a job interview to go to. Don't discourage me. Don't look so unhappy. Cheer up. I said cheer up! Let's take our wedding pictures. Who says I'll marry you? Who else would have you? I'll buy you a nice ring. Well? Feeling better? Time to get ready. Carry me. Go wait back there. Got plans tonight, Ah-hai? What a drag. What's wrong? Hi, Ah-fen. It's Mai-li. It's been a long time. I'm getting married. Bet you're surprised. Will you make my dress? I'll return your cell phone. Call me. This is definitely her purse. Are you sure? It should help you find her No wonder she quit using ATMs. It's a hotel in Cheng-kung. Look at these. They're all from Cheng-kung. What's she doing? Way down there? Let's go find out. Hello? Chuen-sheng? Hello? Get some sleep. It's a long drive. Are you cold? I'll turn it down.
