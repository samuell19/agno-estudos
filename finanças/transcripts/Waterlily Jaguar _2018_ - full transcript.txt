Please just get some... - Oh Bob. I wanted to say congratulations. Four months, New York Times best seller, that's, that's pretty impressive. Not to mention you made me the biggest agent in town. Cheers. - Thanks, Bill. - Uh huh. Oh, thank you. - Where's Helen? Oh, she's there. Looking ravishing, as always. I heard from Peter that she put this whole thing on, yeah? - Yeah, she did. - You good? Okay, well, I'll be around. Excuse me. - Miserable? - Oh god. - Follow me. Come to rescue me. Yes. I know how tough these things are for you. It's like an endless colonoscopy. It never ends. Oh, calm down. Turn around to some... It can't be that bad. Probe up my ass. Thank you. They love you. They love your book. Never seen them before in my life. - All right, look, I found you this nice quiet space. No one's in it. What's wrong? - Endless. - Huh? You just haven't seemed yourself for the past few weeks. - Well maybe it is who I really am. - I love you. I love you too. I love you. I love you. I love you. - I know. I'm sorry. - It's gonna be okay. - I'm just gonna sit here for a little while and enjoy this fantastic fucking art. - Bob, congratulations. Helen. Are you admiring my latest acquisition? - We are, yes. - Are you familiar with the artist? - I don't think so. - She was something years ago. She's dead now. Suicide, it's so sad. It's really too bad. She had a lot of potential. The model's dead too. I thought about having a retrospective, inviting people that knew her, but nobody's left. - All right, we'll be back. Thank you so much for letting us use your home for this party. He's in a moment. It's just a pretentious photograph. No, this person actually existed. I saw her. La Brea Tar Pit Museum. It was a hologram. Art. Well, kind of. It was near this big wooly mammoth. It was an ergonomic thing. It moved every 20 seconds or so and make this god awful noise. It was to scare the kids. You guys don't remember that? Yeah. And then all the bones would come and rearrange themselves and become this, this woman, this cave woman. It was kind of half cave woman, half I don't know, sex bomb. Really? It used to drive Mary mad. I thought it was quite sexy. And she'd say where's the real version? Where's the authentic version? Then she's had some sort of forensically accurate cave woman, whatever. - Yes? - It's me, Wil. - Finally. - Good morning. - Where were you last night? - My job is to assist you, not parade you around like some fat stuffed pink poodle. - Lovely imagery, as usual. - What do you want? - I need to find out about the La Brea Woman. - What? - Well, I was told that there's a hologram at the museum, or was a hologram at this museum, but they would animate it from bones into the body of this woman. Of course this is Bill is the source, so it could be just a load of crap. But had you been there last night, we would have had this conversation. You would now be bringing me the information. - Fuck you too. - Let's get to work. - All right. What museum? - It's the tar pit, the one with the hologram. Did you just hear what I just said to you? Are you listening? - When is it dated? - What? - How old is the fucking skeleton? - How the hell should I know? Cave woman times. When is that? - Did it occur to you to look this up? Shall we go have tea with her, or do you just want me to figure all this out myself? - You do it. Anyway, while you're doing that, I'd like you to also find out who did the artwork at the place I was at last night cause that's where I met her. - It's good to see you too, Bob. You know, I was afraid you'd fallen off one of those toothpick propped decks in the hills into the dark oblivion below the Hollywood sign. - Well, I have. Hmm. - And I've rolled all the way down the hill into the tar pit. And I'm at the very bottom. I'm now speaking to you through a special reed tube. - It's good to be at the bottom. It's better than the falling. - Yeah. Uh huh. Of course. Absolutely. Yeah, that's no problem at all. All right. Well, when? Just tell them that I'll be right out. I'm just finishing up an important call, okay. - You got it. - The ninth? Perfect. - So the bones are thought to be about 9,000 years old, native American. Maybe Chumash. The only human skeleton found there. Can you believe that? She was found in 1914. She had a fracture in her skull, which is probably what killed her. And the remains of a domesticated dog found next to her. Ritual sacrifice was ruled out, or they would have found more. To be quite honest, you could have found all of this out for yourself. - So? Tell me again. Why are we here and not at the tar pits? - I told you like three times. - I know, but I like the way you tell it. - Basically because they're douchebags. - Well? - Okay, I had a meeting set up and then they sent this 11th hour email saying that the board of the Tar Pits didn't thing that they would be portrayed well in your novel, and as such, they were passing. They're assholes, that's it. - Hmm. - You know, whoever murdered her dumped her in the tar pit. - Uh huh. The tar pit. Death suspended. You think your safe, but you're just rotting away from the inside. - Okay, stop talking, I'm not done. She lived probably here, historically speaking, the Chumash or the Tongva lived by flowing water, marshes everywhere, got around by canoe. She lived here. Do you get it? - So she was here, right beside this water. What was she doing? Bathing? Bob. - Is it the same water? I guess Heraclitus wouldn't think so. Bob. - Fragile hummingbird bones of beauty a little nest of broken bones. Lotus flower, waterlily jaguar. Hey Bob, you know you sound crazy, right? Bob? - I know what I'm gonna write. I know what I'm gonna write. This is the book. - Bob. - This is the book I'm going to write. Okay. I need everything that you might have come across, or seen, or encountered, where she went, what it looked like. What are the sounds? How did it smell? Yeah, this is the book I've always wanted to write. Finally some literature. Something that will come out of me. Yeah. All right, you can go now. - Oh god. Somebody called 911. - My god, Bob. - Helen. - I have calls in for the best doctors. This is no joke. This is serious. Everybody knows now. It has to stop, okay. You have got to stop drinking. It's destroying your health, okay. - Look. - Do you have any idea what could have happened? - Helen, please, this is idiotic. Jesus Christ, you're taking this way too seriously. - I'm not taking it too seriously. Bob, look at me. You could have died out there today. You could have died. - Well, I didn't die out there, okay. What I, what I need to do, what I need to do is get back to work. Come on, why don't you help me up. - No, no, come on Bob, please. Stop. You just have to rest, baby, okay. Just for a little bit, just give your body a break, okay. It's telling you you have to stop everything. - Bill? Price. I know. They won't let me drink anymore. They got me on some diet, exercise. It's outrageous. Well they want me to see a witch-doctor, a therapist for Christ's sake. I know, can you imagine. Say, listen, can you get Wilhelmina on the phone? Well she's not picking up. I don't know, I think they got her in on this too. It's some kind of intervention, I guess. When you talk to her, tell her I'm still working. Well I don't know, she'll figure it out. Yeah, yeah. At least I'm still alive, yes. - Hello. - Hi. Do you want to eat anything? - No. - Drink something? No. - Go outside? - No. - No? Just go outside and sit in the sun? - No, thank you. - I'm gonna get the pool heater fixed so that you can swim. - I don't think so. - I'm gonna do it. - Fine. - I'll swim for you. Energy through osmosis. Exercises through osmosis. Exercisical energy. Do you like that word, exercisical? I just made it up and you can use it in your next book. - Thank you. - If you'd like. - Sure. - I won't sue you or anything. - All right, good to know. - Hey. I'm gonna go out, so do you want anything? - No. - Nothing? - No. - Absolutely nothing? - Okay, now that you mention it, if you would, could you get me a bottle of scotch, a bag of potato chips, and a carton of cigarettes. Why are you even asking me that? What's the point? I don't see the point of anything anymore. - Hey. Just talk to me. Talk to me. You just need to get back to yourself. I just want you to be happy. Bob, tell me something. Waterlily Jaguar. Waterlily. What am I doing? What am I doing? - I don't know. I'm not sure what it is, this desperate drive to merge what makes a person look at someone, someone who they think can't live without, and then the next moment want to take a rock and bash their skull in and throw them in a tar pit. It's an impulse. It hasn't changed in thousands of years. Not much evolution in that department. - Have you been writing? Has he been writing? - Bob. - Uh huh. Peter was, was asking about the book. How's the bestseller? How's it going? Well, he's been writing a lot in verse. - Verse? - Yes. Verse? Interesting. - Verse. - Well not all of it is in verse. You gonna tell them? No. - Well what? What what? - What part's in verse? The book? - It's a little coming through slaughter. - His bright moment been and gone, sweetheart. Well, English Patient made millions. Made Minghella a director. - Yeah, dramatic piece of shit. - You should think about turning one of your novels into a screenplay. I don't know. - Is he still alive? - The writer? Oh yeah. Won awards. - Huh, whatever. Ask the average person, nobody would know his name. Maybe the film, but, but definitely not his verse. Kiss of death. - Well, Peter, come on, back off. Bob, think about it. Your book, major motion picture. Like Dan Brown. - That sounds like the kiss of death. - Hey. So who's ready for dessert? - What is it? - Heaven. - I'll have some of that. - Yeah, I'll have some. - Yeah, I'm gonna help you with that. - That was good. Yummy. - We need more wine. More wine. - All right, cheers. - Cheers. To verse. - So, tell me, is he actually writing in verse? - Yeah. - Is it any good? - Yeah. I think so. It's beautiful. - Beautiful. Yeah. - Wow. - He loves you. - I know. - Take your clothes off. I have to check something. - Check what? Some fucking verse or something? Something. - No work, remember. No work. Yeah. - Yeah, okay. So? Take your fucking clothes off. You're so gross. - Come on, you love it. Get 'em off. - Bob? Bob? Wake up. Hey, where're you going? - Park. Isn't that what you want me to do? I mean you want me to get exercise, right? Look, I know it's been hard. Come on, come with me. - No, I'm painting. I'm drawing. I got stuff to do, but have a good walk. Did books come in? - They did. And they're on your desk. Plus, I did find that museum in Mexico City you were asking about. - Museo de Antropologia? - Say it again. Say it again. One time, that's it. - Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Historia del Estado deo Mexico. Quesadilla. Corova. Taco. - Again. Then run away with me. - What about the other thing? - I looked into every prostitute in Los Angeles area and there was no one named Waterlily Jaguar. - You spoke to all of them. Every single one of them. - And their friends. - I did my due diligence. I assure you. I mean this could all be just the ramblings of a crazy man, right. - I don't know. It sounds like Black Dahlia. - That's super dark. I like to live in the happy place. - Yeah, it was dark. He's dark. - Speaking of happy places. Who drew these? - What? Oh, nobody. - Well, tell nobody these are quite good. That I am personally happy that nobody's drawing again. And with that, my lady, I bid you farewell. - So are these those real ones, or those claws? - Oh, it's to poke your eyes out. - They're like eagle's feet. - They're talons. - This is what will roll down my back. I have to get that. No, stop. - Would you just change your ringtone? - I'm not changing my ringtone. - Don't answer it. - No, stop, it's Bob. - Bob. - Wil? - Yeah. - How's it going with the viewing? - Impossible, like I told you. That sounds like an excuse. - Bob, quit acting like a five year old. There's a lot of bureaucracy involved here. It's not gonna be that easy to just get in there. I'm not expecting it to happen in a minute. But it's got to happen. - Did you hear what I just said? Do you understand? Make it happen. - Make it work. - That was quick. Okay. Come on. Let's go. Oh no, you're not leaving. - I have to work. - Well, you can work here. I'm gonna work here. Come on. I'll be here all day. Come on. No? - No, that's not what we do. Plus I promised Bob. - Oh yeah, you promised Bob everything would be this big secret. I'm not gonna say anything. You guys are like the boy scout club. Just tell me one thing. Tell me, I don't know, tell me how he writes. Does he write at a desk? Does he write standing up? He talks about you, you know. Yeah, we talk about you all the time. Tons of embarrassing stuff I know about you. Stuff that you wouldn't want anyone else to know. - Don't. - Come on. Why are you torturing yourself? - What the fuck are you talking about? - I love that dress. It's been a long time we've been hanging out with each other. You can talk to me. This is a safe place. You know me, I'm not gonna say anything. Come on, tell me one thing about you that I don't know. - Shove it. - Wil. Wil. It's what he calls you, right? Wil. Seven years. Seven years to the day you and I. I have something I want to tell you. - God, please don't. - No, no. I love you. I do. What's wrong with that? - That's not part of this, you're married. You have three kids. - I'm married with three kids, and I love you. What's, what's wrong about that? Stop it. - Wil, just get over it. Come on. Come back to bed, let's hang out. Wil. Please God. - Hello? Bob, it's me. So I have these two friends. - You sound like you're out of breath. Yeah. Yeah. So. - Yeah? So I have these two friends that work at the university. - So? They're getting their PhD's. I think they can get us to the bones. - Really? Completely illegal, but kind of possible. - Well that's great, Wil. No, there's one more thing. - What's that? This is so super none of my business, but Helen called me. She thinks you're having an affair. Bob? - Yeah. She wants to go to lunch. Did you hear what I just said? - I did. So, is there anything I should know or not know? - Yeah. Bob? So? - There is no other woman. I'm simply writing a story. I'm sorry that hurts her. Sometimes the work just takes over. Can you explain that to her? Could I just explain to her that you're full of shit? - Goodbye. - It's just he's writing in a way I've never seen before. That's all. - Why does it feel like this? I mean I've been with him when he's in writing mode many times. It never felt like this. - Those are just feelings, I guess. Why don't you write? - No, I'm not, I don't write. I paint. I've been painting. I just don't understand, I mean he won't see a psychotherapist, psychologist, psychiatrist, whatever. He won't take antidepressants, but he is depressed. I mean clinically, he has all the symptoms. And he's drinking, and I know it. He thinks I don't, but I see it. You must see it too. I mean the housekeeper tells me, friends call me and say they saw him, and they tell me. And maybe they're not my friends, but it's real. Something is wrong, deeply wrong. - So, we have the bones. Well, we always have them, obviously. That's all we do, bones. - This is not happening. - I really like your books. - Thank you. - Would you sign this one for me? - Of course. - Thank you. - What's your name? - Godfrey. - That's an unusual name. - We don't have time for this. Wil, did you explain? - I only agreed to this. - So, where'd you come from? - My parents actually... - Here we are. Everybody act normal. I don't give a shit about your name. - Okay, all right, yes, well. Anyway, here we are. Do you have a bag of laundry? - Yes, it's over here. Do it quick. - Okay. - Please do not touch. But if you must. - All right, we will be right outside. - Yeah, we need to get another load, and we'll be back. Get it? - You know, the other one is wrong. I like to hear about names, where they came from, and their histories. - Seriously? - Forget it, I don't need this. Anyway, I almost wrote a book once all about names. Could you step outside? Yeah? That'd be great. Please. Wil? I gave you something. - Yep. - Do you have it? - Yep. - Well, can I have it? - I'll bring it tomorrow. - Can you bring it today? - Bob. - What? - What is it? - Just get it. - What is it? - I need it. - See, the thing is, I know what it is, and it is not okay. - I can explain. - Explain, and I'll get it. - Why don't you go get it, and then I'll explain it. - No. - It's a little like do I give you the blowjob and then you pay me, or do you pay me and then I give you the blowjob? Do I go and kill that guy for you and you'll pay me, or you'll pay me first, and then I'll go kill the guy for you. - Fuck you. It's in my pocket. - Thank you. - Yeah, you're welcome. - It's bone. I, chipped this little piece from her sternum. I used my pocket knife. - This is not okay on so many different levels. - This is the piece closest to her heart. You did not. - Oh, I did. - That's illegal. I don't believe you because you're not that stupid. - Okay. It's a rock. Actually no, it's a shell and I found it outside of the fence of the tar pit. You happy now? Doesn't matter what it is. What matters is it's something that brings me close to her, in contact with her, that inspires me. It is the essence that, that precedes existence. It's transformative. - You're talking about a dead thing. Nobody knows what she looks like, who she is, dead. - She helps me write. She makes me happy. - Oh my god, shut up. - Admit it. This is the first time you actually seen me write. - Yes. - And that's all you need to concern yourself with. - Bob, you have to tell me what to do. Do I let you finish the book? Do I call a doctor? Do I tell somebody what's going on? - Just let me write the book, please. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - It's okay to cry, you know. I'm okay with it. - I don't know what to do. - We'll just do this. You and me. Simple. No complications. - What happened? Are you, are you okay? Okay, okay, stay there. I'll get this. I'll do it. I don't want you to cut yourself. Why won't you to cut yourself. - Cause I won't. - Well, I can help. - Be careful. - Why are you treating me this way? Why are you treating me like some kind of a child? Like an invalid? - I just... - I can help pick up a few goddamn pieces of glass. You're turning me into, into... - I'm not turning you into anything. You're turning yourself into... - Why are you treating me like an invalid then? - I am not. - Well, what do you call this? - I am just trying to prevent... - What are you really trying to do to me? - I love you. - You love me? Oh, that's what you call this? You call this love? - I love you, so I don't want something to happen to you. - Do you think that if you treat me like some kind of a, a delicate little piece of glass sculpture that everything's gonna be okay? You can't even look at me. Look at me. Anybody that sees me knows I'm not some fragile piece of glass shit. If they spent a couple of hours with me, they would know that. - You weren't. - What? - You weren't. - What are you talking about? - You weren't fragile, but now you are. I, you, you don't seem like yourself. I mean you're, you're, you're hollow. I'm trying to reach you, but I can't. I don't feel any connection with you. I mean you say all the right things. But it means nothing. I don't know who you are anymore. I don't know where you are. I mean you're standing right in front of me, but I feel like you're not here. - You're insane. You've completely lost your mind! I give you everything, everything I have. I tell you, I call you, I tell you I love you. I walk on, on fucking eggshells around you. Fuck you. - Fuck you. You sound like the idiot. Do you want a divorce? What? - Do you want a divorce? - Why would I want a divorce? - Answer the question. - Oh Jesus Christ. - I don't know what to do. - I'm sorry. We have to stop. I'm sorry. I have to sit down. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I feel like I'm going to faint. Good to see you Bob. So, this is it? - Yeah. It's interesting. - It's not what the public expects from you. - We actually think his readers will be willing to go in this direction. - It's a risk. And as you know, it can work. Sometimes it does. But more often than not, it doesn't. And then you lose your credibility. - At which point it will be hard to sell them on what they expect because you've broken the spell, so to speak. - Meaning possibly nobody will believe you. Nobody will take you seriously, possibly. - We've explained this to him. He understands. - Yeah, he's not kidding. I've tried to warn him. It won't work. - If it doesn't work, it doesn't work. I'm willing to take the risk. - Look, we're just trying to protect you, okay. You got, no thank you. You've got families to you know, support. You've got a reputation to uphold. If you want to continue to work, and believe me, we want you to, to have an extended career, to be able to work while you grow old... - It's very simple. Either you will publish the book, or I'll take it somewhere else. - Bob. With respect, we've had some interest from two separate houses. - Okay, then. We'll bring in what's his name? - Rodrigo? - Rodrigo from the poetry department, and he'll take charge of the rest of it. We're done here? - Did you have a design and cover approval, or did you already have an idea? - I know what I want to do. - Before they go and waste more money on hiring a graphic designer... - Gentlemen, thank you. Thank you. What the fuck, Wilhelmina? - The book is the book. It has nothing to do with us? I didn't want it to interfere. - The book is the book? Don't want it to interfere with us, right, yeah. Bob. Us. What the fuck are you talking about? You are right. You're right. I hate that you're right. - So are we gonna have sex? Cause I only have like an hour. - I don't know if I can. What am in gonna tell Mary? Okay. Maybe. - Come quickly. Come, mi amore. Come. Oh, come on Bob. Don't do that, come on. That's not fair. Bob, it's not fair. It's not fair. - Shit. - Hello? - Bill, we need to talk. - Mary, it's, it's not a good time. What are you doing? - I'm just... I got another letter from the Bursar's office at Buckley for the twins. What? Charlie's in trouble again. - Mary, listen. Let me call you back, okay? Shit. Okay, Bob. Bob. Listen to me. Buddy. We got to talk. I know you're going through a bad time. I know you're going through a bad time. We all know you're going through a bad time. Okay, buddy. We all do. But it's important in these moments, in these moments to do anything rash, rash, impulsive. Life is a wave. Life's a wave. You know that. It's good and bad. It's good and it's bad. We'll get through this. I'm here for you. I'm here for you. I've been here with you since the first day, since day one. It's gonna be our year. You and me. Buddy. I can make it happen. You just give me a story of a book coming in the future, you know, like a sequel. - No. - Something based on your previous work, like a prequel? - No. - Just something in the vein of what you've done before. No. - No. That's a lot of no's. You remember how we first met, Bob? Old bar and grill? 18th Street. Young, drunk, looking to get laid. You with three books, carrying one around with you and a manuscript thinking you're gonna be the next Raymond Carver. - That didn't happen. - I mean that depends on how you look at it. - Well, I didn't become Raymond Carver. - No, you became Joseph Robert Price, New York Times bestseller. It's took on a life of it's own. You don't see that? - Not what I wanted. - It's not what you wanted. I don't think you remember what it is that you wanted. - I sold out. - You what? What the fuck does that mean? Well, you sell out. Your books sell in airports. - Exactly. - Yeah, exactly. People stand in line for your books. There are book clubs for your books. - I don't care about that. It's not what I wanted. - You have anything that you want, buy anything that you want. You travel internationally, Paris for dinner, no problem. Not what you want. What do you want? You want to go back to this shitty, cold apartment in Brooklyn? One bedroom. You remember that place? Notes on the cupboard, pretending to be a Nabokov? On that, you tell me what happy means? You've lost perspective, and that's okay, Bob. In your position, that's understandable. Snap out of it, come on. This is you and me talking. Let's go. - You're right. - I'm glad we agree on that. - Exactly. That's what I'm doing. I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna start over. And that's what I'm gonna do. - That's an option. You're one. That's an option. Here's another option. It's gonna sound crazy, but stay with me. Rehab, okay. A month away. You do whatever you want. We'll say it's alcohol. We'll say it's drugs. Prescription, no, you know what we'll say, Bob, listen, sex addiction. Your books will fly off the shelves. - No. I'm doing this. Do you understand? This is what doing it looks like. - Bob, seriously, wake up. - It's too late. - And he approached Helen of Troy, the face that launched a 1,000 ships. Not now, Jackson. - And I, Paris, have come to take you away from that old and vile Menelaus. - Come on, I can't, I can't do this right now. - Oh, fair woman, the most beautiful woman in the world sent to me by Aphrodite herself. - Jackson, the show opens tonight. Everything has to be perfect. - And it'll be perfect. I mean you thrive on making the possible out of the impossible. - Stop. Just stop, okay. - Look, look, just look around, right. It's perfect. Close your eyes and visualize this place packed. It is perfect. - Okay, whatever. - Okay. I have more information for you. So, the obsidian mirror. The smoking mirror. Soul loss. I think I can help you, Helen. - Angelo, Luca, hey you guys are doing a great job. You want to take a little break? Maybe if you come back in like an hour. Maybe you can bring some Thai food. There's some petty cash at the front. That'd be awesome. Everybody's kind of hungry and tired. Good work. Jackson, can you help me get something down from the shelf in the storage closet? - Yeah. - Soul lost, tell me. - Yeah, okay, okay. So basically there's absolutely no connection between the La Brea woman and the Mayans and the Aztecs as we know them, right. I mean there art, their sculptures, whatever in which they flourished in AD. No one knows where they came from. Cortes obliterated them. You understand? Like we think of these as ancient cultures, right. They were developing when Europe was, right, you already know this, sorry. - No, I mean yes and no. Go on. - Okay, all right, so, so your Dia de los Muertos collection. - But that has nothing to do with them. I do know about these civilizations. Just tell me what you're gonna tell me, please. - Okay, okay. So the La Brea woman is about 9,000 years old, right, which maybe makes her one of the early ancestors, but, but not the other way around which is what I think you were thinking. - Okay. So? - So, I think I can help you, if you want to try. - Yeah? - Yeah.

For as has been said, every soul of man has by law of nature beheld realities, otherwise it would not have entered into a human being. But it is not easy for all souls to gain from earthly things a recollection of those realities, either for those who had but a brief view of them at a time earlier, or for which, after falling to earth, were so unfortunate as to be turned toward unrighteousness through some evil communication and to have forgotten the holy sights they once saw. Few then are left with which retain an adequate recollection of them; but these when they see here any likeness of the things of that other world, are stricken with amazement and no longer can control themselves; but they do not understand their condition, because they do not clearly perceive. - So, maybe we should drink a toast.
