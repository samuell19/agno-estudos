Smoking and drinking alcohol is injurious to health. Smoking and drinking alcohol is injurious to health. Be quiet. Don't make noise. Your stick is making more noise than our slippers. Oh dear, I forgot. Now it's okay. Come on. What's the time? - 9 O' clock. How do you know? - Can't you smell it? I'm sure 'Prema Nagar' movie started by now. I can forget her when I drink, but she won't let me drink. I can drink when I forget her, but she won't let me forget. Why does Father drink every night? Because his wife left him. Why did she leave him? Because he drinks every night. Do you think the moon came today? I don't know. He didn't tell me anything. Do you think the moon is our hostel watchman.. ..to tell you before he comes? I'm scared. It's okay. Whatever happens.. - You are responsible for it. Hey! - Wait for me. I think they are coming back from tuitions. Is that him? - No. This one? - No, no. That's him. That's him. The balloon boy. Catch him. Get ready. Hey! Beat him up. Beat him up. Why are you so confused? Beat him up! Okay. Okay. - Beat him up. Stop it! Why are you beating me? How dare you call my friend blind? Do you know what she did? What did she do? I came to give her chocolates on my birthday and.. ..she said 'I love you' to me. Is that true? Actually, I liked his voice.. So I said it. They say that you beat him up last night.. ..while he was returning from tuitions. Is that true? We? Beat him up? It is clear that they are senseless. But what happened to your sense? You know that we bump into things and fall down.. ..while walking in the hostel. Say something. You think we can go to Tilak Street.. - That's enough. How do you know it was Tilak Street? Father mentioned it just now. Me? No. You said it, Father. You do this in everything. You brought me slippers of two different sizes. Show me. You wore Adilaxmi's slipper on one foot. Adilaxmi! Why is she shouting on her when it is her mistake? She is like that. She's a devil. What is this nonsense, dad? Father, he is an idiot. - Say it now. Father, he is an idiot. Uncle, do you know what your son did? He gave me chocolates on his birthday.. ..and said 'I love you' to me. No, dad. I said 'I hate you' to her. See that? He is changing his words before you. He must have said the same thing to many others. Maybe one of them beat him up. Idiot! You are still a kid! You want girls and love already? I will teach you a lesson at home. I'm sorry, sir. Let's go, you idiot! Let's go! - Ouch! Why are you beating me, dad? Tell me the truth. You guys did this, right? Is it true that you drank last night, Father? That's not true. That's a lie. Then this is a lie too. You idiots.. "Black darkness is spread before our eyes." "But our hearts as pure as white snow." "Our smiles are as green as tender leaves." "Our friendship shines bright as the yellow sun." "There are many colors in us if you see with your heart." "Let's run wild with our hearts full of joy." "Let's do mischief and watch the wonders unfold." "We don't have blindfolds on our eyes." "Let's flap our colorful wings and touch the stars." "We don't have boundaries to our sights." I cooked it myself. Eat and tell me how it is. It is good. But if you add salt.. It will be even better. Sorry, I forgot. I will ask you something, you answer me honestly. What will you become if you are able to see in the future? I will become a doctor, Father. Oh. Doctors should prescribe medicines, not drink alcohol. I will become an engineer, Father. I will become a good police officer.. ..and arrest everybody that drinks at night. People who drink and drive? - Yes. But I don't drive after I drink. - But you oversee the hostel. Gautham, what will you become? I will see, Father. See? What will you see? They say that Taj Mahal is a symbol of love. I will see how it looks. I will see the sunrise in Kanyakumari. I will see the sunset in Goa. I will see Prince Mahesh Babu's movie.. ..first day, first show. There is no problem in your eyes. Why did you consult me? But my eyes are my problem, doctor. Remove them. What? - You heard me right. I came here to get my eyes removed. I beg of you. Remove them, doctor. Hey! They are not teeth filled with cavities.. ..or stones in your kidneys to get them removed. They are eyes. They are a gift from god. They are a gift to everybody else. But for me they are a curse. Ever since I was born, I was eager to get my eyesight. But ever since I got my sight, I'm wishing I remained blind. What is the problem that has you so disheartened? What is your sorrow? You won't believe me, doctor. You will think I'm mad. That's what I think of you now as well. First tell me your problem. Then I will decide what you should do. Tell me. I had no eyesight two years back, doctor. But I used to live like a king. 'If I help him cross the road and upload that photo..' '..on Facebook, I'll get many likes.' Come, I will help you cross the road. Did I ask for help? Did I ask for help? You want to upload this pic on Facebook, right? Don't play these tricks with me. Did I get ready so well to get help from you? - Okay. Some lucky girl will help me cross the road. Desire. - "I am waiting for you, baby." She is here. - "I am waiting for you, baby." Wow, she is beautiful. - "I am waiting for you, baby." She is mine. Supriya! Supriya! Will you help me cross the road? Is that my every day job? Nobody here has humanity. I've been standing here for the past half hour. Nobody offered to help me cross the road. So, please.. - Come on. How do you know my name? I can tell your measurements too if you have no objection. No need. - I was just joking. Idiot. - 'He is too smart.' Supriya! - Hmm? What do you feel when we walk seven steps.. ..holding each other's hands like this? - What? She feels that she is helping a blind man cross the road. Why are you still here? Why are you still here? - I'm leaving. Supriya! - Hmm? You don't have a boyfriend, right? - How do you know? If you had a boyfriend, you would be on his bike.. ..not at the bus stop. I earn 18,000 a month. After all the deductions I get 15,000 rupees in hand. I already applied in a couple of hospitals for my eyes. If someone dies I will get a call immediately.. ..and I will get a pair of eyes. Recently I paid two chits in Sriram Chits. One for 50,000 and the other for 20,000. If you agree, I'll use the first one for our wedding.. ..and the second one for our honeymoon. Should I do that? I help you cross the road as an act of kindness. If you cross your limits, I will push you under a truck. You will die instantly. Oh, really? That's fantastic, marvelous and barbarous. Thank you very much. Idiot! Useless life! What did you say to that girl? Why did she leave? She proposed, but I rejected her. - You rejected her? Don't be so shocked. We will be late for the show. Let's go. Hop on. Good morning, Vizag! You are listening to Radio 2.7 Big FM 'Listen, Play, Live.' I'm Love Doctor Gautham. Are you facing problems in love? Don't you have the courage to propose to someone? Then call me immediately. I will show the right path for your love. He can't see his own path. He says he will show the path to others. What is this crap? Hello! Who is this? My name is Swapna. I'm so happy to talk to you, Gautham. I'm happy too. Gautham, I've a small problem in my love life. Don't worry. The solution is in my pocket. - Really? You say you are in love, did you see the Taj Mahal? Did he see it? I saw it 25 times. In fact, I see it in a new light every time. What is he talking about? Does he even know how it looks? Why do you care? Okay, Swapna. What is your problem? I'm afraid to propose to my cousin. Please help me. Definitely. There's only one rule to this. Go to him, close your eyes and tell him. Close your eyes? - Yes. Because if you close your eyes, it will be dark. If it is dark, you will get the courage. And if you get the courage, you will be reckless. And recklessness is a very thrilling thing. Rubbish! He is talking from his own experience. He can be so positive about his problems. Okay, Swapna. All the best! I'm playing a lovely song for all of you. Enjoy. Now watch me. How did he jump like that? Who kept this bottle here? Look where he hit me. It's okay. He is blind. How did you know that he wanted to trip you? He never washes his socks. Hello? Thank you, sir. I'm coming. Buddy, there's a heart attack patient at the hospital. I might get my eyes if he dies. Let's go. - Really? Come on. Not that way, this way. Why did you buy such a big garland? Isn't it too much? He is going to give me his eyes. Not just a buy garland, I can even hoist a flag in his honor. But he should die first. Oh, Jesus! How can I live without Thomas? I think he died. Come on, let's comfort her. How can I live? Auntie, past is past. We can do nothing to change it. Think about the future now. If we can order a coffin, we can pack uncle's body.. ..after removing his eyes. Hey! What are you talking, man? He is undergoing a surgery. Uncle is still alive? Oh God! Auntie! Be quiet. Oh my God! - Sorry, auntie. Auntie, how long have you been married? We aren't married yet. We are still living together. We'll get married very soon. What will they do after getting married at this age? That is not our concern. Auntie! - Yes? Does uncle have eyesight problems? No. He doesn't use specs. He can thread a needle in a second. Wow! I can wait all day for such eyes. My God! Sit down. Sit down. Oh, Jesus. Jesus, if you quickly finish this case.. ..I'll come to the church and light 100 candles. Oh, God! I will light 10,000 candles if you save Thomas. Ignore that, Jesus. If I get my eyesight.. ..I will directly come to Medak Church. I will directly come to Jerusalem. Why? Why don't you two go to Him directly? God bless my Thomas. Nothing to worry. He is out of danger. Thank you, doctor. My son, Thomas is alive. Let us go and see him. I can't see. First you go and see him. Thank you, Jesus. Happy married life. - Hey! God! All these years I thought I don't have eyes. But I just realized that you don't have ears. What's wrong? He gave us chips to eat and beer to drink. I see. Are you upset that He didn't give you pickle to lick? Shut up! I've been praying to Him for 25 years. Can't He hear me? I don't have any big dreams. One girl, two eyes, three kids and 60 years of life. But even these small wishes are not coming true. Darn. Do you know something? - What is that? That girl this morning.. That one you rejected? She rejected me. - Oh God! Not just her, many girls left me because I'm blind. We can't see if we are blind.. ..but who says we can't love someone? Nonsense. Gaining eyesight is not in our hands. But invoking love in someone is in our hands. Yes. See a girl's heart, not her beauty. Then, your life will be good. - Come near. I can't even see the person, how can I see the heart? That's very easy. Generally girls with good hearts.. ..place their hands around a lamp to protect it from wind.. ..place dolls in the hands of street children while they are asleep.. ..in one word, girls who help others willingly. One of those girls can bring light to your life. Two, not one. We should have four pegs. They may close the Janatha Bar before we reach. First start the bike. - Okay. Hey, what's wrong? The bike is giving me trouble. Let me check. Excuse me! Any problem? Do you want a ride? In one word, girls who help others willingly. Thanks. Let's go. What about my bike? - Stay here and get it in the morning. No. Come on. - Hello! Oh dear! - Buddy! Very nice. Is the car color your choice? Yes. I love this color. Oh. - Which color is this? I will tell you in the room. Let's go. Sit behind. This is behind. Maybe he thinks this is the front seat. Where do you have to go? - Janatha Bar. What? Drop us at Gajuvaka Central. You both had drinks, right? We drank Thumbs Up. Did you mix whiskey with it? Did you mix alcohol in it? - No. No, he didn't. Look, don't pretend before me. If you drink and drive, you'll put yourselves.. ..and others in danger. That's why I offered you a ride. She is a girl with a good heart. Did you notice it too? What will you get by drinking alcohol? Drink water instead of beer. Drink pineapple juice instead of wine. Sister! Beer is 80% water. Wine is 70% juice. That's why we drank it. Is it wrong? Yes, it is wrong. She said so. We are very sorry. I understood your problem. I have a good idea.. ..to help you to stop drinking. What is that? In order to kill a bad habit.. ..you need to shift to a good habit. - Oh. In the same way, if you want to stop drinking.. ..find a good girl and love her. Then all your concentration on drinking.. ..will be diverted to love. Done. - Huh? Done. - Looks like he fell for her. Sister! You are digging your own grave. What? - He is drunk. Shut up. You continue. If you feel like drinking, close your eyes and think of her. You will never touch alcohol in your life again. This idea is superb. You destination is here. - Oh God! So soon? We should've said Steel Plant. - Or Amaravati. Get down. You drive well. - Thank you. It's okay. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Remember us. She is a good girl. Hey.. Note the car number. Note it down. I noted it. But why? To fall in love. - To fall in love? Yes. Girls reject me because I'm blind, right? So I will approach her as if I'm normal and.. ..make her fall in love with me. - How will you do that? I will tell you. But I want full details about.. ..her office, the place where she has coffee.. ..and the park that she goes for jogging. Why did you bring me to a hospital? Did someone die to give me his eyes? You will die if I tell you the reason. She works as an eye doctor in this hospital. She is an eye doctor and I'm a love doctor. We are a family of doctors. As if you studied MBBS. Do you think it is possible.. ..for a blind man to convince an eye doctor otherwise.. ..and make her fall in love? Stop your nonsense. You will see it with your own eyes. Don't worry. First give me the blueprints of this hospital. This hospital is spread across 5 acres of land. I got it. The mortuary is to the right and the pharmacy is to the left. Now I'll go to the pharmacy and buy a Crocin tablet. Superb. - Watch me. Move aside. - Be careful. Oh God! Sorry, sir. - Watch where you are going. Oh God! - Hey, get up. Who kept a dustbin here? The doctors kept it here as a part of 'Clean India' program. Do you want the details now? Let's go. This is the hospital canteen. Don't move until I tell you to. She comes here for lunch every day. Let's practice, okay? Okay? - Done. Hey! Hey! Sorry, sir. Your love story will be the cause of my death. Madam, see these reports. Keep them in my room. I will check them later. Okay, madam. Hello, mom! Nethra, your dad selected a marriage alliance for you. The boy will come to the hospital canteen today. Meet him. Is this necessary now? I'm not interested. Why are you so scared of marriage? Do you love anybody? Just tell me, I will help you. Shut up! - Give it to me. Look, Nethra. You have to meet the boy today. - Mom! Otherwise I'll be in trouble with your dad. Okay. I'm tense. Understood? I'm perfect. Secret Temptation. She is here. You are more dangerous than a dog squad. Hey! - Yes? You stay connected with Bluetooth. If I do something wrong.. - Should I run away? Inform me. - Okay. Now maintain distance. - Okay, bye. Hi, good morning. I'm your love doctor Gautham. I'm here. - Why? She is long gone. You can start your FM program there. Let's go. Where did she go? There. - Where? To the canteen. Nethra? Rajesh. Since my parents selected this alliance.. ..I thought you'll be a plain looking girl. You are hot. What? Are you shocked? I'm very open. I like people who are open. If we want to become close, first we should open up. How do I look? Give me an honest reply. You are very black. Black? Black? Do you think black is cheap? You like black money, but you don't like a black man. Sorry. Oh no, come on, control Rajesh. It's okay. Be open with me. I won't mind. Order, sir. - Huh? Openly tell him what you want. One chocolate with ice-cream. Chocolate? Chocolate? Are you a small kid? Will you die if you don't eat it? Order something else. One chocolate ice-cream with two spoons. Okay, sir. - You are.. Didn't you openly tell him about me yet? She is to your right. I'm asking you. - What is he doing here? Hi. I'm Gautham. I'm her boyfriend. Their parents didn't agree to our marriage. But their refusal didn't stop our love, bro. I'm a very open person like you. I heard that you are going to marry her. Congrats. I'm not saying this because she is my girlfriend.. ..but she is very caring, bro. Once when I had fever, she stayed in my house.. ..for five days, you know. - Me? Five days? Openly. She told her parents that she is.. ..going on a botanical tour. That reminds me, she loves Goa, bro. She stops talking to me if I don't take her there.. ..every three months. This is all a part of my plan. Don't worry. After your marriage, all three of us can plan a trip. Three of us? - Yes. You can openly continue as her husband before others. I will be her boyfriend when nobody is around. Disgusting. I've never heard worse words than these. Think about it, bro. Shut up. It is so gross that I can't even imagine it. I said I'm an open man, but not so open. I'm leaving. Bro! Just think about it once. - Shut up. Thanks, you helped me a lot. - It's okay. How did you know about my problem? I heard you on the phone a few minutes back. Oh, okay. What brings you here? You told me to find a good girl and love her. - Yes. So, I came to find someone here. She got up. You saved me. Thank you. By the way, I'm Nethra. She wants to shake hands with you. "For the first time ever, my heartbeat says I love you." "For the first time ever, my pulse-rate is not in control." "For the first time ever, there is sunrise in my life." "For the first time ever, I like my life because of you." "I lost my mind. I became crazy." "I lost my mind. I can't sleep anymore." "I lost my mind. My heart is beating rapidly." "I lost my mind. My life has a meaning now." "For the first time ever, my heartbeat says I love you." "For the first time ever, my pulse-rate is not in control." "She's really super, I'm in a stupor.." "..she has made me an offer and changed my future." "Everything is set, this is the beginning of my love story.." "..my life will be a helicopter ride after my marriage." "I was searching for a torch light.." "..and you found me like a satellite." "I was lost and you came to me like a Google map." "One touch from you and my heart is singing.." "..a love song in high pitch." "One word from you and my heart soars like a kite.." "..revolving around you." "I lost my mind. I became crazy." "I lost my mind. I can't sleep anymore." "I lost my mind. My heart is beating rapidly." "I lost my mind. My life has a meaning now." "You filled my body with your flavor.." "..as if I've been dipped in a perfumed river." "You occupied my mind like a high-beam light." "You made me hot with just one smile." "As if luck came knocking on my door.." "..you held my hand, walked with me, changed my fate." "I lost my mind. I became crazy." "I lost my mind. I can't sleep anymore." "I lost my mind. My heart is beating rapidly." "I lost my mind. My life has a meaning now." "For the first time ever, my heartbeat says I love you." "For the first time ever, my pulse-rate is not in control." Good morning, Vizag! If you get hurt, consult a doctor. If your heart is hurt, consult this love doctor. I will play a lovely song for you now. Enjoy. Will he take a needle and thread and stitch a heart back? Hello, Nethra. I'm Kishore. Gautham is in a program now. Will you come to Yarada Beach immediately? Okay, we will come. Bye. Who was it? Girlfriend? - Yes. Does this black face need a girlfriend? She is not my girlfriend, she is Gautham's girlfriend. This is not fair. You can trip a girl and make her fall for you. But he can't do that too. Stop it. That girl is interested in Gautham. Why do girls search for such defected guys to love? They just use a normal man like me and discard me. Disgusting. - What is it, Sudarshan? He is here. - Looks like you are cribbing about something. He has nothing else to do. Nethra called up. - What did she say? She asked us to come to Yarada Beach. Let's go then. Wait here. I will go give this program sheet to Nalini. Hurry up. - I'm coming. Water, sir. Oh God! Sorry, buddy. I think you became wet. Wet? I'm burning here. It's just water. It will dry off. Oh God! How did he find out that it was coffee? Okay, thank you. Careful. - Hi! Hi! - Hi! Why did you call us here all of a sudden? We would've come prepared if you had told us earlier. Prepared? He meant that we could've taken leave from work. Oh, I see. - So, why did you call us? Our hospital is conducting an eye donation camp. - Oh, very nice. But nobody here is willing to donate their eyes. - Oh. If you donate first, you might inspire them to do the same.. ..so I asked you to come. What? Aren't you interested? Why not? I can donate them. They want eyes. Will you donate them? Yes, eyes. Our eyes. Let's donate them. What will you give? You've no eyes. But I will get new eyes very soon. What will I do with them after I die? I can help somebody else if I return them. Come on, you also donate your eyes. - Thank you. Sign here. First you, buddy. - Okay. Done. - Thank you so much. Did you see that? How simple it is to donate your eyes. Please come forward and do it. It won't harm you. How can we do that? We will donate some money.. ..if you want, but who would want to donate their eyes? Who said that? People without eyes are not blind. You are blind because even though you have eyes.. ..you do not understand the pain of others. We still have blind people amongst us.. ..because nobody wants to donate their eyes. Otherwise they all would be seeing the world by now. Why do you love those eyes that will turn to dust after you die? We can't stop someone from being born as a blind man. But we can definitely stop a man from dying a blind man. Wow! Your speech about eyes is amazing! I'm sure that girl fell for you. Actually.. - Sir, shall I send the patients in? No. Don't send anybody in. Cancel all my appointments. Okay, sir. - Hey, Geetha! Yes, sir? - You also don't come in. Okay, sir. Interesting. What next? The location is a coffee shop. Why did you bring me to a coffee shop? Surprise. Sit here. I will be right back. Okay? I will be back. Surprise? Sit on the right side. Right side. Why can't I sit on the left? Sure. Sit on the girl's lap if she agrees. Oh no! Forget it. Hi! - Good morning, madam. I designed it as you asked. Wow, superb. All the best. - Thank you. This is for you. We'll have coffee later. First tell me what the surprise is. Your coffee will tell you that. Coffee will tell you? What will coffee and tea say? I don't know. How will I know? I'm sitting in a corner. 'Why is he drinking it like that without any feeling?' Yuck. Waste coffee. - Waste? Worst. - Worst? It was full of bubbles. - Bubbles? So, you didn't like it? - Not at all. If you don't like my surprise, I can't journey with you. Goodbye. - Goodbye? Where are you going? Nethra! Nethra! What did you do? She left without paying the bill. What did I do? I just said the coffee is not nice. What did you do? Madam went to great lengths.. ..to write 'I love you' in that coffee. But you simply mixed sugar in it and drank it. She wrote 'I love you' in the coffee? Why didn't she directly say it with her mouth? Why do such creative things? God gave you such big, big eyes. Can't you see it? Hey! Tell him! He is a dark night. Nethra! Nethra! Sorry, Nethra. You said that I need to love a good girl.. ..if I want to change. You are the only good girl I know. I love you. - Hey! Who are you? What is this? Why did you say 'I love you' to me? Sorry, madam. Sorry, madam. Every woman that wears the same perfume is not Nethra. Sorry, madam. My friend is blind. Oh, it's okay. 'He is blind?' First remove those specs. You remove that Bluetooth. You were with me all this time and I didn't even realize.. ..that you are blind. I'm such a big fool. Correct, sister. And you donated your eyes? But he inspired so many to donate their eyes, right? He cheated me with your help, right? How did he pretend to see normally before me? Practice makes man perfect, sister. If it was a really big location, we used to go there.. ..the previous night and worked hard to get it right. If it was a small location, we managed it with Bluetooth. Yes. - Yes. I had a really tough time as his coach, sister. Why did you hit him? I did all this for your love. Oh. Are you trying to cover it up because you got caught? I wanted to tell you the truth, but before I could.. Don't tell me stories. Don't try to cheat me more. You believed me every time I said a lie. Why not believe me when I'm telling the truth? Are all girls like this? Don't they use your brains? How dare you blame me for your mistake? You are blind but still very arrogant. What did you say? I fell down many times and got hurt because I'm blind. I didn't feel any pain then. But I'm feeling the pain now. Let's go. Careful. I'm a very unlucky man. My parents left me because I was born blind. My friends left me after they got their eyesight. Now she left me too. Hey, don't be sad. They should be sad for losing a person like you. Do you think I will ever get my eyesight? Or will I remain blind all my life? He called me, you know. Hi, Nethra. - Kishore, can you come to my hospital right now? May I come in, sir? - Come in. Sir, look at this file. It will be good if we donate these eyes to my friend. Sorry, Nethra. We have so many applications for eyes. You know that too. - I know, sir. But please help him. I need to answer so many people. Okay. - Thank you, sir. Thank you so much. Okay? - Done. Thank you, sister. Thank you. But don't tell Gautham that I helped him. Why? - Just don't tell him. Yes! Yes! He will be able to see! Wait, wait, wait. I can't believe that I will be able to see. I'm nervous. Are the doctors perfect? Perfect. - Are there any cases on this hospital? No, buddy. Let's go. Do they have a generator to use if there is a power-cut? Yes. - Wait a minute. Tell them to see if their eye drops have bacteria in it. Tell them that we know the MLA of Tenali. Then they will take their job seriously. They called you here to give you eyesight. Don't ruin it. Just shut up. Sorry. Please don't mind. Doctor! - Yes? Do you guarantee that I will get my eyesight? What will you do if you get your eyesight? One girl ditched me because I don't have eyesight, doctor. I see. As soon as I get my eyesight, I will find a girl.. ..who is more beautiful than her and fall in love with her. Doctor! - Hmm? What if I can't see anything? Then you will never see in your life. One minute. That's good. Now open your eyes slowly. Slowly. Oh God! I can't see anything! Buddy! Buddy! Now I'll never be able to see, Kishore. Sue everyone in this hospital. - Hello! Don't leave anyone out. Hello, listen! Relax! - Don't leave anyone out. Even we can't see clearly in this room. This is the dark room. Since heavy rays can damage.. ..your eyes, we brought you here. Mr. Rao! Put on the light. Okay, doctor. Open your eyes slowly. Slowly. Good. Can you see now? I can see, doctor. I can see. Very good. - I can see, doctor. Buddy! It is me. Your friend Kishore. Kishore! - Yes? Why are you so ugly? I was just kidding. I got my eyesight. I can see. I can see. I got my eyesight. - Yes, buddy. I got my eyesight. - You got your eyesight. I can see. You can see. Don't jump too much. Your eyes are still fresh, they will fall down. Shut up. - You can see the world now. I can see. 'Whose vehicle is that? How is it connected to me?' Don't assume that it is true. I wonder if that 9999 number plate really exists. Don't think too much. Forget it. Really? - Yes. Okay. Priest! Offer special prayers on my son's name. Why did you come here? Why do people come to the temple, sir? I came to join my hands and pray before God. Maybe you don't know, but this God is very powerful. One year back, one customs officer cancelled my contract.. ..stating that I'm smuggling goods. I came and prayed here that day. Within a week he died in an accident. When I heard that you seized my goods.. ..I came here to pray about it. If my work is done I will offer a goat, otherwise.. What? Are you threatening me? Forget me, you can't scare even my four year old son. He is just four years old, sir. He doesn't know about me. I can understand if he is not scared of me. But you are 40 years old, sir. You know me very well. You have to be afraid of me. Hey, get out! Husband! Husband! Husband! You are troubling God for giving you eyesight.. ..and me for giving you a bike. I'm catching up on what I missed till now. Hey, be careful. Oh God! I'm sorry. Buddy, help me. Get up. Get up. God gave me eyesight and sent me an angel too. Where? - There. After getting his eyesight, he is flirting with me.. ..without realizing who I am. She is.. - I will kill you if you tell him. Any trouble? Gastric trouble. Get lost. Go away. Do your work. I'm really sorry. My driving is perfect. But my buddy doesn't know how to sit properly. I hope you didn't get hurt. 'He might recognize me if I talk.' Mute? Yes, she is mute. Why do you want to talk to a mute girl? Let's go. Shut up! If I run away from her because she is mute.. ..like Nethra ran away from me because I'm blind.. ..what will be the difference between me and her? Do you know how Nethra looks like? Even if she is more beautiful than her, I will love this girl. Please come. Listen! I love you! "This world is full of mystery. Life is full of mystery." "I became a rocket launched from Sriharikota." "Is this a dream or reality? I fell in love." "I became excited just like a kid in a candy store." "With just one look of yours.." "..you imprinted a permanent love symbol in my heart." "You gave my life 100 marks with a permanent marker." "My heart is dancing at a record speed." "I hit the love jackpot by a lucky chance." "My heart is dancing at a record speed." "My pulse rate is jumping like Rehman's music beats." Aarthi. Archana. Pooja. "How can a single look from you give me such a high?" "My heart is rotating around itself like the earth." "I understood what true love is after I saw you." "Shall I forget my flashback and start a new story?" "My heart is filled with mute love for you." "How can I ever express my happiness in words?" "My heart is dancing at a record speed." "I hit the love jackpot by a lucky chance." "My heart is dancing at a record speed." "My pulse rate is jumping like Rehman's music beats." "This world is full of mystery. Life is full of mystery." "I became a rocket launched from Sriharikota." 'That's the gift I gave him.' I brought it as a special gift for you. 'You are giving me the gift I gave you?' "You came down on me like a monsoon of jasmines." "You completely changed my dull life and made it thrilling." "I feel like I'm surrounded by colorful festivals." "All the clouds in the sky are under my feet now." "I feel like I got a lifetime free Jio sim." "My body is rushing forward like a vehicle with no brakes." "My heart is dancing at a record speed." "I hit the love jackpot by a lucky chance." "My heart is dancing at a record speed." "My pulse rate is jumping like Rehman's music beats." "This world is full of mystery." What is this? What is going on? You committed a murder and now you are coolly joking. If you get caught, you will get 14 years of imprisonment.. ..under IPC Section 497, you know? Lawyer sir, Section 497 is for illegitimate affairs. Oh. Then they will punish you under Section 376. That will be for a rape case. You tell me which section it is. According to the India Penal Code.. ..Section 302 for murder and 307 for attempted murder. Oh God! Everyone commits crimes, researches the law.. ..and think they are Kamna Bhattmalani. Not Kamna Bhattmalani, sir. Ram Jethmalani. And it takes great courage to arrest boss. Stop. You need permission to meet boss. Move aside! Babji! You are happily eating 'Biryani' here.. ..after committing a murder? Sir! One says, 'Star hero is my father.' Another says, 'Sridevi is my wife.' Every idiot has the right to say something. But there should be some evidence. Read it. See what it is, Lawyer. Oh God! What you are eating is not Chicken 'Biryani'.. ..it is 'Peacock Biryani.' Put it away. Peacock meat? I'll arrest you with a 6 month non-bailable warrant.. ..for eating peacock meat. In these 6 months I'll gather evidences for your crimes.. ..and make sure that you remain in jail permanently. Who served me Peacock 'Biryani'? DCP! A criminal thinks only like a criminal. But a policeman can choose to think like a criminal too. Let's go. - Hey! Oh God! Alexander the Great conquered the whole world.. ..but died with a fever. In the same way, he killed.. ..so many people but went to jail for killing a peacock. Do something, sir. I will. According to Section 490.. Forget it. I will read the book tonight and.. ..say it correctly tomorrow. Idiot! Can't you see? - Sorry. Sorry? Is it enough to say sorry? It's okay. He said sorry. We don't want any trouble with goons. Let it go. Why should I let it go? Did God give me a mouth.. ..to keep quiet when I face injustice? You are right. You! Have you gone blind? Idiot! Oh God! Why did you call me here? She pretended to be mute. We also pretended in the past. How can you cheat me like this? We cheated her in the past. Hello! You can discuss your grievances with me. I don't discuss anything with cheaters like you. What do you call what you did? You gave me the same gift that I gave you. I had to do that because I didn't have money. What should I do? - Yes. Modi sir banned all old notes during that time. Look! You did a mistake and I did a mistake. Tit for tat. What is tit for tat? Do you know what that means? I have nobody else in this world except you. Do you know what that means? I will die without you. I learnt mute language for you in just 30 days. What did you do? What did you do? Do you know who gave you those eyes? Dr. Hidimbi. - Rubbish. She did. She wanted to show you the world.. ..even if you don't want to see her. She requested the Dean to give you those eyes.. ..and she herself made the arrangements for surgery. Then why didn't you tell me? I didn't want you to love me because I helped you.. ..or did a favor to you. I wanted you to love me for who I am. Superb. Superb. Your love is a success too. So, why do you want me to remove your eyes? Exactly at that moment, one villain entered my life, sir. Shall I go? You can go after you give me the four things I want. No way. - At least three? If you talk too much, I'll give you one punch. Bye. Is she beautiful? Beautiful? Whoever is my darling's father.. ..I will put a garland around his neck and touch his feet. What are you waiting for? Go ahead and do that. Sir, you are.. Her father. - Father in law! I'll hit you with my shoe. I'm not your father in law. You borrow 3,000 or 4,000 rupees from a girl. How dare you call me father in law? I wasn't talking about money, sir. - Then? You said 3. I meant H-U-G. A hug? - Yes. What is four? K-I-S-S. K-I-S-S, a kiss. This is very wrong. No, sir. I said 'Kismis' which means raisins. Don't act innocent now. You asked for a kiss. How can you ask a girl to kiss you in a public place? Sir, as a father you may feel this is wrong. But these things are common in love affairs these days. What do you do for a living? I'm a jockey, sir. Jockey? Do you sell underwear on the streets? No. I'm a radio jockey, sir. - How much do you earn? I get 15,000 rupees in hand after all the deductions. Do you have any savings? - No. So you don't have foresight. I got my eyesight just one month back, sir. How will I have foresight? Disgusting. Why should I give you my daughter? I love her, sir. What other qualification do you need? Really? Are you such a great lover? - Yes. Come with me. I will settle this right now. Get a blood test done. - A blood test? Why? BP, diabetes, ulcers, cancer, HIV, bolli.. ..I have to make sure that you have none of these diseases. Why will I have HIV or bolli? I'm a gentleman. I have no such diseases. I have. - What? Doubts. I'm the girl's father. You have no money. So I have to make sure that you are at least healthy. Is that what you want? - Yes. I will get a clean certificate. Wait and watch. Go ahead. - Sister! Yes, sir? - Do all the tests available in this hospital. Okay, sir. A clean certificate. Perfect. See for yourself. Okay. Next test. Do you know this place? Yes, I know. 24,000 rupees per square yard. How much land do you own? And how much will you give me as dowry? So that you can sit and eat. I didn't bring you here to give you any land. Then? - I brought you here to make you run. Forget it. Fitness test is done. If you do another 19 rounds. 19 rounds? - Yes. Do you think these are like your walks after dinner? No. - Wait a minute. Hello! - If your father doesn't approve of us, will you elope with me? I will marry you only if my dad agrees. - Otherwise? You can marry another girl and I will marry another boy. Did she give her answer? Can I get a drinks break? You can take a break if you want. But then you'll have to start from scratch again. Hit me with your shoe if I ask for water. Good boy. You finished 20 rounds. I'm finished. Good. You have average fitness. Next. - Next? If you ride so fast, you will meet with an accident. Be careful. I'm feeling tired, sir. - You are riding a bike, not a bicycle. How should my son in law drive? If he twists the accelerator, the silencer should scream. Then watch me. Actually, it is.. You got drunk and rammed into a police vehicle? Alcohol? I didn't even drink water. My brakes failed, sir. We rammed into his car on purpose. What will he do? Be quiet. Let me talk. Please. Srinivas! - Yes, sir? Take the bike. - Okay, sir. Let him pay a fine in the court tomorrow to get it back. Sir! Sir! Sir! - Get out! Go. He made this Kulkarni walk. I will make him limp. What? I will make sure that he limps his way back home. Go fail the brakes of his car. That is a police vehicle, sir. Having physical strength is not enough. Courage is very important. Prove that you have it. This is your final test. What kind of tests are these? You don't want them? Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Do I have a choice? Go then. Okay, okay. No problem. I'm coming right away. I did it. - Good boy. I'm happy now. Come to my house tomorrow morning. We can discuss.. ..the wedding venue, number of guests and expenses. Sir! Don't call me sir. Call me father. Father! Father! Father! Father! Why did you directly come home? What are these clothes? These are traditional clothes. I came to discuss about our wedding. Wedding? Who is he? Your grandmother? Uncle didn't mention her. I thought she was dead. How much is your BP? 190? Bring it down. Bring it down to normal. She has to be healthy if she wants to play with our kids. I'm your future son in law. Bless me, mother. She is our maidservant. Idiot! You are always in a rush. I know. Sometimes a 100 rupees note.. ..is more valuable than a 1,000 rupee note. Who is it? Santoor Mom? You are...? Oh God! Bless me, mother. A small secret. You are more beautiful than your daughter. Take this as a compliment and please bring me coffee. Just a minute. Why are you creating a scene here? My dad is upstairs. Don't worry. I passed all the tests. So, the only thing left is our wedding. Don't you believe me? I will ask uncle to say it. Uncle! - He is upstairs. My little brother in law. If he is with me, I'll feel as if I have an elephant with me. Uncle! Uncle! Un.. What is he doing here? - What are you doing here? I came to meet Nethra's father, sir. Tell me. No, sir. I have to say this to her father. I'm Nethra's father. Tell me. You must be someone else's father, sir. Try to remember. What are you talking about? - Dad! Dad! He is the one I love. How can you love this man? Dad? If he is your dad, who is the man that.. ..made me go through all the tests and.. ..asked me to come home to talk about the wedding? Do you know what you are talking? Yes, Nethra. He asked me to fail the brakes of his car. You failed the brakes of my car? - Sir! Sir! Sir! - Dad! Sir, I didn't do it on purpose. He asked me to do it. Who is he? The man that was with me last night. You saw him. Nobody was with you. - Good morning, sir. Come, Srinu! Did you see him? Yes, sir. Last night we took his bike keys. Did you see anyone beside him? I think so, sir. Have you gone blind? There was nobody beside him. Yes, sir. No, Nethra. I'm sure your dad is playing some game. He came to the hospital with me yesterday. He made me do a blood test. I can prove it if you want. Is that so? - Yes. Is that so? Come on, then. I will prove it to you. I will prove it to you.. - Dad, please. I will finish you if I'm right. Come on. Yes, sir. Sister! - Okay, sir. Tell me, sir. - You gave me my blood test file, right? Yes, sir. See? See? There was a man with me yesterday, right? Nobody was with you, sir. You came alone. When you were talking to yourself I thought you had some problem. Yes, sir. I thought the same. Why will I have a problem? I did all the tests because he asked me to. She said there was nobody with you. Stop your drama. There was nobody with me? I will prove it to you. Get the CCTV camera footage. Hello! Show us yesterday's CCTV camera footage.. ..at the reception area. - Yes, sir. Yes, that's the one. Play it. - Sir. Do you understand it now? He is definitely mad. He is imagining a non-existent man and talking to him. Let's go. Nethra! Nethra! Wait, Nethra. Believe me. A man named Ranjith Kulakarni.. ..was with me the whole day yesterday. What was his name? Ranjith Kulakarni. Ranjith Kulakarni? Kulakarni? Dad, just a minute. I will be right back. Is he the one you are talking about? Yes, it is him. What are you talking? This man died two months ago. We gave you his eyes. Why are you still talking to this crazy man, dear? I don't mind if my daughter loves a poor man.. ..but I won't allow her to love a crazy man like you. I'll shoot you if I see you with my daughter again. Come on. Gautham! 'If he is dead, who was with me all day yesterday?' I'm the girl's father. How should my son in law drive? Call me father! I'm a spirit, son in law. What? The man that traveled with you is a spirit? I can't believe it. It is true, sir. Here, this is the man. Why did he approach you as your father in law? Why did he do those physical tests and medical tests? You have a couple of doubts, sir. I had a thousand doubts. Who will clear them? I can't ask him because he is a spirit. I'm doomed. Understood. Do you want to remove your eyes.. ..because you are scared of this spirit? No, sir. I got my eyesight after so many years.. ..I'm not a fool to lose them for such a small reason. Then, what is the reason? Ever since that day, I started getting scared for everything. Come out. Why are you so scared of me? I'm a human being like you. But you are still alive and I'm dead. That's all. Why don't you say you are a ghost? Why are you following me? Because you have my eyes. Nobody can see me except you. Ours is an eye-relationship. Will you torture me all my life? No. I have two wishes. If you fulfill them.. ..my soul will go to heaven. You won't have to bear my torture anymore. Thank God! I understood everything. So you want me to donate food on your name.. ..or offer prayers to pacify your soul. Is that right? Almost. That's very easy. I know a priest. He'll recite mantras as long as you want if I pay him 100 rupees. And there are lots of beggars in Vizag.. ..that I can donate food to. - Shut up. I will tell you what to do. 5,000 rupees are enough to donate food to the poor. Why did you ask me to bring 100,000 rupees? I will tell you. I will tell you. Right here. Stop the bike. You get delicious snacks here. - Snacks? Why did we come so far to buy snacks? And why only these snacks? One of my friends likes these snacks. He asked me for them before my death. But I died without taking them to him. Now I have to give them to him. I got it. Sentiment, right? - Yes. I will bring them. He is a soft soul. He wants snacks and sweets. Stop. Whom do you want? I want snacks. - Snacks? Father, someone is here. He wants snacks. He is coming. Who sent you? Rahim Bhai. - Rahim Bhai. 100,000 rupees. - 100,000 rupees for snacks? Yes. That's why I asked you to bring 100,000 rupees. But sir.. If you do this for me, one of my wishes will be fulfilled. 'Who is he talking to?' Give me the money. - Bring the snacks. Here you go. Take them safely. When will the lawyer bring our boss out? Didn't he arrange for the bail yet? That lawyer is a useless man. Yes, here. Stop. Why does this place look so shady? Why do you care? Give him the snacks on my name. Will you go away if I give this parcel to him? I have to give some sweets to another friend. Once you do that, I will surely go away. I wonder how many thousands that will cost me. You'll understand my pain if you stand in the ATM queue. Stop. Is sir inside? Yes. - Take this. What is this? - Snacks. I brought them for sir. I will give it to him. Now go. Tell him that Kulakarni sent them. Don't forget. Okay. - Thanks. Boss, Kulakarni sent you these snacks. Hurry up. Start the bike. Let me start. - Let's go. Let's go. What happened? What's wrong? Why isn't the bike starting? Don't worry, sir. It will start any minute. Wait. Don't worry? What you gave them is not snacks. Then? - It is a bomb. Where did he go? - Catch him! Don't let him get away! Oh God! Hey! Stop! Stop! Hurry up! Sir! Sir! Sir? Who tried to kill me with a bomb? Sir, I didn't know that there was a bomb inside. Sir! Sir! How dare you try to kill me! I'm innocent, sir. That spirit is doing everything. I will kill you! Sir! Sir! Sir! - How dare you mess with me! Sir! Sir! No, sir! - You are dead! I'm innocent, sir! - I will kill you! I will kill you! - Sir! I'm innocent, sir! It will fire! It will fire! Oh God! Sir! Sir! Oh God! He made me commit a murder too. Why did you leave me and run? I ran away because they will kill me if I get caught. You are already dead. Right? I forgot that in all that chaos. Don't you have any sense? - Why? You gave me a bomb in the name of snacks. I escaped death by an inch. Will you commit a murder if I ask you to? That's why I had to plan this. So, your two wishes are? Two murders. The sweets? - My next target. Impossible. You can't make me commit another murder. Please, don't say that. You will not say this if you know how Babji is. He and his gang commit so many atrocities in Vizag city. No, please! No! No! No! As a journalist, I wanted to expose his crimes. Unload the goods. - Okay, boss. Careful. You clicked nice photos even without proper lighting. For your silly newspaper that costs 2 rupees.. ..you were going to make me lose goods worth 2 billion? Isn't that wrong? That newspaper that costs 2 rupees has the power.. ..to drag a CM or a PM to the streets if he commits a crime. Be ready. Check him to see if he has anything else. Hey! Camera. Kashi! Crush him! Now tell me. Is it wrong to kill the people who killed me? Hey! Sorry, sir. I fall asleep when I hear stories. Does my revenge sound like a story to you? Revenge? You can narrate it to your son or daughter. Sorry, there's no chance for that. I'm a bachelor. So, you have to help me. I killed a man and somehow escaped from there. Don't create new problems. I will not commit a second murder. He is the man that died in the blast. Who killed him? Name is Kulakarni. We didn't find any other details.. ..except for his wallet and his photo. He looks like a kid but he is very dangerous. Sir, we are getting late to go to the court. Let's go. Ganga! - Yes, boss? List out all the gangs. Inquire about him. He shouldn't be alive when I come out of jail. You committed a murder? I didn't do it. I turned the gun towards him.. ..when he pressed the trigger. That's it. He died. That's called murder. Why did you go there? I didn't go. He took me there. He made this mess and now he is coolly watching TV. Yes! I'm not watching TV to while away my time. I'm looking for new methods to make you.. ..commit the second murder. Did you hear his cruel words? What should I hear and what should I think? Who are you talking to? Kulakarni who gave me his eyes. Kulakarni who gave you his eyes? Yes, his spirit. - Spirit? 'God! Did you give him eyes and take away his brain?' Hey! The other day you said you had a dream.. ..and now you are talking of Kulakarni. I think you will take your own life and my life too.. ..with your craziness. Say that to him, not me. He is asking me to commit another murder. Another murder? Dharma I.P.S? Why did you bring me here? Will you kill him too? I want to meet Nethra. Her father put her on house arrest thinking that I'm mad. I want to see her once. - But I want to live. Many people die for love. Lovers die for their love. Not their friends. I will be back in ten minutes. - But.. But, listen to me. You are going for your love. I know I will die. Nethra! Gautham? What happened to you? My dad thinks you are crazy. Why did you say you saw a dead man? Actually.. Why did you behave like that in the hospital that day? Are you really mad? No, not at all. Since I got my eyesight all of a sudden.. ..it was a hallucination induced by my imagination. That's all. Now everything is perfect. You don't have a problem now? I don't have a problem now? - No. I don't have a problem now? No. No problem? - No. "Lover! Lover!" "Your companionship is a celebration." "I don't want any distance between us." "Our union is a gift for me." "Don't stay beyond reach. Don't stay within limits." "Find time for me. This moon belongs to you." "Wanna.. Wanna be with you." "Wanna be with you forever." "Wanna.. Wanna be with you." "Wanna be with you forever." "Lover! Lover!" "Your companionship is a celebration." "One you. One me. There is nobody else in our world." "There is no space between us even for light breeze." "My luscious lips are glazed with honey." "Lover, come to me. Caress my cheeks." "Wanna.. Wanna be with you." "Wanna be with you forever." "Wanna.. Wanna be with you." "Wanna be with you forever." "I won't let this night end in this world." "I'll make this night stay with us for a hundred years." "This passion has taken hold of our hearts." "There is no looking back for us now." "Wanna.. Wanna be with you." "Wanna be with you forever." "Wanna.. Wanna be with you." "Wanna be with you forever." 30 seconds for a hug and 2 minutes for a kiss. This idiot has been gone for 15 minutes now. So.. What was that sound? Nothing, dad. - Really? Hmm. Okay. Hello! - You have been gone for 20 minutes. What are you doing? Come soon. You also come upstairs. Dad, your gun. I told you that you'll die if you come to see my daughter. Why did you come? Because I felt death is better than staying away from her. That's why I came. How dare you! Oh dear! Don't harm him. All my hopes are pinned on him. Be patient until he commits that second murder. Then you can chop him into pieces. I don't mind. Will you stop your crying? Who are you talking to? I was talking to your daughter, sir. - Daughter? She didn't cry. I thought she will cry. So, I said it as a precaution. Why did you love this mad man? Yes, sir. I'm mad. But not like you think. I'm mad about your daughter. If you think I'm mad for imagining things.. ..you are mad too for not seeing my true love. Yes, he is mad. - Mother! He is madly in love with your daughter. Don't call him mad. Your father left the Salt March and came back for me. He left the Salt March for this old woman? The Salt.. - Will you stop with your salt nonsense? So you think he is not mad? You will stay here for a week. Everyone will observe you. Me too. If you talk to the air in this one week.. ..or behave like a crazy man, I will throw you out. You should never think about him in your life again. Are you okay with this? Wow! What a condition! Now your remote is in my hand. You have to stab if I ask you to stab. You have to shoot if I tell you to shoot. Otherwise I'll make you look crazy before them. Hey, mad man! What are you thinking about? I'm okay with it, sir. This is exactly what I wanted. You already committed a murder this morning. Now you have challenged this man. I'm scared that you'll harm them tomorrow morning. This is not craziness. This is my planning. This is the right thing to do to keep me and my love safe. Don't worry about Kulakarni, I know how to get rid of him. Oh dear! He is talking about Kulakarni again. God! What is this torture? Hey! - Sorry, sir. Hi, uncle! What is all this? This is Misamma. This is Pochamma. This is Pedhamma. - My grandmother! Mad man! Why didn't you go to Kadapa Dargah as well? That's here, uncle. He has so much devotion at such a young age. That is fear, not devotion. Does this look like a house to you or a temple? Remove them. Remove them, son. You look like a sorcerer. Do it. Remove them. He will be back if I remove them. Who will be back? Bad luck. - It is already here. You are the most ill-fated person on earth. Remove them. You tried to get rid of me, right? You are finished. - Show him his room. Hey, not you. Gurudev, show him his room. This is your room. Wow! This is a comfortable place for spirits. I like it. I hate it. Do you call this a room? This is a dumping yard. You got that right. What is that smell? That's my old bed. I peed on it. All his sweet memories are in it. Can any human being stay here? You usually imagine things that don't exist. Imagine that this sofa as a bed, this window as an AC.. ..and this tap water as distilled water. Instead of imagining some unknown man.. ..if you just imagine that my sister is with you.. ..there won't be any problem at all. Sir, coffee. - Give that to me. Imagine that you drank it. You! Come with me! - Okay, sir. What kind of a life is this? I told you to murder that man and become a hero. But instead you chose to be insulted by this little kid. Look! No matter how much you provoke me.. ..I won't do another murder. You can't make me do it. I don't care what you say or do. If a living man can be so obstinate.. ..imagine how obstinate a dead man can be. You are finished. I will make you commit that murder. Son! 'Puri'? No, I don't want it. Will you have 'Wada'? I don't want it. "Listen, brother! This is our handsome hero's story." "Listen, brother! This is our handsome hero's story." "He became a puppet in a ghost's hands." "I doubt how his future will be." "The ghost is dangerous. He is playing tricks." "He is making this handsome hero's life miserable." "He looks funny." "He tortures the very life out of you." "He is controlling this hero's life." "He is bringing this handsome man to his knees." Why are you sitting like a man who lost his wife? I'm losing my dignity. Isn't that enough? I lost my life. Who should I complain to? This is just the warm-up match. I haven't started the series yet. I can't do this anymore. Let's come to an understanding. First let me make my love a success.. ..then I will see about your revenge. Don't think you can trick me with your smooth words. You don't believe me when I tell you the truth. You don't leave me alone too. What should I do with you? I swear on the girl I love. Are you happy? Alright then. I will help you to gain the girl you love.. ..instead of causing trouble. You'll have no problems from me. Take this. - Is this Kulakarni your gang member? No. Boss! Kulakarni is not a part of Shankar's gang. Find him. Find him. Why are you drawing lines on the wall, Babji? Are you counting how many days are left in jail? You will be permanently here now. I gathered evidences against all the crimes you did.. ..and created a file. I'm going to submit in court in 4 days. Then your fate will be sealed. Why are you smiling, sir? He will do what he said. He knows that he has that file in his house. He doesn't know that I bought a servant in his house.. ..to steal that file for me. Darn! What happened to that file? Why did you ask me to steal this file? I heard your father in law tell your mother in law.. ..that this is a very important file. When he doesn't find this file and becomes worried.. ..coolly go to him and say.. ..'Uncle! Is this the file? It was lying outside'.. ..'so I kept it safe thinking that it might be an important file.' That's it. Your father in law will look at you adoringly.. ..like you are the new 2,000 rupee note in the market. After that? - He will marry you. Sir? - Isn't it obvious? He will start having positive vibes.. ..about you instead of having negative vibes. Sir! Even though they burnt your body.. ..your brain is still very sharp. I'm glad you realized that. Go do your work. Is it safe? - Yes. Your idea is superb, sir. But why should I impress her family? Who are you talking to? Bluetooth. Kishore. Yes, tell me. - Is it? Give it to me. Okay, talk to you later. Bye. I need to talk to you. Do you really know what you are doing? It is okay if you don't impress my family.. ..but don't appear like a fool in front of them. Usually parents test their son in law to see if he is good. But in your case, they are testing to see if you are mad. If this continues.. - It won't. Definitely not. We came to a compromise. Compromise? With who? Your mother, grandmother and fat brother. Only your father is left. I've a master-plan to impress him. Don't worry. - Hi, everyone! Attention please! We are conducting a selfie contest to promote.. ..our brand new mobile. If you take the best selfie.. We will gift them a car worth 1 million! Are you ready, guys? - Are you ready, guys? Ready. - We are ready. Kulakarni! Where is this man? He went this way, sir. You are like buffaloes. Can't you catch a single man? We found his phone number, boss. Bye. Hello! - Pantham Babji. You are coolly going around the city with your lover.. ..after killing my man? Do you think you can survive after targeting me? I will bring you out from your hiding. Should I describe your death to you? You.. Pantham Babji found my number. He explained in great detail how he will kill me. There's only one way to get out of this alive. What is that, sir? Kill him before he kills you. Do you have a conscience? I'm scared that he will kill me and you want me to kill him. There is no other way out of this. How can the file go missing? I kept it safely. But I can't find it now. How can you tell me so coolly that the file is missing? Uncle, that file is with me. I saw it lying on the table, so I kept it safely with me.. ..assuming that it must be an important file. Thank you. Thank you very much. Go bring it. Okay. - Good boy. Where is the file? It is not here. It is missing? Where is the file? The file is missing, uncle. - It is missing? It is missing? Do you know how valuable that file is? And how did you know that it is an important file? Actually.. - Answer me. In order to impress you.. ..it was Kulkarni's idea to steal it. Huh? Kulakarni? The one who gave his eyes to me. His spirit is here. Spirit? Did you hear that? He can see a spirit. Do you believe that he is mad? Because of your craziness.. ..a dangerous criminal will get out of jail tomorrow. This is what happened when he stayed here a week. So, imagine what will happen if he stays here forever. Nethra, believe me. I'm not mad. Hey, stop it. - I can really see his spirit. I can really see his spirit. He is right, sir. Trust him. Consult a good doctor, Gautham. I won't raise my hand on a mad man like you. Get out of my house. He says he sees a spirit. Hey! I'm sorry. I didn't expect this to happen. Don't say a word. You made me look like a crazy man.. ..to my lover and her family. And that gangster will kill me very soon. I imagined great things for my life after getting my eyesight. Did you let at least one of my dreams come true? You died in the blink of an eye. Do you know how painful it is to lose the person you love? Forget it. I'm facing all these problems because of my eyes. I won't be able to see you if I don't have these eyes. I will get them removed. What are you saying? I lived without eyesight for 25 years. Can't I live another 25 years? I don't want your eyes. I will get them removed tomorrow. Hey! Hey! Now tell me, sir. Is it right to remove my eyes or not? It took time for me to believe what you said. How will they believe you so easily? Look! You shouldn't take a rash decision in this matter. Come and meet me tomorrow. Then we will talk. There's no talking, sir. Just do as I say. Where do you stay? MVP Complex. - I will drop you home. No, sir. I will go. Bye, sir. What is it, doctor? Why did you suddenly think of me? I need to talk to you about Gautham. He is crazy. What is there to talk about him? We have to talk. If a person suddenly starts behaving.. ..like a crazy man, there will be a strong reason for it. Do you know the reason for Gautham's craziness? A spirit. Yes, he can really see a spirit. How can he see a spirit? That's foolish. You studied science, do you believe this? Yes. Because science has no answers for many questions. What do you actually know about Gautham? If he is not seeing a spirit.. ..how does he know so much about Kulakarni? Why would he want to appear like a fool before you.. ..by saying that he can see a spirit? That's true. Without realizing that you insulted him.. ..by calling him a mad man. You forbid him from seeing your daughter. He doesn't want his eyesight if he can't see your daughter.. ..so he came to me to get his eyes removed. Oh. He didn't do a single mistake on his own till now. That spirit made him do those things. Hello! - Gautham, I have good news for you. What is that, sir? Your father in law is a close friend to me. I spoke to him. You don't have to get your eyes removed now. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. You will gain your love now. Thank you, sir. Thank you. "Mind-blowing, baby! Mind-blowing!" "Your super-duper glamour is mind-blowing." "Let's meet. Come, let's date." "Let's skip the theories and start practicing our love." "..where is your waist, my darling?" "..where is your waist, my darling?" "Whether it is tiny or large, my waist belongs to you." "Handsome is here to play. He is here to hunt at dusk." "He sprayed perfume from Gulf." "He has jasmines wrapped around his wrists." "Handsome is here to play. He is here to hunt at dusk." "He sprayed perfume from Gulf." "He has jasmines wrapped around his wrists." "I'll become a cell phone and pinch your chubby cheeks." "If you touch me, I'll come to life like a touch-screen." "I will come like Rambo, filled with energy from Red Bull.." "..and enjoy all your beauty to my satisfaction." "I'll wait for you and welcome you.." "..I'll give you green signals all your way." "Handsome is here to play. He is here to hunt at dusk." "He sprayed perfume from Gulf." "He has jasmines wrapped around his wrists." "Handsome is here to play. He is here to hunt at dusk." "He sprayed perfume from Gulf." "He has jasmines wrapped around his wrists." "Your beautiful body is like a tsunami filled with fire." "The man inside is you is my sweet enemy." "Every day spent with you is like a carnival, Baby Doll." "I want to have candle light dinners with you." "Having fun with you adds spice to my life." "I want you to play Candy Crush with my beauty." "Handsome is here to play. He is here to hunt at dusk." "He sprayed perfume from Gulf." "He has jasmines wrapped around his wrists." "Handsome is here to play. He is here to hunt at dusk." "He sprayed perfume from Gulf." "He has jasmines wrapped around his wrists." Hey! You don't worry. I'll take care. Ranjith Kulakarni is an industrialist? What is this? Hey, stop the car. Please come. Excuse me. - Yes? Is he not a journalist? You are mistaken. He is a famous businessman. A businessman? As a journalist, I wanted to expose his crimes. Then, who are they? They are his family members. Family members? I'm a bachelor. Last month, while returning from abroad.. ..he died of a heart attack. Heart attack? 'He died in an accident.' Okay, thank you. 'Something is wrong.' The number you are calling is switched off. - Darn! Where do you stay? MVP Complex. - Driver, take me to MVP Complex. How dare you kill our Kashi! Bring him down. We found Kulakarni, boss. Who are you? Why did you target me? I have nothing against you, sir. I'm just a radio jockey, sir. I don't have the means to fight against you. That spirit is making me do these things, sir. Boss, he has been telling the same story to us. He won't tell us the truth. Kill him! Sir! Sir! Sir! I'm innocent, sir. Please, sir. That spirit made me do it. I really don't know anything. No, sir. I beg of you. I don't know anything, sir. I'm innocent, sir. Please let me go, sir. - Kill him! Hey! Hey! Hey, no! No! Don't kill him! Who are you? Are you a policeman? Are you a gangster? Enemy. Enemy? I'm your enemy. I killed Kashi. You are dead. You said there is a spirit. Spirit my foot. I came to kill you. I'm going to get you out of jail. I stole the file too. And I'm going to finish you tomorrow. This is my plan. What is your enmity with me? You will find out. You will find out before you die. 'So, there is no spirit. What he told me is a lie.' Welcome. Just a little. - You came at the right time. Gautham, he is my best friend. - Hello, sir. Without knowing that, you went to him.. ..to get your eyes removed. 'He knows everything. You and I are fools.' Thanks, uncle. I gained my love because of you. I'm glad. I don't know how I can ever repay you, sir. It is good that you don't know. What's wrong? Nothing. No, don't sit there. Why? - Mr. Kulakarni is sitting there. Yes, sir. He is sitting there. He is not sitting in that chair, is he? - No, sir. Come, brother. Sit here. Whose plate is this? Kulakarni brother's plate. I never thought you will take my words so seriously. What are you saying, sir? He is your childhood friend. Your words are a law to him. 'Is that why you used me?' This has been possible only because of you, sir. I couldn't have achieved it without your support. Hey, I didn't support any of your deeds. Are you plotting to frame me for the murders you do? Why are you so frustrated? He is talking about his love. Yeah, right. I know what he's saying. Son, ask Mr. Kulakarni if he wants yogurt. Okay. He is still enjoying his lentil soup so he wants some clarified butter. Put some clarified butter. Hey, you.. You ask what you want. Okay, sir. Eat, son. I have a stomach upset. 'He has the whole family fooled.' Son! I have to talk to you in private. Will you come out? Yeah, sure. What did you want to talk to me, sir? Kulakarni, he wants to talk to me in private. You go down. I will kill you if you continue this drama before me. You created a non-existent spirit and fooled me. Who are you? Why did you do all this? I didn't do it for myself, sir. I did it for my friends. Only three children will get eyes during this camp. Raju. Kiran. Divya. Yeah! My friends will be able to see! What are you talking about? - Yes.. ..if you don't get eyes, we don't want them too. That's it. You don't want them? - No. We want to see the world if you can see it too. Will you spend all your lives without eyesight? Yes, we will. I will get new eyes sooner or later. And even if I don't get eyes, you all can take care of me. I bind you by oath to accept those eyes. Post! Post? Father, is there a letter from my friends? Nothing for you, son. 'I waited for their letters and phone calls and became sad.' 'But one day..' Son, you have letters from your friends. Yeah! 'But after that I didn't get any letters from them for years.' 'But I continued waiting for them.' Father! Is there any letter for me? No, son. They left and forgot about you. You should forget them too. I can't forget them if I'm here, Father. Please send me somewhere far. After I got my eyesight I didn't want to see Nethra or Father. I wanted to see my childhood friends who left me. I wanted to hit them for doing so. And the only thing that can lead me to them.. ..was the letters they wrote me when we were children. Where are the postal stamps on them? Who wrote these letters? Did you write them? Will you listen to me first? - I won't. What did you do to my friends? I want to see them right now. You wanted to see them as soon as you got eyesight. They wanted to see you as soon as they opened their eyes. Gautham will be so surprised to meet us, right? Yes. I want to see Gautham too. Hello! - Father, we are almost there. We want to see our friend Gautham first. Don't tell him that we are coming. Come soon. Uncle, what happened? Sir! Sir, get up! Take me away. Otherwise they will.. Uncle! - Uncle! Uncle! Who are you? No, sir. Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Hide. Father! - What happened, dear? Somebody is killing people here, Father. - What? Where are you, dear? Looks like there is a temple here, Father. Please, sir. - Please, leave us. Sir, please. Don't harm us. - Please, sir. Please don't harm us, sir. We are from Sharada Devi Blind School. We got our eyesight just now. We wanted to see our friend Gautham first. So, as soon as you got your eyesight.. ..you saw me killing two men. So, you will never forget this Pantham Babji. But we won't tell anyone, sir. This is the problem with being able to see. You have to see such things and report them to others. Please, sir. Leave us. - Am I right, Kashi? Yes, boss. - Kill them. Please, sir. Please leave us. Please, sir. Don't kill us. Run! Run! Hey! Stop! Hey! Catch them! Run! Get away! Don't get caught. Run. Hello! Father! They killed Raju and Kiran. Killed them? Where are you, dear? Divya! Divya! Kiran! Kiran! Raju! Raju! Raju! Divya! Divya! Search everywhere. Search that side. She is not here. Come on. Let's go. - Let's go. Oh no! Someone is here. Divya! Divya! Father? Fath.. Divya.. She is dead. I'm sure you understood what happened. If you file a complaint with the police.. ..Pantham Babji will kill all the kids in your blind school.. ..and you too. I knew you will be shattered if I tell you that they are dead. I wanted to erase them from your mind.. ..that's why I stopped writing letters to you. Gautham! They didn't want to see if I couldn't see. They wanted to see me first after opening their eyes. If there is anything left for me to do for such dear friends.. ..it is to kill Pantham Babji. Ever since that day, I don't fear death or desire life. I have only one goal, sir. He should die. He should die. But because of my bad luck, he got arrested. I got to know that uncle is preparing a file.. ..to keep him in jail forever. I can't kill him if he is inside. And I have to steal that file in order to get him out of jail. I have to enter that house. The only way I can do that is Nethra. Nethra is the same girl that I loved when I was blind. I felt that God is on my side. But.. Nethra, will you introduce me to your dad? No, I'm scared of my dad. When I was wondering what to do next.. ..I remembered Kulakarni, the man who gave me his eyes. I found out this truth because you gave me your eyes. I need your help to do justice to that truth, sir. Your spirit will be with me from now. I'm going to pretend that it is with me. I had to become mad in order to fool everyone around me. Even Pantham Babji thought Kulakarni is his enemy. Name is Kulakarni. I was doing everything and it was my revenge.. ..but I let Kulakarni take the blame. I entered into this house in the name of that spirit. I stole the file in the name of that spirit. I killed Kashi in the name of that spirit. How did you know about me? My brother. Mother. Grandmother. He is my dad. Who is he? Dr. Ashish uncle. His word is law to my dad. That's when I realized that if I want them to believe.. ..that the spirit is beside me, I have to convince you first. You are too smart. Do you think you can kill Pantham Babji with this plan? Hey, Gautham! - And.. Yes, sir. He is getting released tomorrow. If you want Kulkarni's soul to rest in peace and.. ..if you want him to leave you alone, there's only one way. What is that, sir? Kill Pantham Babji. How can I kill him, sir? Yes, you have to kill him. He is not Gandhi. Kill him. I will take care of the rest. You come with me. Sir, I can't do it. - You are not an ordinary man. Sir! Sir! He gave special discount to you. - He was such an idiot. Hey! Who are you? What are you doing? Nethra! Nethra! Since there is no evidence against him, the court.. ..finds the accused named Pantham Babji not guilty. Hello! - I missed out on entertainment when I was in jail. I found your girl at the correct time. Hey! Hey! - Yes. Come to the old factory in Walthare with that same anger in you. I have some bad news for you. I'm going to kill Kulakarni. You can't. - Why? Because he is already dead. Dead? - You killed him. When did I kill him? Kashi killed him, but he did it for Pantham Babji, that's you. The names match, but the situations don't match. Shut up, you idiot. What are you talking about? If Kashi killed Kulakarni, how can Kulakarni kill Kashi? A person dies but a spirit doesn't die. That's why he got him killed. A spirit? - A spirit? A spirit? Lord Hanuman! Boss, my wife made fish curry today. Can I go to have lunch? - Hey! Yes, the spirit is making him do these things. There is no spirit, sir. It is his imagination. Who is he? Kulkarni's sim card was on his name, sir. Are you Kulkarni's friend? No, sir. I'm Gautham's friend. What about Kulakarni? He is Gautham's friend. So you all are friends, right? No, sir. I'm a visible friend, he is an invisible friend. What are you talking about? I will explain everything clearly to you. This is me. This is you. This is Kashi. This is Gautham. Where is Kulakarni? Kulakarni doesn't exist, sir. Then why are you showing me these fingers? Tell me why he killed my men. Or I will kill you. Who are you talking about? Kulakarni or Gautham? Kulakarni. Kulakarni can't kill, sir. The thing is, Gautham killed Kashi because.. ..Kulakarni asked him to and blamed it on Kulakarni. And you want revenge from Kulakarni for killing Kashi.. ..but you are chasing after Gautham, sir. What are you talking about? You didn't understand? What I said was.. You can't bring back Kashi to life. You want to kill Kulakarni but he doesn't exist. And Gautham who killed him won't come to save me. Without understanding that.. ..if you keep asking me about Kulakarni like a fool.. ..where will I bring him from? Oh God! What are you trying to say? You just killed my buzz. How should I explain it to you? This is all just Gautham's imagination. No, it is a spirit. - No, it is his imagination. Spirit. - Imagination. Calm down. What is all this nonsense? Why are you both fighting like cats and dogs? If you are telling the truth, if that Kulkarni is really.. ..a spirit or just imagination, how could we see him? Did you see him? Show me. Show him. Look at them kissing. He is Gautham, you fool. Ever since he is able to see, he is imagining that.. ..he can see a man named Kulakarni.. ..who wants him to kill all of you. That is not his imagination, it is the truth. Hey, shut up. Does that mean Gautham couldn't see before? No, sir. He grew up in Sharada Devi Blind School. Which school? Sharada Devi Blind School. We are from Sharada Devi Blind School. 'I killed his friends 15 years ago.' 'That's why he targeted me and made this plan.' Gautham! He doesn't know anything. He is innocent. How can you hit a girl? Hey! Get up. Get up. Get up. How dare you kill my men and target me! Before dying, your friends begged me.. ..that they have to see you. But I didn't show mercy. I did a really big mistake by separating you all. I will send you to them now. They will be happy.. ..and you will be happy. You know how I killed your friend Divya? Like this. Like this. I held her head like this.. ..and twisted her throat like a hen's throat and killed her. Hey! Hey! Hey! What is this jumping around in darkness? Maybe he is stronger in darkness.. ..just like a crocodile is stronger in water. I will walk without making noise. I recently admitted my little son in kindergarten. Please leave me. - Call them. What? - Call your men one after the other. Okay. There is no time, my friend. Peace or war? His time came to an end. 'Let's do bashing up.' He bashed him up. 'Tell me, boys!' 'What to do, what not to do?' - This phone will be my death. Hey! Hey! Hey! Where are you? Hey! Hey! I will kill you! Hey! Show yourself! Hey! Did my friends plead you in the same way? No. - We were born in darkness.. ..we ate in darkness and we walked in darkness. We lived with the hope that we'll see the world one day. If we had known that there are monsters like you.. ..in this world, we wouldn't have wished for eyes. We would've wanted to stay in that darkness. They wanted to see me first when they got their eyesight. So you saw how much they loved me. Now you have to see how much I love them. No, don't shoot. Don't kill me. No matter what you say, I can't do it, Kulakarni. I can't kill him. - Who are you talking to? No, sir. Please, sir. I can't kill him. Listen to me. Do as Kulakarni said. No, sir. No, sir. - I will take care of the rest. I can't do it, sir. - Hey, crazy man! What are you saying to him? - Shoot him. I can't do it, sir. - Hey! Finally you turned me into a murderer. Are you happy? Sir, arrest me. Please, sir. No. This is not your fault. Tell me where is Kulkarni's spirit. Where? 'He is a bigger fool than me.' Hey, Kulakarni! Your work is done, right? Now go. Go. Don't torture my son in law. Go. Will you go or not? Shoot.. Do you want me to shoot? Sir! Sir, Kulakarni is leaving after your warning. 'He started it again.' - He is leaving. Sir, he is thanking us for helping him. Sir, he is saying bye to us. - Say bye to him. Bye. - Bye. - Fools! Sir, there is no spirit. Who are you waving to? How can you say that when we can see him? See there! There! Say bye! Wave your hand. - Bye. Bye. Gautham, come here. - Bye. I've seen men who leave their parents after getting wives.. ..and men who leave friends after getting lovers. But you did all this for your dead friends. I like you. I can see the spirit that I created? Imagination. It's all in my imagination. Are you done with your jokes? I will slap you! So you are a spi.. I'm a spirit. The same spirit that you used like a credit card. I broke the new tiles on my grave and came here.. ..because I couldn't bear to see your crimes. What did I do, sir? What did you do? You have my eyes. You committed murders on my name.. ..and fooled the policemen. You will pay for it. I used my brain, sir. I didn't use you. This is the first time that I'm seeing your spirit. So you think you killed Babji without my help? Go back two reels. If I hadn't saved you like that, you would've been sleeping.. ..in a grave beside me instead of sleeping on this bed. Is that so? Thank you, sir. Keep that to yourself. I'm saying that I can't repay you in this life. No. You have to repay me in this very life. How? I didn't die of a heart attack as everyone thinks. It was a pre-planned murder. Murder? - Yes. They deceived me in a business deal and killed me. He is a big don in Dubai, his name is Jaffar Khan. So? You have to murder him. Another murder? Looks like you are in a good mood. Very stiff. 'Not stiff. I gave him such a big shock..' '..that he can't consummate his marriage for a year.' "Handsome is here to play. He is here to hunt at dusk." "He sprayed perfume from Gulf." "He has jasmines wrapped around his wrists." "Handsome is here to play. He is here to hunt at dusk." "He sprayed perfume from Gulf." "He has jasmines wrapped around his wrists."
