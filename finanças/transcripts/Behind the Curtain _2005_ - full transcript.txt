Hello, is that you, brother? - Yes. Yes, Meera, tell me. Yes. Okay. Done with your work? - I'm still at it. What time will you all leave? - Around.. An hour or so. - Hang on! Hang on. Hey! Rascal. What the heck is going on? Your work is pending since yesterday. How long will it take you? Hey brother! Stop it! Who are you talking to? Are you not taking it seriously? - Brother? Finish off the work in an hour. Or else.. Y-yes. I'll fix it soon. Will do it for sure. - Yes, Meera, carry on. Yes. Yes. Everything else is fine, but when will you reach the station? I'll be there on time for sure. Yes, I asked Siddhartha to take a day off. Yes. Hey listen.. Listen, where's my sister? - She's besides me. Pass the phone to her. Yes. Hold a Second. Here you go. Yes. - Meera. Hey, are you done with the breakfast? Hi, Meera. Tell me. - Sister. What will be the color of your sari? Red. I am wearing the same color sari. No, listen. Change and wear some other color. - Why? I told you once and that's final. Is that clear? Pass the phone to brother-in-law. Brother-in-law? Yes, what is it? - It's Meera on the line. Oh. Yes, tell me. No, I had a word with him before. Yes, we'll give you a call before leaving. Yes. I spoke to him an hour ago. Meet me at the station. Hey listen! I hope you remember what time the train arrives. Yes. It's all right. Hold on, I'll give it to her. Sheba. - Yes. It's Meera on the line. Hello? Yes Meera, tell me. What are you going to wear? I mean, are you wearing a sari or 'salvar'? Of course, I'll wear a sari. - Wear a purple one then. And listen. Don't wear anything red. When I say anything it's carved in stone. I hope you'll remember. Pass the phone to brother. Yes, I'll do that. Brother? - Yes, sister-in-law. Come in. It's Meera on the line. - Oh yes, give it to me. Yes, Meera. Tell me. Yes, we are ready. I'm worrying about your husband. Yes, I will. Don't mess around this time. You guys mess up things once everything is set. Look. You'll end up in trouble, if you mess up again this time. Yes. All right, I'll hang up now. What is this? Why aren't you ready yet? Are you leaving for work? Aren't you coming with us? This means.. This means, you're still holding grudges against.. You had promised me. I'll be there on time. Inspector General is coming for a visit today. I'll come once the inspection is done. What's the matter? Pick up the call. It might be your father's call. Go on. Perhaps you aren't finished chatting. Pick it up. I feel.. Why to worry? Pick up the call. Oh no! Go! The ball has landed into the prison. Sir! - Sir! The ball... has gone inside mistakenly. It won't be possible to get the ball without your help, sir. You always come up with a new problem every day, don't you? Please, sir. Spare us for the last time. Take this and buy a new ball. - No, sir. Don't act smart. Take it. Thank you, sir! - Now leave. Come on! - Come on. Who hit me? Shankar! Rascal! You're such a mischievous boy. You want to spoil your reputation, don't you? Is this you're supposed to be doing after a gap of three days? I'll tear off your ears! You'll be expelled from the school. Come on. I'll complaint to your uncle today. Did you realize it today that Shankar is not interested in studies and other activities? Deal your cards. I was thinking if you could pay attention to him.. Me? Why should I? Because you're his uncle. Idiot! - Oh! Why me? Did I ask his father to breed so many kids in a jiffy? Did I have a special interest to become his uncle? It's your fault. What will I do? Will I teach the children in the school? What kind of lessons you teach that the students fail to understand? Uncle! It's your fault.. Hey, come on! What are you saying? My fault, is it? Then whose fault is it? Do you have an idea about my expenses? - No. You know how much do I spend? And you deny it's not your fault. It's like the thief blaming the cop. And.. I mean.. I.. I mean. I can agree with you if you're willing to pay me. What do you mean? It's in your pocket! Come on! - Hey! What are you doing? Let go of your hands. What are you doing? You may leave now. It's fun, isn't it? Come on, leave. - What did you just do? You want me to take the rest of your money? Oh, no. Go! Go away. Get away from me. Come on, go! - What about the money.. Will you get lost? - Ye.. my.. Leave! - Okay.. Leave! I don't have money. What should I do now? Oh God! As you sow, so shall you reap. Don't give promises you can't keep. When you keep your ego on all your money is gone. You rascal! - Shall I call my uncle? No. Where there is so much of darkness? If you work.. What's that? Everything seems so nice and calm in the dark. If you work it's nice. "Why me.. why.." Here you go. You think this is enough? Will this clear the pending dues? If we don't pay them this month, they will.. This is not enough! That's enough, I guess. - How's that possible? Bring down the expenses. I have no more money. - You never have it anyway! What about the money you blow on booze and gambling? You're a curse! You can borrow from your brother-in-law. He won't refuse you. I feel heavenly when I drink. And what can I say about gambling? I don't play it for my sake. I play to live. That's all for livelihood. That's how it works. It's all money. I do a lot to provide for you. You're equally responsible to do the same. At least, do something. - Why should I? I'm helpless. I have to spend all the money on you. What's the use of sending that rascal to school? I've told you several times to let him earn rather than sitting at home. Can't you do that? Yes, that's true. Little boy. My good boy. You didn't go to school since three days. I spoke to your teacher today. Where do you roam if you don't go to school? I've been noticing this since a while now. Why don't you answer me? Hey! Hey, you notorious boy. Can you hear me? Hey! You're living a luxurious life with my money, aren't you? Why didn't you go to school? Tell me, why didn't you? Your teacher came to me and.. Enough of studying. Quit. Give it to me. I'll burn all your books. Give it to me. I'll burn them all. Henceforth you won't go to school. I won't spare you if I see you studying. We'll provide for you only if you earn. Nothing else to do. Burn them all! Burn them! Burn it all. Get out of my way. Come on, move. Move! Get aside. Move aside! Stop! Hey kids, don't get off the car till I come. A cup of tea, please. Don't give it away. Get rid of me! - I beg you, brother. Get away! - Please.. I beg you. Your rent is pending since seven months. I'll kick you out today. - No. Go away! No! Please don't do this. Get away! - Where will I go now? Go! Get away. - No! My books! Get away! - My books! He threw my books away, mother. - Get out! Go! Mother! Mother! He threw away my books. Get away! Get away. Mother, all my books are thrown away. I'll help you get the bag down. No, that's okay. - We'll handle it. Don't worry. Grandma. - Yes. Uncle doesn't seem to take care of you. There's no one to take care of them too. From now on, they'll stay with you. Is it so? Welcome, my dear. Such a sweet girl. What's your name? - Koli. Such a beautiful name. Get side! Hey Ruby, don't you want to go to school? Hey, mom's calling me. I'll get ready for school. Mom, I'll go to school. I'll go to school, mom. Mom, listen to me! I'll go to school. Everybody goes. I'll go too. - Shut up! No need to go. Help me do household chores. We can't even buy food and you want to go to school! What happened, dear? Why are you crying? No, baby. Don't cry. The girl wants to go to school. Why wouldn't you let her go? You don't take her side. All of you get in the car. What's wrong? Why are you crying, Koli? Do you want to know why? She's making excuses to go to school. Then admit her to the school. - What about expenses? I am there for it. 5 into 1 is 5. 5 into 1 is 5. 5 into 2 is 10. 5 into 2 is 10. 5 into 3 is 15. 5 into 3 is 15. 5 into 4 are... - Master! She's my friend and she wants admission in your school. A friend? This school is not a street market. Not anyone can come and go according to their own wishes. Not possible. Get away. So you won't admit her, right? - No! Fine! I'll call my uncle then. Hey! - Shall I? Girl, come and sit over here. Her name is Koli. Do you want to have a walk down the valley? No, I don't. Look at that balloon. Oh no! Hey, Shankar! Shankar! Shankar! Shankar! Shankar. "Koli!" "Koli!" "Koli!" "Come all my friends, here we go." "Round and round, here we go." "A king wished for a beautiful daughter like you.." "King wished for a girl like you." "He wished for a girl named Koli." "For whom he finds are very few" "running down the dream and here we go." "Come, all my friends, here we go." "Round and round here we go." "The king wished for a beautiful daughter like you." "As we ride on the horses" "we feel the raindrops on our hair." "As we ride on the horses" "and you feel the raindrops on your hair." "You cough and you sneeze" "so you fall off your knees." "As we ride on the horses" "and you feel the raindrops on your hair." "You cough and sneeze" "so you fall off your knees." "The king wished for a daughter like you." "King wished for a girl named Koli." "For whom he finds are very few" "running down the dream and here we go." "Come, all my friends, here we go." "Round and round here we go." "The king wished for a daughter like you." "So cute and sweet you are." "Just like a beautiful fish." "So cute and sweet you are." "Just like a beautiful fish." "You swim and scatter your fins." "King wished for a daughter like you." "Wished for a girl named Koli." "For whom he finds are very few." "Running down the dream and here we go." "Here we go.." "Koli!" "Koli!" Koli. Listen. This is for you. Keep it. What's the time? It's 4 o'clock. 4 o'clock? Give it to me. The old lady and the girl. Both of them are trying to brainwash Shankar's mind. He is capable enough now. I tried my best to convince him. He should earn well and look after us. I hope so. - Why not? I need all his money for my retirement. Hey listen, long time no see. I need 200 rupees from you. Not possible. Not possible? What does that mean? Give it to me if you want to stay here. Where do you spend all your money then? What did you say? - Give me some water. Give my boy something to eat. Give me some water too. In this era of freedom we've been through a lot of ups and downs. Tonight we celebrate the auspicious of 'Shivratri'. We've planned out something special. The event will start from today itself. I request all of you to grace us with your presence. This time, I'll be celebrating, 'Shivratri'. How will that benefit you? I'll be fasting in the name of Lord Shankar. I am not God. - I know you are not God. You are a modern Lord Hanuman. I toil the entire day and night for a single penny. And you.. You don't even bother. I can't take it anymore. What happened? Make her understand. I can't take much stress at this age. She's wasting money for no reason. I've had a hard time making a living. I'll need a big house for her. Koli is growing up. You both stay and share everything together. This doesn't look good, right? If we don't find a house.. What did Koli demand? She wants a new sari for Lord Shiva's veneration. I told her. I can't afford. Am I here to fulfill her useless demands? Come on, study. Power is back on. Where is she? Who? Mom? She's gone to the market. - You're home alone. I've bought something for you. Take this. A sari for you. Did I ask you to get it for me? You didn't say it, but I followed my heart. Keep this and wear it. I'm leaving. Listen. I won't wear it. I won't, I won't. - I'll come later. Wear it. I won't wear it. Idiot. Hey, how about a glass of cannabis? Take this. Drink it. Good. When will she come? One more glass please. You'll get a good husband and lead a comfortable life. He'll hail from the city and take you away. He'll marry and take her away. That's all crap. Let's go. People talk nonsense. - Too much! God bless her. Why did you bring me here? I wanted to give you something. - Now what? Hold on. Oh my God! An anklet? I always wanted to wear this. How did you know about it? I remember everything since childhood. Come on, put it on. You put this on me. Me? - Yes. Koli! Study. Study seriously. Why did you stop studying? Should I tell mom about it? - Yes. I'm studying geometry. What is this? Triangle. - What? I thought this is a paddle. Idiot! That's why I tell you to study. You're studying, aren't it? That's enough for me. Oh no! - Oh no! We're having a power cut again. It's enough now. I don't like it. Why so? - There's no kerosene. Two more chapters are still pending. What will I do now? I have a test tomorrow. I am messed up. - Hold a second. Don't worry. Relax. I'll do something. Come on, study. Hmm. Oh God! What happened? Oh God! The chain is broken. Are you done with your studies? - No. Stay. I'll be back in a while. Where are you going? "You can be a bird" "if you want to." "Crossing many miles" "in search of food." "You can fly" "in the clear blue skies." "Between these clouds" "we get lost somewhere." "Beyond this.." "Life" "with the presence of God." "I want both of us" "to get lost into each other." "You know where?" "Very far." "You can be a bird" "if you want to." "Crossing many miles" "in search of food." "You can fly" "in the clear blue skies." "Between these clouds" "we get lost somewhere." "Why to worry?" "Keep the trust alive.' "That's what my heart says." "Come here, rest your head and listen." "I am living a happy life" "in your arms." "I sacrifice myself to you." "Beyond this.." "Life" "with the presence of God." "I want both of us" "to get lost into each other." "Getting lost in your world." "I feel the same." "You can be a bird" "if you want to." "Crossing many miles" "in search of food." "You can fly" "in the clear blue skies." "Between these clouds" "we get lost somewhere." "On the trail of life and death" "peace and harmony" "everything that I got is your heart." "I can defeat death" "no matter what happens." "If you're with me" "I am all yours." "Beyond this.." "Life" "with the presence of God." "I want both of us" "to get lost into each other." "Getting lost in your world is what I feel." "I feel the same." "You can be a bird" "if you want to." "Crossing many miles" "in search of food." "You can fly" "in the clear blue skies." "Between these clouds, let's get lost somewhere." Take this. Shankar is here. Mind your own business. A cup of tea please. Why isn't Koli going to school? I asked her. She didn't reply and went inside. She has exams today and hence.. What's the matter? - No need to send her to school. It's enough. I am planning to get her married. But Koli isn't ready for it. She wants to continue learning. I've found a good match for her. Lives across the village. For her wellbeing. She'll be happy there. I will! What did you say? Hey! Yes! Destroy everything. I won't listen to you no matter what. Remember this. Look what's happening. How can you do this to her in my presence? I will.. I'll go report to the police. Yes, sure. Go and get the police. Let me see what can the police do. Koli is mine. Only mine. Hey Shankar. Shankar? Why are you running behind that lady? Forget dreaming about Koli. Hey.. No! No. Spare me! Sister! The cops are going to arrest Shankar. You must come with me right now. Let's go. Put him in the jeep. Come on. Get going. I'm glad the police arrested him. That'll teach him a good lesson. Shankar! Shankar! Shankar! Shankar! Shankar! Shankar! Sir, please. "Sing with me all" "in thousand voice." What's the matter? Why are you standing over here? I've run out of flour. Run out of flour.. - Yes! You're finished too. - What? I'll beat you up till you drop dead. I'll make you run in the morning and starve you. Don't you have work? Come on, move. Talk less, work more. "Sing with me.." Ball! Where did this come from? Sir, will you give me my ball back? So that was you, Shankar. What's going on? Play time, is it? Everyone is busy working on such a hot and a sunny day. You're playing with ball. Where did you find it? Come on, tell me. Where did you find it? I don't know who gave me this. I was lying down dreaming about Koli. Koli? Who is she? What are you saying, sir? You don't know who Koli is. - No. Then it's going to be a tricky situation. Tricky? Why so? Do you know the consequences when Koli files an appeal for my bail but you don't seem to recognize her? Oh my goodness. What are you saying? I'm sure Koli is an influential person. Shankar. - Yes. Does she know you well? - Yes, she does. She loves me a lot. 'Something is wrong.' Why can't I recall her.. - What happened? I can't recall. Who is Koli? She's my beautiful moon, sir. Koli is my life. Koli dwells in my heart. - Hey! Are you trying to fool me? Are you? - Yes. Are you? I will beat you up real bad I'll make you run in the morning and starve you. Why? Look up. - What's that? Keep looking. You'll find it. Hey! Hey! Hold on! Hold on! I won't spare you. - Hey, Mr. Gorongo. Sir. - Are you supposed to play with a ball on duty? No... no, sir, it's not me.. it's him. Hey! Tell him what you were doing. Come on, tell him! Tell him it was you playing with the ball. Me? You can see how busy I am working here. He insisted me to play with him since morning. What nonsense! You tell me. Will I work or will I play? No, sir, he is lying.. Mr. Gorongo, IG sir is about to come. Are the arrangements done? - Yes sir, it's done. Jail premises has been cleaned. The stage is ready. Some minor arrangements are ongoing.. Everything is pending. Finish it fast. - Yes, sir. I'll tear your ears off. Dare you do this to me. - Mr. Gorongo? Yes, sir. It's Meera's call. Tell her, I am busy. Hello? Hello? Hello? Yes. Hello, madam. Tell me. Who.. No. No. Sir is very busy. Yes he is so busy. I can't tell you how busy he is. I mean absolutely busy. No time at all. He won't be able to talk to you. It will take a very long time. Gorongo, I know how busy he is. Stop lying and hand over the phone to him. Tell him it's very urgent. Just a minute, madam. Sir. - Yes. Sir.. Sir, it's an emergency call. It's madam on the line. She wants to talk. Let's go, boy. Hello! - What time you were supposed to come? I told you I am busy. No. I don't want to hear any excuses. Brother has already left. I want you here right now. That's it. We need to look back into our previous era. The land of peace and non-violence. They have to live a beautiful and healthy life. The circumstances that arose today is the inaccuracy of human. To rectify this mistake we are with you. We have with us, Jailer Siddhartha. I knew about this idea in detail. I am happy. I'll be with you. Hello. - Has Siddhartha come? What happened? Has he not come yet? You guys carry on. I won't be able to make it. Are you serious? This isn't possible. The same story again. That's not done. Hang up. I'll talk to Siddhartha. Hello? - Siddhartha. Are you not home yet? Listen. The way you mistreat my sister won't be tolerated. You have to pay for it. No excuses. Rush home right now. We'll be waiting for you at the station. There's a ceremony going on. I'll talk to you later. Sir. - Yes? Let's distribute the sweets. - Okay. Mr. Gorongo. - Yes, sir. Yes sir, it's ready. Please come. Come along, sir. - Let's go. Over here. Brother. - Yes. I won't spare Siddhartha if he cancels the meeting this time. Thank you, sir. - All right. Are you done? - Oh! No, sir. My wife loves sweet so.. Someone had left this a box of sweets here. So I thought of taking this along. How will you grow in life if you don't eat? Yes, sir. Anyway. I need to rush. I have to take my wife somewhere. Got it? Sir, prisoner number 38 has run away. Shankar. - What? You have to come immediately, sir. Hey. Who witnessed Shankar running away? What did you all see? What did you see? Answer me! - Nothing! You won't say a word, right? Will you? What did you see? What did you see? - No! No. Come on, say it! - No.. I didn't see anything, sir. - You didn't, right? Why didn't you people notice anything? You didn't see him, too. Move! Hey! Come here. Speak up! You were there. I'm very sure, you were with him. - No.. No, sir. I have no idea about him. - Open up! No, sir. Speak up! - Officer! They won't say a word if you beat them up so mercilessly. Unless I take action, they won't say a word, sir. Hold on. I'll take care of this. Leave him. Do you know anything? - No, sir. I don't know anything, sir. - All right. Come here. Do you know anything? - No, sir. Sir, I wasn't present with Shankar. There.. They were with him. They were having a good time chatting away. No, sir. I... don't know anything. I don't know anything. - Don't be afraid. Tell me. - No, no.. Sir. - Yes. Tell me. I came to know.. You don't look like someone who lived in a city. I live in Dinpur.. - Oh. Hill station. Why are you here? For Koli. - That's it. That's all he said, sir. Officer? - Sir. Note down everyone's statement. All right, sir. - Inform the staff to meet me right away. - Okay, sir. Gorongo, come along. - Sir. Hey! Come on, move. Move it! Shankar was jailed for two days as Dinpur police station was under renovation. I know.. - How will the IG react now? Before the ceremony began, someone visited Shankar. Prisoner number 38. - Yes. Any details about the visitor? A kid called Shona. Do you know Koli is getting married? That's why I've come here. You can leave. The details are right here, sir. The boy had come from Dinpur. Shankar's hometown is Dinpur too. That means.. Wherever I look, I see a mess. Hey, what's taking you so long? - We're almost done. Why are you wasting so much time? Get away from here. Move on. - Rascals. Idiots! What are you doing up there? We aren't finished with the decorations yet. Oh, I see. Okay. All right, hurry up! Make it quick. Hey! - Yes, sir? Where are you taking this? What is this? This has to be kept separately for IG sir. I see. What are you doing? Too much of sweet isn't good for anyone's health. Go, move on. - All right. Sir! Sir! Sir. - What's the matter? Sir. Look at that. My God! Hello? Yes, sir. - So Siddhartha I hope the ceremony went smoothly yesterday. - Yes, sir. Everything's perfectly alright. But there's a problem. One of the prisoners ran away from the jail. - What? The one whom we got from Dinpur that prisoner.. - He ran away, did he? Do you know what an issue the media will create if they learn about this news? Ridiculous! The entire staff is been monitoring 50 prisoners. You're right, sir. The staff are sincere indeed. But I have no idea how no one noticed. Actually sir, everyone was busy at the ceremony. We've allotted enough security personnel for you whenever needed. Sorry, sir, it's my mistake. Sir, if you grant me 24 hours I'll surely catch that prisoner. I give you my word, sir. - Okay. You have only 24 hours. I want that prisoner to be caught within 24 hours. Otherwise I can take a strict action against you. I promise I'll get hold of the prisoner within 24 hours. It's my responsibility, sir. Oh no! The road is closed. Dinpur is quite far from here, sir. How will we reach there? There's no petrol station anywhere ahead. We'll take lot of time to reach. - I know. We should've informed Dinpur police earlier. They would've done some arrangements. The news will spread if we inform anyone. The media will get the hint of it. I've got only 24 hours. I have to get this done. Come on, let's take the bus. - What? Drop the bike to my place. - All right, sir. Check out the departure time for the bus to Dinpur. Yes, sir. - Done. Yes, tell me. - Tell me one thing. Are we going or not? If it isn't possible then what will I.. - Meera. Listen to me. One prisoner has escaped from the jail. It's very important to get hold of him. I don't want to hear anything. Tell me, when are you coming? Meera, please listen to me. Listen, the IG has given me just 24 hours to get hold of him. Do I have any time? Please try to understand. Tell me, when will you come home? Meera, try to understand. I'll lose my job if I fail to catch the convict. When are you coming home? All right. All right. Okay. Listen. Do one thing. You carry on, all right? I'll make sure I'll go there after I do my work. Will you be coming or not? You have to.. You have to come anyhow. You have to be here. You have to be here. You are worrying for no reason. You may carry on. I'll explain your brother everything. I'll do it right away. Danganj! Danganj! Hello, brother? - Yes, Siddhartha. Yeah, tell me. Listen. Where are you? First tell me, when are you coming? Hey, let me handle him. Give me the phone. Siddhartha, I can't tolerate this every day. I am telling you nicely to come to the station right now. Listen, I won't be able to come. Meera will be coming alone. I've told her. Sir, Dinpur's last bus has departed. There's only one bus going to Danganj in a while. But sir, Dinpur is quite far away from.. Let's go, move on. Hey, stop. Stop! Come on. Okay! Come on, get down. We have reached Danganj. Yes, get down. This is the last stop. He might know something. Hey, mister. - Yes. How far is Dinpur from here? Dinpur is too far from here. There's no vehicle to take you there. There's a jungle back there. Over there. - What are you saying? What's in the jungle? Sir, it's quite unsafe to go there. We can leave tomorrow morning. Give me a bottle of water. - Yes, sure. Yes. Do you have a kerchief? - Yes. Give me. Come on, let's go. Sir, are we seriously going through the jungle? Sir, is it necessary? This is not done. This jungle gets dark in the evening. How about tomorrow, sir? Jungle is quite dangerous, sir. No one can predict what might come our way. Come along with me. - Y.. yes, sir. You.. sir.. You're not getting it, sir. It's going to be quite risky. What will happen if you tie this with the stick? May God bless. Hello! Who is it? Yes, dear wife. Yes, tell me. What? You didn't get the sweets? What can I do? I've been so busy with work. I'll get you another one. We all got our share. What else? Let's see. I was thinking.. Oh! My God! 'Best Wishes for the Wedding' Koli! Koli! Open the door! Open the door! Koli, open the door. Open the door! I won't open the door! Open the door! - I won't open the door. Open the door! Koli! Koli, I am back. Koli, I'm here. Koli! Open the door, Koli. I am here, Koli. Shankar! - Open the door. Open the door! Or else I'll break open the door. Open the door! Shankar! - Hey. Koli! Open the door. I'll set the house ablaze. I'll set the house ablaze. Mom! This room.. Koli. - Mom! I'll set this room on fire. - Koli! Mom! - I will set this room on fire. What you do think? I won't let you take my daughter away. Mom.. - I'll break the door. Leave Koli alone! Shankar. Go away from here. - Koli. Go away or else I'll set this room on fire. - Koli! If you as much as harm a hair on Koli's head I swear I won't spare you.. Koli. Koli! Koli. - Shankar! Koli, I've come. No one can take you away from me. No one, Koli! I can hear some creepy sounds, sir. What can it be? Sir, it would have been better if both of us stayed at the bus station. What if something catches us in the jungle at this hour? Can both of us keep the job if the criminal is not caught? To hell with the job. My life is more important than this job. Nothing to worry. Come. How can I tackle such a situation? Gorongo! What's wrong? Did something bite you? What? - Tiger! Tiger? Where is it? Behind me. It's only a picture. Not a real tiger. Yes, it's not a tiger. Just a picture of it. Oh God, you saved my life. Come with me. - Wait, sir. What's the matter now? - Where are you heading, sir? Actually, this place.. this place stinks. I don't know what it is. Something like urine. It's coming from your pants. I guess it's gone now. How long shall we walk? Sir, don't walk so fast. Koli! Koli. Koli! How long will we be walking, sir? We might end up going nowhere. Sir, there are two roads. How do we know which way goes to Dinpur? Nothing is written here too. I have an idea. - Yes, sir. Go and ask that person. The locals might know something. - Okay. How are you, mister? - Yes? Do you know Shankar? Do I know Shankar? My name is Shankar. Tell me. No, not you. You don't have Koli in your life. Koli? You won't get it here. Everything except it. - Koli is not a vegetable. Where is Dinpur? - Dinpur? Yes. - Go this way. Take a left. - Yes. Put the tomato down. What happened? - Nothing, sir. Idiot. Freshen up and wear this sari. Wear it right away. I won't wear it. I said I don't want to get married. I love Shankar. I won't marry anyone else, but him. You've become so audacious. I chose an educated man because I want you to live happily. And you're doing this for a beggar.. You forgot something. The same beggar helped us get a shelter here. He is the reason behind everything you've got. Shame! That's so selfish of you. What? I'm doing this for your wellbeing and you.. I won't spare you today. If you don't listen to me I'll.. - What? What will you do? Set me on fire? Do it. Go ahead. Even then you can't keep me away from Shankar. You won't listen, won't you? - No! You won't? You won't listen to me. Koli. Koli. Koli, open the door. Koli, Koli.. - You won't listen? You won't listen? - No! What? You won't listen? - No! I won't spare you if you hurt Koli. Open the door. - Won't you listen? You won't listen to me? - No! Wear it! Wear it. Hey! Leave Koli alone. Koli! Wear this sari. Wear it! - I won't. Wear it! - No way. Listen to me. - I won't. Open the door. - Hey! Koli, open the door. Open the door. Hey! Open the door. I said, open the door. Open that door! I'll break the door open. What's the matter? What's wrong here? What happened? You want to know what happened. Get away from here. I am warning all of you. - What do you mean? Everyone, get away! Make a move! What are you staring at? Get away! Come. Come inside. Come inside. - Hey! Go away! Don't listen to this jerk. Please come in. Shankar! Shankar. - Koli! Koli, are you fine? I am all right, Shankar. Get away from her. Leave Koli alone. Leave! - I won't. Leave her! Come down! Hey! Leave her. Why are you standing here? Go away! This marriage won't take place. I said it and that's final. - Oh no! Did you invite us to disgrace us? No wonder why the girl is still unmarried. Hey, come on, let's go. - Please wait. Don't go. Shameful! - Please don't go. Please don't go. I beg you. - Come on. Come. Sister! Please don't go. Please.. Leave it. Let her do what she wants. Let's go. We need to rush. Come. Hey! "You can be a bird" "if you want to." "Crossing many miles" "in search of food" "You can fly if you want to" "in the clear blue skies." "Between these clouds" "we get lost somewhere." We made it finally. Where shall we head now? Wherever you take. - Will you come to my house in Kolkata? Will you? - Yes. Hey! Come on. Come. Run, Koli. Come on! Gorongo. - Yes, sir. Shankar! Stop! Stop. Hey! You want to escape, don't you? The IG pulled me up because of you. No! Why are you beating him? - Hey! Who are you? Move away! Move. I am Koli. Oh! She's the one, sir. She's the reason behind Shankar's escape. Hey! Get away, I said. - No! Get away or else I won't spare you. Gorongo, take her away. Get away. Come on, leave. Listen to me or else I'll thrash you. Go ahead. Beat me up. Kill me. I won't leave him. - Hey! Sir! Sir.. Don't get angry. Come here. You need to understand one thing. Please cool down a bit. I'll convince them. Hey, Shankar. Listen to me. Look, what will she do if you go to jail? She'll come along. - The jail isn't your private property. It's not your father's property either. Trust me, do one thing. Drop her home. No! I won't go anywhere without him. The same thing again! Her mother will get her married to another guy, sir. Such a confusing situation. Sir, I was thinking.. There's a big problem over here. What if her mother creates a bigger problem? Sir, let's do one thing. Take both of them along. Put the handcuffs on him. - Yes. Come on, guys. I will be in a bigger trouble because of you. I'm coming, sir. Come on, let's go. We're getting late. The boy is quite decent, sir. I know him very well. He's just having a bad time. Hold on. Get inside. Get in. Come in, sir. That's it. Come on. Come on, move it. Koli. Let's go. "My dreams have transformed into waterfall." "I can hear your name in my ears." "The heavenly drops from above tantalizes the nature." "Tends to melt our hearts." "Dreams have transformed to waterfall." "I can hear your name in my ears." "The heavenly drops from above, tantalizes the nature." "Tends to melt our hearts." "When I am with you" "there's nothing to worry about." "When you're there" "there's nothing to worry about." "I've lost everything" "and conquered you." "There's nothing else that I need." "When I met you" "I got to know" "what love is." "May we live in peace." "All I want is just both of us." "When I am with you" "there's nothing to worry about." "When you're there" "there's nothing to worry about." "The soothing breeze" "sings along the way." "My heart gets delightful" "the time you met me." "The way you chased my blues" "makes me feel above the world." "I surrender myself to you." "You are the reason behind my happiness." "When I am with you" "there's nothing to worry about." "When you're there" "there's nothing to worry about." "When I am with you" "there's nothing to worry about." "When you're there" "there's nothing to worry about." What happened? What's wrong now? Why this mess at this hour? Damn it! What's wrong, brother? - We have a flat tire. Hey, Gorongo. Get off the car. Yes, sir. Move fast. - Get down quick. Yes, quick. What's the matter, sir? We're having a flat tire. Damn it! I say, we could've eaten something until then. There's no time. 'The number you've dialed is currently unavailable.' 'Please try again later.' 'The number you've dialed is currently unavailable.' Does your mobile.. catch love... I mean catch a signal here, sir? - You won't get signal here. Come on. Make a move. Come on. Move quickly. Come on, keep moving. Move! Over here. This journey has no end. The mountains, waterfall.. Land and further away. We've been walking since ages. Move! Walk faster. - Yes. What's wrong? Who are you waving your hand to? What nonsense! Let's go! Come on! Oh my goodness. Hey! Hey! Hey! What nonsense! Shut up! What's making you laugh? You have nothing more to do. At least, find a car. Shall I stop one? - Go on. Yes, come on. Let me see. Oh! - Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, sir. - Hey! What's wrong with you people? What makes you stand in the middle of the street? What's going on here? Extremely sorry! - I will bash you up. Sorry! - Why are they fooling around? I apologize on their behalf. I'll introduce myself. Have a look. I'm a police officer. I need to take this prisoner along with me. It's urgent. It would be nice if you could drop us to the bus stand. All right, come along. - Please. Thank you. Hey, Gorongo. - Yes, sir. Get them in the car. Waiter, water please. I am thirsty, too. Here, take this. I'm worried to death and you guys are getting all lovey-dovey. How long will it take.. An hour for a simple dish. Four portions of platter please. Get it quick. Sir. Sir, when will Shankar get released? In no time. In fact tomorrow itself. Am I right, sir? - Will you be quiet? Did I say anything wrong, sir? What did I do? - What did you do? Because of you, my.. Watch out. You will realize it now. I will put you in jail all your life. Hey, Koli. He's kidding. He'll let me go tomorrow. Just wait and watch. - Am I kidding? Am I? Is it? You'll pay for it. I'll go to work on you and when I am done no one will ever dare to escape. Look, what I'll do this time. Hey. When will I get to eat? How much time do you take? Can't you be quick? Koli, come on, eat. Hey, Koli! Hey! Hey! - Sit down! Sit down quietly! What's going on here? Lunch. Can't you see? Yes, I can see that. Won't he eat? Why should it matter to you? If he's handcuffed how he will be able to eat? Spare his hands. I won't. Mind your own business. - That's what I am doing. I am a Human Rights officer. This is my duty. My responsibility. That's why I am warning you to take off his handcuffs. I agree he's a convict. It doesn't look good while eating. This is a crime against humanity. Do you know I've been through hell to catch hold of him? Don't be philosophical. Leave. Listen! If you don't listen to me I'll call the local police and media. Do whatever you feel like. You may leave. Don't tell me I didn't warn you. Oh my God! We'll be in trouble if the media finds out. Hello! I'm standing here. - I told you before, didn't I? Yes, it's me. Yes, I am here. Can you come here please? Sir! - Hey, listen. Bring some media people along. Yes. Hey, media man. Hey! Hold on...a minute. Have a look here. I am taking it off. Look. It's unlocked. Listen, no need to come. That's okay. - What have you done? Sir, try to understand. I'll handcuff him once he leaves. - Yes. Or else we might be in trouble. Sir, I've unlocked it. Are you happy? Okay, I'll hang up now. Go. Sir, where will he go? Let it be. Come on, go. Such a mess. He won't even let me eat. Hey, Koli. Why did you come here? Hurry never helps. Whether it's essential or not. Never do that. I know, it's love but.. Hey! Shankar! Hey, Shankar! Shankar! Come! Hello? What's the matter, Gorongo? Shankar has escaped. What did you say? Oh my God! There! Hey! Hey Shankar! Oh! Shankar! Koli! What happened? Let me see. Koli, just hold on a second. Hey! There you are! Sir, let's go. - Why should I? Please let us go. - Why should I? Careful. Yes. Sit. Doctor! Doctor! Doctor, it's an emergency. Please doctor, come immediately. Who are you? How did you come in? Go and sit over there. I'll call you once I'm done. Open your mouth. More. Hey doctor! Can't you see she's going through pain? I won't spare you if you anything happens to her. Where is she? Over here. Come. What a headache! Where do such people come from? Show me. Let me see what's wrong. Koli has badly hurt her feet. The bleeding doesn't stop. She's in so much pain. Unfortunately, I am a dentist. What can I do in this? Go to the dispensary. This can't be treated here. I beg you, doctor. I don't understand all that. Do whatever is possible, doctor. I promise, I'll do anything I'm capable of. I'll do the cleaning, dusting and everything else. - Okay. Okay. I'll take care of it. Get the cotton and antiseptic. Let me check your feet. Doctor. The dressing has to be untied. No. - How will I do the bandage if you refuse? Don't worry, I am there. Here. Get the medicines and injection. Will you lend me some money? What? How will I arrange the medicines if I don't get money. You're so strange. Will I pay for your medicines? Who else will do? I know, you will. Because you are a good person. My sister always told me that God lives in every kind-hearted person. You are my God, doctor. - Hey! Hey stop! Okay! Too much. Take this and go. Be seated here. I'll be right back. Sir, over here. - Yes, sir. Any updates, Siddhartha? Did you get hold of the criminal? Yes, sir. Tomorrow I want to see you with the criminal. Keep that in mind. Okay, sir, okay. Gorongo. - Yes. They must be here. What rubbish!. It's a dental clinic. The girl has injured her legs not her teeth. Watch out the cart. - Where? Oh! That's the same cart. - Come on. Come on. Look sir, over here. Koli. Wow. You have a beautiful name. - Come in. What's wrong? - Here. I was right, wasn't I? Hey, where is Shankar? I.. I don't know. - Is that so? Hey! What's happening? - You don't know, is it? She's my patient. Who are you guys? Police. - Police? Hey, come on get up. Get up! - Hey, what are you doing? You can't treat a patient this way. This is not the way police.. - Hey, doctor! I can put you behind bars too. Did you get that? Where did you hide the boy who came along with her? Tell me! Gorongo. - Yes. Go and check inside. Oh no, there's no one inside. He went to buy medicines. Why are you standing here? He's gone to buy medicines. - Go in and check. He must be hidden somewhere. Hey, get up! Hey! What are you doing? - Get up. Gorongo? No, sir. There's nothing here except teeth all around. Come on, move it! - Doctor! What's happening? Come with me. - Hey listen, you can't.. Hey, what happened? Tell me. - This is not the way to treat. You're a dentist, aren't you? - Yes. So why were you treating her feet? You seem to be a multi-specialist. You shall operate upon my kidney now. Oh no! - Show your hand. Sorry. Sorry, I am mistaken. Now you get it. You have so much knowledge without any pride. Mind your own business. I'll come if I have dental problems. Come on! Be quick. Move fast! - Please spare me. Please spare me. Stop the drama and come with me. Please let me go. I beg.. I beg you, sir. Shankar will try to find me. Leave me. - That's what I want. That's what I want. Call Shankar. Shankar! Shankar! Shankar! Call him. If he truly loves you he will come to your rescue. He will be right here. Hey! What's wrong? Why aren't you calling him? Why aren't you calling him? Call him. Hey, Shankar! Shankar! - Leave me. Please let me go. You won't listen, will you? - No. If I don't find Shankar here, I'll shoot each one of you. No! - He won't be able to save you. Call him. - No! Call him. Call out to him. Hey! Hey! Where is Shankar? Leave her! Leave her alone! Leave! - Shut up! Sir! Sir, what are you doing? This is a public place. All eyes are on us? You should stop now. - Quiet! Handcuff him. - Sir, please cool down. Leave it. I'll handle everything. All right. I'll take care of it. Shankar! Look, dear. Cool down. Can't you see how aggressive my senior is? What's the use? He'll shoot you right away. No! - That's why I am telling you. You both want to get married, right? I am with you. I'll get you married. Promise? - Yes! Trust me. Don't worry. I am there for you. Sir, have a look. Shankar has promised he wouldn't escape again. Handcuff him right now. Wait a second. There's no need for it. You won't escape, will you? He won't escape again. Look how obedient he is! Will you handcuff him or not? I said, he won't escape. How will he escape, tell me? If Shankar has to escape Koli will have to do the same which isn't possible for her. If Shankar tries to escape without Koli she'll be sent to her mother. - No! Absolutely no! I don't wish anything ill of you. I want both of you to be happily married. Come. Let's go. Come on. Move. Don't waste time. Are you serious? - Absolutely. Come on. Let's go. What nonsense! Sir, please don't blow your top. He is a kid. He will believe anybody. I have no words. It would have been difficult for us to convince them. We'll put Shankar behind bars and send the girl back home. Look. See it yourself. Come on, make a move. - Everyone get in. Get in fast. Quick. Quick. Get in. Get in, be quick. Hold a second. Where do you need to go? Have a seat, sir. Finally. Where shall I sit? The seat is vacant beside this fatso. Hey! - I'll settle down here. Who did you call fatso? You're a fatso. So is your dad and your family. Idiot! You're a fatso, too. - Hey! Do you know who are you talking to? Who are you? Are you a prime minister? Or a president. - I'll beat you up. Hey! Gorongo, what's wrong here? He's talking rubbish, sir. - Cut it out. Hey! Settle down quietly. - You're a common man. So am I. Two common men are brothers. And yet you snap at me. - Sit here quietly. I'll settle down here. Quietly. "King-hearted." "Will you promise to be by my side" "in my tiny castle? - No way!" "Will you promise to be by my side" "in my tiny castle? - No way!" "In my tiny castle.." "Don't you ever leave me." "Will you promise to be by my side" "in my tiny castle?" "We'll roam in Kolkata and have 'Jhalmuri'." "We'll have fun together. - Is it?" "We'll roam in Kolkata and have 'Jhalmuri'." "We'll have fun together." "I'll buy you cosmetics and saris." "I'll gift you with beautiful bangles. - Oh!" "I'll gift you with beautiful bangles." "I'll gift you beautiful bangles!" "Will you promise to be by my side" "in my tiny castle?" "Will you promise to be by my side" "in my tiny castle? - No way" "We'll fly like the honey bee" "we'll sing like the canary sitting on a branch. - Is it?" "We'll fly like the honey bee" "we'll sing like the canary sitting on a branch." "As you hop and fly like a bird" "I'll carry you and take off somewhere." "I'll carry you and take off somewhere." "In my tiny castle.." "Will you promise to be by my side" "In my tiny castle." "Will you promise to be by my side" "In my tiny castle." "You're an uptown girl and I am villager." "I call you by playing my flute. - I see!" "You're an uptown girl and I am villager." "I call you by playing my flute." "Your smile is what I see" "in my dreams in the day and in the night." "Don't you ever leave me." "In my tiny castle.." "Will you promise to be by my side?" "In my tiny castle.." "In my tiny castle.." "Don't you ever leave me." "Will you promise to be by my side?" "In my tiny castle.." "Will you promise to be by my side?" "In my tiny castle.." "Will you promise to be by my side?" "In my tiny castle.." Coming. Gorongo! Over here! Give me your hand, sir. Oh God! Patiently. Climb down. Be careful. Gorongo! Oh my God! Hey Shankar! Shankar, save the officer. Let's run away. I'll manage somehow. First, go and save him. What are you saying? Let's get away. Go and save him. We can't escape leaving him like that. Let me get you out first then I'll handle him. Move. Be careful. Koli, be careful. Shankar, please come quickly. My hands are slipping off. Come, let's go. Hurry! Be careful, sir. Thank God. Koli. Hello? Hello, sir? This is Dutt here. - Yes, Dutt. Tell me. Sir, will you be coming today? We got a bunch of calls from the main office. Everyone is questioning. Listen, no one leaves home tonight. No one should leave. No need, sir. We'll be waiting until the next day. Hey, Koli. Koli, why do you worry? I did whatever you said. - I'll be there. Maybe I'll take time here. I failed to understand you. You saved my senior officer. Sir, I didn't do anything. I only did what my heart asked me to do. Look here. She's my heart. Sir, are you all right? Thank you. Sir. She's my life. She has been troubled a lot, sir. That's the reason I escaped. Forgive me, sir. How can I leave.. We are together since childhood. I understand. It's all right. I'll remember your words. Look, I want to see both of you happy. That's it. Go. Sir.. Koli. The officer told me that we can live peacefully. Come, Gorongo. Let's go. Will you be able to walk? - Yes. "You can be a bird" "if you want to." "Crossing many miles" "in search of food." "You can fly if you want to" "in the clear blue skies" "between these clouds" "we get lost somewhere." Hello. Who is it? Oh! Dear wife, it's you! Yes, I'll leave. Sir, I need to leave. Yes, I got that. All right, you may go. See you in the morning at 6. - Yes, sir. Sure. See you. - Greetings, sir. Yes, tell me. - Greetings. What nonsense! - Come on. Move. Sir, you're taking him along, aren't you? Don't worry. Just for tonight. I'll get his release order by tomorrow. All right? Till then wait here. I'll escort him inside. Come. Come. Why do you worry? What are you afraid of? You're going to the officer's house. Don't worry. Do sleep well. I'll see you. Shall I leave? Come. Open. Come. Make an entry in the register. Hey! Hey, why did you escape? - Hey! How dare you do that! - Dutt, what's wrong with you? What are you doing? - He troubled you a lot, sir. Everyone had to suffer because of him. Look at ourselves. - I can understand. Stop! Cool down. Listen.. Hey! Leave me! - What are you doing? Leave! - Get away, I said. Spare him! Are you out of your mind? The IG has asked me to present him tomorrow in the court. No one dare touch him until then. I understand your anger. Calm down. Go. Do your work. Dutt. - Yes, sir. Take him to his cell. Hey! Move. Go. Come. What's wrong? Didn't you go? I had asked you to go along with them, didn't I? Where were you the whole night? I told you, didn't I? Koli, come inside. What is she doing with you? You spent your whole night with her? You didn't even bother about me. How dare you bring her here! Answer me! - What rubbish! Do you know who she is? - I suspected you earlier. I've seen it myself now. That's the reason you never showed interest.. Meera! - Sir. I think I shall leave. It's unsafe for you to leave at this hour. You will stay right here. She'll stay with us? Then I'll leave home right now. You don't want me to live with you anymore. It's better if I die. I am leaving home. I'll commit suicide. Meera! Listen to me, Meera! - I'll commit suicide. Sir, don't let her.. Let it be. You go inside. Go. Hey, Shamoli. Make my bed. I am very sleepy. What's up, Dutt? Is everything fine? Yes, everything's all right. I can't understand why our officer is protecting that rascal. I thought I would bash him up nicely. Didn't we have sleepless nights because of him? Gorongo, can you tell me what's the matter? I'll let you know everything later. You'll be amazed after hearing it. Yes? No, brother. Can't tell you right now. My wife has made the bed for me. Listen! The bed is ready. Oh, yes I am coming. - I'll talk to you tomorrow. Okay, I'll hang up. Good night. "The only one who calls me respectably" "It's no other, but my wife." Yes Meera, tell me. What are you saying? How can Siddhartha dare to do so! All right! All right, I got that. Do one thing. Go home. Go home. Listen to me. Don't get angry, Meera. Meera, calm down. Don't be stupid. Go back home. What's the matter? M.. Meera! Meera. No. No, Meera. I said I'll handle it. I'll handle it. I'll see to it. Cool down, Meera. Meera. Listen to me, Meera! Don't be stupid, Meera. Meera. Meera, back off. What happened? What's the matter? Everything is over. "Here I come with my delightful heart between these clouds." Why are you staring at me? Shankar's.. release orders have been verified. Can you sign here to complete the process? Shall I tell you one thing? - Yes. Don't get offended. It's obvious that your wife suspects you. She had to leave suddenly in the middle of the night. No woman can tolerate another woman in her man's life. She won't take it positively. That's it, sir. Sir. Sir, please hurry up. Koli is waiting for me. Did you see that, sir? How desperate he is to meet Koli! This is a clear case of love. Isn't it? Let's go. I'll be back. - Yes. We'll wrap up soon, if we reach the court early. Yes, sir. Let's go. Come on, let's go. What nonsense is this? What's the matter? Hey brother, over here. What happened here? - There's a woman's dead body. I guess she committed suicide. 'You never did bother about me.' 'It's better if I die.' 'I am leaving home. I'll commit suicide.' 'I'll commit suicide.' Gorongo! - Yes, sir. You wait here. I'll be back. - Leave it. What's the use? This happens here every day. We should reach court. An accident doesn't bother you? All right, sir. Wait here. I'll see. Let's go. Get side! Move! Sir! Sir! Sir. Hello! - Hello. Siddhartha, sir? This is your neighbor Bose. The time you left in the morning.. "In my life" "I've wished for you." Koli, wake up. See this. "With the presence of God.." Koli, please get up. Koli. - "Both of us.." "May live immortal." "Got lost in your world." "Is what I feel." "Let's fly away." "You can be a bird" "if you want to." "Crossing many miles" "in search of food." "You can fly" "in the clear blue skies." "Between these clouds." "We get lost somewhere." Hey! Hey Shankar. Hey, Shankar! Shankar, where are you going? Shankar, don't go! Shankar, watch out for the train! Shankar! Shankar, get away! - Shankar, don't go. Shankar! Watch out! Get away! Shankar, back off! Shankar! "On the trail of life and death." "Peace and harmony." "Everything that I got" "is your heart." "I can defeat death." "No matter what happens." "If you wish to be with me" "I am all yours." "In my life" "I've conquered you." "With the presence of God." "Just both of us." "May live immortal." "Got lost in your world is what I feel." "Let's fly away." "You can be a bird" "if you want to." "Crossing many miles" "in search of food." "You can fly" "in the clear blue skies." "Between these clouds." "We get lost somewhere." "Why to worry." "Keep the trust alive." "That's what my heart spells." "Rest your head and listen." "In your arms" "I am living a happy life." "Sacrificing my everything to you." "In my life" "I've wished for you." "With the presence of God." "Just both of us." "May live immortal." "Got lost in your world is what I feel." "Let's fly away."
