Come to your senses! I'm a grown-up man. I've made up my mind. Father! You have no father any more! Look, James, can we manage to find Charles? I think it wouldn't be difficult, sir. He usually spends his time at the guest house. I came to say goodbye. Friends! Friends, I propose a toast to my brother who is leaving for America. Where he's going... to marry an American girl. - A very pretty American girl. - Stop clowning. But when our most kind father... got news of that American commoner, he went wild and had my brother cut off from the family forever. Now, now, Ceddie. Come on, forgive your brother. - You're drunk, Charles. - Yes, I'm drunk! But what difference does that make? Hey, old chap! Take a photographic picture of me and my brother. Whenever I feel blue, Ceddie, I'll look at it and remember what a brother I had, what an idiot! Minna, do you know what I'd like more than anything else in the world? To be photographed with you! Attention! Seven years later... I'm glad we found that old photo to give to the artist. On it he looks much better than he did in recent years. Poor Sir Charles and his weakness for alcohol... To die at such a young age! Dougal, come back! James, pay the artist. Everyone may go. Excuse me, your lordship. Lady Lorridaile! I'm sorry, brother, to have come without notice. What do you want? What a fine portrait! He should have been painted on the horse, from which this drunkard fell and broke his neck. To lose both sons and still exude so much venom! Do you have anything human in you? Even when Ceddie died, you didn't say a single good word about him. Go on, remind me again how he saved his crew in the ice, how he had never left the bridge. The poor boy is resting on the bottom of the sea. The poor boy married an American! Tell me, what did you come for? Since your elder son, Charles, had no wife and no children, your only heir now is your grandson, Ceddie's son. An American can't be my heir! Hey, wait for me! Too bad, sorry. Excuse me, sir. Dick, the priest will let us sit by the church on Sunday, only if I sell all the kittens his spotted cat had. - Will you buy a kitten, sir? - No, thanks, young man. Listen, Dick, would you like to earn ten cents? Who wouldn't, sir? Do you know Cedric, the son of Nora, a music teacher? You can give me your ten cents, sir. Hello! And where's Hobbs? Good afternoon, Mister Hobbs. I'll be jiggered if it's not Cedric! Abraham, for me and my best friend, Cedric... - Two glasses of cranberry juice. - Yes. Well, tell me how you are getting on? Things are looking up, Mister Hobbs. I have a very advantageous proposition for you. Here. Two cents each. I don't think we need a kitten, Mister Hobbs. We've got very good mouse-traps. I wouldn't be so sure, Mr. Abraham. It's not only about mice. The black one, for example, brings luck in business. And this one, with gray stripes, brings health. The one with a white apron is a very rare kitten. It helps in the matters of heart. Matters of heart, you say? - Sounds tempting. - Here, Mister Hobbs, look. He's walking to you himself. He will become a fine, pure-breed tomcat. You may call him Marquis, like carpenter Ervin's. - Or Earl. - Did I hear you right? Did you say "earl"? Cedric, do you know what earls are? Now he will be haranguing the English. Earls are pompous English turkey-cocks wearing crowns. - His wife was English. - So what? She ran away from him. I know it, because my grandfather used to tell me about it. This is President Washington. Look. My grandfather fought against them in the Civil War. And when the President pinned a Purple Heart medal to his chest, my grandfather said, "I'm ashamed to have fought such an adversary." Because all the English are cowards! And all this because they let those earls and lords govern them, I'll be jiggered! See? I'm not! And you suggest that I give my cat one of these shameful nicknames, so that he grow as cowardly and pitiful as they are. No, Cedric, it's not for this that I'm paying my two cents. Oh, what a mug! - Hello, Mrs. Evans. - Hello, Cedric. I've sold all the priest's kittens. Here, take an apple an run home, or you'll get as wet as I am. - Goodbye. - Thanks, Mrs. Evans. - Mamma! - Cedric, you're all wet. Mamma, listen to what I'll tell you. Hello. Good evening, sir. Cedric, meet Mr. Havisham. He came all the way from England to see us. - From England? - That's right. I see you've sold all the priest's kittens, haven't you, sir? - Yes, for as much as two cents each. - Congratulations. If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you a question. What are your plans for the future? I hope I might be a President of the United States of America. Well, it's commendable. Cedric, I would like you to know it from the start. Mr. Havisham is a lawyer. He came to invite you to England. But why? I was told there're some lords and earls there. You're absolutely right. I would like you to know that one of the earls is your grandfather, and one of those lords is you, sir! Lord Fauntleroy! Me? But I don't want to be a lord! To be a lord is a great honour. Your father thought so. Besides, you're the heir to a big fortune. So your going to England is more than justified, my lord. Mamma, I'm not going anywhere without you. Of course, your mother will go with you. You both will live in your county, and you'll become so rich that be able to buy all the kittens in the world for 10 years from now. Your father was very fond of England, his home country. He dearly loved his family castle. He so wanted you to receive a good education. Now God has provided us that opportunity. You don't seem to be convinced how serious your grandpa's intentions are. And nevertheless, starting from this day, you have at your disposal a pretty big sum of money. Hello. - Ready. Check our work, sir. - The owner will check it. Mrs. Evans! I'll pray for you, my boy. - Goodbye, Mister! - Have a safe journey. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Good luck to you. Thank you. Yes, who could expect it? They will travel first class. Big deal! They're rolling in money over there, Mr. Hobbs. His grandpa wanted to send a whole ship for Cedric. No, he didn't, Dick. You'd better think about how you're going to manage our business alone. Oh, Cedric, Cedric, it's all right that you'll be living in England now, I'll be jiggered if it's not! - Come on, hold on. - Goodbye. And don't forget, you've got real friends here. Thank you. Farewell! This is for you, Mr. Hobbs. And this is for you, Dick. Thanks. - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Good luck! Farewell! Have a nice journey! Goodbye! The guest house for the little lord's mother is ready, Your Lordship. So send her there right away. I don't want to see that American in my castle. Yes, Your Lordship. - Cedric. - Yes, Mamma? I should have told you that long ago. You know, there're certain rules here. How should I explain it to you... You see, my lord... The point is that you'll have to live separately from your mamma. - What is he saying, Mamma? - Calm down, son. Mister, if you'd said right away that I'd live separately from mamma and never see her, then... Who said you'd never see your mamma? She will live quite near you. - Your grandpa's taken care of it. - Really? Please, Mrs. Nora. This is Mellory, our housekeeper. She will be solving all your domestic problems. - Good afternoon, ma'am. - Good afternoon. - This is Emma, your maid. - Nice to meet you. - Hello. - Oh God, what beautiful eyes! - Hello. - Hello, my lord. - Nice to meet you, Miss, Missis... - Just Mellory. The morning papers, Your Lordship. Dougal, come here! Thomas, never do what you're not ordered to do. Your mamma will be thinking about you. How do you do? How do you do? How do you do? Grandpa! I'm so glad to see you! My lord, his lordship the Earl is waiting for you in the library. This castle holds the portraits of all the Fauntleroys that have lived in the last 400 years. These two were bitter enemies, because their ancestors fought against each other in the Wars of the Roses, the first on the side of the Lancasters, the others on the side of the Yorks. This Fauntleroy was a famous seaman who participated in destroying the Invincible Armada. And this one had the same name as you, my lord. Cedric. He was executed. He was not prudent enough and took the side of Charles, and they chopped off his head, like Charles's. Oh, this is... This is... Yes, this is your father, my lord. Sir John Arthur Molyneux Errol Cedric Fauntleroy! Dougal, come back! Hello, Dougal. - Why do you limp, Grandpa? - It's my gout. You're too young to know what it is. But some day you'll know. No, Grandpa, I'll be jiggered if I don't know what gout is. My good friend, Mrs. Evans, the apple woman, suffers from it. She's an old black woman. She keeps moaning: "My old bones, my poor old bones". You should put your feet in hot water and mustard. It helps Mrs. Evans a lot. Take forks and knives from outside, one at a time, as dishes arrive. Thank you. Did someone ask you, James? I'm sorry, Your Lordship. Grandpa, why don't you wear your crown? Mr. Hobbs told me that all earls wear crowns. - What crown? - Do you have many? The crown is a symbol of royal power. Did your Mr. Hobbs tell you who is the king? Of course. The king is the English President. Presidents are in America. Any commoner can be a President. The King is quite another matter. A ragamuffin can never become a king. And what about Jeremiah Pool from the soap factory? He was so poor, and now he donated money for building a school. And his portrait hangs at its entrance. They even write about him in the newspapers. So what is he now? A king. What? The sausage king. Fifteen. Thirty-five. Forty-two. Seventeen. - Thank you, my lord. - Thank you. Your suit will be ready tomorrow. So, Havisham, you're trying to persuade me that the boy's mother refused to take the allowance? That's right. She told me so while we were in America. Is that so? And on what money is she going to live? She gets a small pension for her husband. I still don't believe a single word that American plebeian says. It must be some design. She's just hiking up the price. You will see! No, I can't quite agree with you, sir. That dame's influence on Lord Fauntleroy is very pernicious. I think it was she who put him up to pretend to be a loving grandson. Actually, they're only interested in my fortune. - Excuse me, Your Lordship. - What is it this time? The little lord wishes to say good night to you. - Good night, Grandpa. - Good night. - Good night, Mr. Havisham. - Good night, sir. Something else? Grandpa, may I go to my mamma first thing in the morning? You have many things to do tomorrow. I already said, you'll go on Sunday. Or on Monday. The little lord has got such incredible eyes! My heart stood still when I saw them. And his father, God rest his soul, everyone adored him... I think the Earl even regretted that Ceddie wasn't his eldest and wouldn't get the title. Well, good night, ma'am. Good night. Mellory... When you see Cedric, tell him... Just kiss him. - Good night, my lord. - Good night, Thomas. Please, leave the candle. Now they wear pants and hats. Just like everybody, whites and blacks. They put on feathers only on their Indian holidays. Go on, chew it. What? Just chew it? That's all? Yes, just chew. That's why it's called chewing gum. And then we'll have to spit it out? Such a tasty and sweet thing? Yes, but you have to chew it for a long time, until... Oh! I think I swallowed it. What will happen to me now? Nothing, I guess... Once I swallowed it, too. Did you? James, what is the little lord doing in the servants' hall? He wished to have a cup of tea with us. And he treated us to a new American delicacy. I mean, a product. What's the matter with you, James? I'm afraid I was so careless that I swallowed it. Grandpa, I brought some for you, too. Would you like to taste it? I would like that you immediately leave the servants' hall. This park and the land around it have belonged to the Fauntleroy family for hundreds of years now. All this will be yours when you become an earl. After my death, of course. In that case, I don't want to be an earl, because I don't want you to die. Perhaps we'll live to see a kind earl in this castle. Yes, it's possible. However, my father... You all know that he was a footman, too. He told me that the Earl was also a wonderful child. I like it here very much, Grandpa. This park is as beautiful as Central Park in New York. My mamma took me there. You're looking at one of the largest and most beautiful parks in England. I'm taking your horse, Higgins, in payment of your debts. Though you won't need it anyway. You're behindhand in paying the rent on the land. Who is that poor man, Grandpa? An earl doesn't have to know everybody who works on his land. There are managers for that, such as Newick. Good afternoon, Your Lordship. And this is, I presume, the little lord... You guessed right, Newick. It will be he who's going to fire you when you get old and slow-witted. Now you. - Are you ready? - Yes. Calm down, Cedric. Calm down. You're nervous. And it's inadmissible when shooting. Father MacDowey to see you. Good afternoon, Your Lordship. Good afternoon, Father. Is it again about the repair of your church? Walls can wait. People are more important. His name is Higgins, my lord. The manager took his horse, and now he wants to evict Higgins. That's why he's the manager. But the manager wouldn't take into account that his wife died and he's left with five children, and he's seriously ill himself. Though he's always been a good worker. If he's a good worker, he doesn't need your protection, from which I would like you to abstain in the future, Father. Grandpa, I pity that poor farmer anyway. What would you do if you were in my place? I would order that manager not to take his horse and land. A rainy day may happen to anyone. A rainy day, you say? Well, if you hit it, you will have it your way. Four mistakes. I will have to take teachers for you beginning next month. An earl should be an educated man. Read it. Dear Mr. Newick, Will you please give the house and the horse back to Mr. Higgins? You would thus much oblige me. Yours respectfully, Fauntleroy. Well, what can I say? From the legal point of view, this paper is irreproachable. He will make me a philanthropist. Seal it. You think it's just a toy, my lord? No, it isn't. Why would a toy be here? It's a heirloom. - The Fauntleroy family heirloom. - Wow! What is a heirloom? A heirloom is a thing... Well, it's the best of all things. You'd better ask your grandfather. This one, it's several hundred years old. It is Mary Stewart's box. It has quite a history. Thomas, let me see it. No, we're not allowed to. Please, Thomas. Well, how can I refuse you? Grandpa! Grandpa, it's I who did it! Thomas warned me and I wouldn't listen to him. He just helped me to pick the fragments. When I was your age, Cedric, I was punished forjust trying to touch that thing. - Cedric? - Mamma. - What happened, dear? - No, Mamma, nothing happened. It's just that I'm missing you so much. It's a whole week until Sunday. It's only four days. I'll stay with you an hour and go back. They'll be so alarmed at the castle when they find out you're gone. - They won't find out. - How can they not? Promise that you'll never leave the castle without asking your grandpa. - All right? - Yes. Mamma, this is the horse that frightened me last night. It was over there. - A good horse. - Yes, it's a good horse. Let's go. Grandpa is very kind. But they have very stupid rules here. Why can't we live all together? Rules are made for people to follow them. Are they? How could you walk all alone through that lowland last night? That's all. From here you will to by yourself. Mamma. Don't forget. You promised not to go anywhere without asking your grandpa. - All right, Mamma. - You have to keep your word. Now it's one day less until Sunday. Goodbye, Mamma. What? What is it, Dougal? Good morning, Lord Fauntleroy. Good morning, Grandpa. - What's the news, James? - No news that may be of interest to Your Lordship. Except that the messenger came with the mail. I looked at him, and his ears were all covered with wool. Maybe he walked through the lowland at night? Of course, he did. Several times. Then it explains it. Everybody knows that you can't walk through the lowland at night. That's what I thought, Your Lordship, that it was all about the lowland. Henry and Willard go there at night to meet girls, and their ears have been hairy since. Is it so? I didn't notice. It's because they shave them. What are you looking at, young man? Nothing, Grandpa. Better go out on the balcony and look. It may be more interesting. Grandpa, look at that horse! It's yours. Go and change for riding. My lord, his name is Hannibal IV. What's the matter, Williams? Where's the riding suit that I've given to the little lord? Why is he dressed like an American shepherd? You want him to be the laughingstock of the whole county? It's not a laughingstock. It's the costume of the Paleface Shooter, the terror of the Wild West! Mr. Hobbs himself gave it to me for the 4th of July! Mr. Hobbs himself. A great connoisseur of the riding costumes. Grandpa, can't I ride by myself in the park? The Fauntleroy blood speaks in him. Look, Havisham, how straight he sits on the horse. My grandfather is very kind. Everyone loves him: Servants and farmers, and the dog Dougal, and my horse Hannibal IV. And my grandfather has as much land in the county as ten towns. As for the rooms in my grandpa's castle... Can you imagine it, Dick? Over one hundred! What? What do they need that many for? Goodbye now. Yours affectionately, Cedric. Once more, Nancy. Hold your hand. Cedric! Williams, can you teach me to steeplechase? Of course, my lord. If the Earl will allow it. Of course, he will. I'll ask him. The grandpa will be only happy. - Do they live far from here? - No. A little over a mile. But it must be difficult for him to walk. That's life, my lord. Good evening, Your Lordship. Good evening, Mr. Havisham. I beg your pardon for such a late visit, but... Look here. "Dear Mr. Newick, I'm very grateful to you for helping poor Higgins. I have one more request. Please give my horse, Hannibal IV, to the lame boy from the village. Yours respectfully, Fauntleroy. What shall I do, Your Lordship? Don't you see, Newick, the Fauntleroy signature on this paper? Do you have any other questions? Then do it! Yes, sir. Excuse me, Your Lordship. What else? Shall I buy a new horse for the little lord? No new horses. He must take responsibility for his actions. Little Lord Fauntleroy is giving orders. He's developing a taste for it! Believe me! He is! And much sooner than we had expected. Well, goodbye, Hannibal IV! Don't miss me. And obey your new master. He needs you more than I do. What's that filth? It's not filth. Dougal, meet your new friend. It's time to introduce the boy to society. Everything has to be rewritten. And no wives and daughters. Yes, Your Lordship. And I thought I didn't change, James. Strange how it could happen. We'll move the buttons, Your Lordship. It's a matter of a few minutes. It will look even better than before. You may keep it. Move the buttons as you like. And order a new one for me. Those fanfarons have a very sharp eye for such details. Gentlemen, I would like to introduce to you my grandson and my only heir, the young Lord Fauntleroy. How do you do, dear fanfarons? We heard, Lord, that you came to England quite recently. What are your impressions, sir? I like it very much. But I'm especially happy that I've met my grandfather. What are your plans for the future? My grandpa says that when I grow up, I'll be in the House of Lords, too. So you'll become a real... what was your expression? A real fanfaron. What law would you have enacted first? - Or you don't know it yet? - I know it very well. I'll abolish the rule, by which my kindest in the world grandpa and I have to live separately from my mamma! Excuse me, Your Lordship, lawyer Havisham asks you to receive him. - Now? - Sorry, he says it's very urgent. - What happened? - I have bad news. - You had two sons. - Is that what you wanted to tell me? We thought that only your younger son had a child, sir. Isn't that so? Today I was approached, as your agent, by a lady named Minna. I must say, a pretty vulgar and aggressive creature. She showed me some documents to the effect that she was married to your elder son. Remember the woman on the photo, from which his portrait was made? That was she. I wouldn't be surprised if that drunkard, Charles, had a dock wench as his secret wife. That's not the point. They had a child. It was also a boy. His name is Maximilian. And by the laws of the United Kingdom, he's your only heir. You've gone mad, Havisham. That Minna wishes to see you tomorrow. Tell the boy that he can go to see his mother tomorrow. That will make him very happy. Gentlemen, I propose a toast to the heir. To little Lord Fauntleroy! Good luck to you, sir. We're pleased to have met you. You're in for a great future. Now that everything has been resolved so luckily, I'm sure we'll live like one big happy family. Your grandson and your only heir, Maximilian, will be a worthy successor to the glorious Fauntleroy family. You will be very happy in your old age. Yes, Grandfather, with us you'll be as safe as behind a stone wall. Look, boy, go to the next room and close the door behind you as tightly as possible. Hey, dear, give me a glass of water. Of course, I'll settle a good income on you. As for living, as you put it, like one big happy family, ...don't even think of it. - But... As long as I live, you won't be let into the castle. But I thought that... The Fauntleroy men... if the die of natural causes, of course, usually live a long life. A very long life. Yes, Max, practically it's all yours already. But only on one condition: If you keep your mouth shut. - Why? I thought the old man would be glad. - Don't think. It's me who's thinking for you. It's quite a job you've given me, Mr. Hobbs. One cent for ten flies is too cheap. Why don't we revise our contract? If you catch a hundred of those pests, you'll get a pretty good sum. Dick, you don't mean you want Mr. Abraham chasing those flies? That's why I hired you. It will make a very good income, my boy. That's it! It was the tenth, Mr. Hobbs. Where's my cent? Your cent? Oh, the cent. Let me count your flies first. - One, two, three... - Here's one more. Four... What is this? An English paper? Abraham, how could an English paper get into our store? Oh, these coffee grinders were wrapped in it, Mr. Hobbs. What is it? - What is it? I'll be jiggered! - What happened to you, Mr. Hobbs? To me? No, it's not to me. But I guess I'll have to go to New York for Primus stoves. They say, this year there will be a great demand for Primus stoves. Where are your manners? - My lord. - Yes, James? Never mind, it's nothing. I got so used to little Cedric, and now this! Yes. And that insolent mother of the new heir, Maximilian! Nora, Cedric's mother, is quite different. She's a very nice lady, you can believe me. Well, it seems Cedric is not fated to become Lord Fauntleroy. And we can do nothing about it. I... I just happened to be here. I haven't heard anything. That's how life is, my friend. You think you're on top, but one step is enough, and you're falling to the bottom, only at the eleventh hour to grasp at a straw offered to you by someone you don't know. - Grandpa, can I ask you a question? - What question? Since I'm no longer Lord Fauntleroy, don't you want me any more? Stop talking nonsense. You're my... my favourite grandson and you will always be. Then I don't care if I'm going to be an earl or not. Only don't try to make me shed a tear. You'll never succeed. One month later... Mamma, he's so smart. I want to set him on partridges. - Will Grandpa take me hunting? - Of course, he will. You have a visitor, ma'am. I see everything's turning out very well. I wanted your son to hear what we're going to talk about. Here's a detailed account of your adventures, and every second newspaper calls you what you really are - cheats, frauds and impostors! I don't understand what you're talking about. Happily, the Earl now knows who is who. And he's doing everything to restore the justice. - What are you talking about? - Don't you know? At this very moment the Earl is showing Maximilian around the castle and the grounds. The boy has been deprived of his care and attention for so long. By the way, my dear, he also gave the room where your son lived to the real Lord Fauntleroy, Maximilian! Is everything clear to you now? James, have my coat cleaned of the road dust. Yes, sir. Strike while the iron is hot, my boy. I'm sure that tonight everything will be finally settled in this castle. Yes, in my castle. Good afternoon, Your Lordship. Oh, you came just at the right moment. We were going to send for you. I hope we can dot all the i's today? And you no longer doubt the authenticity of my documents? We have a guest who will answer all of your questions. Hello, Minna. You haven't changed a bit. - Who is he? - Your mother's husband. Or I would say, her ex-husband, if not for the fact that the marriage had not been dissolved when you, Missis Minna, ran away from Mr. Hobbs. Am I right, Mr. Hobbs? Absolutely right, Mr. Havisham. Exactly seven years ago, I'll be jiggered if not. In this case, a question is in order: How did you come into possession of this nine-year-old boy, if seven years ago there was not so much as a mention of him? I see you find it difficult to answer. Well, then we'll put questions to Mr. Maximilian. With the help of our friends in Scotland Yard, whom, I presume, he knows notjust by hearsay. You promised me that we would eat on silver, drive in a carriage, be dressed by London's best tailors, and what am I seeing? That was not the deal! A very sound judgement, sir. If you don't wish to spend your immediate future in the company of London police, instead of London tailors, you'll have to answer our questions. "Everything will be yours! You'll live in the lap of luxury!" Go ahead, ask your questions. - Who are your real parents? - I don't know. I'm an orphan. And she was getting her forged documents from one-legged Hugh when I dropped by to skin him for an old debt. Well, she began to pester me: Let's clinch a deal. Nothing doing: You just have to pretend you're a young lord. As if I haven't seen enough of young lords. They're a dime a dozen on the Strand at night. Oh, I beg your pardon, Your Lordship, I meant, a great many. An exhaustive account, sir. - Can I go now? - Have a nice day, sir. Everything's been done to perfection. Did you calm down enough to be able to sign a few documents? Will you let me go after that? I think so. Unfortunately, the Earl is in good spirits today. James, have my carriage brought to the door. I'm ready to visit Cedric's mother. We have just to remember how the terrified adversary kissed the feet of our soldiers. I know it from my late grandfather. And he was a great warrior! Well, Mellory, are you happy at last? We're going to your favourite lady. You can join us. Excuse me, where were we? So, when President Washington pinned a Purple Heart medal onto my grandfather's chest, he said: "I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed to have fought such an adversary." What adversary are you talking about? I didn't quite get it. Lady Lorridaile, Your Lordship. We had a very hard time. And there you are, like a guardian angel. - Come on, Mrs. Mellory. - Miss, Mr. Hobbs. I know I have sworn that I'd never put foot in this house, but the whole England is talking about you... And I should meet at last my two, as of now, grand-nephews. - Two? - Yes. - Cedric and Maximilian. - Maximilian... I presume that Maximilian is already on his way to London's thieves-den. You can go with me. I'll explain everything on our way. Where are we going? Cedric is at his mamma's now. I've decided that it's time for me to meet Lady Fauntleroy. - You haven't met her yet? - Well, itjust turned out that way. I will do it now, and, perhaps, apologize. And when Cedric comes out to meet us, I'll pull out his watch and say: "Well? Did I get here in time?" They're gone. They took all their things and went away. They left a letter for you. Dear Grandpa, Mamma and I don't want to bother you any more. We're leaving. I'll always remember you with gratitude. Your grandson, Cedric. You see how it all ended? The swindlers are exposed, Fate has brought us together, and there's such a misfortune... Don't worry, Mr. Hobbs, we have the best police in the world. Perhaps they've already found the little lord and Mrs. Nora. All the efforts to find them have had no result so far. However, the little lord and his mother are still in Britain. All passenger boats for America are being thoroughly searched. So many days have passed! In that time you could have a country-wide census. Believe me, sir, we're doing everything possible. I very much hope so. I'm ready to go and search for them myself. I can imagine what a difficult time you're going through. My heart is breaking with compassion. You've changed so much! Fate would have to reward you for that, but you see what happened? Hold on, brother! I think our police... I respect our police, but my hopes are elsewhere. Buy newspapers! Latest news! The heir of Earl Fauntleroy has disappeared! The reward is guaranteed! Give alms to a blind man. After I left your place, I was picked up by a horse-cab, in which were Cedric and his mother. They were heading for the port, to go to America. They hoped they had enough money to buy the 3rd-class tickets. I volunteered to help them, absolutely altruistically, of course. Speaking of the money. When will you pay me the reward you promised? Go on. I have many friends in the port. When we arrived, we learned that the next passenger boat was in 3 days. And suddenly we met... Is it really you? That captain turned out to be their old acquaintance. His cargo boat, carrying sowing machines to America, was leaving in an hour. Mind you, Your Lordship, they were awfully lucky. They've saved lots of money. Do you know how much a ticket to America costs? No other way, Miss. No money! We don't make money on passengers. Your husband was my friend. He was a very worthy man! What do you know! The same face. Just a spitting image! That's about all. Give me the money. As you have promised. Am I getting my five thousand? Don't get so excited, sir. It's bad for your health. Cedric! You've learned to play that thing so well, Dick. - I missed you, Cedric. - I missed you too, Dick. And what about your castle, servants and a hundred rooms? I don't have them any more, Dick. - So you won't leave America again? - Never. What are you doing here? Where's Dick? I'm guarding the spot. While that loafer, Dick, is buying patented brushes. You see, the spot is very important. You can'tjust leave the spot. Fine shoes, sir! I know about shoes. Let me just give them a touch... I think you've become a good bootblack. Well, that trade may come handy on a rainy day, little Lord Fauntleroy.
