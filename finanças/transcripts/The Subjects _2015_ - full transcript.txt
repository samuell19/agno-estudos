As more and more countries need our help, we are growing everyday. It doesn't matter where you live or when you need us, we will be there. And with your help, we can change tomorrow. - I did it. - I did it too. - We all did it. - [VOICEOVER] Have you ever wanted to be part of the future, to help human kind take the next step? Well then, clinical trials are for you. And now, it's your time to do it too. - [VOICEOVER] Get involved today. - I fucking hate that ad. - I bet it has something to do with these boxes. - Presents! What do you think it is? - It's a drug trial. Guess. - I hate guessing games. I'm seriously terrible at them. - They contain the drugs for the trial. - Oh right. Obviously. - We just take them? And shouldn't they give us more information? - Yes, come on. The rep said it was quick, easy money. - Don't worry. I've done heaps of these. They're easy as fuck. - I opened my box guys. - You just became my favorite person in this room. - Hello everyone. Welcome to test 1477-REMJG. I'm Dr. Everitt Skye. And thank you for coming down on such short notice. I won't take much of your time. Just some rules and regulations to get through. How did this go? Good? No? I'm just doing one of these things. Sorry guys. So I hope you all found today's location just fine and we are very sorry for keeping you waiting. Please stop waving at me, sir. I can see you. So usually you'd be in one of our regular lab testing facilities but they were. The best we could find at short notice was this sound studio which is actually looking pretty good. So please don't touch anything or move stuff around. You might get hurt. I actually think some famous bands played in there. I wouldn't know because I'm not really a music guy, but you can check the website when you get home. It's very interesting. Anywho, please don't take the pill at the same time. And the standard eight-hour test will begin. The second that time hits zero the doors will unlock and you're free to go home. - Wait. What do you mean unlock? - Oh, the doors must stay locked. Leaving the room invalidates the data. You won't get paid. So pretty please, don't go anywhere. So thanks for being part of the future of science. You're all heroes in there. Fight for a better tomorrow. Have fun, all the best and good luck. - Wait. What if I get claustrophobic? Hello? Hello. - Hey, there are cameras everywhere. Don't steal. - That's kleptomania. I get claustrophobic. It's fear of small spaces. - You probably should've done a clinical trial then. Don't worry. Those places are massive. Actually, it's not as big, is it? It's actually quite small, isn't it? It's like the walls are like coming in you, aren't they? Wait, you get a little bit sweat in your brow. - Leave her alone, would you? - Just a little bit of fun, sweetheart. - Eight hours in here together should be pretty easy. So you've done this before? - Yes, shitloads. - You got any advice? - Yeah, don't be a dickhead. - Okay everyone, let's take the pill. - I wonder what it does to us. Imagine if it's molly or something and we all get totally high. That'll be awesome. - I wish. But it's not gonna do nothing. You see, we're control. - I don't think you're right. - And who are you? I think we're about to embark on something really special. - Energy in the room. He's one of them. - Okay guys, let's just stop talking and take the pill. - And the timer won't start until we do. - What is control? - Clinical trials have the two. And a placebo go to the control group. We're control, no doubt. - Then we might as well not take it. - Well, I never had to go through so few hoops. One questionnaire, one day's notice, bullshit. Who cares if it's a real pill or a sugar pill. Let's just take the damn thing. Do I make myself clear? - "Do I make myself clear?" Who made you boss man? - Just open the box. Take out the pill. (BEWITCHING MUSIC) (SNIFFING) - What one earth? - Looks like crystals. Ah! It's so pretty. - Seriously? What are doing? Stop, stop. Take the pill, come on. - What pill? - Oh em gee! What the hell? - You mean this one? - Oh God! - How did you do that? - It's magic. - Like for real? - Sure. - I don't know guys. This looks weird to me. We have to take it within a few seconds of each other. - It's literally the craziest thing I've ever seen. - Figuratively. - What? Let's all take the pill before this guy gets even more angry. - My name is Devin. And yes, let's take it already. I mean, I know my pills if you're catching my drift. - I don't. What do you mean? - Illegal drugs. - Really? - Yeah. Good, good. Now, just get it in your mouth. - You sounded more like my ex. That dirty bitch doing me before we quit. - This is truly special. - I don't care if you think it's special. And I don't care about your whore ex-wife. - Oi, I can say it, mate. You can't. - Calm down, Devin. I mean, have you ever seen anything like that before? - They're a business. What are they gonna do to us? All right, I'll calm down. Now, everyone let's take the pill. - You know what? I can't be late for this new club opening tonight. Word is, this amazing DJ is gonna be there... - Can we hold the chatter after we take the pill? - Why are you so desperate for us to take this? I just don't wanna be in here all day. - Okay, he's got a point. - Everyone, open your water. Come on. Three, two, one. - Not so bad, was it? - Oh, that tasted awful. - It was totally gross. - Smooth. (ELECTRONIC DOOR CLOSING) - Oh God! - Great, finally. - And so the fun begins. - Did you all see that? - See what? - Ah! Magic. - I didn't do anything that time. - Magic is all around us. It's time to relax. Enjoy the experience my wonderful brothers and sisters. Water for hydration. (XYLOPHONE PLAYING) - Well, he's odd. - I think I'm already feeling it. - There's no way it works that quick. - No, my claustrophobia. - Yeah, but you're here now and you're not leaving. Relax, it's not long. I've had bowel movements that last longer. - What? You've taken eight-hour shits? - It's how I got through Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. - Oh, you're a Harry Potter fan? Except I hate how they use time travel to save Buckbeak. And then not use it to save like, I don't know, every other loved character in the book. I just think as soon as we introduce time travel it becomes completely impossible. - You know it's not real, yeah? - Yes, I know it's not real. I'm in this alleyway behind a bar, right, with a couple of whores. - Is this a joke? One these whores, she's missing like half her leg. She said, "We're like run over by a train or something,". Isn't it a little bit too early for sex stories? - Well, actually I wouldn't mind hearing the rest. - So she does this... (PIANO PLAYING) (CALM MUSIC) - You're pretty good. - Three hours a day does that. (DRUM PLAYING) - Play a drum. Best way to get laid. - God, please stop. - (MUMBLES) Take off your pants. Take off your pants. - Would you shut up? - Better with a band anyway. - I find that hard to believe. - I liked it! - Thanks. - Hey guys. Look at all the effort that they've put in to make this place a fortress. - Especially considering the pill ain't gonna do shit. I bet it's like collector study. - You mean psychological study. What do you think they'd be studying? I see three women can't resist a lovely chap like myself. - Yeah, it's not that. - Maybe it's haunted. - Oh em gee! Don't say that. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) - Do you think they're in there watching? - Yep, guarantee it. (BREATHING IN WINDOW) - Oh! Bad luck. Well, at least now they know who's better at Tic-tac-toe. - Oh! Think of all the useful applications of that data. (BREATHING IN WINDOW) - Really? You're obsessed. And you need balls. - What? - There. Now, you're anatomically correct. - Ew! Rub that off. I don't wanna stare at a big dick all day. - Oh! She says she doesn't wanna stare at you all day. - Very funny. - Are we just gonna sit around? Can we do something? I wanna have fun. You guys. - Okay, I got an idea. Come on. Gather around. - Yes! - Let's play a game. - Wait, wait. Wait for me. - We'll play for my lucky pen. It's gold-plated. Worth $1,400. There's only seven in the world quite like it. - Well, you got my attention. - My name is John. Can I have your names, please? - Well, you know I'm Devin. But my friends call me JayZ, Jazz, Jezebel, the Jazz singer Jizz and Jazzy JJ. - What? They call you Jizz? - We'll call you Jenna. And? - I'm Nikki. - I'm LI Xu Yeng, but no one really likes saying that. So call me Lilly. - Lilly it is. What about you, big guy? - Just call me Giggles. Everyone else does. - Giggles. Really? Well, I haven't seen you giggle once. Wait, is it one of those ironic names like where you call a fat guy Slim or a tall guy Tiny? Keep that smile you'll find out why. - Okay. And you, my quiet friend? Hey buddy, what's your name? Hello? (BREAKING A BANANA IN HALF) Okay. We're gonna have to give him a name. How about Greg? - No way! I know like 50 Gregs and he is not a Greg. I think we should call him Blue Eyes. - I'm not calling him Blue Eyes. - Let's just call him Chilled Guy. - You're not really known for your creativity, are you? - He kind of reminds me of a guy I went to school with. His name was Corey. - Corey. I like it. - Yeah, my suggestion was fine. - Okay. Hand up for Chill Guy. Hand up for Corey. Corey it is. (COREY LAUGHING) Okay, the game is this. If you can beat me in a game of code reading, I will give you my shiny pen. - Oh my God! I am amazing at games. I literally never lose. - Literally? - Yep. - Okay, moving on. If you haven't noticed, I'm a magician, and a mentalist. And with only a few moments, and a glance, into your eyes, and your very soul, I can tell you everything there is about you. If I get you wrong, you get my pen. - Fuck it! I'm bored as shit anyway. You're not gonna get me. Come on. - Okay. This should be easy. You're an ex-con. You came here to start anew but it's hard to find work as an ex-con. So you do this test to pay the bills. The real question is, what'd you do that was so bad that you can't go home? It wasn't small time. It was big. And you didn't steal anything. - All right, just do someone else. - Do I get to keep my pen? - Yeah, fuck it! Keep your pen. - Wonderful. - Do her next. Drug problem, stripper, probably got a sugar daddy. - Um, excuse me! How dare you? I do not like gross, old men. - Oh, it's just not your day, is it? - Jenna. No, you don't have a sugar daddy. You're just a girl who doesn't want the party to end. But maybe you ran out of money and maybe your dad won't help you out this time. Either way, there's no way you could be a stripper. - Okay, first of all, you're amazing. And second of all, it's totally offensive to say I couldn't be stripper. Just for the record, I'd be an amazing stripper. Well, I'm really sorry that I offended you. Devin, you either just lost your job or you got a divorce. Both. - It's impossible. How could you know that? - Do I keep my pen? - How the hell... (BELCHING) - Excuse you. - Ew! - Sorry. Is that the pill? - I told you, mate. It's not the pill. - Oh, it just taste really off. (BELCHING) - Okay, moving on. Let's do the very mysterious Nikki. - Please don't do me. - Oh, you sound like the exact opposite of Giggles' ex-girlfriend. - Oi, I can say it. You guys can't. - Yeah. Seriously, John, not me. - Come on. You're the most intriguing person in here. - Yeah, and the most private. Just let it go, okay? - You guys seriously not getting that too? - Get what, mate? Put your hand over your mouth. - No, idiot. It's like an intense push of gas from your stomach. - I don't feel it. - I'll give you something to feel. - Goody! A penis joke. How often do you those actually get you laid? Maybe hangout with me after the test and you'll find out. - Oh God! That's awful. Maybe the pill worked on me first. It's like the gas, it's like a sulfur flavor. Just look after it. Let me know if you get it. - Well, I think I felt something in my boobs. No, wait. It's gone. I'm fine. - I felt the boob thing too. - Maybe this pill ain't so bad after all. - They're half your age. - What do you mean? Grass on the field. - Oh! - Okay. On that note, I'm gonna go throw up in my mouth and play some poker. Does anyone wanna join me? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Okay, what do you got? Nice. A royal flush. That never happens. Really? Nothing. - Aren't you impressed by how well I cheat? - Who gets impressed by cheaters? - It's a royal flush. I mean, how did I do it? - Who cares? One person cheats and it ruins the whole game. My dad used to cheat when we played Monopoly. - I thought that Australian girls love magic. I don't know what else I have to offer. - Well, you better think of something quick. I'm starting to lose interest. - Did you just admit that you're interested? - And the interest gone. - I must be off my game. It's only been an hour? - Maybe it's because you're having more fun than you think. - Maybe. So why are you doing this test anyway? You seem a little out of place. - I'm just a really big fan of science. - Just tell me. - Well, honestly? So I can meet you. - Sorry. Now, tell me or you'll get another one. - Okay, okay, okay. Have you ever played poker before and maybe lost more money than you had? - No. - Well, that makes one of us. - So why don't you just cheat? - I did. It didn't work out so well. - And now you're stuck in here with these guys. Serves you right. - Yeah, I think we definitely have chemistry. - No, you idiot. - I meant with the pill. - I knew what you meant and no. - I thought I was feeling something a bit. Maybe it's just in my head. I think Giggles might be right. I think it's a placebo. - I swear I just heard you say I was right. What's my price then? - Aw! I wanna knee you in the balls. - That's a good price. - It's not a placebo. I feel like shit. Getting that gassy taste in their mouth. - Give it up, mate. It's not the pill. Oh, do you find the inside of your mouth taste pretty unpleasant? Do you yearn for the taste of rotten eggs? Oh, your prayers have been answered. All new sulfur mouth wash. Don't leave home without it. Side effects include: Hair loss, anal leakage and homosexual dreams. - Oh all right. I get it. (BELCHING) - Are you okay? - Yeah, are you all done? - Don't get annoyed. - Just a bit of fun, mate. - Yeah, yeah. Very funny. (BODY EXPLOSION) (BURNING FLAMES) - Let me out! Let me out! - Open the fucking door! (BANGING ON THE DOOR) Open this fucking door! Open this fucking door! - He's become one with the air. (TALKING SIMULTANEOUSLY) - Wait! I can hear them. - Open the door. - Open up! - Oh my God! You have to let us out! - Why won't they open it? - Okay, come on! - Hey, Corey, whatever your name is. Help us. - Fuck him! - Push it! Push it! (MUMBLES) fucking get out of the way. - Look out! (ELECTRIC SURGE) - The fuck! - What was that? - Okay. We should just... - Oh my God! Oh my God! - Shh, shh, shh. They're gone. - Where did they go? - No, no, no. They're just figuring out how to open the door. - Open this fucking door! Can you see me? - Does anybody else have a gassy taste in their mouth? - Well, everyone just relax and take a deep goddamn breath? - Wait, wait. Can we all throw up? - No, the pill's in our body's too long. It's too late. Anyway we already saw it work which means it's a quick acting drug. I know these things. Trust me. - I'm getting us out of here. Fuck! (POUNDING THE WALL) What is this fucking place? - I'm not getting a signal. - You have your phone? - It's not getting a signal. - Get out of the fucking way. (POUNDING THE WALL) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) What is this fucking thing? - Help! Help! - Jenna, Jenna, please we're in a sound studio. The door is closed, all right? - So? - So? Are you serious? Nobody can hear you. I mean, where would you put a bunch of exploding people? - Seriously? I'm not even supposed to be here. Why does this have to be me? Tonight, this agent was gonna be there at this party. My dad... - Jenna, don't lose your shit! ( JENNA CRYING) There might be a way outta here. - Fuck me! Hey, over here. I found something. Give us your phone. Give us your fucking phone. - Don't like use all the battery. - Fucking hell. - Watch where you're going. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) - There's a door. - It's open. (DOOR OPENING) What the fuck! Fuck! Fuck! We're not getting out of here. - Well, I'm not giving up yet. Everybody, empty your pockets. - Guys, really, just relax. Come and sit with me, my friends. Let's meditate. - I got it. - What? Don't people always break out of prison with these things? - This isn't gold-plated. - Does that really matter right now? - Okay, so what's the plan? - Do we just... - No? They have to open the door after eight hours, right? - All right. - Devin exploded. And they bloody locked us in. - My parents don't even know I'm here. - Wait, nobody knows that I'm here either. I'm passing through town. What about you guys? - I'm passing through, too. - They fucking knew. - Does anyone have anybody that knows that you're here? Somebody that'll come for you? - They fucking knew. - Okay, seriously guys. - You're actually not allowed to do this. It is so illegal. When my dad finds out, I mean what the hell! You better open up right now! - Open up or you will seriously regret it! - Jenna, please. We get it. - No, John. I'm sorry, but no. You can't do this to people. This is literally the worst moment of my life. - Well, you're finally using literally right. - Chill out, babes. I'm seriously getting us out of here. (SCREAMS) - Did you all see that? Did anyone else see that? - What happened? How did I get here? - Magic. - Oh my God! Oh my God! - It looked like you... - What did I do? - Teleported. - What? What is that? What's a teleport? - I don't know. You tell me. I just, I didn't wanna fall so I had like a reflex to be somewhere else, and then I totally was. - That's impossible. - I can't teleport. Either you get the exploding pill or the teleport one. - If she can teleport, it means you can get us outta here. - Yes. - What? No, no. I don't know how I did it. I don't even know what it is. - Jenna. - No! No way. Ow! - Get your hands off her. - What the hell? - Help me teleport. - That really hurt you fucking douche fucker. - I didn't even do it. - Do not push me. That is so not okay. - You've already lost the power. Pretty shitty then. - You okay? - Jenna, you need to try and do it again. I mean just start small. Go from one side of the room to the other. - What if that's what Devin did and that's why he blew off? Plus, I don't know how. - I don't know how to teleport either, but you gotta give it a go. - Oh my God. I'm so fucking freaked. - No, no. You can do this Jenna. Come on. - Please, Jenna. (SIGHS) - Fucking come on! - Shut up! It's not that... easy. - You fucking beauty. - Amazing! You figured it out. - Yeah. It's hard to explain. It feels better the second time. - Amazing! - I might be able to control it. - There is a principle in quantum mechanics that says teleportation is theoretically possible but this, I mean, you realize you're the first person in history to do that. - Really? Am I gonna be famous? - Forget about famous. You just teleported. - Well, you're not gonna be anything if we're still stuck in here. Okay, I'll do it and then we are gonna kick some serious scientist ass. - Oh, don't teleport where someone is, yeah? Not where I'm standing? - Don't. Just don't. - I can do this, guys. - Yes, you can. - Okay. Actually, can I get some water first? - Yeah. - Okay. - Thanks. - Wait, Jenna. - Did I make something disappear from my face? What? Is there something on my face? Seriously, tell me. - The water. - Did you teleport this from somewhere else? - I don't know. I didn't feel at that time. - Technically, it's possible if teleportation is possible which I guess it is. - Oh, you bloody think. - What is this pill doing to me? - I don't know but I don't think we should wait to find out what it does to everybody else. We need to get out of here now. - Okay, you're totally right. Okay. I can do this. - Yes. - I'm just gonna do it and then I'm gonna home and take a serious fucking shower. - Yeah, that's a good idea. - Okay. - Don't fuck up, yeah? - Ah! Shit! It didn't work. (DRIPPING) What? Now, is there something on my face? Seriously, tell... (BLOOD DRIPPING) Oh no. - Jenna. - Jenna, put your arm back. - This can't be happening. - Jenna. - Teleport it back. Come on. Is she doing it? - Jenna. - No, no. - She's gone. - No. - You're fucking kidding me. - No. - The pill, it's killing us. - What have you done? - This can't be happening. Why is this happening? - Come on. Nothing to be done. Come on, John, let's clean this up. - Don't touch me! - Easy there, Johnny boy. She's gone. We'll just clean it up, eh? (LOUD THUD) - Hey, careful. - What? She can't feel it. She can't. When I teleport I'm gonna be good at it. Fucking airhead. I knew she'd stuff it up. - What is wrong with you? She is dead. - Five hours on the clock. - It feels like we've only been in here for an hour. Can I give you a hand? - No, it's pretty much done. (INSTRUMENTS CLICKING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) - Please stop doing that. Stop it. - I'm the only one smart enough to get us out of here. Always leading, always thinking for someone else. - Then do it quietly. - Can you stop being such a little baby? As soon as I learn to teleport, you'll be licking my balls in thanks. - Giggles, seriously stop. - Oh please, I'm gonna eat you for fucking breakfast. Why did you give her the pill? But you know what? Fuck you! (LOUD THUD) What's the point of your test now fuckers? - Hey, Giggly man, why are you so filled with anger? - Why don't you just fucking explode? No more fucking test. - Well, that's not very nice. (GLASS BREAKING) - Giggles, enough. You really think you can make the pill work? (BANGING ON THE DOOR) What the hell was that? (BANGING ON THE DOOR) - What's happening? - Some thing's coming through. - It's breaking. Come on fuckers. (MUMBLES) Come on and fight me you fuckers! (ANIMAL GROWL) Where did it go? - What was that? - I pissed them off. Good. Let them come in and deal with me. - That wasn't the scientist. - Oh no. It was me. - Oh, fuck me dead. Look what the pill did to you. And it's shit. You can turn water into different colors. You're like a shitty Jesus. - I didn't even try. I mean, I could feel it happening but I don't know, it's like this surge of power. - Can you control it? - I don't know. - You have magic inside of you. You're very lucky. - Excuse me? You think we're lucky? - Yeah. What is inside of us, it's out of this world. I think it's a gift. - Well, that gift just killed two people. - Well, not every gift is for every person, brother. Look, whatever's inside of us is more powerful than anything that any of us could ever imagine. And that's why we need to be careful. That's why we need to stick together as a group. - Where can they figure out how to give us abilities? We're like the new evolution of science. We're like the first super humans. - Superheroes. - Fucking superheroes. (HEAVY BREATHING) - Hey, are you all right? I guess the clock's began to tick on me. Probably not long to live. - You don't know that. - Two people in this room have had the pill work for them and they both died. It can't be controlled. If you get out of here, I need you to tell my dad that I was coming back. I just needed to get away. Just tell him I'm sorry. You gotta promise me you'll do that. - Sure. How would I find him? - John, stop playing dumb. You didn't just code read this group. I saw you. - Saw him do what? He sneaked in to a room and looked through our files. - You read our questionnaire? I had some really private stuff in there. - No wonder you knew all that shit about us. - No, you I guessed. - Dickhead. You have a big fucking dick on your head. And colorgirl. - Oh, how dumb is your fucking power? - Yeah, we'll see what you get. - I'm gonna choose my power. - Hey, what are you doing? - I choose that mind control one. - What? Telekinesis. - What did you call me? - It's the name of that power, dumbass. - What are you muttering? - Nothing. - None of that color bullshit or flying. Why does anyone wanna fly? And people don't know this. We can already fly. It's pretty inexpensive too. And you get a movie and a free meal. - That makes no sense. You don't get to choose. - What the fuck would you know? If I can move this pear, I can move anything. And I can open the door and I'm free. You know what I'm gonna do as soon as I get out? I'm gonna go straight down to the nearest bank and I'm gonna move that money straight into my pockets. I'm gonna pick out the prettiest girl, I'm gonna move her straight on the end of my knob. - So your plan is to rape people. - It's not rape. On the subject of telekinesis rape, are you? You know what? You could all sit around here with your dicks in your hands. I'm getting outta here. (THRILLING MUSIC) Fuck! - Don't throw food. - Nikki? - All this talk and I can't stop thinking about it. Oh, I think I need to use it. - Don't change people or nothing. I mean don't tell me black or any shit like that. - Just shut up. Hey, are you okay? Did you use it? Nothing happened. Just try again. - No, it worked. It gets easier every time. It feels good almost. - Shit. - Maybe that's what happened to Devin. He was using his power without even realizing it and blew himself up. Maybe Jenna didn't understand her own strength and... - Oh, I don't want anything. - Seriously, what is your problem? You have a chance of being a superhero. And you're just staring there like a whiny little bitch. - Settle down, Giggles. - No, I'm sick of this fucking whinging. We maybe stuck in here but we're one pair away from being so fucking brilliant. And all I ever hear from you is "wa, wa, wa, wa, wa." - Leave me alone. - Beautiful. - I felt it. So I just made it happen. - You're another teleporter. - No, I don't think so. I don't know. But I'm pretty sure I can... - Yeah. - I think I can travel back in time. (THRILLING MUSIC) - Can you say that again? You can travel back in time? - Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Pretty cool, hey. I can go back. Do things different. Friends, school, I'd go back to Forest Greg Camp I won't be "pee pee Lilly" anymore. - What the fuck? You can go back in time and not a word of thanks? I got that power out of you. You're like Back to the Future. That's a good power. You could learn a lot from her, Colorgirl. - Don't call me that. You know that's gonna be your shitty superhero name, yeah? - Lilly, can you do it again? - I mean I guess if I could I already would've. Hi. Well, I guess I did. So cool. I've been so into time travel my whole life. And now I can actually do it. - Listen, the pill is asking us to make changes, right? It's given us all the tools: Time, gas, movement. And if you can control it, you could fix the world. With any ideas about what's going on in this fucking room. - I mean the second time it happened it felt amazing. It was like I could choose exactly when I went and where. - You can control it already? - Where do I go? - Oi, go back before the World Cup. I know all the results. We'll make a fucking million! Wouldn't you still be stuck in here? I haven't thought the whole plan for it yet, John. Have I? - Of course. Lilly, you could go back in time and you could tell us not to do the experiment. I mean, that way Jenna and Devin would still be alive. - I don't think you understand how time travel works. Like I might be able to visit the past but that doesn't mean I can manipulate the future. I'd be playing with an infinite number of variables. - How do you know all this? - This is just the stuff I know. On the weekends, you drink and have fun. This is what I do. - You should not play with time, Lilly. You can only seek salvation by moving forward. Don't do it, my little sister. - Maybe I could even go back to before I was born. Like I could look at a picture of Einstein and go back to the moment it was taken and meet him. He'd be so blown away. Wait. And I tell him all about the theory of relatively, and then he just tells people he came up with it. Maybe I'm Einstein. - Fuck! Tell me to come steal the pill but not go in the room. - What? - I just want an ability, all right? This pill is sexist. I mean superheroes are supposed to be men. You have no idea of the effects you could have outside of this room. - But we won't see the other side of this room. - I just don't think it will work. There are three common types of time travel: Fixed, multiverse, and dynamic. I just strongly believe in a fixed timeline. - Sorry. Can you explain all this? - Okay. Just say time travel works on a fixed timeline basis. That means that time operates as a static line. When I go back, we can deviate from this line. In fact, it goes so far as to say that any change I could make has already happened. So if it's a fixed timeline, I could already gone back hundreds of times and tried to save us. We're also standing here right now. With Novikov's self-consistency principle. - I couldn't agree more. - Fuck! - Ow! Stop doing that. - Oh my God. - So I guess you can all see me again. - Okay, just say my dad is killed in a robbery. I go back in time to when the thief is a baby and kill him to save my dad. - Where did he come from? - to the future, my dad is still dead, still killed in the same robbery. - Lilly, a guy just appeared in the room. - Don't you get it? After I kill the thief, his parents adopt another kid to fill the boy. A kid who grows up, all messed up, becomes a thief and kills my dad. - What the fuck is going on here? - Nothing can change once it's happened. If it's a fixed timeline then we're stuck here. I mean, how do you change what's already happened? - Who the fuck are you? - Seriously? None of you this time? Phil Gaylord, out of work sales rep. - Is that your real name? - Am I the lord of the gays? You've said that thing countless times. - No, I haven't. - Yes, you have. You all know me. Every time I come back you all seem to know a little less. Nikki, I just hoped you clean up after Jenna. We talked about going home. - There's no way. I've never seen you before. - Come on. You know me, Nikki. You've known me for most of your life. We grew up together. I used to walk you home. - I don't know what to say. I have no idea who you are. - I've been doing this stupid test for you, so you can't run away on me again. - Excuse me? - You're dating this guy? - No. - I'm gonna save you, Nikki. Don't you worry. I'm getting us out of here. You'll come home with me. I'll take care of you. - What is wrong with you? You know nothing about me. - I know everything about you. I know why you ran away. - I know about the accident. - Shut up! - It wasn't your fault. You didn't even say goodbye. Me and your father have been looking for you for two years. And I'm getting you out of this room and I'm taking you home. - How could you know that? - This ability. It's getting so powerful. - So you're in here from the very start? - I took the pill the same time as you, it just worked on me immediately. - What is your superpower exactly? - I turn invisible, obviously. At first, I thought you guys were just ignoring me. Then I started screaming at you. I even tried touching you. I thought you're feeling the pill. - Yes, yes. - You touched us? So where did you touch us? - It doesn't matter. Anyway, I lost control of it. I kept popping in and out. I got so powerful so quick. Before I knew it, I was starting to be erased from your minds. - Guys, listen! It could be a multiverse. That means that every time I travel back I create a new reality. In those realities we might be safe. But in this one here and now, we're still stuck in the room. No, I've already travelled and seen myself in this reality. So it can't be. It's gotta be fixed or dynamic. - You're not at all interested in this idiot. - Hey. - Sorry, I'm just a bit jealous. And (MUMBLES) I'd say with your powers. What if I use it again and I'm erased from existence, Wait a second, have you guys not noticed jumps in time? I mean you forget every conversation you have with me. You basically skipped that moment in history like it never happened. That explains why it feels we've only been here for such a short time. - I remember you. - Do you think maybe you might wanna have mentioned that? You need to discover your own path, brother. Besides, I didn't know if you were coming back. So it didn't seem worth scaring the group. If you're invisible, just walk through the door. - That's not what invisible means. I've told you this. I'm still stuck in here just like you. Nobody can see me. - Maybe your powers a bit shit then. - Yeah, that would be right. - Guys, stop worrying about Mr. Invisible. I might be able to get us out of here. - Jesus. - There's one more option. It's the most dangerous and it's also the most unlikely. - So I really punched you, yeah? - You told me it's a prison reflex. - Yeah, it is. (MUMBLES) from bum raping you. - Guys, shut up. Listen to Lilly. Do you have any idea what it's like to disappear? - Dynamic. This is where shit gets crazy. It poses that if I go back I can impact this moment. I tell us not to go into the room and we don't. - Fucking awesome. - But if I do that, I could create a paradox. And I kinda might wreck the whole universe. - What will the paradox be? - Okay, well, if I go back in time and tell myself not to take the pill, then I don't take the pill and tell myself not take the pill. And what if the new me doesn't push out the old me and I just keep creating duplicates of myself. I mean guys this is heavy. - No, just don't stuff up, what's her name? - Her name was Jenna. - What if I create an infinity loop and taking the pill and keep going back and taking the pill and keep going back and taking the pill. I can't do it. No, I can't do it. We can't. - Lilly, you have a chance to save us. You've gotta try. - You can do this, Lilly. - What the fuck? - Lilly, you might be our only hope of getting out of here. I know it's not fair to put that on you. - I'm just scared, okay? I will have done nothing with my life. There's so much. I did this test so I'd have money to go to Comic-Con. I just wanted to hangout with people like me. - What? Other little weirdoes? - Shut the fuck up. You misogynistic, homophobic, self-centered asshole. Nobody cares what you think. You stupid, dumb, fucking loser. - All right. - Okay, I'll do it. I'll see you on the other side of that door, otherwise if any of you get the same power say hi to Einstein for me. - You can do this. - I know. Guys? Guys? Guys. Guys? Are you still here? Stop. No. Oh my God. How did I get here? Stop! Who are you guys? What the hell? Stop! Where am I? Help! Guys, we're creating an infinite loop. You need to stop. What's going on? (SIMULTANEOUS TALKING) Stop! - I fucking knew it. - Fuck! Fuck! - What does it mean? - I don't know. - It can't end like this. - Maybe your power will be to break through doors and get us out of here, huh? What happened? - Old baseball injury. - You lie more naturally than you tell the truth. Oh God. - Guys, I owe money to are very serious about me paying them back. - And if you can't? - Let's just worry about one thing possibly causing my death at a time. Are you okay? (DEEP BREATHING) - It's just the power. I don't feel so good. I just need a minute to clear my head. - Yeah. (SLOW EERIE MUSIC) - Okay. I have always loved you. - Who the fuck! - What happened? You okay? John? What? What is it? Do your insides feel weird? Did you find your power? - I don't know. (PAPER RUSTLING) I think I'm losing my mind. Are you serious? But I'm gonna be ready and looking good. - What is it? - Looks like our friend over here sees himself as a bit of a superhero. - It's not finished, is it? - Do I like it's my idea to make fun of me, does it? - Okay. Okay. Here. (PAPER RUSTLING) The Giggler. - What did I just say? - Stop! Stop it! Stop it you fucking idiots. - Fuck me. How about that? I just got my ability. - What is it? I don't have to breathe. - You don't need to breathe? Hold your breath. - Well? - I think he's right. - Wait a minute. I don't have to breathe. Fuck me! I'm like Aquaman. - Who? - Aquaman. We used to have these comics in prison. I fucking hated him. He's a superhero that can swim with the fishes. He's basically the most boring superhero ever. - Still gonna call yourself The Giggler? - I can't even swim. I'm like a shitter than shit Aquaman. - You probably can't even communicate with fish. So you're like shitter than a shit shit Aquaman. - Oh, you suddenly got a sense of humor, have you? - Hey, I'd love to communicate with the fishes. I think Aquaman's an amazing superhero. - Why are you here, Corey? Why would you take a pill for science when you're into energy and all that shit? Why are you fucking here, Corey? - Hey, just relax. Take a deep breath. Oh wait, you can't. (LAUGHING) - It's not funny. - Yes, it is. - I want a better power. I want a better power. I want a better fucking power. - The universe works in mysterious ways. There is no chance. It's just an infinite story, lad, where you're gonna get what you deserve to get. - Guys, the clock. We're gonna get out of here. - Eight hours already. - We're here until the universe wants us to be here. - Seriously, suck a bag of dicks, Corey. (CLOCK TICKING) Watch out world, The Giggler is coming. (LAUGHING) Well, chose a name then. (CLOCK TICKING) Fucking hell! Get me out of this fucking hell! I knew that door wouldn't open until those geeks saw exactly what we're capable of. By my count, I think we've got two powers we haven't seen yet. You and that fucking freak. If you would do a drug test, you don't open that door until you see exactly what that pill does. That's how we get out of here, isn't it? - Giggles, you're scaring me. You think I give a fuck about you? I have killed people for looking at me the wrong fucking way. That door doesn't open until we show them our powers. So let's show them our powers right fucking now! - Giggles, stop. - Yeah, why don't you relax? All those stress is making you unpleasant. - I'm fucking done with you. I've been watching him. He just looks and spies all day long. - No, I've been meditating. - No, you haven't. You've been practicing. - No, I'm meditate everyday. Just like any other day I'm here. - Show me your fucking power. I don't feel so good. - What are you doing? - This is amazing. - Giggles. - It gets better. - What are you doing? Giggles, stop it. - It gets more powerful. - Stop right now! - Giggles, what are you doing? Stop it! - Tell me your power. - I wouldn't do that. - Tell me your fucking power. Tell me your powers you little fucking shit. (CHOKING) - Stop it! - Are you doing this? Are you playing with the lights? It's so powerful. - Stop, Giggles. You're killing him. - It gets more powerful each time. I can control the air. Can you feel that, Corey? - Giggles. - Can you feel this, Corey? Can you feel all the air just leaving your lung? Tell me your fucking power. - Listen to me, Giggles, please. Stop it! - Fucking idiot. I'm so powerful. It's fucking amazing. Do you know why they call me Giggles, John? Because no matter what sick shit they gave me in prison, I just smiled and laughed at them. Do you understand? You can't fuck with me. Is this turning you on? Is this turning you on? Let me show you what this pill can do. I'm the superhero in this room. I win. (EXPLODING) (DEEP BREATHS) - You found your power. - I don't understand. - Are you okay? - No. He's gone. Trust me. That was you. What's your power? - I can change things. All things. - I got it seconds after taking the pill. You see, I felt something immediately because I live a pure lifestyle. - Why didn't you tell us? - Because I needed to discover what was inside of me. I mean, I wish you could see what I see, brother. Feel what I feel. I have become a God. And I will be good. I will be so good. - You've been using your powers from the beginning. It's too dangerous. You see, that's where you're wrong. I was eating an apple when I first felt it and then suddenly I was eating a banana. You see, the thing is I can change matter. It starts small but then it gets, I mean it gets wow. And now, I mean now I've gone so far beyond matter. I understand the language of nature. I see the code that makes up the entire universe. It's so beautiful. - It's great that you can see the code. Can we please just get out of this fucking room? - No. No, that's simply not an option. I mean that's too dangerous. That's why I moved the room. - You what? - I moved the room. After Devin exploded, I had to make sure that no one could leave. Can you imagine if a man like Giggles was allowed outside this room? The damage he would do? Don't you get it? I made the door impossible to open. I surrounded us by brick. I moved us to a safe location and I left an empty room in its place. To see the look on those stupid scientists' faces when they walked into an empty room. Oh, and Lilly, I guess that must have been a little bit confusing for her. Oops! - Where the fuck are we? And who was trying to get in? About that, I wanna be completely honest with you. You see, when I moved the room at first, I was still working on my powers. That might have been a pack of wild animals or something. Either way, it's okay. I moved us again. We're all good now. - I just wanna go home. - I know you do. I know but I feel I should explain something. You see these underground trials they have been going on for years. I mean they do these secret tests on desperate people like you guys and they trial these goddamn drugs and they don't care how dangerous they are. See, I've been trying to get one of these for months. Blow the lid off the whole thing. Show the world that everything we need we get from nature. It's a sign from the universe that I was put in this test that I took that pill. I am worthy of this mission and I accept. - You're worthy? - You were chosen. John... we were chosen. And everyone failed. Except me. - Could you open the door, please? Please, I'm begging you. - No. No, you see being a god means making some hard decision. You see, I sat just over there and I watched everything everyone did. And none of you all have the ability to control or the purity I do. So I can't risk it. And the universe certainly can't risk it. I'm sorry. I really am. (SCREAMS) - What the fuck was that? - Who was that? - That was Phil. He was never gonna be special. - You killed him? - Don't see it as death. Please, I'm so beyond that now. I wish you could come with me. I really do. I promise I'm gonna turn you into something beautiful. Beautiful. But you, John... You're the worst of them all. (ELECTRICITY SURGE) (SCREAMING) - I had to. It's just us now. - Thank you. You saved me and I don't deserve it. - Of course you do. You're good, John. - No. It's not true. I really needed this money. And I heard a guy talking about the trials so I... - So what did you do? - I knocked him out. Stole his identity. - Your name isn't John, is it? How many lies have you told me? - Just one more. (DEEP BREATHING) - What's wrong? - It doesn't feel right. It's too much it hurts. - What's happening? - It doesn't hurt anymore. - I guess I really wasn't meant to be a superhero. - No. Nikki, no. Don't leave me in here alone. Nikki. Don't leave me here alone. (SOFT MUSIC) What have you got for me? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Give me something to fix this.
