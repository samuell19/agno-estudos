"In the last episode," "Ji Gong banded together with various heroes" "and once again saves the world." Please select your troops, Your Majesty. Greetings, Your Majesty... Good, everyone's here. Go on earth with Taming Dragon Arhat to take care of that Peng Bird of whatever. Thank you, Your Majesty. Let's do this. I'll go first! Fight! Taming Tiger Arhat! I am not Taming Tiger Arhat. I am the top guard of Master Giant Peng, White Tiger. No... Ji Gong... Are you gods all blind? Why did you make her suffer so much? Why are good deeds not rewarded? If such are your so-called heavenly principles, I am going to go against all of them! The dragon returns! What is it, Master? Where's your Master Dao Ji? I haven't seen him today. How do I treat you usually? Most kind and merciful. Do me a favor. Go on. Who do you want to hurt? Collect all evidence on your Master Dao Ji on drinking, eating meat and skipping morning class. Anything should be good enough to get him kicked out of Lingyin Temple. - Want to get me kicked out again? - Yes. I have always respected you as my senior. How could you do this to me? Respect isn't just talk, but this as well. Bi Qing. See? Is that all? Fine, I'll play. Come on. That's too low! Then don't respect me. Isn't this going a bit too far? Fine. Seriously, just for you. Will this do? That's more like it. Senior. I'm stuck. Stuck? Senior, help me out. Help me. Thanks. Thanks... Let me do a magic trick for you. No need to get violent. Close the door. Don't let him get away! - Stop. Don't run! - Come on... - Catch me if you can! - Stop! Don't run... Got you! Where are you trying to go? Morning. Peng Bird? Take this! Arhat Heavenly Palm! Have I got stronger or has he got weaker? That was only 20% of my power. The demon of his generation finally got what he deserved. Amitabha... Call the authorities on your Master Dao Ji. He just killed someone. What? There's a ton of witnesses here. Even I can't help him. Don't worry, I'm fine. He's not dead yet. Hit him again! Getting on it! Show yourself, Peng Bird! I am not Peng Bird. I'm just an ordinary human now. I'll make you show your true colors. I've turned over a new leaf. There's no demonic aura at all. What should I do? Whatever. Where are you, Master? Where is Master? Don't move. You not only have no demonic aura, even your essence is gone. My essence was taken by Netherworld Demon. I am a mere human now. I want to start a new life. Please take me as your apprentice, holy monk. You... The powers of Buddha are boundless. Even a giant demon like you wants to turn over a new leaf too. All right. Since destiny brought us together, work under me... No, study under me from now on. Really? I... But the name Peng Bird is just too terrible. It makes me want to beat you up. Let's call you... Shuang Yue from now on. I like it. It's good... You don't ask for much, do you? - Master! - Master! Master, when are you coming back? Everyone is waiting for their leader. I'm back! Commander Gao is back victorious! Commander Gao is back victorious! Commander Gao... Commander Gao... Commander Gao... Commander Gao is back... Commander Gao... I will wait for your return. Commander, what's wrong? Nothing. Master Zhang! Hello... Commanders, I've arranged a welcome reception for you today. I'm so honored. I've arranged our best girls for you. They are all ethereal and stunning, and will dance for both of you. If any of our girls happen to catch your eye, just let me know. I will make sure both of you are satisfied and have a good time here. Come on. Enjoy yourselves. Come on. This way, please. Commander Gao. Come, have a seat. Brother Gao, I made this. A swan? I heard a swan only has one partner in its life. No matter how far its partner may be and how long it has been away, it will keep waiting for an entire lifetime, forever loyal. I promise you, no matter how far I go, I will return for you. Brother Gao. Do you know how much I miss you? Do you know how unwilling I am for this to happen? However, you are a commander now, a hero, while I... am just a working girl. I am no match for you. Brother Gao, I am sorry. Enough! Why? Why? Commander Gao, the night is short. Commander... Where are you going? Tell me! I'll go back to bed after using the bathroom. You aren't going anywhere. Come back in. Go out and take a look. Waking people up in the middle of the night? You deserve a good beating. Crazy Ji, it's you. Listen. Have you noticed a lot of strange sounds in the temple lately? Those sounds are so scary. Yes... And you call yourselves devout monks. Even if you run into any of those things, you should nurture them, help them pass over to the next life, and embrace them. Embrace them? You just said to embrace them, but now you're embracing me. Senior, do you know what you lack compared to the temple master? What? Credibility. You need to catch some demons and ghosts to win everyone over. - This is your chance. - Really? Why did you hit me? Hold that... I just passed my powers on to you. Do you feel nothing but pain inside now, and no fear at all? Seems like it. I feel taller as well. Hurry up and go! Wait, Master seems to be... Master, you... Stay out of it. - So? - Something doesn't seem right. Why does it hurt so much? Maybe I didn't pass on enough power to you. Goodness... Why did you hit me again? It should be enough now. Go! - No... - Don't go... - He doesn't need help. - No. Help Master. He can't do it. - What? - It's not working. It's really hurts... each time more than the last. My fear is also back. Really? That's perfect. You proved something crucial for me. What? He's human, not ghost. Really? Thank you for doing this experiment with me, Senior. You'll be temple master soon. Amitabha. Excuse me, is there a holy monk called Master Dao Ji? That's me. Holy monk. Sir, those who weep in the middle of the night is either troubled over money or women. You are most wise, holy monk. Say no more. Let me see. Money troubles? No. It's a woman. What happened? Tell me. I had a very close childhood friend, but a few years passed, and now she's completely changed. Holy monk, should I keep loving her? Let go... I can't check this way. Goodness me. How about this? Go with my Senior, who you beat up so badly, to a place tomorrow. Then you will understand. What about you, holy monk? I have something more important to do, of course. All right? Amitabha. Thank you, holy monk. Old Man Under the Moon! Get out here! Do you have no self-disrespect? I swear I'm going to beat you up! Get out here! What's the matter? Why are you hiding in there? Get out here. Hold on. Let me tie this first. Hello, nice to meet you. You're quite tall. Are you new? Yes. I see. You are... Old Man Under the Moon. Right... I'm... Dao Ji. Are you a beggar? Well... I'm not a beggar. So picky. I don't have time for this. Why are you here? I'm not here to beg. I'm here to settle a grudge. That's right. I'm here to settle a grudge. Die! Punch... Punch... Let go! I quit. Tell me, what did you do with Gao Renjie and Feng Yi's red string? Goodness me. I remember. Really? Gao Renjie. Look at me! It should be this one. Yes, that's it. You broke it? It wasn't me. It really wasn't. You must have been slacking off. I wasn't. There are many reasons a red string may break. Understand? Destiny isn't decided by merely a red string. Even if they are destined for each other, their fate may not be so. - Well... - I don't care! As long as the red string is not tied to someone else yet, I'll find a way to get them together. Is he crazy? Master. Why did Master Dao Ji send us here? He didn't say. All he told me was to bring you here, and everything will become clear. That's cryptic. He's always been like that. Master. It's so prosperous here. There's a bank and a school. Let's go inside for a look. Bright moonlight shines before my bed, Is it frost on the ground, as I suspect? I raise my head to gaze at the bright moon, and lower it in thought of my hometown. This poem is about a poet who is nostalgic for his hometown when he can't sleep at night. Commander Gao! Commander Gao. Excuse me... Are you Commander Gao? You are... I'm your teacher, Mr. Chan. - Mr. Chan? - Yes. You're so much fatter. Yes, I am. Mr. Chan... Chief! - Who is here? - Chief. He is Commander Gao Renjie. Gao Renjie? Gao Renjie, you... are so much taller. Chief? Are you the village chief of Feng Yi's village? I am. Is this the village she grew up in? It's changed so much. Yes. It's changed so much. Even Feng Yi has changed too. She has become so materialistic. Chief's Iron Palm is as good as ever. Of courrse. Serves you right. Don't you slander our savior! Go on... How dare you, Gao Renjie? How dare you say such nonsense when you don't know anything? If it wasn't for Feng Yi, who knew what this village would be like now? Through those war-torn years, all the men were taken to war. Only the elderly, women and children were left in the village. There was no one working in the fields. It was common to go for days without food. Feng Yi was so kind and couldn't bear to see anyone starve. She didn't want to see the villagers suffer, even if she had to go hungry. One day, brothel owner passed by our village. She saw how pretty Feng Yi was, and found out she could dance, so she told Feng Yi she would have all she needed if she went with her to the city. At first, Feng Yi refused, but when she heard it could alleviate the villagers' suffering, she reluctantly left with the brothel owner. Over the years, Miss Feng Yi sent us every penny she earned, building the school, buying cattle, constructing infrastructure. Even the bridge you are on now was funded by Miss Feng Yi. We can't even imagine what the village would be like without Miss Feng Yi. That's right. I used to weigh 50kg. Now I weigh 100kg. This is all Miss Feng Yi's doing. Amazing. She sacrificed herself for us. Do you think she did it for herself? So I'd never allow anyone to slander Miss Feng Yi! All right... What a noble deed. Miss Feng Yi is a rare breed. She is Buddha on earth. Amitabha. "Yi-Ren Steele" I get it. I get it. I get it! Feng Yi... He finally gets it. What did he get? Then I don't get. "Drunken Night Estate" Come on, dress up nicely. You haven't had business in days. What a waste of my money. What a surprise, Commander Gao. Good morning. We haven't open for business yet though. I'm here to see Feng Yi. Commander Gao, that's... rather inappropriate. - That's right. - Inappropriate. Tell Feng Yi to come out. Guards! Coming... Who would dare stop me? Step aside! Move! I will. I want to see Feng Yi. Do you think you can see her whenever you want? She doesn't want to see you. I just want to say a few words. This isn't the army camp. No one will listen to you. Feng Yi! If you can hear me, I just want to say sorry. I was wrong about you. I want to apologize in person. I will be back! Who are you? Don't be afraid. I am Dao Ji from Lingyin Temple. Amitabha. Holy monk. Is something the matter? Of course! Commander Gao realized he was wrong and came all the way to apologize. Why did you refuse to see him? I can't. Why not? I saw from your expression that you really like him. That's not important. Then what is? Holy monk, you may not know this, but Brother Gao is a great hero now, while I'm just a working girl. I am no match for him. All humans are equal before the Buddha. What era are we in now? Why are you so outdated? Holy monk, people talk. How would the public view him if I got together with him? How would the court treat him? I can't do it. I can't ruin him for my own happiness. I can't ruin the people's hope. What's wrong, holy monk? Slow down, holy monk. I'm fine. Holy monk. I'm fine... I was just... It was so touching. I was stunned. I'm sorry. Your love for Commander Gao is so selfless and noble. I, Dao Ji, bow to you. Holy monk, you flatter me. No, I truly mean it. Don't worry, good deeds will be rewarded. Miss Feng Yi refused to see you last time all because you are too unromantic. All girls like guys who are gentle and considerate. That's why we have prepared some special training for you, so the next time you see her, you can hit your mark at once. As the ancient saying goes, when your eyes meet and sparks fly, you will know it's the right person. So that's important. Come on, try it. Feng Yi, I... Commander Gao. Why did you punch me, Commander Gao? I'm sorry, Master. Whenever I see you, I just can't control myself. Go, Master! I can't hold back much longer! If tenderness doesn't work, that's all right. We have another move. Push her girl discreetly against the wall and confess your love up close. Then she'll have no choice but to hear you out. Right? Try it. Feng Yi. In case she gets away even up against the wall, you have no choice but to use this last move, to grab her hands and confess your love to her. Remember, the key is to tell her what you want to say deep inside your heart, and you should be unstoppable. I understand. Go on, try it. Feng Yi! Don't leave me! Get away from me! Thank you for your teachings, masters. I will do my best. After a series of diabolical training, you clearly haven't learnt anything. So tomorrow... Good luck. Won't you go with me tomorrow? Oh, no. We have to see the doctor. Let's go. Hurry. Right. That way. Sorry... We are not open yet. No one will serve you. Feng Yi won't see you. Xiao Ya, stop him! Why are you back again? I told you Feng Yi won't see you. You'd have to get past me to get to her. Please, let me go up to see her. Let him up. Just say it. Don't you want to talk to me? Why did you close the door? I'm too ashamed to face you. I feel braver with the door closed. Go on then. Feng Yi, I am sorry. The holy monk took me to your village. I understand everything now. Not only did I not consider your situation, I accused you wrongly and even hit you. I feel so ashamed. I don't know if you'll ever forgive me, but there is something I've always wanted to tell you. Feng Yi, no matter what, I love you. Brother Gao. Brother Gao. Commander, I haven't seen you lately. What kept you so busy? Some personal matters. Whatever it may be, we have to set out tomorrow. That soon? Push it back three days. I still have things to do. Commander, His Majesty sent out orders long ago for us to return to court. We must obey. Are you threatening me with His Majesty? I wouldn't dare, but His Majesty's orders must be obeyed. A commander's decision trumps all when in the field. I am the commander. My word is law! Commander, military matters are of the utmost importance. Neither of us can take responsibility for any delay. I will explain everything to His Majesty. Don't worry about it, and stay out of it. The people are suffering and in danger every day. For this country... Are you going to abandon them? I've risked my life so many times. We both have crucial duties... Who'd dare say I was wrong? You should be prepared to sacrifice yourself anytime. I can sacrifice myself, but I don't want those I love to sacrifice anymore! - I... - Enough! It's settled. It's late. You should go. You... Five years, and this tree is still the same, just like before. It's time for the swans to reunite. I will never leave you again. Let me take care of you. It must be that woman. Come with me. Capture that woman from Drunken Night Estate! What is going on? Miss Feng Yi? Master Dao Ji! Master Dao Ji! Master Dao Ji! - Master. - Be quiet. What are you yelling about? I was delivering these gifts to the Commander's residence when I saw Vice Commander Huang leading a team of men to capture Miss Feng Yi. If that's true... Shuang Yue, go get Miss Feng Yi. Senior and I will go and find Commander Gao. We'll meet up at Fall Pavilion three miles from here. Master. A brothel? I've never been to a brothel in my life, and I don't even know what Miss Feng Yi looks like... Go! What are you looking at? Let's find Commander Gao. Yes... Let's go. Hurry. You still haven't told me what Miss Feng Yi looks like. Get out of my way! How dare you? What horse was that? Let's go! How do I stop? Who can help me stop? I've finally stopped. Who are you? Sister Feng Yi? Sister Feng Yi. Do you know how hard I looked for you? Someone is coming... She... is Feng Yi. She... You should have said so. Sister Feng Yi, do you know how hard I looked for you? Someone is coming to kill you. You must come with me now. Come on. What are you doing? I'm not going. I'm not going. I'm waiting for Brother Gao to take me. Vice Commander Huang is coming with a team of soldiers to come and kill you. You must come with me, or your life will be in danger. Let's go! I'm not going. I'm waiting for Brother Gao to take me. Listen, stop going about this like a sappy romance novel! If you don't come with me now, your life will be in danger! Come with me! No! I'm waiting for Brother Gao to take me! Hey. She left in the end. Everyone else, guard the door. The two of you, come with me. Slow down. Are there any other exits? Yes. I have to wait for Brother Gao! Stop! Don't run! Stop! - Let me go. - Based on the usual script, you should twist your ankle now. Watch out! I really twisted my ankle. I haven't even finished saying that. Hurry up and go. They will catch up soon. It's dangerous. Go! Why aren't you going? Go! Why should I? They are after you, not me. Are you going? Just leave me. Come on! Wait. Based on the usual script, now that you've twisted your ankle, their arrows should get to us before they do. Go after them! Let's go! This plot is deep. Not many can come up with it. You... Why are you hurt even worse than me? What should we do now? What should we do? Help me up first. - Right... - Thanks. Stop! Run! Don't move. Give the woman to us. Commander Gao has lost his mind over her. Don't even think about it! Stay away. Stay away... Stay away. I'm dangerous. Stay away... Stay away. They keep coming closer. Hurry... Come on, hurry... Wait for me... Help! Somebody help! Feng Yi. Feng Yi. Wake up. Feng Yi! I'm sorry. I failed to protect Miss Feng Yi. Commander Gao, I'm sorry. Her death may not be a bad thing. Are you gods all blind? Why did you make her go through so much suffering? Why are good deeds not rewarded? If this is your so-called heavenly principles, I, Taming Dragon Arhat, am going against all of them! The dragon returns! I'm too late. You got so much faster. Just a bit faster. Again. Again! The dragon returns! Run faster! Who's talking? Who's telling me to run faster? Feng Yi... - Still too late. What should I do? - Wake up. Calm down... I can do it... Again! What happened? What happened to your fan? Is there anything else you can do? You always have more ideas. No. I have an idea. Even turning back time didn't work. What is your idea? Let's go to Black Wing Fortress. What is it? Everyone has to pass through it before going to underworld. As long as we get there and get Miss Feng Yi's essence back, she will be saved. Lead the way then. Hold on. Your fan is just a pen now. Can you do this without your powers? I don't care. I must go to Black Wing Fortress, no matter what. Let's go. What are these floating blobs? These are all essences heading to Black Wing Fortress. Master Dao Ji, remember, once this incense burns out, Miss Feng Yi's essence will dissipate. Let's hurry then. There's a Netherworld Demon in Black Wind Fortress who feeds on essences. He must have Miss Feng Yi. Have you seen him before? Of course not, otherwise I wouldn't be here. True. Someone's there. Let's ask her. Hello, ma'am. Stop! What did you call me? I'll give you another chance. Go on. Be polite. I'm sorry, Miss. You... Get out! Exit's that way. Show yourself out. I can't do it. Go on. Please stay calm. May I ask... if you are... I'm... a demon. Demon... Well, we would like to ask for an essence from you. Essence? What is that? Didn't you say you are a demon? That's right. A low-level demon. I'm still a demon. Are you looking down on me? Yes... Let me remind you... "I dominate over China," "I reign supreme, I cause a stir." "You're conquer the elements of nature," "staking your claim, gaining victory." "Who are you? Who is he?" "Who is he to you? Who are you to him?" "Are you man or ghost? Are you good or evil?" "How dare you come to me dressed like a beggar?" "How dare you pose as the hero" "with this idiot by your side?" "Let me tell you, you can't afford to offend anyone here." "Now I've talked long enough," "it's your turn now." Master Dao Ji. What did he say? I'm not sure, like someone's posing as hero, but is actually an idiot. Idiot? I don't see any. Are you really asking? You smell so good. You stink. Come with me... You're so mean! Come on. Guests arriving! Where's your king? Our king can't be summoned at will. Let me call him. Hurry up. Be patient. Here he is. Are you looking for me? Sorry. Hello... He's the demon king? Hello... This is our demon king. Netherworld Demon. - Yes... - Hello... What's your name? I am a monk, Dao Ji. Amitabha. Hello... Hello, Mr. Dao. Boss... You're playing it wrong. Intimidate... Intimidate them. Hello, Brother Ji... Yes... What should I call you? Shuang Yue. Brother Yue, hello. May I ask how I can help you here? They said they want Miss Feng Yi's essence. Yes... Her essence is here, just inside... However, this is my territory, so we'll play by my rules. If you can win against me, I'll return her essence to you. "Gentlemen, you don't come and go as you please in Black Wind Fortress." "This is my territory," "not your godly paradise." "The flow in this underworld," "you will never get the hang of." "How dare you come and act so arrogantly?" "Darn you," "let the Netherworld Demon make you feel the heat," "you're way out of my league." "Is Ji Gong the best" "the gods have to offer? No sweat." "Rap from the dark side" "oozes with arrogance." "Don't bother saving anyone, Ji Gong." "Get back to begging on the streets." "What you want is in my hands." "Rather than giving up too much to save others," "go back and mind your place." "This is a huge obstacle." "How will you overcome it?" "Gentlemen, you've lost." "This isn't your fault." "I'm just too strong." "How else did I become demon king?" "I'm an expert" "on all that you don't know." "He's the best rapper" "among the three worlds in Black Wing Fortress." "Technique plus magic," "added to my perfect aura," "you will lose for sure. It's inevitable." "Surrender and I will let you go." "You are overwhelmed by my demonic demeanor." "Take my advice, go back and show off about it." "Don't be shy." "Show us the level of rapping" "the gods can put out." "See if it matches up to Ji Gong's reputation as savior." "You want her essence? Get past me first," "or go back to" "where you were born." I thought he'd be so good. "Now let me show you" "how Ji Gong's rap flows." "I may be shabby," "but I don't stink," "unlike you, the demon" "who only looks good on the outside." "Seldom does one see a demon like this." "This isn't paradise," "because it's 10000 times more powerful." "All the gods it nurtures are good, kind souls." "Heaven sent me, Ji Gong," "because I'm enough to defeat you." "If I can't even do that," "I'd make the entire heavenly court look bad." "I go out and heal the world," "but I never get drunk." "Listen to my rap," "do I match up to my rep?" "I always want to do good," "just to save people out of this world of suffering." "I've been guiding mankind" "for more than a few years." "I was born" "to take out evil beings like you." "I am the nemesis of all evil," "and the favorite of Buddha himself." "Listen up, Demon," "this is my retaliation." "Return the essence now," "or I won't give you a moment's rest." "I'm the amazing Taming Dragon Arhat." "I have never missed before." "There are no fireworks show, because I do solid work." "What kind of rookie demon are you?" "Now that I've seen you, I know why nobody loves you." "Watch me get past you with ease." "A few rhymes from me and you're shaking in your boots." "You're out of my league." "Don't bank on luck, surrender now," "and I will spare your life." Boss, did they upset you? Do you want some medicine? You traitors! How has your boss treated you? Ji Gong rapped... quite well, but... shouldn't you... save face for your boss? By popular vote, you know who won. The result is clear. Don't be a sore loser. Give Miss Feng Yi's essence to us now. Gentlemen, I said it just now, this is my territory, we play by our rules. I'll give it to you if I want, or not if I don't. I will beat you up if I want to. Boss, we're just playing. There's no need for violence. That's right, we're going to beat him up! Oh, no. It all comes down to blows. Hide on the side. Transformation? What a waste of my breath. Bring it on! That's enough. I've shown you enough courtesy, seeing as this is your territory. Don't forget, I'm the Taming Dragon Arhat! No... Don't burn so quickly. Not so fast... So you're in a hurry. Fine, I'll drag this out until morning. Got a taste of my power yet? Try my Taming Dragon 18 Palms! Where are you going? Master... - What? - Hurry, we're out of time. Miss Feng Yi's essence will dissipate soon. What? Netherworld Demon, come on out, or I'll level this place! Do you really think I won't kill just because I'm a monk? You know nothing! I'm here. Don't go! Let's... negotiate. You want the essence? Simple. You have to exchange it for one thing. Exchange it for one thing? Why didn't you say so? I came prepared. He's big and strong. Feel free to take him. No... I want your essence for her essence. My essence? I knew you wouldn't agree. Forget it. Wait! Master, no... I said I was going to go against all heavenly principles. If we can get back Miss Feng Yi's essence, it'd be worth it. Move aside. Keep your word. Master, I have it! Good job, Shuang Yue! Give it to me. What are you doing? Peng Bird is back. You tricked me? Shuang Yue? What a terrible name. I'm Peng Bird! Peng Bird. It's such a heroic, strong name. Don't you agree? When do the bad guys ever keep their word? We're just telling fairy tales. "You said to me, crying," "that all fairy tales are lies." You sure like to sing. Do you know how hard it was for me these two months? I had to call you Master every day. Do you know how disgusting that was? I almost thought I was a good enough actor to win Best Actor Award! Our Best Actor! Give him some applause. Thank you, everyone... Thank you to all those who support Peng Bird. Thank you. Thank you, Mom, Dad. Right, I almost forget to tell you one more thing. I was actually the one who killed Miss Feng Yi. How else could I have tricked you into coming here? Stay away. I'm sorry... I... did it on purpose. If I hadn't done that, I'd never be able to realize my ambitions. So I must sacrifice you. It'll be quick... Why did you do it? Well, because he had my essence. He wanted your essence in exchange for mine. Anyway, it's trade. Get it? You idiot! That's scary. I'm so scared. What did you do to Feng Yi? What did you do to her? Feng Yi? Right. Over there. Feng Yi... Where did you go? Don't disappear. Come back... Ji Gong has been looking for you for so long. No! She's gone. When time is up, she's gone. I can't help you on that. Usually, by this time, the story is about to end. You... Kill him. Definitely not. Remember, he is the Taming Dragon Arhat. If we kill him, Ksitigarbha will have no mercy on you or I. I can't afford that. How about you use his Taming Dragon... Heaven Palm? Right? Send him back to heaven. Good idea! Dao Ji. Dao Ji. Wake up, Dao Ji. He's awake... Come on, get up. Where is Miss Feng Yi's essence? Did you get it? No. They took my essence too. What about... Shuang Yue? He went with you. He turned back into Peng Bird. It was him who killed Miss Feng Yi, not Vice Commander Huang. I'm sure you must have other ideas. You usually do. You are so powerful. You must have other ideas. Right? No. There is no justice or fairness. Good deeds won't be rewarded. Commander Gao, I'm sorry. I did my best. Dao Ji! Your fan! Throw it away. Feng Yi. Help! - Pretty girl. - Let go of me! Come here. - Let go of me. - Let me have some fun. Who are you? Go away. Stay out of my business. Leave! So he already killed several people and raped multiple women. He's done all sorts of wicked deeds. Should I set him straight or kill him, so he won't harm anyone ever again? Go! "I still remember everything I shared with you" "Even heartbreak is an experience" Master Dao Ji! "When you leave, there's a bit" Master Dao Ji! "Of heartache" "It's inevitable" "Every time I think about you" "My heart aches a little more" "I thought we'd have more time" Master Dao Ji, Miss Feng Yi's funeral ritual is about to end. Will you see her one last time? "How can I make you disappear completely" No. "Don't torture me, time and again" "Until I am about to break" "We can't go back inside from the present world" "Lingering between tomorrow and the past" "Why can't the ending be just closing your eyes" "And when we open them again" "Everything is forgotten" "Why does love feel so sweet?" "The pain of ending intensifies" "When I am with you." Master. "My instincts tell me there is ending" "I just never thought" "the dissolved sugar" Commander Gao. "Will remain in my heart for so long" We shouldn't delay this any longer. "Every time I think about you" "My heart aches a little more" "I thought as time goes on" "You will get further away from me" Up. "How can I make you disappear completely" "Don't torture me, time and again" "Until I am about to break" "We can't go back inside from the present world" "Lingering between tomorrow and the past" "Why can't the ending be just closing your eyes" "And when we open them again" "Everything is forgotten" "Why does love feel so sweet?" "The pain of ending intensifies" "Every stunning thing you ever said" "Struggles by my ears" "You are no longer by my side" "Without your shadow" "I can still hear your voice" "Hearing is getting worse" Feng Yi, rest in peace. I want to grow up to be a good person like Sister Feng Yi. "Don't torture me, time and again" "Until I am about to break" "We can't go back inside from the present world" "Lingering between tomorrow and the past" "Why can't the ending be just closing your eyes" "And when we open them again" "Everything is forgotten" "Why does love feel so sweet?" "Ending it feels like tearing my soul apart" You said... swans protect each other and see their partners as life partners. I love you, not only in this life, but for eternity. If there is a next life, let me take good care of you. Goodbye. Miss Feng Yi did so many good deeds when she was alive. She will reach nirvana soon. Thank you, holy monk. Not yet! Look. I finally understand. This is your plan. I was too impulsive earlier. If I had offended you, please forgive me. Commander Gao, I have good news for you. Miss Feng Yi is now a goddess. She is right in front of you. Where is she? Can I see her? But I can help you hear her. Brother Gao. Feng Yi. There is still so much I want to say to you, so much I want to do with you. Brother Gao. It's all right. The heavens gave me a chance to see you again. That's already a great blessing. Don't blame the heavens. Live a good life, all right? Feng Yi! I promise you I will live a good life! Lei Zhenzi, how nice of you to come to earth to visit me. I got news that you were in trouble, so they sent me to help you. What trouble can I be in? I just lost my essence. Now I feel so light and free. Since you are here, you must have a way to get my essence back. Of course. Let's go. I'm impressed. I can't believe you still dare come here. I don't even have to ask. You must be back to beg me for your essence back. I'm glad you know. It saves so much talking. I may not be able to take you down on my own, but it should work with more of me. Which one is real? Come and find out. Come on. Which one of you is real? He... is real. Don't hit me... Are all these three fake? Yes. The two I got are fake too. Where is the real one then? Where did the real one go? Get out here! - Come out! - Come out! Come out! Peng Bird, you... Peng Bird? Who's Peng Bird? I'm back again. That tasted so familiar. You lied to me? If the good guy gets tricked every time, who will ever be the good guy? It's about time I trick you too, don't you think? Which one of you is real? He is real. Where is the real Peng Bird? Here! I never imagined it'd be so easy to trick you. It just took a few extras Lei Zhenzi found in heaven. It's time to wrap up the story. Let's do it then, so we can get off work early. Done. Why do the bad guys never get to win? It couldn't have been done without your help. Don't mention it. You're always like that. Let's tie up the loose ends. All right... Where's the bird? Never mind him. How else are we going to get the next episode? - True. - Let me buy you dinner. Big Three? Big Four. With Feng Yi gone, there is nothing tying me to this world. I wish to become a monk and spread her kindness everywhere. Becoming a monk and cutting all earthly ties. No wonder Gao Renjie's red string wasn't tied to anyone's. It's karma. Heavenly principles do work among all of us. Your wish is done. It's connected at the back... Good. Hello. Right? It really won't fit me. - Yes. - So? You can thank the old man. That's how he looks. When I have my hair up, Chung says I look like a woman. "This person is acting" "I really don't have..." "I hope to give him a simpler..." "All right? I just want 998" Evil is here. You must come with me. Let's go. Go? Let's go. Then you... If the protagonist gets tricked every time, who would want to be... Not the protagonist, the good guys. Stay away. Bring it on! No fighting... What should we do then? Cut. She kept saying, it's upside down... And then, it's upside down... I was wondering why... She fell here. Stay away... - Are you hurt? All right? - Are you all right?
