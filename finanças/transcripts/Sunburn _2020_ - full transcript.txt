Casey, I made it man, I can't wait to catch up. Hey, this is Casey. Do that thing. Hey, Casey, everything okay? Hey, did you get my last message? Where are you? Hey, this is Casey. Do that thing you. Excuse me. Excuse me. Is it far to Angustias? Angustias. What? Angustias. Great. Hello. Hello. Anyone there? I'm sorry, I don't speak Spanish. It's hot. Is this Angustias? Si. Difficult journey, huh? You look tired. I'm looking for Bar La Granja. Pass the church, on your right. Thanks. My pleasure. Hey, Could I get a glass of water? Water. Uh. No, no, I meant. Gracias. Thanks. Casey? Hey, wait up. Casey? Sorry. Hi. Hey. I'm Lucia. I'm Mike. Can I get you a drink? Sure. Gracias. Thanks. Is something wrong? No. Are you allowed to smoke in here? This is Angustias. Things are different here. What's wrong? My aunt just passed away. I haven't really laughed in a while. Casey didn't wait for you? There's not much he could have done. Have you seen him? No, sorry. Anyways, how come your English is so good? My parents met in Madrid. Moved to England, got married. And then? They stopped loving each other. My bag. Someone's taken my bag! No, no, no, no, no, no, it was right here! Everything I own was in there, my passport, my money, everything! Mike, it's okay. No, you don't understand. I need to find my bag. He must be on patrol. This is so messed up. I'm gonna have to cancel all my cards. Shit! Someone took it by mistake. They'll hand it in. Trust me. Your arm. I'm fine. It looks sore. You can't take any chances with this heat. Come, I wanna show you something. Do you ever miss London? Big cities are full of strangers. Here everyone knows each other. Cares for each other. Everyone plays their part. Hey, you're safe here. So you get to see this, like all the time? Huh, that's great. How old are you? 21. 22 in January. You're sweet. Do you find me attractive, Mike? Sure, it's just, women like you tend to go for guys like Casey. Women like me? Yeah, who are out of my league. So, where are you staying tonight? I have a room. Plus, you could really do with a shower. I'm sure your friend will call in the morning. Yes or no? For real? Wolves. They can make a real mess. I'll get you a towel. Hey, is this your mom? Put it down. I said, put it down. Look, I'm really sorry. Go have a shower. Hey, I didn't mean to-- Go. Down the stairs. What the hell is wrong with you? Hello? Hey, this is for you. For your skin. Thanks. Hey, listen, about earl. Who's are these? A guy left them here. It finished a long time ago. Did you hear that? What? Footsteps. No. There's someone out there. There's no one here. I'm telling you, I heard someone when I was in the shower and again just now. Mike? Are you feeling okay? Did it, did it just get really hot out here? Hey, come on, let's go back inside. What happened? Sunstroke. Your body was shutting down. Do I need to see a doctor? No, you just need to rest. You were jet lagged, dehydrated, it was too much. How did I get here? Angustian women are strong. Now we need to get you healthy again. You're no good to anyone like this. Hey, take it easy. Take it easy. How long have I been asleep? All night and most of the day. I'll be back soon. That song.

I'm really starting to worry. What if he had an accident? Something's not right. I should go look for him. Mike, you're not strong enough yet. I need to do something. The police station will open in a few hours. Then we can fix everything. Okay? What happened to my clothes? They're in the wash. Here, try this. Beetroot, almond and basil wrapped in tortilla. Oh, my God. I'm really starting to like this stuff. That's good. It's so peaceful out here. Yeah, but it's getting hot. The color's coming back to your face. Casey! This is the same bottle I had. You can only buy this in the states. He was here. Casey was here. Casey! Casey! Casey! Mike, this is crazy. Look, you need to help me find him. Mike? Casey! Casey! Look, I think you know what happened to Casey. He bailed. He's probably having a good time with some girl. And you're the last thing on his mind. I still need to make sure he's okay. There are many similar villages around this area, so, maybe your friend was never in Angustias. Since four days have passed, I've just put a search party together. How many people are we talking? At the moment, just me. Is this a joke? We have limited resources, Mr. Oliver. It is best I can do. Have you tried to speak to his parents back in America? There's no signal here. But if you had one, would you have called them? No, because you're not sure he's really missing. Right? Well what if he got caught in the sun? Then he's dead. A body roasts really quickly in this heat. And the smell, the smell is quite something. And then it is a race against time. Either we find him or the animals do. It's time for you to leave. Where are you going with that? Hey, it's the only proof I've got that Casey was even here. Sending it away for analysis. Well what about my bag? Lucia told you about my bag, right? Of course she did. Seems like you're losing everything. I'll call you if I have any news. You'll call me. He'll call me. For the last time, I don't get any fucking reception off this thing. Is it true that you had Sunstroke. How do you know that? This is a very small village. News travels fast. Mr. Oliver, I'm sure I will see you again. Have a nice day. I'm gonna find somewhere else to stay. What, no! Look, you've been great. All of this has been great. I just need time to think. Mike, you are still recovering-- I just wanna find Casey, find my bag, and get the hell outta here. Since you came here, all I've done is try to help. Okay. Do what you want. Lucia, stop. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? It's not you, it's just this, this whole situation. Just be nice to me. What happened? Why are you doing this? Shh. Please, just let me go. Open your mouth. Good, good. I'll check on you later. Please. Lucia. Lucia, please let me go! Lucia! Lucia! Lucia, come back! Somebody help me! That old woman was here. The one from the bar. She said that what you're doing is wrong. That all of this is wrong. She told you to let me go. You need to listen to her. No one, no one else was here. You must have been dreaming. Good. Much better. It's okay, everything's gonna be okay. ♪ Now or never ♪ ♪ We're going away ♪ ♪ Who even knows what we will find ♪ We all make mistakes. It's important we learn from them. How long are you gonna keep here like this? Until it's safe. It was the sunstroke. What was it you called it? It made me run. But that wasn't me. I'm better now. I see things clearly.

Mike, please! Oh, come on. Mike! Casey. Mike. Let me explain. I'll tell you everything. Okay? Everything. It's so quiet here now. 10 years ago, these fields were full of cattle. We were able to live. We were happy. Then they built a new water plant and everything went wrong. The people and the animals got sick. We couldn't drink our own water. My mom was the first to die. I cared for her just like I cared for you. But it wasn't enough. They said that there was an accident, that there was no one to blame. But what happened here wasn't right. What they did to us wasn't right. So this is about revenge? No. It's survival. It's hard getting here. People arrive dehydrated. So I take them home, purify the system, feed them the same food the animals used to eat. Then they're put in the ground, wrapped in salt, then six months later, they're ready. For what? I didn't want this for you, Mike. You meant something to me. You still do. You kidnapped me. Tied me to the bed. You killed my best friend. All relationships have problems. I've done bad things. I can change. It's not too late. We'll leave this place. You were safe with me. Lucia tried really hard to keep you from us and look how you pay her back. They said the new water plant was gonna make all our lives better. Please. Better. Now, we have to look after ourselves. We are good people, Mr. Oliver. I want you to remember that. Please.
