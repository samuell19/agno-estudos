ANARCHY IN (JA)PANTY I was never the hero. As a kid I was never good at sports. In baseball, I was the bench-warmer. There was one time when I was up to bat and already had two strikes. My teammates were giving up already. I closed my eyes and swung the bat randomly. For the first time, I hit the ball into the outfield. I ran the bases. The crowd was finally cheering for me. Then, they all started laughing. What the fuck? I looked down... to see that my dick had been hanging out the whole time. Embarrassed, I ran past home plate and away from the field. It was the first time that I had felt... the absolute best and worst at the same time. Where are you off to? I'm out of here. Oh, okay. See ya. I can't have kids anymore. Because of your fucking cock! Fuck you. Mom? It's me, Mizuki. Yes, I'm good. I'm doing good. I'm too busy working to visit you guys. How are you both doing? Mizuki, is that you? And you are...? It's me, Yoshimura. Ah, you don't remember me... Oh yeah. Yoshimura! Long time no see. We talk about you a lot. Kawano said... You remember Kawano, right? - Who's she again? - She was in the tennis club. She was a very quiet girl. Well, anyway, she said she saw you on a TV show. That's awesome! Are you appearing on any other TV shows soon? I'm acting in a play next. Wow, that's great! Cool! You're so different from the rest of us. Acting was my dream. You were always so talented. That's great. You're special. No, I'm not. Hey, what's Ryuichi Sakamoto like? Have you met him? He's alright, but a lot of people don't like him. Yeah, I can imagine. But, you're really great. Hey, let's go somewhere. What? You have a car, right? Well… yeah. You're beautiful. Oh, Mizuki! I can't wait! What's wrong? Hey, hold on! Leave me alone. Why? Did I come too soon? That was it, right? It was nice. I like you. I love you. You love me, right? I see, you want some time to think, right? Things did happen way too fast. Yes, Yoshimura. I want to think about it alone. Alright. I'll be at that bar again tomorrow! Wait for me. Do you have any napkins? Napkins? Damn. Here you go. I'm on my period. What am I supposed to do with this? Ah, those "napkins"... Let me see… napkins… Looks like we're out. Lots of women must be on their periods now. Double burger, a soda and a coffee. Right. Here you go. Hey, do you wanna sleep with me? What? You wanna screw? - Dummy. - Dummy! Let's eat this at home. Come on! At least clean up your fucking mess! Hey, Tatsutoshi! Come on, let's go! Hurry up! Shut up, you cockroaches! He looks grumpy today. He'll be fine soon. C'mon, let's go! Tatsutoshi, did you count the receipts? - Ah, I'm sorry. - Do it before you leave. Chill out, will ya?! Big shot manager... Oh no! My dick's getting hard! Tatsutoshi, give me a drink! Nakazato, are you ok? You drink too much. It raises my stamina! I think I'll get anal today! You're crazy. Ah, I want to fuck! Anal or not, I just want to fuck! Don't you, Tatsutoshi? Hey, don't run off! You're cheating! - Tatsutoshi! - Wait up, Tatsutoshi! Tatsutoshi! Tatsutoshi! Tatsutoshi! Wait! Welcome! All I think about is women. It's a lie that we can stop it after we get old. Fucking. Pussy. And the dream of doing anal. We played some ping-pong after drinking. I got my ass handed to me. Like I said, I'm bad at sports. Yeah! Shit! Damn it! - Were you peeling the skin off your dick? - Shut the fuck up! What the fuck is that smell? Huh? Welcome. I like her! - Who likes anal? - Me! - Good. - Let's go! Let's go. - That's how you like it? - Mommy, please change my diaper. Mommy, please. I suppose… - Not ready yet? - Aren't you on your period? - Not a problem. - Really? Yep. Get undressed. Fuck this, let's go somewhere else. That's enough. No way! Let's find another brothel. I can't sleep. We just came from one! Ping pong? No. Go by yourself. Hey, let's bet again. I said no! I don't mean I'm not good at ping-pong. So, you'll be fine now. You'll win today. You can get your revenge. He's right. You can't have your funeral at my company if we don't go play! That's fine. I'm sure I can beat you two easily. Let's do it. Then, treat us to a brothel. Shut up! It's your turn, asshole! How about an escort service? My work starts late today. Let's go! Come on, Tatsutoshi. - I don't want to! - Come on! Hey, kid. Play with me. If you win, I'll give you 10 bucks. Come on. Hey. Come on. Come on! Yeah! Shit! Damn! Go for it! Yeah! You can do it! Oops! Shit. Take that! Come on! How am I doing? Good? Hey. Tatsutoshi, your dad called just now. Honey… Dad! I didn't expect this to happen! Why didn't you tell me sooner? What? You're the one that abandoned us! Shut up! We visited your sister in Sendai city. After that, she wanted to see the Meiji Shrine. You know, she is pretty religious. That's why. We took a bullet train to Tokyo. We were in front of the shrine... she pointed at something, then suddenly she collapsed. Had she been doing poorly before that? No. If it were a brain hemorrhage, she would have had a headache. She'd never mentioned anything like that. Really. Are you sleepy? Yeah, I didn't sleep last night. I can't believe you can sleep at a time like this. I think she's in trouble. I don't know if it's the right time to say this... she's been saying that she wants to see a grandchild. You'll be 40 soon. Do something. Sleep well. Do it again. Yoshiki, don't look at him. Hey, stop it! What's your problem? You guys come here every night. I don't like cooking. What about your husband? I don't have a husband. Huh. What? You look like my ex-girlfriend from high school. That's ridiculous. Seriously. Ok, so what happened? Nothing happened. Of course not. Of course not… Whatever. Dummy. Give it here. I have to pee. Yay! Come here! You need paper? No, just come here! What's up? Take off your pants. Here? Drop them. That exhibitionist woman was good for me… Fate… Everyone believes in a love that's meant to be. While it's good, anyway. If you say God exists, make him drink this water. See, God drank a bit more. It just evaporated. That's God's way of drinking. God should be able to drink even all of the oceans at once. That's right. There's no God. Great! Yeah! Oh, yeah! YEAAAAH! YES! Thank you! Yeah! Yeah! Jackass! They're good. Yes, especially that southpaw. No way, I can take him. Then go do it! Alright! That's it for you, buddy! He's getting schooled! Ok, come on! Tatsutoshi, no retries! Aren't you better than him? You gonna treat us to a brothel? Shut up. I know. Such assholes. Yeah! What? Tatsutoshi, where is he? Calm down. He's been checked. He's fine. Where is he? Over there. He's sleeping now. Why did you take him here? Why didn't you call me? Hold on. He had a head injury. Who knows what could've happened. No kidding! Of all things... Did they document anything? Did you sign any papers? Why are you so upset? I wrote down his name and address. I don't know his blood type or anything. That's it? That's it. Did they take his fingerprints? Don't be dumb. Why would they do that at a hospital? Ok… - I gotta take him home! - Wait. He should stay here tonight. Like hell he should! Why are you so angry? This is a limited time free gift! And this one as well! Can you offer one month free? Maybe I'll try another newspaper. Of course! No! Why don't you change my diaper? I brought this all for you! That's why you let me in, right? Change my diaper! He was arrested and the housewife he raped pressed charges. He deserved it. Tatsutoshi. - You jerk! - Don't cry now. We gotta go! Visit us sometime! See ya! Bye, bye! Take care! Nakazato and Haruka from the brothel, both alcoholics, got married. They bought a hostel in the countryside using her savings. He was lucky to have her. I held on to his crappy scooter. My mother died a month after returning home from the hospital. I couldn't suddenly show up with a lady and a kid, so I went to the funeral alone. My father said that he felt better now because she was too noisy… But I know he was lonely. I thought that he should have died first. It would've been easier to deal with an aging mother. Ouch! MISSING INFANT. VICTIM OF KIDNAPPING? Tatsutoshi! Oh, a cockroach. Tatsutoshi! Tatsutoshi? He said he'd be back today. There's his jacket. Where'd he go? Why…? It's none of your business! Dad... Mom... I'm fine. Don't worry. Please do as the man says. Come to the following location. The woods near the entrance to the ski slopes next to highway 141. Hey. Show it off to everyone. I'm coming! No, not yet! I can't help it. No. Show your face. Mari... Mari, Mari! Mr. Fukuda, please calm down. No! No more! Don't watch this! It's an important clue. Please... Honey... I... I'm sorry. We are not watching a porno movie. Hello? - You got the money? - Yes! Mari... is she ok? Yeah. Dad, help me! Mari. Just follow my demands. Let's fuck! You're weird, aren't you? Don't get so down about closing your hostel. Damn it! I'm not! It's that bitch, Haruka. I'll never forgive her! Love lasts as long as there's money. The unemployment rate is 4.4%. I wish it was still the bubble era. The government really fucked up here! - See you. - Bye. Now you're the owner. I envy you! Hey... Isn't that Yoshiki? Wow, he's all grown up! His dick, too. Damn, Yoshiki. Look at him go at it! That girl's cute. Shit! I'm getting a boner! Tatsutoshi! What did you teach him? Single fathers can't do it all. Well, I can! Stop it! Do you hear me? Quit peeping! How can you do that here? You've got a hot chick, Yoshiki. Get your ass out of there! Don't get carried away. - Who made you my father? - What? It would've been better if I'd died with mom, when she crashed the car. Yeah, go and die! I kidnapped her. What? I figured everything out. I went to the place where mom died… And met the people whose son got kidnapped a while back. She was adopted… to fill the void of the kidnapped child. Hey, what's he talking about? You knew everything. You guys are as cruel as those parents. That's why I kidnapped her. You're lying. I'm not. How much is the ransom? That doesn't concern you. It should be a lot. I want some money, too! Me, too! What are you guys thinking? I need money. Me, too! And I've got a criminal record… Shit! Hurry up! The day Mizuki died, I met Yoshiki's father. I pretended to be a detective. After Yoshiki was kidnapped, they adopted a girl. I raised Yoshiki concealing from him Mizuki's crime. - Stop it! - What the fuck! Give it back! After growing up, Yoshiki became a defiant boy. Like me, he found the newspaper clipping and figured it all out. He hasn't shown up? No, not yet. Is the money ready? Stop there. Give us the money and I'll give you your daughter. Y... yes! Throw it to me. What? Mari! What's going on? Hey, Freeze! - It's mine! - Wait! Don't move! Freeze! Stop there! Ouch! Come here! Hey, Tatsutoshi! Tatsutoshi! Where are you going? Tatsutoshi! Don't leave us! Ouch. For some reason I'm really wet. The wind feels good. Why did you kill her?! Why have you been deceiving me? Do you think you're God? You played with my life! Can you imagine how I feel? My life was a lie! You guys made it that way! I was going to tell you someday! I was! I'm over Mom's kidnapping me. The problem is what you've done to me. Why didn't you give me back my life when you found out what she did!? Run! Run away! Run, like when you hit a home run in your childhood. I loved that story. I was your child. That was my father's special story! I was happy with you. You protected us. What are you talking about? You only think about yourself, don't you!? A few seconds after my heart stopped, I had a dream. I'm not sure if it was a dream or if it was real. Or if it was in the past or future. But I understood that it was happening right here, right now... and then I died. Oh... My period's started. What a big tree!
