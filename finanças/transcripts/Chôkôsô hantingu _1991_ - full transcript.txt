They're inside. They kidnapped the women. You know what they're doing. - Let's attack. - What about the women? - Try not to kill them. - But... But, if there's no other way... kill them. This isn't a mercy mission. Written by Junki Takegami Assistant Director: Shoyou Gsogi Based on the novel by Baku Yumemakura Music by Goro Awaji Cinematography by Shinichi Ooka Hijikata! Daiba! What's the matter with him? Why didn't he shoot? I couldn't do it. I couldn't shoot... and now it's too late! Special Effects by Shinichi Ooka Directed by Mitsunori Hattori What are you going to do? They appeared for the first time in the 1980s. In the beginning, there weren't many of them. They looked like humans in every way... but they weren't. A pulsing appendage on the back was a certain non-human sign. This species has the potential to destroy the human race. They can generate a destructive impulse, which destroys the brain. They plan to propagate their race by random sexual contact. They are called 'Abnormal Species Humanoids', or more simply 'ASH'. In our country, we developed a secret organistion to kill the ASH: Japanese Society For Environmental Protection And those people who hunt the ASH are known as 'psychosists'. By the beginning of the 1990's, due to the extensive work of the psychosists, the threat of the ASH was all but over. And the people of the world never knew about the ASH threat. HUNTING ASH aka 'Skyscraper Hunting' Doctor - you wanted to see me? Four ASH are active in Tokyo now. In Tokyo? We are faced with two possibilities. Could it have to do with the Genetic Research Clinic? If they really put their technology and brains into it... it wouldn't take them long to create ASH clones. If that's the goal, then the staff must have been infiltrated by the ASH. What's the other possibility? Lately, I've been hearing rumours about psychosists... No way! - Only two tonight? - No, three. Bastard! We don't need any other help. I won't let you go! Identical - you look just like a human. Who are you? Yeah, you know me... You guys call me 'Hunter'. A fucking hunter! What are you going to do? Capture me? I never capture - I don't believe in reformation. I just kill. No, wait, I... I'll kill you before you can use your powers. You are my enemy... It's time for you to be killed. Stop! She's just a normal ASH. You didn't have to torture her. Does it make you feel powerful? Do you have to brutalise them? Since when did you become the chief? I'm just... doing my job. 17th Genetics Research Group Annual International Meeting Aya was captured. Maybe it won't work out after all. Wait a minute - the plan is going well. I feel apprehensive watching you conduct this affair. Wouldn't it go faster if you merely kidnapped a male ASH? That would be the last resort. I know we'll succeed. We can't allow ourselves to continue being killed off! Mother... mother... No! Seems like you come here often! You can't take your eyes off her. Whenever I hate them intensely, I come here. I heard both your parents were killed by the ASH. The ASH you found last night survived. It's important to retrieve them alive for our research. Go easy! The reason I took the job in the first place was to kill them. I went through 'Resistance Training' for that purpose. There's no way I can be a nice boy for you! If you don't like that... then fire me. But, even if you fire me, I'll still continue killing them. We've captured one ASH out of four. Three more to go. They must be connected with one of two groups: either the Genetics Group or the Psychosists. Even if the ASH infiltrated our organisation, the psychosists would never betray the company. This is a file showing Inoue's activities for a week. His behaviour is erratic, to say the least. Really? The best soldiers are the most predictable ones. Do you want me to call Okamoto? I got you. What was that? Do you know the principle of time versus space? Millions of years ago, the earth was created by the Big Bang. Since then, time has continued to expand faster than space. We figure an escalation of 23 seconds over 200 million years. This imbalance has created an uneven number of molecules... Our atmosphere is an unexplored territory, if you can understand it. You can even fly. Please! My brain is different from yours; it's very simplistic! I know you can understand this. Why did you want to talk in private? I think I'm going to contact the ASH myself. Without approval from Kondo? Yeah, that's what they requested. But why? What do they want? I know you don't understand, but they have valuable information. I feel it's a trap. I know one thing for sure: they are our enemy. Nothing more. Don't you think it's strange how the ASH just appeared in the 80s? Before that, they were hiding. But where? It's being investigated. That's not the only thing - the power they have. What is it? It's an advanced form of telekinesis. Don't you think it's similar to a human's ability? What the fuck are you trying to say? I know for sure... they weren't created by God. They were created by... humans. That's impossible. That's why I want to talk to them. I must know! Oh, by the way - Sanae says she wants to see you. We saw each other a lot when I was in training. - She's already in college. - She's that grown-up? - She's starting to look sexy. - Could that tomboy be sexy? If something happens to me... please look after Sanae. I don't know if I can trust the ASH... but I know I can trust you. Somebody is watching me. Somebody other than Inoue... a psychosist is watching me. Why don't they show up? Where are they? What's going on? Are they hiding... hiding in the open? They could be anyone... how would I know? If the ASH are planning an attack... they have the advantage. I wonder if this is a trick, like Hijikata said?! I can't believe this happened. He knew how to protect himself. Daiba... what do you think? Their power is becoming more advanced. While he was running away, his defences were down, and... they attacked his brain. Similar to my situation... but you saved my brain... and lost my body. Watch yourselves very carefully, or you'll end up like this. If something happens to me... please look after Sanae. they weren't created by God. They were created by humans. I'll do it! Hijikata! I'm not even close to Inoue's breakthrough. You must be careful. You don't want a machine body. What is your purpose for being here? How much do you creatures know? I'm getting used to living inside my robot body... but sometimes I use drugs to remember my human existence. If I don't do that, I can't remember who I am. Daiba... I'm sorry. Sometimes I'm just melancholy. Why were you trying to contact a psychosist? Tell me! Tell me! Should I tell Sanae about her brother? Just don't show her the body. You're right. Talk to her. If I talked to her, it wouldn't do any good. My 'body' would repulse her. She'll be comfortable with you. Right. We've surrounded the building. The ASH broke loose. Oh shit! The reason we live... I'll tell you why... we are... here in Tokyo... The real... purpose is... the Genetics Research Clinic... is not the enemy. Be careful of your own people. We came here... to form a pact... with the psychosists. Shit! Are you proud of yourself? Most people at the Institute don't have relatives. That's why our bonding is very strong. We don't want you to worry about anything. Just continue your college work. Your brother was really against you joining the organisation. He wanted you to be a normal girl... a normal college graduate. Tell me the truth... my brother - what was his job? What do you guys do? What are you trained for at the Resistance Training Camp? I can't tell you about it. Someday, maybe I will be able to... I was told my brother died in an accident... but they wouldn't let me see his body. Why wasn't I able to see it? Was he involved in something shameful? Was he a bad person? - No! - You are all liars! No. Don't lose faith in your brother. Hijikata... Why... did my brother die? Now you're too upset. We'll talk when you've calmed down. Hijikata! The people who killed Inoue weren't ASH. My name is Himika... I'm an ASH. Come out! Wait. I just want to talk to you. Won't you talk? Yes! Don't we have the right to live in this society too? Yes. How rude that man is! The ASH are hiding in this beautiful city. We can't let anyone know about this. I can't even tell Sanae about the threat from the ASH. Who is it? Hijikata, it's me. Sanae! I'm sorry about today. I lost my head. That's only natural, given the circumstances. I thought I'd give you this. - What is it? - It's my brother's diary... he told me to give it to you, if something happened to him. Your brother said that? Hijikata, do you think this might be of use to you? Of course. Thank you. I'm so glad. I wanted to help you somehow. It's late... I'll take you home. No. I don't want to go back to that dark apartment! There are too many bad memories. Just for tonight, let me stay here. Sanae! I'm not out of control. OK. You can stay here. Did you have a nightmare? You were screaming. I always have the same dream. A nightmare? About my childhood. When I lost my mother... It's just like reality. And when I have that dream... my blood gets hot. I'm surrounded by hate. And that hatred controls me... scares me. My brother was exactly like that. He never gave me the details, but it had to do with a dream. A dream about our parents. And when he woke up... he would have this terrible face - he didn't even look the same. A similar dream? Excuse me... The diary Inoue left me described the dream with clarity. Surprisingly, his dream was the same as mine. Maybe this isn't so unusual, since we both lost our parents to the ASH. But there was another thing in the diary... I found Himika's name in there. My name is Himika. I'm an ASH. Thank you for waiting. Excuse me. - Here. - Himika... It's somebody's name. Those are ancient characters meaning... 'fire', 'visual' and 'scent'. That's an unusual name. Have you ever heard it before? No. Who is it? Oh... never mind. Hijikata, where are you going? I'm sorry. I need to do something. That's okay. I'll be waiting here. I'll be home late. If you want, you can stay here again. Okay. That female ASH was probably the one who contacted Inoue... the one he talked about that day. Welcome. Are you looking for anybody in particular? I'm looking for a girl called Himika. Sure, but she's not working tonight. Do you know how to get in touch with her? We're trying to find her too - she's very popular! Quite a city view... What do they want from us? Seems like this city contains a lot of people who don't value life... You delinquents are making a big mistake. You'd better leave. I usually don't hurt humans, but I'm not opposed to it. These people are not humans! Who is controlling you? He's gone! Coming! Hijikata? My name is Himika. I was a friend of your brother's. You are lucky women! You will help continue the ultimate species. You didn't even hear me enter the room. Someday you'll be surprised by one of your enemies. You are too boring. You should quit dealing with psychosists. I've already asked Rai to continue our plans. You're depending on that young man?! He's the only person I can trust. I see... who's that girl? She's quite beautiful, even though she's only a human. She's Inoue's sister. She will help me contact the psychosists. Don't worry - I'm not going to hurt you. Who are you? Let's see... where should I begin? I was fighting with your brother. Your brother and the others are trying to kill us... and that's why we fight them... to save ourselves. No species wants to die. No way! My brother would never do anything like that! I know you can't believe it when somebody says this, but... first let me tell you about us. We are not humans. We have a different molecular structure. We are a different species. A different species? The humans call us the 'ASH'... you saw that thing on my back? Every ASH has one. Your brother had one... and so did you. We were trained to fight the ASH. During the training, Sanae was the one who gave us strength. We all hoped she'd have a happy life. Hijikata? You're... the woman from the cemetery. Did you take Sanae? I won't hurt her; she's safe. Are you sure? Yeah. I had to do it, in order to talk with you. All I want to do is talk to you. I'm sick of this power game between species. Okay, where shall we meet? I'll go anywhere. There's one condition. You must come alone. The Yikkuu Park at 4. Hijikata is attempting to contact the ASH. He's gotten too involved in this. He's dangerous. Do you want me to stop him? That's not necessary. Let him lead us to them first. What should I do if Hijikata challenges me? Do whatever you need to do. Sanae! Don't come any closer. Listen from there. My name is Himika. I'm borrowing Sanae to talk to you. I swear I won't hurt her. I understand. What do you want to talk about? Do you know the danger you're in? I want to tell you the truth. It's time you knew. We are not a species created by nature. We are the result of experiments by the Genetics Research Clinic, the product of a planned future. What are you saying? We are the result of experiments between the USA and Japan. We are the logical evolution of the human species. Created by humans? There aren't only three ASH left... - What? - You were created, too. You are the result of a union between a human and an ASH. You were created to fight with us. Don't try to lie to me! My mother was killed by the ASH. How old were you? What are your memories of that? Do you remember other things from before or after that? My memory... my memory... You all have the same dream. The same memory. That memory feeds your hatred of the ASH. The memory is the easiest thing to create. Listen: you can install any kind of memory in someone. That's a lie! You're a liar! Liar! I don't believe you! Hijikata! Hijikata! You're in danger! Sanae! Somebody is attacking you! Sanae! Sanae! Are you alright? Don't worry about them. I'll take care of it! Haga! I'll take care of them... - you and Rai can continue with the plan. - But... Somebody has to continue our fight. This can't die with us. It's them - leave! Humans! You weren't our enemy. We didn't want this war. You are killing off a species! Everything we planned has gone down the toilet. Don't give up yet. Rai... Tonight there's a meeting of the research scientists on the 49th floor. Are you talking about the Genetics Researchers? We need to make sure the psychosist Hijikata is there. Rai... Don't worry. Hijikata? Is that the way you deal with problems? It was an accident. I know it's hard for you to believe me. Even though everything you said might be true, I can't forgive you... I will kill you! If that's what you want to do... then do it. But remember: there's no difference between... killing us and killing yourselves. ...and what a view this is from the 49th floor... Hijikata! The 49th floor? Someone said that in the background. Which buildings in Tokyo have a 49th floor? Daiba! Excuse me for entering from the balcony... The Plaza Building is the most likely. That's where the Genetics Research meeting is being held. This information comes from the manager's security department. Now I understand the plan! We are the last of the psychosists. Maybe that was the intention of the ASH all along... Are you going to crash the party? It's probably dangerous... since there are only two of us. I want to kill this enemy... by myself. I'll watch you from the stands. - A whiskey on the rocks. - Of course. The battle has already begun. They know my face, but I don't know them. Thank you for waiting. First I must determine who is ASH... There are 25 guests, plus two waiters, one bartender... and three bunnygirls - 31 people are at this party. I'm sure the ASH are here... I feel their power. Why haven't they approached me? They know I'm here. If they don't attack me... I must attack them! Are you okay? - My glass! Did you see? - Yes... Don't worry about this, ma'am. Enjoy yourself. Could I have another one? Certainly, right away. Now... will they make a move? What is this? It's like magic! Nobody can get out. But the panic makes them easier targets. - Hello? Hello? - Calling for help? - The line's dead. You are an ASH. They know the secret of time and space! Rai... don't kill him. But... I want to be the one who kills him. Don't get cocky! I'm in control of this... I could kill this one without any problems. Why did you kill him? Was that your boyfriend? You killed my girlfriend! - No... We didn't kill her. - What? The people who appeared in the park - they killed her. You mean Okamoto? Sanae was trying to save you from his attack. It happened suddenly - I was also helpless. Rai! - Did you make that happen? - No. I'm going to die soon... I've been waiting for this. What? Maybe you will believe me now... since I'm near death. Can't you quit your propaganda? The things I told you at the park were the truth. I don't believe you... Test it for yourself. The computer in your office holds information... about the ASH killings. In Step 5 of that file, you'll find a complete description... dealing with your extermination, after your work is finished with the ASH. It can't be true! If we could've fought together, we would've made a good team. Do you believe what that ASH said? We should check it out. - Daiba... - Yes? Daiba, you told me you used a drug to remember being human... Yes. Do you think I could erase my bad memory with the drug? The memory is the easiest thing to alter in a brain. Doctor! Hijikata and Daiba have returned. This is the drug... do exactly what I said. I'm going to check the computer. It might be dangerous for you to go by yourself. I'm fine. I'm closer to being a computer than a human now. I can get in easily and access the information. - But... - Don't worry. by the time you regain your composure, everything will be OK. That dream I always have... I wonder if it was all just a fraud? Daiba! Daiba! Hijikata! Daiba! What am I supposed to do? Daiba! My brain circuit is fried... I'm going to die soon. Don't worry about me. Look at the monitor... The truth is on the screen. The ASH were developed by the governments of the USA and Japan. They were created as a temporary experiment for the future. Traditional human beings are not equipped to handle the future. The ASH were created to continue the survival of the planet. Step two: the ASH and humans spawn offspring. These creatures were fed a universal memory. Step three: these people are sent to... a special training camp, where they learn survival. Step four: these people are taught to kill all ASH. Step five: Eliminate all psychosists after the completion of step four. Even though psychosists have been through mind-altering training... they must be considered a dangerous species. There is much risk in this final step. So, it's true - I have ASH genes! Okamoto... So what? What good is the truth going to do you? You knew about this from the beginning? Of course I did. Why? Why didn't you tell us? Tell you? Why would I tell you? I'm also one of you... but I want to live! We're better than the ASH! Even if you'd formed a pact with the ASH, you couldn't have survived. I have to kiss the asses of the humans to keep on living! You bastard! Did you kill Sanae? Yes... And her brother Inoue. I killed them both! I'll do anything to convince the humans that I'm an obedient little dog. God damn bastard! You knew everything! What's wrong with you? Your power is almost gone. Did you use that drug? Time to die. You'll be sorry now! You're going to die for your sins! I'm... dying... now... Daiba! Daiba... I feel sorry for you, Hijikata... if you hadn't stuck your nose into all of this... you could be working in a comfortable job in the USA. Hijikata, you are... the last official descendant of the ASH programme. Maybe you still think you can fight us... but it's impossible. You can't kill all the guards. And besides... this tank has a protective shield. You were our greatest psychosists! Don't think this is over! The battle begins now! My new mission: kill all humans!
