[CHATTERING] [MAN ON P.A.] Happy holidays, everyone, from all of us to all of you… at Cedar Heights Shop and Save. [CLATTERS] Mom. Oh, Alex. What are you doing here? Let's go. [MAN] Sir? Robert? Mike wants to speak with you. Oh. Okay. [PEN CLACKING] So, would you say that you have a lot of stocking experience? [SIGHS] I don't know. I guess. I help my grandma put her groceries away every week. - Grandma's groceries. How old is your grandma? - Uh, 82 or 83. - I'm not sure at this point. - Eighty-two? [SIGHS] I don't know. Don't touch those. [SIGHS] Look, I'm just gonna be straight with you. Do you think you're Cedar Heights Shop and Save material? I mean, do you wanna become a part of this family? - I don't know. I guess I do. - You guess you do? Yeah. You guess? Okay. Well, look… - Peter? - Yeah. Peter. I'm just gonna be honest with you. I'm not sure you want this bad enough. In fact, I know you don't want this bad enough. Because I've got guys lined up around the block. Not today… Okay. Well, thanks for your time. Well… No, no. Okay. - Mike. - Hey, Robert. Um, okay, Peter, look, how about this? How about we give it a month, and then we'll see where we're at. - Okay? All right. - Okay. Thanks. - Can I have one of these? - No, you leave that there. - Yeah. Right up the stairs. - Thanks. Robert. How's work going today? - Uh, fine. - Yeah? Yeah, they said you needed to talk with me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Have a seat. Have a seat. Ah, busy day. Busy day here at Shop and Save. We got a lot of… [TAPPING BUTTONS] [TAPPING CONTINUES] Fix that later. Whatever. Uh, so, Robert, how's the whole everything? Fine. - Yours? - Great. In fact, it's great that you asked, because… I have something you need to see. Now, I think I found something that could really help us all out. I don't wanna hype it up too much. I'm just gonna cut to the chase here. Okay? Okay. I truly think that this… could change the way we celebrate the holiday season. Are you ready? Are you ready, sir? - Uh, yeah. - Yeah? Okay. These are… Christmas recipe books, stuffed full of holiday-themed dinners and desserts… Everything from St. Nick Stew to my personal favorite, Christmas tree-shaped cookies… all delicious. I've made many of them myself. Really? Y-You m-made them yourself? No. It's… It's part of the pitch. Oh. Look, Robert, I'm not trying to sell you this thing. I want us to go into business together, you and me. - I don't understand. - Okay. Look, all I have to do is get a team of people working under me, and then they get a team of people working under them, and then we all start profiting off of each other. See, the more people we get involved, the more money we make. There's no chance we can fail if we never give up. Well, yeah, that makes sense to me. Yes. Yes. Okay. So, what do you think? Should we get everyone up in the store selling these things? Huh? Granted, it might be kind of weird… to have all of the employees of this place all of a sudden be millionaires. - Right? - I'll… I'll think about it, yeah. Hey, do you want, uh, one of these? Take it home? Give it to someone you care about? Maybe another time. - Uh-huh. All right. - Well, good-bye for now. Okay. Hey, do you want a ride home today or anything? Uh, no. I feel like walking. Yeah. - All right. - Bye. [CLOCK TICKING] - Hi. - [GASPS] - I'm sorry for… for coming in like this, but… - I don't know who you are. - I-I'm sorry. - Get out. - I'm sorry for coming in like this. - Take what you want. - Get out of my house. - My daughter and I are moving in… - across the street, and… - Get out of here. I didn't invite you here. Leave now, please. The door was open, and I-I… I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. Hurt? I was just seeing that you're okay. - That I was okay? - Your car is crashed into the garage. Yeah.

You're her ex-husband, aren't you? Excuse me? You're a worthless human being. What are you talking about? You left her. You hurt her. - Mary? - Don't you mention her name. Look, I don't know what was just going on, but I'm gonna find out. - Robert, nothing happened. - People like you do not deserve people like her! - You stop it right now… - Shut your mouth! [BEEPS] [ELECTRONIC VOICE] New messages. Mary, this is Dr. Patrick. I got your message. No need to worry. I talked to the pharmacy and… [DOOR OPENS] Robert? - Hey. - Hey. How's it going? I think it's okay. She's taking care of it. Good. - How you doing? - [LAUGHS] Good. You having fun? Robert, put your coat on. - I think I just made a mistake. - Why? What's wrong? - What? I'm sorry. Did I ruin the party? - What are you talking about? - I yelled at your husband. - You what? Well, he was making… putting moves on you, and I… I didn't know whether that was right or not and… Are you still in love with him? Robert, what? Buck is not my husband. And he certainly wasn't putting moves on me. No, but in the room upstairs… In the room upstairs he was giving me this to give to you. - He gave me this? - Yes. Oh. Oh, my God. I… - Should I open it? - No, no, no. Let's save it for Christmas, huh? - Maybe I should go in and apologize. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You know what? I think it was a mistake to come here in the first place. Let's just go. I want to be alone with you. Wait.
