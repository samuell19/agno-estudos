MAN: [SPEAKS SPANISH] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] MEN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] MEN: [LAUGHING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [BELL DINGING] MAN: [SPEAKS SPANISH] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [DISTANT DOG BARKING] MAN: [SPEAKS SPANISH] [SPEAKS SPANISH] [SPEAKS SPANISH] You speak American? Um, could I have a coffee? Coffee? [SPEAKS SPANISH] EUGENE: You want it black or with cream? With cream. [SPEAKS SPANISH] MARGO: Yeah, leche. Leche. Are you American? That's right. You know this town? Sure. Not much to know. Is, uh, is this the only bus depot? Um-hmm. Somebody supposed to meet you here? Yeah. You got an address? If you have an address, you can walk over instead of sitting around. It won't be far. Well, uh, he lives outside town. Between here and, uh, Mya, something. -Mya-Tomos. -Yeah. Yeah. Well, you're gonna have to wait. Must have his own transport, else he would've rode the bus in. He'll be here. Uh-hmm. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] You're a spunky little thing. Those little guys are called missolitos, supposed to be the sweetest singing birds in Mexico. [SPEAKING SPANISH] He's offering to blind it for you without charge. And throw in a free cage. Blind it? What do you mean, blind it? Yeah. Well, it never did seem like a lot of encouragement to me. But they think that it makes them sing better. How does-- how do they blind it? Well, they heat up a... kind of needle thing. -Oh, Jesus. -EUGENE: Oh, no, no. No, they don't stick it in its eye. They just hold it close enough to, uh... -To fry it. -EUGENE: Cloud it. That makes all the difference, right? [SPEAKS SPANISH] [SPEAKS SPANISH] [SPEAKS SPANISH] [SPEAKS SPANISH] [SPEAKS SPANISH] [SPEAKS SPANISH] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Your friend hasn't showed up. Maybe he got the wrong day. He booked the ticket. Uh-huh. What's his name? Techemacker. Delbert Techemacker. He's my father. The thing is, I wouldn't know him if he came up and bit me on the knee. Might be a hungry dwarf. You say--you say he lives out by Mya-Tomos? Yeah. Something like that. Hmm. I'm going out that way. If you'd like, you can ride around with me and I'll ask about him, can't be too many Delbert Techemackers up in those hills. No hassles. That's the truth. My name's Wilson. Eugene Wilson. I'm Margo. You never finished telling me about your father. I never started. [LAUGHS] I know. I'm kinda pushy. I don't mean to be. Just wanna hear the story, I guess. I don't remember him too well. I was about, uh, six or seven, I guess, when he left. Every so often he used to send my mother money. Nothin' regular, ya know? Nothin' you could count on. I mean, months would go by, there'd be nothing. And then all of a sudden just...plop. There'd be a few bucks. He'd send like 17 bucks... or 11. Once he sent four bucks. Hmm. Weird. Don't you think that's weird? I mean, to send 10 or 20. But... eleven bucks. Weird. You start thinking in smaller numbers when you live down here awhile. Well, about four or five years ago, the money just dried up. Then my mother died. And I was--I guess two or three weeks ago, I went through Zapford, that's where my mother used to live. And I kept her P.O. Box. And there was this letter in it from him. And the thing was that the letter was to me, not to my mother. And it was from him. And it had a-- had a bus ticket down here and the letter. Said he had something to give me. Substantial is what he called it. Like a legacy, you know? Hey [CHUCKLES] I didn't kid myself. I mean, a guy who sends 11 bucks, he ain't gonna be, uh, but... who knows, you know? I didn't have anything better to do, so why not? ♪ South of the border, down Mexico way♪ Is that what you wanted to hear? The best story I've run across in years. MARGO: Well, where are we going? EUGENE: This is the road to San Juan Delescolorus. I show a movie there tonight. MARGO: Out of this truck? Yeah. Got a little generator, runs a projector. Isn't too noisy. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] It won't be five minutes. Got to get permission from the priest . You got to get permission from a priest before you can show a movie? It's just routine. He always says yes. PRIEST: I see you have for us another tale of illicit passion, Eugenio. Well, you know how the poster's always a lot worse than anything you ever see. -Yeah. -Remember the film about the nun? Ah, si, si, The Temptations of Maria. Well, the posters looked terrible. But all that happened was she went skiing. It ain't me, kid. It ain't me. I sometimes think that putting the pleasure between a woman's legs was clever, but not wise. But then he gave us the sacrament of marriage to correct that. Sounds like he's experimenting. Would you like to be an experiment of God? Depends on how I'd turn out. Hey, Eugenio, you have to remember that God loves each and every one of us, as though there were but one of us to love. No matter how we turn out. I'm gonna have some questions about that when I come back. Well, don't forget I'm not God. [SPEAKING SPANISH] How's that? Ah, you see? You have to improve your Spanish and your soul at the same time, huh? Hmm. EUGENE: Priest says there's a gringo, has a place on the other side of the valley. Guess it's got to be him. MARGO: Did he say it was a big place? EUGENE: He's never been over there. MARGO: Are you sure this is the way? EUGENE: Well, this is the way. But I'm not sure if this is the place. MARGO: Think this is it? EUGENE: Well, it's the only place I see. [BIRDS CHIRPING] MARGO: He said in his letter he had a modest estate. I was thinking maybe gouchos, and cattle, and a hacienda. Well, that's the end of that little dream. Aren't you going in? You've come all this way. Yeah. I'm going in. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] MARGO: Is anybody home? [FLOOR CREAKS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] DELBERT: Evangelina? Evangelina? It's Margo. Are you... are you Delbert Teschemacker? Margi? You made it. [CHIMES] What day is it? How come you got your foot in a birdcage? Most dumb thing in the world. Hit a tree with a blunt axe. Bounced off and caught me between the toes. [FLOOR CREAKS] EUGENE: Anybody home? Margo? MARGO: Yeah, we're in here. Come on in. [CHIMES] Childhood friends? Uh, this is Eugene Wilson. He works in town. He gave me a ride out here. Oh. Many thanks, Mr. Wilson, been expecting my little Margi for some time now, told my Evangelina to keep an eye out for her. Maybe I told her in American. You know, sometimes when I think on Margi, I think American. What'd you do to your foot? Oh, this dumb thing in the world. He hit his foot with an axe. He should see a doctor. DELBERT: I don't trust doctors. Not after what they did to a friend of mine. You don't call yourself Margi anymore. Margo. I hate Margi. Well, I'll try to keep it from slippin' out. Now that Margo is here, things are gonna be just fine. Well... you know, I think this is just great. Thank you. You take care of that foot now. I got to get my case. [GROANS] Now you behave yourself. Or I'll put you back in your cage. You hear me? Tell you what. I'm gonna be back in three days. If you want, I'll give you a lift. Chances are, you're gonna be settled in, rolling tortillas by then. Don't bet on it. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] DELBERT: Well, here's to us and our trip. Where are we going? I'm gonna take you back to the bank. Introduce you to my manager. And fix it so that all that money I got there is rightfully yours. You mean you never took it out? Never touched a cent. We'll have a fine trip with that money. Might be my last, so I need to make it dandy. We'll go someplace nice. Where would you like to go? Las Vegas. Never been there. All right. Las Vegas it is. And Frisco. We'll go to Frisco. How come you never took the money out? Money's funny stuff, Margo. Money you can't touch till you touch it right. Like a dream, you're being here. I hope this ain't a dream that don't wake up. [CHEERFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] MARGO: Hey, what are you doing? Shouldn't you be resting that foot? Been in its cage all night. Needs some freedom. What are you doing? Collecting a nice pan of eggs for your breakfast. You keep your eggs out here? That's where she lays them. This is kind of a lot, don't you think? Less some snake would take them. You got snakes around here? Oh, snakes is nighttime beings. [CHUCKLES] I admire a chicken sittin' out there in the dark. Being a bird's tough enough. But when you can't fly... well, that don't seem like any fun at all. [CHUCKLES] [GROANS] You'd have to be pretty damn spunky to be a chicken. Brave as a chicken? Is that what you're telling me? [CHUCKLES] Where is this bank of yours? Mexico. Up north from Roswell. How long you had the account? Well, now let me see-- [GROANS] I guess... I must've been about nineteen when... Tevis and Scobbie, and me were partners. Just wild kids we were. It must've been all of forty-five years. Well, you must've earned a pile of interest on your money in forty-five years. Your money, Margo. I saved it for you. You see, darling, I always expected to come back and get you. But your mother had a, uh, she was mean-hearted. She had plenty to be mean-hearted about after you left us. When I left, I wanted to take you with me. She just laughed at me-- [GROANS] Oh, Jesus! What the hell is that goop she's putting on your foot? I stayed around till you were-- till you were about seven. And I want you to know, Margo, that the best times in my life were spent with you. And one morning I just upped and blew down the road like an old newspaper. You got to see a doctor. DELBERT: No doctors. Not after what they did to Scobbie. There were three of them. And not one of them would help him. The last one washed his hands over and over again till Scobbie died. Tevish would've killed 'em then and there! Only I begged him. Daddy, are you all right? I dreamed about Scobbie last night. MARGO: Who the hell is this Scobbie you keep talking about? I was robbing a bank in Del Rio, Texas. First bank we ever robbed. First and the last. You robbed a bank? When? Oh, long before you were born. Bad times were plentiful. And Tevis said that, "We might as well be pirates. Dry land pirates." Brave as a chicken, I was. Tevis said I'd do just fine. What happened? Scobbie died. Tevis got thirty-four years. I got twelve on account of being young and doing nothing but driving. Ain't nothing to be proud of. Except it's all buried now. All except me. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [CHIMES] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Hey, some of the little mistletoes over there. It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. Margi is not gonna hurt you. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Oh, you bastard! Did she catch many with that stuff? Oh, hundreds. Evangelina makes the best gum of anybody around here. Bolivian secret. You sure that's not what she's putting on your foot? I got to get you a new room. Hmm? Get you a bigger cage. [SPEAKING SPANISH]. A bird is never free of the chains of the sky. That's what they say. Yeah. You know, that's exactly the kind of bullshit I expect from people who blind birds to make them sing better. Things have been going hard for you, Margo? You give some shit, don't you? Well, no. Probably a day's never passed that somewhere, someplace I haven't thought about you. You're a goddamn liar! You took off when it suited you. And sometimes when you were loaded or you saw some kid looking cute, you thought, "Oh, I wonder where my little Margi is?" But you sure as hell weren't wondering where this Margo was every day. And you got me down here with some load of crap about how you had something to give me. 'Cause you knew I'd never come to this dump unless you said some pile about money. Go on, admit it. I just wanted to see you. Nothing wrong with that. How come you left it so fucking long? All right, it's true. There were times when I didn't think of you. For long times. Then suddenly, out of nowhere you'd-- you'd pop into my head and... I'd be your father again. And it was always better. You're the only treasure I got, Margo. And every time I'd think about you, I get a little bit rich. Then why didn't you send for me years ago? You got this money you say you have. You could've set yourself up in business instead of this. I mean, how much is it anyway? I never counted it myself. About eighteen thousand, Tavis said. Near as he could figure. This is the money you stole? The actual money you stole that what's-his face got killed for and the other guy and you went to jail for? I couldn't spend it, you see. Not with Tevis and Scobbie gone. Tevis tried to break out four times. Would you shut up about them! What are you telling me? You just walked into a bank and then you deposited it? Is that what I'm supposed to believe? No. We buried it. Tevis said he wouldn't put his money in a bank. Not with fellas like us around. Oh, that Tevis, he was one for getting a laugh. Even old Scobbie, propped up in the back of that Packard, holding his guts in. He got a laugh out of that one. We tried to find a doctor to help Scobbie. You got to understand, we were scared bad. We drove on all that night. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] So we wrapped up the money in Scobbie's slicker and we buried it under that tree and we drove on. Scobbie died that night. Tevis wouldn't bury him no place, except in Oklahoma, with his folks. Two days later they caught up with us. And I, for one, was glad. Cause Scobbie began to smell real bad. And we still had a long ways to run. It's all yours, girl. I just wish I had more. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING IN SPANISH] This is a night to remember. Make no mistake about that. DELBERT: Evangelina with her own picture show and me with my own daughter. Let's drink. How she loved to swing in the rain. It would rain and she'd come running to me and say, "Swing me, Dada. Swing me." And I'd wrap her up in my yellow oilskin. And we'd swing back and to. And the rain would be tapping away outside. You remember any of this? I remember the tree. It didn't go no place. Well, she was too young. Daddy's little treasure, she was. Wow. It's really something you two caught up with each other. I think it's great. You see, we're planning to take a trip, she and I. As soon as this darn foot of mine quits to hurting. Oh, this dumb thing in the world. Well, I'll drink to that. To your foot quittin' hurtin'. And to your trip with Margo. When you get to my age, journeys will be gravely considered. You hear what I'm saying, Eugene? Well, sure. MARGO: Dad, do you think you should be drinking so much with your foot like that? You're right. I'm gonna quit. [LAUGHS] Get ready for my trip. There you go. Thank you. Oh. Hey, you're as big as Scobbie. Took up a lot of room, I can tell you. We had to dig awful deep to put him down under. Evangelina? Smell it? My foot. Do you smell it? No, sir. Here you go. MAN: [SPEAKS SPANISH] Enjoying the movie? Yeah. It's good when you can't understand what they're saying. [SPEAKING SPANISH] DELBERT: ♪ There was a young man♪ ♪ Who got shot in the gut♪ ♪ Shot in the gut♪ ♪ Shot in the gut♪ ♪ There was a young man♪ ♪ Got shot in the gut♪ ♪ Down in Damarara♪ MARGO: You shouldn't be drinking! -It's bad for your foot! -Helps kill the smell! Can't you smell it? [GROANS] Oh! What happened? What happened? Look at his foot. Oh, Jesus. He's burning up. Evangelina! I don't smell like Scobbie, do I, Tevis? No, sir. No, sir. Come on, help me get him in the truck! Come on, move! Will you? Move! [GROANS] Come on, easy. Feet first. Come on. Let's go. DELBERT: Don't bury me, Tevis. Till you get me home. [GROANS] Goddamn, them Packards. I'm Scobbie. Why am I Scobbie? You're not Scobbie! Scobbie's dead! You're my daddy! I smell something. You won't throw me out if I smell bad, will you? No! Scobbie's dead. Okay? I'm gonna get you to a doctor. No doctors. My Margi will get here. She'll fix it. I'm here! I'm here! You asked me to come and I came! I'm here! It's a long journey. MARGO: We're almost there. Are we almost there?! It's waitin' for you, Little Treasure. [CRYING] MARGO: I just got here. I just got here. You sent for me and asked me to come and I came. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner. But... [CRYING] This is the death certificate. I think maybe you would wanna give this to Evangelina. What does she want with it? Well, she was with him for a long time. Doesn't have a marriage certificate, nothin' like that. I think she'd put some store in the paper. What does it say? It's the cause of death. "Insult to the heart, due to blood poisoning." "Insult to the heart". Doctors got some good lines, I tell you. [BIRDS CHIRPING] I'm sorry. And I am sorry for you, also. Maybe he wouldn't have died if I hadn't come. No. You come in time to let him free. That is why he has sent for you. [DOG BARKING] MARGO: Sure ain't lookin' forward to that bus ride back, I can tell you. Stick around. Give yourself a chance to-- Got a family to support. -You got a family? -MARGO: Sure. I got a Visa card. I got a Master Charge. I got three gas cards. Department store cards. All crying out for Mama to feed 'em. Oh, yeah. I remember them little bread snappers. What kind of work do you do? I'm a dancer. I'm a stripper. I take my clothes off. Oh. Well, that's, that's pretty interesting. Beats keepin' chickens where you can't find the eggs. I dance good and I take my clothes off good. But I don't do love numbers. And I don't go bottomless. You know, last year, I almost made the chorus at the Tropicana. What are love numbers? Where you pretend to fuck on stage. Oh. So what do you got to show a girl -on her last night here? -Well, that depends on what you got in mind. Oh, why don't we... get drunk and go dancing? Well, the first part I can manage. -Good. -The, um, second part, I'm not too sure about. Well, hell, I can dance well enough for the two of us. Here. -Just go with your ears. -Okay. Now, show me where the action is. -Huh? -Well, I do know where, um, uh, a jukebox that has great old music. It's... [CHUCKLES] [OVERLAPPING CONVERSATION] Oh, my God. Millie Jackson.

Do you think my... my father was crazy? Well, he was a little goofy there towards the end. But I don't think he was crazy. He said some pretty crazy stuff about money. You mean, like calling you his Little Treasure? Uh-uh, uh-uh. This was-- this was, uh, before that, when you weren't there. I liked that about swinging you under the tree, all wrapped up in the rain. He said he robbed a bank. He robbed a bank? When? Way back before I was born. Sounded like... the depression or something. How much did he get? Twelve years. He got caught? Yup. Him and two others. One of 'em died. Scobbie. What a name. Makes you wanna scratch yourself. I better change into something more comfortable than what I wore on the way down. Those pants nearly cut me in half. [SCOFFS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [BELL DINGING] I'll drive you to the border. Why would you drive all that way? I enjoy your company. Be a trip for me. I could use a trip. Okay? Okay. [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] MARGO: God, I can't believe that they blind these little birds just to make 'em sing better. EUGENE: I was blind once. My eyelids stuck shut. Some kind of infection. MARGO: Holy shit! You must have been terrified. -EUGENE: Uh-huh. -MARGO: How old were you? EUGENE: About eleven. Didn't make me sing any better, but I sure got good at praying. And your prayers were answered? I remember I was, uh, sitting up in my bedroom, waiting for my breakfast. And all of a sudden, it was like-- it was like the whole world just appeared. Thank you. It was like there were magic pictures in my head. Only I didn't, uh, I didn't remember the names of things I was lookin' at. I'd forgotten the names. Thanks. When I was in the seminary, I remember reading in the Bible somebody got his sight back, and said, "And he saw men as trees walking". Boy, I knew exactly what it meant. Well, how long did you stay in the seminary? Right up until Lucille came along. What would make you wanna go to the seminary anyway? Well, I thought I wanted to be a priest. Ah, I get it. And then Lucille came along and de-frocked you, right? EUGENE: So, we came out to California. Lucille took acting classes and I got various jobs. Finally ended up working with Pacific Exterminator. Catchy title, huh? Yeah, you know, uh, roaches, termites, those guys? I could tell you stuff about termites. Don't. Here. Tell me about Lucille. When did she start screwing around, hmm? How'd you know that? Never mind. Tell me about Lucille. Well, she got a part in a movie. She's pretty good, too. So at least the main actor thought. How'd you find out? Lucille told me. She said she thought our relationship was more platonic than sexual. Shit, I wish I could come up with lines like that. [ENGINE REVVING] EUGENE: One day I was rolling along to my local liquor store, and this BMW pulled alongside. It was Lucille. She was sorry she stopped me when she got a look. I'm not too impressive when I've been drinking. I think it's the eyes. What'd you do? She wrote me a check for five hundred dollars, got in her BMW and drove off. Whew. That's not bad for your first handout. That's what I thought. But I knew it'd be downhill from then on. So, I... cashed the check and I left town that very day. Didn't tell anyone. Didn't shut off the gas, nothing. Just... Blew down the road like an old newspaper. Exactly. That's exactly so. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [INSECTS CHIRPING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Puttin' on the miles, Margo. You look great. Yeah. Hey, uh, um, thanks for the ride. I had a good time. Yeah. Me, too. I can do it. I got it. I got it. I'll take those one, too. -Look, uh... -Here. I'd take you on through, but those guys would tear my truck apart. Wait till you see what they do to my suitcase. Yeah, I bet you got more in your suitcase than I-- than I got in my truck. Take care of yourself, Eugene. I'd kiss you, but I'd ruin my face. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Good morning. Do you have anything to declare? [ENGINE STARTING] But you have medical papers for it. All livestock require them. Livestock? It's a tiny little bird, for Christ's sake. -Look at it. -Well, I'm sorry. But the regulation is quite clear. This is livestock. I don't believe this shit. Sir, what do you do about all the birds that fly over the border every day? I mean, do they have medical papers? It is a legal requirement. You and your legal requirement. [ENGINE REVVING] [HORN HONKS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [PLANE ENGINE WHIRRING] [CHEERFUL MUSIC PLAYING] MARGO: Remember, I told you my father robbed a bank? Well, he told me what he did with the money. EUGENE: I thought he got caught. MARGO: He did. Before he got caught, they buried it. EUGENE: Buried it? Where? MARGO: In some old ghost town. North of Roswell, in Mexico. Behind a building that used to be a bank, they wrapped the money in a slicker and then they buried it under a cottonwood tree. That's what he said, anyway. EUGENE: Well, I heard him talk about a cottonwood tree. MARGO: Almost $20,000. I mean, wouldn't it be something if it was still there? -It'd be like a-- -EUGENE: Your legacy. MARGO: [CHUCKLES] Yeah, yeah. [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR OPENS] JOSEPH: You can provide your own linen or else we can rent it to you. Two dollars a week. What's the rent? Seventy-five dollars a week. Seventy-seven if you rent the linen. Much cheaper than any motel you're gonna find around here. You charge for grease in the place? Uh, you Manuel? No. Manuel was my wife's first husband. He killed himself with a car. -Hmm. -My name's Joseph. Hmm. Well, uh, mind if we talk this over, Joseph? Sure enough. -Hey, check this. -Yo. [LAUGHTER] JOSEPH: That sure is a fancy truck you're driving. You two honeymooners or something? -What did he say? -It's a dump. Well, it's cheap. He's right about that. If you're honeymooners, this would be the place. Used to be a honeymoon trailer. I fixed it up when me and my wife first got married. -Tropical style. -[LAUGHTER] Come on. What do you think, what do you think? What did you--shh, shh, shh. What do you think? We'll take it. Uh, for a week. MAN: [INDISTINCT] what are you doing? WOMAN: I'm [INDISTINCT] EUGENE: Thirty-six. Thirty-six ghost towns are marked on this map. Thirty-six? -Uh-hmm. -Shit. I thought there'd be two or three. Well, 36 isn't so bad. The man at the, uh, Chamber of Commerce said that most of them aren't there anyway. Just blew away. Oh, that's a big help. Gonna take us months. Can I have one of your cigarettes? Hmm. -Hmm. -No, come on. Let's say--let's say we see ten a week? That's one month. How much money have we got? Last count, a hundred and-- two hundred and sixty. Well, that'll last about two weeks. So we get jobs. -Jobs? -Yeah. When are we gonna look for ghost towns? EUGENE: On our weekends. Days off. That's gonna take us years. Oh, come on. It'll be like a hobby for us. I mean, plenty of people go hunting or fishing on weekends. We got good jobs. Get a nice, decent place to stay. It won't be so bad. Oh, hell, Margo, it'd almost be like real life. Well, I saw a bar on the way in that was advertising for go-go dancers. Can't be a hell of a lot in a town this size. Then I can get top billing in there as easy as falling in a hole.

Customers sitting there looking at this piece, shake her thing up there, and they're thinking a lot of good stuff about her. All I'm trying to say is, could be a real downer to find out she's laying the bartender. Kind of spoils the illusion, if you get my drift. Blind man on a galloping horse couldn't miss it. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] EUGENE: How far out of Roswell did he say? MARGO: He didn't. He just said north. Wouldn't it be great if we found it the first place we looked? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] -EUGENE: What's out back? -MARGO: Zilch. -EUGENE: No tree, huh? -MARGO: No. EUGENE: Map says it should be along here somewhere. MARGO: Well, maybe it blew away like that other place. EUGENE: There's no bank. No tree that I see. You sure you're remembering right about what he said? See anything back there? MARGO: Ah! It was a fuckin' rattlesnake! It went [HISSES] Watch out, there may be more down there. EUGENE: Okay. I think from now on you gotta wear some boots. -MARGO: Yeah, and I want a gun. -EUGENE: All right. MARGO: I wanna shoot those bastards with a gun. [GUNFIRE] Aha! Eugene, do you think if you'd stuck to your original profession that you'd be a saint by now? Hmm? I mean, who was that saint that got tempted in the desert, huh? Wasn't that Saint Eugene? Eugene. Saint Jerome. This truck's taking a beating out on these roads. We can get a new one when we get the money. Huh? I know what we'll do. We'll buy a convertible and then we'll go to Las Vegas, and check-in to Caesar's Palace and order room service. You know, those little tins of nuts and tabs, and cold sandwiches. What if we don't find it? Well, we'll find it. You just keep this truck runnin', we'll find it. I mean, it's out here under a tree someplace. Trees just don't blow away, do they? No. -No, they don't. -Well, that's what he said. Under a cottonwood tree, wrapped in a slicker. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] He also talked about another cottonwood tree. One he used to swing you under. And he said he wrapped you in a slicker to keep you from getting wet. That was a different tree. That was when I was a kid. Wait, wait, wait, wait. He also called you his Little Treasure, Margo. You know what I'm saying? I mean, he was kind of delirious at the time. And with you being there and everything. Yeah, I know what you're saying. You're saying it's all bullshit. You're saying let's quit because your fucking truck -is getting bounced around. -No, no, no. My truck has nothing to do with it. I just don't wanna see you getting fixed on something -that may not happen. -You're a quitter. Do you know that about yourself? That's why you're so fucking easy going. -Well-- -You quit already. -Hey, wait, wait. -SADIE: Hello, there. Everything all right with you folks? We heard-- we heard shootin'. Anybody get... in the way? No, no. We're fine. We, uh--we're just hunting beer cans. Ah. Where are you folks heading? -Uh-- -Hi. My name is Sadie. Uh, we're going out towards, uh, those two ghost towns. What were-- what are the names, Margo? SADIE: You mean, Dalla and Tishamingo. If you folks are heading up to Dalla, stop by. We could have a drink. It's getting toward that time of day. Um, maybe next time. Um, I think we'd better be heading on. I don't wanna be, uh, out here when it gets dark. Come by and see us. We'll have a drink. [ENGINE REVVING] -Hi, Joseph. -Hi. Hi, honey, hmm. -Close your eyes. -Why? Close 'em. Okay. Turn around. [LAUGHTER] Turn around. Okay. Now, are you ready? Yes. Ta-dah! Pretty good, huh? Huh? I mean, you said the old truck wasn't gonna last much longer. We don't wanna get stuck in the boonies, do we? How'd you get it? MARGO: I got it from Chuck, the manager. He finances autos. He gave it to me real cheap. Real cheap. -How cheap? -Twelve hundred. Twelve hundred, it's got everything. It's got AM/FM radio. It's got wide [INDISTINCT] it has factory air. It's got power steering. -Hmm. -It's loaded. I don't get you. You know that? -If you mind, Joseph? -Nope. Bye. -Bye, Joseph. -Bye. Because I thought-- I thought that we were gonna get out of this place when we got some bucks, huh? -Look, I didn't pay cash for it. -Oh, come on. God, I'm paying it off at two hundred a month. That's six months' worth. Well, actually, uh-- actually, it's eight, with interest. Eight. Hey, honey, when we get the money, you know, we'll just pay it off. We may not find the money, Margo. MARGO: Oh, God, don't start that shit again. Look, it's my bill, all right? Don't worry about it. I'm sick of eating dust. I'm sick of pounding around in that heap of scrap metal of yours. Look, Chuck says that there's an apartment that we can rent behind the club. I don't wanna live behind the club in Chuck's apartment. I don't even like you working there in the first place. What's wrong with me working there? -You work there. -Not naked, I don't! I don't go naked, Goddamnit! -I wear a string! -Well, you look naked to me, Margo! Well, they don't pay a hell of a lot if you wear an overcoat! [GLASS SHATTERS] [WEDDING MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: I think she's telling you something. What can I do for you, boss? I just came in from talking to young Norman Kane. Hmm. Is that my cue? Well, he liked your act. His whole party did. They want you to come back and do a private little show for 'em. I don't go for that kind of scene. CHUCK: Oh, come on, Margo. This guy has class. -Oh. -Comes from one of the finest families in the state. You won't get any kind of trouble there. Boy, now there's a theory. Christ, it's not like I'm trying to get you to screw anybody. Just trying to pass a little extra money your way. [SIGHS] What's in it for you, Chuck? Keeping myself on the right side of the right kind of people. Now, you've been around long enough to know how that goes. Everybody owes somebody. How much are they paying? There's a hundred in it. Make it a hundred and fifty. JOSEPH: Ah, mind if I come in? No. Sure, come on in. I was just sittin' around. I noticed your wife's car wasn't there. She working late? Kind of. You want a drink? Yeah. Well, I brought something along. You're a tequila man, I see. Yeah. Kinda got used to it down in Mexico. Well, Manuel, my wife's first husband, he was a tequila man. She made me promise I'd never touch the stuff. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GLASS CLINKS] [DOG BARKING] [OPERA MUSIC PLAYING] WOMAN: Bravo. MAN: Excellent. WOMAN: Wonderful. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] WOMAN: Let's go swing it. Uh, I've just gone through my repertoire. You never know what turns some people on. Chuck tells me you never drop your string. Never. Well, have a good time, huh? Follow the show. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] I don't mean to be crude, but when we in bed, I mean, me and my wife-- I mean, actually in bed, she'll say things like, "The garbage disposal broke again." And right in the middle, she'll say things like that. Hmm. That's bad, ain't it? It ain't good. Your wife ever say anything like that? Well, we don't have a garbage disposal. Well, you're better off without one. Them things can fuck up a guy's nooky something awful. SINGER: ♪ Silent night♪ ♪ Holy night♪ ♪ All is calm♪ JOSEPH: Your wife's a dancer, I hear. Yeah. That's so. Well, I hear she turns on a real good show. She can shake it. No doubt about it. This was our honeymoon trailer. I fixed it up myself when we first got married. Sometimes when it ain't rented, I like to come out here and just sit. Practice my whistling. I like to rent it to young couples. I gotta go now. I'm gonna pick up my wife. [OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Where are you going? I got another routine. Why don't you forget the routine and start from here? Look, if you like bare ass so much, why don't you just watch them, huh? Is that what you think this is about? I just wanna see your bare ass? Well then, why else would you wanna make me drop my string? I once bet five thousand dollars a grasshopper couldn't get off of a spoon full of honey. Five thousand dollars? -Did it? -Of course not. Nobody gets out of a spoon full of honey. -You want me to dance or not? -I want you to dance. No strings attached. Forget about the string, all right? I'm all for that. How much would it take to let you forget it? Why don't you think of it like an apron? When it comes off, you don't have to be the maid anymore. You'll just be naked like the rest of the guests. MAN: Oh! -Get him! Get him! -WOMAN: I got him! What do you get out of this? I don't know. Hasn't happened yet. And you don't know either. You know, it might not be such a big deal when it drops. I don't dance bare ass. We all dance bare ass, Margo. Just some of us don't admit it. A thousand. Wait a minute. Maybe a thousand isn't enough. Why don't you just dance to the music, let it fall, and I'll pay you what I think it's worth. You just might get rich and liberated at the same time. WOMAN: hey, that's enough. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [SOBBING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] It's time to quit, Margo. Maybe you're gonna let her decide that, huh? Come on. Let's go. Well, Margo, I said I would pay you what I thought it was worth. [SOBBING] Shall I settle up with you? You are right on the edge, Mister. That puts all of us in the same place then, doesn't it? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: Now you decide to join us. WOMAN: Yeah. And you're still dressed. Not fair. MAN: Hey, come out. WOMAN: Where's some towels? MAN: Here you can have one. WOMAN: Oh, gosh. Are you all right? WOMAN: I don't know. It's cold out here. [CAR ENGINE REVS] The fuckin' car won't start! Shit! [CAR ENGINE REVS] [SNIFFS] You okay? Are you all right? You know, I really almost did make it to the chorus of the Tropicana. [LAUGHS] I was too short. Not that-- Why don't you and I get married, Margo? Why? So you can take me away from all this? Because I have nothing but good feelings for you. I swear I don't know how you survived so long in this world, Eugene. We'll ran away. Well, when we find this money, we'll both run away. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [BIRDS SQUAWKING] [CAR ENGINE REVVING] EUGENE: Left is the way to Tishomingo. Right goes to Dollar. Where that old couple lives. That's not the place. How do you know? My father wouldn't bury it near two spooks like that. [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [WIND BLOWING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDS SQUAWKING] [CAR DOOR OPENS] What? What is it? It's here! -What is? -The tree! We found it! [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Well, tree, all right. I don't think it's a cottonwood. Since when are you a tree expert? It's just that I don't think it's a cottonwood. Well, it was behind the bank. How do you know it was a bank? Because it said so right on the sign out on the building. Ah! This is it! I know it! I know it! Get the shovels, Eugene! Let me loosen it up a little bit. -Huh? -Make it easier to get started. There's no rush now, Margo. You can take your time. You beginning to get some idea, Margo, just how much digging we got here? Even if we don't go any deeper than we are right now, it's gonna take us two, maybe three days. Well, what's your idea? We go hire a bulldozer? Look, if you really wanna do this seriously, you go back to town, you get provisions and you stay here as long as it takes. Hey, look, while we're standing here arguing, we could find it if we were digging. If this is the place! Goddammit! This is the place! You've been saying this isn't the place since we got here! This is the place! If we find it, then this is the place. If not, it's just some sick old man dreaming. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [THUD] [GRUNTS] Gonna kill the battery. Turn the light on. I can't see to dig. Turn the light on, Goddammit. How's that? It's fine. Come on. Get digging. This is not gonna work, Margo. What do you mean you're not gonna work? It's time to quit. Quit? We just got started. We're through. We're leaving. [LAUGHS] So we can come back tomorrow and find out some other people stole it? There's nothing to steal, Margo! Nothing to steal? You liar! You Goddamn fuckin' liar! It's just something that he made up. He didn't make it up! He wouldn't do that to me! All right. All right. Maybe he didn't make it up. Maybe he heard it or dreamed it, or read about it someplace, or maybe just got confused after all these years. But whatever it is, it is not what-- look at us! Will you look at us, for Christ's sake? I mean, we're out here digging away like crazy people for buried treasure! There is no treasure, Margo! Except you and me being decent to each other! Don't you understand anything? -Get away from me! -You fucked up, pathetic bitch! Get away from me! You know, you're wasting your life! And you're wasting mine! I--don't you know every time you stand up there and take your clothes off, I wanna cry at the sad sight you make! -You just wanna rob me! -EUGENE: What? That's right! You just wanna rob! Huh? You got nothin' worth stealing, Margo! You and you--your G-string. It's supposed to protect you- -your treasure! I mean, who wants it? Nobody, except me! You're too fuckin' dumb to realize it! I'm the only stupid son of a bitch that gives a shit whether you're naked or not! [GRUNTS] The show's over, Margo! It's all crazy! This money's here and my daddy gave it to me! It's crazy! [GUNSHOT] [GRUNTS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPING] No! [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [ENGINE STARTS] [THUD] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANS] No. There, go there. SADIE: Ah! Ah! Charlie! Charlie! Help! -Oh! -What happened? We had an accident. -All right. Let's get him-- -Oh, come in. Come in. --into the chair. Easy, easy, easy. Oh. Oh, honey. Oh, oh, honey. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Let me see that. Oh. Give me my keys. You're not leaving me here without my keys. But where do you want to go, honey? I just want [INDISTINCT] -Give me my keys! -You're warm. I swear to God, if you do not give me my keys, I will see you in jail. I'll take you any place you want to go. -Oh. -Listen to me. -If you-- -No! No! No! CHARLIE: If you're going to Roswell, you'd best get some stuff for this fellow's shoulder. SADIE: I'll take you back to Roswell. Sit down. Easy now. Easy. Sadie. Sadie, wait a second. SADIE: Yeah. Yeah. -CHARLIE: Just [INDISTINCT] -SADIE: Yeah. Yeah. CHARLIE: And you better get-- better get a little something extra. SADIE: No, you're paying? No. CHARLIE: Oh, this boy is gonna need a drink before the night is out. Oh. All right. I'll take care of you. Just take it easy. Let me look at that. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] CHARLIE: What did she-- what did she shoot you for? Had to be either love or money. But most likely-- most likely both. You know, I tell you, if she'd stood any closer, you'd have bled dry before we could have got you any place. Not too many more. Lucky for you they were number tens or else they'd be the devil and all to come out. If these were nuggets, you'd be one rich, sick fellow, or I would, seeing as how I am the one who mined them. You know, I've been mining gold for the best part of twenty years and I never had a pan this full before. There's gold here. And before this is over, Charlie Parker will find it. You know, what some folks don't understand, what's for you won't go past. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [SNORING] [WIND BLOWING] [BIRDS SQUAWKING] [METAL CLANKS] [GROANS] Oh! [BIRDS SQUAWKING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANS] [CAR APPROACHING] -Is it? -Of course it is. Good as gold. [EXHALES HEAVILY] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] CHUCK: Margo? You're on. [OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS] CHUCK: Hey, Margo! [KNOCKS ON DOOR] CHUCK: You hear me? [DOORKNOB RATTLING] [ENGINE REVVING] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] CHUCK: Hey, Margo? You're on. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] CHUCK: You hear me? [DOORKNOB RATTLING] CHUCK: I don't know what you got against the door. But if you don't get your ass out here, I'm opening the bitch! [KNOCKS ON DOOR] CHUCK: You hear me?! [KNOCKS ON DOOR] [DOORKNOB RATTLING] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] EUGENE: Hey, Margo? CHUCK: Hey, what you doing here? You're fired. EUGENE: Margo, you all right? Margo? It's Eugene. Open the door. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Oh. CROWD: Margo! Margo! Margo! You're fired. And you're on. You hear me? We got a deal. Uh-uh. Stay there, Chuck. [CROWD CHEERS] WOMAN: My God, is he gonna strip too? CHUCK: You're a pair of deadbeats! You deserve each other! EUGENE: Kill that music. Margo! I don't know what I thought you were, but I was wrong! Go on! Get the fuck out of my life! [LAUGHS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] You and me? [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]
