It's been hours, there's nothing here. Fishing needs patience, Man. Bro! There is no fish around here. You're wasting time. Fish somewhere else, bro. Thank you. Pari is approaching, over. Roger that, Robin. All units on alert. Why are you late? I'm asking you. Why are you late? There were some traffic jams. Jam, jam. -A heavy traffic jam, Pak Tam. You guys like to fool around, huh? Did you guys know that... ...the stuff you brought this time... ...the price is triple than usual? Really? We know. -We know that. Pak Tam, you are just a cripple. There's no need to remind us. Pak Tam. Where there's cash, there are goods, Pak Tam. Pak Tam. How is your daughter? Cik Li, that's mine. He has three daughters, we can have one each. I don't want to have sons-in-law, who are slowpokes like you. Very good. We'll get going then. All units, move in. Move in! Move in! -Roger that. Hey. What's that? Undo the ropes first! Give back the stuff. Give them back! -Pak Tam! Pak Tam. Pak Tam! Where do you want to run? -Don't you see who is coming? Yes, of course I see it. But our boat is too small. It moves like a snail. And the one coming is a seal. Then, do you want to just stay still? Say your prayers then. Mister. Robin. Robin, negative. There is nothing here. Only fishes. Where are the goods? Where is it? -What goods? What goods, idiot? -Don't act stupid! Where is that stuff? Another one. What are you looking for? The information we received are accurate. So where is that stuff? Bro! There is no fish around here. You're just wasting time. Fish somewhere else, bro. Who gave that kind of information? His father or yours? Stop! -Enough! Hey! The goods are not here. Come with me! Eagle One, what on earth are you doing? Eagle One in pursuit. Goods are in stingray two, over. Copy that. Felix, this is Robin. Eagle One in pursuit of target. On the move, heading west. Heading west, over. Copy that. That doesn't sound good. I don't like this sound. I don't like this sound. We're so done. Move! Give me a hand. What are you doing? -Open it! What are you going to do? What do you want to do with that? -We're going to use what we have! Illiaz! Hey, Demak! You go to the front with Illiaz. Whatever I have taken out, go and pick it up! Unless I say shoot, don't shoot! Follow my instructions! Shoot! Eagle One, this is Felix. Two suspects have opened fire. Intend to engage. You animal! Confirm, two men down, over. Roger. Sir! Two men down from the shoot-out. Permission to open fire. Roger this! ONE YEAR LATER Do you accept cards or cash here? You can use a debit card. -Debit card. That's convenient. RM150, okay. Where? Here? -Here. Okay. -Okay. So... ...this is the room key, sir. You can follow our staff. He will show you the room. Let's take a selfie. -Someone wants to take a selfie. Yes. Actually, I think she wants to apologise... ...for missing our engagement ceremony that day. Right? -Busted! What? -Smile! Smile. Let's go. Ravi, take care of the boat first. You can take turns with Daud. Yes, sir. No problem. Wow! You guys came to my party in uniforms. Sorry, sir. We just finished patrolling. So, we didn't have time to change our clothes. Oh, I see. Daud. Matbon. -Hi. Ikhwan, but this one is special. We call him Jambu. And this one is Tommy. Nadia, Nurul. Come here, quick. Come on! Hurry up. We have to go. -Please excuse us. Honey, I'll be waiting for you. Handsome boys, don't just stand there. Come join us. Faster! Thank you for coming. Fine, you guys can go. Excuse us, sir. -Not her. She has been smiling at me. -Why are you still here? Didn't you hear me calling you? -Mum, please. Why? Please, a lot of my friends are over there. Mum, I can't dance in front of my colleagues. What is wrong with that? Come on! You need to pull him. -Honey. Please, do it for me. -There you go. Hurry up. Ravi! -Sir! Don't forget to eat. Take turns with them. Yes, sir. Thank you. Peace be upon you, Melati. Sorry, I was busy just now. It's okay. I called you many times. I thought something happened to you. Well, anyways..... I'm actually calling you because... ...I want to congratulate you and Nurul on your engagement. Congratulations. Thank you. I never thought that you will be married before me. I'm more famous than you. It's time. So, what's your excuse for not coming to my engagement? It's nothing new, Hafiz. Operation Orders. We are still at sea. Actually..... Hello? -Actually Hafiz, I..... Hello? You're here all alone. What are you doing? Are you looking for inspiration or you've already changed your mind? It's not like that, Dad. I got a call from the office. Do you still have to work during your engagement leave? This is normal, Dad. It's the nature of this job. Twenty-four hours on standby. Dad. Honey? What are you doing here? Nothing. I received a call, so I had to excuse myself. Who called you? Melati. Melati. I have told you so many times. Melati and I are good friends. That's all. Melati, who called earlier, said... ...she was sorry she couldn't come to our party and... ...sent her congratulations to the both of us. Really? Okay, but... ...why didn't she call me too? Eat up. You want to grab coffee. This is the only time I can see your face. Otherwise, you'll lock yourself day and night in the cabin. What can I do, Pak Am? We're in the middle of the smuggling case. It's never-ending. It has been months and it's giving me a headache. You can ask me for help. Make me some coffee. Actually, I am so excited. -Yes, it depends on you. Sir. -I'm sorry. Darling. What? Darling, people are looking at us. You have another surprise for me? -Okay, relax. You've surprised me enough. -Let's gather here. Is everything okay? -I am sorry. I am sorry. We're experiencing a technical problem. I'll go check at the back first. Rin, faster. Get down! -Mum! Ravi! -Go check the boat. Honey? It's fine. Let me go and check the situation. Oh God. Oh God. Dad! -Just a moment. Everyone stay here. We don't know what's going on over there. Everyone gather here. Hafiz, the generator room exploded. Hafiz, Dad! -Oh God, Dad! Wait for a moment. Please! Wait! Mum, you stay here. Nurul, take care of her. I'll check. Honey, I want to go with you. -Please wait here. Jerrycan. Die! Ravi! You want to die? -Calm down, sir. On your knees! -Calm down, sir. Tommy. -Kneel down! Joko, Ravi, Diki! Tie them up. -Kneel! Get down! Grab them. Tie them up. Tie them up. -Get down! Are you scared? Scoundrels! Ijat! Shut up! Bangun! Honey! Honey? Do you really love her? You don't love her? Honey, please don't! Look. Of course, he loves her. Men's weakness is always women. -Honey. My oh my. Honey! Peace be upon you. Answer it, or I'll shoot. Peace be upon you too. Ladies and gentlemen. Sisters. My friends and I... ...would like to apologise for disturbing... ...the ceremony tonight. I came here with one purpose. My purpose is... ...I want to finish an old score. An unfinished business with..... Not with you. Not with you, auntie, and not with you either. But with this seal. Honey! -Sir! Hey! -Sir! Honey! No! Hafiz? Lieutenant Maritime Hafiz Osman. What do you want? Honey! Do you remember me? Samat. I am Samat. Ring any bell? Do you not remember me? Let me refresh your memories. Because of you... ...my men died. Honey! Please, don't! Please, don't! Because of you Rima died. Who is Rima, devil? Rima is my nephew! -Samat! Samat! Boss wants him alive. Samat, the boss wants him alive. Oh, really? Alive? -Honey. Take everyone on the boat. Kadok, send the others home. Consider it done. Whoever wants to go back first, come here. Walk. -Get away from me. Mum! Mum! Dad! One. Oh God. Two. Three. Allah is the Greatest. A hill. Male. Female. -Oh God, Oh God. I... ...kill. Amen. Did you say your prayers? He's already dead. Zan, stop the boat. Why are there too many people on the boat, Zali? You told me to bring everyone. It's true, Mr. Samat. I didn't say that. -I don't do anything... ...without your instruction. I only did my..... Impossible. I don't remember giving you that order. I just want this one. Others are just getting in the way. Tommy! Sit down! Sit down! Honey! Honey! -What are you doing? If I didn't shoot, you'd probably be dead. Will I? Fool. Mambang! It's done, Mr. Samat. Go and dive. Ma'am. Found them? Nothing, Mr. Samat. Hafiz. Move! Faster! Move. Come on! Move. -Faster! Move! -Move. Move! Move fast! Did I tell you to do that? He is not a private soldier. If he's really angry, we're done! -Hey! My goodness. Idiot! Shut up. Yes. -Where's the boy? That boy is dead. The body? Lost at sea. I want you to find him. He's not dead yet. Okay, I got it. Kadok, follow me. Mambang, prepare the boat. You Zali, I'm still not done with you, okay? Move. Cik Li. Excuse me. Are you sleeping? Wake up. Wake up! Kadok! Video. Poor thing. When I say action, you start talking. Action! During training... ...I never got shot. Now, I'm going to die. I'm going to die. Jambu! Who said you're going to die? Who said you're going to die? You won't die now. Say your prayers. Say your prayers, remember God! I'm in pain! -I know that. I know you are in pain. But you won't die like this, Jambu. Hey, Jambu. Your parents are waiting for you at home. You have to go back. You have to go home and see them. I'm the one in pain. I'm the one dying. Not you! Jambu, I promise you. You will survive. I'm hungry, sir. -Tommy. Once we're on land... ...I will cook for you, Tommy. POMA, this is Mothership. Received your message. Roger, out. Lieutenant Shahril, come here. Yes, sir. -Deliver this message... ...to Lieutenant Melati. Let her investigate this case. Brief me as soon as possible. -Roger, sir. Peace be upon you, ma'am. Peace be upon you too. -Ma'am, message relayed from FAD. Thank you. -Permission to carry on, ma'am. Roger, thank you. Ma'am. We have found 14 bodies. Twelve people are confirmed to be civilians. The other two are our members. We have checked this whole island. Confirmed, no survivors. The only ones left are these corpses. Anything else? -Yes. This is the victims' mobile phones. And one of the phones... ...belongs to Tan Sri Omar Adnan's daughter. Nadia Arisa. Can we access this? -Yeah, sure. Is it connected? -Yes. Uncle. -Hi. This is Uncle Rahmat. Okay, where? This is Aunt Khatijah. Very beautiful. Hello! -This is my best friend. Ma'am, based on the pictures in this phone... ...we estimate there are about... ...20 people who were involved in last night's incident. Jambu! Tommy, sir. -Tommy! Tommy! Jambu. Hold this stick. -Okay, sir. Tommy! Ma'am. Any news about Hafiz and the others? Negative, ma'am. Okay, thank you. Crewmen, sighted. Two survivors, two o'clock, low. Confirm visual. -Roger. I have visual, sir. Survivor, two o'clock, low. Prepare for winch-in. Confirm. Prepare for winch-in. Here. Take it. Where is Matbon? -Matbon is here. Nadia. -What do you want? If you guys want money, just ask my father. Your father? -Who is your father? Who is he? My father is a Tan Sri. Tan Sri? -Tan Sri's daughter. No wonder you're pretty. Help me. -Hey! Do not be rude. Hey! -What's wrong, Pak Li? She's a Tan Sri's daughter. Do you know what that means? Money. I know but let me have a go first. -Hey! We better tell Samat. If you want to die, go at it. Sir, we have located the box. Lever knife. I am... ...Maritime Senior Officer... ...Matbon. They want Maritime Lieutenant Hafiz... ...alive. Please don't. Captain sir, with your permission. Activate all assets and standby to track... ...their position when they contact us. Roger, proceed. Sir. -Jasmail, let's go. Hafiz, I'm so sorry for asking you to come here. Sorry. -Is the operations room ready? It is, but go and get changed first. Assist him. Okay, ma'am. On the night of the incident, nothing seems suspicious, sir. At around 2200 hours... ...13 armed men attacked Pulau Angin Timur. They cut off all communications. Disconnected the electric supply. Blow up our Seaboat and also the jerrycan. Sir, I believe that they... ...have planned this because they know... ...the ins and outs of Pulau Angin Timur. And we..... We are their target. You mean they are not kidnapping for ransom? Yes, sir. Their leader told me... ...there is an unfinished business between us. Sir. I think this case is related with our previous case. For your information, sir, we have found Matbon's body. His head was decapitated. We also received a message from the kidnapper. Seaboat, this is Mothership, over. Seaboat, this is Mothership, over. Seaboat, this is Mothership, over. Hey, Seaboat. -Ma'am. How annoying can you be? Rather than looking for a seaboat... ...that's already blown to pieces across the sea... ...you better think about how to get Hafiz, alive. I am Maritime Lieutenant Melati from... ...Malaysian Coastguard investigation department. May I know who's speaking? Melati! Melati! Melati, help! Melati! -Shut up. Let go, dimwit! What is your problem? What's all the noise? Nothing. Mum! -My boys... ...are having fun with my guests. Now I need to make sure the hostages..... Hey! Can you shut up? Shut up! Stop talking! Stop giving orders! Now, you hear what I want to say. As you know,... ...you already know, there are people with me. Not only Hafiz's fiance. But Hafiz's future father-in-law... ...Hafiz's future mother-in-law... ...and also a woman, who is a Tan Sri's daughter. Do you understand? Yes, I understand. I'm glad you understand. Now, I want two things from you. First, I want you to get me Hafiz alive. Secondly, I want you to prepare two million... ...in exchange for all my guests. But now..... Dang it! Almost got it. Did you get the location? -Yes, ma'am. Okay, good. Send all this information to me now. Roger, ma'am. This is an outline of our operations tonight. Mothership, Kilat 17, Kilat 16,... ...Team Eagle, Team Swordfish,... ...and this is the Kawah Cave area. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Time. The time is 1400. Okay, brother. -Yes. Hafiz, this is my undercover. He's my asset. I need him back alive. He has a scar near his left eye. My mission is the hostages. Not your asset, Melati. What is your problem? Hafiz, stop blaming yourself! Stop blaming myself? Melati, my friends died because of me! Norman, Jambu, Matbon. They all died because of me. Stop blaming myself? Hafiz, stop! -What? Just stop! Listen. I'm still here. Your other friends, they're also here. So let's do this. For Norman and the rest. Please. For Norman and the rest. In the name of God, Most Merciful, and Most Compassionate. O Allah. You are my pillar and I sought You for help. With Your Grace, I shall make my move. With Your Grace, I shall pounce on the enemies. And with Your Grace I charge for war. I bear witness that there is no god but Allah. I bear witness that there is no god but Allah. And I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. And I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. Mum. Mum? Mum. Mum! Mum! Mum, no. Dad! Help, Dad. Dad, please wake her up. Wake her up, Dad. You can move. Don't touch me! Nurul, help me. -Hey! Stop it! You, shut up! -Sit down! Sit down or I'll shoot you! Yes, brother. Samat, you listen here. Now, they have arrived in your area. Let them take you. Don't fight them. Help me! Die! Hey, enough! Serves you right! -Enough. Calm down! Kadok, you have to go back to the island. Why, brother? You have to return to the island tonight. Go, go! Move! Dad. Dad. Nurul. -Hafiz! Honey! Honey, you're alive. Honey, my mum is gone. -Darling, I'm here. Honey, my mum is gone. -I'm here. Uncle! -Nad! I'm glad that you're okay. -I'm okay. Are you okay? -I'm fine. My bullet didn't kill you, did it? On your knees! Kneel! Okay. Hafiz. Thank you for bringing back my asset. I don't care about your asset. I just want to know who is the mastermind of all this. What do you mean? Melati, do you really think... ...this happened because of the two million? Your asset told me that there is a "big brother". Now, go ask your asset about him. Take a look at my face. Does it look fine? It's bruised, broken, bleeding. You shouldn't have pulled me out now. I'm this close to catching the big ship. Li, it's been two years since you became Samat's right-hand man. You talked about big brother but so far there's no evidence at all. You think it's easy? Do you think it's that easy? I told you there's a ghost on this ship but you're not looking. I already looked for it! You knew he can kidnap... ...and can kill civilians. -Ghost! Now, do you know what's their motive for kidnapping the victims? I don't think it's just a coincidence that... ...it involved Lieutenant Hafiz and her fiance's family. What is their motive? Samat's instructions were very clear. We knew that there will be a ceremony. We knew who we had to take. We knew who we had to kill. Yes, come in. Sorry, ma'am. Officers and the investigation team have arrived. Okay, thank you. -Sure, ma'am. Li, eat and get some rest first. I will be back soon. Sir. This your meal, sir. What's your motive for kidnapping everyone on Pulau Angin Timur? Motive? -Yes, motive! I asked you, what is your motive? Wow! You asked me about the motive? Why don't you investigate your asset? Your asset. Who was trying to eat me alive? Do you think I don't know? Call him over. Let's do the interrogation here. Miss Melati, your asset. What are you doing? -I didn't do anything, ma'am. I only gave him food, ma'am. -You didn't do anything? I just gave him something to eat. -No. What did you do? Are you stupid? Go call Medic now. Medic! Zali, talk to me. Come on. Medic has arrived. Ma'am! Riska, no. Ma'am, he is dying. But this God-forsaken animal... ...shouldn't be touched with your bare hands. You need to cover your hands. Find a cover. Steer 200. -Steer 200. Peace be upon you, CO. Take the rest of them down. -Move! Move! Hafiz! -Don't act so surprised. Bring the old man in here. Sit down! Uncle Am, are you okay? Uncle Am. Uncle Am, are you okay? It's okay, Melati. It's okay. It's okay. What is the similarity between... ...Head of Maritime... ...and... ...and the Chief Pirate? The similarity is... ...they both have responsibilities. Mr. Hafiz, sir. Thank you very much. You've helped by bringing... ...my men from your boat... ...into this Mothership safely. Thank you, sir. Let's settle this matter. Finish everyone on this ship. Shut up, come with me. -Stand up! Move! -Go with them. You're so done. You wait here... ...because I want to talk to the person who killed my son. This is too hard, Dad. The first day... ...where I entrusted him to do the delivery... ...of things you deem illegal... ...was the day my son died. I decided to do it myself. Amir Hamzah bin Abdullah. You didn't even realise... ...that a criminal has already entered your house. Uncle Am..... -Mustafa. My name is Mustafa. Mustafa. You've made it difficult for everyone. You have killed innocent people. You have robbed blameless people. What you are doing now is wrong. Is it wrong? Am I in the wrong? Why should I feel guilty? Because it was not me. It wasn't me who was robbed, nor them my family, my children. Those raped and killed, they were not my family. None of them were my children. They had nothing to do with me. Okay. I am the cook. All the meals on this ship were prepared by me. Every one of you ate my dish, every single day. But one day when you say,... ...you don't like my food. Was it my fault? Should I feel guilty? Even when the problem was your palate? Well, if you understand... ...I'll give you one more chance. Think carefully. Give me a reason why..... Because Rima... Answer it. ...is still alive. Don't shoot! Bring Rima to me! Bring Rima! Bring Rima to me! Bring Rima! What is the status of the incident now? Honourable Dato' Sri. All the crew on our Mothership... ...have been poisoned by the PSMM officer, Dato' Sri. Thank you. -For your information, Dato' Sri. Two of our officers... ...Lieutenant Melati and Lieutenant Hafiz... ...have been kidnapped and held hostage... ...by a group of suspected pirates. They also took one of our assets... ...which is our speed boat. Dato' Sri. Okay, Activate Crevalle Ops. Search and reconnaissance. Get all information about this incident. ASAP (as soon as possible). -Roger, Dato' Sri. Brother. -There he is! Rima! My favourite nephew! Come, come! Hurry up! Faster. Brother. -Yes? This is money. -Money? I like money, but I'd rather have you back. Dad. Riska. Move! Stand up! Hurry up! What are you looking at? Hafiz. You be a good member of the Coast Guard. After this, learn to be a responsible father. You do your work, I'll do mine. And you pray. Pray you don't see me again. Why don't you just shoot him? You are lucky! Let's go, Rima. My boss. Very good. Rima! You look healthy. Good! Brother Mustafa. Brother Mustafa. Rima. I didn't think that I would get to see you this time. Stealth team in position. Team, move in now. Move in now. Your father wants you to be his successor. He's my successor. Long live Rima! -Long live Brother Mustafa! Long live Rima! -Long live Brother Mustafa! Stop. Let's eat first. Enjoy your meal. Eagle One to Mothership. Our asset is in good condition. We need to standby, over. After this, they wouldn't dare mess with us anymore. We're not scared of the enemies. They are nobody. Never! -But if you want it, sure! Come on, now. Tonight is very special to me. So..... My future successor and I... ...will do a performance... ...for all of you. Steady, Rima. Don't embarrass us, Rima. -Rima. Show us! -Don't embarrass us. Rima! Steady, Rima. -Rima! Show us! -Rima! Rima! Rima. Rima One, come in. This is the Mothership. Rima One, come in. This is the Mothership. Brother! That's your son! Mothership to Orca. Man down! I repeat, man down. Our agent has been shot. Copy that. Go! That's my son? Welcome. God has answered your prayers. Sniper team, take down the tower now. May we all be blessed. All units, shoot to kill. Last man, out. Move! Who is willing to die for me? Who is willing to die for me? Me! -I will die for you! Long live Brother Mustafa! Stop! Scoundrel! Go, go. Faster. Die, all of you! Heriq! Mothership, the main hole is clear. Confirming, asset down. Robin down. Requesting backup now! Cover me! Riska, take him out. Hurry, now. All team, target is on the move. Edry, cover me. -Yes, sir. Move! Alpha team, deploying now. Go! Swordfish, this is Eagle. I'm on point and moving in. I'm pursuing the target now. We meet again,... ...Madam Melati. Mothership, I'm approaching the target. Missed the shot. Hey, dimwit! I purposely didn't shoot him. If really want to, his head would've splattered! Just shoot him. Don't drag it out. I thought you want him dead. Yes, true. I really want him dead. But I don't want to kill him with a gun. What do you want to do now? Stare at him? What are you talking about? Shoot or beat him up? You, shut up! I have an important score with this boy. Your gun. They want you to take off your vest. It's not fair, your clothes are heavy. Ma'am. I think you'd better put it back on. I don't want to deform your beautiful face. Come on. I told you. You have a scar on your face now. Ready? Yes. Careful, or it might backfire. Backfire, huh? I hate it... ...when someone disturbs my meal. Bob! Sir! My name is Mustafa! Mustafa! I told you. You should stay home. Learn to be a good husband. And if there is a chance... ...learn to be a good father. We... ...are not done yet. Not yet. We will continue this later. Bob! HEAVEN In the name of God, Most Merciful, and Most Compassionate. All praises to You, O Lord of the worlds. Peace and blessings to the prophets and messengers... ...and to their family and friends. O Allah, forgive them,... ...have mercy on them... ...and pardon them, O the Ever-Forgiving. O Allah, forgive the sins of our brothers. Place him, O Allah... ...amongst your most faithful servants, the martyrs... ...the prophets, and the messengers. Our Lord, give us in this world that which is good... ...and in the Hereafter that which is good. Protect us from the punishment of the Fire. Send Your grace, honour, and mercy upon Muhammad... ...and upon the family and friends of Muhammad. All praises to You, O Lord of the worlds. TWO YEARS LATER Can I get your order? -Okay, I'd like to have... ...two grande chocolate cream chip frappuccinos. Another one, grande caramel frappuccino. Boss, the coast guard boy is here. Should I proceed? Thank you. -You're welcome. I will have my revenge. Just you wait!
