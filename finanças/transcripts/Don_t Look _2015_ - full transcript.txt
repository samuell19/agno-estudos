I mean, you have a chance reap retribution for all of his crimes against humanity and you'd just shoot him? - Strangling, stabbing, drowning. - Fire or decapitation. - Yeah, beheading, disembowelment, yeah! - Almost there, babe, less than an hour, okay? - Alex, let's think of the children, all right? Those innocent little children. - And women! - Yeah, and all those freaking ridiculous outfits and all those fucking glasses? I mean, if I have to hear one more, "Bieber, Bieber!" Ugh. Bieber, Bieber, Bieber! - We have to stop, we gotta stop. - Super cute. 'Bout time, it was getting cramped up in there. I just got shocked! - Careful, all that fresh air's gonna shock your system, you know? - I can see you, Ted. Smells like manure out here. - Can't even get any signal out here, man. - Oh, poor boy. So, are you seeing Alex again? No, we're just friends. Really, the way he looks at you? Oh. And you guys were cuddly in the car. Lorena, you know he means a lot to me. Enough to bring him over for Thanksgiving. He's shy, he had no where to go. Watch it with the shy ones. Oh, please, he's just an old-fashioned guy, he grew up in the church. Ugh, I'm out of paper. Thank you. What's up with you and Ted? That story hasn't been written yet. Be careful, I don't like him. Don't worry, I know how to handle his type. He's super cute. - He's kind of a jerk. - I just wanna fuck him and chuck him, not marry the guy. Don't look at me like that. I know that look. You're not the one facing four days of no sex in the sticks. Let's go. - This is how people used to communicate. - Wow. - Ah, that's crazy, man. "Lost dog." "Small Ewok went missing." - Look, "Please butcher before returning." - Missing cow. Ooh, let's take guitar lessons. - Oh, look who's back. Look who's back. - So this is it for you Nicole, then? Inherit the farm, move out here, leave it all behind. - Less than an hour, right? - Yeah, 42 minutes. - Pee breaks done, ladies, gentlemen, back to the car, please. Mademoiselle. Thank you. - Hopefully we'll get some signal at the house, man, jeez. Ted, make a right up here, please. - Right here? - Yeah. - Here it comes. - Oh yeah, Shepard's Farm. - Right here. - Yeah. Nice. - Woo, this is pretty. - Nice right? - Whoa. - So excited. It's gonna be fun! - Si, senorita. - Come on, man, I'm gonna smack you. All right. - Thought your name was Harris. Harris? What's with this whole Shepard's Farm? - I'm still not getting any service on my phone here, man. Mmm mmm mmm. Hey you. - Well, hi. - You come here often? Yeah, drop it right here. - Seb mentioned your family has a ranch in Austin, you must know a lot about this farm stuff. - Not much of a farmer but I do know a little bit about plowing. - Farmer Ted? Oh, please. Ranch is just Upper East Side for the house with all the horses. - Let's go, guys. - Sebastian. - He serious? Ted's such a douche bag, man. - Hey, Nicole! - Hey babe. - So this is cozy. I could think of another word for it. - My dad's. He liked to hunt. - Obviously. - One of the few things I remember about this place. - Well I can definitely see why you didn't mind everyone crashing our weekend getaway. Safety in numbers? - Fuck's sake, it's freezing in here. - This must be for that old bus out back. - Well, seeing as am I am the only here that actually knows how to drive this thing, I am going to have to teach you and I am going to have to take it for a ride, blow some doughnuts, make sure everything is in proper working order. - Yeah, okay. Still not getting any signal. - This place is incredible. - Yeah, the fresh air is a little scary. - Well I'm glad we stayed behind. - Hey, freeloaders, we need firewood. - On it! So, Ted, do you wanna grab some firewood with me? - Yes, Lorena, I would like to get some firewood with you. I'm so glad they called the power company. How far you think Nicole lived? I don't know, I've never even heard about this place. It's really pretty cool. It's kinda sexy. What's in here? - Wanna check it out? - Yeah! What is this? Whoa. - Wow. - Shut up! - Seriously? We are not in the city any more. - Yep, it's definitely real. - Ugh. Stop. Can definitely be defined as bacon. Oh, sexy. "This little piggy went wee wee wee." Stupid. Lorena? Lorena? Bonita? Lorena? - Boo! - Oh, shit! You scared the shit out of me. Oh my god. - You scare too easy. Come on. - You're bad. - Thank you. Nicky! Lorena! - Nicole, Nicole! Nicole, Nicole! - One of you Harris? - I am. And you-- - None of your goddamn business. Our rent's paid 'til the end of the year. Can't just show up here and push us out. - I think there was a little bit of a misunderstanding. - The only thing that you need to understand is that's my cabin and this is my meat! And I know my rights. - Actually it's her cabin and about your meat, I don't think she's really-- - Why don't you mind your fuckin' business? I'll mind mine. We understand each other? Hmm? - Come on guys. Come on. - Go on. - I dunno, beats me, I never had a tenant. - Well there's gotta be something in that paperwork, something like some kind of anti-serial-killer shit, some clause or some shit. - Can we not talk about the hillbilly horror freak show out there? - Have I got a treat for you guys. - Yay! - I know! I pulled out all the stops for my guests. - Your cooking's legendary. - What can I say? ♪ Man didn't feel the same ♪ - Whoa, what happened there? - Oh. Appendix. - Really, 'cause kinda seems like it's on the wrong side. - This is just unsanitary, isn't it? - Here we go, the staple of any not really Thanksgiving Thanksgiving dinner. - Wine, darling? - Some vino and... - Of course tequila! - Yeah! Tequila! - Hey, guys, I think... - I don't know. Oh. Come in. - I'm afraid we got off on the wrong foot. I'm Kelley. This sweet potato here is Sherri Baby. 'Cause the holidays and all, we wanted to apologize. - Yep, we're sorry. - Oh. - I guess I better change. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Thank you. - Thank you, God, for this food and the bounty and our new friends here and amen. - Amen. - Perhaps a career in hospitality would be a good next step for you two, you have a way of making people feel at ease. Maybe a bed and breakfast? - I haven't had much chance to make any decisions regarding the farm. - Okay, well it seems like we're gonna have ourselves a bird after all. - You fuckin' shy? Dig in. - Come on, now. Jesus Christ, it's just a little bunny wabbit. - Thank you. - What's wrong, little girl, not hungry? Or are you afraid it's gonna bite you? - I'm fine. - I like you. I like this one. Spicy. - Yeah, baby girl. What kinda spice is that, exactly? - That'll be Puerto Rican. - I ain't never had me no Puerto Rican before. - Just try to be nice. - The fuck are you saying? - I'm gonna go get more drinks. Stupid girl. What a stupid girl. Spicy. Ever drink booze not made in a bathtub? It's a real treat. - You know, some men like a woman that'll do as she's told. But me... I like mine with a little fight in 'em. Lorena, hello? Lorena, are you okay? - I'm fine. I'm fine. - Oh, she's fine. - It was just a slip, he'll clean it right up. - Drinks? How 'bout you, Miss Monroe? What's your poison? - Well I could just suck the venom outta you, how would that be? - You sure aren't shy about your sluttery around your pops here, are you, Daisy May? - Oh, does that bother you, Daddy? - Woo! No, baby girl, it don't bother me a damn bit. Jesus Christ, all you folks thing everybody outside the suburbs is fucking their sisters. How 'bout you, sweet thing? You wanna be my sister? - Okay, I think you better go ahead and call it a night. - We was just leaving anyway. - I could stay up all night if you can, pretty boy. And I don't mind company. - "And I don't mind company." - That was fucking mental. That was insane. - Come on, man, that had to been funny, you had to have seen-- - Where'd those people come from? Well, I'm gonna go too, come on. Oh, and can you guys grab some beers? - I mean, really, really? Everyone is really not fully appreciating how fucked up that was. We're on a farm stuck with a David Lynch remake of the fucking Clampetts. And the rabbit! I mean, why are we not talking more about the rabbit? - Yeah, actually I wanted to talk to you about something. I just didn't want Nicole to get suspicious, you know? - Hey man, I'm ear for you, I'm all heres. Okay. Well, I'm glad. It's just that it's been months since, you know, Nicole and I started dating and I haven't gotten. I haven't been able to... I haven't slept with her, you know?
