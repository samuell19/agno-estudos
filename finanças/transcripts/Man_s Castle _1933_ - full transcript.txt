What's the matter? Come on, spill it. I've been watching you since you sat down here. You were rehearsing an act or something. What is it? Please. Wait a minute, why rush? - Let me go or I'll .. You'll what? Get down on my hands and knees for some of that popcorn. Hey, what is this? I thought I was hip to all the pan-handling routines. Or are you the little girl reporter working on a sob-story? Because if you are, I can give you some small dope on these pigeons. Now you take that one there for instance. I call him Oliver Twist. Yes, he's always asking for more. And that little fellow over there. See that one. Wait a minute. Are you really hungry? I ain't eaten in two days. - Two days? Why not? I haven't any money. Neither have the pigeons, but they eat regular. It would be great to be a pigeon. There's always someone throwing them crumbs. If you had the brains of one of them pigeons you wouldn't be hungry. Come on. Let's eat. For a pint-size like you, you can certainly put it away. You were hungry alright, weren't you? - Uhuh. But if you think I fell for your line of hooey, you're crazy. No female has to starve in a town like this. You ever been out of work for a whole year? I've been out of work all my life. Besides, the unemployment situation has got nothing to do with women. Did you ever think of that? Yeah, I thought of it. Oh? I couldn't. Oh, I suppose the river would be better than that, huh? Yeah, I thought of that too. I was down there this afternoon, but .. I was afraid. How are you ever going to get anywhere if you are afraid of everything? I guess I just won't get anywhere. You're not eating. Nah, I ain't hungry. Have you ever been hungry? Nobody ever has to be hungry anywhere. That's alright for you to say. You're rich. Call the manager. - Anything wrong sir? No. Everything's fine. I just want to talk to him a minute. Yes, sir. You know you should never ought to skip meals. That's the best food ever I ate. I feel better now. You look better too. If you fell down here at night, you'd get by in a crowd at that. You can't help the way you're made. - Why can't you? You wish to see me? - Yeah, yeah. Sit down. There's twelve million people in this country without work. Did you know that? Yes. Yeah, and a lot of them are starving, so they tell me. Now take this young lady here for instance. Up until an hour ago, she hadn't eaten for two days. She was starving. I brought her in here and fixed her up. She feels swell, now. Says it's the best food she ever ate. Well, I'm glad to hear that. Thank you. Yeah, the funny part of it is, she ain't got a dime. And neither have I. So the feed is on you, brother. Now. There are lots of ways to handle a case like this. You can call in the cops and have the two of us thrown into the can. They'll send us up to Island. We'll be fed by the state for 30 days, at least. But the more lags the state has to feed, the more taxes you guys have to pay. Is this your idea of a joke .. - Now, wait a minute. This joint throws out enough leftover grub a week to feed a thousand people. You can afford one on the house once in a while. Well, am I right or wrong? I'll tell you what I'll do with you. I'll put it to your own customers right here in this place. I'll ask 'em if it's fair to let someone die of hunger right outside your place. And if they say I'm wrong I'll admit it. Ladies and gentlemen! According to the newspapers, the banks in this country are full of gold. The granaries are bursting with grain. And yet there are twelve million people out of work. Twelve million .. Get out of here. Get out! Okay. Take it easy. Take it easy will you, pal. The case is dismissed. Come on. Miss. Nothing like a good walk after dinner. Where do you live? I might as well take you home. That would be alright if I had a home. - Hey, wait a minute. Say, have you got anything? Where did you expect to spend the night? I don't know. - You got a satchel? Well, go and get yourself one somewhere. Go to a hotel and stay there. When you get the bill, say you're broke. Then? They throw you out. Get another hotel. I couldn't do that. - Why not? I .. I'd be afraid. Do you live in a hotel? That way? No. No, I got no use for hotels. What do you do for a living? - I live. Close your eyes a minute. Close them. Now open them. Pretty huh? Yeah, sure. Two bucks a day for this. I just walk up and down and turn the light on and off. Your regular job? I don't believe in regular jobs. I do this for a friend. I sub for him on his night off. All you got to do is walk up and down? - That's all. Is it alright if I walk up and down with you? Sure. It's a free country, ain't it. Well, I suppose I got to find you a place to sleep tonight. What's your name? Trina. What's yours? - Bill. Bill. Here we are, Whoosis. Bagdom on the Hudson, the fastest growing community in the East. You'll find more unemployment here than in any other place in the world. The city gave it to the boys and girls to loaf in. How do you like it? Oh, it's swell. Gosh I've been here a year and never knew there was such a place. That's one of the things about it, the privacy. It's the only way to live. No rent, no taxes, no nothing. Running water? A whole river of it. [ Train whistle ] Hear that? That's what I like the best, them train whistles. They remind you of other places. Don't you love the sound of it? It's a scary kind of noise. - Nah. Gangway! Get out of my way! Here I come. That's what it says. Like a long-distance call. Come on. Hi Frank. - Hello Bill. Which one of the houses do you live in? - None. Mostly, I sleep in the open. When it rains I can choose. They're all my pals here. I can bunk with anyone. They must be swell people. - The best. It's funny. If people got nothing, they act like human beings. We get along swell here. It's like one, big happy family. I can't pay if you if I ain't got it, can I. Yeah. I'll find some way to collect. - Yeah, what will you do, sue me? I don't let nobody cheat me out of what they owe me. I didn't say I wouldn't pay .. You had the money a dozen times but you ain't got no intention of paying. You crummy heel! Go on, you cheap Moocha, before I slap you down. Bragg, what's the matter? I can't pay her what I ain't got, can I. It just so happens I got paid off tonight. There you are Floss. Come on, scram. Now you owe it to me, Bragg. They're just kidding. Down in the house, they're crazy about one another. I was going to ask Flossy to put you up for the night, but maybe that's no good. If she spends that dough for gin, she might not be much of a roommate. I could sleep in the open, I guess. - No, no. That takes practice. I got it. I got an idea. Follow me. What's the good word, Ira? And seeing the multitudes he went up into the mountains. And his disciples came unto him, and he taught them, saying .. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. That's the good word. That looks like that bible I swiped out of a hotel last week. The good word is free. I only wish I could get you to read it, William. I did. I skimmed through it one night. Kinda repetitious in spots, but there's some good reading in it. Ira, I want you to meet Whoosis. Ira here used to be a minister. Now he's a night watchman. How do you do? - Nicely, thank you. Yeah, nicely, except she ain't got a place to sleep. I thought after you checked out she could park here for a night. You're welcome. - What time do you go to work? Eleven-thirty. - Alright, you check in about twelve. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. - Come on. The reason I like to sleep on that barge is because there's no roof on it. Oh, it must be wonderful with the water rocking it. Like a cradle sort of .. Look at them ships down there with the sails on them. They look so peaceful, and contented. Come on, they've been laying there for years, rotting away with barnacles. That's what happens to you when you're anchored. All in all, it's so restful. - Restful? So is a graveyard. Where are you? Here. Where? Here! What are you doing? Taking off my clothes. What are you doing that for? Warm as milk. Come on in. I would if I had a bathing suit. What you want me to do? Come up and throw you in, clothes and all? No! I'll race you. - Where to? To the moon. - Alright. Where do you get all that energy from? Every time I see you, you're working. - Well, Bill is particular. Everything that goes next to his skin has got to be clean. You know, I expect he's the cleanest man in the world. One of these days, he's going to buy me a washing machine. That ain't so important just yet. The main thing is the stove. What's the matter with the one you got? I can only make stew on it. I could cook Bill some wonderful things if I had a real stove. He's going to get me one too. - When? Oh, pretty soon. As soon as he gets the money. Who ever heard of a Bindlestiff getting money? What's a Bindlestiff? A guy who can't stay put. Except maybe in jail. Well, Bill's no Bindlestiff. He can make all the money he wants if he wants to. He's got personality, he has. He's different. If he were different, would he keep you in a dump like this? Oh, Flossy. How can you say things like that? This ain't a dump. Not to me, it ain't. It's sort of uh .. What do you call them places in a street where you wait until the traffic's safe? Safety zones. A safety zone, that's it. That's just how I feel about this place. Like a sort-of clearing in the forest. Where everything is quiet and safe and peaceful. [ Train whistle ] That's the only thing I don't like. Them train whistles. They plague the life out of you, night and day. Now what's that? That's Bill's idea. He's an outdoor man, he is. He can't stand sleeping under a roof. Oh well, that's alright for him. But what about you, huh? You'll catch a cold one of these days. I've had one ever since I've been here. You don't happen to have something around that is good for a cold? A little Scotch or rum? Maybe a little gin. - Nope. Does that guy give you anything? He gives me everything, Flossy. Everything anyone could want. Excepting a stove. Who let you out? What are you doing here? I .. I was just admiring that stove. That one. It's beautiful ain't it? And cheap too, only 5 dollars. That's 5 dollars down and only 2 dollars a month for only 12 months. No interest. No interest is right as far as I'm concerned. I don't go for instalment plans. - In a year, that stove is ours. A year? You think I'll hang round this town a year? Never stay in a town over 30 days. Hung around here too long as it is. It's such a beautiful all-round kind of stove. Forget it. But we could start with one a small one. By paying 2 dollars down and a dollar a month. Forget it. What's for supper tonight? Stew. - No kidding? Go on home. Bill. Go on home. Hey, Bragg. I was looking for you. Where's the two bucks you owe me? What you hounding me for? Only a week's .. I know Flossy. It don't pay to stall me. - Stall you? Well, I've worked my head off trying to get the dough to pay you back. I'm working right now. - You don't look it. What kind of work? Serving a summons. What I mean is, trying to serve a summons. You get two bucks a throw. This one's so tough there's a bonus goes with it. Ten bucks for this one. Why not serve it and get your money? Why don't I? What do you suppose I've been trying to do for three days? It's for a dame in a show. You can't get to her. What do you mean you can't get to her? - She's got a bodyguard. What do you have to do with the summons? - Hand it to the party it's made for. Let me see it. For handing this hunk of paper to a dame, you get ten bucks? Cash. - You can't do it? I ain't the only one. I'm the third guy that's tried this week. Ten bucks, huh? Suppose I serve it for you, I could use five bucks. Will you split? I say it's impossible. You can't get to her. She has a bunch of gorillas around her day and night. But will you split? - Sure, but you can't get to her. "Well, it's great, it's grand." "Something unexpected always has the best effect." "So try to understand." "And cut out your promises baby." "And give me a big surprise." "Do what your mama says baby." "Kiss me and then .." "Kiss me again." "Your love has got that .. oh .. to it." "Oh, how it satisfies." "I'm used to petting, but when you do it .." "Oh .. surprise." "Come a little closer, dear." "And tell me what I want to hear." "You could never over-sell me." "When you tell me those little .. white .. lies." "Oh, baby, you've got me hoping and scheming." "Please let me shut my eyes." "So when I open them, I'll start screaming .." "Ah .. surprise." "So, cut out your promises, baby." "Give me that big surprise." "Do what your mama says, baby." "You're out of school." "Oh kiss me, my fool." "Your love has got that .. oh .. to it." "Oh, how it satisfies." "Now, I'm used to petting, but when you do it .." "Oh, surprise." "Come a little closer, dear." "Tell me what I want to hear." "You could never over-sell me." "When you tell me those little .. white .. lies." "Oh baby, you've got me hoping and scheming." "Please let me shut my eyes." "So when I open them, I'll start screaming .. ahh .." Surprise. Why .. what's that? That's a summons. And you can't say I didn't have witnesses either. A nice little act you got there, baby. Where do you think you're going? I think I'm going to buy a stove. - I think you'll need a stretcher. What's this here? Oh Ira gave me that. He wants me to read it when I've got nothing else to do. Oh. You're a heck of a looking woman for a guy like me. Uhuh. I know this isn't going to be a very good stew. Look at you. Skinny as a rail. That was not a good idea. I put those potatoes in too soon. Who wants to grab hold of a load of bones? That's all you are, bones. You know that? Yeah, but I'm young kinda. - That don't make no difference. Maybe it does. Maybe I'll fill out after. No .. you'll never look like a woman. You ain't got it in you ever to look like one. Why worry? As long as you're good to me? I ain't good to you. Don't get that idea into your nut. It's what spoils them, being good them. You must step on it if you want to stay with me, or get your teeth knocked out. Ha. Hmm, I think I ought to knock them out anyway. Come here. Oh Bill, what happened to your forehead? - Never mind my forehead. Little old Whoosis. You dames get some phony ideas alright, don't you. Go on, go to work. And if that stew is burnt, I'll pour it down your back. Hey, what you want to do? Break it? - No, no. Take it easy. No, we're just looking it over. Hey, stupid. Oh .. Bill. Oh Bill. Ahh. Bill, I .. [ Whistles ] Hiya mug. Gee Stilts, where you been? Thought you died or something. Where are the Yanks playing this week? - Chicago. Alright. You told me you wanted Babe Ruth to autograph a baseball for you, right? Well, I had to put it up to him, didn't I. Did he, did he, do it? Close your eyes. Come on, come on. Quit kidding around. Close them tight. Now open them. Gee, thanks Stilts. Gee Stilts. Yeah, I had to go all the way to Chicago to talk to the Babe. Hop a freight? Yeah, yeah. Rode the rods all the way. Ain't got the cinders out my hair yet. And did Babe write this himself? Why certainly .. in person. Thanks Stilts. "And some will hide away." "And be happy." "For just a stolen hour or two." "I'd give a lot if I could simplify." "This mess we're going through." Is that it? - That's it. "How much longer .. must I .. long .." "For .." "You?" That's it. Hey .. you. - Hiya. Well .. big boy. Got any more summons for me? - Not today. Do you know I called the lawyer's office? And left word I had to see the guy who served those papers on me. Yeah. They sent me somebody by the name of "Bragg". I asked him to get in touch with you. Did he? Yeah. Why didn't you look me up? - I was busy. What doing? Stilt walking? What's the idea of the ballyhoo rig? Well, I tell you lady. It's like this. There's this hardware store that sold a stove to a friend on an instalment plan. And today's the first of the month. I get a dollar an hour for this brand of street-walking. I need 2 bucks so I walk for 2 hours. Want to hear the story of my life? I'd love to. What are you doing this afternoon? Anything that appeals to me. I'm in suite 1242 at The Towers. Huh? The number is on the door. Where's Bill? Out somewhere. - Where? I don't know. That's a fine man you picked yourself, kid. Yeah, well he suits me. Yeah, but do you suit him? You wouldn't think so the way he's always playing you down. Crabbing about how skinny you are. - Well I am skinny. No you're not .. you're slim. But not skinny. I know what I'm talking about. You'd better not let Bill find that out. He's got a temper he has. He's likely to break you in half. Right smack in half. Oh no he won't. Bill's too busy. Busy with what? All I know is there's a blond actress been on his trail lately. Well, what about it? You don't care if he goes out with other women? He can go out with forty women if he wants to. I've got him. Not that I believe you. Bill's no cheat. If he wanted anyone else, he'd come to me first and tell me about it. Well, if he ever does, you know where I'm at. You? If I'd never met Bill and you were the last man on earth you couldn't get me. Now, how do you like that? Swell. Gives me something to work on. Different men work in different ways. Me, I got one principle. Take your time. I don't want to listen to you anymore. Get out of here Bragg, and stay out. Sure. There's no hurry. So, when you served those papers on me. You let me in for a suit for 10,000 smackers for "alienation of affection". What do you want to go around alienating affections for? Well, the guy angeled my act. Can't get backing without some kind of an I.O.U. What do you want from me? More backing? No. You're not the angel type. What's the party for, then? Just to get acquainted. You certainly showed up the 3 little Fauntleroys .. Who were meant to keep the bailiffs away from me. Midgets. - Ha-ha. Well, I gave them the air. I'm in the market for a new bodyguard now. You don't need a bodyguard. You look like you can take care of yourself. I always have. Oh, it looks like rain and there's only five shows today. You don't have to be afraid of me. I've got nothing up my sleeve. Honest. Nothing I haven't seen. How old are you honey? - Old enough to know better. You know. I got an idea that I won't be round here when that suit against me comes up. I've got a chance to go to London. London? You might as well stay home. Italy is the place. Was you ever in Italy? No. Were you? - No, but I'm going. Boy, there's a place. Italy. All they do over there is ride in boats and play guitars. I met a little Italian tomato once. Boy, was she able. Ever since, I had a yen to go to Italy. A guy can do himself some good there. I bet you know all about women. I know one thing about them. All of them. What? - They're all female. Is that a complement or a pass? - It's a fact. You're a funny sort of a beetle. - No kidding. Hello Bill. Your dinner's cold so I put it in the stove to warm up. I already had dinner. Kind of hot today, wasn't it. Why not say what's on your mind? Why don't you squawk because I came home late for dinner? You got a right to come home late, Bill. Maybe I should have telephoned. How could you with no phone in the house? I suppose I ought to make up excuses for being late. Listen, Bill. You don't have to make any excuses to me for anything. You know you don't. You're your own boss, Bill. Darned right I am. - Sure you are. Did you pay the instalment on the stove? - Yeah. Here's the receipt. Now, you see how easy it is? In nine month's that stove is going to be ours. Oh, I bet you're tired. Come on, honey. Lie down. You big butterfingered Palooka. Gee Red, something must have got in my eye. Yeah. Freight cars. You gotta keep your mind on the game, not look at trains like you always do. Oh listen, Red. I don't want excuses. Something's come over you in the last few weeks. You've been no good to us. - Don't I get another chance? No. Give me your glove, You're through. Hey, Slacks. Listen, Red .. Go on .. scram. Come on fellahs. How you doing, Ira? Oh .. coming along. Danged weeds grow as fast as you can pull them. That's a dire-looking layout if I ever saw one. Hey, you have to give them time to come up. There is no special hurry. What kind of flower you call that? That tired one there. That one? That's a xenia. They're all xenias. What'd you take for the little sleepy one? Nothing .. I don't want to sell any. Give you a dime for it. I'd rather keep them if you don't mind, Bill. I'd just as soon wait until they come up a little stronger. Then you can have all you want. See you later, Ira. You know if this keeps up Ira, the neighbors are going to be talking. Let them talk. The more time Flossy spends with me, the less time she has to get into trouble. How about that dandelion wine you're always brewing? The more of that dandelion wine Flossy drinks, the less gin she drinks. You got weird ideas on reform, ain't you. Why do you try to make a pen-knife out of a battle-ax? Sounds kind of foolish to me. God chose foolish things in the world that he might shame those that are wise. And He chose the weak things in the world .. That he might put to shame those that are strong. That's in that bible you got me son. Corinthians, 1. 26. Wait .. I'll show it to you. Quit that singing, will you. - Why? What have you got to sing about? - Can I help it if I feel good. What about? - Everything. Everything. That's Bill. You're stuck on him, ain't you? - He's been good to me, Bill has. Yeah. He ain't sick of you yet. But wait. The first thing that goes wrong, out .. out! You're talking to someone what's had dealings, kid. Dealings. Oh, maybe it won't be that way with me. You don't know your men. I can see that. You'll find out. If Bill does get tired of me I .. I mean if he does .. Maybe he won't. Suppose I get some dough? - That'll be never. Is that so? Say, I cut you in for fifty percent of that summons money, didn't I? How'd you like to come in for fifty percent on another job? A job where your cut will be five grand instead of five bucks. What kind of a job? - That toy factory I was talking about. They fired me, didn't they. Why didn't they fire Ira? He's always asleep on the job. They took bread right from my mouth, didn't they? They owe me something and I'm going to collect. Get this, Bill. They got an old tin-can they call a safe. I know the dump backwards. Every Friday they get in ten grand for the payroll. Which stays in the safe until Saturday noon. It would be a pushover Bill, if you went in with me. Five grand a piece, Bill. What do you say? In the first place, what do I want with five grand? And In the second place if I did want the dough, I'd go out and make it. In the third place, Bragg .. Trina tells me you been hanging around while I've been away. She don't like it. I said I'd speak to you about it. There's only one language you can understand, Bragg. That's it. Bill. Did I hurt? - Not when you don't mean it. What would you do if I really slugged you hard? Bill, you like being with me, don't you? I ain't so nuts about you. You're pretty skinny. Come on, let me go. You ain't tired of me yet, are you? - Let me go I say, before I sock you. Let me .. Oh. Oh Bill. Gosh. He's awful strong. Come on, dish up the grub will you. I'm starving. Yes sir. Hi Floss, how's tricks? Picking up. Here. Flossy .. supper's ready. I'm not hungry thanks, Ira. Hey, what's the idea? What kind of a thing is this? That's a fine thing to pull out of a man's soup. What kind of a mess is this? You're liable to find anything in here. A pair of old shoes or something? Why Bill, that's one of Ira's flowers. You got it for me. I found it in the soup I tell you. - What kind is it? Don't you really know what flower it is? No kidding? Are you dumb. It's a whatchamacallit. It's an Xavier. Xenias. I don't care what kind. It's pretty. Throw it away, it's a measly one. - No. Throw it away, I tell you. I'll get you a bunch of them. Nice big ones. That kind ain't even got a smell. Oh Bill, don't. Now see here, Bill. What's that for? - That's that dime I owe you. I bought a flower from you. What's the matte, can't you remember? I never sold you no flower. - He got it for me, Ira. It's awful pretty. Maybe I'll grow some too, if Bill decides we'll stay here. Don't worry about that. Now I can't have you picking them like this, Bill. Of course, seeing as you got it for Trina. But I have to ask you not to do it no more. Oh, come on Ira. Here, take it. - No. I ain't in the flower business. God never meant for flowers to be sold. Susan said that, and Susan was close to God. She was? Yes, Susan walked hand-in-hand with God all her life. If anybody's with him, she is. Right there in the fold. Right by his side. She led a beautiful life, always a singing of his praises. Basking in his glory. Yeah? When you can make wine out of dandelions. I can believe in it. Come on Ira. My tongue is hanging out. I guess it's alright about the flowers. [ Train whistle ] [ Train whistle ] Some more, Bill? No, I ain't hungry. What do you keep this thing closed all the time for? I thought it might rain or something. Supposing it does rain? Rain won't hurt you. It's good for you. It makes you grow. Open it up. Bill. What do you always keep looking through that hole for? Why? When you're dead you get a hunk of earth. When you're alive you want to hang on to your hunk of blue. It's all I got in the world. That's all anybody's got is that hunk of blue. Bill, what Ira said .. - What? I've been thinking that .. There couldn't be any heaven much better than this, could there? I mean when it's quiet all round and we're close like now. You know, I never noticed it before, but your eyes are sky-colored, sort of .. You got a hunk of blue in each little glim, ain't you. But that don't stop me from clouting you on the chin any minute. Climb in here. You're alright. You're a swell kid, I like you plenty. Do you Bill? - Hmm. But don't get to figuring on that too much. Because how much I like a woman ain't nothing to bet money on. I'm liable to all steamed up about you today and washed up tomorrow. I've been tangled up with women before. Yeah. I guess you must have known lots of women. Nicer ones too, I'll bet. Bigger and fatter, huh? Fatter, yeah. But not nicer. You ain't so bad. You know, a little more meat on you and you'd be lots of woman. You're okay. You suit me fine now. Do I Bill? - Hmm. But maybe you won't tomorrow, see. So you got to kind-of watch yourself on that account. Don't get yourself in too deep. But what if you do sometime and you can't help it? What then? That's the way it goes. Just got to learn to take it and laugh it off. You mean Bill that you're going to ..? You said I'd have to take it. No .. not you. I don't mean you. I mean anybody. Anybody that gets it. Well. No, I don't mean you .. yet. But I'm apt to hand it to you any day. Who knows? Suppose I wake up some morning with a taste like wet hen-feathers in my mouth? You know, women don't look so good on them mornings. I'm apt to give you a push in the face, and take a stroll for myself, as not to. Maybe that won't be right away. I mean, not tomorrow or quite so soon, huh? You can't tell. Never know how a day's going to feel. Just wake up some morning like I told you, and there he goes. But all men don't do that. No, but then it don't feel like it. Or maybe they just can't get away. - Why can't they? A guy can have a lot of reasons. [ Train whistle ] [ Train whistle ] Bill. You like babies, don't you? What's the difference whether I like them or not? It makes a big difference if you didn't. Why? Because you're going to have one. I've known it for a long time now and I .. I thought I'd be afraid to tell you, but now I'm afraid of nothing. Oh please Bill, don't say nothing until I finish. I want you to know something. That's your baby and it's mine. Don't worry, I will take all the blame for it. I didn't mean to tell you it all, but pretty soon you'd know it anyway. It's just too grand and wonderful to keep to myself. You can't understand it Bill, you're a man. Please Bill. You needn't look at me that way, darling. I ain't afraid of you. I've changed a lot. Only a little while ago, I was all alone. And then you came along and there was two of us, and now there's three of us. You can never leave me now Bill, never. Even if you go away, I've got you now. No matter where you go or what you do, I've got you Bill. You're permanent. [ Train whistle ] [ Train whistle ] Here. It looks alright. I was just over the shack. Flossy told me I'd find you here. I had to do the shopping for tomorrow's supper. Whose supper? - Yours. How'd you know I'll be here? In case you are. Suppose I don't show up tomorrow? Tomorrow or ever? Well I .. I guess I'd just be lonesome, like I was before I met you. But it won't be the same exactly. You see, I've got something to look forward too now. Yeah, I'll say you have. I'll never be lonesome when my son comes. How'd you know it will be a son? - I prayed for a son. But you don't believe in that stuff. - Sure I do. You told me you didn't. - I lied. I was afraid you'd be sore at me. I guess you're sore now though, ain't you? Why should I be? It's your funeral. Sure, it's my funeral. But I'm going to stand on my own two feet now. I will bring my son into the world and take care of him and love him always. I suppose as far as I'm concerned .. - And you too, always. That goes without saying. But you're a free man Bill. As free as a bird, remember that. - I'll remember it. Whom God have joined together, let no man put asunder. That's it I guess. It would have looked better Ira, if you wasn't packing that heater. Oh .. I'm sorry. I was on my way to work when Bill came and asked me to perform the ceremony. Of course it ain't a church. But the words are the same, no matter who says them. And in the eyes of God, you are man .. and .. wife. Man .. and .. wife. Thank you for the dress, Ira. I'll bring it back in the morning. No, Trina. You keep it. You look just like Susan looked when she wore that dress .. forty years ago. It's .. laid in my trunk a long time. I guess it ain't much use now. It's so old-fashioned, but .. It .. it sort of suits you, Trina. We'll call it a wedding present. Well, I've got to go now. Hey, come on, come on, come on. Get up, Bragg. What is it? - Now listen. I got to scram out of here right away, see. Tonight. But I can't go unless I leave some dough behind. Enough to take care of someone. A couple of people. Yeah, for a long time. I got to have plenty of dough, see. I ain't got a dime, Bill. Not a dime. - No, but you know where to get it. Oh .. Come on, come on. Get out of it. What did I tell you? You can open it with a nail file. [ Loud whistling noises ] Look at this gadget. I'll wind him up and see what he does. What are we here for? To kick in this door, or play with toys? Come on. [ Whistling ] Here, give me that. - You want to wake up the old geezer? If this wakes him up, what you think will happen when you blow that safe? He's locked in his office, ain't he. By the time he gets here, we'll be gone. Now put that thing back and give me a hand. If he wakes up, we'll be in a tough spot without a gun or anything. I still think you ought to go and tap him on the head like I told you to. I'd feel a lot better if he was gagged and tied up. Nah, Ira wouldn't hurt a fly. Just the same, you'd better go and open that window. So? We're 3 stories up, ain't we? There's a fire-escape. Boy, it sure is a swell night out. Look. You can see the whole river from here. The old moon sure looks slick in that water. I think maybe when I blow out of here, I'll hit the waves instead of the rails. Maybe on a freighter. You ever get the smell of those ships that come in from China and them places? I wonder what little old Whoosis is doing. I think I'll take this thing home to her. She can give it to the kid. She ought to get by okay now with that dough I'm going to give her. Hey, how are you coming there, Goofus? - Give me sixty seconds. [ Whistling noise ] Look out! Yeah, it's me. Me. For a guy that reads bibles and raises posies you shoot straight, don't you. You son-of-a-bitch. You may have killed me! Serve you right if I did! Someone should teach you a lesson. Young squirt going around robbing places. Yeah, it is kind of a low-down business at that, ain't it. Maybe if you needed the dough like I did, you wouldn't be particular. Who was that fellow with you? The one that got away? Don't remember the name. Never saw him before tonight. You might as well hand over that gun peaceful, and surrender. I'll see that the law deals easy with you. They ain't going to deal with me at all. What did you expect to find in there if you did get it open? Apples. - Lemons, more likely. You wouldn't find any money in there. Not in that old cracker-box. If it was the payroll money you wanted, it's in the safe in the other office. You know the combination? If I did I wouldn't say. If I shove this gun down your gullet? - Go on, try it! If you've guts enough to kill a man in cold blood, I've guts enough to take it. Yes, I guess you have at that. You're alright. I wouldn't hurt you. If I knocked you over, what would become of all them posies? Well, what's the matter with you, Pop? What you looking so sour about? Are you disappointed in me? - No. It's not you I'm thinking of. I'm thinking of your wife. Huh? Your wife, Trina. Oh. What's that? What is that? - Somebody set off the burglar alarm. There'll be Police all over the place in five minutes. What are you waiting for? Go on. Get going. The cops will be here in a few minutes. Trina. What do you want? - I got news for you. Bad news. It's about Bill. He's in trouble. Come on in. I don't want nobody to hear but you. What is it? What is it, Bragg? Your boyfriend got nabbed robbing the safe at the toy factory. They caught him with the goods. - Oh no, you're joking. Bill wouldn't do a thing like that. Bill's no thief. That's it. Stepping out of his class. That's why he got caught. And he got shot too, trying to get away. Wait a minute, honey. Don't get upset. That ain't all I got to tell you. You haven't got nothing to be worried about. He may go up the river for a spell, but .. I'll still be around. I'll always be around baby to take care of you. Let me out of here. No! Sure .. There's no hurry. I'll be here. Only with Bill in the jug, you're going to need a man around. You might as well forget Bill for a while. He's gone, ain't he? I tell you he's gone. You're a liar Bragg, he ain't gone. Bill just got home. I seen him go into the shack just a few minutes ago. Bill. Bill. Oh, Bill. Bill. - Get away. That was mighty decent of you, Bragg. To offer to take care of Trina. I didn't think it was in you. Well, she's a helpless little thing. The sort that needs looking after by a man. Sure. What's the matter with Bill? He won't be around. Didn't he get caught? He got away didn't he? For how long? The cops will be down here after him. How do you know? I got a hunch. It's nothing I tell you. Just grazed me a little, cut a little meat off. What's eating you? You'd think you got drilled instead of me. I wish it was. Oh, why did you do it, Bill? Why? I couldn't leave you high and dry, could I. That dough would have taken care of you swell, but I flopped. I'm glad you did. I wouldn't take the money anyway. I'd have given it back. How did you expect to get along? It takes money to have a kid, don't it? For a strong man, you're awful afraid of a little thing that ain't even born yet. Goodness, Bill. If I knew it would scare you that much, I'd never have told you. I'd have just gone away myself some place. I didn't know you were such a coward, darling. A coward? Afraid of a baby. Why, it's the most natural thing in the world, you big fool. They're born all the time and .. If they happen to be man-kids, they just never grow up. They just keep reaching for the clouds and .. Listening to train-whistles. There. How's that? Bill. You know that song that goes .. "A fish got to swim, a bird got to fly." You big silly. Robbing a safe when you always said you had no use for money. It wasn't for me. - For me, I know. But I don't need it. I don't need anything. I don't even need you, Bill. It ain't as if you ever said you loved me. You never did, and I don't blame you. I know what I've done to you, Bill. I've .. I've pulled you down and messed up your plans but I didn't mean to. Honest I didn't. You can go sweetheart, and stay away as long as you like. Maybe someday you'll come back. Not for good, I don't mean. Just for a visit, sort of .. You may get lonesome. Curious, and wanting to know what your son looks like. Gosh. Even birds can't fly all the time. They get .. Tired and have to come home. So they nest safely. Sweetheart. Sweetheart, please. Please, Bill. Bill, I'll do anything. Bill, please, I want you to be happy darling, I want to you to feel right. Bill, Bill, I'll do anything. I'll even give up the kid if you'll only be happy. Oh darling. Pardon me. Bragg tells me that you took Ira's gun away from him. Better give it to me. - What for? Well, if the cops come down here and find that gat on you. It may come under the heading: "damaging evidence". What makes you think the cops will be here? I've got some inside information from a stool-pigeon friend of mine. Give me that gun. Now, Mr Bindlestiff. Your flight's waiting. You'd better hop aboard. What for? You've got to go before the cops come. - No. I'm sticking around. Bragg tells me that you did this job to get the dough for Trina. So that you could get away. And now when sticking around here means the big house, you want to linger? That don't make no sense. Maybe it don't. But I ain't going to leave little old Whoosis. Why, you poor sap. Why don't you take her with you? You never thought of that? No. You'd better not stop to pack. Well? I convinced him. He's hopping on the next freight out. - Good. Trina goes with him. - Oh she does, huh? I didn't say anything about her going. No. That was my idea. Well he ain't going to get away with it. I got the goods on Bill. They'll pick them up before they leave the camp. The both of them. Not unless you squawk, Bragg. Well, I'm going to squawk. For the good of the camp, I'm going to squawk. We don't want that kind of guy around here. He'll always bring cops around. He's a criminal, he is. And I'm thinking of that poor girl. What kind of a life would she lead, with a mug like Bill? I'm going right out now and tell them. You ain't going to squawk. For the simple reason. Stiffs don't squawk. Flossy, don't point that at me. You're drunk. If somebody was to search the whole country. The whole world. They couldn't find two more useless .. More no-good people, than you and me. You wouldn't commit murder. 0h .. this ain't murder. This is just house-cleaning. Now, now Bragg. Stop your shaking. It won't hurt. You'll be where you belong and .. me. Flossy. I'll certainly miss it. It was a beautiful stove. You can always get another one on the instalment plan. A better one too. August, September, October, November. December. December, Whoosis?. A perfect Christmas present, huh, Bill? [ Train whistle ] Bill. Oh, you don't have to be afraid of that no more, Whoosis. (Ro_s)
