Lieutenant, it's going down. All units on TAC three, hold your positions. Nobody goes till we give the word. Unit 2, copy. - Unit 4, copy. Three, did you copy? Copy. I have this covered. They've triggered the silent alarm. Car nine is proceeding south on Main. Okay, stay put. Let the call go out. If they pick it up, we've got it. Any available unit respond to a silent alarm at jewelry store, 863 North Mill. Car nine to control. Nine, go ahead. Yeah, car nine. We're clear of our investigation on third. Yeah, and we'll take burglary alarm on North Mill. We've got it all to ourselves. Okay, nine got the call. Move into positions. Unit 4, we got 'em. - Give 'em plenty of room. Unit 2, move out. Car nine rolling out. Take 'em now. Police! Don't move! Don't move! God! It's them. For God's sake, hang in. You're under arrest for burglary. Cold out this mornin', isn't it? Read him his rights. Great. Thank you. Buh-bye. Don't you know that people are not supposed to work on Saturdays? It's Saturday? - If they don't have to.? Want your coffee in a cup or you want it on those papers? Sorry. You know, a girl's feelings could get hurt if she thought her husband cared more about his job than he did about her. You know, some jobs just cannot be put into neat little compartments. I've heard the rumor. You leave me no choice but to ravage you. No. I hope it isn't what I think it is. Hello. - Captain Hamilton, please. Hello. - Captain Hamilton. The chief wants to see you immediately. I'm on my way. I'm on my way. Sorry. Janet, hon, hold it, take a look at this. What do you think? Well, what do you think? I know as much about naval architecture as you do about aggravated assault. Well, when you get back, let's work on aggravated assault, okay? You're on. To put it bluntly, Captain... Southeast is a disaster zone. I want it put back in order, and you're my candidate. What, do I have a choice? - No. What does Ernie Holland have to say about being pulled off his command? I didn't ask. This is past the point of worrying about Ernie's feelings. He lost control of the station. Ernie is a good cop. He looks out for his men. - Well, that's the problem. Ernie wound up looking after his men and not looking at his men. You give a police officer authority he damn well better know how to use it and respect it. A captain can't be everybody's pal, you know that. And you better not forget it or you'll drown, too. I don't want the job, Chief. I just have the north-central precinct running the way I want it. Of course, you don't want the job you're an intelligent human being. I've earned the right to enjoy my accomplishments. That's what I keep tellin' myself. Where do I start? Well... you're gonna transfer some officers fire some. And you're gonna put some more in jail. Now, hopefully... that'll give the good ones their dignity back. I want you to begin with the night watch. If anybody gets in the way of what you have to do I'm a phone call away. Now if you'll excuse me... I've got to tell the press we've got some crooks in our department. I didn't take somebody's spot in here, did I? Not that I know of. Did you just transfer in? - Yeah, from Meadowbrook. Finally decided, after two years it's time to go where the action is. And from what I hear, this is the place. Well, I'm new here myself.? But, this is the place. You know, it's funny. Now that I'm here. I'm feelin' a little intimidated. I know the felling. And listen, if it gets too rough you got one person to talk to. So do you. - Okay. Howdy. Can you tell me where the locker room is? End of the hall, to the right. Did you know who that was? Somethin' I can do for you, little lady? Yes, you can. First, you never let anybody through there without seeing this. Second, get you feet off that desk and keep 'em off. And third, leave your off-duty homework at home. Do you read me? - Yes, Sir. Ma'am. Good. This time you keep your stripes. Now, where's the captain's office? Upstairs. Get a tie. Come in. Your replacement, Captain Hamilton, is here, Sir. Janet. - Ernie. Come on in. - Thank you. Will you be needing me anymore today, Sir? No, Sal, that'll be it. Thanks for everything. - Yeah. We'll be in touch, buddy? - Right. I'm glad you got here before I left. I wanted to personally tell you, this isn't a bad command. Two guys went sour, but there's two hundred more that are working their butts off in that sewer out there. And I just wish I were staying to keep the barracudas off their backs. Did you have any idea that Dolby and Ginelli would go that far? Hell, no. I thought there were top of the line. I couldn't believe it when I got the call last night. How can you be sure there aren't more? I can't be that blind. Well, I'll make sure nobody takes a fall who doesn't deserve it. Wendy, what are you doing here? You used to like to see me here. Look, he asked me to keep you company. He's gonna be a while. Alright! I'm Captain Hamilton. I gathered from the whistles that I already have some admirers. Would you like to step forward and identify yourselves? No? Last chance. Good. Then it won't happen again. Lieutenant. Move you watch out for full inspection. Yes, Captain. Alright, inspection. Form ranks in the parking lot. - Move it!! I'm out of here. Where's Lieutenant Wilson? Out. Sergeant Jackson in the hot seat at the moment. What can I do for you, Captain? You and your people are invited to night-watch inspection. Come on, vice squad... on the double. Okay, you heard the captain. Let's go. Come on, let's move it. Well, T-shirt has some charm. I think you could use some shoelaces in case you ever have to run. Haircut. Straighten your hat. Tie, Sir. Haircut. Shirt. Hat. Tie, Sir. Got a little attitude problem here? Stand up straight, please. Lose your hat, officer? Haircut. Good ironing job, officer. Thank you, Captain. Step forward, please. Present your weapon. Good. Feeling more comfortable, Hansen? Fine. - Step back, please. Badge needs polishing. Step forward. Present your weapon. This is unauthorized and possibly defective ammo. Get rid of it, mister. Step back. I assume you've picked up your check for your uniform allowance. Would you like to give the city a refund or buy a new blue suit? No, I'm-I'm pressed for time, Captain. Don't have time for fairy tales, officer. Get it done tomorrow, Captain. - Good. I know all of you are angry. And some of you are bitter... about what's happened to this station in the last 24 hours. I could start off by playing to that by telling you that I know you lost a good captain... that 99% of you are good cops... that with small effort we could turn this into a model station. But I'm not used to seeing cops in the felony section downtown being booked for burglary. I'm proud to be a cop. And I want you all to be proud again... as proud as you were when you first pinned on those badges... before you knew how ugly it could get. How does a station like this happen? How do a Dolby and Ginelli happen? How many more are there? Sooner or later, I'm going to find out. And the best way is with your help. So, my door will always be open. I have a private line on my phone. And I will even put up a suggestion box in the report room. Dismiss your men, Lieutenant. Make sure we all have copies of the inspection report. Yes, Sir. Watch dismissed. Captain. Ken... Fraker. We met a few years ago on that, barricaded hostage incident. Yes. Yes, yeah, you put the calm hand on that SWAT sergeant. Mortar fire would have been overdoing it, just a tad. I'm running your detective division these days. And... I, would like to say that you are still the prettiest law officer I have ever seen um, if that's permitted. Just this once, Lieutenant. Looks like your kicking the command off with a bang. Any objections, Fraker? They may be unloading Ernie Holland but it didn't start with him and it won't end with him. Holland made mistakes and he also covered up a lot of other people's mistakes. That's why I brought a shovel. So you've already got all the answers. No. But I will.. Um... good luck. Come on, knock it off, Wendy. Hey, you really are uptight tonight. Look, maybe later? Maybe I won't be around later. You'll always be around. Sometimes I think you came with the city charter. Cops are all alike. Whenever they're tee'd off at the brass they take it out on the street whore. Well, I'm not a street whore. Wendy, will you shut up? I'm... Well, you got things to talk about. I'm gettin' out of here. - Yeah, that's a good idea. Well, what are you waiting for? Nothing. See you later, Alan. Yeah, sure. Put out the damn headlights, will you? Car seven, unknown trouble at 6519 Main Street. Tend to the call. Go to... Can you believe that? Unauthorized, possibly defective ammunition. I could take down a friggin elephant with what I got in my belt here. Maybe you should have told the captain that. I wouldn't tell her if the police station was on fire. You're lucky you got me, Hansen. I'm going to, hold you hand walking through this neon jungle and you're gonna be alright. I'm with you on that one, partner. Yeah? You just stay away from that captain. They're all the same, they're bucking for promotion. Your friends are out in the prowl cars, do not second guess who you back at the station. You understand? Give me that back, man! Here. Go get it. - I said, gimme that. I see you have some gang activity out here. No, you do, Captain. I work vice. My idea would be just to bulldoze 'em to a large sculpture. Well, like you said, you work vice so let's talk about your problems. Starting with Zone 3. You've been doing your homework. We call it the sewer. Ten square blocks of human garbage mixed in with the people who just want to work and stay alive. Now, Main Street, that's the exclusive province of the transsexuals. They carve it up? - You bet. Daven Boulevard, that's the gay hookers and girls who started out as girls pretty much have all of second. Which did you want to see first, Captain? I think I'll let you make the choice, Sergeant. Here's somebody you gotta meet. Hey, Paige. How you doing? Where you been? I've been working. You know that. Where's Karen? She's still working. Want you to meet my new partner. This is, Todd Hansen. This is Paige O'Brien. Hi. - Hi, welcome to the precinct. Right. I hate to break things up here, but we gotta go save lives. You, tell Karen that I'll see her later, alright? Sure thing. Well, what do you think? She's a hooker. I know she's a hooker. She's a good hooker. You don't have hookers in Meadowbrook? We got hookers in Meadowbrook. We arrest them. How long do they stay in jail? Maybe a couple of hours? Couple of hours. - Then why waste your time? Bedside's, these girls, they're very grateful to us for being so understanding. Anything wrong with that? I don't know. Well, you better decide because I don't want to be out of sync with you if we get into some sort of crunch. Stokowski, you can count on me. I want you to be able to count on me, too, partner. Word gets out you're squeamish, nobody is gonna wanna work with you. Mutual trust, that's what makes the whole thing work. You've been living in a cocoon, Hansen. I'm gonna turn you into a butterfly. I'm having a little trouble getting a reading on you, Jackson. Is Lieutenant Wilson in the precinct tonight or isn't he? Well, Captain, the officer in charge hasn't exactly told me where he's gonna be or what he's gonna be doing. And I don't ask. What if you had to get him in a hurry? Find him somehow. Car sixteen and any other unit able to assist a possible major 1050 at Collins and North Mill Street. Roll on that, Sergeant. Get, get... Get back. Everybody, just get, get in the back! You cannot get away with my wallet and my ID! He's making it up! It happens all the time. What do you got? Seems like the marine might have been set up in the back room. He went nuts when he found out. You ought to book the guy that owns this club and turn the marine loose. You hold it down. You, be quiet. I'm a citizen, I got rights. You have the right to remain silent. That's what they say to people when they arrest them. You're inciting a riot. Now I'll do whatever I have to do to protect my men. Like what? Like asking you to leave the scene so we can do our job without anybody getting hurt. Okay? - Okay. You're sure, because I wouldn't want any trouble. Now, do I have your word? Yeah. Now let go. God. Come on. - What's happened to you? Look at these guys. Another party night at the common? So what are you gonna do about the little creep that took my wallet? Look, I didn't do nothing! Alright, alright, alright. Hold on and hold it down. Take 'em both in and we'll sort it out at the station. Let's go, folks, the party is over. Let's go, let's go. - Thank you very much, thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Get in. Thank you, Sergeant. - Where to now, Captain? I still wanna see Lieutenant Wilson. Tom. - Hey, Janet. Yeah. Nice bar. This place is like an oasis in this precinct. Yeah, well, Sergeant Jackson was just showing me the sights. Ugly, isn't it? Like I said, it's an oasis. We have to have someplace like this or we'd all go psycho. They don't care out there, Janet. They live in an outhouse, they don't even wanna move. Let me get you a drink. Captain Hamilton, this is Duke. Nice to meet you, Captain. What'll you have? Well, Duke, what would it cost to buy a drink for all the officers in the bar? For you, Captain, 20 bucks. Well, set 'em up 'cause it's the last drink any cop in this precinct is gonna have in this bar. This place is off limits, I'll put it in writing in the morning. Just got a call from the watch commander. They found Al Benson up in the hills cut in half by a shotgun. Chief, the manpower necessary on a case like this is too much for southeast to cope with alone. And if Downtown handles this case. Internal Affairs will be more able to coordinate. Besides, if we keep it within the precinct, it's only gonna provoke allegations of a cover-up. I don't care what it provokes. This investigation should stay home for the dignity and the morale of the personnel. A police sergeant is dead, that's all we know so far. First priority is to find the killer. It's yours, Lieutenant. - Yes, Sir. I'll be in touch, regularly. Let's have a look. Never seen a dead cop, Hansen? No. I mean, I know it happens but... It happens when a cop forgets that all that's keeping him alive is, his fellow cops. They know yet what took him down? Shotgun, twelve gauge, magnum load. I guess we have about 2000 of that kind in the department. What's happening with Dolby and Ginelli? They're stonewalling.. They're getting ready to make bail. You know, Chief, you're right. This is big. I-it's a disaster zone. I don't know how we're gonna pull it all back together. Well, people like us have to make a choice somewhere along the line, Janet. I think it happens the first time we take on more than we think we can possibly handle. You ever read Milton? "It's better to reign in hell than serve in heaven." Easy for him to say. Hello, beautiful. Thank you for waiting up. Well, I didn't do a very good job, I'm afraid. Did you see the news? - No. What did I miss? We lost a man tonight. Found him with his gun holster, tire tracks behind him. I think he knew whoever. That's some precinct you inherited. Dead cop, crooked cops. I tell you, it's a nightmare. Why don't you try to forget it for a few hours? John... I don't know where to start. I mean, I know where to start because I started. Come on, come on, let's go to bed. Today at roll call, I looked into the faces of 40 cops and all I got back was... vacant stares. Okay... look at me. I never thought I could feel so alone amongst people who wear the same badge I do. Janet, you're not alone now. Really? - That's right. Eyes clear and alert. Relatively alert. - Yeah. As loyal as they come. - That's true. And so, what more could a girl possibly need? Come. Lieutenant Wilson is here as you instructed, Captain. I see that Sergeant Benson's supervised both Dolby and Ginelli. We're gonna need the strongest supervisor we can find to replace him. Anyone you can recommend? I'm sure there are a lot of good candidates in the precinct, Captain. I might also mention that, while they were being supervised by Sergeant Benson, Dolby and Ginelli, turned in the best burglary recap on the watch. I noticed that. What does that make them, Sergeant? Good policemen or good burglars? That's a good question. I read the, altercation report from last night. You, sure got that guy's attention. Send in Lieutenant Wilson, will you? Yes, Ma'am. Lieutenant. Put your personnel file up against this precinct's performance. And I'm not too impressed, Lieutenant. I'm the vice OIC, not the CO. You sat in for Ernie Holland... on days off, vacation, when he was doing committee time downtown, didn't you? I did, but... - But that's all you did. Sat. "Off-hour inspections, none." "Uniform inspections, none." "Supervisor's meetings, none." "Rating reports, personnel reviews, training sessions," zip. All behind schedule or nonexistent. You didn't lift a finger to help him run this precinct. I did the very best job I could. I only have 15 men to hold back a tidal wave. You saw the sewer. What do you expect from a sewer, miracles? Did you ever ask for help? Did you ever come up with one fresh idea to clean up this sewer? You seem to have made up your mind about me, Captain. I don't think I can be useful to you in vice any longer. No way. No way, Wilson. You do not get off that easy. You will run the vice squad or I will run you out of the department. Now, you want more men, fine, I will get you more men. But it will every screw-up, every misfit, every malingerer in this precinct. And if any of them are thieves, you better by God find out. And if things don't turn out for the better, it's very simple. I will bury all my problems in one place. Do I make myself clear, Lieutenant? Did you, did you know his father is a retired policeman? His grandfather was a Medal-of-Valor winner. I read his file, Sergeant Ruby. Cheer up, it's almost lunchtime. Look at this precinct. It looks hopeless. - It is hopeless. That's why you don't sweat the nickel-dime stuff. That's not what they told us at the academy. If they told you the truth at the academy, everybody'd quit. That's better. Yo! Karen, I missed you last night. Sorry. I guess I've to make it up to you tonight, Stan. This is my partner. - Hi. Hi. Hi Todd. Hi. I... I think, that junior is ready for the campground. Think he's got enough seasoning? He will after he's been there. Where's the campground? The campground is in the forest. Captain, we wanted to say thanks for your help last night. Well, we all wear the same badge. Which brings me to the next subject. You think it would look bad in my package if I put in for a transfer now? You have a fine record here. That reputation will follow you wherever you go. What about you? - I think I'd like to stay. See Sergeant Ruby. I've already talked to the captain. Thanks, Sergeant. This place doesn't have the best name. Got to expect a few. That makes 40 of them. They've been coming in all day. I guess you better figure out what you're gonna say at roll call tomorrow. What can I say? They're entitled to put in for transfers. I'm obligated to process them. I'd think twice about approving them. Those transfers include some of the best officers at the precinct. Without them, you're never gonna turn this place around. Why don't you take a look at them, Sergeant? Make sure the Ts are crossed and the Is are dotted. Anything I don't like gets kicked back? They'll have to resubmit. That's the way it should be done. But take your time. Be thorough. By the way, I didn't notice yours in there. I, I have an affinity for sinking ships. Captain Hamilton here. Watch your back. Captains get killed, too. She's got a blowtorch. And believe me, I'm no Joan of Arc! And if I go under, I'm not going alone. Because she's also of the opinion that every one of you turkeys belong in some other profession. Glad you could make it. Thank you, Lieutenant. Now, I'm not about to drop 15 years towards a pension. So everyone of you better walk straight and stand tall. Captain says that we are a bunch of monkeys in a monkey cage. And everyone knows that there's no place for a shed and a bed in a monkey cage. Now let's get them the hell out of here. Come on, pick 'em up. You, you, you and you. Jackson, you're in charge. Thank you, Lieutenant. You're doing fine. Looking sharp. That's it. Matter of fact, it's amazing to see you carrying this couch and this bed rather than lying in it. That's it. Monkey cage? Come on, come on. Let's go. Sergeant? - Yes, Ma'am. I need to see Lieutenant Fraker. I'll get him for you right away. Hello, Captain. My turn in the barrel? - No. I wanted an update on your investigation into Sergeant Benson's homicide. Well, we've done a-a thorough background on Alan, coupled with a locker search and a search of his residence. Neither search turned up anything. You know, I was at the Last Call Bar the other night. Can you find out who owns it? I know who owns the Last Call. Paul Nahid. He owns that, plus a couple of skin joints, porno bookstores. A sleaze like him figures it may buy him a break later on if he, pops for a policeman's booze now and then. Has it bought him any breaks? - I don't think so. But if you want me to, I'll find out. Has Nahid got a record? Well, we've never had an occasion to investigate him here at Southeast Precinct, but I've heard that he beat a couple of narco busts in other jurisdictions. Lieutenant Wilson drank in his bar. Now, if that's all there is to it, that's fine, but... if the relationship goes any deeper... I've gotta know about it. Okay. You got it, Captain. I can't leave Alan Benson's death at locker searches and background checks. He was murdered when two cops were arrested for burglary and they have been hanging tough ever since. I want the people who shut up Alan Benson and I want the burglars, all of them. That clear enough, Lieutenant? - Loud and clear, Captain. Take it easy, Lieutenant? Kenny Fraker seems to know the Southeast very well. He should. He's been here five years. But not well enough to know which burglars in the precinct were wearing badges. Pull his file for me, too, will you? Maybe you'd like to take a look at my file while you're at it. I've already seen yours. Give us a shot here. Come on. When's your trial date? - Out of the way, please. We have no statement. - Look this way. Look this way. - Please excuse us. You've gotta give us some information. When is the trail, Sir? Maybe we ought to swing by the campground tonight. Forget the damn campground. Look around. Look at this way. I just need one more. Just one more. Come on, guys. Give us a break, will you? So this is the campground? In all its glory. Guess I'm bringing you along a little too fast. I mean, faster than you deserve, but... What the hell, I'm, I'm a nice guy. Must be five cars from the watch. Does everybody come up here? - No. It's an exclusive club. Will you just have a drink and stop worrying? Try to relax. You're one of us now. I know you'll drink to that. Take it. Yeah. Over here. I thought we'd get here too late for the party. Hey, Wendy, the party don't start until you show up. Here's your girl. I hardly know her. She's here, junior, 'cause you're here. How you doing? How you doing? I need that. Hey. Hi, baby. Hello, Todd. What am I supposed to say? How's tricks? Look, I'm only here to enjoy myself, just like you. Only, you don't look like you're having much fun. Well, this is... pretty... pretty overwhelming. I know a quiet place. What do you think? Love conquers all. Look... you're very pretty. I mean... You're beautiful. You don't owe me anything. Like I just said, I'm only here to have fun, too. Third rank, parade rest! Attention. Fourth rank, parade rest. Parade, rest. Okay. Looking a 100% better. Now you put that with a lot of heads-up police work and you just may start to get noticed. Like it or not, we got one hell of a reputation to overcome here. What about our transfers? - Yeah. What's holding them up? I don't know. Glad you asked. I'll have Sergeant Ruby check it out. Dismiss the watch, Lieutenant. Right, Captain. Watch dismissed. I heard. You know, I wouldn't wanna be accused of... stonewalling those transfers. And I wouldn't want Downtown pointing any fingers about sloppy or incomplete paperwork. Then we understand each other. If I may, things do seem to be improving. Troops are looking good. Station's shaping up. Only, it's all cosmetic. They're following orders, but I'm not sure I've given them any real motivation to do aggressive police work. Did you finish, Fraker's report on Paul Nahid? Yeah. Gives Lieutenant Wilson a clean bill of health. Of course. The precinct would be a hell of a lot better off without Paul Nahid. Sergeant... would you like to get out from behind your desk for a while? Where is he? - Right over there. It's the new captain. What the hell does she want? - You don't know? Well, you're always telling me you own the police. Watch your mouth. - I thought you liked it. Over there. Captain Hamilton. - It's the new captain. I've heard so much about you. I didn't drop by to exchange compliments with you, Nahid. Then wh-what is it you want? We found out you sold dope in Los Angeles. We found out you were a pimp in Chicago. Right on. But ever since you've come here, you lead a charmed life. Sure, I'm, I'm rehabilitated. You're in town four years and you bought every sleazy piece of real estate that blights the landscape. And not even an LCB violation, let alone a vice bust. That's right. And you're in my joint now... So show some class. You're here with your hands out, right? Wrong. I'm here to put you out of business. What do you want? What, what are you really after? You cops are all alike. You can't give 'em enough! I'm gonna give you more than you can handle. You can't do it all by yourself. Everyone's invited to this party, Nahid. You're gonna have the fire marshals, the building inspectors, the health department. That's harassment. - No, that's only the beginning. Sergeant, I want uniformed officers outside that front door within the hour. No known hookers, drunks or minors allowed. I assume this includes, all of Mr. Nahid's other establishments as well? Of course. Back... off! No way. And you better make room at the bar for the Liquor Control Board 'cause they're gonna be regulars here. Did I forget anything? We, we could paint the curb red. You're dead in this precinct, and I'm here to bury you personally. Now do you still think I can't do it? Looks like your little league game just ran out of balls. You're going to jail! No. Buzz us through. Book 'em. Welcome. This way, pal. You, too. You know, they're gonna be out on bail in an hour. Don't worry about it, Sergeant. This is our finest hour. I gotta go. - Why? Brad will let you know if you get a call. Nah. - What? What, are you getting bored with me already? Obviously not. - No. Look. I've never had a real relationship with anyone before. Maybe we kind of got one. Paige. God, I like you. You know, I like you so much. But you can still have a real life. You know, how you're living now, it's a dead end. Don't you see that? Why don't you get out? You still have time. It's already too late for me. So just be my friend. And don't judge me too harshly. Okay? Okay. Janet? I was worried about you. You didn't call the office. Why are you home so late? Well, I thought I'd, get home later than you, just once. Well, that's why I brought the files home, so we could be together. Well, I, and your staff thank you equally. John. We've been through times like this before. Not quite. I thought paying dues applied to... the early years. Whose dues are we talking about? Ours. I'm talking... Hello? I need to meet with you, Captain. Who is this? I'm just a cop, but one you need to hear from. The parking structure at Second and Wells. Know it? - Yes, I do. I'll be there in an hour, alone. You do the same. - I'll be there, alone. John... I've gotta go. Janet, I love you more than enough to accept the obvious problem of being married to a cop a long time ago. I can't get used to the fact that I might have a visit from a fellow officer regretfully informing me, but I am not prepared to hear that you have been killed by a fellow officer. John, I worry about you, too. I-I'm afraid you could get killed in a car crash or, or that you'd be injured at work. I mean, that comes with the turf when you love somebody. Your situation is not exactly the same as crossing a street. I'm good at what I do. And you have to trust that my training and my instincts give me the edge. Against whom? Against what? You don't know who the enemy is. What I do know is, if I go out there scared, then I'll lose my edge. I'll be back as soon as I can. Goodnight, John. Goodnight. I thought you said you were coming alone. That's my wife, Captain. She wouldn't let me come alone. Don't shoot, Captain. Can I get out? Come on. What do you got for me? I guess it was seeing you come into the station with those two yesterday. Made me think... things could be turned around. I was gonna quit. Get into real estate. Damn. I used to love the job, love coming to work. You could help. Make the Southeast the kind of place we all wanna come to work in. If you've got anything that can help us clean up this mess... Sergeant Benson... he was behind a lot of it. He'd recruit cops to steal for him, take 'em to the campground, fix them up with hookers through his girlfriend. Who's the girlfriend? - Wendy Prentice. The one you brought in with Nahid. What's the campground? It's a party place down by the river. Benson would meet guys like Dolby and Ginelli down there and take stuff they'd stolen on watch. How many others are involved? Maybe six or eight who do the stealing... maybe ten more like me who know about it. Gotta have the names. Captain, I'd rather blow my brains out than name guys that never did anything to me. I'll tell you this much. I'm almost sure Sergeant Benson was going to meet Wendy Prentice the day he was killed. She doesn't have the strength to handle a 12-gauge magnum load. Don't you think I know that? Go take care of your wife. Wendy Prentice has not been seen at the address she gave booking for the last three days. I want her for questioning in the murder of Sergeant Alan Benson. Anybody finds her, I want immediate notification. You think she pulled the trigger, Captain? I think she knows who did. Sounds like you developed a good source of information, Captain. Let me say this. Some people around here are starting to get their integrity back... remembering what it felt like to be a good cop. Now, Dolby and Ginelli are not gonna stay quiet forever. Like I've said a dozen times before... it would be better if we all took part in the cleanup. Lieutenant. Alright, this is the break we've been looking for. Everybody, take these sheets with you and contact me personally if you turn up anything. Sergeant. Hey, Hansen, how are you doing? You wanna see the captain? She free? She will be in a couple of minutes. Have a seat. What are you doing? You can get splinters in your tail just looking at these desk jockeys. Come on, let's go save lives. Hey, Hansen. Don't you wanna see the captain? No, no, I was just gonna apply for some vacation time. It's okay. You haven't been around long enough for vacation time, Hansen. You're right. Forget it, Sergeant. Come on. Hansen. You have been around too long to play innocent bystander, partner. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we're having a real good time. Come on, you little doggy. Sergeant Jackson, will you mirandize these citizens? Alright, listen up, listen up. The poet Edmund Spenser said it best. "All for love and nothing for reward." Who are you kidding? - Let me explain. We are here to give you back your flesh. Mere money will not buy your flesh here anymore. That is because you now have friends here. Friends who will now be here for you every time. You will leave, but you come back, we will be here. That's a promise. The poet also warns... - Right. "Ay me, how many perils do enfold the righteous man to make him fall?" What's he smoking? - Come on. Tonight we heed that warning. You will no longer be perils. You will no longer enfold the righteous man or woman to make her fall, at least not here. Take you to Minton, to Meadowbrook. Better yet, cross the county line, but not here. Clear? - Yeah. So, ladies and gentlemen, don't be shy. Step right in. There is no waiting for the chariot that bears the human soul to freedom. Let's go. In. Easy, please. There you go. Room for all. Right in here now. And don't forget to tell all your friends about our new service. There you go. Lieutenant Wilson. I don't remember authorizing this. You didn't. I've been trying to get to you all day. This is the first whore sweep in the history of Second Avenue. What do you think? Well, it's not by the book, but it's effective. Come in, five, meet Minton Precinct officers at motel 1620 Eastern, regarding your suspect Wendy Prentice. I gotta roll on that. No. Wendy's dead. We're all dead! - Shh. I've been afraid for four years. Always afraid. What happened, Paige? Come on. Shh. It's alright. What happened four years ago? Wendy helped me. She knew I was a runaway. She... helped me. Well, she, she helped you hook? You still hate that, Todd, don't you? Four years ago, Nahid got ripped off for a load of dope. Wendy knew the four guys who did it. Did Wendy help set those guys up for him? We turned tricks for them. And then left the door open. Went down those wide old stairs, and there they were, coming up. Who, Paige? Can you tell me who? Nahid... Sergeant Benson... and, and another cop. I didn't get a good look at him. But the next day it was in the papers. All those four dudes had been murdered. Wendy told me just to keep quiet, that everything would be alright. Yeah. But that's not true, is it? I'm concerned over what I see as your increased isolation. You haven't called me. You haven't asked Internal Affairs for help. The men at the station don't trust Internal Affairs. They think IA just wants to send cops to prison. Well, some even may have to go to prison. Have you forgotten that? - I'm very aware of that. I told those same men at the station how much I wanted to talk to a prostitute named Wendy Prentice. She wound up strangled in a motel room. You're not to blame for her death. Well, maybe not, but I do believe a policeman killed her. Chief, I am making progress. Some of the men are beginning to come around, but... I need something big to galvanize the station and the community. That hooker roundup was a pretty good start. That's right. It's a start. But if we keep cracking down in bits and pieces, the sleaze are gonna come back. I wanna make a statement that the good guys own the street now and we're not giving it back. What do you have in mind? I'm gonna shut down Zone 3 Friday night using every blue suit and every patrol car that has tires. What a sight that would be. But you can't do it. You'd never get a permit from the Public Board of Works. Too much pressure by local businesses. I know. And I can't condone it. - I know. Why is it I wish we hadn't had this little chat? We didn't. Unit 5, all units in position. Command 5 to all units. Shut 'em down. We, we can't keep them all. No, we'll throw back the little ones. Get off me. - Get off, everyone, out! Get over here! I'm getting out of here. Get off of me! Command Sergeant Jackson. We've got an armed robbery in progress. Two inside a drugstore and one in the car. Zone 1, Fairfield and Seventh. I know you blue suits are busy, so we'll handle this. We stumbled onto this sucker, but we're not stumbling anymore. So you guys look sharp. You're playing with my life. Okay, get ready. Here they come. Here they come. Hold it right there! Don't move, don't move! Don't you move! Turn around! Turn around! Put those weapons down real slow. Slow! Slow! Alright, spread, spread. So we planned it and we did it. Like clockwork? These tactics should put in a textbook and taught at the academy. Well, should we call it, Lessons From The Monkey Cage? I think we can find a better title, Sergeant. Good work. - Thank you. Thank you. Well, Hansen, you see enough action? You bet, Captain. Sergeant Ruby told me you stopped by to see me the other day. He got the impression you wanted to talk. Junior here is turning into quite a policeman, Captain. Yes. I'm counting on that, Stokowski. Yes. Someone to see you, Captain. Come in. The stuff I saw when I first came here... somehow I felt... that when it really mattered, we-we could still be good cops. But... for a policeman and a sergeant to go that far, to go so far... As to be willing to kill to protect his own corruption. And years later, Alan Benson is murdered himself. Maybe by another cop. Did this place called campground... play any part in your relationship with Paige O'Brien? Yes, Captain. Can you tell me about it? So what is it you want? Decided to make a deal? Eight years ago you made a deal with us when you raised your right hand. You broke that oath. I won't make any kind of a deal with you ever. So what are we doing here? Captain Hamilton asked me to invite you in. Chief wants me to lock up the rest of the burglars in town. I could use a little help. Dolby? You're a married man with kids. I know what's going through your mind now and ever since another cop put handcuffs on you. "What happens if I go to prison? What happens if I make a deal?" But the chief just said he wouldn't make a deal. You have two people dead already. One of them was a cop. Now we won't plea-bargain away a cop's murder, not ever. So I go to the pen no matter what. I don't understand what you're saying. I'm saying, this is your last chance to tell the truth, so we can write the kind of report that will tell the judge or jury where your head is finally. Now, we know about the campground. We know Sergeant Alan Benson was the fence. You better take a good hard look at your captain, Chief. She's been smoking something. You walk out of here now, you're a hardcore burglar on your way to prison. You know what they do to cops in prison? They rape 'em, they throw 'em off the top tier. Now, is that what you want? - Let's go, Sam. Good day, Ginelli. I said, let's go. Good day, Ginelli. I never had a real friend until Vince. What's going on? - What the hell? Today I met a thief with a conscience. Five of you burgled property and fenced it off to Sergeant Benson. Another eight of you knew about it and said nothing... which is the same as stealing in my book. When you hear your names called... step forward. You will be relieved of your duties as police officers... pending final investigation and formal board of rights. But I will do everything in my power... to see that none of you ever wear badges again. "Stokowski. "Farpizil. "Callander. "Newman. Peterson. "Michael, Andreas. "Finnemore, Albertson. "O'Brien, Callish. Zydel." Congratulations are in order. Looks like you made a clean sweep. Not quite. It's not over yet. No? You forgot one key item in that report you gave me on Paul Nahid. He was arrested and released as a suspect in a multiple homicide four years ago. Well, I must have overlooked it. But if he was released... You and Benson worked vice together four years ago. Didn't you? - Yeah. Well, we were partners for a tour in vice. I just got the ballistics report on Benson's service revolver. It connects to one of the four men who were murdered. Two more were killed by a .45 we linked to Nahid. And the last victim was killed by a .38 we can't seem to match. I thought maybe... Benson's partner was the best place to start looking. In your holster. It was self-defense. They got heavy. Paul Nahid shot two of them before we knew what was happening. The other two men... went for their guns and... We had no choice. And then things... just got worse. Benson became a thief and you started fencing through Nahid. Benson and the hooker... were the only links to you and Nahid after Dolby and Ginelli were arrested. I guess after you killed Benson... Wendy Prentice was easy. I'll take that gun now. And the badge. I, um... I don't feel very good. I've... I've got to use the bathroom. Put a man front and back in case he decides to leave. Yes, Ma'am. You alright? Janet... it's over. It's like I turned a corner and I ran into a brick wall. One way or another, two people are dead and twelve cops are facing trials or jail. What did you expect? You did what you had to do. You did what they sent you in there for. Come here. I should be tougher inside. Wrong. Colder. - - Harder.. It's not you. It's not why the chief picked you. I think the reason he picked you is 'cause he knew you wouldn't enjoy it. You... You don't give somebody a sledgehammer... who, wouldn't think twice about using it. Hansen, he gave me everything to break the case. Now he's practically tried and convicted by the department he helped. Are you feeling too close to the men? That's what beat Ernie Holland. His humanity. - - You wanna give that up? Okay. There's never too big a price to pay. Why don't you wait for me inside, okay? I, heard you're gonna testify at the boy's trial board today. That's right. You really pulled that station together. You've got the core of a fine precinct now. Don't get hung up on one individual case. Well, Hansen made mistakes. Serious ones. But he faced up to 'em at a hell of a cost to himself. Todd Hansen is what that station is about, a new start. I want him back there. And that's what I'm going to tell the board. Captain showing up at board of rights saying things that rub people the wrong way... could very well be hurting your future promotional opportunities. You mean, I'm gonna have to give all this up and go back to just being a cop? Besides, I thought you stopped betting against me. Old instincts die hard. Good luck, Captain. Officer needs assistance.
