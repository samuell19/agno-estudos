Aye, mamicita, it is hot. Whew! Ah, oui, she is tres hot. Hey, this what we join the French Foreign Legion, to suffocate in petticoats? The corporals who walk, who suffocate, but not the sergeant who rides. I'm not a sergeant, I'm a merchant and you're my daughters. Now, you don't think I'd pull rank on you girls. Bah! Well, how else you going to catch a Riff prisoner for the lieutenant? You think I'm not hot. This beard's killing me. Honest, it hurts me to ride while you walk. But with only one jackass in the crowd. Permit a correction, Sergeant. In this crowd there are four jackasses. Why is it we always get those dirty jobs? What two other Legionnaires could pass for native beauties as well as you. And besides, think of the rewards. Reward! Sure. You get a little better at this sort of thing, you'll both marry a Sheik. Now listen, Mike, for almost two weeks now we have been away from Tarfa, and all the time you make jokes... Hold it. Riffs. How many? I'm not sure, four or five maybe. What tribe? Black stripes. Hussin's boys. Ah, at last. Remember, no shooting. Their pals won't be far away. Sure, Mike, we do it the hard way. Always the hard way with Sergeant Mike. And no rough stuff until they dismount. What if they don't dismount? They'll dismount. You kids have got real sex appeal. Peace, Brother. Peace and Allah's blessing. To what oasis are you bound, old goat? Uh, to Houran, Excellency, with my daughters, to market my humble produce. I think the market will pay higher for your daughters than your produce. Uh! Alas, Excellency, the girls are undeserving of your gentle flattery, for they are as ugly as the bloated she-camel. Ugly? Yes. Can it be that a father speaks the truth about his daughters? Or is it that he is greedy, and would not share his precious doves even with the warriors of the Caid Hussin? Oh, but, Excellency... It was to your daughters I addressed myself. Speak in your own soft voices, pretty ones. Aye, favored one, they cannot speak, for Allah has cursed them both, deaf and mute. Indeed? Yes. Then you do not appreciate your blessings. Eternal silence in a woman is a quality to be highly prized. Take them. Oh, no, sir! Mercy, Master. Aha, torito. Aha. Aha, toro... Torito... Not you, Yussif, I want you to meet Lieutenant Kruger. He's your type. All right, prisoners, back to work. Get out! Come... Mademoiselle De Latour, Lieutenant. My dear. Orderly! There are three prisoners at work in the square below. When they finish their detail, they will be confined to their cells for the duration of their sentences. They have insulted Mademoiselle De Latour. Yes, Lieutenant. But, Cherie, they meant no harm. While you are in Tarfa, you enjoy my protection. I want this clearly understood by my men and by you. I have something to show you! I hope you like it. Oh, Cherie, it's beautiful. Permit me. Sorry, Lieutenant, the Administrator is just entering the building. Why the devil doesn't he notify me in advance of those visits. I regret this, my dear. I understand. Later? Later. Your Honor. Lieutenant Kruger... An aperitif? Permit me to come right to the point, Lieutenant. I had another complaint from a Berber, one of the native merchants. Indeed? You had his caravan searched and confiscated several items, including some valuable gems. It is part of my duty to recover stolen property. The mere fact that merchandise is in the possession of a Berber does not mean it is stolen. I'm afraid I must use my own judgment. Major Berthot left me in full command. That's true, but with orders to cooperate with my efforts to bring peace to this territory. A dead Riff is a peaceful Riff. Mike! Sergeant Mike. Sergeant Mike. Sergeant Mike. Mossul. Why you act as though you didn't expect to see me again. You've been away so long. How's business? Terrible since you went away. Who is she? She's the new dancer at the Oasis. Lieutenant Kruger just confined three men to their cells for seeing less than you saw. Worth it. Find out where she lives. And if she would like to meet you. I've already found that out. Get going. We just get back and already you start trouble with the lieutenant. Another Riff prisoner. You are sabotaging my peace talks with Sheik Ben Allal. That is one of Caid Hussin's men. Even worse. Don't you see, Hussin is boiling for an excuse to attack Tarfa. Hussin attack? Nonsense. He's an ordinary bandit. You are mad. Hussin is a Caid. A Chief. You must leave military matters to me. They have been left to you long enough. Major Berthot and the regiment returns Friday. I shall make a full report of your irresponsible conduct. You are a meddling old fool. We shall see what Major Berthot has to say. Major Berthot is a soldier and I am a soldier. He will understand what I have done here. He will promote me. You are mad, Kruger. Attention. Why the devil did you bring him here for? Your orders, sir. My orders were, Sergeant, to get me a prisoner in a hurry. You've been gone for two weeks. I know you are a great favorite of Major Berthot, but until he comes back, I am in full command here, understand? I understand he'll be back soon, sir. I don't like you, Kincaid, and one day perhaps you might give me the opportunity to deflate you. And now, my little bird, you will sing for me, no? Where is your Caid? Where is he hiding? What are you waiting for, a medal? Get out! Mossul? Yeah? Towel. Pants. How'd you make out? Okay. She lives across the street from the Oasis Cafe. Good boy. Shirt. How do you figure this girl, Mossul, champagne or jewelry? Jewelry seemed appropriate. I... I took the liberty. Allez. Oops. This looks like a real imitation. You must have blown the whole bankroll. Oh, no. Papa Abdul was pleased to sell it at a discount. I have been of some service to him in the past. You should have been a general instead of an orderly. Jacket. This one seems like a nice girl. You going to start that again. Why are you always trying to marry me off? I should like to see you settle down. If I settle down you'll be out of a job. Orderlies are for fighting men. But married men are fighting men. You're a cynical little devil. That's the native in me. I suppose you figure there'll be other dames even if I was married? That's the French in me. Cap. What are you two boys doing here? Waiting for you. Well, you're not the only one, now stand back. Don't do it, Mike. There are other girls. She belongs to the lieutenant. He does not outrank me in there. Now, Mike, we have had many narrow escapes together. We three. Huh. It would only be silly after winning all those fights with the Riffs, to end up by losing to a Legionnaire. Kruger's no Legionnaire. He would not hesitate to shoot you. You've been spending too much time dressed as native woman, you're getting soft. Now listen, Mike, we love you very much. And it you are shot, we are going to be very sad. We will have to put on our dress parade uniforms when the bugler plays taps, we will have to stand at attention, and... And when they carry your poor dead body... We'll... We'll spit right in your eye. Be careful I don't spit right back. Women. Yeah. Women. Women! My name is Mike Kincaid. Mine is Marie De Latour. What kept you, Mike? Two corporals and a lieutenant. You mustn't stay. He comes here often. Not today, baby. He's trying to make a Riff prisoner talk, and they don't talk. My mother's. She'd of wanted a girl like you to have it. I don't think you ever had a mother. It you are depending on Legion regulations to keep me from torturing you, you are very much mistaken. Here, I make the rules. Do you think you can force information from me? You do not even know what goes on in your own camp. What do you mean by that? You, hope to intimidate me, a chieftain of the Caid Hussin? Even your own inferiors defy you. Nobody defies me. Indeed? When I arrived a young woman departed, she is your friend, but when she pleased the sergeant, he didn't hesitate to send his boy to arrange a rendezvous. Orderly. Orderly. Orderly. Come and get it. Oh, Henri! How is the lieutenant? You better worry about the sergeant. The sergeant struck a blow for liberty, eh? How many teeth did the lieutenant lose? Did, he bleed much? You're the lieutenant's wet-nurse, tell us about it. Yes, did he suffer? We will all suffer for this. The lieutenant is in an evil mood. Huh. When isn't he in an evil mood? Yes, Henri, tell us about the lieutenant's moods. Hey, who is making the coffee, a camel? Stop complaining. You're better off than the sergeant and the Riff. I have orders that they are to get nothing. The sergeant is an honored guest here, he is welcome to my breakfast. Anybody's welcome to my breakfast. Better eat it yourself, Londos. You're quite a hero amongst your own kind, Sergeant? Toll me something, Henri, do you really love the lieutenant, or did you marry him for his money? You'll find out soon enough what it means to provoke the lieutenant. He'll have you shot for striking him. Goodbye, you dirty rat. Psst! Mike! Luis! Hurry up. The blood is rushing to my head. Water, salami, tobacco! Good old Luis. Good old Pierre, he is holding me by the feet. Say, Mike, for lunch we bring you a gun. Never mind the gun. I don't want to shoot any Legionnaires. It's the only way, Mike. Hey! Hurry up. The Guards will spot us. Don't you worry. I'll find some way out of this jam. And thanks. Okay, take him up. Here. Well, go on, take it. Allah bless you for a merciful man. And curse you for a treacherous one. You put the lieutenant on my tail. It became necessary that I get him off mine. I regret fate chose me to be the instrument of your downfall. It hasn't hurt your appetite. Your food brings comfort to my last moments, so I shall give you advice to prolong yours. Take the gun your friends offered you and escape. That's just what the lieutenant would like. He'd have me shot without a court-martial. Keep your advice. It's more than advice. It's information. All here in Tarfa are about to die. Caid Hussin attacks at the sinking of tomorrow's sun. Are you crazy? Hussin knows that the regiment is gone. He has acquired new arms, new warriors... He attacks. You telling me this so I can escape? I have nothing else to offer in exchange for your food, and Muhammad has written it is a sin to die with a kindness unrepaid. Muhammad was a wise man. Take the gun, my friend. Thanks, pal, but I don't think I'll need that gun now. But you must save yourself, nothing can save Tarfa. That's what you think. Guard! Guard! I presume you are expecting some reward for bringing me this information? Yes, sir, freedom. Do you think I'd release you? You are a fool. Lieutenant, the regiment will be back in five days. If Hussin's attack can be stalled until then, you've got a chance. I can stall it. And you can also desert. Whoever deserted and got away with it? It would be impossible to delay an attack. Tough, but not impossible. I can annoy Hussin with a diversionary action. Stab his camp, keep his cutthroats busy with hit and run plays. Keep them chasing me for five days. Suicidal. What've I got to lose? You and who else? A dozen men. Can't spare them. You've got seven men rotting in your prisons. They'd go for the same reason I'd go. Free them. Drop the charges against them, give them a chance to be men again. I'll think it over. Lieutenant, you haven't got time to think. If my scheme doesn't work, you've still got a city to defend and only one company of Legionnaires to do it with. You've got civilians to organize, colonists to bring in off the desert... Are you telling me my job? Let's cut out the double-talk, Lieutenant. Nothing means anything to you except your career and your own hide. If Hussin attacks before the regiment gets back, you're through. Orderly. Orderly. Send for the administrator. Sergeant, remember, I'm the one who uncovered this plot. I am the one who is devising your mission and I'm the one who is saving Tarfa. Lieutenant... Yes, sir. Sergeant, take command. Present arms. Ho! Buenos dias, Sergeant. Deserting? When we get back the lieutenant will drop the charges. Just like for the rest of you. They must have loved their sergeant. They've come to join the heroes. Volunteers. Heroes. Volunteers. Okay, boys, break out the bottles! Browning! For the first time since I join the Legion I begin to smell those beer gardens of Berlin. You're close to them, Kurt, old man. Yeah. Just over the horizon there. Not far from the pubs of London. That's where I'm heading, London. Eh, Mouse? Yeah. Paris for me. Paris, eh, Roshko, mon ami? We team up again, my little Mouse. We were the best burglars on the Left Bank, the little Mouse and me. But this time we got to expand. We rob the Right Bank too. Ah, we rob all the banks. My family, before they were slaughtered by the invaders. My father, my mother, my brothers and my sisters. I go back home. I join the army. The invaders come back. I kill. Mmm. Nice looking sister. Hey, leave some of that for me, will you? What for? Tonight we can sneak into Sidi-Abahd, there's plenty of whiskey in town. Sidi-Abahd. Sidi-Abahd. Well, we'll tear the place down. Sidi-Abahd or bust. Sidi-Abahd. - Tonight. Okay boys, your two minutes are up. Remount. Remount? What's the idea, Kincaid? Sergeant to you, Lustig. I don't intend to make this job any tougher than it is, but alcohol is dehydrating and there ain't much water out there. You've all had your last shot of liquor until we got back to Tarfa. Those of us who got back. Pick up your hat, Browning. You too, Kurt. When we hit that desert, the sun'll be murder. You're not much good to us with sunstroke. You'll get your chance to do some killing, Londos, only it'll be here, not home and they won't be your old enemies, they'll be Riffs. But if you don't keep this clean, they'll be killing you instead of you killing them. Now get this straight, all of you. This is a dirty patrol. For as long as it lasts, every move you make, every thought you think, you move and think like Legionnaires. You're really going through with this thing, Sergeant? Just what was it that you had in mind, Jardine? Desertion? Not here in Riff country for one of those special slow deaths they reserve for stray Legionnaires? And you, Sergeant, were you planning for us all to be heroes? I'm planning to hit the Riffs and keep 'em running in circles for five days. I don't care if we do it because we want to be heroes or free men. The main reason we're going to do it is because we have no other choice. There's just one other thing... Each man has got to depend on the next man. I'm going to see to it that the next man doesn't let him down. Okay, you've had your two minutes and I've had mine. Now get back on your horses! Another camp, Sergeant. A fresh one. Still hot. Must have been over a hundred in that bunch. Headed toward the mountains, like the rest of them. It looks like we're on the right track. Suppose there are more of 'em headed this way, behind us? There probably are, Jardine, so let's keep moving. Madre mia. My father's father. Shh. My mother's mother. Quiet. The biggest camp I ever saw. Every mother's son of a Riff. White burneeses, Sheik Ben Allal's boys. We're in the wrong camp. Oh, oh. Black stripes. Hussin's cup-throats. It's the right camp. But I don't understand it. Ben Allal is a cockroach, he talks peace with the French and then he prepares to slaughter them. No, the old boy's always been on the square. Hussin must have sucked him into this somehow. We're onto something bigger than we thought. Look at that black tent, the big one. Extra guards. That means weapons and ammunition. And quite a big pile of it according to my boastful little cell-mate. That's it, boys. Blow up that ammunition dump and we start this job with a bong. End us with a bang, too. Relax, Jardine. I'll only need two men for this job, besides myself. I go. I got the matches. Let's go. You take charge, Corporal, back here. Take me. It I can't kill the fiends who invaded my homeland, I kill Riffs. To me they are all the same. Each one I kill makes sweeter the sleep of my father, my mother, my brothers... And your sisters. I know, Londos. Okay, you're in. Stay! Yesterday, before you pass through here, my steel would have passed through you, but tonight, you of the Sheik Ben Allal have become blood brothers to we of the Caid Hussin. Pass, O brothers. Oh, brother! Abdul, you work too hard. You should take a rest. Why don't you come out to my farm and rest for a couple of weeks. I just got in a new stock of halabal, too. I want you to meet my daughter, she's a beautiful girl. I wish you'd take my daughter. As a matter of fact, I wish you'd take my wife. Well, Abdul, it's time to go. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Yussif. Here are the grenades. Plant them deep, right in the ammunition. Go out the same way we go in, and don't stop running. Without legs? That ain't funny! Who said it was funny. Come on. No wonder they've got this place so heavily guarded. Let's get out of here. Who seeks entry here? Our noble chief, the Caid Hussin. Our venerable Sheik Ben Allal. The big brass. Your father! Your husband-to-be. Wait a minute. A thousand pardons, Mahla, we would have a word with you, my daughter. No! The wedding gown of my mother's mothers. I desire you wear it for the ceremony. Mahla, my daughter, I think you should wear the traditional garments of our own people. By this marriage, our people become as one. I shall wear your gown, Caid. You have one quality I very much admire in a wife, obedience. The hour of the ceremony draws near. I must hurry and dress. So that's what's bringing these two outfits together for the attack. A marriage of state. My father... Does my marriage still distress you? Not your marriage... Your husband. There is no other way. Our two peoples are enemies, when I became his bride, we become as one people, one army. If only that marriage could be delayed four more days. What? When Hussin gets that girl, he also gets her father's fighting men. He can't attack Tarfa without them. I see that you are determined, my daughter. Yes, Father. I cannot hope to persuade our people that you are wrong and I am right. That's it, boys. No girl, no marriage, no attack. I shoot her in the boudoir. Put that thing away. A Legionnaire kill that girl, this mob'd wipe up Tarfa before dawn. But steal her, and every last one of 'em would be busy trying to get her back. Steal a Sheik's daughter? Mike, you know what they'll do to us when they catch us. We'll worry about that when they catch us. Let's go. Not yet, Mike. I want to see her in that bridal gown. Snap out of it. Hey, Mike. I got one, too. Drop her. Legionnaires! Legionnaires! Legionnaires! Legionnaires! Legionnaires! Go on upstream. I'll catch up with you. Eijah, take your men upstream... The rest of you come with me. Eijah, this way. Mouse, get up there and keep your eyes open. Hey, Sarge, the little Mouse gets lonesome without me. All right, go ahead. The rest of you inside. Put the horses up there. Hold the pack horse there, Lustig. Hey, this is very nice. Tres cozy. We can sit tight here for the next four days while the Riff's prowl. Yah. And that little Riff beauty will keep them prowling. You're a smart man, Sergeant. Yeah, until they spot us. What about her, Sarge? Untie her, but don't let her out of your sight. Look at her eyes. Look how she hates. She hates like I hate. Wonderful. You filthy swine. Aha, my little kookooch. She hates just as well with her voice as she does with her eyes. She's a real woman. She hates with everything. Londos, let her alone. Kurt, help Lustig unpack that machine gun. Set it up at the entrance. Hey! That's my baby. I'm the machine gunner. Londos! The girl! Just one more, baby. Grab her, Luis! It's my legs, Sarge, I can't move my legs. What do you think? I don't know. He's hurt pretty bad. See what you've done, woman? You can't blame her for trying to get away. You're right, Mike. It was my fault. I understand your hatred, my little kookooch. It's like mine. I forgive you. I don't want your forgiveness. Riffs! Riffs! How far? Three minutes, maybe four. Now you shall all die. Well, came on. Let's go. You must go, Mike. I'll be all right in here. He's right, Mike, we can double back for him. They won't stop here when they see us. All right, go ahead. Luis, you take care of the girl. We'll get back to you as soon as we can. Sure. Just in case they spot you, there's your baby. I've got your stuff on my horse. Fine. Keep going. Mike, you can't stay here. You're too good a sergeant to... I know. I know. Just wanted to say goodbye. It's too bad you Americans have no word for Au revoir. We do. I'll be seein' you. All right you said it, go ahead. Sarge! Take my rife, and keep it clean. Wait here. I'll see if I can help the sergeant. That's for my father... My mother... My sisters and brothers. Get that machine gun. My father... My mother... I've got to replace my horse. Take the men to the temple ruins. Pierre and I will meet you there tonight. Sure, Mike. Vamanos. Luis, wait. I don't want any more trouble. Keep them away from her. Sure, Mike. He swallowed the bait, Master. They will lead us to Mahla. Follow them, we'll be a mile behind you. If they discover your presence, I'll lighten your heavy feet over a slow fire. Uh-uh. Mustn't touch. I can look, can't I? Sergeant Kincaid will spank. Ever seen one of these native girls dance? Sure, she's not the type. Ah, she's like all the rest. Just a little high and mighty, that's all. Yeah. She needs to be tamed. It would be interesting. Gentlemen, shall we have a little entertainment? I don't know, that corporal is pretty quick on the trigger. I can talk that sap out of his sister. Woman, take your burning eyes off of me. Do you fear they will melt away your false face? What is false about my face? All of it, even to the last hair of your moustache. Do not provoke me, woman, I will not tolerate any ridicule about my moustache. How do you keep it fastened to your unclean flesh? With camel grease? You think it's false, huh? Do you ask me to believe that it's real? Woman, if you can pull my moustache from my face, I will set you free. Go ahead, woman. Very thoughtful of you. All tied up for us. I should have known you dirty, stinking... Sarge, we were just trying to catch her for you. She beamed Luis and made a break for it. I gave orders for her to be let alone. What's the matter, Sarge, you afraid of a little competition? Mike, wait. It was my fault, Mike. Mamacita, what a rap she gave me. From now on you're staying with me. Naturally. I'll shoot the first man that gets near her. All right, go on, lie down. You expect me to sleep here? Yep. But why do you pick the most uncomfortable place? You'll find out. There, we can do without this, though. Now go on. Get some sleep. I don't trust you. Go on. Lie down. So, you're the same low breed as your men. Well, you know how it is, baby, we're all rough, tough Legionnaires. So, you really didn't rescue me after all. You were only saving me for yourself. You catch on quick. For a moment, Sergeant, I... I thought you had a grain of decency in you. Well, we all make mistakes. Did I hurt your vanity? Well, it serves you right. You ought to know by now that to me, you're strictly a military objective. Oh! Look, kid, why don't you relax, make things easy on yourself. Three more days and I'll have you back with your people. You won't live three more days. It is of a roughness. It is of a noisiness too. I'm a light sleeper. One false move out of you during the night and I'll tie you to the belly of a horse for the rest of the trip. Pleasant dreams. Lie down! The sergeant and the girl sleep there. We must bring her to safety before we attack. Of course we must. Get the girl. Go to sleep. Will you go to sleep? You fool! You'll hit the girl! Our machine gun. They can thank our big-hearted sergeant for that. Fine way for Hussin to treat his bride! He didn't know it was I. Well, I got no time to argue, now stay put. This firing is endangering Mahla. I'm as concerned for her safety as you. Legionnaires! Give us the girl, we give you your lives. You've got to do it, Kincaid. We're through. Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut. You can't make a deal with that lying rat. Hussin! Come and get her. Reload the machine gun and we'll charge the position. No, Excellency. With Mahla there I cannot permit it. There will be no more delays, even if the girl is lost in the attack. But the wedding, Your Excellency. Her death at the hands of the Legionnaires will serve as well. Why don't they come? They're going to rush us. If we can stop 'em we have a chance of getting out. Never. Allah has doomed you. Not if he lets this sand storm blow full blast! Charge! Here they come! Back! Get back, you dogs! Mouse. Yeah. Got the horses before they rush us again. And let's hope this stuff has blown thick enough to cover us. Get going. Yeah. Let's go. Keep down low, now. I can see nothing with this sand blowing in my eyes, little Mouse. How does the sergeant know where we are going? He keeps his eyes closed. If this compass is right and if this map is right, we should reach the mountains and Kahlim's water hole sometime tomorrow, if I'm right. Kahlim's water hole, that's a Riff village, Mike. I know, I'll take a chance they've all gone to join Hussin. It's the last place they'd look for us. Will you help me to escape? Huh? My father is an important Sheik. You would be taken safely to any port in Africa and you will be rewarded. For a job like that... I'd have to have the cash in advance. Here, drink this. Ah, if this was only beer. As long as you're dreaming, make mine cognac. Lots of beer and cognac in Tarfa. And Tarfa is just over those hills. We can climb them under the cover of darkness without horses. Tomorrow's the fifth day. We can go back. Major Berthot and the regiment will be there. And medals for all of us. What do you say now, Jardine? I'll be glad it's over when it's over. Home tomorrow! Hey! Hey! Hey! Look! It's a Legion truck! I'll fix it man, and we'll go for a ride. Afraid I'll run away? Go ahead. I'll wait. Must be one the Riffs stole from Sidi-Abahd, eh? Yeah. Yeah. There's plenty of gasoline left. It will never run again. Hey! It's a payroll truck. What? Payroll truck? Look! The safe! Do you think there's still money in it? Sure, look, the Riffs couldn't crack it. You've got to be civilized to crack a safe. Oh, you've got to be an expert. Listen! Listen to the squeaking of the little Mouse. Do you think you can open it, Mouse? Huh? Uh, I... I don't know. My fingers have grown callused. Here, Mouse, scrape off the calluses with this. Yeah. You got it? It is too light. I always work best in the dark. Here. Here, get under this. Yeah. Yeah, try this. All right, come on. Come on, expert. Whew! Oh, in the old days it was so easy, a nice, cool bank. Confidence, little Mouse. Huh? Confidence. You can do it, Mouse. Yea, we believe in you. Sure. I'll try. Watch out for the police. Shh! He must have silence. I'm sorry this had to happen to you. Spare me your sympathy. I've borne worse ordeals than this. I expect nothing better from you. Well, it'll be all over tomorrow. I'll be setting you free. Am I to be grateful for that? Look! War's end. This one will too. Maybe someday you'll... Oh, I see. The merciful conqueror. Well, you're not back in Tarfa yet, Sergeant. And even if you do get back, even if you guard it with a hundred regiments, we shall take it. You're tough, baby. I like that. But not too tough. I like that too. Mike... Mike, the men have gone crazy. Money! Millions of francs. The Legion payroll truck. Mouse cracked the safe and now they've gone crazy. Mouse, you've made us all rich. We'll divide it all even. You're crazy! Huh? You can have my share. What's the matter, Jardine? Suddenly you don't like money? That's government money. It wouldn't take 'em long to figure out who'd been here and found it. You'd be saps to get yourselves into a new jam just when we're about to get out of this one. He's crazy. He's right, men. Not that you don't deserve it. If I had my way I'd let you keep it, but you'd just be building yourselves up to an awful letdown. Pierre, throw me that sack. Aw, Mike... The next time, before you count yourselves millionaires... Be sure you get your cash in advance. You'd better clean up and get some sleep. We've got a long climb. We're moving out right after dark. Sure, Sarge. Right after dark. No. He tried to steal the money. The dirty double-crosser. We ought to kill him. Hey, I got the money. Hey, Mike, here's the girl. Lucky you woke up. Yeah... lucky. Thanks. I didn't fire. Good boy, Kurt. What do you think, Mike? One lone scout. If there were more of them, they'd have picked us off by now. Lucky he didn't get back to tell his friends he found us. Let's hope they're not close enough to hear those shots. Londos, Browning, and now Jardine. Look! Now my people will see you. They'll come from the direction. None of you will escape. They'll be on our tout de suite. What's the use to climb the cliffs? At dawn they'll swat us like flies on a wall. You're finished, all of you. And you, where does that leave you? Let her alone. I'm going to need you just once more, baby. You'll all get back to Tarfa tomorrow, every last one of you. You think he has an even chance to keep them off us, and still get through? With him the chance is always better than even. That's our cue. Let's get moving. We've got a long climb to Tarfa. I'm coming through. Anyone makes a move and I'll kill her. Cowards! Why do you wait? It you want her to live, stand back. Take him! I command you to take him. He won't shoot. Don't kill him. Quite right, my dear. He is mine to dispose of. It's a pity I have to leave soon for my marriage ceremony. Don't stay on my account. I imagine it'll be dawn before you finally die. I should like to watch your entire performance. To the very end. It may not be all you hope for. It will be. You would be surprised at how much Tovic can get from even the most phlegmatic types. Tovic and I have had a long and close association. From the cradle, was it not? I detect a strong family-resemblance. Let us delay no longer. Stop! Are the marriage vows you are about to take as empty as the others? You promised he would not be harmed tonight. True, but I attack Tarfa tomorrow and I'm weary of delay. Or is it endless delays you desire? I see. Apparently your five days and nights together weren't entirely hostile. Are there sweeter things now than revenge? Yes. I do not want him harmed. Ever. Release him. No. I say he goes free. And I say he dies. There will be no marriage if you do this. What! Yes. Kill him and you kill everything you desire. The marriage, the alliance of our tribes, victory over the French, everything. And if I spare him? You shall have everything. Your sacred oath, you'll do nothing to resist the marriage? My oath. Very well. I'll see you again, Sergeant, at the gates of Tarfa. Get out. I'm in no hurry. Please go. Please. What are you doing here? And what are they doing here? They volunteered to come back and rescue you. Yeah, just like we volunteered the first time. So we coaxed them a little. When the sergeant is away, the corporals are in command, no? They're being called to the wedding, Mike. The way she looked at you, I don't think she wants to marry him. She'll go through with it, she gave her oath. Sarge, you're not thinking of stealing her again? Come on, Mike, we've got to get back to Tarfa. Yes, the regiment is back. How about it, Sarge? You boys go ahead. I'm going to a wedding. We can't let him go to a wedding like that. The least we can do is to get him a Riff outfit. Hey, Mike! I don't know, little Mouse. I haven't been invited. That's okay, Roshko. I invite you. Weddings always make me cry. That I got to see. Leave your weapons. Leave your weapons. Sheik Ben Allal has decreed a night of peace. Leave your weapons. Defile not this marriage by bearing arms. Leave your weapons. Sheik Ben Allal has decreed a night of peace. Enter not here bearing arms. Leave your weapons. This is a night of peace. Leave your weapons. Enter here as men of good will. Leave your weapons. Put down your arms. This is a night of peace. Guards, leave your weapons here. They dishonor our Sheik by entering here with weapons. Here ye, brothers. Here ye, brothers. Allah twice blesses this union, for two tribes who have always been enemies shall, by this marriage, be united in friendship. Kneel you now before your master. Know you now, my daughter... Our Princess stoops beneath herself to kneel to her inferiors. Silence. Is it not enough our noble Caid favors your Sheik's scrawny daughter? Shame. Our Sheik has decreed a night of peace. Shh. Shh. Shame. You will serve him well and faithfully, ministering to his wants in peace, praying for his victory in battle. Your noble Caid is a lump of evil-smelling goat cheese. Eat those words, you son of a swine. Yes, eat them. Shame! Silence! Shh. Go on. Caid Hussin, master of mankind... How can an animal be the master of mankind? Yeah. How can an animal be the master of mankind? Listen to the squeaking of the little Mouse. Not a mouse, a rat! And you are lice. - Dogs! - Jackals. Cowards! Liars. Cheats. Murderers! Silence, dogs! Silence! Guards! Stop them! Here come the guards. Keep them busy and I'll go for the girl. Sure, Mike. Mike! Stand back. Our positions are reversed, Sergeant. I won't be as hesitant as you. If you want the girl to live, get out of my way! Citizens of Tarfa, this is a day long to be remembered. We are assembled here to honor these bravo men, for the most glorious of all achievements, the bringing of peace. In the name of the President of the Republic, the people of France, I decorate you with the military medal. Major Berthot, will you make the presentation please. Lieutenant Kruger, you do the honors. The full honors, Lieutenant. Congratulations, Sergeant. Battalion dismissed. My mother's... I know she'd of wanted you to have it.
