A Shochiku Film A Shochiku-Imamura Co-production JANUARY 4, 1964 Let us go To the Temple The Temple of Paradise How old are you, Detective? Fifty-five. I'll probably get the death sentence. If it takes them three years to hang me, I'll be 40. No matter how I fight, I'll never live to your age, that's for sure. Fifty-five... Ten years older than I'll ever be, and you'll live longer still. Life isn't fair! Fine coming from a man who took five innocent lives! I won't be here anymore, but you will. You get to hang around and fuck. Stop singing, Enokizu! I suppose it'll be freezing in the nick. It's going to be damn cold in the nick! VENGEANCE IS MINE Produced by INOUE Kazuo Based on the novel by SAKI Ryuzo Screenplay by BABA Masaru Cinematography by HIMEDA Shinsaku Music by IKEBE Shinichiro Starring: OGATA Ken OGAWA Mayumi BAISHO Mitsuko SAKAI Frankie, KITAMURA Kazuo MIYAKO Chocho, KIYOKAWA Nijiko MIKUNI Rentaro Directed by IMAMURA Shohei Stand back, stand back! Move aside! Make way! Die, Enokizu! I'll kill you, Enokizu! Enokizu! Good morning! There's nothing good about it! Just look at my plot. - What happened? - It's always the same. Some Korean drunk wandered in and fell asleep again. I'll go and take a peek. Sorry. Why does she want grated radish with fish anyway? That daughter-in-law of mine is so clueless. He's dead! And he's not Korean! He's Japanese! VICTIM: SHIBATA TANEJIRO CAUSE OF DEATH: SKULL CRUSHED WITH BLUNT OBJECT AND STAB WOUND TO CHEST ESTIMATED TIME OF DEATH: BETWEEN 2:00 & 5:00pm, OCTOBER 18 NATURE OF DEATH: HOMICIDE VICTIM: BABA DAIHACHI CAUSE OF DEATH: MASSIVE BLOOD LOSS FROM STAB WOUNDS ON FACE, NECK, CHEST ESTIMATED TIME OF DEATH: BETWEEN 4:30 & 7:00pm, OCTOBER 18 NATURE OF DEATH: HOMICIDE So you flagged down the truck at 2:00pm on the 18th. You're sure about that? Shibata Tanejiro's collection bag contained 269,000 yen at that point in time. You used this note to buy a radio when you were on the run. Look at it. There's human blood on it. Shibata Tanejiro's blood! We've got hard evidence! It's no use stonewalling! Inspector, could you lend me some nail clippers? I haven't been convicted yet, and I'd like to maintain good hygiene. It's still snowing. Must be three years since we had snow around the New Year. January 9th: He says he had difficulty sleeping last night due to the cold. He has refused to cooperate all day in preparing a statement. He says since we already know his crimes, we should write it up ourselves. But it's our job to extract a confession from him detailing his 78 days on the run. OCTOBER 18, 1963 CHIKUHASHI CITY, FUKUOKA What the hell are you doing here? This is Enokizu. He drives for Saikai Transport. - How many times did we drive together? - Four or five. - This here is Daihachi "The Rock". - There you go again. His real name is Baba Daihachi. He's incorruptible, so everybody calls him "The Rock"! I guess that makes you two opposites! - Keep that up and you'll be walking! - Sorry. - How many more stops you got? - Three more. All in Kanda? - That's perfect. - Why? A friend of mine runs a pig yard behind the station. That's where I'm headed. - Why not stop by with me? - For drinks? No way! I may be nearing retirement, but I'm still a proud employee of the great Japan Tobacco & Salt. What's going on? Some kind of incident. This is Kanda, Kanda... Search the area thoroughly! Enokizu! Do you think these persimmons are sweet? If so, I'll take some as a present for Daihachi. That incorruptible Daihachi. He's probably pissed off at me for drinking on the job. Come on! It'll be all right as long as I'm back in half an hour. Is he still up ahead, this bootlegger you talked about? Enokizu! Goddamn it! What the hell? Those won't make no present! Where's Shibata gone off to? It's getting late. He said to tell you he's red in the face from the drink. He wants you to wait another half hour. - It's 4:00 already. - So give him 20 minutes. You can still get back by 5:00. I'll go and see how he's getting along. - How much? - 650 yen. - This one? - 430 yen. The cheaper one'll do. You sure he's drinking way up here? I don't get it. It's after 5:00 already. Stop. Baba... I killed Shibata. Don't kill me! I beg you! My daughter needs me! I promise I won't tell anyone! Don't kill me! Do as I say! I'll take you to the hospital. This isn't a hospital! What are you doing? I swear I won't say a word. I'd like this. Is that Mari? Is the madam in? She's not? Where did she go? I'll call again later. A body has been found. At about 5.00pm on the 17th, the badly decayed body of a woman was discovered by a housewife at a cement yard in Kita Kyushu... Is that the damn press again? Just try and break me! I'm not making a statement! Have some respect for a man's life. Don't make this difficult. Just tell us how you killed Shibata. Where did you get the stiletto? Listen... Be sure you get this down right. Hata Chiyoko gave me the stiletto. She told me to stab him with it. That's not what she told us. Did you check her story out? Right, here's what she told us yesterday. "The stiletto was to stab him if I had to. "I wanted to break up with him. "If he refused, I'd settle things with the stiletto." Hey, this really is the last time. You want seaweed on yours? You promised last time that it was the last. Eat. Have some pickled radish, too. "Delicious rice ball. Shall we eat another one a little later?" You and me, let's go somewhere far away. I can't live without you. Let's live together. And if I refuse? I'll kill you. I'll kill you first! All right, all right! I said all right! I went to stab him in the balls, but he just cowered and said if I felt that way, we could split up. I didn't waste time getting out. What happened to the stiletto? I left it there. - In the apartment? - Yes. The next night I got a call from him. The night of the murder? "Come to Osaka with me now," he says. - And? - I turned him down, of course. - Why? - Why? I'm married, aren't I? Didn't stop you before. Besides, I could guess how things would end up if I went with him. Hey, they've done it! He runs into position and catches the ball. It's over, 2-0! The Nishitetsu Lions have come from behind to win the series. The entire team gathers on the mound. Manager Nakanishi is on his way as fans pour onto the field. Truck Driver Sought In Murder Case The sea is so dark. We must be about halfway between Shikoku Island and Honshu. If you jumped in here, I reckon they'd never find you. You're right there. "Dear Parents and Kazuko, Hiroko and Aiko. Forgive my untimely departure from this life. Sorry for all the trouble I've caused. I'm too emotional to write any more. Remember me for the fool I was, and forgive me. Best wishes to all. Aboard the Uko ferry, Iwao." So, from January to August this year, you lived with Enokizu in Chikuhashi? Yes, he worked for a PR firm in Beppu, and often stopped by my restaurant on his way to their Kokura branch. And he gave me these. The Konpira Lounge. Were you working as a stripper then? I was taking a break from it. Excuse me asking, but did you know he was married? Yes, I did. But he said it was a marriage of convenience, for some kind of religious reason. He was good to me. But he couldn't keep his hands off me. And since I have a child to think about, I became a nervous wreck. I see. This here... This is something else he gave me. I was the one who wanted to break it off. Now I feel like I failed him. We will soon be arriving in Matsue. Right, if we have any more questions, we'll come find you again. Oh, yeah, they found a postcard addressed to you on the Uko ferry. Thanks. "I have reached the final station on my life's journey and started down the path to the next world. Everyone I see looks like the police. I stand frozen amidst the throng." Wait, Detective! Why didn't you show me this first? It's a suicide note! It's probably bogus. Take it easy. - Why didn't you show me this first? - Calm down! GOTO INN I appreciate your coming all this way to inform us. Iwao's been no end of trouble ever since he was little, but I never imagined he'd murder anyone. I just don't know what to say. For our investigation, we need the names of friends and acquaintances he might turn to. We'll help in any way we can. How could this happen? He was such a gentle child. How could this happen? - Kayo! - How could this happen? Mother... Take her to the other room so she can pray. There's an evil spirit living in this house. An evil spirit lives in this house! I'm so sorry. Welcome! - Is anyone back there? - Coming! We have guests! Welcome. Please come in. Forgive the interruption. Not at all. We're sorry to intrude. Is your wife ill? Yes. It goes back 20 years. She's had a weak heart since when we lived in the Goto Islands and Iwao's always been a source of worry to her. - So you're from the Goto Islands? - Yes. SUMMER, 1938 So you're Enokizu Shizuo? You awkward bastard! You Christians are the only ones refusing to provide boats! Nobody disobeys orders from the military! We don't mean to refuse. But...why do we Catholics have to give up all our boats? - It's not fair... - Bastard! Stand up! Will you give us the boats? Iwao! Damn Christian! You scum! Don't! Stay out of this! You idiot! - Is that your boy? - Iwao! Please forgive him. Cut it out! - You can have the boats. - Good. Now say, "With great pleasure, I offer our boats to the emperor." "With great pleasure... "...I offer our boats... "...to the emperor." Iwao, come home! It's supper time. Come on, let's go. Dad's such a damn weakling! You shouldn't say such things. He let them have the boats and apologised. He lost to them. Iwao, you're just a little boy. There's a lot you don't understand... I know what I saw! Let us go With the money the navy gave me for the boats, l bought an inn in Beppu. But Iwao's rebellious streak just kept on getting worse, and he had to spend the whole war in a reform school. AUTUMN, 1946 There's nothing to worry about, miss. Everything's gonna be fine, okay? When he stole an American jeep, he was sent to prison for two years. We thought if he had a wife he might settle down, so we arranged a marriage for him. KANNAWA HOT SPRINGS, BEPPU - Hello? - Welcome. - I'm looking for Enokizu Iwao. - Iwao...? Who you are? I'm Omura Kazuko from Fukuoka. Iwao's getting his hair cut. He's meeting a prospective bride. - Bride? - Yes. If it's important, I can take a message for him. That's all right. It's great to see you. What's the matter? You're getting married. No, it's just some girl that my dad insisted I meet. Ugly as sin. No way I'm marrying her! In her photograph she looks like this. Where are you going? Can I meet your parents? Not today. This prospective bride's coming. O Lord, hear my prayers... You idiot! Bringing her here the very day you're meeting... Look, I said I was sorry! Anyway, I want to marry her, not that other monster. If you say I can't cos she's a Buddhist, I'll get her baptised tomorrow. - You can't object to that. - I'll never allow it! Father... I don't have anything against this girl. But I won't tolerate your attitude! Excuse me... I'm... three months' pregnant. What'll we do about the other one? - Shall we have the meeting? - Don't be a fool! What's that woman up to? Maybe she's been in contact with Enokizu. Maybe she lets him know that we're staking out the place by standing there like that. Eggs from the hot springs of hell! They're really hot so watch your fingers. Don't worry, I'll remember whose is whose. Good business! How much do you make in a day? - Have one. - Thanks. I've always wanted to try one. Can you tell us why you go to the pier every morning? I don't know myself. Do you think he'll kill himself? Who knows? I guess that would make things easier for you guys. Or am I wrong? Do you need to take him alive for some reason? It must be tough on you. I spend every day in hell. When did you become a Catholic? After I got married. I understand you left him once, then married him again. I found out he'd been lying to me all along. But Jesus says the worst sin is to give up hope, so I thought we should face our difficulties. And I have tremendous respect for my father-in-law. SPRING, 1959 AKAGAWA HOT SPRINGS Kazuko? Please come back. Please. I'm begging you. You shouldn't be slaving away in this backwater. Please come back to us. Father... Iwao's sins are my own. I won't allow him do it again. Mother, too... She misses her grandchildren. Grandpa! It's such a shame you're out here in the middle of nowhere. Come home to Beppu with Grandpa, okay? Let's all three of us together beg Mummy to go back to Beppu. Father, it was a big decision for me to leave. I can't just turn around and go back. But you and Iwao are both baptised Catholics. You know God doesn't approve of divorce. Shall I scrub your back for you? That's okay. Please allow me. Coming all this way can't have been easy. No. I've been thinking it over. I think I'll go back to Beppu after all. You will? I'm so glad. Mother will be glad, too. - And maybe Iwao can... - I'm not going back for Iwao. Or for Mother. I know. You want to please God... Not to please God either. I'm going back... for you. Let's change places. It's my turn...to scrub your back. You're tired. So tired. Does that hurt? No. My hands are rough from grappling with fishing nets and pulling oars for so many years. It's raining. You poor thing. It's cold. Kazuko... Get into bed or you'll catch a cold. KOKURA PRISON, TWO WEEKS LATER SERVING A 30-MONTH SENTENCE FOR FRAUD You look well. Hey, stand up. Never mind. Kazuko was working in Shikoku, but I brought her home a couple of weeks ago. We're registering her as your wife again. Why can't you mind your own fucking business? How can you say that? You vowed before God to stay together till death do you part. Suit yourself. I'll send the papers. Put your seal on them. What about mother? How's she doing? Not so good. Stay out of trouble and stop giving her grief. Where's my father-in-law? He went out. Said he had a meeting. I thought the innkeepers' association meeting was tomorrow. Bring some sake over here. - One for you? - Thanks. I think the big man was just being discreet. What do you mean? He knows I'm crazy about you! No, Mr Yasuda. You've had too much drink. Come on. It must be lonely with your husband away. Have another drink. Ah, you like it! Have some more. No! - Just relax. - You're hurting me, Mr Yasuda. As long as it's you hurting and not me, I don't care! Stop it! - Stop! - I won't stop it. Stop! Well, well, well. Your body's saying keep going. Stop it! Come on, Kazuko. I have your father-in-law's approval. Father... Let us go To the Temple of Paradise... SUMMER, 1960 RELEASED ON PAROLE FROM KOKURA PRISON Why didn't you come straight home? Well done, your long ordeal is over. How's your health, Ma? Not so good, not so bad. How about you? Right as rain. Just found myself a job. Really? This time I'm going to make an honest living. It's a PR company. That's good, considering you're 36 already. I asked a fortune teller about you the other day. She said you were destined to stand above others. That made me happy. Spending money. - Thanks, Ma. - Don't mention it. Anytime you want to see me, I know why. - How's Pa? Same as always? - Same as always. He killed a dog the other day. He said it bit Kazuko. He got so angry and went and caught it. He buried it up to its neck, then he poured boiling water over its head. Pa did that? It was Kazuko who poured the boiling water. She's so headstrong there's no telling what those two might get up to. Welcome home. It's good to have you back. How are the kids? They're fine. They're both at school. Come here. Aren't we husband and wife? Is something going on? What's going on? Nothing. I was in the nick a hell of a long time. I'd understand if you got lonely and fancied a bit on the side. I'm the one at fault. So I won't be mad. Just tell me. Who was it? - Was it my Pa? - How can you even say that? Everyone thinks there's something going on between you two. It's all lies. When you think about it, though, it'd be perfectly natural if something happened. Would you like that? Only if it happened once. What kind of man are you? You're not in prison anymore. You can give up your sick daydreams now. How exactly does a man of God seduce his own son's wife? I'd like to have seen that. Nothing happened between us. I swear to God. Then who was it? Tell me! Who was he? Please forgive me. It was all my fault. Tell me! Come on! Are you assistant station master Yasuda? I called last night. Enokizu from the Goto Inn. Let's talk over there. Here's the 50,000 yen you told me to bring. Please understand. I had no idea she had a husband. I'll never do it again... Of course you won't! Or I'll burn your fucking house down. - But it was your father's idea. - What did you say? He practically encouraged me. He approved. - Is that true? - What are you doing? Let go of me! Let go! All aboard! Did my wife know? Not at first. - What did she do when she found out? - The train is about to depart! It'll cost you another 50,000 yen! I'll get it! I'll get it! How low can you get? What kind of father pimps his son's wife? What are you talking about? I never did that. - Can you say that in front of Yasuda? - Of course. I just felt sorry for Kazuko and I happened to mention it to Yasuda... That's where you went too far! Did you ever think about Kazuko? She was your wife again, but what did she have to live for? All the neighbours knew about you so she had to protect her kids from the things they said. She had to nurse your sick mother and fill in for her, running the inn. What's so funny? We're family, we can take it, but Kazuko's not. That has nothing to do with what I'm saying. What about how I feel? Kazuko, were you doing my old man every night I was in prison? - Don't be a fool! - Yasuda told me. You spread your legs wide and said "Father." I never said that. - Don't lie to me! - Lay off her! Shit. You act so pious, while you worship the mole on your daughter-in-law's arse! How dare you? You're no man. You're an animal. Come outside. You lay off Kazuko! If you really don't believe her, then take this axe to my head! Do it. Do it! You're my own son, and yet I can't stand the sight of you. Do it. You'd take a swing at your husband? How much more do you intend to make us suffer? I wasn't born yesterday. I can see what's going on. So you can stop your play-acting! A guy I knew in prison was doing his wife and her mother at the same time. - A mother and daughter sandwich! - Iwao! I hope I'm born a woman in my next life, so I can marry into this family! OCTOBER 26 ENOKIZU SURFACES AT A RESTAURANT IN OKAYAMA NOVEMBER 18 ENOKIZU SWINDLES 80,000 YEN IN HIROSHIMA Hamamatsu Station next. Arriving now on platform one is the Tokyo-bound train. NOVEMBER 23 HAMAMATSU STATION I'm looking for a quiet inn, something small and hidden away. - If I can get a girl, all the better. - I know a place. - Is it far? - No, it's fairly close. It's up this alley on the right. THE ASANO INN Excuse me... You've got a customer. Welcome. The driver said this was the best inn around here for a relaxed stay. - Must've been Nemoto Taxis. - I'll carry it. It's upstairs. This way. Sounds like he has a cold. That's my mother. She's been in bed for three days. - Let me do that. - That's all right. Much obliged. I need your name for the register. Just fill it out yourself. I'm afraid it's required. I'm no good at writing characters. I teach micro analytic chemistry at Kyoto University. Equations are no trouble, but I can't remember how to write my own name. Kyoto University is one of the national schools, right? Would you find it strange if a university professor asked you to find him some female company? No, I'll send for someone right away. What would be your type, Professor? Someone like Yamamoto Fujiko. No, Gina Lollabrigida. "Even the scholar, hard in pursuit of knowledge, wants a woman's touch." Very good. Please pay the girl directly. It'll be four notes. - Understood. - Excuse me, then. "When you're on the run, 4,000 yen is no trifling sum." Mother? Shall I call Dr Kadokura? I hate doctors. Not again, Professor. You're insatiable. Feels like someone's watching us. The granny here has a reputation for it. The old bag with the cold? I thought she was in bed with a raging fever. I didn't wash my hands after mah-jong. That's disgusting, Jun. Listen, could you lend me 100,000 yen? I'm sick of managing a coffee shop. I'm going to subcontract for Yamaha. No way. Last time I loaned you money, you blew it at the races. Who told you that? Matsunaga. Come on. Just 50,000 yen, then. Please. I like this spot right here. Stop it, Jun! It's not the money I'm worried about. Get over your cold first, then you can go to the races! I'm already over my cold! Unlike you, I don't have mah-jong and men to fool around with! At least let me go to the races, you cheapskate! Ignore them. They fight all the time. See, you're still coughing up phlegm. So what if I am? Is this any way to treat your mother? Stop acting so high and mighty! You're just a kept woman! Damn fool! Calm down, Grandma! With a cough like that, you need to take it easy. I'm so sorry we woke you up. No, I was already up. - She gets like this all the time. - You what? Now, now, Grandma. Did I hear something about boat races? Here, take this and go. Blow some money. It'll blow your cold away too. You mustn't, Professor. You'll spoil her. It's all right. I have a mother in Kyoto but I seldom get to do anything nice for her. Well, I need to get to the university. If you get a call from a Professor Tomita, could you please tell him I'm on my way? - Good morning. - You're taking your time. The professor kept me up all night. Hello? Asano Inn. The professor left some time ago for your office. Really? That's very odd. Oh, here he is now. Let me put him on. I missed a train and had to wait for the next. I'll take some butter and corned beef. When will you learn to keep proper books? You're slick with the secret accounts. You said to keep two sets of books. There's a limit to what you can get away with, you idiot! You had that young fellow here again last night for mah-jong. You can't expect me to play mah-jong by myself. There were three young guys here. Welcome back. I'll be right up with some tea. Is that guy staying a while? He's a university professor from Kyoto. What? Looks more like an assistant manager for a textile company. - Still got a thing going with that lad? - How could I...? Don't give me that! I had Wakasugi check up on you. Isn't that nice? What about you? You get yourself a new woman... And take out a new mortgage on this place without a word to me. I hear you're financing a bar for her. The man from the bank told me everything. Dumb bitch! After 16 years, you should know how I operate. An eye for an eye. You promised you'd pay off the mortgage by the end of the year and transfer the house into my name. First of all, I have to fire some people and pay their severance money. You promised me. The Olympics should help the economy, but there's no telling if we'll see the benefits in textiles. You have to keep your promise... I'm getting a cramp in my foot! Don't worry, I promise. Professor, I wish you'd have a word with my daughter. Tell her to break up with that young fellow. I'm just passing through. It's not my place. But you're a university professor, she'll listen to you. That man of hers still loves her. If she got rid of that young fellow, it would be for the best. Her sugar daddy would pay her like always. How's the inn doing these days? So-so. I bet Miss Haru's got a tidy sum stashed away. I wonder. She's not that clever. I wouldn't mind if she were cheating on him with you. Please talk to her. Good luck at the races. I hope you win. I'm back. Welcome back. You drinking? Will you join me, Professor? Of course. Come in. - Something for you. - What is it? It was supposed to be some books but it might've turned into something else. - It's a present. - Thank you. You're so sweet. Have some. Too bad all men aren't as thoughtful as you, Professor. That's rather bold. The sake? No, you. Maybe so. And the professor away from his wife asks for a call girl every night. I wouldn't have to if you'd come to me. No, no, hands off. I don't trust men anymore. Good evening. Mrs Asano? - Shall I get it? - No, I will. Sit down. I can get it. You must be Mr Asano. I'd like you to put up one of these "wanted" posters. Very well. Have you noticed anything unusual about any of your guests? Nothing in particular. If you do, please call us. Sorry to disturb you. We appreciate your trouble. Was it a policeman? Yeah. He gave me a poster to put up. Never mind that. Let's carry on drinking. Come on. What took you so long? I called the club ages ago. How long does it take from there to here? I'm sorry. It's that professor again, right? He said he'd be here a week. It's nice of him to call me again. No. Your customer is the one in the bath right now. Oh? Where's Mrs Asano? In bed with a stomach-ache. Really? This medicine works great for that. Never mind. She's actually with the professor. The professor? I see. What are you looking at? I do a lot of travelling, so I like to look at maps. There's still lots of places I haven't been to. It's reassuring. Small as Japan is, it's still a big place. It's the opposite of you. What do you mean? You're tighter than I expected. I can tell you haven't had kids. You're too frank, Professor. Well, my lectures at the university have finished, so I have to get back to Kyoto. What's your wife like? Just an ordinary woman. It was an arranged marriage. I had no say in it. Your mother's an interesting woman. Interesting? I'd just say she was different. No, really. She must've been through a lot. She's certainly not ordinary. There's something very unusual about her. I guess that's why you're a university professor. You're a good judge of character. You think so? This isn't exactly a secret but she killed someone once. Killed someone? It was the year the war ended. She was being starved and bullied. DECEMBER 3 - ENOKIZU IWAO SPOTTED IN FUKUSHIMA DECEMBER 8 - ENOKIZU IWAO SCAMS 22,000 YEN IN HOKKAIDO DECEMBER 12 - CHIBA DISTRICT COURT Will the defendant please step forward? Do you understand the charges the prosecutor has just read? Then let me ask you this. To the charge that you stole 50,000 yen in cash from the Matsushita household at 2-1-4, Minato-machi, Chiba, how do you respond? Say it's not true, Tsutomu! The other guy made you do it! Say something please! Be quiet. The defendant may be seated. Will the prosecutor please present the evidence? Tsutomu will be released on bail at 2:00pm. I'm sorry, I don't believe I know you. Miss Wakita of the probation office? I've heard a lot about you. My name is Aihara. I'm a lawyer specialising in bail matters. Tsutomu's attorney, Mr Kubota, asked me to arrange his release. Have we met before? One can't belong to the Chiba legal circle and not know you, Miss Wakita. You flatter me! There's Mr Kubota now. Has bail been set? Not yet, but very shortly. You needn't worry. I appreciate your help. How much were you able to bring? 100,000 yen. May I ask where you studied, Mr Aihara? Tokyo University. My father was a judge in the Tokyo High Court. I wanted to go to Waseda University and become a journalist but he made me study Law at Tokyo University. - So you're one of the elite. - Not at all. About the bail amount... With 100,000 yen, you should be fine. I'll try to bring them down. Thank you. Oh, before he's released it'd be a good idea to pay Tsutomu a visit. Remind him how important it is to adhere to the bail conditions and how much trouble it was for his mother to raise the bail. - You're right. - Thanks for lunch. Did Miss Wakita go to see Tsutomu? I just called the courthouse. Let's step in here. We'll know the bail amount in five minutes or so. I'll go and pay it for you. At that point, a release form will be issued and Tsutomu will be out in no time, so you can just wait here. Shall I take the money? Thank you so much. Here it is. I appreciate all your help. I'll take care of it. - Chiba station. - Wait! I was waiting first! - Where are you going? - The station. Get in then. Please hurry. What a stroke of luck, meeting an attorney like this. A meeting ordained by fate. When it comes to buying property, I'm on unfamiliar ground. And with the seller in prison, it makes things even worse. Which bar association do you belong to? The Second Bar Association. Where do you live? In Zoshigaya, near Ikebukuro. I live alone in an old apartment and do as I please. It can't be easy living alone. Not at all, I'm used to it. Would you care to stop for sukiyaki? I'd like to ask you some questions. Sir! Sir! - My shoes! - Weren't you staying until noon, sir? The call girl never came. If she's not coming, you could at least tell me! My shoes! - Didn't you stay up, Mother? - Shoehorn! I must've nodded off. I'm terribly sorry, sir. I thought the girl was with you. How much for an overnight? It's normally 2,000 yen, but 1,000 yen will do. I'm so sorry. I phoned the club more than once. Why didn't she come? You shouldn't have fallen asleep! I was exhausted. From the boat races? Hello? Is that Club Shiragiku? This is the Asano Inn. Why didn't your girl come last night? We left the door open. I hate to say this, but all the girls say that they're scared of your mother. And she peeps at them, too. The three men are Enokizu Iwao, Nishihara Kenzo... Hey, that's the professor. What professor? The guy at the Asano Inn a couple of weeks ago. He was at it all night long. No way! Probably just looks like him. I don't know... He's the spitting image. If he's really a criminal, maybe the police will give you a reward. Let sleeping dogs lie. The police don't exactly approve of our business. That's true. He was seen on October 26th at a restaurant in Okayama... What can I get you, sir? - This sukiyaki beef. - How much would you like? - 400 grams. - 400 grams. Thank you, sir. Welcome, sir. I'd like this. And 30 short nails. - Do you have some tape? - Yes, sir. DECEMBER 15 - ZOSHIGAYA, TOKYO It gets so dirty lately. It's because we have so many more customers. They want to see where Iwao grew up. People like to gawk at others' misery. Tongues are wagging about us sending mother to the hospital, too. What else could we do? She may not even make it to the new year. Then we can finally be together, you and me. You know they'll hang Iwao if they catch him. Watch your tongue. You shouldn't say things like that. I shouldn't speak plainly now, but later it'll be okay? Father! Once things quieten down, you can change your name and remarry. Find someone who'll take your children in too. - I'm supposed to leave you all alone? - There's no other choice. How will you get by? I'm ready for the old folks' home. I'll sit there drooling in the sun. Once or twice a year, you can bring the kids to see me. I'll come every day. I'll lick the drool clean from your lips. The phone's ringing. The Goto Inn. Hello? Damn it! Hey, Granddad! Where is it? Where's the tin opener? Pray tell! Come on in. I brought a guest today. Hey, Grandma, she wants to take a bath. This way, please, Miss. You know that young fellow, Jun something-or-other? - I hear he's in Kagoshima. - Kagoshima? He got married three days ago. He's on his honeymoon. - You're lying! - I had Wakasugi follow him. The bride's from a good family in the textile industry. Oh? Didn't he say anything? He's a total idiot, but you were pretty stupid, too. That's right, I'm stupid. This auction notice came for this house. I may be stupid, but this is too much. You broke your promise. I have a lot of employees to take care of. I have to do a lot of juggling. You always have some ridiculous answer. I'll make good on it before it comes to auction. Stop whining all the time, you idiot. Registered letter for Miss Asano Haru! Coming. Please don't abandon Haru. After all, you're the one who made her a real woman. And she still loves you. Please be good to her. Here's your pay for peeping. It's a naughty little trick you taught me. My, that's a very fine kimono. Is it Oshima silk? It's wool, you idiot. That girl may be young, but her tits sag. I think flaunting her like this is actually a sign that he really cares about you. Mother, that professor sent me some money. "I'm visiting a university in Tokyo. "We scholars are poor, so I can't send much, "but please enjoy some sake with this." He's certainly a kind-hearted man. The Asano Inn. Professor! I just got your letter! Where are you now? Ikebukuro? In Tokyo? Will you take me somewhere far away? Why won't you answer? The Temple of Paradise... Where's that song from? From the islands. Islands? What islands? I really don't know much about you, do I? Actually, when I think about it, I don't know a thing. And you know nothing about me either. But that's all right. Two strangers like animals. Animals... Shall we see this one? Are you hungry? This was John-John's third birthday. He was prompted by his mother to say his final farewell to his father with a salute, bringing tears to every eye. At Mrs Kennedy's request, the funeral procession followed the form of President Lincoln's. The route was lined with 250,000 mourners. And so the United States' young and idealistic leader was mourned by people all over the world and laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery. International News - The End There follows a message from the National Police Agency. This man is former truck driver Enokizu Iwao, age 37. He is the subject of a nationwide manhunt on charges of robbery and murder. He remains at large. On October 18th in Fukuoka Prefecture he murdered two employees of the Japan Tobacco & Salt Corporation. He has a prior conviction for fraud and may be posing as a lawyer or university professor. ANYONE WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THIS MAN IS ASKED TO CONTACT THE POLICE The Liberation of Europe, Part III The Great Siege Shall we die together, Professor? I'm serious. I don't want to drag you into this. You deceived me. I feel bad about that. ENOKIZU'S WHEREABOUTS STILL UNKNOWN Haru, what are you doing? Fixing this. Back from the races? I could hardly leave the place empty with you away. Where were you? - Tokyo. - Tokyo? Doing what? To see the professor. The one who stayed here? Yes. That man's a murderer. There's a nationwide manhunt on. I know. You knew and still...? Where did you leave him? He's here. Upstairs. I'm not that hungry. Once you lose your appetite, you're finished. Won't be long before they get you. Why'd you come back here? Are you going to drag us into this and mess up our lives? - Mother... - Get out! I was in prison myself until just a while ago. After 15 years inside I finally get to lead a normal life again. I don't want anything to do with cops or murderers. Just when I thought I could lead a normal life at last. A normal life? Those 15 years... what do you think I was doing all that time? After what you did, I had to quit the textile company. I practically had to go into hiding. I felt like I could hardly breathe. You turned my whole life upside down. Until then I was like any other girl, I had dreams. Now I'm a kept woman and a procurer. You call that a normal life? Haru! And you're still messing things up for me. Lately the girls don't show up, so customers don't come either. It's because of you. The call girls refuse to come here, because they all say you scare them. Did you know that? I'll go. Yeah, I'll go. - Then I'm going with you. - Why would you do that? It's destiny. Right, Professor? He's no professor. He's Enokizu Iwao. It makes no difference to me. Take me to Okinawa or Taiwan or wherever. You could get yourself killed. I don't care. What have I got to live for anyway? No... I'll leave. Shouldn't you go after her? She'll come right back. You think so? What if she goes to the police? What shall we do? What the hell. If she does, she does. But... What the hell. Are you hungry? I brought you some sweet bean cakes. How am I supposed to win with a jinx like you next to me? You put on sunglasses and come out in the open. You've got nerve. You invited me. I was afraid you and Haru might run off while I was here. What's your call on the next race? How about 3-4 or 3-6? It's a bad day for the threes. They've wiped me out. How about a little loan? Maybe you should pawn your ring. You better treat me nice or I'll call the police. Go ahead and try it. Here. Pick the ones I said. I think I've got it. Since bad luck is stuck on them, I'll avoid the threes. I won 60,000 yen! - Keep it. - No... You take this money and disappear. I won't tell anyone. You can have it all. It's not about the money. Don't kill me, Enokizu. That's what you want to do, isn't it? Ever since you walked out last night. So this is the second time? And the third time's the real one? Wipe that smirk off your face. I suppose you think we're alike as fellow killers? No, not really. But I sort of feel like you're a prison buddy. Well, don't. This isn't prison. It's the real world. - And it's really changed. - Certainly has. The whole world's gone crazy. But you know what? When I killed that old battle-axe, I really wanted to. So I felt great after I did it. Is that how you feel right now? No. So you haven't yet killed who you really want to kill? Maybe not. Then you're all mouth. They'll hang you for sure. What's going on? Your mother phoned me last night. She pleaded with me to make up with you. You shouldn't make her worry so. Did you come just to tell me that? I found some money and paid off the mortgage on this place. Satisfied? That girl ran out on you, didn't she? Same old story. I'm back. Oh, Mr Ideike. Set your girl straight! It doesn't help my reputation to look after the daughter of a murderer! I've put up with a lot over the years! Damn it! And I'm looking after the ex-con mother too! If it weren't for me, you'd both be beggars! Fine talk from a brute who sleeps in a beggar's bed. What? Goddamn it! Who gives a shit? You can't treat me this way! Watch this, you old hag! I'll screw her right in front of you! Mother, help me! - Help! - Shut up! Come on, bitch! You know you want it. Help me! DECEMBER 20 Here! According to investigators, the victim, Kawashima Kyohei, a 68-year-old lawyer was found dead in his ransacked apartment and 50,000 yen has been confirmed missing. Based on witness accounts, investigators speculate the killer may be Enokizu Iwao, already wanted for murder. Witnesses confirm sightings of Enokizu in the Ikebukuro area. - He says he has a fever. - Oh? When all's said and done, Mr Ideike just can't live without you. Men and women get that way when they've been together... - Stop it. - No, I won't! You're a grown woman. You know you'd never get far with him. His picture's plastered everywhere, and all over the TV. The police aren't stupid, you know. Do you really intend to run off with him? If I do, what will you do? Well... I really don't know. I don't have anywhere to go. I suppose I'll die in the gutter somewhere. Tomorrow's the 33rd anniversary of your father's death. Oh, really? The other day, I killed another man in Tokyo. I know. What'll you do... if I die? If they catch me and hang me? I'm not dying with you. There's no way I'm dying with you. I want a child. I want to have your child. I could never get pregnant before, but I will with you. I know it. Haru. I want a baby. I will, I'm sure of it. I want a baby. I didn't know you were up. Are you hungry? I'll fix lunch. - Where's your mother? - Visiting my dad's grave. In about four or five days you'll get to enjoy some very tasty cayenne and garlic pickles. Four or five days? Sounds good. My family used to be farmers. We always had lots of pickles. So you still make them every year? You'll have to make them next year and the year after that, too. Every year, even after I die. Can I have some too? That glass is fine. Tilt it for me. That was good! Give me some more. Far away... Thank you. Marufuku Pawn Shop. Next to Ushiyama Park? The Asano Inn. All right. Dear! We have a customer. He needs cash and wants to pawn some kimonos and furniture. - Where is it? - An inn next to the park. I'll run right over in the truck. Tell him I'll be there at 6:00. Sorry... I'm back. Why don't you turn on a light? Huh? What's all this? Where's Haru? She wasn't feeling well. She's upstairs in bed. Hello? Sushi delivery! - Hello. - Who ordered this? The missus, I guess. Premium sushi for three. I heard you won big at the races, Granny. - It wasn't that much. - Thank you! I suppose I should take one upstairs to her. Mother? What are you doing out of the hospital? If I'm going to die, I want to die at home. - You shouldn't do this. - You should be in bed. I won't die yet. I can't die yet. Hi, Aiko. - The pawnbroker? - Yes. Marufuku. Just up this way. Turn here. I'm a woman, too. I won't let Kazuko have you. Don't say things like that! Go away. How about the TV and refrigerator? Not unless they're brand new, sir. Thanks. I could lend you 100,000 yen for the phone, after I make sure tomorrow that the contract can be transferred. We'll go together. Have some sushi. Thanks. What I'll take today amounts to 46,000 yen. 4,000 yen more would make it even. Did you bring your seal? MARUFUKU PAWN SHOP What is it? Nothing. Officer! I suppose I get transferred to Kokura tomorrow. Take care of yourself. At least until I get hanged, huh? After all this time I still don't get why you killed those two women in Hamamatsu. I don't suppose you do. Can't say I really understand it myself. It was actually three I did there. Three? Someone besides the mother and daughter? The woman was pregnant with my child. I'm positive she was. She was positive too. A tiny me was starting to take shape in her womb. KOKURA PRISON VISITING ROOM I saw a magazine article you wrote, with a picture of you and Kazuko. Some drivel about how you blame yourself. Forget that shit. You've got nothing to do with me. I went to see the priest today. You're being excommunicated. It's about time! So I can't bury you in the family plot. Yesterday your mother passed away. But now when you die I can't bury you next to your mother. Forget it. Just throw my bones in some dump. Is that all you have to say? I'll never forgive you. Who asked you to? But I know God won't forgive me either. Your blood is my blood. The blood of the devil runs in my veins too. I wished you and your mother would hurry up and die. Ever since I wanted to sleep with Kazuko, I wished for it... - As if you haven't already! - No... I managed to tame those base impulses. I can't betray God. You're so full of it. To atone for that I asked the priest to excommunicate me too. I won't be buried in the family plot either. - What'll you do when you die? - I don't know. Iwao... You've got to fear God, even after you're excommunicated. I don't need God. I killed innocent people, so I'll be put to death. That's how it should be. Can't be any other way. Then why did you run for so long? I wanted to be free as long as I could. - Now go home. The visit's over. - Iwao... Father and son, connected by blood... is this all it amounts to in the end? That's right. We'll always be separate, even after death. You say you'll never forgive me. I won't forgive you either. If I was going to kill anybody I should've killed you. You couldn't kill me. You're not the kind who could kill his own father. You saying I'm not man enough? You can only kill those who never harmed you. Damn you. Even now... I wish I could kill you. FIVE YEARS LATER I got a letter from the warden. He said Iwao went to the gallows unafraid. He died bravely. I got a letter too. From Iwao. He said I'd better not find another man, even after he dies. That's so like him. Still, I think you should seriously consider that latest proposal. Change your name so you can remarry and... That's why you asked Aiko not to abandon you? - I never said that. - Yes, you did! You asked Hiroko too. Nothing good can come from you staying on with me. After all, I'm an Enokizu. Iwao always used to say that you were dishonest. Maybe so. But... That's what I like about you. You try. Let us go To the Temple of Paradise Let us go... Here. Go ye ahead along the path To show us the way
