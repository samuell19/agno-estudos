Subtitles by explosiveskull Every time I'm on your program. You cannot boil such a complex social-economic issue into such simplistic... Of course, of course I can. Just because you have a problem with my belief system does not mean that... No, no. I don't. Does... does not mean that these incidences - were not a direct attack on American values... - Mommy, no. - ...and the things that make this country... - Mommy, mommy please. You never come to me. Not that please. No, no, no, no. I hate you. I wish you would just go away. You quit on me. You quit on our benefactor and you quit on the family. We are so... blessed. The shocking story of a gruesome murder-suicide in the affluent suburb of Vista View, where a wife and mother beat her husband to death... Is Maggie going to be okay if we go away? Where is she going to eat? She's going on a date. Some people trust their children. Now there's some high humor right there, Chris. Your time will come when you meet the right guy and we approve. - When you're 50. - Good one, Dad. Thirty seconds that goes in your bag. Mom, I got to cut my reload time. Yeah, boy strives for perfection, Chris. Someday I hope to be mediocre. Ah, you keep trying, you're almost there. I mean, if you spent half the time you do on that thing than on your schoolwork... Mom, I get A's. They don't give out pluses anymore. Exactly, one-tenth of your giant nerd brain for school, half for video games and the rest for devising ways to peep at my friends. Yeah, like I want to peep on your stupid friends. One time Maggie and I were changing... - My God! You are such a liar. - You know, cut it out. ...still trying to determine which half of this deadly couple... Look at this. No history of violence or abuse and then all of a sudden, bam! Murder-suicide. It's unbelievable. Unbelievable. It's not so hard to imagine stasis is an illusion. Once we create something, the world starts working to destroy it. And where did you pick up that little nugget? I'm just saying, you can't fight it. It's like physics. It's a natural law. - Uh, could I be excused? My, uh, battery's dying. - Bowl in the sink. I'm going, too. Trevor Hall just put new rims on Haley, it's all over Insta. We leave in an hour. - Oh, well. Maybe Trevor will let me go in his car. - Never! Angela, do you hear me? We leave in an hour. Okay, okay. Is it too late to home school? It was a joke. I really should fix that bathroom window... with all these crazies out there. God! Do we not have enough problems without you manufacturing new ones? - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. Did you even eat? We've got to get packed. No better than the animals in the jungle. Sam, Sam, we're leaving. Come on. Can't believe you're not coming. You're my buffer. I know but when Brandon Reilly invites you to dinner. Any idea what he wants? Well, it's shaping up to be one hell of a quarter. I think this is how it starts, partner track. Do you see my phone? Hey, Angela's going to be off to college in two years, the boys are growing like weeds. - I don't want you to miss any more of this. - You're such a romantic. Remember when I told you when I proposed to you. Yeah, you said you didn't deserve me. Yeah, I didn't. I still don't and you're still the best thing that ever happened to me. You do. You deserve it all. We do. Give your old man hell. Right. Uh, apologize to Diane for me, will you? Oh, man! You're going to be paying for this until Christmas. Look after the ladies for me now. Dad, for real? You're the man of the house. You drive safe. - Yeah. Bye. - Bye. Bye. I love you. Yeah, we love you. Is everyone belted? - Yes. - Yes. All right, seatbelt, Sam. Belts on, guys, we don't move till those belts go on. Really? No, I'm just doing my job. Oh, in the office next to yours. Yeah, I'd love that. Of course, I'll have the office next to yours, absolutely. I'd love to call you Brandon. Mr. Sharpe, sorry to drop in unannounced like this. - What can I do for you? - Well, I strongly feel I can help you. Are you satisfied with your current level of home security? I'm sorry. Lou Branch, intruder management and protection, cutting-edge security for the private sector. You look to me like a man who is very concerned about his family and to me family is absolutely everything. Right. Well, Mr. Branch, listen, I'm kind of in a hurry right now so... - Call me Lou. - All right. Okay, Lou. - I'm kind of running late for a meeting here. - An important meeting? - Dinner with the boss. - Ah, the first of many I hope. Appreciate your fat wallets and clear skies right onto the horizon. Hey, listen. I appreciate you stopping by but I really have to get ready. Mr. Sharpe, I can't look at this moment and think in some wake of avoidable tragedy that you would look back with this with regret. I can maybe give you 10 minutes. I only need 5. Okay, Lou, lay it out for me. Et voila! The IMP 616, the flagship. Your home encased in a dome of protection distinguishing between your wanted guests and the unwanted violators of your sacred space. It's a microchip. Yes, inserted into a state-of-the-art anklet coded to your DNA. Numbered key cards screen the guests and allow the guests you want. - Okay. - It's time to stand up for your family, Henry. It is time to win the battle of good over evil. Lou, this is fascinating stuff and you definitely have a way about you, but, uh, I got to get a move on. I'll run it past my wife. I look forward to our next meeting. Oh, thank you for inviting me along to dinner tonight, Mr. Reilly. It's nothing. You're a good man, Henry. How long you been with the firm now? - Going on 10 years now. - Hmm. That's quite a run. - Strange business, eh? - Ah. Oldest long con in American history, eh? It's gambling and what do we say, only gambling... It's only gambling if you don't know you're going to win. I fear I have broken that rule. I'm sorry. We have a client, very particular, very demanding, old money, massively diversified. We gambled with his account, good planning, but we caught a bad break. What's the damage? 40 million dollars. Okay. Uh, well, Sir, first thing Monday morning I'm going to break open the books. I can fix it. You already have, son. - You are going to take the fall here. - What? The partnership can't be held responsible. It'll sink us, but a junior member... No, no, no, Mr. Reilly. Sir, no. That would end my career. I... I got... I have a family to support. We have prepared a compensation package, once you sign the right documents. You've already made the call. Client was furious, but the account is still ours if it's all kept outside of the public eye. No. No, this is a goddamn ambush. No! I'll go to the shareholders. I'll go to the press. This is fucking illegal! You are not going to do any such thing. Watch me! Sit down, son. - Fuck you! - Sit down. Let me paint you a picture of what comes next. You ring the bell; you sound the alarm. How do you imagine we will be forced to respond, huh? This man making all these wild claims, is troubled, an alcoholic, gambled himself into serious debt. Perhaps these wild claims are part of a botched blackmail attempt. Perhaps, this man was caught red-handed having an affair? Calls into question the very morality of his beloved family unit, wouldn't you say? You're worried about your career? Take everything of value to you, watch it disappear. Am I making myself clear? Fuck! Stop! Stop! I got money. There's money in the house. Stop. Please. 40 million dollars. Good. The headaches are still laying me out a couple of times a week. The detectives come up with anything? Ah, break-in gone bad, that's it. - You still haven't told anyone. - I can't, Pete. You don't know these people. I pursue this, Chris' career, kids tormented at school, I... I'm supposed to protect them. I'm your doctor, Henry, not your priest. I don't need a priest, Pete. I need a friend. The good news is there's no permanent damage. It's looking good. Give it time, concussions are tricky. With everything we know, what's up here is still a mystery. There's Trevor. Damn, son. Vince is looking tight. Seriously, I would redo sophomore year for one night with Trevor Hall. - Here you go, baby. - Hey, wow. Thank you. Sweet and spicy? Just the way you like it. You ever going to take me out? Ah, listen. Uh, you're a babe, all right. And you know it. Come on, we're getting out of here. Oh, hey, Grace. Hey, Charlotte. Since when do you smoke? A little while now. Okay, because cancer is cool. Don't put that fucking juju on us. Oh, hi by the way. Catty bitches. Wow! - Are we getting out of here? - Hells, yes. Really, have a lovely day. Watch it, fuck nuts. How'd you get on that butthole's radar? Like I had to do anything. Hey, Alice goes to Lansing now, maybe you can transfer. Start over? I'm king of the school. Clay, those trades won't close until the 9th because it's London, right? Yes, and I brought that up at the end of Q2, but nobody was... Mr. Sharpe on line two. Oh, okay. Clay, can you hold for a moment? Thanks. Hey! What did he say? I'm a medical mystery. I don't like mysteries, you headed home? I have to see a couple of headhunters first. Well, maybe you should take it easy, huh? Those projections were spot-on. Mm-hmm. You're brilliant. Lunch is on me today. Um, sweetie, I should run. - Love you. - Yeah, you too. I love the retro thing you've got going, but if you want a boy like Trevor Hall, you got to kick it up a notch. My mom would kill me. Tell me she's not still dressing you. Of course, not. Jeez! Hey, Miguel, Miguel, Miguel. Listen to me. I let you drag me to church every week. I even pretend to listen to his eternal endless servants. So, okay? Go easy on your sinful thoughts. I just want you to listen. I'm listening. Ah! Oh, hey. Tell the Sharpes 2 p.m. on Wednesday. Okay? - Stay out of trouble. - Alright,. Always. Ciao. I've done all research, this is cutting-edge technology. Henry, this is Orwellian. I mean this is like Big Brother stuff. Come on, don't be paranoid. Can we even afford something like this? It's a dry spell. I'll find something. - Hey. - Oh, hey. - Hey, you look nice. - Oh, thank you. - You have fun? - It's good to be home. You need anything? No, sweetie. I'm good. Thanks. Okay. So, I'll just go check on the kids. You know, I'm focused on getting you well and the job and... I will look at the Yelp reviews. Oh, thanks, Mom! Hey, Angela! Okay, I'm coming in. - Hey! - Doesn't anybody knock? I'm rescuing your eardrums, you crazy. What is this, huh? Any good finds? Oh, your father's going to ground you forever. Unless he doesn't find out. Okay, you know what? You pick this place up, chica. I can't vacuum if I can't find the floor. Thank you. You're the best. Ha, my boys, my boys, my baby boys! How are you, huh? How are you? How are you, mi amor? - What I miss, my baby boys? - AFK. Dad thinks we need a new security system. Mom thinks dad needs therapy. It's actually crazy. Easy to pick a lock. Like you even tried. - You tried? - Yeah. B-A-K. Lucia, we're totally killing this guy. Heck, yeah, you are. Okay. Let's go. - Let's go. You got to brush your teeth. - Come on, please. No, no, no. Mama coming. Mike, Mike. Go to bed early tonight, okay? I don't like your baggy eyes. Copy that. - Here you are, the Sharpe family. Welcome. - Thank you. If you could please fill this out. Some of the questions might seem irrelevant, but I assure you they all have significance. - Have a seat. - All right. - You know, when Mr. Branson got robbed... - Yeah. He was knocked upside the head with a DVD combo player, 10 stitches. Did he exhibit positive coping behaviors? What's that? That's a really bad joke, sweetie. Well, I just have to ask, so I know someone did. Isn't this a little extreme? Yeah, like extremely awesome. Okay, guys, look. I know I've been a little bit off lately and I'm sorry that I haven't been as present to you as I should have been, but... this place is the best. And I really need this, yeah, but I need us all on board more. I need us to do this together as a family. So, what do you say? Mr. and Mrs. Sharpe? I'm Helen. We are ready to begin the procedure. Wait, what... what procedure? Oh, it's just a term that we use for implanting the IMP 616 device. I know it sounds scary, but it's really very simple and quick. If you'll all just come with me, we can get started. Our technology is cutting edge, here at our state-of-the-art facility and all the security systems that we'll be installing in your home. Our success rate is, well, out of this world. - Would you care to sit down? - Why... why me? Ladies first. Um... okay. Our transmitter and microchip are atomically synchronized. They communicate through the electrochemical signal on the cellular level to the master control units. So does this make us like cyborgs now? Okay, you know what, sweetie, I don't need to be any more nervous than I already am. It makes you safe. Isn't that what you want? Ow, ow! The blood gives us a tamper-proof DNA baseline. No one else can wear this anklet now. Could I go next? Oh. Okay. All systems ready, Mr. Sharpe. The master control. Do the honors. That's right. See it with your fingers. Shut up. Batman, villain, one of the stoop girls. No, it's not. I haven't seen it yet. - Yes, it is. - Tonight then? It's a stupid Gotham villain where he was blinded and he sees through his fingers. Goodnight. - Kids down? - Yep. - I will be back. - Oh. Well, Henry, it's a banner day and we get to do it together. No complaints, Lou. You really delivered. Well, we've bonded. It's a united front just like your marriage. I've got a lot of years in wedlock too, but I would say they're all happy but no one would believe me. It's about finding the one that you can trust and then making sure that she deserves your trust, but my wife once in a while takes the lead... Never outside the nuptial bedroom, huh? Uh, I hope I'm not overstepping my bounds, but there's none of the strange going on here, right? No, no, nothing at all. Did they ever catch the assailants? I look into my clients, it's good business. Oh, that was just, um... I was the target of something. I haven't told my family about it. Well, it's a damn shame, a good man like you. But, Henry, all accounts can be settled if you have the will to put a full commitment to it. To your wonderful life. What happened? You okay? - Jeez! - Bad dream? Yeah. Yeah. Damn, Mike. Angela is looking hot today. What? Shut up, asshole. Dude, if I wasn't your best friend, I would totally be all over that. Okay, that is my sister and seriously, man. Oh, wait, dude. Watch where you're going, douche. Hey, not cool, Judah. Oh, it's not... it's not cool, Judah. I don't agree, little buddy. You know, why you have to be such a jerk, huh? Oh, so now I'm the jerk? I don't think so, little shit, but if I am, why don't you do something about it? Please. Just come on, let's do something. Teach me a lesson. Maybe instead of picking on a freshman, you could pick up a book unless you want to go through junior year again. Maybe you should mind your own business. He's my brother. This is my business. - Angela. - Oh, yeah. Maybe I'll put you on your back instead, but you'd like that, wouldn't you? Yo, what the fuck did you just say, bro? Trevor, what's up, man? We're just messing around. We're joking, right? Oh, it's hilarious. Why don't you take a walk, man, unless you want coach to hear about this? See you around, little brother. It's good to see you. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Okay, good. - Umm, thanks. I'm gonna go to class. He doesn't talk much, does he? Oh, no, Mike, we call him the silent assassin. Oh, clearly. I'm sorry about that. You know, Judah's always been an asshole. Oh, yeah, that's true. But I really, I had it covered. Oh, I'm sure you did, but you're okay though, right? Yeah, no. Totally. Tip top. - I'll see you around, okay. - Aha. Didn't find anything today? - Dude, they're following us. - Yeah, so. Split up. Oh, hey, guys. Where you going? You like embarrassing me kid, huh? You think that's funny? It's just I didn't do anything to you. Just back off. Yeah, should we back? No. See, I don't think I can do that. Where's the game toy? Oh, there's the game toy. You know, I... I really think that you're going to miss this. Thanks for the workout, shithead. Pick yourself up. Mike! Mike! Mike! Oh, my God! They got you good. Just don't bother, it's trash. We'll send it to Wrecker, you know, he can fix anything. It's broken. No. Thank you. The whole office thanks you. You lift weights? Just cardio, you know. The new cross-fit place on 9th. Well, that new routine is working. Whatever, Steve. Thank you though. Melanie, coffee, please. Sure, Chris. No problem. - All right. - Yeah. We're out of non-dairy creamer, so I used real milk. Is that okay? Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Henry! Henry! Sweetie, I think you're sleepwalking. Girls, stop it. Back to the kitchen, go. I wouldn't mess with you, Mr. S. Hey. Hey, sweetie. I think it was a bad dream. I've been having terrible dreams. I have not been sleeping well at all ever since that we've put this... Please just stop talking. Babe, I'm not mad. I just can't help you if you won't tell me what happened. - I... I got in a fight that's all. - A fight? - You got spanked. - Angela! What's the other guy look like, buddy? Really not helpful, Maggie. Yeah, what's the other guy look like, Mike? Not like this. Exactly, the weak get destroyed. It's natural selection. - But there were three... - Three? Okay. I need names. The school needs to know, so do these parents. No, mom. No, please just... Not a smart kid, Chris, no. Nobody likes a tattletale. Yeah, just move it over. Make friends. Better yet, make friends with the football team. - Can I be excused? - No. Yes, buddy, go. We're going to go study. Thanks, Mr. S, Mrs. S. We're raising a man of action, Chris, not a coward. Is Mike in trouble? No, sweetie. Where did everybody go? I need a mental health day. So I found a job, sales thing working from home. Okay, sounds good. I know what you're going to say, one voice with the kids. I know. I know, but Mike needs to learn how to stand up for himself. I mean, I... I don't want him being taken advantage of like... Henry, Henry, like what? Those guys didn't come after you. You came home at the wrong time. It was lousy luck. You're still seeing Pete tomorrow? Pete. Yeah, why? I think you need to ask him if you're having side effects to that medication. Fine. Oh, you want to try it? Just don't wear a two piece this summer. And go dateless my whole high school career? There are other ways to land a boy. Oh, my God! You're such a whore. You love it. Have you ever wondered what a crash would feel like? No. Why? You want to find out? Oh, my God! Maggie! Would you stop this? You are so scared. Oh, my God! Not true. Well, you're afraid of something. The inevitable. The slow accumulation of boredom until it just becomes my life. Okay. Oh, my God! Maggie, turn lights back on. Oh, my gosh. You're not bored anymore? Oh, my God! What's wrong with you? Turn them on. - It's so dark I can't see a thing. - Maggie! Oops. Oh, gosh. We got to toughen you up. Those college bitches will have your vag for brunch. Damn that looks so good. Take your time, no need to rush. Just do your job, dude. Yes, Ma'am. Now, watch closely. You never see my fingers leave my hand. How's that? - It's been business doing pleasure with you. - Whatever. Chris tells me you're having bad dreams, night sweats, you're sleepwalking, irritable, drinking a lot. Oh, come on, Doc. I'm fine, never better. - There's nothing to report. - You sure? I'm only here 'cause Chris put this on the books. She's worried about you, Henry. And so am I. You want to tell me what's going on down there? Yeah, yeah, yeah. The latest in-home security systems, okay. This thing is next-gen IoT level shit, right here. I lock the door at night, I sleep like a baby. But you're not Henry, that's the point. Look, you want to build an underground safe house, knock yourself out. I'm assuming those things transmit and receive a signal, right? Sure. Wi-Fi can mess with your sleep patterns. That's why you're not supposed to put a router in your bedroom. Do me a favor, check with the manufacturers, see if they have any data on signal strength and any side effects it could cause. - Will you do me that favor? - Of course, sure. I'm serious, Henry. Whatever you say, Doc. I know you're there. I can hear you. Yes. Hey, it's Henry Sharpe here from applied office... Sir, there's no need to be so angry. No, I... I do not know how you got on this list. I'm just trying to do my job. - Hello, Mrs. Shape. - Oh, my God! Oh, the boys. Oh, I think I need a key card. Ugh. Yes, no, there. - Ooh, wow! - So sorry. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. - It's my fault. - So intense. - Yeah. - Sorry. We never gave Miguel a key card. - Oh. - You really hooked it up, Mr. Sharpe. Yeah, yeah. It's all hooked up. Uh, I'll get started on the yard. Sorry. What? All right! So, what if I shave off another 10% on this deal? Fantastic, yes. Okay. All right. Thank you so much, Mrs. Alberts. No, no, no, no. You have a great day. Hey, hey, hump day, right? Look, I can probably lock in that discount, but it's got to be quantity, 80. All right, then. That's 80 laptops. There, now that wasn't bad, was it? No, as a matter of fact that was pretty simple. You know, I don't know why those two sneaks didn't do this themselves instead of throwing all that money away... I'm... I'm going to go to bed. Well, I don't know why they didn't do it either, but I don't know why you're so mad at them. Just finishing this. I'll be up in a bit. You were willing to have them do it for free. Well, that's different. One's charity and one's friendship. - Okay. - Besides do you realize that if they hadn't spent all that money on Joel, they could have spent it on us? You're right. They are a couple of sneaks. Oh, you read my mind. Hmm, just doing my job. - I love this. - Oh, it's a classic. You know, I'm not going to eat this on my own. Damn, turn it on. Okay, I'm gonna help you. Turn it on, man. What you yelling about? Turn off the water, we're leaving. I can't turn it off. This handle just broke off when I turned the pump on. Find anything you like? Not really my style. Get back into the dressing room, please. - No way. - Get back into the dressing room. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I... I have... I have a medical condition. - I really, I can't control it. - You know how many excuses I've heard in my line of work? My parents are expecting me at home, so. Mistake. I forgot. I didn't mean to. An accident. Seven billion people in this world. Same repetitive insulting excuses. So go on. Wow me. If my parents find out... please. Let's see if this was worth stealing. I'm sorry. Good little angel is maybe not so good anymore? That shit tattoo. Now you're skipping school for a career in petty thefts? Try them on for me or I call the cops. Mr. Sharpe, what a surprise. We didn't expect to see you here. I was wondering if you have some more information on the IMP system. What kind of information? Ah, technical specs, I guess, that kind of thing. I'm having a bit of trouble sleeping and my doctor thinks it could be the anklet, maybe the Wi-Fi signal or something. I can assure you, Mr. Sharpe, that the IMP 616 is a state of the art... Of course, but do you have any literature on the mechanics of the... Oh, I'm sorry. You didn't get a brochure. Yeah, I got the brochure, but I'm looking for something a little more comprehensive maybe. That's the only information that we have available. The IMP 616 is patented, and a highly guarded industry secret. You can imagine how many people would die to get their hands on our technology. In the future, I would recommend calling the office first for an appointment. I did call. Yeah, and nobody answered. Have a nice day. - Hey. - Hey, did you speak to Barclays yet? No, why? The Trident Trade dispersion closed yesterday. Oh, shit, shit, shit. - I totally missed that. - Look, what if I fudge the dates? People go to jail for that. Only if they get caught. I... I'd risk it. I'd risk it for you. Oh, Liam. Stop. Okay, stop. Let me do this for you. You want to do something for me, find something for Henry. I... I need him back in the game. I'm not sure that's appropriate. Maybe the next kiss wouldn't be such a surprise. Oh, Christine. What the fuck are you doing? - Hey. - Hey. How was your day? Uh, long. I'm going to take a shower. Christine. What's your rush? Man, work was something else. Yeah, maybe you should ease off? What? Yeah. Cut your hours back. Plan your exit strategy. Are you drunk? The kids need you here, Chris. I need you here. We need you present. Oh, you mean like you used to be? - No. - What? Hey, hey, hey. This was all decided. Why do we have to make this all about me? Come on, Henry. Things change, right? Things change, decisions are made, now we just have to live with it. Oh, what decisions? Well, you made choices and you didn't ask my opinion and you didn't talk to me and you didn't ask what I thought? What? Like what? What? What? What decisions are we talking about? You could have taken medical leave after the assault. You could have done. You could have talked to me and you would have found out that I'm not the person you married and you're not the person I married and now I'm paying the mortgage and you're selling office furniture. Oh, and when did you become such a bitch? You know what, you don't get to fucking talk to me like that. So, if you're not the person I married, who exactly are you? You know what, you know exactly - who the fuck I am is what I'm saying. - Really? I'm not having this fight, Henry. I'm not doing this. No, you're not. You're not having this fight. I'm not having this fight because you're the one who feels guilty and I'm the one who's being made to pay for it. Henry, nobody took anything from you, you gave it up. I don't want to do that. Henry? Henry? I found the mountain, Your Majesty! I found it. It was like a mad mountain. It... it was this big. No, it was this big. It was as big, as big, as big... as... as... Mr. Sharpe When I get my men group up, just look out. But, Glory... Don't look down, gentlemen, when it's on. Oh, my God! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh, dude. There they are. Ready to run? What in the world do you think you're doing right now? - I got a plan. - Oh, great. We're for sure, dead. Hey! - What do you want? - Protection and I'll pay you for it. So, 50 bucks? I could get more. We got a deal? - What a fucking loser? - Judah. You're not going to... We got a deal. Protection. Don't worry about it. - Right? - Yeah, sure thing. Dude, what just happened? Where did you get that cash? Savings, worth every penny. Oh, my God! You're like invincible now. Who would've thought? Some baller you are. I'll catch you later. Invincible? My ass. Let's make it last, all right? - You ain't got to tell me twice. - Yeah. I got your pie, gorgeous. Wow, thank you so much. - Hey, Trevor. - Hey, what's up, Angela? - Nice hair. I like it. - Thanks. Are you coming to Maggie's party? Yeah, of course. I would never miss it. Cool. So, can I have a slice? Yeah, sure. There you go. - I'll catch you later. - Bye. If you don't back the fuck off, I will end your wannabe hippie life. Is that a joke? All I have to do is drain your brake fluid. You're crazy! And you're leaving. Next time send another drop out wannabe loser. So you... you gave the... you gave the printer a good whack? Yes, I tried everything. - Mrs. Anderson. - Yes. Yeah, printers don't fix themselves. Okay. So, when will she be back from maternity leave? Okay. Why don't you get her to give me a call when she pops, okay? Thanks. So with advancements in science and technology also comes a more increased threat. Especially for losers. Good one, Judah. Um, which... which may... which makes the need for good security, um, all the more important. And profitable. Okay, Judah. That's enough. Hey, wait. Wait. Stop. Stop. Stop. Mike. Mike. Mike! I can't push the button. Oh, fuck. Hello. Hello, Mr. Apear. Yeah, I just want to let you know that that deal I was gonna give you on the office chairs, that's now off the table. Mr. Chan, Henry Sharpe. Wanted to let you know you have no idea how to run a fucking office. You think you can fix a printer by banging on it? Who are you? The Hand of God? I tell you what, why don't you lay down in the street and wait to fucking die. Oh, my God! I'm sorry. I decided... Come on before someone calls the guidance counselor. Hey, Mr. Muhammad. What's going on over there. Yeah, numbers, Sir. I got to tell you numbers are right up this week. Yeah. She said you were harassing the customers. She said what? No, it must have been a bad connection. No, Mr. Muhammad, I got a clean record of every call that I... You're fired. Fuck! Melanie, you're fired. Got you! I got you. Who wants what? You training for the coronary Olympics? No smart talk, Angela. You're not my mom, Lucia. Okay, Lucia. Thank you. I have this. Angela, you're already in the doghouse and you better tell me what happened to that hand or you're eating double helpings of this. - I'll have hers. - Me too, me too. That's the spirit boys. Lucia, wine. Halfsies for anybody ever 10. What? Oh, come on, Chris. What's going to hurt? My pride and joy, I can't tell you how happy I am to have us all together. Oh, a well-cooked steak tastes like carbon. Why... why would you cook a steak like this? Why would you cook 30 steaks like this? Rare steak is a breeding ground for disease. I'm just looking after you, Chris. Oh, wow. Keep looking because I'm not eating this. I'll make you a new one, Mrs. Sharpe. It'll take me a minute. I paid good money for that steak. You're eating it or nobody eats. Make me. No one's leaving this house. Nice going, Dad. Mike, daddy's got a headache. Why don't you boys take it upstairs? Are you ready? For an evening of tax incentives and derivatives, couldn't think of anything better. I'll get us out early. I know you want to prep the week's leads. Oh, I forgot to tell you. I got fired. Good evening. Thank you. - Celia, hi. - Oh, hi, Christine. - How are you? - Good. - So glad you could join us. - Thank you for having us. - Do you remember my husband, Henry? - Oh, I do. Welcome. - Thank you. - Have some champagne and a lovely time. - Thank you. - This one for you. Thank you. Ah. I've been beckoned. Hey! Hey! Good to see you. - Thank you. - Good. - Good evening, Sir. - Hey, champ. She'll have a white wine and I'm looking for something a little more high-test. Commander knows what he wants and how to ask for it. They have a special bottle held back for your host's discerning guests. That's what I'm talking about. Let's make that a double and save on the ice. You got it. All fixed up, Sir. To us and those like us. It's an interesting toast. You've... you served, Sir? No, not in the traditional sense, no. But every day is a battle, is it not? A soldier without a war, perhaps, it's time you join the fray. Hate to miss out on all the fun. Hey, bitch! Oh, my God! You look so good. Oh, my God! Thank you. So do you. I am so wasted. Oh, my God! I want to be. Can you get me a drink? - Yes. - I want to get trashed. So, what are we drinking to? Tears all that wishes well and all the rest can go to hell. Okay. I'll protect this city with my life. Now I'm Bruce Wayne. I would like to thank you for joining my lovely wife Celia and I for this wonderful celebration. This has been a banner year for Hillside Cabin. We weathered the storm like a crew of crusty seamen. So... relax and enjoy. I'm so sorry! What the hell are you doing here? - It was Mike's idea, I swear. - Mike, he's here, too? He's the bag of bones, over there in the corner. How's the job hunt going, Henry? Yeah, I'm trying on a couple of things in sales. Henry got fired. My life is awash with opportunities. Well, I'd believe that with this lovely woman by your side. Oh, save the lines for the girls, Liam. That's not a line, Christine. Christine asked me to put my feelers out. I spoke with Harry and, well, there's interest there. What do you say? Ready to dive right back in? Liam, if you want to fuck my wife it would be more courtesy to ask my permission first. - What? I feel like that's a valid request. - Okay, I think we should leave. Oh, no. No, we haven't even had the digestif. - Let's leave. - Oh! Hey, thanks, Celia. That was a great spread. - Save me a cup of the fucking flan, will you? - Okay. - Sorry. I think he's... he's not feeling well. - Captain. Thank you so much. Maggie, too cool for your own party? Liquor store closes in 15. What the hell, Angela? Wrong way. What the hell was the point? You couldn't stand the fact that I was the one getting attention for a change? God, I think I'm going to be sick. I would do anything for you and now you're nothing but a dirty fucking antidote. You're insane. Fuck do you know? I know how this ends. How much more could you fucking embarrass me? I mean, we actually need my job, - you know that, right? - You offered me up like a sack of rice. Come on, Liam had the whole thing set up. All you have to do is just give him your details and... There's no more jobs in finance, okay? None. Not ever again. Why, Henry? Why not? What... what... what are you not telling me? - Hello. - Hello, I'm calling from the hospital. Mr. and Mrs. Sharpe, I'm Dr. Campbell. Angela's in surgery. What happened? She's brought in with a young lady, her passenger. - Angela wasn't wearing her seatbelt. - No, no. There's no way. There's no way. - We'll know more in a little while. - Oh, my God. Oh, my poor baby. Dr. Flores dial 112, please. Dr. Flores dial 112. What did you do? You had an accident, Maggie. You're okay. They're... they've called your parents. And Angela. They don't know yet. What happened? I just wanted to go to the store. But... there's something wrong with Angela. - What do you mean? - She tried doing it before and her hand was all cut up. I didn't think that she... Maggie, you've had an accident, so you're not thinking clearly. She did it on purpose, Mrs. Sharpe. She wants to kill herself and she tried to kill me. You shut your fucking mouth. You hear me? Now, Angela made it through surgery, but she's in a coma. Chris. Christine! I'm sorry, she's... she's very upset. I have to go. Chris. What are you doing here? You're okay? Chris? Alrighty. Go to bed. Where's Angela? Angela. No. Henry, it's Lou. Are you there? She's dying. Set yourself up a tall drink, Henry. I... did you hear me? I hear you. There's nothing wrong with my ears. Set yourself up a tall drink. There's nothing in the house. Under the sink behind the bleach. Feeling better? Now talk to me. Are you with the missus? No, she... she left me at the hospital. She drove away. Boy, you have drawn the short straw with that woman. How she expects a hard-working man like you to shoulder this burden all alone? Beyond me. No, no, no, no, no. It's not her fault. Oh, whose fault is it, Henry? The man unknown? This is the kind of action that deserves stiff punishment. I know what I would do, but if you feel someone else is more deserving, go right ahead. We're both cut from the same cloth, Henry. We're men of action. You have everything right there in front of you. There you go. They destroyed me, but that wasn't good enough for you, was it? - Please, I don't know what you're talking about. - No, well, you had your turn. Now it's mine. I want to talk numbers. - Anything. - Really? 40 million dollars. 40 million. You're insane. I know you got it. Brandon Reilly takes care of his clients. - After all what's good for the company... - Brandon Reilly? No, I work for the SEC. - I'm investigating him. - Liar. Daddy! Oliver, stay where you are, son. Please, I'm telling you the truth. Get off me. Ugh! Dad, I'm going to... CEO. Oh, that one almost hit the... didn't even leave the driveway. So you didn't get touched last week, right? Well, that's cause I'm invincible. What planet are you from? Unreal? Say, my money's real enough. True that, CEO. Here. Oops. Hurry, get in the car. No, no, no, Lucia. No, we can't do this. Chris? Where is she, huh? I'll always be here for you. Listen. Listen to me... I can give you the life you've always wanted, the life you deserve. I want it too, all of it. Everything. You're not my wife. You never will be my wife. No, no, no, Lucia. No, come here.. No, please.. No, stop.. No! Are you going to invite us in? Who the fuck are you people? - You aren't in your right mind. - What did you do to us? Let me help you. We just gave you what you asked for. Who are you? Your clients. We have an exclusive clientele. Which half of this deadly couple... couple Oh, my God! Someone you know? They murdered their own daughter, daughter, daughter... No, no. You fucking come near me and I will cut her fucking throat. Do you hear me? That picture, you're going to take that down and give it to me. It's too late, Mrs. Sharpe. There's nothing that you or your family can do. You can't have us. Henry... you've come a long way since the first time I graced your door. You're a fine man and as I have seen, you're a great salesman. Head of sales, profit participation, salary, room to grow, all of it. What do I have to do? The question really is do you have the courage to do what has to be done? Henry, we need to talk. Where'd you find that? The murder-suicide, do you remember? Look who's with them, Henry. He's not human. These anklets they are doing something to us. We got to take these anklets off. I know you'd try and destroy this opportunity. Why not quit on us? Quit on the family. Quit on our benefactor. Benefactor? What are you talk.... we don't have... And now it's too late. No, it's not too late. It's not too late. Henry, it's not too late. I love you. I love you. You sleep with him? Did you? Oh, what a pair? Disaster of a husband and a fucking whore. Okay. I'm taking the kids with or without you. I understand. Take Lucia, too. She's in the office. I'll get the boys ready. Lucia. Lucia. Lucia. Hola. Hola. This is Lucia. You know what to do and I'll call you back. Mike. Sam. Sam. Sam. Sam. Mike. Mike. Sam. Angela's never coming home. She's going to die in there. Henry, what did you do? I want a divorce. What did you do? This is the time of vengeance and no life is worth saving and I will put in the grave as many as I can. It's time for me to kill and it's time for me to die. Dad. Hey, Sam. Come here. Come here. Where's mom? Well, mom's not feeling very well, pal. Hey, how about you help me pick out a winner? What do you think? Huh? Point to the one you like. I can't see which one you're pointing at, buddy. Come over here. Come and show me. That's it. Come here, Sam. Sam, come to daddy. - Mom? - Go to bed. Now! Your father needs you. Mike. Hola. Hola. This is Lucia. You know what to do. Mike. Lucia. Miguel. Miguel. - Lucia. - Miguel. - Lucia. - Miguel. - What's going on in there? - Miguel. Miguel. He's crazy. - What's going on in there, Lucia? - Miguel. Miguel. It's my first day, how about a little bit of support? Aha. Christine. Sweetie, open the door. - Open the door, sweetie. - Stay the fuck away from me. Open the goddamn motherfucking door. - No! - Shh, shh, shh. Shh! Okay. It's better this way. It's better. Lucia! Lucia! Where are you? This is family business. This is not you, Henry. I know this isn't you. Oh! Mom. Oh, baby. Baby, here. Okay. I want you to take this and go back to your room, okay? You're going to take it and you're just going to hide in your room. - Okay. - No, mom, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby. It's going to be okay. You take this and you just swing it at anybody that comes that isn't me, okay? You just be brave for a little bit and I'll be right there. Okay, you go. Go, go, go. In your room, Sam. Go to your room. I think you need a timeout. You're ruining everything. Okay. Mike, babe, you're not well and your dad's not well. We need to get you to a doctor. He's not sick. You're hurting him. I'm not hurting him and I know what it looks like. I'm not hurting him. You're just... you're just a bully girl. You're all just fucking bullies. I'm try... Put the bat down, baby. Put the bat down. It's my time. - No, no, no! - No! Ah! - That's it, my good boy. - Come here. Come here. It's not you. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. I warned him about you. That's the problem with these kids, too many variables. No! I'm sorry. - Henry. Henry. - Hey, it's okay. It's over, right? Mike, you got to go. You're the man of the house. Get them all out. Get these boys. Go, go. For the murders of Lucia Perez, Liam Christensen, and a yet to be identified John Doe and for the brutal assaults of Christine Sharpe and Miguel Perez, we are asking our listeners to please call the police hotline if you have any information on the whereabouts of Henry Sharpe who remains missing and is presumed armed and dangerous. Content? You're in pretty deep with the authorities, but your family is snug as a bug and will remain so on my honor. All right, time to make it official. You're the client. Mr. Reilly brought you to my attention with that stupid idea of a snow job. He's a terrible liar. Anyway, in my field of work, you could call that a lucky break. You sent people to hurt me. Yeah, you needed a little push. My associate who bled out on your bedroom floor, that was his specialty, the push. There's a whole world of souls out there who need their own little push. Why me? Why... why you? Because I like you. You're true management material. Well, hello, there. What can I do for you? Actually, Ma'am, it's more what I can do for you. Exactly how happy are you with your current home security provider? Subtitles by explosiveskull
