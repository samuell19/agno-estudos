What brings you here, Jin? Damn! How did you know it was me? No one can move these heavy status but you... Mighty God Jin. Magic Thief Fei never leaves empty-handed. Since you've been to the house of Chang the millionaire... you must have his pearl with you. Now that you're here, I guess I have to turn the pearl over to you. It's too early to say. What? You want this pearl too? Of course not. I've heard you're a betting man... so I'd like to wager my head to win that pearl from you. Fine. What shall we bet on? Whether I can move those statues back or not. YOU? I'll bet with you, though your head is useless to me. You're so short and weak. If you can move them back... you'll win not only the pearl but my head too. Okay. Deal! Stone Lions, you look so ferocious... but you can't even guard the door. What a shame! You should be punished. I only said I'd move them back. I didn't say how. Are you going to throw in the towel now... or do you want to see me move them back piece by piece? No need for that. I shouldn't be betting with the Iron-Palm Stone Monkey to begin with. Then the pearl is mine, right? Yes, of course. Damn! You tricked me. I'll admit defeat, if you can catch me. Ghost Shadow! Whose pearl is it now? Yours. - None of you wants it? - We don't want it. Then I'll take it. If any of you wants a rematch, just come look for me. How come he had to show up? Because one misfortune always rides upon another's back. If it weren't for your help, we would have been robbed. We're immensely grateful to you, Mei. Here's something to show our deep appreciation. Let's go. We know we were wrong and we know the punishment. We'll see to it ourselves. Good. You finally made it. I bring the payment to redeem my life. Will it be enough to redeem your life for another year? Please take a look. That must be Chang's pearl. I wouldn't bring it to you if it wasn't good enough. - Have you killed anyone this year? - No. - Have you committed any evil deeds? - No. Then I'll grant you another year. Thank you, Mei. I promise I'll repent and start anew. You'd better mean what you say, or I'll never forgive you. Yes. You can stop hiding in the tree, my friend. Is that the priceless pearl? May I take a look? Of course. Go ahead. You can't kill me. You have to keep your word. If you kill me, you will die too. I know, but you've destroyed my payment. You have to compensate me. I Will. How can you afford to? I don't have a pearl like that... because even my smallest one is quite a bit larger. It's not for you. Of course. It's for him. If you want, you can have them all. There must be strings attached. What do you want from me? I want to see what's under the wok. - You really want to know? - I really want to know. You can use your kung fu to kill anyone in an instant. Killing a man is nothing. Sparing a man's life... That's something. Is that the famous Killer Meteor? That's right. Rumor has it your Killer Meteor is incredibly powerful. Do you know of anyone who has ever seen its power? No, no one. I myself have only seen it twice. That means only two others have seen its power besides you... and both of them are dead. You know, someone is going to die because of you. - Who? - Me. YOU? If I can't bring you to Celestial House before July 15th, I will die. Somehow you indirectly contribute to my death. Who wants to kill you? Another meteor in the martial arts world. Devil Meteor, Hua the Hearty. Hua the Hearty? Who else? I've always wanted to meet him. I'll go with you. I'm not going. I'd rather not meet the devil. Excuse me. Only Devil Meteor can scare Ghost Shadow like that. This way, please. Don't you think it's nice to eat out here? This is how you live? I don't see anything wrong with it. I can eat and sleep whenever I want. I'm completely free. You'd rather sleep in the wild than stay at the inn. Why should I do that? I love nature. And you'd rather cook by yourself than eat in a tavern. There are at least 3,000 edible things around us. That's more than enough for me. Why bother going to a tavern? You're full of excuses. I know why you live this way. Really? You don't want your enemies to learn your whereabouts... and you cook your own food to avoid being poisoned. Though I know you don't kill innocent people... I also know you have at least 500 enemies. You're wrong. That should be 491. You keep very precise count. Unfortunately, none of them can give me the fight I'm looking for. No one dares challenge you unless they want to die. Stop trying to flatter me. Perhaps you've really come to kill me. I wouldn't dare try. Actually, I need you to do me a favor. You? What do you want? I can't stand seeing you live this way. Let me treat you to a nice meal. Very well. I'll make an exception this time. Very good. Here's your order. Here's your wine. This sword cost me 3,000 silver pieces and 20 bottles of fine wine. What do you think? It's a good sword. I don't think so. What? Your sword is better than mine? Mine can't compare with yours... but somebody else's can. Whose? Our guest tonight, Fong the Wind Chaser. Fong? I'm only talking about the sword itself... not its owner's skill. That's right. Your sword is better than his. But remember... his skill can turn a simple piece of metal into a weapon. Right. There's no match for him in that regard. Master Fong has arrived. - Thank you for coming. - My pleasure. This way, please. - Please be seated. - Thank you. Master, I didn't know you were here... Don't bother me. Go back to your friends. Yes. Who is that? Why do you humble yourself before him? It's not your place to inquire about him! May I know your name? My name means nothing to you. Why did the famous Wind Chaser call you master? Why do you have to know? Actually, I already know. Fong's master really admired you. You are Qing, the famous Blue-Robed Swordsman... who vanquished the three hero who were Fong's masters. That was 10 years ago. But what has changed now? Now I am just a servant to Hua the Hearty. A servant? What could have made the famous Qing become someone's servant? Hua the Hearty is the Devil Meteor. What kind of person he is? You'll know when you see him. Unless you meet him, you can never understand. - Please wait for me here. - As you wish. Master Mei. The master is ill and can't come out to receive you. Please come with me. I'll show you in. Please wait here. Master, I've brought Mei here. So you are Mei. You wouldn't have me here if I wasn't Mei... and I wouldn't come except on your account. Unfortunately, Hua the Hearty isn't feeling very hearty... or I would have gone out to welcome you myself. How can Hua the Hearty be sick? Just as rich people like to pretend to be poor... sick people like to pretend they're healthy. Hasn't that always been the case everywhere? You have a point. Why did you want to see me? Why? Because I want to kill you. Well done. You can all go. Even Qing's attack couldn't force you to use your Killer Meteor. No offense. You may want to kill me but I don't want to kill you. I only use the Killer Meteor when necessary. I don't really want to kill you. I want you to save me. If you can weather his attack, then you can save me. What if I can't? In that case you would be of no use to me... and I wouldn't care whether you lived or died. That's one good thing about you: You're very straightforward. That's why I deserve to live. How can I save you? I want you to kill someone for me. Who? My wife. You really are sick. Otherwise you wouldn't ask me to kill your wife. I have not always been in this condition. I fell sick when I ate the ginseng soup my wife prepared for me. The soup was poisoned? Why would she want to poison you? Because she's a tramp. She likes all kinds of men. Well, then, why are you still alive? I am still of use to her... due to my great wealth and my kung fu. No one will dare harm her as long as I am alive... including myself, if I want to stay alive. I don't understand. Master Mei, she alone has the antidote. The master needs to take that once a year. I have to do whatever she says to get it. That's really hard to imagine. You are the only one who can kill her and get the antidote. She likes men, and you are an excellent specimen. There are all kinds of men around her. And they all know kung fu? Very well. Four of them are her favorites. They guard the antidote all the time. One is called Blazing Star. His weapon is Plum Blossom Needles. He never misses. Another is called Killer Hands... Watch out for their fierce suction. Don't bother to check. I got their eyes, didn't I? Yes. You're very good. Let's roast them. I could use a little snack. Black Lama is good at black magic. Taoist Ghost is full of cunning tricks. They commit all kinds of notorious crimes... and no one can do anything because of their kung fu skills. I've heard of them. Are they the ones I have to kill to get to the antidote? They're not the ones you need to worry about. - Who, then? - My wife, Madam Hua. I can imagine. - Do you dare do it? - There's nothing I don't dare to do. If you help me, I'll reward you handsomely. That's not necessary. I'm not doing this for you. Then why are you doing it'? Because I feel like it. Master Mei. What? Wouldn't you like Hua the Hearty to be your friend? Mei doesn't make friends. Besides, what you have are servants, not friends. Whether you consider me your friend or not... I have something else to tell you. Please come here. He's yours now. Do whatever you wish with him. Let's go. Who's that? Hold it. Who are you? - What do you want? - Why are you here so late? Because I feel like it. Were you in a fight'? Who did this to you? What? It's none of your business. Seems you're a troublemaker. - Seize him! - Let's go. Is it done? Yes, all the prisoners have been transferred to the dungeon. Good. - Be careful. I'm leaving now. - Yes. Show Lee in. Your Excellency. Did you take care of everything as I ordered? Yes, sire. We have 63 prisoners. I've transferred all to the dungeon but the new man. How badly was he hurt? He took a lot of kicks and punches... but there's no internal damage. I see. Are you sure you're the only one who knows about this? I drugged the 63 prisoners and transferred them to the dungeon. They won't come to until tomorrow morning. I did all this myself. No one else knows about it. Well done. You will be rewarded. - Here is your reward. - Thank you, Your Excellency. Open the gate. - Sorry I have to put you through this. - I'm used to trouble. Bring me the wine. I am glad to see Hua the Hearty did his part and beat you up. Let's celebrate. Here's to you. I get beaten up and you want to celebrate? Why not? - Leave us alone. - Yes, sir. If Hua beat you up, that means he trusts you. He wants you to do something for him, so he had to beat you up first. Otherwise people would be suspicious. It's a ruse that has never failed since ancient times. You're a very smart man. No wonder people say you're so cunning. You're not bad yourself. I never thought Hua would ask me to kill his wife. Kill Madam Hua? Why? To save his own life. Madam Hua is surrounded by experts in kung fu... and she knows kung fu herself. If you manage to kill her, Hua will trust you completely. Then our plan will work. Are you sure Hua is your suspect? Yes, there's no one else. We just don't have the evidence yet to prove it. Killing him won't solve the case. If you can find one of the seven treasures... stolen from the imperial palace at Hua's place... then we can charge him. It doesn't sound easy. That is why I want you to work on this case. Hua may be smart... but he'll never suspect that you are our detective. For the past three years... you've worked very well as an undercover agent... and solved 19 major cases. But this time not only do I have to deal with Hua... but with his beautiful and evil wife as well. It's true his Devil Sword has yet to meet its match. However... your Killer Meteor has never been defeated either. You can defeat him easily as long as you have his trust. Have you ever trusted anyone? No. That's why I'm still around. If you trust no one... why are you putting me on such an important case? You're different. You're not just anybody. You're my best agent. Not only do I trust you... but I'll also give you my most precious possession. Take good care of yourself. Your leader has been transferred to another location. I have questioned this prisoner and he's innocent. Hold him for the night and release him tomorrow. Yes, sir. Look who's here. Moon Breeze? Why are you here? You didn't know, did you? Don't be surprised. How could I not be surprised to see you here? The most precious possession my father said he would give you... is me. I like you a lot, but I... This mission is very dangerous. If I should... Don't speak. I just want you to remember me. Moon Breeze is yours. I love you. You are free to go. Of course I am. Or is getting beaten up a crime these days? Could you please spare some change? I haven't eaten for three days. I'm no better off than you. How about you lending me some money? - Sir, you must be kidding. - I'm not kidding. - Please give me some change. - Leave me alone. Please, I haven't eaten for days. Go away. I said, go away. Hurry! Help! They're here. Go take a look. Help me! Shut up or I'll throw you in the river. I'll shut up. Looks like Hua chose the wrong man. Mei turns out to be pretty harmless. - Let him out. - Very well. Why were you in there? What happened? I'm sorry. It's all my fault. Get out of here before I kill you. Thank you, Lady Phoenix. Who's that? Over there. I may be harmless... but you're nothing but a pretty bird yourself. Who are you? I'm the one you've been waiting for. Your Phoenix Dart is a worthless toy. Get him! You ladies can't stop me, so don't bother trying. - What do you want? - I know Hua the Hearty sent you. Madam Hua looks on you as a friend... but you don't feel the same way. What else do you know? What else should I know? You should know I'm the only one who can take you to her... and help you get the job done. What concern is it of mine whether this job gets done or not? Of course it's your concern. If this job is not carried out, you're a dead man. Hua will kill you if you fail. Looks like I better do as you say then. From now on, you are my servant. Every man around me is my servant. So Madam Hua won't be suspicious about your new servant. That's the only way to get you there. I have to be your servant to save Hua's life. It's up to you. Don't worry. I promise I'll be the perfect servant. You'd better listen to me or you won't get the antidote. The antidote for Hua is inside this box. Place this over there. Yes, ma'am. I know he'll send someone to try and get it. You must be on your guard. Don't worry. His men won't leave here alive. The more, the better! Right. We'll take care of them. We'll kill them all. That's right. We'll kill them all. I'm afraid this might be someone you can't handle. Impossible. Let him send a three-headed monster... We'll take care of it. Right. Don't be too sure. Besides, have you forgotten today is your day off? We don't need a day off as long as Madam stays with us. Shut up! You dare tell me what to do? No, no. That's not what I meant. I was just hoping you'd stay here with us. I'm not in the mood today. Step down. Yes. I know if you don't chase after women... your hands won't be steady when it's time to kill. That's why you should take tonight off. Madam. What if someone sneaks in and takes the box? Takes the box? Even if that person should get in this cave... he won't be able to open these cages. Even if he manages to open them, he'll still have to contend with me. Do you think my kung fu is inferior to yours? Your kung fu is the best. Not really... but I can always destroy the box in case of emergency. Just go and have a good time. Thank you, madam. We're almost there. You have to be careful once we get there. Yes, ma'am. I know the antidote is kept inside a black box... and locked in a safe place. Guards watch it day and night. If Madam Hua destroys that box, Hua will die. I understand. I won't let that happen. It's almost dark. Go with me to that tavern. We'll have some wine to drink. A tavern? What business can they have in the middle of nowhere? This is a special tavern. They don't care about business. Remember, no matter what happens... don't move and don't speak. Yes. Be sure you do as I say. Yes. I have everything planned. If you spoil things, don't blame me. Yes. - You are very obedient. - How could your servant not obey? And how does Master Mei like being a servant so far? I feel... honored and privileged. - You're just saying that. - Yes. - Shall we go? - Yes. "Rain Blossom Tavern." It's Lady Phoenix. No wonder the birds are singing. Please come in. Where did you learn to flatter like that? I know what Madam likes to eat. I'll have the cook prepare it for you. I forgot I am a servant, and a servant mustn't sit down. - You'd better remember that. - Yes, my lady. I didn't know you'd be coming here tonight. Why? Am I not welcome? Of course. You are always welcome. It's a great honor to have Lady Phoenix here. I dare not dream of such great fortune. Then what did you mean? Did you mean I shouldn't come here tonight? Who would dare say such a thing? It's just that tonight, you know... Tonight the whole place is reserved... and we shouldn't have come? No, that's not what I meant. It's just that Madam Hua's men are coming tonight. It might be best if you weren't here. I've crossed paths with those devils before! I'd like to see them try and touch me! Innkeeper! Boss, the girls are here. Show them in. Please come in. We'll make ourselves at home. Please sit down. What do you want to eat? - I'll have noodles. - I'd like some buns. You can come out now. I'll just pretend I didn't see you. Lady Phoenix will pretend she didn't see us. What a sense of humor! Go keep them company. I haven't seen you for days. Where have you been? I can draw you to me whether you like it or not. See? You may draw me to you, but you can't make me like you. - Is Taoist Ghost the only one you like? - What? Why shouldn't she like a ghost like me? You are a ghost and I am human. I am afraid of you, so you can have your way. Please. People don't understand why I like only you, Taoist Ghost. Unfortunately, he can't become a ghost until he dies. He's not dead. He's not dead yet. If you really prefer ghosts, I can turn him into one. I'll make you a ghost first! He's a ghost now. Do you like him? It's time to teach you a lesson, Black Lama. Are you crazy? You're just a servant! Are you crazy? Why are you waiting to attack? I'm not crazy enough to fight Killer Meteor. You know who I am. Looks like you don't want to live up to your name, Taoist Ghost. Have you forgotten your promise? No, I haven't... but a servant still has the right to do what he likes. What else do you plan to do? I want to... spank you I dare you. - Put me down! - Well done. Put me down! - Do you want me to spank you too? - No, thank you. You're too smart to be a ghost. - I want you to take me to someone. - As you wish. First find a rope and put it around your neck. Then take me there. Put it around my neck? - Why did you stop? - We're there. "Rain Blossom Cave." Move! Madam, there's a man outside who wants to see you. - Who is it? - I don't know. But he has Taoist Ghost on a leash and he's carrying Lady Phoenix. He must be an amusing man. Show him in. Don't bother. I'm already here. I heard you got beaten up by Hua the Hearty. Looks like you're taking it out on everyone else. That's right. You're very smart. Hua sent me to get in here to kill you and get the antidote. He asked your friend here to show me the way. She's no friend of mine. She thinks she's prettier than me. There's no way we can be friends. You're absolutely right. Since you're here to kill me, why are you being so honest with me? I heard you were very beautiful. I just can't lie to a beautiful woman. How do you know I'm beautiful? Have you seen me before? That's why I'm here. I wish to see you. Fine. I'll grant you your wish. I guess I was wrong. You'll pay for that! Get out, all of you! Don't let her get away. Send the guards to catch her. - Then make her drink the poison. - Very well. Do you know why I killed him? Because I'm a man and he was just a ghost. Right. You are a real man... but that won't help you get the antidote. Really? I can destroy the box by ringing this bell. Are they all down? It's over there. - What should we do? - Leave it to me. Take a break, Mighty God. I'll take it from here. Stone Monkey, make sure that's the right box. This is the one, but it's locked. I can open it. I'm the expert here. Guess who's here? Master Mei, we've got the box. You win, I lose. That thing you're carrying must be... the world-famous Killer Meteor. Not really. Until the meteor bursts forth and you see its power... it's just a regular club with two rounded ends. And that's enough to face most of your enemies? That's right. Then when will you use your Killer Meteor? When it's time to kill. Is there anything brighter... or faster than the meteor? I don't think so. That's why no one has ever survived your Killer Meteor. So far, no. I really must see it. I don't want to kill you. But I know they won't let me go so easily. As soon as they get the antidote... She knew Hua would seek revenge... and she would die an ever more gruesome death. So she poisoned herself when she saw us with the box. I have finally returned. Master Mei. I've brought what you asked for. Leave us. I knew you would succeed. You have saved me. I owe you my life. Master. What's the meaning of this? I won't allow myself to be poisoned. But that's the antidote you wanted. It's also the poison. That cold-heated woman knew I'd try to steal it... so she put poison in it. I know her too well. She wouldn't let me off that easily. Master, the antidote... She must have hidden it elsewhere so that she could threaten me. I can save myself yet. Do you know where she hid it? Right in this box. She thought I knew nothing about this box. What's so special about that box? It looks like an ordinary box... but it's one of the seven treasures stolen from the imperial palace. It's actually the most precious of all. I've never seen this box before... but I know all its secrets. I know all about the 13 great treasures of China. This is the antidote! How come Madam Hua had the stolen treasure? Could it be... It was poison! Who is that? Surrender! You can't escape. Celestial House is on fire. Hua was rich and well-known in the martial arts world. He lived a respectable life... yet he still came to a bad end. He saved my life so I became his servant. No matter how strange he was, he will always be a hero to me. My deepest regret is... I can never repay him for saving my life. Whether he was a hero or just a decent man... it's sad to see him die this way. Excellent work, Mei. I was distracted from my investigation. By the time I got back to the house, everything was destroyed. Hua may be gone, but the evidence is still here. What evidence? This. I found it before you came back. I got that from Madam Hua. Did you forget they were husband and wife? Madam Hua got it from him. That's why he knew it so well. This box proves that he was involved. But before I could implicate him, he died of poisoning. After five years, this case is finally closed. We paid too high a price for it. It was nothing. I was just doing my job. I didn't just mean the time you spent... but also what you lost. What happened? Prepare yourself. There's something I must show you. "In Memory of Moon Breeze, My Beloved Daughter." When did it happen? A few days after you left. Where did she die'? The Rain Blossom Tavern. The Rain Blossom Tavern? Why did she go there? She was worried about you and said she wanted to help. No matter what I said, she wouldn't listen. She said she could take care of herself. It's all my fault. I spoiled her. It's all my fault. Why didn't you stop her'? But you killed the four murderers. You avenged her death. Moon Breeze, I love you. You haven't really died, for you'll always live on in my heart. Welcome. Please come in. Have a seat. Forgive me, Moon Breeze. Master Mei, have a drink. - Are they still there? - Yes. Thank you for your help. This job is not an easy one. You saved our lives. We'll do whatever you ask. It's time. I was right. You didn't die. I knew you'd be back. How did you know? Because of my friend, Magic Thief. He discovered the mechanism under the platform... and found the real treasure chest. Why didn't he take it? Why? Because they knew you would come back for it. They've waited here for you for three days. The entire cave is under our control. You're here! I've been waiting for you. Surprise! You lose again. Fortunately, I am not Madam Hua or I'd be dead. Who are you? Moon Breeze? Did you think I really died? It was a lie. Why lie to me? I wanted to know if you really loved me. - Is it that simple? - Where is your sense of humor? Then why are you here? My father told me the other six stolen treasures... might be here. You're too familiar with this place. I think you're Madam Hua. No, I am Moon Breeze, your wife. Maybe there are two of you. You saw Madam Hua die, yet I am alive. You're very smart, but you forgot one thing. What is that? There is one person who knows Madam Hua is still alive. Bring her in. It can't be. It is me. I'm still alive. You didn't think this could happen. I certainly didn't. You thought no one would ever know that you are Madam Hua. Are you surprised that she's still alive? They were supposed to have poisoned you, but you didn't die. How could this happen? You forgot about the antidote in this box. I gave it to her. You and I grew up together. I always thought of you as my sister... so I lied to Hua. I led Mei to believe that the decoy you arranged... was Madam Hua. If you're angry with me, just say so. If you want to confess everything, go ahead. Everything went according to your plan. We fooled Hua and Mei. And this is how you repay me? Didn't you always say you were the smartest? Everything went well and yet you wanted to kill me? How could you do this to me? Shut up! We grew up together. You should know me by now. You knew that I had never met Madam Hua before. That's why you had someone dress up like you. Then you poisoned her in advance... and made sure no one would be able to identify the body. Anything else? Then you had to fake your own death... or I would discover the truth after we got married. And then? I wanted to see if Hua knew the box was a fake. I didn't realize he would be too anxious to notice... and so he got himself killed. You are about to get yourself killed too. No one can decide my destiny but me. I can. You're too smart. Smart people die young. You're smart too. How come nothing happened to you? Because I am Sir Feng. Five years ago, you stole the seven treasures from the imperial palace... that were entrusted to your care. But you needed a scapegoat so you could close the case. You needed someone you could lay the blame on. That's why you chose Hua. Keep going. Your plan was to use your daughter to get to him... but it didn't work. - So you chose me. - Keep going. You used me to steal the antidote... then used the poisoned antidote to kill Hua... so you could use the treasure chest as evidence to close the case... and deflect suspicion from yourself. - Keep going! - All the pieces are in place now. The thief is the respectable Sir Feng. What else can I say? There's nothing more you can say, because you are going to die. Kill him! Let's finish this outside. You want to show me the Killer Meteor? - That's right. - Fine. After you. The Killer Meteor sure is powerful. No wonder it could defeat a martial-arts master like Sir Feng. You're still alive. To tell you the truth, it was Sir Feng and I... who broke into the imperial palace and stole the treasures. Afterward, he tried to kill me... but he underestimated my strength. He married his daughter to me to find out where I hid the treasures. I discovered their plan of the poisonous ginseng soup... and decided to play along with it. In fact, I didn't drink it at all. I was never really sick. But I saw the poison kill you. How did that happen? You did see that, but you didn't see my body putrefy. I had someone distract you and I set my house on fire... so you and Qing could testify that I had died. Once I was dead, Sir Feng and his daughter's plan would collapse. Sir Feng thought he was smart, but you're even smarter. Why tell me all this? I don't like to leave any loose ends... and all the others are already dead. Since this was your case... I felt you deserved to know the truth before you died. I'm not going to die that easy. We fought once before, so I know your kung fu. You've used up your Killer Meteor. Seems like you're out of luck. By the way, I forgot to tell you one thing. I've prepared a grave for you. You can say your last words before you die. We'll see who that grave is really for. Come with me. No matter how smart you are, you are still under my control. You forgot, there is more than one Killer Meteor! Master Mei, are you leaving again? Everyone who should have died is dead... and even some who shouldn't have. Do you want the two of us to fight to the death? I don't want to die, and I don't think you should. But there's someone who has nothing left... and really needs your help. Someone who can't forget you. Who is that? You saved her life? Everyone changed after what happened. You can tell she's no longer the Lady Phoenix. She's just a common girl, and quite an attractive one too. People will change. The meteoric light will disappear. Only love, truth and justice will last forever. And there will always be heroes... defending them till their dying day.
