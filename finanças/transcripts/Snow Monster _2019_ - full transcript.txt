Today is September 18th, 2045. It's the fifth day of the Hong Gene Research advance team's investigation. About an hour ago, we experienced a snowstorm and came to this unknown snow area. In the coming days, we will continue to explore this mysterious snow area. Xiao Qin. Say hi. Be serious. We're not here for a trip. I just wanted to make a video for my daughter. How about the data? Is it stable? It's been a while since the blizzard. Very stable. Everybody in the back sit still. There's a slope ahead. Xiao Qin, look! The geomagnetic data is climbing, and well above the normal geomagnetic field. That's interesting. Xiao Qin, what's going on? Mr Shen, Our current magnetic field is very unstable. Different loads and positive dipole are at least three levels higher. It seems that our monitoring data for this area is accurate. Shen, look at this geological waveform. Genetic variations are likely to occur in this magnetic structure. It seems that our inference is correct. Xiao Qin, pay attention to the surrounding. Safety first. Got it! Director. What's going on? Why did the heat suddenly appear? Is this a geothermal surge? Ask them to retreat! Okay! If we retreat now, our efforts would be wasted. Ask them to retreat now! Haihong, the latest order is to evacuate immediately! Repeat. Evacuate quickly! What's going on? What is that? Bro. This is the Lingtong animal head unearthed in Taixigang Village. If it's broken, you can't afford it. What're you looking at? Go beat him! Wait and see! Wait...and see! Go! Ren Yi Fei. Long time no see. Why did you close the door? Ren Yi Fei. If it wasn't Director Shen who asked me to come to you for help, I wouldn't want to see you. You left Xiao Qin alone, and stay here all day long. Who do you think you are? You are a jerk! You are a coward! Ren Yi Fei, I don't care about the past relationship between Xiao Qin and you. But I came here today to tell you Xiao Qin had an accident. Five days ago, Xiao Qin led a team to a snowy area in the Arctic. Just two days ago, We lost contact with them. Entrusted by Director Shen, I came to ask you to lead a team to bring them back. Forget it, Mr Lin. Donâ€™t talk too much with this kind of person. Ren Yi Fei. Listen to me carefully! I'll give you one last chance. I'll count to three... Loser. When do we leave? Three months ago, we analyzed it through satellite imagery, and we found a lot of geothermal heat in the Arctic snowy area. After image technical analysis, We found that the heat energy was continuous and stable. In other words, it's a whole. But it also happens near a volcano. Not only that, the geomagnetic flow is also very strong, which is very likely to affect biological genetic changes. That's what we're interested in. To find out the secrets there, Xiao Qin led a team there five days ago. But they were attacked by unknown creatures. According to the clues provided by Xiao Qin, I went back and looked up the data about it. And I discovered the area where Xiao Qin went missing. I didn't expect there is such a place. Interesting. We shouldn't be far away. You've got it wrong. Look at this place. Is this a place where a car can drive in? Old Two, you guys lead people to find the way. Okay. Hey! You can look, but don't touch anything. Fatty, give me the map. Help yourself. Tiangang. Tianqi. The ground is a circle, The rod is a needle. What are you doing? Tianfu. Tianliang. Seven stars return. It cannot be so easy. Wen Cai. See? He found it! So this should be the shen position. Wen Cai. The signal is off. Is it a line fault? Check the system to see what went wrong. Quick! Are you okay? My feet! Mr. Lin, are you okay? Are we all here? Old Five. I am here. Are you okay? What is this place? Mr. Lin, sorry about that. I sat on you. What is it? Don't make a fuss. These things are all over here. Why should you shout? This is a soldier armor of Qi Dynasty. Qi Dynasty? Qi's...Emperor. Maybe... we entered a tomb of Qi? Look, there's a hole in the head. Also here. Also here. These people pierced holes in their heads? Also here. Also here. Over there, too. This is a geological layer only found in the Cretaceous period. The Cretaceous? Is it the time when there were dinosaurs? The stone is actually hot! Don't touch it! The first element of adventure. Don't touch or take the remnants. Don't you know? What the hell! Idiot! Fatty, what did you say? What are you doing? Bro. Wen Cai. There's a high concentration of phosphorus. Never ignite. This is not a battlefield. If you want to get out alive, You have to listen to me. You guys listen clearly. Did you hear what my brother said? Ren Yi Fei Why is it so cold here? I feel like we're being screwed by you. Are you sure we can reach the snowy area from here? Aren't you the king of adventure? My family only bore one son for each of nine consecutive generations. You have to protect me. My mother is expecting me to have a son. Ren Yi Fei. It's just a dead crow. What's strange about it? Cut the crap. This is not a crow. This kind of birds became extinct thousands of years ago. Don't you find it strange? The environment here is not suitable for animals. How did they survive? Interesting. The unique wet flow value in the cave will calcify this bones. But... It doesn't seem to have been dead for long. It's biologically possible. Because of the wet climate of the cave... We can't go any further. Keep moving. Are you not going to save Xiao Qin? Weren't you great just now? Why look like a coward now? Baldie, he looks like you when you were young, right? Baldie? Why did he disappear suddenly? Baldie, please reply. It's useless. There's too much geomagnetic interference here. Bro, come with me. Who's there? Baldie ,what are you doing? Don't pretend to be a ghost. Holy crap! Those bodies all had holes in the back of their heads. Can it be... Watch out! All over there! Fire! Hei Zi, come back! Look around. Stay in formation. One o'clock. Spread out. Shield yourselves! They are getting more and more. Fall back! Cover! Pay attention to the left. Cover yourselves. They are everywhere. Fall back quickly! Save the fire! There are too many. Get out of here! You Cai, move! Sound. They rely on sound to find their target. You Cai was hung up! Be quiet! Handsome, get up and make money! Handsome, get up and make money! Get up. The alarm clock! Run! Quick! Quick! Quick! Light! That's the exit! Run over there! Are you okay? I'm fine. Get up. What is this place? Be careful. Found it! I finally found it! Can the source of energy here form high pressure and excite the upper atmosphere molecules, like the North and South Poles, to form the aurora? No. This is not an aurora. Quantum fluctuations are random. According to the intensity of time dependence of the transverse field, a quantum fragmentation between states is formed. Visually it's like an object coming to me. This is exactly what I proposed as the space rainbow layer hypothesis. I didn't expect it actually exists. Who wants to go to heaven if purgatory looks like this? Do you have news from Xiao Qin? They put on surveillance clothes before they set off If they're lucky... Ren Yi Fei, please reply. Copy that. Your current position is where Xiao Qin lost her signal. I leave all that to you. Please. Rest assured, director. I will certainly bring her back. Let's go. What is this? Wen Cai, what is this? This is a megafauna fossil. It seems the geomagnetism of this place does affect the size of creatures. If we continue going on, I'm afraid... I got something! It's our car. They probably got into an accident here. Xiao Qin. Xiao Qin may still be alive. Alert. Coming. Ten o'clock direction. Fire. Glasses, get back. Danger! Glasses, quick! Quick! Glasses, quick! Glasses hold on! Boss. Glasses! Move to a higher place. Let's go! Yes. It's below. Keep moving up! Yi Fei. Finally found it! It really exists. It's the snow monster. Be careful not to disturb it. Fire! Rocket gun. Go! Avalanche. Quick! Get back! Go! Run! Quick! Go! Help! Quick! Go! Elder, all is ready. Yi Fei, I don't want to die. Yi Fei. Don't move. Elder. Elder. Don't come near! Elder, be careful! Let go! Let go! Kaya. Kaya. Kid. You're dead! Do you want to die? So handsome! What is she talking about? I don't know. Maybe something like she'll peel your skin off. Stop it. It's all right. Xiao Qin. Stop it. Xiao Qin, I finally found you! Are you okay? Xiao Qin. You woke up. Where are we? This is the primitive tribe of the snowy area. You are poisoned with cold. You are weak now. You've been buried in snow for too long. They were trying to cure you by bloodletting. But you put a knife to the elder's neck once you woke up. Xiao Qin, you guys... Just like you, I was already here when I woke up. Tun Zi and Xiao Wang were badly hurt, but Xiao Zhuang... Are Professor Lin and other people okay? They found their footprints and people have been sent for them. Glasses, Old Six, Baldie, Sorry, dudes. Rest in peace. Boss, we're back. Did you find them? No. Have a rest. Okay. Everybody stay on alert. How's that? Several protective bags are missing, other things are intact. Alert. Did you see that? It appears again. Mr. Tyson, Your brothers will not die in vain. You think I risked my life, taking you to this fucking place, just to save that little girl? I've studied genetics for most of my life, I've been waiting for this day. Let me tell you. I'm actually employed by the Middle East Shark Group. You can call me Henry. I'm not Chinese. I can give you as much commission as you want as long as you help me catch them. I can keep you from suffering. Are you crazy? That's a huge monster! If you can pull out one of its hairs, we'll all respect you. I can help you. Yi Fei, do you know? I work day and night only hoping to find this place. After I get out of here, I'm going to tell everybody that there is such a beautiful place in this world. There are so many unknowns waiting for us to find out. Xiao Qin. Did you know that the Indians all disappeared after Columbus discovered the New Continent? If the people out there know about this place, we both know the consequences. I'm just fulfilling my dream. I'm a scientist. I am the one who can change the destiny of mankind. What do you want to change? Haven't we destroyed enough? I was on my way to the bathroom and passed by here. Did you make her angry again? Ren Yifei. You know what? Only Xiao Qin can tolerate your bad temper. Can't you change yourself? Get out! What did you say? I said get out! Alright. Ren Yifei. What did you say before? You said, we, the expedition trio were going to find the new Atlantis and we would be a legend in the adventure world. Look at you. What have you done to achieve that goal? What have you done! You're a coward! Ren Yifei. Do you know? How much effort has Xiao Qin made in order to realize your bullshit dream! But look at you. You always go away as you wish. Men should keep their words. Loser. These are two different matters. You're right. You have your goals. I have my own belief. Belief? Are you qualified to say the word "faith"? Knock it off! It seems that the snow monster is nearby. Mr. Henry, this mission has been approved by General Gonge. The coordinates have been sent. They are deciphering the location of the entrance. Good. Proceed. Mr. Henry, A member of ours is still lost. Mr. Tyson, I hope you can remember one thing clearly. I didn't pay you to waste my time here. It's not a big deal to lose some people if you want to achieve great accomplishments. Haven they given up on landing on the moon just because some astronauts died? I do love money. But I won't trade my man's life for it. Believe it or not, I'll kill you now. Alright. I feel so sorry for your brother's death. But you have to remember. To achieve great accomplishments, you have to pay the price. More gains, more risks. Now you have two choices. First, kill me. But if you choose this one, you and your men will get nothing. Second, finish the job well and get more money than you need and do whatever you want. You'll be able to get what others can't. Think about it. How can you make his death worthwhile ? She is the mother of Kaya, the leader of the tribe, and also the supreme woman. She can communicate with the snow monster. This tribe considers the snow monster as the sacred animal. They meet with the snow monster on the third day of the twelfth lunar month every year. Interesting. Xiao Qin. You and Kaya are pretty close, huh? I need your help. Forget about it. She is the daughter of the leader and also the strongest fighter here. If you want to marry her, you have to defeat her. If you fail, one of your fingers will be cut off. Oh my god, that's so creepy. Look at Haba over there. He is one of the admirers of Kaya. Kaya, invite the guests up here. Wait for me. Welcome my guests from afar. Welcome. They are the guests from afar. Uncle Lin. Fire. Why? Why did you do that? Why? Xiao Qin. I'm really happy that you're lucky enough to survive a great calamity. But you let me down. You are as cowardly as your father. That snow monster's body contains mysterious genes. I'm here today to bring it back. Take me to where it is. Take me to where it is. Elder. Take her down. Go. Don't move. Xiao Qin. Let me take you to witness the moment of victory. Uncle Lin. take me with you and let her go. Henry. Keep an eye on them. Others follow me. Ren Yifei. It seems that I'll have to die here with you this time. Hurry up! Old five, give me a cigarette. Thanks. Boss. Something's wrong. Where is Old Two? I don't know. Sharks! There are so many sharks! Run! Spread out quickly! Everybody stand on the rock! Retreat. Give me the gun. Take them down. Get down. Uncle Lin. Uncle Lin. How dare you fool me? Use your heart-to-heart communication with the snow monster and hand it over to me. I'll count to three. One. Uncle Lin. Two. Three. Spread out. Go. They're here. Tyson. General Gongga's reinforcements have arrived. They finally found the entrance here. Surrounded by dispersed. Turn on the magnetic sound waves. Uncle Lin. Stop! Now! Xiao Qin, I watched you grow up from little. Uncle Lin. Do you know how many years I have waited for this moment? Stop? I can't be a loser all my life like your father. Now I ask you one last time. Join or die? Answer my question! Join or die? Xiao Qin! Hold tight! Hold on tight! Ren Yifei. My dick is breaking apart. Old Four. Help me. The snow monster can barely stand. Don't move. Old Four, take care of him. Why are you helping them? Xiao Qin. Kaya. My Kaya. We look forward to seeing you again. Bon voyage. We look forward to seeing you again. Take care. Bon voyage. Take care. We look forward to seeing you again. Bon voyage. We look forward to seeing you again. Bon voyage. We look forward to seeing you again. Xiao Qin is back. Xiao Qin. Xiao Qin. Great! I am back. Sir. Look.
