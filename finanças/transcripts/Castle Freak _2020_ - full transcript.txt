The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the path of righteousness. And though I walk through the valley of the shadows of death... ...I will fear no evil. Where are you? Please help me save this lost soul. Tell me what to do. You filthy, filthy pig! You filthy... ...beast! Your fate is in God's hands now. May he forgive me. Thanks. Am I interrupting something? Hey, Becks. Where you been? - We were just talking. - Yeah? Why don't you talk to someone else? Whatever you say, Becks. Bye, Shelly. Damn, I love it when you're jealous. - Mm. - It gets me so hard. Yeah? Is that why you're always talking to other girls behind my back? 'Cause you got problems keeping it up? Whatever works, right? The universe is not what it appears to be. You think our world is the only one that exists. There are others. Hi. Good to see you. Parallel universes, if you will. Each with their own versions of this world and ourselves. Right, so you're trying to tell me there's another me in another universe, sitting on my ass with you guys, drinking my Crown Royal? Come on. It's not as absurd as you may think. It all comes down to particle arrangements. It's not just philosophy. It's science. Yeah, well, tell me this, then, Professor. If there are so many other universes out there, how come we ain't never heard of them? 'Cause these universes are frustratingly inaccessible. For now, at least. I'll bet the government is hiding them from us. Or enslaving those other worlds. - Man, we're enslaved here. - Preach, brother. Professor, what the hell do you know about other universes? This guy's never even left Massachusetts. An open mind has no limits. Alright, see, but th I can relate to. I mean, I always have an open mind. And I rarely have limits. - Here you go, baby. - Thank you. Hey, Professor, you ever heard of the lizard people? Lizard people? What the fuck are you talking about, Chuck? He's talking about a race of aliens. Cold-blooded, humanoid reptilians that live among us. That have the power to shape-shift into human form. Lizard people, man. This is what they're teaching you at that fancy university? This is no joke, John. These lizard people, they look just like us. And they become politicians and movie stars - to push their lizard agenda. - Goddamn. I guess the government really is fucking us six ways from Sunday. That's why I'm always on alert. When the shit goes down, and the government tries to take what's mine, I'm gonna be ready for it. Yeah, you and me both, brother. You guys are so fucking weird. Thank you. That's the smartest thing I heard all night. Come on. You want to get out of here? - Yes. Let's go. - Mm. - Ooh. - Give me some of this. There you go. - Alright, okay. - Mnh-mnh. Let's... Let's go. Come on. What are you doing? Hey. Hey, get the fuck off my car, man! Get in the car. What's wrong with you? Jesus, I'm fine. Here. Want a cigarette? Here. - You good? - Yeah, I'm fine. Do you want me to drive? I got it. It's fine. - You sure? - Yes. What are you fucking asking me for? It's fine. Jesus. - I can't see! - Becca?! - I can't see! - Becca! - I can't see! - Fuck. - Are you okay? - Um... Oh, God. Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, how long till we get there, man? Just a few more miles, sir. This your first time here in Albania? What do you think? You nervous? Yeah. A little bit. Well, don't be, alright? I know it's all pretty weird, but we got this, okay? Mm. Oh. What's that smell? You smell that? What's it like? It must be old. Yeah, it's really old. It's... I don't know... Not without its charms, I guess. You got to be kidding me. What? It's that bad, huh? Bec, I've never seen anything like this. I knew it. Finally you have arrived. Welcome to Whateley Castle. Did he just say "castle"? Looks like our luck is changing. This way, please. It is an honor to meet you, Ms. Whateley. I hope your journey wasn't painful. - Reilly. - I'm sorry? My last name is Reilly. Rebecca Reilly. Not Whateley. Oh, I apologize. And the gentleman is? The name's John. I'm the boyfriend. - This place is tight. - Yeah. Whateley Castle has stood for hundreds of years. Its history precedes even the town's. I don't understand. This was my mother's house? Yes. Lavinia Whateley became the owner of Whateley Castle after her father passed away. - That's this guy? - Yes. That is the late Mr. Whateley. What did he die of? I believe it was a... heart matter. Oh. John, can you describe it to me? It's big, Becks. It's really big. That's right. I just don't get it. Becca thought that her mom gave her up for adoption 'cause she was poor. You must understand... Ms. Whateley was not a well woman. She was a recluse. No one in the village had seen her for many years. She chose to be apart from everyone. But I'm sure she thought you would have a better life in America. Anyway, our castle is yours to do with as you wish. Yeah, we're selling it. Hmm? - Right, hon? - Do you hear that? Hear what? I understand. The idea of living here could feel strange initially. But I am sure, with time, you will appreciate it. Hey, take a walk with me, alright? Let's go. Becks, I'll be right back, okay? Alright. I can have the castle on the market tomorrow at least, but maybe it will take some time to get the right offer. Yeah, but don't hold out for a high bid or anything. You know? The sooner we get rid of this place, the better. Of course. By the way, if you need some assistance with the furniture, I can get some locals to come and help. No, it's cool. We've got friends coming from the States in a few days. Together, we'll be able to take care of it. Oh, I see. Hold on. Just out of curiosity, do you know how the old woman died exactly? Yes, I do. It was a suicide. No, I know. I mean how. I believe it was self-flagellation. What's that? It's like, uh... Take this, please. What... That's pretty fucked up, man. As I said to you, Ms. Whateley was a very sick woman. Religious fanatic, you know. She believed in many strange things. Do you think that's gonna put off buyers or no? Ah, no, no, no, no, no. I don't think so. You know, those who are in the market for purchasing old castles usually have, um... how to say... eccentric tastes. Alright. Good man. You take Castle Grayskull off our hands, you get a healthy commission. But, um, don't tell Becca what you told me, alright? 'Cause she's been through a lot. It's all weird enough. She doesn't... She doesn't need any more trauma. - I understand very well. - Yeah. This is my private number. If you need anything, I mean, anything... at your disposal. Thank you, Marku. Okay. That Marku guy sure was a character. God, I guess these folks are pretty stuck in the past, huh? I was thinking he could help me find out more about my mother. He seemed to know a lot about her. I don't know, Becks. You really want to go there with him? I've got a feeling there's some skeletons in the Whateley family closet you're better off not letting out. Come on. The guys will be here in a few days. We'll focus on selling this place and everything in it. Are you sure it's a good idea that they come? Why not? They're our friends. Are they? I thought they were just people that we partied with. Look, they're doing us a favor coming all the way over here. I can't unload all this stuff by myself. Come on. Won't you feel better with a whole bunch of people around you you know? A bunch of people. I can't go back to that life, John. It nearly killed me. - It nearly killed both of us. - Hey, I know that, okay? And the crew knows that, too. Larry, I talked to him. He said the guys would be on their best behavior, alright? No booze, no drugs. Them's the castle rules. - Don't. - Why not? - I'm not in the mood. - Oh, come on. You're never in the mood anymore. Man, I wish you could forgive me. Yog-Sothoth! Yog-Sothoth! I'll find your daughter. John? John? John?! - John. - Hey. Becks, I'm in here. - Hey. - Hi. Sorry. I didn't know you were up. - I would have helped you. - I'm okay. - Mwah. - Is there coffee? - Yes, there is. - Yes. Take a seat right there. Yes. Oh. A cup of coffee for my gorgeous girl. - Mm. - Mwah. - Thank you. - How'd you sleep? Mm. Terrible. I had the most awful nightmare. Yeah, that'll happen when you're sleeping in a new place. - Especially one like this. - I saw someone being whipped. - It was weird. - Whipped, huh? - Yeah. - Kinky. I wish. It was awful. It felt so real. You'll feel better once Larry and the guys get here. The more people in this place, the less scary it'll feel. I hope so. Bacon. Mmm. What the hell? The mirrors are all broken. - Steps right there. - Mm. Oh, my God. What is it? Oh, this room is incredible. Here, take the railing right here. There you go. Jesus. I wish you could see this. Really? Me too. So funny. Sorry. It's weird. It's like a church almost. I don't know. There's stone everywhere. There's animal skin on the floor. Watch your step. Watch your step. There you go. Oh. What? What is it? - What is it? - Nothing. Nothing. What do you mean, "nothing"? Looks like this is some kind of altar room. Is this is where your mom came to pray? Why would she pray down here? I don't know. Maybe she wanted privacy. From who? John, can we go now? What's going on? Answer me. Nothing, nothing, nothing. Just more weirdness. Okay, well, I don't like it in here. Can we please go? Yeah. Yeah, don't get upset. It's just a bunch of old religious crap. Oh, I think this was your mother's bedroom. Here, come sit. No sheets. Oh, fucking flies! Jesus. Oh, there's some old dresses in here. - Can I have one? - Yeah. God, it stinks in there. We ought to wash some of this stuff if you want any of it. Personally I think we should sell it all to a thrift shop. Oh, Mother. Who were you? Hello? Hello, Ms. Whateley. Hi. Oh, Reilly. But that's okay. The Reillys weren't much of a family to me either. I wanted to see how are you doing. If there is anything I can do for you... Actually I'm glad that you stopped by. There's something I wanted to ask you. Let's go for a walk. Yes. Please. Do you know anything about my father? In my adoption file, it just says "unknown." I'm afraid not. I can make inquiries in town if you'd like. If it's not too much trouble. Oh, no trouble at all. If there is anything else you need help with... Hmm? Maybe I can assist in getting some of your mother's items appraised. No, John definitely has that covered on his own. But, you know, I'll let him know that you offered your help. Wait. I'll help you. Thank you. And... ...are you sure you want to sell the castle? I know you find it overwhelming on arrival, but maybe something's changing in you. I guess I'm just not much of a castle girl. I hope you understand. I only ask about your feelings because, well, I grew up here and I cannot imagine living anyplace else. We may seem old-fashioned. But life here can really be surprising in ways you cannot imagine. You know, I'll keep it in mind. Really, thank you for everything. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Yeah. Mm... Sounds like a view. Oh! Whoa, whoa. Becca. Hey, wake up. Hey, you're having a nightmare. Becca. Becca. - Whoa, whoa. Wake up. - There's someone in here with... There's someone in here! There's someone in here with us! I'm telling you, there was somebody in the room with us. I could feel them. Becca, there's nobody else here. These are just bad dreams. It's normal, considering everything you've been through. Maybe. What color is my mother's robe? In my dream, it was red. Babe, it's blue. Alright? The robe's blue. It feels red to me. Hey. Listen, when we sell this place, we are gonna have money to do whatever we want. I mean, think about that. Think about our future together, okay? I love you, Rebecca. I love you more than anything in the world. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's not. It's fine. You didn't mean it. Bec? Mm. - Becca, where are you? - In here. What are you doing? You're gonna hurt yourself. Relax. You know, I've got this. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I can't rely on you to take care of me forever. I've got to learn to do some stuff myself. - Alright. If you say so. - Yeah, I say so. - It smells good. - Thanks. Mm. And you know what? You should get started on selling everything here. The sooner we get rid of everything, the sooner we can get out of here and get on with our lives. Yeah? - That sounds like a plan. - Okay, good. - Mm. - Mm! Shit. "Casa Giorgio Orsino. 1926." Goddamn, that's old. John? John? Hello? Hello? God! Becca, what's going on? Hey, what happened? - What'd you do? - Somebody was there! I swear, there was somebody. Get up. Get up, get up, get up. Come on. Let me see this. Let me see. Move your hand, move your hand. Fuck. Come on. God, this could have been bad. - Hey! - Shit. You're lucky this thing didn't land on your head. There's someone here. I heard him in the walls. It was probably a squirrel. It was not a squirrel! This thing was big. Okay, then it was a big squirrel. It was a big Albanian squirrel. It was a person. Becca, man, there's nobody else here! You got to get a grip. Maybe we should leave. Baby, we're not leaving. What are you talking about? We can't leave now. We've got everything to do. We got to get everything appraised. We got to go through it all. I mean, what? - Marku can help us. - No, Marku's a weirdo. I barely trust him to sell this place. - Alright, well, we need help. - No, we don't need help. Man. I can take care of this. The guys are coming anytime. You really want them showing up to an empty castle? Okay. Look, I know it's a creepy place, but it's also a very big place filled with a lot of really valuable stuff. I mean, this is our chance to finally get ahead, and we're not gonna get that chance again. And you know that, right? Yeah. I'll take a look around. I'll see if I find anything. Does that make you feel better? Hello? - Hi. Marku? - This is Marku. Yeah, it's John from up at the castle. Remember? I remember. Listen, so, you know how you said you could help us out? Hello? I'm just not feeling so good. I'm kind of in need of some, uh... ...pharmaceuticals... if you know what I mean. I will send someone straightaway. Alright, thanks. I'm gonna get some more boxes from downstairs. I'll be right back, okay? Don't be gone too long, okay? Honey, I searched the whole castle, alright? - There's nothing here. - Really? You searched every single room in 20 minutes? Baby, I searched a lot of it, alright? Hey, come on. I'll be right back, okay? Are you Marku's friend? I'm Doctor. I bring the pharmaceuticals. Okay. Cool. - Yeah, follow me. - Okay. So, what do you want? Huh? Do you want coke, speed, Ecstasy, Molly? - I got it all, bro. - No, no, none of that shit, man. Just give me some downers, alright? You got downers? So, you are rich American. Living in castle. I like rich Americans. They really know how to party, yeah? I don't know. I guess, man. I'm just trying to take the edge off. The edge. The edge! I like the edge. Fucking tear that shit out, bro. Yeah, okay. There you go. Good doing business with you. I got some H. We live on edge. I could get us girls, boys, whatever you want. No, man, alright? I'm good. Alright? I'm good. - Let me show you the way out. - Ah, yeah. I shoot up here. Alright, what?! I shoot up. Heroin. Here! I can't do it at home. I'm living with my mother. But, here, in the big fucking castle, I can. - Yeah? I can. - No. - Actually no. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright, you got it. Mi casa es su casa, alright? Awesome, bro. The Doctor will hook you up anytime. - Thanks, bud. - Yeah. Do me a favor. Be quiet on your way out, okay? - Okay. Quiet. - Quiet. I'm quiet here. Hey, hon. Your man's back. Oh, what you got there? I found it in my mother's closet. - Can you describe it to me? - Yeah. Yeah, of course. Here. I'll take that. Oh, it's in another language. Hey. You are here for party? Go ahead. The Doctor shares. No, I already blast off. No. These pictures are pretty freaky. Mm. Well, there's some pretty far-out stuff in here. It looks really, really old. It's probably valuable. Maybe we can have Marku look at it. He said he'd help us get some stuff appraised. We do not need Marku. We have The Professor. Thank you. So, where the hell is this place again? Up there. - Hey, hey, hey. - Hey, hey! Alright, come here. - Welcome. How you doing? - How you living, baby? - Come on. - What's up, man? - How you doing? - Hey. - Welcome. You too. - Good to see you. - You too. Get up there. - Hey, John. My dear. Mwah. How you doing? - I'm alright. - Alright, good. - Good to see you. - You too. Hey. Reading already? What is this? Albania. Alright, study it up, study it up. Hey, boys! - Party! - Welcome, welcome. - Alright? - Not bad. Dude. Man, you stepped up. Hey, hey, out of the way, out of the way. Alright, so, this is the great hall, you guys. Look. Look how big this room is. Now, there's more to show you, alright? So, there's a bear rug. There's a fucking bear rug. Look at this. - Come here. - Whoa, whoa. - Now, look. - This place is swank. You can say that again. Chuck. - Yo. - Not bad, right? Who's the creepy dude? That's Rebecca's grandfather, man. He was, like, lord of the manor. - Lord of the weirdos. - Yes, that, too. Does this mean you're now the lord of the manor? John? Hey, Becks. How's it going? It's going good, Chuck. It's nice to see you, Rebecca. Yeah, nice castle you got here. Thanks. Hey, Rebecca. Um... Wow, you look really cool. I love those sunglasses. Thanks, Shelly. I didn't realize you would be coming. Yeah, well, you know, with these guys being so busy and all, I thought you could use some girl time. How nice. Hey, Professor, there's something I want to show you. Come here. All this stuff is so fucking creepy. I'm gonna go freshen up. - The Necro-what? - The Necronomicon. A grimoire book of spells. You mean like witchcraft? I believe it dates back to the Middle Ages. This is clearly the Latin edition. Can you read Latin? Of course. How do you know about this book? There have been rumors that the Miskatonic University housed a copy of the Necronomicon. But it was stolen. I believe in the 1920s. Maybe that's the copy we have here. In Albania? The followers of the Necronomicon span the four corners of the globe. This isn't Manson out in Death Valley with a handful of followers. This is a worldwide cult that follow the ways of this book. Hey, so, the million-dollar question is, how much is it worth? Worth? It's priceless. Looking good, bitch. Looking real good. Oh. Oh, John, John, John. A fucking castle. Here's to us, John. Oh, beast. Where are you hiding? Hold on. Aah! Oh, no! Fascinating. What is it? This passage details a race of ancient deities known as the Great Old Ones. They were monstrous creatures who once ruled over the earth. They were imprisoned in another dimension. Look, this is Yog-Sothoth. He's the key to everything. Okay, you're geeking out, Professor. If the pursuit of knowledge is geeking out, then, yes, John, I am geeking out. Guys, this doesn't make sense. I thought my mother was a Christian. Maybe this wasn't your mother's. Look at this magnificent beast. - I believe his name is Cthulhu. - Don't get too attached to the weird monster book, Professor. We're selling it. You can't sell this. It's a major discovery. John, maybe we shouldn't sell it. It's family history. Yeah, some family. - John? - You know, fine. We won't sell the creepy goddamn book if it means so much to you. Thanks for your help, Professor. Hey. Hey, asshole. Okay. I deserve that. Sorry I snapped. I think this place might be getting to me, too. Are we still friends? Yeah, we're still friends. Come here. Sorry to interrupt. - Rebecca. - Yeah? You said you found the book in your mother's room? Yeah, it was in her closet. Can you show me the exact spot? Yeah. We're headed into town to see about selling some stuff, so... - Alright. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm good. - Alright. Okay. I'll see you later. Alright. So, it was in the cabinet on the top shelf. Professor?! - Rebecca. - What?! You're having a vision. It's okay, it's okay. He abused my mother. Who are you talking about? Let's try here. Hey. I'm from the castle up there on the hill, mountain. We're looking at selling some stuff. I was wondering if you might want to come by and take a look? I'm not interested. What do you mean, you're not interested? Why? That castle's filled with priceless antiques. That castle is filled... with evil. What are you talking about? When Lavinia Whateley died... ...I thought it was over. No longer would our town be cursed by their ungodly bloodline. But it didn't end. When they found Ms. Whateley, her body had been smashed to a bloody pulp. Our cattle, they have been eaten alive. Evil still resides in that castle. And now that the demon spawn has returned to her birthright, - all hope is lost. - Hey, watch your mouth. That's my girlfriend you're talking about. Then you, sir, are in bed with a beast. Oh. Okay. Well... I think that I will be taking my business elsewhere. Thank you for your time. Listen to me. You best heed my warning. Get out of that castle. You may think you have control over your world, but you couldn't be more wrong. There are dark forces... beyond what you... Get out of here, you rotten bastards! Jesus Christ, John. Let's get the fuck out of here. Good idea. - Fools! - What is going on? Jesus. You must listen to me! - Hey. - John. - Yes? Fucking... - Come on. Really? Wow. You sure? Okay, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks a lot. What's wrong? That was the estate manager. Not only is the castle not on the market... ...but the guy we've been dealing with there doesn't even work there. He had no idea who I was talking about. I mean, what's really going on? Stop. Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no! No, no, no, no. No. Listen to me. We can work together. No, no! No, no, no! Do not let this be a repeat of New Year's Eve. - Oh. - I'm serious, okay? Promise. "No New Year's Eve, Shelly." Can we get this started, please? As long as we're all in agreeance. - What are you guys doing? - Ohh! I can't believe you fuckers brought coke, man. You're lucky you're not in jail, man. Relax. Smuggling coke is easy. Chuck snuck it up his ass. Do what you've got to do. Yeah, man. Oh, if Rebecca finds out you have it, she's gonna flip. Dude. She's blind. Larry, shut the fuck up, man. She can, like... She can sense things. Relax, man. Here. - No. - Suit yourself. You need some coke. Yeah, I do. That's my girl. According to this passage, there's a prophecy that the Old Ones will return to this world and cast it into eternal darkness. Each of these deities has its own cult that follows and worships them. These people actually want the Old Ones to return. You can see whatever you want. - You good? - In my vision, my grandfather ripped a crucifix from my mother's neck. Maybe he belonged to one of these cults. That would explain the Necronomicon being here. Listen to this. "Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the past, present..." Alright, that's enough. I mean, this is just getting nuts. This whole town is insane. Now you guys are, too? Old Ones? I'm sorry. Old Ones? It's the biggest bunch of shit I ever heard in all my life. John, are you okay? No, I'm not okay, Becks. I'm... I'm tired, man. I'm tired of all this shit. You're tired? Really, John? How do you think I feel? I'm blind, John. I'm fucking blind. What do you want me to do about it? Actually, what do you want me to do? I've been right here for you. Haven't I? Have you been? Really? There's someone living in the walls of this castle, and you won't even believe me. The Professor does, so why won't you? Because The Professor's a lunatic and I'm not. - No offense, Professor. - Duly noted. I'm sorry. What the hell did she just say? That there's someone in the fucking walls? There is nobody in the goddamn walls, okay?! This is just hysteria. The whole damn town has it. It's not hysteria, John. It's real. You know, my whole life has been a big goddamn mystery. There's someone here living in this castle, and if you don't want to help me find out who it is, then you can get the fuck out of my way. Come on, Professor. Becca, hey. Don't. Don't! I'm sorry, Becca. Hey. G... Hey. Hey. Come here. Come on. It's alright. Let her go. You guys obviously need some space. And you, God, you need to unwind, Lord John. It's tough business running a castle. Let your lady attend to you. Come on. Come on. Thataboy. Okay, it was here along this wall. That's where I heard it. It's hollow. Yeah, that's what I thought. Can you hand me my mom's robe? The red one? Yep. The red one. I knew it. There's a secret passage. No way. Are you going in it? Professor? Professor, don't go far. I'll be right there, okay? 1929. Fuck that. What a year. No, that's my boy. Mm. Mm. You're not quitting on me. Come on, come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, wake up, wake up. - Okay? - No, man. Oh, no, I got to get this. Hey, toss that over here. Have one. You're not quitting man. Where's my boy? Open the fuck up. Yeah, there we go. Yeah, you ready? Yeah, yeah. There's my fuckin' man. You're my fuckin' man. You're my fuckin' man. You're my... Yeah. There we go. That's my guy. Oh! Fucking wasting it, man. You alright? Mm. To you. Thank you. That's what I like to see. There's a woman who knows how to have fun. Hey. Why don't you... ...give me a tour of the castle? Yeah? The whole big, giant castle. What do you say? - Yeah. - Yes. Yeah. Why not? Come on. John always gets laid. What's he got that we don't? A castle. Right. Is that the sound you heard? Yeah. Oh. Oh, John. Oh, take your shirt off. You do it. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, John. Oh, fuck. Uh. Oh, fuck. You may proceed, Lord John. And what do we have here? It must have been Becca's mom's. I guess freak runs in the family. God. - Oh. - Get up there. Oh, John. What are you doing? God. I'm yours, baby. Do it. I dare you. John, you're perfect. Yeah, fuck that. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, John. Ah! Shit, Shelly. What are you doing? Don't stop now. Come on. Come on. Oh. Oh, fuck. Come on. Don't stop. Oh, baby. Yeah. I wish you could see this. John said the same thing. Help! Somebody, man, help! Please! Help! Hey, somebody, man, help! Come on! Is it... Yo. Hey. Who's that? Holy fucking... What is it? Fucking covered in blood. Where's Shelly, man? She ain't here, man. Get me the fuck out of these things! Hey, hey. Fuck. What? What? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, man. What the fuck? Alright, whoever did this, they are gonna fucking pay. Come on, let's go. Oh, fuck. Whatever's hiding in the walls, I think it lives here. I know. I can feel it. Whatever it is, it hasn't been gone long either. Candles are still lit. Shit, there's a book. What's it say? "Father committed the basis of sin." He has allowed the monster to use him as a vessel, to impregnate me with its evil seed in hopes of opening the gate so that the Old Ones may return. One daughter bears the mark of the monster. The other, it's too early to tell. The twins must be separated... "...until Father returns." This prick's got to be here somewhere. Come on. Help! Somebody help me! It's that way. Come on. What are you doing down here? Help me. Marku, what the fuck happened, man? Tell me! It was her. Foul beast. Vile demon. What are you talking about, man? I am talking about the abomination that lives in the castle. The freak! We have to stop her. Her appetites cannot be contained. She is insatiable. Please, please! Get me out of here before she comes back. Get him out of that thing. Yeah? Who the fuck are you, Marku? Why should I believe a goddamn word you have to say? Because I know this castle inside and out. I can help you get out of here, but we have to act fast. No, no, no, no, no, I'm not going anywhere, alright? You understand that? And you know why? 'Cause this is my castle. And I will be damned if some inbred freak bitch is gonna run me out. Damn right. We're here with you, bro. Follow me, boys. Do you know what this means? My grandfather raped my mother, then told her it wasn't him, that he was possessed by some monster so he could get away with it. He brainwashed her into believing in these Old Ones. She must have thought that she was evil because she was born deformed, and she sent me away to protect me. I don't know about all that. Why not? I think we should get out of here... before whatever lives here returns. Oh, I totally just popped a boner. Same here, bro. I'm rock hard. Okay, we should split up now, huh? That way we can cover more ground. That's a good idea. Alright. Chuck and Larry, you guys take upstairs. Marku and I, we handle things down here. Let's hurry the fuck up before this thing finds Rebecca, alright? We've been preparing our whole lives for this shit, bro. The bitch will be neutralized and destroyed. Fucking A. Let's go! Ah! Ah! Hey! Hey! - What was that? - I'm gonna go check it out. No, no, no, Professor. Professor! I know who you are. You're my sister. Rebecca. You're my sister. Rebecca. Rebecca. Don't. Don't. No! Wait, wait, wait. Come back. Come back, please. What the fuck was that? I don't know, but we're gonna find out. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. What, man? Let's just think about this for a sec, man. Think about what? You pussying out? No, man. I just think we need to take a sec and think about a strategy. A strategy? The best strategy is the element of surprise. Now, I say we go in there and we fuck our shit up before that bitch knows what hit her. Yeah? Sounds like a pretty good plan. Right? Alright? So on the count of three. Hmm? One, two... Three. Did you hear that? Come on! Don't be afraid. My friends, they call me The Professor. My God, you glorious specimen. The book, that's how I know of your kind. But it's not enough. I want to see the gate. I want to see Yog-Sothoth. He is the key to life and death. And so are you. Show me everything. Aaaah! I can see. I can see everything. No. No. No. No. No! Oh, no, no, no, no. No! Yog-Sothoth. Yog-Sothoth. Why don't you come on out? I got something for you. Marku, where the hell'd this chick come from anyway? She's the daughter of Yog-Sothoth. No one can stop Yog-Sothoth. Certainly not you. Marku, are you fucking crazy? I'm chosen. Yog-Sothoth spoke to me. He summoned me here to save a child and reunite the sisters so he may return. I find your daughter. No. No. She will be soon here to be reunited with her sister. There are many more like me. Disciples of Yog-Sothoth are all waiting for this moment, the return of the great Old One. I'll kill you, you crazy fucking asshole. No, you won't. And neither will your friends, who are most certainly dead by now. Once the great Old One's offsprings are united, the gate shall open once more. This time, forever. Yog-Sothoth knows the key. Yog-Sothoth is the key. Yog-Sothoth is past, present, future. All are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through, and where they shall... Hey, freak! Ah! Oh, this is my castle now, huh? You hear me?! Mine! All mine! Now, you fucking freak. This is for Shelly. And pissing me off. John? John! Stop it! - Stay out of this! - Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her! Please stop! Stop! Stop it! Stop it! - Let go! - Stop! She's my sister! She's my sister. Yeah, you're just like her, huh? You're a freak! Stop! You and your whole family! Please. Please. Please. - Stop! - Stand up! John. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. The prophecy has been fulfilled. The daughters of Yog-Sothoth have been reunited. The two make one. It's time for the old great ones to return! Don't fight it, Rebecca. We have been chosen by the Old Ones. Everything that happened happened by their design. Embrace your sister, Rebecca. Embrace your father. Embrace your family. Aah! Aah! Enter. Just a moment. Mr. Armitage, how can I help you? West.
