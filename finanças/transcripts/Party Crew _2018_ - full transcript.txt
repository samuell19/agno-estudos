Since the dawn of time, people searched for immortality. Some looked for the Holy Grail. Some bathed in fountains of youth. And others even tried to anger the gods. But in the second calendar year, one man stumbled upon the secret accidentally. His name was Jeremiah, son of Simon. One morning in a hungover daze, Jeremiah walked right off of a mountain, hungover daze, but he didn't have his scratch on him. He thought it was a fluke but clearly it was not. Something was different and he tried to piece it together. What did he do last night? Did he drink from the Holy Grail? No. Did he bathe in the fountain of youth? No. Did he anger the gods? Well, maybe, but not on purpose. All Jeremiah had done the previous night was go to a party, consume some alcohol and have sex with someone. And then he realized: that was it. Go to a party, drink some alcohol and have sex with someone. If you did it every night, you would live forever. But of course, that would mean if you stopped for one night, you would lose your immortality and never get it back. So he assembled a crew. Jacob and Elizabeth were in charge of finding the parties. Luke and Martha were in charge of finding the alcohol. And Jeremiah and Joel were in charge of keeping everyone in tip-top hygiene to make it easier for them to, as they said in the olden times, get laid. The six of them worked in perfect harmony, partying, drinking, having sex every night, carrying on like this for centuries. Without aging, never getting hurt, never getting sick. But soon, the members started dropping off. Jacob decided to pull up his bootstraps and get a college degree. Elizabeth wanted to start a family. And Luke was simply ready to die. Joel, Martha and Jeremiah were the only ones left and Jeremiah and Martha had already decided it was time for them to leave this earth. They imparted their dying wisdom unto, Joel telling him to carry on the lifestyle, but to only reveal the secret to those who were worthy. When they died, Joel did as he was told and set off into the wilderness to party for the rest of his days. Remaining immortal was easier in a pack, so he formed herd after herd, and group after group and when he was finally ready to die he instructed the surviving members to do the same. These exclusive gangs called themselves Party Crews and they alone held the secret of immortality from the outside world. Until now... [Music] 1 Missisippi, 2 Mississippi, 3 Mississippi, 4 Mississippi, 5 Mississippi, 6 Mississippi, I win. Oh shit. Wait, no it's, I'm okay. Oh thank God. Uh, guys? Do you think it's someone trying to taunt us like maybe they know... you know... and they're trying to smoke us out. I don't know why anyone would want to do that. Maybe they're fans trying to pay their respects. Maybe it's a whole new group altogether. Maybe they've never even heard of us. Either way we're gonna find out in 3 hours [Music] Party Crew! Party Crew! Party Crew! [Applause] They look exactly like... Yeah... Like carbon copies... Yeah but we can't just come right out and ask them if they're... you know... If the cat's out of the bag we're gonna be in a world of shit so we just have to trick them into telling us so let's split up. Hi, Stephen, host of the party nice to meet you -Chad. -Hey. -Hi. What you got there? A phone. Cool. Got one of those myself. Fat metal thing in storage I keep it tucked away. Nice fat cord attached to it too. How are you enjoying the party? It's fine. Just wanted some quiet for a second. Striking out, huh? No, I just... You know you shouldn't party so much, it's not good for the body. How do you know how much I party? And you definitely shouldn't drink so much, that'll kill you early. Oh yeah? When you get a cut on, on like your hand or something about how long would you say that takes to heal? What? Hey do you have an aux cord? A what? An aux cord. Ox like a cow? No aux like A-U-X. Wouldn't that be pronounced "Oh" like French? Do you really not know what that is? Are you like a bluetooth family or something? Bluetooth? I'm gonna drink everyday, party every night and I'm gonna live forever. How did you find out about this? Uh Chad's grandpa told us. So this is your first night doing it? Yes. Did you tell anybody else? No, just the three of us and Chad's grandpa. Good let's keep it that way. Hey wait... Like would you say that you were worried about cuts and stuff like because of the gangrene and amputation and whatnot or would you say like Hey man, I ain't afraid of no knife. Okay well an aux cord is something you plug into your phone so that you can play whatever music you want instead of having to rely on like whatever CD you have. This is available for purchase? Yeah pretty sure you could get it anywhere. Roger that aux, A-U-X. You're so out of touch with everything. It's kinda cute So it's true? If you party every night, drink something and have sex then you'll live forever... Ssshhh, don't say it out loud. Okay sorry but but but if you don't do it for one night does that mean you go back to your normal age---oh stop talking. Okay sorry but that means it's true Oh my god it's them. Their grandchildren They even smell like them. Okay it's definitely them. Oh I have so many more questions to ask but wait I kind of came out a little strong they might not want to come back tomorrow night.

Oh yeah definitely. well so maybe that's what we can be for these kids. Like Mentors. We shouldn't tell them about this like they don't know about us at all. No but that's why we have to be sneaky man like sneaky Mentors yeah we could each only be assigned a one kid so it doesn't get confusing okay Yeah we should each only be assigned to I call Rebecca I call Chad I called one kid so it doesn't get confusing.
