(Reverend) Our Lord Jesus Christ has told us that to enter the kingdom of heaven we must be born again of water and the spirit. He has given us baptism as the sign and seal of this new birth. (Harrison cries) No, no, no. (Reverend) I baptise you in the name of the Father... - (Harrison continues crying) - ...and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. OK. I've known Lucy since we was both 11. It was our first day at big school. I remember I was so scared because I got sent to take a note to the office. I never did find the office. But in the empty corridors I did find Lucy. (Clark) Wow! It was seven years after that that I had my Lola. And for a while, whilst I was up to my elbows in nappies, Lucy was being scraped from the club floors. (Lucy, laughing) Hey! So although it took a while, I'm thrilled that she is now a mum and I get to be godmother to beautiful baby Harrison. - Cheers. - Shut up. (Paul) Excellent. Well done. (Lynn) Thank you. Ooh! No, Daddy's cake. Do you wanna see a dance me and Chloe made up at school? Yeah. (Video playing on tablet) - Is that you? - Yeah. Well done, babe. That's so cool. Well done. I won first place for dance on sports day. - Did you? - Yeah. Loles, why are you lying? You got a star for effort. (Lola) It's the same, I still won. (Lynn) You didn't win. And don't lie. - (Lola) I'm not lying. - Look at him. He's traumatised after all that bloody organised child abuse. (Lucy) Clark, stop being such a fucking prick. Sorry, Lynn. We're really happy that you convinced us to do it. (Pub Landlord) And the next prize up is a luxury spa basket. The lucky number is? For a lucky lady, hopefully. - 338. - 338? Anyone out there? We got number 338. (Pub Landlady) 338? (Pub Landlord) 338. Come on, one of you has got it. We'll be resuming back onto this in ten minutes' time. So please feel free to go and spend some money behind the bar and listen to a bit more music. (Indistinct dialogue) Cheers, darling. (♪ BILLIE PIPER: "Something Deep Inside") ♪ The first time that it crossed my mind, I kept on pushing it aside ♪ It's such a strong emotion ♪ Second time it's plain to see, this feeling rushing over me ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ And unknown to me... ♪ (Daytime TV playing in the background) (Lynn) I saw an advert for the safari park on TV this morning. (Scoffs) Safari park? Just thought it would be nice, for us to go out as family. Be a nice day out. Lola, for the fourth time, can you come and get your school shirt, please? (Sighs) - (Presenter) 'And here she is.' - (Audience clapping and cheering) (Presenter) 'I know! I know!' I'll pick you up after school like normal, all right? Yeah. Hello. Hello. Look at you smiling. I don't know what's got into him today. He's been a right little angel. Ain't ya? You don't fancy having a fag with me, do ya? I'm shitting it. Yeah. Of course. Thanks, babe. I don't deserve you. - Shameless. - Shut up. Clark, can you watch Harrison a moment? Do I look all right? - Yeah, you look good. - OK. I'm so scared. It's just gonna be a cup of tea and a fag. It's nothing official or anything. - She hated us. - No, we hated her. And you said yourself, you need a bloody degree to wipe someone's arse these days. I'm a mum, I'm a wife. I know it's old-fashioned but I'm good at it. I'm not gonna go in there and sweep her floors. Yeah, but how do you know you can't do something if you haven't even tried it? How about we go out for a drink and a dance on Saturday, yeah? Something to celebrate your new life as a working girl. I ain't even got the job yet. Be good. Babe, I'm gonna go back cos I'm fucking freezing. All right. Do you want me to call you when I'm done? Yeah. Good luck. - You don't need it, honest. Love ya. - Oh, thank you. - Good luck, babe. - Bye. Love ya. (♪ Dance music playing) Hi. I'm not late, am 1? Nah. Give me one minute. (Sighs) God, it's been ages. You look great. You look exactly the same. So, I know we're mates and everything but I thought I'd try and keep it professional, you know? Yeah, of course. Just looking for your CV. I can't remember seeing it. Actually, since leaving school I've just been a stay-at-home mum. Oh! I did a bit of work experience but this would be my first proper job. Right. So... what made you wanna start work now? You know Paul was in the military? And he got injured, so... Oh, yeah. Oh, God! Did he see, like, loads of dead bodies and that? No. He wasn't in, like, a war zone or anything. He was doing a training exercise. He's taken it quite bad because he thought he was gonna be, like, an action hero or something. But now he's just at home. Right. So, you wouldn't exactly say you were passionate about hair? No. Have you seen this? I have to be honest with you, Lynn, and say this is a job that's usually taken on by a school leaver. Is that not gonna bother you? No. (Football playing on TV in the background) Babe, you seen my hand bag? No. So, what do you think? Blast from the past, innit? - I knew it was too young for me. - No, I didn't mean that. - (Sighs) - (Slams door and goes upstairs) What are you doing? You look fine. Lynn, what are you doing? (Tuts) It's all about you, innit? You squeeze into clothes from ten years ago and it's my fucking fault you look like shit. (Lucy and Clark shrieking and giggling) (Harrison crying) (Shrieking and laughing) (Lynn) You're not even ready yet? (Lucy) Sorry. He was just showing me this kung-fu thing. (Clark) It's not kung-fu, it's jiu-jitsu. There's a massive difference. Shh. You're looking good, Lynn. Special occasion? You didn't tell him? (Clark) What? We're going Bridge Street for a drink and a dance. (Harrison crying) (Clark) Are you really going? Could have guessed you'd pick that fucking meat market. Why the fuck are you trying to speak to me like I'm some sort of fucking prostitute? We went there when we were teenagers, that's why. I bet when you went there as teenagers you acted like little fucking prostitutes. Fuck off, you fucking idiot. - (Harrison continues crying) - (Clark) Come on. Shh... You all right? You all right? (Lucy) What is wrong with him? He can't be fucking hungry again. - (Clark shushes Harrison) - Fuck's sake! You both need to calm down. Luce, go upstairs and get ready. Give him here a minute. (Clark) Go on, go and get your make-up on. Who the fuck are you talking to? You dickhead! (Lynn) It's OK. (Gurgles) - Are they scaring you? - (Door slams) There we go. Is Harrison a handsome little boy? Oh yes, he is! (Door opens and closes) I'm sorry. Is he OK? Yeah, I think he just needed a cuddle. I've left him downstairs with Clark, he's just feeding him. Right. It's weird for you, innit, like, the age gap and everything? No, I just think he needs to grow up. And anyway, kinda got used to the idea of you being a dirty cradle snatcher. Stop. - Lynn, do you ever wonder, like... - What? Don't know, do you ever, like, wonder if you'd be able to love them? Harrison? Luce, no one said it'd be easy. You don't look a day over 21. No one would even know you got a kid. (Lucy) Thank you! - Freedom at last. Cheers! - Cheers! Ooh! Oh, my God, that's disgusting. It's fucking beautiful. Oh, my God! Look, isn't that what's-his...? What's his name? - Tim. Tim something... - It's Tim... - Tim McCurtain. - Tim McCurtain, yeah! Fucking heck, he has changed. - Do you know what? - What? We need to go and speak to him. - Oi, oi. - Thank you. Jesus Christ, Lynn and Lucy in the flesh. - Cheers. - Cheers. So, er... what are you ladies up to these days, then? Oh, I just had my little boy and Lynn runs her own salon. Wow, good for you. (Lynn) What about you? What are you doing? I'm an estate agent. You know, at school there was a lot of rumours about you two. Yeah, like, that you were, er... you know, lesbians. You know, teenage boys and their fantasies! Yeah, you, Lucy, everyone wanted to bang you. And, er... you, though, Lynn, you... ...you've really grown into yourself. You know what, though, they were right. - About what? - About us. We're together. I thought you just said you've got a little boy. - Yeah, it's our little boy. - What?? Yeah, all we needed was some spunk. And let's be honest, you can get that anywhere. No, you're joking. Babe, show him the tattoos. Shame, innit? (♪ PARIS HILTON: "Stars Are Blind") - Ah... listen. - Oh, my God, is this...? - We love this song. - This is our song. Sorry, Tim. - See you later. - Bye. ♪ Some people never get beyond their stupid pride ♪ But you can see the real me inside ♪ And I'm satisfied, oh no, oh ♪ Even though the gods are crazy, even though the stars are blind ♪ If you show me real love, baby, I'll show you mine ♪ I can make it nice or naughty, be the devil and angel, too ♪ Got a heart and soul and body... ♪ - I'm fucked.

Obviously what we don't want is for hair to linger so you will actually have to be making yourself aware of when a cut is coming to an end. - Yeah. - OK? Towards yourself. Not like this. Come to the kitchenette. I'll show you how we do our teas and coffees. (Sam) What? (Janelle) I sent her to do the toilets. Should keep her busy. (Sam) So I take it you two weren't best mates at school then? (Janelle) She made my life hell. Her and her best mate. - (Sam) Why? - (Janelle) Cos I'm Asian, innit? Oh, God. Know what we called her, though? (Sam) What? (Janelle, laughing) The Pig. (Sam) Brutal! I love it. (Janelle) I mean, you only have to look at her to know that she's white trash. You're married with kids, aren't you, Lynn? Yeah. What about you? Twice divorced. Highschool sweethearts, ain't it, Lynn? - Me and Paul? - (Janelle) Mm-hmm. Yeah. Are you still best mates with Lucy... what's her name? - Lucy Parker? - (Janelle) Mm. Yeah. Do you remember that rumour that was going around - that you two were, like, a thing? - Oh, God, yeah. I don't know where people got those sick ideas from. I didn't mean sick like that, I mean... It's a bit of a strong word, "sick", isn't it? It was stupid, we was never together. (Paul tapping on keyboard) - You all right, babe? - Yeah. You? Yeah. I'm gonna need this after the day I've had. How was it? She's a bloody cow. - How's this now? Janelle? - Yeah. You think she would have changed after all these years, but... nope. Still the same Janelle. - What are you looking at? - Nothing. Looks a bit more interesting than nothing. Why are you on their page again? You're so judgemental, man. So you're telling me you got a 10-year-old daughter upstairs and that you wanna go around fucking other people? No. No, that's not what I'm saying. - So what are you saying? - Look, people in marriages explore. It's not a big deal. The world's changing, babe. (Lynn) Lola, you're not bloody skiving again. Now get your arse downstairs and get your breakfast. (Lola) All right, no need to shout. (Lynn) Paul, would you deal with your daughter for once? I've actually gotta be somewhere today. (Paul) All right, all right! Lola, get a move on. I mean now. (TV) 'The first strike misses so they reload 'and the colonel orders new adjustments. 'This time it's a direct hit.' (♪ Dance music playing) (Overlapping chatter) Yeah, so... just there, babe. Put it down. There you go. How many sweeteners did you put in there? - Two. - That's all right. (Caroline) You're on time, as usual. Shall I take your coat here? (Mrs Vosper) Yes, please. Hi. Sorry. Would you like a tea, coffee or water? - Any sugar? - (Costumer) No sugar. Thank you. Hi. Are you all right? Would you like a tea, coffee or water at all? I'll have a tea, please. No sugar. Thank you. Here, do you know what happened to me today? - No. - Well, I was walking down the road and... Yeah? And I saw the ambulance and the paramedics. - Where was this? - Down Elm Wood. (Caroline) Lynn? You live down Elm Wood, don't you? Yeah. (Mrs Vosper) I'm sure it's number 62 cos it's not far from where I live. I think someone must've had an accident quite near that home. (Caroline) Well, we'll soon find out. You know what it's like round here. Nosy Nora looking through the windows. (Caroline) Yes, there's always a nosy Nora. - That's not too hot for you, is it? - (Mrs Vosper) No, that's fine, thank you. (Door opens and closes) (Panting) (Lucy screaming) I don't want you to take my baby. (Sobbing) Lucy! Lucy. (Ambulance engine starts) (Mobile phone vibrating) Is that her? No. (Caroline) I couldn't sleep either. I myself lost a little one. Oh, God! I'm so sorry. I'm here if you need to talk. I mean that. Thanks. Good night, Lynn. Night. (Lucy's voicemail) 'Hi, you got through to Lucy's phone.' (Beep) Please call me back. (Janelle) Oh, my God, here she is. (Clears throat) Morning, Lynn. (Lynn) Morning. (Janelle) Can you imagine? (Costumer) Well, no one's seen them in two days. (Sam) Some people still think they're at the hospital, right, Lynn? She's the mum's best friend. Yeah, Lynn. Did you hear anything from her yet? No. My God! - (Investigator) Morning. - (Janelle) Morning. (Investigator) I'd like to speak to Lyndsey Miller, please? So, would you say he was violent? He's not violent, he's just... They'd had an argument the night we was going out, but... ...it was nothing, really. Can someone tell me what's going on, please? Clark's been arrested. I don't think I need to tell you that it's serious. And Lucy? We found no reason to charge her. Have you heard from her? No. Look, one more thing. Would you be willing to talk about these things as a witness in court if that was necessary? - In court? - Yes. Yeah. OK. Thanks for your time. Lucy? Babe, how long have you been back? Just a couple of days ago. They took my phone off me. Just came out cos I needed something to eat. Go in the till? Babe, you can't eat this crap. Come back and have dinner with us, yeah? - Sorry, is there a problem? - No. (Film playing on TV upstairs) I got you some ice cream. - I'll put it down there for you. - Thanks. (Sighs) So, where you been, Luce? They put me in a B&B and... ...told me to stay there, but I couldn't. Do you feel OK to talk about what happened? (Sighs) On the... Sunday... ...Clark disappeared. Probably punishing me for going out. And at some point he came home. I was so relieved. And then he told me that he'd... ...he'd seen this ex, Jodie. I can't explain the feeling, Lynn. I was furious. And I got some, like, scissors, and just... ...started cutting up some of his clothes and his games and stuff. He went mental. And what about Harrison? Clark was... He started packing some of his things downstairs. And... ...me and Harrison were upstairs in the bedroom. And he was, like... He was, like, crying really loud. And I just... I was in a state, Lynn. I just needed to sleep. And I was thinking, like... ..."'He's your bloody son too. You can't just run away from him." - And I went back upstairs. - With Harrison? He was downstairs with Clark. Then next thing, like... ...Clark just started, like, shouting... like, shouting for me to come down. And Harrison was doing this crying, but it was different. Like, it was, like, raspy. (Sobbing) Clark called an ambulance. And all we could do was wait. It was quite... It was quite obvious by then that he'd gone. And then they arrested Clark, is that right? How do you know? - People are just talking about it. - Who told ya? Just, like, people talking about it. Is that what happened? They think that, like... They think he shook him... ...like, to stop him crying. (Continues sobbing) Hey... Shh. We ain't gonna talk about this now, OK? We'll talk about it later. You can't go back there on your own. Stay here with us, yeah? Let me go and get you a blanket and a toothbrush. - (Paul) Babe? - Mm? You need to try and get some sleep. Yeah. Loles wanted to say something to you. Come on, Loles. Show her, then. I thought we could have some special bracelets, to remember Harrison. Thank you. Give it to her. Thank you. (Man) You're having a laugh. Beat the shit out of your kid, then rub everybody's face in it? You're having a laugh, you fucking vermin! Oi, look at me! You are fucking vermin! Sorry, I'm just using some of your make-up. Are you going somewhere? Yeah. I'm just gonna go and try and see Clark. Clark? Yeah. Do you think that's a good idea? Yeah. I just really need to see him. Can I use your phone to check the train times, please? Yeah. Thanks. Thank you. Right, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna go but I'll be back this afternoon. (Overlapping chatter) (Janelle) Would you like tea, coffee or water? (Costumer) Coffee, please, no sugar. (Janelle) Lynn, did you hear that? Hello? Lucy? Paul? He won't see me. He said that I must have... done something to him while I was upstairs and then that I brought him down. So basically he's trying to get off by throwing you under the bus? They've convinced him that someone's to blame. But they don't know everything, do they, the police and doctors and stuff like that? Are you saying he's innocent? (Sighs) He's a monster, Luce. He's got a hold on you and you don't even realise it. (Lucy sobbing) He had, like, this really sick, like, sense of humour. He was really into them messed up video games and, like, horror movies. (Sam) I'd rip his fucking dick off. (Caroline) Girls. I thought we could all sign it, let her know we're thinking of her. - (Janelle) Is that for Lucy? - Yeah. (Sam) That's lovely. - They're lovely. - (Caroline) They're nice, aren't they? (Janelle) That's really nice, Caroline. (Caroline) Thank you. (Janelle) Right. My 11 o'clock is gonna be here in a minute. Ladies. Will you make sure it gets to her? I'll pop it in the kitchenette for ya. (Presenter speaks Hindi) - (Baby crying) - (Woman shouting) (Woman continues shouting and slapping baby) (Baby crying continues) (Shouting and slapping continues) (Kettle boiling) (Kettle finishes boiling) Are you sure you don't want anything? No, thanks. Thanks. So, when you say make-up...? Literally, like, lipstick, everything. From what she said... ...he's trying to get off by saying maybe she had something to do with it. Do you know what I think? What? There are just some people who should never reproduce. People think it's morbid. "Why on earth would you wear his ashes round your neck like that?" That's what they say. But I tell 'em... ...It's not about death. It's about life. - And not letting him go. - That's your son's ashes? Yeah. He was killed by a drunk driver on his eight birthday. The posh prick that did it had a bright future apparently. Turn up to court... ...In a crisp white shirt. Got off. Suspended sentence. That's crazy. Wait a minute. Have a look in there. Who do you see? Me. Well, I'll tell you what I see. I see a decent person, a kind person, a good mum. Mum? I'm hungry. I'll get you a snack, sweetheart. Mum? Yeah? If Lucy was horrible to the baby, then why is she still at our house? We don't know if she was mean to him, darling. We just know they couldn't look after him properly. - But she was mean to him. - Lola! She was mean, I saw it. What? When? When I went to watch a film at a sleepover. Why didn't you tell me this before? Dunno. I was too scared. (Lynn) Can you show Daddy what you showed me? "Why can't you shut up for once, you greedy little prick?" (Paul) Come here. Good girl. I hope you're gonna make it up to her. She wanted some trainers. I'll take her into town to get 'em. I just can't get it out of me head, something she said. What? She told me she was scared. That she didn't know if she could ever love him. You're telling me this and you won't even ask her to leave. We should be going to the police. (Janelle) Oh, my God, Lynn. Caroline told us everything. You poor thing. Always quite popular with the blokes, weren't she? Every guy she dated, like, at that time, he was all that mattered. So, like, every guy at the time, he was the love of her life and so... (Janelle) Right. (Sam) I'd watch out if I were you. Cos you'd be in a lot of shit if you was harbouring a child murderer. Something to think about. (TV playing in the background) (Lynn) Luce, we need to talk. Is that my phone? Why have you got my phone? (Mouths) Fuck. Perfume! Wow! "Ivy". - I've not heard of that one, have you? - No. Oh, wow! It's so sweet. Thanks, Lynn. - (Caroline) Do you want some bubbly? - (Lynn) Oh, yes, please. Get me ready for the dance floor later. Yeah, I don't think she wants to go now. Oh! I just thought, it's nice and cosy in here, isn't it? To be honest, I'm not really into birthdays. It's really sweet of you, Lynn. I'm just gonna... nip to the ladies'. (Toilet flushing) (Cubicle door opens) I like your new top. Tell Lola I said hi, yeah? (Janelle) I've literally tried everything, Caroline. All the apps. Sending positive vibrations out to the fucking universe. I wish someone would just come out and tell me what's wrong with me. I'm 27. I'm not gonna find anyone. (Caroline) You're still young enough for an 18-30. (Lucy giggling loudly at the bar) (Janelle) What's she doing here? - (Lucy) I've got a secret of my own. - Oh, have you? (Lucy) I'm the local fucking baby killer. (Man) Let's go back to yours and you can tell me all about it. (Lucy) What the fuck are you doing? All right. Sorry about that. See you later, yeah? Oi, Lynn. And your new fucking mates. Do you know what they used to call you at school? They called you the Pig. The fucking Pig. And you know Paul? Well, Paul was the fucking Pig Fucker. - (Barman) What you doing? - (Lucy) Yeah. - (Barman) Mind your language. - (Lucy) No, it's true. - (Barman) Calm down, calm down. - I'm all right. Did you just fucking spit in my face? What are you fucking spitting in my fucking face! You fucking cunt! Fuck off! - (Barman) Leave off, OK? - (Lucy) You fuck off as well! Fucking... fucking bitches the lot of you! - Fuck off me! - (Barman) Fuck off out! You don't believe her, do ya? She's trying to divide us. It won't work. (Janelle) I'd never say that, Lynn. She's a compulsive liar anyway. Always has been. Right, come on. Well, cheers. - (Sam) Happy birthday. - (Lynn) Cheers. (Janelle) Cheers. (♪ Dance music playing across the street) - Are you OK, yeah? - Yeah. Sure? She doesn't know where little Lola goes to school, does she? We just don't know what she's capable of. Yeah, but she ain't a child snatcher. Are you defending her? No. People should know what you've been through. You've got a lot to offer. (Janelle) We'll do like a little reveal at the end, like on telly. (Caroline) That'd be lovely. (Sam) I love the way your mind works. (Lynn) It's just been so long since I've had me hair cut. (Sam) Bit of faith, please? (Caroline) I swear, you will not gonna recognise yourself. (Janelle) Relax! We've got this all under control. You are gonna feel like a brand new woman when we're done. We're closed. Can't you fucking read? I want my hair cut. (Sam) Fucking cheek. (Lucy) I've got money. (Janelle) You need the practice, innit Lynn? Lynn? One, two, three. Ta-da! What's wrong? Don't you like it? I love it. It's just so... different. Oh, babe, don't cry. Don't be silly. (Overlapping chatter) So, the way this would work is that every time we do a run, if each parent was to walk three or four kids, in the mornings and in the afternoons, it means that none of the kids would have to go to school unaccompanied anymore. So we just accept it, do we? Living in fear while she carries on like nothing's happened? (Caroline) It's a start, isn't it? Lynn's worked really hard on this. No. She's right. Given everything that's happened, we need to stick together. We need to let her know she's not wanted around here. You know? I got pregnant when I was 16. It wasn't planned. And I had no qualifications. It's, like, I could see the way people looked at me. I knew what they were thinking. At best all I'd ever be is a mum. I was ashamed of that. But you know, the one good thing to come out of all this is that I've realised being a mum is one of the hardest jobs in the world. And it's up to us to defend ourselves and our kids, even if they refuse to. - (Man) Well done. - (Woman) Well said. (Clapping) You did really good tonight. Really? Really. I have to admit, though... - What? - Well... I love the new hair. Can I get a kiss? You don't deserve it. I know. (Woman) You all right? Sorry we're late. I was trying to find her PE kit. No, Loles, imagine if you'd have had to miss PE! - Come on. - Anyway, be good, yeah? Have a good day. Thanks. (Knocking) Excuse me. (Car engine running) Lucy? (Mrs Vosper) Do you think she's OK? Lynn? Lynn? Lynn? She wasn't your friend. She was never your friend. You said it yourself. I need you to hold it together. For Lola's sake. For when she gets home, yeah? (Mobile phone vibrating) - She's in here. - Thank you. - I'll leave you two alone. - All right, cheers. Loles, please stop crying. Listen... ...Auntie Lucy felt bad about what happened to Harrison. And that's why she did what she did. It proves we were right. Lucy was a bad person. Do you understand? Darling, don't cry. I didn't really see her being mean to Harrison. She only shouted. I don't know why I made it up. (Prosecutor) 'OK, Lola. 'The camera is on and we're gonna start now, OK? 'If you don't the answer to any of these questions 'that's absolutely fine. 'All you have to do is say, "I don't know" or "I don't understand". 'Is that gonna be all right? Yeah? 'OK. 'Now, do you know why your mum brought you here today?' 'Because I saw Auntie Lucy shake baby Harrison.' (♪ Dance music playing) You all right? Oh, hiya. You all right? - Yeah, I've got an appointment at two. - At two? OK. - Oh, is it Lynn? - Yeah. OK, you're with Janelle. If you just wanna take a seat, we'll be with you in a minute. All right, thank you. I still don't like that one. Who else was... an option at the time? - Ah, there was Mick. - (Sam) Oh, dear. How small are we talking? - (Janelle) Small, babes. - (Sam) Disappointing. - (Janelle) Yeah, really disappointing. - (Sam) I can see why you two didn't last. (Janelle) Yeah, well... Hiya. Can I get you a drink or anything? Tea, coffee, water, juice? - Nothing? - I'm good, thanks. So, what are we doing for you today, Lynn? Just a trim, please. - Just a little one, yeah? - Yeah. - So, how have you been? - Yeah, so-so. You? Not great, actually. Really? Actually, I've come here to tell you and the girls something. Right. What's that? Can you imagine? They're sending Clark Hanwell back to the area. It's literally gonna be like waking up every day and... ...staring evil in the face across the street from you. I've got a family. I need to protect my daughter. Sounds horrible. I'm just gonna go get a tissue. I was planning on setting up another residents' meeting. I was thinking you and the girls can come with me. To be honest, Lynn, that all got to be a bit of a mess, didn't it? (Van doors open and close) (Lynn) Paul? - Paul! - What? He's here! - Who? - Clark.
