All passengers travelling to Doha are requested to go through security. Are you a housemaid? Even I hold a work visa of a house maid. I have been doing this job for six years. But when I got tired of working as a housemaid, I left to my native. But because of my financial problems, I came back. People think that we have a good time working in Saudi Arabia. What's your name? Aswathi. When you reach your employer's house, they will change your name. They'll call you with different names. Or else, they'll address you as the housemaid. Where is your native place? It's near Pattambi. My native place is at Kondotty. When did you reach here? This morning. Does your sponsor know that you are here? Before I took the flight, Usman, who sent me the visa, had called. He said that he'd come to the airport along with the sponsor. They will come, but only when they feel like. Sometimes, we have to wait for days here. That's what happens here. I don't know when my sponsor will be here. 'Flight number SV535..' - Come on Let's sit there. - '...has arrived.' All passengers travelling.. 'Flight number SV562 to Dubai..' Even they are housemaids. They are from different countries. Now you are one of us. You cannot roam around in this outfit in Saudi once you go out of the airport. You must cover your head even if you're not a Muslim. It's a law in this country. Here, cover your head with this stole. And wipe off that bindi from your forehead. 'KHADDAMA' Don't hurry. Look carefully. The police found this body near the road that goes from Riyadh to Dammam. We didn't find any ID on him. But if we can find his address we can send his body to his family. I think it's about three months now, right? - Yes. There's a tattoo on his left arm which spells out as 'Ram' in Hindi. That's how they confirmed that he's an Indian. No matter if you are from Bengal, UP or Bihar if you remain unidentified after your death the authorities here would call you an unknown Indian. When I saw his photo, I thought I knew him. But the guy I knew had a mole under his nose. But he doesn't have a mole. Are you sure about that mole? Why can't you take a clear look? If this guy doesn't have a mole, why should I waste my time? Razak, you own a shop here. Don't waste your time on these things that don't benefit you. If nobody claims the body, then the hospital will bury it. That's right. But there must be some family waiting for this guy and the money he sends. And if they don't get any news about him they'll curse him thinking that he forgot his family and is living a good life here. I don't want anyone cursing him, Ramesh. Come fast. I can't risk my job because of you. The company called me twice. It's time to deliver the next load. Did someone identify the body? - No. He just needed a mole. - What? A guy came to identify his body. But he was looking for a guy with a mole. Razak.. Just wait. I guess you recognise that body now. Am I right? No, I don't care whose dead body is that. It cost me 150 riyal to come here from Dammam in a cab. You'll have to pay me that money. 150 riyal? The cab is not mine, Razak. I have the photo of that dead body. I'll let you know if anyone recognises the body. Bye. - Okay. Are you happy with your loss? It's okay. I'm not worried about the cash. I can tell that. Razak, we are working here to earn money. Why are you wasting the money meant for your family on other people? I don't understand what happiness one gets by thinking about only oneself and his family. Fine. I won't argue with you. You're not going to change. My mom's returning to Kerala today. I forgot about that. Hello. - Dear. Mother-in-law is waiting since morning. Your absence is making her restless. When are you coming home? Are you planning to come at the last moment? I'm on my way, Serena. You tell her to be a little patient. Salim will be there now. Just come fast. - Give me. Razak. One of our relatives wanted a holy book. I forgot to buy it. Please buy it for me. And buy some fresh dates as well. Jamila told me to bring something from Saudi Arabia. Okay, mom. I'll get it. Okay. I want you to reach home as soon as possible. Just hurry. I can at least spend some more time with you. I'll be there soon. Varghese. - Yes. - Let's go through the Friday market. - Okay. Hello. Where? Which site? Okay, I'll be there. I'll come there right away. Varghese. - Yes. Don't go through the Friday market. Go to Sana. - Why? An accident happened at the construction site there. A man is in a critical stage. Let's have a look there and then we can go. But we.. - We still have lots of time. Oh, God! Oh, God.. What happened? - We are in trouble, Razak. We can't even help people nowadays. What happened? - He fell from the ladder. Oh, dear Lord.. These people will kill me today. I can't endure the pain. Get him to the hospital now. He doesn't have a passport or work permit. We'll get into trouble if we go with him. You have good contacts in the hospital and with the police. Razak, don't get involved in this. We are going to the airport. Let's go. Come. How did he get here without any documents? We just helped him, Razak. When we don't have enough workers we call workers from outside. He didn't have a passport or a work permit. But still, we helped him, so that he can earn something. I had told them that I feel dizzy when I climb. But they didn't believe me. What's his name? - Chand Basha. Please, take me to a hospital. If we take care of him now, what about your mom? Stop talking and help him. Take him.. He'll need an X-ray and scanning. He broke his back. My leg.. Razak never listens to me. Why can't you stay for some more days? Because I have to take care of the goats there. I handed my job to Jamila while coming here. I can't always do that. Dad never comes on time. He is always late. He's more concerned about others than his own family. Even his father was like that. He always used to do others' work first. But this is not our state. We can't do anything we want here. He took ten years to fulfil his promise of taking you to Hajj. He delays in family matters. Thank God. Finally, he brought me here. We should be happy. Please tie up this box, Salim. I can't do it properly. The flight is at 7 o'clock, right? - Yes. Serena, is it okay if I drop her to the airport? I don't think Razak will be here on time. There might be a big queue of people who are returning after visiting Hajj. I'll tell Razak to come directly to the airport. Be quiet, Salim. I won't leave until Razak comes back. I am serious. I don't care if I miss the flight. Can I go now? - Okay. Did you get all the things, Salim? Your mother said that she wouldn't leave until you arrive. Keep this as well. All his money gets spent on helping others. He doesn't save any money at all. It's been years since he's planning to build a house of our own. Dad said that he'd build a house before the next rainy season. - Be quiet. Eight rainy seasons have passed by. Did he do anything yet? You will get a house, Serena. Please don't complain about him all the time. Mom is about to leave. And you are still complaining to her about me, Serena. Nobody is complaining about you, dear. She says it because she loves you. Of course. But she calculates my love for her on the basis of the pace at which I construct our house. If I try to get that work done faster she feels I love her. Am I right, Serena? It's already late. You should leave now. We can discuss love later. Come, Mother-in-law. Don't forget to meet Dr. Damodaran. - Okay. And check your B.P and diabetes. Let's go. Let me see you once again before leaving. I don't know when I'll see you again. Mom, please don't start crying now. Or else I'll start crying too. Please come. Hey. - Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. You are here early, Mr. Hamsa. What happened, dear? I'm going to the embassy today. Soon your problem will be solved. That Arab sponsor betrayed him. I know him. He won't cheat anybody. We know that, but the law doesn't. Even after working here for 30 years when our situation didn't improve I called my son here to help me. But look what happened now. My son is behind bars now. Some people at the embassy will help us. Rasheed will be released soon. You are helping us a lot. I know you'll need some money. This is all I have. If I had collected money for these works, I would've become rich. Please keep it with you. Please get him something to drink. No, Razak. I'm not in a mood for snacks and drinks. The stocks are about to get over. Our last payment is still pending. We'll pay that. Now get me a recharge coupon for 100 riyal. You can't ignore your shop's responsibilities like this, Razak. You know what happened with Datta's shop. I hope your shop doesn't get shut like his shop. Don't blame us then. Even to spend on other people, you'll have to earn money. I'll be fine. Not just one. I want two coupons for 100 riyal. It's no use anyway. You will finish it by evening by making calls for other people's needs. Such a waste. How is it? What's this, Ajith? This is not the news I informed you about. This looks like a detective novel. If we don't make the news a little interesting nobody will read it, Razak. People aren't interested to read real life stories now. I know. It's true that people who get tired of writing stories and novels, become journalists. Why do you play with the lives of these poor people on the basis of your doubts and assumptions? In the news about Surendran from Cherthala who got arrested for attacking his sponsor you wrote that the sponsor suspected that Surendran was having an affair with his wife and that led to the fight. Look where that matter has reached. - Well.. For you it's nothing. Now even if Surendran comes out of the jail and goes home he can't live with his wife. That innocent guy's wife left him. Hey, that's interesting. But that story is valuable only on the day when he gets out of jail. If I stay here any longer you'll make news about me too. I should leave before that. Hey, wait. There's one more news. I wanted to show you before I publish it. It's about a housemaid in Buraydah. We've been reported that she escaped from there two days ago, with gold and money. Look. Do you recognise her? Aswathi. Have you heard about her? No. - She's beautiful. A typical Malayalee girl from Kerala. - Yes. She doesn't look like she can steal. The climate of a desert and the nature of man is the same. It can change anytime, Ajith. You are right. There's no scope of creating a story using just a passport and her profile. We have to collect some more information about her. - Yes. Can you please try it? I'll try. Anyway don't make a fake story about this girl too. The lives of many people who are unknown to us may be unusual than a story. We are staying in Buraydah. It's 400 kilometres from Riyadh. It'll take maximum three and a half hours to reach there. You can enjoy the view until then. Because once you get inside the Arab's house you won't be able to go out at all. You must be hungry, right? You have waited for one and a half day at the airport. It's okay. - Okay. On the way.. - What are you blabbering? Look straight while you drive, you moron. Go left.. He can't see properly. He is instructing me to go left. He's been poking and irritating me with his stick since the last ten years. He tells me the direction by poking with his stick. For taking a left, he pokes me on the left shoulder. For taking a right, he pokes me on the right shoulder. And to go straight, he hits me on the head. Now I'm well aware of all the directions. But this old man still pokes me all the time. Go straight.. I know the direction, Sir. You don't have to poke me. What are you telling her? I was telling her about your family. This man's name is Khalid Ahmad Bin Said Mohammed. His son is our sponsor. Nawaf Ahmed Bin Khalid Muhammad. Then there is his wife, the sponsor's wife and their children. They are very well behaved. You'll know about them when you reach there. Enough! She'll learn everything. You don't have to teach her. He's saying that you'll learn everything on your own. Drive fast, you moron! I have a wish, ma'am. I want to kill this old man and spend the rest of my life in the jail in Saudi. This is the house. Please come, ma'am. Come.. This is our sponsor. Sir, this is the new housemaid. Passport.. He wants your passport. - Okay. You can go inside. Go straight and then take a left. Go on. Don't hesitate. Just come inside. I said, come here. Sameera, this is the new housemaid. What's your name? Name.. What's your name? Your name? Aswathi. Her name is Aswathi. Fatma.. We already have a cook. So you can do rest of the work. You'll have to look after the kids too. Fatma, she's the new housemaid from Kerala. Teach her everything properly. - Okay. Go and show her room. And give her a dress to change. Come. This is your room. Sari? - Yes. It suits you. I have seen saris in Hindi movies. Change your dress. You can't wear a sari here. Change your sari. "A new face." "A new face this time." "A new face." "A new face.." Wow! You look good. You look like a Muslim now. Aswathi is beautiful. She looks good in everything. Did you understand what Fatma said? I don't understand a word they speak. Don't worry, you will learn slowly. Even I couldn't understand anything at first. - Aswathi! The sponsor's wife is calling you. This is your first day. Be careful. "A new face." "A new face." Aswathi! Aswathi! Where were you? Come here! Don't cry.. It's okay.. Come inside! Keep an eye on Badarin. He's dirty. Go and clean him up. Then clean the floor. Take him indoor. Then clean the floor. Did you understand? Apply this medicine. It will heal by tomorrow. Is it hurting? - What? Is it paining? It's better now. - Okay. Who all are there in your family? House. Your family? My house is in Kerala. No. House? Oh, are you asking about my family? Father. Mother. Sister. Brother. Are you married? No, I'm not married. Where did you learn my language? Marriage is 'Kalyanam' in your language and 'Manikka' in mine. I like your language. I learnt it from Usman. Don't worry. I'll teach you Malayalam. - Really? I'll take you to my village too. Have you heard of Kerala? God's own country. It's not like this place. It's a place full of greenery. Everything is green there. It's a place full of trees. Trees.. It rains six months a year there. Have you ever got drenched in the rain? Rain.. - Yes. My house is near seashore. My dad is a fisherman. Mom, my sister and me used to stay at home. Sometimes, dad returned after 2-3 days. I used to wait for him. The sound of the sea at night is like music. Great. You guys are talking in your languages. People who listen to you will go mad. Do you even understand what she's saying? She's from Indonesia. When Tsunami hit her village she lost her family in that incident. She survived because she was at her relative's place at that time. When her relatives couldn't look after her they sent her here to work. They wanted someone to earn for them. Here. Keep this phone with you. Use it only at night. If they see you using it during the daytime they will beat you up. You can tell your family to call you. If you call them, it'll cost you a fortune. See you. Make a call. Usman.. Where the hell are you? The old man has started to cause trouble. Usman! - Yes. Polish my shoes. - Okay. Just stand somewhere first. Oh, dear Lord! He can't see properly. But he can see women even if she's standing a 100 mile away. Sometimes, he teases them. Just ignore him or else we will get into trouble. First, he used to torture Fatma. What is it? I was telling her to clean the floors properly. When you are here, you must speak in Arabic. Stop speaking in other languages. Do you understand? Aswathi.. She's calling you. - Usman. - Yes. Translate what I say to her. Okay, ma'am. She said to wash all the clothes properly. - Okay. Feed that fat kid when he wakes up. You must prepare the dinner tonight. They are going to the farmhouse to have a party and eat. They will want food when they return. Sad! Usman. - Yes. - Come on. - Okay. Here, hold this. I'll go to drop them. Yes, come. Why did you stop? Why did you stop singing? They have gone. Sing. - No. You sing. - No, I can't. I can't sing. You sing. - No! Sing.. Please! Sing. - No.. "Under the tree full of flowers" "for whom did you wait on that sunny day?" "The breeze there continues to sing a melodious song " "even if it stops drizzling." "Will you come with me" "without letting anyone know" "like the flowers" "of the 'Onam' festival?" "Under the tree full of flowers" "for whom did you wait on that sunny day?" "Someone was hiding" "between the rejuvenating sun rays." "Like a garland offered to a Goddess" "you came to me as an aroma of sandalwood." "The oceans faraway" "flowed silently." "Silently.." "Silently.." "Will you" "be there by my side" "in all the good and bad times" "of my life?" "Under the tree.." - 'If you stop drinking, smoking and fighting' 'I'll consider the proposal.' "For whom did you wait on that sunny day?" 'I stopped.' 'I stopped.' 'I stopped.' "The birds looking for food" "in the fields, will fly away." "Someone in a small house will weave dreams." "The paths will be filled with blossomed flowers." "One day" "those flowers will adorn your hair" "and make them beautiful." "Will you come with me" "without letting anyone know" "like the flowers of the 'Onam' festival?" "Under the tree full of flowers" "for whom did you wait on that sunny day?" "The breeze there continues to sing a melodious song " "even if it stops drizzling." "Will you come with me" "without letting anyone know" "like the flowers of the 'Onam' festival?" "Under the tree full of flowers" "for whom did you wait on that sunny day?" Usman is my friend's brother-in-law. He's going back to Saudi tomorrow. He said that he'd help to get me a visa. I might get a small job at first. Then I'll have to get a license from there. Usman said that if I get a job as a truck driver, I can earn a lot. Then all our problems will resolve in 2-3 years. Why are you quiet? You have to look after your dad's treatment and siblings' education. There's a lot of burden on you. And on top of that, you are repaying my dad's debts and looking after my family. It's okay. We are one family. Your problems are mine too. So we'll find a way to deal with it. I have become a decent husband. Isn't that enough for you? Then why can't you allow me to work? You know that I can still find a job. No, you don't have to work. I would rather prefer that you spend the money I earn. Okay, my darling? I don't understand why we have to get married. You should change this old mentality, we must be broad-minded. This is nothing serious. We are just having a fling. Don't forget that you are ruining her life, Usman. You have a wife and kids in your village. Exactly. They are in the village. But I want someone here. Shit! Sometimes, you need to ignore some things, ma'am. Ignore the things that don't concern you. Here. Your last month's salary. The sponsor gave it to me. This is 600 riyal. Six hundred riyal? But you said that I'd get.. I know that I said 800 riyal. But 200 riyal is my commission. Sometimes I pay her some cash for coming into my room. Not as payment, but as a token of love. I can arrange for that money only through these means. I have to look after my family in the village. I have to send money to them too. I'll send this cash to your family. Mom, come out. I think we have a letter. Is that Aswathi's letter? No, it's from the chit fund company. We must pay them soon. Oh, God. Why didn't Aswathi write to us? Mom, come here. It's a call from abroad. Hello. - Is this Aswathi's residence? Yes, who's this? I'm calling from Saudi Arabia. I want some details about Aswathi. It's from Saudi Arabia. Hello. Who's this? Where is my daughter? Why doesn't she call? Are you Aswathi's mom? - Yes. When was the last time Aswathi phoned you? Oh, is she okay? It's been more than five months since I heard from her. She used to call me and her husband's family every week. She sent us money for two months. Now she neither calls us nor does she write to us. We can't even reach her on her cell phone. What happened to my daughter? Who are you? We don't want any money. We just want to see her. Hello. Razak, tell me. Oh, did you call them? What was their reaction? Is it? Did you inform them about the news that was published here? How can I tell them about that news of their daughter from whom they haven't heard since six months? Tomorrow I'm going to Buraydah. I'll go to her sponsor and find out. Okay, I'll keep reporting you about the investigation. I know you want something to write in that Sunday's column. - Yes. Can I get some more news, please? I didn't get any breaking news. I had told you about Chand Basha. Write about him. That's not news. Even the journalists aren't interested in Chand Basha. I took that man to the hospital. What else can I do now? We can't keep him in the camp. When I called his native his wife told me not to send him back there. - Why? Look, he's a glutton. He eats food meant for four people. We are fed up of him. The food here isn't delicious. It's like eating bland food. So you guys ran away by ignoring me. It's been three days since I asked for a Chicken Biryani. But nobody cares. Let me make it very clear. I can't stay here if I don't get some good delicacies. Give them some cash for me. Take the money for my cigarettes too. Okay? Are you leaving? Wait till your plaster is removed. We'll make the arrangements for your deportation by then. Forget about sending me home arrange for my Biryani instead. Okay. There's an inspection in the camp this Friday. I'll lose my job if they find a man who doesn't work here. What can I do for that? Razak, you'll have to find a solution. Did I ask you to appoint a man without a work permit? That was a mistake. If you don't do anything, we'll throw him away somewhere. This is not Razak's business. Let's go. Razak, please.. Just keep him with you for two more days. I'll find a solution by then. Go away from here! I don't want to listen to you. That housemaid ruined our family's reputation. Just go.. Sir, if there has been a mistake from us, Indians we'll investigate. I'm coming from the embassy. I don't want to hear anything. You Malayalees aren't trustworthy. Aren't you a Malayalee too? If you don't leave this instant, I'll get you arrested. Get lost! What happened? Did you get to know anything? Today I came to know that there are swear words in Arabic too. It was his loss, that's why he's furious. After seeing his reaction I feel there's something fishy. If we investigate I'm sure we'll get some clue. What would be the outcome of it? Ajith Menon will get a news item and you'll lose some riyal. I'm not investigating this matter only to help him get a news. What if that woman is innocent? If so, she might have gone missing because of some reason. I'm a reputed officer. If the people outside come to know.. - Don't hit me, sir. ...that the servants in my house are engaged in adultery my reputation will be spoiled. So I'm not complaining to the police. But I have the right to punish you. - Please don't beat me. In spite of being a Muslim, you committed this sin. Even the God won't forgive you. He'll bless us for beating you. I'll kill you if you try to ruin our family's reputation. Don't beat me, sir. Where's that disgusting guy? I left you alive only because you have been with us for ten years. If you stay here any longer I'll get you arrested. So, go away! Don't give her even a drop of water. Fatma. They are all asleep. Food. You'll get sick if you don't eat anything. Go. If they see this, they will beat you up. I had warned you about this. But you both didn't listen to me. Hello. It's Usman. Hello. Ma'am, I made a mistake. I got punished for it too. I'm really worried for that poor girl. Those people will kill her. If she gets out of there I'll arrange a job for her somewhere else. I want you to help her to get out of there. What? What if they find out? No one will come to know if she gets out now. I'm in the backyard right now. Please, ma'am. Help her. There's an exit in your room which is covered with cardboard. You can reach the backyard if you come through that. I'm waiting there. Please let me talk to Fatma. I'll explain to her. Take it. - Hello. Usman. How did she escape? Tell us. She won't leave without your knowledge. Just tell us the truth. I don't know.. Why did Usman call you last night? Tell me! You can't keep this phone anymore. Over here.. Look carefully.. Look over there.. Yes, there.. Look carefully.. Who drowned? - It's Radhakrishnan. He jumped into the lake to save the kids who were drowning. He drowned while saving them. He is nowhere to be seen. - Look over there.. It's a deep lake. Don't go there.. Don't go there.. Get up! Here. Eat! We shouldn't give you to eat. What's this? Haven't you learnt to iron yet? Let me see how you iron them. Let me teach you how to iron. Working as a housemaid in Saudi Arabia is a very easy job. Those people have machines for everything. We just have to stand there and operate those machines. Usman told me about this job. The job is in the house where Usman works as a driver. He said that they'd pay her 800 riyal. It would be around Rs. 10,000. If we agree, he will send the visa as soon as possible. No, Sudheer. I can't send her to work as a housemaid in an unknown place. My son won't forgive me for that. It's okay, Father-in-law. I will go. Our prestige won't help us to solve our financial problems. It's better than staying at home and crying over our loss. Medicine. Here, apply it. Sleep.. Good night.. We don't want to send you. Hey, get up. Clean the house. We are going out. Hello. Usman. What happened, Aswathi? I can't take it anymore. If I stay here, I will die. They are torturing me a lot. It's been five months now. I haven't sent money to my home. I can't even make a call to my family through this phone. I have to go back somehow. What can I do? Please send me home. Is somebody there now? No, they went to the farmhouse. Then they'll return at night. Do one thing. Escape from there just like Fatma. Escape from there after the azan. After getting out, walk towards the right. You'll find a shop named Al Wahda. A friend, Mr. Abu, runs that shop. I'll inform him. He'll drop you at my place. I'm at Riyadh right now. Be careful. You'll have to pass through the gate. That watchman would be standing there. He shouldn't see you. I think this is your chance to escape from there. Usman. Don't think so much. I'll take care of everything once you reach Riyadh. Where did the housemaid go? - I don't know, sir. Get the car! Mr. Abu.. Mr. Abu.. Mr. Abu.. Did you start smoking too? - What can I say, John! I have to face the problems that come to me. Take this. Did you buy only one packet? This is Chand Basha. He'll be here until his plaster is removed. Please come, Chand Basha. - Oh, my Lord! Oh, Lord! In order to get deported to his village he'll have to surrender to the police and go to jail. How can I send him there with this broken leg? I'm really hungry. On the way, you had 'Parotta' and mutton chops. I don't know why, but when I smoke the food I ate gets digested fast. Don't you have an ashtray here? He's a good man. The only problem is that even his wife doesn't want him. He's from Kasaragod. He and his three kids survive on the food that his wife gets by working as a maid. If he goes there, he'll eat up all the food. That's why his wife said not to send him back. Wow, what a good man! Razak, please keep your social work outside. Don't bring it to home. We don't have a big house. We can't live here freely if a stranger comes and stays here. Moreover, it is illegal to let a man with no documents stay here. Serena, please adjust for some time. I took his responsibility. I can't leave him on the street. Make some more rice before the kids return from school. Or else there won't be any food for them. Hello. Tell me, Varghese. Right, that Usman. You found him! Where? I'll be there soon. Where is the ashtray? Let it lie on the floor. Serena, I'll be late. Do one thing. Make an omelette for him. He's our guest. Tell her that I would like it spicy. Make some tea and put it in a flask. I have the habit of drinking tea at regular intervals. You are Usman, right? - Yes. I've been looking for you since some days. It was really difficult to find you. Who are you? What's the matter? You used to work as a driver in an Arab's house in Buraydah, right? That was a long time ago. I don't do that anymore. - Okay. But you know where Aswathi is, don't you? Who is Aswathi? I don't know. You gave Aswathi a job as a housemaid in that Arab's house. Oh, that girl. I shouldn't have got her that job. I helped her so that she could solve her financial problems. But look what she did after she started earning. So you read everything in the news. - Yes. I went to meet Aswathi's sponsor. He abused you as well. Why did you leave that place? That's none of your business. Are you saying that you have nothing to do with that theft? Oh, I see. Are you trying to blame me for that? I already have enough problems. Please tell us what you know about her. We just want to save that poor girl. That's the reason I gave her a job here. I am not ready to invite trouble by helping her again. Usman. I didn't ask her to steal or to escape. Why are you so concerned about her? Why does it matter now? Varghese, do you think he was telling the truth? No. It's obvious from his looks that he is a fraud. He knows where that girl is. Water.. Water. Give her water. Are you going towards Riyadh? What? Riyadh? Riyadh? Do you want a lift to Riyadh? Yes. Riyadh. Riyadh. Do you want to go to Riyadh? Yes, Riyadh. - Come with me. Get in. Come on. Get in. Oh, God! Stop the truck! Stop the truck! Where are you taking me? Stop! Stop the truck! Stop the truck! Where are we going? Stop the truck! I want to go to Riyadh. Stop! Stop the truck! Stop the truck! Stop the truck! Stop! Get down.. This is Riyadh for us today. Don't be scared. Get down. Get down. Get down, beautiful. Come, beautiful. Come.. Come. Sit here. Hurry up. Open it. Don't worry. Go and sit there. Eat. Why is she so scared? Did you do anything? No, I didn't do anything. Eat.. Look at her. She fears that we'll eat her. We didn't even do anything to her and she's already scared. What would happen when we do something to her? Oh, God! Hey.. Go.. Escape from here. Or else they'll.. Go! Run away before they find you. Run away from here. Don't stay here. Go! Run and save yourself. Go! Go! Don't stop anywhere! Where did you take her while we were praying? Speak up, you dog! Where is she? Where did you hide her? Speak out.. Where is she? Where did you hide her? Speak out! Speak up, you dog! Tie him up. He should not escape. Dirty animal. Let him lie there. We will find her from wherever she is in this dessert. Basheer. Basheer. Basheer. Where is he? Basheer. What happened to you? It looks like they beat you up a lot. Did you try to escape again? Don't you know that the desert here is like a sea? It's not easy to escape from here. Even I did this job for around six years. Although I am stronger than you, I couldn't escape from here. Get up. Go and feed the goats. They're hungry. I didn't try to escape. - Then what? Bharathan, please come with me. They must have killed that girl. Which girl? - I'll tell you. Just come with me. Get the truck. Let's go and see. What? - Just come. Where will we look for her in this dessert? They must have found that girl. You don't even know that girl. Forget about her, Basheer. That's enough. Let's go back. Let's drive some more. Oh, God! I have to return before noon. Let her go. Who is she to you? I said, just drive! Stop.. Bharathan, stop the truck! Hey. Hey.. Bharathan.. Hey. Hey. Don't worry, it's me. It was me who saved you yesterday. He is my friend. I was praying to God to protect you from those guys. God saved her. They can be here any minute. You must escape from here before that. Bharathan, will you help her? Can you drop her on the road? Please do it. Does she wants to go to Riyadh? You! - No! Razak, do you remember me? Yes. I came to know about you later. Can you come out for a minute? I lied to you that day. I thought so. Aswathi came to see me that day. 'Indian maid escapes with gold and money.' Did you see the news? I have been extremely worried from the time I read this. If that man blames me for this, I'll be in trouble too. Don't you know this woman? Do you think she's capable of doing this? No matter what I think, she has been accused of stealing. We can't mess with these people. What did I tell you? I told you to come to Mr. Abu's shop. And what did she do? Mr. Abu waited for her till 10 p.m. But she didn't go there. It's been two days. God knows where she had been for these two days. Are you done talking? I was told to drop her here. Now do what you want. I've been in Saudi Arabia since ten years. So drop this attitude. Don't be too smart with me. When you are done with her, you want me to take her responsibility? If you are bored with her, hand over her to someone else. What did you say? - Leave me. I didn't know what else to do at that time. I was thinking only about me. Sometimes, we all get selfish. I had asked her to escape from there to help her. I got the Indonesian girl who escaped with me the job of a housemaid. I wanted to help Aswathi too. Why did you change your mind now? Are you feeling guilty? After meeting you I couldn't get Aswathi out of my mind. She's nobody to you. Still, you want to help her. So how can I be so irresponsible? I was helpless, Razak. I have been working here as a driver with a lot of difficulties. I'm glad that someone like you is here in Saudi Arabia. I want you to find her. Who's that truck driver who brought Aswathi to you? I didn't ask that. Is he the fool who promised to help you? Do you know someone else who can help you? This is just my bad luck. Get down. You'll get a ride from here. Go anywhere you want. I can't help you anymore. Don't waste my time. Get down! Get in. I said, get in. You can leave. Then what? Basheer risked his life so that he can protect you. What will I tell him? That I abandoned you. Now just get in. "It's a lonely journey." "A journey that never ends." "It's a lonely journey." "A journey that never ends." "With an unquenchable agony" "this is a journey with no destination." "This is a journey with no destination." "Whether it is the night or the day.." "Whether it is sunlight or shadow.." "Will this journey ever end?" "Or will the distance increase again?" "Will the distance increase again?" "Will the distance increase again?" "Will the distance increase again?" Hide under the seat. Hide from the police. What if they question us? If they see us, we'll be in jail. Don't you know the law? You can relax now. "The stars disappear from the sky, the shore is distancing itself." "I can see the infinite distance." "The sky is filled with dark clouds." Close the door. "The ways are unknown, the paths ahead are breaking away." "All the doors of hope are closing down." "Will the moonlight" "light up this dark night?" "Will it light up this dark night?" "It's a lonely journey." "A journey that never ends." "It's a lonely journey." "A journey that never ends." Your dress is dirty. Here, change your dress. "With an unquenchable agony" "this is a journey with no destination." - Here, eat this. "This is a journey with no destination." "Whether it is the night or the day.." "Whether it is sunlight or shadow.." "Will this journey ever end?" "Will the distance increase again?" "Will the distance increase again?" "Will the distance increase again?" "It's a lonely journey." "A journey that never ends." "With an unquenchable agony" "this is a journey with no destination." "This is a journey with no destination." "This is a journey with no destination." "This is a journey" "with no destination." Bharathan, you know the law here. If you get caught with an unknown woman.. I know. But there must be some way. Munir, go and give this at home. I didn't see that girl. But Munir said that she's an innocent girl. Even Bharathan is a good guy. He only looks arrogant. You know the law here. Someone found out about her. They took away both of them. 'Adultery! A Malayalee woman and a man sentenced' 'to three months of imprisonment and 300 lashes.' Okay. It's a case of adultery. But this news isn't enough for us. We need an exclusive news. Razak, you were investigating on this matter, right? Let's workout this story from that angle. You should go to the police station and talk to that woman. Also talk to that man, Usman and that sponsor. And create a live sketch. We must put together the problems in her village the torture she had to go through in that Arab's house and her miserable journey in the desert. And publish a superb story in the paper on all the Fridays when she gets lashed. When the article has your name in it most of the Malayalees here will believe it too. News about an amazing and life threatening journey of a Malayalee woman. Razak. - Sitting in this AC room won't help you understand the pain people go through in their lives. I meet people like them every day. Therefore, their pain hurts me too. Try to be a human first. I'm Razak. A social worker of Riyadh. I know how you escaped from that Arab family and how you reached here. The law is very strict here. We have to bear the punishment. You won't be punished for the complaint made against you by the sponsor. The truth will get revealed in the court. I talked to your parents. Don't worry. I didn't tell them that you are here. I lied to them about why you couldn't contact them. I don't know whether they believed me or not. After your punishment is over, you can go back to your native. Be strong. Everything will be fine. I don't know you. Then why are you helping me? You didn't know Aswathi either. But still, you helped her. Maybe God has planned this to introduce us to each other. Do you want me to inform anyone in your village? No. I don't have anyone to wait for me. I don't need your help. Your sponsor cancelled your visa. Now deportation is the only solution. If we don't do anything, the process will get delayed. Do you want to suffer in the jail for that long? Even if you don't have a family, you're going back to your nation. I came here 15 years ago, to escape from the miseries there. But I couldn't escape. I helped that girl because I didn't want to leave her alone. But even she couldn't escape. You used to work in the desert, right? Even on the deserts where no life can grow we can find a few spots where life flourishes. Those little plants defeat the heat of the desert. If those little plants can do that even we, the humans, can face anything. What did you do, Razak? - What happened? You visit the embassy daily. How many times did I tell you to renew the passport? But you always delay. You are always concerned about others. Today is Thursday and tomorrow is Friday. It's a holiday on both the days. But why do I need to renew my passport now? I got a call from your home just now. You were inside. What's the matter? Your mom's gone. She had a heart attack and died. How will you reach your village now? Razak. Salim, you must carry out the rituals for me. Ask the authorities of the mosque to arrange a grave for her next to dad's grave. That was mom's wish. Let's leave now. We'll keep a funeral here. I can do only that much for mom. This is your ticket and out-pass. We have a lot of nightmares in our sleep. We don't remember it when we wake up. Consider your life here like a nightmare and forget about it. You must forget about your sufferings here before you get into the flight. This journey doesn't put an end to everything. Right, Bharathan? Okay. Hello? Yes. Is it? Which hospital? I'll be there soon. We found this body in the desert. It's been here for four months. No, I don't know. I don't recognise this face.
