Hey, it's the leopard man. How're you goin', Larry? Hey, this is my brother, Ben. He's the camera expert. Oh, you're taking over the filmmaking, are you, mate? Ah, that's right. Well, hopefully not. Ben's gonna make a documentary about the trip, the ups and downs, everything. If we can get a show on the Javan leopard on TV, that would really help the cause. Absolutely, mate. We're gonna get everything. - You've got a lot of stuff there. - Yeah, you're carrying it for me, aren't you? Yeah, absolutely. Card one, day one. It's fantastic to be going on this trip. It's great to be helping my little brother. Larry's been working really hard for a long time to get this happening, and now it's all come together. We're going to Indonesia... Oh, what's the line? To prove... Oh, yeah. You're just talking to me, remember? Okay, you're on. So we're going to Indonesia to prove there's a viable breeding population... of Javan leopards in this remote area of West Java. If we can do that, the Indonesia government... is prepared to provide funding to help protect them. Now this land is being cleared at an alarming rate for agriculture, so the pressure is really on to find and document these beautiful creatures... before it's too late. Yeah, that was great. Perfect. Yeah, he might be Mr. Big Cat Expert, but can he pull off a good place to camera? Okay, you're on, mate. This is the remote camera we're taking to Indonesia. I put some bread and jam out last night to see if we could get the local possum to visit. See if we got something. Cut. Yeah. Well, no possum, but we got Frankie. Frankie the terror dog. Loves bread and jam. Hey! Well, this is where we watch for the leopards. You know, get the tranquilizer gun, keep it ready here. If we see one, we might take a few shots with the camera and take out the tranqs, put the leopard down, hopefully get out there and tag it before it wakes up. That's how we have it tied here. It's where we see them from. All right. Cup of tea time. That was good. - Shall we do the cup of tea time line? - No, don't worry about it. As well as my field camera and the remote camera, we're also taking a tranquilizer gun, some tracking gear... and the radio collar for the leopards once we tag 'em. And this is my system of animal management. It's called the Look Analysis Detect System of Fauna Management. We've had these translated into Indonesian for the boys. Translated, fuck! - Okay? - Yeah. - Good to go? - Yes. Give me a sec. Give me a sec. Okay, and you're on. What do you want me to actually say? Well, you know, uh, tell us about yourself. Um, hi. I'm Jane Black, uh, Larry's wife. Sorry. Gonna have to get that. Larry's been working with wild animals now for a long time really... ever since he was a kid growing up on the farm. But now, since he started working with big cats, things have just gone crazy. He gets to work with these amazing animals, and he's traveling all around the world. It's okay. In your own time. I know it's what he loves, and I try to be supportive. I want to be supportive. It's just... He's away so often... and that makes it hard. The markings on a leopard's coat are unique, a bit like our fingerprints, and we can use them to identify individuals. This one is Martine from Tanzania. Beautiful. Wow. This is the first leopard I saw in the wild. Long time ago now. You see an animal like that with nothing between you and it, it's amazing. I knew then and there I wanted to help save these animals. It changed my life. What's that? This is the jungles of West Java, where I was six months ago. It was as close as we got to a leopard. We found the remains of a kill, but there was no paw prints, no solid evidence. And, all right, dial him up, and as soon as you've got him, I'll just come out. - Hey, Budi, it's Larry. - Hey, Larry. - How are you doing? - Good, Larry. How about you? Yeah, good, good. Ben and I are really excited about seeing you guys tomorrow. - Yeah? - Any, uh... Any leopard sightings lately? Maybe. Some cattle have been killed near the jungle up north. Really? Do you think it could be a leopard? - Uh, could be. - Wow, that-that is really exciting. - Oh, excuse me, Larry. - Yeah, sure. No problem. Larry, sorry. I have to go, Larry. No-No worries. I'll see you soon. Okay. All in for card two. Feeling good. All prepared now. I can't wait to get over to Indonesia and get it all happening. We better get going soon or we're gonna miss our plane. Can't carry you. Can't take a sausage dog on the plane. Ohh. Oh! - Babe, love you. - Mmm. Bye, honey. - See ya, Jane. - Bye-bye. - All good, mate? - Yeah. - Here you go. - Yeah, thanks, mate. It's really smoky out there. Beautiful morning. Wow. They launch environmental awareness. Look there. That's coffee in the road. Oh, yeah. That's cool. What a mess. Delayed. So we missed our connecting flight. We were grounded for a couple of hours. Yeah. Hey. Here we are. Keep rolling. Just make sure we ca-catch everything. Whoa, whoa, whoa, watch out. - Thanks, mate. - No good to copy down there. - Hey, Budi. - Hi, Larry. - Good to see you again. - Yeah, you too. - Look at you. You haven't aged a day. - Thank you, yeah. - This is my brother, Ben. - Oh, hi, Ben. - Hey, how are you, Budi? - Yes, thank you. - Yes, and this is Adi, our new tracker. - Hello. New tracker? I thought I was the tracker on this one. Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but Adi has been appointed by government for new tracker. Right. Oh, you speak Bahasa. - Oh, yeah, a little. - And this is Putri. Oh, Putri, nice to meet you. Thank you so much for all your hard work. It's been amazing. So tell me, uh, any... any more news on those cattle attacks? Yes, I just got phone call from the farmer up north in the mountain region. All right, all right, look. Enough of this. Now you're here. We should get going. All right? Okay, let's go. Let's get going. Let's go. Let's get the keys. What's she so worried about, mate? Nothing. She's from the area. She's superstitious. - They believe in Satan Hutan. - What's that? - That's a forest demon. - Forest demon? What, like a... like a werewolf or something? Yeah, something like that. - We almost there? - Yeah, it won't be long now. It's just in the village up ahead. We're gonna spend the night in there. What do you think of this area we're going to, Adi? I think it's dangerous. People and animal, they just disappear there. Think it's the, uh... the forest demon? The Satan Hutan? Many people believe this. The head village, the dukun... They all believe this. The dukun? What's that? The, uh... Like a witch doctor? Yeah, the dukun is the, uh... the special people... who can travel the other world and talk to the spirit. That kind of people. They're special people. Yeah. Yeah, this is my first time in Indonesia. - Really? What do you think? - Yeah, yeah, it's great. Have to work hard. Have eight children to feed. - Eight? - Yeah, a lot of mouths. Yeah. Is it on? Adi's found us a dukun, so we thought we'd check it out. It's a very superstitious part of Indonesia, which is a problem for the leopard program... because if people think the thing killing their animals is a forest demon... or a werewolf or whatever, people just want it dead, even if they end up killing a leopard. This should be interesting. I don't think he's happy with the filming, mate. Turn it off. Turn it off. Okay, uh, I think... I think I've heard enough. - Yeah? - Yeah. So, Adi, what did... what did the dukun say? He said the mountains around here are very dangerous. There's a forest demon who live just up in the mountain. He uses black magic, and when he catch you, chop off your head, take your heart out. He cuts off your head? He keeps you alive by magic and make your head eat your heart. - Wow! - Then he tell you when to die. That's what he said. What'd you make of that, Budi? I'm Muslim. I don't believe in this thing. What about you, Adi? You believe it, don't you? - Uh, not really. - You sure about that? No. Maybe. I'm not sure. What about you? - Me? - Yeah. - No, I don't believe any of it. - Oh, that's okay. So there you go. The tracker the government's given to us, the man who's supposed to be leading us into the jungle, believes there's a forest demon, a sorcerer, up in the mountains. - And he cuts off your head. - Great. Come on. - Hey, Larry. Come on. Let's eat. - Yeah? Oh! Yum! Food! This is card three. We're off to the village today, so hopefully it's gonna be a good day. Don't know who this guy is, but there's a little talking going on. Larry? Larry, tell us what's happening. This man heard we were in town. He came down from the mountains to see us. He said he's seen what looks like a leopard in a cage in the jungle near his village. We need to stop them. We can go to the cattle kill area later. - But if it's poachers, we should go now. - Yeah, okay. Poachers, mate, they're scum. They take the head, the fur, the organs. They take everything. They sell it to the highest bidder. Very beautiful jungle. None of the local people want to live up there. Just make it easier for the poachers. We've been driving for a while now, but apparently it's not too far from here. Larry! Larry! What's with the gun? Gun's just for the leopards, in case anything goes wrong. - Is that cool? - Well, hopefully we won't need it. Not very far, he says. They may be still around, so I think we keep quiet until he approaches. Okay, let's go. - What? - This way. - Look at this. - Look at this. Oh, yeah, it's just... animal... Oh! Wow, man! They'll take anything. - Oh, yeah. - What's this? Looks like a python. Looks pretty young. They can get up to about 20 feet long out here. Oh, this... Look at this cage. It could easily fit a leopard in it. Look at this little guy. He could be still around. There you go, boy. You're free now. - There you go. - Go home. Go home. - You get that, Benny? - Yeah, I'm getting this? Better be careful. They're probably still about. Suvu, just, uh, won't go any further. He doesn't like the area, he thinks it's bad, and he's told us not to stay here anymore. - We should keep going. - Yeah. All right. Fresh blood. - Very fresh. Very fresh. Just now. - Okay. I-I'll go ahead. I'll go first. Looks like it's heading this way. Slow. Slow. - Look at this. - Whoa! - That looks like there's been... - Something happened. - Yeah, some kind of skirmish. - Yeah. This... Lots of blood. There's no, uh... no paw prints though. Larry! - What do you think this could be? - Oh, that's gotta be a leopard. - Big one. - Yeah, they're deep, aren't they? Yeah. - That a trail? - Lots more blood up here. - Look, more blood up there. - Yeah, and the blood goes all the way up. Yeah, could be a big leopard. Ooh, look at that. This is a fresh site. We should stay here tonight instead of going on. All right. This is the hive. It's blending in really well, which is what you want. We bought a chicken off Suvu. Bait... We've got scent baits, but live bait is much more appealing to wild animals. And, um, Budi's got the remote. Gonna stick it on this tree here. It'll pick up anything that we miss. For strong man. Medicine. Okay, so, Adi's found some chaka ayam? - Chaka ayam. - Chaka ayam, which is a... It's a herb the local people sometimes chew for stamina and energy. So I'm gonna give it a go. Yeah, go on. Good for you. Medicine. Oh! Oh! That's disgusting! Give me some water. It's not that bad. My mom used to chew that. That's disgusting! Oh! Why would you do that to me? That's awful! - Adi idea. - That's hideous! It's medicine. Medicine is taste like that. Hey, Ben. Budi, how're you doing? Leopards are a night creature, so to see them, we've got night vision. Ben's camera, the tranquilizer gun, and the binocular all have night vision. So when we turn off our torch, this is what we see. For me that's pitch black. Can't see a thing. Now I can see everything. There's a... There's a chicken... not long for this earth, I reckon. Look up the tree, mate. I thought I heard something. No, I can't see anything. No, nothing out there. Swear I heard something. Nothing. That's the thing that strikes you about being out here at night. Night really is the time when all these animals go about making their business. Yeah. Especially leopards. - What was that? - Something's out there. Something's out there. Look at that! - There's something definitely moving out there. - Yeah. Come on. Come on. Listen. Doesn't sound good. Uh, all right, into card four. Rough night. Not used to sleeping in the jungle in a tent. But, yeah, hopefully we get some good footage today. Hello, chicken. You're still here. Look at that. Hello. Let's go and see what we got. Clips... There's three clips. So we'll see what's going on here. That's probably just the, uh... Yeah, it's just the chicken flapping its wings. Setting off the camera. Nothing. Nothing. - Oh! Did you see that? - Back, back, back. Wow. And we'll go back. Wow. - Stop! - Look at that right there. - That's weird. - That's some... Yeah, it could be a boar, a wild boar, or a deer. - How far is that from the camera? - That's close. Would've come in down here when it was nice and low. All right, okay, there's... there's an old trail here. Something... - I don't see anything. - No, something's definitely been through here... because you can see some broken twigs, kind of... - There's no prints, mate. - Yeah, we've gotta follow this one today. - Today we're gonna have to follow... - There's no prints this way. - I can't see any prints. - What does it matter? I can't see any prints. Do we have a problem here, Budi? Look, Larry, no problem. Adi, look, I can understand if you're a bit scared, okay? It's fine, but if you want to stay, you can stay. Don't come with us. You're just gonna slow us down, all right? I'm not scared, mate. This is interesting jungle. This is my jungle. These are my animals. I love leopard as much as you do, Larry. That's great. I totally respect that. The way I work is, I'm very proactive. I don't sit and wait for the animals to come to me. I go after them. That's what I want to do. Are you gonna come with us, or are you gonna stay here? That's all I want to know. - Fine. Okay. - Okay, Larry. - If that's what you want to do, do it. - Okay. - We're good? - There's no problem. Let's go. Okay. Great, great. We're gonna save the leopards, mate. Good. We'll get our packs. We'll get going. Come on. Don't worry about Larry, mate. - I'm the tracker, Ben. - Yeah, yeah, just... He doesn't mean what he says. Uh, Larry's drawn up a grid, which we'll use to work our way through the jungle, and today we're gonna head north first. Hot in here. Yeah, I'm thinking this way is probably... How is it, Larry? Find any track, man? No, mate. I'm getting my bearings here. - Find it? Any track? - Not yet. Still looking. This way is north, so this is the way we were heading before. This way... Adi, we were heading north before. Let's keep going this way, okay? - Is that north? - Yeah. - We'll keep going north and see what we find. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - I thought it was that way. I think we were going this way. - We all good? - Yeah. Any tracks yet? Larry? Larry! - Adi? - Found any track yet? - We're gonna keep going north, mate. - Fine. - How many times have I got to tell you? - Okay. - All right? - Okay. Fine. We're in the right place. You sure we're not lost? Uh, yeah. I don't get lost. Hey, hey. Smell that? Smell that? Whew. That smells bad. Yeah. Where do you think it's coming from? I think it's coming from around here. Let's have a look. Oh, no. Oh! Oh. Hmm. - Oh! - Here. Ohh! Oh, that smells disgusting. Oh, geez! Well, wonder what that is. Looks like it could be a wild boar... or a monkey or something. Something placed in the road. Shh. There's something... Hey! Hey! Hey, you! Hey, come back! Hey, come back! Hey, come on! Oh, fuck! Ah! What do you reckon? Bit of a poacher? Well, I don't know. I don't see any tracks. No trail. He could be anywhere in there. It's gone. All right. All right. All right. Let's keep going. Just be careful. - Yeah, let's go. - Let's go this way. Keep an eye out. - So you reckon it's poachers? - Yeah. What do we do if we find them? Something's just raced off into the jungle. They're out there. Larry. What's that? That's black magic stuff. Sorcerer's stuff. We should leave this place. What's it for? It's to bring the evil spirit down to this place. Don't... Don't touch it. Come on. Fuck! They're everywhere! Let's hope they know where they are, because I have no idea. That's... Hey, Benny, looks like we've got... We've got a stool here. It's got hair in it. It looks like it's a big cat. Looks pretty fresh. I think it's more likely going that way. Great. Larry's decided that we should split up, so I'm going with Adi. That way we can cover more ground. See anything, Adi? Adi? Adi! No! Nothing! Over here. Coming! Coming! What you got? We've got one. Leopard prints. Right here. - Look how big they are. - Man, that's big. Quite deep. This is fantastic. This is exactly what we've been looking for. This is a fully grown leopard. - It's fantastic. Wow. Did you get all... - Larry! Larry! Over here! Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Down here. Down here. Look how far apart they are. They're really... Obviously, wherever he's going, he's in a rush. See this squashed foliage? Looks like there's been a skirmish or something. - Ooh. - Keep heading this way. Get this... It's a trail. A drag... drag mark. Probably find a tree with a carcass in it. - It'll be nearby. - Is that something? - Hang on. What's this? It's blood. - Yeah. Shit. Shit. Oh, fuck! Dead leopard. Look at that. - Where's the head? - Fuck! Just a waste! Not even a live leopard. Dead one. Nothing left. Just... Look at it. Fuck! Get in there. Have a look at that. That's... Yeah, I've got it, man. I've got it. What? What, Budi? - Larry, this is no good. - What? - We don't think we should stay here. - What do you mean? - Whatever did this has killed fully grown leopard. - Yeah. - It's a serious kill. - Yeah, yeah, it's a serious kill. - Very serious kill. - Absolutely serious, mate. It means... The only two things that can kill leopards... They're poachers and other leopards. This does not look like poachers to me. So that means there's a bigger, more dangerous, more violent leopard out there somewhere. So what we need to do... We need to catch it and tag it. That's our job, mate. We've gotta catch and tag these things so we can save them. That's what you want to do? Yeah? - You can't tag this. - What? You're not gonna tag this, Larry. Why is that, Adi? Because it's a fucking werewolf? Because it's not leopard, Larry. Oh, come on, Adi. This is ridiculous. It's superstitious crap. It's true! It's not superstitious! - It's superstition. You're... That's it! - You don't know nothing! - Your ancestors told you this shit to keep... - Don't blame my ancestors! - Larry, Larry, Larry... - Ancestors... - You're talking like a bad stupid man! - Adi, Adi! It's all bullshit! It's a fucking... You're... Get off of me! Come on! Get off of me! Jesus! Come on! Come on! Come on! You're a fucking coward, mate! It's not a fucking werewolf, all right? - How would you know? - Turn that thing off, Ben. - This is serious, all right? - It is serious! I want to go! You want to stay here, you stay! You said you wanted to come. Mate, stop filming this, all right? Calm down, mate. You stay here! I will. I'm going. Fuck! He doesn't know nothing. Thinks he know everything. Something has just killed a leopard, a Javan leopard. It's an animal that's almost extinct. And, you know, there's a good chance it'll come back here. I reckon it'll probably come back here. It's probably still in the area. It's getting dark, so I think we should stay here tonight. What do you think, Ben? Yeah, yeah, sure. Budi? Budi, we have a deal? Yes, okay. That was no good. I think Adi's got a point. I don't like it here. What is that? Hmm? Oh, it's nothing. Can I have a look? What's it do? Protect you from evil spirits or something? That is my protection from a bad spirit. Can I have it back, please? What's it made out of? Just some stuff. What's that? Could be a leopard. It's getting closer. Where's my torch? Where's my torch? Did you hear that? I think it's this way. Come on. Ben. Quiet. Budi! Budi, Budi, wake up! Wake up, Budi! - What? - Where's Ben? Where's Ben? - I don't know. - There's something out there. - I saw it... - Shh, shh, shh! Look! Look at that! Oh, did you see that? Quick! Quick! Get the gun. Come on. Ben! Where the fuck have you been? I was getting a different angle on the bait. You fucking crazy? These animals are really dangerous at night. Do you want to get killed? - Sorry, sorry. - You take the collar. I'll take the gun. Okay. The bait's gone. It's gone. Hear that? Is it up in the trees? Let's check the remote. Let's have a look at this. What is that? Interference or something, isn't it? Pixilated. what happened? The chicken's gone, but the camera's playing so I can't... What's that? Go back! Go back. That side. - What is that? - The corner. The corner. There. There you go. There. - You see that? - Yeah. What's that? What is it, Adi? Very strange. It's just gotten really quiet. Strange things. See them over there? Hear that? - Yeah. Yeah. - Could be a leopard. - Give me a torch. - Yeah, man. You all set? Go to night vision. Can you see it? No, but it sound like leopard. That's what I thought. A real live leopard, Adi. Give us a look. Come on. What's that sound? Is it another leopard? Maybe. That's leopard? They're fighting! Adi, come on! Give me the gun! Follow me. Stay close. Okay, stay behind. Let's go this way. Shh, shh, shh. We should split up. Ben and Adi, you go that way. Budi, we'll go this way. - You sure about this? - Yes, yes, yes. - Make sure you can see our torches. - All right. Okay. - All right. - Ben, Ben, this way. Here you go. - Ben? - Yeah? - I don't like this. - No, it's okay. It's okay. Where they go? I don't know. There! Yeah, there they are. Just there. Ben, this is bad. Gotta go back. We're gonna get lost if we go this way. No, no. It's okay. You're leaving a trail? Adi, are you leaving a trail? Yeah, yeah, I did, but we still need to go back. No, just a bit further, mate. Come on. Come on. What was that? - Adi! - Ben, Ben, Ben! Are you all right? Are you all right? Calm down! Come on! Let's get out of here! - Oh, shit! - Larry, come on! Calm down, man. What was it? What was it? I don't know. I was holding it. I think I got it. Let's take a look at the card. Take a breath. You okay? - Adi's gotta get out of here. - Are you hurt? Let's just... Give us a look at the tape. Well, go check it out, guys. You just saw the footage. What is it? - It's just an animal. We don't know what it is. - No, I don't think... There's four of us. We've got a gun. We'll be fine. Not a good idea. - Larry, let's go. - Yeah. Okay. - All right. - Yeah. We better go check this out. Okay. Be quiet. Shh! We need to go back. Gonna need to go back now, before we get lost. - Shh. - Come on! - Shh. Be quiet. - You be quiet! I'm going. I'm leaving now, with or without you. - Larry, maybe it's just an animal. - Come on! Adi's right. We don't want to get lost. We should just... Right now. We're going. Come. - Come on. Come on, Larry. - Ben. Let's get back and check the remote camera. See if we've got anything. Come on, mate. We've gotta go. Wait a sec. Wait a sec. All right, here we go. Bushes. Whoa! Whoa! Yeah, look at that! Whoo! See, Budi, we did it! We did it, huh? Adi? Wow. Oh! Bloody hell, Benny. Hey, look at that! Look at that! - It's a real live Javan leopard! - Yeah. Oh, wow, look at that. Ben, come to me. Come to me. So we've been... been very lucky, very lucky tonight. This... This is the evidence we've been looking for. This is... This is the... This is what we want. We did it. We did it, boys. Well done. Eh? Oh! I can't believe it. Right then, for card six. It's a... It's a beautiful morning. It's so good to have Larry back, you know. He's up. He's positive. He's really back on board. It's great. I think today's gonna go well. Sun's just up. Sightings last night were very exciting, so we're gonna stay in the area today and see what we can find. The remote camera has packed it in. It's not, um... It's not taking video, but it's taking photos still. Adi? You all right? No, Ben, I'm not. We shouldn't be going this way. It's bad. He's seen a leopard. He's not gonna turn back now. I'm not going on, unless I can lead. Fuck! Why should I let him lead? It's what he's here for. This way. Should still be in the area. Got anything, Adi? Maybe. Adi! What's going on, mate? - Keep going this way. - You sure? Dead end. - Adi? - Yeah? We should be heading north. I'm telling you, it's back this way, mate. - This way. This way. - This way? - Yeah, this way. - North, in other words. Oh, God! Ju-Just hold on. Hold on. Do you reckon he's trying to get us lost on purpose? Feels like he's just taking us around in circles. Mate, you're the one who told me to let him lead. - Adi! Adi? Come here. - It's getting late. Come on. Let's move. No, come here. This is crazy. Come on, Adi. Come on, Larry. Gotta go. What now? It's getting late. Can we just move? No. Look. We've tried going this way. There's nothing down here, mate. Let's do a little bit more, mate. This is north. This way is north. There's a creek up ahead. It's not far. If we find it, get through it... - A creek is up that way. - Mate, it says here on the map it's due north. Directly that way. We get to the creek... - Sun is that way, then north is that way. - Fuck's sake, Adi! - Adi, we're going. - Come on! Come on! Gonna be a dead end, Larry! Well, we found the creek. The water. What are they? Birds of prey. Wonder what they're circling. Got a fix, I reckon. Let's go. Birds circling suggests a kill. If it's fresh, the predator might still be around. Had a bit of rain, so it's a bit muddy. Watch your step. - Can you see anything? - No. Adi's found something. Oh! Drag marks. Something big and very heavy. Very wide. It's fresh. Look at that. Very fresh. Could be still around, guys. Watch your step. Something in the tree up ahead. Trails. - It's fresh. - Bone. Big bone. Come on, this way. - What's that? - Bone. You see anything else? Larry. What is that? What is that? Can you see that? - It's a hand! - God, that's... that's disgusting! - Where's the head? - It's a hand! It's a fucking hand! Oh! - We've gotta go back. - It's probably a poacher. Doesn't matter who it is! We've gotta go back and report it. - Ben's right. - So listen! Right now, we don't have the time it'll take to go back... - We've got to go back. - But right now there are two leopards, very rare leopards, somewhere out there... - But it's a human hand... - We have to find them. We have to tag them. Somewhere out there is a fucking body! We've gotta go back and report it! No, I'm not saying we don't report it. We report that, but... Well, I'm saying that we've gotta go back and tell the police. - We just stay a little bit longer. - No! We turn back now, Larry! - This is bullshit, okay... - You remember that shit we went through to get this together? How much we had to... How much work we've had to do to get this thing happening? I know what it means to you, okay? But we have to go back. We have to go back. This is serious. Larry, we've gotta go back. Ben's right. There's not going to be anything left of that by the time we get back. - Come on, Larry. - Ben! - Must go. - Ben! Fuck! - I'm going. - Fuck! - Come on, Budi. - Fucking hell! Fucking poacher! Turn the fucking camera off, mate. Fucking... Just calm down, will you? We have to go and we have to report it. - That's all. - Yeah, yeah. - You're going back again. - Yeah, we're that close though.

It's sad, but we have to. It's two days back. Gonna be a long walk, I reckon. Mate, bugger off, would you? Crap day. Such a crap day. I've convinced everyone that we should set up scent baits, so we might get lucky, get something on the way back. Something's out front. What is that? It's moving closer. Listen to that. I think it's moving away. It is definitely moving away. You guys coming? - No, Larry. - All right. Fine. Stay here. Give me the collar. Give me the collar. - I don't want to lose him. Come on.
