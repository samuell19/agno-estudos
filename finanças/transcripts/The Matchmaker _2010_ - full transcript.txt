About an hour ago, 8 missiles fell on Haifa. One of the missiles hit the railway depot building. Haifa, July 2006. 2nd Lebanon War. 8 people were killed and dozens injured. One of the workers, Dani Kadosh, said that there was a warning siren, but there was not enough time to run to the shelter. Father, in my life I have not seen Haifa so deserted. Missile fire, and should we go today? I said that he waited as much as he could, but today is the last day. - Why such an urgency? Said urgently. Today is a must. - He hears badly. - What is hard of hearing? He is hard of hearing. A serious one is probably angry. Are you sure you haven't gotten involved in anything? How could I get involved in something? Two years tied to the house. Trying to write a new book. Where could I get involved? Lord God ... War. Jacob Bride died a week ago. I am in charge of the inheritance. My direction is this: exactly one week after the funeral, I must meet with you. By two. Ignoring the heirs, he bequeathed everything exclusively to you. Inheritance? - To me? - I waited a few days, I thought the war would end. “But you can't wait any longer.” “Just a minute, I have to understand.” Yankele Bride left a legacy to Arik? - My Arik? - Yes. Apartment, bonds ... - How did he earn it? - Cash accounts ... Not by matchmaking. - Do not interrupt. - I can take ... This notebook? I have not seen her ... from the last time ... It was ... 30 ... 38 years ago. He kept it all these years ... - I don’t know if I can take this money. -Well, indeed ... I, in general, was sure that he hated me. These are complexes. To disappear for so many years and now ... Your mother will not believe. Do you remember what she thought about him? Jankele Bride ... We need to go to the grave, put flowers. Thirty probably. When the war ends, let's go together. Tell me - you do not want to go with my mother to me in Tel Aviv? “I don't want to worry.” Drive home. Bye. In the summer of 1968 I was almost 16 years old, and the only thing I wanted was to turn 18 and join the army. To be a soldier, to fight! .. I heard that in Paris, New York, young people of my age go to demonstrations and say that they want to love, not fight. I did not understand what they were talking about. I did not understand why such an interest in love. No more important things? More serious questions? Is there a god? Is there life after death? Why did dinosaurs die out? Why only love, and love, and love? Then I met Jankele Bride ... What, are you sick? Did you see how you passed it to me? “Could you take a simple transfer?” “Did you see how you passed it to me?” - You said you want to be on the defensive ... - You saw how you passed it to me? - Guys, mid game. - I am broken, I am broken. - We’ll rest when we die. “I can replace him.” - Michal, well, that's enough. - Come on the ball and run from here. Say, "Please get out of here." I warn you, toad! - Give me the ball! - No problems. Wow, Michal! Yoram, Yoram ... Leave her, this is a girl, well ... What's the problem? I have no problem. There is a question. Each of you probably has a brother - an older sister who is looking for love? - What? My name is Jacob Bride, a matchmaking specialist. Do you have brothers, sisters? Maybe aunt-widow? Family problems? Also - my specialty. Problems? Family problems. Something the family does not say, what is ashamed, hides. But it happens. Perhaps there are in your families? What's the problem? Are they with tails? What are the tails? What, you want to tell a joke? Okay, here is my business card. Jacob Bride, matchmaker. If someone knows uncle, aunt, or someone is looking for love, contact me. I give a bonus. - What is the bonus? - Award. Something good. Not a bike, but a good one. So, contact, yes? And ... please do not fight. Sorry to bother you, I just saw your bag, and it seemed very beautiful to me. Is this your husband bought? I'm not married. Not scary. Maybe I can help. My name is Jacob Bride. By the way, I’m a matchmaker. Get up, get up, get up ... There is my phone number ... Mister matchmaker ... I thought about what you said, and ... you're right, this is really not good when there are problems. Therefore ... it's a little difficult for me, but ... I have a sister. Older sister. She is 20. Very beautiful, very smart, but ... There is a problem. There is a problem with arms and legs. Hand problem? What is the problem? Yes, it's not really hands, it's ... like fins ... - Fins? - Not really fins, she’s not a fish, but .. She has membranes between her fingers. You heard about it, probably? Like a duck. I know that I look crazy, but ... Nature is sometimes so cruel. “Does sister have fins between fingers?” “It's hard to talk about it, but ... yes.” We live here ... Enter the stairs, first floor, on the right, Burstein. My father was completely desperate. Sometimes he even denies that he has a daughter. He had already lost hope that anyone would take her. This is my job. I’m sure that we will find her someone. - Thanks. - Thank you. Maybe find someone with gills? Shut up, he will hear. Hello my lord. Sorry to interrupt at such a time, I ... came because I heard ... that there is a problem, and I think I can help. What is the problem? The problem with the daughter. My daughter ... fins. The membranes between the fingers. I think I can help my daughter. Daughter with fins? Which fins? No need to be ashamed. My profession is matchmaking. I also fix problems like your daughter’s fins. I can find her someone. What? What? - Who are you? - My name is Jacob Bride. I am a matchmaker. My phone is here. You call and I’ll probably find her a groom. I can help your daughter. - Jacob Bride? - Jacob Bride. What? Jacob Bride? He studied with me in the same class in Karajil Biyashi. I studied at Karajil Biyashi. I ... I am Yogi. - What Yogi? - Joji, Joji Burstein. - Yogi? - Yankele ... - It can’t be. They told me that you got to the camp. Come on, come on, come on in, let's go. - When did you come to Israel? - Come on. - Nili, go see who is here! - Tell me, are you an idiot? “You don't know your father’s friends?” “How can I know?” He is from there. I don’t know anyone from there. Good thing you don't have a sister. She would be offended. Well, the fact is that the idea itself is not bad. - Like The Hunchback of Notre Dame, but you have Carmel Fins. - It's funny. Very funny! Sorry ... K. Tsetnik is the writer who wrote The Doll House, right? About Jewish women and Nazi officers who forced them .... "His name was Ashes" - is that also obscene? - Obscenity? We have no obscenities here. K. Tsetnik is Yehiel Dinur Feiner, wrote 11 books, created a new genre of catastrophe. He wrote about what he saw. - But, if you want a book less provocative ... - No, this one is suitable. I will take. This is ... - interesting. - Yes. A good choice! Although this is not Agnon , I am for it. We will not be snobs. Detective literature is good. It can be perceived as edification. Correctly? She is needed to fight evil. What does philosophy do? She explores cognition and thinking. - Correctly? How useful is a detective? “There are also killings, right?” Right? Yes, the killings. What are you doing? “What are you holding down there?” - Nothing. - Nothing? - What is written on the ad? - "It is forbidden to eat in the library!" Give me what is in your hand. I eat at home, not in the library. He is chewing a sandwich! Insolent! What a cheek! - No thanks. “How long have we been living here?” We are here ... We moved from the kibbutz 16 years ago when Arik was born. How long have you been living in Haifa? For almost 20 years. Who would have thought! Living in a city that Yogi did not even know about. Everything changes, right? Haifa is not so big. Where do you live? Here in the area. Ah, on Carmel? Not on Carmel, but ... in the area. - Water, Yankele? - No thanks. But in Haifa? Yes, in ... That's great. Have you cooked this? - No, she didn’t cook, but bought it. - Arik, come here, we have a guest ... are you hungry? No, I'm not hungry. Son Arik. Jankele Bride, my school friend, like you and Beni, the best friend. That's lovely! A son! Well, what a joy. Son of Yogi. Nice. My father and I studied together at school. My father had a stormy fantasy at school. He thought up various stories well. What about the storytelling? Also good? The inventor ... what else! Dreamer. He reads a lot, but only detective stories. It’s already big, it’s time not to fantasize, but to do the real thing, work. Well, if you like to read detective stories and want to work, maybe you’ll come to work for me, in the Lower City. - To the Lower City? - Where in the Lower City? Lilliputian cinema, in the passage. A family of midgets who escaped from Auschwitz, from hell itself, runs a movie theater ... My office is there, near the movie theater. Well, 5 lira per hour, is that suitable? The lower city is a place for children. I am no longer a child. For the one who lived upstairs on Carmel, the Lower City was ... something unknown. "Civilized" people went down there only to buy goods that sailors brought smuggled. Luxury goods that were then impossible to get in the country, like ... French perfumes or American cigarettes, or real jeans ... I have never heard of a cinema of midgets. Cinema operated by 7 midgets? It seemed to me that this was something from Wonderland. Good morning, Meir. Ah, young Burstein! Well, have you already read Ameta? No. It's a pity. “Glass key,” you know, he wrote, drawing on the experience of his life. He was a detective himself. He kept a diary. It was ... Shame on you! Watch out! - Be ashamed! - Fine, I have to go. - Yes Yes. - Job. Bye. - Look what they did here. Little devils! French perfume received today. Hold on for a week. Smell for a kilometer. Boy, boy, come here. Goods that arrived today from the port, things that are not in stores. I have something for you from the Far East. Look here. See this maid? Dressed. Where is the swimsuit? Dressed. I'll give you two for the price of one, agree? Only for you. Wrap up? - Leave, I ... - Madam, Sylvia, have received a new product, look. - Police! “Sorry, Ms. Sylvia, I'll be back soon.” Tell me, do you know where the matchmaker is here? Jankele Bride. Matchmaker? You are too young to already lose hope of finding yourself. What? - Well ... - Oh, no ... Not for that. I'm just starting to work with him today. Are you the new "spy"? Look, go up here, past the exit from the cinema, there, opposite the Beigel bakery, is Jankele. I am Sylvia. Arik. Thanks. News. Latest news. The artillery battle at Theale. Suez City liquidated! News. Latest news. Madam Sarah, I cannot force a man to marry. The fate is decided by the Creator of the universe, I am only his messenger. But, this is not what I am looking for, it is not love at first sight! Madam Sarah, love at first sight is a divorce from the second, believe me. Swat is like a doctor, you tell him what a problem, he tells you what a medicine. “But he is not handsome.” - What is it - beauty? Who needs beauty? Tomorrow I will arrange everything. Paul Newman is a good guy. Marry you. During a honeymoon, a car crashed into a tree. Damaged face. Now throw it because he is not handsome? No, right? Madam Sarah, from me you get not what you want, but what you need. I want a wedding, indeed. See you. Well, Fins, come in. Well, ready to get started? Your job is awfully simple. You have to check - who comes here in search of love, and who - for fun, yes? Our world is now full of liars. I, as a matchmaker, give my guarantee that I carefully checked the candidate - before the matchmaking. - How to do it? You love detectives, right? Your father said you read detective stories all the time. And now you will be engaged in detective work practically. I want you to check this guy. I feel that something is wrong with him. He always comes to my office in the morning. But the bus returns to the kibbutz only at night. What does he do till night? Does he have anyone here? I want you to check it. So you're waiting at the cinema. As soon as he leaves my office, you follow him, right? “You write down every place he goes.” “Mr. Bride, if you are sitting here, this is bad.” So you are not looking for a groom for me. Why not looking, Sylvia? I’m thinking about it all the time. Ask at least a new spy. For whom, I said, should I look for? - For you. “Madam, Sylvia, every day, Sylvia.” No need to worry. In the end, I will find. Look ... Have you seen this shorty? Similarly in height, it can suck for hours without pain in the knees. Can I have salt? - Yankele, do not ... - You said obscenity about the unfortunate woman who went through the camp hell. Can I have salt? Thanks. I said thank you because it’s polite. When they give me something, I say thank you. When I offend, I say ... - Sorry. - Did you hear? He apologized. Why didn’t you eat what's in the plate? - Do you like Romanian cuisine? - Just ate already. It is important that the plate is empty. If you don’t, I’ll milk. I never leave food in a plate. Never! Listen, good news. I have here, not far, cameras, vacuum cleaners, tape recorders. Come on. Well, what are you looking at? No matter ... Do you think the zoo is here? Throw it to me, huh? I am warning you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Well, how was it? Go sit down, read what you wrote down. I wrote down only ... the address when he arrived and when he left, and ... - after that he went to the bus station. “The address right away is good.” Often you have to wait for the address, keep track of which apartment you entered, with whom you met, right? Who did you meet? How? How is it possible? You will learn, gradually, experience will come. Let me just finish something here. What ... what are you doing with the newspaper? I celebrate customers. Someone died, then there is a widow. There is a widow, there is work. This should be done immediately after the funeral, right? Ok, what time is it? Four. You are welcome. Five, The Fins. Fifteen, twenty ... You can go. Tamara, I ask you to go out. What you do is not good ... I beg you! The neighbors are looking at us. You are welcome! Come out now! There was only one significant difference between Beni’s Iraqi family and my Romanian one: Beni had many uncles, cousins, and Uncle Naji arrived in that summer, who had left for America several years before the war. But, more importantly, I came with my uncle ... his daughter. What you did in that house is a big shame, you can’t do that. Now you have the opportunity to improve. Come on, I ask. All this month I will be in Germany. You will meet uncle and aunts, decent people. I don’t understand why he wants to leave her here if she doesn’t want to. “Because she's ruined?” - Enough, okay? Your sister is not spoiled. She ... - She ... - Problem. - Why problematic? - You don't want to go out? Okay. I will take you from school, you will part with friends, and I will send you to a religious school. Every day you will see only boys in bales. Forget about college. And about free love. Come out now! Is that what you do to me? Do you want to break my life? Will you not let me study? That I was underdeveloped? Do you want to break my life? You tarnished the honor of the family, I will ruin your life, okay? Come on, go! Sorry you have to move to another room because of my father. I will show him! Dumbass! Can I be quiet? My and your dad are asking quietly. Do not roar because of this! Dad, she doesn't want to be quieter! Get it now! Member, I will get! What did you say? Dick ... I'll get it! Tamara, be quiet! And here you dishonor me? She also said the word ... - which begins with the letter ... - What word? letter by word ... what boys have and girls don’t have ... No, this hint is too complicated for him. “They won’t understand what I said,” dick. “ - Shut your mouth! - Naji! Naji! What happened? It is a part of the body. You see? This is my misfortune. What did I tell you? - Emancipated! Burns bras ... - Without them, much more convenient. You go out and everything is shaking. What will people say? What Naji does not have money to buy a daughter a bra? Understand, be obedient, and everything will be in order. Family is a wonderful thing. Go to the sea, go to a concert. What kind of concert? I was curious to get up every morning and keep an eye on Bride's clients. Especially if you suspected that, in addition to matchmaking, they have other goals. Maybe not quite legal ... The eyes of the Lower City. - Hello. - Hello hello. - What is heard? - In order. How are you? I'm fine, thank you. I'm so excited. A woman opened the door for him. I did not consider it well, but it seemed to me that she knew him well. He had been with her for an hour. Everything. With her or her? In her apartment. I don’t know with her or hers. No? But it is important. Because if I make a wrong conclusion from your notes, it can bring misfortune to a person. Remember, Arik: what you have not seen, you do not know. Your notebook has tremendous power. Don’t just write, right? Need to check. Where did you go? Who did you meet? Yes? “But, how will I go?” By what right? “By my permission.” You have an imagination. You are inventive. No, fins? Say you are raising money for those in need. Say you're lost and ask for a glass of water. A dog has bitten and you need a patch, or something like that. - What, should I lie? - This lie is for the good. - Yankele. Madam Clara! I apologize for being late, the film will begin now. Okay, Fins, come tomorrow. I have more work for you, right? Hello my lord. Is this the new "spy"? What's your name? Arik. Burshtein. This is the son of my friend Yogi, whom I told you about. Ah ... right, yes, Yoji. Can you rely on him? For cleaning? Will not tell? I told you, if you want, I'll take it away. - Don’t be afraid ... - No, no, you already do too much. I also need help, not "espionage", cleaning. Yankele had one worker in front of you. Who suits Yankele, suits me. “How much does the miser pay you?” - Hunks? 5 lira per hour, is that bad? Well, what did I say? Miser! I cry 6. What do you say? News! Latest news! Artillery battle with the Jordanians on the Dania Bridge. OK, then I went. Jankele, maybe invite him. It's not pretty ... Fins, come here for a minute. Mrs. Clara says: it is not polite that we go to the cinema and do not invite. And yet, the "spy" ... This is also an Indian film, terribly sweet. All the time my heart hurts and they sing. And do not spend the money that the hunks pay. The hosts are our friends. "Spy"? Mr. Bride and Mrs. Clara, what an honor! Please come in. Even if I’m not happy that Mr. Bride goes to the cinema during the day, instead of looking for a groom for me. Looking, Sylvia, looking. Do not worry, I will find, I'm sure. It's nice to go hand in hand, like in Europe. Speak, speak and speak ... Yonel, I believe, believe in ... love. You will show me great courtesy if you allow me to tell you how I feel. You taught me to laugh ... - Arik, do you want something? - I want what? Something from the kiosk. Is there a drink? Maybe waffles? Do you want Madam Clara, do you want to drink something cold? Ok, go get the tempo you want. Bring me the Sankor from the fridge. But only from below, from the refrigerator, so that it is not warm, right? And to yourself - whatever you want. Don’t worry, you won’t miss anything. They have been singing here for an hour. You will return, they will still sing. I know this movie. The movie is good, right? Yes, good. You will show me great courtesy if you allow me to tell you ... It hurts me to see Jankele. Such a good person! “It's like a proverb:“ A shoemaker without boots. ” - Shoemaker, what? He is a matchmaker, but he has no love. Like a shoemaker ... without boots. - A minute, what? She and he are not together? - Of course not. Impossible. But, you know how he would like? Why is it impossible? Why is it impossible? So go. If you come back tomorrow, you won’t lose too much. - The kiosk on the right. - Thanks. "How are you, mom? Glad to see you, mom. Need help, mom? No, thanks, I'm fine." Hello Mom, nice to see you. Everything is fine? - I went ... - Tell me how it was? - It was nice. Everything is fine. - What? What were you supposed to do? - I can’t rush to the concert now. “Just a second, say something about this Bride.” What is he like? Even his father does not know anything about him, except for what they had in childhood. “He's a little weird, no?” - Yes, a little strange, but everything is in order. Indeed. I will tell you later. “But you are careful, right, Arik?” - Yes Yes. I knew that it was not good to look ... But, I was sure that Beni told her about the periscope. In that case, she knows that someone can see her. And, therefore, does it on purpose. In detective novels there were always beautiful and dangerous women, and they had some kind of plans that involved the hero in trouble. One way or another, I could not help but look at her. Sorry, I knocked ... I didn’t know that you were getting dressed. Sorry I'm interfering, right? - Look, Tamara .. - Can you fasten me? - Of course yes. If you accidentally burned your bras and you need it now, I can give you one of mine, right? Tell me why are you taking care of me? What am I 10 years old? Father deliberately humiliates me. - Why is it humiliating? “The shame I will arrange for him here will shut up all the mouths that faint from his money.” So not good ... This is Beni and Arik, his friend on top. Since Beni was 10 years old, they’ve been in touch all the time. He sees this, and this sees him through the periscope. How is the family. Here, Tamara is ready. Here we are waiting for you, Beni, and your best friend, Arik. Eat first, then ice cream. Look how good it is here. I can not stand this heat! How many songs are left? What are you doing here? He came to save you from death. To not die of boredom. How is it in the country of midgets? The circus? Crazy House? And boob, romanian swindler? Shut up! Did I already say that the heat is unbearable? How much more can you sing? Do you have a heart? Who is she at all, Jona Pamona? This heat is, in fact, unbearable. I say, a movie. Who goes? Madam from the Wild West has already fled. What? How did you run away? Mom will kill me. - Tamara! - Sheer misfortunes! Cousin! I bet your friend is already in love, head over heels. Tamara, I beg, please ... No, where are you going, Tamara? Come back here. What? .. Tamara, what are you doing? No, no, no ... Tamara, Tamara, what are you doing? What...? No, no, please come out! Please, please ... No, no. Tamara, please come out. Tamara, you can’t. Tamara, come out, well ... - Benny, come on in. - You are welcome! “Well, Beni, don’t be soap, come in.” - Yoram ... Yoram, what are you doing? Yoram! “Don't be a coward, come here.” - I ask! - Come on in, the heat is outside. Yoram, what are you doing? Get out both. Oh please. Yoram, we will be kicked out of the concert. Guys, come on, buzz. Beni, come here. Do not be square! Arik, go! What does square mean? Go, go, it's hot outside. Beni, come in! Where are the girls? Come in girls! Beni, Beni, Beni! Do not do this. Beni, come here! - Beni, Beni, Beni ... - Beni! Beni, you are a genius! You are a genius, you are a genius! What an idea! Your friend is persistent. This Tamara ... didn’t leave my mind. Although this is not logical, I felt that I fell in love with her. I also knew that she liked Beni, who was like a brother to me, but they don’t do that with a brother. To stop thinking about it, I decided that I had a chance to do what I had wanted for a long time - to write a detective story. Now that I had to spend a lot of time in the Lower City, which would be full of dubious types, I could do what the waiter at Emil and the Investigators advises Emil: write down everything that happened in the notebook. Spy, are you sure you don't want anything? “No, I don't want anything.” - Even juice? In fact, I have everything: grapefruits and oranges, that's all. I really do not want anything. - What happened? - The worst. My teeth ... You can neither be too hot nor too cold ... I poured a lot of milk ... I worked at the end of the war at a factory of bombs and grenades, dealt with explosives and earned lead poisoning in my mouth. It’s good that the poison remained in the mouth, and did not spread to the whole body. Arik, Arik, cards, please pack in the same color so that there are no problems. - Do you know how to play cards? - Yes. What do you play? Ramie? Poker? War. War, well, then, I know. And, Arik, you're already a big boy ... delicate. Do not tell ... Do not tell what? Well, about the cards. This is not a crime. Many people, like me, cannot sleep at night after ... what was there ... I do not like to talk about the past. Only you will know what is happening here ... Nothing wrong. I came to Israel ... went to bed ... and had dreams ... I screamed. The neighbors ran to screams. I play cards ... not to go to bed. You now have a face like that of my son ... I'm trying to explain to him, but he does not understand. My boy is in a kibbutz ... In a summer camp? No, not in the summer camp, he does not live with me. I don’t have the strength to look after him. I tried, tried ... It's hard. He is crying. And I'm starting to cry. I do not want him to grow up, with a spoiled mom. You understand? And when do you see each other? He comes here ... to visit me. What a fool I am! Why spoil your mood with your stories? Come, Arik, come here. There is a gramophone. Put the record down. I knew about the Holocaust, like all my friends. That is ... not too much. In our family, father spoke little, and mother ... mother did not allow to talk about it. Arik, I heard a joke yesterday, you ’ll fall ... A drunk man enters the elevator, sees a woman there, ugly, and says to her: "Madam, you are ugly." She replies: "My lord, you are drunk." He says: “Yes, but tomorrow it will pass ...” It's funny, isn't it? Really, is this funny? This is ridiculous. I'll go put my face in order. Yankele? What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Today you are cleaning Clara, you were not told to come here. What are you doing here? I thought ... You cannot come here when you want. You will come here when I say! “Now you have seen what is impossible.” - No, I have not seen anything. Do not lie, I saw! Why did you come here today? Now I have a problem. What should I do with you now? - What? “Arik, it’s good that you are here.” I think you ... forgot it from me. I read to know whose it is. Otherwise, I would not know. You write beautifully. About different people. Thoughts are very interesting. Are you not writing about work? What is written in the notebook? This is the secret, mine and the "spy." But, do not worry. I can keep secrets. And you keep secrets, okay? Good? Sorry, sorry Meer. Here, and if you can ... without a fine. Crime without punishment? Maybe you’ll finally read Crime and Punishment? Everything you like is there. And the detective story, and the murder. “At least it's good literature.” - Not now. Not now, not now ... - I told you that I started working. I finish late. - I heard ... - At the matchmaker? - How do you know? Beni told me. He was here, recorded his cousin, who lives abroad. She is here now. - Where is "here? “Up here.” In foreign literature, English. “Well, since Tuiber Swat?” - What? "A man will not marry, unless Toyber has a hand in it." "A simple story." - Agnon. - Agnon ... Agnon writes about Toyber: - "He has a real talent for wooing." “Just a minute, Beni is still here?” I went to buy groceries in the store until it closed. Well, is he as talented as Toiber, your matchmaker, or not? I do not know. I don’t know ... I just thought, I’ve been thinking about this for quite some time. You know, they say: "It’s not completely human being ..." I thought, if you are familiar with him, and if you say that he is talented and ... does not take a lot of money ... I would like ... This is not for your age, Arik. Why not? What, is this a book about the Holocaust? What's wrong? You know very well that guys of your age read "Doll House", just because of the episodes, you yourself know which ones ... Arik? I thought I heard you. I am looking for a book in English, but ... here the stairs are staggering. You can come for a minute, help me, of course. Of course. - What is this book? - It's about Jewish women that the Germans did to them. I heard he said that this is not for you ... What, you are 6 years old? It’s strange. There are ... sex scenes, and he is afraid that it will ruin you? Hold it here. Here people relate to the floor, as if it was ... some kind of dark secret. - Hold it well. - I hold, hold ... - You do not hold, but ... - I hold, hold ... Okay, yes. Okay Tamara? Tamara? Tamara! Dear Vizier! Dear Buyan! Found it. Sorry ... Since when do you read English? No, no, she just asked to hold the ladder, and ... You know, this ladder is the enemy of man. You must understand that, from my point of view, you are a diamond, and a diamond must have a gold frame. Not tin, not copper, but gold. And not necessarily 18 carats, but at least 12 carats, right? And this woman is real gold. Not tin, not copper, but gold, right? OK, then we'll arrange a meeting. Tuesday. And, before that, I will send you to a woman who will teach you how to behave with a lady. She takes not expensive. And come back. I will arrange. Not what you want, but what you need. He returned. I thought, scared to return after what I saw. Or, rather, I didn’t see ... I had a bet with Mrs. Clara - will you return to work or not. Who won the bet? Ms. Clara always wins. She is a wise woman. She says that, in her opinion, you can rely on. Well, then come back tomorrow, and if there is a client, I will send you to check. Wait a minute ... If you are here, it means that the work is really interesting to you. If you want to study, come with me now. I know what you want to say, this is at work. It’s in my head all the time. Who is in my head continuously? Sylvia. Sylvia all the time. Come on. We have come to work. My method is not just to give a business card, you need to recognize the person who is looking for love, right? How to recognize Everyone wants love, but ... Maybe without a wedding, youthful, free love. I do not make free love, I am talking about another love. You should, Fins, look for signs that a guy or girl wants serious love, right? Love, not entertainment. You know, today, if a guy looks at a girl, what does he see? He sees the chest, sees the ass. That is all that he sees. But, before, when he was a child, he did not understand that breasts, buttocks are interesting things. He loved a little girl with pigtails from class. Why did you love? It is in the heart of nature. This is true love that lasts a lifetime. Do you see the guy sitting there on the bench? Let's look for signs. He doesn’t have a wedding ring, does he? This is a good sign. Judging by the clothes, he is a person with a higher education. Also good. Now look, who is he looking at? You see the girl who is in line for ice cream? He looked at his watch: you need to return to work. But while sitting here, licking ice cream. This suggests that not everything is good in his life, looking for something sweet, huh? Signs You can see everything, right? - Like Sherlock Holmes, and he has ... - Now the exam is real, look. The girl pays, will now pass him by. Well, what will he look at? On the face, or chest, or backside? Well, Sherlock, tell me? “I'm talking to ... that.” - For what? - To the bottom. - For ass, say, for ass, do not be afraid. - Ass. - Backside, very good, backside. And I say no. You know? Swat with the soul, represents a person from the best side. Lame, says a good matchmaker, does not run after the girls. Blind, excellent, - does not look to the side. Dumb, very good - there will be no disputes in the house. I also say: he will be shy, he will not look to the left. Well, let's see ... Well, probably I really am Sherlock, and you are his friend, doctor ... no? Watson. What, did you read Sherlock Holmes? What did you think? I have never been a child before ...? Good. I'll go give him a prize - a business card. Do you watch here, right? - Let's say you can find one? - We need to try, but you can. What adorns love is surprises. Everything is extraordinary, every person. Even if at first it seems impossible. But, if at first it seems impossible, then how is it possible then? Say, life brings with a person who is initially bad? No bad, no bad. You can never know. What, are you an agent of an insurance company and give out an insurance policy for love? I will tell you one story. Once, there, we were hiding in the cellar. With us was a woman, a mother with a baby. And the baby was crying. All the time he cried, without ceasing, cried. The Germans ... We heard that they are upstairs. Mother tried to reassure the child. To no avail. Suddenly, at some point, a tall guy stood up, Birion, and closed his mouth to the child. Strangled. The baby is dead. The Germans left, we fled to the forest, and instructed the tall guy, Birion, to guard and protect us. And that mother stood beside him there all the time, so pathetic, looking up at him ... It was as if she expected him to return her child to her. One night, in the forest, she and Birion became close. You say: how can you? He killed her child. But they became close. And after the war they were together. We came here to Israel for many years together. So I ask you: love ... Can you know - good or bad? Hello, madam. You have a very beautiful chain. Is this the husband you bought? I'm not married? Not scary. My name is Jacob Bride. I am a matchmaker. It’s not good for a person to be alone. Keep checking the kibbutznik until you find something else. This is your next job. This girl is religious. Her parents came to my office. They are looking for her groom. Parents are very rich, looking for a groom with a pedigree, right? But, I met a girl and I feel that there is a problem. - What is the problem? “I want you to check it.” You’ll go to her house in the morning, wait until she leaves ... For a minute ... Her address is recorded here in the file cabinet, right? - This is Meir. “Do you know this man?” - Yes, he ... I take books from him in the library. And he is looking for love. I said I would give him your business card. Very good, Fins. Deserved a prize. - You are welcome. Hello. - Hello. Thanks. - I wish you success! - What, are you leaving? - Yes. - Jacob Bride. - Meir. Meir Gutman. - Sit down. Look, Meir, what's outside is not important. What's important is what's inside, right? When I speak with you, I feel that you ... you are like a diamond. A diamond needs a ring of gold. - Not tin, not copper, gold. “I know that I'm not ... a man is not handsome and not ... not tall.” Women do not like low men. Once I had a meeting, a relative arranged. Some came, one and a half heads above me. It was unpleasant. If you take me to find someone, I must be above her. - It's important for me. - I am writing down. - Look for the little one. - I don’t know ... How do they say ... - What do they say? - Well, that's not a problem. I will lead you to a private lesson, maybe even a few. Private lesson? - Mr. Bride ... - Mrs. Clara, Thank you for taking the time. As you say, this is a good deed. And a small income. But really small. Please come in. You are welcome. What's your name? - Meir. - Meir. Well, why are you looking at the floor, Meir? Dropped the money? Oh please. Well, I see the eyes. Finally, a little light in the house. Come in please. You are welcome. I understand that you have no experience. This is not scary. It's hard to talk about it. I see you are worried ... Standing with a briefcase. Embarrassed. Why are you embarrassed? I know you think she doesn’t like women, like you, but ... There is nothing in you that you can be afraid of. The woman does not care about all this nonsense. Nonsense. The woman is important soul. I'll put my briefcase here, no one will touch. It is important for a woman that you will come to her with a goal that you will be excited, shaved and bring flowers. Well, look in the mirror. “Why is it hard for you to look in the mirror?” - I do not like. Well, that is the problem. Do you not love yourself? How will she love you if you don't love yourself, right? Come on, take a look. You see? Look, what a charming man! Look, see the eyes? How much soul, how much strength! You are a strong man! No, don’t be afraid. We will not dance. I just want the music to sound when you think of a woman. Romance. Now close your eyes and start moving your body. I know this may seem a little silly, but it will all go away , rely on me. Come on, Meir, just start to feel the music. Well, not like a palm branch. Come on, try again. More feeling. More than a basin. Let the music enter your soul. Stubborn Esther is here with us. This music is closest to love. Know ... that your love is what awakens her love. You give birth to self-love in her, you save her from loneliness and pain. You will be her hero. Look into my eyes. Feel in the heart? Now you know better how to approach? Can I introduce a woman? Yes, you can try ... The lesson was good. It helped, huh? Yes Yes. Very very. An irrelevant question: do the lessons she gives do not interfere with her husband? No, Clara has no husband. No? Let's leave Clara and talk about you, Meir. Do you know? I have an idea: you said that it’s important for you to be taller than a girl. I think I have someone for you. Someone ... Beautiful. The face is very beautiful. “Really beautiful?” - Greta Garbo. Breast Sophia Loren. Your age, approximately. Beautiful heart. And, most importantly, as you ask, it is small. Very little. “If you want, you can arrange a meeting today.” - Today? Until the lesson is forgotten. - I'm not sure what it is ... - No need to be afraid. If you want, I will join you too, so that you feel calm. “Maybe also Clara will come.” - Clara? That there was confidence, that you felt support. “You and Clara.” - If you want to. Jankele really wanted to find love for everyone ... I already understood that it was not about money, that he was engaged in smuggling goods to earn money. - Hello. - Hello! How are you? - I'm fine. Thanks. - I've been waiting you. More and more, although not at all a hero, I was ready to take risks for him. - Hello. - Hello. - I... I am looking for the daughter of your neighbors, but no one opens me there. I tried to knock, but I do not want to make a fuss. Maybe I can call them from you? But I don’t think they have a phone. - They have installed the day before yesterday. - Indeed? - Yes, brand new, red like that. - Beautiful, have not you seen? Not invited? - Yes, come in. Yes, you can? Can? Thanks. “I'm glad to hear what they installed.” - Yes. - Here is the phone. Sorry to interrupt, I just thought that you would like to hear, Arik, why are you standing? Come on, sit down. The hunks are inviting you to drink, no? So what about the kibbutznik? Did you get in? Very good. Well done, "Fins". So what happened there? He teaches Tanah there, preparing for his perfect age. And the woman ... He has no business with her. Perfection is good. This is very good news. The kibbutznik is getting ready for a perfect life, which means order with the matchmaking. Yes, but, Yankele, why at this age do it secretly. Probably afraid - what they say in the kibbutz. Kibbutz and God - it's like a cat with a dog. What about a religious girl? What is going on there? Meets a non-religious young man. Need to send a woman to check. Maybe you have a girlfriend who knows how to flirt with men? Here it is ... "Fins", you’ll go now, invite Ms. Sylvia here. “I'll be in the office in an hour.” - Meir and Sylvia? - He knows that she ... - She, what? What is the problem? - A small problem with growth ... - What is growth? Sylvia is the heart, this is the soul. What is growth? Is man a growth? Hi, Meir. Where are you going? Did you arrange all this? - I have a job, I ... then. - Meir! - Sit down, Meir, sit down. Look at you! I looked up, I was sure that Gary Cooper had appeared. I told Yankele: "What is Gary Cooper doing in Haifa?" - She said or did not say? - She said. As I saw you, she immediately said. Please enjoy. Yankele told you to come ... My heart beats hard. It seems an intelligent man. Yankele said you are familiar with him. So what do you think? Will there be luck? I don’t know ... I don’t understand this like Jacob. I know, I know. I'm coming. I look like? Beautiful? I didn’t know if it was a good idea for me to come, but ... Yankele persuaded me, therefore ... - He persuaded you? - Yes, what Yankele says, I ... - No need to be afraid. Remember what I told you, huh? - Here she goes. Look how beautiful she is, what a soul! Not Greta Garbo? Who would believe! Gary Cooper and Greta Garbo are here in the Lower City in Haifa. - But, she's small! “You asked the little one ... I found what you asked, Meir.” Take the chance. Maybe small, but she has a big heart and soul. Take the chance, you won’t regret it. Everything will be okay. - Sylvia. - Hello, Sylvia. - Hello. Jankele told me that you work with books. Meir is very, very intelligent. Very smart, very. Ms. Sylvia also loves to read books. And she also has great talent in business affairs. The whole movie theater is hers. Not just mine, the whole family. We bought this cinema for the little money that we had. And films are the best, only love. What could be more important than love, right? Here is my idea: after the religious leaves, send ... to this young man a girl who will try to turn his head around and ... see if he really loves the religious or not. - Not bad idea. - Yes. Then ... I thought ... Thought of what? Tamara? This is not dangerous? What is dangerous? What is dangerous, in the middle of the day, the park, people, I will be there. That is, we are with you. Tamara, can you come and talk to us for a short while? Where is Arik? Yes, let's go. What an honor! I was invited to a men's club. Do not look at them, Michal. If you don’t learn how to cook, who will take you? - What? - Arik has a suggestion. You can say no. “I don't say no.” - No? - No. “You said no.” Great ... What is the suggestion? Close the door. So? News! Latest news! Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia ... - News! Latest news! - Replace me, please. Jankele ... - Sylvia. - Hello. Well, Meir spoke to you? Did you say anything? Because I really liked him. A librarian is a good job. Sylvia dear, I told him you have a golden heart. No need to worry, I'll call him and tell you everything. - My heart is ready, I give it to him. - I'll tell him. - Tell me. I'm hot. Someone bring a drink. Isn’t it difficult for you, Beni? What to buy? It doesn’t matter anything cold. Take it. What? Now what? What do you mean, what now? You wanted me to come, not another, you could ask your girlfriend. I have no girlfriend. Arik, in a week father will be back to pick me up. We will never see each other again. Maybe it’s worth spending some time without Beni, no? - But you and Beni, you ... - What am I and Beni? Arik, tell me you don’t think about me and I will stop. Five seconds Two ... - Well, I get it. “What did you understand?” What you need to wait for when this religious comes out, although it’s already very boring. Here she is, here she is. Come on, come on, well ... Of course, she has a father, a knocked prude, ruining her, like my father. Here she is leaving. Everything. - Now. “Before he leaves.” - Sorry ... - Strange ... - What is strange? I suddenly realized that if she flirted with someone in fact, I would be jealous. Funny no? Well, so what do you say? I, how to say ... Beautiful, no? Greta Garbo! And small, as you requested. Now you're a head and a half taller, no? Are you talking about the one from the movie theater? Oh ... - Well, so about whom? - I'm talking about ... About Clara. “Do you want another lesson from Mrs. Clara?” - No. Not a lesson, I ... I want Clara. No, no, Meir, Mrs. Klara is not for you ... Indeed, Klara is not ... - Klara is not for you. “No, but what does that mean?” Why not for me? Why not for me? I ... I felt something in her ... She said that every woman wants me. “She said that because it is her job.” - What is her job? Cheated? .. Said just like that? What, you ... - You make of her ... as if she ... - as if she what? Meir, don’t interfere where you can’t interfere, right? Ms. Clara is a beautiful woman and unhappy. - She suffered a lot of misfortunes during the war. - What is the connection? That you can’t understand at all ... Why can’t I understand? I understand very well. - If I was not there, I can not understand? - Meir ... A beautiful woman who was in the camp and went ... through hell. It is very clear what the hell ... The fate of the unfortunate horrifies, the heart breaks for her ... And for all these midgets in the cinema. You need to be good to them ... What does it mean to be good to them? What are they cats? - Meir, these are people. - Good. I have to find you a woman. What are the odds? Saying, "I want Clara," is like saying: "I want a young girl, that one." It's impossible! So not Sylvia? Then you can have other girls, right? No, I want Clara. Meir, my task is to give you not what you want, but what you need. Do not overestimate yourself! Well, I suggest you come here tomorrow, and we will see the photos. We are done. Bye. As it was? Your matchmaker, Toiber, he's not ... Well, Fins, come in. Have you seen a religious girl? What kind of story is there with the young man? Good or bad? “She would like to speak with you.” - Yes. Yes, I went and did what Arik told me to do. When we returned, we talked about it and ... came to the conclusion that it was impossible to inform her. Like this, "did you say"? Who cares what you talked about? Now tell me, did he flirt with her or not? - Good ... - Quiet, I'm not talking to you. - I do not know. She doesn’t want to tell. And, besides, probably this is really not our business. I do not pay you for talking, I pay you to do what I tell you. Now answer me quickly: did he flirt with her or not? Ok, we are done. I don’t want you to come here anymore, Arik. “You don't work here anymore.” What time is it? - This is not good. - This is really not good! “Who are you to tell me, good or bad?” What time is it? - What a terrible person! “He's not terrible; you just don't know him.” Why are you protecting him? He fired you! “Well, that's his right.” - His right? What is his right? This matchmaker wants to get money from her parents, don’t you understand? Why didn’t he tell him that nobody was concerned, what they were doing together? “You don’t have the drop of courage that this girl has.” - Stop it. - You do not understand anything! - I do not understand? You are just a miserable coward and snitch! Jankele, we were lucky yesterday. Earned 1000 lire ... Not Jankele ... - Sorry for coming without warning. - Meir. Yes, I just wanted to say thanks for ... help and for ... I would invite you to come in, just ... - I'm waiting, the guests should come ... - No, no, no ... I don't want to bother, just ... - Is everything all right? - Yes. - If there is something that you don’t ... - No, no. - If someone makes you ... - It's all right. You are very cute, and the flowers are really beautiful. - Who's there? “Me, miser.” I nearly had a heart attack. He came, saw everything here. Now, I probably went to the library ... I'm sorry! Who was here? Jankele, close the door so that the neighbors do not hear the noise. - What, teeth again? “Not only ... What, the one who came to bother you?” Well, what did he see the tables? Beverages? So you probably have a party, what does he know? No need to worry. Jankele will settle everything, right? It’s the happiness that I have you. Indeed. Yankele, I know, it’s not easy with me, I'm sorry. Love will come to you ... Love will come. I have patience. One day you will be ready. I'm waiting. How do you endure me, Mr. Bride? “How do you endure me?” - Enough. Enough is enough. Where did I win you? Are you inviting me to dance? - Arik! - Arik! - Arik ... Arik! Arik, Arik ... Your friends made a noise. Tell them not to make noise, father is sleeping. - Arik ... - Arik ... Good morning, vice-matchmaker! “Did the girls tire you?” - Stop screaming, Yoram! We go to the sea, come on, get down. Just a minute - You read? - What, "Doll House"? Started once ... And ... Why delve into this? Are you going to the sea? - Yes, it seems ... - At high seas, you can’t walk all summer. Fooled you! - What, are you normal? - Well scared, huh? Well, sick of it! How long to? Silence testifies that one of you is dead. Just a minute ... Hello. Sorry to interrupt, I walked here by accident and ... I bought a gift for your boy. I thought if he is here, I will give it to him. These are books about great writers. I know, he likes to write, and thought ... Passed by chance here and by chance did you have a gift? Jankele, why don’t you come in? - No, I walked here ... - By chance ... I think your boy was a little offended by me. I was angry, raised my voice a little. No matter. I do not want him to have a feeling of dislike. So I bought something. Happenes. What? It happens sometimes, right? Come, come, come in. Ok, I'll bring water. There is no pie. It is good for weight. What is it? What is it? Louder! Louder! Finally, a normal song in Hebrew. You can even dance to it. A twist or a shake ... - Well? - Here, in the middle of the street? Give it a try. Useful if you go with someone to a disco. Well, who is dancing with me? - Well, Beni ... - Well, well. The most buzz. Look what a life. Two boys who once played snowballs are sitting here, talking and drinking hot tea. Your wife is smarter. She drinks cold. Because it is local, it has not seen snow in life. You have a wonderful family. And the boy is handsome. What is beautiful? This is nature. Sorry I'm asking as a childhood friend ... why? Don't you have anyone? How can it be? This is the whole story ... There is a woman ... Well, not free? The heart is not free. Hello! Is there hot water? Arik ... - Dad, I'm going to the shower. - Come here, we have a guest. But I'm all in the sand, running to the shower. No one has died of a handful of sand. I do not want to walk in the sand. Jankele brought you a present. Hi, Arik. I know that you wrote stories in your notebook. You seem to be talented. So, I thought ... Someday you will become a great writer, and maybe this ... maybe this will help you. Take it. Thanks. The fact that he brought me books was really wonderful. Adults usually do not take childhood dreams seriously. I did not want to follow the religious girl again. And although I didn’t say anything, I think he understood this, and sent me to keep an eye out for a possible bridegroom for Sylvia. Finally! It seemed to me to help Sylvia, and, as Yankele said, is a holy duty. Two tickets, please. - Just a minute ... - Where are you going? The movie is about to begin. Arik ... Arik! “Sylvia, I'm late for Clara, I'm sorry.” “Arik, what about my husband?” Which husband? Lying is for work, not for talking to me. I know that Yankele sent you to watch your husband for me. - I can not talk. “Arik, ” I must know! “Sylvia, I can't.” I can’t. - Forbidden to me. I'm late to Clara. “You are worse than Yankele.” Maybe this is how you settle ... Arik, I ask you, - bring me some good news. - Well, I’ll try ... I’ll try. Arik, I forgot to tell you, my son was yesterday, from a kibbutz ... He took me to a movie on Adar. I love Indian films that are more of the midgets, but he ... well, he loves bang-bang more. Do you like more love movies or ... bang-bang movies? Bang-bang, but ... also ... Well, who is bigger, more girls or bang-bang, tell me. Arik, Arik, go open. Say I'm not at home, go. - Why? - I don’t know, well, boyfriend ... I don’t know what he wants from me. Go, well, well, well! Yes. Is there Mrs. Clara Epstein? She is not at home, I will tell her. Thanks. - Flowers and a note ... - Read. - Not personal? - What is personal? I tell you that I am not familiar with this person. He was here once, Yankele brought him to a courtship lesson, and since then he has been coming all the time, bringing flowers, and saying things that are scary. Well read it. “My love, I'm sorry that I allow myself to use the words“ my love. ” This is the first time I feel this way. - And, forgive me S. Y. Agnon ..." - Again this Agnon! "... for distorting his words, but my heart is full of love, and I am ready to give my soul for love ..." I tell you, he is crazy. All the time, Agnon, and Agnon, and Agnon ... I do not understand what he wants from me. - Sorry, where is Meir? “He was gone today.” Thanks. No, he does not exist. This person simply does not exist anywhere. - What? “I have a friend, a tax inspector.” - What is it? - No, no, this person does not exist. He doesn't report income, you know. And he has income. I have a friend in control who checked. He did not serve in the army. And not demobilized. He is outlawed, our matchmaker. Do you understand? He does everything he wants - plays the life of people. - He does not play the life of people. Is playing! He brought me this midget, insolent ... - He is a criminal! “He's not a criminal.” “He's a criminal, Arik.” Do not protect him. Clara told me. Good? She told me he makes her ... - makes her do different things. - Which things? - Arik! Listen to me, Puppet House - you read it, right? “I didn’t want you to read, but you did.” - What is the connection? Listen to me carefully. Beautiful Germans like these Germans ... these Nazis, damn them! .. What do you think they did to her? I say six million died, right? Those who survived had to do something - to stay alive, right? - No, not true! Not true! My father came out of there, and he did nothing. Either yes or no, you don’t know this ... - He did not do anything. “You don't know that.” - I know! No matter. I just want to say that now it needs to be freed. “We need to save Clara.” - From what? - From the hands of this man! Why do men come to her apartment every night? - Why? For what? “Not for what you think?” - Think ... - I know, I know ... This is a game of cards, just a game of cards. Which cards? Just cards. What, for the money? - A little, not a lot of money. “How do you know all this?” I work there, clean. - Do you work there? - Yes. Are you in share? You are crazy? It's illegal. You are crazy? Do you have any idea what you're stuck in, Arik Burstein? I left Meir stunned, not knowing what to do. Tell Yankele? What exactly to tell? What without intent brought him to serious danger? I thought it might be better not to do anything. Meir is the person who speaks. He is not one of those who act. In the end, nothing will happen. It turns out I did not understand what a lover is capable of for the sake of love. Mr. Arik ... Tell me, do you know where the grocery store is? Aunt Tikva sent me to buy cinnamon. The store, this is far below, you need to go down the stairs ... Is it easy to find? Listen, Tikva, you are just a sorceress. How do you manage to cook like that ... How many people will come for dinner? Besides us, you, Naji and Sami, brother Moshe, Aunt Rachelle and Aunt ... - What is this? Where is Tamara? I went to the store to buy cinnamon. “Three quarters of an hour already.” “Three quarters of an hour?” Maybe she got lost? Will I go look for her? It would be ... a little faster if we went through the mountain. When we were children, we competed in courage - we had to return through the mountain in the dark. - Who won? - What? Do you want to have a courage contest? If you want ... I will win. Whose idea was it to climb mountains? Not mine. Yes, your. No. You know, at first, when I arrived, I thought you were just a moron ... Thank you. It should have sounded like a compliment, but it didn’t work out well ... I'm sorry. Aunt Tikva needs cinnamon. And of course she is worried ... I thought that if Beni found out about us, it would terribly offend him, so without thinking about her, I asked him not to tell anyone ... Okay ... "Okay" is that? “Good” means I have to go. You won’t tell, right? Will you tell me what I can and cannot do? A big hero who in life will not betray his friend ?! You are all hypocrites, just like my father! Very interesting, indeed, it will be interesting when he arrives here. - Just buzz ... - Tamara! Tamara, what are you going to do? Tamara! I'm going to ruin all of you life! I did not understand why she was so angry. Maybe she thought I didn’t love her, what, in general, wanted only this free love, the opponent of which was Jankele? And maybe ... Maybe this insult is generally a pretense, part of a plan of revenge on her father. Go know ... Another problem of that summer is the fear of expectation ... But, a day passed, another passed, nothing happened. My conscience did not torment me, but ... I tried not to think too much about it. - But, he is not attractive. - Who should be attractive? Tomorrow I will settle with Paul Newman. It was a wedding, a honeymoon. The rottweiler attacked him. Will you leave him now because he is not attractive? No, right? I don’t know yet, this is being verified. No need to worry, Sylvia. How to know? For your information, I’m checking ... Everything will be fine. “But I don’t like him at all.” - What does it mean to dislike? This is a man, not ice cream! A diamond like you should shine in a gold frame. Not tin, not copper, gold! And this man, believe me, is golden. You will have a happy life. I feel. - Bye. - Bye. Well, what did you discover? Tell me. Why are you silent? Are you giving me tricks again, like your girlfriend? Tell me! He is not married, that’s true, but ... worse. He paid the woman. I paid the woman money ... This is very good news. Well done, "Fins"! Managing responsibilities. - What are the responsibilities? He paid her. - This suggests that he is free. Take Sylvia, stop paying. This is great - what you saw. It’s not good, of course, to see this at your age, but, well, I saw it. Oh, thank you very much! Many thanks! Oh thank you! Many thanks! - Many thanks! - Well done! Well done, "Fins"! Let's check, please: Everything that is here proves that this person simply does not exist. My name is Jacob Bride, matchmaker. You can call me Yankele. My profession is to find a soul mate to continue life. Contact me. Do not be shy, huh? But I do not have money. If there is no money, no problem. For me this is a good deed. I will contact you after midnight, after I receive information from there that he is probably there. You come in and catch him hot, okay? And remember, she is not involved. She is not involved. It is he, he made her. Good? She's not at all involved. I see you are writing ... If I am not mistaken, I do not pay you for writing stories. I pay you to give out cards to your clientele, right? Well? Do not run after her. This is not a bus, this is a girl. Wait. Take a look. Maybe it will, yes? What do you write? Is the story detective or romantic? I don’t know, I ... I write I don’t know, or the story will turn out at all. Can I ask you something? I don’t know what you write, but make a good ending. People in life have a lot of suffering, a lot of grief. Everyone wants good. Make a good ending, huh? And you? Do not be angry with the question, but ... Have you made a good ending for a religious girl? You ask, did I tell her parents about the loafer guy? Yes. I didn’t tell. Didn’t tell? Although it is possible that the guy will try to care for Tamara? Fins, if there is something that I have learned in my life, it’s not to do anything against love. Why are you smiling? The girl sat down. Well, then go ahead, get to work! But, politely. Not a bus, right? Hello, madam. What a dress ... A beautiful dress. Is this your husband bought you? I'll answer. Hello? Yes Meir, how are you? I'll call him ... Arik! Meir from the library is calling. - What? What does he want? - Talk to you. Yes. When? I, it's a little ... Good. OK, I'll come. Mom, I have to go to Meir to return the book I’ve held up. What, at such a time? The library is now closed. Yes, he said that if I bring him a book home, he will not take action. Good. Dad, can I have a minute? .. I just need to ask you something. It... We were given a job at school about the Holocaust ... Who gave you the job? You have not started your studies yet. Vacation. This is some new initiative of the Ministry of Education, so that we learn more about what was in the camps. The work is written using literature. There is such a book, "Doll House", you know? I do not read such books. And I do not advise you. This is a sick imagination. “Are these not real events?” - Fantasy! As if everyone who survived did something terrible for this. They think that everyone who came from Morocco is a “Moroccan bandit”, and whoever came from Iran is, of course, a miser ... When we arrived here, they were hardly human. So much is left of us, so much! Almost nothing left. And we so wanted to be Israelis, live a new life ... But we didn’t give it! Even if you were in the kibbutz, in the army, in all wars, for them you are a capo or a whore, or someone who is ready to kill for a piece of bread. All these people, like Yankele, living in the Lower Town near the port, do you know why they live there? - Because of work, no? “No, out of fear!” All their life they are afraid that this will come again. Therefore, you need to live near the ships. If trouble comes again, you can escape. And Yankele ... Nobody knows anything about him, right? What does he do, where does he live? Who is he? - Why? Out of fear! - What fear? - Goalie of Haifa “A-Poel” ... - Binish, he is just ... - afraid of death, misfortune. - loses the ball all the time. - Each of his ball ... - Fear. “Aren't you going to Meir?” What were you talking about? About nothing. Nothing about? About nothing. I will bring the police and the tax inspectorate to him, but this can only be done if he is there, if he is caught hot. To do this, you need to make sure, understand? “Only you can.” - Meir, I spoke with my father about what happened ... - Enough about my father. - But you said ... - Arik, really ... You have the opportunity to help yourself and avoid trouble. - Help with what? I do not understand. - At night you go up to the apartment, make sure that he is there, call me at the phone booth: one call and put down the phone. This number. - Why are you getting me involved? “I'm not getting you involved, you're already getting involved.” I help you get out. - Thanks. - Thank you very much, good night. Only quiet, good, good night. Mrs. Clara, where are the 100 tokens? There. Look nearby. It is there. Arik! Scared me ... What are you doing here at such a time? I'm looking for Yankele, urgently. - Are you okay? - Yes. - Look at me. Is everything all right at home? Yes, I need Yankele, now. I ... Call already ... Well, where are you? Fast! Salah ha Din 70! Go, go, go! Fast! Fast! Fast! She is not involved. Only he, only he! Quiet. Take pictures of them with cards and money in your hands. Police! Search warrant! Why are you shooting? Indeed? - Why a search? After all, this is only a domino club ... - What is it? What is this domino? Domino ?! Please come in. What, is something wrong? What a pleasant surprise. Please come in. Maybe eat something? Would you like something to drink? Oh, your name is Meir, right? Come in please. There wasn’t enough a domino player at table number 6. I was pleased and proud of myself. I thought that I successfully got rid of all these troubles with Meir. Now, just settle the misunderstanding with Tamara. What did she mean when she said she was going to break our lives? What a summer! I knew that her father was coming today to pick her up. Hello! Hello! - How are you? - What is heard, Moshe? - Nice to see you. - What is heard? Germany is a bit cold. Go say hello to your father, Tamara. And I wanted to fight in a war. I ordered a ticket, they say to me: "Wait a day or two, there will be an answer." After that they called, they said: "Ended up." Six days? Shorten. Here, Tamara, Tamara ... dressed. Look how good! Can you imagine how much this dress costs in dollars? - You know? - With a new thing, Tamara. “You should try the pickles made by Tikva.” - Where is Arik? Arik are you here? Are you in your room? Are you not coming down because of me? What do you want? What do you want me to do? Nothing. Nothing? Cute. Am I scaring you like that? - Stop it. “Now you tell me to stop.” Is it too late? Late what? - Not ... - It doesn't matter. “I'm sorry to interrupt.” “You didn't interfere.” But, mom wants to start. - There is a problem? - Everything is fine. Right, Arik? All is well. You can go now. Okay, let's go raise our glasses. Children can also have some wine, even Michal, is not scary. Let's drink for life! For the health of Uncle Naji and Tamara, who are leaving tomorrow! We will really, really miss you ... Minute, minute, Moshe, Moshe, before the toast ... I, with your permission, want to thank you, Moshe, Tikva, Beni and you, Michal, for being so warm took Tamara this summer. Thanks to you, Tamara has become even more charming ... - Charming? Me, I also want to say something. - What? I ... want to say something that ... that may surprise you. I want to say ... thank you for accepting me so warmly. “I know that at first I was a little irritable.” - Not at all! We love you, we all love you! Thank you Beni for giving me your room and ... and the whole family! - What a family! For the health of the family! - And the neighbors! What neighbors! - And friends! - And friends! Here are friends who are not in America! In America, where you earn a lot of money, you don’t have friends like here who you can rely on - like in the war that grew up with you. - And they loved. And they loved. Of course, love is the most important thing! - For a life! - For a life! Everything seems to have ended well, right? The end is pretty good, as Jankele requested. I don’t know why Tamara didn’t tell ... Maybe she didn’t have any plan at all, just my imagination ... This is what I learned from Yankele: everything in love is unexpected. It seems that summer has gone quietly, right? But, not really ... Police! Police! - Police! - Police! - Run, run soon ... Search warrant! - Check there in the closet. - There's nothing here. Warehouse is empty. The police and the tax office delved wherever possible. Yankele, a smart man, was ready for this. But, a real disaster, was that since then he has been under their control. They knew what he was doing, where he lived, they knew everything about him. Go know that this will affect him so. How it scared him! A week later, an article appeared about him, on the whole page, more lying than all the lies that have been heard from me in my whole life! Some journalist took a lesson from Clara courtship and made of it something ugly and disgusting. On the street, everyone pointed to Klara and said that she ... is so ... and Yankele is so ... Resentment broke her. She wanted to break off all relations with Yankele. He tried to explain to her that he had no life without her, but ... Nothing helped. She asked him to go far, if possible, to disappear completely ... so that they would never meet again, even on the street, by accident. And he was ready for anything for her, even if it broke him from the inside. And then he just disappeared without telling anyone where. As if he was not there. The whole year I was looking for him, and missed him, and thought that maybe he was angry with me. I did everything I could to find him, but ... I was not a real detective. In fact, I could not find someone who does not want to be found. I have so much left from Yankele, even this habit of looking at funeral announcements every day, despite the fact that I have never met anyone I knew there. Before I saw her name ... What? What is he doing at the grave? Who would have thought that this man suddenly, so accidentally, entered my life? He took me to work because he thought I was an excellent liar. How could I explain to him how dear he is to me that I learned a lot from him? I wanted him to read what I wrote in a notebook so that he knew that for me he is a hero, a real hero. And that I loved him. Like him, I really loved him. I took him to the bus station, but he didn’t want me to see which bus he was taking. He didn’t want me to know where he lives. He said that he reads my notebook and returns. I did not know that ... I would never see him again. Arik, Arik? Arik. Arik ... What, are you still here? Tell me what happened? Nothing ... a little dizzy. - Where are you going? - To the writer, can. Michal called. I told her that you checked out an hour ago. She ... will worry, - Come on, I'll take you. - No, I'm fine. Go to your family say that you have become rich. Jankele Bride ... Goodbye. Bye. This is a story about Yankel Bride ... What a character! Goodbye Father!
