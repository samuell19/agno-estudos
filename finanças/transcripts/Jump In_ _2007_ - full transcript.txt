That's daddy's secret sauce. What's that smell? Dad's famous chili? Extra peppers. Just the way you like it, right, Izzy? Yeah, dad. And for dessert... I tried to make it just like your mama. Yeah, I see you stuck it out for a longer work-out tonight. That's my boy. Remember, boxing is 20% talent... 80% heart. Ugh. And 100% sweat. Showers are legal, Iz. What? Yeah. Chow's up. Izzy's dad had been a good neighborhood boxer back in the day. Actually, he was great. Now he had big hopes for Izzy. So, how was school today, baby girl? I had a fight with my boyfriend. Ah! Boyfriend? Hello, daddy, I'm, like, 8. Heaven help me. Come on, little Earl, keep moving. Ooh. Ah. Watch out. Yeah, that's it. Anticipate the moves. Watch out. Uh! Hi, Izzy. Oh! Ohh! I'm ok. I'm ok. What? I'm nasty. Ooh! Ow! Chuck, help him up. You know what? You two take a breather. So, Izzy... You want the good news or the good news? I'm going to the golden gloves? Almost. I got you one more exhibition match. And if you win that one, you'll be ready. You know it. Who am I up against? The only other undefeated kid in the gym. Rodney. Big Rodney? Wow. Third generation at Daniels to win the golden gloves. You just keep working on your stamina, Izzy. Winning your bouts, keeping your head in it. You can almost guarantee yourself a future in boxing. Slow down, dad. I'm sorry. So, what do you think, Iz? I think I'm going to the golden gloves. All right then. Let's get you in the ring. You're officially in training. That... big Rodney? Here's left. You weren't ready for that one. Oh, watch out. Here's Rodney. Think it was a family reunion. I know that hurt. Come on. Look at the feet work. I taught him that. I taught him that. Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. Hey, stop playing around, Izzy. Stay focused. Let me see the combinations. Come on. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ok. Stay with him. Get him, Izzy. All right. He don't know who he's messing with. Yeah. Here we go. Watch that. Watch that left. Ha ha ha! Ha ha! My boy! Oh! Ooh! Man, you hit me. You left yourself open. Mm-hmm. Never leave yourself open. You're too busy trying to showboat. Hey, ain't nothing wrong with being proud. Yeah, you're right. Next time you're feeling proud, keep your hands up. Ha ha ha. You got it. Hey, Mr. Daniels. I'm ready. I'll be ready for you in a minute, Tammy. You ready for what? Ain't no ballet classes around here. Good, because I can already dance around the ring better than you. Ooh. Why don't you go put a bag over there? What's up, Tammy? Hey, Chuck. Hi. What? I'm just being polite, man. I'm gonna be sick. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Hey, I'll be ready to go in a minute, baby. Slammin' hair. It's not funny. Help me. Can you do it the way mommy used to? You miss her, huh? Yeah. I know. So do I. There's a leak down at the gym. I better get down there. But what about the double dutch competition? Oh. Izzy'll take you? What? Mary will be there. But... Come on, Karen. Let's go! Yo, Izzy, you coming to the movies! Yeah. There's free popcorn and soda. I can't. I gotta-- Take Karen to some double dutch. Ah, it's messed up, man. Man, don't you have to wear like a tutu or ballerina outfit or something? Oh, watch it. Hey, quit it, man. Dad didn't say nothing about taking all of you. Well, that's what he meant. And I hope you have money because everybody's hungry. Come and get it. Yo, Rodney! Rodney, the neighborhood bully. He boxed, too. But he was more of a threat out of the ring. He ruled the neighborhood with fear. I know you're not talking to me, loser. So I hear you're my competition in the exhibition match. It looks that way. Well, you'll never outbox me, daddy's boy. Yes, he will. He's got mad skills. Yeah, that's right. He's been training, so you better watch out. Training? Oh, I'm scared. Yeah, he's the one that should be scared. Right, Rodney? Yeah. He should be scared, right, Rodney? What, punk? Come on. See you in the ring, loser. Yeah, loser. Yeah. That's right. You better run. What? Iz, you sure about the movies, man? Yeah, I'm sorry, man. That's all right, man. Take care of yourself. All right. Look! There's Mary! Mary, Mary! You guys are the bomb. Let's hope the judges think so. Why are you always so negative? I'm just saying the real. Whatever. No, she's right. If the judges don't like us, we're so dead. I can't breathe. Maybe your boyfriend can make you feel better. Izzy Daniels? At a double dutch competition? What happened? Did you lose a bet? My dad made us bring him. Hey, Mary, we heard you guys couldn't find a fourth this year, so you guys retired. Well, I guess you heard wrong, Gina. Oh? Yeah, 'cause Yolanda moved here from Atlanta and she's good. Really good, so you Dutch Dragons better watch out. Mm-hmm. Oh. We are so scared. Not really. Who was that? Gina and the Dutch Dragons. They've been regional champs for 4 years. They are good. So are you guys. I cannot believe they make such a big deal out of jumping rope. It happens to be a huge deal. If we qualify. Negative. Which we won't do if we stand here talking. Ok. I don't even want to be here. Then go. Snack bar's that way. Good luck, you guys. Thanks. Go!

Cool ribbons. Thanks. Thanks, Karen. Hey, good effort. Oh, and, um... Cute outfits. Now, that's a real trophy. But we'll never see one like that. What are you trying to say? Certain people need to step it up. We still qualified for city finals. But we won't get past the finals with that wacky routine you made up. I spent hours on that routine. You need to watch your feet in the ropes instead of worrying about what I'm doing. Mm-hmm. Whatever. The routine is wack. Right, Izzy? Whoa. No, no, no, no, no. This is not my business. Look, my dad's making dinner and we got to go. No, we don't. Yeah, we do. Let's go. Go find Bridget. Look, guys, our routine isn't wack. We just need to find something else. Now, Rodney, don't be embarrassed. Your dad's having a hard time, and people just want to help. Rodney was the toughest guy in the ring and the schoolyard... Thanks.

Yeah. I think so. I know so. Yeah. Now show me that game face. Yeah, yeah. That's it. Who's the greatest? I am! In this corner, weighing 158 pounds, Rodney Tyler! You ok? Yeah. Keep your elbows low and your jabs on him. 20% talent, 80% heart. And in this corner weighing 148 pounds, Izzy "the incredible" Daniels! Touch gloves. That'll be the last time your gloves touch me, chump. Huh! Izzy! I'm right here. Come on! Show him something. Come on, Izzy! Blow us out of the ring! Let's go! Uh! Ohh. That's what I'm talking about. Rodney was 158 pounds of pure mean and full of anger. That anger came through with every punch and shook Izzy. Watch out. Your other left. Incredible? Incredibly lame. Ooh! Uhh! Come on, Izzy! Ha ha! Take deep breaths, deep breaths. Izzy, listen to me! You gotta watch his moves. He swings wild. All right? Wait him out. Just wait him out. He's got power but no skills. If you just stay with him and find your rhythm. Hey, you got this. Ok. You just stay with him and find your rhythm. Come on! Show him something now. Yeah! Winner--Daniels! Yay! Yes! Whoo! Yes! Whoo! That's my boy. That's my boy! Yeah, that was great. Good fight. Good fight, son. That's right! Ha ha! Yeah! Did you see Rodney's face, man? You know, ah, ah, ah, ah! Who turned out the lights? I can't see. Ah, where am I? Man, you think you all big and bad messing with people. You showed him, Izzy, man. He just couldn't keep up. Hey, can't be all that lying on the mat. Yeah, you know me. I'd have shown him a quick one myself. You know all that karate chopping. Wow! Wow! It'd be a side you never seen before. It'd be like little Earl, Mr. High, you know? It'd be like your worst nightmare. Where you hiding those mad skills during practice? Did I tell you you did a very nice job with the way you counted him out? That was wonderful. It's not about knocking someone out, Earl. It's about scoring points with your combinations and your footwork. It's about endurance and what's up here. And that leaves you out. Good job tonight, Izzy. You guys get on home. That leaves you out. I got you. I'm gonna get you. Rodney wondered who left the clothes but after losing that night, he never suspected Izzy. I'm sorry, Mary. Yes. I quit. But we need you. I didn't get in this to play games, Mary. I'm in it to win. Hey. Don't jump. It can't be that bad. Pretty much. You crying? No. Then why is your face all wet? Why do you have so many questions? I'm just asking. Trying to help you out. Well, it's nothing you can help me with. So, um, I heard you beat Rodney. What, you keeping tabs on me? You wish. Yeah, I did. Now I'm going to the golden gloves. Must be nice. Yeah, it's cool. My dad's happy. Mary, come wash the dishes! Coming! What, you ain't gonna say good night? Good night, Izzy. Good night. Oh, Mary, um, since I'm in training, I kind of need my sleep, so if you could do me a favor and try not to snore tonight. Go away. My boy Izzy was knocking Rodney out left and right. Left and right. No, for real, he gonna think twice before he messes with somebody now. It can't be that bad. Maybe not. Sometimes things don't always work out the way you want. What are y'all looking at? Oh, I'm sorry. We just didn't recognize you standing up. Rodney, Rodney, what's wrong? Rodney, what's wrong? Yeah, well, everyone saw a trick. Whatever. It still count, right, Izzy? Yeah, man. Come on, I won. It's over. No. I want my rematch. Whatever, man. Yeah, whatever. 'Cause everyone needs to know you just got lucky? Just let it go. What are you? Chicken? I'm just saying, Tasha isn't that bad. Girlfriend's got like 2 left feet. And not hers. Hey, what about Donzia? Double handed. What about my cousin? Alberna? Yeah! She's almost blind. It's called extreme myopia. Go away, Izzy. Not in the mood. Hey, what'd I do? Nothing. She's just mad. Yolanda quit the team. Oh. Why? Did she finally figure out that double dutch is lame? No. She thinks we are. She joined the Dutch Dragons. She thinks they're the best. Well, they sort of are. Anyway, now we're down a jumper again. And the city finals are coming up. You're kidding, right? Anybody can jump some rope. Hey, shoot. My little sister's free. If it's so easy, you do it. Come on with the come on. Fine. Keisha, Shauna? Let's do this. Come on, Mary, jump in. You show him, girl. Yes. Yeah! Girl, come on. That's it. There you go. Show him, girl! Come on! Yeah! That's it! Yes! There you go. Whoo! That's what I'm talking about. Good job. On your boxer, boy. Bring it on, jump girl. Any day. Oh, hey, hey, hey. I was just kidding. Just kidding. One more time. Come on. He got this. Hope you don't mess up this time. Me either. Whoa. Wow. Oh, my gosh. Enough said. What are you thinking? Don't even go there. Still on a high from your win. I would be if Rodney weren't such a jerk. Boxing doesn't solve those kind of problems. Never forget that, Izzy. Go ask him. Go on. Go. Ok. Hey. What are you guys doing here? Looking for you. You found me. So? You jump pretty fast. Well, I do have some skills. At what? Bragging? We want you to join our team. Your jump rope team? Yeah. Ok. Y'all are seriously tripping. No, we're not. Look, the city finals are coming up in a couple of weeks. And the competition is super tough. And, Izzy, you're a good jumper. And you said it yourself, you've got skills. Ok. Look, I'm sorry for y'all, but I can't go out like that. All right? Jump roping isn't me. Why? It just isn't. You jump rope all the time. Yeah, for boxing, not for whatever it is y'all do. You scared your boys will laugh at you? Come on, Izzy. We really need you. No. Forget him. It's not worth it. Oh, come on, Mary. You know you can't forget me. Already forgotten. Dad's cooking chili again. Ah. I'm on it. Large pie to go. How do you know? The answer's still no. We don't want you to be on the team. Good. 'Cause it wasn't happening. We just want you to fill in until we can find somebody else. Fill in. Yep. Standing as a fourth so we can plan a routine right while we look for someone. So you wouldn't actually be on the team. I don't know. Please. Izzy. Your skills are tight. We really need you. And Mary really wants you. Didn't seem like it. Ohh! Yeah! She's all for it. Completely. Over my dead body. Why not? He can help us! No! You know, guys, I'm out of here. Wait. We need you. Mary. What? We can get my play cousin. Leslie. But Leslie moved to Alaska. So what's a plane ticket? Mary. Later. Come on. All right. Fine. Yes? Stay. Like you mean it. We could really use your help. Please? Since you're begging, I'll do it. Yes! Cool! So we meet for practice tomorrow after school in the park. The park? In front of the whole neighborhood? You guys crazy? Forget that. Here's the deal. I'll do it, but it has to be before school and at the gym. My dad doesn't open up before 8:00 so we can meet at 6:00. That'll work. Thanks, Izzy. You're the best. There's room for one more. Hmm. She's happy on the inside. Way on the inside. Izzy, wake up. Wake up! It's time for practice. If this is jump rope practice, why aren't we jumping? First, we stretch, then we run for stamina. Y'all are tripping. You guys, it's just double dutch. I told y'all. He thinks this is a joke. Just double dutch? This is a sport, just like football or basketball or boxing. A bunch of girls singing and jumping through some ropes ain't a sport. Then let's see you do something. And I don't mean speed jumping. What, you mean like one of those little tricks y'all do? Yeah. Try this. Bring it. What little song you gonna sing? Ring around the roses? We don't sing. We jump. Mm-hmm. Come on, Mary. There you go. There you go. And out. Yeah. What you waiting for? Nothing. Then do it. Take your time. It's not that hard. In. There you go. 1, 2. 1, 2. There you go. Come on, come on. See? It's not that easy. You guys said you just needed someone to fill in. All right? That's what I'm here for. I don't need to learn all that. So you want to practice or not? Not.

I won't be late again. It's not over, daddy's boy. Yeah! Where you gonna run to now, fool? Yeah. I hope you know you can talk to me, but I can't help but notice... Look, what's up, man? Don't hit me. I promise you. I'll give you my lunch money. What? Mr. Tyler! Mr. Hooks. Miss Roberts. Come with me. Detention? And it's free. So you won't be needing Mr. Daniels' lunch money.

Sorry to rain on the double dutch parade, but don't we still need a fourth person for that? Mary's right. We still got to find somebody. I just wish... Never mind. Maybe we could beg Yolanda to come back. I mean, our routine is super tight now. Right. Like that's going to happen. Great. We're the bomb and nobody's going to see it. Excuse me. Maybe I can help. You know someone? Yeah, who is it, Izzy? Me. What? You're obviously not going to find anybody as good as me, so... Oh! We are so going to win now! So, superstar... What changed your mind? I guess I hate to disappoint the ladies. Please. What about your boys? I figure they don't have to know. Great. Then welcome to the team. Yeah. So now that we got a team, maybe we could enter this. The double dutch showcase? It's at the Elgin in Harlem. It's also in 3 days. I don't think we're ready. Hey, we're ready. He's right. We're ready. Ok. Cool. But I do have one condition. What? The name. Come on. Joy jumpers? I can't go out like that. I like our name. We're cool with changing the name. How about the hot chili steppers? I love it. It's all right. I guess. Cool. Ready? Hot Chili Steppers on 3. 1... 2... 3! Hot Chili Steppers! Where you going? None of your... Mm Izzy's leaving. Karen. Where you going? I was just gonna, um... You know, out with Mary.

One more time... Guys ready? I guess so. Give a hand to the Hot Chili Steppers! That's a champ. That's what I'm talking about. Hey, so did you have fun tonight? I mean, it's like your mind was somewhere else. No. It was cool. I had fun, dad. Yeah? I'm glad. Good night, Iz. Good night. Hey, Mary Mary! Are you there? What? I'm sorry about today. I don't care, Izzy. My dad got us tickets to a boxing match. A boxing match? Oh, then my bad. I tried to call. What was that going to do? You asked to be on the team, then you just left us hanging. You had us all fooled, thinking you like double dutch. We looked like fools up there. We were counting on you, but I guess it's all a joke to you, huh? What was I supposed to do? Make a choice. I couldn't. Then I'll do it for you. You're off the team. What? Double dutching is serious to us. To me. And you showed me I can't rely on you. Mary. Jab left. Lucky punch. She's not lucky. She's good. What?! Tammy's a good boxer. Yeah, for a girl. For anybody, man. Now, remember she knocked you out last week. I told you a thousand times. I thought I saw a quarter on the mat. Just 'cause she's a girl doesn't mean she can't box. Just like guys can do other stuff, too. Come on, one more. What's his problem? I think she good, too, man. Let's go, Tammy! That's it. This is stupid. We need Izzy back. No way. We do. We can't compete in the city finals without a fourth. Plus, I kinda miss him. And so do you. No, I don't. Come on, Mary. He's apologized like 8 times. He couldn't say no to his dad. Yeah, it's not like he did it on purpose. And he's helped us. Look, you're the one who's always talking about how we always got to be perfect. Well, we were close with Izzy. Goh. Hi. Oh, there he is! Loser! Yo, Izzy, what's up with this, man? Nice legs, Isadore. What are you trying to say? Ok. All right. You're my friend so I'm going to tell you. What we're honestly trying to say is... You look real pretty. Your mama looks real pretty. Calm down, man. We're just playing. We're just playing. Now I see why you won't give me a rematch. 'Cause you're too busy jumping double dutch. Ha ha ha! I went with the pink.

You were snooping through my trash? My house, my trash. Now what's this about double dutch? Nothing. He's just mad because some kids have been laughing at him because he's on a double dutch team. Hey, I'm 8. I know things. What is she talking about? He's a part of the Hot Chili Steppers. Mary's double dutch team. Right? Shut up, Karen. Shut don't go up. Prices do. So take your advice and shut up, champ. Both of you, quiet. Karen, go to your room. Is this the reason your mind's not been in the ring? Talk to me, Izzy. Why didn't you tell me about this? Because. You wanna elaborate on that? 'Cause you wouldn't have heard me unless I was talking about boxing. That's all you ever talk about, dad. That's all we ever talk about since mom died. You know, I don't even like it anymore. I'm just doing it for you. That's not fair. Just 'cause you don't have a life anymore doesn't mean you need to take mine away. I'm sorry, dad. It's ok. Um...

I'll be right back. ♪ Every night I lie awake ♪ my thoughts come rollin' in ♪ ♪ I see the ghost of long ago ♪ ♪ And shattered broken dreams ♪ ♪ I got to let it go ♪ all the paint is dry ♪ ♪ I got to let it go ♪ and move it in my life Izzy, I've been looking for you. You found me. Look, the girls and I were talking... And I just want to ask you-- I'm not doing it. What? Look... I need to focus on boxing. I don't understand. I'm a boxer. I can't be champion if I'm jumping rope with a bunch of girls. What are you talking about? Is this because of Rodney and them? No. Look, it's not just Rodney, ok? You love double dutch, Izzy. You know you do. And you're good. I'm not doing it. I'm sorry. No, Izzy. I'm sorry. What's up? Double dutch competition's tomorrow, right? So, that's it? You're just gonna punk out because kids are laughing? Look... You normally get on my nerves, but I'm not going to let you go out like that. Imagine if I listened to every stupid comment you and your boys made about me? You think I'd be the best girl boxer in the city? People make fun. I figure... That's their problem. Listen to her, boy. Tammy's got a good head on her shoulders. What's up, daddy's boy? Where you runnin' off to now? To ballet class? So, what, you out of words? Here's one. Move. No! It's time for that rematch, punk. Yeah, so gear up! What? Or are you too chicken? All right. Let's do this. You box at school. All those who can't, teach, right? You do it! Hit him! What's going on? It's a rematch. Rodney and Izzy. You gonna box or dance, jump rope boy? Punch him! Why? Why don't you face the fact that I already beat you? Yeah, beat you bad! Watch it, man. You think that if you beat me now, it's gonna change the fact that your daddy's out of work? Ooh! I'm warning you. Or that everybody here thinks of you as a loud yeah, you tell him, Izzy. I said watch it! Yeah! All right! You can't use fighting to get respect, man. Are you running from me, daddy's boy? Why don't you go home to your jump rope? I need rope to do this... Ooh! Ho ho ho! But with ropes, it's more impressive. You know what else looks better on the ropes? Uhh! Rodney! I mean it! It's over, man. Let's end this. No! Rodney! Stop it! Yeah! Yo, that was smooth. Yeah, that's my best friend right there. I am sorry about your dad. Yeah, I'm sorry I beat you. I'm sorry you're so angry, man, but I'm not doing this with you. You can keep your sorry. Man, we have both got a lot of things to be mad about. But fighting isn't going to make it any better. There's more important things. Uhh! Come on, Izzy! Fight, fight, fight! Fight, fight, fight! Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight! Yeah, finish him, Izzy. Do it. Come on. Go ahead, man. Go, Izzy. No! Look, man, I'm done with you. I'm done with this. I don't know about you, but I am tired of being mad. All right? Yeah, that's my boy. Rodney was probably tired of being mad, too. He just didn't have the words to say it. Truth was, he was impressed. Nobody had ever stood up to him. No one had the nerve to tell him the truth like Izzy. It was a moment he'd never forget. We're here at the double dutch city finals. The top 3 teams with the highest cumulative scores in compulsory, freestyle, and speed will qualify to go to the state championship. And the winner at state could go on to compete at the world championships. This is all very exciting. Is he coming? I said no. But we need him. Well, we got Alverene. Aah! Great. Sorry. Wait. We are so gonna lose. Izzy. Forget Izzy. He's not coming, ok? Yeah, girl. Let it go. No. Izzy. He's here. Izzy? You guys weren't going to try to do it without me now, were you? We thought you quit. I did. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That's all you've got? Uh... 'Cause around here, you need 2 I'm sorrys. And a uniform. All right. Yes. Aw. You guys actually entered? Who'd you scrape at the bottom of the barrel and find? Izzy Daniels? Hey, he's good. Mm-hmm. Right. I'm sure he's good enough for y'all. My grandma would be good enough for them. You'll see. Good luck with that. Oh, and don't worry. I'll let y'all take pictures with our trophy. Please. Your trophy. We will. Mwah. Pssh. I can't stand her. Forget her. Ok, but I still can't stand her. So, Izzy, what changed your mind? Well, you said sometimes you have to listen to your heart. Well, I'm listening to my heart right now and it's saying that we are so going to be all that. Ok? You know it. On 3. 1... 2... 3! Hot Chili Steppers! All right. Right now I'm looking for the Hot Chili Steppers. I'm looking for the Dutch Dragons, I'm looking for the Sunshine Steppers!

You looked good out there. Thanks. I'm sorry. No, Izzy. I am. I want us to be able to talk about anything. You know, after your mom died, I guess I pushed boxing a little more because I thought that you loved it so much. I loved it so much. It was just a way for us to connect. Be there for each other. I love you. And I know you miss your mom, 'cause I do, too. I guess boxing was just a way for me to say all that. Boxing is my dream. Doesn't have to be yours. You know, I always say boxing is 20% talent and 80% heart? Well, it looks like your heart is somewhere else. That's ok. I am so proud of you. And I know your mom would be, too. I just want to be your champ. You are. Thanks, Dad. There he is. Looks like some friends are waiting for you. Oh, man! Man, that was off the hook. Off the chain! You know, it's all right if you guys think it's corny. Let's just say I've been enlightened. I think I'm going to be sick. Hey. Excuse me. I'm done fighting you, man. I know. Then why are you here? The double dutch thing is kinda cool. Thanks. For a daddy's boy. Truce? Yeah. Maybe if you teach me that flip, I can use it in the ring. You got it. All right. Now, all the teams were wonderful. However, only the top 3 can go on to the state finals. And those teams are... In third place... The Kung Fu Flyers! Congratulations. Second place... The Dutch Dragons! ♪ Go that day, Izzy made a choice-- To do what made him happy, to not care about what everyone else thinks, 'cause that's the stuff that holds you back. Izzy taught us something that day. I'm glad he did, because it changed my life.
