Breaking news. Last night there was a terrorist attack against the new governor of Korea in Shanghai. This terrorist organization is known as Darkness. Spies called Ghosts were planted everywhere to carry out a series of organized and premeditated terrorist activities. It was reported that there was a fierce battle last night. All the Ghosts involved in the attack were eliminated. There are no survivors. No survivors. 1933, Capital of Korea A new day has begun. Hope your day is good too! Security Information Collection Division, Office of the Governor Collection number 5. Junji Murayama, Management Supervisor Today is sunny. Today is sunny... "The new governor of the Capital will visit the Shrine for a scheduled visit." Department Chief, Cheon Eun Ho What the hell? Why are you looking? I didn't. I came to deliver the file. Then why are you still here? The Golden Tea House. A ticket. "The new Governor will take office in the Capital." "He will die during his visit to the Shrine." Can I borrow a lighter? You'll need it. -3 days later- I heard he was attacked in Shanghai. You don't have to worry about his security when he arrives in the Capital. This place has been under our control for a long time. You just need to prepare for the inauguration. It's been a long time since you last came to the Capital. It's become a little strange... ...in many ways. Shingu Shrine, Korea - Namsan Left column, about face! Attention! Left column, about face! Attention! Everyone. Enrolled! He's just a guard, but he already thinks he's the boss. Isn't that right? Enrolled! I feel honored that you, Captain Yamagata, have taken the post of the new Governor. I will do everything you say and will continue to maintain good law and order in the area. That's enough. Governor. Have you tried the local cold noodles of Korea? Cold noodles... They say the term "cold noodles" comes from China. But I'm not sure. I always wanted to let you try cold noodles. At first, cold noodles were accompanied by first-class beef, but later... Squad 1 stays here. Squad 2, follow me. Let's go. A bunch of useless people. Guard! Come and help me! I'll help you. Over there! Catch her. Catch her! Na-young. She's over there! Find her! We have orders from above. Let's go. Hurry! Murayama. Dakahara. There was more than one shot. Did he manage to escape? Do we arrest and interrogate them one by one? Not yet. Is that ghost again? Didn't you confidently tell me that you eliminated all the Ghosts? I didn't realize that there were still remnants of the party in the Capital. It's my fault. Negligence in duty... And on top of that, it's my first day in Korea. I will eliminate not only the ghosts, but also those behind them, as soon as possible. In 5 days, I will have to publicly read the Civil Government's statement. Handle this quietly. Leave no stone unturned. -Dracula- The Ghosts... Have you heard of them? Yesterday's attack was very similar to the one in Shanghai. I think we should start looking for possible accomplices within the Guard. Is this your report? It could use an edge. The doctrine of common ascendancy is governed by the Intelligence Service. We cannot simply hand over all reins to the Guard. Those who capture the Ghost will have the edge. I will rejoin the Police Department. You... You never seem tired. But being so persistent could become a disadvantage. One ticket. The Golden Teahouse. But being too persistent could turn into a disadvantage. It's me. I saw the captain of the guard at the cinema. He's the same man from Shanghai, who had been setting traps and ambushes for our organization. Be careful. When the time comes to die, I will die. I am prepared. At least don't die before trying to survive. I think Na-young thought the same. Enough people have died. I don't want to see any more sacrifices. I'm sorry. All the movies for today have already premiered. Interesting. This is really something. It's incredible that in this city... ...there's a cinema managed by a Korean. We were in a hurry, so we packed for you. Shouldn't you tell me where we're going? Here you are. I suppose it was difficult to come so suddenly. You didn't get motion sickness on the way here, did you? Well, I did. Three times. Let's sit down first. But... didn't you hear anything? What are you asking him? It's written all over his face. It's written on all of our faces. Look. Surveillance Office, Intelligence Office, Communications Office. There is no common ground at all. Why are we gathered here? Although others may not know it, you must know it. From the beginning, you had a different origin than ours. Here. Hey! What shithole department do you belong to? Who gave you the order? These guys treat me as if I'm invisible. I'm the secretary of the Director of Intelligence! Keep your voice down. And so what if you're a secretary? You have no authority. You're the one who should keep your voice down. You've become a mud puddle. You should know your place. Hey, why are you here? Didn't you go back home? You said your mother is sick. I was brought back from the road. It took some effort to invite everyone here. Allow me to formally introduce myself to you. I am the captain of Captain Yamagata's Guard, who will be appointed as the governor of Korea. Takahara Kaido. I found some interesting things in the Golden Pavilion Cinema. Dracula. The bloodthirsty Count Dracula. Count Dracula by day and by night... You will find something very interesting at the bottom. Although it looks like a printing error, Although it seems like a printing error, it actually isn't. It's an encrypted text. And the person in charge of decrypting it is you, Cheon Eun Ho, Department Chief. Please decrypt it for us right now. But this is an encrypted text consisting of two different systems. A set of tools is required to... -Dracula- There is an organization committing terrorist activities in Shanghai. There was also a spy named Ghost within the intelligence services. I thought at least the capital was safe. But unfortunately... It's a shame. It has been confirmed that a ghost spy has been planted in the Governor's office of Korea. Therefore... That ghost... ...is one of you. "Last chance. Seoul History Museum, January 10, noon." "During the Inauguration of the Governor of Korea," "All hands, join forces and launch a general attack." "Get rid of the new governor." "Get rid of the new governor." Days 11 and 12 have already passed, and there were also 2 locations. But, "January 10, Seoul History Museum." This notice encoded by Darkness is the lucky ticket. And this information is only known by a few people here. "It's not true, I didn't know anything," all of that is useless now. Given that... ...the opening will not take place on that day at that location. "All hands, unite and launch a general attack." So thankfully, it seems that the members of the Darkness will gather. And they will... ...tomorrow. All of you are suspects. Suspicion will not automatically disappear. Unless you can prove that you are not the Ghost, or give a tip about the identity of the Ghost. I'll give you until noon. Make a decision as soon as possible. At noon, I'll invite you all one by one, and your trial will begin. In the interest of fairness, the questioning will be random. So, when I see you again, I hope to work with you. We'll take you to your rooms. Do you want to die? This is a fuel depot. Smoking is prohibited, understood? Yes. Are you sure you dropped it in the car? Where else could it be if not in the car? Keep searching! Who told you to pack your bags without permission? This is the last of the supplies until next week. Take the items to the warehouse. Is this it? Yes. These idiots put me in the same room as you. Some idiots. Let's open the suitcases first. Fire. I said "fire." What the hell? This is completely useless. Hey, get out. Can't you hear me? I told you to leave. Are you deaf? Take your hands off me if you don't want to die. So you're a crazy bitch. Anyway. Get out. I'll change my clothes and then leave here. I told you I'm going to change my clothes. Do it. You're already famous for changing your clothes anywhere. This bitch is getting on my nerves. Murayama. I heard you wanted to see me. There's nothing new. After hearing that you returned to the capital to take office, I realized you want my position. Get your head out of your ass. You want to capture the Ghost? Don't waste your time with that. Anyway, you're not good enough to do it. I'm the one who will capture the Ghost. And then, you will pay for humiliating me today. "The Golden Pavilion" Listen. Now I'm going back to the capital, and the first thing I'll do when I return will be to fire you. You'll see. What are you doing? Entering like this without calling, secretly. I came to ask you something. What? I don't know anything. You talked about Park Cha-kyung in the hallway. You said something about her past. You said she's different from the rest of us. What does that mean? Actually, I'm not sure either. But what's wrong with you? Everyone already knows. You already know how much money Park Cha-kyung's father has. He's so rich he could send a plane to the former governor. They're also one of the country's top merchant families. You asked how she's different. Isn't that different? We don't have access to the governor's house, but she had the ability to listen to internal information in her house. Why? Who do you think the ghost is? At least we can be sure that the ghost is one of us. Where is the phone? Don't make me angry! Idiots, answer the phone! Go back to your room now. Shut the f*ck up and bring the phone! Yuriko-chan... Why are you doing this? Why bother? I'm leaving. No one's here. I want to ask you something. About that day... Tracking the voices of Park Cha-kyung and Lee Baek-ho. With just one call, you'll all be finished. I want to talk to the Director of Intelligence. I know you're listening, answer the phone! Hello? Who's this? Who are you? I'm Ayame, the Secretary of Intelligence Director. What the hell? I'm the Secretary of Intelligence Director! Who the hell called you there instead of me? Shut up and f*ck off. Yeah, you too f*ck off. I'm hanging up. Hello? That damn b*tch! Enough with the nonsense! Don't touch me. Get out of my way. There are listening devices all over the place. Whatever you say... Everything is being recorded. You said you had something to ask me. Hana-chan. Just wait a little bit. Hana-chan. -Report on phone taps- Do you believe him? Excuse me? About Murayama. Do you believe him? Of course, I believe in him. I have faith in Murayama-senpai. Former police captain Murayama. His father committed suicide without a suicide note. That's how he was separated from his father, while Murayama... Early retirement, transfer, demotion. So... Do you still think you know him? Murayama. Murayama Junji. The Shanghai mission should have been yours, Murayama-senpai. But suddenly it was assigned to Takahara-senpai, and I was even reluctant to follow him. But... Senpai, are you Korean? On that day... Where did the blood on your neck come from? With questions like that, anyone can lie to you. I know that's not really the question you wanted to ask. Are you the ghost? Please say no. Are you... ...the ghost? Baek-ho, please. Stay alive. I really liked you. I know. My mother was the only Korean in my entire lineage. That doesn't change the blood I inherited from the rest of my lineage. "The seventh generation of the Murayama family!" "Born in the capital, he's the most popular person who knows the Korean language and current affairs in Korea!" How much of that is a lie? Answer me, Korean! So what? Just because my mother was Korean, do I look different now? Do you want to challenge me? As long as you have Korean blood in your veins, it's unacceptable. From now on, to me you're just one of the suspects. You'll have to prove that you're not the ghost! Take me back to the capital! Right now! Idiot. You said you wanted to be like me. I put you in this position. I rescued a dog from digging through garbage, and now the dog is trying to bite me. Listen to me, you can suspect me all you want, but when the truth comes out, I will make you all suffer. What are you doing? Stop it. Catch him! This is your last warning. Get out of the car. And this is my last order. Take me to the capital. You can't shoot me. Why not? Because I might be the ghost. Why do you hesitate? Shoot! Don't you dare? Don't you have the guts to do it? Do you have the guts to shoot me? When I killed my mother, I used no weapon. By strangling her it seems I unleashed my latent animal instincts. I did it without reservation. Don't question my determination without any basis. If you try to kill me using my lineage as an excuse, remember that... ...I don't need a knife or a gun to kill you. Let me tell you one thing. I will catch the ghost before the sun sets. What did Murayama tell you? Wake up. Look at me. You are not the suspect. There will be progress today. You just have to hold on until the end, do you understand? Stop it! I understand, so take your hands off me! I don't believe it. You're not stupid, are you? I was looking forward to this. Miss Yuriko. Think about it. Do you really think the Director of Intelligence doesn't know you're here? He suggested it himself. Saying that a woman around him knows too much. Do you understand now? You're just a consumable he can throw away whenever he wants. Let me go, you bastards! Hana-chan! You must be hungry. Just wait a bit. I'll be back soon. Hana-chan! Hey! Stop! Move it. Yes, we're already doing it. Who do we start with? There are generally two possibilities in these situations. Start with the suspect, or start with someone who might have information about the suspect. Starting with the first one would be faster, while starting with the second one would be more cautious. Which do you think I would choose? What's wrong? Who told you to walk through here? Hey! I've never been interested in ghosts or anything like that, but now I think the ghost must be you. Soon you'll see what I mean. I'm going to live. This is getting interesting. Have you been robbed? You deserve it, witch. From now on, you will report to me each of his movements. What's up? I have something to confirm. I can't tell you because it's important, but I have to go there. It's already past noon, I don't have time. I have to go. I have to go. Come back. Don't stop me! Let it pass. Don't stop me... Thank you. Yuriko, are you alone? Actually, you're only here as a front. I didn't want you to come. It's better to be with your mother and take care of her. Besides, you're her only son. You're not responsible for anything. But if you stay silent, I will have reason to hold you accountable. There's no need to be nervous. Tell me what you know and you'll be free. Who is the ghost? We'd better not waste our time. I... Don't know. You don't know... I can't believe it. I just did a divination and found out who the ghost is. And this is very reliable. But... But what? Who is it? It says it's me. But I'm not really the ghost. But it says here that I am. What do you think? I don't think you're the ghost either. Really? Why do you think that? If the organization is in its right mind, it wouldn't choose people like you for these things. Thank you anyway. At least tell them later that it's really not me. I have to go home tomorrow at noon. My baby has no one to cook for him, he's at home waiting for me to come back. Please. Mr. Cheon. Please come in for a moment. Park Cha-kyung! Did you see it? Murayama treating me like trash. Why do you think he did that? And in front of everyone too. Why do you think? It's because he's trying to act like he's not the ghost at all. It's just an act. It can't be. It can't be. I thought the same, it can't be. But when I got back to my room, I realized that Murayama was hiding in my room. Do you know what I found after he left? Park Cha-kyung, enough! He put this in Park Cha-kyung's bag. If Murayama was carrying this, what do you think it means? He's the ghost! He's trying to use this to frame Park Cha-kyung as the ghost. You're right. Murayama also came to my room. Now that I think about it, he must have been trying to set me up. Shit! Shit! Do you see? That's what happened. So take this and report him. That way you'll be on your way to a great and prosperous future. I wanted to report him myself. Then why are you offering me something so valuable? No reason. My heart tells me to do it. Yuriko-chan. What? Now focus on this. Mmm. Informant - Section Chief Cheon Eun Ho If you're asking what this is... Yes... Inform the Captain directly! He'll understand. I just wrote my name there! Don't muddy it up! Well, now... No one's listening. Look, Park Cha-kyung. I am the ghost. And I know that you're also one of the ghosts. I always knew. It's impossible to get out of here on your own. Comrades must unite their strength to achieve it. So I need your confirmation. Park Cha-kyung, tell me. Are you also one of the ghosts? What are you doing? What are you doing? Are you crazy? What does this mean? On January 8th, at 6:00 p.m. at the Golden Pavilion, just when I was patrolling the theater, you managed to elude me. Was your intuition always this horrible? How can intuition beat physical evidence? Don't ask me. Ask yourself. Dakahara! Do you really think I'm the ghost? Well... I think... I'm not the one who should answer this question. Why are you helping me? The more I see you, the more you look like a crazy bitch. You could have reported me. Do you think the world revolves around you? Ridiculous. This is between Murayama and me. I identified Murayama as the ghost. Do you have any comments? If you continue not to answer, that will be a pretty clear response in itself. This ends with Murayama being the ghost. The investigation is over. Good timing. Your mother seems to have arrived at the hospital. Maybe she doesn't know you're trapped here as a hostage. You've answered me already. And... ...that was a very clear answer. Kill her. No! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Please, let my mother live. I'm sorry! Please. Wait. I'm sorry. Now you want to talk? Then I'll ask you one last time. The ghost... Who is it? It's Park Cha-kyung. How did everyone get through this long day? I had a crazy and busy day. But in the end, evidence and witnesses appeared. The interesting thing is that... the two things point to different people. Physical evidence points to Murayama, while the human witness points to Park Cha-kyung. But honestly, we've already talked too much about the evidence. So now I'd like to confirm what the witness has said. As I told you before, supposedly the ghost is Park Cha-kyung. That's you. If you're the ghost as the witness says, look around. Everyone is suffering because of you. Let them go. Answer me, Park Cha-kyung. Are you the ghost? Very well. So. Tell us. What is this boy's crime? This boy, this young boy. This young man who risked his life and did everything he could... ...to protect you, Park Cha-kyung. Now we're waiting for your answer. What can you do to help this boy? What can you offer? Answer me, Park Cha-kyung! You're a coward! You're running away until the end! Do it for this boy who bet everything to protect you! What will you do for him? What can you do for him? Answer me! How pitiful! I realized it's the first meal of the day. Let's all go eat a little. You... Ready to shoot! Don't shoot yet! Now! Murayama. You're the ghost. Everyone already knows. So surrender now and put an end to all of this. Lower your weapon. Does being a ghost make you a good person? Isn't it a crime to let other people die to protect the country? Give me the weapon. Give it to me. I...I have to go home more than anyone else here. If I can't go home, I'm going to kill all of you. Yuriko-san! Don't die! Catch her! I'm sorry. Don't say that. Never say that. Get ready. He's not here. Not here either. Father! I killed him. Why? I don't want to live like this. Are you crazy? Why the hell...? Why did you do this? For the country? Is that it? For the country? What the hell is that? That thing called country. Junji. "The sounds of the river never silence the regrets of fallen heroes." "The heavens have no sympathy when autumn descends upon the grass." Who are you? Who are you? From now on, my mission is to keep you alive. And your job is to get out of here safely and keep your comrades alive. I'll take care of the rest here. Don't think I'm helping you. Everyone does their own job. Who are you? There are only two bullets left. Keep them. Were there two ghosts? Someone like you... This is from when I was tortured in Manchuria. The first time I stripped in front of the Intelligence Director, I told him it was the result of youthful ignorance and he liked it even more. That pervert. But thanks to him, I was able to easily hide my identity. From here on is when I started working as the Director's secretary. From here on was last winter. From here on came the spring. Every time they did this to me, I just thought "I'm dying again", "I died again." Don't pity me. There's nothing wrong with dying. Senpai. People should judge things based on experience, not on gossip. Please. Don't disappoint me again. I'm ashamed to face you. From now on, do what you have to do. But... Don't stand in my way. I didn't know they had sent two Ghosts to the Governor's Palace. I didn't expect it either. If only one of them would be captured, I would feel a little relieved. It's better to think about how to save the other person when they're in danger. Live. It's not yet time for you to die. Let's go. It's time to move. We'll have to cut communications to buy time until dawn. There's a military presence, so there must be an arsenal. I searched inside and out but didn't find anything. The most likely place is the basement. There's a fuel depot in front of the main entrance. I should be able to use it. There's also a small warehouse. There's a car inside that nobody drives, I suppose it was used by the hotel's previous owner. With the weapons and the car, we can return to the capital. The communication cables are there, and here is the electricity. I'll take care of cutting off the communication. This material is easily flammable. If you're going to break it, break it completely. I just realized that I don't even know your name. I'm Park Cha-kyung, born in the capital. No need. It's pointless. Fire! Gather everyone! Fire! The engine room. Bring the fire extinguisher. Hurry! It's the engine room. To the square! Quickly! Are you okay? Can't you even search a small hotel? If we don't capture everyone before dawn, I'll shoot you first for neglecting your duty. Come with me! Upstairs is the hotel, but here... Most buildings should have something like this in the basement. Damn psychopaths. I'll take care of the top. It's dangerous to go back. There must be another way out of here. It's the ocean, so it should be fine. You go first, then lift me up. What's going on? Are you crazy? No. Go. Come. Quickly. You can leave. I'm An Kang-woo, I lived in Hanmyung-dong. Thank you for asking my name. You have to go save the rest of the team. No! Stop! Don't move! Hands in the air! My name is An Kang-woo, a member of the Darkness, and I am the Ghost. And... You will never capture me. Take her to the interrogation room! Yuriko-san. Let's begin. So you have the organizational power for guerrilla warfare in Shanghai, and even put a Ghost in the Governor's Office? But what can you do? We will exist anywhere and anytime. That's what I hate the most about you. I don't know if it's perseverance or obsession. That desire to survive like a worm even in a cesspool of water! Disgusting bastards! Who is the leader of the Darkness? Answer me! "Cut off communications and power, create isolation and generate distraction." You seem to have received a proper education. Good. All good, but... They took Yuriko. At least get Yuriko out of there. Please. Indeed, both of you should be captured by me. Why did you make it so complicated when it was going to end up like this anyway? If you had believed me when I told you that I am the Ghost, it would have been easier. Park Cha-kyung. I am arresting you on behalf of the Police Department. Stand up. But... There's something I've been wanting to tell you. Go to hell. The fuel tank has exploded! Get the fire extinguisher! I should have come faster. I'm sorry. Why did you come back? Do you want to die? Thank you, for making me feel less guilty. Dakahara. Now is not the time for this. One small mistake and the Ghost will escape. Murayama. You've got a lot of nerve for a Korean. Then you should grit your teeth and hold on until the end. You know why? Because you're afraid of losing your position. That's why you're always trying to slander and trample on me. You barely made it this far, but you already know... You already know that you don't have the power to maintain your position or the power to get rid of me. Are you going to shoot me? Do it. Why don't you shoot? Shut up! Murayama. Your father... Your mother killed him, right? Family members killing each other... That's your inferior lineage! Junji-san! You said you don't need a knife or gun to kill me. The tires are all flat! Go get the spare tires! The security chief is dead, the Ghosts killed him. I warned you from the beginning not to waste time. A bunch of idiots. Contact the Capital immediately. Yes, this is Yamada. The two Ghosts together killed the security chief and fled to the capital. From now on it's a race against the clock. Today, I'll take care of eradicating the Ghosts and their entire organization. If we don't do this, we'll have lost everything. I will be in charge here. No, wake up. Open your eyes. These are orders from the Chief of Police of the Governor's Office. Due to the urgency of the situation, I will be in charge of this operation. All of you are now under my command. Understood? Understood? Yeong! Let's go. I'm sorry for the sudden intrusion. It's because someone was injured. Rest before you go. Why are you helping us? Those who sell the country wouldn't be so hurt. Only those who protect it tend to get hurt. As you said, I made it known to them that the ultimate goal is to eradicate the Darkness organization. Just in case, only Koreans have been selected to attend. And if Park Cha-kyung or Yuriko appear, they will be shot immediately. The important thing now is not Park Cha-kyung or Yuriko. We are looking for someone else. What did you do? You should have left me and gone. Idiot. "With such a wealthy family, you should have chosen to live in peace and tranquility." "Why are you doing all of this?" "You don't look like a great revolutionary anyway." "For the people I love." "That's what I wanted to protect." "You should stop here. You've done enough." "I should be telling you that." "You put your life on the line." "What else do you have left to do?" "Stubborn woman." "I'll start by introducing myself." "I am Junji Murayama, a police officer from the Governor's Office." "Let's get to the point. There will be no inauguration ceremony today." "I set a trap for you." "I know that there are 7 members of the Darkness organization here." "You will all be arrested." "But until then," "I will give you a chance." "Please come out now and surrender." "It may not be easy to surrender here." "There is honor and reputation to consider." "In fact," "only 5 people need to surrender." "Because 2 are already here." "This woman was an employee of the auditorium," "and this old man could come and go freely thanks to her." "Furthermore, Darkness provided weapons and bombs to this old man." The objective... To assassinate the new Governor. As you can see, all the weapons that should have been used are in the trunk. In other words, you are now disarmed. There's no point in resisting anymore. I have a mission. To make people understand that this idea... ...that Korea can still be independent, the idea for which you are fighting blindly and then paying with your lives, as well as your love for the country, is in vain. People. For a moment, put aside your ideals, and try to objectively see the reality. Damn Koreans... Where is the country you want to protect? The country has been fallen for over a decade and is holding onto the coffin lid. And do you believe that you can still do something about it? It's time to pay tribute to your dead country. Open your eyes! Live in reality! For our common ancestors! For a united homeland! For a unified future! You are the subjects of the Imperial Kingdom! Show loyalty to the Imperial Kingdom! Surrender, members of the Darkness. Don't move! Now is not the time to fight for your lives. Hold on! Surrender! "Profits and danger!" "When you see profits, you must think of justice." "When the nation is in danger, one must give their life." Dong-woo! Sister. It's the Ghost! On the second floor! Evacuate the people first! Get out of my way! The Darkness is here, you bastards. Come here! Get him! Grab him! Aren't you tired? What the hell did the country do for you, to act like this? Murayama. Lower your weapon. Senpai. Yes. From generation to generation... Anyway, you guys... ...are going to lose. I'm ashamed to have survived. It's not that. If we bury it here... It's so narrow and dark... I am so sorry for my brother. One day we will rise up from the ground. All of us. When we get our country back, Should we stop smoking? Smoking will feel even better then. This morning, the inauguration ceremony for the sixth governor of Korea was successfully held. More than 300 national and foreign guests attended the ceremony, celebrating with the new governor for the future of Korea, sharing joy and hope. Due to extreme terrorist acts of some people, there was a small commotion. Indeed, the grace of the Civil Government is a luxury for all the people of this country. So today, during this inauguration, I promise to build a Unified Imperial Kingdom! Get your car out of the way! Don't you see that the road is blocked behind you? Someone got hurt! Are you crazy? Idiots. These damn Koreans! What's happening? I'll find out. Go check it out and report back. - Over there! - Get him! -Wanted people- -Reward offered- PHANTOM
