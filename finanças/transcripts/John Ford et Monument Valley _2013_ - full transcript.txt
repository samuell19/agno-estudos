Ever since my old childhood I've always been hooked on westerns. I liked the action, the freedom. I never realized as a youngster going to school that someday I'd become a western director. And I love westerns, I like to get out on the desert, on Monument Valley and smell the fresh, clean air. This place makes it seem like it wasn't that long ago. On the maps of Arizona and Utah, this is called Monument Valley. But to me it will always be John Ford country. As a matter of fact, folks call this Ford's Point. When you stand here and look around you, you don't have to ask why John Ford loves to make westerns or why we like to go see them. I've been a student of John Ford for a few years. He doesn't make pictures about good guys or bad guys. He makes stories about people. On a her neck she wore a yellow ribbon She wore in the winter and the merry month of May When I asked her why the yellow ribbon She said it's for my lover who was in the calvary Calvary calvary calvary She said it's for my lover who was in the calvary Calvary calvary calvary calvary She says it's for my lover who was in the calvary No one before or since has been able to get on film the vitality and sheer beauty of the west. When Pappy found Monument Valley, he found a subject equal to his talent. He came here for the first time in 1938, brought me with him, the picture, "Stagecoach." Hold it! - Whoa, steady, ho, ho. Well Monument Valley had always been inhabited by the Navajo Indians and in the early 20's, they were having difficulty to survive economically. They really survived from the wool from their sheep and a man called Harry Goulding came there almost by chance and decided to set up a trading post in the northwest entrance to Monument Valley and he gave employment to a lot of the Navajo and created more employment for them. In 1938, he heard that John Ford and the producer, Walter Wanger were considering to make a film version of "Stagecoach" which is based on a novel called "Stage to Lordsburg." And he thought well that, it'd be wonderful if we could get him to shoot here because most of the films, most of the westerns were shot in Gallop which was to the south of Monument Valley but had all the right ingredients for the high street and the main, it just had the right look and it was inexpensive and it had enough hotels for the unit. So, Monument Valley was unknown, so he went to Hollywood with a friend and with a big album of photos by an Austrian photographer, Josef Muench Room and he somehow tricked his way into Walter Wanger's office in Hollywood and met John Ford and persuaded them to shoot the film in Monument Valley. And when Ford saw these fantastic black and white pictures, he said, "Now that's the place I want to go." From the adventures of these American frontier characters, John Ford has created a truly great motion picture, "Stagecoach." I was 30-years-old then, been around pictures for about 10 years. I'd made dozens of westerns with other directors but except for a bit part here and there, I hadn't worked with Pappy. "Stagecoach" was not only the first film he shot in Monument Valley, it was also the first western he'd made with sound and the first time he'd ever worked with me. Took us about six weeks to make that picture. I was just telling the audience a little about "Stagecoach." First time we worked together it seemed to me right out here was one of your set ups. Are you still trying to impress me with your expertise? No, I was just thinking about how many pictures we had made together since then. How wonderful it is to be back up here again. And it's a living. - Good living. Ford's created off Monument Valley an outdoor studio where there were no passers by, there was just the Navajo who were being used as extras. But there was no distraction, they could go there, they could live there for several weeks and transport and communications were incredibly primitive when he made "Stagecoach." It took almost weeks for supplies to come and so on, they just didn't come in by jet plane as today. It was very cut off. So, I think he did have to think about each of those shots and I think he wanted to integrate nature into each shot so that the human beings are always, I wouldn't say they're dwarfed by nature but they're almost at one with nature, more so than practically any other western director's work. Howard Hawks, I think it was, who said that Ford's long shots were the greatest in the history of the cinema. Monument Valley is so identified with John Ford, it's been said that if anybody else made a picture here, they'd be accused of plagiarism. A shot like this a man on a horse riding against the background of harshness and beauty, that's a John Ford trademark. He doesn't just tell you a story, he writes a poem about it. He doesn't just point the camera, he paints a picture with it. I guess what John Ford has been doing for close to half a century is showing his love for the west by putting in motion the moods of Remington and Russell. Ford was very much influenced by the paintings of Remington and Russel who both came to their maturity at the end of the 19th century. I think a lot of people when they first see the western paintings of Remington and Russell, assumed that they must have been at work in the mid-19th century. But it wasn't so, they were both born in the 1860's and so their work was really toward the end of the 19th century and that makes it all the more vivid because it was not so far away from the west which Ford was actually going to shoot. Jack would always get all the Remington sketches and portraits and I studied them. And I tried to get his action with the pictures. It was exactly Remington's also Charlie Russell. Matter of fact, it was more Charlie Russell than Remington. We just studied his pictures, I studied them rather and tried to copy them. Of course with the calvary stuff, that was mostly Remington. Around her neck she wore a yellow ribbon She wore it in the winter and the merry month of May When I asked her why the yellow ribbon She said it's for my love who is in the calvary Calvary calvary Both those artists, I think were romantics. They had this romantic vision of the settler as some kind of courageous man who was braving the elements, braving the savages out there who were stopping them from really colonizing this wonderful, wonderful wilderness that was confronting them. And of course, that's an incredibly right wing view but at the time it was not perceived at such. It was perceived that the white man was bringing something to the Native American which would improve his lots, rather as the British missionaries went out to Africa to improve the lot of the black man. And what Ford liked about Remington and Russell, I think, as well as not just Remington and Russell, but also slightly earlier painters like Albert Bierstadt, like Schreyvogel, they all illustrated this huge barren landscape which had not been populated and had no, to some extent, no towns and no buildings on it. And that was a fascination at the time. What he liked about Remington and Russell was the use of the horse and rider which is a common factor in both their work or so even the sculptures and I think he tried to copy the image of the sole rider against the landscape, against the horizon and there's one particular shot of Henry Fonda in "My Darling Clementine" where you can find an exact replica almost in, I'm not sure if it's Remington or Russell but certainly one of those pictures that you will illustrate. He didn't just copy the detail of the paintings, he copied the spirit of the paintings, that was the most important thing. And when he came to film "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon," by that time he was successful enough to use color and color was coming in more and more frequently and so he said to Winton Hoch, "Could you try to match the colors of Remington?" And so they did a lot of researches, a lot of technical research and it was really Winton Hoch who I think created that look which people then said reminded them of Remington. On her neck she wore a yellow ribbon She wore it in the winter and the merry month of May When I asked her why the yellow ribbon She said it's for my lover who is in the calvary Calvary calvary calvary calvary She said it's for my lover who is in the calvary Ford was not afraid of using what we would call artificial colors. In the scene in "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" where John Wayne visits his late wife's grave and the sky behind is extraordinarily colored, it's not back projections, it often is in Hollywood, it was the lighting that Winton Hoch achieved. Somebody described Remington as being the heart beat of the western myth and I think that's true and you could say the same about Ford, that he's the heart beat of western myth. Because it was a myth and his whole universe is a myth. Drama moves here, raw, violent, real. You live the robust days of frontier men, their nights of danger, their laughs, their loves, you feel a penetrating chill of savage war crimes, piercing impact of an arrow shot from ambush, of Indians of all nations banded together for one last war on the advancing white men. We must stop this war Pony That Walks. Too late, Nathan, too late. Remington once said that "I'm trying to render the west as I saw it big and full of color and I couldn't paint it any other way." And I think that applies to Ford's use of Monument Valley too. He wanted it to be big, he wanted it to play an integral part in each composition and in each film. "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" is not just wonderful because of the photography but it was wonderful also for this incredible emotion about someone how has given his life to the Army and who has to retire and doesn't want to but accepts it sooner or later he has to go and it chimes with his own loss, the loss of his wife and all that which is in the past, and he's not sure what he's going to. Has he got anything to do after he retires from the Army. You don't have to say it captain, I know all this is because of me. You know never to apologize, it's a sign of weakness. Yes but this was your last patrol and I'm to blame for it. Only the man who commands can be blamed, it rests on me. Mission failure. It's a very moving film and it's balanced the sentimentality by the humor of Victor McClankin which he always brings in this wonderful, rather porky, we say in English, porky humor, a bit crude but it just like the clown, or like the grave diggers in Hamlet, you know, it just stops the film becoming too dark, too sad. Men halt, now we want no unpleasantness, a toast first and the guard house after if you're able. In Remington's paintings, particularly we rarely see cowboys and Indians in actual battle or fighting each other and that's because Remington had a profound sympathy for the Native American. And we mustn't forget that John Ford also did that. He was criticized during the 50's and 60's for having used the Navajo as extras for other tribes. I mean, they play not just Navajo, they play Cherokee, they play Cheyenne, they play Apache and in "Cheyenne Autumn" all the Cheyennes were of course, Navajos but I think he did it without any malice. I don't think he was trying to demean the Navajo tribe by doing that and I think on the contrary he had this great respect for them and perhaps towards the end of his life, when he got into his 60's he felt guilty for having made such a big career out of the Indians and I think that pushed him to make "Cheyenne Autumn" as a kind of coda to his entire western career, a final salute to Monument Valley but also a salute to the nobility of the American Indian. Their grace under pressure, the fact that they did not give into the white men without themselves, they didn't surrender any of their honor and I think he liked that. To set the record straight, Pappy cast the Indians as heroes in the last western he made, "Cheyenne Autumn." He did it he said in an interview because "We've treated them so badly." These are the heroes of this epic story. You know I came here to carry out a task, I can't leave now. Working in this school house won't help. It will show them that I'm on their side. Mm-mm, not unless you can change color. You know what they call whites, and... Means fighter. That's right and that's what they think of us, that's what they think of all of us. And why shouldn't they, how many Cheyennes have you fought, how many have you killed? The less than 300 men, women and children fought a fantastic running battle with an army of more than 10,000 blue coats in a seemingly hopeless exodus to their Yellowstone homeland nearly 1500 miles away. What's interesting, I think, in Ford's westerns is that the baddies are not always the Indians, they're often the white men, particularly the traders and gun runners and then on the other hand the gangs, like the Clanton family in "My Darling Clementine" who prey upon the new settlers when they arrive and take advantage of their rather naive optimism and... Ford used Monument Valley, even though it was geographically incorrect. So for example, in "My Darling Clementine" the real Tombstone was about 600 kilometers to the south of Monument Valley but you don't mind because I think that Ford was wanting to be faithful, not so much to the precise geographical locations of the old west but to the spirit of the old west. I think part of the spirit of the old west for him was this idea of man being dwarfed by nature. This concept of the far west as being a paradise, a place where the manifest destiny offered to American settlers could come true, everything was unspoiled, everything was larger than life. And so he managed to create this symbiosis between man and his environment in Monument Valley more successfully than anywhere else. What he did, Ford for Monument Valley for me was that he put there the symbols of civilization or white civilization, he planted a church in the middle of Monument Valley, he planted a graveyard in the middle of Monument Valley, he planted a homestead, a school, these were things which were symbols of family life and family life was very important to Ford. And so I think that artificially he did this and it reaches an extreme point in "The Searchers" when the homestead of the Swedish settlers is really in the middle of nowhere. And you can see it's been built for the film and it's one of the few jarring notes in "The Searchers" where you think well that's just not, it wouldn't be there, it wouldn't be like that you know, exposed to all the elements, they would have chosen a more sheltered place but he does it because he wants that to be a symbol of the family and the farm and raising cattle, raising sheep, raising children, the sense of life going on. From the thrilling pages of life rides a man you must fear and respect, a man who's uncontrollable will and boneless determination carved a rusty rough and boisterous slice of history called "The Searchers." It's John Wayne as Ethan Edwards who had a rare kind of courage, the courage that simply keeps on and on far beyond all reasonable endurance, never thinking of himself as martyred, never thinking of himself as brave. So we'll find him in the end I promise you, we'll find him. When I met John Wayne, I never met him. The only time ever I was near John Wayne, this is why I always think like, forget you know, now he should have known. It was in the commissary, you know what the commissary is, at Warner Brothers. I had long hair and I was wearing a leather vest and jeans and I was editing a rock documentary for... yes. He was in Paris, I was editing this at Warner Brothers, I had just came out to California and there I was in the commissary, there'd be all these actors, you'd say there's so and so and I was kinda new. I was trying to get "Mean Streets" made but I couldn't get it made. And so a year later I finally got it made with Roger Corman. In the meantime I was editing. So, I would sit in the commissary and one day I sat right behind me, right next to me was John Wayne. So I just sat down right here and there were two people eating with me and John Wayne did this, he looked back at me like so, he got up and moved his chair away from me. Because he didn't wanna be sitting too close to me, I had long hair, dirty hippie, which I was not a hippie, I don't know, you know, just a long, everybody had long hair at the time. And I said, "Oh I see, all right." "We still love you," I said, my mind, I said in my heart, I said, "I still love you, you'll never know, you'll never know, it's okay, it's okay." Keep moving, keep moving. Looks like you got yourself surrounded. Yeah, and I figure on getting myself unsurrounded. Let's go! I remember the night my friends and I who are young Italian-American boys, we saw the film we were 13-years-old in VistaVision, which is a big difference. The part of the, the track part of the art of the film, even more so was the use of VistaVision in Monument Valley was an extraordinarily, if you ever saw that projected, it was overwhelming, the visual clarity and the beauty of it. And so the landscape was a major character is what I'm saying. And we then saw the film as we got to be 15, 16-years-old, 17-years-old, it was always on television in black and white and we always watched it and watched it. And one night in the bar we're drinking and my friend says, "You know in "The Searchers," I said, "Yeah," he says, "There's a scene where he's watching his brother, his sister-in-law take his coat and fold the coat." "But you know, I think that he was in love with her." I said, "You know I think you're right." And this is not a film critic, we were the young kids. He said, "Boy that's interesting," 'cause we knew John Ford's name by then. Boy that was really nice the way John Ford just put that in there, you know, we felt about that sub, the whole basic basis is based on that, on that one shot, a medium shot of her. It's not even a close up. Some of the more extraordinary, deeper scenes are all done in medium shot and white shot. So that when Ward Bond takes that cup of coffee and he's in the foreground staring straight ahead and John Wayne comes out and goes to say goodbye to Martha, there's a slight hesitation, he winds up kissing her on the forehead when he leaves. Ward Bond has never seen a think. He's looking straight ahead drinking that coffee. Ward Bond notices it and he turns away. He turns away. And that is like poetry to us, you know. And that's what and again on a big screen, the image of her folding the coat in VistaVision is much more powerful on television she becomes this big, on a small screen here, you know it's okay. But on a giant screen, he didn't need a close up. And so we were, it was just a average film goers beginning to discover the film, the depth of the film as we viewed it and as we got older. A good example of Ford's economy of means is when early on in "The Searchers" they've started their journey and John Wayne, who has a sense of doom that things are going to go badly, he rides up into a defile, a cleft in the mountains, and leaves the other two or three there and they watch him and he comes back and doesn't say anything but it's clear that he's found something terrible and probably the body of one of the settlers. And takes his knife and makes a gesture of frustration, terrible frustration and when they find the body of the Indian under the big rock, John Wayne shoots out his eyes, so that he can't travel among the four winds, he would have had no after life. He does it with a fury which is sort of pinned up, comes out from within, that's what I like about that film is this sense of real anger that's inside this man. And he comes out at all kinds, when they're being pursued by the Indians and he's defending the other side of the river with Ward Bond, Ward Bond's got this long stove pipe hat on and they're firing away and Wayne goes on firing long after it's necessary and finally Ward Bond, you know, pushes down the rifle and says stop, because he can't understand that Wayne's got this terrible, terrible anger in him for what's been done to the family at the beginning. I think that will always haunt him. "The Searchers" still holds up in terms of his racism, in terms of his own demons inside himself. And the camera tracking into his face, when he turns and he sees the two little Indian girls, the two white girls who were taken by the Indians, he's absolutely, the look in his eyes, that's an extraordinary actor and also very brave for the time because he was highly unpleasant character, a highly unlikeable character. I found him, I found Lucy. What you saw was a buck wearing Lucy's dress. I found Lucy back in the canyon. Was she? What do you want me to do draw you a picture, spell it out! Don't ever ask me! As long as you live don't ever ask me more! John Ford's films are very Catholic, this is another issue and they deal with morality and they deal with what's right and what's wrong in a very powerful way. Go, go Martin, please! Stand aside Martin! No you don't Ethan, Ethan no you don't! Stand aside! And as we grew and we watched the film on television, and I'm not talking about film critics, I'm talking about average guys, average kids, average young men who are basically film goers and film lovers, we were suddenly becoming aware of more subtext and more subtext in the picture and more subtext and once we caught on to Ethan Edwards' character, what was really going on inside of him, it became a whole different picture. Let's go home Debbie. The ending of "The Searchers" has fascinated students of the John Ford western world since it was first released in 1956. Maybe it does because it's an unhappy, happy ending, a loss girl, Natalie Wood is found and returned to her family, John Qualen and Olive Carey, Jeff Hunter and Vera Miles, the young lovers are reunited. But Ethan Edwards, the man the story was all about is left standing outside all alone. People have wondered what John Ford had meant by that. He's never answered, I can't answer for him, I can only tell you what I had in mind. When I crossed my arm, I did it the way Harry Carey used to do it, because his widow was on the other side of that door and he was the man Pappy said taught him his trade. One of the best examples of Ford's use of Monument Valley and of his incredible skill at framing a composition is the end of "The Searchers" where John Wayne goes out of the door way and in the background you see this bulk site orange of the rocks, the soil of Monument Valley and inside is pure darkness. It's as though he's at liberty finally, he's gone, he's freed from that burden of prejudice which has haunted him throughout the film. And then the door closes and that's the last shot of the picture and that is a shot which I'm sure Coppola used at the end of "The Godfather" where Diane Keaton is sent out of the room and the door closes behind you know. A lot of people have paid homage to Ford, even though they don't always admit that he's great and Orson Welles, of course, said that he watched "Stagecoach" 50 times before he made "Citizen Kane" and says John Ford, John Ford, John Ford was my teacher, we all know these legendary phrases. And Welles, in fact, was not at all like John Ford, I think, in the way he composed imagery but the spirit of Welles is in many ways like John Ford, particularly a film like, "Falstaff" or "Chimes of Midnight" where the character of "Falstaff" is absolutely out of John Ford, it really is, not just Shakespeare, you know, it's a John Ford character. Oh they're engraved and everything. This is good, to Jay Stewart. Well I appreciate it very much boss. For John Ford, making films has always been what he calls, "A job of work," but the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences has occasionally considered it more than just a living. In 1935, they presented an Oscar to John Ford for his direction of "The Informer." Five years later "The Grapes of Wrath" won him a second one. The next year, "How Green was my Valley" was voted best picture of the year and John Ford won an Oscar for directing it. In 1942, John Ford was in the Navy but he won an Oscar as the director and photographer on the documentary, "The Battle of Midway." And one year Commander Ford won his fifth Oscar for another documentary, "December 7th." In 1952, "The Quiet Man" put this one on his mantle. Six all together and not one of them for a western. Now maybe that's because the excellence of a John Ford western is something that we all take for granted or maybe it's because he's made so many of them that even he has lost count. On camera or backstage, music has always been an important part of John Ford's westerns. And by that I don't mean background music. Pappy always told me that "He'd rather hear good music than bad dialogue." But more than the music in a John Ford western means something, it evokes a sense of tradition, a nostalgia for simpler times when all hope lay ahead. There and I hope she's gonna stay Hope she's gonna stay The music in this scene, Maureen O'Hare in "Rio Grande" plays a different role. For John Ford, there was no need for dialogue, the music said it all. By the 1940's the score became something very solid, didn't it, the late 30's Korngold, by the late 30's, I think by the late 30's, Warner Brothers had it's style, MGM had it's style you know. Fox had it's style. And so when Bette Davis's is listening, let me tell, she tells William Wyler, which is a, is it, "Tell me one thing, when I'm going up those stairs, is it gonna be me going up the stairs or Max Steiner." 'Cause no matter what she did it was underscored, with this master use of big orchestra, but that was the style their wall to wall music. Max Steiner, everything at Warner Brothers wall to wall, shot to shot, not one piece of dialogue without music in the background. It was the style, that's all, it was style. And also "My Darling Clementine" when Linda Darnell is shot by accident, they operate on her on the table, remember and listen to the music in the background, it's Mexican, Mexican music and it works beautifully. It works beautifully counterpointing, again, literally what I'm saying counterpointing. But I understand to that Ford and many of the way these men worked at the time that often at the end of a movie, they'd give it over to the studio and Darryl Zanuck would put the score on. First kiss is always the sweetest From under a broad sombrero In "Stagecoach" Claire Trevor got the job. She played a bar room girl with a heart of gold. Ringo asked me to marry him. Is that wrong for a girl like me. If a man and woman love each other it's all right isn't it Doc? Don't you know that boy's headed back for prison? Besides, if you two go in the Lord's bed together, he's gotta know all about you. Ford's women are strong women and the woman is a tough character, not just in his westerns but also in a film like "The Grapes of Wrath" where Ma Joad is the pillar that holds the family together and never gives up and makes eventually this wonderful speech saying we the people, you know we go on, we will not be broken down by poverty and by exploitation. No, they are strong, you have the mother, Mrs. Jorgensen in "The Searchers" who is clearly a pioneer woman who's seen it all before and can't be shocked. So when news of somebody's death arrives, she doesn't shed a tear. It's her children who shed tears but she has become inured to this cruelty, this loss. Although they were beautifully dressed, they were frontiers women underneath and they had to survive. They often had to survive when their men folk left them for months and years at a time. Do you remember in "My Darling Clementine" when the wife arrives looking for her husband and they hadn't seen each other for months and months and months, but she's bot the courage to have taken the stagecoach into the wild west. Even disguised in eastern frills, John Ford's women lose none of their strength. In "My Darling Clementine" Cathy Downs could even get Henry Fonda's Wyatt Earp to take her to church. The scene is simple, clear and to the point but to the me what's just as important is the way John Ford treats the characters. His admiration for Wyatt Earp and others who won the west at gunpoint is almost reluctant. Powerful women like Clementine, the settlers and the schoolmarms, he gave his whole hearted respect. What'd you say? They said that, that they'd like to hear something from Mr. Stewart. In "Cheyenne Autumn," I remember you telling me that the reason you put me in as Wyatt Earp that the whole picture was kinda serious and it needed an intermission but you didn't want people to get out and get drinks and go to the bathroom, so you put me in as Wyatt Earp to keep them in their seats and it actually was an intermission on film, is that correct? Well, I don't know, Jimmy. Thank you, now would you hold that bottle up Miss? Hold up high. Now you, I want you to keep your eye right on that bottle, don't even blink. It's kinda like hypnotized. Keep your eye right on it Homer. Keep your eye right on the bottle. You're not gonna even feel it. Give me the bottle again. One side. Any chance I get to work with you or Henry I would leap at the chance, I mean, I mean, that's why I'm here today. Yeah, well. I'm very flattered and please. Well we love you boss. You're a hell of an intermissioner, an intermissionee, I'll say that much for you. The gag that I remember most was Mr. Henry performed on me. We're doing "Young Mr. Lincoln" and Henry, I'd never met Henry and the first time I saw him he was in makeup, this is true, isn't it? And we were up on location in Sacramento working on the river. So we finished and we got on the plane last night and this very upstanding young man sat by me and we started chatting, I said, "Would you like a smoke?" And he says, "No thanks, I have some cigarettes and you're smoking cigars." And I says, "We've met before haven't we?" He says, "Yes, I believe we have." I says, "Well, I mean, my name is John Ford." He says, "Fine my name is Henry Fonda." I said, "What!" And this is true isn't it? I had never seen him without the makeup and I didn't even recognize him. That's a true story. That was a prank you pulled on me. "Fort Apache" last western outpost. Here live the long, lean calvary men who fear no living soul. Here to are their women, wives, mothers, sweethearts. In "Fort Apache" Ford created his own version of the Battle of Little Bighorn with Henry Fonda and the roll model on Custer. Ford's version may be at variance with history but his interest was not in the man but in the hero. His concern was not with the assignment of blame or placement of... his interest was in the birth of a legend. To John Ford, "Fort Apache" was a eulogy to an era and perhaps his way of saying that heroes are men after all. Colonel if you send out the regiment, Cochise will think I tricked him. Exactly, we have tricked him, tricked him into returning to American soil and I intend to see that he stays here. Colonel Thursday, I gave my word to Cochise, no man is gonna make a liar out of me sir. Tell him I fight him without honor. Tell him they're not talking to me but United States government. Tell that government orders him to return to his reservation. And tell him if they have not started by dawn we will attack. Tell him that! And that's the point of view John Ford took on almost every western he ever made. And that's what John Ford he prints the legend and that's a fact. What's interesting is that whenever a John Ford hero arrives in Monument Valley whether it be John Wayne or whether it be Henry Fonda, they have nothing to their name. In the case of John Wayne and "The Searchers" you know he's come there after the Civil War, his side has lost, he really comes almost as an exile and the same when Henry Fonda arrives in Tombstone in "My Darling Clementine" you feel these are characters who have left behind a life and they're trying to start something new and pure in this wonderful landscape and that's where he uses Monument Valley so well. He makes it a clean, pure place where human beings can play out there, their emotions and start a new life. I am not sure that all Ford's characters are fallen heroes because some are people who fall during the film in "Fort Apache." Henry Fonda's character is very, very unpleasant but he comes to a bad end during the film actually where as it usually it's the other way around. Ford characters arrive with a lot of grief in their background but they end the film purged and strengthened but in the case of Fonda in "Fort Apache" it's the other way around, it's very tragic. John Ford has said that "The best things in film happen by accident" and he may be right. When I went out to what used to be the back lot of 20th Century Fox, I didn't expect to find him there. Henry how are you? - I'm here. Last time we worked together was in "Mr. Roberts" and the first time was in "Young Mr. Lincoln." You remember where you are, you recognize this? No I don't, this is the damnest place. He told me that a writer had come to see him that week to interview him. The result, I gathered satisfied him but didn't give the writer much material to work with. I didn't tell him anything. John Ford will talk about anything but himself. That makes him an easy man to like and a hard man to explain. That was the unique thing about working with Ford, he made you feel related to each other. Actors, technicians, everybody, part of his family. I'm not saying that he's not the hard nosed, cantankerous, do it my way or not at all director he claims he is but he's also a sentimentalist and there are several generations of film workers who will vouch for that. One of the things about Ford which, of course, is common to perhaps most of the really great directors in the history of the cinema, he created a team, a small team not just of actors but of technicians who stayed with him throughout his life. I remember at the Cannes Film Festival when they paid a tribute to Ford in the 90's suddenly I found myself setting next to Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Junior and they would say that the fun of being with Ford was not in front of the camera, it was behind the camera at the end of the day when they would have drinking sessions or play cards and there was a camaraderie amongst those people, those characters like Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, they always played supporting roles but they were important supporting roles. And he used the same editors and costume designers and so on throughout his career. Ford didn't start work on his screen, on shooting his films till he was absolutely sure that the screen play was in good shape and he used throughout his career some very important screen writers. So it was a team effort, it wasn't just Ford, he had the overall vision but I think some of the economy of it comes from the way his actors understood him and knew how to communicate with a glance or a snarl or a laugh and knew how to communicate the emotion. You're the one that found me. Yes ma'am. Will you save my baby? Yes, ma'am I'll save you. And I will help. Me too ma'am. I want you, all of you to be my baby's godfathers. In my opinion gents taking a bath is the least of the troubles confronting little Robert. Robert William. Robert William Bezo. Comedy is what John Ford claims he does best, and I don't wanna argue with him but somebody said, I think it was Orson Welles, that John Ford is as much a poet as he is a comedian. Maybe he's both, for sure he's a sentimentalist. And Ford's legacy lives on because he influenced a small but considerably important band of directors. First and foremost Akira Kurosava who modeled his samurai world on the world of the western hero. And so Toshiro Mifune in films like "Seven Samurai" in "Rashomon" he is very much like the cowboys of John Ford and he used the landscape. He couldn't get to Monument Valley but he used the landscape so well in a film like "The Hidden Fortress" for example which is filled with rocky valleys and defiles and the sense of nature being larger than the human beings within it. And in turn Sergio Leone was influenced by Kurosava and he remade some of Kurosava's films as westerns but those westerns echo very much the films of John Ford, particularly "The Good the Bad and the Ugly," "Once Upon a Time in the West" have these huge horizons and skies and deserts which Ford used so well. When you see a film like "Lawrence of Arabia" you can also see how David Lean was influenced by Monument Valley and John Ford, particularly towards the beginning of the film when Lawrence first goes out and he meets the veteran guide and they look down together and the guide says, "Bedouin, bedouin out there," they can't at first see through the binoculars and then finally they see this group of men moving on camels through this vast, vast valley. Then I suppose you could also say that he's had an indirect influence on directors like Scorsese and Lucas particularly in the "Star Wars" films. But nevertheless the spirit of John Ford lives on in those film makers. They were good years, very good years. When this was the back lot of 20th Century Fox, back lot's gone now. It's been homesteaded. I think the people admire John Ford because of his use of what I would call the grammar of film. He could put together a sequence extremely well. He could structure a film extremely well. He knew how to keep the rhythm going and I think that what people like is the way that he could direct actors so easily, he could put his camera in the right place at the right time. He knew when to cut and he knew when to really bring a scene to a climax and bring a sequence to a climax in a way that creates a shock effect. So I think modern directors admire that. Like Jimmy Stewart says, "When it comes to a choice between what really happened and what should have happened, John Ford prints the legend." in working with John Ford it's pretty hard not to pick up a few facts about making pictures. One of his first rules is not to pack too many ideas in one scene and the second don't talk too much. Come on, go, go. Thanks. I like that, he just takes it and says thanks. They want action pictures damn it, it's what we're getting paid for. Try it again. Print the other two takes. He had a wonderful eye for landscape and for long shots as I've said that Howard Hochs felt he did the best long shots in the history of the cinema so he saw in Monument Valley the idea of man being dwarfed by nature and so he hardly ever looks at his characters, straight up, he looks at them almost either flat on or from above. There is a place in Monument Valley called John Ford Point. There are two or three scenes in various films where John Wayne in particular comes to the edge of that and he watches Indians in the plain below and Ford's camera is behind and above him. So you always have this sense of immense space and I think he took advantage of this, there was nothing to compare it with, there were no towns, no cities by which to judge that. And so that's why the sky is so important and he loved this silhouettes, he loved silhouettes and he used it not just at Monument Valley but if you take a film like "The Horse Soldiers" towards the end of his career made in 1960, there there are several wonderful shots of riders against the horizon and he did that throughout his work so that that bottom third of the frame is the riders and the top two is the sky because the sky is always more important than the human beings certainly. Jack Ford made all or part of nine westerns here in Monument Valley. When we came back in June it was the first time we had been here together in 15 years. The valley hadn't change, it never does but we had. Mostly just getting older I guess. I came back to reminisce and I got the feeling that maybe Pappy came back to say goodbye. He was gonna take that over again, I said, no, I have a knowledge are you kidding, cross out the action, wasn't any action, I... Wayne almost rolled over me. I said "Oh I think it looks good." I did too, just got right up on his. Memories come back. When I pass on I wanna be remembered as John Ford, the guy that made westerns. I'm not a career man, I never was. I'm just hard nosed, hard working director. They'd hand me a script, I says "This oughta make a fair picture, this will make a good picture." I think it's gonna be a lousy picture but you have a schedule so I'll go ahead and do the best I can with it. But I never felt important or thought I was a career director or genius or any other damn thing.
