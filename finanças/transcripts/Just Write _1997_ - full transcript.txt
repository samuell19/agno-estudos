He had no idea. He thought they stole shoes. I knew exactly what my parents did. They ran a tour bus company and my father had this tour bus cap and it was like a crown. I used to give my super special tour to all the kids in the neighborhood, they loved it. I didn't want to go to heaven or hell like everybody else, I wanted to go to Beverly Hills. I wanted to roam through the mansions and just see whatever movie stars do when no one's around. From the time I was six years old I knew what I wanted to do, you know, I wanted to be a tour bus driver. And I'm pretty good at it. (upbeat rock music) Nice to see you governor, welcome to Trolleywood Tours. Excellent. I don't know if you're tall enough to go on this ride but please enjoy yourself. We have a metal detector so anything you're wearing could be used against you in a court of law, nice to see you, welcome to Trolleywood Tours.

I guess I'll do the rest of the tour acapella everybody. Welcome to Beverly Hills. Your first attraction is here on your left. John Travolta is actually adding a wing to his home, and right next to him, Sharon Stone. I think they may even be building a tunnel underneath. Can only imagine what those pajama parties are like. And right up here on the right we have the home where Gloria Swanson used to live. You remember Gloria from the film Sunset Boulevard. She played the actress that shot the young writer William Holden in the back. But that was years ago. Today we have the director for that. Today we have the director for that. Wow. I know this mic is on because I can here you sleeping. Right here on your left I believe Zsa Zsa Gabor slapped Cher's pool boy 16 times. Ha ha, that's not true, kidding. (bell dings) If you look up to your left ladies and gentlemen you'll see two wonderful tennis courts. The Van Pattens live here. You know Dick Van Patten from TV's Eight is Enough. Wonderful man. Combs his hair from right here, throws it all the way over. Everybody wins. A little bit of trivia for you guys. Spencer Tracy was brought out of retirement by Katherine Hepburn to do one last film. That film was Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? Starring opposite the pioneer in his own right Mr. Sidney Poitier who happens to live right to the left of us. Mr. Sidney Poitier. Okay. I believe Jean Claude Van Damme made an offer on that home right there. - Oh oh oh! - Okay. (bell dings) We're gonna take this side street right here, I'll tell you why. If you look to your left I believe Arnold Schwarzenegger owns the entire block. Oh man. Oh and right here is the home of Amanda Clark, everybody. Probably the finest young actress around. She's completed 10 films in the past six years and is rumored to be doing her next film with Brad Pitt, a thriller. She's quite an actress. Now coming up right here on your right is a church where so many celebrities get married. In fact, the church is so popular that they keep coming back to do it again and again. And again. They can't stop doing it. That's a joke about how many times celebrities get married. Alright. (organ music) (flashing) - My dear friends. You have come together in this church... For richer or for poorer, preferably richer. In sickness, and in health. From this day forward, for as long as you both shall live and rock on? - [Bride] Eh, that depends. - You're supposed to say I do. - [Bride] Hey. I know what I'm supposed to say. And what I'm saying is it depends. - Okay. It depends? - Yeah. On what you plan on doing with the rest of your life. Come on, you can't go on being just a tour guide. I want to be with someone successful, a lawyer, a CEO. - Or a doctor. - I didn't go to college. (gasping) - What? - [Bride] You didn't go to college? - No. - [Bride] Everybody who's anybody goes to college! I mean really, that is the least you could have done. - Now hold on, I thought that we were in love. - [Bride] Oh please. (scoffs) (laughs) Don't hand me that emotional crap. No, I want bucks, big bucks. - Come on, there's more to life than just money. - Bull! - Like what? - Like-- - [Bride] And don't give me that love stuff. - Alright alright alright. What about movies? (laughing) Yeah what about movies? - Movies? - Yeah movies. - Movies? - Yeah, I love-- - [Bride] All you know about is movies? - No I know about, I know about, I know-- - [Bride] Oh pal here you gotta forget this. I am just so outta your league. (wedding march) - You see Dolly, you shoulda listened to your mother. You shoulda married your gynecologist. - Don't look at me pal. I get paid either way. - What? What? - Can we go now? - Oh, okay, here we go, we're moving on. We're gonna move on. Well that includes another tour of the rich and infamous, thank you very much. Seriously you guys, thank you for choosing Trolleywood Tours. See you later ma'am, enjoy your trip here. Y'all come back now, hear? Thank you, enjoy your stay. - Excuse me? - Sure. - I'm sorry to bother you. We were wondering if you knew any place that we could like go and see a movie star. - Yeah, they're all over the place. But there are a couple place but they're pretty pricey, I know you can see some folks. - That's fine, we're from Wisconsin and we're splurging. - Ah, there you go. Well my friend Danny is a bartender at a place called Mandalay. - Mm hmm. - Right down Hollywood Boulevard, left, and it's right there on Melrose. - Okay good. - Great. - Thank you! - Thank you so much. - Maybe we'll see you there. - Maybe. See you later. - Bye. - Good luck. Hey. Subway construction's still going on, Cahuenga's a mess. What's going on? - I was on the phone 10 days ago and they told me emphatically I had a 90 day extension. They are just a bunch of lying bastards. Those bastards at the bank are trying to close us down, Harold. - Dad, you wanted the new trolley and you know about these payments. You know what we need? We need a lawyer and we need a payment plan. - What lawyer? Lawyer my ass. What we oughta get a gun for them liars, boom, bow! Dead banker! - You know what-- - I don't have it. - We need to get some food in you 'cause you shouldn't kill on an empty stomach. - I just don't have it. I don't know where I'm gonna get the money, this is stupid. - Here we go, come on. You alright? - He told me I could have this extension, I swear on my mother. What about the tape deck? - [Harold] Tape deck's broken, Dad. - [Dad] Well what are you doing about it? - [Harold] Well I'm telling stories, I'm having fun you know? - Oh hey I almost forgot, happy birthday. - Thank you, it was the other day. - No, it's no, it's the 11th, March 11th. - March 7th, that's my birthday. - I am so sorry. - That's alright. - I always get those two mixed up. - Don't worry about it. - Wow, what are you, 28? No you're 29, right? - 30, Dad. - 30? - 30 years old. - 30? - 30. - You mean you're 30 and you don't even have a girlfriend yet? What's that about? What it is is you gotta get out more. Get drunk, get laid, do something. It's all those damn movies you watch. - Yeah sure Dad. - You're like your mother was, god bless her. A dreamer. You do still like girls, don't you? - Yeah, I like 'em a lot Dad. - So what is the big deal? - Well. I think a lot of girls in this town they care more about like what car you drive and where you live than who you are, and I gotta find a woman who loves me for who I am. That's it. - That's all you want? No tits, no-- - Well yeah, it would be great if she was attractive but-- - Hey, nothing is impossible Harold. I married your mother, right? (light music) 30, 30, wow. - Yeah. - If only you had my looks. - So what you got about six weeks on this cast Dad? I'll be happy when you get this thing off. - You'll be happy? I miss the track, everything itches. (jazzy music) ♪ It's a funny kinda feeling ♪ It's cut me to the core - Hi can I help you? - Yeah, my buddy Danny's actually right there. ♪ Dripping from the ceiling ♪ Naked on the floor - Oh my god. Never thought I'd see you here. What is it, your birthday? - Oh I met a couple girls on the trolley, I thought maybe they'd be here. - You, looking for girls? - Yes. - Next thing I know you'll be drinking, smoking, moussing your hair. - Well you know I gotta start somewhere, right? - I'm glad to hear it man, glad to hear it. You know I was gonna call you anyway. - What's up? - I got a part in a play. - No! - Yeah. - That's great. - It doesn't pay anything but it's good exposure. - Yeah? - Yeah. Half the time I got my clothes off. - Hey, you know, kids'll love that, right? (laughing) - Danny. (clinking glasses) - Come here. - Come over here. Come on! - Come here! - Come on! - Play with us! - That's my fan club. - That's very very nice for you. - [Woman] Hey baby. - [Woman] Hey come on. - Just one little minute. - Oh, you are such a man. Get over here. (giggling) - Look at that. They know things I don't. (laughing) - You know if I tell them that you're a producer I probably could fix you up man. - Oh, I will beg you not to do that, seriously. (laughing) - Alright man. What'll you have? Coke. - Coke. Yeah. Actually make it a double. - On the rocks? - Ice spoils the drink. - Drink, yeah. Got it. I'll be right back. - Thanks man. - No, no way! Absolutely not. Tell him he's always been a cheapskate and you can quote me. Can you believe this place? I have to go outside to make a goddamn phone call? Nothing but static. Alright, where were we? - I was trying to tell you why I shouldn't do this role, not the way the script reads now. - We're about to sign the contracts. Look, your last picture grossed 30 mil. We're about to break you out. This is the picture that will do it. I don't understand, I practically gave them my word. - I know that Sidney, I'm sorry, but... The script needs to be rewritten. I mean it's really awful. - It's got a few problems but you've gotta admit it's a great story. - I'll admit it's a good idea. - So what do you want? We got the best writer in the business, the man is a genius. - Maybe but he obviously does not like women. - Samuel T. Lewis does not like women, are you kidding? He loves women! He's schtupped every secretary and starlet from Beverly Hills to Malibu. As a matter of fact I think I... Yeah well that's another story. - Sid, I didn't say he doesn't sleep with women, I said he doesn't like them. - Look Mandy we know men are pigs, especially writers, but look where we are, we're in Hollywood. We're not gonna turn this into some kind of a crusade, are we? - No, we're not. Sid, I just want the role to be more real. Thank you. I mean did you ever see All About Eve? It's like Anne Baxter's character, she seemed so innocent and charming but what she really wants is Bette Davis's role in the play. - All About Eve, I thought Paul Newman's wife was in that. - No no no, that's Three Faces of Eve. - Oh, well, whatever. - Okay let's get more specific. I'll show you, I'll show you some stuff in here. I mean some of it's even kind of funny, it's-- (phone ringing) - Oh, hang on. - Oh, Sid. - Sid Stone, what's up? Damnit you're breaking up. (sighs) Can you believe this place? I might as well be on the moon. I'll be right back. - Sid, how can we talk about this if you keep taking the phone calls? - Last one, last one I promise, it's Spielberg. - Oh, Spielberg, okay. - Steven. Steven? (scoffs) Jimmy, I gotta use your office phone. (sighs) - So what do you do? - I'm a writer, screenwriter. - Oh, that's interesting. So am I. So who's your agent? - Arthur Blake at CCI. - You must be doing very well. - Mm hmm. - So where can I see your work? - [Man] Where or when? - [Woman] That's funny. - Did you see who's here? - Nn nn. - She is so fine. Oh my. In the corner booth. - Who are you talking about? - Amanda Clark. ♪ First time I saw you did you see my head ♪ Going round and round and round - Did you see that? - What? - She was looking at me. - Oh stop! - She looked at me just now, give me your pen. - Why? - Give me your pen, I wanna get her autograph. - Come on man this ain't that kinda place, Harold. They come here to get away from that man. - You're right, you're right about that. What am I thinking? I'm gonna go over and say hi to her. - Cool, but whatever you do, don't tell her you're a tour bus driver, they hate you guys. - I forgot about that. Forget about it, I'm kidding myself. - Oh now go on now, go ahead. Now you'll never forgive yourself if you don't. Go ahead. Just be smooth. You look great. ♪ I watch your mouth moving around and round and round ♪ And round and round ♪ Oh no I don't put my head down ♪ Put my head down ♪ And no don't you put my down but rest your head - I'm Harold McMurphy, I'm a big-- (coughs) Fan. Sorry. I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry. - It's okay. Thank you. - Yeah. Thank me for what? - Oh for being my fan? - Oh are you kidding? Easiest thing. I've seen every movie you've ever made. - You have? - Yeah. Yeah. Last one with Stallone, I only saw it twice. (giggles) Not a big fan of that one but Sunset Cafe was just such amazing work. The last scene when your heart was broken, you were doomed, everyone knew it, and then you let out that nervous laugh, it was...it was the best I've ever seen on film. - Thank you. - You're gonna think I'm insane but you reminded me of Montgomery Clift in A Place in the Sun. Not that you remind me of a man, you couldn't be more of a woman. (giggles) And, you know, I'm still talking, god. But it was like a Vivian Leigh thing, it was like a combo. You had that vulnerability like that she had in Streetcar Named Desire. - Wow. That's very perceptive of you. I actually based my character on Blanche. - Really? - Yeah. - [Harold] That's amazing. - Yeah, you must know a lot about film. - Yeah well it goes along with my job. - Really? - Yeah. - So what do you do? - Do? - I mean, what do you for a living. - I, uh... I go around and I tell stories. - Oh. So you're a writer. - Something like that, yeah, yeah. - So who's your agent? - I'm sorry, who's my agent? - Your agent. - I'm not gonna call you, you have to call me. - My agent is Arthur Blake at CCI. - Really? - Yeah. - Wow, you must be doing very well. I think I met him one time. Is he real tall man, good looking? - Uh yeah, that's probably him. Um, you just do great work and I just want to thank you and I'm not really a guy that does this but I'm gonna go. - You know what, can I ask you something? Would you mind just sitting here with me for a little while? It's stupid, I feel kind of self conscious sitting here by myself. - Sit down? - I mean unless you're in a hurry. - No, I thought your friend was sitting here. I saw the woman... - Oh, who, Sidney? Sidney's not my friend, she's my agent. We're sitting here, we're supposed to be talking about this screenplay and she keeps running and using the phone, so. - Oh, I'd love to sit down with you. - Great, thanks a lot. So you said your name's Harold, right? - [Harold] Yeah. - Harold. Harold I have a proposition for you. - Proposition? - Yeah. Well you must be a good writer because otherwise you wouldn't be with CCI and you obviously know a lot about film and see I have this screenplay and it's got some problems and I was just wondering if maybe you wouldn't mind reading it for me and telling me what you think. I know you probably think I've got a lot of nerve asking somebody I don't even know, I'm sure you get asked to do this all the time. It's just that I feel kinda pressed and I really need somebody who'll give me an honest answer. And I mean it seems like fate, you know? You being here and being a writer and I need a writer. Look, if you don't want to do it I understand. - No, I mean of course I would do it. I'd love to, I'd be honored. - Really? - Yeah. Is this the thriller with Brad Pitt? - Yeah, how'd you know that? - I saw a little spot on ET the other night. - Really? - Mm hmm. - So you really wouldn't mind reading it for me? I'd appreciate it so much. - No, no, I would, I'd be honored. - That's great, that's great! Maybe we could meet tomorrow, say four o'clock at the Beachside Cafe and talk about it? - Tomorrow, four o'clock. - Is that possible? - No, that, I think I could fit that in my schedule. - Okay, great! Then it's a date. I mean, you know. (laughs) Okay, so I'll see you then. - Hi, how are you? - Alright. - [Amanda] So I'll see you tomorrow then. - Yeah. - Oh wait, don't forget this! - Oh, was gonna walk out. Alright. - [Amanda] Thank you. - Who the hell was that? - Oh that was Harold McMurphy, the writer. - Oh, yeah. I like his stuff. (sirens wailing) - Dude, what happened man? - I got a date. - You and Amanda Clark? - Yes. I lied though. - Yeah I know you lied, but what did you say? - I don't know. I just, I think I'm gonna be sick. - Okay but write that down 'cause whatever you said I'll use it man, I sw... Damn. Harold hooked up with Ama... I can't believe that. - [Harold] I don't even get what you're saying, Dad. - I'm saying this might be a good time for you to see my astrologer friend. You know, just to see how things work out. - Who, Lulu? Maybe. - She's a psychic too. I told her all about you. She's about your age, divorced, and, check, this out. Extremely interesting to look at if you get my drift. - I think I do, Dad. - Yeah. She might be nice to have around. She'd always know what we wanted to eat. Get it? - Hey hey, anybody home? - Hey Danny. - Hey Danny! Let yourself in. I know you'll forgive me if I don't get up. - From what I heard you haven't been up in a while. - Oh that's cute Dan. - What are you doing? - Please, I got two minutes man, please. - Yeah I know and you're wearing that? - Yeah. - Hey hey, leave him alone, he looks great. It's not like she's interested in him personally. Come on, she's just looking for some cheap advice. - Maybe, maybe not. How do you know what she has in mind, Rip Van Cripple? Maybe what she really wants is to seduce him. Take off that shirt. - Danny, come on. - Maybe that's what her plan was all along. Come on man, women are not like men. They're unpredictable. - Yeah, like your career. (laughs) - Oh that hurts. Take off that ugly shirt. - Why, what are you talking about? - It says loser loser loser. - Come on. - Take it off, man! - Why? - You're gonna wear mine. - What are you talking about? - I'm telling you man. These are the threads I got off my last modeling gig. Women love this stuff. - Oh come on, she already thinks I'm a writer. Now she's gonna think I'm a writer with really nice clothes? - Hey it's a dog eat dog world out there. With a knick knack paddywhack she might just be looking for a bone. - I wanna see you in this though. - I don't think so, I can't. - No, this, here. - I got a good place for this. - Enjoy. - Salvation Army. Boys Club. Where'd you get this man? - I can't wait to see you in that. You will be the original Urkel. - Hey Urkel gets some fine women, you know? Let me put this on. (surf rock music) - Wait! - How you doing? Listen, do me a huge favor. Park this as far away from the cafe as possible, okay? Yeah, like Cleveland. Thanks man. (light music) - So you sure you don't wanna stay? We're just gonna be talking about the script and-- - Thanks sweetie but I'm kinda busy, you know? A lot of catching up to do. - [Amanda] What kind of busy? - [Rich] I gotta check out the new Jag today, I got a massage in the afternoon, got a lot of errands to run, you know how it is. - Okay. - But I'll miss you though. (clears throat) - Hey, how are you? - Doing well, thank you. - Good, it's good to see you, you look great. That's a great outfit. - Oh, thank you. It's not mine. The whole outfit's my friend Danny's. - [Amanda] Really? So what'd he do, outgrow it? - No, he didn't have time to. (laughing) - It's very GQ. - Oh I'm sorry, Rich Adams this is Harold McMurphy. Harold, this is Rich Adams. - Nice to meet you Rich. - Yeah. You know what I guess I better get going. - Okay. - Okay. - You wanna stop by later? - I don't know. You know I gotta get up really early in the morning, I've gotta play tennis with Pierce tomorrow. You know how it is. But I'll give you a call. - Okay. - Okay babe? - Okay, okay. Bye. - Nice meeting you. - Right on. - So how you doing? - I'm doing alright, how are you doing? - I'm good. - Good. - Thank you so much for coming. - Oh, thank you for inviting me. - Thank you. - Yeah. My father's a fan of Rich's. - Really? - Yeah, likes his show. Even more than Baywatch Nights. - Wow. - Yeah. Did I interrupt you guys? - No, not at all. I was waiting here for you. So can I get you something to drink? - Yeah, I'd love a Coke would be great. - Coke, okay. Can we... - I wanted to know what happens, I cared, you know? - Yeah. - Definitely. - Wow. - Yeah. - So what you're saying is you really think it's not that bad? - No I mean as it is right here it's solid. You know? (groans) - I don't know. I mean I guess I think so too. It's sad without being melodramatic. - Definitely, definitely. - And that's probably the best part about it, don't you think? - Yeah. Good supporting characters you know and then an uplifting feeling at the end. It's like life affirming. - Yeah it makes you care, I mean you really care about the characters, that makes it work. - Definitely, definitely. Um, um, how are we doing? (laughing) - I think not, I'm still not convinced. - No, no? - No. - I don't know if I am either. - Oh god. Okay, more wine, that will help. - No no no no no. Two glasses I turn into an animal. - Oh really? - Yes, I start looking for caves and I need to hibernate for the winter, it's very ugly. (laughing) I snore like a spider monkey. Very ugly. - Spider monkey. - Yeah. (soft music) - You know what Harold I really appreciate everything you've done. - Oh man. - I just think I should just do it the way it is and... - I wish I could have been more help. - No, you've been lots of help, really. - You know I couldn't help but think while I was reading it... Nah. - What? - No it's something I was thinking and it's not even worth telling you. - No please. - It's... You know the movie All About Eve? - Yes, I do. - This ain't it. (laughing) No no, that's not why I brought it up. Anne Baxter's character, right? - [Amanda] Right. - If your role was more like that in the beginning. - Mm hmm. - You know, complete innocence and then made that turn into doing whatever it took. - Mm hmm. - You know to get Bette Davis's role, that pit bull kind of a thing, it would lift the entire script and it would definitely be worth doing. And it's not here. She's one dimensional, you know, and I got this feeling and you're gonna think I'm crazy but I don't know if this guy likes women, the writer. (laughing) - Oh my god! That's amazing! - What? - That is exactly what I said to my agent. - Really? - I swear. Harold that is exactly what I said to my agent. She didn't listen to me, she thought I was crazy. Hey you know what? I have an idea. - What? - We're gonna go find Sidney, my agent, and we're gonna talk to her about this. You're gonna tell her what you just told me. - Oh no no no no, listen I don't think that would be appropriate. - No it would be! - 'Cause I probably... I don't think I'd even, who knows, I probably am wrong about this. - Harold please, please do this, I just want you to tell her your opinion. It's so close to mine and she would, I think she'll listen. I mean you're a good writer and... Come on, we'll go. Do you mind? - I have money. - No no no it's okay, you're my guest, please. Please Harold? Please do this for me? - Okay. - Okay, let's go. Let's get outta here. Okay, so your car or mine? - Uh, your car would be great, I took the bus. - You took the bus, why'd you take the bus? - Yeah well because you know no one takes the bus anymore and it's a great way to see the town. - Okay. - Be fun. - Okay. I can't wait to tell her. Ah!

I don't go out for different reasons. - Amanda! Darling! I'm so happy you could make it! I'd known you were coming I would have sent you an invitation. - Oh. - Listen.

Nothing I could, can't really, shouldn't talk about it actually. - You know how writers are. - I know, that's why I handle actors. - [Amanda] So Harold read the Lewis script. - Already? - Yeah. - Yes he did and he saw something that I think you might have missed. - Alright, and what might that be? - Well I just felt that the writer, you know, I felt that he doesn't like women. - Oh really? - Yeah. - I wonder where he would get an idea like that? - Well, actually just from the script, from reading the script. I just felt that he should infuse some of the integrity he uses with the male characters into the female characters. - Mm hmm. - Exactly. You see, I'm not the only one Sid. - Well that's just great. Sounds like the two of you have a lot in common. - Sid, I want a meeting with the studio tomorrow. - Would you excuse us for a moment? - Certainly. - Could we talk? Amanda, honey, what's happening to you? Who was it who discovered you in your high school play? Sidney Stone. Who got you your first movie? Sidney Stone. And who stuck her ass out to get you this Brad Pitt film? Me, Sidney Stone! And now you're telling me that this, this hack knows best? - Shh. - Who is he? I have racked my brain, I have never heard of him. And now you want a meeting at the studio over some no-name? - Yes, I do. Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. (sighs) Love you Sid. Harold, I'm sorry she was so rude. - It's alright, it's not your fault. - I shouldn't have dragged you out here. - That's alright. What does she do for you again? - Oh Justin. I sense a miniseries in your future. - So you wanna stay and party? - Uh no, I actually don't. (laughing) - I don't think so. - I'm Rich. - [Tiffany] I'm Tiffany. This is a beautiful suit. - [Rich] Listen, why don't we go for a little walk? And uh-- - Oh excuse me. Really nice. - Who was that? - That's my cousin. You know what, give me a minute. I'll be back in a minute. - Harold. - Yeah. - I'm gonna steal you, I'm not gonna give you back. - Okay. - Have you ever thought about directing? - I haven't. - Listen to this. You, Tom Cruise, and Amanda, triple threat. - Okay. - Listen, by the way, are you seeing anyone? - Excuse me. - Harold, Harold, hi, Joey Ace, how are you? - Hey Joe, hey Joe. - I got a project I'm working on, I think it's absolutely perfect for you. - Right. - I'll give you 30 seconds. Tom Arnold. - Tom Arnold. - Okay broken down rodeo clown. - Broken down rodeo clown. - Losing his job to Rhea Pearlman. - Everybody wins, everybody wins. - Let's do lunch. Joey Ace, love your work. (murmuring) - You get my car please. - Amanda. Amanda. - Just leave me alone okay? - Calm down, it's not what you think. - It's exactly what I think, you lied to me. - When did I lie to you? Oh come on, I thought we trusted each other. - Yeah, so did I. - Yeah and I thought that you understood that sometimes I need to be seen with other people. I mean, for publicity. It's just for business. Come on, I thought we had an agreement. - What agreement? You only agree with yourself Rich, give me a break. - Oh, oh give you a break, I see. - Yeah. - So it's okay for you to go to a party with some jerk but it's not okay for me. - Hey, Harold McMurphy is not a jerk okay? The only reason we-- - Yes he is. - Came to this house was to see Sidney, that's it. - Come on, let's go. - You know bud, if you know what's good for you you'll stay out of this, alright? - Be careful, I take vitamins. Come on. I'm driving, it's what I do best. - You know what? I'll call you. Okay? I'll call you. Jerk. He's a jerk. ♪ Open your eyes if you want to start a fire ♪ Turn out the lights ♪ Let me take you higher girl ♪ Oh yeah - I'm sorry for acting like such a schoolgirl back there. - Here, blow your nose, you'll feel better. - I don't wanna ruin your handkerchief. - No no no, I'll be completely offended if you don't. It came with the jacket. None of it's mine. - Thanks. - Sure. You know Jimmy Stewart lived across the street when he was shooting It's A Wonderful Life. - Did he really? - Yeah. - I love that movie. I mean every Christmas I watch that movie when it comes on. - Oh, me too. First time I saw it my father let me stay up late and as I was watching it the sun came up and it was a white Christmas 'cause we were back east. It was the perfect way to see it, I'll never forget that. It was great. - I really want to thank you for taking care of that situation back there, I mean it was like... And for taking vitamins. - Oh god. (laughing) What did I say? It was a psychotic diversion. You know they say when someone tries to rob you that you immediately ask them what time it is. They don't know what to do. He didn't know what to do. - It worked. - Yeah it did, somehow it did. Thanks for tonight, it was really nice hanging out with you. I'm gonna get outta here. I gotta, it's getting late, thank you. - You wanna come in and get some hot chocolate or something? - With some marshmallows? - Hmm. - S'mores? - Okay. - Campfire, crosslegged? - I think we can... (laughing) - You really want me to come in? - You're funny. You always make me laugh. Yeah, that would be nice. Come on in. - I'd love to. - Great. - Come on.

Look at like the eyelashes and stuff. - She's beautiful. - Look at that wig. - What's up with that? - It's Halloween, what am I? - I don't know you're a cutie though. You got the blue eyeshadow. (laughing) I'm surprised you don't have the puka shells though. I had them stapled to my neck. (soft music) There you go. You knew you had it going on though right there, those little blue eyes. (laughing) Beautiful. You always had them, huh? - Well sometimes they look blue, sometimes they look green or gray, look. Just it depends on what I'm wearing, what the colors are. They reflect. - Oh. Kinda like a mood ring, right? - Exactly. (laughing) - Yeah? Oh my god you look different. (laughing) Wait that's you right there? Is that a birthday party? Where are the little kids? - Uh, yeah. That's a weird story. Okay we had just moved here from Atlanta. - Mm hmm. - It was my birthday and my mom wanted me to have this birthday party but I hadn't really made any friends yet so she said that's okay, you can just take these invitations to school and pass them out and then the kids will show up. Everyone loves a birthday party, right? - [Harold] Yeah. - So I did it and the day of the party comes and no one shows up. Not one person. - I'd have been there. (dramatic music) What are these? These are recent huh? - Oh yeah, god I didn't know those were in there. - You and Rich. - Yeah. (sighs) - You alright with that? I'm sure everything's gonna work out with you guys, right? - No no no, it won't work out. I've known about this for a while, I just didn't want to believe it. - Yeah. - Yeah. I'm gonna tell him it's over. - Really? - Mm hmm. - That's what you want? - Yeah, that's what I want. - What does he want? - I don't care what he wants. I mean, this isn't the first time it's happened. - Oh. - If I'm gonna have a relationship I want it to be with someone that I can trust. Someone that can always tell me the truth, it's important. Don't you think? - I got something to tell you. - What's up? - I had a really nice time and I've got to go. - Okay. - And I need my coat. - Okay. - That's what I wanted to tell you. Come on, thank you. - So you sure you don't need a ride home? - No, no I'm gonna walk. My friend Danny lives not to far from here, I've gotta give him his clothes back. - Okay. - Yeah. So I was thinking that maybe you and I could, you know, we could go out. I mean not go out go out but that we could talk about the script some more and stuff 'cause I could, um, get some... It's not a good idea, it's probably a bad idea, it's-- - Harold. - You know. - I'd love to go out with you. - You would? - Yeah. - When? - Uh, tomorrow. (laughing) - That would be great, I'd love that. - Okay. - Seven o'clock. - Great. - Seven o'clock. - Seven o'clock. - I'll see tomorrow night, seven o'clock. - Okay. - Okay. See you later. - Okay. (laughing) Bye. Hey you sure you don't need a ride? - [Harold] No no no I need air. I'm gonna get so much air I'm gonna hover, I'm a hovercraft.

So fix it honey, fix it! Ciao. Rich Adams, can I get you anything? Drink, cigarette? - Listen Sidney. Amanda and I, last night we had a fight at the party. - So everybody heard. Go talk to her. If that doesn't work, try jewelry. - Well it's not that simple. I mean I know this sounds unbelievable but I think she's seeing another guy. Some jerk I saw her with at the party last night. What's his name, it starts with an M. McMillan, McMurray, something like that. - McMurphy, Harold McMurphy. - Yeah, McMurphy, Harold McSmurfy. What do you know about him? - Well he's a pain in my ass but you don't need to be stressed out about a guy like Harold.

(laughing) Actually I was gonna ask you this before but I didn't. I was just wondering if maybe you'd be interested in doing the rewrite on the screenplay. - Me do the rewrite? - Yeah. You're the perfect choice. - Huh. You know what? I don't-- - Listen, if it's money you're worried about don't because Sidney will talk to your agent, she'll talk to the studio-- - Oh my agency, you know what if I'm not what you think I am? Do you know? What if I can't do it as well as you deserve it to be done? - Oh come on. No but you're a good writer obviously or you wouldn't have an agent like Arthur Blake. - Well what if I can't do it the way you want? Do you know what I mean? - Well... - You deserve a great rewrite. - Okay if you can't you can't but I think you can. I really do. I mean... I showed that script to everybody I know and nobody saw what I did except you. Really. Come on, and it won't even take that long, you just make a few changes and you're the only one I trust to do it, I swear. Please do it. Please. Please! - You got me. - Yes? - I will do it. - Hey buddy, buddy. (snapping) Buddy, you got a cigarette? Cigaretto, cigaretto? - No, I don't smoke. - Can you spare a dollar? Dollar, please? - Yeah. - Thanks. - You doing alright? - Yeah, yeah. Thank you, thank you, thanks. Yeah, alright. - Good luck. - You going in there? - Yeah. - Yeah, best of luck. Lot of good they did me. Shit goes for a buck and a half. - Hey Vance, look man. How many times do I have to tell you? No hustling in front of the building. - Yeah you wouldn't be talking to me like that if I was still head of CCI's motion picture literary department! - Yeah but you're not. - You used to kiss my ass! - Right but you're a bum now, okay? - Chew 'em up, spit 'em out. (spitting) - Okay so take your Armani suit and your Lexus and get outta here! Okay, see ya Vance. (light music) - Morning Laura. - Morning. - Laura, I'm gonna drop these off and I'll be right out. - [Laura] Yeah, all good. - Hey, hey! (clapping) (phone ringing) - Good morning, Arthur Blake's office. Mm hmm. You're an actor, uh huh. Need an agent, uh huh. How unusual. Yeah. Oh absolutely, I'll give him the message, uh huh. Well of course I'm writing it down. - I've gotta drop these off at Arthur Blake's. - Well any scripts have to go through me first. - Okay well I gotta pick some stuff up there too so. - Well you're on the wrong floor. He's in the executive suite. - Executive suite, thanks. - Next time just drop it off at the receptionist. - You know what I just thought? I'm glad you called because you know what I realized we're casting a new film for Robert Redford and I think there's a part you'd be just perfect for. Uh huh, yeah. What's your number again? Oh yeah, mm hmm, I'm writing. Uh huh, still writing. (light music) (cries out) (rock music) Can I help you? Can I help you? - Yeah, I need to talk to Arthur Blake. - [Assistant] I'm Mr. Blake's assistant. What would you like to speak to him about? - Um, I need him to be my agent, just for a couple weeks. - Yes, I'm sure you do. But Mr. Blake is not taking new clients at this time. Perhaps if you tried one of the smaller agencies. - No, I need to talk to him right now. - Well, I'm afraid that's impossible. Mr. Blake is out of town. Good morning, Mr. Blake. - What's he doing down there? - [Assistant] It's the way he came in. - Mr. Blake, Mr. Blake, I need to talk to you right now. - Would you like me to call security? - Are you dangerous? - No. - Alright, who do you know? - Amanda Clark and Sidney Stone. - Good answer. You have five minutes. (light music) - I didn't misrepresent myself. I was the guy that got the joke, you know. And the last thing that she said was that Sidney Stone was gonna call this morning, and that's it. - So tell me something. Does this kinda thing happen to you frequently? - Absolutely not, no. I am an honest, you know, I'm a normal guy. I watch a lot of movies. - This is unusual, you know, if you wrote this down I could probably sell it as a feature. Can you write? - I took a class once and I'm not a very good speller. - [Arthur] Well the computers do that now. - Amanda said that I'd make a lot of money and you know I guess either way you can't lose. - Yes, but how much could they possibly give you for a rewrite? - [Harold] Well, I got the feeling it's whatever you decide. - Oh. Well I don't know, I mean I have a reputation. How do I know this is even true? - [Assistant] Mr. Blake, would you like to take a call from Sidney Stone? - Put her on hold. I gotta tell you I mean any other agent would think you were a crackpot and throw you right out of the office. Of course crackpots are selling a lot of million dollar scripts these days. And I don't know, there's something about you. Alright! Alright. But now let me tell you. If you want to write a screenplay there's certain things you have to learn. Now there's a bookstore where you can... Ah, forget all that. Do me a favor, go on home and just write. Sidney!

The Grim Reaper versus Ivan the Terrible, Ivan won. - No. - No it was terrific. It was the best ever. - Beat the Grim Reaper? - Yeah. - Beat death? - Yeah. - That's deep. Why didn't you call me? - You hate wrestling. Why are you doing this? - I got something for you. - What do you want? What a match, god it was good. That's a large chunk of money, what is this? - It's the advance for the rewrite. I want you to have it though. - You're giving me this damn check? - Yes, yes indeed. Bail the company out. - Your mother would be proud, Harold. And I thank you, I really thank you, that's terrific. So you got a deal? - Yeah, yeah. That's why I'm doing these writing exercises. - Well but we're talking about a professional screenplay here. - I know. - For muscles you do exercises, for brains-- - Yeah. - You gotta go to college. - We didn't have enough money for brains, did we Dad? So that's why I gotta do this. They're paying me a lot of money. And I owe it to Amanda to do a really good job. Learn as much as I can. - You and your mother, you're always dreamers, I... - But you know what we never did anything about it, Dad. A lot of dreaming. - But this is a whole other ballgame. Oh. Hey. Now that we got everything paid off and all we should think about expanding. - Expanding? - Yeah! With you and me both driving we could use a second trolley. It'll be like the old days, come on, it'll be fun. - No, Dad, what are you... Pay the bills off, don't double down, that's stupid. - No, you gotta-- - When you get your cast off you go home and I continue on with my life, okay? - Yeah but you gotta think big to be big. I try to teach you that. - I am thinking big, Dad! - No you're not. - Look at me with this. I'm stepping up for the first time in my life and you can't see that. - You're just screwy right now, it's that girl, ain't it? It's that movie star, am I right? - No, she has something to do with it but she sparked this whole thing for me. You can't see that. - That's it Harold. Look what's going on here. A dame like that eats guys like you for breakfast. Forget her. - You know what? We had a good time and I felt like a different person. Alright and you can't see that. - You felt like a different person. - Yeah. - Well let me give you a clue, Harold. You are not a different person. You are a tour bus driver like I am. You got it? We show folks movie stars' homes. We do not date them. - Alright. - I'm sorry, I sounded rude. Jesus. I got an idea. For forgetting your birthday let me give you a little surprise okay? - No, don't worry about it Dad. - No I wanna do this. - It's over! Birthday's over. - I wanna do this, please, just... Okay cook a big dinner tomorrow night, let me take care of the rest. - Alright, okay. - Okay. I love you, man. - There's a lot more if you guys want it. - [Dad] Come on Lulu, is this great food or what? - Potatoes are real good. - Thank you. - Oh so as I was saying. After I read his palm, I told him that he would lose weight and come down with a horrible disease. Six months later, he's dead. - What happened? - Car hit him. (laughing) - Oh you! You goof! I bought it. Oh don't let her fool you, she's got the gift. She told me... She told me I was gonna get a lot of money. Need I go any further? - Well you're a quiet one, aren't you? Still waters run deep. - No no, he's just got to get to know you first. Then watch out! - Mr. McMurphy you are bad, bad, bad! - Acts just like a lady, don't she Harold? - Only when I'm with such handsome gentlemen. Oh, you're blushing. He's blushing. I like a man with humidity. You're an Aries, aren't you? - No. - Libra? - Nope. Pisces. - Ah, Pisces! He's a Pisces. I was just gonna say that. Pisces! (giggling) - She's got it, she has the gift. Bingo, third try. You're so funny. - Oh this looks good. - Yeah? - Oh that's good, it's so very good. So he says to me, &quot;If you don't stop shaking those things &quot;in my face, I'm gonna kick you off the cheerleading squad.&quot; And then he took my pompoms. - He took your pompoms? - Yeah. - Doesn't look it to me. (laughing) - Mr. McMurphy I think you like to see me blush. - Oh, oh Harold. Help the old man up. I've had too much to drink. Oh oh oh oh oh. - You alright? - Yeah I'm alright. - Okay. - I'm fine. Lulu? - Yeah? - It was terrific. - Terrific. - I want you people to have some good times yourselves, okay? - You know I've got to wake up early Dad. - Hold it. Give me a second here. - Okay. - Okay. Keep everything down to a low roar. - Okay, yeah well okay so we're not gonna be here too long 'cause I've gotta get up. Gonna wake up. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - [Dad] Lulu. - I like your father, he's really nice. - Yeah, it's a good act. - Hope I'm not keeping you up. - Actually-- - Why don't you let me read your palm? I'll do it for free. I can tell you about your love life. I can read the future. - Oh, couldn't be a bigger fan of the unknown. - Oh, stop it you are not. Get over here, come on over here and sit by me. (laughing) You're not the sharpest tool in the shed, are you? Come sit by me, come on, inch your butt over here. Here he comes, ladies and gentlemen. Come on mister. Alright then. Did you have any of that wine? Damn that was good. Alright, let's see what we got here. Ooh, let me focus. Ooh, I see. Look at that. - What? - I see you recently met a woman who you like very much. - That is true. - Uh huh, yes it is. Aw, but you're afraid to tell her how you really feel. You see that? You're afraid that she might reject you. - Couldn't be more true, tell me more. - Well don't worry, she won't reject you. - No? - Nuh uh, she wants you equally. - That's true? - Yeah, she wants you right now. - What do you mean? - Get over here! (shouting) - [Harold] Oh no no Lulu don't! - [Lulu] I wanna wake up naked on your stove! - [Harold] Oh that's not right for me, Lulu! - [Lulu] Oh stop talking and kiss me. - [Harold] Oh my god, okay please, please. Lulu. Dad, Dad? Oh see, that's alright, that's okay. - Hey what's that, is that for me? - No, that's not for you honey. (laughing) Okay we gotta, I gotta take you very far away because you're really not right for me. I swear to you she tried to rape me. - Get outta here. (laughing) - No no no no no. Now the only reason I did not call the cops and I kid you not was because the sheer terror of them dusting my crotch for fingerprints. Otherwise I would have called the cops. - So what happened? Did she like actually force you to do it? - No no no, ultimately I ended up tying her up with a phone cord to make her stop. - She must have really hated that. - No she loved it, I think she thought it was kinky. - Oh, she sounds so right for me. - No no. - Oh come on man, hook me up. She can't be as freaky as Norma Desmond. - Twice as freaky. - The woman in the movie. Seriously? - Enjoy the movie. - [Harold] It almost goes by too fast, you know? That's what they say-- - [Danny] Words, words, and more words. - That's what they say art is man. When you can make 10 minutes seems like eight. It flew by. - Style of filmmaking, man. Tell them, the way the writer tells the story even though he's dead. - See what happens when you lie to a movie star? - What are you saying, she's gonna shoot you? - Well you know what? I wouldn't blame her if she did. - Have you called her? - Say what, you know? I'm a tour bus driver, that I'm not a writer. I don't even know what to say to her. - No man, just ask her out. Tell her you need to discuss the script. - Forget it man, no more lies. I'm not gonna lie to her anymore, that's what I'm trying to tell you. - Then tell her the truth, tell her you just wanna see her. - At least it wouldn't be a lie. - That's right, and you know technically you are a writer now. - Why, because I got paid? - You got paid. - So what? You know what, I haven't written anything. That's the reality. - I got it. I got it. - What? - I know just the place for you to take her. - Where? - My play! - Oh no. - Oh come on man, I'll get you in backstage, you'll be a bigshot! - It will be horrible, you'll explain the entire thing to her. You know? Be a joke. You would be slamming 8x10s right on her feet. You know what I will support you, I'll be there opening night I promise you. I'm gonna send her flowers. - Well that's original. God. (phone dialing) - Arthur Blake please. (phone ringing) - Good morning, Arthur Blake's office. - Hello, this is Amanda Clark calling and I was hoping you could help me reach a client of yours. Looking for Harold McMurphy? - Harold McMurphy. Oh yeah, the writer. Well Miss Clark, I'm sorry, I can't give out our client's numbers over the phone. I mean for one thing we have no way of verifying it's actually you. - Oh god, that's true, isn't it? Um, hmm. Well it really is me. Could you call my agent? - Miss Clark, it's not that I don't believe you but I mean how could I be sure? I mean how would you feel if some creep called your agency and said he was Mel Gibson? (laughing) - Well not a good example right? - Well actually I could get in touch with Mr. Blake in New York and call you back, is there a number where I could reach you? - Oh, yeah that would be great. I'm gonna be at the Beverly Hills Hotel this afternoon at a luncheon, maybe you could leave a message at the front desk. - No problem, I'll try to get in touch with Mr. Blake right away. And Miss Clark, I just love your movies. - Oh thanks, thanks for your help. Bye bye. (classical string music) (clapping) - Thank you very much, thank you everybody, thank you. Well let me be honest with you. I can never understand why we have to throw a banquet to raise money for starving people. (laughing) But let me just say this that the generous contributions you have made have already exceeded the calories you'll consume today. (laughing) So eat up and enjoy, thank you, thank you very much. (clapping) - Amanda. It's been such a long time, how are you? - Hi, good! - Gosh you look terrific. - Oh, thanks. You look great yourself, really. - Well you know me, I'm just an old tired fundraiser. (laughing) - You're doing a great job as always. - Well you know it keeps me out of trouble. Listen, I heard about you and Rich. - Rich who? - Okay so that's how it is. Alright, this is the question. - Yeah. - Are you looking and have you met anybody? - No, not really. Okay. I did meet someone interesting. - Really? - Yeah. But I'm not really sure what he thinks of me. - Oh come on, what, are you serious? Is he stupid, is he married, gay? - He's a writer. (scoffs) - He's probably all three. (laughing) - Actually I don't know that much about him yet but he sent me flowers. - Flowers, a romantic! That's a really good sign. - Oh thank you. - Oh yes, thank you. Thank you. Okay, I'll tell you what. Why don't you ask around? You know, these people know everything about everyone, or at least they think they do. So come on, I'll introduce you. - I don't wanna ask 'em. - Oh come on. Listen, I will pick their pockets and you pick their brains. (laughs) Let's go. Like a lot of flowers? - Oh yeah. - Is it McMurphy? I thought it was Murray. Anyway, yes, I remember him very well. He was always into trouble. Drank like a fish, ah! - His was a very famous case in purely psychoanalytical terms. He bears the classic symptoms of the Madonna/Whore complex. And by Madonna I'm speaking of the virgin. - He used to date my granddaughter the son of a bitch. He never even came into the house the son of a bitch. Wasn't even Jewish the son of a bitch. - Yeah, Harold McMurphy. Wasn't he the guy, the writer that was caught plagiarizing Paddy Chayefsky? Always had a couple of girls on the side too. - Uh Miss Clark, message for you. - I remember him. - Could you excuse me a minute? - Yes. - Thank you. - No problem honey. - 12 cancellations. Isn't that beautiful. (sighs) (phone ringing) Trolleywood. Trolleywood Tours, hello? - Hello, can-- (static buzzing) - Hello? - Can you hear me? Hello? - Hello? (phone dialing) (phone ringing) Yeah? Trolleywood for pete sakes. - [Amanda] Is Harold there? - What, is that you Lulu? Hey, could you speak up? I can hardly hear you. - I'd like to speak to Harold if I may. - No, he's not here right now. But he oughta be back pretty soon. - [Amanda] I haven't heard from him since the other night, I was just wondering how he's doing. - Yeah well I'll tell you how he is. He's a jerk. I mean, hate to say it but I think you're wasting your time. I'm beginning to think he doesn't like real women at all. You know, all he likes is those Hollywood floozies. - Are you sure we're talking about the same Harold? - Yeah, I know it's hard to believe and I've known him a lot of years. Listen, I tried to get him to call you, he wouldn't do it. If you want I'll try again but I don't think it's gonna do any good. - No, that's okay. If he didn't want to call, no. - Listen, I am so sorry, I think it's a shame myself. But hey, forget him, you know? Do yourself a favor and get on with your life. - Yes, I will, alright, thank you. Wait, who is this? - Poor kid. - Hello? God! (gentle music) - Look who's here! Can I get you something, drink, pedicure? - No thanks, I'm fine. - Amanda if you were fine you wouldn't be hanging around in a party dress at three o'clock in the afternoon. What's wrong? - Sid, I need to talk to you. - Sidney sweetheart we gotta get this out, you're gonna oxidize here. - Atilla give me two minutes. - Okay, let me just get this one here. - Okay. Okay so tell me what happened. - Okay it's about Harold. You know the writer. I just, I dunno Sid, I think I might have been really wrong about him. - Well he's a writer honey, you know how writers are. - Yeah but I thought he was this sweet sorta innocent man and now I find out from somebody that apparently knows him really well he's a real jerk. Sid I should have found out more about him. - I never trusted him. He was too, what do you call it, too evasive. But you know there are a lot of people who would be a whole lot happier if this rewrite deal fell through. - I'm starting to lose my faith in people. In men. - You have to protect yourself Amanda, things are different now. When you're hot, everybody has their own agenda. - It shouldn't have to be that way. - That's showbiz, honey. (honking) - Hey. - Hey. - [Dad] How was the run? - It was alright. We made up for some stuff. - You'll never guess who called. - [Harold] Who? - Lulu. She was so torn up because you hadn't talked to her. - Dad, I don't wanna-- - Point that she-- - I may sue Lulu, okay, don't talk about her please. - Don't worry, I let her down easy. So what's going on? - Well I think I'm gonna go try writing. You know everyone thinks I'm a writer I might as well try it. - Okay so what you're saying is you're gonna write the damn thing. - Yeah. Well you know saying it's one thing and doing it is another. - Alright don't be so stressful about it. You know what you gotta do. You gotta get yourself drunk. - That's gonna solve my problems Dad, getting drunk? Come on. - No I'm serious Harold. I never heard of a writer that didn't drink. There was Hemmingway, what a drunk he was. That guy O'Neill? - Yeah. - Seriously, just have a cocktail. Harold, it's not a big deal, it loosens up all your phagocytes. - I don't know what that means, but... You think that would help? - If there was one place in life I failed you, it was there. I shoulda taught you how to drink. Just give it a try. - Okay. Well. I'll think about it Dad. - Alright, go slow. - Alright. (upbeat rock music) - Love you. - Harold! (shouts) - Wow. - Wake up man. - Why are you yelling? That's so wrong. - Are you okay? - Yeah, look, how do I feel? - You look like a hundred bucks. - I'm much, I'm... - You know, I have never seen anyone get drunk so fast on one drink. You're gonna hurt yourself. Stop. - Please get off the babysitter. (laughing) Please, your mother and I are very, very, very proud of you. - You need to ease up brother if you want a ride home 'cause I still got a couple more hours to work. - Danny Danny Danny Danny! - Oh my fan club, hey! - Handsome man! - Where you guys been, I missed you. - We missed you too. We had an audition with a casting director we know. - Both of you? - He's into group sex. - [Harold] Casting a crowd scene? (laughing) - This is my good friend Harold McMurphy and he is a fabulous writer. - Mm, really? - Yes. - Would I know your work? - Are you rich? - Um, well you know I'm in training actually. - Oh. - Yes, I'm in training. You guys smell good. - Thank you. - Don't take that the wrong way. - So do you. - Oh thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. You know I'm having fun. Danny this is good, I'm living the dream, right? I'd like to buy you guys a drink. - Oh. - Sure! - I'm in, sure. - Alright. You know, I'd like to buy everyone a drink. I always wanted to say that. I want to buy everyone a drink. Danny, I wanna buy those people a drink right behind me, I wanna buy these people a drink. Danny, take me seriously. Take me seriously! - I'm taking you seriously. - I wanna buy these people, I wanna buy... Sidney! I know them. Sidney! Harold McMurphy. (laughing) She heard me. You're gonna like her, she's weird. - Harold. - Hey. - What a surprise. - Yeah. - I was just talking about you. - Just now? - No, earlier. - Oh. - How are you? - I'm... - You look like you're doing just fine. - Yeah. - Oh! - Sorry, sorry. I'm a little drunk. - Good, good. Let me get you something. - Oh. - Would you and your friends like some champagne? - I would-- - Bartender. I'd like a bottle of your best domestic champagne for my good friend Harold and his lovely... - This is my friend Tori. - Hi, Carrie. - Carrie. - I'm Tori. - Companions. Put it on my tab. - Wow, that's very nice of you, thank you. - My pleasure. So good to see you like this. - Thank you. - But I gotta run. - You gotta... - Enjoy! - You don't wanna have a quick drink? Hey Sidney, will you tell Amanda that I said hello? - Oh, believe me I will. - Okay. What a good guy. Good guy. - Yeah, I think you oughta get down here. There's something here I think you should see. Just trust me. (laughing) - Oh hey! (bluesy music) (groaning) (laughing) - Harold, what do you write with? - I write with, I write with my typewriter-- - Okay. - And my big pen. - What? - Your big pen? - A big what? - Um... (laughing) - Harold says he has a big pen. - No my Bic pen, I have a Bic pen. That's what I write with. Come on girls. - Doesn't look that Bic to me. - Hey! (laughing) Come on now, you know. - Harold. Harold. Harold. - What, what? Hey, hey Amanda. How you doing? Hey. Amanda. - You know her? - Yeah. Amanda! Hold on a second, wait a minute. Amanda, what's going on? Hey, what are you doing? What's wrong? I'm confused. Are you okay? - I'm fine. - You're okay? - I'm fine. - I'm very happy to see you, I don't know-- - You're drunk, okay? - I'm a little drunk but-- - Yeah, if you wanted to see me that badly Harold-- - Why are you upset? - You could have called me, okay? - You wanted me to call you? I would have called you. I would do anything to call you. - You know that's really, it's quite an act you put on. - What? - Really. I mean you deserve an award for making me think you were different but I can see that you're like every other slimebucket in this town. - That's not what-- - You're just like all of 'em, Harold! - No, hold on, why, because those girls? Look I don't remember their names, I just met them tonight! - Harold that even makes it worse! The least you could do is remember their names, treat them like human beings. Next thing I know you're gonna tell me they lured you here and made you get drunk! - No I meant to get drunk, I came here to get drunk. - Oh you're disgusting. - No no hold on! Hold on a second! I got drunk because I wanted to show you that I can write. Okay, give me a chance to show you that I can write. - Don't bother. - Why? - Look, I don't need you to write any more of your sexist crap, okay? Really, just go back to your little girlfriends and leave me alone. - Amanda, wait a minute, where are you going? Amanda, listen to me, don't leave. Amanda, you want me to tell you the truth? No no listen to me! No no you don't understand! I'm not, Amanda, I'm not a writer I'm a tour bus driver! I'm just a tour bus driver. (door slams) - [Dad] I mean did you at least gas the bus for tomorrow? - Dad, I told you I gotta work until it's done. Okay, please. - What are you saying, you're not gonna do anything else? - No. - I'm supposed to do everything around here? - No I'll do it, I'll tell you what. I will make the dinner and I'll drive the trolley but that's it, please Dad. - Excuse me Harold, you know what? I don't get it. What is the point in knocking yourself out? You got a D in spelling twice. - That doesn't matter! - Alright well-- - It doesn't matter! - What I mean is there's a lot of writers out there with more experience than you! It's one thing to say you're a hotshot writer and it's another thing to think that you really believe it! - I don't have time to explain all that to you, okay? Maybe you're right, maybe I'm not a writer. I know a good story and I know movies, it's all in my head. If I can get it down on paper then I can do something! - Alright. But try not to type too loud.

Don't worry about breakfast, I had something delivered. And don't drink out of the carton. - I'm not. Finished the rewrite. - You finished the screenplay? - Yep. - No kidding. You finished early, I thought you had a couple more days to go. - So did I. Apparently I didn't. - So, what do you think? Is it worth anything? - I don't know. I don't think so. - When do you find out? - Don't think I'm going to, I just talked to her. She doesn't ever want to see me again. - Doesn't want to see you again? Why not? You have a deal. - Yeah that's what I thought so too but apparently she found out about me. She kept talking about me and my preoccupation for Hollywood floozies. What does that mean, floozies? No one uses that word anymore. I gotta get outta here. I got a trolley to drive. - Jesus. - We have the same map. - Welcome to Trolleywood Tours, can I take your tickets please? - Oh oh. Do you think we'll see a movie star? - No, absolutely not, no way. - What? Well that's not what the fellow at the station said.

You remember Gloria from the film Sunset Boulevard. She played the actress who shoots the lying, no good writer William Holt in the back. Just remember, you should always tell the truth, 'cause if you don't you get exactly what you deserve. (gentle music) You can't pretend to be somebody else 'cause you're just gonna hurt someone. And just 'cause she's a movie star doesn't mean that she doesn't have feelings. Probably got deeper feelings than you'll ever know. She's a real person. Not made of wax. Forget about being preoccupied with movie stars, they're just people. They're your neighbor, they're your best friend, they're somebody you know. Deal with your own life, your own integrity. Never give it away. Tell the truth and run. Tell the truth and stay! - I bet you he's in love. I bet he is, he's kind of a handsome young man. - I'm not saying that movies are bad. Movies, they're great, they serve an amazing purpose. They tell a great story, can tell you a lot about your life. What you're doing wrong. (honking) - Hey, there's Rich Adams! - What, where? - What? - You! (upbeat music) - What you gotta do to make things right? (bell dings) Hang on everybody. - Hey, could you get out of the way? What?

In fact he's still here. - My father's in your house? - No actually he's in the pool. - Oh my god, want me to, I'll get him out. - No, it's fine. Harold, that's not why I'm upset. - Is it become of the money? I'll find a way to get it back to you, I promise. - No, it's not about the money, it's about the screenplay. I read it. (gentle music) - You read my screenplay. - Mm hmm. And there's one question I have to ask you. What makes you think you're qualified to write a love scene? I mean when was the last time you were in love? - Actually a lot more recent than you think. - Yes well I certainly couldn't tell from the scene in the woods, I mean, here they are in the middle of nowhere, she's just come back to save his life, and all you can have him do is reach out and shake her hand? - Well, family picture. - Oh Harold, for goodness sakes, it's the 1990s. I mean it's sweet and all but it's a little naive, don't you think? - Well I liked it when I wrote it. - Okay you liked it but did you believe it? - Yeah, I believed it. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Well Harold, if you were there with that woman and she had just saved your life, wouldn't you at least wipe the dust off of her cheek? Hmm? Wouldn't you take your arms and wrap 'em around her waist and pull her close? Wouldn't you look into her eyes and tell her how you felt? Hmm? (music swells) (cheering and clapping) - Bravo! I told you he was in love! (laughing) - I'm sorry, I'm sorry about that. Did you like it? My screenplay did you like my screenplay? - Oh Harold, it was, it was just right. - Really? - Yeah! It was so good, I love it! - Yay! (light music) - Miss Clark may I have your autograph? - Yes, sure. - Make it to George. - Okay. - No no no you guys! I'm sorry, I'm sorry about this. - It's okay. - Please? This is just like a real movie. - Okay, get back on the bus everybody. This is not part of the tour. Isn't part of the tour. - Harold! She's got marble toilets, honest to god. - Dad, don't touch anything. For me. - You got good taste. The chandeliers, the whole place is like slippery, it's wonderful. Oh hello.
