It's almost used up. Won't you buy another? ENTRANCE 2 They're for T-Bear's kids. Let's go eat pizza. I'll take you home. I'm sick of pizza too. Let's go have couscous. Philippe, stop avoiding it. You have to tell her anyway. I know… And I haven't seen my son in four days… -Evening. -Evening. Are the kids asleep? We have to wake up at six. We can't go anymore. The fucking judge summoned me. If it wasn't her, it'd have been something else. Here's your train ticket. Come if you feel like it. Look at this, goddammit! She's charging me! I'll go to jail! Understand? I don't care. MY BELOVED SON OUR COLLEAGUE OUR FATHER CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DEPT. Claudine? Did you all cry your eyes out? -No school today? -I left early. I'm tired. The less my kids see me, the better off they are. Same goes for me. Cut that out. Gérard, at least I know I'm useless. Mom? You're here, Dad! How did it go today? Yeah, no problem. Are you sure? Except for math. I don't get it. All right. Get your books. We'll take a look. Too bad his math test was this morning. Hi, Fanny. -Hey, Gérard. -Hi, Francis. Give me Philippe's stamp back. -Can I keep it? -Come sign for it. Hey guys. And gals! Pardon me. The judge is sorry about Philippe, but she won't let up. She summoned you next Thursday as squad leader. Finish with this once and for all. She's sorry, but Philippe's death wasn't enough. Wasn't today the day of his summons? Yes. Let's go, Francis. And get her more worked up? We have to go. For Philippe's sake. Excuse me. It's today, right now, that Philippe Maurin… … was summoned for a hearing. You came instead so I'd feel guilty about his death. I understand. I really do, believe me. But do people commit suicide over a summons? Especially when they're innocent? You know full well what I'm after. The same old thing: T-Bear's real name and address. He's implicated as a dealer in many of my cases. None of us knows. How dumb do I look? At least Philippe Maurin admitted that T-Bear was your squad's main informer. Your "cousin" as you say. But good cops don't rat on their rats. So good cops protect criminals. Isn't that so? No, Your Honor. We'd rat on him, but Philippe dealt with T-Bear alone. Only he knew who he was and where he lives. Now that Philippe's dead… Be very careful. I warned him, now I'll warn you: protect T-Bear and I'll slap you all with aiding and abetting. I'll be interrogating you on Thursday. Not me. You summoned the squad leader. That's him. Shit! Great fucking system! You know to knock. Are you alone? No, I'm with Chirac and his wife. It's just Gérard. Hi, Nathalie. Ever ready! Relying on a bucket, what a life! Give Gérard a kiss. Hi there, Émilie. Hi, Soraya. Set another place. -Presents! -Great! This is yours. How did you know we wanted them? -Philippe bought them. -We'll make him a drawing. You have his new address? Gérard will send it. What's this? It's mine. Sit back down. Finish your yogurts. How's school? I put them in Catholic school. Forget public school. No veils allowed? I don't give a fuck about veils! Public school is dangerous now. Dealers all over! They're better off with priests. But it costs a bundle. I'm working overtime. Don't go overboard. Nathalie… It's bedtime. Goodnight, Soraya. Thanks, Gérard. I can't get over it. Philippe was such a happy guy! It's that wife. I told him to dump her. Did he mention his summons? That wasn't it. He didn't care. The judge is bluffing. She's not, T-Bear. She'll go all the way. What a load of crap! Now that Philippe's dead… Hear about the hold-ups? Sort of. Not interested? Others will be. What do you know? Saturday. Two guys. I don't know where, but they're coming here before they hit. Saturday? How do you know? I'm selling them the gun. No way. Like this, they have to stop by before they hit. No ammo, then. Obviously. I have to go. My clients don't wait. Same old small-time crap, what a life! If you're late, the competition moves in. Same old pouch. You got a better idea? "Officer, it's not mine!" "I was taking it to the police. I'm clean!" Off to work! Mrs. Ducreux! Titine! How's my little Titine? Did your wife tell you about my pension next week? Thursday! I'll go with you to get it. Thank you. Good night! Good night, ma'am. -I'll call about the hold-ups. -Call late. I'm not sure yet. Really? Philippe was never wishy-washy. He was some guy! MY SEMIFINALS ARE SATURDAY AT 2 P.M. BE THERE AT 1:30. Shit! Lastly, They hit a gas station at 9 p.m. They shot and wounded the attendant. Eleven armed robberies in two months. Not bad. Look. You already got me in trouble with the judge. With no drugs involved, she'll never know. No one will know our source. Philippe tipped me off. -T-Bear confirmed it. -Who? Never heard of him. Now that Philippe's dead, does anyone here know T-Bear? I do. He's my cousin now. You should see Soraya dance now. She's a natural! More expenses! You break my heart. I got money to burn! Did Philippe tell you? I get welfare now. Come on, come on. Hold your horses! One of them just arrived. I'm cutting off. You're so goddamn paranoid! Scared I'll bring the cops? You owe me for five grams. Five and two makes seven. I'm talking to you! Now you owe me 6,000. Relax. In an hour, we'll have 60,000. An hour, not tomorrow. Or I'll pay your parents a visit. Give me that and I'm on my way. -No bullets? -Nope. You don't need them. What the fuck? Stick this up your ass! Shut up! No one shouts here! Stop it! No one shouts here! You hear me? No one shouts here! Don't ever do it again! Say you won't! Say it! I won't. Just stop! I'll get the paper towels. Wipe your face. You're all cut. Thanks, T-Bear. Take it or leave it. I can't, T-Bear. No bullets, no deal. You have some here. Wipe it all off. It's too hairy. Everyone's armed now. No bullets, no deal. Sorry, I only have three. Now get lost. I'll be waiting for my money. One hour. Here he comes. White, about 25, red and gray jacket, bloody left cheek. Thanks for the door… And the bullets! What an ingrate! What else? I saved the show! What a life… Mrs. Ducreux, were we too noisy? We had some friends over. Thank you! He took a left. I'll go see. He got in a red car. At the corner. Someone else is driving. We'll take your place. We'll say when. Fanny, Michel, stay put until they pull out. Here they come. Straight towards us. Idiots! -Shooting up and driving. -I got them. They're heading toward Montfermeil in a red Honda Civic. License plate in 93. There are two of them. If he sold them good smack, they'll be going ape-shit! The café! It's good. No one move! Shut up! Shut up and stand still! Shit! Move it! The money, now! The money, bitch! A gun wasn't enough? Ammo too? Fuck him. There are lots of good cousins. As good as T-Bear? Name one. Look at Slick and his chick. Your money or your life! Hand it over! I'll waste her! Step on it, bitch! I'll kill them! -Bastard! -Shut up! What's that asshole doing? If the cops come, it'll be a bloodbath. Make it fast or you're next! They're in danger! That's why we're here. Get going now. Hello, police? Listen… Who is this bitch? And you let her? Give it back! Damn it. What are you doing? Faster! Move! Move in. Fuck this! Here they come! My phone… Let them cool off. Jeannot, lead the way. We're in place. I'll say when. Go! Move it, old man! Police! Police, don't move! Hands in the windshield! Don't move! -Eyes on me! -Eyes on him! Don't move. Eyes on me. Don't move! Ouch! This dumb ass just shit in his pants. All right… -Cheers. -Cheers. Well done! I just told the director. They were getting dangerous. Good work, Delvaux. Congratulate Philippe. Philippe Maurin? It was his cousin? Here, Chief. -Have a drink. -I'm not thirsty. And I'm late. How about three stars? Sounds good to me. OK. -How much? -Four hundred, without wine. Four hundred? Thank God we don't nab many gunmen. Leave some for the other rats. Right… With their two-bit tips? Gérard, tell them what you said to the judge. "It's not me, Your Honor. It's him." I'll have a ball with her. You better be good. She's a real big shot. Cute, too. You should go for it! She's married with kids. -So what? -Shit! He lost. His team was eliminated. -Put him on. -No. He's asleep now. He waited for you until 11. He needed to talk. It's too late now. You're asleep? I don't like bums! I have a reputation! You want a drink? Plastered, too. How pathetic… That's all? That's all I get? -That's all I have. -Bullshit. They owed me 6,000. I advanced them 6,000! I get nothing from the hold-up? My head hurts. So does mine! A real lot! This isn't working. They wanted to drop you. At least we still use you. That won't feed the kids. Philippe would never have done this! I just want my 6,000 francs. First find me a nice drug bust. Keep it down. You'll wake the kids. You're right. She's right. Stow it! Nathalie and her nightie get my juices flowing. What did you say? That's a shame. Philippe must have told you how important family is to me. You must have misunderstood. Let me explain. Sorry, my mistake. You get my juices flowing! What an idiot! Move over. Mom told me about the game. It's no big deal. I don't care anyway. What do you mean? I'm giving up basketball. No way. You have to try harder. Sport is just like life. You get out what you put in. You have to fight. Thanks for yesterday. We pushed pencils all day. Sorry, I overslept. Funny how that happens on Sundays. I got too plastered. It's T-Bear. What is it? No, I'm having lunch with my wife. Okay, come for coffee. You know the China Palace? You're done? It wasn't good? Yeah, there was too much of it. Is that who you're expecting? Claudine, my wife. T-Bear. Nice to meet you. Sit down. No, I won't bother you. Excuse me, it's not you. You prefer to be alone. Go outside. I'll have my coffee. Goodbye, Mr. T-Bear. Thanks. It was a real pleasure. Goodbye. An apartment bust. They're Tamil wholesalers. Great stuff! I could only afford 30 grams. Bust them now! Relax… I saw 800 grams! It's going fast! Go this afternoon! -Today? -Yes. No way. You're saying no? It's the squad. They spent all weekend doing paperwork. What a life! It's time you paper shufflers retired. It's three. At four we move. At six you've got your 800 grams. Eight hundred grams! Come on! You're not the cop… And I'm not the leader! Not until tomorrow. Period. Philippe was different. In an hour, everyone was mobilized. Let up on Philippe. Call me tomorrow. Gérard. Your wife's something special. Watch out. It's not my problem, but does she drink too much? Forget it… I'm dumb. My mistake. But she's a real queen. We have a day to ourselves. Let's catch a movie. I'll buy groceries tomorrow. Yes. Hurry! There's a client leaving. -Hear that? -We're off. There's 300 on the table. The rest must be next door. Wait for another one to leave. It's every ten minutes, like the bus. Show me what you got. Careful. Brown smack. That's him! The guy just left. It's in his left hand. We'll take care of him. A taxi's pulling up. What did I say? Like the goddamn bus! That bitch! It's Miss England! Who? An old client of mine who screwed me over for 50 grams. Bust her ass good. Justice must be done! He has 20 grams on him. Green light. Let's bust them! Police! Get down! Nono! That door! Out! Fuck! Gérard. Fifty on Miss England, twenty in the mattress, plus fifty he blew away, and I'm being generous. That's 120. Not the 300 T-Bear promised. He jerked you off to eliminate his competition. Let's just wait. It was no use waking me up. How can he work in this mess? It's for next door. They sent the smack flying in here. Come here! Heel, come one! He sniffed out two spots, but it's all gone. You go. If I see him, he's dead. There were 300 grams! I saw it myself! Your dog sucks. You don't know how to look. You missed it. That pisses me off! Let me find it. Stay put! You all fuck up then call me a liar! What's in it for me? I'm stuck in here all night! Give me my ten percent. Not now. Tomorrow. What do I sell tonight? I'm all out. You're a loser. I call it quits. Plenty of squads want to use me! Who do you think you are? There are plenty of cousins too. Cousins like me? You think so? If it weren't for Philippe, you'd never have met me. Damn it! Wait right here. Thank T-Bear for us. He reeled us in real good. That's a hefty ten percent! I guess you're right, if you add sales tax and shit… You sell balloons at the Eiffel Tower. Explain the 32,000 francs you had on you. Translate. He only sells balloons. He doesn't make them. The money. Where does it come from? His balloons are very expensive! Yes? It's Fulvio. Can you come? It's important. Coming. He was 17. His little sister watched him OD. Get the picture? At least we nabbed the dealer. With 40 grams on him. He claims his supplier was T-Bear. This afternoon it goes before Judge Lambert. Can I question him? A gray duffel coat with a hood. Sort of small, a little pudgy. Dark hair. A beat-up car. You see the make? No. It definitely wasn't French. You bought 50. Did he have more? He had at least 300. All of it brown. He wanted me to buy all of it. Take the girls and go. Let's go take a walk, girls. You got dope to dump? I thought you were all out. You're right. I am all out. How stupid of me. I even forget to tell Nathalie. What a dummy! Come here. You have at least 300! Who's the dummy? Me? You? Never! What about this? Where did it come from? Don't spill it! I asked where it came from! You saw. The bathroom. That was my mother's! There goes 3,000 francs! Where? Six thousand! You know where it comes from! The Tamils! Where else? It was Philippe's thing! What was? You didn't know? How could I know he never told you. After all those years! Spit it out! He made sure anything off the premises wasn't seized. I'd go get it after. And then? And then… then I sold it. And then? What's wrong? We'd share the take. The Tamils hid it one floor up. I found 400. You get your half, like Philippe. You're lying. This time, I'll turn you in. And I'll keep this. I'll turn Philippe in too. -Philippe's dead. -Not his honor. Not his kids, not his mom. And not in your head. -It's the judge. -Yes, Your Honor. I'm sure you understood. She's summoned all of us now. We have nothing else to do. Can we go now, Fanny? You're late. Why did you bother coming? See you tomorrow. Still thinking of Philippe? You want one? No, thanks. Are you sure? Something else instead? No. -Just one. -I said no! I just want to sleep. "Like my colleagues, I know neither the identity nor the whereabouts of T-Bear." Did we get that down right? You did, Your Honor. Nothing to add? None of you? You're well-rehearsed. No, but it's like I said: only Philippe knew him. Of course. Given T-Bear's recent behavior, I've seen the district attorney. He's backing me on this: you have a week to turn him over. Otherwise, I'll nail you all for aiding and abetting. Article 434 of the penal code. And I'll bust you for peddling too. Don't look so stunned. I'm sure he gets the usual ten percent. Excuse me, but… What was T-Bear's recent behavior? We haven't heard. Very funny, Mr. Delaroche. Imagine just how funny it is. You come home, you go into the kids' room and there's your daughter clutching her dead brother. The parents are waiting outside. Tell them how you protect the supplier. Their son may even have died with your ten percent. Sign here. You knew? I'll drop him. Give me three days. T-Bear, be a good guy. Help us out. -I'll pay later! -Am I the Good Samaritan? Fuck off, then. I'll hold up an old lady. I hope it'll be your mother! -Fuck off! -You're dead! Asshole! Kill him! Stop it! Stop! Come out! Come out from there! Who are you gonna kill? Find the money. I'll be back. It was self-defense. Still going to rat on Philippe? It's up to you. Not anymore. Since that kid died, they want to drop you. Seriously? Fuck me… Just let them try. Whose dope killed him? It could be your ten percent! That's how it's always worked. We're in the same boat. You think I won't blab about everything? Tell Francis and the others: if they drop me, they all fall. You too! It's your call. Or else I can turn you in. But not for three days. We'll prepare things and get your family in safekeeping. It's your choice. What a life… You really want to nab these kids? Two arrests is two arrests. Yeah, right. For scooter theft? Come here, don't move! Bitch! You're a bunch of assholes! -Fucking cops! -Watch out. You can't sleep? Is something wrong? You have to stop. Stop what? I found the bottle under the sink. How long has it been? -Answer me. Say something. -Like what? You're never here, and when you are, you don't see a thing. You never heard Philippe crying for help. Claudine, I need you. Department for illegal aliens. Yes, sir. Five arrests. I like that. Things have been slow. We can bring in aliens by the busload. Just more paperwork. What do I care? I want high turnover. High turnover and low fuss. -Yes. -Gérard? -I'm in a phone booth. -The number? -Why now? -Just come. And take Baby Sub. I love Baby Sub. She's my favorite. Easy to drive, responsive. Comfy cozy, isn't it? We're being tailed? -It could be Internal Affairs. -No kidding. The judge wants our heads. When she realized we'd warned you, she went bananas. I noticed. Nathalie said our place was ransacked. She was called in three times. The kids will be next! My lawyer stopped it. After the kids, my mom! I got Ardouin. He's good, but fucking expensive! Especially now, with hotels and eating out. I'm broke. You know Ardouin? -Now where? -The Foch parking lot. -See the driver? -Yes. Calm down. A huge dealer. Bars and nightclubs, the works. The girl? His wife. Here come the niggers. High class. -Who are they? -Just wait… Enjoy the show. Isn't it great? Hold me back, Gérard. He's got two kilos there. Two kilos? Couldn't you have told me? Relax! Dumb schmuck! Why-- What's two kilos? Did you see the niggers? They have ten, fifteen, maybe twenty! How about a couscous? I'm giving you those Black guys skewered and on a platter. The 4X4 faggy tipped me. I've been smooth-talking them. It's almost in the bag. More wine? Another hundred grams, they'll deliver by the kilo where and when I want. Pretty damn tasty. Four hundred a gram if I buy a hundred grams. So? Find 40,000 francs and make drug-bust history. What's wrong? What are your slush funds for? Gérard! Wait up! Twenty kilos, imagine! We're talking 14 million francs street value! This was Philippe's big dream! He must be furious up there! Lay the hell off Philippe. You really can't find 40,000 francs? I can't ask. The squad won't work with you. Just get lost, then. Room 12 if you change your mind. I hear from the Black guys tomorrow. Stop manhandling me! I didn't steal his wallet. He left it in the room. Great case. A night of paperwork. There are no small cases. A hundred and ten francs is chicken shit! -I'll say… -Who asked you? Relax… I can help you. I hear things in hotels. I'm listening. It's Gérard! Hello, Gérard. Goodbye, Gérard. It's me. I found a new squad. Good for you. I was kidding. You can't go. Look at me. I'm pitiful, even to myself. My head hurts from thinking of Nathalie and the kids. I can't sleep here. It's too noisy. Too many Arabs. What? Salaam aleikum, brother. Aleikum salaam, asshole. Come. -Did your Black guys call? -Did you get the money? No. Remember this? Do I ever! Hold your horses. When they call, say I just arrived and I buy big. Now we wait… together. Happy, sweetheart? Bye! Bye. -Can I keep the car? -If you drop me off. And if you wash the glasses. Always an excuse… You're searching his stuff? I'm scared Gérard may do something stupid. What were you looking for? Goodbye now. I'm going to bed. Goodnight, Mom. Sleep well, honey. Thanks, mom. Can we go back to the phone booth? I forgot to kiss Daddy goodnight. Not tonight. It's too late. Tomorrow morning, on the way to school. Yes? Is it still on? Yes, with a buyer who's passing through. He buys by the kilo. Is he reliable? Number one in Clermont-Ferrand! -Clermont-Ferrand? -And the vicinity. Including Perigord. He's a big shot. He'll want a sampler. Can you reach him? Can I reach him? Sure I can! He's right here. Hold on. I'm Jean-Pierre. I'll start with 100. It's 500 a gram. In one hour. Four hundred or fuck off. And I'm busy in an hour. Midnight then. Or is that too late for a country boy? Midnight's fine. -You know the Ebony Club? -No. Come with him. He knows it. We have two hours. Do we have 40,000 here? Much more! We're in a rush. You can sell it half price. Four thousand five hundred. That makes 28,000. We have 45 minutes to make 12,000. This is no way to work. You got them horny. At this price, I'm Santa Claus. And Daddy Sub is your sleigh. Cough it up. Eight thousand. Those girls talk. I'll get killed for undercutting. Forty two thousand. We have 2,000 francs extra. Jean-Pierre, meet Mister… Bingo! N'Bongo! Not Bingo. N'Bongo. And… And his friends. You got what I wanted? Colder. It's cold enough for me. If it's good, I'll take a kilo tomorrow. And five kilos next week. If you can keep up with me. You've introduced me to a very good client. What did he say? That as middleman, you're responsible. Yes! Don't worry. Jean-Pierre is serious. He did ten years in prison! That's where we met. -In Clermont-Ferrand? -No. Poissy. Sector F. Second floor. My cellmate! Why Clermont-Ferrand? I'm persona non grata here. He wouldn't be here if it wasn't to buy big. What's the best club? In Clermont, obviously. Obviously. In Clermont… Let's go. Too many fucking questions! Buy yourself a guidebook! Look at him! Arabs have such fiery tempers. It's so exhausting. We Africans are always cool. Be like us. Sit down. Let's drink to business. You have the money? May I? Follow my friends. Not you. Stay with me, T-Bear. Relax. You're so nervous, it's scary. It's your funk music! It drives me wild! Careful, brother. We don't like rats or cheats. Still with us? You bet. Meet your friend out front. I'm sorry. We just want a drink. Yes… You need a tie. -And him? He doesn't have one! -He's a regular. Still… What don't I have? Calm down! Stop it! Let's try karaoke! Listen to your bitch! Move along. You don't have one! Right? That idiot insulted me after we licked those niggers' asses! Stop calling them niggers. You sound like Philippe. You know how I'd answer him? I'd say: "Look me in the eyes. Look hard." "I live in the jungle. I trash no one. My words are just words." Did you get the dope? Let's see! Scream it even louder. You went over big with Bingo. He didn't know what hit him! Thanks for Clermont. Keep complaining. I even set it up for tomorrow. We meet at a porno theater. They want the 300,000 up front. They'll go home and get the dope! They want you there? Obviously. We don't really have a choice. It's no go. Why? We're a great team! Cut the crap. You know the squad won't play along. I have an idea. But it won't be easy. What is it? Tell me! Come on! No. And I don't want you coming tomorrow. Did you hear me? Can I have what we bought? You'll get your ten percent. Nothing beforehand. The extra 2,000. Two thousand francs. Not even a term of school. I miss my girls bad. Without my family, I'm nothing. Without them, I'm lost. I mean it. I'm hungry… Aren't you? It won't take long. They won't wait. When I don't show, they'll go home. All we do is tail them. When do we take position? I heard from Belgium. Their license plates are fakes. Can we know who tipped you off? Remember Prince, from three years ago? He just got out. What? Prince, that lounge lizard? He's full of shit. Where did he see 15 kilos? Why not 30? Kilos… He must mean grams. He may be full of shit, but he helped me get this. You scored without telling us… Whose money? -That's my business. -It's ours too! What's going on? You come and go without a word! You took the sub without saying why. Careful, I hear rumors. You know this place. I prefer to tell you straight out. If you fuck up, you go down alone! Say it, Francis. Tell me I'm a dealer now! After ten years together, how can you accuse me? No wonder Philippe blew his brains out! You helped pull the trigger! You can't say that! See? See how easy it is to accuse? It's almost 11. Whoever's in, take position at 5 p.m. They left the theater. It's working. They're pissed off. I can see them. They're heading for the BMW. There they go. You're on, Jeannot. I hear you. They tore off! They ran the light. I'm stuck. I'm behind them. They took a right. I'll hang back. Go, Fanny. Shit. They turned again. Hang back. I'll go. I lost them. Jeannot, I'll move in. You go west. I combed every street: nothing. They're good. How stupid. There should have been six of us. Damn it! I got them. They're right beside me. Head west! You read me? They're going too fast! I can't keep up! Neither can I. We'll stop at the toll booth. I just passed them! They pulled over in the emergency lane! I see them. I can't stop. Fanny, pull over before exit 15. I'm in position. I can't see. They're hidden behind a fence. Half an hour! You think they broke down? It's fishy. Fanny, go see what they're up to. Gone. They backed up the exit. Fuck… Fuck! Peace, brother. You lost them? I must be dreaming. I'm dead. Now I'll stop bothering you. -Cut the shit. -They'll kill me. When he beat me up, I didn't panic. I figured you didn't show up, but that you'd staked them out and you'd nab them later. What did he say? They know where I live. They'll get my girls. They're killers. You saw his knife. What did he say? Tomorrow at 7 p.m. in a mall. With all the money. -Both of us. Understand? -No way. Both of us! Fuck the judge, fuck Francis, fuck your chief! Fuck them all! Let them bust me! You cops like your rats. But when things get hairy, you dump us. "Never saw him. Let him die!" Finished? Not yet. It's too late for me. I'll be in that mall. I have balls. If it backfires, you explain it to Nathalie. I can get the money. -And me? -You need fresh air. Put this on. And leave this here. Where are we going? Tell me where we're going. Sorry, I got carried away. I rattle on and on. My stomach must be leaking all over. Coming? -Get in. -No way. Come on, girls. Let's take a walk. We'll come back for Daddy. What a nice kiss. The chief bought it. We sold your Black guys like quality merchandise! He expects a front page. And Francis? He's not thrilled, but he's covered. -300,000? Did you count it twice? -Yes. Count once more. It can't hurt. Don't lose sight of this money, understand? State property is sacred. Cows are lean these days. Mad, too. Sign the receipt. I'll feel better. Are your six men ready? Yes, but we're a squad of four. Don't nit-pick. Six, four, close enough. -You want backup? -We'll be fine. Thanks, chief. Do a good job. Your cousin seems okay. Prince, is that it? You've got him under control? He's Delvaux's. Same thing. It's your squad. You're responsible. I'll come in an old car. I flash the money, they get the kilo. Then it's up to you. Tail them and we get ten times more. We bust them only in case of emergency. If Gérard removes his cap. Pretty damn cute. It's his. It's hard to see in there. Fanny will be inside. She's miked. She'll keep us posted. Questions? Good. For both squads, code name Mercury. I'll take Daddy Sub. Keys, please. Fifteen minutes to go. Get into position. We're with you on this. I have to show you something. Hello. It's off! Everyone. -Listen to me. -Ten seconds. I couldn't help it. You'd all have refused. The Black guys want him there as a guarantee. I don't give a fuck! He's wanted! He's no small fish. The bigger the bait, the bigger the catch. The same goes for all cousins. It's always been this way. You decide. We can still go play Scrabble at the station. The BMW just entered the parking lot. Mercury here. Gérard won't be alone. My orders stay the same. We'll settle this later. Fuck up and you're dead. Let's go. You can go now! All right. Thanks for telling us, Gérard. He's the Prince of scum! You make a nice pair. I'm scum? Give me that! Who was that? Stop or I'll call it off! No one calls me scum! Let's see. Holy cow! You are a country boy. Great disguise. Hats off! What happened yesterday? How dumb do we look? You want set times? Change jobs. You have it all? Three hundred thousand. All in 500's. Let's keep it visual for now. Buy us a snack. Put the bills to the test. -Just one. -Let me choose. It's nice here. Far away, but nice. Fancy suit. Tailor made? Is it English fabric? Italian? Right. Make fun of us niggers. Wasn't yesterday enough? What did I say now? A present for the kids. Two girls, right? That's enough. You have 30 minutes to get the goods. I'll grab a bite. You have no time. Delivery is immediate. It's here? One of them is leaving. Five kilos tomorrow? If you can pay. How much a gram? -Two hundred fifty. -No, two hundred. He's about to go. Jeannot, you start tailing him. He came out with a bag! It can't be the dope! It is. We won't bust them at home. We'll bust them in there. Get ready! Fanny, wait for the signal. Okay, let's make it 200. -That's today's price too. -What? You heard me. We'll give you 200,000, not 300,000. Bastards! Give me the money! Your turn to die! Put that down! Here, I'm no thief. Move it! His hat's still on! You're dead! I'll waste your wife and kids! Nounours, no. Don't bust them. Tail them. Find their stash. You hear me? -He heard. -Don't panic! Everything's okay. We're police. They did a U-turn! I can't follow. Neither can we. They're going too fast. Jeannot, do like yesterday. Exit 15. I hear you. Exit 15. Over. You don't need that now. Armed robbery! -They held you up! -The cops had the guns. -The cops? -The Inspector over there. -He aimed at the Black guys. -What Black guys? -Your guard? -No, not him. -He had a gun on him? -He grabbed theirs. Just in time, too. Mercury, come in. Listening. I'm in position at the roundabout. Roger. Playing cowboy in a family restaurant! We have a reputation. I'll sue you all. Him first. What a mess. You're a real ass. You'd have done the same thing. You know your job! Yeah, I do. I know the procedure when someone is wanted. Mercury, come in! I read you. Shut up! I've got them! They're right here! Mercury, they're heading for Lognes. Roger. Keep us posted. Subs in the middle! Jesus! How could they just forget you? Are you really a cop? Mercury, we're heading towards Lognes. Is this an oldies' station? Mercury, come in. I traced them home. Rue des Cerisiers. Roger. I found it. We're on our way. Me too! Jeannot, we're in the street. See those cars? It's one house down. They keep coming out to look around. Stay put. I'll get Daddy Sub. -They're leaving. -They're in a rush. They're getting ready to leave. There's a fourth man. White. European. They're taking their stuff. A big suitcase and some bags. Just in front, near the BMW. What will you do? Give it. If they go, nail them. Is the street covered? I'm okay. Me too. Look at the suitcases. They're taking everything! Lucky stiff. Shit. Instead of the BMW, it's a black Mercedes. Copy that. Why take a new car? It's not hot. They're coming out. I'll say when. Mission aborted! Do you read me? They have diplomatic plates. What? Diplomatic plate! Are you deaf? They have immunity. Mission aborted! They're fake plates. Like the BMW's. Who knows? I won't risk it. Mission aborted! No one move! Fucking idiot! Freeze! Drop the gun! Or I'll shoot. Stop the car, you fucker! Stop! Hands! Get out! Don't move! Hands up! How does 250 a kilo sound? What do you mean? How dare you arrest diplomats? Diplomat, my ass! Let's open the trunk. You can't. It's an embassy car. According to law, it's a violation of my territory. Try and stop me. See any DP's? See? No diplomatic plates here. -No way. -Fuck off! -I can search a car! -Not with DP's. How's that? Your colleague is making a big mistake. One kilo of heroin. One. And four makes five. And five makes ten. And four makes fourteen. There. Fourteen kilos of heroin. Fourteen. Here! Three diplomatic passports. Three! So long, Gérard. I saw it on TV. One arrest? The others all walked? Not here. Just a sec. You let countries deal drugs! France has always sold weapons. Its customers need money to buy them with. -Who was the white guy? -Their military advisor. -The others really did walk? -Yes. The one who beat you up is the scapegoat. At least they didn't want the smack back. My family is as good as dead. Go to jail. Let them forget you. Your case is mostly hearsay. With your lawyer, you'll just do a few months. Your family will be safe. And you? I've been demoted for five years. Desk job in a housing project. My home phone. OK. Think it over. Talk to Nathalie, but fast. Everything you said about Philippe… Was it all bullshit? Words are like the wind. Hurry up, Mom. We'll be late! Get the elevator. I'm coming. Where are my keys? Are you seeing the judge? This afternoon. Are you coming? Go on… You're my big girl. Take care of Mom and Emily. Yes, daddy. Is it the same prison? I don't know yet. As for you, draw me lots of pictures. Help with their homework. I want them top of the class. Gérard will bring you for weekend visits. He'll do everything. Listen to him like he's me. -Who let you in? -I have someone for you. Not now. I'm taking a deposition. Show them out. We'll go. Take note: T-Bear surrendered and was sent away. Come on, let's go. Give me a summons. Bad move. She's one tough cookie. Follow me. Everything about Philippe was a bunch of lies. Are you Laoucine Aït Beramane, a.k.a. T-Bear? Yes, but I'm not the only T-Bear. There are tons. I'm the wrong one. Save it for later. Arrest him. -I'll see you on Thursday at 3.30 p.m. -Me? Yes, you helped hide him. I brought him in. That's no excuse. Thursday at 3.30 p.m. Gérard, take care of Nathalie and the kids. Look! Like I said, she's a queen. Thursday. Don't do anything stupid. There are tons of T-Bears. There are 15 in my neighborhood alone. It's like Dupont or Lambert for the French!
