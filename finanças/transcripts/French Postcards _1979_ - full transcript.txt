AND NOW, AS YOU CAN SEE... [DO YOU BELIEVE IN MAGIC? PLAYING IN FRENCH] [SPEAKING FRENCH] WOULD YOU TRANSLATE... THAT QUOTE, IT'S FROM PASCAL. WOULD YOUR TRANSLATE, PLEASE, UH, MONSIEUR? [SNAPPING FINGERS] THAT'S YOU. THAT'S YOU. YES, YOU. FIRST CLASS, FIRST QUESTION. WHAT? I CAN'T HEAR YOU. SPEAK UP. I JUST WONDERED WHY ME. I MEAN, UH, POURQUOI ME? IT WAS THAT DUMB EXPRESSION ON YOUR FACE. I SUPPOSE THAT BEHIND IT, THE BRAIN IS MISSING. [STUDENTS CHUCKLING] ALBERT, ALBERT... CALME-TOI. I ASSUME MY WIFE-- MADAME TESSIER HAS TOLD YOU THAT WE PROVIDE A...CLASSICAL EDUCATION. NOW, I KNOW THAT IN SOME OF YOUR UNIVERSITIES, THE STUDENTS SAY, &quot;OH, NO! &quot;WE DON'T WANT LITERATURE. THAT'S FOR OTHER PEOPLE. &quot;WELL, THIS YEAR... &quot;THIS YEAR, WE THINK WE WILL STUDY... MUSHROOMS.&quot; MUSHROOMS? I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU. HERE...AT MY SCHOOL... YOU WILL NOT STUDY MUSHROOMS!

NOBODY AT THE INSTITUTE'S GONNA KNOW IF YOU DON'T SPEAK FRENCH. I'LL KNOW! JE SAURAI! ANYWAY, I WAS JUST SAYING THAT MR. TESSIER'S A LITTLE WEIRD, YOU KNOW. I MEAN, MUSHROOMS? I'M NOT GONNA COME TO PARIS TO STUDY MUSHROOMS. YOU'RE GONNA EAT THAT THING OFF THE STREET? YEAH. WHY DID YOU COME TO PARIS? WELL, I'M MAJORING IN ROMANCE LANGUAGES, AND MY SCHOOL SUGGESTED COMING HERE. I FIGURED IT'D LOOK GOOD ON MY RECORDS. ACTUALLY, I THINK MY PARENTS WERE JUST TRYING TO GET RID OF ME. I WOULD'VE JOINED THE FOREIGN LEGION TO GET HERE. WHAT'S WRONG WITH OBERLIN? IT'S A GOOD SCHOOL. YEAH, IT'S ALSO IN OHIO.

DEAR DAVID, I ARRIVED IN PARIS WITH GREAT EXPECTATIONS UNTIL I SAW SOME OF THE CULTURAL MEATBALLS THIS PLACE SEEMS TO ATTRACT. [READING IN FRENCH] HEY... YOU WANT TO QUIT MAKING THAT NOISE? AND, DAVID, YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE THE ROOMMATE THEY'VE STUCK ME WITH. HER NAME IS MELANIE, AND, WELL... I AM DOING MY BEST TO REEDUCATE HER RATHER SIMPLE TASTES. OCTOBER 25. DEAR DAVID, SIGHTSEEING WITH MELANIE WAS NOT MY MOST BRILLIANT IDEA. I MEAN, I CAME TO PARIS TO EXPERIENCE THE GREATEST YEAR OF MY LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE SAME PROCESS OF DISCOVERY SEEMS TO BE LOST ON CERTAIN PEOPLE. EVERY DAY AFTER CLASS, I GO OUT, AND I'M CONSTANTLY AMAZED AT WHAT THIS CITY HAS TO OFFER. PARIS' CULTURE AND HISTORY ARE EVERYWHERE AND ALMOST UNAVOIDABLE. NOVEMBER 1. DEAR DAVID, I FINALLY DUMPED MELANIE. BUT YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING WOULD'VE BEEN DIFFERENT IF YOU'D BEEN ABLE TO COME WITH ME TO PARIS THE WAY WE PLANNED. I MISS YOU SO MUCH, DAVID. ANYWAY, THERE ARE 212 IMPORTANT SIGHTS IN THE MICHELIN GUIDE, SO I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR SELF-PITY, BECAUSE I'M GOING TO SEE EVERY ONE OF THEM, DAVID, FOR BOTH OF US. BONJOUR, MONSIEUR. JE CHERCHE...

WE TAKE THE SAME ROUTE. A BOX OF PAPER CLIPS, A CARTON, OR WHAT? HOW MANY IN A BOX? I DON'T KNOW. COUNT THEM. RIGHT. UH, THANK YOU. UH, DEUX, SIX, HUIT. YOU'VE BEEN A LOT OF HELP.

NOT JUST TO SEE THE CITY, BUT MORE THAN THAT, TO SEE AND TO LIVE LIFE, YES? WELL, YES. I MEAN, YOU CAN'T WRITE SONGS IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WRITE ABOUT. I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU.

BECAUSE THIS YEAR, YOU WILL FIND THE THINGS YOU'RE SEARCHING FOR. I WILL? YES. BUT YOU'RE BRIGHT ENOUGH TO ALSO LEARN UP HERE. YOU CAN DO BOTH. LEARN ABOUT LIFE, OF COURSE, BUT ALSO STUDY. WILL YOU DO THAT? FOR ME? YES. YES, I WILL. GOOD. EXCUSE ME. GRRR. FOR ME. SPEAK ENGLISH, ALBERT. YOU NEED THE PRACTICE. OH, CERTAINLY, MY DEAR. YEAH, RIGHT ON, GROOVY, FAR OUT, I GO WITH THE FLOW. ANYWAY, I THINK THIS ALEX, ALEX MOORE, WILL START STUDYING NOW. DID YOU GIVE HIM YOUR STANDARD SPEECH? DID YOU TELL HIM, &quot;YOU ARE SPECIAL&quot;? MM-HMM.

YOU SEE, I'M A PRIVATE DICK. [AUDIENCE CHORTLES] AND IT WAS JOB TO FIND THEM. I THINK THEY LIKE IT. YEAH. THEY JUST LIKE TO WATCH PEOPLE BE HUMILIATED. THANK GOD WE'RE LEAVING THE COUNTRY TOMORROW. ARE YOU STILL SURE YOU WANT ME TO GO WITH YOU? YES. I'M SURE. I'M POSITIVE, AND THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS WORLD THAT IS GOING TO MAKE ME CHANGE... OH, MY GOD. JOEL! MY PARENTS?! DARLING! Alex: THE HEAD HONCHO MUST'VE CAUGHT WIND OF MY INVESTIGATION, 'CAUSE HE TOOK A POWDER SUDDENLY, DECIDED TO MAKE LIKE A TREE, BRANCH OUT AND LEAVE. REMIND ME, NEXT YEAR, NO PLAY.

LISTEN, WHY DON'T YOU AND DAD GO OUT FRONT AND TAKE A SEAT, AND I'LL, UM... TONI? LOOK, I CAN EXPLAIN THIS. YOU DIDN'T EVEN TELL YOUR PARENTS WE WERE GOING BACK TOGETHER. NO, NO, NO. I KNEW YOU'D DO A CHICKEN-OUT. NO, I'M GONNA TELL THEM TONIGHT. WE'LL VISIT THE ORACLE AT DELPHI, SWIM THE HELLESPONT. ALEX, I'D LOVE TO GO TO GREECE. BUT HOW? THAT'S WHAT I FOUND OUT THIS AFTERNOON. IF WE CASH IN OUR RETURN PLANE TICKETS-- THEN HOW DO WE GET HOME? NO PROBLEM. I TOLD YOU NEVER TO SAY THAT. LOOK, WE'LL WORRY ABOUT THAT LATER. THIS WAY WE HAVE THE WHOLE SUMMER TOGETHER. Alex: SHE WAS SCARED. SHE DIDN'T WANT TO TALK, SO I, UH--I TOOK HER TO A LOCAL CAFÉ TO LOOSEN HER UP, AND FIND OUT ABOUT THIS INSTITUTE. SO, WHAT'LL IT BE, KID? A LITTLE VINE ORDINARY? THEN HOW ABOUT SOME SNAILS? OH, I DON'T KNOW. I'VE NEVER EATEN SNAILS. THE THOUGHT OF IT JUST MAKES ME WANT TO PUKE. COME ON, SPLURGE. YOU'LL LOVE 'EM. WAITER! YOU MISSED YOUR CUE! YOU SHOULD BE OUT IN THE AUDIENCE, MADAME TESSIER. IT'S A MUCH BETTER VIEW. I HAVE TO TALK TO ALEX. TALK TO HIM? YES. WHY? I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING ABOUT HIM. SINCE HE CAME BACK TO ME. TO YOU? MMM. HE CAME BACK FOR FINALS. AND LISTEN, WE SHOULD TALK. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND ALEX? WELL, IT'S OVER, OF COURSE. ALEX TOLD ME THAT RIGHT AWAY. I MEAN, YOU DON'T THINK THAT-- LAURA, YOU'RE BEING NAIVE, WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE. YOU'RE A 20-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN SCHOOLGIRL, AND I AM-- YOU'RE LONELY? POOR ME. YOUR HUSBAND DUMPED YOU! DID HE, REALLY? AND I'M SURE THAT THE PRESSURES OF RUNNING THE SCHOOL ARE GETTING TO BE TOO-- TOO WHAT? WAITER! OUI, OUI, OUI. OHH! AFTER THE SNAILS, WE'LL HAVE A... WHAT'S WRONG?
