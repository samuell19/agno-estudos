DENNY: Gather round, gather round and listen. Listen to me now. As you travel through life, you'll encounter many barriers to happiness. You'll go down some rough roads and sometimes you may take a wrong turn. Well, if that happens, take heed of what I say to you now, for some day these words may help you. A long time ago when our land was new and our people young like some of you, there lived in those ancient times an Irish king whose greed and avarice were known throughout the land. A tyrant who would covet and then obtain anything of value within his realm. But with all his treasures and possessions, he knew no happiness. He had no joy or fulfillment, and so, he was unable to find his way. And much like that king of old, there is a man who, not so long ago, thought he had everything in life. Wealth, and fame and power. But he really had nothing. For the one thing he wanted most, eluded him. The love of his lost child. As a young man in a dark and brooding moment, he had wanted to end it all. He was beyond despair, when, suddenly, he was given a second chance. A chance to begin again. And so he did. So you see, my brethren, it is a truth that those who put greed and avarice before love are destined to live a life full of sadness and misery. Ah, but those who put love first will always find the rainbow. So, get out there and start looking for that rainbow. For all you know, it could be right around the corner. (CHUCKLES) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) Oh, God, Denny, look at the time, I'm gonna be late. EAMON: I suppose you're wondering why I called you all together In this way. Especially since I'm now as dead as a doornail. (WOMEN GASP) To my wife Margaret, I leave the house called Second Chance, with all its contents and land, together with a sum of money, which is more than sufficient for her needs. Although, she, of course, will disagree. NURSE: There you are, sir, just a small amount. (DOOR SLAMS) EAMON: Thank you very much. (WHISPERING) Breeta, have you no respect for your father? Can't you leave that creature outside? EAMON: To my elder daughter, Fiona, I leave the business, Byrne Enterprises. Yes! And as she's unencumbered, except for her own incompetence, I advise her to ask Tom Molloy, our Sales Director, to manage the company, but knowing her obstinacy, she'll do no such thing. My younger daughter, Breeta, has already inherited my love of Celtic myths and legends, but since she told me she doesn't care at all about my money, in material terms, I leave her absolutely nothing. And since her boyfriend, Paddy Whelan, showed no desire to become one of the family, I leave exactly the same to him. What is he doing here? If it comes to that, why should she be here? EAMON: But to our housemaid... Shh. Nora Flood, I leave the sum of £2,000 in recognition of her faithful service to us. Ugh! And to John Herlihy, in gratitude for his service as our handyman for 20 years, and especially for his rare devotion during my last horrendous days, I leave the sum of £25,000. And I hope he uses it wisely. Now, Michael Davis. I have the highest opinion of his abilities as our gardener. But I don't trust his financial acumen. Indeed, I have arranged with our senior solicitor, Harry Ryan, to pay him a monthly stipend on condition that he finishes his course in horticulture. Last of all, I hope that Jessica Fletcher will be here as I asked. To her I leave Rose Cottage together with its contents and the land on which it stands. For it was she who long ago gave a second chance in life to a man she didn't even know. (WHEEZES) Outrageous. EAMON: Thank you. NURSE: There you are. I'll bet that put the cat among the pigeons. But I've another wee surprise for you all, so just settle down. JESSICA: I think perhaps I should leave the room. Not at all, Mrs. Fletcher, sit down. This concerns you too. Charlie, would you play that for me, please? Indeedlwill. (SNICKERS) Just like your father, to play silly games. The Last Will and Testament of Eamon Byrne, Part Two. Harry Ryan will hand each one of you a sealed envelope containing a clue. If these clues are shared among you, they will lead to a treasure of inestimable value. But you will have to put aside your differences and work together or the treasure will be lost forever. Amen. Brilliant, Da. Absolutely, bloody brilliant. MARGARET: Breeta! Breeta, we're not finished here yet. FIONA: Oh, let her go, Mother. RYAN: Charlie, hand these out, will you? There's one for everyone except Mr. Herlihy and Mr. Molloy. Yes, yes, I will. Mrs. Fletcher, Nora, Fiona, Michael, Paddy, Mrs. Byrne. Well, uh, I'll keep Breeta's. I'll take it for her. The hell you will! I'll take it to her. I'll take care of that. You know, Mrs. Byrne, Breeta doesn't live here now. And you, Paddy Whelan, are no longer welcome here. (SCOFFS) I think, if you don't mind, I'll take a look around the garden. MICHAEL: Mr. Molloy, Mr. Molloy, Tom, would you wait a minute? Michael. There's something I need to talk to you about. Well, I need to get back to the office. Right. You know, I'm soon going to be a member of the family. Really? Me and Breeta, we're going to get married. She's not interested in the business, but I am. Oh? I dare say it's not doing too well just now. Why do you say that? Well, um... It stands to reason, Eamon's been failing badly the last few months. Michael, you know absolutely nothing about business. That's what Eamon thought, but he was wrong. If you and me sat down and went through the accounts to see what money was lying idle, I have some great ideas of how we could put it to good use. Do you seriously think I'm going to let the gardener look through the accounts? But I told you... When and if you become a member of the family we might, I say might, talk about this again. Meanwhile, I suggest you stick to your flowers. PADDY: I hope you're satisfied. It cost you your inheritance. Oh, I'm sorry, Paddy, I'm sure. But I didn't realize you only wanted me for my money. Oh, come on, that's a bloody stupid thing to say and you know it. Is it? All you ever talk about is the money, Paddy. So it must be the most important thing to you. Well if that's what you really feel, we may as well call it a day. That suits me. Oh, come on, Breeta! MICHAEL: Why don't you leave her alone? And why don't you mind your own business? Oh, Mrs. Fletcher, there you are. Oh, Mr. McCafferty. I wanted to apologize. What must you think of our famous Irish hospitality! Look, I understand that this is a very difficult time. Is Mr. Ryan still here? I'm afraid he's gone back to town. Can I help you with anything? Well, I find myself in a very embarrassing situation. Mr. Ryan's letter invited me to stay at the house, and it's quite obvious that I'm not welcome there. So I thought that if I could get a room at the local hotel, then I could change my plane reservation and leave tomorrow. Oh, no, don't do that. There's some beautiful country around here. And besides, believe it or not, there's some very nice people, too. Oh, I'm sure there are. And, there will be formalities to be completed relating to your inheritance of Rose Cottage. Well, I'm not at all sure that I'm going to accept it. Ah, well, even then, there will be papers to sign. Anyway, the hotel in town is fully booked for the music festival, so you really can't leave. And besides, I have a message from Mrs. Byrne to say that they are just about to sit down to tea, they'd be delighted if you'd join them. And I wonder whose idea that was. I can't imagine. (CHUCKLES) Oh, come on now, Mrs. Fletcher, give us another chance. You know, I'm a great admirer of your mystery books. You are? Indeed I am. Does that settle it then? All right. Good. We'll arrange a meeting in my office. Here's my card. Call me if I can help you with anything. (sums) HERLIHY: Get away would you. Anyone could find it. A wee dog digging for rabbits could come on it. I've half a mind to dig it up myself. NORA: Ah, don't be saying that. HERLIHY: Why not? I've as much right to it as any of them. John Herlihy, have you never heard Denny sing of "The Lost Boy"? You stupid bitch, would you stop blabbering on about "The Lost Boy"? I tell you, he'll be the death of us all. HERLIHY: He doesn't exist. It's just one of Denny's songs. Can't you get that through your daft head? He doesn't exist! That's the trouble with John Herlihy. One jar is never enough. And ten is too many. Oh, they're waiting on you in the sitting room, Ma'am. Thank you very much. FIONA: Mrs. Fletcher, I dare say you're expecting Rose Cottage to be a charming Irish home. I'm sure when you see it, you won't even want it. It's very small and there isn't even a thatched roof. Well, presumably, there are roses around the door. I imagine that's why it was called Rose Cottage. Oh, dear. Nora, you're so clumsy. I'm sorry, ma'am, I'll fetch a cloth. MARGARET: Get out! If you don't mind, I'd love to have a look at it after tea. Thank you. Mrs. Fletcher, I should tell you that I intend to contest my husband's will. He was clearly out of his mind when he left you that cottage. Hello there. Oh, hello there. I wonder, could you point me in the direction of Rose Cottage? Indeed I could, ma'am, just follow the path up ahead and you'll see it on the right. Ah, thank you. Will you be warm enough? Oh, I think so. I'll walk fast. They keep the key under the mat. Thank you. Bream'? Hi. How did you know it was me? Your friend. Oh, I suppose being a mystery writer makes you a nosey parker as well. Guilty as charged. And it does mean that I notice things. Such as? Well, such as, that it's not the easiest thing to be the youngest member of the family. Hmm. Well, my mother thinks I'm totally crazy. And all Fiona ever thinks about is herself. But your father understood. Yeah, he did, until, uh... Well, Rose Cottage belongs to you. And everything that's in it, but I would like to keep this, please. Oh, yes, of course, that belonged to your father. How do you know that? Well, he was wearing it in the video. Would you like a cup of tea? Oh, I'd love some. I'll just put her in her box. There you go. Paddy Whelan tells me that you're not staying at Second Chance. No. You probably guessed I've been living here. Well, you're welcome to stay on here. You and your friend. Her name's Ooshna. I'll remember that. Hello, Ooshna. I'm Jessica. Well, now, Jessica. Why did my Da leave you Rose Cottage? And what did he mean about the second chance you gave him? It's a long story. It happened some time ago. You see... (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Breeta, lthought you might be here. I just wanted to be sure Mrs. Fletcher found the place all right. Well, she could hardly miss it, Michael. No, you're right. But thank you for your concern. Ay, Breeta, your mother put your envelope in her desk. I think you should ask her for it. Why should I? Well, Eamon said that we should all work together. And you'll know better than anyone how your father's mind worked. You were always doing crosswords together. Are you going to share your clue with us, Mr. Davis? It's Michael. And indeed I am. "A piercing spear waging war." And mine is... (READING) These sound as if they come from a poem. Yeah, it is. It's an old Celtic poem called The Song ofAmairgen. Denny will probably sing it at the music festival. Who's Denny? Oh, he's the local crackpot. Michael, he's not. He's a sort of a poet. I heard Nora talking about "The Lost Boy." What did she mean by that? Well, it's one of the songs Denny always sings. I'm sure Nora must have heard it. She was talking to John Herlihy in the kitchen about it. You heard her, didn't you, Michael? I don't really remember what she was saying. Maybe it was part of the clue she was given. Breeta, do you have any notion what the treasure might be? No. I don't. You must have an idea. For God's sake, Michael, I don't, okay? And I don't care. I told my Da I didn't give a fig for his money or the treasure. It can stay hidden for all I care. Okay? I better get after her. When she's het up, she can act like an idiot. MICHAEL: Breeta. Breeta, wait a minute! (READING) Oh, my goodness! Nora? Nora? Nora? (BUMPING SOUNDS) Nora? 0h. my God! (BUMPING SOUNDS) Mrs. Fletcher? Mrs. Fletcher. Yes? I'm Inspector O'Dwyer. I understand you've had a very distressing experience. Oh, yes. Would you show me exactly what happened? Oh, yes, of course. It's right up here in the barn. So, you just walked inside and John Herlihy fell through that trapdoor? Yes. That's right. He fell head-first. Did he, indeed? When I went to feel his pulse, I'm almost sure that he was dead. So you saw him fall through the trapdoor and he landed on his head and that's what killed him. No. I don't believe it was the fall that killed him. You see, when I examined him he had a severe hematoma on the back of his neck. Now, that could have killed him outright. But there was an undeveloped one on his forehead that he got on the way down on the trapdoor. No. Are you in the medical field? Ah, right, so as a mystery writer, you are looking for the unexpected, and, if you don't mind me saying so, the sensational. Well, not when... You see a man fall through a trapdoor, and you say, "Ah, sure, the fellow was hit on the back of the head." Well, it appeared... As a hard-working policeman, I'm looking for the likely. Your man, John Herlihy, was a known drunk, and our people found half a bottle of whiskey up there. So I'd say, he tumbled through the trapdoor, hit his forehead as he fell, and landed on the back of his head, and that's what killed him. All right, but I'm almost sure that immediately after he fell I heard the sound of movement, someone up there. Well, there'|| be a post-mortem, sure that will tell us how the poor fellow died. Excuse me. MICHAEL: Breeta, Breeta. Are you all right? Yeah. I just feel a bit sick. I have something to tell you. Look, if it's about John Herlihy... He's been killed, I know, and I'm real sorry, but Breeta, this is about you and me. Michael, there is no you and me, okay? We're just friends. I can't tell you why, but, Breeta, things are going to be different. I have prospects now. Good prospects. No. No. No, you and your get-rich-quick schemes. I don't want to hear about them. I'm going to Rose Cottage and I want to be on my own. Mr. Whelan, are you on your way to Second Chance? Maybe you could show me the way. Uh, sure. Okay. That was a terrible thing about John Herlihy. Yeah, well I never cared for the fella myself. Oh? Not that I wished him any harm or anything, but he was always on the make, you know. Eamon could never see it. Are you in business, Mr. Whelan? I own a garage. Oh, family business? No. I don't come from around here. Oh, I see. I came from Connemara, looking for work, and Eamon Byrne gave me a job. Then the owner of the garage died. And you bought it. I did. Well, with the help of Eamon Byrne. Oh, that was very nice of him. Well, there's Second Chance. You should be all right now. Thank you. Thank you very much. FIONA: As our attorney, what are you saying, Charles? Really? Are you sure of that, Charles? What? What does he say? Mother, wait, I'm on... Yes, Charles. Yes. I see. Right. Thank you. Goodbye. Charles agrees with us. Father couldn't have done it by himself, so he must have asked John Herlihy to hide the treasure. That's why Herlihy got no envelope. And now he's dead so no one knows where the treasure is. It's just as well. When he was drunk he could have told anyone. What about that ridiculously large bequest? £25,000. How much is that in Euros? Charles says that under the terms of the will, Herlihy's bequest comes back to the estate. Oh, well that's something, I suppose. Though it should come to me! FIONA: Oh, for God's sakes, Mother. MARGARET: I'm only saying, as the senior survivor that the money is mine. FIONA: He left you a very substantial amount. How much money do you need? It's not that I need anything, I'm only suggesting that we do the right thing, Fiona. Oh? Mrs. Fletcher. We were just saying, what a terrible tragedy about poor John Herlihy. And, I gather, you were there when it happened. Yes, I was. Oh, the poor man. Ah, you must be exhausted. Fiona, tell Nora to show Mrs. Fletcher up to her room. Thank you. She's wailing and howling like a banshee. You'd have thought John Herlihy was a close relative. Well, tell her to stop. Poor Nora. Nora, will you come here! Ah, the poor creature, Mother of God, help us all. Oh, God! MARGARET: Nora, stop that. Come here. You show Mrs. Fletcher up to her room. I will, ma'am. Thank you. You've been with the family a long time, I expect. Oh, no, only since... That is, I took over when Kitty Murphy got too old to carry on. Ah, you applied for the job? Well, I got a letter from an employment agency saying there was this job and why didn't I go in for it. So I did. I see. Here's your room. Let me know if there's anything you need. Thank you. Oh, this is very nice. I'm sorry to have caused you so much trouble at this sad time. You shouldn't stay in this place. There's one who'll stop at nothing to get the treasure. MOLLOY: Well, Mrs. Byrne, is there anything else you need before the meeting tomorrow? No. But you better think about what I said. Ah, Mrs. Fletcher. You remember Tom Molloy, our Sales Director. Oh, yes, of course. Hello. Hello. Tom, get Mrs. Fletcher a glass of sherry. We were just talking about Eamon's will. And the treasure. I have to say, if it were up to me, I'd get everyone together, we'd open the envelopes, have a grand party as we all sat around and solved the riddle. (LAUGHS) Well, it's got nothing to do with you. Exactly, Fiona. It is, Tom, or should be, a family matter. My envelope is under lock and key in the desk along with Breeta's. Oh, Fiona. Here. (CRASHING) What's that woman up to now? I'd better go and see. What a fascinating collection! I suppose it's all Celtic. MOLLOY: Oh, yeah, and very valuable, too, I should imagine. I never shared my husband's enthusiasm for old weapons. Mother, she's not in the kitchen. I don't know where she is. Well, find her. And when you do, give her a good talking-to. Can't have her disappearing like that. I can do with a ride into town, Tom. You'll excuse us, Mrs. Fletcher. Oh, yes. Nora? Nora are you all right? Nora? Oh, that's very good of you, but you really don't have to. Oh, I like to help. Did you find Nora? No, but she often goes off on her own. I'll get the rest of the glasses. Oh. (NORA PRAYING NERVOUSLY) Oh, Mother of God. Deliver us from temptation. Oh, Mother of God, it's you. You've killed him, haven't you? Don't hurt me, please. |won't tell. I forgot, I didn't bring my clue. Don't get angry. I swear, I'll help, but please... (DOOR CLOSING) Oh, God. (GLASS BREAKING) (GLASS BREAKING) Is someone there? Oh! Well done, lads. Take a cast of the footprint. Mrs. Fletcher, are you sure you shouldn't go to the hospital just to make sure? Thank you. I'm quite all right, just a few bruises. You couldn't identify the intruder? It all happened so quickly. The door hit me, and I went flying backwards and by the time I'd got myself together, whoever it was had gone. Just as well. You say the only item missing was a short sword, Mrs. Byrne? Presumably the thief would have taken more if Mrs. Fletcher hadn't interrupted. Yes, although, I can't help wondering if possibly whoever it was, might have been looking for something in that desk. Maybe we should have a look and see if anything's missing. Oh, I'm sure there isn't. What about the clues to this treasure I keep hearing about? Were any of them kept there by any chance? They're all there. I dare say you have Mrs. Fletcher to thank for that. We found the imprint of a rubber boot outside the door, so, if we could have a look at any Wellington boots you have in the house just to eliminate them. We keep them in the back hall. I'll have a look, sir. Well, we have to be going. We have a meeting to go to. You don't mind, Mrs. Fletcher? Oh, no. I'm sure you'll be glad of a bit of peace and quiet. Come along, Fiona. I'm coming. You have the results of the postmortem for John Herlihy? Yes. You were quite right. It was that blow to the back of the head that killed him. Then it was murder. I'm afraid so. (MEOWS) Oh, my, you startled me. Did I startle you? Of course, that's how it was done. MAN ON RADIO: Tonight, tonight at The Railway Bar the start of the Celtic Festival! This shows the financial situation in these areas for the past six months. There's peat, there's granite, and these are the building contracts. MARGARET: Oh, my word! You mean they're all losing money? I'm afraid so. And this shows the overall financial situation of the firm. FIONA: You're actually saying that we're in the red. But Father always seemed so confident. I'm afraid he was failing very badly in the last three years. I did try to warn him. What are we going to do? CHARLES: Well, I don't want to step on Tom Mo||oy's toes, I know that Eamon thought very highly of him... Sounds to me as though Tom Molloy got us into this mess. |wouldn't say that, but I will leave you with these suggestions. If Tom doesn't agree with them... Oh, Tom will agree. I'll see to that. Well, I have to go. I have a meeting with Mrs. Fletcher in a half an hour. Tell her that I will never let her have Rose Cottage. Mmm. Fiona. Can I help you? Yes, I have an appointment with Mr. McCafferty. It's Jessica Fletcher. He has someone with him right now. Would you like to have a seat? PADDY: What the hell did I come down here for? You can't help me. That's all I need to know. Oh, Mr. Whelan. Hi, Mrs. Fletcher. Mrs. Fletcher, I'm so sorry. I needed to see Paddy Whelan on something rather unexpected. Please, do come in. Thank you. He seemed upset. Paddy's a bit of a rough diamond with quite a hot temper on him, but there's no real harm in him. He was upset that Eamon didn't leave him any money. Especially since there was a bequest to Michael Davis. Exactly so. There's always been a rivalry between the two of them. And, of course, it's common knowledge that Paddy's garage is in financial difficulties. So finding the treasure would be important to him. Oh, well, I suppose it would. Please, do sit down. Thank you. Will you have a drink? Oh, thank you, no. It's a little early for me. Oh, it is for me too, but truth to tell, I thought a drop of whiskey might calm Paddy down. You have a beautiful office. I'm afraid that it's one of my failings. I like to surround myself with beautiful things. Connemara... I've never been there. But I hear it's beautiful. I've never been there either. That was given to me and I keep it out of sentiment. Now, have you thought any more about Rose Cottage? I have. And I'm still uncertain. Ah. If Mrs. Byrne decides to contest the will, would you be able to give me the name of a good solicitor? Oh, yes, I can recommend a grand firm in Dublin. Thank you, that will be very helpful. Wasn't it terrible news about the murder of John Herlihy? Ah, so it was murder, then. Mmm-hmm. Well, that's terrible. Mr. Molloy. Mr. Molloy. Have you got a moment? No. No, I don't. Look, just a second, please. What is it? I was just over at Mr. McCafferty's to see if there was anything I could do about the will. What about the will? You can't change it. No, I know, that's what he said. It's just... I'm having some trouble with my business. Look, the fact that Eamon gave you money to start that garage doesn't mean his estate is responsible for it. You're on your own there, boys. Look, all I'm asking is... I told you. Now leave me alone. PADDY: Well thanks for nothing, Molloy. God, you people are all the same, you, McCafferty, the whole bloody lot of you. You don't care about anything but your own little worlds. Well, we'll make it, me and Breeta. We'll show you. And you can all go to hell. (IRISH MUSIC PLAYING) Listen to me, Margaret! I don't agree at all. You're just throwing good money after bad. Look, the money's gone somewhere, that's for certain. We might as well try to save what's left. If Charles' plan... What does Charles know? He's not a businessman! Well, neither, apparently, are you! Mother, keep out of this. All I'm saying is that the business started losing money when Charles McCafferty took over the affairs of Byrne Enterprises. Oh, yeah. Wasn't that the same time when you became Sales Director? That was great. Oh, they're just getting started. Can I get you something to drink? A glass of whiskey? No, thank you. I'll have a small sherry. I'll take an orange juice. Orange juice? I've never known you to refuse whiskey. All right, Breeta, orange juice it is, then. Oh, Mr. Whelan? Yeah. You told me that you had a garage. Do you, by any chance, have a taxi service? I certainly do. Saint Brendan Motors, at your service. Good. I need to go into Rathgen early tomorrow. I need to give a statement to the police about the death of John Herlihy. Don't bother with a taxi, I'll drive you there myself. Thanks a bunch. Is 9:00 too early? Mmm-hmm. I've been wondering, you promised to tell me why Da left you Rose Cottage. Ah, yes, I did. Well, I was taking a walk one evening along the cliff in Cabot Cove. And up ahead of me I saw this young man and he was standing, looking down at the rocks below. And he looked so alone. I had the feeling that he was going to throw himself over the edge. And that was my Da? Yes. I yelled at him and he hesitated long enough for me to run up and grab him and pull him away. So you saved his life. Well, we sat down and we talked and he was in a terrible state of despair. He said that after what he had done, he didn't deserve to live. And I told him that everybody deserved a second chance. Did he tell you what he'd done? No. He simply said that he had betrayed a sacred trust. I'm the Sales Director, not a bloody accountant. Give me something to sell and I sell it. There's nothing wrong with my sales. It's the company profits that have taken a nosedive. Well I still don't think it's Charles' fault. Maybe not. Well, don't look at me! And don't you look at me! It's not my fault the company's in the red. Someone's undermining this business, and I'd like to know who it is. Well, why should anyone do such a thing? What if Eamon was being blackmailed? Maybe he was fiddling with the books to cover up that someone was squeezing him. But who? Who could it have been? I don't know. Unless... What do you know about Paddy? Just that he came here from Connemara and Father set him up in business. That's a funny sort of thing to do, to set up a total stranger in business. Unless Paddy had some sort of hold over him. Yeah, well if it comes to that, why take Michael in and pay for his education? Why indeed? Do you mind if I ask you a rather personal question? No. I often ask them myself. Why did you fall out with your father? Oh, we, uh, we quarreled over Paddy Whelan. I thought he liked Paddy. He gave him the money for the garage, didn't he? Yeah, he did, but... Did your father know that that you were pregnant? How did you know? Well, I couldn't help noticing how surprised Michael was when you ordered an orange juice. (LAUGHS) Yeah, I told my Da, and he said it was a terrible thing to bring a child into the world with no daddy. Yes, but he liked Paddy. Yeah, but I told him Paddy and I don't believe in marriage. (HONKING) What does this idiot think he's doing? I think you should pull over and let him pass. I can't get over. Are you quite sure you're all right, Breeta? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Paddy is not answering his phone. Isn't that just like him! He must have it switched off. (SIREN BLARING) Mrs. Fletcher, Miss Byrne, are you all right? Oh, yes, Inspector, I'm perfectly all right. I'm really worried about Breeta. We were forced off the road. Would you agree, Miss Byrne? I mean, that it was a deliberate act and not just an accident. How would I know the way people drive these days. Did you get a registration number? No. I'm afraid I didn't. I was too busy trying to keep my car on the road. Mrs. Fletcher? I didn't catch it either. But I did see that it was a white van. A very dirty one. A dirty white van. Not much to go on, I'm afraid. We'll look into it. Mrs. Fletcher, we'll get a tow truck for Breeta. If you'd come with me to Rathgen and give your statement, I'll see you get back to Ballymure. Of course. The Garda will take care of you, darling. Okay, thanks. Mrs. Byrne, I'm sure you heard that Breeta and I were forced off the road today. It was probably an accident. Breeta's always imagining things. Well, no one imagined the murder of John Herlihy or the robbery at your house. I really do think that it may have something to do with this treasure. And I think it has nothing to do with you. Well, actually it has a great deal to do with me because Eamon left me a clue to the treasure. Well, obviously he was out of his mind. I'd like to know what kind of a hold you had over him. Were you blackmailing him? I suppose if we look at his bank accounts now we'll find that he was sending you money. Mrs. Byrne, the incident that took place between Eamon and me was private. But this I can tell you, when he became successful he sent me a check for £10,000. Ha! I sent it back. I didn't keep it. And that was the last I heard, until Mr. Ryan sent me a round-trip ticket and asked me to be here because I was a beneficiary in Eamon's will. Is Breeta all right? Yes, yes, she is. We were both very shaken up. Mrs. Fletcher. Oh, Mr. Whelan. Do you know someone driving this van forced Breeta off the road this morning. What? Is she all right? Yes, yes, I think so. Well, what makes you think it was this van? Well, I was riding with her and I saw the name on the side. And the paint here matches the color of her car. Well, I went out early in my tow truck to fetch a broken down car. You know, she tried to telephone you, but there was no reply. Mobile phones don't work up in the hills. Could anyone else have taken it without your knowing? I suppose. The keys are always kept in the office. Yeah... Breeta, have you met any of Paddy's family? No, I don't think he has any. He's a bit of a loner. I guess that's why we get on so well. You know, that white van that ran us off the road today, that was Paddy's. I saw the name. And there was a smear of red paint on the side of the van that matches the paint of your car. No. It couldn't have been Paddy driving. He'd never do anything to hurt me or the baby. Yes, that's what lthought, but... You didn't tell O'Dwyer, did you? No, but I really should. Oh, no, don't. Please don't. Paddy's had a few brushes with the police. Nothing serious, but when he loses his temper, he'll do anything. Paddy, hey! Hey, would you take a look at my car and make sure it's working okay? Oh, we're on speaking terms again now are we? Sure, I'll have a look at it. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. And why shouldn't she be? Well, we were forced off the road by a white van this morning. You've got a white van, Paddy, haven't you? What the hell do you mean by that? Look, would you two just stop. We're here to have fun. BREETA: Come on, Jessica, let's go inside. I'll get the drinks, okay? Right, I'll get a table. MICHAEL: What about your clue to the treasure, Paddy? When are you gonna put it on the table with the rest of us? I'm not putting it anywhere where a chancer like you can get your hands on it. Oh, chancer, is it? I'm not the one whose business is on the skids. And I suppose you're not the one who pinched the sword. You're right about that. I don't have to steal from the Byrnes. Breeta and me are getting married. Paddy, no, stop, just stop. PADDY: Did you hear what that bastard said? What did you call me? You heard what I called you. I called you a bastard! I don't care what you called him, okay? I am sick to death of you and this damned temper of yours. All right, fine, then you have him. You want him, you got him. Have him! Have him! ANNOUNCER ON MICROPHONE: Would you all hold your noise down? Come on, lads, lads, please! Come on. Now, give me your attention over here. My Uncle Denny's going to come out here now and he's gonna tell you all a story. So if I can just get you all to put your hands together with a little bit of encouragement for my old Uncle Denny. (CROWD APPLAUDS) Thank you very much. I will tell you the tale of Nuada. Nuada of the Silver Hand! Will you have a little patience? And you've got it wrong! He was Nuada Argat-I am, Nuada Silver Arm... (CELL PHONE RINGING) but he wasn't called that till later. Hello. Nuada was king of the Tuatha de Danaan, and they were gods, but they could die too, like the rest of us. King Nuada was a great fighter, aided by his mighty sword, from which no one could escape once it was drawn. I'll be right back. And he fought the great battle of Mag Tured, and defeated the Fir Belg, but... There was a price to pay. Sure, there was a price to be paid... lthought you'd come around. For in that battle, Nuada lost his hand, and because any King of the Tuatha de had to be perfect, he could be king no more. We don't need the police involved. And you were quite right, Herlihy would blab to anyone when he was drunk, and that was most of the time. From that day on he was known as Nuada Argat-I am, Nuada Silver Arm, and sure didn't that arm work just as well as the ones you have yourselves. So, how about a drink? I better get back. So it's agreed. I didn't see anything and I get half the treasure. (GROANS) (TIRES SCREECH) I know he was a bit of an idiot, and he never knew when to hold his tongue, but he was my friend. Oh, of course he was. You know, he told me that he loved me, but I, uh... You love Paddy Whelan. Yeah. God, it's just so horrible to think about Michael being murdered. Mrs. Fletcher, Miss Byrne, do you feel up to a few questions now? I understand that Michael Davis was sitting at the table with you. Yeah, he was. He got a call on his cell phone. He went away, but he said that he would be right back. I believe it was that call that lured him to his death. Oh, God. I'm sorry. Inspector O'Dwyer, I wonder if, by any chance, you found an envelope that looks like this on Michael's body? I'll find out, sir. Sorry, Paddy, no one's allowed inside. Ah come on, Deirdre. I've got to see Breeta. She'll be devastated. DEIRDRE: Well I can't let you through. That's enough, Paddy. Now I have to see to this lady here. What is it, ma'am? No envelope was found on the body, sir. I saw him put it in his pocket right after he got here. Now just earlier he had shared his clue with us. Now, I don't believe that the murderer knew that. I'm almost sure that Michael Davis was in the barn when John Herlihy died. I believe that he was hiding there and that he may have seen the murderer. Now, when I was at the barn that day, I found a piece of fabric. Tonight, I noticed Michael Davis' jacket had a tear in it. And you think that's why he was murdered? PADDY: Breeta! Oh, Paddy, it's horrible. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Ah, Paddy, I understand there was a bit of unpleasantness between you and the dead man. Would you mind telling me what it was about? It was a private matter. Is it true that he was stabbed with a sword taken from Second Chance? Word travels fast. Well, I don't have any more questions for you now. You may leave. That's the one. It's Paddy. Paddy? Are you sure? MARGARET: I simply can't imagine why anyone should want to kill Michael. Nora, you've forgot the marmalade. Again. Well, I believe that the murderer took the envelope with the clue out of Michael Davis' pocket. And, Nora, bring some more hot water, will you? I mean, first John Herlihy and then Michael Davis, both murdered because of the treasure. Hmm. I'm worried about who might be next. Mother, give me the key to the desk drawer. What for? Just give it to me. They were always fighting, you know. Michael and that Paddy Whelan. I expect Paddy murdered him, it had nothing whatsoever to do with some treasure. I'm sorry, but I think you're wrong. What do you think you're doing? Mother, I agree with Jessica. Enough is enough. Breeta is the only one who can solve the clues. Will you give this to her? I will. And mine, as well. Thank you. Mother? Thank you. You can put mine back in the desk. BREETA: What on earth is that? It's just lines. Well, let's take a look at Fiona's, put it with the others and see what we've got. "The beauty of a plant." Is that also from The Song ofAmairgen? Yeah. But it doesn't help us much. Hmm. "| am the sea-swell." "A piercing spear waging war." Well, where's Paddy's? He said he was gonna drop his by this evening, but if we can't make head nor tail of any of them, then... Could they possibly be anagrams? I mean, I know that your Dad enjoyed doing crossword puzzles... Yeah, he did, but... Well, we'll add Fiona's. Hmm? Thafsit The poem's written in Gaelic. Gaelic? Of course! So, all I have to do is put the clues back into the Gaelic language and try to make an anagram out of them. That's why he did it this way. He knew you were the only one who knew Gaelic. It was Eamon's way of making sure that you got your share of the treasure. You see, he did leave you a bequest after all. I think perhaps he did. You keep working on this. Do you know where I'd find Nora at this time? Oh, it's her afternoon off. She likes to go to Brigie Murphy's tearoom. You know the Avondale Cafe, right? Yes, thanks. Hello, Jessica. Oh, hello. You caught me. I slipped out from the office to indulge my vice. Brigie Murphy's homemade cakes. I recommend the sponge. Oh, I'll remember that. Do you mind if ljoin you? Your usual Nora? Oh, please, let me. A pot of tea for two and scones with jam and cream and sponge cake. How does that sound? So, the employment agency just wrote to you saying that the Byrne family needed someone to replace Kitty Murphy? That's right. That's the way it was. Is Kitty Murphy still alive? Ah, sure. I don't think that one will ever die. Doesn't she live upstairs with Brigie? A drop more tea? Lovely. Do you remember the name of the employment agency? I can't remember. Funny sort of name. Began with an I gave the letter to Mrs. Byrne when I came for the interview. Very sad about John Herlihy, wasn't it? It was. Although I never liked him that much. No, he did seem a rather difficult sort of chap. I heard him shouting at you in the kitchen. Nora, who is "The Lost Boy"? I can't. I mustn't. Here. You'd better have this. I'll tell him I've lost it. Tell who? I can't tell you. Wait, Nora, here's my cell phone number. If you have any trouble don't hesitate to call me. NORA: (NERVOUSLY) Oh, Mary, Mother of God... MAN ON RADIO: He throws a hard right to the head of the challenger... Hello? Kitty? Are you there? He's moving quickly now. He throws a right, and then a left. Oh, look out! The ref steps in... (CLEARS THROAT) (RADIO CLICKS OFF) Do forgive me. I believe you're Kitty Murphy. Why, it's Jessica Fletcher. The lady mystery writer. Sit down, sit down. Oh, my! I hope you don't mind, I wanted to ask you about the Byrne family. But sure I love to talk about the old times. Especially poor Eamon, he was such a dear, wee fellow. Not like his father, a great, big bully. He was from nothing but he was hell-bent and determined his son would climb still higher. Marrying well was one way of it. But Eamon, ah... He fell in love? He did so. And he got her in the family way. Mick Byrne sent her off to Connemara to have the child. Mick Byrne made sure that the child was adopted. Oh, that poor girl. What became of her? Mick arranged with her father that she should be married off to someone else. But the night before the wedding, she hanged herself. Oh, my God. No wonder Eamon never forgave himself. What was her name? Her name was Rose. Rose MacRoth. And Eamon left me Rose Cottage. And he married Margaret and they had the two girls. But he never stopped looking for his son. He had a son? Excuse me. But you have no business to be up here troubling my mother. Mind your own business, Brigie. So, Rose's child was a boy? Oh, a fine boy! Oh, Eamon knew that. But he never could find out who adopted him. "The Lost Boy." Did Rose have any other family? Her mother and father are dead. She did have a sister. Mrs. Fletcher knows her. Nora? Ah, Inspector. Ah, Mrs. Fletcher. I've just had a cup of tea with Nora Flood. Tell me, what do you know about Eamon Byrne's family? Very little. I know he came from Limerick. Yes. Did you know that he had a son? Out of wedlock? That was given up for adoption? Ah, we're not on about the wee boy now again, are we, Mrs. Fletcher? Oh, no, he'd be about 35 years old. And what? Angry? Bitter? Greedy? Murderous? It's a possibility. I'm on my way to Rose Cottage. If you take the shortcut, by the church, through the graveyard, you'll be there in no time. Thank you. (CHURCH BELLS RINGING) Good heavens! You're right. The Ogham! And what's that? It's an ancient Celtic script, the first known written language in Ireland. I saw a reference to it in this little book, but I didn't know what it looked like. Your clue is different from the carving I saw in the graveyard, but it's the same general idea. I know there's a group of lines for each letter of the alphabet. I'll have to check one of my Da's reference books, though. (KNOCKING) Ah, Paddy, I wonder if you'd be so good as to come with us to the station? No. Jessica? Pardon me, Sergeant. Are you arresting Mr. Whelan? Just asking him to assist the police with their enquiries about the murder of Michael Davis. Don't worry, love. They can't keep me. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hello? Nora? Nora, calm down. What kind of danger? No, no. Just, uh... Where are you? Well, just come over to Rose Cottage. You'll be quite safe here. All right, all right. I'll come right away. I'm sorry, I have to go for a minute. I'll be right back. Will you be all right? Yeah. Good. Nora? Nora! (DIALING CELL PHONE) Yes, it's Jessica Fletcher. I must speak to Inspector O'Dwyer. Yes, I understand that. But would you get a message to him, please? No, no, his voicemail won't do. Oh, oh, all right. Inspector O'Dwyer, this is Jessica Fletcher. Please call me as soon as you get this message. It's very, very urgent. I'm sure that Nora Flood is in terrible danger. Don't look. Charles, I am so glad you're here. You've heard about Nora? Inspector O'Dwyer came by. He said her neck was broken. Ah, I came by to see if there's anybody from the family I should notify. Do you know anything about her family? No. When I joined the firm she was already working for the Byrnes. Breeta is distraught. And now with Paddy in custody. Paddy? They seem to think that he killed Michael. That's ridiculous. Apparently Nora said that she saw him in the telephone box at the time Michael received the call. And his prints were all over the murder weapon. That's extraordinary. I'd better go to Rathgen and see what I can do. I might be able to get him out on bail. Thank you, Charles. Breeta really needs him now. FIONA: Poor Nora. JESSICA: She said, "He's watching me all the time." But who? Who was she afraid of? She wouldn't say. Do you still have the letter from the employment agency? Nora said she gave it to you. I have no idea. But you know, if it was anywhere it would be in that desk. Mother never throws anything away. Just a moment... Aha! The Marchot Employment Agency. You know, I remember now, I thought it was strange that they should tell her that there was a job here, so I kept this letter, just in case she proved less than satisfactory. So you didn't write to them first? Oh, no, no. I'd never heard of them. Oh. BREETA: These seem to be anagrams of different places around here. I've marked them on the map but they're just dotted around all over the place. Have you got a list of the order in which the clues come in the poem? What would happen if we put them in that order? Now that would make the first one in Ballymure, right? Right. And we don't count mine, so, that's Michael's, Paddy's, and there's yours too, Jessica. That's right. And then there's Nora's, and Fiona's and that would be five. It would really help if we had my mother's clue. What we do have seems to lead right into these hills. But where exactly? But what about your clue? Have you had any luck with your research on the Ogham? The only thing I could make out, is that it seemed to be the Celtic word for "tortoise." (KNOCKING AT DOOR) (DOOR OPENING) Hey, Breeta. Hey. Charles McCafferty told O'Dwyer he didn't have enough to hold me on, so he'd better charge me or let me go. Good old Charlie. Well, what about your fingerprints on the sword? Ah, that was all nonsense. I said I was often in the house and could have handled it at anytime. And did you? Who knows? Did they tell you about Nora? Yes. I wouldn't have wished her any harm, poor creature. But apparently she said I was the one who phoned Michael at the pub. But you didn't? I did not. I didn't have my mobile phone with me, so I went to the box to call Breeta, but her mobile was switched off. We've simply got to figure out where this treasure is before someone else is murdered. PADDY: Well let's hope that doesn't happen. Breeta, you keep on working. I'm going to check something out. Okay. Did you want something? Oh, sorry, did I startle you? It's all right, I took everything out and put it away. I must be getting jumpy. There's a murderer about. Now Fiona's gone into town. With Tom Molloy. We're all alone. Pretty frightening, with all these murders. And I think I know why you're here. You know, Jessica, perhaps I should have listened to you. Here. Give that to Breeta, will you? Thank you. Hello? Breeta? (CAR ENGINE STARTING) (CAR DRIVING AWAY) BREETA: "Dear Jessica, I think I solved it. ”Da knew that! loved my tortoise. 'Wt wasn't an anagram after all, it was a name." Ooshna. Her name is Ooshna. BREETA: "Paddy and I have gone to get the treasure. ”It's on the road to Rathgen. I know we'll find it. It's marked. Love, Breeta." "P.S. Its proper name is Uisnech, the Heart of Ireland, but it's pronounced Ooshna. "It's a hermit's cave." Marchot, Marchot, of course, that's an anagram for MacRoth. Oh, my God, the fingerprints. Oh, Breeta. (DIALING) Yes, this is Jessica Fletcher. I must speak to Inspector O'Dwyer. I have an urgent message for him. Say that Breeta Byrne is in grave danger. She and Paddy Whelan have gone to the hermit's cave at Ooshna Hill, and I'm going to follow them there. Do you understand? Are you trying to kill yourself altogether? I'm so sorry. But I need a lift urgently. Are you going anywhere near Ooshna? I never heard of it. I'm going to Rathgen. Well, that's good enough. Can you go a little faster? Don't ask me, ask the car. Right here is fine. I think I know where I'm going now. Thank you very much. Jessica? What have you done with Paddy and Breeta? What makes you think I've done anything with them? You were at Rose Cottage earlier, weren't you? Yes... Well... I came by to accept grateful thanks for securing Paddy's release, and also to see how you were getting on with the clues. But luckily the door was open, and I realized that they'd solved the puzzle. Just then I heard someone coming. I knew it wouldn't do to be found there so I quickly made my exit. Fortunately, my car is a lot faster than Paddy's old van and I was able to take a shortcut and get here first. I even had time to leave them a note. It said, "Well done, but you're not quite there, yet. "There's another cave called Uisnech. "Keep looking, Eamon." So, Paddy and Breeta snapped up the note and left. Leaving you to find the treasure. Now, you didn't really think I'd do them any harm, did you? You murdered John Herlihy. What? Why on Earth would I do that? Because he wouldn't tell you where the treasure was, and you were afraid that when he was drunk he'd tell someone else. And you murdered Michael Davis because he saw you and was blackmailing you. Really? And how is it that they found Paddy Whelan's fingerprints on the murder weapon? That's one of the things that gave you away. I remember that you kept the glass with Paddy's fingerprints on it. You said you liked my work. And I saw my book, The Zero Aspect, on the bookshelf in your office. In that novel, the murderer used adhesive tape to transfer the fingerprints of an innocent person onto the murder weapon. And I did all that because I wanted the treasure? No. Not only that. Mostly for revenge. You're "The Lost Boy." I think you're Rose MacRoth's son. What an extraordinary idea. I don't even know who Rose MacRoth is. I think you do. I think that's why you keep that souvenir of Connemara in your desk. Kitty Murphy told me that Rose's son was born in Connemara. That's pure coincidence. I told you that was given to me. By Nora. She was Rose's sister. You got her the job with the Byrnes. That's nonsense. I told you, she was already here when I came to Ballymure. But that isn't true. I have a letter from the employment agency dated at least a year after you joined the firm. I suspect that your fingerprints are on that letter, and the name of the agency, which doesn't exist, by the way, is Marchot, which is an anagram of MacRoth. You may have figured this out, Jessica. But no one will believe you. I think they will, when I tell them that you put Nora into the household because you thought she could be useful in watching the family. But then... Yes, poor Aunt Nora. I soon realized that she was something of a liability and tried to scare her into silence, but once she found about... About the murders. You lured her to the churchyard, and murdered her. Just in time, too. She'd have told you everything. Charles, there's no point in that. Inspector O'Dwyer knows that I'm here. But he doesn't know that I am. "The Lost Boy." It sounds quite romantic, doesn't it? Believe me, when your adoptive father is an abusive drunk, and the woman you've been told to call your mother is cold and unfeeling, you have plenty of time to plan revenge. And that's what I did. On Eamon Byrne, the father who abandoned me. I planned to take it all away from him, and leave them with nothing. And with some careful manipulation of the books, I did it. I'm only sorry that Eamon didn't live to see it. Step over there, please. MAN: Hold it right there! CHARLES: Wait! Put him in the car. Mrs. Fletcher, you all right? Yes, I'll be fine. Thank God you arrived. Well, after last time, I left instructions that any message from you must be passed on to me immediately, night or day. Excuse me, Madam, does this belong to you? Thank you, I'll take it. It belongs to the Byrne family. JESSICA: Oh, Breeta, I'm so glad I got to know you. BREETA: if I had one wish, only one, I wish you could come to our wedding, Jessica. Oh, so do I. I couldn't be happier for both of you. I'm happy for you too, Breeta. I never would have thought it would happen. It would really pleased Da. It would give me the greatest pleasure, if you would accept Rose Cottage as my wedding present to you. Oh, Jessica, you are wonderful. Do you know that? Thank you so much for that. Thank you for everything. God bless you, Jessica. Thank you. Thank you very much. You're very welcome. Isn't it time we had a look at the treasure? I think Jessica should unwrap it. FIONA: Yes, good idea. Well, if you're sure. (GASPS) Nuada's Silver Arm. Geez, it must be a 1,000 years old. It may be old but it's beautiful. How much do you think that's worth? Look, Breeta, here's a Celtic inscription. It says, "Happiness comes to all those who cherish others." Oh... Here we are. Breeta. Oh, thanks, Paddy. Here you go, Jessica. Here's to the memory of Eamon Byrne, who did indeed cherish his family, and who made the most of his second chance. Ay. ALL: Eamon!
