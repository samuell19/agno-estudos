Nice shooting, Creever. Well, I couldn't miss, sir. He was coming right at me. Pakawa didn't miss, either. I'd better get that out of there, for you, sir. I sure wish I had a drink of whiskey for you, sir. No, Creever! No, it's in too deep. You'd better break off the shaft and get me back to the fort. Doctor Gibson can dig out the head. Doctor Gibson? Well, all right, sir, if that's the way you want it. Draw sabers. We got Pakawa, sir, but Major Vandergrift got wounded in the leg. One... Now then, hold him steady, soldier. Doc, you sure you're all right? Sure, I'm sure. Don't joggle him so. Incision. Clamp. You see, soldier? Yeah, yeah, I see it. One little pull. There she is. Doc, the blood! Linens, quickly! Hello, Creever. Have any trouble with Pakawa? A little, sir. Major Vandergrift, in the leg. Van! Where is he? -The doctor's operating. -Operating! Doc, you've got to stop it! Linens, more linens, quickly! -Gibson! What's the matter? -It's the femoral artery. I can't locate it. It won't stop bleeding, sir! It was unavoidable, I swear. You butcher! You murdering butcher! -Captain Blake! Captain Blake! Stop it! He murdered Van! -That's not true! -I'll report him for this, Colonel. Get to your quarters. So with all respect, sir, I must state that you have compelled me to entrust the lives and the health of my command to the incompetents, the drunkards and the misfits that have been assigned to me by the Army Medical Department. I urge you to send better surgeons than the last three we've had, or none at all. Send that to the Surgeon General, Washington, D.C. Straighten up there. Creever. I want those supplies put in the wagons just as soon as the train pulls in. Yes, sir. We want to get a good start to the fort before sundown with those new rifles. We'll have 'em loaded, sir, before you can say George Armstrong Custer. Hey, it's running a little early today. Only two and a half hours late. My, they give you a real reception out west, don't they? Funny, they've never run after me like that before. Shows how they've missed you, Aunt Martha. -Nice to have you back. -Thank you, Peter. It's good to be back. -How's Ethan? -The Colonel's fine, ma'am. Says he can hardly wait to see you and Miss uh... All right, all right, just control yourselves, I'll introduce everybody. Miss Laurie MacKaye, Captain Peter Blake. -Welcome to the west, Miss MacKaye. -Thank you, Captain. And Lieutenants Raymond and Finlay. -How do you do, ma'am? -Howdy, ma'am. My, what handsome officers. Miss MacKaye, I've got three hundred and five dollars and two saddles and a brace of dueling pistols my grandpa left me. I know this ain't much to get married on, but uh... -What? -Don't take his proposal too seriously, Miss MacKaye, at least until you've considered mine. My goodness, you too? I'm the reserved type. I'm waiting for a moonlight night. Are they all like this, Aunt Martha? It's the heat, I think. Just ignore them. Ignore them? What a vacation I'm going to have. That's what I'm afraid of. But you haven't met the handsomest one of them all. Didn't Van come with you? What's the matter? He's all right, isn't he? No, he's dead. But how did it happen? A renegade Kiowa, Mrs. Walters. Major Vandergrift got an arrow in his leg. In his leg? Yes, and Dr. Gibson did the rest. I'm beggin' your pardon, sir, the supplies are loaded. Thank you, Creever. This way, ladies. -Excuse me, are you from Fort McCulloch? -Yes. I'm the new post surgeon, Dr. Seward. I was wondering about transportation. Right behind you, back to wherever you came from. -Peter! -We met Dr. Seward on the train. -Oh? -He wasn't very sociable, -but he's quite a good doctor, I think. -Thank you. I fainted from the heat, and he took the proper steps. A difficult case. My orders are to report to the commanding officer at Fort McCulloch. Orders? What orders? A Lieutenant. So now they're handing out commissions. Very well, Lieutenant. Do you have a uniform? Yes, I had it made in New York. Creever. See that Lieutenant Seward is in uniform and back in five minutes. -Yes, sir. -Then get him a mount. You can ride, can't you? Well, I... Well, you'll have to unless you want to walk sixty miles. This way, ladies. This way, sir. That wasn't exactly a rousing welcome. Oh-oh, well, you mustn't blame the captain too much, sir. It's very disappointing, sir. What's disappointing, Sergeant? Well, I hoped that perhaps maybe you might have some of the more valuable medicines with you, sir. Like some rare old Irish whiskey, for example. I'm afraid I didn't bring any whiskey, Sergeant, but... I might order some. -What's it needed for chiefly? -Uh... Sunstroke, sir. And for the chill that comes in the night in the desert. You know, this is a fearful unpleasant climate out here, sir. -It's a deadly climate. -Is that so? Is the death rate pretty high? Well, same as it is back east, one to a person. Well, if you have your uniform on, sir, we... Is... Is it all right? Well, it's dazzlin', sir. Frankly, it's the first time I've ever worn it, and I feel a little silly somehow. Yes. Well... I think it might be better, sir, if you walked out behind me. Left by twos. March ho! What kind of Indians do you have out here, Sergeant? Kiowa, sir. Although, every now and then some wanderin' Comanches ride through, just to prove their manhood. But Kiowas mostly. Old Satanta's reservation is only a few miles from the post. Oh, I see. Then they're all on a reservation. Yes, sir. One mile of land for every five square Indians. Well, Sergeant, does that mean they're all tamed? Tamed, is it? Well... Sir, you would never say that if you'd ever campaigned against 'em. It took one of the toughest winters in fifty years to get 'em out. Starved, half frozen. - Company. - Company. Halt! - Prepare to dismount! - Prepare to dismount! Dismount! Where are your sidearms, mister? I didn't think surgeons were supposed to carry arms, Captain, according to regulations. Redskins don't observe the rules of war, mister. In fact, they've never heard of them. Sergeant, pistol, cartridge belt and carbine for Lieutenant Seward. -And you might show him how to use 'em. -Yes, sir. -Are you ladies comfortable? -Is anything ever comfortable in the army? Every bone in my bustle is bruised. And you, Miss MacKaye? I'm quite comfortable, thank you, just lonesome. Can't you ride with us, Captain? I'd like to, but I'm afraid it would make me unpopular with Finlay and Raymond. And if either of them rode with you, he'd be unpopular with me. Oh. Well, how about Dr. Seward then? He's unpopular already. I'll speak to him at once, ma'am. Like this. Yes, sir. Haven't done much riding, have you, Doctor? After today I will have. Still twenty more miles before we make camp. And twenty more tomorrow before we reach Fort McCulloch. Maybe you'd prefer to ride in the ambulance with the ladies? Miss MacKaye has taken pity on you. She invites you to join her. Thank her, but I'm finding this quite an experience. I could make it an order, Lieutenant. Yes, you could, Captain, but you won't. Because you've got too much of a dislike for doctors. I guess I do, mister. You might as well know it. Your predecessor was a drunkard, the one before him, a drug addict, and before him, a sadistic butcher who was never happy unless he had a knife in his hand. Gives a man something to live up to, doesn't it? Now they send us schoolboys. -Prepare to mount! -Prepare to mount. Mount! Forward! -Forward! -Ho! I'll bet his bustle'll be bruised. ♪♪ The other night while I was sparking Sweet Turlina Spray ♪♪ The more we whisper'd our love talking The more we had to say ♪♪ The old folks and the little folks... ♪♪ A woman's voice, there's nothin' more heart-warmin', is there, sir?

Who fired that shot? Sentries report! Post number one, all's well. Post number two, all's well. Post number four, all's well. -Post number three, report. -That's Creever. The trouble is at the wagon, sir. -What happened? -I don't know exactly. I heard something. I saw some people moving around. People? You mean Indians? -They were Indians, all right. -Were they Kiowas? -How should I know? -Well, how many of them were there? I don't know. It didn't seem like many at first, then I got up to investigate and then... Investigate! Who asked you to investigate? -It all happened so fast. -Why didn't you give the alarm at once? And why don't you stop shouting? At least I wasn't leading a community sing! Creever! Where's Creever? He's over here, sir. -Check the supplies. -Yes, sir. Are you all right, Dr. Seward? Why, yes. It's nice to have someone ask. He's got a bad cut. Even I can see that, Doctor. Captain, they got away with ten of the new repeaters and four boxes of cartridges. -Ten repeating rifles! -Yes, sir. Have the men saddle up at once, Mr. Raymond. Are we going after them, tonight? -We're getting to the fort as fast as we can. -Yes, sir. Just a minute, Captain. This man may have a fracture. -Can you move your left arm? -Yes. All right, now see if you can wiggle your fingers. You mean like that, sir. Well, there's no sign of a fracture. I think he'll be all right. How are you feeling, Creever? Oh, is that you, sir? Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine. Take more than an Indian ax to put you away. -Step to it, Mr. Raymond. -Yes, sir. I'm sorry, ladies, but I'm afraid you won't be getting much sleep tonight. And until we get those rifles back, there won't be much sleep for any of us. Sound assembly. Well, he shouldn't wake up until we reach the fort. -I'm sorry about Sergeant Creever. -Oh, he'll be all right. I'm sure he will. It's just that... Well, this is the first time a man had to be hit over the head before another man would ride with me. -Did you arrange that? -Well, no. But the fates must have taken pity on me. I've never seen a man so wrapped up in his work. Five days on the same train, and you never took your nose out of your medical books, until I fainted. That was something you did arrange, wasn't it? Yes. Well, things should be better for you now. You're among men who've been in their jobs longer. They can relax and notice a pretty girl. Oh, so you did notice. Oh, is there anything we can do? Not a thing. He's just dreaming of those Indians. You'd better try and get a little rest. Doctor's orders? Let's say recommendations. Good night, Doctor. Good night. "G" troop returning. Ho! Four men! - Martha, dear. - Ethan, darling. -Who's that, Captain? -Creever, sir. Nothing serious. Laurie. -Easy, men. -This way, Doctor. Don't they ever air this place? Put him down on that. Where are the rest of the supplies? As far as I know, this is it. Doc Gibson never used much except calomel, croton oil, quinine and whiskey. Mostly whiskey. -I'll get my own bag. -I'll fetch it for you, sir. Thank you. -How's the head, Creever? -Well, now, sir, I know it's still there. But now, if I just had a little nip of the right stuff, sir, -it would give me that... -It would give you a real headache. The colonel's compliments, sir. Would Dr. Seward report to headquarters at once. Tell him I'll be there as soon as I can. -But, sir... -Here you are, sir. Thank you. The colonel wants to see you, and he said at once. I heard you. Pardon me. Uh... I'll explain to the colonel. It's good to have a doctor on the post, Doctor. They could just as easily be Comanches. I'm certain they were Kiowas, sir. Probably knew we were going for supplies, waited their chance, hit, hightailed it back to the reservation. Well, if they were Kiowas, they're more apt to be off in the hills somewhere. The head count'll tell us who's missing, sir. Hmm, maybe. - Dr. Seward, sir. - Oh, come in, Doctor. This is Lieutenant Seward, the new surgeon. Colonel Walters. -How do you do, sir. -Welcome to Fort McCulloch, Doctor. Your first experience in the army? Yes, sir. I have my orders here, sir. Sorry to keep waiting, but Sergeant Creever is in... Yes, so Mr. Raymond explained. How is Creever? Well, I'll have to keep him under observation for a few days. Sir, that hospital, it's filthy. The last doctor liked it that way. -Well, I don't, sir. -I'm glad to hear it. -Would you like some coffee, Doctor. -Yes, thank you. Dr. Seward was so wonderful, the way he discovered those Indians. If it hadn't been for him, we might have all been killed. All they wanted was to steal some rifles, which they did. Oh, you were wonderful too, Captain. The way you ordered everyone around. Doctor, do you think you could possibly identify any of the Indians on that raiding party? It would be mighty helpful if you could. Well, I don't know. I didn't see them too clearly, sir. But if you saw some Kiowas, couldn't you at least tell whether they were dressed the same? I don't know, I might. -Assemble the troop, Captain. -Yes, sir. You'd better finish your coffee. I want you to ride out to the reservation with Captain Blake. Ride, sir? Does he have to ride again, so soon? And I'd suggest you change into something more appropriate for riding. Yes, sir. Ho! Prepare to dismount. - Prepare to dismount. - Dismount. Round 'em up, Sergeant! Bucks, squaws, every last one of 'em. -Search those tepees! -Yes, sir. Get that scared look off your face, mister. It's bad policy. Stay close to me. Make them step lively over there. Use your carbines. Come on. Keep moving. Keep moving. Treating 'em a little rough, aren't you, Captain? I know my business, Doctor. All right, you, move. Hurry it up. Move on. All right, all right. Keep moving. Why do soldiers come here? What do they want? You know what I want, Satanta, ten carbines. Hey, you there, move on! Ten like these, stolen from our camp last night. -Comanche maybe. Not Kiowa. -I say Kiowa! You'll save yourself time and trouble by turning them in now. -No rifles. -All right. You've had your chance. They're all lined up, sir. Come on, Doctor. No one's going to hurt you. This boy is sick. Your son? Sick, you understand? That's no concern of ours, Doctor! Over here. -Come along. -All right, move. We'll go right down the line. Well... They just don't look the same somehow. As I said, I didn't see much, except their moccasins. Well, are they the same? My father tells me you've come for rifles. These are the rifles of the Kiowa. Where have you been, Red Leaf? The soldier chief knows everything. -Why he ask me? -I don't have to, I know. Look at your horses. You've ridden a long way. Yes! Hunting so our people can eat. In the south, maybe, where we camped last night? Doctor, take a good look at these rabbit-hunters. How about that headband? Or the scar? -Or this amulet? -No touch! Don't let that scowl frighten you, Doctor. Take a good look. I just don't know, that's all. All right, Doctor. Nothing except this one old buffalo gun, it's rusty at that. Now, no one's going to hurt you. A high fever. How long has he been like this? -Evil spirit enter him. -I only wish I'd brought my medicine. Medicine man, you? You too? I'm Dr. Seward. Isatai. I know it's not very ethical to interfere in another doctor's practice, but it looks to me as if your patient has a case of malaria. Mal-ar-i-a? I'm afraid so. I haven't any quinine with me, but... I'd like to suggest that you keep him on liquids. Hot soup. No eat. Starve out evil spirit. Of course, that's one school of thought, starve a fever. But what I was thinking... If you could make him a good strong soup out of one of those rabbits, it might help. You understand English, don't you? Talk English? My name, Seward. Your name? Manyi-ten. Mr. Seward. I'll be right with you. Manyi-ten. Your son? Mr. Seward, we're moving out! He's a fine boy. I hope you'll do as I said. It's not your job to wet-nurse the enemy, Doctor. I'd hardly call a little boy the enemy, Captain. - Column of two. - Column of two. - Forward. - Forward. Hooo! Captain Blake. That boy's mother, Red Leaf's wife, did anything about her strike you as being funny? No Kiowa strikes me as funny, mister. -Well, that's just it. Is she a Kiowa? -Maybe not. Kiowas took all kinds of captives, Comanches, Apaches, Sioux, Arapaho, raised 'em as their own. What of it? Well, what others did they take? What do you mean? She's lighter than the rest. She's got good features. And I'll swear she understood every word I said. She's a Kiowa squaw, mister. That's all I want to know about her. I'd advise you to forget it. -Well, how do you like it, Creever? -Well, it's a joy to see the old hospital looking so clean that a man wouldn't die of shock the minute he's brought into it. Oh! Is your head still bothering you? Uh, no, sir. No, it's not my head, sir, it's me jaw. Well, let's take a look at it. Oh, sir. I got a bad tooth and it's killin' me. You know, my father in Ireland, sir, he had the greatest cure for this kind of thing. Oh, he did? Well, I'd like to know about it. Well, if you just have a little medicinal whiskey to hold against the aching tooth, the pain goes right away. That's interesting. Medicinal whiskey, huh? Oh, it's... -Is that about right? -Well, it's a mighty big tooth, sir. -Here you are. -Ah, thank you, sir. You hold it against the tooth, is that it? Yes, sir. You shouldn't have done that, Doctor. I swallowed it. -I'm sorry, Creever. -Well, that's all right. Here. -Now, what are you doing here? -You swallowed it again? I couldn't help myself, sir. I swear it. -Well, maybe you couldn't. -Now, if I could just have one more, sir. -You really think it'll work this time? -Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Maybe we'd better pull it. Uh, no, no, no, sir. Huh. -The whiskey is all I'll need, sir. -Are you sure? Well, I told you about my father in Ireland. He never had a bad tooth in his head, sir. As a matter of fact, there wasn't a bad tooth in the entire house. He should have been a dentist. Yes, sir. This is the last one you can have, Creever. -I've got to save a little for emergencies. -Uh... You'd better say goodbye now, so you won't forget again. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Goodbye, Doctor. What can I do for you, Maria? -Isatai want you come. -Isatai? -My people sick. -Oh. -Are they very sick? -Yes. Young, old, many sick. -Satanta, Red Leaf. -Red Leaf too? And Isatai wants me to come. Manyi-ten tell him send for you. Oh, Manyi-ten. She insisted on sending for the white doctor, is that it? Tell me the truth, isn't Manyi-ten white? -Manyi-ten Kiowa! -All right. I'll have to speak to the colonel. He'll want to send a patrol. Isatai say you come alone. No soldiers. But I can't, Maria. The colonel's given us orders that no one is to go near the reservation. I say you not come. Wait. Wait a minute, Maria. Tell Manyi-ten... No, I'll tell her myself. I'll go. -Good morning, Doctor. -Good morning, Miss MacKaye. I don't ever recall meeting a man whose time was more completely taken up with other things whenever I'm around. Can't help it. A doctor on a military post seems to be a combination of surgeon, dentist and veterinarian. My uncle's very pleased with you. -He is? -Hmm-hmmm. -But I'm not. -You're not? -I'm sorry to hear it. -Are you, really? Could I ask you a personal question? Well, that depends. How personal? Well, fairly personal, I'm afraid. Why did you come out here? To practice medicine. Well, couldn't you have done that in New York? I might have. But it's not as easy as you think to build up a practice. Is that the only reason? The army offered me a chance to practice medicine for three years, which was just what I wanted. So I took it and I'm grateful. Well, I guess my hunch was wrong. I thought maybe there was a girl back home. There were plenty of girls, but no one girl. -And you? -There were plenty of men. But no one man. Seems to be the same story here, with Raymond and Finlay and Blake and the rest of the officers. But you're not doing your part. It's your turn to take me riding today. Riding! Yes. You're in the cavalry, aren't you? Yes, I am. But... I can't say that I really enjoy it yet. You'd better go with one of the other officers. I'll go with Captain Blake. He loves horseback riding. It serves him right. Goodbye, Doctor. Enjoy your ride. If you don't, my professional services are always available. It's amazing how far you can see from a little hill like this. It takes a bit of getting used to, after you've lived back east. -Yes. -It must be pretty dull for you here. -No, it isn't. I love it. -You do? Of course. I'm the center of attention of four attractive men. I wish you could think of me as an individual, and not just one of a quartette. Don't I go riding with you more than anybody? Yes, but if Dr. Seward liked to ride, it'd be different. That's not so at all. He begged me to go riding with him today, and I wouldn't. I'm surprised at Seward. He's really developed a taste for riding, has he? Oh, not, he still loathes it. He said if I didn't go with him, nothing in the world would induce him to... Who's that? -It's Seward! -Dr. Seward? It can't be! It is, though. I guess he has developed a taste for riding. -Straight toward the reservation. -To the Indians? -That's dangerous, isn't it? -Yes. Dangerous and against orders until those rifles are found. I'll have to go after him. Will you go back and explain to the Colonel why I'm disobeying orders? I will, right away. I'm looking for Manyi-ten. Manyi-ten not here. You go. Isatai! Well, I guess doctors even get sick sometimes, don't they? Something people forget. I have made strong medicine. Try drive out fire from body, but... Maybe if we put our medicines together. Ah. If my medicine not work... He's got malaria, all right. And he's got it bad. We'll have to get some quinine into him. -No! No! -I'll need a cup of water. No! No! No! -Thank you. -No! No! Spotted Wolf. No! No! No! No! Tanta, tanta, tanta! Tanta? Wait! I take your medicine. And then maybe my people take too. Tell me, what does "Tanta" mean? Tanta. White. Thanks. I know what "Tanta" means now. And I think I know what he meant back there. He was saying he doesn't trust me because I am white. And that he doesn't trust you for the same reason. You've understood every word I've said. Your name isn't Manyi-ten. What is it? My parents called me Theresa. They drowned crossing the Arkansas. Now I am Manyi-ten, wife of Red Leaf, daughter of Satanta, Chief of Kiowas. You help my people when they are sick. I wish I could have done more. My people not want to live here. Once they were free and happy. Now here in this place, they grow pale and die. Long time ago, this land belonged to our fathers. Now when I go up to the river, I see only camp of white soldiers. They cut down our trees, kill our buffalo. And when I see this, my heart feels like bursting. I feel sorry. You feel the same, don't you? But these are not your people. The little fella's not much better. How many are sick? Twenty-two. Two already die. Is that your only water supply? Yes. Up there, in high country, is good water. Is that where the Kiowas used to go in the summer? Yes. We don't know what causes malaria, but we do know that it's not common on high ground. You've got to get away from this place. Are you telling these people to move, Doctor? You're really trying to make trouble, aren't you? Please get some water. No. I'm trying to undo some of the trouble you've made, or whoever's responsible for making them come here. We won't argue about that now, Doctor. You've disobeyed orders by coming here. Let's go. Doctor, I said let's go. Now we'll fix you up, little fellow. I said, let's go, Doctor. It's going to be all right. Now, son, drink this. You're under arrest. Two people have already died of malaria here. Twenty-two more are sick. Would you mind not shooting me until after I've treated them? Manyi-ten. The little fellow will be all right now. Red Leaf very sick. Comanches! Well, mister, how do you like Indians now? It's quite a report, Doctor. Thank you, sir. If anybody can catch those bronco Comanches, Blake can. I'm sure he'll find them, Ethan. At least we know who's got the rifles. Now we have a malaria epidemic right on our doorstep. I hope I can check it, sir. Doctor, I'm going to have to ask you not to go out to the reservation again. Why not? Why not? Because I'm giving you an order, and this time I want it obeyed! I've got all our lives to think of, the men, their wives and their children. I can't have you bringing a Kiowa sickness in here. Kiowa sickness! They'd never be sick at all if they hadn't been ordered to stay where they are. Well, maybe, maybe not. Your report will go to Washington. But, sir, that'll take months. That's right, Doctor, so it will. Until then, I have my orders, and so have you. I'm sorry, sir, but I can't obey them. Allen! You can't obey my orders. I expected orders when I went into the army, but not to withhold treatment from the sick. Lieutenant Seward, you're confined to your quarters, pending investigation. - Sergeant! - Yes, sir. Take Mr. Seward to his quarters. Colonel Walters, -are you going to let the white girl die too? -White girl? -I told you her story. -I've heard other stories like it. She made her choice. She's a Kiowa squaw. Not now, sir. Her husband's dead. She's still a squaw. Once they've had an Indian's baby, they're Indian. She'll follow the custom and marry her dead husband's brother, Spotted Wolf. She will? When? As soon as the period of mourning is over. - I see. - Doctor... You're not interested in this girl, are you? Yes, I'm interested in her. I'm interested in any human being in trouble. If she wanted to come back, that would be different, of course. Does she? No, but... Laurie, you agree with me. I don't know. I don't quite see why you're so concerned. I sure hate to tell the old man we couldn't find those Comanches. After a day's rest in the fort, we'll go out again. Yes, sir. Mister, those ten repeating rifles can mean a hundred lives. -There's no smoke from the Kiowa camp. -Sir, you're right. It's as cold as a corpse. They've been gone at least a day, maybe two. -You sent for me, Colonel? -Yes. Thanks to you, the Kiowas have jumped the reservation. -Is that so, sir? -You're to blame for it! You put this crazy bug in their heads. This nonsense about the high country. Do you deny it? I don't wish to deny it, sir. I only hope that following my advice will help save some of their lives. Some of their lives! Mr. Seward, it's taken us years to get those Kiowas settled down on a reservation where we could watch them. And you've undone this in a few days. It's going to cost the lives of my soldiers, I don't know how many, before I can get them back. -Sir, those people belong in the high country. -High country! You'll find out about the high country, and you'll find out what it means to go out on a fighting patrol. They must really be pushing hard. Comanches. It sure is! Kiowas will have to wait. Right now our job is to get those ten rifles back. You take half the troop, come in on them from the other side. When they see you, they'll hightail it back to where they came. That's where we'll be waiting for them. -Good luck, Lieutenant. -Yes, sir. Kiowas! They've joined forces with the Comanches. They've got Raymond in a trap. Kiowas! Kiowas! Doctor! Over here. There were more Indians than we counted on, Captain. I'm glad we've got a doctor on the post. Doctor... I suppose now we chase Kiowas some more. Now we'll go back with our wounded. And dead. Detail forward to help the wounded. Easy men. Help them down. Let me help you. Lay off of me, mister. I don't want no help from a wood-hawk. Take care of that one over there. Into the hospital. Never mind, Doc. You put me here, I'll get out by myself. Take this, you'll feel better. You heard what he said, Doc. He don't want any help from a wood-hawk. What's all this about a wood-hawk? A wood-hawk's a bird that turns on his own kind. Yeah, Doc, a renegade. Miss MacKaye, would you please give these men their medicine? -He told 'em to bring us here. -Kiowa lover! If it wasn't for him we wouldn't be here. -Wood-hawk! -Wood-hawk! - Wood-hawk! - Yeah, that's him, Dr. Wood-hawk! Allen, they're so unfair. Come in. What is it, Maria? Say what you like, it's all right. You go with me. Why, I can't leave. There are soldiers at the door. Manyi-ten want you. Manyi-ten! Where is she? Outside. You meet me by window. I show you. Did you hear that, Laurie? She's left the Kiowas. She's come back to her own people. -But how do you know? -She's here, isn't she? Maria, you go and I'll meet you. Allen! You're not going to her? -Of course I am. -But you can't leave, they'll court-martial you. Laurie, this girl ran away and came back here because I urged her to. Now I've got to help her. Don't you understand? Yes, I suppose I do. I'm glad you've decided to come back to us. -No! -What's the matter? You helped me before. You gave me warning to leave place where I was or die. -Yes. -Now I give you warning. Leave this place, quick. But why? Now Kiowas and Comanches join together. They declare war. They attack. They kill you. Go. Go away. -Now, Doctor, just because some Indian girl tries to... -White girl, sir. Tries to scare you with a ridiculous story that... I'm sure she's telling the truth. You've got to believe me. There's going to be an attack. -Colonel Walters. -What is it, Blake? Sorry to interrupt, sir, but the sentries have captured a Kiowa girl. Bring her in. -This the girl you were talking about? -Yes, sir. -What's your name? -Manyi-ten. -Your people? -Kiowa. -I'm daughter of Satanta, the chief. -Mmm-hmm. -Manyi-ten... -Mr. Seward, I'm questioning this girl! Yes, sir. Did you tell Mr. Seward the Kiowas were going to attack? Have you anything to say? Put her under guard. Send Creever on a patrol. If there's anything big building up, -he should find some evidence of it. -Yes, sir. As for you, I suppose I'll have to put up with your interference until your replacement arrives. You are dismissed, Doctor! -No sign of the patrol yet? -No, not yet, sir. Colonel Walters! Captain Blake! It's the patrol, sir, making a run for it! First and second squads to the main gate! Get some men over to the unit. "B" and "C" troops, get up on top of the building. - Finlay! - Open the gates! Get that gate closed. Dismount. Fight on foot! Ammunition, here! Finlay! Get over and get that gate closed! Bringing in another wounded man, Doctor. You all right? Yeah. They're coming in now. Put him down in there. I'm sorry. I just got a little dizzy. Just take it easy, Finlay. Who took their weapons? What's been done with them? I think they've been returned to the barracks, sir. I want every man's pistol and carbine by his side at all times. -Get them. -Yes, sir. Now you men listen. I don't care how sick you are, when that attack comes, you'll man your posts somehow. And at the word fire, you'll fire, even if you can't see anything but the spots before your eyes! We can't let 'em know that half our men are down with malaria. Or the next time there'll be no stopping them. Captain, these men can't fight off another attack. I know it and they know it. Maybe, somehow, we can bluff them. You see, Doctor, men have got to hope for something, even when in their hearts they know they're going to die. Their families are going to die because you disobeyed orders. Because I disobeyed orders. Allen. All you were trying to do was save lives. I know that isn't wrong. In this world, I guess it is wrong. You can't believe that and be a doctor. Does it matter if I'm a doctor or not? Allen! The important thing is I'm a wood-hawk. I disobeyed orders. I turned against my own kind. Your own kind is the human race. Just because they don't seem to realize it doesn't make you wrong. Don't... Don't change, Allen. Don't let them change you. The medicine man, Isatai, did he get well? Then I must talk to him. I must show him the mistake his people would be making. They listen to him, don't they? Sometimes. -I'll have to take the chance. -Wait! Give to Spotted Wolf. He will know you come as a friend. Thanks. Who rode out? Who was it? -That wood-hawk, sir! -Seward! Ridin' to the Indian camp, sir. If he tells them we've got malaria... -I could have put a bullet in his back. -I wish you had! Open those gates. May I talk to you? They say that Dr. Seward has deserted. I saw him come in here. Do you know why he left? He go to Isatai. He thinks he can talk to Kiowas to make peace. I knew it! I knew he wasn't deserting. Do you think they'll listen to him? No. You don't? And you don't care! It doesn't matter much to you, does it? He may be killed. And when your people attack, we'll all be killed. Except you! I hope they will not attack. Are you sure of that? I hope Dr. Seward will come back safe. I'm a friend of the Kiowa. Take me to Isatai. Isatai! Isatai? Kiowas want war now. Not peace. But we don't want war, Doctor. We're not killers, you and I. It's our job to preserve life, not take it. -Too late now. -But you'll be saving your people. Kiowa people want war now. It will do you no good to kill white men. Others will come, many others. You cannot stop them. You're brave men, all of you, Kiowas and Comanches, but you can only do yourselves harm if you go on with this war. But if you will go away and do no more killing... He came as a spy. No! He came in peace. He is not our friend. He must die! Spotted Wolf, I am your friend. Manyi-ten sent this. Manyi-ten. They're coming, sir. Bugler, sound arms! Creever! Finlay, get some men over to stable gate. All right, men, come on now, all of you, out of here. Get to your posts. On the double. Small party of approaching, sir. - "B" Troop, up on the roof. - It's Seward! -I thought you shot him. -So did I. That's far enough, Mr. Seward! Wait here. All right, Doctor. What word do you bring from your Indian friends? I won't surrender, if that's what they want. That wouldn't do any good. Satanta's son is critically wounded. He has a bullet at the base of his brain. And you're afraid he'll die? Some of our men are in bad shape, too, Doctor. Aren't you worried about them? I'm worried about all of you. This whole thing's a trap, sir. He's told them our situation here and they've come to see for themselves. Colonel, we know what kind of a man this is. A traitor to his own people. All right, call me a renegade, a Kiowa lover, a man who can't be trusted, because I looked upon these people as human beings, and tried to help them. The only chance you've got to save your lives, all of your lives, is for me to save the life of this man. And the only reason you've got that chance is because some of them are convinced that I'm their friend. Are you going to let me operate and try to save him, or are you going to keep us talking until he dies? Suppose you operate and then he dies? Open the gate. Two men, bring him into the hospital. Allen, they told me you were... I'm going to need some help. Will you help me? Tell me what to do. They're sending for that girl, sir. -Manyi-ten? -Yes, sir. All right, go get her. -Alert the men. -Yes, sir. Creever, alert the men. Look lively now. Come on. White doctor help my people. Indians and soldiers, white doctor treat all alike, like brothers. Now he gives my only son's life back to me. I will not make war with you anymore. I will do everything in my power to see that you and your people live in peace in the high country. -Dr. Seward, sir. May I offer you my congratulations. -Thanks, Creever. -And may I add, that I think you're a very... -Uh, Creever, how's the toothache? Oh. Why it's... -Well, sir, now. -You know, I thought so. Wait for me in the hospital. There's an old Irish remedy I'd like to try. You're a great man, Doctor. You're a great man. Draw sabers. Present sabers.
