What's going on, honey? Are you OK? Hanging on... Let's do this, OK? Yes. We're in this together. - Don't fall apart on me, honey. Please. - No. No. Do it for him. Let's do this. - Chin up. - Yes. So, parents, grab your children and get into the bag with them. On my signal, move towards the goal line, me. So, no cheating. The first team that makes it all the way over there, wins. - Are you guys ready? - Yeah! - I can't hear you. Are you ready? - Yeah! OK, on your marks... Ready... - Come on! - Go for it! Hey, Andres. - Help me. - Where to? FIVE YEARS LATER - Are these yours? - No, it's that one over there. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Enjoy your vacation. - This one's open. - Enjoy your stay. - Is it OK? - Yes. Thank you. Goodbye. - You? - Take this. No, I'll take it. Nice, isn't it? - Can you manage? - Yes. This place is beautiful. Great. Isn't it? - How could you afford this? - Don't worry, honey. We're going to enjoy it. Let's see, Raton. Look at that. Do you like it? It's perfect. - I have to wake up Pedrito. - Why? - I promised him I would. - No. - He wanted to go for a swim. - We'll be here for a week. - I promised him. - No. No. Honey, please. Come on. Raton. We're here. Do you want to go for a swim? Raton? Do you want to go in the pool? Do you? Mommy. Mommy. I don't want to swim with these shoes anymore. That's OK, sweetheart. Leave them here. - What's wrong with his shoes? - They're uncomfortable. - Can you touch the bottom? - Yes. That's strange. Let's see. - Is it here? - Yes. Good evening. How can I help you? We want to know why you won't let this gentleman into his villa. I'm sorry. I don't even know these people. Well, this gentleman has a reservation. You shouldn't leave them outside getting bitten by mosquitoes. Well, I'm very sorry, but I have a reservation too. His wife thought someone had broken into the house. - Are you calling me a thief? - No, no, no. It's not that. It's just that I don't see your papers and he has his. My papers are inside, but look... here's my key. And here's mine. Well, that's weird. - Good evening. - Good evening. Is everything OK? Yes, Mr... What's your name? Sorry, I didn't hear your name. Bonilla. Abel Bonilla. It looks like Mr. Bonilla has a reservation here as well. There's obviously some kind of mix-up. Sorry to bother. But without papers, one can never be sure. - But you do have the papers, right? - Of course. The papers are inside. So, what should we do now? Come inside. There are loads of mosquitoes out here. We'll solve this. - We can just make a phone call. - Yes. You can leave your luggage here. It will be fine. No one's stealing it. Bring your bags in, kids. Excuse me. How about a shower? Do you want to stay here with Mommy? - Is it just him? - Yes, we only have one. - How old are you? - Go on, tell her. Were you asking me? I'm 30. You're really pretty. No one's picking up. What should we do? I told you, we don't have the authority to make any decisions. I see. Well, it's getting pretty late, so I think we should go to the front desk. Let's go. I'll be right back, hon. It won't take long, cutie pie. Watch the kids. Excuse us. Good night. Sir? - Sir? - Yes? Are you enrolled in our timeshare information seminar? Yes. So? Is there a problem? You too, sir? I'll take them to Moises. Follow me, please. Ma'am. Hey, you. They told us we had to sit by color. - Who said that? - The memo. Who is Memo? Hi, hello. Good evening. Good evening. Crew, this is your captain speaking. Let's show our new owners that we take organization seriously here at Vistamar. I'm very pleased to inform you that as of today, we'll be part of the Everfields International Resorts family. From now on, our mission is to make dreams come true. Before I move on, I would like to acknowledge two very special members of our team, who have inspired us all with their positive attitude. Dear Gloria, Andres, please stand up. Dear friends, your example... is an inspiration for our great future. Please, a round of applause to Gloria and Andres. - Our manager will be with you shortly. - OK. - Like some water? - No, it's fine. - Coffee? - Yes, please. - Right away. - Hey, what time is it? Of course. And I have more. I'll give them to you in a second. Good morning, Mr. Alvarez. Morning? Already? What time is it? May I offer you my sincere apologies on behalf of Everfields International for this shaky start to your vacation's experience. From now on, paradise is within reach. I have no idea what you just said. Could you fix the problem? Is he getting his own villa? Mr. Bonilla is completely satisfied with our arrangement. Good, I'm glad to hear it. I asked for coffee. Unfortunately, I can't share with you the terms of Mr. Abel's deal. - Really? Why? - It's a matter of confidentiality. It's fine. I only want to know how you'll get me the villa I paid for. We know that our customers use their rooms almost exclusively for sleeping. And your villa can fit two families. Well, I don't care if it fits 50 families. I paid for a private villa for my family. Do you have a napkin? Look, mister. I'm really tired. My flight was delayed two hours. The trip from the airport was exhausting. I want you to tell me what you'll do to get me the villa I paid for. The villa was practically free thanks to our generous offer... So what? Does that make me a second-class customer? Absolutely not, Mr. Alvarez. You deserve an international experience. Unfortunately, we don't have any vacancies. - Why? - Because our offer was a great success. You overbooked your rooms, Moises. - That's illegal. - It isn't if it's the result of success. And him? What did you offer him that made him so happy? Paradise. Are you making fun of me? Do I look stupid to you? Do I look like I'm in paradise? - Are you making fun of me? - Absolutely not... - Stop goofing around and solve this! - Mr. Alvarez, please. Show him. What's that? An agreement. You can trust us as if we were family. This has to be a joke. It can't be. Look, I only get one week off a year and you don't know how important this is to my family. I want to have the vacation I paid for today. And I'm not signing anything that lets you off the hook from your mistake. Nor anything that won't guarantee my family's privacy. May I offer you my sincere apologies on behalf of Everfields International. - Eva, what happened? - You startled me! What happened with the room? Why are they sleeping there? Can I make myself a cup of coffee? I'll try to find instant coffee. OK. So, what happened with the room? I don't know. What can I say? I felt bad. There's four of them. Their kids wouldn't fit on the sofa bed. - Besides, it's just for one night. - No, it's not only for a night. - What do you mean? - They're staying here. They overbooked the villa and they don't care that it's illegal. We have to share. - Want to go to another hotel? - There's none available. Everything's full and what's available is really expensive. It's the peak of the season. Besides, why should we leave? I paid for this. It is paid for. I have already paid. There's nothing else. I paid for it. Honey, it's OK. We'll just stay all day in the pool. Yeah. Thanks for taking it like this. In your stride. I would be much worse if it wasn't for you. It is what it is. There were nine others with me at the clinic. You get used to it. Besides, Raton really likes those kids. It'll be good for him. Are you crazy? We're not spending time with those people. - They're here. - And? Raton's IQ will drop. We'll keep it to the minimum. All that junk is how they got that idiot to sign the agreement. He signed a paper saying everything was OK because they gave him that crap. I'm getting a month for free. You'll see. How? - Why are you laughing? - Why? - It's not funny. - Why not? - Here you go, Sebas. - Everything OK? Yes. Peak season is starting. You know the saying, "Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today." Forget about "later." Do you want a balloon, Raton? - Welcome. Here you are, a balloon. - Thank you. Don't let go of it. Come here, son. All right, everybody, follow the instructor! Shall I tickle you? Everfields Vistamar! Turn around. Ready. Shall we go dancing? Very good. Excellent. What are you doing here, Andres? This seminar is invitation only. And you're making this hard for Gloria. - Do you understand what I'm saying? - Yes, of course. But there are many reasons I should be part of this seminar. I'm a hard worker. I do my job really well. I've been employee of the month 14 times... - Andres. - I'm a natural leader. - I do what I'm told. - I didn't make the call. Headquarters did. In Tucson, Arizona. I didn't have anything to do with it. I barely had a say. - Excuse me, what's that? - BBQ ribs, sir. Want mashed potatoes, Raton? Buddy! Buddy! We saved you some seats. - Don't even think about it. - Honey, they've already seen us. And there's nowhere else to sit. Do you want us to eat on our feet? OK, let's go, then. - Thank you. - Good afternoon. - Hi. - Did you sleep well? - Yeah. - Good. Didn't know there were waiters. I thought this was a buffet. This table is VIP, buddy, VIP. You guys are really smart. Look at my little Abelines, they're all burnt and red. I burnt my mouth. I'm gonna have to borrow that sunscreen, Evis. Of course, Sara. Whatever you need. We'll buy one after brunch, cutie pie. Don't worry about it. Good afternoon. Are you enjoying your complimentary brunch? - Yes! - Good. I want you to have a look at these brochures here. You can find all our destinations. The Everfields family has just got bigger, and we want you to be part of it so we can provide you with all the health and well-being you deserve. We can adapt to any life plan you require. So rest assured, our main goal is to share this paradise with you. So, give it a read, and I'm here if you have any questions. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Enjoy your meal. - Thank you. Buddy. I'm fine, thank you. Eva, you should have some more, you're so skinny. Have a steak, chicken makes you lose weight. I had a really big breakfast, so I'm not hungry. - So, what are you doing this afternoon? - The kids are going swimming. - They say there's a beautiful cenote. - Really? - We're going. Right, kids? - Dad, what's that? A cenote is a small lake that is inside the cave. - Can we go to the natural well? - Do you want to? I'm not sure, son. It is kind of dangerous and you're not a strong swimmer yet. We also have tickets for the water slide. We can skip the line. Cenote, cenote, cenote. Cenote, cenote, cenote. - Raton! Raton! - Cenote. Cenote. Cenote. Raton! Raton, stop it! Calm down, buddy. We're just playing around. How are you feeling? Fine. Better. I'm trying to stay positive all the time. I'm reading one of those books that help you see things in a positive light. I'm trying to do a good job and set an example. Especially for our new co-workers. I'm sure that I'll be lowering my dose soon. It is important that you don't stop your treatment. How are things at home? Good. Gloria, my wife, well, she's not very expressive. She is really happy with the American boss. How would you say you've performed since our previous evaluation? Well, I think... I'm doing everything I can... to adjust to all the changes. I mean, our new bosses. - Have you had any other visions? - No. I think this time, we found the right combination. How was your day? Good. The seminar is really good. I'm very tired. I could really use a vacation. I'm looking for one of those "international experiences." I know someone who's selling them. She can give me a discount. Keep dreaming. It's my opportunity. - It could be ours. - Why yours? What have you done to deserve it? They owe me. Nobody owes you anything. It's a new hotel. And that is done. Everfields only cares about the future. What about our future? Aren't we a family anymore? Can't you see that everything has changed? The hotel has changed. You have changed and so have I. He's gone. If you don't adapt, you'll be left behind. Pedro. Pedro. Pedro, quit it! Do you want me to ground you? What have I told you about running near the pool? I'm talking to you. Don't yell. This guy's really talented. Getting so far ahead in life and without parents. What happened to them? They died in a car crash when he was just a baby. Are you going to be here much longer? I'm really tired. Honey, can we finish watching this show? - I'll be outside. - Thank you, honey. EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH Right... - How was the pool? Very good, right? - But it was too crowded. It's always like that. But I saw you guys were in a private area. We had to make a reservation the day before. You should've come too. We found a good supermarket nearby. I mean, the prices were OK. Hey, buddy! What were you dreaming of? Good morning. Would you like some breakfast? Instant coffee, please. - How are you? - Fine. I just have a headache. - I don't want to stay with them anymore. - Don't be rude. - Rude? How? - They're here. So what? This vacation is just for us, hon. We came here to heal. They are ruining it. We're already sharing the villa. - Why be with them all day? - This is good for us. - How is it good for us? - Can't you see? - What? - Raton is really happy. - Pedro is happy everywhere. - It's nice having grown-ups I can talk to. Grown-ups? Please! What can you talk about with them? They're... - Please make an effort. - You don't think I've been doing that? Why don't you stay here today? Rest. Stop telling me what to do. I'm not the one who's sick. Daddy, can I swim in the pool? - You just had breakfast. - Please. Please. - Ask your mom. - Of course you can, honey. It took them long enough. Excuse me? It doesn't make sense for you to attend English classes. I saw your name on the list. - I just want to improve. - What for? I don't know. - I just don't want to lag behind. - We're a liability to them. Even if you learned Chinese, how long have you worked for this company? Down here? Four years, maybe less. You've been here in the gutter for a long time. You can't leave until you've become waste... or until you are spared. That's the only exit. Gloria. Gloria is already with them. And you know it. Follow me. - Where did you get this from? - Put it away. Quick. That's the key for you to give them all wrong numbers. Wrong numbers? All of this is a test before they come for real. They'll leave if they don't sell anything. Should I be scared? Shouldn't they be scared instead? Hey. Here. Welcome, guys. How are you? - I'm Sergio. - Nice to meet you. Oh, new aces. How are you? What's up? Hi. - How's it going? - How are you? - Hi, sweetie. How are you? - Fine. Awesome. So, let's warm up. Who here has played tennis before? Awesome. So, let's go to court number four and get started. OK, Champ. This is a drive. I lift my hand to the back of my head, I hit at the front and I put a scarf on. - Could you aim that closer to me? - You want it closer? What happened? Come on, son. You can do it. Come on, come on! What an asshole. I can't believe he is with her. Let's go. Great arm. Good job! You can do it, player. That's it. Amazing! Spectacular! Come on! Yes! - That's it. - Since when do you play tennis? I played for a while when I was 15. That's it. Spectacular! - Cool! - You never told me that. Very good! Very good! - Are you OK? - Yeah. - Go. - Are you OK? - Is everything OK? - Yeah. Good. Bravo! That's my boy! OK, beautiful. Good. A little higher. Very good! Next. Dude, remember, eyes on the ball. Focus. Hit it this time, OK? What's wrong with you? - What happened? - Could you hit it again, please? No. Next one, please. - The rules are the same for everyone. - But you're hitting wrong! - Do you want another shot? - Yes, please. - So, you're like an expert? - Smile, buddy! For Facebook. Let me see, hon. Move your hands. Calm down. It's OK, let me see. Pedro? Look at me. Please, call an ambulance! Easy, buddy. Calm down. Everything is fine. Where am I? Easy, easy now. Our families went home already. Such a shame. You really scared us. Why are you here? Why? Your wife fainted because you bled heavily. She wasn't of any use to you. It was better she went home. - Don't you think so? - Yes. Don't you worry, buddy. This is a first-class clinic. - Don Abel, nice to see you. - How are you, Doc? - Very good, and you? - How's my buddy doing? He broke his nose. Is this the first time he broke his nose? No. He broke his nose when he was a kid. He was 11. - How did you know? - It didn't heal properly. - Why? - He should rest as much as he can. And keep him out of the sun. Perfect. Will do. Anything else he might need? I'm giving him some pills. He should take one and a half in the morning and at night. Perfect. Is that it? Well, we're here if you need anything. - It's my pleasure to treat you. - See, buddy? Let's go home. Careful. Take it slowly. Slowly. Come on. Wait here, buddy. I'm getting your meds. We have to be silent, otherwise we'll wake them up. Not so loud. Be careful. - Oh, honey. - I'm OK, it's fine. It's not too bad. He's OK. - Did they give him something? - A sedative. Careful, buddy. Don't get too worried, sis. The doctor said it's not as bad as it looks. Is he going to need surgery? No, no, no. Not right now. We'll have to see later on. Right now, he needs to rest and stay out of the sun. Lay down. - Are you comfortable? - Yes. - I'm taking your shirt off. - No. I'm fine. - It's soaked in blood. - Doesn't matter. He really scared us all. - How much was it? - Don't you worry about it. We took care of the bill. That's what family's for. Enjoy. Relax. We'll swim in the sea after this. - We can't leave him alone, can we? - It's best for him. He needs to rest. If you lock yourselves up, he'll become very anxious. He's going to worry about you. Try to get some sleep. Don't worry, buddy. I'll make sure your wife and your Raton have a great time. Good night. Thank you very much. Good night. Sleep well. Not long ago, my husband and I suffered... - a terrible tragedy. - Good evening. Let's have a break. Pull yourself together and we'll start over. You have a really good story. Make it yours and it will be the best tool in your arsenal. I've been trying to overcome this for so many years. The best of us take our personal tragedies and turn them into opportunities for success. You are meant to be one of us. Shall we try it again? When my Rogelio went to heaven... my husband and I had many problems. We almost gave up, but... our family, the Vistamar family... The Everfields family. "The Everfields family." What's up? - Mommy, can we watch a film? - No, honey, Daddy is resting. - Please. - No, honey. I think Pedrito needs someone to play with. - Only children grow up spoiled. Twisted. - Yeah. - He's very lonely. - Lots of kids without siblings are fine. It's awful. How can everything collapse so quickly? Don't worry. It's just a broken nose. But if something were to happen to him, I would die! I don't know what Raton would do. We aren't worried, because our kids have each other. They keep each other company. Pedrito deserves that, having someone who'll always be with him. You still have time. The best gift you can give him is more children. A baby brother. There's nothing worse than being alone in this world. Yes, sis, but you're not alone. I mean, you have us. And I know we've just met, but... I don't know. There's something about this place that is like magic, isn't there? To us, you've become part of our family. - Abel. - I feel the same way, Evis. I'm fine, Eva. Don't worry. Thank you... for helping me heal. - Sis. - It's never too late, Eva. It's never too late. Pedrito. Sweetie. I need you to wake up. I have something to tell you. What's the matter? Don't worry, love. Everything's fine. I need you to listen, because I have something important to tell you, OK? You know I'm your dad, right? Abel and the rest, they're not our family. They're bad people. Do you remember that game we played? "Impostors"? That's who they are. They're bad people who want to break us apart. And you know that I love you very much, right? And you know that I'm never leaving you alone? And you know that I'll always be with you, right? Mom and I are your only family. That's it. Not them. OK? We have to be very smart, you and I. So they won't hurt us. I won the lottery! I won the lottery! It's mine! I'm a millionaire! I'm free and I'm a millionaire! It's mine! I won the lottery! PERSONAL FILE Hello. Who are you? I'm Andres. What's this? Who gave you this? Where did you get this from? Gloria, my wife. She works in sales. Your family is one of her targets. They only want to sell. No, this isn't right. My wife is sick. I lost her for a year. She was committed for a year. They can't use this information! At tonight's presentation, give them wrong numbers. It's all they care about. I'm not going to the presentation. I'm taking them away. I'm taking them with me. I'm taking them with me. But they have your family in their pocket. They will not leave willingly. If you take them away, they'll turn against you. And then you'll do anything to win them back. You'll buy a membership and then there's no turning back. And who are you? Andres who? Why are you doing this? I want to take something away from them so they see what it feels like. A great vacation always gives us memories of the time we spent with our family. But it's also an opportunity to inspire us on the path towards success. Our family is not offering you a villa. Our family is giving you the gift of inspiration. Please, close your eyes for a moment. Picture yourselves as the owner of one of our villas. Your wife is opening a bottle of wine from our cellar, and you toast with a picture-perfect sunset in the background while your children are happily playing in the pool, as they do every year. Focus on your heart. Can you feel your family's love? Open your eyes. That's what paradise feels like. And that's what Everfields is offering you. Unforgettable moments that inspire you to make your dreams come true. Any questions? Please. Thank you. Good evening, excuse me. I wanted to thank you for all these beautiful moments. We like to think that, in just a few days, our family has grown. Like my wife always says, "There's nothing in this world like a big happy family." So, thank you very much. Thank you, Abel. We also believe that. - Anyone else? - Me. I have something to say. Hello, darling. Are you OK? - Sit down. I have something to say. - Buddy. Hello. I don't have any questions, I just want to say something. Sit, sit. I just want to say that dreams don't come true in this place. Nightmares do. Nightmares come true here. Yes, nightmares. And this, my face, is not the worst thing that's happened to me in this place. - This is. - Me? - This is. - Pedro. This is the worst. This man wants to take my family away from me. He broke my nose. It was him, Eva. You put him in my villa, you did, and that's what happened. Thank you very much. - Please, let me be the first to apologize. - No, you're not the first to apologize. Everyone's been doing that, but they don't do anything. Nobody's done a thing. I'm truly sorry, I think this is a very unfortunate situation, but Mr. Bonilla had nothing to do... I'm sure that he had everything to do with it and that he is working for you. Mr. Bonilla is a pawn, working for you. He's a pawn who made his way into my villa to turn my family against me. And all because I wouldn't take your shitty deal. Mr. Alvarez, we're incapable of doing something like that! Really? And what's all this? My wife's clinical file. With private photographs. You followed us and you broke into my house. You violated my privacy. And you have pictures of us. These people treat us like their guinea pigs. - Honey, what are you talking about? - This! I told you! They're not our friends. They're trying to trick us. I told you. Here's the evidence, all of it. Don't listen to them and don't drink anything they give you. No, I trusted you once. I trusted this man and he mocked me. He mocked my rights as a customer. - I told you, Eva. I fucking told you! - Pedro! Pedro! You came here to heal. Do I look like I've healed? I know what it's like, struggling to heal. Look, my husband and I... saw our baby boy go to heaven. You don't know how hard it was. We felt very bad, I... I couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't even leave the house. But the Everfields family helped me. They picked us up and showed us that we could do it. We got back on our feet on the path to success to make your dreams come true. Let us become your family. We'll be there for you. Always. We're going to give you a home twice a year to protect you from all that is wrong outside. You, Eva and your Raton. We'll welcome all of you with open arms. Who do you think you are? Calling my son that? Talking about him like that? You know nothing about family! What is Andres to you? How is your husband doing? Is he even part of your family? - You know Andres? - Yes! You screwed him, just like me. You people fucked him. Made him crazy. You don't know what it's like. Carrying someone. Yes, I do! And you don't give up. You don't give up on your family. You stay. You stay right there, with your family. And you don't try to be someone else. This is not paradise. Not for me. Not for you. Buddy. Don't you recognize us? We're your family. Calm down. Have a drink. Buddy, what are you doing? Let me go! Let go of me! You're the devil, asshole. You're the devil! - You're the devil! Son of bitch! - Pedro, stop it! You're the devil! What's wrong with you? He's the devil. He's the devil. Why did you do it? It was my opportunity. I'm fed up. I can't stand you. You're not part of this family anymore. Eva. Hold it.
