APPLES Nice, before we move on to the next song... we've an announcement from the Disturbed Memory Department of the Neurological Hospital. It concerns the "New Identity" program. The program helps amnesiacs manage a new life, and takes place in two additional hospitals. Malou! Come here! -Good evening. -Good evening. Excuse me. Can you move your car? It's not my car. But you just came out of it. Me? Wait here, I'll call an ambulance. -Thank you. -Goodbye. Excuse me... Excuse me. It's the end of the line. Where were you supposed to get off? I don't remember. Where did you want to go? To... What's your name, do you remember? Wait here. Do you have anything in your pockets? A wallet or keys? Can you check the other pockets too? He has no ID or other documents. He is unidentified. 14840. Well done. 14841. Don't smile. We need them for identification. Well done. 14842. Come closer. In front of the camera. See where I'm standing? Look here. Look at the camera. Well done. 14843. Today, it is one week. -How did it happen to you? -I don't know. I was in a football field. Suddenly I saw people around me shouting about a goal. I don't remember how I got there. Only a game ticket was in my pocket. And you? I don't remember. I was found in a bus. Were you in pain? Suddenly I felt a sharp pain on my head. Here, in the middle. This apple is delicious. -Would you like mine as well? -Won't you eat it? Here you go. -You don't eat apples? -I don't remember if I like them. So... No. 14842 is without any signs. It happened suddenly to him, like the others. -But his results look clear. -So far, nobody has searched for him. He is unidentified. Unidentified. -Good morning. -Good morning. How are you feeling? My head hurts here, in the middle. That's nothing. It will go away. So Mr... So... We would like to inform you about your condition. First of all, I wanted to tell you not to worry. A first estimation, based on preliminary examinations, is that you suffer from amnesia. Yes, I understand. Don't worry, you're not alone. Cases have increased dramatically. How could this happen to me? Nowadays, amnesia strikes suddenly, without any warning. Yes... Am I going to stay here long? We don't know yet. Unfortunately there is no cure for your condition, and no patient has regained their memory. We shouldn't disappoint our patients. We already said that. Yes. I am sorry. In the meantime, your relatives may search for you. You might return home. We prescribe an injection of amobarbital, and ongoing memory recovery tests. Chicken. Earring. Bow-tie. -Key. -Bravo! Ball. A ball? What kind of ball? Football. A tiny one. One out of eight. No progress. Let's move on to the next test. Which picture matches the song? Wrong, the next one. Medicine. It hurts a lot there. Don't do it there. This one is more visible. Do it here. Hold it. May I ask you something? Where is the gentleman who was here? His relatives came today and took him home. Don't worry. Your family will find you soon enough. -How are we doing today? -Very well. Good. I wanted to tell you that I am responsible for unclaimed patients. All this time, no one has come for you. It may be a long time before that happens. It's also possible that they've forgotten. If so, you'd have to stay here a long time. -In here? -Yes. It's difficult to be alone, without an identity. You can't even travel. Even if you wanted a job, it's doubtful anyone would hire you. Yes, I know. -You could do something else. -What do you mean? You can make a new beginning. We have a program: "Learning How to Live". You will not regain your memory. We don't have a solution for that. But it would help you begin a new life and create new experiences and memories. We call this program "New Identity". -"New Identity"? -Yes. Otherwise you'd have to stay here a long time. Come by the doctors' office so we can talk about it with everyone. What time? -Why? Do you have anything to do? -No, nothing. I went to a demonstration once with my university roommate. The blond girl standing on my left. Beautiful girl. And I read that there is another demonstration next week. I have been to many demonstrations. Your idea is not bad. We could ask them to make a Molotov cocktail and take it with them. They might need it. It seems a bit extreme to me. I just thought it would be nice for them to be part of a crowd and to protest. OK, I write it down here and maybe I will record it later. You could try doing a wheelie. No one forgets how to ride a bike, so you'll certainly pull it off. And afterwards, don't forget to take a picture. Good luck. -What do you think about the house? -It's very nice. OK. So, this is for your expenses. Let us know if you need more, or if there's anything else you need. Are you sure you understand? Yes. How long do you think it'll take? We'll see. Don't worry. Good... ...night. Goodnight. May I have a try? No, mate. We don't lend them out. It's OK. Don't worry. I'll give it right back. OK! Thanks! -Good morning. -Good morning. New in the neighborhood? Yes. Where do you live? Right up the street. Number 135. Sorry, I live at number 8. Not 135. Here. Try this. It's delicious. Have you ever had such a tasty apple? Never. Let me give you some. A lot of people will be there, for sure. Try to make friends and have fun together. You must start getting closer to people. And approach a woman if you like. Many beautiful girls will be there. A little flirting isn't a bad thing. Guys, anybody know Batman? You sure you don't have an ID on you, pal? Let's go. And have fun in general. You will sit there. You'll have a drink, then you'll find a girl to dance for you. Get close to her. Don't be shy. You will have a chance to get close to a woman's body. Let her do whatever she wants to you, and you can grab whatever you want. Have fun in general. Excuse me. Excuse me, are any of your colleagues available to dance? Excuse me, can you stay still? Here we are. We put him here? Yes. Do you think he ran away? He's probably out. I'll open with the keys. He can cook. It's very good. Yes. And he is very punctual with the photographs. He has done everything exactly as we asked. Look. He caught a perch after all, just as we told him to. Good. -I'll check the rest of the house. -Okay, I'll follow. Can I have a little of this yellow sauce? Thank you. Malou? What are you doing here? Malou! Malou, come here! RE-RELEASE 3 SCREENINGS, SATURDAY ONLY It's better to use flash at night. Or it will come out dark. Can you take a picture for me? Yes. Where do you want it? Here, next to the poster. Thanks. What did you think of the movie? It was very scary. Yes, it was. Good night. Which way are you going? That way. Me too. There's something I didn't get. When they came to that strange house with the bones and skulls, why did they go in instead of running away? It was obvious something bad would happen. But it was a horror film. Yes, I don't know... If I were in her position, I would have surely escaped. Its a shame they never showed us films in the hospital. Didn't anyone look for you while you were in the hospital? No. My relatives never came. The doctors told me that I probably didn't have any, or that I didn't get along with them... Or maybe they've forgotten. Yes, it's possible. A lot of people have forgotten. Let me ask you something. Tomorrow I have to do something very difficult and I need some help. Could you come along? Yes. Eh... Maybe. Nice! What do you have to do? I will explain tomorrow. Thanks! Outside the city for sure. Without many people around. And don't be too afraid. You have done more than me. Do you have the key? Yes, it's here. -Let's go? -Let's go! I think this is it. I don't think it's the right one. But they said it's black. But why won't it open? Because it's not the right one. Is this it? Probably. Are you sure you know how to drive? I think so. Ready? What happened? Nothing. A very beautiful girl, a redhead. And her mother wanted to marry her off to some rich guy, but she fell in love with someone else. A poor man. He had won the ticket in a card game. And they all traveled together on a big ship. An old ship. Yes, and then? Then the ship sank and they all drowned... Except for her. And how did it sink? It crashed onto an iceberg. What a tragic story. Yes. I cried my eyes out the other day. Have you seen this movie? I don't think so. -Is it okay here? -No. How about here? No. Maybe here? No. That's great! You remember it all by heart. Eh... here we are! Are you OK? I told you, I can do it for a long time. Yes. And what do you think it means? Maybe I was an athlete. Track and field? What's that? Nothing, forget it. Doesn't the scarf bother you? Will you stay like this for long? I told you I can stay for four minutes. I'm counting in my head. 151, 152, 153, 154... I did it. 154. I stayed up for four minutes. 154 makes four minutes? Yes. Why are you laughing? No, it's nothing. Because you did it. I'm going to go. Your purse. Yes, thank you. See you tomorrow. Where? We will talk. The truth is, we have all experienced jumping from somewhere high. It's a powerful experience. Just climb up and do it. Don't be afraid. It's not dangerous. 10 meters is nothing. Oh, and don't forget to wear goggles. Chlorine is not good for the eyes. Remember to take a picture afterwards. You think you can fix it? I think I know what's wrong with it. You keep the house clean. I find cleaning boring. I think I fixed it. -Stand there so I can take a picture. -Okay. What happened? I think there's no film left. It's okay, I'll put a new one in later. Wait, I'll try once more. It doesn't matter. I'm late anyway, I have to go. Won't you stay a little longer? I cooked. I'll come another time, I can't right now. Where are you going? Can I come with you? Yes, why not? I'm coming, wait a minute. It's tough today. Should we get a last drink and then leave? I can't leave yet. Why is that? It's nothing. There are only couples left. What did you say? Nothing. Okay, let's have another drink. You were dancing really well before. Thanks. I'm going to the toilet. Follow me. To the toilet? -Good afternoon. -Hello. Anything else? I have some really good oranges. No, no. I prefer the apples. Stomach problems, eh? When I get the runs, I eat five or six apples and I'm right as rain. They also say they're good for the memory. But people don't buy them. You should go to a bar. Or a club. Once you're there, drink a lot and dance all night long. And find a girl who's a really good dancer. Or a boy. Whomever you like. You should flirt with her. Hug her and ask her to follow you to the toilets, and have sex. It should be a one-night adventure. A one-night stand. You don't have to fancy her very much. Just use her and take a photo. That's it. You're doing well for now. Even though you don't have any pictures from the bar and the sex. Haven't you done that? Eh.. yes, I have. But I was drunk and I didn't take a picture. Alright then. Excuse me, may I ask you something? How long will this go on for? We don't know that. When you're ready, we will let you know. Take a look. Very nice. How about the one with the parachute? Not yet. It's for a bit later. A parachute? What parachute? What do I have to do? Nothing. We'll tell you afterwards. You've done the easy ones so far. Now things will become more complicated. We'll explain it all on the recordings. Don't worry. Cheers. And then, I want you to stay with his relatives. I'd like you to go to a hospital. Find someone who's very ill, who's at the end of his days. And I want you to spend some time with him. Visit him every day. Stand by him and give him courage. Do this every day for a few hours. If he asks for help, help him. And when the time comes for him... to go, I want you to go to his funeral and say goodbye. And then, I want you to stay with his relatives. Excuse me. My mistake. I'm sorry. This is the fifth time. What do the doctors say? That things are tough. They only give him a few more days. To tell you the truth, I hope he goes quietly in his sleep. I don't want him to suffer anymore. I'm sorry. Can you give me some water? I should be getting back to my aunt. She's all alone. I'll come by and check on you again. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. The soup's really good today. But... I'm craving something sweet. Would it be good for you? What difference does it make? What would you like to have? A homemade pastry. Like the ones my wife used to make. Is your wife alive? She is. She has forgotten. And she's constantly at home. That's why it's only my daughter who comes to visit. Maybe it's better this way. It will be easier for her. She will not have to forget about you. You? Don't you have a girl? Aren't you married? Eh... I was. She passed away. So I will bring you a pastry. Who is it? It's me. -Are you there? -Yes. Want to come up? Not now, I'm in a hurry. I was looking for you these last days. We haven't talked since that night at the bar. Can you hear me? Yes... Look. I'm busy right now. I came to ask you for help with something. Again? At noon I've to go to a funeral of an old lady and it sounds so boring. You want to come with me? I can't! OK... I'm leaving now... Bye. Bye. So, today you have to do something very different. Where you go doesn't matter. We'd prefer it to be somewhere with lots of people. And there, you have to find someone who is treating someone badly. And then, you'll... -Hello. -Hello. How are you? Good, how about you? APPLES In loving memory of Konstantinos Nikou
