Because I would be able to finally solve this case. How much?! - There were so many moments... - I'm warning you... - ...where I needed you. - They will protect us. - We are living in a constitutional state. A Tokyo Broadcasting System Kadokawa Shoten and King Records Production I have checked the fingerprints. But none of the traces lead anywhere. Wait a second, I was supposed to say that. Relax, that's Madarame's revenge. I am so happy that I got to know you. Yes, I know it sounds like a flowery phrase but now that I am never going to see your smiling face again... those words to me are getting a completely new meaning. Dear God, give me one more smile of his, only one more, for the last time. Shibata? Mayama San! Don't fall asleep there! You are heavy! Get up. Oh no! What a bummer! Good morning! Shibata, what are you doing here? Hmm? "I am so happy" What is this? "but now" "that I am never going to see your smiling face again..." "those words to me" Does it mean that...? Hmm? It doesn't mean anything. Shibata has fallen in love?! Please don't shoot yet! Please don't shoot yet! Please don't shoot yet! Shoot! KEIZOKU - The Movie Police Headquarter 11 days left to my retirement. Head of subdivision - Nonomura 10 days left to your retirement? Yes. When I was a young police officer I was a real daredevil. Couldn't keep myself out of danger's way. Who would've thought that I would live to see my retirement? Later as head of the subdivision I had to bear a lot of responsibility. I have heard that you want to marry again? DIVORCE! WEDDING DAY! My wife is getting divorced. I'll give her 30 million... of my retirement pension for agreeing on the divorce. Then I can cling to my young love and walk her down the aisle! The retirement pension for a head of the subdivision amounts to 30 million 22,640. 22,640 are all I'll need for the rest of my life. And the smile of my little Miyabi! What an idiot... Hello! Yes? The superintendent has an announcement to make. And here he is: our very own superintendent. Hello my dears. A lot of things are going to change around here. From this day on the head of this wonderful subdivision will get the status of head of the sub-subdivision And what does that mean? It means that in the course of this afternoon we will learn who is going to take over the position of head. Nonomura will be relegated?! But I didn't do anything, did I? And that is why you will be relegated. Of course your retirement pension will also be cut down. The retirement pension of the head of a sub-subdivision only amounts to 28.7 million and some. Which means that you'll be short by... 1.3 million for your divorce agreement. I'm sorry! I've been delayed! Welcome to office, new head of the subdivision! I thank you very much for putting so much trust in me. Shibata Jun reporting for duty! And I'll try my best to win over your hearts. Shot by shot! Obviously your heart is filled with sorrow? Dear Father, even though I do possess a lot of experience in life I will remain a stray lamb. In this world all of us will forever be stray lambs. Depending on love, devotion, care and love... I'm sorry sweetie, all hell broke loose! I really wanted to be here on time! That rush-hour traffic... Are you angry at me? Are you not going to marry me anymore? Of course I want to marry you! As soon as possible! But as things stand now I cannot get divorced from my wife. Why not? Is it because you still love her?! As if! It will only take a little longer. You have to be patient. I understand. I'm only a burden for you. No, my little angel. Rather I'm a burden for you, right? No, you are wonderful! I love you! And does my sweetheart love me, too? Yes! Yes! Of course! Wow! I'm so happy with you. In the name of heaven! May this bond be blessed! Here's a visitor. Isoyama San would like to talk to you. She's a survivor of Jinryumaru No. 7 which was a luxury liner that sank 15 years ago. A terrible disaster which costed many lives! Well then, come in! Repent! Repent for what? Repent for your sinful thoughts. I assume you are responsible for this division? Yes! I am the head! - What do you want? - Well, this is my mother. She survived the terrible disaster when the Jinryumaru Number 7 sank to the ground of the ocean. It happened before sunrise... on the 24th of March in 1985. The ship was on its way to the island of Yakujin. 2 of the 9 passengers drowned harrowingly. It's still unclear what happened back then. - Yakujin, also known as the Bermuda Triangle of Japan! - What nonsense! - There are reports which show... - Shut up! Yakujin is the most southern of the Ogasawara islands. Measuring only 40km in size it is relatively small. People claim that the island disappears from time to time. And there during the last 75 years 33 ships, 7 widebodies and diverse helicopters got lost. Without any reasonable explanation. The inhabitants of that island... disappeared 30 years ago as if by a ghost's hand. And shortly afterwards the island submerged for the first time. I saw it. A seven-headed dragon, which drove in the spray, the incarnation of the devil, had devoured the island. That's good. What did she say? I don't know, sounds like French to me. But that was French. Why are you here? Quite recently we got this letter here. Dear Sir or Madam, I hope this letter finds you in best health. Time goes by so fast. 15 years have passed since that tragic accident. Now I'm 22 years old and don't want to look back to that day. Instead I'd rather think of the future optimistically. This I vowed to myself. That's why I would like to invite the friends of my father, and all of those who helped investigate the cause of the accident, to a modest party for which I've already made the arrangements. Sincerely yours, Kirishima Nanami. Kirishima Jiro, the man who went to great strengths in order to open up the Yakujin islands for tourism. He and his wife died then at the catastrophe. So Nanami is his daughter! Yes, this is invitation came from the daughter of the only 2 victims of this terrible disaster. And what does all of this have to do with us? Mom has been behaving very curiously since that incident. And that's why I'm worried. I keep telling her that she'd better not go to that party, but unfortunately she doesn't want to listen to me. It's maybe asked too much but could some of you accompany us to the island? Sure! We'd love to! Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Sure, but we didn't get an invitation to that party. Oh well, oh well! That's too bad! Oh, here! I simply didn't get to open that letter yet! We nearly fell for that trick! So now all that's left to do is to chose who will have the honor of going to that island. You will have to give that command to either one of us. Well, well, Mayama San, we're at the police here Team spirit is one of our priorities! Anyone who wants to participate should raise his hand. Ready, steady, go! Who would like to go?! I do!!! Oh, that's what I would call a big run! So we will have to draw straws or something like that. You asked for it! Here we go. Mayama San, you first. I WON! These lucky sashes will protect you. Oh, thanks, that's very kind of you. Yet totally unnecessary. Bansai! It is said that those doomed to perdition won't appear on photos. Oops? There is really someone missing. Oh! Hi Isoyama Akiko San! - Hi Isoyama Akiko San! - Call me Shoko. Pardon? Where did the French jabbering mother go? - She had a dizzy spell. - Huh? It's nothing perilous. She wants me to represent her on the party. Suspicious. Madame! - The green bag! - Of course! Welcome aboard. - Take care, boss! - Of course. Now who is that? That's the essayist Hasegawa. You can see her on every talk show. Also suspicious. There you go. - Kurihara San! - Takiyama. You're cruising while your company is going to hell? You must talk! To my understanding you are still the horror of every stockholders' meeting. Still the same old loudmouth, hmm? The decent looking guy is Takiyama, a lawyer who had twice been accused of blackmail. And the loudmouth is Kurihara, a real estate agent, with good connections to politicians. After the stock market crash he was left with a huge river of red ink. All three belong to the survivors of the disaster. Well, that's to good to be true. Have a nice trip! Morons! Very funny! Stop laughing! Better go back to work! - That terrible rocking! - Well, this is a ship, dearest. Kurihara! Good day, and welcome aboard. You are Nihara, you were a member of the crew of the sunken ship. You have read up on that very well? Please let me know if you have any further wishes. I'm the captain and I'll bring you whatever you want. - I want more of that Dom PÃ©rignon! - Of course, in an instant. Yeah, right, in an instant! As if! - Who is that? - That's Naito Akio. An architect who has designed many important buildings. Unfortunately he got addicted to alcohol some years ago. And that has hindered his work so much that he had to retire. I have to return to the bridge and wish you a pleasant journey. - So Naito is present again as well. - Yes - But I haven't spotted Kita anywhere yet? - He is on board as well. And I could talk him into giving me a massage. Afterwards he fell asleep. Well, I could use a little massage myself. I put a sign on his door. It reads "Massages". So now even you can find him. I hate it, my butt is hurting. Kita Kazuhiro, he used to work for Kirishima. But now he's posing as a sex slave in an infamous sado-maso club. A sex slave...!? - Are you Kita San? - Could you give me a massage? No. - How are you today? - How are you? - How are you? I beg you, can't you mark down the price by 1.36 million? No. You earn 140 million every year! I'll already give you all of my retirement pension! Don't be so greedy and renounce 1,36 million my darling. It's already very generous that I am going to get divorced from you, isn't it? No, you are going to pay that money. Better come up with something good! Go get it from a loan-shark! Or work on a tuna cutter!? You could as well sell a kidney!? You are so healthy... No, that's not a good idea... I have sworn to love you "Till death do us part". And your floozy has just gotten rid of her swaddling clothes. So quit whining, be a man and get the money. Your entrance, Madame! It's about time! "Attention, attention! All parties concerned! The simulcast will start in 4 minutes." This is much too tight! I am not going to renounce anything. I want it all. "We ask all participants to move to area C." Fast, Madame, we're in a hurry, this way. Mayama San?! What is it? What's with you? - I'm getting sick. I'm seasick! - Oh, you'll be better soon. Hey, not on me! Eww, that's so gross! We will have reached our destination in about 30 minutes. Have a nice day! It's unbelievable, isn't it? This island disappears from time to time. What do you think of this? Be careful at the exit. Welcome to the island of Yakujin. Look, starfish! Where? There! I don't see any! Where are they? Show me! Below the boat! You have to lean over! I'll hold you. Shibata?! I am the head of the subdivision! Wait up! There it is! A haunted castle! Of course... I feel somewhat inconsolable. I didn't expect you yet. Well, excuse me, you invited us for today! Perhaps then I should introduce myself first: I am Kirishima Nanami. And it's right, I invited all of you. And I'm glad that you have come to visit me here on this island. I will pay you back for that. I've lovingly prepared a reception menu for you. If you would be so kind to follow me... That's the best I've eaten in a long time. - What is it? - It's seasnake. That's disgusting! So what! Let's do some Karaoke! Then this party here will really get started! I totally agree! I feel like I'm attending my own funeral. Okay, then we are all going to amuse ourselves to death. - We're going to play cards? - Yes. What's this game called? "Reading the cards". - Oh, gotta be one of those cheap tricks! - Give them to me! What next? First you shuffle them and hand everyone one card. But I must not see who gets which card. Shibata San and Mayama San will not partake in this game. Hey, tell me, who actually are you? I don't even know you. - My name's Shibata. - Doesn't matter. Tell me what you are?! Police officer! Oh no, not that! Don't worry, Takiyama, she and the young man will protect us. This is indeed a very mysterious island. Things disappear constantly. Even though I was alone on this island last week all kinds of things from the castle disappeared. Yesterday I had to bid farewell to my favorite bird. And today one of those present will kiss his existence goodbye. It's the person who got the most valuable card. So what, then I'm out of the woods, right? - Joker! - You're safe. - I got an ace of spades. - Hearts 3. - Spades 7. - I got the spades 8. And I got a queen in clubs. And I got a king. Spades that is. Then you're not going to stay among the living for much longer. Farewell. Such nonsense! Enough of that, I'd rather go to sleep. Why?!! Kurihara San!? Is he dead? Yes, he's dead. He's dead. He is dead! The food was poisoned. Was all of it poisoned? Nothing will happen to you. There was definitely no poison in your food. But he has been poisoned! A mystery, a mystery! He must have been killed by the God of the island. No! I rather believe that someone is playing with forged cards. This pack of cards has been marked. It may not be obvious, but all of the cards have little marks which tell their value. The funny Joker, the spadey ace, the lonesome hearts three, the lucky seven,... perchance today is the 8th, the queen is female and the king is almighty. I assigned a deeper meaning to every card. It wasn't the cards the victims had picked themselves. You knew who had which card before you came up with your story! A simple yet very persuasive card trick. Well then, I may know a card trick or two. But when do you think I was able to poison the unlucky Kurihara? This I'll have to find out. Yes. Otherwise you won't have anything to hold against me. We're living in a constitutional state, a paradise for criminals. What is that supposed to mean? It means you can consider yourself lucky that you haven't been called to account for the last 15 years. Because you're responsible for the deaths of my parents. You could have saved them back then. But you didn't let them enter the life boat. Well, the way you put it it sounds so terrible. We didn't have any choice! In that life boat there was only room for 7 people. Would we have let those two entered, all of us would have drowned miserably with them. Like I said, you killed them. For those kinds of emergency there are certain exceptions. Sure, you are expected to do first aid, yet if that means putting yourself in danger, you don't have to do it. Which means it is not a crime if you only watch someone die, because you don't want to put yourself in any danger. And who is to decide who will live and who won't? Your parents had opted for death. They sacrificed their lives for us. Just tell me the truth. What really happened back then? Obviously you feel ashamed!? And I think I know why that is. That's why I will have to kill all of you, one by one. This is all going too far for me! Really, you two are police officers! What are you waiting for? Arrest this woman! That's impossible, for a detention we need solid evidence. It seems they are not in the position of putting an end to my killing spree. And, even better: Shibata and Mayama San... will be chief witnesses of my defense and prove my innocence. I'm sorry, but this is getting too absurd! Nihara San, prepare the boat. Tonight we will take off. At your command! Wait Shibata! What will happen to the corpse?! My boat! It disappeared! Well spotted. You took it! - Any proof for your accusation? - Who else could have taken it?! Apart from me there are many other suspects at hand. I notice that at least seven other people seem to have a guilty conscience. Better go to your rooms and try to relax. Make yourselves feel at home here. - Oh, that's very good. - Really? Hello? I beg your pardon but could you please give me some soap? Pardon? I wanted to run a bath but I forgot to bring soap. OK. I could give you some shampoo as well? Oh, that won't be necessary. I always wash my hair with soap. My hair looks so terrible! I'm sorry. But in my room there's no mirror. Thank you very much. I'm not going to bother you anymore. Shibata? I need soap! What are you doing there? Well, I fell into the sea! And I'm trying to wash the salt out of my clothes. - But for that you should take your clothes off!? - Well, I did. - No, you didn't! - That's none of your business. What are you doing in my room anyway? - We better hurry! - Yes. - Shibata! We need to go up to the roof! - Sure! Damn. - Well? - There is no corpse. - Why not? - No idea! Hasegawa San?! But she must have come down right here?! Is there something wrong? Nanami San!? Didn't you just kill Hasegawa San and threw her dead body off the roof? Why, no! Then the corpse would be lying here somewhere!? Yes, I don't get that either. Ended up in smoke just like that?! Stop being silly, you're police officers! Another person has been killed here! Arrest this woman! I think it's about time that I get away from here. Just like all of you are going to disappear very soon. That's enough! Naito San! Be careful! Naito San!!! Where is that wicked beast?! There! Up there! She's gone. Just like that. I believe it's too risky going out again in the dark tonight in order to do something. We should rather stay inside and think of an escape plan for tomorrow. The seven-headed dragon! Dad...? Finally I know who's behind all this! It feels so good. I believe you are looking for the dead. If you are looking for the dead, you should go to the island of Yakujin. There you will find the gate to the underworld. - And that's where my father is? - Yes, there he is. That's so heavy! What's in it? Smoke? Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! - What's going on? - Help! Help! There's fire! Water, quick! - No, wait, no, don't panic! - Go get water! Shut up! It's impossible to fall asleep like that! - What a delicious smell! - Mmm, such a delicious smell... Kita San doesn't want to have breakfast with us. He would rather stay in his room. But why? The smell is so delicious... Perhaps we can manage to find a boat here somewhere with which we can get to the neighbouring island. There we will plan what to do next. We will search the jungle. And you will check the beach for boats. Good luck! No, don't run away! ...don't run away... What is it? I've known from the start that we are going to get lost here! It's all your fault! Because I have come across a fat fable rat. And that is? Supposedly a phantom of the underworld. There are people who would pay 3 million for such a rat! 3 million? Seriously? Yes, three million! Enough for Nonomura's divorce. Forget Nonomura! - Found anything which could help us? - No, nothing at all. Who's there? Kita San, you don't have any choice. You should give up. Never. Then I will have to let you and this room disappear forever... - Mayama San? - Hmm? Have you ever heard of an island on which the gate to the underworld can be found? Underworld? The realm of the dead. I see. The realm of the dead!? Should this gate exist would you use it for seeing your sister again? I only know that I want to see my father. My biological father. I had been adopted. By the family to which I owe the name Shibata. I was 4 then so I barely have any memories of my real father. All I can remember is that he was a hero! And he had been murdered. I brought some provisions in case we got lost in the jungle! Finally some good news! Now that's a real feast! Where's the can opener? - Pardon? - The can opener! I'm a numskull! Damn! What's this fuss all about? Who's throwing those cans around? What's going on here? This is police constable Tsubosaka. My darling! My poor darling! - Ms. Tsubosaka, I am awfully sorry. - My darling! What have they done to you!? - They won't take you away from me! - Stop that! Calm yourself down! Please come to your senses! Let go of me! This is my husband! This is evidence. My beloved! Who did this to you?! Asakura!!! You think that Asakura could have something to do with this? I've been working in this job for 40 years. And during that time you develop some kind of instinct. I do have a feeling that this will be our last fight, to the death. We're too early, our ship will leave the harbor in about 1 hour. If this is really going to be a matter of life and death... you should bid farewell now, before it's too late. Miyabi! Why you look so anxious? Miyabi,... I wished I had a choice but I'm a police officer. Oh yes! I know that! Not too long ago, one of my colleagues... I've already made myself some wonderful "Hello Kitty" visiting cards. Because soon I will be bearing your name. And because I do have so many friends I ended up with thousands of cards. Now I can show off with you a thousand times. Be still for a while and listen good, Miyabi. And the very first visiting card I will give to you. It is supposed to give you lots of luck. Of course I am worried about you, but I am the wife of a police officer. You have to carry out your duty. And soon you will come back home safely. It's like that, right? Miyabi! Where's the former head of the subdivision? He should've been here by now. The ship will to take off any moment, right? Well, there's a problem. The ship's cook caught a terrible fever and collapsed. Pull yourself together! Too much soy sauce is deadly for you! Don't get sassy! I don't intend to die! Yakondo San? Be so kind and get me some cigarettes. Marlboro Menthol. Better get a whole carton. - We'll most likely be gone for a long time. - Huh? You heard me. Can you do me that favor? Of course, on my way. I think police officers shouldn't have a wife. I have kept you waiting long enough, Captain. Now you can take off. I think it's this way. Looks like right out of the jungle book! Step gently. Hey, Shibata! Shibata! Shibata!!! I found it! The fat fable rat. I got it! We'll repair the broken boat which we found and get away as fast as we can. Let's hope things will work out then! I'm beat. What time may it be? Hmm? My watch is broken! I paid 3,940 Yen for it and that was when I was a student. I've had it! I want to get away from here! Oh, excuse me, sorry. LAND OF THE UNDERWORLD Why would anyone make a color copy of this kitsch? Color copies cost a fortune. That's the last thing I needed! Where is it? It's open! - Shibata! Have you seen my aspirin? - No. - But I'll die without aspirin! - Why is that? That beast bit me! Stupid fable rat! I hate you! She's a danger to public safety! I will break your neck! Oh, hmm, Mayama San? Have you perhaps seen my panties somewhere? No! Damn! This really hurts! I had taken it off in order to wash it in the tub. And then I had put it here so that it can get dry. But then there was that scream and we ran into the hall and I forgot to put it back on. You are not wearing anything underneath? Get lost! Oh no! I nearly saw something! How terrible! What a mishap! Do you at least have an alka-seltzer for me? Stop poking fun at me. If anyone should see me walking around without panties, I will never find a husband for myself! Mayama San! Give me back my panties, now! You're a mean panties thief! Why would I do that?! You can make a pair of new ones out of your pillow! But never again accuse me of stealing anyone's panties! I am not insane! May I have the police's attention for a while?! Someone has stolen my appointment calendar! Theft doesn't fall under the responsibility of this division. Come again?! Hey! My brief case has been stolen! I want it back right now! - You're lucky. I've been bitten by a rat. - Well, my panties, uhm... Excuse me. Something disappeared right out of my room. The dressing table. That's impossible! We've all been robbed. Everyone is missing something. I am missing my panties, Mayama San his life... - Hey, I am still alive! - That was a joke! Mayama San is missing his aspirin, Naito San his brief case, Takiyama Sans his appointment calendar. Hey? Where's Kita San? So it means that he's the miserable thief! He'll be sorry for that! We're gonna take him to task! His room disappeared! The 7 was crushed, together with Kita San. It really squished him. That's horrible. We have to get to the next island ASAP. I'm going to get my stuff. What's actually missing from your room, Shibata San? It's gone as well! What else has disappeared? The next island! He's right! It's gone. She's really good at it. You have to give Nanami that, right? Oh, really? She's going to kill us all. All of us! Unless we beat her to it. We're going to kill you!!! Nanami! Where are you, Nanami?! Hey, what's this?! Those are the panties which had been taken from me! Now there's hope that I will get married one day, even if my skirt would be swept away! Have your panties changed colors while you washed them? Well, they looked like that before, it's called "red lace"! - My appointment calendar! - And my brief case! And where's my aspirin? My aspirin!? I'm sorry, but they've been lying in my panties! Please stop that, you perv! This is simply not done... There's a strange bag here! It's Kita. She has put herself to death... What...? Number 17. What does this number mean? 17? A room number perhaps?! There's no such room here. No matter what, this woman is dead. The case is solved. Somehow this really soothes me... - We still have to be careful! - And why is that? Even if Nanami has killed all of the others, there's still someone who has to answer for her death. She has killed herself! Anyone can see that! She would never have killed herself before her work was done! Perhaps it was done!? Perhaps she got everyone responsible for the death of her parents. - Exactly! We are innocent... - Yeah, right... An island on which things keep disappearing. People disappear, ships sink, even the neighboring island gets lost in the sea... Oh! Not again! This is nonsense! I may not know much, but this I know for sure... ...Well, forget it. Doesn't matter... No matter what I do for you, your heart won't be mine, you don't love me. I would like to love you, but I simply can't! If you can't belong to me, you won't belong to anyone... That desperate? I was of the opinion that when enough time has passed my mother would come back to her senses and regain enough strength to smile again. I was willing to represent her on this very island. Now I doubt that she'll ever be able to forgive herself. It must be terrible to hate other people with all your heart. But hating yourself must be even worse. Mayama San! Help me! Shibata!!! Shibata!? Shibata?! - Shibata?! - Shibata San!!! I'm sorry, didn't mean to scare you. What are you doing up there? When we saw how Hasegawa San fell down that roof we assumed that she must have landed right below that window. So we looked for her body there, to no avail... - Look through this! - Why? Watch me through this glass! You have to hold it a little farther away. And now comes the surprise! - You see? - What? If seen through a lens a picture will inevitably be flipped. And the round window through which we saw Hasegawa's fall works just like a lens. Hasegawas corpse had been put on a rope which then dangled up and down in the air. And when we saw her falling down in front of the window she had actually been pulled up to the roof by Nanami. So Nanami was the killer, right? Yet I doubt that she could have pulled Hasegawa's corpse up to the roof!? She cheated a little bit by decapitating the body. Nanami first killed Hasegawa and then cut her head off. Which she then put on an inflatable rubber doll. The screams we had heard were those of Nanami. That's how she got rid of the body. So Hasegawa and Kurihara were killed by Nanami alone? Hasegawa most obviously. But as to the poor Kurihara, she couldn't have poisoned him alone. No, she needed an accomplice who could help her kill off Kurihara and this person most likely killed Nanami as well. The murder of Kita was probably committed by him as well. He surely must still be here on this island. And who is that supposed to be? The killer will make himself known to us very soon. That's for sure. - Move, Sumomann! - No, he has to stay inside the circle. - What? - He must be standing inside. Oh, I understand. Stay there! Stay there! Stay there! Don't halloo till you're out of the wood! So you really believe that killer will reveal himself to us? No idea. You said something else before!? May I ask you something? Would you like to have lots of money? Why certainly! How much are we talking here? - Twenty billion! - What?! Well, when I realized that none of this was just about Nanami's revenge I started looking for the motif of the real killer! And where did you look? In a book I got hold of. Here. What is this? The diary of Nanami's father. I was searching about the attic up there where I found this diary, so I took it. Nanami's father was apparently a very successful man. That is why during the Japanese economy boom he had to keep raising credits. And the money from those credits must be hidden somewhere here. I don't quite understand!? 15 years ago Japan's economy was advancing fast. People thought it would go on like this forever, and real estate prices rose to astronomical heights. And if your real estate property assets amounted to 5 billion, the banks downright forced you to lend 10 billion from them! Why is that?? The banks can only profit from the boom by cashing in on the interests. Those pigs! If you are forced to lend money you don't even need one day you'll have more money than you could ever spend. In his diary he wrote that he was sitting on 20 billion, with which he didn't know what to do. In his desperation he came to the conclusion that he should simply bury those billions. - And where did he bury them? - Right about.. Here. Combined with the one Nanami wrote down before she died, this will lead the way to the money. We're probably going to be very rich soon! Well, who do we have here? Yet another choirboy! CHOIRBOY No. 1 CHOIRBOY No. 2 And you're the 3rd! We put on this show for all of you. Flabbergasted, huh?! ...this will lead the way to the money. ...this will lead the way to the money. ...to the money. You're all blinded by mammonism! Could be... Come on! Hold your horses! You know... I could kill you and the other two right on the spot and throw your bodies into the sea. Wait, wait! Let's alternate! I'm warning you! I'll tell to the press and TV what kind of police officer you are! Go on! Do it! Tell it to anyone you want! Because as it seems right now we're the only ones left on this island, aren't we? And I really plan on killing all three of you right now and dumping you into the sea. Then there'll be no witnesses! You, are you completely out of your mind?! If you want to lighten your consciences before you're going to die you may confess to me. Good morning! Shibata San! Hi! I saw another one of those fat fable rats! I followed it into the cave where I got completely lost! I was afraid that I wouldn't make it out of there alive! It must have been terrible for you! Yes. The whole journey to this island has been rather thrilling for me! But now I'm not needed here anymore. Why not?! Because I've finally solved this case. It was rather confusing, with all the stuff disappearing here on this island. Yes, that's for sure. Yet it was all part of a sophisticated plan. Someone laid out a trap for me and I totally fell for it. You have been fooled? Yes. But then something got too heavy for them. And so they were forced to let other things disappear as well. I don't know what you're talking about? Shoko San, your dressing table posed a bit of a problem for them. But the dressing table did disappear?! Exactly, because they were not able to move it again. So it had to go. Shibata San, I don't think I can follow you anymore. I doubt that. Because I believe that the person, who had planned all of this so cleverly Shoko San, was YOU. Strictly speaking, there is no Shoko San. You're the fraternal twin of Nanami. Kirishima Miku San. I've found your father's diary and I've read it. In it there's a pretty detailed description of you. That Nanami's twin sister could be here as well at first seemed quite improbable to me. But on the other hand are two identical hotels, placed opposite of each other on a small island like this very unlikely as well. There are two hotels?! I don't want to insult your father, but his writing was rather dire. At first I even thought it would be some kind of cipher! Voila! What is written here at first seemed to be the number 13. But then I figured that it is actually the letter B. Anyone, who doesn't know of hotel B, would take this for a 13. But you knew of the 2nd hotel! That's why you recognized the B immediately. Wait a second. Please, ok? This picture here, after realizing that it was only a copy, made me wonder... "Why would anyone make a color copy of this kitsch?" The answer of course was plain and simple! For two identical hotels you also need to have two completely identical pictures! Nihira San has just recently told us that the real Isoyama Sanae San had died some years ago. This came in handy for you I assume. Because now you could dress up this french babbling woman as Isoyama Sanae San and claim that you are her daughter. - Hey, you there! - During the crossing you took the chance to administer the poison which would kill Kurihara later on. And when we set out to explore the area... We should better search separately. Yes, that way we can achieve more. Kita San, we have found a boat! Really?! A boat! Why?! Help! To make the rooms look identical in both hotels you spared no effort. Together with your sister you kept moving our luggage back and forth through a subterranean channel. While in the cellar a whiff lead me to that connecting channel which aided you in making the rooms perfectly identical. In order to let Kita San's room disappear you swapped the room number signs and spread some blood around. I believe that Nanami San's feeling of guilt grew too strong on her. We're nearly done, we only need to prepare one more room. I don't want to do this anymore. When I killed Hasegawa San my hands were trembling... You traitor... What?! You miserable traitor!!! This deed was perhaps a little blindfolded. Without your sister you couldn't carry the dressing table from A to B. Now you needed an explanation why the dressing table at least seemingly had disappeared from your room. That's why you stole my panties... Mayama San's aspirin, Takiyama Sans appointment calendar, not to forget old Naito San's brief case. And in the end even the neighboring island disappeared. A brilliant idea if I may say so myself. That's very good. Oh, I'm sorry. Shouldn't let myself go like that. Excuse me, but what you are implying... the thing with the identical hotel rooms for example... anyone could have done that. At least anyone who was on this island. So I'm only one of many suspects! Yes! Allow me to show you something. This is my Tokyo University wristwatch! The only brand product I've ever afforded. I see, so? Unfortunately this watch hasn't worked correctly on this island! Then I remembered what was written in its manual: The watch has to be kept away from TV's and other magnetic fields, otherwise it may not function properly. As far as I know this is a volcanic island here. And volcanic activities tend to create strong magnetic fields. A real problem for watches, navigational instruments, and for migratory birds which will go astray when flying over this island. And why are you telling me this? What does any of this have to do with me? A lot. You had used a compass in the forest. But how was that compass supposed to lead you the way when it was surrounded by those strong magnetic fields? No, you didn't need a compass to lead us out of this jungle. You knew the exact way. The way for getting from one hotel to the other. Which means you knew of the two hotels! And that makes you a prime suspect, Shoko. My compass had been broken?! I didn't even notice that! So we were really lucky we got out of that jungle at all. Nice try... Well then, come on, arrest me! You may have solved the case, but as it stands you cannot prove anything! Yes, I can. The determining clue you have just delivered yourself. A moment ago when I broke in on you on the patio you were standing in front of that lion. And I also know why. You were with us when we discovered Nanami's body in the cellar. Number 17. What's the meaning of this number? Number 17, as if! You really wanted us to believe that we were dealing with a number here! You underlined this clue so that it looked like a number. But what was written in the sand there didn't actually mean the number 17, ...but LION, the animal! And what is meant by that is the statue over there. Ironically it was the legacy of your dear parents which lured you here, that's how you convicted yourself. Your parents got something engraved here in french which was obviously meant for you. It reads... "We bequeath this hotel to our beloved daughter Miku, which we had put up for adoption." So those two had built two identical hotels on this island, to prove that they had the same amount of love for their twin daughters! And you can feel this love here, right? Nanami was... Nanami was simply a beauty! As a child she was loved by all. Well, you're a real cutey! What's your name, peewee? Nanami. You're really cute. - And who is that ugly duckling? - That is her sister, Miku. Exactly, she is my sister and not an ugly duckling at all! We're no twins! Of course you are! That's why you two look so equal! We were not equal. There is no equality in this world. Nanami was very unique. Something which I would never be. Go away, go away, go away! What are you doing there? You're hustling her into the traffic?! - What happened? - She tried to kill her sister! - Is that really true?! - What is wrong with you?! Soon afterwards... they had put me up for adoption. In order to protect Nanami. Our parents had only loved her, not me! That's not true, then none of this here would make any sense! Why otherwise are there two hotels... They had only done this for Nanami! I bet they were only scared that I could do something bad to the great Nanami would I feel treated uneven! I was only... only longing for the love of my parents! But now I believe that there is more... You really want to...? I feel so sorry, Miku. Because I know you have suffered because of me. And I love you so much... I've never meant to hurt you... Sayonara... Sister!? She only... only chose death for me... And I, I only hated her and killed her... the only person who had ever loved me! I had been loved without even knowing it. If only I could see her one more time. I want to apologize to her! Sister?! Sister?! How can this be? She is dead?! Come on, let's go, Miku. Father! Mother! Nanami San!? Shoko San!? What's going on here, Shibata? Father?! Wait! Shibata!! Where the hell are you?! What's this? What's all this fog? Mayama! Tsubosaka?! Now hey, what kind of greeting is this? What, when and why? When did you come here? Come on, do tell! I have just arrived here. And why? You're treating me like a stranger. Do you become a stranger, just because you're dead? You are dead?! So then she probably has become a stranger to you, too, right? Shibata? Shibata! Shibata! Father? Daughter? Are you really my father? You have grown so much. I've always been at your side all of those years. Didn't you notice that? No, you should simply have addressed me sometimes. There were so many moments... where I needed you. My brother. We had always been very happy, right? You're not going to leave me again, right? Shibata! Maiko?! Come on over to my world. Hasakura San?! Why do you hate me so much? Why?! Is it just because I've killed? It is my mission to make life immortal through death. And eternal life knows no hatred. Love is all around here! Here even I am being loved. Could you manage to respect me? Shibata! Aya! Who did this to you?! Madarame. Aya belongs to me. And that's why I pulled her over to this world by force. What kind of sadness is it which forces us to love each other?! Let go of your hatred Aya. Become one with the others here. I would rather die than to be with scum like you! Just like the poor Asakura did! I don't need your immortality! I will be immortal anyway. I will go on living in the heart of the only man, who ever truly loved me! As you wish. Then you'll have to die now... So what? The heck with it! Your impotent bullets are never going to enter my soul! Mayama San! When you're going to die... I also will have left this being behind. Don't abandon me! Well, I think I'm not that bad in my first love scene. Aya! You morons! You could live forever if you would swear off hatred. Who the hell are you? I'm still alive as you can see! Then try to shoot me! That's the good thing about being immortal. I will be able to live on in each of you. I can crawl into any body which can help me on. And to this art I owe my immortality. You want to kill me? Then you'll have to kill everyone here! Come on, try it! This damn Madarame in Asakura's body is getting on my nerves! Now I'll be stuck in this unsavory soul of Mayama forever. Idiot! Hatred doesn't necessarily have to be something evil. Would you be hated if you loved someone and took this someone away from another person? And if we would feel neither love nor hate what would we be but lifeless puppets! You don't say! Shoot, Mayama. Shoot! You adorable scumbag... get lost and don't ever come back. Shut up and shoot! Don't do it... Farewell, brother. Sayonara! Kill me and this dream will be over. Over? Daughter. Now we're going to bid farewell. Bid farewell? Why do human beings feel hatred? - Why is that so? - Why can't we all be friends?! - Why not?? - Why not?? - Why aren't we friends? - I've been your friend all along. I can do without friends like you. And that's why I'm going to pull the trigger. Can I come along, too? No way! You'll have to remember us so that we can live on. That's how it works. Try to think of us all the time. And apart from the two of us, you should think about your future. Soon someone will show up who will be yours... and with whom you can have your own family. Please don't go... When you wake this dream will be swept away. Come back, father! Mother? Where are you? Oh no, please come back! Where did you go? Mayama San... Shibata! Shibata!!!! Shibata, forgive me, but you should move on. No, I will stand by you. Head of the subdivision, I beg you, please lay all of the responsibility on me. Mayama! Asakura! I would advice you to back out of this. I've had enough of you. I am sick of you, too! Get lost. What is that supposed to be? A bomb? You can't do this! I made it! Mayama San?! Mayama San?! Mayama San?! Mayama San.... I will live on... and keep you in my soul... and thereby make you immortal. Oh! Two minutes and ten seconds. My personal record. Are you well rested? Don't tell me that you're crying? Trust me, I would never cry. It's only that I've just woken up. It was about time. I think that you have slept long enough. And after wake you should always take a bath. A bath? Let's go! It's great! Isn't it? Yes, I love the water. Bad thing is though that I cannot swim at all. Shibata? What? Have you been swallowed by a shark? May I hang on to you? For ever and ever?
