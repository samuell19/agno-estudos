NETFLIX PRESENTS [heart beating] [orchestral music playing] [sweeping instrumental music playing] -[gulping] -[dish taps on table] [chair squeaks] I remember I used to look at you and say, "Hey!" "One day, I wanna be like that guy." You'd show up in those cars with all those babes, with weapons, giving away money. That was really cool. [clicks tongue] You had a red convertible. A Mazda Miata. I liked that car. What did you do with it? [sighs] I had to pay a debt. It's gone. I remember this one time you came to town, and the car was filthy. I said, "Want me to wash it, boss?" You said yes. Do you remember? [exhales heavily] Man, there were so many kids on that block… [young man] You rubbed my head. You gave me the keys. The guys you were with were laughing their asses off 'cause I didn't know how to start the car. It was on Little Candles Day. The day that disloyal stutterer was killed. There were so many fireworks, everyone was shocked when that snitch was killed. I gave it back nice and clean. You gave me five grand. That was the first money I made. I spent it on fireworks with my buds. Look at us now, Pecoso. [sighs] [fan whirring loudly] You know what? [high-pitched ringing] The problem is between you and Don Óscar. Let me talk to him, and we'll solve this right away. -No, old man. -[mellow rock music plays] [young man] How things change. But we are crooks. And crooks solve matters this way. Hey, wait, wait, wait. Duber, the day that snitch, the stutterer, was killed, wasn't it Halloween? No, it was on Little Candles Day. What do you mean, Little Candles Day? Pecoso, was it on Halloween? Tell us, man. No… it was on Little Candles Day. See? Plus, fireworks aren't sold on Halloween.

I want to get all the curtains in the house replaced. The ones we have are ugly. Plus, they're outdated. And I also want to have the furniture upholstered. We can't do that now. I'm not asking for furniture. Once I get out of this mess, we'll see, OK? Is this because of what happened with Duberney? I told you not to get involved with that kid, but you never listen. No wonder I never liked that guy. Look at what they say about him in town. -The other day, he was seen-- -[shushes] -Have you seen those two before? -Who? Those two. Hmm? No clue. How long have they been there? I don't know. Maybe since they started building that house. Another thing, what will we do about my car? I have to take it in for an inspection this week, and I don't think it'll pass. There's a noise coming from the front end. I don't know what it is. The other day, it left me stranded at the gym. I had to get the trainer to push it. [man on radio] Yesterday, we went to Atanasio Girardot Stadium to the first match of the Colombian soccer league final. Man, it's itchy… but the doctor said I shouldn't fucking scratch there. Oof. That happens when you strain a lot when you shit, right? Possibly. It can be caused by an unhealthy diet, genes, or sitting on hot spots, man. Like when someone stands up on the bus, and you sit where they were. Man, you've had that problem since I met you, buddy. -[man winces] -I try to shit gently. [on radio] Medellín can't be a champion just in Colombian movies. [worker] It's serious. [Yoiner whistles] [Rita mouths silently] [chopping] [lighter clicks] What's new? I am fed up. My grandpa's on my ass more than ever. I haven't been able to get my bike. Mayerly's pissed. How about you? I'm here, doing housework. [dance music plays on headphones] [giggling] It's true. -What's up? -Boss. [Milton] Sir. -Is El Pecoso here yet? -No, he isn't. [Don Óscar] Did you guys call him? I did, but I ran out of minutes. [Don Óscar] These jackasses. See? Two hundred eight thousand for the minimum dose isn't much, no? [phone vibrating] [line ringing] -The drug too? -Sure. A bit of money. [second phone ringing] [line ringing] Ah! Have you seen those two up there? -Where, sir? -Come on, be discreet. No, sir. So, we don't know how long they've been there? No, not really. [dogs barking] Hey, Bobolitro. Shut up, dog! Stop messing around with the damn dogs. Get out of there. -[gate opening] -[dogs panting and growling] Have you seen those two before? Stop reading that damn Bible. Take care of the house. Don't let those two fuckers out of your sight, OK? -Can you do that? -OK, sir. [man on radio] …the structure! This team repositions itself very well when it has the ball. [on radio] …and through block pressure. [engine starts] [music plays on radio] …with good results for the defense, not to mention the diamond… Put that away. We're being too conspicuous. No way. You know what? Let's follow them, man. No. The order is to stay here, watch the house. No. Don't think like a slave. I'm going. You coming or staying here? [on radio] No! He also goes too far. [inhales] Is it very serious or what? Not serious. It could be orchitis, which is an inflammation of the testicle, an obstruction of the vas deferens, or a bilateral varicocele. Since I'm not sure, we'll need to do more tests. Oh. Listen, what I mean is that your sperm are weak. Small. Slow and in short supply, very short supply. With that amount, it's virtually impossible for you to get your wife pregnant. What's wrong with that jerk? He said my sperm aren't worth shit. -[Claudia over phone] He said that, honey? -Imagine! No, then let's see another doctor. Of course we'll see another one because this moron also said my semen is watery. Do you think it's watery? No. [Don Óscar] Yeah, he said he'd do surgery. Well, then it can be fixed. We'll see. Yes, it's OK. We'll see what we can do. OK, I'm heading home, babe. OK, honey. DOCTOR FABRA'S CLINIC Say hi, man, or I'll knock you up. [Fredy laughs] [breathes heavily] -Everything OK, boss? -Strong as an ox, man. Now, the bad news. We're being followed. No way. Duberney? No, the guys from the house next door. What did I tell you? You guys are morons. And fucking Bobolitro couldn't even warn me. Start the car like nothing's wrong. [engine starts] [radio playing] [cell phone ringing] [Milton] Hello? Milton, what are you doing? -I'm heading to Pecoso's place. -Come here. We're being followed. [Milton] Shit. The dudes from the house next door? -Where are you? -We're heading to… Pasoancho. [Don Óscar] Pasoancho in Alvernia. [Milton] I'll be there. [man on radio] …it's the work of the triangle midfield… They're on a big secret mission. What big mission? We should've stayed watching the house. The other one. [man on radio continues indistinctly] These guys are turning again? Man, they're taking us around in circles. Hmm? Turn around, turn around! -They're onto us. -[scoffs] Those pussies chickened out. Shit! [turns off engine] -What will we say? -[sighs] I'll do the talking. You might screw up, man. Mmm? -Hello. -Hello. [men chatting indistinctly] Hey, man, let me do it. Peralta, help this dude. Why are you here? Where is Gamboa? Lieutenant, photos of the operation. Tell me that, with this, you can take down everyone and their mother. Go back. Hey. Even if they shoot at you, you can't move from there. You have to watch the house. Even if you have to take a shit, do it while watching the house. If a hot chick walks by, you can't check out her ass. You have to watch the house. -Understood? -Yes, sir. -Good. -Excuse me, Lieutenant. [man reading] "The lion tamer at the Gutiérrez Brothers' Circus was arrested in Chiriguaná, Cesar, after a clown accused him of raping him while both slept in a trailer." That's the circus that came here. It was bad, by the way. I took the girls because it was supposedly good, but it was awful. No wonder. I saw how the lion tamer flicked his wrist like, "What a cascade of feathers!" And he was lucky because if lions sense you're a pussy, they try to eat you. I can't remember the clown, bro. What a drunk! I mean, if shit hurts on the way out… Damn! He was into that crap too. Come tomorrow to polish my other shoes, OK? [shiner] OK, boss. We'll tally this week's pay. Bring the bill. -[shiner] Gladly. -Take care. Don Milton! Welcome to the best business in this area, bro. Go ahead. Come in, sit down. What do you want to drink, man? An energy drink. An energy drink. Hey, Pocalucha! An energy drink for Don Milton and one of the green beers for me. They're great German ones. I got an awesome selection of alcohol. I got a great Russian whiskey, bro, in a wooden box. I also got Argentinean wine in a big bottle. I have aguardiente and rum. I got beers from all over the world. Taiwanese, Chinese, Dutch, German. I also got some appetizers. -[Milton] Drink, Mudo. -Sure, sure, sure. I have pistachios, macaroons, olives, artichokes, alfalfa. From Mexico, chili pepper in mussels. I got some cachaça in a clay pot from the Brazilian Amazon. I have anchovies and lobsters too. But tell me, how can I help you? What brings you here? There's a house for sale in Alvernia. Oh, the house for sale in Alvernia. I know whose it is. It's Ortega's, bro. -No. -That's the one for sale. Not Ortega's, man. This one's behind the stadium. -Yes, of course. -To the south. It belongs to Ortega's aunt. -The lady called "Sky Eyes." -No. [scoffs] Not because her eyes are blue, but because they're cloudy. You don't remember her? That one is for sale. Are you arguing with me when I'm the one in the know? -I know they're selling-- -Will you let me talk, man? How could I not know which one is Ortega's house, man? Everyone knows where that dude lives. [sighs] Look. That's the address of the house I'm talking about. [grunts] People are going in and out all the time. Something's going on there, Mudo. I need you to find out, OK? Oh! And that license plate. It's a pickup truck. Find that out for me. OK? [Don Óscar] A bit pricey, huh? [dealer] But it's good stuff. -Let me know if you need anything. -[Don Óscar] Sure. Thanks. [cell phone rings] [Don Óscar] What's up? What did he say? OK, then. Call me when you know something. [Fredy groans softly] [groans] Son of a bitch. Apparently, El Mudo doesn't know anything, but he'll find out. Sir, wouldn't it be better to just pay Duberney? I already told you, I'm not paying those assholes. Got it? -Should we go back to the house? -[coughing] The house? And draw attention to ourselves? Idiot. [sniffs, sighs] What's up, baby girl? What are you up to, babe? No way. Can I pay you a little visit? OK. Sending you a kiss. OK, fine. Two kisses. OK. To Angie's place. -[engine starts] -[radio playing peppy music] Oh, girl. Yeah, he's gonna leave her. -I don't know. She's a problem. -[knock at door] Just a sec. Someone's knocking at the door. Yeah. That guy's in bad shape. Yes, but it's more like… Yeah. Hey, but don't say anything, hon, please. If you say anything, that chick will kill me, OK? Go on, then! Anyway, I gotta go. My boo's here. Bye. What's up with you? Did you forget about me? You don't call or anything. Are you gonna be moody? Come here. -Huh? -[slaps] Are you gonna be moody, then? Look at me. [moans] [Don Óscar winces, groans] No, no, no! No, hold on a minute. No, wait. Hold on. I'm gonna put on a condom. I don't wanna get you knocked up. [breathing heavily] Son of a bitch. There we go. So? Want me to make an appointment? Hello. Doctor, how are you? Well, very well. And you? Well, that's great. I'm glad. Yes, I wanted to ask you a favor. Yes, it's for an appointment. No, not for me. It's for a friend. Do you have any availability late this afternoon, by any chance? What about tomorrow? Tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow is perfect. OK, Doctor. We're set, then. See you tomorrow. All set. Baby. Huh? Will you help me with what I told you about? [breathes deeply] What was that? The university thing. Get out. You study? [ringtone playing] Hello? [Milton] What's up, boss? I'm here. Where are you? Here, at El Pecoso's place. Hey, boss. El Mudo got the info. They're not Duberney's people. Really? [Milton] The house those idiots went into belongs to the SIJIN. It's full of cops. No way. It's a big operation. They're moving lots of people. Even El Mudo said he's going into hiding. Let me know when you hear from El Pecoso. OK. Yes, sir. -Is something wrong, baby? -No, nothing's wrong. Did you get bad news, or what? No, hon. [sighs] I just got into a business deal with a little shit. I never should've gotten involved with that asshole. Why? Because the job went sideways, and he's the type that takes what he's owed by force. -By force? What do you mean? -With bullets, babe. Baby, isn't that very dangerous? -Why don't you call the police? -Are you dumb? Are you stupid, or what? How can I call the police? If I do, they'll come after me. [sighs heavily] See, this morning, when I went outside for breakfast… [knocks] [Duberney] Take it out. Are you looking for El Pecoso? He can't see you right now, OK? The dude is busy. Hey, Milton. You're cool. But tell your fat son of a bitch boss to give me my money, OK? Or I'll get that old fucker too. I'll see to that, you damn clown. [SUV drives away] Hello? [Milton] No, boss. They killed the son of a bitch. Poor dude. They killed him. No way. Fredy, come get me in the pickup truck. El Pecoso was killed. The motherfuckers killed him. Turns out that the assholes next door are cops. Come get me. We'll go into hiding, OK? Baby, take care. Next time, I'll just come to screw, not unload. [chuckles] Don't be silly. Baby… Are you gonna leave me anything? What's up, girl? Hey, I need to tell you something. Yeah, guess what? So this guy just left, girl. [knocking on door] [rap music playing on radio] [cell phone vibrates] Neither of them is answering. So, they kill El Pecoso, law enforcement is up our asses, and the guy doesn't give a shit. Hmm? Look, Don Óscar left us here as bait. What an asshole. El Pecoso was killed? [Claudia] Don Leonidas! [Leonidas] What now? Good afternoon, ma'am. How are you? Please clean up this mess. It looks awful. -[Leonidas] We're just starting. -I want a garden like this one. -Can you see it? -Yes. I want you to plant these bushes here, and over here… -I need to show you the plants I want. -Hold on. Ah… Move that truck because we're leaving. We'll do that later or tomorrow. [engine starts] Damn it! -[band plays mellow rock music] -Brothers and sisters, good afternoon! Hallelujah! [congregation] Good afternoon.

Shouldn't we be shoveling or something to pretend? To pretend, right? Man, do it yourself. It's too hot. [on radio] May the best team win. Bye. [dialing through stations] [mysterious music playing] Hey, man. Take me downtown. -[sighs] -[driver] All right. EL TURCO PAWN SHOP OPEN 24 HOURS INSTANT MONEY WE BUY EVERYTHING SIX-MONTH LOANS -[man 1] She's married. -I'm not jealous. -I don't need a wife, brother. -[knocking] What's up, man? -Someone gave you the money? -That's what I came to tell you. I had a problem with my grandpa at work. Can you give me a few more days to pay? Kid, this is a pawnshop, not a charity. If I felt sorry for everyone who comes crying every day, I'd be more broke than you. Which one's your bike? The blue one over there. FOR SALE I'll give you the solution. Bring the money, and it's yours. That's the solution. Bring the money, and it's yours. OK, bye. Be careful. She will still… [man 2] Hello. How are you? Taponcho, brother! That unmistakable voice! [Taponcho] Hi. How's it going? Did you bring something, or did you come for fun, as always? You heard we opened a bottle, and you showed up. -Imagine how I keep my fat boy. He's huge. -I'm here to help you. -Don't worry. -What's gold going for? [owner] I'm paying 86 for you, brother. [Taponcho] I was able to get some gold for you, thank God, because my aunt died. Go figure. She had some gold crowns in her teeth. They were able to get them before cremating her, and it's part of my inheritance. [El Turco] We'll pay 86 per gram from your aunt. -No problem, man. -[Taponcho] We need it to play. -[laughs] Let's-- -[knocks] Turco. Hey, kid. What is your problem, brother? About the motorcycle. How do I have to say this so that you'll get it? What did I say? Bring the money, and it's yours. Don't bug me. Leave, brother. -You're so annoying! -[Taponcho] Are we playing or not? [El Turco] Sure. Just bring the money that I'll take from you. The food and the bar. [Taponcho] What? But I'll pay you. [somber music plays] [cumbia music plays on speakers] What's up, honey? Sweetie. Are you done? Yes. Let's go. -Hey, babe, where's the motorcycle? -I'll tell you about it. Are you hungry? -What do you mean? -[Yoiner] No, baby, I had a problem. [Mayerly] I'm tired of walking. [Yoiner] I'll tell you about it. [vehicle approaching] [dog barking] -[barking] -[shushing] -[Fredy] Damn dog! -[dog whines] -[dog barks] -[Fredy] Shut up! [Don Óscar] Don't forget to hide the pickup truck, OK? [Fredy] Yes, sir. [key rattles in lock] -Damn, it smells like mold. -Hmm. God bless you, Nachito. May God bless you. Call me when you get there, OK? [chatting indistinctly] [engine starts] No, honey, look, I was working at Don Óscar's house with my grandpa. He asked me to pack up because we were leaving and to get the truck. When I backed it up, I hit a Virgin Mary statue that the guy has there. I got out to see what happened. Lots of damage. I made sure nobody was watching, and I tried to fix it. When I looked inside, there was a black bag. I opened it, and it was full of dollars. Really full of dollars. I got freaked out, so I closed it again. I put it back inside and did my best to fix the statue. I waited for my grandpa, and we left. How much did you bring? [Yoiner scoffs] Are you crazy, Mayerly? You think I want to get myself killed over that money? [Mayerly sighs] [horn honks] [man] Nancy. Nancy, come here. Come here. [clicks tongue] -Do you have the money? Yes or no? -Tomorrow. No, enough with "tomorrow." You've owed me for two weeks. -Go inside the room. -[Nancy] But tomorrow I'll-- Are you listening? Go to the room. If you don't pay tomorrow, get your things and go, OK? Otherwise I'll throw everything out the window, you and your stuff, OK? I don't want to hear you or see you anymore. Lousy bitch. [man on TV] Residents of Tuluá of all ages, regardless of social status, went to the streets of Villa de Céspedes to enjoy the parade, opening the Tuluá Fair, which this year… What happened to Pecoso is awful. …for all citizens. The route, which for the first time covered the poor areas of the municipality, turned Highway 12… Do you know what I recall? One day, at a parade, El Pecoso started bugging a horse… [Don Óscar chuckles] …trying to give it aguardiente. [both chuckle] He kept bugging the horse… until the damn horse bit that idiot and almost tore his hand off. [Fredy laughs] I will miss him. And you, shithead, wanted me to pay that asshole Duberney. Fuck that. He's going to pay me. Son of a bitch. [sighs] [Leonidas] Yoiner, get up. We have to leave. Grandpa, did you plant the gardens in that house? No, they were already there. -What about the Virgin? -Same as the gardens. Come on! [Leonidas] Let's go. Get moving, get moving! No, Don Óscar hasn't shown up since last night. Maybe he's arguing with the missus? I don't know, but Mrs. Claudia hasn't stopped bawling. Don Óscar must be with some girl. Mmm. But he always comes back. Rita! [Claudia, in distance] Rita! [knife chopping] Rita! Rita! Hey. [Claudia] Rita! [Milton] Go! Go to the lady. She's calling you. Can't you hear her? Go, go! So you had a shaved head, a ponytail, and everything? Yeah, a sikha. I wore a sari and everything. [laughs] You wore that little pink skirt? [laughs] Yeah, why? How long were you "Care Crisma"? Hare Krishna, man. Hare Krishna. What? About a year and a half. [Milton] Come, get up. Come on. Don't take your eyes off those guys. I'll be back. I'll go watch from the other side. [imperceptible] [gardening tools whirring] -[woman on TV] Pereira. -[host] Pereira. What do you think? -And you, sir? -[man 1] Yes, sir, Pereira too. [host] How many horses are there? [man 2] Four horses, sir. [host] Teluro Productions, obviously broadcasting the information for all Central and North Valle del Cauca and, of course, the rest of the country at the start of the 61st running of this event. We obviously hope that it fills up as horses have arrived from different parts of the country. Teluro Productions. Mmm. [TV continues playing indistinctly] [Don Óscar] That's all you brought? Mm-mmm. There's also coffee, snacks, and raw cane sugar. No, no way. Go to the village and bring something good. A tamale, some meat. Something filling. Bring a bottle of aguardiente, invite a couple girls. -We look like homos here on our own. -This isn't enough. Then lend me money. I'll pay you later. [host on radio] The most important thing is to be restrained. [Milton hawking] [stirring] Don't ask them anything directly, OK? Just play dumb and look inside the house discreetly to see if there are weapons or other people there. OK? If you see movement, check how many people are there. Are you listening? Yes. You know what? I was starving. I was saved by the Boyacá spaghetti I secretly made. -That saved me. -Boyacá spaghetti. What's that? You haven't tried it? Take some packaged fries and fry them in butter. Once they're brown, add some milk halfway. Not all the way up. Then put the lid on for five minutes. [inhales sharply] That absorbs the milk, and they taste like spaghetti. Oh! But aren't they greasy and sticky? Look, man. I'll make them for you someday. Get ready, get ready! [laughs] [Rita continues laughing] It's tamarillo. -[Milton] Do you hear what they're saying? -Mm-mmm. [Rita continues laughing] [Milton] Why is that silly girl laughing? Man, our cover is blown. [groans softly] Come on, Grandpa. Weren't you rushing me? [engine starts] [Milton] Tell us. What did they say? [Rita] Nothing. What do you mean? You were laughing your ass off. What were you talking about? No, I was-- Who is in that house? Is there anyone else inside? -There's nobody. I didn't see anyone. -[Jenny] Claudia! Wait. Excuse me. [Jenny] Claudia! [Milton] Mrs. Claudia. Mrs. Claudia. -My friend. -My friend. -It's best if you don't leave. -I have a doctor's appointment. -Now? -Yes. -I'll take you. -I'll go with Jenny. I'll take your car and go with you both. Sorry, but the way things are, I can't let you go by yourself. Don Óscar's orders. This guy. That bitch. This guy. What's his deal? I don't know what my husband told him, but he's always on my ass. Well… [engine starts] [fly buzzing] -What about this one? -I'll take it home. We're taking trash home? You are… No! -Grandpa, I'll take that home. -What? But it's trash! Let it go, you old son of a bitch. I've supported you ever since your mom died giving birth to you. Learn to be respectful, damn it! I didn't want kids, and look at me now. [coughing] [music plays on TV] Damn, that's great. [Fredy] What color are my eyes? Kind of green. I lean over, you bite me, know what I mean? -But you won't like it. -Yeah. -Why not? -Because I bite very hard. You like it? Oh, baby, let's move away from here. I don't want to fall into that filthy pool. -I'll get an infection. -Come here. [both laugh] -Oh, you're squeezing me, babe. -Oh? You're squeezing me hard. -Look at all you'll eat. -Mmm. Do you like it? -[cell phone ringing] -[Fredy] Mmm. [woman] What do you think? [ringing continues] -Hello? -[man] Did you get my message? Who is this? Or are you planning on not paying me, fat fuck? [bottles clatter and smash] I'm not paying you shit, fucking asshole. You don't have hairs on your ass yet, you little shit. Perfect. That's fine. Don't give me anything, OK? But I will have your fucking wife killed, you hear me? Why do I have to pay that little shit? Tell me, man. Why? -[woman] Come on, baby. -Don't interfere, bitch. I'll count to three! You have to the count of three, bitches! One… [screams] [footsteps receding] [continues screaming] [Fredy] Don't run. It'll make it worse.

[Claudia chuckles] Don't start with that crap about loving me and all that. Take me home. [ignition clicks] [removes key] And why not? [sniffing] At this building in Entre Ríos, police discovered the body of Ángela Álvarez, a business administration student who was murdered inside her apartment. According to an initial report by police, the young woman's body had been there for at least 24 hours. Investigators noted that, although there are several apartments, nobody saw or heard anything suspicious. Affectionately known as Angie by her friends and family, the young woman had turned 22 just one week ago. Those who knew her… You killed her? …described her as nice, friendly, sociable, but dedicated to her studies. You should've seen her. [on TV] Police say signs point to… She looked like she was sleeping. …which would explain the presence of the murderer at the home with no signs of a struggle or neighbors noticing anything unusual. That's all for now. Reporting from the scene of the crime… Why did you kill her? …Robert Posada. I'll tell you something. Sometimes it's your life or those of everyone else. Fucker, you haven't gone to get the money. Nachito. Why don't you come? Let's go for a walk somewhere. We can go to the movies, then we'll go eat something real good… and… then we'll come back here for a nice screw. No, love. With the situation here? Oh, Nachito. I assure you that with the Lord's help, we'll soon find a way to have a little country house so that we can cuddle up together. Don't worry. OK, honey. I love you. I love you too. Bye. Kiss. [suspenseful music playing] "Lest strangers feast on your wealth and your toil enrich the house of another." [dogs barking] [dogs panting happily] [barking] Come here. [laughing] Come here. Come here, Morgan. Morgan, come here. Morgan! [barking] [Bobolitro laughs] [exclaims] [Bobolitro continues laughing] Morgan! Morgan! -Morgan! -[dogs barking] Morgan! [thuds] [dramatic rhythmic music playing] [sniffs] [exhales, grunts] [ringtone playing] Fat son of a bitch. [phone vibrating] [both moaning] [phone vibrating] Leave me alone, man. Man, you really are Black, huh? You walk through the door, and I only see your clothes. You're like the Invisible Man. I think you could go into that house for an undercover operation, man. You could go in naked at night. We'd shut off the electricity, and no one would catch you. But you couldn't laugh, 'cause you'd screw it up. [both laugh] [sighs] PAWN SHOP INSTANT MONEY SIX-MONTH LOANS OPEN 24 HOURS JEWELRY, WATCHES, DIAMONDS, GEMSTONES I BUY GOLD AND SILVER -Good evening. -Good evening. -Where's El Turco? -I don't know. Do you know where he could be? -Maybe at a pool hall he has. -Where is it? Mmm. Thank you. -Hello? -[Claudia moans] [Bobolitro] Where are you? Where would I be, man? Here, at the gym. With Mrs. Claudia. [energetic music playing from gym] With what's happening, why would you take her to the gym? I need to tell you something. We'll talk when I take her home, man. OK, bye. Tell me, what's going to happen between us? Nothing will happen, Milton. You'll keep working with my husband, and I'll have an abortion. We have to end this shit. Look me in the eye. Look me in the eye and tell me you don't love me. Look at me. Is it because I'm not good enough for you, or what? Because I'm not the boss? Tell me. Come on. Tell me, come on. Tell me. Good evening. Excuse me, I'm looking for El Turco. El Turco? Who is El Turco? He has a pawnshop around 28th and 26th, and he has a pool hall too. I don't know him. Do you know him? No. Thanks a lot. No, man. I don't know him. -Thanks. -No problem, man. Why don't you go to the main bar, bro? Maybe they know him there. OK. Thanks a lot. [Bobolitro breathing heavily] [engine shuts off] [door opens and closes] [Milton] Claudia, come. Come on, let's talk. Claudia. Come here. You scared me, man. Why do you have the lights off? Don't you realize we're in a huge mess? I'll turn them on. [Milton] Why did you call me? No reason. What's up? Move! [rain pattering gently] [sighs] [ringtone playing] -Hello, love. How are you? -[Claudia] Hi, love. How are you? Are you stupid? Are you stupid? Why are you calling me, idiot? Do you want me to get killed, bitch? You want to get me killed? [Gamboa] Hey. It was fine for the ones who got bread, but it was hard for the ones who got the fish because you need a knife to remove the scales, then you need to gut them, then a pot to cook them. And at that time, where would they get all that? Hey, man, the guy performed the miracle with cooked fish, dude. So, he multiplied the fish, and… [exclaims] they were cooked. Yeah. -Where does it say that? -It's the word of God. Look, it clearly says, "God almighty, creator of heaven and earth." Look, he created the seas. He created the planets. You don't think he can perform a miracle with cooked fish? -Mm-hmm. -[scoffs] [laughing] [knock on door] -[Rita] What's up? -[Bobolitro] I'll be back. Don't open the door for anyone, OK? [Rita] OK. -Isn't that the fat guy? -Mm-hmm. Everyone is leaving. These guys are leaving the house unguarded. [music playing from bar speakers] -Hello. -Hello. -I'm looking for El Turco. -Don Nelson? -Yes, ma'am, Don Nelson. -Who's looking for him? Tell him it's the bike kid. Wilber, is Don Nelson here? Wilber! Is he here? Uh-uh. I have some money for him. He said he needed it urgently today and that I should deliver it in person. I don't want to get in trouble. You know him. [Yoiner] Thank you. Do you think that guy Óscar cares what happens to you? Huh? Did he care that El Pecoso was killed? Come on, tell me who looks after that house every day while that asshole hides from the thugs and the police. Huh? That's what Milton told me. [Nancy] At least he has a reason to be there. But you? Or did you think Milton was castrated? Come on, tell me where your country houses, your yacht, and your penthouse are. Something that makes it really worthwhile to get the money for that man. [sighs] No way, Nacho. I'm too old to be a whore. And you? Any day now, they'll capture you, lock you up, or kill you… and then what? So what should I do? CUEROS STRIP SHOW [dance music thumping] Rata! What's up? Rata, I need to talk to Duberney. [groovy rock music playing] [yelling] Was it before or after this corner? [Yoiner] Calm down, girl. I went to the pawnshop. It was closed. I'm heading to El Turco's house. -Once I have the bike, I'll pick you up. -Yoiner, listen to me. Let's go to the station, get on a bus, and go to Cali. We'll exchange the money there. It's already late. There's nowhere to exchange those dollars. Well, we'll exchange them whenever you want, anywhere, but what matters is that we leave Tuluá. -[knock at door] -What's wrong with you? I won't give my motorcycle to that Turkish motherfucker. Yoiner. Yoiner! [mouthing] [hip-hop playing over car stereo] [players shouting] I don't know where the guy is, but he's with Fredy. When he returns, I'll let you know, and you can follow him. Hey, and why do you want to betray your boss? The guy's lost his mind. The gang's getting dangerous. I don't want anything to happen to me. Actually, if there's a chance I can work for you, let me know. I can do whatever. [El Turco] Feed the fat guy, man. -[Taponcho] Add some lime. -Some more. [man] Let's remove the fat. [El Turco] "Let's remove the fat," he says. Son of a bitch. He already ate half a plate. -[doorbell rings] -[door opens] -Good evening. -Good evening. -Is Don Nelson here? -Who's asking? Tell him it's Yoiner, the motorcycle guy. He knows me. Let me see if he's here. Thank you. [groovy rock music playing] Shit! What are you doing at my house, brother? Turco… Don Nelson, I got the money and wondered if you had a moment to get the bike. What an idiot. Does this look like a pawnshop? It's my house, bro! What's wrong with you? I'll pay you in dollars. You are such an idiot. You think I've never seen a dollar? I won't give you shit. [Milton] What's up? What? Bobolitro isn't there? Bobolitro? [groans] Come here now. Holy Mother of God! Man, no more interruptions. Who needs you so badly? You have more snakes here than Chocó. Some stupid kid. You have to ignore these idiots. [groovy rock music playing] Where's that little shit? That asshole will pay for this, no doubt, bro. [laughing] [comedian on TV] She's so ugly that I take her to work every day so that I don't have to kiss her goodbye. It's really something. -[audience on TV laughs] -So ugly. -[phone vibrates] -We have our share of fights. During a bad argument, she said, "Before marrying you, I had four boyfriends that were smarter than you." I said, "Sure, they were smarter. I was the only idiot who married you." [continues laughing] Nothing? He's not answering? Call him again. Mmm. Hey, how much to go to Cali? Hey, how much to go to Cali? Oh, man, I don't have a permit, but hold on. Hey, Pantera! Take this guy, man! [phone vibrating] [comedian] Believe it or not, I also met college students. When I arrived in Bogota, the first thing I did was go to the university. I started, it went well. I sold all the empanadas. [laughing] [suspenseful music playing] -Drop me off at the corner, please. -Sure. Right here. [shifts gear] [phone rings] The ones that laugh are the ones who've gone dancing. LOVE He said, "Honey, I'll take you to an after-party." I didn't know what that was. I thought it was a fast-food restaurant. I was excited. [audience on TV laughs] It was a dance hall full of smoke. Lights everywhere… [line ringing] Can you wait for me for a minute? You won't be long? -No, I'll be right back. -OK. [door slams shut] [gun fires] She paid for her room, grabbed her things, and left with the… -With the fat guy. -Mm-hmm. -[Milton] How long ago? -About two hours ago. Do you have money? [clicks tongue] Thanks, man. [Milton sighs] Now we have to face Don Óscar. Let's not tell him anything until we have the money. Hey. Where are we gonna find that fat asshole? He… is a man of faith. -[spits] -[church organ plays] DIVINE REDEEMER CHRISTIAN CHURCH [Fredy] The old man was messed up, you know? Shooting the girl the way he did… Then he was calm, as if nothing had happened. I was terrified. No way. And then sad… crying. Do you know why? 'Cause he killed Angie, the escort he fooled around with from time to time. Those whores brought coke. -[static crackles on TV] -[rooster crows] [Fredy] That man snorted like crazy. The guy has problems with that. He needs help. [broadcast begins on TV] What is up, motherfucker? [reporter on TV] Attention, the DIJIN and the Attorney General's Office managed to capture this dangerous criminal gang, which you can see behind me, in North Valle del Cauca. Among them, the capture of the man nicknamed El Mudo stands out. These people are charged with adulterating alcohol, which was produced at a house in the city of Tuluá and was then delivered to bars and clubs all over the Valle del Cauca region. It's a dangerous criminal gang, which police are also accusing of homicide. They are here, at the first precinct, where they are being presented to the media, and then they'll be taken to the Prosecutor's Office, where they'll be brought before the judges in order to establish their legal situation. You can follow all these events… ADULTERATED ALCOHOL GANG CAUGHT …and learn more about this adulterated alcohol gang from Central Valle del Cauca during our broadcast. [tense music playing] [jets passing overhead] [prompts horse aggressively] [horse whinnies] -[kicks] Motherfucker! -[dog whimpers] [phone vibrates] Hey. It's Don Óscar again. [phone continues vibrating] Hey. When we get the money, we'll give it to him. [phone stops] [lighter clicks] [fan whirring] [ringtone playing] -Hello? -[Milton] Good morning, sir. This is Milton. -I'm with Fredy. He knows everything. -Let me talk to him. Sir. No, sir. It's close. After leaving town, to the right, there's an unpaved road, and about 21 meters up, there is a yellow gate. It's there. [engines revving] [Fredy] No, he's alone. He has a gun, that's it. Exactly, that's what we don't want. More trouble. OK, boss. Thank you. Sometimes it's your life or those of everyone else. Don't think about that. That guy was going to get us all killed. Look what happened to El Pecoso. -And the police were already on our heels. -No, that guy is nuts. Or he'd end up killing us, like with the escort. In a fit of panic. Besides, he isn't a good boss. He isn't. Good boss, my ass. He treats us badly. Do you know who he treats like shit? Mrs. Claudia. He yells at her in front of everyone. He tells her, "Shut it." I think he even hits her. Poor Mrs. Claudia, right? Not really, you know? That lady is nasty. The boss found out she was screwing a big Black guy named Mandingo at her gym. Really? Yes. Bobolitro and I had to kill that Black guy, you know? And, believe it or not, Bobolitro is vicious. He turned on a drill, inserted a bit, and shoved it up his… [continues imperceptibly] [preacher] …love and what, brothers and sisters? Hallelujah! BECAUSE WHERE OUR TREASURE IS, OUR HEART WILL BE TOO. Then I remembered the words of our Lord right away… -[band plays mellow rock music] -…in Revelation, chapter three, the letter from Jesus to the churches. It is the warning message from our Lord because he was truly convinced… he was sure that, at some point… the devil… would come. [gasps] [preacher] The devil with all its tricks to attack the church of Jesus, our Lord… Satan, to take away the power from the church of Jesus, our Lord. -He won't be able to! -[congregation shouts] [man] He won't be able to, brother! [preacher] The devil and the apostles, fake apostles, super-apostles, and messengers of death, to persecute Christians, brothers and sisters. -Hallelujah! -[congregation] Hallelujah! To sow grief where there was life previously, brothers and sisters, because resignation is dangerous, brothers and sisters, resignation kills because with resignation comes carelessness. I'd go to Argentina with that money. I've always wanted to see Independiente play in Avellaneda. Palomo used to play there, Palomo Usuriaga. -Get myself some Argentinean ass. -[moans softly] I don't know why, but I think those girls are more easygoing than here. They're sassier. The problem is that once you leave Tuluá, you're nobody. [preacher] Because the devil is just around the corner. The devil… The devil knows how to penetrate the souls of believers to poison them. No, brothers and sisters. We must be armored. Humans lie down, and the devil rises. Humans close their eyes, and the devil opens them. [Milton] I'm getting out of the business. I'm not working for any asshole, especially not a pretty boy like Duberney. Imagine your boss plucking his eyebrows. No way. [scoffs] Humans sit down while the devil dances. Humans sit on their hands while the devil sharpens its claws. That's why I tell you, brothers and sisters, "Protect your soul." "Protect your heart!" "Because Satan stretches out his hand, and he calls you to rebel!" Brothers and sisters, Christ is your shield, your spear, and your sword. I'll set up a spare parts shop. Like a dealer, something like that. I'll buy some land, build a small house. I haven't told you, man. What? I'm going to be a dad. -[gun fires] -[people screaming] -Fucker! -[gun fires] [heavy metal plays] -[screaming] -[preacher] We'll prevail! [preacher in demonic voice] ♪ We'll prevail!
