[MUSIC PLAYING] -Dear friends, we are gathered here today with the blessing of the Almighty to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony. [GUNSHOT] [SCREAM] -No. No. No! [LAUGHING] -Hey, ain't Johnny coming out? -Let him have a little fun. -Let him be, Trinity. Not here. Don't go up there. This thing is between you and him. Don't let us get mixed up in this, Trinity. [LAUGHING IN ROOM] -Come on, have a drink. -No thanks, hun. [GASPS] [GUNSHOT] -Hey, Jessie. You see who just rode in? -Yeah. It's Trinity all right. -Well, hello Trinity. -Is Ben around? -He's in there. -Hey Trinity. Well, by gum, I just can't believe it's you. Now, come on in. Sit down and have a snort with me. I know it's been six years but it seems like only yesterday. Now, come on. Sit down. Take a load off your feet. Another glass of whiskey for my friend here. Here you are. -How's Norma? -Oh, she went and bought herself a ranch near here, Trinity. Calls it "The Green Circle." About 30 acres. Nice spread. She took the kids there. But then when the word got out she should have been arrested, the Murdoch brothers burned the place down. They ain't given up on you. They're just itching to collect that reward that's posted on you. -That friar was a framer. They had everybody rigged including the judge, I reckon. They wanted to hang me so I had to bust out of that jail. -Sure, I understand. But you're in danger here. -So are they. -You're only one man, Trinity. You can't fight the Murdoch's alone. They got this territory in the palm of their hand. Look, Norma needs you. Go to her now while you still got the chance. -I don't think she'll take me. -I'll do anything I can. Only go now. -You ain't leaving so soon. Now that would be a real shame. -Don't be a fool, Trinity. There's nothing you can do now. -He was my brother. -Please stay here. Another killing won't bring him back. For my sake and the children's. -I'll be back, Norma. -They'll bring you back in a coffin, Trinity. That's how. -Get up. I told you get up. -I got a gun on you that says I ain't getting up from here and that you better get out, Murdoch. Now skidaddle. [GUNFIRE] -You had better clear out. When the Murdoch's get wind of this all hell will break lose. -Thanks, Slim. -Good morning, Sheriff. Here's your man. He's outside. -You always bring them in like that? -Why, sure. That way they don't make noise. And I don't need to feed them. So long, Sheriff. -Hold on, Scott. You ever heard the name Trinity? Trinity Harrison? It might be worth your time tracking him down. It'll bring you a $5,000 bounty alive. -That's big money. I'll bring him in. -This character ain't no fly weight like that old runt outside, Scott. -Give me some credit, pal. -Make it 10. -I'll raise you. -Here's 15. -I want to talk to you. -Yeah? What about? -Alone. You know Trinity Harrison. -I might. -Well, I want to see him. -Well, he ain't here. -But you do know where to find him. -I ain't saying I don't. In case I do, what's it worth? -Oh, $100. -But why not $200? -$100, that's all. Come on outside. Here. Now tell me where that man is. -I heard he was heading to Texas. -Texas, huh? Know any more? -No. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Yeah. As I was saying, what more might you know? -Nothing else. That's it, mister. -Well, you better give me back my money. -Here you are, young fellow. This stuff should burn the dust off your hide. Say, where you hail from? -The north. -Just riding through? Or you going to stick around? -I don't know yet. I just could be needing a room. -Don't think of settling in this town. It's a lawless place. -Then I guess I'll keep going. Oh, and by the way, I'm looking for a spread. The green circle. Happen to know it? -Sure. If you ride due south, it's just off the road. Ain't far. -You know the proprietor? -Well, the place is owned by Norma Harrison. She's a widow with two children. -A widow? -Mm. -Blinky, quit chewing the fat and set them up down here. -That's the scum that's wrecking this town. -Hey, get a load of that. There's Mr. McKinley. -Hm. -That's a surprise. I heard the ladies sewing circle meets today and I figured that you'd be right there. -All right, Ross. Cut it out. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Sure, we'll leave him alone as soon as they decide to smarten up and get out of this town. Ain't that right, McKinley? Well, now. -He just means to rile you. [CHUCKLING] -Temper. Temper. -The kid is right. You got a fiery temper. -One of these days you'll have it coming to you, Ross. -Really? You going to sick the kid on me? -You're a dirty pig, Ross. -You're insulting my friend. [GUNSHOT] [LAUGHING] -It's all right, son. [LAUGHING] -How about that booze, Blinky? -Now, don't you fret Norma. I'll take care of it. You know I'd do anything just to see that pretty smile of yours. -You have been so kind, Mr. Scranton. I never could have rebuilt the ranch if you hadn't loaned us the money. -Norma, must you pull away every time I-- -You know how truly thankful I am for the help you have given us. Don't ask more than that of me. I've really got to go in now. There's so much to be done so please forgive me. -Good day, Norma. -Good day, Mr. Scranton. -Take it easy, fella. Good boy. Hold it. Whoa. -Yah! Yah! [LAUGHING] Which one do you like, Jimmy? -The colt. That one! -Look, son. A present from me. Hop on. -Jimmy. Jimmy. Hold on. Don't you know me? Or don't you want to? Stop pretending and look at me, son. Can't we make friends? You've never forgiven me, have you? -No, dad. And I don't think you should have come here. -I had to. But the main reason I came here was to help your ma and to make things up to you. -I see. You rode away six years ago. You didn't care then, why do you expect us to be glad to see you now? -How could I stay and let him go free? The man who killed my brother. -Who is it, Jimmy? Jimmy. The cows need milking and you might as well feed the pigs. -You haven't changed, Norma. -Why did you come? -Because I thought you'd take me back. -Put up your hands, mister. Don't move or I'll let you have it. -You run along, Betty. And don't be a nuisance. Now go. -Mm. Bang! Bang! Bang! -That's Betty? -Yeah. She's our baby and she doesn't even know who you are. I told her her father was dead. Or do you think it would have better if I had told her the truth-- that you abandoned us. -I did what I had to do. -As far as that goes, you know perfectly well how I feel. -Norma, so much time has passed. I'm asking you to take me back. BETTY: Bang! Bang! Hit the dust! You're dead! -It's too late now. We suffered so much all these years for you. -But every day that passed I thought about you. I couldn't rest easy until I found you again and asked your forgiveness. Norma, please trust me. Can't you give me this one chance? You won't regret it. -I learned to manage without you very well. I'll be quite all right on my own. -Norma, wait. The kids need a father. -He's dead, remember? -Hey ma. Can't he stay here and work with us? -I'd have liked to, Betty. -But mister, why are you going away? -Your mother objects. -You know I can't pay him. -But we need a good hand to get the ranch working again and you can pay him later for his chores can't you? -I said no. -There sure is a ton of work we go to get done around here. We can't do it alone. -No. I think we'll manage it alone. -If you'll agree to help us out now just for a few dollars a week. We'll pay you more as soon as we can. Huh? -Maybe I can. Your mother has to decide. -Come on, ma. Tell him he can stay. Go on. Tell him, ma. -You do it. -Wait, mister. You can stay. My mom said yes. -You won't be sorry. I swear it. -Come on. I'll show you around the ranch. My name is Betty. What's your name? -Just call me Joe. -I think you're going to like it here, Joe. -I know I will. It already feels like home. -Come on! You can put your things in there. -Thanks Betty. NORMA: Betty, go help your brother. -Oh, OK ma. -What is it, Jimmy? -It looks like you have forgotten all that we've been through. -I haven't. Please. You must give your father a chance. -He was our Father only until the day he abandoned you, ma. He's no more than an outlaw now. -That isn't true, Jimmy. He just made a big mistake. -I can still remember how you pleaded with dad not to kill that man. And he just rode off without caring what happened to you or us. And you always said that you wouldn't ever want to see him again. It didn't take much to change your mind. -Jimmy. BETTY: Hey Joe, need another log? -Thanks Betty. You're a big help. You're a strong one. I bet you could build this fence all by yourself. -Maybe. I'm already used to working with my mom. Anyway, the more that get's done, the sooner we can pay you. -Don't worry. Your mother's credit is good enough for me. I'll wait. -You can count on it, Joe. She lives up to what she says. I've never known my ma to break a promise. -It's a good ranch. Know what I think? Sometime soon I would like to get a place like this. -But it costs a lot to get a ranch. Mama says that's why she had to sell all her belongings when pa died. Hey, ain't you got a family, Joe? -No. Hey, Jimmy. Would you mind helping me out with this fencepost here? -I can't. I got to go feed the cows. -I don't think my brother likes you very much. Ever since you got here he's been acting real funny. -Oh, never you mind. One of these days your brother and I will be friends. Well, how about a siesta? I think we've earned it. Say, I got an idea. Let's go get the fishing poles and catch your ma a nice mess of trout for supper. -I was fixing to ask you, you got firearms? -I thought you'd ask. I buried the ones that I had. -How many did you bury? -A Winchester and a Colt. But I'm through with guns. I'll never use one again. -Do you really mean that? -I swear it, Norma. -The minute that you use a gun again you can pack up and go. -Give me a shot of your best corn. -Yes, sir. -Well, I'm turning in Blinky. -See you tomorrow, Joe. -I've seen that face before. What's his name? -His name is Joe. He works at the Green Circle ranch. He just got to town a few days ago. -I got to find a man-- Trinity Harrison. He been here? -Let's see. Trinity Harrison. Mm mm. -Look, somebody told me he was coming to this town. -So, lots of strangers pass through this place. -There. This job is done. It will be a nice surprise for your ma when she gets back from town. -Do you want a drink, Joe? -No thanks. -The water is cold as ice. Hey look there. Someone is coming. Hey. Where are you going? -What are you doing here? -Just a little social call. -You can turn right around and ride out. -Now is that a way to talk especially since we came around to offer you a good price for this broken down old ranch. -I thought I made it clear to you boys. I told you already I wasn't selling out. My father built this ranch with his own hands. I ain't got any attention of going. And I don't reckon you can bully me into it. -Then you just keep your cattle away from our river. -You've got no call to say that. It's against the law. -That's right. Only we write our own law. -Why you. -Glen! -You varmints. Get out of here. -We'll be back. I'm sure you'll agree to sign the ranch over to us when you've had more time to think about it. -Easy now. I'll do it. -Betty, wait. -You want to lie down inside? -No. I'm all right, ma. -You shouldn't have fought him. -Ma, we had to. -But Joe, how come you didn't help him before? -It all happened so quick, I didn't get a chance to, Betty. -But you could have tried I imagine. -We got to get help from the other ranches. Those men are going to be back. -Let me ride. I'll tell the others. -I'll come too. -No. You've got to stay home. It's much too dangerous. -Joe can do it. You'll help us out, won't you? -I will, Betty. -I knew you would. Mr. McKinley, how many families are in the valley? -Nine. -Those men will murder them all. If you want my advice, you'd better sell out. -You think I'm about to allow that chiseling bank of mongrels to buy us all out? -Don't listen to anything Joe says. I don't think he's man enough to care anyway. -If we're united, we can lick them. -But what will you fight with? Your hoes and plows? -Don't worry about a thing. I don't see how you could do anything to help us anyway. -Remember Jimmy, no good ever came from violence. -You'll help us, won't you Joe? You'll teach those bad men a lesson. -I said I'll do what I can, Betty. But first we got to get to repairing the barn. -Say, mister, can I buy you a drink? -No thanks. -Mind if I sit down? -Not at all. -Haven't I seen your face somewhere? -Sure. Up on the mountain. You were riding with a dead man to keep you company. -Each man has his own way of making money. -Just what do you want? -I'm looking for a man. -And what makes you think that he's here? -Well, I don't know. I don't have much to go on. I only know his name is Trinity Harrison. You know him? -No. -They say he's gunned down a few people in Arizona, but what's more important is the law is offering me $5,000 to bring him in. -Who did they say he killed? -I don't know and I don't much care. -I can't help you out. -Thanks anyway. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] -Send it to Sheriff Sheridan, Canyon City. -The message? -Just say urgently request more details about Trinity. That's it. -Sign? -Scott. -Let's see, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. $1 sir. -Keep the change. -I'm sorry, Jimmy. I'm stuck to the roof. I really don't need any more of your vegetables. -But you told ma that you needed another load delivered by tomorrow. -Look tell her that I just got in a lot more merchandise than I figured on right now. She'll understand, Jimmy. I'm sorry about putting you in all this trouble. -I'm beginning to understand. Come on, give me a hand. You forced him not to buy from us. You sure like bullying folks don't you? -Now, now. We're mighty sorry about your disappointment. Thompson, he just changed his mind I imagine. Huh? Didn't he? You surely ain't going to blame us for that. -It seems clear to me you're doing everything to drive us ranchers away. -Selling cole slaw? I'll make it for you. -Let go of that. -Pig. Beat him up, Jimmy. -Didn't you hear your sister? -Why you-- -Go away, you bullies. Pick on somebody your own size. Go away, I said. Stop it, you hear? [LAUGHING] Leave our stuff alone! -Come on back to the house. I'll take you. It's best. -I'll make it alone. I don't need your help. -Listen, kid. Go tell your ma that she better start thinking about leaving. We'd be interested in buying her out. -Yah! Yah! Get up there! -Tell your sister it's time for supper. What's the matter? -He saw all those men ruin all our things and he stood right by and let them, ma. -Who did? -Dad. And if you don't tell him to take his gear and go I promise I'll go. -Please. Now calm down, Jimmy. And tell me what's wrong. -Ross threw all the vegetables on the road and all did was to tell me to go back to the ranch. -Wait, Betty. I'll help you. -Ma, Joe saw those men throw Jimmy down. And he just stood there. I thought he was our friend? -Betty, those men always carry guns. What else could Joe have done? -He could have acted like a man. -Don't talk that way. Perhaps when you're a bit bigger you'll understand why Joe had to act that way. -Then you don't think Joe is a coward? -That's right, Betty. It took a lot of courage not to fight. -Give me a beer. -Coming up. -You knew in town, fella? -Yeah. The name is Brandell. I'm looking for a guy by the name of Slim. I was to meet him here. You seen him around? -He ain't in but I know he's expecting you. He told me to have you wait in his room. It's number five just at the head of the stairs. -Thanks. -Hey Brandell. SCOTT: Brandell. Step outside. I want a word with you. [GUNFIRE] [GUNSHOT] -You remember me, don't you, Brandell? I have been tracking you for a coon's age. We've got a little business to settle. -I'll come quietly, Scott. I ain't shooting. Don't kill me, I'm wounded. -You have ten seconds. A draw or run. -Don't do it. [GUNSHOT] -Just a minute mister. He was already wounded so you could have brought him in alive. That was cold blooded murder. -He wasn't worth much. I only bring them in alive when they pay more. -Don't worry about getting rid of those ranchers, we'll put the message across to everyone. As soon as we fire the first shot they'll scatter like jackrabbits. -I don't wish to use force until it's absolutely necessary. Which ones are giving you the most trouble? -Old man McKinley and that widow. They're sticking to their guns all right. Oh, and there's one more thing. The widow has gone and hired a handyman. Real tough guy, ain't he boys? [CHUCKLING] -I want all that land. You've got to get them out. The widow owes me money so I can deal with her easy. As for that McKinley, here's an idea I've got. -Hey Slim. I want to talk to you. -The widow's nurse maid wants a word. -Oh, well, how about that. -Well, let's listen to what he has to say. -I have something here for you and your friends. It's $2,000. It's yours if you get out of this territory for good. -Well, what do you say? -Well, not a bad proposition. But if we was to get out of this territory, folks would say that we were yellow. And we wouldn't want anyone to think that now would we? -Hey. -Let's chuck him in here. I think he'll be comfortable. Sweet dreams, sucker. [CHUCKLING] ROSS: Hey, Frank. Open up! -What the hell do you want? Banking hours are over. ROSS: Mr. Scranton sent us over with some gold. He wants you to put it in the safe. -I'm coming. Hold on. ROSS: Hurry up. -Just a minute. -Inside. -What do you fellas think you're doing? -Just keep quiet and you won't get hurt. Get over there. [CHUCKLING] [GUNSHOT] -Frank? Oh my god. -You better send somebody for the sheriff. We just caught a bank robber. -Ross, what happened? -McKinley busted into the bank and he just shot poor old Craig. -I'm innocent, I tell you. I was framed. -Where is the body? -There. Right where McKinley left him. -Why'd you kill him? -But he was dead-- -Hold it. -I didn't do it. -McKinley you must be lying. He was carrying this. -Is this your gun? -Yeah. -It's just been fired. How'd you get that? -I don't know. They must have planted it on me. -We found the cash in his pocket, sheriff. You don't need anymore proof than that. -Good work. I'm putting you under arrest. -Norma. Listen. I hear you hired a stranger to help you out here. I would have preferred you to consult me first. -As long as I still own this ranch I will make the decisions here. -Norma, McKinley has been arrested. They say he robbed the bank and killed Craig. They're about to hang him. -Glen. They've arrest your father. There's not a minute to lose. They're going to try to hang him unless we do something quick. -My dad? But why? -They say he robbed the bank and shot Craig. You've got to move fast, Glen. You get ready, you hear? Take your pistol and meet me by the gulch. OK? Go on, now. Hurry. -Come back here. You put that gun down. Just where do you think you're going, Jimmy? -Stay out of this, ma. -Answer your mother. Hey, simmer down. -Don't push me around, you hired hand. -You might get in trouble with this. Here. Better hide this somewhere. -Ah, ma, you mustn't let him boss Jimmy around like that. -Joe is right. He's trying to protect him. -But if he touches Jim again the way he did, you got to tell him to go away from our ranch. -Don't you see, Betty? He just did it for Jimmy's good. -Slim! Come out and fight! -Take care of him, Ross. That kid is starting to burn me worse than a saddle sore. -You lied about that killing. You know damn well my father didn't have a thing to do with it. He wouldn't harm a soul. -Go speak to the sheriff. Don't bother me, sonny. -You're the ones who killed Craig and then you framed dad. -Now, how do you figure that out? Say, you ain't trying to scare us into confessing are you? That ain't going to happen. Now ride. -I ain't going. I came here to fight. -Oh, I ain't in the mood, kid. -You pig. You just better be. You ain't getting away with this. -Is that so? Well, if that's how you feel I guess I'll just have to oblige you. Hurry up, kid. My barber is waiting. [GUNSHOT] You saw it. The kid drew on me. It was self defense. [LAUGHING] -Chick. Chick. Chick. Here you are. Come and get it chickens. -Well, I'll see you tomorrow, Betty. -Wait. I don't know how to thank you properly for all that you've been doing. It hasn't been easy for you I'm sure. -Better keep an eye on Jimmy. He seems to be taking the McKinley boys death very hard. -I will. Don't worry. -Good. -You drop around my office and see me later. -Right sheriff. [LAUGHING] -What's your pleasure, Joe? -Coffee, Blinky. -Sure, Joe. -I can play today. -Yeah, play. [DISCORDANT PIANO] -Have a look over there, Slim. -Yeah. Well, I'll be. Look who dropped in to keep us company. I reckon we should invite him to have a drink seeing as how it's his money that's buying. Hey, Joe. Hear what I said? Come on over here. -Here's your coffee. -Are you deaf or something, Joe? I thought he just asked you to come buy a drink for us. -I ain't buying any drinks. -Get out of here. -You ain't being too polite, mister. I thought Slim's offer was pretty generous myself. -I guess it's safe for a guy to be sassy when he ain't got a gun. -The only thing he's proven to us by not carrying a gun is he is a yellow dog. Go on, Ross. Keep playing. -Cowards wear guns too. -How do you mean that? -I mean the kid that was killed. Nothing but a coward could have murdered that boy. -I hope you can back that up with a pistol, mister. -Just keep cool. -By the way, I still want my money back. -What money? -The money you stole. [LAUGHING] -Hey, Ross. You hear that? -Do you mind saying that again? I didn't get you the first time. [LAUGHING] -Put that gun down, Ross. I don't want no trouble. -All right, Blinky. Though I still got an itchy finger. -Are we done? -He's crazy to take on those three. -Here. Let me help you up. -I'll bet you $10 Joe whips the lot of them. -You're on. [LAUGHING] -Kick him outside. -Now just hold on a minute. I'd put down that gun because that man is unarmed. -All right. Pay off. -Bang! Bang! The Indians are chasing us! Bang! Bang! Here come the reinforcements. -Hush, Betty. Hey, what happened to you? Looks like you hurt yourself. -Oh, this? The horse had a bad spill. I banged myself up a bit. It's nothing. -It looks like he got a good punch to me. -What really happened, Trinity? Tell me the truth. -Norma, listen to me. You'd better sell the ranch and move out as soon as you can. -Mr. Gregory, what in the world are you doing? You didn't tell me you were going to give up the ranch. -I'm not going to no more funerals and I don't want anybody coming to mine. We're moving over to the next valley where there's plenty of land for everybody. [GUNSHOT] -What's that? Where's Jimmy? -Stay here. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Where did you get that gun, Jimmy? -It's none of your business. -Don't fire that again. You can hear the shots all across the valley. -What's the matter? You afraid is going to come and scare you away? -You can't learn to shoot in the day, Jimmy. -I got to since there's nobody else here who will protect ma and Betty. -A gun is not meant to be used by just anybody. So be certain that you don't make any mistakes. -How do you know about pistols? -I used to be a gunman. Remember that? [GUNFIRE] -Gee, you're really good. But you let those men tear up all the stuff we brought. Why didn't you pull a gun? -I can't tell you now. You wouldn't understand. -Sold out? -They won't. Not if they want to keep McKinley from being hanged. -What are you figuring on doing with that land once it's yours, Scranton? -The federal government is very interested in it to the tune of $200,000. They're planning on building a railway to the west coast. -That's big money. And our cut is $10,000. Isn't that kind of skimpy to split amongst the three of us? -That's the deal we made. -Yes, sir. That's the price we said. And a man is bound to keep his promise. -There will be a nice little bonus for you, Slim, for doing such a good job on pinning Craig's murder on McKinley. -That scheme was damn clever. Nobody even heard the shot. Know how we did it? We put the cushion. [GUNSHOT] -It just arrived this morning, mister. -Here's the key. -Good night, Blinky. -Good night. -You know him? You'd better go down and settle up your bill. We're moving out now. You've got five minutes. -Thanks. -Don't try anything funny. -Not in there, friend. Out this way. Move along. -Well, if it ain't the nurse maid. You might actually come in real handy right now. You see the little lady back there is being mighty stubborn. All we're asking for is her signature on a piece of paper. I bet you know how to persuade her to cooperate. BETTY: Ma! Ma! Let me out of here! Ma! -Go on. -It's a pleasure. -Make that fuse long and lasting. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [LAUGHING] -Ready? Aim. Fire. [LAUGHING] -Come on. -Yeah. -Here's the deed. Signed and sealed. She didn't need much convincing. She came around all right when I told her the handyman's life depended on it. Sorry I'm such a liar. [BOOM] -Well, it's a miracle he's still alive. I'd say he's been very lucky. Although the burns are only superficial, he shouldn't be moved for at least 24 hours. Now, I want you to make sure of that, Mrs. Harrison. -Yes, doctor. -I'll stop by later. Good day. -Good day. Where you going Jimmy? -To drive Mrs. McKinley to town. She wants to speak to her husband. -You know you haven't been to see your father. -If it hadn't been for pa, Glen would still be alive. Yeah. But you'd have been dead. -I hope he gets better real soon, mom. He's a plague on us, because the quicker he gets better, the sooner he'll be gone. Yah! Yah! Don't you mind, Mrs. McKinely, I'll think of up a sure way to get your husband out of there. And you can tell him I said so. -Oh, dear. [SOBBING] -Hey, Joe. Look what I found. They're yours aren't they? -Yeah. Look, put that under the bed. -I remember a couple of the things you said last night. You sure do talk a lot in your sleep, Joe. Know what about? -What? -You talked about having a ranch and two little children. But I guess that you kind of made it up because you told me that you don't have a family. -I was dreaming of a friend of mine. -You know what else? You went on talking about Jimmy and then about me. And you said that you loved us both very much. -I won't deny that, honey. -Tell me all that happened to the man. That is, the guy in the dream you talked about. You said that he went after some very bad men who had killed his brother and he couldn't come back to his family because he'd gotten away. -Yes. -Was that true? -That man made a mistake. -Why do you say that, Joe? It seems to me what he did was right. Wouldn't you do the same thing if someone harmed us? I'd like to meet your friend. He sounds very brave. -You ready? -Sorry, Betty. I must go now. -But where are you going, Joe? -I have a little business to take care of up north. [LAUGHING] -No. You can break every bone in my body but I won't sign that deed. I won't sign it. -Oh, please. Please don't hurt my husband. Let him go! -We'll let him go when he decides to cooperate. -No, you don't scare me. -Make it easy on yourself, sister. -You wouldn't want to make a lady a widow would you? -Oh, no! -You let my wife go. -Sign it, Horace, or they'll kill you. -Hear that? Your old lady is smarter than you. -Sign it and we'll let you go. Otherwise it's going to be a funeral. -Maude. Maude. -Sign, old man, or we'll kill you now. -Let me go! -Let him go! [LAUGHING] [GUNSHOT] -Take cover. -You won't be needing this now. -Dead? -Yeah. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] -We're going to hang you tonight, McKinley. Listen, sheriff, we're going to be needing your cooperation. -They sent word unless we all get out by 6:00 tonight he'll hang. Those men are ruthless. I know they'll go through with it. -They're just bluffing. -Yeah. We got to stay here and fight. -Can't you people understand? Then they'll hang McKinley. -They're going to hang him anyway. Why it's plain as day. They're trying to trick us into giving up our land. -It's clear to me those men want to provoke us. -They're using McKinley as bait to drive us out. -What have you got to say, Frank? -Why, sure, Jedd, I want to save McKinley. But how? -And you, Patterson? -Hm. -What are you doing, Jimmy? You better give me that. -No. If you want the gun you'll have to take it. -Give it to me. -No. No. I won't let them hang Mr. McKinley. -Give me that. -Hi. Where you going? What'd you bring your gun for? -To kill rabbits, Betty. -Rabbits my foot. That's a lie. I think you're planning to rescue McKinley. -Do what I say, Betty. Take care of your ma. She needs someone to depend on. -Anything the matter, Joe? -Nothing. It's been nice knowing you, Betty. -Why don't you stroll over to the bar, sheriff? -I guess I could use a drink. -Here, McKinley. Come on. Let's string him up. -All right. Finish it. Hold it. Don't poke your nose into this. You'd better go back to washing widow's babies. -You might think different since I was the one who shot your man. [GUNSHOT] [GUNFIRE] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] -Come on. Move. -Sheriff, I believe these men are worth about $6,000. I'll come back for it after I've collected my bounty on Trinity here. NORMA: Trinity! Trinity! Trinity! -Hey pa, wait. -Trinity! -Wait, pa. -Trinity. -Pa, they're all saying how brave you were. You hear? -Pa, don't go. Say you won't leave us again. Stay with us. -I'll stay.
