I want scotch whisky My goodness! Great! Although I enter the bridal chamber every night I never forget the fettered Baypoint folks They are bound but they are very decent For example, you are a positive energy girl On the surface you are a good wife And a good mother to the lovely children But you are a slut Don't lie to cover up, we are the best friend You are as lewd as me Your 12-year-old fantasy is enough to make a prostitute face red We were really frivolous girls back then I forgot Class of 1968 look at you! look at me! I look so ugly Sad, only Priscilla Sams's photos are beautiful See our 67 years of cheerleading Bunch of ugly ducklings Why are cheerleaders more beautiful today They eat better and sleep better Baypoint is not!

Great We are going to get dressed, they are coming You know she is back is not it Priscilla, Tracey, you and me! Pool at Jones Beach We are so ugly Was only 9 years old Only Priscilla is a beauty embryo Real little princess Don't worry about Prissy She never said anything to you Someone said I was dismissed My parents have no face to see someone move to Florida The whole city laughs at me My friends said why i came back Don't blame Priscilla, she is a good woman Yes, she is a good woman, just superficial Inside she is as lewd as we are Remember that time you seen Tracey and her in the yacht club bathhouse?
