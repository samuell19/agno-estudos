I think there are family skeletons buried everywhere. So that's why you cope with those nagging patients? Everybody's got secrets, and I want to help unravel them. It's what I want to find out, so I can maybe do something. Okay, then you can start with this dream I had. I can't take those dreams of yours. -Come on, we run farther away here. This isn't just any dream. I'm in a bookstore... ... and the front page says: The Story of Your Life! Yes, Daniel, and it is! -Any pictures in it? -No, not a kid's book. And I start reading all about my life, when - Everything in my life is there, I scroll to the last page to see how it ends. - suddenly I hear a girl saying: "don't read that last page!" I feel both horny and sick because there is a girl,- - who looks just like me, leaning over to - -Check this out! -Look at that! - kiss me, and I want to since she's so cute...yet - - it's disgusting to kiss oneself. What does the dream say? -It says "Janne", see? -A tiny little heart. You should speak about this on the radio tomorrow. Why? Talk about a necklace? You can ask if anybody lost it. What kind of new policy is that? Why not keep it? Keep it? There's a name engraved. It's more fun to talk about the dream. Somebody owns it, it says "Janne", right? So? Because of a girl's name we start giving things back? Of course. What about all the coins we find, they all have kings names on them? Say a tooth of mine hurts - suddenly my sister has lost all her teeth. If my head aches, she has a brain haemorrhage and so on. No matter what happens to me, it's always much worse for everybody else. -Right, but isn't it good ... -Good?! That you don't have... any problems. I want us, the family, to go to that farm, and live there. I want Margit to grow up on the farm. With animals around her. You've grown up in town, right? In Oslo? And... -...that worked out? - Yes, fine. Do you know what that bridge is called? That bridge there? -E18, isn't it? -E18? You think a bridge is called E18? It is The Highway Bridge. Do you know how many bridges there are in Drammen? There are five. Do you know what they are called? Highway, Point, Longisland Railway, and City Bridge. -Listen to what you're saying! -How is your ... daily life? Is it good? Do you love each other? Of course. But we're not here to talk about that.. Listen, could you call the Asylum and have me admitted? Yes! Get me into that emergency ward! ...and then call my sister and mother! -No, I can't. -But you're a psychologist! Help me! Yes, but I can't send you to the Loonybin - straight away. Good Morning, you're listening to Ronny at Radio Illegal - - and you're in time for an important message: Yesterday, me and my pal were out searching with metal detectors - - and we found a heart! A silver necklace! So my psychologist pal, who's really into getting under the - - surface of things, said he wanted to keep it - - but I said: we must find the owner! Coz here we have - - an engraved girls name. So if you are that cute girl - - and know the engraved name, please call me, Ronny. In the meantime I'll tell you about a dream. I was in a bookstore... -Aren't you eating anything? -No, just coffee. Just coffee and cigarettes? Nice and healthy. You fell for dad. He smoked. What's that got to do with anything? You always get so quiet, whenever we talk about him. I've told you I didn't know him very well. But you think it looks cool when I smoke, don't you? Look! You do! Met anybody lately? -That weather reporter is deranged... -What? -Gordon says she's been treated by us. -Are you listening to me? -Hm? -I asked if you'd met anybody recently. Nothing compares to you, mum. Right. -Would you like a drink, coffee, water.. -No thank you. I'm fine. Well... How do you say it... I'm a bit inexperienced with this situation... So this is your first time... It's the first time, yes, it is... No. Yes? Well, it's like this... No, this won't work. -Why not? -No, I'm just a little touchy. I'm... unprepared for this. I'll be back some other day. -Yes of course. It's up to you... -Yes, that's right, it is. It's as if I can't get through to them. I don't know what to say... I can't get any closer. There's no contact. You're just scared, but that'll pass. Do you want to see the flat? Yeah, I don't know. They say it's not the right time to buy. Who says? Nah... people. You mean your mother. Yes. She's mistaken. Mothers often are. When I was living at home, I left home at 17, right. Not like certain people... I had a nocturnal emission - - and went to the bathroom to wash, the sheet was a little, sticky, and - - when I got back, my mum had hung the sheet up in the backyard - - and gathered a bunch of neighbours, to - - celebrate the arrival of my manhood and they kept singing... You've been dreaming again? Yes. So, remember the board meeting next Tuesday. We also - - have a request from Ante Danielsen. -Yes. Who is a private detective with something of interest for our club. -Danielsen? -Thank you. Where would you bury something you didn't want found? A deserted place? Precisely not. You'd bury it where nobody would look; The subject's own property. Almost genius. These are the teeth of Gunstein Drag, three months before he disappeared - - full of amalgam, a metal. And if I understand correctly, you can find metals in the ground? That's all we do. Ten years ago, Gunstein Drag disappeared from a farm in Asker. First the dog disappeared, a mongrel. Then the tractor disappeared - - a brand new, red, Fiat Agri. Then Drag himself disappeared. He hasn't been found. Nor has his dog or tractor. Now the wife is dead, and I was contacted by the daughter; Hege Drag. The expiry date of the case is drawing close, and she wants it solved. She is in the dark. I have conducted some investigations: The neighbour, Martinsen, is hiding something. He's a suspect. Thank you. I have to get him on my radio show! Is anybody interested? I am. Hi, Daniel. Hi, Ronny, a pleasure. Good morning, Ronny at Radio Illegal, a bit excited, coz - - I'm in love. A girl called to claim the necklace. She sounded really cute, and smart, wise and all that. Anyway, last night I dreamt that I was playing football. I was fullback, my dad was striker, and I had to mark him all the time. -Daniel? -Yes? Listen, I've been thinking, I thought of buying some paint for upstairs. Yellow, not too bright, but warm, dark yellow. Wouldn't that look nice? Mum. I spoke to Gordon and he told me that, well... He offered me a flat. He said that... It'd be a good place to live, alone. Didn't you hear? I'm redecorating! We've never spoken about me staying here. The point is I want to ...leave home. I've thought about it before as well... I'm 28, it's not that strange. So move. Nobody's stopping you. -Don't be like that. -But really. I've said so many times. You always do everything at once. You've just got a new job, you should relax - - take one thing at a time, Daniel. Be patient, we can talk about it later. Okay. So how's life in the social welfare department? Hi! -I haven't booked, but... -Excuse me? Sorry. I didn't book. Your secretary... Oh yes, that's fine. -Did you draw this? -Yes, drew, or got someone else to. -So you've got your own company? -Yes, in Stockholm. Why are you showing me these? Maybe they say something about me. Okay, what do they say? What do you think they say? That you're ambitious, creative, - - brave... Those are your words. So what are yours? Well... I wonder... Yes? If you'd like to go fishing with me? -Can you take care of this courier? -Sure -Hi. -Hi. I'm here to pick up a necklace. Do you know who for? I called... it's for me. Oh, I thought you were collecting, I'm sorry. Please come in. Maybe you can tell me what it looks like? It's a silver chain, silver - - heart, round, pretty big - - with a little tip, which is crooked. And it's engraved. Yes, and what does it say? Janne. Incredible... So, it is yours. Well, I polished it a bit, there was dirt on it. We found it - - with this metal detector. -Thank you. -Oh, it's nothing. Bye... Hey! Janne! Coffee? We stop serving in 20 minutes. I think it'll rain. -Sure, we'll finish it. -Having a bad day? Fucking city slickers. Can you see right through people? What do you mean? I mean...can you tell if people are lying? Sure, I can see you're lying right now. Just joking. That's not how it works. Then how does it work? No... I help people who need to talk, - - make them talk. -Silver doesn't rust. -No. Like ... No. Feeling kinda limp, I went to the shrink. He said: "You're underrating your sexual instincts. You want her in bed. Better behead her, before you bed her." I want you, can't have you. Too retarded to reach you. You claim you're lying. Faking it big time, before you finally pull out So tell me, was she good? Are you keen on her? -Maybe. -Really? That's cool. Come talk about it on my show! -Why not? -She'd never... -'Course she would. -She's not the type. Not the type? What do you mean? Tell me! Did she say anything about me? Come on! Tell! Are you seeing her again? -Yes. -Yes?! I found the necklace too, I have a right as well. Wait! Holy shit! Here are the boys who'll find your dad. Here's Daniel, and this is Ronny. Hey, Ronny. Hege Drag. -Daniel, hi. Let's try this. How do you start it? Good lord! -How did you end up being a ... -Private detective? -Yeah? -I've always been into espionage. -Yeah? -Look here... I started to solve cases back home; vanishing snow-scooters, dinghies. Did you find anything? Well, you know the plains are so wide and the coast very long, but.. I did find her; Anja from Karasjok. Got her sent back home. She'd got lost in this town. But the best part of this work is all the ladies. Really? - They think there are no detectives in Norway and there I am! That's something for Ronny. -Did you find anything? -A nail. Martinsen - that devil's got it coming! -Hello? -Hello! -Oh, it's you. -What are you doing? -I'm decorating. -What for? I got an idea. The wall between those rooms - it has to go. -We should've thought of that before. -But we haven't discussed this. -Think how nice. -And what's this? -Just some old film reels. Ancient... -From dad? -Don't throw them! -They need a special projector. "Mommy I'm gonna be a policeman", remember? -You're not throwing them away? -Course not. They're going to the attic. -What about this? Gorgeous. -Chuck that. It's ugly. -Have you tossed anything else of his? -Relax. Sometimes you're so sentimental. You must promise to tell me if you find anything else of dad's, okay? Yes. Good morning, you're listening to the excellent Radio Illegal. The guy who found that girl's necklace is engaged to her! After one date! A new record! We'll be following this love story. But first, we have a genuine Lapp in the studio. -Welcome, say hello! -Hi, and thanks for... -And what's your name? -Ante. Ante. Great. Really? To Norwegians, all Lapps are named Ante. Yep, that's right. Okay Ante, we all want to hear a joik. -Come on - joik! -But I wasn't supposed to joik here. We've always tricked the natives. Go on - joik! No, I can't joik on command, you have to understand. -So what makes you joik? -Well, outdoors, when you're in a - - good mood, or perhaps had a drink... -Okay, so you want booze. What should we talk about? -Do you have to use that tone? -What tone? That shrink tone. You know why I'm here. I chose between therapy and prison, so here I am. So, let the clock tick. Do you know what this is? My file? It says that you've abused a child psychologist. Is that true? Does it bother you? Don't you have any set questions? My relationship to mum and dad? Sure. How is your relationship with your dad? I don't have a relationship with my dad. I bet you have a complex one, - - being a shrink and all. I don't have a dad. He's dead. There you go. It says here that you've been around... As a Satanist for one. How's that? -How is it to be a shrink, really? -How is it to be a Satanist, really? Well, y'know, it's... Hell! Are they shut? Okay. Put'em on. Now open your eyes. Feel forward, close to the ground. -Can't hear anything... -Can't you hear a hush? Wait, now I hear something. It's beeping! Look, it's here! -And what happened afterwards? -Well, he went to China - - with a group of student architects, who rebuilt a storm damaged village. They were all commies. How idealistic! That's what communism is, pure idealism. He saved a little girl before he died, so we got a letter of sympathy from Mao. So how did your mum take it? She - - doesn't talk much about him - - I don't think she's quite over it yet. -What about you, Daniel. -Me? I never knew him. -How sad. -Maybe. -What's wrong? Don't you like classical? -Can't stand the flute. Why not? Do you want to stand up? Free as a bird! Great! So I don't really know what to say. I mean, it's not common practice to - - go fishing with your clients. It's unusual. Eventually you'll end up in peculiar situations where - - you'll have to decide if you're ready for it. If you are, then give it a try. I don't really know what's involved. I can't decide, Daniel, you have to do it yourself. Consider where you're at, how far you've come. I just don't feel like I should reject him. It's not a rejection, however you should judge this carefully. It's part of your job, which gradually becomes part of your life. You should... I think you should go for it. -You do? -Yes I do, but I can't make you. I can't tell you to go fishing with him. Go fishing with a patient? Cool! -Would you do it? -Sure. If I got paid. What if he's a serial killer from Sweden. Remember the Nordstrom case? -Nonsense. -He went fishing. -He murdered his shrink? -Hey, you're not doing it right. You're supposed to search north-east. Give me that. It's wrong. Let's practise; hiking in the woods while talking about emotions. -Wildlife therapy. -I've had another dream. Thought so. -I'm living in a dormitory. -You're in my way. -I'm searching here! -But you're waving all over. I'm supposed to. I'm in a student flat. Right across the hall there's - - this guy who always wants to wrestle. -You keep walking in my way! -Sorry! One night he turns up. I hide behind the PC, but he floors me. While he's got me in a half Nelson - - his fiancee unzips my pants, - - pulls out my member, - - studies it carefully, kisses it, and says: "You're my new fiancee". What does that mean? -What? -You're too primitive. -Why? -How long since you had sex? -You mean with a girl? -How long? -7 months. -Exactly. -How did you do in the bushes? -Didn't find anything. Here comes Hege Drag. She's cute, but I don't think she likes me being a Lapp. -Waffels anyone? -Yes, please. -Please help yourself. -Did you make them? Keeps me busy. -Did you know that Ante is a Lapp? -Yes. -Did he tell you? -Yes, we've talked. Good morning, I'm Ronny. School has ruined a lot for the Lapp-community. I remember decorating little Lapps and reindeer... I'm sorry, Ante. I've sort of turned Lapp overnight... Ante, and I have worked up the right mood - - for a joik... we may not be outdoors, - - but we've been up all night, catching up on the booze - - so, Ante, it's all yours. A son joiks out to the plains - - after his father never returned from hunting. -Anything you wish... -Shush. We've been sitting here for three... Grab the net! Look... A big one! Get me the bait. Bait! Thanks. Okay. What you do with the fish, - - is not my business, but what do you wish to say? What do you want me to say? Well, that's up to you. That I'm dying of cancer? Sometimes it's nice to be with someone, - - quiet. Here in the woods, - - by the lake... I miss nothing. Nothing. -I really want to do this on my own. -I want to see this. -I'm an expert. I know what to look for. -What's that? -Well, the mail. -Leave it! -Hi. -Hi. Well, this is my mother. -Gordon. -Camilla Jor. Welcome. Come in. This was outside. -So, here we are. -Goodness - it's big! -Did you catch anything? -No. Did you know he had cancer? The best thing for him is to speak to you. -Don't you trust me? -Well, sure... -I'm looking for the water heater... -It's behind the wall. Is it nice and big? -It is nice, big and old. Golden and oldie - but still working? Look at these windows! They're the main feature here, really. The big windows and all the light. -Yes, but it is pretty old. -Yes - old and nice. -Yes, nice. -Nice and cold? Yes, it can be chilly, but a little extra heating does the trick. -But the windows are nice though. -Yes. But, - - how's Daniel doing at work? -Oh, very well. He's a little young to have his own practice, - - but it's fine. You must have been a good mother. Yes, well, I did my best. And very young... Well, maybe too young when I started. I think we've had enough now. -You've had enough! -He has had enough. At least that's settled then. What? It was far too light and big. I don't think you'd like it there. -You sure acted like you liked it there. -What?! I was acting normal. -No way; you were showing off to Gordon. -I most certainly was not! No. Our house is quite different. A nice atmosphere, Daniel. -I liked it there. -Do you have the key? -That necklace is a cool story. -Yes. -Would you talk about it on the radio? -No, I wouldn't. -She wouldn't. -Apparently not. -But cute. -Fine? Just a little bit big. -I've had a new dream. -I can't take another of your dreams! -This is an amazing dream! -No way! -What's this? -No! I had a dream. A dream about a guy who's never fucked, who works in radio, - - uses all his sexual energy to pick on people, is called Ronny - - and has a reddish beard, thin, fluffy hair, drinking coffee... -Right. Here's my dream. -I don't want to listen. -But I think you... -I don't want to hear! -Yeah, but... I dreamt .. -Can't hear you, can't hear you. -Hege Drag was driving a bus. -Blah, blah... No, this is hell ... -Hege Drag was a busdriver. -No! It's beeping! 22 Calibre. Amateur. That idiot has buried the dog where he shot it. Amateur. Now we've got him. About the dog, is it? I shot it. Big deal. Are you turning me in? We've got you now, Martinsen. You probably sold the tractor, but where did you bury Mr. Drag? Drag fled the country. If you'd met his wife, you'd done the same. You're walking on thin ice, Martinsen. By the way, Daniel here's a psychologist. -Hey, Gordon? -Yeah? I'd like to check out your flat again. With your mum? -No, thought I'd do it myself this time. -Good idea. Say hello from me. -Hello. -Hi. Where are you going? I'm gonna do some measurements. What? -Sorry. I just remembered the time I came into your room - - when you were... -Measuring? -...measuring yourself, remember? -That's not what I'm doing now. -Look, I bought you some wine. -For me? -Why? -Well, I thought we could share some. Listen, who's that sitting in the car? -Let's deal with that some other day. -No, let's deal with it now. -Some other day. -Now. How nice to meet your girlfriend... Yes, you too. ...a girlfriend, that doesn't happen every day. I mean, it's a while - - since you had any girlfriends around. -So you're a bike courier? -Yeah. -Right. And that's exciting? -Mum! -I'm sorry. -It's not exciting. -It isn't? -No. -So it's not really what you want? -No, I want to study. Right. Oh, you've really hurt yourself - Oh, that... Can I see? It happens...when riding... Right. Well, I thought about architecture. Oh, architecture. That's exciting. Yes, I think so. Yes, just like Daniel's dad. Yes. But I thought I'd stay away from China. Yes. -You saw how she reacted, right? -Yes, I did. -I find that China story a bit strange. -Yes. It is strange. It is. Daniel! Listen. I really fucked up. I know that. I'll buy you dinner. Chinese. If you'd known his wife, you'd have bailed out as well. -Yes, but did he look like a murderer? -A typical murderer? Don't know. Like psychopaths, you never know who they are. They can appear friendly and approachable. -Kind and polite. -Yes. -Charming and... -Sure. Socially intelli... -You done here? -Well, not quite... Can we have the bill? And another bottle of wine? -Same kind? -Yes, whatever you've got. -Was he happier today? -Always happy as Larry. I'd love to live here. With me? Yes. -Hello. -Hi. -Listen... -Yes? Where were you last night? I've been... I've been out. I don't understand... Wasn't there a phone where you were? You usually call. -I got worried, you know. -Well, you had no reason to. Mum, I'm almost thirty. Stop worrying about me! It would be nice to know if you're dropping out on me. -I'm not "dropping out." -I get worried! You're irresponsible. -I'm not "dropping out"! -You could have called! -Don't you understand that I worry? -Yes, but you shouldn't! Shit! I've had a great time, okay? Okay. You have to stop worrying about me, okay? Yes. That's... ...great. -Have you been waiting long? -Twenty minutes or so. So, how are you? Me, I'm fabulous. Would've been better not having to come here. Fabulous... I didn't think Satanists could feel fabulous. And what did you do last night? Why do you ask? -Did you have a visitor? -I didn't say that. I know you didn't say that. I can fucking see it a mile away, man. -I've seen freshly fucked people before! -Oh, what do they look like? I'm looking at one right now. I see... Come on; look me in the eyes and say: "I didn't get laid last night." I didn't get laid last night... That's more than you did, you bastard. You should get laid more often. -Why's that? -I prefer you like this. -Hi there. -Hi. Now, how's it going? Oh, don't know really. Come, I'll show you an old trick. Repeat the last thing the patient says, in a serious tone - - that gets them going. Isn't that Roger's method? And a little outdated? No, it's a classic, my boy. You won't need to listen too closely to what they say, just repeat. Now, how's your mum? How's my mum? Are you asking if she's seeing someone? And the flat, is it looking good? -Yes, it'll end up nice. That's great. Comfort is important, you know. And water. Water is important. Sometimes, when I'm feeling good, I go for a little walk - - sit in a cafe, read the paper... -Or come and say hello to you... -Sit in a cafe; read the paper. Yes. I read about architecture, film and sometimes politics. Film and sometimes politics. -Is this something you've just started? -What? The repetitions. You keep repeating the last thing I say. It's actually a bit distracting. They've bloody well destroyed all of this town. They just build shit everywhere; hotels and crap. -I never even thought of it. -You haven't?! It's intrusive. It's just a building, like most buildings. Look there, it might not be totally successful, but at least it adds something to the city, frames the church tower and they've created a plaza there. But this - it's a shambles! It doesn't say shit. No symbiosis, no genius loci, no concept, only details. Classicism, minimalism, scaffolding. -This is imbecilic post modernism! -I see... They want details. I'll give them bloody details! See, so ... Look, there, that's good. Hey! What's going on here? No, we're fine. I'll look after him. He's not quite well. We'll need a car, can you get us one? -But upstairs is almost finished! -This is not about upstairs. So what is it about? It's about me moving out. So you've bought that flat, have you? Yes. -You have? -Yes. And your bike girl? What about her? Is she also going to live there? Yes. I hope so. It's a strange thing we're buddies, Daniel. -Why's that? -We're different. Did you notice, Janne? -No? -We're... I don't make any money; Daniel makes loads. Daniel's a psychologist; - - I bullshit on the radio. -And I'm trying to take this seriously. - and you're not. That's different too. I take the playful approach; I dance on down... -You're not even using that thing. -Is Daniel as grumpy when he's naked? -You don't know? -Why're you asking that? One needs to talk, you taught me that. If you keep it all inside, it builds up and explodes. -What the hell is this? -It's beeping like crazy. Can I be a kind of supervisor? -Come on Ronny, use your cup. -I hate the first shovel. No, he's not inside. Nobody's there. Yes, it's a red tractor, a Fiat Agri. You must come and identify it, okay? Martinsen had something on Gunstein Drag. It could have been many things, but he made him bury the tractor. And then he waited for the insurance, got hold of the money and killed Drag. -But what about the dog? -He shot that as well. -That theory of yours doesn't quite gel. -It's a shitty theory, Ante. Yeah, it stinks. Hege is coming. Someone must tell her there are no fathers buried here... Gunstein Drag buried the tractor, tricked the insurance company, and ran. Ergo no dad, no insurance. Poor Hege. Daniel, you're a psychologist. Do you have any tricks? -No. -I don't mind, I'll tell Hege. -I can do it. -I really want to. I know what to say. I want to as well. You can't have your way just because you're indigenous. -You've got to understand that. -You went too far this time. Okay, let's decide this with stone, paper, and scissors. -You ready? -Yes. One, two .. -Do you know how to do this? -No. -Well, you won. -I won? That's good. Okay, but remember: in a 100 years your race will be totally extinct. We'll see about that. I am going to reproduce for sure. I am going to fuck. I will do it with Hege. But first I will comfort her. Then we will do it. -Insurance swindle, bloody farmers. -Poor, poor Hege. It might not be too hard for her after all. What do you mean? Well, after Ante's been there... Right? Do you think they make a good couple? Do you think we make a good couple? Good morning; Ronny at Radio Illegal. It's a nice day, and God, I'm asking you; two people find a necklace. One of them gets a girl, and they're probably kissing and dancing as we speak. The other one is stuck in a studio. Is he bitter? A bit, maybe. And then I feel so... It's just...when I arrive on the train from... -From Drammen? -What? What did you say? Why did you start talking about Drammen. I thought we were talking about my mum. Did I mention Drammen? Why do you say that? Would things be different if I was from Oslo? I'm supposed to feel stupid because I'm from Drammen? -Where are you going? -You can go. I'm asking you to go. -I'm asking you to go. -I can't hear you. -Can you leave! -No. Then I'll leave. You can't just walk away! You're no good, you never say the right things. I don't need to come to you. I can go to other psychologists. We happen to have psychologists in Drammen too! -Was that Hanne? -No, Janne. -No, we haven't. -You sure? Yes I am. -Perhaps she cycles for another company? -I don't know, try someone else. -Are you sure? -I know the names of my colleagues! -Yes, okay. -Listen, I've no time for this. -Yes, no, thank you. -Bye. -Are you sure there's no Janne? -Yes. -You know them all? -Yes I do. You'll have to take the courier that's free. They're all nice. Thanks. Feeling down, Daniel? Why do you ask? You seem a bit puffed. Yes. Can't we just... -Sit and be quiet together? -Yes. Shut up a little. Thank you very much. Hi! What the hell are you doing here? Putting up curtains. Nice? How on earth did you get in? I borrowed some keys from Gordon. -Gordon? -Yes. He asked if I wanted to have lunch with him today. -Tell me. We shouldn't have any secrets. -I know. I try, but it's not that easy. Can you leave the keys when you go? Yes. You have reached a crossroads, Daniel - - one road leads to heaven and one leads to hell. Here, you meet two identical brothers. One of them always tells the truth, the other one always lies. You get one question, Daniel. What's the question? Did I get it? What is it What are you doing, Jorgen? It's an experiment; finding the way to hell. What's wrong with you? You're struggling, man. Have you ever felt betrayed? ...so that's it. Everything happens at once. Not much to do about it. Pull yourself together, man. Everything can be fixed. You just have to start somewhere. I think you might be misguided? Tight? Let's stay clear of Daniel's mum, okay? Jorgen! What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Damn! Telling private... That guy is no longer a client, he's a patient. -He's transferring... -He's not transferring anywhere. He happens to be the healthiest client I've had in a long time. And if you have any more spare keys, be sure to give them to me. I've lived in Oslo. In the late sixties. Architect-studies had a good name here. At least I didn't behave like an idiot, demonstrating in the streets. I just studied. Then what did you do? Well, I went back to Stockholm. Dad was ill, and... And then he died. -Did you get on? -No. We couldn't stand each other. He wanted me to study something totally different. I don't know what. That was always the case, always something different. Architecture was stupid. For poofs, he said. Then he died. Sounds classic. Well, I don't know how classic it is, but he died. -Why do you say it's classic? -There's no contact until too late. Is that something you've experienced, or have you read about it? My dad died before I was born. I see. Illness? No, in China, in a flood. He drowned. -What on earth was he doing in China? -He was helping to rebuild a village. He saved a little girl before he died. We got a letter of sympathy from Mao which I've got on my wall at home. There you go. A devoted man, a hero. I've heard that drowning is a fairly comfortable way to go. There's no pain; you just slip away... Yes. I've heard that too. You just slide... This is something I've wanted to give you. It's just for fun. A snapshot. Well, Daniel, there was something I wanted to say... -Wait! Can't you wait? -Can you return during visiting hours? Hey, wait a second! We're talking... -You can do that later. -It's important! -This is important too. -Five more minutes won't hurt! Hi. The usual? -No thanks. Do you read Chinese? -No, I'm from Bali. From Bali? Sorry. Do you know anybody who does? Father not good, mother not good. Mao is very good. Propaganda! Daniel, you're here. That's nice. Is there anything you feel like telling me? Well, Gordon was threatened by one of your patients? That's pretty serious Daniel. What are you looking at? Tell me about my dad when you were with him. Now you've grown silent again. I've told you about him before. -I want to hear it again. -What... -Did you love him? -Yes. Where was this picture taken? It's by Bonntjern, a lake. Your father loved to go fishing there. If he were alive today, would you be together? I loved him very much. He studied architecture, - - and we fell in love. At least that's what I thought. But... No, we probably wouldn't have been together today. I'm sorry. Did he know about me? Did he know that you were pregnant, before he left? No. Did he hurt you? And that girlfriend, did she hurt you too? So he went to China, and then he died? Daniel speaking. Hello? -Daniel, it's me. -Janne? Where are you? -I'm sorry I left. -But where did you go? I've lied to you Daniel. My name's not even Janne. What? I'm sorry it turned out like this. -But where are you? -I can't tell you, because he'll... Who? Janne? Where are you Janne? Do you want to have a chat? -No, not really. -Okay. This is for you. Hello. Am I interrupting a psycho session? -Hi. This is my boss. -Hi, I'm one of Daniel's clients. He cured me. I had Down's syndrome, and now ... ... I feel fine! Marks nothing to it, so ... -Sure, you'll be okay. Good bye. -Thank you. What a good vibe! You been with Janne? Haven't seen you in 4 days. -Maybe we could go detecting? -I've gotta go. -Where are you going? -I'm going home. Do you want to stay here? -Sure, I don't mind. -You could take care of my patients. -You have more patients today? -Sure, I'll ask them to come in. Great...I'm not too keen on incest victims and... -Piece on dream interpretation; page 1. -Here? Aha, so that's how it works. Thank you. First row - good view. Yes... Thanks for the concert. It was great, you were very good. So, who were you waiting for? No, it was that ... Just someone who... didn't turn up. You can't trust a bicycle courier. You know Janne?! That is not her name. Her name is Silje. You see, a girl should only have one boyfriend. Not two. A pity. How are you feeling? I called your office, they told me you were here. What happened? I've been a coward, Daniel. Such a stupid coward. We met when I lived in Oslo, - - we were together a few months. It was nice. She was great. But we were very, very different. And then I left for Stockholm, - - with her best friend. It was pretty brutal, but that's how it was. What I didn't know was that she was pregnant. I didn't know at all. When I finally found out, I... Well... I didn't do anything. -Can I help you? -Yes. Can you take him away? You're not supposed to be here, so you must come with me. Daniel, what happened to you? Check this out; no coverage up here, then four marks here, but ... -Ouch! What happened to you? -I'll be fine. You know anything about this guy? -Sure. Kenneth Isaksen, the flautist. -I know that. Do you know anything else? Of course. He's big abroad, and he's been on.. ouch... -Been on? -This looks bad... Been on a tour of the States. Got back, - - last Tuesday. -But what happened to you? -I'll call you. It's not very easy to call me, it depends on how... I'll call you, okay? Then I'll have to stand where there are four marks all the time. I'm sorry, I can't help you. A week ago, things would have been different, but... I need a clean record. I'm applying for the police academy. If I'm not accepted, I can farm the earth. Plenty to do; plowing, harvesting. Here you go. Thanks. Please, help yourself. We are getting married. -Congratulations. -Thanks. Janne? Daniel? Hi. How are you? You can't be here. He's on his way... Hurry, Daniel! Janne. Janne! Sit down! I'm telling you! Bitch! Jorgen! Daniel! You look like shit! You ready? We could have fixed this a long time ago. Daniel, meet Duus. Hi. Sorry... Matti, also called The Pain! Daniel. Hi, Ronny here, a pleasure. Ronny here. I'll be doing some recordings, don't mind me. Won't be in your way. I'll be lithe as a cat. Yeah, but we're not giving any names. "No name." "What's your name? No name." High five! Where are we going? Get her down here, so I can talk to her, and calm her down. -I'll come up later, ok? -Relax, Daniel. -And try to be diplomatic. -Diplomacy is our strength. What's happening? You can't just break in like this... I'm not even Janne. -You can't do this... -You know what? -Daniel, you can not just come ... -Do you know what? You've turned my world upside down, - - no matter what your name is. My mother's name was Janne. Jorgen! Get him up. Jorgen! It's no use holding him under water. Come on, one finger? What about a little toe? Kenneth, look at me. If you call Daniel, or the lady, I'll cut off one finger. If you try to look them up, how many fingers will I take then? -Two. -Two. And if you touch the lady, I'll take the whole hand. If you cut off the right hand you can still play piccolo? Silje! Good morning, Ronny here. I've been busy dreaming, - - but now I've looked reality in it's evil eye. Extreme acts of violence flourish in the music! In the woodwind! I've been through hell so that you can love undisturbed out there. Here's a song for the lovers... "Daddy come home..." -Why won't you speak to her? -Because... Hi Well, hello! This is my father. This is... -Janne? -Silje. -I'm sorry? -Janne, Silje. The same person. Oh, it's the same? -Are you alright? -Yes, me, I'm fine. Of course, it could be better. It's not exactly the Hilton, but - - they sort of keep it under control. It's fine. But God! Here I am, just prattling on. You must have better things to do! Get out into the sun, and have fun! -We just wanted to say hello. -It was nice to meet you. -Yes, nice to meet you too. -Get out now! Enjoy yourselves! -Speak to you soon. -Yeah.
