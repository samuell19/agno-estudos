Thank you for the compliment. -Wasn't a compliment. -[Abawi] No? Where I come from, if you're referred to as a bitch means you're doing your job. [General Santiago] Then you should get a promotion. Just stay the fuck out of the way. You've done your part. Now let us do ours. We'll do the right thing at whatever cost. Keep me posted, Colonel Roake. Copy that, sir. I hand-picked you for this program. You get it? Don't drop the ball on me now. Too close to the finish line. I want a status report in 48 hours and a clinical eval on Woodman post hunt. Understood. This man in particular is of special interest to us, Marcus Woodman. You do well for him, there may be a brigadier general spot in our covert ops unit here in Washington. I know the stakes. Good. Carry on. [exhales heavily] Great day. [Hanrahan] Woodman's transport is ten minutes out, sir. I want you to keep an eye on it. [pensive music playing] [Jessica] You're gonna love it. Trust me. Okay.

Yeah, well you better believe them 'cause they're all true. Behavioral avoidance can happen to the best of them. The man spent the last four months at AMACORP's Prime Psych Facility being probed and tested and evaluated. Voodoo bullshit if you ask me. Now, it's up to us to get him back in the saddle... for Ghost. Ghost Recon. Exactly. Never met anyone up for that. And Top, you and I we pull this off, it's gonna be a huge win for both of us. Sir, he's arrived. Would you like him here? -[Roake] That's fine. -[Hanrahan] Sir. [ominous music playing] [gunshot] Damn! I'm good. [laughs] I mean, it was okay. I mean, just five out of five cans okay or was it-- -Easy. -I got it. It's okay. I know, I just-- [exhales] Uh... Anyway, do you wanna go set the cans back up or? Yeah. For you. Oh, no, I'm not really feeling it today. Look, if you don't wanna talk about it, you don't have to, but you can. I don't know. I just, uh... it's like doing good doesn't feel good anymore. Like the right thing became the wrong thing... if that makes any sense. I mean, if it makes sense to you, then that's all that matters. And maybe you could go to that place and you could talk to somebody and maybe they'll understand. [chuckles] Hmm. Either way. I'm here for you. [chuckles] You got this. [birds chirping] [gunshot] The wife? She passed away unfortunately a while after he got out. I think it's why he joined the program. Nothing left for him at home. That's tough stuff right there. [Roake] Yeah, it is. Is he on board? He will be. Once he sees it's not about him, it's about the men and women who will come after him. He is a soldier. He's not just any soldier. The man is an exceptional Navy Seal. This is the fast track back to where he belongs. [tense music playing] [rock music playing in the background] [meat sizzling] -Hey, I'm okay. -Are you sure? [chuckles] Yeah. You go deal with your friends. They're here for you. I'm here for you. Thanks. [party din] Mind if I hang out over here? Mingling is not really my thing. Sure, I'm just flipping these burgers pretending like I know what I'm doing. [laughs] Honestly, I like it. Greg. Marcus, nice to meet you. Like the poet king. -Or the assassin. -Oh, yeah. Depends on how you look at it I guess. That's true. Thanks for not saying that. Saying what? Uh, when people meet me, they usually can't wait to get it out. Thank you for your service. Uh, yeah. You guys don't like that. And I don't blame you. I think living a good life is the best thanks I can give. Exactly. Jess said you're getting out? That's the plan. [sighs] [loud crash] [somber music playing] [siren wailing] [man speaking on police radio] [plastic crinkling] [Claver] Took you long enough. What's that? To get here. Car trouble? I'll drive next time. Shit. Heard about your wife. She's why I'm here. I never picked one up along the way. It's too much to carry. -We ready to go? -You know that mission. Is it true? What's it to you, man? It's just, you know, over 200 kills. You go on a Rambo and shit. And then, of course, you had to put down your own objective. It's too wounded to move so they say. So they say. You know, that's the thing about Lone Survivor missions. It's only ever one version of the story, yours. Ops aren't always clean. Oh, I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty. I can see that. You know, the most dangerous animal in the world, it's a desperate one. Had a mission like yours once, Siberia, three days in the mountains. Snowstorm. Signal was shit. Intel was wrong, like usual. We were hurt, bleeding bad, no ammo. The forest was too thick to land anything in. So we had to climb to elevation. Snow you've never seen in your fucking life. About 15 hours in we start getting tracked by a pack of wolves. Wolves. It doesn't happen like you think. They don't come fast, they wait. They stalk you. They scout ahead. They find the perfect ground to attack. Just like us. My team and I, we took a stand and we waited. Those wolves knew what it was too. 'Cause here comes the biggest motherfucker they got. Gray, this black chest... these big yellow eyes. I knew when I saw that motherfucker a sacrifice would have to be made one way or another. I let him get close. And when he launched I stuck my hand in that motherfuckers mouth and I pulled him close. I was the last thing he ever saw. So I'm still breathing and he's not. -Lucky for you. -You know, they talk like you're some big hero. Well, my team is still alive, your guy isn't. [Abawi] Claver, ready for Woodman. Time to let the dog off the leash. You're wrong. [Claver] How's that? The most dangerous animal, it isn't the desperate one. It's one with nothing to lose. Ready? One, two. [tense music playing] [metallic clattering] [rubber gloves snapping] [dripping] [liquid splashing] [machine whirring] [low tense music playing] [Roake] I'll get him back to you after I debrief him. Top, take care of him. Will you? Copy that sir. Thank you. Chief. I'm Colonel Roake. Good to meet you, son. Come on in. [AMACORP voice] Welcome to the new AMACORP Hunting Program. The ultimate hunting experience for veterans. Your mission, to hunt down all civilians and execute them. [music playing in background] [camera clicks] [laughs] How you doing, son? Fine. Just ready to go. -You packed and strapped? -Of course. Checked it twice like I have been trained to. -Stay alert. -Stay alive. You know, nerves are good. -Keeps you sharp. -I'm not nervous. Hey, Top, you mind if I have a word? Yeah. So, Marcus Woodman? Yeah. To be honest. I've heard some wild ass shit about him. Hmm. I hear ya. But we're the only ones who can relate to this man, right? Like him or not, he's one of ours. He's not one of mine. You kill one of our own, there's no excuse. Not for me. Yeah. [Rachel] Hey. -Hey. -[Lance] Hello. -[Rachel] Hey. -[Lance] Hello. [Rachel] Help. Oh, God. Help. Help me. Help me, please. Please. Please, get me out of here. [chain rattles] Please. Please. Please. [Chris] Why does my head hurt? Please help me out of here. Please. [Lance] I don't fucking know. [Sara] I didn't do anything, please. [Rachel] Just calm down. Just calm down. Shut up, bitch! [Rachel] Please, somebody help. Help! Hey! Somebody! [Lance] Let me out! It was just me and my boyfriend and we were having dinner and then, uh-- Yeah, let-- let's start to-- I-- I was out at the bar. Yo, I don't remember shit. I-- I had just-- I was coming home from work. [Lance] Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! -[Kyle] Keep it down, man. -We're being watched. What? [Rachel] Look, we're being watched. We're being watched. Look there. Look. Look. Somebody, anybody, let me out now. Help us! Hello! Help! [indistinct chatter] [Top] What number hunt is this for you? I don't know. A few dozen. And, um, how has your home life been since treatment? Excellent, honestly. Professionally? Better than ever. So don't you think it would be fair if we give this man the same chances we gave you? Yeah, you're right. I just had to say something. Woodman will mainly be with me and Junior today I'll keep an eye on him. [Price] How's the little dumb dumb doing? He's wound a little tight right now, but that's how it goes. His results will come once he's been in the hot seat. Then we'll see if this is preventative as well. [Sara groaning] The fuck are you? [eerie music playing] What the fuck? Get off me. Hey, hey. Fuck you man. Seriously? Answer me. Hey, hey. [Lance yelling] [Lance] Don't fucking care. [Chris] Help me. [coughing] [Sara groaning] [breathing heavily] [Kyle] Can you just tell me what's going on? [Lance] What's going on? [Kyle] Person to person, please. [Doctor] They are ready. Welcome to the Stalking Fields Program for which you've been selected. I'm sure many of you have questions, but now is not the time. What the fuck? We here, along with the US military, are part of a brand new treatment program. Experimental. And it's working. Okay. The program's trying to bring our best and bravest soldiers back into fight. What are you talking about? I'm talking about serving those who have served you. Giving you an opportunity for a good life, an opportunity that none of you took. The program will start 16 minutes after your release. Here is where I'm sure you will have many questions. I just wanna go home. No, no, no. You have-- you have the wrong people. Okay. I haven't done anything wrong. Please. You see, there are no accidents. Each of you, you're all here for a reason. Rachel, for instance, embezzlement of your own family business a fraud of $3 million. -Hey. -[Abawi] Lance, DUI, aggravated assault, manslaughter. -Wow. -Fuck this and fuck you. [Sara] This is deranged. [Abawi] Sara, another addict whose child is taken from her. I mean, I could go on, shall I? None of you here are special. But you have a chance to be. A chance to reclaim your life, fresh start. Participate and survive, each of you will earn your own identity, $500,000, and passage to anywhere inside the US that you choose. Hey, what the fuck does that mean? What if we say, "Fuck this, fuck you," and don't do shit? [Abawi chuckles] Well, I should tell you that each of you have a nano thermic explosive in your brain. It's a tiny explosive, but remote controlled. What? Should you choose not to participate? Well, I can end your life. It's nothing to me. -[Lance] Holy shit. -God. [Abawi] And finally, I want to express our gratitude for your service. Testing on humans has always had the quickest gains in medical knowledge. And for that, I want to say thank you for making the ultimate sacrifice. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. What? Ultimate sacrifice. What does that mean? [chain rattles] [Abawi] Zimieski, please escort them through the SW tunnel to begin. Oh, and good luck. [Sara sobs] [ominous music playing] Don't fucking think about it. [chains rattling] [Lance groaning] [thudding] [Lance choking] Anybody else? [chokes, coughs] [Zimieski] Get up. Get up against the wall. [Lipson] Hey, shit head. Scoot over, Jesus. You wanna see something? -What is it? -My hunt? No, not really. Why not? You know what? Guess I'm kinda over watching other people get the experience. I hear you. And trust me, I get it. I wish that I would've started off the way you are. Participation first, kill later. Death is a motherfucker. Without the right people, it'll really fuck you up. Yeah, I get it. I'm kind of tired of the excuses. Some people wanna kill. Okay. And what if they don't? Really? No one's ever thought they'd be good at killing and actually been right about themselves? Jesus H-- well, I mean, here's the deal, Princess, you're in a bit of a mood. So I'm gonna help less and I'm gonna kick it over here. But just don't forget I can whoop your fucking ass, all right? Sure, sure, sure. Just know I can handle it. Handle what, boy? Kill, Dad. I'm fucking ready, man. You have me sitting here in the wings. I mean, how are we supposed to know if it's preventative treatment if we don't test it out? I know corporate's on your ass but I'm fucking sick-- I don't care what AMACORP says. You'll go when I say you're ready. [music playing in the background] Don't worry about Woodman. You will go soon. [AMACORP voice] You have made it to the final stage of your treatment. Now go enjoy yourself and have a happy hunt. [Abawi] That's exactly what we do here. Now, you know. No more rumors or whisperings in your command. This is it. Soft combat. It's why there's so much hardware. Your support staff is beyond excellent. While somewhat controversial, these methods have been, well, beyond expectation in terms of results. We get our soldiers back to work, whether it's for the country or for us. That's all well and good but the real question here is... are you willing to do the work necessary to get back out where you belong? Because son, your-- your dossier is-- Excellent. That it is. But it's not just about you, it's about a lot of other men and women like you. The data we retrieve in the field, it dramatically improves our entire process. So if you ever wanna make a difference, here's your chance. -Does it work? -[Abawi] Yes, it does. This is something to be proud of, son. Talked and thought enough the last few months. Let's get on with it. [ominous music playing] You heard the man, let's get on with it. [breathes shakily] [birds chirping] [Zimieski] Protocol is as follows. You'll have exactly 60 minutes to get a head start before your team gets their OP. -Fuck this shit, man. -Fucking serious? Let's do this. -Okay. -Okay. [breaths fast, shakily] How do we survive something like this? Just make it to the river. I'll get you, you piece of shit. -Stop. -I swear. -Stop. Stop. Stop. -You don't even fucking know. -I'll come for you, you fuck. -[Rachel] Please stop. [spits saliva] [gunshots] Please. You-- you don't have to do this. You can just-- you just let us go. You better hurry. [Rachel yelps] [footsteps running] Kill the music. No need. Up, rest. Chief, you can settle in here with your support team. Gentlemen, ladies, you all know the drill. This man is in the final phases of his treatment, which means he needs our help. So, we're gonna do everything within our power to make sure we get him back in the saddle. Is that clear with all of you? [all] Yes, sir. I expect it to be done. -Good luck. -Sir. Welcome. Make yourself at home. We're still a little ways out so you help yourself to anything. Thank you. Welcome, brother. Good to have you. You boys kissing? [chuckles] You'd like that, wouldn't you? I would actually. Um, don't listen to Price. He will never stop talking to you. [Price] Oh, I thought you got off my wit, my charm? Mm. I thought you'd know by now when a woman was faking it. Damn. That's cold. You know I love you Price, like a brother. Like a much younger, slower brother who needs my help just to tie his shoes. Okay. Let the man settle in. Chief Woodman, you can bunk up over there. [music playing in the background] [tense music playing] [Sara] Where are we headed? Straight to the river. [Chris] How much time do we even have? Wait, wait. He gave me a watch. Okay, we'll stop and check. What time you got? 49 minutes left. No, we need to pick it up. [Sara] No, we need to be smart. She's gonna kill us. All right? She's moving slow. She should give me the watch. I have the best chance to get out there. No, we have the best chance if we stick together. Yeah. For the last time I'm not giving you this watch. You think what you want. I'm making it to the river. Look, if you don't have anything good to say then just shut up. What's that? What? That. Oh, my-- [Sara] Careful. [Kyle] Where are its arms and legs? [Rachel] What are you doing? Being of use. I think we should keep moving. Yeah. What the fuck? [Lance groaning] [Chris] Did you find anything? No. [coughs] No, we should, uh, do like she says and keep moving. [coughs] Come on. [breathing heavily] Excuse me. Woodman's looking a little weak. Especially socially. You wanna explain that to me considering he spent so much time at your research facility? He did. But we are talking about a man who is considered to have been one of our deadliest Seals in the last five years. So you okay sending him out there with my men? Of course. Colonel, let's be clear. Nothing we do will ever fully get these men and women back to where they once were. But we can see to it that they're useful again. Useful people is what makes society tick. Thanks for the education. If Woodman doesn't shoot, you do. Yes, ma'am. 43 minutes left. Can we stop for a second? No. It's okay. You just gotta stay positive. -Thanks. -You know. [thudding] [screams] [Sara] Hey, hey! Guys, come quick. [Lance] What the fuck? Give it a minute, man. I thought we cleaned up all the traps. We must have missed one, sir. It's a waste is what it is. Waste of a good resource. [Garcia] It won't happen again, sir. It better not. [indistinct chatter] [Rachel whimpering] [Sara] Be careful guys. [Rachel yelping] [Sara] Oh, my God. What the hell is that? Out here, a wolf trap or something like that? How bad is it? How do you know it's a wolf trap? Slowly. What? You've never seen a wolf trap before? We don't have time for this, we gotta go. Fuck you, Lance. No seriously. Fuck you. -How do I get this thing off? -Usually, that is uncinched. -Let me try. -[Rachel screams, crying] -Please. It hurts. -God, it's not moving. Stop whining. Either I'm not strong enough or it's stuck. Fine. Fine. I'll fucking help if it gets her out quicker. Hey. You got it. All right, you ready? [crying] One, two, three. -Pull. -[Rachel screaming] [Chris] It's not moving. [Lance] Pull harder motherfucker. [Rachel crying in pain] [Chris] It's not. [Lance] Fuck! [Chris] Uh, maybe we can cut it with something. -Yeah. -With what? Uh, let's see. Uh. The chain goes all the way around the log there's no way we're gonna move it. Or we could break it with something somehow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, a rock or anything sharp. -[Lance] Oh, my God. -Here, here, here. [Sara] Oh, okay, okay, here. [thumping] The shit's not working. Time? [Kyle] I don't know, she has the watch. [breathing heavily] Can we have it? Just in case? [Rachel] Wait. [all breathing heavily] Okay. Thirty-eight minutes. Which just means we gotta be faster. No, it means we're literally running out of time. We can't sit here and play MacGyver forever. Seriously, what is wrong with you? Look, we've got about an hour. We can still do this. I would want you to do the same if it were me. I'm just being realistic. Oh, really? So you'd want us to just leave you here for dead? Abso-fucking-lutely. You are a real piece of work, man. I'm not dying for some stranger. I-- I'm sorry. Oh, but you can kill one with your car? Fucking know what you're talking about. [Sara] Stop! -You don't fucking know. -Stop. It's not helping at all. Okay? Hey, hey, hey. What's that? Look, put pressure right here. [Lance] Quit the shit. A hunting vehicle. [Chris] This shit is not gonna run. -[Lance] Glove box. -Right? Maybe there's something we can use. [alarm beeping] Woodman takes out the band, it's with our support and support only. Stay loose and have some fun. All right? Let's have a go. [birds chirping] [car door creaking] Fuck. Fuck. Where's the fucking gun? I found something. [car honks] -Jesus. -Fuck! Sorry. [somber music playing] This is stupid, but-- What? I didn't do anything that I wanted to do. [Sara] What do you mean? I just-- I was just too stupid. I don't know, I was selfish. -Please don't talk like that. -I'm gonna die here-- Don't talk like that. I'm so sorry. I did it all wrong. Don't be sorry. Okay. Don't. Don't. -I did it all wrong. -I promise you that we are gonna get you out of here. It's okay. I'm sorry. Please, no. Stay awake. Stay awake. Rachel, just breathe. Okay. Just breathe. We're gonna get outta here. We're gonna get outta here. Yeah. Hey, this looks like the area we're in right now. -Right? -Wait. Hold-- hold on. We don't even know if that shit is real. What are you talking about? Well, the map. I mean, it's a perfect fucking map placed here for us. -We don't know. -Come on. You can't be serious. I mean, look at this thing. Looks like hasn't been touched in forever. They probably forgot about it. And who gives a fuck? It's the only thing we got. Feels like you're working against us, it's crazy. Who me? You fuck face! I'm trying to be smart. Who knows what they set up for us? Holy shit. Hey, hey. Guys. Holy shit. This could be the river. And this looks like a clearing not too far from here, right? Between us and the river. Yeah. Yeah. I-- I say-- I say we go there and try and find something to help us get the hell outta here. Guys, she passed out. -[breaths shakily] -Shit. It's not good, guys. [gunshot in a distance] [gun powder crackling] What-- what is that? Kyle, what-- what time do you have? 30 minutes. It might be a warning or something. Yeah, unless that lead was bullshitting and they're coming right now. Either way, we probably shouldn't stay in one spot too long. What about helping Rachel? [exhaling] [door bursting out] [door creaking] Eagle one, this is Red Dog one. Do you copy? [Roake] Red Dog, this is Eagle. We got you loud. Be advised that designated call signs are in effect. Copy Eagle one. Red Dog, two, three, four, five, this is Red Dog one, mic check. Three here. Four here. -Five here. -Copy that. Eagle one, Red Dog one, two and five will branch off to the southwest and head down to the clearing, break. Red Dog three and four will team up and head southbound to flank them as we flush them out. Red Dog one out. [Roake] Great. Copy. [tense music playing] We already did this. All right? We obviously have to leave her. We can't. If it weren't for that map and watch, I wouldn't be standing here. Her leg is fucked even if she wakes up. [Sara] No, no, no, no. Okay. Just wait. -[Lance] For what? -I can get her up. Okay? Come on, Rachel. Wake up. Guys, I hate to say but we have to go. -[Sara] No. -[Chris] Now! Time? 23 minutes. Hey, hey, hey, hey. You wanna live, right? -Right? -Yes. This is something we have to do. There is no choice here. -Okay, fine. -Thank you. Thank you. [footsteps rustling] [tense music intensifies] [camera beeping] [rustling] Oh, my God. The map is real. You know, I don't see anybody. I can go down there. Yeah, why don't-- why don't you give me the map? I'll check out over here. No, fuck that. We'll never see you again. Are you sure? Yeah. I can go down there and I'll-- I'll scope it out and I'll wave you guys down. All right, you better hurry 'cause we only got 13 minutes left. [tense music continues] [footsteps] What's your deal? You're not your usual jackass self today. -What do you mean? -You know what I mean. I heard you talking to Rawlings. You know that mission at the ISO prison with the CIA dude? The one where one of ours killed over 200 of theirs? Yeah, of course. Well. Woodman? -Oh. -Yeah. -[panting] -Okay. All right, I say we look for anything we can use to defend ourselves. I bet we could find something that would -cut that chain on Rachel. -No, she's dead, Sara! She's dead! And we are too if we go back. Yeah. We-- weapons. Yeah. Okay. Uh, uh, I'll check that big stuff over there. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Let's split up. I'll go with you. Fine. We'll look over here. ♪ [Lance] Check around the corner. [Lipson] That's one of the most savage things I've ever heard of. -I know. -[sharp exhales] So, you afraid that there's gonna be a bigger swinging dick around here? -Ha-ha. -Mm-hmm. My dick is just perfectly average, so fuck you. [Lipson] I'm just saying. [Price] Well, I'm saying there's some pretty fucked up details said about that mission. -[Lipson] So? -[Price] So? Stupid, my point being that he wasn't actually too wounded to be moved. That woman executed him. See, that doesn't make any fucking sense, because why would you go through all of that effort just to kill the guy? That's what I'm saying. What if you weren't through all that just to kill him? [Chris screams in the distance] [Chris] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I had to. I had to. I had to. I had to. [Price] Even if it was for a good reason, kill your own guy like that, it had to fuck you up.
