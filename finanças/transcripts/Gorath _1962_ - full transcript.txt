Only the moon is watching. Hey! Alright, then I'll join you! We have a news flash for you. We have a news flash for you. At 20:00, the first Saturn expedition spacecraft, JX-1 Hayabusa, successfully took off from Mount Fuji Foot Spaceport. The crew consists of its captain, Dr. Raizou Sonoda... deputy captain and engineer Hideo Manabe... and 37 other members. It's your father! Dad, do your best! You should say something too! Huh? To Mr. Manabe. To Mr. Manabe? Say "Let's get married when you get back!" Come on! This is the observation team at Mount Fuji Foot Spaceport. Trajectory: 23.3 degrees to the equator. Second cosmic velocity, 11.2 km/s. No abnormalities. Hayabusa, we wish you all the best for the Saturn expedition. Over. Escaping from Earth's gravitational sphere. Main engine, stop. Inertia navigation. Main engine, stopping. Inertia navigation. EARTH DEPARTURE: 20:00hrs, 29TH SEPTEMBER 1976 MARS ORBIT REACH ESTIMATE: 11:08hrs, 3RD OCTOBER JUPITER ORBIT REACH ESTIMATE: 01:33hrs, 9TH OCTOBER SATURN ORBIT REACH ESTIMATE: 14:15hrs, 10TH OCTOBER Preparing to observe. We've passed the orbit of Mars. No abnormalities with navigation. This is Earth's Solar System 1st Broadcasting. To all spacecrafts currently cruising... The Palomar Observatory has announced September 30th, 18:20... that at approximately 36 degrees bearing from Pluto... a black dwarf about 6,000 times of Earth's mass was discovered. It has been named Gorath. 6,000 times of Earth's! Severe impacts are expected on all planets in the Solar System along its path. The Space Traffic Control Committee has considered it a serious situation, and has called out to all spacecrafts cruising in the same area... to immediately aid in the observation. What should we do? We're the closest to it. Right auxiliary engine, prepare to start! Right auxiliary engine, preparing to start! Direction: Left 10.30 degrees. Direction: Left 10.30 degrees! Fire it up! No errors in Saturn position correction. Orbit of Saturn passed. Hey. Are we putting the Saturn expedition aside? Yes. Listen. This ship will now undertake its new mission of investigating Gorath. Over. Captain. Isn't it great that we're the closest to Gorath? We'll be the first humans to see Gorath! We'll be like Columbus and Gagarin! Carina's comet, no abnormalities. Captain, we can't calculate it. What? Don't tell me we missed it? You must be kidding. It's 6,000 times of Earth's mass. There's no way we missed it. Correspondent. Contact the UN Space Station. Obtain Gorath's observation data again. I'll obtain Gorath's observation data. Captain, we're under the influence of gravity from an unknown source! Direction? Right ascension: 176 degrees. Declination: -13.5 degrees. Speed: 0.47 g. Main engine, stop! Reverse rockets, prepare to start! Main engine, stopping! Reverse rockets, preparing to start! Reverse rockets, start! Reverse rockets, starting! Captain! This is the one. Reverse rockets, stop! 180 degrees right, full throttle! Main engine, start! Main engine, starting! Captain, we finally caught it. We might be the ones who are caught. Acceleration: 1.60 g. Auxiliary engines, full throttle! Captain, we don't have fuel to spare. We went much further than our planned route to reach here! Its gravitational pull is 6,000 times of Earth's! Hold on. Is Gorath's radius really this little? Yeah, we've calculated over and over again. But it's 6,000 times the mass of Earth! Go complain to the computer. Manabe. Yes? A spacecraft of unknown nationality is plunging into Gorath! Captain. Is there any hope of escape? What are we going to do if we run short on fuel? At this rate, we'll... Back to your stations! So what if we're unable to escape? Are we going to go out drinking wine and singing songs? The observation from Earth was erroneous. Right now, we're the only ones who can determine the true identity of this star that's throwing the Solar System into disorder. We'll observe it to the end... and report the results! To the UN Space Station and the Earth Radio Waves Control Tower... This is the Japanese spacecraft, JX-1 Hayabusa. We are transmitting our last Gorath observation data. Acceleration: 3.57 g. Captain! Everyone. Listen. Our spacecraft, Hayabusa, has completed its mission. We can no longer escape from the ominous star Gorath. But the precious data we have transmitted will surely receive the gratitude of humanity back on Earth. Everyone. You have done a good job coming this far. Thank you. Long live the Earth! Long live the Earth! Long live the Earth! How about we call the police? I'm serious! Oh, Mr. Kanai. Don't be too disgraceful. The 1980s are a period of space development. What do you think? The shares for the Saturn Development Company is a hot commodity right now. Did you get fired from the Ministry of Space? Just earning extra money during the New Year while I'm on my end-of-year break. I thought you were making a killing as an astronaut. One can never have too much money. Oops, danger is approaching. Bye-bye! What's with him? He's making fun of us. Mr. Kanai is still the same as ever. He stopped growing in high school. But he managed to become a pilot for the Ministry of Space, right? "I was 1 out of 800 people," he said. It's not like we're still in the era when artificial satellites were first launched. He's only a driver. He's a palanquin bearer in the Tokugawa era. Rather than his brains, they sought the strength of his heart. Merry Christmas! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way~ Merry Christmas! Excuse me. Hey, wait. Hey, you're the captain's daughter, right? Are you Ms. Tomoko? What happened? Have you not learned about it yet? She doesn't know it yet? Miss! Miss! Cheer up. Dad did what he could. HAYABUSA DISASTER The Diet has begun investigations into the cause of the accident... but depending on the opposition's response, the Seki cabinet will be held accountable. I'm firmly against it. I'm not sure about honoring Captain Sonoda as a hero either. This recklessness took place in space. It's a star 6,000 times of Earth, right? I can't believe they failed to spot it before colliding into it. It has to be the captain's fault. It's the mass that's 6,000 times. It isn't even three quarters the size of Earth. Oh? It's even smaller than Earth... but is 6,000 times heavier? Well, let's wait for the investigation committee to determine the cause of the accident. But that aside... Hayabusa was launched for the Saturn expedition in the first place. When did they change their objective, and who gave the directive? Did the Ministry of Space do so? There was no directive. There was no directive from the Ministry of Space. This a problem. Well, Mr. Kinami... At that time, astronomers around the world were making a big fuss over it. The Solar System Broadcast was fervently asking for aid in the Gorath observation too. That doesn't excuse the captain from making his own decision. Hayabusa is funded by the Japanese government. There were big hopes for the Saturn expedition. Our citizens must be greatly disappointed too. The people won't stay silent on this. Prime Minister, if we handle this poorly, heads will roll in the cabinet. Dr. Kouno from the Astrophysics Society has arrived. Hello. Thank you for being here despite your busy schedule. Please, have a seat. Please. We've finally finished the report. Let me start with the conclusion. If Gorath continues on its path, it will collide with Earth. Are you certain about that? Academic societies in America and the Soviet Union have made the same conclusion. We've received telegrams from scientific societies all over the world, thanking us for the precious data from Hayabusa. So we have a favor to ask. We want to adhere to the UN Science Committee decisions and move forward with the plan. It's not a problem Japan can handle on its own. Gorath, or in other words, a sun in its old age... still burns at over a thousand degrees celcius of heat on its surface. The Astrophysics Society of Japan has requested the UN Science Committee to hold an emergency meeting. MOUNT FUJI FOOT SPACEPORT Dr. Kouno and Dr. Tazawa aren't here. That can't be. We checked with the Ministry of Space already. They are supposed to be here this afternoon. ANTI-GRAVITY ROOM Alright! What? Hey! Hey! What are you doing?! Training isn't a game! P is a little big. Hey! Hey! Hey! That brat! I'll go get him back. Hey! You too! Leave it to me! Hey! What happened? The captain is back! Huh? It's the captain! The captain is back! Let's go! Alright! Let's go! Good work. Thanks. Captain! Captain! How did it go? Damn it... Unfortunately, Ootori's departure has been canceled. What?! No way! Hey, lend me your ears, everyone. Hm? Alright! Good plan. Let's go! Get in! Alright. Counting on you! Yeah. I have no regrets leaving this tiny Earth~ In the unknown world, dreams are aplenty, aplenty~ The vast universe is mine, mine~ Let's soar to the end of the skies~ It's my massive wish, my aspiration~ I am~ I am~ I am a space pilot! The cloudless skies are our hearts~ Even today, we continue to load our hopes, load our hopes~ The vast universe is mine, mine~ It's time to show my courage as a man~ Open up a new world of freedom~ I am~ I am~ I am a space pilot! Let's go! Alright! Hayabusa's accident warned Earth about an impending crisis. It was truly a noble sacrifice... It's okay, I'll go. What's the matter? We're crew members of Ootori, the spacecraft that was supposed to depart to observe Gorath. Director, please tell us the reason for the launch's cancellation. If you need to talk, talk with your captain. Because of the cancellation, the captain took out a pistol and fired at his head. Is he dead? We jumped at him, and he only blew off his right ear as a result. You guys again! Captain Endou lost his right ear five years ago. Umm, Director. Shut up! Come in. Sit. Okay. Hey, Director. It was our seniors who first discovered Gorath and sent back the precious data to warn Earth of the crisis. So isn't it our duty to continue observing it to get a more complete picture of the situation? Canceling the launch after approving it... That's like failing at the last hurdle. Oh? Who said it was canceled? I haven't heard about it. But our captain... Endou just couldn't immediately get the budget he was hoping for. You guys are blowing it up too much. In order to get the budget, the Diet has to approve it. It's no tiny sum of money. Do you guys know how much the launch of Hayabusa cost? 11.8 trillion... If we laid 10,000 yen bills side by side, they would wrap around the Earth five and a half times, with some change to spare. Exactly. And all that money came to nothing. I'm in a tough position too. But that doesn't mean I gave up. I was just about to make a request for a special budget. You must be tired. No, I can't say that. After all, we made you take the trouble to come. As long as I can help, I'm always happy to be of service. Although it's indeed tiring to repeatedly visit the government offices. Come on. By the way, driver... What will you all do if Gorath comes? Gorath? Ah, that shooting star? It's nothing, sir. There have been so many stories about collisions with stars. Yet we haven't collided with a single one yet. But the news and radio... Making a fuss about things is their job. Scholars all over the world are worried. That's just according to the scholars' theories. But will there really be a collision? It won't go according to their theories. I'll be in trouble if I talk more. As was written in Tsurezuregusa (Essays in Idleness)... "Gathered as the ants did, and they hurried from the east to the west and from the south to the north." In every era, human beings are only pressured by what's in front of them. It's Mr. Kouno. Hey. In great demand as usual, I see. I was just showing my face around when Tazawa brought me along... but the Ministry of Space treated me nicely today too. When I was on the way back in the car, I suddenly felt the urge to see you, so I dropped by. Welcome. Ah, we have Mr. Kouno here tonight. Perhaps we should have whisky. Yes, thank you. Is it okay? Sorry, I have to turn it down. I have a conference soon. Why not? We don't have much, but I already prepared the meal. It's not like you have time to eat somewhere anyway, right? Yeah. You have to take care of yourself a little more. That's right. It's not like Gorath is colliding right now, right? Well, that's true. In that case, I'll accept your kind offer. Me too. No. Just a little! What are you saying? The Earth is going to be destroyed in 750 days. I want to experience being drunk once. Don't be stupid. That's exactly why we're troubling Kouno and Tazawa to prevent the collision. So how are we going to save the Earth? There's no clear plan yet. By the UN Science Committee, right? If we're going to start a lecture the day after tomorrow, then honestly, Japan's scientific societies are an embarrassment. And the government won't send out Ootori. Well, the government and citizens don't feel like it's their problem. I bet they think this should be left to America or the Soviet Union. Even I feel like I'm relying on you all. Can't we blow it up with hydrogen bombs? Hmm, bombs, eh? It will be difficult. Then Earth has to run away. How will it run away? For example... we install a massive rocket somewhere and make it fly away like a spacecraft. Nonsense. We can't possibly do that. But our only two options are to either blow up Gorath or have Earth run away. If it were that simple, we wouldn't be in such a bind. Enough of that. Here. Okay. Here you go. Doctor. Hayao is right. If there's no other way, then we may have to seriously consider those two options. We have to either change the course of Gorath, or Earth has to flee. These are the only two options to save humanity. To this day, it is said that human science was developed through war. But it's also an undeniable fact that many human lives have been sacrificed for that purpose. However, it's time we used science not for destruction... but solely for saving all of humanity. The Science Committee must overcome all obstacles... and strive our hardest to accomplish this objective. If Gorath enters the Solar System, it will reach Earth in 45 days. Before that happens, Earth has to be moved at least 400,000 km. We'll require 66,000,000,000 megatons of thrust for that. So the acceleration will be 1.10 x 10⁻⁶ g. Theoretically, it is possible to move the Earth. But where do we get the energy for it? Atomic energy, of course. But do we have that amount of fissionable substance available at the present time? We do. Heavy hydrogen and hydrogen-3. If we utilize seawater, we'll have an inexhaustible supply of energy. Isn't that H-bomb energy? What about the problem of radioactivity? There is no need to worry about that. Even in Japan, considering our research progress, I'm confident we'll succeed. Isn't this still in the stages of research? Gentlemen, why are we gathered here? It is to save the Earth and mankind! It is time the nations dropped all egotism and join hands! Dr. König. You've done fine work on your research on high-voltage discharge vibrators for ionized hydrogen. It would be invitable now. Dr. Huberman. It is your country that built a heavy hydrogen atomic energy power plant! I think we should have no secrets! Let's get this done. You are right. My respects to the Japanese representative who's pointed out that heavy hydrogen atomic energy is available. On behalf of the United Nations Science Committee, let us request our countries... to release their data for the South Pole Operation. They're building a massive rocket base at the South Pole. They're moving the Earth. In other words, they're changing the orbit of Earth. Hold on. What do you think of the plan to blow up Gorath instead? Yeah, the military is excited for it. I convinced them to wait until we've gathered more detailed observation data. I see. Sorry. When are you leaving for Japan? No, I'm not going back. Huh? Tazawa should be going. Ah, Mr. Tazawa! Mr. Tazawa! If it comes 200,000 km close, there will be changes in Earth's crust. There will be earthquakes, landslides, and volcanic activities. Even extinct volcanoes like Mount Fuji will erupt. Water and even air will be sucked up by Gorath's gravitational pull. This is the seabed of the Pacific Ocean. The mountains we see behind is the Japanese archipelago. These are not clouds. Part of the objects sucked up from Earth... will float in space for eternity like artificial satellites. These slides were responsibly created by the UN Science Committee based on accurate data. Of course, a direct collision would spell the end of Earth. But if Gorath continues on its current trajectory... then even in a best-case scenario, this will happen. Honestly speaking, we aren't qualified to make a statement. In that case, we politicians have to offer our seats to the scientists. Prime Minister. We have a telegram from UN headquarters requesting the launch of Ootori for the investigation of Gorath. Okay. I have no regrets leaving this tiny Earth~ In the unknown world, dreams are aplenty, aplenty~ The vast universe is mine, mine~ Let's soar to the end of the skies~ Ow! It's my massive wish, my aspiration~ I am~ I am~ I am a space pilot! Hey, everyone, let's toast! Let's toast! Yeah! A drink! Hey, join in. Hey. Ah, thanks. 700 days before Gorath arrives. We may end up getting smashed to bits by Gorath while you guys survive somewhere in space. Let's have a toast! A toast! A toast! Let's have a toast! Okay. Over there too. Hey. Here. Oh, Captain. Emergency call-up. Huh? Our departure timing has changed. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... One of you is missing. Where's Kanai? TAKIKO NOMURA This is Astronaut Tatsumaro Kanai! Do you know people say you stopped growing in high school? Thank you. You're beautiful! What are you saying? Come in quick. Stop screwing around. This is an apartment. Don't be so mad. I brought a present for you. A present? Don't be too weird. Isn't this the real thing? Yeah. I thought I should bring it anyway. It might be my first and last present. How did you get your hands on this? Don't say it like that. Because I can't believe you can afford something like this. I got my salary, but I don't have time to use it. We're setting off tomorrow. It's goodbye to Earth for now. Ootori is departing? Yeah, for the Gorath observation. Oh... Asking me to leave already? Let's call Ms. Tomoko and hold a farewell party. I don't have time for that, and I don't want to either. It's the same for us astronauts and those guys going to the South Pole. There's no guarantee we'll succeed. So that means we might not meet again. Take this back. You know about Mr. Manabe and me, right? But he's dead. I still haven't accepted it yet. What's the matter? That's terrible of you! You stopped growing in high school too! Mr. Kanai! Hey. We're saying goodbye to Earth and the moon for now. That's where humans live. Yeah. My dad and mom too. And that girl. 30 minutes before we pass the first station. What should we do? It's not like there's anyone to refuel us. Shall we fly? It's about France, Portugal, and the Czech Republic's feelings. I'd go greet them, but it'd take 2 to 3 hours. Alright, let's go nonstop. How promising. Every country has mobilized their space stations. We needed these when Gorath was discovered. Then Hayabusa would have been saved. We can't say that. Even when we say it's for the sake of humanity, the UN is still made up of white people, black people, and Asians. It takes time and effort to discard our honor and greed to work together. This way, please. This is a model of the main center. This has a diameter of 100 meters. This is the main area. Peter. Look at that. Yes. OK. Please. Okay, we'll try that. You've accel 1.3, yes? Yours working alright? Yes, I think it'll work. How's your plan? It's working very well. We will increase this area by 1 meter. And I think that will solve our problem satisfactorily. Good. So we just gonna have to make this change. OK, we'll put this in here. So it fits in with this unit. That's right. Right? Don't you agree? I believe so. I think so. We'll put this in here. It ought to work just fine. Right. The pipe is 500 meters tall above ground. Why's the rocket so fat? Wouldn't the propulsion be stronger if we add more of them? A rocket's thrust doesn't depend on making it lighter, but depends on the area of the propulsion opening. So we can't add more. Oh? If we need to move Earth by at least 400,000 km in 100 days... we'll need a total of 600 km² of propulsion openings... and this will require 66,000,000,000 megatons of energy. My... Hey, why do you think they chose the South Pole for this instead of the North Pole? Isn't that obvious? The South Pole is a continent, but it's just the ocean at the North Pole. Right? Sanada! Good work. How was it at the committee? Did our request get approved? I guess. Countries around the world are contributing a great amount of material. It directly affects their citizens lives and defense plans. That's what they said. If Earth collides with Gorath, defense plans will be gone in a flash, after all. Is the construction going according to schedule? Yeah... The problem we're facing is the underground construction area around Pipe 33. We hit solid rock almost immediately. Watch out! Run for it! Evacuate! Evacuate! Hey, what's going on?! We're having trouble. Where? Show us. Down this way. Keep going. Run fast! Faster! Faster! I wonder if the excavation works caused the soil to cave in. Anyway, we can't use here. If we change the location, we'll have to start all over again. Yeah. Well, it can't be helped. Will we make it in time? We have to account for at least 60 days lost. Gorath won't wait for us. Sanada. Have we received data from Ootori yet? They're almost in range for the investigation. All personnel to emergency stations! Prepare capsule launch! Hey, get to your station! Hey, you're being slow. Hurry up. I am a space pilot! Ow! Reverse rockets, start! Reverse rockets, starting+! No directional adjustment! Hey. Hurry up. Captain. Gorath's gravitational pull is greatly different than what's recorded. How much? About 6,200 times of Earth's! Are you sure that's right? There's no mistake. Captain. Or Gorath has gotten larger since it was last observed by Hayabusa. Even so, it went from 6,000 times to 6,200 times... It's unimaginable that it's grown by another 200 Earths. But Captain, when Palomar Observatory first announced it, it was 6,000 times. Hayabusa reported it was 6,100 times. At first glance, it seems like one of them is wrong... but actually, both of them were right! Right, Captain? Gorath might be increasing in size by absorbing other celestial bodies! Capsule launch platform, preparations finished. Kanai to board. Yes, Kanai getting into the capsule. 5 minutes to launch. Kanai. Gorath's gravity is continuously increasing. There's a possibility that it might suddenly increase further. Look sharp or you'll end up like Hayabusa. Roger! Not just roger! Don't take your eyes off the gravity meter! If things look dangerous, get back immediately. Roger! Not just roger! That capsule is vital for the plan to blow up Gorath. Even if we get the data... it'll be all for nothing if you don't return. Captain, I value my own life too. Roger! Maintenance officers, withdraw! Maintenance officers, withdrawing. Extend capsule launch platform! Launching! 10 seconds! 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... 0! This is the captain of JX-2. Capsule 1 isn't able to get close enough. Remember to keep a safe distance! Capsule 1! Capsule 1! Capsule 1! Capsule 1! Kanai! Pull the lever! The capsule managed to successfully escape. Prepare capsule retrieval. Preparing capsule retrieval. So its mass is 6,200 times of Earth's? How do we blow up such a thing? Compile the data recorded by the capsule and send it to the base at once. Gorath cannot be destroyed. Yes. Captain. Kanai is acting strange. What happened? I don't know. Kanai! Look at me! Do you recognize me? It's me, Itou! Who is this? Isn't this photo precious to you? Your girlfriend! You can't remember? Hey! Enough. You be quiet please. Hey, Kanai! Kanai! Have you forgotten who I am?! Kanai! Kanai! Hey, stop it. What's wrong, Kanai? Kanai... Kanai... Who... are you? He's completely lost his memory. 120 seconds! Ootori has reported that it's impossible to change the course of Gorath. The fate of the Earth depends on what we do now. The countdown has begun. As 66,000,000,000 megatons thrust of jet pipes fire up simultaneously with columns of flames... will Earth start to move? And what about the acceleration? 60 seconds! The moment that Earth's fate depends on, that humanity's hope clings onto closes in. The people of the world, researchers dispatched to the moon and Mars... and crew members of the spacecraft returning from the Gorath observation... listen to the ticking of the clock as they pray for success. 20 seconds! Heavy hydrogen, no abnormalities with cooling. Heavy hydrogen, begin generation! Observation platform, no abnormalities. Prepare to fire! 10 seconds! 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... 0! Fire! This is the observation HQ outside the gravitational sphere. It's a success. Earth has started moving with an acceleration of 1.10 x 10⁻⁶ g. A success! It's a great success! The first stage of the South Pole operation is a success! Humanity is moving the Earth with their own will and power! It's moving! It's moving! Thank goodness! You have a call from Tokyo. It's your beautiful wife. Doctor, please. What? It's you. Why not? Congratulations. Anyway, Tokyo is all fired up too. I'm going to school to celebrate tonight. I see. Good work. Hold on. Congratulations on succeeding. Thank you. Really, congratulations. Thank you. See? Big Sis just can't speak without choking with emotions anyway. Shut up. Go away. Oh. Earth is moving as scheduled. A fairly auspicious start to the new year. No, the real battle starts here. It isn't time to say our heartfelt congratulations yet. Dr. Tazawa is here. Oh. Hey. When were you back from the South Pole? This morning. I flew to New York, but they said you were in Tokyo. That must have been great trouble. Are those guys at the South Pole still grumbling away? Anyway, Doctor, the UN has come to a clear conclusion... that there's no need to expand the base. Gorath's mass got bigger unexpectedly. If it gets any bigger, Earth won't be able to escape anymore. Well... It's okay. There's no numerical basis for that. Are you saying there's a numerical basis that it's okay? If something does happen, the UN will take responsibility for it. What's the point of taking responsibility if something does happen? Humanity might be wiped out! You shouldn't speak like that to Dr. Kouno. No, let me say this. Just this time, you need to listen to my opinion. Please. I should be the one saying that. Have I ever disagreed with you before? Calm down. For now, take him there to rest. Yes. Let's do that. You're a little tired. Yeah. And? That's not nice, eavesdropping like that. I'm part of humanity too, you know. I have the right to listen. Tazawa is right. If Gorath gets any bigger, the water and atmosphere will be sucked up by it. Well, even if that doesn't happen, it's very likely that water will gather at the North and South Poles. So why didn't you join Tazawa and the others in convincing the UN? As a scientist, shouldn't you be preparing for the worst and doing your best? As a matter of fact, it's not something I can do at the UN either. They know the youngsters are right, but they have to suppress their voices. Just thinking about it makes me mad. So you've done everything that's humanly possible? Does that mean there's nothing left to do but pray? I'm afraid the unlikely might happen. If part of the machines malfunction... humanity might perish. When I think of that as a scientist... No. You're crying, Doctor? There's nothing more anyone can do. Even if Earth is destroyed... even if humanity perishes... I'll be thankful to all of you scientists. The people of the world too. Thank you. To all space stations and spacecrafts... This is Earth's United Nations Gorath Countermeasure Committee with Directive 205. Please return to your respective spaceports. Gorath has passed the orbit of Pluto and entered the Solar System... and will arrive at Earth in 45 days. Over. Let's go. Yeah. See you. All in order. Yes. 45 days left. There must be no malfunctions. An earthquake! Who's there?! Who's there?! Hey! Big trouble! There's been an incident at the South Pole base! What?! According to emergency news! You have a call from Dr. Kouno. Wasn't he in New York? It's an international call. I see. Hello? Thanks for waiting. Can you fly to the South Pole right away? South Pole? It's not that far. It's on Earth. I'm going too. What are you saying out of the blue? We'll talk about it there, okay? Hey, wait! Wait! Hey, wait! This is unmistakably reptile blood. What a surprise to find such a creature still living underground in the South Pole. Well, we even changed Earth's orbit. There's no telling what anomalies may occur among animals and plants. Dr. Tazawa, this is the propulsion center. Restoration works complete. Igniting at once. Alright. That's right... The South Pole is warm now. Is there a lake nearby? It would be a pity to kill it. I wish we can at least bring back a specimen. Doctor, thanks to it, we wasted 72 hours. If we get attacked again, the Earth is finished. Get ready to fire! Readying to fire! Fire! Firing! Let's go down and take a look? Alright, descend. Descending! There! It looks like it's dead. Hm? It's still alive. Let's attack it again. Yes. Watch out! Run quick! Fire! Firing! Captain, Gorath is approaching Saturn. Gorath has crossed the orbit of Saturn and is getting closer and closer to Earth. If it continues on its course, when Gorath is at its closest distance to Earth... seawater will be attracted to the North and South Poles. Ms. Takiko. Due to strong winds, there will be storm surges in coastal areas. Regions 100 meters below sea level will likely be completely submerged in water. Landslides are expected in some mountainous areas. Ms. Takiko. Ms. Takiko. The Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters advises everyone to evacuate to designated safe areas... at least 12 hours before Gorath's closest approach. What's wrong? Why the blank face? Come on. In this case, it's the same no matter where we run. We'll die when we die. What are you saying? Maybe we'd be happier better if Gorath hit Earth and everyone died. Don't be stupid. Oh, Mr. Kanai! When did you return? He lost his memory. What? Just come in. Okay. Come. Actually, he was carrying a photo of you everywhere he went. Mr. Kanai. Sorry. He doesn't remember at all. That's right... Doesn't he have a big sister in Shibuya? Has he met her? We tried that, but she had already evacuated. It's unfortunate, but we may have to bring him to the hospital. Mr. Kanai, you really don't recognize me? Look, it's Ms. Takiko. Don't you recognize her? Hey. Please stop. These questions hurt him the most. Let's leave. Please wait. Let's evacuate together. Huh? He was with you since kindergarten. I'm sure you'll be of help. Yeah. I see. In that case, please take care of him. Yeah. Hey. Have a good recovery, okay? Please evacuate before the given time. This is a special broadcast by the Gorath Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters. Tonight, Gorath continues to be visible like a full moon in the Tokyo skies. No effects will be felt while it is still visible from the northern hemisphere... but when it disappears from view from the northern hemisphere, seawater will start shifting as it makes its closest approach to Earth. Just as we feared, we're unable to recover 46 hours of miscalculation. This is the ocean current observation team. At the present time of 23:00, water safety level has been breached by 10 meters. Sound the emergency alarm. This is the South Pole Propulsion Main Center. The emergency warning has sounded at Tokyo time 23:00. Please do not turn off your radio or TV. Please do not turn off your radio or TV. Please evacuate! Please evacuate! Propulsion speed? 93 meters per second. Everything under control. Alright. The movement of seawater has begun to bring about storm surges. This is expected to continue for a considerable length of time in the Central Pacific, Sea of Japan, and China Sea. Hayao, don't walk around! Stay here! It's okay! It's a landslide! We bring you the latest situation from the South Pole again. Mr. Kanai! No! No! Due to the appearance of the monster, Magma, 72 hours were lost. Mr. Kanai! 36% of the loss was recovered, which cut down the loss to 46 hours. Quiet! Lie him down quietly. Bring water! Hurry up with the water! But how will the propulsion fare in the end? Hang on! Mr. Kanai! This is the South Pole Headquarters. Mr. Kanai! The jet pipes are getting overwhelmed with the rapidly encroaching seawater. Hank, check the computer, will you? Yes, right away. 2 minutes to go. The final moment draws near. Just 2 minutes! Gorath will be at its closest distance to Earth in 2 minutes! Mr. Kanai! Mr. Kanai! Mr. Kanai! Mr. Kanai! Mr. Kanai! Mr. Kanai! He's awake! It's you? You recognize me? What happened to Ootori? What happened to Gorath? Earth is already moving. We did it? We did it! Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! Long live the Earth! The entire world celebrates. The South Pole Operation was a complete success! The Earth has just escaped a crisis! Our science... Humanity's science has saved the Earth! The ominous star Gorath is now moving away from Earth! Long live the Earth! It's over! Oh! Long live the Earth! Firing fireworks! Long live the Earth! One! Tomoko. We have to make a call to Mr. Tazawa at the South Pole at once. Yes. No. 1 to No. 15, prepare to put out fires. Now we face our biggest challenge. We must put the Earth back on her original course. Otherwise, we can't tell what might happen next. But it's going to be more troublesome to set up propulsion facilities at the North Pole than the South Pole. It's the middle of the ocean. But we must do it. Yes, we must. As the light of peace returns in the skies of Tokyo... the nightmarish storm surge recede, and the submerged Kanto Plain begins to reemerge. Whoa, Tokyo is completely destroyed! We can just create a new Tokyo. You make it sound so simple. Yeah. Just now at the South Pole, Mr. Tazawa said this, right? "As long as humanity survives, there will be infinite possibilities." We'll create a new Tokyo with proper city planning. This is a message from the UN Science Committee. "Everyone, we won." The ominous star Gorath is already leaving the Solar System. Let's forever cherish this victory humanity won with the desire for peace and cooperation. THE END
