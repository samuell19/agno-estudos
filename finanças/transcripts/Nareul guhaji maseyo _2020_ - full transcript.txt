Hey, why didn't you answer the phone? I know your circumstances. I wouldn't ask you if it weren't that bad. Mom, dad's asking you to check the text. Then, pay me back some of it first. Yes, I said so, but... Mom. Mom! Seon-yu, after I finish this. No, dad's strange. Why does he keep saying sorry? I'll call you back soon. PLEAE DON'T SAVE ME - Come on, don't do that! - How about that? Do it! - Oh no! Please don't! - Do it quickly. - I'll count three. - Just look at him. One, two, three! Oh man! - Leave me, get away - He really does! My broken heart you make me crazy This moment is confusing Even if I try to forget you in the rain Leave me, get away... You guys talk loudly when I get here. The first transfer you have, huh? No, she's your first transfer. Will you introduce yourself? I'm Park Seon-yu. Well, introducing yourself is always awkward, huh? Now, your seat is... Jung-gook's next seat is empty? Why, you don't like your partner? If you sit next to Jung-gook, you won't get bored. Sir, I'll be her partner. OK, since Hyeon-a is the class leader, that would be good. Then, how about Jung-gook? It's ok. I actually prefer guys. - Oh! - Wow! No, that's not what I mean. Come on. What the... Hi. Oh, hi. You're taking the Math unit test today, right? Be quiet and take everything away from the desk. I'll be damned. Jung-gook, have you solved them all? No, not yet. Ah, what happened to the man yesterday? I don't know. He's coming today again. Wow, he's falling for you. Indeed, isn't he? If he comes today, it'll be amazing. That's what I'm saying. Oh, it's you. How was your school? Well, good. The teacher is nice and the guys are okay. There is a strange boy but the class leader is my partner. Gosh, look at the time. You should eat. Mom, can I try it? I already said no. You're still a little girl. No homework? Really Interesting Cut-Outs Hi, mom. Oh, yeah. What's got into you? Studying? I just... Jung-gook, look at my eyes. Were you playing a game? I knew it. Nothing happened today? Why do you keep asking it? Because you're a troublemaker. I am not! A girl was transferred to my class. But, she seems a bit strange. Strange how? Well... the thing is... Mom, I told you. He is at puberty now. What're you talking about? My Jung-gook is far away from it. Now, get back to your rooms and study. Hey, she's pretty? Gosh, I don't know. Pretty? Go away. God... Noisy, huh? Should we hang a curtain? I'm okay. But, I don't think you can sleep, Mom. I'm okay, too. Those people are... They're just strangers. - Try hard next time. - Okay. Hyeon-a, 100 points. Next, Park Seon-yu. Seon-yu also got 100 points. I think the average score of our class will go up. Next, Ahn Jung-gook. Some of you forge your parents' signatures. Just be honest with your scores and do better next time. Okay, Jung-gook? Yes. Here! Geon! Wow, so pretty. I just followed the book. Wow, amazing! I think it's the prettiest. Seon-yu, can I borrow this book? No, you can't. Sorry, it's my birthday gift from my dad. I'll ask my dad to buy it. Really Interesting Cut-Outs Seon-yu, will you join us in the academy? English and math. Yes, let's eat tteokbokki together after the academy. I like to study at home alone. You can concentrate better when studying alone. If you like these, would you have one each? Oh, really? Thanks. Big size doesn't mean pretty. - Right. - Pretty thing is the best! Mom! Where have you been? I've got a job. The art academy there. Hearing my career, they asked me to work from tomorrow. Really? I got 100 points from the math test. Oh, really? That's my girl! Shall we eat out tonight? We still have the leftover of the stir-fried cabbage. How about buying some meat and eat it with that? Good. Okay, let's go. It looks good, let's have a pork loin. No, the shoulder meat. Look, it's one dollar per 100 grams. But, loin is better. - Let's have the loin. - It's cheaper. Gosh... You have a good daughter. You'll make a good wife later. Hey, what're you doing? Take away your hand! Seon-yu, never come here, okay? Well, ma'am... You saw the news. Such people take young girls and do bad things to them. This world is a terrifying place. You need to have a cell phone again. I'm okay. I'm not okay. Without a group chatting, it'll be okay. Nobody here knows what happened to us. Na-hee, I'm In-kyeong. Seon-yu, are you home? My! Er? Hi, In-kyeong. Yes, it's me. Why you didn't answer? Take it. I was worried if I got the wrong address. In-kyeong, you should let me know first. I told you yesterday on the phone. Did you? You keep forgetting like a menopausal woman. Oh, wow. Spacier than I thought. Out of Seoul is good. I brought some dumpling. Let's eat. How is it, good? Better than your mom's? Mom's is better. I knew it. Shall we open a dumpling shop? You cook and I serve, how is it? Hey, mom got a job today in an art academy. Really? Yes. Well done, you can open an art academy in this town. Seon-yu must be happy. Eat. Oh, this... I remember it. You said you had lost it. Oh, I found it while moving. Wow, a diamond is a diamond. It's still gorgeous. Since it's too small, it's not worth much. Hey! Gosh, do you think I'll take your wedding ring... Do you think I would ask you to pay me by selling it? No, I'll have some money soon... Her dad's insurance... Why are they reviewing it so long? Bastards! How's your mother? Not good. She needs surgery again. Gosh, that's a huge deal to me. What about the woman running a supermarket? I think she's still in a bad situation. I really don't understand. How can she live like that? She can't swallow up your money. Well, I think humans are... Sometimes humans are really horrible. In-kyeong. I'm sorry. And thank you for helping us. No, don't say that. - Just eat dumpling. - You have it, too. - Yes, Seon-yu, help yourself. - Enjoy it. Here, open wide! Wâ€‹hoosh! It's good, huh? Go ahead, it's getting cold. Okay. - Oh, it's good - Tasty? Wow! Seon-yu is good at painting, too. What's this place? I just painted it. Why nobody's there? It would be gorgeous if it has some people. I can't draw people well. You don't need to be perfect. It's so bad. We'll continue doing it. So, go to the bathroom. Hey, shall we have a look? Let's go and look. Shall we draw a person for her? Hey, don't do that. Seon-yu will be happy with our help. A primitive family came to fish on a raft. But they forgot to bring the baits. So... well, then... Give me that. The primitive farts. So, the bubbles are coming up. The fish got angry and slapped them. He jumped into the the water to catch the fish, but he couldn't swim. Help me! Save me! - Hey! - What? We just tried to help you with drawing a person. Right? Sorry, I'll erase it. That's okay. Since it was ugly, I was gonna throw it away anyway. Don't bother. What're you doing? What's this? Not yours, huh? Dude, give it back! Dude? Did you call me 'dude'? Well, mom! It's the new girl's painting, and she tore it up when I scribbled on it. You made a mess again. Girls are supposed to love someone perfect like me, - handsome and smart. - Give me that. What's this place anyway? It seems spooky. Just go away! Mom? Sorry for being late. Why are you in the darkness? I bought some snacks you like. Mom, I can smell smoke from you. Oh, I had dinner at a BBQ restaurant. My welcoming party. Oh! What's that? Did you make it? Pretty. Do you like it? Yeah, I'm so happy today. I'd like to drink with you. - Here. - No thanks. It's okay. You're supposed to learn how to drink from mom. I learned it from my mom when I was at your age. Cheers! Are you okay? Yes, it's sweet. Is it supposed to be? What? I have a drunkard girl. Seen, then unseen, flickering The path is wrapped in fog Mom, let's not sing this song. Why not? Because it was dad's favorite? Can't we sing another song? Nope, I'll sing this song. Listen, Seon-yu. Sometimes, this song is ringing in my head. I hate your dad so badly, but I think I miss him. We shouldn't have thrown away all of his pictures. At least we should've kept one. Hi. Your book was on the floor. Thanks. Do you know she's putting on airs? She doesn't need an academy because she's so clever. No way. Do you think other girls are lying without any clues? They say she ignores someone who's bad at studying. Which page should we continue for Korean class? From page 207, Sir. Last time, you read it up to Won-jun. It's Seon-yu's turn today, isn't it? Why, no book today? It was here... Seon-yu also makes mistakes. Hyeon-a, can you share your book with her today? Baby Seagull, You can fly for sure. Breathe deeply. Park Seon-yu - And feel the cold rain... - Hey, this is Seon-yu's book. Many things will make you happy in your life. Water, wind, the sun... Well done. Now, why did the cat teach the baby seagull how to fly? Yes, Hyeon-a. Because the mommy seagull was going to die So she asked the cat to teach her baby to fly. Seon-yu, can you help me with arranging these books? Yes. The rest of you can go home now, OK? - Yes, Sir. - Yes, Teacher. Is the teacher doing well? Yes. She called me to ask if you're doing okay here. Why didn't you tell me? Because I'm doing fine here. Seon-yu, how about joining Wee Class? The counselors are great there. I'll call your mother. No, she'll worry about me more if I get counseling. And, I have to go to academies right away after school. I'm really fine. I promise. Okay, that's good but anything happens, you have to tell me, right? Yes. Well, you know... You won't talk about it to the others, right? Of course, I won't. Sorry, I thought it was mine. I didn't do it on purpose. Anyway, because of me, you were... I'm sorry. Anyway, who's the man? Is he your dad? Who do you think you are? Why are you annoying me? Yes, I'm bad at stuying. What? Don't let your cleverness ignore others. What are you talking about? Am I ignoring you because you're bad at studying? Isn't it true? Whatever you say. Then what? I envy you so much. Why? Because you know nothing. No, there's so much I know! Ye-ji, whenever I study, I miss you. Be responsible for that. Though I'm so cool and good at studying, don't bother with that. My heart is pounding only for you. And don't smile at anybody, please. When you do, I'm just... - Ugh! - Gee! Hey, grab it with your hands. You said you would do it. You said you would do it first. - Should I try? - Yes. - I try? - Yeah. I do try. No, it's joking. Gosh. Hey, what's going on? Touch it. Quickly. Are you afraid of touching it?

I'll live to fight another day. So, don't cry. And smile, okay? - Hi. - Hi. You can have it. My aunt brought it from the U.S. for her business trip. But I don't like chocolates. Wow, that's a very expensive one. Seon-yu must be happy. I'm good. It's not expensive. Just take it. No thank, I don't like chocolates, either. I see... Give me that. I love chocolates.

Is that why you're poor at studying? Don't say that. Then, have it alone. Seon-yu, it's In-kyeong. Open the door. How have you been? Gosh, it's hard. Mom will come home late. She said she would come soon. Do you want some snack? Right, Seon-young turned up. She married a younger guy. She was bluffing that she's so happy. I won't go to the reunion not to see her face.

I really can't understand her. Jung-gook, Itâ€™s you that I can't understand! Why did you follow her even there skipping the academy? I myself wanted to accompany her. You! She took your umbrella yesterday, right? Don't you care about me who's worrying about you? Dad works late everyday for you guys. Mom. He won't do it again. Why can't you be like your brother? Unlike others busy with girls, your brother only studies. Just do as he does! What's that attitude? I can't help it. Give me your phone. I have to play the game with my friends tonight.

Seon-yu. I'm so tired that I need to lie down. Mom, I feel dizzy. Really? What's wrong? Is your tummy upset? Mom, tell me how you and dad met first. I can't remember it well. Long long time ago... Long long time ago... Mom and dad went to Gangchon for college retreat. Yes, the lake we went often. Right. Dad asked me to ride on a rowboat and recited a poem he wrote. It was about a girl. Who was... just like me. Pretty brown eyes, a petite figure with a hearty laugh. Strangely, his bashful face kept popping up in my heart day and night. I think I fell into his trick. Seon-yu. Shall we... go see your dad? Just go to Gangchon and have some fresh air, saying hello to your dad. If you don't like it, I'll be there by myself. No, I'll go with you. Okay, let's go. Is it your first time? Yes. Look, unwrapped it like this, get rid of this sticker, and you get the wings. You can attach it on the panty. Okay? Change it every 2 to 3 hours. Teacher, I feel dizzy. Really? Well, you have a mild fever. I think it's because of the period. It means you become a grown-up. Congratulations. Don't you know? Starting the period means you become an adult. You can choose for yourself and love someone. Too early to say it? Anyway, tell your parents. They'll congratulate you a lot. Well, I won't be an adult. - My dad forgot about my birthday. - Oh, no. - You must've been annoyed. - Yes, I was really annoyed. - That was pretty harsh. - Yes, I'm so upset. I'm okay, go on. Well...

Until when should we read your face? Guys, enough. We should help Seon-yu. Help? What help? Did I ask you to help me? Hey, Park Seon-yu! Donâ€™t mess up the class anymore! What did Hyeon-a wrong to you? You were bullied in the last school because of your dad. Why do you take it out on us? Kim Sang-jin, isn't that too offensive? - Apologize to Seon-yu. - What are you? Well, since you like her, you can say that. We're all friends, aren't we? You're not my friend. You are only dangling about Seon-yu. Stop it and say sorry to Seon-yu! - Wrap up. - What are you? Hey, Ahn Jung-gook. Do you know me well? Are we close? Why do you nose into my affairs? He's right. I was bullied. That's why I transferred. That's why I misunderstood you guys. I'm sorry.

I'm relieved. Sorry. I'm really sorry. No, I also have many things to apologize to you. About your picture, I put it together and erased the scribbles. I'll bring it back tomorrow.
