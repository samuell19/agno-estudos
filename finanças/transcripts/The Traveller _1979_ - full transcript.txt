My stomach thinks my throat's been cut my last meal is a distant memory you want some meat? - May I have the wineskin? - Here I was lucky. Doors were opened for me they gave me bread, meat and fine wine it was a farm, about fifteen miles that way a young married couple.

First, your mother leaves... Even an animal wouldn't do that to its offspring you're taken in by a relative who feeds you on pigswill he works you until you faint from exhaustion - they did give me a hard time - Think about it one wretched master after another they beat you and starve you to death they were bad people, it's true the rich shit on the poor, suck their blood like leeches so the poor slit their throats in return that's humanity in this world all is ignoble and lowly everything here has a price...

She had it coming, the cheating whore Tomas, my friend, money is a fine thing one is allowed to do anything to get it - anything? - Yes, even murder religion, conscience, laws, that's for losers for success, sell your soul to the devil - but what of the punishment? - Punishment, my arse would you like to dress as a noble, with servants and a fine house? To lie in your bed with fair damsels? Of course, but I don't see how just listen to me and you'll live to be a rich man tomorrow, we take our first steps we will earn a few ducats I don't understand when we stopped at the inn, and you went to get wine... I heard two servants talk of a journey... They will go on tomorrow, to buy some land it seems their master, Lopez, is the region's richest man apart from dealing in land he's a usurer and moneylender what does that have to do with us? Boy, are you slow we'll ambush him and take all his gold I know just the place but he will be heavily guarded this won't be a robbery through Lopez's own greed, we will get the money without a fight here's the plan on that road, by some ash trees, there's an old house the floor has collapsed, leaving a very deep pit You gave that peddler a good slap, my lord made a noise like a hollow pumpkin. You may have killed him I had to I needed his clothes to disguise myself I understand, sir, but that poor peddler... Better for him if he does die the pit is through that archway. You must guide them to it - understand? - Yes, my lord Why did you decide you had to come with me, blanca? You're just a burden I know too well your weakness for inns and wenches I'll always watch you damn bloody cow, to the devil with you! Ready now... go! Sto.. Sto.. Stop here. Sto.. Sto.. Stop... Wh... what do you want, boy? Why do you stop us? You see, sir... that man... He's found this sack full of ducats he's a little... touched he gave me the sack, and showed me where he found it he does sound like an idiot so, what can I do for you? He found the ducats in that old house over there I slipped my hand under some rocks... And I felt more sacks but I couldn't get to them the rocks are too heavy for me to move by myself s-s-s several sacks, you say? Yes, sir. And I offer you a deal... Your men help me move the rocks and we'll split the ducats Rodrigo! You, roque and famorano... Go with this lad and help him won't you join us, sir? I-I-l wish I could, but my gout... I can't walk you'll have Rodrigo with you, so no funny business, right? Come on... What are you waiting for? - I'm scared - He really is mad, blanca Leave him, Carlitos!

Stay away... Juan! I can't believe this! He mocks and offends me, in your presence and you do nothing! Don't make such a fuss about a little piss, woman he's just a poor fool with jelly for brains - can't you see that? - Yes... Can't you see he's to be pitied? It would be a sin to attack such a one he plays with your necklace like a small child can't you see? A small child, yes, but with a big rod good heavens, look at the size of it - did you say something, blanca? - No, don't worry about it you never cease g-g-g... grumbling what's up with you today? Where are the others? What's going on? Don't worry, sir I've just come to tell you it'll take a bit longer the rocks are hard to move The sham is over, milord! We'll have all your gold the usurer and his cow wife wear fine clothes and jewels... While others starve strip them of everything, ducats, jewels, clothes scoundrels! Thieves! Villains! Maybe... But your greed is the cause of this a boy and a madman should be easy to trick, right? You'll end up on the gallows and then straight to hell I'm already in hell, you cow it's you and your scarecrow husband... Who'll end up in old Nick's cauldron! It'll be night soon and no-one will find us we'll either freeze to death or be eaten by rats - why did you choose this road? - It seemed to be the s-s-safest a wise choice then by the holy virgin... Why did I marry you? My mother warned me! Sh-sh-shut your mouth, you cow. I got the worst deal I'm a martyr. A martyr! Shut your mouth they were so keen to get the gold that they fell right into the pit they must have broken every bone. How they screamed... Pride, greed, lust, wrath, gluttony, envy, sloth how easy it is to condemn a soul. By the devil, how easy - my lord, is it good Booty? - Tomas, we are almost rich soon you will live like a lord I'll buy clothes in the next town. You shan't dress like a pauper let's knock on this door. We'll spend the night here what if they won't take us in? Remember, now we can pay we'll have a roof to sleep under I'm really tired I'll tie up the mule Good evening, madam forgive us, but the road is long and we are tired I saw the light and hoped we might find shelter come in it's a sad time for us, but we've never refused a traveler Tomas, look after the mule don't worry, I'll show the boy to the stables bring the bags in after you've taken care of the animal follow me My husband squandered our fortune we were the most powerful family around here we had a coat-of-arms, we had nobility all that's left is my maid petronila and two old servants he died in a duel on account of a woman the creditors bled me dry all I could save was this house and some land a sad story, lady urraca, I sympathise but none of that would matter if I could save my daughter I've consulted the best physicians none has given me any hope she will die soon why have you told me all this? I'm just a stranger and you... A fine lady I trust you, sir it's a long since I talked to anyone can I take a look at your daughter? - Are you a physician? - No my healing arts are better I've been to the spice countries, and learnt their secrets trust me let me see your daughter She's almost as fair as you what's her name? Berenguela tell me... What would you give for your daughter's salvation? Everything absolutely everything, even my own life then I shall save her count on it what do you want in return? I want you for one night. There is no other way I've not been with a man since my husband died what you ask matters more than my life you're asking for my honor That is my price, madam if my daughter is healed, then you shall have me get me hot water, and plenty of clean towels - you have a herbarium? - Yes take me there I need some herbs then I'll remain with her until dawn I must not be interrupted for any reason understood? My child madam... Your daughter is cured - I've honored my part of the deal - As I will honor mine I'll be waiting for you tonight I brought you some fruit - you're young and you must eat - Thanks many thanks, madam your master has healed my lady's daughter is he a sorcerer? Not at all! He's just a very wise man he spent some time in the indies. He knows many healing arts all the best physicians came to see berenguela... And they all said that the child was beyond hope then along comes your master and heals her in one night I don't get it. He saved her... You should be happy I fear his help may come at a great price It looks like it will be a lovely day I'm leaving, madam I'll not forget this night. And I'm certain you won't Beautiful woman I can't say which is fairer, her body or her soul a fine garden for my seed to grow in my lord Leonardo, you are lucky. She is such a kind woman we'll buy horses and clothes. I've big plans our look must be fitting Berenguela my child berenguela! My girl... dear god, no! Berenguela! She's dead? She's dead! I committed mortal sin for this for nothing I knew that traveler was the devil himself I knew it you will learn from me that human friendship... Is just another deception but, my lord I think of you as a friend as well as a master yes, but I must also benefit from it, of course yes, Tomas... Men murder, steal, cheat, envy, hate, and for what? To end up with the devil himself my lord, you paint such a dark picture of the world... I lose the will to live on the contrary, we must seek money and pleasure with those, life becomes a precious gift a treasure now, on with our travels we head for a famous inn, between burgos and aranda By the devil, this is a fine sword I'm sorry, my lord, but I don't like weapons Tomas, the hilt of a sword is like a little bird grip it too tightly, and you throttle it that's a rule that every good fencer... Must learn I'll sleep outside. I hear the Miller's wife is quite a woman she's having an affair with a swordsman the Miller went to aranda for some grain the lovers have a date, and I need solace sounds like a dangerous affair even I have heard of that swordsman - be careful, my lord Leonardo - Don't worry and rest assured that tonight I will enjoy that woman's delights you're leaving me alone, my lord? Alone? Tomas, haven't you understood that man is always alone? No more will you fornicate, braggart My love... What's taking you so long? At last you're here Oh, my nuno... You're so good, you scoundrel you like it better in the dark, don't you, my love? - Yes, yes - Nuno, you sound hoarse it's very damp outside yes, of course - Nuno, you're much bigger - Herbs... Some herbs I got from a witch nuno, I can't take it anymore do it... do it... Like that... Maria! Maria! Where are you? Damn, it's Ramiro - I thought he was away - Maybe the deal went wrong mother of god... hide... Quickly! Maria! Where are you? Ramiro, my husband. I was up here, in the hayloft I come home exhausted and then I go crazy looking for you - why are you back so soon? - The deal didn't happen I could have stayed at the inn, but I prefer my own bed especially with my own fair lady Ramiro, I'm glad you're back why are you naked in the hayloft? - Naked? - Yes, naked! It was too hot in my bedroom - you're a strange woman - It's true, I was hot well, I'm cold to the core come here, Maria... I need warming up a boot? A boot! With spurs - a boot, you say? - Yes, look, it's a boot how did it get here? A man... l smell a man here! Good evening, cuckold sweet virgin! That's not nufio my... my dear sir... This boot, this fine boot... Is it yours? Yes, of course it is yes, it's mine now give it back, you cuckold Turn around - pardon? Come on, turn round drop your pants - huh? Do it! Who are you? The devil, you whore the devil incarnate as for your nuno, you'll find him in the woods, stabbed berenguela, my child I don't want to give birth. You must not be born it's only been two days, yet I can feel you in my womb your strength... Is causing me... such pain We'll stop at burgos then continue on to court I never thought I'd see the city I told you, Tomas, with me, the world will be yours - If no-one comes, we'll die like this - They stripped us of everything - nothing left - It's a punishment after what we did to the usurer and his wife punishment? By Satan and all his legions, this is just part of the job Tomas, someone's coming! Here, brothers! Help us! Herel here... Dear brothers, you've saved us may god reward you the convent those friars mentioned must be near the nuns will take us in, and give us hot food and a bed and maybe more we beat and stripped those pilgrims that's quite a sin Tomas... You've travelled with me so long, and still you speak of sin? Come, the convent must be near we were in Santiago wonderful seeing so many pilgrims there and the stately swinging of the botafumeiro censer both our souls took great comfort... In walking the holy road in order to reach jubilance in this house, pilgrims are always welcome Mother elvira, in a village near compostela... I exorcised a girl... Inside whom dwelled beelzebub himself after a long struggle, he spewed from her mouth... As a stinking black ball are you a qualified exorcist, father? I am and I've solved some difficult cases - very difficult - Providence sent you, no doubt praise the lord praise him are you having problems? There's a demon in the convent three novices show signs of possession even I am beginning to feel attacked he constantly tempts me sister filomena she's so old, poor thing in bad health and eats too many beans from her farts she sounds in excellent shape, mother Don't worry, I will study the case... And cast that evil spirit out of the convent The wicked one strikes at night touches my breasts and tries to seduce me I fight with prayer and penitence but he's getting bolder tell me, mother, what does he look like? Does he take one form, or several? L... never open my eyes I just feel his hands on my body the case seems complex it will take a few days, but we will cast out this demon it will be difficult, for Satan is a cunning adversary but no demon can defeat me a fine turnip, thick and long yes, father. Turnips grow well here - the secret must be the irrigation - Yes, irrigation is good here who's he? He grew up in the convent he was found abandoned he was already here when I took over the place he's a simple soul, and helps us with the hard work this garden certainly produces good turnips - I'm sorry, father? - I was thinking about produce and now, please, I'd like to be alone to meditate as you wish. The bell will ring when dinner is ready Who did that?! Don't move! What have I done to you? What do you want? For the next four days, Mr. demon, stay away from the novices and the abbess, or I'll cut your dick off and then slit your throat yes, father, whatever you say. I swear Tell me, mother superior, is the devil married? No, of course not yet he is always depicted wearing great big horns I don't understand, father does he have a tail shaped like an arrow? Maybe he has, but in some other place not shaped like a harpoon, and more tempting and pleasurable father, please! The things you say... Most people, even wise men, claim he has hooves, like a goat... That he's colored black or red... - And he smells of sulphur - We all know that, my lord... Father As an exorcist, I know him well you yourself could be the devil or this man, or that other one or even you, mother superior or I, myself or that old nun who snores and farts like an earthquake Tonight, master Tomas... Mother superior will know what a real exorcism feels like and tomorrow I'll take care of those sweet novices what if there really is a demon in the convent? - There's been one for years - What? That young rascal who works in the garden... By day by night, he amuses himself by visiting the cells nice work - indeed but you know what? The flowers he's cultivating will be plucked by another Mother... Stand up do as I say Take off your clothes - all of them? - You must you must be as the lord brought you into the world Stand like on a cross - The wicked one tempts you here? - Yes... yes And also... between my legs Get thee behind me, Satan! Begone! I'm the only cock in this Coop, my brother my head is spinning By all the devils... What happened? Where am I? My lord Leonardo... you've been fighting death for five days you a fever... Like you were burning in hell my poor neck how it hurts. I can't remember a thing that gardener fellow hit you so hard... He nearly broke your back - then he came looking for me - Rascal... criminal he had a knife that even goliath would have found big he came looking for me and took me to you when I saw you, I feared the worst forgive me but you were bleeding like a pig that rat, took me by surprise he made me carry you, threw us out of the convent by the way, you're heavy as hell my back still aches - where are we”? - In a whorehouse, my lord the only place that would take us in from convent to whorehouse... How strange life is the madam is called leonor, a fine-looking woman seems all the important men come here for fun from all the big towns around, from burgos, aranda... Even from the court itself good, master Tomas that's very good seems we're back in business This is dona leonor, the madam sit down, my boy I see you're back among the living I prayed for you and the saints always listen to me dear lady, I don't know how to thank you for your kindness I'll never forget this I'll clean your wound and change the bandages I was telling your boy there is work here for both of you occasionally, some rather rough fellows come here... And we need a strong man... To knock some sense into them Madam... do you have a garden? No The fruits we offer do not grow in a garden no garden, no gardener good as soon as I'm well Tomas and I will work for you with great pleasure you went with la palentina last night so what? I was your first, and I can be very jealous you woke up the bird, now one nest is not enough - but my nest is the best - If you're so sure... Let the bird try others it'll always return they're fancy people we'll get a nice pile of ducats - will they bring guards? - Of course the roads are dangerous I certainly know a bit about that, my sweet come along, get a move on, we have guests coming we have to get ready life here is good here, eh, master Tomas? Relaxing, lots of good food beautiful women You've learned the ways of love - which nest will it be tonight? - I'm tired tonight I shall sleep - me too tomorrow those rich men arrive... Ready for us to empty their pockets I can already hear their gold jingling my lord, I'd like to... I don't know... It doesn't matter there's something you want to say go ahead, speak and I'll listen my life has been short and wretched I've known nothing but hunger, pillage, death I don't like the times I'm living in, my lord the past was no better, nor will the future be this is not the work of time, but of man... And man makes the same mistakes and commits the same sins the future... I have faith in the future a time when war, injustice and misery will be ended the future, eh? Have faith in the future? You're almost falling asleep come Sleep... And tonight you'll see the future you'll be surprised how much better the world will be You slept badly? I had horrible nightmares horrible - you liked the future? - How did you know? No My dreams were terrifying they made no sense at all the future can't be like that perhaps you're right, Tomas my lord Leonardo... Who are you? I'm no-one just a humble traveler - I knew you'd come, you rogue - Does it bother you? I'm flattered come in let's see if your weapon... Is up to the job you'll be amazed I'm a great swordsman Having fun, Don ifigo? Lust and gluttony, together like this... Brings joy to my heart it's like ancient Rome and you're the vestals my mistress leonor loves the ancient times says they were better than today obviously your mistress knows a great deal about pleasure yes, indeed I'm her best pupil, and her favorite too What's that young boy called? Tomas. He's not been here long he's handsome a bit rough, but good-looking very good looking - aren't I good-looking? - Yes, of course, but... Dona leonor...? - I'll pay any price for that boy - The price is high, Don ifigo... Very high name it - at least... - How much? - 100 ducats done Your eyes sparkle as if you hear the jingling of gold Don liigo crespo, that fat, pink man... The one who looks like a pig? Yes, he's rich and very greedy... And when he wants something, he'll pay any price and our porcine guest wants to hump Tomas I noticed, my fair procuress. But the lad is my friend sure, you old rascal and he'll pay 100 ducats... For the delights of your young squire's rear Don lfigo is a whimsical character no arsehole on earth is worth a hundred ducats we'd split it fifty for you and fifty for me - no friendship is worth 100 ducats - Then it's tonight? Tonight, my sweet trollope, tonight pigface there must sleep in my bed... With at least three of his men ready the lad is wiry, but tough he'll be hard to hold down So much work help at dinner get the rooms ready take care of the horses my bones ache I'll sleep like a log let me go! My lord Leonardo, we are under attack! Who are you? Pull his pants down and hold him in position what are you going to do? Let me go, you fiends!

Fifty for you and fifty for me 100 ducats, not a bad Booty is it my queen of whores? And all for just one arse I'm sure when you took us in, you saw Tomas as a good investment I'm a businesswoman I can see that I can see that, even though your face is not too fair... And you're a bit fat... You do have beautiful eyes I can have my whims too, Mr. Leonardo me too, dona leonor, I love money... And 100 ducats is more than fifty you're just a dirty thief! True, very true I'll also take the horses of your fine guests - don't try to wake them - Are you going to kill me? I should but you were good in bed, and that saves you now, drink to my success come on, keep drinking and now drink that one come on My god... Why did you let it be born? It's... it's a monster show it to me I I want to see it no, my lady you shouldn't that's my son. Don't you understand? - My son! - It's Satan's son it's the devil's spawn, and it must die now, while there's still time I'm the sinner it's not his fault I carried him in my womb please swear to me... That you won't hurt him but we cannot... We must not allow it to live swear to me... That you won't harm him that you'll protect him swear it! I swear Burgos 22 I eagues My dear Tomas... Soon I'll introduce you to the finest people at court you'll meet their majesties you'll have all you desire you'll be rich and admired... And when I die, you'll inherit my entire fortune first of all, I want to find my former master I want him to remember me well my men will find him and if he took the main road, then we'll find him very soon We meet again, master Leonardo - you missed me, didn't you? - Indeed six days I've hunted you but I would have spent years looking for you I would have gone down to hell if necessary may I sit up? Please do, sir So boring I must admit I'm astonished, Tomas I never thought you'd enjoy taking it up the arse or that you'd become fat ifiigo's whore I thought you'd try to get revenge on your porcine rapist that's how I felt at first but then I recalled your wise teachings my arse's honor was taken, so I decided to make the most of it Remember when you showed me in a dream... A dreadful, apocalyptic future? I'd like to know what awaits me at court I believe you have this ability to see the future - will you indulge me? - Why, of course, master Tomas you'll have money, fame, glory. The most beautiful women indulge in every evil. Cheat, steal, murder you'll die an old man, in peace, surrounded by your loved ones... And then you'll go straight to hell! So, master of thieves, I know my own fate now, you'll know yours beat him until every bone is broken and then, do what you want with him Angels of hell! Come to my aid! Get these men off me! Wretched man. You'll have an unworthy end Oh lord! How could you give your life for these pigs? I don't understand I don't understand! What are you doing? Thieves bastards sons of bitches! Swines Sons of bitches... Don't be afraid, brother, I come in peace I smelled your cooking... And my poor, empty innards led me here I couldn't help it charity is waning in the world, my friend no-one helps the poor yet, you seem to be doing quite well nobody gave me anything I stole all of this I need company, and someone to talk to I'll share my food in return my loneliness is unbearable let me tell you an old legend, a tale of the devil I'll happily listen, I like legends once upon a time the devil was getting bored so, transformed into a mortal, he visited earth he accepted the weaknesses of the flesh he could get sick, or even die he rarely used his powers, for he thought things would be easy he started off poor, so he could grow through mischief and evil what human could beat him? For he was the devil - I want to hear more, brother - Of course...
