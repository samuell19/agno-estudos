SAN FRANCISCO, AMERICA Charitable Las Vegas event hosted by the American Chinese Society to raise funds for the world's hungry children is now officially launched. We've invited the God of Gamblers, Mr. Ko Chun, as our guest-of-honor. Though Mr. Ko has retired from the gambling field, he still sent his principal disciple, Mr. Michael Chan, as our guest-of-honor. Mr. Michael Chan, please! Everyone, my master has retired from the gambling field. But he once said that in all charitable functions, we'll donate our money and put in our effort. Bullshit! What's a God of Gamblers? What's so great about it? It's just a swindler. CN, don't mess around. He's a new immigrant from Hong Kong called CN Tai. He's very cocky, but don't mind him. I've never seen a cocky man before. You've seen one today. Show your talents, if you have any. I don't mind if somebody makes a donation. Remember. You said that yourself. People like us have plenty of money. Each person will reserve one table. If you are able to bet a maximum of 100,000 dollars in one game, and win one million from me, I'll give you an extra ten million dollars! Your master will lose the title God of Gamblers if you lose. We'll call him God of Shits instead! Four decks? What is it? Want to quit? Casino rules. I'll cut the cards. All right. Here. Here's 100,000 dollars. All right! Deal! Split. Split again. Split it again. He has 16 aces, all in a go. Split again. How come there are so many sets in one? No matter how many sets, it's still considered as one. There's only one with 17 points. The rest are either three or four points. You'll lose for sure. Hit! All right! I'll take you down in a round! Face card! -Face card! -Face card! Your hands are trembling. Jeez! We're playing blackjack, not competing for the largest point. You've lost! With 16 sets of cards and 100,000 dollars each, That's 1.6 million dollars and you'll donate an extra 10 million. A great master breeds an excellent disciple. The master is the God of Gamblers. You who travel around the world for charity functions can be called the Knight of Gamblers. Uncle, the noodles have turned pasty! Don't let the boiling soup spill out. Is it ready yet? You've spent so much time on cooking a bowl of noodles. I'm ladling out now, little brat! What a hungry ghost you are! Why don't you bring it here next year? Hey! -What kind of head is this? -A human's head. The results of Mark Six have been announced. Let me see. Number 18. Damn! It only strikes three numbers each time. Little brat, don't eat just yet. Help your uncle by using your special power and make me get all six numbers right. I've told you a hundred times! The money we make from my special power can only be used for charity purposes. We can't spend it. -If I spend it the first time-- -You'll get bad luck. The second will send you to hell and the third will kill you. Hey, the first time we won from a gambling den, we got beaten up right after that. Bad luck! That's why we donated the ten million dollars we won last time. We'll go to hell if we dare spend the money again. I won't go out. How will I go to hell, then? You don't believe me? This is the money left from our last donation. Ms. Wong Jing. What's up? We live under the same roof. I'll do you a favor. No need to work at the night club tonight. -Are you going to support me? -That's right. This is for you. -Just spend the whole night with my uncle. -You've become rich? No, just being flirtatious. Come on. Don't waste time. That's right. Be quick. What's wrong with you? Always throwing men's underwear! Are there no ladies at home? Hey, Sing. We're uncle and nephew. Let's do it together. Hey, where are you going? We're so lucky! I said we'll go to hell. Do you believe me now? No. Wait, what's happening? -Going to hell. -Seriously? -Ouch! -Ouch! The way you fell down was funny. Everybody has got their soft spots. Mine is right in the head. What the hell can you say? Nothing. You look so cool now. How would I dare to say anything? You're not eating, right? Here it is! What do you call this new way of eating noodles? What? I figured this out myself. What the hell can you say? Little brat, hear me out. Given our talents, why should we be reduced to eating instant noodles? It's true. We can't spend the money we won using your power. You might as well learn the art of gambling properly. Then, you'll win money, women, and everything. After the great guys left by 1997, I'll be the next Li Ka Shing. Great! I'll be Carol Cheng! It's Cheng Yu Tung! That's right. From whom should I learn? The God of Gamblers? That's right. From him! When you become his disciple, you can win the entire world. And you can provide for me for life. Uncle, I didn't say I would feed you for life. -Ouch! -Haven't you learned at school that you should treat your uncle as a parent? All I know is that Mao Zedong is closer than our parents! Be good. If you become a disciple of the God of Gamblers, -it'll be awesome. -Is it that easy? How? Write and tell him that I adore him and ask him to take me as a disciple? It's so old-fashioned to write a letter. We'll make a video. What did you say? Video means video recording. It's useless. We don't even know where the God of Gamblers is. You're right. Sing, you can see through the wall. Use this power and see where the God of Gamblers is. But he might not be in the neighborhood. He can be miles away. Unless I use the Penetrating Eyes. Hey, who are you? I'm Sing. What are you doing? Relaxing my eyes nerves. You scared me! -Let's begin. -All right. Get started. What is it? What did you see? I can see the God of Gamblers. -Where is he? -He's gambling. Where is he gambling at? -What's up? -Nothing! -What did you see? -The God of Gamblers. What is he doing? He's wearing a pair of fancy socks. -What is it? -Someone fired the gun. There were bullets in the air. Then I can't see a thing. Don't worry. Use your Penetrating Eyes again. I'm not a fairy. I can only see it once in a while. What should we do? Fret not. I've heard the disciple of the God of Gamblers is in Hong Kong. We'll shoot a video and ask him to pass it on to his master. -Will it work? -Let's shoot it first. Start! God of Gamblers, Your Highness, I'm Sing. I went to Macao when I was three and entered the Casino when I was four. Became a first-rate gambler when I was five and a master when I was six. But my whole family left when I was seven. I've achieved nothing now that I'm 27. So, I wish to become a disciple of the God of Gamblers -and learn the art of gambling. -Hold on. What do you mean by that unzipped pants? I just wanted to scare the God of Gamblers. -You can't even frighten me. Put it away. -All right. -Let's do it again. -You can't mumble the way you just did. -I've tried my best. -That's the problem. -Give me another chance. -No! Let me show you. All right. Let's exchange positions. -Come and hold the camera. -All right. Zoom slowly at my head. -Try your best to learn. -Got it. Your Highness, the God of Gamblers, I'm Rotten Sing. Uncle, are you pregnant? Stop that! Be serious. I'm Rotten Sing, a 27-year-old with no achievements. But I have a kind heart. I beg you to take me as your disciple. Let me learn your skills and use them to help the weak, serve our society, and dedicate my life to our country. For freedom, love freedom. Long-living freedom! -Okay? -Okay. Okay. We can mail the tape to them now. Mail the tape? Who's seeking the master? Do what I've just done. No. There may be thousands of such tapes mailed to him. Everyone does the same. Really? If we want to stand out from the rest, we should bet. Bet? Yesterday, my Filipino maid passed by the market. A hawker said that there's a guy called God of Gamblers which is you. I was shocked. It's just a joke. There are actually people who dare call themselves the God of Gamblers. They take me as a faker! Well, I'm the Saint of Gamblers. You wear contact lenses when you're betting on cards, but my eyes can see through the cards. This is called special powers. Here is an ace. I only have to rub it lightly. It will instantly turn into a twisted ace because I haven't used my power yet. When I do, I can even change it to a set of mahjong! I'm lying? I say you're dumb. What are you looking at? Not happy? Give me a call, then. Of course, you have to pay me a few million dollars. What? Don't you need to pay the learning fees? Call me at Hong Kong number, 3345678. Let me repeat. Hong Kong number, 3345678. I don't care if you don't call me. It's your loss. Don't call me after ten o'clock because I'll be sleeping. Bullshit! I haven't seen you for a year and you've learned all the skills of the God of Gamblers. You even gained the title as the Knight of Gamblers. -Smart! -Thanks! To avoid unnecessary troubles, our trip back to Hong Kong will be planned by Mr. Sheung Shan. Good. Nobody will know I'm the Knight of Gamblers. I'll call for a press conference two days later to introduce you and our plan of the charity casino. Knife, is the place comfortable to live in? Hey, I was about to ask you. How did you manage to buy this house? An Indian used to live here. He always made his dog bite me. I was poor back then and lived in a small house down there. Every night, I stared at this big house and told my girlfriend, "I'll expel them and make them live down there one day, and I'll live here all by myself." My dream came true. One only has to try his best to make money. Nothing is impossible. A Kuwaitian lived here once. He went bankrupt after Iraq invaded Kuwait. -So, I bought the house. -I see. Hello? All right. Come over. Hey, who is it? Lung Kau! Who is that? I'm Lung Ng. She's Lung Kau. Who do you think she is then? What you've said is so philosophical. I don't understand! Hey, are there nice clubs in Japan? Take me for a drink. Your master asked me not to bring you to night clubs, nor can I introduce girls to you so that you won't discredit the title of the God of Gamblers. I was just testing you. You're a true friend of my master. You never would have ruined his fame. I have to go. -Talk to my men if you need anything. -All right. -Goodbye! -All right. Goodbye! Hey, Crow, please. -Boss? -Yes! How's my house? I've rented out the ground floor. I'm staying on the first floor. I see. Hey, call my girl and ask her to come over. I'm at the Indian's house up on the hill. -Hurry. -Your girl got married, boss. My girl got married? I have met a great girl. She admires you. I'll call her right now. Great but-- -That's all! -Hey. -Step aside! -You can't come in here. -Step aside! -Hey, who are you? Hey! You must be my senior, the Knight of Gamblers. I'm your junior, the Saint of Gamblers. What's up? Master and you must have watched my vi... -Video. -Yes, video. A talented guy like me wants to be under you. What more can I say besides congratulations? Congratulations. -Hey. -Yes. Over here. When will Master be back? You're so mean. You can't take your eyes off me. You make me lose all thoughts. -Though my outfit is nice. -That's right. -No chair. -Ouch! -Hey. -Here! What is it? Don't ever let the other party read your mind. What do I have in my mind? I don't know. Ask the banana if you want to know. I got it. Though it's quite huge, the decoration is pretty good. But not everyone can have aces! Four aces. Ladies and gentlemen. Five cigarettes! Awesome! But you've played too much. Excuse me. Hold it. We're equals in this game. We need to go for another round. If I win, you have to take me to see Master at once. -If I lose-- -Don't ever bother me again. How are we going to play? The highest rank wins. All right. You're the guest. You go first. Please! I'll make you take the lowest rank. Let's see the cards. -It seems luck isn't with you today. -Really? Even if luck is with you, you may not beat me. It's difficult not to win over you. Your card's with me! You managed to swap the card. Brilliant. You can make a card out that way. You've got great special power too. But it's not a proper skill. Thanks. Master can have disciples like you and I. He'll be extremely happy. -It's good to see you two! -He isn't in Hong Kong. Excuse me! -Hey! -What's the matter? Nothing. Those two who play magic insisted to meet Master. They just wouldn't leave. We won't quit until we meet Master. Yes, we won't leave! That's easy. Damn! We should use the most direct way to kick someone out. You're interesting. You dare come back? I'm-- No explanation. Come with me. Hey, don't be too noisy. Go to the first floor quietly. There's a big round bed in the middle room. You can take a bath if you want to. I'll give you a nice wine. Hey! You're a good fighter among women. Good enough to handle sex maniacs like you. Not exactly true. What's the matter? -Brother! -Nothing! What? Brother? This is my sister, Lung Kau. The Senior Inspector of the Hong Kong Police Unit. She was the bodyguard for the Queen when Her Highness came. I could tell at first glance. Both of you pull long faces. He's the disciple of the God of Gamblers. -Chan-- -Hey! My name's Michael. How nice, right? Your name is Lung Kau? Do you have an English name? Kowloon! Kowloon? What happened earlier was just a misunderstanding. I'm not that kind of guy. I'm that type of generous and elegant guy. That's right. -Boss! -What? The gorgeous girl is here! Her name is Fantasca! She agreed that she's not going home tonight. Great! What kind of person are you? Hey, we're still coming back? Aren't you afraid they'll use a grenade this time? So, never resort to violence. We're here to get him to talk to us. -Talk? Do you mean negotiation? -No. Later, we'll mess up his place and give him a sleepless night. Then, he'll come out and talk to us. That's right. Let's go. -The joke is funny, right? -Yes, boss. -Hey, have you heard of that joke? -No! I haven't said it. I never listen to jokes. Interesting! Hey, let me pour you a drink. Sorry. I'm sorry! Sorry. The glass moved! I'll pour you another one. Maybe the table is lopsided. Be on alert. Those two who came today surely harbor evil intentions. -They won't give up so easily. -Which two is he talking about? Us. I heard that. Hey. Both of them have been frightened to death. I think they won't come again, right? Let's not-- Enough about them. Let's eat. You can't see me. You just can't see me. I think they are gone. They know we're outside. I wonder if they heard us. Of course. He's the disciple of the God of Gamblers. He can even hear the dice. -Of course he heard us. -You're right. Hey, both of you were staring at each other just now. But why it was as though he couldn't see you? Because I've used my most powerful special power. -What is it? -Hypnosis. -Hypnosis? -That'll affect their brain activities and make them not see anything. What's more powerful is that once I used my ability, I can make them have different illusions. Really? Show me. You're a bitch. -You're a bitch. -Damn it! Boss, you've been after the master for over a year now. I'm sure you can create a three, right? Please teach me so that I can make a living out of this skill. Three! I failed again. I learned almost all his gambling skills after following him for a year. Look. Turns out creating a "three" is the toughest one. It works only twice out of ten times with me. Master said I couldn't concentrate. That's why I fail at times. -Is it that difficult? -Yes. Other gambling skills will make you win a lot. Lend me some money. Lend you? I'm poorer than you. Master has said that 95 percent of the money won has to be used for charity purposes. Only five percent goes into our pockets. That means you get only 50 cents out of 10 dollars? That's right. That's why I'm so poor. Be careful! Gosh, why didn't you let me down earlier? -Hi. -What is it? Nothing. I feel so sorry about this morning's incident. Right. Are you free for dinner tomorrow? I'll be accompanying the Governor's wife to Southeast Asia for a visit. I see. That's right. All the more you should cherish tonight. -I have a fiancé already. Save it. -Thank you. Don't feel embarrassed. It's just that she's got no taste. All right. I'll let you have a taste of having illusions. Are you really mad? No. Get back in here, then. You asked me to. Hurry. All right. This is for you. What I love most is such blossoming flowers. I'm glad you love them. So, we have to make the most out of tonight. Don't. Let's take a bath first. I'm going to take a bath. I'll be back in a minute. Sure. I'll wait for you. Why don't you wait for me on the bed? Sure. What are you doing? What are you doing here? Do you know you entered the wrong room? Do you? Do you know that you're on the wrong bed? Since you love it, I'll let you have the whole room. The world is going to change! Don't think a killer can enter any room he likes! You take your host's house as your own. I'm sure I've entered Lung Kau's room. Did I run into a ghost? You can't see me. You... You can't see me. You can't do anything to me. Abracadabra. You can't see me. You'd better leave at once. I'll call the cops if I see you again. We just come here to seek a master. Why are you treating us like this? Are you done yet? No! I insist to keep talking. Kill me. Even if you stab my eyes, cut my throat, hollow my heart out, -punch my-- -No! You can't hit there. If you don't agree, I'll kneel here until he dies. -Please agree. -Are you being shameless? Ignore them. Let's get inside. Please. -Please help us out! -Please. Or I'll be in a terrible situation. Please! -Stop bothering me! -Please! Please help us out. I'm begging you. -He's gone. -I know. Hey, are we really going to kneel here? Sure. He's just afraid of talented guys. So, we must be patient. When there's a will, there's a way. Dad. Hussein, what about the appeal to the Privy Council? It's not settled yet. Sorry, Mr. Chan. We have used Queen Counsels three times. But we're still rejected by them. I've expected this before you came in. Ko Chun made me guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. I won't let him off easily. The God of Gamblers, Ko Chun, is now like a coward. He's hiding away in South America and enjoying himself. It's hard to track him down. But I heard that his disciple, Knife, reappeared and got a nickname, the Knight of Gamblers. We'll approach him first. You want to... Not only I want the God of Gamblers to lose his fame, but I'll also use his name to cheat all the millionaires in South East Asia. Dad. Can't I take a break? This is tough. We don't have to kneel all the time, right? We do! He's watching us. He wants to test our patience. Hey, kneel on your own. I'm going to take a cup of tea. I'll buy you a chicken dumpling. -I won't provide for you in the future. -Don't. Watch out! Bulletproof glass? Leave quickly. I'll cover you. It's not New Year yet. They're burning firecrackers already? No. It sounds like gunshots. Even if it is, it must be fake. Fake? That can't be. The doors have been blown up. What are you afraid of? It's just the door. You're not the one being shot. Do you get it? What? Look. I just got shot. -It's fake. Does it hurt? -Yes. It proves that they are testing you. Why don't they test you? -You're right. Let's go. -All right. You have a gun? -No. -Yes. We do? Don't play with that! Let's go! Close the door! -Catch it! -Roger! Ouch! -Let's go. -All right. Hold on. Anesthetize him. Keep him alive. He might be useful later on. All right. Slide down with me. I'll take you to where I used to live. Here we are. How is your hand? It hurts. Hey, so many people are after you. You've got a lot of enemies? Yes. That's serious! How should I know? Cut the crap. Get inside first. What are you doing? You've got a lot on your mind. How do you know? I just put my finger on your head and I'll know what's on your mind. Your mouth to find out what you ate. And your head to know what you've touched. And your... Crazy! He actually believed it. Hey! Hey! -Crow! Hey! -Hey. Why are you at my house? I have such bad luck and is now living at the foot of the mountain. Why are you here? You're living here? This is my old house! -Boss. -Hey. Boss, what's up? Someone came to kill us. Let me make a call first. -The phone is mine. You can't use it! -You won't even let me use it? The ground floor has been rented out. Come up to my place and use mine. No! I don't believe I couldn't touch you. Hi, any news about Lung Ng? Thank you. Sorry for the trouble. Thanks. -Can they find him? -That's right. There has been no sight of Lung Ng. Mr. Sheung Shan has been killed too. He was the only one who knew I'm the disciple of God of Gamblers. Dead? Right. Why are they after you and Lung Ng? How would I know? I have a way to find Lung Ng. But I don't know if you believe it. -Your penetrating eyes. -No, it's the Penetrating Eyes. I can see a bar and a car is approaching it. MONG LO Yes, Lung Ng is in the car! Two guys covered him with a bag and carried him into the bar. Nice one, Lung Ng. Though he passed out, he's still stylish. Who hit me? Me! What's the bar called? It's Mong Lo. MONG LO This is it. -It's here. -Let's get inside. -Hold on. -What is it? -Something is wrong with your look. -Really? -Nothing is wrong. -I don't mean that. You're easily recognized. -You'll just alert the enemy. -That's right. Let the two of us go in first. If something goes wrong, I'll shout for you. All right. -Wait here. -Got it. -What do you want? -What do you have? Everything. How about mixing Chinese wine, Chinese medicine, and Vitasoya? Then, add an egg and stir it. Plus a drop of ink. You have that? Yes. -One for each person here. My treat. -All right. I'lI have orange juice. Ouch! How are you? Are you all right? Yi Mong? Yi Mong, where have you been? Do you know how hard I've been searching for you? I'm not Yi Mong. You've got the wrong person. Stop joking. If you're not her, who would you be? My name is Mong Lo. I own this bar. Are you really not Yi Mong? Hey, are you really not Yi Mong? I thought the kids are inexperienced. That's why they used such old-fashioned tricks to hit on the girls. But a mature man like you would actually use such tricks to hit on the girls too. No, I'm not that... Mature? I'm mature. Take a seat. Excuse me, miss. Can I have a look at your armpit? I always think a man with a mustache, a big belly, and over the age of 40 will make a true man. Those wearing fancy T-shirts and a watch with cartoons are just kids. You're right. Hey. -What do you want? I'll buy you a drink -I want... -I want... -I want-- Please bring us two Tequilas. Please! -Go. -All right. -Sir, what would you like? -It makes no sense. Two something La. All right. Sex maniac of the era! Right, Ms. Mong Lo said that she's not feeling well. Ms. Mong Lo is unwell. I'll send her back. You stay here. What are you doing? Trying to steal my girl? She said she's not Yi Mong. She's Mong Lo. You shouldn't steal anyone whose name has the word "Mong". You get all the girls with the name "Mong" and I can only dream of having sex? I'm over 40 this year. Be respectful to the elderly and let me have a beautiful dream. Go away. Let's go. Be careful. Hey! Get in the car! Are you calling me? Yes. Good morning. What are you doing? You haven't slept the whole night and you're making so much noise early in the morning. What's the matter? -What's the matter? -I didn't want to say it. But I'm at a loss. I can't help myself from not telling you. Last night, my uncle stole my girl. He stole my girl. He's a born cunt-struck. He's unscrupulous. He's a beast. What are you talking about? You lied to me. You said you would ask around about Lung Ng. Instead, you were fighting over a girl. -Don't ever talk to me again. -Hey! Please let me finish. Hey! Let me explain. It's important to me. She was my first love. I've never kissed a girl in my whole life. Stop telling me all these. I think you'll die if you shut up for 30 minutes. You're wrong. I won't die. I'll agree to everything if you shut up for half an hour. You said that yourself. We'll bet on that, then. If I shut up for half an hour, you take me to the master at once. All right. -All right! -Hey! These two steps are broken. No wonder he skipped it. You can't trick me. Are you tired? Tell me if you need help. What? You don't need help? I'll leave you be if you say nothing. Excuse me! Hey, Sing! Where's that little brat? Sing! Hey, what are you doing? Beating the dog early in the morning? Sing! Knife, have you seen Sing? Watch him. Hey, are you all right? You're swearing! I didn't offend you. Why are you swearing at me? Speak! Where have you been last night? At Mong Lo's place. -What did you do at her house? -Ate egg tarts! That's all, right? There's more. What else? Drank milk tea. -That's all, right? -Yes. You're out of your mind. She said she's Mong Lo, not Yi Mong. Stay away from anyone with the name "Mong". Why? There's no room for discussion even if you're my nephew. I thought of discussing with you, in hopes that you'll give me half your special power. Half? The egg tarts made you crazy? Remember the three don'ts for special power. First, don't use it to make money and enjoy yourself. Second, don't assault women. How about men? -That'll be fine. -But I won't. Third, no foul language before the ability is diffused. Committing any one of them, you'll lose the power. Since your power is transmitted through me, you committing the don'ts will make me lose my power too. Don't worry. After I've shown off my power, I'll return all of it to you. -I'm leaving. -Wait. -What is it? -Since you've just got special powers, you have to be tested first. Not everyone can have special powers. Remember. Even if you have it, you shouldn't show off. I won't. Your voice does. No, come on. Hurry. All right. Get ready. How is it? How come it doesn't work? -No? The bricks have all been smashed. -But my head is bleeding. You should or your head would have been blown off. You're right. I thought there's a test? I wanted to test the hardness of the bricks. So, I made use of your head. Basically, this test has nothing to do with your head. -I see. -You may go and hit on the girls. Luckily, it has nothing to do with my head. -If not, my head will be hurt. -Don't be silly. Why would I do that? -Hey, it's you. Do come in. -Sure. Eat up. Why are there so many people eating egg tarts in your house? They are regular clients at my bar. They're such a nuisance. Always coming here to hit on me. They are rich. They just wouldn't leave no matter how I drive them away. -I'll make them go away. -Don't. It'll affect my business. You're right. Yesterday, you told me you've got special powers, right? -Yes. -Why don't you gamble with them to win all their money and make them lose face? Well. You can't spend the money you win. I won't spend it. -All right. -Sing, come here! -What is it? -Look. "The disciple of God of Gamblers built a charity ship and will hold a press conference tomorrow." Someone must be claiming to be you. Why does he do that? Perhaps, he wants to use my master's and my name to cheat the rich in the name of charity. He'll swindle them out of all their money. How can he do such things? We'll reveal his identity when he's holding a press conference. No way, if we board the ship like this, nobody will believe our identities. We need money to bet on if we have to gamble. We need to find money. From where? A friend of mine has a gambling den. But I need your help. -You stay here. -Yes? Call the police when you hear me shouting. Sure, boss. No, it should be Mr. Michael. Mr. Kau! -Mr. Kau! -Hey. Knife, long time no see. -You ran away? -No. I've been doing business in Mainland. Darn it! Are you blind, son of a bitch? He's my younger cousin. A great entrepreneur. Very rich. Let's cheat his money together. Last time, it was your elder cousin. This time, it's your younger cousin? I almost lost to that dumb elder cousin of yours. Look at him. He's dumber than my elder cousin. -Hey, what's your name? -My mom's name is Wong. -I asked for your name. -My elder cousin is Michael. -I'm asking for your name! -Michael Jackson. -Your cousin doesn't talk sensibly. -That's right. Really! Do you want to play baccarat or pai gow? Let's see. BACCARAT Why is there a blanket for baccarat? Will the table catch a cold? Do I need to explain? Can't I put it there? What do you want to bet on? Playing cards. -How handsome are they. -How handsome are they. Do you think they're siblings? Looks like it. Look. 500,000 chips for everyone. I'll deal the cards. Two Pair! Straight flush! Thanks! Quads! -Thanks! -Could he be cheating? Thanks. Let's play again. You're awesome. You won so much. Do I get a share of it? Yes, take them. Mr. Tat, what's wrong? What's the matter? Show your hand. I swore never to let anyone say "show your hand" to my face. Have you finished rubbing? You won't make a second one by rubbing it. -I'll call. -Hold it. Let's take a look first. You're sweating. I know. Wipe it for me. Thanks. No! Boss shouted. Call the police. What's the matter? -Nothing! -Nothing! I'm stuck all of a sudden. You're the disciple of the God of Gamblers. You create one. It doesn't work every time. But I've got something more powerful. Let me take a good look. Take a good look. All right. I'll call. Call? I have a higher value! Fine! I'll fold. We surrender and lose a half. All right? -A half? Sure. -What? You want me to lose a half before looking at the cards? -It's yours. -Surrender and lose a half? -There's no such rule in the Mainland. -There isn't? You're crazy. This isn't the Mainland. This is Hong Kong! It's our rule here to surrender and lose a half, right? Yes. This half is yours. -This half is mine. -It's just a small loss. -I'll return some to you. -Shuffle the cards. -Next game. -I've got some important things to do. -I'll go with you. -What's up? Hey! You can't just leave. Go for another round! That's right. One more round! This is the last round, then. You're so lucky today. What do you think? You make the call. Got it. I won't waste others' time. All in! I call. All right. I call. I call. Nice. Brilliant. Great! You've got the guts. Deal them all, then. What now? You rub the card each time. What a nuisance! Do what you just did. -Let me take a good look. -You should! What a strange rule to surrender and lose a half. That's right. Isn't it? Yes, it's the rule here to surrender and lose a half. I surrender, but I'll lose only a half. -All right, then. -Surrender again? I won't surrender. There won't be such a coincidence. It's just a few million dollars. I can afford it. Open the cards. Don't hide around. -Sir! -What is it? You're so handsome. Make it easy for others by just losing a half. I don't want to. So what? Hey, are you crazy? That's right. I'm Crazy Biu! Open his cards! Don't move! -The cops are here! -Hurry! Don't move! Don't move! What is it, sir? I suspect you're involved in illegal gambling. -Illegal gambling? Just mahjong. -Illegal gambling? Just mahjong. One set of mahjong for so many people? Hey, what are you doing? Sir, I have a cold. It's so cold. Sir, some cards are missing. -Any money? -No. -Awesome! -Awesome! -Kid! -Awesome! I have three jacks and your card is missing. I will take it that you have just a pair of aces. -Take a look. -What is that? Ace! Three aces! What are you doing? I could feel that all my special power is gone. How come? My uncle broke the rules and got me into trouble. Damn. There's a press conference tomorrow. I can't help you if we need to gamble. It's fine. I can manage. Let's go. Why are you feeling drowsy all of a sudden? It's just my special power... Because he has lost all his special power. What do you want? I've hired a special power master from China to deal with Saint of Gamblers. He said if you break the rules and you spend the money you win, the special power will all be gone. I trapped you and your nephew on purpose. Damn you! Hussein, don't kill anybody here. I really like you. I won't put you in harm's way. Black Panther, take him away. I've done everything that you asked me to. Return the debt agreement. So easily? Your principal and interest add up to over two million dollars. Do you think you are worth two million because you resemble Yi Mong? So, you're going back on your words? I'm not. But I just want to get some interest. Get the bathtub ready for me. Get lost! Drop the pretenses! I always get the women that I want. Shameless! I'm not interested in disobedient women. Eat shit! Those punches settle my scores with you for the things you've done for me. Return two million dollars in one week's time. Unless you board the God of Gamblers and play with me for three days. Think it over. I thank the journalists for your presence here. My master, the God of Gamblers, asked me to name this ship after him. The purpose is to save the poor in the world. But in order not to contravene the law in Hong Kong, we'll sail the ship into the international waters. The hundreds of guests that we have invited with all our sincerity will get to enjoy a day's cruise before returning to Hong Kong. All revenue gained from this trip will be used for charity purposes. Now, I'll unveil the statue of the God of Gamblers. The one before you isn't the Knight of gamblers. I'm the real Knight of Gamblers. Sir, you keep kicking up a stink. There's a limit to my patience. You said you're a disciple of the God of Gamblers. All right. Do you know where he is? Can you get in touch with him? He's traveling around the world, and we couldn't get in touch with him. You're lying. The God of Gamblers has been staying in Brazil. Look over here. I can contact him directly in the presence of all of you. And we'll see who's the real Knight of Gamblers. Sure, I'm not afraid since I'm the real one. Arrange a long-distance call before the statue. He easily agreed to it. Watch out for his tricks. But to determine who's the real one, it's best to do it over a game. The real Knight of Gamblers will surely win. Do you dare to do it? Please. What do you want to drink? Don't waste time. Let's start. Fine. Start the computer analysis procedure. Yes! According to computer analysis, 33 percent, a five, 34 percent, a seven, 15 percent a king, and 18 percent a jack. Not enough data to analyze that card at the moment. One hundred thousand dollars. All right. I'll call. Anesthetize him. Based on computer analysis, 65 percent, a seven, and 35 percent a jack. Either a seven or a jack. You've got a damn straight. One dollar for that. Since you said mine is a straight... I'll show your hand. So confident? Are you scared of me? We bet on money in this game. Yours is a straight. I can't beat you with these two pairs. But I love asking for trouble. I'll call. Open your cards. Yours isn't a straight. Why don't you turn your cards over? Trying to trick me? As if he knows which cards you have. I know. I'm the real disciple of the God of Gamblers. And both of you are swindlers! -You're lying! -Sing! It's impossible. He couldn't have possibly guessed it. There must be some sophisticated supervisory devices here. Is the phone ready? I know you won't give up. Let's see how you're going to contact him. -Hello? -Hello. Hello? Hello, is it Knife? Hello? -Hello? -Did anyone answer? Nobody answered. Really? Yesterday, I called my foster brother, Gorbachev. Nobody answered either. Now that we've proved it. You lost in the game and couldn't get the line through. Both of you are shameless swindlers. Scram! But of course, tomorrow, the ship will officially set sail. Both of you can come here and play a few rounds of games. I'm a generous and easygoing guy. Let's go. It's raining heavily. Come inside. -Knife. -No need. It's good to have rain pouring on me. I'll be wide awake and can figure out why we fell into his trap. It wasn't your fault. You were just beaten by the electronic devices. What are you going to do? What can I do? I've lost all the money, and I couldn't contact my master. He's going to win and take off tomorrow. I could only watch him discrediting the name of the God of Gamblers. As long as we have a stake left, we haven't lost. We'll go there tomorrow and play another round. Haven't we embarrassed ourselves enough? And you'll let them play you again? Now, the whole world thinks he's the Knight of Gamblers. He's the disciple of the God of Gamblers. Not me. Don't you get it? The Knight of Gamblers is just a name. I call myself the Saint of Gamblers. So what? I'm poor as ever. You don't know how to gamble if you aren't the Knight of Gamblers? Of course I know. But the whole casino is full of devices. You've got special powers. You could have helped me, but you don't have it now. They're good, but we can have other plans too. -I don't believe the computer can beat us. -Yes, we can beat the computer. We can come up with plans. But we have no money to gamble with. Do you have any? I do. How much? One dollar and twenty-five cents. All right. I failed to find myself a master. And my uncle is in their hands. I don't know what to do. I don't know either! Lung Ng is in their hands too. I can't go to Brazil to find my master. Tell me what I should do. Tell me. Both of you, are you men? What did you say? We, the Kuwaitians, lost our homeland! We're not scared. Look at you. I'm returning to Kuwait tomorrow to fight against President Hussein. I knew you have no guts! Chinese are cowards! Yes, he's right. There are things we have to do. Yes, since we have nothing left now, what do we have to fear? -All right. Let's fight him! -All right. Let's fight him! -No matter how small our efforts are! -No matter how small our efforts are! Let's go! Sorry. It's you? -Knife! -Where's Knife? He knocked me out earlier, and he's gone now. The letter may be for you. Sing, I've figured it out. I've decided to use my real identity as Knife Chan and gamble with Hussein once again. Don't come here since you've lost all your special powers. They are too dangerous. I'm glad to have met you. I'll drink with you if I can come back alive. Take care. What did Knife say? He boarded the ship alone. What brings you here? I heard from Interpol in Singapore that all the dirtiest swindlers have come here to deal with the Knight of Gamblers. When I got back, my brother and Knife were missing. It took me two days to find you. Where's my brother? He and my uncle were taken on the ship. Let's go at once. You've won nearly 200 million dollars in just two hours. We've got almost 200 million dollars after the game started. We're likely to get 400 million dollars today. Those who aren't properly dressed aren't welcome here. What's considered properly dressed? At least, you should put on a tie. I have it. Welcome, Mr. Knife Chan. You've lost a lot yesterday. It's good you could still come today. I just want to go for another round. Sure. I'll play in the charitable function, King of Cards competition. But we bet on at least three million US dollars. It's about 20 million Hong Kong dollars. That's right. I welcome you if you have the money. I don't have it. Well, I can't help you then. Sure you can. How about this? Lend me a ten-dollar chip. -Ten dollars? -Yes. You want to win 20 million dollars by using ten dollars? Seriously? Are you lending it or not? Sure. I'm happy to help. Let's make it 20 dollars. Sorry, my waist hurts. I couldn't bend down. Thanks! Should we get Tai Kwan here? Don't. Let him play first. ONE WINS, ONE STAKES Thanks! BIG Big. Hands off! Open! WINS 150 DOLLARS WITH 1 DOLLAR Nice one! You actually won 150 dollars with 1 dollar. -Pure luck. It's mine. -Brilliant. Green isn't lucky for me. I'll give it to you. Let's play something else. Nobody bets on the banker? All right. I'll bet on him. Great! I'll bet on 1,400 dollars more for a tie. Let me take a look. Based on computer analysis, 55 percent, a two, 38 percent, a queen, and 7 percent a nine. -Look at the cards. -You look at them. The players are great. But it's fine. Same goes for me! The banker gets nine points. A tie. Wait, it's unusual luck. Of course I'll play a few more rounds. For the tie, please. Nice one. Based on computer analysis, 78 percent, an ace, 20 percent, a four, and 2 percent, a ten. Either 9, 2, or 8. Give him a six. Let him win 100 dollars from the banker. All right. Give him a six. Six points for the player. Excuse me. I have a pair of eight. I get six points too. Damn it. My habit is that when I look at cards, I like putting a toothpick on them. And I'lI have what I want. People will think that it's an ace. This is enough for me. I've got over 100,000 dollars. The 100 chip out there will go to you. Son of a bitch! -Where do you think Knife is? -I'm sure he's in the casino. -I'll look for him. -Wait. Whether he's winning or losing, we are unable to help him. The most important thing is to find your brother and my uncle. All right. Let's split up to look for them. This is the only place with guards. Lung Ng and my uncle must be here. Hey! Sing? Mong Lo? Are you Mong Lo or Yi Mong? I'm Mong Lo. Hussein knows that you have a crush on Yi Mong. So, he asked me to disguise as Yi Mong to trick you and your uncle and make you lose your special power. So, it was you. Sorry. Hussein made me do it. Did they hang my uncle up and beat him up? Cut his sinews and pull out his fingernails? Throw salt on his wounds and wash his face with acid? No. Seriously? He made me lose my special power, but they didn't beat him up? How did you do your work? He's a good guy. Hussein is the bad one. He's the foster son of the Beast of Gamblers, Chan Kam-shing. He's here to deal with you and the Knight of Gamblers to avenge his foster dad. Why are you helping them? I owe him money. Well, you should have told me. I owe him more than two million dollars. Well, you should have talked to Knife. And he even wanted to... What did he want? What? -I couldn't bring myself to say it. -What? I'll cut all his sinews and pour honey on his wounds. -I'll put ants on them to bite his wounds. -Don't! He has hired Tai Kwan, a master of special power to deal with you. Too bad. I've lost all my special powers, or I won't be afraid of him. How do you regain it? -How? -I have regained it once. It was when I saw Yi Mong. -Just seeing her is enough? -No. -How? -It requires... -How? -You have to... What is it? Well... I couldn't bring myself to say it. Like this? What do you feel then? I can stand it. They made me wear a tie. A few packets of cigarettes, please. Let go! Help! -You're crazy! Let go! -Sing! -What are you doing? -Help! What's the matter? He's a pervert! Maniac! Lipsticks all over the face! -Go away! -Who is it? -He's crazy. -Little brat. What's up? He's a master. The single-eyed guy? Don't look! He used his special power to make me have illusions. He might be more powerful than me. But don't worry. I've regained all my powers. How? The power of love. Wipe them off. Not yet. I want to smell the scent of the lipstick. -It's 1, 2, 3. Six points, small. -It's 1, 2, 3. Six points, small. You and I know. So is that single-eyed guy. But it's useless. There's a button under the table. A step on the button will make the dices turn. I'll bet all on small. What's the matter? What's the matter? I wonder what's wrong. Why would it be like this? Hey! Why would it be like this? The dices are in pieces. There's not even a single point. That means small. I win, please. Hey, what's wrong? We've won. Leave me alone. -What is it? -Nothing! Let me see. Come on. I hit my nose. -Is it painful? -Very! -Be good. Keep quiet. -All right. Good boy. Something went wrong with the dices. This round is considered null and void. Take back the money and play again. -All right. -All right. The charitable function, King of Cards, will start in five minutes. I guess you couldn't make 25 million out of that 3 million of yours. -Hey! -What is it? We can't let the single-eyed guy use his power in every game. Let's do this. It's good here. I'm betting one million! I'll bet one million in the next game! What a rush you're in! Can you stand it? Excuse me. Hot water! -What a rush you're in! -That's right. Time is running out. Please bet them all for me. Thanks! We don't accept cigarettes. -It's just cigarettes for cigarettes. -You can't do that! No? Sorry. Awesome. Place 1.3 million dollars on the banker again. The player gets seven points. He won by one point. I haven't discredited my master. It's 18 points for the banker. The banker wins. You looked so bitchy when you were posing as a woman. Mr. Hussein! Sorry, I have won 25 million dollars. I think I can join the King of Cards. Anyone with three million US dollars can join. Look up there! What a big earwax! Terrific! Come on. -What's up? -You can't go in. -You can't go in. -Why not? You're scared I'll reveal his identity? -Go away! -You can't go in. Leave. -Leave. -He's my friend -Who are you? -I'm a friend of your boss. -You know my boss? -Your boss is my friend. -Are you clear? -My boss... You... Clear? Don't reveal his identity yet. We need to defeat Hussein properly. -Where's Lung Kau? -She just saved Mr. Tat. -She's now saving Lung Ng. -Good! You want to see it? Got it. You make the call! -Three million dollars. -You're showing hand in the first game? I don't think you've got a greater card. I can't let you scare me in the first game. I'll call. I'll play along with you. Let's side bet two million dollars. I'll raise five million dollars. I'm lucky. If it falls in your hand, I'll be screwed. Hit him too. Open your cards. I have three nines. Sorry. It's a Flush! You showed hand with just your ace and king? You've never thought I could win against you, right? Any pair I get is greater than yours. It could be a straight flush. I'd rather quit than not showing hand. -Sure win! -Sure win! Won already? -We're rich now! -I want a new pair of sports shoes! Sure win! It's too dull to have only two players. -Tai Kwan. -Yes? -Take the money and join the game. -Sure. Looks like both of us have to play together. We're counting on you. -I want to be in the cheering team. -No way. That single-eyed guy is our only obstacle. If he loses his special power and you have yours, -we'll win for sure. -You're right. Any idea? -All right. Over here. Like that. -All right. Wow. I get to make the call. Let's take 300 dollars and play with it. Three million dollars. I'll call. -I'll call. -You've got the guts. How is it? No problem. I'll let you make the call. Seven million dollars. Show your hand. I'll call! -I'll call! -I'll call! I think they've got no money left. I have 20 million dollars here. I guess you have roughly the same. How about this? Let's make a side bet for this round. All right, 20 million dollars. Open the cards if you're ready. Three fives. You can't beat me. You don't have to say it in front of them even if you have a crush on me. What about this game? You son of... I'll see how you're going to beat me. Can I beat a full house with a flush? You want to beat my full house with your flush? Only if your dad becomes a Caucasian. What about a flush with a straight? Straight flush! Not only my dad can become a Caucasian, he can be your mom too! That's why your eye is that queer! Why would it be like this? I've rubbed away your card. Don't move! I knew you could take my card away. So, I've changed mine with Sing beforehand. You merely swapped away Sing's card, the king. You two sons of a bitch! -You swore before your power diffuses! -You swore before your power diffuses! This time, it's his turn to lose his special powers! Shut up. Tai Kwan, where are you going? I've lost all my special powers! Should I still stay to embarrass myself? Ladies and gentlemen, please leave us alone for a moment. We have some personal matters to settle. Wait for me! Wait for me! He's losing his mind. You're a shameless, superficial shit! You teach evil to our youth and corrupt our social values. Good thing I'm only in my 20s. I'm not afraid of you. Hussein, you've got worse manners than your foster dad. That's right. But I'm smarter than him. He started murdering before reaching the international waters. -Are we in the international waters yet? -We're already in it! Now, I've got a good excuse to kill. Kill him! -Snakes! -Snakes! It's just an illusion! Pick up the guns! Hang in there! Kau, I'll cover you. Save Knife. Damn. One bullet left. Stand there! Into the men's room! Let's go! -Don't go! -Hey, don't pull it! Aren't you tired? I am. But I have no choice. Crazy! Don't think that I really got no choice! We're even now. Don't move! You think you can do anything just because you're holding the gun? -You'll be sent to jail if you kill me. -You taught me this. The government has no right to arrest me if I kill in the international waters. Only the registered country of this ship can arrest me. You're a good guy. Please let me go! You're scared now? Tell the others who's the Knight of Gamblers! Ladies and gentlemen. I'm the villain who set this Knight of Gamblers up! I'm shameless. I'm fake! He's the Knight of Gamblers, the true disciple of the God of Gamblers. I cheated all of you on purpose. It has nothing to do with him! What about the money that Mong Lo owes you? She doesn't have to pay me back. Are we the kind of guys who won't pay the money back? You can pay me if you want to. I'll pay for you. Take it. What? One dollar and twenty-five cents? So, you don't have to kill me now? All six bullets in the pistol have all been fired. I couldn't kill you even if I wanted to. -Knife, are you all right? -Lung Ng, are you all right? I'm fine. Lung Kau, call the police once the ship berthed. Arrest Hussein. Watch out! He's so cunning! Beat him up! -Got it! -Got it! Hey. Hey. -Long time no see. -Long time no see. Don't misunderstand. The cops are afraid that some of Hussein's men are still at large. So, they asked me to protect him. Can't you say that a bit later and let me indulge in myself? Hey, hold on! I have some business to discuss with you. Come over here. -Really? -Yes. -Hey. -What is it? The money you win using your special power -can't be spent. -Yes. -The money I win must be used on the poor. -Correct. How about losing the money you win using the power to me? I see. I lose and let you win. Then, you'll be rich, and I'll be poor. -And you use your money to help me out. -Yes. -Your money will be mine, then. -My money will be yours. -And we'll be rich! -Says who? -Shut up! -Shut up! My god! -Master! -Master!
