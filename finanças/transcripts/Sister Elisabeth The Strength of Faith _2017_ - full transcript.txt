People remember the bicycle. It's the image that lingers when they are asked about Sister Elisabeth Manhertz. It's the snapshot they pull from their memories as they tell you about the character of an extraordinary woman. They remember her willpower and conviction. Her indomitable spirit and the way she wielded it. Her intelligence. Her focus. They remember the faith of the woman on the bicycle. They tell stories filled with awe and wonder about a woman who had taken a vow of poverty as a young girl. Who maintained that vow while building an organization that spanned continents, delivering on its mission to provide dignity and security for the elderly in need. It was never about the buildings, she would tell people. It was always about the people who lived in them. They would come to her. They would find her and tell her about their needs and their problems and somehow she always found a way to help them. Some will talk about the forces that lined up against her at so many points in her life, threatening to undo her good works. They remember a woman who, against all odds, always found a way to keep a promise she made to herself and God as a young girl. To build something good. And somehow throughout all the stories, the image that endures, that keeps recurring, is a snapshot memory of a tiny woman on a bicycle always on her way to something. At its base, a charity. The Saint Elizabeth Home Society, named after the famous Hungarian Queen who gave up her life as royalty to serve the poor and sick. It began as a single retirement residence that was home for a handful of elderly immigrants. Something built on a prayer, with a miraculous gift from a virtual stranger. At its height, a 100 million dollars worth of properties and buildings in Canada and Europe. It was a charitable empire that grew so large that the forces of greed targeted it, and almost destroyed it, as they fought to seize control of it from the aging nun. The fate of it all came down to a courtroom, and an inquest, on a single day, when the lies of the greedy were balanced against the truths of a few. The road to Elisabeth Manhertz's destiny began in the town of Pilisvörösvár, Hungary, in 1918 in the dying days of the First World War. She was the youngest of six children born to Steven Manhertz and his wife Katherine, owners of a modest family-run soda-water bottling company. Elisabeth's early years were largely uneventful and unremarkable. It wasn't until 1935 that the strength and determination that defined so much of her life began to show through. I was just a girl with a head full of the things that young girls think about. I didn't have great plans or big goals. I knew only about the life my mother and father had always told me I would have. I would get married and raise a family of my own somewhere nearby in our little town. Then, my father got sick. - If we cannot make the next payment on the land, we will lose it. We must have the money from the soda water sales. - I can do it. - Ah, you are only a child. - I'm 17. I'm not a child. Trust me. And who else can do it? - I guess I have no choice. I was so happy I could help my father. I was confident in myself and my plan to sell more water than ever before. I set off right away. I thought that if I could get all the restaurant owners to buy their soda water only from me, the family business would not only continue, but grow. - I'm sorry to hear about your father. I'll buy my water somewhere else. - No, no, I'm running the business for now. I'll make sure you get your orders. Can you please promise to buy only from me? Please? - Well, okay, but you make sure that you get my water. - Promise? Only from me? - Yes, I promise. - Hello. I know I asked you this before but would you please only buy those bottles from me? Please? Only from me? - My God, you are persistent. Yes, only from you. Now, be gone, before I change my mind. - Thank you. My plan was working too well. Now I needed more bottles than we had. That meant I had to take some risks. - You bought all the soda bottles in town? How could you? I'll lose my land. Land is more important than bottles. Why did I trust you? - Father, rest now. I told you to trust me. Things did not always go smoothly. Some of the restaurant owners did not keep to our deal. But I soon took care of those problems. - You promised to buy from me only! And now I find out that you also bought from Tibor also? - Only a few bottles. - You broke your promise. You cannot be trusted. I will tell everyone at school. - Okay, okay. I'll only buy from you from now on. - Not good enough. Pay me the amount for those other bottles. Why should I lose because you're a liar? - Okay, okay, okay, I'll pay you. But not a word at school though. You are a very hard young girl, aren't you, Elisabeth? - No. But I know what is right and what I need to do. - She convinced all the restaurant owners to buy only from her. And then she bought all of our unused bottles at a discount. We had to sell because we had no business. We had no business at all over the holiday week. - My fellow merchants, I am sorry for my daughter's actions. I did not know. Matters will go back to normal now and we will sell you back your bottles. Please excuse my daughter. - Thank you. - Father, you said I lost your land. This will pay it in full and even buy you more. And at that point, I knew that I could do some great things in my life. The work young Elisabeth did for her father set a pattern repeated throughout her life. She focused on problems and found solutions, even if those solutions challenged authority and upset those who clung to the old ways. A local priest, becoming acquainted with this bright young woman, suggested that she attend a weekend retreat at a convent in the region. It would be a time, he said, for rest and reflection. The Order was a teaching Order and she would enjoy the company of the many children and young girls in attendance. For Elisabeth, the retreat sounded like nothing more than a perfect break. She accepted the invitation to attend. It was a pivotal moment in her young life. At home, as a woman, despite her success in business, she had no expectation that she would be allowed to continue running the family bottling business. Her future would be the same as all the other girls in Pilisvörösvár; marriage to a young man acceptable to her father, and then a life raising children. At the retreat, she unexpectedly found an alternative that captured her almost from the moment she arrived. In the convent, she found herself in the company of women who treated her with the respect accorded to an equal. And the woman who ran the convent, the Superior General, was someone with whom she could identify. Here was a woman who ran her organization efficiently, supporting her family; the nuns of the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. By the end of the weekend the tiny 17-year-old knew she had found her calling. She would take her vows. I knew it would not be an easy path. My biggest obstacle would be my father and I was right. When I returned home and announced my decision, his response was an overwhelming and unwavering no. At many points in her life, Elisabeth Manhertz faced opposition to her decisions. The strength of her character, even from an early age, forced her way through to doing what she felt was right. - But I know what is right. That was what she did when faced with her father's opposition. She decided to take vows despite his objections. On a day her parents were away she got on her bicycle and pedaled to the convent's door intent to take the critical first step across the threshold and to embrace a life of faith. Her father was furious when he discovered what she had done. So he went to the convent and demanded that the Superior General send her new young novice home. The results were nearly tragic. Back with her family, Elisabeth was bitter and distraught. That caused tremendous friction between her mother and father. Divorce and a breakup of the family became a real possibility. Through her life, Elisabeth was, above all else, a caring woman who fervently wanted to create good for others. When she came to understand what her decision was doing to her family she decided to relent and sacrifice her own interests for the good of her parents. She agreed to live the life her father wanted for her. And at that moment, he finally came to understand the love and the passion that drove his daughter. He gave his permission for her to follow her own path. At the age of 17, Elisabeth became a novice with the Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. And her life course was set. At the time Sister Elisabeth took her vows the forces of what became the Second World War were rapidly gathering strength. The world that the young nun grew up in was being destroyed by rampant nationalism and fascist ideologies. Violence, religious persecution and hatred had spread like a plague across central Europe. Through the late 1930's, Hungary, like all of the other countries of the region, had to come to terms with the rise of the Axis powers. Was it a threat or an opportunity? The Hungarian government didn't hesitate. Hungarian leaders saw alignment with the Germans as a way to achieve a long cherished goal; the return of territories stripped from them at the end of the First World War. That decision had devastating results. The chaos that followed destroyed the fabric of Hungarian society. Slowly, inexorably, violent death, disease and starvation became the norm. For Sister Elisabeth, the war was an unwelcome and horrifying development. It was also the catalyst that caused her to further develop the character and determination she had shown as a young woman. Early in the war she had moved from the convent near her home to another in the Hungarian capital city of Budapest. Here, her talents were understood, appreciated and used. Most of the nuns of the Order preferred the cloistered life within the walls of the convent. Elisabeth was different. The Superior General, recognizing her young noviciates talents, put her in charge of finding needed food and supplies. This is where the intelligence and determination of Sister Elisabeth proved to be of immense value to her fellow sisters. Throughout the war years she went out into the city and built relationships with black marketeers and others in the Hungarian underground. She learned how they operated. She learned how to work with them. She also learned to never accept no for an answer. As she bicycled from place to place through wartime Budapest, she always found a way to quietly, but with certainty, get what she needed. As the war built in intensity, Sister Elisabeth was forced to go out into the countryside to search for food for the convent. On one occasion she gained access to a number of slaughtered pigs, a number in excess of the convent's meager ration. To get the meat back home she rented a railway freight car. Knowing that thievery was commonplace at the time, she decided to travel with the carcasses. Part way through the trip her boxcar was shunted onto a siding and parked. She questioned the stationmaster. He told her that the police were planning to inspect her boxcar's contents. Quickly she off-loaded and hid much of the meat. When the police arrived they questioned her about her cargo. Her response was quick-witted and very effective. She explained that she knew she was slightly over the limit. Perhaps, she asked the police inspectors, might they want a carcass or two? The bribe worked. The police left. Sister Elisabeth reloaded the boxcar with the hidden meat and successfully made her way back to the convent. For much of the war Budapest was insulated from the fighting. That ended in 1944. The Russian army marched in from the east and the Germans arrived from the west. Budapest was no longer behind the lines. Sister Elisabeth's job, finding food and supplies, got even harder. One day during her travels outside of the convent she came across a dead horse killed in the fighting. She saw it as an opportunity that she could not pass up. She butchered it in the street and had it hauled back to the convent. That night, she served the other Sisters the first good meal that they had eaten in quite some time. It was only after they had finished that she told them what the meat was. As happened so often in her life, response to her actions was divided. Some were shocked and angered. Others were in awe of her resourcefulness. In the end everyone relented. They needed food and Sister Elisabeth, in the middle of a war-zone, had found it. In Hungary, the end of the Second World War brought no real relief to the people of Budapest or the nuns in Sister Elisabeth's convent. Because, as the spoils of war were distributed among the victors, the role of Hungarian overlord was given to an even harsher master than the Germans had ever been; Stalinist Russia. At that time the Communists were hungry to exert dominance over all of Eastern Europe. They were equally eager to extract vengeance from the countries, like Hungary, that had fought against them. The Budapest convent had been nearly destroyed in the fighting. It needed to be rebuilt. The only way to accomplish this was to turn to the member of the Order who had the familiarity, the skill and the contacts in the black markets to find the materials and the workers needed to accomplish the reconstruction. So Sister Elisabeth worked the system, at very great risk to her own freedom, to get done what was needed. Foreign currency from anti-communist crusaders in the West was flowing into the country to help private projects like the reconstruction of the convent. The problem was that the official exchange rate was punitive. Sister Elisabeth chose another option. She traded hard currency at black market rates and generated much greater leverage for her project. She also took advantage of her contacts for everything else needed; materials and workers. The Budapest church officials were shocked and, at first, displeased with her work. The new convent was one story taller than what was there before. They confronted Sister Elisabeth with their fears about what they believed must have been a massive over-spend on the budget and were surprised when they were told their assumptions were wrong. Sister Elisabeth's abilities to manage currency, workers and materials meant that the new, larger building was built ahead of schedule and under-budget. In 1949 Hungary became a full Communist state. The new convent Sister Elisabeth had been instrumental in building was seized by the government. The existence of all religious orders was threatened. That included the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The Superior General decided that some of the Sisters would have to leave the country and travel to Canada. It was a way to save the Order. Sister Elisabeth was the most obvious person to undertake the dangerous mission. In her care was put a senior nun, slated to become the Superior General of the Order outside of Hungary. The problem was the border. The government had closed it to all but official travel. As night descends on liberty behind the Iron Curtain, a ring of red tanks blocks the last road to safety. The only possible route was a midnight dash across a heavily guarded and mine-filled no man's land. A dangerous plan. If they were caught, they would be killed. They knew it with certainty. Most people fleeing Hungary at that time tried the direct approach. Many of them died. I was prepared to take that risk if it would save the Order. We left at night, carefully skirting the watchtowers and avoiding the patrols. - There must be another way. Our first attempt failed, but we never lost hope. Another way to get out presented itself. But it was an even more dangerous move. - Your sister, who is my sister in the Order, told me I should talk to you. I am planning to escape across the border and I need you to tell me how to do it. - Are you crazy? Has my sister gone crazy? I can have you shot for this. I'm in charge of the border here and you're coming to me, in my own home. - Well, if anyone would know it would be you. - Stop talking or I'll arrest you. - No you won't. We both know you won't have me killed. But I need to know how to get across. - Even if you get across, all the roads and trains are patrolled. Graz is 50 kilometers away. The Russians will pick you up and shoot you immediately. - One step at a time. I have faith in God. Now, please tell me. - There is one area that has no border patrols, I'm training the guard for it right now. It isn't mined yet. You can cross there but only until Monday. Good luck. Now leave my house. We left the next evening after dark. - Look, the border. I'm worried. It's just too quiet. Father, we have just come across the border from Hungary. We are looking to get to Graz. Can you help us? - But there's no way to get to Graz without being picked up by the Russians. - Yes, there is. I need an ambulance or a truck. Can you get me one? Tuberculosis! Stay away! Tuberculosis, stay away! Tuberculosis! Stay away! The escape from Communist rule was certainly miraculous. Sister Elisabeth, later in life, would always describe it as God's guiding hand. She had faith in the course she believed was set out for her life. And God often intervened when she most needed it. At that time, she certainly believed that it was God who led her through the very real minefields she and her companion faced as they fled oppression and headed for a new life in a far-away and strange country. Throughout her life, Sister Elisabeth had a profound faith in her ability to follow the path that God was laying out for her. Each uncertain step she took and each unexpected turn she faced were accepted and embraced because, to her mind, they took her closer to fulfilling the life mission she had accepted as a teenage girl. She believed that God was caring for her. He would open the doors and show her the way. In 1951, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada was first and foremost a unionized, blue collar steel town. A workforce toiling to fill an endless stream of lake freighters with the girders and beams that were used to build the skyscrapers and buildings in the rest of Canada and the northeastern United States. This was Sister Elisabeth's new home. Her first role in this rough-edged city was similar to the job she had done through the war years in Budapest. She was given work in the central supplies room at the city's Saint Joseph Hospital, an interdenominational healthcare facility run by the Sisters of Saint Joseph Order. Five days a week she placed the orders and received the deliveries. The work was acceptable, but not satisfying. So on the weekends she volunteered her time as a social worker at a local Hungarian parish. It was a place where she found that open door to what would become her life mission. Hamilton, at that time, had a large immigrant community. People, like her, who had fled the oppression of their homeland and were trying to create new lives in a new country. Sister Elisabeth felt a kinship with all of them, but she was particularly attracted to the elderly. Older immigrant men and women who were having a hard time adapting to Canada. These were the people she believed God meant her to care for and she prayed constantly to Him to show her a way to help. One day she got an answer. For a brief period in her early days in Canada, Sister Elisabeth lived at the Saint Augustine Seminary in Toronto. There she had a chance meeting with a humble man who would change her life. His name was Albert Gibbons. He was the seminary's baker. He was a pleasant, unassuming 78-year-old devoted to building a modest life for himself and his wife of 40 years. In one of their early conversations he asked Sister Elisabeth about her aspirations. She told him that she wanted to establish a senior's home for a small number of elderly immigrants. It would be a place they could call home, she explained. A place where people spoke their own language and continued the ways of life they had lived before coming to Canada. Albert Gibbons's response to Sister Elisabeth's vision was unexpected. He told her that when the time came for her to transform her vision into reality, he would give her the money. Years later, as he lay dying, he finally said why he did it. Three days before Sister Elisabeth came into my life, I had a dream. I saw a woman in a white collar. A voice spoke to me and told me to give all my money to the woman who wore that collar to help her fulfill her mission. So when Sister Elisabeth arrived and spoke about her desire to build a senior's home, I knew God told me what I should do. From her earliest days as a young girl in Hungary, Sister Elisabeth showed a strength of character and a level of determination that throughout her life proved to be both her greatest strength and her worst flaw. That duality was clearly visible when she went to the Order's Canadian Superior General with her plan for a senior's home in Hamilton. The idea, as modest as it was, was not in the Order's constitution, she was told. The Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was only mandated with teaching the young. Sister Elisabeth was ordered to put her vision aside. But she refused to back down. Once again, she would not take no for an answer. The argument raged back and forth. The conflict with the Superior General built to the point that she felt she had to expel Sister Elisabeth from the Order. She went so far as to fill out the paperwork necessary and, so she believed, filed it with the overseeing Bishop. Strangely, and inexplicably, the expulsion order was never received. The Bishop, aware of the tensions, stepped in and mediated a settlement. Sister Elisabeth would be allowed to follow her vision while still remaining in the Order. Finally, she thought, there was a clear path ahead of her. In 1956, Sister Elisabeth found an old house and property for sale on John Street across from St. Joseph's Hospital in Hamilton. It was offered for sale for $30,000. She countered with an offer of $20,000 and explained what her plans were for the property. When the sellers accepted, they were surprised to hear that she had no money at all. They gave her a deadline to come back with the cash. Albert Gibbons' tiny Toronto home was worth $16,000 at that time. He put it on the market and sold it. He added his life savings and an additional borrowed $1000 to his gift. Finally, Sister Elisabeth had the $20,000 she needed. She bicycled the 80 kilometers to Toronto to pick up the generous donation and delivered it to the brothers back in Hamilton just in time. And so, that little house on John Street was the first residence owned by the newly formed charity, the Saint Elizabeth Home Society. It was named after the 13th century Hungarian Queen who built a hospital for the sick and the poor and personally attended to the unfortunates there throughout her miraculous life. When the first residents of the small house on John Street moved in, they brought with them a group of family, friends and volunteers willing to contribute a little time and a little money to keep the project going. Jobs that were not filled by volunteers were covered by Sister Elisabeth herself. She was the purchasing manager, the cook, the night nurse in the evenings and the woman who helped the elderly clean and dress in the mornings. She worked tirelessly to expand her tiny senior's residence in Hamilton into something that could accommodate all the elderly who were expressing a desire to come and live under her care. It was tenuous at times, but there was no turning back. So the house on John Street grew. By the end of the first year eight beds had become 16. Two years later it was 60. By 1962 the little house on John Street, with a new addition on the back of the original building, had grown to become a home to more than 100 elderly residents. Albert Gibbons spent the last years of his life in the building his money purchased. His final home was a small apartment Sister Elisabeth had built just for him. As news of her good works spread, farmers from around Hamilton donated food to the impoverished elders. In Hungary during the war, and later during the Soviet Oppression, Sister Elisabeth had learned that opportunities had to be seized when they were presented. And so the thrifty Elisabeth was always happy to take what the farmers could spare. The skills I learned during the war certainly came in handy when it came to running the residence. - Thank you for looking after the residents while I'm gone. Farmer Bakos has an extra cow he's going to give us for meat. I need to pick it up. I'll be back before dinner. What? It's still alive? - Yes. I thought you'd come Monday and I'd call the butcher and he would slaughter it. I can't do it. - Well, I'm here now. So is the cow. My residents will welcome the meat. Do you have some sharp knives? Thank you, Mr. Bakos. I need to get back. No time to wash up. May God bless you. - Let me see your license right now. - Officer, I'm Sister Elisabeth from the, from the Saint Elizabeth Old Age Home in Hamilton. I've just butchered a cow for food and I'm taking it back to the Home now. But I need to get there soon so I can feed the residents. I know I was speeding, but the people will be hungry. Just call the Chief of Police in Hamilton. He will vouch for me. - Dispatch, I need the chief. Well, you're certainly well known. I won't give you a ticket but Sister, please slow down. You do good work. The John Street Home filled a pressing need in Hamilton. Demand for quality senior care was high, so through the 60's there was a constant backlog of applications from prospective residents. Sister Elisabeth recognized that her modest building would never be able to meet the demand. So she expanded. One of the first projects was a complete rebuild on the John Street site. 100 beds were not enough. She needed 200. So reconstruction began. And the now almost 50-year-old nun took on a new job; overseer of a major construction project. It was a battle to get costs down on every project, but I always had my strategies. - The numbers on this estimate are still too high. The job needs to cost less. - Look, it's the cheapest bid you got. - That doesn't mean it's the right price. Let's go over the plans so we both understand each other. - Okay, fine. - For instance, the aggregate base for the foundation. The plan says eight inches, code is only six. I know you will put down four and charge me eight. My cost should be half. - Look, if it says eight, I'll put down eight. - Don't lie to a nun. That number should be half. - I'll lose money then. - Not a lot. And it's for a good cause. Look into your heart. Do you need to take so much profit from the old folks? Can't you give a little to these good works? - But I'll lose too much. My labor alone-- - I'll make sure your men work longer and harder. Trust me. And if you do lose a little, you'll be the better man for it. God will smile on you. - I don't know why I'm agreeing to this. Okay. Yes. - It's not your break, you just took that. Why aren't you working? I pay you to work. - Who the hell are you? You don't tell us what to do. - I'm Sister Elisabeth, I own this project. I pay you to work. - Is there a problem here? - Your crew isn't working. They're paid to work. - They're working. - No, they're not. I can see that. Do you know what you're building? This is an old age home run by a charity, this isn't a business making profits. Every dollar goes to the old and the infirm and you are stealing that dollar by not working. - I don't care what you do or who you are. I'm in the union. You don't tell me what to do. - You should be ashamed of yourselves. This is God's work. I am building a loving, caring community under God, for them. Your parents, grandparents. Would you treat them like this? So ungrateful and selfish? Would you say this to your grandmother if she were standing here? What sort of people are you? - I think we should get back to work. - Come on, guys. Let's get this done. - I have not spoken to a person here who doesn't have incredible things to say about Sister Elisabeth. They talk about her generosity, about her compassion. Her compassion for seniors was apparently incredible. - Anybody who knew her really had a lot of respect for her. She had a vision and nothing was gonna stand in the way. She was a great woman. She was a very kind woman, but she was also a very strong and forceful woman. - We've spoken to contractors who've worked with her. They describe her as a very shrewd businessperson, someone who can drive an incredible bargain. They don't hold that against her. They actually admire that trait. Perhaps at the time they thought, well, we're giving away the farm. And then they would step in after the project was completed and they'd feel good that they did it. - What impressed me about her was that she had vision, she was able to see opportunities, but it's not enough to have a vision and see opportunities, you have to act upon them and she was able to act on it. She acted quickly and that was part of the problem or the conflict with other people, that other people had to think about it and she didn't have to. - You need to be a tough businessperson, and maybe more so if you are a female, particularly given the era. Her business dealings with contractors, she knew what she wanted. She also knew if they were not being honest, and she would check the bills. It didn't take very long for other contractors to know she's gonna be a tough person to deal with. - It was clear to me she was running the show. I thought she was feisty, as well as focused. By feisty, I mean someone who doesn't get pushed around. If she wanted to do something, and she had a reason to do it, it was my impression that it would get done. It would get done as quickly and as efficiently as possible. In the late 1960's the pace of growth quickened, fueled by a massive upsurge in donations. Sister Elisabeth's vision of a modest home for immigrant seniors was rapidly establishing itself as one of the largest and most respected assisted living programs in Canada. As the Charity grew, so did the scope of its efforts. The Charity's first foray into building other old age residences was done close to home. A farmer in the village of Courtland, about 100 kilometres from Hamilton, offered her 85 acres of his land to be used for a new retirement home. On behalf of her original Order, she accepted the gift, donated $300,000 from the Home Society, and then arranged for government support of another quarter of a million dollars so the new home could be built. After that, Sister Elisabeth's vision turned global. Her unique character has often been compared to that of another famous woman of faith. Both India's Mother Theresa and Sister Elisabeth had married their piousness and devotion to iron wills and unrelenting clarity of purpose. She wondered if Mother Theresa could use her help. In 1976, Sister Elisabeth went to Kolkata to meet the older nun. For several days they shared their visions of service. Sister Elisabeth for the elderly, Mother Teresa for the terminally ill. - Sister Elisabeth's vision was to give dignity to the elderly in the last years of their lives. Mother Teresa gave dignity to the last weeks of their lives. The two women took inspiration from each other and then parted company, never to meet again. Sister Elisabeth left a sizeable donation to assist Mother Theresa's good works. At the invitation of the Bishop of Lahore, she traveled to Pakistan and after consulting with him, contributed a substantial sum to the building of a sorely needed old age home. Sister Elisabeth's connection to Hungary was never severed. She now saw an opportunity to do good there. Attending her father's funeral in Hungary, she learned about the terrible state of her homeland's elder-care system. In her home village, Pilisvörösvár, there was nothing like the facilities she had built in Canada. She decided to do something about it. And as happened so often, as her plans progressed, the money she needed for it miraculously appeared. In this case, the funds for the project came from a pair of Hamilton brothers, Frank and Julius Butty. In the early days of the John Street development they had helped Sister Elisabeth by donating their time and skills to various construction projects. At the same time, they were building what eventually became a very successful construction company. Occasionally, in the early years, she would give them short term loans that saved them from financial collapse. They never forgot her trust and support. Many years later, Julius Butty was diagnosed with a terminal illness. He was given six months to live. In his will he ordered that the ownership of a 250 suite apartment building be transferred to the Saint Elizabeth Home Society. Sister Elisabeth sold it and used the proceeds to build not only the new retirement home in Pilisvörösvár, but also another one in Budapest. The Pilisvörösvár St. Elizabeth Home for the Aged is the full expression of what is now known as the Manhertz Principle. The Manhertz Principle is that of a continuum of care, from elder housing to retirement residences to assisted living accommodation, integrated with a full complement of medical services, and all in the same sheltered facility. It seems so logical now, but back then was revolutionary. The main building contains more than 200 residential rooms as well as a chapel, physiotherapy center, and various other facilities. The home also contains the Sister Elisabeth Museum, where personal items and various awards from her life are on public display. The Our Lady of Hungary Residence is home to 104 elderly seniors in a leafy and picturesque section of Budapest. It is run by the Sisters of Our Lady of Hungary, an Order associated with the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Residents here are at least 80 years old and require more than four hours of managed care each day. But Sister Elisabeth's pride and joy, her legacy project, is the massive St. Elizabeth Village on the outskirts of Hamilton. In addition to hundreds of small affordable homes, she built an office building, a church and, closest to her heart, the Saint Elizabeth Villa retirement residence. The Villa is a multi-story retirement home built adjacent to the St. Elizabeth garden homes, which spread across the bucolic 115-acre property. Her vision was that seniors in the Hamilton area would first move into one of the 558 small houses that the Home Society had built. Then, when they became infirm or were no longer able to care for themselves, they would move into the Villa, and yet remain close to their friends and family. The Villa was a retirement residence with medical and other services available on a 24 hour basis. - We have two activity centers, which are two distinct buildings, one of which has an indoor pool. There's also another building that was a former barn, that includes a full wood workshop. As well as gathering space where they have all types of social gatherings, activities, dinners, dances and so on, items like libraries, card playing rooms. One of the beauties of this is that it utilizes nature settings with roughly 12 acres of ponds. All in a natural setting. The first home on John Street was bought with $20,000 and a prayer. That was 1956. 25 years later, the total assets of the Saint Elizabeth Home Society were valued in the tens of millions. The Charity, run by the 75-year-old nun, began to look like a prize to various groups that would benefit from wresting control of some or all of its operations. The first salvo from the interlopers came in 1986. The John Street Home, by then, housed over 200 residents cared for by more than 100 mostly volunteer staff. The Home was praised for the quality of its service and the level of happiness shown by the residents. It was everything Sister Elisabeth had ever wanted to create. It was her family, her community. - On John Street, at that time, we worked hard, we laughed, and we cried. It was one of the best times because we became close with the patients. We got to know the families and I made friends. It was very enjoyable. It was like a family. In Hamilton, and other cities in the Province of Ontario, it was recognized as a premier quality long-term care facility. The problem started when a local union decided that the facility should be staffed with unionized workers instead of volunteers. They argued that their members were better trained and better suited to the work. They also knew that union membership was falling in the area. The addition of the John Street facility would bolster membership and increase their own revenues. The argument went back and forth. Sister Elisabeth refused to back down from her conviction that unionization was wrong for the home. Her vision focused on the creation of a community, under God, in which the volunteers were part of an extended family. The Unions, she believed, saw nothing other than their own people working for no reason other than a paycheck. The union bosses finally quit in frustration. One of them made his displeasure clear with a threat. "Your home" he said menacingly, "will be shut down within a year." Sister Elisabeth thought little of it. What could the union leader possibly do? The answer came a few months later. No one has ever successfully drawn a straight-line connection between the union threat and what happened in the early months of 1987. But the coincidence is too great to ignore. It started with letters of complaint about the John Street Home written by two members one from a local member and the other from a member from a heavily unionized working class city several hundred kilometers away. The letters asked the provincial ministry responsible for oversight of long term care facilities to immediately send an audit team to the John Street facility to conduct a review of the accounts. When they were done, the audit team announced that there seemed to be irregularities. There might be funds unaccounted for, they said. Then, two weeks later, the Ministry moved in with a full inspection team for a complete review of all management and operations. - The government of Hamilton, at that time, they were not helping those who were church affiliated and they wanted to get rid of Sister Elisabeth. But mostly they wanted to unionize everybody who worked there. Immediately, a list of allegations and violations piled up. A single oily rag in the boiler room was cited as a serious fire code violation. A broken exit sign outside the dining hall that had never been noted in previous inspections was written up as a significant non-compliance issue. The list kept going. The Home Society spent thousands of dollars to rectify all of the supposed deficiencies to no avail. After years of flawless inspections, the Ministry decided that the home on John Street was suddenly and inexplicably a major problem and a threat to the health and life of the residents. - I visited grandmother at the John Street premises quite frequently. She appeared happy and comfortable where she was living. We never had a worry that she would be looked after. If my parents and my brother and I felt that my grandmother was not in a place that was properly looking after her my grandmother wouldn't be there. We would simply have removed her. I don't recall any complaints raised by my grandmother. The place always seemed clean. The food seemed good. Everything was just as we hoped it would be. In August of 1987 the Provincial Deputy Minister of Health announced that he was revoking the home's license to operate. The Ministry would take over operations and administration until a suitable replacement for the Saint Elizabeth Home Society could be found. Sister Elisabeth and her team were removed from their home. And shortly thereafter the staff who remained were unionized by the same union that had issued the threat to Sister Elisabeth only one year earlier. Months later, what had been originally investigated by the government auditors as being hundreds of thousands of dollars of unaccounted funds, was discovered to be an improperly signed check worth just $3,441 dollars. Nevertheless, Sister Elisabeth was charged with uttering a forged check. The Bishop and the Order didn't want the bad publicity and they told her that. She was left with little choice but to plead guilty to a charge of signing a check without written authorization. Reluctantly, she complied. The St. Elizabeth Nursing Home was now being run by disinterested bureaucrats. Unfortunately, as is often the case when governments displace community and religious based care givers, the functioning of the facility was degraded and the quality of care reduced. The previously clean and well-run home was rapidly falling to pieces. There was large scale theft of expensive equipment and the needed upkeep was not done. By the end of the government's tenure as administrators of the Home, they grudgingly turned to Sister Elisabeth and asked if she and the St. Elizabeth Home Society would resume management of the facility. She declined the offer in a letter she wrote to the Ministry and to the public at large. With much sadness I announce the end of an era for the Saint Elizabeth Home Society. After 31 years of continuous service in Hamilton we will no longer operate the Saint Elizabeth Nursing Home on John Street. I have asked the Ministry to arrange for the orderly transfer of the nursing home patients to other facilities. Once the transfer of patients has been completed, the building will be refurbished to accommodate other charitable uses. The loss of the John Street home was devastating for Sister Elisabeth. It was also a direct assault on a reputation she had been carefully building since she opened her first home in 1956. It was her reputation for honesty and the belief of her supporters that she was singularly dedicated to the care of the elderly that had allowed her to build what was now a substantial charitable organization. So the damage to her reputation that was connected to the charges at John Street was potentially worse than the loss of the building. Just how much worse, she would soon find out. Behind the scenes, the forces that had destroyed the John Street home were beginning to rally again. Some of it was based on the experience during the problems at John Street. In the previous decades, the local newspaper, The Hamilton Spectator, always printed glowing stories of her good works and her various civic awards. But they now found that good news did not increase newspaper sales as much as a juicy scandal. The chief villain of their stories was always Sister Elisabeth, who was portrayed as a saint in the earlier years, but sold more newspapers as a villain. So, at that time, it turned the John Street fiasco into an almost daily headline. And, in the aftermath, the Spectator never entirely let the story die. The paper's reporters were constantly on the lookout for little issues that would allow them to resurrect the former controversy. As that was happening, they were other, darker forces at work. A number of people who were associated with the charity began to work quietly to have Sister Elisabeth removed from her role as the head of the organization. Often, the argument was that she was too old. She was in her 70's, well past retirement age for most people. She was out of touch. Others could do better. The more relevant issue though, was greed. As Sister Elisabeth approached her 75th birthday, the charity she had built controlled property and buildings on several continents worth well in excess of $50 million. The amount of money moving through the organization, rents, leases and government funds was massive. The conspirators knew that Sister Elisabeth would never retire willingly. The Home Society was her life's work. She still toiled at it every day, working wherever a hand was needed. So they planned and waited for an opportunity to forcibly remove the aging Sister from her job. That opportunity arose in 1994. The fight that followed almost destroyed everything. Sister Elisabeth was convinced that the former chief administrator of the charity was the linchpin in the scheme. He had recently been fired from one of the Hungarian projects for embezzlement, dashing his hopes to eventually succeed her as President of the charity. - He was absolutely humiliated, angry, vengeful, upon finding out that he was being fired. He resolved that he would do a hostile takeover. In Hungary he wrote letters to the town mayor, alleging engineering deficiencies in the building of the Old Age Home in Pilisvörösvár. That didn't work. The mayor was an engineer himself and quickly dismissed the claims. Back in Canada, he wrote several letters to the police, alleging criminal mismanagement of the Canadian operations by Sister Elisabeth. That went nowhere. Finally, it is believed, he and others arranged for another damaging letter to be sent to the Chairman of the Board of the Charity. The letter, from a recently fired and disgruntled ex-Director of Nursing, contained false allegations of dangerous practices in the Saint Elizabeth Villa. Suspiciously, the letter was widely disseminated to various city officials and to the Hamilton Spectator, even before the Chairman presented it to the rest of the Board. The Chairman and another Director of the Board, who were close friends with the recently departed Chief Administrator, declared that the letter was sufficient reason to start an internal investigation. They called for a consultant's review of the Villa's practices. A consultant who was chosen by the Chairman. That report, when it was released, was everything the fired Administrator could have asked for. - I think we have problems and the biggest problem is on page 23. - But none of this is true, these are only allegations. No. No, this can't be. The key finding was the claim that the death rate of Villa residents was unusually high. The death rate, the Consultant concluded, was 41 %. - We must support the Home Society, Sister. The implication is that you are running a death camp here and we cannot have that. - What we are saying is that you and Sister Maria should leave the country. Go back to Hungary right away. It will show them that we are being responsive to the situation. The Board will continue running the Society. You are the focus of this report and we, the Board, will be shown as having done something. The consultant concluded that that the level of care was criminally below acceptable standards. Suddenly, there were echoes of the closure of the John Street home. With Sister Elisabeth gone, the remaining directors along with the fired Administrator, would be in charge of the charity. - Sister, I'd like a word before you go. - How can she say this? No one is dying because of me. Why is the Board sending me away? - I suggest getting a new lawyer, Sister. I have someone in mind. He is a fighter and I think you need a fighter now. - I didn't do anything wrong. Why go with that sort of a lawyer? Or any lawyer? - Sister, you must defend yourself and the Home and the people who are in the home and the Charity. This is bigger than you. We need all the help we can get to stop this proceeding. Get the lawyer. The Regional Coroner did what she was required to do. She called for an inquest into the allegations of the unusually high death rate. The Coroner's inquest could result in the closure of the Saint Elizabeth Villa and removal of Sister Elisabeth from the Home Society. With her gone, the remaining Directors and the fired Administrator would be in a position to take over the entire Charity. - The reason for my being called in was there was an impending inquest. An inquest is a quasi-judicial tribunal. Instead of having a judge running it, it's run by a doctor-lawyer. It investigates any kind of death, which that office deems to be suspicious. Sister Elisabeth was horrified. She had been taking care of the elderly through her entire adult life. She knew what was normal. She would have known if there was a problem. The Villa residents and their family members were unanimous in their praise of the conditions and care they were receiving. - I can honestly say there was never a moment that I had any doubt. In fact we were very, very happy. My brother, myself, my wife, everybody in the family was very happy that my mother was here because we knew she was being looked after. We knew everybody was making the correct decisions for her. The medical staff was wonderful. I never ever had a concern that she wasn't treated anything but properly. - In a nutshell, her report generally says that even though her investigation could find no real issues, the atmosphere was such that they could have happened. That's grasping at straws. - But the rate of deaths. - Yes, I'm coming to that. First, should you leave the country in shame and dishonor? Why would the Directors even have suggested that? Because of a report? Without defending yourself? At this point in time I simply don't understand that position. - Thank you. - Second, the report is so flawed, amateurish. I don't trust the statistics or the conclusion. I'm going to suggest that we get a real statistician to look at the numbers for the hearing. - Yes, good. - But, and it is a very big but, we live or die based on what that will reveal. Are you prepared for that risk? - I am prepared to fight this to the end. This is not right. - All right. - It was very hurtful to her that people were making allegations about things that would go directly 180 degrees contrary to her life's work, which is the betterment of the lives of elderly people. The Hamilton Spectator finally had the story they wanted and they milked it for all it was worth. Day after day, week after week, they printed stories and accounts of the lead-up to the inquest. Their reporters tracked down city officials and surreptitiously obtained confidential city documents. They printed scurrilous headlines and biased stories that had the whole city talking. They were intent on engineering a scandalous fall from grace for Sister Elisabeth. - The newspaper is making us look like monsters. Killers. You know we will have to leave Canada if the allegations are true. - Yes, Sister, I know. But I pray to the Lord. I cannot think of losing our home and our residents again. I cannot do that again. What will happen to the Society if allegations are true? - The government will come in again, the residents will be forced to move to other homes, the village will suffer, we will be shamed, a new Board will come in and take over our Charity. All my, our, life long work will be destroyed. Pray for all of us, Sister. - This inquest certainly captivated the people in the region so the Spectator reported on it on a daily basis. The headlines would be sensational because they're trying to sell papers. - I would say that the Hamilton Spectator profited and wanted to profit from sensationalizing these stories. In an unbiased reportage, one would expect that there would be balanced stories. In fact, the Hamilton Spectator never printed a positive story about Sister Elisabeth. I had spoken to many of the reporters and I said, well, why can't you just give them a fair shake? Why can't you just report the true facts or all of the facts? And they said, well, we do our best but of course it is the editor that writes the headline and the main headline. And if the story was innocuous, the headline that was put on it was invariably scandalous. - So, where did you get these figures from then? Were they guesses? Did you cook the numbers to arrive at a pre-ordained statistic? Is he here? No, he should be here, he was scheduled for now. I've just told the Coroner-- I think that's him right there. - Ah, Professor. Good news, I hope? - Am I late? Where do I go? - Right this way, they're waiting for you. - I will describe my systematic analysis process, the nature of the data analyzed and the relation of the data to the underlying population in a few minutes. But first and most important my conclusions. - Thank you. There will be questions later. - Firstly, the consultant's methodology was severely flawed, which rendered her conclusions worthless. Secondly, the mortality rate in the Villa is normal. The jury found Sister Elisabeth innocent of any wrongdoing at the Villa. It was the last major challenge to her and the management of the legacy she had built. In the days and months following the inquest, life returned to normal at the Saint Elizabeth Home Society. In the last few years of her life she slowed her pace and finally passed some of her responsibilities to Sister Maria Szucs, her long-time friend and colleague. She did, however, continue to do the one thing she loved most of all. She spent some time every day visiting her charges in the Villa she named after the well-loved Saint Elizabeth of Hungary. Sister Elisabeth Manhertz was presented with the Knight Cross of the Order of Merit by the government of Hungary in the spring of 1997. She has received many other honors from the Governments of Canada and Hungary and from the Catholic Church. The Archbishop of Toronto, G. Emmett Cardinal Carter, praised her lifetime of service when he wrote to her that "we are all grateful to you and we have "all benefited by your dedication, "your intelligent management and your great heart. "I rejoice to be one of those to pay tribute to you." Sister Elisabeth accepted the praises with grace and modesty. The honors she appreciated most were those she received daily from the many people whose lives she had made a little better. In the courtyard of the interdenominational church at the Saint Elizabeth Village there is a bronze statue of a nun with a bicycle. It reminds the residents daily of the remarkable life and work of a remarkable woman. She died October 4, 2010 at the age of 92. - To this day, if I speak long enough about her I could cry, because she was just one beautiful lady that had a real tough go. Whether it was tough or not, when you see her standing here in our square here at the village, standing over her bike, and when you understand her story and how she tried to achieve and strive to help others, you'll understand the Sister was truly a God-given human being to all of us.
