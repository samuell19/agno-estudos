WELL, IF A MULE AND A BOY ARE CAUSING YOU PROBLEMS, WE NEED TO SEPARATE THE MULE AND THE BOY. YOU KNOW, TOMMY, IT'S LIKE THIS. SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T LIKE THEMSELVES, SO IT'S TOUGH FOR THEM TO REALLY LIKE ANYBODY ELSE. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY HE HAS TO BE SO MEAN. SEE, YOU'RE COOL, 'CAUSE YOU DON'T TRY TO BE.
