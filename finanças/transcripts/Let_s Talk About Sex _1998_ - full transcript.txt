[male #1] '’Okay, we'’re rollin'’.'’ '’Your name, please?'’ [female #1] '’Oh, I'’m sorry. I was waiting for you to say action.'’ Uh, hi. My name is Jasmine Hampton and I'’m 26 years old. '’Current occupation?'’ Currently, I'’m employed by the Miami Tribune. I work as a writer, um... I write an advice column. Actually it'’s my advice column. It'’s called "Jysk-Ask-Jazz." '’And what kind of advice do you give?'’ Bad. Well, I don'’t really give bad advice. I'’m really tired of giving advice on pimples, periods and cellulite. You know, I just... that'’s why this opportunity-- Do you have broadcasting or talk show host experience, Justine? Jasmine. Um, no, no. I don'’t professionally, but I-I really do feel very comfortable in front of the camera. Probably, can'’t tell by this interview. But, uh, my friends and I were always messing around with this video camera that my ex-boyfriend bought me. Ironically that'’s how I came with an idea for a talk show called "Girl Talk." Once my friends and I were in the living room and just started videotaping each other. We were talking about the pros and cons of being female in the '’90s, you know and uh, we even started demonstrating sexual skills for each other. It was really very interesting. - I learned a lot. - Yeah, right, okay. Thank you. - You'’re welcome. - Uh, another one. '’That'’s it for now.'’ '’Just leave your demo presentation on the table.'’ [camera clicks] I was-I was under the impression that I was going to be reading my presentation on camera and you were going to video tape it. Not that simple. '’Your presentation has to be an actual demonstration'’ '’of the show you'’re proposing to host.'’ You mean I was supposed to come here with my show already recorded? [door clicks] Hey. Hey. How did it go? It didn'’t. My video presentation was supposed to be an actual presentation on video. Oh.. I told them I'’ll have it by Tuesday but there is no way. Michelle, he was so insensitive. Well, fuck him! You can have it in by Tuesday. No, I can'’t. I can'’t do it by myself. And where will I find all those girls? Uh, okay. Well, firstly, girls always wanna talk about stuff. '’Secondly, you'’re not doing it by yourself.'’ Between the three of us, we can make this happen. You think Lena would be in too? When she gets home from work we'’ll beg her. Come on. I know the perfect place to start. [Jasmine] '’You'’re right. It'’s the perfect place.'’ '’We'’re handing out flyers today hoping that women'’ will come over on Sunday and talk to us about dating and mating in the '’90'’s. - Are you into guys or girls? - Both. I'’m pretty addicted to penetration. Guys make the world go round. '’Men! I love men.'’ - '’Tell you the truth.'’ - '’I love penises and asses.'’ - '’Well, the muscles and stuff.'’ - '’I love their shoulders.'’ - '’What do I do sexually?'’ - '’What wouldn'’t you do?'’ Well, nothing I wouldn'’t feel natural, of course. I love the penis. I love it being inside me. Um, I like it in my mouth. What I like about guys? Um...givin'’ head. A gay friend told me how to do it. Your position'’s gotta be quite right and coming from a queen you better cope. I'’ve learnt that you'’ve just gotta open your mouth a lil'’ bit wider. Take a deep breath and just go for it. But they pee outta that. - '’And who are you?'’ - I'’m Lena. - '’Lena who?'’ - Lena your roommate, duh. Lena, whom you dragged outta the gallery to help you do this. [Jasmine] '’So what'’s your favorite sexual position?'’ Uh-um...bein'’ on top. On my back with one leg up. Being on top'’s pleasurable. Plus, I'’m more into control. I just like.. I don'’t know, good, rough sex. I cannot believe these questions. [ship'’s whistle blows] - '’I like it doggy style.'’ - '’I don'’t like to be the dog.'’ '’One on the knees, bein'’ on the knees.'’ '’Reach between your legs, grab their scrotum.'’ If I want, I'’ll melt you.

When it comes to peach fest, girlfriend just looses it. - Sure. - Oh, please. [Michelle] Like I'’m gonna advice from you on relationships, Lena. At least I don'’t get dogged or dumped every week in my life. First of all, Michelle. Nobody dogs me. And if I get dumped, it'’s '’cause of the cards on the table. If they can'’t deal with my honesty then fuck '’em very much. Lena, the minute you let a guy know that you like him or that you'’re just happy to see him, you gonna get dogged. And that card on the table crap doesn'’t work in today'’s society. Oh, bullshit. Works with the right person. My parents had the perfect marriage, let me tell ya. If my daddy was alive today my parents would still be married...in today'’s society. Well, what worked back then just does not now. [Lena] '’That'’s because guys and girls just don'’t communicate anymore.'’ '’We gotta get rid of all this'’ '’segregated Venus-Mars bullshit.'’ - '’Just come together as one.'’ - Agreed. '’Move as one and think as one and..'’ '’That'’s what it'’s all about.'’ '’You know, it'’s about bonding. Of being together.'’ [Michelle] You mean, bondage? Oh, God. Come on. Why'’d you think Jazz broke off her engagement with Michael? That'’s '’cause she was losing her individuality. That'’s not exactly true, Michelle. [Lena] '’Well, something is off.'’ [Michelle] My point is...Lena. [Lena] '’Bad feng shui.'’ Hey-hey, Lena. What you doing? What you doing? Stop it. The energy is still off in here. [Jasmine] Please. Energy is always off when you'’re confused or high. [Michelle] My point is.. Lena, you live in a fantasy world that does not exist. [Jasmine] '’No offence, Michelle. But your reality isn'’t exactly normal.'’ - '’Yeah.'’ - No, it'’s not. Just having sex with two guys at once. [Michelle] '’Feeds into their competitive nature.'’ - Oh, please. - Keeps them on their toes. Doubles my chances of being well served and pleasantly pleased. '’Actually, you should look into it sometime.'’ No, thanks. I'’m not into waking up with a crowd. [Michelle] Yeah, well. Neither am I. Eternity is from... the moment I come until the moment I hear that front door close. [Michelle] Goodnight, ladies. [doorbell rings] Who'’s that? Who is that? '’It'’s me, Scott.'’ Scott? [Lena] Oh! [both] Booty call. Don'’t you dare? Don'’t you dare. I'’m serious. Hello, beautiful. What'’s up? What'’s up? She'’s mad at me? Scott, it'’s 4'’o clock in the morning. You know? You stop by without calling and...you haven'’t returned calls since the last time you came without calling. I guess you could say I'’m a little pissed. I just came by to apologize for being such an asshole. Thanks. You going to invite me in? No. I gotta get up in a few hours. So, go to sleep. We can talk about it tomorrow over breakfast. You know I'’m going to be serving it to you. In bed. I'’ll even feed you. Come on. I'’ve been going through lotta shit lately. My band just broke up. - Your band broke up? - Yeah. It'’s been a real drag. I'’m sorry. I just really need someone to talk to right now. Okay, but just talk. I'’m serious. [moaning] [moaning continues] [music] So much for talking. '’Nothing like a good doobie.'’ You want some? No, I-I really should let you get some sleep. What, are you kidding? I'’m wide awake. Oh, I feel good. '’Let me cook you breakfast.'’ I'’ll even feed you. I really.. I gotta go. Oh...okay. - Scott. - Yeah? I really...really like you. Maybe we can...go out on a real date sometime, you know. I mean, don'’t get me wrong. Sex is awesome and everything but.. I'’d like to think that we'’re capable of connecting on...another level, you know. So what are you doing tomorrow night? Ha ha. I don'’t know. Why don'’t you tell me? [Michelle] '’Oh, please. I cannot believe you'’ve never faked an orgasm.'’ [Jasmine] '’How do you fake an orgasm?'’ '’No, who are you fooling?'’ [Michelle] '’Him. And who cares anyway?'’ Sometimes it'’s the only way to free yourself from a bad fuck. [Lena] '’Yeah. It'’s the politically correct thing to do.'’ Thank God, Scott takes good care of me. P.C. fucking. No way, honey. When my show gets on air, it'’ll be about real issues females face when it comes to dating and mating in the '’90s. [Lena] Uh, hello. Uh, what do you think faking orgasms is, girl, huh? It'’s a serious issue for females. Bullshit. Look, if the kiss ain'’t right you just keep your legs tight. - You gotta know before you go. - '’Uh-huh?'’ [beatboxing] No, you guys, I'’m serious. Wa-what do you think that the guy gets better the further down your body he travels? - Hello. - Sometimes. - Like I wanna wait. - Ha, ha, ha. By the way, Lena, could you have been any louder last night? - I thought you were dying. - Oh, my God. Yeah. Well, I did. Four times, guys. You came four times last night. Uh-Huh. Yup. - For real? - '’Yeah.'’ Oh, my God. I love when that happens. Thank you. Well, I can'’t believe you even went there with him. He'’s using you for sex. Really? Is that why he'’s taking me out to dinner tonight? Oh, he'’ll take you to dinner, honey. But you'’re still gonna be the dessert. Wait-wait-wait a minute. I thought you'’re interviewing girls with me on the street today after lunch. I am, honey. He'’s taking me out to dinner. I tell you, he'’s using you for sex. You'’re wasting your time. What makes you think she'’s not using him for sex? Oh, Michelle, because she'’s not you. Guys, can we talk about me behind my back? - Sure. Turn around. Ha, ha. - Oh-ho, ha, ha, ha. - Ha, ha, ha. Oh, God. - Ha, ha, ha. Well, Lena wet the bed until she was ten years old. Mom, can we please talk about something else? Thank you. [female #3] '’Jasmine was bed ridden until she was around'’ nine years old. She practically lived in the hospital. One illness after the other. She was so accustomed to being sick. '’When she first started growing breasts'’ she thought those cute little lumps...were cancerous tumors. - '’Ha, ha, ha.'’ - '’Ha, ha, ha.'’ Thank you for sharing that, mom. Maybe we should open the presents. Nonsense. What'’s the rush? [female #3] Jasmine was... she was always beautiful. '’Well, until she cut off all her hair.'’ '’I don'’t understand, for the life of me'’ '’why you cut your hair.'’ It makes you look like one of those, you know sexually confused type of girls. Thank heaven, Michael likes it. No. I like it. Letty, you must meet Michael. He'’s delicious. [Jasmine] '’Michael'’s history.'’ Before Michael came, Jasmine had me worried sick. She was dating guys that couldn'’t even afford to put her on lay away. Ha, ha, ha. May be we should open the presents. It'’s definitely time to open the presents. [Jasmine] '’Stood up by my own mom.'’ Well, thank God, Mother'’s Day only comes once a year, huh? - At least your mom'’s made it. - I'’m sorry, Michelle. - Did you try calling your mom? - No. Why waste the money?

So the talk show is called "Girl Talk" and our categories are likes, dislikes, skills and thrills. But today we'’re just doing dislikes. Do you have any dislikes? Oh...yeah. Okay, great. So I just need you to look right into camera and speak up, okay? Alright. Action. I don'’t understand why we have to cover our chests just because we have tits and guys can'’t control their boners. And "boners". Where did that word come from? [chattering] I don'’t know, you guys. I just hope that maybe someday on a day like today, me and my friends we can go out and have a really nice lunch in a public place...topless.

Thank you. - Brilliant. ♪ Details please ♪ [Jasmine] '’What don'’t you like about guys?'’ Um, I don'’t like guys when they'’re...too aggressive. Okay, I don'’t like it when my boyfriend...lifts the cover and puts it over my head when he farts. That just...eh-h-h! They eat food like they have to cover their plates so they wouldn'’t have to share or something. Like, it'’s really weird. I dislike guys, who yell out nasty and dirty names to you. "Bitches" or "chicks." Hate it when we walk down the street and they call you like, "Hey, baby." You gotta-- [men yelling] - See what I mean? - Right there. Hate it when the toilet seat'’s up. I don'’t like it when guys concentrate on my breasts. I like the attention. They'’re real, they'’re natural and I mean...I love it. I don'’t like arrogant men. - What I don'’t like? - The male ego. They have very big attitudes, especially the lookers. That'’s why I like the dorky ones. - Half of them aren'’t honest. - They cheat by nature. It seems that it'’s very easy for the guy to just go on into another relationship. Like, you know your relationship with him never existed. Don'’t like it when they do this to me. While I'’m giving them head. [Lena] Order me an ice-tea. I gotta pee. [Jasmine] There'’s gotta be a happy medium. Ha, don'’t worry about it. It'’s...just the beginning. - You'’ll get what you need. - I hope so. - You know you will. - You'’ll see. [Michael] Jazz. Michael. - Hi. How you doing? - Good, okay, yeah. Good, good. Can I talk to you for a moment? Yeah, I'’m gonna go and join Lena, in the bathroom. So, um...I don'’t know if you got any of my messages. Actually I, um, I did. I'’ve just been...really busy. No, no need to apologize. It'’s just that you said that we could be friends and it'’s been... it'’s been a month now. - Michael-- - No. You did what you had to do. What can I say? Yeah, well. Enjoy your tea. [Jasmine] '’How do you feel about guys'’ ability to communicate?'’ They suck. I don'’t think they know how to communicate. As adults. More guys nowadays, are learning that in order to have relationships, they have to learn how to communicate. It'’s like I know they feel. But it'’s like, they just don'’t know how to express it. I think they'’d be better off if they didn'’t talk. [Jasmine] '’What are the excuses you'’ve heard guys use'’ '’when it comes to not wearing a condom?'’ "Baby, trust me, it'’s not gonna break." "You think I'’ll get you pregnant?" That'’s not it! Just use a fucking condom. "The condom won'’t fit my penis." I'’ve heard that. I'’ve heard them all. If it don'’t fit, then you have to acquit! That'’s right, sisters. Before he even get'’s it up, you whip it on. It'’s time to stop the madness. I know as many lies as I'’d have heard a brother say nose be growin'’ and everything, they been lying, talking about. "Uh, you know I can'’t wear any condom, baby "'’cause you know, my shit too big. It don'’t fit up in the condom." Ah-uh! [laughing] '’Cause see they even got the Chihuahua condom for you Vienna sausage packing brothers, see? There go.

Did you cum? And what pisses me off, is right after sex and this is dirty but I mean, I can be honest. We'’re all girls here. When they throw you the towel to clean up with. That is the most unromantic thing in the world. Here, baby, take this. [Jasmine] '’I had a lotta fun today. Thanks.'’ - '’Me too.'’ - '’Yeah.'’ Kinda weird running into Michael, huh?

I-I like it from behind. Like it from behind? Me too. Double time. Hard on. Edge of the bed.. - Double time from behind. - Oh, I miss you. I'’m so white. [laughing] [Michelle] '’Lena'’s still sitting out there waiting for him?'’ Yeah, he'’ll show up. Two o'’clock in the morning for another booty call. I told her he'’s just using her to get his shit with. [Lena] Stop talkin'’ about me behind my back. Lena, we were just worried about you. Well, don'’t worry about me, okay? [footsteps] Oh, shit. What is the problem with me? '’Huh?'’ I'’m just so sick of this shit. [sobbing] He could have at least called. Oh! [Lena] I can'’t believe I'’ve been stood up again. I was stood up at a bar one time which was really embarrassing. It'’s kind of humiliating. If they don'’t want you, they should tell you straight up and stick with it. It does something to your ego. I guess you feel like you know, "Oh God, what-what did I do?" Like, you think. I think I give him too much attention. Maybe, that could'’ve been it. Um, maybe, I-I know I didn'’t neglect him. So, I sit on my couch and stare out my window. He never, he never told me why. I had to be the one to call. That'’s a good indication that it'’s probably not the person you wanna spend any time with. I don'’t think she should call him. [female #5] '’If he calls you just for booty calls'’ time to turn off your ringer. It'’s time to pretend you don'’t remember what his name is or who he is. I dealt with it the wrong way. I blocked guys out and thought "All guys are trash, creeps. All guys are dogs." But they'’re not. I think it has to do with self-esteem. You gotta have more confidence in yourself. Um, '’cause confidence just, is so attractive. I'’m so convinced that the reason why girls like to shop is because clothes give us confidence. Just think. You can walk into a party, you can feel like shit. But if you look good, it'’s all good. - It'’s true. - I know. Sick! Our confidence comes from a shopping bag. - Well, better than from a guy. - Alright, Ms. Ball-buster. Well, come on. You know what I mean. There are many girls who need a guy to make them happy. It'’s like they'’re dying for a man to validate their existence. I'’d die before I let someone have that control over my life. It'’s one of the things I liked about Michael. I was always just free to be me. Jazz, why did you really break off the engagement with Michael? Even I thought he was a keeper. Hi, guys. Hey! Can'’t believe I overslept. - Yeah. - Hmm. Oh, I forgot to do laundry today. - How come nobody woke me? - '’Cause we didn'’t want to. You guys are just too good to me. Yeah, we are. Yes, we are. Oh, man! Look at the rug on this guy'’s head. - Oh, God! - What? Let me see. - Look at this, unbelievable. - Oh, ho-ho-ho! This asshole actually thinks it looks real? No. This has gotta be a joke. Oh! - Hey, guys. - Yeah? Thank you. You'’re welcome. - '’You don'’t have anyone?'’ - '’Does this look like I'’m--'’ [Jasmine] '’Lose the chair. Lose the chair. C'’mon, help me.'’ '’The table'’s gotta go.'’ - '’And the table?'’ - Where were the pictures? I took the pictures off. Lose the chair. Come on! - Okay, you better be ready. - I'’m right. Trust me. Oh-h! - Oh! - Shit! Michelle, help me? I can'’t get the shutter open. What are you doing? Well, '’cause you have to turn the camera on before you can record. - The camera is on. Duh! - Duh! [knocking on door] - Oh-h! - Showtime. - You ready? - Showtime. '’Bring them in.'’ - Hi, is this Girl Talk? - Yeah. - I'’m Michelle. Come in. - O-oh, um, what about them? [all cheering] Uh, uh, help! - What'’s goin'’ on? - Oh! Hi. My name is Monica and I have a very special skill I'’d like to share with you today. In order for me to perform this skill, I'’ll need two things. '’A bottle of good spray and any potent guy of your choice.'’ But today, I'’ll be using...Mr. Cucumber. [giggling] You just spray a little bit of this.. [spraying] ...in your throat. Nothing numbs better. Oh, and don'’t worry about the tingling sensation you'’ll feel. You'’ll find the guy likes it too. Okay, watch me carefully. [giggling] Here we go. [retching] Shh! [laughing] That'’s okay. We got the point. Thanks for coming. '’Okay.'’ [moaning] I'’m blowing! I'’m blowing! '’I'’m coming!

Don'’t express the...the pain I'’m feeling because I'’m finally accepting the fact that I don'’t exist in my mother'’s eyes. Knowing that my whole life I'’ve tried to be the perfect daughter and that'’s still not enough. - What are you talking about? - Oh.. You really don'’t get it, do you? All I get is I married your father and he left me alone with two daughters and no future. And now finally I found someone who loves me. Honey, we have children together. Now, you and Morgan never so much as give him a hello when you call. How is that supposed to make him feel? I don'’t give a shit how that makes him feel. He'’s never cared about me. I'’m talking about my relationship with you. - He is a part of me. - Uh, who am I part of? Who'’s Morgan, a part of? Mom, all we have ever done...is love you. And you'’re saying that by accepting our love you'’re afraid that you gonna loose his? Oh, my God, mom. How can you let him control you like that?

I mean, when he leaves the fragrance on your pillow. When he leaves or something. You just gonna snuggle and smell it.

Alright, fellows, run the layups again and I'’ll be right there. - You'’re looking pretty good. - Well, season still early. So what brings you to this neck of the woods. Um, I was-I was just thinking about you and.. I also wanted to just let you know that I'’m sorry if the energy was off...when I ran into you at the cafe-- You know, Jazz, when I ran into you at the cafe the other day it occurred to me that there is just nothing left to say. Nothing more than I can afford to hear anyway. You made a decision on my behalf. And now, I have to do my best to live with it. You take care of yourself, okay? Michael. Michael, wait. I gotta tell you something. - Michael, don'’t ignore me. - Don'’t ignore you? You know, you are yet to say anything that I need to hear. Explain why I spent the last two years of my life with a woman I thought was gonna be my wife. And I don'’t wanna hear any of that bullshit. I don'’t wanna hear any of that bullshit about you and me not being right for each other. Michael, I only suggested that we not get married. You know, Jazz, I don'’t wanna hear it. I just don'’t wanna. You wanted it over. Well, it'’s over. I'’m sick and tired of listening to your unsolicited opinions and your well thought-out decisions and your advice. I don'’t need your advice. I'’m sure don'’t need another mother. I'’m not trying to be your mother-- That'’s your problem, Jazz! You think you'’re everybody'’s mother. Just ask Jazz and she'’ll tell you what'’s right with the world! Fuck you! I don'’t think I'’m everybody'’s mother. As a matter of fact, I'’ll never be anybody'’s mother, Michael.

I just can'’t tell you how sorry I'’m about the whole thing. Really, it'’s okay. It'’s okay. Um, I have to check on some things. Can I show you around? - Yeah. Sure. - Okay. - '’Bye.'’ - Bye. - Mmm. - Mh-mm. - She really did a great job. - Yeah, she'’s great. - She'’s beautiful. - She'’s really great. Well, okay, lovebirds. I guess I'’ll go show myself around. - See ya. - Bye. See ya. - Bye. - Bye, have fun. Fuckin'’ wind. - Scott. - Wassup. What you doin'’ here? My band'’s got a gig here, playing on the weekends. Your band? I thought you guys broke up. Broke up? Oh, yeah. Um.. You never like gold chains. [soft music continues] Hey-hey, so, why-why you leavin'’? '’Cause I don'’t really see any reason to stay. See, Scott. I don'’t wanna hear about your band anymore. I don'’t wanna see your new headshots. I don'’t wanna hear your new music. Fact the truth is I don'’t want anything to do with...people like yourself. Bet you'’ll be wanting this, sooner or later? Oh, I want it, Scott but I just don'’t need it. You know how that goes. [crowd chattering] [music continues] It'’s really nice to.. It'’s really nice to see you again. If I have it my way you'’d be seeing a lot more of me. Maybe I could even take you somewhere and talk to you about all the things your last lover forgot. I think I said touch. Well, if you don'’t mind I'’d like to know how I'’m touching first. ♪ Wo-oo-oo ♪ I don'’t know nothing about you ♪ ♪ But I could be in love ♪ Yes, I could be in love ♪ [reggae music] ♪ People, are you ready for the original rap? ♪ ♪ If you'’re ready just dance and follow me ♪ ♪ Sweet music in all the world ♪ ♪ No time to work No time to stress ♪ ♪ I tell your fullness still not gone yet ♪ ♪ I wouldn'’t mind talking or just romancing ♪ ♪ Like little children one big family ♪ ♪ That'’s how we live ♪ ♪ I like fire Don'’t try to cool me down ♪ ♪ '’Cause I can'’t stop rocking till I see the rising sun ♪ ♪ Don'’t cool me down ♪ ♪ Mr. Dj, don'’t cool me down ♪ ♪ Man, oh, don'’t mind Don'’t cool me down ♪ ♪ Tell the people don'’t cool me down ♪ ♪ Police man, now stroll me down ♪ ♪ Me tell the girl now chill me down ♪ ♪ Me tell a boy now pull me down ♪ ♪ One more time don'’t cool me down ♪ [Jasmine] '’Do you feel like, um, sex is overrated?'’ No. No way. In fact, I was only thinking the other night that orgasm is like a taste from God of what it'’s gonna be like in heaven. And it'’s like every now and then we get this like waft of like amazing feeling and it'’s like when we like we'’ve come back through different life times and where a point where we'’re totally elevating to another level. It'’s like that'’s how it'’s gonna feel like you'’d be...totally in the orgasm state.
