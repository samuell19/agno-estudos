[slow music] - [Lawyer] Your honor, this news comes as a shock and surprise. [slow tragic music] [lawyers talking quietly] - I am very disappointed. Counselors proceed in your seats please. [slow tragic music] This morning, a prison van traveling from Huntsville to Austin was exploded at a truck stop near Roane's Prairie. [audience gasps] Two deputy sheriffs and Mr. Delbert McKitrick were killed. The cause of the explosion is unknown, no suspects have been apprehended. Since Mr. McKitrick was the prosecution's chief witness, the state has no choice but to withdraw all seven charges of murder against the defendant. [audience exclaims] [Lawyer slams table] It is with the deepest and the most profound regret, Mr. Slate that I am obligated to set you free. Now get your despicable butt out of here. [gavel slams] [crowd exclaims] - [screams] You killed my daughter, I want you dead, dead, dead! - Order in this court! [gavel slams] Order in this court, bailiff, remove this man! [people clamor] [man hollers] Get that man out of here! - Stay low, I'll get you out of here, come on. [slow peaceful music] [rooster crows] [eggs fry] [Jack hums] - [Rip] The coffee's thick as 40 weight oil, tastes like it to. - Here look out. - You know I don't eat breakfast. - Now listen to me, son, breakfast is the cornerstone of a man's day, that's what Mama always said. - You ain't my mama, Jack. - I wouldn't take the job if they served dinner afterwards but someone's got to worry about you because you have been abandoned by every woman in your life. - Abandoned. - That's right, abandoned. Jewel's gone to L.A. - With my blessings. - Well, Debbie's run off to El Paso. - For college, kids leave home, Jack. - Well, Rose ain't kin, she's the finest woman you'll ever know and she's up and gone to Del Rio, what the hell's in Del Rio? - Her daddy needs her. - He ain't the only one who needs her. - Family's important. - Ain't nothing more. That's exactly why I'm bunking here. I'm just trying to help fill up some of the empty spots in your life. - Free room and board don't hurt nothing, does it? [Jack chuckles] - That just ain't right. - I was just kidding, Jack. - No, I'm talking about this. Everybody knows that Slate had McKitrick killed so he wouldn't testify. Now Slate's out free as air. - It's a sad story. - It's a story that wouldn't have been written 100 years ago. Justice would have been served. - Yeah, well things change. - That's because too many people are afraid to stand up for what's right. Thank god, there's some of us who ain't afraid and never will be. [powerful music] You want some more potatoes? - [Colonel] Just drive over to Hoffner campaign headquarters, they're - Hell, Colonel, I hate politicians worse than taxes. - [Colonel] So do I, rip but Hoffner's making a big stink. He claims he's had threats against his life. - [Rip] That comes with the territory in politics, don't it? - [Colonel] That's true enough but Chief, Vernan asked us to lend a hand while Hoffner's campaigning in Austin, it makes him feel safe. He could be governor and we're gonna have to take him seriously. - [Announcer] Vote for Bud Hoffner, Texas can ride tall in the saddle again. Vote for Bud Hoffner in the capital as governor. He'll stop the rising crime rate and he'll turn on his [indistinct] and then the [indistinct]. [engine revs] - My friends and fellow Texans, it's been four years now, the governor's been sitting out there in the capital- - Excuse me Mr. Hoffner. - What do you want! Can't you see I'm rehearsing. Get that away from me. [Ben whispers to himself] [Ben clears throat] My friends and fellow Texans. - Pardon me sir. - Not now you idiot! My friends and fellow Texans, it's been four years now, the governor's been, not while I'm rehearsing dialogue. - [Director] Hoffner, we're ready for you on camera now, ready for you please. - All right, all right, don't push me. - [Staff] Okay, here he comes, stepping in. - Who's the idiot that go the 16 hand horse? That's all I need. - [Director] All right, we're ready to roll, please, get ready to slate. We have speed now and slate it. Ready please and action. - My friends and fellow Texans. It's been four years now the governor's been sitting up there- - [Man] What will we do with the horse, John- - [Director] That's all right, it happens all the time. Here we go. - My friends and fellow Texans, it's been four years now, the governor's been sitting up there in the capital. - This is not a commercial about a microphone! Here we go. - My friends and fellow Texans, it's been four years now, the governor's been sitting up there in the capital in his big [stutters] office. - [Director] Stop, stop, stop, that's all right, Mr. Hoffner, it happens, it happens to the best of them. [ominous music] - This is Rip, Colonel, you remember a hired gun from Tyler named Danny Schmits? Wasn't he doing time in Huntsville for attempted murder? - [Colonel] Was, they cut him loose in October, time off for good behavior, why? - Well, he just showed up, I'm gonna go have a look. [ominous music] - It's four years now the governor's been sitting up there in the capital in his big office behind his- - [Director] Okay, ready for another take, now can we please have it quiet on the set? [gun fires] [people holler] - [Man] He's got a gun! [people holler] - [Director] I can't shoot like this, now quiet on the set! All right, action. [ominous music] - Well, now that things are under control, only if it ain't the cavalry, how are you doing, Captain? - What the hell are you doing here? - Lying and by god cheating. - We've been playing dominoes four days running and he ain't lost but two times. - Now that ain't luck and that ain't skill, that's yellow dog cheating. - And that's a damn lie and you know it. You all are just bad losers, I'm a good winner. They even brought the National Guard in here to steal my money. - They're here because we got a belly full of this sidewinder. - Cheating us blind! - I wouldn't do nothing like that, Captain, I'm a man of integrity and certain spiritual inclinations. - Spiritual my butt. - Check his inside pockets. - Why he even stole my diamond-studded money clip. - Oh, horseshoes. - Let's have a look at that belt buckle, Ace. - I'm really disappointed in you, Captain, I thought we were a little closer than that. - Okay, boys game's over, get out of here, go home. - What about our money? - My money, you're both wrong, it's evidence. Not so fast, Rodriguez. Last time around, I told you I never wanted to see you in Texas again. - Hmm-mm. - Well, why am I seeing you? - Because these gentlemen over here brought me all the way up from Mexico to teach them how to play dominoes. As a true son of Texas, how could I refuse? - Just say no. - Next time I will. - Too late. - You gonna arrest me for playing dominoes? - Well, what the hell am I supposed to do with you? You're an escaped felon. - Oh, you cleared me of all that stuff. - And you lied to me. - [Man] You have been selected to uphold the tradition begun 150 years ago in this great state. Then as now the legal system failed the people and the people joined together to uphold law and order to ensure justice was done. What rough beast, it's hour come round at last, slouches towards Bethlehem to be born. The beast is alive again and we must stop its progress. Do you accept this responsibility? - I do. - [Man] This body has found Richard Slate guilty of murder and has sentenced him to death. [patriotic music] - [Announcer] Now back to Mister Radio, the Stanley Aldridge Show. - [Man] Speaking of old Sug Campbell, when I was visiting yesterday with a favorite football coach, Sug came from one of [indistinct]. So, Sug tells me he's got a bunch of young players coming up size 15 feet, shoulders about the size of your motorcycle. God, I hope they can just read numbers good enough to find their locker, just kidding Sug. But hey, if you need a helmet for one of them boys- [rain pours] And in other political news today both candidates for governor were in the capital city looking for votes. Gary Bud Hoffner told the- [ominous music] - Hi. Life's sweet as new corn when you're living ain't it? - What the hell are you doing here? - I'm the angel Gabriel, there's gonna be a new face in hell in about a second here and you ain't gonna be happy about it. [sirens blare] [gun fires] [gun fires] [policeman grunts] - Stay down! - Get down. - Come on get in the back! You two get in the house! - All right, I'm going in! Stop! [gun fires] [gun fires] - It ain't right taking me to Fort Worth, I thought we was friends, I stayed at your house, I know your kids, I thought I was part of the family. [phone rings] - Ranger unit six. - Stand by for Boone. - [Man] Rip, we've got a problem, a big one, a shootout at the Dinemark cottages in Mancheck, a ranger's involved, Jack Parsons. - Has he been shot? - [Man] The report I got says he's been doing the shooting. One dead, one wounded, you get on over there. - [Policeman] Take her away. [ambulance sirens blare] [people chattering] - You know I don't recall asking for anymore rangers. - I don't recall needing an invitation. - Is that right? Well, I don't need the aggravation. I've already got one dead and another deputy with a bullet hole in his lung, both compliments of Jack Parsons. - Who's the body? - Richard Slate, been free about 48 hours before Parson's found him and put a bullet hole in the back of his head. Is that frontier justice ranger style? - There ain't been a ranger born that'd shoot a man from behind. - I saw Parson's run out, there wasn't anyone else in there. - You see him pull the trigger? - I heard the shot close enough. - This ain't horseshoes. - Captain, this is a nice, clean hole going in there, looks like a nine millimeter to me. - Who the hell are you? - Technical consultant, sir. - Nine millimeter, Parson's wore a 45 and his rifle's been hanging on the wall since his eyes blurred. - Let me tell you fellas something, I don't care what he was carrying or where his rifle was hung, I saw him, I'm gonna find him. - All right, let's go, excuse me. - Where's your cuffs? - I got sensitive skin, Captain, I really do, but I love the scene of the crime, don't you? That's Ricky Slate over there, spent some time together in Huntsville. Why are you taking me back to Hanson? You're gonna hate yourself when you do. Can we talk? - Talking's exactly the last chance you've got, Ace. You tell me everything you know about Slate, I might not turn you over to Hanson. Might even give you back some of your domino winnings. You try to run, even a step, I'll shoot you myself. - He was born in Falfurrias, Texas, 1957, 58, I believe it was. We spent a lot of time together in prison, got to know him pretty well, you know. I think he was a Capricorn, I'm not sure, but I'm sure I have it written down somewhere and I'll be glad to look it up for you as quick as we get somewhere. [intriguing music] Boy, this is a big old empty house without the girls, I bet you get lonesome. - There's worse things than being alone. - True story, have to put up with a lot of small talk, people in your ear are all the time bugging you. Bothers me worse than anything, somebody right up in your face when you- I've heard too, though that man's made bigger by a positive female presence, have you ever heard that? - Dr. Ruth, give it a rest. - The press is gonna have a field day when they hear about that Slate story, also I can see it now, accused murderer shot dead by revenge-crazed Texas Ranger. I knew that guy was a psycho the minute I saw him. He's loonier than a coyote in heat. - Jack Parsons ain't crazy. - He's wily, too, he offed that guy with a nine millimeter just to cover his tracks. - He didn't kill anyone. - [Rodriguez] Captain, the sheriff saw him coming out of the building, you think he was just passing through the area? - Listen, if I want anymore crap out of you today, I'll squeeze your head. - Excuse me, I knocked at the front door but there wasn't an answer, so I came around back. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. I'm Susan Davis. - Oh, hi, I'm Billy Roy Barker, nice to meet you. This is Captain Elvin Cecil Metcalf, the gentleman that just said he's gonna kill me. - Captain Metcalf, I'm with the FBI, Boston office, temporarily assigned to San Antonio to handle the Slate case. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Jack Parsons if I could. I happen to understand that you and Parsons are friends. - You do, huh? - Captain, everyone is convinced that Parsons killed Slate. The police, the papers, my colleagues. Now based on what we have, I'm not convinced that he did or didn't. I'm just looking for the truth, that's all. - The truth is he didn't kill Slate. - Then maybe he knows who did and if so he could be in great danger out there. We can offer government protection for him. Look, you want what's right and so do I. - It takes him awhile to warm up. - I'll tell you one thing, Captain, getting busted by a cop like that could be a spiritual experience. - I ain't planning on getting busted. - Well, I wouldn't be too hasty. A little of that might take some of the thorns out of your cactus. - Rooms are eight dollars a night, sheets 50 cents, towels a quarter. You make your own bed and no women on Sunday. - Don't need a room, I'm looking for Jack Parsons. - No Parsons here, you might check the Metropolitan Baptist Church. [man laughs] - Mother of grace, is that safe a Harin Hall, Marvin. - Nothing less. - Built in Dallas, about 65. - Close, but no cupid doll, built in 64. Once held a fortune in Confederate gold. - You mind if I take a closer look. - Feast your eyes, son. She's a grand old baby. Got a triple lot serial number. - No. - Fact. - Hey wait a minute. Now hold on, you can't go up there. Are you hard of hearing? [dramatic music] [Rip knocks] - Jack, it's Rip, open up. What the hell are you doing here? - Parson's is in there, isn't he? Captain Parson, Susan Davis, FBI. [gun fires] [woman screams] [dramatic music] [car engine starts] [tires squeal] A foot or two lower and we'd all be dead. - That was warning. - A warning, you're his friend. - But you ain't. - You said he was living with you, why would he be keeping a room here, friends, family, maybe a woman? - Not likely, Jack ain't the social type. He's only got two friends, Rip and Jack Daniels. - Nobody asked you, prisoner. - You're a prisoner? - Only of life's little whimsies, the and my own foolish heart. - God knows what he's up to. - Hold it, there's one little stone left unturned. - Can't open the safe, it's against company policy. - I'm company policy. - And I'm with the FBI. - I wouldn't open that safe for the ghost of Elvis. And you two ain't even close. - Just relax, darling, I'll be real slow and gentle. - What are you, Jesse James? - Don't talk to a man while he's making love. - You'd have better luck finding a virgin in a whore house than getting into her. [man laughs] [Billy laughs] [man laughs] - It's not luck, it's skill. [dramatic fiddle music] - You can't take that evidence, this is a federal case, the FBI has jurisdiction here. - Not over me. - You're unbelievable, just because you carry a badge and a gun doesn't make you God. This isn't the wild West anymore. - It's still Texas. - May I use your phone? - Give me that. - I bet you don't care that I've seen that brand before. I knew it rang a bell but I couldn't remember where. And all of a sudden there it was. - There it was where? - Uncle Hall's house, a picture, I was nine-years-old, he beat me half to death too, 'cause I saw it. - What was it a picture of? - That's William Matthews Barker, Billy Roy's great granddaddy. He got stretched for stealing a dozen eggs to feed his family. - He was hung for taken eggs? - That and the chicken and the farmer's wife as well. [man laughs] - What's the flag draped on it? - Oh, it's an ad for the bunch that killed him. Regulators, they always left a calling card, so you'd know who to give the credit to. - The Regulators were vigilantes. - Yeah, and a bunch of citizens who made it their civic duty to keep the law and order in east Texas. There wasn't much separating them from the crooks. Some folks finally got mad enough to start shooting them. Called themselves the Moderators, there wasn't a damn thing moderate about them, they started a civil war, lasted till the end of the century, blood flowed like wine and ow [man coughs] it went straight to their head. - Is this a Regulators sign? - Yeah, it is, where'd you get that? - You mind if I borrow this book and this picture? - All right. Did you get that? - Huh? - Right in here. - Oh. You sure you don't wanna ride over to the church? - No, no, Cissy Lane's gonna get me, we're going to pictures later and then the dancing maybe. - Well, don't you overdo it. - Oh, I ain't aiming to overdo it, at my age, I'm just happy to do. [man laughs] [Billy laughs] - Well, you take care of yourself, okay. - Yeah. - I love you, Uncle Hall. - Let's go Ace. - I'll see you soon, be careful. - Bye. - Bye-bye. [slow music] - Family's important, Captain, you oughta remember that. Uncle Hall gave me my first pair of boots, my first drink of whiskey. He was more like a daddy to me than my real daddy really was. Funny how you start out fighting the men in your lives and wind up being just like them. Your daughter tells me that your dad was killed by his father. How'd all that happen? - Jewel talks too much. My granddaddy was a Ranger, caught his son, the sheriff taking money from gamblers. - So, he killed him for breaking the law a little. That's pretty strict. - [Rip] Breaking the law's like getting pregnant, Ace, you can't do it just a little. I guess he got what he earned. - You figure you got what you earned? Listen your father's pretty hard, did you ever forgive him? Holding stuff like that inside it really eats at your heart. - Who are you, Dear Abby? Seven o'clock at my place, don't bother calling Colonel Boone about this, Harvey, thanks. - Parsons had clippings on nine guys and they all had slipped through the cracks of the legal system and walked but not too far. This map shows where they died, all of them murdered but one. Now, Captain, it don't Sherlock Holmes to figure this one out. The line between upholding the law and breaking it is might thin. - If Jack Parsons was guilty of murder, I'd run him down, slip the rope around his neck myself. Go on, get out of here, I'm tired of looking at you. - The truth is blinding light. I'm gonna get my money and go to Mexico. - You go, the money stays. - Captain, I can't go nowhere without money. There's $20,000 in there, I can live like a king in Mexico for two years and you're just running me off 'cause you're afraid I'm right about Parsons. - There's some things I'm afraid of, Ace, but you being right ain't one of them. - Well, we ain't gonna know till we find him, right and I'll bet you every dollar of my domino money in there, that I can find him before the law does. I'd like to be on the chasing side just one time, especially if we can bag one of them Regulators, maybe it'll even up the score for my kin. [upbeat fiddle music] And if you'd wear a Rolex, I'd already be in Mexico. - Hell, this whole damn thing's just a cloud of hot air. Jack Parsons is no criminal. - Of course he's not, he's one of the best we ever had. - Ever will have and we're gonna find him, no one else. We're gonna bring him in and we're gonna make sure he gets his chance to tell his story. - You know I've known Jack Parsons since I was four-years-old. He brought me into the rangers. He's kinda like family to me, Rip. - Me too, Zeke. - Hasn't even called. - He's gonna to cover without a clue. I guess he figures this is his cart to hall. - Can't pull it by himself. - No, but I'm afraid he'll try. [woman knocks] - Hi there, come in. - Hello. - I bet you're looking for Rip. - Yes. I guess I should have phoned first. - Nobody's phones first around here. - You ain't from around here. - You ain't from around here. - I came by to apologize for the other day at the hotel. It wasn't very professional or effective. - Stupid's what it was and dangerous. - I made a very stupid, dangerous mistake and I'm sorry. [slow music] - I can live with that. - Good. - I'd ask you to stay but I got company, business. - That's too bad, I wanted to make my apology official by taking you both out to dinner. I'm dining to taste this Austin barbecue everyone's raving about. - I know a place where the barbecue is better than sex. Come on baby, let's go to Salt Lake.

Parsons' envelope's gone. - Well, I didn't think Jack would come here to steal the TV, did you? - You're dying to make it Jack, aren't you? - Well, if you can smell it, the rotten egg ain't far away. Now there's one man still left on Parson's list that's alive. - And I bet he finds him and I bet he uses him to clear his name. - Or he shows up wearing one of them bandanas. - [Colonel] Rip, my phone keeps ringing, Sheriff Sheaty is on the other end. - That man oughta get a day job. - [Colonel] He thinks you're making this too personal. Letting it cloud your judgment. Maybe even hiding Jack. - Well, he's half right, I am making this personal and I ain't about to stop. - [Colonel] I can't have this, Rip. You keep on, I'll do some stopping, you hear? [dramatic music] - May I help you? - Where's Agent Davis's offices? - Is she expecting you? - No, we're just dropping by. - Well, I'll see if she's available. Before I do, though firearms aren't allowed in the building. - I wore this on my honeymoon, I'm not taking it off for the FBI. [alarm rings] - It's in reception. - Let's go! - Hold it right there. - Hold it. - Looks like the OK Corral, Captain. - It's too bad you ain't Wyatt Earp. - That firearm has to be checked. - The state of Texas made me swear to die before given up this gun. - Relax, everybody, I'll keep an eye on these desperadoes. What do you think you're doing, you can't just come barging in here like this. - I got the idea from you. - [Susan] Touché, so what are you doing here? - I need some help. - What kind? - Well, Jack Parsons ain't gonna let nobody chase him down, so we gotta figure out where he's gonna surface. - There's one guy on the list who's alive, his name is Boltinghouse and Jack's gonna be watching him real close to see who comes after him. I wanna know where he is. - Can't the rangers help you on this one? - I've been asked to stay off it. I'm asking for your help on this, not the FBI's. - Understood, I'm kind of the lone ranger on this one around here myself. Boltinghouse is living in San Marcos, he's been working the night shift at the Central Solvent Warehouse. Been quiet as a mouse for months though. - Some mouse, him and his old lady stole a car, running all over Texas shooting and killing like Bonnie and Clyde. [man knocks] - I'll get it. - Yeah and then some jerk in Waco forgot to read them their rights. - It's the law, Rip. - I worry about that sometimes. - We all do and then we spend the rest of our lives trying to make the law work. Isn't that why you're a ranger? - The neighborhoods going to the dogs, Sheaty's here and he's got a warrant. - Howdy, Ms. Davis. Let's make this as easy as possible, Captain. - Nothing hard about it, you're not putting a foot in my house. - Well, now the search warrant says that I am. - Am I talking with my mouth full? - No but maybe you'd better read my lips, I'm legally authorized to search these premises, [speaks in foreign language]? - Actually, you're not, Sheriff, this warrant is for Sims Lane in Austin, you're in Dripping Springs. I believe you have the wrong house. - Who's side are you on? - Who's side, aren't we all in this together, Sheriff? - Boy, she sure handled him, huh, Captain? - Thanks for the hand. - Happy to lend it. - Keep that up, we'll make you an honorary Texas. - My mom would love that. Her family, the Jackson's settled near Shelbyville in 1820. - East Texas, my great grand-daddy you never did seem like east coast to me. You know I can feel Texas in a person. - Yeah, but I never lived here, the family moved back east in 1900. - It don't matter, once you get Texas in your blood, it's always there. Well, I can see the barometer rising. So, I think I'll check it out. - I can see what he means by getting Texas in your blood. I love it here. - It gets under your skin. - I like being in your house, it feels lived in. - It should, I raised three kids here. - [Susan] Nice family, your wife's very pretty. - She was, I lost Pauline and my boy, Sonny in a car accident a few years back. - I'm sorry. - Me too. I had the girls living here with me till just recently. That helped a lot. And so does time. [slow music] - I never kissed a Texas Ranger before. - Well, I sure never kissed an FBI agent. - This can get under your skin too. - It can be dangerous. - I'm with the bureau, I can handle myself in dangerous situations. - I'm not worried about you. [slow music] There's Boltinghouse. - Midnight, every night at midnight he clocks out, goes to the bar, gets a beer, a bag of Tom's toasted peanuts, goes over to the jukebox and plays "Misery and Gin." Every night it's the same. [dramatic country music] - He's a man of routine. - I got my feel of that in prison. I walk around it every chance. Still there is something nice about the right routine. Something you depend on, like a family and job and a woman. - There ain't nothing you can depend on, Ace, not for sure. - No, I guess there ain't. You miss your wife and son something terrible, don't you? - Terrible don't come close. Don't you ever get tired of that? - Tired of what? - There's Jack. [ominous music] Stay in the car. - Rip, Rip. - I told you to stay put. - There's a couple of buzzards circling around the back. - Come on, they'll be waiting for Jack too. [dramatic music] - Hi. [gun fires] - It's Boltinghouse. - Was Boltinghouse. - Bullet through the head. - That's the same way Slate was killed. - Jack, wait a minute. - You better get. - Damn it Jack wait up. Jack? - Grenade! - Jump! [glass breaks] [men holler] [grenade explodes] [fire rages] [dramatic music] [slow organ music] - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Jack Parsons never could tolerate a lot of talk, so this is gonna be short. He walked tall and he spoke the truth. His life made our lives special and his death blows out a candle that's long shed light on a dark road. We're gonna miss him but we'll never forget him. - Excuse me. Are you all right? - Yeah. - I promise we'll do everything we can to find who killed him. And if there's anything I can do, please call. - Thanks. - You know, I'll tell you that we discovered another body in the ashes. Any idea who that might be, Captain? - Not yet. - You know I'm curious just what the hell you were doing out there at that warehouse. - Halfway expecting you. Seems like every time I turn around lately, you're breathing down my neck. - Yeah, well that's my job, I'm looking for a murderer. Now I've got two more dead and I'm still looking for a murderer. - Well, you do what you have to but stay out of my way or I'll take you out myself. - You know a remark like that doesn't surprise me at all coming from you, Metcalf. Going after sheriffs sort of runs in the family, don't it? - You don't mind if I cut in here, do you, Sheriff? - Colonel Boone. - That was a fine eulogy, Rip, Jack would have really liked it. There's something I'd like to, why don't you take off for about a month or so and go fishing and get all this pain out of your system. - Jack Parsons was the closest thing I had to a father. He's been taken before his time and someone's gonna answer to that to me. - You answer to me, Captain. You're like a lightning rod, you're making things harder on everybody. I'm not gonna allow that, Rip. - I never thought I'd find something more important than being a Texas Ranger. - There is nothing more important than Come on, Maurice, let's go. - I don't know if it means anything or not to you, Captain, but I'd done the same thing as you, of course I'm extremely crazy. Now the same people that killed Parsons are coming after you. I'm going to Mexico and I know it'd be a strange pair to draw to but you're welcome to come along. - I've got my hands full here, Ace. - You know me and Parsons spent a lot of time together and we didn't see eye to eye on a lot of things. [slow music] In fact, we didn't see eye to eye on nothing but we did have a lot in common and he's gone. [Parsons hollers] - Oh, it's hot in there and I know what hell's gonna be like. Hey. - Come on, help me get him out of here. - Not me, I wouldn't touch him, that's blasphemy. - Blasphemy, hell, this is reincarnation, I got blown out from way to Copeland. Rip here thought I should stay dead, that warehouse was like a cinder, there wasn't enough left there for big buzzard bacon. Well, spic and span, where were you when it hit the fan? [Jack laughs] Why, you with that hair, you should have been blown up there like a sky rocket. Well, Rip, I'm ready to go. - Captain, close the lid. - Thanks for pairing me for this old 38, you give me some bullets, I'll be ready to go. - I don't need nothing, you got Parsons, just give me my money and I'm gone. - Neither one of you are going anywhere. - What the hell are you talking about? - The people who want you dead think you're dead, let's keep it that way. - Well, you can't go this alone. - I ain't planning to. Ace here's gonna help me. He'll guard you if it's necessary. - Him, that low life sore rat of a felon. - I wouldn't spend 10 seconds with that crazy man, he'd kill me. - You will if you want your money. Besides Jack never shot a deputy Ranger. - A deputy, you've been pounded nails by your forehead, Rip. - Billy Roy Barker, a deputy Texas Ranger, how does that sound? - Like a cow making flop. I don't even like talking to a skunk like you but the Captain told me I had to tell you everything, so here it goes. You know a guy named Nate Tillman? - Yeah. - Yeah, you were busted there when you were 14, weren't you, juvenile offense. He's a difficult man to get to know but it didn't take me long to get onto him. I sat his around his bar soaking up beers, talking like an old ranger longing for the days of real law and order, I was so convincing I almost believed it myself. Tillman finally asked me if I'd ever heard of the Regulators. I say they was a brave bunch, it was a damn shame they'd ever gone out of business. He smiled. About a month later I got a note inviting me to a get together. The signal was a stuffed armadillo that Tillman put in the front window of his bar. They're real clever folks. I went to three or four of their meetings. - Was it three or was it four? - It was four. I never saw a face, 'cause they had a light in my eyes. Just this big Texas voice talking. I'd heard that voice before. I still can't place it. Finally they gave me an assignment, you're old cellmate, Richard Slate. [Billy snores] But the whole thing was a damn setup. Two men come into that cottage, put a gun to my head, one of them took a nine millimeter killed Slate and then picked up a rifle and then shot that deputy sheriff outside, then they knocked me in the head. I guess they figured when I come stumbling out, the police would shoot me on sight. They're a powerful people. They don't let nobody get in their way, not even a Texas Ranger. But this old ally cat's got a lot more lives left. Hey, wake up! - What the hell you doing, don't be hitting me. - You're on guard, I'm gonna have to shoot you. - Hey man, I'm a deputy. I'm just passing the Whitler Fog Ranch. - [Jack] Good, now their meeting house is a mile past Red Creek Crossing, you can't miss it. [dramatic music] [dramatic percussion music] - We headed to Slaw Tillman's place? - That's right, why? - We're being followed. - Pickup truck, picked us up a couple of miles down the road. Probably one of Sheaty's boys. - Well, I don't wanna drink with him. Pull into the store over there. How you doing? - Fine. - What the!

There was no answer, I kind of. I know you cared about Captain Parsons, I was concerned that, I don't know what actually. - You don't have to worry about me. - I know, it's not you I'm worried about.

I had to time to go get the money and be halfway to Mexico by now. - That sounds like a death wish. - Where you been? - Taking care of business. - What kind of business? None of yours, what'd you find out in there? - That I can still drink for nothing and I saw the armadillo and Zeke Henshaw. - Zeke, what's he doing in there? - I don't know, when he saw me he split. But he seemed to know Tillman. What's that I smell? Smells like Susie's perfume. I've been shot out of the saddle by a Texas Ranger. - Shot out of the saddle, you hardly know her. - Yeah, I must be right. She softened your face, though a little bit I think. Maybe she'll improve that sunny disposition. Okay, you got an ace high, I got a king high, the last card coming, pair of queens. And the dealer gets a pair of kings. A pair of kings check. - Check's in the bank, I bet all. - You bet all, how much is all, one, two, three, four, five, matchsticks and one bottle cap. Call one, two, three, four, five matchsticks and no bottle caps. What do you got? - Read them and weep, queens, a pair of aces. - Wait, wait, wait, that's a nice hand but let's see what Billy Roy has in the hole here. Three of a kind. - You play cards just like you play dominoes. I'm going crazy hanging around here. - You were born crazy, it just stands out in closed quarters. Where are you going? - You gonna stop me? - Not me, Jack, have a nice trip. - You wanted me to go, didn't you? You're up to something. Wait, what are you doing with el fiasco? - I just added a little ketchup. - It don't need none. - It needs something. I really do want you to go, Jack. - I know you do, that's why I'm gonna stay, sit down eat that chili. - I've had chili seven days running. - It's just getting good. Let me tell you something, el fiasco has won the chili cookout in Terlingua three years in a row. There are people who'd die for just a taste of el fiasco. - Well the Constitution gives me the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and all three are violated in just one bite. - That's zippy hog wash, give me some of them bottle caps. Play some more cards. [phone rings] Hey. Yeah, Rip. Yes, sir. Armadillo's in the window, tonight's the night. [dramatic music] [dramatic percussion music] - [Man] We have no society. We have a jungle. The very fabric of society is being- [ominous music] [dramatic music] And we'll protect it at any cost. [indistinct] Every day we read of crimes committed on my people [indistinct] free almost as soon as they've been arrested. Therefore, let's dedicate ourselves to continue our noble efforts as long as the need exists. [dramatic music] [camera snaps] [camera snaps] Thank you and God bless you. [camera snaps] [climactic music] [car engine runs] Without the law and people willing to fight for it, we have no society, we have a jungle. The very fabric of society is being threatened. We must and will protect it at any cost. - The recording's bad but that's him. - At any cost is pretty scary. - You know what's scary, who some of these folks are. Zeke Henshaw, all that hurts my heart. - What about Sheaty? - What the hell's a matter with them, they're lawmen? - Well, some lawmen have been abusing the law ever since they first pinned the badge on their shirt. - Not the good ones. - Don't you think these guys are convinced they're good guys protecting the law like every God-fearing mother-loving - Hold it, I've been talking to Zeke about this, he keeps bringing up the vigilantes. I told him I thought they was nothing but common crooks pretending they ain't. That sorry, low-life son of a pup, he's snitched on me. I'm gonna rip his black heart out. - Yeah, well write if you find work. - You're going with me, come on, skunk. - Deputy skunk. - Sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, yeah, come on in here, there you go, there you go. A whole bunch of lambs here, you kinda like that huh son. - Hi, Zeke, just drop that bag and put your hands on the gate. - Anybody come back from the dead, it'd be you. - Huh, that's right. Turn around. Look who you been running with, boy. How could you betray your friends and your badge? - At least I ain't running with criminals. - That's right, he's a skunk. [punches face] [Zeke grunts] - Careful, Jack, don't kill him. - I ain't gonna kill him, we're just gonna talk. - Here. - That's enough Jack. - Back off, Rip, this is personal. - Beating up Zeke gonna right any of them wrongs? - Give me that. - How'd you find us, Captain? - You weren't at the cabin, I figured you'd be here. [gun fires] [Zeke grunts] [climactic music] [motorcycle revs] - Take these to pathology. - Right away, doctor. - He's out of danger and he's safe. - His danger's just starting, when can I talk to him? - Hour or two. [machines beep] [dramatic music] - Parsons is alive, Metcalf's got him. [ominous music] No! [gun fires] [Zeke grunts] [machine beeps] - You know, I've been thinking. - Well, don't think, don't talk, don't do nothing, just stay out of my way. - You think this damn rig will work? - I try to mind my own business, I suggest you do the same thing. - Well, if it was mine, I'd use 30 weight motor oil, paint that string black. - Of the six plates you gave me, I came up with names on five. They're still working on the other one, something to do with the change in registration. Now if I knew where these came from or why you were interested, maybe I could help. - I think they might have killed Jack Parsons. - Henshaw's a Texas Ranger and Sheaty, are you sure? - No. - What do you think is going on, Rip? - What do you know about the Regulators? [phone rings] - Colonel. - Rip, someone just put three bullets through Zeke Henshaw in the hospital, it's probably the same character that killed Parsons. They'll be coming after you next. - I hear that. - What's even crazier is that the governor thinks- - I brought Zeke Henshaw into the rangers, taught him everything I know, I must have left something out, 'cause he's dead. - Henshaw, Sheaty Tillman, George Lockwood, Billy Lee Brunner. - Billy Lee Brunner, he owns half of Pflugerville, I used to fish with his dad. - Money and power, some heavy hitters. - More rattles, we gotta find the head of the snake. - There's something seriously rotten in the great state of- - Him! That's him, that's the head of the snake, that's the voice! - The governor's office- - I've heard this campaign ad so many times I stopped listening to it. - Nobody pays any attention to campaign ads anyway. - That's right, that's why I couldn't place this voice. - [Man] Without the law and people willing to fight for it. We have no society, we have a jungle. - A little too much- - Right out of the mouth of the snake. - [Announcer] Paid for by the Committee to Elect Bud Hoffner governor. - Come on, let's go get him, I know how to skin a rattlesnake. - Not yet, a tape and a hunch ain't gonna hold up in court. - Well Hoffner and his bunch don't care about courts. - Well, we're not them. That's what this is all about. - Oh, hell, Rip, who put that morality bug in your ear. - You did. - The license plate Susan couldn't find must be Hoffners. That would put him at the farmhouse and then that tape would be worth something. - Susan's working on it. - Well, let's give Susan a hand. - This license plate is part of a classified sequence assigned by the federal government. - What part of the government? - FBI. - It ain't necessarily her, Captain, there must be 10 or 15 agents in Austin alone. - In the middle of the picture, what do you see? - A man who died for no reason. - No that sign. - Shelbyville Liberty, well he's from Nacogdoches, that's not far away. - Susan's family's from Shelbyville. - Uh-oh. The Regulators started in Shelby County. The base operation was Shelbyville. The leader was named Charles W. Jackson. - Jackson's Susan's family name. - Well ain't you slicker than soap on a door knob. Of course she couldn't trace that car, it was hers. - It looks that way. - FBI agent dancing cheek to cheek with Hoffner, using whatever she could to get close to you so she could pick your brain. - You should have known better. - Well, Rip, that's spilled milk, so to speak. Now look here, let me tell you one thing. Hoffner's gonna have this big fundraiser tomorrow. Let's get over there and stick a pistol in his ear and make him sing like Julio Iglesias. [dramatic music] [ominous music] [bottles rattle] - There goes my perimeter tent system. - What? - Beer bottles and bailing wire but it's working. Captain we got bogies. - Sure do, Rip, about maybe five, maybe six, the more the merrier, beats the hell out of "Kojak" reruns, well I got the front, you cover my back, okay. Deputy skunk here will pass the ammunition. - Hell with that, I'm a deputy, throw me a gun. [dramatic music] [glass breaks] - I'm here, come on, come to Uncle Jack, let me give you the hot kiss of death! [gun fires] [glass breaks] Ha, it don't get no better than this, does it, criminal! - [Billy] Yeah, this is a real piece of heaven, Jack! - Ha, I love it. - Who's driving? - You. - Ah-yeah. - Damn! [car crashes] [gun fires] - [Billy] I bet this road was rough before they taped it. - [Jack] Boy you just drive. - What's going on? Rip, what are you doing? Billy Roy, what's going on here guys, come on? Will someone tell me what's going on? - Sit down. - Just say something, anything, what the hell is going on? - Me, for one. - And a couple of other things, I've been reading up on the Regulators, Charles Jackson made quite a name for himself over in Shelbyville. - We traced those license plates you couldn't seem to find. - It isn't what you think it is. - You don't wanna know what I think but I want the truth. - All right, the truth is, I'm working with Hoffner and the FBI. I've been undercover inside Hoffner's group now for three months. No one knows, not even the bureau. - Oh shoot. - I didn't know who I could trust, not even you. I met Hoffner at a fundraiser, somehow the family name came up and he recognized it and started talking about the Regulators. I could tell he was fishing so I nibbled. We stayed in touch and he finally told and invited me to join. He loved the fact that the great-great granddaughter of Charles Jackson was involved. He trusted me, I got close to him fast. Henshaw knew Parsons was undercover. Slate's murder was a set up. - Where were you? - I got word to Sheaty about the set up through an informant. I figured that would protect Slate and Parsons. It was only later that I found out that Sheaty was one of them. And when Parsons got away. - Oh, call me Jack. - When Jack got away, Hoffner was furious. It was everyone's job to find him. - So, you snuggled up to me hoping I'd take you to him? - Yes before they found him. I needed you alive, you're the best witness I've got. - Hell, I ain't had so much fun since the hogs ate my little brother. - That's why I went to the hotel to try to warn Parsons without blowing my cover with Hoffner. - You could have told me. - No I couldn't, I didn't know who was involved. I couldn't take that chance for Jack's sake. I had to protect him. I'm an agent and a good one but I'm a rotten liar when it comes to things that matter to me. And if I was working for them you would have known I was pretending when I was with you. You know I wasn't pretending. Hoffner's the only one that knows everyone involved. He keeps the whole membership list in a 25 cent three by five purple spiral notebook. It has a TCU insignia on the front. He's a big Froggies' fan. - Do you know where it is? - I've seen it several times in his hotel suite. He hides it somewhere in the library. Now how to get it is another question all together. - Well, it's a good thing you all got a criminal like me around. - It's so good to see you, so good to see you. I appreciate that, Sweetie. How are you, how are you? - Mr. And Mrs. R. Johnson, $100,000. - Jobeth, how are you? [people chatter] [violin music] - Okay you all go on, I'll see you later, I'm gonna find a limb to perch on. [people chatter] - What is that? - Crab soufflé on marinated hearts of palm, delicious. - No thank you. What's that? - This is quail egg wrapped in seaweed. - And how's that cooked? - Well, it's not, it's supposed to be raw. - How are you, good to see you. - Looks like Tiffany's Christmas catalog, Captain, I think I'll browse around. - No you won't. - Five minutes. Four minutes. - Forget it. - This is like locking Trevino on a golf course and not letting him play. - What a lovely outfit. [indistinct] - Hoffner's has a suite on the ninth floor, I'll get you in the private elevator, follow me. Here, this will get you into his suite, now use the back entrance, 'cause there's always a guard by the front. Be careful. - Nice dress. [Susan sighs] I'll check out the guard. He's right outside the door. - You know sometimes you gotta let the room tell you what you're looking for. Ego is an amazing thing. It was just one of them old Wrigley's, I don't know why they bothered hiding a piece of tin like this. - He's here. [dramatic music] - Let's go. There it is. - Let's get out of here. [ominous music] - Gun belt, cowboy. - Well now, isn't this a sad site, right now, another Texas Ranger gone bad. Seems like an epidemic lately. - Hmm-mm. - You're smoother than 14-year-old whiskey. - Thank you. - Isn't she, though. Sold you on that idea about being a double agent. And then set you all up to come over here looking for that, just so you could get caught with your fingers in the cookie jar. Law and order is the issue of this campaign gentlemen. You've proven my point. - No, you proved it. - We know all about the Regulators, Boltinghouse and the Slate and the others you had murdered. And we know you killed Zeke Henshaw. - Yes, yes and I'm proud, we're all proud to be the instrument of justice in a lawless time. - You won't be able to hide the truth. - Truth [laughs], who's gonna believe a couple of petty criminals, hmm? - Maybe no one but they might believe a Texas Ranger and FBI agent and you. [gun fires] [man grunts] [climactic music] - Stop him fool! - Watch her. [gun fires] [climactic music] [women scream] - Hey! [people exclaim] - Read this. [women scream] Damn. [climactic music] Break his damn neck. - Hold it, let go! - Excuse me, sir could I have that gun please, thank you. - Thank you, deputy. - You're under arrest. - Well, Rip, it's over. - Not yet. [punches man] [audience exclaims] [glass breaks] [Jack hollers] - [Billy] Nice left. - We got the main honchos, Hoffner and Sheaty. - Yeah, without that notebook, the rest of those crazies stay free. - Let's keep our chin up, we'll get them all. - You all wait a minute. - What in the hell's this? - Susie, you got a lot to learn about women. - Hell all a ranger needs to be happy is a horse with a smooth gait and a gun that don't jam. - Hey that's good, because the thought of you procreating with anybody scares me to death. - It should. - My cowboys. - I'm starving to death, ain't you? - We ate a half an hour ago. Oh yeah. [slow music] - Those are very thoughtful. - It was Billy Roy's idea. - It don't matter. - It don't matter? - It's the Texas in my blood. - It's the drugs. - I've been promoted, supervisory special - It's what you deserve, is it what you want? - It's what I wanted. - Well, give it a try. If it don't work out you could always come back here, get a pickup truck, a pair of boots, see if you're a real Texan. - Yeah. - Where's Jack? - Watching TV over in the waiting room, "The Wild Bunch" is on, said he'd meet you at the house. You okay, Captain? - Susan's being transferred to Pittsburgh. - Well, that invitation to Mexico is still open if you wanna go down there with me, it's a good place to relax. - I'll keep that in mind. Bus station. - Bus station? Bus station, last time you run me out of Texas, I flew, this set a precedent. - Don't get comfortable with it, you ain't coming back. - Well, it's gonna be hard to leave without money. - You earned it this time, Ace. - I earned it the first time. Good-looking money clip, ain't it? Looks even better when it's full of money. Oh, one thing. I slipped that up my sleeve the other night over at Hoffner's, I had a backup that I brought with me. You could at least say thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I need a favor, one more thing that needs taken care of. Cecil Merritt Metcalf, your middle name is Cecil, isn't it? It's a good thing they call you Rip. Of course when it's family you gotta take the good with the bad. - Needs some tending. [slow music] [car starts] - I'll park it in the white zone, Captain with the keys under the mat. [upbeat country music] [Billy laughs] - You're a piece of work, Ace. [slow country music] [whimsical music] [baby laughs]
