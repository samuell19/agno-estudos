[waves splashing] -[camera shutters clicking] -[indistinct chatter] [Dana] Um, we're here today on a motion for relief from judgement filed by Mr. Wershe. As both parties know, the parties are not... [Wershe] Being in prison the last 29 years- is like being dead. [Dana] "Now based on my readings of... [Wershe] The only connection I have to the free world- is this telephone. You see your kids grow up- but you have no part of anything. It's like living in the ultimate purgatory. [Dana] "The case law over the last decade has demanded that we treat juveniles constitutionally different than adults. That difference requires us to consider the defendant's age at the time when crime... " [Wershe] Sitting here in front of the judge- scared as hell- I know this is the best chance of getting my life back. And I know everything rides on what this judge is about to say. Everyone knows who I am- but no one knows the real reason I'm in here. [splatters] [Chris] The teenage drug dealer nicknamed "White Boy Rick," was busted at age 17. And has served 28 years behind bars, the longest ever in Michigan for a non-violent juvenile. [Steve] You're not gonna convince any judge in this day and age that somebody deserves life for selling drugs. How many of you have heard about the drug problem in our schools? The only thing that I legitimately remember about the War on Drugs in the '80s when I was a child, was seeing Nancy Reagan on Diff'rent Strokes, telling, you know, Gary Coleman, "Just say no." All drugs are dumb. [Scott] He was moving kilos. When you're 17 years old and you're moving kilos, you know, you're at a status of drug dealer that most 17-year-olds don't reach. And I'll tell you from what I can see as a judge now, the War on Drugs is over, and drugs won. [Joe] Young Boys Incorporated, originally, was the gang that really institutionalized and industrialized the distribution of heroine. Detroit's heroin market gave way to cocaine which quickly gave way to crack cocaine. [Tom Brokaw] Crack is a plague of the inner cities in this country, and that's been especially true in Detroit. [Kevin] The city, literally, right in front of your eyes was falling apart. It was chaos. And nobody knew how to handle it. This chamber here holds 12 shotgun shells and everything... As part of a five-part series on the crack problem, I went on dozens and dozens and dozens of narcotics raids with the No Crack Task Force. -[policeman #1] Police! -[policeman #2] Get them out! -[clatters] -[shatters] It was crazy. I mean, today, you probably wouldn't get away with that. [Chris] Agents say the gang was well armed. In many of the homes, they found assault weapons. It was very, very violent. We had officers shot, uh, a couple of them killed. And I was right in the middle of it. [Herm] I was on, uh, the drug squad for the FBI. But in the course of some of these raids, they discovered a cache of videotapes. [Chris] And this is one of the drug homes owned by the Chambers Brothers, the notorious drug gang. [gang member #1] Money, money, money! We're rich, goddamn it! A hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Cash. [Chris] They go through the homes. The faucets, 24 karat gold. And this was amazing stuff. [William] Once upon a time, drug dealers was truly idolized. They had all the man toys that they wanted. Cars, planes, housing, weapons. [Gregg] The money was just unlimited. And it becomes a problem because it's a cash business. [gang member #1] Should we throw these ones away, man, since we got $500,000? What do you do with all that cash? [gang member #2] I tell you what we can do, we can give it to the poor. [gang member #1] That's exactly what I said, too, we'll just donate those to the poor. It seemed like every week, a new drug gang emerged. The Chambers Brothers, Best Friends, Young Boys Incorporated, Maserati Rick, Johnny Curry and Leo Curry had started a drug organization. [Johnny] Say, for instance, I got a key of cocaine, and two or three keys of cocaine. You might have a hundred bales of weed. I make more off this cocaine than you do off the weed with less headaches. That's how I got into that game. When we talk about Young Boys Incorporated, or the Chambers Brothers, there's not one single white person involved in any of those gangs. [upbeat music] [Chris] During the coverage of the Chambers Brothers, I had a conversation with a source or sources who said, "You know, there's this kid who's dealing cocaine. Richard Wershe, Jr. He's 17. And he's white, in a largely black-dominated world. And his nickname is "White Boy Rick." [Chris] The teenage drug dealer nicknamed "White Boy Rick." [reporter #2] "White Boy Rick." [reporter #3] "White Boy Rick." [reporter #2] His name is Richard Wershe, Jr. [Joe] One of the things you don't wanna do if you're a criminal, I would advise you never to get a nickname and especially, a really catchy nickname. [Scott] I just remember the name and the face. I recall me and my friends joking around when we were 16, 17 in the suburbs, and someone would be dealing weed out of his car and we joked, "Oh, who do you think you are, White Boy Rick?" [Seth] In the 1990s, when I first entered the federal prison system, you hear about all the different street legends from the different cities. I, I was mainly on the East Coast, but one of the guys, you know, that there was a lot of talk about, was White Boy Rick. And, to me, I was kinda mesmerized, because, you know, being a white drug dealer myself, in the suburbs and in colleges, I was like, "Who was this white kid you know, that was supposedly running all these black gangs and running the city of Detroit?" At that time, I really didn't know anything about White Boy Rick. [Scott] I didn't know who Rick Wershe was. I just knew there was this caricature, almost like a comic book character being splashed across the newspapers all the time. He had to be at least 15, 16 years old when I met him. [Johnny] But he was smart. He was socializing and doing business with the biggest drug dealers in Detroit. We all bought motorcycles together, rolled up to see my brother in prison together. [Scott] It became a very iconic moniker. It has been name-dropped in Kid Rock songs. [Kid Rock] ♪ Got more cash Than White Boy Rick ♪ [Scott] Johnny Curry would buy him a mink coat. They'd walk around with their twin mink coats. To integrate like he did, I mean, that's not... Not everyone can do that. And my point is, he wasn't a poser. That's who he was. He was a product of his environment. He was a white kid that was brought up his... basically, his whole life around all black people. A lot of the DPD that were working in the Detroit drug scene at that time, knew Rick was a race traitor. They did not like the fact that he talked black, that he acted black, that he dated black women, and definitely didn't like 14 to 15-year-old kids rolling around in BMWs, and flashing cash wads that equal more than their entire paycheck for the whole year. Half million a week. Two million dollars a month. [Scott] It bred a lot of resent. -[gunshots] -[police dispatcher] Dispatch 8. There were sections of the city in the mid '80s that were war zones. [reporter #4] This drug operation was so heavily-fortified, that police could not get through the front door. -[police dispatcher] Calling in. -[thuds] -[man #1] Oh! -[man #2] Ooh. [Scott] In Detroit in the 1980s, there were dozens upon dozens of proficient, professional killers. The most menacing, the most feared, was without question, Nate "Boone" Craft. [Nate] In the '80s, I was a hitman that worked for many different drug lords and kingpin. Even some that weren't even in this country. [reporter #5] Law officers say there are direct links now between gangs and Colombian drug dealers. They were hiring me to do hits. [Nate] I was, uh, involved with about 30 murders. I was responsible for almost 30 murders. They paid 50,000 and up. And I was looking to gain. Anything that was 50,000, I'll always will be, "Come on with it. What do you want? The guy's head? You want his arm? You want his private part?" [reporter #6] Rice was in charge of the Detroit Police Department's Homicide Division. Crack cocaine changed the whole complexion of homicide cases in the city of Detroit. We were actually having almost 800 homicides per year. Probably 85% was due in some part to the narcotics trade. Now this is what happens to you when you become a gangster, a hitman, or whatever. You get shot up. Either you didn't pay what you owe me, or jealousy takes over. Leg, tore up. I had to walk with a cane. AK. I can't even move my hands. Shotgun blast. They hit me with everything, nine in the back. I'm like the Grim Reaper. If you make my list, I'm coming for you, whether you're good or bad. White people have left this city in record numbers. It goes from almost two million people, now it's down to a million people. [Ralph] Today, we're probably down to 600,000 people. [Scott] Rick grew up on the east side of Detroit which is, uh, notoriously a very tough, tough area. We were very normal. We were a normal family coming up. My grandparents lived across the street from us. [Dawn] And it was my brother, and my dad and I, and... [Darlene] Rick's father and I divorced when Rick was 5. And they stayed with him at the house which I wasn't happy about. But they wanted to be there, so I left them. [Dawn] It went, you know, from a nice, working class neighborhood regardless of race or color, to just horrible. Like, there was crack houses across the street from our house. My grandmother, I remember her getting robbed for her purse in her own driveway. I mean, it was bad. [Scott] He played Little League Baseball. He was the star of his league baseball team, a pitcher. Eventually, he went out and spent his eighth-grade year out in the suburbs in Macomb County with his mom. He did really well out there. He got good grades, he was popular in the school. But he was seeing his father on occasion, and he decided to go back with him. [Scott] Richard Sr. was a gun dealer... street hustler. And the joke became, you know, that there was White Dad Rick, and White Boy Rick. [Scott] Rick himself, really idolized his father, and spent most of his childhood at his father's side. To the point where he was kinda known in those gun shows when he was 11, 12, 13 years old, as like one of the best salesmen at those gun shows. It was an adventurous life. [Herm] I mean, it was cowboys and Indians in Detroit at that time. And he just got caught up in it. [Se Everything that I knew, you know, that was like the glamorized version of White Boy Rick. But once I started talking to him, and researching the case with all the documents and newspaper articles and court records, I found a very different story emerged. [male ad narrator] One out of every five people who try cocaine get hooked. But that's not your problem. [sniffs] -[children laughing] -[male ad narrator] Or is it? [slams] [Ralph] What the legislators tried to do was make the law so harsh that people would think twice before getting into the drug trade. Now we're gonna pass the statute that provides for mandatory life. [Steve] Anybody who's in possession of over 650 grams of cocaine, they got convicted, they got mandatory life. [Scott] Hundreds of people were prosecuted underneath the 650 Law, including Tim Allen, the actor in Hollywood. Well, historically, penalty has never been a factor in stopping a crime from occurring. As long as there's enough money in the crime, the penalty isn't gonna make a big difference. [Steve] There was a lot of money to be made, and a lot of people tried to make money. And I represented quite a few of them. [Ralph] That kind of money began to corrupt everything. It corrupted the government, it corrupted the police. There can be no progress in the suburbs unless there's progress in the city. [crowd] Yeah! [Kevin] Coleman Young is the most powerful politician in the history of Detroit. Coleman Young was a machine. And his niece was Cathy Volsan, and she was married to Johnny Curry, one of the biggest drug dealers in Detroit. My wife's uncle was Mayor Coleman Young. [Gregg] There was a protective detail that Coleman Young wanted placed on Cathy Volsan knowing full well that she was married and living with all these drug dealers. And then she heard about the Curry Brothers and what we was into in our life, so we started dating. [Johnny] And then, the next thing you know, we was married. I just find it crazy that he had a protection detail of police officers guarding his drug dealer niece. [Scott] Including Jimmy Harris, who was Mayor Coleman Young's head of security. They were specifically instructed not to intervene in this interactions and in these transactions. One time, I got picked up by, uh, one of the police officers. He knew I had something in the car. He's seen it on the backseat. He said, "Go ahead and go about your way. You want me to escort you in or something like that?" So, I was fine. 'Cause they really never messed with me too tough. Their only job was to follow around Cathy Curry and prevent her from harm. It was a slippery slope, I think, for... for these people. They went downhill, uh, very, very fast. It was wide open for greedy people. And cops is just greedy as we are. If they got debts and so forth, they're gonna turn to crooks. Everybody, every police officer, down at 1300 was crooked. [Johnny] When I was down there, I walked there like... Shit, I did bad as myself. [Scott] Johnny Curry, because of his marriage to Cathy Curry, had a direct line to Gil Hill, who, at the time, was the Detroit Police Department's head of the Homicide Division. Gil Hill had bigger aspirations. [Kevin] He had, uh, become uh, a movie actor. Was in this wildly popular Eddie Murphy movie, Beverly Hills Cop, where he played the boss of Eddie Murphy in the movie. Inspector T., how you doing? Where the [bleep] you've been, Foley? [Kevin] In Detroit, everybody knew Gil Hill, they wanted to talk to Gil Hill and be around Gil Hill. He was probably the biggest celebrity in the city of Detroit at the time. Gil Hill, to me, was a lot more than the Beverly Hills Cop that you see on TV. [William] He actually trained me. He actually taught me the ins and outs of investigations and interrogations. [interviewer] Was Gil Hill affiliated with the drug world? Affiliated? Yeah, he was affiliated. He basically got us to stay away from certain people that he wanted to protect. He'd tell us, "Hey, man, don't be hitting this. Don't do this and that. 'Cause if you made our list, you was gonna be killed." I have nothing bad to say about Gil Hill. [William] He wanted homicides closed. And he wanted to get some resolve to the brutality of taking another person's life. [interviewer] So you're telling me that the head of homicide came to you- and asked who you've got on your hit list? Yeah. Gil. As Gil would say, "Anybody else on your list? I don't give a fuck." That's not the Gil Hill that I know. That doesn't mean that, of course, people don't have dark sides. 'Cause I, too, believe that all people have dark sides. So we would have to listen to Gil because he gonna do us a favor later. In order for us to get favors from him, we got to do favors for him as well, one hand washes the other. He was a guy with quite a bit of cache. He had, he had his eyes set on the mayor's office himself. [Scott] I think he viewed himself as Coleman Young's successor. One of the nation's best-known mayors, Coleman Young of Detroit, is getting a kind of national attention these days that no politician wants. [Scott] Coleman Young was a notoriously corrupt mayor that never got convicted or indicted. [reporter #7] The latest involves charges that his police chief stole from a fund set up for undercover drug buys. And who the [bleep] do you think you are to come in here and cross-examine me? [Joe] He drew enormous animosity from a number of white residents who blamed him for great social ills. And I know a number of people including a number of federal and local law enforcement figures that thought that he was steeped totally in corruption. I don't buy that. I think there are people around him were. [Scott] So, lots of members of federal law enforcement had a giant agenda to go get Coleman Young. And try to tie parts of his administration into the Curry organization. [Kevin] Johnny and Leo Curry were convicted and did a plea agreement for 20 years. I did 14 years. I got a 20-year sentence, I did 14, and came out. [Chris] And one day, I get a tip that they were gonna raid Cathy Volsan-Curry's townhouse. The Feds go in there, and guess who's in there, in bed with Cathy Volsan-Curry? Richard Wershe, Jr. [Chris] Imagine my editors asking me, "What have you got going today?" I said, "Well, an alleged notorious 17-year-old drug dealer was caught in a raid, sleeping with the niece of the mayor on a Friday afternoon." That's a bad day for the Mayor's Office. [Scott] You had race, you had drugs, you had sex, you had political intrigue, you had police corruption. So now, Rick Wershe is dating Coleman Young's niece. [Kevin] And that's a problem for Coleman Young. And it becomes a problem for Rick Wershe. [Chris] Wershe was busted for possessing eight kilos of cocaine. The charge which now has him serving a life sentence. You're not trying to tell me that... you're an angel, that you never did anything wrong, right? I've been involved in wrongdoing, but I don't feel I did anything to receive a life sentence. [Herm] The 650-Lifer Law that, uh, Wershe was convicted under, uh, was repealed in 1998. [Ralph] So the Supreme Court of the State of Michigan said, "That constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, so you can't sentence people to life without parole for a non-violent crime. [low unnerving music] [Gregg] But to be incarcerated for 28 years, he's now a grandfather. [Steve] And everybody kinda recognized it was a fool's errand from the beginning. Just like almost all tough on crime things turned out to be a fool's errand. Until the law was changed, I don't think they caught one, not one large-scale drug dealer. [Chris] Were you ever a cocaine kingpin? [Gregg] And then in the press, they come out and say, "Drug kingpin White Boy Rick." Kingpin of what? Who? He didn't have a drug gang, he didn't have crack houses. -[Chris] You ever kill anyone? -No. -Ever ordered anyone killed? -No. [Gregg] I'm sorry to tell you, that the legend of White Boy Rick is just not true. [Chris] Why would a juvenile, non-violent drug offender be kept in prison beyond 29 years? [Johnny] I did way more than he could possibly ever had done to get that kind of a sentence. Third world countries don't incarcerate like this. [Chris] How does a 16 or 17-year-old kid, Richard Wershe, Jr., how does he get connected to the Curry family? [Wershe] Here's the truth. At the age of 14, I was recruited by the FBI- to become an informant. [foreboding music] [Herm] It's a convoluted story. So when I met, uh, Richard Wershe, Sr., he had been opened up as an informant and operated, uh, for a period of time by two other agents. He was a gun dealer, uh, he was an entrepreneur. There was no end to what he was doing. If he was in one thing, he was always dabbling in the next. [Darlene] But he was very brilliant, he invented a lot of things. And I think he probably held more patents than anyone in the state of Michigan. I think he also had a business, where he would illegally sell guns on the black market. And help people get permits. He even sold silencers. He could get you anything. He could get you grenades. [Scott] And then, kind of played both ends of the game, he would then divulge who he was selling these guns to, to the FBI. At the top of the list of their targets is Johnny Curry and the Curry gang. [Herm] So the first time I met Wershe, Sr. Uh, it was at a McDonald's on the west side of Detroit. And, uh, when I walked into the restaurant, and after introductions were made, I noticed, uh, he's got this young kid with him. It appeared to me to be 15 or so. And when we got talking about the Curry, uh, drug investigation, I noticed the father would defer to the son. [Wershe] My dad didn't really know who these people were. [Herm] And pretty soon, it became apparent to me that really, the kid is somehow the real source of the information. [Wershe] And I kind of interjected and told them who they were- and recognized them from the neighborhood. I just didn't feel comfortable with it. I didn't think it was appropriate. But I wanted to keep the channels of communication open. [Scott] I believe Richard himself, quickly realized that the target for this was big game. [Herm] He was using his son to get paid. It's not the role of a father to do something like that. [sirens blaring] [Scott] And this was something that I think started off as one thing, and ended as another thing. It started off where they would, you know, sometimes pick Rick up and they drive him through the neighborhood. And they say, "Rick, tell us who this guy is. Tell us what that spot is. What's that spot?" [Kevin] So here's this 14-year-old kid getting paid money to inform on narcotics dealers in the city of Detroit. In the short time he was an informant for the police, he collected about $35,000 from law enforcement. [Wershe] I went shopping, I bought stuff. I bought a car when I was 15 years old. It's funny to me how people always talk about what criminals will do to make a dollar. But, you know, on the same regard, you got to look at what the FBI will do to make an arrest. [Scott] He was actually instructed to infiltrate the Curry Boys gang. And start hanging out with the Currys, pretending that you wanna learn the drug game to start making controlled buys. We had started letting him do little errands and then he started knowing a few people that... you figured that when a white boy sells it, the dope is good or whatever. You know, so he started doing his thing. He didn't play a really major role. Nobody would mess with him, though, because they knew he was coming from us, so. [Scott] You know, within a couple of months, Rick is right by Johnny Curry's side. And has become a protégé of Johnny Curry's. I don't think anybody realized that Rick would be able to do that. Let alone, do it so quickly. [interviewer] And were they able to make any arrests out of your information? [Wershe] Oh, yeah. Numerous. [policeman] Go, go, go! -Police! -[thudding] [Kevin] When Rick would say, "Hey, the dope's coming to this house," the dope would come to that house. The police would make a raid, they would confiscate the drugs and money, and, uh, they would be successful. [Wershe] Yeah I believe in one time- in '85 I think it's- eleven or thirteen in one day. [Herm] You know, the whole business of operating informants, it's a cat and mouse game. And just because somebody has an informant designated as the handler for the informant, doesn't preclude that informant from being utilized by other agencies, Such as the Detroit Police Department. [Gregg] Uh, we had DEA involved, the FBI involved. We had United States Customs, Michigan State Police, we had Detroit Police. That's actually what was going on. [Herm] The Detroit Police Department officers were also using, uh, this kid in undercover capacity. Uh, using him to make buys, undercover buys. [Scott] He's going in unmarked police cars, uh, at night, with the police. Driving around, identifying people at certain clubs. And he ain't getting home till three in the morning. And he's got to wake up at 7:00 to go to school. [Wershe] I mean they weren't saying, "Oh, quit school." But they were saying- you know, "we need you to do this." And I'd say "well I've got school tomorrow." And they said "so what, we still"- you know, "go down to this club for us." "You're wasting too much time in Math class. You need to be on the street for us, getting us information." [car whooshing] [Scott] At some point, as the fall progressed in 1984, Johnny Curry was given information that Rick Wershe was an informant. Rick Wershe was giving the Feds information and people were getting busted. So they knew somebody was, was leaking information, and they would have meetings, talking about who the informant might be. [Scott] There were a lot of people on the street that believed that Johnny Curry ordered Rick Wershe's murder. So I remember being at the home that my boyfriend and I shared, and he said, "Here comes your dad." And I said, "Tell him I'm not here." [Dawn] And I was standing in the bedroom listening to him talk to my dad at the front door and my dad said, "Tell her, her brother's been shot." And right then, I fell to the floor. I got in the car with my dad and we went to the hospital. Rick was with a, uh, another Curry lieutenant, who was a couple years older than him. [Wershe] We were in the house Approximately five minutes. We were both skipping school that day. He went upstairs. [Scott] And after a couple of minutes, says, "Hey, Rick. Come over here. Come to the stairs." [Wershe] As soon as I hit the top of the stairs he comes out of the bedroom, shoots me in the stomach. [Dawn] He was shot at close range with a .357 magnum. Went in the front, out the back, blew his large intestine in half. [Wershe] I believe I rolled down the stairs. I was asking them to call 911. He wouldn't call 911- he was in a panic. By the grace of God his girlfriend walked in the house. And she's the one that called 911. The guy that shot me- his older brother and a friend of his were putting me in the car. I don't know if they were going to take me to a hospital or take me somewhere and dump me. Finally an ambulance showed up and blocked them off and- told them to give me to them and- basically that ambulance ride saved my life. [Johnny] I had nothing to do with his getting shot. If an agent said it or whoever said it, a police officer, whoever said it, they're way out of order, then. Rick's family and the task force all arrived in the waiting room of the hospital. There's a physical altercation between Richard and the FBI handlers. [Scott] Richard blames them for getting his son shot and, at that time, thinking he might die. The task force were kind of huddled by the snack machines. They had realized that if he died, the fact that they had been using a 14-year-old kid to infiltrate druggings was gonna come to the surface and it would be a scandal of all scandals. The surgeon, Dr. Bowles, that performed surgery and saved Rick's life sat next to his bedside. I believe it was for ten or twelve hours. Because he didn't think he was gonna make it. But he did, thank god. I really honestly believe this is a turning point. Because he could've pumped the brakes. He could've said, "You know what? This is crazy. We almost got this kid killed. We need to stop everything right now and just do this, you know, by the book." [Scott] But, instead, members of that task force came with a conclusion this would increase his credibility. [Wershe] The police told me to say the shooting was an acident- because it was the best way to sweep it under the rug- and I could continue to work for them if I said it was an accident. We're gonna push it into high gear. [Scott] We're gonna send him back in to the Curry gang and if there was any belief that he was an informant before, that belief was gonna go out the window because if he was a snitch, Johnny Curry would be in handcuffs right now. So, by the mere fact of him going back to his old neighborhood, it built up his reputation as a drug dealer, uh, not an informant. It almost helped him in that regard. [Scott] During Rick's recovery, Johnny Curry called him and, you know, said, "Where have you been? What's going on?" Eventually, Rick met him and was kinda like confronted him. "You thought I was an informant. You had me shot." And Johnny denied it. Now, he might've mentioned it. I don't know. I had nothing to do with it. [Scott] But from that point forward, Rick was in tighter than ever. [funky music] [commentator] And we're live from Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. Where Top Rank presents World Championship Boxing. [Herm] Johnny Curry and his entourage had gone to Las Vegas to the Hearns-Hagler fight. [announcer] Fighting out of Detroit, Michigan... [Scott] Tommy Hearns who was Detroit's favorite son in the boxing game at that time, was facing off against "Marvelous" Marvin Hagler. And all of the major urban drug dealers of Detroit went to the fight. [Kevin] And this was the golden era of boxing. The Tommy Hearns- Marvin Hagler fight was all anybody was talking about in sports. [Scott] Tommy Hearns grew up and socialized with a lot of the black drug dealers in the era. And the kind of joke was, last guy in Detroit turn off the lights. [crowd cheering] [Wershe] I was asked to go out there and- get information about some people that were- involved in the drug trade- and their corrections and- how the drugs were coming in and- just basically as much intel as I could from out there. I was given a fake ID. I was 15 at the time- the ID made me 21 years old. So, they gave him money, they gave him false ID, and they set him up in a casino. [Ralph] This is insanity. [Wershe] There's an FBI report detailing that and it shows- I think they gave me- like $1,500- on a receipt and then I think they gave me like another- thousand or 1,500 bucks for pocket money. [Scott] While they're at the fight, Johnny Curry and his entourage's reservations and fight tickets mysteriously disappear. Or maybe disappear is the wrong word. They never really existed to start. [Scott] Johnny had reached out to a member of his crew by a guy of a name of Leon Lucas and him and Johnny had kinda gotten into a beef over drugs and money that had been confiscated in a raid. Johnny Curry held him responsible for the drugs and money. [Scott] And Leon said, "Let me start to try to make it up for you. I will provide you hotel arrangements and tickets for the Hagler-Hearns fight. Now, he assured Johnny Curry that it would all be taken care of. Well, when Curry and his posse got out there, nothing was handled, nothing was taken care of. [Herm] And when he got back to Detroit, some of his lieutenants not at the direction of Johnny Curry himself, but some of his lieutenants went over to Leon Lucas' house in an effort to intimidate him. What those individuals that went there decided to do was to shoot the place up in a drive-by shooting. Unfortunately, for them, Leon Lucas isn't there. [911 operator] [911 operator] [caller] [911 operator] [Kevin] And in the process, Leon's nephew, Damion Lucas, who was 13-years old, and was living with him, was shot and killed. And this becomes a very hot topic in law enforcement. [Scott] On the news, "13-year-old Killed in Drive-by." [Herm] You know, I heard Johnny Curry, uh, on wiretaps. Uh, shortly after we got the authority to tap his phone. And he was lamenting, whoever he was talking with, that, "You know, those guys shouldn't have gone over there. I told them don't go over there." He was sorry that this whole thing had taken place. Probably because it was bringing a lot of heat on him, uh, and his drug organization. [somber music] Rick Wershe comes back into play in this whole story. And that Rick says he was, uh, listening in on a phone conversation over a speakerphone, and he heard Johnny Curry talking to Gil Hill. [Wershe] And that's when I found out that Gil Hill was responsible for covering up the kid's murder. Johnny placed a call to Gil, put it on speaker- we were riding around in Johnny's BMW. Basically Gil told him everything that was going on, and- you know- that he had it under control, and that he would be in touch- not to worry about anything. He had already been to meet with Gil and- he said he gave Gil ten grand to cover up the kid's murder. This information made him incredibly dangerous to a lot of people. Johnny Curry told this to me while he was incarcerated at the Texarkana Federal Correctional Facility in Texas. [Herm] So, ultimately, what happened is the, uh, Detroit Police Department, under the direction of Gil Hill, uh, framed, basically, an innocent man, LaKeas Davis. I had information. Part of it was from Richard Wershe, Jr., and part it was from the wiretaps that we had that strongly suggested that they had the wrong guy locked up. And he's facing a life term. [Nate] Well, sometime he had tell us to put the gun in somebody's car. One of our enemies. And then he had the police pull up on them and said, "Wait, wait. Is that a gun hanging out on your seat?" Well, the people don't know that we just slipped the gun in their car. [laughter] Same way we did with a pot of drugs. He used to tell us to set people up with drug bust too. That's the way they get busses. [Gregg] Subsequently, I was ordered by my special agent in charge to gather all of the information that we had with regards to the Damion Lucas murder and take it directly to Chief Hart of the Detroit Police Department. I did so and nothing ever occurred. To this day, it's still an open investigation. [Herm] In fact, LaKeas Davis remained in jail was facing a trial. And so I made sure Davis' defense attorney got the information that he needed to get him exonerated. Ultimately, that resulted in me being subpoenaed to state court. And where demands were met on me to reveal the source of the information. Well, it became very touch-and-go because there would be extreme retaliation against the Wershe family. And so I refused to do it. And, um, I was threatened with contempt of court. Ultimately, they dismissed the case against LaKeas Davis and they freed him at that point. [Scott] And Gil Hill was investigated for his role in taking a possible payoff and possibly burying these charges. He was never charged. And when Gil Hill ran for mayor, this case came up and was a detriment to his campaign. At that point, I didn't realize to, uh, what extent the corruption had spread throughout the police department. [Gregg] When we did the raid on Cathy Volsan-Curry's house which was in June of 1987, we found a laminated card exactly like this one, holding the personal and confidential information from Gil Hill and Jimmy Harris which ended up being the beginning of all the rumors that we had heard with regards to the funneling of information from the Detroit Police Department to the Curry organization. So was that uncommon for Cathy to have that kind of access? She had access to anything she wanted. [Chris] Like what? Police reports, surveillance reports, whatever you wanted. [Chris] On Johnny? Johnny, myself, other people who needed this stuff. [Chris] So, if she said to Sgt. Jimmy Harris, "I need to know what the narcotics cops are doing on Rick, on Johnny, on anybody else," he would flip them to her? No problem. [Herm] The matter of the Damion Lucas murder was never resolved. I knew who did it and, but, uh, proving it is something else. [Wershe] Truthfully I wish I never woulda got roped into the Damion Lucas thing, because- I didn't know 30 years later it would still be affecting my life. [ominous music] Well, I was, uh, told to kill White Boy Rick. We heard that he was telling. So, they say, "We gotta kill that white boy." [Todd] My career is finished. But I promise you, I won't go down alone. [Nate] I know after he did, uh, Beverly Hill Cops and all that, he was trying to stay away from everybody. But he would meet you somewhere as long as he feel he was safe. Like he would meet you out at The Island in Waterfront. But, yeah, uh... He said that basically, he wants us to make sure that we kill White Boy Rick. Make sure that boy is dead. But we gotta make sure that it don't lead back to no one. I said, "Well, you know me. All my hits don't lead back to no one." [Scott] Rick had got in deeper and had risen higher than anyone ever thought he could. [Wershe] At some point these guys said- sooner or later something's going to go bad- and we're going to be held accountable. [Ralph] They don't debrief him. They don't send him to a boarding school where he can get over what they've just subjected him to. They turn him loose on the streets. [Wershe] It wasn't like they ever said- "Rick, stop selling drugs." "Rick, stop buying drugs." One day they just never called again- and that's how we broke ties. He wasn't gonna go back to school. He knew the drug trade. So, he became a drug dealer. [Wershe] I became addicted to the lifestyle. I became addicted to the money. I became addicted to the women. I became addicted to that life. [Scott] The only difference was, you know, he wasn't getting a government stipend. They had gleaned enough information and intelligence from him regarding the Curry gang that the indictment was on the horizon. The indictment would drop within a couple months. [Kevin] Rick will tell you that it wasn't the smartest thing to do, to date the wife of a man you put in prison or help put in prison. Uh, but it happened. I still wouldn't hold nothing against that. She was getting high. What can you say, so... [Wershe] I was a 17 year old kid- I was having fun. To be honest, dating her back then was like- dating a movie star or something. I remember one time, back in those days, I had a '63 black Corvette convertible with red interior. [Chris] And I'm driving it downtown. Who comes driving by? Rick Wershe and his friends. And I forget what kind of car but it was relatively new and nice. "Hey, Chris. What's going on?" -[car whooshes] - You speed off. He was enjoying the celebrity moment. He was a kid. And he was famous for all the wrong reasons but he was living the life. But I knew that was White Boy Rick's ride. [Nate] So we followed him. I speeded up trying to get to him. [Wershe] Me and Roy were sitting at a stoplight in a car- and I happened to look over my shoulder and I seen a van pulling up. And I saw the door sliding- it was like cracked open. And I told Roy, I said, "Roy, run the light!" We stopped. That side door pulled open. [Nate] Who's siting in the chair? [imitates gun firing, jamming] "Man, hand me another gun," I said. I think we better reach up in the... By that time, they had speeded off. [Wershe] I mean they got shots off- the car was hit. That's the only reason why he was still alive. That MAC jammed on us. [Wershe] I had friends that were murdered. To be honest, you're a kid and you don't realize- everyday that you were playing with fire- that you could walk out your door one day and your life would be over. [ominous music] [Ralph] And in that period of time, he became what is known as a "wait man." As a wait man, he had a line of credit with some drug importers in Miami. He brought a lot of drugs into Detroit in a very short period of time. He was not a drug dealer for very long, but he was nowhere near the big-time drug dealers. [Johnny] From a scale to one to ten, I'm a ten, I'd say he was about a two. Rick was nowhere near me. Guys like the Chambers or guys like the Currys they controlled whole sections of the city. Rick didn't control anything. I used to say, "Where did they... Where is they getting this stuff from? I guess this Chris Hansen guy. I don't know." I never set out to make Rick look like a bigger drug dealer than he was. [Chris] Were there some exaggerations? Perhaps. [Scott] There were seeds of truth to what they were saying. He was socializing with all of the major players, so it was hard for the media to divorce that. You know, whether he was a drug kingpin, a drug lord, a drug prince, a drug prodigy, he was a 17-year-old kid dealing multi-kilos of dope and very few adults do that. Rick couldn't deal with a lot of guys... A lot of people that I've dealt with, Rick couldn't even see them. Johnny and his brother, and his people, they were grown men. These are grown men. [Steve] And this was a kid. That's the difference. A 17-year-old white kid? It was impossible for him to have been what people have pretended that he was. [Wershe] It wasn't like I went out and said- I want to become this big drug dealer and- want everyone in the state of Michigan to know me. I was led down this path by law enforcement. I think about every day if I would have walked away. I was a kid. I was stupid. So, when you look at it at the end of the day, you know, law enforcement created, almost a perfect criminal. [Scott] And law enforcement created the perfect persona, a perfect character for the local news, for the local media, and they ate it up. I covered it a lot. Rick will say I had him on TV every day. Obviously, that's not true. He's just saying that to make a point. They convicted me through the media, through the papers. I was the public enemy number one and they said stuff that was totally untrue. Were there stories about him ordering hits on people that weren't true floating around? Absolutely. I heard them. But they never prosecuted him for it. My grandfather who was a judge in Detroit at the time of Mr. Wershe's case had presided over his case for a brief period of time. [Dana] And he calls him, "Worse than a mass murderer," and gave him a one-million-dollar bond. It was the highest bond my grandfather had ever set for any defendant. If you have so much evidence that he's been involved in a drug hit, bring a case. If not, rumors don't count in court. On May 23rd, 1987, Rick Wershe and a man named Roy Grissom were arrested driving down Hampshire near Dickerson. [Ralph] It ended with his arrest which is kind of an interesting story because it was probably a setup. [Scott] Rick, at this point, has hooked up with two Colombian wholesale cocaine dealers in Miami. They would send kilos up to Detroit in trailers. He got a shipment. I believe, it was an 18-kilo shipment. They drop off ten kilos of cocaine to a customer and they have a pile of cash in the car. And they passed a police car that was just, um, routine traffic duty. And I believe he actually waved at the police officer because he knew him. [Kevin] They're driving home. They get pulled over. Allegedly for going through a stop sign. [Scott] At this point, there's a bunch of people on the porch including Rick's sister, Dawn. And we watched it all unfold. He said, "Okay, guys, what's going on?" And they said, "You're under arrest." And he said, "For what?" And they said, "Possession of drugs." And he told them, "I don't have any drugs." And they said they were in the car. He said, "Search it." One of the police officers reaches into the back of the car and pulls out a bag with the cash. So my dad ran out there and grabbed the bag of money. Officers say a tussle started. A fight almost between Wershe, Grissom, and the officers. Investigators say that Wershe took off running. [Scott] About 25 minutes, a half-hour later, the police find him and they roughed him up pretty good. To the point where he had to go to the hospital. So, the next three or four hours, the police are combing the neighborhood looking for drugs. They got an anonymous tip. [Chris] Later, more police arrived and eventually they found a box containing eight kilos of cocaine under this back porch, a block away from the traffic stop. [Wershe] I was responsible for those drugs. I had to pay the people in Miami for those drugs. [Kevin] Rick believes that it was a setup. That they were watching him and they knew he would have drugs or money. And they say that when he ran out of the car, he hid the cocaine underneath a porch and continued to run away. And he's charged with that crime. The attorney that was representing him at the time was an attorney by the name of William Bufalino. And he brought motions to suppress the evidence. [Ralph] Shortly thereafter, Coleman Young's niece told Rick, "Everything will be okay but you need to get different attorneys." [Kevin] They decided that they needed an African-American attorney. And that it would look better to the jury. [Ralph] "Hire Ed Bell and Sam Gardner and everything will be okay." When they went forward, they changed their strategy. They, they decided not to heavily pursue the idea that these drugs where not Rick's. Fatal mistake. [Wershe] Sam Gardner was Coleman Young's lawyer at the time, and- the only reason they were brought in- was to watch me. It wasn't to help me. Basically, every time I went to see him, he just told me, "I had nothing to worry about. Things were looking good." I was told at one time that I wouldn't go to trial. He didn't think that we would go to trial. Before they went to trial, his trial attorneys agreed to withdraw all the pretrial motions. [Ralph] They agreed not to admit any evidence in front of the jury that he had been working for the government since he was 14. So, the jury never heard that. [Wershe] Basically I think the fix was in- and Coleman didn't want me on the streets anymore. So them being my attorneys- I think they tanked the case. [Steve] I think it was like a whirlwind that just kind of swept them up. 'Cause the phone conversation I remember having with him, he was kind of baffled by his notoriety. And then that time when I saw him, you know, he's waiting on his jury and all these assholes are around him. All of them wanted him to be convicted I'm sure, that's why they showed up. Rick took the nickname and ran with it. I mean, he didn't have to wear the fur coats. He didn't have to show up to trial with a whole crew of little kids wearing beepers and gold chains. He came to court like a drug dealer. I said, "Rick, if those jurors see all these little crooks running around with you, you're dead." We was told to show up down there with our expensive cars, jewelry, and just get in front of the news. [Nate] These all his workers. Kingpin is on trial. Drug lord is on trial. And his friends down here trying to free him. Of course, it hurt him. There's no doubt about it, it hurt him. Same police officers paid us to do that. [Nate] Ain't nobody ever heard of him being no drug lord until they print that shit in the paper. Where the hell was he a kingpin of? Us blacks? Oh, hell no. We made it seem like that, but he wasn't. They had this newspaper article where they actually listed him as the leader of the Best Friends gang. Which is crazy, you know. Best Friends were like this hit gang that had over a hundred murders. It's just incredible and crazy. [Joe] We had to rely on law enforcement. We saw the documents. We saw them firsthand. They were shared with us and we did our best to vet them. But we were certainly not making stuff up or fabricating. There was enough going on to keep us all busy with crazy-enough stories. You had characters like Maserati Rick who survived an assassination attempt and then was murdered in his hospital bed. And in the nightstand was a pistol and a crucifix and, uh, rosary beads. He was buried in a Mercedes-Benz coffin. So you didn't have to make stuff up. But that's how the cops had it set up. And that's how they listed him and that's how we reported it. And that's how we sourced it in the story and the graphic illustrations, that this was based on law enforcement documents and sources. It was a political move. [Nate] That's why they could put him away forever. [Wershe] Nate was showing up down there- which we saw Nate there- to try and do some harm to me. [Nate] I was trying to shoot him out at the courthouse. We had the van already parked up on Gratiot. I already had the scope and everything scoped in, but, at that point, they walked him underneath into the courthouse. "What do you mean he in the courtroom?" They said, "Yeah, he in the courtroom." [Wershe] Of course we were a little more careful and- when we left the courthouse, or where we parked the car, or whatever. He wasn't there to wish me well at trial. And he was convicted and, after that, it was easy. [Ralph] You're going to jail. You're never gonna see the light of day. [foreboding music] [Herm] This operation was called Operation Backbone. The reason I named it Backbone, I figured you need some backbone to work this case, you know. At that time, it was the most significant police corruption investigation in the state of Michigan. The objective was I knew through the Curry investigation and the Damion Lucas homicide that that investigation was partly compromised. And I knew that there were corrupt police officers involved in this thing. So, that was the objective, to get these corrupt cops. [Ralph] And he called out of the blue and I said, "What's going on, Rick?" He said, "Well, the FBI is here and they want me to help them. They have said that they will help me if I help them." "But if you cooperate on this undercover project and everything works fine, the best I can do is, maybe, take you out of the state custody and put you in the Federal Witness Protection Program in a federal facility with other informants. And it might just be a better situation. And if you ever become eligible for parole, I'll come back and testify for you. I'll tell them what you did." He said, "You know what?" We shook hands and that was the agreement we made. And the Feds, during that time, were chasing Coleman Young hard. They wanted to bring down the mayor of Detroit. [Wershe] The FBI wanted to use my relationship with Cathy- to target the mayor- as well as police corruption within the city of Detroit. They were targetting Willie Volson. He was married to the mayor's sister. He was Cathy's father of course and- everyone knew that Willie had pull- throughout the city of Detroit. The other target of operation was Jimmy Harris. He was a high ranking Detroit police official. He did whatever mayor Young told him to do. He covered up the thinks that the mayor's family did. To my knowledge, for the right price- they were willing to protect drug shipments- from anywhere, I mean- if it was in the city of Detroit and they could make a buck off of it- they were willing to provide that police protection. [Herm] So, I got Rick Wershe's sister, Dawn, to cooperate with me as well. And she had a relationship with Cathy. I had an agent by the name of Mike Castro who had served extensively in the Caribbean and knew the Caribbean pretty well. [Wershe] I introduced Mike Castro- who was the undercover FBI agent- to Cathy. He posed as my supplier from Miami. And me knowing Cathy and her family- how greedy they were- I knew Cathy would cut into him- and that's exactly what happened. [Herm] We arranged a dinner with Wershe's sister, Cathy Volsan-Curry, and Mike Castro. Which I attended, but I was off to the side and it was recorded. So, during that conversation, uh, Cathy was just enamored with the prospect of getting back into the cocaine business and so forth. Uh, her eyes lit up. And at that point, she offered her police assistance. [FBI Agent] So basically we're businessmen- we're in the drug business. [Herm] We invited Willie Volsan and James Harris down to Florida. Had an undercover yacht. [Herm] Sat down there, and on videotape, and negotiated the deal. [FBI Agent] We'd like to- fly something in. We're going to look like businessmen delivering packages. [James] Okay. - Only us and you will know it's drugs. No one else is going to know anything. [Harris] Okay. [FBI Agent] We're going to probably- ship up in the plane around 100 keys. - You provide protection- and protection from the police. Think you can handle that? [Harris] What you're talking about is no problem. [FBI Agent] Right. [Harris] I've got three Detroit police officers myself- it's cool. [FBI Agent] Okay. [FBI Agent] Alright. [Harris] These people have been with me. [FBI Agent] You can trust them. We'll have out equipment, our van or whatever- load it up. Just like the money laundering operation- you escort us away from the airport- out on the highway and- sayonara! - For a successful mission and a- a good escape and all of that- 40-50 grand? So do we got a deal? [Volson &amp; Harris] Yep. [James] We go. We go. [FBI Agent] Partners in crime brother! - Here we go. [Chris] Willie and Cathy along with Detroit Police Sergeant Jimmy Harris were charged last month in an FBI corruption case alleging that police officers took payoffs to protect drug and drug money shipments coming into the city in Metro Airport. [Wershe] Any other mayor would have been glad to have corruption out of their police department. Unless your brother-in-law is the head of the corruption. And then this guy goes on to call me a stool pigeon. That's like an old gangster term for a rat. Did that put your life in danger, having Coleman Young call you a stool pigeon? [Wershe] Oh, there's no doubt about it. [Herm] Eighteen corrupt police officers and politicians, as a result of Wershe's direct involvement in this thing, went to prison. [Herm] And without White Boy Rick or Richard Wershe, Jr. it's I think he'd prefer to be called at this point, that never would have happened. And they haven't even scratched the surface. The corruption runs so deep in there it's... [Wershe] It's insane, man. [Chris] During the FBI investigation, Hill met with Harris, a longtime friend, Volsan, and the undercover agent posing as the drug dealer. [Herm] Willie would, uh, constantly brag about his relationship with Gil Hill. [Herm] And so, toward the end of the operation, we wanted to see if he'd actually set up an introduction to Gil Hill, and he did. We got a wiretap authority to install wiretaps inside of Willie Volsan's car. [Herm] And we arranged it for both undercover agents to meet with Gil Hill and Willie Volsan, and that happened. During that conversation, Mike Castro let it be known that he was a money launderer and they were drug dealers. Uh, that plainly. [Herm] It was my thought that, uh, if Gil Hill wanted to get up and run out of that meeting, so be it. He's an innocent guy. But if he stayed, that meant something else. And not only did he stay, but he had a conversation which was taped. And in that conversation, Gil Hill said he wanted to get money from Mike Castro. I got authorization to pay him the money, $20,000.00. The thing languished, and it languished, and it languished before the bureaucrats could make up their mind. When they finally made up their mind, uh, the trail had cooled. [Herm] I think Gil, at that point, uh, being a smart guy, he smelled a rat and, and didn't take the bait, so we lost an opportunity. [Chris] But Hill refused to get involved. He says the entire probe smacks of entrapment. [Chris] It seems like this upset you. Tremendously. Now, is he this major criminal mastermind? I don't think so. Was he a guy who played fast and loose, and... Perhaps. And maybe have crossed the line a couple of times. But try as they might, and I know the Feds who were chasing him, trying their damndest. These were solid hardworking guys after him. They were not dogging it. If they could have caught him, they would have. They didn't. [Kevin] Reporters were chasing Gil Hill down the street, asking him if he was involved in taking bribes. [Kevin] And that's very damaging if you wanna be the next mayor of the city of Detroit. [Scott] Gil Hill ran for mayor and lost, but Gil Hill blames Rick for him not becoming the mayor. [Wershe] I think helping the FBI with Operation Backbone- was the biggest mistake of my life. Because it created enemies that- I couldn't even imagine- I was a kid. I didn't think of the political aspects of it. There's still a lot of angry people in the city of Detroit in positions of power. [ominous music] In Michigan, you're supposed to have an opportunity to have a parole hearing every five years. Rick Wershe has only had one parole hearing in 28 years in prison. That parole hearing was in 2003, and it was a spectacle. [dramatic music] [Ralph] When you're up for parole, what the parole board does is they send letters out to the original trial judge. [Ralph] In Rick's case, it was a judge by the name of Thomas Jackson who's recently retired. And Judge Jackson wrote back and he said, "I have no problem with this young man getting out. He's served a long time in jail." They then send the letter at the same time to the prosecuting attorney's office. [Ralph] The chief prosecutor was a fellow by the name of Michael Duggan. And Michael Duggan is now the mayor of the city of Detroit. [Ralph] The first response from that office was, "We have no problem with him getting out." Two weeks later, another letter comes from that office saying, "Disregard the first letter. We don't want him out." In the letter, which was a multipage letter, they were saying that Richard Wershe, Jr. was responsible for the downfall of the city of Detroit. Rick Wershe was involved in cases as a juvenile where the witnesses just disappeared. That this kid is so dangerous that he should never be let out of prison. And it was signed by Michael Duggan. [Ralph] If you ask him today, he'll tell you he doesn't remember that letter and he didn't remember signing it. If you look at the letter, the name right underneath Michael Duggan is that of his chief assistant, Samuel Gardner. Rick's two defense attorneys at the time he was convicted was Samuel Gardner and Ed Bell, who were law partners. [Wershe] He wanted to keep me in prison as long as he could. I mean here's a guy that was my lawyer- and was the number two prosecutor- told me I had nothing to worry about. And then this letter that was- so outlandish and crazy gets sent to the parole board. I think it proves that they threw the case from the beginning- and that their ultimate goal was to keep me in prison. [Kevin] So I went over to the hearing, and, in, in the first day of the hearing, I heard federal agents say that Rick Wershe was very helpful. Instrumental in bringing down dirty cops and other drug dealers in Detroit, and that they believed he should be let out of prison, that he should be paroled. You come back the next day, and it's a completely different story. The Wayne County Prosecuting Attorney brings in three or four homicide detectives. I was approached by Deputy Chief Dennis Richardson, and was told that I was gonna go to the parole hearing. The goal of the hearing was to make sure that he was not released. That Richard Wershe was considered to be dangerous. They characterized him as, uh, Al Capone. [Ralph] And they start detailing the collapse of the city. And then I talked about, in generalities, the damage that drugs had did to the city of Detroit. - The story of all of the homicides, and all of the drugs, and all of the murders. - That was the extent of my contact with the parole board. But the other members of the police department and, and law enforcement that was there went into generalities also. [Ralph] And if you read it, the transcript, carefully, they just keep throwing Rick Wershe, Jr.'s name in. They never say that he does this stuff. It's fair that you could have implied that they knew about Richard Wershe. Because they slanted it to whereas he was to be considered dangerous when they didn't know anything at all about him. They never even worked drugs. And some of them ended up in prison themselves. In order to prepare for the parole hearing, I was given information to review and look at so that I can familiarize myself with Richard Wershe. They went to the Detroit Free Press and said, "We need to have all of the news articles with regards to Rick Wershe because we wanna review a bunch of this information. Well, now we know that half of the stuff that's in print wasn't true at all. It was made up by the news media. Listening to these police officers say that Rick Wershe was violent and dangerous and should not be let out of prison was hard-hitting. And it was powerful. It was a powerful testimony. You had some people that testified in favor of Rick Wershe including Kid Rock, the musician. [Kevin] Kid Rock did not show up with a big entourage. He came by himself. He drove himself to that hearing, and he told the parole board very plainly that, "This could have been me if the circumstances were different," and that Rick Wershe deserves to get out. And he quietly went away. [Kevin] But ultimately, the story didn't play out that way. The police jumped on the fact that Kid Rock was there and they basically put out the story line that, "What? Is White Boy Rick gonna get out of prison and go be a roadie for Kid Rock? [Kevin] There's a real recipe for success. Let's take this drug dealer and put him with a big-time rapper, and let's see how well he does. Let's see if he's really reformed. This is not gonna work." And that played well. It played well with the public and I think it played with the parole board. [Herm] And, uh, the result was they turned down his parole. It was a sham. There was absolutely no reason for any of us to be there to try to prevent him from being released. I voted to have Rick Wershe released. It made sense. There was no reason in this world that he should still be there. This whole thing stinks to high heaven. [Wershe] I think it goes back to Gil Hill. All roads lead back to him. I mean- there's someone or some thing that's keeping me in prison and it's not the crime that I committed. [wind howling] [Herm] So, uh, a couple of years after the parole hearing, uh, probably around 2005, Wershe, Jr., uh, was of course in, uh, federal, uh, protective custody, uh, witness protection program doing his life sentence. I became aware that he was involved, in a very minor way, in an auto theft ring. He became aware of the ability to obtain a car for his mother. Consisted of him making some phone calls on behalf of the people that were actually involved in the auto theft ring. When the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office found out, they made phone calls to the United States Attorney's Office down in Miami saying, "You make sure he's indicted and the full extent of the law comes down on him." [Wershe] I was told, "You take a plea bargain, or I am going to arrest your mom and your sister." So what do I do? I took a plea bargain. So he pled guilty and got a five-year sentence. [Scott] Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of all other cases, the five years will run concurrently with the life sentence that he's under in Michigan. But because Rick's Rick, the sentence was ruled to run consecutively. If and when he's released here, which I pray is soon, he has to go to Florida and finish out time. [Scott] And if you look at the guy's prison record, with the exception of that one incident, he is someone that is a model prisoner. "He has remained misconduct-free during his entire sentence with the MDOC which started in February 5th, 1988. Mr. Wershe has maintained steady employment and has never been a management problem for staff. [Dana] He has good communication skills and interacts well with staff and other inmates alike." In my opinion, that would show that Mr. Wershe was a model prisoner. [Dana] And there's no reason that he should have been denied parole for so long. [somber music] [Dana] "Now, based on my reading of the briefs, all parties agreed that defendant's original sentence of life without the possibility of parole for a juvenile who committed a non-violent offense involving drugs was unconstitutional. The case law over the last decade has demanded that we treat juveniles constitutionally different than adults. That difference requires us to consider the defendant's age at the time the crime was committed. [Dana] Where a defendant's sentence violates the constitution, recent case law holds that remedy for that violation is resentencing." [Kevin] Suddenly in 2015, Judge Dana Hathaway decided that she wanted to resentence Rick Wershe and it was a major decision. [Ralph] Uh, he's stunned. I mean, you can see in the courtroom, uh, he, he doesn't know where to go. I mean, he is just almost in shock. We need him out. He's been in long enough. I'm a bit overwhelmed because I've only seen my father in person maybe two or three times in my life, so it was a difficult relationship to know someone your whole life and not really. [Dawn] They wouldn't even allow him out for my dad's funeral. When my dad was dying of cancer, we, um... We asked and they said, "No. It's too high of a security risk." [Wershe] I wold like to spread my dad's ashes somewhere and- visit my grandparents' grave. I just wanna see him, like I said, and spend time with him before I die. [Wershe] My mother's not in good health, I mean- after twenty-nine years you don't hit the ground running- but I think I have a good support team. He's supposed to get out. And if he doesn't get out, I want you, news guys, to be investigating as to who in the hell wants him in and who has that kind of power to keep him in. Wershe will be back here in two weeks to hear the judge's sentence. If it is the time served, it's possible he could walk out of here a free man. [Kevin] It would definitely mean that his time as a prisoner is near its end. [Kevin] Kym Worthy objected to that. She's the prosecutor in Wayne County. In 2015, she said, "We believe the law says that Rick Wershe must stay in prison until the parole board releases him." [Kevin] So as it stands right now, Rick Wershe will not be resentenced. [Dana] When Prosecutor Worthy objected to my resentencing, I was disappointed. I didn't think that there was a legitimate basis for it. And then when the Court of Appeals sided with the prosecutor, [stutters] I was disappointed again. I thought that, uh, my opinion had strong legal footing given the fact that his sentence was ultimately an Eighth Amendment violation and I thought the remedy should have been resentencing. [Wershe] Oh, I'm disappointed. I mean- let down a little bit, but- I expected it to be honest with you. After all this time in here you don't believe you're doing to get out of here- until the day you walk out of here. [Kevin] Kym Worthy is one of the main people standing in his way of becoming a free man. And she's made no public statement over the years. She's never given any indication why she's so dead set on Rick Wershe staying in prison. [Kevin] I've done dozens of stories on the injustice of Rick Wershe still being in prison. And I've truly felt that the stories I've done should have been enough for people to do the right thing, but that hasn't happened. [Dana] His sentence shocks the conscience. How long he was in shocks the conscience. I'm not saying he was innocent, but part our job is letting the punishment fit the crime. And here, it absolutely did not. For a juvenile defendant to never have his age taken into consideration was highly inappropriate and inconsistent with the case law that's been evolving for the past decade. He's a juvenile non-violent offender who served 29 years. He should be out. He is a political prisoner. [Scott] He is being held against his will by the politicians of Michigan for crimes he never did! There is a relationship between the current Wayne County prosecutor and Gil Hill. [Joe] From what I saw, Kym Worthy and Gil Hill had a professional and political relationship. [Herm] Uh, she and Gil Hill worked together especially when he was, um, city council, so they have a long history. So I think that's where the issue is. Well, the city lost a good one today. Gilbert Hill, or Gil as we knew him, died today peacefully with family by his side. [reporter #8] He was a legendary homicide detective in Detroit and, of course, landed the role of Eddie Murphy's foul-mouthed boss in Beverly Hills Cop. [somber music] [Kevin] Two huge stories today. First is statement from Kym Worthy that she gave exclusively to the defenders. Kym Worthy saying she is going to reconsider her stance. She may no longer object to Wershe being locked up. [Kevin] This decision by Kym Worthy coming the very same day that a hitman says he was hired by a police officer to kill Rick Wershe back in the '80s. Maybe they need to step down and let the boy out before I start really naming names and they know who they are. [Kevin] In that documentary, I'm told that Nate Craft is going to say that former Mayor Coleman Young and former City Council President Gil Hill went to great lengths to make sure that White Boy Rick Wershe would stay in prison for the rest of his life. So, finally, after all of this time, Kym Worthy says she's not going to stand in Rick Wershe's way, but she's not gonna do anything to help him either. [Kevin] She's going to leave that up to the parole board. [Gregg] Well, that's the problem, is the parole board. They believe whoever is sitting there talking to them and they never ask any questions. [Gregg] They just listen to it all and then they vote. And half the time, they've listened to the wrong information. The Supreme Court in, in the State of Michigan needs to take a look at this, or the governor needs to pardon him. Every time I've called the Governor's Office, I've been told by his Office of General Counsel that the governor doesn't get involved. In any of the parole instances, he turns it over to the parole board. Think about that concept. These are unelected people that are on the board. They're just regular people and they're appointed by the governor. And you as the governor of the state of Michigan that get elected by the citizens you're going to say, "Oh, what do you want me to do?" The parole board says they shouldn't do anything." That's crazy. [Kevin] I think people in Michigan are finally realizing that this story is not going away and it's not staying local. It's going to get bigger. It's going to get national. It's gonna get international. And someone's gonna have to answer as to why Rick Wershe is still in prison because nobody has answered for that yet. This is the Claus von Bülow case uh, that, uh, I was the appellant lawyer. And you don't get too many cases where the reversal of the conviction makes the front page of the New York Times. [Kevin] Attorney Alan Dershowitz has an office full of memories from the big cases. OJ Simpson, Mike Tyson, Patty Hearst, Jim Baker. He can't see any reason Rick Wershe should still be behind bars. [Alan] This is a terrible, terrible injustice. This sentence has so many constitutional problems that one would hope a court would look at it very skeptically. [Alan] One might at least have the hope that they will see the thing in context, and say to themselves, "Oh, my God. Young man, drug offense. Look at how much time he spent. That doesn't make sense." Alan Dershowitz has agreed to assist Rick Wershe's attorney, Ralph Musilli, saying, "An injustice like this needs as much public attention as possible." Who's gonna be the hero here and do the right thing? [Dana] I don't really think anyone can look at all the facts surrounding this case and not feel bad for him. And whether it's appropriate or not for me to say, I, I am still a human being despite being the judge that just happened to inherit this case. [Dana] I can't check that at the door, and I think part of, uh, my job is to have compassion for people and the people that come before me, and to see all sides of the story. And I don't know how anyone can look at this and not feel bad for him. I say Rick shoulda did seven, eight years and been home. Should have been home. 20 years ago. Even my daughters, everybody say, "Yeah, they should let the boy go. He did enough time." Murders ain't-- He did more time than murderers. [foreboding music] [Scott] The leader of the Young Boys Incorporated, Butch Jones, the Henry Ford of heroin as he'd like to call himself, responsible for hundreds and hundreds of kilos of drugs being sold. Responsible for multiple murders, alleged and convicted, did seven years. [Scott] Kurt McGurk was Butch Jones' protégé. A 16-year-old hitman did 25 years. He's out. The Curry Boys. Johnny Curry, Rick's mentor in the game. Arguably the biggest Eastside drug dealer of the 1980s, ran an empire for ten years. Went into prison in 1987. Came out in 1999, 12 years. Nathaniel "Boone" Craft. Here I am. Hitman, murderer, however y'all wanna put it. Admitted to killing 30 people in open court did 17 years, he's out. I'm not in prison no longer. I'm free, and hoping one day y'all will free White Boy Rick. [Chris] What rational human being would say that a man who has admitted 30 execution-style killings, who then cooperates with law enforcement, should get out in 17 years and Richard Wershe, Jr. should be in for 28 years? [Nate] I know I'm going to hell. There's nothing that I could do to change that because my life had so much violence, so much everything but, yet, White Boy Rick is still locked up. [Ralph] The government takes a 14-year-old boy out of high school and places him in imminent peril so that they can do their job. [Ralph] And after they used him up, they kick him to the curb, and send him to jail for the rest of his life. He done served a lot of time for something that he wasn't. Bottom line, for something that he wasn't. What happens if... three, or four, or five, ten years down the road, Rick, you get out of prison? What do you do, then? Start my life over. Try and start from the beginning, you know? I wanna go home, be able to raise my kids, have a family, get a job somewhere, and then lead a normal life. [somber music] [Kevin] Hello. I'm Kevin Dietz with a breaking news story. A decision is in on the Richard Wershe "White Boy Rick" case. The parole board has voted, and they have voted to parole Richard Wershe. He will be freed of his life sentence in prison -in the state of Michigan. -[clapping] Oh, my God! -[clapping] -[chuckles] - Is that it? [Darlene] He did it. [Wershe] The administrative assistant came and called me in the office and- -he basically told me, "Listen, it's over." "You're done. Michigan paroled you." And what did you do? [Wershe] I cried man. I cried. [dramatic music] [splatters]
