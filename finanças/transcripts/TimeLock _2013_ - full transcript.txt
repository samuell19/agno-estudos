How are you today? Fine, thank you. Why didn't you say anything? As soon as I saw him I did. It'll be okay. ♪ Hello, Chelsea. Hello there. I wanted to ask about your safe storage facility. All executive rooms now feature a wall safe. Right, but the problem is it's too small. We have a safe deposit facility. I heard you had a much larger safe for the use of delegates. Yes we do, Sir, but that's reserved by the conference organizers. I'm a delegate. If you want to use it I suggest you speak to the conference team at Delegate Reception. Their office is just inside the concourse of the conference center. Thanks very much, darlin'. See you later. Mr. Kerr? Mr. Kerr, someone's left a bag. Did you see who it was? Yes. It definitely wasn't a guest here. I'd have remembered if he was. Is it this one here? Uh huh. Okay. Can I get a security check from reception about eleven this morning? ♪ There.

Fuck off, Mark. As if you're never late. Have you got my 50 quid? It's coming. Had a bit of bad luck at the club last night. There was I with two aces and two fours, a ten comes up on the river and the squint-eyed asian bitch takes me with a straight flush. Should'a seen it comin', she looked so glazed.

We have golden opportunity here. It's difficult when you're understaffed. And you'll continue to be unless we can improve productivity. What about the new night manager? Head office interviewed two new candidates for the post of night manager, but neither were suitable. So the overtime situation will continue. James has agreed to take Saturday, but we need a volunteer for Sunday night. Come on, don't all volunteer at once. Mark, how about you? Well, I've got plans. Stuart? Well, I'd like to, but I'm going to be working overtime all week at the eh... Gemstone Expo. And with my mother just out of hospital, I really should put in some family time. I suppose that sounds reasonable. Mark? Well, family comes first. I hope your mother's not too ill. It's not life threatening... ...unfortunately. But, I really need to play that tournament. Mark? Mr. Kerr? Am I disturbing you? Not at all, Chelsea. What is it? We just had a complaint through from room 69, about loud noises in room 70. Noises? What kind of Noises? Grunting noises. There's not really a lot we can do, if guests are getting frisky in the middle of the afternoon. Room 70 is supposed to be unoccupied. Ah. Hotel Security. Open the door, please. Mark. What? What's going on? I could ask you the same thing. Eric... I think I can handle this. Who've you got in there? Maria! She's only 17! She's Russian. You know company policy. You could be sacked for this. She was well up for it. Listen, ask nicely, she might let you have a wee ride at her. I'm responding to a formal complaint from guests. Just say it was a false alarm. The pipes or something. Eric won't say anything. Pipes? What about Maria? Why the hell didn't you go to another hotel? Come on Mark, it doesn't have to be like this. We're pals. Maria, are you decent? I think you better get your clothes and get back to work. So are we okay? This time. She wants to work room service now. She'll get good tips there. I mean... ...promotion is a good solution. Thanks, Mark. I owe you one. Yes, in fact you do. All right. Splashing out. Well, let's go. - Hi there. - Hi. Uh, just a 150, please. Thanks.

Looking for action. Well neither am I. Look, I don't have any money. I lost it all in there. Of course you did. That's why we're here. What do you mean? Is your name Mark Edward Kerr? What is this? We'd like to ask you a few questions. About what? About some photographic equipment. Boiled sweet? You know I used to hate these things, but they're... ...really not all that bad. Look, aren't you going to ask me some questions? Well, why don't you start by telling us what's been going on? You need to read me my rights first. I think you've been watching too much TV, Mark. I haven't arrested you. Yet. But you are planning to. Depends on what you say. Okay, what do you want to know? Now, that's more like it. Isn't it Joe? Look if you want me to talk please don't patronize me, with your fake pal act. I don't think you are listening to me, Mark. It's you who needs to want to talk to us. Well maybe we should just talk down at the station then. Okay... ...but here's the thing, Mark. We aren't the police. What? Who the hell are you then? How can you arrest me? Come on, calm down Mark. Calm down. We don't want to arrest you. that's the whole point. My name is Frank Boyd. This is Joe Hardy. We're PI's working for the Gilmartin Hotel Group. We're investigating a series of thefts at the hotel. Now you can make this easy on yourself. Or we can get the police to arrest you. Okay. So when did this all start? Just recently. Don't' try to fool me, Mark. Three years ago. That's a lot of cameras. - People are careless. - Oh, you're right there. So what else are you into, Mark? What do you mean? Stock theft? Bogus overtime payments? Cash back fraud? - No! I think you're lying there, Mark. See, the financial team have picked up on a number of irregularities over the last six months. I mean, why do you think we were called in? So who's helping you, Mark? What about your wife? Is she taking the bookings? Is she dirty-- Just leave her out of it. I'd like to believe you there, Mark, but, see, my experience tells me it's either you... ...or someone working with you. So who else has got an expensive pastime? Look, I'm not doing anything except the lost property scam. I swear. Yeah, we'll see. Stuart. Stuart... Stuart Riley, Events Manager. Sure, no kidding. He likes to live it up. So do you, Mark. What can you offer me? Like to bargain, eh Mark? Well if you help us we can offer you a chance to resign, get another job, turn your hand at something else. Okay. But I don't know anything about any cash back fraud. So you say but, I mean... how can we prove this? There's a log at the hotel. It details every hour every manager works. Well, let's see this log. It's at the hotel. - Well let's go. - Now? Yeah, now. A lot less embarrassing that way. And just remember, everyone's under investigation. What are you doing here? I thought you were at the club. Yeah I never made it. There's a big IT problem. These guys are here to sort it out. I haven't noticed anything wrong. That's Trojans for you. It's like untrustworthy staff. You never know there's a problem until it's too late. Know what I'm saying? - I suppose so. Look, there's no point in both of us hanging about here. Why don't you just head off, see if you can make that engagement? Thanks, man. That's another one I owe you. Cheers! No problem. Seems like a nice guy. You think. These are the logs here. Where's the operator? It's not manned at night. Well, I'll check. What's going on here? Nothin'. Who are you? This is a robbery, isn't it? Stop 'em recording. Give me the disk. It's an external hard drive. Then rip it out. Do it. How long does that record? A month. Done? Show me. Show me the safe. Show me the safe. Do it. Don't look at him. Open it. Open it. - I can't. I know you know the code. Yeah, I do... ...but it's on a time lock. It doesn't open until eight o'clock. You lying piece of shit. Open it! I'm telling the truth. They had it installed years ago-- - The code! - I'm telling you, it doesn't-- - Open it! - I can't. Look. You think I didn't know about the time lock. Why did you think we picked tonight? It's a bank holiday tomorrow. That means the day shift comes in an hour later, but the old time lock stays the same. Am I not right? You're well informed. I'm a good guesser, Mark. And now, thanks to you, I know the code. Three - seven - nine - six. You know what that means. That's not the right code. It's not the right code. Well... ...I'm just going to have to believe you... ...this time. Right, you take his head. Take his head! Don't-don't you dare. Don't you fucking dare. Take his shoulders. Take his shoulders! Come on. Under the shoulders. Take his head. Out! Had you known him long? You fucking idiot! All you had to do was punch in a few numbers. Imagine getting fucking killed by a fucking mug like you. You go and fuck everything up. Don't you look at me. Face the wall. What's that? It's the front desk. It means there's a problem. You just hit 'Enter' to look at the cameras. Just cycle through them. Show me. Show me! Who's this joker? That's Donald. He is the night porter. He's got to report any problems to the Duty Manager. Please don't hurt him. He's not in very good health. Well, you're gonna make him go away. Good evening, Mr. Kerr. I thought it was Mr. Stuart in tonight. There's an IT problem and Mr. Stevens asked me to oversee it. No one tells me anything. You know you have something red on your sleeve? It's just a leaky pen. Is everything okay? It's these drunk kids again. Pissing in the flowerbeds, disgusting little shits. I banged on the window, but I think we should phone the police. They're just drunk. It's the same ones trying to get back at me. We don't want to be too heavy handed. They're still out there, smoking joints up on the bridge. They need to be taught a lesson, the wee buggers. I think I should call-- - No! I mean I understand your concern, Donald, but it doesn't look good for the hotel if we have the police around here. You surprise me, Sir. Former maths teacher... Need to nip these things in the bud. I'm sorry you feel that way, Donald, but we're in the middle of a very serious IT situation here, which could affect the profitability of the hotel. Now I really don't have time to deal with the fallout from a few trampled flowerbeds! Sorry, Sir. Sorry to have troubled you. That's all right. I appreciate it's difficult sometimes. Any more interruptions you think I should know about? - I hope not. - Yeah, me too. So, you used to be a teacher? Yeah, a long time ago. So, where did you teach? - Nowhere near her. - Where? - Perth. - Perth? You used to have brown hair and wear glasses. I told you I knew you from somewhere. You were a maths teacher. Mr. Kerr, Mistake. - Mistake? - Yeah, your nickname. You were a pupil there? For a time. You don't remember me, do you? - No, I'm sorry. - Sorry? Sad maybe, but not fucking sorry. You all just looked like children, you know. See if this will remind you. I got kicked out of school because of you, Mistake prick! Look, whatever it is that I am supposed to have done, I'm sorry. Well, that's not good enough, is it? You know after I left fucking borstal- fucking special needs school- I used to dream about chopping you up in little cubes. Maybe I should make that come true. Make it come happen. But, you know, then again, I find it fucking kind of funny. Fucking ironic, now that I think about it. You and me back there... and now here. I mean what are the fucking chances? And, well... Well now you're a murderer. I'm not a murderer. So he's just taking a fucking nap, is he? No... Well you killed him. And it's all your fault. So what is it like, eh? What does it feel like to be a killer? What's it like, Mistake, you lazy fucking prick? You fucking murdered him. - I did not. You fucking did. You fucking killed him and you fucking murdered him. Now face the fucking wall before I fucking murder you! What the fuck?! Sorry to disturb you again, Mr, Kerr, Sir. The room service have reported a disturbance in the Oceanic Suite. I thought the bar was closed. Mr. Riley, it seems, forgot to lock up. The girls are scared. - What's up? Two delegates from the Jewelry Expo. Very drunk and abusive. Can you handle it? I might be a bit heavy handed, Sir, and I should not leave reception unattended. Okay, just a second. Do we have a choice? - You sent Stuart home. - No, you sent him home. I'll be one step behind you. Donald, this is Frank Boyd from IT headquarters. He's here to deal with the network problem. Look, maybe it would be better if you go back to your desk and we'll take it from here. - Hi, Maria. - Mr. Kerr. Oh, uh, his is Frank Boyd from head office, uh... I don't think you know each other. Pleased to meet you. Any more of that and you're both dead. Hey, where's your holiday spirit? No... No! What's the problem? I'm a good looking guy and I'm loaded. There's a big problem. You're a fucking prick tease, Ronnie, and you know it! I told you, cough up a ring and I cough up the vagina. Excuse me, this is a hotel. Oh, you're hot, baby. You're hot. Get your hands off me! Fucking hell. Oy, pardon me. We're fucking guests in this shit hotel. Hey, can we just calm down? I'm the Night Manager. You say you're guests here? Yes, we are paying guests. Get your hands off me. Okay. Could you please... ...go up to your room now? I want a drink. Use the minibar. He's already drunk the minibar dry. I invited him up and he went crazy. And he couldn't keep his hands off me. She's a horn pot, you know. Just tell me the number. I'll have the minibar refilled. I don't want to say it in case he overhears. So he's not a guest? Of course I'm a guest. I booked the fucking room! Okay. Well could you please go up to the room now? No, I'm not sharing the room with that sack of shit! Hey, if anyone is sleeping outside tonight it's you, you tight-fannied bitch. I want you to call the police. Look, there's no need for that. He won't take no for an answer. You want it and you know it. - Just shut it! - Please, Frank. Just let me handle this. - Well, deal with it. Maria, maybe you could escort this guest up to her room, and we could open the bar for this gentleman. Maybe get him a nightcap. It's a bank holiday after all. See, that's more like it, now. He's not coming up! I'll come up if I want to! Nobody will disturb you. How about a wee fucking drinky? Okay, but I don't drink brown, only vodka. Tell you what. Why don't we do a wee screwdriver with a twist? No, no, no, hold the O.J. O.J. Now there's a fella who knew how to treat a woman. ♪ I'm a fucking guest! ♪ Going somewhere? I just felt a bit sick. Don't be such a pussy, eh? Let's go. Why did you take his wallet? Because I hate loud-mouth pricks like that almost as much as I hate ex-teachers. You see they get a bit of money and then they turn into fucking Tories. So I hit them where they don't like it and take their cash, weak bastards that they are. Know many people in Glasgow, do you? Mistake, too many questions. Are you a slow learner or what? The only inside man is your bad karma. You got into all this shit... ...because you weren't paying attention. So... ...you fancy Maria, do you? Ya dirty old man. No. It's nothing like that. Oh, 'course not. You want to shag her. Not everybody thinks that way. Oh yeah? So, what gets you off? What gets me off? Yeah. You know... No. What turns a man like you on? Well, there's poker. Oh, yeah? So how does poker make you feel? Well, it's fun. It's exciting. Oh, poker? Is that all you've got in your life. I mean... ...what does Mrs. Kerr do? Is she not putting out or something? Oh, she's not, is she? Okay gambling. What's that all about? I don't get it. No you don't. You really don't. Well tell me. It's not just fun, is it? No, it's exciting. So is stealing. It's not the same. Poker makes me feel in control. What about when you lose? Even then. Why? I... I like the idea of working out probability. It's like I can see the equations in front of me. Then why do you always get it wrong? I don't always get it wrong. I'm on a bad streak. What, a bad streak! I thought it was all about the maths. A bad streak is about maths. It's the law of large numbers. Well, maybe you're not as good at maths as you think you are. Maybe. Hey, don't try to give me an answer you think I want to hear. Fuck's sake. I want to know the truth. I dunno... Come on, Mistake, I'm getting bored, and when I get bored I get twitchy. You know what I'm saying? Dig? Okay, okay. I guess... it's not just being in control. It's adrenalin. It's like there's a devil out there and I can feed him just enough to keep him at bay. Do you understand? - Nah! Chance, chance is for losers. You want something, why not take it? And I'm not talking about fucking lost property either. You know the difference between me and people like you is that you go to bed dreaming about what I do. I want something, well I take it. But you're a criminal. Oh yeah... ...and what are you, Mistake? Can I ask you something? Depends what it is. What's your plan? Plan? Yeah. What, with the gold? None of your business. No, I don't mean the gold. I mean you get the safe open at eight o'clock... ...then what? Well, what would you do? What would I do? Well, I guess if you're asking what I'd do in your situation. First I'd be looking to lie low for a while. Then I'd be looking to go to another country. One that didn't have an extradition treaty with the UK. Somewhere like Brazil or Cambodia. And I'd be looking to travel by rail or by sea mostly because obviously airports can be difficult. So I was just wondering... ...how are you planning to get out of the country? Well I'll do that. One of them. That sounds good. You see... That sounds to me... ...like you haven't thought about this. It sounds to me like you haven't planned anything. It seems to me that... ...you don't know what you are gonna do with whatever is in that safe. Is that true? What? Well, you say I'm a nobody and that I should just walk in and take it. But what are you doing? If you want to keep whatever is in that safe... ..where are you gonna go? Enough. You haven't thought about this, have you? You say I'm a loser... ...but why have you not made a plan? Do you want to get caught? - Shut your mouth! You're going to walk out of here with all this money and then what? Just stand at a bus stop and say, "Hey, I've got a lot of money. Can I get on the bus?" - You know who I am. - You want to get caught! You know who I fucking am! - What? - Who am I? - I don't know. - Who am I? - I don't-- - Who am I?! I don't know. Who... am I? You're Callum Coyne. Correct. I knew it. About fucking time. What did I do? You were expelled for being involved in drugs. No! Some ecstasy was found and I was blamed. I had nothing to do with it, and you know it. There were witnesses. Lying bastards both of them. But it wasn't the first time, was it? You were running a drug ring. I just stole some money from the guys who were. And you believed them over me. You ruined my life based on your fucking prejudice. Look. I'm sorry for my part in that, but... ...I wasn't the only one. No, but you knew I wasn't in that morning because I saw you skipping off down to the town center... ...after you'd pulled a sickie. Just because I saw you, doesn't mean you weren't involved. You weren't innocent. But I wasn't a drug dealer. Look... ...the truth is... ...you were a difficult, disruptive pupil. You would have been expelled sooner or later anyway. Why would I stand up for you? Because that was your job. You were supposed to look after kids like us, be a voice- right and wrong. Talk to me about planning. Well you... Well you planned, all right. You thought of yourself. Well now it's time for payback. Give me the code. No. Give me the code. I might be a coward, I might be lazy, but I am not stupid. You'll kill me if I tell you. Oh but you are. You see, you twist everything up in your head and you talk fucking shite. Maybe I should just do the world a favor and kill you now. I mean, answer me this. When I kill you who is gonna miss you? Your friends you lie to? Your family you cheat on? No one. You're already dead. Just four little numbers and it is all over. I'll make it easy on you. I'm not giving you the code... ...but I can give you something else. Well, I'm listening. What can you offer me? Safety deposit boxes. They're in a room behind reception. I can open it. Safety deposit boxes. You're a real fucking disappointment to me, Mark. Where are these safety deposit boxes? Doesn't look very secure to me. The hard part is supposed to be getting through the door.

You go through the underground car park. On the right there's a gate. You go right through it and you're on the expressway. Someone's coming, someone's coming! Clear. Which way? What? - It was Chelsea, wasn't it? She is your girlfriend. - What... The receptionist! You're doing it for her. Take this. If anything happens to me... Right? Okay. Fuck! Police! Armed police! Put the weapon down! Put the weapon down! Okay. Stand up... slowly... ...and come out. Okay. On the ground. Hands on your head! He's got another gun! You'll remember me this time. Is he armed? Where's the gun? Where's the gun?! He's clean. Get him out of here. ♪ ♪ ♪
