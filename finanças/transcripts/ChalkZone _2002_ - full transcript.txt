In a few hours, it'll be Christmas Eve. Where in tarnation is my Santa costume? The Holidaze Costume Company promised me it'd be here last week. Don't worry, Joe. I'm sure it will. Oops. If it doesn't come, you can always wear your old costume. That is my old costume, Millie. ( laughing ): Oh, well. It's probably on its way here now. ( rattling ) Rudy! Are you snooping? Huh? Me? No. Why would I be snooping? MILLIE: Well, maybe you're looking for a special present with your name on it. RUDY: Now what special present would I be looking for? Oh! Oh, maybe that box of expensive artist pens you asked Santa for? Expensive is right. You won't find those pens under that tree. That's for sure. I won't? Oh! I can't believe this. Oh! Neither can I. Oh, it will hardly seem like Christmas Eve. Unless... Unless? Unless I get my Santa suit! Your Santa suit?! Who cares about your Santa suit, Dad? Everybody knows it's you behind the beard with a pillow in your jacket. This whole visit-from-Santa thing is just bogus. Rudy! JOE: Rudy! But you've always loved our Christmas Eve visit from Santa, son. Santa arrives just before the figgy pudding at Christmas Eve dinner. Why, it's a Tabootie family tradition. Santa loves Millie's figgy pudding. ( giggling ): Joe! Well, I don't even like figgy pudding. I think this holidaze season is a bunch of baloney. And I don't care if Santa visits us this year or not. ( Joe and Millie gasping ) I don't care for your attitude, young man. You march yourself upstairs and don't come down until you've got the Christmas spirit. Fine. See you next year! ( door slamming ) ( knocking at door ) Merry, merry, merry! Santa come? Oh, not yet, Sophie, but, uh, he will, he will. Santa come. Santa come! Happy Holidays, Mr. and Mrs. Tabootie. Oh, and thanks for inviting me to join you for your traditional Tabootie Christmas Eve dinner. Well, Penny, thank you for helping watch Sophie while Tillie did the shopping. No problem. And look what we found underneath the hedge outside. ( gasping ) Oh, my gosh! Is it? It is! Santa come? Oh, yes, yes, San... uh, Santa come. Santa come soon. ( whispers ): I got to go try this costume on. Where's Rudy, Mrs. Tabootie? You mean Scroogey? I sent him upstairs for an attitude adjustment. Go see if you can help him get in the holiday mood. Okay. Rudy? ( upbeat music playing, crowd chattering ) Wow. ( laughter and chatter ) Hey, Penny, over here! ( grunts ) Rudy, what's going on here? ( laughs ) Snap says this is the start of the Chalk Zone holiday season. Zoners from all over everywhere kick off the holiday here in All Together Land before they, you know, do their own thing.

What a truckload of joy! I got to get me a JingleBelly Soda. Hey, you guys want anything? No. No, you go ahead. I'm okay. That was great. Yeah. I wish our holidays back home were that much fun. Our holidays are fun, Rudy. In fact, we should be getting back to help get ready for Christmas Eve dinner. Oh, no, you go ahead. I'm staying here. You are? What?! That is so great, bucko. You'll finally be here to see one of Chalk Zone's most amazing spectacles. Rudy, you can't just skip out on your family's traditional meal. Pardon us, but this only happens once a year. So does this! And Santa is coming to visit. Well, this has eight Santas. BOTH: Eight Santas? Sure, it's the annual Santa launch. As you know, kids draw a lot of Santas in the Chalk Zone. MAN: So, what's your route gonna be? MAN #2: Well, they got me going to the Equator again. Uh-huh. Lot of traffic over there, you better watch it. Yeah, but I got the new sled, so... Oh, do you? Yeah. What, the S-5000? SNAP: And they all expect to deliver presents on Christmas Eve. Imagine the Christmas chaos if all those Santas just started flying every which way. It's up to the Society of Elves to keep things in order. I myself, happen to be an apprentice elf. You're going to become an elf, Snap? If they'll have me. You know, elves get first dibs on all the candy. And that means I and guests of my choosing get to be up in the VIP lounge for the big launch of the Santa Squadron. They're the best seats in Chalk Zone. Oh, going up? You bet! Um, but... Penny? Well, it does sound like a fascinating display of aeronautical prowess. But we have to be back in time for your family's... ( Joe screaming ) JOE: Millie, get up here, quick! What is it, Joe? ( screams ) The Hol-Hol-Holidaze Company made a t-t-terrible mistake. Oh, Joe. What's all the shouting about? Oh! Don't look at me! I don't want anyone to see me like this! Listen, Joe, I was just about to take Sophie down to Toy Mania to sit on Santa's lap. Why don't you come along... Yes! There's still hope. Maybe I can still find a Santa suit somewhere. I'll take off my cotton tail and be right with you. This equipment is impressive. Better than anything we have in the real world. Uh-huh-huh. T-minus three minutes, everybody. Set your sleigh-o-meters for impending launch velocity. General Elvis, sir, these are my friends I was telling you about. Yes, yes, creator and friend, that's fine. Don't anybody touch anything. Activate the reindeer antler antennas, man. ( whirring ) Your equipment is so sophisticated, General Elvis. Oh, thank you, little lady. Thank you very much. Don't touch anything! Do the Santas pick their own delivery routes, General? Or do you assign... What?! Pick their own routes? Are you mad? This central console contains the flight plans for every Santa in the squadron. No Santa knows his route until after the launch when the flight plans will be beamed into the flight plan-o-meters in their sleighs. T-minus one minute, man. Lieutenant Google-Eyes, start the countdown. TCB. 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42... Oh, isn't this fascinating? Yeah! Fascinating? This is unbeliev-abulous. Wait till you see! ...12, 11, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. ELVIS: And we have launch! ELF: Off they go! ( all screaming ) RUDY: Look out, look out! PENNY: Wow! Did you see that? SNAP: Did you feel that? ( all oohing and aahing ) ( laughing ) It is time to send the Santa Squadron their flight instructions, man. Activate plan-o-meters. See, Penny? Our real-world holidays are nothing compared to this. ( all screaming ) Oh, no! ( firecrackers whistling ) ( beeping ) This ain't New Year's Day. This is Santa six. I'm having a problem. Ho-ho-holy moley! I've lost control of my sleigh! ( all screaming ) New Year's Day! New Year's Day! ( screaming ) ( screaming ) ( screaming ) ELVIS: Look what you have done! What will happen to Chalk Christmas now? Oh, man, I'm all shook up. You're upset, aren't you? Uh, does this mean I don't get to join the Society of Elves? I'll take that as a "no." I'm so sorry. I'll fix it, I promise. He's got the chalk, you know. That's right. ( chuckles ) Rudy's got the chalk. Yeah, and, and where there's a chalk, there's a way. ( groaning ) ( groaning ) Oy, galoy, this is terrible! How are we ever gonna set it right? ( sirens ) Hold it! Owie. Sorry. Okay, the first thing we have to do is rescue all the Santas and tend to their injuries. You, clowns, lift that sleigh and pull out Santa number five. Penny, start bandaging Santa number three. Snap, untangle those reindeer. Aye, aye, bucko. You got it, Rudy. Santas, listen up! We're going to get you out of there! Santas? Santa? There's Santa. Oh, no, Sophie. That's just a mechanical Santa, kind of a toy. SOPHIE: Santa toy? Come on, come on. There's got to be a costume place somewhere. There's somebody who might be able to help. ( car door closes ) Excuse me, sir. But I couldn't help noticing your outfit and I... I told you guys, I would pay for it at the end of the day! Will you stop hounding me? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on there. I just want to... How many times do I have to tell you? This is my corner! Now make like a reindeer and fly! Back off, belly boy! I'm making a list! Yeah, well, I'm checking it twice! There's Santa? JOE: No, sweetie, those are just a couple of creeps. SOPHIE: Santa creeps? WOMAN: Paging Dr. Bedford, paging Dr. Bedford. PENNY: Can you really get all the Santas and sleighs back to flying shape before Chalk Christmas is over, Rudy? I hope so. ELVIS: You must, man! The toys, the presents, they must be delivered. Zoners everywhere are counting on it.

( record scratches, music stops ) Listen to me. You can't give up on Christmas. We can still make it happen if we stick together. General Elvis, can you recover the flight plans from your computers? Well, maybe, but I'm going to need me a volunteer to climb inside the console and clean up the mess. I'll volunteer. After all, it was my JingleBelly soda. Good! I'll repair the sleighs with this. Now, I'm just looking for a few good Santas to pilot those sleighs. Who's with me? I'm with you! Heck, I can pilot one of those things with both arms in a sling. I'm in. Me, too. ( laughter ) That's the spirit! We must never give up on Christmas. JOE: I give up. That's all there is to it. I'm giving up. Oh, no, Joe. I couldn't find a you-know-who outfit anywheres, Millie. And after what Sophie saw tonight, I'm afraid she'll never believe in Santa Claus. Well, then she and Rudy will make the perfect team. ( gasps ) Is he still up there brooding? Well, that's enough of that. Rudy! 'Tis the season to be jolly! General Elvis, the fleet is ready for relaunch. That's pretty good, man. Snap is just completing the cleanup as we speak. Oy, galoy! ( groaning ) ( lisping ): General Elvis, this console is now completely soda free. All right! It looks like Chalk Christmas is back in business. Okay, Santas, let's call the roll. Santa, one for the money. Yo! Santa, two for the show. Yo ho ho. Great work, Rudy. Santa three to get ready. Yo ho ho! I had to do it. I couldn't ruin Christmas for everybody. Right. And now we've got to get back home and do the same for Christmas at your house. Santa eight? Where's Santa eight? ( muffled ): In here, in here! I'm in here! Oh, my gosh. ( shivering ) Great gumballs, he's frozen solid! It'll take hours to thaw him out. And Santa eight has one of the biggest regions, man. Who will deliver these presents now? Not me. No way, man. We're late as it is. Yeah, I'm already late as it is. I got more than I can handle. I'll take over for Santa eight! Come on, come on! Let's get Chalk Christmas on the ro-ho-oad. Are you sure you can do this, Rudy Tabootie? Somebody has to, but I could use an elf as an assistant. All right, man. I hereby appoint you... Hyah! Hyah! Ho ho ho! ...a member of the Society of Elves so that you may accompany Santa Rudy on his rounds. Whoo, whoo-whoo, whoo-whoo! Ha ha! Whoo hoo hoo! Yeah, man! Santa Squadron, prepare for launch, man. ELVIS: Ready? But what about... Set. ...your family's... Launch! ...traditional Christmas Eve dinner?! ( sighs ) RUDY: Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! Whoa! ( screaming ) Now come on, son. I'm not playing games. Either you open this door on the count of three, or I'm coming in! One, two, three! Oh, hi, Mr. Tabootie! Rudy is hard at work on, uh, an extra special holiday surprise. A surprise? Yes, come on. Let's, um, sing "The 12 Days of Christmas." RUDY: Ho-ho-ho! SNAP: There you go! Okay, that takes care of the Wait and Sea. Where do we go next? ( bell tower ringing ) The flight plan calls for a big drop-off at those chimneys. How can we tell which presents go where?

Ugh, at least they're getting what they want. ♪ Five golden rings! ♪ Santa come? Not yet, Sophie. But I wish Rudy would get down here! This surprise he's working on better be good.
