Freeka! Where are you? We have to find Freeka. You ready? Yeah. Are we going over that mountain? That snow mountain? - Yeah. - I guess it's gonna be slippy. Whew. Is your nose runny? - You okay? - Yeah. - Can you make it? - Yeah. - Should we keep going? - Yeah. Okay. - Do you want to have a drink? - No. Are you... are you saying conclu... conclusion much? Ah! I'm not a good leader. - Yeah, you are. - Ah! - I got ya. I'm right behind you. - See, I told you. - All right. - I'm not a good leader. I know that was the mountain I was looking at. I'm too tired to ch... tell a story. It has to be a short one. It's okay, you can go to sleep. What? Why are you sad? I'm not sad. But why do you look sad? Uh, I'm not. But I see your face is a little wet, because you have tears. I'm just happy you're here with me. - If we see what? - Goblins! If you see goblins... Kill them! - And how are we gonna kill them? - With our swords. That's it. Freeka Reeka Sheeka Deeka is on the mountain. Really? What was she doing there? She just wanted to have a like whole day. Mark and Bodhi, they were looking for Freeka Reeka Sheeka Deeka. Yes! But why are they looking for Freeka Reeka Sheeka Deeka? They were looking for those surprises. Sometimes I imagine I'm a teeny tiny person and I'm walking through these trees. Yes. These big trees, and that's the little trees. And like we could have a little house right there on that hill. And we can live there forever. Daddy? We're not finished yet. Now you're dead. Nope, I made it back to Earth. Then you're never gonna come back to life again. If you're on Earth, you're the... you're dead. So you're dead. I'm dead. Buddy, I don't really like playing games about being dead. But I want to play the games about being dead with you. What do you think happens when we die? No, we're just pretending! Don't talk about real dying. That make me really sad. Okay, I'm sorry. Now my fuel tank's broken. Now keep playing the game! Okay, let's keep playing the game. I don't think we have much time actually. Really? How much time do you think we have? 59. Oh, no, actually one minute. - One minute? - Yeah. One minute left until what? Until we go back into the fairy house. How are we gonna get there? I guess we're never gonna be able to. We're lost. I know. I don't like being lost. Me either. Hey, I have an idea to get back to the fairy house. Ah! Whoosh! Are you ready to begin this mission? Yes, I'm ready for the mission. - This one is from... - Um, oh, wait, hold on. - I don't think... - Minnow. Here. You have to get rid of all of your baggage. - Really? - Yes, that's right. "Dear Bodhi, happy birthday. We are so happy to be here with you celebrating your birthday." All right, should we put the ones... Can we do this? Ah. Ah. - That one? - Let's open this one first - 'cause Bodhi chose this one. And then we'll... - So, yeah. Oh, my goodness, what is this? - A lunch bot, a... - Oh! - Whoa! Cool! - Oh, we need that! - A robot! - And it's a robot, Bodhi. It's a robot lunchbox. - And, uh... - A robot lunchbox? They're the forest ones I really wanna keep, let him open. - What about we... Dad... - Here, Bodhi? - Bodhi, come here, sit on my lap, mister. - Dad... - And we can open this one. Bodhi! Bodhi! - Whoa, look! Look... - Bodhi! - What? - Whoa! - It's for Bodhi! - I know! - No, no, no, this is to Bodhi from Pacey. - Pacey. - Pacey. Pacey. Right there. - Whoa! Slime! - Slime kit. - Guys, it's slime. - Oh, wow. - What's a slime? - That's a slime from who? - Minnow. - It's a slime-making kit. - From Minnow. - From Minnow. - It's a little kit! Come on! Come on! I'm so happy that you guys finally are here. - Happy birthday! - Ton... Tonkees? - This is... - Birthday. - Henry and Chapel - Thank you. Thank you. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. - And this was all in here, right? - And this is from... - Happy birthday. - Thank you, thank you. And what... and what else is that? Dinosaurs. Thank you, thank you, thank you! - A matching memory game. - Happy birthday! Thank you! Ah! - What do you think it is? - A little kissy. Ah. Ah! No! Ah! I love you to the moon, to the stars... - All the way down... - All the way down to the... - The popcorn. - Popcorn? Listen. These are fizzle berries. Hear them popping. - Can we try some? - Of course you can. But you mustn't eat too many. I've never had a fizzle berry before. Yum. Is it sweet? Sweet. I'm gonna do this. Mine's really sour. Ha. - Eat it? - Ugh. Bodhi? Daddy? Daddy? Daddy? Daddy? Daddy? Daddy? He's just taking a quick trip. He'll be back with us in no time, okay? Bodhi? All right, Daddy. You believe in magic, don't you? Close your eyes. And now say shaba laba ding dong. - Shaba laba ding dong. - Perfect. - So... - I can actually do it. - So don't, but... - Stink! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I have butt cheeks! - Oh, I smell fart! - Butt cheek! - Oh! - Bodhi! Oh, my God! He just literally farted on my face. Can I see your face... - Stop it! - Is it scratchy? Do I look like a different person? But you sound like the same guy. 'Cause, I'm the exact same dad that I've always been. But you are not the right person. Oh, no! Oh, no! Boy. I told you to, I have to go off by myself! Why do you want to go off by yourself? Because you said. - Up. - What are you doin'? That's like crunching me. Okay. Now can you push the... the lie down one? Oh, yeah, that's good. Now I'm laying down more. But I need to be lifted back up. You know how you made it go all the way down to the ground? Can you make it come back up? No, no, no, that's taking me down. The other down arrow one. Mm. Oh. I don't want to play this game. I, I don't want to play this game either. I just want you to put it me laying down. Yes! Thank you. There we go. See? All right. Where are we? My friends, welcome to The Forest. My God. It feels really nice to just hear about regular stuff. It has been so heavy over here, but not in any intentional way. 'Cause I feel like Mark is so... tapped into something otherworldly right now. He's in a really beautiful place of acceptance. Um, and I'm really pretending that I'm in a place of acceptance. So my every day is just... like running on adrenaline and trying to keep everything together. Um, so honestly, I don't know how I'm feeling. I don't know if I'm gonna really know how I'm feeling until he's gone, because I'm just doing that thing that I have done my whole life, you know, that survival thing that you do too. How much does he know? - Uh... - Smash! Do you want to go up my arm? Can you go up like this? Once there was a family of fairies that lived in this house many, many years ago. I was having dinner one night right in front of their fireplace, when they heard a big nasty growl outside their door. - Ah! Oh, my God! - Hey! Hey! Cato! Cato! Grumblers. They're big hairy creatures with long snouts. - Awful creatures. - Not sad story. Dada, Santa built this so well, didn't he? Yeah, didn't he? Yeah, he's a really good builder. He's an amazing builder. I'm so glad Santa really knew what he was doing. It's not clunky or wobbly at all. No. Grumblers... ripped the roof off. They attacked the fairies and ate them. That's why Grumblers to this day are feared by all fairies. I'm gonna kill the Grumblers. I don't like it. You don't like Grumblers? Nobody can killed all fairies. I don't like this story. I know. I don't like this story either. Even if he wanted to be my friend, I would say no. And what would you say to him? Why would you not be his friend? Because he would just kill me. Oh, of course. What do you think happens though, if you got killed? What would happen to you? You never come back to life again. Where would you go though? Nowhere. You think you just kind of stay? When you die, you just sort of stay there? You know what's so funny? Your grandpa believes that when you die, that you just turn into the ground, you turn into earth, and you go back into the earth. And then your nana thinks that when you die, you go up into the sky and you meet your creator. - And your creator's name is? - God. God. I think you've been talking to Nanny. And then you go to a place called Heaven, where lots of people are. And you see all your family and friends that have died before you, and you get to go meet them there. And when I was a little girl, that's what Mommy used to believe in too. I believe in something a little bit different now. Bodhi, what do you think that picture is? Angels. Angels and who else? Um, is that dad? Good luck, warriors. Goodbye. Daddy! Hey, Papa. - Did you have a bad dream? - Yeah. Aw. Mama here. I love you, buggy. Dad, I'm saying this way! Let's go this way! Okay, go through there. I'm gonna find you, Freeka! Which way do you want to go? That way. And then we fell into a poop world. A poop world? - Uh-huh. - Ugh. - You smell that? - Yeah. Ew. Hoo-ee! Is that called the Milky Way? No! That is Uranus. You're right. You might be right about that. Shush. - Shush! - I'm not laughing. - Yeah, I'm not laughing. - I'm not laughing. - Stop it. - No, I'm not laughing. - No. I was actually thinking that was so cool that you knew that. Yeah, that it's Uranus. Ugh. - Ah! - What? We're gonna have to cross this farting swamp, son. Let's go. Ew! - Bodhi - Ah! - What? - Mommy's crying from happiness about just like how smart you are. - Stop laughing! - Oh, I'm not laughing. - Okay. - Buddy, you know why we're laughing? - Why? Do you know that another word for your butthole... Is your anus? Do you know that, okay so you know what bumhole means? Bodhi? You know that butt... Bodhi, it's just, it's... - Yeah! - I don't want to eat poop. - Ugh! - Ugh! Ugh! - Mm. - Yummy! Yeah. - Ha, ha. It's chocolate! - Yeah. You think it's funny to steal chocolate? We didn't know it was your chocolate. I'll be watching you. All right, buddy. Here you go. Mommy will open it for you. He's feeling warm. - Ah! Is it off? - No. Where's the rest? There, there, there, there, and there. Oh, no. Well, let me get yours off. Come over here. Mm. - Ah! - Hey. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Are you sure? Okay. Smile. It's us. Hmm. Why are we so sad? Let's get out of here. I guess they're haunted. That way. "Heather is never only heather, as moor is never merely moor. Ever lain down in heather, got its measure, seeing how it shares its weather with Asphodel and bilberry, crowberry, and cotton grass grows together with tormentil's flower, mosses cushion, lichen's feather?" "Hold a heart full of heather, never let it wither, even as you travel far from crag and river." "Remember heather, the company it keeps, its treasure." Bodhi? Hey, Bodhi? Bodhi? Bodhi? Bodhi? Bodhi? Stay right here. We're gonna be okay. Dad! Dad! What's happening? Magic. - I'm scared! - It's okay. It's okay. Hey. How'd you make that light come out of your hands? I don't know. Bodhi has magic. So that's why I used my instructions to like remember that I have magic. Does magic come out of your hands? - Mm-hmm. - It does, huh? Can you use your magic hands on me right now? But my instruction says can only, but I can't do the magic on people. - So that's w... - I think you can. I think if you put one of your magic hands right here on daddy's chest, it'll help me feel better. Can you put it right here? And it didn't work. It didn't work. What, let's just play... just do the rest of the story. Okay, so... Am I dreaming? I hope so. It's good to dream. You know what I was just dreaming about? - What? - Donuts. I want donuts. Should we go find some donuts? - Yeah! - Okay. Look! It's snow! What? - Wow. - Snow! - Oh, no. - But look. I have the biggest ball! - Ah! Ya! - Oh. Ah! Oh. That's it. Ba-pa! - Ah! - Hey! - I hate you! - Why? Because you just did that. Oh! What's so easy in the evening by the morning... seems insane. If you promise to stay conscious, then I will try and do the same. We might die through medication, but it sure kills the pain. Are you a witch? Yes. Are you good or are you bad? Mostly good. But we have a little bit of bad in all of us. It's magic. The thing that you saw was your fears taking shape and growing. They will continue to grow, but so will you. Keep asking questions. Where's Freeka Reeka Sheeka Deeka? You know. - Argh! - One... Two, three, four, five. - 22, 23... - Right. - 24. Ready or not, here we come! - Here I come! On fire! The fireman pirate! Fireman pirate. Where are you? Are you in here? - No. - Are you over here? - Yeah! - Ah! - Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! - Ah! - It's okay, I'm just good. - Oh! - No, don't! - What? He's good. Daddy! We're not finished yet. Quick! Quick! Get up here. Look! Windsor Castle. Let's mount it. Uh, ow, ow, ow. We can. - We got it though. - But now it's gone. - That's okay. - That is okay. Ah! Somebody's shaking on your castle. That might be a monster. I'm so excited for it to rain tomorrow! There's gonna be sun and rain and a rainbow! We'll go up. - Is that really true? - Yes. - You know, I was thinking about something. - What? When I'm gone... - And you die? - Yeah. I want you to know that I'm always gonna be with you in your heart. Will I ever see you again? When you die? Well... you know, bud... I'll always be in your heart. But I want you to be with me. Well, I'm here with you right now. I don't want you to die. You know, dying's part of life. But I don't like life then. Then I don't like life, I don't. You know, I will always be in your heart. - Well... - And in your mind. It doesn't matter 'cause I want to see you, and I can't see you in my mind or my heart. - Do you see anyone coming? - No. How long do you think we should wait here? I guess we have to wait here a googol. - How long's a google? - It's super long. It's a one and then so many zeros. What are we waiting for? We're waiting for people. Do you see a dragon? Yeah. Right there! - Dad! - What? That dragon you could never ride on! - Why? - Because it has fire all over it. I see. That is the dangerous, it's... if you come near it or drive it, or do anything with it, he'll kill you. I'll never ride that dragon. Kill him! - No. - Yes. If you don't kill him, he's gonna kill you! And me. If... if we don't kill him, he's gonna kill us. Ya! Hi-ya! Hi-ya! Hi-ya! I hear a person. - Uh-oh, we need to save that person. - Yell... - Yell who goes down there. - Who's down there? Ah! I'm gonna kill you! Ah! No, no, no, no, no! No, no, please, wait, please! Please wait, I beg you, please, sir, show me mercy, please, no! - This might be it. - Okay. - The big battle. - Yeah. No, please! Wait, wait, wait, wait! - Are you ready? - Hold on! Hold on! - Yeah. - Ah! Now we have to go kill the bad. - Are you ready for that? - Yes. - Okay. - No, wait! - Do it. - Wait! Please! I beg you! I beg you mercy! Please, mercy! - Sword up. - Let's do it. Ah! Ah! No, no, no, no, no! No, no, please, wait, please! Please wait, I beg you, please, sir, show me mercy! Please, sir, no! I'm gonna, ah! Ah! Oh! Ugh, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Hold on! Hold on just one second! - What is he doing? - Ah! Ah! Ugh! Ah! I am gonna strangle you until your very last breath! No! Ugh! Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Hold on! Hold on just one... I think we should help him. Ah! Ah! Ah! I am gonna strangle you! - I'm gonna kill you! - Do you want to help him? - Yes. - No! Please! Ugh! - All right, let's put our swords away. - Oh, no! - Please, please! - Come on, Dad. - Please! Please! - All right. Please just let me be, please! Ah! Take your last, ugh, breath! No! Ah! Ah, I'm telling you, please just hold on! Ah! Just hold on, please! No more, please, no more, no, no! Oh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ah! No, I can't, I can't handle any more. That's it, stop! Please! Please! Please! Oh! Oh! No, no, okay! Don't come any closer! Oh! No! Ugh! Ah! Ugh! Oh! It's okay! I've got it. I've got it. I've got it. I'm sorry you guys had to see that. Why are you hitting yourself? It's because I fight myself all the time. - Oh. - I'm my biggest enemy. You gotta do it. I'm trying to find the right time. I don't know if there ever really is a... a right time. Well, there's a wrong time and it's never. Yeah, I'm gonna. Yeah, we don't talk about the things we're gonna do, we just do 'em. I'm not saying it's gonna be easy. But it's not about you. Dad, don't fall off! Don't look at the edge! - Don't! - I'm not on the edge. I'm okay. - Don't worry about me. - You are on the edge! Well, I really want to snuggly cuddly with you, bud. Get your hair out of my spot. My hair? My hair's up here. But I see your hair! I'm not allowed to see any of your body! All right. We're not playing a game, guys. You can be strong. Just be strong, okay? - No! - Deep breath. Be strong. You're very strong. - Deep breaths. - No. Deep breaths. You're so strong. You're the strongest boy. The strongest boy I know. Get away! Don't need love! I don't need love. - Yes you do. - I don't! - Yes you do! - I don't! Dad, just please don't give me any right now. I'm not in the mood for it. I love you. Don't give me love. Otherwise I'll strangle you if you give me love. Do you want to be strangled? No. Then don't give me love. Just one hug? No! Never! No! You're making this all up. No I'm not. You are not sick! You're making this all up, Daddy. I see the whole world in your eyes. And I see nothing in your eyes. Nothing. Stop! Listen to me. Bodhi, there's light in your eyes. There isn't. You're making this all up. Will you stay here with me? Save him before he freezes. I think he is snow sick. If we bring him home, it'll be nice and warm. I don't think he's gonna make it. Maybe we should bury him. But it's really cold under there. Yeah. I'm afraid... I think he's already dead. Are you getting sick, Mommy? - No, buddy. - Because you're coughing. I've just got a cold, sweetheart. But a cold is sick. Yeah. It's not so sick that it's scary sick. It's just sick like how you get colds, and your friends at school get colds. But it's not like really sick. Then let's keep on reading. "Bluebell. Blue flowers as the blue hour. Late daylight in a bluebell wood, under branch, below leaf. Bluebell blue, so deep, sea deep. Each step is taken in an ocean." This is your rock now. Bodhi's rock. - Thanks, Daddy. - You're welcome. Now everybody will know that it's my rock. "Blue flows at the blue hour. Color is current undertow. Enter the wood with care, my love. Lest you're pulled down by the hue, lost in the depths, drowned in blue." I'm right here. - And you know where I am? - Where? Right here. And I'm right there. - I'm right here. - I love you. Is it cold, Daddy? Are you cold? No. - Okay. - Is my hands cold? They feel a bit cold. Oh. Can we actually stay here because it was too warm? You want to stay here? Forever. - I don't think we can stay here forever. - Why? Here's your phone, Daddy. ♪ The eensy weensy spider Climbed up the water spout ♪ Whoa. Two minutes of bedtime music. Snuggle up, Bodhi. Bodhi? I'm feeling happy. ♪ London Bridge is falling down Falling down, falling... ♪ My favorite animal is a spider! Will you give me a hug? Ah, that was a big one. Oh. Oh. Ah, thank you. Have to get this. Oh, thank you. I feel like a brand new Grumbler. Dad, I'm not done. - Hold still, sweetheart, just like... - I am. Dad, they think we're gonna eat them. Oh, come on, no. Really? We're not gonna eat you. I mean no offense, you do look delicious. What are your names? - My friends call me Morse. - And I'm Boomer. - Oh, God, Boomer! - What? Can you help us find Freeka Reeka Sheeka Deeka? - Oh. - Um... Uh... well, we could lead you to the end of The Forest, uh, - but then you gotta go home on your own. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Gonna have to go home. You want to follow us? I'm gonna go. Do you want to stay here or come with me? Well, I'm following you. All right, let's go. Okay, I'm coming. Going on a treasure hunt. X marks the spot. Dash, dash, dash, and a dot, dot, dot. Tight squeeze, slight breeze. And let the chills run down your back. I'm feeling sad. Will you give me a hug? Thanks. Can you think of something yellow? I'm thinking of the sun. Yellow! I like the sun! I'm feeling happy! Bodhi, show me your biggest smile. Can you think of something orange? I'm thinking of the hearts on my tummy. Orange! Promise me that you'll always be free. Yeah. Daddy's big. Daddy. Dad, can you help me? No, Daddy's tired right now. Mm. - Come on. - Mm. Gotta keep going. Wake up! The battle's happening. Okay? You can suit up over there. Come on. Quick. We gotta go! We gotta go! - Quick! Come on! Come on! - Go, go, go, go! Wood stay. Go, go, go. Shh. They can hear us. Shh. Go! - Hey! Come on, bud! - Go, go, go! Fire! - This is a spooky story, right? - Yeah. - Run, run, run! Go ahead, get in the truck! - Run, run, run! Go, go! Go, go, go! Fire! F... f... fire! F... f... fire! Fire! F... f... fire! Yes! A bad guy! Hey, buddy, don't shoot right now 'cause I can't hear Mommy. What? Say that again. What do you and Bodhi want for dinner? Bodhi, what do you want for dinner? Um... Um, pasta.. I want pasta with no sauce, with cheese, and with, with, um.... - Okay. - Cheese and salt but with no sauce. One time, I found Freeka Reeka Sheeka Deeka, and she told me a secret. That she could turn into anything. You ready? Come on. Okay. Now, first. Your magical knight tunic. Whoosh. Let me see. Perfect. - Are you feeling strong? - Yes. All right. That means you need your sword and shield. - Arm. - A foot! This arm. - Put it through. - Yes. Okay. Do you know how to pull your sword out? Yes. Yes! Amazing. Okay now Daddy's gonna get ready. Okay. Time for Daddy to get ready. Now I will be the Viking Daddy. And now I'll be the Knight in Shining Armor. I need my sword and shield. Now you are the Viking Dad. Are you ready for this mission to begin? Yes, I'm ready for the mission. Ready! Welcome to WAIP Island. - Are you a fairy? - Yes, I am. Come, follow me. Grab my paw! Just swing down. - Whoa! - I got you! Ah, into the hot lava! Here, grab my paw! Oh, I got you. You got it? - All right, I'm gonna go lower. - These are the bravest knights... saving us all from dragons. Ya! Ah! Good job. Oh! But now our mission is gonna begin. You have to wear your special universe top, like Mommy, right? - Yeah! - Check out Mommy's universe top. All right, this is gonna be your warrior protector shirt. Three, two, one. Warrior protector! Arms in. Yeah! - Dada, put your moon jumper on. - I am. I am. Daddy's getting it on. Oh, my gosh! - They're right over there. Oh! - Oh! How are we gonna blast them? How are we gonna blast them? - We can just run over there. - Run over there and do what? - Okay. - Just get them! - I got my blaster. - Right, quick. - I got my blaster. Got my blaster. - Let's! - Let's what? Go! Go, go, go! Fire! They're right there. All right, guys, let's go! Go! Go! - Come on, come on, come on! - That way! That part! - Where? - There! That part! Show me! Show me! - You! - Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Bodhi, wait! You, you go to that part! You go that part! And I go this part! - All right, go! I'll go this way! - All right! Go, go, go! You go that way, and you go that way. - All right. - All right, go. All right, I'm right here. - Fire! - There's one right behind you. Ah! Ah! Ah! He's right behind us. - I see one! - He shot me down! He shot you down. Come on. You can get him. We won't let you win. We will not let you win. - Why? - Ah. Because the good guys always win. Okay. Let's go. Ah, I'm gonna get you! Ah! Good guys always win! Come on, let's blast them. Yaa! You will not defeat us. Hey, Bodhi. Come here. I need to tell you something. - Hey. - What? - I have to tell you something. - What? You know how Daddy's been a little sick? Yeah. Sick. What else? Well, there's different kinds of sick. What kinds? Um, well, there's sick like a cold sick. Yeah. And then sometimes there's like, like really sick. Yeah. What else? Is that it? I need to go and battle robots. So just tell me quickly. Well, that's it, buddy. I... I just, uh, that's it. Okay. Let's go up and shoot robots. Battle these robots. Choo. Mm. Come here. Ah, yeah. - Bye, Bodhi. - Bye, Bodhi. - Bye. - Bye. - Have a lovely journey. - Thank you. You too. Have a lo... lovely journey. Where do we go when we die? I don't know. Where do you think we go? I don't know. Yeah, none of us know. What? Why are you sad? I'm not sad. But why do you look sad? Uh, I'm not. But I see your face is a little wet, because you have tears. I'm just happy you're here with me. Oh. Oh. Mm. This amazing! Woo! Woo! - Hey, put me down! - I got ya. - Okay, okay. Mommy to the rescue. Mommy here. Mom, are you playing? Waa! You're so brave. You got this. No, I'm not brave without you. - Yes, you are. - No. I'm not brave without you. I couldn't have do it, done it without you. I love you. I love you. Hey. It's time for you to find your path. I know. Once upon a time, words began to vanish from the language of children. They disappeared so quietly that at first almost no one noticed. Fading away like water on stone, the words were those that children used to name the natural world around them. Acorn, adder, bluebell, bramble, conker, gone. Fern, heather, kingfisher, otter, raven, willow, wren, all of them gone. The words were becoming lost, no longer vivid in children's voices, no longer alive in their stories. You have really good stories, Bodhi. - Daddy's sleeping. - You're my buggy. You hold in your hands a spell book for conjuring back these lost words. You will need to seek, find, and speak. It deals in things that are missing and things that are hidden, in absences and in appearances. It is told in gold, the gold of the goldfinches that flit through its pages on charms. And it holds not poems, but spells of many kinds that might just by the old strong magic of being spoken aloud unfold dreams and songs and summon lost words back into the mouth and the mind's eye. What is the lost word? We have to find it. - You ready? - Yeah. And then he realized that everything that he had been looking for was already inside of himself, because Bodhi was free, and he always was free. And he never died.
