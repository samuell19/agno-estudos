Cat sized. - How did they know it was a wolf did it? - Some lady saw it. - (whispers) Guys. Look. Oh hi there, little fella. How you doing? Got something for you. - Hey! (dog growls) Come here, Donald. - It was only a two pointer anyway, Krystal. - [Cory] Yeah, but two points ties her with you, Beau. - So what are you doing Klein, taking your bunny for a walk? - [Krystal] What a dork. - [Cory] Look, he's gonna do it. - That is unbelievable. It's like clockwork. You're such a pussy. (dog barks) (jazzy swing music) What the hell's that? - Come on, Roscoe.

What do you say, Finn? Let's start setting up! (French accordion music) - Tonight's gonna be a great show. - [Crew Member] Easy! (laughter) - There is no hot water, Harley. - Oh no, Mr. Crabby Buster, there's plenty of sunlight to warm the tank. - There's a tear at the side wall of the baby show, Harl. - Well stitch it up, double time, Finn. Have a good one tonight, baby. Don't forget, you're the main attraction. - You say that to all of us, Harley. - Yes, but when I say it to you I mean it. And the other side. Thank you very much. - [Whiffer] That is disgusting. - [Cory] There's no way that's a chick. - [Whiffer] That's a chick. - [Cory] No way! - That's a chick, you can tell. - What are you, a breeder now? - You're the one caught sweet talking your uncle's bouvier, dude. - That was a misunderstanding. - [Whiffer] Fix your erection, Cory. - Shut up. - That's big game, boys. (snorts) - 10 points? - 15. - Athena? Can I get you anything? - [Athena] Hi, honey. - Hi. - Could you empty my bucket? - All you have to do is ask. - Could you help me up? I just hate to bother anybody. - Are you crazy, everybody loves you. - I love you too. Now what's wrong? Come on, what's wrong? - I was thinking. Christoph Christine's like me, born into the sideshow. Never been anything but a freak. Same with Buster. But you, you weren't always fat. How did it feel to just be normal? - Oh honey. Normal wasn't so great. (gentle piano music) (gunshot) - Point. (alternative rock radio music) (gunshot) - Stop it. (laughing) (gunshot) - Point. (gunshot) (gunshot) Point. You were cocky about your car, Beau. But thanks for keeping her so cherry for me. - Krystal, thanks for keeping your cherry for me too. (laughter) Speaking of stupid bets. - I'm a better shot, Beau. (alarms blaring) What do you think they do over there? - For the third year, the fastest growing sector in the cosmetics industry remains elective facial surgery. Buying trends indicate that consumers are no longer satisfied with covering up their flaws, they want to eliminate them. We're developing a designer iris pallet. Within eight years the bell charm eye line should be available for reproductive use. Brown eyes can now be detected and corrected in the womb. That is our growth market. (animal noises) (door alarm rings) (dramatic sax music) - Hey Miles. How you doing? - Ryan? What are you doing down here? - Nothing, I'm just visiting with Miles. - [Klein] They're not pets. You know better. - [Brian] Sorry. - I want you to stay away from the woods until I say so. I don't trust that posse. - What posse? - Well you've heard the wolf howling by the lake the last few nights haven't you? - [Ryan] Yes. - Well it appears the wolf killed Mrs. Shapiro's Siamese. It was declawed, but she let it out anyway. Now the farmers formed a posse to shoot the wolf. Promise me you'll stay out of the woods, sweetheart. (upbeat carnie music) (laughter) - Step right up, step this way! Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the freak show! A glimpse of the old world brought magically to you from a forgotten past where nature ruled over man with a wry smile. We bring you the world's tiniest musical assemblage.

You're not allowed back here with the wagons, go on. Go on! - [Beau] (chuckles) Let's go, guys. She could use the beauty sleep. - Stop right there! You wanna take care of that first? - Here. Wouldn't want anybody stepping in this, would we? (laughter) - Five minutes, baby. - [Tara] What did they want, Harley? - They're just curious. - They hate me. - They don't hate you. You're my best girl. Ladies and gentlemen, come closer. Closer. That's close enough, son. Do you know what's in the cage, son? Inside that cage is a creature so rare, so unusual, that I will give everyone back double their admission price, triple, ladies and gentlemen, if they have ever seen anything like her. She was born in a mountain wilderness. Discovered by hunters when she was just a child. Was she human? Was she animal? Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the terrifying Wolf Girl! (snarling) (gasps) (growling) (howling) - He's gonna throw it. Whiff, he's gonna throw it. (gasps) (snickering) (pained howling) (applause) - Let me out of this cage! (sobbing) - [Beau] Hey, pass me the bottle. (somber piano music) - How could anybody do that to her? - They're just kids, Harley. - But it gets worse and worse. Used to be people liked to come see the freaks. Now I can barely hold a show together. If I could just find a circus. - Circus doesn't want us, Harl. Not for a long time. You couldn't even get a carnival to take us now. Time's changed. - Goodnight, Athena. - Night, honey. - If I find out who threw that... - Doesn't matter. - Of course it matters. - That was so funny, did you see that wolf thing's face, it was like. (howls) - Weird seeing it up close though. - She looks evil. Why doesn't she do something about herself? - She's like this hairy chick though, you know? I don't know, you could see her eyes, it was weird. - She's a freak, Whiff. - She's a 15 pointer, and she's mine. - I should get points for tonight. - Please, she was in a cage Beau, it doesn't count. - But funny as shit. (wolves howling) - I can't see-- - Shhh. (Roscoe growls) - God, would you relax, Whiff? (Roscoe snarls) - Come here! (howling) - What'd you do that for?

Leave me alone! (howling) - You're the pussy. - Piece of shit. The hell are you doing here? - You can throw shit, but you can't take it, Beau. - Get up! Get up, now! If you tell anybody about this, I will shove my fist so far down your throat you will shit fingers. - Tell anybody about what? - About me being afraid. - No, I mean I already... - [Beau] Nobody can understand you anyways. - Morning, fuzzy face. I'm making omelets. You hungry? - I don't eat eggs, Harley. No eggs, no fish, no chicken. Nothing with a face. - Show me an egg with a face. (door slams) (dramatic orchestral music) (doorbell rings) - Hi. Come in. Yes, I wrote that. Ryan Klein. I'm also known as Crying Ryan, but that was in grade school. Therapy's helping me heal. - This is a joke isn't it? - No it's not, definitely. - Your note said that you could help me. Help me how? This is kinda creepy. - This is my mother's lab. - She like a mad scientist? - She does cosmetics research. She tests lipstick and mascara and-- - What's she gonna give me, a makeover? - Her real passion is depilatories. She thinks people are obsessed with shaving and waxing and lasering. If she can isolate the genes that cause back hair, she'll be a billionaire. I've been studying your disease, hypertrichosis, and I think I have something that can help you. They were testing this stuff topically, but my mother realized that it works better intravenously. The formulations are unproven, but... Hey Miles, look at the pretty girl. Just yesterday Miles was covered with hair, so as you can see, they work. - [Tara] That's amazing. - If we're gonna do this, we should do it now. My mom might be home any minute, I can't risk her finding out. - Just like that? Let you inject me with some unproven experimental serum? - You could wait. Takes seven years to get a drug approved. Unless you're happy with the way you are. You'll just feel a little pinch. (ominous atmosphere music) You'll probably notice an increase in your appetite. You'll have a headache and... Any other side effects I need to know about. (upbeat carnie music) - Ladies and gentlemen! Roll up! Roll up! Come on now! Come on, gather around! Come a little closer. Dare to come a little closer. Ladies and germs, The Geek! Is the most horrible of sideshow attractions. Even the lowliest freaks look down on her. Some human oddities, The Crab Man, The Wolf Girl, wear their animal ancestry on the outside. For The Geek, it is an insatiable blood thirst. She cannot suppress. Friends, the squeamish should cover their eyes. (loud crunch) (audience groans) (wolves howling) - [Barber] Can I help you? (barking and snarling) - Hey. (growling) (gasps and screams) (dramatic ethereal music) (upbeat swing music) (laughter) ♫ Anywhere you go, I'll go ♫ Whatever you do, I'll do - I don't know about this, you guys. - Whiffer, you are such a feet in the air squealing bottom. - What did she ever do to you? - If you don't wanna come, don't come. ♫ When we don't see eye to eye ♫ When we try to say goodbye - She's not in her wagon. - Oh shit. (laughter and applause) What is it, honey? What's wrong? - Headache. - [Harley] Headache? Did you take something? - No. - Come on baby, get it together. ♫ Every thought you think, I thought ♫ There's just a heartbeat delay (uproarious laughter and applause) ♫ Anywhere you go, I'll go ♫ I'll follow you - Ladies and gentlemen. I give you the terrifying Wolf Girl! (growling and snarling) (gasps and shrieks) (pained howling) (growling) - Get her off of me! Get her off! - That's not Tara. - No it isn't. (audience screaming) - Nunzio! Christina.

People nowadays are afraid of anything that's different. - Hi. - You! - Athena, no no no, it wasn't him! Let him go. - Are you sure? - Yes, it's all right. He's my friend. - You harm her and I'll flatten you like a pancake. - I would never harm her. I'm Ryan. - I'm Athena. (jubilant music) (laughter) - I'm really sorry about that. It's just, she's just very protective, you know. - Yeah. - She's the closest thing to a mother I have. - I am familiar with (mumbles). - What does she see in him? (laughter) - Why any woman would want a man taller than a pussy is beyond me. (laughter) Let me see that. Oh you know, it's very long. - It's a record! It's a box office record. (cheering) Where's Tara, did you see her? She had those people terrified. I haven't seen a gaff like that since Coney Island. - I'm sure Lon Chaney's eating his heart out. - What did you do to the cage Finn, did you change the bars? - I figured it was you. - Was it one of you boys? - No. - Well I'll be damned. - This is where I come when I'm feeling, well, you know. - I'd come every day. - I do. - Do you know those guys? - Who, the neanderthals? - I resemble that remark. - Yeah. I wish I was a seven foot lunkhead with bulging biceps. - You'd take blue veins over gray matter? - Yeah. We can't do another treatment. - What? Why? - Well you nearly killed Beau. I think that certainly rates as a side effect. - No, that was part of the show. I mean that's what people wanna see. A girl act like an animal. - So you haven't had any other side effects? - No. - That's good. Tara, that's really good. We can do another treatment tomorrow. - Okay. Ryan. - Yeah? (laughing) (sheep baaing) (growling) (panicked baaing) (gasps) - Morning, sweetie. - I thought you used the men's room. - Bust a complaint to Harley. If he stands on this side of me he gets pee shy. (chuckles) - Christine, did you ever have a serious boyfriend, girlfriend, whatever, I mean a lover? - Mostly not so serious. My lovers need a sense of humor. - Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever have one. - You see a hairy monster? Doesn't matter so much what you see. There is a boy in the world that will look at you and see what I see. I see a beautiful girl on the inside. - Get out. - [Christine] Oh damn it. - Wow! - I know. - Wow. - I know. - So any side effects? - Nope, nothing. - Okay, well what about mood swings? - Nope. - [Ryan] What about irritability or tension? - No. - Headaches, dizziness, hallucinations? - No, no, no. - Increased appetite. - No! I feel amazing, Ryan. I never felt like this before. I've dreamt about this all my life and it's really happening. - Let's do it then. - I think we should increase the dosage, Ryan. I mean, I don't know when the sideshow's gonna pull out of town. Increase the dose. - I can't increase the dosage without testing it. I'm using Donald here to test side effects on his eyes. It's okay, Donald. If Donald can handle a dose and a half, then you can too. - Ryan? Ryan, what are you doing? I told you to stop playing with the animals. If you feed it something, or you get it too excited, it can ruin months of my work. Now put it away, come on. - Okay. Go on, Donald. Think I can hang out with Donald for a minute? - No you are not. I don't want you down here. Come on, you had lunch? - No I haven't, but I'm actually just meeting a friend in about 20 minutes at the diner. - That's wonderful. Who with? - Actually a girl. - A girl? Where did you meet this girl? - At the sideshow outside of town. - The freak show? - She's one of the oddities. She's The Wolf Girl. - You're dating an oddity? I know sometimes you... You feel like you don't fit in. But you're a normal boy. Really. Someday you're gonna have a girlfriend. She's gonna be so pretty. I don't want you going back to that show again, Ryan. Ugly people should not be put on display for other people to stare at. They should be allowed to stay at home. (car honking) ("Just Say Something" by Justin Burgess) ♫ Just say something, yeah yeah, yeah yeah ♫ Just say something, yeah yeah, yeah yeah - Sorry about everyone staring at me. I believe my friend would like to order something. - Never mind. - She needs a place mat and a menu. - It's okay, Ryan. - How about a couple of cheeseburgers? - Want them well done? - Rare please. - I wanna know something about you. Tell me something about yourself. - Something beyond the obvious? I'm pretty much defined as The Wolf Girl. - You have parents? - Harley used to tell me this bedtime story about my beautiful mother and my handsome father and they were from Romania and how much they loved me. They were too young and poor to take care of me. - You don't believe that? - Well as I got older, I started to ask more questions about my parents, my real parents, not my family I have in the sideshow. One day, it was just this past summer, Harley decided that I was old enough to know the truth. When I was born my father was so ashamed, he left my mother saying that she was cursed to have a child like me. My mother tried to manage alone, but soon the whole village knew about me. Some townspeople thought that I was the Devil or something and harassed my mother. She protected me the best she could because Harley said that if they found me, they would've killed me. (baby cooing) My mother ran off with me wandering for days. (applause) - Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to The Freak Show! - [Tara] She was hungry and lost when she came upon Harley's sideshow. - Where everyone is unique, and no two things the same! Ladies and gentlemen... - [Tara] The show was destitute then, in its darkest days after being kicked out of the circus. - Give them a rousing Bucharesti welcome! Thank you! (dramatic ethereal music) (applause) - [Tara] I don't blame my mother. What choice did she have? - Well what have we here? Hello there, little baby. Look at you. Aren't you a fuzzy little thing. It's all right. I've got you now. You're gonna fit right in here. - [Tara] When Harley saw me, there was light in his eyes. - You've come to the right place. - [Tara] My mother returned to the village without me having told people earlier that I was dead. But the townspeople knew the truth and they killed my mother. They shot her because of me. (gunshot) Because I'm ugly. - [Ryan] I'm sorry, Tara. - [Tara] I don't want you to feel sorry for me. - Didn't you see the sign, Klein? No pets allowed. - You're very funny, Beau. - Don't talk back to me, shithead. Or I will get you. And your little dog too. Ow! (gasps) (growling) Hey, I'll catch you later, Toto. - Excuse me. - Hear that wolf killed another sheep at old man Crebin's farm last night. - [Whiffer] Maybe we should stay out of the woods. - Guys, let's go. - I'm sorry, Beau. - That's just great, thanks, thank Whiff, that's awesome. - I'm really really really really really really really really sorry. - Shut up. Whiff, shut up. - Really really really-- - Shut up! It's fine. It's cool. No problem. You guys just go ahead, I'll meet you there. - I'm sorry. - Don't worry about it. - Thanks for lunch, Ryan. Harley would be pissed at me for putting on a free show. (dramatic flute music) (snarling and growling) - Saw your show. It was really cool. Especially when you bit that rabbit. Is your fur real? Can I touch it? Soft. - You born with it? Awesome. - Our friend over here puked when he saw you. Nothing personal, but you look really freaky. - Cool show. We're coming back tonight. (upbeat circus music) (bells ringing) (carnie sax music) - Don't touch, kid. Show some respect. You call this the dime museum. The freaks call it the baby show. Most freaks are killed as soon as they're born. These are the freaks who didn't survive. The ones who do come to me. I teach them to be strong and wily. Remember that. Little boy. - That good? Thanks, honey. Mmmm, sweet. (vomiting) (gentle piano music) (applause) (cheers and applause) (dog growling and barking) (louder growl) (dog whimpers) (soft rock radio music) - Get the hell outta here! Get the hell outta here! - Ladies and gentlemen, who would you choose? The beautiful Christine? (cheering and whistling) Or the dapper Christoph? We each of us have a bit of the other, it's easy to choose, but half and half? Is this nature's blessing or God's cruel joke? ♫ There are two sides to every story ♫ Every story has two sides ♫ When boy meets girl in all their glory ♫ Sometimes both worlds collide ♫ Since the first big bang there's been the yin and the yang ♫ And still to tango it takes two ♫ In any good fling, when the fat lady sings ♫ You need a dong to make a ding, it's true ♫ There are two sides to every story ♫ In every battle ever fought ♫ When boy meets girl in all their glory ♫ Someone always gets caught (glass shatters) ♫ There are two sides to every story ♫ Every story has two sides ♫ When boy meets girl in all their glory ♫ Sometimes both world collide. - Yeah!

(upbeat carnie music) (applause) (gunshot) (applause) - Kid, got a nickel? I'll give you a peek. - I've never seen boobs that big. (knocking) - What? - No one can know. - Fine. I won't say anything. - No one can know. (roars) (gunshot) - She's gone. - Shit. - Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry to tell you there will be no more performances tonight. (groans and boos) Please come back tomorrow. (growling) (ominous atmosphere music) (animalistic breathing) (growling) (roaring) - Somebody help me! - Where the hell could Beau have got to? He wouldn't just leave his car. - Maybe he's boffing the snake lady. - You're projecting again. (roaring) - We have a code here, Harl. - You hurt one of us, you hurt us all. - We have to look out for each other, Harley. No one else will. - I look out for you. Your whole lives, ever since you were left at my door. You used to beg for change on the street. I kept you safe and I fed you. Even when no one else could bear to look at you. I took care of you all like you were my own children, and I still do. - I know, Harley. We all know. - These people will be back tomorrow, you know. And they'll bring more. Did you see them? They were scared. (dramatic atmosphere music) (knocking) - Tara. (moaning) - [Performer] Ahem! - Sorry, I didn't... I'm sorry. (gasps) - [Cory] Beau! Yo Beau! - Guys, we shouldn't even be here, this is fucked. - Whiffer would you relax, you homo. - Whoa. (dramatic orchestral music) (shrieks) (ominous atmosphere music) - It happens sometimes, sweetheart. Animals will do that when they feel endangered. The fox caught in a trap, they'll chew themselves to get free. Always trying to escape. Naturally I'm very sad. I'll have to start all over again. - Morning. - Morning. - We were all out looking for you last night. - Yeah, I know. - Felt like being alone? - Mmmhm. - Harley's thinking about pulling out of town early. - Why? - Haven't been yourself. - Hormones. - "Hormones." (knocking) - The dose that I gave Donald. He chewed himself to death. - I'm sorry. You were trying to help. You did. Look at me. I need another shot, Ryan. Please. A couple more treatments. I could be normal, Ryan. - I can't. Donald went psychotic. Tara. Tara. Tara, what are you doing? Tara, you're gonna get sick! - You started this! (glass shatters) - You are going to sit down and tell me exactly where you have been. - Nowhere. (upbeat swing radio music) - Nowhere? I'm worried about you. - Just leave me alone! Why can't everyone just leave me alone? (door slams) - Damn. Caught him with his pants down. - [Krystal] You guys think it was the wolf? - [Cory] Dude, look at his wang. - [Whiffer] It get bit off? - [Cory] No, that's it, that's the whole thing. - Ew. Sick. Freak. - It's even smaller than mine. - [Krystal] Come on. You guys, come on! - Friends, if you have a fear of needles... Do not watch what is about to happen. (growls) He feels pain. Just like everyone else. But The Human Pin Cushion craves the piercing pain in his body. Because it drowns the pain in his heart. (cheers and applause) (upbeat carnie music) - So what do you think? I don't think she should do the show tonight, Harl. - She will do the show. Get some roustabouts on crowd control, will you? Ladies and gentlemen, the show is about to begin! Step inside, step inside! (classical music) (cheers and applause) (rhythmic clapping) - You think he got what he deserved? - What the hell kind of question's that? - I'm just thinking. - What the hell kind of world would this be if we all got what we deserved? (cheers and clapping) (applause) - There's plenty of room for everyone, ladies and gentlemen, don't push, don't shove. Leave some breathing room for the people up front here. Welcome to the freak show! A world of wonders, where everything is unique and no two things alike. We do not wish to alarm you, but don't make eye contact. No sudden moves. Last night, as some of you already know, The Wolf Woman escaped from her cage. Hold on there, son. Wolves are carnivores you know. Do you know what a carnivore is? It's a meat eater, son. If she were to get one whiff of that wiener in your hand, she might break out and come and get it. There's no telling where she might stop if she's really hungry. Smart kid. (growling) Tonight, you are about to witness one of nature's cruelest mistakes! A savage combination of woman and animal. But please, take pity. To us this creature is merely an oddity. So vile that we cannot help but stare and gape. But imagine what it must be like to be so deformed. Imagine if it were you who was so revolting and disgusting to others, imagine your horror as you looked into the mirror. Imagine, please, yourselves. If you were like her. If you were a freak. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you The Wolf-- (gasps) (growling) (gagging) Help me! - It was her. It was her, she killed him, she killed Beau! (screaming) - Don't panic, please! Don't panic!
