- Computer stop. - There she is. - Honey, love, my soul linked to the outside world. The only one permitted to jump the firewall. The one who forgot the chocolate. - Oh shit, did I? - Yeah, it's okay though, Jerry, everything's great. I am low on wine though, hint, hint. - Again? - Yeah, well, you know, tough day. - Yeah. - Yeah, my last neighbor moved out. Not that we ever talked. - Yeah, I was gonna say good riddance. - Yeah but I think I'm gonna miss the sounds through the wall if that makes any sense. - Four months, four short months and you're free jailbird. Okay, free to fly to me and your landlord, he'll be free to tear the place to the ground. Ashes to fucking ashes. - What if he turns off the utilities? What if he turns off the water? - Then I'll get them turned back on. I make big noise, babe, for you, I'll make the biggest noise. Ah! - My knight and shining chat window. - At your service. - Honey, if I had a view out to the world right now, would it depress me? - Nah, people aren't that mad anymore. I mean, if that's what you mean. I mean, you're occasionally referenced in an SNL sketch about stock market scams, but how many SNL sketches do they do about stock market scams? - Well, there is that one. I've got a fever and the only prescription is more stock market scams. - Listen babe, I gotta hit the hay, early morning at the office. - Oh, okay, well, I'm glad I got you for a bit. - You got me for a lot. - I love you. - Love you. - Hey! Computer, stop. Computer, what time is it? - It's 7:30 PM. - Computer, what time is it? - The time is 11:17 PM. Computer, stop. Oh my god, Jerry. - Hey babe. - What happened, you've ever done that before? - Yeah, sorry, I had a work emergency. - Oh, a work emergency? - Yeah. - What's her name? - Come on, Charon, don't, don't do that. Don't ever do that, not after everything I've- - I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Jerry, you gotta know that I'm kidding. Okay, so what, tell me about this office emergency. What do they have you doing these days? - I'd really rather not talk about it, if that's okay. It wasn't a gold star night. Not by a long shot but you know what would make things better? Honestly, you told me about your day. - Oh, well, you know, same old, same old. I worked out and I did my conditioning and I looked at all my dorky stuff and I petted the babies and oh, I did have an interesting night last, about two nights ago. - Yeah. - I guess someone stormed the castle, you could say, middle of the night, loud banging on my door. And by the time I got to it, they were gone. But they'd slipped something under, a threat, I think. - Shit, a threat? What did it say? - Well, it was a piece of paper and it said, "Do you know you're dead?" Weird. Right? - Definitely. - Like why gets Socratic with it? You know, why not just say, "I'm gonna kill you, bitch." - Yeah, I don't know, babe and this person just left. - I guess, it actually sounded like multiple people. - Drunk maybe. - Law enforcement is doing a very bad job of not letting people know I'm here. - Yeah, well, people get that kind of information on the internet if they look hard enough and people do have a reason to look. You did lose a lot of folk their life savings. - I'm aware, Jerry, share thief Charon is aware. - Okay, bad, all bad, start over, let's start over. - I really did go a little crazy last night, Jerry. I was so worried and I couldn't breathe. And I actually considered making a break for it to check on you - Babe, Charon, you know you absolutely cannot do that. That especially, setting foot outside the apartment would add, fuck, what did they say? Two years to your sentence. - I'm aware, Jerry. Okay, most restrictive house arrest sentence in state history, digital communication limited to one, no visitors. Narrow range of physical confinement to prevent me from getting anywhere near a wifi signal. A fucking wifi signal. - Well, you especially did a lot of damage with access to the internet. - I'm aware, goddammit, Jerry. - Okay, okay, babe, calm down. Hey, hey. I'm here. Four months, then you've paid your dues. We're gonna make it one day at a time. - Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's fucking silly. We've come too far for me to fall to pieces. - Just a bad night, you're all in one piece. One pretty piece. - Jerry, please don't leave me again. You're all I have. - You have the rabbits. - I do have the rabbits. And they're good for a lot of things. They're not good for everything. Can I see it? - See it? - You know. - Babe, not tonight, it's been weird. You said it yourself, weird. - Oh, I mean- - Let's just start again tomorrow. You know, we have tomorrow, we have all the tomorrows. Don't worry. Good night. - Jerry, you're really all I have. - I never forget it. - Computer, what's the weather like at Saint-Tropez? Computer, what was the metallic composition of Tico Bride's prosthetic nose? Computer, who wrote Jumanji? Computer, what is... My name is spelled the way it is because my mom didn't know the proper spelling. It really didn't bother me until the third grade when Greek myths came up in the curriculum. - I don't follow - C H A R O N. It's Charon, it's the figure that ferries the dead across the river sticks. It's the first mythological figure that Dante encounters in hell, it's the name of one of the moons, Pluto. So at times it's the satellite that's the furthest away from the warmth of the sun in our entire solar system. - Okay. - Do you know that in Taiwan there is a tunnel that goes through a mountain and they say that if you crash and die in that tunnel, then your soul just keeps on driving for all eternity. And it doesn't ever realize that it's dead? - Charon, why are you like this tonight? - I'm just thinking about death. - Is it because I forgot the chocolate? - And the wine. - Sorry, babe. - Oh, I'm low on foundation for my face. So do you remember the brand, right? - Yeah and I've been meaning to talk to you about that. All that face stuff is just real expensive. Like all primer and foundation and powder and whatnot. - It's important to me, honey - Why, I'm the only one looking at you. - Yeah. - Hey, hey, stop babe. You're beautiful. You're beautiful is what I'm saying. You don't need all that stuff. Come on, Charon. Look at me. There's my girl. How about the next time I call you, you show me what's under all that gunky makeup shit. - Oh, I don't know, Jerry. - Okay, well, you think about that. But how about right now, you show me what's under that robe? - Oh, honey, I'm not feeling very beautiful tonight. It would just be sad, I guess. And I don't wanna fake my way through it. - You know, you're awful like this, Charon. Seriously, lately, you're just, is this how it's gonna be with you now? - Jerry- - No, save it, I'm done. Computer, stop. Computer, cancel all alarms. - Canceling all your alarms. - I could, I could go to him. Apologize, maybe he will... What do you think, Careless whisper, worth the sentence extension? Eight days. There has to be someone else, which means he'll never call again. And we are cut off and we have nothing left. We might as well, we might as well be... No, no. Jerry, Jerry, I thought. - Hi, babe. It's good to see you. - It's good to see you too. - I'm sorry, I'm so sorry - Jerry. It's okay. - I haven't been honest with you. - Oh. - I'm ashamed of this. But it's not fair to you to go on not knowing, babe, Charon, I lost my job three months ago and I haven't been able to pay for well, fuck, anything. I'm behind on rent. I'm behind on bills. It's getting to the point where food's an issue and your utilities. - Well, honey, honey, please, please don't. You could have told me I could have gone without so much of what you sent me. Is this why you haven't been calling? Because you've been ashamed? - It was just easier to make you think I was angry than admit that I couldn't keep providing for you, so fucking unfair. I'm such an asshole. - Jerry, Jerry, I forgive you, I'll always forgive you. Please don't ever feel like you have to leave. I love you. - Never stop loving you, babe. You look beautiful, by the way. - There's something else. There's something else that's wrong. - Okay, yeah, yes, fuck, oh fuck, yo know me. - What is it, you can tell me? - Don't panic, but I got a bank alert this morning. Someone's put $5,000 in escrow in my name and I don't know who it is. - Why would I panic? That's kind of amazing. - Wait, it's not that simple. There's a note in the account, a request. I get the funds released to me in exchange for something, something awful. - Huh? - Whoever it is wants a video of you putting a finger down a running garbage disposal. I don't think you have to do the whole finger. Maybe just the tip. - You can't be serious. - Look, my gut tells me this is real. It's too bizarre not to be something. And I wouldn't even have mentioned it. But babe, I'm out of options. I get evicted at the end of the week. I can't even buy us anything. I'm overdrafted and maxed out and I- - Who is this motherfucker? - I don't know, it's all anonymous - Encrypted, Jerry, I can walk you through exactly how to hack directly. - Babe. - There is a breadcrumb. Okay, there's always a digital breadcrumb, a fingerprint, a footprint that I can- - Charon, stop. Stop, this is why you're locked away. So you need to stop talking. Right the fuck now. - You have to go to law enforcement with this. It's sick, even if you can't get me anything, I mean, they won't let me just starve in here, right and when it comes to your rent, I mean, maybe your landlord can arrange some kind- - Babe, I can't protect you from this anymore. - Protect me from what? - You're not liked out here, okay, you're not forgiven for what you did by anyone, for fuck sake. There were suicides off of bridges. - I know, I know Jerry. - And law enforcement ignores me when it comes to you. Do you even know what I have to pay the private courier to get 'em to deliver to you? Everyone would rather you disappear, that you rot away. And I babe, my own family doesn't talk to me anymore. I have no friends left because I choose you. How do you think I lost my job? Someone told them. Fucking hell! It's just us now. We're all we've got. - Do you really think that just the tip counts? - Yeah. - And you're sure that this person will release the funds? - No. - Why couldn't they just ask to see boobs like a regular pervert? Can you see everything? - Yeah. - Okay. - I'm sorry, Charon. - You're okay, babe, you're the greatest woman I know. I'm here with you, I'm here. - Usher definitely does not say peace soup in, "Yeah". - He doesn't say pea soup, ate downtown. - No. No. Why would it be that you big dork. It's peace up, A town down. - Yeah, I guess that makes more sense than Usher enjoying a pea soup lunch downtown. Good babe? - Mm. So good. - Hey, I've got good news, kind of. I've got a job interview tomorrow - Honey, something you wanna do? - Hell no, but work's work, I'll tell you about it if it goes, I don't wanna jinx it. - Well, good luck, my handsome man, I'm so proud of you. - Thanks babe, not down for the count yet. Charon, I know we said I wouldn't ask you about this, but... - Shoot, it's all right. - Why, why go that far, why risk so much? - Well, I guess it was flattering having my talents recognized by someone so rich and powerful. It was more than flattering actually. He was like, I always say a titan. And by the time the advances started, I was just his, I mean, I knew what I was doing. Of course, you know, the program was accessing tens of thousands of accounts hourly. I mean, the scale of it was just terrifying to think about. So I didn't, I was just moving the money where he said and after a while it was just all numbers on a screen. We tech people, we get that way. - So he played on your nature. - Well, he made me feel loved and I loved him - More than you loved me? - No and I got locked away for that prick. So I should tell you how much I love you. - Oh, well, cheers to us. - Cheers to us. Computer stop. You stop it right now. Good evening my Knight. - Hey. - Oh, honey, what is it? Is it the job interview? - You know, I wouldn't know. My car got impounded this morning. Missed the interview entirely. - Oh, will they let you reschedule? Not that, I mean, honey, it's gonna be okay either way. - No, it's not okay, it's really, really not okay. It's gonna be two grand to pay for all my tickets to get the car out and with the back rent I just paid my landlord. And your, it's all gone - In two days? - Don't even start with me. - God, fuck, there's something else. - Something else? - Another 10 grand just showed up in that account. - What does he want now? - I don't know. There's no note this time but something tells me it's coming. - No, Jerry, no, okay, if we, who knows how far this is gonna go? - Look, let's wait to see what he's asking for. - Jerry. - I can't think right now, babe. I don't have my car. It's going up $300 every day that they're holding it. - I know, but- - I can't babe, I, let's just talk tomorrow. Maybe he'll have told us what to do tomorrow. And can we can see if it's too crazy. - You have to go to the police now, it's time. - I can't look at you right now. - Jerry, Jerry, listen to me. Do not hang up, you and I, we can think of something. We can think of some way to get, no, damn it. Fuck. - All right, everyone, poll's up. You know the drill, wire one grand into the account to cast your vote. Now, if you're new here, welcome. You can vote as many times as you want. 10 grand gets you 10 votes. And look, we are getting your requests. We know what you wanna see. But I know Charon, she has her limits and we're gonna work our way up to that, trust me. But for tonight, what we're voting on is do we see if we can make her drink out of the toilet or do we see if we can get her to smash her finger with a hammer? Okay, so evidently one of you out there did something extremely stupid a couple of nights ago. Some moronic stunt to get Charon to, I don't know follow the white rabbit, go tumbling down a rabbit hole. Doesn't matter who that person was because that person is gone, poof. We saw to that. And if you think I'm joking, I can't stress enough that the people who set this up for us, they're not fucking around, think about how much effort has gone into setting this game up. Faking her death with the media, paying off law enforcement to look the other way. Vacating all our neighbors. These people are rich, okay? Powerful, titans. And I wanna remind anyone else out there that wants to be a vigilante, that we've ticked that box. We are the vigilantes, this is share thief Charon. She deserves even worse than this. And I get it more than anyone. I had empathy for her once. I loved her, but I came around when I, well, yeah, yeah. I'm getting paid for this, yes, I don't deny that. I don't fucking deny that. - Computer, cancel all alarms - Canceling all your alarms. - Hi honey, you had me worried. - I know, I'm sorry. Seems like I'm saying that a lot these days. - It's all right, you're under a lot of pressure. By the way, is your address still 1144 Shepherd Drive 90211? - Yeah. Why? - Just thinking lately about seeing you. I wanna be ready. - Well, it'll be a few months. - I know. - Listen, babe, I know it's probably the last thing you wanna hear right now, but we gotta consider this. An additional dollar came into that escrow account this morning and a note was attached to it. - Oh? - Yeah and he, God, I almost can't even say it. He wants a video of you drinking out of your toilet. I'm sorry, but it's $10,000. - It's a lot of money. - Yeah, so I guess we gotta think about it. - I have thought about it, Jerry - You have? And- - And I don't think you love me anymore. - Charon, of course I love you. And God, it's killing me to even ask you for this. And maybe that's what he wants but I don't know what else to do. I wanna keep providing for us. Babe, Charon, why did you move your computer? - You don't love me, Jerry. You don't love me anymore, so I have to go. - Go, where are you going, babe, Charon, don't do this. Don't do this, we're almost there. We're almost together, fuck, listen. Okay, we don't have to do anything this guy says, it's just, God fucking dammit. Dumb bitch. Fuck, cut it, send someone, wait. If any of you mother fuckers actually try to come to my house, you're dead, okay, cut it.
