I beg for your mercy! Please don't kill me! - Ma'am! Ma'am! - Be quiet! Why did you come here? You should leave this place, or they will kill you. Go help save the others. Untie the others. Be careful. - Go! - Quickly! You should come with me now. We'll run away from here. They are outside. They are outside. Please listen to me. We should get out of here. Please, listen just this once. Save yourself. Wait! Detain everybody in this house. Kill every Dutchman. Take her! Matsuya... Matsuya! I beg you, let us go. You promised to help us all. We? Who do you think you are? I helped you. I have given all the information you asked. I have betrayed my own country. I beg you... Don't let us die in our own country. Poor Netherland. You are not a native in this country. Tonight you will die in my country. Quickly! Come on! The time is 14.03. I'm bored. So? Let's play guessing games. - What guessing games? - Finger. - Like yesterday? - Yes. Alright. - Don't touch my hand. - I can't see. - Don't put your hand too far, Dika. - No, Ambar. You're cheating, touching is not allowed. It's five. Wrong. You're cheating. One more time. How many are these? No, don't. - It's two, right? - You're right. - But you're wrong. - You're a cheat. I don't want to play with you. I'm not cheating, the answer is eleven. How can it be eleven? One and one. Eleven. Ambar. Ambar. There is nobody behind us, right? Don't look. In the city, there are no rice fields like these. Are we already at the incline? Turn left. - Here? - Yes. Is it still far, Dika? Retirement Home It's this way alright. But it's still far. - Are you tired? - No, not yet. Careful, there's a car. This way. Careful, there's a car. Come on. This way. - Thank you. - Take care. Ambar! Dika! Mom! This way! This way. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. - How are you? - I'm fine. Ms. Wati, where are the other residents of this retirement home? During Eid holidays, many residents are away. So only a few stay here. Come in. Wow, it's so big! Agus, please take them to their room. I will leave you for a moment. Come on. Dika, let's go. This is your room. This is nice! - Come in. - The room is big. Where should I sleep? Dika, don't mess up this room, okay? Okay. Let's go. He looks so happy. I hope you and Dika feel at home here. One moment. There's a piano! I only know that song. Don't be noisy, Dika. What is this picture? - Who is coming? - The grandchildren of Wati's friend. Her name is Ambar, right? Dika. This retirement home was opened in the 1970's. Their parents have passed away. So they are going to stay here. Ambar, Dika, I will introduce you to the others. This is Grandpa Farid. This is Grandma Ida. Come on in, Ambar. Shake hands with all of them, Dika. This is Grandma Ani. - Hello, grandpa. - Dika, sit next to grandma. Sit here, dear. - What? - Hello, grandma. Ambar, this is Grandma Ani. Hello, Grandma Ani. Sit here. Here. Are you blind? Ani, don't say that. She can still see. It's okay. I can still see, but not as clearly as others. Very blurry. Same like grandpa. I used to have blurry vision too. It's because you drank too much, grandpa. Why, you! Ambar, this is Rina. She's the one who takes care of all of us here. Hi, Rina. Rina, please come here. Have you two rested? No, we haven't. I want to say goodbye too. I'm sorry that I can't celebrate Eid with you all this year. Is it alright, grandma? - Agus. - Yes, ma'am. - I will leave them all for you to care. - Okay. - Take care, ma'am. - Yes, okay. - Good bye. - Good bye. - Why does Wati leave so soon? - Grandma! My grandson... Grandma! I'm sorry for coming late. You should stay here for a week until Eid. Yes, grandma. Arthur, come greet the others. Hello, everybody. If there's a pretty girl like her, even a month won't matter. He just got here... Hey! What are you doing holding her hand? No. - How are you? - I'm fine. Dika. He's Ida's favorite grandson. But he rarely visits. - Don't you fast? - I forgot. My grandson doesn't fast. Catch it, grandpa. - One more time, grandma. - Okay. Be careful, grandpa is old. I'm sorry, Rina. - Be careful, grandpa. - Smile, grandma. - Again, grandpa! - Okay, Dika! Open it up, then fill it up. Slowly. Yes, I can. Slowly. I can do it, right? Can you really see it? I can if it's this close. I admire you. Your parents have died. And you have to take care of Dika. I really don't expect this. It's spilled. It's okay. I'll clean it up. - Really? - Yes, please take it easy. Ambar. I'm sorry. I couldn't make it to the funeral. It's alright, I understand. It's me who has to thank you and Aunt Wati for having me here. We are happy to have you here. You make this place lively. Right, Rina? Agus! Could you get my watch from the kitchen? Yes, grandma. Ambar, come. Put this. Look. If this thing sounds, that means someone is asking for help. If you need help, just press the bell, this one. Okay. Rina? What's the matter? Why did you hold her hand like that? We are friends since we were little. Put it there. No, not there. What's the matter with you? During the fasting month, the ghosts are locked up. So we have to clean this up too. Take a picture with the drinks too, grandpa. Dika, pick that up! - One, two... - No, no, don't. - It's dangerous. - You're not fun. Don't do that. Just catch this. Chase it! Wait. We'll take a picture first. One, two, three. Catch this, grandpa! - Grandma. - Yes? Here, grandpa. Grandpa. Let's go inside. It's going to rain. Grandpa! The frisbee went inside. Just leave it. We'll take it tomorrow. It's going to rain. Really? Arthur, fetch Dika. Dika! What are you doing here? It's going to rain. Let's go inside. The frisbee is there. It's raining now. Just leave it there. Let's take it. Okay, let's find the door. Slowly, be careful. Here's the door. Dika! Yes? Oh my! What is he doing there? Dika! I'm here! Dika! - Dika! - Ambar! The rain is so heavy, go inside! Dika! Dika! Dika. It's Arthur, right? You're scaring me! - Don't be so jumpy! - He broke the door. Ms. Wati always locks up this place. This is the first time I'm here. Ambar, does your boyfriend has any plan to visit you? Or, you don't have one? Dika, you have found your toy, right? Let's go home. Dika. What are you doing? Let's go home. Dika. Wow, so cool. There are lots of things here. There are many things. Don't touch anything. It looks dirty. What is this? Lots of old stuff. Ambar! - Arthur! Help! - Ambar! - Ambar! - Ambar! - Ambar! - Ambar! What is this? Shit. Ambar... Come on. Ambar. Slowly, Dika! - Ambar, are you okay? - Ambar, are you okay? - Are you hurt? - No, I'm alright. Are you sure? You fell from a high place. No, I'm alright. Thanks. Shit. Looks like the wood has decayed. Ouch! What is this place? I can't believe there is a place like this. What is that? - Come here. - Be careful. - See this. - What is this? It looks like a gramophone. An early model gramophone. You turn this and it will emit sounds. Like an old compo? Something like that. There's a pot here. I think all of the pots upstairs were made here. The tools are there. What is this thing? A chest! - A chest? - It's locked. - Is there something in it? - Yes, there must be something in it. But how can we open it? What is this? Be careful. What is that, Ambar? What is that, Arthur? This... It's a statue, right? Why is it headless? Let's go back, Ambar. Ambar? Dika? - We're downstairs, Agus. - Come down here. Wow, what is this place? Ambar, Dika, Arthur? I just knew there is a basement here. Agus, come here. There is something interesting. There is a chest. It surely contains gold. Gold? Really? - Let's take this upstairs. - Good idea. If it contains gold, we'll split them in two. Split it in three, brother. Okay. - Ambar, do you want to bring the statue too? - No, I don't. - Is there a statue? - Yes. Why should we take that statue home? Help me, it's heavy. Ambar, let's go. Ambar, Dika, let's go. Ambar, let's go. Ambar? Let's go, Ambar. Fasting till the last day feels so good. I'm sorry. The cuts quite deep. - How can we open it? - Alright, let's try. Maybe we need a screwdriver. It's for the sores. Thank you. There, it's opened. What is this? What is this, bro? Not bad. Ambar, there are lots of things in here. Many things. What is that? It is called a plate. It was called a plate back then. Now it's called a record. It was a cassette in the old days. Like the one there? But why it's called a plate? Strange. It is an old term. They made a mess. I don't like it. - Agus. - Yeah? - Come here. - Who is it, grandpa? She's pretty, right? Whose things are those? The owner must be a Dutchman who lived here. Don't take someone's belonging. Especially if it belongs to someone from long time ago. It might have something in it. Ani, watch your mouth. Do you still believe in those things? - The Japanese and the Dutch are already gone. - You don't understand! What if there is something in it? I understand, it's you who doesn't understand. - Stop it, please. - Calm down, grandma. - She's always like that. Old fashioned. - Calm down now. Tomorrow is Eid. She knows that and yet she got mad. It's your fault. Why did you bring it here? - It made them fight. - Yes, my bad. Do you know that song, Dika? Head, shoulder... ...knees and toes. Right. Let's all dance. Come on, Ambar. Let's dance! Let's dance. - Come on. - I don't want to. It's fun! Be careful, grandma. What happened? Agus? - Agus? - Yes, grandpa. - Ambar? - Dika. Check it outside. Maybe the fuse tripped. It's okay, Dika. What is this? Come on. Are the neighbors' light also out? I will check it out. Looks like it's scheduled blackout as usual. It's usual for a secluded place like ours. How can this happen on Eid night? How come? Ambar, do you miss mom and dad? I do. Very much. How about you? Me too. I hope you like it here. There is a scary well in the backyard. Really? Yes, a well. You don't see anything strange? No. I didn't see anything. I think that song was strange. Spooky. I don't like to hear it. Let's not talk about it. Go to sleep. It's already late. Go to sleep. Grandpa? Grandma? You're scaring me! I'm sorry, dear. I'm sorry. Is it cooked? Almost. I will wake up at three. I don't have the energy to finish it now. I'm very sleepy. Is everybody asleep? They should be. But I haven't checked Ambar's room. It's Ambar again and again. Don't be mad. She's like my own sister. Since when you have a sister? Did you meet her when she's already old? An imaginary sister? I like it when you're sulking. Who is that? Check it. Quick. Who is it? I don't know. Let's go back to our room. Honey. Agus? Rina? Who are you? Who are you? Let's get out of here. I will pick you up. Help! Help. What's the matter? Ambar? Ambar? The light was on. What are you seeing? Nothing. Come on. What did you see there? No, I didn't see anything. Let's go to sleep. Rina? Ida? Who played the music? It's noisy. Rina? Agus? Agus? Rina? Agus? Agus always puts them in the middle of the way. Agus? Yes, dear? Why didn't you wake me up? Why are you mad so early in the morning? I didn't heat the food last night. It's become stale. A bad soup is bad omen. Calm down. There is another meal. And what we will eat the rice cake with? With chili? - Just clean it up and help me cook. - Okay, okay. What shall I cook? - Where is the other pan? - It's in the usual place, Rina. Ambar, Dika. Please sit down. I think it wasn't this messy yesterday. We didn't go for the Eid prayer. I woke up at dawn, but then I slept again. We didn't go for the Eid prayer. Did you wake up again? Did you wake up? I heard the sound of intercom last night. Did anybody call last night? The intercom sounded? The light was out. But the intercom sounded. But strangely, no one called. And it was from the kitchen. - Agus? - Yes, grandpa. What is it? What is this statue? Why is it here? So strange. How can it be here? Who brought it? You did this, right? Maybe... Don't tell me... This... What is this statue? - Not me. - You brought this. Don't act surprised. Yesterday you said not to bring it here. - But you brought it anyway. - I was in the kitchen. Look, the door is open. You must have done it. No, it's not me. Arthur, don't be kidding. It must be you who brought that here. Impossible. It was raining last night. I wouldn't want to get wet just to bring it here. There is no way that statue can walk by itself. Grandpa! Don't fight now. Remember, it's still Eid today. Hear that? It is still Eid today. Why don't you go back to the pavillion? Agus, take it back, will you? Ambar. Apparently, this is a diary of a Dutch woman. She used to live here. I just read a part of it. The Dutch woman lived in this house since she was a little. Her parents loved Indonesia and its people. They even gave an Indonesian name to her youngest brother. Tragedy came to the family. Her brother was murdered. Her mother got sick, and then she died. Her father committed suicide. Poor woman. Have you seen strange things in this house? What do you mean? Ambar has never told anyone about this. Since I had eye surgery... ...my eyes are sensitive to the things... ...that nobody can see. So you can sense supernatural things? Last night I saw something. But strangely... ...I could see clearly this time. Everything was clear. And even stranger... ...I heard that Dutch song on the intercom. Then I saw the Dutch woman. Once more, grandma. Smile, please. - Smile! - Yes, that's it. Keep it up, grandma. Beautiful! One, two, three. Very beautiful, grandma. - Ambar, Dika, let's take a picture. - Sorry, I'm late. It's okay. Please sit. Come here, Dika. It's ketupat! Sit with grandma. Rina, Agus, let's take a picture. Come on, gather up! Let's take a picture. Smile! One, two, three. Beautiful. One more time. Where is Grandma Ani? You're right. - Haven't you checked? - I was busy in the kitchen. I thought you have checked. Let's take another picture. Look here, all of you. Look here and smile as usual. One, two, three. Grandma. Grandma. Grandma? Is Grandma Ani here? She's not in her room. I'm so scared. She's not in the backyard either. We have to look for her. Arthur, help us find her. Let's go. - Grandma Ani! - Ani! Grandma! You go that way, grandma. - Ani! - Grandma Ani! Grandma! - She's not in the backyard? - Nope. Check in there. Grandma! Grandma Ani! - Grandma? - Grandma Ani! Grandma Ani? Grandma? Grandma Ani? Grandma? Grandma Ani? Grandma? Grandma? Grandma Ani? Grandma Ani? Grandma... Who is that? Let's go. - I think it's Ambar. - Dika, come on! Hurry up! Grandma Ani? Grandma Ani! Don't you feel strange? How come the statue is there? I don't know either. But it's strange indeed. Come, I'm right here. Just be calm. Promise me, Ambar. That we will leave this place... ...if you see strange things. What's important is that we always stay together. We will be fine. Agus, open the door. Grandma wants to go. Grandma, just stay inside. It's raining outside. Agus, open it up! Open it! Arthur, be patient please. If you and the others want to stay, that's your choice. That's okay. As for me, I want to make sure my grandma and myself are safe. So open the door now! Open the door! Where is the key? Stop it! - Now is not the time to fight. - Be patient! I don't feel safe here, grandpa. There is a dead elderly person with no head. Where will you go? What will you ride? We all have to leave this place! This place is dangerous. You cannot bring your grandma like this. Agus, Grandma Ani was murdered. She's headless. Do you want to leave her body just like that? This is not only about you. This is about my family. Everybody here, including you, is my family. My responsibility. We will wait here. I have called the police. Agus. Agus. I don't feel safe here. Please open the door. Grandma, the police will come shortly. You must not walk so far. Please, grandma. Please. I'm begging you to stay here. Come on. Listen. If we stay together in this place, we will be safe. Believe it! And what if the killer is still here? Do you want us to have the same fate as her? Arthur! Let him be. What took the police so long to come? Maybe it's because of the Eid holiday. Not everybody is working. I want to go home. Yes, grandma. It won't be long. That statue. Did somebody move it? Are you kidding? Look. I know you're the one who brought the statue here, right? Right? Listen. Just think of it. Why should I bring that thing? And I wasn't kidding, that statue wasn't there just now. Enough! I believe Arthur. Last night the Dutch song suddenly played on the intercom. I saw that Dutch woman in the kitchen. You saw it? What do you mean by that? I can see things you can't. Just stop it, Ambar. Today is already chaotic. I have never seen anything strange while I'm here. So please don't make the situation worse. Good evening. I'm from Cimaju Police station. Did somebody call? Hi, everybody. I'm Yudi. My condolences. I'm sorry to come late. It is the rain. The weather makes the trip here difficult. It is very unfortunate to have someone die on Eid itself. It's alright, Mr. Yudi. I'm sorry, but did you come alone? Yes. Have you called for the ambulance? The deceased grandma... ...was she sick or she had a heart attack? That? Are you okay? HQ, come in. HQ? I need back up. The Dutch woman that Ambar meant... ...was the writer of this diary. Who is this? Let me see. It is written here that he was the leader of the Japanese army. His name was Matsuya. Come in, HQ! I need back up. I need back up, there is a homicide. Damn! Hey! Who's there? It looks like Matsuya was close to the Dutch woman. She said that she used to be a Jugun ianfu. Poor woman. - Jugun ianfu? - Yes. Japanese comfort woman. - Where is the phone? - Right there, sir. Maybe the killer is still in the vicinity. - It's disconnected. - It was on. Ambar. Let's just stay here. But it's not safe here. Just listen to them. We have to leave this place as soon as possible. The statue. Looks like another scheduled blackout. Where is the electrical panel? - It's behind the building. - We will go there. Maybe somebody shuts the light on purpose. All of you stay here... ...and lock every door. Come with me. - Help me for a moment. - Okay. - Help me for a moment. - I heard you. - Here. - Thank you. That's what I'm telling you all. No one believes me. I should not be here. Everybody, take a rest. What's the matter, Dika? The statue, it moved. It stood up. Why is the gramophone on? Ambar? Come, quickly! Don't make a sound. We have to go out now. Ambar? How come it's on? Let's go now. - Let's go to the kitchen. - We have to go now. We don't have time. - Let's come here. - They will come! Ambar. Please help! What are you doing? What are you doing? Let her go! Grandpa, what's going on? Ambar, did you see something? That woman is hit and dragged away. Let go! Please go now! What is that sound? Maybe it's the sound of the vision that Ambar saw here. Go away, all of you! No matter what, she is Dutch. They made us suffer. Damn you all! That woman was tortured... ...by our people. By the native people. Don't move! Don't move! Show her... ...that we are more powerful than their people. They have made you suffer for hundreds of years. What's that, Ambar? There is a Japanese soldier coming towards them. I promised... ...to help you all. But... ...you are not a part of them. Have a taste of this betrayal! They want you dead. Your love toward them... ...means nothing anymore. Each drop of my blood... ...will make your life miserable. I'm afraid. Here, stay with me. It's off! I will kill you all! Bastards! Whose voice is that? Ambar? Ambar? Where are you going? Ambar? Ambar. Where are you going? Use the umbrella. Ambar! Wait up! Be careful! Ambar. What are you doing here? He went inside. That statue. I believe Ambar. What is this? Where are you all going? Bring grandma in, Dika. What's going on? It is not safe inside, Agus. We saw strange things. He went here. Who is he? What is this room? What's the matter with Ambar? Ambar can see things that happened in the past. What is that? It is the shadow that we saw upstairs. Maybe this is connected with the death of grandma Ani. What do you mean? Why is it on? How come is it on? What's he doing? Do you still remember... ...the song we used to sing in the front yard? I will always savor your mom's dishes. I will always remember how your mom and dad loved us. But... ...your love for this country... ...made you suffer instead. What is that, Ambar? He made her into a statue. And her body is inside the statue. So is the statue upstairs? I will always remember you. Forgive me. Every drop of your blood will make their life uneasy. - Where are you going? - Ambar, where are you going? - Wait up! - Ambar. The man is going upstairs. What do you see, Ambar? What's the matter? What's the matter, Ambar? Damn you all! What's the matter? What's the matter? That man was hit and dragged. Ambar, why did the chair fall? It wasn't like this, right? Be careful, sir. So strange. What's that? What shall we do? Let's go upstairs! What shall we do? Go, all of you! Let's go upstairs! Hurry up, go upstairs! Agus! Rina! - Quickly! - Agus! Hurry up! We have to get away from here! Everybody, get into my car! Quickly, everybody! Rina, we have to go! - Rina, let's go! - I won't leave Agus! Help grandma! Ambar, quickly! Run, quickly! Quick! It won't start! Please hurry up! What's going on? What's going on? It turns on by itself. Quick, start the car! Every drop of my blood... - ...will make your life miserable. - Turn it off! Return my head! That! She's behind us! She's coming towards us! Return my head! She's gone! Lock the door! Lock it! Grandma! Ida! I can't open it! Help! Grandma! Arthur! Grandma... - Arthur! - Grandma! Grandma! Arthur! Arthur! Arthur! Arthur... We have to walk. If we get out, we will die! What must we do? She wants our heads. Maybe we should destroy the statue? We should go back inside. Quickly! Let's destroy it! Now! What is it, Ambar? That Japanese soldier... ...dumped her head in the well. The well in the backyard. Ambar! Dika! We'll take it there! We'll destroy it there! Be careful. He dumped her head here. We will destroy it here. Take that axe. Get those alcohol bottles! - Alcohol? - There's no time for discussion, quick! Quick! What is that? Ambar is right. Her body is in this statue. We'll dump it inside the well. We'll burn it there. Get those bottles! The jerrycan. Quick. Take that! Come on! Now we burn it! Where's the match? Burn it! Damn! It's in the car! Quickly, sir! Get the match in the kitchen! Dika! Ambar! Dika, Ambar! Wait there! Dika! Dika! Rina! Ambar! Ambar and Dika fell. Dika! All of you will die! - They fell! - How come? Dika, Ambar! Dika! Ambar! Dika. Where are you? Dika... Where are you? Dika! Where are you? Ambar! Dika! - Where's the match? - Here. Just throw the match! Throw the match! Throw the match, Rina! Dika! Ambar! Ambar! Dika! Ambar! Ambar... Return my head! Dika... Ambar! Ambar! Ambar! Ambar? Ambar. Are you alright? Ambar! Hey, are you alright? Help will come, calm down. One week later Did all the residents move out, ma'am? Yes. But since that incident there are only a few who live here. That incident was very shocking. The news was everywhere. Luckily there are survivors. We are moving to another location. Anything else, sir? Grandpa. - This too. - Just this, sir? Yes, I will take this to the car. This woman, who is she with? Let me see. Looks like it's her sister. Dimas, Elizabeth, Ivanna. - Let's go, Ambar. - Yes. Let's go, grandpa.
