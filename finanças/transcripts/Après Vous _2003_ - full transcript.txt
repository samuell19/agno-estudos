Sugar, sugar. I'm really sorry. I hope you're not angry? I'll see you there. Excuse me. Christine. Well then, no more apologies. I'll leave right now. I'll take the shortcut by the park. You were supposed to leave 1 hour ago. I hate this. I couldn't, Mercier wants another butcher. Why do we have to change the supplier? - We'll talk tomorrow. - It's strange, no? I'll talk to Serge. We must talk, Serge. Is everything OK? - Yes sir. - Everything will be fine. - Waiter. - Yes, commissioner? Give this to the new boy. Excuse me, please. I asked the boy for roast duck. The boy? OK. Roasted duck! Shit, what a stupid idiot! Shit! No! Leave me! No, leave me alone! My hair! My nose! Are you OK? Are you OK now? - Hello. - I can't now. I'm on my way. Don't know... I'll order an appetizer. You don't have to eat all the bread. I'm sorry, I can't speak. I have to hang-up, I'm on my way. My fiance's waiting, I'm really late. She's been at the restaurant for more than an hour. They won't serve her anything. Only... ...cold plates at the entrance. OK... goodbye mister. Do you have a place to sleep? He lives outside. He doesn't have work. I'm not lying to you. He needs company. It's normal. - He feels bad too. - Wait a second. Everything alright? Are you OK? Sure, come on over... We'll be waiting for you. Genius. Would you like something? Something light? - How was your day? - Good, a lot of work. But it's getting better. At noon we had 75, 76. Some arrived late, but, they ate at the entrance. How is the chicken? Dead. - I can't live through tomorrow. - Is it too difficult? I won't survive it. Breathing hurts me. Every breath, it's terrible. Anyone else would have done the thing same in your situation. - For me, it was... like a reflection. - I understand. - I'm sorry. Don't take it personally. You couldn't know. Thanks. I would pay somebody to do it. - If I could, I'd do it. - Thanks. You're welcome. - Do you have friends in Paris? - No. Maybe some relative who can help you? Oh, Shit! - What? - Shit, Shit. What's wrong? Perhaps I can help. Yesterday, I sent a letter to my grandparents. - You did? - Oh No! - To warn them. They're the ones who raised me. I wanted to explain to them how I felt. Are they old? - 87 and 89. - Shit, Shit, Shit. - Let's go. - What? It's Sunday. The letter, it won't arrive until tomorrow. Let's go. Where do they live? Near St. Malo. What are you doing? - He's not from Paris. I'm going to take him home. - Now? - Yes, he's feeling bad... he needs it. - Where does he live? What? Where doe's he live? Near St. Malo. That's enough, Antoine. What going on? It's important. I must take him home. This guy? He's not your cousin. I don't even know his name. Are you tired? I had a difficult day at the restaurant. Do you want me to drive? I'm OK. I'm OK now, talking helped. - Which house is it? - Just there where the mailman is. Perhaps they left. Where to? An expo? Perhaps they haven't read it yet. - Let's go. - I can't. - Yes you can, let's go! - I can't. I'm a friend of... ...I'm a friend of... your grandson. He asked me to come... ...because he needs... ...his birth certificate. - You know Louis? - Oh good! Heaven must have sent you to help while my husband is gone. It's an incredible coincidence. The mailman said that Louis sent this... They've operated on my eye & I can't see a thing. The last time he wrote was during some scholastic excursion. Sit, please. Sit, please. There's no problem. You can read it. You are his friend. "Grandmother Rose, Grandfather Jacques" "I believe I'm going mad, I'm tired & sad." Grandmother Rose, Grandfather Jacques. I hope that you are well. "I want to die." I'm very well. What can I say? What can I say? Not much. Not much. Yes, I do have something to tell you. Everything goes well. Work is OK. "I can't stand it anymore." I'm very well... just a little intestinal problem. I have a lot of very sympathetic friends. I'm feeling loved, I love my work. I am a personal assistant... ...for someone, I can't read the name on the letter. Sentimentally, I'm better. I am finally over my separation from Blanche. Incredible! I can't believe it. Yes, yes, I had already forgotten. I met a girl, Carmen. She's pretty, intelligent &, very amusing... ...& she has a beautiful body. She studies Economy... ...and the Internet. - "& now I want to die." - What? - I must go now. - You have to leave already? A big hug, your Louis. Not much more than in the excursion letter. - Are you leaving already? - Yes, I have to work. I'd like to go see my sister. I would be very grateful if you could take me. I must say something... I'm very pleased. Very pleased... I thought that Louis would never tell us how he felt. - Beautiful day, isn't it? - You know Blanche? I've only known Louis a short time. I have a terrible confession. It must remain between us. It's a pretty town. A nice place to live, don't you think? I never told Louis. Blanche called me once. She thought that I would appreciated it & she wanted my advice. She felt that she was hurting Louis. That his life was a disaster... ...that he was always worried... nervous... fragile... I said to her that she'd made a poor devil out of him... that there was no love between them... ...& that the best thing she could do was to leave him. So, even though she didn't believe it was for the best, she took her things... ...& disappeared quietly into the next night. - You hear that? - It was only a sack. I felt bad. I thought I'd exaggerated. That particular day everything had gone wrong, I was terribly irritated. I'll leave you here. If he knew it, he would have thanked me. Without a doubt. Goodbye. I can't believe it. - You heard what she said? - Yes. She told her she must leave me. The woman of my life, the light of my eyes... ...& she said that she must leave me. And, I had to live to hear it. I'm sorry. - Are you OK? - No. - I must go. - Where to? To work. I'm late. Can I stay here for a while? - In the car? - I'm not feeling well. Come-in with me. You can eat something, soup, sandwich... - I'm not hungry. - Come-in with me. I can't have guests, but um... Enter alone & behave like a normal customer. A client. - Is it far? - 20 meters. Can we go in the car? Take table No 7. At noon there are a lot single people. - You were at the party? - I slept bad. Change that table cloth. - Sir? - I'll take it. Good day sir, are you alone? I don't have money. One steak with potatoes... ...kidney beans & mineral water. Take it. - I feel like everybody's watching me. - Nice to see you. Stop being nice. You'll make me cry. I don't have the energy to eat. - Want a yogurt? - No, thanks. - What's wrong? - Nothing, everything's OK. I'm frightened that's going to fall on me. It is like vertigo, but the other way around. Do you want another table? I'm going to wash my face then, I'm going back to the car. - I hope that doesn't bother you. - No. Blanche! You saved him but, you can't take charge of him. Plus, you did the right thing. What else could you do? Adopt him? - Shit, say something, Antoine. - You're right. Change that face then. Sorry. Can you do it? If you want to help him, you must use a little pressure. - If you don't press, it's useless. - OK then, I'll do it. You take care of that bandage, & I'll return immediately. - Would you do me a favor? - What do you want. They don't want to give me morphine. Would you connect me to his? - He's sleeping, he won't notice. - You're crazy. - Please. - No. Antoine... I need it. I can't believe it. Look at you. You must get out & start meeting people. Christ! How does this work? Get to work, return to society. Feel anything? - Thanks. - No need to thank me, your welcome. Antoine... I adore you. Antoine... - ...you're a genius. - Thank-you. - Do you think she forgot me? - One can not forget, one who loves. She's probably married. She always wanted to marry. I don't know. Perhaps not. I like your jacket. It suits you very well. What are you doing! These bottles are worth a fortune. I was trying it. Perhaps that's the problem here. - Do I seem stupid? - Tell her, Antoine. He knows everything. Quiet! I'm not in the mood for jokes! You smell like a distillery! I don't want to see you here anymore! I assure you, if Jean was still alive, this would cost you very dearly. Perfect! Antoine, the address you asked for. Incredible! Thank-you commissioner. It's on me. I wanted to know at what hour you close. At 9 p. M. It says so on the door, sir. Thank-you. Just a second. Blanche, it's for you! - They canceled the order. - What? They're having a simple wedding, without a celebration or flowers. It can't be, & I didn't request an advance. What happened? - The mother of the fiancee died. - Perhaps the bride could sell wreaths. You won't believe me, but, I need flowers for a wedding. You arrived at just the right moment. It's for my brothers wedding. It's urgent. Can you fix something up? I'll make the price 120 euros instead of 150. Thank-you very much. & 1 tulip. - Where do I put this? - There. - Multiplied by 5... - By 5? - I have 5. Need more? - No, fives perfect. - That's 600 euros exactly. - Exactly. The tulips are free. Thank-you very much. Here, take this. No, thank-you, you really saved me. - Don't exaggerate. - We could have used them. They wouldn't have lasted that long. - That long? - Until the 22nd, less than 3 weeks. For you, they will be perfect. - What will happen on the 22nd? - She'll put me in chains. Are you having regrets? Sorry, just kidding. I brought you your clothes. That jacket you like. I don't want to go. I want to stay here. Besides I'm not cured, & I can see a tunnel of light. I can't believe it. You're delirious, Louis. You removed his morphine again. You can't keep doing this. I need your social security card, please. Just a second. Excuse us, it's his treatment. Behave yourself. - Your social security card. - I don't have it. - What's your number? - 9. I also like 7. Please, what's your social security number. It's been years, I don't have it. - You don't have it? - I was never ill. 4,000 euros... 28,000 francs! You're crazy! You owe him nothing. You saved him! I only wanted to help. Not everyone wants to be helped. He failed at love. It's normal. He's upset because she left him. Nobody commits suicide for that reason. It's not so simple. He's intense, violent, & a terrible humiliation. - A wounded narcissist. - What? A wounded narcissist. Wounds can be healed. If you work & meet people, you will heal. He doesn't want to know people, or work, either. We have an interview on Friday. He wants to give me the money back. He's a decent type. I never said the opposite. Could you take him a suit from the store? Now I must dress him. - What the matter? - Nothing. Tell me. We been together 3 years. You could have remembered. I thought that you'd forgotten. Come... See... - You thought I'd forgotten? - Oh, my, Antoine! - They are beautiful. - Thank-you. - What? - Antoine... my Antoine. - What? - I say yes, yes, yes. I say yes, yes. Your curriculum is interesting. You were highly recommended & your test was perfect. Very pleased. We'll call you soon. Good luck in Sancerre. He's good, I liked him. - I wanted to see Mr. Letoux. - He's a bit tardy. He has a long trip. He's sommelier at "Roche Noires" in Biarritz. - I don't know him. - He has good references. He needs a clock. No, I don't want too, I'm not going. You can't do this to him. - Don't say that, that makes it worse. - Your late. Not working does not make me an ass & it won't help to heal my wounds. Calm down, he will be there. - I must pee. - You went 4 times already. - Are the shoes OK? - They're tight. Take a seat. We will do 2 of the usual recognition tests. What is this? Have we already begun? Excuse me. I would say... Cote du Rhone, "97." - Hospice de Gigondas. - Very good. That wasn't easy. What would you recommend with white Chateau Bonnet? Red deer. Good idea. Very original. - I would never of thought of that. - What are you saying? - The hunting meat goes well. - Lobster! But the red deer is good idea. It emphasizes the flavor... ...of the red deer. Can you tell us your work philosophy? Wine is something important. Good wine goes with food at the party. Wine gives magic to the food... ...& enlightens the heart. It's like a guide. Like a guide. In the noblest sense of the word. I like to show all that, when I recommend a wine. To me he seemed good, rather experimenting. The previous applicant seemed better to me. He was too arrogant. It'll bother the customers. I like an artist. - He gives off fear. - I vote for him. Then I agree, let's try him. They are ordered by region & by year. The ceiling is a bit low. It's a cellar. - Must I come here all alone? - I will be near. - Here are those of the guard. - Of whom? The guard. They are the best ones. - These are the regions. - You see how many there are? Don't worry, people don't know anything. Just say: "I have an excellent borgoña for a very good price." Antoine, telephone! How strange, he's following him everywhere. - This is Blanche Grimaldi. The florist. You forgot to sign the check. I can pass by there... No, don't bother, that's not necessary. I'm already going that way. I'll be there immediately. Look. Look. - Are you leaving? - I won't be long. They look Siamese. You can't leave me now! If you go, I'll be forced to leave this employment. I'll be back in half an hour. If you have problems, tell Karine. - Will you return? - Yes! Hello. You were quick. Pardon me, I have to fix everything before my voyage. - You're leaving? - Yes, 15 days to Ireland. Doesn't it rain a lot there? Here you go. You must understand. You think I'm a stupid idiot. You think that I don't realize? No, I respect you. I'm sorry. I forgot something, I need plants for the house... It's important. - Sure. Which ones do you want? Those... - Would you do me a favor? - Yes. Could you take them to my car? I must make an urgent call. - I'll do it. - Thanks. It's in the alley. The Mazda. - Can I use your telephone? - Yes. We changed the supplier? ...That also, please. That's a surprise, I didn't know anything about it. An inauguration now? ...With that company? No, it doesn't please me, absolutely not. That also. I can't, I can't. You have ethics, sir. - It's broken. - It's only one flowerpot. I'm not feeling good. Excuse me, I need to sit. - My love, excuse me. - I'm with a client. - I think I can fix it. - Yes, sure. - It's not what you think. - & what is it? Nothing. You're wrong. You were laying down in the truck with her, weren't you. Laying down? No. Let's talk. - Talk? - She forced me to kiss her. Yea, sure. It's the truth. We were talking. It's perfectly normal, ...no ...sir? I would't know... Let's go Blanche. Let's forget it. Let's go home. I don't love her. It don't care. Go away! Blanche, I love you. It's best you leave. Where do I hide? I can't believe it. Roasted duck. I'll call the sommelier. - What did you order? - I requested roast duck. I have an excellent borgona... for a very good price. Perfect. & for the codfish? I have excellent borgona... for a very good price. Very good. - Should I be sad or angered? - Angered. I'm terrified to remain alone! Better alone than in bad company. I prefer to be in bad company. I hate the proverbs. Excuse me, you are very amiable. The idea to pardon him is tempting but, how will you watch him tomorrow? When he goes to buy cigarettes you will ask... ...if he's not making love... ...on the porch, ...or in a hotel, or a car. - Enough. - Sorry. - You will find another person. - I know it. But it loved him, you do understand? If I didn't, I wouldn't have bought the wedding dress. He's sad. I will make him happier. - I'm sorry. - It's not your fault. - I must go, it's late. - Sure, go. You helped me a lot, thank-you. Thank-you very much. Hello, commissioner. He takes usual, the "95. I'll change the table cloth." Louis will bring another bottle. The "95's are bad..." - & Louis? - Follow the spots. - Hello, Louis? - I forgot everything you told me. - Is all going well. - You left me alone. It's pathetic! - Sommelier! - Shit, these people! - I have new information. You are going to adore me. - What? You'll see. We'll have supper with Karine. You choose where. - I know a Thailand restaurant. - Perfect. Supper with champagne. Hello. A glass of champagne? I want to speak with you. The artist must go away. - Why? No. - Yes. - Don't do that. - All the wine is on the tablecloths. - You must tell him he's fired. - Later. Later. Later? When? I have good news. It'll alleviate the bad. What news? Let's wait for the champagne. - Well? - Just a second. - Well? - What? - Well? The news. - You have the job. - You're joking. Everything went well. Mrs. Mougins adores to you. You seem to her very... very... creative. - It surprises me. - Me too. - Happy? - Yes, I create that. - You deserved it, Louis. - I tried several things. - I felt near the people. - I know. It was a good relationship &, I believe that she felt it. Without a doubt. - She's happy with me. - Yes. She doesn't show it but, I noticed that she was. If she really wants me, I could request a raise. - Wait. - He's very prudent. That's incredible. I didn't think that I could be so happy. Sure, sure. If Blanche could see me. I'll be right back. You know, Louis? Perhaps I'm wrong, but, I think that Karine likes you. - You noticed that. - Yes? - She's a pain. - Why? On the contrary! I'm not available. I must confess something to you. This restaurant was ours. - Blanche & I always ate here. - Really? I never had the guts to come back here before. You're... making progress. - Marvelous, he has already sold 2 today. - Really? & also, 1 Yquem, 700 euros in wine. He's heating-up. Tell me, Antoine. You told him already? - Not yet. When we close. - For now, don't say anything. No comments, please. Do you enjoy watching? Wait for me downstairs. I'll bring you a Seguret. A delight. It's on the house. - Now what happens? - Without her I'm useless. It's worse. I think about her. I think of her body, her skin... ...pale & luminous. You know? When she was nervous... ...or when she was excited... ...she'd get red spots on her neck. The restaurant is full. We must return. I can't, Antoine. I feel awful. - I'll wait for you in the car. - But this is the worse time! I don't care. - Don't do this to me. - I'm not well! Don't be egotistical! What? I'm the egotist? I take care of you all day. I help you in everything, everything. You're the egotist. What will you do to me? - I'm going to kill you. - As you wish. - I was passing by, how are you? - Very nice of you. I'm well, thanks. - It's that, I feel responsible. - No, don't be. Yes, but... Anyway, I wanted to wish you good luck. Thanks. - You must be strong. - Why? And... because surely he will invite you in. He will buy you flowers, he will try to reconquer you. We're all the same. And, we don't do this for love... ...but, because we are angered & hurt. It's called "hurt narcissist." - Are you OK? - Yes. I can't! You 'make' me drink. After 3 glasses, I'll do anything. You don't love me, you're angered & wounded. It's a narcissistic wound. Fuck the flowers! I have piles. I sold the tulips, for 3 euros! - Everything OK? - Brilliant! - What will I do now? - You'll get over it. - I'll be suffering all alone. - No, come, meet people. - Which people? - People you can trust. I don't know. People who really want to get to know you. Who? - Do you want to have dinner? - I can't. - You're occupied? - Is not that. I'm afraid to be alone, I'll yield. I'm not easy but, I'm very nice. - You're here? - I wanted to surprise you. - You robbed them? - No, I paid them. Open one. I will but, you can't tell anyone. Are you joking? No, a supplier came & Martine couldn't receive it. He just called, - I have to go. - I only see you Sundays. We'll eat together tomorrow. I'm happy that you're here. Louis can't remain alone, he's depressed, he'll drink a lot of wine. Are you joking? - Are you joking? - Lower. You propose marriage then you disappear? I'm worried about him. & now you leave me with him? You don't even come to me with flowers! - I didn't think of it. - I thought of giving them back to you. But I changed my mind after your proposal. I thought that perhaps you loved me. I was obviously mistaken. He can have you... - ...the better for me! - And who can I count on? Do you think that I want to go to work now? We had an appointment? No. So, why do you say these things? - You aren't even ashamed. - No, but I am exhausted! - That smells good. - I prepared dinner. - Ah! Wonderful. - I'm going to throw it in the street. It doesn't matter, we'll find it. I was angry with you, even though it was his fault. - That was stupid. - No, I understand. Now I'm thankful. In some way, you saved me. I only bought plants. I thought a lot about what you said to me... ...on looking for somebody to help. Why don't you try Louis? With whom? - With whom? - With Louis. - You mentioned him other day. - I mentioned him? Yes, the first day, in the store. No. Yes. You were upset. You said... "Louis, I ..." "I'm tired of suffering" Who is that Louis? - I don't remember anything, that's incredible. - Perhaps it means something. - I don't think so... Louis was pure emotion, an eddy. If you knew him, you'd understand. - Perhaps he's changed. - Have you seen him recently? No, I have enough problems. I must learn to be alone. My problem is that I always see a persons good side... ...& don't see the bad. Do I have spots? Red spots? No. Yes, some... Very few... Petite ones. Nothing to worry about. Excuse me. It's from the flowers. I'm allergic. Be right back. Leave it open. It's more sensual. - What are you doing here? - I was hungry. Louis suggested we come here. & you? To me also. In the kitchen. & where... are you seated? - Near the window. - & your supplier? The one in the white shirt. Don't tell Louis I'm here. He could ruin everything. - It's my fault. - No, it's my fault. I must return to him. Go. Go. Go, now. This one. - You don't remember me? - What? You haven't changed much. The hair, perhaps. That's good. I think... Good evening. - Christine, my fiance'. - Good evening. It wanted to give this to my fiance'. I haven't seen him all week. I'll leave now. Don't get too tired. - Monnet? You remember? Monnet? - You aren't dead? - As you can see. I won't bother you anymore, goodbye. Excuse me, an old friend. - For me? - Yes. Thank-you. Let's take coffee in a bar. Bill please. - Dessert? - No. Let's pass by your store. I need flowers. - You do? - Yes, really. - Something special? - To what do you refer? Flowers talk, you know. Roses say: "I love you." Peonies: "I will see you tonight." The anemones: "I feel it". - I need anemones. - Good. & roses. Half & half. "I love you & I feel it." Very masculine. Thank-you for the flowers. Kiss me. - Pardon? - Kiss me now. - I prefer not. - André returned, he's watching. Kiss me. - Thank-you. - You're welcome. - I'm going, Goodnight. - Goodnight. What are you doing? Going away? - No, hold the chair. - & what are you doing? - I'm taking my things, I'm leaving. There's not too much to take. - What happened? - She saw you with another woman. It was a friend. She said she's leaving you, that you don't love her. - & what did you said to her? - That I understand. You son of a bitch! After what I did for you! I have to go get her. Christine, Christine. Christine. That girl was Blanche, the one that belongs to Louis. - It's the truth, It was Blanche. - I believe you. - And? - You don't love me. If you loved me, you would told me the truth. I thought that you'd get angry. You're afraid of telling me the truth & of what my reaction will be. It's for that reason we're not living together, you're scared. Stay, stay with me for good. Marry me. Louis... I was angry, forgive me. I said things, I wasn't thinking, that's not a good reason to go. I need some air. - Only air? - What? You think I would kill myself for you? No, no. But, you are slightly out of you mind. You could have... Leave me alone, Antoine! He's not well, Antoine. What you want to do? I don't know... to help him find himself. & do you know if that's what he wants? Leave him alone. You're not helping him nor us either. - Perhaps you're right. - I'm sure I am. - Tell the truth to Blanche. - OK. Please, for me. - You promise? - Yes. That lamp is not good there. - I wanted to call you. - We must talk. - No, I want to apologize. - No, no need to apologize. I wanted to make it clear that everything's finished. I continued kissing you because he followed me there. Yes, of course, I could see that. It's for that reason I embraced you. In that way it was more real. & for that reason I caressed you're neck. & the hair. & the shoulders. & the hips. & the face. &, that I embraced you so strongly. - Then everything's clear now. - Yes. - Bye. - Bye. - She left you? - Yes. - She took the bed? - Yes, & the armchair. - Are you OK? - I think so. I'm going away, Antoine. You have done more for me than nobody... ...but, I'm damaging you. I don't know, perhaps it's contagious. It's for you. To remember me by. I put your name on. See you at work. Louis, I believe that now I can tell you. What? I found Blanche. - She's married? - No. I don't think so. She prefaces her last name as Miss. I can't breathe. You saw her? You saw Blanche? - From a distance. - Then you understand why I can't forget her. - I only saw her silhouette. - Let's go. - What? - Let's leave. - I can't. - Please. Wait a little while. She has to see that you've changed. Let's go, please. I want to see where she lives. Her shade behind the window... her house... ...4th floor. I'm going up. Wait. I only want to say hello. I won't be long, promise. 4th floor. You can't confront her & then go away. She left you, remember? - I'm changed. - Oh, yes. You said it. I'm going up. & what will you say to her? "I've changed, I'm a sommelier, can I stay?" Genius. Can you repeat that? - You'll scare her before even beginning, then what? You can't ruin everything in this way. Think a little. You must proceed with caution. Make her want you. Remain distant, mysterious. Doesn't that make more sense? Look. It's her. It's her! - Do you see her? - Yes, I see. - Who is that? - I don't know. Goddamn that son of a bitch, don't mess with my woman. - Calm down, he won't. - How do you know? - She doesn't love him. You can see that. - From what? The position of the body. It's not frontal. How? - From the profile, it means that she rejects him. - You swear? - I swear. Blanche, Blanche. Profile, profile. Profile, profile. - I told you. - From now on, I'll listen to you. With you're help, I'll get her back. I'll kill him. He forced her! - You didn't have to take me. - You wanted to go. - You said she was single. - I said she wasn't married. - She can have relations. - Don't say that. Shit, now I can see them. Shit, shit! Why do you have to say that? Now, I can't think of anything else! Excuse me. I must go get her. You can't do that... don't force things. The other guy did. Profile or not, she's in his bed. - No, no, no? - Yes. - I knew you had another woman. - That's not true. Better to be single than have a bad mate. I hate to be alone. It's the guy from the store. The one from whom you separated? He doesn't have anything. He doesn't have charm, charisma... He isn't attractive... ...he has no sex-appeal. How you know that? Have you laid down with him? Have you? - Yes. - No. It's the truth. It was good. Very good. What every girl dreams of... Tender yet violent... ...viril yet feminine... not hard yet brutal. - Enough! - You see. - Blanche, I want tenderness. - Ask it of your waitress. Shit. Shit! I'm going to fall. I returned to her last night. I climbed on her balcony but, I didn't enter. I only watched. I wanted to tell you. She was alone! That other guy wasn't there. You were right. The profile! I was thinking... ...if I cut my hair? I don't know for sure, I was just thinking about it. Sir, Chateau Margaux "85." It's strange, but it's a blessing. Otro Margaux. - Did he force it upon them? - He's adapted well. Another one? Very well. - Are you OK? - Yes, why? 1 chicken, 2 lobsters & a lamb. - Antoine, lobster. - Good. Come here... Come here... Popeye. Come... Come here... Popeye. You don't look too good. I feel bad. I'm imagining things. If you only knew... I am ashamed, ashamed, so very ashamed. No, no. Don't feel bad, you weren't loved. - You didn't love Christine. - Yes, I know it. But it's not that. Are you sure you don't want me to go & see how she is? Louis, you are a great man. No, you are a great man. - No, no. - Yes, yes. Could you bring me bread, please? Can you... replace me? Don't worry. I'll take the bread. OK. Louis. Louis, Louis. - I'll look for the bread. - OK. You have a rest today. Take a breath. Reflect, perhaps speak to Christine. - You want to go out? - I'm going to the hairdressing salon. I'll go with you. I don't want to be alone. I need a change. - A big change? - Yes. I want to make an impression on an old friend. Is she young... modern? How is she combed for example? I don't know. She uses a scarf. Or, takes a hat. She has tufts that fall on her cheeks... caressing them... - ...going down to her lips. - How does she dress? She dresses pretty but, sober clothes. Always new. & very feminine, perfect... Sometimes exposing the skin... or a plunging neckline. - I'm going for a walk. - That's right. Go see her. - Let's try something modern. - Very well. - I'm going. - Yes, go. So long. I wanted to tell you... - We don't have to see each other anymore. - Of course. Take this. You left it on my balcony. Sorry... Excuse me, I wanted to ask you something. I wanted to know... excuse me. I wanted to ask you... How do you see me, physically? Good, good. I fear that I'm not attractive anymore. That she will not touch me or that I will not excite her. For that reason I didn't enter her apartment the other day. I was afraid of her reaction. Perhaps I should wait. What do you think? Perhaps. How long? I don't know, one week. Or two. A month maximum. That long? Thanks. - When will you work receiving? - Tomorrow. - Already. - Yes. Tomorrow, bring flowers to her at the shop... ...after noon, ...& invite her to dinner. - Tomorrow? - Yes, after noon. Will I become attractive by then? Tell her how much you love her. Tell her that she saved your life. Show her how your love for her made you another man. A happy man. Louis. Flowers, how nice of you. - Do you cry because of me? - No. I do! - How is the lobster? - Highly recommended, very fresh. Ideally baked, not too dry, smooth & tender. - Perfect, 2 lobster with seasalt. - Very well. Can I offer you a Cotes du Rhone. Good character, brief wood passage, ideal with fish. You will return to work dancing. What do you say? - Do you have a minute? - Not now. - I must tell you something. - Later. Everything is going great. It's the ideal moment. They've separated. Her old boyfriend left her by telephone, I arrived just as they were breaking-up. Was she sad? She collapsed, but, in my arms. This couldn't be a more perfect time. I understand. - I tested her... the position. - What? - I faced her & she wasn't put off by my profile. - That's good. - Excuse me. Are you OK? - Yes. - Are you drunk again? - Silence or I'll smash your face! Where's Antoine? Have you seen Antoine? Behind the plates. Antoine, come, I want you to meet somebody. Blanche, this is the man who saved my life. Antoine, this is the woman of whom I have spoken since we first met. He took care of me & got me this job. It's his fault for all this... You're perfectly right... Champagne? I'll be right back. Introduce yourselves. I suggest fish. Well baked & tender. - Where is she? - I don't know, she left. Can you cover for me? - Are you feeling better? - Yes, thanks. I'd like a cigarette. Where is he? Damn you! My car! Shit, sorry, I was mistaken. - It's nothing, only a scratch. - I'll show you! One doesn't disappear for a whole week ...without calling. - I'm worried. Have you spoken with him? - No. - Was he offended? - No. - Did you make him angry? - No. Perhaps I have. Do you think I've made him angry? I wouldn't know. Excuse me, I was ill. I'm very sorry. Are we OK? I've made a dinner reservation. At the Thailand restaurant. It was not my intention... I did... what I could. Look at this. Everything's in disarray. But, I don't regret what happened. I'm quite proud ...of us. & for that reason, I wanted to thank you. One, reservation for Louis Letoux. Taittinger '95, excellent harvest. Dry in the beginning, but then, a taste like honey. You'll enjoy it. Recommendation of sommelier "Chez Jean"
