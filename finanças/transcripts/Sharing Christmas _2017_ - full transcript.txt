'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in hopes that Saint Nicholas soon would be there. The children were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of sugarplums danced in their heads. And Mama in her kerchief, And I in my cap, had just settled in for a long winter's nap, when out on the lawn, there arose such a clatter. Yes! I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. But I heard him exclaim ere he drove out of sight, "Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!" Take care. Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Good night. Mom? Are you okay? Yeah. It's just... I can't believe that was the last time. Honey, we're only moving out to Long Island. We can always come back and visit. I know. It's just... I never thought it'd be so hard to leave this place. Are you guys sure I can't convince you to stay? We talked about this. Your father and I aren't getting any younger. And you, we couldn't ask for anyone better to take our place here, seriously. Honey, the customers love you, the employees love you. You've always done such a great job keeping the Christmas Eve block party going. That is, assuming you wanna keep the shop going. - Yeah. - Are you kidding me? This store has been in our family for over 40 years. This is practically your life's work. Of course I wanna keep it going. Well, since that's the case, The Christmas Shop... is all yours. I'm gonna miss you guys! We're gonna miss you too, sweetheart. Merry Christmas. No, I'm serious. Look, you never know what you're... - Yeah, okay. - I'm so sorry. - Sorry. Here. - No. - Here, after you. - Please. Yeah, sorry. Hang on. So... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I think we should... Don't you just love Christmas in New York? Someone woke up on the right side of the Christmas tree. Good morning, Toby! Good morning to you too. Someone spiked her eggnog. Guys, this is my first day running The Christmas Shop, and I am going to make it... our best season yet. Okay! So what are we gonna work on first? What do you mean? It's like you said, The Christmas Shop is yours. That means you can change whatever you want. Guys, why would I wanna change anything? People have been coming here for 40 years. Generations have grown up with this place. I think it's perfect just the way it is. What are we gonna do about the big Christmas Eve block party? I mean, your dad always did the decorations, and your mom would always read the crowd a story. Assuming people even come. You know sales are down. Guys, we can handle it. Erika and I have been practically running this place for years anyway. Come on, there's nothing to worry about. Everything's going to be just fine. Yeah, I'll look into that for you. These figures in front of me look promising. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah. Let me call you back. All right, yeah. Helen! - What can I do for you? - In case you haven't heard, there's this thing called "Christmas". That sounds vaguely familiar. You sure? 'Cause I'm not seeing any holiday spirit in here. Well, I know, I know. I just, I've been so, so busy. Yeah, come with me. I wanna show you something. Yeah? Michael. Is this the new development? 50 stories, 90 units, full concierge service, health and fitness spa, three restaurants, and an organic supermarket. Broadway Towers. Think you can handle it? I thought Dunbar was overseeing this. He gave notice this morning. He's going over to Weddington. Rich and Chris are still stuck on this downtown project. I honestly don't have anybody else available. Look, if it's gonna be too much work, I mean, we could outsource... No, no, no, I... I can handle it. - You sure? - Absolutely, yeah, yeah. Great. You don't have plans for Christmas, do you? Of course you don't. The way your office looks, I wouldn't be surprised if you got visited by three ghosts on Christmas Eve. You know. A Christmas Carol. Yeah, I get it. Hey, if you were gonna take some time off, take it now. Find somebody special to celebrate before things get crazy around here. Thank you for shopping The Christmas Shop - and have a merry day. - Thanks. - Hey, Chuck. - So the folks finally retired. Yes, but don't you worry. We are not going anywhere. This is for Parker. I know how much he loves them. I'll see you tomorrow, Stephanie. Is there anything for me? I'm expecting a package. You shipped it here? Yeah. My roommate opens my mail. It's from our landlord. You're running the place one day, and they're already raising the rent? - Actually, they're kicking us out. - Ha ha. Very funny. I'm serious. It's a 30-day notice. It says the trust sold the building, and the buyer isn't renewing any of the leases. Let me see that. She's not kidding. It says our last day's December 31st. Did you get one too? They can't do that, can they? Just kick you guys out like that? Well, we're month-to-month, so as long as they give a 30-day notice, they can technically do whatever they want. This is my daughter's favorite store. She's gonna be heartbroken. Well, what about Patty Cakes? You can get coffee and cupcakes anywhere, but this place, it's one-of-a-kind. Where would you start over with a shop like this? Okay, guys, do me a favor and don't tell my parents, okay? I wanna be the one to call them. Eventually. A toast to my kid brother, improving the city one building at a time. How about we see if I actually pull it off first? Will you look at that? A New York real estate mogul who's actually humble. Dad would be proud. Yeah. I know it's not Christmas yet, but we got you something. Aw, you guys. Well, I didn't get you anything. That's all right. Like she said, it's not Christmas yet. Stop it! - Okay. - This guy. Here you go. Thank you. Hey! Whoa! First edition? - Where'd you find this? - A thrift shop in the Village. Since we couldn't get you what you really needed, it's the next best thing. What is it that I really need? Doesn't it bother you? You work all the time, and you have no social life. Mike, when was the last time that you, you know, took a little time for yourself? I appreciate your concern, I do, but I'm fine, really. I have someone that I want you to meet. - Julia... - We went to Columbia together. She's 33, she's lovely, and she's a lawyer at a midtown firm. Just promise me that you'll e-mail her. I appreciate the gesture. I do, really, but I'm fine. Really. It's the sitter. Excuse me. Come on. Work is going great, you're making decent money. Don't you think it's time to start thinking about settling down, having a kid of your own? And give up being Uncle Mike? Not a chance. Come on, let's eat. - Hello. - Hey. You just caught me. I was about to... - I've seen you before. - I don't think so. At the coffee shop downstairs, right? - Right! Yes, hi! - Hi. Can I help you find something? Well, actually, I'm looking for a Christmas decoration. Not really sure if I'm in the right place though. I think we might have a few left. So are you looking for anything in particular? Well, something small. I haven't had a lot of time to get out this year and find anything. My mother always said the best ornaments were the ones that say something. Well, how about a snowman playing the guitar? - Oh, you like him, huh? - I do. Check it out. Sounds like his guitar is out of tune though. Well, to be fair, it's kinda hard to play when your arms are made of twigs. Touche. This is... this is some place you got here. Yeah, well, take a good look while you can. You going out of business? They sold the building, and they're kicking us out at the end of the month. - Well, that's a shame. - Yeah. Tell that to the Scrooges who are kicking us out. And with business being so slow, we can't really afford to move. Well, maybe I could help. Do you have any experience in Christmas miracles? No, but I do have a little experience in real estate. I'd be happy to give you some advice. I mean, if you want. - Some advice? - Yeah, well... assuming that you've been a good tenant, which I'm sure that you have, I think they could get you at least a relocation cost. Interesting. Of course, you could always just fight it. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna look at a few things, and I'll give you a call tomorrow. If you want. Stephanie Nichol. It's really nice to meet you, Stephanie. I'm Michael. I'm gonna take this little guy 'cause he's got soul. Great choice. Is that in dollars? And two eyes made out of coal. What are you working on? I'm just looking something up for a friend. Take a walk with me. - Morning! - Good morning, Erika. Late night? I was looking for spaces for rent. - And? - I don't suppose you have any rich uncles I don't know about. I gotta tell you, my mom is not gonna be happy with me moving back in with her. We have 30 days to figure this out. - We can do this. We can. - Yeah. I know you're the optimistic one. That's what everyone likes about you. But it's not like someone's just gonna walk in the door and tell us how to save the store. - Well... - Did someone walk in the door and tell you how to save the store? All he said was that he was in real estate, and he might be able to help. But it might be nothing. Nothing? Stephanie, think about it. The day you find out you're getting evicted, someone just happens to show up and offers you a way out. It's like a fairy tale. Okay, what if I am not looking for my Prince Charming right now? When are you gonna learn there's more to life than just eating frozen pizza at home alone? And what if I like frozen pizza? All I'm saying is open your mind. Sometimes change is good. What are we doing here? You are so terrible at surprises. You must've been a real pistol at Christmastime. I give you Broadway Towers. Wait, you bought this building? Trolley Square? Isn't it great? The location is perfect. I mean, it's near the subway. Park's two blocks that way. What about the tenants? Well, you don't have to worry about them. They'll be out by the end of the month. It's him. Prince Charming? So if everybody gets out by the 31st, I mean, we can break ground the first of January. - Michael! - Hi, Stephanie. Break ground for what? A state-of-the-art residential complex and shopping center. And you are? Stephanie Nichol. Helen. Do you two know... Michael, are you okay? You look sick. Michael, I don't understand. I'm the Scrooge that's kicking you out. A little experience in real estate? - I told you, I didn't know. - And you just wander in. I was looking for Christmas decorations. I'm such an idiot. Nobody's saying that you have to close the store forever. There's plenty of opportunities in the city for places like this. You think I didn't look? Without rent control, we don't have a lot of options. Well, maybe I can help you find something. You know what? Why do I have to move? Why don't you find a new place? You said yourself there's plenty of opportunities in the city. Stephanie, this is a billion-dollar development. They're not just gonna pick up and move because... Why? Because of a little shop like this? Last night, you told me I should fight. That was before. Before you knew it was you. Yeah. Best I can do, I can talk to my boss about this, but I'm not making any promises. Okay, well, I won't hold my breath. Let's get back to work. I can be back in the office in 30 minutes. Hey, guys. How's the new place? So far so good. We're still unpacking. Your father is a pack rat. Hey, I'm standing right here. So how's everything with the shop? The shop is, great. You actually brought this? It's my favorite hat. I'll buy you a new one. You sound stressed out. Mom, everything's fine. Are you eating okay? I could have Patty bring you some of her rugelach. It's just been a busy day, that's all. You're sure there's nothing I can do? Mom, everything is okay. I'll call you later, okay? Sure. Love you, sweetheart. - Here you go. - Thank you. Stephanie! Hey, Amelia. Are you going to take my order today? In that case, I will have the usual. Coming right up. Thank you. - Hey, what did she say? - The usual. I'll get that. Don't you have eviction notices to be serving up or something? I'll tell you what. I have a table over there with an empty chair. Now if you wanna take a moment and chat, it's yours. If not, it's really nice to see you again, and I hope to see you around, okay? Yep. It's the good-looking ones you have to worry about. Yeah, right? - Talk to him. - What? You know what they say. Yeah, that no good deed goes unpunished? Keep your enemies closer. Bah humbug. Gingerbread muffin? I thought Christmas wasn't your thing. I don't have anything against Christmas. I'm just busy. I really wanna help you. This place will have to close too, you know. And the flower shop across the way. Did you know the Blooms invested their entire life savings into that place? Wait. Their last name is actually Bloom? Stephanie, look around. It's dead here. I suppose you and your boss want to turn it into a juice bar or a yoga studio. You're taking this personally. It is personal. My parents worked so hard for that place. 40 years. I'm sure that they'll understand that it's not your fault. Says a guy who's probably never had to worry about anything a day in his life. You think I just woke up one day and decided I wanted to do this? That's just the sad part. Maybe it is just a job for you. But I've spent practically my entire life in that shop, and if you just spent a little time there, you would see how special it was too. I don't need to hang out in your shop to see how much it means to you. No, but maybe you'd find it means something to you. I'm gonna need you down there on site anyway, meeting with the architects, contractors, inspectors. You know, and if your being there makes her feel more comfortable about this transition, then what's the harm? Because I feel bad. She already told me that the store can't afford to move. I can't be concerned with the well-being of every tenant. I know. All I'm saying is that with everything going on, it might just be easier if you were down there on site. I'll think about it, okay? Don't forget your snowman. We wouldn't want him to get lonely now, would we? Don't look now, but your Prince Charming is back. Michael. What are you doing here? Well, someone told me if I spent a little time here, I'd see how special this place really is. Luckily for me, I have to spend a lot of time here getting this project off the ground. Well, in that case, welcome to The Christmas Shop. You set this all up yourself? It's a work in progress. And in this corner, we have our very own North Pole. Does he sing too? Funny. And then right over here is our holiday row. This is where we keep all of our themed ornaments. We have a Fourth of July tree, a Halloween tree. - An Easter tree? - We're a year-round store. You should've seen our haunted house in October. I can imagine. Block party, huh? The biggest and best holiday block party in our neighborhood. We do it every Christmas Eve, right here behind the building. Cute. I never would've imagined that there was enough Christmas stuff to, you know. Fill an entire store? Anything and everything you need for the holiday spirit. That's what my mom used to say. I'm curious about one thing. Why didn't your parents ever decide to modernize? What do you mean? Well, I'm not saying that you have to change everything. It's just, you know, little updates here and there. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Stephanie, your register's ancient, you have handwritten price tags, and you got a staff of, what, two? How do you even process online orders? Do you even have a website? - Seriously? - Everybody's got a website. The Christmas Shop is meant to be an experience. When you walk in here, it's not just another shop. It's the lights and the music and the... Animated Santa Claus. Okay, turn around and close your eyes. Right now? I won't bite. All right, now what? Take a deep breath. Smell that? I, uh... Oh, wait. Is that pine? Cinnamon. Is that apple? It's Christmas. I, yeah... I have a contractor's meeting in five minutes downstairs, - so... - Okay. I'm gonna go to work. - Thank you. - Of course, yeah. Yeah, she's old-fashioned. She just likes nostalgia. There's nothing wrong with that. You have to admit, your parents were a little old school. Isn't that part of the appeal? Why does everything have to change? You like her. No, it's just business, man. I don't actually work at the store. I just have a lot of on-site meetings, you know? Seeing him with those inspectors and everything, it was like he couldn't wait to tear the place down. He's just doing his job. Maybe if he wasn't trying to destroy everything my parents worked so hard for, I would think about it. So you're telling me that if all things were equal, you still wouldn't go out with her? What's it matter? At the end of the month, it'll be closed, and Helen will have her big new skyscraper. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know. I'm not really looking for someone in my life right now. I meant the store. Oh, right. You still have that reporter friend over at the Sentinel. I have an idea. Michael, could you... Oh, sure. - Thanks. - Of course. I got you, bro. Here you go. All right, have a good one. Thanks. - Bye. Thanks for coming. - Bye. Thanks. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That is not how we say that. - Say what? - Repeat after me. Thank you for shopping at The Christmas Shop. Have a merry day. Come on, just try it. Thank you for shopping at The Christmas Shop! Thank you for shopping at The Christmas Shop. - Have a merry day. - Have a merry day. That's sort of what you're going for, right? Somewhere in there? You hate it. Yeah.. Watch a master at work. Welcome to The Christmas Shop. How may I help you? I am Allie Hadley with the New York Sentinel, and I am looking for Stephanie, regarding a potential article about The Christmas Shop. - Yes, I'm Stephanie. - Hi. You were not kidding. This place is really cute. You said you work for the Sentinel? Yeah, hi, Allie. You work here too? Interesting story about that. Michael Kilpatrick. I work for MacLaine Properties. You guys don't mind if I record this, right? How about that one right there? It's called The Christmas Shop. Yeah! All in different colors. Really pick whatever you want. Thanks. What is going on? The Sentinel printed a story about the shop on the front of their Life section. Thank you for shopping at The Christmas Shop. Have a merry day! Get a load of this! Isn't it incredible? Actually, it's a Christmas miracle. It seems like the Upper West Side might get coal in their proverbial stocking this year, in yet another example of a well-connected developer forcing out a quaint mom-and-pop shop. I'm just trying to enhance the neighborhood. I don't need this kind of publicity. I warned you. This Christmas Shop is really important to Stephanie. She's not going down without a fight. Clearly. Maybe there's something that we can do to let her stay. It's just one store. If we don't break ground on schedule, the financiers lose their patience. And if the financiers lose their patience, the entire deal falls apart. So no, Michael, I'm sorry. The Polar Express has left the station. People have been coming from all over the city to finally experience that holiday magic. The shop is now run by Stephanie Nichol, whose parents started the business about 40 years ago. Just because something's been around for a while, doesn't mean it needs to be replaced. And it's so important to me that the people of this neighborhood and this city have a place that they can go to where they feel Christmas spirit in their hearts. That's not bad, huh? While no one can say how long it'll be here, The Christmas Shop is a memorable experience for anyone who takes the time to visit. - Hey, Mom. - Ellen Peterson called to say that she heard from Susan Larson that Lilian Bland said that they sold the building? Mom, I am so sorry. I just didn't wanna worry you. Well, of course I'm gonna worry. I'm your mother. You're my responsibility. I'll figure something out somehow. Is this even food? Why can't I order the bacon? Remember your last checkup? Dr. Stein said you have to watch your cholesterol. You should see the attention the shop has got since the story went viral. If I could just change his mind. Whose mind? It's, it's not important. Steph, what have you gotten yourself into? Just let me call you in a few days. Everything is gonna be just fine. Okay, sweetheart. I love you. Bye. Daniel Martin Nichol! You put that back right this second! We brought cupcakes! Cinnamon swirl! You didn't have to do that. Speak for yourself. Mommy, can I go see the reindeer? Sure. All the press your store has gotten - has been great for business. - Really? You don't think it might turn things around, do you? I don't know. But I wanted to tell you, we found a new location. Really? Over on 84th. It's smaller, but it's got a great kitchen. We were planning to move after the block party. The Blooms found a place too. What about you guys? - Well... - Stephanie... you're not actually trying to fight them, are you? No, no, of course not, I... I better get going. I didn't think you had any meetings today. I saw you on TV this morning. Well, I just wanted people to appreciate a good old-fashioned Christmas. I thought you were terrific. Really? You made me wanna run out and buy an ornament right now. Well, what's stopping you? Look, since you're already here, and you don't have any meetings, do you wanna lend a hand? Why not? Patty came by this morning. Said she found a place. The Blooms too. Really? You didn't know? Actually, I didn't. But it must make you happy, right? I mean, you're winning. Stephanie, this is not a game. It's not about winning or losing. It's just progress. Did it ever occur to you that maybe things are a certain way for a reason? That tradition is something to be preserved? Tradition? What are you doing tomorrow night? Why? Well, I was wondering if... maybe you would wanna go someplace with me. You mean, like a date? No, no, definitely, definitely not a date. So, where are we gonna be going exactly on this not-date? It's a surprise. Well, at least tell me what time I can pick you up. You're going to pick me up, are you? Yeah. Tradition. Okay. Then this is my address. - I'll see you at seven. - Okay. Excuse me, could you help me find something for my little girl? Yeah, don't worry. I got this covered. Okay. Right over here. It's not a date. It's just a... you know. Business meeting? She's determined to make me fall in love with Christmas. Do you ever ask yourself why he agreed to be there at the shop? Maybe he felt bad. Or maybe he just wanted to give the place a shot. I actually think that she does have something special there. So what's the problem then? You and I both know what this is really about. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're the one complaining about the women you date. And for good reason. Michael is different. He can actually be pretty helpful... when he wants to be. You should've seen her on television. Yeah, this is just a business meeting, all right. Sure. Come on. Let's hit the ice. - Let me show you who's boss. - You are so going down! Not a date, not a date, not a date. You look... So do you. I mean, hi. Sorry. Please come in. This is some place you got. What do you get per square foot around here? Sorry, I can't turn it off. I was subletting from a friend of mine, and then I just kinda took it over. It's so close to the shop. That's great. One of the many benefits. Are those... Yeah, yeah, these are for you. They're beautiful, thank you. I'll go find something to put them in. Sounds good. So any clue as to where we're going tonight? And ruin the surprise? Hey, I think I know your cousin. There we go. You ready? Lead the way. It's just up ahead, I promise. Okay, I'm excited. We're here. What? What is this? You'll see. After you. You sure we wouldn't be more comfortable in the back? Relax. - You are gonna love this. - Okay. Dave Koz? I thought you'd appreciate it. Stephanie. You know the story about this song? No, tell me. Well, originally it was in German. It's called "O Tannenbaum," and it wasn't Christmassy at all. It was just a story about a fir tree, and the fir tree symbolized faithfulness. Later, once the tradition of the Christmas tree got started, which was the late 1800s, that's when they added some more lyrics and turned it into the Christmas carol that we know and love today. I didn't know that. That was amazing. How did you know he was gonna perform? Stephanie! Merry Christmas. It's great to see you. Dave, there's someone I want you to meet. Dave, meet Michael. Michael, meet Dave. - Michael, nice to meet you. - Yeah, great to meet you too. - Did you enjoy the show? - It was fantastic, yeah. - It was really fun. - Great. I'm so happy that you could come. And by the way, you were so right about the poinsettias. Look how great they look on our set. - Always happy to help. - I really appreciate it. Listen, I gotta run. Great to see you. All the best. Great to meet you, Michael. - Yeah, a real pleasure. - I appreciate you guys coming. - Thank you. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Bye. Okay, so how do you know him? - Who, Dave? - Yeah. He's been coming to our shop for years. Well, when he's actually in town. Okay, yeah. Dave Koz shops at your store. A lot of people do. Like I told you, our shop is special. So you're really into music, huh? Actually, once upon a time, I wanted to be a music teacher. Well, I was a music teacher briefly. - Really? - Yeah. PS 238 in the Bronx. - What happened? - Budget cuts. Apparently music appreciation wasn't viewed as a necessity. That's such a shame. Luckily I had a fallback. My dad was really into real estate for a long time, so it just kinda came naturally to me. Really? Yeah, while all his friends were saving up for college, he bought his first building. It was a rundown duplex in Springfield, Ohio. Wait, you're from Ohio? Richland County, born and raised. I would've thought you were more of a... Big city guy? Not a chance. Well, I've lived here my whole life. Yeah, you strike me as the kinda gal who likes to stay put. So do you ever work with him? My dad? He, he offered, you know. I think he always wanted me to follow in his footsteps, but I just wanted to make it on my own, you know? Do my own thing. Now it's my turn to show you something cool. Come on. Who is that? This is one of my favorite places in the city. Michael K. What's up, Randy? I want you to meet... - Christmas girl. - Randy. You're not the only one who likes records, you know. That record you ordered came in. - I'm gonna grab it for you. - All right. So let me get this straight. You know Dave Koz and Randy. Well, when my parents downsized their apartment, I pretty much inherited their entire collection. You could say that's when I fell in love. I always felt that music had the potential to be honest and pure. It's not just about tempo and melody. It's about the joy that it brings people. Culture. The traditions? Exactly. - Here you go. - Thanks. Wait, a Christmas album? Well, okay, first off, this is not just a Christmas album. This is the Christmas album. Recorded by the Good Knights. - You know it? - Know it? My grandmother used to play this for us every year. I haven't heard this album in years. You should have it. Wait, what? Yeah, no, I want you to have it. No, Michael, I couldn't. Trust me, if anybody deserves it, it's you. Thank you. You're welcome. I know Randy's store is not for everyone, but for those who love it, it's special. My family's shop isn't much different, you know. You know Randy used to be downtown? One day the building that he was in decided they could make more money with a big box store. Randy had to move. I didn't know that. That space that we were in? I helped him find it. All you have to do is ask. Well, thank you for a wonderful evening. Will you be okay getting home? I just have to pick something else up on the way home. Well, good night. Good night, Stephanie. Enjoy your record. Okay, Michael. If you can help Randy... Does that look crooked to you? Who asked you anyway? Michael? What are you doing? Updating your software. And what's wrong with the old software? Nothing. I love a good abacus. - I mean, who doesn't, right? - Funny. See, but with this program, it uses your WiFi to connect your scanners, keeping track of your inventory instantaneously. Speaking of which, did you know that you're down to your last two sugarplum music boxes? Tradition doesn't have to be outdated, Stephanie. Come on. Excuse me, do you have any cookie cutters? - We sure do, they're... - Allow me. I got this. Right this way. Got everything you could possibly ever dream of. We've got Santa Clauses, snowflakes, Christmas trees. You're glowing! I am not. And he certainly seems to be in a good mood. He does, doesn't he? Hey, I was wondering if you could watch the shop. I just have an appointment. Everything okay? Yeah, just a little something I have to take care of. - Sure, whatever you need. - Take this one? That feels right. Excellent choice. Christmas tree, okay. So scan the item, and it deducts it from your inventory instantly. Thank you. That'll be $5.50. Here you go. Thank you. Thank you for shopping at The Christmas Shop. Have a merry day. Okay, you are getting pretty good at that. Don't you have work to do? Hey, what are you doing Friday night? I... My brother has this Christmas party every year, and I was wondering, maybe if you're not busy, you'd like to come as my date. Date? We don't have to stay the whole time if you don't want to. It's usually just his co-workers, which are just a bunch of boring computer people. You make it sound so enticing. Well, they have Jenga, so that's a win. I would love to, I really would, but I have to set up for the holiday block party. But if you find yourself getting tired of your brother's co-workers... I'd love to. I mean, if you would like me to help, I could come lend a hand. Of course. There she is! Mr. Cranston! Good to see you. So how are the parents enjoying retirement? They're great. Well, they're lucky to have you look after the place. Thank you. So what do you have for us this year? I know it's in good hands. I will let you know when it's done. All right. Looking forward to it. Bye, bye. Is that a message from Santa? Mr. Cranston is one of our oldest and dearest customers. About 35 years ago, he had an idea for an ornament he wanted made. He brought the idea to my father, and he created him something. Ever since, he's been coming here every year with a new subject, something to share with his wife. And you make him an ornament. It could be a moment, a memory, a milestone. One year, it was the birth of their son. Another, it was a special vacation they took. What was the subject this year? Their first date. What are we gonna make? I don't know. - Something urgent? - It won't take long. - Erika? - Go. We got this. - Don't we? - Absolutely. Thanks. 686 square feet. The building's just been renovated. There is tremendous foot traffic here. Great visibility. It's very nice. So what is it you say you do? Retail. Our family... Well, I own a Christmas shop on the Upper West Side. I think I saw that on the news. Didn't Helen MacLaine buy that building? Yep, that's the one. I'm curious, what is it your store does for the rest of the year? What do you mean? Well, when it's not Christmastime. Well, we sell decorations for other holidays as well. St. Patrick's Day, Valentine's Day, Easter. Ms. Nichol. I'm going to be very honest with you. The people that own this property, they were looking for something with a little more ongoing potential, like a juice bar or a yoga studio. Right. Of course. You never know until you try, right? I, I do have a property in Jersey City. That might be a little more up your alley. Yeah. I'll think about it. Hello? It's me. Hey, your father and I are in the middle of a game. He thinks Kringle is a real word. It is a real word! What's going on? I don't think I can do it. Do what, sweetheart? Save the shop. I tried, Mom, I really did. The shop just doesn't make enough money to qualify for a new lease. Oh, honey. I know how important the shop is to you and Dad, but it just, it just seems like everything's changing. And I'm trying so hard to hold onto it, to preserve something that means so much to so many people. Well, you did the best you could. Then why do I feel like I'm letting you down? Not just you and Dad, but Erika and Toby and all the customers. Honey, you didn't let us down. We don't need the shop to be happy. We have each other. That's what's important. That's all we've ever needed. And you know what? We'll make new traditions. Erika and Toby will be fine. The customers will be fine. And your father and I will always be proud of you, no matter what, okay? Now Christmas is in four days. You make it the best four days that shop has ever seen, okay? Okay. You got it. Well? It isn't here, but I gave you "frankincense". Frankincense is a word. Dan. What are we doing here? Playing a game. No, I mean here. - I mean, don't you feel... - Bored? I miss the city. We don't belong here. We belong there, with our daughter. Well, then let's go home. Really? Yeah. I love you! Does this mean I can order bacon again? - No. - No? All right, well, yeah, let's get those over to the office, all right? - Okay, thank you. - Yes, sir. Helen, what are you doing here? Everything proceeding on schedule? Yeah, don't worry. They'll be out on time if that's what you're concerned about. Is that what you think? They're good people. I'm sure they are. Michael, I realize that I put a lot of responsibility on your shoulders, but I haven't heard from you in three days, so I wanted to come down here and see how you were doing. Look, the permits have been submitted and approved. They think that they can preserve some of the facade as a focal point, if you're still interested. I wanted to come down to see how you were doing. Excuse me, can you help me find something? Of course, yeah. Excuse me. So are you looking for something for your parents? No, my teacher. What grade are you in? Third grade, but we're leaving. My family and I are moving to Seattle. Seattle's a nice place. I don't wanna move. You know, when I was about your age, I had to move too. To Seattle? No, it was to Ohio. My dad got a job there, so we had to pack up everything that we owned and put it into these boxes and get it all onto a great big truck. My mom let me pack my own toys. Yeah? Well, you know what happened after that? I met my best friend Jack. Yeah. We went everywhere together. He was the best. We went to the movies, we went to the library. He even taught my brother and I how to play hockey. - So guess what happened next? - What? I wasn't sad anymore. In fact, it turned out to be one of the best things that ever happened to me. I don't want Ms. Hill to forget me. - Is that your teacher? - Yeah. Do you have like... Do you have like a favorite memory from your class? Last week she read us a book about a gingerbread family. Yeah? Come with me. I got the perfect thing for you. What do you think? It's just like the one in the book! Well, then I'm sure she'll love it. How much? Tell you what. If you give Seattle a fair shot, it's on me, okay? - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Your boss left. That's too bad. So that was very sweet. Well, you know, somebody once told me that the best ornaments are the ones that say things. Sounds like someone very wise. And special. - Speaking of ornaments... - Yes? I believe that we have a first date ornament to make. We do, do we? Come on, open this letter up. Let's see what it says. I remember the very first date Mary and I ever had. I was working as a fry cook in a little diner in San Francisco. One late December night, I'm in the back. Someone's crooning "Jingle Bells" on the jukebox. And that's when Mary walked in. Her eyes sparkled like ice crystals on fresh fallen snow. Her smile lit up the whole room. We must've talked for hours. And then I asked her to dance. Right there in the middle of that greasy diner. And I knew I would be dancing with this woman for the rest of my life. I got it. Do you wanna help? I'm not really the artistic type. Come on, this is your idea. Grab me a brush. Tiny one. Other one. Bingo. Okay, here. Okay, now dip lightly. Okay. And then make a circle right in the middle. All right, not bad. You know, I think this could use some glitter. And you said you weren't the artistic type. When in Rome... - Right there. - Yeah? - Yep. - Here? Gold or silver? What are you thinking? That one. And then sprinkle it lightly. No, I said lightly! That was lightly. Beautiful. It is a beautiful night, isn't it? - I mean you. - Me? Yeah, I had no idea how talented you were. Thank you, but I've never really thought of myself as talented. Well, here we are. After you. Oh, my goodness, look at that! That's just beautiful. Oh, yes. That's me, and that's you, honey. Stephanie, this is perfect, as always. It was Michael's idea. And it comes with this. Hon, look! They've even got the record. This will look great on the tree with the other ornaments you've given us. And to think all I was trying to do that night was get in out of the rain. And I was just trying to finish up those dishes so I could go home. And now we've got all these memories. Stephanie, that's a very special shop you got there. Take good care of it. Honey, this is beautiful. The shop made all these? They're beautiful. And every one is personal. Do all of your customers have a collection like Mr. Cranston? - Quite a few. Why? - I was just thinking. Where are they gonna go if your shop closes down? Well, tell that to Helen MacLaine. You know what? I think I will. Wait, really? Yeah. I'm not gonna let her close the shop. I... - We should... - Definitely. Yeah, I think... I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow too. Yeah. Have a good night. Yes! Michael. We have to talk. This Christmas Shop is unique and a special place. It means so much to the people in that community. I know it's old-fashioned, but you know what? That's okay. Because if you want hip and urban, there is a whole city out there for you. But if you want someplace that's sweet and magical, then shouldn't there be someplace you can go? What are you suggesting? Let 'em stay. We talked about this. You transfer the lease to the new building, give 'em the same terms. They're paying 75% below market value. They've been there for 40 years! I can appreciate tradition. This company goes back five generations. I mean, my great great grandfather worked along Reginald Vanderbilt himself. Our investors expect a return. A return is based on anticipated revenue. What kind of revenue can I promise when I'm giving my tenants a discount? I'm not talking about all of them. I'm just talking about that one. We have full occupancy at this point, and I've got over a hundred names on the wait list. Please. I'm sorry, Michael, I can't. I can't. Then consider this my resignation. Michael... If you're gonna kick 'em out, I'm not gonna be a part of it. Stephanie. You weren't kidding. - Michael! - Stephanie. - Hi! - Hi. We have to talk. Is there a place that we can go? - Okay. - Yeah? So... how did it go? It's over. What? Stephanie, I am so sorry. There's just nothing that I can do. I don't understand. You've seen how important this place is to everyone. Helen's hands are tied. The building's already full. It hasn't even been built yet. I know. Maybe, maybe you can just talk to her again. - I can't. - Why not? - Because I quit. - What? I couldn't be a part of doing this to you. - Michael... - I'm so sorry. I feel like I'm letting everybody down. I just... I wanted to give you your Christmas miracle. I know. I appreciate everything that you've done. I guess we just ran out of time, that's all. Yeah. With everything that's going on, I think I need some alone time. Yeah, I understand. Okay. If you need anything... Leasing opportunity. Lease? Hey, it's me. Yeah, you got that paperwork on the Broadway Towers project? How far back does it go? All right, there you go, man. Don't tell your mom how much money you spent, all right? Hey, are these all the snowmen you have? Look at you! Mom, Dad? - Sweetheart! - There's my girl. Hi, sweetie. I don't understand. What are you doing here? Well, we had a chat after you called the other day and... The city's our home. We belong here with you. Even if it is a little packed. And the taxis are a little loud. Looks like you're stuck with us, honey. Guys, I am so sorry. You left me in charge, and I really let you down. I just really thought Michael would be able to help. - Sounds like he really tried. - I suppose you're right. I guess it doesn't matter anymore 'cause next year everyone's gonna go to some big box store for their Christmas decorations. But every once in a while someone will remember that little shop on the corner, where they felt magical. Used to. You know honey, whether you want them to or not, things change. Sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. How you adapt to that change is all up to you? It's Christmas Eve. Do you really wanna spend the holiday moping? Or are we gonna think about things we can really celebrate? Now go out there and make us proud. He had a broad face and a little round belly that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly. He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself. A wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread. Aw, thanks! He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, and filled all the stockings and then turned with a jerk. Oh, no, thank you. Could you tell me where to find Stephanie Nichol? Thank you. But I heard him exclaim ere he drove out of sight, "Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!" What are you doing here? You didn't think I was gonna miss the biggest and the best holiday party on the Upper West Side, did you? You were wonderful. Thank you. Not bad. Helen! I didn't expect to see you here. Michael called me this afternoon and asked me to come down. What's up? Well, last night, on a whim, I decided to take a look at the paperwork from the acquisition of the building. I found this. Michael, I've had several attorneys review the transfer from the property's trust. I assure you there are no issues. Maybe not with the trust, but this is the original lease from The Christmas Shop. Mr. Nichol, perhaps you remember this. That's my old lease. 40 years ago, when your dad opened the store, the building was owned by his friend. Ben. Yeah, but he passed away a long time ago. He must've liked you a lot because he put a very interesting clause in there. 5B, if you care to read. Basically it says that, in the event that the building is sold, either by him or his heir... "The Christmas Shop has the option to purchase the building". We do? He's not kidding. "In the event that the building is sold, the lessor will be given first option to purchase the building at fair market value". But, Michael, at fair market value, there's no way we'd be able to afford it. I know. That's why you need an investor. Who's that? My father. Hey, son. You must be Stephanie. Michael spoke very highly of you when he called me last night. Michael... Michael called you? Yes, yes. And is the store inside? Yes. Would you like to see it? I'd be delighted. Please. Very whimsical. This is adorable. Smells like Christmas. You know, when my son called me last night and told me about this store, I knew it had to be something special. Now, standing here... I knew he was right. Thank you so much, Mr. Kilpatrick. Please, call me Thomas. And I should be the one thanking you. For what? For giving me something I've wanted for a very long time. Finally something we can do together. Deep down I think I always knew you weren't happy. But now I can see you found a place where you belong, and I want nothing more but to be a part of that. Yes. I would be proud to invest in such a delightful venture. Who are these lovely people over here? This is my mom, and this is my dad. - How are you, sir? - This is Mr. Kilpatrick. Such a lovely daughter you have, and what a beautiful store. I'm sorry about your development, Helen, but Mr. Nichol had a deal. How are you? It's only a building. Our investors will find other deals. As for you, I knew your heart wasn't in real estate. I'm just glad that you found what truly makes you happy. Thank you. You gotta promise me something. Anything. Take good care of her. She's a keeper. I intend to. Merry Christmas. I invited Dave and his family over to join me for Christmas dinner tomorrow. I'd very much like it if the two of you would join. - It's a date. - Very well then. I'll look forward to seeing you both tomorrow. Merry Christmas, Dad. Merry Christmas, son. Of course, if you have other plans... I wouldn't miss it for the world. I know what it meant for you to call your dad, so thank you... for everything. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Got it. Well, thank you for shopping at The Christmas Shop. Have a merry day. Hey, we got a phone order for two musical wreaths. Got it. Honey, how can I tell which orders have been processed? I think they're the ones in that column. We got two more orders. You know what? I can handle this. You take care of the computer. - Well, we did it! - We sure did. And if things keep up like this, we'll be able to pay your dad back for that down payment in... next month. And, you know what? I still think that this is a pretty special place. It is, isn't it? Thank you. Now... let's talk about franchising. No. Come on, we can have a Christmas Shop in New York, Chicago, LA, San Diego, San Francisco.
