It's made my life hell. Mom. Mom. Turn off that alarm. Appu. Appu. Look, its dawn already. Get up, child. It's the first day of school today. At least be on time. I know from tomorrow you'll be going on your own sweet time. Get up, dear. My doll. My child. My sweety. My angel. Damn you! Get up, Appu. Or I'll slap you. Appu. Get up. Appu. Don't go without freshening up? Take a bath and pray before you leave. Only God can save you this time. Your lunch-box's is in the bag. Don't forget to pack it. What did you make? Eggplant. Eggplant, on the first day? You could've made potatoes. Vacations are over, and now this. If your wishes came true, you'd stay at home all year... and eat potatoes? Whore! Keep this. 10 rupees? I am a grown-up now. No. You've become lazy. Keep this too. Why did you name me Apeksha? Why did I name you Apeksha? Meaning? It starts with an A. So my name comes first during roll call. Couldn't you think of a name with Z. That would've given me another 10 minutes. So change your name. Call yourself 'Zandu Balm'. Go carefully. And wake up. Sazia. Appu's awake, but I don't trust her. Please check on her once. Today it's the first day of the new class. O Lord... Goddess Sheravali... Sai Baba... Appu's in class 10 this year. Please save her. Please. Save me from maths. Good morning, ma'am. You're here. You're never late. Oh ho... -Boil water for tea. -Yes. Sweety, how were the holidays? Amazing. Look at him staring at us. Over-smart principal. Where is Pintu? I don't know. He must be coming. Hello, ladies. Welcome back. Did your daughter, Appu, go to school, I hope so. Who'd know if she's gone somewhere else. She's a big pain, this girl, a big pain. I wonder what she'll do in future. I am getting grey hair worrying about her. I just noticed this morning. Here and here. Really? What do I make for you? I want to eat paratha today. You know, I've decided. I'll learn some English. Later, I'll move to Mumbai and drive a taxi. Why learn English if you want to drive a taxi? Not the common ones. The one with AC! Only rich people use that to commute. And one more thing. You also get a uniform to wear, along with a cap. -Yes. -Come on. And, Sweety, what about you? What about her. -She'll get married in 3 - 4 years. -Yes. And until then, she has her daily soaps to keep her company. What's the principal doing here? He teaches maths to class 10. Oh no... as if maths wasn't enough, and now him? Double headache. Look. Look at him. Bloody smarty pants. He's all charged up. Children, finally you've managed... to get to class 10. And just like, one can predict. what a kid will grow up to be. Similarly, your class 10 results determine who is a winner, and who is... Loser. Children, this year, every hour... every minute, every second is priceless for all of you. -Those who use it wisely, will be the... -Winner. -And those who waste it... -Loser. So, children, what do you want to be? Winner. Say it loud. Winner. Winner. Winner. Winner. Winner. Winner. Winner. Winner. Very good. Now maths. Little island. What is...? Huh? You should never make pickles by the recipes given in books. Why not? My grandma used to say... How was your first day? Same class, same books. Same class, same books? Didn't they promote you to class 10? Of course, I was promoted to class 10. 9th or 10th, what difference does it make? Just the books get a little thicker. Yeah, but you must have new teachers? Yes. We have.. Ranbir Kapoor for Maths. And Salman Khan for Physics. Pintu's really lucky. Soon he'll become a driver, like his father. Yeah! What a great achievement! What will you do? Did you ever give it any thought? Mom, once you start, you don't to stop. Then the cost of one sweet was twenty-five paisa. Ma'am, buttermilk. -Fifty paise for two. -The inflation too is high! Wow! Oh ho... What happened? Stop sticking your nose in the glass. Brother, pack 250 grams of jalebi! -Ma'am, I want to ask you something. -What? Studying Medical and Engineering... must be really expensive, right? Not when I used to study. That's how I became a doctor. But now... education has become more of a business. It costs somewhere around 500,000 to 1 million. At some places, the fee is between 2 to 5 million. That was really fun! Who gave the sweet? From Uncle Mansoor's house. His son got a job. As a peon. They are also throwing a party tomorrow. Who celebrates for a peon's job? Stupid people. Oh mom, Government job, 8000 salary. Think about it. 8000 rupees! Government job. Uncle Mansoor's really lucky. Appu. Appu. Hmm? What do you want to be? Tell me, dear... you must have thought something. What's to think? Tell me. I will be a maid. What? What? What will you he? Maid? A engineer's son becomes an engineer... and a doctor's son, becomes a doctor. What else can a maid's daughter be? Maid. It's that simple. I'll give you a tight slap. Is this why I've been slogging around? Am I sending you to school so that you can be a maid? Do you know what it means to be a maid? Listen carefully, Appu, and remember. No matter what happens, you won't become a maid. Did you get that? Did I say something wrong? Do you want one? Mother. Mom! It's not that maids don't have a future. These rich people, need a maid... to look after their kids. And... they call them maid. They are called Nanny. Nanny or granny! If you say that you want to be a maid, I'll slap you silly. You can't do a single chore around the house... and dream to be a maid. The children in this country... have no freedom to decide their career. Come. Give it here. What's wrong? Couldn't sleep last night? What do I say? I am totally confused. Maybe I can help. Tell me. Appu wants to be a maid. Maid? Why? Because I am one. That isn't right. Isn't it. I said the same thing. Some logic about engineer's son becomes a engineer... so, a maid's daughter will be a maid. Then Abdul Kalam should've been a fisherman. Because his father was a fisherman. Then what did be become? Stop eating your hair. First be became a renowned scientist. Later... India's President. Means... Rahstrapati She knows that. Who? The one with the long hair. Now I remember. In 'Tere Naam', even Salman Khan had the same hairstyle The movie was a big success. All the boys in my neighbourhood copied his hairstyle. But not my husband. He didn't have such habits. But, his daughter is very fashionable. Chanda, people find success through two things. Luck or hard work. That's true. And if poor people were lucky... they wouldn't be poor, right? True. So what's left is hard work. That's what she'll have to do. That's the problem, sister. Appu doesn't want to do hard work. She never listens. She's all grown-up now, but stubborn as hell. If this continues, I don't she'll even clear her class 10 exams. No, Chanda. She will have to clear her class 10 at any cost. Let me warn you. If she fails in 10th, she will stop studying. I've seen many such kids. You were one of them too. Take this off, and take those. Keep this one outside too. I was thinking about what you said... about your daughter yesterday. Why do you think she won't pass her exams? Some learning disability... Mrs. Deewan, You didn't show up yesterday. I wasn't in the mood. Does she have dyslexia or something... What? What film was that... Yes, 'Taare Zameen Par'. No, ma'am. She's not stupid. In fact she's over smart. Always interested in other things Happening around her. And she scores decent marks in other subjects. Well, at least she passes. Just this maths. That's what troubles her. Oh... Girls have an old enmity with maths. If only we can solve this problem... I think she should take coaching in maths. Don't worry about money. I know Mr. Gupta. He runs a coaching classes. I will talk to him. Will you talk to him? We should also check for dyslexia. I doubt... Ma'am, she's got none of those. She's just stubborn, that's all. So Mrs. Deewan's sent you. Yes. What were your daughter's scores in class 9? 47%. And maths. She barely passed in maths. Would you like some tea? Look, Chanda. The thing about coaching classes are... we offer discount to students with marks above 75%. But, sir, don't weak students need coaching, Absolutely right. But coaching classes need good results. Which we get only from above average students. And if they're already good... than, they don't need us. So we've to give them discount. Since Mrs. Deewan's sent you... I'll give you a special offer. If your daughter, scores more than 50%... in her pre-board exams... Then I'll give you 50% discount for the clash course. Okay? Goodbye. Come, dance with me. Let's do it. Sit here, Chanda. See you guys tomorrow. To get you educated, I wipe floors, day and night. And, here you are enjoying and having a chat? Why didn't you come home in the afternoon? I had to eat noodles. Appu, did you hear what I said? This T.V has made life hell here. Better to kill this T.V. You say this every day. Mrs. Deewan had a word with Mr. Gupta... for your maths tuitions. And he's prepared to give you a discount. But, for this, in pre-board exams... first you need to score at least 50% in maths. And you will do it. At any cost, get that. Mom. Have you lost your mind? What will I gain by passing my SSC exams. And even if I do it, do you have the money... to pay for my further education? I'll end up as a maid. So what good is education? Say that again and I'll break your teeth. Doctor's son... doctor... No good in studies... but excellent in talking crap. And what's this language you're using? You've lost all manners too. Who were you calling crazy? Donkey! I will arrange for the money that's not the problem. But scoring 50% in pre-board... seems too far-fetched for her. Looking at Appu's attitude, I feel they'll fail her in her semester exams. Yesterday I peeked at her books. I couldn't understand a word. It used to be easier before. But everything's in English now. You know... if I could understand... Then, I would've definitely tutored her. But my position in maths is 'Nil Battey Sannata''. What? It's a proverb. Used for someone who's beyond help. Well, what a proverb! What if you get a chance to study again? Will you teach me? My position in maths is 'Nil Battey Sanaata' too. Wonderful. It's hard luck all the way. I can't teach her or get her tuitions. Will you go hack to school? What? Will you go back to school? Yes, let's go to school> Why don't we both go together? We'll trouble the teachers. I am not joking. I'm very serious. What will I do in school? Make pickles. Study, and teach your daughter. No, this isn't done. You're sounding absurd. This isn't a film, its reality. What were you were making noise about? Well, it doesn't cost money to make noise. So what? And anyway, who would give me admission at this age? Don't worry about that. Do you have the courage? Chanda, let's go. We're getting late... Thanks. Going back to school at this age could be so humiliating. And what happens when Appu becomes a maid? Look, school ends in the afternoon. Tuck it in. That means my job at the spice factory... will have to be shifted an hour later. That means I'll arrive... an hour late at the shoe factory. They will definitely clobber me there. Aren't you done with the pins? Chanda, Do I look good? And if I go back to school'. I'll have to pay for the uniform, school fee, books. -pens, pencils, commuting. -Coming. 'The dough is runny in poverty'. Close all the windows and doors before you leave. What happened? I forgot that. If I start going to school... I'll have to come an hour earlier at your home? What than? That means we'll have to wake up an hour earlier. What if I fail myself? Won't that be terrible? -Are you carrying the envelope? -Yes. Look, Chanda, if it's so difficult. then don't get into this mess. Let her become a maid. Shall we? -Close the door... -Close it. Are you okay? Why? Nothing. I used to your chattering. That's why I asked. You know, I think you should join Appu's school. Appu's school? Ma'am... Private school fee are too high. There must be other government schools. If you join Appu's school, her class... she'll make less mistakes. Right? Secondly, you will know... what problems she is facing. Right? Appu will kill me. Bye. See you. Bye. Nothing will happen. Let's go meet his principal. What's his name? Srivastav. Get my phone, I'll fix an appointment. Oh Doctor, you needn't have taken the trouble. You should've just sent the student. It's a delicate situation. Its fine. Call her, I'll speak with her. Who? The student? Yes. Chanda. She's Chanda... Oh my, I forgot your surname. -Sahay. -Sahay. Chanda Sahay. Hello. Your kid wants admission, what class? Class 10... But... But class 10 is Board exam, so... So? So? Where did you do your 9th class? Nabodar Girl's High School, village Katra Bhatiyari Sharif, Post Jadhav Garhi. And district has been Mainpuri for a long time. Fine, take a seat. Madam, I'll try my best to get her child admitted. Is it a boy or a girl? No, no. Not her child, she wants admission. -Her? -Yes. Where? Here. She wants admission in class 10. You mean... she'll study in out school. Yes. In class 10. Yes, With the kids? Yes, Mr. Srivastav. Impossible? Why? Why? Even I want to know why? Means? There's a different school for workers... -If you want, I can put in a word. -No, no. -No! -No! She wants to study here. Madam, what's so special about this school... that she wants to study here? Appu. Apeksha. Apeksha Shivlal Sahay. -She's my daughter. -The one in class 10. She's a dimwit. I mean she's weak in her studies. I know, sir. But... I am her mother after all. And, no matter how stupid the child is... the mother has an attachment. And I can't lose hope either. Sir, coaching classes are expenses... and, they don't accept dimwits either. I thought, if I can study myself.... I might be able to tutor her too. Who knows... there could be... one less dimwit in your school. No one will know she's my daughter. And I won't give you a reason to complain. I swear. I won't give you an opportunity. I respect your thought. I mean... I respect her sentiments. But... this is a government school. Isn't this your interview? Yes, it's your picture. Yes. -Dawn is when you rise. -Yes. So... The awakening that came in 94, December... Even your government says... Yes... educate girls, help country progress. -Yes. -Right? Treat it like an experiment. By the way, you two have surrounded me. But, madam... this is a legal matter. -So, I'll have to talk to my senior. -Of course. -It's a special case. -Yes. Can I make a call? It's your phone, sir. Yes. Yes, it's done. I'll come back and tell you. He wants to know what Srivastav said. What now? Why are you sulking now? What are you thinking? What will Appu think? Are you insane? Or lost your mind? You should've thought about my respect? How could the Principal allow you in school? Is it his father's school? Look, if you join school, then I'll quit for good. Who gave you such a miserable idea? Okay... You want me to concentrate on my studies, don't you? I'll study. I'll start studying right now. See my marks in the next test. Please, mom. Don't come to school. All my friends will mock me. They will humiliate me. I'll be a laughing stock! Please, mom. Fine, I won't come. I won't watch television either. Or go out to play. I'll study hard. I'll go study. I'll go study right now. 1 am going. Go. What? Go on. I am going. I'll go study. What happened? Nothing. Sit. Children... The dawn is when you rise. -You must have heard this proverb. -Yes, sir. Today you will see it. Come in. Come! Who is she? She's your new classmate. Chanda Sahay! Chanda Sahay. Will you help her? Yes, sir. Will you help her? Yes, sir. Winners or losers? Winners. Very nice. Chanda, sit. At this age, women apply bindi to their forehead. But this madam has come her to study... English, Maths and Hindi. Aunty, please move aside we can't see the board. Hey! Please come! Children. x square - 9x + 18 is equal to... Zero. Where were you all day? Where were you? What do you care? I am doing this for your own good, dear. You can come back and wash them. Ma'am, your newspaper. You've school. -How was your first day? -How else? All the kids were staring at me, like unknowingly, my man... # And it became known, when her daughter-in-law lifted the blanket. And everyone was staring at me. I was feeling so ashamed. That's true. But how was the class? Other subjects were fine. But maths... Curse this maths. I couldn't understand a thing. And you know, ma'am. It seemed like maths class was never-ending. Now you can understand poor Appu's situation. Do you find maths easy? No. I find it interesting. Who will explain this? Pintu, you do it. I'll explain it once I understand. Son, for that you'll have to work hard. And that's difficult for you. You can prepare for a hat-trick in your exams. Sit! By the way, why don't you bring lunch? I've no one to make it for me. Why do you come to school? I've no one to teach me. I've brought extra for you. You not pitying me, are you? Yes, I am. I mean... I meant... I won't eat for free. I'll teach you maths in return. Are you taking pity on me? I am your mother, child. Don't try to be my father. Sweetheart, you slapped me so hard. Just like... Sin theta / Cos theta is equal to... Tan theta. Associate maths with your daily life. It will seem interesting. Okay. Tan! The plate slipped from my hand and fell with a loud bang. Sec square theta / Tan square theta is 1. Sec square theta - Tan square theta is... what? Chanda. You answer this. The plate slipped from my hand... and fell with a loud bang. -Sec square - Tan square? -Well. -One. -What? -Sir, one. Correct. Very good. Chanda's answer is absolutely right. One. Clap for Chanda. Enough. You should be happy. After all, your student answered correctly. Yes... That is what I am happy for. Hi... I am Sweety and he's Pintu. And that's Apeksha. Apeksha, come here. Don't be so egoistic. By the way, you answered really well. Amar taught me all this. By the way, her surname's Sahay too. What are you doing? Eating my lunch. Don't... Why? Just go. Have it. Your vegetables taste similar. How? Don't you know? Makes all food come alive. MDH spices. Where do you live? Behtaab Bagh. That's where Appu stays. Further. Much further than Behtaab Bagh. Very far. I see. If you think of becoming a driver... you'll be driving for others all your life. Have ever thought about how you will buy a car for yourself? No, right. Looking at you... I'm sure... you don't think about the future. If you study hard, and be successful, not you, but others will imitate you. Have you ever thought that? Appu, come here. Chanda Sahay. You deserve a mark more for your efforts. I am your enemy... Children... There are two children who are praiseworthy. First is... Chanda Sahay. She started late but caught up. And she passed with good marks in this unit test. Very good, Chanda. Keep it up. And the other is... Apeksha, will you please come here? Apeksha... She's fulfilled my expectations. She has a good speed as well. But in the other direction. Last time she scored 30, then 20. And now... it's 10. Where will you stop, Apeksha? I am sure... in the next exams. she will score a big zero. Zero. And make Sri Aryabhatt proud. I am really sad. It's sad for me. Now go! Appu. Appu, listen to me. Listen, dear. Appu... Appu, listen. Let her come. Are you satisfied now? That grouch was humiliating me... and you were laughing. No, Appu. I didn't laugh at all. I swear. Everyone was laughing. I noticed you were too. Why will anyone laugh if you pass your exams. Save your preaching for Sweety and Pintu. Don't think you're a heroine because you passed. You're just a maid! I see. You're not upset that you failed. In fact, you're upset because... a maid passed. Wonderful, Appu. Bravo. So... why shouldn't I be? You stole my friends too. I didn't steal your friends. They feel ashamed to be with you. What do you think? Only you can score good marks? And I can't do it? If you could, you would have got good marks by now. And I wouldn't have paying fees for two people. Fine, then quit school. Great, you keep failing and I should quit school. If I pass, will you quit school? No. But if you score more marks than me in maths, I'll quit. Fine. If, in the next exams, I don't score more marks than you in maths... then my name isn't Appu. And if I don't show you your place... then I am not your mother. -Anjali Shanna. -Present sir! -Anupama Mishra. -Yes, sir. -Apeksha Sahay. -Yes, sir. Oh... Vinod Shanna. Chirag Dubey. Deepak Kumar. Children, this is a circular running track. And its radius... is 49 meters. So, what will be length... of the entire track? Who will tell me? Do you want to take a break? Sir, answer. I'll tell you in a while. Wait. Sir, can I answer? You want to answer? Wow! Finally, there's some light. Tell us. Sir, 280 meter? Gone. The light's gone again. Wrong answer. Yes, Chanda. You tell us. Sir, 308 meters. Right. Absolutely right. Good. Come on, next question. When you've a chance to study... don't let these chores tie you down? Okay, come on. Shift! I want to score better in the semester exams. I'll study everything you say. maths must not be memorized, needs to be understood. You know, sometimes I think... -Consider that... -You think too much. Yes, but still. Consider that Appu passes her class 10 exams. What's the best she can do? At the most, she can take up a job... at some beauty parlour. Because, I really don't have... the resources to make her a doctor or engineer. And that's the truth. I think... if Appu passes class 10... then, she'll do the right thing. Is that what you think? Yes. Okay. You've been chattering in English a lot these days. Are you blind? Pick up your stuff. What are you staring at? You're delaying the Collector. Can't you hear? Come on, fast! Dayal, along with the tobacco, have you also eaten your manners? Is this the way to speak to a lady? I am sorry, it's our fault. Apologize. Sorry. -Pick up her bag. -Okay, sir! Sorry. Dayal! A buffalo was tied to a stick in the garden. So, the stick is the centre. The wire's the radius. And the glass be ate becomes the area. What's wrong? Do you know where the Collector lives? Hello, brother. Is this the Collector's house? No, it's Shahrukh Khan's. I wanted to meet him. He's gone out, on an inspection tour. Who is she? I don't know. Come on, go now. Leave! Leave. She's back even on a Sunday. Please let me meet him, please. I'll be very brief. Please. They just come here and request us... to allow them in. Wonder where these come from? Show some manners. I'll beat you black and blue with this stick. Just try and touch me. I'll disfigure your face. I'll break your jaw. And shove this stick up yours. Scoundrel. I've been talking respectfully, but you don't listen. I've been coming here for 10 days. Is he God? It's easier to behold God at the temple. Who do you think you are? Some collector? Are you? I am a great Collector. Many people come here. Aren't you ashamed? I've been so polite for the past few days. Now will you understand when I abuse you? -Bachchu Singh? -Yes, Sir. What's going on here? Sir. Sir, I am Chanda. The other day, you almost ran over me with your car. I want to talk to you about something important. I've been coming for 10 days. But he doesn't let me see you. -Let her in. -Yes, sir. Come in. Go in. -First make an entry. -Yeah. -So make an entry. -Take her in. Go... Come, sit. Sit. Yes. Sit, I am Chanda. Chanda Sahay. I work as a domestic maid for Dr. Deewan. -Dr. Deewan. -Yes. But... right now... we don't have any jobs to offer you now. No, sir. I didn't come here looking for work. I wanted to ask you something. Yes, go ahead. Which college does one need to attend, to be like you? You mean... to be a Collector... which college should one attend... Yes. Well, there's a separate college for engineers... and for doctors, so... to become a Collector, which college can one attend... There's no specific college that you need to go to. You can attend any normal college. But after that, one has to... take UPSC exams. One minute. Badri, bring tea. Let me write that down. Up... UPSC. Have tea. Sir, what about the fee? Doesn't cost much. But yes, it requires lot of hard work. And... to attend these exams, one has to go to coaching centres and... go for tuitions also? Some do. I didn't. Couldn't afford it. For a year, I locked myself in my room... and studied hard. But why are you asking all this? For my daughter Appu... Apeksha. Great. So your daughter wants to join the Civil Services. I mean she wants to be a Collector. God bless you. Finish your tea. I just wanted to find out about this UPSC. Okay, hold on. Badri. Yes, sir! Ask Ram Singh to take madam wherever she wants to go. No, no, I'll manage. -It's okay... -It's alright. He'll drop you. Thank you, sir. Good luck. Children... this is today's question. Who will solve it? Or should I do it? Sir, may I? Amar. I knew you would. Why is maths so difficult? You don't understand maths, because, you never tried to understand it. Try to make friends with maths, you'll find it very interesting. Why do you read every question for so long? Secret no. 1 about maths. The answer is hidden in the question. Read it carefully few times, and you'll see the answer. Read it. A circular park has a diameter of 28 meters. There's a patch of grass in the middle... and it's diameter is 14 meters. There is a path surrounding the patch, for jogging. So, what's the width of the path? Did you understand? Okay, read it again and this time, try to understand. 7 meters? Correct. You're finally here. You could've turned up a bit later. Actually, sit, I had a personal problem so... Go, start working. Ma'am the laundry guy's given your sari. What's wrong? Are you ill? I'm fine. -You overslept again. -It's only 7 o'clock. Get up, you ruined the bed. I feel overwhelmed watching you in this uniform. All I want is Appu to concentrate on her studies. You know... it's the effect of my fast. I've been praying to Lord Hanuman on Tuesdays and Saturdays. It's not the effect of your fasts, it's the bet. Well, it's both. Look, food cooked on a slow flame... tastes better. Be hasty, and it will burn. I'm getting late, see you. Get up. Sachin has retired. Sachin... Sachin... Cricket without Sachin... Yes. Cricket without Sachin... is like a tyre without tube. Volume of sphere 4/3 (Pi) r cube. 4 (Pi) r square. Square... sphere... Sphere... Sphere... lion... Lion... You're a mutt, don't think you're a lion. Circumference of sphere 4 (Pi) r square. X - 5 km. per hour. Volume of a cylinder... (Pi) r square h. Appu. Appu, today's your exams. Don't be late. Appu, do you remember the bet? Do you want me to wake up, Appu? She's wide awake, Sazia. Stop. Stop. Sir, please. Sir... Hurry up. Give it. What happened? One moment, sit. You can refill your pen next year. You'll still he in the same class. Give it. Give it. Chanda. Give it up. Come on, son. Give it. -Apeksha... -Sir, just a minute. What about the 6 months that I gave you? -Sir... -Give it. -Sir... -Give it. -Sir... -Yes! -Ninety nine. -Minus one. I never felt this bad even when I failed. I knew all the answers. If only I had a little more time. I could score full marks. You will never get that. Why not? That's the last secret. Practice. Practice. Practice. Fine, we'll see. Dammit! The bell always rings at the wrong time. I never felt this bad even when I failed. I knew all the answers. If only I had a little more time. I could score full marks. What? How was it? How was it? Good. And yours? Good. Really? Brilliant! Chanda. You've made good progress... but, there's still room for improvement. 52 out of 100. Apeksha. This time you didn't meet my expectations. And I am happy. Very good. 58 out of 100. Babloo Srivastav. Sir, some important work came up, so... No problem. I can see you're tried. Go home and rest. No, I'll come on time from now on... Here's your 10 day's salary. Sir... Come on! I couldn't even hug you in school. Look, I brought chow-mein for you. We'll have a party tonight. I always knew. You've the capability and strength. You just lacked hard work. And you filled that void too. Did you see the principal's face? He was so dumbstruck. He's blown a fuse. And this is just the beginning. Today you merely passed your exams. But tomorrow... you'll come first. Then college. UPSC... and you'll he a Collector in no time. Here. And then you'll have a bungalow. Car with blue light... security... and respect. And don't worry about the fee. You know, I've already been saving... for your coaching class fee. Just concentrate on your studies. Dear... You know... that bet was just a charade. I don't like going to school either. I'll stop from tomorrow, alright. I swear. That's exactly what I wanted? To be a Collector? I concentrated on my studies... so that I could get you off my back. I gained something from all that studying. What are you blabbering? You couldn't do anything yourself. And now you want to assert your dreams on me. I am going to school, that's more than enough. And anyway, you don't have the money to send me to college... Nor am I interested. You're joking, Appu. Right? Yes, we're leaving today evening. Yes, aunty. Our flight leaves tonight. No, no, I don't want these saris. -That's silk, like you said. -No. Yes, aunty. Okay, we'll talk later. Okay, bye. -This is your Kashmiiri coat. -I don't want it. I've cleaned the kitchen. Switched off the gas and disconnected the pipe. Don't worry about the house. I'll visit twice a week and clean the place. After removing all the dresses. What's wrong with you? Come here. Come on. Sit here. Sit here. What's wrong with you? You're leaving, it's really upsetting. Sooner I go, sooner I'll be back. Keep this. Three months pay. Keep it, it will come in handy. If you go, I'll be completely alone. Vinod Shanna. Chirag Duhey. Chanda Sahay. Dinesh Chaubey. This is it. -Did you meet Sunny? -Okay I'll move, Chanda. And you? Chanda! -How are you? -I am fine. And Pintu boss. Today, how did you reach school on time? -Are they studying? -Yes. And you're early today. I want to talk to you. I don't want to talk to you. You're going back on your words. Don't touch me. You said you won't come to school again. So why the charade? Why? Are you the only one who can pretend? You can do whatever you like? I'll come to school every day. And in the upcoming exams, I'll show you where you belong... Understand? You're crazy, Chanda. That gill will never change. I know. But if I accept defeat... then I'll never win in life. And let's consider... And let's consider. If she scores more than 50% in the pre-board exams. Then? I should have the money. Right? In this Unit Test, Pintu and Sweety... you two... have passed. And Apeksha... You're hack to square one. Fail. Time's up. Chanda, this is yours, and the other children's. Now... the score's settled. Scores settled. Let's party. Party? What for? Because my friends passed. But money? Leave it to me. Two Chicken Margaritas. And cheese and tomato pizza. And sweet corn soup. And... chocolate cake. -Take. -Should I pour? Appu, where were you? Why didn't you show up in the afternoon? I had kept money in the sugar jar. Did you see them? Where were you? Where's the money? What's this? What is this? Did you steal the money? I pardoned all your mistakes... and you robbed your own house. I don't have the money to educate you. I had saved that money with great difficulty. And you spent all of it in one day. It wasn't your hard earned money. What did you say? Say that again. I've seen the guy who drops you everyday. That was all I had to heat! You think I'm enjoying myself? I'm enjoying myself? I slog all day and night for you. I break my back working for you, but you think I enjoying myself. Aren't you ashamed? Is that what you say? You stole my money and yelling at me instead. Bitch. You didn't do any favour to me. Why don't you just die? It'll be an end to all my trouble. You're trouble, nothing more. You think this is a joke. Three months rent, Ration, school fees... how are we going to pay for all that? I don't care. Appu, you... You can't even become a maid, Appu. You can do anything you like. You can rot in hell, as if I care. I won't say a thing. And forgive me for thinking about your well being. It was my fault. Chanda Sahay. Yes, sir. Chanda. Yes, sir. Roll no. 33? Yes sir. Where is Chanda? Yes, I miss her. Her or her pickles? Both. Everyone will write an essay on this tomorrow. Everyone will write on their own. No one's going to copy. And everyone will have to read out... their essay in front of the entire class. Understand? My dream is to become a driver. You call that a dream. Sweety, everyone will laugh at me. Who told you to have such a lowly dream? I didn't know we'll have to write an essay unit. By the way, Sweety, what are you going to write? Don't know. Appu, what are you going to write? Paupers don't have the right to dream. Really speaking, the poor is one who does not have a dream. Cow is our mother. I don't know a thing. I mean... you must be the only girl in the world, Apeksha... who has no dream of her own. Take it. Take it. See... my new style. How is it? Nice. Look. Nice. What's wrong, Appu? Say something. Why are you so quiet? What's on your mind, Appu? We followed in your footsteps. and made it to first bench. And you... reached the last bench? You know... everyone is working really hard... preparing for the pre-board exams. And you're sulking here. Appu. Let's go, Sweety. What's going on? What do you care? Where's Chanda? I don't know. Why ask me? You know why. I know everything, but you don't. What? What do you know? That she's your mother. Then you must also know where she goes these days, what she does. Yes, I do. Appu, you have too many questions. But you never tried to find the answers. Remember what I said. The answers are hidden in the question. Where are you going? We'll meet at Delhi Gate at 8:30. Boss. -I'll be right hack. -Be hack soon. Do you know... why she works at a place like this? For you. You are one who has no expectations from yourself. And she... never stopped hoping for you. I don't know why, but she still thinks... that you'll score 50% marks in the pre-boards. And she'll need money to enrol you in coaching classes. She isn't imposing her dreams on you. You are her dream, Appu. That... is my elder brother. Your scooter guy. Pankaj. He also has hopes on me. At least I won't shatter his hopes. You must be hungry. Wait, I'll make something. How is it? Let it be. It's best you don't cook. Eat it. I want to sleep. -You eat. -No, I don't want to. You will stop going at the restaurant from tomorrow. Where will we get the money? We'll see about that. But you won't go there. Fine, dear, I won't go there. Happy? And you'll come to school. What's the point in coming to school? Just like you don't want your daughter to fail in exams... even I don't want... my mother to he a failure all her life. Sit. It's Chanda ma'am herself. Madam, thank you. Finally you found time to come to school. I mean... what an ideal class this is. One student is not interested in attending class... Another's not interested in dreaming. Chanda, you weren't here... so we couldn't know what your dreams are. So would you like to tell the class? Yes? Tell us... or stand outside. Come on! If you stay with such oafs, you'll all become fools. Can I tell you, sir? You don't have a dream of your own? Can you tell me hers? If Chanda didn't have dreams... then she wouldn't come to school and listen to your taunts. She works all day, gets tired. But still comes to school. The poor girl doesn't even get an off on a Sunday. Because... maids don't have a Sunday. But still on a Monday... she's present in class. With a big smile on her face. She doesn't care about the scorching heat or the rains. Nor makes an excuse about any illness. Do you know why, sir? Because she has just one dream. Because her daughter... shouldn't tell the class next time, that she doesn't have a dream. Go on. Sit down! You know, there's nothing wrong in failing. Really. What's wrong is admitting defeat without trying. Always I remember one thing. Your dream is only yours. Lot of people will laugh at your dreams. Ask them to go to hell. They can't accept your dream. There are few people... who will understand your dream. Keep them close. They will keep your dream alive. You will face difficulties on the way. That's for sure. But always I remember one thing. If you have your dream in your sights. no difficulty will last for too long. Just don't let your dreams out of your sight. Do you know why? Because if there's anything we have to progress in life... it's... our dreams. And no one can snatch it from us. Apeksha Sahay. Most girls don't choose maths. But you chose maths fol your UPSC exams. And excelled in it too. That's commendable. I would like to give Credit to my mother for that. What does your mother do? She gives maths tuitions to poor kids. For free. Good. Apeksha, why do you want to be IAS? Because... I don't want to he a maid!
