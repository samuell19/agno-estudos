Man: With ma gone... The cabin was just home... Just me, my father. Then he died, and then it was just me... And the loons. Then they... They took me away... Homes, foster homes, schools. Did you like being alone then? Alone? Yeah. I mean no. I mean...Yeah. Well, no one likes... No one likes being alone... Being left alone, really. There are no hassles. Where was your mother? [Sigh] The train... The train took her. That was-- that was ok, really because...my father... My father, he... Well... He was such a... Well, anyway, up there it was, uh... It was really great, you know. It was quiet, peaceful. And no people. Well, if you did go back there, how could you possibly earn a living? That's just the point. Up there by the lake, there was no need to earnanything. You don't owe. You don't need. You just live. [Loon cries] [Music playing] [Dog barking] [Bell clanging] [Bell ringing] Let's go, fellas. [Men grumbling] The game's over. Let's go. Fall in. Fall in. Let's move it! What the hell? Why? The shrink. The damned shrink. Steck, here. I'm sorry. You'll be at the lake tomorrow. That's still ok? Sure. It was always the best time of my life, the lake. It'll happen again. The next hearing, maybe-- sure. Sure. Here. It's for you. St. Christopher, the patron Saint of travelers. I like the sound. I'll get it back to you. I'll give it back to you... Before the summer's over... At the lake. [Footsteps approach] Man: Brewer? Yeah? You ready? Yeah. Yeah.

The guy in the top bunk is supposed to call out right away. And if he had? I would have got myself two day's vacation from the pen. That's all. That's all? You recommended they turn down my parole. You were trying to escape, you bastard, and you know it. You recommended it. Otherwise, why would they turn me down? I've been a model prisoner. Who is going to be crazy enough to turn loose some idiot who nearly burns himself to death, a cellmate, and god knows who else, eh? So now what? 20 milligrams of nardil? 10 milligrams of librium? Ought to keep me nice and docile. Is that what you want? It would help. 8 years is 2,900 days, 4,207,680 minutes. Think about that, doc. I'm going to offer you a deal. A deal? I won't extend my notes on this for the prison inquiry, if you'll come back to group sessions for 6 months. I don't like group. All right. Just you and me then. Well, the next time I try this, I'm going to put a wet sponge on my dick. I'd like to talk about that, doc. Do we have a deal? One on one? 6 months. See you. [Loon cries] [Dog barking] Ok, steckert.

I've got to get back to work. Here. Come on. Crackers. Hey, give me one! Ok. Ok. [Children talking] Steckert! Your guns... The guns. Over the fence! The fence! In! Hey, leave the boy. Come on. Take one of US. I'll go with you. Move! Shit. Oh, shit. [Siren] Man: This is hedley. 313 priority to all units. Escaped convict steckert has taken a child hostage and is heading north on walmpaugh street. Repeat: Subject has child hostage. He is driving stolen police cruiser number 212. Subject is armed and dangerous. We are in pursuit, traveling north on walmpaugh street. Priority to all units. I will repeat. Nobody is to come near me, or I will leave little bits of this kid up and down the highway. I've got guns, blades, and nothing to lose. The first little bits you'll find will be his fingers. Have you got that? Man: All units, stand by. All units, please stand by. Well, that ought to get US a couple of miles. Man: Set up the coordination and tracking facilities, but don't touch him. Don't make him nervous. I'll need a full prison report, associates, psychiatric file, whatever. Oh, and the kid's parents will probably need someone to hold their hands, so, uh... I've been married for 23 years. Know the secret to a happy marriage? Yes, sir. Eat out. Eat out. Priority order to all units. Stolen police vehicle 212, subject of code 214 violation, must not be approached. Repeat. Do not approach stolen police vehicle number 212. Wow! Priority order to all units. You know... You know, we could get to enjoy this. Do not approach stolen police vehicle number 212. Listen, kid... I'm not going to touch you. I promise. That's a hard, fast promise. Ok? What's your name? Martin. Martin John kingsly. Why, that's my name. My name is Martin. Wow! Well, can you believe that? Of all the kids in the world, I had to find myself a twin! Ha ha ha! [Truck rumbles] The brakes! Hit the brakes! [Honk] [Honk honk] [Creaking] Martin! [Thud] [Slam] Martin! [Door opens] Is that you, Jim? What's the matter, son? Martin: He's got a gun. He'll come in here. Wait a minute. Take your time and get your breath back. Then I'll hear what the trouble is. No one's going to do you no harm in this house. But he's going to kill me. Steckert: Martin! Man: There's a telephone in the kitchen. I want you to dial "o" and ask Mrs. Carrie for the police station. Go on. It's on the wall there. [Creaking] Come on, Martin. Come on back. No. The boy's staying right here, mister. This gun is loaded. This your kid? [Cocks gun] I'll take him if I have to, but I want Martin. Dad. I'll count to 5. 1... 2... 3... 4... Doctor: Excuse me. Could you tell me where lieutenant lardner is? Hello. Dr. Mennen? Yes. Lieutenant lardner. Thank you for coming. Won't you sit down? Thank you. So, I understand he's one of your sweethearts. I'm paid to help him, not check the locks. Well, tell me about him. Well, in a funny way, he's a pretty likable guy. He's whimsical. He lives in another world. But he's very bright, and he's polite in an old-fashioned sort of way. He's from an Irish family, brought up in Ontario. And is this whimsical, likable, old-fashioned irishman a killer? I've had him on 20 milligrams of librium for the last two years. Seems to control his temper. I've been on 20 mls. A day for half my life. Well, then, in your case, it's still working. But he's without his now. Could he kill the boy? I don't think he would. He's-- he's very erratic. I suppose he could, yes. What do you think he wants? I--i don't know. The thing is-- that's important for you to understand-- is that if steckert is not attacked, if--if you don't corner him, the boy will be fine. Yes. The boy's safety is our first priority. We'll track steckert until we stop him. We'll negotiate with him if we can. If that fails, we'll kill him. I have to go to the bathroom. Hey. How about doing it right where you are? Oh. You want me to, uh... Look the other way or something? But if you try to make another run for it... I've got an idea, ok? I'll make you a deal-- a hard, fast deal. I won't look if you keep talking all the time you're... Well, all the time. Ok? Ok. What will I say? I don't know. Say anything. Just keep talking all the time. That's part of the hard, fast deal. Who made you? God made me. Why did god make me? God made me to know him, love him, and serve him in this world, and to be happy with him ever after in the next. In whose image and likeness did god make you? God made me... He made me... To his own image and likeness. Is this likeness to god in your body or in your soul? This likeness to god is chiefly in my soul. You couldn't remember it, could you? I was meant to know it for scripture class today. Well, it's a good thing I kidnapped you, then. Come on. Thank you. Steckert on tape: You're talking about real pressure-- like, inside you're calm, but inside the inside, there's this rising... Rage. You don't want it? I'm not allowed to eat candy except at weekends. It's our dentist. The dentist. The goddamn dentist. He says candy is bad for your teeth. Listen, do you like candy? Of course you do. You're my prisoner, right? And you're supposed to do everything I tell you to do, right? Well, eat the goddamn candy or I'll break your head in. Point 14. 1-4. Subject car heading north about 60. Where's he headed? I don't think he knows. How do you expect me to? What would you do if you knew where he was going? Well, he's an escaped convict. He's armed, dangerous, possibly psychopathic, he's just kidnapped a young boy... What the hell do you suppose I would do? Come with me. I want you to talk to him. What would you like me to say? You're the doctor. I want you to negotiate with him. Now, what else won't they let you do? I'm not allowed to practice the violin in the house, and I'm not allowed to have a dog. Not allowed to have a dog? Well, I had one, but he got run over. That's too bad. Well, why don't you ask your dad to give you another one? I don't see him much... Except at weekends. They're divorced. And your mother remarried, right? Right. I don't think my new dad likes me too much. He's got his own son, but he's only 6. And I'm not allowed to talk with my mouth full. Man on radio: Vehicle 212, stand by. Vehicle 212, please stand by. Mennen: ...Dialogue, steckert. No deals. No pressure. But if you'll talk to me, perhaps we can work something out, eh? I know you can hear me. Steck, I want to talk to you. Now, look, it's important. Maybe... Maybe we can get them to review the decision. But I'll have to speak to you about it. We'll have to talk it through. There's no tricks here. [Sigh] Talk to me, damn it! [Turns radio off] [Static] And if i'm going to be late, I have to call home. Oh. We'll have to find you a phone, then. Right. Get your ass out here! This is the police! [Siren] You're supposed to send service! Come on! Move it! Move it! [Siren shuts off] Man: I'm coming. Come on! I'm coming! You want it right up? Right up. Oh. That be cash or credit? Cash. Oh. Where do you keep it? Where do I keep what? Cash. My pocket. In your pocket? Darn right. I only look stupid. That's true. Oh, shit. Come on. This is Friday. Well, that's all I've got. Wow. Well, let's see now. That's, uh... $24.25. 5... 15... 20, 25. You owe me 75 cents. I owe you? You owe me 75 cents. I want it for a phone call. [Ringing] Hi, mom. Woman: Hi. This is patsy and Bobby's home. We're out fooling around right now, but we'll get back to you as soon as we can. Speak after the tone. Hold on. Here it comes. [Beep] Mom, it's me. I'm ok. [Steckert humming] I left word. Oh. Hey. You can keep those. No. Go on. Let's go. The leaves are changing now. Can't see that from the pen. Why are you doing this? I can't let you go. I'm sorry. Ok. I'm not going to hurt you, kid. You must know that by now, don't you? It's just that... Well, sometimes I get mad, and I hit out. But I can control that now. I just scare them because they don't understand. But I've learned to handle myself ok, though. Is that why you were in jail? Hitting somebody? No--i mean, yes. Well, really, no. The first time, I was a kid--17. It was a mistake. When you're a kid--17-- and spend two years in the pen, you learn some things that you shouldn't-- well, that you sh-- it doesn't matter. Let's go. Now, you can't get busted for stealing the car because I stole it, right? Right. So... Want a beer? He doesn't want to hurt that boy. He never did. Well, I'm sure the kid feels grateful for your confidence. He let the boy call his home. That proves he's crazy. You know what he's in for. Yeah, I do. He's in for 8 years. That's what he's in for. The last time, it was 3 years, and the time before that, it was two years. Wait a minute. You're feeling sorry because you kept this psycho in jail. If we'd let him out quietly on parole, this just would never have happened. No, no. You kept him in because you know something about him. Now come on. Why don't you tell me where he's at, huh? Come on. Please tell me where he's going. He is going anyplace, anyplace he can find where there is no one to confuse or anger or--or--or organize or neglect him. That's where he's going. No matter what happened before, I promise you I will not ignore or neglect Martin steckert now. Man: Target car approaching, 2 kilometers. Travel speed, 50 kph. Estimated intersect, 2 minutes, 30 seconds. Steckert: Ha ha ha ha! Hey, look at that! You're doing great! Man: Confirm the ground car is ready. Is the interception car ready? Target car estimated to intersect in 115 seconds hey, look! 55 miles an hour! It's kilometers. Ok. Ha ha ha! Check... Have you never driven before? Never. You're terrific! Move over! I'm sorry, Martin. I really am. Let's stop and eat, ok? Maybe ice cream... Banana split. Do you like banana splits? You ok now? What do you say? How about a double cheeseburger? [Siren] Get my hat. Hey, officer, I don't know what the hell you're stopping me for. I haven't done a damn thing, ok? Stick 'em up! Oh, my god. You. Out. Come on. Stand there. Open the back. Yes, sir. Martin! What? When is your birthday? May 25. Wrong. It's today. Go on. Oh, my god. Go on. Wow! Wow! Come here. Ahh! Ha ha ha! Happy birthday, Martin. By the way... Huh? Where's the nearest eating place on this road? What? Restaurant, cafe-- the best one on this road? There's a half-way house about 15 miles on the-- maybe 20-- on the right. Thank you. Well... Thank you. Why did he take all his clothes off? Because I told him to. Why? They make you do that every day of your life in the pen. I think that's stupid. [Beeping] Yeah! Yeah! Got it! Man: Two men are now in position, sir. Thank you, James. What? What are you doing? They're stopping at a roadside cafe. The half-way cafe, as it is wittily called-- apparently because it's halfway between the border and the north pole. The road will be blocked off as soon as steckert and the boy get into the area, and we have a marksman in position. And with luck, we'll get off one clear head shot. Listen, steckert's reflexes aren't like yours and mine. You know, if we were shot, we'd be thinking about the pain, but that man set himself on fire, lardner. Pain is secondary to his obsessions. Listen to me. If you shoot him, if you wound him, he'll be like a grizzly, striking out at anything in range. They're 6 kilometers out, sir. Thank you. We'll be using a hollow-nosed projectile, and I'm afraid not even a grizzly bear can strike out with its head blown off. Man: Son of a bitch. We'll go around the back. Down there. Right. Hey, you back there! We've been waiting for 200 and--how many? 90. 290 seconds! Come on! How come you don't have a girlfriend? I've got a girlfriend. She lives around here somewhere. Lakefield. Ah, she was the best-- loyal, pretty, smart. Writes great letters. Used to write to me a lot. Then she moved-- moved away, out of the city. Her and me... We used to have great times together. There are two-- what? I'm hungry. [Honk honk] Hurry it up. Hurry it up. I can't get a steady shot. Now, let me catch my breath. How much? $10.00, please. 20. Thank you. Damn it! Oh. They didn't get a shot off! Well, look at it this way. Now you have the opportunity of doing it to him yourself. Just--i may just have to stand in line to do that. Steckert: Can you read a map? Martin: I could read a map since I was 7. Can you find me highway 830? Ok. Hey, you know, we're only 10 miles from lakefield. We should go visit your girlfriend. Oh... Nah...nah. Ah, come on. I'm still hungry, and I bet you want to get laid. That's a fine-looking boy you've got there, officer. Are you going to be a cop when you-- I'm sorry-- a policeman when you grow up like your father here? Now, speak up, son. Well, speak up, son. He asked you a question. You tell him, then. Go on. Just asking if you're going to be a policeman like your old man here. Yeah, yeah. Yeah? A policeman or a violinist. I hear the police force is a pretty good life, you know. Say, do you mind if I try that thing? I'm pretty good at these things. I've just never seen one of those before. Can I... Yeah. Thanks a lot. That's a good life, the police force. That's what I hear. It's a good choice. His mother doesn't think so, though, does she, son? No. Mom doesn't think he gets enough money. Always complaining about money, money, money. Well, money isn't everything, is it? It is to mom. She's always on about money. She wants vacations and clothes-- now, now, now, now, now. Mustn't talk like that about your mother. Mind you, the violin is a very nice instrument to play. Probably won't make as much being a policeman as a violinist, I'm sorry to say. Excuse me, have you got a license to drive? A driver's license? Yeah, sure. You could do US a great favor. Yeah? Have you ever driven a police car? No. Come on. Are we going to the lake? We're going, we're going. [Music playing] [Doorbell ringing] What do you want? It's me. Marty steckert. Christ, you think I don't know? You're--you're-- you're on every newscast. You'd better get in here. We've got neighbors, you know. Come on. Wow. Look at me, look at me, look at me! Here's $35. That's all I've got left in the house. And then I want you to get the hell out of here. I've got a date in a half an hour. I don't need the money. You don't need the money? No. Then what are you doing here? I came to see you. We had some good times together, you and me. Steck, I've been married and divorced since I saw you last-- twice. Mommy? She's cute. Now she's cute. Just give her 10 minutes. And about-- what about, uh... It seems he's released the boy, sir. You look good. I can look better. Listen, you and me-- I figure, we-- we never made it to the lake, did we? We never got further than belmont tavern. Would you like to come with US now? You're crazy, you know that? I remember, you used to say a lot of things to me, and I never understood half of them, but you were never crazy, steck. Ok, ok.

In 10 years, you can work up one hell of a pile of sweet dreams. 10 years? I was just a little kid then. I was just a baby. Yeah. I guess you were then. Should we go? Ok. Are you still scared of me? Yeah. Why? Because you got mad back there. Hey, kid. Yeah. I'll make you a deal. A hard, fast deal? Hard and fast. I won't scare you ever again if you go over there buy US a couple of cokes. Me? Alone? You've got to trust a friend. Oh, no. He couldn't. He couldn't. Martin: Steck! Yeah, I know. They both like cheeseburgers, and the kid likes toys. You think that's funny? No. It's just that... It seems to me that they are both having a ball. Come on. Now think about it. Most kids grow up with "don't fight me," "do your homework," "eat your dinner," and "keep off the grass." Now, for the first time, this kid has found somebody who doesn't give a shit about the rules, a friend who probably listens to him, who scares him, who likes him, and who definitely never says, "what the hell do you know? You're just a kid." They have both broken out of prison. Yeah, well, how come they're having such a great time and we're not? Because it's our job to put them back in. I've got to get home for a couple of hours. Why? I keep some files there. No, no. No. I need you here. For what? You're the policeman, philosopher, psychologist, all in one. You also need the rest of my material on steckert. My home number, in cases of acute anxiety. Steckert: Hey, what's the matter? Come on. The cat got your tongue? Come on, what is it? Tell me. We didn't get to steal a sports car. What? You want US to go back and get one? Would you? No, but...i would like to drive a train. [Train whistle blowing] What the hell do you think you're doing? What the hell does it look like? This is a holdup. What is it, Bernie? It's a holdup. Martin: Stick 'em up. What? Stick 'em up. Steckert: You heard what he said. Tell him again, kid. Stick 'em up. Listen, there's nothing to steal on this train. Nothing? It's the principle of the thing. Now, I want you to show US both how to drive this train, right? Go on, kid. Well, uh, first of all, this pedal down here is the dead man's stop. And the throttle there-- him. You teach him. He's a child. And you're the teacher. With ma gone... The cabin was just home. Just me, my father. And then he died. And then it was just me... And the loons. Take it away, Mr. Train driver. Yeah. Ok. Foot on the dead man. Release the air brake. Gear to forward. Throttle to eight. We're moving! Yeah! [Whistle blowing] [Signal dinging] [Whistle blowing] [Signal dinging] [Whistle blowing] I'm hungry, kid. What? I think we ought to stop now. Ok. Come on. We're heading that way. That was a dumb thing to do. It could cause an accident. It's a funny thing about trains. They take people apart. Let's go. And there was this old guy who spent his whole life on the lake, and he had his oars attached to the canoe, right? Then one day, early morning, they found the canoe empty. Yeah. Just drifting, just drifting. And they never ever found out what happened to him, except that one night, every year about the same time, the sound of his oars and the creaking of the oarlocks could be heard. One night every year. But every night, you could hear the loons calling. [Loon calls] Just wait till you hear the loons. You know, this is stealing. Stealing? You think we paid for the toys, the pickup truck, the train, the police car? Now shut up and keep on paddling. Can you check with transport h.Q. Again? Over and out. What's gonna be next, the qe2? So, where's Dr. Mennen? Did you find her? I don't know. Her husband said she's gone to work. I called the hospital, and she's not there either. So... Train stopped just south of orrville. Carrying a canoe is stupid. Will you stop saying everything is stupid!
