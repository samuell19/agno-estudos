- ALL TOO OFTEN, OUR HAPPIEST MEMORIES ARE PACKED AWAY IN HARD-TO-REACH PLACES, BUT WHEN YOU FIND SOMETHING LONG FORGOTTEN, YOU REDISCOVER WHAT YOU KNEW ALL ALONG. [snapping] [shimmering] THIS IS THE STORY OF A TOWN THAT HAD FORGOTTEN, AND THE ONE MAGICAL WINTER THAT MADE EVERYONE REMEMBER. [bouncy music] ¶ FROSTY THE SNOWMAN WAS A JOLLY HAPPY SOUL ¶ ¶ WITH A CORNCOB PIPE AND A BUTTON NOSE ¶ ¶ AND TWO EYES MADE OUT OF COAL ¶ ¶ FROSTY THE SNOWMAN IS A FAIRY TALE THEY SAY ¶ ¶ HE WAS MADE OF SNOW BUT THE CHILDREN KNOW ¶ ¶ THAT HE CAME TO LIFE ONE DAY ¶ ¶ THERE MUST'VE BEEN SOME MAGIC ¶ ¶ IN THAT OLD SILK HAT THEY FOUND ¶ ¶ FOR WHEN THEY PLACED IT ON HIS HEAD ¶ ¶ HE BEGAN TO DANCE AROUND ¶ ¶ FROSTY THE SNOWMAN WAS ALIVE AS HE COULD BE ¶ ¶ AND THE CHILDREN SAY HE COULD LAUGH AND PLAY ¶ ¶ JUST THE SAME AS YOU AND ME ¶ - [laughing] - IT IS SAID THAT FROSTY THE SNOWMAN ALWAYS GOES WHERE HE IS NEEDED MOST, AND RIGHT NOW, NO ONE NEEDS FROSTY MORE THAN A BOY NAMED TOMMY TINKERTON, IN A TOWN CALLED EVERGREEN. - [snoring] [door opens] - OKAY, BOYS, RISE AND SHINE. DAYLIGHT'S BURNING. THE EARLY BIRD CATCHES THE WORM. - THE WORM? OH, BOY! - DAD, I HAD THE STRANGEST DREAM LAST NIGHT. - NOT NOW, SPORT, OKAY? PUT SOME HOP IN YOUR HUSTLE. PUT SOME GREASE IN YOUR MUSCLE. YOU ARE GOING TO BE LATE. WHO'S GOING OUT FOR MORNING INSPECTION? - YOU ARE! - AND WHO'S GONNA BE DOWNSTAIRS IN EXACTLY 3.5 MINUTES, PROMPT, PRESENT AND PREPARED, HUH? - ME ARE! I MEAN, WE ARE. - [laughing] UGH! - CHECKAROONI. TIME WAITS FOR NO MAN. TICK TOCK, TINKERTONS. TICK TOCK. WAY TO SHINE, BIG GUY. THANKS FOR PLAYING BY THE RULES. [humming] MM MM MM! NOW THAT'S CLEAN STREET. MORNING MILK DELIVERED? CHECK. PAPER BOY EN ROUTE? CHECK. - HEY, GOOD MORNING, MR. MAYOR. - FLOWERS AND PERENNIALS IN A CONSTANT STATE OF BLOOM DESPITE FRIGID WEATHER CONDITIONS? COME ON, BUDDY. BE A TEAM PLAYER. ATTA BOY! [humming] [door opens] - TEETH NOT GUMS. TEETH NOT GUMS. - GOOD LOOKING. LOOKING GOOD. AT EASE, TINKERTONS. BREAKFAST EATEN? - CHECK. - DOG WALKED? - SIR, YES SIR! - HOMEWORK COMPLETE? both: YES SIR, DAD SIR! - YES, MR. TINKERTON HAD HIS FAMILY AND EVERY OTHER FAMILY IN EVERGREEN PLAYING BY HIS RULES. - CHIN UP AND SHOULDERS BACK. EYES STRAIGHT. STEADY GAIT. THAT IS ONE STRAIGHT LINE. - EYES FORWARD. GET THE LEAD OUT. - AND FOR THE MOST PART, THE CHILDREN OF EVERGREEN NEVER DID STEP OUT OF THAT LINE. UNLESS OF COURSE, BY ACCIDENT. - AND WE'RE WALKING. KEEP IT MOVING, PEOPLE. WHOA! OOF! - [gasps] [tires screeching] smash! - HUH? [shouting] thud! [groaning] - BUT IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT LIFE HAS TAUGHT ME, IT'S THAT THERE ARE NO ACCIDENTS. - HEY. HUH? - TOMMY, GET OVER HERE. KEEP IT MOVING, PEOPLE. LET'S KEEP IT GOING. - HEY, WALTER, AFTER SCHOOL-- - LET ME GUESS. YOU'RE GONNA GO TALK TO SARA SIMPLE? YOU SAY THAT EVERY DAY, TOMMY. - THIS TIME I MEAN IT. THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT TODAY. - MOVE IT. MOVE IT. MOVE IT. - THAT HAT, PRINCIPAL PANKLEY. I THINK IT'S FOLLOWING ME. - DO I LOOK LIKE A BABY? - NO SIR, PRINCIPAL PANKLEY, SIR. - DOES IT LOOK LIKE BEDTIME? - NO. - THEN WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME STORIES? GET INSIDE! - GOOD MORNING, CHILDREN. OUR HANDS ARE CLEAN AND NEATLY FOLDED BECAUSE... - BECAUSE WE ALWAYS FOLLOW THE RULES. EYES FORWARD, PUPILS. - NOW DURING TODAY'S LESSON, LET'S WORK ON CONCENTRATING ON OUR PERFECT, PERFECT, PERFECT LETTERING. [tapping] - LISTEN UP, SHORT STACK. IF YOU THINK YOU'RE ENTITLED TO SPECIAL PRIVILEGES JUST BECAUSE YOUR DAD IS THE MAYOR, THEN YOU ARE SADLY MISTAKEN. WHEN I SAY EYES FORWARD, I MEAN EYES FORWARD! - [gulps] [bell ringing] HI, SARA. SO THEY, UH, SWITCHED PENCILS ON US, DID YOU NOTICE? THEY USED TO USE THE NUMBER TWO, AND NOW THEY'RE USING THE NUMBER FOUR. BUT ME, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF NUMBER TWO. - YEAH, UH, MY MOTHER'S EXPECTING ME. - UH, OKAY. WELL, BYE. "THEY SWITCHED PENCILS ON US." WHAT AN IDIOT. - BUT I DON'T WANT TO STAY COOPED UP IN MY ROOM ALL DAY, MOTHER. I WANT TO GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY. - PLAYING IS OVERRATED. WHEN I WAS A GIRL, DO YOU KNOW WHAT MY FAVORITE AFTER-SCHOOL ACTIVITY WAS? HAVING MOTHER BRUSH MY HAIR. AND WITH LONG SWEEPING STROKES DO WE BRUSH. BRUSH! YOU SEE, SARA, EVERY GIRL IS A PRINCESS, AND HER HAIR IS HER CROWN. - BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE A PRINCESS. I WANT TO BE AN URBAN PLANNER. - I SWEAR YOU GET THIS FROM YOUR FATHER'S SIDE. buzz! [bell clanging] - QUESTION ONE. - YOUR SALAD AND SOUP COURSE ARE PRESENTED AT THE SAME TIME. - SET SALAD ASIDE, 3:00. USING SOUP SPOON, LARGEST ON THE TABLE, MOVE SOUP IN COUNTERCLOCKWISE MOTIONS TO COOL. NEVER BLOW, NEVER SLURP, NEVER SET SOILED SPOON ON TABLECLOTH. WAIT UNTIL OTHERS HAVE FINISHED BEFORE MOVING ON TO THE SALAD COURSE. - OOH, LOOK OUT. - QUEEN OF ENGLAND! - LINE ONE. - WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE FOR TEA. [laughing] - LOSER. - WHAT IS THAT? A BACKWARDS L? - YOU ARE. - HEY, HEY, HEY. SPORTSMANSHIP, BOYS. TOMMY CAN STILL REDEEM HIMSELF IN THE... both: BONUS ROUND! - WHICH FOODS ARE APPROPRIATE TO EAT WITH ONE'S FINGERS? - ARTICHOKES, ASPARAGUS, HORS D'OEUVRES, CRUDITE, CANAPES, COCKTAIL WIENERS, OLIVES, PICKLES, NUTS, DEVILED EGGS, CHIPS. - YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES. - WE HAVE A WINNER! NUMERO UNO. VICTORY LAP AROUND THE 'HOOD, WHAT DO YOU SAY? JUST YOU, ME, AND THE CLIPBOARD. - HA-HA, YEAH! - WHOO-HOO! - WOULD YOU LOOK AT HOW HE HAS THAT LITTLE CLIPBOARD ALL DRESSED UP FOR THE SNOW? IF THAT'S NOT THE CUTEST THING. - [groans] - OH, TOMMY, DON'T LET IT GET YOU DOWN. YOU'RE CAPABLE OF GREAT THINGS TOO. YOU'LL SEE. [shimmering] - YOU LOOKING FOR ME? I CAN'T. I ALREADY LET MY DAD DOWN ONCE TODAY. I JUST CAN'T. - AND SO FROSTY'S PATH TO TOMMY TINKERTON WOULD NOT BE STRAIGHT AND NARROW. THE PATH WOULD TWIST AND TURN. LEADING FROSTY TO THE HOME OF WALTER WADER, TOMMY'S FRIEND AND NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR. [knocking] - [gasps] WHO'S THERE? AHA! NO ANSWER. AND SO WHAT DO YOU DO NOW, WALTER? - UH, OPEN THE DOOR AND HIT 'EM WITH THE VEGETABLES? - THESE ARE NOT VEGETABLES, WALTER. THIS IS CORN. CORN IS A STARCH. - OPEN THE DOOR AND HIT 'EM WITH THE STARCH? - ABSOLUTELY NOT. - SO I DON'T OPEN THE DOOR AT ALL? - YOU DO NOT. - AND SO WHAT DO I DO WITH THE STARCH? - YOU PUT IT AWAY IN THE PANTRY. - I PUT IT AWAY IN THE PANTRY. - YOU CAN RINSE THOSE DINNER DISHES WHILE YOU'RE IN THERE, WALTER. - RINSE THE DINNER DISHES. - AND DON'T MAKE THE WATER TOO HOT, OR YOU'LL BURN YOURSELF, WALTER. - BURN MYSELF, WALTER. AND DON'T LET THE WATER RUN FULL BLAST, OR YOU'LL WET YOURSELF. - COLD WATER! OH, GOOD... OH, MESSY. OH, NO. I-I DIDN'T-- I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO-- WATER... OH. - WALTER WAS A NERVOUS BOY. SO WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED THAT WALTER WADER, WALTER THE WORRIER, WOULD BE THE FIRST ONE TO HEED FROSTY'S CALL? - [gasps] WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DO YOU WANT? [tapping] HOW ARE YOU DOING THIS? I DON'T SEE ANY STRINGS. WHOA! WHA! - WALTER, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? - I HAVE NO IDEA. I'M FLYING THROUGH THE NIGHT SKY WITHOUT A COAT. [laughter] THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. HAT? WHERE ARE YOU, HAT? I KNOW. - HAPPY BIRTHDAY. - BUT IT'S NOT MY BIRTHDAY. - THEN I GUESS WE'RE NOT TWINS, ARE WE? - TWINS? OF COURSE WE'RE NOT TWINS. I'M A PERSON AND YOU'RE A SNOWMAN. - A SNOWMAN? I AM? YOU'RE RIGHT, I AM! HEY, ANYONE EVER TEACH YOU THE RIGHT WAY TO MAKE A SNOWBALL? - AN ACTUAL SNOWBALL? LIKE ON TV? - THE KEY IS TO FIND SOME GOOD, WET SNOW, HEAP IT ON, DON'T BE STINGY, AND PACK IT TIGHT. - YOU'RE NOT GOING TO THROW THAT AT ME, ARE YOU? - OH, I DON'T KNOW. - BUT I'M NOT EVEN WEARING MY HELMET, AND MY MOTHER SAYS I CAN'T AFFORD ANOTHER HEAD INJURY. HEY! THAT DIDN'T EVEN HURT. [laughter] - READY? SET. SNOW! - WOW! - GO! - NO FAIR! YOU CHEATED! [laughter] - KNOCK, KNOCK. - WHO'S THERE? - ICE CREAM SODA. - ICE CREAM SODA WHO? - I SCREAM "SODA" WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD CAN HEAR ME! - SHH. WELL, I GUESS I'D BETTER HEAD INSIDE NOW. IT'S JUST THAT... I'M--I'M A LITTLE SCARED. - SCARED? SCARED OF WHAT? - MY MOTHER. - WHY? IS SHE COVERED IN HAIR? DOES SHE HAVE LONG FANGS OR TERRIBLE CLAWS? - NO, SHE'S JUST A LADY. - OH. JUST A LADY DOESN'T SOUND SO SCARY. - HELLO, MOTHER. - W-W-W-WALTER? WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS? I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN YOUR BED FAST ASLEEP. WHAT IN THE WORLD WERE YOU DOING OUT THERE? - I GUESS I WAS HAVING FUN. - AHH! - NEVER FALTER, WALTER. ONE DOWN. THE REST OF EVERGREEN TO GO. [indistinct conversation] - I HEARD HE WAS OUT AFTER DARK. - AND HE DIDN'T TELL HIS MOTHER. - AND HE WASN'T EVEN SORRY. - WALTER, WHAT WERE YOU DOING OUT THERE LAST NIGHT? - IT WAS AMAZING. I-- [bell ringing] I'LL TELL YOU AT LUNCH. - WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR, YOU MUST COME DOWN ON THIS BOY SWIFTLY AND WITHOUT MERCY. OTHERWISE, WE'LL BE LOOKING AT A MUTINY SITUATION. - OOH. MUTINY'S NOT GOOD. - NO SIR, IT ISN'T. - WE'RE IN A BIT OF A PICKLE, PANK. SURE, THE KID'S A GOOD EGG, BUT ONE SOUR GRAPE CAN SPOIL THE WHOLE ENCHILADA. WELL, AM I WRONG? WALTER WADER, PLEASE RISE. crash! [gasping] - CHEESE AND FRIES, I CAN'T WATCH. [screaming] POINTY, ISN'T IT? I'M SORRY TO HAVE TO DO THIS TO YOU, SON. NEXT TIME THIS BOY THINKS OF BREAKING CURFEW, I DARESAY HE'LL THINK TWICE. - THRICE! - OR THRICE, MAYBE. THERE ARE NO WINNERS HERE TODAY. - LET'S DIRECT OUR ATTENTION BACK TO THE BOARD, PLEASE. - WOW. - YES! - WALTER, YOU'VE GOT TO TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON. I SAW THAT HAT YESTERDAY AND-- - HEY, WADER. IF YOU DON'T SHAPE UP, I'M GOING TO SQUASH YOU LIKE A BUG. - BUT THAT'S NOT A BUG, CHARLIE. THAT'S CORN. CORN'S A STARCH. - THIS TIME IT WAS THE STARCH, BUT NEXT TIME IT'S GONNA BE YOUR FACE. SO I SUGGEST YOU WATCH YOUR BACK, WALTER. YOU WATCH YOUR BACK AND YOUR FRONT AND YOUR-- YOUR MIDDLE AREA, TOO. - IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN EVERGREEN HISTORY THAT THE DETENTION ROOM HAD BEEN USED. THEY HAD TO FIND A SPECIAL KEY JUST TO OPEN IT. crash! - NO! I'M SORRY, SON, BUT THIS IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. - GET READY TO TASTE THE CAP. - DAD? - TASTE IT. - I ONLY-- - FOOD FIGHTING IS A NO-NO, CHARLES. YOU KNOW BETTER. RULES ARE RULES. [sighs] AND I'LL NEED THE PIN BACK. - [gasps] NOT THE PIN. - YES, THE PIN. OH, DEFINITELY THE PIN. - GAH! THAT HURT ME MORE THAN IT HURT YOU, SON, BECAUSE I POKED MYSELF. RIGHT THERE, SEE? [muttering] NOW, WALTER. I'M GIVING YOU ONE LAST CHANCE TO MAKE NICE-NICE AND TELL OL' MR. TINK WHERE YOU WERE LAST NIGHT. - OH, PLAY BALL, WADER, AND WALK OUT OF HERE NOW WITH WHAT'S LEFT OF YOUR DIGNITY. - WELL, IF YOU REALLY MUST KNOW, I WAS PLAYING WITH A MAGICAL SNOWMAN. - M-M-MAGICAL SNOWMAN? - YEAH, YOU HEARD ME. - WAIT A MINUTE. IS IT MY IMAGINATION OR-- - IT IS MOST DEFINITELY YOUR IMAGINATION, SIR. MAGICAL SNOWMEN DO NOT EXIST. - NO? NO, OF COURSE THEY DON'T. WE'LL FETCH YOU BOYS BEFORE THE BUILDING CLOSES. - DID YOU SEE THE LOOKS ON THEIR FACES? THAT'LL PUT AN END TO THE NONSENSE. I GUARANTEE IT. SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO NOW? MID-DAY INSPECTION? LOOK FOR PARKING VIOLATIONS? SPIT SHINE THE CLIPBOARD? I'M UP FOR ANYTHING. - WOULD IF I COULD, HANKY PANKY, BUT I CAN'T, SO I WON'T. - TOMORROW'S ANOTHER DAY, SIR. TOMORROW IS INDEED ANOTHER DAY. - DUNCE CAPS? DETENTION? YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ON A DAY LIKE THAT STUDENTS WOULD RUSH HOME, JUST TO STAY OUT OF HARM'S WAY. BUT NO ONE DID. INSTEAD, THEY LINGERED. BREATHING IN THE UNMISTAKABLE SCENT OF MISCHIEF THAT HUNG IN THE AIR. - HUH? - WHOO-HOO! [laughing] WHEE! snap! WHO'S THERE? SHOW YOURSELF, COWARD! - [panting] - I THOUGHT NOT. - [sighs] - "COWARD." THE WORST PART IS, EVEN THOUGH SARA HAD NO IDEA WHO SHE WAS TALKING TO THAT DAY, TOMMY COULDN'T HELP BUT FEEL THAT SHE HAD CALLED IT JUST RIGHT. - OH. HELLO? WAIT. - MAGICAL SNOWMAN. YEAH, RIGHT. NO SUCH THING. - IS TOO. - IS NOT. - IS TOO. - IS NOT. - IS NOT. IS TOO-- IS NOT. - [laughing] - YOU THINK ANYONE IS GONNA BELIEVE YOUR STUPID STORY ABOUT A STUPID SNOWMAN? - I THINK THEY ALREADY BELIEVE IT. YOU EVER SEEN YOUR DAD THAT TONGUE-TIED BEFORE? HMM? - SHH! - EXCUSE ME, DID YOU SEE A-- - SHH! STOP! WHOA! WHOA. - I CAN'T BELIEVE HE TOOK MY PIN. - THAT'S NOTHING. HE TOLD THE LITTLE KID WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR TO ME THAT SANTA CLAUS DOESN'T EXIST. - SANTA CLAUS DOESN'T EXIST. - JUST LIKE MAGICAL SNOWMEN, RIGHT? - [humming] [laughter] LET'S GO. [laughter] HMM, I SEE WHAT YOU'RE GOING FOR, BUT HIS LOWER BODY LACKS STRUCTURE. - GUESS IT TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE. - YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT. WATCH ME WORK. - WOW! - I CALL IT "ME." - [laughs] I SEE THE RESEMBLANCE. - WELL, GOT TO GO. WALTER, CALL ME. - HUH, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE HAD A PHONE. - AH! WHAT IS THIS PLACE? WOW. AH! THE SECRET AND NEVER ENDING ADVENTURES OF FROSTY THE SNOWMAN? ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A BOY WHO DIDN'T BELIEVE IN MAGIC. IRONICALLY, HIS FATHER WAS A MAGICIAN. THE BOY BELIEVED THAT REAL MAGIC, THE STUFF YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN, DID NOT EXIST. AND THEN ONE DAY WHEN THE BOY WAS RUNNING AN ERRAND FOR HIS FATHER, SOMETHING AMAZING HAPPENED. - HAPPY BIRTHDAY! - THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME MAGIC IN FATHER'S HAT AFTER ALL. "UTTER NONSENSE," SAYS HIS FATHER. "THE BOY SHOULD KNOW BETTER. "MAGIC? TALKING SNOWMEN? IT'S AS FOOLISH AS FOOLISH CAN BE." THE BOY SPENT THE REST OF THE WINTER LOOKING FOR HIS FATHER'S HAT. LOOKING FOR PROOF THAT FROSTY THE SNOWMAN REALLY DID EXIST, BUT HE NEVER FOUND ANY. [shimmering] THAT'S IT? - PEARL, HAS THE NEW CLIPBOARD QUARTERLY ARRIVED? SURE COULD USE THE PICK-ME-UP. - HERE GO, MR. TINKERTON. OH, SAY, DID YOU SEE TOMMY? CAME IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO. AT LEAST I THINK THAT WAS HIM. [piano playing] ¶ ¶ - I CALL IT SARA SAYS. IN THE KEY OF "G." - REALLY, SARA. I CAN'T EVEN HEAR MYSELF THINK WITH THAT RACKET. YOU SHOULD BE PRACTICING YOUR SCALES. - BUT SCALES ARE SO REPETITIVE. - AND THAT'S THE POINT, SARA. THAT'S PRECISELY THE POINT. SCALES ARE THE FOUNDATION OF AN ACCOMPLISHED PIANIST. AND AN AIR OF ACCOMPLISHMENT IS WHAT MAKES A GIRL CAPTIVATING TO A SUITOR. HOW DO YOU THINK I CHARMED YOUR FATHER? - [snoring] - YOU CHARMED HIM RIGHT TO SLEEP. - WELL, DON'T BLAME ME. HE WAS LIKE THAT WHEN I FOUND HIM. MOTHER KNOWS BEST, SARA. YOU WILL SIT AT THIS PIANO UNTIL YOUR SCALES ARE PERFECT, AND SOME DAY YOU WILL THANK ME FOR THIS. - [sighs] - TOMMY? TOMCAT? NO SHAME IN GOING TO THE LIBRARY, SON. YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIDE YOUR LEARNING FROM ME. [sighs] OH! - YOU OKAY, DAD? - [chuckles] JUST A LITTLE ANTSY, I SUPPOSE. SOME OF THE KIDS HAVE BEEN GIVING YOUR OLD MAN AN AWFUL CASE OF THE GOOD GRIEFS. YOUR BROTHER'S ONE OF 'EM. FOOD FIGHTING, BREAKING CURFEW, AND NOW SOME NONSENSE ABOUT A MAGICAL SNOWMAN? JEEZ LOUISE. WHERE DID I GO WRONG? SEEMS LIKE EVERY KID IN TOWN IS BREAKING THE RULES. BUT NOT YOU, TOM-O. I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS PIN. YOU'RE NUMBER ONE NOW. - ME? - WHO ELSE? I WANT YOU TO BE MY EYES, MY EARS, MY NOSE, AND MY FEET. I'M COUNTING ON YOU TO TELL ME IF THERE IS ANY FUNNY BUSINESS WHATSOEVER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO IF I DIDN'T HAVE YOU, ALWAYS RIGHT THERE BESIDE ME, HELPING ME KEEP THINGS STRAIGHT. [sobs] - IT'S OKAY, DAD. - OH, I WAS TALKING TO THE CLIPBOARD, SON. - OH. - MY RULES MAY SEEM SILLY, BUT THEY'RE MADE TO PROTECT YOU. - PROTECT ME FROM WHAT? - DISAPPOINTMENT. DELUSION. SOME OTHER THINGS THAT START WITH "D." THINGS THAT START WITH "D" THAT YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND, SO JUST TRUST ME, TOM-TOM, AND BE A GOOD, GOOD RULE-FOLLOWER, HUH? WILL YOU DO THAT FOR ME? - YOU GOT IT, DAD. - ATTA BOY. LET'S HAVE A HUG. AWW, WHAT THE HECK, THE BOTH OF YOU. [tapping] - [gasps] - OOF! HELLO. - HELLO. YOU TALK. - SO DO YOU. I TALK ALL THE TIME, ACTUALLY, BUT NO ONE EVER SEEMS TO HEAR ME. - MAYBE YOU'RE TALKING TOO LOUDLY. - IS THAT RIGHT? - IN FACT, THE QUIETER I TALK... THE MORE ATTENTION YOU HAVE TO PAY JUST TO HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING. - WOW. YOU'RE RIGHT. - SHH! - [giggling] - SO, SARA, WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HAVE TO SAY? [whispering] - DEAR MISS BARKER-- - I AM NOT MY MOTHER. - WHAT'S THAT? I MUST BE TIRED. DEAR MISS BARKER, I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH-- - I DON'T LIKE TEA TIME. - WHAT. - I WANT TO PLAY MY OWN MUSIC. - WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS? - I DON'T LIKE HAVING LONG HAIR. - SARA, IS THAT YOU? - AND I'D LIKE TO LEARN TO ICE SKATE. IF YOU PLEASE. - ICE SKATE? ICE SKATE? I LOVE TO ICE SKATE! - WOW! - LET'S GO. [laughs] [laughter] - WHEE! WHOO-HOO! [laughing] - HEY, CHARLIE. I FOUND SOMETHING AMAZING AT THE LIBRARY TODAY. - WAS IT MY NUMBER ONE PIN? DAD'S NOT RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW. HE'S NOT RIGHT ABOUT MAGIC OR TALKING SNOWMEN, AND HE'S DEFINITELY NOT RIGHT ABOUT YOU BEING NUMBER ONE. - THE SECRET SOCIETY OF FROSTY THE SNOWMAN HAD STARTED TO FORM, BUT ITS MOST IMPORTANT MEMBER WAS STILL MISSING. [whispering] - THINK WE'LL EVER GET TO SEE HIM AGAIN? - I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE EACH KID ONLY GETS ONE CHANCE. WHAT DO YOU THINK, WALTER? - [clears throat] - SO DAD'S CAR GOT VANDALIZED, DID YOU HEAR? PRINCIPAL PANKLEY'S STILL LOOKING FOR THE ONE WHO DID IT. - UH, THIS IS A PRIVATE CONVERSATION. - SORRY, TOMMY. THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW. - YEAH, NOW THAT YOU'RE NUMBER ONE. - SURE, I GET IT. NO PROBLEM. HIS MAGIC POWERS COME FROM HIS TOP HAT. IT USED TO BELONG TO A MAGICIAN. JUST SO YOU KNOW. [door opens] - BOYS, IS THAT YOU? - JUST ME, MOM. - I'M IN THE FAMILY ROOM. NOTHING MISSING BUT THE FAMILY. - WHATCHA DOING? - SCRAPBOOKING. - HUH? MOM, WHO'S THIS? - WHY THAT'S YOUR FATHER WHEN HE WAS YOUR AGE. PLAYING WITH YOUR GRANDFATHER'S HAT. HE WAS A MAGICIAN, YOU KNOW? TOMMY? TOMMY? - DOING MY HOMEWORK. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. THE BOY IN THE COMIC... THAT'S MY DAD. - WAY TO SHINE, BIG GUY! FEEL THAT GOLDEN GLOW. GOSH, THAT'S WARM STUFF. WHAT THE MOUSE? 6:01? COME ON, BIG GUY, BE A TEAM PLAYER. THERE'S A SCHEDULE TO KEEP. [growls] YOU WILL RUE THE DAY-- SWEET CORN WITH DRAWN BUTTER. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT CAME FROM. NOW WHERE WERE WE? MORNING PAPER IN THE POST BOX? CHECKAROONI. SNOW DRIFTS SAFELY BELOW REGULATION HEIGHT? CHECK. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. NO! [crying] MY CAR? WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? AGH! - MUTINY, SIR. THE CALLS WON'T STOP COMING IN. CHILDREN AREN'T LISTENING TO THE RULES. THEY AREN'T LISTENING TO THEIR PARENTS. IN A NUTSHELL, IT'S MAYHEM. - BUT IF THE KIDS AREN'T LISTENING TO US, AND THEY'RE NOT LISTENING TO THEIR PARENTS. WHO ARE THEY LISTENING TO? - HERE, FROSTY. OVER HERE. IT'S YOUR OLD PAL, WALTER. CHOOSE ME. CHOOSE ME. - WALTER, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. - GO AWAY. NO, NO, NO. NOT YOU. COME BACK! WHAT DO YOU WANT? - I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. IT'S ABOUT FROSTY AND MY DAD. IT'S ABOUT THE WHOLE TOWN. - [grunting] OW! HEY, WATCH IT. - YOU WATCH IT. - WOULD YOU TWO CAN IT? [laughter] - YOU'RE FROSTY THE SNOWMAN. - I KNOW. AND YOU'RE SONNY, SULLY, AND SIMON SKLAREW. - HEY, YOU CAN TELL US APART. - WHAT ARE YOU BOYS DOING OUT HERE? - WE'RE TAKING OUT THE TRASH. - TAKING OUT THE TRASH? TAKING OUT THE TRASH? THAT'S A GREAT IDEA! WHY, I'LL BET THE TRASH HARDLY EVER GETS TO GO OUT. THINK ABOUT IT. TRASH, THIS IS EVERGREEN. EVERGREEN, THIS IS THE TRASH. WHOO-HOO! - WAIT UP, FROSTY. - THERE'S BEEN MORE TALK, SIR, OF THIS MAGICAL SNOWMAN. - BUT IT'S CRAZY TALK. THERE'S NO SUCH THING. IS THERE? - OF COURSE NOT, SIR, YOU KNOW THAT AND I KNOW THAT, BUT SOMETHING HAS CONVINCED OUR CHILDREN OTHERWISE. NOW THEY'RE STARTING TO QUESTION EVERYTHING THAT EVERGREEN STANDS FOR. - THEN WE MUST ACT SWIFTLY AND WITHOUT-- - SWIFTLY AND WITHOUT MERCY. I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. IT'S JUST THAT... - PLEASE, SPEAK FRANKLY, PANKLEY. - WELL, SIR, WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER SINCE WE WERE CHILDREN, AND I'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING BUT RESPECT FOR YOU, EXCEPT MAYBE GREAT RESPECT, BUT THESE DAYS... LOOK AT YOU SIR, YOU'RE A MESS. - I AM? - YOUR CAR'S BEEN VANDALIZED. THE GROUNDS ARE UNKEMPT. YOUR CHILDREN WON'T LISTEN TO YOU. DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU'RE STILL UP TO THE JOB? - FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME, MR. TINKERTON WASN'T SURE HE HAD THE ANSWER, AND WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS, WELL, THAT'S WHEN THERE'S ROOM FOR WONDERFUL THINGS TO HAPPEN. - THE LITTLE BOY IN THE STORY IS MY DAD. - HOW DO I KNOW YOU'RE NOT JUST SPYING ON ME? [laughter] FROSTY! - FROSTY! - CHARLIE? - WALTER, WAIT. THIS IS IMPORTANT. - SO IS THIS. FROSTY WAS MY PAL FIRST. - WHOO-HOO! [all shouting] - HEY, FROSTY, WAIT FOR ME. - HE'S BEEN LIKE THIS FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR NOW. NOTHING SEEMS TO SNAP HIM OUT OF IT. ¶ LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA ¶ ¶ LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA CLIPBOARD ¶ ¶ LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA ¶ ¶ LA, LA, LA, LA LITTLE CLIPPY, LA, LA ¶ NOTHING. - THAT USUALLY CRACKS HIM UP. - PANKLEY IS A GOOD MAN. HE'LL DO WONDERS WITH EVERGREEN. I'M SURE OF IT. - MOM, WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT? - OH, STOMACH CRAMP. WAIT UP, FROSTY! - SORRY. ¶ TRY, TRY AS HARD AS YOU CAN ¶ ¶ YOU CAN'T CATCH ME I'M FROSTY THE SNOW-- ¶ OOF! - MY CITY! IT'S RUINED. - YOU THINK SO? - THAT'S EVERGREEN THE WAY I SEE IT, OR THE WAY I'D WISH IT WAS IF WISHING WEREN'T AGAINST THE RULES. - THIS IS BEAUTIFUL, SARA, AND THE BEST PART IS, THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO COMPLETE YOUR VISION IS RIGHT HERE. - OH, FROSTY. - NO, LITERALLY. IT'S RIGHT HERE IN MY CHEST CAVITY. - OH. AND YOU KEEP YOUR DREAMS RIGHT THERE TOO, SARA. THAT'S THE SAFEST PLACE FOR THEM. NOW WHO WANTS TO CATCH SOME SNOW? [cheering] [rumbling] - GUYS? FROSTY? WHERE DID EVERYONE GO? LITTLE HELP HERE? [piano playing scales] - IT FELT LIKE A NEW DAY FOR THE CHILDREN OF EVERGREEN, BUT THE DARKEST HOUR OFTEN COMES DIRECTLY AFTER HAVING SEEN THE LIGHT. - [gasps] OH, NO! - MAN, I HATE FROLICKING. THAT SNOWMAN IS BACK, AND HE'S RUINING EVERYTHING. I GOT TO DO SOMETHING. - GOT SOME NEW FRIENDS, DO YOU? NO TIME LEFT FOR YOUR OLD PAL? - WHAT'S THAT? HARD BEING THE ODD MAN OUT, ISN'T IT? MAYBE YOU'D HAVE BETTER LUCK FINDING FROSTY IF YOU WAITED TILL DARK. YOU KNOW, WHEN HE WASN'T SO BUSY. - [sniffles] YOU MEAN, YOU KNOW ABOUT FROSTY? - SURE, NO BIGGIE. - WELL, WHAT ABOUT CURFEW? - YOU KNOW, I THINK WE CAN BEND THE RULES JUST THIS ONCE NOW. HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL EVEN CHAPERONE. DON'T THANK ME NOW. WHAT SAY WE MEET AT THE LAKE? 8:45 WORK FOR YOU? - MY DAUGHTER DIDN'T MAKE HER BED THIS MORNING. - MY BOYS SAID THE SNOWMAN MADE THEM SHIRK THEIR CHORES AND STEAL OUR GARBAGE. - MY DAUGHTER IS REFUSING PIANO. SHE ONLY WANTS TO GO ICE-SKATING WITH THE SNOW FELLOW. - THEY'RE BREAKING RULES! - TALKING BACK! - ACTING SILLY! - TELLING STORIES! - ALL ABOUT SOME SNOWMAN NAMED FROSTY! - ALL RIGHT! YAY! [laughter] - GOOD PEOPLE OF EVERGREEN, ON BEHALF OF MR. TINKERTON AND MYSELF, I ASSURE YOU MAGICAL SNOWMEN DO NOT EXIST. A CHILD'S IMAGINATION IS A DANGEROUS THING. ANY FUTURE BOUTS OF IMAGIN-ITIS WILL BE DEALT WITH SWIFTLY AND WITHOUT MERCY. AS OF TONIGHT, I WILL BE STEPPING IN FOR MR. TINKERTON IN MANAGING BOTH THE CRISIS SITUATION AND THE TOWN OF EVERGREEN. AND I ASSURE YOU, YOU WILL NEVER HEAR THE WORDS "FROSTY THE SNOWMAN" AGAIN. [cheers and applause] MR. TINKERTON, OLD FRIEND, YOUR CLIPBOARD PLEASE. - [whimpering] - THE BOY SPENT THE REST OF THE WINTER LOOKING FOR PROOF THAT FROSTY THE SNOWMAN REALLY DID EXIST, BUT HE NEVER FOUND ANY. I WISH THE REST OF THESE PAGES WEREN'T BLANK. AMAZING! BUT WHAT THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WAS THAT FROSTY WAS LOOKING FOR HIM TOO, BUT SOMEONE WHO WAS JEALOUS OF THE BOY HAD CAPTURED FROSTY'S HAT AND LOCKED IT AWAY. - [sinister laughter] - PRINCIPAL PANKLEY! BUT THE WIND HAS A WAY OF STIRRING THINGS UP. THE BOY WAS A MAN NOW, AND IF HE DID NOT FIND HIS WAY BACK TO FROSTY AND RESTORE HIS FAITH IN MAGIC, THE OTHERS WOULD TURN HIS WORLD INTO AN UGLY PLACE. WAIT A MINUTE... WALTER WADER? [knocking] - LIGHTS OUT, TOMMY. YOUR FATHER STILL MAKES THE RULES IN THIS HOUSE, AND IT'S LIGHTS OUT. - OKAY, MOM, SORRY. I CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN. - OOF! - [laughing] - THIS IS FUN, WALTER, BUT IT'S GETTING KIND OF LATE, ISN'T IT? - JUST A LITTLE LONGER? PLEASE? I WANT YOU TO TEACH ME HOW TO DO A FIGURE EIGHT LIKE SARA. - OKAY, I GUESS. YAY! [cracking] - FROSTY, NO! - TA-DA! AWW. - [crying] - [laughing] PLEASURE DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU, WADER. - YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT FROSTY BEING MELTED. - DO I LOOK LIKE A TISSUE? - NO. - THEN WHY ARE YOU CRYING ALL OVER ME? LOOK, YOU HAD YOUR LITTLE ONE-ON-ONE TIME WITH FROSTY, MANO A SNOW-MANO, AND IF YOU PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT, I'LL EVEN ALLOW YOU VISITATION. POWER SMILE? BETTER GET HOME TO BED, WALLY. YOU'RE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF EVERGREEN CURFEW. [laughing] - [sobbing] - GUESS YOU GOT YOUR BIG CHANCE TO SUCK UP TO DAD. - WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? - SOMEONE WHO KNEW HOW TO DESTROY FROSTY RATTED HIM OUT. "HIS MAGIC POWERS ARE IN HIS HAT, JUST SO YOU KNOW." - YOU THINK I DID THIS? - NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAD THE CHANCE, YOU NEVER HUNG OUT WITH HIM. - BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID. - OF FROSTY? - NO, I-- - [clears throat] PRINCIPAL PANKLEY... - AHEM. - OH, I'M SORRY, MAYOR PANKLEY-- - HEY. - OH. SORRY. MAYOR PRINCIPAL PANKLEY WILL NOW TAKE THE STAGE. ALL RISE. [sporadic applause] - THANK YOU, MS. SHARPEY, AND THANK YOU CHILDREN. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. IT IS A NEW DAY. AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW, MR. TINKERTON HAS PASSED THE CLIPBOARD TO ME. I AM NOW YOUR LEADER. RIGHT. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS, SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE THOUGHT THAT YOU SAW SOMETHING OR MET SOMEONE... - WHERE'S THE HAT? - WHAT? HE'S GONE, AND I KNOW YOU HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT, WALTER. - I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. - THE AGE OF PANKLEY IS UPON US. CHILDREN ARE TO FOLLOW THE RULES, PARENTS ARE TO ASK NO QUESTIONS, AND EVERGREEN SHALL DO ONLY WHAT PANKLEY SAYS. PANKLEY SAYS STAND UP. PANKLEY SAYS TOUCH YOUR HEADS. PANKLEY SAYS HOP ON ONE FOOT. HA-HA. NOW STOP. AHA! PANKLEY DIDN'T SAY TO STOP, DID HE? LET THAT BE A LESSON TO YOU. LET THAT BE A GOOD LESSON TO YOU ALL. [clanging] NOW PANKLEY SAYS GO BACK TO CLASS. - KIDS HAD BEEN GIVEN THEIR MARCHING ORDERS, AND THEY MARCHED. BUT THERE WAS ONE PERSON WHO REFUSED TO ACCEPT THINGS THE WAY THEY WERE, AND IT WAS FINALLY TIME FOR HIM TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. - WHAT IS THIS? - IT'S OUR FUTURE. - I FOUND THIS COMIC BOOK IN A SECRET ROOM UNDER THE LIBRARY. IT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING. - IS THAT DAD? - YUP. - AND PRINCIPAL PANKLEY? - IF WE DON'T GET FROSTY'S HAT BACK AND SNAP DAD OUT OF IT, THINGS ARE JUST GONNA KEEP GETTING WORSE.
