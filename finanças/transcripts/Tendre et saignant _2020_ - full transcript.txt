No "plus guest" and no Interlux back office. Charly? Paolo's shooting. Thanks, Claire. What else? THE BUTCHER'S DAUGHTER Charly? My article. Good investigative reporting. Touching, spot on. You cut out the whole investigation! Would you prefer cut or unpublished? Sid Kharish and Yves are waiting. I'm going. Enjoy lunch! He's in a great mood. Karysma's stocks are up. Why are your here? To see my daughter! Bad timing. Call first. Charly? You coming? Dad, my boss, Sid Kharish, Yves de la Closerie. Your daughter's the best. Like me, you cut yourself shaving. See you there. So long. Sorry to shame you. It shames me you think that. Can we sit for a minute? Listen, work is tough at the moment. Lunch tomorrow? Tomorrow I'm at the hospital. Minor surgery. I'm getting a stent. Minor? Yeah, like a minor heart attack. Why didn't you tell me? I just did. Come on... What hospital? St. Antoine. So he gives the baby to his apprentice butcher to go and weigh it. The apprentice comes back: "6 pounds". "You sure?" "Yes, 6 pounds... gutted and deboned!" 130 over 60. Sleep and you'll be fine. Hello. My daughter… Charly. Reassured now? Your dad's a character. I'll leave you. I spoke to your doctor. He said it went well. - How do you feel? - Come here. Look. - Remember? - What? It's the shop. So you recognize it. Just next door, the massage parlor. And here... - For sale! - So what? I always dreamed of a big butcher shop. Cash register at the end, free of drafts. Window displays in Cinemascope. When the old ladies sold to the Chinese without telling us, Mommy cried all night long. "Mommy" was your wife, not your mother. I always said "Mommy". What's your problem? - Nothing. - Don't try to… You can't expand. You have no money and this project… You gotta be young. And guess what: you're young! It would look great. Fleury Family Butchers, Father and Daughter. And it was… it was modern. Were your wiener jokes modern? To think Mom put up with all that. Leave Mommy alone, please. I'll leave you alone. You need to rest. - See you. - Wait! I'm working with a young guy who's great, full of ideas. - Meet him. He can explain better. - Dad. I saw the bank. Dad. I need 100,000 euros. I was checking in on you. Now I'm reassured. Later, Dad. Your mother was a saint! Carole, I'll skip tonight's thing. I'm really too exhausted. See you tomorrow, okay? Take care. Today's special. It's not for me. Okay… I'll take it then. What's the special? Visiting hours are over. I'm Martial. - And you? - Katia, but it's bedtime. You better get going. I'm off, boss. Talk tomorrow. Don't think of work or money. Enjoy your rest. I bet she's naked under her gown. What was that? It's louchebem, butcher slang. To keep secrets from customers. Not your thing? Beanies are always a bit weird. I meant the rabbit. No thanks, I'm full. - A decaf, please. - Right away. Oh I'm sorry. Evening. Shit! I have to run. What do I owe you? Just a sec. It's me. Disappointed? Actually I hit the… - May I? - It got sent. Something to drink? Excuse me? A vodka. Make that two. Doubles. Yakuza? Your finger. It's how Japanese mafia spot each other. Does it bother you? I think I find it sexy. You think? Yes, Carole? We'll decide after Fashion Week. They'll be more relaxed. She did the cover of Madame 3 weeks ago. We'll meet tomorrow and discuss it. Take care. You work in fashion. How clever. - What do you do? - Guess. I'll answer yes or no. "Yes", I drink. "No", you do. Fireman? Artist! No, well, sort of. Artisan. A clue: I'm heading to the Rungis market. Not a butcher, are you? - What if I were? - We'd stop here. - Problem with butchers? - I avoid them if I can. - Are you? - Nope! I'm not a butcher. No, I'm a… florist. Roses. Does it hurt? It's been ages, but it can flare up. - And now? - Fine. - And now? - Fine. You invented the food-truck, but were robbed of your idea, your truck, your wife. Then you met a great boss and became a florist. Yep, more or less. Religious? I avoid industrial pork if I can. My favorites. "What's the main ingredient of the Bellini?" - Prosecco. - Wrong. Champagne. It's Italian champagne. They're made with prosecco, not champagne. You don't like losing. Not when I've won. Got kids? Why? Want us to have one? Let's wait a bit. Sure. Butchers. What did they ever do to you? My father. You father did that? No, he's a butcher. Really? He didn't have a son and… after school, I found knives… More fun that Barbies. I wasn't bad. He pushed and pushed but one day I slipped. When my mom died, I was furious with him. Rather die than continue. I was doing it to please him and it became… a prison. So I studied for my mom. But my father, Fleury Butchers, Father and Daughter… Shit, sorry. No big deal. Fleury? Yes, you sell flowers and my dad has Fleury Butcher's. Funny. Sorry. My father. The butcher. All right. - You're… - Leaving. Rungis market. What is it these days? Aren't winter flowers imported? Tulips. Tulips, tulips… Tulips. They smell so… Tulips have no scent. Have a nice day. Hello, Charly, please. It's Martial. Charly, I have a Martial on the line. What's a martial? She's not here. Leave a number and… Put him on! Hey, it's Martial. I thought it'd be good to meet again. Not good, but… yes, good. I need to see you. You need to. If I have no choice, I'll manage. Not before 9 pm. - Same café as last time? - Great. See you. What's your number? Ladies and gents. Mrs. Delaisse! Hello. So what would you like, Mrs. Delaisse? Something to grill, for two. One last Marceline filet. He says I'm his mentor but he's the best. You bet. To make him happy, I'll go get it. See you tomorrow. I mean Monday. Write down who calls and put no one through. Except Kharish. And Carole. And Hedi. What's that thing? It makes your eyes… How silly. I'm so late… Almost done. See my latest version? Very good. You're harsh on Chouchou, but it's good. So we can send it? Remove every other adjective and send it. There are almost none! Still too many. Your dad's shop. There's an emergency. My dad had an accident? Your shop is nearby? Wait, listen to me. They couldn't do a thing. He just collapsed. Who are you? His daughter. Honey, I'm here. Why is he here? I was going to come clean. You're staying with him? I don't even know him! Who are you? I want you to know I loved your dad. I know things were tense. Never mention him. Never call me Charly! Never talk to me again! Beat it! Forget me. No more messages. You're a liar and a cheat! Now, as we say our last farewells to Jacques, one of his favorite songs. Of course I have other certainties and other habits And others than you have come Tender lips, naked hands Of course Of course I murmured their names I caressed their foreheads And shared their thrills But from adventure To adventure From train to train, from port to port Never again, I swear to you Could I forget your body But from adventure To adventure From train to train, from port to port I could not close my wound I still love you See you soon. Be strong. We're here. Charly, I have two helmets if you want. I'm in. I came by foot. Right. My deepest condolences. - Thank you. - You've forgotten me. Jean-François Dutreuil, "Jef". I knew you as a kid. Jacques and I sowed our wild oats together. Is there a problem? We'll talk tomorrow. No, let's talk now. Jean-Pierre Pellegrin. Interlux. The Chouchou article was you? - Why is it a problem? - The problem... Behind the label: 21st-century slavery. "In May, Chouchou got caught in Bangladesh. "An undeclared subcontractor there "employed children in disgraceful conditions." That's not disgraceful? Yeah, yeah it is. Interlux is buying Chouchou. They just signed. Furious, Pellegrin called Kharish who called me. Take a look at this. "Karysma is temporarily replacing Chiffon's Charly Fleury, reassigned to work on internal communications strategies." In short, you're fired. We're talking! What do we do tomorrow? Do we open? Given the fact that my father didn't prepare for this, our only choice is to liquidate. Trim this into a lamb roast. - Martial! - What? Nothing to say? So who inherits? No one. - What about us? - And the shop? - I get it. - So do we open? No, I just told you. It's over. We open! That lady's waiting. Today we work for Jacques. Hurry! I want a word with you. I want one with you too! Cool, two words. - What the hell? - It's my only option. An option you'll regret forever. - Butcher-shrink: original! - Snob journalist: unoriginal! Not a snob, no longer a journalist, just keeping afloat. You float, we sink. Butchers can find work faster than me! I hope so. We get less severance than the editor of Chiffon. What is it, Chiffoon or Chiffon? Is it moroon or moron? Listen… getting fired at the funeral was a sign. Soon you'll be back in your bubble and I'll have a new job. But let's respect Jacques now! We owe him one last Christmas. Sorry, Martial. Why close 3 weeks before Christmas with orders galore? She has 50 friends on the way! It's like burning Chanels and Louboutins. - Get it? - I know Cornish hens, asshole. I grew up here. I don't want to come back. Get it? Me, an asshole? It's pronounced "moron". French Butchery Charly Fleury breaks all the records In my absence, a half glass a week Martial? One more word with you? José? Can you help the lady? Have a nice day. What do you need? A little time. We work the holidays. Sell the stock, find everyone jobs. And shut down on January 1st. Be right back. Stay away. Seems I'm contagious. Stop it. Fuck them. It's good that you came. You mustn't be sad. Stay sexy, chic, mysterious. Here comes Pellegrin. Fired by a guy who dresses like a car salesman. How tacky. Yes, Martial. I can't talk now. What's Torchin? No other breeders? Ah! Jean-Pierre! Wait… I have to go. How are you? Can we get a picture? I need to work. I'm hanging up. You know him. He's like that. Our end-of-the-year issue came out. We'll do an issue without you and it'll be over. I'll keep your chair warm. Good evening. - It didn't work out? - Not really. What's their gripe? That I did my job with a minimum of conviction and integrity. Your father: "My daughter, sharp as a knife. "A blade, intransigent, precise. "And…" And? He admired you. You scared him too. - Stop staring. - At what? - My legs! - They make me cold! - That's why? - Yeah, here. Thanks. Better? …to adventure From train to train From port to port I swear I never could forget your… "Never again, I swear to you". - What? - Not "I swear I"… Never again, I swear to you. Could I forget your body I still love you - Your shoe size? - 5. 11. It should do. I got an offer. With Jacques dead, I need to think about the future. I ordered those hens 9 months ago, remember? Jacques ordered them. I came to see you the first time. You're not the boss. And she won't… What do I tell customers? "Torchin bailed. Find a solution. Forget Christmas Eve." Sorry, Martial. Sorry? Let's beat it. Goodbye, miss. Asshole. - That's it? - What? 200 miles for that? No fowl. Lucky you, we close shop early. He's right. Jacques is gone. What's the point? Tons of followers. One click and you die. So honor your commitments or I'll post pics of your hens saying they're less tasty and juicy than cheap supermarket ones. Do as you please. I have no choice. I sold them right and left. - Serious buyers. - I don't look serious? Okay, we'll take them all. Every single one. Fleury Butcher's stands by its customers. Twice as many arrive next week. Hope you're hungry. The damages. Where do I put this? Yep. Now we have to sell them. Raise your chin. Less. Smile. Less. Turn to the right. Toward the duck on the right. Perfect, now freeze. - So... - Done? Hashtag... BestFowlEver. #FedWith25WildPlants. #MartialToussaint. #SexyButcher. #DoYouMeanIt? #GetBackToWork. #WannaTryAgain? Fleury Butcher's, hello? Martial, for you. Hello? Yes, ma'am. Your husband found cheaper online? It's not the same. What does he drive? It is pertinent. Skodas aren't Mercedes. She hung up. One less order. One more turkey. She's crazy! Hello, ma'am. Welcome to the Comptoir d'Amestoy. Can I take that? Thanks. I have an idea for the February issue. I think you'll like it. But I need your help. Pellegrin on the cover. 8-page interview with Despentes. Photos by Inez and Vinoodh. He'll agree. He's smart and narcissistic. Kharish will see he can't toss me out. I need to see them both together. Only you can swing that. Charly, you know Irina? Irina Popova? - What's the connection? - You'll see. - A militant vegan, so? - She's dating Quetsche. - Quetsche? - Pellegrin's daughter. Anyway, she saw the pics of your butcher with dead birds on your Instagram. She called Quetsche, who called Daddy, who called Kharish, who called me. Smells like trouble. Kharish isn't into meat, but now… Now what? You won't get your job back. Make peace with yourself, Charly. I'll help you. I'm here. Your fowl looks delicious. Vanessa dying for some. Save us one for the 24th? She sends her love. What you doing for New Year's? Vanessa will be skiing with the kids. We can celebrate together at home. We'll talk. We'll bounce back. Bounce back on what? Vanessa's bed? Keep pouring. Perfect. Check, please. It's on me. You can go. Great vintage. Too bad. I'll finish it, don't worry. You only see pretty women throw wine at the movies. Enjoy it? It's on me. Charlotte Fleury. Thanks. Who did you call before I showed up? 100 or 180 grams? What's wrong? I took another job. I was afraid to end up unemployed. I had no idea that… And I start tomorrow! I love this place. Jacques was so nice! But Jacques is gone and I'm a lot less nice. And we close in two weeks, so no regrets. Chin up, no more tears. - Come on, Brandon! - Sorry, boss. Don't bother. Get back to work. Sorry. Next… that'll be 24.90 euros. The new cashier is pretty! Stop, she's driving me crazy! If sales keep up, we'll close early. Last cow I had your dad buy. From Salers. Aged 6 weeks. You gotta taste it. "Eating steak rare represents both a nature and a morality." I didn't say that. Roland Barthez. Barthes. Yeah. And so? And so you didn't eat it, you didn't taste it. You swallowed it. Like cheese cubes. - Here. - No thanks. I wanted to close up, but the shutters got stuck. It happens. I'll do it. I'll find a cashier. I'll ask a friend. Think I can't do it? No but we open at 7. And it's not heated. My mother did it for 30 years. I think I can manage for 2 weeks. Bring a parka. Holy cow! Gorgeous, huh? 10-pound Birkin bag! 8-pound Bresse chicken for 6. Thermostat 6. 90 minutes. 200 grams of terrine for Mrs. Cambier. Hello? Fleury Butcher's. Whose order is this? 10 o'clock as promised. With stuffing? Go on, it's a beauty. Merry Christmas. - Here, José. - Thanks, boss. - All good? - Great look. Merry Christmas! Here you go, boss. Yes, it's the tradition. It suits you. You're pretty. Good luck. Stuffed Cornish hen for 6. I asked for no stuffing. No stuffing? Just a sec… you're right. Bye. Take care. I'll deal with this. Mr. Rossini's hen was without stuffing! José, careful with the orders! I can't read the boss' scrawl! So ask! If you can't read it, ask! Or ask Santa for new reading glasses. And I'm not the boss. Next. We grossed 26,000. We rocked. You did good. And I think we can pay Torchin. You did good too. It takes two. Like your dad said: "For every butcher, a butcheress" "Think pink, but don't wear it." That was Karl Lagerfeld. I have nothing for you. A pig? Or a sow. The cow I found was ugly. - Don't like it? - I do, a lot. Just a sec. You left a… For my sister. Christmas dinner. The girl who stopped by earlier? That was Julia, my ex. Okay. Mind if I leave? Go on, I'll close. And Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Got any plans? I don't see her often. Christmas is sacred. She married a real pain, but I like him. Family's family. They have 3 ball-buster kids, but I love them. Once a year? I hope you're up to it. Christmas carols, Yule log… Leave when you feel like it. I can't. I can't go. I forgot, I have a… I have a party. I'm sorry. Your party's here. - It's just too much. - Too much what? It's not that. It's just… I usually avoid Christmas if I can. But the brasserie, garlands, family… too much for me. Come on, we're hungry! Hello. Hello. Introduce me! No, not now. She's leaving. Christmas with Karl Lagerfeld. Didn't he die? When the customer opens it, I want the logo to be seen first. Hello, Fleury Butcher's. Yes, I'll ask him. Can Mr. Heller's filet feed 3 more? We served him well. Thank you, José. It'll be fine, sir. Jacques would be surprised seeing you here. Jef… Dutreuil. We need to talk. Your dad was a brother. A real pro. The Sirloin King. You used to come for Sunday lunch. Clutching Daddy's hand. With your pigtails and socks. He visited me after the hospital. It meant a lot to him. 100,000 is a lot. Did you know? You must be "the future". Out to revolutionize the job? No, just do it well. Fine with me. If Charly agrees, we can rip that up and get to work. Where we all belong. We can even keep the name. "Fleury" works for me. But Dutreuil-style? - You need a boss. - Not your kind. Animals on steroids, filthy slaughterhouses. High-priced German scraps. Meat merchants, not butchers. Death of the profession. Death of the profession. Little snots like you kill the trade. Go back to work. I'll think it over. Perfect timing. Tomorrow's a holiday. Call me on January 2nd. We said after the holidays. It's the only way to stay open. Got 100,000 to reimburse that fat pig? You don't get it. See this red flesh? These beautiful animals didn't die for nothing. That's why it's worth fighting! He's not a pig. Pigs are beautiful. Excellent fat, beautiful snouts. Look at you. Tense. You swallow without savoring. You've forgotten your roots! I'm going. Jacques' favorite carving knife. He gave it to me. All good? Enjoy yourselves. Is it done, Miguel? Want to taste? Here, taste this. To die for. Here you are. Having fun? A lot. No, Martial! You're not well. Why stop if you like it? No, it's ridiculous. It's not… No, it's not ridiculous. It's full of life! Look around. Are you into anyone here? No! You and Butcher Boy are living Fifty Shades of Red. And that… - Hitting on me? - No, it'd be too complicated. I don't get it. Are you a fashion editor or a butcher? Carole says you gave her that amazing meat. I need meat like that to put a simple steak and fries on my menu. It's my father, not me. Well, it was, but it's over. My father died. It was a guy who worked with my father but it's over with him too. But who cares? We won't talk about steak with an hour till the new year. "Steak is the heart of meat. Meat in its purest form. Whoever eats it assimilates its bull-like strength." Roland Barthes. Not Barthez? Will you throw wine at me if I propose to share our first breakfast of the year in bed? For breakfast, we'll see in a year. But for the steak and fries, I'll think it over. I want you to meet someone. I know you're upset, but… call me. Something weird to tell you. I'll reimburse Dutreuil with my severance pay and we'll both start from scratch. Chefs, fancy restaurants: we become their suppliers. Don't forget I'm an artisan. A neighborhood butcher. Didier, two champagnes! Exactly, but the same product for Michelin restaurants and old ladies. I'll do PR, that's my thing. You and I can do something good. Something really good. Together. If you agree. If you still want to. Of course I agree. Happy New Year! Happy New Year, my love! Hello! Charly, Julia… Happy New Year, Charly! I'll get us some drinks! We open on the 2nd. Happy New Year. Skirt steak, sirloin, rib-eye, aged 40 and 55 days. No skirt steak. Just rib-eye and sirloin. Fine. Clos de la Mouchère. Henri Boillot 2016. - Thanks. - To die for. - I haven't given up. - On what? Having you try my breakfast. Unless… Proud suppliers of Le Comptoir d'Amestoy Good job. They're mostly females. Cornish hen in front. It's not as pretty. It's more graphic. No, in my opinion it's not… What's this? Can't be more royalist than the king. Fuck the king. My cows are princesses. They eat grass, not silage. Let's go. Like it? No! But it's great! Anyway, I'm right. - I know. - Yeah, I'm the boss! So those are fake cows. Pretty, isn't it? You can say "Look", but I decide if it's pretty. Look! Now decide. Oh, how pretty! Charly, Jacques' daughter. Marcelin, son of Marcelin. Father of these beauties. Strong handshake like her dad's. She's gorgeous. I like her. This one too. Nice and fat. Good texture. I want those two. Her and her. You want them? Found his little lady and got a big head. She's my boss, not my little lady. - I had no idea. - I see that. This gives the taste. This is our secret. They think you're a bouquet. Selected by Martial Toussaint Don't move. You look great. This is perfect. You're bothering me! Gagnaire: 5 sweetbreads, blood pudding and 20 flank steaks for staff. Got it, boss. Everyone? Thank you! Brandon, reflex! How are you? Yes. Martial? The chef at the Georges V. Give me the veal rump we just got in. Brandon, we need some string too. Sure thing. Morning, boss! Come on! Closed for work Back in September! Martial, there's something I don't get. The refrigerator door is too wide. Mommy and Daddy say Martial Toussaint is the best butcher in Paris! Hey, a selfie? Smile because I am. We're late! Julia would like you to come to dinner with her friends. You wouldn't like it? Yes, but… Julia's friends… You may freak out if one has a bowtie with short sleeves. It's true, that would be a major lack of taste. For you, they're hicks. That's how you see me? No, that's how you are. It's why I shouldn't come? I don't get it. Then I don't get it. Subtitles, please. Explain, Charly. So are you coming? No, I'm seeing Carole. Too bad! Okay, let's go. We'll discuss this later? Discuss what? It's… a breeder. - Who doesn't get it. - Exactly. How can you deal with breeders? Okay, so long! Bye. Anyone here? No… we're closed. Oh, it's you. Carole reserved for dinner. Carole reserved the only night we're closed? She even confirmed by text an hour ago. Okay, well, you're here. We'll… figure something out. No, I'll go. No. Come. I'm glad you're here. What's this? It's… my last ditch effort. Hello. Hi. Croissants. I didn't sleep much. I've thought things over and here I am. Martial… Listening to… Carmen. Can I come in? I need to talk. It's not easy here. Martial… It's ready! Amestoy's truffled bacon must be eaten hot, hot, hot! I look stupid. No. Yes, yes. Bye, Charly. I'll keep them. How dumb are you? You're a butcher. She avoids butchers if she can. You're clueless. The Beefy Butcher Martial Toussaint, we're getting to know you. The star of butcher's and the butcher of stars. Behind you, there's a woman. Your partner. My boss. So tell us. How do you go from local butcher's to a veritable start-up in food service? We recently expanded our premises. The shop, the meat bar, our offices and our online sales. We can call it a success. In one year we've doubled our revenues. Not to mention the chefs you supply who total 22 Michelin stars! And the clients who trust us. Our 10 breeders work exclusively with us. Our slaughterhouse respects the highest standards. The animals are well fed, well slaughtered and well aged. - It's simple. - And… well selected by Martial, who's gifted. Charly Fleury, you've applied to butchery what you learned in fashion. But you, Martial, with all this activity, are you still a butcher? I get to the shop at 7 am. Actually, at 6. So yes, I think I'm still a butcher. They need you in the shop. Before refrigerators, the fat conserved the meat. Happy New Year. Already? My customers like to see me on New Year's Eve. - See you at my place? - I'll call you afterwards. See you next year. - What you staring at? - Nothing. Martial is lots of things, but not "nothing". Damn! Carole went all out! Got a technical term for that? Full treatment for Pellegrin. He's not the one who fired you? - Yes. - And he's here. The wheel of fortune turns. He wants to invest. Asian market, develop our quality label, what we always said. He's not just buying Martial's face? Martial Toussaint, 30 by 50 feet on his department stores? We have time to work that out. Tonight, all I want is to savor my revenge. Come, Jean-Pierre just told me something hilarious. Just a sec. Seen Charly? Working? Thinking. About what? If we say yes, everything will change. Pellegrin, Interlux, it's huge. World-wide distribution. It's boundless. That means lots of livestock. - Remember… - We're artisans. We must remain coolheaded and strong vis-à-vis Pellegrin. And united. We are united, aren't we? Partners. Sort of asking my hand in marriage? Sort of. So I can't say no. I don't know… Fifty? Fifty. May I? Yes. You chose the wrong profession! That feels so good! You know, in Japan, they massage their cows for hours. So now I'm a cow? A sacred cow. Yeah, there. What are you up to? Working. Me too. Pellegrin is leaving. He's looking for you. How do you do it? How do you do it? You're perfect. I'd like to be you. That's my New Year's resolution. To be you! He thinks I'm stupid and blind, but I'm not. There's nothing to see. We work. It's just work. We spend time together. We share lots of stuff. We're building up a business, but… Don't bother. I saw his computer. Two tickets to Bilbao next weekend. We're not going to Bilbao, but to the Beef-Fest in Aurillac. That's how I found out. What do you mean? Stop protecting your friend. It pisses me off and it's useless. My friend? Carole! He's screwing Carole? That whore! I didn't think you wanted him! Sorry! Do you know Bilbao? No. This isn't a mall. Take that all down. Charly! Use the other entrance! The key broke in the lock! Guys, salt the sidewalk. The customers will slip. I was on the radio. I talked about you. Cool! You okay? It's freezing. Something wrong? Julia told you. I meant to tell you. But we keep our private lives private. What do I care if you fuck Carole in Bilbao or anywhere else for that matter? You may not know it, but Carole's sex life is… Snow White and the 7 Dwarves. What's this? My expenses. What's the problem? Your expenses? How dumb do I look? - Ma'am, how are you? - Blood pudding, please. No time with the lêtefèmes. - The what? - The holidays. Sorry, ma'am. Find the time. Go in back and make blood pudding. Théo… be nice. Théo is working. No, he's screwing up. All those nerves will lose us customers. I can't hear you. Look at me when you talk. - He told me… - To screw up? - So he taught you wrong? - He didn't say that. What then? Why do our customers pay more while others go bankrupt? Okay, boss. You're being harsh. I agree with the lady. That's how you learn. It's how I did. You don't have to buy from me. You're nicer on TV. I agree with the lady! - Bye. - Have a nice day. Snow White beats the Snow Queen. Pack up. You're no longer needed. Yesterday we're partners and today I'm fired? You're exactly right. Take your apron and knives and leave. It's over. Don't cut yourself, Charly. Been there, done that. To work! What can I get for you? The boss, please. You're looking at her. Two rump steaks, please. We'll prepare that. How's that? Yes, perfect. Martial Toussaint signs with Interlux. Tell me what you think. How was it? - Amazing. - Delicious. - How's the kid? - Great. - See you, Charly. - Have a nice day. Plenty for three. Fleury Butchers, Father and Daughter Mrs. Delaisse, what can I get you? I'll wait for Charly. She knows what I like. Be right with you. Martial's Meat Stands Galeries Interlux - How many customers yesterday? - Only 5. Big problem. Our four Marcelines never showed up. - What about the others? - Same thing. Torchin? - Chateaubriand. - What do they want? To leave us. Third restaurant today with the Plaza. We'll think. We'll find a solution. Rungis market, tomorrow at 5? Got a breakfast date? It's Martial. He offered me twice as much. I retire in three years. I'm sorry, Charly. Okay. Check her out. Early riser! This is our best stuff. Depends what you're looking for. But it's all good meat. Martial Toussaint didn't invent the trade. You don't understand. I don't want just "good meat". I want haute couture. So follow me. Get ready! Rubia Galaga de Jose Luis Sanchez. Better than any wagyu. 12 years grazing, 12-month finish 12 weeks aged. How much? This is… Because of my shoes? - Excuse me? - My hairdo, maybe? Or just because I'm not a man? We can discuss… Don't get upset! Look at me. Straight ahead. Frontal, frontal. Deeper, look right at me. More frontal. Very good. Lift up your head. I'll take a look. I think we got it. I liked him as a bad boy. I prefer as a cowboy. He's a butcher. We need meat, knives, all out! Sorry but, isn't the meat on my dick too… - Too what? - Meat on meat. Don't ask me. I like both. We have it. Let's try again for fun. We'll try different positions. Different poses. We see the male, the tenderness. Love it. - What? - What the hell? How about coffee? Can you wait? What's the message? "Eat my meat and become hung like me?" I don't think that's it. Or else… "I strip for the Big Boss but hide my lack of balls." Using my image to sell my passion was your idea. I don't think so. Not to see you become Pellegrin's unprincipled lapdog. Know what their investment means to a guy like me? They trust me. Give me a bathrobe! You trust them? Are you stupid or just pretending? Pretending what? Today they say yes to everything. Tomorrow you can't say no. Everyone plays the game! Everyone wins! Like stopping our breeders from selling to me? Our breeders? I found them on my own. There are others. Go and find them. It took me years. Good luck and get to work. Maybe it's not my job, you're right. But it's no longer yours either. It sucks. Goodbye. It sucks because you ruined it all. The two of us worked well. We were good together. We were never together. Let's finish this crap. Get moving… Clarisse, go on. Back in the mood! Majestic Martial Toussaint Found a big fish for your butcher shop! Figuratively. I cancelled an appointment. He's coming now. We'll sell it. We'll sell it well. Good. He fell in love. He's not here yet? Nope. Is that your Smart? You forgot something. I have the keys to next door. Here. Keep it. I can't take it in the plane. Leaving? Chiffon is opening an Istanbul office. They asked me to run it. Take good care of it. Little water, once a week. What an ass. I offered him a drink and still got a ticket! What's he up to? "I'm in a rush. It's now or never!" Asshole! I'm calling him. Hello, sir. It's Mrs. Keller from the agency. Maybe we misunderstood each other. I'm in the gorgeous shop you fell in love with. I'll wait a few minutes more. Or call me back if you're still interested. Yes. I'm still interested. It's you! Please don't go. Call me back. You have my number. Here's my card. Fifty? Not a butcher, are you? Got a problem with butchers? I avoid them if I can. This time I can't. Fifty. Got it all ready? Pork chop, sirloin, filet. Pork chop, sirloin, filet. Mrs. Delaisse!
