chance who are you working with speak up who you're working with all right meeker joe mickeray was he in with you when a similar forgery took place in my other bank 15 years ago wait was your partner

i did what i thought was right at the time yeah quite so but he swore to kill you declaring him after all of these years is not going to soften him any i'm going to turn you over to the sheriff right now and if that gets out it'll go very bad with the bank very bad and you know that have you ever thought of the effect that it might have on betty lou you know it's worth considering jason she's become very attached to you it might not set so well with her to discover that a real father is a convict ex-convict i think you mean i've arranged for jim douglas parole he's on his way here jim

that hold me dead dead take betty lou to your place all your touches come on duck started to talk about i wondered myself i never heard him mention him before say sheriff how come you're holding this fella why clem heard him threaten hopkins just before the shooting i tell you sheriff i didn't kill him who are you anyway oh what's the difference let's talk to this other bird all right fella how about you i said talk it's cold as a macro where's knifed in the back maybe somebody was afraid he'd talk yeah but who i'm going to stay till i find out maybe i better turn another fella loose yeah it looks like you can go but you can thank red rider for it mister i guess i didn't get your name no i didn't give it don't know how to thank you ryder for saving my neck i'm glad you don't because no thanks are necessary so hopkins didn't tell you why he had me paroled jason had his own reason for doing things you ought to know that jim yes but i have a funny feeling something he wanted to tell me that was pretty important that's the reason he was killed no we'll never know will we what are your plans jim oh i don't know stick around here for a while i guess thinking of betty lou you gonna tell her who you are and ruin her life i'd rather be hung than have that happen to her you're absolutely right jim you'd like to be nearer wouldn't you give him a right arm we need a bank guard how'd you like to take the job uh mr johnson johnson it is i'll take it hello ryder how are you rid oh how's miss betty feeling well she's getting along fine you seem to be very concerned is she a friend of yours well no as a matter of fact i i just found out that mr johnson was an old friend of hopkins oh is that so well you uh you didn't mention it the other day you didn't ask me besides nobody would believe me well i'll have to be getting along mr kobe i know i report for the job tomorrow morning at nine thanks alrighty bye what job is that by a bank guard i figured we owed him something and decides he needs it well if you think it's all right i i guess betty lou will oh by the way red were you at the reading of the hopkins will yes we just read it what did it say it appoints the duchess and me as joint executors well what about the bank will you carry on or sell sell what for well with hopkins gone i i didn't think the girl would want to take on the responsibility oh but betty lou does oh by the way colby you'll have a job to do yeah what is it we'd like to have a complete financial statement by next monday morning it'll be a lot of work but we'll manage somehow thanks so long i didn't expect them to ask for that statement so soon what about the dummy bombs now don't get in a panic colby i told you the secret of success is to get a specialist for every job in this case you're the specialist simply remove the dummy bonds and say the bank is fifty thousand short i'm just to say that hopkins took them yes but fifty thousand dollars talking won't get it back what's your suggestion colby well there's two courses suspend operations or reorganize you mean let the bank fall into other hands i'll never let the bank go now you two are the executives of my dad's will and i want every cent that he left me put in this bank betty lou that's wonderful your dad would have been proud of you i'll kick in with my own money too how about you duchess yes sorry we'll keep hopkins name on this bank of buster got it oh wonderful oh not that no i'll bless you both come on let's go see about it right now oh hello feeling better than a few minutes ago mr johnson i'm very glad you're with us i felt sort of badly about accusing you the other day oh you've no cost to miss betty well if there's anything i can do to help please don't hesitate to ask me thank you coming duchess goodbye mr johnson goodbye look i see nothing funny in the situation our only chance to avoid ultimate exposure is to secure control of the bank now you got me into this thing you suggest a way out all right my dear colby i will suggest a way out a perfectly logical and legal way just a moment there's plenty of money for everybody don't get excited folks listen to me you're getting yourselves all worked up by a lot of idol rumors the bank solvent has money for all of you and why don't you pay it out but we're doing it as fast as we can just give us time right out of the last bill there'll be no holding him we'd better give it up we're not doing any such thing pay them in nickels and pennies and count slow they're doing a good job this amiga first rate check but they're stalling for time this is saturday early closing get in there and blow the lid off it's almost 12 and the bank is closing you folks come back monday go ahead and close up now wait just a minute sorry just a minute you may be able to run around knocking men down but you can't keep a poor defenseless woman from getting her money but madam and don't call me madam you bruiser i want my money well now just a minute lady i'm a peaceable man and you can have your money well i should think so just step right up there to the window i want my money what happened i don't know nobody freddy kitty so you brought him

what we'd have done without you and your scott friend little beaver oh no friend that's enough little beaver you don't want to get too clean there's a towel boy better put this blanket on oh and i i want to thank you too mr johnson for tackling that man it took some courage not me miss betty red rider did all that oh i don't know that's a matter of opinion oh by the way we're arranging to have some money expressed in mr johnson and we'd like to have you stay pretty close to the bank the sheriff will let us have a deputy to work with you oh sure thing you know i think that's a very good idea you know that run on the bank was staged i'm sure of it and i have an idea it ties in with other things that have happened around here me god thank you sorry beaver no can do this time oh just a minute red why can't our young friend here act as our mounted messenger sure we do our same pony express all right can do say what you do with little beaver but looks like he broke loose red i hope nothing's happened to the boy well i better go search for him this branch should leave quite a trail you better check the bank that's where he was last headed i'll leave right away he's coming now you get up there and do like we told you you savvy me and if you try any tricks i'll spice your ears off you savvy that me savvy that too okay then get up on that rock start the wave oh red let him have it as soon as his head shows over that rock i got a slug made order for there he is by golly i snagged him not so fast slim he's mighty tricky yeah you're right we'll take it easy you go around this way let's not take any chances there's his hat yeah but his head ain't in it you all right little beaver me much all right good thanks for that snake signal it saved my neck me glenn red you don't think anything happened to little beaver oh no what i've heard about that little indian boy he can take care of himself and with writer checking up on him you've got nothing to worry about that must be that sheriff's deputy coming back excuse me miss betty is that you charlie yeah open up come up one time you're a fine deputy sheriff well they had to drop on me oh don't get social playmate doug where'd you get that name never mind you know what that's safe there's the combination open it open it so get this stuff out of here dusty give me a hand with the old man we're going to need him listen ryder get him out of here and beat it but what about you i'm taking care of rider first are you all right i guess i am hey carob who did it better new johnson and some men sure clean it out i suspected that guy all along he had a prison look to him are you sure it was johnson it seems incredible for johnson to do it i still don't think he did well i do and i'm going to form a posse and round him up i'll go with you you get hurt of the duchess all right you get him no little beaver red what are we going to do does this mean we're wiped out oh no no there must be some other way i can't let all those people lose their money this betty we're in a very serious condition but there's just a chance that mr meeker can help us make her yeah you see the mr meeker's in touch with a lot of financial people it may be persuaded to carry us over you've handled our business at the banks for many years of course i can't promise anything definite but uh i'll do my best we'll have to do it in a hurry or the bank examiners will be down on us yes i know and we'd better be going well good night all right good night good night what have you got there me finding bank besides safe has anybody else seen this no well i don't want you to tell anyone about it me savvy what's the matter man betty lou i want you to do something for me it's very important so please don't ask questions all right red i want you to stay out of sight here and don't go near town but why remember no questions i can't tell you no i just got a punch they'll sure be glad to see you mr maker yes i guess they will it's no use arguing writer ms hopkins has failed to maintain this bank in a sound financial condition and as bank commissioner i'm compelled to protect the interest of the depositors mr meaker i accept your proposition well if you'll just hold up for a week i'm sure something will develop unfortunately ryder i'm afraid my people may not be so keen about this in a week's time here's the money and i've had quite a job raising it i'm afraid we're a lick rider well gentlemen that seems to be all for the moment rider i'll be glad if you'll arrange to have miss hopkins come in and sign the papers at once all right i'll write out to the duchesses right away oh ryder by the way how is betty lou but she's fine except for this money business she must have had a speedy recovery betty lou hopkins in critical condition daughter of the late banker hurt in hold up betty lou hopkins daughter of the late jason hopkins of blue springs is in a critical condition as a result of injuries received in the recent holdup of blue springs bank why that's ridiculous i just left her a few hours ago how did that get into the cheyenne papers not only cheyenne but every other paper on route this might explain writer's anxiety for a delay well what's his idea i don't know but i think i'll stop by the duchess's place and have a word with betty lou i thought you'd show up yes i was sure you'd show up old-timer how's betty lou take it easy now there's nothing to worry about betty lou is perfectly all right let's get inside but it says here that i know what it says i put it there what's the idea i had to get you here douglas where'd you ever get that name it'll be refounded in the bank after the robbery yes i'm jim douglas and betty lou you guessed right ryder she's my daughter my wife died right after i was sent to prison hopkins adopted betty lou i want to let it stay that way how about the robbery well i had nothing to do with that yes let's hear about the robbery douglas nice work red that newspaper eye to you was a good one ryder you pulled a pretty low down trick i didn't plan this put that gun away maker i'm sorry ryder douglas is wanted for murder and i am turning him in so

get away go after him hurry up you don't need to tie me up ryder i'll stay here i just want to make sure you see meeker after what jim here just told us there are a few things i want to check with colby and i just don't want you to mess anything up see you later and i'll give you a few more facts colby the robbers knew douglas by his right name they also knew the combination of that safe and they knew that jim douglas didn't want his daughter mixed up in his disgrace right you certainly don't think that and whose idea was it to plant 500 on him after the robbery as evidence taking you to douglas oh wait a minute writer you can't do that you know he's a desperate man and he's likely to shoot he might have very good reason to you'd better get your coat all right i said get it that's pretty keep it get him up ryder this time the barrel's on you you just got here in time sheriff he and jim douglas were gonna kill me you don't need to worry about douglas i just turned him over to the sheriff now just a minute sheriff well i think there are a few things mr colby should explain how the robbers got the combination of the safe for instance this is all so ridiculous he might as well accuse me of being mixed up in it maybe you've got something there for once you're not going to talk your way out rider get a move on hold it girl thanks little beaver i'll go get a piece of rope then get those armbands off quick oh gee red me you can keep them after you show them to douglas i want you to slip around to the back of the jail see if he recognizes them and be sure you're not seen i'll meet you later wolf hollow i can't stop to explain everything now but i want to get set for a shock a mighty big shock well what is it i've got to tell you this betty lou for his life may depend on it the man you know is johnson is really jim douglas jim douglas yes i've heard dad speak of him this is kind of hard for me to say buddy lou i want you to get hold of yourself jason hopkins is not
