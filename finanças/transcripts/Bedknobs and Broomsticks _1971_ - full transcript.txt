TOWARDS THE END OF HIS LIFE, ASTOROTH KEPT ANIMALS IN CAGES ... AND SEARCHED FOR THE SPELLS ... THAT WOULD MAKE THEM MORE LIKE HUMANS. THE LEGEND IS THAT THE ANIMALS REBELLED AT THE EXPERIMENT, KILLED ASTOROTH, AND STOLE MANY OF HIS POWERS. INCLUDING THE STAR WITH THE SPELL ON IT. POSSIBLY. THEY FOUND A SHIP, SAILED AWAY, AND WERE NEVER HEARD OF AGAIN. HOWEVER, THERE'S A FINAL NOTATION IN MY HALF OF THE BOOK, SAYING THAT IN THE 17th CENTURY, A SHIPWRECKED LASCAR WAS TAKEN FROM THE SEA ... HALF-MAD WITH THIRST AND EXPOSURE TO THE SUN.
