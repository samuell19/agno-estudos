THE BLUE WHALE Are you ready? Good morning, Mr. Hussam. Did you find anything? Nothing, sir. It's a complicated crime and needs time, and a full investigation. - What's this? - It's your coffee break, sir. Shut up. That's what I needed! The Blue Whale - Level 50 Your existence is meaningless... It's the same drawing. It's a suicide, Omar. It's possible. I am free from the world's restraints, heading to the afterlife. Mother and sister Niveen, I love you so much. Forgive me. Waleed. Sit down. You look exactly like in your videos. Thank you, Mr. Joe. Your beauty is a great asset to our project. Tell me. Is Noha your real name, or just an alias? Noha, Soha, or Hoda. Take your pick. Let's stick with Noha for now. - Noha it is. Whatever. - Right. What matters is your beauty. I have high hopes for this project. - It's a solid one. - Thank you. What do you think? It still needs to be clarified, Hussam. I hope it's not what I have in mind. What are your thoughts, sir? His mother and sister, sir. It's obvious. Sorry for your loss. What happened? Nothing happened. We were sleeping, when he heard a loud thud in the garden. I went out and saw Waleed lying on the ground, covered in blood. Was he mentally ill? Did he use drugs? No. Don't say that! My brother Waleed had no issues at all. He was very sociable. Everybody loved him. My brother was a religious guy. He never did those things. What made him do that? He withdrew from social life after the death of his father. He was so attached to him. I wanted to know... Sorry for your loss. Forgive us… We've bothered you enough. We need to go. Excuse us. Look at that/ It is a Blue Whale's suicide case. What's with the Blue Whale? Is it a new species or what? No. It's an online game. A bit complicated. First, molly and coke, and now the Blue Whale? The report is clear. No crime is committed. It's with the forensics now. - Do I fix you a sandwich? - Yes, please. Are you from Saudi Arabia? My father is, but my mother is Egyptian. When did you move here? We moved here when I was five. We settled here, my parents and I. My dad started a business. And then… he left us here. Mom, Waleed, and me. My father died three months ago. But recently… have you noticed any weird behavior? No. Waleed was optimistic. He was very sociable. People loved him, and he loved them back. But I don't know what happened to him lately. He stopped talking to his friends. Are you playing this game? - I'm telling mom. - So what? You could hurt yourself. Are you crazy? I'm crazy and bitter. No one feels me in this house. Mrs. Sahar, did you try to find out what's wrong with him? Huh? Did you try to make him open up? I've tried more than once. He was too upset, so I waited till he calmed down. This game has claimed the lives of many young men. Yesterday was the first time I hear about it. Four hundred people died. Can you believe it? This game claimed the lives of 400 young men. What's weird, is that up to the suicide challenge, the player needs to pass 50 challenges in 50 days. How is this possible? How can no one pay attention during all that period? I was going through a tough period, after losing my father. My mother and I had to take care of him. But it never crossed our mind that Waleed would do such a thing. I thought he was just sad about losing our father. Let her sign. Sign here, please. Put your trust in God. I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you. Thank you, Fagr. Sorry for your loss, Niveen. Thank you. I can't just leave Egypt after what happened to Waleed. - What are you two doing here? - What will we do in Jeddah? Shut down the business, and take her back to her country. Here is her country too. Let me tell you something. You can visit us occasionally. And we'll visit you back once in a while. Sorry for your loss, Niveen. I hope he's in a better place. May God bless us all. Hopefully. Can you take me with you? Hey, can you drop her on your way? I'm not going home. I need to go somewhere. Where to at this hour? - To the pier. - Really? What a gallant! She's still on your way. You're not going to Dubai's pier. Come on. It's fine. Forget it. I'll call an Uber. He doesn't want me to tag along. Dear. My thoughts are with you. You're so rude. Sorry for your loss. Dear. Be strong. I'll take good care of the business. Why don't you come to the office tomorrow? You'll be among friends. This is very helpful. - Okay. - If you need anything, call us. - Okay. - Take care of yourself. Be strong. I really don't get it. The way Nader treats Fagr is hideous. You're right, Amal. He's not human, not an animal or a plant. Not even a thing. Maybe a bacterium. Listen. Tell your friend to stay away from him. I told her many times. She loves him too much. - I don't know what she sees in him. - She loves him more than you love me? Come on! It's not the time. Are you nuts? - Give me a kiss. - You're so dumb. I told you several times, don't mix serious stuff with jokes. Not the pointing finger. It stresses me out. - Oussama. - Calm down. They're sad inside, and we're happy outside. We need to create a balance. Believe me. You're silly. She looks great in black. We need to go. Do you need anything? You know what? You know what? You and Mira, You know how much Waleed loved you both. Waleed loved you both. You'll always remind me of him. I… I want… I want something. Could you keep checking on me? And always remember Waleed. Are you leaving? Yes, dear. My flight is in two days. Take care of yourself and your mom. It's God's will. Put your trust in him. Medo! Medo! Why do you keep avoiding me? Why would I avoid you? There's nothing between us. What? Are you dumb? Look, I left the funeral, and I want some fun. Spare me your grumpiness. Aren't we in love to be married? Love is fine, but I'm not the marrying type. I'm too young to get married. If you're too young to marry, why did you hook up with me? THREE MONTHS LATER News broke out recently about multiple suicides among kids, triggered by an online game, The Blue Whale. The game targets kids and teenagers, who end up committing suicide. Families discover that their child committed suicide because of The Blue Whale. The idea behind it, is somehow to destroy our young members of society. A Russian guy created this game. He goes by Philip Putkin. He specialized in psychology. In his master's thesis, he addressed severe depression. He came to realize that teenagers suffering from severe depression, need a long time to recover. So death was an easier and faster solution. It would treat severe depression in a shorter time. Around 50 days. The new doctor wants to see you. - When will he be online? - Today. How's his clinic doing? He has lots of cases, and the results are faster. We need to shut down the project in Cairo and launch it elsewhere. We can shut it down alright, and make more money. You've turned into a wicked woman. I've learned from the best. You know, I'm from Alexandria. I was born there. And one day, we had to leave Egypt. I spent my youth missing Egypt. I had different jobs, until I landed a job in a giant telecom firm like Google. Then I got my Ph.D. in Middle East affairs. I did all this, so I'd return and get back at those who threw us out. Egypt is beautiful, Noha. I'm not saying this because it's my home country. It makes me feel at home. It's my country. Our country. And when the opportunity presented itself… I took it. People who take their own lives willingly, are toxic waste, to be disposed of. Clearly, his idea was rejected. But he didn't stop there. He pressed on. He went on with the game, but there were other cases. Fear induces the nervous system, to produce vast and toxic amounts of adrenaline. This vast amount of hormones can destroy the whole body. It accelerates the movement of the heart's muscles and tissues, and can explode in a second. Too much fear will stop the heart, and it dies. That's precisely what Dr. Gareer said. But I have one pressing question. Why do we disclose our plans at the end of each operation, before fleeing the country? The idea behind the game isn't to kill people, but also to test people's reactions to its different stages. - Then we can warn them. - But people are dying. And the death toll is enormous. Every invention claims its victims. What's crucial to our organization is the success of the trial. Got it? I think so. This is Dr. Moawad, a researcher in cyber crimes. Moawad Awad. 0123823898 or… We're talking about an online game. They get to choose who plays. Can anybody tell me how do they select them? - I have an important question. - Go ahead. Are you sure you're a doctor? Let's get back to our topic. - How do they choose them? - Good question. Through Mark's Facebook. Which is available for free. Free favors from Mark mean you're the bait. Hackers gain access to children's profiles. They scan for lonely, and introverted people, and they pick them accordingly. How can they tell? - They're hackers. - Not only that. Once they subscribe to the game, they send them a file hiding a virus. It allows them to collect the device's data. Or the cell phone, where they keep the mic open 24/7. The camera as well. They gather all the information, to the tiniest details, so they can use them later on. What about the cyber intelligence agencies? They can't capture them. Since they get to choose who plays the game. We can create fake pages, and pretend to be socially down. - That's how we get in. - What a stupid idea. Theoretically, she's right. But it's not a practical solution. They get to choose, and they're not stupid. We can always try. If we're in, it's fine. This is where you come in, Oussama. Find their location and IP address. We would be helping the cybersecurity agencies. Let's say they expose our plan. At least, we would've tried. I don't know what to say. We can always try. The Blue Whale. Sad love. I have good news. My parents will be here at the end of the month. - Hope they arrive safely. - Hopefully. We'd complete the project by then, and collect the money, so I can pay your parents a visit, with a nice gift. That's what I'm talking about. Make sure you get them Swiss chocolate. They love it. - Arabic sweets from a street kiosk. - What? What's this? You're good to play The Blue Whale. Click start to begin. Really? - Chocolate is too expensive. - I dare you not to do it. - I dare you. - Don't point your finger. - It stresses me out. - Yes? I got an invite from the game. She got an invite from The Blue Whale. Tell her to stop being silly, and go to sleep. Did you hear him? Go to sleep. I'm not kidding. Seriously? What is it? He also got an invite. - I'm serious. - Let me talk to her. Here. Hello? Listen to me. Did you click on the link? Did you click any buttons? Okay. Don't do anything until you hear from me. Just do what I tell you. See you. Are all your friends stupid like you? What will you get them? I'm thinking two kilos of persimmon. You're good to play. Click start to begin. - Yes? - All is good. I'm curious to know what keeps you hanging around. None of your business. I mean… why don't we leave this country together? Together? Dream on. Move. The 18th challenge. Are you ready to be a Blue Whale? If yes, carve a Blue Whale on your arm. Why did you do it, Medo? Mother? I need your help. Or you write the code F57 on your arm with a sharp tool. Then take a picture, and send it to us. Do I have to hurt myself to get you here? May God protect you, my sweet boy. Don't say that. I've never left you or your sister. I need to work to provide for you both. You're not a kid anymore. Your sister is a young woman now. You don't need me anymore to tell you what to do. Right, Medo? I know you're not happy with this. May God protect you, sweetie. What kind of game compels you to hurt yourself? It's The Blue Whale. Haven't you heard? It's all over the news. What the hell, you two? I work like crazy and you spend your time playing? Fine. Listen, Mira. Go to your room and study. Not a word. Go! And you, Medo. Enough playing, and do your homework. Listen. What is this game your sister mentioned? Hello? Yes, Samar? Are you serious? Are you saying we might get the deal? You made my day, Samar. You have no idea how much this was troubling me. Of course, I'll get you a huge diamond ring. A ring beyond your dreams. Let the deal happen first. I've been waiting for it for ages. Listen. Let's meet now and go through the details. Yes. Yes, I know it. Okay. Give me half an hour. Okay, dear. I'm on my way. See you. Mom? Make sure to pass all the stages. We can't do that. What about you, Oussama? You have nothing on them? Oussama is busy getting married. He doesn't care. Mind your own business and spare me your silliness. You should get an Oscar for best-rising stupid. Come on, guys. A round of applause for his foolish speech. Did you find something? Nothing. Not because I was busy. You got scared? A silly game doesn't scare me. Nothing scares me. You have to understand that they're protected by strong firewalls. They use different IP hosts and protocols, which are difficult to hack. Hard for you to understand. What happened? Your work here is done, Dr. No more media coverage. I already told you that, Gareer. The "doctor" thing got to your head? I am a doctor. Excuse me, Mr. Youssef. I have a say in the matter. This media exposure is promoting my clinic. I can't disappear all of a sudden. The game has already made the news. I see where you're going. Are you afraid to lose your patients, or your loaded bank accounts? - I love how smart you are. - Thank you, darling. You've already made a lot of money. You'll also work with us in other countries. Other places, new missions. We still need you. We know who you are. We know where you are. We can even see you in the dark. We know you by name, and we know your families. If you think you've played us, think again. We've played you. Fagr, Nader, Oussama and Amal! We get to choose who joins the game. You decided to join the game, but we decide when you can leave. - No. - Which is when you pass… all the game challenges. No! Let's delete the game from our phones. What about the videos of us drawing on our arms? My messages are being deleted. Mine too. Why don't you fix us a drink? Really? - Fix us a drink. - Okay. - What do you want to drink? - Your blood. Just go. I hope they catch you soon. - How are you, Nader? - I'm good. I know you don't love Fagr. You won't marry her. - Did she tell you that? - No. She told Amal, and Amal told me. - And… - There's no "and". You have to marry her. Or what? You'll have to deal with me. She's all alone, and you can't treat her like that. You need to fear God. - Are you her father? - You're an idiot. Don't say I didn't warn you. Fagr's problem is mine now. You're going to fix it, whether you like it or not. Got it? Whether you like it or not. Listen. Tell Oussama to leave me alone. Or I'll deal with you both. He's no match for me. Fine. I won't leave you alone. Do you hear me? What will you do about it? You'll know in due time. Goodbye. Mom? Mom? Mom? What? What happened? What happened to you? What is it? Calm down, dear. - Come on. Calm down. - I'm scared. Don't be scared. Go to sleep. Get some sleep. Don't be afraid. - Try to get some sleep. - Mom. Sleep, my dear. Have a good night. If you don't do the challenge by midnight, you can expect the grim reaper. Hello? Fagr? Calm down, Fagr. Calm down, Fagr. I'll call officer Hussam now. He has to help us. Hussam can't do anything. Things got out of hand. - I'm scared. - I won't let you. I won't let you, Fagr. - Calm down, dear. - Oh, God! Dear God! Is this really happening to us, or are we just obsessed with the game? I don't understand. I'm over-stressed, and I can't concentrate. I can't think. Thank God you're okay. Thank you, dear. I'm sorry if I added to your stress. Don't worry. I'm happy you're safe. It seems we're stuck with this, until the nightmare is over. - I'm scared. - Relax. I'll take care of it. Okay. Good night. Next challenge. Cut your lower lip with a sharp tool. Take a picture and send it to us. You have till midnight, or you'll be eliminated, and punished by death. I want you out of here. Have you lost your mind? You keep asking for money. I have no one else to turn to. Listen. We had a great time while it lasted. I'm not a charity. That's what we had? I can't believe you. I really can't. That's how you see us, Nader? Listen. Cut the crap. You're old enough to be my mother. Your mother? I was stupid to believe you. Do you know why I believed you? I wanted to be loved. I truly loved you. I wanted to carry your child. My ex dumped me because I couldn't conceive. I had no support. I did love you. I loved the child in you, a child I never had. Bravo! It's a beautiful act. Come on, Mom. Get lost. You're all alike, like my mother. She left me to marry a man my age. That's why I date older women. Get out! What happened? I heard a commotion. Go on. I followed the sound, then heard a loud blow. I was scared. I ran to Fagr's room. She wasn't in her bed. The bathroom's light was on. I tried to open the door. It was locked from the inside. I knocked and called her. She didn't answer me. I ran to my neighbor, Um Adel. Adel broke down the door. I found my daughter's body in the bathtub. My sweet daughter. My sweet and lovely daughter. Sorry for your loss. - My sweet daughter. - What did you find out? I told you, Hussam. You didn't believe me. You want me to believe this Blue Whale crap? It doesn't make sense. Why not? Cyber crimes are a fact now. I totally agree with you. Snapchat ruined the lives of many households. But TikTok is pretty decent. - Who are you? - Amin Abdul Gadid, sir. - You're Amin? - El Amin Amin Abdul Gadid. - El Amin or Amin. - You choose, sir. - Who's this guy? - Stop talking. Look, Omar. I only believe in facts that make sense. Suit yourself. Don't believe me. You killed the girl, you bastard. How could you? Don't touch me. What girl? Do you take me for a fool? - Fagr. - Fagr? Yes, Fagr. I have nothing to do with her death. I'm not a bastard. I never forced anyone to do something. They're all the same, as Nizar Qabbani said, "They're all prostitutes." You're sick. Your sick mind makes you believe things. If I were sick in the head, I wouldn't leave my mother in the arms of someone my age. If I were sick, I would've killed them both, and got away with it. What I did to Fagr, I'll keep doing it to all the others. You're an asshole. Asshole! - Fagr was a virgin. - Yes, she was. She went all the way, knowing I might not marry her. She can marry any moron. You're a lunatic. You're sick! Do you know why? I'm damaged. I don't wish it for you. So you kill her? You kill her, asshole? I have nothing to do with this. Fine. The cops are investigating. They'll catch the killer. Despicable bastard! Welcome, Mr. Omar. Please, come in. - Good morning. - Good morning. Any news? I have a good lead. I can't believe that a game kills so many people. I'm sure there's another explanation. You won't find it if you don't believe it's an online game. I don't understand. I understand everything. I still can't believe that Fagr is dead. And because of a game? May she rest in peace. Do you really think that a game is behind all this? - It's impossible. - What happened then? There was a killer. The police investigation will prove that. Oussama, I'm scared. I think we're next. No way. Don't be scared. I'll hit the shower now. I'll call you back. - Bye. - Welcome. Have a seat. I'm not here for consultation. Although I'm going through a very difficult time. In the last three months, I lost my father. Then my brother. Why are you here if not for a consultation? I have a scientific question for you. I'll be listening without interruption. Come on. Tell me everything. My brother killed himself because of The Blue Whale game. I see. Sorry for your loss. Thank you. That's not the issue. I've brought innocent people into the game. I asked them to play it. I don't know what to do. What happened to Fagr can easily happen to any of you. To avoid such fate, you need to engage in the game, and pass the challenges. If you refuse, you'll suffer the same fate. Thank you for coming. You're welcome here anytime. Thank you, Dr. Miss Noha is here, Dr. - Darling! - Hello! Hi. - Hello, Uncle. - Hello, dear. I can see you've become good friends. Are you as naughty as your uncle, Badoura? I'm no match for you. I need to talk to you, Noha. Of course. Any time, boss. I have to take care of what you asked me. - Okay. Go ahead. - Sorry. - Don't be late. - Sorry. Okay. Why don't you let me live with you in the States? Who will run our business here? I can think of many people. I have my eye on you as well. You have many businesses all over the world. - Who's running them? - You're weird, you know? My dream is to settle back in Egypt. Egypt is beautiful, Badr. And you want to leave this country. I have a solution. As Egyptians would say, there's a solution for every problem. I'll run the business here and you take my place there. Your ambition knows no limit. You wouldn't mind getting rid of me one day. Of course. Of course, I won't do it. If my dad had been here, he would've played with me. I asked you not to mention his name. Get rid of this teddy bear. I'll get you another one. Do as I tell you. This teddy bear cheers me up. You're so annoying. Just like your dad. He got on my nerves. Happy birthday, Medo. Happy birthday. Where's your mother? Medo! Medo! Medo! Medo! Let go of me! Let go! Let go! Please, I want to stay with him. I beg you. Let me stay with him. Just for a minute. Medo! Why did you do this to yourself? Medo! My boy! Why did you do this to yourself? Forgive me, son. Forgive me, son. Medo! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! I want to see my son! Open the door! I want to see my son! Forgive me, son. Open the door! Medo! He was upset. He was angry with me. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Mira! Mira. Let's sing him the Happy Birthday song. Let's sing Happy Birthday to your brother. Your brother is gone, Mira. Your brother is gone and left me alone. Your brother has left us, Mira. - Hello, Um...? - Um Fares. Um Fares. Why are you still here? Excuse me, Mr. Nader. The place was a mess. Dirty clothes and dishes. The place was so filthy. I worked a lot today. I left you 100 pounds with the janitor. Thank you. Excuse me. - Wait. - Yes? Here's an extra 50 for your hard work. Thank you very much, Mr. Nader. - Are you dumb? - What? I just gave you 50 pounds. One hundred with the janitor, and I'll give one more. Stay with me. Shame on you. I could've finished my work in your absence. I was doing you a favor. What's that noise? The game… is playing with my head. Is Abu Fares here? Abu Fares? Who's down there? Um Fares? You know how sleazy Nader is. He refuses to continue the game. He made a choice, and now he's paying the price. Didn't he call you for help? No, he didn't. I see. Then… how did you know he was in danger? I… I don't understand. I don't understand you. Why did you go to him after midnight? You wanted to crash at his place or to fight with him? Fight with him? He's a colleague. I can visit him any time I want. I get it. But it was a late visit. I need you to concentrate, Oussama. We're investigating a murder. Hold on a second. Are you accusing me of killing him? I was the one who reported the murder. We're not accusing you of anything. The murders that happened lately, are related to you and your friends. Don't you think it's a bit strange? I don't know, but… Is it related to The Blue Whale game? So, do you think it's cybercrime? It's not for me to say. You can investigate the matter. The investigation was futile. Who killed Nader? I didn't kill him. I reported the crime. Sometimes the killer reports the crime. I can't be the one who killed him. Why would I kill my friend? I love life. I don't take a life. I can't even kill an ant. How would I kill a human being? We're aware of this. We know you didn't kill him. I just want to know. What made you go to him at that hour? Good question. These mysterious things bug me a lot. You don't have to be bothered. The matter is very simple. I went to see him for a work-related matter. I knocked on the door, and no one answered. I called him on the phone. I heard it ringing from inside. If he didn't want to pick it up, he would've put it in silence mode or went to another room. I kept hearing the ringing, so I got worried. I called you guys, You came and discovered the body. Excuse me, sir. It's my wife. Hold the investigation until I'm back. Get out! Now! We're done here, Mr. Oussama. You can go. - Mr. Omar. - Forget it, Hussam. - Really? Can I go? - Yes. - Can I go? - Yes. I'm not a suspect. I didn't kill him. Did you bring the pictures? Yes. - Let me see. - Here. Niveen, right? Yes. Your brother Waleed. Yes. This is my brother Waleed. Show me your hand. Yes. The other hand. Take this amulet. Go to a cemetery, half an hour before dawn. And bury the amulet. No. I can't do this. Don't you want the game gone? - Yes. - Dig the grave next to your brother's, and bury this. Bury the amulet, but before you do, cover it in blood first. No! I can't! I can't do it! I can't do it! Wake up at 4:20, and watch the video that we'll send you. So, they died because of the game, or more precisely, it killed them. Who killed them? Um Fares used to work for Nader. She used to clean his house. She and her husband planned to steal Nader's money. They emptied the house from tiny expensive things. Unfortunately, they overstayed in the house. - And Nader came home. - Hurry. Mr. Nader is coming soon. I'm done. - He's here. - I'll hide inside. - Who are you? - I'm… Who am I? I'm no one. No need to call the police. - Calm down. - Let me explain. Explain to the police. If that's the case… Oh, God. What are you doing? May he rest in peace. What about Fagr? Fagr is a different story. She wasn't murdered. - What? - Yes. A forensic report said that she died of an electric shock. Due to a short circuit. My dear Fagr. So the game has nothing to do with this. - You're taking it out of proportion. - No! Oussama and Amal are still in the game. Today is the next-to-last challenge. The penultimate challenge. You're steps away from being the Blue Whale. Cut off your smallest toe from your right foot. Take a picture and send it to us. THE PENULTIMATE CHALLENGE Cut your left ear nipple. Take a picture and send it to us. - So it's not the game? - No. The game stressed you out, and made you believe things. Tomorrow is the final suicide challenge, Thank God. We saved Oussama and Amal. I don't get it. How can anyone kill themselves? If not for the medical intervention, we would be facing a bigger problem. I don't get it, and I know nothing. Listen to me carefully. We'll play by the Whale's rules. They need to know that the challenge has been met. We'll do the challenge. - What do you mean? - I don't get it. - We'll act the challenge. - What? We will act the challenge. You'll go back to your home. Till you get the message of the 50th challenge. The suicide. Now, your existence is meaningless. No one cares about you. No one cares about what you think. For them, you're nothing but toxic waste. Your death will relieve you, and trouble them. You've tried all the challenges. We now know that you're ready to overcome your fears. Then you write a note to your parents, saying you'll kill yourself. Take a picture of it, and send it to the game. Mom, Dad, I've waited for you too long, I'll kill myself. Then place the letter on your mobile. As if by mistake. We now know that you're ready to overcome your fears, and that you have what it takes to become a Blue Whale. Commit suicide now! Kill yourself. Death awaits you. Death won't beat you, but you'll beat death. Now! Now! We'll post the pictures on different sites, showing the couple who were victims of The Blue Whale. Then, you get rid of your mobiles. Dr. Gareer? - Tell me everything. Now! - No! Please, stop Mr. Hussam. That's not how we treat people. Don't be afraid. Tell me. When did you start working for him? A year ago. Okay. Can you think of someone visiting him at night? No. He leaves first, and I close the clinic. Can you think of an unusual patient? - I don't understand. - Any walk-ins today? Today, he had two sessions, and they left early. He wanted to stay, and asked me to leave. Very well, and then? I left, but he was busy that day. More than usual. Classified as another suicide case. You must've heard it wrong. Okay, bye. Did anything happen? Where's Badr? He's on his way. I just called him. He's on his way. I don't want you to worry. I've planned everything and we're flying out in two days. I don't get it. Someone is misinforming the boss. The boss already knows everything. No, Noha. Something fishy is happening. You got me worried. You see? They were all suicide cases. The suicide act of Amal and Oussama, paid off, and they beat the game. So, the game does exist! What game, sir? This is all nonsense. Nonsense? Fine, Hussam. I'll see you when you come back from your leave. I'll go pack my stuff, and hit the coast. I'm so tired. Why don't you visit me? I'll try. Believe me. - Have a nice trip. - I'll call you at night Whale nonsense. What whale? Oh, gosh. They can resist, but we'll always win. They can join hands, but we'll always control them. Their weakness is their differences. Rumors are our weapon. Our weapon is the lost youth. Our lost youth must believe our rumors, and see them as actual facts. We need to instill fear. Fear is the only weapon to control them. Wait! It's still early. - Right, Noona? - Of course. I'd like to know you better, Joe. My lovely Joe. - Isn't that so, Badoura? - Right, boss. How are you, Joe? I've missed you. I'm so happy, of your success, in everything we do. More than expected. I don't understand. - You are... - The boss. Right, Noona? Welcome, boss. I'm happy to see you in person. I've worked for you for many years. The pleasure is mine too. But I already know you too well. - Right, Noona? - Yes, boss. Badoura! Badr is your nephew, right? That reminds me. Badr will run the new games. I'm at your service, boss. We've learned that the police force have exposed you. They're watching you. We also learned… that your conscious is awakening. That's why you have to die. You've reached the end and you have to admit defeat. We do exist. And we'll make you believe it in blood. That's the whole story. Since we started the game, with Dr. Youssef. Since our first kill, until today. Is that it? That's the robe your put on? You're into action, right? You bastards! Bastards! You want to control our youth, with your terrorist ideas. To inflict fear in them. To deprive them of hope. What are you aiming at? What are you aiming at? I'm not saying I'm innocent. I'm not asking you to release me. I know I deserve to die or any punishment you think of. You need to know one thing. I'm the arm. Do you know what that means? They are the head. If you don't get them, there will be tens of Nohas. Do you know why? Because extreme poverty makes want money. I'd do anything, and I'd sell anybody. Have you ever been hungry? Have you ever experienced deprivation? What did I want from life? All I hoped for was to find someone, who can take care of me and love me. I found no one. I needed money so badly. And the need makes you do anything. I need you to understand one thing. They're not the only victims. I'm also a victim. The only difference is that they died for real. While I'm a walking corpse. That's your excuse? You have no excuse. You're truly a walking corpse. You're dead inside. You say you're the arm, right? You're not the head. But the head used arms to ruin the youth of our country. What poverty and deprivation are you talking about? What poverty? Poverty and deprivation… are easier than humiliation. Got it? You said you wanted to learn how to love. You can't learn how to love, you're born with it. Life teaches how to face fear, weakness and injustice. We shouldn't know fear. Do you hear me? We shouldn't know fear. We shouldn't know fear. We shouldn't know fear We shouldn't hide from life Nor turn our back on it We shouldn't know fear We shouldn't let weakness Control our pride We shouldn't know fear We shouldn't hide from life Nor turn our back on it We shouldn't know fear We shouldn't let weakness Control our pride We're young, we're poor But we're not helpless. We face life ordeals No one can intimidate us. We're young, we're poor But we're not helpless. We face life ordeals No one can intimidate us. Any effort to suppress us Was met with extreme failure We shouldn't know fear..." Translated by Nidal Monzer
