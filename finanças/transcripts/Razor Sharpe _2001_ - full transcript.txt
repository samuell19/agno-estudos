(soft music) (tense music) (men shouting) (punching) (arrow cracking) (metal clanging) - [Man] What the hell do you think you're doing? - Was that alright? - Yeah, it was alright, it looked alright. - Lee! - What's up, man, that was great. I loved that shit with the arrows. You taught him that, didn't you? - It's not in the script. - Fuck the script, we'll put it in the script. You know that shit sells tickets. - Look, Lee, he's bringing the whole production down. I can't permit that to happen. - What are you talking about? He's giving you a great run for your money. He looks great. All right, all right, I'll get him to tone it down a little bit. Everything will be cool, alright? - You will fire him in front of everyone on this fucking set, do you understand me? Look, they come to see me. Rick fucking Cooper, not some punk they never heard of. Now you will fire him in front of everyone. - What am I supposed to tell him, man? - Just tell him he wasn't good enough and do it in front of the whole crew. I'll be in my trailer. - Asshole. Justin, come here. - Yeah? - Hey, I hate to tell you this, but this is just not gonna work out. - Why, what did I do? - It's not what you're doing, you're doing great. You look great, man, I love what you're doing. - Well then why am I getting fired? - It's just not gonna work out. It's not gonna work out. - Well what'd he think? Let me ask him. Rick, Rick! - I'm really sorry about this, man. If it was up to me I'd keep you. - Bullshit! - Come on. (tense music) (engine revving) (upbeat music) (tense music) (man shouting) - Man, you get a job with Rick Cooper you just go around acting like him, man. Help me up so I can whoop your big ass. What's wrong with you coming in with your face all tight? What's wrong with you? - I got fired, I got canned. - Like in preserves? - No, like a roasted chicken. Hell yeah, man, I got fired. I mean, director fired me in front of everybody. He said I wasn't good enough. And then had the audacity to tell me I was bringing down the production. - Down, what you mean down? He couldn't have been looking at you because you the original Karate Kid Action Jackson episode 19 through 45 Kung Fu the ugly years. - You play too much, Charles. - All right, chat with me, man. What happened for real? - I don't know, man. I mean, everything that I've learned and practiced all my life was flowing through my blood like water down the river. I mean, I really freaked him out when I caught the arrow, you know what I'm saying? - You caught what? - Caught the arrow, man. - How do you catch, what do you catch it, in your leg or your shoulder, where? - In my hand, man. - No, man, what I'm saying is how do you catch an arrow? - How do you get to Carnegie Hall? - I don't know, I don't live in New York, man. - Practice. - That doesn't make sense to me, man. You catch an arrow and they fire you. Come on, man, you do something amazing like that and they fire you? It doesn't make sense, man. - I don't know, man. Maybe they thought that I was trying to show Rick up. Maybe they thought I was trying to mess his thing up. I wouldn't do that to the guy, he that gave me my first break. I mean, he's my friend for Christ sake. He probably don't even know they doing this shit. - Come on, man, we talking about Rick Cooper. - [Justin] He don't know what's going on! - Oh, he knows. - He's my friend. - Rick Cooper's ego is bigger than my dick and you know how big that is. - Yeah, big as your imagination, okay? - Muy grande here. Touche. - See you later. - Peace, say hey to Rick for me. (tense music) (door knocking) - Come in. Mr. Sharpe, have a seat, Mr. Sharpe. The word out on the street is that you're difficult to work with. Now that might be all right if you're Rick Cooper and you've made it but you're just Justin Sharpe and you're still not dick. I will no longer represent you. Now will you please leave my office? - But, fine. You'll regret it. - Yeah. Yeah, Rick. Yeah, it's done. Rick, what the hell did this guy do to deserve this? Oh, I see. All right. (speaker voice muffled) - Late again. Okay, alright, chill. Hey, man, it's a little rough. Is that a Bud Light, man? - Shut the hell up. - You could rob me with whatever you want to but I'm just like damn, he ain't got no heavier artillery than that? - Excuse me, can I get some help, man? - Oh, hey Charles, I didn't see you standing there. It's been a bad day, man. - You're having a bad day? What do you think we're doing? - Man, shut the hell up and you get out of here. (kicks smashing) - I tried to tell y'all white boys about coming around here and robbing decent poor black folk. - Hey man. - You need to be in a white neighborhood. - Put that out to the garbage. - Give me some help. You know they ain't gonna believe a white guy tried to rob me when I tell them this, man. Sure you don't wanna go out, man? Jay, look man, I know you don't drink but I will buy you all the cranberry juice you can put down but you need some laughter in your life, man. You look pretty down, you sure you don't want to go? Cranberry juice. - And to think people call you a cheapskate. - I tell you what, you stay here and mope, man. I'm gonna go get my laugh on and for all those people that were talking about me you make a list of each and every name and I want you to personally mule kick 'em into the trash, like you did old boy. Do it on a Thursday because they don't pick up on Wednesday. - You give me their names too, alright? - All right, rudy-poo, peace. - Yeah. See you when you get back. (intense music) - [Man] Yeah, get tough! (phone ringing) (metal clanging) - Hello? Yeah. What? No, I'm not doing anything. Sure, I can meet you right away. Okay, see you soon, bye. (upbeat music) - I'm glad you could make it on short notice. I wanted to catch you before I left for the theater. - Yeah well, you're the last person in the world I thought would want to see me. - Welcome to the Mill, my name is Calvin. Can I get you something to drink? - We're not gonna be here that long so nothing for me, but Daria. - Wine please. - Blush wine be okay? - Yeah, that's fine, thank you. I tore you away from dinner, didn't I? - No, not really, I ate earlier. - I want you to know I thought you were great out there. - With who, the waiter? - No, on the set. I'm no expert, but you did some things out there I hadn't seen before. - Well, I'm sure being around Rick Cooper you've seen plenty. - Yeah, plenty that's better left unseen. - I'm sorry? - Forget it. Listen, I thought you got a raw deal out there and a guy like you deserves better. I know some people that are putting together a low budget feature. They need someone with your skills. The pay isn't good but it's a way back in. Are you interested? - Are you kidding? Yeah, I mean, who's doing the film? Who's directing and who's producing it? - Oh, wait a minute. I don't know about all that, but I've got a name and number for you. Do you have a pen? - Sure. I can't believe this. Man, I thought with you being Rick's girl and all. - Let's get one thing straight. I'm a person, not a possession and neither Rick Cooper nor anyone else owns me. I decide with who and where I go. - With whom do you choose to go with the evening? - I don't see how that's any of your business. Do you want the number or not? - Sure, I do. And I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry into your personal life. - You're making it sound like that would be a bad thing. - Yes. - Let's go. (tense music) - So did you set it up? - Yeah, I did. - Rick told me to give you this. (muffled screaming) Drive on. (tense music) - Hey, Chucky boy, wake up. So anyway I hear these guys are kind of like guerrilla filmmakers, you know, bum rush the place and get as much until the cops get there. Shit, it ain't no feature, but never can tell, you know, maybe somebody to sees me, what do you think? - Yeah, the director's mother, she'll see you. She probably won't even rent it. - I ain't gonna even fall into your negative vibe today, man. You seen my belt? - Check your waist. - Anyway man, I mean, what kind of example are you setting for anybody anyway? It's 10 o'clock in the morning, you still got your happy ass on the couch, laying down doing nothing in your pajamas. - What, that's what I do. Just 'cause I don't have a job, don't want no job. And I don't want to lay on the couch with pajamas on, I sleep naked, okay? - Well you need to close that up and show it to somebody who can do something with it. - Yeah, you just intimidated by my manhood. That's all it is. - Yeah, I'm intimidated by your manhood, alright, more intimidated by the smell. And as far as your manhood is concerned, buddy boy, that's kinda small. - Oh, that's it, defend yourself Karate Joe! - I'll see you later, wish me luck. - Bad luck. (mumbling) You're the boss, my friend. He don't know what he talking about, man. You been through the worst, my friend. Through the worst, man, do you remember Rosa? She was a good one. You lasted all night, man, I love you, man. If I could kiss you, I would. I'm telling you I love you. (tense music) - Hey, how are you doing? - You must be Justin. - Yeah, I'm Mr. Sharpe. - I'm Carlos. I see you've met Mr. Griffin. - Yeah, the strong, silent type. - My man is a great actor. Don't worry about him. This is Kirby. - How you doing, man? - How you doing? - Justin here is gonna be helping us out with those high flying stunts today. Ain't that right, Justin? - Yeah, whatever you say, I wish you guys would've shown me some of this stuff earlier. Maybe I could've rehearsed it all. - Don't worry about it. I like what we do to be very spur of the moment. If it feels right for you, man, just go for it bro. - I'm your man, just tell me what to do. - Besides, man, you come on the highest recommendations. I know you're gonna do good. Anyway, we gotta roll. Everybody, let's get in the van. (engine starting) (tense music) - Hey, give me the suitcase. - You need to get out of here, buddy. - Come on, man, come on, they're watching, give me the suitcase. - Take this guy. - Why don't you get out of here, man? (guns shooting) - Shit. - What the fuck happened here? Where's my bloody money? Who stole my money? Damn it, Espo. (gun shooting) (siren wailing) Well, I'm not going to pay that dickhead's hospital bill. You find these fuckers, Espo, and bring them to me. No one steals my money and lives to spend it. Go! - Yeah, I'll run it by him. If he tries to walk I'm gonna fucking kill him. Yeah, I know, all right so far. All right, we're gonna get him up, ciao. Somebody wake him the fuck up. Get him up! (Sharpe screaming) Mr. Sharpe, my favorite new actor. How would you like to see your award winning performance in our little movie today? - What's going on? What did you guys do? - That's where you're wrong. It's not what we would do to you, Mr. Justin Sharpe. It's more like what your ass did to those poor men. Hey Kirby, man, pop in the tape. I want to show our hot shot here exactly what he's in for. - I've almost figured out this puzzle, can't you wait a second? - You can't figure out that puzzle if I gave you 28 letters of the alphabet. - There ain't no 28 letters in the alphabet, bonehead. - Who you calling bonehead, dick breath. - You, motherfucker! - You talking to me? - Yeah bitch! (speaker voice muffled) - Oh yeah, right now. - Motherfuckers, shut the fuck up. - Now put the God damn guns away. You, put the fucking video in! Like children, I swear. Oh, you're gonna love this. - Come on, man, why don't you give me the suitcase? - Take this guy. - Why don't you get out of here, man? (guns shooting) - So here's the situation, this tape is the only link to the crime. I'm sure the police and Stevie Watson would each love to have this, but you know I might not want to give this to them. I might just want to give this back to you. - I guess I'm supposed to be flattered, right? (punching) - Come on, what are you gonna do? - Before we continue, I believe my boy Jay will have a few words to say. Thank you, Jay. - No problem. - Now as I was saying you have a choice. Since you impressed us so much with your little audition we'd like to have you come join our team. Our employers asked that I give you this option. - Gee, I thought you were the brains enough. - We can use someone with your skills and hey, this is a lucrative business. - Yeah well, who's your boss then? - Oh, you'll meet him in due time. But before that, I want to know your second option. - What, you give the tape to the police? - Now would I do that to you? If you say no, this tape goes directly to Stevie Watson. His justice is far more swift than the police. - Yeah, well aren't you afraid that I'll give you up before he kills me. (laughing) - If Stevie Watson finds you, you won't have time to shit your pants before he kills you. He's not one of the more patient men that you'll ever meet. - If I do it? - Well, you can make yourself a lot of money and hell, you'd never have to audition for us again. - I want some time to think about it. - I'll give you two hours. Jay, grab the briefcase. We're gonna make a little deposit. And you two idiots, keep an eye on him. You have two hours. After that I'm gonna make you a video star. For safe keeping. (sirens wailing) - Here's what we got, we got two bodies down. One body over here, one over here. Broad daylight hit, absolutely no witnesses. Got at least two different caliber cases so based on the number of bodies I'd say we have at least two shooters. Amy thinks they all died on the spot. Get this, we got a make on a black Mercedes Benz. - Watson doesn't like fairies. - So what are you saying, Watson whacked his own guys? - Let's just say he didn't want any survivors. This is definitely a sign of disapproval. - It's a hell of a sign. - Yeah, well, five years ago there were only five or six small time operations. Old Watson was sent down here to consolidate them all under one umbrella. If you didn't outright hand over your business to him, you were soon found somewhere stuffed in some sewer with half your head blown off. We must have found at least a dozen bodies. All with ties to the mafia, could never tie any of them to Watson. Couple of months after that, he had all the illegal gambling up and running in the city. Soon after, narcotics, drugs, just some small pocket change. - So who the hell would be bold enough to do a broad daylight hit like this? - Bold isn't the word. Foolish is more like it. I mean, if this is just someone trying to move in on his territory, we'll know about it soon enough. There'll be all out war. On the other hand, if this is someone from one small time rip off then you my friend can clock out early. - Clock out early? What the hell is that supposed to mean? - Old Watson is gonna do our job for us. Odds are we'll be called in to identify some John Doe with half his head blown off and it'd be our perp. I guarantee you it could be our man. - I don't know how he got away but Kirby and Johnny are dead, fricking Evan's got the shit beat out of him. No, I agree, we can't wait. I'll have the tape dropped off by Watson tonight. We could've used that son of a bitch though? He was good. Look, once Watson's got the tape he could buy a casket for your boy. Look, Watson will get him. Yeah, but. Alright, alright, alright. He wants us to get to Sharpe first. - Watson gonna blow his ass up. - I know but he's just afraid Sharpe's gonna talk. - You know Watson, he don't believe in conversation. - Well you know, just to be on the safe side, it won't hurt if we kill him. - I ain't got no problem with that. - Somehow I didn't think you would. - Let's get his ass up and get the fuck outta here. (tense music) Why are you so jumpy, little man? Do you think we enjoy hurting you? Every time Mr. Griffin hits you- - Yeah, yeah, I know, it hurts him more than it hurts me. But I tell you what, why don't both of y'all go play in traffic and I'll feel much better. - I've got an idea. Maybe not as good as yours, but I think you'll like it. Tell us where your friend is and we won't have to kill you. - I told you, man, I don't know where he is. - And now I'm telling you, if you can help us find your friend you have no value to us as a hostage. Mr. Griffin has been begging me there all morning to kill you and put you out of his misery. Making Mr. Griffin happy is what life's all about for me. So you see if you can't help us find your friend Justin, then soon I have no use for you. If he doesn't know you're with me he can't come and rescue you. And if he can't come and rescue you- - Why didn't you just call him out the window? - I prefer the element of surprise. - Oh yeah, you think I got a bat signal I send and he just comes, just shows up. - I'll ask you one last time. Do the three of us leave here to go find your friend Justin or do just the two of us leave here to go find a place to wipe your blood off our shoes? - Hello, Diana, are you there? Hey, well listen, this is Justin. Something really weird has happened but I'll explain it to you when I get there. See you later, bye. - Well? - No, he wasn't at his apartment. We broke in there and we found some asshole claiming he's his roommate. We worked him over a bit though. Griffin's got him outside in the van. - You shouldn't have involved anyone else? - Yeah, what were we supposed to do, leave him to identify us? I don't think so, the stakes are much too high. - All right, all right. Hang on to him and flush out Sharpe then kill both of them. - Yeah, well that's the next question, where the hell do we find Sharpe? - I think I know. I think I know. - Daria? Daria? Daria? Shit. Daria? (somber music) Shit. I'm sorry. Whoever did this, I'll get 'em. (tense music) - Where are you going, Mr. Sharpe? I'm gonna go around back, you go this way. (sticks banging) (punching) (upbeat music) - Why don't you give me the suitcase? - Take this guy. - Why don't you get out of here, man? (guns shooting) - [Watson] Who delivered this tape? - Some kid dropped it off with the bouncer. Other than that, we don't know a thing about it. - Well, whoever filmed this was obviously in on it. Why they're giving him up I have no idea. Perhaps he's dead already and they just want us to chase our dicks around for a while. Or perhaps they want us to kill him for them. Either way, get this picture to everyone. If he's alive, he can give us the rest of the crew. I'm going to kill them and anyone they ever fucking spoke to. As for our friend, the Karate Kid here, turn him into a human pinata and hang him where everyone can see. - Gladly. - There's going to be a message attached to this one. A bloody strong message. (tense music) - Shit, what are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - Trying to find something. (speaker voice muffled) - What was that? - Don't worry about it. You gotta go, okay? - I need to get some of my things, no way. - You gotta go, okay? - 442? I guess this is it. (suspenseful music) - There's a good chance he'll be coming back for this stuff. - So what you want us to do? - Just wait around for him, see what happens. - They told you to go in here, that'll be the first place they look for you. - Yeah, well they probably already been here. Besides, there's a lot of things I need that I can't get from nowhere else, include my keys, I can't keep hot wiring a car. (speaker muffled) - Only you would leave your car in an alley and get it back. - Yeah, minus the radio and hub caps. - Bitch, bitch, bitch. - Anyway, yeah, so what. Just stay here, I'll be right back, okay? Stay here, I'll be right back. - I'm coming. I'm not staying here. I'm coming with you. (tense music) - Oh shit. - Buenos dias, Mr. Sharpe. I believe this is what you're looking for. I think you need to come with us. - When I tell you, you take off running, okay? Go! - Justin! - Let her go. - I think I need to just get the hell out of here. - Justin, you gotta help me, just kill him! (punching) - You okay? - Yeah. Is this how it's gonna be until they finally kill us? - Don't worry, we're gonna make it, okay? You don't mind if we borrow your car, do you? - No. - I didn't think so. Get in. Shit, one of those are Rick's guys. - Rick's too cheap to hire anyone outside of his payroll. - I guess we'll have to assume they were Watson's people. - We gotta get out of here before the police come. - In this neighborhood, hell, we still got a few minutes. - You're not going back into that apartment, are you? - Calm down, they brought out my stuff for me. - Good morning. - Oh, I trust you have better news for me than the DOW did today. - I believe I have, boss. - Unbelievable! (laughing) - Yeah, and you're not gonna believe this. The guy is an actor, an out of work fucking actor. But, hell, we start showing this picture around to a few of our friends in the entertainment business and they cough him right up. - I love it! Probably his own agent that gave him up. - Yeah, he was even good enough to put his address on the back of it so he tries to go home, we got a little welcoming committee set up for him. - Well don't forget the tape. Apparently he's some sort of Bruce Lee wannabe and I want him alive and well, almost. - No problem. Sent a few of my own kind out there and they're allowed to break every bone in his body but his neck. They're saving that one for you. - Who's as good to me as you, Espo? Oh, by the by, if we ever have a breakdown in security as we did yesterday I'm going to have to kill you. Do you understand? - Yes sir. - Good. Let me know as soon as our honored guest has arrived. Take him to the club and make sure that he's kept as uncomfortable as possible. - Yes sir. - Should have seen this cutie in there, man. Told her I was coming back about five o'clock so we might need to swing back this way when we get off. How come you don't have the radio on? What if something happens? (phone ringing) You set that shit up, didn't you? - Willis. Yeah. Shit, any survivors? Uh-huh, yeah. Anybody question him? Uh-huh, hold on one second. All right. Sharpe, Justin Sharpe. Yeah, okay, well look, you find out anything else, you know where to reach me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, owe you one. Looks like they found a couple of bodies over on Crossing and Jamison. There was one survivor. They questioned him, all they could get out of him was Justin Sharpe. Every time this fucking Sharpe's around, somebody dies. What the fuck is this? - It was either that or the donut holes, man. This is all they can get out of him, Sharpe, one name? See, you and me need to go down there. I bet you we can get something out of him. - Yeah, sound like he's in pretty bad shape already. Let's go down there and maybe throw a chokehold on him or something. That'll get him squealing like a pig, huh? - You know what I mean? - It wouldn't do any good anyway. It's just Watson retaliating for what happened at the bank the other day. Just wasn't expecting Sharpe to get in this shit again. Look, I want you to go down there and find out everything you can on this Sharpe guy, who he's working for, who he's running with, who's running with him. This couldn't be one guy kicking all of Watson's men's ass. But if it is, we gotta find him first. - This shit only happens in the movies. (engine starting) (siren wailing) - What is this place? - Takayama taught me everything that I know. - About fighting? - No, about life. My mother died giving birth to me. My dad died when I was nine. And I shuffled around a little bit, ended up with my aunt. She had six kids, full-time job, so we didn't have very much supervision at all. Anyway, most of them got caught up in the thick of things and ended up with the wrong people. Me, I was lucky. I found Mr. Takayama. He taught me structure and discipline. - Where is he now? - He died last year. Had no living relatives so he left me everything, including this place. - Why don't you open it and teach here? You'd be a natural. - Me, I always wanted to be in the movies. The whole Hollywood scheme of things appealed to me. - What do you think about it now? - Same old political backstabbing bullshit as any job. Only this job, they're using real knives. - But you get to meet a lot of nice people. - Only one that I can think of at this point. (romantic music) We can't do this, let's just try to get some rest, okay? (tense music) - I guess crime does pay. - [Man] A Detective Willis and Benton to see you, sir. - You tell them to wait five minutes and then show them back. - Hope you don't mind, sleazy boy. Got a busy schedule, no time for your little shitty games, okay? - Detective Winston, is it? - Close enough. Look, Stevie, we're looking for whoever took out your boys the other day. I know you got a busy schedule and all so I'll be real brief. We're just hoping that you might have something constructive to add to it, okay? - Detective, I can't believe that you would barge into my home and so callously remark about my good friends who were so brutally murdered just yesterday. - Look, Stevie, save that for your lawyers, okay? All I know is whoever brutally murdered your boys the other day is still out there. And when we find them, I hope they got a lot to say. It'd make for some interesting conversation, don't you think? Well, gotta go, your tax dollars at work, but I'll see you real soon, Stevie. Real soon, Stevie boy. - Damn it! (glass breaking) - Where do you think you're going? (woman screaming) - Bitch. (intense music) (guns shooting) - Shit. - Come on, let's get the fuck outta here. - Justin! (engine revving) - Shit! (water splashing) (jet ski revving) (mumbling) Daria, I'm coming. Daria. - Justin. Are you okay? Relax. - I had a bad dream. - Calm down. (romantic piano music) - Could be his lover for all we know. Anyway, he doesn't look too tough, huh? - You know, I don't see why we don't just bust his right now and get him to tell us where everyone else is. - Sometimes I just don't think you get it at all. Am I that bad of a teacher? - We've got this guy on two counts of murder. One attempted murder with a surviving witness. Now he is involved in this Watson thing, we can leverage his ass to roll over on everyone else. - Gimme this. Look, first of all, the shit that happened the other day, he'll probably get off on that for simple self-defense. The guy has a clean record, nothing. Secondly, if we take him now Watson would never come after him. We need him out there for Watson to come after him. - So we're just gonna wait on Watson to kill his ass? - No, the reason why we're here is to prevent that from happening. Any of this sinking in? - Yeah, little bits here and there. Let you know when I've had enough. - What the hell are you doing? - Just turning on the radio. What if something comes in? How are we going to know if something goes on if we don't have the radio on. - Don't touch that shit, okay. Here, here, use the phone. - Yeah, Denton here. Zero seven one one four. No, oh yeah, okay. No, no one knows? All right, cool, thanks. You see, it pays to check in. You my friend got an anonymous present tonight. Videotape of our muscle head friend over there killing two of Watson's men. Making off with two bags of something. - A video tape? Who the hell sent in a tape? - No one knows, a concerned citizen though. They say whoever shot that tape was right there in the middle of the heist. - What the fuck is going on? I sure hope these guys got a good place to hide tonight. Every cop in the city is going to be looking for their ass. (soft music) - Good morning. - Hey. - Morning. - Good morning. Listen, I want you to stay here, okay? - What do you mean stay here? Where are you going? - We can't hide out forever. I gotta go do something and then I'm going to the cops, tell them what happened. Maybe they'll understand. - Yes officer, I know there are no cameras other than a camcorder. Yes, I thought it was a movie. I'm really sorry about shooting those two men. Can I go now? - I know it sounds farfetched, but there's also some mobster guy named Steve Watson after us as well. - Steve Watson? - I mean, I think that's his name. - Great, I finally found a decent guy and by the afternoon he's gonna be fish food. - Hey, I like fish. - Don't kid around, Justin. This guy kills people for living. We gave him money last year and he almost got shot over $5,000. - Rick knows this guy? - Rick has a big gambling problem. - So that's how Rick know when and where the drop was gonna be. He's been scoping the guys out before. Think I finally got something on Mr. Rick Cooper. Fucker. Listen, I gotta go, okay? (soft music) I'll never believe that you set me up. There's kind of weird stuff going on. Don't worry about Diana though. I'll take care of her. I'm gonna find out who did this to you. And when I do, they'll pay. God, take care of her, she's a good person. (tense music) (guns shooting) (neck cracking) - God damn it, Espo, that's it! You personally handle everything from here on in. Fucking karate guy is going to handle another fucking karate guy? Use guns! Bam, bam, they go gown, end of story. You hit these fucking karate guys over the head with a lead pipe, they keep coming, I know, I've seen the movies. - Yeah, we'll get him this time. - You're bloody well right you'll get him. Espo, I've always treated you like a brother, haven't I? - Always. - Well, I'm going to do a Cain and Abel on your ass if you don't bring him in. That money was not all mine. I have to kick back most of it to New York and you know how forgiving they are when it comes to cash. Now listen, I've been thinking and that job had to be pulled by someone with inside information. - Not one of our guys. I've checked them all out and- - No, no, I agree with you. Not one of ours, but certainly someone who knew that we used to Vine Street for large money drops. Now here's a list of everyone who did business there in the last six months. If you can think of anyone else, put them on that list. I want surveillance on everyone you can find, I want phone taps on the rest, I want it this afternoon. - It's already one o'clock. - This afternoon. - Yes sir. (tense music) (whispering) - Hey, you at the wrong place at the wrong time, Mr. Sharpe. (punching) (door banging) - Justin, is that you? - Let's not make this difficult this time. - Don't touch me. (ominous music) - Diana? Diana? Shit! - [Man] Look, you're a little buddy's dead. I will kill the bitch if you do not bring my money to me. Look, you fucking listen to me. I'm want you at the studio at 3:00 PM, do you understand? - I'll be there, three o'clock. And Rick, if you hurt the girl, I swear, if it's the last thing I do, I'll kill you. - So who's going on the meet? - Well, I think we'll take along a little insurance policy. I got a few friends in the business who get tired of pulling their punches. - Well, that's fine by me as long as I'm included. - You can locate that site? - No problem. - We've got them, Espo, we've got them. That dickless Rick Cooper, first he welshes on his bets and then he steals from me. - I should have slit his fucking Achilles when I had the chance. - Yes, you should have, but not to worry. All's well that ends well. Tomorrow he's going to kill his partner and then we're going to kill him and anyone else unfortunate enough to be there. Don't forget, you must to get that video tape to the cops. - What for? Oh Espo, once they find the bodies it will help them tie it all together. A terrible tale of criminal betrayal. - But what are they gonna think when there's no money? - Money, what money? I never claimed I lost any money. Besides, even if Detective Willis thinks there was money he'll figure one of those morons stashed it. No, no, no. If the cash doesn't have some insurance companies screaming after it, the cops will get the lazy and leave it alone. (glasses clinking) Tomorrow, you and I shall reinvent pain. - Sweet. (tense music) (engine revving) - Bravo, Mr. Sharpe. It's to your credit a punk like you made it this far. - Alright Rick, cut the shit, alright? Just give me the girl. - Where's my money? Shut that bitch up in there! Get my fucking money. Yeah! - Toss it over here. - Just calm down. You told me to show you the money. - Toss me the bag! - Alright, just calm down. (gun shooting) - No fucking money in the bag! - No, no, no! That motherfucker does not leave here alive! (guns shooting) Fucking bitch, shut the hell up! (speaker muffled) You are one hell cat, I'll tell you that. If we had met under different circumstances, I could learn to love you. Jesus fucking Christ. You just stay here, baby, because you're bait, and when your little friend Justin shows up, he's a fucking dead man. But I'm not gonna leave you here too long. No, I'll come back for you, I promise. And if I don't, I'll send my boys, I promise, baby. Au revoir. (guns shooting) (grenade exploding) (speaker voice muffled) - Okay. - This is as far as you go. (exploding) (Justin screaming) - Oh shit. (grenade exploding) (exploding) (men screaming) (punching) - Suck on this, sucker. (exploding) Sucker. (tense music) Shit. (men shouting) - Hey you! (speaking in foreign language) (man grunting) (guns shooting) (exploding) (phone ringing) - Willis. Yeah. Shit. Any units in the area? Okay, yeah, we're about 12 minutes away from there. Yeah, yeah, okay, right. - Who was it? - That was your boy Briggs, he said some shit's going down at the warehouse. - Want your burger? You know where this place is? - Yeah, it's the old warehouse, we've made a few busts there. Cocaine. - Think it's our boy? - Bombs, destruction, bullets going off, oh yeah, that's him. We gotta get there first. - Death and destruction, I'm with it. You sure you don't want your burger? - Mr. Watson, sorry to wake you, but it's time to pull a little Cain and Abel on your ass. (gun shooting) - Psst. - Justin, help me. - Alright, just stay there, I'm coming, stay there. (ominous music) - Sounds like all kinds of hell is breaking loose in there. - Sounds like something's going on in there. - You ready? - I told you, I'm not afraid to die. - You should be. (grunting) (punching) (guns shooting) - You son of a bitch! - You alright, you alright? - Yeah. Wait, wait, come on, we gotta go, we gotta go. - I'll shoot 'em when I get back. (tense music) - [Justin] Let her go. - I don't think so. - Diana, are you okay? - Oh, I assure you she's quite fine. Not as good as she used to be, but then again her taste used to be better as well. Did you bring my money? I thought this might happen. So I invited some friends of mine along to act as personal arbitrators. (men vocalizing) (intense music) (suspenseful music) (explosive firing) - Damn man, you alright? Get up man, go! You alright, man? (guns shooting) I'll call for some backup. (speaker voice muffled) You alright? - See you later, sucker! Justin, Justin, Justin! - Fucking bitch. Fucking little bitch. (gun shooting) - Had enough, Mr. Sharpe? - I can't believe I got dropped by a beautiful woman. - Believe it. (wall smashing) - Well now that the preliminaries are over we can get to the main event. - Hey man, I just wanna know why did you do this to me? - I'll tell you why. You come, you try and take over my movie, you didn't know your place and I thought I'd show it to you. - I mean you had me kill people, like it was a movie or something. - Yeah, well you were one gullible son of a bitch. You know, I needed your limited skills and the fact you were unknown, those guys didn't even know what hit 'em. Fucking Watson thinks he's so fucking smart. I took him down, baby. And with a punk like you. Think you were good with those amateurs? Well now you get the master. You think you can deal with me, Sharpe? You never fucking dealt with anybody like me before. That's why I had you fired and rehired and fired again. - We'll see, motherfucker. (speaker voice muffled) - You like the taste of that, do ya, huh? There's plenty more where that came from, baby. Come on, come on, come on. - That was good, man, that was good. But play time's over, baby. (Rick shouting) (intense music) - Mr. Sharpe, how you doing? You know, I got a few friends I brought along. I hope you don't mind. You know, this has been the best day of my life. First of all, I got to kill my boss today. Felt real good, he was a prick. Then I found the money. Now I've got the girl. The only thing that's gonna make me happier is when they kill you. Oh, by the way, before I did kill the boss he told me to get this little son of a bitch. I'm talking to you, back up! And the last thing the boss told me to do was kill you. I got the money, I really don't have to, but I like following orders. (mumbling) - Fuck Watson, you can keep the money. I'll put you in my next picture, man. - All good, but I don't work with B-grade actors. (gun shooting) After you kill that sorry, Mr. Sharpe, I'm sorry, Mr. Sharpe. Be sure and make it look like he killed that lousy no good actor. You don't mind that, do you? Oh, what a present. Let me tell you what, this is a wonderful day. Say goodbye to her, kill the bastard. - Got it, boss. - Which one of us? Which one of us is gonna take him out? - Luke, you go ahead, you take him out. - What you say my name for, man? - Just take him out, Luke. - Quit saying my name! (shouting) - You take him out. - How about I take all of us out, motherfuckers? - Bullshit, he ain't gonna do it. He ain't gonna do it. - He's not gonna do it. - Fuck it. - The hell you doing! (grenade exploding) - Oh man, you just ruined a perfectly good day. Little fucker! (men kicking) (siren wailing) - [Cop] Freeze, Justin! Don't do it. We know you're innocent. We saw the tape. (laughing) (police radio chattering) (upbeat music) (lyrics muffled)
