Definitely not! It's up to me to be jealous! Very well... and very relaxed No tension One hour, I think I am very well, Margarita A weapon in a show?

And so the night, won't feel so lonely... you will remember... our happy days together... you will remember... the taste of my kisses... And you will understand... all at once... the meaning... of a year of love. And you will understand... all at once... the meaning... of a year of love... Did I annoy you? Why? The imitation... It flatters me and makes me feel young Let me look at you Close up, you don't look like me, but they are my gestures I have copied your style, what makes you unique I used to be like that but I changed I cannot sing pop any more I became a lady of song I know, but I like the old stuff: the twist, the miniskirt, your spirit, your style I don't know whether to be charmed or insulted Charmed! Wonderful! Forget it, Manuel! By the way, Letal, this is my husband. Ah, it is you. Enchanted So what is your real name? As the song says... Call me what you like.

Manuel, this guy is harmless! Rebecca never misses an chance to humiliate me She recons she has reasons to be jealous, doesn't she? You know me. You haven't changed! You neither And I'm delighted I've changed It doesn't show, but I've matured Does it remind you of anything, this song? Too many things... We didn't finish either of them, eh? How dare you, Manuel? You insult me! You never were a conventional woman What sort of woman was I? A marvelous woman For 50 years, I have been a marvelous woman I want to be a marvelous person Who says different? I am the mother of your wife Not for a long time I will divorce Rebecca Does she know? But she doesn't show it Pass the lip gloss Anything else? Yes, the combs Put them in the bag Help me with my zip? You must struggle with that To be beautiful, one must suffer! I suffer as much without being beautiful!

Help me with my stockings? Hold on... A beauty spot on your nipple! It's a birthmark... My dress! Let go Help me, with my heels I could break my ankle Open your legs and... you'll get down easier Leave me alone! What? - Open up - What? Letal, what are you saying? Don't tempt me... because it's four months since I... Why is she late? She is unpredictable She takes after me... Ah, what a cow! It was a dream... Thank you, it is true that I needed it... But it will not be repeated Why? Because I love my husband That monster? Yes, that monster I do not know your name, nor your address That can be arranged Here is my address Things are good this way... Really, don't complicate matters Shall we meet again? Who knows? I'll call you? No, I prefer to contact you Where? Here I will not be here any more Then, good luck Are you deaf or what? I am in a hurry I'm the one in a hurry, I'm a "working girl", me... You spoil her Poor bulls The notices, nothing interests me, the weather comes and goes... Ah, there it is... Pass the album... on Becky del Pramo... Yes, mum "Her first night in Madrid..." Are we talking about Bardot or Mother Teresa? No, only of Becky Thanks... you look pale, you wouldn't be sick too? We're both fine Who knows? With your careless attitude, you can fool anyone! Have you had an AIDS test? Do not start If you do not do it, I will... I am tired Give me those scissors... darling First you had leprosy, now AIDS! Do you know what gives you away? I know that I am burned out You do not move! Precisely, I need to get well Come on, give me the glue, don't look at me that way I have the right to know if I am HIV positive You, I don't know, but me, I cannot live without knowing Mum, where is it? On the tele, give it to me, go on... The test is at the hospital, you will have to get up, then you will find out One day you will regret your cruelty... and that day will come soon Becky has aged... Her daughter looks spooky Sancho Manuel's corpse is stretched out on the bed... showing signs of rigor mortis Hair dark chestnut Light chestnut Light chestnut He's about about 1.80m... A little less, 1,78m... More OK, 1.80m Dressed in red silk pajamas Satin Garnet-red satin He has two holes in the chest, made by a firearm... causing death According to the coroner, he died between 9 and 11 pm 3 women visited him One made love to him, One quarreled with him, The third found him dead Did one of you kill him? Not me Right, none of you I want to re-verify... your times of arrival... You, first... Yes At what time? At 8:30, and I left a little after 9 When, precisely? I don't record these things! You went there? Before the news, Manuel called me to ask me to drop in And you left? Yes He promised me a speaking part I'd had enough of deaf-mutes People think I'm like that, but as you see... What did you do? I said, we made love But Manual received a phone call... and asked me to leave... I don't like to be treated like that It was the 1st time? No... we did it... err... We won't listen... to the sexual exploits of this young lady We aren't talking about someone's love life, but of a man murdered a little after having made love Anyone else? Did you see anyone else around? We didn't speak... nor finish Very well You may go I'm going... This is bad publicity for me There will be no publicity Because I sing, I dance and I do jazz... to sleep with a man is one thing, to kill him is another... I will not trouble you any further You can, but understand that... I understand, goodbye It was you who called him to see him Yes I arrived just before 9:30 Why did you stop your rehearsal? I had to Why? It is hard to speak about it in front of my daughter, judge What I have to say is not new I did not kill him One does not kill one's son-in-law before a premiere! You believe me, Rebecca? You must convince the judge, not me Tell me what you spoke about I wanted us to break up You were lovers? Yes I wanted to put an end to that madness You knew? Do not lie! You knew it or you guessed it You said nothing to me and I do not like to imagine things I've nothing to do with the failure of your marriage Nobody's accusing you, now talk to the judge He's asking the questions Manuel seduced me, I let it happen Alas, I was always weak with men With some, anyway When I found out he was cheating on me too... I went to see him to break... Until when? I do not know any more... 10 perhaps The taxi will be able to confirm it He told us that you were upset Yes, Manuel had destroyed my life and that of my daughter! I would like to leave OK You can go You can call me at home... If it wasn't Becky, it happened afterwards Between 10 and 11 It wasn't her You are sure? Before a premiere, it would be bad business to kill someone Especially one's son-in-law... it's a good argument You said you arrived at 11 The sprinkler doesn't operate before then Your husband was alone in the house No-one else Why? There was a violent argument, in the morning He wanted a divorce and I had refused He threatened to leave me, and I to commit suicide He left? Yes, he wanted to be alone I promised to leave him - You went there? - Of course I returned after the news I was after my tranquillizers They were not in their place I supposed that Manuel had removed them... fearing I'd do something stupid Under this pretext, I went to see him Try... to describe accurately your arrival Remember... all that you saw, heard There was wind... in the leaves of the trees I can still hear the noise When I entered... it was dark, I did not want to show my tears to Manuel I sat in an armchair Manuel had his back to me I could not see well I asked him for forgiveness for the argument in the morning I said that I would grant him a divorce... that I would manage He did not answer I thought that he was angry I had decided to take my pills on the table I approached the bed I must have been blind not to see... I just thought he was angry... I cried because of his hardness I took the pills and I was going to leave... but I returned... I could not leave like that... Once on the bed, I rubbed myself against him, I cuddled him... but he did not react And then I realized... that my hands and dress were covered with blood Why wait until this morning? I really do not know What did you do? I went back to the house... I could not reconcile myself with his death And I don't give a damn about dying I swallowed a stomachful of pills... but I brought them up again at once... The morning, I called the police - for the photographs? - Yes Let us see, these are yours And these An armchair It is your armchair? Yes They are mine, they were mixed up This face looks familiar He was my fiance He disappeared, did you know him? You know where he is? Good evening Rebecca, my condolences Thank you Mine too Thank you We thought you'd take a holiday Work will distract me Of course... Rebecca! You are here! Eh yes, as you see The usual? No, more If you need anything, Rebecca Rebecca, I feel bad Don't I'm sorry and... It's not your problem... You don't have to worry OK, but I wanted to say it Be prepared What's she doing? Are you testing the sound? Yes Good evening. The Agricultural Demonstrations A great quantity of corn was thrown... by the farmers in front of the U.S. embassy It is the agricultural organization "PIENSO" that... organized this demonstration. Yes? Good evening... The Agricultural Demonstrations... Corn... this morning was thrown... How can she work? The agricultural organization "PIENSO"... demonstrates thus against American corn importation, because Spain is increasing its quotas This afternoon, Manuel Sancho Bermejo was buried, assassinated 3 days ago... between 9 and 11 in the evening, in his country house Dedicated as always to communication, he was directing TV7 at the time of its death Various celebrities from the show... as well as family and friends rendered a last homage to Manuel Forgive my familiarity... he directed this series and... was also my husband Cut, if... Manuel... had lately received death threats Unfortunately, he took no notice Prepare the next One day he asked me: If he gave me something, would I say it on TV7? I answered no Well Manual, here I am... I'm trying to do it Judge Dominguez is running the investigation... and is right off track at the moment According to the autopsy, the victim... had just made love... But it was not with me If you continue, I'm leaving At 11, this Thursday, I went over there... I found his corpse Wait! Do not cut! And I know who committed the crime It is I I killed him She killed him! Rebecca... Judge Dominguez... Go immediately to TV7 and arrest Rebecca Giner As for the gun... I had to throw it I do not remember too well Yes, I returned... and I was overcome I could not call anybody, nor knew what to do I was never going to see Manuel again... and that made me suffer dreadfully I don't know why, to fight this anguish, I started to photograph... our common memories: his office... with his papers, neatly arranged, his sports bag, His bed, His dressing gown, His cupboard with his costumes, His armchair from where he watched me on the TV... I even photographed some ravishing clothes that I had just bought... and now useless Then I realized that I was alone... and that while I had killed Manuel, I had not killed my love for him Madam... Come with us! Wait, I haven't finished That is all Remember... that at 20:30... in the 2nd edition of the News, you will see... the latest news in draft form As always, thank you for watching... and goodbye Sorry, Xavier... You have the right to remain silent... and not to incriminate yourself You have the right... to a lawyer You may inform whoever... of the fact and of the place of your detention Enter The next time, pay attention to the weapon Sit down Why not tell me? Why on television? So what? I admitted it, didn't I? That is not enough... It is not so easy to be guilty Proof is required Look for it! And you will help us If you decide to tell the truth! I have just done it When? You have two versions One here this morning, and one on television Which should I believe? Which is true? Both Both? This morning, you... were looking for pills... without mentioning the revolver... and that is significant The revolver was beside the pills, it was Manuel's What did you do with it? Come! Take off her handcuffs To help you, I need you To help me? Why? You had no need to kill him You had to only divorce... OK, let us suppose that you did not do it And these death threats? These anonymous messages? Manuel couldn't give a fuck Who was the author? Yes... Me Shit! Let us suppose that it was not you... Who could want his death? I do not see... Forgive me... you have a lover? Does that concern you? Yes, it is my inquiry No, I do not have one Never unfaithful? Never once? No! That's a lie Oh yeah? When your mother returned, to the Villa Rosa, you misled your husband right under his nose How do you know? Who are you trying to protect? Nobody Anything to add? OK, then, it is prison You can telephone You need clothes and... a lawyer... apart from anything else Good evening, Madrid It was hard to get here... but I am happy This evening, my only daughter sleeps in prison It little matters what she did, like all mothers, my heart is broken Allow me to dedicate to her my first song If your sorrow is heavy, think of me, if you want to cry, think of me You can clearly see... that I adore your divine face, your child's mouth... that taught me to sin... Think of me... when you suffer, when you cry, also think of me That's your mother, it is beautiful, isn't it? Stop Why? I cannot The poor thing Close your ears! Luisa! I'll buy it from you 10,000 pesetos It cost me 15000! 17,000, sorry I've just been robbed, I will give them to you tomorrow We will see tomorrow, then Sorry, but it is her's When you cry why... think of me When you want... to capture my life I do not want to any more It's nothing... it's no good for me... without you Hello, Paula will take you to the nursery Clotilde is sick Hello, Myriam My name is Paula, I am a welfare officer, I am here to help you We know each other... you remember?

I need sleeping pills... - sleeping pills? - Yes We'll see... You're concerned about Rebecca... so, I made inquires No point, mum I will speak to her mother She is hiding something That, I well know Look at that You recognize him? It's the dead man Formerly, he was the mother's lover Look, there... Who is that? Judge Dominguez Enter Astonished that I live in a basement? To tell the truth, yes My parents were in digs I was born here Why return so much later? It is difficult to say Thank you, put that there I ran out of time the 1st year And then 15 years passed... A little tea? Thank you... my mother knows the same type of inertia She's an artist? Something like that She is sorry about your daughter and your son-in-law When did you meet him? Who? Manuel... on your return? Yes I was invited to the wedding but I could not go Recognize anyone? That's despicable! Answer me Yes... I recognize us It's been a long time... Manuel made a living from the artists he interviewed... Me included You lied? I have the right to forget You speak like a guilty person I am not one You are thinking of your daughter? I am not thinking of anything I am suffering too much to think This will astonish you... I want to help you Help who? Not me... You are free Prison would not be worse... And if you want to help Rebecca... remember that she confessed I do not believe that she told everything She said enough! You could speak to her She will not lie you You're dreaming! You are not anxious for her? Of course I am! Why do you not want to see her? I neither want to speak to her, nor to reopen my wounds I could help you avoid bureaucracy... and go to the prison Thank you But I am afraid of Rebecca Fear of having to face her Every morning... my only desire is to get through to evening to do what I know how to do: to perform... I cannot do more OK, leave me alone I would like to keep the clipping I must return it... Leave! She is beautiful! She was arrested with me... She is a whore She tossed a brick at a cop to join her girlfriend She's got guts... Hang on, sleeping pills... You are stoned! Useless to shout it! I told you not to sell to her! Bitch! Shit, stop! I will kill you! Why did I almost kill this guy? Just to see you! Who's is this blouson? Mine of course Can I see something? Let go! You're lying I bought this for my boyfriend - It is mine - Yours? OK, you can keep it... but where did you get it? On a stiff, we shared out his stuff A dead man? Are you sure? The person I'm talking about, was a grass Hugo, a grass? He was a dealer, you weren't friendly with this son of whore? He was not a son of whore, leave me alone! Cool it Listen, look at this It is him? Yes - Sure? - He's bad news... - So? - Let me go What's happening? My boyfriend is dead I am sorry Is this him? She told you that? I bought him the red blouson If I were you, I would get more information We lived together just a few months He left time and again, like all junkies He was one? Yes I tried to help him Although I loved him, I wouldn't let him lie to me One day, I said to him: "just go!" He never returned And these photographs? From then on When I'm blue, I photograph what he left behind: The photographs... look, his cock A beauty spot on the nipple? Do not study his head... What counts, is the tail... And she told me he was a grass You believe it? Many junkies are, you know... And I remember... Hugo questioned me a lot about the prison Rebecca Giner, come to the gates Go ahead, Rebecca! Remove her handcuffs How is that? Ready to talk? About what? Letal, I must find him More jokes, Judge! He's your grass Untrue Who told you we'd fucked? Nobody else Tell me where he lives lives I've no idea I saw him at the Villa Rosa He never gave me his address One moment Go over there, I have a surprise for you Close the door The judge wanted us to talk Where are you going? I'm putting out my cigarette Why did you do it? I did not kill him! But you admitted it yourself To kill would have been reasonable, but it was impossible I was avenged by this false confession Why do I torture you? Because I slept with him? Exactly! Don't be stupid You were not the only one What? In The Autumn Sonata, a pianist has an untalented daughter Rather like us... The mother comes to see her daughter... who also plays the piano She asks her to play for her The girl is embarrassed, but ends up accepting and nervously plays some Chopin Her mother congratulates her for her performance, but cannot resist criticizing Nothing could be more humiliating for the girl For her mother says to her: you are lousy! How dare you play this sublime score? You think I would put up with this? You are too crude to copy my style Even if you wanted to you could not even be my understudy Your imitation is not a homage but an insult! What are you talking about? I always imitated you I always wanted to beat you Without ever succeeding, except once! With Manuel! - We were both losers there - Yes, but he married me, me! You wanted to prove to me that you could have him I knew it, but it was necessary that you knew it! Forgive Me, Rebecca I acted badly What can I do? You can listen to me Alright I've weighed you down from childhood... However, I tried to be useful... because I adored you The day when Alberto died... Yes... I heard you talking You were trapped, there was only one solution He took downers and uppers I swapped the tablets Yes, a moment He fell asleep at the wheel If I had not killed him, he would have refused you a divorce... and you would not have sung, nor made films, nor loved I wanted to set you free... You had promised me to share everything... but you did not keep your promise... I will never forgive you... Here, Miss Who is it? Rebecca, listen That's it, she is throwing up... She's eaten nothing Alright? Shall we take her to the infirmary? Let's take her... Come, Rebecca... It is nothing, you are pregnant... Pregnant? Impossible! Yes, the tests prove it... You'll have to take better care of yourself, to eat more, not to smoke, to live a healthy life, without drugs... and without drink For the rest, be happy, all is well What now? Lead a healthy life and wait... Attention... Rebecca Giner please go to the visiting room I repeat Rebecca Giner is awaited in the visiting room Well, Rebecca! It is you being called on the loudspeaker! Go! Who are you? A legal agent I have your release Certificate of release Then I am free? Yes I do not have a pen Here, sign What do I have to do? The governor has signed, get your things... Good luck Thank you - Yes? - It is Judge Dominguez I have just rung you at home, without success... The bell frightened me In the prison, I was told that you are pregnant On the level, eh? It's true, OK? I'll come up No, not now... Tomorrow I'll come up immediately, just a moment Sorry, I have to shake you down I thought you would You're not here to guard me? I'm after Letal... He's at Villa Rosa this evening Who told you? He telephoned me at the office What a stroke of luck! I get out, he shows up Being pregnant Sometimes things happen like this Shall we sit? With pleasure Why? It was his armchair Here, can I? Letal wants to see you this evening Why? He must want to speak to you You too I imagine You imagine wrongly I have nothing to say to him And nothing he has to say, could interest me Will you go? Me, I'm going It interests me to listen to him And you deny he's your grass? How aggressive you are! Without me, you'd be rotting in prison! Perhaps I should thank you? I believed that you had released me because you thought me innocent Sometimes I doubt it You've never told me you are I am innocent Why the TV business? I was desperate... I felt guilty... That might convince a psychiatrist, not me One can feel guilty without being it... Understand? Yes, but you I do not understand Me neither That makes two of us! Why help me? Why, if you doubt so much? Not your innocence That should be enough Well it isn't I would like to ask you so many questions But I do not have the right, even if I am the Judge We agree on that Yes I must go Goodbye Judge... You have a cigarette? It's bad to smoke True... you have a light? Excuse my... welcome, I was nervous Goodbye Mum, I am free Sorry about yesterday's scene I would like to see you tomorrow... to kiss you and tell you I love you I adore you as always... Your little Rebecca My child... If your sorrow is heavy, think of me If you want to cry, think of me You can easily see... that I worship your divine face... your child's mouth... that taught me to sin Letal! I'm just coming! Thank you for coming You! The Judge too? Yes Can you explain all this? That's what I'm here for... and to ask you to marry me Marry whom? Hugo, Letal, the Judge, who? All 3 The police are investigating, but... I have created a character to unravel one of my cases That's gone, I started again I invented my clean... informers... It is true? Yes... also true that you're expecting my child Ah yes? You did not screw Manuel I was able to lie to you, I too can lie I know If the child were not mine, you'd have gone to see your mother, not me - Give me - Hold What was Letal after? He worked on the assassination of a transvestite, but I did not find anything In short yes, you My mother's warehouse: my den What a brothel! You are the 1st person I've brought here... Oh, Rebecca Do we fight or do I put on my beard? Put on your beard... The state my head is in... Relax... Don't I'm taking off my sweater to put on the beard... You put it on at your mother's? Of course She suspects? No, she is insane and never leaves her room What a family! How can you lie to everyone? Everyone, except you and me And those you leave behind...? Paula, who fell in love with your character Now, there's just me Letal has explained everything to you today How can I believe you? How do I know you're not a murderer? And you, that you are not a queer or a junkie? Let's not complicate life with that We are imperfect With this confession, you could destroy me I do not want to Marry me, then! You're crazy! It must be settled now, we have started a family Letal, don't confuse me more I am called Eduardo I have to get married and I have only just learned your name Oh yes This song always makes me cry It is beautiful Becky del Paramo has just been rushed to hospital, following an infarction... at the theater where she was playing successfully... According to Dr. Tavora, the artist suffers... with angina that she hid... Rebecca, at last... What? She's unwell, she asked for you Do not speak to her too much I am the Judge Sit down Rebecca, come her My daughter At last you are free! For lack of evidence Protect yourself! But to me, you owe the truth Tell me the truth I do not want to die in ignorance I killed him You are not the only culprit Do not say that Why keep your illness hidden? That would have been blackmail It is as if I had killed you too Don't feel more guilty, one is enough Listen... Tell the Judge to come in Why? I must speak to him She wants... Forgive me, I was called Yes, Father Enter, please Come closer, Judge There is little time I wanted to tell you You were right I killed Manuel Rebecca confessed to protect me But it was me I knew it And how? With his revolver But no more details There is no time I need proof What more proof do you need?... I am square with human justice, there remains that of God Rebecca, call the priest Yes, mum Do not cry any more, daughter She wants to confess It is madness! It is natural to want to confess What can I say? My last confession was a long time ago The introduction is a little long, in fact I believe that this will be enough No confession since when? I was a child Let's do it like when you were child Holy Mary... Conceived without sin I confess to all that I have lied I admitted I killed my son-in-law and that is false It was not me Why lie? To save my daughter If your daughter committed so serious a crime... it is up to God to save her, not you I am her mother, God will understand My life was no use to her My death will do her some good You repent your lie? No I am glad to have done it Your intention is good... but for God to exonerate you, you must repent I repent all the misfortune that I have caused Tell me all Don't be morbid No, my daughter... but the Judge is not very convinced, I fear he will question me OK Let us see When I arrived, Manuel was sleeping How could he sleep after my visit? Nevertheless, he slept My pills were beside his revolver The noise of the drawer awoke him I asked him how he preferred I commit suicide... A bullet or an overdose? And then? He said he couldn't give a fuck Ah, men! We started to argue Tell me the worst, he will ask The distance when you fired... on which side of the bed he fell... I do not want to be short on detail Do not worry, I will tell you all Do not tire yourself Listen... I decided to kill myself, when Manuel dared me... Then, I lost my temper and I fired not at me but at him He fell... but I could not look at, his surprised expression... and I turned him over towards the right But, in spite of his bad treatment of us... I was sad... because nobody deserves to die like that You must learn how to manage your problems with men better Yes, mum Teach me Never mind, I'll go - Well? - The same Rebecca I must speak to you First, I must see her She's waiting for you Put the bag in her room I am leaving the case I will ask for another But it is solved! I am too involved... This nightmare will never end I do not have any evidence against her... And now is not the time I will give you, evidence, myself Mum, I brought my things That's good We're living together again And the revolver? I have it there Give it to me Mum, are you sure you want to do this? Yes Not like this I did it like this Thank you Open the windows I want to see the street As a child, when we lived together... I could not get to sleep without hearing your heels... far away... fading away in the corridor, after you had passed to see me It didn't matter how late... I stayed awake... for the sound of your heels...
