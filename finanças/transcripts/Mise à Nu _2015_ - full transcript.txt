Well, I wouldn't say my penis is beautiful, I wouldn't describe it like that. but I would say my penis is good-looking. People judge others whether it is by their face or their penis It's like the nose, there are all kinds of noses and all kinds of penises. I can't see myself comparing my soft penis with another man's penis. It's not the size of your penis when it is soft. Does your penis curve when erect? For me, the size of your penis provides one with confidence The man dropped his towel, and I went eww Exposure - The penis The penis. The elephant in the room, unmistakable like the nose in the middle of the face but subject to so much taboo. Between seeds, zizi, or bizoune, it is even difficult to call it by its name. A source of worry, questioning or confirming his supposed manhood depending on whether he is an inch taller or shorter than average. He's man's best friend, the one with whom he shares so much but rarely speaks about. It comes in a wide variety of sizes and shapes, from the small bloated to the tall slender. Just trying to describe it you quickly realize that penises are like snowflakes, there are no two alike. Yes, I love my penis. I'm happy with my penis actually it's not bad. It's the part of my body that gets more compliments so in general I'm comfortable with it. Circumference, a little larger than average, length 6 inches when erect, so I think that?s average Obviously when not erect, it varies enormously there, from almost invisible to very long. It can be so different. So my penis when soft, he's quite embarrassed when he doesn't recognize anyone. But when he is erect, that's where his real beauty shows. Then that's where it gives me a confidence boost because I'm very proud of my penis in full erection. Then it makes my shoulders more straighter, and makes my coat a little higher, it makes me feel like a man. Length, 5 and a half inches. I am uncircumcised and colored bronze outside. yeah, I could describe it like that. Well, when he's erect he's rosy like the skin. And then he is right. And then it's width is of most penis and about its length is longer. My penis tends to the left, it is a little bit on the left side of my testicle. I would say that at base there is hair, a stunted trunk, kind of small. it's a little wider, at the base then becomes thin like a nose? With too much skin around it and getting more as he gets older My testicles is like an explorer of a new world going further and further. I'm scared for my old age, I feel like I have a snorkel, you know? Describe my penis? I geberally have a sense of it being there. There it is. When it's idle, you don't know it is there, but it really has an intensity when it's on, an indicator of how I'm feeling. I like its color. Rosy pink, a little purple. I find it's form well rounded, very penetrating. Very strong veins, good blood circulation in this region, so yeah. So that's my penis. Describe my penis, OK. Well, first of all, this is not a description but I like it. I find it beautiful. I say it as it is. I think he is within the norm in terms of length, size, color. I'm not super equipped, nor an under equipped, it's efficient, it works well, it does what it has to do. Yeah, that's how I would describe him. Listen, in a Tunisian Jewish family like the one I belonged to when I was young, of course, the penis is something we never discussed. We never talked about it, we called it the zizi eh, or the zazoo. Besides, a Tunisian Jew, never the word penis. I learned the word penis much later when I arrived in Quebec. Well more as an adult, I would say, and so it's something we obviously never talked about neither penis, women, nor vagina nor anything at all. It was really a matter of scandal. For example, finally to show is a buttock was outrageous. I find that I have an average penis and in fact, the only possible verification is in relation to the number of sexual relationships that I have had with men different where I could see that he was average, at least among my partners. I have a height in the average size, apparently in the average, I would say that I am not in the best position to make the comparison, but it is my past experiences with my spouses that have confirmed it to me that reassured me. Don't worry, Martin? You're average, right? It's good. Already there, it is a thing of. Very reassuring. I find that now, yeah, my penis I find him to be well proportioned he's not too big, he's not too small and like it follows well. I find that we can and follow well and I find it well proportioned. I love it, I love it, I love the shape. Like a foot. Then it's, I'll write it to that, it's true, it's veiny penis seems to me, I see my veins for say I confess to you and you say that your penis GOOD ? My size? I find it a bit big in the center In the sense that is rightly seen that I am circumcised. There is like. This is a real case. His place in the world? Nicolas Lafleur, 42, film producer. Well I would say I think I have a standard size. I thought for a long time that I had a little penis. But no, people reassure me. I have a normal, good, working penis. I'm happy with that. On the other hand, when we compare ourselves in the industry versus comparing ourselves to the general population? In the general population I have a perfectly normal sized penis. But in the industry, it's one of the smaller ones. My penis is correct for my penis. I like my penis all the same. I mean, he does his job, he's okay, it's not hey that's huge or hee hee that's small? It's good, I have a penis, I'm happy in my heart. I appreciate my penis as a person. Any man will tell you, the penis often does as he pleases when he decides to stretch at the wrong time or to go to bed when we would like him to show up in all its glory, it can cause a lot of trouble for its owner. The erection comes quite early in the boys who react with surprise, exploration and pleasure and must learn to handle the indomitable beast as best as possible. I can't say the exact age, but I know it's in infancy, perhaps 5, 6 or 7 years. I remember it happening in the bath. He was starting to play with that with a smile. It's funny, I think. I never spoke about it. I'm not circumcised, so when I pulled on the foreskin, then the water was hot, you have fun. At night, gradually at first, I started to play with my penis but nothing came out. I didn't feel so worried at first. What worried me, it's funny looking back, is I thought a erect penis had to be straight. I didn't think it was angled. I thought I had a problem with my penis. I was scared for years. I started too around those ages. I remember we were talking about it. We had older friends asking have you already started touching yourself? No, no no, no, I don't want to. Not me, that is disgusting. But eventually, I did too, I think it was in 3rd year, around 9 - 10 years old. At a very young age when I had just learned to shake my penis like any good little boy should do, I think I was 3 or 4 years old, I suddenly felt a pleasant sensation and after a while, I reached orgasm. And it was so violent, huh? A sort of jerky shock that kept coming back. Which, for me, was completely new that at some point I was like even scared. But the same evening, after having told this strange adventure to my father, he quite simply said to me, not to do it So there you have it, I realized that it was better not to talk about it. And keep that to yourself. I must have been 7 or 8 with other little kids my age in a hayloft. I have a memory of that summer in the hayloft of lying side by side. There were 5 of us. We had fun playing with our our penis, that is to say with our own penis. And then we started to play with the penises of our little comrades. So it was the first time that I felt such a zone of pleasure, but above all there was great happiness in the transgression of doing something completely forbidden. I was on my basement single bed. Condoms had been bought and I started to play with the condom, then motion. I didn't really know, then there, at some point, I must have been lucky, I had the right movement with my hands. And then the orgasm came. And then I remember saying out loud: What is this? We now know that they will not become deaf, but if it is more accepted than before and still practiced as abundantly, mastubrating remains a personal adventure that we avoid advertising. This perhaps explains why the first ejaculation often surprises budding boys in search of new sensations, leaving in his mind an unforgettable memory. Well, I heard mastubation makes you deaf when I was raised. I wasn't raised in Quebec in the 0-15 years. There, no, it was. I heard a lot of urban legends about masturbating. I even had a friend my age, that suprisingly believd them. Then today, I see that it comes from his parents, they said, you waste children. It's sperm, you're wasting kids when you do that. In the 19th century, the medical theory in vogue, you came into the world with a set quantity of sperm. So if you masturbated, you spent it, you emptied yourself. At some point, you became weak and not only that, but the more you used it, the more your ejaculation stopped being strong and so if you wanted to have children, you shouldn't be masturbating. As I had no idea, I wondered if it was not a disease or an infection or it worried me a little bit, but on the other hand, as there was pleasure that was connected to it, I said to myself to I don't know what it is. But in any case, it brings pleasure so it should not be so bad and doesn't have to be a disease. The sensation or these whitish liquids? I didn't really know what it meant and why it came every time and I don't really know what to do with it. No one had told me that you had to take a small towel to wipe yourself off. I was just there with that and, let's say a little naive. For me, it was like the, the starting of being a man, of being a real teenager, of everything happened, I had no porn, but I could not stop or back off. That afternoon my parents were gone, then I was right in the middle of the living room, then I hope my parents don't cost it someday. But I called my guys from the living room, then it was okay, then it was fun, then it felt like there was something different, a different feeling, then it was fun. Then it was like. A stress, it was. Like a suspense then suddenly, it was like the most beautiful ejaculation of my life. At that time, I picked up the phone, I called my best friend, me too, me too, it's literally coming, it's coming. And I came. Yeah, I was 14 and a half, that was before I went to play a soccer game. And then there was a report on TV. And then there were models parading in their underwear and then there, instinctively, I put my hand in the pants. I started to touch myself. And then I said, Oh, but that's nice. And then I continued. And then there I had my first ejaculation and then I said wow, that's great. And then afterwards, when I arrived at Soccer, I told everyone it's crazy. I was proud and everything. I remember it as if it was yesterday. It took like a little while before I thought that was my first ejaculation. Then for real, I thought in my bed, I stayed tense for a good 10 minutes how if I was going to be able to resume life afterwards. How often do you masturbate? Frequency? Same frequency, it was constant, it was like every time I could between school in class, when I arrived home, when there was no one around when I could fit it in, it was done. But it is sure that there you are 12 years old at the beginning not. I think that precisely you discover when you discover Ben. It's okay, it's Fun, but it adds to your life, but when you spice up your life with it It's made Fun. Well look, I think that's how all the boys are, it's everywhere anytime. During adolescence, it's a little complex in the background, my penis in masturbation. I had a curve to the left and then, when I was 12-15, I was masturbating so much I thought. It was me who broke it and gave it a curve. In fact, it might be possible. Does masturbation create a curved penis? It is necessary to see that how the individual is masturbating. There are men who think that their penis is an iron rod and then they can do anything with it it's not true, you can get hurt during masturbation, there are people or men in fact who will try to bend or force a certain angulation at the level of the penis. It's not a fracture, but they can still create microtraumas, in fact It's a scar. Which will cause the penis to bend on the side of the fracture. Usually, we will recommend following the anatomical curve to avoid getting hurt. Exposure The 2 generally make a pair like Abbott and Costello, Laurel and Hardy or Batman and Robin, some testicles must resolve to go it alone. with Cryptorchidism, either the absence of one or two testicles in the scrotum, affects a little less than 5% of male newborns, but almost a third of premature babies. If this condition increases the risk of infertility, there are still many dads who have managed to make a beautiful and large family using only half of their paraphernalia. I had been traumatized at 10 because I was a guy a little older than me and I ejaulcated double. At some point, he asks me the question, how did you do that? Well I said, I have 2. Yeah, he said I have two too. Ah OK, are you scaring me? What I didn't know but why are you asking me these questions? Well, it's because he says the older you get, the more you have. Oh yeah, it's true, my father, he's 95. His father was Italian, then there I imagine him. Ah yes, Ah yes, ok I'm writing this for a long time, me for about 2 years, then I was sure there, then once in a while again. 2 then yeah. The time I met 3 in the same place, that struck me because we weren't even naked yet. We kissed, then it's like Hands, that's right, then he. There was no word, he said, it's just my hands touched his bag, I felt 3 testicles. Then he looked at me and said. Me, I was born with the testicle in my stomach, so one didn't descend as normally suppose to do, I have one who descended all the way. At some point, I heard about that there were 2, then there I was. Yeah, it's funny because I only have one. And then I talked to my parents about it. Finally, that was it, I had one in my stomach. And so at age 7-8, telling me listen, don't worry because it's not going to develop normally. Indeed, it is so very small compared to the other and also tell me that it may be of a certain age. My body was perhaps going to reject it, it was going to turn into a cancer and that it's a simple operation to remove it. I was around 4 years old. It was in the bath because I had cancer when I was 4 years old, then the only memory, when did I really pay attention to my erogenous zone? It was at 4 years old in the bath and I noticed my right testicle, which was really bigger than the left. It was after the size of a golf ball. That's how I knew I had cancer at 4 years old. In short, it was the beginning of a great adventure with my testicles, with the lower part of my body in fact linked to sexuality which led me precisely to cancer treatment. He rolls, he rolls here in fact there, there he goes inside like that then. They'll-they'll get the testicle. They come out that way, then they come to cut, then there you go. On the one hand, we are lucky, we have 2 testicles. 2 are normal at the base But if one has a health problem, like cancer, it can be removed. The other will compensate because the testicle has 2 functions, a hormonal function which could produce testosterone. That's never limited me in my sexuality, it never limited me in my relationships, but it brought me closer to my sexuality, in a sense that was softer than most. You know because already I'm a relatively manly guy, you know I can't imagine having one more testicle with more testosterone in my body. There you know it's like I Feel good like that. The other aspect is the fertility aspect. There is with a testicle, one can easily be fertile. The only problem is that sometimes there are a lot of studies. Who have demonstrated that. Young people who have testicular cancer often also have an abnormality in their fertility. So it's not the fact that we removed the testicle that will reduce their fertility, it's that it was already reduced. One testicle has to provide for the 2 so he runs out of steam faster and at the age of 25 when I knew that so I went. Do a test. Just to let me know a little bit about where I was in my fertility in the face of that and I was indeed sterile, already, at the age of 25, in terms of fertility, one testicle, the doctor said it backwards, when I was little, that it wasn't going to bother to function, It happened before puberty. So my remaining testicle. He works, he compensates, then I do fertility tests at 18, but I didn't get a phone call back from the doctor so I thought to myself that's okay, I'm just asking if it works. In Quebec, it seems that I am fertile according to the current study. But yes, of course I found that a bit of a shame. I would have liked to perhaps actually live a family life with my own children, my genetics. Someone with my past, my baggage, my fears and all those things, my child who finally teaches me to be myself, to discover myself through him. Okay so no, I wouldn't have that lifestyle. There, but all the same it brought me to another life that I really like. I really like children, I look at my brother, there are 3 of them, I look at friends all that, but I thought to myself there are a lot of single mothers today, maybe it was going to be. It may eventually become a father From my new spouse who has children. Exposure A standard penis measures how many inches? This is the eternal question, the vast majority of men have a penis everything. It's normal however, how many of these gentlemen suffer from the syndrome of the locker room, worried that their little bird is a little too short of the beak, the length of the penis is important for the men. While most women claim loud and clear that size doesn't matter to reassure the anxious Some candidly admit to prefer larger sizes. A penis at rest, that is to say who is not in erection, which is the majority of the time for a man, The length will vary in 8 - 10 cm and I would say that the circumference will also be approximately 8 to 10 cm in an erect penis. The majority of men have a length between 12 and 15 cm and the same thing for the circumference, it is very very close to each other I would say. We can have circumferences a little smaller, but in terms of length it is the average. I was watching a TV show the other day and we were shown a picture of Henry VIII, King of England, around 1515-1550. And presto, clearly and loudly in the middle of his body, where he wears in his groin area was to show that he was fertile. So he was empowered to lead the country because he was strong and he was powerful. England is powerful and strong Then an event that happened when I was in primary school, so I was in Tunisia. I don't know how old maybe 7 years old, 8 years old and all the children had to pass the doctor who had come to 'school. And then, all of a sudden, when he gets to me, he starts touching my stomach and asked where is your penis? I don't understand his question and the nurse comes over too Madame Demoiselle are both looking then he says Oh well, it doesn't matter, you will grow up. I never heard of anything again. I don't know at all what he was talking about, but I always had this kind of complex I'm not normal, I'm not like the others. I have a small one. To make a porn film is not necessarily a number one criterion. On the contrary even, I would say absolutely it's it's, it's more like Oh, we're going to have to be careful. For what ? Because for the difficulties that we know for men to concentrate, then to have an erection. A big penis, which is half erect, is worth next to nothing for the rest of us, whereas a penis, let's say more of average size, takes less blood, therefore easier to have a fast, solid and durable erection. I've never seen a patient who complained or I wouldn't say never, but the majority of men don't complain if it's too long or too big, it can happen. There are a few exceptions, usually men always complain that it is not enough. Curiously, with women, if we do a survey, 85% are satisfied with the length of their spouse's penis, while only 55% of men are really satisfied with the length of theirs. Penis length is not really important to me. Honestly, he has to know how to use it. You know basically, it's if there's a small one, then it's using it so much. But often, I like a little worker better than a fat lazy one. The adage is that size doesn't matter, it's how you use it. I find that yes, it's true, but there is nevertheless a certain limit, the majority of my orgasms come from the size - Do I feel it or not? I have less pleasure than when he is more present, let's say. It's not the same for all women, I agree. Fine, but as far as I'm concerned, size is just not that important. Personally, I think I've known all the colors and all the sizes. For me, it doesn't make a difference. I will be fine with it. All are fine. It's difficult for those who are in the middle. Because those who have a little penis, it's clear and obvious. Those who have a very big penis, it's very clear and obvious too. They don't even have to ask the question. So I'm like average, so I wonder how attractive I am, but it depends on each of the women, actually. And it's only when I went to the Naturists center of Montalivet in France I was 72, around that time I realized that there are people of all kinds in nature, there are people and penises that are tall, short, fat, thin, anyway and so I felt normal here but it took all that time. So for me, I can say that really discovering my naked body in a naturist setting was a form of therapy and a form of liberation. It lasted me the member. We didn't do this together. At some point there, I think about. Yeah, I think we have. Already spoken to? It's sometimes we arrive. Then hey, you got me when I was, well at the beginning, when I wasn't doing it, I would advance it, I'll get it. He swears to me. Me, I do not know. I'll go see, yeah, that's it, that's it. The rounded rounded. 182-2 more. Yeah, that's it. It's little games in class, measure how much yours is. Wait, tonight I'm going to measure this during my solitary pleasures, so I measured mine when I was a teenager, so I'm guessing it hasn't grown too much since then, I think. Is the length of the penis related to ethnic origin? This is what sparks debate. Several sexologists say no A recent study by the University of Holster in Northern Ireland concluded that it is the Congolese at 18 cm who have the largest penises in the world, the last place being occupied by the Koreans. This is not to silence the rumor that colored men are the most spoiled by nature and Asians are the smallest in this area. But are these myths or facts? I haven't done any scientific studies on it, but it does seem obvious that in the African and Caribbean Community, and even in Latin America, have penises larger than whites in Western countries, and as a personal experience in Latin America, I often met guys who had penises much more imposing. I have a lot of Caucasian girl friends who exclusively date black boys. And then so I ask them the question, well then, well then, finally it's true, isn't it? Many confirmed saying yes, but the opposite is also. I saw some with really ridiculous little ones, so I couldn't know if he was in. So I think it's the same, it's also the myth to say all Asians have small penises. I don't know actually. But you know, we look on the Internet, it's like all research. Based on some photographs out of studies yes Asians tend to have a smaller penis than say a white or a black. But you know, you shouldn't, shouldn't draw generalities either because yes, it can be beautiful, it can be long, it can be small, but if you're not able to use it, your big penis, it is useless ranking. You know, there have been several studies that have not only tried to make connections with the cultural origin of the man, but also with the different anatomical parts and have compared the size of the ears, the size of the nose, the size of the fingers, of the toes. and there is no correlation between the length of these organs with the size of the penis. Exposure The perpetual quest for performance is at the very heart of many men's sexuality, If we believe the myth, any penis male should have solid erection and be able to maintain a good pace for long minutes before the ejaculation. However, life is not a myth and superheroes do not exist. Not to mention that experience shows that the more stress of performing is present, the more the performance leaves something to be desired. Being able to perform and deliver orgasms is quite important. It comes from my beliefs, it comes from what I've heard, but it's important for me that my spouse be satisfied. I really feel that. Did she reach 7th heaven? Her orgasming makes me feel good. Then I value myself, I get into it. At first you say Ah wait, you didn't have an orgasm? Ok, what can you do? Then obviously, the more questions you ask, the more you are thinking and trying, the less it's natural, the less it's fun, in the beginning I was the same, focused on performance. If I had no orgasm, then it was the end of the world. So at the beginning, it was very mechanical, you have to follow the formula. Then I would say I like it this way. Slower, are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. I know because he was so stressed asking. I remember him being stressed and how miserable the sex was then I was thinking, my God, I'm not sexy. He wants more than I have. So at the beginning I had doubts, then after that, I realised that he was putting so much pressure on himself. You know, performance anxiety. I asked how does it feel, I was there, it's okay, you're not an actor. Then that's not what I'm asking you to be either. I know when you're younger, often you want to show that you're in control, and then you want to be the pro at everything. of course, to show off. I think there are a lot of men who have been through this. Me, it took me to around the thirties to realise this. So, it happened to me for a while, until a girl said to me, Listen, you don't have to perform for me anyway. So here I am. So Claude, I said to myself, It's okay, it's authentic. And then I was open and truthful then. It was hard to not keep asking myself the big question of am I performing enough, are my performances scoring high enough? Is my penis going to follow my performance intentions, will I get erection failure? So sure yes, it's very worrying. So sometimes I am really there, in perfect harmony with my penis. It's fine until I get into my head, into my mind, that I start to ask myself questions or get afraid. Shit it starts, when you start to feel is it there, you start to say no, no, no no, no, you mustn't huh. We all know it, there it is, it's worse there. Around 50 years old I started to have this fear of losing erections so I checked every day, every day to make sure it continued to work. If I still managed with a partner, well that was good, that was good, but if I was alone, I sometimes was very scared about not getting erect I realized that it was just anxiety, at the time I'll tell myself it's normal, I just don't have a partner. But I realized at some point my anxiety about checking whether I can get erect or not I then understood more what was happening to me, I calmed down a bit on this frenzy of checking my erections. In sexuality, sometimes, we can try to show off We can try to. Ah, we would like to be the super man there and everything, But that's not a good way to think. It doesn't respect yourself or the other too. The girl who told me that, stirred me up. She told me I love you but I'm leaving, it's over. I often have a kind of performance anxiety as, basically, our most important sex organ is our brain. And then, when I start to think, Ah, I hope it goes well.I hope I will have an erection That can be like putting a spoke in the wheels, in the gears, these anxieties there to want to perform well. I can talk to myself about my loss of erection. When I'm anxious and then I feel like I'm going to lose my erection or the erection won't come easily, I say right away, I'm nervous. And then you just have to continue to act as if nothing had happened. Then at some point, you just have to let it go. It will pass in. One thing leads to another, I understood that the times when I find come too early, it was because I had too great a need to perform, so I put stress on it. So physiologically I was coming faster. But now, I've worked on it so I can even make love not coming at all, then it can last 1 hour, or it can last 5 min making love. But my goal is not to ejaculate. my goal is not to reach orgasm. My goal is just to explore with the other's body, with the other's energy, or even with myself. What's going on? It's so ridiculous,it's not fair to share something so beautiful. Yes, I think the orgsm is magnificent. It leaves us helpless, it goes through us.But beyond it, there are equally intimate things that we overlook when we focus on it. Then I think that as guys, we stay stuck for years Maybe it's also because of education, TV, pornography and all that, but it's like it's becoming an obligation. To give orgasm? The body is a formidable machine. But like all machines, it is not immune to the passage of time. We age, we lose strength, we lose flexibility, we lose stamina, we lose hair. It would be surprising and completely against nature if the orgasm did not follow this downward curve. Then perhaps the erection will occupy a less important place in sexuality. And for those who miss the good old days, it doesn't hurt to pop a little pill every now and then. I believe that we can have good sex relationships until very late in our lives. I've read stories of Mr & Mrs 80 and over who make love. So yeah, yeah, why not. I would like to define the truth because the truth. I have the impression that it is misunderstood that we imagine the truth, that it is. A big beard, a big muscular man, then. I don't feel like that's it. I think being truthful is. To live with your choices, then to convince them, to be convincing, then to try to live your ideas, then go through with it. Yes, because as you get older, the erection is less and less strong. Less hard, much shorter or even more difficult to really get up. And it's true that if it really becomes a problem for me, I won't hesitate. I will go and use these little blue pills to remedy this problem. It's disturbing for guys, this erection problem because we haven't developed nor have other abilities in terms of sexuality. It is still very genital, our sexuality, it really is. Quite stuck. I don't know how to work more on tenderness, on caresses than on being constantly focused on our erections I have a bit of this nostalgia for this adolescence when or of the beginning, of adulthood where it worked like that and there weren't many issues or need to ask too many questions for the machine to get going. So today, given my age, I consider myself lucky to still have a good sex life. There are a lot of men my age who don't have one. In my case, I have one life partner but obviously, the testosterone level is not the same at 65 as it is at 15, it's not the same thing at all, so the frequency is less. Funnily, while it can happen that the machine is not always in perfect condition, the same thing can happen on the women's side too. So I think, well, I'm okay. Let's take it with humour as an off day. Does anything worries me on the physical side of sex? Alone I say to myself, I want to have one of the best sex lives that I know, that I have ever read in literature, in music, heard in movies that I can imagine myself. So once I have this I can really relax And then say I lived, I did what I had to do, I slept with whom I had slept then. I can really reflect on my good memories, in the movies that I recorded on my other smart phone or in photos? So on for those good memories, I can't wait. When I'm having sex, I feel manly, I know that myself, it makes me feel like a man. During sex, it's just more animal, it's a side that's more bestial, isn't it? It makes me alive, and when I don't have that anymore, I'll start to think how am I'm going to find more. It's important part of my life, yeah, I can't deny it. When you get up in the morning, when your prince says hello, yeah, it reminds you that you are a man, right? It's your working tool, right? My truth, it is really related to my sexuality. I think I would be able to feel very masculine even if something happened to me, and I have no more manhood, say get my penis cut off. If I have an accident, I don't think I'll lose any masculinity, nothing that really matters. It's obvious, male identities do not pass through the penis. There are penises of all kinds, of all lengths, all sizes, all shapes, whatever you want, some go to the left, others to the right. Anyway, I've seen thousands, thousands. People pay so much attention to it. It's like the nose, though. There are all kinds of noses, there are all kinds of penis, there you go. Lots of different are all healthy, some soft, firm, droopy, small, large. Exposure Breasts - next week on Canal Vie. (Translated into English by Andrew Chua)
