(Church bell tolls) It seemed that out of battle I escaped Down some profound dull tunnel Long since scooped through granites which titanic wars had groined Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred Then, as I probed them One sprang up And stared with piteous recognition in fixed eyes Lifting distressful hands, as if to bless And by his smile I knew that sullen hall By his dead smile I knew we stood in Hell With a thousand pains that vision's face was grained Yet no blood reached there from the upper ground And no guns thumped, or down the flues made moan "Strange friend," I said "Here is no cause to mourn" "None," said the other "Save the undone years, the hopelessness" Whatever hope is yours, was my life also I went hunting wild after the wildest beauty in the world Which lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair But mocks the steady running of the hour And if it grieves, grieves richlier than here For by my glee might many men have laughed And of my weeping something had been left Which must die now I mean the truth untold The pity of war The pity war distilled - [music] Requiem - [music] Requiem - [music] Requiem aeternam - [music] Requiem aeternam - [music] Requiem - [music] Requiem - [music] Requiem aeternam - [music] Requiem aeternam [music] Requiem aeternam - [music] Requiem aeternam dona eis - [music] Requiem aeternam dona eis - [music] Requiem aeternam dona eis - [music] Requiem aeternam dona eis - [music] Dona eis, Domine - [music] Dona eis, Domine - [music] Dona eis, Domine - [music] Dona eis, Domine ([music] Music over audio) - [music] Et lux perpetua - [music] Et lux perpetua - [music] Et lux perpetua - [music] Et lux perpetua - [music] Luceat eis - [music] Luceat eis - [music] Luceat eis - [music] Luceat eis [music] Requiem aeternam [music] Dona eis, Domine [music] Requiem aeternam [music] Dona eis [music] Te decet hymnus [music] Hymnus, Deus in Sion [music] Te decet hymnus [music] Hymnus, Deus in Sion [music] Et tibi reddetur votum in Jerusalem [music] Et tibi reddetur votum in Jerusalem [music] Exaudi orationem meam [music] Exaudi orationem meam [music] Ad te omnis caro veniet [music] Ad te omnis caro veniet [music] Ad te...
