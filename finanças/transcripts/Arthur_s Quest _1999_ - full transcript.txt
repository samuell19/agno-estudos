[ Clanging ] The land was at war. It was slowly being conquered by a band of dark knights led by an evil overlord. Should their battle prove successful, all of england would be enslaved, all hope would be lost. But from the encroaching darkness rode a new hope, the future king, the child Arthur. His destiny was to liberate the land from darkness. To do this, he would use the ultimate weapon of light, the sword Excalibur. Forged from the finest steel by the highlands blacksmiths, king pendragon and his faithful sorcerer, Merlin, used Excalibur to fight back the encroaching darkness. But the dark knights and the evil overlord were winning. Arthur is the hope... [ Swords clanging ] [ Men shouting ] [ Horse neighing ] Here. Uh! 3:00. Did you see me be brave, father? Yes, Arthur, I did. You will surely grow to be a most courageous king. Merlin? Morgana? You rang, sire? We have been defeated, Merlin. S bad news with you, isn't it? Why did you not predict this defeat? There was something blocking my vision. A horrible evil... Assembling the forces of darkness against you. All of my life I thought it was my destiny to unite this land in peace. But now all is lost. The land will be united. The dark knights will be vanquished. But it is not your destiny, my friend. It is the destiny of someone... Shall we say, quite close to you. Arthur. Oh, you poor thing. That's quite a nasty little cut you've got there. I failed? Your sorcery guaranteed that the dark knights would be taken by surprise. My visions were not accurate. Yours as well. Is there a sorcerer in this land who can guarantee their work?! Sire... What is it? As much as I detest kicking a king when he's down... The dark knights had everything, pendragon -- an unbeatable army, a thirst for blood and power -- everything except a leader... Until now. My apprentice, my companion... You used me? I did indeed, my love, but it was fun, was it not? A fleeting moment of power justifies the slaughter of your own people? Let's face it. The bad guys are just a lot more fun than you good guys. Nds now. It is Excalibur that she wants, sire. Morgana cannot fulfill her dark conquest of the world without the mystical power of your sword. You always have to go and blab everything, don't you? You know what you must do, Merlin. But sire -- do it! By the forces of light, by the portal that transcends time, space, matter -- get on with it, man! Everybody's a critic. Hocus-pocus! [ Rumbling ] He's opening the portal. I must have Excalibur. Always remember, my little king, the soul of a brave man never dies, for courage comes not from a crown but from within. I will be with you always. Merlin, take Excalibur. Heroes never die. Father! [ Horn honking, tires screeching ] Aaah! Aaah! Hey, watch where you're going, buttface! What -- what was that? A mechanical beast with the snarl of a dragon and fire for eyes. The angry peasant who called from its belly seems to have mistaken me for a lord buttface. I want my father, Merlin. I want to go home. Much of this will be hard for you to understand, my little king, but you must remain in this land, in this time, and I cannot be with you. Why? You see, the mystic portal we came through will close within minutes, and I must return to the past to stop my betrothed, that m-- to stop morgana from finding you. The portal will open once more, in 10 years, when the stars on Orion's belt shine with such brightness that flower petals will open in the middle of the night. Your mind is now empty of all that has gone before. When I return, I will restore those memories that would be too painful for you now. But in your heart, you will retain the skill of a knight, the soul of a poet, and the courage of a lion. You are and always will be king Arthur. Wait here. By the strength of steel, by the spirit of man, by the soul of a hero, and by the power of only Arthur himself! [ Grunting ] [ Vehicle approaching ] [ Tires screeching ] Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, did I hurt you? Did the car hit you? Where are your parents? What are you doing out here in the middle of the street? What's your name? Arthur. Arthur. I'm gonna help you find your parents, okay? Come with me. Up you go. Stay right there. An angel. [ Rumbling ] I will be back for you, young Arthur. I promise. Use the technoshield, Artie. Only the technoshield will destroy the dark knight. Are you sure? Yes, positive. [ Man laughs evilly ] The dark knight just destroyed my technoshield. Use the laser sword. Only the laser sword can destroy the dark knight. Forget the sword -- I'm going in. What?! Unarmed? You're not gonna make it. Oh! Way to go! I knew you could take it. How could I go wrong with your expert coaching? Hey, you almost snagged the high score. Yeah, like I want to be king. What, you have a problem wearing the crown? No, I have a problem wearing the tights. ♪ I don't want homework ♪ Okay, maybe with your expert coaching, I was like, "Mr. Dark knight, wah wah!" It was all me. Well, actually, you had some good coaching, too, but -- wait a second. How long were we in there? I don't know -- about 45 minutes, which makes it about... 3:00. You are a freak of nature. Do you know that? If we're not at the diner in 3 minutes, mom's gonna know we ditched school. Come on, let's go! ♪ Let's rock ♪ Your boy running late today? A little. Kids -- they drive you nuts, but the love they give you back makes it all worthwhile. I didn't know you had kids, Trent. I-I don't -- one day, though. I just need to find the right girl. [ Clanging ] Re doing?! Fried spam? Fried spam, 2 eggs and juice and drink -- nice. Hey, hilda. Hey, Artie. Hi, Gwen. All right, this is good. Perfect. Remember, play it cool. Here she comes. Hello. Hello. So, how was school today? Cool. Cosmic. Which one of you got the better grade on the history test? Artie did. I did. Good. Which one of you got the better score at the video arcade? Artie did, of course. How many times do we have to talk about this? It is my duty to put a roof over our heads, and it is your duty to go to school. Mom, I'm too young for duties and responsibilities. I hope you don't mean that. You know, I think Artie's only referring to, well, the maturation of his emerging fate in the cosmic metaphysical universe. See? Gwen feels the same way. Gwen gets straight a's. She can feel any way she wants. I have to go. But we're gonna talk about this later. [ Clears throat ] Thanks for your help. That was great. That's what friends are for, right? Right. Hmm. What? Come on. Let's get out of here. All right. Is it too much to ask for a portal that drops you off in a nice, soft haystack? Ohh. Oh, well, good day, sir. Perhaps you can help me. Help you? Yeah, well, I've just arrived in this area. Oh, well, yeah. I'm kind of the local welcome wagon around here. Oh, excellent. You see, I'm searching for a boy by the name of Arthur -- approximately 15 years of age. He's probably a civic leader of sorts, maybe even the hero of your township. I sense he is close by. I still need some assistance with landmarks in order to pinpoint his exact location. Landmarks? You got your "landmark" right here, pal. I take it this instrument is a weapon of some sort. It's the only weapon worth having. You see, this puts me at a distinct disadvantage. My magic is not yet quite up to speed. Yeah, that -- that'd be a problem. Fortunately, a brave king and very dear friend once taught me a battle maneuver should I find myself in a predicament such as this. And that would be? [ Sighs ] Ay, yi, yi. That foolish peasant. Oof! Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry! Are you okay? Are you all right? Do you know your name? W-Well, what is it? Mer-- merl-- merle. Merle, it's okay. It's okay. Don't worry. 'S you. It's the angel. [ Laughs ] Angel. You must be delirious. Come on. Let me get you up. I'll take you inside, clean you up a bit. [ Grunts ] Oh, dear. Girls, how are you? Good to see you. Well, listen, which one of you lucky girls is gonna go out with me this weekend? I can't believe that I just left that trash bag right in the middle of the alley. Oh, please, it -- I wasn't watching where I was going. You must have been in a hurry. Do you need to use the phone -- call your job, your wife? No, no. No job, no wife. You see, I've just arrived in your village. Oh, really? Well, welcome to north valley, . I don't know. I think I find the scenery quite beautiful so far. She wants sensitivity? Sensitivity I can do. Nice outfit. Thank you. Couldn't help hearing you're new to these parts. If you're looking for work, i'm looking for a new busboy. Busboy? Are you serious? What good is it owning a local business unless I can extend a helping hand to the people of our community? Well, I'll, uh, show you the ropes, give you some tips. I accept your gracious offer. Good, good. It was really sweet of you. Fred, you're fired. [ Knock on door ] Enter. I hope you're hungry tonight, señor, because it's enchiladas El supremo del Caitlin. What? Tuesdays are usually spam night. What's the occasion? I got an "a-" on my term paper in international law, so I'm feeling muy loco. Congratulations. Thank you. Hey, um... I, uh... I wanted to apologize for skipping class today. [ Sighs ] You know, I was young once, a long time ago. I know school's not all fun and games, but if you don't live up to your responsibilities, you're gonna end up just like me. That wouldn't be so bad. Oh, wear a nice shirt when you come down to dinner tonight. Why? What -- what kind of guest? A man guest -- someone I met at work. Wait -- that guy? Your boss? Mom, come on, it's gross. And his name, Trent -- it sounds like a soap opera. Please, mom, tell me you're not thinking about -- about what? About being 34 and wanting a little romance in my life? I think you better stay up here for dinner. That way you won't be disgusted by my behavior. Way to go, Artie. [ Doorbell rings ] [ Doorbell rings ] Hi, I brought -- wow! What do you call that sort of gown? Uh, a dress. Look, merle, about tonight, I -- thank you so much for getting me that job today. Merle -- and your dinner invitation was so gracious. I'm especially interested in meeting your young son, Arthur. [ Sighs ] Look, merle, I'm sorry. The flowers are beautiful, and you really are a very sweet man, but...I'm just not feeling up to it tonight. But I -- I'll see you at work tomorrow. I'm sorry. [ Sighs ] I save the young king, transcend time, . Sleep safely, my young king. I will see you in the morrow. Who's there? Oh, it's you. What are you doing? I followed you. See, now, this is my private place. You can't just follow someone to their private place. You know, you said the same thing when I followed you to your private sandbox in first grade, your private swing set in third grade, your private treehouse in the sixth grade. What's your point? You're an easy guy to follow. So why don't you follow yourself right back home again before your mom starts to wonder where you are? Well, that's unlikely. She's in Vegas with this week's boyfriend blowing our rent money on the craps tables. I'm sorry. It's okay. Cartwheel. Hey, at least she left me a couple candy bars for dinner, right? All right, so the big question is... Yeah. Y is it that all of a sudden, you decide to follow me tonight? It's your aura. [ Laughing ] My aura? So, you know what? Let's discuss my aura. I sense sadness, like something is missing. Actually, you know what? I did lose one of my skates yesterday. No, I'm serious. Your life is not what it was meant to be. I sense loss, imminent danger... [ Sighs ] Possibly...Death. Death? [ Laughs ] And we wonder why we have no friends. Hey, where do you think you're going? Come back here! Where do you think you're going? I'm escaping my death. I want to talk to you. I think I dropped aura. Did you see aura over there? The top step, when I hit it, the aura kind of just fell off. Deny it, but you're more into your cosmic metaphysical being than you think. The amphitheater. Ow! It's a brick wall. What are you doing? It's your sanctuary. My sanctuary? The only place where no one has to understand you or tell you how to fit in -- the only place where your feelings of isolation seem to make sense. I understand that isolation. What kind of girl do you think I am? [ Laughs ] Hey, speedy Gonzalez, wait up! Where are you going? That's funny. What's funny? These flowers usually close up at night. Must be the bright stars out tonight -- tricked them into thinking it was day. Where's my backpack? Shoot! I left it at the amphitheater. Come on, I'll race you back. Let's go. [ Rumbling ] Our quest is simple. Find the child, Arthur, spawn of pendragon. He will lead US to Excalibur. Ur back with US into the past, using its power to conquer the innocent and lead the earth into eternal darkness. [ Laughs evilly ] Come on! Come on! I just want the cash, pal. I don't need no pictures of your wife. [ Laughs ] Yeah, definitely just the cash. Get out of here. Come on, beat it! [ Chuckles ] Morgana: Pardon me, sir. I've got to start hanging out in a different alley. In spite of all the obvious advances humanity has made over several hundred years, it appears that the males have actually become more stupid. Hey! [ Laughs ] You missed, elvira. [ Cat screeching ] Pay attention, stupid one. I'm looking for a boy by the name of Arthur who would be about 15 years in age. I-I don't know. 15... He'd be a student at, uh, north -- north valley high. Thank you. Why are all you people looking for this kid? Someone else was here looking for the child Arthur? Yeah, yeah. This other guy. This other freak. A guy. This dude. This guy in a robe. But I didn't tell him nothing. I swear! Not to worry, boys. Merlin has no idea I learned the secret of the portal. We still possess the element of surprise. I sense a lot of evil in this century. Looks like I'm going to fit right in. Artie, for the last time, get up! If you're late for school this morning, mister, I swear I'm gonna stick your blades in the microwave. Did you hear me? Artie! All right, you alien pod, what have you done with my real son? [ Chuckles ] I am your real son. You look really nice, and you're dressed. I, uh, got to go. Got to go to school and learn all the stuff we talked about before, about responsibilities and algebra. And math and bye. I love you. Uh, thanks for breakfast. You look great today. I love you. Must have been the pep talk I gave him. Artie! Oh! Hi. You should have waited for me. I would have walked with you. I'm sorry. I just, you know, didn't even think about it. Why are you so sweaty? You look like you just ran a marathon. Sweaty? I was doing push-ups. Push-ups. Arthur! There you are! My, you have turned into a fine young man. Well...let's go. Do you know this guy? Mnh-mnh. Go where? Ah, of course. My young king, I had forgotten. You see, for me it's only been two days, but for you it's been 10 years. First, together we must find Excalibur and then cross the barriers of time, thus preserving the continuum of history as you take your throne and fulfill your destiny. Sure. Sign me up. Of course I wanted to do this in the presence of your mother, but alas, it was not to be. This is a fantastic tie. Would you -- you want one? Now, my young king, I assure you your memory will be completely restored always a good idea in portal travel. Let's not encourage him. And what is your name, milady? Gwen. Gwen. And are you betrothed to young Arthur? Well, that depends what kind of car he gets once he turns 16. Charming. We're late right now. We're gonna let you go. It's been a pleasure. It's nice to meet you. Thanks for having US. We'll stop by later. Arthur, i-I'm not joking. This is very serious. We'll send help. And I'd very much like to leave this place before morgana gets here. Arthur! Hello?! [ Bell ringing ] So you're the one who runs this school? No. I got a question for you. What's up with that Merlin guy exactly? This guy's a complete weirdo, right? I think he's cute. Cute? You would think that guy's cute. Did you see his tie and his coat? It was, like, lavender purple. What's up, guys? How you doing? All right. Where's Spock? Must have left him at home today. So I figure if I study for the biology test 15 minutes before, cram during lunch, and only drink skim milk, I'll be fine. I can't believe that principal bellwether was mugged right here on school campus. What is this world coming to? Here comes your file now. It appears to be that you are the new substitute principal, miss... Blackheart. Principal morgana blackheart. Since I am such a fan of deafening silence, who would like to give me a definition. Jake? I didn't do it, man. If you're speaking of your homework, that I agree. I can't vouch for anything else. W-What's the question then? Definition. It's what a word means. That's very good, Jake. That's a definition of the word "definition." [ Laughter ] I'm looking for a definition of legend. Mr. Regal... Mr. Whitney, how you doing? A definition of legend? I have absolutely no idea. Oh, I think you do, Arthur. What difference does it make? Honestly. I mean, how important is it that I impress this class by knowing the answer? The past which may lack accurate historical evidence but has been and may still be popularly accepted as true. Excellent. Excellent. Arthur, how come your friend's enthusiasm for learning hasn't rubbed off on you? I don't know. Maybe I just don't follow her around enough. Legends are often referred to as a place where history and fictional literature collide. Would someone like to give me a popular legend? How about Merlin and king Arthur? Well, I learned about it from Artie. Very good, Gwen. He's a big fan. Oh, really, Arthur? I didn't know you were a buff on legendary leaders. [ Laughs ] I'm actually -- I'm actually not. I'm more of a lone wolf. Oh, don't sell yourself short, Arthur. Here's a list of all the names of the bs that begin with Arthur and their schedules. Do you know which one you're looking for? I'll know him when I see him. I'll be at my desk if you need me. Merlin? Here at the school? I can't risk exposing US before we can get to Excalibur. [ Chuckling ] Toss a little of this on the old goat. It'll screw up his powers for a while -- long enough for US to complete our plan. Now, my dissertation at the university of Detroit was entitled "legendary leaders -- it's lonely at the top." Now, not for all leaders, mind you. But many times, friends played an important part in legends. In respect to the arthurian legend, Merlin was an important confidant... What are you doing? Trying to save your life, my young king. It seems to me you don't quite appreciate the seriousness of this situation. Look, you are going to make me even less popular than I am right now, and that is really saying something at this point. Will you then believe that I am Merlin and you are young king Arthur? You seem like a nice guy. You got this thing going for you with the suit and the tie. It's just that I can't -- you know what? Fine. You levitate me, I'm king Arthur. Let's do it. Excellent. Excellent. All right. By the force of the elements, by the power of the winds -- we got to do this today sometime 'cause I've got class. Very impatient century. Sorry. Hocus... Pocus! Are you satisfied? Now, please, for the last time, just... Go home. That was one long trip to the bathroom, Mr. Regal. They, uh, ran out of toilet paper, so I was... That's more information than I need to know. Now, I would like you to turn to page 209, where we will begin with the chapter on king Arthur. Excuse me. I'm in the middle of a lecture here, and the door was closed for a reason. By bolting in here, you've caused a disruption. Well put, you silver-tongued devil. I am principal blackheart, and I am looking for a certain young man who must report directly to my office. You. Your name is Arthur? Artie. Yeah. Come with me, Artie yeah. I-I-If there's anything that -- that -- that I-I -- I can -- oh, boy. [ Wind blowing ] I checked your records. We are very much alike, young Arthur. I mean, Artie. How do you figure? I, too, was abandoned as an infant, raised by an adoptive mother. Why he abandoned me -- somehow that would explain why I don't fit in. Do you know why your parents gave you up? Yes! They feared my powers. Your -- your powers? Oh, powers of positive thinking. Do you think that my father feared me? Cowards fear what they do not understand. Then that fear turns to hate. The only way to fight that, to hold your head up high, is to hate them back twice as hard. How do I do that? I can help you, young Artie. First you must clear your mind. Think back to the past -- the symbol which links you to your heritage. Excalibur! [ Swords clanging, men shouting ] Did you see me be brave, father? Heroes never die. [ Echoing ] Father! Father! Enough wallowing in the past. How would you like to do me one small favor? Artie, come on. Let's get going. Are we finished here, principal blackheart? For now. Conniving little schemer, that girl -- the only part of her I do like. I have seen Excalibur. That rat Merlin has put a spell upon the sword. Only Arthur himself can free it from the stone. The portal is still open for two days. Keep Arthur alive for now. As for Merlin and goody-goody Gwen, I have other plans. Ahh! You know, you've done quite a fine job with young Arthur. Why, the last time I saw him -- you must be very proud. It can't be easy raising a child all on your own. Oh, yeah. It's quite a juggling act -- this job and night school. You go to school? Yeah. I have this stupid idea that one day i'm gonna have a career where I don't need to wear a nametag. That's not stupid. It's noble, like so much else about you. I can see that nobility in your eyes. Kindness...compassion... Willing to give up so much thank you. They're screaming for their food. Ain't you got floors to mop, Earl? Merle. Whatever. Uh, Caitlin? Yes? I have a little gift for your son. Oh. Roller hockey! Oh! Oh, my gosh! They're front-row seats. He's gonna love them. Oh, Trent, you really didn't have to. I know I didn't. I wanted to. Well, thank you. He'll really like them. Nice gesture. I thought so. They must be very valuable. Are you kidding? Front-row seats? Am. I figured I could score a few points with Caitlin if I put a grin on the face of her bratty kid. And here I thought chivalry was dead in this century. Yeah. [ Chuckles ] A little advice -- you want to keep your job and your teeth, remember, that's just between US guys, right, berle? Merle. Whatever. A double-double vinny's breakfast burrito with triple cheese, extra bacon, and large fries. One of these breakfasts will kill you and the other one will make you sick, and I don't know which one is which. Thanks. Don't take too long. I don't want you to be late for school. Thank you. Bye! I walked into that math test today, it could have been in Japanese. I have no idea what any of it said. I was, like, "hmm, 7. Hmm, 5." You need to start studying. I need a gremlin in my backpack giving me answers. [ High-pitched voice ] "A. B." [ Normal voice ] I'd get straight a's. Merlin: Can I get those dishes for you? Oh, my god. Morgana could show up here any moment, and she and her dark knights will destroy you just as they destroyed your father. Once she takes Excalibur back through the portal into the past, history will change instantaneously. This world as you know it will be lost forever. Kind of like my appetite. Do you mind taking this while you're here? Hi, Gwen. Will you stop encouraging this man? I think I got all the bugs worked out of my magic. If I levitate this table, will it finally convince you that I am Merlin and you are the one and only king Arthur? Let it fly, Houdini. All right. The incantation will be, as you kids say, short and sweet. I'm gonna focus. Hocus... Pocus! [ Low voice ] Oh, no. [ Normal voice ] I think I feel something. Thanks. I wonder if he'd fit in my backpack. [ Giggles ] That'd be a choice gremlin right there. Let's go. At this point, it's just like, oh, Artie. He's harmless. Harmless today 'cause he thinks he's Merlin. What if tomorrow he wakes up and thinks he's Jack the ripper? You're just mad 'cause you think he's got a crush on your mom. Whose side are you on anyway? Ugh! Ohh! Arthur! Ugh! The other one's taken Gwen! Are you all right? Go! Ugh! Ugh! [ Horn honking, tires screeching ] Ugh! Ohh! Are you all right? I'm going. [ Panting ] Somebody stop him! Stop! Stop! [ Dog barking ] Ugh! You all right? [ Coughing ] What is going on?! Morgana! It is beginning. Thank you very much, officer. I'll keep trying to get ahold of her mother. I don't know how concerned she's gonna be, but, look, if you come up with anything, please contact me. Woman: 735 code 6, 105 north Anderson... This era, this time -- it is hard on the children. At least our century has toilet paper. Good point. For crying out loud! This is crazy! Where are you from, merle? And who is this morgana person? Is my son in danger? Okay... You're gonna think this is insane, but I'll just go ahead and say it anyway. I...am Merlin! And king Arthur. King Arthur? The king Arthur? Yes. [ Laughs ] Where in north valley do you expect to find king Arthur? We don't even have a Wal-Mart here. You, Artie? You're king Arthur? He seems to think I am. What? After all this, you still don't believe? I believe there's some freaky stuff going on. I believe that those guys that kidnapped Gwen, somehow I recognize them from the past. I don't know. It's a start. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I don't know who you are, Merlin, or how you're connected to all this, but I want you out of this house and away from my kid! Mom. Morgana needs your son to get Excalibur. And if she doesn't get it, she will kill him. He's your date from that night from work? That was a date? Get out! Caitlin, I know how you feel. You want to protect Arthur, but if we don't do anything when that portal closes at midnight tonight, we all die. You do not know how I feel. You don't even know me! I was there, Caitlin... 10 years ago. I saw you stop and pick up Arthur when he was wandering on the street... Ask him his name... Care for him. You promised to keep him safe. Now it's time for you to keep that promise. You're safe. I lost them there around the school. Let's just go there. Come on. [ Rock music playing, people shouting ] Help! Artie! Mrs. Frays! Someone get me out of here! Ugh! Artie! [ Sighs ] I'm never gonna get out of here. [ Shouting and cheering ] Where is everybody? Principal blackheart rearranged the class schedules 5 minutes. 5 minutes longer? Nope. 5 minutes shorter? Nope. You mean the entire class period is only 5 minutes long? Yeah! How cool is that? You got to love principal blackheart. She's beautiful, she's smart, and she's one heck of an efficient manager. And you're okay with this? It doesn't seem very, you know, what's the word -- responsible. Ah, who cares? You're a teacher. I mean, you're supposed to care. No, no. You were right all along, Artie. Duties and responsibilities are for suckers. Like you said -- "I'm just not the leader type." Oh, hey. How you guys doing? Welcome back. Isn't that the, uh, the gang -- the switchblade gang? I thought these guys were expelled. Expelled? No, no. Principal blackheart reinstated them this morning. What? You're looking at the new student government. That?! [ Rock music blares ] "Little is known of Arthur's childhood. Between the ages of 5 and...15." "One legend tells the tale "of Merlin hiding the boy Arthur "from king pendragon's most trusted, "but ultimately traitorous, ally -- "a warrior and sorceress by the name of morgana le Faye. See picture on page 407." Oh, Mrs. Frays, thank goodness you're here! Are you e-mailing the superintendent to tell him what's going on here? Are you crazy? I'm working on my résumé. I'm getting far away as I can from principal Satan. Oh, no. She had a very busy schedule today. Well, can I see it? "8:00 A.M. -- teach shop classes how to make swords and Spears"? "11:45 A.M. -- "switch gym classes from volleyball to gladiator battles to the death"? Just keep writing your résumé. Okay, there's got to be something somewhere. Mrs. Frays, forget the e-mail. Call the cop -- [ typewriter keys clacking ] Uh... Can't we all just get along? [ Cheering ] Merlin: It's not safe for you here. Merlin! Merlin! Morgana -- she's here. You know, I can sense it. I think my powers are coming back. But I already figured that one out. Oh, you got a battle plan? I got one that works for me, yeah. Okay, okay, grab a weapon. Oh, come on. This is a high-school cafeteria, not a medieval armory. Aah! Aah! Go! Come on, Merlin! The wand, the pointy hat, the magic powers! Push! Whoa! Whoa! I don't have a magic wand. Come on! Use your powers! By the courage of a king... By the wisdom of a mother... By the strength... Of love. Hocus-pocus! Whoo! Who uses a magic wand? Artie! Please, someone get me out of here! [ Grunting ] It's jammed! Help me! Move. Gwen! Oh, I'm so glad you're okay! Morgana -- she's going after Artie! You all right? [ Rock music playing ] Hello, morgana. It's taken a little while, but I'm beginning to remember everything. And you can get your own stinking sword out of the stone. [ Laughs ] You are an even greater fool than your father, you insignificant little worm, if you think you have even the slightest chance of defeating morgana, ruler of the dark knights, the most powerful sorcerer, and the mightiest warrior the world has ever known. [ Music stops ] If you do not liberate Excalibur from the stone, you are quite worthless to me. You have no idea who you are dealing with. Hail to the king. Begone, sorceress! You are no match for the master...At...Full... Power! Are you all right? Yeah. This is not yet over. The spell I cast upon morgana was temporary. Take Gwen to the amphitheater. I will try to put your mother at ease. She needs to believe all is well. Please forgive me, my young king, for what I am about to do. But I must deceive sweet Caitlin. Why am I going to work? I feel like I should be with Artie. Oh, he'll be fine, and you can't risk getting fired. You know what? I'm going to take him right back home. We won't even stop for ice cream. I guess, uh, you'll be leaving soon. To...go back to Camelot or wherever. Actually, Camelot hasn't happened yet. That -- that comes later on. It's all... Very complicated. [ Clears throat ] Caitlin... Merlin... You saved my boy's life. You are a hero. You raised that boy. You're the hero. You promise? Hey! Speak of the devil. So, what happens now? Well, first of all, the good news -- morgana and the dark knights have retreated for the time being. And luckily, they didn't get Excalibur. And the bad news is that morgana still has to be defeated, because otherwise she'd continue her reign of terror. And Artie? I mean king Arthur. Oh, you're cute. You're cute. Is to withdraw Excalibur from the stone and then travel back with me through the portal and take his rightful place in history as young king Arthur. The round-table stuff will come later. He's got to choose his brave knights first, then there'll be questing -- I'm -- I'm not gonna go. But you have to go. Altering the natural flow of history would be... Catastrophic. But that's not my fault. But millions of good people are counting on you. Then millions of good people are going to have to count on somebody else. But the portal is gonna close in a couple hours! I don't care. I'm not going. It is your destiny to be king, Arthur. Look at me. Who am I? I'm Artie, all right? I'm a 20th-century, smartass kid that's it. I'm not going. Are you kidding me? After all this whining about not fitting in. I've got news for you. After 15 years, you've found the shoe. It fits. Wear it. I didn't ask to rule a kingdom. Oh, boy. I made a promise to your father, Arthur. Ruling that kingdom is your responsibility. Again with the responsibilities junk. My only responsibility is to me and my mother. Okay, look, Arthur... Caitlin is an incredible... Beautiful, wonderful woman. And as much as I... Respect her, the truth is, she's not your real mother. Oh, don't you ever say that! Don't you ever say that! She took in a lost 5-year-old kid that nobody else wanted! Working for some jerk in a lousy job for me! So that someday I can have a life, so she can be proud of me. If you're looking for a real knight in shining armor, you're looking for my mother. That's my boy. Not today, Trent. I've had a really bad day, and I told you before, I don't think it's a good idea that we go out. Come on, Caitlin. One lousy date. That's what it'd be -- one lousy date. Oh, I get it. You want better shifts, right? A few free meals for your kid? Look, I'm seeing somebody. Seeing somebody? Are you in love with that somebody? Yeah, I think I am. Hmm. Table for three. Mom! I've got to talk to you... About... Mom... My name is morgana, and I'll be regal ruler for today. Can I tell you about our specials? You -- such a spirit, Artie boy. Bravo! I want my mother back, you psycho. And I want Excalibur. Hmm... This situation has the makings of a deal. Highest point in the town. Be there at midnight with Excalibur, or else the 21st century will be short one bad waitress. Morgana... She murdered my father, she kidnapped my mother... She tortures my family and friends. It's...no more. It ends here. It ends now. There is only one with the power to withdraw Excalibur from that stone. I believe in you, Arthur. You need to believe in yourself. [ Rumbling ] Merlin, get up. My friends don't kneel before me. Besides, this is gonna be a battle like morgana and those dark knights have never seen before. They're on my turf now. Well? Yes, well? Well what? The plan? What's the plan? You tell US, sire. You're Mr. Wizard. I thought you had the plan. But you are the king. Is there some rule in your time that says the king has to have the plan? As a matter of fact, that is the rule in our time. That'll be the first thing I change when I get back. Gentlemen, please. I'll make the plan. Who died and made you king? Centuries of rule by men. No wonder the dark ages lasted so long. Okay, look, I have very little magic left. My powers alone may not be enough to save you when you battle morgana this time. That's bad. On the other hand, she has spent the past several days squandering her sorcery. That's good. Unfortunately, she still is the deadliest and strongest warrior and swordsman in all the land. That's bad. But I have Excalibur and the forces of good on my side, which means I have a pretty good chance, right? Merlin? This is when you're supposed to chirp in and be like, "that's good." Merlin and I have 100% confidence in you. She speaks the truth. Are you sure? As sure as I am the world is flat. I have a plan. Come on, let's get out of here. Okay, Gwen's got a plan. Oh, boy. Arthur... Come on, let's go! Morgana: Welcome, Artie boy. I held up my end of the bargain. Come on. I'm here. Where is she? And look -- you brought a gift to our little party. How thoughtful. Where is she? Where's my mother? Mommy? Why, she has the best seat in the house. They harm so much as a hair on Caitlin's head, I swear I will -- op them. Oh! Oh! Shh! Let her go! You might want to rethink that, Artie boy. I do away with mommy, and it's a nonstop world for you of cutting class, video games till midnight, and renting really violent r-rated movies. [ Muffled ] Artie! Mom! Unh, unh, unh -- you don't get her yet. There's a little matter of my ticket to dark-ages domination in your hands. I'm surprised. You've adapted so well. Why would you want to go back to the past? There lies the problem, you see. There are so many evil people in your century, it makes it hard to really stand out as a good villain. Why don't you come out of the darkness? Run me through with your sword like you did to my father. Come on. You know you want to. For a kid, you really know your way to a woman's heart. Itney, what are you doing here? I followed morgana. After she started losing her powers, it broke the spell she had on me. So you know that Artie is... King Arthur, yes. Who's he? This is our history teacher, Mr. Whitney. Mr. Whitney, this is -- oh, Gwen, there's no need for introductions. I'm honored. It is a dream come true to meet you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Lancelot! That's, uh, that's sir Lancelot. Look, I'll go distract the dark knights. You free Caitlin. I can help. Okay. Well, maybe you like the darkness, is that it? That's where you used to hide as a child, torturing animals with your magic, being called a freak by your own parents. Enough talk! Merlin's not here. Do not insult me, Artie boy. I sense his feeble powers. But if that's the way you want to play it... Stop! Leave her alone. If any harm comes to that woman, morgana, I swear I'll strike you down faster than a bolt of lightning. You've got to be kidding. You're in love with her. No, he's not. Are you? Later. You've had the opportunity to spend eternity as my mate, my equal. You were never interested in equality. All you wanted was dominance. Possibly. So you would rather keep the company of that trashy commoner? Are you kidding me? She's 100 times the woman you are. Run the wench through! No! Let's go. I get Excalibur, and your beloved little family is allowed to live. Merlin? Yes, my king? What was my father like? Your father was -- he is just like you. And as long as that sword fights on the side of good, he will always be with you. So, what's it gonna be? The sword? Or will he take the headless mommy behind door number two? Listen, you witch. The name of the sword is Excalibur, and I am Arthur -- king Arthur. [ Swords clashing ] What took you so long? Face it, Artie boy -- you're too soft. Aah! Whoa! [ Groans ] You cannot win, child! I might surprise you. Read your history. Force triumphs, brutality wins wars, courage comes from vengeance. See, you just don't get it, do you? Hate, anger, and rage -- those are all traits of weakness. But love, honor -- those are signs of strength. Y? Have a taste of a little hate. Aah! Ugh! [ Laughs ] Morgana has won! Won! I remember my father... Standing before you. Unarmed. A man of courage. A man of honor. A man of strength. But he is not gone, morgana. Because brave men never truly die. For the last time, I am king Arthur, and you are finished. [ Both straining ] Evil and good do not mix. Aah! Mom! Artie! Oh, I'm so glad you're okay. What happened to that wicked witch morgana? Let's just say we... Dropped the house on her. And the dark knights? Well, they kind of got microwaved. It's always good news with you, isn't it? [ Rumbling ] You know what I'm gonna say. Either we all go together, or nobody goes at all. What do you say, Caitlin? It's a land of heroes, and no one wears a nametag. Just so you know -- I want an interesting job like secretary of state or something. A wise woman once said to me, "you can be whatever you want to be." You don't get a jousting license till you're 18, and I can still ground you anytime I want. You make it a learner's permit at 16, you've got yourself a deal. You're gonna need a tutor. This doesn't get you out of an education. Oh, I... I-I better stay and undo all the damage morgana did at school. It's a mess. Gwen: You sure? I'm not a dark-ages guy. I mean...The armor would give me a rash. Thanks for everything, Mr. W. Um...gwen... I know we're young and we... But i'm... I'm gonna need a queen. How about a co-king? Gwen... Vice king? Remember, Arthur... You're not king yet. Father? My son. [ Rumbling ] "Chapter seven -- "legend of king...Artie.
