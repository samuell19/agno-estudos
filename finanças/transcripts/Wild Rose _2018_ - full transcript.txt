Rose-Lynn Harlan, ladies and gentlemen, performing for the first time here in Nashville, Tennessee. - [Rose-Lynn] Whoo! - Fuckin'-A. Right, I'll see you. - When? - [siren wailing in distance] When? [birds chirping] [gate squeaks] [doorbell chimes] [boy] Mum! [Rose-Lynn] Oh, hi. [door creaks] Come on, Lyle. Come on. Where do you think you're going, all done up like a fish supper? [chuckling] Christ, he's got you down, so he has. That's scary. Don't do that. Anyway, I'm not going anywhere. I'm having my dinner wi' yous. [Lyle chatters to himself] [chatters to himself] He never shuts up, you never speak. What's going on in there, eh? Sponsored silence? Did you miss me, eh? Hmm? [door opens] [footsteps] [door closes] - [sighs] - [woman] Rose-Lynn? - I thought you were your mum there. - [Rose-Lynn laughs] That cannae have been 12 month. The time's went in like that. - Aye. - [door opens] Hello, Marion! Night, both of you. [door closes] She looks good. Amanda. Aye. So she should. Enough time at it. - Does she still lie out here on tin foil? - Oh, aye. One peek of the sun and that one's in a bikini. - Other day she was in after my butter. - Your butter? Puts it all over her. "It's natural, Marion." Aye, natural if you're a roll. [Rose-Lynn chuckles] Mary was gonna come tonight to see you, but she's awful bad with her arthritis, so... - Oh, that's a shame. - Aye. It's in her knees now so that's her had to retire. It's, uh... Eight pound an hour, holidays. Says she'll see you into it as a favour to me. Cleaning, aye? Aye, very good. Why, what were you thinking? Thinking? No. I wasnae thinking. I've just got out. Don't you worry about me. No, I wasnae. I was thinking about your kids. I'm going to Nashville. Well, you better mind your tag doesnae go off when you're going through security. First thing I'm going down the Opry I'm gonna get my job back and I'm gonna work for it. There's nothing for me here. There I can be honing my craft, out gigging every night. Honing your cra...? Do you not think you've sacrificed enough for that fantasy? - Have we all not sacrificed enough? - How's it a fantasy? - It's the only thing I'm good at. - Learn a trade. - Go to college. - You're not listening. I don't care what you do, but do something. I've got my talent and I'm gonna use that. Have you not been watching telly? There's no shortage of folk who can sing.

[Jackie] Was there mice before? - [Rose-Lynn] Aye. - Well, then, there's nothing new under the sun. I hear you're on the tag. Cannae fart round here. Aye, I am, but I've appealed it, so a couple of weeks I'll be brand-new. Fridays and Saturdays, boom. Fridays and Saturdays we've got Mississippi Tundra. [Rose-Lynn] Who? [Rose-Lynn laughs] Christ, yous must be desperate! Nobody wants to see a convicted criminal up there. Folk come here to get away from all that. Johnny Cash was a convicted criminal, you bawbag. Anyway, away back to your mousetraps. I need this job, Jackie, and it's my fucking band. It's the house band. You're your own worst enemy, you. I wouldnae agree. There's strong competition. - Fuck you! Fuck off! - Fucking stupid cow! - You nicked my job, did you? - Get off! Get off me!

But she's no plans to go back. - Oh, it's beautiful up there. - Majestic. Yeah. Right, I'm off to spend a penny. So, it's £12 an hour. Twelve? Actually, Mary gets... Eight pound? Right, but... she can afford to go that low because she's on the brew as well. Brew? She drinks? - I don't think Mary drinks. - No, no. The brew is like, you know, the dole. - Really? - Mm, yeah, yeah. Whereas I'll not be up to anything like that. It's just not me. Know what I mean? Don't embarrass her by mentioning it. Oh, you were needing more bleach, Susannah. I'll give you the receipt for it. Oh, okay. Thanks. [whirring] Rose-Lynn? - Oh, Jesus! - Rose-Lynn? Sorry.

No, no, you're staying here with your mammy. But you'll see me every day. You'll see me every day, dafty. [Lyle] I'm coming home with you. [Marion] No, you stay with your mammy. Now, be a good boy.

Shh, shh. - [Lyle screams] - [Rose-Lynn] Come on, Lyle. [Lyle] I don't wanna stay here! [Lyle continues screaming] [train rumbling past in distance] [chattering outside] See, on Friday, will we go out for our dinner? I remember what your favourite is. It's pizza. I like sausage, cheese, tomato. She likes cheese, tomato and cheese. [Rose-Lynn] Are you coming with us? Hmm? [sizzling] - [Rose-Lynn] Right, that's me away. - Okay. The kids tell me you're a country and western singer. Are you taking the piss? No! No, not at all. Why do you say that? Country and western? No, it's just country. Oh, I didn't realise. You must be very good because all I've heard all week is "Rose-Lynn." - Why country? - 'Cause it's three chords and the truth. [chopping] Wow. And it goes like that, just gets whatever's in there out. Anyways, I'll see you next week. Thanks very much. Bye. Bye. [chattering, laughing] All right. Thanks. Oh, sorry. After you. Him, that fucking prick. [grunts] Shit. Sorry, mate. Fuck. - [woman] Get out! - Fuck. - Oh, sorry, pal. Sorry. - Watch yourself. - Ah, don't worry about it. It's fine. - [groans] I'm all right, Davey. - That's me. You fucking idiot! - No, no, no. I just fell on the floor. - Where you going? - I've got my curfew. Never mind the curfew. Come on, stay. - Drink mine. - Stay. Oi! Fuck! [phone ringing] Hello. Galloways the butcher's. What can I get you? Yeah, I'm playing with you. I'm only kidding you on. Aye, yeah, Rose-Lynn Harlan. I'm here. All right, okay, bye. - Oh... - What happened to pizza? You cannae promise them something and then just disappear. - You cannae do that. - I didnae disappear. I was at my work, waiting on my wages. Please! You're not fooling anybody, Rose-Lynn. And you cannae fool me. See, you tell them something, you don't go back on it. That's basic. That's basic.

Is there a scene? Oh, no, no. No, there's fuck-all here. It's actually what I'm... - I'm actually trying to get to Nashville. - Oh. I'm needing to raise a couple of grand so I can get flights and a hotel. I cannae drive, so I'm needing a driver as well. It wouldnae be more than two or three, definitely less than five. Oh... Rose-Lynn, I... I'm sorry, I can't just give you money, if that's what you're suggesting. - I'm sure it wasn't. - No, it was. - I can't do that. - How no'?

I've been the star fucking attraction at Glasgow's Grand Ole Opry since I was 14. - And? - And what? Nothing. Why haven't you gone in for one of those TV talent shows? They're no' for folk who can sing. They're for folk who want to sit in with their saag aloo and watch the telly. Isn't it a way of meeting someone here who can introduce you to someone there? There's nobody here. That's why I'm away. No one in the whole of Britain knows anything about country music? - Except me. - Except you? Yeah. And Bob Harris. Who's that?

Priesthill. - Ah, Pollok way. - Aye, yeah. - Sam's from Clydebank. - Clydebank? How did you get here from Clydebank, break in through a window? Learned a trade from my father and then I started up on my own. [Rose-Lynn] Aye? What trade? Conservatories? Is that they big glass things stuck on the side of houses? I'm no' being funny, but who needs a conservatory in Glasgow? - You'd be surprised. - Oh, aye, I would be. - [Sam] What are you looking for? - [Rory] iPad. - [Sam] Did Mum say you can have it?

[Susannah] I've got something. "Dear Susannah, so wonderful to hear from you after all this time. I passed your email on to Liz. Remember Liz used to piss in the sink?" She, um... Oh, she works on the Today programme and she sent the link to her husband who covers sport for Radio 2 and he forwarded the link to Bob Harris's producer. Oh, my God! - Oh, my fucking God! - Wait. "Bob would be very happy to meet her if she fancied coming down to London to watch a live recording." Do you know how many times I've written to that wee bastard and how many BBC pens I got back in return? How did you do that? How did you even fucking do that? - Sent a few emails. - I cannae be...

[gasps, sings] ♪ BBC Radio 2 ♪ Aye, I know, I know. It's mad. That would be some doors he could open for you. Is... Is it all right if you babysit? Oh, of course she will. - How did this come about? - Susannah. Oh. Very nice of her to help you. Can she unlock tags as well? You served 12 months for attempting to smuggle a package of heroin into Cornton Vale by throwing it over the perimeter fence. I didnae know it was heroin. But you were reckless as to what the package contained. If you mean, was I off my face and didnae ask what was in it, then aye. I had wains and everything and they give me the jail. Pure ridiculous. That's what my advocate said at the time... it's no' my fault. Well, whose fault was it? Well, it was the judge's, obviously, for giving me the sentence. Your Lordship, a more contrite young lady it would be hard to find. Ms Harlan has done a lot of soul-searching. She has... dug deep. And she's put her childish ways behind her. She now works full-time as a daily woman and her children are living with her once again. Though Ms Harlan is no longer in prison, neither is she free. Wearing a tag means she is unable to seek employment in her own line of work. - You just told me she's a daily woman. - Yes. But if you turn the page, sir... you'll see my client is also a promising young country and western singer. [Rose-Lynn scoffs] Oh, for God's sake. It's just "country." [louder] It's just "country." My lord, this young lady must be allowed out in the evenings if she is to make a new start. - [music playing] - [chattering] - [cheering] - Yeah! - You are barred. - You can take that up with my lawyer who'll be having a whisky and Coke.

[both chuckle] Oh, is that where they go, Miranda Lambert and all that? - All they folk who come in here? - It is, yeah. And we've got someone fabulous playing later. Would you like to have a look around? So, this is very exciting, meeting a home-grown country star. From Glasgow! I mean, it's a great music city, Glasgow. Oh, yeah? I'm trying to get to Nashville, obviously, but... I mean, who's ever heard of a country singer from Glasgow? That's ridiculous. It cannae be. Why not? Well... See my life? My life's like being one of these transsexuals. You know? When you're born a man, but you were meant to come out a lassie. Yeah, that is me. I should have been born in America. I'm an American, but here I am. - Do you write? - Oh, no. - Can you play? - [burps] No. Honestly, I don't think it matters whether you're from Glasgow, Scotland or Glasgow, Kentucky if you've got a voice and you've got something to say.

Yeah, out of my bag, with my bag. - Crap. - Didnae matter. - It was fucking-A! - Was it? Really? I'm gonna get there. I am gonna fucking get there. Yes, you bloody are. - Listen. - Yeah? I'm gonna be 50 in a minute and... I was gonna have this drinks party for which I've got very little enthusiasm for. 'Cause over the weekend I realised what I really need is a "party" party, a great big fuck-off house party, featuring, say, a set by... a young up-and-coming country singer, Rose-Lynn Harlan. What? You want me to play at your party? Yeah. Will you? - Well, aye, yeah, course I will. - That is brilliant. That is not the exciting bit. The exciting bit is, instead of bringing gifts, people will contribute to a cause that is very close to my heart... you. You perform a set. If people like what they hear, which they will, then they invest in you, in your career. That's, like, a hundred people spending between £50 and £100. Voilà. By the magic of crowd-funding, you are there. - Where? - The Isle of Man. Nashville! What, you're gonna tax your pals to come to your house for an audience with your daily woman? Yeah. - You've lost the plot, hen! - [Susannah laughs] - Oh, do you have a band? - Aye, yeah, course I do. - When is it? - Next Sunday. You've already booked the week off, and you can use that time to rehearse. Oh, no. No, I cannae do that week. But it's cool, I don't need to rehearse. I've been playing with these guys since I was 14. Rose-Lynn, you definitely need to rehearse. If you're asking people for money, if... If you want people to buy in to the idea that you're gonna make it out there, then you need to put in a really professional performance. Oh, yeah, cool, yeah. Fucking-A. Brilliant. Whoo! [Susannah walks away] Well... I cannae fault it. [both chuckle] Mum? - Susannah's needing me in next week. - She cannae have you. Kids are on holiday. She can do without you for a week. You said you'd take them away. Well, it's no', uh... it's no' cleaning I'd be doing, it's rehearsing. I'm doing this gig at her house. She's invited all these people and I'm gonna perform with my band. And then they're gonna invest. Invest? Invest in what? In me, in my career, in getting to Nashville. Oh. I don't remember her investing in Mary when she was in agony with her hip. Eighteen-month waiting list. If she'd money to spare, she could have forked out on that. She isnae forking it out. She's giving me a chance to earn it. But it's got to be good, no pub band. We havenae long to put it together. I phoned the school to see about holiday club, but it's all full up, and I'd rather they were with you 'cause I don't want them thinking... Thinking what? That you cast them off when you get a better offer? Or that all this is for nothing 'cause you've still got one foot out the door? I cannae help you. I havenae booked the time off. You've been there 20 year. - Special circumstances. - I've used that enough. Aye, when I was fucking up. What's for you will no' go by you. This is me trying to make something of myself. Surely to God that's a good thing for them. A good thing for them? No' letting them down again and again and again, that would be a good thing for them. And I thought you'd turned a corner. More fool me! - [Wynonna] Where are we going? - [Lyle] To the beach. We're going to go into the sea and look at different jellyfish. Come on. That's a good boy. Come on. Here we go. Oh, in yous come. [Lyle] I don't want to go in there! Mary's gonna look after you for a wee while this week, okay? I didn't say a week, Rose-Lynn, I said today. - [Lyle cries] - [Mary] Oh, you're fine, you're fine. Come on. Mum'll be back. You'll be fine. - [door slams] - [Lyle cries out] [Rose-Lynn] ♪ Well, I never did crawl And I never did toe the line ♪ Ah, no. Come on, this is...

So, if you could all be here from 4.00 tomorrow, then we'll run sound check from 4.30, and after that... we'll go to the lighting cues. Big day tomorrow, gents. This girl has cleaned her last floor. [man laughs] [Susannah] Leave it. You don't have to do that. No, it's all right. I'll just... I'll just pop them inside. I nicked it from the tech guys. Fancy a smoke? Oh, no, I've... I've got to go. - Really? - Yeah. Can you roll it? When I first met Sam, we lived in this shittiest little flat on Clydeside. There was nothing there, not like it is now. We had rats because of the river, we were broken into nearly once a week, but we had these really, really amazing parties. [chuckles] Don't really want this. - Do you have someone? - No, I'm... free as a bird. Lucky you. You're young. You're incredibly talented. You're at the height of your powers. There is nothing you can't do. This is your time. Once you've got kids, it's a little bit different. [chuckles] Yeah. [door closes] I'd better go. [Sam] Hello? - How are you, honey? - I'm fine, thank you. - I'll drop you home. - Oh, no, you're all right. - It's fine. I'll just take the bus. - No, come on. - Sleep well. - Aye, yeah. See you in the morning. You homesick, aye? [Rose-Lynn laughs] What, is this the one where you try and stick it up the daily woman? No, no. This is the one where I tell you that I'm on to you. I know you did the jail. And I know what you were in for. Susannah's bought into whatever it is you're selling, and I'm not about to take that away from her now. But I don't want you anywhere near my kids, so... See the morrow? Sing your song, get your money, then you're gone. [exhales heavily] Lyle, hurry up. We haven't got all day. Rosie! Where you been, man? Havenae seen hide nor hair of you. [key turns in lock] - All right, wee man? - I'll be in in a minute. [children arguing] You all right, pal? Aye, you know, I'm brand-new. [thudding from inside] [screaming] Lyle? His name's Lyle. He's five. He swung on a wardrobe and it fell on him. I think it's just his arms that he's hurt, but maybe his head as well. Okay, Lyle, do you mind if I have a wee look? - Ow! - Shh, shh, shh... - All right. - She's gonna have a wee look, okay? - Any allergies? - No, I don't... I don't think so, no. Fabric plasters. Okay, um, we'll need to X-ray him. It's one of those nights in here, so it might be a while until a doctor sees yous. - [Rose-Lynn] Okay. - [Lyle] I want my granny. - Shh, shh... - Please! I want my granny! - Please! I want my granny! - It's okay, it's okay. [curtain opening] - Are you Lyle's mum? - Aye, yeah. - Dr Yousaf. I'm sorry about the wait. - No. The X-ray looks fairly straightforward, but he'll need a cast. When can we go home? We can't get the cast on until the swelling's come down, so we are looking at a couple more hours. I'm sorry it's been such a long night. [sighs] Oh, fucking hell. - Where is he? - He's still asleep. Right. I'll take this one home and you can stay here with the wee fella. No. No. What's for you will no' go by you. Maybe 20 year in the baker's is enough for you, but it's not enough for me. Away and get me a wee cup of tea, darling. What's the matter with you? I just... I just need you to help. Help me. Help you? Help you do what? Leave him here while you go to a party? Is that the plan? I don't know what this awf'y toffy woman thinks you are, but she wouldnae give you a brass farthing if she knew the truth. You havenae even told her, have you? She doesnae even have a clue that you've got kids. If you're no' even prepared to acknowledge their existence, there's no hope for you. And there's sure as hell none for them. Go. Go to Nashville. Do whatever it is you wanna do. Come on, darling. Let's go see your wee brother.

The girl, like the city, is gallus. [crowd] Whoo! She's funny and, above all else, she's completely fearless. And with your help, she's going to Nashville to do what she was put on this earth to do.

Come on. I don't know what... what you see when you look at me, but it isnae me. - What are you talking about? - I'm not at the height of my powers. I'm not free and there's so, so much I can't undo. I can't undo going to the jail. I cannae undo chucking in heroin to all they lasses in there already fucked from drugs. And do you know what else I cannae undo? Having two kids. Two beautiful children before I was 18. Wynonna, she's eight, and Lyle, he's five, and I... I got 12 months in the jail and I left behind two kids. Yeah, that's the truth. Not this. That, them. Everything I made you think I am... I'm not. Sorry, I'm just... [dog barks in distance] [gate hinges squeak] [dog barks in distance] [chattering on TV] [Lyle groans softly] Come on.

What's this for? Why are you giving me this? I wanted you to take responsibility, but I never meant to take away your hope. I don't know what you're talking about. Maybe there is more to life or maybe there isnae. I don't know. I've never been further than Dunoon. But you need to away and see. No. I cannae start all that up again. It's finished. I always said I'd go to college if I hadnae had to go to work at 15. And I would have. I wanted to be a pharmacist. The thing is... [scoffs] what was stopping me, you know? Even after I had you, I could have gone. But I think it was just easier for me to... to want things for you than to go after them for myself. I hadnae the gumption. That's the truth. But you... you do. I'll look after the wains. You go. You see what's waiting for you. Where did you get all this money from? Amazing what you can do... 20 year in the baker's.

[vehicle horn blares] Welcome to the Ryman, the mother church of country music. This is the exact spot where bluegrass was born and where Johnny Cash met June Carter. Now, it was right here that country music found an audience beyond its own back porch and countless careers took off. Now, when the Grand Ole Opry put down roots here in 1943, the live radio and TV show brought the likes of Elvis Presley, Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Marty Robbins, Minnie Pearl, Patsy Cline, and Roy Acuff to the stage and into living rooms all around America.
