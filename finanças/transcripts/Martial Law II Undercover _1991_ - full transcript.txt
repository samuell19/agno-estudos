Well then amigo, show me your armor. Check it out. Step into my office. All right, let's see what you've got. Mack 10s, uzis, 45s, nine millimeters. Need I go on? Yeah, but are they cold? Virtually untraceable. Okay, anything goes wrong you move in on my command. I don't want any officers to intervene unless authorized. Get the hell out. Hey guys. Hey, get the hell out of here.

You understand what I'm saying? Hey! Everybody hold. Hey, check it out. Pretty good disguise, you almost fooled me today. Thanks. That was very impressive. All in day's work. Why do I get the feeling you're leading up to something? For starters, you made detective. And you've been transferred to Northwest division. When do we leave? Billie's not leaving. They want you to start a martial arts program. Besides I still need her around here. Good luck, kid. I'm gonna miss you around here. Thanks. -Hey. -All right, got it. Thank you.

Congratulations, Sean. Thanks. I hate to break up the team. Yeah, me too. But hey, now that you're on your own you got a better chance of making detective. Yeah, right. Hell, if you could do it, anybody can. Captain Krantz. Thanks. Captain Krantz, Detective Sean Thompson. Captain, requisition forms. Thanks. So you're martial law, huh?

At 24, Spencer Hamilton has achieved the kind of success many business men work their whole lives to attain. And to encourage others his age, he's just established the Hamilton Scholarship Fund for business excellence. If this were the real thing, Tanner, you'd be dead. Mr. Hamilton, to what do you attribute your success. Well, Christine, luck and determination don't hurt. Plus I have an incredible role model, my father. It was your own hard work, son. In a world where SO many parents and children find it difficult to communicate, the Hamilton family is an inspiration to us all. Christine Richards, channel 10 news. We all set for tonight, Bree? Is everything in order? Yep, everything's in order. Get out. Let's see your hands. Come on, let's go. Come on. Hey, scum! He had this. You're a real boy scout, Borelli. Who else is in on this, Frank? You'll never know. Well, I can guarantee, you're not gonna get away with it. I beg to differ. Looks like you put your nose somewhere it doesn't belong my friend. How unfortunate. Tanner. Let's go. Is this it, Frank, huh? You're gonna sell me out, man? You're gonna sell me out, Frank? This is the way you treat your brothers, right? Good move. Nice. Look at this guy. I'm gonna walk out of here, Frank. I'm gonna walk out! How'd he get onto you, Dobbs? Never mind. I know it won't happen again. Bree, this has to look right. The most powerful aspect of martial arts is the mind. Concentration against the opponent's movement is how you'll take them down quickly. Without a gun, with only your skill. Now, I'll need some volunteers. Thank you. As you can see, balance is critical in any defense. You have a question, Al? It looks like dancing in your pajamas to me. This is ridiculous. I mean, which moves stops the .357? This next move is designed to designed to disarm an attacker at closer range. Okay, now what? Bang, you're dead. You tell him, tell him, I'll turn, I'll turn, I'll turn. I have two kids and a wife, Nancy. Tell them I'll turn. I will, I'll do anything, I'll do- -So what'd you say your name was? It's Bob. Been working here long? Enjoy it? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. But the fringe benefits are great. Hmm, I can only imagine. What can you imagine? By looking at you, I'd say you're on quite a healthy plan. Yeah, I'm very healthy. Spencer, thanks for the loan. I thought I was gonna have to quit school. My pleasure, consider it a gift. Oh, I can't accept that. Well, there is a way you can work it off if you'd like. I could use another girl in here, just to be nice to the customers. Celeste. It's not what you think. I don't use my girls that way. I only need them to talk to the clients, be friendly. And let me know any interesting information you might hear along the way, that's all. Consider this just a little advance. I guess I could use a few nights. Besides I could use a break from studying. When do I start? How about right now? Frank, glad you could make it. Please enjoy the champagne with my compliments. Here's someone who's dying to meet the biggest sports promoter in the business. Frank Jones, may present to you Celeste. Charmed. She'll be at my private party on Saturday. I hope you'll be able to make it. Wouldn't dare miss it. Well, excuse me please. But it's still a million bucks. Tiffany. Who the hell is this? Spencer Hamilton, the owner. Perhaps you've got too much to drink. I'll have the bartender call you a cab. Your drinks are on the house, sir. Much obliged. Excuse us, Heather. Thank you. So who's the new girl? Celeste. Well, I guess some guys like that type. I don't want you wasting your time with that guy anymore. There are more important people that you should be working with. Give me a break. Look, I'm not in the mood for this tonight. You're on thin ice, lady. Well, good thing I know how to skate. Rebellious, isn't she. All units, all units, one car, CA, off Malibu Canyon Road. Body has been identified as Officer Borelli, Daniel Jay. Units stand by, coroner has been notified. What are you doing here, Thompson? I heard on my scanner. What happened? Looks like Danny was loaded and missed the curve. What? Drunk driving. He told me he quit drinking. Yeah, well Danny said lots of stuff. Look, the evidence is there, it's that simple. Well? It doesn't look good. Hey, he fell off the wagon. A lot of people do, it cost him. Yeah, but why? I don't know. Danny's been confused. I heard he flunked the sergeant exam. Who knows? Yeah, who knows. Look, there's no reason to believe it's anything else. Yeah, shit, you're probably right. I'll see you back at the station. I'm not denying it. Borelli was a good cop. Captain, we have a meeting in 15 minutes. Yeah, thank you, Edwards. But he had a problem, and that problem finally caught up to him. He told me he was dry, Captain, and I believe him. Now somethin's not right. I understand how you feel. I've lost a number of good friends, and that's the hardest part of the job. Listen, I'm telling you he. This report seems clear. We'll wait, and we'll see if the coroner's report verifies it, but in the meantime, you're just gonna have to back off a little bit. -Back off, Captain- -I am late for a division meeting. Now that's it, Detective. Hey, hey, hey. Look at this. Come on man, get her. Hey! Mall security! Al little late, guys. And I'm supposed to be on vacation. What are you drinking? -I'll have a beer. -You got it. Keep the change. Thanks. First time? Yeah, a buddy of mine comes here a lot, told me about it. Maybe you know him, Danny Borelli. No, it doesn't ring a bell. May I help you? Excuse me? We have a large clientele here, an exclusive clientele that values their privacy. I'm sure you do, and I respect that. Now do you mind? He's about 5'10", dark hair. You don't seem to understand. We can't help you here. You got a bad habit of interrupting. I think it's time for you to leave. I haven't finished my beer. Yes you have. Don't touch me. That's enough. I said. Get up! Get against the wall, put your hand behind your head, and interlace your fingers. Let him go. -What? -He's a cop. What are you doing here, Dobbs? What am I doing here? I'm supposed to ask you that, Thompson. Hi, beautiful. Hey, stranger. You're workin' late. Yeah, one final report, and I'm on vacation. Well, come on, get changed, and I'll buy ya beer. Yeah. Danny Borelli, can you believe it? I heard, it's such a shame. I was at the scene and somehow things don't add up. What do you mean? It looked like a DUI but Danny told me he quit drinking, and I believe him. And this, this other detective Dobbs keeps poppin' up. I mean everywhere. You're not gonna let this go, are you? Danny deserves that at least, don't you think? What do you want me to do? You're on vacation. Come on. Well, there is a little something. I found that in Danny's car. Club Syntax. Did you check it out? I sort of blew my cover. You're fuckin' unbelievable, Thompson, you know that! I'm not finished with you. You created a scene in a nightclub! No assault charges were filed, thank God. I was following a lead on Borelli's death. Yeah, Borelli was drunk. 1.6, twice the legal limit, case closed. No case. And if you keep this up, you're gonna end up on parade duty until your goddamn retirement! Hi. Hello. Never thought I regret saying this, but we're closed. Well, that's okay. I'm lookin' for a job. You need any bartenders? Well, it depends. On what? How good are you? Try me. Mai Tai. Light rum, orange juice, pineapple juice, grenadine, float it with dark rum. Okay, Long Island ice tea. Five whites, vodka, rum, gin, tequila, coke, sweet and sour, topped with Triple Sec. Cookie Monster. Cookie Monster. Ha, got you. Creme de coco, creme de mint, vodka, lit on fire, run like hell. Very good, very good. You're having fun, George? No, Mr. Tanner, I was just interviewing her for a job. She's pretty good. Guess we're working you to hard, huh? No, I, uh, could use a little extra help on the weekends, and we do have a couple of big nights comin' up. What's your name? Kathy Swan. Where have you worked before? Here, there, mostly downtown. Any place I might know? Well, nowhere this nice. But look, if you want references I- -No, no, why don't we try you out tonight see how you do, and we'll work from there, okay? -Great. -George, why don't you show her around? Make sure she knows what she's doing. Yes, sir. I don't think it was an accident, Nancy. Was there anything unusual lately? Was he having any problems at work? Well, he did seem frustrated lately. About two weeks ago he came home very upset. I had to pry it out of him, but he said, "Someone was trying to meddle with an arrest.” I tried to get him to talk to me, but that's all he would say. Did he say who? No, he refused to talk about it. I thought it was over. Sean, you have to find out what happened. Please. How are ya? Sean Thompson. Dickens. What can I do for ya? I need to pull a file on a Michaels, Tiffany arrested June 4. Nothing in here. Maybe there's a hard copy. No file. You sure? Yeah, she got a AKA or something? No, that's the name? Could it be somewhere else now? No, this is central. If it's not in here she hasn't been booked. All right, thanks. Well, it's about time you got here? Yeah. You picked the sunny side of the street, huh? I start at the club tonight. Great. Saw Nancy today. How's she holding up? Pretty good. That's good. There's really sometin' weird going on. What? Well, she told me, Danny was really messed up because someone was checking out his cases. So I pulled his files. He'd arrested this girl at Club Syntax. But get this, there's no record of it at central. There's gotta be some connection, right. Listen, why don't you check it out and see what you can dig up. Do you know the name of the girl? Tiffany, Tiffany Michaels. -I'll check it out. -All right. Oh, Billie, listen Krantz found out I was workin' on this, just make sure you don't get caught or it'll be both our asses. You know you act like a little old lady sometimes. Sometimes I feel like a little old lady. Yeah, grandpa. Spencer. Hi. Why don't you come by later, we're having a party. Enjoying yourself, Frank? Great place you got here. I like to throw an interesting party. By the way, I've arranged a little event later that I think you might really enjoy. What is it? It's a surprise. It's for my very special guests only. Yeah, guys, well, I gotta get a drink. Champagne. The good stuff. So you having a good time tonight? Oh, yeah. You're new here, right? Yeah. First night? Kathy Swan. Tiffany Michaels. Nice to meet you, Kathy. So are you a dancer? No, no, I'm not a dancer. I'm one of Spencer's collectors. Collectors? People, favors, things like that. I make sure Spencer gets what he wants, when he wants it, and how he wants it. Well, he seems like a nice guy. Spencer. Yeah, he's great as long as you deliver. Jesus. Kathy, isn't it? No more drinks for the lady tonight. I wanna talk to you. Oh, right now. Would you let go you're hurting me. There's someone important I need you to talk to. I suppose you want me to sleep with him too, right? And make him fall in love with me. I'm tired of all of this. You're tired of it? Well, you're not tired of all the benefits are you? You're gonna do what I want when I want it, and you'll like it. Watch your mouth. Yes, sir. Spencer, everything's ready. Be careful, Tiffany. Party breaking up early? They'll be back. Where'd they go? Some things around here that you just don't get into. Well, I hope Tiffany's okay, she seemed rather upset. Tiffany'll be fine, just as long as she keeps her mouth shut, and so will you. Right up my alley, Spencer. I thought so. Watch the one in blue. Excellent style. Not bad. You know, I've been thinking of getting in the promotion game myself. Really? It's a tough racket. Yes, I thought you might help me. I had a little head start in mind. And what's that? Well, a certain someone tells me you're a gambling man. So am I. I'll put my man against your man. My man wins I get your business for 10 million. 10 million? It's worth twice that. Your man wins you get my club. Which one's your man, the one in blue? Tanner. Your two men. You are on, Hamilton. You are on. I think I'm gonna enjoy the nightclub business. Come on. Bring it. Get up sucka, bring it. Get up. Get up! That was a hell of a fight. Oh, man. I'm surprised he didn't kill him. 10 million. You got one week. Spencer I have a question. Where are we gonna get 10 million? Bree, Why don't you take everybody back to the club? Tanner, I don't underestimate you, don't you underestimate me. Tiffany, why don't you tell me more about this young man Rick. You Rick? Yeah. Tiffany wants to talk to you. Yeah, I know, who are you? I'm your ride, get in. Wait, wait, what's this about? Just get in. What the hell is going on here? I need some information, Rick. Oh, yeah, what? My people tell me your involved in a certain transaction soon. Look, no way. Al right. I got nottin' to tell ya. Look, Rick, I don't wanna hurt you. After all, any friend of Tiffany's is a friend of mine. I don't know what the hell you're talking about, man. Don't be stupid, Rick. What are you kidding? Tell me what I want, I'll let you walk out of here right down. If I talk they'll kill me! You talk. Really this is your last chance. No, no. Now the other. No, God no, no. Big deal, big deal, three days, three days. It's a 10, $12 million deal. Where, Rick? Saddle's Peak, Saddle's Peak. Please. You may let him go. And what if he talks? You heard him, they'll kill him. This is a big deal, Spencer. You know, they're gonna have an army there. We'll have our own army. George, have you seen Spencer? No. Good, I need a break. Well, hello. Long time no care. I gotta tell ya, you look too good to ignore. Well, it's been really nice seeing you too, but the old clock on the wall says it's time for you to fuck off. Come on, let's go some place private. I'm not interested. I'm not gonna hurt you. Hey, leave her alone. When I want a drink I'll ask. It's time to leave. Sure. Come on let's go. Let go of me, let go! Would you wait a second? Out alone. Apologize to the lady. I'm sorry. No problem. What a jerk. -Let's get out of here. -Oh, God. Thanks. So how long have you been with him? -Spencer? -Mm-hmm. I guess it's been about three years. Well, that's a long time. You must really like it. The only problem is Spencer wants to make all my choices. What kind of choices? About the guys I date. But I have this plan to remind him how valuable I am to him. There's a certain guy that's crazy about me. I bet he's not the only guy. Well, I'll tell you this he's very powerful. And if Spencer doesn't watch out I'll be controlling him. So tell me, do you really love this guy? Do I love him? Well, he loves me. I like him a lot. You know Tiffany, if it gets rough, maybe you could go back home. Do your parents live around here? No. They died in a car accident when I was a kid. I'm sorry. Nope, I'm on my own now, but I'll do just fine. So how long have you been a bartender? Well, my dad used to own a bar, so it was sort of like in the family business. I think I was about six years old when I learned how to make my first Mai Tai. Where are you from? Scranton, Pennsylvania. -Yeah? -Yeah. How'd you hear about Spencer's club? Well I, ugh, can you believe this jerk? You back for more? Jesus. Step off to the side? Come on tough guy. Geez, Louise. There's been a cop at the club asking questions. Sean Thompson. I've already got Dobbs working on it. Good. Tiffany sends her love. And when do I get to see her again? Soon. I have some information for you, a big drug deal, times, dates, and places. And why are you telling me all this? My civic duty, Captain. Think of the headlines, big dealer bust. What is in it for you? You get the drugs and the glory, and I get the cash. You're crazy. The answer is no. Haven't I always treated you right, Captain? You wanna go back to that lousy cop salary, and ugly ex-wife? It's too much, Spencer. I'd be going too far. It'd have to murder for god's sake. I'm out. And I don't care who you tell about Tiffany and me. I won't cross the line, I'm out. You're out when I say you're out. Until then you're in. You'll do what I want. You'll see, Captain. Go for the groin or you go for the throat. -Yeah. -Well, how's my favorite girl? Spenc, you should have seen Kathy tonight, she beat up three guys. Yes, I heard, Bree told me. Very impressive. I could use another pair of hands around here. How would you like a job? I already have one. Ah, that's right a bartender. That must be very, very boring for someone with your skills. Not really. Why, what'd you have in mind? I have a big night coming up, I'm gonna need a few extra people to help out Tanner and Bree. I like my people capable of handling themselves. Do you mean a bouncer? Yeah, something like that. I just need someone who knows when to jump in and help out. And it'd mean a nice raise. Sure, sounds interesting. Okay. Yeah, Detective Sean Thompson. I've got some information about Borelli. Who is this? A friend. Meet me at The Coast. Tell me what you got. No, in person. You ask for Lenny. Listen, if you tell me what you got. -Yeah. -Looking for Lenny. Hold it right there. Who set it up, huh? Fuck you, man. Who, who? Fuck you, man. Okay, okay, man. Some guy came in, gave me a grand, and told me what to say. What'd he look like? He looked like a fuckin' cop. Oh this is different. It's cute. And here's my favorite section. This is beautiful. It's great. What do you think? I love it. I'm gonna buy it for you. Tiffany, it's 300 bucks. Don't worry, I have Spencer's credit card. Okay. Look. Oh, look at this. Spencer's being generous. He hasn't gotten the bill yet. It's just my way of making sure he remembers how much I'm worth to him. Here you go. -Thank you. -Thanks. -Thanks. -Buh-bye. Buh-bye. Billie, it's Sean. Hi, what's up. I followed a tip today and got jumped. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Sean. No really. Was it a setup? I got a pretty good idea of who it was but no proof. Who? Dobbs. Dobbs. What's next? Get proof. Billie, be careful. Yeah, you too. Bye. So what do you think? I think that you look fantastic. But I wish I were the one buying you the nice things. I don't mean things like these, I mean like this apartment. It's nice, but that's not what I care about. Besides, it comes with Spencer. Spencer. The only nice thing that he ever did in his whole life was introduce us. Do you ever think about just disappearing? Going some place else, just starting all over? Well, I know somewhere we can go tonight. Why don't you go ahead and I'll get the drinks. He's out. Whatever you're up to this stinks. Emotions, Tiffany, emotions. They really do get in the way of the business. No more, I'm sick of your twisted games. I've had enough of this, Spencer, I want out. You really think you can just walk away from this? I did what you asked me to do, now let me go. You know something I agree with you, I really do. What? What are you doing? You said you weren't gonna hurt him. Well, this isn't for him. You bastard. You killed her. I'm afraid you've already run out of bullets. This is gonna make an interesting story, don't you think? Police captain murders mistress in love nest. The tabloids are gonna love it. Of course, Tanner will keep the photos and evidence well-hidden. Now you are going to do everything I ask. You have no choice. There's a little matter of a drug bust and $10 million. I think Friday night will work well. Oh yes, Dobbs tells me that Thompson got away. Don't worry, I'll take care of that myself. What a mess. Clean up a little before you go, will you? Han, Spencer. Dobbs screwed up. I want the cop eliminated, he's getting too close. Now, tonight. How about a workout? Yeah, what the hell. Have you seen Tiffany? Tanner? Oh, yes I have. She left this morning. She said something about going to visit her parents, I believe. That's nice. Do you have something you could be doing, George? I left something in my car, I'll be right back. Okay. Believe me, it's not here. I've looked through every file. Hang on a sec. Detective Thompson. I think something's happened to Tiffany. I don't have much time, so can you check it out. Sure, yeah, I'll get right on it. Okay, I'll see you then. Yes. Well look who it is. Can I help you again, officer? Does Tiffany Michaels live here. No, no she doesn't. You mind if I take a look. That depends, you got a warrant? What's a little piece of paper between friends. Dick. Did you find Tiffany? No, but I ran into an old friend. Blonde that works at the club, said, "Tiffany wasn't there." Bree. Bree, who's that? One of Spencer's bodyguards. Something's going on soon. Spencer has me on hold. Yeah, well, Tiffany's arrest file's gone. And now she's gone. How's it connect? Dobbs is the key. But listen, stay in close. Keep your eyes and ears on Spencer. I'll work on Dobbs. A messenger just dropped off this letter. I want Thompson out of the way once and for all. Yes, Captain. Listen, I think our friend Dobbs has become a liability. Good. Yes, immediately. Yes. Then we'll take it from there. You have work to do. Goodnight, Captain. We've got two teams. Dove, your people go in the front. Johnny, your team comes in the back. Now this is a big deal, and we expect maximum resistance, so everybody take all precautions. I want all of you coming back in one piece, okay? Sean, I want you and Frank to be in charge of moving any evidence. Sure. Just you and me, Thompson. -Pay day. -Thanks. Listen up people. The club will be closed tonight. I've got a very special transaction and I want everybody there. What about me? Yeah, you too. We're going at nine o'clock sharp. Hey, chico, it's all there, all right. At least nine million. Now we count the last box. We got a problem? Go ahead, what? Okay, start counting. Everybody, report in the instant that you're in position. We're ready. Let's do it. Come on, go, go, go, go, go. Hey! Get out of here run. Up against the wall! Move it, move it! -Spread your legs, come on. -Spread 'em. Up against the wall now! Are you Rick? Yeah. Spencer says thanks. All right, let's get these guys up and into the truck. What happened out there? One of them drew down, I popped him. Take the van and you go straight to headquarters. They just went by. So what's the deal? Just a little trade. Nothing for you to worry about. What kind of trade? A van is going to arrive with some boxes. You will help put those boxes into a car. That is all you need to know. Okay. It's on its way. Good, call Jones, tell him one hour. Hey, Dobbs. Mind if I ask you a question? Shoot. How long you been dirty? How long I have been dirty? Hey, that's a good one. No, really, I wanna know, how long? Ever since I got smart, Thompson. You think a straight guy gets ahead? What happened to Borelli? He was poking around where he didn't belong, just like you. I'm taking you down, Dobbs. Get a fuckin' life. You know how deep this goes? You're gonna take down Krantz too? Yeah, see you think you know everything, don't ya wise guy? What the? Put it down. You think you're gonna pull this off, Dobbs? Sure, two cops get ambushed, one gets tragically killed, suspects get away with the money, but I get a medal anyway. Han, shoot him. I got different orders. You're not very good at this, are ya? Okay, tough guy, You're gonna be my guide. Let's go. You could be a part of this. Spencer's real generous with his cops. Yeah, I've seen how he treats his cops. Shut up and drive. They're here! Looks like we're in business. Looks that way. You must be officer Thompson. You're very annoying. Tell them to drop their guns or this guy's history. Go ahead. I've got an idea, you give up and we'll kill you. Nice suit. Go for it, Spencer. It's far from over cop! We're talking 10 million. Only the winner keeps the cash. Sean! Billie, Captain Krantz was in on it.
