The Roberts Meteor will be in full view within the hour as it passes between the moon and the earth. This is the closest an encounter to an object this size the planet has ever experienced. Initial concerns of impact were highly misrepresented. As with a meteor of this magnitude, an impact would almost certainly be a global killer. NASA and other space agencies worldwide were quick to put to rest the rumors of an impact event and said, instead, this would be a unique opportunity to study and see a meteor this close. Uncle Ed. Hi Jules. What are you doin' up this late? I'm going to watch the comet fly by. It's a meteor, possum. Oh. Ed? Oh, it's almost four a.m. What's happening? I thought you'd be watching the Roberts Meteor pass by in all its glory. Well, to tell you the truth, my alarm was about ready to go off. Now, are you calling just to wake me up? I'm your alarm, Grandma. I was going to wake you up. All right, I know. Now, what is it you need, Ed? Gonna send you some numbers. I need some verification. What kind of verification? Trajectory. Trajectory? Well, here it is. What trajectory am I checking on? A mega-cryo meteor. Is that like the Roberts Meteor? Well, here's the Roberts Meteor. Trajectory has already been established. So, what am I looking for? Just double check the numbers. They're not the same as NASA has been giving out to us. Well, where did you get these calculations? Could I help? I'm really good at math. I made some adjustments to the size and mass. I'm just not following you, Ed. We know it's been getting smaller and it's been losing mass since it was first discovered. It's also heating up because it's getting closer to the sun. And the ice is melting. Exactly. Look, based on the size of Roberts at its point of origin versus its size on day 15, versus its size today, I've recalculated the trajectory. You mean they have known about this for three months? Well, we could have done something. We can't dig deep enough. So this is how the world is going to end? Yeah. It's a global killer. Full view for a few hours and of course, just as with any of the past end of the world scenarios, such as 2012 Mayan calendar or the Y2K bug, people around the world are celebrating their final day on Earth. Now, let's hear how some of those people are spending their final hours. Let's start with Hollywood socialite, RJ Malone. RJ, thanks for joining us. Thank you very much. Well, we all know about your celebrity laden parties. Is that what you'll be doing tonight? Well, I'll be having a small soiree, just a few hundred of my very closest friends. That's sounds incredibly exciting, RJ. And what can we expect to be happening at the Malone Villa tonight? A party of titanic proportions. After all, we're all going down with the ship. Thank you, RJ, now let's check in with the rest of the world. Well, I think I'm gonna take my wife, our dogs, a bunch of alcohol and our guns out and do some drinkin' and shootin'. What would I do with my last day on Earth? I wouldn't do anything different. There is no meteor. It's a conspiracy. The government's just fucking with us. My whole life I've had to work, long commutes, back-breaking work. So, what am I going to be doing with my final day? I'm going to live. I don't know. Probably spend it with friends, family, stockpiling drinks, food. There's always a chance you'll survive. Drink your vodka before your beer and you're in the clear to do whatever it is you want to do before the meteor hits and if doesn't, I wake up from a drunken stupor again. It is a conspiracy. The world ain't gonna end. It's the fucking government trying to scare us, that's all. If the world were to end tomorrow, I would gather my family and friends and take them out for a nice steak dinner and pound some whiskey. So, what am I going to do? I'm gonna get up there, I'm gonna bang my wife. I'm gonna bang her so damn hard she won't even know what hit her and then I'm gonna slit her throat so she doesn't have to face it. Greetings citizens of the world. Today marks the end of humanity. We have been lied to and deceived. World governments have conspired to hide the fact that the Roberts Meteor will collide with the earth, bringing about an extinction level event, making the planet uninhabitable for all forms of life. This will be our final message. The end game is now inevitable. Farewell. This is Justice Outlaw calling out to Haunted Forest. Is anyone reading me, over. This is the Haunted Forest. I read you loud and clear, over. Copy that. You all set over there, if this turns into a long winter? I think so, I hope so. How are things lookin' on your end? Oh, we're doin' okay. What are your numbers comin' in at? We're at five, maybe a few more on the way. Copy that, we're maxed out here. We got about 11. We got some extended family and lots of kids. I hear ya. Now, take care of those kids, Outlaw, over. Copy that. Looks like the show's about to begin. I guess I'll see ya on the other side of Armageddon. Billy, where the hell are ya, man? Yo, get your ass up here. I'm in the shithouse. Just making sure everything's ready for the zombie apocalypse. You're gonna miss all the action, Billy boy. We're gettin' ready for the magic hour. All right, Gordo. I'm heading out now. It's getting near 4:30. When's this thing gonna happen? Any minute now. Social media is exploding. It's happening up there, Cass, in the real clouds, not on your phone. Where've you been? Givin' some love to the critters in the creep house? I saved that for you, Gordo. I was just makin' sure everything works. Who cares if the animatronics are running right now? I'm not worried about the animatronics, Ida. I'm worried about the HVAC, the power, water purification, air filtration, sanitation. Ain't there some kind of potion and the bomb shelter? It is a bomb shelter and when the world ends in a few hours, we're gonna owe our lives to Billy, and Grandpa Hobb for saving our asses. That's right. No B.S., boys and girls. Gramps built a 6,000 square foot bomb shelter in the 50s. The family always kept it goin'. I did a few updates over the last few months when all this news came down. Did you really bring the supplies? Sure, of course, four duffel bags' worth. I only see one, I see that. That's the most important one. The others are in my car. What's in that one? You know, soap, shampoo, hand sanitizer, first aid, medicine, antibiotics, and razors, lots and lots of razors. Gotta keep that lid nice and smooth. Even in the apocalypse, it's important to keep clean and look good. What kind of supplies did you bring? You know, just the basics, toilet paper, tampons, paper towels, plenty of clothes and a few thousand rounds of ammunition. What kind of gun do you have? I don't have a gun, just a shit ton of ammo. It's the new world order. When the economy collapses, money won't be worth a thing. Ammo is gonna be serious currency. And seeds. Why do we need seeds? We're preparing for a mass extinction. Everything we're lookin' at up here could be dead this time tomorrow, covered in a radioactive wasteland and the darkness of dust clouds that will kill every living thing on the surface. So, seeds don't matter if everybody's dead anyway. We're going to live in Billy's bomb shelter. Haven't you guys been listening to anything? We can grow vegetables with hydroponics, right Billy? If we need to. I didn't hook the system up yet, but we have time, if we survive. Survive? I thought the news said we were fine. Isn't that why we're out here? Just watch the meteor pass by? You haven't been listening to anything I've been saying? I've been preparing for the end of the world. Did you two guys bring anything? Your bags? Anything? I brought beers, chips. That's it? We thought you were kidding. I've been preparing for the end of days and you two brought beer and chips? Way to go. Shouldn't even let you guys in the shelter. You're not going to let us in? We'll die out here, Billy. Wendi, you designed some of the scariest things in this haunt but I can't believe how dense you can be. Of course I'm gonna let you in. Thank you. Yeah, thank you, Billy. So, are your mom and dad coming out soon? I told you to bring Glenn and Cindy. We have to go get them. Straight to their house and back, no pit stops. There and back, that's it. Don't even pack, no time. Go! There and back, you dumbasses! There and back, that's it! They won't make it back if this happens. Probably not. They're going to pack, and go shopping and be incinerated in the first shock wave. Let's hope not. I hope for a lot of things to not happen, but I'm pretty sure this will. End of days. It's scary to think about. Terrifying. Easier to make jokes about it than to really consider the possibilities. There's still some time. Anybody you two wanna invite? Right now it's just the three of us. I drove everybody away years ago. So, it goes for a former addict. You been better to me, Billy, than any of my family ever was. Always, Gordo, always. Me, too, fellas. I mean, ostracism never treated me too well. I'm looking at family. Three generations of my family have been working on this, waiting, for this, I guess. Sorry, I missed the funeral, bud. Never told you that. You didn't have to. I understand. I'm sorry, too. You were there, Cassie, or did you forget? Of course I didn't forget. I loved your parents. I'm just fucking depressed right now. I'm trying not to fall apart. We're all feeling the same way. We just have different ways of showing it. This shelter of yours, this Xanadu... Oh, don't get confused. This ain't no Shangri-La. It's still a creepy ass haunt down there, it just happens to be a haunted house outfitted for survival. I will take it. I have never been looking for paradise, anyway. Tell me about our new home. How are we gonna live for two years without water? We have water. There's a 10,000 gallon water reclamation tank for starters, and a 5,000 gray water filtration system. And we have a 900 gallon water purification system for everyday use and we have two thousand-gallon clean water storage tanks. Hot showers and drinking water at your fingertips. How we set for power? Oh, that's where it gets exciting. Mom and Dad prepared for every possibility. Then batteries, a whole lot of batteries. More batteries than bullets. I got a lot of bullets. Pow pow, pow pow. Me, too. We have more batteries. What else? 12-volt deep cycle batteries, propane and natural gas generators, have some solar hooked up. What's that rig your dad was building in the barn? It's a Co2 smokehouse. What's that for? Smokin' meats? Naw, man. My dad loved doing this stuff, but he didn't ever really believe that we'd have a nuclear war, or get hit by an asteroid. He did think, however, there was a damn good chance of climate change ending it all. That smokehouse was his passion project. So, what's the Co2 smokehouse, then? It converts greenhouse gases into energy. Cleans up carbon dioxide. That rig in there can suck Co2 out of the air, power our shelter and filter fresh oxygen into the HVAC. It's an amazing system. He designed it. Edison and a company in Japan are, were, working on ones big enough to power cities. Well, let's turn that bad boy on. Don't need it. If a meteor hits, we'll have to worry about heat, radiation and fallout. Who are you people? Gramps and my dad were certified geniuses. My granddad worked with Oppenheimer to develop the first atomic bomb. That's why this shelter was so important to him. My dad had a passion for clean energy. That Co2 smokehouse was gonna be his magnum opus. Maybe we should turn it on, anyway, you know, just in case. Here it is, guys. Someone from NASA is making an announcement. I speak on behalf of not only NASA, but the President of the United States and many other world governments. The Roberts Meteor is coming into view of half the world as I deliver this message. Now, initially we had indicated that this object would pass by the earth, leaving us unharmed. We lied. We lied to all of you. This is it. We are done. In approximately 28 minutes, the meteor will enter the earth's atmosphere. Six minutes after that, the Roberts Meteor will collide with the earth somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, in the southern hemisphere between the South American and African continents. I'm not sure what kind of difference this shelter is gonna make. In the best case scenario, our rockets will break apart the meteor, lessening the worldwide destruction. In the worse case scenario, the impact will be felt worldwide. The initial shockwave will devastate most of the southern hemisphere and within eight hours, the entire world will be covered by a toxic cloud of radioactive dust that will not dissipate for many years. This is really depressing. While there will initially be survivors, temperatures will continue to rise, making it impossible to live above, or even below the surface. Not even bacteria will survive. We're all gonna die. Let's go, time to put this place on lockdown. I'm petrified. I don't know what to do. That's not the news I wanted to hear, Gordo, but the news I heard says we still have a chance. NASA said bacteria won't even survive. They also said we will survive the impact. Let's focus on that for now. I haven't even told ya the half of what we have in here. There's the air filtration systems. That's right, I said systems. We have oxygen tanks, hazmat suits, emergency communications and security cameras. We're going camping folks, and it's gonna be fun. Oh, thank God. Here's a nice surprise. I didn't know if you were gonna make it back, Ida. Where's the rest of your family? I brought all of our stuff. You packed? I told you not to pack. Get them and get back, that's it. Where are they? Just tell him, Ida. They went shopping, Billy. They wanted to contribute. Didn't you watch the news? Should I go get them? No, goddammit, you're staying right here. And we're gonna hope for the best. What's happening on the news? I mean, you know, other than the obvious. I don't know. Let me turn up the sound. Sorry it's not a little more cozy in here. Hey, I love this place. The world has erupted in chaos since the NASA announcement just a short time ago. We can only assume the world was misled to avoid exactly this type of global reaction for months, rather than minutes. My parents, my sister. They'll be here any minute, Ida, okay? Now, with the Roberts Meteor about to penetrate the earth's atmosphere, will continue to broadcast as long as we can remain on the air. We are now receiving reports of bright, burning lights as the meteor collides with the atmosphere. I'm told we have satellite coverage of the event. I'm not sure what's occurring, exactly. It just looks so bright. We are receiving unsubstantiated reports from both the military and NASA that the atmosphere is causing the meteor to melt and crumble. We've lost our image. We'll see if we can find another. World governments are making united efforts to launch missiles in efforts to break apart the meteor, as well. We are hearing now that the Roberts Meteor has exploded upon entering the atmosphere. Now, the bulk of the meteor has vaporized or been shattered into smaller pieces. Thousands of smaller rocks will likely be impacting most of the planet. Explosions have caused electro-magnetic pulses, shutting down communications in most of the southern hemisphere. We can expect a worldwide power outage soon that will disable most electronics and machine operated vehicles. The shelter's been reinforced to withstand pulses, but let's be safe and shut everything down before the initial blow. Start scanning channels and see what you can find. I'll turn everything else off and check the doors. We're going to be fine, right? Strictly precautionary. I'll turn it all back on when the shock waves are done from the initial strikes. Strikes? More than one? That's what they said, Ida. One big one and thousands of smaller ones. Don't worry, we're ready. We'll be fine. A large solid rock has emerged from the cloud, and is still on a collision course with the earth. It is heading for the Atlantic Ocean. The impact will be devastating. But perhaps not as bad as originally indicated. An enormous gaseous cloud is filling the southern part of the world and it's spreading quickly. Nothin'. Don't quit. Let me try. I think maybe you're going a little too fast. Some type of cloud is spreading. I'm hearing, of course, that it's toxic radiation, maybe Co2. What's the news? Better than expected. Sort of. We're watching this cloud rollin' in. Looks like fog. Comin' right at us. Into the house. There's no where where we can hide. That could be Co2 melting away. They said this meteor was a giant mass of carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gas. I need to power up right away. Take care, take shelter. Get underground. Some people may still survive. What's with chemical warfare suit? Are we about to get poisoned? I need to turn the smokehouse on. Wait, you need to go out to the barn? We need that smokehouse pumping fresh oxygen. You were right, Gordo. We should have turned that thing on. Wendi? Billy, that you? You're not lookin' too hot there, hon. We went to the store to get supplies. You should have just come back. I know, Billy, I know. What happened? We got some stuff, but, people had guns, knives, bats. They just started killing each other. Where are your parents? They got killed at the car. I started running. I had a big bag of batteries, good ones. I almost made it. They shot me. Took my batteries. Are those my guts? I don't know. Am I going to die? You're gonna be fine. I'm gonna get you inside. We're good, see? Survived the first wave, impact. What's next? You were right. The chatter's talking about a giant Co2 cloud and an electro-magnetic pulses shutting down the power grids. Well, what about radiation? Dust clouds? Sounds like they're comin'. Most of the southern hemisphere will be lost. We'll get the fallout the next few hours. The air will remain radioactive indefinitely, but the dust should settle in North America. Well, that means we'll have sunlight. That's good. We'll survive. Others will survive. There you are. We've been looking all over for you. Hey guys, I found Ida. We're just hanging in the spinner. Everything's fine. Over, out. I have no idea what I'm supposed to say in this thing. Here, this one's yours. I need to find Wendi and my parents. I need to leave. It's not safe right now, Ida. None of us can leave. They may have gone back home. I need to check on them. You can't leave, Ida. There's a fog outside and it's filled with radiation. And the air is unbreathable. You've got those suits, though. Between the Co2 and the radiation, they won't be enough, and this place is sealed. You open a door right now, you could kill all of us. We have a cellar at the house. They're probably in there. It's not like this place, but... Keep them safe for a little while, right? Yeah, sure. You have to... I have to tell you something, hon, and, this isn't gonna be easy. What is it, Billy? They didn't make it. Didn't make it? What do you mean? How do you know this? We're alive, they could be alive. They're dead. I'm sorry, Ida, I'm so sorry. How do you know this? Cassie, what's he talking about? Listen to him, Ida. I am so sorry. They were ambushed at the store. They didn't make it out. Who told you this? Wendi. It was Wendi. Outside, well, where is she? Let's get her in. She was shot, bad. She died. No, she might still be alive. I have to help her. You can't. She's dead. I'm so sorry, Ida, I'm so sorry. No, no, I have to see her. I have to see her. Call Gordo, block the exits. We can't let her out. Gordo. Gordo! Ida, stop! Come on! I'm on my way. Ida, stop! Ida, come back! I'm at the emergency exit. Copy that, stay put. Gordo, she's heading your way. Meet me in the shithouse, over. It's okay, Ida. Just stop running, all right? Oh, you little bitch! Goddammit, God. What happened? Son of bitch, she hit me. Oh, God. I'm okay, go, go! If she opens anything she should kill us all! Ida, stop. You open that door, Ida, we all die. You got a gun, Billy? Did you shoot Wendi? Of course not, but I can't let you open that door. I have to, Wendi needs my help. No, you don't. We wait until the cloud drops, then we go outside to get her, you and me, we'll bury your sister. What about my parents? I don't know. We'll find them if we can. They could still be alive. They're not. Wendi told me. She saw. You didn't see it. You didn't see it, they could be alive, and they need me. Wendi needs my help. I can't let you open that door, Ida. You're going to shoot me? Don't make me choose. Well, you're going to have to. I'm sorry, Billy. Had to be done. You weren't gonna do it, right? No. I tried, but, I couldn't. There wasn't a choice, right? That's what I had to do. There wasn't a choice. Holy, oh, fuck. Why did you kill her? She was a kid! If she opened that door, we'd all die of radiation poisoning. But did you have to kill her? I shot her, not Billy. Why didn't you shoot her in the leg or hold her or pick her up or anything else? There wasn't time! I just pulled the trigger. Been a long time since I've killed someone. What are you doing there, Billy? Billy? Billy! Had to make sure we're okay. We're okay. You're fine. Had to make sure that the bullet didn't go through the door and that radiation wasn't coming in. You've got Ida's brains on your hand. Door stopped the bullet. That's really fuckin' gross. This is really far from okay. I just killed Ida. You had to. I coulda shot her in the leg, like you said. Well, there wasn't enough time and you saved us, Gordon. That's right. You saved us, Gordo. Oh, man. Did I... Just... Hey, uh... Ugh! You just had Ida's brains on your face. I guess it's just the three of us, now. Humanity's only hope. Well, if that's the case, I think that humanity dies with us, because, I don't have any intention of re-populating the earth with either one of you. So, what do we do with her? Can we leave her somewhere? Bury her in the house? No, she'll decompose, stink up the place. Bring disease and bugs, rats or viruses survived. What about the cemetery or the sand pit on the forest trail? That's outside, out there. I just killed Ida so she wouldn't go out there. We'll have to wait a few days, for the dust to settle. Then I can suit up, check radiation and Co2 levels and bury both of 'em, Wendi too. What if it's longer? What are we supposed to do with the body in the meantime? We have garbage bags. We wrap her up. I don't think she'll fit in garbage bag. So, are you saying, we'd have to... Yeah, we'd have to. We just killed Ida and now you're saying we need to chop up her body and put it in garbage bags? Did the end of the world just turn us into serial killers? I can't easily carry two bodies into the forest. There has got to be a better way. We need to get this mess cleaned up, get rid of the body. Do you have a better idea? I thought your family was prepared for everything? What's the plan for a dead body? Never had one. The idea was to stay alive. Fine. I will get paper towels and plastic bags, but I will not chop Ida up. I know, I'll do that. Bring a lot of paper towels! I brought these. I don't know what you'll be needing them for. I won't be needing anything. I thought of something else. Oh really, what's that? I have a wheel-barrel. It's just outside this door, actually. Huh, that... That's a much better idea. Kind of obvious. I wasn't thinking straight. None of us were. And this is only just starting. We're gonna have to keep each other sane. We are in a haunted shithouse. I guess sanity's never been a high priority around this place. Kinda why I've always loved it here. Me, too. Hey, Billy. Yeah, Cassie? Gordon said it had been a long time since he killed anyone. Do you have any idea what he meant by that? Good old Gordo. He was a tank gunner in Iraq. Mowed down a lot of people. Messed with his mind. I guess he couldn't handle all the killing, got an early discharge. Lost himself for a while, ended up here. I don't know what the air is like out there, but as long as we have sunshine and rain, we can survive a long time. You sure about this? It's time. There may be radiation but the dust has settled, so fallout won't blow in. We're past that now. Explain it to me again. How do we keep the air safe in here? That room is built to be an airlock. The door got knocked down a couple years ago. So what do we do, then? Cover it with the emergency blankets, tape up the seams. Should do the trick. But what about you? When I get back, I'll wash down the suit, check my levels, when I'm clear, I'll come back in. And if you get exposed to radiation, are we just supposed to let you die? Radiation poisoning doesn't work that way. Co2 will kill ya quicker, but if I do, we have potassium iodine, helps to counteract radiation poisoning. All done. Seams are nice and covered? Sealed and tight. We're good in here. Now, get your ass out there and get back as fast as you can. Yes, ma'am. How's it looking? As good as it can, I guess. He's wheeling Ida out into the forest now. You see anything? You mean other people? A person, a bird, a bug, shit, anything. No. It's quiet. Just some wind. He's gone now. Outta sight. What did he say about the air toxidity? You mean toxicity? Yes, I do. There's enough Co2 out there to kill you within the hour. What happened to you, Gordon? Oh, wait. You know what? No, I shouldn't, it's none of my business. No, no, it's okay. No, but I'm prying and I just, I shouldn't. Fine. It was my rock bottom. I was an addict. Meth. And heroin. Stole from everybody I knew. Wrecked a car. I didn't kill anyone, but I hurt a lady pretty bad. I was going to jail for six months and I couldn't get clean. So I locked myself in the garage, started the car. Oh, man. But someone obviously saved you. I mean, you're here. Dumb luck. Car ran out of gas. There was nobody left to save me. Even after I got out of county, everyone had disassociated with me. My parents had stopped taking my calls long ago. And my sister, she made it clear I was to stay away. I was lost. I got a job working here six years ago. And the people in this place have been my family ever since. Billy invited me here to the end of the world, to help me. My parents, they didn't even call to say goodbye. This is my family. It's a good family. It has been. What about radiology? You mean radiation? Yes, I do. You would be bleeding out of your ass in ten minutes and dead within the hour out there. Really? Yeah, really. Mmm, that's not good, is it? No, it's pretty terrible. You would bleed, shit and piss a horrible death. Let's not do that. Hey there. This is Billy in the shithouse. All clear now. How did everything go? As well as it could. I'm tired, though. Any radiation exposure? I don't think so. But if my hair starts falling out, we'll know otherwise. How do we know if I got exposure? Die, I guess. Maybe you should take some of these iodine tablets just to be safe. I thought about that, but, I'd rather save those when we need them. The radiation is so high, I'd be dyin' right now if I was exposed. I'm fine. Really. Let's make dinner. We're gonna be safe here. We're good. The air is clean. It's fresh. Well. The power's still on. It's been seven months. Why is this place still operational? It's a giant bomb shelter, man. It's built to last two years. Self-sustaining. Why did you leave, then? Everyone was scared. The meteor was supposed to destroy everything. Scorched earth, man. Besides, we all wanted to be with our families. What about the prisoners? We locked the doors and we left. You left all the prisoners here to die? Just the high risk ones. Oh. The worst ones? I guess. Are they dead? They have to be. Wasn't more than two weeks worth of food. So, what do you think? Was I right? I don't know. Maybe. I guess this place is better than the hospital. Yeah, clean air, man. I haven't seen any bodies yet. They're down in the holding cells. Let's go take a look. We're gonna have to clean up all these bodies before we can live here. Yeah. I guess we can cart 'em down to the yard a few at a time, and burn 'em. I am so tired of burning bodies. Me, too, but it's a hell of a lot better than burying 'em. Yeah, I suppose you're right. Looks like things got bloody. Maybe they escaped. Nah, that's not possible. Look, a guard could have let 'em go. I suppose so, but nah. Let's keep looking. What's this? Solitary confinement. Looks like they've been dragging the dead in here. That's not a bad idea. Keepin' the bodies from rottin' and stinkin' the place up. Human bodies don't decompose this way. Oh, they've been all cut up. Dave, we have a problem here, man. This blood, it's not dry. It's fresh! Well, look at what we got here. Oh, shit. That's right, Mr. Jailer. It's good to see you. We gave you a chance. You gave us hell. Who is this? The worst of the worst, that's who we are. Stay put, Mr. Jailer man, right there on your hands and knees. Hey, we're, we're not here to hurt anybody, okay? We're just lookin' around. Lookin' for the dead, right? Well, we ain't dead, not yet. Y'all stayin' at the hospital? That's what they been talkin' about. Oxygen tanks and food. How many folks you got there at the hospital? 35, 40. What is your name? Raymond. Well, Ruh Ray. I don't believe Mr. Prison man here. Kill him dead, boys. How do you like that,? Huh, how do you like that? How many's really in the hospital? 12. Weapons? Just a few guns. Now, see? That was easy, wasn't it? I like you Ruh Ray. I'm gonna let you live. Thank you. Git. Get on in there. I don't wanna go in there. It's not exactly a choice, Ruh Ray. You go in there, or you die out here. You'll be all right in there for a while. There's plenty of water. And plenty to eat. You'll be fine, Ruh Ray. Yum yum! Let's get the others. Freedom, boys. Asshole! Christ, you scared the shit outta me! Oh, I scared you. You're the one sulking around like a deranged clown. Gotta pass the time somehow. How bored are we today, Gordon? You seen Billy? He was listening on the radio last time I saw him. Thanks. I'm going to the boiler room. Why? Why not? So, what's the report for today? Nothing new from our government. Same message we've had since June. This is Justice Outlaw. Calling out to the Haunted Forest. Anyone home, over? Howdy there, Outlaw. Hey, let's talk in private. Go to that secondary channel. Copy that. Raiders and scavengers just passed us by. And I think they're headin' towards you. That's too bad. We're not all that well hidden. Tell me what I need to know. Two different groups. They're geared up, armed and dangerous. ETA could be any time. Thanks for the heads up. You know what? I could suit up and be over there in an hour. Steer clear. Watch over those kids of yours. We'll be fine. I'll keep this channel open if you need a hand, okay? Over. Copy that, over and out. What do we do? I'll suit up, head out and cut them off. That could be dangerous. Why don't we just wait for them to come in here and then we'll just, like, scare the fuckin' shit out of them? That might not be a bad idea. Get Gordo down here. Okay. I'll go out the shithouse exit, try to get them into the forest. And what's Plan B? What if it looks like they're comin' in? Then let 'em in. Unlock the main door. No need having some asshole break it down if they're coming in anyway. That is not a good plan, Billy. No, not at all. That's not the plan. Just like you said, Cassie. We'll scare the shit out of them. That shouldn't be a problem. Are we supposed to kill anyone? I don't know. If they're just scavengers lookin' to loot, then we just guide them through the haunt. If they're not scavengers? Then they're probably lookin' to take what's ours. This is our home. We defend it. You two comfortable with that? I guess I'm dressed for the occasion. That you are, bud. Door's open. If I can't lead 'em away, I'll lead 'em in. Hey, survivor, we're friends. Let's talk. Keep walking, then, friend. We're looking for food and a place to rest. Maybe refresh our tanks. Those boys look sick. They've been exposed. We're friends. Ain't you a friend? You need to start walking. We just wanna talk. I know this place. I been listening to your radio chitter chatter. Do you have any food? We'd be appreciative. Clean water, place to sleep. We're friends, we can help one another. You keep tellin' me we're friends, but I don't know anything about you. Of course, ask anything, mister... You got a name, Mr. Chitter Chatter? That works for now. How'd you know to come to this place? All that radio talk. All those survivors. Talkin', talk, talk, talkin'. The Outlaw, talkin' away with you, Mr. Chitter Chatter. Mind tossin' your gun on the ground while we talk? See? Nobody's hurtin' anyone. Where you headed to? Somewhere that'll have us. Maybe here? There is no here. You need to move on. We need rest. We need water. We were lookin' for the other radio man, but he wouldn't let us in, neither. That's because they're sick. Mr. Chitter Chatter, these two'll be gone in the next couple of days, but I need a place to live, place to stay. I can help you. You a scavenger? Of course. Nobody'll let ya in, how else do you survive? Where'd you guys really come from? Prison, we came from the prison. You're prisoners? Criminals. Just survivors, now. Like you, chitter chatter. How'd you survive the blast, the fallout? There. Prison had a shelter, too. Fallout shelter, all ready to go. Guards put a bunch of us in there and they left, locked us in. Said it was our best chance to stay alive. It was. For a while, we survived. What did you do? We did what we had to do. We decided to, well, you know. Cannibalism. There was no other choice. There's always a choice. That's what we thought at first, too. But when you're hungry, starvin', tryin' to stay alive, you'll eat just about anything to survive. What happened? First one was killed in his sleep, ripped apart and eaten raw by a rabid group of killers. Then nobody wanted to sleep. We all just wanted to eat. Everybody started killin' everybody. After a day or so, there was only a few of us left. What'd you do? We started eatin', that's what we did. Filled our freezers, too. That meat kept us alive. Then a week ago, scavengers unlocked the place, let us out. I'm thinkin' we shoulda stayed. Clean water and plenty to eat. That why you came here? No, 'course not. I mean, we are lookin' for food, not you. I mean, not if you have food. You do, don't ya? I think it's time you moved on. Just take us in, Mr. Chitter Chatter. You won't even know we're there. I'm not gonna be able to do that. Three of us, one of you. Whoo, take him, wow. Plan B, Plan B. Any eyes on him? Came through this way. Over that way. There's only three here, I think. take this place. There's six inside. They're bad news. Don't let 'em leave. Copy that, boss. Takin' care of business. It's dyin' time. You two ready for a little music? Make it loud. As loud as you can. Pump it. How 'bout some music, bitches. Look for a light. What? Turn these off and find a light. - I - can't see a thing. Keep going. Shoot anything. This place is worse than prison. Shit, this place is worse than hell. All right, I don't think I can do this. It's easy, just look straight ahead. I did it! Damn you, keep it together! Hold your shit, man! What are you doing? Put this back on. No, no, no, it's safe here. We can breathe the air. Mr. Chitter Chatter. I like this place. Come on, let's go. Oh, shit! Shit! Welcome, gentlemen. Today is October 1st and we are officially open for business. Oh, I like this place, Mr. Chitter Chatter. I want to stay here. Why can't we be friends? This is as friendly as it gets. So, what now? You watchin' us? Look up, in the rafters. Oh, you're a smart one. So, what now? So, you gonna kill us both? I'll tell you what. One of you can live. Walk right out of here. Talk, talk, talk. Who's it gonna be? Which one's gonna walk out? That's up to you to decide. Somethin' like that? Thank you. Now throw your gun into the darkness. There you go, now what? Now, you run. Run? Run where? I don't know where the hell I am. Doesn't matter. I'd fly. Okay, okay. You got me. Here I am. Where to go. Just... I don't wanna die in here. I guess you guys were ready for armageddon. You were already livin' in hell. This music. Just kill me now. Haunted Forest, you copy? Copy, Outlaw. We're still here. Did those raiders end up comin' to you? Yeah, they did. How'd things shake out? Hard, real hard. And your crew? Everybody healthy? We're fine. Can't say the same for those scavengers, though. I figured as much. You know what, buddy? This is the other side of armageddon. Copy that, over and out. That's what we had to do, right, Billy? Absolutely. We had to do it. We had to kill them. Those men came here to kill us, to take what's ours. We can't let that happen. Not now, not ever. Thank you for this, Billy. I love you guys. We're a family. And this, is our home.
