I never imagined you would come. How did you manage? - Don't ask. I made an excuse that it's a college educational tour. Yet, dad was reluctant. But somehow I managed to convince him. Trust me. It's a really nice place. Really? - Yeah. Wow! It's beautiful. Now do you see" ..why I was saying no for Lonavla and Khandala? Whose property is this? Nikhil. - Who? Saby's friend Nikhil. It's his uncle's property. They come here sometimes on a holiday. The entire property? No. Only up till here. The property on the other side of the fence.. "belongs to someone else. Some Casablanca. By the way not a bad choice. Sometimes dad's expectations scare me. You know. He was the best footballer of his time. He was the striker for Churchill Club. But.. When his dad passed away" The family responsibility. He had to leave everything. ...and take up a job in a bank. But you should see the glow on his face" ..when he sees me play. Do you know, I can do anything for papa. I just want to see him happy. I owe him that much. If he hadn't adopted me.. I don't know where I would be. Can I ask you something? Just promise me you won't say no. What? Will you please swim with me in that lake? I can't believe I lied at home, put up a scene" ..to come with a duffer like you. I am done. I'm super tired. Come on. Don't be a spoil-span. I'll see you inside, okay. Come on. Come back. Come fast. You will miss me. Let us pray. Lord Jesus Christ. The three days you laid in the tomb. You made holy the graves of all those who believed in you. And even though their bodies lay in the earth.. ..they trust that they, like you will rise again. Given our sister Pearl rests in this grave. Until that you, the resurrection and the life.. "Will raise her up in glory. There she may be in the light of your presence, Lord Jesus. And the kingdom where you live forever and ever. Amen. Since Almighty God called our sister Pearl.. ..from this life to himself. We commit her body to the earth from which it was made. Christ was the first to rise from the dead. And we know that He will raise up our mortal bodies" ..to be like his in glory. We commend our sister Pearl to the Lord. May the Lord receive her into His peace" ..and raise up her body from the last day. Wouldn't this Christmas tree look better.. ..if we put up lights? Yes, Prakash. - Hi, John. How’s it going? Good.

Restrict yourself to lentil and rice, Wagle. 'Biryani' doesn't suit you. Situated in Mumbai city's Chembur area.. ..Royal Citizen Cooperative Bank was robbed last night. No one knows how and when the robbery was committed. According to sources, when the security personnel's.. ..opened the bank in the morning.. "they found the bank manager.. ..and the guard injured. The police are conducting their investigation. "but they haven't found a clue yet. It's clear that, the hoodlums in the city.. ..managed to give the police and the administration the slip. We discussed this matter.. ..with the Joint Commissioner of Police" "Semen Mishra and he said" Careful. Please, sir. You cannot come inside. This is the ICU. - l.. I'm her husband. -I understand.

Do you have any clue what's going on? No. What's going on? You don't know because" ..like always you're drunk. How many times do I have to tell you? B***ch! Don't you get it? I got a call from the bank this morning. They were saying something about a bank-robbery. I don't remember clearly. I was way too drunk. I wasn't in my senses. Sorry. If you want to live, stop drinking. What's the point of staying alive? To be scared every moment" "that one day you will leave me, like everyone else. You will leave me, Gautam, right? No. You're lying. You're lying. Do you love me? Don't start your crap" Say you love me. You love me, don't you? J ust say it.. B***ch! Why did I save you from the drug scam? I should've let you rot in jail. You still haven't answered my question. Now listen to me clearly. You have to go to the bank day-after-tomorrow". ..and claim your belongings. You know... how important. "the Casablanca documents are for us. Stay in your senses. And get that treated. All the phones and surveillance cameras" ..were already destroyed, sir. It was a good planning. But I think they're novices. They didn't touch some of the lockers. They were in a hurry, Scoundrels. The bank manager doesn't know much, sir. They tried to kill his wife.. "so that they can't give a description. Poor thing. They made his life a mess. He's already living an unfortunate life. Do you have any special interest" ..in the bank robbery case, sir? Nothing special. When this bank was being built.. ..my mom worked here as a labourer. Labourer... You sir... Let it be, sir. I get it. Sir...will I take bribe from you? Whores never work for free. Keep it. My father used to say, "Money's a dirty thing". So, every time I touch money, I wash my hands. 'Here. Have juice.' 'She's not going on that tour. That's it.' 'She's 19. She's grown-up.' 'She's not a child anymore.' 'Stop this. . . possessive ness. ' 'Let her life her own way.' 'Come on, don't be selfish. Come on.. - I..' 'Don't. You go cheer her up.' 'Pearl. You can go on your tour or anywhere you want.' 'Dad, thank you, thank you.' 'Thank you, daddy. I love you so much.' Sir. Here's the address to Mahalaxmi Corporation. And the residence address" "of its owner Mr. Framed Pathak. By the way, sir, there hasn't been any transaction. ..in their account for the past one year. We tried contacting them, but no response. You're aware, sir, that people often" ..do this for saving income tax. Sir, I think this company has closed down. He didn't pay his rent for six months. Wonder where he disappeared to? In the end, I rented out his room to someone else. And...his family? - What family? He only had a wife. But she left him because of his habit of drinking. Yes. He does have a drinking buddy. Krishnan. Maybe he can tell you something. Where can I find him? He's always at Metro Bar. Krishnan. When Krishnan comes here, give this to him. Ask him to call on this number. Who are you, sir? I'm his friend. Old friend. Who...Krishnan? Who are you? My name's Michael. You've to think twice before giving your name. Go on. What do you want from me? I went to see Pramod Pathak this morning. But he doesn't stay there any longer. His landlord told me.. ..only you can tell me about his whereabouts. What do you want from him? I want to make a real-estate deal. There are others in the queue. They are looking for him. Do you have 25,000? I'll take you to him. 25,000! Okay. One minute. 25,000 for his whereabouts" ..and 25,000 for not telling your name. Do you accept? Then come see me tomorrow. "at Vashi subway with 50,000, at 4 o'clock. Michael? Krishnan? - Yes. Did you get the money? - Yes. Feels strange. A deal between two strangers is always strange. Yes. Give it. ls it all here? Where is Framed Pathak? He died three months ago. Why ask me for money? Are you concerned about Pramod Pathak" ..or Mahalaxmi Corporation? How do you know about Mahalaxmi Corporation? The only interesting thing in Pramod's useless life.. "was Mahalaxmi Corporation. What do you know about Mahalaxmi Corporation? It was a bogus...company. - Bogus? Think about it. A drunk peon Pramod turns owner of.. ..a company worth 80 million. Wouldn't you call that bogus? What? I didn't get it. It's simple. Someone else was behind the dastardly acts.. ..and used Mahalaxmi as front. And who was the scapegoat? Framed. The company closed overnight. Shutdown. Who did the income-tax and police came after? One night he suddenly called me. He said, "My life's in danger." I said, "What can I do." He said, "l want money." "Lend me some money, and I'll leave this city forever." I said, "Okay." I called him at Metro. Metro Bar. I waited. But he didn't come. Why? Why? He was run-over by a truck. Who are behind Mahalaxmi Corporation? I don't know, neither did Pramod. But I can tell you that, they are dangerous people. Don't get yourself into this. You see if they get a whiff.. "that you're inquiring about their company" ..you will be run-over by a truck too. I told you, all I knew. You paid me money, I don't want anything bad for you. I'm leaving. We won't meet again, Michael. I value my life, buddy. You know what. You're an animal. The most dangerous animal in the world are humans. And I love this animal. - Me too. I mean the animal inside me. My mom called up today. What was she saying? She was asking when am I getting married, having a child. So what did you say? I said I'll ask you. What should I say? I share a strange relationship with this world. We both hate each other equally. I don't know who my parents are. I only knew... Father Mathews from the orphanage. I was 9 years old.. ..when he called me to his room. He said" "Don't worry my child." "It will not hurt." I was small" ..weak, couldn't do anything. weakness is the worst disease in this world. After joining the police force, I went to see the priest. But he was dead. I didn't get the answers to my questions. How can I answer yours? And I don't want to give anything to this world. Love. Forgiveness or a child. Yes. Gautam sir, Moosa was just here. He was inquiring about your business dealings.. ..with Anees Pathan. I didn't tell him anything. But I sense somethings wrong. What's wrong? Somethings wrong. Somethings wrong. Surely God is good to the upright. To those who are pure in heart. But as for me, my feet almost stumbled. I nearly lost my foothold. For I was envious of the arrogant" ..when I saw them prosper in their wickedness. For they suffer no pain and they're strong" ..in sound of body. Free from troubles common to mortals. They are not stricken by human ills. That is why pride becomes their necklace.. ..and violence the robe that covers them. Malice flows out from their pampered fatness. Evil oozes from their corrupt minds. They scoff and speak with malice. And in their arrogance they threaten oppression. They mouths claim heaven for themselves" ...and their tongues take control of the earth. People therefore look up to them.. ..and lap up every word they utter. How will God ever find out, they say. ls everything known to the most High? Such are the wicked, always carefree.. ..while they rake in riches. In vain, I've kept my heart clean" ..and washed my hands in innocence. Good to see you, sir. I thought we'll never meet again. Drink? - No, thanks. I know you don't like me too much. But if you share a drink with me.. ..l'll feel that you've forgiven me. No, really. Thank you. So, what brought you here? Mr. Ghosh, actually. -Yes. Go on. Maybe I shouldn't have come here, I am sorry. I guess I disturbed you. I'll leave. - Mr. John. Mr. Ghosh. I accept your proposal. But I want something in return. Beautiful car. How much for this car, Moosa? Rascal. Scoundrel. Untie me. Do you ever dream Moosa? Did you ever see a dream.. ..where you're running and suddenly. ..you cannot run anymore. Gautam, this isn't right. - I see. But don't worry, Moosa. You won't see this dream again. Because once I choose my target" "then he can never dream again. You will have to pay for betraying Khan sir. Rascal! Even dogs stay loyal all their life. But remember this betrayal" Your blood's overflowing with loyalty. Fool. A dog's always a dog, no matter how loyal he is. He never becomes the master. Hello, Gautam sir. Anees Pathan. From Dubai. Get to the point. That's exactly what I like about you. The deal with AG Group is final. And the money's ready. Just handover the Casablanca documents. Then Khan will be in my clutches" ..and Al Hunain will belong to AG Group. And you will have Rs. 40 million. NO, 50. 50? The deal was for 40. I am making the deal, not you. 50. Deal done. What do you think? Will the documents be at the bank? I've done your job. I hope you will do mine too. Goodnight. John. You're forgetting the important thing. Count it. - No. It's one million. Thank you. - And...don't worry. This will stay between us. Just get my job done. - It will be done. Thank you. You can go. Next. Tabassum Habi bi. Account no? - 1114357070. Locker no? - 216. What was in your locker? Just some documents. Property related. They were kept in a file. What was the colour of the file? Was anything written on it? Brown colour file. Casablanca. Okay. Please go into the reclaim room and collect it. Ma'am, please sit here. I'll just check. Check your belongings. What? Do you have a problem? Shinde. I want the Royal Citizen Bank robbers. Yes, sir. And, listen. You have to do this unofficially. You will get your price. Just wait and see...Shinde's talent. Gautam. We should get out of this city as soon as we can. Maybe, out of the country. Let's leave. Let's go to Dubai, Singapore.. Let's run away before Khan sir finds out. We can live comfortably with the money that we have. How long can we run? Understand this. The file's intact, only the papers are missing. Someone wants to implicate me. But who is this new enemy, I want to find out. Just remember one thing. I can't see you die. Yes, Shafiq. Khan sir's calling you, Gautam. He wants to talk to you. Come home quickly. I'm coming. You think Khan sir has come to know about it? Hello. Don't you hear the chants? You'll have to wait 10 minutes. Why do you commit suicide like this every Friday? It's not suicide or torture, I just embrace death. I embrace the pains of life. Pain and life have a deep relation. And no one can escape this pain. It is we who choose pain, Khan sir. Gautam, remember the day" ..when you came to me seeking help? As a suspended officer. It's been years since that day. But you're just as arrogant. Since that day I've had a wish. I want to see you shatter. I want to see you cry, break-down. I want to see tears in your eyes. I want to see a glimpse of humanity in these eyes. Tears make humans weak, Khan sir. Sometimes this tears and pain" "gives us inner strength. Brings us closer to God. I don't believe in God. You don't believe in Him, you've to know Him. I don't want to know anyone other than myself. I am my own Creator. These days you've been seeing Anees a lot. It's business, Khan sir. Anees's father and uncle.. ..were the taint in our business. They were traitors. They couldn't kill me.. Instead, they killed my family. I shed lots of blood. I didn't spare anyone except for women and children. That rascaPs one of them. And now he's been threatening. ..my investors in Dubai. They shouldn't face any problem. They're doing business because they trust me. Its better that Anees understands this. I've sworn not to shed anymore blood. Put some sense into him. I'll try, Khan sir. My father used to say" ..if you want to burden someone" ..then entrust him with all your faith. I want to see the Casablanca estates property documents. Bring an application in writing. Get it signed by the authorities. Then you'll get it. That's the procedure. It will take two weeks. - Two weeks. Maybe...“ can take four. Suresh. I ordered tea.

You're working on bribe, not salary. Come on. Come in and sleep. But I like it here. Don't take my baby away. Come on. You left my child back there. - It's okay. Gautam, is it that difficult to have a family? It's quite late, get some sleep. My mother had a dream to have a family. But her dream was never fulfilled. It remained a dream. She died. But she passed on her dream to me. And now, my dreams will never be fulfilled too. Never. Hello, Gautam sir. I told you not to come here. What to do, Gautam sir? I had to.

Uncle.. - Enough. Don't say anything. I hate you, you know that. Because she lied to me because of you. And see what happened. And I hate you because she loved you more than me. Sometimes I feel I didn't know her. You didn't know her, uncle. You think I've no regrets about her death. She meant everything to me. And music... meant everything to her.. ..not your bloody football. She played for your happiness. Because she wanted to fulfill your dreams" .. instead of hers. And that's the truth, uncle. I was selfish. I didn't realise that she was doing all this.. "because she felt that she owed me. Now it's my time. Now it's my time. Everyone has to pay. I'll make sure everybody pays for this. Liyaqat. Liyaqat. Shinde sir. Wow! Great. For the first time I realised" "that silence is a beautiful thing. What's wrong, Shinde sir? All the way here. What brings you here? - I had to.

There was a prayer meeting at my friend's place. Christmas season. So late? - Had to go. Sir. There's nothing in the car. Except for this Bible. Sir, we've been waiting here for so long. I wonder what they must be doing with the money. Why did you join the police force, Shinde? It's a funny story. In my childhood, I saw Bachchan's 'Zanzeer'. I really liked it. That's when I decided I'll be an honest police officer. I never realised when I turned corrupt. And when I did.. ..l thought this is best. Life's really strange, sir. A three-hour movie changed my life. Sir, if you don't mind can I ask why did you join? My story's somewhat similar. The only difference is.. ..it took three hours to change your life. And three minutes to change mine. It's a pretty bad situation, Prakash. I should explain to you from the beginning. 25 kilometres away from Lonavla, about five years ago. There was about 8000 acres of forest land.. ..which the government reclassified" ..and classified it as agricultural land. Now as soon as this happened.. ..a Dubai based real estate firm called Al Hunain.. ..with the help of Sikander Hayat Khan and.. ..ACP Gautam produced 70 fake farmers. They took their signatures" ..and took possession of 6000 acres. And renamed it Casablanca. This thing was a bloody scam, Prakash. There were no such farmers. They only existed on papers. But this bloody thing gets even worse, Prakash. Two years ago that place caught fire. They called it a fire-accident" ..and the case was closed.
