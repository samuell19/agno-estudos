Three and a half hours in that car! We could've left earlier. Now it's almost 9:00! Will you stop complaining? Jeez. What a great trip! This way over here. Bright and early. Ready to go to work tomorrow. And why doesn't that sound appealing to me? Hey, man, did you really put a down payment on this thing? Just to fix it up. Besides, he practically gave it away. Yeah, maybe there's a reason for that. I don't think it looks that bad. Yeah, I love old houses. They make me feel like I'm in another time. Everybody, I think it's a smart move. Hey, Steve thinks it's a smart move! Well, if you think it's a smart move, Steve, then we all know it's definitely a bad move. Are you guys going to start already? Just replace some boards and some windows, And we'll give it a nice paint job, and it'll look great. Oh, it's that easy, huh? Hey, Mark, I think you made a good choice. Place looks like it has a lot of potential. Well, come on. Let's take a look around. Hey, Mark, you could put a vegetable garden over here. No, no. He doesn't want to spend any more money than he has to. How much could a stupid vegetable garden be? You want vegetables, honey? You've got it. Hey, yo. Come here, you guys. Check this out. What is it? I don't know. An old tombstone. There's no date on it. JAMIE: That's creepy. What's it's say? Abigail Leatherby. Surviving is one daughter Ann. May her soul be placed in peaceful hands. Well, let's clear the garbage out now. [Smash] What the hell'd you do that for? Yeah, you idiot. You should have just left it alone. Bob, if it bothered you so much, We could have just covered it up with something. Hey, what's the big deal anyway? It was just a stupid old rock. You should have some respect. You really shouldn't have touched it. Sometimes you are such a creep, Bob. Maybe you woke her up, man. (LAUGHING) Yeah, right. Hey, guys. Look at this. What is it? It looks like a noose. Hmm. It's up there pretty good. Looks a little used. Hey. It's all ready to use. Any volunteers? I volunteer you. What's the matter, man? No quick comeback? Shut up, man. Hey! Now, where do you suppose it came from? Eh, it's probably just some kids messing around. Yeah, most likely he's right. Maybe not. Yeah? Where else would it have come from? You never know. Yeah, right. I'd hate to die by hanging. OK, let's cut it down, all right? Guys, let's do it later. It's getting late. Let's get started on the house. I wonder what the inside looks like. If it looks anything like the outside, It's going to take years to fix up. Well, I think I need my first beer. JAMIE: We haven't even started working yet! Hey, I got to have one, all right? You want to open up the cooler? Well, we didn't bring any beer anyway. I'm sorry. I guess I should have bought some. You're putting me on! You've got to have beer. They're not putting you on. They didn't bring any. Hey, don't you know that a carpenter's tools are His hammer, nails, and beer? Here, Joey. Go to the place we passed a few miles back And get a case, all right? Hey, yo. Big time. This isn't enough. Why don't you just give it up for one day? I have to have it to work, all right? [Struggling to open door] Here, man. Let me try. Let me try. It'll go. It'll go. You mind if I try? Don't worry, I got it. I think you might break it. Why don't you just give me the key? Let the pro do it? OK. Let's see. These old doors always stick. LINDA: That used to happen with our door downstairs All the time. Maybe it's trying to tell you people something. No, you just have to treat it gently. What a dump! This place is a mess! What? It's not that bad. Besides, the lady said somebody bought it a while back And started fixing up, so we're halfway there. What happened to him? She didn't say. He just left. Eh, it really looks a lot worse than it is. You've just got to take it room by room. Before you know it, it'll look great. That's a nice rug. I wonder if it's an antique? Mark, this place is going to cost a fortune! Hey, I never said it was in the best condition. Forget about it. I can tell you right now this place is shot. Oh, real optimistic attitude. Do you have to smoke? I always smoke a cigarette before a big job. It's a ritual with me. [Whistling] So where do we start? [Whistling] Hey, knock it off. [Whistling] Hey, you want to knock it off? Me? Yes, Steve. The whistling? Yeah, the whistling. It's only whistling. It's bothering me. How can that whistling be bothering you? Because it's annoying, and I don't like it. So cut it out! Hey, can you get the other two sawhorses Out of the truck for me? Yeah, sure. No problem. Steve? Jenny? You want to give me a hand? You know, Mark, there should be a cheaper way To make this house look good. Yeah, I've got some great ideas. Man, you shouldn't make such a big deal out of nothing. The guy was only whistling. Do we have to keep talking about it? I just didn't feel like hearing it. I'm sure there have been times when Somebody whistling a stupid song would annoy you too. Not yet, no. Yeah, well, let's not talk about and get started. All right? Come on, dammit. Could I see that? Thanks. You're welcome. Hey, Bob? Where's the plug for this? It doesn't need a plug. It runs on batteries. If it needed a plug, it wouldn't work. I doubt this house has any power at all. Yes, it does. The light is on over there. Well, maybe it does. Do you know how to use that thing? Not really. Here, let me show you. Thanks. MARK: Hey, Bob? Where do you want these? BOB: Eh, you can just set those over there. Place looks better already, huh? Yeah, I really start to work when I get my beer. These things are heavier than they look. Hey, man. I thought you told me this place doesn't have electric. That's right. It doesn't. Well, tell that to the light over there. Hmm. Some wires must have moved around or something. We've got an electrician coming tomorrow. He'll take care of the whole thing. It's my brother. He works very fast. He's going to rewire the whole place. I hope he does a good job. There's a lot of idiot electricians Running around out there. No, he's one of the best. (SARCASTICALLY) Fantastic. What the hell happened? Did anybody see what happened? No. We were just standing here. Great. Just great. How'd she get in here? She probably busted a lock on the back door. Can we help you? Hey, if she doesn't stop staring at us, I'm going to go over there and smack her! Excuse me, ma'am. I don't know you are or how you got in here, But I'm afraid you're going to have to leave. She is creepy-looking. Why doesn't she speak? Aw, she probably can't hear us too well. Hey, lady! You're not supposed to be in here! You have to get out! You understand? See? Simple as that. I'm going to make sure she leaves. Hey, do you want me to go with you? No, no. You stay here. I'll be back in a second. I don't believe this. Here, let me give you a hand picking them up. No, just leave them. We'll get them in a couple minutes. I need some fresh air in here. [Struggling with lock] It figures. I'll get it. Oh, you can do it better? You just have to put pressure on the door while you turn. (SARCASTICALLY) It's working great. I guess I must just be a real idiot. It's really stuck. Yeah, there must be another door. What's going on? Well, Bob and I are going to check for another door. Bob needs his fresh air. You got a problem with that? [Struggling with lock] Mark? MARK: What? Did you find her? MARK: Not yet. Let me try. Another pro! Oh, give yourself a break, Bob. [Pounding] Oh, that's what I forgot to do... Bang my fist against the door! Shut. Up. Come on! It can't be this stuck! Mind if I try? Sometimes if you're real gentle, it'll go. Oh, and that will work? I can try. Sure. Go ahead. Thanks. Mark! MARK: What? The back door is stuck. I'll be there in a second. JAMIE: Well, did you find the old lady yet? No. Well, just forget it. She's probably gone already anyway. Well, sorry. I tried. A valiant effort. Hey, wait a minute. You know how to open it? Yeah, you try. You've got the magic fingers. Sure, I'll give it a shot. He'll get it. He's got a perfect record today [Click] Hey, it clicked. Open it. Come on, it clicked. Even with the magic fingers can't get it. Well, I guess you can't get every one. Mark? MARK: What now? Will you come down here? We can't get this door open! MARK: I'll be right down! Just forget about the lady and come on! Mark! Mark? On top of all this he has to start With this stupid little jokes. I'll get this damn door open. How? BOB: Tool box. Mark? Mark! Stop fooling around! (FRIGHTENED) Mark? [Breathing heavily] Mark? [Struggling with door] (TERRIFIED) Mark! Please! Answer me! You're making me nervous. [Gasp] OLD LADY: I know about your boyfriend. What about my boyfriend? He's dead! What do you mean? I should know. I killed him! Ha. Ha. It was quite gruesome, actually. He was kicking and screaming for such a long time. But now it's over. I don't believe you. Where do you think all that blood came from? It's your boyfriend's blood! [Giggles] What are you going to do now? Kill me? Hmm. You know, I could kill you with this! Now move! [Door slams] [Panting] MARK: Hello, darling. [Gasp] [Coughing] Where you been? Oh my God. What happened to you? What are you doing? Mark! That's right! It's me! I've been looking all over for you. Better call the police and have her arrested. Now answer my question. What are you doing? I'm leaving! Leaving? What do you mean, you're leaving? I'm leaving! I'm getting (QUIETLY) out of this place. What makes you think you can just leave? [Coughing] Where are you going, huh? Are you going to the mall? Huh, Jamie? Going to do a little shopping? That's good. We need... we need knick-knacks. Lots of knick-knacks. Maybe some... some doilies, even! That would be nice. You always were good at spending someone Else's money, weren't you? Having no responsibility at all! What about my responsibilities? Huh? Dearest? Snookums? But I guess you just don't understand, do you? - Yes, I do understand. - No, you don't! That's the point! You don't understand! [Chuckling] I often wondered what goes on inside your head. And now I'm going to find out. I'm going to take that piece of wood And bash your skull in, and really have a look-see! Please, Mark! I just want to leave! So leave me alone! No one is leaving here till we get done fixing it! That means me, you, and everyone else downstairs! Do you understand? [Drilling] What happened? What's it look like? Nothing! That drill did not work? It's like drilling into lead. It's impossible. Well, what about a bigger drill? This is the biggest drill I got. If this isn't going to work, nothing will. I think it's time to forget about the door. Hey, you can forget about the door. I'm not going to be beat by some stupid door that's stuck. I'm going to do what we should have done a long time ago... I'm Going to axe that bitch down. [Suspenseful music] Oh, that was good. You almost got me that time. I'm telling you for the last time... I'm leaving. Leaving? Leave this? Why would you ever want to leave a beautiful setup like this For? Give me the wood. No. OK then, let's talk. Talk? I don't think so. I think you should give me the wood. We can sit down and talk about it. Come on... we'll have a nice friendly little chat. If you're not going to give it to me, I'm just going to have to take it from you. Well, come on. Take it then. Oh, feisty, huh? Come on... give me the wood! [Moaning] [Crying] Where's my damn axe? Look, I'm going to stay in here and wait for Mark. Fine. Listen, why don't we just open a window? Yes, a window it is. Is it gonna open? It's just a lock. Yeah. This window is stuck, too. What? Hold on, this is going to be a lot easier than the door. [Ominous music playing] Come on, god dammit! Hold on. You hear that noise? Yeah, it sounds like it's coming from outside. [Dark music playing] Push! Upstairs. Don't go up there. Jamie. Where's Mark? Where is he? He's dead. What the hell are you talking about? Dead? The old lady that was down here before, she killed him. Where is he? Upstairs. You're full of shit. I saw him. He's dead. The old lady told me that she killed him. I don't know what she did to him, but he tried to get me. Where's the old lady now? I don't know. Jesus. You're the man with all the bright ideas. What do we do now? Joe should be back from getting your beer any minute. When he sees all the shutters are closed and he can't get in, He'll know something's wrong. And he better go for help. [Engine roaring] [Singing to self] [Singing to self] [Knocks on door] Hey, Bobby. Open up, man. It's beer here. Hey, come on, man. Open up. [Knocks again] Linda? Steve? Hey, Ron? It's me, Joey! Come on. Great. Hey, Bobby, I'm gonna drink this beer all myself, man. We'd better play it safe. What are you doing? Nobody's coming near me. If I were you, I'd get something sharp out of this toolbox Or that one over there. See now, she's got a nice club. You better get something good. All right, let's take a look. Now this... this is the sort of thing you need. What kind of a carpenter's tool is that? It's not. I just carry it around in case of emergencies. Have you ever used it? No, I haven't had the opportunity. It's beautiful, though, isn't it? Yeah. Let's just hope we don't have to use it. I'd hate to be on the receiving end of that. Man, you're never going to smash Anybody's skull with this. Now this... this could cause some serious brain damage. [Talking to self] Are you guys in there, or what? OK. OK. I'm going home. Marshmallow fluff on some bread. Hand me that blade over there. This thing? Yes. Ow. Now hand me those screws. Here. Palm this. See how it feels. I don't know. Feels good. Great. Now give me a couple of minutes. When I get done with this, you won't Have anything to be scared of. Oh, jeez. What the hell am I doing here? [Boards clattering] Shit. Bobby? Bobby, come here quick, I mean it! Bobby, I'm serious... Get over here quick! I'm not playing around. Hey, listen, give me a hand, would you? No. Come on, I'm not playing games here. Give me a hand. No. What, are you nuts or something? I'm going to fall. [Cackles maniacally] [Screams] [Screams] Where do we start? We don't have to start. She'll find us. Hey, I'm going first. Want to check the closets, man? OK. I don't think she's in here. Nothing here. We have to check. (RASPY VOICE) Steve. Steve, don't leave me. Linda? Steve, it won't open. Move away, let me try. Let's hit it. Steve, stand back. What's happening? Keep away from the door. Steve. What? Try from your side. Try to break it down. All right, stand back. I'm going again. It's not going to work. Linda? LINDA: Yes? Are you OK? I'm fine. Steve. What? Listen to me. Go ahead. We're not going to get out of this room. You go through this house and you find that old lady. I found her. (IN UNISON) What? She's right here. The old lady is right next to me. Where? Kill her. She's ten feet away from me. Steve, be careful. Is she holding anything in her hand... a knife or anything? No, no. Well, you know what to do, man. Get her. She's leaving. Kill her! Steve, don't go! Don't go near her. Shut up! If he doesn't kill her, we're all going to die. Don't go! Shut up! She's coming back toward me again. When she gets close enough, stick her. LINDA: Make sure she's dead. OLD LADY: Come on. What? OLD LADY: It's your turn. What are you talking about? OLD LADY: It's your turn. Steve! What? Where is she? She's... she's walking away. Well go after her, man, now! She's going toward the stairs. Go, dammit! - I'm going. - Get her! Kill her! Hey, Steve. How's the real world, man? What's the matter? Don't you recognize me? It must be this big pole in my chest. Wait a minute. Now that's a pole. Joey? Yeah, now you got it. Are you dead? Oh, you're quick, Steve. You're real quick. Listen, I gotta get going. No, please, wait. Tell me, how did she get you? Just tell me how to get out of here. You can't, man. It's over. You see, you're next. You won the lottery, Jackson. What? What are you talking about? She's gonna get you, man, and it's going to hurt real bad. Joey, wait, wait. Please, wait a second. You'll see me again real soon. No, wait a second, please. Come back. Joey, wait. OLD LADY: Well, aren't you going to use it? Stay away from me. I don't want to hurt you, but I will if I have to. Look, stop coming toward me. I'm not kidding. Or I'm going to have to use this. I'll use it. Stay away. This is the last time I'm going to tell you... stay back. [Screams] What the hell's wrong with you? You hear that screaming? Oh my god, that's Steve. Shit, that's coming from downstairs. We've gotta get out of here. [Crying] [Cackling] [Screams] [Screams] [Screams] All right, Linda. We'll just keep trying until we get out. Let me try. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. The screams stopped. It clicked. If it opens, open it slow. Steve? [Crying] We'll find her. God, let's hope not. What the hell are you talking about? We're going to find her and kill her. Look at the floor. There are four holes in the floor. She must have had him pinned down. So what the hell does that mean? That means I don't want to meet what did that. You better not be serious. I am serious. Look, our best bet is to avoid that thing, And sooner or later, someone's going to come by here And help us. The only help we're going to get is ourselves. We have to find her and we have to kill her. What makes you think that you can kill her? Is she OK? Yeah. Come on. I got it. Let's go over to the Leatherby house. I don't want to. I heard stories about that place. You think there's ghosts in that house? I believe Mark Stallworth. What did he say? He said that there are ghosts in that house. He saw one. And you believe that bullshit? Stallworth doesn't bullshit. Well, I'm not laying around here all night. I'm going over there. I'm leaving. OK, be careful. If you were a real, true, loyal friend, you'd go. I mean, if you really believe in ghosts And you really are my friend, you wouldn't let me go In that house alone, would you? See you later. Thanks a lot. We'll never get it. See, I told you it ain't gonna work. Hey, maybe we can use this rope. Look at this stuff over here. Are we here to look at a bunch of stupid stuff Or are we trying to get out of here? It's an article. It's about the house. What about the house? Oh my god. What's it say? "The Leatherby house today was once" Again placed on the market. The house, which has been on and off the market For over 18 years, has been placed in the hands of Showbine Realtors and is owned by Franklin Olson, brother of original owner, Abigail Leatherby. Mrs. Leatherby was attacked in her home By a man who entered through an unlocked front door. The man stabbed her 37 times, 12 times in the neck. Miraculously, Mrs. Leatherby lived. She was placed under strict physical and mental therapy At Mount Rainside Hospital. After eight months, she returned home and was Reunited with her daughter. Nine days later she was arrested for the murder Of Carl Hindman, a neighbor who had Visited her to wish her well. She stabbed Mr. Hindman exactly 37 times, 12 times in the neck. Mrs. Leatherby died four days later of a heart attack. Two days after she was buried in Three Oaks Cemetery, Her daughter Ann dug up her grave And buried her in the backyard of their house. "The same night, she hung herself from a tree near the grave." It's what the news was for. And the tombstone. Hey, I found a way in. Come here. You just have to break these chains. I can't believe you. Look, I'll go in alone. Forget it. You can wait out here. All right, you broke it. I knew you wouldn't let me down. Why am I friends with you? I'm a great guy. We'll just try all these rooms. Yeah, and what happens when we see her? We'll just deal with that when the time comes. Steve? (DEEP VOICE) Linda. Steve, is it really you? Of course it is. Come over here, Linda. Steve, come out in the hall. I can't. Why? I'm hurt. The old lady hurt me. Oh no. Are you hurt bad? Yeah, I'm hurt real bad. I can't get up. Oh, god. I'm so glad you're all right. We saw that room with the blood, and I thought... Of course I'm all right. She had somebody else in the room. What happened to you? I just barely got out. She almost had me, but I cut her up pretty good with the knife Bob made me. Where is she now, do you know? Yeah, I know. I know exactly where she is. And I know how to get out of here. How? First, we go to the others. We tell them and then we'll get out of here alive. They're down the hall. I'll get them. You stay here and I'll be right back. No, wait. What is it. You can't go yet. What's the matter. Just hold me one more time. Sure, sure. Thank you. Thank you. You've always been so good to me. You're welcome, Steve. I know, I know we're going to make it. You've always been so kind, so supportive, so nice. [Cackles] What's so funny, Steve? Steve? [Ominous music] Hey, man. It's open. All right, all right, come on. Keep it going, man. Get it out there. All right, all right. Tie the rope up over there, tie it up, man. Come on. Hey, wait a minute. Where's Linda? Linda? Linda? Yes? We're taking her with us. Maybe. Remember Mark. She's not. She is. We have to see. Linda, are you all right? I'm perfectly fine. Why? We found a way out. We're leaving. Oh, good. Let's go. Come on, Linda, now. Actually, I'd rather stay. Bitch! Come on, come on, hit the road, man. Tie up to the door over there. Come on, hurry up. Hurry up, man. All right, all right, this should do it. And when I get down, I want you both to follow Behind me, all right? Don't even wait till I hit the ground... just File behind me, OK? OK. Let's go. Shh. What the hell is the matter? I hear a creaking noise. We've been hearing them all night. Doesn't matter. Let's just move. Oh my god, get him out of the window. [Screams] God, it's so... [screams]. God, I hate this! [Screams] Where are we going? Let's go check out some of these rooms. Hey, do you hear that humming? Yeah, where is it coming from? I think it's coming from this room over here. What do you think you're doing? Nothing. If you want to watch, why don't you just Come in and close the door? Come on, don't be scared. You can come closer. Isn't the view better now? We weren't watching, really. I think you were watching me. Can I ask you a question? Speak. Why are you getting undressed in this room in this house? I always get undressed before I go to bed. Where are you going to bed? It's just the wind. I'm going to bed in this room. What are you two doing here? We just came to look around. I guess you haven't seen my mother yet. Your mother? Yes, she's around here somewhere. I'm surprised you made it all the way to my room. What are you talking about? It usually doesn't take her long to kill people. That's not funny. He's dead. Rick, you're alive. No, I'm dead. Take a look. Stay here, OK? Who are you? [Shrill screaming] What happened? Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. The lady was just in here. I tried to hold her off as long as I could, but she left. She heard you running. Let me help you up. Can you walk OK? Yeah, I think so. Just lead the way. Listen, there's somebody else in here. I don't know who or what he is, but just stay close, OK? Let's just get out of this room. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Just go. Are you sure? Just go. OK. [Breaking noise] No! No, man, stop! Come on. She tried to kill you. She tried to stab you, come on. Look at the scissors. Look at the blood. Come on, I'm telling you the truth. Come on. Is there anybody else here with you? There were six others. I'm the only one left. So I am. You have any idea how to get out of here? We've been trying. [Old lady yells] [Whistling "jimmy crack corn"] Hey. Hey.
