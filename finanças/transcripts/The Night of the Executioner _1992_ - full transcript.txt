You found a jewel A woman like me couldn't be anything else Champagne! Your birthday deserves no less, father It's not a Dom Perignon, but I'll take it Dom Perignon is too much for a provincial quack like Dr Arranz Thanks to sleepless nights from my sainted wife, I've become a celebrated surgeon Half a century old today and never happier That's great dad, well done You're adorable women but maybe pamper me too much Only tonight. Turning 50 is an occasion worth noting But you'll be on a strict diet later 20 years of martyrdom... I mean matrimony - for this Watch your cholesterol, dad And lose weight Adorable women? Monsters is what you are 14,600 sir - Here you are - Thank you - Animal! - Kids these days! - Did you get the shampoo? - Yes You saw him, money out of his ass and two fine sluts Keep watching, find out where they live and let me know Later at the Black Owl Maybe it's our lucky night Agreed Ralph, those babes are too much for that rotten piece of shit We'll have ourselves a super dooper party Congratulations dad, I love you Thank you, I love you too Hugo, you're the best thing that life's given me and I expect to be at your side when you reach 100 Alright you guys, enough mushy stuff, time for a toast Let's see what he thinks Splendid, thank you Irene I should let you know that it's over 100 years old Elementary my dear Watson It suits you, even Sherlock Holmes would be jealous And now from your daughter Mr. Detective, a bit of music Let's see if I can guess: Mozart? Bach? Vivaldi? Michael Jackson? No? Well let's see Leonard Cohen, I like him too Good evening What a tender scene, the mother, father and baby all cuddling Don't move, hold it Move a finger, just a finger and you're history The fucking rich, they always eat like kings Boys, do you know what I'd do to these sons of bitches? What's that Lola? I'd stick these beer cans up their elegant asses What do you want from us? What is it? Not much asshole, just all the cash on you and your sluts' jewelry Alright, we'll give you everything we have, just please don't hurt us Agreed, let's see the goods and we'll leave the beating for another day The jewelry is in the bedroom Spark, Rambo, go with her You stay here What's this? Is this it bitch? I swear to God that's all we have in the house How old are you, slut? I don't understand Over 40 I bet, but you're still hot All you rich broads take care of yourselves, makeup, creams You people use makeup made from new-born babies and wipe it all over your asses That's how your husband loves your hole And so do we, right Spark? Please don't hurt me, please! You'll see what a real man is Our pals are taking their time What do you suppose they're doing? She looked like a slut, probably begged for some action What are you saying bastards, what are you saying? Can't you guess, shit face, or do I need to draw you a picture? I guess after the beating we gave you, your wires got crossed That... that's my wife! What have they done? Listen cocksucker, I'm sick of you. One more word and I'll blow your brains out This is all we found What a shame, at least we're gonna take it out on his flesh Have some amphetamines man - Sons of bitches! - The night's just begun Murderers! Lola, go to the kitchen and make a nice dinner, we're gonna celebrate this fucker's last birthday Murderers! Bastards! Sons of bitches!

Boning this one, fucking her till it aches Don't touch my daughter bastards, don't touch her! Spark, come help me What are you going to do? I don't need no anaesthetics I'll show you I'm a better sawbones than you are Spark, the knife Rambo... Hold him down I'm gonna shut him up for good And now it's time for you to have some fun, precious We're really gonna do a number on that big titted slut Your dad's spitting up blood like a pig, I wouldn't like it if he bled out before the game was over A moment boys, metal music And after raping and killing the mother and daughter, Dr Arranz miraculously survived but he'll never speak again The thugs that attacked him nearly tore out his tongue by the root and though it seems ironic, that was lucky They probably thought he'd bled to death It's horrible, Irene and the poor girl dying like that Elvira, I'm sorry it's me had to give you the bad news but with Olga gone I could only get in touch with you When my boss goes on vacation she often doesn't tell us where to Says that's the only way she can relax and really rest You know her, with age she's become more independent She'll be very troubled when she hears this She liked them You're a good friend too, right? Yes, I knew them since I worked at the buffet on King's Way They were good people and I liked them a lot Forgive me Elvira, but I've noticed you have a certain weakness for Hugo Am I wrong? It's true, and I'm so sorry about this dreadful business Of course, but it seems to me that no one could help him forget, if that were even possible, except you Don't hurt me, please, I beg you I'll come through, I swear I will Tronco, this is just a friendly meeting You'll sort it, will you? I warned you bastard, no one messes with us No, give me another chance, another chance, please! You're such a handsome boy, shame you're chicken Good afternoon gentlemen - Good afternoon - Good afternoon So, our good friend came to the meeting Yes, of course, I... You owe me a lot of money, horse is an expensive habit, and you've run out of credit - Not paying is a shitty thing - I'll pay, I swear I'll pay, I swear I have to set an example so my other clients know I'm not to be trifled with Lola, play one of your jokes on him Come on pal, show me what you got What you got is very small, pal He's shitting himself, he's really fucked up Hugo, can you hear me? It's Elvira You don't know how sorry I am for what happened Whatever you need, I'll sort it Olga is outside, but don't worry, she'll be back soon You can count on her, body and soul You know she cares for you You're very strong, and a born fighter. You'll recover That's enough - He's on sedatives, he should rest - Of course, I understand Tell me, will he be alright? Will he be able to speak? He's a man of extraordinary vitality For a long time, he was nearly dead It's a miracle he's come this far, but he'll recover - At least physically - What do you mean? Psychologically he'll never be the same, the trauma has been far too grave He'll need a lot of help He'll have it, I assure you Doctor, when can I question him? Soon, maybe six or seven days Thank you - He'll recover completely - I expect so Commissioner, four years ago my father and brother were killed They'd gone to cash a check No one has caught the perpetrators yet Yes, I know, but sadly criminals aren't always caught I'm trying not to hate But every time I think of that, I'm capable of anything It's frightening, those thugs still out there Olga wouldn't like to hear you talk that way I know, I know her theories and we've argued many times But whoever should pay, should pay How curious, a mature liberal magistrate and a young conservative lawyer Curious, yes But Olga's father or brother weren't killed Sorry, there's a phone call Thanks. Just a moment Did you bring the money? - I don't have it - You have a big mouth I'll pay when I can Cobra won't like that Fuck him and the rest of you Are you high? You can kill me, but I'll not go down without a fight, you'll have to work! You'll have a big batch tonight Some prime stuff for you Pure horse, the best on the market Save me! A disposable syringe, very fancy Have a nice trip to paradise, asshole - Your friend's recovery was a miracle - He's very strong - May I smoke? - Yes, of course He's often at the station He's gone over 100s of pictures Says he doesn't recognize anyone, but I think he's lying Why would he do something like that? He'd want his family's killers to pay, to have them caught and jailed Of course But I fear he doesn't trust the police or the courts He thinks it's all too slow, too bureaucratic, that criminals are just in a revolving door Explain yourself Olga... Dr Arranz isn't the same as he used to be, I think his views on right and wrong have changed a lot I don't think he'll stop until those that destroyed his life are dead And if possible he'll kill them himself That's absurd Commissioner, Hugo respects the law, he's a good man But that was before Anyway, perhaps my fears will be proved wrong and he won't get in trouble No one need take the law into their own hands We have judges, sheriffs, lawyers, laws The death penalty, blood debt, vengeance, those things degraded mankind for centuries Luckily things have changed It's true, but sadly there are people who don't understand that The blame is not theirs, Commissioner It's society's fault, with its prisons, with its dead ends Are they given a chance to reform? Medieval jails, humiliation, degradation, sickness... Suicide I have to go now. Speak to Hugo, help him - You know him well -I'll do all I can I know, and he deserves to recover, he's a good man - I'll show you out - Thanks Yes, I know who you mean It's a while since I've seen him. Just a second What'll it be? Beer? Coming right up These days you have to be careful, baby Yeah, with this AIDS thing you have to watch out I'm very busy here You want Gloria? She's alone at that corner table Be careful, they say that chick is dangerous The Colombians are here Thursday You and Rambo will get the merchandise I'll give you the location later This deal is important. I don't want the slightest error No problem, boss. It'll be fine I feel like shit, this asthma is a fucking curse Is there anything else? No, you can go. We'll be in touch again soon - Goodbye boss - Goodbye Goodbye... Goodbye boys I can't talk here, let's go to Matt's house She's like a mother to me It'll be 10,000 plus the room So you're a doctor? I like doctors a lot When I was young, my boyfriend was a gynaecologist The poor man died in the silliest way, fell in the street and split his head It was a tragedy Now I see myself as a widow like you Many men have come through my life and my bed, but none like my Gaspar The poor man is dead And not to disparage anyone, but he was a real man Though you're a widower you're not looking bad too Doctor, you remind me of Brando from the Godfather Put two nuts in your cheeks like they say that son of a bitch had you'd look just like him. Poor man is a butterball now, Probably has big tits, like me Gloria, make me a snack, I've a fierce appetite And offer this nice man something, he seems like a real gentleman OK It's all in the freezer, smoked salmon too Do you like opera? I love it Especially Verdi. It's relaxing, you know? My girls are like my daughters, but Gloria's my favorite She has a heart of gold and is very loyal, she'd make any man happy You know that an age difference isn't important And it's not good for men to be alone Forgive me, I'm an incorrigible matchmaker And she's already seeing that bastard Rambo A bigger dope-head than Ben Johnson He cheats on her, he beats her, he makes her miserable And me, what can I do? I can't do anything, just stay quiet Fuck, it's him, it's Rambo. Do you know him? My god, that man's a snake I don't know what you want with him but be careful, be very careful I read some place that Woody Allen said this, "I'm not afraid to die, I just don't want to be there when it happens" You get me? Come in Olga Please, sit - Hello, Enigo - Good afternoon Here's the full dossier The data is exhaustive, all vetted and guaranteed You'll see the reality of our jails is horrible I'll do my best Senator Velasco, yes, they're delinquents, but also human beings And treated worse than animals We have to change the system, give them a chance of rehabilitation Enough hypocrisy Olga, you know how things are Robberies, attacks, rapes, murders, people are very upset People buy weapons, shopkeepers take the law into their own hands, they're afraid Society has to defend itself and jails are necessary I'm not so sure But even so we can't allow conditions to be as they are Agreed, agreed, I'll show your report to the assessors We take it very seriously Goodbye Enigo, I hope you can do something Olga, I've missed you so much I'd like to go back to the good times we had Not anymore, and remember the saying: "We're only loved by those to whom we can show our weakness "without arousing their fury" - Good quote - And true Goodbye We must have dinner one evening Try it, you never know We women are unpredictable Someone at the Black Owl told Rambo they saw me with Mr. Arranz He did a horrible number on me, he threatened me I'm really scared Mati Why are you still with that bastard See how good Dr Arranz is So educated, so dignified, and most of all so loaded Mati, the doctor is mute There's not many like him He might be everything you want, but I'm scared, I'm scared Rambo is a savage, I can't take it anymore You shouldn't have gone with him. I did warn you I know, I know, but I... Don't worry, I'll speak to Dr Arranz He's a good man, he'll help you Don't make that face He'll sort out something Hey babe, you're old, but still fuckable, real fuckable - She's too much woman for you - Leave me alone Well handsome, do you want a good time? Of course doll, of course Then stick a cat up your ass That stupid bitch isn't getting away with that Don Hugo, it's an authentic speciality No one makes sweet cakes like mine Go on, try them I know where that thug is Please don't let anyone know that I told you You'll find him here Mati, the photographer just called Says he needs three girls for Thursday With good bodies, willing to do anything I hate that pig, but he pays well and we have to make a living You understand, Doctor? Doctor, you're very pale and you have such sad eyes, You should make love more often or do it better Lina, please Gloria is too young, she lacks experience and finesse Why not try with me? When compared with what I do, the Kama Sutra is just a game... for babies Lina, you're a whore Go on, get out. Don't piss me off So long Doctor, and don't forget what I said A lost cause, that woman You're going already? For the love of God, be very careful Sacred heart, protect me If something happens to me, may I get to heaven before the devil knows I'm dead Amen We saw you Gloria With a guy whose clothes screamed money When Rambo finds out he'll go nuts What's so great about him? He's more wrinkles than my grandad Leave me alone, it's my business And it's my life Your life, maybe, but you might lose it Fuck, she puts on airs Good evening slut Remember me, you old hag? I wouldn't advise it, you'd be committing a grave crime Crime? She says crime, you hear that Spark? What crime? We just want you to spread your legs and give us a good time We aren't selfish, we want it to be good for you too You look like a slut, don't pretend you don't want it we'll give you a big dollop of sex... Auntie Let's get her Slut, you know you want it! Hey, man... What the fuck do you want? Are you mute, asshole? Let's get him Fuck this, I'm always last Hey guys, someone's coming Olga? Are you there? Shitty old bag We have to leave, the fireworks will bring a crowd My god, Olga What happened to you Olga? What did they do to you? Who were the bastards, who? No one laughs at Rambo, least of all trash like you You're gonna tell me everything I want to know Slut, you're gonna tell me who that old piece of shit you've been seeing is! - I swear that- - I bet you charge him, right? Or do you put out for him for free, bitch? He's a good person, he just wants to help me See? You just admitted it Well now, you're gonna tell me who he is If he wants to fuck you he has to pay me and a pretty penny too Old pigs like that are always loaded No, I won't tell you anything pig! I won't talk even if you kill me! I'm going to tear you apart, slut! Where the fuck did this cunt come from? How did you get in? Who are you? That face... I swear I've seen it before That stupid face Listen grandpa, you don't know what you've got yourself into I'm gonna cut your balls off and hang them on your ears Poor Mrs. Reyes She spends her life defending gangsters and thugs in court, gets them out of jail, tries to help them, and in the end they repay her like this She's a good-looking woman She provokes people and these things happen Don't be crude Olga Reyes is a great professional and deserves respect Luckily I got there in time and saved her life Thank God she's out of danger Of course, the veteran arrives, hero of the Franco era, and with his admirable gun and first aid skills, he saves the girl I don't know what a liberal defender of people's rights like yourself would have done, but I did what I'm sure was my duty, and what's more, if I could have I would have killed that trash I'm sure of that, the guys in the old days had it easy They were better at torture than Fu Manchu And they just ignored human rights Everything was permitted, beatings, burning, water boarding... Inspector, all I want is to get to my retirement alive and rest I have two dogs, a small garden, I like agriculture God's given me 3 precious grand kids and a wife who's a good cook All very nice and cozy A good retirement for the bloodhound A good bloodhound because policing's in my blood And I won't stop doing it while I have a badge and gun You had a reputation for being hard Commissioner Hard but just I defended victims' rights before the aggressors I don't agree with that Listen young man, pray no one rapes your mother or girlfriend or sister It's possible your opinion on human rights would change fast Yes? Where? We're on our way They killed a guy in a hotel room, two explosive bullets His chest looks like hamburger Let's go Yes, I know them, sometimes they were with Rambo I know where they hang out I dig myself deeper every time Maybe when I want to get out it'll be too late An old friend of mine, an old fashioned type, had this saying that stuck with me "When the sea hits the rock "the one that ends up losing is always the mollusc" and in this case Mr. Arranz, I'm the mollusc Believe me Mr. Arranz, I'm the mollusc That Bronson, real brave on TV If he had to deal with Rambo or one of them he'd shit his pants Movies want us to believe any shit Tonight we'll have a great orgy Son of a bitch, who are you, what do you want? Dammit Crow, it's that rich guy whose tongue we cut off I know it! We left him deader than my grandma Then he's come back to life You're dead, cocksucker Don't kill me, please don't kill me Pay attention, pay attention All look at the cucumber, girls It's lovely, shiny, thick A good suppository for you, eh Jordi? You can borrow it later, you whore, right now we're working That's how I like it my pretties, now everyone look at the cucumber No, make your looks more saucy Hold still That's art, quality art Jordi is expecting you - How's it going, Jordi? - Hello Ralph The fatty sent me some bad material this morning Fortunately everything that Jordi captures in a lens becomes a painting worthy of Vermeer The boss, do you know what he wants? I don't know, but he sounds mad Go up and see for yourself You'll see how worked up he is Hello cutie, so good looking Don't touch me, faggot One day you'll kiss my ass and it'll be picture of the year That's enough of that Come on... Everyone look at the cucumber Come on, with gusto. Up with your cucumbers Hit me hard, more, more! Enough! Go, I'll let you know when I want to restart the session Ralph, I'm concerned by what's happening The death of Rambo and the others... It's more than just payback I agree These executions are the work of a professional, but who? We'll find out boss I've set up a deal with that pig Amir, but I know the drugs are just a cover They're terrorists and are going to attack an embassy They've got two car bombs Spark, send them to hell, blow them up with their bombs There'll be nothing left of them, I assure you Boss, I'll find that executioner and take him down I hope that goes well Whoever's killing us on the streets, it worries me Tread carefully We can take care of ourselves - Now go, I'll be in touch - We'll await orders Goodbye Very unpleasant, why do you show them to me? They're all criminals And someone is killing them with surprising efficiency I see, and I'm not surprised Violence has become a national pastime Pushers and drug addicts are everywhere People use infected syringes at the beach They drug themselves in school, in church Someone sweeping all this trash away seems normal to me What a change What about your theories of redemption, justice and understanding the criminal They hadn't defiled me, those beasts hadn't violated me then It's not the same in the newspapers or on TV happening to others than it is to suffer it yourself Yes Have you seen our friend Dr Arranz? He did visit me at the clinic, but he's not been for a while What are you getting at? What's been happening I still don't have any evidence but I've reached a conclusion Come in - The coroner's report - Thanks Marcus What conclusion? I have several candidates and my gut tells me Dr Arranz is mixed up in it That seems absurd to me Let's see. The investigation is underway and there might still be more surprises A bit more salt and a pinch more saffron it'll be finger licking good Don't be sad, you'll see everything will work out Mr. Hugo will help you Rosa, my life has been hell I'm only 24 and I'm already sick of everything Don't talk like that. Life is beautiful You're a country girl, you've always lived in these mountains Believe me, very bad things happen in the city Look, I may be a country girl but I know what goes on there The madam and Miss Elena, I loved them, and they killed them My parents died a long time ago and now Mr. Hugo is my only family I understand I know it means a lot to him The country home is his place of rest, his refuge - Hello Rosa - Hi That smells good I got the potatoes and garbanzos. And the lettuce - How are you Ms. Gloria - Hi Ms. Gloria, being so pretty you should always be happy Look at Rosa, she's a dog and she's always happy Lucky you're a kid, Rocky Because I called you a dog? One day you'll wish you married someone like me What, with women like Sabrina and Sam Fox around? Get out If you're late Mr. Antonio will give you a hiding You're much prettier when you laugh Go on, beat it - See you tomorrow - Goodbye Rocky "Pedro Valez Sayed, alias Rambo, born October 4th 1960 "Priors: armed robbery, rape, drug trafficking "Salvador de Moriaf, alias The Crow, priors..." You made me jump, I didn't hear you come in How can you be so silent? They're reports on the dead criminals found in the files Olga asked me study them They deserved it, their own violence turned against them Someone's meting out justice You need something? "Don't get in too deep, it's dangerous" Shit Now this son of a bitch is blocking my light Get out of here before I split your head I had a horrible nightmare. I dreamed I was being murdered Being completely isolated here, I don't know if I can take it I don't know Hugo, I know what you're doing, I followed you I want to help you Your presence on the streets helps people feel safe You're cleaning up the city For your family, for mine, for Olga For the innocents who suffer the consequences of violence every day I want to help you Alright Yusef, we'll seal the deal Cobra will be happy You want to count the money? Not necessary. Cobra good client, I trust Until next time, then - Fine, next larger quantity - What? We need more money Much money, much needed for our poor brothers We're an oppressed people We have a revolution waiting But... If Cobra wants more drugs he must pay more money More drugs, much more money Agreed, there'll be a deal, man Damn shithead zealots Son of a bitch I'm glad you're helping Gloria Those killers won't find your farm. It's a good hideout Cobra? I started working the streets, and with time made a decent living A nice house, some savings But now I see things I don't like And I've worked with very bad people And now I'm tired, very tired I'm too young to die, but we all have to go sometime In the newspaper yesterday, in the "Faces in the News", the last picture on the right in the upper corner that's Cobra They are bad people, very bad people - Hi Rocky, how's the fishing? - Terrible Ms Gloria, not one bite and I'm using bait that the fish here love I know you like treats, Rosa told me She's always talking about me, calls me fatty and says I eat like a pig I say she has a hamburger face What's wrong Miss, you seem sad suddenly I'm scared Rocky, I have a bad feeling I don't care what happens to me, I lost everything long ago But I'm scared for you, for Dr Arranz, for Rosa You've given me so much love, help, understanding - Miss, please... - Now I've really started to live If I'd known people like you before how different things would have been Don't worry, we'll defend you Mr. Hugo is Batman but no cape, and I'm small but strong Anyone trying to harm you must deal with me With you I know now I've nothing to fear - Of course Miss - Thank you, Rocky Thanks? No need for that, I like you a lot You're very pretty and good Now maybe, but I did very bad things When I tried to stop it was too late I don't want to see you sad again. The fish aren't biting, so let's go back We'll talk and Rosa will make us pudding - OK? - OK, let's go It's empty this time of year. No-one comes here The summer's different I have a great time then. Lots of boys and girls show up - So, girls, is it? - It's wrong for me to like girls? No, but maybe you should wait a bit - So my mother says - Well she's right If I ever have a son I want him to be like you I'm just a country kid, like Rosa You're a great kid Rocky The prostitution ring, the distribution and sale of drugs, the protection racket, all down There's fear That madman going around killing people may bankrupt us What sort of police can't catch that killer? We pay taxes for this? Boss, there's no danger, you're well protected But the others fear running into the executioner at any moment That bastard isn't acting alone, it's a group, I'm sure of it I wouldn't be surprised if the government were behind it They have to clean up cities any way they can, it's obvious What should we do? Keep working, I know how to deal with these vigilantes Agreed, I'll try to calm our people down Let them know this will be resolved very soon How's your asthma? Better, I'm using a new treatment that's very effective That's it for now boss, goodbye Goodbye Here you go handsome, thanks It was risky, but I've learned everything I can tell you, it wasn't easy, given how suspicious the fat one is We still need a few more details I'll make her sing better than a canary So you'll pay me what you promised? Cobra's a man of his word And what's more, a job like yours deserves a little extra Thanks Ralph, you guys are great You look good, you must've slept well Thanks to the pills You city people always fill yourselves with garbage Mr. Hugo wants you to stay inside I hate being locked in here all the time I'm drowning, Rosa Fine, but if the master finds out, God help me! - You know what I'd like? - Oh no... To pick mulberries from those bushes You filthy sow, sing or I'll fillet you Where the hell is that damned house? In the hills, 11 kilometers away from Paola That's better, butterball You're going to pay for your crimes One less whore Lina, come closer - Why Ralph? - I feel like kissing you We must try the Kama Sutra again. Remember what a good time we had? I want it Ralph But first I'll give you your reward? - Now? - Sure, doll "I'm at the town house. I've some documents for you there. "It's urgent” Ralph, tell Lefty and the rest I want to finish this thing once and for all This time it's all well set up I've heard that before, but overconfidence gets men killed It'll be fine - I trust you. Goodbye - So long boss This is Olga Reyes answering machine Elvira, I had to leave in a hurry I received an urgent message from Hugo He's waiting for me It must be something serious. I'll call when I can Take care of the pending cases, goodbye I feel very comfortable being around you Soon the Alameda festival will begin, we'll go, you'll see There's games, dancing, you'll have a good time Mr. Hugo said I mustn't leave the house Yes, but we're very remote here, nothing will happen We won't say a word to Mr. Hugo, right Rocky? - And I'm here to defend you - Superman has spoken Go to the kitchen for the potatoes Yes Rocky, they've killed you, they've killed you!
