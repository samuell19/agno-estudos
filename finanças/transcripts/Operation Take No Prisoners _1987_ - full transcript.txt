(suspenseful music) - Who are you? - Be very, very quiet. - What are you doing in my house? I demand you tell me, what are you doing in my house? - Sit down. - What do you want? What do you want? - Here, eat this, you'll need it. Call your family down. - No, no, leave them out of this, all right? - Call them down. Now! Do it! No mishap. - Sandra, Jackie, come down here now. - [Jackie] It's late daddy, I'm in bed. Can't it wait till tomorrow? - Both of you come down here now. - Tell her that if she doesn't come down you'll drag her down by her hair. - Sandra, come down here now. - [Sandra] Don't yell at me, I'm not coming down. - Sandra, come here or by god I'll drag you down. In here now! - What's the matter with you? John, listen to me, how dare you turn your back on me. How dare you talk to me like that. (gunshot) What's going on here, John? Who is this man? - I don't know. - Shut up and listen. You're coming with me. You're mine for the next 24 hours. - Who the hell do you think you are? (gunshot) - Quiet. Now listen, this isn't a game. People are all alone and there's nobody going to come and protect you, so you're going to do exactly what I tell you do to. You understand? (somber music) Don't move, not even a muscle. - [Male] I don't see anyone around, it seems abandoned. - [Female] Stand high, Autumn will want to talk to you. - Damn. - 989. - [Kane] We're leaving, move it. - What about our clothes? I'm not dressed, we can't get go anywhere like this. - Too bad. - Aren't you going to do something? - I'm not going. - Whatever, whoever stays is dead. Whoever gives me any trouble is dead. Now what do you say? - Wait. - No, you got us into this. - [John] Would you keep quiet. - Why can't you be like other men? - Out! All right, Professor, over you go. You too. - I'm not going. What's that? - It's a silencer. - What's it for? - So I don't wake the neighbors when I shoot you. All right you too, get over. - I hurt my foot. - Awe, too bad. - Why are you letting him do this to us? - That was fun, want to do it again? Idiot, come on get it. - I'm not going. I'm not and I hurt my foot. I'm not even dressed. - Bitch, bitch, bitch. (faint talking) Things are heating up. Too soon. - What? - Shut up. - I'll get back to you. Johnson, Professor Hillman's my project, there's no way in hell you're going to call it off. - Both of us must answer to president, Brenner and our country. - Feed that garbage to the press. We're both after the same thing. Your way won't work, mine will. - Your way, what's that? Raising stupidity to the status of a religion? Take no prisoners, is that it, Brenner? - Stay out of the way, Johnson. If I catch your agents snooping around, I'll stop him, dead. - If you want to go to war with me, you're welcome, but I don't think you have the will, old boy. Or the muscle. - Get out of my office! - As you wish. Just remember, hands off. - Go to hell! - Yeah, I'll be damned. It's for you. - Sir, Hillman's gone. - What, how'd it happen? - There was a kidnap, some guy waiting outside. He jumped me. - Get back here, tonight and there was no kidnap. Do I make myself clear? (dramatic music) - What's the matter? - Where are we? - I'm cold. - Come one, let's move it. - Where? - We need clothes. - We can't go in there dressed like this. - I'm cold, mother. - Move it. You open your mouths, you're dead, got it? - Oh, mom. - Don't waste your time, these won't last. - Here's the clothes. Dressing room is this way in the back. - Mother, what are we going to do? Why doesn't daddy do something? - I don't know, dear, your father's useless. - That man has a gun and I don't want anything to happen to you. I think we're just going to have to put up with it for now and get away as soon as we can. - Mother, what if somebody sees me dressed like this? - I've got an idea. (suspenseful music) - [Kane] Sign it, it's your card. - My card! How did you? - Where's the kid? - Still dressing I guess. - Stay here. - What's going on? (dramatic music) - [Jackie] Hey! - Really pissing me off. Put your leg up here. - Why? - I'm going to break it to keep you from running away. - No! - Well then you behave yourself. - The police came! - What? - Come on! - Where's Jackie? - She ran off to get some help. - She did what, what did she do that for, he could kill her! - Let me go, you coward! - Sandy! - You want to live, do you? - Do you? Then behave yourself. Now, listen to me, we're going to walk out there past that cop and we're going to be very quiet, do you understand? Let's go. Morning officer, how's it going? - Fine, sir, thank you. Patrol, I think I found that stolen Chevrolet on Stark and 79th, I'll check it out and report back later. - Hey! - Shut up and do what you're told, you understand? Are you listening to me? - Yeah. - All right, get in. Come on. Well, get in! (phone ringing) - How's it going, jail bird? - I got your bird. - Yes, sir. He'll see you now. - Yeah. - Chief, I went through the files and the guy who grabbed the Professor is Kane Turk. - Turk? That son of a bitch Johnson hired him. Damn! - [LaGrange] Well, who is he? - He's freelance, not important. Any word from the university? - [LaGrange] Someone dumped the Professors research out of the main computer. Now Hillman is the only one who had access to the code. - What's his location? - I don't know, we had a report from a missing woman - - No, what's his location? - Fifty miles away. - Where's he headed? - Up north. - You screwed up, LaGrange. You lose Hillman one more time I'm going to bury you. And keep the local yahoos off this case. How long would it take you to get your squad into that area? - Consider it done. - [Officer] This is car 18, in pursuit of that Chevy. Stand by. - What are you going to do to me? My husband's waiting for me. - Damn it. - I don't have any money. Are you going to talk to me? - Shut up, everybody be quiet. (dramatic music) - Damn it, there's a cop on our trail. - Maybe we'll be saved. (police siren) (tires squealing) - Can't outrun him in this thing. - You're going to kill us! My car! - [Jackie] Oh my God, stop! (upbeat dramatic music) (screaming) (siren fading) - This is car 18, I lost that Chevy. Suckered me into a California shuffle. - Always did wonder what they called that. - This is car 7-0, we're on that Pontiac. We're going to get that son of a bitch. - [Dispatch Female] Car 7-0, leave it along guys, he's under federal jurisdiction. - This is 7-0 in pursuit of that Pontiac. I don't give a damn about no feds. They can go jurish their own diction. - Are you giving up? - You are, you're giving up. - [Jackie] Big man, one cop car and you're giving up. - Get out. Drop it! Drop it! - Please don't kill me. - I can get him, I can get him! No! - Listen to your partner, he's smart. Okay, now that we understand each other, drop it. Toss it! Now you. Two fingers. Throw it in the ravine. Take care of her. Get back in the car! All right, get in the car, take her with you. Come on. - Look out, he's going to shoot! (gunshots) - [Officer] You better call it in. - That bastard killed the radio. - Damn it! Some people are real assholes, you know that? - Brenner's men are closing in, LaGrange is leading the task force. - I warned Brenner to stay out of it. What are the projections should they reach them? - If LaGrange apprehends the Professor, then he'll get the device. That'll end the ballgame. So far, Kane Turk is staying one step ahead of them. - Who is the Turk working for? - [Man] We don't know yet. We thought he might be one of Brenner's men, but that looks doubtful now. - There's nothing left to do. Terminate the target. - [Man] The wife and daughter too? - Eliminate LaGrange and his team as well. - But they're American agents, they work for us. - No they're not, Brenner and his agency are mavericks trying to overthrow the president, constitution and take power themselves. That makes them the enemy. Gentlemen, you have your orders. - (whispers) Mom, I have to go to the bathroom. - You've got to stop. - No. - My wife has to make a stop. - [Kane] You do what you're told, shut up. - Listen, Killer, I have to powder my nose, understand? - Right. (suspenseful music) Where you going? - [Jackie] Come on, Killer, I have to go now. - Promise not to run away? - I promise. - Where are you going? - Hey, can you help us? - Yes. - [Waitress] Let her go! (crashing) - Are you okay? - They took that girl! They have a gun! (dramatic music) - You all right? - Help! (screaming) No! - Drop gun. - Put it down! - Drop gun. Long way down. - Put it down! Put it down, damn it! - Shut up! Okay. - Good. (gunshots) (crying) - It's your fault, she could've been killed. - Come on, let's go. Come on! - Do nothing funny or I will have last laugh. - Hey, your wife, they took her, they had a gun. - Wait here. (suspenseful music) (crowd chattering) - Come on, you drive. - Which way? - Left. - How do you know? - [Kane] Turn left you son of a bitch. - Here, try this one. (gunshots) - Stop shooting, you'll kill her. Too high, you son of a bloody car boy. - [Kane] Drive! - Hi, don't move. - Please. - We have what you call Mexican standoff. You give me Professor, I give you bitch. - I'll do it if you let her go. - Okay. (gunshot) Let's go. - Why? Why are they doing this? Why are you doing this? - We don't have time for this, now get in. - Russian agents, Chief. - Hmm. - How should I call it in? - Murder/suicide, I should think. - Juan, better send the meat wagon, we're going to need a shovel. - Well, they won't get too far. - We walk. - Where, this is the middle of nowhere. - Come on, get moving. - I'm not going. No, not another step. What's going on? Everybody's got guns. They're shooting at us. They kidnapped my daughter. They grabbed me from the restaurant. They're trying to kill us and we didn't do anything. I just need to know why this is happening to us. - Ask your husband, he knows what this is all about. - I don't know what you're talking about. - However you want to play it, Doc, now get her up. - Tired, I stink. - I'd love a glass of water. - I'd like a nice, cold beer. - Don't torture yourselves, we're almost there. - Where? - There. Think you can make it? - Yeah. - They're on foot, they went that way. - All right, stay here, I'll check this place out. - What happens to us now? - You're safe. - Everything's all right. - He kidnaps us from our house, he shoots it out with the police, this madman almost gets our daughter thrown over a bridge and you say everything's alright. - Does this woman ever stop? - I'd shoot you for what you've done to us. I just wish I had your gun. Don't you have any backbone, do something. - Bitch, bitch, bitch. I'd of dumped her ass a long time ago. - You have no right to talk to my wife like that. (laughing) - Okay, let's see, they're heading north and the road winds around the mountain here and there's a cabin here. I think we got them. Let's move out. - What are you doing, leave me alone, no! - Mom? - Why? - Your project, Professor, you destroyed the prototype, dumped the computer files and burnt the blueprints. You're coming back with me to redesign it. - I can't let you have it. - If I don't get your commitment, Professor, I have to eliminate your family. - You butcher, I'll never give you what you want, you'll have to kill me too. - (laughing) You're too valuable, Professor, or shall I say, your little project is valuable. - Tell me what it is, please, I want to know what we're supposed to die for. - You're married to a genius, Mrs. Hillman, your husband's invention will allow us to monitor any communication, any conversation, anywhere in the world. No one can be shielded, no one can hide, but your husband doesn't want to give it to his country. - You want it for yourself, you don't give a damn about the country. (grunting) - Bullshit, think about what you're doing. You're executing your daughter. Show him. - No, no don't do it! You got to let her go, that's my baby, no! You bastard, you don't have any right to her, let us go! Leave her alone! No, you can't do that to her, that's my baby, no! - See that, Professor, that's your daughter there. You're responsible for this. (gunshot) What the shit? - Jackie! Jackie! - You and you stay with me. You, no matter what, protect him with your x. Let's move out! (gunshots) - Mommy! - Jackie, get him off. Honey, are you okay? - Hi, be quiet. - What about daddy? - I know, get over here, lie down. Be quiet, don't worry, it'll be all right. (gunshots) Come on, move it, move it! - They got away. Yeah, they got away. Listen, I need more men now! (gunshot) - Where we going? - Anywhere, just away from those guys. - Why'd you have to go and be a genius. - It wasn't my idea. - Debate later, run now, come on. Come on, there, let's go, go! - Echo prime, this is Echo one. - [Echo Prime] Echo Prime here. - The target has escaped, repeat, the target has escaped. - [Echo Prime] What about LaGrange? - He's down. - [Echo Prime] Excellent, continue your mission. - Come on, let's finish it. - Come on, let's go, hurry up. Goodnight. - How do we get down from here? - Come on, let's move it, we got to get out of here fast. - No, I'm not going down there. - Right, come on, hold this. - Where did this come from? - For emergencies, and this is definitely an emergency. (screaming) (gunshots) (explosion) - Go! (yelling) - I'm going, I'm going. - Where's your kid? - I don't know. - There she is. - I need help, I need a ride. - Sure, get in. - I need your boat. - No. - I need your damn boat, get in! Come on! Now drive. - Echo five, this is Echo one. - Echo five. - They've commandeered a jet boat, they're heading your way. - They won't get by us, moving out. - [Sandra] They're leaving. - [Kane] Good, they're poor shots anyway. Let's go find your kid. - Hey, let's party now. - No, I'm sure you're a nice guy, but I can't do this. - Come on. - No, no you don't understand. - Hey, come on. - No, no, no! - They got away? That's fine, cancel the mission. - Sir, what about Turk? That son of a bitch is lucky as hell, we lost six men. - That's not important. What is is that Brenner is backing off. He'll finish our mission for us. - Yes, sir, we're falling back now. - Fall back. Fall back, disengage. - 10-4. - Hey! - Hey, Chief, the Professor got away. We're pinned down here by Echo team. - Destroy Echo team, consider CIA, Army Intelligence and anybody else the enemy. Kill Hillman if you have to. - Hillman to be terminated, are you sure? - Do it, if we can't win, we're not going to lose. Take no prisoners. - I think I poked my side. I think I cracked a rib. - Is he okay? - He's all right, he's been hurt worse in touch football. - Got about a mile to go, then you'll be safe. - You're hurt. - It's nothing. - [Sandra] Nonsense, no let me at least take a look at it. - Leave it. - No, come on. - I don't see much, but let's get it fixed. - Here. Where we going now? - There's an airport about a mile from here, I got a plane waiting. It'll get you to safety. I don't think there's any place that we'll be safe. - Believe me, Professor, there is such a place. - Wait, I really want to thank you for saving our lives. - Don't, this is just a job. I don't want to know you and I don't need your thanks. Understand? Now, come on. Long ways to go yet. - Alpha, x-ray, tango 3-2-9er, this is section leader we are ready for takeoff. - Excellent, section leader. The target is on foot in sector 11, you know your mission. - All right men, let's get this bird in the air. - Sector 11, oh shit, he's headed for the airstrip. - I didn't know you worked for the government. I thought you worked on bugs and things at the university. - I do, my device was to detect and count species by their sounds. Trouble started when Jack Pierce came to get a real look at it. - Who's Jack Pierce? - You've met him, he works for the Department of Defense. - Oh, is he that guy who stinks, the one with the greasy hair? - He brought people around to look at it. One was that guy at the cabin. I overheard him and Jack talk about the possibilities. So, I destroyed the device. I didn't think people would know. - And you were going to let us die just so they couldn't have it. - It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but I had to do it. The alternatives were just too awful. - I'm proud of you, daddy. - You are? - I think it was heroic, but don't let it happen again. (giggling) - Oh, no. What's the matter? - You hear that? - No. - Look, parachutes. - Oh, how pretty. - Damn. - What? - We have to get out of here. - Why? - They're not jumping for our amusement. (gunshots) (yelling) Don't move until I get back. For God's sake, don't get you fool head shot off looking for me. If I'm not back in 10 minutes, you run like hell in that direction. Got it? - Yeah. - Come on. - No, wait, wait. (grunting) - Are you okay? - Yes. Let's go. - Move it! Stop it! Get out! Out! (yelling) - You okay? - Yes. Nice shooting kid. - Thanks. - Come on. - [Sandra] Look! - We're at position five, we've got them trapped. (gunshots) - [Kane] Get down! - Damn. Denahi? - Denahi here. - Got the log? - It's yours, stand back. - Stand clear! - Shit, get out! - All right, good job Denahi. All right, men, let's move out. - The bodies, sir? - Leave them for the maggots. - They're leaving. - Sloppy work. All right, this way. - You lost Hillman. - We all did, sir. - Well, maybe the lab boys can salvage something from the prototype. - I really wanted that son of a bitch, Turk. I hope to God he suffered. - We can only hope, return to base. - Roger. - All right, this is the place. Plane'll be here any minute. - You never did tell us why it is you did this for us. - You'd never believe me. - Well, as you say, but I really want to thank you. - Okay. - I want to thank you too. Although I wish you would've told us what this all about from the beginning. - Would you have believed me? - No, but you could've at least tried. - Sometimes fear works better than bouquets. - Goodbye, Killer. - You take care, kid. All right, there's your plane. One last time, move it! - Step on it! - Damn it! - [LaGrange] Damn it, bring that plane down now. - Don't move. Do it, I'd like that. Get on the ground. - Go to hell. - Do it! You really piss me off, you know that. - Kill you for this, bastard. I'll rip your head off with my bare hands. Bastard, I'm going to kick your ass! - [Kane] Looking for me? - All right Turk, this is it! You and me, babe. Don't even try it. Come on, Turk baby, come on! Come on, come on, Turk. Come on, come on, come on! - I thought you were a federal agent? - Yeah, I'm a fed. - Well, if I've broken a law, you jerk, arrest me. - You just don't get it, do you? We are the law. - You really are a gangster, aren't you? (loud chattering) - I have no comment. I have no comment. I have no comment. (dramatic music) (phone dialing and ringing) - [Man] Yes. - [Kane] Good evening, sir, I'm on an outside line. - [Man] I see, problems? - [Kane] No, sir, I'm returning tomorrow. - [Man] And my suit? - [Kane] It's back from the cleaners, spotless. - [Man] Excellent, and what of the hounds? - [Kane] They're in the doghouse. - [Man] I see, goodnight, Turk, and thank you. - [Kane] Goodnight, sir.
