(MUSIC ONLY THROUGHOUT CREDITS SEQUENCE) MICKEY: The ride was over. I was trapped. And I find out I owe suddenly a fortune. We made a deal: I work and pay back. They'll okay me, I can keep twenty dollars a week. They'll let me know when I'm paid up. Stick, kid. I know. Ruby, what did I do? What do they want? MICKEY: What did I do? They're sore I been cutting out too much on the job? Huh? All right, so tell me how they set me up, at least? Shootin' craps, drunk... that's the only thing they could've. Hey, how much they fix I should lose? You can tell me that. What, five grand? Ten? Twenty? Tell me! No. But why? What...? Was it the girl? I've been playing around this time somebody's private stock? She ain't private any more. Who owns me? Ruby... Stick. You know, I really was nuts about that girl. (INAUDIBLE) MICKEY: I couldn't be funny even if my life depended on it... ...and it did.

They brought his ventilated body out here, transferred it to one of the used car beauties you see above you right now, and passed it gently through the air. (SCRUNCHING METAL) And somehow our boy just never made it to court in the morning to testify about his sources of revenue. Or anybody else's. Neat. Then they sent him through channels to the steel furnaces. No mess, no body for the family to scream over, or the papers to report on, or the police to identify. Total death.

You see, they don't have a club at the Ritz Gotham, just a Starlit Roof. I couldn't afford a room, and it was a warm night... (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER) COMIC: I used to be quite a fella... (FLAMENCO TUNE) (SPORADIC APPLAUSE) Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. And I say that from the bottom of my cups. (JUST MICKEY APPLAUDING) Still there, huh? Boy, you've got an iron constitution. And if you don't watch it, your constitution is going to rust. And speaking of constitutions, I used to be quite a fighter. I really was. I'll never forget my first opponent. He was also my last opponent. He was a little guy, he only came up to my chin. MICKEY: Trouble was, he came up too often. Watch it, Buster. You've heard of ground beef? I'll never forget I had this opponent covered with blood. MICKEY: Yours. Kid, when you're working... ...do you come and monkey around with my mop?

(CYMBAL CRASH) (SLOW JAZZ DANCE) (APPLAUSE) How do you do, gentlemen. Welcome again to the Pickle Club. You all remember me, the human tranquilliser. I'm the management's answer to the cold shower. A tidal wave just wiped out all sex in Chicago. Georgie, I figure I'll spend another month or here about... Free band, nobody listening. I'll work up the whole act, and you'll get me a booking someplace human. Even all night, away the hell out in a neighbourhood spot. But women in the audience, at least. And guys living. They got in them laughs I can get to you. And the eyes on them closed sometimes. And they listen at least to me. Not like that other place. If I can just last past the night. Did you talk to the fat guy yet, tonight? No? -(BAND STARTS UP) -Mickey, I think it's time. The band. Hey, boy! Don't you know it's time? Hey! Going to have a little talk with your agent here, see can we keep you over. You want to get paid, huh? How much? How much, huh? I'll pay you poison! You can take your head of lettuce and stuff it in the Drainage Canal. I said get out of here! Hey, you got the wrong place. We don't use broads here at the Big X. Well, no, Mr Fryer, please. I got now a high class, a boy... ...a comic. You wouldn't find it a finer. I don't care. The Drake Hotel, the Waldorf Astoria, A Polish boy, a beauty. Made for here, this club. Dance, plays, sings, his own material, jokes. What's his name? His name? Mickey One. You didn't heard yet, but wait, he... Ed Castle's in complete charge here, all this kind of stuff, I'm just the business. Ed, listen, that little period flesh-peddler guy's out here. Maybe you can give him a minute? Who knows?

His own material. He sings, dance... What's his background? -What? -Where has he played? He plays now in a nice tavern on the West Side. -No? -No. I'm sorry. But come only to look. Mr Castle, I promise you... No. I'm sorry. FRYER: Hey listen, Ed, maybe... ...we could at least go look at this guy. He looks... He could be a bargain. Course, I'm only the business end.

What, are you bringing him here where I live? It's all right, my boy. It was my idea. I'm here to help you. What's happened to you, Mickey, since Shaley's? Are you worried about the sudden jump to Rush Street? All right. I'm going to New York tonight. This is my offer: Seventy-five dollars a week over what we discussed and we'll defray the cost of any new arrangements. Run-throughs start the day I get back. Sunday week. And any favours, or extras that you find you need, we'll gladly absorb. Now don't hesitate to ask me about... -Why? What you said. I'm not ready for the jump. My boy, there is no jump. Not for people like you. Your talent is a bridge. You'll walk across. Mickey, the successful comic is the king of show business. People, respectable strangers, they'll stop you on the street just to touch out at you. Driving, you'll drive a milk-white Cadillac with a portable bar and air conditioning. Your name across the pockets of your custom silk pyjamas. You'll have everything you ever prayed for. Money, clothes, success. Al Jolson had a hundred and fifty overcoats in his closets when he died. No, now wait, you can't... I want you! You're throwing away an opportunity. Let me help you. (LANDLADY SPEAKING POLISH) All right, the hell out! Come on, out! -She said you were being... -You! ...that you knew. I just gave her nearly all my money. It's dark out. I can't... All right, the only thing I can help you out... A little room in there, you can sleep tonight. Then get your money back. It's got a lock on it. Listen, you don't interest me sexually. Talk! What are you, some kind of Mahatma Gandhi? All right. We'll work something. I'll sleep there. (DISTANT SCREECHING) Who told you to come? Ruby Lapp? Lapland? Want the place clean? (DISSONANT CHORD) Cry. What'd ya have troubles at the other place? You're gun-shy. Here you don't have to worry. The only one here's the old man. But lucky, five years ago he got smart, he got lumbago. Now she works, he sits all day, reads the want ads in the Dziennik Chicagoski in case some day somebody happens to advertise for an ignorant Polack with lumbago. To read the want ads in the Dziennik... Chicagoski. You know you made a joke? You hungry? I'll get you something to eat. (DOOR SLAMS) Don't knock, come right in! Bring a friend! It's a public place. A comfort station. JENNY: What? What? Your name's Genevieve Drayton. Your family lives in Medford, Kansas. Jenny Drayton. The other's just in case of accident. You told the truth, about the money. I thought you were lying. What kind of name is that, Drayton? American something? I guess so. My brother found some people in England, but I don't think we have any family there. No, I don't think we have any family there either. In England. We have family in Buffalo, Calumet City, Hamtramck, Warsaw. Wherever particular Polacks congregate. -Do you drink? -No. Not really. -Smoke? What do you do? To the President... Ignacy Paderewski. I always gotta have a drink in the daytime. My old man must have been a lush. Is your father...? How would I know? My mother was a waitress on a fast streetcar line. I don't want you to get the wrong idea about her. She was a... she was a tramp. Nah, I'm a wise guy: she was all right. Listen, I was the only kid in the neighbourhood who had to go out in the street to learn how to swear. She never talked dirty. Later on I found out: the words they said, she did. Honest to God, like... She never... ...you know, shanty or some fleabag hotel. I wanted I grow up like other kids. So I did. I grew up like any red-blooded American kid with six different "misters" for a father and a mother who's on a honeymoon always. She never drank or smoked. And I bet you haven't gotten a Drayton that's any better like that. Well, I... -I have a father... -That's what I mean. -No, I didn't mean it like that. -It's all right. Besides, it's different in English. So your old man's a rounder, huh? I like to hear things like that. About Protestants. I'm the only American who ever went to Berlitz to learn American. "Do you make these mistakes in English?" Their mistakes were better than my English. Are you in the... theatrical business? Why? Well, you're very quick. That's all. I'm a comic. You... are you very good? I'm sure you are. On stage I'm a Polack Noël Coward. -Ever worked a stage? -Oh no. No, I'd be terrified. Oh, I dunno. (PIANO CHORD) Sometimes it's the only place in the whole world you're free. I mean a couple of hours every night at least, you're out there on that floor, you're the best person in the world you always wanted to be. Yourself. The one exactly they want you to be. They clap for. The same. One. Where else? -In your dreams. -(PIANO CHORD) In bed. (PLAYS CHORD SEQUENCE) What? What is it? -If I could... -(PLAYS BASS NOTES) MICKEY: You don't know. You never asked me my name even. JENNY: Mickey. (COUGHING) Again? Fellow comics of the Club Lapland, I see that you too have found out that the management here is in the meat business. Prime ribs of comedian. Ruby, I can't. Three times a night go out and make jokes on my own grave. I can't. Or maybe I can raise the money and pay 'em up. You help me. Twenty thousand. It ain't the end. Why not? How do you know it's twenty thousand? I didn't say. How do you know it's only money? -Why, shootin' craps. You said.. -You said. How do you know it's not all the other crap games they tore up on ya? And the bookie slips. How do you know it's not the car they gave you, you smashed up? And the liquor, and the good times, and the apartment? And the clothes, and Christmas, and birthdays, -and the rehearsal halls? -These were favours. They're favours as long as they want them to be favours. How do you know it isn't all the trips they paid for, and the special material, and the arrangements in music? The dentist. The lawsuits, the parties, the "expenses"? Twenty thousand? Twenty thousand's just a fraction. How do you know it's not the... your whole life you're living. Big mouth in the steam baths, four a.m. So they bought me. I'm tied up here the rest of my life. RUBY: Where are you going? There's no place you can hide from them. You'll have to be an animal! MICKEY: Four and a half years I travelled, Up and down the back end of the South. An animal. Tried two, three times to get in touch with Ruby Lapp in Detroit. Nothing. Now today they're here pressuring me. JENNY: Do they know? MICKEY: I don't know for sure they know who I am or not. Yet. But I haven't got that kind of guts to stick around and find out. Couldn't you talk to someone? I talk to you. This you don't talk. Nobody's going to talk to you. JENNY: I don't understand. Anything. I mean, hiding from you-don't-know-who, for a crime you're not even sure you've committed. And the only thing I know: I'm guilty. -Of what? -You sure you don't want a drink? Of what are you guilty? Of not being innocent. What am I, a lawyer? Ed? This kid, Mickey. ED: Larry, I admire the boy as much as you do. I phoned his agent five days running to get him down here. When I get back... Would I be stepping out... Like, would I be stepping out of line if I tried with him? No! I'll get to him. I'll get to him. (PHONE RINGING) (PHONE CONTINUES RINGING) JENNY: It's Mr Castle again.

You don't know these people. (DOOR CLICKS SHUT) Get down. I'll do your back again. No, you're tired. Boy, they got me now. I'm scared to stay. I don't know if I can stand it to go without you. Darling, don't go. Let's stay. To the run-through. One day. For me. You don't have to go. -It's not true. -Shut up, you don't know... You distrust everybody. Who should I trust? -Mr Castle has phoned you... -He's in with them. ...at least three times from New York. He's in with them. How do you know? Because I don't know that he isn't. -Your own agent brought him here. -He's in with them. You're in with them. No, that's the way you've got to be, to live. Now will you let me the hell alone? Only to the run-through, darling. Just to be at the club and to see what you're afraid of. To scale it down. To make it real. Then the nightmare would be over. We could live. With the lights out at night. We could make love in the dark. We could... (TRAFFIC SOUNDS) You had me worried there. Hey, that kid. He's coming, isn't he? Yes, I should hope so. You off to pick up your people now? Yeah. Hey, but no, this Mickey, no kidding. What's the name of this person you're picking up? I need that kid to be here today. He's your responsibility. Of course he is. Gladly. I mean he's your responsibility. I mean, any extras or specials on your trip, don't forget, the company's pleasure. Well now, I picked up some art pieces that cost... The company. Just hand in the piece of paper, the receipt. The hell you're doing, anyways? The library. The one day I need you. Sweetheart, I promise I'll be at the club before you. I never went to a library Sunday in my whole life. I'm supposed to go all week. You know [I've hardly been to the office. Oh darling, you give me everything. I love you. Believe. Hey, Ed. I only got a second. I got the man with me. Did you hear from the kid? He'll be here. Now you're sure? What do you mean, you've got them with you? Where are they? Up in the light booth. Larry, what's this all about? I don't... You're sure that he's coming? ED: I'm in touch with him right now. Ah, good. Swell. Yeah. Hey, uh... They'll call you when they're ready. (KNOCKS LOUDLY) C'mon, let's get outta here. I thought perhaps I'd misunderstood you on the phone, but Mickey will be here, is that right? Oh yes, but... Splendid boy. But just for the run-through so far. You said... No, but you've double-checked with him, haven't you? About being here today. You see, I have my people out there rigging up a special audition for him. -Audition? -Don't you see? He doesn't know. Mickey trusts no-one. Why not? Do you know? Do I? Well, yes. Actually, it's the reason I asked to see you before he came. I'm not sure that he can even get by this afternoon without your help. Oh, uh, yeah, I... Oh swell, boy! -Larry? -(SECURES DOOR) What's Mickey's problem? JENNY: That was four years ago, but he... he still has this obsessive idea that he'll be "rubbed out", or... You're bleeding. (RUNNING WATER) (MICROPHONE FEEDBACK) (KNOCKING) Come in. Mr Castle. So how's it in New York? Did you hurt yourself? Where is everybody, the other acts? It's all right, my boy. You've nothing to worry about. They're coming later. What do you mean? And they're futzing around the lights out there. For a first run-through? Oh that, Mickey, they're just experimenting, that's all. All right, Mickey. Those lights are for you. It's a marvelous opportunity. I've arranged a special audition. -This could insure your career. -What audition? You didn't... I don't do any blind auditions. I promise you there's nothing to fear. There's not... not even a drummer. I can't. Nobody knows my material. That doesn't matter to this man. Why not? -Well, he... -Huh? I don't know, he seems to think he knows your work. From where? MICKEY: What's the name of the guy? What's his name? MICKEY: Huh? All right, Mickey, the situation is this. This happens to be Larry Fryer's project. -Now he's on the business side. -But you said that you... ED: I don't know the man's name. I just know he's connected with some clubs here in the Midwest, and now he's here, and they want to look you over for themselves. They? -He's here with an associate and a... -Where? -What? -Where are they? -What difference does that make? -Where are they? Where are they? Look, it isn't what... Mickey, they're back up in the light booth, but that's not... The light booth. What'd you walk me into? ED: It's not true. You're building your own monster. What's not true? Nothing. What? Nothing. I didn't mean it that way. What way? You told him? Mickey, I was sure that... You told him? -(GROANS) (INTERCOM BUZZES) -Castle. -MAN: All right, send the piece of talent out here. We're ready for him. ED: Mickey, no! There's nothing to run from. You run now, they will remember. (INTERCOM BUZZES) Wait, just a moment. These men are in a position to guarantee your future. ED: They're businessmen. All right, just a second. I'm coming out. My boy, we'll all of us be here in the same room with you. -JENNY: I was sure Mr Castle... - I told you no. I told you my life in your hands. No. What right you got to turn me in for some virgin idea you're a god with my life? You're a slut with a snake in your mouth. Die! ED: No, but I have this -replacement in mind, and I... -MAN: I thought he was a single. She's a friend. You know, but... MAN: And the little guy? The agent. But I have this other performer in mind that I... MAN: And where have you been? All right, you ready now? I said, are you ready? -Yeah. -Okay, then the rest of you out. I don't want any audience. I'm the audience. I said the rest of you, out! -Now listen... -Out! LARRY: Mickey, we'll wait there for you in the office. ED: No, I'll be using the office myself. VOICE: All right, next! Next! Hey! Okay, now turn out the light by you. Murder, anybody? What, are you laughing or aiming? Who says I don't have to do this for a living? I mean, I heard of tough audiences, but I think this is illegal. I don't even know if I'm in season. Or couldn't you just give me a gun and show me the way to the men's room? Boy, if I'm lucky, I got the greatest finish in show business.

Eleven hundred dollars. To get out of the business. Don't you understand? I'm trying to help you. Then help me. Get me a mob guy to talk to. Get out, you're wasting your time. -You're too weak for a big room. -That's all the help I want. -You'll spend your life in deadfalls. -I don't care about that. You're a talented amateur.

I swear I'm not touched by them. I happen to work in a field they control. I have the right to work. They don't control me. In the real world, you have to be realistic.

What's your name? I know you. (PIERCING WHISTLE) Hey, get him! (POLICE WHISTLES) (TARZAN YELL) (POLICE WHISTLE) (SQUEALING TYRES) (WHIRRING) (CRASHING) (CRUNCHING METAL) (RHYTHMIC CLANKING) (PENNY WHISTLE MELODY) (HONKS HORN) I can't get over it. Nobody in the whole world you can confess? Who were those men in the booth? Why did Georgie run away? Nobody. JENNY: Did they know? You can't give up. Then run! I don't understand why you won't go. You still have a chance. Ruby Lapp. Nah, no more running away. I haven't got any more the guts to live that scared. I gotta live the only way I'm at least free. With you. Are you frightened, Mickey? As long as I live. (JAZZ MUSIC CRESCENDO) Georgie? They still say he didn't live there at the hotel? He lived there. Ah, then he's got to be out front. (APPLAUSE) And now, folks, I want you to be nice to a boy who comes to us tonight with no time at all for rehearsal. He wanted a spot on the show, and we really put him on the spot. The big X. So I want you to give a big Xanadu welcome to a new, fresh and brave comedy talent. -The one and only Mickey One. -Mickey, if something happened to... Maybe you shouldn't. (ONE WOMAN LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Georgie. (MUTTERING) I played this room once before under another face. Now, any of you seen a little agent at your table named Georgie? No? Yeah, I played this room before. I ran out that time. There was something I didn't like about the audience. -There wasn't any. -(LAUGHTER) George? MICKEY: No? I lost him, Georgie, last night. I got... ...caught in a crap game with the United Nations. And this game cost me two teeth, six dollars -and a naturalised midget. -(LAUGHTER) The only thing I... I don't know if it passed or faded. If I'm next... (NERVOUS CHUCKLING) This time I ran out of running. This time I'm staying around to see my finish. Now who's up there? Am I coming through? All right, then. Let's talk about the weather tomorrow. Is there going to be any? Is there any word? Is there any word? So this is the word, huh? (PLAYS JAZZ PIANO) SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
