Screenplay by Rafael Corkidi and Carlos Illescas Can I go with you? Show us your legs! Thou shalt be our star. Go on, go to sleep, obstinate girl. Hand me a lemon. Listen... From the top of the hills, the four horsemen return Fast & furious, they've come down, looking for the Son of Man. The good, the pure, the innocent Christ will be thrown into the world. They've already got the martyr And now, the story begins. - Long live Madero! - Long live Pancho Madero! - Long live Francisco Madero! - Hurray! That night, the Rodriguez were returning from Mexico city. They were late, but didn't want to spend another night away from home. - They think you wouldn't come. - Hey! You in the house! - Open the doors! - They had to call strongly, before they opened. We thought you would've stayed at "The Ardillas" We should rest before entering the rooms. I have this endless splitting headache!! So I'm going to bed at once! Going to bed before dinner? What's wrong with Micaela? Is she lost her mind? - I will sleep dressed!! - But girl, what's wrong? Isn't that enough to going back to this filthy town? - Jesus and Mary! - Once again, forced to live in this cemetery! Micaela was unhappy since she couldn't help returning home. - Off here, everyone! She is mature enough, knows the risks: pneumonia, or a blood boil. Aunt Juanita, you stay! Yes, and I'll take the chance to avoid you to dress like that. So, my dresses may rot! my umbrellas be eaten by moths! It will not be welcome if I dress like a lady here! I can't wear my corset, or silk stockings, because I'll be judged by men! - And women! - Sacred Heart of Jesus! Everything here is hypocrisy...! I can't live here. You can't force me to it! Oh, Lord! Mexico City... that's life. I shouldn't take her to the city. I have no vocation to be a nun! I need to get married! who I could marry here? Some dummy? Never! You heard me? NEVER!!! I imagine their expressions if they see me dressed in fashion. Dusted, with my dark circles covered... With tight-clothes. And hearing me talking about what I saw, what I heard. And what I'll invent to shock them. And arouse envy. Old spinsters. And what if they note, that all men're after me. Kids and mature men, And I will snatch all the suitors. Was I really in Mexico? Or is this is just the dream I had at the prison where I live. How disappointed will be, if they think I'm still an innocent child They'll see, starting tomorrow. Starting tomorrow...

It's not news to people the end that Luis Gonzaga had. There's that loony guy walking. No, it wasn't mockery. The earthquake wasn't fun. And then, the kid's seizures, who suddenly stood up, to say: Victoria is my doom! And I will have no escape! Now I begin to learn to not crave anything, Or I will not be To finally met the Lord, Spirit of Fornication from all sin The endless death, redeem you. but deliver us from evil. Amen. What have I done to you, my people? I have preceded you in cloud columns, And you took me by your side. In front of you, I opened the seas And you opened my chest... with furious spear. Why are you stalking me? Please answer me... why interrupt me like this? When I pray for all the virgins, widows and children, Victoria, why am I thinking of you? My God, why have you forsaken me? Victoria, In truth I tell you: today, will be together in Paradise. Maria is radiant! Maria is radiant. Maria is brunette. Round face, blood-like face. Fleshy mouth. Crowned with very light joy. She has big brown eyes. Maria is radiant. Hey! Wait for me! Can I go with you? Do you sing? Do you want to join the Revolution? Do you dance? Show us your legs! Thou shalt be our star. That very night, Timoteo Limon, had dinner, literally every night. He had begun by saying the rosary. The thought of Damian scared him. Damian, the firstborn, lovely kid, mature, entrepreneur, no vices. Guardian Angel, take care of Anacleto, today marks 25 years... in bad time... I killed him. Take him, blessed Angel, how you hold a son of yours. Holy Virgin, don't leave my daughter unprotected. My God, where is she taking Damian? Blessed mantle, Virgin Mary, please let my son Damian back. How far have I sinned, Lord? At first, the loss of crops, The death of Rosalia, then, the paralysis of Anastasia, and the depature of Damian, it has been a daily agony. Confession! Our Father, who art in heaven Hallowed be Thy Name; [Singing Ave Maria] Timoteo! Timoteo, wha's wrong? Hurry! It's going to start the... "Exercises of confinement" I'm a miserable. I want to make my confession to you, dear Priest. I deserve Hell. But before that, burn me alive. No, no... please! They might see us. I don't want Maria, is Martha whom I love. Loving Maria, I went behind Micalea. Deliver me from Micaela! If you don't deliver me from her, right now I'll give myself to her and I will make her a victim of my passion! All are part of the herd Everyone, sooner or later come to this house of confinement to seek purification. those chronically ill, those spontaneous, those hopeless. The recently deceased. Those who carry weapons and have bad entrails. Those who have fallen. Those living in sin and sleeping the dream of remorse. Those who at dawn, turn to anxiety and temptations. Those who live in unhappy marriages. The old sick men. The sinners obsessed. All that offended God! So, he will order to everyone to be tormented so, each of them suffers his own torment. So, the dishonest eye, will be punished with the sighting of horrible demons! All are part of the herd Everyone, sooner or later, come to this house of confinement to seek purification. those chronically ill, those spontaneous, those hopeless. The recently deceased. Those who carry weapons and have bad entrails. There will be hunger and thirst. Weeping and gnashing of teeth. And snakes, and worms. Scorpions and hammers. And bitterness water, and spirit of storm And intolerable stench. And cold... And you, northman, what do you want to know? What you want to tell Begin to know, then. Your name is Damian. Son of Timoteo Limon. They await you at home, after five year absence. Not being a rich man you come back, not as promised by going north. But, at least, you weren't fried in the electric chair, like Eufrosina's son. Damian Limon, do listen: It will not serve to you at all what you won. You will not find interest in your home town. You will not work, but you will become presumptuous, boastful and judgmental, like all those returning from the north. You'll give bad example you'll make fun of religion Of the homeland, and Tradition. You will become a Freemason and socialist. Look at yourself! Billfish shoes, fedora, Balloon pants, cuff shirt, Cufflinks! You only miss a gold tooth to look like the gringos. To them you've served. To steal from us what they could not. Damian Limon, take care. You will be behind bars soon, by womanizing. Damian Limon, listen: if you don't leave at once, she will not be longer alive, run Damian! Run, Damian Limon! - Damian! - I came to see Mother. Hush! Lower your voice. She could hear you. Listen, your mother is very sick. You can see her tomorrow. She is very sick. I've come a long way to see her, Father. Allow me! Damian! Prudencia! Prudencia! We were in bed when a knock on the door. my dad went to see. As I was so tired, and I heard no more I fell asleep, thinking that Mom was not up. But I hear she calling me "can you attend at the door?" "I think Damian is back" But the knock on the door has stopped! I told her... Dad has returned to bed. "Go see who knocks on the door, for God's sake!" She told me. But mom, no one calls. Then, she spoke a little rough "I'll get up from bed, even with pain," "I clearly heard the voice of my little son" "Go on, hurry" She said to me. I open the door, and I see that she wasn't wrong they were, before my eyes, my father Timoteo, and my brother Damian. It would be better that crazy Micaela wouldn't to come. She looks like a whore. I will not allow it, I'll kick her out of here. Oh, God. Why I hadn't set my eyes on the Northern man before? Damian is your name, isn't? It's strange that I hadn't noticed him before. That old Timoteo. Micaela! If you want to stay here, you have to come properly dressed! I beg Lola's pardon, but you look like a whore! Who they think they are? These vulgar Limon gang! Calm down, or I'll hit you! Prudencia is going to pay for this! Girl, you have the devil inside! Today I met Damian, and Timoteo Limon, thanks... Thanks holy Virgin, for having me put in the Limon way. Listen to me! I will have my revenge on Damian. Did you hear me!? Lord, please take her off Evil, and away from lion's mouth. Let the abyss not swallow her, and not fall into the darkness. Pray for forgiveness, Micaela to St. Miguel, the victorious. Lead her, St. Miguel, pray for forgiveness! These eyes will be devoured by worms! They'll see death in this house. Timoteo Limon will be under my skirt! Do you see? The father will want to kill his own son! The son will want the destruction of his own father. Timoteo! Damian! Micaela! Micaela! Please St. Miguel, take her to your blessed light. Come out, come out, souls in purgatory! Timoteo... Damian. Damian... come, take my body! "Damn quarter" Don't get mad, Damian. I just want to say you're looking for troubles with Micaela. Are you going to shut up? It's written that, because of a female, Damian Limon will be in prison. What might be the intentions of Damian? It's always Damian. The night was unbearably hot, it felt like opening doors and windows Getting on the roof, or strip. To get naked. I'm sick of playing sad parts. I'll steal from you, at any cost Or what, are you just playing with me? - Who's this? - It's me, Damian, don't scare. - And why would I be scare? - Listen... - I don't listen. If you dare to come down here, I will scream! - What do you want? - Why you haven't answered my letter? Because, I hate to be anyone's toy. Or consolation prize. Do you think I'm like the other women? those that fall at your feet at first sight? Who could speak about your "good intentions"? I swear, just for you Micaela, I would be capable of anything just to be loved by you. - Allow me to get down. - If you dare to come down here, I will scream! Micaela... let me speak to you, as before. It would be easy for you, so you can show off a new conquest. - Put me under test, don't forsake me. - You better leave me alone. Micaela, for God's sake! Don't make me loose my caution. OK... I agree to give you a term. to prove you are sincere in what you say. And why do we need a deadline? You're not dedicated to Mary. Why does the lightning didn't kill any of them? Bastards! Why does the land didn't open to swallow Damian? Who put a bandage over her eyes, so to not see all those death omens? How is that the dogs didn't barked, when this abomination was raised? Micaela, instrument of vengeance; Micaela you opened the door to the beast. The sky clouded over at 3:00 pm. It began to sweltering heat. There was a thunder, but the horses remained calm. People also saw no sign on this. Don Dionisio born in Arandas, in the year 1850 A strict man of conscience Once died, Don Dionisio attended his own funeral. Let no one know this, dear Priest. You don't know me, I'm the poor thing Micaela. Are you Damian, by any chance? You are guilty, You left us alone... Distracted by jobs and occupations; whereas we locked in the dark, eager to see the light, consumed by the desire - I wanted a son! - Did the Evil please you? - No, it wasn't the Devil. - Then who did it? - My own desire. - It was the Devil. I told you it was Devil! I'm Micaela... and I'm close to condemn my soul... and yours. Your soul... and the souls of all the people! The whole world! I'm giving birth...! to the Devil! Oh Lord, who're you? Damian? Timoteo? - It's the Devil. - Back off Satan! it's written that you can't hurt me! Off me, Satan! Back off! Back off! Satan, off me! Damian... this is our very last night. From now on, we aren't bounded in any way. I'm not aware. I'm not listening to you. I've decided to become a member of the "Daughters of Mary". I wish to serve God. To renounce the world! "Daughters of Mary" is a carriage that leads souls to heaven. But the price is a harsh life. Filled up with sacrifice and renunciation. Those who come out of curiosity, or proud, or any other worldly cause, are thrown off a cliff! And it would been better to those, to have never pretend to hold the glorious title of "Daughter of Mary" Father Dionisio, mine'll be the heroic sanctity, the uplifting virtue, Mine will be the renunciation of the world and the triumph of the highest grace. Don Dionisio! I come to talk to you man to man. I can't speak out but from my ministry. Minister of God. - Although unworthy. - Try to understand a man like me. Do you come here for forgiveness? I came to ask you a favor. You're the only person can do it. You should already imagine what it's about. I don't, please tell me. It's about Micaela, Micaela Rodriguez. She was here. - What hast thou to do with her? - We are... well... We used to be a couple. What was the favor you wanted from me? She wants to become "Daughter of Mary" and I... don't think so. No! I can't hear you but in sacred confession! Micaela made me believe she loved me, and I think I'm right to be served! In mid-July, month devoted to "The Most Precious Blood", It began to say that Timoteo Limon and Micaela Rodriguez, would marry. Damian, in the afternoon, with apparent calm, said he wanted to talk to his father All quiet. His sister Prudencia has a hunch. She called her father, Damian, she ran to the hall, He was found dead. In the Town, it can still be heard: I didn't beat my father! I didn't beat my father! - A common crime. - A common crime. Who's there? - Who's this? - It's me... Micaela. Don't be afraid. And why should I be scared? - Listen to me. - I'll hear you, but stay away from me. - What do you want? - Why haven't you answered my letter? Because, I hate to be anyone's toy. Or a consolation prize... I swear you... I swear, just for you I felt capable of anything, as long as you love me. A person so exquisite as you, deserve a good affection. Timoteo, I thought of you all night long. If any kind soul would take good care of you, and bring you a hot cup of chocolate with cinnamon, - I listen to you, Damian. - I wanted to talk you for several days ago. I wanted to know how you've decided about my heritage. I didn't think you were anxious about your heritage... I need money. I'm going to California. I don't know how you got that idea, you have a fine work here! - I have to leave. - It's OK, Damian. - How much do you need, today? - 500 pesos sounds good. Let me see if I can collect that sum. Hold on. I think 500 pesos is too little. - Make it 1000! - You know that I can't give you that much now! - Be considerate! - To you? After you refuse to give me the properties of my mother. Damian, we have to honor her memory! Old miser! You want to keep the properties of my mother! Listen Damian, My patience is not very large. At fist, you took my mother away from me, then Micaela, and now my money! - Old thief! - I don't have stolen anything! Micaela is the Devil! And she made a Devil out of you! Uncle, have mercy on me! Father, Father! Micaela! Micaela! I come for you. Ride with me! Micaela, I said I come for you! - We are leaving here! - Damian, I'm not under your command. We'll go now. Hurry! It just happened a great misfortune! Micaela, don't tempt me! Damian... Catch him! Don't let him escape! Please don't hurt... him. He has no guilt. It's all my fault... Because I love him... I never loved like this before... Hey! Wait for me! Everything has been accomplished, This time, the earth doesn't tremble. No wind nor rain. No monstrous eclipse turns off the sun. Nobody grinds his teeth, nobody rips own clothes. It can only be see, over the mountains, the clouds that announce the next rain. Terrible words of treason, air turned black when they say, that the son of my womb has died. I know this is not true. He still lives. White face, ecstasy of love, I looked at the moonlight; April lily, tender flower, angel that I dreamed, see my pain, Come back, son of mine, come back. you promised to undertake a struggle The struggle is a dream, unattainable dream... Who knows if it was a dream. In dreams and struggles, you sketched your life. What dream? What struggle? My mind still unclear. But you will tell me... What dream was that. You dream, my son, is the man's struggle, who awaits for the glory... of the man on Earth. Of the man on Earth? Those humble beings, who suffer from hunger, death and pain... Now I remember... my faith; to stand up for the poor, to stand up for the sad, to provide homeless widows. Justice from the heaven! Justice from God! Mother, my sword! precious lamb, your life fades out. I don't care about life! if the ideal is here. Victory, victory, victory. I declare to the living... that contested the bad, It wasn't a dream... Mother! - Mary! - Huh? - Bless you! Blessed be the fruit of your womb! Blessed be your downfall! Subtitled by Spinal CG exclusive. July/2011
