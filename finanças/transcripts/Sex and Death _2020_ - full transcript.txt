- What're you doing? - Mmmmm. - What? Do you not want to? - Wow. This is the first time you haven't wanted to. Are you sure, because I think I might... be kind of close. Does that change your mind? - Yes. Yes it does. - Hey. - Hey. - I was thinking - Yes. - Maybe... we should stop seeing each other. - OK. - OK? - Yeah. - Great, excellent. - Wait, hang on... - Like, it's totally cool but... I feel like I'm very close to being kind of comfortable around you. And I think it would just take me a little bit longer I mean, this might have set me back a bit. But just, I'm really close. Do you wanna just hang out a few more times and like, see? - OK. - Sorry, I mean we'll... - No, it's fine. - It's been fun. - Give it up, dear, darling Uncle Vanya. Give it up. I'm sure you'll have pity on us and give it up. You must endure your sorrow Uncle Vanya. You must endure it. - OK, stop there. I don't believe a single word you're saying, Charlie. I don't care about what you're saying. I don't care about it because you're not invested. What're you actually telling him? - I'm telling him to return the morphine he's stolen. But... Actually I'm telling him to endure his sorrow. - You're telling him to endure his sorrow. That's what you're telling him? No, you're not telling him that. When we say pass the salt, do we mean pass the salt? - Look, I know what you're saying. But I think in this instance she really is just trying to express herself honestly. I mean, sometimes we really just want some salt. - Who the fuck wants to pay $80 to watch two people expressing themselves honestly? At every moment, every single person in the story that you're relating to, you either wanna fuck them or kill them, one or the other. Choose one! Which one? - I feel like the characters in this play want more subtle things from each other. - And what subtler thing do you think you want from him? - Well I think she wants to earn his respect. - It's a freezing cold night. I'm stuck on a tram. For over an hour. Peak hour, packed tram. Then, I pay 10 bucks for a minuscule ice-cream. I'm in the foyer, surrounded by fucking wankers. And after all that, you think I wanna watch you earn his respect? - It depends on the context. - I don't wanna see that! If I wanted to see that I would have stayed at home with my demented mother. - (Male With Glasses) Excuse me? - What? - Sometimes I just want the salt. - What? - Sometimes I just want the salt. - Nobody wants to see you earn his respect. We don't wanna see that, OK? We wanna see sex and death. - Isn't he meant to be my Uncle? - So what? He's a fucking human being. Look at him. Look him in the eyes, and decide; Do you wanna fuck him or do you wanna kill him? - Can I choose both? - Yes! Both would be great, yes! - Oh God. - Just pick one. - OK. OK, I've picked one. - When you're ready. - Give it up dear darling Uncle Vanya. Give it up. You are so good. I'm sure you'll have pity on us and give it up. You must endure your sorrow Uncle Vanya. - You must. - OK. Stop. - What was that? - Well, I was trying to fuck him. - Trying to? We don't try. You don't try. Want, actually want to kill him, to fuck him. Want it, actually want it! - Excuse me? Sorry, you're only supposed to be sitting here if you're eating some chicken. You can't eat your mushrooms here. This is a chicken shop. Did you want some chicken? - I'm vegan. I could get something else? - We're actually just closing up. I just realised. So. That's why I'm cleaning this up. - Sorry, I thought these were like, semi-public chairs. You know, like at Brunetti's? You know how you can eat sushi out the front of Brunetti's? - Yeah, I'm pretty sure you can't do that there either. There's some fully public benches at the park if you want to go and eat them there? - No. No, that's OK. I can walk and eat. - Just as long as you're off the property I reckon. You could eat till your heart's content. - Can I use your bathroom? - No. It's a rule we have. You need to eat chicken if you're gonna use our bathroom. It's kind of a rule we have. There's a cafe down there if you wanna go there? You'll probably have to buy a coffee. Just maybe don't eat the mushrooms there as well. I wouldn't want you to get in trouble. - OK. - Sorry. - No, I'm sorry. - You seem lovely. - Thank you. - Have a good day. - Hey, how did it go this morning? - Yeah, it was so easy. - She didn't care. - She didn't care? - Nope. - Oh my God, I knew she wouldn't care. This is really good, we've actually done her a huge favour. - I bet we have. - No we have! - Oh really? - Yeah! - How? - It's weird, she's weird. - Yeah. - But this is really good. - This is so good. - Pat! - Hey, Damian! How are ya? - Good man, how're you? - Yeah good. What's been happening? - The usual, just hanging out here. - Hi - Hello, are you Damian's GF? - Yeah? - Yeah, sure. Yeah, I'd be uncertain too if I was you. - Don't listen to him, he's funny like that. Pat, we're just gonna grab a couple of drinks. You wanna hang out, drink with us? - Nah. No thanks, but thank you. - No worries, what do you want? - Can I get an iced decaf latte with almond milk? - Yeah. Yes, yes you can. Pat, will you still be here, when I get back ? - Yeah, probably. - Alright, see ya then. - So what do you do? - I'm an actor. - Cool. - What do you do? - Work at a chicken shop. Well it's lovely to meet you - Tanya. - (Charlie) Tanya. - Oh my god, wait, what're you doing here? - I've got an audition at The Aviary. - Oh yeah, the dog commercial thing. - Yeah. - Yeah. They're gonna love you! Have a great audition. - You finished your mushrooms? - No, just put them in my bag actually, yeah. - I thought you were gonna walk and eat them together? - Yeah, I changed plans. - Well, you know, don't get hungry. - Yeah, OK. - So you guys know each other? - No, we just met at the chicken shop. - Wait, you're a vegan. - Yeah, I was eating mushrooms. - They sell mushrooms? - No, I brought my own. - You're allowed to do that? - I got in trouble. - Yeah, you can't bring food from home. - How do you guys know each other? - Also from the chicken shop! Good luck, with the audition. - I'm just gonna get a coffee. Can I get you a decaf iced almond latte? - No no no, I'm fine, thank you. - What about you? - Pat. - Pat. - No, thank you, thanks though. - No. You look really sad. - Yeah, I am sad actually. Damian broke up with me. - Aw babe. Oh my God. - (Charlie) Yeah. - (Tanya) That is kind of a good thing, right? - Well, not really. I mean, I know it was just casual but it had been two years. I think I kind of like him. I dunno, I think maybe I love him. - Wow. - Hi. - Hey. - How's it going? - Yeah, yeah, it's good, how're you? Good, yep, what're you doing? - Well, I just ran into Tanya. - Hi. - Do you remember Tanya, my housemate? - Hey! Yeah, I remember. - And this is... Ben. - Pat. - Pat. Yeah, no I know Pat. We went to uni together. Yeah, remember when I was doing writing? Pat. Pat from writing. - Where are you sitting, do you wanna sit together? - No, that's probably not a great idea. Maybe, what do you think? It probably isn't, but what do you think? No, it's probably not a good idea, after this morning. - Are you OK? - Yeah! Yeah, yeah I'm OK, are you OK? - I'm OK. - Yeah, I'm OK too! We're all OK, everyone's OK. - OK, I'm gonna go actually. Babe it was great to see you. Nice to meet you Pat. - Hey mate, where do you want these? - Yeah, right... Yeah, right here. - Are they meant to be takeaway? - No, that's fine. - OK... got a long black - Yep, that's me. - Yep. And I've got an iced decaf latte with almond milk. Iced decaf latte with almond milk, who's having that? - Yeah, that's mine. - (Server) That's yours? Here you go. Alright could you guys take a seat, just coz of council. - (Damian) Sure thing mate. So Pat, how's the fucking family going ay? - Yeah, good. Real good. - Still writing? A little bit? - Nah. - Come on, that feature was really good. - Thank you, but - I just realised that I probably should I should probably go actually coz of the... yeah... see ya. - See ya. That was a close one hey, wasn't it? It was good. - (Tanya) Are you kidding me? - (Damian) What do ya mean? - (Tanya) Oh my God, Damian. - (Damian) What? - (Tanya) Why? - You didn't end up getting your coffee. - Did I behave very weirdly back there? - Yeah. But no more than anyone else in that situation. - I think extra weird. - Nah. - I would of realised way sooner but I didn't even know, they are together, yeah? - Yeah, sorry. - Are you responsible? - No. You're not gonna cry and eat mushrooms again, are you? - Would you like that? - No, no. It was one of the saddest things I've ever seen in my life. Do you feel terrible? - Ah well I was about to feel stuff, but now you're here, I can't really feel stuff while you're here. - Why's that? - Well I've gotta entertain you now. - You're doing a terrible job. - Thank you. - Do you feel sad? - Well, I hate it when people know stuff that I don't know. - What do you mean? - Like they knew that they were together and I didn't know. - What, you're upset that you didn't know that they were together? - Yup. - More than them actually being together? - Yes. - That's weird. - Where are you going? - To your audition. - Hi, my name's Charlie, I'm 25. I'm 175 centimetres tall. I love acting, yoga, and going for long walks, not at sunset, but right after sunset. - (Director) OK, we'll get your profiles. Turn to the left. And the other side. And back to the front. OK, and now we'll go into the scene. - Or do you want me to deliver into the camera? - (Director) Yeah. Straight into the lens. - I love my dog, but I hate it when he has bad breath. Ew. That's why I feed him Dog Bites. The unique blend of bone, meat and vegetable ensures that he gets the nutrition he needs without the nasty scent. So now I can hug my dog whenever I want. Thanks Dog Bites. How was I? - Honestly? - Yeah. - Terrible. - I was going for wholesome but sexy. - I have a dog and after seeing that I never wanna feed it again. Do you even want the role? - Yeah, but Tanya will get it. - Why? - She's gotten every role I've ever auditioned for. She's also dated every guy I've ever liked since I met her. But usually before I get the chance, this is a new kinda low. - Oh my God. Can I punch you? - Yeah. - Now? - Yeah. - Um, why? - 'Cause you just had the worst day ever and this is definitely going to help. - OK. - Tense up. - Was that good? - Yeah it was good. - Do you wanna do it again? - No, it's your turn. - I don't wanna do it. Actually I will. - Yeah. - Did that hurt? - Little bit. But you've got like the thinnest arms ever. - But I've got good core strength. - I know. From all your yoga and your after sunset walks. - That's right. Thank you for following me around. - You're welcome. - Hang on, so how the fuck am I supposed to get all my stuff to your place then? - I don't know, get an uber or something. - I can't get an uber. I'm a full-time actress, I'm like so poor. - I didn't think you'd take this long. Hey guys. - Hey. - Oh my God Charlie, I'm trying to get all my stuff to Damian's house so I can give you some space, and Damian was supposed to help me but now he's bailed at the last second. - It's OK Tan, you don't have to do that. - No, I know, I know babe, and I don't mind, honestly I was actually kinda looking forward to spending some time at Dame's house, until he started acting like an unreliable dick. - It's three giant bags. Like how long are you trying to stay for? - I don't know, as long as it takes Charlie to recover. How long do you think Charlie? - I don't know. Couple of days. - I got plans tonight I can't stick around. - Yeah that's fine, but don't tell me you're gonna help me and then make plans to play pool with the boys. - It's tradition. - Oh yeah, you're not gonna talk him outta that. - Thank you. - Hey is Clancy going tonight? - Yeah. - Oh, I'm gonna miss Clancy. - Hang on are you guys having a fucking moment right now? - Sorry Tan. - No babe, don't you apologise, I feel like such a bitch when you apologise. - Sorry, yeah. - Is that Clancy Daniels? - Yeah. - Fuck, how is he? - Oh he is kicking goals man. - That's so good. - You fucking too? - If you knew Clancy you would get it. - Tanya why don't I just drive your bags to Damian's house for you? - No way. - That's a great idea. She can give me a lift. - You just dumped her for her best friend, she is not going to give you a lift. Pat, what do you do outside of the chicken shop? - Nothing. - Wait, you're still at that chicken shop? - Yeah. - Holy shit. - But like you're studying or something, right? - Not really. - Hang on, what are you working towards? Like what's your goal? Your dream? - Yeah Pat, what is your dream? - I think that some people, maybe the smartest people, are content with really simple things. Not that the chicken shop is simple. But I think it's really wonderful if you don't need that much for yourself. Not that you don't have much, I dunno what you have. But I mean without needing to express yourself all the time. Although you seem expressive. - Well said. But yeah, most of us are not wankers, Pat, you still are. - Damian don't be such an asshole. - Well I am an asshole that's why you like me. - You know that is actually true. I'm attracted to guy's that are assholes 'cause I have super low self-esteem, like I'm comfortable being abused. I'll even date guys that are way less hot than me, if they're assholes. - Yeah, yeah such low self-esteem. - I do. - You just said you're really hot. - Yeah, I judge myself on my appearance, that is low self-esteem. - Not when you're judging yourself really fucking high. - Pretty sure it makes no difference. - I didn't realise you guys knew each other so well. Oh, not that that's true or anything Tanya. - Babe, we didn't cheat on you. OK, I would never, ever do that to you. - It's not what I meant. - I told him I wouldn't sleep with him until you guys weren't together anymore. - Oh God it's really not what I mean. - In fact, I actually stopped it like multiple times. - Can we go? - Bye babe. - Bye, have fun. - See you guys. - (Tanya) What the, Damian! - (Damian) What? - (Tanya) Would you throw your stuff around the car? - (Damian) It's just clothes. - (Tanya) It's not just clothes, - (Damian) What else have you got in there? - (Tanya) They're very expensive clothes. - Just behind this blueish car. OK, bye. - Bye. - Hi. - (Pat) Hey. - Nice chicken shop. - Thank you. - (Charlie) Hi. - What would you like? - That's OK, I don't want anything. I just, saying hi to Pat. Bye. - (Pat) See ya. - (Boss) Just say hi to Pat You think this just social club? This a chicken shop, you sell the chicken. With the chips Oh! Where the potato cakes? You forget the potato cakes. I said this is not a social club! Work! Work! - You are so good. I am sure you will have pity on us and give it up. You must endure your sorrow, Uncle Vanya, you must endure it. - There it is. - Charlie, say your line again. - You are so good. I am sure you will have pity on us and give it up. You must endure your sorrow, Uncle Vanya, you must endure it. - There it is. - Stop, please. - OK, Charlie, I think it's the words, yeah? The words are constipating you. Engage with your intention, yes, play it, but the only word you're allowed to use, capsicum. Play your intention, but, instead of your lines, endure your sorrow, blah blah blah, it's capsicum. So what are you saying? - Capsicum? - What are you saying, what do you want? - I want to kill him and to fuck him. - To kill him, to fuck him. When you're ready. (Damian) Where are we going from? - We'll go from your cue, yeah, you stick to the script. - Leave me alone. - Capsicum. Capsicum. Caps-- - Use each capsicum as a tactic to get what you want. Allow each capsicum to express, reflect that desire, again! - Capsicum! Capsicum! Capsicum. Capsicum. - There it is-- - Cap-- oh, sorry, I was only up to the you are so good bit, OK. - (Damian) My bad. - Oh my God, babe. I'm really happy, I'm just really happy, we're so perfect for each other. Oh my God. How are you? - I'm good. - Yeah? I knew you'd be better off without him. Have you met someone else? We are just the same. We are just fucking obsessed with men. They're amazing, I mean, they're the worst but. And our chemistry, oh my God, he made me cum three times this morning. That's never happened to me before. Like, is he really good at sex or is our chemistry just really strong? Like, did he get you off like that? - He actually never made me cum. - Babe, wasn't he your fuck buddy? - Yeah. - So, why were you with a fuck buddy that never got you off? - For the hanging out bit? - Oh, what are you two talking about? - What a dick you are. - Excellent, continue. - So, Charlie told me you never got her off. Not like once in two years. How many times did you get off? - A lot. - (Tanya) Aren't you ashamed? - No, no, no I am not ashamed, I'm good at getting girls off, you know I'm good at getting girls off. I'm good at, Pat, I am the king of getting girls off. She's just weird, you're weird. - It's true, I am weird, it was my fault. - (Damien) Exactly, it was her fault. - How was it your fault? - Well, I actually think I'm not that attracted to him. Oh, what? What? - But, it's because you're too good looking. - That doesn't make any sense, but it is correct. I am too good looking, you hear that? - Seriously, I'm not attracted to attractive guys. - Yeah, that actually makes no sense. - Well, it's like, I don't know, you're too perfect, there's nothing really human about you. - M-hm, I've never enjoyed anyone saying they're not attracted to me as much as I have right now. Although, Patty, that's never happened before. Am I right, am I right? - Your personality is definitely human, though. - (Pat) That may be an overstatement. - Let's get back to the nice things. - So you were never actually attracted to him? - Not sexually, no. - Then why were you with him? - Fuck. - I guess I liked his personality. - Wow, that's the thing I like about him the least. Here you go. - Yeah, alright, OK, I got you off once though, hmm? - Oh, that is true. Yes, but you broke up with me 20 minutes later. - So, I don't know if it counts. - (Damian) That doesn't count. - Wait, hang on, you guys had sex the morning you broke up? - Yeah, he left me on a high. - Yeah. - What the fuck? - Wha-wha-what, what? - We had an agreement. - Yeah, but we were still together then. We hadn't broken up yet. Why are you looking at me like that? She was begging for it. She was asking me, what was I meant to do? I was thinking about you the whole time. - I did ask for it, but I had no idea there was anything going on between you guys, I'm sorry. - That's OK, babe, you didn't know. So, you cheated on me before we were even actually together. That is a new fucking low. - That's not, that's not possible. - Are you listening to yourself? - (Tanya) Oh my God! - (Damian) Whoa, what are you doing? - I'm sorry that I got you in trouble. At the chicken shop. - No, that's fine. - I forgot that it's possible to get in trouble. - Yeah, it was my fault, you're not really allowed to speak to friends during your shift. - There's a lot of rules at the chicken shop. - Yeah, guess so. She's an amazing woman. - That woman that yelled at you? - Yeah, she's, you know, some little girl from Italy, coming over here, then creating a really, really, really good chicken shop. She's my absolute best friend. - That's it, you are done interfering in our lives, Charlie, come on, we're leaving. - Tanya, this is silly, oh my God, I haven't done anything. Gah! - You have the biggest, most beautiful, generous spirit that I have ever seen and it doesn't matter if Damian doesn't wanna be with you, because, if he doesn't see how big and beautiful and generous your spirit is, then it's better that you're not with him 'cause you don't wanna be with someone like that. And maybe you're asleep, there's a chance that you're asleep, but I hope you're not asleep because I really want you to know that I think all these things. - Oh my God babe. I just love being single. - Yeah? - Yeah! Like, I don't need a man to give me purpose, I am my purpose, acting is my purpose you know? I can just focus on acting and a man is a fucking unnecessary bonus. - Wow. - Yeah, I've been obsessed with men for most of my life, at one point in women but mostly men and they'd controlled like all of my major life decisions, definitely my moods and for what? I'm single, dumped by a guy that wasn't even good enough, I feel great. How funny's Pat? - Yeah. - Yeah. Like, really weird but cute. - Yeah, yeah. - Aw and he's been so nice taking care of me while Damian's such a dick. - Oh yeah, that's nice. - I mean he does work in a chicken shop. - Yeah. - But I feel like he's just never had the right person to encourage him you know? He just needs someone to believe in him. - Oh yeah. - Charlie I think I have a crush on him. - On who? - Pat. - Pat? - Yeah. No I'm lying, I totally fucking like him. - Hi. - Hi. What can I get for you? - Do you have anything vegan? - Probably mash, would probably be the most vegan. - Does it have butter in it? - Yeah and milk I guess. - OK, yeah one mash please. - That'll be $4.20. 80 cents change. - Thank you. - One mash please. - Are you doing anything later? - I'm actually doing yoga with Tanya later on. - Oh that's cool. - Yeah. God she's beautiful. - Yeah. - Just a really amazing person yeah. You know? Real special. - Order number six. - Thanks. I wanna fuck you. - Leave me alone. - I want to fuck you. - More, you're giving us 3%, we wanna see 3000! - I want to fuck you. I want to-- - OK stop, please stop! Charlie what the fuck are you doing? - What you asked me to do. - No I mean what the fuck are you doing here Charlie? What is the fucking point of spending however much you're spending on these classes coming here every week wasting our fucking time if you can't even convince us that you're a human being, is there anything even fucking in there? Why are you here Charlie? - Because I love acting, it's what I wanna do. - Charlie I've been teaching acting for 20 years, I've worked in some fucking terrible places with some fucking bad actors but out of all the fucked up deluded students I have ever come across you are by far the fucking worst. I don't think you want to act, no. I think you want to hide for some fucked up, fucking weird reason, you don't want anyone to see what's in here, acting is fucking allowing everything of yourself to be seen. It is absolutely and completely the one thing that I doubt very much you have ever even come to close to experiencing in your fucking subpar mouse-like fucking boring life and that is being real, you are not fucking real Charlie, you're not even a fucking person, you're a fucking mouse. Nobody wants to watch a mouse, people fucking hate mice, people fucking kill mice, people stick fucking test tubes in mice, now do it again! - I wanna fuck you. - How fucking dare you? How dare you not be real with us, we're being real with you, Damian is being real, Pete is being very fucking real, last week in his masturbation scene, you think it's fair? You think it's fair that we reveal everything? We are real with you and you give us this fucking mouse shit. Again! - I wanna fuck-- - No, fuck, again! - I wanna fuck you. - Scream it. - I wanna fuck-- - I wanna fuck you! I wanna fuck you. I wanna fuck you. I wanna fuck you! I wanna fuck you. I wanna fuck you. I want to fuck you, I want to fuck you, I wanna fuck you. Fuck you! - Excuse me, do you know where room 309 is? - Ah yeah, it's just the first one down here on the right. - Thank you. - I'll just touch you there, so it's painful there? - Yeah. - And how about on the other side? OK so painful there as well? OK, I'm just gonna look at your arm, just put your arm down for me. Alright, so the arms hurting too? - Un huh! Oh God. - (Nurse) It's alright, try to relax, OK. - Oh my God Charlie, oh! - Are you OK? What happened? - I'm in love. I mean I fainted in yoga and I hit my head but I'm in love. - (Nurse) Tanya I'm just gonna look at your-- OK, alright, so your ribs are painful as well? OK, that's alright, just relax again for a minute. - Who are you-- - Pat. - Pat? - Oh my God Charlie, it's so nice we talk about everything, we were so crazily connected. - OK, I'm just gonna look at your tummy-- Oh OK. So it's pretty much painful everywhere I'm touching you isn't it? OK, I'm just gonna have a chat to your doctors, just try to relax for me for a bit, OK? - Oh my God I love you. - Are you gonna be OK? - Yeah, I'm not allowed to workout on an empty stomach and do a double yoga and park but yeah. Oh mate, I have a fucking black belt OK? But alright. Oh my God, guys it's my ad, turn it up! - I hate when he has bad breath, ew. That's why I feed him Dog Bites, the nutritional blend of bone, vegetable and meat and shows that he gets everything he needs without the nasty smell. Thank you Dog Bites. - Ah, I look good. - Thank you. - Here, drink that. - Oh. Charlie? Thank you. - What are you doing? - I'm just having some mash. How are you feeling? Are you feeling better? - What's wrong? - I'm kind of sad. - Is it Damian? - No. It's Pat. - Pat? - I like Pat. I thought he was into me. I thought we had, you know, I thought he was giving me signals. But I think he's into you now and, um... And you like him and that's nice. That's really nice. I'm just a bit disappointed, but I'll get over it. I just was a bit disappointed, that's all. You should keep resting. - Yeah. - Tanya? Where are you going nurse said that you have to -- - To Pat's. - Cool. Are you guys gonna hang out or something? - Yeah, hang out. Maybe we'll fuck a bit. - Hey. - Hey. - Is everything OK? - Yes. I just wanted to tell you really quickly, just in case there's been any kind of miscommunication, I like you and I think our connection is really unique and nice, and I'm aware that you might be into Tanya. But I just wanted to make sure that you knew that I like you That's it. I might just hide behind this wall here. Just until you and Tanya go inside. Just because I didn't tell her I was coming and I find her a bit scary. Cool! Thank you. - Hey. That's for being a dickhead to my best friend. And the second one is for working at a fucking chicken shop instead of following your dreams. And Charlie, look. Charlie, I know I can be self-absorbed. I know that. Everyone knows that. I can't fucking help it, but even if I could, I can't read your mind. Charlie, you actually there? - I'm sorry, Tanya. - No, don't apologise. It's so confusing when you apologise. How am I supposed to know I'm being a bitch if you're apologising all the time and making it seem like it's your fault? - I should have told you. I almost told you but then he went kind of cold and I was embarrassed. - Why would you be embarrassed in front of me? - I'm always embarrassed in front of you. - What? - You're so cool. And you're always yourself and you don't care what anyone thinks. I don't know, you're like this cool opposite version of me. - I'm not cool. I stole your boyfriend. Why the fuck would you even wanna be friends with me? - It wasn't that bad. And I didn't wanna lose you. I love being around you. You're so positive and happy. - I'm not happy, I'm not happy. I'm never gonna be happy. I put myself before everyone else. I know I'm never gonna be happy. - Tanya, that's not true. - Name one time I haven't put myself first. - All the time. You're always doing things for me. You're so generous. - It's because that's in my nature. I'm extremely generous. When have I ever gone against my nature to do something for someone else? - Right now. I know you like Pat and you could be with him if you wanted to, but you're choosing not to for me. - Well, it's the first time. - You volunteer at the soup kitchen. - Yeah, that is true. And it is really hard. It's straight after my voice class. - It was nice to see you both. - You can fuck off, mate. No, you need to give Charlie an explanation. - That's OK. You can just text me, maybe? - No, it's easy. Do you like her or are you just a dickhead? - I guess I'm just a dickhead. I didn't mean to lead you on. If that's what you thought, I'm sorry. - Ah that's OK. - Bullshit. You told her you like her. - Oh, actually he never said that. - OK, well, you fucking, what did he do? - Just a few signals like, eye contact and some smiles, but I might have misread it. - No, you definitely didn't misread it. You're very good at reading things. Why did you give her signals? - I'm just gonna go, but thank you. - Why can't you just answer her? - I've gotta go. I'm sorry. Please. - Hey, there you are. Sorry to interrupt. I made dinner, so if... - This is Charlie. This is Tanya. This is Jane. - Hey, nice to meet you. - My wife. - Hey, it's really nice to meet you. - Pat said so much about you both. - That's funny, because he never fucking mentioned you. - Oh. I made dinner if you guys - Yeah. - No, we actually have to go. Thanks it was nice to meet you. - (Toddler) Mommy. Mommy, mommy. - (Jane) Hey. Say hello to daddy's friends. You're ready for dinner? - We actually really have to go. - See you later, guys. - See you. - (Jane) Say bye-bye. - Fuck. - Fuck. - Fuck. - Fuck. - Fuck. - Fuck. - (Charlie) Fuck. - Fuck. - Fuck. - Charlie, what's happening here? Are you feeling anything at all? - Yeah. - And are you investing that into what you're saying? - Yeah. - Where are you feeling it? Show me. - Here. - Does it feel big? - Yeah. - And when you open your mouth to speak, does it come out? - No. Should it? - Yeah, that's kind of the whole point of acting, yeah. But anyway, why doesn't it come out? - Because there's all these people watching, and I don't want them to see it. - OK. Well, I don't know why you'd think you want to be an actor. But OK, we can work with that. Look at Damian. (Greg) Do you feel anything? - Yeah. - (Greg) What is it? - Well, I know that we were never really in love, but I always thought what we had was so special, because we were always so honest to each other, and good to each other. And I don't care that you liked someone else, but I don't understand why you didn't tell me about it. You just made me feel really stupid and like I'm not cool and chill when, really, I think I am pretty cool and chill. - OK, I meant the character, but that's great. So, tell him all that again, with "Fuck you." - Fuck you. - (Greg) C'mon, he didn't take you seriously. - Fuck you. - He didn't treat you like you were cool and chill Show him you are a cool, you are chill. - Fuck you. - OK, Damian, your line. - Yeah. Leave me alone. - Fuck you. - Here it is. Now we must get to work. We must do something, or I will not be able to endure it. - Fuck you. - Leave me alone. - I want to fuck you. - I want to fuck you. - Now, the line from the script. - Shit, I can't remember it. - Stay in it, stay in it! Don't lose it! - "Give it up." "Why do you want to frighten us?" - Give it up. Why do you want to frighten us? - "Give it up, Uncle Vanya." "My misfortune is perhaps"-- - Give it up, Uncle Vanya. My misfortune is perhaps even greater than yours, yet I am not plunged in despair. I endure my sorrow, Uncle Vanya, and I shall continue to endure it until the day my life comes to a natural end. And you must endure yours. You must endure your sorrow, Uncle Vanya. You must endure it. - What is with you? - The guy I liked is married with a child. - Oh, fuck. - Yeah, fuck. - Fuck. - Fuck. - Thank fucking Christ. Thank fucking Christ, he's married with a kid. What do you want, Charlie? Tell me, what does Charlie want? - To fuck him, and to kill him? Love and commitment is what you want, isn't it? Love and commitment. - Yeah. - And to be fulfilled and to feel like OK about the fact that you're going to die one day. - Yep. - Well, that's fuckin' insane. There's not a single person, not one thing in this entire universe that can do that for you. Damian cannot do it. - It's not Damian. - Sure, you would've felt good and all that. Got married, had a kid, all that. But then one day, you look into his eyes, and ask yourself, "Who the fuck is that?" You realise that you don't know him at all. He's a complete fuckin' stranger. This whole fulfilment is just something you've constructed so as not to kill yourself, and to perpetuate the population of the species. Every single person on the planet is separate to you, even your Damian. No matter how many times you try to become one by fucking fucking with each other, you can never become one. He can't give you anything. You are alone. Separate. Completely alone, and you're going to die. - Thanks, Greg. - Thank fucking God, he's married with a baby, because now, you are going to have to either do the one thing that you can absolutely depend upon to stop you from killing yourself, or you'll have to kill yourself. Both of those options are better than seeking validation from any fuckin' Damian. - It's...It's not Damian. Damian doesn't have a kid. - The one thing that no one can take away from you. The one thing that is yours, regardless of any other people. You're going to have to act, Charlie. I'm miserable as fuck. I'm poor. I can't even go home with my dying mother. Half my friends are dead. I'm lonely, and I have to teach you a bunch of And all you want is fame and validation. But, hey, occasionally, I get to act, so I don't kill myself. - Oh. - C'mon, Greg. - Oh, fuck. - Oh, God, sorry, man. - Sorry, dude. - Thank you. - No worries, saw that one coming. - Oh, no, no. No, get him off. Get him off. - Come on, I'm here. - He had this little baby that was so cute. - Yeah, Jim. - What? - Jim, that's his name. - Jim? - Yeah. - Wait, like Jim for James, or Jim for J--? - I don't know. I didn't listen to him when -- Oh, God, how's is wife though? - Oh, she was really sweet. - She wasn't that good in uni. - Hey! - Pat. - Oh, my God, it's the fuckin' chicken shop. I know this chicken shop! - Hey, boy! - Oh, my God, that's your boss, that little awful thing! - Hey, boy, where you go? - What did she say? - Where you go? - She calls you "Boy"? - Boy, come back! - She calls you "Boy"? - Stupido. - She doesn't even know your fuckin' name! - What was that, Miss? - Tell him, come back! - We can't really hear you. Can you scream louder? - (Yelling Woman) Hey, boy! - Me? You talkin' You talkin' to me? - Not you! You! This boy! Come back inside! - Would I like chicken? Yes, yes. And some chips. - I fire him! I fire him! - Yeah, we should go, we should go, we should go! Oh, say hi to your wife and child for me. It was so lovely to finally meet them. - Hey, stupid! Boy, come back inside! Do not just stand there "Oh it's a nice night" Come on! Come on, boy! You want to job? or you no want job? Boy! - Inside! Come and finish your job inside! Hello? Hello? Oh, thank you very much! Thank you. Come on.
