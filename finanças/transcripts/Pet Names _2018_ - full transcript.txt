Oh, oh, gotta get movin'. You two enjoy your little slice of heaven. - Thank you. - Thank you. Oh. Hi. You know I forgot that you do that. Do what? You know how you always try and strike up conversations with strangers. Oh yeah. I mean we're all human right. Yeah I guess. I just forgot that you do that. You know our site's in the lower loop, right. Yeah, I'm just trying to remember if we forgot anything. Okay. Can you drive forward while you do that? Yeah. That's better. No, no, don't help. - I'm going to. - Okay. And just like that. Okay, I don't know how to do this. And then disengage the rain fly pole, which we did. Mm hm. First pull out of the sleeve, You're talking, you're looking at removing it. Oh disassemble. That's the disassemble. I know I know. What are you doing? I'm trying to see if Tinder works out here. Woof. It's for the game. It's for the purposes of the game. Oh yeah, for sure dude, - for sure. - Yeah. No? - Uh uh. - Nothing. Okay. Did you see this Bigfoot sticker though? That's really good. Have you seen him? Have you seen him? I've seen the Lord. All right, no bonfire. So how do you want to do this? Um? I want to sleep for a very long time? No, I mean, like I can sleep in the car if you want or? Oh no, no, don't be dumb. Okay. Yeah, that would have sucked so. Groovy. So how long ago was that? Uh, a few months ago, like five, maybe. Damn, that sucks man. Yeah, you know, I wished she'd left me for a dude or something, like not a corporation. Mm hm. 'Cause that just means that I was less entertaining to her that some like, boring nine to five job, a Christmas bonus, you know. I mean, that's like, not what it was though right? No, what do you mean? Like you can't blame somebody for wanting to pursue their calling or whatever. Yeah. Mm, maybe it was just bad timing. Or maybe she was using it as an excuse. Yeah maybe. No, that's really what I think it was. Does it matter? I guess not, but. It doesn't. It's hard either way, it doesn't matter. Sure, yeah, but, okay. But if she'd left me for a guy, I could beat him up. Or, if she was like exploring her sexuality, Come on Cameron, come on. Or whatever like, I could lie and say we hella threesomes but you know, it's not like I'm gonna stop using Google as a peaceful protest, whatever. Okay. I just don't really know what to do when that happens. You know, like, I'm just supposed to go back to like normal life? Uh, yeah okay, this is done now. Know where to put it. What? The pain dude, the pain. Catch! You coming? I want to say yeah, but isn't that weird? On the contrary my dear. I've seen your jubblies, I've see your puss so many times, it's like wallpaper now. I won't even notice it. I've always wanted a man to say that to me. - Sexy wallpaper. - Mm hm, that's better. Come on! Live for the thrill! Gotta? - No. - No? I'm gonna let you have this one. Okay. Enjoy the view. Yep, there he is. Oh Jesus Cam. Yes. I honestly. What? You always think you have such a great ass and it's really, I do though! No you don't. It's the perfect proportions.

We're doing this now, is that what we're doing. When I was a little kid, and my family would go camping, my Dad before bed would tell me and my brother these stories about these two kids on this planet called Toasteron. Yeah, it was really just my brother and me, and they'd get into all kinds of trouble you know, but like Indiana Jones type of trouble. Like they'd always end up okay. And I used to pretend that I couldn't sleep to have him keep telling stories. I used to do that with you. When you'd scratch my back. - Really? - Yeah. 'Cause you were so good at it and I liked it so much, I'd just lie and say I wasn't tired. Do you want me to scratch your back right now, is that why you're bringing this up? - No. - Are you sure? - No. - Okay, turn around. Sorry. So I think I might have redemption for our game? Hm? Some girl at another campsite just checked me out. You sure she was checking you out? Like 100% sure. Like bone zone. All right, show me what she did. Okay, she was like. Ah, hi. Like that. Was she cute? Hello? I'm not shallow. Come on. Okay, yeah she was pretty insanely hot. All right, good job. Okay, do I get a point or? Okay, yes, you get 1,000 points okay. Okay, well how many did you get for rest stop girl? 1,000 too. I'm gonna go walk Goose. Hi, you've reached Laurie, I can't come to the phone right now but if you leave a brief message after the beep, I will call you right back. Thanks, have a good day, bye. Hey, it's me, I'm sorry that I missed your call. I was not looking at my phone which is the point of camping, I guess. Um, what else do you want to know. The fire still looks the same. Camping is still, you know, the same thing. Anyway, love you. I hope you're sleeping right now. Love you bye. Where the fuck did you go, his hips are really bad, you can't walk him for that long. Okay, relax, I carried his fat ass half the time. I didn't know you guys were going on like an actual hike. Sorry, should have been more clear. What's up dude? Are you still with that guy? Who Davis? What, no! Ew. Did you hook up with Davis? No. 'Cause that'd be, ew. No, no, the one guy, the other guy, furniture guy. - P.T. - P.T. Yeah, uh, kind of, I guess, you know. I don't really know, it's like a lite thing, you know. L-I-T-E, relationship lite. You cool? I don't know if you had to call him, or something. I was texting my Mom. You know, he seemed really nice, when I saw you guys at the Kingfish. Very stately. - Right? - Yeah. Like he could for sure be a politician if he wasn't such an artist. Why do you do that? What? You make fun of people for caring about things, for being driven. I don't know. Probably 'cause I'm not anymore. What's the plan, for the rest of the day? I don't have one. If you were up here alone, what would you be doing? Searching for my soul. No way. Yeah, Dre had some left over from Burning Man, so they gave it to me. Let's go! - Right now? - Right now, yeah. - Right now. - Right now. Okay. What about Goose? He'll, nah, he'll be fine. Right? Why are you asking me, he's your dog!
