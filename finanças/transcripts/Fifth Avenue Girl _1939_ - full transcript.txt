That's beside the point. We've been through all that. All I know is we're facing bankruptcy. I spent a week going through factory talking to the men. None of them want to strike. If they can help it. That's true, isn't it Joe? They don't want to but they have to unless the unions get together. There. Stanton's outfit won't put one over on us. If you think we're putting one over on you, put it to a vote. We were there before you. - You'd get licked. That's what you think. You force us into a closed shop. Your contract with us stops that. We granted you the 44-hour week. What else do you want? That's the trouble. Stanton's group also wants a 44-hour week. That's right. - Will that ruin us? If you do that we must return to the old wage scale. We won't stand for that. We can't stand a half million dollar loss or we'll have no operating capital. That's not our business. You made half a million the year before. The government took most of that in taxes. Look, gentlemen. All Mr Borden wants is to keep the factory running. Some men have been with him for years. He wants to keep them working. We need money to operate or we're sunk. - What will we use for money? There isn't much surplus. - Suppose we float a bond issue? The FCC will stop that. - If they don't, the stockholders will. Gentlemen, I am tired and bewildered. The X-Y-Z. I've had enough for one day. If you don't mind, let's get together next week. I'll put a report before the committee. I don't think it will get any place. Don't think we are trying to run your business, Mr Borden. You don't want to run my business. You won't let me run it. So .. Good day, gentlemen. So long, Joe. Tell the boys we'll try to keep going somehow. I don't know just how but we'll figure a way out. How's the missus? - Fine, Tim. The kids finish school next week. We're going on a fishing trip. Give them my best. - Thanks. Anything else before I leave? Can you stand some more bad news? - Go ahead. The tax board turned down our appeal for a 1936 refund. That is cheering. It's a good thing we still have the Hershey account. Have their contracts come through? Your son attends to that. A safe account. Anyone can handle it. We've had it for twenty years. We haven't got it now. - What? What did you say? They asked for a new estimate. Your son was away. They took the account to Acme. Why didn't you do something about this? - You told us to lay off. Is my son here now? - He's not been here all week. He's been playing polo. International finals or something. Polo? That's all for today, gentlemen. My nerves are beginning to snap. I think I'll get along home. Miss Watson, is my car here? - Yes it is. Thanks. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight. May I see you a minute? - If it's about Amalgamated Pump, no. It's to do with your birthday. Just a little remembrance. This is very sweet of you. Do you mind if I open it? If you like. - This is very charming. It isn't much. - It is very nice. Well, that's one bright spot in a gloomy day. I hope it's not too loud. - No. I didn't mean it that way. No. It's really very conservative and I appreciate it very much. Goodnight. Well, Michael. There seems to be a touch of spring in the air. Yes, sir. That's something even the poor people can enjoy. Happy birthday to me. Good evening, Higgins. - Good evening. You're home early. A man ought to get home early at least one day a year. Yes, sir. He should. I suppose the family will be in to dinner? But I'm not expecting them, sir. - You mean, nobody? Mrs Borden is dining out. Your daughter is going to the Wanda Frisbee coming-out party. She wants the car. I haven't heard from Mr junior. - I know about him. He is settling an important problem in polo. Aren't you feeling well, sir? - Yes. I guess I am alright. Perhaps it's a touch of spring fever? - Perhaps. I felt it myself this afternoon just walking in the park. What park? Central Park, sir. - Oh yes. I forgot it was there. And there's a special letter for you. You should have been in the park today. Some of the flowers were out. The maple trees have begun to burgeon. - The what? Burgeon. Develop. It's fun watching nature come to life. - Is it? I enjoy it. You can actually see the buds budding? - Well, almost. You don't mean they go 'snap' in your face like popcorn? No. You go there often? - Whenever I am free. Some people like to watch the animals. Other people like to row on the lake. But I like the trees and flowers. Well, I guess they're nice if you like them. Is it bad news, sir? Are you sure you're feeling alright, sir? Sit down, Higgins. - Yes, sir. Is there anything wrong with me? - No, sir. Not that I know of, sir. I don't frighten people, do I? - Not at all. I don't suppose my family is frightened of me? No. - Sit down. Higgins. I wonder why people work as hard as they do. And for what? I often wonder myself, sir. You've wondered too? - Yes, sir. After all, what do they get out of life? - That's right. What do they get? Sit down. - I feel very uncomfortable. Sit down anyway, You make me uncomfortable. So, you are happy just looking at trees and flowers? No. Not entirely, sir. I find my work here very pleasant. - Why? You want me to be frank, sir? - By all means. To be frank, sir. We servants enjoy the luxuries of wealth but have none of the responsibilities. I see. Higgins, what was the name of the tree you told me about over in the park? The maple, sir. There are several by the seal pond. What's he looking at? - Never mind. Come on. Maybe there's a squirrel up there. - You've seen enough animals already. Notice the fins on that one. You know the origins of that? Centuries ago those were hands. The hands were turned back to fins by nature. For the water. Constantly in the water. Over the years. Funny looking animals. Maybe we look funny to them too. Yes. I suppose we do. Don't get the seals wrong, lady. They're more intelligent than most carnivores. Except the dog. - Is that so? Anyhow, they seem to be having a nice time. I can't imagine it's much fun swimming around all day in a fur coat. You're wrong again, lady. These ain't fur seals at all. They ain't? - A different genus entirely. What will happen next? - See that one? It's a male. Know how I can tell? He's bigger than the female. - Or the female is smaller. That's right. And lighter in color. I see. Males are darker. And louder. Commercial seals are found in vast numbers on certain islands. And their barking is described as forming an incessant din. The things I never knew until now. He looks hungry. Maybe he can stand a cookie. He won't eat that, lady. They subsist on fish and crustaceans of which they consume an enormous quantity. You got a herring in your pocket? I am sorry. I came entirely unprepared. I'm glad he told me all this. At least, it's nice to know how the other half lives. Thanks very much. - You are welcome, madam. I couldn't say while the lady was here but the ordinary or hairless seals. They should be monogamous. But walruses and other kinds of seals are polygamous. That's fine. - Very few people know that. I'm glad to learn it. It is interesting. Have you got something for the pigeons? - Coming right up. One? Two? Two. Twenty cents. - That's alright. Mind if I sit down here? It's a public bench. Our acquaintance at the fish pond seems to have a profound knowledge of seals. The pigeons are friendly little creatures. They're just hungry. I used to have a whole flock of them when I was a kid. Harriers and pigeons. I even had a couple of tumblers too. They are very amusing. They have no equilibrium. That is too bad. Say, you don't think that I followed you over here? Why should you? What are you, a flatfoot? You mean a detective? No, no. If you are, I haven't done anything. Do I look like one? - You might be. Have you ever heard of Amalgamated Pump? What kind of pump? - Amalgamated Pump. I don't know why I should bring that up. A rather unwelcome thought at present. Why talk about it then? That's right. Why talk about it? I've heard enough about seals too. I might just as well be frank. I did follow you over here. I was lonely. You talked to me over there. You see, it's my birthday. Birthdays are alright but you never get over the first one. Aren't you afraid to spoil your dinner? This is my dinner. You're on a diet? Yes. But against my wishes. That scarcely seems sufficient. I could jump in the seal pond. Somebody might throw me a fish. Haven't you got a job? Who has? It doesn't seem to worry you very much. It doesn't. I'm alive and kicking. I have 5 dollars in my pocket book. My rent is paid for another week. And after that? I don't know. Something will turn up. It usually does. Yes. But suppose that it doesn't? There's always the park. You mean you would sleep in the park? What's wrong with that? You mean that wouldn't worry you? You sound like one of those Fifth Avenue cadavers. Avenue what? Those people that live over there. Millionaires. How do they sound? They're always squawking. You'd think the country was going to the dogs. Well, they've got their problems too. What problems? I used to stand in the plaza at night and watch them go home. They look like a lot of wax dummies who have eaten an overdose of sour pickles. Aren't you being just a little bit severe? They make me tired. I don't like them either. Say, I've got an idea. You see, this is my birthday. It's not mine. Would I be presuming if I suggested you help me celebrate my birthday? Do what? We could .. Go someplace and eat. Where? The Flamingo Club. The Flamingo? You mean that very elegant caf? over on .. People must have a wonderful time there. It costs so much. You're sure? No. I mean it. I'd love to go. So would I. I'd as soon go to the automat and keep the change. But this is my birthday. We could have lots of fun insulting the rich. Sure you won't run out and leave me the check? No. I've got money. Lots of money. Last time I went with a stranger he went to the phone and I never saw him again. Here. You can hold it. I don't want you to think .. No, no. Not at all. Shouldn't you get someone to hold me? No. I think you'll be alright. Fine. Swell. Let's eat. If I eat any real food I'd probably die. I'd just as soon die of food poisoning as anything else. Mister, why do they look at the tree? I don't know. Been here five minutes myself and can't see anything. I don't know. A couple of stiffs. Good evening. Have you a reservation? How about those tables? - They're reserved, madam. If you wait at the bar .. - We want something to eat. I am sorry, sir. Nothing just now. Good evening, Pierre. - Evening, Mr Pates. Anything up front? Yes, sir. I saved a nice table for you. - Thank you. A nice table for us up front. We should go home and put on our Sunday suits. I suggest you give him ten dollars. For what? It seemed to work with that other fellow. It's your money. What do you do, print this stuff? Do we get a table? - Thank you, madam. I think I can arrange it. He nearly took my arm with it. We just got a cancellation on number 4. Good. Good. Come this way please. You know, you're very lucky. You're getting one of our best tables. A ringside table. I wish you knew what this was doing to my scotch blood. We should be able to take the table and chairs home with us. And throw in some silverware. There seems to be a lot of your rich cadavers here tonight. They look like they're dressed for a wake. Is it satisfactory, sir? - This is fine. Look. We want the best of everything. This is my birthday. My compliments, sir. The wine list? What would you like as a refreshment? How much does it cost? - We will not worry about that. May I suggest Mont?re 1928? What's that over there? - This is Cheviot 1926. Would you like some? - I'm afraid it's too expensive. This is my birthday. Better bring some for everybody. You mean everybody here, sir? - No. He was just joking. No, I am not. Let's make this a real celebration. If you're fool enough to spend it, I'm smart enough to help. Sir, there are quite a few people here. Don't worry. We've got money. I didn't mean to question you, madam. - No. But that's what you meant. That only goes for those in here now. Newcomers are out. Most certainly, madam. I'll tell him off later on. - There is lots of time. You should never insult anyone on an empty stomach. It is very good. It is good, isn't it. It mixes very well with apples. - Have some more. Why not? When I take a sip of this, it's like drinking six pairs of silk stockings. You can't drink silk stockings. Is this just your birthday or has Christmas sneaked up on me too? It is my birthday and we are going to have a good time. You're telling me. What about the fifteen million unemployed? My dear, what can we do about it? We're sunk no matter how we try. It's a question of either too much government interference in business. Or too much business interference in government. Wall Street speaks. Hey, you. Lay off the government. I beg your pardon? She's cockeyed. Pipe down, d?butante. A civil war d?butante. Everything alright, madam? - Tell her to lay off the government. Please, madam. If you hit him on the back, bats may fly out of his mustache. Those people annoy me. - They annoy me too. 'Annoy me too'? Who do they annoy, you or me? I guess both of us. - That's fine. Let's dance. Fine. Let's dance. What is that? We didn't order champagne. Compliments from the old gentleman over there, sir. It is his birthday or something. Happy to help him celebrate. - How sweet. Which one is it? Over there, madame. What is the trouble? Nothing. Nothing. Who were you waving at? - Just a friend of mine. Excuse me. I'll be right back. Who is paying for all this? - It's this gentleman's birthday. Who is buying? - The gentleman there. What are you doing here? - Celebrating my birthday. Please sit down. You are conspicuous. I'll only be a minute. I want to meet the gentleman. Hopkins. My husband. I read about you in the papers. - Don't be a bore. Congratulations. I think you show very good taste. More than I'll say for you. If you want to join us later we are really going to have some fun. I wish you were with me. There was a fellow I wanted to insult but I couldn't think of anything to say. I don't know what it is but now I'm beginning to like everybody. Including him. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, Mr Borden. Good morning. - Good morning, my dear. Are you in a mood to discuss some matters of importance to both of us? I'd rather not. You see, there are some things that need my attention. Yes. I can imagine that. Your eye is one of them. - I happened to have a little accident. The paper gives a full account of it. Yesterday was my birthday. Is that any excuse for brawling in a nightclub? What's come over you? How do you expect me to face my friends after this disgraceful episode? Who was that woman? - What woman? Who was she? - She's a nice girl. I met her in the park. - She must be a nice girl. I don't see why you have to make such a fuss over an innocent celebration. That's your idea of innocence? How long have you known her? - You mean Miss Grey? I can explain that very simply. It was my birthday. - You already reminded me of that. I was lonely. I met her in the park. I never saw her before in my life. And I'll probably never see her again. Good morning. I'm glad you are still here. I was afraid I had overslept. Miss Grey, this is my wife. Mrs Borden. - I'm glad to meet you. Where did you come from? - From upstairs. I know. But how did you get upstairs? - Don't you remember? In a way I do. But in a way I don't. Was Mrs Borden upset about something? - Apparently she was. She isn't angry at me? I think she's angry at both of us. I suggest I'd better be leaving. No. For heaven sakes don't leave me now. I can't think of a better time. I'm not only curious about how you got here. I'm curious to learn how I got here. It's a little vague to me. Perhaps Higgins could help us out. I don't see how I can walk into this place and not see it. It has an odd effect on one. The less you see of it the better you like it. I see plenty. Higgins. Were you awake when we came in last night? I was most thoroughly awake, sir. Look. He's got one too. Only much prettier colors than yours. - I must apologize for my appearance. Where did you get yours, Higgins? Never mind. Better get us breakfast. I had a beautiful evening being out in society. I have a wonderful headache. I can't be happier but I must run along. You must have some breakfast. Besides, I need your advice. My advice to me is to leave while I'm still in one piece. Sit here. You must have a large family. - I'm afraid I haven't any family. However, I did have a birthday. If I don't have another for 10 years .. It will be soon enough. - But we had a wonderful time. But I spent a dollar of my own money. - You shouldn't have done that. That argument with the taxi driver. Remember the taxi driver? - I'll never forget. If I don't seem too inquisitive, what's this about a taxi driver? Not as belligerent than the policeman. - Policeman? He calmed down when you told him you'd defend Miss America with your life. Who? - Miss America. Did anything else happen? - No. You were very quiet after you fell down the stairs. You requested we put Miss America in the guest room. Miss America? Did somebody else come home with us? - No. I'm Miss America. Sorry, Higgins, if I caused you any embarrassment. Not at all, sir. It was nice to see you happy for a change. I don't mind the discoloration at all, sir. That was last night anyway. But something happened this morning that hasn't happened in a long time. This is the first time in years that my wife paid any attention to me. I think you had something to do with it. I imagine I did. You said something would turn up. Well, here it is. Now, why not take a job with me? What kind of job? - We'll find something. I know you don't like the rich. I am not a capitalist. I'm a victim of the capitalistic system. Alright. I never wanted all this. Why is it my fault that I invented a pump? All I wanted out of life was to have some fun and a family. I haven't got a family and I haven't had any fun. Until last night. Right this way. The size of the place. Katherine, do people really live here? It looks like Buckingham Palace. We won't get thrown out? - I don't think so. How about a drink? I'm cold. Where do you keep the alcohol? You did jump in the swimming pool. - I didn't jump. I was pushed. Alright. We'll dry you out. We have to take his clothes off to dry him out. There are people here. Just my father and somebody. He was chasing goldfish. What will your father think? - Nobody pays attention to dad. Don't mind me, Skippy. Just make yourself at home. I'll dry these things. Did you enjoy the goldfish? - Not very much. I bet you did some screwy things when you were in college. I ate a bowl of live eels once. Can you imagine that? Fifty thousand dollars for one d?but. Fifty thousand to introduce one nitwit into a society of nitwits. Were you talking about Wanda? - Not really. We all think Wanda is a nitwit. Can you dry these out and fix them? I don't know about pressing pants. - You'll learn. And this too please. Of all the things. Michael. Would you mind getting me a cup of Champagne? This is my breakfast hour. I am supposed to be eating now. Please sit down. I'm just a puppet. I shouldn't sit in the presence of .. I know. You shouldn't sit in the presence of capitalistic scum. I didn't say that. - You were thinking it. I should not think. I'm supposed to wait outside a hotel all night. As capitalists get drunk and fall in a swimming pool. Don't talk so much, Michael. Sit down and eat your eggs. He's always using them big words. You'll feel better after some sleep. I am not supposed to sleep. Just wind me up like a mechanical toy. I didn't mean to be rude. The rich can afford to be rude. Never mind. One day a Samson of the proletariat will arise .. To lean on the columns of this temple and the walls will come tumbling down. Michael, you're wonderful. Michael talks too much. I like to hear Michael talk. - Here. Guzzle yourself. These aren't for me. It's medicine for Skippy. He swallowed some goldfish. - Medicine? Do you know there are 40 million people in the USA? This land of opportunity. Whose annual income is less than 12 cases of that. 78 percent of the population have less than 25 cases. And 67 percent of the 78 percent .. Cannot afford medicine without depriving themselves of the necessities of life. Thank you, Michael. I'll try and remember that. Come gang. Look what I got. - What will you do with that? I'll give it to Skippy in case his goldfish are still floating around. We can go up to my room. We'll take the elevator. Right here. Does this go on all the time? That gives you an idea of the effect of unemployment among the upper classes. The office is calling, sir. Hang the office. - I'd better go. Don't you go. Don't you go. I'll be right back. Hello, mum. What's up? - Read this. Second column. Have you heard any rumors about your father lately? I've heard rumors alright but not about father. That's an unnecessary remark. This must have been some shindig. I'm sorry I missed it. Is he banged up much? - Just a common black eye. It's not funny. You've not heard the worst. Who's this blond woman? - That's what I'm coming to. She spent the night here. - You're kidding. She spent the night in the guest room. Nevertheless, she was here. Go down and get her out. - How do I get her out? You have experience of women. Go down and get her out somehow. I'll do the best I can. She might poke me in the eye. Tell your father I want to see him in the study at once. Good morning. - Morning. I'm Mr Borden's son. Your father told me about you. - Let's get to the point. How long have you known father? A long time. Ever since last night. You only met him last night? - In the park. A pick up? Nothing as vulgar as that. What would you call it? - Love at first sight, I guess. Don't make me laugh, lady. My father's an old man. Age doesn't matter when the real thing happens. How about money? Does it matter? - It helps. Now we're getting somewhere. Look. You know what that is? A fifty-dollar bill. Exactly what it is. Yep. It's the real thing. I can see the veins running through it. I bet you the fifty you can't get out the front door before I count to ten. That's pretty far. - I could count up to twenty. I doubt I could make it. You see, my rheumatism has bothered me lately. I understand you play polo? - Yeah. What has that to do with it? - Nothing. Just that I'm amazed. Amazed at what? Amazed to find that horses have better breeding than the people who ride them. Have you talked the matter over? Yes. I've had a couple of propositions. Of the two, I like yours the best. Good. We'll have you moved in right away. Let's go inside and talk about it. You mean to say she will live here? - Hello. Who won the polo match? Well, there you are. A report on the state of the business. And I may add, it sounds rather ominous. Care to look at it? - No. Reports make me shiver. Tim, you read it. - I don't know about pumps. Your name is on a door at the office. They drove one member of the family out of his mind. And they're not going to get me. Someone has to do something. The business can't go on as it is or the employees may eat up the surplus. When did you speak to him last? - Mr Borden? Wednesday. A week. That was the morning after the night he was taken ill. Yes. He refused to close the factory. He said his employees helped make his fortune. No reason they can't share in it. That proves he's a Red. - That means the end of capitalism. You know what you're saying? - I don't have to know. The end is coming and we must face it. - Sit down. It may not be the end of capitalism. If someone doesn't persuade Mr Borden to take hold again. It will be the end of Amalgamated Pump. Why in heaven's name do men have to pass fifty? Michael says there's no cure for middle age. You're being facetious. - I'm not being facetious. Michael's uncle began cutting up after he was fifty. They should have shot him and Michael too. They didn't. They gave him hot baths and bicarbonate of soda. Stop all this nonsense and quarrelling. I at least expect my family to rally round me in a crisis. Do you think I will humiliate myself and be a virtual prisoner in my own home .. If it were not for you children? - You don't have to be a martyr. I went from hero to zero in a week. Zero suits you fine. For heaven's sake stop that tune. How do you expect me to concentrate? You'll listen to this tune someday and be liking it. Hugo. How nice of you to come. - Hello Martha. How are you? Hello Tim. - Doctor. Terwilliger, I want you to know Dr Kessler. How do you do? Mr Terwilliger is the lawyer of our firm. Dr Kessler is a psychiatrist. Come, Katherine. I think we had better go into the library. Will you come too, Mr Terwilliger? How are things with the business? I think that's what she wants to talk to us about. Tim. Close the door please. I've not been entirely frank with you. Now that Dr Kessler is here .. And since we know you so well. I think you may as well hear the truth. - This sounds rather serious. I scarcely know where to begin. So much has happened. I may as well tell you, there's a woman. - Not a woman, a girl. And attractive. She is not attractive. Not as we understand attractiveness. It seems to me father is just having a good time for a change. Does he show signs of hysteria? No. That's the horrible part of it. He is calm. Terribly calm. And he smiles. And won't talk to any of us. There are times when he seems almost normal. But we can't get near him. That woman follows him around like a poodle. He stays out all night and sleeps most of the day. That makes me crazy too. Hugo. You know Mr Borden is not the kind of man to do anything unconventional. He has stuck to pumps for years. I can't tell you how many. Of course, he is older than I. But it's been for a long time. He is a devoted father. Everything that a wife could ask. Are you sure you do everything a husband could ask? And now. Just at the wrong time he upsets all my plans. After all the sacrifices I have made. Tim, ring for Higgins. Hugo. You may as well know. I have decided to go to Reno. - I see. I can't desert him at a time like this. What would my friends think? What you're afraid they'll think. You stop being flippant while your father is out of balance. I'm sure, Hugo, that you can convince him. That a short time in a nice, quiet sanatorium. Away from that woman. Rest. And proper nourishment. He'll be back in the office in no time. I'll be glad to have a talk with him. Is he in? Did you ring, madam? Is Mr Borden in his room? - No. He's on the roof. Good heavens. He's not going to jump? - Not that I know of. I know he's going to jump. As if we haven't had enough notoriety. You children stay here. I may need you in case of an emergency. Come, Hugo. Don't you need a drink, Mr Terwilliger? No thank you. I think I'll run along. I wish mother would quit acting all over the place. If I were father I'd have jumped ten years ago. How about giving these homers a little extra? When did we fly these here? I had them up early this morning. All ready? Open the throttle. Fly away. Come on. - Let's go. Timothy. Timothy. Timothy, Dr Kessler is here. I thought you may like to see him again. Always glad to see Dr Kessler. This is Miss Grey. Dr Kessler. - How do you do. Is this an old hobby of yours, Mr Borden? Oh yes. We expect to fly with them eventually. Why not? The Wright Brothers did it. - I wouldn't recommend that. I think we can do it with a little application. Don't you, Mary? - I don't see why not. Hugo. I'm afraid Mrs Borden isn't much of a pigeon fancier. I'm afraid not. This looks like fun. Do you mind if I join you? No. Certainly not. Get the pole. We can't get that flock down right now but we can fly these. Ready? How's that? - Let it go. They go. They're off. Dr Kessler has been on the roof a long time. I hope your father isn't becoming violent. Imagine father getting violent. I don't know what has descended on this household. Even those pigeons up there are insane. Here is Dr Kessler now. Hugo. You need not be afraid to say it. - There isn't much to say. Nothing is wrong with your husband. Nothing wrong? - No. He's perfectly normal. Doctor Kessler. You mean to say that a man who neglects his business .. To wave a stick at pigeons is normal? As a matter of fact, Martha, I think you need a little professional consultation. I? You mean to imply that I am neurotic? - No, no. It's that you've let yourself get upset over nothing. Nothing? I thought you were a competent man. I recommend you to friends. I have patients waiting at the office. I'll drop by in a few days. Did you hear what he said? Your father isn't out of his mind at all. You sound like you wish he were. Imagine. Flaunting that woman right under my nose. The situation is intolerable. I won't stay another minute. I go to a hotel. Swell. An item in tomorrow's paper will ask what Fifth Avenue matron .. Was run out of her home by a blonde? Matron? - You can't run out. Suppose she marries him? - Why not? She's young and pretty. You imply that I am old and ugly? - What happens to the business? Why don't you do something? You're a bright young thing. If you'd paid attention this wouldn't have happened. Most sons play golf with their fathers. It can't have hurt you. Play golf with a pump handle? If you acted like a daughter instead of running around every night. I am to be a d?butante. The newspaper item on you and Tommy Hopkins started it all. It did not. At any rate, I have a right to lead my own life. I'm not a child. You are old enough to be my mother. Oh. I'm going to faint. I am going to faint. I'm going to have a nervous breakdown. Tim, run and get Dr Kessler. - Alright, mother. Manda. How is mother this morning? - A little better. Dr Kessler is with her now. - That's fine. Did you put these in my room? No, sir. I've not been in your room. - Who has? I don't know, sir. I haven't. If I catch anyone in there who doesn't belong, there's going to be trouble. Are you referring to me? Then you did put them in there? If I want a picture of my father on my dresser I'll ask for it. Sorry. What's wrong with your father? That's beside the point. These reports. You put them there also? I didn't know what else to do. Your father's too ill to work. Bunk. He wasn't too ill two of weeks ago. He seems to think so now. Are you being clever? What is this, the power of suggestion? Somebody must fit in your father's shoes. They're likely too big for you. - I'm not a man. Is that it? You wear long pants. Listen, lady. I want to have a showdown with you. What are you trying to do, disrupt this family? I haven't done anything. - Not much. What is your racket? - I haven't made up my mind yet. Do you think my mother will step aside for you? That's what I've heard. - Well, she's not. I am terribly disappointed. So. You think you'll marry my father. Is that it? I might be your stepmother. I know I'd hate to be your mother. Leave mother out of it. I never said a thing about your mother. - I've just about got you figured. You're a gold-digger. And what is a gold-digger? - You ought to know. You think you're not a gold-digger? What did you do to deserve all this? What have you accomplished? - What do you expect to accomplish? I have my claws in plush and I like the feel of it. If father's business goes to pot there won't be much plush left. Enough for my needs. There you are. We had an accident. The little fellow hurt his foot. It isn't Archie? - It is Eloise. As nearly as I can tell. - Dad. Hello son. - Can I speak to you privately? Ask Miss Grey for an appointment. Do you mind if I speak with my father? - No. Then please go away. Are you two fastened together with wires or something? Dad, you should know that mother is in a pretty nervous condition. Oh? I did not know. That is too bad. I can't criticise you for neglecting mother if you choose to, but .. I criticise your neglect of the business. What business? The pump business. You've seen these reports. I asked Miss Grey to throw them out. - I'm sorry. Stay where you are. - Have you looked them over? I've glanced at them. The situation seems pretty desperate. Why don't you do something about it? - I don't know about the pump business. You can learn. There's nothing to it. Shall we see if we can do something for Eloise? It looks like a sprain to me. Shall I get you some more broth, madam? - No thank you, Manda. Don't forget your pill. - No. Send Michael to me. Yes, madam. Here comes big business. - Shut up. Have a nice time at the office, dear? If anybody mentions the word 'pump' to me again I'll slaughter them. We owe a great deal to pumps. - That office is full of old fogeys. If I don't kick them about it won't be my fault. Importantly, did you sell any pumps? Importantly, you should be quiet. - Please, children. Stop quarrelling. I had a nice, long talk with Dr Kessler. He says we must change our tactics. You cannot catch flies with vinegar. I listened to that kind of double talk all day. What are you trying to say? Dr Kessler says our attitude is all wrong towards this girl. I'd like to grab her neck and throw her out the window. Oh, you big, strong man. - Now, we must all be calm. Dr Keller said if we make father's home attractive to him .. He will forget all about this girl and she will disappear from his psychosis. What is this, black magic? - No. Just psychology. We could have girl-shows in the parlor. That should keep him in nights. Really, Tim. The important thing is we must all change our attitude. We must be very nice to this woman, Miss Grey. So father has nothing to fight against. Do you see? I don't. Can't you vamp her, glamour boy? - Quiet. You can roll those big brown eyes of yours and knock her right off her feet. I'll knock someone else off her feet in one minute. Bickering is no answer to our problem. She wouldn't go out with you anyway. - What have you done to win father over? Hanging around with that dumb ox Michael? You are jealous. You haven't the brains to know what he's talking about. Don't you mean he hasn't the brains to know what he's talking about? What are you two talking about? - Leave Michael alone. Hello Michael. - Come in, Michael. As a matter of curiosity we want to know where Mr Borden goes each evening. I'm a mechanical puppet, not a spy. - What kind of answer is that? You're a paid employee. I have a right. - Does anyone have any rights? Some possibly. The rights to justice and to the fruits of one's own industry. What? We must know what father does at night. The nocturnal meanderings of the upper class don't interest me. You may at least be civil. - Only if civil liberty is in danger. I don't know what you're talking about. You may go. Must I infer you wish me to return this badge of servitude? If you sack Michael I leave this house. No-one said anything about sacking anyone. Go away, Michael. Go back to the garage or something. Thank you for coming. Well now. Where were we? We must be very pleasant to this girl. Then she'll reveal her true colors. Those people always do. Then your father gets rid of her. It's all so simple. Sounds simple to me. - Why so anxious about father? I thought you were going to Reno. Reno will come in time. Tommy Hopkins gave mother the air. - Nothing of the kind. He's being discrete in an emergency. Father mustn't make a fool of himself. We save him from himself. Then we can live our own lives. We must save some of his money for ourselves. Money doesn't enter into it. We must all play our part. I want you to be especially nice to her. You can be charming. I have to go into competition with my old man? You can't even take a girl from your dad. You can make the same sacrifices I make. I make sacrifices going to that office every day. I won't spend evenings with a female I hate. Look at the sacrifices I make. I'm practically a recluse. I see no-one. I gave up all my friends. Or vice versa. - I've had enough from you, young lady. We can only succeed cleverly by unified action. That's what Michael calls a united front. I ask my family to rally round for the last time. Hold it, mother. You look like the statue of liberty. Mr Borden will sit here. Miss Grey will sit next to Mr Timothy. And Miss Katherine sits next to me. Has cook prepared all Mr Borden's favorite dishes? Everything but the beef stew. She hadn't the recipe for that. I didn't know you need a recipe for beef stew. What is the main course? I believe cook has prepared some lovely squab with wild rice. That will be nice. Some lovely what? Squab, madam. Where did you get it? - At the market. You gave me a terrible shock. We couldn't possibly have squab. Mr Borden may be somewhat sensitive. Tell cook to prepare something else. Good evening, Miss Grey. How charming you look. Children, see how lovely Miss Grey looks in her new frock. Please join us in the living room. - Mr Borden waits for me in the car. He's not down yet. We're having an impromptu supper. I thought you both would join us. Timothy, doesn't Miss Grey look charming? Yes. She does. Is that a new gown? - It is. Very chic. Where did you get it? I don't know. That is, I don't remember. - Don't be so inquisitive. Sorry we haven't got to know you better. You're practically one of the family. My illness has upset everything. We're sort-of welcoming mother back from the grave. A ghastly idea. I'm hardly old enough for that. As a matter of fact, we're all a little upset. I apologize if I seem to be rude. - You haven't been that rude. There he is now. I'm sorry I'm late. I was practising the new rumba step. I thought it would be a good idea if you and Miss Grey join us for dinner. For dinner? I'm not quite sure. - All your favorite dishes. Why didn't you let me know? It's sort-of a surprise. - What do you think, Miss Grey? We have a party of friends waiting for us. That is true. Mustn't keep them waiting. - I shouldn't think so. I am sorry. Can we make it some other night? Just as you say, Timothy. - We'd better be getting along. We're a little late now and I don't want to keep them waiting. I think I got that new rumba step now. There goes five million bucks dressed up in tails and we can do nothing about it. Dad looks good when he's decked out. Your father was a handsome young man. That doesn't solve our problem. What do we do now? Send for Dr Kessler. How did you like my rumba? - I think you have something there. It's a shame to go on deceiving my poor family like this. Don't weaken now. It will do them good. - You're the boss. Michael. Just drive through the park again tonight. We'll tell you when we want to go home. Do people get into these things every night and go out into society? Don't ask me. How they can guzzle champagne night after night is more than I understand. I can still feel the effects of your birthday every time I shake my head. Say. The family were being very nice to you when I came down. It nearly scared me to death. They are even nice to me lately. Well. Pretty simple. Take something from someone and they want it more than ever. You have a lot of common sense. - You lost yours but it will come back. You have something more than common sense. You must have common sense on my side of the fence. There's a lot of nice people on your side of the fence. The other fellow's pasture always looks the greener. Does my side of the fence look any different to you now? You can have it. Beginning to feel sorry for the rich, eh? I guess rich people are just poor people with money. I've got to get out of this. [ Singing ] This vicious night life we lead is getting me down. I'm not a very good faker. When I do things I want to mean them. Don't you think I should be getting on my way? I don't ever want to lose you. I should return to where I belong before I get used to this kind of life. You can't walk out on a contract. - It's the goofiest job I've ever had. I don't know what good I'm doing in that house beside getting myself into a mess. Whatever you are doing it seems to work. Why do you want to hang on to a bunch like that? I like them. You really like them? They're a nice sort of family as I remember them. Everybody to his own poison. It's like having an old car. One that you've got used to. You can either junk it or try to salvage it. You're still in love with your wife? Well, no. You see, after a certain time. When love goes away. Something else is left in its place which is even more important. If it's okay with you. It's okay with me. I'm getting paid. - Forget about me for a moment. We must begin to think about your future. You needn't worry about my future. It doesn't bother me. I have no squawk coming. Phew. It's good to be home. Be it ever so humble. I got to get these shoes off before I make another step. They are killing me. I wonder who invented shoes. If the world was carpeted with leather we wouldn't need shoes. We could go barefoot. I wish we'd stayed home. I think they had beef stew. Their stews are terrible. Don't you like stews? - I don't like them when they're noisy. I thought you were going to fight with that man. It's good they threw him out. You were a scream at The Flamingo when you insisted it was your birthday again. Whose birthday? - Your birthday. Oh. My birthday. Yes. Your birthday. - It will be my birthday every day. Of course it is. Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday. Happy birthday, brother. Happy birthday. Pleasant dreams. Psst. I want to talk to you. Come over and sit down. I need your advice. What is the trouble? - I've got a problem. Who hasn't? - It's about Michael. What about him? He doesn't respond. - He doesn't what? I know I'm a capitalist and all that. But it's not my fault. I try to grasp what he says but mainly I don't know what he's talking about. What are you talking about? - You see. I am broadminded. I understand perfectly about you and father. You're getting ahead of yourself. Why shouldn't young people marry older people? Fat people marry thin people. Tall people marry short people. You don't understand the situation. - I'm not a child. Well, alright. You are young and father is old. Michael is poor and I am rich. I love him very much but I just cannot go on waiting for the day. What day? You know. When we're all comrades. Michael calls it dialectical materialism. What does that mean? - I'm not sure. I think it's when everybody will be more-or-less like Michael. I'm a little tired and I think you're a little tired too. What can I do about it? About what? - About Michael. You should talk to your mother. Mother doesn't understand these things. - She is not alone. Perhaps if I got a job it would make a difference. It might be a good idea. - That's what I'll do. If I'm one of the masses he cannot ignore me, can he? I don't know. - You're wonderful. For giving me this good advice. Look, I didn't say anything. I'm unpopular enough in this house. You've been a big help. Is he still downstairs? Who? He probably is. I think I'll go down now and tell him. You are wonderful. Evening, Michael. Can't I have any peace, even at this hour? What are you doing? - I'm working on some plans. May I help? - No. I'm interested in everything you do. Michael. I have a surprise for you. What is it? - I'll need the car at 8 in the morning. You want it in the morning and tomorrow night. That simplifies it all. I won't have to go to bed at all. - No, Michael. I'm not going to the junior league ball tomorrow night. I'm not going to parties or anything like that anymore. You shouldn't come down here dressed in a thing like that. Don't you like it? - No. It's very expensive. What would your mother say? - She has problems of her own. Alright. You want the car at 8. Go on back to bed. - But I'm not tired. Why do you keep following me around? - Don't you know? Please. Go on back to your own side of the house. I haven't told you my surprise yet. Okay. Tell me your surprise. I am going to work. What? I am through with all the frivolous things you don't like. I'll get a job in my father's office or someplace. So. 15 million without jobs and you deprive a worthy person out of their livelihood. Michael. Nothing I do seems to please you. I am only a servant. People aren't supposed to please servants. Nothing. Nothing at all. So the kid is really coming along, eh? Yes. He has some ideas alright. - Well, he is my son. It all hinges on a cheaper pump. - That is out. Amalgamated Pump has a scale .. - Wait a minute. There's something to his idea. He really understands this newfangled credit system. It's his notion that if we extend credit to farmers in places like .. The dust bowl or some South American countries. They'll be able to buy our pumps to irrigate their crops. We can get credit on their notes and keep the factories rolling. As it is now, nobody will make the first move. Sounds simple enough. Why didn't we think of that? - Well, we didn't. Maybe the agents are right after all. Am I butting in? Not at all. Terwilliger and I were talking over a few personal matters. Thanks for dropping in like this. Goodnight. I'll see the pigeon man for you tomorrow. The pigeon man. Don't forget. Tell him I'd like to own that flock, but I can't afford them now. What's all this about long term credit and a cheaper pump? Your pumps have whiskers on them. So have your ideas. If I run the business I run it my way. - Now, wait a minute. Amalgamated Pump set a standard 25 years ago. If the business goes to pot it may just as well go one way or the other. The only way to learn anything is to try new ideas. You are running the business. Do as you like. That's not what I wanted to talk to you about, dad. I worry about mother. She's taken a real beating. I've done nothing. It's not easy for her to live here with another woman around. What other woman? Oh. She doesn't know what it's about. Neither do I. Will you marry the girl? - I don't ask about your personal life. I don't see why you should enquire into mine. You must have some regard for mother. - I think she's a very fine woman. Why not give her a break and talk to her? I didn't know she wanted to talk to me. - She does. She's now upstairs. Look. Why don't we get out of here tonight and leave you two alone? Maybe you can sort things out. Hello Mary. Hello. Sorry I'm late. We were talking over business matters. I'll get dressed now. No hurry. - Dad. I'd be glad to take Miss Grey anyplace you want tonight. I'm on the loose. Don't worry about me, Timothy. I'd as soon spend an evening at home. Wait a minute. Anything wrong with me? Have I got dandruff or something? Mary, I hate to ask this. But would you mind going to the opening with my son? I don't know. I'm really not anxious to go. - Yes, you are anxious. Don't try to tell me. Besides, Mrs Borden and I have things to talk over. Have a nice time. In that case I'm happy to go. That is, if you don't mind taking me. Mind? It will be a pleasure. Is the car outside? Come on then. What's holding us back? Let's go. Good evening, Michael. By the way, where are we going? - I don't know. I don't really feel like going any place. Why not? I feel peculiar all of a sudden. You go to a place you're ashamed to take me? Not exactly ashamed. As a matter of fact we were going for a walk through the park. Evening clothes for a walk in the park? I do it often. - That's why you ordered the car too? No. We were just going to listen to a band concert. Evening clothes to listen to a band concert? I won't submit to the third degree unless you show me a badge. I won't let you walk in the park alone. - I do it quite often. You needn't come along if you're afraid of the dark. How much are your apples? - Five a piece. I'll take two. Want one? - Thanks. It's my dinner? Everything is on me tonight. - Where do we go for the meat course? The zoo is full of animals. Have what you like if you don't mind it raw. You got to work fast to get any place round here. How about a dime for a cup of coffee, lady? Sure. There you go. - Thanks. A friend of yours? - A relative. Say, lady. Mind moving over? Is this the only bench in the park? I met your father on this bench? You couldn't have missed him on a bench like this. I was sitting right here. He was sat there where you are. That makes the bench a museum piece. Is this what you and father do every night? Not every night. You could have picked a bench away from the seal pond. If you want to know about seals, I can tell you. You don't have to. I can smell them. They eat fresh oysters every day. Too bad they don't eat fresh blondes. Then I can get rid of you in a hurry. I was thrown in with them once. But they tossed me out. They're more intelligent than I thought. Why don't you two fight at home? See, you frighten people. Pardon me, bud. Sit down, baby. There is a girl in every port of call in Sweden. It is Hilda. The captain's kiss just slept at home but the sailors kiss near killed her. Why don't you go home? I can sit here as long as you can. One of your friends may hit you over the head. You'd like that. - I like the idea of doing it myself. Would you mind piping down? The lady is listening to the concert. What's the matter with this? And you may raise a little crew. There is nothing that is grander. You'd have a First Mate there with you. Wrap that thing up before I wrap it around your neck. Listen. I do my fighting in the navy, buddy. This is a night for love. An Indian maid was selling beads. They hocked their shirts and collars. In fourteen minutes, by the clock, she'd made ten thousand dollars. The Indian maid fell overboard. The sharks did leap and frolic. They ate her up with relish great. But they shortly died of colic. Pipe down. Look. You frighten me, mister. Is that your boy scout uniform? If you think I'm a boy scout we'll step behind the bushes and you can find out. If you got to go, you got to go. Why not give your boyfriend a liver pill? Why don't you button your lip? Would you ladies like to fight this out? Come on, Minnesota. Let's get out of here. Such common people. Probably some waiter and his moll. Did you come here to fight or listen to the music? I don't know why I came here. If you don't mind, I'd like to do a little listening. That is my favorite piece. Kindly move over please. [ Japanese language ] Hello Mary. Did you have a nice time? What's the matter, son? Anything wrong? I've been waiting for you. - Not tonight please. Some other time. I think you wouldn't want to talk to me. - I don't want to talk to anybody now. I wanted to tell you what I thought of you. I've known some pretty deceitful people in my time. But you're the worst. What did I do? - As if you didn't know. I don't. - You have .. You've made a fool of me. Don't you touch me. What do you think I did to you? I told Michael I was going to get a job. And he almost hit me. He doesn't love me. Someday it will happen to you and then you'll know. So that's what it does to you. Why did you let me do it though? I didn't let you do it. It was your own idea. You could have stopped it. I confided in you. I trusted you. You were the only one I had to go to. I've got to do something about it. - You have done enough. You don't care anything about dad. You only go out with him every night so you can be near Michael. Oh. For heaven's sake. But you won't get him. If I can't have him, nobody can. I hate you. I hate you. No. You don't understand at all. How can we have equality of rights until we have equality of distribution? I never know what Michael is talking about. If the per capita wealth of this country were equally divided .. We'd have 533 dollars and 87 cents each. You say? I got gypped. Listen, boy. Take this into your noodle. I have two thousand dollars in the bank. I work very hard in this house. So neither you nor anybody else can take that money away from me. Remember. Good morning. - Mind if I join you for coffee? Sure. Sit down and I get it. Aren't you stepping out of your class? Me? I have no class. - We wondered about you. What is your position in the household? - Don't ask me. You are not a spy? - I don't think so. Then I can speak freely. - So I hear. Mrs Borden told Higgins that you're an old friend of the family. Good servants never hear anything. Servants? Ha. Slaves to be cast aside by capitalistic overlords. I've warned you about making speeches. - I'll soon be free of these shackles. Talk, talk, talk. Slaves willing to feed the flames of their own unhappiness. Have you ever made anyone unhappy? - That's beside the point. Stop shooting off your mouth until you know more about life. If not for them, there wouldn't be people like me. There will always be people like you. You're softened by your new luxury. - You can have my share of it. I just know that beyond those doors lies the root of civilization's downfall. Beyond those doors. Are a lot of unhappy people and you're partly responsible. You are blaming me? - I'm blaming you for being a dope. You're in love but you haven't enough spunk to fight for the thing you want. Nonsense. Try making others unhappy. To make people believe things you don't believe yourself. You know all about me? - You're like a pane of glass to me. With no courage to be a capitalist yourself, you drag the rest of us down. You are a capitalistic pawn. - I am a what? You're a renegade to your class. - Is that so? Michael. You can't talk to me like that. Michael. You little blond hussy. This is driving me out of my mind. Too much talk. I'll cut out your mouth. Do what you want to me but leave her alone. What's come over me? What's happened? What am I doing? What am I doing? That girl. Get up. Come on. Higgins. You'd better go to the kitchen. There is a revolution or something. Morning. Good morning, Miss Grey. I hope you don't mind my being here. No. Not at all. I want to be a good sport. I know when I am beaten. Let's be friends. - Sure. Sure. Up to this point I haven't been honest. Now I am being very honest. A nice way to be. I'll admit that I hated you at first. - Why shouldn't you? I'll admit I tried every feminine trick I know to get you out of this house. It just hasn't worked. After all, you have youth and beauty on your side. I would not say that altogether. - You might as well be honest too. I'm not really beautiful. I have to fix up a lot. The way things are now, nobody is happy. My husband has made his choice and it's his happiness that interests me. That's why I am .. Stepping aside. - Don't do that. I'm sorry. It does seem too bad that you couldn't have fallen in love with a younger man. I guess that's beside the point. All the young men I know are broke. I hope it isn't Mr Borden's money. - Not exactly. But he has quite a lot of it, hasn't he. Enough for both of us. After all, you deserve something for living with him all these years. Is that how you honestly feel about my husband? Confidentially, I am a little disappointed in him. I like a good time and all that. And he did too at first. I don't know what has come over him. He's beginning to open up at the seams. I'm afraid I don't understand. A sentimental old duck. Always talking about the past. Once, he took me to a joint for beef stew. If there's one thing I hate it's beef stew. I was weaned on it. Mr Borden is a simple, old-fashioned man. I thought of sneaking out on him tonight and going someplace for a real meal. Do you suppose he would mind? - I am sure I don't know. We all have to make our sacrifices. Someday I'll live to like beef stew. I doubt it. I just want you to feel that I am your friend. It's nice to know that. Situations of this kind can become a little messy. Naturally. Nice to know you're on my side. - Yes. Of course. Maybe we can have another talk before you leave. I am sure we can. Yes. I understand perfectly. The boy is coming along alright. Well, just let him alone. Come in. And tell Terwilliger we'll get together next week. I'll have more time then. Thanks. Goodbye. Hello Mary. You are just in time to help with this tie. Where have you been all day? Taking care of some odds and ends. Come on over here and sit down. So I can really get at this thing. I slept most of the day. Why not stay in tonight? I'd love to but we started this thing and we have to go through with it. Think we've gone far enough? You don't know Mrs Borden like I do. - She is cured. Has she been talking to you? - Just to say hello. You have to be careful. She is a very persuasive woman. Especially when she cries. If I stay in this home any longer you'll have no family and I'll have no sanity. You aren't going to run out on me? - Not exactly. I'll put you out when the time comes. If she feels she had anything to do with you leaving, I'm where I started. Whatever you say, but I feel .. Never mind how you feel. You run along and get dressed. You home-wrecker. You siren. Vampire. I guess I am a pretty dreadful person. - You bet you are. I'll see you downstairs in half an hour. Evening. - Good evening. On the prowl again tonight? - Maybe. Any special victim in mind? - I don't play favorites. You're not dressed up. No band concert tonight? If you keep your mouth shut maybe I can hear it from here. The fleet is in. There's a lot of sailors wandering around the park. What's wrong with sailors? They helped win the war. Great lovers too. I guess this is a better spot. Millionaire's walk up and down here. - Thanks for the tip. You get my goat. - Where did you get in the first place? Mind if I sit down here? - Not at all. It's your porch. What there is of it. You ever do anything but sit? - I like to sit. Good evening, Timothy. - Good evening, Martha. Are you going out alone tonight? No. Miss Grey and I are stepping out. Miss Grey has left. - What? You mean she won't be back? I don't know. She said she was going out. That's very rude. I don't like that. I'm having a little snack at home. Would you care to join me? I thought I smelled something cooking. You can smell it here? It must be the onions. Whatever it is, it's very penetrating. Are you sure she won't be back? - Well, she's been gone a half hour. I can hardly believe it. I had a desire for beef stew tonight. Have you got enough? - Plenty. I must look after it. Come on. Alright. Kitchen is deserted. Where are the servants? You're upset now. I don't want to talk about it. What do you mean? As a matter of fact, the cook resigned. The kitchen was in chaos this morning. My maid nearly had a breakdown. Someone ran after someone with a knife. Mind eating in the kitchen? - Who ran after who with a knife? I won't mention names, Timothy. You're so sensitive about Miss .. About some things. I am mad at her right at the moment. I think it's better when people find things out for themselves. You think there's anything wrong with her mentally? I'd rather not say. She's a big disappointment to me. I thought she was a down-to-earth girl. Young people today are so irresponsible. Sit there. I'll be ready in a minute. Don't you want me to help? - No. Just get out of my way. I'm not keeping you from an engagement? No. I was staying home tonight. - But you're all dressed up. This? Just a little informal thing I wear around. It's very pretty. It shows off my figure, doesn't it? Well, it shows a lot of it if that's what you mean. Timothy, go and sit down. There you are. Don't wait for me. Go right ahead. Smells good. Who made it? - Timothy. Oh, is this yours? I thought you'd forgotten how. I don't take a back seat to anyone when it comes to making beef stew. It's delicious. It's a long time since we ate in the kitchen. Yes. But it's nice to know we don't have to eat here if we don't want to. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up any old memories. You bring up any old memories you like. They are very pleasant. That collar looks uncomfortable. Why not take it off? No. I like to get dressed up like this. Tails are very becoming for you. And there's no fool like an old fool. - What do you mean? She ran out on me once before. I didn't expect her to make a habit of it. Timothy, where's your sense of humor? Well, it's not much fun to find yourself left alone at my age. Well, you don't have to be alone if you don't want to, Timothy. I don't want you to be charitable. I'm not being charitable. After all, you're my husband. We've been through a lot together. With the pump business the way it is, I'll probably end up a pauper. We can start over again. After the way I've acted I can't think of asking you to start over again. You haven't acted any worse than I have. We've both been to blame. I'll take the blame for everything. - It's as much my fault as yours. Those innocent little flirtations of yours meant nothing. Of course not. All modern women have escorts. These horrible newspapers ruin more marriages than I care to mention. But let's talk about us. Know what I've done in my spare time? - What? Learning to rumba. I knew you would be pleased. That is wonderful. Let's quit stalling. I admit you've had the household pretty upset. That's okay if it does more good than harm. But I'm tired of this mystery stuff. There's no mystery about me. - You're really a nice girl. That's what you think. - Aren't you? What do you care? You got father all mixed up. Now you got me mixed up. Why pick on me? I've done nothing. You haven't? Not much. - Well, I haven't. Not much. - What did I do? Do to me? - Yes. What? Alright, what? Why not go away? I'm sitting here until you open up. Then you'll be sat here an awfully long time. It was good. Very flattering to see you eat so much. Would you like some bicarbonate of soda? Can't swallow another thing. I can turn on the radio for some music? - That will be fine. Not right now. I don't care for music now. Alright, dear. I rummaged through the attic today and found something that will amuse you. This brings back old memories. Sit down, Timothy. But I warn you. Be prepared for a shock. - Oh? Remember that dashing young couple? The male looks very frightened. - He was. You're a handsomer woman now than you were then. Timothy, you should eat beef stew every night. If people looked at albums oftener they wouldn't take themselves so seriously. Let's skip that one. Remember that sturdy young gentleman? Timothy Borden Junior in the nude. It's hard to believe that cherub is now the head of a great big pump business. The poor fellow. He certainly has his hands full now. I don't like rough stuff. - Why don't you be honest? You're a big strong man, aren't you. Why don't you leave me alone? What's the matter? You afraid? - Not afraid of you. Afraid of yourself? - Keep off or I bat you down with this. Anything wrong, lady? No. Nothing. You'd be about eighteen there. Then Katherine looms on the horizon. Sweet, isn't she? She's the apple of my eye. She was an adorable baby. She always had your eyes. - Think so? I thought she has your eyes. - Hard to believe she's all grown up. She's still our baby. Mother. Darling. We were talking about you. What is it, Michael? Not an accident I hope. Tell her, Michael. - You tell her. Michael and I are man and wife. - You're what? We're married. - Nonsense. It's not nonsense. - Let me see your finger. Married to a chauffeur? - He is not a chauffeur. I relinquish my badge of servitude. Stop handing me this. Go back in the kitchen, Michael. We're inseparable. Go to your room. - Stay where you are. Such insolence. Timothy, send him away. She is out of her mind. You have to go away, Michael. - I'm taking Katherine with me. Naturally. She is your wife. - Oh, dad. Congratulations. Timothy. Now just a minute, Martha. Will you wish us happiness, mother? - This is too much. Married to a chauffeur. - I wasn't much when you married me. She is only a baby. Just about the same age as you were. Huh? Alright. Congratulations, darling. I hope you'll be very happy. Congratulations, Michael. What is your last name? Fairnsbrother. Oh, there is Miss Grey. You were wonderful. - What did I do? If not for you I might have been an old maid. What are you talking about? - Mike and I are married, smarty-pants. What will you live on? - We won't be capitalistic parasites. Are we, Michael? - We're not. What are you going to be? - Michael has his own repair shop. Doesn't that make you a capitalist, Michael? I shall never forget my proletarian beginnings. Come on, babe. You had better tell Miss Grey. Oh yes. Just a minute, Miss Grey. Miss Grey. What have you to say for yourself? Nothing. - Nothing? Is it true that you advised my daughter to elope with the chauffeur? I suppose I did. - You suppose you did? I want you to know that this is the end. You have come between me and my family for the last time. Aren't you being a bit rough, dad? - Rough? After what this woman has done to all of us? Your mother on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Your sister. Look what she has done. You're a wicked, conniving woman. You are a gold digger. A vampire. A siren. You hypnotised me. You've disrupted my household. I must ask you to leave this house. I can't play any longer. I wasn't doing anything to anybody. Just sitting on a park bench and minding my own business. I didn't ask you for this job. You forced it on me. I'm sorry I ever saw you. I'm sorry I've ever been in this place. I can't take it anymore. What was that about a job? Job? Dad. Was she working here? Was she working here? - I tell you I don't .. She was working here. Mary. Mary Grey. Mary. Mary. Mary, don't go away. Her goose is cooked as far as I'm concerned. Timothy. Yes, dear? - Look me in the eye. Timothy Borden, you're an old fake. Well. I suppose it was coming to me. Timothy. Mary. Where do you think you're going? - Why do you care? I do care. I'm going back where I belong. - I'll say you are. Let me down. Let me down. You can't do this to me. Hey, what's going on here? - Why don't you mind your own business? ..w-g..
