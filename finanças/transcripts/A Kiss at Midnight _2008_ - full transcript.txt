[ CAMERA CLICKS ] [ SMOOCHES ] [ BRAKES SQUEAL ] Woman: AT THE CRAFT STORE! HEY. I GOT ALMOST EVERYTHING ON MY LIST. THE CROWDS AT THE STORES WERE UNBELIEVABLE. WELL, I TOLD YOU IF YOU WAIT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON OF NEW YEAR'S EVE TO DO YOUR SHOPPING, IT WAS GONNA BE LIKE THAT. CARLA? YEAH, BOSS? WHAT DO YOU THINK I WANT FROM YOU RIGHT NOW? THE HEAD COUNT FOR THE PARTY. AH, YOU NEVER CEASE TO AMAZE ME. OOH! ME TOO. [ CHUCKLES ] ARE YOU SURE YOU AND MAC DON'T WANT TO COME OVER? OH, NO, THANKS.

INTERPERSONAL ATTACHMENTS ARE KEY TO A HEALTHY PSYCHE. YOU ARE SUCH A FREAK. SWEETHEART. YOU RUN ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ONLINE DATING SERVICES, AND YOU CAN'T USE YOUR MATCHMAKING SKILLS TO GET YOURSELFA DATE? I'M NOT A MATCHMAKER. I'M SIMPLY A GUY THAT KNOWS HOW TO WORK WITH COMPUTERS. AND, NO, I DO NOT NEED A DATE, BECAUSE I HAVE THE BOTH OF YOU TWO. COME ON. LET'S GO GET SOME PARTY HATS AND CHIP DIP.

I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT TONIGHT. YOU SOUNDED DESPERATE FOR HELP ON THE PHONE. SISTER EMMA WAS FREE TO TAKE MY SHIFT, SO IT ALL WORKED OUT. I FEEL A LITTLE GUILTY ABOUT TAKING YOU AWAY FROM THE HOSPITAL. YOU REALLY THINK YOU GOT AWAY WITH IT, DON'T YOU? WITH WHAT? CHANGING THE SUBJECT, YOUR LITTLE DIVERSION. I WASN'T BORN YESTERDAY, MY FRIEND. COME ON, OUT WITH IT. WHAT'S YOUR NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION? IT'S NOTHING. IT'S JUST SOMETHING I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT. YEAH? YOU KNOW, SEEING ALL MY COUPLES HERE TOGETHER AND... TURNING 40 THIS YEAR. COME ON! SPIT IT OUT! I CAN'T. I WROTE IT DOWN. HAND IT OVER. THERE WE GO. "BY NEXT NEW YEAR'S EVE, I, SUSAN FLOWERS, WILL HAVE FOUND THE PERFECT MAN AND WILL KISS AT MIDNIGHT." [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAY] [ SNORING ] [ BOTH GIGGLING ] WHY ARE YOU GUYS STILL UP? WE COULD ASK YOU THE SAME THING. I'M WATCHING "WHEN SCORPIONS RULED THE EARTH." THAT IS SO LAME, DAD. [ CHUCKLES ] NO, IT'S QUITE EXCITING. SHE'S NOT REFERRING TO THE MOVIE. ALTHOUGH I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN A BETTER WORD. "PATHETIC" MIGHT FIT THE BILL. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT? YOU, SITTING HERE ALL BY YOURSELF ON THE MOST AMAZING PARTY NIGHT OF THE YEAR. TRUST ME. IT IS OVERRATED. I BET YOU AND MOM USED TO GO OUT TO CELEBRATE AT STUPENDOUS NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTIES. WELL, THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. I REMEMBER ONE TIME I SNUCK OUT OF BED TO WATCH YOU GUYS LEAVE. MOM WAS WEARING THIS SILVER, GLITTERY DRESS. AH HA HA! I KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS ARE UP TO, AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA FOOL ME. YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE SO YOU CAN STAY UP LATE, AND YOU CAN'T FIND ONE. DAD! DAD! "DAD"! COME ON, BACK TO BED. BUT THIS ONLY HAPPENS ONCE A YEAR. WE CAN SLEEP IN TOMORROW. HAPPY NEW YEAR, JENNIFER. I LOVE YOU. HAPPY NEW YEAR, CASSIE. I LOVE YOU, TOO. NOW GET LOST.

[ LOCK ENGAGES ] [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] [ DOOR CREAKS ] IT'S OKAY. JUST ME. BAD DREAM? I THOUGHT IT WAS DAD. NO, HE FELL ASLEEP DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE TV ON. LIKE HE DOES EVERY NIGHT. SO, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT HIM? YOU HAVE TO BE MORE SPECIFIC. HE HAS NO SOCIAL LIFE. YOU HAVE A POINT. SO, HE'LL NEVER MEET ANYONE. A LOGICAL CONCLUSION. I'D LIKE FOR DAD TO BE HAPPY AGAIN, THE WAY HE WAS WHEN MOM WAS ALIVE. I DON'T REMEMBER BACK THAT FAR. AND I WOULDN'T MIND HAVING A WOMAN TO TALK TO. PERSONALLY, I CAN GET ALONG QUITE WELL WITHOUT FEMALE INPUT. THAT'S BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH YOU USE ALL THOSE GINORMOUS WORDS, YOU'RE STILL A CHILD. YOU HAVEN'T GOT... ISSUES THAT YOU NEED TO DISCUSS WITH A FEMALE. BUT I DO. SO, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT WE HAVE TO FIND DAD AN APPROPRIATE FEMALE COMPANION -- SOMEONE WHO WILL BE A GOOD PARTNER FOR HIM AND A SUITABLE MENTOR FOR YOU. THAT'S EXACTLYWHAT I'M SAYING, ONLY IN ENGLISH. I'LL GO ONLINE AND RESEARCH THE SUBJECT IN THE MORNING. NOW GO BACK TO BED. CAN I STAY HERE? AS LONG AS YOU DON'T SNORE. [ CHUCKLES ] IT'S NOT FAIR. WHAT'S NOT FAIR? THAT YOU HAVE MEMORIES OF MOM AND I DON'T. GO TO SLEEP. [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] [ DOOR OPENS ] MR.

OH, HONEY, CAN YOU DO ME A TEENY FAVOR? SURE. WHAT? WELL, WHILE I WAS ON THE CRUISE, I WAS THINKING -- YOU AND I ARE REALLY MORE LIKE FRIENDS THAN MOTHER AND DAUGHTER. FRIENDS? EXACTLY. GIRLFRIENDS, BUDDIES. SO, UH, HOW ABOUT FROM NOW ON, YOU CALL ME "KAY" INSTEAD OF "MOM"? [ GASPS ] YOU MET A MAN! THAT'S WHAT IT IS, ISN'T IT? NO! YES! [ LAUGHS ] MOM! KAY! [ LAUGHS ] AWW. I HOPE YOU'RE NOT UPSET. UPSET? NO, I'M ECSTATIC. AWW. GOOD. I'M SO RELIEVED. I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO MEET HIM. OH, THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE HE'S WAITING FOR US AT THE RESTAURANT. WHAT? OH, NO! [ LAUGHS ] I DON'T EVEN -- HOW DO I LOOK? YOU LOOK DIVINE. [ LAUGHS ] OH, HIS NAME IS ARTHUR -- ARTHUR WRIGHT. YOU MET "MR. RIGHT." IT'S SPELLED WITH A "W," BUT HE IS MYMR. RIGHT. OH, GOOD. [ Singsong voice ] AND REMEMBER -- I KNOW -- "KAY." "KAY" IT IS. I HOPE YOU LIKE HIM. I'LL LOVE HIM. THAT'S GOOD. Arthur: SO SHE SAYS, "NO WONDER HE CAN'T WEAR GLASSES. IT'S NOT THAT HE HAS ONE EYE. HE ONLY HAS ONE EAR." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE A BAD BOY, ARTIE. [ CHUCKLES ] OH, UH, YOUR MOTHER TELLS ME YOU'RE A MATCHMAKER? WELL, I-I OWN HEARTS & FLOWERS. IT'S A SMALL MATCHMAKING BUSINESS.

[ BOTH GIGGLE ] I'M JOSH -- JOSH SHERMAN. UH, SUSAN -- SUSAN FLOWERS. HI, SUSAN. THIS IS MY ELDEST DAUGHTER, JENNIFER, AND CASSIE. HI. HI. HI. NICE TO MEET YOU. SO, SHOULD WE FOLLOW YOU? YES, FOLLOW ME. ALL RIGHT. COME ON. Remember -- when we get there, we can't leave them alone, even for a moment, in case she mentions his e-mail. SO, YOU, UM, YOU COME HERE A LOT, YOU -- OH, ON AND OFF. MY DAD AND I USED TO COME HERE EVERY SUNDAY MORNING WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, JUST THE TWO OF US. WE WOULD GET UP REALLY EARLY, AND THEN WE'D GO FOR HIKES FOR LIKE TWO HOURS ALONG THE TRAILS IN THE PARK, AND THEN WE'D COME BACK HERE AND HAVE A HUGE BREAKFAST. SOUNDS LIKE A REAL TREAT. YEAH. OUR LITTLE FAMILY TRADITION. LIKE YOU HAVING LUNCH WITH THE GIR-- HOW WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? EVERY FAMILY HAS TRADITIONS. IT'S...UNIVERSAL. YEAH. BY THE WAY, I LOVE YOUR SHIRT. I MEAN -- THIS OLD THING? YEAH, I HAVE ONE FROM THEIR CONCERT AT THE FORUM -- IN '88? YOU KNOW ABOUT THE OWLS? [ SCOFFS ] IT'S ONLY, LIKE, MY FAVORITE BAND. WELL, IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THERE'S STILL A FEW OF US OUT THERE. YEAH, JUST A FEW. Cassie: AND THEN SNOWFLAKE SUDDENLY STOPPED, AND I FELL STRAIGHT INTO THE BUSHES. [ LAUGHS ] I HOPE ALL YOU HURT WAS YOUR PRIDE. OH, SHE WAS FINE. IWAS THE ONE IN SHOCK. DAD'S A WORRIER -- NOT IN A BAD WAY. NOT AT ALL. HE'S A VERY SOLID PERSON. Susan: YOUR GIRLS CERTAINLY THINK A LOT OF YOU. THAT'S VERY SWEET. ANDSURPRISING. WELL, I GUESS WE BETTER GO. YEAH. COME ON, GIRLS. WE SHOULD GET TOGETHER AGAIN. OH. WHAT A NICE IDEA. WHAT DO YOUTHINK, DAD? UH...WELL, YEAH, SURE. [ CHUCKLES ] YOU SHOULD, LIKE, EXCHANGE NUMBERS OR SOMETHING. THAT'S OUR HOME NUMBER AND DAD'S CELL. THANK YOU. WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT -- IF ELIZABETH EVER QUITS, I KNOW WHO'S GONNA REPLACE HER. I ALWAYS CARRY OUR NUMBERS, IN CASE OF EMERGENCY. DO YOU? I'M NOT AS EFFICIENT, BUT I COULD PROBABLY WRITE IT DOWN -- [ CELLPHONE DROPS ] OHH! OH, GOODNESS. WE'VE GOT IT. LET ME JUST GET THAT. THANK YOU. YOU HAVE VERY POLITE CHILDREN. YES, WELL, THIS MORNING HAS BEEN A REVELATION. HERE YOU GO. THERE'S MY NUMBER. ALL RIGHT. COME ON, GIRLS -- IN THE CAR. IT WAS LOVELY TO MEET YOU. YOU TOO. HEY, MAUREEN, IT'S ME -- SUSAN. HE WAS NOTHING LIKE I THOUGHT HE'D BE. Maureen: Are you running for your life? SERIOUSLY, SUSAN, YOU OKAY? He's great! GIVE ME SOME QUICK DETAILS. I'M ON DUTY. OKAY. HE'S FUNNY, SMART, KIND OF CUTE. MAYBE THE COMPUTER GOT IT RIGHT. Okay, don't remind me. [ CHUCKLES ] I WON'T. TELL ME MORE. HIS DAUGHTERS WERE QUIRKY AND SWEET. HE SEEMS LIKE A GOOD DAD. AND THE WHOLE ACCIDENTAL-MEETING THING TOTALLY WORKED LIKE A CHARM. Well, when are you seeing him again? I DON'T KNOW. SOON, I HOPE. NO. NO. HOPING ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH. WE GOT TO COME UP WITH A PLAN OF ACTION. I'LL BE OVER AT 7:00. ORDER A PIZZA WITH THE WORKS. Josh: WHO WANTS SALAD? ME! ME! "ME"! [ CHUCKLES ] I saw her business card when her stuff fell out -- Hearts & Flowers, with pictures of flowers all over it. She must be a florist. Like her name. Cool. [ CHUCKLES ] Josh: HERE YOU GO. SO, DAD, WHEN ARE YOU GONNA CALL SUSAN FLOWERS? WHY WOULD I CALL HER? BECAUSE YOU LIKED HER, AND SHE GAVE YOU HER NUMBER. THE ONLY REASON SHE GAVE ME HER NUMBER IS 'CAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RUDE NOT TO. YOU GUYS PUT HER ANDME IN A REALLY AWKWARD POSITION. BUT WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT YOU LIKED HER, CORRECT? SHE WAS NICE ENOUGH. AND SHE'S THE ONLY OTHER HUMAN BEING ON THE PLANET THAT'S HEARD OF THE GOLDEN OWLS. [ LAUGHS ] UNH-UNH. EXACTLY. YOU HAVE THINGS IN COMMON. YOU HAVE HER NUMBER. YOU SHOULD CALL HER. I REST MY CASE. IMPRESSIVE. BUT COUNSEL LEFT OUT ONE SIGNIFICANT DETAIL. AND WHAT WOULD THAT BE? SHE'S PROBABLY GOT A BOYFRIEND. NO, SHE DOESN'T. HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT? BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE SHE HAS A SIGNIFICANT OTHER. AND HOW DO PEOPLE WITH SIGNIFICANT OTHERS LOOK? NOT LIKE HER. [ GROANS ] EAT YOUR PIZZA. SUSAN, FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S GREAT AT GIVING DATING ADVICE, YOU'RE REALLY LOUSY AT TAKING IT. NO. I WENT ALONG WITH HIS PLAN TO MEET THE GIRLS HIS WAY. THE NEXT MOVE IS UP TO HIM. YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF MEN COULD FIT ON THE HEAD OF A PIN. OKAY, PLEASE... ENLIGHTEN ME ABOUT MEN, SISTER MAUREEN. THEY HAVE TROUBLE MAKING UP THEIR OWN MINDS. THEY APPRECIATE A LITTLE PUSH IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IT'S ALL IN THE BIBLE. STARTING WITH ADAM AND EVE. MAYBE THAT WASN'T EXACTLY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, BUT IT GOT THINGS ROLLING BIG-TIME. SO, SHOULD I OFFER HIM AN APPLE? NO, NOT EXACTLY. JUST...SEND HIM A FRIENDLY E-MAIL AND TELL HIM HOW MUCH YOU ENJOYED MEETING HIM AND HIS DAUGHTERS AND SUGGEST A FOLLOW-UP COFFEE. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] WHAT? I'M NOT EXPECTING ANYONE. MAYBE IT'S A DOZEN ROSES. YOU ARE WAY TOO ROMANTIC FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] I KNEW YOU'D BE HOME. WHAT -- HELLO, MY DEAR. HI, KAY. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WELL, YOU DIDN'T ANSWER ANY OF MY E-MAILS, NOR ANY OF MY OTHER MESSAGES. SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO. I HEAR CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER. OH, SO YOU KNOW? I'M SURPRISED SUSAN SHARED THE NEWS WITH YOU. WHY WOULDN'T I? BECAUSE YOU SEEMED LESS THAN THRILLED. I GAVE MY PERMISSION, DIDN'T I? YES, YOU DID. AND THEN YOU LOOKED LIKE YOU'D HAD A ROOT CANAL. ANYWAY, YOU PROBABLY COULD NOT HAVE SAID NO, COULD YOU? I-I CAN TELL YOU TWO NEED TO TALK. I SHOULD GO. NO, NO. PLEASE STAY. [ SIGHS ] [ SIGHS ] SUSAN, I WANT YOU TO TRY. TRY WHAT? TO HAVE AN OPEN MIND. I AMTRYING. WELL, THEN TRY HARDER. [ SIGHS ] [ SIGHS ] WHAT DO YOU -- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? SUSAN, FROM THE TIME I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, I DREAMED OF THE PERFECT WEDDING. AHHH, THE PERFECT GOWN. I MADE SKETCHES. I CUT PICTURES OUT OF MAGAZINES. I HAD A WHOLE SCRAPBOOK FULL OF "KAY'S WEDDING GOWNS." THEN I MET YOUR DAD. HE WAS BEING SHIPPED OUT TO VIETNAM. IT WAS A WHIRLWIND ROMANCE. THERE WASN'T TIME. YOU KNOW THE STORY. YEAH, YEAH. ALL YOU HAD TIME FOR WAS TO TAKE OUT A LICENSE AND GET DOWN TO CITY HALL. RIGHT. SO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT "KAY'S GOWNS." I MEAN, ALL THAT REALLY MATTERED WAS YOUR DAD. BUT NOW, SUSAN, ALL THESE YEARS LATER, I GET ANOTHER CHANCE. AND I WANT YOU TO HELP ME PICK OUT MY GOWN. YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU PICK OUT YOUR GOWN? I'D LOVE TO DO THAT. YES? MM-HMM. [ BOTH LAUGH ] YES! THANK YOU. Jennifer: IT'S HOPELESS. HE'S NEVER GONNA CALL HER. SHE'S A MODERN WOMAN. MAYBE SHE'LL CALL HIM. NO WAY. SHE THINKS THAT HE MADE HER DO ALL THAT STUPID PRETEND STUFF TO MEET US. IF DAD DOESN'T CALL HER, THEN HE'LL SEEM LIKE A JERK. AND WHY WOULD SUSAN WANT TO DATE A JERK? YOUR LANGUAGE IS A LITTLE CRUDE, BUT THE ANALYSIS IS FLAWLESS. THANKS. I THINK. HEY, HOW ABOUT WE SET UP A MEETING TOMORROW AT MAY PARK, MAYBE GET A COFFEE AND GO FOR A STROLL? AND HOW DO WE GET DAD TO BE THERE, SMARTY? WE DON'T. "DEAR JOSH." WHAT DO YOU THINK? TOO FORMAL? [ WHIMPERS ] YEAH. [ KEYS CLACKING ] "HI, JOSH. SO GREAT MEETING YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTERS." NAH. "GIRLS." "MEETING YOU AND THE GIRLS." [ DING ] WHAT? WHO COULD BE E-MAILING ME AT THIS HOUR? [ KEYS CLACKING ] OH. [ WHIMPERS ] "HI, SUSAN. THANKS FOR COMING TODAY. "MY GIRLSJUST LOVED YOU. HOW ABOUT COFFEE TOMORROW AT 2:00 AT MAY PARK?" HMM. WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW? [ Cockney accent ] WHAT DO YOU KNOW, BAILEY? SHOULD I ANSWER? [ Normal voice ] "HI, JOSH. "SOUNDS GREAT. SEE YOU THEN." [ CHILDREN SHOUTING PLAYFULLY ] Cassie: SUSAN! WAIT! OH! HI, GIRLS. I-I THOUGHT I WAS MEETING YOUR DAD. HE DIDN'T COME WITH US. WE TOLD HIM WE WERE GOING TO A MOVIE. I'M...NOT FOLLOWING THIS. WHY DON'T WE ALL SIT DOWN? OKAY. WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK? AN ICE CREAM? OUR TREAT. WE POOLED OUR ALLOWANCE. NO, THANK YOU. SO, TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. WELL, IT'S LIKE THIS -- OUR DAD HAS BEEN ON HIS OWN FOR QUITE A LONG TIME NOW. SIX YEARS. I KNOW. AND I'M SORRY. THANK YOU. OUR DAD WAS REALLY SAD FOR A LONG TIME. AND THE THING IS, WE'VE DECIDED THE TIME HAS COME FOR HIM TO START DATING AGAIN. YOUDECIDED? WE DID QUITE A BIT OF RESEARCH, AND YOU WERE THE TOP CANDIDATE. WELL, I'M VERY FLATTERED. BUT HOW DOES YOUR DAD FIT INTO ALL OF THIS? THAT NOTE YOU GOT FROM "DELIGHTFUL DAD" WE WROTE IT. WELL, MAINLY I WROTE IT. SO, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. PRETENDING TO BE YOUR FATHER AND WAITED FOR RESPONSES. IS THAT IT? MM-MM... MORE OR LESS. YOU HAVE TO LET HIM KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. NO! NO! HE LIKED YOU, SUSAN, BUT IF HE FOUND OUT ABOUT ALL OF THIS, THAT WOULD BE THE END OF IT. AND HE'D BE ALONE FOREVER. WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST TRY TO BE PATIENT, LET YOUR DAD DO WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO IN HIS OWN TIME. YOU DON'T KNOW HIM. HE'S VERY STUBBORN. IN A GOOD WAY. IF YOU COULD CALL HIM SO HE KNOWS YOU'RE FREE AND JUST GIVE IT A CHANCE, WE PROMISE TO TELL HIM EVERYTHING. OKAY, LOOK, GIRLS, HERE'S THE DEAL -- I'LL CALL YOUR FATHER. I'LL GO ON ONE DATE WITH HIM. AT THE END OF THAT DATE, YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH. ONE DATE?! THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TIME! EITHER THAT, OR I CALL HIM RIGHT NOW AND TELL HIM. HOW ABOUT THREEDATES? PLEASE! [ INHALES SHARPLY ] TWO. TWO DATES. FINAL OFFER. YOU DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN, SUSAN. IT'S A DEAL. DEAL. DEAL. Kay: WE NEED TO HURRY, 'CAUSE ARTIE'S TAKING ME TO VEGAS FOR THE WEEKEND. OKAY. ARE YOU READY? AS I'LL EVER BE. OKAY. [ GASPS ] WOW! DO YOU LIKE IT? YES. HAIR DOWN OR UP? JUST LIKE THAT. JUST LIKE THAT? YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL. OH, I FEELBEAUTIFUL. I DO. I THINK IT'S BECAUSE I'M SO IN LOVE. OH, BABY, THAT'S THE WAY I WANT YOU TO FEEL, TOO. MAYBE THIS NICE WIDOWER IS THE ONE THAT'S GONNA MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE THAT. WE'LL SEE. BABY, DON'T BE LIKE THAT. LIKE WHAT? LIKE CAUTIOUS. SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED TO TAKE A CHANCE, JUMP IN WITH BOTH FEET. LOOK AT ME. YEAH, YOU'VE CERTAINLY JUMPED IN. [ BOTH LAUGH ] Arthur: ANY GORGEOUS BRIDES IN HERE? ARTIE, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SEE ME. IT'S BAD LUCK. DON'T YOU COME IN TILL I GET OUT. IS IT SAFE YET? YEAH, SHE'S IN THE DRESSING ROOM. HEY, I GOT A RIDDLE FOR YOU. WHY DO BRIDES ALWAYS WEAR WHITE? WHY? MATCHES EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE KITCHEN. [ BOTH LAUGH ] HEY, I BET SHE LOOKS LIKE A MILLION BUCKS. YOU'D WIN THAT BET, ARTHUR. HEY, CALL ME "ARTIE." BETTER YET, WHY DON'T YOU CALL ME "POPS"? ALL MY NEPHEWS AND NIECES CALL ME "POPS." I THINK I'LL STICK WITH "ARTHUR." YOU -- YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU SHOULD SIT, 'CAUSE SH-- SHE MIGHT TAKE A WHILE. [ SUSAN CLEARS THROAT ] GOOD MORNING. I WOULDN'T JUMP TO ANY CONCLUSIONS. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? SO, HOW'S THAT ROMANCE-4-YOU EXPOSé COMING? EH, I'M WORKING ON IT.

IT'S GOING TO BE NO DIFFERENT TO ANY OTHER SUNDAY NIGHT, GIRLS. WE'LL EAT IN THE DINING ROOM, OF COURSE, USING THE GOOD CHINA. [ LAUGHS ] WE DON'T HAVE GOOD CHINA. THEN WE'LL BUY SOME. AND I'LL PUT TOGETHER A CD OF APPROPRIATE CLASSICAL DINNER MUSIC. AND WE NEED FLOWERS! SHE'S A FLORIST. SO HER THING IS FLOWERS. YEAH. HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE'S A FLORIST? I SAW HER BUSINESS CARD. SHE OWNS HER OWN SHOP. FLORIST. THAT'S NICE. AND, DAD, YOU SHOULD REALLY GET SOME NEW CLOTHES -- SOMETHING FROM THIS CENTURY. GUYS, HERE'S A REALITY CHECK, OKAY? ALL THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS A GUEST, WHO HAPPENS TO BE A WOMAN, IS COMING OVER FOR DINNER. WE'RE NOT GONNA PRETEND THAT WE'RE ANYTHING WE'RE NOT. YOU'RE RIGHT. AND DON'T TELL HER WHAT YOU DO. DID YOU HEAR A WORD I SAID? UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU DISCUSS YOUR PROFESSION. [ LAUGHS ] JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, WHY NOT? WELL -- WELL, IF I WAS A WOMAN, WHICH I WILL BE SOMEDAY SOON, I'D THINK HE HAD A LOT OF GIRLFRIENDS. SO I WOULDN'T WANT TO DATE HIM. I SEE. IF IT COMES UP, JUST TELL HER YOU'RE A BUSINESSMAN. WITH DIVERSE INTERESTS. YEAH, DIVERSE INTERESTS -- THAT SOUNDS COOL. TOO BAD I DON'T HAVE TIME BEFORE SUNDAY TO GROW A GOATEE. IT WOULD SUIT YOU. Susan: WHAT A LOVELY TABLE. OH, THIS IS NOTHING.

WELL, SOMETIMES, WHEN A BOY REALLY LIKES YOU, HE PRETENDS TO BE MEAN TO YOU. REALLY? IT'S THE TRUTH. THAT EXPLAINS A LOT. SO, SUSAN... WOULD YOU SAY BOYS PREFER GIRLS WITH OR WITHOUT GLASSES? GLASSES ARE DEFINITELY A PLUS. I MEAN, SOMETIMES. I MEAN, FOR ONE THING THEY MAKE YOUR EYES LOOK BIGGER, WHICH IS ALWAYS ATTRACTIVE. [ GIGGLES ] AND THEY LET A BOY KNOW THAT HE'S DEALING WITH A YOUNG WOMAN WHO'S VERY SECURE WITH WHO SHE IS. [ CHUCKLES ] [ CHUCKLES ] WELL, I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO APOLOGIZE. FOR WHAT? WELL, I'M SURE SITTING AROUND WITH A COUPLE OF KIDS ALL NIGHT WASN'T YOUR IDEA OF A GREAT DATE. ARE YOU KIDDING? I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I HAD THIS MUCH FUN. IT WAS WONDERFUL SEEING THE GIRLS WITH YOU. I HADN'T REALIZED HOW MUCH THEY NEEDED... WELL, WHEN THEIR MOM DIED, I SWORE TO MYSELF THAT I WOULD BE THE BEST DAD ANDMOM IN THE WORLD TO THEM.

W-WHAT ABOUT "KAY'S GOWN"? KAY'S GOW-- YOU KNOW WHAT? ON YOUR BIG DAY, SHOULD YOU WANT IT, YOU CAN HAVE KAY'S GOWN. BUT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR DREAM WEDDING. SWEETHEART, IT'S NOT ABOUT A GOWN. MY DREAM IS REALLY ABOUT FINDING SOMEONE THAT I HAVE A CHANCE AT HAPPINESS WITH. REALLY. OH. CONGRATULATIONS. OH, BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL LEFT OUT.
