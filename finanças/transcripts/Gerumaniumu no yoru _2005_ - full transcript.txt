Do you have any paint thinner? Germanium Crystal Radio Kit Stealing's wrong, you know? We celebrate the mass of your death and resurrection, Lord Jesus... and give thanks that we may serve you. Are there insects out now, Sensei? Folidol's the king of pesticides. It's banned now, but it affects an insect's nervous system. A person's, too. What happens? You get lethargic, I guess. Then depressed... you want to die. Rou! Rou! You gotta see this! Amazing! The sow looks like she's in pain. She's a virgin. He hasn't got it in her. Put it in for him. Well? It won't go in! Why not? Maybe it's not hard enough? Rub it. What are you guys doing? Did you know the tip's curly? Curly? Move. Hello! Scoutmaster! What's wrong with him? Chicken bones? They stick in his throat. When they break, they have sharp points. I'm sorry! He'll be OK. Do you think so? Dogs can digest just about anything. The bones'll dissolve. You're not a sister, are you? I'm an 'aspirant'... Someone who very much wants to become a holy virgin. I know. I did my schooling here. Do you think the Lord Jesus did it with Mary Magdalene? Did what? Why are you holding me up? I'm being leaned on. You OK? What a smell! But it's the smell of life. Father Komiya said you were an admirable young man. I didn't come back here to be a monk. Don't you want to know why I did? Why did you come back? I kind of killed some people. I needed a place to hide out from the police. What sin did you really commit? I told you. Don't pretend you're so evil. Rape. You're posing. It beats posing as clever... or holier-than-thou. Is it really true... you raped someone? Is that a hearing aid? Ouch! The whispering of the Gods. Where's your thing? I'm gonna come! Go ahead. So that was your first time... How did it feel? Really... warm. I came inside you. Is that OK? I'm happiest when I've been filled. Make it hurt. Make it hurt, please. You start on slops today. Slops? We've both done it. We share work here. I've come for the slops. Close the door. Yes, ma'am. What did you do to Kyoko? There's a story where a monkey peels and peels an onion. When there's nothing left, it gets angry. 'Shallot', not 'onion'... Help me. 'Curettage'. Did you know? She conceived a child that was forcibly removed with a curette. Her womb was badly scarred... her heart, too. I was appalled when she told me about it. But we cannot expel her. For one thing... she curses the infertility this has brought upon her. As well... she curses the father who forced it on her. And the mother who simply wrung her hands. And the helplessness of the man who should have loved her. I want to help her. Anger is easy to feel. What is easy is comfortable. Comfort is the first step towards decadence. Anyway... I have some vague idea about the two of you. 'Curette' is a difficult character, Sister. 'Theresa'. Sister Theresa, can you write 'curette'? Now, tell me what's between you and Kyoko? I can't put it in words. What do you mean? That make your eyes water? You're not right in the head. Why didn't you say you were going? I'd have helped! You bastards! All that shit about sharing work! I'm sorry! I'll take it from here. Look, Rou, fighting won't solve anything. Say what you want to say. I'll listen. We can talk this out. Talking won't solve anything. Get some stones. Stones? Too small. Eat. Eat what? The stones. I can't. Put them in your mouth. I'll fucking put them in for you! I mean... 'let me help you with that'. I had it wrong... forgive me. Forgive me. You slipped on shit in the cowshed. You smashed your face on the floor. You'd better not sleep tonight. It'll swell up more and take longer to heal. The teeth won't grow back, though. We mustn't! Did you make love with Sister Theresa? No. Really? I didn't. I don't believe you. I didn't, I said. You're lying. I'm not! But you just got bigger. And harder. Yeah... So it happened? No, it didn't! All I want is... to hurt her. To break her. You like her, don't you? Yeah. ...and give thanks, Amen. Open your heart to the voice of God, who calls on you to repent. For Jesus has said... "if ye forgive men their trespasses, your Heavenly Father... "will also forgive you. "But if ye forgive not, neither will He forgive yours." Rou... trust in God's mercy, and confess your sins. Sensei... I have killed. I see... Doesn't that shock you? You have confessed to me... and because you know that, as your Confessor, I cannot repeat what l have heard here. Yes. Who did you kill, and how? It was several months ago. I don't remember the date... A man and a woman. Thinking back, I had no real reason to kill them. I got angry and killed them both. Rou, you don't feel guilty? Not at all. That wouldn't change anything. As a matter of fact, I've lost my virginity since I came back. Now you're making fun of me. A little, yes. A sister here will have my child. "His name shall be called Emmanuel." Don't blaspheme. I'm sorry. Rou... I guess I was right about you. You were? You're testing me. And God, and religion. Neither you nor God has the power to punish a sinner like me. If there were a God he'd punish me, right here and now. Rou... did you murder two people and violate a woman's chastity... just to play out this scene? I wasn't thinking of it at first. But now I'm sure that's why. Sensei... What is it? I don't mind spending my life pushing your wheelchair. - Thank you. - I mean that. I know. Of all of us, you're the closest to religion. Having you say that almost makes me want to cry. There you go again... Iying with a straight face. The feeling of wanting to be with you isn't a lie. I know that. I want to bring you grief. I'm guilty of murder and lust... I lash out at everything, and no-one can punish me. I want that made obvious. I get excited, imagining you hauled away... and tortured to make you talk... about my crime. I've already sacrificed my legs. What do you want now? Your life. I see. Can even someone like me be forgiven? Yes. I've been hearing confession for over 50 years. Forgiveness is God's other name. If forgiveness is all that's needed, you and God have an easy job. Say three Hail Marys and you will be forgiven. Just three? I feel like you've won. Aw, to hell with it! Erm... "Have mercy on me, O God, in your love. "ln Your compassion, forgive my sin. "Wash me thoroughly of my guilt, cleanse me of evil..." Your heart's not in it. Yeah, it sounds stupid. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. "Hail Mary, full of grace! The Lord is with you. "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. "Holy Mary, Mother of God... ""pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. "" Sensei... - Yes? - Are you tired? No, I'm fine. Speak. OK. Among those sins I confessed to... the one about violating a nun is in the future. The future? Yes. It hasn't happened yet. You planned this. I said a sister would have my child, who shall be called 'Emmanuel'. Like in the Gospel of Matthew, I'm fulfilling a prophecy. The sister is still a virgin. It's immaculate conception. Doesn't make sense, huh? You really want to torment me... No! The sister is still a true virgin. But I've confessed to a future sin. A sin confessed, must be carried out... otherwise both you and God have forgiven a sin that doesn't exist. The sacrament of forgiveness is made incomplete. And because you have forgiven this future sin... I now have license from God. I can now in conscience proceed to carry it out. Get out. Leave. Never come back. "...and grant eternal rest to our fathers and mothers... "brothers, sisters, kin, mentors and friends... "who have already departed this life." I loved Father Togawa. - And he loved you. - No, he hated me. That's not true. His last words were, "Rou is closest of us all". - 'Closest'? - Yes. That was revenge. What was? Those last words. I wanted to be furthest. So for him to say I'm closest... Well, I don't know what happened. Nice moon, isn't it? It's so pale... Are you crying? You really did love Father Togawa... My chest hurts. Just keep struggling. - I should struggle? - Yep. You already are. You beat up Ukawa. I just hate whistling. Ukawa and Kita are your dogs. Everyone wants to be a dog. Not you. You just want to die, don't you? But you can't. I'm leaving the order. I'll go back home, and spread tons of pesticide. Do you love Domenico Savio? No, not especially. What do you think of what he said? "Death rather than sin"? What is sin? That's what I want to know. Being soiled. - 'Soiled'? - Yes. Toru... I'm as soiled as they come. Where are you going? To service the Rector. Father Komiya? Yep. Father Komiya... is a sinner. I'm afraid... afraid you'll leave. I'll always be here. You'll get tired of me and leave. I know it. Father, why do old men smell? - Do old men smell? - Yes. Do I smell? Yes. Do I smell bad? When I'm in bed, I remember your smell... Come here. Rou... you're the one who took care of Ukawa, aren't you? I want to lick your spit. I want to lick your spit! What should I do? Hold out the palm of your hand... and hork one into it. You'll lick that? That's right. You'll be sick... Sick? You called me 'sick'?! No, from licking my spit. I'll get sick? Yes! You called me sick! That's not what I meant. Give me that! I want it! I'm hard... My weenie... Wait a minute! Kneel down... and suck it. Suck it? You know what I mean! This! Fuck off. You're angry... Here, I'll suck yours first. That's not what I mean, pervert! 'Pervert'? Change of plan! Kick guts! Guts! Guts! Kick guts! Guts! Guts! Kick guts! Guts! Guts! Kick guts! I'll jerk you off. Real hard, like when you do it yourself? Yes... I'll do it. If you would, then. Yummy! Keep your hands off my puke! I'll suck it! I'll suck it. Really? Really. You're trying to trick me... you're going to bite it off. What's that? Silage. It stinks! Like the dirt between my toes. You get toe-jam? Don't you? I'll check next bath. What? Someone... saw me. Arakawa... He made me... do him like the Rector. Come on, Toru... who cares if you got caught with your dick in your hand? You don't understand... how hard it was for me to tell you that. Toru! Komiya or Arakawa... who should I get first? No, thanks. Then why tell me? For sympathy. You might not care... but not taking care of things bothers me. This is my business... Yeah? Yes. I'll do something. He's pretty, isn't he? A very pretty boy. Teach him. What? Shake hands. I'm pregnant. Arakawa died... because he made me fellate him. Go to bed. You did it. You won. Did I really? Big-time! Don't cry... But it's you, praising me! Hey! What are you up to? You hate this! No, I hate doing it for Arakawa and the Rector. I want to do it for you. Toru! Hey! Toru! I want to. May l? 'May l'? Look, Toru... I won't do it back for you. I'm not expecting that. Toru! Hey... you said dirt collects between your toes, didn't you? Yes. Why? If you've got some, I'd like to sniff it. It's filthy. I want to. It smells like silage. It does? Smells aren't good or evil. Let's get back to the shit.
