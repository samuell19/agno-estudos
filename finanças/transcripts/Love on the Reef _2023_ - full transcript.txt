Have a good day, guys. Good morning, Pete! Dr. Waters, how are ya? I'm good, how are you? Oh, baby watch has officially started, hasn't it? I know, I'm gonna be a grandfather, can you believe it? I can't, I'm so excited for you! - Next. - Hey. Can I get two black coffees, please? Sure! That'll be $7.13. It's been six months since Bay Cove's very own and world-renowned surfer, Liam Smith, threw the surf community for a loop, throwing in the towel the same day that he nearly won the Pipeline Masters. While we are speculating as to why, our sources can confirm that Liam, as of today, has not gotten back on the board. Excuse me, Mr. Smith, can I get your autograph? Yeah, of course. - What's your name? - Ally. Ally, A-L-L-Y? However you want to spell it. Thank you. You got it, have a great day. You too! Connie, hey! Hello to our surf world bad boy! I've been trying to get a hold of you for days, where have you been? You know, just livin', laughing. As you should be. Listen, did you get my message about the competition? Yeah, I did. I think I'm gonna have to pass on that one. Pass? You're basically guaranteed to win if you compete. Just think about it, would you? No, no, no, I want to talk to him! Hey, I gotta run. Could you post one of those pictures I sent you? Gotta keep that image up. Bye. - Ah! - Who are you? Who are you? I asked first, why are you on my boat? I'm Dr. Waters, and this is my boat! Look what you made me do! I didn't make you do anything, and no, this is my boat. Base, this is Dr. Waters. There's a suspicious person on my boat... Base, there is a suspicious person on my boat. Hey, what's going on here? Who are you? I'm one of the Marine Institute's divemasters. - Who are you? - I'm... beginning to believe I might be on the wrong boat. Oh, really? I think you dropped this. Oh, thank you, thank you! All right! Wait, you're that guy, right? That surfer guy? I think that you're confusing me with some other very handsome guy. Anyway, this has been fun, but I gotta run. Swim. That was weird. Thank you for this. Hey! Mm, hey! - Here you go! - Thank you! Cardboard straw. Yup, Rise and Grind took your words to heart. No more plastic straws. Mm! You get used to it. It's worth it if it's for the reef. Dr. Maris! I noticed in your last report - you're close to a breakthrough. - Mhm. What you've got here, Dr. Waters, something that could reverse coral bleaching would be massive for the ecological community. The Board was very impressed with the idea. The Board? You showed the Board? I may have given them a sneak preview. - And? - I have a feeling they're gonna choose a certain top marine biologist for the spot. Wait, you're not talking about Nancy, right? Because she is brilliant. I'm talking about you. The Board has had its eye on you for years. This is the natural next step. Thank you. Mhm. Now, your 12 o'clock is here. Oh, great! Thank you. Thought that was gonna be the WaterLight display. Well, it was, but in order for us to keep our green certification, we can only sell environmentally safe products. Okay. How'd it go today? Absolutely pointless. But you got in the water. Yeah. Your agent called today. She called you? I guess you got an offer to be a judge at this year's Pipeline Masters. And what'd you tell her? That you'd call her back! This could be a good opportunity, a comeback! I'm not looking for a comeback, Dad. I don't need a comeback. Diving is fine, working with you guys is fine, I'm fine. It's all fine. - Dad? - Hm? What's this? Oh. It's nothing. Dad. It's all under control, Liam. Yeah, well, that didn't look under control. Had a few tough months. Let me help you guys out. I know starting a business in this market... Everything is fine, son. I have to have some equipment washed down. Do you mind holding the fort while I go do that? Yeah. Hey! Hey! - What are you working on? - Nothing. Did inspiration for the Wallston Art School - application finally strike? - I'm just doodling. Seriously, it's nothing. You know what you should do? One of me, but as a Grecian mermaid. That would absolutely impress the Admissions Council! You sound like Dad. Yeah, 'cause we're both geniuses. Speaking of Dad, we need to get to dinner. Yes. Let's go! Okay, what about one of me but as a real estate agent for aquatic properties like Atlantis? Are we brainstorming ideas about Brooke's grad school application? We are, and if I do say so myself, it is going very well. I cannot with you two. She just doesn't understand genius. That's what I said. Whatcha got there, Dad? Oh, I found these up in the attic. Your mother must've put them up there and forgot about 'em. I thought you each should take one. I have your mother's art hanging all over my house. - Thanks. - I love that, thanks, Dad! Oh, sounds like dinner's ready! Got it, got it, got it! How about me as a pirate, but on a sunken ship? Ooh, I love that, like a mer-pirate! Mhm! Um, yup, that's it. That's the winner! Done. - I mean, I think it's brilliant. - Mhm! It is a masterpiece waiting to be brought to life. Great! Yes! Thank you! Who was that? Dr. Maris over at the Marine Institute. We are officially the new temporary divemasters. And if it all goes well, this could lead to a full-time contract, which means that... The shop will be able to stay open? I may or may not have done some snooping. Yeah, things have been a little tight recently. But this is exactly what we need. Now let's get this place locked up, because you have an early dive in the morning. Sounds good. Well, I think it's great, honey. - What's great? - Hey! Hey! Isla turned in her grant application for her Save the Reef project today. Which means your experiment worked. Almost. I've found a way to help the coral regenerate, but we're not seeing the long-term effects that we'd like, so I need the grant, and I'm hoping that Mayor Wade will overlook the fact that I'm your daughter. I have no idea what you're talking about. Dad and Mayor Wade have had this competition thing for like the last 20 years. They're exaggerating. Literally since high school, they have competed for everything. - The scholarship. - Dad won. - The valedictorian spot. - Mayor Wade won! Dad beat out Mayor Wade for Bay Cove's best pie at this year's summer bake sale. And the year before. But there is no competition there. No, none. You know, they spend so much time thinking about each other, you'd think they were secretly in love. Sorry. Hey, I just got a new client meeting. Congratulations! And make sure you save room for dessert, because I made pie. Wait, what kind? Dutch apple, your favorite. Do you believe in soul mates? You mean those two? Mhm. Yeah, absolutely. Why, do you not? I think it's a nice idea in theory, but something about it seems so unattainable. I mean, statistically speaking, the odds of finding someone that you'll like for that extended period of time are astronomically low. Honey, some things you can't look at with a scientific eye. Sometimes you just gotta go with the flow, see where it takes you. I've never done that. I know you haven't. Marsha! Mayor Wade. To what do I owe the pleasure? I think I'm your nine o'clock. Uh, not unless you're Kenzie Robey. That would be my assistant. She must have given you her name. And she did give you the right specs. These are beautiful. I mean, the color scheme of the cushions is all wrong. It's an easy fix. Flower choice is impractical. Adjustable. The seating area that's here is not quite right. Nothing we can't tweak. But I don't hate it. Oh, isn't that a glowing review. Hey, Dad, I brought you a coffee. Uh, Mayor Wade, hi. Um, what's up? Mayor Wade is my new potential client. Oh, well, that's unexpected. On many levels. I have to say, I've been shopping for landscape architects for months. No one's gotten my vision the way you have. I'll send you my notes tomorrow morning. I'm looking forward to your pitch at the municipal grant funds hearing, Dr. Waters. Your Save the Reef project sounds very intriguing. Thank you! Uh, what just happened? I have no idea. Dr. Waters. Paging Dr. Isla Waters, your boat is ready! You know you don't have to call me Dr. Waters. I'm proud of my sister, the PhD. Paging Dr. Waters. I'll let the divemaster know you're on your way. Thank you. Hey, Pete, I... You. And you. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Why are you just repeating what I'm saying? I'm not, I'm just asking questions. That happen to be the same ones you're asking. I'm the new divemaster. You? You're joking. Serious as a shark attack. You can't even tell which boat is yours, how are you gonna be my backup on the open water? Looks like you're just gonna have to trust me, Doc. Give me a minute. Bay Cove Aquarium. Brooke. Isla? What's wrong? Where's Pete? Is he okay? Oh, yeah. His daughter went into labor a little early, so he had to leave, why? How long will he be gone? A month. Why? Do you know who the new divemaster is? Um, Liam something, right? Yeah, Liam Smith, that surfer guy that went MIA after last year's Pipeline Masters? Oh, my gosh. Yes! Wait, wait, he's our new divemaster? Uh-huh. It looks like his shop was the only one on the approved list from the Board that had the availability, so if you want to go out to the reef in the next month, he's your only option. Okay, thank you. Ready, Doc? Yes, but I'm navigating. What's wrong, Doc? I think I forgot my hat. Oh, I have one. It would look really good on you. What is this? A hat. So what are we going out for? No, thank you, I got it. Um, we are not going out for anything. I am going out to collect samples, and you are driving. And protecting your face from the sun. I will have you know that this hat is for emergencies only. What are you doing? Going diving. No, no, the divemaster stays on the boat in case I have any problems. Yeah, but your other guy dove with you. That was different. How? It just was. Don't worry, Doc, I'll keep the radio on me. That's not how this works. Sorry, I'm not done loading... I'm not done loading that yet. Thanks for the charter. Yeah, well, it's my job now. Speaking of, how did a world-renowned surfer become a boat driver for scientists? Just riding the wave of life, I guess. Hey, so those photos you were taking, what are they for? Just keeping tabs on what's going on down there. That spot peaked my interest a couple months ago. Uh, could you send them to me? I'm putting together a pitch for the municipal funds grant, and they could be really helpful. It is him. Liam? Hey, how's it going? Hey, can I please have your autograph? Yeah, of course. What are your names? - I'm Riley. - Sarah. Riley and Sarah, it's a pleasure to meet you. You are my favorite surfer! Do you think we could get a selfie? - Yeah, of course! - Thank you, thank you. - Here, you want me to take it? - Yeah. Or actually, here, why don't you snap it, Doc? Are you serious? Yeah, of course. Come on. Thank you! Yay, thank you! Thank you, hope to see you back on the board soon! Have a nice day! Bet that never gets old. You know, it doesn't, no Okay, so about those photos. Yeah, listen, I'm gonna need something in return for them, Doc. You give my diving services a glowing review. From the dive we just took? Yeah, my parents are up for one of the full-time contracts with you guys, which would be pretty rad for all parties involved. Sure, I won't tell Dr. Maris that you dove with me, that you spent company time taking selfies with your fans, or about your incredibly annoying attitude. Great, then the pics are yours! Speaking of, do you want a selfie with me? Content featuring my face does very well on other people's social media pages. I don't do social media, but thanks. If you could just send the photos to the email address on this card, that would be fantastic. Aye-aye, Captain! Thank you! Dr. Waters. Good afternoon, Dr. Waters. We received your application for the municipal funds grant, but you were missing a section. I was? Yes, it looks like you were working from an old application. The guidelines for the grant changed six months ago. Everything else on your application is correct, it's just missing the portion about the 100 community members voting at the hearing. I can process your application without the information of your 100 community members, but we can't hear your cause without their votes. Okay, yes, go ahead and process the application. The 100 required voters will be in attendance. Mhm. Yes, we have field trips every day, including the weekends. Yes, they... I'm gonna have to put you on a brief hold. - What's wrong? - What are you doing on the 30th? Uh, something very important that you need me for? So it turns out I need 100 community members to come vote at the hearing in order to have our cause heard. Okay, how many do you have signed up? Well, that section wasn't on the application that I was working from. Um, okay. Do you know what you need? A spokesperson. Someone to get the word out, get people excited to support. What do you think I've been doing? Right, and you've been doing a great job, but do you remember when you were trying to get people involved with your project and you hosted that Games and Gills night instead of knocking on doors and maybe like five people showed up? Well, six, if you count Dad. My point exactly. And that was with the Marine Institute's directory of contacts. This endeavor, as valiant as it is, has historically not had the best turn out. So if you want people to commit their time, you need to give them something to get excited about! Just a thought. Oh! Like that dog that skateboards! Sparky would get people excited. Sparky. Go call Sparky's agent. Call Sparky's agent. Is that something I can find online, the phone number? You think it's... Yeah, you'll find it! - All right. - Thank you for holding. Thank you. Hi, my name is Dr. Isla Waters and I'm calling on behalf of the Save the Reef project at the Bay Cove Marine Institute. I'm interested in booking Sparky for a few days. $3,000 for one day? Okay, I'm gonna have to circle back with you. Thanks. Change your mind about that selfie, Doc? Absolutely not. Listen, what if I told you there was a way that I could guarantee your family the contract? I'm listening. You know that stuff is really bad for the environment, right? Like it could kill off entire ecosystems of micro bacteria? I was told that it's safe for human use. That doesn't mean it's safe for the beings we share the planet with. Well, I'm building an empire! Wait, are you sponsored by them? Liam, you have a platform. People in this community care what you have to say, and you're using it to sell that? That isn't just anything, that is WaterLight. It turns any water that it touches into medical grade cleaner. There are not enough hours in the day for me to break down how incredibly problematic that sentence was. I was gonna ask you to be the spokesperson of the Save the Reef project, help me get people committed to come vote in exchange for making your family one of our permanent divemasters. However, upon reflection, I now realize that that was the wrong move. Goodbye. Isla, Isla, Isla, Isla, wait. Okay, that is Dr. Waters to you. Okay, sorry, Dr. Waters. I'm in, I want to do it, be the spokesperson for your Save the Reef thing in exchange for the contract. While that is incredibly generous, the offer is no longer on the table, so... I am not above pushing you off of this dock and into the water if you do not get out of my way. As much as I would love to see you try, I just did my hair, so. What would you need me to do as a spokesperson? Hypothetically, I would need you to help me get people committed to come vote at the hearing on municipal funds on the 30th. That's it? I could totally do that. I know you can. Which is why I asked. Well, technically, you didn't ask, I offered. Are you always this infuriating? Only to the people that I really like. Great. Goodbye. Okay, I think that we may have gotten off on the wrong fin. "Fin." Was that a fish pun? I'm Liam Smith, professional surfer, and I don't normally do this, but I would like to help. Okay, look, I didn't know that those products were bad for the environment. They just offered me a lot of money. Okay, look, I've noticed the changes at the reef, too. If we lose the reef, my parents are gonna lose their business. Let's do a trial run. Meet me at Ocean Park at nine A.M. sharp. You got it, Doc. Maybe don't call me that. Connie, hey. I was just wondering if you'd had a chance to reconsider. Connie... I know, I know. I'm just trying to keep you relevant in the surf world. Anyways, the new WaterLight contract should be in your inbox this week, so this is super hush-hush, but they're planning on opening a new packaging plant right there in Bay Cove. The PR team loves this hometown thing you've got going on, and they want to put you on a billboard right on Main Street. Right, right. While that is technically super cool, and I would love to be on a billboard in my hometown and show the people that I really made it, I'm not sure this is the kind of thing I want my face plastered next to. Well, it's a little too late for that, isn't it? I've done some reading on WaterLight, and this stuff's not good at all for the environment. That's nonsense, that's all just hearsay. What really matters is that the check clears, and boy, did that check clear. All right, well, the contract with them ends this week, you know, maybe we don't re-up and we find another partnership. When the new WaterLight contract comes in, we'll chat about it. Oh, whoops. Getting another call. Gotta go. Don't be a stranger. - Morning, Doc! - Good morning! So what are we doing here? We are here to get people signed up to come support us at the hearing in a few days. Twelve! Cool. We need how many? A hundred. So I was thinking that you could introduce yourself, say your role in the cause, get people excited to show up. This is Daphne, the Director of Community Events. It is a pleasure to meet you, Liam. - We are big fans. - Thank you! My son and I cannot wait to see you back up on the board. All right, um, shall we get started? Yeah, I'll just... I'll make a quick intro and then the floor is all yours. Sounds good. Great, so if we just stick to the script, I think we should be able to get a few people to commit to come show up and vote. - Okay! - Yeah. "It is our esteemed honor to invite you to participate in a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to show your support for this incredibly sacred endeavor on which we are embarking." I'm not gonna read this. What? Why not? Come on, the back of a cereal box is more interesting than this. We need to get people excited, you know, make them feel included in the mission. All right, good morning, Bay Cove! Woo! And welcome to the 25th annual community summer field day! Now, before the games begin, I have a quick announcement. We have a very special guest with us who has a worthy cause and needs our help, so please welcome four-time Pipeline winner, Liam Smith! Wait, don't you need these? What up, Bay Cove, how you doing today? When I say "Liam," you say, "Smith." Liam! - Smith! - Liam! - Smith! - Liam! - Smith! - Liam! Smith! Now that is what I'm talking about! Okay, listen, I need your help, are you guys ready? Is it true that you're hosting the Pipeline Masters this year? I heard you're judging it. Nothing's decided yet. Now... When's your book coming out and are you gonna surf again? Potentially. Now, uh, back to the reef. There's a hearing coming up on the 30th that we would love for you guys to come out and vote at Town Hall. How's that sound? Can... I have your autograph? Yeah, sure. Uh... all right, Liam. Uh, let the games begin! Come on, everybody, let's go! I think that went well. Did it, though? We need to get all of these people to agree to vote and then have them actually show up to do it. All right. I have an idea. What? - Absolutely not. - Why not? Because, Liam, now is not the time for a break. No, but now is the time to get some attention for winning. It works every time. No! Come on, just one game, Doc. If we lose, we can call it a day and we go back to your way of doing things. But if we win, we do things my way. Unless you're scared. Scared? Of losing in front of the whole town? I'm not scared. Then let's do this, Doc! Come on. - Okay, fine. - Yes! Okay. All right, everybody. It is time for the Bay Cove Challenge! So grab a partner, find a station, let the games begin. All right, here we go. Okay. Oh, good job, good job! - Are you any good? - Are you? Touché. So, underhand, overhand? It'll be overhand. Why don't you show me? - Okay. - It was close. Nice! Nice! There you go! It's okay, it's okay. Okay. One more, and then we get back to work. Unless we win. Unless we win. I think that we're gonna win this, Doc. Any "fin" is possible. Was that another fish pun? All right, everybody, it is time for the baton race! Runners, you ready? Get set go! Whoo, he's fast! Come on, Isla! Go, go, go! Whoo! All right! You did it, Doc! The winners are Isla and Liam! Congratulations! That was great! That was great! Go, Isla, whoo! They're going down. Ooh, is the doc feeling competitive? What? No. No! It's... it's for the reef, for the reef. All right! Here we go. On your marks, go! Let's go, Doc! Let's go! Oh! Congratulations! We did it! Isla... Isla and Liam are the winners! - Lemme get this. - Thank you. Okay, that was fun, but we didn't actually get anybody signed up. Excuse me, guys. My wife and I would love to show support for the reef by voting at the hearing. - Oh! - Yeah, just, uh, just put in your name and your contact info, and then you hit "submit" and the details on how to vote will be emailed to you. - Well, there. - Great. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. Thank you. Have a good day. Whoo-hoo! What? I was right. It worked. You got two people signed up. Yeah, but it's more than you had before. So, my job here is basically done. What? No, no, you are committed to this cause until all 100 people are signed up to come vote at the hearing. Otherwise, I'm not gonna push you guys through for the contract. Are you always this literal? Excuse me? I'm... I'm joking, Doc! Of course, I know that two people isn't enough. Lighten up a little bit, okay? It didn't sound like a joke. That's because you don't have a sense of humor. Well, that's extremely rude. Can't help it if the truth hurts, Doc. We need to come up with a better strategy if we're gonna get all 100 people signed up to vote at the hearing. All right. Well, uh... I'll think of something, okay? See you later, Doc. Sorry, what does "think of something". We only have a couple of days! - Uh, Isla? - Yeah? You have a visitor. What can I do for you, Liam? I had a couple ideas I wanted to run by you. Please have a seat. As the face of this movement, I was thinking that we could do a fish fry where everybody dresses up as sea creatures. Or, or a water-based obstacle course that ends in a balloon fight. "Gill" -iant, right? Hm. Does that enthusiastic reaction mean yes or does it mean no? No, Liam. Contentless flash will not get people to come vote at the hearing. It will entertain them for an afternoon and that's it. I tried. Okay, please don't touch anything. Okay, stop, stop, stop. What's this over here? It is the reason the votes are so important. This formula could be a game changer for conservation efforts, but I need more funding to finish it. How's it work? Basically, it replenishes the coral's food supply and stops it from bleaching. Stabilizes it and makes it less susceptible to environmental factors. Wow. That's really impressive. Yeah, we're seeing some really promising results. I mean, it's only about 65% effective right now, hence... Why you need the grant money. Precisely. Precisely. - Just... - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Who's this cutie? Uh, that's my mom. She did everything she could to help the reef thrive. She knew that without it, none of this matters. And I wanna leave a legacy behind like that as well, one where I do everything I can to make the world a better place. How much do you know about coral bleaching? I can confidently say that any previous knowledge on that topic was not retained. Great. Well, come on. As the "face" of the movement, you can help me get people signed up at this demonstration. Bring all of that wondrous charm. Follow my lead. Okay, but you didn't even hear my dunk tank idea. - Is everybody ready? - Yeah! The coral reef. It is a bright and vibrant landscape that is home to many species and protects our coasts. But when the coral gets stressed, it expels zooxanthellae, the tissue that gives the coral its bright color, and it causes it to bleach, which disrupts the entire ecosystem and sets off a chain of events that affects everything, including you and me. Which is why it is so important for us to protect our oceans and the aquatic beings that call it home. Ooh! Does anybody have any questions? Me! Me! Me! Great. Uh, Ben. What's faster, a marlin or a dolphin? A marlin. Who's next? Me! Me! Me! Mia. Do seahorses live outside salt water? So there are over 50 species of seahorses, and yes, some of them can live in brackish water. - Anybody else? - Me! Me! Me! Mila. So how'd you do? Uh, three. You? Four. Ooh, look at you, Doc! Oh! - Oh... that's okay. - Sorry. Um... My bad. It's okay, it happens all the time. My mom worked here on weekends when I was growing up, and I used to pack a lunch and just sit and watch them swim. When I was growing up, my friends used to hate swimming with me, 'cause they said I'd go underwater and I wouldn't come back up. All good? Yeah, it's just my agent, it's nothing. Doesn't sound like nothing. I'm trying to get out of my situation with WaterLight. But your empire! It's not worth it if it harms any of this. You know, I used to wanna be a marine biologist when I grew up, before surfing kinda took over my life over the past decade, but... now, I don't know, I'm just trying to figure out if there's still space for it. Sounds to me like a classic identity crisis. Well, you are the doctor. I say that... if you want surfing to be part of your life again, then make surfing part of your life again. You ever surf before? Um, negative. You wanna learn? Not really. - You sure? - Very. Really? I feel like learning how to surf from a former pipeline champion is, like, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It seems like you really wanna teach me how to surf. I kinda do. Just for the satisfaction of seeing you fall off the board. You know what? I would love to learn to surf. Oh. Mm-hm. I'll make you a deal. If you get us to 45 committed community members by the end of the day, I will let you teach me how to surf. You have yourself a deal. And I will see you in the morning, Doc. We'll see about that. We will see about that. We will see about that. We will see about that. What's up, Connie? Liam, where have you been? Have you seen the new WaterLight contract? I told you that I wanna pass. As your agent, I cannot advise you to do that. Well, as my agent, I'm asking you to do it. I don't wanna work with them anymore, Connie. I don't think that's really an option here, Liam. They've already put a bid in for the land for the distribution site and have purchased the billboard space. Well, there are better brands out there that we can partner with. WaterLight was the only brand to offer you a sponsorship, Liam. Great. Then I won't be sponsored. What has gotten into you, Liam? People listen to what I have to say. I need to be careful with who and what I'm promoting. Not when they're offering you six-figure contracts, you don't. Look, I'm not signing that contract, Connie. The partnership is over. You're making a huge mistake. You know, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel like I'm doing the right thing. Pass on the contract. Thank you, Connie. Hey. Whoa, Jumpy McGee, what you working on there? - Uh, nothing. - Brooke, that is not nothing. - That is beautiful. - They're just... they're just doodles. Brooke! Brooke, I love this. You know what? It might be cool to use these as branding for the pitch. It could maybe give us an edge. Well, I... could create a logo using that design, if you want. That would be amazing. Thank you. And in return, I can offer you surf lessons from a world-renowned surfer. I told Liam that if he got 45 people committed to vote by the end of the day that I would let him teach me how to surf. You didn't think he could do it, did you? No, I didn't. But I'm not gonna give him the satisfaction of knowing that, so I need you and Charlie to come and help distract from my lack of coordination and athletic ability. - You got it, sis. - Thank you. Those are beautiful. I can't wait to see the logo. - Morning. - Morning. Um... just felt like giving it a wax? I'm teaching a lesson, actually. A surfing lesson? Yeah. Well, that sounds like fun. Yeah. I think it will be. Oh, and I, uh, I reached out to everyone on Mom's contact list, got us to 45. I'm, uh, I'm still waiting to hear back from the Wilsons and the Wends, but, uh, there's this thing tomorrow night, a charity event for the Small Business Association. That might be a good place to get more people committed to vote. SBA loves this kind of thing. That is a great idea. Thanks, Dad. All right, thank you so much. All the voting info will be emailed to you guys, okay? Have a nice day. Hey! This is my sister Brooke and her husband Charlie. - Hi. Nice to meet you, man. - Yeah. - Heard a lot about you. - Nice to meet you. Uh... so let's go check out the surf, bae, all right? Is there a problem? No problem at all. Good. Let's learn to surf. Let's do it. I got the boards over here. Okay. All right, so you're gonna start on your belly, and you're gonna paddle like this, and then, when you feel the pull of the wave, pop up. You pop and glide, all right? Now, don't worry if you don't get up your first time. Most people don't. And usually, the hand that you write with is gonna be the foot that goes in back for stability, but I'm the opposite and surf goofy, so mine goes in front. Well, that's fitting. Obviously, we're just learning here, so I was thinking we could give it a couple rounds in the land, then give it a quick go in the water. All right, who wants to go first? Um... we'll meet you in the water. - Yeah, let's do that. - I thought that you guys di... Have a good time, guys. Oh, I forgot to tell you that they already know how to surf. So you made me give them that whole demonstration thinking that they were newbies and you knew that they weren't. Uh, maybe. All right, so I'm gonna just... Hey, this was your idea. If you wanna give up, I'm happy to go back to the lab. We start with a paddle, all right? Okay, we're paddlin'. - Paddle. - Okay. All right, here it comes. You feel the wave pulling you, and then you pop up. Did I do it? Yeah, Doc. You nailed it. I'm gonna just... I'll do it... I'll do it one more time. Yeah, one more time. We're gonna get that balance thing squared away. Oh, well that's probably never gonna happen, but it's worth a shot. So we're back on the board and we're paddling. - Paddling. - And we're paddling fast. So how did you do it? Do what? Get the 45 to commit that quickly? What can I say, Doc? People love a local celebrity. No, I called in every single favor I could with every single person I could get a hold of and begged them to come. But hey. It worked. Yeah. It did. I, uh, ended my partnership with WaterLight yesterday. You did? I mean, the relationship had run its course. Does this have anything to do with what I said? That the products are bad for the environment? No. I'm just ready for a change. So what are you gonna do now? Keep helping my parents run the dive shop, I guess. Maybe start surfing again? This is my first time back on a board since my accident. What happened, anyway? If you don't mind me asking. Usually, in the past, when I fell, I would just get back on the board, you know? The faster the better, but... that last one got to me. What was different about it? When I first started surfing, it was like my way of processing things. Like, nothing was too hard when I was out on the waves. I could just clear my mind, find a way to solve any problem. And the bigger the problem or the madder I got, the harder I'd push myself. But then I started to get attention for it, which led to my image... The "bad boy" thing. Exactly. But, you know, I'm a different person now. So what was different about that last fall? Well, I tried to get back on the board like I always do, but for some reason, I couldn't. And that, compounded with the shame of the actual fall, was a lot. So I walked away. And I know... I know I'm gonna surf again. I just... I know it'll have to be as a different version of myself. So how do you feel now? I was expecting to feel something big. Like terror or joy or something. But instead, you realized you're hollow inside? Yes, Doc. Hollow. No, I feel, uh... I feel calm. Yeah. Like coming home. It's not easy but it's familiar. That's really poetic. If you had told me the reason that I'd be getting back on the board was because I was working with a scientist on what is basically a grown-up group project, then I'd tell you you're insane. Well, sometimes life can surprise you. Ain't that the truth. All right, you two. Play nice! We will. Thanks for coming, guys! I gotta say, Doc, you looked pretty good out there. Oh yeah, thanks. Once I found my sea legs, really, uh... loved it? Yes!! Liam, Liam! - Can we get a photo? - Yeah, of course. We're going to the billboard reveal on the 30th. We can't wait. Thanks again! Bye! What was that all about? I have no idea. I wonder what's going on there. We've been petitioning the city to protect that land for months. Why? I'll show you. So, these turtles, they're endangered. And this is their favorite nesting spot, so if this land sells, it could mean some big problems for them. Hey. I got an idea. You thirsty? Yeah? I haven't drank straight from the coconut since I was a kid. Then you've been missing out on years of the best water on the Florida coast. My mom used to say the same thing. You know, this Save the Reef project is exactly the sort of thing she used to do. She was on the board at the Marine Institute. A founding member, actually. Wow. I'm hoping to follow in her footsteps with a board seat. She's what inspired me to become a marine biologist. It's funny how parents will do that to you. Yeah. So there's this, uh, this charity event that my parents go to every single year. It's tomorrow, hosted by the Small Business Association. That's cool. And I was thinking, you know, maybe it'd be cool if we went, we mingled, we get some people to sign up to come to the hearing. That's... a really good idea. Was that a compliment? Absolutely not. I'll talk to Brooke, see if she can get us some materials made up. Yeah, this, this doesn't exactly scream, "Let's change the world." Okay, I was in a hurry and I will ask Brooke to fix it. Good, because this is terrible. So how long have you been working on your little experiment thingie? "Experiment thingy"? You know what I mean. Uh, about two years. I came up with the idea while I was on a dive in school, and the idea's just been rolling around in the back of my brain ever since. And then, when I learned that the board was opening up a new seat to a candidate with a fully funded research project, I got to work. And now, here we are, trying to get the grant from the municipal funds hearing. I'm worried that the committee is gonna look down on my product because it's not 100% effective, but I'm trying to get it up to at least 90% effectiveness by the hearing. Which, speaking of, I need to get back to the lab. I'm testing out a new phylo substance on the coral today. Sounds exceptionally nerdy. But potentially world-changing! I'll see you tomorrow. - What's up, Mom? - Hey, honey. Did you go surfing today? Just taught a lesson. Anyway, is that ticket to the charity event still on the table? I think we can make that happen. What about two? - Two? - Yeah, one for me and one for Dr. Waters. Look, it's a long story, Mom. Can we make two tickets happen? - Sure, absolutely. - Cool. - Hey. - Don't look! Okay. Making something for me? I won't know until it's finished. Coast is clear... What is going on? Oh. Mayor Wade is Dad's new client. And apparently, it's going pretty well. - So, huge favor to ask. - Huh-huh. Well, two favors, technically. One: How hard would it be to make a new information page for when people sign up to vote at the hearing? Oh, not hard at all. What are we working with? Yeah, that is bad. That's why I need your help. All right, if that's one, what's two? So Liam invited me to this charity event thing, and I was wondering if we could have some materials made up to hand out. What kind of things? Like pamphlets, info packets, that kinda thing? Yeah, absolutely. When do you need 'em? Tomorrow? Tomorrow tomorrow. Yes. Great. Sure! Absolutely, I can do that. Thank you, thank you, thank you... Well, if it gets you that spot on the board finally, it'll be worth it. Thank you. No prob. So. This morning was fun. What? Surfing! With Liam. You know, when he started at the Institute, I thought for sure you two would kill each other. Uh, yeah, we definitely did not start off - on the right fin. - Fin? Foot. Did you just make a fish pun? Uh, Liam must be rubbing off on me. Uh-huh. - What? - Nothing! It's just nice seeing you like this. Like what? Relaxed. Chill. - I'm always chill. - Yes, I know, but... there is something different. You seem happier. Do not read into it, it is a good thing. Whatever you say. I will see you soon. - All right. - Thank you. I love you. I love you. - You are the best. - I know. Dr. Waters. Oh, Dr. Maris. Hi! - How's it going? - Uh, good. I'm just working on my presentation, and it's going really well, actually. The data is solid and the plan of action is thoroughly researched. All we need is the 100 community members in attendance, and with our new spokesperson, I actually think that that might happen. About that. The board is a bit hesitant about the involvement of Liam Smith. What? Why? His past partnerships have raised some concerns. They're worried he might be sending the wrong message. I understand your hesitancy, and to be honest, I shared it. But Liam is completely on board with the mission. He's given up his WaterLight contract, he's invested in the reef. I hope you're right, Isla. If not, you could have hitched your horse to the wrong wagon. Liam can be trusted. I'm sure of it. Great. I look forward to the hearing and your presentation to the board. - Thank you. - Mm-hm. Oh, uh, Dr. Maris. Do you know anything about the sale of the land at Pebble Beach? No, I don't. Why? There was a pending for sale sign there. Let me look into it. - Okay. Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey. Did you go surfing this morning? What prompted that? I don't know, just... felt like time, I guess. Really proud of you, son. Oh, you know, we've got a dive with Dr. Waters - in 15 minutes. - Oh, I can handle it. - Are you sure? Cause I... - No, no, no, no. I got it. All right. And I'll see you soon. Have a great dive! Hey! - One, um, your boat is ready. - Thank you. And two... I have a surprise for you. Can you stop by my studio before the charity event? Yeah, sure. Have a nice dive. Thanks, sis. I'm Mr. Seahorse. Yee-haw! Yee-haw! And I'm Mr. Octopus. You make me nervous and I ink. Pew! Pew! You like the octopus? Here you go. He's all yours, but if you promise to keep him safe, okay? All right, go run on back to your parents. Hey. Is everything okay? You were serious, right, about ending your contract with WaterLight? No, Doc, I just agreed to sell them my life rights. Of course I was serious. Why? I guess the board is feeling hesitant about you being the face of our cause, what with that partnership being... Environmentally damaging and very off-brand for a wildlife-based cause? - Exactly. - Look, I totally get it, but seriously, you have nothing to worry about. As much as it pains me to admit it, you were right, okay? I got a platform and I should be using it for things that matter. Like, uh, saving the reef. All right, Doc? Let's do it. Do you always park this far out? All the boats should be parked out this far. We all gotta try to be better about leaving no trace. Which is why I mistook your boat for mine. You were parked in my eco-friendly spot. What's the story with that? Well, I made that right after I became a certified dive instructor. I found that when I take people out, there tend to be nerves, especially in kids and first-time divers. And, uh, well, these guys here help them to relax and remind them that this is supposed to be fun, ya know? So I've had it with me ever since. All right. I'll be right here if you need me, Doc. You're not diving with me? Well, it's the divemaster's job to make sure that the diver is safe. But you have a radio. So, I don't see the harm in you coming with me. After you, Doc. Let's do this thing. All right, I will see you tonight. See ya tonight. Connie, hey. Well, hello to my favorite surfer! Alright, everything is good to go for your extension with WaterLight, and good news, your billboard will officially debut tomorrow. Hopefully it will give your mayor the push he needs to sign off on that packaging plant. What are you talking about? I told you! WaterLight's new packaging plant in Bay Cove and the hometown billboard to promote! You're the face of the fastest growing cleaning product in North America! I don't want to continue the partnership, Connie. That's not... Look, I don't have anything more to say than that. I understand you're going through an identity crisis but this deal is bigger than that, so I went around you, Liam. Sorry to say it but somebody's got to save your career and it's looking like it's not going to be you. My career doesn't need saving. Shred the contract, Connie. We can't. We've reached a verbal agreement with them, Liam. If we don't move forward they'd be well within their right to sue. I know this is hard for you, but I'm just trying to keep the door open to the world of pro surfing so whenever you've worked out whatever it is you need to work out, you have a career to come back to. - Hey. - Hey! Do you know what this is all about? - I have no idea. You? - No idea. Great, glad we're on the same page. Hey, guys! Thank you all for coming. As you know, Isla gave me free rein on the design for the Small Business Association event tonight, which you will not regret, hopefully. Uh... Okay, close your eyes. Just... She always does this, doesn't she? Every single time. Anyway, I wanted to create something timeless and special for the charity event and my mind kept coming back to Mom's painting. Alright, three, two, one, open! What do you guys think? Oh my gosh, you guys hate it. No, no. It's stunning! It's absolutely incredible. Um, everything is printed and ready to go. I even had stickers made, I mean, because who doesn't love a sticker, right? I was worried I had gone too far finishing Mom's painting. No. No. I'm so glad you did. You know, you girls make up the best parts of her. You know, she would be so proud of the women you grew up to be. You two have given your mother another chance to be a part of the efforts to saving one of her favorite places. I love you so much. I love you too. - Hey. - Hey! Look at you. Don't you clean up nice. Right back at ya, Doc. Was that a compliment? Absolutely not. - Isla, there's something that... - So I... Sorry, ladies first. What's this? To replace the one you gave away this morning. We can't have the emergency hat lacking in backup. So what was it that you wanted to tell me? Um, it can wait until tomorrow. Are you sure? Shall we get going? - Yeah. - After you. Thank you, thank you. This is a beautiful house. Thank you. Oh, Liam. Look at this. Look at this. Yeah, don't worry, Brooke made sure we were covered. - What? - You sign right here. I may or may not have been in on the surprise. Hey! Thank you for holding down the fort. Happy to. You must be Dr. Waters. - I'm Lana and this is Kevin. - Hi! Nice to meet you, Doctor. Nice to meet you. And please call me Isla. My mom and my dad. Hey, thanks again for setting up. It's our pleasure. So nice to meet you. You as well. This looks beautiful. Thank you again. This is amazing. - Check this out. - Wait, Liam, when did we get up to 87 confirmed voters? Turns out that my parents would have made a better spokesperson than me. I told them about the cause and they were happy to help. - Shall we get to work? - Please. Uh, you take that side, I'll take this side. Sounds good, Doc. Hi, you guys have a moment to talk about our local reef? All right, thank you so much. We'll see you tomorrow. Thanks, guys. That looks like fun. You know what? It does. You thinking what I'm thinking? Are you thinking dancing? I'm thinking dancing. Yeah. Let's dance. Okay, so you got any moves? Yeah, I got this one right here, it's called the Thumbs to the Side. Oh, I like that one. This is almost like disco. - The Isla Waters. - Isla Waters? Isla Waters, like the ocean. - That's called the Robot. - I know it. Can I have this dance, Doc? I would love that. You know, when I first met you I thought you were this know-it-all, fussy perfectionist who didn't have any fun. But I was wrong. You're not so bad yourself. You know, I heard through the grapevine that someone surfed this morning. It's a small town, people talk. I'd love to give credit to the humor-less scientist who helped me get back on the board, but then I'd have to admit to her that she might be kinda great. And you wouldn't want to do that. No, no, no. Because I wouldn't want it to get to her head. She's got enough going for her already. I have a surprise for you. You do? Come check this out. Wait, what? We have 102 confirmed community members coming to the vote tomorrow. Liam, are you serious? As a shark attack. Well, isn't that... "fintastic"? Was that a fish pun, Doc? Maybe. Liam, thank you for all of this. I couldn't have done any of this without you. I'd do it again in a heartbeat. Thank you for trusting me to be your spokesperson. I'd do it again in a heartbeat. Isla, there is something that I need to tell you. - Oh, sorry. - Go ahead. - I'll be quick. - Okay. Hello? How'd we do? You guys crushed it. Seriously, you're hired. I'm so happy we could help. You know, this has been really refreshing to see. You reminded me of your old self. What do you mean? The Liam before the awards and the accolades. The Liam who just loved the ocean. Look, I know coming back to Bay Cove wasn't what you wanted. That's the understatement of the year. But seeing you like this, with a mission, a purpose, working on something bigger than yourself, it's been really incredible. She's one special girl. Yeah, she is. Did you see the email? - No. - The grant hearing and the vote have been canceled. What? Why? I guess something came up and they decided to push it indefinitely. But the board, what does this mean for the board? The board has held off as long as they could on making a decision. Since you won't be presenting, I'm afraid they'll have to go in a different direction. By the way, I looked into the sale of the land near Pebble Beach. It looks like a packaging plant is going up there. I'm sorry, Isla. We did all we could. Hey, hey, is everything okay? It's canceled. The hearing tomorrow. What? Why? I don't know, Dr. Maris just said that the mayor pushed it indefinitely. Well, they can't just do that, can they? Apparently they can. Then, you know what? We'll find another way. Okay? There he is! Liam, that reef demonstration video you posted? Genius. You've got the environmentalists back on your good side. Could be a nice rebrand. "From bad boy to conservationist." Oh! It's you! You look great on camera. Ever thought about hosting? You posted a video of my work on social media without telling me? I didn't think that it'd be a big deal. What you were doing was so educational and if I thought... Genius! I couldn't have thought of a better PR move myself! Now, you know the mayor? She's gonna be the one leading the event. What event? The reveal of Liam's new WaterLight billboard right on Main Street. We're gonna start there for the press conference then we're gonna move up to their new site right on Pebble Beach. Sorry, Pebble Beach? Yes, honey, WaterLight has plans to buy that land. Build a plant. You knew that that land was important. I did not know that that was the site for the plant. But you knew about the plant? Liam, you told me you ended your WaterLight contract. You said you were done. Oh no, we re-upped for another three years. Liam, this lighting is perfect. Give me one minute, okay? Isla, please listen to me. You told me you weren't working with them anymore. So what, you lied to me? Not, exactly. I don't want to work with them anymore. But you still have a contract with them? I tried to end my contract but... They offered too much money. I didn't have a choice. So you used me? You used my cause to bolster your image? Make yourself the face of the Save the Reef Project and share it all over social media so what, you could clear your conscience about cashing your WaterLight check? I can't believe this. Isla, wait. Everyone was right about you, Liam. All you care about is yourself. Okay, this is perfect. Let's snap a couple of pics of you two, this lighting is fantastic. Now, if I get this printed, you'll sign it for me, right? Excuse me. Irving Conway is on his way. The CEO of WaterLight? Why? To make sure that everything goes as planned tomorrow. I mentioned to him that you wanted out and now he's threatening to sue. Good. Let him. For five million dollars. So it's in everyone's best interest that you just see this through. They need this to go well for the mayor to approve their request to build on the coast. Now get over there and give everyone that megawatt smile that you're known for. I can't believe I trusted him. You had no reason not to. Well, I can't believe I let this happen. You had no way of knowing that this was how things were gonna shake out. But if I'm being honest, this doesn't sound like Liam at all. He came by the studio after you, he asked me to help make something for the booth for the charity event. He lit up when he talked about you. About the reef. About what you two were doing together. Right. Trust me. I was there. He cares about you, Isla. Just not enough to tell me the truth. I should get back. I really need to finish my presentation. Okay. I'll come with you. Hey, if it wasn't for you, I would have missed the deadline to apply to Walleston. It's the least I can do. Come on, let's go. Okay, I'm almost done. What do you think? It doesn't matter what I think. It matters what you think. And what the board thinks. Nothing is going to make up for my lack of funding. But at least you'll have something to show the board. We're live at Town Hall with Mayor Wade and four time Pipeline winner, Liam Smith. Uh... Isla? Liam, do you have a few words for our loyal viewers? What's going on? We have an incredible opportunity here as a community to show support for a cause that can make a real difference. The Save the Reef Project. Now, the Save the Reef Project is spearheaded by the incomparable Dr. Isla Waters of the Marine Institute which aims to protect and preserve our precious reefs and the ecosystems that call it home. But the grant hearing today was cancelled. We have an opportunity here to demand change. To hold our leaders accountable to do what is best for our community. So I'm asking you to join me at Town Hall and show your support of the Save the Reef Project and demand that they hear our presentation as previously scheduled. I'm sorry, I thought we were here to discuss a new billboard for the WaterLight spot and the pending packaging plant in Bay Cove. Right. About that... This is no longer about me. I urge you to head down to Town Hall today and cast your votes, let your voices be heard. We want that land protected, not sold to WaterLight. And I know you feel the same way, Mrs. Mayor. Of course. Which is why the hearing today is so important. It's not up to me, Mr. Smith. You wouldn't want to let down your community after they came all this way to show their support, would you? No. Of course not. I know how hard Dr. Waters and this entire community has worked on this project and the municipal council would love to hear her speak this afternoon. Thank you. We're gonna continue live from Town Hall. This is a developing story. You heard it first from us. This is Christina Figueroa. Back to you. Um... I think we need to get you to Town Hall. - I think we do. - Come on! Yeah. Yeah, that's perfect. Okay. All right, I'll see you soon. Bye. Liam! What was that? Me, doing the right thing. Mr. Conway is not going to be happy... That's not my problem. I never signed the contract with WaterLight. I don't owe them anything. - You can't do this... - I'm done. With all of this, Connie. Thank you for everything. Excuse me? You're fired, Connie. Are all of these people here to vote for our cause? There you two are! Hi, what are you guys doing here? Well, Liam called us. Yeah, we came as soon as we heard. Already cast our vote. Didn't he call you? Um, I must have missed it. Couple of times. If you guys don't mind, I'll be right back. Thank you guys so much for voting. - I'll tell you later. - Okay, what's going on? I will fill you in. - Oh, there she is. - Hi! Mr. Gregson, what are you doing here? Not that I'm not honored that a member of the board showed up to support. I wouldn't have missed it! As soon as the board heard that the mayor was pushing this hearing, we had to support you and give you our votes. Thank you. But how did you know about that? I may have given them a sneak peek at your presentation. You did? It was incredibly compelling. It's a project we'd love to get behind. Thank you. That means so much. We'll see you inside, okay? Okay. Thank you! Hey. Hey. So, your billboard? Yeah, I called in some favors to get it replaced. It's amazing what offering an autographed photo will do. What about your contract? Well, I looked into it and since I technically never signed the contract with WaterLight, I don't owe them anything. I'm a free agent. You better get in there. You've got a grant to win. Did you hear? Could you hear what I was saying? - They loved it! - It felt really good. So, how'd it go? - I think I crushed it. - She totally crushed it. Dad, this is Liam Smith. - Good to meet you, son. - Good to meet you too. You know, I used to love to shred a big curl back in the day. - Yeah? - Dad! We should totally catch a wave sometime. Dude, that would be awesome! Never has he crushed a wave. - Dr. Waters? - Yes? I wanted you to hear it from me. I'm so sorry but the committee opted to go in a different direction. What? Your presentation was fantastic, your voter turnout was great. The committee just felt that it wasn't the right use of the community funds at this time. I'm so sorry, Dr. Waters. But... What happened? It's over. It's all over. Liam, I am so sorry. For what? That you gave it all up for nothing. Come on, it wasn't for nothing. This means I'm not getting the board seat. Right. I'll find a way to break the news to my parents. I'm sorry. It's okay. Come on. Let's get out of here. Okay. Hey, it's gonna be okay. I'm sorry. It's kinda cool that he did. Thank you. Hey, buddy! - Thank you. - Thank you. You know, you two could really do something with this. We could make it worthwhile, add a link to a donation page, get some more funding for the research. Since the grant is no longer an option. There's always next year, Isla. What I'm worried about is the Smiths and their dive shop and the reef. I mean, at the rate we're going, next year... might be too late. Then we might have to do something about that. Dad, Mayor Wade. Hi. Dr. Waters. Hi, Brooke. I have something I'd like to present to you. If you're open to it. Of course. The committee didn't feel they were in a position to release the funds. I disagreed. So I'd like to offer you grassroots funding as part of my campaign. The Save the Reef Project would be one of the tent poles of my campaign and I guarantee that my first order of business as Mayor would be to fully fund this project in partnership with the Marine Institute and oppose the sale of Pebble Beach to WaterLight. I reached out to the board before coming here and got their approval and they are 100% in favor. So, the decision is yours, Isla. I'll give you a moment to think about it. Can I get you something to drink? That would be great. Thanks. This way. - I have to go. - Where are you going? To find Liam. I'll be right back! Hey, um, is Liam here? We haven't seen him. Maybe check the dock? Okay, thank you. You have a really amazing son. Like, he might be one of the best people I've ever met. Oh, and I'm looking forward to our continued partnership. Did she really just say that? - She did. - Oh my God! That's fantastic! Are you kidding me? Don't worry. It's my mom's formula. Totally safe, I triple checked. Good, we wouldn't want you falling back into your old ways. No, I have no time for that. No, you don't. Because as a divemaster for the Marine Institute, you are going to be very busy. What? Mayor Wade wants to fund our project as part of her campaign. Liam, we did it, the Save the Reef Project is a go! The board is 100% behind us. - You got the board seat? - Yes! Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh! Yes! Wow. So now next time when you climb into my boat, it will be the right one. And I guess this technically means I'm your boss now. I think since we're contracted out we're more like partners. Partners implies that we'll be working together. Something I think we're rather good at. - Oh, do you now? - Do you not? I'll have to get back to you on that. Oh, so about the video. I will take it down. No, no! Don't! While I don't agree with the unethical practice of posting without somebody's permission, you were right. Giving people something to engage with is a great way to get them involved. And I was thinking that maybe we could turn the video into a series? As long as we leave the branding to Brooke. Fair enough. Look, Liam, I am so sorry for what I said last night. I was upset and I took it out on you and that is not okay... You had every right to. I mean, you weren't entirely wrong. I was being selfish and I cared way too much about my hair and I may have been a little bit cocky. But then I met this woman and she showed me that there's more to life than just focusing on myself. Plus she helped me get back on the board when nothing else could. Hm, well, she sounds pretty "fintastic." And like she might be your "sole" mate. Get it, sole, like the fish? Yes, you goof, I get it. Can I kiss you now? That would be absolutely "krilliant."
