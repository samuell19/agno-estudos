Why were we called in? Why were we called in? Hello. Put down the bottle, please. Friends, I just came from the minister's office. We had a very difficult conversation. Another agent was killed yesterday. That's our second agent killed. You know who did it? A gang called Snakehead. You send rookies to deal with those animals? They're ruthless. In any case, Snakehead is coming into the country to make a deal. You'll greet them and you know what to do. That ol' Snakehead won't be making any more deals. Is that clear? That's it. Are you ready? Okay. Last night I was watching a Bruce Lee movie. And? -I've wanted to be a nunchuks master since I was a kid. I wanted to be like Bruce Lee. You work hard all your life and you really want to make it, and suddenly the time comes and... wow! It all comes together in a second. Snakehead has entered the village. Copy that. Eli, move it, we're under fire! What happened? Their car is bulletproof. Hit the gas! Move it! The Onkelos Affair Dafna! Yo-Ya? Hey, what're you doing here? I didn't expect to see you here. Get in, I'll tell you on the way. Now? -Yeah. Let me tell my manager, okay? Okay. -Okay. -I'll be waiting. -Fine. Hey... What are you doing with that? Are you hiding something? -Not from you. Find something interesting? Nothing is as interesting as you, I have one goal in life and I'll do anything to reach it. That sounds good. I know you do a lot for us. That's why I love you so much. Kfar Sava Rabbinate and Religious Council Welcome. -Greetings. Congratulations. -Thanks. -Thanks. -Amen. I wish you all the best. -Amen. -Very nice. This is the best part of my job, seeing the happy couples. Congratulations. -Thanks. We'll open a marriage file for you, you'll be using it throughout the process, God willing. After the wedding you'll get your marriage certificate which you'll take to the Ministry of the Interior and register as a married couple. Congratulations. -Thanks. -ID, please. Here. Just a minute. Yonatan... Yonatan Bar. Something wrong? Be patient, he's checking. Maybe you were married before. I was, to you, in a previous life. Yonatan, your father's name doesn't appear on your ID. It doesn't say who your father was. The truth is, I never met him. My father... I grew up in institutions. You know, orphanages, foster homes, but I served in the army, I was born in Israel, I was even in an elite unit. -That's right. Didn't you ask your mother? My mother died when I was a baby. What do his parents matter? We're the ones getting married. Congratulations. -Thanks. -I... Yonatan, I offer... my condolences. I realize yours is a tragic story. I want you to understand. In order to marry you by Jewish law we need to know who your parents are and who your parents are. That way we can work everything out. Dafna, we know who your parents are. That's fine. Yonatan, we need one thing in order to complete the process, your father's identity. Why is that so important? Let me explain. Imagine, for instance... that you accidentally married your sister. Does she look like my sister? -Seriously. Look, in the Tractate of Marriage the Talmud describes a similar case. The Talmud says, if we know who a person's mother is but not his father, the sages call him "the Silent One." Look, I hope you realize this is no game. We want to marry you, but we have to know who your father is. Otherwise I can't help you. What's gonna be? -It'll be fine. Yo-Ya, don't you see? They aren't going to let us get married. Let's forget the rabbinate. You know what? Let's get married abroad. I'm not going to be a Silent One or a bastard. I'm going to find out who my father is. Find out who your father is? You never cared before. For 30 years you didn't even try to find out. Why now? -You're right. -So? I never really cared who my father is, but now I see how important it is and I'll do whatever it takes to find him. So you're a Silent One, huh? Who'd have believed it? I know what that means. It means that until you find your roots we can't get married. What now, Yo-Ya? -I have a few ideas. Phone your commander. He likes you, he'll help you. Hey, Mike, what's up? -How are you? -I'm okay. Want a drink? -No, let's sit here and talk. Yo-Ya, why are you so interested in your father all of a sudden? The rabbi at the rabbinate said I can't get married until I find my father. Listen, you asked me to help you. I prepared a dossier. When you enlisted we investigated you. This is the dossier. It's all here. Here's what we found out. The Onkelos Affair. "His lifetime companion Tzippora was murdered by unidentified assailants. "Murder motive: unknown. "The police were unable to crack the case." What does that have to do with me? Onkelos is your father. Onkelos? Your father lived in northern Israel, and after the incident, in which he was apparently wounded, he moved to a Druze village. Apparently he's still there. I'll give you the information, you'll go to a man named Yussuf, and he'll take you to your father. We spoke a few days ago. Hello. -Hello. Who's Yussuf? -I'm Yussuf. I understand Mike spoke to you about my father. That's right. -I'm Onkelos' son, Yo-Ya. Yo-Ya? What do you want? You guys, I'm not here to argue. I just want to see my father. I understand Mike spoke to you. Where's my father? Hold on, hold on. -This could be a trap. Calm down. -Don't forget our father's warning. Don't worry, I spoke to the man. It'll be all right, Allah willing. You wait here and don't let anybody in. Come with me. This is where your father lives. Welcome. Onkelos? -I knew you'd come. Your facial features... are like your mother's. -My mother's? It's been thirty years. And it's as if... it was just a week ago. Tell me what happened. Why did they kill her? I'll tell you. We beat the British and we beat the Turks, and then came the mob who set their eye on my property and that of my forefathers. They wanted to steal it from me but I didn't give in. One day they came to kill me and my family. Your mother tried to protect me. Luckily, you were in the other room and when I opened my eyes I saw... I'd lost the apple of my eye, your mother. Hello! What an honor! Welcome. It's been a long time. Welcome. Thank you, Nazima. My pleasure. It's an honor. You know why I came? I wanted to get married. I went to the rabbinate. They refused to marry me. They called me... a Silent One. A Silent One? You, a Silent One? -That's what they say. You know what a Silent One is? -No. You're the son of Onkelos, son of Mattathias. You aren't a Silent One, you're a Pure Jewish. So was your mother Tzippora. But you never married, did you? No, we never married. We were together for a long time. Your mother got pregnant and we never got around to marrying. Well, whatever happened, I'm taking you back with me. You're coming with me. Absolutely not. As long as that mob is around I'm not going near there. -Who are those people? Why are you afraid of them? Take good care of this and God will take care of you. Hello, Mr. Brenner. Hello. You were looking for me? -Yes. Have a seat. Something to drink? -No, thanks. -Yes? My dear Mr. Brenner, your name is on the documents of the organization I'm investigating. Do you still work with those humanitarian organizations? Why are you here? I need your help to get to everyone involved in the affair. I'm not saying a word. First show me the documents. Here. -Let me take a look at this. The Onkelos Affair. Does anyone know about this? -Nobody. Can I trust you? One condition: I work on this alone. Okay, I have a similar condition. What? -Nothing goes through the usual channels. Everything goes through me and me alone. Okay, I'll take the case. You can go now. C'mon, let me show you. How's it going? -Hey. How's that? -Nice. You've still got it. C'mere, you guys. -How's it going? Okay, and you? -Great. Listen... -What's up, Yo-Ya? You said you're getting married. No, I'm having trouble. The wedding isn't my first concern. I just showed Mike this dossier and told him I want to find whoever killed my mother. That's what friends are for. Listen, these guys aren't beginners. You want to look for hardened criminals? I don't think you have enough info on them. This is no game, and besides, they approached their damned objective like mercenaries. Why? What did they do? Use your head. Okay, Eli, listen, if you don't want to get involved, fine. I'll go it alone. Shame on you! Are you crazy? I'd go through hell and high water for you. Don't be so insecure. -You want a kick in the face? You want some hot sauce to cool you off? -Cut it out. Listen up, there were several people involved but the dossier only covers Spiegel. Who's Spiegel? -Spiegel? This is Spiegel. This is Spiegel? -And he's our first stop. Basically, an asshole. -Michel, are you in? -I'm in. You're in? Why? I have my reasons. What do you care? Okay, me and Eli will go for this Spiegel guy, and you, Michel, get some info on the others, okay? -Got it. Listen, keeping... all the... It's not easy, we're talking 120 employees, that doesn't happen overnight. I built my whole career on this. Sure, sure, no problem. You can count on me. Eli, that creep Spiegel just left his factory. Here you go. -Thanks. Yes. Are you from around here? Yeah. We're looking into a certain affair. The Onkelos Affair. Ever heard of it? No, never heard of it. Maybe you know someone who has? No, this is the first time I've heard it mentioned. Are you new here? A year or two... Okay. Just a sec. Don't answer. Hold on. -I've had it! I've had it with all your phone calls! What's gonna be? Go ahead and talk. How long will I have to put up with this? Hello? -I hope I'm not disturbing you. Who is this? -Arik, from the wedding hall. Listen, two guys were here, they spoke to some people. They asked about the Onkelos Affair. The Onkelos Affair? -Yeah, they said they're from a kibbutz near here. I'm not so sure, they look... like phonies. There's something fishy about them. Don't worry, I'll send someone to check out who they are and what they want. It'll be all right. -Okay. What's up? -How's it going? Is your gear working? My gear is always ready, locked and loaded. Good. You're gonna be busy. Let's go. Listen, there's someone around here asking about the Onkelos Affair. I sent one of my men to tail him. This guy says he's from around here. I don't think so. Give me the okay and I'll get my men to look into this. The Onkelos Affair gave us a lot of trouble. True. -But our past activities weren't exactly welcomed. Remember? Well, before this blows up in our faces the next step should be to find out who's behind this guy. We need to know what he wants. Agreed. I suggest that Zeevik deal with him. Don't forget, we were all warriors once, too, but Zeevik, you're a warrior, too, we trust you. We're all warriors, but we're businessmen now. What we do is confidential and illegal, and another thing we need to focus on is the media, gentlemen. We can't let the media find out. So far, everything I've done was absolutely confidential. Nobody knew or heard about it. There she is. Wake up. The whole night... Yeah. That Spiegel knows how to have fun. All night long. -Let's go in. What are you doing here? Who are you? -Does the Onkelos Affair ring a bell? Remember? You don't know who you're messing with. Sit down. -Sit down? -I said sit down, so sit down! Listen here, Mr. Spiegel, you killed my mother and wounded my father. I'm Onkelos' son! What do you want from me? You carried out a murder for crooks. You shot Onkelos and then shot his wife, you scum! You know what? Fuck off and get the hell out of my house! We'll deal with you, don't worry. Onkelos the Sage, I remember the days when my late father would tell us: Watch over Onkelos. Protecting you is etched in our minds. We say: The hidden things are for the Lord our God and the revealed things are for us. We say: You can't escape your destiny. Everything is from Allah. Yussuf, I've lived here for many years and you're like family to me and I want to thank you for that. It's our duty and honor to host a wise man like you. May Allah have mercy on your father, Abu Yussuf. He was like a brother to me. Knock on wood. -Thank you, Nazima. I loved him so. Here you go. -Thank you. We fought several wars together. May Allah have mercy on him. Allah wanted him near Him. -Thank you, Nazima. You're welcome. What can I tell you? You already know, you've been among us Druze for years. You aren't a guest, you're family. Thank you, Yussuf. -And we'll carry on our father's way. Thank you. Zeevik? Ready to go? Zeevik? What's up? "Spiegel," a leading businessman, was found dead in his apartment Shit! -What's the matter? Something came up at work. You'll have to go alone today. What happened? -Trouble. But we made a date. Zeevik, you're coming with me. You're going alone today. Okay, see you later. Hello? I'm telling you, this is the guy who's out to get us. What is this, a mystery? Who are these people? I'm sure this whole affair... Listen, maybe we took this Onkelos business in the past. -We went too far. Onkelos, Onkelos... we have to stop talking about it? Stop talking about it? You want to go talk to them? Then what do you suggest? We need to stop them. No question. From what I've found out, these are pros who know what they're doing. Brenner, I've been waiting for you for an hour. There was traffic. -You promised it'd be all right. I know. -What's happening? Take this card. The go-between's details are here. He has the whole dossier. There's something else you need to deal with. Someone squealed on my men. Squealed? Don't worry. We'll be in touch. How's it going? All good? What's up? -You know the last time I worked out? You need it. You're getting married. Listen up, you guys. Okay? According to this file, Shmuel Zissman was involved in the murder of Yo-Ya's mother. This is Shmuel Zissman. See him? This is Shmuel Zissman. Him? -Yes, him. -This creep? -Yes, this creep. Where'd you get that? -From the go-between, remember? Go on. -It's like this, the plan is... Get over here, honey. Have a seat. I'll get us some champagne and I'll be right back, okay? Shmuel Zissman! Yes. -Yes? Who are you? -We've been following you. You've been following me? Who are you, anyway? Listen here, we want a word with you. About what? I said we want a word with you. What could it be about? Don't ask questions, okay? Come with us. Get in there! What do you want? Who are you? Shmuel Zissman! You killed innocent people! You killed my mother. The Onkelos Affair, remember? Yes, yes. You think you'll get something out of me? Go ask Spiegel. He'll tell you everything. Go to him! -You want to join Spiegel? You won't get anything out of me. -Cut the crap! It was you! Admit it! Don't make me laugh. Yo-Ya, go see who's at the door. Make sure the coast is clear. Speak up! Was it you? Speak up! Was it? Was it? What a beautiful tune. If life were always like this we'd all be happy. Keep going. I see your son doesn't know the whole story. He's on the wrong track. -Why, what's the matter? Tell me, what does your name mean, Onkelos? Onkelos... Many years ago there was a Roman nobleman named Onkelos. Onkelos translated the Torah into the common language, Aramaic. Their common language. Yussuf, I know the history very well. I fled from the mob who set their eye on my property and that of my forefathers and came to live with you. Hey. -How's it going? Did you get my message? That's the second man they've bumped off. We need to get a handle on this. Ask all your contacts how they managed to get to them. We have to stop this. We can't let them get another one of us, we can't let them catch us unprepared again. See you later. Keep your eyes peeled. Hold on... I'll call you back. Bye. What's up? Everything okay? I'm here at the country club. Yeah. His name is Zeevik. A very gifted former soldier. He won a medal for bravery. He's out of the service now, but he acts as if he still is. And you're telling me you don't know why he's tailing my man, huh? Don't worry. He won't be tailing him any more. Well, I'm very worried. I know they're out to get him. Don't give me orders, okay? Well? Looks like we were followed. Whoever he is, he's a pro. What? Couldn't you kick his ass? The guy's a pro. A tough nut to crack, but I gave him something to think about. I'm sure he's in some hospital now getting treated. Hey, what's up? Trouble? We know there were three people involved in the Onkelos Affair. -Okay. I'm sure Cheeser is next. It's your job to protect Cheeser. Take good care of him. Why me? He's trouble. That's how it goes. I'm counting on you. These guys are trouble. No problem. -Bye. Who are you? -I give the orders around here. You can call me Brenner. Brenner. I know everything about your shady nightclub. I suggest you talk to your man and put a leash on him. Why? Your man is over-eager. Okay, okay. Okay, Dafna, but I can't talk now. We'll talk later. Why are you screening my calls? You don't answer at night, you don't answer in the morning. What's going on? -I can't talk now. We'll talk later, okay? -Again? You can't talk now, you can't ever talk... What's going on, Yo-Ya? Is it another girl? Is that what you think? Yes, that's what I think. You're never home, you don't take my calls, we wanted to get married. Whatever. Bye. You know where to find me. Bye! What's up, Mike? -How are you? I have a book here that'll help you a lot in the future. Great. Thanks. This book will help you achieve a lot of your goals. Here are photos and info on the third man involved in the affair. I want you to finish this as soon as you can because people in high places are snooping around and I don't want them to discover us or you. I want you working for me again. Is this about Cheeser? -That's right. How'd you get hold of it? We have money, friends, connections that helped us get to him. Look, Zeevik is a good guy. He's trying to prevent the next hit job. Don't forget who sent Zeevik to find out who's doing these jobs. We sent him. We don't owe him anything. What looked good then doesn't look good any more. If he opens his mouth, we're goners. We're businessmen, we can't afford to leave a trail. You're right. Yes, hello. -Have a seat. What's up? -Listen, Zeevik, we decided to take you off this case once and for all. -I don't get it. I just put bodyguards on all our men, and extra tight security on Cheeser. He's next in line. That's enough! I don't think you get it. We want you to drop it completely. -It's all over. Drop it? They just knocked off both Shmuel and Spiegel. They're dangerous. They must be stopped. Zeevik, according to the police there's no evidence of murder. -No evidence? Here's a file full of evidence. What's going on here? Give me that file. We need to hush this up. Drop it! This man isn't going to drop it, that's what you don't understand. He isn't going to just sit there. Zeevik, people in high places are asking questions and in the end you and we will take the blame. High places? Questions? About me? I don't get it. -Zeevik, listen carefully. These are our orders, drop the matter and do as you're told! I get it. You're a bunch of creeps. I'm not letting this drop. We have nothing left to say. Hey. -What's up? Listen... you see these men? I want you to show these photos to all your people. I want updates, day or night. As much info as possible. Got it. Don't worry, Zeevik, I'll get these to all my people. I'll call you as soon as I hear anything. -Excellent. Very good. Are you sure he's in there? Maybe we should get out and see. That's him, don't you see? Hey, can I offer you a light? What do you think you're doing? He used to be... -You know who I am? He used to guard crooked politicians. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, it's a fight. We have to take that into account, he's under tight security. Forget it, let's get out of here. Hello, Onkelos the Sage. -Greetings. Yussuf sent you some peanuts. -Thank you. He sent me apples yesterday. Onkelos the Sage, what is this stick? I made that stick to commemorate the Exodus from Egypt. Yes, I see, the ten plagues, blood, frogs... Onkelos the Sage, Yussuf and I were just talking about your son and I understand he took the news about his mother very hard. That's right. My story is a long one. My family goes back a long way, we lived here in the North and I had a lot of property. Land, houses, until one day people came, businessmen with connections in the government, who said they wanted my land for government purposes. And they took it, but I know it was a lie! And they divided my property among themselves! Onkelos the Sage, I know your story. Despite everything you went through you decided to give up everything and come live in our village. No, I didn't give up. Your father, whom I love and admire very much, offered me a place here in the village until trouble passed. And I'm sure... one day the truth will come to light. I hope it will all end and you and your son will live together again. Allah willing. -Allah willing. Call me the minute he gets here. -Got it. Hello, Cheeser. How are you? -Fine. I have a problem here. Ahmed, see what this gentleman's problem is. Cheeser. -Yes, who are you? Cheeser! Got you now, motherfucker! Where are you going, asshole?! Now for the news. An affair from the past was uncovered involving former senior officials suspected of forging documents and taking over land through organizations and foundations supported by foreign countries and organizations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that other countries getting involved in Israeli affairs is a severe affront. At the government meeting, PM Netanyahu responded to criticism of the process of deporting infiltrators. The state has the right to deport illegal immigrants... What's going on here? -Take your hand off your gun and put it down slowly. Slowly. Kick it over here. Sit down. Slowly. Sit down. The guy who was following you, Michel, where is he? Michel? There isn't much left of him. Did you kill him? -No, it was an accident, but if he'd fallen into my hands it would've ended differently. You know he's a friend of ours? A friend of yours? What about my friends? Cheeser, Shmuel, Spiegel, aren't they human beings? Watch out or you'll join them. We're asking you to drop the matter. When we walk out, you stop following us. Drop it. Your hear me?! Listen here, I'm not dropping anything. You don't know who you're messing with. You don't know what I'm capable of. Our business isn't with you. We're on the same side. -What side? Let's go. If you don't want to join our magic list, get off our tails. -I heard you. You have to come here, to where I work? I tried phoning a thousand times. You screen my calls. You very well know why, okay? I've had it with your games. Really. It doesn't work this way. You're right. I was wrong. Listen, I'm back for good. For good? I promise. For good. So that's it? No more travels? Anything to tell me? Some things are best not mentioned. Yes, you're right. Let's forget the past, leave it behind us, and focus on our plans. Well? -Very good. We finally caught him. They won't get away now. Here's what I want you to do. Tomorrow we meet at the village... Okay. -We ambush him and capture him. Hi. Today we capture him. Tear him apart! Finito! Anything comes up, call me. You have your gear, right? Let's not blow it this time. Does your dad know I'm coming? No, actually. We'll surprise him. Yeah? -Last time I saw him I told him I want to get married. I'm sure he'll be glad to meet you. I'll be glad to meet him, too. Whoa! My God! He's coming this way! -Out of the car! Out of the car. Out of the car. -Who are you? Out of the car. -This is a mistake. Who are you? Not a word out of you! Y'hear? Who are you? Going to visit your dad, huh? Zeevik, I've got Yo-Ya. Get over here. Did you kill Cheeser? Did you kill Spiegel? What are you talking about? You goddamn motherfucker. -Never heard of them. Get over to the car! You don't know who you're messing with. -Get over to the car. Move it! Move it! Excellent work. Bravo. Did you think I'd give up so easily? What's going on here? -Butt out. I'm taking him in for questioning. What? Where are you taking him? -You take her home. You're coming with me. -Let's go, let's go... Move it! Inside! -What's going on? Inside! Sit down! Sit down! Don't give up, do you? Tell me who you're working for, y'hear? I already told you. You and I are working toward the same goal. That's what you think. You're crazy! You and your buddies are killing innocent men. Now tell me what this was all about! "Was"? I don't think it's over yet. What do you want? -Start talking! Let me go and I'll tell you everything, before someone else gets killed. Halt! Halt or I'll shoot! Drop the gun. Put 'em on. What's going on here? Who are you? What do you want? -Zeevik... Patriot, huh? Sit down or I'll kill you. Sit! What a couple of idiots. Fighting each other without realizing you're being used. Used? Who's using us? Our donors overseas, they don't like all the secret organizations you're protecting, especially when they get in the way of their personal interests. Interests? What do you mean? You were told to drop the matter but you refused. What are you talking about? A sophisticated plot by fiendish organizations. -Fiendish? Not fiendish. It's a humanitarian organization that knows what's good for the country. Knows what's good for country? You call that humanitarian? They killed my friends. And they know what's good for me? Do you know how much this land is worth? Do you? -Yes, I know. The lives of our friends who were killed for no reason. I'll kill you, too. Men? Yeah, he's here with me. Get over to the warehouse. "A song of ascensions. "From the depths I called upon You, "Lord, hear my voice. "May Your ears be attentive to all my plaints. "If God begrudges iniquities, "Lord, who will stand? "For with You is forgiveness so that You will be feared. "My soul yearned for the Lord "and longed for His word. "My soul yearns for God more than the guards of morning "yearn for morning." I'm shocked. Who are these people you were dealing with? You mean Zeevik? he also fell in the trap I know. Mike told me everything. And after all this misery Michel was the one who paid the price. Yes, it's tragic for all of us. At least we accomplished our mission. Well, friends, that's all behind us. I'm going on a short vacation. I understand you're going to see your father. I knew you'd be back with good news. I've been waiting. -Father, I was waiting for this day, too. I gather this is your bride-to-be. This is Dafna. You know, I've known Yonatan for many years. I always asked about his parents. He wouldn't tell me a thing. But since we went to the rabbinate and they asked about his parents he hasn't stopped talking about you. That is the faith that kept me strong and gave me hope that one day the truth would come to light. "Bless the Lord for sustaining us and bringing us to this day." -Amen. This is the necklace of Elijah the Prophet, with 130 beads. I made it. It will protect you, amen. -Amen. "It shall be heard in the cities of Judea and the streets of Jerusalem, "the sound of joy and happiness, "the voice of groom and bride." "The laughter of grooms from their wedding canopies "and young men from their musical feasts." This... was made by Tzippora, Yonatan's mother. "He who blessed our holy forefathers "Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, "Moses, Aaron, David and Solomon, "and our mothers Sara, Rebecca, Rachel and Leah and Miriam the Prophetess "and Abigail and Queen Esther, daughter of Avihail, "may He bless you with all the blessings in the Torah. "May God bless you and keep you, "May God shine His countenance on you and teach you. "May God lift His countenance to you and grant you peace. "And they will place My name on the Israelites and I will bless them."
