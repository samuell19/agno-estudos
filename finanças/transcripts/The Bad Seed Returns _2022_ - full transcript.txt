[doctor] you know, It costs the same whether you talk or not. I'm aware. What is running through that brain of yours? What if the laws of physics applied to people as well? Action. Equal and opposite reaction? I don't think That's what newton meant. My aunt wants to send me to a boarding school. I'm aware. And just for the record, I've heard that school is outstanding. Its alumni end up at-- Ivy leagues all across the country. I'm aware. I've read the brochure. Twice. Most girls in your shoes would be thrilled. Robert wants me out of the house. And why would he want that? Did you behave in such a way That might have precipitated his decision? Did your action cause a reaction? Maybe. So you created a problem. And what is the proper response to a problem of our own making? Solving it. And you are good at solving problems, Aren't you? Yes. I'm very good at solving problems. Thank you, dr. March. This has been incredibly helpful. I am so glad to have been able to help you, emma. All right. Bye. [♪♪] Robert... I wanted to apologize... Uncle robert... I just wanted to apologize... Hi. Hey. I thought you might be thirsty. Can we talk? Uncle robert... I just wanted to apologize For forgetting to give you back your knife. I found it next to all the pool equipment And it just slipped my mind to give it back to you, so... I'm sorry. Thank you. You know, Change is hard for everyone. [emma] mm-hmm. For me... After my dad, you know, It's just... I guess, sometimes, something gets in my head... And... Maybe I'll do something I shouldn't have. I understand. Maybe this is good for us, huh? Maybe we could start over. Yeah. And who knows, Maybe st. Crispin's will be good for me. Really? Yeah. 90% of their grads go ivy. I want to go ivy, So I'd say those are pretty good odds. Yeah. Besides, you're doing what's best for your family And for me, so. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey... Come here. [angela] emma, do you want a ride to the party? No, steph's is right around the corner. I'm going to walk. Okay. Well, have fun! And just let me know if you need anything. Anything at all. -I will. -And... Robert told me you two are good.
