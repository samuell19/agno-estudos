(copters whirring) - One gunship (mumbles) village, suppressing tight fire, over. - [Robin] Crossed off rebound, it's Robin Hood. - [Gunship Pilot] Oh it's going towards the ground Robin Hood, we're right beside you. - [Pilot] He's out here right front, to your left. - [Robin] Flank right. (gunfire) (mumbles) and the suppression. - [Robin] Roger that. - [Gunship Pilot] Robin Hood Six this is Robin Hood Three, mission completed, we're returning to home base this time. - [Robin] Roger. - [Gunship Pilot] Okay, make a bend, turn right there. - [Researcher] Who's next? - [Bob] Randy Sorenson. - [Researcher] What's his background? - [Bob] Age 27, Staff Sergeant, two years Vietnam. Platoon overrun up by DMZ. He called for air support. Somehow things got confused and choppers starting firing on his position. Cut the platoon to ribbons. You know he had to shoot it down to stop the attack? - [Researcher] No wonder he lost it. - [Bob] Well he didn't, not right away. He stayed on the line for about six more months, six months. - [Nurse] Could you identify yourself please? - Sorenson. - [Bob] Then one morning they found him in his hut. Schizophrenic catatonia. - [Researcher] What's been the treatment? - Electroshock. We cranked through enough voltage to sear away half his memory. Once he stopped remembering, he came out of it. - Any side effects? - Nothing serious. Slight problem with fantasies and a violent reaction to alcohol, understandable under the circumstances. - And the prognosis? - Oh he should be fine. He has to stay on medication, but he should be fine. Should be fine. Randy Sorenson, 517-43-160, final discharge interview. Send him in please. - Hi Bob. - Randy, hello, come in. Good to see ya, how you been? - Fine, Bob. - Sit down please. Well you ready to go? - I'm ready, I'm ready. - Good good, listen, just a couple of things I wanted to talk over with you, Randy, before you left. - Go. - First these. - Pills? - Yes, I'd like you to take one a week. If you feel a depressant stage coming on or impending, why go ahead and take one at your own discretion. - For how long? - Well forever, Randy. - Well I've done everything you wanted since I've been here, I mean you wanted to fry my brain and I let you. I took your pills in the morning and your needles at night. And I never complained, Bob. But that's over. I'm gonna find another way. - [Bob] I don't think there is another way, Randy. - Uh-huh. - Well where you gonna go? - Corencia. - Corencia? Sounds nice. I'd like to go there myself. Listen Randy, give me a call anytime even if it's to say hello-- - Sure Bob. - I'd appreciate it. - Don't let this place get you down. - No I won't. Take care of yourself. Randy! Don't forget your pills. (door closes) - You seem concerned. - I don't like the way we do things. - You have any doubts about releasing him? - I guess there's nothing more we can do for him, but I don't know, it just seems we cut him off. Slap a bandaid on him and send him out the door, no outpatient therapy, no followup. - Sooner or later, that's what it always comes down to. - I get the feeling we're just fusing bombs, sending them off to explode. - Who's next? (marching drum music) (pills clinking) (gentle acoustic guitar music) ♫ I don't know where I'm going ♫ I don't know where I've been ♫ But the hour's quickly coming ♫ When I say goodbye to another road and another friend ♫ I'm gonna be leaving again ♫ 'Cause there's love in this country ♫ Oh there's love in this land ♫ It's where the sun puts out the evening ♫ And the snow cleans off the land ♫ There's love in this country ♫ Oh there's love in this land ♫ So take your hand from off my shoulder ♫ 'Cause I'm strong enough to stand ♫ There's a mood in the air and it's coming on ♫ Faster than a pushing plow, ooh I got to move now ♫ Get it on, get it up, get it out of my way ♫ I can't stay ♫ I'm gonna look until I find it ♫ It's in a town or a face or just along the highway ♫ I'm gonna look until I find it ♫ 'Cause I know there's a chance that it's coming my way ♫ I just can't stay, oh Lord I just can't stay ♫ You know this feeling so strong ♫ I can't push it away ♫ 'Cause there's love in this country ♫ Oh there's love in this land ♫ It's where the sun turns on the morning ♫ And the snow cleans off the land ♫ But there's love in this country ♫ There's love in this land ♫ So take your hand from off my shoulder ♫ You see I'm strong enough, strong enough to stand ♫ Shall I pack your bags for you ♫ Should we leave on a midnight train ♫ Bound for nowhere special ♫ But we're bound for nothing better if we choose to stay ♫ I can't stay ♫ I'm gonna look until I find it ♫ It's in a town or a face or just along the highway ♫ I'm gonna look until I find it ♫ 'Cause I know there's a chance that it's coming my way ♫ I just can't stay, oh Lord I just can't stay ♫ You know this feeling so strong ♫ I can't push it away ♫ Oh there's love in this country ♫ Oh there's love in this land ♫ It's where the sun puts out the evening ♫ And the snow cleans off the land ♫ But there's love in this country ♫ My God there's love in this land ♫ So take your hand from off my shoulder ♫ See I'm strong enough, strong enough to stand (door creaks open and closes) (loud shuffling) - Wow. (gentle synthesizer music) (loud snap) (gentle acoustic guitar music) (harmonica accompaniment) - Hey Randy, I didn't know you were back. I saw the smoke, I thought I'd come by and see who was using your place. Hey, you'll be burning that coffee now if you're not careful. - Oh come on in, Charlie. It'll be ready in a minute. - All right. Well you can't have been back long. I'd have seen some sign. - Just a few weeks. - I... I heard you were in the army. You through with that now? - [Randy] Yeah, yeah, awhile back. - Come back to pick up your dad's trap line huh? - Yeah. - It's tougher now. Ecology, Randy. Everybody's talking about ecology. That means a fella can't make a living in the woods anymore, by God that sure is right. - I hope this isn't too bad. Stuff on the shelf's a little old. - They used to make this out of sweet leaves and navassa roots. - Hope it isn't too bitter. - Chippewa coffee's gotta taste better than that. (laughter) Want any? - Oh no. - I haven't been in this cabin for... Well I guess the last time I was here was the night they found you and your dad. He was a fine man, your father. I never knew a better trapper. I never knew a man could handle a pelt like him. He sure had a way with things. You know, John and me, we used to run together. We were both a little wild in those days. (chuckles) Then he met her. It's a pity you never knew your mother, Randy. She was a remarkable woman. When John would be off in the woods, she would spend her afternoons down by the river with her books. He'd meet her on the way back. They'd walk back here to the cabin together. She was... Quiet. And the most beautiful girl, inside and outside, anyone around here ever saw. Just being in the same room with her was nice. You know what I mean? - I think I do, Charlie. I think I knew her from the books she read. And the things my father used to say about her. - Well I was here the night you were born. The night she died. I always felt he... He sorta died that night too. If it hadn't been for you, I think he'd have taken a gun to himself. Well soon after he died. I was the one that found you. - Yeah, I remember that, Charlie. - We didn't think you were gonna make it either. Your face was all black from the frost. You must've drug his body five or six miles to get him back to the cabin here. Why didn't you just go for help, Randy? - I don't know, Charlie. I guess it never occurred to me. - Yeah, well... Well I... I know you're not gonna get much for those. Well it's good to have you back, Randy. You let me know if you... (bell rings) (door closes) - When did you get back? - I got some pelts. - Pelts. I haven't been buying any for a few years now. I don't even know what they're worth anymore. If you like, leave them and I can check. I'll tell you now Randy that they ain't worth much. I'll tell you what. You take what you need and I'll put it against what these pelts go for. - [Young Randy] Dad! Dad! Dad! (wolves growling) Dad, Dad! Dad! (ominous atmosphere music) Dad, dad! Dad! (laughter) - [Bar Patron] Seems like a lot of trouble to go through just to test the machine. - What trouble, there's three feet of flat ice out there (mumbles). Just got it out there and hoped for the best. That thing went so fast I almost couldn't stay with it. - What'll it be? - What's the entry fee for the race? - Nine bucks. - [Terrance] Hey fellas, look what just walked in the door! - Fill this out. - [Terrance] My God, it looks starved. - You don't show up at the starting line, you lose the entry fee, there's no refunds. - [Terrance] Poor hobo, we gotta pick up a collection for him. And look at that snowmobile. Where you been, in jail? - What are you, trying to be funny or something? - No I don't try to be anything. You kinda look like you lost a lot, you know what I mean? What's the matter, maybe you're a little jealous now that I won a few races since you were gone right? (laughs) No offense meant of course. It's gonna be just like it was, is it? We can arrange that fine. (crowd chatter) - Get the race money. - Here you go. We got 20, 30, and 60. - Thank you. - Look here everybody! It's Randy Sorenson! Just about enough to set up the bar, Randy! Wouldn't you like to drink with all your friends? (laughs) Look at him! Look, he wants to drink with all his friends! - Well it's nice to see you haven't changed, Terrance. - Changed? No use tampering with perfection, right Merle? (laughter) Sorenson. It's gonna be a real pleasure seeing you out on the track. (chuckles) - You better give him the drink. - Thanks a lot for contributing to the racing pool! (laughs) (dramatic piano music) - [Official] Start with the lights. And you'll notice the lights are green, flag hanging on top of the lights! I will hold you at the line with a red flag! Do not watch me, watch the lights! - [Announcer] Here we are, ladies and gentlemen, another big one. This is one of the biggest in the country and you are gonna see (mumbles). (electric guitar rock music) (crosstalk announcing) There they go on the inside, both riders running chicken on the cap. Oh he lost it, he lost it! That driver all right, that driver all right? Red flag out, red flag out, look out, watch it. Hold it, hold it in there high. Number two, look at that run, go behind. Look out, look out! He's picking up over there. - Okay? - (mumbles) it's your race. - We'll see about that. - [Announcer] Riders getting to the start line. Getting on his glasses, they're ready to go. Drag them up, men! Get them out and move them out, watch that long green. Watch that long green. Keep an eye on him, out of the way, here we go! Here they come! T. Law, there's Randy Sorenson right behind him. T. Law driving wild, looks back for Randy. They're on the east end of the track now, the front seater, here comes some more machines, could be trouble, could be trouble, hoo boy, look at that! Randy Sorenson, Randy Sorenson has now taken over the lead, but he's getting pushed hard by T. Law who's got it down and done, shoot these boys are neck and neck. The crowd just standing on their heels watching every move, there goes Randy, Randy Sorenson just followed T. Law on the east end of the track. T. Law trying to get him to go to the right. Randy's still go the lead, I don't know (mumbles) action and the pack is tight, the pack is tight, anything could happen. (mumbles) back here, T. Law has taken over the lead, Randy went on the inside, T. Law went high, here they come. Round and around the bend, (mumbles) pushing hard. There is Randy making his move, he's making his move, it's tight, it's tight, Randy looking back he's got it, and he lost his ski ladies and gentlemen, he lost his ski! He's got it, he's hanging on, how in the world is that man hanging on? T. Law and Randy Sorenson side by side! What a race, one ski, one ski (mumbles). Randy Sorenson looking to hold them back and Sorenson, Sorenson drives back, T. Law takes it and here comes Sorenson! Oh beautiful move! Law looks back to the left, Sorenson inching behind him on the side, and Sorenson in the lead. He's going high, look out, look out, here comes Law, here comes Law, he's got it! He's got it! They're coming down the final turn now, who's gonna get it? Who's got it, there's that checkered flag, who's the winner? T. Law is the winner! (upbeat funk music) (gasps) - Thanks Christ. (tense ringing) Oh no! Help me. Huh? Randy! What's the matter? The wolves. The wolves! Oh God man, not again! (dramatic piano music) ♫ I'm gonna look until I find it ♫ It's in a town or a face just along the highway ♫ I'm gonna look until I find it (loud drilling) - [Billy] Leave it! I can't look at nothing 'till Thursday! Maybe not even then. Oh, Speed! What are you in here for, a ski? - You still interested in my cabin, Billy? - Hell yeah, what do you want for it? - [Randy] I need a truck. I need a sled and I need some gear. - Yeah, you wanna trade? - Sure. - What do you want for it again? - I need a truck, a hot sled and some gear. - [Billy] We can work that out. (dramatic synthesizer music) - [John] They made all of the drivers leave their machines in an open compound out in the middle of a plowed field just south of Fort Gerry for two and a half, almost three days. With the blowing snow, and the cold 22 below temperature, John Sameson's machine would not start. In years gone by, they got all drivers, when they get out there, if they would like (mumbles). This year they made the drivers wait. This is John French with another report of the Winnipeg to St. Paul 500. (radio trails off) - Howdy, can I help you? - Fill 'er up. - Excuse me? - Fill 'er up! Yeah, fill it up will ya? Look, just stop at five all right? - Okay. - Are you going to St. Paul? - [Jennifer] Yeah. - Can you drive a car? - Why? - Well I got a little problem maybe you can help me with, I need someone to drive my car to St. Paul. I'll pay the gas and I'll give you $20. - That's all? Just drive it to St. Paul and leave it? - Would help a lot. What do you got to lose? - Yeah. Okay. Where's your car? - Right outside. Can I help you with your stuff? - No, I got it. - Thanks. What's your name? - Jennifer. - I'm Randy Sorenson, let me take that, I'll put it in the back. Okay. (car revs) (soft rock music) - Where are we going? - Huh? - St. Paul is south. I think we're heading north. - Oh gee, I thought I told you, you gotta drop me off in Winnipeg. - Winnipeg? - Yeah. I'm in the Winnipeg to St. Paul snowmobile race and you gotta drop me off at the starting line and take this car and leave it at the finish line in St. Paul. 'Cause I can't drive them both. - Oh, I see. (laughs) That's fine. I've never seen Winnipeg. Racing, is that what you do? - Yeah, that's all I do. That's enough. - You won many? - Well not as many as I'm going to. ♫ And where will you go if you don't get off again ♫ Montana, oh you're my lady - That's where it all ends. Montana. The last race of the year. - And then what do you do? - I don't know, motorcycles maybe, I'll just throw that sled into a ditch. Get a bike and head south. Anything with handlebars and a motor. - [Radio Host] And let's rejoin John now in his mobile unit live, John you have some additional information. (brakes screech) - [Randy] Look at that! I gotta stop here for a minute, there's something I gotta do. (slow rhythmic drumming) (crowd cheering) (snowmobile revs) (upbeat funk music) - Come on. Come on! (laughs) Come on, Randy! Come on! (laughs) Go, go for it! Come on Randy, come on, go Randy! All right, all right, come on, go go go! Come on Randy, come on, move that thing! Go go! All right, way to go! (claps) (laughs) Go go! (laughs) - They loved it! They really love it! - They sure did! - I got a lot of the field, just blowing them off the track. - You're so impressive, no doubt about that. You make running look easy. - It is, it is! You just let the rest of them eat snow, that's what it's all about! Just get so far out in front you never have to look back. Just grab the throttle and let 'er buck! Man that's a great feeling, that machine just humming. Feels like the gas liner's stuck right up your arm, just pumping your heart. Just pumping, come on Winnipeg! I don't see how I can lose another race this year. - Not against that competition anyway. (laughs) - Yeah. But Winnipeg ain't gonna be that easy. (car revs) (gentle piano music) There's no sense driving into St. Paul tonight. I'll get you a motel room and you can leave in the morning and that'll be better anyhow. Then you can drop me off at the starting line. - [Jennifer] That's fine. I'd like to see a real race. - [Randy] Well you will see a real race tomorrow. Because the Winnipeg isn't like that cherry picker back there. (knocking) - [Jennifer] Randy? Hi. - Hi. - [Jennifer] What is that thing anyway? - It's to protect my face against frostbite. - Frostbite? What kind of a race is this? - Well tomorrow I gotta ride about 200 miles. It'll be 20 below, windy, bumpy. You gotta wear these 'cause you always bump into things. - [Jennifer] You gotta be crazy. - Well if I am, I ain't alone. 'Cause last year about 300 guys started and only about 20 of them finished. That is what makes it worthwhile. 'Cause it ain't something that anyone can do. Aim to win. And I will. I swear. That's everything. - Will you win a lot of money? - Yeah. Yeah, but that's not what counts. It's taking it on. Not just the racing part. Being able to take it on, that's what really counts. I mean the cold, the spills, the getting hurt. The hell. That's always gonna happen. This and not quitting. And not giving up, that's what really counts. You take it on, see, you take it on and you do it no matter what. That says it. You don't quit. They want you to. The minute they fear you can do it. They want you to fail. Running high, fall apart, but you just can't, you can't, you just can't. No, never. Never ever. That's why I want this race. I'm ready. I'm really ready. And not just to finish, but to win. That says it. Then that says it. - I didn't think it was that important. - Maybe it isn't. I guess I'm just psyching myself up. - Yeah. Look, I'm hungry. Are you hungry? - I still got some stuff to do here. - Well give me the car keys and I'll go out for something, chicken, beer? - Yeah, they're right on the table. - [Jennifer] I'll be right back okay? - Yeah. (door closes) (car revs) (dramatic synthesizer music) - Randy? Randy? (heavy breathing) (easy listening music) - [Radio Host] Good evening. Sports tops the news tonight. The Winnipeg to St. Paul snowmobile race upheld its reputation for toughness today when 374 drivers from all over North America started off from Winnipeg, Manitoba in the 500 miles endurance run to St. Paul, Minnesota. For a report, here's Bob Johnson. - [Bob Johnson] The temperature was 28 degrees below zero, the wind was from the south gusting to 40 miles per hour. Blowing snow reduced visibility to near zero. Race officials considered canceling the race, but as those discussions were going on the wind died, the sky cleared, and after a 30 minute delay the starter's flag dropped and 374 drivers charged off for St. Paul. Most of the running was in the ditches next to the highway. The wind had created rock hard drifts and these, along with the extreme temperatures, began to take their toll. These machines are capable of speeds over 80 miles per hour, but those few drivers who push to that speed soon paid the price. A score were injured in spills or by hitting fence posts and guide wires which are all too prevalent along the course. At least three drivers have been hospitalized, driving into the 20 below temperature gave nearly every driver frostbite, but only a few needed treatment. The best way to describe today's race is with the statistics. Out of the 374 who started, less than 50 finished. Now that the race is over, the winner is still unannounced as officials continue to try and sort things out. It looks from here like we won't so much have a winner as a survivor. All in all, this has been a very rough day for what has become the toughest snowmobile race in the country. This is Bob Johnson reporting. - [Radio Host] We'll check on today's activities in Washington, a report that the governor may have decided to run for the Senate. (dramatic synthesizer music) - You're gonna do it. You're gonna do it. That's it. There's no quitting. There's no waiting. Can't wait. Can't quit, can't fail. Then dad will see it. Dad will see it. (ominous atmosphere music) (knocking) Jennifer! Let's go, we're late! - Doesn't look like you can breathe in that thing. - It keeps my goggles from fogging up. Let's go, we're late. - I was watching television last night and they had a report on about the race. - Yeah. They make a big deal out of it don't they? (Jennifer laughs) - Yeah they do, I guess. But... But Randy, the guy said that the race was-- - [Randy] That's it, right up there! - Where? - Here, that's it, that's the starting line! - [Jennifer] Oh. - Right here. Good Jennifer! - Randy, what was I was trying to talk to you about in the car. - What? - Could you just stop all that and just listen to me for a minute? - Yeah, of course. - Okay, what I was trying to tell about in the car is that I was watching the news last night. (snowmobile revs) Randy! This doesn't make any sense! - Yeah? Well that's racing. (laughs) - Either this is the all time put-on, or that guy is crazy. (car revs) (rhythmic snare drumming) (acoustic guitar music) Come on, come on. Come on. Will you move? Come on and move that thing. (Jennifer laughs) - [Jennifer] You did it! You won, you won! - What, what the hell are you doing here? - Boy that was really exciting. - I'm still 500 miles from the finish line, I just blew a belt. - Nah, I saw the finish line back there. You won, now come on. - [Randy] Are you crazy, will you please get away from me or I'll be disqualified! - How can they disqualify the winner? No champagne? We'll toast with beer! - I'm losing time. You're driving me crazy, you! - I'm the one crazy, let's go celebrate okay? - [Randy] Yeah. - Come on, let's go, let's go! - We're going, just move over there. - Please, come on, let's get outta here. - I am, I am. (snowmobile revs) - Randy! The race is over! Randy, there is no race! You're doing all this for nothing! (suspenseful acoustic guitar music) Oh! (gasps) Yeah, would you connect me with the sheriff. Look, this is an emergency. (phone buzzes) - Sheriff's office, Deputy Reese. - Yeah, hello. Look, I need some help from you. - [Ronnie] What is your name please? - Jennifer, Jennifer Mackey. - [Ronnie] Now may I help you? - Yeah, I hope you can help me, you see there's this guy and he is riding around in the ditches around here and he thinks he's in a race, a snowmobile race. - [Ronnie] Nothing the matter with that really. - No, you don't understand, I mean this guy, he really believes that he is in a race and I want you to go out and stop him. - Just how do you propose we do that, ma'am? - I don't know how! I got it, okay, go out, find him and tell him he's disqualified from the race. Just tell him that he's disqualified. - From what race? - From the snowmobile race that he thinks he's in! You gotta find him and tell him that, I think he'll believe you. - What's that all about? - I'm not sure. Something about a guy in a snowmobile race, either he's crazy or this girl thinks he's crazy or they're both crazy. Ma'am, can you come in here and fill out a report? - [Jennifer] Oh come on! Listen, that guy could be nuts, would you please go out and find him? - Hey Ronnie, she know the guy's name? - What is the man's name? - [Jennifer] Randy Sorenson. - Sorenson. Randy Sorenson. - All right, get a location. That's the guy the army's been looking for. - Where is the man now? - [Jennifer] I don't know. - Well then where are you? - [Jennifer] I have no idea where I am. - Just tell me what you see, describe the buildings. - All right, it's a four way intersection and there's two white stores and the other two lots are empty. - Sounds like Wannaska. - That close? All right, I'll take the squad, you call Ned and have him get his plane in the air. If Sorenson leaves the ditches, that's the only way we'll be able to spot him. - Hey what's this guy done? - I don't know, but the army says if he doesn't get these pills he'll become irrational, whatever that means. - Has he done anything to you? - No, he hasn't done anything to me! But he's out riding around in these ditches and he thinks he's in a race and he doesn't know what he's doing! - All right, now just take it easy. We'll find him. (suspenseful acoustic guitar music) (car revs) (snowmobile revs) - [Ronnie] 36, this is Control. - Go ahead, Ronnie. - [Ronnie] Ned has left the field, should be in the air in a couple of minutes. - Well there's so many tracks in these ditches it's hard to tell whether he's been this way or not. - [Ronnie] The girl thinks he's driving to St. Paul. - St. Paul? Well then he's gonna have to leave the ditches and come out at 32. Look, call Ned and have him check the area around (mumbles), I'll cut across and pick him up when he comes out. - [Ronnie] Air One, this is Control. - [Ned] This is Air One Control, I copy 36. (upbeat synthesizer music) (electric guitar accompaniment) - [Ronnie] Air One, this is Control. - Stand by, Ronnie. 36, this is Air One. Jim, there's something out here. I'm checking. (loud crash) (engine whirring) (engine dies) (helicopter whirring) - [Radio Host] 72 degrees in Minneapolis, St. Paul, looking for a high today of around 85. Here's Dale Menten. ♫ It was cold as I stepped down from the train ♫ My boxcar hideaway was open to the rain ♫ How far does the train go if I ride on to its end ♫ And where will I go if I don't get on again ♫ Montana, oh you're my lady ♫ Could you take me for your own ♫ Montana, you know lately ♫ I've been thinking about finally coming home - Here's my ride. Bob. I wanna thank you for coming so far out of your way and for all your help. - Well Randy, I'm beginning to wonder how much help I really was. I think I may have been taking the easiest way. See, I was using medication as crutches to prop you up hoping they'd keep things from knocking you over. Maybe I should've been helping you get strong enough to deal with things on your own. What bothers me most is that maybe you were strong enough and I just made you weaker. - Bob, don't let this place get you down. (marching drum music) - [Bob] Randy, do you know what you're gonna do? - I don't know what I'm gonna do, Bob. But I know how I'm gonna do it. - [Bob] Well keep in touch. - Sure Bob. ♫ I don't know where I'm going ♫ I don't know where I've been ♫ But the hour's quickly coming ♫ When I say goodbye to another road and another friend ♫ I'm gonna be leaving again ♫ 'Cause there's love in this country ♫ Oh there's love in this land ♫ It's where the sun puts out the evening ♫ And the snow cleans off the land - Boo!

(laughter) ♫ There's a mood in the air and it's coming on ♫ Faster than a pushing plow, ooh I got to move it now ♫ Get it on, get it up, get it out of my way ♫ I can't stay ♫ I'm gonna look until I find it ♫ It's in a town or a face or just along the highway ♫ I'm gonna look until I find it ♫ 'Cause I know there's a chance that it's coming my way ♫ Oh I just can't stay ♫ Oh Lord I just can't stay ♫ You know this feeling so strong ♫ I can't push it away ♫ 'Cause there's love in this country ♫ Oh there's love in this land ♫ It's where the sun turns on the morning ♫ And the snow cleans off the land ♫ But there's love in this country ♫ There's love in this land ♫ So take your hand from off my shoulder ♫ You see I'm strong enough, strong enough to stand ♫ Shall I pack your bags for you ♫ Should we leave on a midnight train ♫ Bound for nowhere special ♫ But we're bound for nothing better if we choose to stay ♫ I can't stay ♫ I'm gonna look until I find it ♫ It's in a town or a face or just along the highway ♫ I'm gonna look until I find it ♫ 'Cause I know there's a chance that it's coming my way ♫ I just can't stay ♫ Oh Lord I just can't stay ♫ You know this feeling so strong ♫ I can't push it away ♫ There's love in this country ♫ There's love in this land ♫ It's where the sun puts out the evening ♫ And the snow cleans off the land ♫ There's love in this country ♫ My God there's love in this land ♫ So take your hand from off my shoulder ♫ You see I'm strong enough, strong enough to stand
