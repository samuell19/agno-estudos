(thundering hooves, echoing) (crowd roars, echoing) (crowd cheering) Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! (yells) (gasps) -(horses grunting) -(wheel creaking) Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! (both gasping) (crowd cheering) (yelps) (cheers, fading) (camcorder beeps) (man) Egypt. A land of mystery, intrigue and rich history. Today I, the world-renowned archeologist, Lord Sylvester Carnaby, -present to you... -('Psycho' theme playing) (groans) Hold on. -Mummy, I'm... -Sylvester! -I can't talk. -Where have you been? I haven't heard a peep from you. Listen, I can't talk right now, I have a date with... A date? Oh, my God. -No, a date with history! -At last! I bet she's pretty. -Oh, dear. -And wealthy, too... (mimics static) Oh, I'm losing you... Oh, terrible signal... -Hello! Hello! Hel- -Oh, drat! On the other side of this door, lies the tomb of Princess Nefer. (grunting) (gasps) (grunting) No, it can't be. (both) Wow! -'Wow'? (grunts) -(both yelp) It's empty! The Mummy isn't here. -Let me see! -No! -Get back. -I got next! -You're always like this. -No, you! You and your grasping arms... -What's this? Look. -Stop it! -Look at this. -Ha-hah! Oh! Lord Carnaby. It seems to speak of... -(man) Hello? -A bridge... Can someone let me out, please? I don't like it in here. From the world of the living to the afterlife. A doorway of sorts to... a city! A city where the mummies reside in the afterlife. A world of mummies... under the earth. (grunting) -(yelps) -What...? You two. Get the equipment. Oh! (shrieking) I've found something! Huh? (blowing whistle) (laughing) (crowd chattering excitedly) Thank you. I love you too. (blowing kisses) With love... Thut the Charioteer. (exclaiming) (Thut gasps) Can I? Sure. Oh! (chuckles) (woman giggles) Why did you stop racing? You're so young. Oh, you know, I just want to give others a chance to win. (all laughing) Why haven't you found that special girl -to settle down with? Hmm? -(nervous chuckle) Well, marriage is forever and us mummies live forever, so I think... not for me. (giggling) -(fan) You rock! -(fan 2) Whoo-hoo! -(fan 3) Hey, Thut! -(fan 4) We love you, Thut! What you doing, little brother? Thut's big return! You saw all the fans you still have at the papyrus shop. -(faint yelling) -(thundering hooves) No! I can't. Yes, you can. You're the champ! I was the champ. Not anymore. (sighs) I can't go back. Just go home, Sekhem. I'll get us some food. -(indictinct chatter) -Oh! There you go, my friend. -See you next week. -Yeah, see you next week. (hooves clattering) Huh? -Stop, madam! -Oh! Oh! (horses whinnying) Oh, you're very kind. -(chuckles modestly) -(gasps) My basket! No worries! I got it. -(gasps, yelling) -(horse whinnying) -(Thut yelps) -(screaming) (both grunt) Don't you know to look first, before crossing the street? Don't you see people crossing? You had to stop! I was first. I was the one crossing first! You had to stop. Next time, look first! Hyah! (scoffs) They'll give anyone a driving papyrus these days. Mm? Here we are. Don't forget your basket. Oh, thank you very much. (birds twittering) (gasps) Always, always the same. This city's nice But it's underground I've lost the music In all this sound Day after day With no hint of a change The monotony's Wearing me down Thousands of years Of the same old song And they expect me To sing along I'm eager to hear Any new melody Could a good dancing rhythm Be wrong So I will rise Beyond this tomb Where I can shine And be made new Where I can thrive Under the sun A place to call my home Open my eyes Singing my song Staying awake But dreaming on Living a life that is my own A thousand years from now -(woman) Ahem! -(record scratching) (gasping) (chuckles) -Princess, where have you been? -(maidens giggling) Oh, um... I... I needed some fresh air. Oh, Ra be merciful! Usi, this place hasn't changed in thousands of years. We need change. (sighs) What would your father say if he hears you singing? You will soon be named the official successor of the Pharaoh. Singing is for entertainers, not for the rulers of our world. -Shh! You can't tell him! -Mm... (sighing) All right. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! The last thing we need is to make your father suspicious. (clearing throat) Suspicious of what? Dad! Of, um... Well, uh... Her new suitor. (strained chuckle) My... new suitor? Mm. Did you forget? (chuckles) Um... Today, my daughter, the Phoenix Bird, guided by Hathor, the Goddess of Love, will choose your future husband. Today? Uh, what do you mean, today? That was not in my schedule. Where is my schedule, please? Dad! Sorry, sorry, I mean, Great Pharaoh. I need at least a hundred more years before I get engaged! What if... What if I don't like him? What if we don't get along? What if... (sighs) Father, I am not having a bird decide who I marry. You know what? I don't want to get married! -(brooch clatters) -(all gasping) It isn't just any bird! It's a Phoenix Bird. Sent by the Goddess of Love herself! (sighs) Dad, come on. The two thousands are the new one thousands. So, I'm still pretty young. I have other priorities in my life. Priorities? Being a princess, that is your duty! And that includes marriage. (sighs) I know you are nervous, but you will see, the Goddess has someone handsome and exciting in mind for you. (staff thumping) The Goddess Hathor shall guide the majestic Phoenix through our kingdom. Let us open the Stargate for the Phoenix! (voice echoing) (crowd murmuring) (all gasping in awe) (high-pitched squeaking) Aww! (giggles) Oh! Uh... Sorry. Wrong recipe. (squeaking) (loud shrieking) (crowd exclaiming) Now, glorious Phoenix! -Take flight! -(phoenix calling loudly) We await your destiny. (builders hammering) (both yelping) (stone cracking) -Watch out! -Hey! (yelling) The Great Sekhem, the undefeated boomer... Uh... boomerang, uh... boomerang guy! (aristocrat) Mmm... Ooh! Looks like it found someone. (grunting) -(sizzling) -Huh? (shrieking) Oh, false alarm. Ah-ha! (grunts) -(squawks) -Oh, no. -The Phoenix Bird has chosen! -Are you sure? It swooped down towards a house. (phoenix squawking) Ow! (sighs) Huh! (blowing) Hmm... (clearing throat) Sorry, signing was from five to seven. (Thut) Uh, uh... So... excuse me, where are we going? Do you... do you know who I am? Hello? Hello? Am I talking to myself here? Could you please put me down? What is it the...? -I don't believe it. Him? -I don't mean to be rude, but could somebody please tell me... (yelps) Pharaoh! Rise, young man. I know you. You are Thut the Charioteer, yes? Ex-charioteer, Your Majesty. An ex-charioteer? I have to marry a guy whose only talent -is riding around in a circle? -(clears throat) Young Thut. Today is a joyous day indeed, for the Goddess has chosen you. (all cheering) (chuckles) Thanks. Cheers. Thank you. In seven days, you shall wed the Princess Nefer! Wed? (nervous chuckle) Hold on. As in marry? We've never even met. (gasps) The crazy driver! Sorry. This is crazy. Marry the princess? This is a lot. I mean, so many things to consider. Like, are we compatible? And that I'm allergic to marriage. Diagnosed, in fact. Ah-choo! Ah-choo! He's right, Dad, he's right! Sorry, I mean, um, Great Pharaoh. If you go against the Goddess' wishes, they will cut out your tongue and pluck out your eyes. Both eyes? Kind of brings new meaning to the expression 'Love is blind.' (chuckles) Oh, who doesn't love marriage? Nefer, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you! Where were we honeymooning again? Could you do the pluck out of the eyes to me so that I don't have to see this? (chuckles, smooching) Enough! It is now your duty to safeguard this ring until the day of the wedding. If anything happens to it... -they'll cut out... -Loud and clear. Eyes and tongue punishment thing. -Destiny has been written. -(all cheering) Let us leave the bride and groom to get to know each other. (birds twittering) (sighs) What did you say your name was? Uh, Thut the Charioteer. Whatever. Let's just get some things straight, okay? Don't go getting emotionally involved because... Hey, stop, Princess. Honestly, you're not my type. Oh, what a relief. Because I wouldn't go out with you if you were the last mummy on earth. So thanks for saving me the trouble. (mocking, scoffs) Well, you make an eternity feel like... uh, an eternity. Why am I even wasting my time talking to you? The woman who needs a deranged pigeon to find her a husband. Oh, it is not a pigeon. (pompous tone) It's a Phoenix Bird! Sent by the Goddess of Love herself! (chuckles) Oh. You... you smile. -Uh... -Listen, obviously, there has been some kind of mistake. Oh! -Mmm. -(awkward chuckle) Your dad seems like a reasonable Pharaoh, right? He... can be. Look, why don't you just back out? They'd only scoop out your eyes and cut out your tongue, and then you'd talk less! So, win-win. Ah, this is getting dark. Hey, shouldn't it be night time by now? Oh, you're right! Usi! (telephone ringing) (gasping) Y-yes? Operator, it should be night time. Eh? (yelps) Quickly, quickly! Night! (men gasping) (grunting) (wheel rumbling) (groaning with effort) (sparks buzzing) Shooting star, please. I think I could get used to this. Well, you won't have to. So... Thanks for coming by, though. A shame you have to go. Hmm... Hm. So, I'll... see you at the wedding? Oh, I can't wait. Uh, well, neither can I. Oh, yeah? Well, I really can't wait to marry you. I'm just so excited to marry a charioteer! Oh, yeah? Well, I can't wait to marry you and love you forever and cherish you for all eternity! -Fine! -Fine! (scoffs, mocking) The shooting star was a bit much, don't you think? Oh, he seemed nice. Nice? (scoffs) Please... Mm. (Croc grunting) Well? What did they want? I was afraid they were going to execute you. No. It's worse than that. They want me to get married. Married? You? -(giggling) -(laughing) (groans) I would lose all my freedom. I'm pro-single! How can I be pro-single and married at the same time? -It's impossible! -(gasps) Listen, brother. Let's keep the Thut myth alive. Nobody can know what I really am. Not even the princess. Wait. Did you say 'the princess'? That's awesome! We're gonna be rich! Like, forever! And live in the palace! And have servants that will... will wipe our rooms for us. Princess or not, I don't want to get married. No matter how many people might clean for me. Whoa, is that the wedding ring? It's huge! -Here, let me have it. -No. -(shrieks) -(laughs) Wow! -It's heavy! -Yeah, like a ball and chain. Sekhem, do you take this Croc to be your lawfully wedded crocodile? Would you give that back? My life depends on this ring. I'm not even gonna keep it at home. This ring is going where nobody else can get to it. Wow! Your trophies! -(laughs) -Don't touch anything. Understood? It will be safe here. Okay, let's go. (stone door rumbling) (muffled thudding) (bot chittering) (cackling) Would you look at that? It is full of wonderful things! -Um, is it my turn now? -No, I go next. -No, cause it's mine. -You're always like this. -I... go... next! -Stop it! This is serious archaeology. -('Psycho' theme playing) -(groans) Mother! You'll never guess what... -(snickering) -(angry grunt) Ow! -Ah! -Careful, you... (electronic chittering) -(both grunting) -You! (both yelping) What on earth do you think you're doing? Huh? (both whimpering) You only had to hold on to the tablet and not touch anything. -I gave you one job! -(both yelping) -You great big nincom... -(tablet chimes) -Wait. What's that? -Huh? Oh, go on then. Ohh! A royal wedding ring. Oh, yes! What the... (growling) Mm! (cackling) -(distant booming) -(both exclaim) Aah! (Nefer) The charioteer? (Thut) No, no. What happened? (shrieks) The ring, where's the ring? It's gone! It's disappeared! -Gah! -(grunts) By the god Ra, this could only be the work of... (gasps) Livings! This will be the jewel of my new exhibition. Call the royal guard! And tell them I lost the ring? Are you nuts? It's just a ring. Buy another one. It's the Ring. Don't you get it? If I don't find it they'll cut out my tongue and scoop out my eyes. The only way to get it back is to go to... the world of the living. Really? Great! What an adventure! Adventure? It's dangerous! Ahem! You're not alone. You have a team. There is no way you are coming. They are mummy robbers. We created this inner city to be protected from them. Listen, brother. Either I come with you or I tell the Pharaoh. (sighing) May the gods protect us. (Croc grunting) (Croc grunts) -Sekhem! -(yelps) We have to avoid the white strong white light. It would reveal our true nature to the living. (Croc grunting happily) (vehicle approaching) -Look out! -Whoa! (gasps) What was that? A giant chariot. But where are the horses? Thut! -(trucks beeping) -(engines rumbling) There! They've got the ring! -Whoa! -Nice one, Lord... Shut up, would you? Just do your jobs. (both straining, grunting) The ring! This will be easier than I thought. Wait here. (worker) Right now, get that thing over there, and shove it over there. (worker 2) Right, there's no space over there. (grunts) Sekhem! What are you doing here? Look! The ring is in that other steel beast! What do you mean? Which other one? Quickly! The beasts are migrating! (both grunting with effort) (Sekhem) Thut, come on! Thut! Pull yourself up! (yells) -(Sekhem) What's happened to you? -Uh, this is going too fast. -No. Focus on your mission. -(panting) That's it, thinking about the ring. Should be nice and easy. Open the crate, take the ring, I keep my eyes. Hmm... This could take a while. Nothing. It must be in one of the other... (all yelling) Time to unload! Someone's coming! Quick, hide! (Thut groans) -Go! -Where are we? Don't worry. Everything is gonna be all right. The sooner we find the ring, the sooner we're home. Quickly! No time to lose. -(metal creaking) -Shh! We're not alone. (loud, metalic clank) Oh, what? You? -(Nefer yells) -(yelps) Ha-ha! Whoa! Uh-oh! (both grunt) -Princess! -(Nefer) Help. (Thut groans) (Sekhem clears throat) (sighs) Huh? Oh. Princess Nefer's here. Wait a minute, Princess Nefer? Why are you here? Uh, the question... is why are you here? Running away? Running away? (scoffs) Are you kidding? Thut runs from nobody! He's the bravest. Although, he did lose the ring. -Sekhem! -Lost the ring? No, but that's great! Then we don't have to get married! No, that's not great! That's not great at all! -They're gonna take my eyes! -But think: Eyes... eternal marriage. Eyes... eternal marriage. Come on! They're not that nice. You still got four other senses. They take my tongue, too. Then you still have three other senses. Enough. I don't wanna talk about it. Let's get out of here. (Thut sighs, grunts) Mm-mm. It's locked from the outside. We are stuck in here. Oh, yeah? That's what you think. Watch and learn. (loud clang) (groans) (Nefer) And I pass into the afterlife! -I win! -Congrats, you beat a kid. (mocking) Nah, nah, nah-nah, nah! (Thut groans) -How long have I been out? -All night. Should I tell him? Or you? -You! You're his brother. -You're the princess. -So? -And his fiancée. Oh, come on, that doesn't count! Um, I'm not... Agh! Hey! Oh, sweet Mother of Horus. That's the sea! (Nefer) Oh, well done, genius. Well, excuse me, Princess. Maybe we wouldn't be here if you hadn't hit me with a... Oh, come on, would you relax? If we escape now, we'll be lost at sea. We have to wait until we get to land. (mocking) (loud snoring) (snoring continues) Croc. Shut up. Croc! Thank you. (snoring resumes) Gah! (snoring loudly) A princess who snores? And I bet she farts. (groans) (grunts in pain) (bell tolling) DOCK (worker) That's it. Lower, lower. Come on! Let's go. We have to find the ring. (yelps) -Uh! -(grunts) (Sekhem) Whoa-ho-ho! -Ha-ha! -(Thut) Sekhem! (Sekhem yelps) Oh, my Osiris. What place is this? Amun, I've never seen anything like it. -Babylon! -No, this is way bigger. There's only one power that could surpass Egypt. (gasps) The Roman Empire! Exactly. Guys, we are in Rome. ('Rule Britannia' playing) (flash bulb pops) Hey, look at that! (Thut) It's the man, the man who took the ring. -Give it here. Give it! -No, I go next! -You shut your cake hole! -Careful! I'm not the uncareful one. No! Mine! Mine! Be quiet! Just put it down. Now. (yelling in pain) -(both gasping) -You stupid... (phone playing 'Psycho' theme) (grunts) Mother! -(giggles) -The theater? Of course, Mother, how could I forget? Why didn't you idiots remind me I had tickets to the theater today? I'm on my way, Mummy. To the theater. (laughs nervously) (tires screeching) Quick! Hide! (gasps) Uh... Huh? -(chuckling) Yeah. -(laughs) Oh, I love Romans! (giggles) -¿Has visto? Te encantará. -Sí, claro. (gasping) (man) ¿Cómo? (gasps) ¡Mirad! Son ellos. -(woman) ¡No creo! -(man) ¡Es verdad! (Thut) What are those light rays? -They're stealing our souls! -(Thut screams) (all screaming) (loud clang) (sighing) -Is everyone okay? -I'm all right! Me, too. -(Nefer gasps) -Ahem! Ah! The gods are protecting us! We're saved! Look! They left their weapons! Come on, nothing can stop us. (mother) Hm! Sylvester! You're late. But I don't mind because you'll always be my little one! Oh, Mummy, please. Not in public. No... Mummy don't, please. There. That's better. Quick! Before he walks into that brightly lit structure! (camera shutter clicking) Hey, what are you doing here? Ha-hah! Step back, Roman! Uh... Wha... These weapons are useless! Okay, okay. Your Instagram stuff is done. The front door is for the audience, honey. -C'mon, here we go. Stage door. -(all exclaiming) -Spit spot! -Excuse me. Hey! -What? -(gasps) Oh! Whoa! (laughs) This is a strange Egyptian colony. Stay with me. I'll protect you. -Hey, dears, hurry up! -(both yelping) No! Wait. We're looking for Hathor's ring! I demand that you tell me where it is! (chuckles) You're in character. I like it. Approved. Now go and wait for your cue! (yells) Oh! Uh... Hey. -That one is such a diva. -Oh, yes. Um, does this colony have a Pharaoh? You're talking to him, honey. -Ready. -(bell ringing) Hey, dears!

That's very kind of you. But we have to start again, and time is running out. We can't do anything now. Let's rest and we'll find the ring in the morning. Ed's a nice guy. He offered to take us home.

She snores. Like a walrus. (sighing) Uh, what's going on? The singer that ruined the play. She was wearing a symbol. The same symbol -that is in the ring. -So? So the legend behind the ring is true. Um... -(clears throat) -Oh! She has come back to get her ring. And I have it. (cackles softly) What could be a more amazing discovery than an undiscovered royal Egyptian ring? Uh, two undiscovered royal Egyptian rings! Two? There are two? Amazing. No, you morons! I'm talking about a living mummy! (phone voice) Calling Mummy. (gasps) Calling Mummy. Sylvester! Mummy? I can't talk now. What? Don't you want to talk to your mother? Oh, no, no. No, Mummy, it's not that. We don't need the phone because... I'm right beside you!

Will I fit in there? (laughing) I love your sense of humor! No, not you! It is a 'streaming.' 'Live Internet'? (scoffs) You don't get it, dude. -(gasps) -You are going to slay. Slay? It means do a good job, right bro? I don't think this is a good idea. It's the first time someone has ever asked me to sing. -But Nefer... -Thut! Time is running out. (sighing) I have fought all my life to make my own decisions. (sighs) Then make this decision. I'll support you. (chuckles) Wow. Thanks, Thut. That means a lot. Well, do your thing. (chuckles) Yeah, um... I guess I'll just, uh... do it. Gimme five! Up top! Hah! Yeah! Yeah! (nervous giggle) I'm afraid I'm slipping away I'm going to waste I'm never gonna change Don't wanna leave the world The way that's it's now I don't wanna miss any good Chance to feel proud Just raise your hands now Just raise your hands and sing Bah-bah, bah-bah Bah-bah, bah-bah-bah But you can't seize me You can redeem me You've got the keys To free me So don't delay I'm today Yesterday's tomorrow I'm today The time you borrowed I'm today the stars align Don't pass me by 'Cause I'm today Yesterday's tomorrow I'm today The time you borrowed I'm today the stars align Don't pass me by (reporter, on T.V.) This mystery girl has managed to score over ten million hits across the globe. The girl that shocked audiences on the West End has now revealed herself to the world, and she's not stopping there. Reporting live from the Commons at Knightsbridge, I'm George Towers. We've got her! (all laughing) (cackling echoes) (Croc grunting happily) (chuckles) (contented sigh) (sighs) You know what? Perhaps this is my place. I've only been here a few days and already my dreams are coming true. That's... really good... for you. Oh, come on, you'll be fine. I gave you my word I would help you find the ring and I will. We'll find it. (grunting happily) (sighs) -(toy squeaking) -He's not like the rest. -(purring) -Maybe we... Come on, what am I saying? -(grunts in alarm) -I know, I know. We're from two different worlds, anyway. -(grunts) -(Nefer gasps) (grunting in alarm) (grunts loudly) -Croc! It's Croc! -(gasps) Something's wrong with him! (both gasp) Nefer! Nefer! No! (gasping) (grunts) (tires screeching) (straining) (yelling) Nefer! Where are they taking her? I recognize those men. They're the ones who took the ring from the ship. We need to follow that chariot. It belongs to the Carnaby Museum. How did you know that? Are you in on this? -Was this your plan all along? -What? In on this? The van belongs to the Carnaby Museum. It said it on the side! I blame you for this, Ed. So stay out of my way, got it? I'll get to that museum. I've got a princess to save. You're crazy. You'll never get in. Their security is mental! No. You stay here. It's dangerous. I'm your brother and you will obey me. (crickets chirping) (water trickling) (Usi) Princess... (groans) -(chain clanks) -Ahh! (grunts) (Usi, echoing) Princess... Princess Nefer. So delightful to meet you. Let me... (grunts) Let me go. Unfortunately, I can't do that. This morning is the opening of my greatest exhibition yet. (exclaims) Originally the centerpiece was going to be your ring. But now... you. You are my greatest discovery. And when I reveal you to the world, yours won't be the only name that goes down in history. And if you thought your little song made you famous, wait until they find out what you really are! (Nefer, weakly) You can't do this. -Thut will... -I can see you! -He will come for me. -(chuckles lightly) There you are! That's what will sell the most tickets. Now... if you'll excuse me, I've an exhibition to prepare. (chuckling deeply) Wait, this is all my stuff! Wow, an entire section dedicated to me. 'The treasures of Thut the Fleet of Foot.' (chuckles) What a nickname! Hmm? One hundred-time chariot racing champion? What? It's 112 plus one. (scoffs) Idiots. (Nefer moaning) Nefer? -Nefer! -(groans weakly) Oh, no. What have they done to you? (Carnaby) You look like humans, but you're really ancient Egyptian mummies. -You! -Welcome to your new home. -(Danny cackling) -Not so fast! Huh? (grunts) (yells) (grunts, moans) (exclaims, groaning) (muffled pop music playing) (grunting) (chittering) (grunts sadly) (yelps) (coercing grunt) Look, bro. I can help. Let's rescue the grumpy guy. Really? Ha... (grunting) I can't. Oh, jeez. I'm in bad shape. Don't worry. You stay here, watching. Hold it. I see a hawk. Shh! You sure this is okay, Danny? Lord Carnaby said not to leave the princess unattended. (sighs) We're the only ones in the building. Besides, how can we protect the princess on an empty stomach? Uh, all right. Makes sense. Huh? Uh-oh. What have we done? Hmm. Umm... Ah-ha! Perfect. (Danny grunting) (startled yelp) -(Thut laughs drunkenly) -Thut? (giggling) You know what? I think you're cute. (slurring) Thanks. You're pretty. We've got to get them out, quick! I told you to keep watch over the princess. Sorry, Mr. Carnaby. You see, we wanted some snacks and... Then we got stuck in the vending machine. (groans) -(Danny grunts) -Mm-hm. (groaning) Mmm. -(muffled thud) -What was that? (gasps) It's coming from the exhibition. -It's the princess! -(humming) Don't just stand there, you blithering idiots! My... my chocky bar is... Get the princess! (loud grunt) Are you okay? -(Thut giggling) -Hey, Thut... Sekhem is so... so hero-ish. Thanks. He learned it all from me. Okay, come on. (both giggling drunkenly) Someone's been here. Keep your eyes peeled. -(Thut giggles) -(gasps) It's them! Quick, hide! (Thut whimpers) (Nefer, slurring) I is a... I'm a woman, and I can stand on my own two feet. -(exclaiming) -Huh? What was that? -Wha...? -Hm. (quietly) Did I tell you that you're cute? Yeah, I... I feel very strongly that you... Ew! They're kissing! Blech! The ring! No. She's escaped! You fools! You imbeciles! I give you one job... I got it! Let's get out of here. Guys? -(Thut) Ha-ha! -(Nefer) Hoo-hoo! We escaped your little trap! Now, we'll ruin your special little opening day. -(taunting) -Stop! Ha! Sorry about that! Can't take them anywhere. -Go! -Get them. Hey! (groans) (laughs drunkenly) Hah! (grunts aggressively) (yelps, grunts) Come on! Ha-hah! (grunting) (Danny screaming) Hey, look! Let's get that! (darts firing) There they go! Quick! Chariot driver, drive the chariot! Well, I've... never driven a chariot like this. I did! I can do it! -Please! -What, seriously, the kid? -(darts firing) -(both gasp) -Go! -Croc, buddy, get the pedals. Ugh! Get the van! Get the van! (yelling angrily) Where do I go? (female voice) This is the bus to the South Bank. Yeah! Ra is with us! -Ra is a woman? -Got a problem with that? Why are you going so slowly? I'm obeying the rules of the road. -The speed limit is... -Forget the speed limit. Get out of the way. Let me. Right. Here we go. Croc, come on! (electric motors whining) (Thut and Nefer screaming) Slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down! You don't slow down in a chase! Not slowing down is the whole point! I can't... watch! (female voice) Next stop, Russell Square Station. Final destination, South Bank. Ra says to stop next! Do what Ra says! No, he says to stop at the pier! Don't worry, big brother. He who dares wins! Dies! We're gonna die! They won't get away from me. I want my mummy! -Calling Mommy. -I meant that mummy! -Calling Mommy. -No, I know... (mother) Sylvester? What are you doing? Not now, mother! I'm driving! It's not safe to drive and talk on the phone. (yelps) Croc! -(yelling) -Whoa! (Carnaby) I'll show you! I can't shake him. What do I do? Thut! (yelling) See that ramp up ahead? Drive right for it. But that boat, it's already leaving. Then we'd better go faster. Now! Turn and slam the brakes! (tires screeching) (all screaming) -(Carnaby groans) -You made it! Way to go boss! Yeah, but the people we were chasing are back there. -Guess we can't get 'em now. -Shut up, would you? I will chase them to the end of the world if necessary. You haven't seen the last of me! Bye. (all) Yeah! (cheering) -We're safe! -Well done! (groans) You were great, Sekhem. Thanks, big bro. -Are you okay? -Yes. Thank you. (clears throat politely) So, fancy explaining why a chariot racer is frightened of going fast? Oh, that. Oh, well... It's just that I don't feel comfortable driving a chariot with no horses. I don't trust what I can't see. Um... Yeah, look, I'm sorry about... you know... kissing you at the museum, I just... -Oh, yeah. I... -I just wasn't think... -And this dart... -No, I'm sorry for that. I mean, I'm also sorry about the kissing. Yeah, well, good, good, good, that we can be honest with each other. Great chat. Okay, mummies, back to the After World. Let's walk like Egyptians! Yeah. We've only got two suns before the curse falls, and I lose my eyes and tongue. I mean, you know, the usual. Well, let's just use the Stargate. It's over there. (slurring) That's... that's not a Stargate. That's a Ferris Wheel. Oh, so no time travel? Just all the time... at the same place. Oh, Ra. Unless flying like a falcon is a thing in the human world, we're finished. Um, actually, it is. Uh, yeah, wow! -Um, she's gorgeous. -Let me...! -Is that relevant? -No. Wait. Wait for it... Yes! Huh. Wait no. No, no, no, no. (growling) Ah-ha! That one right there! (gasps) The God Horus? Horus himself is gonna take us? Wow! You could be in Egypt in five minutes... Hours! Five hours! -Perfect. -Yes! -(Sekhem) Whoo! -(laughing) (chuckling) Well, I think it's time for you to choose, Princess. (inaudible) (plane roaring overhead) (sighs) ('I'm Today' playing on headphones) (song fades) So... (nervous chuckle) Can you imagine if we'd had to marry? You and me? Huh! We'd be like oil and water. Totally. (forced chuckle) But you know, I... should probably thank you. You were very brave, charioteer. Uh... No. Not at all. In fact, I'm not actually who you think I am. I retired because I got scared. And since then, speed makes me panic. So... no. I'm not brave. Not at all. If you weren't brave, you wouldn't have risked your life to rescue me. You're braver than you think, Thut. (chuckles) Yeah, well... I don't know. (humming melody) -(Danny) Get off! That's mine! -(Dennys) No! (growls) (both grunting) (Danny) Give it here! Give it! (Danny) Look, just 'cause you went to the posh school... (Dennys) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I know who's Mum's favorite. (Carnaby cackling) (Sekhem grunts) (birds twittering) (giggling) Whoo-hoo! (sighs) -So... -You, uh... -Oh. Sorry. No, you... -(chuckling) Uh, well, I suppose... it's goodbye, Princess. Goodbye, charioteer. ('Far Away' by Nickelback playing) (whispering) Turn around. (whispering) Turn around, please. I'm sorry, Father. I was afraid that... You can't imagine how worried I have been. (heavy thudding) (cackling) A city of living mummies. The legend lives. Whoa! It wasn't a legend after all. Not after today, Danny. Not after today. He's Danny, I'm Dennys. Do not ruin the moment. Uh... where is the princess? Princess? Heh! Who needs a princess when you can have a pharaoh? (panting loudly) Sire. They've managed to infiltrate the city using the metal beasts. Take everybody to the shelter. I'll deploy the city's defenses. Go with them. -(muffled thump) -(soldiers screaming) Lord Carnaby requests an audience with the Pharaoh. They took away my exhibition. They scoff at my name. But I will show them a living pharaoh. Then they'll see. (gasps) Nefer, stay back! This is my fault. He followed me here. This is my fight too. (muffled booming) -Thut! Thut! -(Croc grunting) -He's here! -(toy squeaking) The one from the museum, he's come! We're under attack! If he wants to come, let him come. It's that or an eternity signing autographs. Alone. Oh, come on! The princess needs you! (sighs) She's got guards. She needs the bravest among us. The supreme champion. And that's you. 'He who dares.' That's my older brother. That's who I look up to and idolize. Stop feeling sorry for yourself and go help her. (yells) (grunting) (gasps) (both grunting) (cackling) (groaning) Father! No... Father! (yells angrily) (grunting) I don't believe it! (Nefer yells) (laughs) -You're not going anywhere. -Whoa! Whoa! Foolish child! You won't get away with this! You want to come too? Pesky spoiled brat! (both yelling) (shrieking) (Nefer yelling) (groans) (cackling) No. -Thut! -The Charioteer! (growls) (Nefer) He's getting away! Hyah! (grunting) Go, go, go! Croc! (yells, grunts) -(Croc grunts sadly) -(exlaims) (yelping) No! Hyah! (Thut and Nefer yelling) Here we go. (loud grunt) (creaking loudly) Thut, what are you doing? Thut! Look out! (muffled) Thut, come on! You can't let him get away! You are not alone. You have a team. (muffled) Thut! Not now, come on! Snap out of it! Thut! Wake up! Thut! Wake up, I need you! (grunting with effort) It's time to take the reins! -Hyah! Hyah! -Whoo-hoo! (both yelling) (Nefer screams) (both grunting) (both grunting aggressively) Get off me, boy! I've got you now. (gasps) Thut! -(relieved laugh) -No! -(yelps) -Now, you'll be my new trophy. -Nefer! -Thut! I'll show you, mummy! No, no, no, no, no! I love you. -(Thut grunts) -(yells) (Thut yelling) Thut! -(gasps) -(loud booming) -(explosion echoing) -(panting) No, no. Thut! Thut? No! (gasps) Thut! (both straining) Nefer! Father! (chuckling) That's my older brother. (both laughing) Young charioteer, you saved my life. You did it! You overcame your fear, Thut! No, It was you. I've been running from fear this whole time. Whether it was fear to race again or fear to love somebody. The ceremonial ring I'm supposed to return. But instead... Will you marry me? Well, the Phoenix chose you, so technically, I'm duty-bound to marry you. (both laughing) (shyly) Yes, I will! (laughing) The Phoenix was right, you're made for each other. (cracking up) (priest) By the power vested in me by the goddess of love, I pronounce you wife and husband. (cheering, applause) (laughing) (playing 'Walk Like an Egyptian') All the school kids So sick of books They like the punk And the metal band -♪ When the buzzer rings? -♪ Oh-way-oh?
