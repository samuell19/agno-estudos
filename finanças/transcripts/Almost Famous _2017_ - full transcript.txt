Almost Famous ﻿Script Chen Kleiman-Gal ﻿Based on the series of books "Almost Famous" by Michal Bachar ﻿Director Marco Carmel ﻿"Omri's party of the year! Invitations only. RSVP..." ﻿I'll be there. ﻿Damn.. ﻿Maybe there's no reception? ﻿Omri! -Hey, sweetie. ﻿What's up? Everything's ready? -Trust me. -Talk to you later. ﻿Reception problems? ﻿Wish you could be there, it's going to be the party of the year. ﻿Dana's parents agreed to a private performance by... ﻿Omer Adam! ﻿Try "Restart". ﻿Since when do you like Omer Adam? ﻿Come on, don't get all insulted. ﻿You're going to genius school anyhow, right? ﻿I'm the one stuck here. ﻿I won't miss anything about this obnoxious school. ﻿You will miss one thing. ﻿Yeah... ﻿Omri? ﻿The minute you're gone, I'm unfriending you. ﻿Maybe now? ﻿"Of course I'm invited to the party!" ﻿Shir's not with you? I was sure I saw her. ﻿No, no, she's... ﻿She went home. She's home. ﻿That's OK. -Yeah... ﻿We'll be right back. -Make it quick. ﻿Are you parked here, or what? ﻿Do you realize they actually thought we'd invite them to the party? ﻿They can think what they want. Omri said I'm in charge of the list ﻿and I say no pathetic geeks with lousy hair. -Exactly. ﻿All I need is them in my living room with the bad excuse for the clothes they wear. ﻿Did you see what she wore today? ﻿Some people cannot be helped. -Sad... ﻿Did you convince your parents about Omer Adam? ﻿No, they insist I get higher grades first. ﻿Like it's important to know math... ﻿Who is it? ﻿Who is it? ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿Had to pee. ﻿Sorry you had to hear that. ﻿If it were up to me, I'd invite you. ﻿I thought Omri said you decide. ﻿Yeah, but there are rules. Can't invite everyone. ﻿You need to be more... ﻿What does your father do? ﻿Yoga instructor. ﻿Sorry... ﻿I can help you get your grades up in math, if you want. ﻿For Omer Adam. ﻿I can help you. Teach you. ﻿You don't say... ﻿If you invite me and... -Get the exam first. ﻿What? ﻿The teacher loves you, right? ﻿Get the exam, I'll get you an invitation. ﻿Hi. ﻿Hey. ﻿Dad made a tofu mix, if you want some. ﻿I saw Roni today. Where were you? ﻿I'm not with her all the time, you know. -What? ﻿We're not together all the time. -Oh. ﻿Did you write the essay for gifted school already? ﻿What? No. ﻿What are you waiting for? I thought you wanted to transfer. ﻿Registration's over soon. -I want to but I didn't know what to write. ﻿Thought maybe you'd help me and we'll write it together. -Hold on. ﻿Hello. ﻿Yeah. Can't hear you. ﻿That's right... yeah. ﻿I see, I see, but... ﻿"Math exam" ﻿If your son would listen in class, things would be different. ﻿How about we go buy tickets tomorrow? ﻿Tomorrow? ﻿Come on, Tomer, we've been planning this trip for 2 years. ﻿Let's buy the tickets and get out of here already. ﻿I thought you don't have enough money yet. ﻿I saved up enough. ﻿I really feel like it already. ﻿Just you and me and big India. ﻿So tomorrow? ﻿Tomorrow, tomorrow, there's always tomorrow... ﻿Can't you see I'm reading? -That's OK, you don't have to thank me. ﻿For what exactly? -For curing you from chronic geekiness. ﻿Ok... go watch in your room. ﻿You go be a geek in your room. Go. ﻿"The One". PM. Here we go! ﻿Since when do you watch this show anyway? ﻿I want to see what everyone's talking about. ﻿Shir, what are you doing? ﻿See you at 9 PM on "The One". ﻿Shir. ﻿What's up there? ﻿Oops... -Ouch. ﻿Stop, stop. -Stop it. Enough... ﻿Stop, stop. ﻿Give me that. ﻿Tomer, stop. -Stop, stop, stop. -Hey, why fight? Why must you yell? ﻿Things can be resolved peacefully. Besides, it's not TV time now. ﻿Shir, call Mom. Tomer, mattresses. ﻿Now? Hmmm.. ﻿Inhale, Om... ﻿In, Om... ﻿Tomer! ﻿Tomer, come on. It's Daddy's time now. ﻿Today I'm leaving, where to, I do not know... ﻿What? You went to the selections? Did you pass? ﻿Why didn't you tell us anything? ﻿Surprise. ﻿Even Maya didn't know. ﻿But did you pass? -Did you pass or not? ﻿Are you going to participate in this show? ﻿If I passed, yeah. ﻿A short commercial break and then, ﻿who did our judges like? ﻿Tomer, I'm not kidding. ﻿Avner... -Just a sec. ﻿You're going to TV... there are consequences. ﻿I'm not sure I approve of all that vacuous glamour. ﻿So good to know you're supportive. ﻿Of course we support you. ﻿You know, I sung too when I was your age. ﻿I just thought you'd be happy I passed, that's all. ﻿Thanks for coming back to us. ﻿And now, Tomer Carmi's audition. ﻿Let's sit on some beach ﻿Live simply, simply live ﻿Hang out without worrying ﻿What's next, what's next ﻿Let me do you good ﻿Caress you till my hand's numb ﻿Waiting till you fall asleep ﻿Only to see you dream ﻿Maya, let's go away from here, sit together, be together ﻿And I'll turn on your light ﻿To turn off your fear... ﻿Yeah, did you see? What a surprise. No, I didn't know. ﻿Maya, let's go away from here, sit together, be together ﻿And I'll turn on your light ﻿To turn off your fear... ﻿If he makes it to the team, you're getting me an interview. ﻿With Tomer? -Yeah, he'll be a celeb. ﻿It'll be my first scoop. ﻿If I want to be a journalist, I need to start early. ﻿Can't waste time. Got to make it quick. ﻿Hey, bookworm... -Wait, I saw your brother on TV. ﻿Yeah, tell him he's hot. -Yeah, not ugly like you. ﻿Tomer's sister. ﻿Omri, are you coming? -Yeah. ﻿See you at the party? -Yeah, maybe. ﻿Did you see him talking to me? -I saw you talk to Dana... ﻿What did she mean? -What? ﻿She knows we're not coming, she's the one who didn't invite us. ﻿Then why did she say maybe she'll see you there? ﻿Did you tell her something? ﻿OK, I'll ask her myself. -She didn't tell me anything. ﻿You promised her something, I can tell. ﻿She just asked, I didn't promise to do it. ﻿I knew it. ﻿OK, what was it? ﻿A math exam. From my mom. ﻿No way... ﻿I didn't agree. -Of course not, she has some nerve... ﻿But if you want to, I'll do it. -What? ﻿Why would I want that? ﻿Because it's the most important party of the year. ﻿I'm probably leaving next year but you'll stay here, and without me. ﻿If we go, it's a chance for them to get to know you. ﻿They'll understand that the only reason we're not popular is that... ﻿they don't know us. ﻿What are you talking about? You want to steal an exam from your mom? ﻿And for Dana "Look, my nail polish matches my history notebook?" ﻿Not for her, for you. -Really? ﻿It's a chance to show them you're cool. -Geez, thanks... ﻿Fine, I won't if you don't want to. ﻿I won't give them the exam, we won't go to the party. ﻿I swear. ﻿OK. ﻿I have only one thing ﻿To say to you from all my heart ﻿You're the best thing in the world... ﻿Guys, 7 seasons... I've done 7 seasons ﻿and it was all worth it for this moment. ﻿You, alone, don't get me wrong, ﻿you're stunning. And you're fantastic too. ﻿But together, together, it's... you guys are a volcano... ﻿Never seen anything like it. ﻿You're real talented. I felt I was singing better. Really. ﻿Thanks, same here. -That's great, comradeship, hold on... ﻿I have original songs if you want to hearthem. -Just a sec. Hello? ﻿The song your wrote for the audition was beautiful. -Just a sec. ﻿I'll listen. Promise. That was so good, so good... ﻿I'm going to team you two up. ﻿You're going to the finals with me, for sure. It's a shame that only one can win ﻿but it's amazing, amazing. I'll be right back. Continue. Yes... ﻿What... what are you doing? -What? ﻿He told you we're going to the finals. ﻿Want to ruin it with songs that nobody knows? ﻿They're good. I can play them for you. -Not interested. ﻿I'm here to win. -OK, like all of us. ﻿Not if you think you'll sing your shower songs ﻿and someone will vote for you... ﻿This show is no game. ﻿It's my career, it's the most important thing in my life. ﻿And as long as we're teamed together, ﻿it's the most important thing in your life too, OK? ﻿OK. ﻿I had to sign that I'm staying in the country till the end of the show. ﻿But the second it's over, Mayu, ﻿Himachal Pradesh... ﻿Just you and me. ﻿Maya, India will wait a bit. ﻿They say it's the most beautiful view in the world. ﻿You know that's a lie. ﻿What? ﻿Because the most beautiful view in the world... is in front of me, right now. ﻿To turn off your fear... ﻿What? ﻿Wow. ﻿Maya, let's go away from here ﻿Sit together, be together ﻿And I'll turn on your light... ﻿"The reason I should get accepted to Marom School ﻿"is that I'm smart". "I'm a nerd". "I'm not popular in my school". ﻿"A new friend request from Omri". ﻿"Don't forget! Hottest party ever! Whoever's invited gotta make it!!!" ﻿"Shir, will I see you at the party?" ﻿"Of course!" ﻿"Finalize the invitation with Dana". ﻿Boo... ﻿What's that? -An exam. ﻿Materials for the exam. -Study hard. Get a high grade. ﻿Yeah, right... ﻿I'm not up to studying all day. She's the one who'll amount to something. ﻿Cool, then I don't need to go to a reality to amount to something... ﻿Come on, Shir, lighten up. ﻿Shir? ﻿Tonight at "The One". ﻿A peek behind the scenes. ﻿She's nice. ﻿Are you going to sing with her? All the time? Together? ﻿Trying to get out of me if I'm on the team or not? ﻿Listen, I know you're against it. ﻿It's not like I don't see what you're talking about. It's not purely music. ﻿They already told me to dress different, less casual. ﻿Told me to cut my hair too but I won't. ﻿Maybe something will come out of it. ﻿Think I'll let them change me? I'm perfect as I am. ﻿What about India? -We'll go after the shoot's over, I talked to Maya. ﻿Dad, I'm taking it in proportions. ﻿At first I thought I won't pass but now I think I want it. ﻿I have an opportunity to sing, maybe even my own songs so... India will wait. ﻿Maybe... Maybe it's bigger than India. -Oh, come on... ﻿Why say "Come on?" Dad, maybe this is my spiritual journey. ﻿Finally I have a chance to be real good at something I really love, Dad. ﻿I promise I'll be careful. I won't let them take me for a ride. ﻿But I need to know you're behind me. ﻿So will you come? -Sure we'll come. ﻿Dad? ﻿Of course well come. ﻿Wait, are we going to the studio? ﻿You passed? We're going? ﻿I'm not supposed to tell you this, ﻿but you're going to have to text vote for me. -No way! ﻿Yes! That's my son, it's in his genes. ﻿Shir, can I count on you to text for me? ﻿Well... if you take Roni and me to the studio then... ﻿Enough with the studio! Is that what you care about? ﻿"What's going on?" ﻿"I'm not allowed to say if my brother got into the team, ﻿"but we're interviewed on TV tomorrow. Enough said." ﻿"Your brother's cool". ﻿"I'm texting your gorgeous brother". -"Tomer is so cute". ﻿"Love you!" -"Tomer, call me!!!" ﻿Let's get started. ﻿I hope you prepared a personal heart-wrenching story. ﻿Were we supposed to? ﻿Want to win? ﻿Actually, we're a pretty ordinary family. Not much to say. We like doing yoga. We make sure to practice every day. ﻿We even have a little ritual each evening, we go: ﻿Om... -Om. -Om. ﻿I wanted to ask about that, ﻿it says here you were in banking. How did you get to yoga? ﻿Excuse me, what do you mean: "It says here"? No, I want to stop this. ﻿Avner... -What do you mean: "It says here"? ﻿No, Talia... what is this? ﻿What is this? -I thought we were going to talk about Tomer? ﻿We want to get to know the family and it's... a big change... ﻿from a senior bank manager to a yoga instructor. ﻿Our viewers want to know what happened exactly. ﻿That is, your side of the story. ﻿My side of the story? Let me tell you what my side is. ﻿My side thinks it's none of your business. ﻿OK, Avner. -That's what my side thinks. ﻿Sorry, it was years ago. ﻿Shir, why don't you tell us something about yourself. ﻿Me? ﻿Do you sing too? You got the right name. ﻿Umm... -Shir's an outstanding student, she doesn't have time for these things. ﻿But she can do the grasshopper pose. ﻿Shir, do you want to show them the grasshopper? The pose? ﻿Umm... my mom sings. ﻿Yeah, she released a sing once. She has a disc too. ﻿A tape, in my days it was called a tape... ﻿why don't you sing f0r us? ﻿We'd love to hear where Tomer's talent came from. ﻿OK, sing. ﻿Umm.. ﻿Forthose who don't believe ﻿It's hard to live this year... ﻿And we're moving on... ﻿let's meet Rotem's family. ﻿My parents always supported me. ﻿We always lived a simple life but we never lacked anything. ﻿If there was something missing, it was stuffed with love and of course... ﻿with Morn's stuffed vegetables. ﻿Bless her! She's my biggest success. Wow, wow, wow. Some family. Some food. ﻿Ladies and gentlemen, welcome... Rotem. ﻿So Rotem, it's your first time on live broadcast. ﻿Nervous? -Very much. ﻿Let's tell the audience at home ﻿that you're going to sing tonight with Tomer Carmi. ﻿So a moment before he goes on stage, ﻿let's see what's going on in Tomer's house. ﻿OK, let's start. ﻿I hope you prepared a personal heart-wrenching story. ﻿Were we supposed to? ﻿We like doing yoga... We make sure to practice every day. ﻿We even have a little ritual each evening, we go: Om... -Om... ﻿Don't worry, they won't broadcast it, I sang. ﻿Shir, why don't you tell us something about yourself. ﻿Me? ﻿Shir doesn't have time for those things, she's an outstanding student. ﻿Three minutes, Tomer and Rotem to the stage, please. ﻿Is the stage ready? -Yes, let them -Turn on the lights. ﻿What are you doing here? Do you have a badge? ﻿Oh, I'm... I'm waiting for Tomer. ﻿OK, fans wait outside. ﻿Who let her in? -It's OK, she's with me. ﻿OK, five minutes. -Cool. ﻿So? What do you think? ﻿Nice? -I don't know... ﻿It's... it's a bit different. ﻿But is it good? ﻿I'd hug you but I don't want to mess up your style. ﻿Yes, I feel like I'm in a costume, I'm all sweaty too. ﻿Lucky you're here, Mayu. ﻿You'll be amazing, I'm sure. ﻿What are you doing here? They cued you. ﻿Eladi, meet Maya, my girlfriend. ﻿You're crazy, we got to go up. ﻿Hi, I'm Rotem, we're singing together. ﻿I saw on TV. ﻿I wrote the song about her, you know. -Really? That's nice. ﻿Take her to the studio downstairs. ﻿Forthose who don't believe ﻿It's hard to live this year... ﻿Wow, what a family. ﻿No wonder Tomer's a singer with such a mother. ﻿Absolutely fabulous but... ﻿Will they go home happy or in tears? ﻿It's only up to them and up to what you think at home. ﻿So here they are in a first duet, ﻿Tomer and Rotem, good luck. ﻿In a little neighborhood ﻿On a blue bed ﻿You say... ﻿It'll be OK ﻿If we only ﻿Give it sometime ﻿Look at me ﻿Smile at me ﻿You know ﻿How good it makes me feel ﻿When you lay by my side ﻿There's only one thing I have ﻿To say to you ﻿From all my heart ﻿You're the best thing in the world ﻿I love you so much ﻿Sometimes it hurts ﻿I let go of everything ﻿The anger, the sadness, the lies ﻿When you're with me... ﻿"20 new requests" ﻿Holding my hand ﻿And saying ﻿that you love me ﻿"Awesome duet! Tomer's stunning!" ﻿Even if I can't ﻿Do everything ﻿I promise ﻿I can ﻿I promise ﻿To be yours ﻿Always ﻿My sweetheart ﻿Time will stop... ﻿And we'll escape ﻿"Your brother's a star" ﻿from here deep into paradise ﻿Me and you ﻿Alone ﻿There's only one thing I have ﻿To say to you from all my heart ﻿You're the best thing in the world ﻿I love you so much ﻿Sometimes it hurts ﻿let to go of everything ﻿The anger, the sadness, the lies ﻿When you're with me ﻿Holding my hand ﻿And saying that ﻿You love me... ﻿Delightful, huh? What do you say, judges? ﻿We never heard a song like that. ﻿Wow, wow, I'm speechless, it's... I'm speechless. ﻿I got to say you just killed me ﻿and that's what I'm here for. ﻿Have you met Elad? ﻿Can I take a picture with Tomer? ﻿Excuse me, what's going on here? ﻿Didn't you hear the bell? Let's go! ﻿Shir... -We didn't know you're a singer, "teach". ﻿Not now, let's go. Before I'm marking you "late". ﻿Get into class. -Can I...? ﻿Wait, if we vote for him, you won't mark us late? ﻿Backpacks, sleeping bags hydration bladders, ﻿hiking shoes, hiking socks. ﻿Oh, a camera. ﻿OK, we'll buy one as soon as shooting's over. -OK. ﻿Oh, don't look for a sec... ﻿That's Hemi Rudner over there. ﻿What a king. A genius. ﻿Embarrassing, I looked right at him. ﻿Probably used to people staring at him like jerks. -Hey... -OK, hush... ﻿Yo! ﻿Man, it's you, huh? ﻿What? ﻿You're from... -Oh, yeah. Tomer. ﻿Tomer, nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. ﻿I saw you last night, gave a hell of a performance. ﻿I'm shocked that you saw it. ﻿Do a song of mine some time. ﻿Sure, why not? ﻿Who's in charge? Shachar? -Yeah. ﻿What an asshole. Tell him to throw us a bone. ﻿What? Only Shiomi's allowed to? ﻿Excuse me, can we take a picture? ﻿Listen, I'm crazy about you. ﻿Can you take a picture of us? ﻿Sure. -Thanks. ﻿Thanks. -Glad to. ﻿Good luck. -Thank you very much. ﻿Man... -Don't you want to hear? ﻿Because if you don't want to hear ﻿about the most sensational scoop... -Hi... ﻿Hold on, I can't be a snob. ﻿You're annoying since you became a celeb. ﻿They expect something of me. ﻿You'll see how it feels when you come with me. ﻿Yeah, sure. ﻿Because everyone will want to be friends with the friend of the sister ﻿of the one who wants to be famous. -He's already famous. ﻿It's got nothing to do with Tomer either. -No, not at all... ﻿Really, it's got nothing to do with him. It's because they know me now. ﻿They know you? -Yeah. ﻿They want to be my friends. ﻿Who? ﻿Know what? I'll prove it to you. I'm going to get an invitation for the party. ﻿Hi. ﻿You can forget it. ﻿Forget what? ﻿About the exam. ﻿Oh... ﻿It was a joke. Think we were going to cheat on the exam? ﻿Don't you get a joke? ﻿What? ﻿Wait... ﻿Maybe she can bring her brother? ﻿My parents didn't agree to Omer Adam. ﻿If you get your brother to sing... ﻿You can come. ﻿Of course I can get him to sing. ﻿Awesome. -Awesome. ﻿Can Roni also... ﻿Well, are we going to the party? ﻿Of course. ﻿Told you they just need to get to know us. ﻿OK, you want to hear the scoop now? ﻿What is it? ﻿Rumor has it... that Omri broke up with Dana. ﻿Are you for real? How could you not tell me? ﻿Come on. ﻿Hey, honey. ﻿So good to see you, I didn't know you were coming today. ﻿Yeah, I'm waiting for Tomer. -Oh... -We're supposed to buy gear for the trip. ﻿Oh... -We'll only go once he's kicked off the show. ﻿Kicked off? ﻿I don't think he'll be kicked off so soon, I have a hunch he's with us till the end. ﻿Know what? ﻿There's a way you can help him do that. ﻿Keep on texting... -Not only that. ﻿Keep a low profile. ﻿It's not personal, right? ﻿Bu the fact that you're his girlfriend isn't helpful for him. ﻿Not helpful in what way? ﻿There are lots of girls in the audience and they like to picture him as a single guy. ﻿That's OK, I'm not interested in publicity. ﻿I know, that's why I knew I could talk to you, ﻿you're a smart kid and that's very cool... ﻿I'll explain, OK? At this stage, we're creating his image. ﻿He's good looking and charming, ﻿but that's good for the first part of the show. ﻿Then we'll have to... ﻿I'm talking here! Thank you. ﻿Then we'll have to... you know, build it. ﻿Build some tension, maybe well give him... ﻿romance. ﻿With me? You want me and him... ﻿Not at all, not with you. ﻿With Rotem. ﻿They're a famous couple, it'll be powerful but it's all... ﻿an illusion, right? You understand it's an act. ﻿If you want, I'll watch him with a stick... ﻿to keep him from doing anything. What do you think? ﻿I'm not worried, it's OK. -Wow, you're amazing, an angel! ﻿I knew I could talk to you. ﻿You see? It's a game. We can't let reality ﻿ruin our illusion. ﻿Alright? OK. ﻿You see, ﻿this whole thing... seriously? ﻿It can change his life and yours too. ﻿OK, friends, we have 10 minutes. ﻿She doesn't look ﻿Like anyone else ﻿Like any other girl walking down the street ﻿She is strange ﻿And when she talks ﻿Her voice makes me feel close... ﻿Honey, don't take your eyes off of me ﻿Cause if you only blink, you'll be replaced by two ﻿I'm the queen here, no point in arguing ﻿Clap your hands, let's shake it up ﻿I'm running the show, taking it to the extreme ﻿I'm gonna take the world by storm ﻿So baby, don't forget you're going to fly high ﻿And if you can't take it, I'll say goodbye... ﻿She doesn't look ﻿Like anyone else ﻿Like any other girl walking down the street... ﻿Clap your hands, let's shake it up... ﻿She is strange ﻿And when she talks ﻿Her voice makes me feel close... ﻿I'm the queen here, no point in arguing... ﻿She doesn't look... -Honey, don't take your eyes off of me ﻿Like anyone else... -Cause if you only blink, you'll be replaced by two... ﻿Like any other girl... -I'm the queen here, no point in arguing... ﻿Walking down the street -Clap your hands, let's shake it up ﻿She is strange... -Running the show, taking it to the extreme ﻿And when she talks... - I'm gonna take the world by storm... ﻿Her voice makes me feel close... -So baby, don't forget you're going to fly high ﻿Makes me feel close... -And if you can't take it, I'll say goodbye... ﻿She doesn't look... ﻿Like anyone else... ﻿Like any other girl walking down the street ﻿She is strange ﻿And when she talks ﻿Her voice makes me feel close... ﻿OK, good.

They sent him from the show. ﻿The mall... ﻿The mall, totally. ﻿Oh... it's that way. ﻿I missed you. ﻿Come on, Maya. ﻿You said none if this stuff annoys you, that you don't care. ﻿I missed you, it's not the same, seeing you on TV. ﻿I'm sorry, sweetie. ﻿OK? ﻿Looking for a scoop? ﻿Huh? ﻿You piece of... ﻿Tomer, stop! Tomer, stop. Leave him alone. ﻿Tomer, stop. Leave him alone. Stop! -Get out of the way... ﻿Lunatic. ﻿You won't believe the crazy messages I get. ﻿People send lyrics and ask him to write the music. ﻿Some guy offered that we buy text messages. ﻿Like a bundle? ﻿Messages for the show, for Tomer. ﻿10,000 shekels for 200,000 text messages. ﻿Really? I didn't know you could do that. ﻿Me neither. -What will you answer? -Who's answering? ﻿Let the other competitors waste their money. ﻿Roni, bye. ﻿How did it go? Tell me on the way. ﻿Not now, Shir. -Not now? We're late. ﻿Where to? ﻿To the party. You said you'd come. ﻿Tomer... You promised. ﻿Don't do this to me. They're all waiting for you there. ﻿Umm.. ﻿OK, OK... maybe I'll come later. ﻿Not maybe. Come. ﻿Alright. ﻿Yeah? ﻿Didn't you say they broke up? ﻿Maybe he's dumping her now. ﻿What's she doing here? ﻿Excuse me? ﻿I told her it's OK. -Well, it's not OK at all. ﻿We told you to bring your brother, not what's-her-name. ﻿Where's Tomer? -She brought her instead. ﻿On his way, he'll be here soon. ﻿And Roni won't get in the way. ﻿Of course not, because I'm going. -Good! You weren't invited. ﻿Are you coming? -Hold on, Roni. ﻿Let her go, she's not invited anyway. ﻿Fine, who wants to be here anyhow. ﻿Oh no, Roni the geek doesn't want to hang with us? ﻿Don't call her that. -Why are you even trying? ﻿Don't worry, they didn't invite you because you're their friend, ﻿they wanted to see Tomer. ﻿You're so pathetic. ﻿We invited Shir because she's cool. You weren't invited because you're not. ﻿Deal with it! ﻿Are you staying or leaving? ﻿Yeah, Shir... ﻿Are you staying? ﻿Roni, come on, wait a sec. ﻿It's better that's she's gone. -Come on, she's out of your league. ﻿You're Tomer Carmi's sister, better act accordingly. ﻿It's time to move on. ﻿So when's Tomer coming? ﻿Soon. ﻿Where's Tomer? ﻿On his way. He'll be here soon. He just had lots of rehearsals today. ﻿He's on his way. ﻿"Tomer, where are you? Get over here already" ﻿Hey, what's up? Where's Tomer? ﻿On his way. He'll be here soon. ﻿On his way. He'll be here soon! ﻿Who?' ﻿Tomer... I thought you wanted... ﻿No, I just came to grab a coke. ﻿Hey. -Hi. ﻿Have you seen my credit card? ﻿No. ﻿Tomer! Tomer! ﻿You can throw that out. -Tomer! Did you hit him? ﻿What? -Did you hit the photographer? ﻿How do you know? ﻿I can't believe it. People make an effort for you. ﻿Do you know how much money we invested? How much time? And what do you do? ﻿I'm sorry, Mom, I don't know how he tracked me down. ﻿Man, Maya will kill me. ﻿Maya? Is that what worries you now? Maya? ﻿You know how much damage this does? And today's the semi-fmals!: ﻿I need to call Maya. -Maya will wait. ﻿Let's think how we handle this first, OK? ﻿We need to make a press release. ﻿I'll set up an interview Jat the Guy Pines show. ﻿Mom, I need to talk to Maya! ﻿Hush! ﻿There are people texting for you in the living room. ﻿Mom, give me the phone. Maya? ﻿It's Pnai Plus magazine. They want a response. ﻿Hello. Yeah. ﻿Yes, this is... Tomer's Mom. ﻿Sure. Sure. ﻿Sure. No problem. ﻿Listen.. ﻿I'm sorry Tomer didn't show up yesterday. ﻿That's totally understandable. ﻿Probably had a hard day. ﻿They get it all twisted in the media, ﻿they can't stand the fact that someone succeeds in this country. ﻿I remember the first time they wrote about my father. ﻿The employees committee in his factory wanted better conditions ﻿and they turned him into a monster. They should have thanked him. ﻿What? ﻿They always hate success stories. It's a curse. ﻿What, they wrote something about Tomer? ﻿Didn't you see? They wrote about your dad. ﻿I didn't know he was fired because he had a nervous breakdown. ﻿I wish you would've said something. My mom has a real good doctor. ﻿"It's all in the genes. Dad had a nervous breakdown. His son attacked a photographer". ﻿Is that why your brother beat up that photographer? ﻿Are you OK? ﻿She's fine. ﻿What do you want? -To talk to my friend. May I? ﻿That's so predictable, Roni. ﻿Think because they wrote some nasty things about her father, ﻿she'll be your friend again? ﻿Shir, moved on in life, Roni. Deal with it. ﻿Shir? ﻿It's fine, Roni. ﻿Yeah, right. -It's fine. ﻿They always find a reason to put successful people down. ﻿Only... ﻿only losers take it to heart. ﻿Avner, is it true you were fired? Avner? ﻿Dad, Maya... help her. ﻿Let him go, learn to let go. ﻿It's pathetic, Maya. ﻿Stop keeping him away from Rotem. ﻿You're disgusting. Enough. ﻿Tonight, the semi-finals. ﻿Fates will be decided. ﻿The first performance tonight comes from the pop world. ﻿Please welcome... ﻿Rotem! ﻿I diss everyone and do everything myself ﻿Cause I'm already here to get my share ﻿Everyone keeps their distance from me ﻿Cause they call me the scorcher ﻿I devour ﻿You're losing out now, I'm the only one with class ﻿Rotem's in the neighborhood to put on a circus ﻿You can be sure nothing's undecided ﻿This run around I'm taking the prize ﻿Today everybody knows who I am ﻿You'll end up realizing it's all for real... ﻿God bless you. Knock on wood. ﻿Mirror, mirror on the wall ﻿Loves me most ﻿And who's the prettiest in town? ﻿Looking at me ﻿Start dancing, they've figured out the secret ﻿They always do it quietly ﻿Their eyes are always on me, sun's above me too ﻿They call me the scorcher ﻿Almost famous... ﻿We're going on stage in two minutes. Get Tomer for me. ﻿OK, Elad, well be on stage in a minute. ﻿Make it quick. ﻿I'm so glad to see you. ﻿Tomer, you need to go on stage. ﻿In a sec. ﻿What's wrong? ﻿Nothing. ﻿Nothing? I can see something's up. ﻿Everybody thinks you're cheating on Rotem with me ﻿and you're going for it so I don't want to get in the way. ﻿OK, I'll take care of it. ﻿OK? I don't know... I'll say it on the show. ﻿Do you think more publicity will help? ﻿It was your choice to go on the show, ~ not mine. ﻿You didn't even tell me, before you went to the audition. ﻿I wanted to surprise you. ﻿I wanted to sing for you. ﻿Tomer, we need to go on stage. -Shut up! ﻿I know... ﻿And I tried. I really tired. ﻿When you had to act like you're in love with someone else, I played along. ﻿I even agreed to stay clear when Elad told me it wouldn't be good for you ﻿if they'd know we're together... -He told you what? What? ﻿Why didn't you tell me? ﻿45 seconds to go on stage. Why isn't Tomer here? ﻿Tomer, we need to go up there. -Shut up! ﻿He yelled at me, the little shit. ﻿Why didn't you tell me? -How would that help exactly? ﻿You did whatever they told you the whole time. ﻿I didn't have a choice. ﻿You know I didn't want to. ﻿But you did. ﻿And that's the situation. ﻿make it right. ﻿I'm queen of the party ﻿But why almost? ﻿You said I was famous... ﻿Bravo! ﻿Thanks, Rotem, a great performance. ﻿Good evening... ﻿I'm taking an earlier flight. -What? ﻿You're leaving me now? ﻿Elad's on stage. Get him up there now! ﻿Tomer, we got to get on stage now. Maya... ﻿I'm sorry... ﻿So... We had such a crazy week. ﻿At the request of the family, we won't discuss what happened this week. ﻿No need to recall unpleasant things that happened. ﻿We want... ﻿Ultimately, to say... ﻿There he is. ﻿Almost thought you changed your mind. ﻿OK... ﻿How are you feeling? Confident? ﻿I'm... only here to sing. ﻿Go ahead, Tomer. ﻿Tell me how to stop the tears... ﻿Good luck to your brother ﻿Tell me where there is another world to live in ﻿Tell me why there is no truth, only illusions... ﻿"If he passes, will you come to the finals?" ﻿"Love to. Hope he makes it" ﻿Along the seashore ﻿There are no waves, only a world ﻿Shattered to pieces ﻿On the dock ﻿Along the seashore ﻿There are no waves, only a world... ﻿Stop, stop, hush, stop... ﻿Stop barking. ﻿On the deck... ﻿OK, please everybody... Hold on. ﻿Let's calm down, ﻿it happens to the very best. ﻿Let's hear what our judges have to say ﻿about Tomer's performance tonight. ﻿Look... it was... ﻿It was not good. ﻿I want to remind you two he was your favorite. ﻿That's true but I'm with Korin on this. ﻿At this stage of the competition, there's no mercy. ﻿I just... I just want to tell you, sweetheart, ﻿that if it were up to me... -Wait, would you vote for him? ﻿Would you? ﻿Not me. -There you go... -Sorry. ﻿Would you tell me what's going on with you? ﻿How do you plan to win this way? -Honey, it's not the right time. ﻿Sorry, it's not like I wanted to sing out of tune on live broadcast. ﻿OK, let's all breathe for a moment. -Not now, Avner. ﻿You beat photographers, sing out of tune on-air, ﻿won't take pictures with people who come to our home to text for you. ﻿Don't think I didn't hear from Bruria that you refused to film a greeting ﻿for the Bat Mitzva of her niece, Shalhevet. -Come on... ﻿Know what I think, Tomer? ﻿I think you don't want to win. -I do. ﻿Because if you don't want to, you could have told us ﻿before we turned our lives around for you. ﻿Do you know what your father's going through? -I'm fine. ﻿I didn't ask you to. ﻿Excuse me? ﻿I didn't ask you to! ﻿I didn't ask you to vote for me. I didn't ask for the fliers, ﻿I didn't ask forthose lame "Tomer" shirts. ﻿I didn't even want to win, ﻿I just wanted to sing songs that I wrote for Maya. ﻿Just so you know, ﻿I sang out of tune because Maya left me. ﻿Tomer, Tomer, hold on a sec. ﻿Tomer, this conversation isn't over. -Leave him alone, Talia. ﻿Tell me, why don't you help your son? ﻿Maybe that's not the help he needs right now? ﻿Oh, so let's breathe. Maybe that'll help him win... ﻿Yeah, it can help him win himself back. ﻿Veah' maybe in Om world. ﻿In the real world, you need to play along to get ahead. ﻿Can we not do this in front of her? ﻿Shir's old enough to hear us fight. ﻿We're not fighting. ﻿"Who will be The One?" ﻿You'd rather have him quit ﻿so you're little secret will be forgotten, you egoist! ﻿Don't say that, you hear me? -Yeah... ﻿I let go of my ego for spiritual work. ﻿You let go of your job at the bank is what you did. ﻿A so called nervous breakdown... who became the provider at home, huh? ﻿I'd like to remind you it was a joint decision. ﻿I suffered there. -Oh, and I'm happy. Sure. ﻿Teaching the same material year after year is fun... -Excuse me! ﻿Year after year! -Excuse me! ﻿These negative energies are unacceptable. -Oh, go meditate! ﻿Enough, kiddo... ﻿Don't worry. ﻿It's not over. ﻿Well work harder, people love you, they'll text for you. ﻿There's still a chance you'll pass. ﻿OK? ﻿"Tomer, worst singer of the season" ﻿"His real face was revealed" ﻿"What a loser" ﻿"Roni" ﻿"Maya, please, please, please, call me" ﻿"Friends" ﻿"We're sorry, the application process was not completed. Application denied" ﻿"Come on, Maya, where are you?" ﻿"Maya, why aren't you answering me?" ﻿"Maya, I love you. ﻿Sorry, sorry, sorry. Please!" ﻿"Is the offer still valid?" ﻿"Bundle of 50,000 text messages for 10,000 shekels!" ﻿"Interested? Press 'ENTER'." May I? ﻿You didn't answer. ﻿What are you doing here? -I saw the show. ﻿And you came to gloat. -I came to see that you're alright. ﻿Why wouldn't I be alright? -OK, so you're alright. ﻿I'm not going back to being your friend. ﻿I've noticed. ﻿I'm sorry, we were good friends and all but I'm in a different place now. ﻿I get it. Just don't come crying later ﻿when Tomer's kicked off of the show and your new friends will disappear. ﻿Tomer won't be kicked off. ﻿After singing out of tune today? -He won't. ﻿People love him. ﻿I'm giving Dana and Yarden ﻿5 minutes after the elimination show to forget you exist. ﻿See? That's your problem. ﻿You whine all day about not being popular ﻿but you can't do anything to make it happen. ﻿I won't be disgusting, that's all. ﻿Do youthink they give a damn about you? ﻿Don't you get that they think you're out of their league? ﻿Maybe you think that way. Think I became popular by accident? ﻿I got them to get to know me and like me. ﻿I didn't sit around whining like you, waiting for a miracle. ﻿did something for my life. ﻿"To confirm the bundle press ENTER". ﻿What are you planning to do? -None of your business. ﻿Shir... -Roni, get out of here. ﻿You don't mean to... -Roni, get off my back! ﻿I told you to stay out of it. ﻿Sit and shut your mouth like you're used to ﻿or I'll bring all my friends and no one in school will ever talk to you. ﻿"Request approved" Wow, so much tension in the air. ﻿So exciting. What a crowd... ﻿The moment of truth in the semi-finals is almost here. Rotem... ﻿You're less nervous now ﻿because your place in the finals is secured. ﻿Question is... who'll join you? ﻿Nastia, Udi or Tomer? ﻿Tomer, in the previous show the judges... ﻿came down hard on you for singing out of tune. ﻿What do you think? Are you going home today? ﻿Everybody goes home at the end, right? ﻿That's true, but only one will go to the big finals. ﻿Want to know who it is? ﻿So come on... 10... ﻿9... 8... 7... ﻿3... 2... 1! ﻿I have the results. ﻿The winner in The One tonight... ﻿The person who continues... ﻿Ladies and gentlemen... ﻿Tomer Carmi! ﻿He said Tomer, right? ﻿Who would believe it?! ﻿Who would believe it?! Who thought such a turnover was possible? ﻿Apparently you folks at home really love Tomer. ﻿Tomer, we're so happy to have you with us. ﻿Here's the royal couple of the current season... ﻿Rotem and Tomer! ﻿Where did the money go to? ﻿Do you even know how much you spent? ﻿I admit, maybe it's more than I expected ﻿but it'll pay off, you'll see. A little more effort and... ﻿No! It's time to put an end to it. ﻿Before the finals? Think so? ﻿How are you going to cover the debts? ﻿Savings. ﻿You want to spend the money for their tuition? ﻿It's temporary, until Tomer's career will start paying it back. ﻿No, I don't agree to this. ﻿I'm not asking you. ﻿It's money I earned while you were doing yoga. ﻿You're not ruining it for Tomer. ﻿For Tomer or for you? ﻿You're so immersed in your dream that you don't even see the kid. ﻿When was the last time you saw him smile? ﻿When he made it to the finals. ﻿And you bought it? ﻿It's called reality, but that doesn't make it real. ﻿Oh, because truth lies within me? ﻿In your stupid silences? In Om? ﻿Want to hear the truth, Avner? Can you even handle the truth? ﻿No, you're crazy. I don't want to hear this. -I'm crazy? ﻿You're mediocre, Avner. ﻿Yes, you're mediocre. You wallow in mediocrity, and call it spirituality. ﻿Mediocre and scared, is what you are. ﻿I'll sleep in my studio. -Yeah, run away, you chicken. ﻿Think you're threatening someone? ﻿Don't you care about anything? ﻿I'm leaving home! You hear me? ﻿I dare you to. ﻿Tomer, did we wake you up, sweetheart? ﻿Go to sleep, Tomer. ﻿"The big finals" ﻿Thought you were avoiding chocolate till the finals. ﻿Clean up, you have some over here. ﻿You should talk... ﻿Look at yourself, you goofball... -Tomer! ﻿Stop! ﻿Remember this? ﻿You zombie... -So scary... ﻿Hi. ﻿Are your parents home? ﻿Fake text messages? Is there such a thing? ﻿I need to know now if you're involved. ﻿We have no idea what you're talking about. -Hmm... ﻿Where's Avner? ﻿Believe me, it's not him. It didn't come from our family. ﻿Hmm.. ﻿OK, alright. ﻿So what do we do? -We can't let you win. ﻿It's not his fault. You can't do that to him. ﻿He signed a contract that we can. ﻿Look at clause 6.3. ﻿No, no... that's not right. ﻿Listen, your son sang out of tune and he's in the finals. ﻿That's not fair, That's not right. ﻿OK, hold on. I got it, I got it. ﻿I know what we'll do. I got it. ﻿We continue the show as usual. You go up and sing, OK? ﻿At the end of the show before the announcement, Boom! ﻿You quit, Rotem wins. ﻿The media will love it. It's a romantic gesture... -Excuse me? ﻿If you're lucky, it'll turn out better than winning the show. ﻿So I'm quitting now. ﻿No, no, you can't do that to us contract-wise. ﻿You're forcing me to sing? ﻿Listen, we'd rather not tell anyone about this fraud, ﻿but if you're forcing us too, fine. ﻿Well play along and tell everyone. ﻿And then we'll go to court and waste money and it'll get nasty, ﻿and the whole family will look even worse on the media, ﻿you'll hit another paparazzi guy and your dad will lose it again. ﻿No problem. Cool. -OK, OK... ﻿We get it. ﻿Tomer, sweetie, listen, if we quit in the finals, ﻿we still have a chance to develop your career. ﻿It's the best solution for everyone, OK? ﻿If no one will know, there's nothing to worry about. ﻿Thanks for coming. ﻿Yeah... ﻿Thanks. ﻿The producers intervened, huh? ﻿What? ﻿They decide at the end, all these text messages are bullshit. ﻿That's not true. ﻿Then how did Tomer make it to the finals if he sang out of tune? ﻿They helped him the whole time, right? I bet nobody ever texted for him. ﻿Tons of people did. ﻿Tomer's in the finals because he's talented and people love him. ﻿And he'll win. ﻿Yeah, Omri and I, we'll go to the finals together. ﻿You and Omri? -Yeah. ﻿Of course... ﻿Yeah, we already made plans. ﻿Get it? ﻿They agreed to be her friends only to get close to Tomer. ﻿Dana wanted to take a picture with him to make Omri jealous. ﻿How did Shir not notice? -And it worked too. ﻿Yarden showed Omri Dana's picture with Tomer ﻿and he got back together with her in the season opening party. ﻿That nerd thought she stood a chance. ﻿Yeah... ﻿Know what? I don't know why I was her friend in the first place. ﻿Did you know she wanted to transfer to a new school cause she didn't have friends? ﻿Did you tell her all the secrets you know about me or do you need another moment? ﻿Some friend you are. ﻿Look who's talking. ﻿Oh, you can stoop down to talk to me now? ﻿: Don't forget I know things about you too. ﻿You don't see me telling the whole world about your parents' divorce, right? ﻿Did you tell her? ﻿That your mom sent you off to live with your dad and his new girlfriend? ﻿No. ﻿But maybe I'll tell her about the message you got about Tomer. ﻿What... What message? -Ask her. ﻿What did you do to have Tomer win? Huh, Shir? ﻿It's not true. ﻿Shir, are you alright? ﻿What's wrong? ﻿Mom... -What, sweetie? What's wrong? ﻿What's wrong? ﻿What, sweetie? What's wrong? ﻿You know it's not us who faked the results, right? ﻿Hmm...? ﻿What's wrong? ﻿I took your credit card... ﻿to buy a dress for the party... ﻿and shoes. ﻿OK... ﻿I didn't expect that from you. ﻿Well... ﻿You'll have to find a way to return the money... ﻿OK? ﻿Hi, you've reached me. Nameste. ﻿I'm sorry. It's not your fault ﻿So... ﻿What will you do? -Whatever they want. ﻿It doesn't matter anyhow. Maya got an earlier flight for tomorrow. ﻿I'm sorry, Tomer. ﻿"Roni" ﻿"Look what I designed especially for you" ﻿"Tomer Carmi's sister bought fake text messages for him!" ﻿"Transfer picture." ﻿"Distribution list." ﻿"Tomer Carmi's sister bought fake text messages for him!" ﻿So the production didn't interfere. ﻿Did you buy Tomer all the votes or did he win some himself? ﻿You're such a lowlife. As if Omri would go out with a fraud like you. ﻿By the way, it wasn't Omri you chatted with on Facebook. ﻿What? ﻿I've been running his page for a year. ﻿Honey, you didn't really think he'd pay any attention to you, right? ﻿Not with that hair. -Not with that face. ﻿What's with you? ﻿Crazy about you. ﻿What do you want? I didn't send those messages. ﻿only sent them to you. -I know. ﻿What do you mean? ﻿I sent them. ﻿You sent them to everyone? ﻿Why? ﻿Because it's true. ﻿I bought those text messages. ﻿I was also nasty to you. ﻿I wanted to write that too, but... ﻿I needed you for the photoshop... ﻿What? ﻿I'm sorry, Roni. ﻿I got carried away. ﻿I wanted to be popular so much that I let myself do things... ﻿I don't want to be... ﻿the obnoxious fraud I became. ﻿You're not. ﻿Well, you are, a little. ﻿That's OK, it'll pass. ﻿Will you go back to being my friend? ﻿I don't think anyone else will now... ﻿There's Tomer's sister, come here, give us one picture... ﻿Shir, Shir! Get in the car. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿I don't know what I was thinking. ﻿Thanks for trying though. ﻿I heard! ﻿That's great! ﻿Even better than before. ﻿Wait, what's great? ﻿Your daughter is. Listen, your daughter is a genius. ﻿A little sister who wants to help her brother... Wow, you couldn't even make that up! ﻿Guys, we're doing good. ﻿Kids... ﻿Kids are forgiven anything. ﻿OK, well start off the show with you. ﻿Me? -Wait, what do you want her to do? ﻿I'll write something for her, a moving apology. Wait, know how to cry? ﻿On television, you mean? ﻿No, in the paper... It's real simple. ﻿You get into the frame... ﻿And you say... ﻿"My brother, I always loved him and I wanted to take care of him ﻿"and I was only trying to do something good". You see? ﻿Real simple. Don't worry. Nice! Excellent. ﻿And then we do another round with Rotem, ﻿it's authorized by the concessionaire. Great. Guys, we have a show. ﻿Just a sec. -What? -Hold on... ﻿Shir, are you willing to do it? -You don't have to. ﻿Are you delusional? She'll be a bigger star than you. ﻿Go, take her downstairs. Make-up, hair, clothes, the whole thing. ﻿Man, I wish I had such a sweet sister ﻿who would be willing to do stuff like that for me. ﻿Everyone will adore you. ﻿What do you say? -Think so? ﻿Hold on a second. ﻿Roni? ﻿What, Shir? ﻿They should have kicked you off the show. -You're right. ﻿I only agreed to this for the rating, just so you know. ﻿OK, guys, here's the line-up: we start with your sister, ﻿Rotem, you sing afterwards, as nice as you can, and then Tomer. ﻿We're doing the song from the auditions, OK? ﻿And we're doing it... ﻿The new, cool rendition... -Yes, I remember. ﻿Good. I need you to sing ﻿"Rotem" instead of "Maya", OK? Got almost the same rhythm. ﻿What do you mean, "Rotem"? -Don't give me a hard time. ﻿Ok... Get the sister, I want to rehearse with her. ﻿What do you mean, don't know where Shir is? ﻿She disappeared and I need to open the show with her! ﻿Tomer, where's Shir? Have you seen her? ﻿Listen to me, you'll find her, or you're apologizing on her behalf, get it? ﻿Alright, alright. -Find Shir. ﻿Roni! ﻿Where is she? ﻿She's here, been here for 5 minutes. ﻿Sorry, sorry. ﻿Platform 6, come on. ﻿Good evening! ﻿Welcome to the Big Finals of The One! ﻿One commercial ﻿and we're back with Tomer's moving confession. ﻿Turn the building upside down... ﻿Where is she? Found her? ﻿No, they don't know where she is. ﻿Why did you even bring her here? -Tell me, where were you? ﻿Where were you when everyone heard what she did? ﻿Who did she do it for? ﻿Roni... ﻿I'm guilty too. ﻿I acted like an idiot. ﻿You were always there for me and I... ﻿I didn't go along with your dream... ﻿I'm sorry. Maya! ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿You can't go. ﻿Shir, come on... -You can't. ﻿I understand you're trying to help. ﻿But there's no point. ﻿No, listen, you got to forgive him. ﻿He got lost, he... ﻿He became what everyone wanted him to be. ﻿He made a mistake. We all do. Me too. I was stupid. ﻿Shir, stop. ﻿Really, I did everything to become someone else, to be worthwhile, ﻿but to be really worthwhile, you just need to love yourself. ﻿Thanks for coming back to us. ﻿We'll start off tonight a bit differently. ﻿We're all aware of... the chain of events... ﻿that was a bit unpleasant for us all. ﻿The little sister who only wanted to lend a hand to her big brother. ﻿And she wanted to say a few words from her heart, ﻿but she's embarrassed to stand here. ﻿Do you love Tomer? ﻿You love him. ﻿You love him and he loves you. You can't give that up. ﻿You can't give him up. ﻿Come with me. ﻿Tomer asked "The One" to say a few words on behalf of his little sister. ﻿For years, my sister looked up to me and my talent and always believed in me. ﻿So I'm asking for your forgiveness on her behalf. ﻿Well? ﻿"Airport" ﻿And now... Tomer's fighting for his life in another round. ﻿A new and moving rendition ﻿of the song that made him famous. ﻿Here's... Tomer. ﻿Let's sit on some beach ﻿Live simply ﻿Simply live ﻿Hang out without worrying ﻿What's next, what's next ﻿Let me do you good ﻿Caress you till my hand's numb ﻿Waiting till you fall asleep ﻿Only to see you dream... Stop it. ﻿Stop the music. ﻿Go home, you loser. ﻿I wanted to say something to the audience. ﻿First of all, thank you very much for your support and love. ﻿Really, I wouldn't have made it here without your love and support. ﻿Tomer, you're gorgeous, I love you. ﻿But that's why it's important to me that you know something. ﻿I always thought I was bringing my truth here. ﻿But there's not an ounce of truth on this stage. ﻿Yeah, Tomer, you're right! ﻿Get ready for commercials. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Go home! ﻿Get ready. ﻿Dim the lights. ﻿Come on, come on. ﻿Tomer, the man. -He's coming back... ﻿Wait, wait, wait. ﻿You're not cutting to commercials. Stay. ﻿Rotem, we love you. ﻿Stay on him. Camera 2, close on him. ﻿Tomer, I love you. ﻿Put the background on, now. ﻿Let's sit on some beach ﻿Live simply ﻿Simply live ﻿Hang out without worrying ﻿What's next, what's next ﻿Let me do you good ﻿Caress you till my hand's numb ﻿Waiting till you fall asleep ﻿Only to see you dream... ﻿Don't worry, honey, you're young. ﻿Maya, let's go away from here ﻿Sit together ﻿Be together ﻿And I'll turn on your light ﻿To turn off your fear ﻿Maya, let's go away from here ﻿Sit together, be together ﻿And I'll turn on your light ﻿To turn off your fear... ﻿I can't believe it. Look what I'm going to do now.
