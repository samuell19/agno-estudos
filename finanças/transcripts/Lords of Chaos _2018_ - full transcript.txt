Look how much fun we have on the streets of Oslo on a normal day. And that's our king with his cool top hat. This is where I live with my typical Norwegian family. That's my dad's Volvo in the driveway. My home country... gray, boring, seal clubbing, and a very high suicide rate. And that's me. An average teenager, you may think, but you couldn't be more wrong. I am Oystein Aarseth, A.K.A. Euronymous. I was brought to this world to create suffering, chaos and death. This is my story. And it will end badly. Cut him. - What? - Cut him. Uh, but why? - Get off! - You started this? - Do it! - Get off! Fuck is wrong with you? OYSTEIN'S MOTHER: What are you guys doing up there? Such a dick! Four-string crush-fucker Necrobutcher! And on drums, give it up for the devil's favorite demon, Manheim! We are Mayhem! (PLAYING HEAVY METAL MUSIC) Mom, tell her to get out of here! You guys suck. Get the fuck out of here. (SINGSONG VOICE) Get the fuck out of here. Go! Get out! Go! Again. Life was so easy back then. It was all about having fun, getting drunk, playing hard, and loud music. - MAN: Hey, hey! - Oh, fuck. We didn't give a shit about anything else. - Hey! Stop! - Run away, run away! Oh, shit. When people told us what to do or how to behave, we always said... Fuck you! Come on. What do you think? Do I look evil? I like it. Really? - Promise? - Promise. And what happens if you break a promise? Satan comes after you. (GRUNTING) I am the beast! - I am the beast incarnate. - Ahhh! Hey, guys, this is Jorn. - You can call me Metalion. - Let's do it. - Yeah, that's great. - Come here. METALION: Yeah. Fuck, yeah! Get off of me. OYSTEIN: We were world-famous all over Oslo. We even had fans, real fucking dedicated Mayhem fans. And then our idiot drummer decided to leave the band. Laters. So we upgraded with this handsome fellow, Jan Axel, A.K.A. Hellhammer. One, two, three. So now I got the best drummer in Norway, a mad kick-ass bass player, and I came up with this new guitar sound that would change the world forever. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Norwegian Black Metal! But we needed one more thing to complete the band. A strong front man and lead singer. We searched the world and one day, we got a reply. - What the hell is that stink? - Fuck me. - Oh, fuck. - What? OYSTEIN: Oh, fuck. HELLHAMMER: Oh, fucking disgusting. Don't you fucking puke in my dad's car. - Watch out, man. - (HORN HONKING) Fuck. Shit, man. The tape, don't throw out the fucking tape. HELLHAMMER: This better be good. (HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING) OYSTEIN: Holy shit. We never heard anyone sing like that. It was beautiful, the perfect voice for Mayhem. - Suck a dick! - Die! - Satan fucks children. - (LAUGHS) OYSTEIN: I had to get him. Turns out he wasn't from Transylvania at all, but from Sweden, our next-door neighbor. He packed up all his shit and headed to Norway to join my band. - Shit. - OYSTEIN: What? What the fuck? Hey, hey, hey, don't touch that. His name was Pelle Ohlin... Uh... ...but he called himself Dead. All right. And together, we moved into this luxurious villa in the province of Kraktorp. Pelle, you in there? Are we ready to rock? We isolated ourselves and focused on our dark, evil music. (MAKING GUTTURAL NOISES) After a year together in the house, we became close friends. He could not hide his darkness and depression. As a child, he was bullied and beaten up so bad, he actually died for a moment. That moment came to define his whole existence. He devoted his life to death. You know, there's a way out if you're so fucking depressed. One shot to the head, and it's all over, no more pain. Come on, fucker. Get up! And he hated cats more than anything. Hey, there's a cat out there. - For real? - Swear to God. - Let's blow the little fuck to pieces, huh? - Oh, yeah. Ahhh! DEAD: Where is it? - There he is. - There we go. There it is, the little fucker. Still there? Do it. What? Pull the trigger. Fuck, do you mean it? You said it yourself. "One shot to the head, and it's all over." Come on. Pull the fucking trigger! Ugh! (ALL CLAMORING) (ALL SCREAMING) (HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING) Don't smile. You'll fuck up the makeup. Sorry. This is not a joke. You are terror incarnate... Terror incarnate... terror... Yeah. - Ruler of chaos and death! - Yeah. And remember, you have to get your poses right, too. Ahhh! Everyone around you are disgusting, worthless little insects. We are the Lords of Chaos. Destroyer of worlds. No? One, two, three. Fuck! (MAN YELLING) Hail Satan! Metalion, Jorn, take our picture. Fuck, yeah. All right, what do you think? Yeah? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa/ Fucking pumas incoming. (MAN GRUNTS) Jorn. Ann-Marit, this is Oystein. - Euronymous. - Sorry, um, Euronymous. Are you in the band or something? - I'm the leader of the band. - What band? Mayhem. Never heard of you guys. You will. You will! Okay. - Fuck, man! - Sorry, man. I'm sorry. (EXCLAIMS) Die, motherfucker! I want to fucking die. What are you doing? HELLHAMMER: This is, like, way worse than... - What the fuck is that? - It's my stage clothes. OYSTEIN: Dead's raw talent, dedication, and fucked-up brain became a big influence on all of us. And it was time to introduce the more evil-than-ever Mayhem to our local black metalheads, and create some chaos. What are you doing? What's in the bag? Inhaling death. Oh, fucking disgusting! Argh, what the fuck? Fuck! What the fuck! Is that real? PHOTOGRAPHER: That's it, yeah. - One more. Grab his hair. - Ahhh! OYSTEIN: Alright, let's go. Showtime. Let's go, go, go. HELLHAMMER: Good luck, guys! What's up? (ALL CHEER) (YELLING INDISTINCTLY) (METAL MUSIC PLAYING) (ALL CHEERING) (LAUGHS) How are you? You guys are the best metal band in the world. - OYSTEIN: Yeah! - Fuck yeah! Mmm. We're not just a fucking metal band. I'm sick of all those speed and death-metal bands, all that Swedish shit. All they do is celebrate life and party. They should just call it life metal. (ALL LAUGHING) We play Black Metal, true Norwegian Black Metal, and... Lokringer plate ready for pickup. - Fuck off... - You guys were very good. The gig is very good. My name is Kristian. I'm from, uh... Oh, shit. I'm... I'm from Bergen. Scorpions? OYSTEIN'S MOTHER: Drive carefully, darling. (TELEPHONE RINGING) OYSTEIN: You've reached Hell House... The Prince of Darkness, Euronymous and Dead the Corpse. Can't come to the phone right now because we're too busy sacrificing little children to Satan! Ha, ha, ha, ha! Hi, Pelle. It's Dad. I have some good news. We got the letter today, and you got accepted to university. Congratulations! Also, we're going to the summer house, and we would love it if you'd come. Pelle, you lazy fuck! Fucker. All right. Oh, fuck. You jerking off again? Fuck. Why did... Fuck! How could he... We just... (PHONE RINGING) WOMAN: (ON PHONE) What's your emergency? Hello? Hello? Pelle's not home. Back to Sweden? No, he blew his head off. OYSTEIN: Did you get them? I got them. Ooh. This is the one. This is gonna make us famous. Mayhem will be the band with the singer who blew his head off. Hey. We should say I ate a piece of his brain, too. Yeah. (LAUGHS) I got something for you guys. This is good. Every member of Mayhem will wear this at all times from now on. It's him. Cool. - What do you mean, "It's him?" - It's him... Dead. Oh, what the fuck? - What the fuck are you doing? - What the fuck am I doing? No fucking way am I wearing that shit. It's sick! He was our friend, and now he's fucking dead. I don't have any friends, nor should you. - This is so fucking wrong. - It's supposed to be wrong. People are supposed to hate what we do. People are supposed to think we're fucked in the head. Well, you fucking are. You do as I say, or you're out of my band. - It's your band? - Mmm-hmm. You're fired. Get the fuck out of my face. You've gone too far. Shit, man. Jorn, come back. - He's coming back, right? - No. No. He's replaceable. He's replaceable! OYSTEIN: I had to get out of that fucking house. I couldn't deal with it. It was time to move into the next chapter of my story and fulfill one of my dreams. BOTH: Ahhh! So with a little help from my friendly father, I opened my record store, Helvete, Norwegian for "Hell." - Welcome. - (ALL EXCLAIMING) I wanted to create a place for me and my people, a temple for evil, chaos, and black metal. I like your new place, Euronymous. I've been planning this for years. This place is for us and us only, the Inner Circle, the Black Circle. I was building my own empire. Everything that happened made me immune to reality. I had no more limitations. I could do whatever the fuck I wanted. Nothing could stop me. (HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) Why do you sell this shit? I thought this place was true metal. It is. I got music you can't find anywhere else in the world, just not on display for posers. So where is it? If you know it, you'll find it, but a poser won't find shit. - You wanna buy it or listen to it? - Both. I released that on my record label, Deathlike Silence. Beer! (METAL MUSIC PLAYING) No thanks, I don't drink. You want a glass of milk? What's your name? Oh, it's, uh, it's Kristian, right? Are you a... Are you a Christian, Kristian? Not anymore. (LAUGHS) Not anymore? So what are you now? I mean, I've changed my name to Varg. Mmm, Varg. I like Varg. "Not anymore." Fucking poser. Want some? Oh, no. I... I don't eat meat. - No? - No. - Like Hitler? - Yeah, exactly like Hitler. Sorry about your singer. So you've got, um, your own band, your own record shop, and your own label. Mmm. Each of these red dots is a pen pal who sends me demo tapes, and I sent a few in return... South America, Central America, Poland, Romania. Countries all over the world make dark, evil music. You know why? No. Things are miserable. People are ruled by dictatorship. Just like us here in Norway. Like us? In... In Norway? Yes. The fucking church, they're oppressing us with their kindness and their goodness, brainwashing an entire population with fake empathy and fucked-up solidarity. Hate them and their churches. We should burn them down. You get it, right? I mean, you're... You're a Satanist, right? Yeah! - Fuck! - Ahhh! (MAN SCREAMING) Got something for your label. MAN: Ahhh! Burzum? Who else is in the band? No, it's... It's me. It's just me. Varg, the lone wolf. - MAN: Hail Satan! - I like it. (MAN GRUNTING) Hail Satan! Ahhh! (SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Ooh! Party's over. Argh! Ah. (METAL MUSIC PLAYING) I was stunned. Just like the first time I heard Pelle's voice. Where the hell did this poser come from, and how can he be so fucking perfect? This was exactly the kind of shit I needed for my label. It was true Norwegian Black Metal. Holy shit. Faust, you have to listen to this. It's a fucking masterpiece. I had to talk to this fucking poser. (SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Seriously evil music, man. It's perfect for my label. Only one fucking problem, I'm broke. - Good luck. - Hey, wait. Wait, I can get the money. Just please, please shut up. So what, you're rich? My mother will pay. OYSTEIN: So, the poser's mother actually paid. We joined forces, and together we recorded Burzum's first ever studio recording at the legendary Grieghallen Studios. How you feeling? - I'm feeling great. - Yeah. Satan! - Oh, I'm gonna fuck that one. I'm gonna fuck her so good. - (LAUGHS) I want one microphone in the center of the room, nothing else. That's gonna sound horrible. That's the whole point. All right. He had some really bad ideas, but with a little help from me, the end result was True Metal, metal enough for him to become part of the Black Circle. (CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) You know that drummer I was talking about? Bad hygiene... Hey, whatever happened to the drummer of... It's hilarious. Our next album is almost done, the most evil music you've ever heard. It's my band. It's coming out on my label. Cool. So are you planning any gigs? Of course not. Concerts are for those Swedish life metal bands. Exactly. Posers claiming to be Satanists when all they want to do is drink beer and have a good time. I hate that, all those death metal kids with their stupid Morbid Angel t-shirts. They're making a trend out of something that was meant to instill fear. We should put them in the showers and, uh, gas them to death. (ALL LAUGHING) MAN: Gas them to death? Oh! Oh! Ahhh! Fuck off! MAN: You're so fucking drunk, mate. Hail Satan! You should take my picture. Maybe. - You should. - I don't know. - Faust, do it! Do it! - (CAR ALARM BLARES) What the fuck is wrong with you? Okay, okay, okay! That's enough. That's enough. - Let's go. - All right. All right. Go, go, go. Go! Whoo! So is this where you take all your groupies? We don't have any fucking groupies. You wouldn't know what to do with them anyways. We don't want any fucking groupies. We're into destruction and suffering. When people hear our music, we want them to commit suicide. You think we're just saying this? I think it's all just some stupid image. Well, that's bullshit. We're for real. Well, I don't know. Seems like you just copied Venom to me. You know all that Satanist talk was just an image, right? - Says who? - Venom. When they say it was just an image, that's just part of their image. So when are you gonna take my picture? I never said I would. Why don't we go upstairs and talk about it? Why don't we all stay? Take off your clothes. Are you fuckin' deaf? I said take off your clothes. Now. Argh! Turn the fucking volume down. I wonder what it feels like to penetrate a knife into a human body. You should find out. Yeah, maybe I should. Auf Wiedersehen, gentlemen. Please come again. Thank you. Is this, uh, Deathlike Silence? Deathlike Silence! Yeah, that's us. Thank you, Mr. Postman. It's your fucking record. Fucking great. Oh, shit! And they printed it wrong. It should be "Spell of Destruction" not "Black Spell of Destruction." No, I changed it. Why would you do that? 'Cause it's better with "Black." When will I get paid? First we sell some, then you get paid some. We have to let people know the album is out, get some attention. You have any ideas? Thought you were the marketing genius, but I guess I could have some... Please feel free. Good luck. Hey, man, turn it up. - What? - The fuckin' TV, turn it up. ...same church in Bergen. Local police suspect the fire was deliberate. No suspects so far. OYSTEIN: He did it! MAN 1: Who did? - MAN 2: What? - Varg, the church, he did this. That's awesome. - Fuck. - That's cool. I said we needed promotion, and he fucking did it... - Holy sh... - ...and I told him to do it. - Fuck, this is so cool. - I told him to do it. - Fuck. - MAN 1: It's on the fucking news. MAN 2: Holy fuck! Police are still looking for the suspect responsible for the Fantoft Church burning. - The church had been built in... - MAN 1: Holy shit. MAN 2: Dude, Varg is a fucking hero. Fuck! Fucking fuck. OYSTEIN: He did it. And he made us all look like fucking Boy Scouts. Shit... He fucking did it. He's here now. Hey, turn it off. What you did was fucking cool. I've been talking about it for years. I'm glad you got inspired. Inspired? We finally did it. - We did it? - Yeah, that's right. Now, think of all the people who are so sad and broken up about what happened to their dear, holy, ancient fucking church. (MEN LAUGHING) Hail Satan, my lord! Laugh now, you fake fucking Nazi. OYSTEIN: After the Fantoft Church burning, everything became a fucking competition. Whatever I did, Varg did 10 times bigger and better. His creativity was exploding. He fucked anything that moved. He added another stupid name to his list of names... Greifi Grishnackh. The girls lined up for fucking. - Is Greifi here? - No, he's not fucking here. Get out. The world I built was about to fall apart. And how many fucking girls can one fuck? There were churches burning all over. My future and success disappeared behind his actions. Fuck! I had to do something about it. I hereby appoint you bass player of Mayhem. It's an honor. Congratulations, man. Oystein, we should burn one down together. - I don't know, Kristian. - Call me Varg. Yeah, I'm going to... I'm out of here. I'll see you guys later. You've already done it. Yes, but you said it yourself... "We should burn them all down." Hey, wait. For what? You know what was here, this very piece of land, before the Christians came and raped this country? Sacrificial altar to Odin. The Christians built this disgusting church right on our ancestors' holiest site. Fucking disrespectful, isn't it? Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. Ah! - Wait. Is that a fucking... - Yes. Wait. Are... You're just going to... I'm going to leave it there and it's going to explode. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... Six, six... Three, two, one. Fuck. Uh, uh, Kristian... I mean, Varg! I mean, Greifi, seriously, man. Could be a dud. (BOMB BEEPS) (LAUGHS) Yeah, you burn that fucking Bible. Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho! - Yeah! Yeah. - Come on, let's go, let's go. - Whoa! - Go, go. (BOTH LAUGHING) Okay. (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) You're a fucking maniac. Am I evil? Yes, I am! Burn, motherfucker! Okay, all right, let's go. Let's go. REPORTER: (ON TV) Church burnings all over the country. Can you tell us what happened here at Revheim last night? MAN: The only thing we know is that the fire started around 5:00 a.m. in the morning, and it could all be very... Come on, boys. Dinner's ready. It's your favorite. Spaghetti bolognese. OYSTEIN'S FATHER: Honey, have you seen the news? It's insane. There are clear tracks of evidence of Satanic activity at the Revheim Church. Mom, I'm going out. OYSTEIN'S MOTHER: Okay, honey. (PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) I'm right here. You don't have to be afraid. We can do whatever you want. I was exactly like you. Okay. I used to go around carrying all those... Not here. Argh! (SCREAMING IN PAIN) Argh! - When will I get paid? - Anytime now. I need it. I have to pay back my mom. Uh, she'll get her money soon. I thought we sold a lot. Well, first we need to recoup everything, then you'll get paid. Studio was expensive. - I did it. - Earlier today, a jogger discovered the body of a 43-year-old man who was stabbed to death. That, that was you? Yeah. And extremely violent. What... When? Last night. That was... That was a really smart fucking move, man. Congratulations. You'll be the new hero of the Black Circle. We should celebrate. Let's burn down a fucking church, huh? Yeah. Yeah, let's fuckin' do it. - All right. - All right. Here you go. Yeah! (VARG LAUGHS) Hey, come on. Don't just stand there. You're the master of this shit, right? Fuck this shit. That's right. Let's get you good and white. Faust, you do the honors. For Jesus and his disciples. Let's go. (CHUCKLES) FAUST: Whoo! FAUST: Burn the fucking thing down! - Whoa! - Fucking piece of shit. Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! (ALL GRUNTING) - Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! - Let's go! Let's go! (CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) Dude, I'm so fucking drunk. - Hey! - Hey! Nice armor. - Congrats on the fire, guys. - Yeah, congrats. OYSTEIN: Something else you guys should know. This must stay within the circle. Faust killed someone. Stabbed a human to death. Yeah, we talked about what it would feel like to put a knife in a body. - We did? - Yes. I said, "What the fuck? "You should try it." And he followed my advice. So from now on, we have to lay low. - Okay. - Yeah, sure. - Yeah. - Why would we do that? Oh, you know, we've taken it to a whole new level. In what way? Homicide investigation. I'm sure they'll come after us for all the other stuff, too. So we're just going to run and hide like fucking chickens? (ALL LAUGHING) All right. You just do as I fucking say, okay? OYSTEIN: Everything was taken to a new level. Terror has swept across Norway. He was stabbed to death. OYSTEIN: I could feel the cops snooping around the store. The Norwegian police are still looking for the suspects responsible. OYSTEIN: They had their eyes on me. They were on to me. Or was I just getting paranoid? ...police are still looking... OYSTEIN: All of this became bigger than expected. Terror... Our fucked-up fantasies have turned into an even more fucked-up reality. This is not what I signed up for. I wanted out, but I couldn't find the fucking door. The police have launched an investigation. Fuck. All this evil and dark crap was supposed to be fun. I was sick and tired of everything going to shit, so I decided to move forward and focus on myself and the future. REPORTER: (ON TV) It was around 6:00 this morning... Tonight's fire at the Methodist church in Sarpsborg left one fireman dead. All right. Let's go. Stand still. Lift your head more. Move your head. Now look at me just with your eyes. Okay, maybe not. Okay, move your eyes more to the right. There. Perfect. Don't be so serious. Yeah. Sorry. Ow. Looks good. ANN-MARIT: What's on your mind? (GROWLING) Pull the fucking trigger! Ahhh! Good morning. Hey. Ah. You really miss him, don't you? No. This is it, the biggest cathedral in all of Norway. We'll have it on the album cover. Nice. It's from the 1100s. And now, in 1993, we're gonna blow it up. Wait, blow it up? - You guys ready? - Come on, let's go guys. MAN: Varg's already burned down seven churches. I don't get it. You want to have the cathedral on the cover, but you don't want to blow it up. It's just an album cover. No. It's not just an album cover. You have Fantoft on the cover of Aske. You even included matches. That was a call to action. Use the matches to burn down a church like I did. - Come on, Kristian. - My name is Varg. We're in this together. We want the same thing. - We do? - Yeah. In that case, let's get some fucking dynamite... - You guys coming? - ...and let's blow this up. Yeah. I will wait in there. You do what you want. I don't need your blessing. I want you and me to do this together. HELLHAMMER: Let's go guys! We need to get back in there. The fact that Norway is ruled by a dictatorship, and our people are brainwashed with empathy and solidarity by the church, and their stupid Christianity doesn't bother you anymore? Of course it does. I hate that shit. Either you do it for the cause and you take action, or you do it because you want attention and you want to be a stupid-ass celebrity rock star. You can't have it both ways. (DRUM STICKS TAPPING) (METAL MUSIC PLAYING) - (WINCES) - (LAUGHS) So that must be his back, or it's... - I think it's his ass. - Stom... Oh. (LAUGHS) - He got stabbed in the ass. - (PHONE RINGING) All right, asshole. All right. Hello? I'm going public. Public... What are you talking about? I'm going to the press. We have to take this to the next level. The next level is jail. We talk about it in such a way that our identity will be kept anonymous. Wha... What's the point of going to the press, then? We have to introduce them to the Black Circle. They need to know what we've done and that we intend to do more. This is a bad idea. No. I'm not asking for your permission, Oystein. Why the fuck are you calling me, then? I don't care what you say. I'm doing it. It's going to affect all of us. All right? I already have the police following me. They're probably outside your window now. You're paranoid, absolutely paranoid. I'm not fucking paranoid. If you do this, we're fucked, Kristian. Varg! My name is Varg! Okay. Just do as I fucking say, Varg. Fuck you. My name is Greifi Grishnackh. Greifi Grishnackh. Greifi Grishnackh. Ow... Hi, I'm Finn Tonder. And this is my photographer. Greifi Grishnackh. Pardon? Greifi Grishnackh. I'm sorry, what are you saying? Count. Call me the Count. - Okay. - Okay. Sit down. Great. Okay, uh, you called me, so what do you want? I know who's responsible for the recent church burnings. And who would that be? It's... It's a group of people. Um, they call themselves the Black Circle. - How many are you? - Oh, there's six of us, and... So you and the so-called Black Circle, you like to burn down churches. Why? Isn't it obvious? Do you know when the first church was burned down? Uh, Fantoft? Uh, not exactly. The 6th of June, the sixth month, at 6:00 in the morning. Six-six-six. Six-six-six, the number of seconds, so you're Satanists? Whoa! What are you doing? He can't take any pictures of me, for fuck's sake! Okay, calm down. No pictures, okay? Okay. Okay, so... And why do you do this? Is it a protest against society or... Bring us back to our origins. Our origins? Odin. So you believe in paganism, and you're a Satanist, and you're... You're also a Nazi. That's a pretty broad belief system. Well, you know, these things are all connected. That may be hard for a journalist and normal people to comprehend. Yeah. Yes, it is. We are going to burn down every single church and blow up the biggest cathedral in all of Norway, and we've been involved in murder, too. Murder? In Lillehammer last year. The faggot. That was you? Well, um... I can't say. Well... If you can't say, you know, I can't write, so... Come on. Let's go. Wait, are we done already? Wait a minute. Tea, anyone? Anyone can put up some black curtains, light candles, and look evil and scary, you know, with a sword, but you haven't told me anything you couldn't have seen on TV or read about in the papers. - Come on, let's go. - Wait, wait. I know one thing that only the one who burned down Fantoft could know. And what would that be? There was a dead rabbit on the steps to the entrance. Okay. Okay. Let's continue. But I need some pictures. No. I can't reveal my identity. We can work around that. Yeah. There's no problem. No. Tell me everything you remember. - Okay. - You know, just let your hair... - Hang? - ...hang down to cover your face. Perfect. - Can we use this? - Yeah. - Uh, do you have a lighter? - Yeah. - Can you burn it? - Okay. Fantastic. Great. - Yeah. - Perfect. Okay. - Can you hold this? - Yeah. And maybe you can have that. - It looks very evil. - Yeah. Maybe you can just look with one eye, like an evil eye. - Yeah. - You can't see my face, right? No, not at all. What a fucking idiot. Yes, but that fucking idiot will be on the front page tomorrow. (LAUGHS) REPORTER: The suspect, 19 years old, known as The Count, has revealed that he and five other people belong to an anti-establishment Black Satanist... Fucking idiot! In just a heartbeat, the Black Circle became a fucking circus show. Varg was the ringmaster, and we were all his fucking clowns, and he enjoyed every minute of it. Seriously? You guys got nothing on me. So fucking cool. Varg's a celebrity now. Did your father stop paying the rent? I'm gonna fucking kill him. You're gonna kill your father? - That's fucking sick. - No, Varg. - I'm gonna kill Varg. - Oh, okay. I'm going to use this and paralyze that fucking idiot, drag him to the forest, tie him to a tree, torture him to death, and make a fucking snuff film out of the whole thing. For real? He fucked it up for all of us! We're closed. MAN: Hello. I'm trying to reach the guitarist from Mayhem. Who's this? My name is Jason Arnold, I'm calling from Kerrang! Magazine in London. "Kerrang! Magazine." That's funny. Fuck you, Jan Axel. I'm trying to get a hold of Euronymous, the, uh... The creator of true Norwegian Black Metal. That would be me. It's only a matter of time before Kristian... Uh, Varg... I mean The Count, gets released from jail. I said it all along. I'm not saying he didn't do anything, the police don't have shit on him. With the Count locked up, who is running the Black Circle for him? I am. I've been the leader from the beginning, with the Count. Write this... The Count and Euronymous share leadership of the Black Circle, but I'm the creator of true Norwegian Black Metal. So let's talk a little about your band. What's going on with Mayhem? Uh, I'm releasing Mayhem's new album, D e Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. D-E-M-Y. No. Yeah, "Y"... I mean, we... We had a little setback when our singer, Dead, blew his brains out, but... Lots of rumors about photos of his dead body and necklaces made from parts of his skull and you eating part of his brain. We're not normal people. We're not afraid of a dead body. It's not every day you get the chance to see one... Um... Or taste it. Hello? Hello? You still there? Yeah. So what's gonna happen now with the Black Metal scene in Norway? Only the man with the horns knows. We're all his slaves anyway, right? You there? OYSTEIN: Varg was right. The police had no evidence, so they had to release him, and he was back on the streets. Norwegian Black Metal became infamous after our feature in Kerrang! Magazine. Mayhem was once again gaining momentum. I looked forward to seeing him. We had a lot to talk about. Can you fucking believe it? Kerrang! It's weird. Your name is all over the magazine. Says the guy on the cover. I'm on the cover because I talked to the press, and now you're taking credit for that. You were against that, remember? Yeah, I was not against it. - I was just... - Fuck. You always do that. You take credit for everything. You think you're the brains behind it all? - What do you mean? - We all took action, everyone except you. You did nothing. I'm the one hounded by journalists. I'm the one who can't show my fucking face without being recognized. It's worth it, isn't it? How's it feel? What the hell are you talking about? Being a celebrity. You should enjoy the fucking ride. I'm going to release my music on my own label. What does that mean? I don't need you anymore. Okay. If that's what you want, okay. You'll have to find another idiot to steal everything from. I haven't stolen anything from you. You're recording Mayhem's album with money made from Burzum's sales, money that belongs to me. That money went straight back to you. You're the bass player of Mayhem now, remember? I quit. You only put me in the band to get attention. The album's almost finished. It's gonna be big, world tour, everything. Tour? I thought you were true Norwegian Black Metal. - I fucking invented it. - And now you betray it. You're a hypocrite. We should be making true Black Metal music for a select few. Tours are for posers. "Never sell out," that's what you said. Saying things like "never sell out" fucking sells. Come on. I made all that shit up. Nobody gave a shit about us. I attracted people by saying, "You can't have this..." "You're not worthy." It's just promotion. No, no. Not for me. I believed in it, and I still do. So do I. But it has to make sense. It has to sell. Otherwise, what the fuck are we doing here? You can keep that. That's a piece of chicken bone. Chicken bone? Fake as everything else with you. Fuck. FAUST: Oystein says he's gonna kill him. Says he's going to paralyze him with his taser or something. Says he's gonna torture him to death, film the whole thing, make a fucking snuff movie out of it. So how'd it go? Uh, stay out of it. Why do you care about him so much? I don't. Yeah, you do. I don't understand the strange competition you have with this guy. I mean, he acts like he's the real deal, but we all know he's a fucking fake. Yeah, that's what he says about me. Seriously, Oystein, stay the fuck away from him and sort your shit out. Look, you have this dream, this vision. You were in control. You were a leader. You could still be all of those things if you wanted to. Or are you just full of shit? I just... I mean, things have been really, um... I have to, um... "Varg, attaching a contract for you to sign. "This contract will transfer all the rights to the music and recordings of Burzum "from Deathlike Silence to you. "I promise I will pay back everything I owe you. "Sign the contract and return it in the prepaid envelop I enclosed, "and all our issues will be solved. "Good luck with your music and whatever you undertake." Where are you going? "I hope the two of us can remain friends. "Best regards, Oystein." Me and Varg were over, and I wanted nothing to do with him anymore. I felt relieved. (MOANING) I hope he felt the same. Time to leave now, you fucking whore. So, Faust said Oystein was going to attack me with his taser gun, and drag me into the forest? Yeah. And then kill you and make a snuff movie of the whole thing. But I don't think he means it. Of course not. (BOTH LAUGHING) Ah. Ah. VARG: "Good luck with your music and whatever you undertake. "I hope the two of us can remain friends." "Best regards." "Friends." Come on. Hey! Get up! - What's going on? - We're leaving. - What? Where? - Let's go! Now! - Hi. - Hi. Are you sure you want to do this? Have you seen this? Yeah, I've seen it. Okay, we're gonna say we watched this tonight at my place. To who? Don't ask questions, just drive. Okay. You trust me? - Do it. - All right. (SNORTS) (GASPS) Hold on, hold on. Okay. Sorry. Okay. Oh. Stop... Stop moving. (BOTH LAUGHING) (HORN HONKS) Hey! What the hell are you doing? Getting gas. All right. Do it quickly. We gotta keep going. - I don't have any cash. - Fucking... Goddamn it. You fucking... Well, me neither, and we can't use my credit card. We've just got enough gas to go back home. Let's go back. Here. Take it. I'll report it stolen. - Now! - Okay. Fuck! Fucking idiot. You wanna hang out tomorrow? Maybe. - We'll see. - Yeah. We'll see. - Okay. - All right. - I'm gonna leave now. - All right. I'll see you later. Bye. - VARG: Let's go. - Okay. - Let's go! - Okay! (DARK AMBIENT MUSIC PLAYING) (DOOR BUZZING) Hello? VARG: Open up. - Who's this? - It's me, Varg. What the hell are you doing here? I brought the contract you sent. Why? You wanted me to sign it, and I did, here I am. Could have just fucking mailed it. Yes, I could have. But I wanted this done right away, so I came over. - All the way from Bergen? - Yes. - In the middle of the night? - Yes. I'm here now, so why don't you just open the fucking door? (DOOR BUZZES OPEN) Hey. Nice hairdo. You gonna let me in? Yeah, come on. You signed the contract? Yeah. All we need now is for you to sign it. Right. And then you and me are history. Yep. It's a small world, though. What do you mean? We're gonna bump into each other. What are you trying to say? Take it easy, man. We're cool, okay? Okay. Like you said in your letter, friends. Where are you going? To get a pen, to sign the contract. You're going to get your fucking Taser. - My what? - Stop treating me like an idiot! - I know what you're up to. - No, no, no. What the hell are you talking about? You pretend to be my friend so you can hit me off guard. I'm not gonna let that happen, cocksucker. Whoa. Okay, what the fuck are you doing? Oh! Wh-why... Why did... Hold on, hold on, hold on! Oh. Fuck. Um... Um, okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay. Just wait. Just wait. Stop talking, you piece of shit. Just leave, okay? It's okay... It's okay. We just forget about all this. - No, we can't. - Yes. Yes, we can. We can make a... We can make a thing out of this. Oh! What thing? Just think about it for a second, okay? We can spread a rumor that you almost killed me. This could make us look really fucking evil. Yeah. As always, you don't get it. No, I'm serious! I'm serious. This is genius. This is really smart. It's fucking genius. - I said shut the fuck up. - Okay. Okay. Um, I don't... Okay... All right. What are you looking for? A knife so you can kill me and make a snuff film out of the whole thing? Stop running away, you little pussy. What's your big plan now, genius? Come on. There you go. Your stupid contract is signed, sealed, and delivered. You happy now? Come on. Help! He's trying to kill me. "Help! Help! He's trying to kill me, help!" - Open the fucking door. - "Help!" He's killing me. Oh, stop. Stop it. Yeah. Oh... Where... Oh. Oh... You just... Why did you do this? You said you were going to kill me. I wasn't gonna do that. I... You know me. You're my friend. I just talk. You know, I just talk. Exactly. You're an embarrassment. That's all you do is talk. Wait. - That's why you're going to die. - No, no, no. No, no! No, no, no, no. (DOOR OPENING UPSTAIRS) OYSTEIN: There you have it, my story.
