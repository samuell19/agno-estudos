- I don't know why it's not working. Well, did you try turning it off and on? - Yes, and it's frozen and asking for your system password. - Oh, um... Can you wait until I get home? Because I'm just picking up some snacks for Max's lunch tomorrow. - Come on. You don't remember? - No, it's not that I don't remember. It's just that it's really embarrassing. - Now you have to tell me. - Uh, Dave loves Karen's butt... exclamation mark. (Woman on phone laughing) - That definitely sounds like my brother. I'm guessing that's all lowercase. - Ha ha, very funny. I should probably change that soon, huh? - You'll change it when you're ready. - Have you had this medication before? - Yes, but apparently, we needed to goose the dosage a little, mostly to help me sleep. - I see. - And for a little impulse control, some mood stabilizing, you know, the basics. - I'll have that ready for you in about 10 minutes. - That sounds great... Janice. Hey, we're both J names. I'm Jeremy. - Ten minutes. - OK, so, did it work? - No, it's still frozen. - OK, well, I'm gonna be home soon. - OK. Oh, hey, um, would you mind, like, grabbing some snacks or something since you're there? - Somebody got the munchies? - It's a good one. - OK, thank you! - Bye. - Give me your patches. - What? - Your Fentanyl patches, now. - Um... Oh God, they're in a... It's a--it's a time-delay safe. - How long? - Not a minute. Not even... Please don't hurt me. - Shut up. - Hey, Au--aunt Sophie, where's Mom? - I'm actually just on the phone with her. - Why is Max up? No, he needs to be in bed right now. (Breathing heavily) - You know, they say that if you stare at each other for 4 minutes straight, you'll fall in love. Maybe for you, give her six. (Grunting) OK, jeez! Take it easy, man. - You wanna die? - I can't say I haven't thought about it. - (Whispering): He's got a gun. - What's going on? (Screaming) - Hey! No. No. Nobody move! No! - Nobody has to get hurt. - You stay out of this. - Karen? - Don't move! - No! - Karen, can you hear me? - Why don't you take what you want and be on your way? OK? (Breathing heavily) No! (Gasping) - Karen? Are you still there? Karen? (Breathing heavily) - Freeze! (Screaming) - Ma'am, are you all right? (Breathing heavily) - You OK? (Breathing heavily) - (Officer): Do not move! Put your hands on top of your head! - Yeah, yeah. (Officer talking on radio, indistinct) - Can we give you a ride home? - Uh, no, I'm OK. Thank you. I live, uh, a couple blocks away, on 10th, so... - Well, if we need anything, we'll be in touch. Hey, you're a lucky lady. - Oh, um... - Hey! Where do you think you're going? - I need to thank her quickly. - I need to get your statement. - It will only take a second. Please don't touch me, please. - All right, all right. You OK? - I'm fine. Can I please get her name and number, then? - Um... - Her name and number. - No, I can't do that, sir. (Sighing) (Line ringing) - Hello, you've reached the personal line for Dr. Koerner. Please leave me a message after the tone. (Voicemail beeping) - Doctor, it's--it's me, it's Jeremy. You will never guess what happened to me tonight. Ah! Give me a call back. I--I--I'd love to tell you about it. OK. (Jeremy chuckling) (Exhaling slowly) - I don't know what got into me. That was so irresponsible! - Don't you mean heroic? - No. I'm all that Max has got left now. - Hey... - No, no. I didn't mean that you're not a lifesaver. Of course you are. My God. I just mean he's not your responsibility. - I don't see him as my responsibility. He's my nephew. And you should know that if anything were to ever happen to you, I mean, I'd look after him. (Sighing) - OK, well, I should go and check on him. I still have to get this file done tonight. - I'm sure your boss will understand if it's a little late. - OK, well, I can't afford to have him understand. I need him to give me this promotion. - You just went through a traumatic event. - And if I start slacking off now, I'm going to be going through another traumatic event in a couple of weeks. - Which is? - The mortgage is up for renewal. And the bank needs me to requalify. - Isn't that automatic? - Not when the main breadwinner dies. (Clears throat) - What happens if you don't get it? - They make me sell the house. - Why didn't you say anything? - Because if I get the promotion, this whole problem goes away. - OK, well, what are you waiting for? Go upstairs, kiss your son goodnight and get back to work. - Thank you. (Whispering): Goodnight, sweetheart. - Mom? - Oh, I didn't mean to wake you. - Are you OK? - I'm fine. - What happened? - Um... (Clears throat) You know what? It was nothing. We got disconnected for a moment, and your aunt Sophie got really worried, but I'm fine. OK? So, you go back to bed, and I'm gonna go put a treat in your lunch for tomorrow. OK... (Phone ringing, men and women chatting) I have the files here. - Already? You must have been up all night. - Oh, I know I probably look like it. (Chuckling) - Impressive! Nice work! - Thank you, Rob. - Oh, and Lance is out of the office today. Um, would you mind taking care of one of his clients? The guy's got questions about the audit prep. - Yeah, of course. When is he coming in? - He's in the board room now. - Oh! - Yeah, is that a problem? - No, not at all. Great! - Oh, Karen! Do you want to sign this card first? We're having a birthday thing for Bernadette at lunch. - Oh, sure! Yeah. - (Man): Tell you what, let me bring it by tomorrow. - Sorry to keep you waiting. - Hi! It's no problem. - Oh! Oh my God! - Are you OK? - I'm fine, I'm fine. No, no! I got it. - Here, let me help you. - No, no, no, no! I'm--I'm OK. Thank you. I'm OK. I got it. I'm so sorry about that. - It's no problem. - Please sit down. (Sighing) - You sure? - Yeah. I'm so sorry. (Birds chirping) - Hey! - Oh! - Oh! I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. It's--it's Jeremy. The guy whose life you saved. - Right. Yeah, you look a little different. - I feel different. I feel like a new man, thanks to you. - Um, how did you know where I live? - I don't. I--I--I didn't. I just--I--I live in the area, actually, and I was driving by, and, um... This is so weird. I--I don't even know your name, actually. - Karen. - Karen! It's really good to see you again, Karen. (Chuckling) You look well. (Clears throat) - Thank you. - How have you been? - Since last night? (Laughing) Uh, tired. Busy. - Well, what can I do to help? - With what? - Anything! Uh, you know what? Let me--let me back up a little bit. Um... You didn't just save my life last night. You know? You--you really saved my life. - OK, well, I'm just really glad that, um, everything worked out. - I--I--I was stuck. Um... It was like I--I was trapped inside of a rock in my life. I couldn't get out. And--and then you came along, and you just... You cracked it wide open. I--I--I'm so grate--grateful. - My crew is here... - Hey! - ...so I should get going. - Who do we have here? - Uh, this is my sister-in-law, Sophie, and this is my son, Max. And this is Jeremy. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - Hi! - I really like your kicks. - Thanks! - Are those the, um, Lot Forty Fours? - They are indeed. Good eye. - I didn't think that they were out yet. - They're not. Uh, the company used to be a client of mine, so sometimes, they'll send me samples. - Lucky. - Well, they certainly are colorful! - Max, do you know that your mom is a hero? - Hmm? She stood in front of a gun for me. We could have died. - What? - OK, can we bring him inside now? - Yep! Come on, pal! - Thank you! - Nice to meet you, Max! Sophie. - All right. - I'm sorry. Did I say something? - You know, I was just really trying to spare him all the grizzly facts, so... - Oh, of course! I am so sorry. (Scoffing) Look, Karen, my point in all of this is to say that I--I really want to pay you back. - That's really not necessary. - What do you need more than anything in the world? - Look, I--I appreciate the gesture. I really do. But what I really need right now is just to go inside. - OK, I--I know that I just swooped in and I dropped this on you. And--and we don't have to solve everything right now. - There's really nothing to solve. (Sighing) - Let me just take you to dinner, at least. Not like a date or anything. - No, I--I didn't think, um... What I mean is dinner is actually a really difficult time for me to get away. - Well, lunch then. I could bring something to your work. You've gotta eat, right? - I--I don't know. I'm... (Inhaling deeply) - Karen, we shared a crazy experience last night. And--and, um... You know, it would really just mean a lot to me if we could share a meal. - So, that was kind of weird, right? - You did just save the guy's life. - Right. And now I have to have lunch with him. - Come on! It's just lunch. I mean, you can afford to take a break and let someone do something nice for you. - I should have asked him to send me to the spa. (Thudding sound) Mmm. I'll be right back. Can you put these away, please? - Mm-hmm. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Hey, Calvin! Listen, uh, the bank called, and your rent check bounced again. - No way! - Way! - I guess I don't have it now. - Do you know when you will? - Soon! Yeah, I'll let you know for sure. - Listen, you know, every time you do that, the bank charges me $35. - It's fine. - What do you mean, "It's fine"? - I'll get you the money as soon as I get the money. - OK, can you tell me, like, when? - Look, lady, I don't know right now. OK? What more do you want me to say? - I--I want you to tell me when I'm gonna get the rent. - I gotta go. (Thudding sound) - Honey, what are you doing? Mmm, not talking to me, huh? Look, if I get this promotion, then we can afford to get you your room back. Look, I'm not sorry, you know. Because keeping things from you doesn't mean that I don't trust you, OK? No? OK. (Phone chiming) (Sighing) (Sirens wailing in distance) (Exhaling sharply) - Karen! - Hi! Wow, that is quite the spread! (Laughing) - Yeah, I--I wasn't sure what you wanted, so I got a bunch of things. - I can see that! - Yeah. - It's very impressive. (Sighing) You know, I would have been happy with just subs. - Oh, I got those too! Uh, capicola and veggie. - Uh, thanks! I think I'm going to start off, uh, with a bit of the tuna, if that's all right. - Of course! Of course. - OK. - Your wish is my tartare. (Chuckling) I'm sorry. I... (Laughing) That was stupid. I--I don't even know what that's supposed to mean. I--I'm a little bit nervous, uh, in case you can't tell. (Laughing) - It's OK. - So, um, Karen, what do you do here? - Me, I am, um, an account manager for an auditing firm. - How did you get into doing that? - My husband died, uh, about a year ago, um, after a short, rather one-sided battle with cancer. And I needed to get back to work, so... It's not like this is my dream or anything like that, but, uh, it's OK. - What was your dream? (Inhaling deeply) - I had it. It was my family. Uh, I know that might not sound very cool or anything like that, but I--I really just loved being a full-time mom. I didn't know that I would. It wasn't part of the plan. I actually wanted to start my own business, but as soon as Max came along, I don't know, something clicked, and I just wanted to be there for all of it. - Well, he seems like a great kid. And you must be a great mom. - Oh, well, if you asked my sister-in-law, she would tell you that I am an overprotective helicopter parent. - Does she have kids? (Laughing) - Uh, I don't think that she's going to be the settling-down type. - Then what does she know? - Yeah. - I mean, you have every right to be worried. The world is a very dangerous place. - Right? I'm almost ready to cave in on getting him a cell phone so at least I know where he is. (Laughing) So, tell me, how does it feel to be retired at, what, 30... - Oh, 6. Uh, you know, it's actually been, um, terrible, actually. - Dare to dream! - Maybe it would have been better had it been my choice. I started the company with my best friend from college. Then, curiously, right before we were about to go public, he decided he no longer wanted to be partners. So he triggered the buyout clause in our contract, which he wrote. Basically dumped me out like garbage. - That sounds like a real betrayal. I'm sorry. - It was. It's unlike anything I've ever experienced. - Any family? - The company was my family. My friends, everything. Then it was just... gone. - Mmm. (Chuckling) (Tires screeching) - Hey, hey! What's the occasion? - Lance! Hey! Uh, sorry, this is my friend Jeremy. Jeremy, Lance. - Hello! - Don't mean to interrupt. Just surprised to see you back at work so soon. - I'm fine. - Great! - Yeah. - I spoke to that client, and he's cool with everything that happened. - Oh! - He's married, so he gets it. (Lance chuckling) - Gets what? - You know, that, uh, people can be emotional. - People... - Yeah. Did I say something wrong? (Chuckling) - Uh, no, Lance, you're fine. - Great! Because I want you to know that no matter which way this whole department head thing goes, I respect the hell out of you. - Well, thank you. That means a lot. - Good! So, uh, duty calls, but, uh, you guys enjoy the rest of your little... picnic. Hey, are those marcona almonds? - Help yourself. - Thanks, big guy! I love these little things. Mmm! Oh! It's the oil, right? So good! (Chuckling) - Oh God! (Chuckling) - Who's that guy? - That guy, uh, he would be my competition for the promotion. Mm-hmm. - Well, I'm sure you don't have anything to worry about. - Well, I do have the best results, but, uh, he's been here longer than me and he's bros with the boss. So I'm the underdog. - Hmm. - Well, I should really get going too. - Already? Oh. - Yeah, I'm... - I mean, you barely ate anything. - I'm sorry. There's a lot going on right now. But, uh, thank you for this. It was very nice. - Uh, yeah. - OK. - Um, you know, if you need anything, anything at all, you have my number. Uh... - OK. - Do you mind if come in with you? Um, I--I--I just, uh, I need to use the restroom and wash my hands. - Uh, yeah, sure. Of course. - Great! (Chuckling) - Just this way. - Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. (Lance talking, indistinct) (Dog barking) Yeah. Brother, you are talking to the right guy, OK? All right. Yeah, anything you need, bro. Don't worry about it! All signs point to yes. - All right. Not a problem! You got it, bro! (Dog barking) (Laughing) ♪ ♪ ♪ (Women talking, indistinct) - (Woman): I'm good, good! How are you? - Max? - Hey! - Hey! I thought that was you. What are you doing here? - Oh, it's where I go for karate. - Oh, no way! I--I, uh, I go to yoga right around here. - Oh, cool! - It's funny running into you, 'cause, um, actually, I--I got something for you. - Really? What is it? - Well, I mean, it's supposed to be a surprise. Should I just tell you? - Yeah. - I got you a pair of these bad boys. - No way! - Yeah. - Where are they? - They're at my apartment. I mean, I didn't know I was gonna run into you. Otherwise, I would have... - Could we go get them? - I mean, it's fine by me. Isn't someone supposed to pick you up, though? - Yeah, my aunt Sophie. But I could call her. Be right back! - OK. (Phone ringing) (Clears throat) - Max, hi! Um, I'm almost there. - Actually, do you think it would be OK if I walked home today? - Are you by yourself? - No, I'm with a friend. - Fine! You don't want to hang out with me. I'll just go see my other friends. Um, your mom left dinner for me to heat up for you. Do you think you could do it on your own? - I'm not sure. - Just call me when you're ready to eat, and I'll walk you through it. - OK. - All right! I will see you later, then! Oh, and, um, let's maybe not tell your mom about this. - Yeah. I think that's a good idea. - Bye! - Bye! (Door opening) All right, let's go! - OK! (Men talking in distance, indistinct) - Hi! Did you see anybody drop this off? - No. But I just got back from my break. - What is it? - Uh, it's... - There you are! Do you have a minute? - Yes! Thank you. - So, do--do they fit? - Yeah, I still can't believe you got me these. Thank you. - I'm glad you like them. Do you like video games? - Oh! Yeah! - You ever played Ninja Raid? - Ah! I'm the best at that. - I guess we'll just see about that, won't we? Why don't you run to the fridge and get us some sodas? I'll set it up. - Are you sick? - Not anymore, my friend. OK... - So, we've made the decision on the new position, and, uh, we've decided to go with Lance. - Oh. - I know you've been busting your butt around here. - Is this because of what happened with Lance's client? - No, no, of course not. It... It's just that, well, Lance has been with us longer, and management requires a different set of skills. - Uh, he certainly does have some skills. The fact I've posted the best numbers in the last 3 quarters doesn't-- - I can understand you're disappointed. - Yeah. Yeah, I was really counting on this. - Well, listen, this isn't the end. Uh, we're going to be doing another full review this time next year. Everything OK? - Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm just, uh, just processing. - Of course. They say it's good to feel your feelings. - So, is that the final call? - Pretty much. - Yeah. - Thank you for considering me. I should probably get back to work. - Thanks, Karen! I mean, you really are doing great. (Sobbing) (Exhaling slowly) (Sighing) - Max! Max! There you are! I was calling for you. - Hey, Karen! - Uh, what the hell is going on? - Uh, nothing! Max was just showing me some of his drawings. - Why? - Uh, I--I ran into him after his class, and I offered him a ride home. - Wasn't Aunt Sophie supposed to pick you up today? - Yeah, but I called her. - What are those on your feet? - Um... - Oh, I was--I was gonna ask you about that, but then, uh, I happened to see him, and I just--I thought that, uh... Well, I hope it's OK. - Why don't we talk about that on the way out? OK? - Yeah. Bye, Max! - Bye! - I--I actually already had the shoes. They were just--they were--they were too small for me, so... - Oh, I just wish you would have asked me first. That's all. - I... Look, Karen, while I'm admitting to things, um, Max told me that you were having some problems with your computer, so I--I... I took the liberty of fixing it for you. - You didn't need the password to do that, did you? - Uh, well, Max gave it to me. - I did not know that Max knew what it was. - I--I had to set you a new one, though, because of the reboot. - But you--you can change it easily enough. Uh, you--you can change it back if--if you want. Look, I--I hope I didn't overstep. Um... - What's your secret? - Huh? - With Max. - Oh. - I mean, he has never shown that scrapbook to anybody, not even Sophie. I mean, certainly not me. - Wow. Um... Yeah, I guess I just--I talk to him like a person. Uh, not to say that you don't. I'm sorry. I... You know what? Being a guy and not his mom probably helps. And--and, you know, buying his affection with shoes doesn't hurt either. - Hmm. Noted, yes. Yeah. Well... - Oh, I forgot to ask. Uh, the promotion, how did that go? - Uh, didn't get it. - Really? I--I am surprised. - You know, there was a small part of me that was too. - I thought you had everything you, uh, you needed. (Door opening) - Oh, sorry. - Ah! Calvin! Would you mind waiting here for just a moment? - Yeah. - Thank you. Is that a new shirt? - It is! You like it? - I might, if you were caught up on the rent. - I told you, you'll get it. - I don't understand how you can afford to buy new clothes, uh, and not pay the rent. - What are you, my mom now? - Hey, Calvin, that's totally inappropriate. - Well, your harassment is wildly inappropriate. - Are you kidding me? I'm the landlord! You owe me money! - OK, it feels like harassment. As a tenant, I have a right to quiet enjoyment. And I have a witness. You'll back me up, right, buddy? - Uh, I--I don't even know you. - OK, just leave him out of this. - OK, I told you you'll get it as soon as I get it. How many more times can I tell you? - Are you OK? - No. But that's about all, uh, I can handle for today. (Door opening) - Hi! - Hey! You have any issues picking up Max today? - Did something happen? - Did you not even know he was with Jeremy? - What? I mean, he told me that he was gonna be coming home with a friend. - Are you high? - No. OK, a little. Whatever. What's the big deal? My friend drove my car home. - I... (Sighing) I can't have you undermining me like that. If you say you're gonna pick him up, then you pick him up. - You're right. I'm sorry. - I have to be able to trust you, Sophie. - It won't happen again. - OK. - I, um, I got your text. I... I'm so sorry about your job. - Thanks. - I also wanted to give you this. I think it's time that I start paying rent around here. - I don't. - It's been over a year. - And I wouldn't have been able to get through all of that stuff with David without you. And to be completely honest, this wouldn't make much of a difference, so... - Do you know what you're gonna do? - Can I show you something? - Wow! - Mm-hmm. - This is all Lance? - Yeah. - Oh! I mean, not exactly illegal, but... - Might depend on the state. I mean, it's certainly enough to destroy a marriage. Unless one of those women wearing a mask is his wife. - I mean, some of this does kind of look fun. - If this got out, it would not be fun for our clients. They are public companies, and they are basically in the business of avoiding scandals. - Mmm. Well, do you have to show this to your boss then? - Ugh. It just feels dirty. - What if it just kind of, you know, showed up anonymously? - OK, do you think Lance deserves to have his life ruined so that I can keep the house? - What if you showed it to him and let him decide what to do? - And then, what, commit felony extortion? Not to mention, the bigger question is, why do I have this? Is there someone out there trying to hurt him or is this someone trying to help me? (Inhaling deeply) - What about Jeremy? - I thought about that. He only met Lance yesterday. It's--it's a bit of a stretch to think that he could put this whole thing together in one night. Don't you think? - Not if you know where to look. - Not if you know where to look. I mean, isn't he, like, a cybersecurity guy or something? - Was, anyway, yeah. (Sophie exhaling sharply) - Just be careful. - Of what? - I don't know. I'm just--I'm just seeing this all for the first time myself. It's just... - Crazy, right? (Sighing) (Exhaling slowly) - All right, everybody, listen up! I would like to do a full review of our client charts, so I'm gonna need you all to send me your complete notes history from the past two quarters. - Um... - Karen! - Why? - I literally just said. - No, you just said what you wanted, but not why you wanted it. - I want to make sure they're being done correctly. What? - If our numbers are good, which I believe they are, this just kind of seems like a make-work project. - Oh! Well, I'm sorry if you feel like you're being made to work at your job. - What are you expecting to see? - I don't know, Karen. But this is an auditing company. We expect transparency from our clients. We should have it amongst ourselves. - I have no problem with transparency. But you're asking us to go back 6 months just so that you can look over our shoulders. It just kind of seems like a waste of all of our time. - Can I talk to you for a second? - Sure! - In my office? - OK. (Inhaling deeply) (Inhaling deeply) - Ah, Karen, Karen, Karen! I really hoped this wouldn't be a problem for you. - Uh, what wasn't gonna be a problem? - Working for me. - Lance, that's not the problem. - Ah, it's all right. I knew there'd be a certain amount of sour grapes. But I can't have you poisoning the well. - I'm not poisoning the well. - Good! Then stop giving me guff and get me your logs! - "Guff"? - If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to worry about! - Karen? - Uh, yes? - Your son's school is on Line 3. - Oh, thank you. - Thank you, Karen. (Grunting) - (Karen): A fight? Is he OK? - He's upset. Apparently, it started over Max's shoes. - Uh, I don't understand. - He was being teased about them. He hit another boy, which started a fight. So we have to send him home. - Ah! Well, that doesn't sound like Max. - It surprised us too. There's just one other thing: He no longer has his shoes. - What--what happened? - Neither of the kids are saying. - So he has no shoes? - Not at this time, no. Are you able to come and pick him up? (Sighing) - I--I'm sorry. I just got called into work, but, um, I'll only be a few hours. - Oh, don't worry about it. I'll figure it out. - OK. OK. - Hey, tick tock. - Yeah, yeah. Just give me a minute. (Sighing) - Yeah, of course. Say no more. I'm on my way. - I really appreciate it. Thank you. - Did you try any of those karate moves? - Well, yeah, but they didn't really work. - That's the problem with a street fight. People don't play by the rules. - Yeah. - The only rule in a street fight is you do whatever it takes to survive. - You mean like playing dirty? - Exactly. - Have you ever been in, like, a street fight? - Uh, well, I guess that's sort of how I met your mom. You know, if it wasn't for her, I'd be dead right now. - Really? - Yeah, she stood up for me. No one's ever done that for me before, not even my own mom. You know, Max, I get the sense that things have been a little bit rocky between the two of you lately. - Yeah, I guess. - You know she loves you, right? - Yeah, but she treats me like a baby. - Well, I think it's just 'cause she's pretty stressed out and, you know, she can't see things very clearly right now. - Yeah. - Yeah. And then, when you're mad at her, and she knows that, it makes her more stressed out, you know? - Yeah. - But that's what I'm here for. I'm here to help her out so that she can relax and you guys can have fun again. And I'm here to help you out too, which means that I'm gonna get your shoes back. - Really? How? - You just leave that to me, OK? - OK. - Here, you drive. Actually, it drives itself. (Laughing) - Hey, you wanna come in and hang out? - Um, I mean, don't you have homework to do or... - What if I get it done fast? - OK. Hey, um, I just need to use the bathroom real quick, OK? - OK, it's-- it's upstairs. (Door opening, closing) - What are you doing? (Sighing) - You still owe Karen money for rent? - What do you care? - She's my friend. (Chuckling softly) - What kind of friend? - What do you care? - Touché. (Sighing) Yeah, that's what I thought. (Door opening, closing) (Sighing) - Hey! Do you want to take a quick study break and play some Ninja Raid? - Uh, sure, but you wanna go first? My turns always take forever. - I don't know. I think you might have gotten lucky before. - Yeah right! - Prove it! - OK! - But, uh, wear the headphones, though, so you don't disturb your mom's tenant. - (Man on headphones): Ninja Raid! (Man shouting and grunting on headphones) - (Calvin): What? - You need to pay. (Laughing) - It sounds so ominous. "You need to pay." - You need to pay or you need to leave. - Yeah? Yeah, what are you gonna do? You gonna fight me? - Just pay her what you owe her! - Oh, I--I will. - That's not good enough. - Who are you, anyway? - Hey! Don't bully me! (Laughing) - Don't--don't bully you? - Yeah! - Yeah? What-what are you, 13? Huh? - Stop. - Huh? - Stop it! Stop! - Huh? - Oh God! (Breathing heavily) Calvin! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Hey! I'm sorry! (Breathing heavily) It's OK! Hey, wake up! Oh God! Oh God! (Breathing heavily) OK, OK. Come on. (Grunting) (Grunting) OK. (Breathing heavily) (Grunting) - Hello? Anyone home? (Breathing heavily) Hello! - Hi, Aunt Sophie! - Hi! (Laughing) (Breathing heavily) Jeremy? Calvin? - Whoa! (Gasping) - Oh! You scared the crap out of me! - You too! Oh my God! - You didn't hear me call your name? - Oh, I--I... I heard you call Calvin's name. Everything OK? - What are you doing down here? - Karen asked me to pick up Max from school. And I--I figured I would make dinner, so I-I came down to see if there was anything in the freezer. - That's all right. You don't have to worry about it. - OK! Well, I'll just put these back, and, uh, I'll meet you upstairs. OK? - Are you OK? - I'm great! - Great. - OK, I'll just put these back. (Bones cracking) - You coming? - Uh, in a second! (Breathing heavily) - Sorry that you never got your turn. - No, you're not. - I told you I was good! - You didn't have to tell me that. And, uh, I'll get you those shoes back, OK, buddy? - OK. - All right. - Thanks again. - Yeah. - Please leave me a message after the tone. - Doctor! Hey! It's me, Jeremy. Um, I'm in a little bit of a pickle jar, and I didn't know who else to call. Um, so, yeah, I'm in a bit of a--bit of a jer, uh--uh, in a jar. Um... (Inhaling deeply, exhaling) I tried the old breathing exercises, and they don't seem to be working well. Uh, maybe you know another technique? I could really use someone to talk to right now, and, uh, yeah. It would just be... It would be really great if you could just give me a call back. - (Woman on voicemail): To mark message urgent, press 1. To mark message confidential, press 2. Sorry you're having trouble. (Voicemail beeping) (Sighing) - Hi, Karen! I have a Jeremy here to see you. - Jeremy! - Karen, um, I just wanted to let you know that everything went great with getting Max today. - Uh, how is he? - Uh, he was, uh, a little upset, yeah. Uh, but we talked things through, and I think he's doing a lot better now. - Ah. OK, well, thank you again for, uh, driving out there on such short notice. Um, but, you know, you didn't have to come all the way down here to tell me that. - No. No, I know. I know. I just... I had an idea, actually. Uh, I--I know how stressed out you've been lately. Um, I... - Is everything all right? - Yeah! Everything's fine. Um, no, I was just thinking that I have a place down in the Finger Lakes. Uh, it's only a couple of hours away. And I thought maybe the three of you might like to get away for a couple of days. It's quiet and it's--it's peaceful. And you'd have the whole place to yourselves. And you could actually go this weekend. - Wow! That's very generous. I'm sure it's very beautiful, but I think, uh, right now I need to focus on, uh, figuring out my whole work situation. - Right. Right. Well, it's an open invitation, so whenever you get your work situation figured out, you just... - Thank you. Um, on that note, I should probably get back to-- - Yeah, there's one other thing. Uh... I think I might have, uh, upset Sophie a little. - What happened? - Oh, it was nothing, really. Max wanted a snack, and I went to go get him something. She came home. I didn't hear her. And we sort of startled each other. - I'm sure it's nothing. I'm sure it's fine. - There's one other thing. Uh... (Chuckling) I'm sorry. Um... And I'm not sure I know how to, um... how to ask this, uh, politely, um... - OK. Just-- just say it. - Do you think it's possible that Sophie might have a substance-abuse problem? - Uh, why would you ask me that? - You know what? I'm sure it's nothing. And if it weren't for Max being in the house, I--I... I mean, it would be none of my business. - What happened? - Nothing happened. I just noticed that her pupils were dilated. Right? And, you know, it could have been from our little mishap. You know what? I--I--I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything. It's probably me being paranoid. - Probably. Um, but I appreciate you looking out, so... (Inhaling sharply) - I've taken too much of your time already. I should go. - OK. - Do think about those Finger Lakes. Thank you for coming on such short notice. - Oh, it's you. (Chuckling) All right, bro, what's this about? - Check your phone. Your phone. (Chuckling) - That's not me. - Come on, Lance, don't be so modest. - Oh, I swear. It isn't me. - Save the sales pitch for your wife. (Chuckling) - What do you want? - You took something that belongs to a very dear friend of mine. I want you to give it back to her. - I didn't take anything. - You took her job, Lance. - Huh. So, Karen put you up to this? - No, she didn't. And she doesn't know I'm here. She's not gonna find out either. - So, what do you want? You want me to quit my job? - No. I just--I want you to decline the position. I want you to recommend the person who's most deserving. (Chuckling) - That's it? - I'm not a monster, Lance. I'm just giving you the opportunity to do the right thing. (Inhaling deeply) - Well, what if I don't? - You wanted to see me? - Uh, please close the door. Uh... Lance is dead. - What? - His wife just called. - How? - He killed himself. (Gasping) - Oh my God! - Can you believe it? - No. Did he leave a note or anything? - Yeah, it was pretty vague, though. It just said: "I'm sorry." - I'm so sorry, Rob. I know that you guys were friends. - Yeah, well, not as close as I thought, apparently. I mean, he has two kids. (Sighing) Were there any, like, rumors going around? - About what? - I don't know. Uh, anything. - Um, not that anyone shared with me, no. - Look, um, I know this isn't exactly how you wanted to get this, but would you be willing to take over as department head? - Absolutely. Mmm. - Thank you. (Sighing) - (Sophie): Congratulations? What? I mean, look, I know it's terrible, but it's not like it's your fault. - No, I--I just... I can't help but think I'm, like, at least partly responsible. - That's because that's what you do. - Excuse me? - You take responsibility for things that have nothing to do with you. - OK, well, if I had nothing to do with Lance's suicide, why do I have this? - Mmm, well, did you show it to anyone? - Of course not. - Then... I mean, at least now you have a new job, you get to keep your house, and it's not like you've done anything wrong. - You're welcome. - I know. No, no, you're right, I know. But I still have this. Do you think his family would want to know the truth? - Again, not your job. - Right, OK. - And if you show it to anyone, all it's gonna do is draw attention to the fact that you have a motive. Not to mention pissing off whoever it is that wanted you to have this. - Which has gotta be Jeremy, right? - I mean, he is the one who's hell bent on trying to help you. But it's kind of a very big overstep, don't you think? - Do you think I should confront him? - I think you should cut him out. - Really? - Yes. You do what you want, but I just think that I should be the one to pick up Max from school and karate. - Did something happen? - No, I mean, not really. I just... I got a really weird vibe from him when I came home. - Because he said that you guys had a bit of a bump. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - When? - He came by the office to tell me that Max was OK. It was actually kind of sweet. - What did he say? - He said he thought he scared you, and he felt bad about it. (Scoffing) - Like I said, I'm gonna be the one to pick up Max from now on. - Speaking of, guess who's getting their room back? - Oh yeah. - Mm-hmm. - Guess it's, uh, time to kick that deadbeat out on his ass. Although he may have already kicked himself out. I haven't seen him around the past few days. Have you? - So, what? He did, like, a midnight move or something? - And leave all this stuff behind? - Mmm. - Ooh! Look what I found! - What is this? - Well, that looks like weed. - I know this. What are these, those pills? - Um... That looks like molly. I will make sure to get rid of this for you. - No. I think I'm gonna take that, if that's OK. - Do you not trust me? - I just don't want to drag you into all of this. That's all. - OK. - I'm gonna call him one more time. (Phone vibrating) You hear that? - Mm-hmm. (Inhaling deeply) - You wanna go for it? - Nope! - All right. Oh! Well, he certainly hasn't gone far. (Thudding sound) (Breathing heavily) (Karen): Sophie, is that you? - Oh! (Breathing heavily) Hey! Little man! - What? - Nice shoes! Where'd you get them? - Screw off, you pedo! - What? What did you call me? - You heard me. - Come here, you little-- - Hey! - Shut up! Shut up! - Ow! - Just give me your shoes. - What? - Give me your shoes! - OK, OK, here! (Breathing heavily) - If you even look at Max again, I will--I will kill you and your entire family. Do you understand me? I found you today. I can find you again. (Breathing heavily) (Inhaling deeply, exhaling sharply) (Doorbell ringing) Sophie, hey! Is Max home? - Uh, yeah. - I--I got something for him. Also, I thought you might need a little afternoon pick-me-up. - Who is it? Hey! - Hey! Look what I found! - My shoes! - Where'd you get those? - I just happened to see the kid wearing them. - Wow, lucky! - Right? Want to come in and play some Ninja Raid? - Oh, um, we don't have time for that right now, sweetie. - Oh, come on! Just one game! Karate's not till 3:30. Please! (Laughing) - Just one game! - OK! (Sighing) I mean, thanks for getting me these back. - Oh yeah, of course. I--I said I would! (Whispering): I just need you to do one thing for me, OK? (Chuckling) (Jeremy whispering, indistinct) - Hey, slow down! What did I say? - Sorry! - Thanks. - Thanks for what? - I was just thanking him for being a good buddy. (Chuckling) - Right. OK, time to go. - But we didn't have time to play our game. - It's OK, Max. We'll play again another time, OK? - Exactly. Because that's totally normal. - Hey, Max, don't forget to sit in the back seat and buckle up, OK, buddy? - We got it. Thanks. - Have a good class! Hi! I'd like to report an impaired driver. (Sophie breathing heavily) - Sophie! (Siren wailing) - Oh! Oh my God! Are you OK? - Yeah, are you? - Yeah. Oh God. I just feel a little--a little dizzy. (Police siren wailing) I'm--I'm gonna pull over, OK? - Yeah. Are we in trouble? - No. No, Max. This is--this is a good thing. I am actually really glad you're here, because I just suddenly started feeling really... - Driver's licence and registration. - OK. Um... I, um... I think I might need to go to the hospital. Have you had anything to drink? - No. No, just, um, just a coffee. - Any drugs? - No. - Please step out of the car. - I'm not--I'm not drunk. I... - What's going on? - Nothing, Max. It's OK. Just sit tight, OK? OK. (Sophie breathing heavily) OK. Oh! - OK, you're coming with me. - You even had it framed. - Yeah, just cheap and cheerful. You can get it redone professionally. I just thought you should have it sooner than later for your new office. - I can't believe he gave this to me. - Yeah. I think he just... He misses you a lot, and he doesn't know how to reconnect. - Did you talk to him about it? - Yeah, I--I checked in with him after I picked him up from the school thing, and again when I got the shoes back. - The shoes? You got the shoes back? How did you do that? - He told me who took them. And as you noted, they're very difficult to miss. - And he just gave them to you? - Yeah. (Chuckling) - Wow! (Both laughing) Aw! Thank you. (Phone ringing) Excuse me. - Yeah. - Karen speaking. (Karen): How could you do this? - Easy. I--I didn't. - Sophie, come on. Don't do that. - Come on, what? - Don't. - Do you think I would do drugs, and then take Max on a joyride? - OK, then tell me what happened. - All I know is that Jeremy comes over, gives me a coffee, and then half an hour later, I feel like I'm gonna pass out. - Jeremy. - Yes! - Why would Jeremy want to drug you, Sophie? - I haven't exactly been shy about my opinions of him. - It doesn't make any sense. - I'm beginning to think that you just want to believe that I did this. - Why would I want to believe that? - I don't know! Maybe because you still blame me for wanting to support David's decision to die with some dignity. - Dignity? Is that what you call bailing on your family? Dignity? - He didn't bail. He got cancer. - And he didn't fight it. He got an out of his responsibilities, and he took it! (Inhaling deeply) - Is that really what you think? - Why else wouldn't he at least try to live? - So that he could spend his last days with you and Max in relative peace. My brother loved you. But you refused to accept that unless it was on your own terms. - You have no idea what you're talking about. - I was there. And I saw how you were with him. And you know what? You are doing the exact same thing with Max. - Really? Exactly what is that? - You're not letting him have his own life. And that's the irony. You're trying so hard to help him that you're just robbing him of the chance of learning how to help himself. - You've given this some thought, huh? - He's the reason I'm still in the house. Because I really want him to be exposed to another point of view. - Well, you are certainly being a great role model for him right now, aren't you? - Is Aunt Sophie in trouble? - Yes. (Max sighing) - What did she do? - Uh, well, she's being charged with impaired driving and for having some illegal drugs. - What's "impaired" mean? - Uh, "weakened." She wasn't in the right state of mind to be driving. - Well, is she going to go to jail? (Inhaling deeply) - I hope not. But at this point, honey, I really don't know. - Thank you. - For what? - For telling me the truth. - I'm sorry for not doing that more. - It's OK, Mom. I know that all of this has been super hard on you. - And thank you for the drawing. I loved it. - You're welcome. - Hey, how would you like to have your old room back? - Are you serious? - That sounds like a yes. - Yes! - Yeah? - Yeah! - All right, there you go. Why don't you go inside and start the move? I'll be right there. - OK. (Phone ringing) - Karen! - Hi, Jeremy! - Hey! - Listen, I just wanted to apologize for just running off like that. - No, not your fault. Is--is everything OK with Max? - Yes, no, Max is fine. Thanks in no small part to you. - Oh, it--it's nothing, really. - No, you've been a good friend to him... and to me. - Wow, you have no idea how happy it makes me to hear you say that. - Would you like to have dinner with us tonight? - I would love to. (Chuckling) Yes. - Great! Um, I've got some steaks in the freezer, so... - Um, you know what? You've had a long day. Why don't we just go out for dinner? - No, I really don't mind. - Actually, I'm, uh, I'm kind of, uh, trying to avoid meat at the moment. - Oh! OK. Uh, well, did you have any places in mind? - You leave that to me. I'll text you. - Great! OK. - Great! (Exhaling sharply) - Hey, Max! Is your foot OK? - Yeah. - Mmm, I thought I just saw you limping. - Oh, yeah, there's, like, a little bump or something in the shoe. - OK, well, did you look for it? - Yeah, I shook it for a bit, but nothing came out. - OK. I will look for it. Um, I'm gonna be right back, OK, hon? - OK. (Phone vibrating) - Hey, Max, I have to go out for a little bit. Do you think that, uh, you'll be OK here on your own? - Yeah. - Yeah? OK. Come here. (Sighing) I need you to promise me that you're gonna stay here. - Mm-hmm. - And you're not gonna answer the door for anyone, even if you know who it is, OK? - OK. - OK. - I love you. - I love you too. - Bye, sweetie. (Line ringing) - Hey! - Jeremy! - Hey, Karen! - Listen, um, I'm not gonna be able to make dinner tonight. I'm so sorry. - Why? What's going on? - Uh, well, you know, Max got really upset about the whole Sophie thing, and he went for a walk, and he hasn't come back home yet, so... (Sighing) - I--I'll come and help you look for him. - No, I think I'm just gonna wait it out a bit. - Well, I can bring some food over. We can wait together. - No, I think, uh, I'm not gonna be very good company right now. Rain check? - OK. Of course. Uh, yeah, just--just, uh, text me when he comes home, OK? - Sure. - Max! Max! It's OK. It's Jeremy. You're not in any trouble, OK? (Sirens wailing in distance) - I know what you did. - Ka-karen. I can explain. - No, stay right there. I don't want you to explain anything. I don't want you to do anything else, and I never did. - But I helped you. I helped you save your house. - And I never asked you to. God, I never asked you to spy on my son. I never asked you to put him in the car with my sister-in-law, who you drugged. - Karen, please! - Do you have any idea how crazy all of this sounds? They are charging her with felony possession and reckless endangerment. - No, I--I didn't-- - I don't even want to know what fear of God you put into Calvin that made him take off without his phone. And what's to stop me, Jeremy, from going to the police with that box of blackmail that you sent me? - Nothing. (Breathing heavily) I mean, it's not like they can prove where it came from anyway. No... Karen, Lance, he was-- he was not a good guy. And--and--and he did all of those things, right? - You stay the hell away from me and my family. - No! Karen-- - Stop! - You saved my life. And I know I can't ever fully repay you for that, but I needed to try. - I don't need to be saved. (Exhaling sharply) - Kar... (Stammering) Kar... Hi, uh, Doctor. It's me. Uh, well, I--I--I think I really-- I think I really messed up this time. And, um, I... - Jeremy? - Oh, uh, hi! Doctor, you picked up! Thank you so much! Thank you so much! I--I, uh... - Jeremy, you can't call this number again. (Exhaling sharply) - Why not? - Because y ou're not my patient anymore. (Sighing) - I know, I know. Um, I just, uh... The new doctor, he just... He writes me scripts and sends me out the door. - I'm sorry, but I can't help you. And if you call here one more time, I will have to refer this matter back to the police. Do you understand? Jeremy? - (Sophie): Unbelievable! - (Karen): Yeah. You were right! (Scoffing) - Normally, I'd gloat. But I'm in jail. - How are you holding up? - Not good. - I am so sorry. This is all my fault. - I will accept your apology. But more importantly, your bail money. - Hey, you know that you would be out by now if I had it, right? - I know. - How's your public defender? - Uh, she's-- she's OK. But I don't know. I... I'm scared, Karen. - Hang in there. I spoke with Rob. I told him about everything. He's got a lawyer friend that he's setting me up with. They'll try to get the charges dropped. And in the meantime, I am gonna do everything I possibly can to get bail, OK? - Thank you. - And you were right about me. I didn't have the courage to let David die the way that he wanted to. Because I was so scared of losing him. I think that's why I threw myself in front of the gun that night. It's like I could not save the one person that I needed to the most. And I have been trying to fight this unwinnable fight ever since. I am so sorry. (Chuckling softly) - Just don't stop fighting just yet. Because I need you to get me the hell out of here. (Both laughing) Deal! - OK! - Deal. (Breathing heavily) (Doorbell ringing) - What are you doing here? - Karen, I am not a threat to you. - You need to go! - Everyone needs to be saved, OK? And I didn't believe that until you proved it to me. And I'm gonna do everything I can to prove it to you too. - OK, you need to leave right away before I call the police. - Karen! - No! (Lock clicking) - Hi! I'd like to post bail. I'm wondering if someone here could tell me how to do that. (Door buzzing) Here--here's the deposit that we agreed upon. After I come in and save the day, then I'll give you the combination to the locker where you can get the rest. OK? Whenever you're ready. (Creaking sound) - Max? (Freezer buzzing) (Screaming) - Mom! - Max? Max! - Mom! - Max! Oh God! Let him go. - You remember me? - Yes! Yes, I do. Please, just let him go. - I don't think so. - It's OK, Karen. - Oh my God, Jeremy! - Do what she says and let him go. - What's going on? What are you doing? - I'm making good on my promise, Karen. Let him go. - Ah! - It's OK, Max. - No, it's not OK, Max. - Oh God! Please don't hurt him! - What are you doing? - Little change of plans. - What plans? What are you talking about? - I went to jail 'cause of you. - Deal with me. This has nothing to do with him. Please, just let him go! - She's right! - Please! - Put the gun down! - Shut up! Your gun's not even loaded. - What? Oh God! (Max grunting) (Screaming) Good boy, good boy! Run! - Stop! (Jeremy and man grunting) (Breathing heavily) (Gunshots) - OK, come here. Look at me. We've gotta get out, OK? - Yeah. - You're gonna have to jump. - What? - Listen to me, baby. You can do this, OK? You can do this. I got you. Let's go. Come on. - Karen? Karen! Where are you going? - Good boy! There you go! - Karen! - OK, let go! - Karen! Karen! - Oh! - It's OK! I got him. - No! - Let me help you! - You want to help me? Leave us the hell alone! (Karen breathing heavily) - Karen... Karen! - Let's go! - Karen, wait! You're safe now! (Breathing heavily, grunting) - (Max): ♪♪ Hello ♪ - (Karen): ♪ Hello ♪ - ♪ My name is Joe ♪ - ♪ My name is Joe ♪ - ♪ And I work in a button factory ♪ ♪ I've got a wife, a dog and a family ♪♪ (Chuckling softly) What? - Nothing! Nothing. I'm just having a good time. - Yeah, me too. Hey, are you sure Aunt Sophie's gonna like her housewarming gift? - Sophie's gonna love that. - Hey! Hey!
