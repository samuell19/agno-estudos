Hello, my name is Ethan Hawke, and I just wanted to talk to you briefly about the new film I'm working on called Zeros and Ones, by Abel Ferrara. I've been a fan of Abel since I first fell in love with the movies. He's a completely unique and extraordinary filmmaker. He's got voice with the camera. He has depth with his actors. The work that he's done most recently with Willem Dafoe has been wildly inspiring to me, so I was very grateful to get the script. Especially considering that the script speaks to this moment. Not in any obvious, uh, didactic way, but you can feel that this is Abel's hit on what we've all been going through for the last year or so. Uh, it's a beautiful script. I play a military man. You're not exactly sure whether I'm a good guy or a bad guy, and I also play my own brother, who's a revolutionary. And so, that's very dynamic for me to get to play these two characters that are representing contrasting viewpoints. I think we're gonna be able to do something really special. Uh, I consider the most important aspect of my job, who I choose to work with, that's what actors do. You know, we champion filmmakers, uh, we champion voices. And I'm excited for the world to see Abel's response to-to this wild year we've been living through. I hope you enjoy it. Yo, you good? Still here. All right, here, let me pull it up. Hey, let me... let me work with this some more. What's it say? You're still alive. You trust it? Come on. That's the news to the world. It is to religion that we call you. The religion of sincerity. The best manners, righteousness, mercy, honor, purity, piety. It is the religion of showing kindness to others. Establishing justice between them, granting them the rights, and defending the oppressed and the persecuted. We call you to be a people of principles, honor, and purity. That you may be freed from the deceptive lies, that you are a great nation. Do you now know why we fight and why we shall be victorious? Hey, shoot it so they believe it. Symbol of Christianity... death to the infidels... The 3,000-year war... Jesus was just another soldier, another war casualty... but on whose side? Hey. Come up the back. His father? Your brother... is still in prison. Well, at least he's alive. For now. Are you sure? You tell me. Is that your rabbit? Does he have a name? What are you dreamin' about? Fish? Porcupines? Goodnight. I only have tea. That's fine. Have you figured out what you're doing in my country? I'm workin' on it. Lots of honey? - Mm-hm. - Right. What's with you Americans and honey? You don't care if he ever gets out. He won't last ten minutes on the street, knowin' what he knows. How do they know what he knows? You told them? I heard you're back. Show him. And they're both negative. He's addicted to the screens. In another time and place, it could be castor oil, and I'd call you partigiano. Made in Swiss... made popular in San Francisco, and perfected recently by a chef not far from here. It's quicker and more effective. Ah, shit. No... you don't... Shh... Shh... Where? Where... and when? Okay? It takes more than guns to kill a man. You think I'm your enemy? Yeah, is that what you think? Your fear made me, and now, here I am. I am your enemy, but your enemy won't be gone when you kill me. You can't kill me. Try it, watch what happens. I'll be right back after the sound and the fury is finished. Where, and when? Come on. This machine kills fascists. This machine is my voice. It's the human voice. My heart is the drummer... Okay, all right. You wanna know... you wanna know where the door is, eh? Where, and when? No, wait, wait. I'll tell you... I'll tell you... I'll tell you... I'll tell you where the... where the door... I'll meet you... I'll meet you there. And I'm not afraid to die. And you? You're dead already. I would light myself on fire! How come no one is lighting themselves on fire, eh?! How come no one is lighting themselves on fire anymore?! This country was conceived in liberty, dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. This is a battleground. The world is watching what happens here, and it is up to us, the living... to finish the work of the dead so they will not have died in vain and that a government of the people, for the people, by the people, shall not perish from this earth! Hail Caesar! Hail Augustus Caesar 'cause he-he got it, he got it. And you-you, are you American? You're American, right? I can't see him, behind his mask!

Oh, please, Lord, grant me the courage... ...to love those who hate me so that we may change the world. Grant me the courage to love those who hate me so that we may change the world. So when is this gonna happen? It has been happening for a thousand years. Is he here now? He was born here. Do you remember how you felt when you first put on that uniform? I felt useful. Did your brother ever wear a uniform? No. We had a deal. Oh, my American friend. Always talking about a deal. Hm. You still wearing your vest? At all times, Captain. So how are things with you? You tell me. Stop playing games, imperialist. You worship it. It is time to live it. Oh. Where is he? In training. Don't move! Don't move! I said, don't fucking move! Fuck you! You think we're playing fucking games? Everything you need to know is on this, in five languages. Get it? Study it, destroy it, make it happen. Oh! Oh... - It's funnier in Russian. - Yeah. It looks like Moscow... That's happenin' here in real time. The waiter's filmin' this. The last thing he'll ever do. You recognize the guy? Looks like the boss. And the other guy? His boss. Looks like what he is. Russian SVR. I want to drink for our future big success. Very good. - To our friendship. - Yes. They look like they could be sisters. Know them? Your brother's dead. We're negotiatin' for his body. This is really how he wants to die? I paid dearly for the words you put into my mouth. You fooled me that I can see the hereafter. The time has come. It was told to me from the Holy Father... in his prayer. He wants you to initiate the response. Ask help from no one. They will all betray you. They will deny you even existed. Do you know what happened to my brother? He has risen. He sits with his father now. Aiuto! Aiutami! Aiutami! Aiutami! Okay, soldier boy, hands up! Drop the gun. Nice and easy. Get in the car. Hey, relax! We're all negative here! When was the last time you did some giga giga? Here's the deal: You knock her up and you walk out of here. How's that gonna work? He's a doctor. We have methods.

Jesus. To understand what's outside of you, you must use what's in you. If we hear only what we already know, nothing new happens. The hard road leads to a real life. "I have done what is mine to do. Do what is yours to do," the dying words of Saint Francis. For you. Being out of uniform in a war zone is a crime punishable by death. Listen, soldier, convening with the enemy is a serious offense. Can you understand that? When? When? Did you plan on keeping this to yourself? Have you talked to Steven? You just got him killed. Where's my brother? Your brother was an anarchist. Your brother was a communist. My brother was a revolutionary. - We gotta get out of here. - Where? New York? Shit. When? Right now. Get the baby. It's on. Thank God. Well, the movie's over. Uh, when I first spoke to you, um, I was really just recording a video to help raise money to make the movie. And now, uh, we've made the film! And I just watched it, and you just watched it. When Abel gave me the script and, uh... script is a really, uh, not accurate term for what he sent. I really didn't understand a word of it... Yeah. But I really liked it. Uh, I did, but I didn't know what was happening. I felt like somebody was up to something, and that I wanted to be a part of it, but I didn't know what he was trying to say. And now, after watching the film, I think what I began to feel while we're making it is true. Which is that you're... You can have kind of two opposing outlooks on the world and that they're both accurate. You kind of can align your shoulders one way in which you realize you wake up in the morning and you think, "Oh, shit, I'm gonna die. I mean, this is real. I'm gonna die." And the world is run by corrupt, greedy individuals and there's great tragedy and disease and the planet is eroding. And not only am I gonna die, everybody I know is gonna die. And brothers lie to each other, and people hurt each other. And you just... you just don't know if you can go on, or what the point of it all is. And then almost with-with the same ease, you can align your shoulders a different direction and go, "I was born! Why was I born? I'm so glad I was born. Everybody was born, and the sun comes up and there're flowers. And guess what, a lot of people are really nice!" And there's a kind of pervasive kindness and healing that runs through the world as it spins away. And there's all this tremendous beauty! Every child is a miracle and I wonder why I was born, you know. What I'm doing. Both those outlooks are a hundred percent true. This is part of the movie, by the way. And now it's over.
