The Ming Document from the China Dynasty in 1421 has been informed Muslim sailors have sailed away to the new continent. This expedition was carried out far before Columbus arrived in America. The expedition was ordered by Chinese Hui Admiral Zheng He. They brought silk, ceramics, treasure and various holy books on the deck. Now Mu Lan Pi has transformed into an area called CALIFORNIA, USA. Keep it going! Help! God is the greatest. Leave. Get out of here. They are not here. - Let's check over there. - Okay. I know, my husband. There's only one ship and it will only take four people. Hurry. Wan Yin, take good care of yourself. - Dad, I don't want to leave. - Zhao Lei, please listen to me. You must go. It's not safe here. Zhao Lei, I promise you. I will come back for your mother. - I heard a baby crying. - Let's go and check. You all must leave. Hu Fei! Open the door! Hurry. - You must leave. - Good bye. Hu Fei, open the door! - Where is Ma Hu Fei? - I don't know. - Are you lying? - Just check it yourself. Move away! Search this room. Tell us, quick. Where is he? Come on, let's leave. Abe. Abe. This isn't the first time we've talked about this. And my answer is still no. I don't want to hear any of your reasons. Julia... Now it's your choice. Between us... or this man. - Praise to God. - Praise to God. Who are you writing to? To our mother. But the letter won't change her mind. That's true. But... I'm sure one day she'll understand us. I'm leaving now. - Peace be upon you. - And upon you too. Get out of here! It's probably God's plan that I should lose my husband and father. But God would never plan for anyone to lose their mother. You are no longer my child. So, how was it? Was it fun to play with them? What's up with you? When will we have our own children? Good question. When do you think? Well, at least we're doing our best. And our efforts won't end up in vain. - Hopefully, it will happen soon. - Yeah. So, what's new? Oh, yeah. Gertrude called earlier. Gertrude wants me to cover a story on Zheng He's treasure in San Francisco. Will you come with me? What's wrong? - Okay? - Sure, I'll go with you. - Okay, yes. - I will go with you anywhere you want. A letter. A ring. A test kit. What do they mean? - It means this is a mess. - Come inside. Rangga, do you know why I've never taken any interest in love? It's because of this. What does she want? That's enough. She wants me to marry her? I was going to, but why did she go away? You had your chance. Let's go inside. - Do you believe in love? - I do. - That means you're a fool. - Come inside. Come on. Thanks for spending time with me. I'm happy when you're happy. We can watch movies at home. - I'm bored at home. - I'll cook you something. When will we get married? Marriage is only words on a piece of paper. It's more than just a piece of paper. You miss Jasmine, right? So what if I do? She left me, Rangga. I'm your friend. If it wasn't for you, it would be chaotic for us. Now let us return the favor. With what, Rangga? - The five daily prayers? - Why not? If it helps. - Can your God help me to forget her? - Better. He can get you two together. Jasmine has left me. There's no hope. She told me that... I'll be alone for the rest of my life. - So what's going to help you? Alcohol? - Maybe. It won't solve your problems. It adds more. Do you know why it's prohibited? Because it's a sin? A sin is a sin for a reason. Alcohol destroys our brain. - Look at yourself? - Got a mirror? "Zheng He, a Muslim sailor and explorer from China who explored the world in the 14th century." Isn't it too early for a drink? Who cares? Where have you been? I just dropped off Rangga's laundry. In Islam... all wives have to serve their husbands, right? In Islam... men and women are equal in God's eyes. In my country and in Pakistan women are allowed to lead. We've even had a female president. That has never happened here in the US. - Is that so? - Yeah, it's not about who serves whom. A woman has to respect her husband. The husband protects and honors his wife. In your case, by living together without marriage, it means you didn't respect her. You have to marry her, so you'll become a real man. If you keep at it, I might convert to Islam. I got the tickets. - Where are you going? - All of us are. We're all going to San Francisco. We'll get your medicine. - Medicine? - Jasmine. Hey! Rangga! Don't throw it away. I've browsed several clinics in San Francisco. - Let's make an appointment. - Okay, dear. Azimah... I'm at the arrival gate now. Okay, let me come to you. Is she there? You'll come with me to Chinatown to meet my source, Peter Cheng, right? Of course, Hanum. - Let's drop Rangga and Stefan off, okay? - Okay. Hi, Stefan. We'll go to Chinatown right away. My source may leave soon. - Peace upon you. - You too. Be careful. - Peace upon you. - You too. Take care. Let's go. What about your mother? Maybe after we're done at Chinatown, you can come with me to visit my mother's orphanage. If you point your finger at me again, I'll break it. Peter, you already lost. Nobody is cheating here. Then what are you doing here? Just leave. Thank you. Azimah, according to the research I've been reading... This is... the exact shape of the coin that were left behind by Zheng He and his men upon landing. There's also an inscription. My friend is a collector. She can verify its authenticity. Okay, we'll see. Why are you here? I came to San Francisco with Rangga. I thought I'd stop by. You'd better not. Why? From a Hui man, Peter. Do you know him? So, what about the coin? From its strength, consistency, and metal aging... it's still hard to be analyzed. I mean, from the inscription, this is the real coin. It belongs to Muslim sailors from China. But whether the coin was discovered here or someone has brought it here, it's hard to say. Julia, you've got the discovery of America book from the Hui sailors, right? Hanum, since you contacted me I looked for a book about Zheng He's. I forgot to tell you, this book is telling us about an ancient map, the proof of Chinese Muslim expedition to America. I have a copy of that map. Wait a sec. - Here it is. - It's exactly the same. The map was drafted by Muslim Sailors. Long before Columbus' era. Look at this. It's the American continent. It's drawn here perfectly. Other than the gold coin, there's something more important that the Huis have been searching. - What is that? - The book of life. Yeah. I've heard of that. Zheng He had brought a very valuable book. But no one knows its whereabout. I'll contact you if I get anything. - Yeah? - Peter sold it to a Muslim woman. - Find her. - All right. My mom is an activist and has managed this orphanage. I hope you can persuade her to talk to me. Azimah, be patient. She still hasn't accepted me. To this day, she still believes that Abe was a terrorist. Since I became a Muslim, she doesn't want to see me. I think she's a good person. She has managed this orphanage, especially after you left. Yes, she's a good person indeed. As long as it doesn't concern religion or Abe. As far as she's concerned. Abe and I have caused my father's death. - Sarah's really good at writing poems. - Really? And Abe has saved a lot of people. He sacrificed himself to save the world. This is none of your business. I don't mean to get involved, Mrs. Collins. She just wanted to introduce you to your grandchild. - It's okay. - You must fight for it. She's your mom. - You two must talk. - It's okay. There's no hope for me to get back with Jasmine. Fight for your future. Fight for your child. We'll figure it out. Even if Jasmine ends up with someone, she's still carrying your child. - I want to pray. - Where are you going? - Keep me company. - Come pray with me. - My God's in here. - Move Him then, starting now. Get Him out of your head and put Him in your heart. So you can have a peaceful life. Let's go. - Is it okay to live here? - It's fine. We have no choice. There are more decent places near my hotel if you want me to find you a place. It's fine. It may be decent there but I can be closer to my mother here. What happened to you? What's going on? What is it? - There was a dog. - A dog? Where is it? - Let me check outside. - No, don't. Why? It was following me. I mean, it was running, chasing me. I'm going to Stefan's. I'll check it. - No. - It's okay. - It might still be out there. - It's okay. Get some rest, okay? Tomorrow we'll go to a clinic. I made an appointment for the clinic. What's wrong? You don't want to go? No, it's okay. Are you scared? There's nothing to be afraid of. The lab results are good. Everything's normal. But... we have to be more focused. You shouldn't be working too hard. Answer it. It won't be long. Yes, dear. I meant to say, today... Wait. You know, Peter just called me and asked me to return the coin. This is weird. What does he want? I don't get it. And last night... someone was... That's the thing. I want to tell you that you're in danger. - What? - It's because of the coin. There's something you should know. - Meet me on Kenny and Gerry's Street. - Where? - Okay. - Meet me now. So, are we going to the clinic? You still expect me to love you? - After leaving me so easily? - Mom... Even though I am a Muslim now, I have never left you. You were the one who left me. Mom... if Abe and I have hurt you... please forgive us, Mom. But don't hate Sarah. - Rangga. - Yes? Do you think I can be a good father? Are you asking for my opinion? Yes, tell me. Yes, you can. You can even be a good husband. Why? Too proud? Cast away your pride. It does you no good. I just passed a store, and... I got this for our baby. Stefan, you better go home. Sorry, Jas. I can't even get into my own room. Let's walk over there. Rangga. Jasmine is done with me. Do you know why? She met a rich man. Who takes her out on fancy vacations. All of her friends are socialites. He has a house. She doesn't want me anymore. No. Do you know why she doesn't want you? Why? Because of this. Your life is a mess. - No. - Use your heart. Listen to it. You're home late. Got another assignment from Gertrude? Do you even want to have kids? There shouldn't be distance between us. What are you keeping from me? What is this? I want to tell you the truth. Don't be afraid, Ms. Hanum. I will introduce you to someone. The girl has arrived. You guys? - What's this? - Hand over the Hui heritage coin. It's not yours. It's not with me. Hanum, we're both Muslims. Don't take the inheritance of Chinese Moslems. - It belongs to our family. The Huis. - I really don't have it with me. How much did your boss pay you? How much did you pay Peter? I can give you so much more than that. Zhao Wei, that's not our way. But she took our heritage, Father. She is innocent. She's just doing her job. She stole our heritage. I want to get it back. Stop it. The Hui people have never used violence. We are not communist. These are Chinese Hui people... the majority are Muslim. Among them were my mother... my brother, sister, and also my wife. Our lives were poor... because the communist party ignited the cultural revolution... decades ago. The communist militaries have destroyed all of our Chinese heritage. Including the heritage left behind by Zheng He. That's why most of them were seeking refuge abroad, in foreign countries, when that incident happened. Dad, I don't want to leave. Zhao Lei, listen to me. You must leave, it's not safe here. Zhao Lei, I promise you. I will come back for your mother. Hu Fei, open the door! Wan Yin, take care of yourself. I brought all three of my children myself to America. I don't know. Where is Ma Hu Fei? Check inside! Tell us quickly. Don't lie. We're what's left of the Hui people. We've kept fighting for our cause even to this moment. One thing's for sure, you may step on our pride... and banish us out from our home... but at least we're still standing tall. For... we are the Muslim Huis. Since then, my family and I... sought to collect the artifacts of Islam's great journey. Islam as our religion. And Hui as our culture. One of those... is Zheng He's coin. Enough. Zhao Lei didn't mean it. It's the same thing, Dad. He needs the money to go to China. He just wants to meet your mother. But Mother is already died, Father. Returning to China will only cause trauma. The communist have destroyed our life. At least he can see her tomb. Ms. Hanum, I know your boss will pay you handsomely. If you can find the evidence that Chinese Muslims came here before Columbus. If you want, I can give you other evidence, more valuable than the coin. Enough, Su Yin. Miss... I won't force you to return the coin. As a fellow Muslim, I just wish to touch your heart. And you should understand, this isn't about a family heirloom. No. This is Islam's heritage. Our legacy. I've promised to never sell these artefacts to anyone. That's my oath to history. Hang on. Miss, you have one night to think this over. Meet us at the pier tomorrow. If you choose not to come, consider the coin yours. But please, tell the world about Hui's great sailors. - What are you talking about, Dad? - Su Yin. Let her go, don't harm her. I don't get you. What's your goal? You know me, dear. It's never about the money. I feel that this is my responsibility, and I'm willing. Why won't you believe me? We humans always think we're close enough to God. But the devil always has a way to influence us to think about worldly matters. I may not know the answer to your problem. But you can give me a chance to stand by your side, at the very least. "How are you, Mother?" "Please allow me to call you Mother." "Because Islam doesn't recognize the term of 'mother-in-law'." "Mother... I will never stop thanking you." "For giving birth and raising a child like Julia." Not a night goes by where I don't pray for your health and safety. I just want to see you smile again. Every second I spend with Julia and Sarah... is a God's gift through you. Please forgive me. You... had to do all this. I should've made a decision sooner. - Stefan, I... - No, it's my fault. All of it. I can't imagine what you went through in that room. Well, it happened already. It's done. I've taken care of everything and now you're free. Okay? Wait. You need to know why I never proposed to you. No, listen to me first. I'm a selfish person. I'm scared of commitment. - I can't think of marrying anyone. - Well, that's fine. And if I hadn't left you, we'd still be living the life that you want. Not the life I want. So, we're done. The ship has sailed. I've taken care of everything. And now you're free of your responsibilities. Okay? You're free as a bird. I'm an idiot. I couldn't appreciate you while I had you by my side. I'm sorry for hurting you. I want to be a better person because of you. Jas... Yes, you're an idiot. And you're arrogant. And all you care about is money. And you drink too much. And I can't live without you. Besides... if I don't marry you, no other girl will. It'd be a pity. I thought you... I can make a poker face too. Zhao Lei. You little scoundrel. - So what? - You're a useless brother. - Sister, what are you gonna do? - Enough, Su Yin. Zhao Lei, we want you to come back. I want you to be a good guy. Dad, you don't have the courage to go back to China. You've become a loser in this country. You're collecting useless heritage. - Don't say that to us. - Sister. You're the loser. You better give back Hanum's money. What? Money? - The money from Hanum. - I didn't take it. - Where's her money. - I didn't take it, sister. See? See? I didn't take the money. Praise to God. Thank you. Hi, Gertrude. It took all my guts to write you this story. This is more than just a story for you. It's for all mankind. My journey with Rangga in the US is more than just a search for the missing treasure. It's more than that. If you want to know more about Zheng He and his legacy, come to my country. That was where Zheng He docked his ship and left traces of Islam. But I am so grateful. Your assignment has helped me discover traces of Islam in the US. Perhaps those early settlers tried to immortalize it by naming two towns in this country after Islam's holy cities. Mecca in California and Medina in Ohio. America has invited me for another reason, Gertrude. It is to unite the two half-moons that had split due to misunderstanding, selfishness, and distrust of each other. Rangga and I reunited the lost loves caused by all of this. The love between two people which became eternal after they got married. Even the love between a child to her mother and vice versa. Love as pure as the sun and the moon that light up the Earth that had split because of different beliefs. Because Al-Quran teaches that different beliefs is not a reason to hate. Let death be the judge of our truth. But before that happens, let them love each other in this world as God intended. Once again, Gertrude, I'm sorry, I can't write about the treasures or sailors you asked me to. But your mission has shown me lots of treasures beyond the value of a coin. More than just an item, but the heart. Except one. A thick book that contains God's words on the true meaning of life and death. The reason God created and destroyed the world. That's the greatest treasure for humankind for the rest of time. Hanum and Rangga are continuing their fertility program. After waiting for 11 years, God has given them a child named Sarah Rheashira, Sarah, meaning the wind that brings good news.
