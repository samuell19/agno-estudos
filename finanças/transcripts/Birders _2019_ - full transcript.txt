This is an incredible place for migrants. Where they stop and water and get some food before they continue their migration. The most important migratory corridor in North America is deep South Texas. And right now we have the fall migration going on. The migration is on! The border wall is no barrier to birds. I think birds bring people together from both sides of the Rio Grande. ♪ Well, now, Texas, I'm just a little lost And beaten down ♪ ♪ Feel like a mornin' star ahead of me Fadin' out ♪ ♪ But if I make it to the border ♪ ♪ Of that Rio Grande... ♪ Those stilts are really enjoying the fresh water. They're bathing. Black-necked stilts. Looks like they're wearing little tuxedos. Really cool birds. Back during World War II in the early stages of the war, this was a training area for fighter pilots and there's absolutely thousands of spent bullets just all around us. There's .30 caliber and .50 caliber machine gun slugs. And now it's a wildlife refuge. I think I like it better as a wildlife refuge. We've been trying to establish a corridor where animals can actually safely travel through native habitat along the Rio Grande corridor. So there's a lot of reforestation going on right now and they're trying to link up these little islands of habitat so that the animals can make safe passage along the wildlife corridor. I have recaptured birds between years that breed in Canada, and I've caught them in the same net the next year. And one of the reasons that we band is to show that, and one thing that I hope to show in the future is that migrants also do the same thing. That birds use the same areas during migration every year, and so then we can put a a value on those type of areas and try to conserve them. Call me if you find one. When a bird flies into the net, the first thing you have to do is you have to decide which way he hit the net. So what we do is we go in... and we secure the legs, and then we have one more wing, and he's out. And this... is a northern waterthrush. It is a warbler that is just migrating through. But, migrants, it's very important that they put on fat because they sometimes have to fly long distances without eating. So if you look, uh, you'll see that this bird has some fat. This is the northern cardinal. It's a male. The other bands that I put on birds are aluminum, but this one, because he bites so hard, that we have to put stainless steel bands on him, or he'll press them in. Yeah, he's just wantin' to bite me again. This is a green jay. Each band has a unique nine-digit number, like here in the US, like our Social Security number, to identify it. So when that number goes on this bird, no other bird in North America will have this number. The green jay is a valley specialty, and this is one of the birds that birdwatchers will pay a lot of money to come down and see. This is where birders come to find accommodation, and... books and guiding and tours. When I moved to this area, I didn't have a job and my wife said, "Well, let's open a bed-and-breakfast," and I had to figure out "Who's gonna stay here?" So we focused our marketing on birdwatchers. And we're world famous. We get birders from over 40 different countries coming here to stay with us. This little circle of land here in Texas and in Mexico, it's very rich in bird life, and that, in turn, brings a few hundred thousand birdwatchers to this area every year, and they spend half a billion dollars and they sustain 6,600 jobs. Come on. He's our yard security animal. We used to have a dog back here and they were friends, but we don't have the dog anymore, but we still have Guardian. Yeah, they look like Mississippi kites flying over right now. They're on their way south along the Mexico Coast. That's one of the wonderful things about living here, is migration is very strong. We have more birds than any place else in the United States. And one of the reasons we have all those remarkable birds is we have tropical birds that come from Mexico. There are a lot of mosquitoes here! Gee, wow, had a lot of rain. The King Ranch, The Kennedy Ranch, and the Yturria Ranch make up a vast swath of over 900,000 acres of ranchland in deep South Texas. And many people refer to it as the last great habitat. It's important to everyone who likes migratory birds. It's essential to migratory birds 'cause migratory birds are so dependent on every stretch of their migration. They have to have food, water and shelter in deep South Texas. They have to have food, water and shelter in Mexico. This little guy is an Empidonax flycatcher. Last week this bird may have been in Canada. We like them here in South Texas 'cause they eat a lot of mosquitoes. This is a hooded oriole. This a bird that... breeds in South Texas. This bird, tomorrow, will probably be in Mexico. Careful with the rattlesnakes. People are so attracted to birds. For one thing, they're very visual. But I think really what inspires us most about birds is their freedom, their ability to fly wherever and whenever they want. There are more birds that pass through here than any place else in North America. It's a magical place. Well, at the moment, it's September, so... we do have some radar reflectivity that we're going to look at here, showing what would be biologics. And it could possibly be birds because this is the time of year that we could see birds migrating south for the winter. So let's take a look at some of these images. So here in the Harlingen area, you can see, this morning, birds starting to fl-- take off from their spot. We also have dozens of radars across the country, so you can sort of, you know, go to the next radar and view them in the path also. So, if people were studying birds, they would have a pretty good pinpoint location of where to start looking for them, if they were to go now and look in that spot. Got one TV, uh, turkey vulture out there, John, in the middle of that darker gray cloud. - Oh, he's kiting! - Yes. - Beautiful bird. - Oh, yeah, I see him now. Be nice if he wasn't so far away. - Yeah, he's hunting. - Oh, wow! Man, he's just motionless in the air. What we're doing this morning is hawk watch. Twice a year the hawks migrate as far north as Alaska, all the way down to as far south as Argentina. And then in the spring they move back. Suppose at the age of five that your parents abandoned you. Migration is built into their DNA. It's something that they just cannot resist the urge to do. These immature hawks have to learn absolutely everything they're going to do to survive once they start migration. This is a red-tailed hawk. Um... I actually painted it up here. Yeah, when she comes up to the hawk tower, she likes to paint. And the reason we're here, and that the hawk tower is here, is that, um... a lot of fly zones, migratory fly zones come... pass right through here. So we get a lot of, uh, birds from the east and birds from the west. And so we get to see a lot of different species of migratory birds, and especially hawks. - A painted redstart. - Painted redstart, yeah. The reason we count them is to know what is here now, and the next year, if there are less birds, why are there less birds? Maybe something's happening to them along the way, so... Oftentimes, there's danger along the way, there's always danger for the birds. But there's sometimes danger that's man-made, and that's something that we can do about it. We are about to enter Sabal Palm Sanctuary, which is a very important spot for birders. We will have the special experience of going behind the fence. Well, because they cannot build the fence in the river or just behind the river, because the river, especially at this location, meanders. And so they had to build it behind what they call a levee. We're just going up the levee now, as you can see. Normally, there's a border patrol vehicle here, but not this morning. So we are fine. Oh, here's a border patrol coming. Uh, a couple of Mississippi kites, that's about it, just now. Seems like they're just getting up, you know? So we can actually go birding from here. Well, I hope so. I haven't seen any birds yet. Are we going up the native trail? - I could not see the wings. - The yellow V into the... I didn't see that part very clearly, but the rest of the markings look like Altamira, so... Altamira more probable than hooded, I would say. Yeah. Oh, that's a green jay. I'm hearing green jays. Okay, walk together... - Oh, I didn't realize that. - Okay, there's another. Is that it right there? Stop. It's kind of far. But that might be... That's the kingbird. - That's a mocking bird. - Are you sure? It's a mock. - Now it's too far. - That's a nice picture with that... - ...background. - I've never seen a... It's just supposed to be birding up here. We're working our way down. I'm not thinking warbler or migratory bird. - No. - It was something bigger. More native. We could see something in the water here. It is significant that we're in the United States, but we're further south than parts of Mexico right now. There are parts of Mexico that are north of us and that's not typically understood by most people who've not been down here before or who don't really put that in perspective about where this boundary really is. Our son always refers to our residence as being in Northern Tamaulipas, rather than Southern Texas. We simply have a river that runs through an area that shares the same wildlife. My family and I, um, do birding here... because it has habitat that animals need. AREA BEYOND SIGN CLOSED We are at the Rio Grande river. Um, that's Mexico across the other side and they're keeping cattle over there. I want to go to Mexico to do... just to... see what it's like there and I've heard that the weather's much better... ...than here, and, um... I wanna see if they have different things, different types of birds and hawks and... chickens, I guess. Their habitats have been, um, defiled and destroyed. We are literally covering large areas with concrete and asphalt. And then also the fact that we're, um, closing off areas, which, you know, potentially, that will happen with border fencing. Continuation of the current plan that we've seen would mow down 150 feet on either side of where the fence would be, literally make it just caliche road and no more plant life or wildlife, um, support. So, vegetation means wildlife. If that's destroyed, then their habitat is gone. We think we're very fortunate to be able to be here at a time like this when it's still accessible and when it's still protected. Birds move around, um, much more easily than people do and they go where things are good for them. A bird can fly 300 miles in a day. For them, uh, moving around Texas and Mexico is easy. I'm afraid to travel to Mexico at this time. A lot of stories of people who've been hurt or killed, and, um... I would like things to be a little more peaceful so that I can start traveling in Mexico again. ♪ It seems I'm crossing the bridge now ♪ ♪ From Matamoros Towards Valle Hermoso ♪ ♪ I can see the prairies and my river ♪ ♪ And the songs of the beautiful birds ♪ EL CIELO BIOSPHERE RESERVE TAMAULIPAS, MEXICO In this place we used to have a lot of bird-watching tourism from the US but they couldn't come anymore because of the insecurity in all of Tamaulipas and along the United States border, so, tourism is scarce. BIRD GUIDE I have been a guide for people from England, from different countries of the world. They called me "Blue Mockingbird" because I imitated the birds. It's coming closer. Here at El Cielo we have 216 resident birds and 170 migratory species. They come here fleeing the harshness of the snow. It is very cold in the north of our planet, and they flee to the south. Before I got training, I saw them as food, I ate them. I didn't realize the damage I was doing because we have unique species here. No matter how small, every animal has a reason to be on this planet. It may not sing or it may be ugly, but it plays a role in nature for its own good and for our good, too. LAGUNA MADRE AND DELTA OF THE RIO BRAVO We obtain many benefits from birds. If they give us so much, why not preserve them, protect them? BIRD MONITORS Building that wall will harm nature the most. They don't know about borders. Animals don't know. This is a very interesting and important ecosystem because it is a corridor for migrant birds. They feed, rest, and go on their way. Birds are beautiful, but they are also indicators of how our system, our ecosystem is doing. It caught our attention from the moment we arrived, but we didn't have this awareness before about caring, protecting and preserving. Once we started to learn and know more... now it makes us so angry seeing what people do, seeing human beings be so thoughtless. Nature is so wise and so... Generous. ...generous because it gives us everything we need. I'm going to cry. - Look at that line over there. - Look at the ducks! Look over there too! Black ibis too. There go the black-necked stilts, Himantopus mexicanus. I love how they look! - Look there they go! - Wow! No way! There are more than 200. I think there might be 500. We've never seen so many. - Yes... we have. I have. - You have. I haven't. I have. I identify myself with the Fregata magnificens because my dad was a fisherman and we were always migrating. Until we arrived at this place. We liked it, we fell in love with this place and we decided to stay here. She's not a migrant, she's a resident. She was born here. And she stayed here. Fifty-four. Fifty-five, fifty-six. Who knows, maybe in the future I'll do the same as my mother. You never know. RIVER OF RAPTORS CANSABURRO WELCOME BANDING STATION This is a small leather vest and, in short, it reduces the chances... RAPTOR BANDER ...that it will get eaten during the attack when the raptor is attracted so it can be captured and banded, and then released. It's important to check it, or it could fly off with the vest. Right now I'm working on this project, Veracruz River of Raptors, because I don't know what happened but life brought me here... VOLUNTEER BANDER ...and I became crazy about raptors. Because of geography, this is the channel through which they fly from north to south. They have no other option. This is the only project in Mexico where you can band raptors and work with them by hand. Something's migrating in the mountains. BIOLOGIST When I was in primary school, I knew that on my community's sports field there was an observation site. In the evenings, I would go there with the birders, as they were known by the local people. I would spend the evenings there and now we are part of the project. That vocalization we're hearing is a tropical kingbird. It works for us because as soon as it starts vocalizing, the predator has been detected, sometimes we can't see it, but the bird has already detected it. So, what we do is move the pigeon. To the right. Over your post. It's a harrier. That one ignored us. Sam! Quick! That's what we want to get. Magic inside this hideout. RIVER OF RAPTORS CHICHICAXTLE It came out of the cloud. It's there in the blue part, almost reaching the fuzzy cloud. - It's a species. - It's a species? Yes. Now, around 7:00 p.m. the birds fly down to rest. To rest through the night and then move on... to move on the next day, starting from around 9:00 a.m. They get up and continue their migration. Oh, the hook-billed kite, like this... Uh-huh. EXPERT RAPTOR COUNTER BIRD GUIDE My first year here was 1997. We met Ángel. He was helping out and watching with the hawk watch. It wasn't a nice tower, it was a little scaffolding in the middle of the soccer field. The Veracruz River of Raptors is extremely important for the monitoring of the complete population of several species of birds. VERACRUZ RIVER OF RAPTORS - A lot on this line. - Roughly? - Some 82,000 for the day. - Uh-huh. Approximately. Yes, there were many broad-wings. We have around 100,000. And then, of course, the environmental, um... uh, education impact, where you have kids and folks like Ángel, and visitors from the United States. Oh, I heard about this place, oh, over 30 years ago... BIRDWATCHER ...when I took a raptor class from a raptor biologist. And, you know, he talked about this place and I've always wanted to come here, and I finally made it. - Yeah, look into this area right here. - I know. It's amazing! You have to look up into the highest parts of the tree. Those birds use both our countries. They need to migrate back and forth. Food to eat, places to live, and places to raise young. It seems like that, right? Can you see them now? Yes. They're going in a straight line. Uh-huh. Now count them. Shall I lend you a clicker so you can count them? Count them. Use the binoculars.

They stay a little longer because they find refuge, they find food. Sometimes they're perching and performing the same daily activities on the same perch, in the same area. BIRD MONITOR AND GUIDE When I went up north, I crossed the border at Piedras Negras but it was through the brush, not exactly the desert. On my way back I used the same route as the raptors, down the Gulf Coast region. And I made it here, that was the good part. It was the same as the birds when they do well. I have my family here, my children, and I've had success here, as a human being. I think birds do the same. They have to return to their perch. ♪ A goldfinch at dawn Sang on a tamarind tree... ♪
