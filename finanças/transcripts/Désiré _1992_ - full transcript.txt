Uterus of Mrs. Jacquinot - June 5th, 2050 - 15:53 Hello. Anyone else feel hot right now? Hey there! WELCOME Hey you! I can't get the countdown to start. Hello, Doctor. Hello. Birth of Désiré Jacquinot, 5th of June 2050. We have time. Put some music on to relax her. Hey! It's a bit loud! - I got a 2-under par, today. - Congratulations Doctor. He's coming. He is here! He is coming! OI! Looking good so far. Mrs. Jacquinot, I am pleased to inform you that everything is going well. Oh, it has started. Mrs. Jacquinot, the Doctor and I are pleased to announce the birth of Désiré. He will be Virgo, ascendant Aquarius, good at windsurfing, real estate investments, fiscal fraud and politics. - His only weakness: women. - Broadcast the announcement. Hello, my name is Désiré, I will soon be born at Block 14 and I hope you will be kind to me. The Doctor likes champagne, thanks in advance! Yes, yes, the champagne is coming... He stayed inside. A late birth in June? Don't worry, there is a slight delay. The Doctor will get him out. Hello! It's nothing, there is a slight delay so...so I will get him out the old-fashioned way. So, um... Push. Push. Push. Push. Good, so, um, instead of being silly I will perform a mesarean. Get me something sharp. So, it's nothing at all, I'm just gonna do a mesarean. It might sting a little at first. So I will do... I will do it latero-external. So I think it's umbili... Yeah, it's umbilical. No, wait, um... I will do an umbilical thing... um... Careful, we need to breathe. - Hello, everyone. - We've had a problem. - What is it? - A woman. - No, the problem. - A late birth. In June?! Wait, maybe there is a way to avoid the measarean... - Can I try something? - Well, the others are waiting... - I won't be long. Hey, little guy. So, taking your time? It's not nice to make us wait like that. If you keep it on, we will send you to the big dragon who will roast you with his flames Because they like hot fetuses, those dragons. And if it's not enough, you know what we'll do? We will come, me and my doctor buddies and we'll beat you with iron poles. And if it's still not enough, I'll graft oysters up your ass. Got it? Come out little guy, release your mother! So? Birth refusal. Birth refusal! What is this bullshit? This is extraordinary, it's very rare. For unknown reasons, the child is afraid. He rejects (...) What the hell are they doing? In the baby's eyes, society is already guilty. It's an extremely rare phenomenon! Don't touch anything! I... I.. will get the press! (background) I'm rich! Welcome to Désiré, the most beautiful of all babies. For him, life will sparkle! Go team newborn! Yes, yes thank you Simon. It will not be necessary this time. - Is there a problem? - No, on the contrary my friend. - What is it? - A great event, huge event. The baby is not normal. Yes! In a way, you could say he's not normal. Is he missing an arm, a leg...? No, he is not missing anything! - He's retarded then? - On the contrary, I would even say he is above average! What's wrong with him then? - Fine, if you have to know it all... - Yes? He refuses to be born! - What is this bullshit? - Huh? One would think I have the professional competence required to make such a hypothesis, mmh? - Think that's funny? - Excuse me? - I said, you think that's funny? - What? Oh yeah? Well I say no. I say this is not fair, you hear me? If someone told me I was gonna be a cripple, I wouldn't have gone out! Oh yeah, you bet I would have stayed comfy! I'd have refused, same as him! Oh come on, you're not a cripple... Not a cripple?! You're kidding me? When I was born, they thought my mother had taken a shit. I can't walk five meters without dropping to the floor! When I was born, they thought my mother had taken a shit. I can't walk five meters without dropping to the floor! - Come on, this is not a big deal... - Not a big deal?! Look at this! See? You can't see it, because the cart is still. Hey! (whispering) My mortar! Come on, there. - This is nothing! - Right, it's nothing! You... you must have slipped! (faking) There, see? I also slipped! I may be a cripple, but I'm not an imbecile. You did it on purpose. I also slipped! I may be a cripple, but I'm not an imbecile. You did it on purpose. Not at all! I actually hurt myself very badly. I don't have balls but as they say, you're starting to bust them! - You looking for a fight? - Calm down, it's a great discovery! Oh yeah? You didn't discover anything for me! Open the door! Open the door! Out with the baby! Out with the baby! (nervous) Nobody will open. - Yeah? Then I'm busting the door! - No! Stop it! Coming, coming! - Simon, you're gonna hurt yourself! - I don't give a shit, I don't feel anything on this side! - Simon, you're gonna hurt yourself! - I don't give a shit, I don't feel anything on this side! Stop this, stop it! - I don't give a shit, I don't feel anything on this side! Stop this, stop it! Open the door, or I'm eating the hostage! [Inaudible] ...please! (chanting) We won, we won! Please! Please! - There must be a reason... - To each his turn. Is he planning to stop refusing any time soon? (cheering) Don't shoot! This is security. Please disperse! There will be no pay raise. We'd rather kill you than raise you wages! It's not a riot, it's because of a baby who refuses to be born! We'd rather kill you than raise you wages! It's not a riot, it's because of a baby who refuses to be born! What is this bullshit? In the baby's eyes, society is already guilty, he refuses it, rejects it. It's called NLI. Non-Life Instinct. Is NLI within regulations? Get a move on! Go tell management! Is NLI within regulations? Get a move on! Go tell management! Stay where you are! Yes? This is Mr. Pisson. From security, yes. So, um.. I have a problem. What's going on? Um, I'm at Block 14... The Birthing Block is... People are protesting because... because... Because what? Because there is a baby who refuses to be born. In the baby's eyes, society is already guilty! What?! But... What is this baloney? I... I... I don't know this baby! What is this baloney? I... I... I don't know this baby! - Oh, no that's not it sir... - (screaming) Listen to me carefully. You will take care of the baby. No please, I beg you. Not a baby... Wait, what is going on? So you're telling me you're a security guard... ...who doesn't want to kill people? Get your act together mate! When someone is refusing to live, it's not a crime to kill them. Regardless, you have no choice. Do it or get fired. Open the door! Yes, we're coming! Everybody out. (hitting her) Calm down. Pardon me, I have to. It might sting a little. Oh, they're gonna bitch about that. What? What is this procedure with the rifle? Great job, you really botched it! So he's normal, we're sure of it...? Hey there! Careful, it's slipping! I didn't hurt you, did I? Oh, look at that funny red liquid. It's coming out of everywhere. That's really peculiar!
