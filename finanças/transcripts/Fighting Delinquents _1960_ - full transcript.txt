With only that mole on his back to go by, it's like searching for a needle in a haystack. Better let the police search for him at reform schools. Why do you think so? His mother is from poor stock. I bet that boy Sadao grew up to be a punk. Shut up, Kanjuro! Sadao is the only heir of the Matsudaira clan. How dare you speak of him like that? Always address him as 'Young Master.' It worries me so. Not you, silly. I'm worried about Sadao, my grandson. Bastard! Hey, Sanpei! The boss got run over by a car. Shige, the boss is badly injured in a car accident. Miyo, something terrible's happened! What? Father died? RAINBOW ART COMPANY BILLBOARDS AND DECORATION Doing it for free is no excuse to skip prayers. I don't know the rest yet. Fool. Call yourself a priest? Never mind. It's the thought that counts. I'm sure dad is happy. Miyo... I'll make us tea. Sadao, what are we to do? That's obvious. We must take care of Miyo. I'll follow in his footsteps. Without him, we're all orphans again. Let's work hard to make his firm a success. Right, get to work. Buddha will be pleased. Welcome, sir. - Is this the Soma residence? - Yes. I offer my condolences. Allow me to pay my respect. - Please, go ahead. Such a good man. What a waste. He just had bad luck. Please resign yourself to the idea. That's best for all. Who are you anyway? I forgot to say I'm here on behalf of the director. FAR EAST TOURISM LIABILITIES MANAGER - Liabilities Manager? - Yes. Though the accident was not his fault... ...my boss understands your grief and sends you a token of his sympathy. His condolence gift may seem small, but it's the thought that counts. I trust this way we can settle things amicably. Hey, mate! Think you can buy off murder with a lousy 30,000 yen? The way you put it... Don't act innocent. Your boss is to blame. Don't be rude. You fool. Get lost, asshole! - What do you want? - That you show up to apologize. - My manager went. - He tried to fob me off with 30,000 yen. - How much? - One million yen. One million? You must be kidding. Not in a million years. Put yourself in Miyo's place. How is she to survive? Hello, Odaira... We say we'll build an amusement centre. My real plans? To build Asia's Monaco on Awaji island. Did you buy up that hot spa yet? Idiot! What's taking you so long? I sent you to Awaji six months ago. Who? Mizoguchi Kanjuro? The guy who got us the nightclub. Hey, mister... You must buy that spa this year. Expect me there soon. - What's this? - Your travel fare. What? You convince the daughter to take my offer. Now get lost. - Stop it! - You got it all wrong. I can't be bought off that cheap. Stop it, you punk. Please stop that. Don't interfere. This cheat deserves a good beating. I'll call the police. Go ahead. They'll prove me right. Please stop now. He's still only a boy. - Get lost! - Time to leave, punk! "Orphaned Teenage Punk Pockets 1 Million Yen Damages" "One Million Yen!" What's that guy up to? - This charm proves it. - Hey, mister! There's no money. Young master! I have found you at last. You are the young master of the Awaji-Matsudaira clan. Poor joke, you sneaky thief. It must be you. The mole on your back shaped like Awaji proves it. You also carry this charm. It clearly bears the blue Tokugawa emblem. Your grandmother, lady Ikuyo, gave this to you, young master. Young master! Beware, you'll catch a cold. Allow me to introduce myself properly. Lord Ryuichiro, the 62nd heir of the Matsudaira clan... ...passed away six months ago. He was your father, young master. - You're joking. - Please hear me out. Only lady Ikuyo is left, widow of the 61st heir and mother of Ryuichiro. Your father lived apart from your mother and remained alone the rest of his life. Without an heir, the clan was in danger of dying out. We called together a family council to appoint an outsider as new heir. Suddenly, lady Ikuyo declared: I remember now that I have one grandson. Ryuichiro had this fling with a waitress who bore him a son. To avoid a scandal I forced them to separate. The woman and her son also lived apart. He must be alive somewhere. I want you to find him at any cost. You are the boy in question, young master. You are the spitting image of your father. Isn't that something? Our bro' here is a lord. Blood will out, I guess. I always sensed a dignified air about him. But it will be lonely without Sadao around. I'm not going anywhere. Back home your family is waiting for you. Better get out of this filthy place now. Old man, sorry we didn't clean up for you. Sorry for being so forward. Just try and say it again, old man. Shut up or we'll throw you out. I don't care who gave me this charm. Please don't. We all pulled through together. I won't leave them now. Tell that to the old lady. But Sadao, you'll get to meet your mother. Better meet the mother who put you into this world. My mum... Never imagined I had one too. Is she alive? Of course. Your mother was reconciled with lady Ikuyo and is part of the family. She is the one most eagerly awaiting you, young master. Forget it. I don't need a mother. Don't worry about us. You helped us get a million yen. We can get by on our own. Sadao... Be a man, bro! If it were me, I'd be gone already. Me too, I'd pack up and leave. Shut up. I can't go alone. No good. Let's throw him out. Take a last look at your old home. Let's put some spirit into it. Soon the dawn of the New Year will be upon us marked by the Emperor's grand festivities Young master, in future a bridge will stretch between Honshu and Awaji island. It will make our island more accessible. Tell me, which way is Tokyo? In that direction. Soon the dawn of the New Year will be upon us marked by the Emperor's grand festivities Young master! That's my daughter. She attends to lady Ikuyo's needs. I'm Kazuko. How do you do? Nice to meet you. That is your great-uncle, young master. I'm Mizoguchi Kanjuro, your grandma's brother. Just call me if you're in trouble. What's keeping the young master? Old man... Where's my mum? Pay your respect first. Never mind that. Izeki, thank you for your perseverance. Are you sure he is our Sadao? For certain, so I swear by all that is sacred. Before I present him to our clan members, I wish to see absolute proof. Come closer. This charm is without doubt of the Awaji Matsudaira clan. It's the one you gave him when he was fostered out as a baby. How about the mole? - I witnessed it at the bathhouse. - Let him show us. I won't believe you until I see it with my own eyes. As you wish. Young master, please... - Do as lady Ikuyo tells you. - I won't. If you are really my grandson, you would show me. Don't nag, you old hag. You dragged me here just to undress, did you? Better to have left me where I was. Stop insulting your grandmother. Shut up. He must be a fake. Wait, I'm sure he can show us. He has nothing to show. If you're so curious, look till they pop out. Sadao, you are my grandson. Listen granny, or lady or whatever, you get under my skin badly. I refuse to pass for your grandson. - Wait, Sadao! - Young master... I hate this gloomy place. And where's mummy? 'Mummy? ' Bunch of liars. I came all the way to meet her. That is your mistake. Your mother is nowhere near here. Say what? Izeki, did you tell him that sordid lie? That won't do. You've deceived my precious grandson. Shyster, you're a disgrace! Please, have mercy. I tolerate no contradiction. Get out of my sight. Granny, stop spouting like those samurai films. 'Spouting?' The old man didn't mean no harm. You had him cornered, so he lied his way out. Am I right? Young master... Forgive him, granny. Stop saying 'granny' and be quiet. Be quiet, Kanjuro. But sister, we can't tolerate such abuse. - Very true. - He has no manners. Quiet everybody. Sadao is clearly an unpretentious boy. He's not just stubborn, but also speaks up for others. That proves he must be of true Matsudaira stock. Don't let him get away. We need him. Don't judge me too soon I'll make my own way in this world Just wait and see Us lot are pure-hearted punks Still, I wonder why Why my heart should feel so sad I'm a drifter from the Kanto Look, the Naruto Strait. The whirlpools are impressive. Show me the restaurant where my mum was born. Why? She's no longer there. I just want to. - Now I get it. - What's that? Why you can live in that gloomy house. To find your mother, isn't it? This must be where she was born. So now it's a nightclub. Quite a change. Hey, missus! Funny to run into you here. Why are you here? Just on a short trip. Actually, so am I. Sorry about kicking up a row. I lost my senses that day. Don't apologize. You had every right. See you around. Bye. Are you sure we can acquire the spa grounds? As the only male heir of the Matsudaira clan, the matter is at my discretion. - They say the young master is back. - But he's only a kid. Nothing is decided without me. We are counting on you. Consider it travel fare. I see. Thank you. Mr. Mizoguchi, I hear you're a building contractor. Arrange the sale and the building contract is yours. Thank you, sir. So that's how you knew her. Better stay clear of them. - Why? - They cheated the owner out of that building. - Now they want the Matsudaira villa. - What villa? - Here is the source of the hot spring. - The source? All the inns draw from it for free. So Far East Tourism is up to something. They're after this. There's more property. It's beautiful out here. In December daffodils bloom all around. Great for a recreation park. That's what they want too. But I would open it to all children, for free. - For free? - Right. For kids in cramped cities with no room to play. But it won't work. I'm broke. That kid is the Matsudaira heir. Doesn't look like he'd bother us. We can't afford to be so careless. Better stay clear of them. They want the daffodil park. I plan to build the Monaco of Asia on Awaji island. I won't allow it. We'll never sell our property. But the villa is useless. And Sadao is still too young. Always call him 'young master'. So the young master is still young. I won't have it. If you sell now and buy shares, you'll have a nice nest egg for the future. This is what I think, Kanjuro. The villa, the hills and the daffodil park were entrusted to us by our ancestors. Insulting to dispose of it with one stroke of the pen. But taxes eat up our wealth, so... I can't bear it any longer! Not you, fool. That crazy music drives me mad. Let's dance, granny. - What? - Same as your drum beating. How dare you? The souls of all 62 ancestors in this house are shaken to their core. - What are you doing? - The young master ordered us. Look at the mess you made of this room. Full with bloody foreign stuff. It's the funky touch. Whatever they call it, I won't have you drag it in here. You undo it now! Where are you going? You get on my nerves. Sadao, wait. I'm out of here. I'll tolerate anything you do or say, but please don't go. Please stay, I beg you. You serious? Always am. Sadao... - Had enough? - No, I mean something else. I heard you went by your mother's house. Surely she must hate me. She doesn't mince words. But it's not your fault. This house is to blame. The house? Old-fashioned family ways. See, granny, they tied you down. You're such a clever boy. But I want to do more than just relieve your stress. What? What did you just say? I want to liven up this house. For your sake, too. Don't bother. Having you around satisfies me. But spare me the foreign stuff. Granny, come on. Don't spoil it. Will you grant me one favour? Believe me, it will help the Matsudaira clan. - Are you serious? - Always am. Promise you won't threaten to leave anymore? I promise. All right then. Just one favour. You're worth a bonus, granny. MIZOGUCHI BUILDERS Uncle, I'm selling the Matsudaira hills. Stop joking. Grandma would never allow it. She gave her consent. She really did! Why are you selling? I need money. I can't believe she signed. Why do you need money? That's a secret. Help me sell it, or I'll go elsewhere. You could easily get 30 million yen. Thirty million? Okay. Set me up with a buyer. You're on. I feel that great things are going to happen. 32 million is cheap. I told her we need it to renovate the house. You did well. To convince that kid was the hardest. He gave me a rough time. Watch out. I'm sorry. - Pervert. - You're quite depraved yourself. You creep! So we got our hands on the hill designated for the observatory. Next we need the hot spring source and the amusement park area. That would really put us in business. Make sure that kid warms to our plans. Leave him to me. Sir, your car has arrived. I'll introduce you to my secretary. Enjoy yourself. Let's sing and dance and kiss Let's have lots of fun and kiss When you hold me I may seem petite But I'm a grown-up just like you I had a husky voice all my life I am the, I am the... I am the Little Transistor Chick I recognized you, Yuki. So you're his secretary? - And you schemed for the land, uncle. - What's that to you? No need to keep secrets from me. Because I'm Nanjo's secretary now. - Don't you know? - What? That your boy rejoined the Matsudaira clan. Sadao did? He led a tough life back in Tokyo. I'll set up a secret meeting, if you look after my interests too. - Why should I meet him? - Because... I parted with Sadao long ago. We are no longer mother and son. It feels like I never had a son. I wonder. Listen, uncle. You know, don't you? That Nanjo is taking care of me. So I beg you, uncle... ...never to mention Sadao again. Specially not to Nanjo. Let's sip trendy coffee and kiss Let's sit in the cinema and kiss Even though I'm from glamorous Ginza I still get shy, I do get shy When everyone calls me by that name I am the, I am the... I am the Little Transistor Chick MATSUDAIRA VILLA REVAMP YOUTH HOSTEL BUILDING SITE Who told you to mess with the Matsudaira villa? I did. Sa... I mean, young master. The land sale allows us to renovate. This'll be a hotel. That's outrageous. Below! Sister, no true member of the Matsudaira clan would run a hotel for foreigners. - Think of our reputation. - That boy has deceived you. I granted him a favour. Now stop interfering in my grandson's affairs. How can you put up with living in these strange quarters? I can bear it as long as it helps the clan. If I antagonize him, we'll lose our only heir. There are plenty of other candidates. Shut up! Only a man with pure Matsudaira blood can be true heir to the clan. Not bastards like you. Kanjuro, how about it? Why not redecorate your place in Western style? Think of the benefits. You could have meals in bed, like me. - It took me by surprise. - Stop lying. You conspired with them to squeeze money out of me. No, you're wrong. That bloody kid saw through our game. Odaira, your laziness got us into this mess. - I see. - Don't 'I see' me! Let's deal with that punk now! The moon peeps through the simple roof And through the lattice can be seen Takechi Mitsuhide Let's stop that punk! Look, Sadao. YOUTH HOSTEL OPENS ON AWAJI ISLAND Then one, whose countless wounds pour blood like waterfalls Comes leaning on his sword, stumbling as he goes Returning is Takechi's son, who gulps the garden air. "Father, you are here!" He speaks in mortal pain, facing his dying hour His mother looks in shock, as his betrothed Hatsugiku runs to his side "Oh, my poor Jujiro. While we waited for you, your grandmother has suffered a cruel fate Please stay awake" Moaning, moaning his betrothed Hatsugiku holds him close And gently looks after him, Crying all the while "We drove the enemy into a corner Fighting desperately When a strong voice Suddenly shouted from the rear" Young master! "It was the loyal retainer of Mashiba Chikuzen and thus our enemy There stood Kato Masakiyo who insulted me and said:- 'You son of Takechi the traitor! I'll teach you a lesson!" Say, have you seen a kid in a brown sweater? What? That way? "Then he slashed away in all directions And in a flash, all our men lay dead or dying" You let him get away? He's terribly fast. We'll get him tomorrow. You idiot! Now that he knows, you won't surprise him a second time. We must wait and strike on the day of the opening. My grandson, Sadao. The village mayor. Pleased to meet you. You did a fine job. Awaji lacked recreational facilities for the young. My grandson has a sharp eye for these things. You look younger yourself. I do my best to keep up with the youngsters. Hey, uncle... Drink to the occasion. Young squire. You're still on vacation? Uh, I want to ask your help. It sounds silly for my age, but I've eloped with a woman. - Eloped? - Yes, but... I ran out of money and she went off with some young brat. I'm devastated. What can I do? I can't go back to Tokyo. Please give me a job here. - Please, young squire. - You're hired. Welcome. Hello. So we meet again. I'm glad you came. This is my party. That means you are Sadao. You're right. I am Sadao. And you're a friend of my grandmother? That's right, isn't it? Yes... A long time ago. Please, have a drink. Young master, time for your speech. See you later. Hello, Yuki. I thought you'd come. I wish I hadn't. To be honest, I didn't build this hotel for the Matsudaira clan. I was hoping that my mother would hear about it and come to see me. Even grandma feels sorry for her. If my mum steps forward now... ...we gladly take her into the family. Right, grandma? Yes, we would. That's why I need your help. I don't know her face. But some of you must know her. So if you see her, please tell her that I'm trying to find her. And that I don't blame her for abandoning me. I beg you. Hey, bro! No need to cry. You read my letter? What? We didn't get any letter. - Your invitation. - Right... We got all worried cause we didn't hear a thing from you. - So we decided... - To rush over. Good you came. - You okay, bro? - Why? - You turned all fancy. - Skip it! We go way back, don't we? You'll be my first hotel guests. You too, Kazuko? Even if they say you serve your country No man really likes to join the army It feels terrible to be conscripted Still worse is shedding tears when parting from my dear girlfriend No time left to eat that sweet bun Now that they sound the taps I lie atop the straw mattress in my cramped 5 feet long bunk This is the bed we dreamed of. Lady Ikuyo, don't allow them to go on. Grandmother, put a stop to this! Fire! Sadao! It's you. Put it out. Help me! Young master, this is a plot. This was planned by arsonists with an eye on the Matsudaira fortune. - Guys from Nightclub Joker. - Excuse me? I saw their faces. Hey, Izeki. Wait up! Let me go. Please, let me go. - Where to? - The police. Then leave that dagger here. But I fear for your life, young master. We can only report arson. I'll deal with those thugs myself. We arrived right on time. Didn't we, Sanpei? Keep this a secret. Will you, Izeki? That I fell from the stairs, too. That's the spirit. - But, young master... - You think of ignoring my orders, Izeki? Don't tell grandma about this. I know you sold for 32 million. Why squander 2 million profit like this? Bring me sake. I didn't mean any harm when I took that kickback. - Did you sell to Odaira of Nightclub Joker? - Well, uh... Tell her to leave us alone. You did it on purpose. I'm sorry. I saw an opportunity to make money. Only to squander it here? Boss Nanjo plans an amusement centre. I know that! Luckily I beat them to it. Those thugs have no right to this island. But now boss Nanjo is on my back and I'm in a fix. Damn those bastards! - There's another thing I kept from you. - What is it? Promise me you won't tell your grandma. I never snitch. - You sure? - Hurry up and tell me. You see, the big boss's woman... ...is really your mother. - Really? - She came to the party. That woman from Tokyo, she's the one. Don't snitch on me to your grandma. What do you want? I'm not the kind of woman you think. But you're still my mother. Why didn't you say? I want to see you, like I said last night. That's no lie, it's the truth. - What is it? - Boss wants to see those accounts again. Mother... Strange... Even if you call me that, it doesn't feel like I'm your mother. Then why did you help me? Just a coincidence. I happened to be there. But you belong to them. You knew in advance. You knew, so you saved me. I don't blame you for anything. You must have had your reasons. Let's go back home together. That's impossible. As long as you want it, anything is possible, mother. If granny objects, I'm out of there. You don't have to work. I'll make a living for both of us. Dear Sadao... Let's go now. I'm in love with Nanjo. Save your breath, because its pointless. Now go back, please. Don't you realize she abandoned you? Why on earth did you want to see her? The nerve she has turning up here on the arm of a yakuza. You dare call that a mother? Forget about her. Don't you realize how much I love you? Did I ever cut you short if you asked me a favour? It's your fault. What? You threw my mother out. - Sadao! - You forced her to become like that. Fussing about blood ties. You can't even make someone happy, old hag. Get out! If you like your mother that much... ...then stay with her. I'm going! You're no longer my grandson! Who would want to be? I don't, anyhow. Sadao! Lady Ikuyo. Please wear these. - Don't go. - Leave me alone. You told me to leave. You're too old to chase after me. Please don't leave the house. Don't put on your sad face. I was wrong. Don't you see? I came to apologize. So, I can bring my mother over? I'm not sure if... Don't run away. Can she come? Okay, if you must. Thank you, grandma. I'll carry you home. You're such a fickle boy. I was only holding back to be with my mother. But I won't leave you now that mother comes. That's a promise. - Really? - You know how I hate lies and insults. Tomorrow I'll go over to meet with Yuki. You will? Yuki will have things to settle, but I'll urge her to join us as soon as possible. You're so understanding, grandma. I do it all for your sake. I wonder if Yuki is here? Tell her Matsudaira is here. It's been a while. I'm glad you look well. Honestly? All this trouble makes me grow thin with worry. Listen, Yuki... Will this do... ...to make you disappear? But mother... Do it for Sadao. You see, Yuki... I want him to be the next head of the Matsudaira clan. At first I had to indulge his whims. But gradually... ...living together under the same roof... ...I became fond of him. By now I feel obliged to make him happy. That's all I can think of now. As long as he's happy, I have no further needs. Shouldn't this amount be enough, I'd gladly hand over my property. However much it takes for you to go away. How about it, Yuki? I'm sure you see no point in becoming Sadao's mother again. Do me this favour and move to somewhere else. I understand. So you will? On one condition. Tell me. You hand over the hotel and the park area to us. All right. My lawyer will contact you. We'll be waiting for him. Goodbye. That was perfect. This will make the boss happy. Yuki, you handled it great. Wait for me! Wait for me! This'll be the park. - You've got the cash? - Still 15 million left. - Enough for a monkey train. - Brilliant idea. I'll invest one million. - All agreed? - Let's do it. I disagree! Why? I'd rather be a bellboy. I'll work my butt off for granny and mum. Grandma... Tell me about it. You met my mother, right? Sadao... You have to let her go. I made her the proposition I had promised you. Guess what she answered. "Hand over the hotel and the park, and I'll pack up and leave forever." That's a lie. I can't believe it. Your mother always was a silly woman. She favours money over her own son. She's not like that! I never lie. Izeki went over there with the deed. With this we'll get 10 times the planned profits. Well... Please make the receipt official. Time to leave. The bus has arrived. Madam, your seal please. Mother... Tell me truth. This is not your idea, right? Nanjo made you do it, didn't he? Don't you care about me? But you do care, don't you? They can have all this, as long as we're together again. Dear Sadao... I'm low-class. I can never belong to the Matsudaira clan. Women like me end up with men like Nanjo. Class difference is old-fashioned. Come with me. You'll be head of the Matsudaira clan, so stop calling me 'mother.' Wait! Maybe my grandma agreed, but as heir of the Matsudaira clan I refuse. You're not my mother anymore. Izeki... What if I let him go? We'll charge him with larceny and attempted dispossession. I'll get you for this, punk! The kid's a tough brat. But he's only 17. Use your bloody wits. You too, Mizoguchi. You're the old hag's confidant, so think of something. If the punk builds his own park, we're done for. I can pack it in. Mizoguchi... - Tomorrow's the Awaji festival, right? - Yes... Now we can start building in the park. - Yeah, right after the festival. - Hold on! Sister... Sister. Sister... Is that you, Kanjuro? Please pour me one, Mr. Izeki. Uncle! What are you doing? Where did grandma go? No idea. Don't kid me. What are you looking for? "Come to Mt. Hakudo alone - Bring deed and seal in exchange for your grandmother." Uncle! I know nothing. Nanjo ordered me to. Forgive me. I beg you on my knees, see? Please Sadao, don't go. Shut up! I love my grandma. She always loved me. I must save her. Let me through! Don't go soft on me now. I thought you loved me. But Sadao means more to me. Yuki! I'm breaking up with you. Your methods are too harsh for such a boy. Let me talk to him once more. Give us the deed and the seal. REGISTERED PROPERTY OF MATSUDAIRA IKUYO Let her mount the horse. Don't worry, grandma. Wait, Sadao! Now it's your turn. Sadao! Listen punk, hand me the deed if you want them alive. Sadao, the Matsudaira property is all yours. Do as you please with it. Shut up! Mother... You don't care if they live or die? The seal, too. Bro, you all right? Sadao! No, come back! The current will drag you down! - They sing that we must dance. - Let's go then. They're so young and cheerful. Mother... Sadao... Your mother is going back to Tokyo. I tried to stop her, honestly. She said she can't face you anymore. So... she doesn't understand how I feel. Sadao, it's still not too late. Bring Yuki back. You're the only who can. Grandma... Mother... Sadao, sweet boy. I'll never let go again. Whatever they say, you'll always be my mother. Let's go back. Grandma is waiting. THE END Subtitles: Geert van Bremen (OCR errors corrected: TLG)
