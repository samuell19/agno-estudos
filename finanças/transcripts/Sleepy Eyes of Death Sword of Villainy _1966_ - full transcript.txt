Somebody, please help! The biggest oil merchant in Edo, Yahiko-ya, was robbed by a professional thief in the daytime. That was big news! The police chief happened to be in the neighborhood, and rushed into the store! Oh, thank you for coming. Who was it? Did he run away? Well, nobody saw him. Close the main gate! Watch the hallway! Close the back gate, too! What about the warehouse and the cellar? The inner warehouse is fine. Nobody went there. Master's youngest daughter is in the front of it, playing hide and seek with her friends. Well, if he isn't here, then? We keep all the oil barrels from Osaka at the outside warehouse. How about there? Take me there! "Kojimachi, Akasaka... Akasaka no..." - Are you ready? - Not yet. "Soon, Ochanomiya" "It's time for lunch at Ochanomiya" "I'll buy you a drink" - Are you ready? - Not yet. Are you ready? Are you ready? Yes, I'm ready. I'm ready. I found the devil in hide and seek! Oh, you've found me. I give up. I give up. Now, Uncle, you be the devil. Yes, yes. I'll be a scary devil who eats up the whole Yahiko-ya. However, this devil has a soul. I don't want to kill innocent people. Besides, I have accomplished my purpose for today. Yahiko-ya, I'll take this. This used to belong to us. And you, if you care about your child's life, don't say anything until after everybody leaves. Let's go upstairs. And bring the toys with you. Yes! I'll teach you a new song. The beginning of the story is: A samurai came to sell Yahiko-ya a very famous and expensive tea cup called Ichimonji. The daughter of the master was going to get married to another big merchant also named Ichimonji. Yahiko-ya thought it would bring great luck to add the famous tea cup to her bridal furniture set. However, the samurai set the price too high. The negotiations seemed to end right there. Suddenly, the samurai drew his sword. Well, the samurai tied them all up and went to the inner warehouse as if he had planned it in advance. Then... "How much will it be to get in the palanquin?" "How about 500?" "How about a little lower?" Uncle! Let's play together! Yes, yes. Then play hide and seek with me. We'll decide who'll be the devil. What a surprise. She said to him, "Uncle, let's play!" Even though she had never met him before. He was a total stranger to her, you know. What a brave girl she was! What a nice line. - "Uncle, let's play!" - Tetsu. How did you get this whole story? Oh, come on. I'm a well-known hairstylist in that neighborhood. I see. I guess Yahiko-ya let you do your work at the inner warehouse. How rude you are! Actually, you're right. I was hiding in the inner warehouse first because I wanted to steal something from there. Then, suddenly the samurai came in with the girl to play hide and seek. I almost had a heart attack! What was he looking for? He was looking for something like contract documents, accounting records, or blue prints. What were you looking for? I spotted some merchandise delivered from Echigo, specifically from Yahiko, which is the store owner's home town. So I guessed that it was the famous sake from that region called Enmei-shu. I stole one container and hid it inside my tool box. How did you escape from the warehouse? Since his granddaughter was a hostage, Yahiko-ya couldn't do anything. I used that panic situation as a chance to escape from the warehouse. Well, I want to taste this special sake with you. Hey, can I have a hammer and a wooden cup for sake? People say that if you drink a cup of this sake you'll extend your life by a year. What great sake. Enmei-shu! Ugh! Damn! What is it? What a foul smell! Spoiled? Or I don't know what. It's out! What a surprise! You can't put it out with water because it runs on top of the water and spreads. That's why we have to put it out with our feet. We call it fukusozui or kusamizu, and it comes out of the ground in Echigo. It's just like oil. Miss, are you from Echigo? Oh no, no. I knew because my friends from Echigo told me about it. - Friends? - Yes. "The Street Performers from Echigo". Attention! Thank you very much. Good day. There was a man behind the screen. He was hiding himself there. The man who ignited the fukusozui. Was he a samurai? He seemed like a ronin. So what? I just saw him for a second, but I thought he was Kakunosuke-sama. So I wanted to check for myself. That's why I jumped in the restaurant to put out the fire. But he never showed his face from the screen again. It's impossible. Impossible that he could have survived. Kakunosuke-sama, whom I met in Osaka, had been badly burned by fire. I cannot be sure it was his head on display. I can't get the idea out of my head that Kakunosuke-sama somehow survived and is living somewhere here in Edo. Yes. He was following us from the restaurant. Are there any rich people in this neighborhood who can afford a hairstylist? Damn! Who are you? Attention! This is evidence. Yahiko-ya stole these very secret plans which had been made by the Senshindo. From these designs, Yahiko-ya has already started refining oil from Fukusozu in Echigo for commercial use. Well, what did you request from Yahiko-ya? At first, 100,000 ryo. 100,000 ryo? In cash? Can he afford it? He was the one who brought the proposal that for our project of refining oil from Fukusozu he pay a 100,000 ryo premium. However, now I know he won't pay a penny. So that's why I want to blackmail him. Of course, I don't care if he pays or not. I just want to push him to the edge. I want him to suffer! Yes. After all, I'm going to kill him anyway. Since we've got the evidence. To keep it simple, let's kill him right now! Yes, kill him! It's too easy! The research of Jusai-sama, our great teacher, was destroyed by others besides Yahiko-ya, was it not? Yes, of course! All of the big Osaka merchants who promised to support our cause to aid the poor, then backed out on their promises. Konoike Zeiemon to begin with. Mitsui Hachisoemon, Tenma-ya Gohei! Uchida Sobei, Yone-ya Heiemon, 24 others! Merchants. Any others? Of course! Our petition for aid to the poor was crushed in his hand as if it were trash by the East Magistrate Officer Atobe Yamashiro. Then what did Atobe Yamashiro do? He asked for orders from higher ranking officers in the East Magistrate's office. That's what people thought! The truth is Atobe Yamashiro was under the direction of his brother, Mizuno Tadakuni. Mizuno, one of the senior councilors to the Shogun, is Atobe's brother? Not many people know. Atobe is actually a puppet who's controlled by his brother Mizuno Tadakuni, one of the Shogun's senior councilors. Therefore, never forget who actually destroyed our great teacher Jusai's project and put him to a tragic death! Never forget his name! Our ultimate goal is...! Shima-san? Finally, Yahiko-ya makes a move. I heard that Yahiko-ya secretly ordered bodyguards from the dojo Kusakabe Genshin School of the Sword. How about you? I'm a new student. So I'm not included as a part of it. Then, do you know anything about the order? We can't make a plan if we don't have any information! What are we going to do? What shall we do? We can't just wait here for them to show up. For them to show up? Here? Yes. This is a secret hideout. How would they find out about it? Why don't you ask Shima? No. Never... They asked you, didn't they? Why don't you ask Shima's body? I see. You told them after being tortured. Damn you! Since they found out about our hideout, where is the best place for us to go? What good timing! There are two vacant rooms at a tenement house. One is vacant because the old tenant died there. The other is vacant because the former tenants ran away. Besides, they're very close to Ichimonji-ya. I'm so sorry, Sir. Kusakabe Genshin School of the Sword Aizen and the others have gone somewhere. But Shima did not come out of the ship. I thought it was a bit strange, so I went inside the ship to check. "Take him back since he is a student of yours." What the hell are you doing? What a terrible thing I did! Please forgive me, please. Hey, you! Come up here! And get down on your knees! Komura, you're the one who should have avoided it. If it was a kusarigama, half of your head would already be gone. Well, it was my mistake. I'm so sorry. - Oh, our teacher! - Kakunosuke-sama! Kakunosuke-sama! - "Oh, our teacher!" - "Kakunosuke-sama!" "Kakunosuke-sama!" I see! He was Kakunosuke! The one who was in Osaka. If Kakunosuke was the son of Oshio Heihachiro... Then, calling me, "Our teacher", "Kakunosuke-sama"... Those men, that woman, who are they? What are you studying? Oh, Sir. When we had the Oshio Heihachiro Affair, Atobe Yamashiro-dono was in the East Magistrate's office, wasn't he? Correct. Mizuno Esshu, is Atobe Yamashiro your brother? Yes, that's right. What about it? There's someone who wants to see you right away. The men in the ship found an odd place to hide. Well... "Attention!" The street performers live there too. That means they live very close to Ichimonji-ya. Let's go! Let's go! Hey! I don't know who they are, but I guess they're after Yahiko-ya. Are they thieves? They can't be. But we have our job to do before they move. Please stop singing the song that man taught you. He's a criminal! He is not a criminal! He promised next time he'll bring me a beautiful gift! Don't trust him. He's a terrible person! He will, he will. If he doesn't, he'll be punished! "Promise, promise" "If you break it, your ten fingers" "Will rot and fall off" He'll come. I don't want to see Uncle lose his ten fingers! - What did he promise to bring you? - Well... I can't say! Until the moment, I promised not to say a word! Otherwise my fingers will rot. Oh, a terrible thing! Where is Ichimonji-ya? With Father. I copied the illustration and document myself. So they're quite accurate. I'm pretty sure of it. If there are any mistakes, it would have to be in the processing equipment. No matter what we tried, we couldn't eliminate the black smoke. I must find out the petroleum refining process from the Dutch in Nagasaki. Or we can't sell this stuff as commercial oil. We'll do it! We'll keep doing it until we change all petroleum in the country into pure oil. This is a big business! I swore on my soul that we'd close the door on the tragic Oshio Incident. I was a part of that incident. Because of it, I can't sleep well at night. That's why I'll give you my daughter and let you handle my main business. I really appreciate that. So please let me go to Nagasaki. No. We can't make any moves. - Why is that? - Because it's dangerous. The Oshio survivors are tough, and I know they won't just take money and go away. - Besides, I'm worried about... - What? Is there something else? Well, I heard that Kakunosuke, who is supposed to be dead, is hiding somewhere in Edo. Furthermore, somebody saw Kakunosuke. It can't be true. Well... It's possible if the dead body they recovered was somebody else's, and was so badly burned that it couldn't be identified well. Father! He's the one who saw Kakunosuke. I made pictures of Kakunosuke to give out to my bodyguards for the search. Excuse me. - Could your name be Oshio... - Are you asking if I'm Kakunosuke? It depends on who's asking! Be serious! Who are you? You should introduce yourself properly if you want to know somebody's name! Alright, then! I'm asking you with a sword! If you draw your sword, then I'll do the same. Prepare yourself! Damn. Withdraw! Withdraw! Kyoshiro! I need to talk to you. A wastrel? Yes, I'm a wastrel as you say. I can't stand authority. It's for our country! It's for our country that we need your help in bringing justice. How could you do nothing if you know the Oshio survivors plan to revolt? I know nothing about it. I don't know any details of it. Don't tell me you don't know anything. Weren't you at Mizuno Esshu-sama's library the other day doing research about the Oshio Heihachiro Affair? That's right. The Oshio Affair was the result of bad government policies and mishandling of the public by politicians. I believe responsibility for the whole incident lies with - Roju Mizuno Echizen-no-Kami... - Stop! As you wish, Sir. I'll ask you again. Can you accept my request? If there is a revolt, it will be Echizen-no-Kami's own fault. He should deal with it himself. He's an Elder on the Roju. He doesn't need this villain's skill at the sword to protect him. Come. If... If you change your mind... Kid! Come out! I'll walk you home. Whatever your intentions. Whatever your plans. You shouldn't use a little kid like him as a spy. If you interfere too much, you might get hurt. Please tell them that. - Understand? - Yes! How kind of you. For walking this child home to his tenement house, as a member of the community, I want to thank you. You're welcome. Forgive me for asking, are you Nemuri Kyoshiro-dono? I saw you at the bridge the other night and observed your Full Moon Style. I was very impressed. Thank you very much. However, since you're a friend of Roju Mizuno Esshu's Chief Retainer, you might not be on our side. Perhaps. Perhaps not. Well, in the near future, we'll find out. Excuse me. Kyoshiro is on our enemy's side and I assume you're on our side. I don't know why you're here, but if you need help, I'll give it to you. "If you interfere too much, you'll get hurt." Don't bother us too much, otherwise we'll kill you right away. If it makes you feel better to confess to someone, then I'll listen to you. However, you should know that I'm not a moral person. You can trust me on this, because I, myself, am telling you. Kakunosuke-sama had an idea about fukusozui in Echigo. He was searching for a process to refine fukusozui into commercial oil. Since fukusozui comes out of the ground naturally, it would make huge profits if he could successfully refine it. And he thought he could use the money for his cause. Then Yahiko-ya, who is from Echigo, proposed to back all of Kakunosuke's projects. No. Yahiko-ya wanted to steal our master's project. He just pretended to be Kakunosuke's sponsor. What? They made me spy on Kakunosuke-san. Spy? It was when Kakunosuke-sama came to our village in Echigo to research fukusozui. I became a guide and his assistant at that time. Then Kakunosuke-sama asked me to be his assistant in Osaka for research into refining fukusozui into commercial oil. So I went with him to Osaka. Young Master! I'm stupid! Stupid! You fell in love with Kakunosuke, didn't you? No, never. Not at all! I'm a street performer. Homeless from the day I was born. Our class levels were totally different. Class level is class level. Love is love. I see. Then Yahiko-ya used your emotions for his benefit. After all, I'm the one who's stupid. Yahiko-ya's nephew, Ichimonji-ya Minokichi, and I grew up in the same neighborhood in our home town. Minokichi told me that he loved me. I see. I was so flattered by his sweet talk because I had never expected anything like that in my life. Please understand me. I understand well. Then, I did awful things to Kakunosuke-sama, such as stealing his research documents and equipment, as I was told to do by Minokichi. After everything you did for him, he left you. Yes. Minokichi got a lot of credit for what you stole from Kakunosuke and he got a branch of Yahiko-ya's family. Besides, he'll marry Yahiko-ya's daughter. That's why you're here. To kill Minokichi. Yes. But, how are you going to kill him, with your gentle hands? I'll do anything. If I can get close to him, then... What? Let's go! Hey! Did you see? Kyoshiro! I'll kill you. - Let's fight! - Woman! Prepare! I don't know who my mother is! But some woman gave birth to me for sure! That's why I can't stand for anyone trying to hurt a woman who is just like my mother! I also can't stand anyone who tries to hurt my neighbor. I'll take care of the rest. Is that the palanquin? Yes. I'm sure it's Ichimonji-ya. Your enemy Minokichi is right there! Where is he going? He was probably summoned by Yahiko-ya, because I see one of Yahiko-ya's clerks. Only one clerk. Wait! It's not the right time yet. Let me see your hand. My hand? Oh, we've almost the same hands. I don't know who my mother is. But I was told by someone who knew my mother that we have almost exactly the same hands. If my hand and yours are the same, then your hands are the same as my mother's. Your mother's hands? I don't want any blood on your hands. I understand how much you hate him for what he did to you. However, a woman like you should not have blood on her hands. When the right time comes, the right person will kill him. Are you talking about Aizen's people? No. Then are you the one? No. Then who will do it? Heaven. Heaven? By a person who was ordered to do so by Heaven, and at the time when he is told to do it. Then, when will that be? When? Well... Today is... The Rat. The Ox. The Tiger. The Hare. I see. What? I see. The Ram. The Monkey. The Rooster. The Dog. It will probably be in October, the first day of... The day will be the first day of Inohi in October. The day of the Inoko visit to the castle. The Inoko visit? On the first day of Inohi at the beginning of October, all of the direct retainers of the Shogun will gather at Chiyoda Castle to celebrate the festival of Inoko. A once per year special occasion with a parade to the castle at night. They'll start to the visit in the early evening, between 4 and 5 PM. The Inoko festival among the townspeople will be going on at the same time. We must not miss this excellent timing. I understand. Very well. I'll kill the senior councilor Mizuno Tadakuni by myself, since we only have a handgun from the Dutch. Who will burn one of Yahiko-ya's oil warehouses? I'll do it! - Who will take care of Hikoemon? - I'll do it! Did you find out where Ichimonji-ya's secret oil refinery is? I still don't know. But it must be somewhere underground near Ichimonji-ya. I believe the woman street performer who lived next to us has already found out where it is. Being a woman, I bet she wants to kill Minokichi for some emotional reason. Should we catch her and torture her? Torture her and force her to confess. Or take her into our group and use her. Then what? After we've used her... Sir! The woman street performer got kidnapped! What about the children? Everybody! The old man, too! There's nothing in the room. It's empty! It doesn't seem as if they've been kidnapped. It looks like they packed their things and took off. What's this? "Koishikuba" This is still wet. That means it was just written. I see. She used a riddle from her performance to tell me where she was going. Look at that! Tetsu! Why don't you read this from a headstand position? Yes. How about it? Do you understand it? The reverse of Ura Mi would be Miura. Koishikuba is the beginning of the poem Kuzunoha. "Koishikuba..." (If you miss me...) "Tazune Kitemiyo Izuminaru," (Why not come and visit me, ) "Shinoda no Mori no?" (In the forests of Shinoda?) Well, that means at the den of the Shinoda fox. The den of the Shinoda fox. 'Ura Mi backwards would be Miura. "Shinoda no Mori no Urami Kitsuno." "MIURA" "FOR SALE" What happened to you? - Where are the children and the old man? - I helped them escape. Before I was caught, I got them away to safety. But I couldn't escape. So, they brought you here. Then what about the riddle telling me where you were? Who did it? How did you manage to write it? After I got caught, I was forced to write it. Why? Why are you in bed? I'm naked. What? They took all my clothes away, to keep me from escaping. And made me disclose where Ichimonji-ya's oil refining factory is. Now! Put this sheet around your body and get up! I don't think I'll let you do that. First, step back from there very slowly. Yes, yes. Walk to the alcove. Wait! Drop your Katana right there. Nemuri Kyoshiro, you're pretty smart. How did you find us? "Koishikuba? Tazune Kitemiyo?" (Will you come? Or not?) I was wondering if you caught the twist of the riddle. And by coming here to Miura, you did well! Why are you doing this? I want to be cautious. I don't want you to interfere in our business tonight. What's going on tonight? You'll find out soon. Wait until 5 PM. Waiting won't be so bad, since you'll be with a sexy woman. Until 5 PM? Yes. That's when the Shogun's direct retainers parade to the castle to celebrate the annual festival of Inoko. At the same time, we'll be burning down all of Yahiko-ya and Ichimonji-ya's oil warehouses. Fire will spread over all downtown and create an inferno! In avenging our teacher Oshio Jusai-sensei's brutal treatment at the hands of the government, this is only the beginning! You're one of the retainers of Jusai-sensei, who fought against the government for the poor. How can you kill a thousand innocent people just for your revenge? Shut up! I don't care! By the way, give me your short sword, too. Even though you're a master of the Full Moon Style, you'll die instantly if I shoot you with my gun. Why don't you give up? I want you to stay away from my work tonight, that's all. I can't let you do that! Why should your revenge against a corrupt government cause innocent people to die? I won't let you do that! You're very stubborn! You and I have a lot in common in our characters. That's why I want you to be on my side, rather than as an enemy. Why don't you understand my kindness? Cut the crap! As one of the 1,840,000 people of Edo, I will not allow you to carry out your murderous plans! I see. I see! I see! Whatever you say, I'll still have to do it. You just shut up and watch me. When your eyes get used to the darkness, take a look from the window. You have to see everything! They're the bodyguards hired by Yahiko-ya, students of Kusakabe Genshin's sword school. But they tricked Yahiko-ya and Ichimonji-ya and kidnapped them. That's right. As you might suspect. Money, money, money! By the way, from Yahiko-ya's company we demanded, in exchange for Yahiko-ya Hikoemon and Ichimonji-ya, they give us 100,000 ryo. The money is supposed to be delivered today. Then the bodyguards found out about the money, so they kidnapped them, and brought them here. They want to have a share of the 100,000 ryo. They're like animals. No morals, no loyalty. Since we're keeping them here, Aizen can't get the money from Yahiko-ya. So, he has to pay us whatever we want, or he'll have to beg us to bring them back to Yahiko-ya. So let's decide how much we want to ask for. They came to us to negotiate for the lives of Hikoemon and Ichimonji-ya. But we don't have a figure yet. I don't think we'll ever have a figure. The whole thing is just a ruse. We have to keep them busy until we can complete our mission. Eventually, I'll kill them both. To begin with, they're stupid enough to believe there will be 100,000 ryo. It's time. Everybody, thank you very much. Well, I'll give you some money. It's already 5 PM. Where is my husband? Mother! It's already 5 PM! It's already 5 PM! Hey! Hey! Big sister! It's the Hour of the Monkey! Today is the day! Uncle promised that he'd be back to give me a present at 5 PM on the day of the Inoko. He'll be here soon! Then I'll show you the present! - Watch out! - There, in the garden! There's Mizuno-sama! I can see the family crest. There is Roju Elder Mizuno Esshu-sama! Tricked! Fire! Fire, fire, fire! Downtown is burning! It could be around Yahiko-ya's neighborhood! What? If that is Yahiko-ya, our whole plan will fail! Hey, take them upstairs and let them see it. Take a good look. Is that your store or not? It has to be! Aizen did it! We can't get the money if the whole store burns down! Hey, Yahiko-ya! Where's the 100,000 ryo extortion money you were supposed to pay Aizen? - I don't have that much money! - What did you say? Are you forgetting about your promise? I can't believe you actually believed we had that amount of money to pay. You pitifully switched sides in order to get a share from them. Shut up! You bastard! Aizen promised to pay us in exchange for you! Now, where is the money? Tell me! If you really want money, why don't you get Aizen? He and his men are fugitives from the Oshio Affair. Get them! You'll get a lot of reward money from the government! Get them! Get them all! They did it! My store and my warehouse! All gone! Hey, you! How could you double-cross us? - That's your own greedy fault! - What did you say? You're fugitives from the Oshio Affair. I'll get you! What do you mean? We don't care about our lives. Everything is for our teacher Oshio-sensei's cause! Come on! Release me, too! Aizen! - How did you do? - How about Mizuno? - Rotten luck! They deceived us! - What? Aizen! Kyoshiro! You did it! Yes! If I say I'm going to do it, I'll do it. Unfortunately, I missed my mortal enemy, Mizuno Echizen no Kami. Look! Look! A burning inferno! If the wind shifts, the fire will reach the central keep and west wing of the castle! Burn the castle! Burn the Daimyo's mansions, the Retainers' mansions! If you want to burn them all, do it! But, how do you feel about the people who lost their houses and have no food for tomorrow? Whatever your intention was, Aizen, there is no way I can forgive you! Very well. You're worthy of battling. - Hey, you! - Stop! I'll take care of him. Let's go. I didn't have... time... to... give this to her... Take this... I promised to give... Yahiko-ya's little girl... Today is the day... Today is the... First day... of Inoko. THE END
