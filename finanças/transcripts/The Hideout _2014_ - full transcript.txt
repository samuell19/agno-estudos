Come on, over there. What are we gonna do? How the hell did this happen? ♫ All your lies ♫ Even the blind the can see ♫ Through the veil of your disguise ♫ ♫ We, the dead ♫ Truth lives for eternity ♫ Even in death you are denied ♫ Wake the dead ♫ Pushing them down ♫ Lay waste to all ♫ You better take ♫ All your lies ♫ Washed away in a rising sea It's another scorcher out tonight. We're hitting well over a hundred in this three-day heat wave and it's still February. In other news, there was a bizarre crime spree downtown. Apparently, a large group of homeless people began attacking random citizens in some sort of frenzy. You're late. Henry doesn't like to be kept waiting. Especially when it involves his money. I don't owe shit until next week, so why don't you crawl out of my ass? I'm gonna be deep in your ass like a bad case of hemorrhoids. Good, because I just had chili dogs. I told you, help comes in through the back, asshole. Where do you think you're going? Telling you to go fuck yourself. What'd you say to me you son of a bitch? Hiya, Cole. God, you look like death warmed over. Thanks, Charlie, you really know how to make a guy feel special. Sorry, I didn't mean anything by it. Can I get you anything? What I need, sweetheart, you ain't got. I heard about you and Henry. I guess word travels around here like a fart blown in the wind. Yeah, people like to talk. You're not in any kind of trouble, are you? Would you tell me if you were? Probably not, toots. Cole, you don't have to do this. We can just leave, get out of town. - I can... - What? Come with me? And what are we supposed to do, ride off into the sunset and live happily ever after? Yeah, why not? Why can't we just leave? Get out of this filth-ridden dump of a town. It wouldn't work. Not with me. Too many defects, honey. I guess you're right. Can I get you anything? Yeah, tell me where I might find Henry. He's in the back. Thanks, beautiful. Be careful. I've always been fascinated by man's insatiable appetite to inflict pain and suffering on one another. Yet they say torture is ineffective. They don't know what they fuck they're talking about. See, I've developed a method of torture that is foolproof, never failed. First, you light the tip of a wire hanger, much like this one. Then, when it's flaming hot, I shove it deep into the shaft of man's pisser. I've seen grown men give up their own mothers. Okay, okay, I'll do it, I'll get you in the vault. Whatever you guys want, just let me go, please. When? Friday, there's always stacks on cash on Friday. How many guards? Two or three. Randal, me boy, I just don't think we can trust your old pal here. No! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, there's four, you can trust me. Please, you can trust me, there's four. There's four, please, no! Cole. Just the man I wanted to see. You'll have to forgive me, but these things give me a wee bit of an appetite. Would you like something? No, thanks. Is there something you need? Someone just knocked the hell out of Billy. And you interrupt us for that? Go make yourself fucking useful and grab us a couple of pints. And shut the fuck up. Now, I'm guessing by that pathetic look on your face, that you don't have my money. No, I don't have it yet, but I'm working on it. And, you hope that you'll get it soon, right? Hope. Hope is a wonderful thing. You wanna see what hope looks like, Cole? Take a look over there, that's hope for you, a sad half-beaten sack of shit. No, he hoped his horse would come in, but lucky for me, it didn't, because he presented to me a very lucrative opportunity which would greatly improve our financial relationship. Look, Henry, I'm on the straight and narrow. Ah, ah, ah. I would take one last look at Mr. Hope and a Fucking Prayer before you start talking out the side of your mouth, boy. Why me, why not just get one of your gorillas to do it? I don't know, because you're fast, reliable, and nobody can trace you. What the fuck is it now? Sorry, I just caught her stealing. She's been coming up short every night for a month. - Is that true, sweetheart? - No, I didn't. Stealing from the grand hand that feeds you. I swear, no, I didn't do it. Give that little cunt to me. Pretty little cunt. Wait, wait. I'll do it, I'll take the job, just let her go. You gotta be kidding me. Music to my ears, Cole. You know, I have to admit, it will be kind of sad to let such a nice piece of ass go. But, you always did like my sloppy seconds. You wipe my debts clear after this. Get her the fuck out of here before I change my mind. Come on. Damn, what happened here? Wall Street happened here. This used to be a good neighborhood. You should wait here, this place is a little rougher than what you're used to. Come on, Cole, I can take care of myself. Oh, shit. I told you, you couldn't touch the girls in here, didn't I? What the hell are you talking about, man, I was just giving her a tip. - A tip? - Yeah. You can't put tips in these girls panties in here. This is a family restaurant, not a goddamn strip joint. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're lucky I know your momma. What? I said say hi to your momma. Say hi to her, she's a beautiful lady, say hi to her. Fucking asshole. What the fuck are you looking at, asshole? That's funny, because I thought I was looking at an asshole. Oh shit, if it isn't the craziest goddamn redneck that ever crawled out from under a steaming heap of cow pies. How you doing, man, I thought you were dead. I thought you were in the joint. I was, you know the case didn't stick. I was just telling these slobs in there about the old days. Those days are still a little hazy. Wait, wait, wait, you're gonna tell me you don't remember that time we were cornered by the federales in a Tijuana whorehouse with four kilos of coke? Yeah, that was a long time ago. Aye, mami, heaven had sent an angel. Damn baby, you got a pair of chops that I'd love to smother in my own special gravy, if you know what I'm saying. Huh, what? - Actually, I don't. - You don't know? Chill, man, this is Charlie, she's with me. Oh shit, man, sorry about that. Nice to meet you, Cole's girl. No, it's not like that. Yo, so what brings you to this fucking shithole side of this fucking shithole town, huh? A job, a job for Henry. Henry? You mean Hacksaw Henry? The same lunatic that gets off on mutilating people's junk? The very one. Oh, forget it, man, we're cool. I was hoping I can depend on you on this. I need you on this, I need the crew. Shit, man. Shit. What do you need? If it isn't Joey Numbers and Mr. Tony Dimes. It's good to see you. Looks like we're all here. I'm assuming that's not your dirty laundry in that bag. Yeah, I was my laundry was this lethal. Ha, you mean like your underwear, huh? No, I mean like your breath. It's everything he asked for, a couple of masks, a radio, walkie-talkies in here, got some pistols. My own personal favorite. All clean and untraceable. Good, now listen up, I'm only gonna say this once. - Charlie's driving. - What? You can't have a broad drive a getaway, man. Hugo - Wait. If he's got a problem with me driving, I'd like to hear about it. Look, no offense, honey, okay. But you know, we all know you know that, let's face it, we know that you know, women can't drive worth a squat. Oh. You know, that's why all the best race car drivers of all-time have always been men, right? Cole, come on. Oh. I'm sorry, you know, but you bitches can't take the pressure. Can't handle that kind of pressure? - They can't take it. - No, no? How's this for pressure? It's a bit much. For your information, my pops was a derby car racer and he taught me everything he knew. Okay, okay. God. Fuck. Now listen up, you need to keep it together. There's a lot riding on this, okay? Like I was saying before, Tony and Numbnuts here are on crowd control. Me and Numbers will handle the package, and we meet Henry back at the hideout for the exchange. - Any questions? - No. Alright, good. - Alright, Numbnuts. - I've got a piece for you. Cole, I got a really bad feeling about Hugo. Did he tell you how he got out of the joint? Yeah, something about the DA couldn't make a case. That's funny, because that's not what I heard. He robbed a liquor store, ran away about six blocks, and was found passed out with the money still on him. Damn, it's hot. Relax, it's almost time. Keep the engine running. See any sign of trouble, just leave, we'll find our own way. Remember, we have a 90 second window, don't fuck it up. While we're young, fatass, go. Hey, good luck, hon. Thanks, I won't need it. That was a real shit job, I'm talking literally. We were neck deep in sewage. We had to crawl through a mile-long sewer pipe like rats. It took me a month to get that stench off of me. Everything I ate tasted, smelled, and even looked like shit. Will you shut the fuck up before I shoot you? Just trying to take the edge off. Both of you shut up, Tony, do your thing. Everybody on the fucking floor. Get on the floor, get on the floor, right now! If anyone gives us a problem, I'm gonna start shooting people one by one, starting with the women and the children. Get on the fucking floor. Help. Are you okay? Please, it's hot, give me water. I'm sorry, I don't have any water. Oh, the heat, the heat, it's hot, I can't stand it. It's everywhere. The heat, can't stand it, it's everywhere. It's gonna kill us all. Get the fuck out of the way, get the fuck out of my way. Go, go, go. Who the fuck was that, fuck it, let's go. Come on, go! You think you can pop that? I just want to say you did a good job back there. Thanks. Hey, your phone. So I'm in this bar, right. And I pick up this fat chick, right, I'm telling you, she was enormous. I'm talking like fucking battleship, big, right. So I get her in the back seat of my Cadillac, right. Then we're like going at it, you know, we're steaming up the windows, sweat's pouring like all over us and shit. Yo, yo, yo, okay, can you shut the fuck up, man? I'm trying to concentrate over here. The fuck's with this guy, so fucking uptight. It's legit, the kid was right on the marker. It's easy half a mill. We did good. Great, great, can I finish my story now? When aren't you telling a story? You're like one of those chatty Cathy dolls, you never shut the fuck up. Come on, come on, come on, let him finish, let him finish. Thank you. So as I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted by this guy. Okay, so we were going at it all hot and heavy, like right, fucking just going at it, right. And then this broad tells me, you know, she tells me she wants me to fuck her in the backdoor, right so I'm like what the hell, you know. So I'm like two to three seconds into it, killing, right, and then all of a sudden, you know, this bitch fucking shits all over me, man. All over my dick, all over my clothes, all over my fucking car seat, and then she fucking starts throwing up over the side of it, man. You're throwing up, bitch is throwing up. I gotta say that was the worst fucking moment of my life. Yeah but what happened, I mean did you finish? Did you come? You know I fucking came. - Come on. - What the hell? What the hell's the matter with you two, don't you have any stories that don't involve shit? I didn't know you were so sensitive, man. Are you kidding me? Get out of here before I stick my gun so far up your ass, you'll be coughing up bullets for a month. Sorry, man, ah shit. Come on, everybody out. Hey, I need to show you something. I'm not sitting between you smelly fucks anymore, I'm getting a window seat from now on. What the fuck is this here, huh? Deliverance, huh? Squeal like a pig-boy, huh? What'd you say, asshole? Look at the balls on Opie here, huh? You will be squealing like a pig. You got a problem, fat boy. Maybe I do, brokeback, you fucking redneck. - Hugo, back off! - Fucking redneck. Listen, fellas, I'm sorry, my friend here, he's just a little frustrated. The last time he saw some pussy was when he was coming out of it. Yeah, whatever. Forget you jackoffs. We're cool, right? Goddamn tenderfoot city folk, got no goddamn respect. Got that right, Nelson. Are you fucking crazy? Did you forget what we have in the car? Get in the fucking car. Oh yeah, you forgot something. Yeah, thanks man. Where the hell are we going? Stash the pack, we can't risk getting caught with it. Who the fuck's gonna catch us, huh, Davy Crockett? Just keep walking. You better believe I'm sending Henry a bill for this shit. These shoes are Italian leather, cost me five large. You got ripped off, they're made in China. Fuck you, huh. And another thing, why does Henry get half? We're the ones out here doing all the work. I bet he's at home sitting on his fat ass sipping a mai tai while we dragging our sorry rumps through the muck. How much further we gotta go? Why the fuck are we stopping? 'Cause we're here. Here? Here, where the fuck is here? Oh shit. I thought he'd never shut up. What the fuck, Cole? Yeah, you're just offing people now? Just calm down. I'll calm down when motherfuckers stop randomly taking dirt naps. He was a rat, Charlie found this on him. What the fuck is that, grandma's hearing aid? No, it's a bug. It's in his phone. There could be more of those things in the car. Oh okay, so she found it, huh? How do you know she didn't plant it on him, or set him up and get a bigger cut? Why don't you ask Numbers, he's the one who brought it to my attention. You knew about this? I heard things, I wasn't for sure. I didn't think we'd just jump trial and go straight to execution. We don't have time for this shit. The cops could be on our ass right now. You're just gonna have to trust me. Hey, the only one I trust is myself and sexy Sylvia here. Enough, put your fucking gun away. You put your gun away, motherfucker! Alright, alright! What the fuck are you doing, Numbers, get your gun up. He's right, he's right, if someone's on the other end of that tracker, you think we wanna be stuck here with our thumbs up our asses? Come on. So what now? Get rid of him. What? Wait, wait, wait, wait, why do we get the shit detail? You shot him. Hey fucko, I'm talking to you. Fuck! You okay? I don't wanna talk about it. It's not your fault, Cole, he turned on us. You had no choice, he backed you into a corner. I said I don't wanna talk about it, alright? I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me. Just have this splitting headache. Oh my god, your ear. - It's fine. - No. Let's get you inside, come on. "Take care of it." Take care of it, like this is our fucking responsibility? We could throw him in the creek. You know what, Hugo might've been a rat, but he was right about one thing. What's that? We shouldn't split a dime with Henry. We're doing all the damn work here. Fucking fat Irish. Well, we're gonna have to do something with the body. I know, chop him up, throw him in the river bed. Let's go, man. Where the hell is he? How the fuck am I supposed to know? Maybe he wasn't dead. He had half a dozen holes in him the size of billard balls, I'd say he's good as dead. Well, he's not here now is he? Shut up, just go. Man, that salsa nigger was lucky I was in a good mood. Where the hell is Coop? Thought he was out getting some booze? I don't know, man, where the hell is that boy? Maybe he's out squirting mud butter. I'm getting thirsty man, shit. Fuck happened here? Coop, where are you, Coop? Coop? Look what they did, man. Destroyed everything. Coop? Coop, where the hell are you? Coop? Coop, what you looking at, boy? Hey, Coop? What the hell happened to you? Help me, help me! Damn it, can't even get a drink when you need one. Another one. Fuck. You idiot, if anyone heard you, we're fucked. Come on. What in God's name is happening out there? It's like all hell broke loose. Jesus. Hey man, look at me. I don't know what's happening here, but there's some crazy shit going down, so you'd best man the fuck up right now. It's best to put her out her misery. You okay? If you fire that weapon anywhere near me, boy, I'll put you down myself, you got it? What? What the fuck is that? What's what? Did you hear that shit, it's like screaming or something. Oh shit, go, go, run! Come on. Hurry up, get ready, they're here. You stupid fucking mess, you fucking attack me? Shit. Wait a second. - There's something in there. - Shh, shh. Come on. Oh shit! Jesus fucking Christ. Poor baby. Damn it, come on, go. 467,000 and some change. Where the hell are these assholes? They probably just got lost, they'll be back sooner or later. What was that? I don't know. This better not be some kind of joke. You assholes better not be fucking around out there. Fuck. Where have you two been? - Where's Cole? - Shit. Forget Cole, we need to find the money and get the hell out of here. Some major shit going down. What are you talking about? He's talking about how everything outside has gone to hell. You're making a mess. Hey, you don't seem to fucking understand here, we need to make this place a distant memory. You're welcome to leave but the money stays put until Henry gets here. Yeah, I don't remember anyone putting you in charge. That's the way it's gonna be. Oh my god, what happened to your hand? I had an accident, fiddling with the fuse box somebody sabotaged. Hey why don't you guys go check to see if we made the news. Go check it yourself. What was that? I got it, I'll take care of it. Hey look, we've been talking, Numbers and me. Oh yeah, what about? We don't like how things have been going around here. We want things to change, the leadership. Is that right? Turn it down. Listen up, Cole, we ain't taking orders from you anymore. As a matter of fact, I'm getting sick and tired of looking at your ugly mug. And if you think we're just gonna wait around and get attacked by whatever it is outside, and then hand our money over to Hacksaw, you must've lost your goddamn mind. We're getting out of this screwed up place with the money. You know what I've been craving all day, guacamole. You guys like Mexican food? Personally, I can't live without it. Are you fucking listening to me? I'll bet you didn't know that avocado is actually a fruit. We're changing the pecking order around here! I ain't sitting around and be turned into fertilizer like Hugo, I'm taking my share and I'm hitting the road. Oh yeah, and how are you gonna do that? Whoa, whoa, calm down. You really wanna try me? - Please don't... - Shut the fuck up, bitch. Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, that's right, who's the bitch now? What the fuck? Oh fuck, god. What was that about the pecking order? That's enough, get off of him. Now! You got it, chief. Look, we had a long fucking day and we're all exhausted, alright? And I hate to be a broken fucking record, but calm the fuck down. Just keep him in line. That's fine. I gotta get this A/C working though. There. Now, let's try and be civilized. Please anyone. If there's anyone out there right now watching this. Something has happened, something terrible. The whole place is infected by some kind of madness. Reports are stating that strange weather patterns are driving up the heat and making some people unbalanced. Officials are advising people to remain indoors, keep your body temperatures low and hydrate often. Some symptoms include headaches, nausea, nosebleeds, and fever. Please contact your local authorities if you or anyone you know has these symptoms... I told you, I fucking told you. Should be in goddamn Mexico by now. Why can't we get any other channels? I don't know, but I ain't waiting around for the cable guy. We need to get the fuck out of here now. What do you think, Cole? That man looked like a mad dog. Only a moron swallows everything he sees on TV. You think that's bullshit? You saw the man's face, and what about out there? I saw with it my own eyes. He's right, we should go. Okay, go where, huh? Say it is real, how do we know it hasn't spread to every city in the country? Now she said stay inside and keep cool, and that's what we should do. Fuck. Nothing works in this damn house. I really think something's wrong, Cole. Henry should've been here by now. She's right, when it comes to his money, he's always on time. What should we do? Yeah Cole, what do we do? We sit tight and wait. Yeah, great plan there. How's the arm? It's fine. Work damn it. Numbers, will you cool it with the banging, please? Did you ever ask yourself, why in the hell would Henry want to meet us all the way out here in the middle of nowhere? I mean, shit, we could've dropped his share off to him and been miles from here. He's right, Cole. This whole thing stinks. Maybe Henry's plan was to get rid of us and take the score for himself, you ever think about that? Will you keep your brilliant theories to yourself? You're putting ideas into everybody's head. Also, we should listen to a man who shot a pal in cold blood. Come on, guys, cool it. Numbers, can you stop it with the goddamn banging? Look, Hugo was a rat. Now, I don't know what bug crawled up your ass, but you better dig it out and squash it fast, or me and you are gonna have another problem. That wasn't me. That's Henry's car alright. Where are they? Henry? Henry? Henry? I told you we should've left. Will you shut up? Henry? Cole, help me. Come on, help me get him up. Come on, let's get him in the cabin, come on. This guy weighs a ton. Shut the door. Move the furniture against the door. I'm not gonna be able to hold this, you guys, come on. - Move, move! - Move! Henry, are you okay? Come on, Henry. Get the fuck off me. Stay back. We need to move, people. We have to help him. Baby, I ain't helping nobody but myself. You can't leave us like this. Watch me. Numbers? You son of a bitch. This isn't right, we shouldn't leave them. Does it look like I give a shit about what's right. I'm rich, money's the only thing that, the fuck? Damn it. Cole, Cole? Oh, good. You okay? Oh shit. Put your gun down. Fuck you, you put your gun down. This isn't a fucking request, put your gun down. Is there anything to drink? Beer, liquor? Goddamn alcoholic beverage of sorts? They left us for dead. And now we saved your ass, so we're even. Fuck you. Sure would be nice to get a frosty one right about now. The phone books were a nice touch. Honor among thieves, right? Nice shotgun you got there. Yeah, found it in Henry's trunk. Looks like he was planning a little party. Fuck. He only came back for the money. Who needs money when civilization is about to end, sugar pie? Bullshit, why'd you come back? You couldn't wait to get out of here a minute ago. I came back to help you. He couldn't get the car started. Listen, we need to secure this place and keep our body temperatures down. We can wait this thing out. - This can't be happening. - It's gonna be okay. What about our families? We don't know what's going on out there. So let's not jump ahead of ourselves. For all we know, they're safe. And right now, we have to stay alive for them. - You okay? - Yeah, I'll be fine. Have Charlie look at that when we get back inside. Look, I know you care about her. You act like you don't, but I can see it right in your eyes, you care about her. So why don't you do her and us a favor and get us the hell out of this place. I mean shit, she's the reason we're here in the first place. You're right, I do care about her, and that's why I'm keeping my distance. But at least I'm man enough to admit why I'm here, and that's pure, unadulterated greed. And I'm not gonna say it again. I'm not going out there half-cocked until we know what we're dealing with out there, you got it? Let's get back inside. Hey, is she gonna be okay? She'll be just fine. If she's not. Is he gonna be okay? He's been through a lot tonight. I trust you'll be watching him. Numbers. Go take a break, get yourself some water. I'm fine. Get yourself some water. He'll be fine. You're gonna be okay. Hey, hey, Numbers, you're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. We still need to board up the windows in the bedroom. I got it. Need some help? No, I think I can handle it. Oh, would you look at that, a crawl space. Could use that if those things get inside. I already checked it, it's too small. Maybe I should take a look. I think we should focus on securing the windows. One thing that prison has taught me is to always be ready. Yeah, I can see that's really worked out for you. What's in there? My porn collection. Must be a nice collection. Why don't you give me a gander? It's kind of personal. Yeah, it must be, considering all the trouble you're going through to hide it while one of those things would like nothing more than to rip your eyes out. I guess you can say it has sentimental value. Quit bullshitting me. You guys better get in here. To be continued. Shit. When did this start? A few minutes ago. There's a fever. Numbers, were you bit or scratched? No, no, no, no, I just need a minute. Sit down, sit down. He must've swallowed some of that blood. We need to get him some medical attention now. No, no, we can't leave not with those things out there. We have to deal with this here and now. We have to get his temperature down. I'll go get some ice. What do you suggest we do, then? Look at him, he's gone, we have to throw him out. How do you even know he's infected, are you a doctor? What if it's just a cold? Does that look like a cold to you? If we don't act, we risk being exposed to whatever it is out there. We're not throwing him out like trash, what if that was you? I'd do myself in before I turn into one of those things. Oh trust me, you won't have to. Oh my god, he's burning up. We have to pay for our sins. He's got the same eyes Henry had. Hey, chill out, Numbers, don't start falling apart on me now. But this is what God wants. This is what God demands. This definitely isn't God's doing. It's okay, he can't get in. What about him? You sons of bitches, you're gonna pay for this. You're gonna pay for this, you're all gonna pay for this. Relax, we're doing this for your own good. My own good? Settle down, goddamn it. I had some Vicodins, this should calm him down. Drink it. What? I'm a waitress, and my feet hurt sometimes. What am I supposed to do if I have to pee? We'll cross that bridge when we get there. What was that? I don't know, sound like it came from one of the bedrooms. Hold your fire, hold your fire, it's just a jacket. Well, it's better to be safe than sorry. I'm going after her, secure this window, and you make sure you let us back in. Are you listening to me? Yeah, I got it, go. Are you okay? - Hey? - I'm fine, I'm fine. Come on, we gotta keep moving. Shit. Come on, go, go, go. Take it down. How the hell did you get loose? Just take it down, don't make me ask you again. What do you think you're doing, Numbers? Doing the right thing, man, they have to be able to get back in. Okay put the gun down, you're not thinking straight, okay. Your head's all screwed up. If those things get inside, we're both dead. My head's fine. Numbers, Numbers, I know where Cole hid the money. We can take it. I'll pay for this in the next life. Come on. Get up, come on, let's go. Tony, open the goddamn door. Open the door! Hold it. It stopped. Oh my god! You bastard, you locked us out. Just listen to me for a second. Numbers attacked me, I had to put him down. He was turning into one of those things out there. Where is he? He's secure now. How do you know he turned? Because he attacked me. You didn't have to kill him. We could have helped him. Don't be stupid, he would've killed us all. Oh, and you conveniently shot him, locked us out, and got the money down? You've been a busy boy. Yeah, I was scared, okay, I panicked. How was I supposed to know you'd make it back? Okay, money makes men do funny things. It does do that. Now where's that car of yours? You wanna go out there, are you out of your mind? Those things are everywhere, and they hunt like a pack of wolves. You'd never make it. Oh I'll make it alright, because I'm gonna use you two as bait. See while those animals are devouring you like a Thanksgiving dinner, I'll be making my getaway. And if anyone finds you sons of bitches, you'll be crazed like those things out there. Open the door, sweetie, open the fucking door. Open the fucking door. Come on, Tony, you don't have to do this. Yeah, there's enough money to go around. Why would I share it when I could keep it all for myself. Now, move. You're fucking crazy. Oh, we'll see about that, now move. Please don't do this, Tony. We don't want the money, please take it. Shut your face and open the door. If we open that door, we're all dead. Do it now! You sons of bitch! Get off me! Cole? Please say something. Hold on, I'm thinking. What are we gonna do? I don't know. Oh my god, they're in here. Alright, alright, shh. What are you doing? There's a gun. No, you can't go out there, you can't leave me. You can't leave me here. Look, if those things get in here, we're dead anyways. I have to try while they're busy. You have to lock this door behind me. Come on, the window, come on. Come on! Charlie, just go, save yourself. I'm gonna deal with this. No, no, Cole you have you survive, please. - Leave me. - No, no! No! Cole! Come on, come on, come on. You're shaking like a leaf. Don't worry, I won't let anything happen to you. Hey, let's get some water. Wait, there's something on your face. Charlie, Charlie, wait! Oh my god! Shit. Oh god. Jesus, what were you thinking? I don't know, I freaked. We're not gonna die, are we? I don't wanna die. We're not gonna die. Come on, we gotta keep moving, come on. I got you, come on. Come on, over there. What are we gonna do? Here, come on. How the hell did this happen? Charlie, run! You had no choice, he forced you into a corner. I said I don't wanna talk about it, alright? I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me, I just have this splitting headache. Oh my god, your ear. Why the fuck are we stopping? - Because we're here. - Here? Where the fuck is here? - Thought he'd never shut up. - What the fuck, Cole? Yeah, you're just offing people now? Honor among thieves, right? Oh my god, your ear. Why in the hell would Henry want to meet us all the way out here? I'd do myself in before I turned into one of those things. Oh trust me, you won't have to. It was an accident, fiddling with the fuse box somebody sabotaged. That man, looked like a mad dog.
