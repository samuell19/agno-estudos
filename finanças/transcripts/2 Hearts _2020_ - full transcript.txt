There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle. I choose to believe the latter, and for good reason. My mother is always reminding me, there is often more to things than meets the eye. That if we can zoom out a little, we'll realize that life is happening for us, not to us. And if we just allow it to, the ride can be beautiful, awesome and fantastic. She never said that it would be easy. Look, I get it, it doesn't always seem like rainbows and butterflies. Chris. It's hard to zoom out in a moment like this. It's hard to believe that this was life happening for me. Chris? Chris, please wake up. Or for any of us. It certainly didn't feel like there could be anything good about this situation. But hang on, I'm getting ahead of myself. This story really starts years before I was even born... Pressure! Here we go. ...with another kid from another part of the world. Safe! Back off! Come on! What about Jorge? - Does he have the wind? - Three minutes left. Bolivar! Bolivar! Come on. You're in. I need you in midfield. You need to put pressure on. We need a goal, OK? We need the win. Make it happen. - OK. - Make it happen. Let's go, boys! Yes! Push it up! Get to the middle! Jorge Bolivar and I could not have been further apart. I was from a middle-class American family. Jorge was practically Cuban royalty. Who would have believed that our lives and our families would come together in a way none of us could have imagined? The surgery looks to be a success. He's on his way to the ICU right now. Oh, thank God. We did have to remove the lower lobe of his left lung. He'll still be able to breathe, but I need to warn you, the disease is progressive. You need to prepare yourself for the fact that your son most likely won't make it to 20. We were told he wouldn't make it to 12. My advice is to not let him exert himself too much. He just doesn't have the lung capacity. Papa? We're here, son. You're going to be all right. You're a fighter. I'm a fighter. You're a fighter. And he was a fighter. He took every day as it came as borrowed time. Hey, the phone's been ringing for you all afternoon, George. It's from Cuba. All right. Hello? Jorge, I've been trying to reach you. Papa? Is that you? - Yes, Jorge. - What's going on? Is everything OK? I need you to go to Miami, to help set things up for us. - When? - As soon as possible. Castro is becoming... unpredictable. - Castro is just... - We don't know what he'll do next. Get to Miami. We'll catch up with you as soon as we can. - OK. OK. - Revolutionary... This was one of those zoom-out moments. Life was happening for Jorge. Yo! What are you... No. No, no, no. You're not playing video games. Have you seen it? It's beautiful outside. Come on, man. Let's go. Yo, come on. We gotta get moving. We gotta get Brian, Matt, the Douvilles. We gotta pick them up on the way. So let's go. - And who's driving? - Um, you are. Man, when are you gonna get your license? Why would I do that when I got you? Hmm? There it is! Ooh! Whoo! Yo! Yo, I got you, I got you, I got you. - You know, you know. - Go, go, go! Whoo! Of course you'd make that shot. Yo, Chris. Chris, this isn't funny. Chris! Stop fucking around. Was that a swish? Because I think I distinctly heard a swish right there. Ho! Whoo! - Hey! - Huh? Mom and Dad want you home. Johnny Boy, I'm gonna enjoy this for a minute then I'll get you in the car. Now, hot shot. Jeez, man. You should have come out with us today, it was real fun. Or not. Everybody's entitled to their own weekend, I suppose. You're not coming inside? I got a study session. OK. All right. Cool, cool. Uh, good chat. Hello, dearest parents. Your favorite son has arrived. Damn it. OK. Maybe your second-favorite son. - Hey, Mom. - Hey, honey. I made you some sandwiches. They're on the table. Thanks. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Did you open this? Yeah. I'm sorry. But you did get into Loyola. I know Colin will be really happy to have you there. Yeah. Well, I... I guess I just had this idea that John and I would go to the same college and... do the whole roommates thing, you know? Yeah, I know. You know what? I think I'm... I'm just gonna go downstairs. Thanks for the, uh... the food. Maybe you should have worked harder at it. Hey. Rough one. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe he's right. Come here. Your mom needs some love. Your mom needs some love. Aw! You know I can see what you're doing. This is kind of obvious. I just want you to remember that when things don't work out, there's always a reason. We just might not see it in the moment... What's the reason? John might actually crack a smile for once if I went to school with him? Maybe. And maybe there's something for you at Loyola. Ah, because life is happening for me, not to me, right? Oh! Look at my smart son listening to his mom. Yeah. You know, when you say words, I actually hear them, it's weird. That's very good to know. Now, I want you to call your brother Colin and tell him the good news. Yes, ma'am. Go on, go on. - I'm kidding. - I'll just go listen over here. Yeah, OK. Hey, man. What's up? Yeah. No, no. I'm good. Uh, look, I was just calling to let you know that your better-looking, more talented, smarter little brother is coming to Loyola, so get ready. My mom was right. I had to trust that there was a bigger reason things were happening the way they were. And same for Jorge. After all, he did make it past 20, all the way to 30. And he was just about to meet his bigger reason. Lunch menus. Lunch menus. - Menu? - Yes, please. - All right. - Is this your first flight, sir? Oh, no. It's like this every time. - Deep breaths. - Oh, I'm trying. Trust me. Sir. Listen, is there anything I can do to make take-off a little easier for you? You could hold my hand. It would make it a lot easier for me to breathe if you were holding my hand. I think this might actually help. There you go. And how's that? One small step in the right direction. - Peanuts? - Getting warmer. Just... please. Just... Just for take-off. So, do you have a name, in case I need to summon a medic or something? Jorge. - Jorge. - Yeah. Are you in Puerto Rico for business or pleasure, Jorge? - It's business. - Business. But it's quickly shifting to pleasure. - What kind of business? - Rum. - Rum? - Hm-hmm. My father wanted to make sure that we could handle our liquor - before we went to college. - OK. Turns out that rum is actually my favorite. Do you have a favorite brand? Well... Bolivar, of course. OK. Well, this is... This is more than a coincidence. Oh! You work for Bolivar. Bolivar. OK. Well, you don't waste time, do you? I don't have time to waste. So you made it. I did. - I really enjoyed talking to you. - Me too. I think I've finally got the circulation back in my fingers. I'm so sorry about that. In Miami for long? - Uh, just tonight. - Oh. And how can I see you again? You just like that Bolivar is my favorite drink. Of course I do, but how can I see you again? All right, Mr. Bolivar. Let's see if that's just the rum talking. The most important thing is that we do not skip a beat. What's her name? - It's the future Mrs. Jorge Bolivar. - What? Boys! Focus! Let's get to work. As always, readings for next week are listed in the syllabus, and a reminder that pop quizzes make up 30 percent of your grade. Hint, hint. - Thirty percent. - See you next week. Aw, excuse me. My bad. Thank you. Oh! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. That's my fault. I, um... I, I didn't, um... That's... it's my fault. Um... Excuse me. Excuse me. All right. Let's get settled. Hey. Are you in this class also? Hm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. This... Nope. No, uh... I was. I'm... I'm gonna go now. Sorry for the... Excuse me. I don't know. The dude just smells. That's roommates, man. Wait. Have you asked him about it? I'm worried he's one of those... one of those hoarders who leaves half-eaten chicken carcasses under his bed. - Gross. Have you checked? - I'm scared to. The smell's so bad, though, I'm gonna have to. Yeah. Anyway, pray for me. - Yeah. Good luck, man. - See ya. What is he talking about? Hey, bro, you seem a little dazed. First month of college getting to you? - I had a vision. - Huh? - A vision. - What's a vision, Chris? It was the most beautiful girl that I've ever seen. Seriously, in my entire life. - Yeah? - Yeah. You are not usually one to get flustered about a girl. I know. But she's, like, angelic, man. It was this vision, like, right in front of me. I gotta see her again. I can't go to class. I gotta see her. - Hey, hey! Slow your roll, dude. - I have to see her. - I'm serious. - There will be plenty of girls, Chris. Not like this one, man. Not like this one. My brother was right. I was only a freshman, and there would be plenty of girls. But she was right in front of me. - Ooh! - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, I was lost. - You. - You. - Safety patrol. - Yeah. What do you think? Lame? No, not... not exactly lame. But there's no... ring to it. Well, it depends what you're trying to say. Are you trying to say, "We, the Safety Patrol, are here to patrol you"? Or are you trying to say, like, "Yo! What's up, guys? We're trying to have a good time. Safety Buddy's here to get you home safely"? All right. OK, I see your point. It's a little too scary. Just a tad. But I need people to know how serious this. No, absolutely, and I agree with you. That's why I think maybe if you... change it a little bit, people might actually... - OK. - ...wanna join or use the service. OK. Fair point. Thank you. - These are yours. - Yep. And I'm... I'm Chris Gregory. Hi, Chris Gregory. - Hi. - And thank you for your input. Yeah. See, aren't you glad you bumped into me? - Twice. - Twice. - Hm-hmm. - Yes. Yeah. Twice. - Samantha. - Sam. Just Sam. Sam. Just Sam. OK. Cool. Well, Just Sam, today's your lucky day. - You just got your first Safety Buddy. - Really? - Yeah. - You want to join? Definitely. I can tell you care about it. - I do. Great. - That's me, this guy. Then you are my first safety driver. - Ahh! - What? See, I can't drive. - You can't drive? - Don't have my license. - Oh. - But I'm getting it. - Oh? - Yes, and you're gonna help me. - I'm gonna help you? - Until then, I'll be your ride-along. - My what? - Yeah. Like your buddy in the side. Why do I have this feeling like I'm getting conned into something? Because you are. But it's gonna work out for you in the end. - Is it? - Yes. And, um... Hmm... It's not really safe for the Safety Buddy to be so pretty, right? Well, OK, then. OK, yeah. Oh, what's that? You need me in class? Oh! What are you gonna do? I gotta go. Yeah. Maybe, uh, change it. Yeah. Oh, my goodness. - You're here! - I am. Yes. - On your way to... - Seattle. Yeah. I was just hoping we could get more time to talk. Well, that would be nice. I mean, I love my family, but it's just they're perfectly content to stay in the same small town, and I felt like I needed to get out and see the world a bit before, you know, I settled down. It makes perfect sense to me. I can't believe you're here. - You just showed up. - I did. I just showed up. I thought you would call or something. W-Would you rather I called instead? - No. - No? No. I love that you... I mean, you caught me by surprise. Can you ask me another question or something so I can stop blushing like this? Um... Do you enjoy being a stewardess? Uh, yes, I do. It's given me a much-needed sense of independence. Hmm. You feel free. I love that. - Yeah. For the most part. - For the most part? I mean, I wouldn't have been able to see any of this if it wasn't for my job. You mean, like, Seattle? Yeah. I wouldn't have been able to see... Seattle. I don't know about you, but I prefer a little bit more sunshine. Me too. Well, that's good to know. What time is it? Oh, my Lord. I have to go. Are you all right? It's just... Yeah. Are you sure? It's dust is all. It's over. I'm OK. All right. Well, thank you for... dropping by. It's a pleasure. Yeah. I gotta fly. - OK. - Literally. All right. Bye! Oh! Wow. How long were you standing there? I saw, like, the whole entire dance. All of it, the... Yeah, well, I do this thing, this procrastination thing, where I have to clean everything before I can actually sit down and study. Sounds like a cool thing. Listen, if you want to stop by my place when you're done here, that'd be great because I could really use your service. - Hmm, let me think about it. No. - No? OK, then... - Hi. - Wow. That is quite the outfit you got on. Thanks. Thank you. I got this for you. - What? - It's your Safety Buddy shirt. - We're gonna wear them, like twins. - My Safety Buddy shirt? Pretty safe, huh? Wow. You are such a nerd. Yes, yes, I'm a massive nerd. Oh. - Ooh, I gotta get this. - You get that. - But call me on Saturday. - Yes. You got it, OK. Bring that. - I'll bring it. - OK, all right. Enjoy. Hey, Brad. Hey, yeah. I was just talking to this freshman who's gonna help me with Safety Buddies. Thank you. Thought you said you liked the sunshine. - I did. I do. - Yeah? - Wow. - Are you happy? Happy, yes. Oh, Jorge. - I've only got a ten-hour layover. - We better get going then. I give you Hawaii. What do you think? Should we go in? - Huh? - All right. - Come on. - Is it cold? I'm just a little sensitive. - Oh, it's fine. - Are you sure? - Seriously. - I'm a little bit sensitive. That's not nice. That's very not nice. Whoo! Now I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you! - You win. You win. - OK. You totally win. Am I in paradise? - No, it's real. - This doesn't feel real. No! - You're a fish. - Yeah. I love the ocean. Yeah. I can tell. You know a lot about me now. Tell me some more about you. More than that I love the ocean and I find you incredibly beautiful? Yes. More. So I work with my family in the rum business, as you know. We were forced to leave our headquarters in Cuba when I was in college, and ever since then, I've been heading the Puerto Rican operation. Do you like it? Heading the Puerto Rican operation or working with my family? Both. Well, I like that I get to travel to Puerto Rico. In regards to working with my family, I... I haven't known anything else. But I wouldn't change that. I love my family. Family's everything to me. And I'm very proud of the Bolivar legacy that I'm a part of. Family is very important to me, too. - Is it? - I want to have a huge family. I want to have dozens and dozens of babies. Leslie, we just met. You're talking about our babies already. I've noticed that you cough a lot. You did? Yeah. Well, I noticed it a few times. I was hoping you wouldn't. It's nothing, really. I was just wondering if it had anything to do with the scar on your back. I'm sorry. Was that too personal? No. No. It's... You know, maybe it's just one of those things I... you know, I haven't known any other way. I don't talk about it much. At all, really. Why not? Maybe it's machismo, I guess. I don't want to show my weakness. Especially with you. Well, you don't have to worry about that. I know that. I know. Somehow you make me feel very much at ease. I hope I do. I can't believe this day's already over. - So it was a good surprise. - I don't want it to end. Neither do I. Listen, I don't know what's going on, but I just feel so close to you already, and after hearing everything that happened to you as a child, and everything that you've been through, I don't want us to be apart. What if something happens to you? - You know what you are? - What? - A peanut. - What? The sweetest peanut I've ever laid my eyes on. - A peanut? - Yeah, my peanut. And you don't have to worry about me. - We have plenty of time together. - Do you promise? I promise. Hold on. Before you leave, just one thing. Guys. ♪ Today I may not have ♪ A thing at all ♪ Except for just a dream or two Yeah, well, you gotta admit... ♪ But I've got lots of plans... Jorge had some strong charm. ♪ And all my tomorrows... I mean, so did I. I just... I just wish mine was as classy and smooth. Sorry, man. I'm not gonna make it to this one tonight. What do you mean? What are you doing instead? I got this, um, Safety Buddies thing. It's like a... A what thing? Safety Buddies. I've gotta drive people that, like, they call us, and we drive them back home from wherever they are. Um, Chris? You don't drive. I don't. Thank you for telling me. It's about that girl, isn't it? It's the girl, man. Seriously, I've never seen you like this. She's special, man. I can't... can't explain it. All right. - Good luck. - Thank you. All right, man. Cool. Well, have fun. I love you lots, OK? Bye. - Hi. - Hey... hi. - How long have you been in the door? - "Love you, man. Have fun. Bye." - That's it? - Hm-hmm. - Cool. - Great. Great. Great, um... I'm gonna let you know right now that it's totally cool to love your brother, so... I know. It's OK. Don't worry. I tell my brother I love him every day. Well, that's good that you do that. Good. - Yeah. - Good for you. Uh... You're wearing the shirt. - Looks great. Looks fine. - Safety Buddies. I feel naked right now, so I'm... - I'm gonna get changed because... - OK. - I'll go. - I'll put mine on now. - OK. - Cos I don't... - Hurry up. - This is not... Great. Bye. - OK. - Bye. Bye. Why are you an idiot? - For you. - Yup. Ooh, I'm scared. Why? Because your iPod's, like, the window to your soul? - Something like that. - Something like that. OK. Let's see what we got here. Oh, no. Where are you going? Celine, "My Heart Will Go On." - Yeah. - Absolute classic. - Kelly Clarkson, "Because of You." - Hm-hmm. That's a sad one. - Yeah. - John Mayer. Real dreamy. - He's handsome. I get it. - He really is. He's a handsome fella. Oh, Queen B. Wow. Look at those moves. Strong, independent woman... Love it. - This is a good playlist. I like it. - Oh, why, thank you. Oh-ho. What did you find? - ♪ You... - Oh. - Soulja Boy, "Crank That." - Well, of course. Ten bucks says that you have danced to this song in your room when nobody's looking. - Oh, and tell me you haven't. - I absolutely have. I got a lot of layers. - You gotta peel them back. - Oh, yeah? A bit of this, a bit of that. - What is that? - I have no idea at all. OK, OK... "Fairy-tale Wedding." Oh! I forgot that was on there. I'm gonna take that back. Yep. OK, I've obviously trespassed onto some childhood dreams? What? You're telling me that you've never had childhood dreams? Oh... So, what, does your boyfriend know about it? My who? That guy you were on the phone to before, what was his name? Billy or Boris? - Brad, Brad, Bradley. - Brad. - Bradley. - Brad. He is not my boyfriend. OK. I mean, I don't know, I think that we're dating. You think? He's got a lot going on right now and I'm finishing my senior year, so we're just keeping things... casual. - Casual? - Hm-hmm. OK. Are they your words or his words? What do you mean? You have a fairy-tale wedding playlist. So? What, you don't have sisters? I don't know, maybe it's a girl thing or a... me thing. I have a very healthy imagination, OK? Yeah, healthy imagination, sure, but I'm just saying, fairy-tale wedding playlist, boring Brad, do they really...? Oh... I'm just looking out for you. Gimme the phone, gimme the phone, gimme the phone. Hello. Safety Buddies. How can we get you home safely? Uh-huh. Sure, absolutely. We can be there. OK. OK, we'll see you there. Bye. Let's go! - Hold it in. - Just one second. It's OK. - Pull over. OK. All right. - OK. Oh, there you go, you're on all fours. - OK. - Hold her hair. Grab her hair. - Grab her hair. - Yeah. - OK. Look. - You're good. We made it to the curb. I'd say that's an accomplishment. OK! Yeah. OK. - Oh, you're so brave. Get it out. - I'm so sorry. - No, no. - No, you're so, so, so, so fine. It's good, just let it out. - Let it all out. There you go. - Take your time. I assume this is not casual Brad's idea of a great date night. Oh, no, OK. Get in the car. Let's get her some water. Oh! Safety Buddies. How can we get you home safely? Uh, yeah. Yeah. We're not too far from there. We'll see you in a second. This is totally legit of you guys to be doing this. My friends, they totally bailed on me, and it would have been a major bummer to crutch all the way home. Yeah, that would have sucked. No problem. So, uh... big night studying, huh? OK. All right. Nice. You know what? Let me take... No, please, please. I got it. It's OK. It's fine. I got it, I got it. Trust me. OK? Wow! No, yeah, just this way. I'm starving. Ooh. I could totally demolish some nuggets right now. OK. What do you say? - Sure. - All right. - To the nugs! - To the nugs. Let's go! You love this, don't you? What, watching people eat? No. Helping people. I mean, your whole face lights up when you do it. - It does? - Yeah, a hundred percent. Well, you seem to like it yourself. And you've actually been a really big help. I don't know, I'm just happy to be a part, honestly. So, what was, like, the deciding factor for you? I mean, what made you know that this was what you wanted to do? Uh... Well, um... there's actually a personal tie for me. I'll preface it with this. She's fine, thank God. But, um... Two years ago, my mom was almost killed in a car accident. She was driving to pick me and my brother up from the airport when some guy coming home from a late night crossed over the center divider and hit her head on. And she went into a coma and... we didn't know if she was gonna make it. We were sitting there waiting and it just felt like forever. And while praying for her to wake up, I made a deal with the big guy, that if she was OK, then I would do whatever I could to make sure other people stayed safe. And so, here we are. Wow. That's a, uh... That's a pretty deep layer, Sam. Hmm. I think she's beautiful. You two are beautiful. Surfer dude was right. It is beautiful when you find a cause that you're passionate about. - That's good. - Not in front of your face. - Over there? - I'm the safest-looking. Or that person that you're really into. What? I didn't know you were coming. How are you? - You're doing it. - OK. OK, go go, go, go! - Guinea... - Try this. Guinea pig? The person that lights you up and you would travel anywhere for. You don't need to take it on and off. I'm trying! The car takes itself where it wants to go, it's not me. That person that helps make life so much sweeter than it already is. The one that makes the ordinary extraordinary. And makes you do things you wouldn't normally do. And avoid some of the things that you're supposed to do. Dad. Three Cs and a D. You know, it's not actually what it looks like, because, um... Do you realize you're on the verge of flunking out of your first term? Flunking's a strong word. And don't even get me started on your phone bill. You... You were young and in love once, right, Dad? - Chris. - I'm just having fun, Dad. - Hey, I am serious. - So am I. It's responsible fun. Get your grades up, or no more support from us. - You hear me? - Yeah. Loud and clear. Got you. Papa. You wanted to see me? Sit. Jorge... What is going on with you? Flying all over the place. - Who is this American girl? - You know her name. - I don't think this is a good idea. - You don't think she's worthy? - Of course not. - She's a gringa, is that it? I never said that. - You don't approve. - Stop putting words in my mouth! So she's an American, so what? I went to Stanford. We live in Miami, for heaven's sake. Your health. Does she know? She knows. - Hi. - Morning. - Am I snoring? - No. Am I? I love you. What? I love every ounce of you. Me too. You know, I've been doing a lot of thinking. And I want to spend more time together. I just wish we lived in the same city. I mean a lot more time. - What is that? - What? What is it? - Will you marry me? - Oh, my goodness. Be my wife? - What about your father and your... - No, this is about us. I love you. I don't see my life without you. So, please marry me. Oh, my goodness. I love you so much. Yes. What do you think of this? "Dear Dad, I want to thank you and Mom for giving me the chance to come back and give it another shot. I feel like I'm finally getting this college thing right and I'm taking full advantage of this opportunity." Miss. Miss, hi. "I'm so thankful for how patient you both have been over the years..." "...and that I have parents who believe in me even when I didn't believe in myself." Hmm. "Thank you so much for all of this." "I love you. Chris." This is code for the new girlfriend, isn't it? - Probably. - Yeah. You did good. OK, Just Sam, it's the moment of truth. Yep. It's a big moment. You ready? Kind of nervous. Organ donor? Yeah. Why not? I'm not gonna need it when I'm gone, right? Yeah, I guess not. Mr. Chris Gregory. - That's you. - That's me. Yes. One second. - One second, I'm sorry. - What are you doing? If I pass, you have to go on a date with me. - What? - Just say yes. Please. Please. - Uh, yes. - Yes, yes. - Yes, yes! - Yes? - Yes! - Lovely. Yes. - Wow. You really went all out, huh? - Yeah. I don't know, I figure we got a lot to celebrate. - My newfound freedom. - Hm-hmm. - Your almost graduation. - Yeah. The fact that this is our first official date. Yeah, I guess you're right. The celebrations do warrant the effort. - Yeah. Of course they do. - Hm-hmm. So, what are you going to do with your newfound liberation? You know what? I think I'm... I'm going to enjoy this date with you. I mean, in life. Oh. Like, you know, have you thought about it? - About what? - Life. - Oh. Life. - You know, like future life. Oh. No, absolutely not. - Chris, seriously. - What? Seriously. Have you thought about it? I don't know, I just, um... I like living in this moment here with you. I don't wanna think ahead or behind, you know? Yeah, I guess. I do really like helping people. I like seeing people happy. It makes me happy, so... maybe something along the lines of that. - You know. - Hm-hmm. Use these good looks and charm to save the world. Wow. My mom's studying to be a nurse, but... She's like... a really special person. I don't really think that I've got what it takes, you know, to help people. I mean, I definitely can't save somebody's life. I don't know. You've been a pretty amazing Safety Buddy. - Oh. - Hm-hmm. Is that so? Amazing? - Yeah. - I'm amazing. Chris Gregory's amazing. I mean, it comes very naturally to you. Oh. So I'm a natural. - I'm naturally amazing. - Oh. - I'm naturally amazing. - Oh, my gosh. You are so annoying. I'm not! This is going better than I thought it was going to go. - My gosh. Shut up. - This is great for me. This is going so well that you might have to meet my family when they come for the Easter break. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Whoo! - There it is! - Get it, get it! - Wow. - What is... What's happening? Oh, my gosh. - What is happening? - Whoo! I miss my boys! Oh, you mean you miss Chris and I dominating John and Dad? I wouldn't be too quick to say that, Col. All right, got Old Man Winkle. - I got Dad, I got Dad. - Someone's gonna get hurt! Are you sure you can handle this? I have a brother. No, I mean Chris. He can be a handful. Hmm, I think I can handle it. - You. Man, what's going on with you? - Looking thin. By the way, guys, uh, take a look at this. What is that? Oh! You wanna see it? OK, I'm sorry. Look, read it... and weep. - Wow, only took you three years. - Thank you. His girlfriend was a big motivation. I mean, and I even survived all the lessons, so... Oh, thanks. Thank you. - I'm impressed. - Congratulations. - That's great. - How many times did it take? - Actually, once. - Let's eat. Come on. "How many times did it take?" "It took him three times." "How many times did it take to get your license, Chris?" Behave yourself, OK? - Yeah, of course. Always. - I love you. - This is for you. - What is this? - It's a little... - What? No. - Take it. - I don't need your money. Thanks, Mom. Mommy. - Love you. - Love you, too. - Take care of your brother. - I'll try. Drive safely. There you go. I love you. - Bye. - Bye. Lovely meeting you. Thank you. Thanks for everything, Pop. I love you. - Keep your grades up. - Yeah. Hear that? - Have fun. - Yes. - Not too much fun. - Of course not. - Be good. - Always. Bye. I love you. - I love you more. - Love you. - Bye. - Oh, my gosh! Wait! Come back! Don't leave me! That was a very good day. I, Jorge Bolivar... I, Leslie Folk... ...take you, Leslie Folk... ...take you, Jorge Bolivar... ...to be my lawfully wedded wife... ...to be my lawfully wedded husband... ...for better or for worse... ...for better or for worse... ...in sickness and in health... ...in sickness and in health... ...as long as we both shall live. ...as long as we both shall live. My wife? My husband. Cheers. What a day, right? - It was bliss. - Yeah. I'm sorry your parents weren't here. No. Don't be. We don't need the drama. Today was about us and our life together. They'll fall in love with you just like I did. Do you promise? I promise. My little peanut. OK. OK. You're doing this? I think it's about time we start working on those dozens of babies you've been talking about. Whoo! How did I get to be this lucky, huh? Whoo! You're almost getting out of here, Sam. - Yeah. - Got any plans after graduation? Probably intern at this nonprofit that I like. Yeah, that's right, my girl's smart. - Any of that rub off on you? - Ho-ho! Yes, actually. I'm thinking about signing up for the fire department. - You just wanna play with the siren. - Yeah, one hundred percent. Have you heard that thing? Whoo-ooh! And then hopefully some traveling at some point, right? - Yeah, traveling would be real nice. - Hm-hmm. - I can see it. - Whoa! Blue ocean, me and you, a yacht just like this. I'm standing here and you're holding me across my chest and there's all these tropical fish and... all this amazing... Ignore him. He does this way too often. Chris, dude, cut it out. Yeah, Chris. - Chris! - Chris, the joke is over. Why isn't he stopping? Chris? What's happening? - Chris! - Hey! - Chris! - Chris! Wake up, Chris! - Come on, hey! - Stop kidding around! Oh, God. Hey, go grab your car! Go get your car! Come on, big guy. Come on, stay with us. OK, come on. Chris! Chris. No! Doctor. The MRI shows bleeding in the frontal lobe of your son's brain. There is no sign of trauma, so it's possible he may have some type of aneurism or a bleeding arterial venous malformation. Please. Please don't leave me. I love you so much. Please. Please come back to me. Sam. Chris? Chris? John. John. Chris? You guys. - Hey. - Chris. Are you good? I've never felt better, actually. And that's saying something. Yeah, he's better, all right. We thought we lost you. I had this dream that I was this caterpillar trapped in a cocoon. It was really, really dark inside. I kept scratching the cocoon, trying to get out, but I couldn't get out. It was like I was stuck, like I couldn't move my body. I was so scared. I didn't think that I was gonna make it home. Then I heard your voice. I started to see like a... like a light, and I started to see this way out. And then... I realized that I was more than I ever thought I was... That I was like this beautiful butterfly. And I could just fly. Was there a little dog named Toto there, too? A wicked witch? Yeah. Yeah, there was. And the witch was your wife. Hey, your brother just got out of a coma. Don't beat him up. Well, I'm just glad that you didn't fly away. Me too. Careful, careful. Because there's actually something that I wanted to ask you. - Hi. - Hi. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness this man, Christopher, marry this woman, Sam, in holy matrimony. You look amazing. You, too. Chris. Oh, um... I, Chris, take you, Sam, to be my lawfully wedded wife. And I, Sam, take you, Chris, to be my husband. To have and to hold, this day forward... ...as long as we both shall live. By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Chris, you may kiss your bride. Just like that, the future life Sam talked about began to come into focus. It wasn't all that different from the life that Jorge and Leslie were living years before. Moving together by similarity, separated by time. Straight away. Close the door. Home, sweet home. - I got it. - You got it? Home, sweet home, look at it. Nice, huh? The kitchen. - Hm-hmm. - Like it? - I do. - Hm-hmm? Hm-hmm. You know, there are a couple of empty rooms to fill. But there were some differences in how our lives played out. Painful differences. Did you get the job? Oh, I knew you would. I'm so proud of you. - Thank you, thank you. - Aw! - You like the shirt? - Yes. It's a nice shirt. - All right? - Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna be making the big bucks now, so we can make a couple of changes around here. Maybe starting with a shower I can actually fit in. Actually, I think the first thing we should do is put some paint in that front bedroom. OK. Yeah, what color? Daddy. Dad? - Hm-hmm. - Me? - Hm-hmm. - No. - Hm-hmm. - No. - Yeah. - No. - No, you're lying. - Yes. Yes! Yes? Oh! - What? - Yes. No, I can't. Wow. Wow, wow, wow. - You...? - Hm-hmm. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. It's crazy. - I love you. - I love you. - Is that its... - No. No, that's the umbilical cord. Yeah, of course it is. I received your results and I reviewed them, and I wish I could give you better news, but... given your medical history, we're not very optimistic. I'm sorry. OK. Well, thank you for your time. You know, it's my fault. You never should have married me. We don't know that. I can't give you what you want. I can't give you what you deserve. No, my love. You said you wanted a big family. With dozens and dozens. Dozens of babies. I failed you. Listen to me. You're my family. You're all I ever wanted and you're all I need. You're the best thing that ever happened to me. And I wouldn't change any of it. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Everyone grab your bolster and find a comfortable seat. Now let's close our eyes, put our hands on our bellies, and visualize the connection to the life within. Tío! Tío! He's getting worse, isn't he? We want to make the most of every moment. To the Aliento de Vida. The Breath of Life. We're gonna take off. Thank you, guys, for coming. He's so perfect. I love you so much. Hi. Is that Mom? OK, we should really go back to shore. No. Listen, we want you feeling well, my love. No. No, I don't want anybody worrying about me. Tío! Tío, come in! Oh! Jorge! No. Check his oxygen. OK, I got you. Uncle Jorge's gonna be OK. It's OK. It's OK. I have been in touch with the Mayo Clinic. I'm making arrangements for you to be screened for a transplant. A transplant? Without new lungs, I don't see him lasting another year, maybe not even another month. To qualify for the procedure, you need to be sick enough where you need it, which you clearly do, but healthy enough to survive the procedure. Well, that's good. I thought you were sleeping. Too many thoughts. You should be in bed, my love. I have something for you, Peanut. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday, dear Peanut... Shh! No, it's not for another month. ♪ Happy birthday ♪ To you Peanut. In case, hmm? Shh! Shh! - Get it, buddy! - Yay! - What is it? - What is it? Is that a truck? It's a fire truck. Thank you, Uncle Colin and Uncle John. Hello? Yes. Dr. Keller? Tonight? Oh, yes, yes, I can arrange that. All right, well, I'll call you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, my Lord. You're not gonna believe this. They have a donor for you. Jorge, are you all right? Because we need to get you to the clinic as soon as possible. Come here. I've lived a good life, haven't I? What are you saying? This doesn't make any sense. Should go to someone younger. Just, please, stop. Someone more deserving. I love my life. I've been blessed and had so... I've had so much. I've had you, my family. Maybe we should go onto the Aliento, let whatever happens happen. My darling, this is your chance to finally breathe again. And I am right here by your side. But you will need to fight again. And if you don't fight for yourself, I need you to fight for me. We can do this. That's it, that's it. OK. - Great. - Thank you. So, Dr. Keller is on his way to get the lungs. You make it sound like the UPS delivery service. You know, this reminds me of the first time we met. I'd feel a lot better if you hold my hand. Always a charmer. It worked. I got you. You don't waste time, do you? I don't have time to waste. Not your first rodeo. No. Hopefully my last. This is as far as we can go. This will be right here when you get back. - OK. - You be brave. OK? OK. You be brave. Who are these people? Families of people waiting for transplants. They've got nowhere to go? No. - I hope it's not too hard. - OK. - Someone's home. - Daddy. You're looking at the new lieutenant. - Really? - Hm-hmm. - Do you hear that? - Daddy! - That's amazing! - Thank you. - Daddy! - Thank you. - Fire truck. - Yes. Wow! Look at this. This is art. - This is amazing. - It's not a fire truck. - It's not a fire truck, you're right. - I'm gonna go run his bath. OK. - I am so proud of you. - Thank you. This is fine. Hey? I wanna look at you. Oh! Come here. I love fire trucks. Yeah, I love fire trucks, too, huh? Don't you dare say it. I won't say it. - Say it. - Say it? - Yeah. - Fire truck. Oh! So, here's the thing. That's not what really happened. It would have been nice. Hmm, it would have been more than nice. Perfect wife. Perfect family. All I could ever want. And more. But it turns out life had something else in store for me. They ran every test you can imagine on me. CT, MRI, blood, oxygen levels, the works. And everything seemed to be fine. Except for one little thing. Doctor. The MRI shows bleeding in the frontal lobe of your son's brain. There is no sign of trauma, so it's possible he may have some type of aneurism or a bleeding arterial venous malformation. English, please. It's basically a leaking blood vessel. So, what's next? We're planning to drain some fluid and relieve the pressure on his brain. I don't understand. He was perfectly healthy. We just saw him last week. About two percent of the population have this kind of issue and never even know it. Even if it leaks, it's not necessarily fatal. - Most of the time, it isn't. - What do you mean, most of the time? He just looks like he's sleeping. We'll know more in the morning. In the meantime, you should all get some rest. There's a hotel down the street. Chris, listen to me. It's Dad. I love you, son. Now, put your hand in God's hand, OK? Put your hand in God's hand. - Good morning. - Good morning. We should talk. Christopher's condition has seriously deteriorated overnight. I'm afraid there's no other way to say this. This is death. We have to do one last test on him to verify that he is braindead. Then we will take him off all of the machines. I'm so sorry. Can we wait until his brother John gets here? Yes, of course. We can wait until you're ready. We can't actually allow for this. They're gonna give parts of him away. Like a junked car? - Honey. - No, I'm not OK with this. Mom, you can't agree to this, can you? It's what he wanted. Hey, big little brother. Usually, every time we're alone, you do most of the talking. I'm not used to this. Where's your wisecrack jokes when I need them, huh? I know I give you a hard time... most of the time. "Work harder, study stronger." What does it even matter now, huh? I am sorry... for so many things. You know, it's... You know, it's because I love you. Right? Chris... Look, I need you to hear me. I love you. And I'm proud... proud to be your big brother. Bye, buddy. Mr. Gregory, there are planes flying all over the country tonight because of your boy. We have matches for all the abdominal and thoracic organs. Heart, lungs, liver, pancreas, kidneys, and eyes. Your son is saving five lives. Will we, uh... Will we ever find out who they are? Maybe someday. Who knows? Maybe you'll get a letter. Maybe not. Sometimes folks write, sometimes families meet. It isn't easy. But it can happen. Only through the agency, though. No names or addresses are shared. Just general age, sex, and location. But... I wouldn't expect too much. They've all been fighting their own battles. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much for being here. My family and I appreciate your prayers for Chris. If there's anything you could do for us, it's, uh... it's this. Before you go to sleep tonight, please call someone you love and tell them. Call a friend. Or a relative you haven't talked to in a while. And don't ask them about their grades or their cellphone bill. Just tell them... how much you love them. Thank you all for coming. Thank you. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm... I'm alive. Who's... who's in here breathing for me? An angel. That's all we know. OK. OK. Yes. The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God. And no torment shall touch them. In the eyes of the foolish, they seem to have died, their departure thought to be an affliction and their going from us to be their destruction. But they are at peace. For though, in the sight of men, they were punished, their hope is full of immortality. I will always love you. Oh. The nurses are calling him Superman. No one can believe how well you're recovering. I feel half my age, Doctor. Who was he? I can't release that kind of information. We need to know. Please. I will check with the organ agency and see what they'll release. But I think we should get you home first. Thank you. You're welcome. It's handwritten, and, uh... they blacked out his name and his signature. Read it. "To whoever and his family. I understand I am the recipient of a gift from a relative of yours that is beyond repayment. I cannot imagine the grief caused by your loss and there are no words anyone can say or write to extinguish that pain. Nevertheless, you have shared with me the grandest gift I will ever receive. The gift of life." Grace. Honey, come here. What? Uh... They gave Christopher a name. What is it? Gabriel. The archangel of new life and incarnation. Our boy. Their angel. Gabriel. Gabriel was their 19-year-old son Christopher. He was in love with a girl named Sam. The parents lost their son and she lost her love. He was just a boy, you know. He was just a boy. Chris is here. He's with me. I'm going to take good care of him. Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Grace. Hi. Nice to meet you. Go ahead, take my eyes. They're no use to me now. But just know that when they look at some little children playing, I'll be smiling with them. Take my heart so someone else can live and love and... with this gift, know that my love remains in this world. Take my lungs so someone else can sing. And if you listen carefully, you'll hear that I'm singing with them. I'm sorry I didn't have more hugs to give and jokes to tell. I did my best to make others smile. And when I die, I won't be here. I'll be everywhere. So, that's my story. And it didn't happen the way any of us would have expected. But it was a miracle. Beautiful, awesome and fantastic.
