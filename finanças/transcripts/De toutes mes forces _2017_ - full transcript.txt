Time's up! Thank you. Bye! Have a nice weekend! -Bye! -Goodbye! -Let's go! -See you later! Don't be late! -Later, Serge! -OK! -Give me that! -Wait. -Give it to me! -Just wait! Where are you? On my way. What the hell? You don't need that! I'm coming back in two days. God! You're a pain in the ass! Go outside, for God's sake! Get some fresh air. Do something! How long have you been in here? Look, I did the shopping. I bought tons of stuff. I got some mangos, but don't let them go bad. Thanks, honey. -When will you be back? -Sunday evening. What day is it? -It's Friday, Mom. I was at school. -Come here. Will there be girls there? No, just my friends. You know I'm just teasing! Do you love me? I love you. Dammit! Are you serious? Damn right. I'm coming! No! Stop! Please! Can't do it? Be careful! What are you doing? -Watch out! -Just stop, dammit! Mom Hey, Nassim! -You scared? Sucker! -What do you mean? Tarzan has nothing on me! Stop it. It's his first time! Your mom finally let you come. It's about time. You're not 12 anymore. She just works a lot and wants me home on the weekend. You were great! Like a little squirrel. -Sacha! -It's coming loose. Stop messing around, dammit! Mom! Mom! DO IT RIGHT Nassim! Nassim, wait! Your mom's in heaven, please God. You know we can't take you in. But we'll always be there. I know it's hard. But now you're free from that hellhole. -Want a ride to your aunt's? -No. Always tell us where you are. Your social worker gave me your schedule. If you make new plans, play sports, or whatever, please let us know, so we can save you dinner. Do you understand? You're our responsibility now, Nassim. But most importantly, we're here to help. Whether it's Cédric, me, or the other caregivers. We're here to answer any questions you may have. OK, Nassim? Is that clear? It's me. I hope you're having fun, sweetheart! But please come home soon. I love you. It's me. I hope you're having fun, sweetheart! But please, come home soon. I love you. Aim for its head! Dammit! Look, I'm aiming for its head! Look, I'm spraying its head! -What's up, guys? -Hey, Nemo. -You good, José? -What's wrong? You on your period or what? What's up, bro? Pass the orange juice! Well, I'm waiting. -Kévin, have anything to say? -Me? Not this morning, anyway. You didn't kill José's fish, then? -They're dead? -Yes, they are! And there was fish for dinner! José had over four servings! One, two, three, four, five. Once I caught a fish alive... I'm kidding. I feel sorry for you, really. You'll all be sorry if no one comes forward. You'll all share your pocket money with José so he can replace his fish. But it wasn't even me! It's never you! Life is unfair, and so am I! And I love it! And I'm unfair to you, because I love punishing innocents! But we don't have much money! It's all your fault, faggot! Always playing the victim! He picks on the weak ones. -Shut up! Screw you! -Shut your face! Shut it! Who do you think you are? Be quiet! Shut up, it wasn't him! No, you shut up! Hey you, new boy! Come here! You're going to do me a favor. You'll admit to killing the fish. Understood? -I'll take the blame? -Do it and we'll protect you. -Dream on! -What are you doing? -Where are you going? -Let go! Son of a bitch! Don't leave when I'm talking! Look at me when I'm talking to you! Go on, go! Get out of here! You're looking for trouble. Next time you're getting it! I'll make you eat your own balls. You'll be out sick. Go on, get out! Hurry up. NORTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY It's me. I hope you're having fun, sweetheart! But please come home soon. I love you. How's it going? She said yes! Yeah, that's it! -What's up? -You never reply. Where were you? We asked the teacher but he didn't tell us. I had a good reason, man. -My mom died. -What? My mom died. That's it. Let's go. -Hello, everyone! -I didn't know. That's awful. I'm letting you know now I have work to hand back, and I'm not too impressed. Where are you living now? At my uncle's house in Boulogne. How's that going? Pretty good. He's always busy at work so I can do whatever I want. You wouldn't pick up the phone and I wanted to go to your house. I went to your street but didn't know the house number. I just stood there. Anyway, if you want to talk, I'm here. -Thanks. -Nassim, 5 out of 20. Maxime, 5 out of 20. -Really? -We got the same grade! -You've made no effort this week. And you're proud of it! Totally! I got a 4.5 out of 20 on the last test. I'm constantly improving! Your aunt called. Too little, too late. I know you and your mother didn't speak much to her but... How was it with the rest of the family? If you have something to say to her, now's your chance. Settle it. What do you have to lose? She's dead to me! Come in! -Yes, Cédric? -Gaetan's ready. We're leaving. Did you manage to get the reorientation report? The social worker called and said she'd send it to us. Sorry, Nassim. Does the mother know? It's a permanent expulsion. She already knows about the warnings he's received for theft, running away... She knows he's out of control. Will she be there for the handover? -She hasn't replied. -Well, keep me posted. What's this? It's your child welfare file. -My file? -You all have one. Anyway, about your aunt. You can always change your mind. My advice is not to close the door. If you need me, I'm here. What did I just say? -If I need anything, ask. -That's it! Hi. Hello, Nassim! Boulogne must be so far away. Yeah, but I don't really care. -Why? -My uncle's apartment is sick! By the way, you're invited to come skiing. With Marcus. The first week of Christmas break. -At Christmas? -Yep. -I can't. -You can't come? Got plans with my uncle. He already booked the flights. While you're freezing your asses off, I'll be in the sun, on the beach. I'm hot just thinking about it. It would've been awesome. I can't ditch him. He's being nice to me. Why not invite Louise? Are you free the first week of Christmas break? You're so annoying! I forgot something. See you later. Don't wait up. See you! Jerk! You're 20 minutes late, Nassim. Please, take a seat. As you know, we're here today to talk about your studies. -How long does it take to get here? -40 minutes. You can stay until the end of the year. But... Given your situation, and your grades, you'll need to think about vocational training, a specialization that'll let you finish high school. Any idea what you want to do? You could do an apprenticeship in a hotel and earn 65% of the minimum wage from the start. The sooner you make a decision, the sooner we'll find a school closer to you. What do you say? Any thoughts? Yeah. I need to pee. What are you doing? -We're done. -Have some respect. We're talking about your future, if you didn't know. -Take a look. -Screw your apprenticeships! Why can't I stay here? -You're failing. -I'm not the worst one. The equation is: SN = 1 + 2 + 3N. What is SN in relation to N? Look, I'm sorry. Math isn't my strong suit. Really? What is then? I guess you don't need math to take care of us misfits. The other workers won't be able to help any more than I can. -I guess I'm screwed then. -Find the answers online! Or ask Zawady. -Hi! -What? I have a math problem. And? -I just wondered if... -I'm busy. It's just one thing that I... You didn't forget your gel at least. -Come back in once piece. -I will. -Or I'll be jealous! -OK, OK. OK? Off you go. -Happy holidays! Bye, Stéphane! -Happy holidays! You too. -I'll miss you. -Thanks! No beer on the train! -OK? -OK! All right. Off you go! -Send my regards. -Thanks! I'll be here, too. Why? I only want to go for the day and come back. Sorry, you can't. -Please, Miss... -Where are you going? To my mom's house. You know you can't do that. You won't be alone. Nassim's here, and Kévin. You won't spend Christmas alone. You know what'll happen there! Please save me. -You can't stay here. -No, please! Come on! Hurry up and pack your bags! José. Come with me for five minutes. Bring your bag. -Mina, what time are you leaving? -10:00. -Clear the table while I pack. -Are you kidding me? Mina! Mina! God, she's a pain. Close the door! Move! What's the matter? Haven't you done it before? Mina! Mina, are you there? By the way, Merry Christmas! Here you go. Dinner is served. I'm starving! Damn! -Enjoy! -Thank you! What is this shit? It's foie gras. -What's that? -Foie gras. I've heard there are traces of pork in it. More like in your head! It's the ugly ogre! Looking at her is enough to make you cry. -Going on the computer? -Yeah. -Want some Yule log first? -No. What's she doing? Studying hard. She graduated with honors. Now she's studying to get into med school. It'll be hard, because you need a good score. GOOGLE IMAGE SEARCH Hi! I've been here and here. You're so far away! I'm on the computer. Get off! Sorry. No one was in here. Don't try and stop me! Get off me! Let me go. Your mom doesn't want to see you. Excited for the New Year's party? Totally! I'll be back then. -You're staying put! -No, I'm not! Your mom's sick. She's not well. She's too fragile right now. I'm gonna see her. Let me! Nassim! Where are you going? I'm going to buy more phone credit. -Hurry up! It's the party soon. -OK. I have something for you. It's a late Christmas present. Thanks! They're beautiful! Are they from El Kala? Kind of. Kind of? You remembered the town. Good evening! You're back early. We're allowed to have fun too. Where's the booze? -How are you, Marcus? -Good, thanks. -How are you, dear? -Good, thanks. Happy New Year! -You too! -Happy New Year! -See you soon! -OK. I'm leaving too. -Back to Boulogne? -Yes. -It's too late. Stay the night. -Thanks, but I have to go. It's too far away at this hour. I'll call your uncle. -That's OK. -Come on. -Happy New Year! -Bye! We haven't really had the chance to speak since... We didn't really know what was going on, except your mom was sick. You keep things so quiet. -Your mom had cancer, right? -Yes. And your uncle was there to help you out? No, I was all alone. But it's fine now. What's the matter? I think I drank too much too. I'll go. I don't want to get caught. It's me. I hope you're having fun, sweetheart! But please come home soon. I love you. I've informed Child Protection and your social worker. What is this? Some kind of prison? You think you can stop me from doing what I want? I'll remind you you're legally required to follow the house rules. If you'd spoken to your caregiver, we could've authorized it. We must know where you are. Do I need to ask to pee? All we're asking is that you obey the house rules. It's the same for everyone. Seeing as you won't cooperate, you're losing a week's pocket money. Sorry. I'm also confiscating your phone. I'll return it in a month. You mean this? Nassim, please. Hand it over. Let go of me! What do you want? Get off me! Let go of me, dammit! Get off me! OK. I'm calm. Nassim, it's simple. If you want to go out at night, you have to tell us. -Screw you! There's so much gossip in these magazines. Have you seen her? It's all nonsense. They all have stories to tell! -I'd have left him ages ago. -I'll do it. -Do what? -I'll help you with your math. Nassim's been caught by the ogre! She's going to eat him whole! If you help me study. I need more help than you. You'll help me first. Which transporter is involved in the resting membrane potential? -What's a resting membrane? -The Na+/K+ pump. Pump? -What's a pump? -Next! What's the average artery flow speed? -0.153 thousandth of a second. -No, that's not it. -0.151 thousandth of a second. Hurry up! Next! From which... You can't be in here. No boys in girls' rooms. What do you think... Come on! No point arguing. -What year are you? -A junior. Let me see. OK... Two questions are asked in a referendum. 65% vote "yes" to the first question, and 51% vote "yes" to the second. 46% answered "yes" to both. What's the probability of someone voting "yes" to either question? Start by writing the problem down. How much is P times A? P times A? Do you know or not? These aren't riddles. Oh, yeah! Oh, yes! What's my name? Think that's funny? Do you know or not? Yes, it's 65%. It's 0.65. -Yes, that's right. -So P times B equals 0.51. You're not a total idiot. 46% voted "yes" to both questions. How do you write that? Look at your paper! What are you reading? The War of the Worlds. Any good? If it wasn't, I wouldn't read it. What are you wearing? Got a cigarette? Want one? I don't smoke. I see. More into candy? Am I annoying you? Do you know a way out of here? Maybe. To see a girl? No, a friend. I'll tell you. But don't tell anyone! This way. I get it. You want out too. See those holes? -Yeah. -Use them to climb to the top. On the other side, you'll see a pole. You just slide down. To get back in, grab a trash can on the street and climb back over. What? Are you in school? As if! I can't stand school. So what do you do? I'd like to look after kids. But with all the shit in my file, I can't even intern. Why? The assholes here write down everything you do. It's there forever, like a tattoo. Look out. They're all smiles, but... You're right. They aren't the brightest. I'm here to raise the bar. You're full of yourself! -That's a girl's scarf! -Hands off! -So? -So, what? -Did you get the results back? -Yes. -And? -Correct. The aortic arch leads to... The common carotid artery and the right brachiocephalic artery. Correct. Which veins do not contain valves? The internal left carotid artery, the superior vena cava and kidney. -Correct. What are the deep veins? The sub-facial arteries. Don't say "correct." Just ask the next question. The azygos vein... Leads to the upper vena cava and drains into the torso veins. The azygos vein leads to... The thorax lining veins and the spinal veins. The portal vein leads to... -The stomach and spleen. -Go away! What do you want? -You're dead! -Shut up! Stay, bastard! He jacked off to a photo of Ryan's girlfriend. He jizzed all over it. Son of a bitch! Jacking off to my girlfriend? You bastard! Ryan, stop! -You're dead! -Come on, bastard! Who did you call a bastard? Stay there! Moussa! -Calm down, Moussa! -Let go of me! You asshole! Stop it! -Let go! -Asshole. Shit, Moussa! Let me see! -Get off me! -Come on. Let me see. He went crazy! I've got a new name for you: Picasso! Damn! -And the dance contest? -I'll get the car and go to the ER. It's your fault! What about the contest? I don't care. Come on, Moussa. Let's go. They've been talking about the Tobin tax since I was five. And in Mom's stomach? Actually, since 1972. For more than 40 years, dear. Why hasn't it been put in place yet? The government is reluctant to accept a tax that penalizes its own tax havens. So nothing will be done? We're useless. It's up to your generation now. So, Max... The future is in your hands! -Oh! -What? Maxime told me your uncle got you a math tutor. -Yes. -Any good? We need one for him. He's an engineering student. But he lives in Boulogne. I doubt he'd come all the way here. The food's great! Thank you! Your uncle works you but doesn't feed you! -You're one to talk! -No, leave it! -Can I try some? -Of course! -Here you are. -Thanks! It'll cost a fortune. Don't you remove the skin? No, I eat it. The skin is more nutritious. -Ah, of course! -Didn't you know? You eat the pit too? Sorry! I should've shown you how to eat it. Give him water or he'll choke! It's OK. Spit it out! Spit it out! Here. Drink this. Better? -PlayStation time. -Max, do you mind... -Come on, Nassim. -Don't forget your exam! Yeah, it's fine. Why are you saying that? I'm just saying... Still haven't got your phone back? No, but I will soon. I have an old one that still works. I can lend you it in the meantime. It's fine. It's being repaired. It's annoying that I can't reach you. -Just take it. -You're starting to bug me! I don't need your old phone! Why are you getting mad? Want Max to ask if you can stay the night? I wish. What about your parents? We'll just wait until they're asleep. No, I can't tonight. My uncle's waiting up for me. Can I stay at your uncle's? Yeah, but... I'd have to ask him first. He's a bit old-fashioned. Did Cédric rat me out? Why? Was he there? No, it wasn't Cédric And he doesn't work here anymore. Because of Moussa? It doesn't matter! We saw you jump the wall. I have to tell social services. I'm going to get the wall fixed and you're going to help. As for your phone, not just yet. What's with you, Nassim? Why don't you take part in life here? I'm nothing like the others here. Do you care? Get me in trouble! Write that in the file! Listen. You're smart, Nassim. Yep. I can't understand your behavior. Maybe I'm wrong. -Can I read it? -What? Your file? Only caregivers are allowed to. -It's an official document. But ask. -Why can't I read it? If I'm so smart, I can read it by myself, right? Stop! Don't get carried away. You just can't get your head around the house rules. We've found you a center nearby for next year. -What? -It'll be for the best. I know I messed up. I promise it won't happen again! I don't trust you. But I'm working my ass off! Please don't do this. Behave, and we'll see. Woohoo! Mrs. Cousin! Moussa crushed it! He was amazing! -Congratulations, Moussa! -Thanks, Mrs. Cousin! Pat it down a bit more. That's what I'm doing. -He's messing up your plan. -What a pain in the ass. Hey, man! What's up? I need a favor. I need to borrow a pair of socks. -And the shirt I lent you last time? -It's dirty right now. When are you giving it back? Don't you ever do laundry? I need to tell you something. Before I was here, I was a mess. I did 3 months in juvenile detention for stupid stuff. But thanks to Izis, I'm moving in the right direction. Once I'm old enough to leave, I'll live with her parents. And once I'm paid, I'll get married for sure! 100 guests, a party. -It'll be insane! -That's great, but I need to work. Seriously? -What are you doing? -It's my only clean pair. You mean you only have one pair of socks? Do you want them or not? Fine! Take this, dude. For your services. I don't want your drugs. It's some amazing stuff, perfect for special occasions. Try it and let me know! See you later! Get out of here! You don't know me. Don't talk to me like that! What do you want? You posh bitch! Get out of here! Where is he? -Where is he? -Get out! There he is! He sees you! He doesn't care. Get out! Get the hell out of here! He doesn't even want to see you. Just go. -Give him this. -Take your damn book and get out! -Who's that bitch? -Shut up! Why are you bringing girls here? -I said shut up! -Let go of me! Bastard! Nassim! I'm sorry I came to the home. I was mad you'd lied to me. -But then I realized. -What did you realize? -Why didn't you tell me? -Shut up! Happy? Is this what you wanted? You're talking nonsense. -Pity me? -That's not it. Yes, it is. I'm talking to your sister. Go away. You're crazy. I'm crazy and you can kiss my ass! What are you looking at? -No one cares! -Really! -Calm down! -Get your hands off me! Go home to Mommy and Daddy and eat off your silver plates! -You're nuts. Get help. -What? No! Stop it! What's going on here? What's going on, Nassim? You're not yourself. I'm not going to say anything to your home because you've never done anything like this. I spoke to your classmate. She forgives you. So this ends here. Don't do it again! You can go. Don't talk to me about that! I thought I'd do it when I retired. Nassim! Nassim! Now you're giving me the cold shoulder? Is that a new thing? You and Zawady have been working hard. I'm pleased. Benjamin said the wall was tough but you're making progress now. -How's it going with him? -Fine. What's that face for? Nassim! I live for the day you'll finally trust me! Here. Have this. Thank you. Mom, Mom! What is it? How long have you been in here? Let's study. -I quit! -You quit what? I quit. It's over. No more studying. I'm warning you. There won't be a second chance! So? I'm leaving school. I'm not surprised. Slacker! Whenever it's hard, you give up. Look at you! In this pigsty. If you don't want to end up like them, step up! -Leave me alone! Go away! -I can't fail. -I won't be helping you again! -Get out! Don't speak to me ever again! Go! Yes, Moussa! Go, Moussa! No! Are you hurt? Nora, let's go. It stinks in here! Why did she say that? Did you have sex? -I'm talking to you! -Drop it. Moussa's moves were sick. I liked them. Especially when he pretended to fall and then he jumped back up. A great ploy! Ploy? That's not his name! Ploy! It's not a name. It's a word. It's when you trick someone. -What are you talking about? -Listen! A ploy is a kind of escape. When you're in trouble and you find a way out of it. Like when you wanted me to go down instead of you to keep your money. That's not a ploy. It's an alibi. It's both. Did you understand that? I'm starving! Have some of this, man! -What's in this? -Don't ask me! Nassim! Come and get your pocket money! 100 euros. Please sign here and count it. I'd never scam you. I'll count it five times! You never know! Kévin and the others are going to buy clothes. You should go. They know all the best deals. OK. If you were older and smarter, I'd marry you! For the finals, you need to give it your all! Create some new material, something unique. Think about it! I found a new name. Tchintongo! Sound good? Yeah, better than Winnie the Pooh. -Shut up! -Do these jeans look OK? -They look good. -That shirt is awful! -It's hurting my eyes! What do you think you look like? It's called fashion sense. What do you think? They look good. Get them! OK, I'll take them. Better than the old ones. What do you mean? Got a problem? That's 109 euros, please. Can you do any better? I really can't, I'm sorry. Please, sir! We're buying so much. If everyone asked for a deal... If I gave every customer a discount, I'd go out of business. -Please, sir! -No, I really can't. -95 euros? -No, they're not some Chinese brand. They're American. I can't go that cheap. No way. How about 105 euros instead of 109? -A 4-euro discount? -4 euros is a lot! We'll bring in our friends. You'll make a fortune! OK, fine. 95 euros! You'll have to work it out between yourselves. 100 and 5. Work out whose it is. I'm keeping the 5 euros you owe me. How much is his jacket? You owe me 25! -How much do you owe me? -Wait. It's 25 minus the discount! It's his change! No, it's his! -He didn't say yes. -He's giving everyone a discount! He gets it and I don't? -We'll take them, sir! -You're crazy! It's for everyone! Yes, it's for everyone. I'm the one paying! He's the one who went first. Who did you give the discount to? Is it off the total? The discount is for everyone! I'm the one who bargained! -How much is that? -The new one is 34 euros. -No, the one next to it. -The red one? -Yeah. -That's the price! 34 euros. -Grab me the one at the end. -The one at the end? -Which one? -Wait, let me think. The other one on the end. This way! Mrs. Da Silva! José! I'm sorry. Let's go study. -The cervical vertebrae is rigid. -True. A vinculum is... A connection between a tendon and the underlying bone. What's under the distal epiphyses lateral epicondyle of the femur? The popliteus muscle and the soleus muscle. The third one isn't on here. -The whatever muscle... -They're old, incomplete flashcards. Can you please turn down the volume? Hello! Hurry up! Today we're looking at average and median. We'll calculate average salary of a company's employees. Average and Median On one side, we have the monthly salary in euros. Intrinsic: an essential characteristic of something. I'm pregnant -Where's Mina? -Dunno. -Haven't you seen her? -No. What's this crap? -I'm asking a question! -It's not crap. I'm pregnant. -Calm down. No point... -Don't touch me! -Calm down! -That's easy for you to say! -Calm down! -Let go of me! What's that? Don't tell anyone. If you tell anyone, I'll kill you. If you wanted to hide it, you shouldn't have left it. If you tell, I'll kill myself. I won't tell your mom. But you won't be able to hide it long. -Unless... -I'll keep it! That's your decision. But I'll book a family planning appointment for you. -Nassim can go with you. -No way! She said she was on the pill. -Screw you! -Screw you! Let's find a solution. Mina! -Nassim, I'm going to have to... -Go on then! Write it down! You love it! Write your bullshit in my file. Where's Mina? She went to Belgium with her mom. It was too late to abort in France. When she's back, I hope you won't send her back, if you get my drift. Can I call her? Give her some space. Her mom's there for her. She told me she'd slept with other people as well as you. Do you like chocolate? Take this Easter egg. -Thanks. -Let this be a lesson. Who's getting it now? Hey! What do you want? Am I invisible? Am I invisible? Listen to me! -Why are you acting crazy? -What's the problem? He stole my phone. It's not fair. You're pissing me off! -I don't care! -Would you... MURDER CONVICTION ACCUSED OF RAPING STEPDAUGHTER IN CUSTODY AWAITING TRIAL IDENTITY DISORDER SELF-HARM RISK RISK PREVENTION AND SEX THERAPY NEEDED I have a question to ask. Fire away. What's written about my mom? About her death. Your mother died because she was taking too much medication. I know. Before I left, I gave her a bigger dose than normal. Was it accidental or on purpose? Your mother was on a long path of self-destruction. You shouldn't feel guilty for what happened. When I got back and found her, why did they just put me in here without telling me why? Why is it so hard to say? -Suicide. -It's not that simple. If not suicide, what was it? Given her poor health and the doses of sleeping pills and antidepressants she was taking, it could've happened at any time. Sometimes, the people who love us but can't cope with life anymore wait until we're not there to take their life. Not her. She didn't want me to go. It will get easier for you. Why'd you do this to me? Why leave me in the dark? Why leave me guessing? Did you want to see me suffer forever? I should've opened the windows wide, to let the cockroaches and all the grime out, the death and sadness. I should've thrown your pills out, stopped you from becoming a useless beggar, a poor junkie reeking of death. Time for the final push! Lymphatic system. Baudelaire turns into an angel with wild eyes to join his loved one. This is a frightening image, not a common look for an angel, but instead rather somber. Baudelaire declares his love but a distant kind of love, like that of a ghost, or cold like death. The wild eyes are like a wolf's, protective like a she-wolf but as dangerous as a pack of them. The last verse makes it feel like the poet's loved one is in danger, as he doesn't love tenderly but reigns with terror. Could you read us the last three lines? Others by tenderness Would reign over your life and youth, But I will rule by fear. I think that Baudelaire wants us to feel the awful sadness of absent love. When he says, "But I would rule by fear," he's telling us that his love will torment his lover. So... Aurélien, no effort. You'll have to change groups. Camille, great improvement! Well done. Maxime, it was close. But you passed. Nassim, big improvement. Well done. You passed. Marcus, where are you? -Well done, man! -Thanks. You too. Want to grab a drink to celebrate? Sorry, I can't. Next time. You won't get rid of me that easily. Ready for the French final? No, not at all. See you. Yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah! Go! You're crushing it! Your new name is so good! You're the best, man! Let's go! Come on! Grab my bag! See ya! Good luck, man! We got this! Yeah, man! And the winner is... Well done, Moussa! -We're proud. -Thanks, Mrs. Cousin! We should also congratulate Brahim, who's been his right-hand man for weeks now. Well done! Well done, Brahim! -Well done, Brahim! -You know... Just did my job. Nothing special! Brahim! Zawa, it's me! Come celebrate with us! Zawa! -What is it? -Get out! What's up? Did you get your score? Did you fail your exam? Go away, Nassim! I'll be back. Wait! She was close, but sadly, not good enough to go on to the second year. She's now an adult. Social services can't fund nine years of school. We can pay for you until you're 18, or 21 in rare cases. We told her do a shorter program: PT, dentist. She said no. -So she won't be a doctor? No. Let's be realistic. It's not up to me. She's been studying like crazy! That's how it is. You have to make do. She's brilliant. She'll do something. You're disgusting! You make me sick! OK then! Let's go! Oh, no! Get Mrs. Cousin! Let go of me! Get off me! Let go! Calm down! -What are you doing, Nassim? -Let go! Let go! Know what, Arthur? Screw you! Kévin, I've caught you! I recognize that hyena laugh. Damn, your face! You're really smashed! Can we go to your room? No, let's go to Ryan's. He's not there. What the hell? Weren't you at your girlfriend's? Girlfriend? I'm done with her. -Done? -You mean Izis? Give him some. -Drink! -Not too much! Go on, drink! Be careful! Drink! I warned you! Look at her face! You can tell she's a ho. Look in those eyes. Bros before hos! -You look like a tomato! -Every time I drink, weird things happen to my face. -Want me to play a sick song? Get up! Get up! Get up! All we wanted was a million euros But nothing ever goes like you expect Yesterday you called him "my brother" And this morning you shot him NRV NRV NRV NRV NRV Your ass is NRV My new shoes are NRV Paris is NRV NRV, NRV, NRV The kids on the train are NRV Adults chased down by the gang squad NRV, NRV, NRV, NRV Everything about our stupid life is written in there. Every little detail is in there: when you stopped wetting the bed, if your mom smashed your face in with the vacuum cleaner when she was drunk on Chivas. What about you? Did your dad "sodosize" you? "Sodosize!" No. He doesn't even know me. He left as soon as he found out. What a bastard! That's out of order. My mom got messed up working late in bars. First it was heroin, then pills. -What are you doing? -Give me your lighter! Give me your lighter! I get it. Let me do it! Don't be stingy. Give it! Whoa! You see that? I did it, man! -Give me the lighter! -It's mine! Hands off! Give it to me! Stop messing around! Give me the lighter! There's a fire! We have to get out! It's on fire! What are you doing? Get out! Can you hear me? Nassim! Are you there? Nassim! Given the prosecutor's request and the seriousness of the crime, arson, to be exact, which you participated in instigating... Nassim Kali! ...and due to a number of complaints made to your social worker, you will be immediately discharged from the La Motte residence. You will be transferred under court supervision to the Yvan Mornas foster home in Marcq-en-Barœul, which will take over your care as soon as you leave today. I hope you all realize you've gotten off lightly. I brought you a few. You can't say you don't have what you need to study now! I knew you couldn't be that much of a superhuman. It's impossible. So you had a slip-up. We've all been there. I know why you did it. You wanted to learn first-hand. Great idea! You're in the best place to study! No way! Are you smiling? I've never seen you smile! But don't smile too much. Stay superhuman. You'll need it. I won't hear any nonsense. You're going to bounce back and get studying again! The caregiver's coming in an hour to take you to your new home. Happy now? Anyway, I've only got a few weeks left here. Why do I even care? Mina... You two are in trouble. Especially you, Ryan. House arrest. Too bad for you. Screw you! You people always get away with it. You're too smart. Nassim, are you ready? The caregiver's here. Souleymane's taking Ryan. See you, bro. Good luck! Take that thing off! It's ugly! -See ya, junkie! -See ya, pretty boy! -See ya, dude! -See ya! Take care! Bye, buddy! Let's take a photo. Could you take it? Mom, you were like me, and I'm like how you were. Why did your body break? Why did your heart break? Why did you break me? You took a part of me with you, and I'll take part of you with me. This part will never die. As long as I live, you can never die.
