What about uh, test answers? No, I don't give my studentsthose kind of tests. Did you see any part ofthe intruder? A pant leg or a shoe? No, I didn't. What about security cameras? Not inside, but honestly Travis, there's nothing to steal. Alright, I'm calling campussecurity tomorrow. I'm gonna have them installcameras in the hallway, definitely one in your office. Claire, will you call forensics? I'd like them to come downhere and sweep everything. Got it. Thank you. Uh, well, why don't yougo home? Get some sleep? Uh, actually I was thinkingmaybe I'd stay if you don't mind? No, I don't mind. It's gonna be a long night. Are you trying to get rid of me? No. In fact, I appreciateyou calling me. Well, it was a crime, so that... I just figured... Since, you know, in the pastwhen there's been a crime you... I have not called you. Yeah. Come on. I still can't figure it out. What would they wantin my office? Yeah, I don't know. Question for you. Do you usually come this lateon Sundays? Not usually but we've got thisMurder We Wrote book festival that my departmentis co-sponsoring so I've just beena little behind. So maybe you surprised thembefore they found what they were looking for. I just still can't figure outwhat that would be. You know? Yeah. Oh, uh, by the way, are youstill good for tomorrow? Absolutely. Mystery 101? Yes. I wouldn't miss itfor the world. You look- Exhausted? Yeah. I know. Can I have a shot ofespresso in my coffee? Of course. I was up all nightwith Travis. Oh! Oh, no, no, no. To clarify, my office gotbroken into and he actually cameto help me. What happened? I interrupted them and then theyknocked me down and ran off. Amy! I'm fine. Look at me, I'm fine. Does your dad know? No, no, and he's notgoing to know. I am fine, ok? He needs to focuson the festival. Ok. Amy. Betsy. Look at you. You look so grown up. Well, that's 'cause I am. Uh, Holly, this is- Betsy Crane. The original publisher ofthe Atticus Keller books. Holly Chen. The original ownerof Holly's Cafe. Well, I'm here forthe book festival, obviously. What would you like? Oh, half caff oat milk latte with a splash of vanillawould be lovely. Coming up. Come, come. Sit. You can give me a previewof the festival. Oh. The festival, huh? Mmmhmm. Well, um, oh, look. I'm just going to be honestwith you. If you want to talk to my dad you should just probablydo it directly. What makes you think- Because the car keys thatyou're putting in your purse are from Avex Rental, and this morning when I walkedout of my house there was an Avex Rental carparked across the street which followed me here. Now I can only assume thatyou thought it would be best to bump into me rather thanto actually knock on my door. I... And the only reason youwant to talk to me isto get to my dad. You're very clever. - Ok.-This is my treat. Uh, thank you. Thanks. Please, forgive my sillylittle subterfuge. Oh, nothing to forgive. Have a nice day. You too. Can I help you? Ah, Phil Jenk, Reno Police. You're a long wayfrom your jurisdiction. I'm looking for Graham Winslow. This is his office, yeah? Not for about 10 years. I'm his daughter. Ah, Annie? Amy. Amy. Right. About 16 years agoyour dad interviewed me for a bunch of days backwhen he was writing "One Armed Banditos". Ok, Reno PD, I get it now. Yeah, well I'm herefor the book festival. I got a new book ideal'm shopping and I wanted to connect withGraham but his number's changed. Well, if you give me your numberl can pass it along. There you go. Jenk Security. Yeah. Side business. College tuition ain't cheap. Oh, don't I know it? Alright, well I'll get thisto my dad. Enjoy the festival. So you're saying I'm wrong? No, I'm just saying thatwe view things differently. Isn't that the same thingas saying I'm wrong? I mean, that's one wayof looking at it. The other way is sayingthat I'm right. Alright, well the point ofinviting Detective Burkehere today was to better understandpoint of view in fiction. More importantly in crimefiction where the perspective of the detective is everything. And what drives every whodunitis the question of whois solving the mystery. But in the real world as a copl don't have that luxury. You know, if I'm going on who, you know, that could be basedin prejudice. Maybe I like the personso I'm gonna rule them out. Maybe the opposite's true. Either way, I'm wasting timeto get to the right arrest. I gotta followthe hard evidence, so the first questionthat we ask... is what. If I do that, the what, well, that's gonna lead me to the who. I mean, I think that'sthe main difference between how I'm thinkingas a detective and how you guysmight be thinking as crime fiction readers. Detective Burke underscoresa key point that we've discussed before. The best mystery writing reallyis just a search for identity, not just of the killerbut also of the investigator. Yeah, but who I am doesn'tmatter as much as how we find the evidence. Are you sure about that? I'm pretty sure. Alright. Ok, we're gonna leaveit there. But I do wanna thank DetectiveBurke for coming in today and sharing his point of view. Ok, guys. I also want to remind youthat Elmstead is hosting the Murder We Wrotemystery book festival. It starts on Wednesdayand I hope you've got your tickets to see ProfessorEmeritus Graham Winslow. AKA her dad. Yes, my father. Ok? Have a great day. Thank you. I do ok? People applauded. What does that tell ya? Ah, you know, I guess I justwanna-you know, I wanted to hear youcompliment me. Ahh... You did a really good job. You did. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, you wanna grabsome lunch? Oh, yeah, lunch sounds great, actually. I'm starving. I totally missed breakfast. Hey, you did great, by the way, T-Man. Thanks. Hey, listen, Bud, I know thatyour name is a nick name and I appreciate thatbut mine doesn't have to be. I'll keep working on it. Amy. Hey, Tabby. Detective. Hi, Professor Felton, how are you? Tabitha, please. Nice to see you, too. We have a potential crisiswith Murder We Wrote. Can we talk? Yeah. Take a rain cheque? Yeah. Ok. Hey, uh, so Claire'sbeen wanting to try thisnew barbecue place. You should take her there, Bud. You should take her there. I've got the final report of allthe writers and publishers who rented boothsat the festival and... Rick Fitch? Does my dad know? Nope. That's why I'm talking to you, so you can talk to Graham. Oh, you want me to tell my dadthat his literary nemesis is invading the hallowed groundsof Elmstead College? Ok, literary nemesisis a little over the top, don't you think? Rick Fitch hasn't hada bestseller in 10 years and your father is a featuredspeaker at a sold-out session. They're hardly competitors. It'll be better if it comesfrom you. Talk to your dad? Ok. Bye. Mmmhmm. Are you serious? Dad, it's just a booth. I mean, the guy hasn'tpublished in- Three years. Yes, I know. So why is he doinga book festival? And not just any festival, this one. In my hometown. Well, apparently they'rereprinting his first book. Huh. The one he stole from me. Well, in other great news, Betsy Crane's in town. Yeah, she stopped methis morning. What is she doing here? Well, dad, it's a book festival. She's a publisher. She's Rick's publisher. She signed him a coupleyears ago. She is the one who is reprintingthe book. Hmm. Well then, there you go. Oh, there's this guy lookingfor you. His name is um... Phil Jenk? I don't know. He wants to talk to youabout some book idea he has? Oh, for Pete's sake! I never wanted to do thisfestival in the first place. Dale never made me doany of these things. Well, Dad, unfortunatelyDale is retired, ok? And your new book editor, what's her name? Celia Bunton. Ok, Celia says that she thinks it'd be good if you expandyour market. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's publisher speakfor selling out. She wants to turn the AtticusKeller books into movies. "Blockbuster potential" is the exact quote. And how is that a bad thing? You know what? I'm-I'm-I'm backingout of this. No, you are not. Dad, your sessionis sold out. You cannot back out. I'll refund the money. Dad. As a matter of fact, I needto make certain that Miss Celia Bunton understandsthat the writer is in charge, not the editor, and if she doesn't understand I'll take the Atticus Kellerbooks to a new publisher. You're gonna tell her all that? I most certainly am. And as a matter of fact, she arrived this afternoon and we're having dinnerat Cafe Marion. Mmmm. Why don't you join us? - No.-Come on. Mmm-mmm. Come on. It'll be fun to watchyour old man tell the New York editorwhat's what. Do you know whatshe looks like? Nah, I have no idea. We've only ever emailed. What? You mean you've never actuallyspoken to her? Honey, you know I don't liketalking to editors. Oh dear. Does that mean I'm going to haveto do all the talking? Hello. I'm Celia Bunton. You are? Shall I show you my passport? - Hi.-Hi. Hi. And you must be Amy. Yeah, that would be Amy. She's my daughter. His daughter, right.Yeah. A pleasure. I have heard you teach the mostextraordinary class on crime fiction. Oh, well I don't knowabout extraordinary- No, no, no. Amy is taking itto a whole new level. Well, of course I knowyou created it, I have read your bioseveral times. Several. Wow. I'm-I'm honoured. I'm honoured. It's my job to know as muchas I can about my writers. Of course. Of course it is.Yeah. Developing a film is a lengthyprocess and at this point I agree with you, there'sno rush to turn Atticus Keller into a movie star. Phew. Quite challenging to translatea book to the screen. Especially your books that arean exceptional portrait of the complexities ofhuman relationships. To me, they're literature firstand detective literature second. Well, Raymond Chandlerhas always been a high bar. And yet Atticus isnothing like Marlowe. True. I dare say he reminds meof his creator. Oh. What do you think, Amy? Oh, uh, well I thinkfor someone who just met my fatheryou certainly know him. Oh. Uh, listen Dad, I have a lotof work I've gotta get done so I'm gonna- Uh-huh. - head on out, but is theresomething that you wanted to tell Celia about yourparticipation in the festival? I- I-I'm so looking forwardto it. Great. Yeah. - Yeah, ok. -Yeah. So out of the many, manycharacters in this book there's one characterthat touches them all. It's omnipresentbut never seen. Anybody wanna take a guessat who that is? Nobody? It's a bit of a trick question, but the answer is time. "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times." Now, when people read that, theyalways focus on best and worst and in actuality Dickenswanted us to focus on the repetition of timein that opening passage. A Tale of Two Citiesat its heart is really just about the passageand weight of time. And how the past is neverreally the past. Uh, okay, I hope to see youall at the Book Festival. Thank you, have a good day. Hey Dad, what's up? Honey, what do you think ofthat paisley shirt of mine? Uh... Yeah, talk to you later. Okay. I'm sorry, Dad, what dol think of what? Too flashy? What exactly are wetalking about? Well, there's a little gatheringof writers at the Garrison Eatery tonight. Yeah, I know that, because I invited you about three weeks ago and yousaid you weren't interested. Ah. Well, Celia thinks it'sa good idea for us to go. Oh. So you're going with Celia? So paisley? Or-Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, howabout that burgundy polo that you gave me for Christmas? Dad, I think- Or that simple blue button down, huh? I am overthinking it, right? Dad? Nah, nah. Just stick with the- with the classic greyzipper sweater. That's classic. Ok, great. Thanks, honey. Love you. See you there. Hello-Hello? Knock, knock. Mmm. Sorry, you're eating. Mmm, no, I'm just-I'm justchewing but now that's over. What's up? Forensics said that your lockwas picked with a pick gun, which means that this wasn'tyour burglar's first time at the rodeo so it's notlikely a student. So you're telling methat a professional thief broke in here to steal nothing? Yeah, I know. But hopefullyif they come back to get what theydidn't find... Boom. We're gonna catch 'em. Alright, I gotta go backto the station. Enjoy... what is that, a PP&J? No, it's a PP&B. Banana? Yeah. It's good. Yeah, alright. Oh, oh, oh, Travis. Could you just not mentionthis to my dad? What, that you like eating peanut butter and bananasandwiches? No, about the break in. He's just got a loton his plate. Is the festival stressinghim out? Well, that and the factthat his nemesis is coming. Alright, this I got time for. It's this writer, Rick Fitch. A long time ago Rick and my dadused to be really good friends and then my dad wrotehis first book. Right. Atticus Kellerlnvestigates- No. That is not his first novel. His first novelwas a thriller called "The Lady Lost in the Woods". And then Rick released his bookbefore my dad and guess what it was called. What? "The Woman in the Woods". I'm assuming that is nota coincidence. Mmm. It was my dad's storyjust re-written. My dad wanted to sue himbut my mom convinced him to pour all of that angerinto something new so he did and he wrote about a detectivewho had been wronged, who became a crusaderfor justice. This is the Atticus Kellerorigin story. Yes. Do we know who slipped Rickthe manuscript? His old publisher. Betsy Crane. Yeah, but she deniesthe whole thing. However, the good thing is, is my dad was only contracted to write five Atticus bookswith her so after that was over he leftBetsy Crane Publishing and end of story. However, the bad news isBetsy's also here. Alright, well I understandthen uh... my lips are sealed regardingthis break in. - Thank you.-Yeah. I know what you're up to. Guess where I am. Hey, pretty lady. Hey. Woo, you look good! Thank you. And thank you for workingyour magic with your father. Oh, well I think the wandbelongs to his new editor. Uh-huh. Yes. I mean, he seems... Like he's 16? I was gonna say happy. I know I should be happyfor him, right? It's an option to consider. I know. Amy. You look ravishing. Oh, thank you. Oh. Graham, don't you agree? Absolutely. - Hi. -Hi sweetie. I like the paisley. Yeah. Rick Fitch. Well, well, well. Here we are at long last, Graham. Celia Bunton. His editor. Rick Fitch. And this is Tabitha Feltonand Amy Winslow. My daughter. The History and English chairs who's departments aresponsoring this festival. Pleasure. So you're Amy. I'm Amy. You remind meof your mother. Um, thank you. Well, I just wanted to stop byand tell you how much I loved your new book, "Funeral Music". Thanks, but youdon't have to say that. No, no, no. It's the truth. It must have been catharticto write that one after Julia's passing. I wanted to offer my condolencesto both of you. I- I should have sent a card orsomething when I heard but... We appreciate that, Rick. Uh-huh. Yeah. Julia was an extraordinarywoman. We always agreed on that. Well, at any rate, nice to meet you, and uh, best of luckwith the festival, Graham. Not that you'll need it. You too, Rick. You ok? Yeah. Yeah. Seems to wanna bury the hatchetand I'm good with that. - Yeah.-Yeah. Well, cheers. Yeah, cheers. To a marvellous day. No. This is crazy. I just drove here a couplehours ago. Well, you probably just ranover a nail. We'll call Triple Ain the morning? I'll take you home and Celia, I can take you home, too. Oh, my car's just arrived. No worries. Get home safe, you two. Bye. - Good night.-You too. What? You know what. She's a charming lady. Mmmhmm. Where's your car? Right here. Let's go. Graham Winslow! Uh, hi, hi. Do uh, do I know you? Hannah Steinhousen. President of the Graham WinslowSociety of Frankfurt. I can't believe I'mtouching the hand thattyped "Amber Moon". So uh, there's actually a GrahamWinslow Society in Frankfurt? Oh, of course there is. Graham, I could not helpbut notice you're having some problems with your car. I have mine right here. I'm happy to drive you. Oh, well I'm sure thatmy daughter- Absolutely. Yes. Oh, Professor Amy Winslow. Of course. A pleasure. Hannah Steinhousen. Hello. If it's trouble for you to driveyour father I am happy to accommodate. I have my car right here. That won't be necessary. I've got him taken care of. But thank you. Have a good night. Nice to meet you, Hannah. So much more than just niceto meet you, Graham. Ok. Gute nacht. Thank you, honey. Wow. Whew. You don't think that she uh... What? Did something to your carso she could drive you home? I'd bet money on it. Deja vu. Are you kidding me? Phil Jenk. He really must wannasee me. Graham. Phil. Amy gave me your card, I wasplanning on contacting you, But it's been a little busy. That's why I figured I'd make iteasier and come to you. Ten o'clock at night. What's going on, Phil? We have to talk. Hey, buddy. Hey, Graham. Thanks for coming. Yeah, of course. Travis, Phil Jenk. Reno PD. Reno, Nevada. Do you happen to knowBilly Tremont? He was on the job with mein Chicago before he movedto your fair city. Don't think I do. Well, he's one of the good guys. Why don't you tell me what youwere telling Amy and Graham? Alright, a few days ago thisthing arrived in my office. It's a festival passand this thing here. "You're a gambler. Smart money says Atticus dies." It's a line from my dad's book. Yeah, "One Armed Banditos". I just finished reading it. It's a good book. Did you run forensics on it? No prints, no DNA. Postmarked from Los Angeles. Why didn't you call usat Garrison PD? You read "One Armed Banditos". You tell me. Right. That's right. Atticus is in cahootswith a cop, turns out that he's dirty. Yeah. But they said I could trust you. So someone that sent you thisdid so because you had historywith my dad. Is there anyone elsethat you have history with at the festival? Uh, Rick Fitch, yeah. Amy told me aboutthe two of you. Yeah, we saw him atthe reception tonight. I'd say we've moved on. What's your history with Rick? Same as with Graham. He used me as a resourceon a book. What book? He hasn't finished writing ityet, he said. Definitely hasn't paid me. Yeah? How much didhe stiff you for? You questioning me here, now, Detective? I'm the one thatbrought you this. Hey, Phil, I'm justdoing my job. Same as yours. He owes me ten grand, ok? That's a lot of money. I will take care of this. Look after that stuff. It's in good hands. Thanks, Phil. No problem. And listen... We should meet upafter your festival thing. I got a book for us to writetogether. Yeah, sure. I'd love to. Great. Ok. Ok. So? Thoughts? Well, my thought is this: Have you received anythreatening correspondence? No. Alright. Well, maybeit's a prank, maybe not. Either way I'm gonna havean officer with you at all yourfestival events. Great. You're the best, Travis. You alright? Not exactly. You know that I'm on it, yeah? Yeah, I know. I know you are. Two nights in a row you'regetting calls from me. Amy, you call mewhenever you want. I mean, you know, whether-whether there's a break in or there's a threatto your dad- Mmmhmm. Yeah. Something criminal, I mean. I understand. I got you. I'm sorry, I just... I'm feeling a little... - Yeah.-Yeah. Uh, so I'm gonna see you atmy dad's book signing tomorrow? You will, absolutely. I'll be there. Ok. Good. Alright Amy. Hey, Travis. There's a guy sitting in his carover there just kinda watching us. Hey! Sir, can I help you? He's dead. Have you ever had any contactwith Arnold Van Vleet from Fresno, California, before? Nah, I haven't, no. How did he...? Oh, gunshot. Medical examiner said sometimebetween 8:00 and 9:00 tonight. Dad and I wereat Garrison Eatery but Phil Jenk mighthave been here. I mean, he was here waiting onus when we got back around... - 10:00. -10:00. Yeah. I will be talking to Phil. We better start canvassingthe neighbours. Right. Thank you. Ok, sweetheart. You drive safe, ok? Alright, Dad. Love you. Me too. I'll get it processed, guys. Thanks for the hard work. Hey. Oh. - What's up?-Hey. Any word on Arnold Van Vleet? No. None of your dad's neighboursknow who he is and he doesn't havean arrest record. I got a detective down in Fresnodoing a door-knock for next of kin. Ok, well, I've been doinginternet searches and all I can tell you is thatwhoever he was he did not use social media. Like none. You're worried about this. The guy got shot in frontof my dad's house. And then there's thatthreatening package. By the way, have you spokento Jenk? No. You know what? I left messageson his cell phone, I called his hotel. Do you remember my friend, Billy Tremont, from Reno? The one who Jenk saidhe didn't know? Yeah. Billy knows him. Get this. Jenk is on leave whilehe's being investigated by internal affairsfor wiretapping hissuperior's phones and using that for blackmail. Are you serious? Absolutely. Phil Jenk is an unreliablenarrator. Of what? Oh, um, it's a-it's a writing term. It just means that whoever'stelling the story isn't being honest. Probably the best example ofthat would be Agatha Christie's "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd" in which the narratoris the killer. Spoiler alert. Sorry. All I meant was that what youfound out calls into question Phil's entire story. Exactly. What if he sent that packageto himself to get in good with my dad to pitch that bookidea he's been hustling? Huh. Maybe we go to the festival, try to look for him sincehe's not calling you back. Yeah. Alright. I'll just get youone of these lanyards. Lanyard. There you go. Thanks. Wow, Amy, you dida wonderful job. Yeah, it's a good turnout. I don't see Jenk, though. Amy! Travis! Hey! What're you guys doing? Book signing. Your dad. You know he'll sign your booksat any time, right? You don't have to standin line. Sure, but this is so muchmore thrilling. Hey, Amy. Do you see that woman? She's got your dadon her shirt. Oh yeah. She's the one that triedto drive him home from Garrison Eatery last night. That's a little scary. Yeah. Do you guys want to join usin line? Uh, no, we're lookingfor a cop. Not this one. Or that cop. No. You guys are safe. Enjoy the line. Have fun. You're losingyour place. Oh, my gosh. The line just got longer. Oh! What? That's Rick Fitch. Right there. The guy that stolemy dad's book? Yeah, yeah. "The Woman in the Woods". Yeah. Doesn't look like anybody's tooexcited about the new printing. Amy! Hello. Hey, Rick. Come on closer. I don't bite. You don't bite. Rick Fitch. Travis Burke. Excuse me. I uh, I never sleep wellin hotel beds. I don't either. I'll give you a little tip. Take a nice, long, warm bathright before you go to sleep. - Really?-Mmmhmm. That works? Every time. Huh. Oh, so this is your new book, huh? Yes, indeed. You know what? I would like to buy one. Amy? What're you doing? Uh, just buying a book. Nonsense. Your money'sno good here. That's on the house. Here's your iced tea, Rick. Amy, a word? Oh, ok. Nice to meet you. I tried to speakwith your father but he was otherwise engaged. Would you be so kind as toinvite him out to my motorhome? Your motorhome? Oh yes, I drove up. And I'm parked at this idyllicspot at the end of Route 301. Oh. Mmmhmm. Ok. Is Rick gonna be there? Oh, no. He despises nature. If it were up to him he'd neverleave his apartment. But please, come for a visit. And uh, bring your boyfriend. Oh. Oh, no, no, no. This is not my- I'm not-I'm not a boyfriend. He's just my colleague. It's a work thing. Yeah. Well, whoever you are, you're welcome. And please give thatto your dad. Ok. Ok, don't worry about that. Come on, Amy. We shouldkeep looking. There he is. Mmmhmm. Our unreliable narrator. Doesn't look like his audienceis being too receptive. No. Hey. Detective Jenk. You having fun? Sure. I saw the uniform you postedover on Graham's booth. Good move. Thanks, thanks. Hey, I wanted to ask you, about what time did you show up at Graham'slast night? Just before 10:00. Yeah. And where were youfrom 8:00 to 9:00? Why? Answer the question. At the hotel. Eating room service, whichwasn't delivered until 8:20. Which I know because I was not happyit took 45 minutes. You can call the hoteland confirm that. Or maybe you can clue a fellowcop in on why you're asking. Arnold Van Vleet. Is that supposed to meansomething to me? I guess not. Hey, good luck sellingyour book. Thanks. See ya, Jenk. You believe him? Well, I'll be confirming withthe hotel about room service but did he look like he knewVan Vleet to you? Honestly, no. Ah, perfect timing. Hey Dad, Celia. There you are. Celia, this is our good friendDetective Travis Burke, who's responsible forour friend with the badge. Celia Bunton. Pleasure, Celia. So, how'd it go? He was brilliant. Per usual. Hey Dad, you getthat tire fixed? Turned out it was slashed. Hold on a second. Slashed with a knife? I knew it. It was your German stalker. Ok, Graham, listen. If anything like this happensin the future you have to let me knowabout it. Of course. But she was fine today. Yeah, because Officer Hightowerwas standing right behind you. Oh, Dad. Betsy Crane wanted meto give you this. "My motorhome, end of 301. "It's the right thing." Is she kidding? A conversation with this womanis gonna end up with one of us killingthe other. And I've made plans to takeCelia up to Hawk's Peak to see the view. Hawk's Peak? He says it's gorgeous. Yeah. Listen, why don't uh, why don'twe go to the hotel and have tapas tonight? How's 8:00? Sure. Great. We gotta get out of herebefore the sun sets. - Bye.-Bye. So what is the dealwith Hawk's Peak? It's just where he usedto take my mom. And you know, here's the thing. It's-I don't want himto be alone and- and she's lovely, you know? She's beautiful and smartand she's British for crying out loud. I don't know, it's just... You miss your mom. You are a very good detective. I know. Hey, you wanna go look atsome more books? Yeah. How did I end up buyingmore books than you? Well, apparently I'm a goodinfluence on you. No! You will do no such thing! You can't tell me what to do! That's Betsy Crane. Hear me on this! If you do I will end you! Is that a threat? Oh, it is a warning. Hey, Amy, will youhold these? Yeah, sure. I can do whatever I want. Excuse me, is there-is therea problem here? Ah, the not boyfriend. Yeah. Detective Travis Burke. No problem, Detective. I'm simply exercising my freedomof speech. Tah-tah. She is a piece of work. Yeah, I know. They both are. My dad was right to steerclear of them. Yeah. I'm gonna head back and do alittle follow up on Van Vleet. Um, will I see you tonight? Yeah, you will. That's interesting. Oh, hey, there she is. Hey. Hey sweetie. Hey. Travis is just catching us upon that poor guy that was killed on my block. Just telling your dad and Celiathat Arnold Van Vleet apparently was married and therewere frequent domestic bouts between him and his wife. He was abusive? No, other way around. But he never pressed charges. Really? Oh, my goodness! What? There's a story on Book Blogon how Rick Fitch plagiarized "Woman in the Woods" from Graham. Let me see that. Yeah, it says that Betsy Craneleaked the manuscript to Rick. Why are they rehashing thisthing after all these years? Well, Book Blog's coveringthe festival, I suppose some intrepidyoung journalist is trying to get clicks. I want my money! - I don't owe you anything?-Where is my money? Excuse me. I don't care about any of that! And I don't care who signedthe cheque! Hey, hey, hey, hey. What's the trouble, Jenk? No trouble, Burke. As long as these two pay mewhat they owe me. Unfortunately you haven't readyour contract. Contracts are binding. Contracts matter. And in this casel'm holding the cards. Alright! Hey Jenk! You go upstairs and you cool off or we are going to continuethis conversation down at the station. I'm going, I'm going. Alright, everybody. Show is over. Are you guys doing alright? Oh, I'm enjoying this. - I'm fine, Detective.-Alright. Oh, Graham. Forgive all of this. Finally, a face to face. Betsy. I was hoping we couldcatch up. What do we haveto catch up about? You coming back to Betsy CranePublishing. Why would I ever do that? Oh, I can think of at leastfive reasons. Truthfully, I'm quite happy with my current publishersand editor. Where's Celia? Uh, she was just here. Celia? Huh, strange. I'll call her. Boy, Jenk is out of control. Yeah. ...Please leave a message. No answer. Maybe she went to her room. I'll have the front deskcall her. Ok, I'll tell Travis. Ok. Can you- I read all about thison the internet! Alright, calm down. Please calm down. I published Graham. I'm the only reason you evenknow who he is. You are a traitor, Betsy Crane. You should end up just likeJill Killian in Graham's novel "The Scarlet Dress"! Hey! Hey, enough! You need to walk away now. And may I suggest, Miss Crane, that you head backto your motorhome? That's exactly where I planon going. Whew. People really care about books. Yeah, yeah. Want to head back in, find your dad. Well, Celia's gone missing. Dad's in a tizzy tryingto find her, so. Some people don't react wellto angry people in the bar. I understand why. Jenk is scary. Betsy is no picnic either. Right? And then there's Hannah. Where did everybody go? I don't know. Where are they? You wanna ask our friend? Yeah. Hello. Hi. Did a man come here askingfor a woman named Celia Bunton? Yes. I called her roombut she didn't answer. Did he go up there? No, a guest approached him. Ugh. Was it a German woman? No, a man. One of our guests, Mr. Fitch. Oh. Uh, would you happen to knowwhere they went? They went out the front door. Great, thank you so much. Thank you. Where is he? I don't get it. Where did he go? I don't know. Maybe they're offmending fences. Ugh. Well, I'm just gonnagive him a call. Hey, it's Graham. Please leave a message. Voice mail. Hey Dad, um, so I guess youjust took off with Rick Fitch? Which is great. Uh, if you could just give mea call that'd be great. Thanks. I don't know. This is not the way I thoughtthis night would end. No. No, this night took a turn. It did. Yeah. Um, well, uh, I guess we shouldprobably just get some sleep. Yeah, that's a good thought. I'm just parked- I'm gonna walk youto your car. Oh, you don't haveto do that. Well, you know what, Amy? I'm already doing it. Yes, you are. Look at this. - We're here.-We're here. Ok. Uh, well, good night. Ok. Good night. Sleep tight. Dad? Hey, hey, honey. Hey, uh, hey. What happened to you last night? I was calling, left messages, you didn't get any of those- I am so sorry, Rick and I wentlooking for Celia and we ended up walking hereand talking and then I- it just... it wore me out. Ok, alright. Well, so you're talkingto Rick? That's... Yeah. Good. Yeah, ok. - Yeah?-Yeah. Oh, I'll get it. Hey. Hi, Amy. Can I come inside? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Hey, buddy. What's wrong? Betsy Cranehas been murdered. Murdered? What? Murdered? Are you-are you sure? It was murder. What happened? I'll share the details with youat the appropriate time. Travis. Graham, will you join medown at the station? Answer a few questions? Yeah, sure. Let meget changed. Wait, wait. Hold on, Dad. Why can't you just ask himthe questions here? You're familiar withhow I do my job. I'm familiar with how youtreat your suspects. No, honey, honey, Travisis just asking for my help. Give me a second. Thanks, Graham. Yeah. What, you're just gonna haulmy dad downtown and just- Hey, I'm not hauling anybody. Well I hope you're gonna talkto Phil Jenk. I am. I'm talking to Rick Fitchand Hannah Steinhousen and anybody who knows or hadany dealings with Betsy Crane. That's standard protocol. Yeah. Yeah, I understand. Uh, listen. I gotta run an errandso would you tell my dad that I'll pick him upat the station later? Yeah. Amy. - Hey.-Hey. Travis told me about Betsy. What happened? A couple who lives up onthe ridge heard an explosion, called it in around 1:00in the morning but by the time the firedepartment got here the motorhome was pastthe point of saving. Betsy was inside? But the ME says thatshe was killed first. Blunt force trauma. And then they set it on fire. Kerosene. Ok, thanks. Hey. Hey. Hi. Where's my dad? Uh, listen. Your dad gave us permissionto search his place. Ok. Amy. We're arresting Graham. What?! For arson and suspicionof murder. Are you kidding me? On what grounds? The evidence. What evidence? The evidence we foundin the trunk of his car. Amy, my officers found a nearlyempty can of kerosene. It's the same kind of kerosenethat was used to torch Betsy's motorhome. So my dad boughtsome kerosene. It's- We also found a paperweightwith blood on it. Now, we're gonna match some DNAthat we pulled from a hair brush from Betsy's rental car, but it doesn't look good. Hold on. I mean, my dad, he never lockshis car in the driveway at night, you know? I mean, someone could haveplanted that there. He's being set up. Amy. Come on, do you actuallybelieve that my dad is a killer? Listen, what I- Dad! Wait! Dad! It's okay, honey. Dad! I'm calling your lawyer. Just relax. Hold this right here, sir. Look at the lens. Hey, kiddo. Hey. Hey, you. - Hey.-Hey. No touching, please. - She's my... Sorry. It looks like I'm gonna get somegood material out of this, huh? Dad, this isn't funny. It's ok, honey. I know. Uh, so I spoke to your lawyer and he's sending a top criminalattorney from Seattle. Her name is Gia Palladino. Now listen to me. I do not want you talking toTravis or anybody else in here until she's with you. Ok? Understood. Thank you. I'm gonna get you out of here. Let the lawyer do that. Dad, I am- Amy, somebody killedBetsy Crane. I don't want you goingafter that person. I- You listen to me. You promise meyou understand me. I promise. I'll talk to you later. Ok. My dad's new criminal attorney, Gia Palladino, is heading in from Seattle. I don't want you talking to himwithout her. Understood. I can't believe you did this. Amy, I'm a cop. Rule of law matters. I have to follow the evidence. Yeah, well while you're doingthat I'm gonna go find out who's setting up my dad. Of course you are. And you're notgonna tell me to stop. You wouldn't listen if I did. He's your dad. Hear me on this. I do not believe that Graham isthe killer and my hope is thatone of us will prove that. And one of us will. Bud, hey. Meet me in my classroom. My dad's been arrested. Hey. I was at Holly's whenyou called. Amy. Thank you guys for coming. Yeah. I brought coffee. I brought the boardso we could start doing that whole yarnand suspect thing. Thank you. So here's the thing. My dad doesn't really wantme pursuing this, you know? And he has good reason. I mean, someonemurdered Betsy Crane. I mean, this is serious. So while I really appreciateyou guys, I just want you to know that- Hey. Amy, we're here for you. Totally. Yeah. Thank you. Ok, let's get started. Ok, here we go. Phil Jenk. He's a corrupt cop, he's prone to violence. He's probably gonna losehis job soon and Betsy owes him $10,000. He did it. But there's also Rick Fitch. He used to be reallygood friends with my dad backin the day, way before I was bornuntil he plagiarized one of my dad's stories andused it for his first novel. That's a bad guy right there. Then we have super stalker fan, Hannah Steinhousen. Now, I am almost positivethat she knifed my dad's tire, which means she's not abovebreaking the law. Wait, maybe it was her. One scenario is that Phil Jenkwanted to continue his conversation withBetsy Crane in private and then things go south. And then he kills her. But I did overhear Hannahthreatening Betsy for betraying my dad, and she even told her thatshe wanted her to end up like one of the murder victimsin his books. Ouch. Well, then Hannah did it. Yeah, but I don't understand whyshe would wanna frame my dad. It doesn't make sense. Good point. Yeah, but we can't forgetthe corrupt cop who's had dealingswith my dad. I mean, if anybody knows how toframe someone it's gonna be him. Especially somebody he knows. Exactly. But then there's Rick Fitch. Now, Rick came here to burythe hatchet with my dad but that could all just bea ruse to cover up the fact that he's actually jealousof all of his success. That's a good angle. I don't know much aboutthe relationship between Rick and Betsy, however I did overhear an argument they were having. What'd they say? Betsy said that she wouldend him if he did something. Did what? I don't know, I didn't hearthat part. Maybe he ended her first andthen he pinned it on your dad. I'm really liking Rick for this. But there's one more. Celia Bunton. My dad's new editor. Why would she kill Betsy? And then frame your dad? I don't-I don't know, I'm just saying that it- she's a possibility. Amy, maybe you have Celiaon the board because you don't like thatyour dad has a crush on her. I'm not gonna put someoneup here on the board and say they're apossible murderer just because I'm, you know- Hello? Oh, Amy. Celia. Is your father alright? He's- Uh... why do you ask? I went by Graham's house and there were severalofficers there. Yeah, you kinda disappearedon us last night. Oh. I'm sorry. The scene was a tad upsetting. A couple people getin an argument and you have to run off? No, I recognized the man. Phil Jenk? Well, I knew himas Petey Jenkowski. This was years ago, I was a junior editor and he was with the NewYork Police Department. Came to me with a book proposal based on his timein the vice squad. Sounded good but in realityit was dull and monotonous and I told him so. He didn't like that. And he came after mein my offices. Luckily security was there andl had had a restraining order placed against him. Then I heard that he transferredout of New York. It was years ago but itall came flooding back. I am so sorry. Thank you. Anyway, your father. Betsy Crane's been murderedand they've arrested my dad. What? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Arrested on what grounds? Evidence. The murder weapon and keroseneused to light her motorhome on fire were foundin the trunk of his car. No. No, this is madness. We know. We know, which is whywe've been... Ah, Bud... You know, we just... uh, Celia, we just... had to considerall the possibilities. There's a lot-a lotof people up here. Of course. But I think we should callTravis and let him know about your history with Jenk. Yeah. What should Holly and I do? Well, I'd love to knowsome more about Hannah. If you guys could maybe call the Graham WinslowSociety in Frankfurt? They might know something. Yeah, sure. Ok. In the meantime I will tryto contact Rick Fitch. Palmer Inn. Hi, I'm trying to reach aguest of yours, Rick Fitch? One moment. They're asking. So have you ever hadany dealings with this guy, Rick Fitch? Well, I met him at the eventthe other night but other than that, no. Huh. What about Betsy? You know her? No. I'm sorry, he's not picking up. Would you like to leavea message? Yeah. Will you have him call AmyWinslow at 564-555-2710? Of course. Ok, thank you. Yeah, so I guess I'm justgonna have to keep calling. Phil! Tell Bud to call Travis! Wait a minute. Sorry, I didn't bring my pass. Sorry. Are you ok? Phil, stop! Ok? It's over, Phil. There's no way out. The police are on their way. I know what you didto your bosses in Reno, I know what you tried to doto Celia Bunton in New York. What did you do to Betsy Crane? I didn't kill her! Then why are you running? I'm not supposed to comewithin 500 yards of that woman. I'm in enough trouble as it is. I don't need to be the guyyou pin Crane's murder on to save your old man. Phil, did you send thatinvite to yourself so you could come hereto get to Betsy? Look, I'm broke. I'm probably gonna getcanned soon. Ask yourself this. Why would I kill the womanwho owes me $10,000? Huh? I don't know. Well, the violation ofhis restraining order gives me cause to hold himand then I'm gonna build a case with the judge to searchhis hotel room. Good. You alright? Yes. And grateful to Amy. To you. Oh. Excuse me. She was hoping to be ableto see my dad. Yeah, that's fine. Listen, uh... are you- Yeah, fine. Forgive me, I have a work firel need to put out. I must dash. I'll be in touch. Ok. - Ok.-Bye. - Ok.-Ok. Hey, are you ok? Yeah. Travis is holding Jenk andhe's going to search his hotel, so it's good news. Great. We have news, too. Ok. The Frankfurt Graham WinslowSociety, it does exist and it's run byHannah Steinhousen. Ok, how is that good news? Because I searched every page onthe site and way at the bottom of the blog I found some photosof the charter members. Ok. Check out Hannah Steinhousen. Huh. Let's find out who our imposteris, shall we? Can you ring your guest, Hannah Steinhousenand tell her that Amy Winslow is downstairswith the complete works of Graham Winslow allautographed for her? Sure. Thank you. Ok. I've got it pulled up. Alright, let me see. Hello! You... where are the... The books? Yeah, I lied about the books. Just like you lied aboutwho you are. I... that's... I know that's not you. Now, I could call the policeand have you charged with identity theft or you couldjust tell me the truth. I just wanted to get closeto Graham. We have a bond. I know it. I just thought it would bebetter if I came from an exotic place far away. Where do you come from? Fresno. What's your name? Joyce. Joyce what? Van Vleet. You're Arnold Van Vleet's wife. The one that attacked him, aren't you? Yeah. Bud, call Travis. What am I saying? You're gonna tell him that Joycehere shot and killed her husband in front of my dad's house. Didn't you, Joyce? Arnold hated the bond I hadwith Graham. He followed me here. To Graham's house. And I told him... I warned him not to try and tearme and Graham apart. I was just trying to scare him. I didn't mean to kill him. Hey, we just foundthe murder weapon in the glove compartment box so we'll be looking extra hardat her for Betsy's murder. Now that we know she's capableof homicide and considering her obsessionwith your dad. Yeah, good. And Phil Jenk and Rick Fitch, which-sorry. The Palmer, front desk. Hi, this is Amy Winslow. I left a message earlierfor Rick Fitch. Yes, that message is still here, but he hasn't returned. Ok, alright. Thank you. Well, he obviously doesn'twanna talk to me. Yeah? Well he has no choiceabout talking to me. I'll stay on him. Ok. Yeah. I guess, we'll call it a night, huh? As Poirot would say, we mustrestore the little grey cells. Hey Travis, I just want reallyto say thank you. I'm just doing my job, Amy. Thank you. I mean, you helped close the case on Hannah Van Vleetso thank you. Well... Now, why don't you go restoreyour little cells or whatever. Good night. Hey, Amy, how does he knowthey're grey. Hey, Travis. Hey, Amy. Meet me at your office. I know who broke into it. - Yeah, ok.-Bye-bye. Amy! Hey! When were you gonna tell me? Your father's been arrested? You know, I'm so sorry, I know his event is today- Amy, I don't careabout the event. I care about Graham, and you. What's going on? Well, he's innocent andl'm trying to prove that. That's what I hoped you'd say. Go get him. And don't think another thoughtabout this festival. Thank you. Of course. Go. - Hey.-Hey. So who broke in? Alright, so when we searchedyour dad's house yesterday, among other things, we found that his househad been bugged. Bugged? - Yeah. -As in- Listening devices, yeah. So then when Jenk came in we got the warrant to searchhis hotel room. We found listening equipmentand recordings from two places. Your dad's house... And here. Bingo. Oh, wow. You know, when I met Jenk here he thought this was stillmy dad's office. Yeah, that makes sense. Alright. Hey, you've been busy. Yeah. So Jenk wasn't tryingto take something, he was actually tryingto leave something. Found it? Bingo. I still don't understand, though. Why is he trying to listen inon my dad? I don't know. I mean-ok, so you rememberhe was trying to blackmail his superiors in Renoby recording them? Yeah. And remember how he wanted todo a book deal with your dad? Yeah. What if he was trying to getdirt on your dad to force him into a book deal? Dirt? On my dad? He doesn't know Grahamvery well, does he? No. Oh, have you been ableto tie Jenk or Joyce to Betsy's motorhome? Not yet. I need to talk to my dad. Dad, I'm trying to figure outwho killed Betsy. Amy. Honey, you promised methat you wouldn't, and you wouldn't- No, I-well, I mean technicallyl promised you that I understood thatyou didn't want me to. No, no! This is-this is nota word game. I know what this is! Amy, look. I don't want you- No, no! You listen to me! Mom was taken awayfrom us way too soon. I'm not about to havethat happen to you. Alright? I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do, Dad. So you can either geton board or not but I'm gonna do it anyway. Ok. I need you to look at somethingfor me please. Can you tell me aboutsome of these pictures? Um... Hemingwayand Fitzgerald. Those were mom's nicknamesfor me and Rick. Yeah. You guys were best friends, right? Yeah. Competitors? But apparently in morethan just writing. Take a look at that picture. I mean, Dad, the syntaxis pretty clear. "Rick and me with G". Did Rick date mombefore you got married to her? Mmmhmm. And um... uh, he was pushing to marryand uh, mom didn't want to. She broke it off. A few months laterl asked her out. I want to make something clear, honey. I had nothing to dowith breaking them up. But I bet Rick didn't see itthat way, right? No. Then he stole my book. Did Rick ever marry? - No.-No. You know, it's- it's you and mom have thisgreat marriage, you know? You become a bestselling author. Those were all thingsthat Rick wanted. Hey, Travis? I think we need to talkto Rick Fitch. So Rick shows up in Garrison, pretends to bury the hatchetwith my dad, but maybe that was justso he could get close to him to frame him. Ok, right. That makes sense. But then why kill Betsy Crane? Celia, would it be possible forBetsy to have advanced payments to Rick for a book thathe never finished? I'd say so. Of course. There's your motive. So what happens now? Well, Travis is bringing in Rickfor further questioning, so we just- There he is right now. Hey, that didn't take long. Did you talk to Rick? Hey. No. That's not gonna be possible. Rick Fitch is dead. Dead! Yeah. What?! Hey. My phone call was notan invitation for you to join me downat the crime scene. Well, I know, but I justhad to see this for myself. Thank you. I don't understand. This doesn't make any sense. Why not? Because Betsy told usthat Rick hated nature so why is he rock climbing? Well, either Betsy was wrong or Rick thought when in Romedo what the Romans do. Travis, we got something. Hang on. Show me! Did you guys find somethingon Rick's phone? This isn't Rick's phone. It's Betsy Crane's. What? Wait a minute, so if Rick hadBetsy's phone- It means he took itafter he killed her. So then my dad- I need another warrant, yeah. Close down the crime scene. Will do. Detective Burke. Uh, I have anothersearch warrant, this time it is to searchRick Fitch's room. Can you let me in? Of course. Thanks. I'm gonna need youto wait down here. Oh, come on, Travis. I- Hey, Amy, look. We gotta do thisby the book. Kerosene? Hey. Hey. So I didn't find his cell phone, but I called forensics because I definitely smelledkerosene in Rick's closet and I found whatlooks like blood. That's it. He framed my dad. But here's what confuses me. Why would he storethose things here? You know? Why wouldn't he take it straightfrom Betsy's motorhome to your dad's car? Who knows? But this has to be enoughto release my father, right? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey kiddo! Oh, Dad! I'm ok. I'm ok. Graham, I- No, no, no, no, no. You had a job to do and youkept doing it and here we are. Thank you. Graham. Oh, hey! Hi, hi! Oh, jeez. Take it easy. Forgive me. I'm just so relieved. It's ok, me too. Me too. Hey, you three, I thinkthat we should get back to the tapas meal that wasinterrupted, what do you think? That sounds lovely. Eight this evening? Uh, yeah. That works for me. Amy? Yeah, yeah. Of course. Terrific. Graham, I hate to diveright back into business but we've had some seriousinterest on the movie rights that we dare not push awaythis time. Could we chat? If you think it's a good idea, I'm all ears. Bye, Dad. You ok? Yeah. Yeah, I'm ok. He likes her. And to be honest with you, so do I. Hey, let's grab some coffee. My office. Here you go. Oh, thanks. Hey, is this- That's the murder weapon, yeah. I've seen this before. You have? Yes, I have. Thank you. Bingo. Right there. Hey, can I help you? Hi. Where did you get that owl? Oh, those are made exclusivelyfor the hotel. "Those" as in plural? Yes, they're in all our rooms. We need to look atRick's room again. Thank you. Well, he didn't use his owlto kill Betsy. I don't know. I mean, unlesshe had it replaced. Yeah, maybe. Front desk. Hi. This is Detective Travis Burke. Hey, in the last couple of daysdid Rick Fitch ask for his paperweightto be replaced? Not Mr. Fitch, no. What's that supposed to mean? Did someone else ask? Yes. Who? And those are the room locationsof everyone you asked about. Alright. Thank you, Sharon. Ok. Alright. Thank you. What did the publishingcompany say? Well, they confirmed thecontracts and the rights and they're gonna email youthe paperwork. Alright, take a look at this. These rooms? They're right nextto each other. Huh. Take a look at this. Did you check to seeif this gear was bought at Garrison SportsDepot? Hey, we've been a little busy. Oh. How about we do it now? Ok. Thank you. You better be here to tell mel'm about to walk. I'm afraid not, Phil. You see, I know what's reallygoing on. Remember what we're after. Yeah. Oh, Detective. Hi, Celia. I thought we said 8:00. Can I come in for a second? Of course. Thanks. Of course. Come on in. Thanks. Oh, Amy. So are we doing um, room service, then? We need to talk to you, Celia. What about? You know what is funnyabout hotel rooms? It's all the little thingsthat just kinda disappear into the background. Like a paperweight, for example. I mean, how many people wouldeven notice a paperweight? And then how many peoplewould actually call down to the front desk and askfor another paperweight to be brought to their room? Sorry, I'm not following- But you did, yesterday. How would you even know thata paperweight was missing unless you were the onewho brought it out of the room and used it to commita murder? Amy, it sounds likeyou've been reading too many of yourfather's books. Oh, you know it's funnyyou should say that 'cause that's what this isreally all about, right? My father's books. Especially the first fivepublished by Betsy Crane. I called her companyearlier today. They sent over a contractthat gives the exclusive rights to produce Atticus Kelleras a movie franchise to- I'll just make it easy for you, it's right there. Betsy Crane. And she conveyed that in theselittle cryptic coded messages to you twice rightin front of us. The first time wasin a note to my dad, which she knewyou would see. Give this to your dad. "It's the right thing." The second time wasat the bar that night. Contracts are binding. Contracts matter. And in this casel'm holding the cards. You just disappeared. You said that... The scene wasa tad upsetting. But you weren'tupset about Jenk. No, you were upset aboutthe millions that you'd planned on making from the movie. That it now had just beensnatched up by Betsy Crane. So then you leaked that storyto the Book Blog in order to put pressure on herbut it didn't work. She made it very clear to youthat she held the cards. And it made you angry. So you went to her motorhomeand you brought one of those. Detective, this is fictionand not even the crime genre. It's more like fantasy. But I talked to Phil Jenk. I know what's really going on. We have Celia Bunton. Confess or get chargedas an accessory to murder. I bluffed Jenk and he folded. I never thought I'd hearfrom her again after New York. She said she forgave mefor what happened. She paid me 10 grand up front, another $10,000 whenthe festival ends, plus she said I'd get aconsulting role on the movies. She sent you the invitationwith the message? Yeah. Real dramatic. I thought it was overkill but... you bought it. For a minute. But she had you bug Graham'shouse and Amy's office. She wanted to knowwhat Graham was thinking. And going after Betsy? That was never part ofCelia's deal. Betsy provoked me into that. Well, I'm surprised you wouldcredit the word of a disgraced policeman. Well that and the wordof Rena Corey. And who might that be? Oh, she runs GarrisonSports Depot. We sell that gear, yeah. Sold some a couple days ago. To this man? I don't remember him. I do remember a niceEnglish lady. I still don't understand what some mountaineeringgear has got- Oh, stop! Just stop, Celia. You murdered two peopleand Travis has more evidence than you can talkyour way out of. I didn't go to the motorhomeintending to do harm. Quite the opposite. I heard that Betsy hadhad a... an aggressive streak sol grabbed whatever I could to take with mefor self-defence. Tempers rose and we fought. It was me. I lost control. This thing happened. I found the keroseneat the motorhome, and I've edited enoughcrime fiction to know that a victim requiresa culprit. Lucky for you there was oneright next door. One that had a volatilerelationship with Betsy. And Miss Celia Bunton is here, and Mr. Rick Fitch. I noticed that the balconies, they're adjacent. It's easy to getfrom one to the next. It's easy to hide incriminatingevidence in Rick's room. And you, you probably thoughtthat Rick's room was empty. But it wasn't empty. Forgive me. I never sleep wellin hotel beds. You know, I'll giveyou a little tip. Take a nice, long, warm bathright before you go to sleep. Rick could have went to Travis, and I'm sure he probablythought about that. But then he also thoughtabout all of my dad's success because that's what he wantedfor his own life. And then there's alsomy mother which, by the way, you couldn'thave known about. Rick dated my mombefore my dad. And I'm pretty sure that he wasstill in love with her. When he found out that shehad passed he probably felt... he probably felt many things. So he came here to burythe hatchet with my dad which he did. And you just gave him a chanceto dig it right back up again. Once you found out thatmy father had been arrested you knew what Rick had doneand then he came after you. He called. Forgive me, I have a work firel need to put out. I must dash. He demanded I publish his bookor else he'd expose me. But what he didn't know is that you held onto Betsy's cell phone. You invited him to the ravine. Rick? Celia. Look, why don't you comeand join me and we'll talk about your deal. You set up the climbing gearand then you did to Rick what you had doneto Betsy Crane. Except this timeyou did it with a rock. Made it look like he fell. Ironic, isn't it? I'm the one who's fallen. Celia Bunton, you're under arrest. You have the rightto remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against youin a court of law. You have the rightto an attorney. If you can't afford one, one will be appointed to you by the State of Washington. Dad. Hey, cutie. I tried calling ya. Where you been? What's going on? Celia... I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. Hey, Dad, do you wanna maybetake a seat for a minute? Oh, brunch is served, buffet style! Ooh, all you can eat! Bud knows the drill, huh! Look at that! Ok, uh, before we dig inand sit down, um, Amy wanted me to makethis really big speech. Stop it. No, no, ok, ok, ok, ok. Um, let me just please say thatl am beyond grateful for all your support. Travis, thank you for followingthe evidence all the way through. And to my daughter, Amy, who... Hey, to Amy and Travis. To Amy and Travis. Cheers. To Graham. Cheers, Dad. Well, he seems to bemoving on well. Yeah. Yeah, he is. He's writing a new book. Atticus falls in lovewith a killer. Woah. Yeah. Mark Twain said it best. Write what you know. I like that. Hey, listen, I just um... I want to say thank you. For what? Well, because you didn'tgive up on him. Nah, Amy, nah. It's more like you're the onewho didn't give up on him. Well, thanks for not giving upon me then. You give me no choice. What've we got? First you need a plate. You need a plate, a plate...
