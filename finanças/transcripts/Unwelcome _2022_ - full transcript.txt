Okay. Okay. Anything? Give us a chance, babe. Are you telling me all that incredible sex was for nothing? Have you put the rice on? - Yes, chef. - Yeah, not too much. Oh, fuck! Hmm. Well, we know it's not your eggs. It's my boys. They just... need a bit of get-up-and-go. We can try the frozen peas on my bollocks again. The most humiliating night of my life. I remember that. Was that even a thing? God knows. Anyway, who needs kids? Can't go to the pub, can't go on holiday. You can't get stoned. And our sex life will be me wanking six nights a week. Twice on Sundays. Hey, little baby, don't you cry Mamma's gonna buy you a... House in a gentrified part of London It's all right to be a little bit wobbly, babe. - Hmm? - I'm not wobbly. - Yeah, you are. - No, I'm not. I know you, you are. It's always been you and me versus the rest of the world. And soon it might be you... and me... and it versus the rest of the world. Oh, God, they don't stand a chance. No, they don't. The moment of truth. Okay. No? Yeah. No. Holy shit! Yes! Careful, careful, careful! I'm pregnant! - Oh, my God. Call your mum. - I said it out loud. - I'm... I'm pregnant. - We need to get champagne. I know, I... I can't drink any more. Well, alcohol-free fizzy, then. Oh, my God, you are fucking amazing! Mwah! - You're amazing! - Oh, my God, okay. Um... Either way, this means one of my boys got through. I am a man! Okay, I need to go and do it again. I need to go and call my mum. I'm gonna go and do it again. - We're having a baby. - I'm pregnant. - I love you. - I love you. Oh, my God. Oh, fuck. Excuse me. Mate. Yeah, you. Sorry for calling you a wanker yesterday. - That's all right... - Got any blow? Uh, no. No, I don't... Mate, what's wrong? I can't ask a question? Fucking anti-social, man. Am I right? Excuse me, mate. What's that, champagne? What, you rich, mate? Excuse me! Mate! Yo! What, are you the Secret Millionaire? You gonna answer me or what, wanker? It's not champagne, it's fucking prosecco. Okay? Non-alcoholic. My girlfriend's pregnant, so go fuck yourself. Okay? Honey, I'm home! Got the bubbly-wubbly. Good, babe. Because I'm definitely, definitely pregnant. Have you called your mum? She's gonna go mental. Oh, shit. Yeah, no, I need to call her now. Go fuck myself? - No, no, no, no! - Babe? Oh, my God. No, please. Please, stop! Hi, uh, is that the police? Uh, yeah, I need someone to come, um, right now, please. Um, there's... There's a break-in. Yeah, it's, um, 115 Duncombe Road... Help! Help! Help! No, please, she's pregnant! Whoo! Get away! Get away from me! Whoo! Is that right? You up the spout? Well, go on, then. Do it! Let's find out if you're really nice... or nasty. That's it, girl. Shit, feds! Fam, come on! Come on! Nice girl, then. Shame, that. Jamie... My God. It's so green. Slight change from the estate. Yeah. Just a bit. Look, I don't want to be the fun police, but you have to stop smiling all the time. I can't help it. It's just... gorgeous. Your Aunt Maeve has just died, remember? I... I know. I know. But she's left us a house with a huge garden. Yeah, I get it, babe, but have a little dignity in your grief. Ah. Just happy. And... and sad. There's milk in the fridge, and I made sure you had a full canister of gas. God forbid you should start your new life in a house where you can't boil a kettle for a cup of tea. We have an actual septic tank. We are proper country bumpkins. He's so easily pleased. Um, what about the roof? Oh, no. I can sort that. You can't change a light bulb without getting vertigo, babe. We'll get a professional. - I'll email you some names. - Great, thank you. Thanks, Niamh, you've been amazing. - Oh, no bother, sure. - Seriously. Maeve wanted to keep the place in your family, Jamie. And she'd have loved you, Maya. Did you know her well? As well as anyone could, which is to say... not very. She was a funny one, Maeve. There is one more thing I need to show you, and it's a little bit... little bit peculiar. Yeah, I came on holiday here loads as a kid. It was good times. I remember you. All freckles and elbows, running round like a cat with its tail on fire, chasing bees and butterflies. Aunt Maeve was always giving me sweets. Club chocolate bars. Do you remember them? I think she used to spoil me because she never had kids. Oh, yeah. I remember this. Aunt Maeve would never let me go in there. Can we go through there? Do we... do we own the wood as well? Maeve believed in the old ways. Every evening, before sunset, she'd leave a blood offering here. Sorry, did you say blood? Well, not like the Aztec fellas ripping their hearts out of their chests. No, no. She'd leave a little slice of liver or some such. For who? - The Little People. - Leprechauns? Brilliant. Oh, I love it. It's so Irish. Not leprechauns, exactly. Some call them the Far Darrig, or the Redcaps. So she thought that these leprechauns, um... sorry, Little People, lived in that wood? Maeve's was a life of sorrow. She did have a child, but one she... Oh, no, please, tell us. Her husband, a young man, funny fella, like yourself, Jamie... he passed first. Pneumonia. Then the child. - Maeve blamed herself. - Why? Maeve told me it was punishment for turning her back on the old ways. Well, she fell in love, had a family... and she forgot to respect the Little People. Poor woman, losing her baby like that. Seriously, I had no idea. Mum... Mum never said a thing. Maeve truly believed that what she was doing was important. And if it's all right with you, I'd like to continue the tradition. An offering. Every day. You mean you would be coming into our garden every day? I'm not sure we're... No, um, I can do it. Every day? We've been gifted this beautiful house, and if doing this is the only price we have to pay, then we're very, very happy to do it. - It's no problem. No. - I promise. Bless you both. Come to Fennessy's tonight. - First drink is on the house. - Thanks, Niamh. - We will. Thank you. - We will. It's very sweet. Bye-bye. Did you pack any raw liver? You know, that's the one thing I forgot to pack. Damn it. Shit. Shit! I had a list and everything. - It was, uh, milk, tea bags... - Blood. Bloody raw liver for the... what is it, Redcap-offering-ritual thing? What was I thinking? This is our house. We live here. Can you believe it? Hmm? I never thought that we'd get out. Hey, hey, hey, hey... That's in the past. All right? I am never going to let that happen to you again. We're safe here. I promise. Okay? Just you, me and the little one. - Mm. - Mm-hmm. Echoes of the pain That you have hung upon the staves -Let it flow -Let it flow -Let it flow -Let it flow I hear the wind Rattling my window pane -Let it blow -Let it blow -Let it blow -Let it blow Parallel lines Running through time Parallel lines They will never entwine Birds gunshot scatter from your eyes... Hey! Hey, shoo! Shoo! Go on. Shoo! Look what I found. Oh, yeah. This used to be on the mantelpiece. Yeah, Maeve would cross herself every time she looked at it. Do you think that's her child? Oh, yeah. That. Yeah, I'll fix it tomorrow, babe. Going. Yeah. I need an Irish SIM. Hi. My husband emailed you about getting some work done. Ah, okay. It could have gone into your junk mail maybe. Niamh recommended you. Does that help? Yeah, it's our roof. Yeah. Um... I mean, as soon as possible, really. Yeah. Since when did you eat Marmite? Cravings, babe. Cravings. I mean... could they start this week? She's actually laughing. Your Aunt Maeve was some character, I can tell you. Healing hands, she had. Oh, she helped me with a touch of the gout back in the day, and for that, well, Jesus... No, no, put that away. Put that away. - Really? - No, it's on the house. - It's my treat. - Oh... Mm. Mm... Oh, man, this is so good. - Everyone is so nice here. - Yeah, they are. Hey, whoa! Check it out. Look. General builders. Brilliant. This wasn't on Niamh's list, though, babe. Darling, this is Ireland. It rains 365 days of the year every year, not just leap years. The weather hasn't been that bad, has it? Not yet. It's sunny now, but trust me. Roofing and kitchens. Result! - Hello? - Babe, we should at least... Fuck me! Jesus Christ! Thanks for that! - It's all right. It's okay. - Fuck! Shh, shh. Hi. - Sláinte! - Sláinte! Oh! Ah. - There you are, son. - Oh! You'll taste the difference straight away. It's not like that muck they give you over in London. - Good luck to you both now. - Thank you. Baby clothes. Like this. A whole sack. I won't take no for an answer. That's actually... Thank you! - They're so nice. Thank you. - Great! They're lovely. Aw! - Hi. - Oh, bejaysus. Cheers. Sláinte. - I'm Seamus. - Nice to meet you, Seamus. Maeve's house must be a right auld shambles. She never had much time for your modern innovations. Jaysus, she didn't even get the electricity till after the millennium. Yeah, it's a fixer-upper. Yeah, mate. Big feckin' hole in the roof. Oh, we've noticed. That's our priority. But trying to find a builder round here... that isn't booked up is impossible. Ah. They're all busy lads, huh? No. Actually, we've been lucky. We managed to find someone to start straight away. What's his name, um...? - Col...? - Colm Whelan. The Whelans! That shower of cowboys. Is there a problem? Ah, don't take any notice of them. The Whelans are fine. They might get a little raucous at the weekends, but they'll do a good job. Daddy Whelan keeps them under control, sure enough. You'll be grand. Just don't leave your missus alone with the lads. They'll be playing on her baps like kids on a bouncy castle. Wow! Rory, would you ever shut your hole? - It's... it's not cool, man. - Wow. No. I don't mean nothing by it. I do think you're beautiful... Now, that's it now. Home. Go home and sober up, you old fool. You're an old witch. Away and wash the back of your bollocks! Go home and you can apologize when you're sober! Ah! Me bollocks! And take your dog with you! Fuck you! Come on! Ah! Ah! Go on! Youse can take your... So... what did you leave out tonight? - Sorry? - For the Redcaps? - Oh, shit. I'm so sorry. - Did we do it? I completely forgot. Maya, you promised. You said... I know. I'll do it as soon as I get home. Cross my heart, pinkie promise. Uh, what was it? It was raw liver and... Was that it? - Yeah. - Right. Can I have a... a word? - Fucking hell. - You're in trouble. - Really? This is really fun. - Go on. Go and get told off. What'll you have, Father? Guinness, please, a half. - Let me do this. - Do what now? You won't even know I'm there. First thing in the morning... So you want to wander in and out of our garden, willy-nilly? It's our house, it's our garden. No. I made a promise to Maeve. And I get that, but I can't... - What harm will I do? - No, Niamh! Look, back in... back in London... we had three guys break into our flat and try to kill us. What? I'm so sorry. I... I had no idea. That... that must have been awful. Yeah, it was. And I can't be scared in my own house. Not any more. Not again. And not with this child. When you said you'd forgotten... I broke a promise, and I know that. It's important, Maya. You have to do this. God, you really do believe, don't you? I saw one once. In the wood at the bottom of your garden, sure as I'm standing here. Plain as day. But what happened to not perpetuating stereotypes of leprechauns and all that? The Far Darrig... are not jolly little elves, Maya. They'll be hungry. And they'll need feeding, every day. Okay. Okay. Every day. Promise. Thank you. Molly! Molly, come back here now! You silly dog, ya! Ahh! 'Twas a box of the finest old oak, sir 'Twas a foot long and four inches wide Says I to myself, "Fuck the fairies," ha! And I took a quick look inside Now I opened the lid of this box, sir And I swear that my story is true 'Twas an ancient old Irish French letter A relic of Brian Boru... Come on! Come on, Molly! Go on up the yard now. 'Twas an ancient old Irish French letter 'Twas a foot long and made of elk hide Molly! Molly! Come back here now! Who's there? Away home now. Stop wasting my time. You feckin' Jackeens! I'll kick your arse for youse! It's past your bedtime, little one. What are you now? Boo! Wake up! Babe, wake up! Shh, quiet. You'll wake them up. Oh, for fuck's sake! Move your arses. I want this kitchen done before I die of old age. Yeah, well, if he's not movin' them, what am I supposed to do? Careful, you big gobshite! Hello? Oh. Jamie, Maya. Lovely to see you again. Mr Whelan, we weren't expecting you. Daddy Whelan. Everyone calls me Daddy. Hmm? Job fell through, so we, uh, thought no time like the present, huh? Look, you don't mind us at all. You just carry on with your day as if we weren't here. Okay, um, it's just we would have preferred if you'd called ahead because you all scared the shit out of us. No, you, maybe. I mean, I was fine. Actually... actually, I wasn't. I was terrified. Would you like a cup of tea, Mr Whelan? Daddy. Call me Daddy. - Three sugars, plenty of milk. - Sorry. So, you're gonna be starting on the kitchen first, not the roof? I mean, we would actually rather the roof was done... Well, the scaffold won't be here till tomorrow, so, uh... we thought why not make the use of our time and start on your kitchen? Eoin, help your sister with that, will you, before she drops it. I'll dock it from both your wages. You brothers and sisters, are you? Eoin's our brother from another mother. She was a big auld fuckin' lump, too. Killian! So, you're starting a family business yourself, huh? - Yes. - When is it due? Thanks, darling. Um, any day now. - Really soon. - Boy or a girl? Oh, well, we want it to be a surprise. Killian. Use the cutters, for Jaysus's sake, not your teeth. Um, is it three sugars, Mr. Whelan? Yes, please, darlin'. Call me Daddy! Killian, get back to work. Did you see how the one with the dodgy haircut was staring at you? Well, I saw the sister giving you a little smile. And the dad, making you call him "Daddy". If he does that again, I'm gonna... Then you're gonna what? - Are you gonna start a fight? - No. - But I can finish one. - Ooh. With your big Irish cricket bat. Just... Just don't call him "Daddy", okay? It's weird. All right. We're not in Camden any more, Toto. If we piss him off, we've still got a hole in the roof, remember? There's been a place of worship here since the time of the Druids. Even Cromwell and his men couldn't extinguish our faith. Is this your first child? Sort of. Sort of? When I was very young, before I met Jamie... I was with a guy, I got pregnant, but he wasn't father material. I see. It was a difficult decision, but I don't regret it. Our lives would have been bad. Really, really bad. And... I want this so much. It's a fighter. Maya, I can't approve of your actions, but... I sincerely hope that you find peace here. Thank you. Well, Jamie, here we are. Here's your Auntie Maeve. Next to your uncle and the little one, of course. Well, uh, I got you some flowers... to say thank you. We really appreciate you leaving us the house. More than you know. So are they just stacked up like Lego under there or... - Jamie. - I'm just curious. No, they're side by side. Of course, the child is just a stone. - She was cremated? - No. The body was never found. Uh, didn't she die of pneumonia? Seriously, I have never drunk so much tea in my entire life. I've got so much caffeine in my system, I'm gonna be pissing pure Barry's for days. I am. That's Niamh. Pull over. Pull over, babe. Oh, yeah. If you see anything, stop, raise your hand and call out and one of the supervisors will come to you. Hey, Niamh. Hi. Rory didn't go home last night. No one's seen him since he left the pub. Oh. He was pretty drunk, wasn't he? You don't think he's... Oh, no. It's... it's Molly I'm worried about. - His dog. - Can we help? No, the lads have it covered. You go on and have a cup of tea. Oh, tea, yay. Can't wait. I'll see you in a second. Um, we went to go and see Maeve's grave today. Father Brendan told me something interesting. The baby didn't die of pneumonia, did she, Niamh? She made a bargain with the Redcaps... to save her dying husband. But Maeve paid a terrible price. What price? She said the Redcaps took her baby. I mean... could it have been... a post-natal depression thing? Because... some women do hurt their children... Maeve loved that child more than life itself! She wouldn't harm a hair on her head! No! No. After the baby disappeared, she devoted her life to leaving those offerings. Keeping the monsters on the other side of the wall. So you're telling me that my lovely Great Aunt Maeve, who used to give me chocolate bars, was a baby killer? - Great. - No, we can't judge. - People do crazy things. - Yeah. Crazy. I was nearly abducted when I was a little toddler outside my nursery, and then my mum... Your mum punched the guy unconscious. Yes, I know, because she tells me that every time I fucking see her. All I'm saying is that women, mothers, - are capable of crazy shit. - Yeah. - Ow! - Don't fuck with Mumma Bear. Yeah. Shit. - Aw. Did I hurt you? - Fucking guns, you have. - No. Doesn't hurt. - Did I hurt Pappa Bear? Doesn't hurt. Pappa Bear is fine. - Oh, is Pappa Bear bruised? - Pappa Bear's fine. Oh, for fuck's sake. Take a breath, babe. I'm really not in the mood for a fight. Is that fucking weed? Having a break? - Yeah. - Yeah. You know, I would prefer it if you didn't actually smoke your doobies on my doorstep. - I need a bath. - Okay. - Where's your dad? - He's seeing a customer. Can I get in my own house, please? - Your house? - Yeah. You own it, do you? All the way to the core of the Earth? Well, the freehold, yeah. Ash, how many times have the English come to this country and told us what's ours is now theirs? Too many, Killy. Thing is, though, don't we always take it back? Always. Henry VIII, the Desmond Rebellions, the Nine Years' War. You heard of them? Oliver Cromwell. Ah, fuck it, yeah. How could I forget that arsehole? - Yeah. - The famine. - Nah, two famines. - Two fuckin' famines, yeah. Seems to me that when the English like the look of something, they either buy it cheap, or send an army in to steal it. Would you like some ketchup with that massive chip on your shoulder? I like your place, boss man. It's nice. Maybe I should steal it. No court in the land would convict you, brother. Yes, yes, they would. And don't give me this "Irish Rover" crap. I'm not Oliver Cromwell. I'm actually Irish. You? Irish? - Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah, on his ma's side. Da told me. His Auntie Maeve used to own this place. Ah, yeah, yeah. That mad auld bitch that killed her kid, is it? That's her. So that makes you what, ugh... quarter Irish? Quarter Irish? Jaysus, it's like being in the presence of Michael Collins himself. Oh, Jesus Christ! Please, she's pregnant! Jamie! Maya? - Maya! - Maya! Maya! - Maya! - Darling Maya. Ah, you know, Eoin's... simple. But he doesn't mean any harm. Yeah, I know. I was just very scared, that's all. And what about the other two? They seem to be... I'll have a word with them tonight. But, you know, their mother passed away not so long ago. - Oh, blimey, that's awful. - Really sorry to hear that. She could keep them on the straight and narrow. She just had to say a word. Me? Well, I prefer the more direct approach. Yeah, all right, okay. I don't want you hitting your kids and... Ah. Well, they need to know their place. We all need to know our place. This is gonna sound a little petty, but they actually ate all my chocolate Hobnobs. I don't mind... I don't mind if they ask, but... Well, far be it from me to get between a man and his choccy biscuits. Oh, Jesus! Oh, well, like I said, I'll... I'll have a word. - Thank you. - Thank you. Well, see you bright and early. - See ya. - Thank you, Mr. Whelan. Daddy! Why the fuck does he keep on asking me to fucking call him "Daddy"? Just a fucking lunatic. No, it wasn't just the Hobnobs. They ate my fucking grapes, too. Yeah, and one of them left something in the loo. What? You are fucking kidding me! Fuck's sake! Hey... Why don't you go and take that out on the punch bag, babe? They're fucking useless. Useless bunch of... Fucking hell. - Eoin! - Eoin! Eoin! - Eoin, you're bleedin' thick. - What the fuck? Somebody could have been killed! What are...? No, wait, wait. What the fuck are you laughing at? Stop fucking laughing! - Fuckin' chill out, man. - No, no. This... This is your problem. You don't take anything fucking seriously! Hey, hey. Calm down, calm down. Shh. Calm down. It was a fuckin' mistake, man. It was just an accident, right? No, no, no... No, babe, they have to go. You have to go right now! No, I can't fucking take this any more! Calm down, please. Listen, it was an accident, wasn't it? That's what I've been saying. But he keeps getting angry. Are you frustrated, Jamie? Do you know what? You are unprofessional. You are lazy. And... and you are thieves! Baby, please. - Thieves, is it? - Hey, hey, hey, hey! - Stop it! Stop it! - You come into my house. You break my things, you take my stuff, you... Stop! - Back off. - Fuckin' big man! Whoa-ho! Fuckin' David Beckham. Please stop. Will you just shut the fuck up right now, please? Oh, darling, it's all right. It's okay. I'm all right. You're all right. We're all okay. Aren't we, yeah? We're gonna fix it. It was just an accident, okay? It was just an... Hey, stop! What the fuck are you doing? Hey, hey! Stop it! Stop fucking... Stop it! Daddy! Daddy, not in my home. Your home. My child. And I'll punish him however I... Stop! Stop it! Daddy, stop. Step away. - Who's the daddy now? - I'm not talking to you. What did I do? Rory? Wow. Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Oh, God. Oh, hello. You're Rory's dog, Molly, aren't you? Where is he, then? Huh? Is he drunk in a ditch somewhere, the dirty bastard? All right. You want me to follow you? I'm coming. Ah, you fuckin' eejit! Ey? Do you think I was done with ya? You fuckin' halfwit! Now get out of me sight! And if you're not back here before we're done, you can fucking walk home! Molly, come on. Oh, shit. Molly, come on, let's go home now. Molly, I can't whistle and I'm carrying an eight-pound baby. Molly? Molly, there you are, you silly mutt. Molly, what have you found? Huh? Rory? Rory, are you there? Molly? Hello. Oh, has something died in here? What the fuck is this place? Molly. Molly, come on. Oh, you want me to come down there with you? No fucking way. Molly, come on. Come on. Fine. You can stay here, but I'm not coming down there. I'm going. I'm going. Yeah. Good idea. Wait for me. Molly? Oh! Oh, God, it's you. Have you seen a dog? It's Rory's dog. It's the guy that's gone missing. I don't know if you know... Hey, are you all right, Eoin? My da hates me. Hey, listen, um... Hate's a strong word. I mean, you're his son and... Why would he do that? He says... He says when I was born, I killed my mammy, and... it... it should've been me and not her. Jesus Christ. Sorry. They all hate me. I'm not like them. I'm not clever or funny or cool. I... I'm just a big, useless fuckin' spud. Shh. Come on, don't cry. That's not true. What the fuck would you know? I actually do know, okay? This is what bullies do. Okay? They make you... They make you think that you're worthless, and... and they abuse you. I've not been abused. Come on, look at those bruises, Eoin. - You need to tell someone. - You can't tell anyone. - You have to tell someone. - No, you can't tell anyone. Okay, okay. I won't tell anyone. I'm gonna help you. But you've gotta be strong. - I am strong. - No, I mean... I mean, up here. My da says the English are all selfish, greedy cunts, but... you're sound. Oh, did he now? Thank you. No one's ever been this kind to me before. Okay. Well, you can let go of my hand now, okay? I really like you. You're starting to hurt me now. No, no... No, no, no, Eoin. Help! Eoin. Please... Please don't hurt me. Help me! Oliver Cromwell. Fucking Hobnobs! - Prick! - Jamie? Jamie? Daddy and the others, are they here? No, it's... it's just you and me. Why? Maya? Hey, what's up, baby? Is it our baby? I have something to show you. Okay. - Darling... - Shh, shh. Look... shall we go back to the house? Shh. - What are you doing? - Follow me. Maya, where are you...? It's here. It happened right here. Maya, Maya! Maya, come on. Eventually you're gonna have to tell me what's going on. Eoin tried to kill me. - He... he what? - Yeah. What... what did he do to you? Where is he? I'll fucking kill him! No, no, no, he's already dead. He's already dead. I, um, kneed him in the balls because he tried to attack me. And then... and then he held me down here. - What? - I couldn't breathe. I thought I was gonna die. I thought, "This is it." And then they came out of the woods. - They? Who is they? - There was a light. - Who came out of the woods? - And then I screamed for help - and they came. - Who... who came? The Far Darrig. The Little People. - The Little People? - Yeah, they had these knives and cloaks and, fuck me, when I say this out loud, I know... Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Just look at me. Look, is there any chance this is, you know, just... baby brain? I didn't fucking imagine this. - But this is... - No, no. He was dragged here. He was... he was dragged here and then... Ha! There! There! Look at this! Explain that! Explain it. Wait... what am I looking at here? It's... it's blood, isn't it? Maybe your brain blocked what really happened. Oh, fuck's sake, Jamie. Fuck's sake. Look, all I'm saying is that maybe he's done a runner, okay? He attacked you, you kicked him in the balls, or you... you cut him, and... and he's done a runner. No, that's... that's not what happened. Maya. Maya. Try and see this from my point of view, okay? Look, what is more likely? What is more likely? There's a hut. Okay, there's a hut. Deeper into the woods, and it was this way. And it's, um, made out of stone. - It looks like a beehive. - All right. And I think there were fucking human bones in there. - But Molly showed me. - Who is Molly? You know, Rory's dog, Molly. All right, no, come on. Let's... let's go back to the house. You're clearly under a lot of stress. - No, this isn't stress. - Then what is it? What is it? You shout more. - What? - You know, since that night, you shout more. And you're punching things. That's not the Jamie I know. I married a nice guy. And look where that got me! Yeah. And I was beaten, too, but you don't see me... And I had to watch... I had to watch! As they threatened you and my baby and I couldn't do a thing! Do you know what that's like? Do you know what that's like for a man? Of course you fucking don't. And it is my solemn promise that I will never, ever allow that to happen to you again. Where are you going? We're going home. And then I'm going to the pub. I'm gonna try one more time. He better fuckin' answer! Eoin, you big fat dope. Where are you? Da's going mental. Answer your phone! Eoin, we're renting your room out, yeah? So just fuck off and die. Don't bother comin'... Seriously, look, Da says all is forgiven, yeah? Just call us back. - Prick. - No sign of your brother, huh? Are you listening in on my call? - Nosy bitch. - First Rory, now Eoin. Call the guards, Aisling. Time to get them involved. With all due respect, Father, shut the fuck up. There's our man. Come on. We've been looking for you, handsome. - Oh, you have? - Mm-hm. Where's Eoin? I... I don't know. What... what are you doing? You got something in your teeth? Oh, Ash knows how to spot a liar. I'm... I'm not lying. Well, she's never wrong, though, so... if you've anything to hide, she'll find it. No, no, seriously, I'm not lying. I haven't seen Eoin since... this morning. You're such an uptight, frustrated little man, Jamie, aren't ya? I mean, look at you. You're like a can of Coke. You're all shook up but there's no one to crack the ring-pull. So does he know where Eoin is or what? He knows something. Just tell us, Jamie. Just release all that tension. Leave the lad alone. Will you mind your own business, you tramp? This is our business. He lives in our village. - For, like, five minutes. - You're barred. I think you should leave now. Yeah, not till we take care of this, all right? Oh, we all know how you Whelans take care of things. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well, if you know anything, or you hear anything, you come to us. To us. And not your wives or your husbands, and not to Niamh or the local fuckin' gossip, all right? And don't go to the fuckin' guards! - You come to us. All right? - Yeah. That's it now. Come on. Out! Bye, Jamie. The Guinness is shite in here, anyway. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. I'm fine. - I am so sorry. - No, don't worry. Thank you for sticking up for me, though. - Will you have another pint? - Love one. - Good man. - Thank you. Fuck. Help me! Help! Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Amumma wikka babby. Amumma! Ah! Oh, come on! Fuck! Oh... Fuck! Okay, Okay... Fuck! Hi, darling. Do you know that Krav Maga...? - What are you...? - Shh, shh, shh. I was only gone for a couple... I have something to show you. You what? Jesus, this is the last time I go to the fucking pub. Ow, babe, ow! You're hurting me. - Look in the bag. - Why? What are you fucking on about? Do you believe me now? Oh, fuck me, that's a head! - That is a fucking head. - I know. I know. - What did you do? - What did I do? I... I didn't do anything. That... that wasn't me. Okay, I saw one. It came through the French windows and it casually just dropped it off like it was... a fucking pizza delivery boy. Ah, a-ha. I got photos. I took loads of... I took loads of photos. Took loads of photos. Um... Shit, they came out really weird. I think it's their idea of a gift. - Whose... whose idea? - The Little People. The Redcaps. The Far Darrig. They're real. Baby, they're real. And they killed Eoin. And we need to take it to the police. And tell them what? That he was decapitated by a bunch of fucking leprechauns? Oh, God. - Oh, fuck, oh, fuck... - Oh... Hide that, stay out of sight. I'm gonna get rid of them. Uh... Who is it? I want answers, Jamie! Look, sorry, it... it's really late. We're actually just going to bed. Where's my boy? Look, Daddy... Colm, I have... I have no idea what you're talking about. He never left this place! I think you know what happened! No, we had nothing to do with it. Nothing to do with what? Nothing, nothing. We had nothing to do with nothing. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, you do! You do! You do! You do! You do! You pricks know something! Now open this fucking door! Whoa! Leave now or I... I am calling the police! I... I'm dialing. All right, calm yourself. We're... we're going now. Come on, kids! Oh, fuck me. Maya, where's your phone? Jesus! Get out! Go away. You... you can't do this! Jamie, me boy, when it comes to my family, I do whatever I want. Jamie, listen. If it was an accident, I understand. Hm? Eoin's a clumsy fucker and I've been making excuses for him for long enough. If he touched your missus, he has form there too, and... and I'm sorry. But you have to let me know. Okay... And I'll be the one to punish him. Where is the good lady Mrs. Jamie, huh? She's uncharacteristically quiet. Aw. What have we got... You're not answering me, Jamie boy. What? What? You're probably thinking of some other way - to get help. - Shit! Let me reassure you, this is not my first rodeo. No, no, no... Fuck! Last chance, Jamie. What is it? They... - What? - They... What? Jesus! Oh, fuck! It's... - It's Eoin. - Eoin? Eoin! Eoin! Please, we need your help! I'll kill him! Oh, shit! Fuck! Fuck this place up. Killian! Where are you? Get the fuck down here! Fuck! Shit! Killy! Oh! Fuck me! Maya. Fuck! Come on, fucker. Try me! Go on. Go on. Get out! Get out! Fuck! Oh! You all right there, fella? Looks like you're getting ready to make breakfast, huh? Oh-ho-ho! Come on, then. You gonna do this? Come on. Come on. What are you waiting for? Oh, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I... I... I didn't mean to... Oh, God, no. Oh, God, no. Please, God, this isn't fair. No, no, this isn't fair. We... We just came here for some peace. We just wanted some peace for our baby. Are you... are you fucking crying? This isn't fair. Fair? Look at me, look at me! When you fight like a girl... No! Oh, please... you get fucked like a girl. No, no, no, no. No, no... How's that for fair? How's that for fair? Killian? Have you got him? Fuck! Hello, hello? Oh, fuck, fuck. Yes. Yes! Hello? Please, I need your help! Hello? Please! Is anyone there? I'll give you anything you want. Killian! I'm in here, Da! He's crying like a baby. Aren't ya? Like a little fuckin' baby, huh? Jesus! Look at the state of ya. I don't know what happened to Eoin. Oh, well... I've got his head. Hmm? - Now where's the rest of him? - Eoin's head? What? Shut up, Killian. I just want to bury me son, hmm? All of him. - Now, where is he? - I don't know. No? Ah, but your wife does, doesn't she? Huh? Oh! Oh, bejaysus, look at that. You stabbed him in the back, huh? You're a right fuckin' hero, aren't ya? Now, are you gonna tell me what I want to know? - Huh? Huh? - Oh, please. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. I'll tell you, but you're not going to like it. Try me. It was the Far Darrig. The Redcaps. You know, the Little People. They're real. Killian, stop it! Jesus Christ. You know, I came up here to kill you. But if you tell me where the person is that knows what happened to my son, maybe, maybe... I won't have to. So are you gonna tell me where I can find that English bitch whore you call a wife? No, no, no, not now. Da! Da, she's here! Da, that stuck-up bitch is here! Good. Good. You killed my brother. You bitch! I'm gonna rip your head off. I guess we don't need him any more, huh? - Look at me. - Shh. Kill that useless streak of piss, Killian. - Really? - No. It's time you became a man, son. No... No. - I'll make you proud, Da. - No. Please, please, please don't kill me. Please don't kill me. I'm begging you. I'm begging you, please. What... What if the police catch you? You'll regret this. You will. You will. Oh, no, this is it. This is it. Maya, I love you, I love you... What the fuck is that? Da, get it off me! - What is it? - A big fuckin' rat? It's wearing clothes. Or is it some sort of monkey? It's wearing clothes! Well, monkeys wear clothes in the circus. You should be in the fuckin' circus. You've the brains of a rocking horse, do you know that? - Killian. - Yeah? Go out to the van and get the gun. - What? - Go on! No. No! Daddy, no! Get it. Yes, get it. Fuck you! What the fuck? Fucking... Oh, for fuck... Not so smart now, are ya? Oh, yeah, look at your brains. You like that, do ya? Stopped it. Stopped it fidgeting. What are you gonna do, give me the bumps?

Not this time. - No, no, no, Jamie! No, no... - Hey. Hey. It's always been you and me versus the rest of the world. Let's settle this like men. No, no, no, no, no... Fuck! Maya! Redcaps? It hurts.
