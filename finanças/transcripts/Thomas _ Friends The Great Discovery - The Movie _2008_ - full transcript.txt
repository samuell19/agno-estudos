THE ISLAND ALSO HAS LOTS AND LOTS OF RAILWAY LINES. WHO'’S THAT PUFFING DOWN THE TRACK? [ Toot-Toot! ] IT'’S THOMAS! HELLO, THOMAS! [ Toot-Toot! ] "HELLO, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO THE ISLAND OF SODOR!" [ Toot-Toot! ] [ Bell Dings ] [ Brakes Wheesh! ] SODOR DAY WAS COMING TO THE ISLAND OF SODOR. [ Chug-Chug-Chug-Chug... ] THOMAS AND JAMES WERE VERY EXCITED. THERE WOULD BE PICNICS ALL OVER THE ISLAND. [ Children Laughing ] A MAGNIFICENT BRASS BAND. AND THE BIGGEST CARNIVAL SODOR HAD EVER SEEN! ALL THE ENGINES WERE BUSY. [ Chug-Chug-Chug-Chug... ] [ Toot-Toot-Toot! ] AND EVERYONE WAS EXCITED! SODOR DAY WAS THE ISLAND'’S GRANDEST CELEBRATION. THOMAS AND JAMES WERE RACING TO THE WHARF. WHOEVER ARRIVED FIRST WOULD BE GIVEN A "SPECIAL" SPECIAL! "I'’M GOING TO WIN!" TOOTED THOMAS. "NO, I WILL!" WHISTLED JAMES. AND ON THEY RACED. FASTER THAN THE WIND AND MORE DARING THAN DARTING ARROWS. [♪ "Racing to the Wharf" ♪] Children Singing: [ Whistles Tooting ] THOMAS AND JAMES STEAMED INTO THE WHARF. FIRST, JAMES IN FRONT, THEN THOMAS TOOK THE LEAD. THE WHARF WAS BUZZING! BARGES CHUGGED, CRANES SWUNG AND FREIGHT CARS RATTLED AND ROLLED. THOMAS AND JAMES RACED BY. THE LITTLE NARROW GAUGE ENGINES WHISTLED AND WHEESHED IN SURPRISE AT THE SPEED AND THE STEAM OF THE BIG ENGINES. THE NARROW GAUGE CONTROLLER WAS WAITING. THOMAS WHOOSHED AROUND THE CORNER, PUFFING AND HUFFING JUST IN FRONT OF JAMES! "I WON!" TOOTED THOMAS. "HOORAY! BAD LUCK, JAMES!" JAMES'’ CHEEKS WERE AS RED AS HIS PAINTWORK! "I'’LL WIN ON THE WAY BACK TO TIDMOUTH!" "WELL DONE, BOTH OF YOU," MR. PERCIVAL ANNOUNCED LOUDLY. "JAMES, YOU ARE TO UNLOAD BARGES HERE AT THE WHARF!" JAMES SMILED. HE LIKED THAT JOB. NOW, HE DIDN'’T MIND LOSING THE RACE! "AND THE "SPECIAL" SPECIAL GOES TO THE WINNER, THOMAS!" THOMAS WAS EXCITED. [ Toot-Toot-Toot! ] "YOU ARE TO WORK WITH DUNCAN. "YOU WILL BRING LUMBER FROM THE HILLS "DOWN TO THE WHARF. IT'’S A VERY IMPORTANT JOB." THOMAS WHEESHED A WHIFF OF STEAM. HE WAS DISAPPOINTED. HE WANTED TO WORK AT THE WHARF. AND DUNCAN WAS TRICKY. HE LIKED TO TEASE THE BIG ENGINES, ESPECIALLY THOMAS! "DUNCAN," ADDED MR. PERCIVAL, "PLEASE LOOK AFTER THOMAS!" "MR. PERCIVAL SAYS THAT BECAUSE YOU MAINLINE ENGINES DON'’T KNOW THE TRACKS IN THE HILLS!" DUNCAN TEASED. "YES, WE DO! "MR. PERCIVAL WANTS ME TO WORK WITH YOU BECAUSE YOU LITTLE ENGINES CAN ONLY CARRY SMALL LOADS!" TEASED THOMAS BACK. DUNCAN HUFFED CROSSLY AWAY. LATER, AT THE TRANSFER YARDS, THOMAS WAS WAITING FOR DUNCAN. DUNCAN PUFFED IN. "IS THAT ALL THE LUMBER YOU CAN PULL?" TEASED THOMAS. "JAMES IS WAITING FOR ME AT THE WHARF! I CAN'’T WAIT FOR YOU ALL DAY!" THAT MADE DUNCAN CROSS! THOMAS PUMPED HIS PISTONS. HIS TRUCKS WERE NOW PILED WITH LOGS AND HE WAS READY TO LEAVE. THEN, DUNCAN HAD A CHEEKY IDEA. "I CAN SHOW YOU A QUICK WAY BACK TO THE WHARF. "BUT YOU HAVE TO GO OVER ROLLING RIVER BRIDGE. IT'’S VERY HIGH." THOMAS WASN'’T SURE. "YOU BIG ENGINES AREN'’T SCARED OF HIGH BRIDGES, ARE YOU?" PUFFED DUNCAN. "NO, WE'’RE NOT!" HUFFED THOMAS CROSSLY. "I LIKE HIGH BRIDGES! "PLEASE, SHOW ME THE WAY TO ROLLING RIVER BRIDGE." SO, THE TWO ENGINES STEAMED OFF. [ Chug-Chug-Chug-Chug... ] THOMAS AND DUNCAN CHUFFED UP TO THE JUNCTION. "TAKE THIS OLD TRACK TO THE BRIDGE!" PUFFED DUNCAN. "IT'’S DOWNHILL FROM THE OTHER SIDE, STRAIGHT TO THE WHARF!" THOMAS'’ SIGNAL TURNED GREEN. "THANK YOU, DUNCAN," THOMAS TOOTED. AND HE PUFFED OFF. [ Chug-Chug-Chug-Chug... ] BUT DUNCAN DIDN'’T KNOW THE HIGH BRIDGE WASN'’T SAFE. IT HADN'’T BEEN USED FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THOMAS CHUFFED SLOWLY TOWARD THE BRIDGE. THE BRIDGE LOOKED VERY OLD. AND IT WAS VERY HIGH. AND THE RAVINE WAS VERY DEEP. THOMAS COULD HEAR ROCKS FALLING INTO THE RAVINE. HE FELT A LITTLE SCARED. "I LIKE HIGH BRIDGES, "BUT THIS ONE IS REALLY HIGH! "IF I CHUFF SLOWLY, I'’LL REACH THE OTHER SIDE BEFORE I KNOW IT!" HE PUFFED BRAVELY. WHEEL TURN BY WHEEL TURN THOMAS EDGED ONTO THE BRIDGE. "I AM BRAVE AND I AM STRONG, I'’LL GET TO THE WHARF, AND IT WON'’T TAKE LONG!" HE CHUFFED TO HIMSELF. THOMAS WAS NOW HALFWAY ACROSS THE BRIDGE. THE SOUND OF THE FALLING ROCKS WAS LOUDER AND LOUDER. THE BRIDGE HAD STARTED TO SHUDDER AND SHAKE! THOMAS DIDN'’T LIKE IT AT ALL! BUT HE WANTED TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE! THEN THOMAS HEARD A MIGHTY CRACK! [ Loud Crack! ] PART OF THE BRIDGE IN FRONT OF HIM CAME AWAY FROM THE ROCKS. [ Crash! ] "CINDERS AND ASHES!" CRIED THOMAS. "I MUST GET BACK TO SAFETY." HE WAS VERY SCARED. THEN, THOMAS STARTED TO REVERSE. HE PUFFED SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY. THEN, THERE WAS ANOTHER MIGHTY CRACK! [ Crack! Crash! ] A LARGE PIECE OF THE BROKEN BRIDGE FELL DOWN INTO THE RAVINE BELOW! [ Crash! ] WITH THE BIGGEST PUFF HE HAD EVER HUFFED, THOMAS PUSHED BACKWARDS ONTO THE HILLSIDE. "I'’M SAFE!" HE CRIED... JUST AS THE LAST PART OF THE BRIDGE GROANED AND SWUNG OVER THE DEEP RAVINE. [ Crashing! ] THOMAS PEERED DOWN TO THE BROKEN BRIDGE BELOW. "OH, FLATTEN MY FUNNEL!" HE GASPED. [♪ Music ♪] THOMAS PUFFED BACK TO THE JUNCTION. HE SAW THERE WAS ANOTHER TRACK. [ Wheesh! ] [Toot-Toot! ] "MAYBE THIS TRACK GOES TO THE WHARF, TOO!" WHISTLED THOMAS. AND HE RATTLED AWAY DOWN THE STEEP TRACK. THE TRACK WAS COVERED IN THICK BRAMBLES AND BUSHES. THEY SCRUNCHED AND SCRATCHED AS THOMAS CHUFFED THROUGH THEM. [♪ Music ♪] "WHOO! NO ONE HAS BEEN DOWN HERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME!" HE HUFFED. AND HE PUFFED ON. [♪ Music Continues ♪] THEN THOMAS GASPED! HE HAD ARRIVED AT A HIDDEN TOWN. IT WAS OVERGROWN, RUSTY AND VERY OLD. "BUBBLING BOILERS!" THOMAS CRIED. THERE WERE LOTS OF OLD BUILDINGS AND A STATION COVERED IN IVY. "WHAT A FUNNY PLACE TO HAVE A TOWN!" HE TOOTED. THOMAS WAS VERY EXCITED. "I WONDER WHAT ELSE I'’LL FIND!" HE WHEESHED. THOMAS CHUFFED TO A HALT. "FIZZLING FIREBOXES!" HE GASPED. THOMAS HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH AN AMAZING SIGHT! "THERE ARE SO MANY BUILDINGS. IT MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY LARGE TOWN!" HE CRIED. "THAT LOOKS LIKE PART OF A TOWER." THOMAS WAS VERY EXCITED INDEED. "I MUST TELL EVERYONE ABOUT THIS!" HE TOOTED LOUDLY. [♪ Music ♪] THOMAS BUMPED AND BASHED HIS WAY ALONG THE OLD TRACK. HE HAD TO SPREAD THE NEWS! HE WHISTLED AS HARD AS HE COULD! "SOMEONE MUST HEAR ME!" HE THOUGHT. SO, HE WHISTLED AGAIN! SUDDENLY, A HORN HOOTED. "THAT'’S MADGE!" THOMAS TOOTED. MADGE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THOMAS. "MADGE! I'’VE DISCOVERED AN OLD TOWN! IT'’S HIDDEN IN THE FOREST!" WHEESHED THOMAS, EXCITEDLY. "FENDERS AND FLATBEDS!" EXCLAIMED MADGE. "EVERYONE MUST KNOW ABOUT THIS!" [ Engine Revs ] MADGE FOUND MIGHTY MAC AT A CROSSING. "THOMAS HAS DISCOVERED A HIDDEN TOWN!" SHE HOOTED LOUDLY. "TELL EVERYONE!" MIGHTY MAC TOLD SIR HANDEL... WHO TOLD SKARLOEY... WHO TOLD RHENEAS... WHO TOLD THE NARROW GAUGE CONTROLLER... WHO TOLD HAROLD... WHO IMMEDIATELY FLEW OFF TO FIND SIR TOPHAM HATT. SIR TOPHAM HATT HAD BEEN HAVING TEA WHEN HAROLD ARRIVED. "THOMAS HAS DISCOVERED A HIDDEN TOWN!" SHOUTED HAROLD. SIR TOPHAM HATT WAS VERY EXCITED. "TAKE ME TO THOMAS AT ONCE!" HE BOOMED. SOON, THOMAS AND SIR TOPHAM HATT ARRIVED AT THE HIDDEN TOWN. "HERE IT IS, SIR!" THOMAS WHEESHED. SIR TOPHAM HATT BEAMED FROM EAR TO EAR. "THOMAS, YOU HAVE MADE A WONDERFUL DISCOVERY. THIS IS THE TOWN OF GREAT WATERTON!" THOMAS GASPED! HE AND THE OTHER ENGINES HAD HEARD STORIES ABOUT GREAT WATERTON. "WHEN STEAM ENGINES FIRST CAME TO SODOR," SIR TOPHAM HATT SAID, "THIS WAS THE MAIN TOWN. "IT WAS CALLED GREAT WATERTON. THE WATERWORKS HERE PROVIDED WATER FOR EVERYONE." "WHY DOES NO ONE LIVE HERE NOW?" PUFFED THOMAS. "ALL THE PEOPLE LEFT TO LIVE IN NEW TOWNS. "AND EVERYONE THOUGHT THE TOWN OF GREAT WATERTON WAS LOST FOREVER." "BUT NOW IT IS FOUND!" CHEERED THOMAS. "THANKS TO YOU, THOMAS," SMILED SIR TOPHAM HATT "I WILL TELEPHONE THE MAYOR STRAIGHT AWAY. I AM VERY PROUD OF YOU!" THOMAS FELT REALLY IMPORTANT. "THANK YOU, SIR," HE TOOTED. "HOORAY!" SIR TOPHAM HATT ARRIVED AT TIDMOUTH SHEDS. THE OTHER ENGINES WERE VERY PROUD OF THOMAS. "THE TOWN OF GREAT WATERTON IS TO BE RESTORED IN TIME FOR SODOR DAY!" HE BOOMED. "THE RESTORATION WILL BE A LOT OF WORK." PERCY WAS PUZZLED. "WHAT'’S RESTORATION?" HE WHEESHED QUIETLY. "RESTORATION," GROANED GORDON LOUDLY. "THAT IS WHEN YOU MAKE SOMETHING VERY OLD, LOOK NEW AGAIN." "THERE ARE MANY JOBS TO BE DONE," SIR TOPHAM HATT ADDED. ALL THE ENGINES WERE PLEASED. SIR TOPHAM HATT GAVE EACH OF THE ENGINES IMPORTANT JOBS. [ Engines Whistle & Toot ] THEY WHISTLED AND TOOTED IN EXCITEMENT! "NOW, I WILL TELEPHONE MISS JENNY.

SO, MISS JENNY WENT TO SEE JACK AND HIS TEAM. "WE WILL WORK HARDER THAN EVER!" HOOTED JACK EXCITEDLY. AT THE DEPOT, MR. PERCIVAL GATHERED HIS ENGINES. HE SPOKE LOUDLY. "YOU WILL ALL BE VERY BUSY!" THE ENGINES WHISTLED AND TOOTED HAPPILY. "I KNOW YOU WILL ALL DO YOUR VERY BEST!" MR. PERCIVAL CHEERED. [ Engines Whistle & Toot ] [♪ "Jobs A Plenty" ♪] Children Singing: Boy Singing: Girl Singing: Children Singing: Girl Singing: Boy Singing: Children Singing: BACK AT TIDMOUTH SHEDS, SIR TOPHAM HATT WAS TALKING TO THOMAS. "THOMAS, YOU ARE TO FIND ALL THE LOST AND HIDDEN TRACKS AROUND THE TOWN." THOMAS WAS PLEASED! "AND BECAUSE YOU DISCOVERED GREAT WATERTON," SIR TOPHAM HATT ADDED. "I AM ALSO GIVING YOU THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB OF ALL. "YOU ARE TO BE IN CHARGE OF ALL THE WORK." "FIZZLING FIREBOXES!" PUFFED THOMAS PROUDLY. "I AM BRINGING AN ENGINE "FROM THE MAINLAND TO DO YOUR USUAL JOBS," SIR TOPHAM HATT ADDED. THOMAS DIDN'’T TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THIS, HE WAS TOO BUSY THINKING ABOUT BEING IN CHARGE OF ALL THE WORK AT GREAT WATERTON. THE NEXT MORNING, SIR TOPHAM HATT ARRIVED AT BRENDHAM DOCKS TO MEET THE NEW ENGINE. EVEN CRANKY WAS EXCITED! SUDDENLY THERE WAS A LOUD SOUND OF PISTONS PUMPING. FROM BEHIND THE CLOUD OF STEAM, A NEW TANK ENGINE PUFFED SLOWLY OUT. HE WAS SHINIER AND BIGGER AND STRONGER THAN THOMAS. "THIS IS STANLEY," BOOMED SIR TOPHAM HATT, "WELCOME TO SODOR, STANLEY." "OH, MY, MY," GASPED HENRY. "WHATEVER WILL THOMAS SAY?" THOMAS DIDN'’T KNOW THAT STANLEY HAD ARRIVED. HE HAD BEEN BUSY. HE HAD ALREADY FOUND A LOT OF HIDDEN TRACKS. THOMAS PUFFED PROUDLY ALONG TO HIS NEW ENGINE SHED. JAMES HUFFED UP. "LOOK AT MY NEW SHED!" THOMAS TOOTED GRANDLY. "WHILE I'’M IN CHARGE, I WON'’T HAVE TIME TO PUFF BACK TO TIDMOUTH!" BUT JAMES WASN'’T INTERESTED IN THOMAS'’ SHED. "I'’VE JUST MET THE NEW ENGINE," SNORTED JAMES. "HE'’S CALLED STANLEY. "HE'’S VERY FRIENDLY. "EVERYONE LIKES HIM. HE'’S DOING YOUR JOBS VERY WELL." THOMAS WAS SURPRISED. SUDDENLY, HIS NEW SHED DIDN'’T SEEM SO IMPORTANT. THE NEXT DAY, THOMAS HAD TO PULL HEAVY FREIGHT CARS OF STONE TO THE DOCKS HE STOPPED AT THE WASH-DOWN. HE SAW A SHINY NEW TANK ENGINE. "THAT MUST BE STANLEY," HE PUFFED TO HIMSELF. STANLEY AND PERCY WERE PLAYING AND JOKING. BOTH ENGINES HAD TOLD THE WORKMEN TO POUR ON MORE BUBBLES. PERCY WAS GIGGLING AND STANLEY WAS LAUGHING EVEN LOUDER. THOMAS FELT LEFT OUT. [ Toot-Toot! ] HE TOOTED TO HIS FRIEND, BUT PERCY WAS TOO BUSY HAVING FUN. HE DIDN'’T NOTICE THOMAS. THOMAS PUFFED ON. HE WAS UPSET. [ Chug-Chug-Chug-Chug... ] LATER, THOMAS STOPPED AT A JUNCTION. GORDON WAS WAITING. [ Toot-Toot-Toot! ] SUDDENLY, WITH A WHOOSH AND A WHISTLE, STANLEY RACED ONTO THE MAIN LINE WITH ANNIE AND CLARABEL. THEY WERE HAVING A WONDERFUL TIME! THEY CLATTERED STRAIGHT PAST THOMAS. "STANLEY KNOWS HOW TO HAVE FUN," GORDON DECLARED. THOMAS WATCHED STANLEY DISAPPEAR. HE DIDN'’T THINK IT WAS FUN AT ALL. THAT NIGHT, THOMAS PUFFED INTO TIDMOUTH SHEDS. HE WAS VERY TIRED. TONIGHT, HE WANTED TO BE WITH HIS FRIENDS. [ Gasp! ] "CINDERS AND ASHES!" HE GASPED. STANLEY WAS IN HIS BERTH! STANLEY BLEW A HIGH SOUND FROM HIS WHISTLE. THEN GORDON BLEW A LOW SOUND. AND EMILY TREMBLED A SOUND NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD BEFORE! ALL THE ENGINES WHOOSHED AND WHEESHED WITH LAUGHTER. "HELLO! YOU MUST BE THOMAS!" WHISTLED STANLEY. "HELLO, THOMAS!" CHUCKLED THE OTHER ENGINES. BUT THOMAS WASN'’T CHUCKLING. HE DIDN'’T LIKE STANLEY DOING HIS JOBS. OR PULLING HIS PASSENGER CARS OR BEING EVERYONE'’S BEST FRIEND. BUT LAUGHING IN HIS BERTH AT TIDMOUTH SHEDS WAS WORST OF ALL! "I HAVE TO GET BACK TO GREAT WATERTON!" HE HUFFED. "I HAVE WORK TO DO." AND HE CHUFFED QUICKLY AWAY. THOMAS WISHED STANLEY HAD NEVER COME TO SODOR. [ Chug-Chug-Chug-Chug... ] THE NEXT DAY, THOMAS WAS EXTRA BUSY. HE WANTED EVERYONE TO SEE HE WAS BETTER THAN STANLEY. [ Wheesh! ] THOMAS COLLECTED JACK.

"AND MONTY AND MAX ARE DUMPING SUCH HEAVY LOADS, THEY'’RE GETTING DIZZY!" THOMAS SMILED. HE LIKED BEING IN CHARGE. THOMAS WANTED TO SHOW EVERYONE HE COULD DO EVERYTHING! [ Chug-Chug-Chug-Chug... ] NEXT, HE WAS PULLING SOME HEAVY FREIGHT CARS. THEN THERE WAS TROUBLE. THOMAS WAS PUFFING TOO FAST ROUND THE BEND. HE TOPPLED OFF THE TRACK! [ Crash! ] HIS LOAD CRASHED DOWN THE BANK! "OH, NO!" CRIED THOMAS. LUCKILY, NO ONE WAS HURT. SIR TOPHAM HATT ARRIVED WITH EDWARD AND ROCKY. HE WAS CROSS. "THOMAS, YOU MUST GO TO THE REPAIR YARD." THOMAS DIDN'’T WANT TO GO TO THE REPAIR YARD. HE WANTED TO STAY IN CHARGE. "STANLEY WILL TAKE YOUR PLACE IN CHARGE OF THE WORK AT GREAT WATERTON," ADDED SIR TOPHAM HATT. THIS WAS THE WORST NEWS EVER FOR THOMAS! HE WAS SO UPSET! ROCKY LOWERED THOMAS ONTO EDWARD'’S FLATBED. SLOWLY, EDWARD PUFFED AWAY FROM GREAT WATERTON. EDWARD HAD TO STOP AT A SIGNAL. STANLEY CHUFFED CHEERFULLY TOWARDS THEM. "BAD LUCK, THOMAS!" HE WHISTLED AND HE PUFFED AWAY. IN THE DISTANCE THEY COULD HEAR THE OTHER ENGINES CHEER. "WELCOME, STANLEY!" THOMAS WAS CROSS. "I FOUND GREAT WATERTON," HE HOOTED. "I'’LL BE BACK! "I'’LL BE IN CHARGE AGAIN! THEN EVERYONE WILL SEE I'’M MORE USEFUL THAN STANLEY!" EDWARD'’S SIGNAL CHANGED TO GO AND HE PUFFED ON. SOON, THOMAS WAS AS GOOD AS NEW! "NOW I CAN GET BACK TO MY JOB AT GREAT WATERTON," HE TOOTED. THOMAS COULDN'’T WAIT. HE CHUFFED CHEERILY OUT OF THE REPAIR YARD.

"STANLEY HAS GIVEN ME EXTRA JOBS "BECAUSE HE SAYS I GIVE VERY SMOOTH RIDES!" PEEPED PERCY PROUDLY. "TOMORROW, STANLEY AND I ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER ON THE TOWER!" THOMAS DIDN'’T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT STANLEY. HE WAS UPSET. NEXT, THOMAS FOUND JACK, MONTY AND MAX. THEY WERE VERY BUSY. "COME ON, MONTY AND MAX, LET'’S MAKE STANLEY PROUD!" JACK CRIED. "HE'’S ASKED US TO FILL IN THREE HOLES AND WE'’VE ONLY FILLED IN ONE." "HELLO!" TOOTED THOMAS. BUT JACK, MONTY AND MAX WERE TOO BUSY TO NOTICE HIM. THOMAS WAS EVEN MORE UPSET. HE FELT AS IF HE DIDN'’T MATTER AT ALL. HE PUFFED SADLY AWAY. BUT THOMAS FORGOT ALL ABOUT FEELING SAD WHEN HE CHUFFED INTO GREAT WATERTON STATION. IT WAS STARTING TO LOOK AS IT MUST HAVE DONE LONG AGO. "BUBBLING BOILERS!" HE CRIED. "THIS IS VERY EXCITING!" THEN THOMAS SAW STANLEY. HE WAS WITH SIR TOPHAM HATT. SIR TOPHAM HATT SAW THOMAS. "COME HERE!" HE BOOMED. [ Toot-Toot! ] "HELLO, THOMAS!" STEAMED STANLEY. [ Toot-Toot! ] THOMAS TOOTED BACK. BUT VERY QUIETLY. "STANLEY HAS DONE A GOOD JOB. WORK IS MOVING FAST," SIR TOPHAM HATT DECLARED. "SO I HAVE DECIDED," HE ADDED, "THAT STANLEY WILL STAY IN CHARGE AND YOU WILL HELP HIM." THOMAS'’ FUNNEL FLATTENED! STANLEY WAS TO STAY IN CHARGE? THOMAS HAD LOST THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB OF ALL! THE JOB HE WANTED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE! THAT AFTERNOON, STANLEY ASKED THOMAS TO SHUNT SOME FREIGHT CARS. "YOU'’RE THE BEST SHUNTER EVER, THOMAS!" STANLEY CHUFFED CHEERILY. "I WILL BE BACK FOR THE FREIGHT CARS VERY SOON." THOMAS WAS VERY GOOD AT SHUNTING FREIGHT CARS AND HE ALSO REALLY LIKED SHUNTING FREIGHT CARS. BUT HE DIDN'’T REALLY LIKE STANLEY TELLING HIM WHAT TO DO. THOMAS CHUFFED UNHAPPILY TO THE FREIGHT CARS. HE WANTED THINGS BACK THE WAY THEY WERE... BEFORE STANLEY HAD ARRIVED ON THE ISLAND. THOMAS SHUNTED LOTS OF FREIGHT CARS. STANLEY HAD TO TAKE THEM UP THE STEEP HILL OUT OF THE TOWN TO THE WHARF. SUDDENLY, AN IDEA FLEW INTO THOMAS'’ FUNNEL. "IF I SHUNT AN EXTRA LONG LINE OF FREIGHT CARS STANLEY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO PULL THEM!" HE PUFFED TO HIMSELF. "EVERYONE WILL SEE HE'’S NOT SO STRONG AFTER ALL! THEN I WILL BE IN CHARGE AGAIN!" SOON, THE CARS WERE READY. THEY WERE VERY, VERY HEAVY. [ Toot-Toot-Toot! ] STANLEY CHUFFED BACK. "MY! THAT'’S A LONG TRAIN!" HE PUFFED. "NOT FOR A STRONG ENGINE LIKE YOU!" TOOTED THOMAS. BUT THOMAS KNEW IT WAS TOO LONG AND TOO HEAVY! [♪ Music ♪] STANLEY STARTED UP THE HILL. IT WAS VERY STEEP. STANLEY WAS DOING HIS BEST. STANLEY WAS USING ALL HIS HUFF AND ALL HIS PUFF. THE TRUCKS CLANKED AND CREAKED. THE TRAIN WAS FAR TOO HEAVY! STANLEY'’S WHEELS SPUN AND SLID. SUDDENLY THE COUPLING SNAPPED AND STANLEY'’S TRUCKS ROLLED AWAY... FASTER AND FASTER! THE ENGINES GASPED AS STANLEY'’S TRAIN CAME RACING DOWN THE HILL! IT SMASHED INTO THE TOWER! [ Crash! ] AS THE TOWER CRASHED TO THE GROUND, BRICKS AND DUST EXPLODED EVERYWHERE! ALL THE HARD WORK WAS WASTED. THE ENGINES GASPED IN HORROR. AND THOMAS FELT WORST OF ALL. HE KNEW IT WAS ALL HIS FAULT. SIR TOPHAM HATT AND MISS JENNY CAME TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPENED. "THIS IS A DISASTER!" BOOMED SIR TOPHAM HATT. "THOMAS," HE ASKED, "WHY DID YOU SHUNT SO MANY FREIGHT CARS FOR STANLEY?" THOMAS FELT TERRIBLE. HE KNEW WHY HE HAD DONE IT, BUT HE COULDN'’T TELL SIR TOPHAM HATT AND THE OTHER ENGINES. HE FELT TOO ASHAMED. SO, HE SAID NOTHING. SIR TOPHAM HATT WAS VERY CROSS. THE OTHER ENGINES STARTED TO WHISPER. "THOMAS DOESN'’T LIKE STANLEY," SNORTED JAMES. "THAT'’S WHY HE SHUNTED TOO MANY FREIGHT CARS FOR HIM." "WHY WOULD THOMAS DO SUCH A THING?" ASKED TOBY. "THOMAS WOULD NEVER DO THAT," PEEPED PERCY. BUT HE WAS WORRIED. THOMAS FELT VERY BAD. HE PUFFED SLOWLY AWAY. [ Brakes Wheesh! ] THOMAS FOUND AN OLD TRACK. HE WANTED TO BE ALONE. "THE OTHER ENGINES DON'’T WANT ME AROUND," HE PUFFED SADLY. "THEY WISH I WASN'’T HERE AT ALL." STANLEY PUFFED TOWARDS THOMAS. HE SAW THAT THOMAS LOOKED SAD AND ALONE. "THOMAS FEELS BAD," HE CHUFFED TO HIMSELF. HE FELT VERY SORRY FOR HIM. LATER SIR TOPHAM HATT CALLED THE ENGINES TOGETHER. "NOW, GREAT WATERTON MAY NOT BE READY FOR SODOR DAY," HE ANNOUNCED STERNLY. THE ENGINES GASPED! "MISS JENNY'’S CREW WILL LOAD THE RUBBLE "INTO THE FREIGHT CARS TONIGHT. "BUT THIS MEANS EXTRA WORK FOR ALL OF YOU!" HE ADDED. "TOMORROW, YOU WILL START "TO SHUNT THE FREIGHT CARS AWAY TO THE SIDINGS." THOMAS HAD LET DOWN SIR TOPHAM HATT, HE HAD LET DOWN THE OTHER ENGINES, AND HE HAD LET HIMSELF DOWN. THE OTHER ENGINES STARTED TO CHUFF AWAY. NO ONE SPOKE TO THOMAS. HE WAS NO LONGER IN CHARGE. AND HE FELT HE WAS NO LONGER WANTED. THAT NIGHT, ALL THE OTHER ENGINES WERE ASLEEP IN THEIR SHEDS. BUT NOT THOMAS. [ Chug-Chug-Chug-Chug... ] [ Wheesh! ] JACK AND ALFIE HAD ALREADY LOADED THEIR CARS OF RUBBLE. "IF I SHUNT ALL THE FREIGHT CARS AWAY TO THE SIDINGS, "THE TRACKS WILL BE CLEAR IN THE MORNING. THEN EVERYONE WILL LIKE ME AGAIN!" THOMAS WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TO GET HIS OLD JOB BACK. SO THOMAS STARTED TO SHUNT THE FREIGHT CARS AWAY. THOMAS WORKED VERY HARD. HE FELT VERY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF. THEN THOMAS SAW ONE LAST FREIGHT CAR. IT HAD ROLLED IN FRONT OF AN OLD MINE SHAFT. "I'’LL SOON FIX THAT!" THOMAS SMILED. THEN THERE WAS TROUBLE. THOMAS BIFFED THE CAR TOO HARD! IT ROLLED FORWARD AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE MINE! "CINDERS AND ASHES!" EXCLAIMED THOMAS. "WHERE DID THAT FREIGHT CAR GO?" THOMAS ROLLED FORWARD AND PEERED INSIDE. IT WAS VERY DARK. "I MUST FINISH THE JOB!" HE HUFFED. "I'’LL SOON FIND THAT CAR." AND THOMAS PUFFED INTO THE MINE. IT WAS VERY DARK. THOMAS WAS HAPPY HE HAD A BRIGHT LAMP. HE SAW THE FREIGHT CAR ROLLING AWAY. THEN IT DISAPPEARED AROUND A BEND! "BUST MY BUFFERS!" PUFFED THOMAS. "I'’D BETTER GO AFTER IT!" THE SLOPE WAS VERY STEEP! THOMAS WHIZZED DOWN IT AND CLATTERED AROUND THE BEND! UP THOMAS WHOOSHED AND DOWN HE WHIZZED! [ Toot-Toot-Toot! ] "WHEE-HEE!" THOMAS WHISTLED. AND, "WHOAAA!" HE CRIED. IT WAS VERY SCARY, BUT IT WAS VERY EXCITING! THOMAS HAD ALMOST CAUGHT UP TO THE FREIGHT CAR. "YOU WON'’T GET AWAY FROM ME!" HE WHISTLED HAPPILY. BUT THOMAS DIDN'’T SEE THE JUNCTION AHEAD! THE FREIGHT CAR WHIZZED DOWN THE RIGHT TRACK AND THOMAS SPED DOWN THE LEFT! THOMAS HAD LOST THE RUNAWAY CAR! BUT HIS ROLLER COASTER RIDE WAS SO MUCH FUN... THOMAS SOON FORGOT ABOUT THE FREIGHT CAR! THEN THERE WAS TROUBLE. THE TUNNEL AHEAD WAS BLOCKED! "OH, NO!" CRIED THOMAS. HE APPLIED HIS BRAKES, BUT IT WAS TOO LATE! THOMAS CRASHED STRAIGHT THROUGH THE BLOCKED TUNNEL! [ Crash! Bang! ] WITH A MIGHTY SPLASH, THOMAS LANDED IN A POOL OF WATER! "OH! FRIZZLING FIREBOXES! THIS TUNNEL IS FLOODED!" HE GASPED. IT DIDN'’T FEEL FUN ANYMORE. IT FELT SCARY. "I WISH I WAS BACK AT GREAT WATERTON," HE WHEESHED QUIETLY. THOMAS DRIFTED SLOWLY FORWARD. THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO. "CINDERS AND ASHES!" THOMAS GASPED AS HE FLOATED ALONG THE TUNNEL. HE TOOTED AS LOUDLY AS HE COULD. "HELP!" HE CRIED. BUT THERE WAS NO ONE THERE TO HEAR HIS WHISTLE. "NO ONE WILL FIND ME NOW!" THOMAS WAILED. NO ONE WILL WANT TO FIND ME." [ Brakes Wheesh! ] THE NEXT MORNING, STANLEY, JAMES, GORDON, PERCY, EDWARD, HENRY, EMILY AND TOBY HAD ARRIVED FOR WORK. "WHERE'’S THOMAS?" STANLEY ASKED. THE ENGINES LOOKED... THOMAS WASN'’T THERE. THEY ALL THOUGHT HARD. NO ONE KNEW WHERE THOMAS WAS. JAMES WAS WORRIED. HE ASKED THE LITTLE ENGINES AT THE JUNCTION, "HAVE ANY OF YOU SEEN THOMAS?" JAMES PUFFED. NONE OF THE LITTLE ENGINES HAD SEEN THOMAS EITHER. PERCY CALLED JACK AND HIS TEAM TOGETHER. [ Engine Rumbling ] "WE CAN'’T FIND THOMAS," PERCY PEEPED. "DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE'’S GONE?" JACK AND HIS TEAM THOUGHT HARD. BUT NONE OF THEM HAD SEEN THOMAS. THOMAS DRIFTED ALONG THE TUNNEL, HE REALIZED HE WAS MOVING FASTER. "BUST MY BUFFERS!" HE CRIED AS HE RACED THROUGH THE TUNNEL. SIR TOPHAM HATT WAS CALLED. "SIR, THOMAS HAS DISAPPEARED," EDWARD PUFFED. "NO ONE KNOWS WHERE HE IS!" WHISTLED EMILY. "AND I MISS HIM!" PEEPED PERCY. "THIS IS VERY STRANGE," BOOMED SIR TOPHAM HATT.

AND HE REMEMBERED THE EVENING AT TIDMOUTH SHEDS. WHEN THOMAS WAS UPSET BECAUSE STANLEY WAS IN HIS BERTH. THEN, STANLEY REMEMBERED THOMAS'’ FACE AFTER THE ACCIDENT. "THOMAS ISN'’T A BAD ENGINE; HE'’S A SAD ENGINE," STANLEY PUFFED SLOWLY. "I WONDER IF HE HAS RUN AWAY "BECAUSE HE THINKS NO ONE LIKES HIM ANYMORE. "MAYBE THOMAS IS HIDING UP IN THE HIDDEN HILLS. "I'’LL LOOK FOR HIM THERE. I MUST TELL HIM WE ALL MISS HIM." AND STANLEY WHOOSHED AWAY TO THE HILLS. IN THE DARK TUNNEL, THOMAS WAS VERY SCARED. HE WAS WASHED AND WAVED FORWARD.

THEN, THOMAS TOLD STANLEY ALL ABOUT HIS ADVENTURE IN THE MINE. STANLEY WAS AMAZED! "STANLEY," TOOTED THOMAS. "I'’M SORRY THAT I WAS HORRIBLE TO YOU. "I WAS WRONG. "AND I WAS SILLY TO BE CROSS THAT YOU WERE IN CHARGE. I WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND." STANLEY SMILED. "THOMAS!" HE WHEESHED, "WE WILL BE FRIENDS. AND I'’LL HAVE YOU BACK ON THAT TRACK IN NO TIME!" [ Chains Clatter ] SOON, STANLEY WAS HOOKED UP TO THOMAS. [ Wheesh! ] THEN STANLEY HUFFED AND PUFFED. THOMAS WAS VERY HEAVY. THERE WAS A LOT OF WATER IN HIS FIREBOX. STANLEY DIDN'’T GIVE UP. "I CAN DO IT!" HE WHEESHED. AND WITH A MIGHTY HEAVE, STANLEY PULLED HIS FRIEND BACK ONTO THE TRACK! "HOORAY!" TOOTED THOMAS. THEN THERE WAS A VERY LOUD CRACK! THE VALVE IN STANLEY'’S BOILER HAD BURST! STANLEY WAS A VERY STRONG ENGINE, BUT PULLING THOMAS HAD BEEN TOO MUCH! NOW, HE COULDN'’T MOVE! STANLEY FELT VERY SAD. "DON'’T WORRY!" WHISTLED THOMAS. "IT'’S MY TURN TO HELP YOU! I'’LL SHUNT YOU HOME." STANLEY SMILED. THOMAS WAS HIS NEW FRIEND. THERE WAS NOTHING THOMAS WOULDN'’T DO FOR STANLEY. THE FIREMEN PUT STANLEY'’S DRY COAL INTO THOMAS'’ FIREBOX. IN NO TIME AT ALL, THOMAS'’ BOILER WAS BUBBLING AND HIS STEAM WAS WHEESHING. "HERE WE GO, STANLEY!" THOMAS HUFFED HAPPILY. STANLEY SMILED BACK. AND PUFF BY PUFF THOMAS SHUNTED STANLEY ALONG THE TRACK. [ Chug-Chug-Chug-Chug... ] IT WAS VERY HARD WORK. THOMAS HAD TO PUFF UP HILLS AND HUFF THROUGH BUSHES. BUT THOMAS DIDN'’T MIND. HE WAS PROUD TO PUSH HIS NEW FRIEND STANLEY HOME. AT LAST, THOMAS AND STANLEY PUFFED INTO GREAT WATERTON. THOMAS WAS TIRED, BUT HE HAD NEVER FELT HAPPIER! HENRY, ROCKY, EDWARD AND EMILY WERE BUSY WORKING. THEY TOOTED AND WHISTLED WHEN THEY SAW THOMAS AND STANLEY AND SOON THE SOUND OF ENGINE'’S WHISTLES WERE ECHOING AROUND GREAT WATERTON!

PERCY TOLD GORDON AND TOBY AND JAMES! "MY BEST FRIEND IS FOUND!" PERCY PROUDLY EXCLAIMED. ARTHUR TOLD EMILY ALONG THE COAST TRACK. "HAVE YOU HEARD THE NEWS, THOMAS IS BACK!" MISS JENNY TOLD JACK... AND JACK TOLD HIS TEAM. "HOORAY AND HURRAH!" THEY SHOUTED AND SCREAMED. HAROLD TOUCHED DOWN AND FOUND BERTIE THE BUS. BERTIE HOOTED AND TOOTED AND MADE SUCH A FUSS! BERTIE FOUND LADY HATT, WHO WHOOPED AND WAVED. LADY HATT TOLD HER HUSBAND, "SODOR IS SAVED!" "THOMAS IS FOUND!" CRANKED CRANKY ALOUD. THE CHEERS AND THE CHEERING WERE A MARVELOUS SOUND! SIR TOPHAM HATT PROCLAIMED VERY GRANDLY, "STANLEY SAVED THOMAS AND THOMAS SAVED STANLEY!" NEXT MORNING, THOMAS PUFFED INTO GREAT WATERTON. PERCY AND STANLEY WERE WORKING HARD HELPING TO REBUILD THE TOWER. IT WAS ALMOST FINISHED. THOMAS SMILED. NOW HE WAS HAPPY STANLEY HAD COME TO SODOR. HE HAD SO MANY WONDERFUL FRIENDS. "HOW COULD I EVER HAVE WANTED TO BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY OF THEM?" HE PUFFED TO HIMSELF. NOW THEY ALL WORKED HAPPILY TOGETHER. LATER SIR TOPHAM HATT ARRIVED. THE TOWER WAS FINISHED! IT LOOKED MAGNIFICENT! "WELL DONE TO YOU ALL!" BEAMED SIR TOPHAM HATT. "GREAT WATERTON IS NOW READY FOR SODOR DAY!" "PLEASE, SIR," TOOTED THOMAS. "MAY STANLEY BRING THE MAYOR TO THE OPENING?" "THAT WAS YOUR SPECIAL, THOMAS," SAID SIR TOPHAM HATT. "ARE YOU SURE?" "OH YES, SIR," THOMAS SMILED. "SURER THAN SURE!" SODOR DAY ARRIVED! STANLEY CHUFFED PROUDLY IN WITH THE MAYOR. THOMAS WAS PLEASED FOR HIS FRIEND. THE MAYOR, SIR TOPHAM HATT AND LADY HATT STOOD BY THE NEW TOWER. "GREAT WATERTON IS NO LONGER LOST!" "WELCOME TO THE TOWN OF GREAT WATERTON!" THEN, EVERYONE LOOKED UP. THEY COULD HEAR THE WHIRR OF A JET PLANE. IT WAS JEREMY! HE FLEW HIGH IN THE SKY AND OVER THE TOWN OF GREAT WATERTON! [ Engines Tooting ] ALL THE ENGINES WHISTLED AND WHEESHED. JACK AND HIS TEAM CHEERED AND EVERYONE CLAPPED! [ Cheers & Applause ] [ Toot-Toot! Toot-Toot! ] THOMAS SMILED.
