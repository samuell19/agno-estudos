[THUNDER] [KIDS SINGING JOHN JACOB JINGLEHEIMER SCHMIDT] [THUNDER] [KIDS SINGING] -Thank god. OK, kids. We're almost there. [KIDS SINGING] [TRAIN HORN] -It's not working. [TRAIN HORN] -The crossing guard, it's not working. [KIDS SINGING] [TRAIN HORN] [SHOUTING] [KIDS SINGING] [SCREAMING] [KIDS SINGING AND PEOPLE SCREAMING] [TRAIN HORN] [SCREAMING AND CRASHING] -The bus was torn to pieces. None of the kids survived the accident. -Crystal, you are so full of shit. All of the kids died? -It's totally true. Melanie, bodies were everywhere. And body parts. -That's terrible, especially for such a small town. -They say if you park your car at the spot where it happened and put it in neutral, it moves by itself. -Ohh. -Pushed over the tracks to safety by the ghosts of the dead children. -Can you say urban legend? -I swear, it's true. I hate to say it, but that accident is the only thing this town has going for it. -Well, anything's better than rehab. -Yeah, except for moving back in with mom and dad in some lame ghost town. Let me know if you want me to take you back to the airport. -No. I mean, it's time I get back to reality. -Melanie, can I ask you something? -Of course. -What was it like? -Rehab? You know, it wasn't the typical melodrama you would think. You just spend a lot of time in the mountains, hiking, learning how to survive. Someday I want to go, just you and me in the mountains. -That sounds like a plan. Here we are. -Where? -This is where it happened. -These are the train tracks? -Yep. -Yeah. -Now, we're going to try a little experiment. -OK. -Let's see if it really works. -Hmmm. Wow, we're really moving. -Patience, little sister. [TRUCK HONKING] [SCREAMING] -Come on. Move it! -OK, asshole! -Damn kids. -There you go. [GRUNTS] -Hey, there she is. Look at this. Oh, you look great. -Hi. -Oh. What do you think of this house? Nice, huh? -It's huge. -That's one benefit of moving out of the city. Really good to see you, Mel. We missed you. -Me, too, daddy. -Hello, Melanie. You're looking well. -Hi, mom. It's good to see you. -How are you doing? -I'm fine. -I know this is probably a big change for you. -It's OK. I'm glad I wasn't here while you guys were moving. I hate moving. -Well, it's been a big change for all of us. But I think we can be happy here. Do you think you could be happy here? -I don't know. I've only been here three minutes. -You know what I mean. -Hey, let me-- let me take you inside. Come on. You're gonna love it. Home sweet home. -Wow. It's nice. -Your room's right up here, honey. Here we are. Where-- where's my computer? -We didn't think it was a good idea for you to have one right now. -How am I supposed to do my homework? On an abacus? -Use your sister's computer for now. -Dinner will be ready in about 30 minutes. -You know, the guy at the store said you can only use so many minutes a month. So I guess use it wisely. Gotta built-in camera. -Thanks, dad. -Oh, it's good to see you. Oh. And, uh, don't tell mom about the cell phone. -Don't worry about it. [SIGHS] [CHUCKLE] -You wanna get high? -Yeah. What is that? -It's chiva. It's incredible. -Heroin? Are you kidding me? I'm not shooting up. -You don't have to. Trust me. You won't-- you won't be sorry. -Shawn. Shawn. Shawn. Shawn! -It took about three years for total construction. Now, normally it would take longer. But we're laying the turnpike right over the existing train track route. So we don't expect to relocate any of the properties. -Well, that sounds wonderful. Congratulations, dad. -Yeah. Well, it's not like I designed it. I mean, this job was supposed to have been done in the late '50s. But they put it back until now. That's more than 40 years later. -Bureaucracy at its finest. Maybe the haunted train track scared everyone away. -Melanie, please don't start trashing the place so soon. -I was kidding. -So, now that you're back, have you given any thought to your future? -Mom, she just got here. -Thank you, Crystal. I'm well aware of that. Well, Melanie? -I hear the, uh, state school has an excellent dance program. -Dad. -You made a beautiful ballerina. -That was five years ago. -Which is all the more reason to get back into it. -Ballet is for kids, mom. -Well, don't tell the Russians that. I mean, they love ballet. -Melanie, all I'm saying is that idle hands do the devil's work. You should know that better than anyone. Don't go after her, Edward. She knows I'm right. -(WHISPERING)Mel. Mel. Come on. -Where are we going? -Out. -I don't think that's such a good idea. [SHUSHING] -Come on. -See you later. -Hey, Crystal. -Hey, Crystal. PARTY-GOERS (OFFSCREEN): Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. -What's up? -Three. Two. One. [CHEERING] -You're up. -Ohhh!!! -Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. [CHEERING] -Oh, fuck. -You OK with this? -Yeah. Just say no. Right? -Go fist yourself. [LAUGHING] -That's Mitch. [JEERING] -Thirteen. Twelve. Eleven. [MUSIC PLAYING] -There he is. Penn! Hey, Penn. Come here. Hey. -What's up, ladies? -Penn, this is my little sister. -How's it going? -Hi. I'm Melanie. -You know, uh, our dads are working on the highway project together. -Oh. -I guess that means we'll be hanging out. Right, Crystal? -Hell yeah. -Can I get you ladies a drink? -Sure. -Melanie, you thirsty? -Um, maybe something nonalcoholic. -OK. Cool. Chucky! Two beers, s'il vous plait, and a club soda. -Two brews coming up. [CHEERING AND CLAPPING] -There you go. There you go. Crazy bastard. [LAUGHING] -(SIGHING) Thank you. -Appreciate it, man. -All right. -Hey, where's the bathroom? -Through the kitchen, to the left. -OK. Thank you. Hold my purse. -Cute. -Ah-ha. You kinda like her. -All right! -So I don't know if you knew this. [VOMITING] [KNOCKING] -Go away! -You want some of this? -Aww, prude! Come on. Hey! -Don't talk like that, shit breath. Come on, man. -Great. [SIGHS] -Club soda? -Thank you. -Of course. So how does your sister like Emerald? -I took Melanie by the railroad crossing, but she didn't believe in the story about the dead children. I mean, we went to the train tracks. And we tried it, but it didn't work. I don't know. I still believe it. -I don't know. -Sorry. -Melanie, right? -Yeah. -Can I ask you something? -Sure. -Is it true you OD'd? You like died and came back to life? -Who told you that? -(LAUGHS) So it is true. Freak. [LAUGHING] -What's up, baby? -Can I talk to you? -Sure. -Are you fucking telling people? -Telling people what? -About rehab. -No! Yes. Just Penn and maybe Mitch. -Well, now barf butt knows, too. So apparently everyone in town knows. -I'm sorry. I only told because-- -I don't care. -Don't worry. Rehab's the in thing. -Yeah, and next year it'll be bulimia. -I'm really sorry. Do you want me to take you home? -No. I don't want to ruin your night. -I just want you to have fun. -Anybody want to go for a ride? -Let's do it. [LOUD MUSIC] -Why are we letting the drunkest one of us drive? -Actually, he's the only one who won't get busted. His uncle's chief of police. -Right. -Yow! Woo-hoo! [SCREECHING TIRES] -Uh, I think you have to stop before the actual tracks, Mitch. -Mmmm. Baby powder is a necessity. -How many times have you done this? -First time. -Seriously? -Seriously. Melanie, we're not as backward as you might think. -Hmm. -Bastard. -Well, uh, most of us. Mitch has done this before. I don't believe in ghosts. -Neither do I. What is he doing? -The legend says if you put powder on the bumper, you'll see the fingerprints of the dead children, but only if you truly believe. -I'll believe it when I see it. -I guess we're about to find out. [WHISTLING] [SIGHING] -This will be fucking awesome! They're coming for you, Melanie. Ooooo! -Leave her alone. -Relax. Just playing. Here we go. Come on, you little fuckers. -Nothing's happening, Mitch. -What a surprise. -All right. Give it a minute. [TRAIN HORN] -Ah, OK. The ghosts are sleeping. Let's go. [TRAIN HORN] [CROSSING BELL] -Come on. I'm serious. -They will push us when the train gets closer. -That's bullshit. -Come on, Mitch. -Let's go. [TRAIN HORN] -This isn't funny. -Don't be a dickhead, Mitch. Move the car! -What the hell are you doing? Come on! -Screw this. -What the hell are you doing, Mitch? Move the car! -Unlock the fucking doors, Mitch. -Non-believers! -This isn't funny, Mitch! -They'll push us when the train gets closer! -Come on! [SCREAMING] -They're gonna push us! -Mitch, let me out of the car! [SCREAMING] -This isn't funny! Let's go! -Let me out of the car! Let me out of the car! [SCREAMING] -Noooo! [SCREECHING TIRES] [SCREECHING TIRES] -That's what I'm talking about. -You asshole! -Woo-hoo! -Fucking ass. Man, what's your problem? -Hey, man. Fucking relax. Jesus. Fucking chill out. -Where is she? Did you guys see her? Shit. -She is nuts. -What the fuck? -Little girl! Little girl! -Melanie, where are you going? -Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Hello? Hello? Don't be afraid. Hello? Little girl! -Hey. You OK? -What are you doing over here? This place is creepy. -Didn't you see the little girl? -Hello? Mr. Pearl! Mr. Pearl! -Dude. Enough. -Who's Mr. Pearl? -Oh, he used to be the train conductor that ran this depot. -Now, his ghost haunts it. -After the bus crashed Mr. Pearl hung himself right here in the depot. They say he felt the accident was his fault. -Well, maybe we should go inside. -Hell no. [GASPS] -It's him! -Hey! You kids shouldn't be here. This place is condemned. [LAUGHING] -What's so funny? He's an old man. -That's Fuzzy Keeler, the town drunk. -Of course. -Our parents said if we drank and did drugs, we'd end up like Old Fuzzy Keeler. -Ahhh. -You don't scare us, bum. I gotta take a leak. -Let's get out of here. [SIGHS AND WHISTLES] -You know what? I'm driving. -Is he waiting for another girl? -I guess so. -Hey. I ran out before I finished the H. Heh. [ZIPPER___CLOSING] [SIRENS] -No. No. Shawn. Shawn. Shawn. -Please, miss. Lie down. -Shawn. No. Shawn, Shawn, Shawn. -We're losing her. We're losing her! [BEEP] [ALARM BUZZING] -School. Ahh. Fuck. [KIDS TALKING] -Hey, check it out. -Fresh meat. -I hate football. -Shut up. -Screw her. [BELL RINGING] -Mr. Perrywine? -Yes. -Um, I'm Melanie Wood. The office told me to report to you. -Well, yes. Melanie. Been expecting you. Please, have a seat. -Haven't been here five minutes, and they already have me on the couch. -(LAUGHING) It's not like that. -Who's your friend? -My CPR dummy. I teach first response. -Jack of all trades. Your family looks nice, Mr. Perrywine. -Call me Doug. Yeah. Thanks. I love my kids. -And your wife? -Well, before we get into me, uh, I want you to know that your parents filled me in on everything that happened. The loss of a close friend is really tough. Melanie, it's OK. I'm not here to judge or preach. I mean, we do have a zero-tolerance policy on substance use. But I know that's not going to be a problem. This may be a little ambitious, but I think we could be friends. -That's exactly what my last counselor said. -And? -He tried to fuck me, so I kicked him in the balls. -Yeah. Your mother told me about your penchant for telling lies. -Well, you just know everything, don't you? -No. But I do know one thing. If you trust me, I'll never betray you. It's the least I can do. [SIGHS] -My wife and I have been separated since the day I found her in bed with the neighbor. -Doug, that's a little more than I needed to know. -Sorry. I just want you to trust me. -Sure. -Dig it. So what's your first class? -English Lit. -Hmm. Great. I'll walk you there. -It's really not necessary. -Oh, I know. It's my first class, too. -Oh. -All right, scholars. We have a new inmate today. Everyone please welcome Ms. Melanie Wood. Melanie, would you like to tell us a little something about yourself? -Well, my name is Melanie Wood. You probably already know my sister, Crystal. -Hottie. [LAUGHING] -That's enough, Mitch. Melanie, please. Continue. -I am, well, starting school here late because my dad's work relocated. And he wanted to take me to the Himalayas to hike in the mountains. We had an amazing time, and I would recommend it to anyone. -Rehab. [LAUGHING] -Get out of my classroom. -What? -I'm serious. Now. -(WHISPERING) You're mine. -Anyone else? All right then. What I'd like to discuss today is the relationship between the children and their caregiver in "The Turn of the Screw." So, please, everybody, take out your books. Turn to page 53. -[INAUDIBLE] -Woo! -Fuck! -Hi. We all wanted you to know that we're keeping an eye on you. After last night you're all Mitch talks about. So you've been warned, freak. Come on. -Tough first day? -It's amazing. New town, same bitches. [LAUGHS] -When are we getting out of here? -I'm gonna hang for a bit. But why don't you take my car if you want? My keys are in my locker. -OK. -All right. I'll see you later. -I can't believe I'm doing this. [GASP] -Oh my god. [GASP] -Oh my god. Hi. Can I help you? Um, are you lost? No? Um, do you need a ride home? Here, you can get in back. Wow. You're quick. OK. So which way do I go? All right. You got it. I've seen you playing around here before. So what's your name? Julie? That's a pretty name. I'm Melanie. You don't talk much, do you, Julie? Is that where you live? Are you OK? God, you're really shivering. Here. Here. Put on my jacket. Here you go. Are your parents home? Well, do you want me to wait with you? Hey, Julie. Julie, where you going? Julie? [CROSSING BELL] -Mind if I join you? -I'm kind of having some alone time. -What is it? Like a moment of silence or something? -More like an hour. -Fuck. Who died? -You know, you don't have to feel sorry for me. -I don't know what you're talking about. -Oh, you don't, do you? -I know why you have this aura about you. -Really? You don't strike me as the aura-reading type. -Crystal told you that she told me, didn't she? -Can you say that three times fast? Yes. I know that you know. -About your boyfriend, about what happened? -See. This is why I need alone time. How many people have you told? -I just want to let you know that you're not the only one. -What do you mean? -I lost my older brother a little over a year ago. They found him in his dorm room. He OD'd. -I'm sorry. That's terrible. -That's just between you and me. -You haven't told anybody? -I told you. -Hey, Penn. Thanks. -Any time. -Hello? So much for hidden treasure. Andrew Pearl must vacate? [TAP] -Hello? Mr. Keeler? Julie? Do I know you? [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] -God. That's not funny, asshole. -You know, I thought I saw you slip in here. What's this? -Give it back. [TAUNTING LAUGH] -What would you do for it? -Give it back. -Get it. -Give it back. -What would you do for it? -I am not in the mood for your games. Could you please give it back? -Come and get it. -That's bullshit. -Hey. Hey. Come here. -No, Mitch. -Come here. -Stop it. -Come on. I want to talk to you. -Mitch, let me go! -I want to show you something. Come here. -Let go of me, Mitch! -Shh. Stop it! -Shh. -Let go of me! -Shh. -Mitch, stop it! Stop it! Someone help me! Help me! Get off of me! Stop! -Shh. -Stop it! -Ow, fuck! -Hey! -Shh. Shh. Shh. What the fuck you looking at, huh? -God. -Fuck! I gotta go back to the same old pussy. -Glad I could help. -Fuck off. -Hey, save some for me. What? Hey, I got an idea. [ZIPPER OPENS] -Smoke that. What the fuck is this? -That's, um, something that didn't pan out. Back to work. Who the fuck is that? -Huh? -Keeler. -What? -That motherfucking bum. [GASP] -I'm gonna kick his ass. Come on, bitch. -MITCH(OFFSCREEN): Woo! Come on, motherfucker! Come on! -Mitch? Mitch! Mitch! [THUMP] [GASPS] Mitch! [THUMPING] [SCREAMING] -No! [SCREAMING] -FEMALE SPEAKER(OFFSCREEN): All right. Hands up. Hands up. All the way up. -There is no way I can climb this rope. -Oh, don't worry about it. We used to do this stuff all the time in rehab. -Have you seen my tan jacket, by the way? I thought it was in my car. -Oh, I lent it to a little girl. Don't worry about it. I'll get it back. Watch and learn. See, the trick is everyone says it's in the arms. But it's all in the legs. -Whatever you say. [GRUNTING] -Mel, you're doing great. [GASPS] [SCREAM] FEMALE SPEAKER(OFFSCREEN): Oh my god. Give her some room. -Mel, are you OK? FEMALE SPEAKER(OFFSCREEN): Back up. Back up. Don't move her. -Melanie, can you hear me? Somebody go get a nurse. -FEMALE SPEAKER(OFFSCREEN): Don't touch her. OK. Melanie, are you with me? Melanie, are you OK? DOUG(OFFSCREEN):Took quite a fall. -Doug, can I tell you something? -Yeah. What's up? -I, um-- I didn't just fall. There was something written on the ceiling in blood. -What was it? -Andrew Pearl. -Melanie, you took a bad fall. Something like that can cause your brain-- -No, Doug. Listen. Have you ever been down to the train tracks? -I've driven by them a million times. -Have you ever, you know, put your car in neutral and-- -No. I haven't. But I know that spot has become popular with teenagers and ghost seekers. -It works. I've done it. My sister's car was pushed across the tracks by something. The children. Or maybe it was the ghost of Andrew Pearl. -Well, I see you've been brought up to speed on our local folklore. -I know how this sounds. -Melanie, listen to me. It's sad that the Pearl's tragedy has become gossip and rumor. If you have any respect for the dead, please, don't help spread this nonsense around. -But my car moved by itself across the tracks. -A terrible accident happened many years ago, and I think this town needs to move on. Heck, I'd even vote to change the street names if it would help us forget. -Wait. Street names? -Every child that died in that accident had a street named after him or her. Once the new turnpike comes in, the entire tracks and that story will be a thing of the past. They will finally rip those godforsaken tracks up for good. -My dad said the track was supposed to be torn up in the '50s. Something made it postpone. I was down at the depot. I got some old permits and papers. -Melanie, stay away from there. OK? It's dangerous. To be continued? -Sure. But remember, trust. -OK. Come on in. -Hi, Mr. Perrywine. I'm going to drive her over to the doctor's now. -Thanks, Crystal. See you later, Melanie. -Yeah. Right over here. Pull over. -Who lives here? -A little girl I lent your jacket to. Don't you want it back? -Yes. -Well, then give me a second. -All right. [DOORBELL] -Can I help you? -Um, hi. Um, yeah. I was looking for a girl named Julie. -Julie? -Yeah. -I think you have the wrong house. -No. I'm-- that's strange, because I dropped a little girl off here. And she accidentally ran away with my sister's jacket. Are you sure there are no Julies around the neighborhood? -No. So if you don't mind, I'm going to get back to my business. -I'm so sorry for bothering you. Yes. Of course. -How I wish this would all stop. -Excuse me? -I had a sister named Julie. She died many years ago. If I had a penny for every teenager that came to disrespect me and my family-- aren't there better things to do in the world? -I am so sorry. I-- I honestly had no idea. -He put you up to this, didn't he? Well, you can tell him he should be ashamed! -What happened to my sister? -Well, I-- I was passing by, saw the situation, thought I'd give Crystal the night off, take you home myself. [CELL PHONE RINGING] -Oh. Sorry. -That's all right. -Huh. Oh boy. -Hop in, cowgirl. PENN(OFFSCREEN): So what are you going to do after graduation? -I haven't a clue. Probably go up to the mountains, though, at least for awhile. You? -Well, uh, I wanted to head out West for school. But what happened to my brother, my dad was like, no way. -That sucks. -Yeah. He's a little overprotective. -Ha. Tell me about it. Where out West did you want to go? -California. San Diego, actually. Yeah. Back in the day, I could have hopped a train and been there in no time. -I'm from California, you know. -I know. What? -Um, can I ask you a question? -Sure. -I told you that Mr. Pearl killed himself. -Oh, jeez. Come on. Is that why you were at Mary Pearl's house? -Mary Pearl? -Yeah. The conductor's daughter, that was her house. -I had no idea. Well, who told you about the suicide? -I-- I-- I guess my grandfather, but everyone knows. Can we please talk about something else? -In a second. In a second. Is your grandfather still alive? I'd like to talk to him. -No. Melanie, he's dead. All right? Just like Mr. Pearl, just like the kids on the school bus, just like we'll all be someday. They're all having one hell of a time at the cemetery-- [CELL PHONE RINGING] -Shit. Shit. I have to go. -Great. [SIGHS] -Thank you. -Of course. -I'll see you tomorrow. -All right. MRS. WOOD(OFFSCREEN): Melanie, would mind coming here, please? -Hello, Melanie. -Blood on the ceiling, Melanie? Good god. -Sorry, Melanie. But it's best. I promise. -No wonder your wife fucking left you, Doug. -MRS. WOOD(OFFSCREEN): Melanie! -I'm so sorry, Mr. Perrywine. I want to thank you for stopping by. -It's no problem. Um, should I wait for your husband to get home? That way we could all sit down with Melanie together. -No. My husband has been too soft on her. I'll take care of it from here. -Of course. Well, good evening. [BRANCH SNAPPING] -I can't believe I'm doing this. [SIGHS] -(LAUGHING) This is ridiculous. [CREAKING] -Oh shit. [CREAKING] [EXHALES] -Oh my god. [KIDS SINGING JOHN JACOB JINGLEHEIMER SCHMIDT] [KIDS LAUGHING] -Melanie. (VOICE MAIL): Hi. You've reached Melanie's cell phone. I can't get to my phone. You know what to do after the beep. -Melanie, it's Doug. I know you're pretty pissed at me right now, and you have every right to be. Listen, I'm at the train tracks and-- and-- and you're right. My car was pushed across, and there-- there are all these tiny fingerprints everywhere. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I'm going back to my office. OK? Call me as soon as you get this. Bye. -Melanie, stop that. -It hurts. -I hate to be the one to say it, but I think that she should be taken out of school. -What? -I'm only going to ask you this once, so you'd better be honest. Are you on drugs again? -How can you even ask me that? -Blood on the ceiling? Falling in gym class? Ghosts at the train track? Should I go on? -She's not on drugs, mother. -Shut up, Crystal. -We're just worried about you, honey. -I know that you snuck out, and that won't happen again. -What are you doing? You're crazy! -We have to be sure. -No! I'm not on drugs! OK? -Leave her alone, mom. I was with her, and I swear we didn't touch anything. -Sit down, young lady! I will deal with you later. MELANIE(OFFSCREEN): Daddy, you're hurting me. -I'm sorry, hon. Just hold still. -(SOBBING) Stop! [SNIP] [SOBBING] -A hair test is the only way to be sure that you're drug free. [SOBBING] -You guys are fucking crazy. [CELL PHONE RINGING] [SCREAMING] [KIDS SINGING JOHN JACOB JINGLEHEIMER SCHMIDT] [SCREAMING] -She wants attention. We simply cannot indulge her. [SCREAMING] [KNIFE SLICING] [SCREAMING] -Melanie! Melanie! Open this door. Melanie, open this door! [SCREAMING] -Melanie! Open this door! [SCREAM] -Melanie! [SCREAM] -Oh my god. [SOBBING] -What did you do? Melanie. Melanie, you're bleeding. We have to get you to the hospital. Who-- who wrote that? -Julie. -You're scaring the shit out of me. -You're scared? What about me? -I have to get this off before mom sees it. Oh god. -Crystal, the ghost children, they're real. I can see them. -What are you talking about? -Ever since my overdose, I can see things. People. I think this little girl needs my help. -Oh my god. [SOBBING] [SIGHS] [CELL_PHONE__VIBRATING] [SNORTS] -Yeah. Right. [GLASS BREAKING] -Hello? Hello? Bonnie, you cleaning up? What the-- [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] [GASP] -Shit. Yeah, Jason. What is it? JASON(ON PHONE): Hey, dad. I was wondering if you could take me to my soccer practice tomorrow. Mom says she can't take me because she has to go to that counselor. -Yeah. [SCREAMS] JASON(ON PHONE): Dad. Dad. Why are you yelling? -Ahh! [GRUNTING] -Ahh! JASON(ON PHONE): Dad. Dad. [SCREAMING] -No! No! No! No! Help! Help! No! JASON(ON PHONE) Dad? -Come on. Where are you hiding? No Pulitzer for investigative reporting here. Julie. Mary Pearl. Keeler. Fuzzy Keeler. -Scare ya? -No. Yes. -Sorry. I've been looking all over for you. What are you reading? -Oh. It's, um-- it's just for a history report. -Shit. We have a history report? -Yeah. It's due tomorrow. [LAUGHS] -What? -I was kidding. -How about we go out tonight? -Meet me at the tracks at 10:00. -Uh, sure, if that's where you want to meet. MELANIE(OFFSCREEN): Is this your father? -Yeah. There never was a kinder man than my daddy. You know what? Everything he did was for this town. You know, he was given the, uh, key to this city. I think I've got it around here somewhere. I don't know. I mean, it doesn't really open no real doors. -Mary, I do-- I do want to apologize for the misunderstanding we had yesterday. And I appreciate you-- you seeing me. -It's all right. -Do you have any, um, pictures of Julie from when she was young? -Well, my sister never really got beyond being a little girl. I've got a few. Ah. -I know it's painful. I lost someone I loved very much. -I'm sorry. -Anyway. MARY(OFFSCREEN): That's me and my daddy. -I think she's trying to tell me something about the accident or your father. -Darling, I'm not sure I follow. -I know this sounds strange, but I've seen Julie several times since I've moved here. Something is not right. She's trying to tell me something. -Well, that's enough, sweetheart. I can't play host to this. I accepted your apologies. I invited you into my house with good intentions, and now I'm going to have to ask you to leave. -This is not a prank. I swear. -You know, sometimes I wish there had been a bus crash. Show yourself out. -Mr. Pearl. Julie. What are you trying to tell me? [GASPING] -Ahh! Nice job, Mel. [SCREAMING] [KIDS SINGING JOHN JACOB JINGLEHEIMER SCHMIDT] [SCREAMING] -Help me! Help me! Someone help me! -There you go. Miss Wood? -Yes. -I'm Sheriff Kowalski. This is Deputy Reynolds. You mind coming with us back to the station so we can ask you a few questions? -About what? -About the disappearance of Mitch Keller Berenbaum and Carolyn Jessup Murphy. Come with us, please. This your jacket? -Why am I here? -Why do you think you're here, Melanie? -I don't know. Something to do with Mitch and Carolyn. -And how did you know that? -Because you told me at the cemetery. -Right. You know, I remember when my nephew helped our baseball team beat Tom's River. Advanced to the Little League World Series. -Who's your nephew? -Mitch. He's a good kid with a good future. Only a special kind of girl, a different kind of girl, could turn him into pervert like this. Girl like you. -I can't look at this. This is disgusting. -We have a couple of witnesses who saw you lead him into the old depot two days ago. We know you're the last person to see him. -I was not. Mr. Keeler was the last person to see him. -Fuzzy Keeler? [LAUGHS] -Old Keeler's been here detoxing on a drunk and disorderly. Anyone else you want to try to pin this on? -Maybe the two of them ran away. -I know my nephew. He ain't the kinda kid who would run away. You ever give him drugs? We know you have a past history of illegal activity. -Who told you that? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] -Ma'am, thank you for coming. We're just asking your daughter a few questions. The information you gave us on the phone earlier was very helpful. -Mom, what did you tell them? They're accusing me hurting kids at school. -Nobody's accusing you of anything, honey. We're just trying to get you the help you need. -Mind if I have a word with you two in private? -Of course not. -I need a refill. -Get it yourself. -(CHUCKLING) I was planning on it. Have a seat. -Sorry. -Can I get you some? -No. Thanks. MR. KEELER(OFFSCREEN SINGING): Whenever I go out, people always shout John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt. Dah dah dah dah dah dah. John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt. That's my name, too. Whenever I go out, the people always shout John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt. Dah dah dah dah dah dah dah. John Jacob. -Mr. Keeler. -Do I know you? -No. But I know who you were. You were the mayor of this town. [LAUGHS] -What happened to the kids? -What kids? There's kids all over the place. There's too many goddamn kids, if you ask me. -The bus crash. You were mayor when the train hit the bus. -Those kids. -Why are there no bodies of the children at the cemetery? -Who told you that? -It's true, isn't it? There are no bodies because the bus crash never happened. -Say, didn't I see you at the depot? -Mr. Keeler, what really happened to the kids? I know you're hiding something. Please. Kids are missing again. -You see that bag there? Hand me that bag. Oh boy. Boy, I knew this day was coming. [EXHALES] -You were right. There was no bus crash. The whole thing was a cover-up, and I was responsible. I knew that if the truth came out about the children disappearing, that whole highway project would be in jeopardy. And it was. It never got made. Everything went sour. Mr. Pearl got his wish. When the town council voted to destroy the depot, something snapped in Pearl's head. And the children went missing, and every finger pointed to him. -Did you do anything to stop him? -The police had no evidence. We had no proof. His little daughter, Julie, went missing. So we took matters into our own hands. -Did you kill him? -It was an accident. We just tried to lean on him a little bit, tried to get him to tell us where the kids were. But he never talked. He died. -And that's why the parents allowed the cover-up. -Yeah. -Were the children ever found? -No. -Mr. Keeler, what happened to the bodies? -I wish I knew. [KIDS SINGING JOHN JACOB JINGLEHEIMER SCHMIDT] -Julie? Are you in here? -What a fucking day I've been having. We have to go. Something happened. I think Crystal's in trouble. -Don't use your sister as an excuse for your own problems. -She's right, Mel. Just tell the police the truth. -Shit. -Keeler just told me the bus wreck was bullshit. Andrew Pearl killed those children, and I think it's happening again. And if you don't believe me, ask Keeler. -Chief, they just found Doug Perrywine in a dumpster behind the school. He's dead. [GASP] -Melanie! -Find out what Keeler told her. -Keeler! What the hell did you say to that girl? Oh my god. [SCREAMING] -Oh no. Oh god. Crystal! Crystal! Crystal! Crystal! Crys-- -You are going to your room for the rest of your life! -Mom, please stop! Mom, look! Look! Look! Look! Look! It's on the photo. I am not crazy. It's right there. -Where did you get this phone? -Mom, it's the hard copy! No! No! -I'm sick of your shit! -(SOBBING) No. Fuck. Come on, Julie. Where are you? Please, where are you? Where are you? Please. [WHISPERING] [WHISPERING] [KIDS SINGING JOHN JACOB JINGLEHEIMER SCHMIDT] [CROSSING BELL] [KIDS SINGING] -Shh. Shh. I think there's a train. Just sit tight. I'll be right back. [CROSSING BELL] [GASP] [CHOKING] -Daddy? -Shh. [SCREAMING] [TRAIN HORN] [DOOR CREAKING] -Mel? -Crystal? Crystal. [GASPING] -Crystal, I'm here. It's OK. It's all right. It's OK. It's OK. We're gonna get you out of here. Oh god. It's gonna be OK. Yes. It's gonna be just fine. Here you go. Come on. This way. Here you go. Crystal? -No. Crystal, who did this to you? [SCREAMING] -It's OK. It's all right. [SOBBING] -OK. Here. [SOBBING] -Get in. Get in. OK. OK now. Um, all right. Let me just get these stitches out of you. It's OK. Hold still. [SOBBING] -Shh. Shh. Shh. Just one more. Just one more. [SOBBING] -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Shh. I'm sorry. Crystal, I think he's coming. [SCREAM] -Jesus Christ. [CRYING] -Oh fuck. Fuck! Crystal, you have to be quiet. [CRYING] -Shh. Shh. -Oh my god! -Crystal, be quiet. [SCREAMING] -Melanie? -Penn? Penn, help us. -Come here. Can you walk? -Uh-huh. Crystal, where is she? -I don't know. I didn't-- I didn't see her. -You have to find them. He's been trying to kill us. -Who? Who did this? [SNAP] -No! No. [GASP] -No! No. No. No! No! No! Mary. -You will never take our station. This is my daddy's station. -Mary, why are you doing this? Why? -You will pay for trying to take my home, for taking my father, for taking his life. -It was an accident. -Liar! Liar! I was there! I saw it! I was there! [SMACK] [SMACK] -They killed him, but we made damn sure that they did not build that highway. They won't build it now, because I am gonna shut you up just like I shut up my sister. -Remember, you have to pinch the skin before you put the needle in. Now go ahead and give it a try. -Daddy says you don't know how to be quiet. So now you have to be punished. [MUFFLED SCREAMS] -You sick bitch! She was your sister! -She would never just keep her mouth shut. Nobody will destroy our home. Not them and not you. -Ahh! [SCREAMING] -You're a murderer! [SCREAMING] -Crystal? Crystal! Crystal! -I'm down here. -Crystal, are you OK? -No. -OK. I'm on my way down right now. -Hurry. -OK. OK. All right. We're almost home. Keys. I think I left them in the jacket. [SCREAMING] -I'll teach you just what my daddy taught me! [SCREAMING] [CROSSING BELL] [TRAIN HORN] [CROSSING BELL] -We're all gonna die together! [SCREAMING] -Ahh! [TRAIN HORN] -Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! [TRAIN HORN] -Let me go! [SCREAM] -Oh my god. [SCREAMING] -Oh my god. -Crystal, it's OK. [CRYING] -It's OK. [CRYING] -It's all over. It's OK. [SIRENS] -You ladies OK? Tell me what happened. -I swear it's totally true. -What happened to Melanie and her sister? -I don't know. They say that they left town with their parents. Melanie's mother went insane or something, and they had to put her in a home. -Shit. -I know. And you know what else? They say that those ghost children are still out there on the tracks. -I don't know if this is a good idea. -Just don't piss your pants. OK. Here we go. -Oh my god. -Oh my god. We're actually moving. [GIGGLE] -Oh my god. That was so freaky. -That was so cool. -Well-- [SCREAMING] [TIRES SQUEALING]
