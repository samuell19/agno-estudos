No, no, no, no, no! Daddy! Hello? Hello? Are you all right? Are you hurt? Don't be scared, it's me remember? Are you cold? Oh no, no, no, no. It's okay. See? It's okay. You want some air? Can't you wait. All right, hold still, hold still. Let me help you, here we go. Have this one. Oh, no, no. Okay, now. Your sister does not get off until five. So that gives us the whole day together. Ah, I have lots of ideas. They have boats down at the park now and the ocean is getting warm so we can see the beach or maybe the pier. Oh, remember the merry go round? I still have that picture of you on the black stallion, smiling and riding in circles on that merry go round. It's all up to you. No, no, no, no. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Martin and Associates. Yeah, actually my two o'clock just opened up. Martin and Associates. I mean, you can talk to Bob, but I definitely, I had a long discussion with him and I went over all of... Oh, I know. Martin and Associates. Just popped up on a notification. I don't know, she called me out of the blue. I think we scored her. Great. I'm sure it was your drinks on Friday night. Martin and Associates. Great, so I'll move you to 2:30. I haven't had an entire cup of coffee yet, you're asking way too many questions. Susan today and then I have an open meeting. So she's trying to put it on a property that is essentially worth nothing. It's gotta be two days earlier. For Friday. Exactly we have to meet by Monday. Great, thank you. Martin and Associates. Vandalized? How? What happened? Actually don't call the police. I can be there in 15 minutes. Okay. I almost called the cops. Never do that again. You should have called me. You would have said no. Absolutely! Mom, you've made so much progress. This is a trigger, any memory or memento, it can cause a relapse and I don't wanna come home to... When there is a trigger, what do we do? We recognize it. We recognize it, that's right. And... We deny it. We deny its power, and we let it go. And we let it go. Because? Because when we don't, we get hurt. I'll bring these back when you're ready. But only when you're ready. I just wanted to see him again. I wanna see him again. Mom. She's home. Mom. It's unlocked, again. Mom, I told you when I'm not here, you have to lock up and you have to set the alarm. Honey, honey, I am so glad you're home. There you are, okay, I have a big surprise for you. Mom, do you remember that we talked about you locking up the door when I'm not here? Okay, yeah. And setting the alarm? No, it's totally fine. I just, I'm so excited, please go into the living room and see what's there. Where did you find him? He found me, he came home. Because somebody is going to charge you with kidnapping. Have you called the cops? Who is he? He's your brother. No, Todd is dead, mom. He's dead. He's not coming back. You know what, I think you went off your meds. I told the doctors that if I was gonna supervise you, that you had to be on your meds. He will hear you. Who are you? Do you speak English? Can you hear me? It's okay, tell her. He doesn't understand, mom. Yes, he does, Todd tell her. He doesn't understand, mom. Yes, he does! Then why doesn't he talk? Talk! Wait, wait, wait, hey. Come back! Come back. Yes, he's a seven year old, black and white cat, about nine and a half pounds. Well, the door was open when I got home. No but, he's tried to get out before, I thought I left it closed. Nothing else was stolen. There's no one else here who would have seen anything. We can't keep opening up these wounds. What you did, if you do that again, you're gonna be in serious trouble. Okay? It's probably really sick. I mean, you saw him. He could have hurt you. He could have done something to you. Do you understand? What you did was so dangerous. Hello? No, yes we're okay. Thank you for calling back. No, she's fine too. No, he was just here when I got home. Yeah, I was with her this morning. Uh huh. Never. I have never seen this guy. I mean, and to be completely honest with you, he looked exactly like him. Yeah. I know. Mom. I'm gonna call you back. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom, are you okay? Mom, wake up. I don't understand. You're okay. You're okay, you're okay, you're gonna be okay. It's just, odd. Wait, just wait a second. Just gotta be calm. Mom. Hey, no, no, no, wait, oh. Just wait a second. Hey! I'm not going to hurt you. I just... I don't know who you are or where you came from, but I need you to come back. She's sick, she's really sick. And the only thing that has made it any better is you. So, if you could just... Excuse me. Excuse me. Please, if you just say something. Is that a yes? So I wasn't dreaming? I was afraid that I was asleep and I just imagined you. Thank you for waking me. I wasn't there that day. He'd been sick for so long, I just had to move on. I couldn't be there every day. It was the doctor who called me and when I got to the hospital, she was on the floor crying. That's when I lost them both. I never got to say goodbye. Could only really imagine saying goodbye. You pretended that you were her son, do you think that, do you think that I could pretend like you were my brother? I gave up too soon Todd, far too soon. I miss you every day, and I love you. Goodbye. Honey, sweetie. I'm sorry. You're my baby. Hey, look at you little guy. I have been looking everywhere for you, come here. Did you have a big day?
