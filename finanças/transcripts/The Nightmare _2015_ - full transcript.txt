WARNING The following film contains flashing lights & patterns which can cause epilepsy! WARNING This film contains isochronous sounds and binaural frequencies! Anyway... ...this film should be played loud! What? - How fucking cool is that? - That's not cool, it's gross! Did you show Barbara those things from class? - You took a picture, right? - What? Our biology teacher showed us some embryos today. In jars. Fetuses, freaks and stuff. Oh, that's disgusting! - Look at me. - Hold on. Gross! - Delete it! Right now. - Oh, come on. Why, what is it? Shit, that is awesome! I want one! - Down through there? - Yes, through there. - Come here. - This is awesome! I feel so much better now. Man! Pass me my bag. So, how about we celebrate your birthday here? I don't know. Thanks. And then someone posts it on Facebook and all the creeps show up. Look at me. Shit. Now, let me show you some crazy shit. Fuck! Watch this. Pretty hardcore. What's he doing here? - What? Adam! I thought he couldn't come! - Where? Oh shit! Relax. You look great. Is he looking this way? - Oh, yeah. Is that him? - Oh, please shut up! Where are they coming from? - I bet someone posted it. Well, that's just great. I think I'm starting to feel it. OK, now I'm feeling it! Could you check if someone's there? The last thing I'd need is... ... someone posting a picture of me pissing. Babs! - What? I'm over here! We have to leave! - Why? What happened? Let's just leave! - Okay, but what's wrong? Tina. Fuck! What's wrong? What happened? Moni! Moni, wait. What's up? Did you do the math homework? Oh shit, we've got math tomorrow? - Yeah. Have you done it? - Do I look like I've done it? Are you sure you're okay? - Babs, are you coming? Fuck, my necklace is gone. Babs, have you seen my necklace? - No. Tina! What's going on? You passed out. Come on, try to stand up. Come here, give me the flashlight. Come on. Let's go. Here's your bag. Moni, wait! - What's up? Did you do the math homework? Fuck, do we have math tomorrow? Did you do it? - No. You sure you're alright? Well? Bye, girls. - Bye! Did Adam notice? Sweetie. Shh! She's sleeping. Mom? Can I sleep here with you? No, what? It's... kind of a bad time. What's wrong? - Can't you hear that? What? No. - What? Something's down there. No. - No. Just go back upstairs. Go up, I'll be right there. Hey, can we have a little respect? Please, go back upstairs! Mom! Mom! Mom, there's something really creepy! I'll take a look. There's something in front of the fridge. - Be quiet now. Hello? Hold up. The door is locked. The windows... Tina? They're also locked. - And behind the fridge? Windows... It was just there. In front of the fridge. Honey, it was a nightmare. Come on. God, that was scary. Let's go back to bed. Come on, back to bed. It's a bit of a mess here. - Well... No... And over there? - No, nothing. All good. Well... You can relax. There's nothing unusual. You didn't find anything, right? - No. Everything's alright. It's not that easy. You'd really have to use some force, you know? And I see no signs of a forced entry. A rat, maybe. But that's unlikely. Vents these days are made to prevent that. Where did you see this... 'thing'? It sat in front of the fridge. - Right here? We're not totally 'sure' about this. - May I? Maybe the rat was hungry! That was no rat. It sat here, like this. Tina, please get up. We've seen it. Get up, please. Well, thank you. We'll just have to see. Thank you. Thanks. We could install an alarm. Out front, just to be safe... ... or our "Security 1" deal. But that would cost 20,000 euros. Right. - Or bulletproof glass? You could pay in installments. - Right. But you don't want that, do you? - No. Well, thanks a lot. Great, thank you. - Bye. Let me see! Why are you looking at that? You said you didn't like him. - Well, I don't. And after that night at the pool, he must think I can't handle myself. Well... You can't. Shall we go back in now? - Hey, I was joking! You said... ... that its eyes were blind? But it was still looking at you? Blind eyes. Have you tried... ... talking to it? Well, I would suggest that... ... we... ... we raise your dosage to 1.5 pills per night. You should keep on writing down your dreams and... Next time, why don't you try... ... talking to that 'creature', as you call it. What should I say? Imagine... ... you're on a train, and a stranger keeps staring at you. What would you do? On the train? - Yes. Or at a bus stop, for example. "Hello." "What do you want from me?" What do you want from me? But her losing consciousness is worrisome. If she doesn't improve, or... ... if the fear makes her act irrationally again, we should... ... consider time in a clinic. - Right before her finals? Well, then. Goodbye. - Thank you so much. Do you know what a "fractal" is? It's a fusion of religion and science. It's an image of God. It's proof that he exists... ... and we'll be resurrected. Do you know why? Because it's a cycle. Day and night. Winter and Summer. It turns and turns. Molecules. Stars. Blood in the body. Rain that evaporates, just to rain down again. Human existence is not a fluke. Einstein said... ... there are no flukes. Do you know what he said? He said: "God doesn't play dice." He said that. "No rolling dices." Dude. What is that? Do you need to know everything? - If that's another one of those sluts... What does that mean, "No problem?" Nothing. Tell me. It's from my brother. He's working at that event supplies place. I asked for a sound system, so that I could DJ on your birthday. And it's "No problem." Really? Yeah. At my Dad's house. He's away until the end of August. Did you hear that, Babs? Adam is going to DJ on my birthday. At his parents' house. What are you doing here? - Shouldn't you be home already? Don't let me distract you. Or do you want to see how it's done? Can't you kick her out? Seriously, does your Mom know you're here? Sweetie. Why? I'm already going to therapy. - Yes, but Dr. Dreison... ... isn't right for you. Here they'll... - But I'm not a freak! "Freak" is a stupid and derogatory word. I don't want to stay here! Come along now so I can show you the rest. Please come along. Here, take a look. This is your room. But it's way too small. I won't fit in there! This is what. She thinks she's that 'creature.' I see. - I don't want to do this! Please, no! - Stop it! You'll hurt yourself. [Mother:] Hi, you've reached the mailbox of Vera- [Father:] Hi, you've reached- What do you want from me? No, I don't want any eggs. They give me a rash. All over. Do you understand? Yes? - Hey, Tina! What's up? We're in front of your door, open up! - What? We're outside. Not now. I really can't- - What? Stop messing around. Open up! What's going on? Just the two of you, okay? Can't we all come in? Just for a second? Is there a guy here? Moni, you've got the rolling papers! - He's really pissing me off. Stop bullshitting! - I'm not! I'm gonna show you something. Don't tell anyone, okay? Do you promise? - Sure. Guys, relax. Let's just wait. - They could at least give us the papers! You'll think I'm strange but it was just there, and... ... now it's gone. What's gone? I'm kidding! I'm just kidding, guys. Do you want a drink? Cola? Babs, you can go join the others outside... And I'll clean this up. Moni, could you help me out? Sure. Have you seen Babs? Adam? How long do you want to stay? Can I sleep at your place? Tonight's kind of bad. But tomorrow, sure! Shit. Shit. Absolutely. - They're not doing so well, and. Hello. - Mom? Mom! Mom! Tini! Tina! It was just here. - What's going on? Your mouth! Open your mouth. Show me your tongue! I just bit my tongue. Why is this bloody? I just wanted to shave my legs. Stop staring! The moment you get back there's trouble. Stop pissing me off, I'm fine! Nobody thinks you're 'cool' if you hurt yourself, honey. Not Adam, not anybody. - Mom, I didn't hurt myself. It's not- - I didn't! Mom, I'm not a psycho. You got me so worried. I just want you to tell me what's wrong. I won't say anything. I'll believe you. Just tell me what's wrong, honey. Okay, Mom. You two were out and I was in bed asleep. Then I woke up and my mouth was bleeding. I went to the bathroom, I wanted to stop it. I looked around and there it was, again. It's always there. I hate that you can lie to me like this. It just feels horrible. Why? Mom, I'm not lying. Mom, I'm not lying! Hey... I'm not lying. Have you ever touched it? - What? Have you ever touched that 'thing'? Why? - Have you ever touched that creature? No! Do you see? You can't really know if it exists or not. Take a look at this. Do you see that? Do you see how the pencil suddenly appears so soft? Yes. Only once I've touched it... ... can I feel that it's made from hard wood. So? Our brains, Antonia... Our brains are the biggest mystery on earth, trust me. And sometimes they play tricks on us. I'm doing it already! There we go. Looks great! But we still need napkins. What's this? What are you doing looking in my bag? It fell off. I wanted to tell you... It just fell off. From your room? But can't you just put it back on? Could you take a look? Dad, stop being stupid! Not now! We'll have to talk about this. Anyway! Good evening, this is Tina. - It's a pleasure. Well, about Tina... ... she's going through a difficult time right now. But she's handling it really well. Well, we all have our issues, don't we? But with Tina it's really a big issue. It's why she's in therapy. Dr. Raimund Gruete, he's... ... a neurologist we know. He's from Berlin... He's the best in Berlin. He said he was quite surprised how stable Tina's condition is. How many times have you been, Tina? I don't know. - Like, eight times? Actually, one was canceled. Seven times. Yes, but it takes time. You can't say how long it- I'll just go upstairs, the window is rattling. Tina, please. We had a deal. We're staying together until we're all done. Would anybody like some wine? That was a one-time chance! He won't visit again. Let's be honest, there wasn't even a chance to talk. You saw what kind of mood they were in when they left. Everyone was bored, they just endured it. Babs, didn't you say that you saw things as a child? Yeah, so? It's just - I know what you mean. Really? Do you want some? Listen to me! It feels what I feel! Open up, I need to piss! You're not the only ones here! - Dude, chill out! Man! Think I'm fucking with you, right? No, I don't. We're friends, I believe you. Can't you be quiet? Vera! What are you doing? Leave the girl alone, will you? Can't you hear that? That doesn't sound normal! Where did you get that key? - I had it cut. Vera, don't you think that this is unfair? Tina! Tina! Stop! Stop! What are they doing? What are they doing to him? I want to be there! Daniel! As I said, take the tablets twice a day for a week. And when she's feeling better, one should be enough. To be taken before breakfast. - Okay. Thanks so much. You're welcome. Take good care of her. We will. Good bye. - Bye. Where did he go? Is he gone? - Sleep, darling. You've got a fever. Did they just take him? Take who? Who do you mean? Don't lie. You saw him too. You're burning up. - You saw him though, right? And now you're lying so I don't freak out. Honey, Mom is right, you really need to sleep. She just took everything out of the fridge... ... and threw it all over the kitchen. It looked like a bomb had gone off. Guys, I don't think it's anything to do with drugs. It could be. - But it just isn't normal. What does she say about it? Have you asked her? Don't tell me she said it was aliens. Or a conspiracy! Or, dude, it was like some kind of creature! Seriously? Are you shitting me? Little 'creatures'? Guys, stop it. - You shouldn't be saying this stuff. Right. She's coming. - Let's smoke a joint? Didn't we want to...? - I need to copy some stuff. See you. - Later. Are you alright? Sure. And you? They were talking shit about you. - Why? What? What are they saying? Fuck it. People talk shit about me too. Did she say something? Forget it. - I don't forget shit, bitch! Mind your own business. And please... ... don't compare yourself to me. We're nothing alike. Do you know what you are? Just a tiny fucking freak! Yeah? Well, I'm not the one who sees little creatures! Bla bla bla... little creatures! You tell crazy stories to get attention... ... and you're calling me a freak? Adam? Give me your hand. - I don't want any fucking pills! Tina, stop! That's enough! Take the glass! OK, you do it. Hold her still. OK. Now swallow. Stop it! - Here's one pill. Where's the other? Swallow the last one before I get angry. I don't want to! - Stop it. Open up. Now swallow it down. Was that so hard? Shall I put these over there? - No, put them on the table. Hi Moni, it's Tina. Where are you guys? I just wanted to ask if my birthday at Adam's is actually happening? If my birthday at Adam's is happening! Moni, could you go somewhere quieter? I can't hear you. Because that's tonight and I don't know when to come! Moni? Tina? Did I just hear that you want to go to a party at this Adam's house? Yeah, and? In your condition? Let's just bring her something tomorrow, like... ... "Belated Happy Birthday." If they don't want you there- - Of course they want me there! They're my friends. Do you want to come downstairs and open some presents? Come here, my big girl. Let's do this properly: Happy Birthday! Let's sit down. Would you like to open your presents? This one is from Dad and me. - The biggest one! This one's from me. And that's from... ... your Granny. Let's start with that. Or shall we we start with the cake? - Good idea! I'll get the cake. Do you know what I looked like on my 18th? I saw a picture the other day at my parents' place. I was just saying how I looked on my 18th birthday. We knew each other but weren't a couple yet... ... and I had sort of a grown out 'pop' haircut. Candles! Could you pass me the matches? And a sweater from my brother but the coolest thing was... ... Tina, I had these jeans- - You and your old stories! Jeans with pleats, sort of 'carrot' pants. They had this checkered pattern- - What is this? Give that to me. Let's not talk about that today. It's your birthday. We'll discuss that tomorrow... Yes, let's sit down and talk about it tomorrow. Ok? Wait, don't go! Let me go! - Tina! Yes, hello Mrs. Ni-Gong, it's Vera Petersen. I'm looking for Tina, is she maybe... at your place? Where are the car keys? - I don't know. Well? When we leave, you'll have to... ... be quiet. Hello? Can I help you? Now. Now we'll see who's crazy, won't we? HAPPY BIRTHDAY Let's go. Come. Fuck! - Lost something? - No. All good. You want a drink? - What are you drinking? - Vodka Red Bull, but there's also... - ...water. - Cola. - Apple spritzer. - No. I'll have a Vodka Red Bull too. OK, I'll get one. Tina! Why are you here? I thought you were sick? I'm doing great! Can't you see that? Yes, I can. You look great. Really? Really. Oh my God! That's him. Moni! Oh shit! - Tina, what are you doing? - Tina! Tina, don't touch it! Tina? Slowly, come over here. Come here, honey. It's alright. Slowly, come here. - Tina it's alright! - Dad, he won't hurt me. Leave him be!
